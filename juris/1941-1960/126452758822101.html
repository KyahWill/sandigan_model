				<H3>ANICETO ALCANTARA, PETITIONER, VS. DIRECTOR OP PRISONS, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is a petition for the issuance  of  a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> and  for the release of the  petitioner on  the  ground that the latter is  unlawfully imprisoned and  restrained of his liberty  by the respondent  Director of Prisons in the provincial jail at  Vigan, Ilocos Sur.</p>
<p>Petitioner was  convicted by  the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur (Criminal  case No. 23) of the crime of illegal discharge of firearms with less  serious  physical injuries. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals of Northern Luzon at Baguio modified said sentence (CA-G.  R. No. 790) and sentenced the petitioner to an indeterminate penalty  of from four months and twenty-one days of <em>arresto mayor</em> to three years, nine months and three days of <em>prision correccional</em>. The sentence as  modified  became final on September  12, 1944, and on June 23, 1945, petitioner commenced serving his sentence.</p>
<p>Petitioner now questions the validity of the  decision of the Court of Appeals of  Northern Luzon, on the  sole ground that said court was only  a creation  of  the  so-called Republic  of the Philippines during the Japanese  military occupation  of the Islands; that the Court of Appeals was not authorized by Commonwealth Act No. 3 to  hold sessions in Baguio,  and that  only  two Justices  constituted the majority which promulgated  the decision in question. The petitioner does not question  the validity of said decision on the strength of the Proclamation of General Douglas MaeArthur of October  23,  1944,.which  according  to  our decision in the case of Co Kim Cham<em> vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, G. R. No. L-5  (p.  113, <em>ante</em>), does not refer to judicial processes.</p>
<p>In the said case of Co Kim  Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, this Court ruled that  the so-called Republic of the Philippines and the  Philippine Executive Commission established in the Philippines during the Japanese regime were governments <em>de facto</em> organized by  the belligerent occupant, and the judicial acts thereof were good and valid and remained good and valid after the restoration of the Commonwealth Government, except those  of  a political complexion.   In that  same  case this Court held that the Court of Appeals which was continued throughout the Japanese  occupation,  was  the  same  Court  of Appeals  that existed prior to the Japanese  occupation and was lately abolished  by Executive  Order  No. 37.  The division  of the Court of Appeals into several  District Courts of Appeals, and the reduction of the  number of Justices  sitting in each division,  during the regime of  the  so-called Republic, effected no  substantial  change in its nature and jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Even assuming that the Court of Appeals of Northern Luzon was a  new court created  by the belligerent occupant or the <em>de facto</em> governments established by him, the judgments of such court,  like those of the courts which were continued  during  the Japanese  occupation,  were good and valid and remain good and valid, and therefore enforceable now after the liberation or occupation of the Philippines, provided that such judgments do  not have a political complexion, as this  court  held  in  its  decision  in  the  above- mentioned case  of Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon  <em>supra</em>, in accordance  with the  authorities therein cited.</p>
<p>Obviously, the sentence which petitioner is now serving has no  political complexion.  He was charged with  and convicted of  an offense punishable  under  the municipal law of the Commonwealth, the Revised Penal Code.  Therefore, the sentence of  the Court of First Instance of Uocos Sur, as  modified by the Court of Appeals of Northern Luzon, is valid and enforceable.</p>
<p>A punitive or penal sentence is said to be of a political complexion when it penalizes  either a new act not defined in the municipal laws, or acts already penalized by the latter as a crime against the legitimate government, but taken out of  the territorial law and penalized as new offenses committed against the belligerent occupant, incident to a state of  war and necessary for the control of the occupied territory and the protection of the army of the occupier.  They are acts penalized for public rather than private  reasons, acts which tend, directly  or  indirectly, to aid or favor the  enemy and  are directed against the welfare, safety and security  of the belligerent  occupant.</p>
<p>As examples,  the  crimes against national  security, such as treason, espionage, etc., and against public order, such as rebellion, sedition, etc., were crimes against the Commonwealth or United States  Government under the Revised  Penal Code, which were  made crimes against the belligerent occupant.</p>
<p>In view  of  the foregoing, the petition for the writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras, Jaranilla, Pablo</em>, and <em>Bengzon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>DE JOYA, J., </strong></p>
<p>The principal question involved in this<em> habeas corpus</em> case is the validity of the judicial  proceedings held, during the Japanese  occupation, in the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, in which herein petitioner was accused of frustrated murder, and in the Court of Appeals of Northern Luzon, in which, on appeal, said petitioner was found guilty of illegal discharge of firearms with  less  serious physical injuries, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment ranging from four months and twenty-one days of <em>arresto mayor</em> to three years, nine  months and three days of <em>prision correcional</em>; and the effect on said proceedings of the proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur, dated October 23, 1944.  The decision of this question requires the application of principles of International Law, in connection with the municipal law of this country.</p>
<p>Under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, International Law is a  part of the fundamental law of the land (Article II, sec. 3).  As International  Law is an integral part of our law, it must be ascertained and administered by this Court,  whenever questions  of right depending upon it  are presented for our  determination (Kansas <em>vs.</em> Colorado, 185 U. S., 146; 22 Sup.  Ct., 552; 46 Law.  ed., 838).</p>
<p>Since International Law is a body of rules  accepted by nations as regulating their mutual relations, the proof of their  existence is to be found in the  consent of nations to abide by them; and this  consent is  evidenced chiefly by the usages and customs of nations, as found in the writings of publicists and in the decisions of  the highest courts of the different  countries of the world  (The Habana, 175 U. S., 677; 20 Sup. Ct, 290; 44 Law. ed., 320).</p>
<p>But while usages and customs are the older and original source of International Law, great international treaties are a later  source  of increasing importance, such as The Hague Conventions of  1899  and  1907.</p>
<p>The Hague Convention of 1899, respecting laws and customs  of war on land, expressly  declares that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"ARTICLE XLII. Territory is considered  occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army.</p>
  <p>"The occupation applies only to the territory where such  authority is established, and  in a  position to assert itself.</p>
  <p>ART.  XLII. The authority of the legitimate power having actually passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all steps in his power to reestablish and insure, as far as possible, public order  and  safety, while respecting,  unless absolutely prevented,  the laws in force in the country."  (32 Stat, II, 1821.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above provisions of The Hague Conventions have been adopted by  the nations giving adherence to them, among which is the United States of America (32 Stat., II, 1821).</p>
<p>The commander in chief of the invading forces or military occupant  may  exercise governmental authority, but only when in actual possession of the enemy's territory, and  this  authority  will be exercised  upon principles of International Law (New Orleans<em> vs.</em> Steamship Co.  [1874], 20 Wall., 387; Kelly <em>vs.</em> Sanders  [1878], 99  U.  S., 441; Macleod<em> vs.</em> United  States, 229 U.  S., 416; 33 Sup Ct., 955; 57 Law.  ed., 1260;  II Oppenheim  on International Law, sec. 167).</p>
<p>It will thus  be readily  seen that the civil laws  of the invaded state continue in force, in so far as they  do not affect the hostile occupant unfavorably.   The regular judicial tribunals of the occupied territory continue to act in cases not affecting the military occupation, and it is not usual  for the  invader to  take  the  whole  administration into his own hands, because it is easier to preserve order through the agency of the native officials, and also because the latter are more  competent to  adininister the laws of the territory; and the military occupant  generally keeps in their posts such of the judicial and administrative officers as are willing  to serve under  him, subjecting them only to supervision  by the military  authorities, or  by superior  civil authorities appointed by him (Young <em>vs.</em> United States, 97 U. S., 39;  24 Law. ed., 992; Coleman <em>vs.</em> Tennessee, 97 U. S., 509; 24 Law. ed., 1118; Macleod <em>vs.</em> United States, 229  U. S., 416; 33 Sup Ct., 955; 57 Law. ed., 1260 Taylor, International Law, sees. 576,  578; Wilson, International Law, pp. 331-337; Hall, International Law, 6th ed. [1909], pp. 464, 465, 475, 476; Lawrence, International Law, 7th ed., pp. 412, 413; Davis, Elements  of International  Law, 3d  ed., pp. 330-332, 335; Holland, International Law, pp. 356, 357, 359; Westlake, International Law, Part II, War, 2d ed., pp. 121-123).</p>
<p>In 1811, during the occupation of Catalonia, Spain, by the French army, a Frenchman, accused of the murder of a  Catalan  in  that  province, was tried and convicted by the assize Court of the Department of the Pyrenees Orientales, France.   Upon appeal to the French Court of Cassation, the conviction was quashed, on the ground that the courts of the  territory within which the crime had been committed  had exclusive jurisdiction to try the  case and that "the occupation  of Catalonia  by French  troops and its government  by  the French authorities  had not  communicated to its inhabitants the  character of French citizens, nor to their territory the character of French territory, and that such character could only be acquired by a  solemn act  of incorporation which had not been  gone through."  (Hall, International Law, 6th ed., p.  461.)</p>
<p>It is, therefore, evident that the establishment  of the government under the name of the Philippine Executive Commission,  or the so-called Philippine  Republic,  afterwards,  during Japanese occupation, respecting the  laws in force in the country, and permitting our courts to function and administer said laws, as proclaimed in  the City of Manila, by  the commander in chief of the Japanese Imperial Forces,  on January 3, 1942, was in accordance with the rules and principles of International Law.</p>
<p>If the military occupant  is thus  in duty bound to establish in the  territory under military occupation governmental  agencies for the preservation of peace and  order and for the proper administration of justice, in accordance with the local laws, it must  necessarily follow  that the judicial proceedings conducted before the courts established by the military occupant must be considered legal and valid, even  after  said government established  by the military occupant had been displaced by the legitimate goverament of the territory.</p>
<p>Thus the judgments rendered by the Confederate Courts, during the American Civil War, merely setting the rights of private parties actually within their  jurisdiction,  not tending to defeat the legal rights of citizens of the United States, nor  in  furtherance of  laws passed in aid  of  the rebellion,  had been declared  valid and binding  (Cook <em>vs.</em> Oliver, 1 Woods, 437; Fed. Cas., No. 3, 164;  Coleman<em> vs.</em> Tennessee, 97 U. S., 509; 24 Law. ed., 1118; Williams <em>vs.</em> Bruffy, 96 U. S., 176; Horn <em>vs.</em> Lockhart, 17 Wall., 570; Sprott <em>vs.</em> United States,  20  Wall., 459;  Texas <em>vs. </em>White, 7 Wall., 700; Ketchum <em>vs.</em> Buckley [1878], 99  U. S., 188); and the judgment of a court of Georgia  rendered in November, 1861, for the purchase money of slaves was held valid  judgment when entered, and  enforceable in 1871 (French <em>vs.</em> Tumllin,  10 Am.  Law. Reg. [N. S.], 641; Fed. Case,  No. 5104).</p>
<p>The judgments rendered by the courts of the states constituting the Confederate States of America were considered legal and valid and enforceable, even after the termination of the American Civil War, because they had been rendered by the courts of a <em>de facto</em> government.   The  Confederate States were a <em>de facto</em> government, in the sense that its citizens were  bound to render the government obedience in civil matters, and  did not become responsible, as wrongdoers, for such acts of obedience  (Thorington <em>vs.</em> Smith, 8 Wall. [U.  S.] 9; 19 Law. ed., 361).</p>
<p>In the more recent case of Ketchum <em>vs.</em> Buckley ([1878], 99 U. S.,  188), the  Supreme Court of the United  States held—"It  is now settled law  in this court that during the late civil war the same general form of  government,  the same  general  law for the administration of  justice and the protection of private rights, which had existed in the States prior to the rebellion, remained during its continuance and afterwards.  As far as the acts of the States did  not impair or tend  to impair  the supremacy of the national authority, or the just rights of the citizens, under the Constitution, they are in general to be treated  as valid and binding."   (Williams <em>vs.</em> Bruffy, 96 U. S.,  176; Horn <em>vs.</em> Lockharfc, 17 Wall.,  570;  Sprott <em>vs.</em> United States, 20 Wall, 459; Texas <em>vs.</em> White, 7 Wall., 700.)</p>
<p>The  government established in the  Philippines,  during Japanese occupation, would seem to fall under the following definition of de facto  government given by the Supreme Court of the  United States:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"But  there is another description  of government, called also by publicists a government <em>de facto</em>, but which might, perhaps, be more aptly  denominated a  government  of  paramount force.  Its distinguishing characteristics are  (1) that its existence is maintained by active military  power within  the territories, and against the rightful authority of an established and lawful government; and  (2)  that while  it exists it must necessarily be obeyed in civil matters by private citizens who, by acts of  obedience rendered in submission to such force, do not become responsible, as wrongdoers, for those acts, though not warranted by the laws of the rightful government.  Actual governments of this sort are established over districts differing greatly  in extent and conditions. They  are usually administered directly  by  military authority, but they  may be administered, also, by civil authority, supported more or less directly by military force." (MacLeod <em>vs.</em> United States [1913], 229 U. S., 416.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  government established  in  the  Philippines,  under the Philippine Executive  Commission or under the so-called Philippine Republic, during Japanese occupation, was and should, therefore, be  considered  as a <em>de facto</em> government; and  that  the judicial  proceedings  conducted before  the courts which had  been established in this country,  during said Japanese occupation, are and should be considered legal and valid and enforceable, even after the liberation of this country by the  American forces, as long as  said  judicial proceedings had been conducted, in accordance with  the law of  the Commonwealth  of the  Philippines.</p>
<p>The judicial proceedings involved  in  the case under consideration merely refer to the prosecution of the petitioner in this case,  for the  crime of  frustrated murder, which was reduced to illegal discharge of firearms with less serious physical injuries, under the provisions of the Revised Penal Code, in force in this country under the  Commonwealth government, before and during Japanese occupation.</p>
<p>Now, petitioner contends that the judicial proceedings in question  are null and void, and that the accused should be immediately released from custody, under the provisions of the proclamation issued by General Douglas MacArthur, dated October 23, 1944; as said proclamation nullifies all the laws,  regulations and processes of any other government in the Philippines than that of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.</p>
<p>In other words, petitioner demands a literal interpretation of said proclamation issued by General MacArthur, a contention which, in our opinion, is untenable, as it would inevitably produce judicial chaos and uncertainties.   When an act is susceptible of two or more constructions, one of which will maintain and the others destroy it, the Courts will always adopt the former  (United States <em>vs.</em> Coombs [1838], 12 Pet., 72; 9 Law. ed., 1004; Board of Supervisors of Grenada  County <em>vs.</em> Brown [1884],  112 U. S., 261; 28 Law. ed., 704; 5 Sup. Ct. Rep., 125; In re Guarina [1913], 24 Phil, 37; Fuentes<em> vs.</em> Director of Prisons [1924], 46 Phil., 22; Yu Cong Eng <em>vs. </em>Trinidad [1925], 47 Phil., 385). The judiciary, always alive to the dictates of national welfare, can properly incline the scales of its decisions in favor of that solution  which will most effectively  promote the public policy (Smith, Bell &amp; Co., Ltd. <em>vs.</em> Natividad [1919], 40 Phil., 136).  All laws should receive a sensible construction as  not to lead  to injustice, oppresion or an absurd consequence.  It  will  always, therefore, be  presumed that the legislature intended exceptions to its language, which would avoid results of this character.   The reason of the law in such cases should prevail over its  letter (United States <em>vs.</em> Kirby, 7 Wall. [U. S.], 482; 19 Law. ed, 278; Church  of Holy Trinity vs. United States, 143 U. S., 461; 12  Sup.  Ci, 511; 36 Law. ed., 226; Jacobson  <em>vs.</em> Massachusetts, 197 U. S., 39; 25 Sup. Ct, 358; 49 Law. ed., 643; 3 Ann. Cas., 765;<em> In re</em> Allen, 2 Phil., 630).  The duty of the court in construing a statute, which is reasonably susceptible of two constructions to adopt that which saves its constitutionality, includes the duty of avoiding a construction which  raises grave and  doubtful constitutional questions, if  it can be avoided (United States <em>vs.</em> Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., 213 U. S., 366; 29 Sup. Ct., 527; 53 Law.  ed., 836).</p>
<p>According to the rules  and principles of International Law, and the legal doctrines cited above, the judicial proceedings  conducted before the courts of justice, established here during Japanese military occupation, merely applying the provisions of the  municipal law of the territory,  as the provisions of the Revised Penal Code in the instant case, which have no  political  or military  significance, are and should be considered legal, valid and binding.   It is to be presumed that  General  Douglas  MacArthur knows said rules and principles of International Law, as International Law is an integral part of the fundamental law of the land, in accordance with  the  provisons of the  Constitution of the United  States.  And it  is  also to be presumed that General MacArthur has acted, in accordance with said principles of  Internationa] Law, which have been sanctioned by the Supreme Court of the United States, as the nullification of all judicial proceedings conducted before our courts, during Japanese occupation, would  be  highly detrimental to public  interests.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons,  I concur in the majority opinion, and  the petition for habeas corpus filed in this case should, therefore, be denied.</p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERPECTO, J.,</strong></p>
<p>Following our opinions in the  cases of Co  Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (p. 153, <em>ante</em>), and Peralta<em> vs.</em> Director of Prisons (p. 334, <em>ante</em>), G. R. No. L—5 and G. R. No. L~49, respectively,  the proceedings attacked by petitioner belong to the judicial processes declared null and void in the proclamation issued by General MacArthur on October 23,  1944, and, therefore, we vote for the granting of the writ of habeas corpus prayed for.</p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.,</strong></p>
<p>Upon the grounds stated in my main dissenting opinion in G. R. No. L-5, Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon  (p. 199, <em>ante</em>), in my  dissenting opinion upon the motion for reconsideration therein (p. 398, ante), and in my concurring opinion in G. R. No. L-49, Peralta <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons (p. 355,  <em>ante</em>), I dissent  from the opinion of the majority herein.  The writ of habeas corpus sought by petitioner should be granted because of the nullity of the judgment and proceedings under which he has been imprisoned and restrained of his liberty.  As stated in the majority opinion, the sentence against him became final on September 12, 1944, and had been pronounced by the Japanese-sponsored Court of Appeals of Northern Luzon upon appeal from  a judgment of conviction by the Japanese- sponsored Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur.<br>
