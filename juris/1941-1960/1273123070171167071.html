				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing 
appellant's petition for a writ of execution to enforce an alleged judgment of 
the Wage Administration Service.<p></p>
<p>The record shows that sometime in 1955, the appellant Isidore Cebrero filed a 
claim with the WAS (Wage Administration Service) against the respondent Jose 
Talaman, herein appellee, proprietor of a restaurant at Quezon Boulevard, 
Manila, where the appellant was working, for underpayment, overtime pay and 
additional compensation for services rendered on Sundays and holidays and for 
separation-pay. Summoned to a conference, the parties appeared before the 
regional investigator assigned to the case; but as the respondent denied 
liability on the claim, no amicable settlement resulted. Neither did the parties 
agree to submit the case for arbitration. But despite the absence of such 
agreement the regional investigator heard evidence for the claimant and 
questioned the respondent, who was then unassisted by counsel, and thereafter 
rendered a so-called "judgment" for the sum of P2,240.94 and advised the deposit 
thereof in his office.</p>
<p>Notified of the "judgment", the respondent, through counsel, filed a motion 
for reconsideration and new trial, alleging that he had appeared before the 
investigator merely to be questioned on matters incident to the operation of his 
business and not to answer formal charges and defend himself in an investigation 
that was to go into the merits of a money claim against him and that for that 
reason he was not assisted by counsel. The motion was denied by the 
investigator, but at respondent's request the chief of the regional office 
reassigned the case to another investigator for re-investigation. The latter, 
however, desisted from taking further action in the case on being informed that 
the same had already been taken to the City Fiscal of Manila for proper criminal 
action.</p>
<p>On the theory that the "judgment" of the WAS investigator had already become 
final because the same was not appealed, the claimant Isidoro Cebrero petitioned 
the Court of First Instance of Manila to order its execution. But the court, 
after hearing, decided to dismiss the petition without prejudice, holding in 
effect that the judgment in question was not proper, the same having been 
rendered without an agreement to arbitrate. Reconsideration of this decision 
having been denied, the claimant appealed directly to this Court, the question 
involved being purely legal.</p>
<p>Under Republic Act No. 602, known as the Minimum Wage Law, an employee is 
authorized to bring an action. in the regular courts for the recovery of unpaid 
wages. But before taking such action, he is also given the option to try to 
collect his claim extra judicially through the mediation of the Wage 
Administration Service (called WAS for short), an office created in that same 
Act, the said office being for that purpose empowered to mediate and bring about 
an amicable settlement, to arbitrate the claim if there is an agreement to 
submit it for arbitration or, if no amicable settlement or agreement to 
arbitrate is arrived at, to investigate the claim and file an action in court if 
the claim is found meritorious and the claimant is without counsel.</p>
<p>The procedure to govern the filing and prosecution of claims of this nature 
in the WAS is set forth in a Code of Rules and Regulations promulgated by the 
chief of that office under the authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 
section 11 of the Act. The pertinent provisions of that code read:</p>
<p align="center">"B. MEDIATION</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 6. At the opening of the initial conference, the claims investigator or 
claims attorney shall endeavor to reconcile the parties and induce them to 
settle the claim by amicable agreement. If any agreement as to the whole or part 
of the claim is arrived at between the parties a memorandum of its terms shall 
be made in writing, signed and acknowledged by the parties, thereto before the 
claims investigator or claims attorney. Such agreement shall dispose of the 
claim in whole or in part, as the case may be.</p>
<p>"SEC. 7. The period to mediate on any claim shall in no case exceed one week 
from the initial conference.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p align="center">"C. ARBITRATION</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"SEC. 9. If no amicable agreement is arrived at between the 
parties on the whole or any part of the claim, the claims investigator or claims 
attorney shall immediately ask the parties whether they are willing to submit 
the case for arbitration by the Service with him or any other claims attorney or 
investigator acting as arbitrator, whose decision shall be binding, final and 
conclusive between them, the agreement to arbitrate shall be made in writing and 
signed by the parties before the claims investigator or claims attorney. In case 
of arbitration, the hearing on the claim shall not exceed one week, from the 
initiation thereof.</p></blockquote>
<div align="center">"D. PROSECUTION 
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 14. In the event that mediation fails and the parties are not willing 
to arbitrate, the claim shall immediately be assigned to a claims attorney, who 
will investigate the claimant and his witnesses to find out if such claim is 
meritorious or not. If meritorious, the attorney will prepare the corresponding 
complaint and petition for indigency for court action, as the case may be, 
within one week after receiving the same."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear from the above provisions of the Code of Rules and Regulations 
for the implementation of the Act that where an employee, instead of going 
directly to court, files his claim with the WAS, that office, through an 
investigator assigned to the case, should first call the parties to a conference 
and endeavor to effect an amicable settlement; that if no amicable agreement is 
arrived at, the investigator should ask the parties if they are willing to 
submit the case for arbitration; and that if mediation fails and the parties are 
not willing to arbitrate, the claim shall immediately be assigned to a claims 
attorney, who shall then "investigate the claimant and his witnesses to find out 
if such claim is meritorious or not" and who, if he finds the claim meritorious 
"will prepare the corresponding complaint and petition for indigency for court 
action".</p>
<p>It is obvious that the WAS investigator assigned to the present case went 
beyond what the Code of Rules and Regulations of that office authorizes for 
without the parties having arrived at an amicable settlement or submitted the 
case for arbitration, he investigated the case and then rendered a "judgment" 
for a sum of money. That so-called judgment with its "findings" was no judgment 
at all, that is, a judgment that could be enforced through a writ of execution. 
Under the code of rules above mentioned, it is nothing more than a finding that 
the claim is meritorious and justifies the filing of a complaint in court.</p>
<p>Appellant, citing the case of Brillantes vs. Castro (99" Phil., 497; 56 Off. 
Gaz., [29], 4621), contends that even without an arbitration agreement the 
decision of the WAS Investigator becomes final if not appealed. The contention 
is without basis. Actually, the decision of the WAS in that case was predicated 
on an agreement to arbitrate and, contrary to the impression that appellant 
seeks to convey, we did not there hold that even without such an agreement the 
decision of the WAS would be final if not appealed. Indeed, the rule already 
adopted by this Court on this point is to the contrary. Thus, in the case of 
Nestle vs. Secretary of Labor et al. (G. K. No. L-11630) and then again in 
Elizalde &amp; Co., Inc., et al. vs. Arnado, et al. (G. R. No. L-11592), this 
Court, acting on a petition to review a so-called decision of the WAS rendered 
without an agreement to arbitrate, adopted the following resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Considering that Section 14 of the Code of Rules and Regulations to 
implement the Minimum Wage Law (Rep. Act No. 602) provides that 'in the event 
that mediation fails and the parties are not willing to arbitrate, the claims 
shall immediately be assigned to a claims attorney, who will investigate the 
claimant and his witnesses to find out if such claim is meritorious or not. If 
meritorious, the attorney -will prepare the corresponding petition for court 
action, as the case may be within one week after receipt of the case', and 
considering further that this case falls squarely within the provisions of 
Section 16 of said Minimum Wage Law, which confers on Courts of First Instance 
jurisdiction to restrain violations of this Act and provides that 'Action by the 
Secretary (of Labor) or by the employees affected to recover underpayment may be 
brought in any competent court', the Court Resolved to dismiss the petition, 
without prejudice to whatever right the petitioner may have to defend her 
interests in this case by filing the corresponding action before the competent 
Court of First Instance." (See Minutes of December 14 and 18, 1956; see also 
Franklin Baker Co. of the Phil. vs. Malasmas, dismissed by minute resolution on 
Jan. 23, 1957.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs 
against the appellant.</p>
