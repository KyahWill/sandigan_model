				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff&nbsp; brought&nbsp; this action to&nbsp; compel&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Rice and Corn Corporation commonly known as "NARIC" to reinstate him&nbsp; to his position as warehouseman&nbsp; in warehouse No. 9-B;&nbsp; to pay him his back salaries at P190&nbsp; per month&nbsp; from&nbsp; 30&nbsp; June&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; his&nbsp; suspension, until reinstated,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with lawful interest from.the date&nbsp; of the filing of the&nbsp; complaint (10 June 1954) ; to pay him the&nbsp; sum of P5,000 by way of&nbsp; actual&nbsp; and moral damages and P2,000 by way of exemplary damages; to pay him his&nbsp; accumulated sick and vacation leave of&nbsp; five months amounting to P950 at the rate of P190 a month&nbsp; and to pay him&nbsp; his severance pay under NARIC Resolution&nbsp; No. 416, which&nbsp; provides one month salary for every year of service, amounting to PI,900 corresponding to ten months, should he no&nbsp; longer be entitled to reinstatement.&nbsp; He further prays for&nbsp; such other and further relief as law and justice may warrant.&nbsp;&nbsp; In support of his prayer he alleges that on 30 June 1950 he was suspended as warehouseman of warehouse No. 9-B by,the Assistant General Manager of the NARIC when it&nbsp; was reported by the Inventory Committee that there was a shortage of 4,775 sacks valued at P24,750 in the total number of sacks entrusted to his custody and responsibility as&nbsp; such warehouseman; that he was suspended upon recommendation of a committee which investigated the case but without affording him a chance to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and to be heard and to defend&nbsp; himself; that the case was brought to the City Fiscal's&nbsp; Office and after investigation he was charged with malversation in&nbsp; an information filed before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila of which he was tried and acquitted&nbsp; on 20&nbsp; September 1.952; that despite his acquittal and demand to be reinstated&nbsp; and paid&nbsp; his&nbsp; salary&nbsp; during&nbsp; suspension,&nbsp; the' defendant refused to do so; that he appealed to the Secretary of Economic.

subject to the approval of the Secretary of Economic Coordination..<br><br>The NARIC admits the pleaded facts in&nbsp; paragraphs 1, 2' and 5 of the first cause of action but alleges that plaintiff's position as warehouseman was of a highly&nbsp; confidential nature and his suspension was adopted as a precautionary measure; denies&nbsp; those alleged in paragraphs&nbsp; 3 and 4 of the first cause of action, avers that the plaintiff was notified of&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing of the&nbsp; committee but&nbsp; failed to&nbsp; appear, and denies finally those stated in paragraphs 10&nbsp; and 11 of the first cause of action referring to&nbsp; actual, moral and exemplary damages as under the law they are not recoverable states that the salary of the plaintiff is not as alleged in paragraph 12 of the first cause of&nbsp; action but P2,280 per annum only; admits those alleged in paragraph&nbsp; 2, 8. and 4 of the second cause of action but states that the entity or entities that employed&nbsp; the plaintiff before his suspension were distinct from the NARIC,; denies specifically those pleaded in paragraph 5 of the second cause of action concerning vacation and sick leave; admits the&nbsp; allegations in paragraph&nbsp; 2 of the third&nbsp; cause of action but alleges&nbsp; that plaintiff is&nbsp; not qualified or entitled to enjoy the benefits of Resolution No. 416 adopted by the board of directors of the NARIC mentioned in paragraph 2 of the third cause of action of the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; By&nbsp; way of special&nbsp; defenses,&nbsp; the NARIC alleges that aside from the criminal prosecution against the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; there was an. administrative investigation conducted against him&nbsp; and the investigating&nbsp; committee found him guilty of participation in the&nbsp; over issue&nbsp; of&nbsp; sacks under his charge and&nbsp; that his suspension was predicated on the findings of the investigating committee and not on the criminal case brought against him; that section 260 of the Revised Administrative Code is not applicable to the defendant because it is not a bureau qr office and its officers&nbsp; and employees do not come under the civil service rules; that under its charter&nbsp; the&nbsp; NARIC by&nbsp; its&nbsp; board&nbsp; of&nbsp; directors is&nbsp; empowered to prescribe its own rules and regulations for the removal and compensation of its employees different from those that govern employees under the civil service rules; that&nbsp; Resolution No; 416 referred to in paragraph 2 of the third; cause&nbsp; of action of the complaint cannot be availed of by&nbsp; the plaintiff;&nbsp; that under the law at the time the plaintiff was separated from the service unused vacation and sick leave were forfeited in favor of the Government; and that Republic Act No, 611 which&nbsp; authorizes the commutation&nbsp; of&nbsp; vacation&nbsp; and sick leave approved on 5&nbsp; May 1952 (1951) cannot be&nbsp; availed of by the plaintiff because the act hag no retroactive effect.<br><br>A motion to dismiss was filed by the defendant Alfredo Montelibano&nbsp; as Secretary of&nbsp; Economic&nbsp; Coordination and acted upon favorably by the Court dismissing the complaint as to him in&nbsp; his official capacity.<br><br>On&nbsp; the date set for hearing, the parties&nbsp; entered into the following stipulation of facts:<br><ol type="1">Come now the patties in the above entitled case&nbsp; assisted by the undersigned counsel and to this&nbsp; Honorable Court hereby&nbsp; stipulate (on) the following facts:<br><br><li>That herein complainant has been&nbsp; employed with the NARIC in 1936, date&nbsp; of organization,' continuously&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Japanese occupation&nbsp; on&nbsp; January 2, 1942 and was&nbsp; employed again on&nbsp; (its) organization on May 1946 up to June 1950;<br><br></li><li>That during these periods of. employment of the plaintiff&nbsp; he has to his credit sick and vacation leave of 77.416 days;<br><br></li><li>(That) on June 1950,&nbsp; plaintiff was&nbsp; suspended as warehouseman at warehouse Ho. 9-B,&nbsp; The suspension order&nbsp; was signed&nbsp; by Mr. V.

If that is the case, there is no valid&nbsp; reason for holding that the&nbsp; officers and employees of a government institution, organization&nbsp; or agency entrusted with part of the governmental functions do&nbsp; not&nbsp; fall under the&nbsp; protection afforded&nbsp; by&nbsp; the civil service rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; To bring&nbsp; about honesty and efficiency of officers and employees of such institutions,&nbsp; organizations or agencies&nbsp; a climatic condition should be created to make them feel secure in the enjoyment of their office or employment in the same way as all other&nbsp; officers&nbsp; and employees of the government are safeguarded&nbsp; in the tenure&nbsp; of their office&nbsp; or&nbsp; employment. That safeguard, guarantee,&nbsp; or feeling of security that they would hold their office or employment during good behavior and would not be dismissed without justifiable&nbsp; cause to be determined in&nbsp; an investigation, where an opportunity to be heard and defend themselves in person or by counsel is afforded them, would bring about such a desirable' condition.&nbsp; To do away with it would lead to inefficiency and most likely to dishonesty on the part of the officers and employees and abuse on the part of the board of directors.<br><br>Republic Act&nbsp; No. 663 invoked by the trial court was approved on 16 June 1951.&nbsp; It cannot be made retroactive and to&nbsp; apply to&nbsp; the plaintiff who&nbsp; was&nbsp; suspended on 30 June 1950.&nbsp; But even if the provisions of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 663, invoked by the trial court, were&nbsp; to be applied, still the plaintiff as warehouseman of the defendant cannot be&nbsp; suspended&nbsp; or removed from&nbsp; employment without an investigation and&nbsp; a finding that a. sufficient cause exists' to suspend or remove him.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 6(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of Republic Act No. 663 does not and cannot authorize the board of directors of the defendant to remove any officer or employee of the corporation without cause,&nbsp; for the authority of the board of directors to prescribe its own rules and regulations, etc. for the removal of officers and employees of the defendant was not and could' not have&nbsp; been intended to clothe the corporation with despotic and tyrannic power&nbsp; of removal of its officers or employees at its whim and caprice.&nbsp; A power granted to the board of directors such as that claimed by the corporation would not be conducive to good government but would tend to create abject&nbsp; and slavish officers and employees.<br><br>While the suspension of the plaintiff upon information received by the&nbsp; Assistant General&nbsp; Manager of the defendant that there was an overissue&nbsp; of sacks in the plaintiff's custody as warehouseman was justified, his separation from the service, which was&nbsp; actually done because he has never been reinstated&nbsp; and his request for&nbsp; reinstatement and&nbsp; demand for payment of back salaries&nbsp; during his suspension&nbsp; was denied,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]&nbsp;</span></sup> is unlawful, because lie was acquitted&nbsp; by the court of malversation with which he&nbsp; was charged<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> and such acquittal would entitle him to reinstatement and payment of back unpaid salaries.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup>&nbsp; If, as alleged and claimed by the defendant, his separation was the result of the recommendation of a committee that conducted an inquiry into the charges against him for over issue of sacks, and&nbsp; not of criminal charges brought against him, such inquiry and recommendation is of no legal effect, because although the defendant claims that the plaintiff was notified of such investigation and to be present and defend himself, nevertheless the stipulation of facts states that "the herein plaintiff was not able to appear and defend himself, because he did not&nbsp; receive&nbsp; any notice to appear in the Administrative&nbsp; Investigation."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Paragraph 4 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; stipulation of facts.)&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; although&nbsp; in the&nbsp; unsigned report on&nbsp; the investigation attached to the stipulation of facts (Exhibit 1-NARIC), the plaintiff's dismissal from the&nbsp; service was recommended,&nbsp; still&nbsp; such report cannot be made the basis of the plaintiff's dismissal from the service, because according to the stipulation of facts he did not receive any notice to appear in the investigation and for that reason did not appear&nbsp; thereat to defend himself.<br><br>For lack of evidence the prayer for moral and exemplary damages cannot be granted.<br><br>The prayer of the&nbsp; petition is in the alternative.&nbsp; So, if the plaintiff is reinstated to his former employment&nbsp; as warehouseman and paid&nbsp; his back unpaid salaries during the period from the date of his suspension to that of his reinstatement,&nbsp; the prayer for sick&nbsp; and vacation leave of five months and severance&nbsp; pay pursuant to NARIC Resolution No. 416 need not&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted. There is&nbsp; no showing that the plaintiff cannot be reinstated.<br><br>Conformably thereto, the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from is reversed; and the NARIC&nbsp; is&nbsp; directed&nbsp; to reinstate&nbsp; the plaintiff to his employment as warehouseman and to pay him his back unpaid salaries&nbsp; during his suspension from 30 June 1950 to the date of his reinstatement.&nbsp; No costs shall be taxed. <br><br><i>Parás, C.
