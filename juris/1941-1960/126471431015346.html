				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is  a  petition by way  of certiorari  to revise  a decision of the Court  of Appeals reversing  the decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao dated April 18, 1952, dismissing Civil Case No-458 of that Court, on the ground that  the same should be filed against the judicial administrator of the estate of  Pascual Libudan, and declaring the estate of the late  Jose  L.  Palma Gil  owner of the land described in the complaint and ordering defendant-appellee to  vacate  it  and surrender possession thereof to judicial administrator  Emilio Palma  Gil.   Pertinent to this case are the following facts found  by the  Court  of Appeals in its  appealed  decision.</p>
<p>On February 21, 1950, Gregoria Vda.  de Palma  Gil,  as administratrix of the estate of  her deceased husband Jose L. Palma  Gil,  later substituted by Emilio Palma Gil,  as administrator of the same estate, commenced the present action in the Court of First Instance  of Davao to recover possession  and  ownership of  a parcel of land  located  in Babao, Samal, Davao, with an  area of 31,040 square meters, against Palinkud Samal,  widow of Pascual Lubudan and four other defendants.  The principal defendant is Palinkud Samal because her co-defendants disclaim ownership or interest in the property in  litigation, which may be the reason  why  Palinkud  is the only one  prosecuting this appeal for the decision of the Court  of Appeals.</p>
<p>In Civil Case No. 204 entitled "Jose Palma Gil <em>vs</em>. Pascual Libudan, et al.," of the Justice of the Peace Court of Samal, to satisfy the judgment obtained by plaintiff Palma Gil, the parcel of land in question was sold at public auction by  the  Acting  Provincial Sheriff  of Davao to plaintiff Palma Gil himself on December  27, 1940.  The land was supposedly the property of Pascual Libudan, one of the defendant in  the said case.   Because of  his  failure to redeem  the property the  Sheriff issued the final  deed of sale in favor of Jose Palma Gil sometime in December 1943, and possession thereof  was delivered to  him through his representative, said  final  deed of sale being recorded in the office of the Register  of Deeds of Davao.   Palma Gil died in  December 1944, and the  herein defendants taking advantage of his death and of the chaotic conditions therein obtaining just after  the last Pacific war, illegally entered the land in question and gathered the coconut fruits therein. Pascual  Libudan died in   1946.</p>
<p>At the trial,  the  defense tried to prove that the land in question was  covered by  two free patent applications approved by the Director  of Lands way  back in  1934 in favor of Pascual Libudan  and one  Estanislao Malise (Samal).  The trouble according to the  Court of Appeals is that the  defense did  not present any  oral evidence to identify the land said to be covered by said two free  patent applications to establish their relation,  if any, to the land in question.  The Court of Appeals further found that as a result of the application  for registration filed by Pascual Libudan in Registration Case No.  281, G.L.R.O.  Receipt No. 51986,  the  Court  of  First Instance  of Davao  in an order dated September 7, 1940, decreed the registration and issuance of a title in the name of said Pascual Libudan over a  parcel  of land, which judging from the boundary owners indicated in the Surveyor's plan, is the same parcel now in litigation; that although as already stated, this land was sold to Palma Gil by the Acting Provincial Sheriff in the execution sale in 1940 and the final sale was  issued to  him in 1943, followed by  the delivery  of possession, Pascual Libudan up  to his death in 1946,  did not contest the regularity or validity of the execution sale nor did his heirs do so up to the filing of the  complaint in this case. From all  this, it is clear that regardless of the claims of the defense that Pascual  Libudan  and Estanislao  Malise (Samal) had  filed free patent applications later approved by the  Director of Lands in 1934, the fact is  that the land in question was  decreed and registered in the name of Pascual Libudan in the Court of First Instance of Davao in  September 1940,  and it was sold in December of'the same year as  his property by the Acting Provincial Sheriff to  Jose Palma Gil, the final certificate of sale having been issued in 1943, followed by the delivery of possession to Jose Palma Gil.  It is also clear that the defendants herein, particularly Palinkud Samal, had no right to enter the land in  1945 because all rights and interest thereto of Pascual Libudan had  been legally transferred to Jose Palma Gil.</p>
<p>Now, as regards the  question of procedure, as already said, the trial court in a decision dismissed the complaint without prejudice to filing a new suit against the administrator of the estate of Pascual Libudan.  In reversing said decision,  the Court of Appeals held that there was no  need of filing an  action against  said administrator because at the commencement of the present action in 1950, the estate of  Pascual Libudan no  longer  had any right or  interest in the property.  Ordinarily, when an order of dismissal issued by the trial  court  is reversed on appeal, the case is remanded to said trial court for further proceedings, particularly for the reception of evidence.  In the present case, however, the trial court had already received all  the  evidence  presented  by both parties,  consequently, the Court of Appeals was in a position to pass upon as it did said evidence and decide the case on (its merits, and there was no  necessity for remanding the case.</p>
<p>Finding the decision of the Court of Appeals to  be  in conformity with its findings of fact and in accordance with law, the same is hereby affirmed.  No costs.</p>
