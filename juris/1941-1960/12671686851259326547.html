				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The six defendants Salvador Diama, Sofronio Gajo, Julio Nono, 
Conrado Galapin, Romeo Ambid and Emeterio Zarate were charged in the Court of 
First Instance of Iloilo with triple murder for killing Esperanza Garganera de 
Nograles and her two sons, Romeo and Agusto, both surnamed Nograles. All of them 
were, at the beginning, tried together but after the prosecution had rested its 
case, said defendants on October 10, 1946, moved for the suspension of the trial 
to enable them to submit their case before the Tenth Guerrilla Amnesty 
Commission, which motion was granted. By resolution promulgated on May 6, 1947, 
the said Amnesty Commission denied the petition for amnesty filed by the 
accused. Upon resumption of the trial however, defendants Ambid and Zarate asked 
for and were granted a separate trial with the understanding that the evidence 
already presented by the Government will be considered against all of them, and 
that the separate trial will be held only with respect to the presentation of 
evidence for the defense. After the termination of the hearing, one decision was 
rendered as regards Diama, Gajo, Nono, and Galapin, finding them guilty of 
triple murder, the first three as co-principals and Galapin as accomplice and 
sentencing the first three to life imprisonment with the accessories of the law 
and to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of each of the deceased in the 
sum of P1,800, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and 
Galapin to an indeterminate penalty of from ten (10) years of <i>prision 
mayor</i>, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of 
<i>reclusion temporal,</i> as maximum, with the accessories of the law, and to 
indemnify the heirs of each of the deceased in the sum of P200, and all four to 
pay each one-sixth (1/6) of the costs. In another decision Ambid and Zarate were 
found guilty as principals of triple murder and sentenced each to suffer the 
penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with the accessory penalties of the law; 
to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of each of the deceased in the sum 
of P1,800, and each to pay one-sixth (1/6) of the costs.
<p align="justify">All the six accused appealed to the Court of Appeals, which 
court subsequently by resolution sent the case up to the Supreme Court because 
of the nature of the penalty imposed on the five defendants convicted as 
principals. Appellants Diama, Gajo, Nono, and Galapin reiterate their claim for 
amnesty in their brief, while Ambid and Zarate in a separate brief insist in 
their defense of duress. After the filing of the brief for the Government, the 
law firm Sotto &amp; Sotto filed its appearance as counsel for all the accused 
in collaboration with the defense counsel and in a memorandum which it was 
allowed by the Court to file, the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation issued by 
President Roxas on September 7, 1946, was invoked for all the six 
appellants.</p>
<p align="justify">The facts in this case which are either not subject to dispute 
or are amply established by evidence may be briefly stated as follows: In and 
prior to September, 1944, the six appellants were members of a guerrilla force 
in the island of Panay under the Command of Colonel Peralta and were attached to 
the Chaplain Service under Capt. Macario Ga. Diama was a corporal while his five 
co-dendants, all under his command were privates, Zoilo Garganera, although a 
companion and member of the same unit, was not a regular guerrilla soldier but a 
mere camp follower. Before September, 1944, this unit of the appellants had its 
command post at Madarag, on the mainland of Panay, midway between the towns of 
Lambunao and Janiuay, Province of Iloilo. About two weeks before September 18, 
1944 the appellants and Zoilo Garganera crossed over to the island of Guimaras 
and established a forward command post at sitio Bankiling, in the barrio of 
Suclaran, municipality of Buenavista, for the purpose of gathering food supplies 
for the guerrillas on the mainland of Panay.</p>
<p align="justify">Esperanza Garganera de Nograles, her two sons, Romeo and 
Agusto, her daughter Estela and the latter's husband, Claro Binaje had been 
living in the Japanese Garrison area in the barrio of Sto. Rosario in the same 
municipality of Buenavista. After the first American bombing of Iloilo, they 
left said barrio of Sto. Rosario which was no longer safe as a residence having 
become a military objective, and transferred to barrio Suclaran, arriving there 
on September 17, 1944, In the afternoon of September 18, Corporal Diama summoned 
his five co-defendants, Gajo, Nono, Galapin, Ambid, and Zarate, including Zoilo 
Garganera and told them to get ready for they were going out on a mission, but 
without informing them of the nature thereof. He issued arms to his menâ€”Gajo, 
Ambid and Zarate, a bolo each; Galapin, a .32 pistol; Nono, a double-barreled 
shotgun: and Garganera, another shotgun, while and he (Diama) carried a .38 
revolver, and they started for that part of the barrio of Suclaran, where the 
Nograles family as previously stated had transferred their residence from barrio 
Sto. Rosario. After some delay, in the course of their march and when nearing 
the house of Esperanza Garganera de Nograles, Diama asked his men if they knew 
whom they were going to arrest and when they expressed their ignorance thereof, 
turning to Zoilo Garganera, he said: "Zoilo, don't get offended because we are 
going to arrest your aunt Esperanza and her two sons." According to the evidence 
for the prosecution, Zoilo protested, saying that those persons were guiltless, 
but Diama answered saying that he had to carry out superior orders from Capt. 
Ga. According to the evidence for the defense, however, Zoilo instead of 
protesting, heartily approved of the idea of arresting his aunt and her two sons 
because they were really Japanese spies.</p>
<p align="justify">On reaching the house of the Nograles family, by order of 
Corporal Diama, his companions surrounded the house while Zarate going up the 
house, repeatedly called Esperanza in a loud voice and on being admitted, he 
explained to her that she and her two sons were wanted for investigation by an 
officer who was waiting at the beach several hundred meters away. Obeying the 
summons, Esperanza and her two sons, Romeo and Agusto, went down the house and 
were conducted by Corporal Diama and his men toward the beach. Esperanza carried 
a lamp to light their way but soon the light of tfeis lamp was extinguished or 
was blown out by the wind and, presumably, as a measure of precaution, Diama 
ordered the hands of Romeo and Agusto to be tied behind their backs, which was 
done. When nearing the beach, Diama told his men that he would investigate the 
three prisoners one by one at the beach and he actually proceeded to take Agusto 
with him to the shore for investigation, but the three prisoners expressed their 
desire to be investigated together and all at the same time. Then, Diama told 
his men that it was better to kill the three prisoners because they were really 
Japanese spies and upon hearing this suggestion or command, his men acted 
immediately. Gajo boloed Esperanza and then Agusto. Esperanza was felled by the 
blow but Agusto, though wounded, ran toward the water's edge, Diama shouted to 
his men that none of the prisoners should be allowed to escape. Zarate pursued 
Agusto and finished him with his bolo. Nono and Ambid went after Romeo who was 
running away. Ambid boloed him but as he continued to run Nono shot him down 
with his shotgun. The bodies of Esperanza, Romeo and Agusto were placed side by 
side on the beach. By order of Diama, Zoilo and Galapln secured a boat and Gajo 
and Zarate placing the bodies in it, rowed out to deep water and there dumped 
them. The following day, the three bodies were found near the shore where they 
had been evidently washed up by the waves.</p>
<p align="justify">After a careful and comprehensive review of the evidence, our 
view and conclusion is that this whole case of the six appellants can and should 
be decided on the sole issue of amnesty invoked by them. It should be stated 
that although the evidence with regard to the actual killing of the three 
deceased as well as the participation in it of the appellants herein is more or 
less clear, the evidence as to the events preceding said killing, particularly 
the reason therefor, is highly conflicting, the conflict, lying not only as 
between the testimonies of witnesses for the prosecution on one side and those 
of the defense on the other but in the evidence for the defense itself. For 
Instance, there is evidence for the prosecution to the effect that prior to 
July, 1943, there was a dispute over a land boundary between Captain Ga and Leon 
Nograles, father of Romeo and Agusto, which led to a quarrel on July 29, 1943, 
but which ended in a temporary settlement or understanding that neither of the 
parties will work on the land under dispute until the courts could decide the 
title thereto. In August, 1943, Leon Nograles was captured by the Japanese 
forces and was taken to the house of Captain Ga, where he was investigated. The 
mother, a brother, and a sister-in-law of Captain Ga were also arrested by the 
Japanese and investigated. They were later killed while Leon Nograles was 
released. In January, 1944, an unknown person shot at Leon Nograles but did not 
hit him. However sometime later in ithe same month, a second attempt was made 
upon the life of Leon Nograles and he was killed. Another piece of evidence for 
the prosecution is to the effect that sometime in September, 1944, the two 
brothers Romeo and Agusto Nograles told Emilio Garganera, a cousin of their 
mother Esperanza that they knew that it was Capt. Ga who was responsible for the 
death of their father and that they would avenge his death that Emilio who was a 
member of the Chaplain Service under Capt. Ga immediately warned the latter to 
be on his guard. All this evidence was obviously intended to show that the 
decision and order to liquidate Esperanza and her two sons came from Capt. Ga; 
that he had ordered Corporal Diama and his men to arrest and later kill the 
three deceased not because they were Japanese spies as contended by the defense 
but due to purely personal motives, either because he suspected that Leon 
Nograles, the father of Agusto and Romeo, was responsible for the death of his 
mother, brother and a sister-in-law, or as a precautionary measure to forestall 
the possibility of the two brothers carrying out their plan of revenge and 
reprissal. This theory is in some measure supported by the testimony of Ambid 
and Zarate in their separate trial that in the morning of September 18, 1944, 
they were present at a conference between Capt. Ga, Corporal Diama and Zoilo 
Garganera in the course of which, Zoilo told Capt. Ga that his aunt Esperanza 
and cousins Romeo and Agusto had planned and instigated his (Zoilo's) arrest by 
the Japanese and so he wanted the Captain to have these people arrested because 
they were Japanese spies, and that Capt. Ga had instructed Corporal Diama 
together with his men to arrest Esperanza and her two sons and investigate them 
if they were really Japanese spies.</p>
<p align="justify">In a well prepared brief for the Government, the Solicitor 
General after analyzing the evidence, came to the conclusion that the six 
appellants come within the terms of the amnesty grant. Bearing in mind that the 
Amnesty Commission had previously denied the appellants' petition for amnesty, 
and that the trial court had equally declined to extend to them the benefits of 
said amnesty proclamation, believing that the liquidation of the deceased was 
motivated by personal motives, we took special pains and care in examining and 
scrutinizing the evidence on this point. After said scrutiny, we are inclined to 
agree with the Solicitor General that the appellants herein if not clearly 
entitled to the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation should at least be given 
the benefit, of the doubt and should be freed from the charge of triple 
murder.</p>
<p align="justify">Assuming for a moment as correct the theory of the prosecution, 
which we are not prepared to accept, that Capt. Ga had issued the order for the 
arrest and killing of the three deceased because of his belief that Leon 
Nograles was responsible for the death of his mother, brother and sister-in-law, 
there is reason to believe that Esperanza and her two sons were really Japanese 
spies and had on several occasions helped the enemy not only in getting food 
supplies but also in rounding up, torturing, and otherwise harrassing guerrilla 
members and guerrilla suspects, and what is more, that Capt. Ga knew and 
believed all this. In such a case, there would be mixed motives for the killing, 
namely, in furtherance of the resistance movement as well as personal, in which 
case, the appellants would still come under the benefits of the Amnesty 
Proclamation which excludes from its benefits crimes committed from purely 
personal motives. In the second place, in carrying out the order of Capt. Ga for 
the arrest and liquidation of Esperanza and her two sons, it is hardly Just that 
appellants herein be hold answerable for the alleged personal motives of Capt. 
Ga. The captain was their superior officerÂ» They were not supposed to be aware 
of his personal motives. If he told them that a certain party or parties were to 
be killed because of their pro-Japanese connections and spying activities, it 
was not for them to investigate and decide whether any personal motive of their 
officer was involved. It was enough, under a liberal interpretation of the 
provisions of the Amnesty Proclamation, and their application, that the order 
given was ostensibly based on the Nograles family being Japanese spies, and what 
is more important, that the appellants, before carrying out the order, had 
received information from various sources and believed said information totiie 
effect that Esperanza and her two sons were really aiding the Japanese, From an 
analysis of the evidence there is strong reason for the belief that Cpl. Diama 
and his co-defendants had been reliably informed when they crossed over to the 
island of Guimaras and during their stay there prior to September 18, 1944, that 
Esperanza and her two sons were really Japanese spies and that their presence in 
the same barrio of Suclaran where they had evacuated from the barrio of Sto. 
Rosario would be a constant menace not only to the success of the mission of 
Diama and his men in gathering supplies but also to their very lives.</p>
<p align="justify">For instance, there is evidence introduced for tte defense to 
the effect that beginning January, 1944, Esperanza Garganera and her chidren 
resided within the Japanese Garrison area at barrio Sto. Rosario; that during 
the Japanese occupation, those Filipinos living within the protection of the 
Japanese Garrison area were considered traitors by the Filipinos living outside, 
and that some of the former were sometimes killed by the guerrillas on mere 
suspicion that they were pro-Japanese merely because they were living within the 
Garrison area. During their residence in Sto. Rosario, the members of the 
Nograles family were on friendly terms with Japanese soldiers and officers, 
often seen in their company, entertaining them in their house and giving them 
food specially rice. At a fiesta in January, 1944, a daughter of Esperanza 
Garganera was elected and crowned muse with the help of Capt. Hamamoto, who 
later in April, acted as one of the sponsors at the marriage of Estela, another 
daughter of Esperanza, Romeo and Agusto sometimes rounded up laborers to dig 
trenches for the Japanese forces and they acted as foremen of those laborers. 
These two brothers in conversation with some Filipinos, discoursed on the 
futility of further resistance to the Japanese, telling them that the Americans 
will never come back, Romeo and Agusto used to accompany Japanese soldiers in 
boats to intercept guerrillas crossing the strait between Guimaras island and 
the mainland and on one or two oocasions, helped Japanese forces capture 
guerrilla soldiers.</p>
<p align="justify">On one occasion Esperanza at the suggestion of her son Agusto, 
went to the Japanese garrison to transmit information received from her cousin 
Luis Garganera regarding the presence of guerrilla soldiers in the barrio of San 
Roque. Acting upon this information the Japanese forces sent a punitive 
expedition to barrio San Roque. On another occasion, Esperanza and her cousin 
Luis Garganera reported to the Japanese garrison commander that one, Sotero 
Goles, was supporting guerrillas in barrio Suclaran, later Goles and his family 
were arrested by the Japanese. According to the testimony of Estanislao Ferrer, 
Japanese soldiers accompanied by Romeo and Agusto and some members of the 
Japanese sponsored Coastal Defense Corps (CDC) conducted a raid in barrio 
Taminla. On that occasion, Agusto beat up a soldier named Bartolonie Casirairo 
who, together with others was later killed. With the aid of the Nograles 
brothers the Japanese set fire to the houses in the same barrio. This same 62 
year old witness Estanislao Ferrer according to him had testified before the War 
Crimes Commission in Manila to the same effect relative to the raid conducted in 
barrio Taminla. There is also evidence to the effect that Filipino forces 
engaged in the resistance movement used to receive information from various 
agents regarding the traitorous activities of the Nograles family.</p>
<p align="justify">It is of course possible that as already stated, Esperanza and 
her two sons were killed by order of Capt. Ga due to purely personal motives. It 
is equally possible, however, that assuming that the order originated from Capt. 
Ga, that along with his personal motives he also had his belief based on reports 
received from the men under him and from persons who came to know the 
pro-Japanese activities of the deceased, that they were Japanese spies. It is 
also possible if not probable that Capt. Ga had nothing to do with the plan to 
kill Esperanza and her two sons and that it was Corporal Diama and his men who, 
after crossing over to Guimaras island and during their two weeks stay there 
while gathering supplies and making observations as to the activities of the 
enemy had become convinced of the traitorous of the deceased and so took it upon 
themselves to liquidate them not only as a measure of punishment but also for 
the protection of the guerrillas in the barrio of Suolaran. In this connection, 
it is significant to note that prior to the actual killing of the three 
deceased, Corporal Diama had signified his intention to investigate the three 
prisoners and actually began questioning Esperanza at the beach, and that he 
later issued the fatal order saying it was better to kill the prisoners because 
they were Japanese spies. And, according to three of the accused, Diama ordered 
the killing only after Zoilo Garganera had whispered to him that Romeo and 
Agusto were trying to escape.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, in case of doubt the same should be resolved in favor 
of those invoking the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation, Administrative Order 
No. 11 issued by President Roxas on October 2, 1946, creating the Guerrilla 
Amnesty Commission, particularly that portion referring to the manner the 
amnesty commissions were to study and decide the cases set before them, contains 
this admonition and advice: "any reasonable doubt as to whether a given case 
falls within the proclamation shall be resolved in favor of the accused," (Adm. 
Order No, 11, 40 Off. Gaz., 2360, October, 1946).</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing and considering the recommendation of 
the Solicitor General, and on the basis of our review of the evidence in this 
case, we hereby find and declare that the appellants herein are entitled to the 
benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation, and reversing the decision appealed from, 
the information filed in this case is hereby dismissed, with the costs of this 
instance, <i>de oficio</i>. The defendants and appellants will be set free 
immediately. So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Tuason,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
