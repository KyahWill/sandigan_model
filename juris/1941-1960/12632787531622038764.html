				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These&nbsp; are two criminal cases coining up from Batangas (Nos. 1061 and 1062).&nbsp; In the first, Ildefonso Palo and his&nbsp; brother&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; were&nbsp; accused of&nbsp; murdering: Candido Catapang, their own brother-in-law.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the second, Ildefonso was charged with illegal&nbsp; possession of the gun with which the victim had been shot.&nbsp; After a joint trial,&nbsp; the defendants were found guilty as charged.&nbsp; Wherefore the Court sentenced each&nbsp; of&nbsp; them, in the first&nbsp; case, to&nbsp; life imprisonment with accessories,&nbsp; and to indemnify the heirs in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P6,000,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs;&nbsp; and in the second, Ildefonso was given one year&nbsp; and one day to two years and one&nbsp; day of imprisonment, plus&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The firearm and the&nbsp; ammunition were confiscated.<br><br>In the afternoon of June 20, 1954 Candido Catapang went to&nbsp; the river&nbsp; of barrio Apakay, Taal, Batangas, to get some water.&nbsp; There he met and talked with his brother- in-law Juanito Palo.&nbsp; Apparently&nbsp; they had some sharp disagreement, because&nbsp; Candido was heard to demand&nbsp; angrily "Why don't you heed my request?&nbsp;&nbsp; As it happened that Candido's daughter, Angeles, was in the river washing some clothes,&nbsp; and overheard the&nbsp; altercation, she became alarmed and hurriedly called Santiago de Roxas, who was then drilling an artesian well nearby&nbsp; together with Marcelino Araga and Jose Navarro.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resenting his daughter's act, Candido reprimanded her and chased her home with a piece of wood.&nbsp; At that moment&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; de&nbsp; Roxas and Navarro arrived in time to hear the detonation of a firearm, the&nbsp; bullet whizzing&nbsp; by.&nbsp; They looked&nbsp; around&nbsp; but&nbsp; saw nobody.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then another shot rang out.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time Candido Catapang was hit in the abdomen.&nbsp; Forthwith Ildefonso Palo emerged&nbsp; from behind some big boulders, holding the pistol Exhibit A, even as Pedro Palo, armed with&nbsp; a bolo sallied forth to slash&nbsp; Candido&nbsp; Catapang"&nbsp; across the face. The victim fell down helpless; he was&nbsp; immediately brought to the Provincial Hospital,&nbsp; but&nbsp; he died on the way.<br><br>The foregoing is&nbsp; the firsthand account given&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Batangas&nbsp; court&nbsp; by Angeles&nbsp; Catapang, Santiago de Roxas and Jose Navarro.&nbsp; Angeles admittedly witnessed the whole affair. The defense implies her presence, and that of Santiago de&nbsp; Roxas to whom Ildefonso Palo&nbsp; surrendered the gun right after the killing, inasmuch as he was the barrio lieutenant.<br><br>The defense however&nbsp; insists&nbsp; that&nbsp; "the incident arose when one&nbsp; of the defendants demonstrated with the deceased while the&nbsp; latter (then under the&nbsp; influence of liquor)&nbsp; was beating his daughter,&nbsp; niece of said defendants with deadly weapons, and in the struggle that ensued the deceased was killed with his own weapon that was wrested from him by the defendant&nbsp; (Ildefonso)."&nbsp;&nbsp; Pedro, it is claimed, "was in no&nbsp; way concerned with&nbsp; that struggle".<br><br>According to&nbsp; its witnesses Juanito Palo,&nbsp; Ireneo&nbsp; Maristela, Ramon Banaag and the&nbsp; two defendants, when Candido was&nbsp; chasing his daughter with&nbsp; bolo&nbsp; in&nbsp; hand, Ildefonso arrived and told Candido to stop; but the latter,&nbsp; taking offense at the&nbsp; interference, returned his bolo to the scabbard, drew his pistol and&nbsp; saying "I&nbsp; will kill&nbsp; you&nbsp; all" lunged at Ildefonso, who grabbed Candido's hand, managed&nbsp; to&nbsp; wrest&nbsp; the&nbsp; firearm and ran&nbsp; away pursued&nbsp; by Candido&nbsp; who&nbsp; meantime&nbsp; unsheated his&nbsp; bolo.&nbsp; However as his escape was blocked by a&nbsp; fence&nbsp; and&nbsp; some&nbsp; animals, Ildefonso turned around and&nbsp; fire&nbsp; a&nbsp; warning shot.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Candido&nbsp; kept advancing, Ildefonso fired&nbsp; again,&nbsp; and the bullet hit its&nbsp; mark.&nbsp;&nbsp; But Candido continued advancing, so Ildefonso—incredible as it seems—''transferred the gun to his left hand", drew his&nbsp; own bolo and hacked&nbsp; Candido on&nbsp; the&nbsp; face,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; latter&nbsp; came&nbsp; within&nbsp; striking distance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup><br><br>The trial judge who saw the witnesses testify refused to believe the defendants' version, for&nbsp; seven reasons, fully explained in his decision&nbsp; under review.&nbsp; Upon examination of the <i>expediente</i> we find them&nbsp; to be well-founded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most important is&nbsp; the improbability of such version.<br><br>"The Court does not&nbsp; believe" says&nbsp; the decision, "that the deceased would have attempted to kill&nbsp; Ildefonso&nbsp; and hi s brother Juanito just because they tried to prevent Candido&nbsp; from&nbsp; chastizing his own daughter.&nbsp; Nor, does the Court believe that, assuming it to be true that Candido wanted&nbsp; to attack&nbsp; Ildefonso he&nbsp; would&nbsp; have returned&nbsp; his bolo in&nbsp; its&nbsp; scabbard, and&nbsp; draw&nbsp; a pistol&nbsp; instead, considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; Ildefonso&nbsp; was not&nbsp; armed; nor, after Ildefonso had wrested the&nbsp; pistol from Candido, would Candido still pursue&nbsp; Ildefonso&nbsp; who was&nbsp; already in the possession of the pistol&nbsp; To top it all, the Court considers it beyond comprehension that&nbsp; while Ildefonso was&nbsp; being allegedly pursued by Candido who refused to desist&nbsp; from his&nbsp; attack notwithstanding the 'fact that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was already&nbsp; fired at by a .45&nbsp; caliber pistol, Ildefonso would seek to strengthen his position by ceasing to use the&nbsp; pistol,&nbsp; transferring the same to&nbsp; his&nbsp; left hand,&nbsp; and drawing a&nbsp; bolo instead, in order to defend himself."<br><br>It should be noted that the day after the shooting, Ildefonso Palo voluntarily swore before the Justice of the Peace of Taal, Batangas, the&nbsp; affidavit Exhibit&nbsp; C corroborating the evidence of the prosecution above set&nbsp; out.&nbsp; And, what is most significant, therein he admitted ownership&nbsp; of the unlicensed pistol which&nbsp; killed&nbsp; Candido&nbsp; Catapang.<br><br>Obviously in line with this&nbsp; admission,&nbsp; defendants tried to settle' the&nbsp; case&nbsp; amicably by offering to pay P3,500.00 as indemnity to the heirs; but the deal failed to materialize. The defense presented&nbsp; no&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; that&nbsp; these&nbsp; efforts at settlement were made, not in acknowledgment of guilt, but to avoid the inconveniences of imprisonment or for&nbsp; other reasons consistent with defendants&nbsp; innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; Consequently the offer&nbsp; of compromise was&nbsp; properly considered as material evidence against the defendants.<br><br>The court also considered—quite correctly—that whereas the story&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution was supported by Santiago de Roxas and Jose Navarro who were not related&nbsp; to the deceased,&nbsp; the defendants'&nbsp; account&nbsp; rested&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; corroborative&nbsp; testimony of&nbsp; their&nbsp; brother&nbsp; Juanito&nbsp; Palo, his father-in-law Irineo Maristela and the uncle of Ildefonso's wife&nbsp; Ramon&nbsp; Banaag.<br><br>These remarks of course do not&nbsp; merely show preponderance&nbsp; of the prosecution's evidence;&nbsp; they mean that such evidence should be believed, because defendants' exculpation appears to be incredible.<br><br>Now then, does the State's proof establish beyond reasonable&nbsp; doubt the guilt of the&nbsp; accused?&nbsp; We are convinced that&nbsp; it does: there are disinterested&nbsp; eye-witnesses, there is an extrajudicial confession,&nbsp; and&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; corpus <i>delicti</i>; and the motive&nbsp; for the killing appeared to&nbsp; be the defendants' indignation&nbsp; at the deceased's zeal in upholding his brother's interest in the Iatter's property dispute with the Palos.<br><br>Murder was undoubtedly committed,&nbsp; qualified by treachery.&nbsp; It is said that voluntary&nbsp; surrender may mitigate defendants'&nbsp; offense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Ildefonso Palo handed the gun to the&nbsp; barrio lieutenant&nbsp; upon the latter's demand, there is no&nbsp; evidence that he&nbsp; willingly&nbsp; delivered himself to the authorities.&nbsp; On the contrary, Pedro&nbsp; Palo denied having voluntarily surrendered, alleging&nbsp; he had been taken from his house the following morning by some policemen. Anyway this mitigation is compensated by the aggravating circumstance of relationship, the deceased being brother-in-law of the offenders&nbsp; (Art. 15&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup><br><br>Therefore in the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of other modifying circumstances, life imprisonment was properly imposed upon these appellants.<br><br>In&nbsp; Criminal&nbsp; Case No. 1062&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no question that Ildefonso Palo had no government permit to possess the firearm with which he downed&nbsp; Candido Catapang.&nbsp; Hence he&nbsp; violated&nbsp; sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2692 of the Administrative&nbsp; Code&nbsp; as amended by Republic Act No. 4;&nbsp; and the prison&nbsp; term specified in the appealed decision lies within the limits fixed by said statute.<br><br>Wherefore the judgment under review is affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span>, with costs against appellants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
