				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
approving the taxation of costs in favor of defendant. The case was certified to 
this Court by the Court of Appeals for the reason that only a question of law is 
involved in this appeal.
<p>On March 11, 1948, plaintiff herein brought a civil action fin the Court of 
First Instance of Manila to recover damages alleged to have been caused by 
defendant to plaintiff in instituting a criminal action for estafa against 
plaintiff , which criminal action was dismissed. On July 13, 1948, he secured an 
order for the attachment of defendant's properties, filing a bond for the 
issuance of the said writ executed by the Plaridel Surety and Insurance Company, 
appellant in this proceeding. The properties of the defendant were attached, but 
upon defendant's presenting a counterbond, the order of attachment was lifted. 
The defendant then filed an answer containing a counterclaim for P15,000 as 
damages alleged to have been occasioned to him by the filing of the complaint 
and the attachment of his properties. He also asked for the attachment of the 
plaintiff's properties, which the court granted on April 6, 1949 and which was 
carried out by the sheriff. The defendant sought to have the properties attached 
sold but the petition was denied upon opposition of the plaintiff. The case was 
tried and on April 18, 1949 the court entered judgment dismissing the complaint 
on the ground that plaintiff has not proven his cause of action. Instead it 
allowed defendant to recover the following damages on his counterclaim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P125.55 as premium for the counterbond to lift the order of 
attachment;<br>P620.00 for payment of guards detailed by the Sheriff's 
Office;<br>P500.00 for attorney's fees; and<br>P5,000.00 for consequential 
damages for inability of defendant to use the transportation equipment 
attached.</p></blockquote>
<p>Against this judgment, the case was appealed by the plaintiff to the Court of 
Appeals and this Court affirmed the judgment dismissing the complaint but it 
modified the amount of damages that the defendant was allowed to recover on his 
counterclaim. The modification consisted in the elimination of the items of 
P125.55, P500.00 and P5,000, the last as consequential damages. When the 
judgment of the Court of Appeals became final and upon the case being returned 
to the Court of First Instance for the execution of the judgment, the clerk of 
court made a taxation of the costs, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"1. Sheriff's guards fees 
..................................................</td>
<td>
<div align="right">P7,840.00</div></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Premium on Bond for a Writ of Attachment</td>
<td>
<div align="right">205.75</div></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Other Sheriff's fees, as per receipts attached .... </td>
<td>
<div align="right">18.50</div></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<div align="center">Total.................................................................... 
</div></td>
<td>
<div align="right">P8,064.25</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>Opposition thereto was filed before the Court of First Instance, but this 
opposition was denied and the court approved the said taxation. So execution was 
issued and upon the return thereof unsatisfied in part, motion was presented 
against the Plaridel Surety and Insurance Company to compel it to pay the costs. 
The opposition is based on two grounds, namely, that the bondsman is not liable 
for the satisfaction of the judgment or any deficiency thereof, and that its 
bond is not answerable for the levying of the attachment by the defendant of 
plaintiff's properties. The court overruled this opposition, holding that the 
judgment of the Court of Appeals awarding costs to the defendant, and the 
sheriff's fees for services during the attachment of the plaintiff's properties 
are recoverable as part of such costs, citing in support thereof the case of 
Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. <em>vs</em>. Bernabe and Ferrer, 67 Phil. 658.</p>
<p>The above facts present for our consideration this legal question: Is 
plaintiff's bond on attachment liable for the sheriff's fees for guarding 
plaintiff's properties <em>attached by defendant</em> upon his counterclaim 
against the plaintiff? The claim of the surety on the bond, now appellant in 
this Court, is that the bond is not responsible therefor under Section 4 of Rule 
59, whereas the defendant contends that the said fees are recoverable as costs 
against the bond on attachment.</p>
<p>It is to be noted at the outset that the liability of the plaintiff for the 
costs taxed in this case is not in issue; what is in issue is the supposed 
liability of the plaintiff's attachment bond for said costs, after the execution 
therefor had been returned unsatisfied. The liability of the plaintiff's bond in 
attachment is defined in Section 4 of Rule 59, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The party applying for the order must give a bond executed to the defendant 
in an amount to be fixed by the judge, not exceeding the plaintiff's claim, that 
the plaintiff will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the defendant and 
all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall 
finally adjudge that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear from the above provision that the responsibility of the bondsman 
arises only "if the court shall finally adjudge that the plaintiff was not 
entitled thereto." According to Chief Justice Moran, the liability attaches if 
"the plaintiff is . not entitled to the attachment because <em>the requirements 
entitling him to the writ are wanting,</em>" or "if the plaintiff has no right 
to the attachment because <em>the facts stated in his affidavit, or some of 
them, are untrue</em>." (II Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952 ed., p. 
21). But there is no finding in the decision of the court <em>a quo</em>, or in 
that of the Court of Appeals, <em>that the plaintiff was not entitled to the 
attachment.</em> With out a finding to this effect, no liability can be imposed 
upon the bondsman, because his liability can not extend beyond that which the 
law has fixed for him. The court <em>a quo</em> evidently assumed that in case 
of costs, not damages, the bond is responsible if the party who furnished it is 
liable, but this is incorrect because the clause "if the court shall finally 
adjudge that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto," which is the foundation 
stone on which the bondsman's liability is based, applies both to damages and to 
costs.</p>
<p>The case of Macondray &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Bernabe and Ferrer, 
<em>supra</em>, cited by the court <em>a quo</em> as authority for ordering the 
execution against appellant bondsman, refers to the costs or expenses incurred 
by a plaintiff in enforcing his legitimate claim or credit against the 
defendant. The liability of a defendant for costs for all the processes that the 
plaintiff utilizes or avails of to enforce his legitimate claim or credit 
against defendant is justified. But the case cited is not applicable to the case 
at bar for the following reasons: In the first place, the costs in that case 
(Macondray &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Bernabe and Ferrer) were being enforced 
against the defendant himself, whereas in the case at bar, the payment of the 
costs is being enforced not against a party (plaintiff) but against his 
bondsman, whose responsibility is limited to the terms and conditions of the 
bond. In the second place, the issuance of the attachment writ in this case was 
not found by the court to have been unlawful or without cause; there is no 
finding of fact that plaintiff was not entitled to the attachment prayed 
for.</p>
<p>There is another reason why the bondsman, appellant in this case, can not be 
held responsible for costs sought to be enforced by execution of the bond. These 
costs represent the expenses that the defendant himself had incurred to enforce 
his counterclaim, which was dismissed. They were not costs sustained by the 
defendant <em>by reason of the attachment</em> within the meaning of Section 4 
of Rule 59, above-quoted. The phrase "by reason of the attachment" in this 
section applies to the costa as well as to the damages. This construction is 
supported by the punctuation. There is also no justification for making the 
bondsman on plaintiff's attachment responsible for the costs that may be awarded 
defendant, because such costs did not arise <em>by reason of the attachment 
obtained by plaintiff's bond</em>. When a surety on the attachment bond executes 
the bond therefor, he does not guarantee that the plaintiff's cause of action is 
meritorious and covenant that he will be responsible for all the costs adjudged 
against his principal in case the action fails. It is unreasonable to extend the 
responsibility that the bondsman has assumed to any and all costs arising in the 
proceedings, especially those not arising from the attachment secured by this 
bond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Liability on the bond is contractual in nature, and is ordinarily restricted 
to the obligations expressly assumed therein.</p>
<p>"Liability on an attachment bond is created by, and rests on, ita 
stipulations. The obligor has a right to stand on the very terms of his 
contract, and his liability will not be extended beyond the fair import of the 
words used; his liability is one not to be extended by implication, and it will 
not be inferred that he has agreed to do more than that which is fairly 
expressed in the bond; * * *." (7 CJS 342)</p></blockquote>
<p>His liability should be limited to those which arise by virtue or in 
connection with the attachment, and no more.</p>
<p>In connecton with the motion to dismiss the appeal, we note from the record 
that a similar one was presented to the Court of Appeals beore the briefs were 
filed and the jurisdiction of this Court of the case became apparent, and said 
court denied the same.</p>
<p>This denial is binding on us as it was made while the Court of Appeals still 
had jurisdiction of the case and the latter was pending therein.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, the order of execution against the 
appellant Plaridel Surety &amp; Insurance Company for the payment of the costs, 
subject of the appeal, is hereby reversed. With costs of the appeal against 
defendant-appellee Morton Meads.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Concepcion</em> and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order reversed.</em></p></div>
