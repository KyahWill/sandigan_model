				<H3>ANDRES G.  SANCHEZ, ET  AL.,  PETITIONERS,  VS.  NORTHERN LUZON TRANSPORTATION CO. INC., RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petition  for review  of the  decision  of the  Court of Appeals  dismissing  petitioners'  claim  for  one-month separation  pay from  their  employer  Northern Luzon Transportation Co., Inc.</p>
<p>Petitioners filed their claim, and won, in the La Union court  of first  instance.  There is no  question that  they were in the  employ  of respondent  prior  to  October  16, 1950.   On  that day,  they  lost  their  jobs allegedly in pursuance  of  advance  notice  given by  the employer, of probable  discontinuance of their  work.</p>
<p>Upon appeal  by the employer, the  Court  of Appeals held: as they had  been employed  without a definite period and were  separated  from their  employment  in October 1950  when Art.  302  of  the  Code  of Commerce1  had already been  repealed  by the  Civil  Code, they  have no right  to the one-month pay  mentioned therein.</p>
<p>At any  rate, declared that Court, they were sufficiently notified in advance of  their dismissal because on August 18,  1950,  the employer gave them this notice:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In view  of the fact that our business at that end is continuously declining and consequently does not  warrant the continuance of our personnel, the Company may be forced to lay off all  of you indefinitely  till  such  time when the business will pick up  again and  guarantee  our  operations in  that terminal.</p>
  <p>This  memorandum will serve you  as an advance  notice of what the  Management  will  do in the near future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  their petition for review,  claimants maintain that the  Court  of  Appeals erred in overruling their monetary demands  on the  strength of  the notice,  which was  not touched upon in the decision of the court  of first instance nor in  the brief of the appellant.  Having some doubts about the  sufficiency of the above notice,  we prefer to decide the  case on  the basis of the repeal of Article 302 of  the  Code of Commerce.  It will be remembered that this Article—included in the rules on agency of the Code of  Commerce—was expressly repealed by the New Civil Code (Art. 2270), which took  effect on August  30, 1950. So  that when  these  employees  were  separated from their employment in October 1950, Art.  302 was <em>already repealed</em>.   It is  true that  on vJune  12,  1954,  Republic Act No. 1052, was approved  reinstating the employee's-right to one month's notice of the termination of his employment  or to one-month pay in  lieu of such notice; but the act  could  not  be  construed  retroactively  so  as to  affect separations  that had  taken place before its enactment.</p>
<p>In Gutierrez  <em>vs</em>. Bachrach  Motor Co., Inc., 105 Phil., 9, we held (four members  dissenting) that employees without any fixed period of  employment Kad no right to the <em>mesada</em> mentioned in Art.  302  of the Code of Commerce, if dismissed after the enactment of the Civil Code and before the approval of Republic Act No. 1052.</p>
<p>The decision under review is, therefore, affirmed, with costs.</p>
<em>Padilla, Bautista  Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Art. 302.—In cases in which the contract does not have a fixed period,  anyone  of the parties may terminate it  upon  giving one month advance notice thereof to the  other.
<p>The factor or shop clerk shall have a right,  in this case, to the  salary corresponding to said one  month.
