				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original&nbsp; petition for certiorari&nbsp; with preliminary&nbsp; injunction to secure the annulment of the order of the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations dated&nbsp; October&nbsp; 12, 1957,&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 129-V(7),&nbsp; the&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; part&nbsp; of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Chief of the Examining Division of this Court, or any of his assistants, is hereby directed to examine the payrolls, daily&nbsp; time&nbsp; records, and other pertinent documents&nbsp; of respondent company in order&nbsp; to determine&nbsp; whether any or all of the 51 claimants rendered&nbsp; service up to 5:00&nbsp; o'clock p.m.&nbsp; and&nbsp; were&nbsp; not compensated for the extra&nbsp; hours of work beyond their supposed working hours, from the year 1951&nbsp; up to&nbsp; the present&nbsp; or up to the date they&nbsp; became&nbsp; monthly salaried employees&nbsp; and&nbsp; if so, to compute the amount due them and&nbsp; submit a report&nbsp; for further disposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; For&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; simplifying&nbsp; the computation of the basic&nbsp; rate per hour,&nbsp; the&nbsp; suggested formula should be&nbsp; to divide the&nbsp; weekly pay (rate per day times 6 days) by 40&nbsp; hours."<br></blockquote>Following is a summary of the background of the case: On March 15, 1948, the National&nbsp; Textile Workers Union filed&nbsp; with the Court of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations a labor case, which was docketed as No. 129-V, involving among others controversy over minimum wage, vacation and sick leave, salary increases,&nbsp; social security,&nbsp; backpay, housing project, and payment of overtime.&nbsp; This was decided on November 5,&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; but the case was not terminated in view of&nbsp; the various incidents that&nbsp; ensued after the rendition of&nbsp; the award.&nbsp; One of&nbsp; them&nbsp; was the&nbsp; filing by the petitioning Union in August,&nbsp; 1956, of&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; on behalf&nbsp; of 51 other members headed by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Bonifacio R. de Luna, claiming&nbsp; compensation for work rendered from 4:00&nbsp; to&nbsp; 5:00&nbsp; p.m.&nbsp; on Mondays&nbsp; through Fridays,&nbsp; and from 2:00 to 5:00&nbsp; p.m. on Saturdays, or a total&nbsp; of eight hours per week, counted from the year 1951. This petition being the seventh incident in the&nbsp; case, was docketed as No. 129-V (7), involving as it did the same parties.&nbsp; In it&nbsp; these 51 members alleged that,&nbsp; having been assigned and/or detailed to office work in the administrative offices of the company&nbsp; as&nbsp; clerks,&nbsp; typists,&nbsp; stenographers, bookkeepers,&nbsp; accountants, etc., on a&nbsp; daily&nbsp; wage&nbsp; basis, the implied contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; employment was that&nbsp; their working&nbsp; hours are the same as those&nbsp; observed&nbsp; by the monthly-paid employees, i.e., from&nbsp; 8:00 to 12:00 in the morning&nbsp; and from 1:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon&nbsp; from Mondays through Fridays, and from&nbsp; 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturdays; that as a matter of fact, the company had been paying them compensation for these additional hours of service, but that in&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; payment&nbsp; for such additional&nbsp; work&nbsp; was stopped&nbsp; by&nbsp; the company,&nbsp; at the recommendation of its&nbsp; auditor, although&nbsp; they&nbsp; were required to&nbsp; continue working up to 5:00&nbsp; o'clock&nbsp; in the afternoons&nbsp; as usual.<br><br>On September&nbsp; 1st, 1956, the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Development Company&nbsp; moved&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; alleging that the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations had already lost&nbsp; its jurisdiction over the case by&nbsp; virtue&nbsp; of the passage of the Minimum Wage&nbsp; Law&nbsp; (R.&nbsp; A.&nbsp; 602) and of the Industrial Peace Act&nbsp; (R. A.&nbsp; 875); but&nbsp; the motion was denied on&nbsp; January&nbsp; 29th,&nbsp; 1957.&nbsp; On&nbsp; February 7,&nbsp; 1957, the company filed its answer&nbsp; reiterating&nbsp; its allegations in the motion to&nbsp; dismiss, and averred&nbsp; that&nbsp; the case was&nbsp; a proper subject of collective bargaining pursuant to Republic Act No. 875.&nbsp; On&nbsp; October 12th of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same year,&nbsp; the order&nbsp; subject of these proceedings was&nbsp; issued by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial&nbsp; Relations maintaining&nbsp; its jurisdiction and holding that the petition in&nbsp; question was merely an&nbsp; incident&nbsp; of&nbsp; the main&nbsp; case and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; 51 petitioning&nbsp; members were&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; their&nbsp; claim.&nbsp; It therefore directed its Examining Division to make the necessary&nbsp; computations&nbsp; of the&nbsp; amount due&nbsp; each and every one&nbsp; of them.&nbsp; Reconsideration&nbsp; of the order was sought, but was denied on November 21,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; by the court en bane; hence this present petition.<br><br>Petitioner National Development Company now contends that the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; had&nbsp; no&nbsp; power to&nbsp; make the&nbsp; award to&nbsp; the&nbsp; 51&nbsp; members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Union because,&nbsp; under the Industrial&nbsp; Peace Act and by&nbsp; virtue of the decisions of this&nbsp; Tribunal&nbsp; in the&nbsp; cases of Reyes vs. Tan, et al., 99&nbsp; Phil., 880; 52 Off. Gaz. No. 14, p. 6187, and PAFLU <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Tan, et aJ., 99 Phil., 854; 52 Off. Gaz. No. 13, p.&nbsp; 5836, the power of the Court of Industrial Relations is circumscribed only&nbsp; within&nbsp; the following cases:<br><blockquote>"(1) When the labor dispute&nbsp; affects&nbsp; an industry which is indispensable to the national interest&nbsp; and is so certified&nbsp; by the President to the industrial court&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 10, Republic Act 875);<br>"(2) When the controversy refers to minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law&nbsp; (Republic Act&nbsp; 602);<br>"(3) When it involves hours&nbsp; of employment under the&nbsp; Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth&nbsp; Act 444); and<br>"(4) When it involves an unfair labor practice&nbsp; (section 5[a], Republic Act 875).<br><br>"In all other cases, even if they grow out of a labor dispute, the industrial court&nbsp; does not have&nbsp; jurisdiction, the policy&nbsp; of the law being to advance the settlement of disputes between the employers and the employees through collective bargaining, recognizing 'that the real industrial&nbsp; peace cannot be&nbsp; achieved by compulsion of law' (section&nbsp; 1[c], in relation to&nbsp; section 20, Republic Act 875)."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; further&nbsp; maintains that the petition in question, which involves&nbsp; a controversy foreign to those litigated&nbsp; in the main&nbsp; case,&nbsp; cannot be said&nbsp; to&nbsp; be an incident thereof, as said&nbsp; principal&nbsp; case had&nbsp; already been&nbsp; decided as&nbsp; far back as November 5, 1948, and therefore no longer pending at the time of the passage of the Industrial&nbsp; Peace Act whereby the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations is empowered to continue processing cases then pending,&nbsp; under&nbsp; Commonwealth Act 103,&nbsp; as amended; and&nbsp; that neither could said court have jurisdiction under the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; Act, because the issue&nbsp; involved is a demand concerning terms&nbsp; or conditions&nbsp; of&nbsp; employment which, under&nbsp; R. A. 875,&nbsp; is a proper subject of collective&nbsp; bargaining as&nbsp; a means&nbsp; of promoting sound,&nbsp; stable industrial&nbsp; peace.<br><br>There&nbsp; is no&nbsp; dispute 1) that although&nbsp; officially and on paper the 51 members of the Union were employed by the&nbsp; National Development&nbsp; Company&nbsp; as workers&nbsp; or laborers&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; daily wage basis and as&nbsp; such should work eight hours a day or 48&nbsp; hours a week, they were, however, designated or assigned to perform, as in fact they did perform, regular office work&nbsp; in the administrative&nbsp; offices of the company&nbsp; as typists,&nbsp; stenographers, bookkeepers and accountants; "2) that&nbsp; the&nbsp; regular office hours observed&nbsp; by the monthly-paid&nbsp; regular&nbsp; employees of the company is from&nbsp; 8:00&nbsp; to 12:00 in the morning and&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon from Mondays through&nbsp; Fridays, or seven hours a&nbsp; day, and from&nbsp; 8:00 a.m. to 1:00. p.m., or&nbsp; 5 hours, on&nbsp; Saturdays, or a&nbsp; total of 40&nbsp; hours a&nbsp; week; 3)&nbsp; that these&nbsp; 51&nbsp; members were required&nbsp; to work eight hours&nbsp; every day&nbsp; from&nbsp; Monday to Saturday, or 48 hours a week,&nbsp; that is&nbsp; to&nbsp; say, from 8:00 to&nbsp; 12:00&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; mornings and from&nbsp; 1:00&nbsp; to&nbsp; 5:00 in the afternoons from&nbsp; Mondres through&nbsp; Fridays, and from 8:00&nbsp; a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and from&nbsp; 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays; and 4) that for these&nbsp; eight extra hours a&nbsp; week&nbsp; they were paid&nbsp; from the beginning&nbsp; of their designation or&nbsp; assignment as office employees until the end&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1950 when the&nbsp; company stopped&nbsp; paying them for said&nbsp; extra&nbsp; hours&nbsp; of&nbsp; work&nbsp; upon the recommendation of its auditor.<br><br>Under&nbsp; the circumstances and in view of the aforestated conduct of the herein petitioner,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court was fully justified in upholding the right of the 51 respondents herein to claim compensation for said extra hours.&nbsp; In fact, petitioner&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; openly assail such right, for the only issue it raised in its petition is "whether&nbsp; or not respondent Court of Industrial Relations had jurisdiction&nbsp; over the case."<br><br>The record shows that the&nbsp; main&nbsp; case,&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 129-V, was&nbsp; filed, litigated and decided in&nbsp; 1948 under Commonwealth Act 103, as amended.&nbsp; Unlike in ordinary courts that once the decision acquires finality the case is said to be terminated,&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations is granted ample powers, during the effectiveness of the award, to&nbsp; alter, modify&nbsp; in whole&nbsp; or&nbsp; in&nbsp; part,&nbsp; or even set&nbsp; aside the award or decision,&nbsp; or&nbsp; reopen the&nbsp; case. Thus Section 17 of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; 103 provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 17. <i>Limit of&nbsp; Effectiveness of&nbsp; Award</i>.—An award,&nbsp; order or decision of the Court shall be valid&nbsp; and effective during&nbsp; the time therein specified.&nbsp; In the absence of&nbsp; such&nbsp; specification, any party or both parties to a controversy may terminate the&nbsp; effectiveness of an&nbsp; award,&nbsp; order or&nbsp; decision after three&nbsp; years&nbsp; have elapsed from the date&nbsp; of said award, order&nbsp; or&nbsp; decision&nbsp; by&nbsp; giving notice to that effect to the Court: Provided, However, <i>That anytime during the effectiveness of an award, order or decision, the Court may, on application of&nbsp; an interested party, and&nbsp; after due hearing, alter, modify in whole or in part, or set aside&nbsp; any such award,&nbsp; order or decision, or reopen any question involved&nbsp; therein</i>"<br></blockquote>When Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 875 was&nbsp; enacted in June,&nbsp; 1953, curtailing some of the powers of the Court of Industrial Relations granted by Commonwealth Act 103, it did not deprive said court from taking cognizance&nbsp; of&nbsp; cases wrested from&nbsp; its jurisdiction by Republic Act&nbsp; 875;&nbsp; on the&nbsp; contrary, it empowered&nbsp; said&nbsp; court to process&nbsp; them in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; C. A. 103,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; the transitory provision of the Industrial Peace Act found in Section 27 thereof, authorized the court in the following language:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 27. <i>Transitory Provision.</i>—All cases&nbsp; pending before&nbsp;&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations at the time of passage of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Act shall be processed by the Court according to Commonwealth&nbsp; Act Numbered One hundred three, as&nbsp; amended by Commonwealth Acts Numbered Two hundred fifty-four, Three hundred fifty-five&nbsp; and Five hundred fifty-nine but the&nbsp; judges of the Court shall&nbsp; call both parties to the dispute and make every attempt to help them reach a just and&nbsp; speedy&nbsp; solution&nbsp; by mutual&nbsp; agreement."<br></blockquote>True&nbsp; that&nbsp; the main case, No. 129-V,&nbsp; had already been decided five&nbsp; years&nbsp; prior to&nbsp; the passage&nbsp; of&nbsp; R.&nbsp; A. 875; but&nbsp; it is equally true&nbsp; that at the effectivity of said&nbsp; Act the&nbsp; case was&nbsp; still open,&nbsp; unsettled and pending&nbsp; in view of the various incidental questions relative to the processing of the award,&nbsp; and under the transitory provision above transcribed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations was duly empowered to&nbsp; continue processing the&nbsp; case under C. A. 103,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended.&nbsp; And when the petition in&nbsp; question came up in August, 1956, which was the seventh incident in the&nbsp; case and for&nbsp; which&nbsp; reason it was&nbsp; docketed as No.&nbsp; 129-V(7), the whole&nbsp; case was&nbsp; still&nbsp; open&nbsp; and unsettled.&nbsp; In fact, only on May 25, 1957, or June 1,&nbsp; 1957, was the award in the main case deemed terminated&nbsp; when herein petitioner, by virtue of Section 17 of C. A. 103, asked that the effectiveness of the award&nbsp; be terminated (Annexes&nbsp; 6 and 7,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Court).&nbsp; The Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; in calling&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 129-V(7) for hearing presumably to&nbsp; "make every attempt to help&nbsp; them (the parties) reach a just and speedy solution by mutual agreement,"&nbsp; did nothing but comply&nbsp; with the transitory provision .above referred to.&nbsp; Evidently the parties&nbsp; were at loggerheads and have failed to reach an&nbsp; agreement that the court&nbsp; had to&nbsp; hear the case and receive&nbsp; evidence which served as the basis for issuing the order of October 12, 1957.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower court, in so doing, acted within its jurisdiction not only under C. A. 103, as amended, but under R. A. 875 as&nbsp; well.<br><br>Petition denied, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
