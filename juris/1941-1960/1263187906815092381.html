				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an action to compel the mayor of the municipality of Ronda,
province of Cebu, to approve and sign the municipal payroll for the
period from 16 to 31 January 1956 and subsequent payrolls, and the
provincial auditor, the provincial treasurer and the municipal
treasurer to pass them in audit, approve and pay the salary of the
petitioner as chief of police, and to recover from them actual, moral
and exemplary damages in the sum of P5,000. The answer of the
respondents is that the petitioner was appointed by councilor Toribio
Chiong, who had no authority to make the appointment, and that the
respondent mayor, by executive order No. 4, dated 16 January 1956,
advised the petitioner of the illegality of his appointment and
terminated on that date his services as such chief of police. They
prayed for the dismissal of the petition with costs against the
petitioner.
  <p>    This case was jointly heard with civil case No. R-4699 of the Court of First Instance of Cebu entitled Domingo Cui, et al., <i>vs.</i>
Lucio Ortiz, et al., and the two cases were submitted for judgment upon

    </blockquote>
        
From a judgment dismissing the petition, the petitioner has appealed.
    <p>
The appointment of the petitioner as chief of police of the
municipality of Ronda, province of Cebu, was signed by councilor
Toribio Chiong, who on 16 December 1955 took over the office of mayor
by designation made by ex-mayor Fortunato Villalon. In the general
elections of November 1951, Fortunato Villalon was elected mayor, and
the councilor who obtained the highest number of votes among the
candidates for councilor was Lucio Ortiz. After Lucio Ortiz the next
councilor who received the highest number of votes was Lourdes V.
Diama. In the general election of November 1955, Lucio Ortiz ran for
municipal mayor of Ronda, was elected, and assumed office on 1 January
1956. Mayor Fortunato Villalon designated Toribio Chiong as acting
mayor during his absence and that of the vice-mayor, because Lucio
Ortiz, the first councilor, could not act as mayor, he having filed a
certificate of candidacy for the office of mayor of Ronda. During the
incumbency of Toribio Chiong as acting Mayor of Ronda by designation,
the petitioner was appointed chief of police. Having been elected to
the office of mayor and after assuming the office on 1 January 1956,
Lucio Ortiz found that the appointment of the petitioner as chief of
police was illegal, so he served upon him notice of the termination of
his service.</p>
  <p>    Section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
Upon the occasion of the absence, suspension, or other temporary
disability of the mayor, his duties shall be discharged by the
vice-mayor, or if there be no vice-mayor, by the councilor who at the
last general election received the highest number of votes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The designation by Fortunato Villalon of councilor Toribio Chiong who
was the fifth in point of number of votes received in the general
elections of 1951 is not as provided in the above quoted section of the
Revised Administrative Code. Such being the case, his designation to
act as mayor was illegal. Not being a <i>de jure</i> officer he could
not appoint the petitioner as chief of police of the municipality of
Ronda. In fact the petitioner's appointment as chief of police was
neither approved by the Commissioner of Civil Service nor by the
President of the Philippines, as required in paragraph 14, Executive
Order No. 175, series of 1938, and was withdrawn by the respondent
mayor before the Bureau of Civil Service and the Office of the
President of the Philippines could act on it, and the appointment of
Honorato R. Villafañe, also a civil service eligible, as chief of
police of the municipality of Ronda, effective 16 January 1956 was
approved.</p>
  <p>    The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs in both instances.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera</i>, and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ</i>., concur.<br> 
    <i>Bengzon, J</i>., took no part. </p>
