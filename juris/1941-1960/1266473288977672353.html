				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime in 1953, Mrs. Trinidad de Leon Vda. de Roxa filed an action in the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila for the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage made m her favor by the espouses Fernando Ocampo and Lourdes Luciano Ocampo for the security of a debt of P120,000.00 payable with 10%&nbsp; interest.&nbsp; As&nbsp; several months&nbsp; elapsed&nbsp; without the case being heard, the plaintiff Mrs. Roxas,&nbsp; after consulting Judge Gavino S.&nbsp; Abaya, then presiding one of the branches of the court, withdrew her suit,&nbsp; and availing of the services of herein petitioner Atty. Rosario&nbsp; de Jesus-Alano&nbsp; upon the recommendation of&nbsp; Judge Abaya, sought extrajudicial foreclosure, pursuant&nbsp; to Act No. 3135,&nbsp; as amended, by&nbsp; filing&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; application&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Sheriff of Manila.&nbsp; Acting on the application, the sheriff sold the mortgaged property at public auction and out of the net proceeds of the&nbsp; sale delivered to Mrs.&nbsp; Roxas the sum of P153,020.00 representing the principal of the mortgage loan and its compounded&nbsp; interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it&nbsp; appears that, in addition to the said sum, Mrs. Roxas claimed that she was entitled to 10%&nbsp; attorney's fees, or P15,302.00, for on April 27, 1954 the&nbsp; herein petitioner Rosario de JesusAlano acting "for and in behalf" of Mrs. Roxas and signing as her attorney, so informed the sheriff by letter and&nbsp; even asked that the claim for attorney's fees be given preference over other claims.&nbsp; Due to&nbsp; this claim of&nbsp; Mrs. Roxas, the sheriff refused to satisfy fully from&nbsp; the balance of the proceeds still in his hands the claims of various creditors against the&nbsp; Ocampo espouses until the said claim could be decided by the court.&nbsp; And the sheriff having in&nbsp; particular declined to pay a part of the claim of judgment creditor Pacita de los&nbsp; Reyes Philipps, the latter brought suit in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 22881) impleading, among others, the sheriff and Mrs. Roxas, as defendants, for the payment of the balance of her claim amounting to P5.145.50,&nbsp; plus&nbsp; damages.&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint alleged&nbsp; that Mrs. Roxas was not entitled to any attorney's fees because&nbsp; the mortgage provided for the&nbsp; payment of such fee&nbsp; only&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of judicial&nbsp; foreclosure.&nbsp; In&nbsp; her answer, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; signed by&nbsp; herein petitioner Rosario de Jesus-Alano as attorney, Mrs. Roxas reiterated her claim for attorney's fees and citing Art. 2208 of&nbsp; the new&nbsp; Civil Code, contended that it was only just and&nbsp; equitable that such fees&nbsp; be&nbsp; paid to her.&nbsp; The answer also&nbsp; contained a counterclaim for moral damages.&nbsp; After hearing, the court, in its decision dated&nbsp; January 31, 1955,&nbsp; denied the claim for damages and fixed the amount to be paid by the sheriff out of the money still in his hands to the different claimants. And&nbsp; considering the&nbsp; extrajudicial as but&nbsp; a continuation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judicial foreclosure previously&nbsp; filed and on the authority of articles 1167,&nbsp; 1247&nbsp; and 2208 of the new Civil Code, the&nbsp; court made the following adjudication in favor of Mrs. Roxas:<br><blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED,&nbsp; the Sheriff of the City of Manila is hereby ordered to deliver the corresponding&nbsp; claims of the&nbsp; claimants in the following order of priority:<br><br>"1. To Mrs.&nbsp; Trinidad&nbsp; de Leon&nbsp; Vda.&nbsp; de Roxas, the amount of P2,500.00 representing her attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in the foreclosure proceedings;"<br></blockquote>Two months&nbsp; thereafter, or on March 31, 1955,&nbsp; on&nbsp; motion of&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Rosario de Jesus-Alano,&nbsp; the court issued the following&nbsp; order of execution:<br><blockquote>"Petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; execution dated March 30, 1955, filed by counsel for defendant Mrs.&nbsp; Trinidad&nbsp; de Leon Vda. de Roxas being meritorious, the same is&nbsp; granted.&nbsp; Let a writ of execution issue in this case and the amount&nbsp; of P2,500.00 be delivered to Atty. Rosario de Jesus Alano being the lawyer of defendant Mrs. Trinidad de Leon Vda. de Roxas, <br><br>SO ORDERED."<br></blockquote>In obedience to&nbsp; this order, the&nbsp; sheriff, on April 21, 1955, delivered to herein petitioner Central Bank Check No. CB063360&nbsp; in the sum&nbsp; of P2,497.00.<br><br>Some 55 days thereafter, or on June 15, 1955, Atty. Jose Topacio Nueno, as attorney for Mrs. Roxas, filed in the same court&nbsp; a petition oh her behalf, alleging in substance that the sum adjudged to&nbsp; her in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 22881 as attorney's fee belong to her and not to Rosario de Jesus-Alano, who&nbsp; had no right to the same because she had never engaged the latter's professional services as a lawyer&nbsp; and if the latter had any&nbsp; claim for such services, said claim had&nbsp; already been fully satisfied with the P350.00 paid to her; that the motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; execution&nbsp; was filed by&nbsp; Rosario de Jesus-Alano&nbsp; without her, Mrs. Roxas', knowledge&nbsp; and consent; and that she was&nbsp; not even notified thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Roxas, therefore, asked that Atty.&nbsp; Rosario de Jesus-Alano be ordered to deliver the sum of P2,500.00 to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; By way of answer&nbsp; to this petition, Atty.&nbsp; Rosario de Jesus-Alano filed a manifestation stating, among other things, that the court had already&nbsp; lost its jurisdiction over the case, the judgment haying already&nbsp; become final; that the order of execution directing the delivery to her of&nbsp; the amount of P2,500.00 was based on the fact that she acted as counsel for Mrs. Roxas in the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings against the Ocampo espouses, and the amount was awarded, upon her petition, in her favor, "as her lien for her attorney's fees"; that all she received from Mrs. Roxas for fees and&nbsp; expenses was the&nbsp; amount of P350.00; and that in the case instituted&nbsp; by Pacita de los Reyes Philipps she again represented Mrs. Roxas but only to get her attorney's fees. After hearing, the court&nbsp; rendered on June 18,&nbsp; 1955 an order which reads in part as follows:<br><blockquote>"In view of the sworn statement submitted by Mrs. Roxas and in order to determine, first,&nbsp; if Atty. Alano was&nbsp; really the lawyer of Mrs. Roxas or not, and second if the answer is in the affirmative, to&nbsp; what amount said Mrs. Alano is entitled for her services in accordance with&nbsp; the accepted rules&nbsp; as laid down in the&nbsp; case of Delgado <i>vs.</i> De la Rama,&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; hereby orders Atty. Alano to return and deposit with the Clerk of&nbsp; Court the amount of P2,500.00 within five (5) days from&nbsp; today and&nbsp; upon her failure to do so, the Court will declare said Atty. Alano in contempt of court and&nbsp; order her immediate arrest.<br><br>"The Court hereby sets&nbsp; the hearing of this motion on Saturday, June 25, 1955, at 8; 00 o'clock in the morning, for. the reception of evidence of both&nbsp; parties&nbsp; in support of their respective contentions."<br></blockquote>Atty.&nbsp; Rosario de Jesus-Alano&nbsp; asked for reconsideration of the order, contending that the court&nbsp; acted without jurisdiction&nbsp; because the decision of January 31,&nbsp; 1965&nbsp; is not only final but was already executed and the court&nbsp; had no power to modify it as no motion to set it aside under Rule 38&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court had been&nbsp; presented; that as counsel to Mrs,&nbsp; Roxas, she is&nbsp; unquestionably entitled to receive the amount of&nbsp; P2,500.00 since the&nbsp; latter does not claim the amount as her own but as fees for her attorney; that the petition of Mrs. Roxas&nbsp; is in the nature of a suit, and that the order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court requiring&nbsp; her, petitioner, to&nbsp; deposit the amount with the clerk of court is&nbsp; in the nature of&nbsp; a preliminary attachment,&nbsp; which is illegal because it is not based on&nbsp; any of the grounds provided for in&nbsp; the Rules of Court; that the order was issued without hearing evidence and therefore violative of the due process clause of the Constitution; and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; order is likewise violative&nbsp; of the constitutional&nbsp; "provision&nbsp; that no&nbsp; person shall be imprisoned for debt and that an accused&nbsp; is presumed innocent until the contrary is&nbsp; proved,&nbsp; since in the event that she, petitioner, has&nbsp; no money now to&nbsp; deposit with the clerk of court, she would be arrested in accordance with the tenor of the order.&nbsp; The motion&nbsp; having been denied, Atty. Rosario&nbsp; de Jesus-Alano has now come to this Court through a&nbsp; petition for certiorari&nbsp; to have the order of June&nbsp; 18, 1955 annulled "as issued without jurisdiction, besides being&nbsp; manifestly arbitrary,&nbsp; unjust, and unconstitutional."<br><br>The petition, we think, should be granted.<br><br>Examining the decision&nbsp; of January 31, 1955&nbsp; in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 22881, we there find that&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court,&nbsp; in awarding&nbsp; the amount of P2,500.00 in favor of&nbsp; the respondent Mrs. Roxas as "attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in the foreclosure proceedings,'1 took into account the standing of her attorney—obviously referring to herein petitioner Rosario de Jesus-Alano—and actually considered that amount&nbsp; as the "equitable and just attorney's fees." Thus the court said:<br><blockquote>"With respect to this point, the Court believes&nbsp; and so holds that the amount of P2,500.00 is a reasonable amount that can be given to Mrs.&nbsp; Roxas as her&nbsp; attorney's fees and other incidental expenses incurred by her in&nbsp; the foreclosure of the mortgage judicially and extrajudicially.&nbsp; under the circumstances, and taking into account the standing of her attorney, the Court considers this amount&nbsp; of P2.500.00 as the equitable and just attorney's fees."<br></blockquote>The respondent Mrs. Roxas, who&nbsp; appears&nbsp; to be claiming the amount of P2,500.00&nbsp; not for herself but for her attorney, has not contested the value of the&nbsp; professional services rendered by her lawyer, herein petitioner,&nbsp; as&nbsp; fixed by the lower court.&nbsp; Indeed, the decision has&nbsp; already become final and&nbsp; therefore conclusive as to the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither has Mrs. Roxas claimed that she&nbsp; engaged the legal&nbsp; services of an attorney&nbsp; other than herein petitioner Atty.&nbsp; Rosario de Jesus-Alano for&nbsp; the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage made in her favor.&nbsp; Another attorney, it is true represented her, Mrs. Roxas,&nbsp; in the action filed for judicial foreclosure—which&nbsp; was later withdrawn without the case being heard—that it does not appear that this&nbsp; attorney has&nbsp; ever asserted&nbsp; any claim&nbsp; for&nbsp; attorney's fees.&nbsp; This could very&nbsp; well be&nbsp; the explanation why Mrs. Roxas did not insist upon&nbsp; her original claim of P15,032.00 for attorney's fees and&nbsp; instead had&nbsp; it reduced to&nbsp; only P3,000.00. Upon the other&nbsp; hand, it is not disputed that petitioner had actually rendered professional services to&nbsp; Mrs.&nbsp; Roxas in the foreclosure proceedings which resulted in the&nbsp; latter being able to recover the total sum of P153,020.00 representing the principal of the mortgage loan and its&nbsp; compounded interest.&nbsp; The&nbsp; record also shows that petitioner appeared as counsel for Mrs. Roxas in Civil Case No. 22881, which appearance, in the absence of any showing to the contrary, is presumed to be&nbsp; authorized.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; Rule 127, Rules of Court.)<br><br>It&nbsp; will thus be seen&nbsp; that the lower court has, in its decision of January 31,&nbsp; 1955 in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 22881, already fixed&nbsp; at P2,500.00 the value of herein petitioner's legal services&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; to Mrs.&nbsp; Roxas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, the court was familiar with the nature and extent of petitioner's professional services to Mrs. Roxas,&nbsp; for it expressly found that amount "under the circumstances and&nbsp; taking into account the standing of her attorney&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; as the equitable and just attorney's fees."&nbsp; Such being the&nbsp; case, and considering the facts on record, we see no valid reason Why the court should still require a hearing to determine, as stated in the order complained of, petitioner's right to attorney's fees and compel her to&nbsp; pay the sum of P2,500.00 into the court preliminary to that hearing under pain of contempt and imprisonment in case of failure to do so. To hold such a hearing&nbsp; would only result in duplicity of proceedings and would furthermore have the effect of permitting the reopening of a case which has already become final.<br><br>In any event, it is to be observed that the&nbsp; amount of P2,500.00 in question was by the writ of execution ordered delivered to petitioner, she "being the lawyer of the defend&nbsp;&nbsp; ant Mrs. Trinidad&nbsp; de Leon&nbsp; Vda. de Roxas."&nbsp; Petitioner has, therefore, acquired, and may validly exercise, a general or. retaining lien&nbsp; over the amount of P2,500.00.&nbsp; As provided in the first sentence of section 33 of Rule 127 of the Rules of Court, "An attorney shall have a lien&nbsp; upon the funds, documents and papers of his client&nbsp; which have law&nbsp; fully&nbsp; come into his possession,&nbsp; and may retain&nbsp; the&nbsp; same until&nbsp; his lawful fees and disbursements have been&nbsp; paid, and&nbsp; may&nbsp; apply such funds to&nbsp; the satisfaction&nbsp; thereof." Such lien has been held to extend to moneys collected by the attorney for his client in the course of his employment, whether or not upon&nbsp; a judgment or award.&nbsp;&nbsp; (5&nbsp; Am. Jur. p. 389.)&nbsp; The petitioner being in possession of the general or retaining lien conceded to&nbsp; her by the first part of section&nbsp; 33 of Rule 127, there can be no question that she had the right to retain the amount of P2,500.00 and to apply it to the satisfaction of her&nbsp; claim for attorney's&nbsp; fees, the same having been&nbsp; already&nbsp; adjudicated as the reasonable value of her professional services to the respondent Mrs. Roxas.&nbsp; Courts, in the exercise&nbsp; of their&nbsp; exclusive and supervisory authority over attorneys as officers of&nbsp; the court, are bound to respect and protect the attorney's lien, which, as held in the case of Rustia <i>vs.</i> Abeto (72 Phil.,&nbsp; 133), "is necessary to preserve the&nbsp; decorum and&nbsp; respectability of the profession."&nbsp; (See&nbsp; also Ulanday <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Manila Railroad Co., 45 Phil., 540.)<br><br>We note, however, that petitioner had already been paid by the respondent Mrs. Roxas the amount of P350.00 during the foreclosure proceedings.&nbsp; That amount, in the light of the view we have taken&nbsp; of the case—not to mention the fact&nbsp; that there is no claim that the amount of&nbsp; P2,500.00 adjudicated as professional fees is unreasonable or insufficient—should be returned to the respondent Mrs. Roxas.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; it being&nbsp; understood that the&nbsp; amount of P350.00 shall be returned by&nbsp; petitioner to the respondent Mrs.&nbsp; Trinidad&nbsp; de Leon Vda. de&nbsp; Roxas, the petition for certiorari is granted,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; preliminary injunction&nbsp; heretofore issued made permanent.&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
