				<BR><STRONG>HILADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Three counts were alleged in the information filed with the People's Court 
against the instant appellant, a Filipino citizen, on December 1, 1945.
<p>That court dismissed the first count but convicted appellant under the 
remaining two. The second count charges that on or about October 23, 1944, in 
Sta. Rosa, Laguna, Philippines, said appellant, acting as informer or agent of 
the Imperial Japanese Forces in the Philippines, for the purpose of and with, 
intent to give aid and/or comfort to the said enemy, with the aid of a group of 
armed men who afforded him impunity and taking advantage of the darkness of the 
night, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and treasonably 
lead, accompany and participate in the apprehension, arrest and investigation of 
one Gonrado Hernandez, suspected of being a guerrilla member, and thereupon the 
said appellant did brutally maltreat and torture the said Gonrado Hernandez upon 
the latter's denial of any guerrila connection.</p>
<p>The third count charges appellant with having in December, 1944t &amp;nd in 
the municipality of Sta. Rosa, in order to make more effective the aid or 
comfort which he intended to give the same enemy, voluntarily enlisted and 
served as member of the Makapili, the military nature and purposes of which 
organization were described in People <em>vs.</em> Adriano,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> G. R. No. L-477, promulgated June 30, 1947, 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * the mere fact of having joined a Makapili organization is evidence of 
both adherence to the enemy and giving him aid and comfort. Unless forced upon 
one against his will, membership in the Makapili organization imports 
treasonable intent, considering the purposes for which the organization was 
created, which, according to the evidence, were "to accomplish the fulfillment 
of the obligations assumed by the Philippines in the Pact of Alliance with the 
Empire of Japan;" "to shed blood and sacrifice the lives of our people in order 
to eradicate Anglo-Saxon influence in East Asia', "to collaborate unreservedly 
and unstintedly with the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in the Philippines;" 
and "to fight the common enemies.' "</p></blockquote>
<p>The third count also charges appellant with having voluntarily joined and 
evacuated with the Japanese Army in its Retreat to the mountains of Luzon, and 
with having stayed and remained with said army until he was apprehended and 
captured by the American and guerrilla forces.</p>
<p>After due trial, the People's Court in a unanimous decision of the Fourth 
Division, found appellant guilty of treason and imposed upon him the penalty of 
15 years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, with the accessories of the law, and to 
pay a fine of P5,000.00, plus the costs, "taking into special consideration the 
degree of malice on the part of the accused in the commission of the offense as 
may be gleaned from the evidence as well as the extent of the acts of the 
accused and the low degree of his instruction and education which is apparent". 
Prom that judgment, appellant has taken the case on appeal to this Court.</p>
<p>As appears from the foregoing quotation, we have already held in the Adriano 
case that mere membership in the Makapili is treason under Article 114 of the 
revised Penal Code for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At the same time, being a Makapili is in itself constitutive of an overt 
act. It is not necessary, except for the purpose of increasing the punishment, 
that the defendant actually went to battle or committed nefarious acts against 
his country or countrymen. The crime of treason was committed if he placed 
himself at the enemy's call to fight side by side with him when the opportune 
time came even though an opportunity never presented itself. Such membership by 
its very nature gave the enemy aid and comfort. The enemy derived psychologial 
comfort in the knowledge that he had on his side nationals of the country with 
which his was at war. It furnished the enemy aid in that his cause was advanced, 
his forces augmented, and his courage was enhanced by the knowledge that he 
could count on men such as the accused and his kind who were ready to strike et 
their own people. The practical effect of it was no different from that of 
enlisting in the invader's army."</p></blockquote>
<p>The prosecution has clearly complied with the two- witness rule in its 
evidence supporting the third count, which concerns appellant's membership in 
the Makapili, and his acts as a member thereof. (Testimony of Conrado 
Hernandez, t.s.n., pp. 15-17, 18-19, 32-33, February 11, 1946; testimony of 
Leonarda Gindia, t.s.n., pp, 3-4, February 11, 1946; and p. 4, March 29, 
1946.)</p>
<p>This suffices to affirm the judgment appealed from without need of entering 
into a detailed discussion of the assignment of error presented by appellant's 
counsel as to compliance with the two-witness rule respecting count No. 2.</p>
<p>Wherefore, judgement is affirmed, with costs against appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</em> and <em>Tuason, 
JJ.,</em> concur. </p><em>Paras, Actg., C.J.,</em> concurs in the result. 
<br><br><em>Paras, Actg., C.J.,</em> I hereby certify that Mr, Chief Justice Moran voted for the affirmance of the 
decision appealed from.<br><br>
