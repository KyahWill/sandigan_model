				G.R. No. L-247, March 14, 1946</h4>
				<H3>MONSIG. CAMILO DIEL, PETITIONER, VS. FELIX MARTINEZ. JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CEBU, CESAR KINTANAR, ASSISTANT CITY FISCAL OF CEBU, AND VICENTE SOTTO, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>On October 24, 1945, information for illegal practice of medicine was filed 
against petitioner. On January 14, 1946, the respondent attorney was permitted, 
over petitioner's objection, to appear in the case as private prosecutor. After 
the order was entered, although retaining full control of the prosecution and 
assuming full responsibility therefor, the fiscal announced that he was turning 
over to said attorney the active conduct of the trial.</p>
<p>Petitioner complains that said order was issued with a grave abuse of 
discretion, there being no offended party named in the information, no damages 
sued to be recovered in the criminal action, and Atty. Vicente Sotto having 
previously announced his expressed reservation to file at a later date the 
corresponding civil action against petitioner.</p>
<p>Respondents answered that all the witnesses who testified before the fiscal 
are offended parties, they having been victims of petitioner; that, although it 
is true that said attorney manifested in open court that he had no objection to 
reserving the right to institute a civil' action, it is not less true that later 
he withdrew said statement so as to bring the case under the provision of Rule 
106, section 15; that the victims of petitioner wanted to recover in the 
criminal case the fees they paid to him; that petitioner has another remedy by 
appeal; and that there is no abuse of discretion in the issuance of the order in 
question.</p>
<p>At the hearing of this case, no one appeared to argue in behalf of 
petitioner. Attorney Juris Sotto appeared for the respondents and, on her 
petition, she was allowed to file a memorandum instead of arguing orally.</p>
<p>As alleged by petitioner, no offended party is named in the information, but 
such omission is not incompatible with the fact that, as alleged by respondents, 
all the witnesses who appeared before the fiscal as alleged victims of 
petitioner should be considered as offended parties, it appearing that the 
offense alleged in the information belongs to the class of harmful ones. If 
there are offended parties, petitioner's contention that no damages are to be 
recovered in the criminal action must be untenable.</p>
<p>The fact that respondent attorney manifested in open court that he had no 
objection to reserving the right to institute a civil action, should not be 
considered for the purpose of applying section 15 of Rule 106, it appearing that 
the statement has been withdrawn being the result of <em>lapsus 
linguae</em>.</p>
<p>Under the facts in this case, we are of opinion that the respondent judge did 
not commit any abuse of discretion or any legal error in permitting the 
intervention of respondent attorney as private prosecutor in the criminal case 
in question.</p>
<p>In fact, we do not see anything objectionable in said intervention if we take 
into consideration that in its order dated January 14, 1946, the lower court 
specifically guaranteed: "The court will see to it that the prosecution of this 
case be pushed through within the bounds of law, will not tolerate persecution 
nor delay. The case will be handled under the full responsibility of the fiscal. 
In ordinary parlance, attorney Sotto will be a guest of fiscal Kintanar, host, 
who may permit attorney Sotto to assist him. From the record of this case it can 
be gleaned that this court has not given consideration to any petition made by 
private prosecutor without the consent of the fiscal."</p>
<p>Section 15 of Rule 106, as interpreted by petitioner, is premised on the 
theory that the prosecution of offenses is a public function. But said public 
function can be performed not exclusively by fiscals or other public officers, 
but by private attorneys in cases where they are allowed to intervene as private 
prosecutors, s After all, in the performance of their professional duties, 
lawyers are officers of the court and assume public and official 
responsibilities.</p>
<p>Petition is dismissed with costs to be taxed against petitioner. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C, J., Ozaeta, Paras, Jaranilla, Feria, De Joya, Pablo, Hilado, 
Bengzon,</em> and <em>Briones, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
