				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the offended parties from an order of dismissal of the 
case as against one of the accused, Roy Franco.
<p>The record discloses that the first complaint filed by a member of the police 
force in the Justice of the Peace Court of Caloocan, Rizal charged Benjamin 
Liggayu y Sion with homicide through reckless imprudence for having run over and 
caused the death of one Teresita Young de Dyogi. Two weeks after the 
presentation of this complaint Leoncio Dyogi, husband of the deceased, and his 
nine children filed another complaint charging not only Liggayu but also Roy 
Franco. The inclusion of Roy Franco as an accused was supported by the 
allegation that after the car driven by Liggayu had run over Teresita Young, 
Liggayu stopped the car and ordered his coaccused Franco to drive it forward, 
and Franco did so in such a negligent manner that the other wheel of the car hit 
Teresita Young and aggravated her injuries. The justice of the peace of 
Caloocan, after a preliminary investigation, remanded the case to the Court of 
First Instance for further proceedings. When the case reached the Court of First 
Instance, the fiscal filed a motion to dismiss the case as against the accused 
Roy Franco. The motion is worded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On investigation of this case preparatory to the filing of the information, 
the undersigned believes that the accused Roy Franco has no criminal 
responsibility in the death of Teresita Young de Dyogi. The accused Benjamin 
Liggayu y Sion admitted being solely responsible for the incident and the 
undersigned believes he is. It appears from the evidence that at the time the 
deceased was run over the accused Benjamin Liggayu was on the 
wheel."</p></blockquote>
<p>The court granted the motion and dismissed the case as against Roy Franco and 
the bond filed by him for his provisional release was cancelled. At the same 
time that the motion for dismissal was filed, the fiscal filed an information 
accusing Benjamin Liggayu alone. The offended parties, husband and children of 
the deceased, have appealed against the order of dismissal, alleging (1) that 
they were not notified of the hearing conducted by the provincial fiscal or of 
the motion for dismissal, and (2) that the court erred in not holding that a 
<em>prima facie</em> case exists against Roy Franco, and in dismissing the case 
against him.</p>
<p>The argument supporting the first alleged error assigned by the appellant is 
based on the cases of Gonzales vs. Court of First Instance of Bulacan, 63 Phil., 
846 and People vs. Bataller, 66 Phil., 422, to the effect that an offended party 
has the right to be heard at all stages of the case and can appeal from any 
decision denying that right. The basis of the right is section 107 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 107. The privileges now secured by law to the person claiming to be 
injured by the commission of an offense to take part in the prosecution of the 
offense and to recover damages for the injury sustained by reason of the same 
shall not be held to be abridged by the provisions of this order; but such 
person may appear and shall be heard either individually or by attorney at all 
stages of the case, and the court upon conviction of the accused may enter 
judgment against him for the damages occasioned by his wrongful act. It shall, 
however, be the duty of the promotor fiscal to direct the prosecution, subject 
to the right of the person injured to appeal from any decision of the court 
denying him a legal right."</p></blockquote>
<p>The above provision is not carried in the revised Rules of Court. On the 
other hand, the new Rules contain the following provisions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 4. <em>Who must prosecute criminal actions</em>.—All criminal actions 
either commenced by complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the 
direction and control of the fiscal." (Rule 106) </p>
<p>"Sec. 15. <em>Intervention of the offended party in criminal action</em>.— 
Unless the offended party has waived the civil action or expressly reserved the 
right to institute it after the termination of the criminal case, and subject to 
the provisions of section 4 hereof, he may intervene, personally or by attorney, 
in the prosecution of the offense." (<em>Id</em>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no room for doubt that while General Orders No. 58 was in force, it 
was the right of the offended party to be notified of the proceedings, including 
thoae on a motion of dismissal as to one of the accused. To this effect are 
decisions of this Court in cases brought before the hew Rules took effect, like 
the case of People vs. Bataller, <em>supra</em>.</p>
<p>The situation seems to have been changed, however, because of the clear 
change in the law. The right to appeal from an order of dismissal granted by the 
court on motion of the fiscal may now be challenged under the theory that the 
right of an offended party to intervene is subject to the <em>fiscal's right of 
control</em>. To permit an offended party to appeal from an order dismissing a 
criminal case upon petition of the fiscal would be tantamount to giving said 
party as much right to the direction and control of a criminal proceeding as 
that of the fiscal. Granting that the right of appeal is recognized under the 
old law (Sec. 107, Gen. Orders No. 58), it would seem that under the new law, 
especially section 4 of Rule 106 which provides that the prosecution shall be 
"under the direction and control of the fiscal," without the limitation imposed 
by section 107 of General Orders No. 58 subjecting the direction of the 
prosecution to the right "of the person injured to appeal from any decision of 
the court denying him a legal right," said right to appeal by an offended party 
from an order of dismissal should no longer be recognized in the offended party. 
Under General Orders No. 58, the fiscal was merely to <em>direct</em> the 
prosecution and this <em>direction</em> is subject to the right of the offended 
party; under the new Rules of Court, the fiscal has the <em>direction</em> and 
<em>control</em> of the prosecution, without being subject to the right of 
intervention on the part of the offended party. Even under the old Code of 
Criminal Procedure (Gen. Orders No. 58) this Court has held that if the criminal 
action is dismissed by the court on motion of the provincial fiscal upon the 
ground of insufficiency of the evidence, the offended party has no right to 
appeal, his remedy being a separate civil action if the proper reservation is 
made therefor. (People <em>vs</em>. Joaquin Lipana, 72 Phil. 166.) To the same 
effect is the case of People <em>vs</em>. Florendo, 73 Phil., 679, decided under 
the new Rules of Court, wherein we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is thus evident, in the light of the history of the enactment of section 
107 of General Orders No. 58, as reflected in the observations of one of its 
framers and the explanatory decisions of this Court, that the offended party 
may, as of right, intervene in the prosecution of a criminal action, but then 
only when, from the nature of the offense, he is entitled to indemnity and his 
action therefor has not by him been waived or expressly reserved. This is the 
rule we have now embodied in section 15 of Rule 106 of the new Rules of Court, 
elsewhere quoted. But, as expressly provided in this same section, this right of 
intervention in appropriate cases is subject to the provision of section 4 of 
the same Rule which reads as follows:</p>
<p>" 'All criminal actions either commenced by complaint or information shall be 
prosecuted under the direction and control of the fiscal.'</p>
<p>As a necessary corollary to this provision, we laid down the principle that 
even if the offense is one where civil indemnity might rightly be claimed, if 
the criminal action is dismissed by the court, on motion of the fiscal, on the 
ground of insufficiency of the evidence, the offended party cannot appeal from 
the order of dismissal because otherwise the prosecution of the offense would, 
in the last analysis, be thrown beyond the direction and control of the fiscal. 
(Gonzales <em>vs</em>. Court of First Instance of Bulacan, <em>supra</em>; 
People <em>vs</em>. Orais, <em>supra</em>; People <em>vs</em>. Moll, 40 Off. 
Gaz., 2d Supp., p. 231; People <em>vs</em>. Lipana, 40 Off. Gaz, 3456.) In the 
cases cited, statements were, however, made by this Court importing a grant of 
right to the offended party to appeal upon a question of law. We reaffirm these 
statements as a correct qualification of the rule, it being understood, however, 
that such right to appeal upon a question of law presupposes the existence of a 
rightful claim to civil indemnity and the offended party has neither waived nor 
reserved expressly his action therefor."</p></blockquote>
<p>In a post-liberation case decided by us, with the concurrence of three of the 
present members of the Court, Justices Paras, Bengzon and Padilla and that of 
Chief Justice Moran, Justice Feria held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Besides, even if the offended party has not instituted a separate civil 
action nor reserved his right to do so, and has intervened in the prosecution of 
the criminal action, as his intervention is subject to the direction and control 
of the fiscal, that is, the provincial fiscal or the Solicitor General, the 
latter in the exercise of his authority to control the prosecution has the right 
to move for the dismissal of the appeal interposed by the offended party, if 
such dismissal would not affect the right of the offended party to civil 
indemnity. And in the present case the dismissal of the information or the 
criminal action does not affect the right of the offended party to institute or 
continue the civil action already instituted arising from the offense, because 
such dismissal or extinction of the penal action does not carry with it the 
extinction of the civil one under section 1 (<em>d</em>), Rule 107, Rules of 
Court, * * *." (People <em>vs</em>. Veles, 77 Phil., 1026, 
1028.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the above-mentioned portion of the decision seems to be only an 
additional ground for the judgment, not the <em>ratio decidendi</em> and, 
therefore, merely an <em>obiter</em>, it reflects the opinion that from the 
adoption of section 4 of Rule 106, granting the fiscal "the direction and 
control of prosecution," the right to appeal from an order of dismissal based on 
the motion of the fiscal, should be denied to the offended party, because such 
right of appeal will curtail or limit the control that the fiscal exercises over 
the prosecution of a criminal case, which control is now free from the old 
limitation contained in section 107 of General Orders No: 58.</p>
<p>Let us now apply the principles adopted in the various decision cited above. 
The reason stated in the motion for dismissal is that the fiscal was satisfied 
from the statement of the accused Benjamin Liggayu that the latter alone was 
responsible for the crime. There may have been statements contained in the 
affidavits of witnesses presented at the preliminary investigation to the effect 
that accused Roy Franco was responsible in part for the offense in that he 
supposedly was asked by Liggayu to drive the car after it had already run and 
passed over the body of the deceased Evidently, the fiscal refused to believe 
these statements and preferred to believe the frank confession of Liggayu that 
it was he alone who drove the car. If the fiscal must have control of the 
prosecution of a criminal case, he must have the ultimate power to decide which 
as between two conflicting testimonies should be believed, otherwise said 
control would' be subject to interference or dictation from the offended 
party.</p>
<p>However, appellants' objection is not directed against the unreasonableness 
of the fiscal's decision or opinion on the evidence, but against the supposed 
absence of notice to the offended party of the motion for dismissal, a technical 
unsubstantial objection. As the fiscal made an actual investigation and, 
thereafter, decided that there was no sufficient evidence against Roy Franco, 
notification of his motion to dismiss to the offended party would have served no 
purpose and would be mere idle ceremony, as the fiscal is supposed to have 
direct control. The decision of the fiscal that the evidence against the other 
accused is insufficient is not appealable, under the doctrines pointed out in 
the cases of People <em>vs</em>. Lipana and People <em>vs</em>. Florendo, 
<em>supra</em>, as inconsistent with the fiscal's control of the criminal 
action.</p>
<p>The appeal is hereby dismissed, with costs against the appellants. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
