				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case involves&nbsp; an importation of the respondent Francisco Pascual in 1954&nbsp; of&nbsp; 301 cartons of confectionery on a "no-dollar" remittance basis, which was declared forfeited in favor of the Government by the Manila Collector of Customs for lack of a release certificate as required by Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines.&nbsp; As the shipment was previously released upon the filing of a surety bond, respondent Pascual was ordered to pay in cash the sum of P6,925.00, the amount covered by the bond.&nbsp; The decree of forfeiture was affirmed by the Commissioner of&nbsp; Customs, but&nbsp; on appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals, that court nullified the decree and ordered the surety bond filed by the respondent&nbsp; cancelled on the ground that&nbsp; the Central Bank under its Charter and after the expiration of the Import Control Law (Rep. Act No. 650)&nbsp; on June 30, 1953 had no power to regulate "no-dollar"&nbsp; imports.&nbsp; Contending that the Central Bank has such power, the Commissioner of Customs&nbsp; filed the present petition for review.<br><br>The only question for determination is whether or not the Central Bank of the&nbsp; Philipines has the power to issue Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 in so far as they regulate imports which do not involve the remittance&nbsp; of dollars or foreign exchange.<br><br>In the case of Francisco Pascual&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Commissioner of Customs (105 Phil., 1039;&nbsp; 56 Off. Gaz., [47]&nbsp; 7169), the power of the Monetary Board to issue the aforementioned circulars and the validity thereof have been upheld.&nbsp; Speaking through Mr. Justice Padilla, this Court there said:<br><blockquote>"* * *&nbsp; Even&nbsp; granting that the importations in question do not require an immediate sale of foreign exchange,&nbsp; their&nbsp; importation into the Philippines from another country will&nbsp; ultimately require the sale of such exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; currency of one&nbsp; country&nbsp; is not legal tender in another.&nbsp; To pay for imports, traders have to avail themselves of foreign&nbsp; exchange,&nbsp; which is the conversion of an amount of money&nbsp; or&nbsp; currency of one country into&nbsp; an equivalent amount of money or&nbsp; currency of&nbsp; another.&nbsp; Every import of goods or merchandise requires an immediate or future demand for foreign exchange.<br><br>"SECTION 74. Republic Act No. 265, authorizes the Monetary Board, with the&nbsp; approval of&nbsp; the President, to&nbsp; temporarily&nbsp; suspend or restrict&nbsp; sales of exchange and to&nbsp; subject all transactions in gold and foreign exchange to license during an exchange crisis in order to&nbsp; protect the international reserve and to give the Monetary Board, and&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; time&nbsp; in which to&nbsp; take constructive measures to&nbsp; combat&nbsp; such a crisis. Circular&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 44, prohibiting the release by the Commissioner of Customs of any item of Import without&nbsp; the presentation&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; release certificate issued by&nbsp; the Central&nbsp; Bank or&nbsp; any authorized agent bank in a form prescribed by the Monetary Board, and Circular No. 45, requiring&nbsp; 'any person or entity who intends to import or receive goods from any foreign country for which no foreign exchange is required or&nbsp; will be required of the banks, to apply for a&nbsp; license from the Monetary Board to&nbsp; authorize such import are measures taken to check the unregulated flow of&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; exchange from the country and are within the powers of the Monetary Board.<br><br>"Appellant's contention is that Congress has not authorized the Central&nbsp; Bank to&nbsp; issue&nbsp; regulations governing&nbsp; imports that do not require&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; of foreign&nbsp; exchange, because according to him, it&nbsp; would not have enacted into law Republic Act No. 1410.&nbsp; The contention&nbsp; assumes that&nbsp; the importation do not require the&nbsp; sale foreign&nbsp; exchange, a fact which he failed to&nbsp; establish.<br><br>"Appellant contends that assuming that the importations in Question require the sale of foreign exchange in violation of&nbsp; Circular No.&nbsp; 44, yet&nbsp; they may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be forfeited under the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Circular because it does not expressly&nbsp; provide for the penalty of forfeiture. Circular No. 45 in part requires 'any person or entity who. intends. to import&nbsp; or receive goods&nbsp; from&nbsp; any foreign country for which no foreign exchange&nbsp; is required or will&nbsp; be required&nbsp; of the banks, to apply for a license from the Monetary Board to authorize such import'&nbsp; Circular&nbsp; No. 44&nbsp; requires&nbsp; the presentation of&nbsp; release&nbsp; certificates issued by the Central Bank or any authorized&nbsp; agent bank in a&nbsp; form prescribed by&nbsp; the Monetary&nbsp; Board for the release of import by the Bureau of Customs. Section 1363&nbsp; (f) of&nbsp; the Revised Administrative Code provides:<br><br>Vessels, cargo,&nbsp; merchandise, and other&nbsp; subjects and "things shall, under the conditions hereinbelow specified, be subject to forfeiture:<br><br>(f) Any merchandise of prohibited importation or exportation, the importation or exportation of which is effected or attempted contrary to law,&nbsp; and all&nbsp; other merchandise which, in&nbsp; the opinion of the collector, have been used, are or&nbsp; were&nbsp; intended to be used as&nbsp; instrument in the importation&nbsp; or&nbsp; exportation of&nbsp; the former.<br><br><i>"As already staled, Circulars Nos. 44 and 45 were issued by the Monetary Board within the&nbsp; scope&nbsp; of its powers.</i>&nbsp; They were published in&nbsp; the Official&nbsp; Gazette in&nbsp; June&nbsp; 1953. Appellant failed&nbsp; to present to the Commissioner of&nbsp; Customs&nbsp; release certificates issued by the Central Bank or its duly&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; agent banks for the importations&nbsp; in&nbsp; question.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs may, therefore, seize them and order their forfeiture under the aforequoted provisions of the Revised Administrative Code. It is true that neither of the Circulars provide for&nbsp; the penalty&nbsp; of forfeiture.&nbsp; But since&nbsp; the&nbsp; importations&nbsp; in&nbsp; question&nbsp; were&nbsp; made&nbsp; without the necessary import license issued&nbsp; by the Monetary Board pursuant to Circular&nbsp; No. 45 and the release certificates issued by the Central Bank&nbsp; or its authorized agent bank in the&nbsp; prescribed form pursuant to Circular No. 44, they&nbsp; fall within the class&nbsp; of&nbsp; 'merchandise or prohibited importation' or merchandise 'the importation&nbsp; * * * of which is effected * * *&nbsp; contrary to law'&nbsp; that the Commissioner of Customs may&nbsp; seize and&nbsp; order forfeited.&nbsp; To sustain the appellant's theory of the case&nbsp; would&nbsp; render nugatory the aim&nbsp; and purpose of the law when&nbsp; it authorizes the Central Bank to temporarily suspend or restrict the sale of foreign exchange to licensing during an exchange crisis&nbsp; in order to protect the international reserve and to give the&nbsp; Monetary Board&nbsp; and the Government&nbsp; time&nbsp; in which to take&nbsp;&nbsp; constructive&nbsp; measures&nbsp; to combat&nbsp; such&nbsp; a crisis."&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>The foregoing view was reiterated in&nbsp; Acting Commissioner of Customs m Estanislao Leuterio (G. R.&nbsp; No. L-9142, prom. October 17, 1959) which&nbsp; is on all fours with the present&nbsp; case.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals complained of is reversed, and the decision of the Commissioner of Customs declaring the forfeiture of the importation in question in favor of the Government is affirmed, with costs against respondent Pascual.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
