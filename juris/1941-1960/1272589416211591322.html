				<H3>LIM LIAN TENG, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Marinduque dated December 17, 1951, the dispositive part of which 
reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In view of all the above considerations, this court hereby 
renders judgment finding that the petitioner has all the qualifications and none 
of the disqualifications provided for by the Revised Naturalization Law, which 
entitle him for admission to a naturalized citizen of the Republic of the 
Philippines. Thirty days after this decision becomes final let the necessary 
naturalization certificate be issued by the Clerk of Court upon previously 
taking the prescribed oath the form of which appears in section 12 of the 
statute."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The appellant is the Government. In the brief filed by the 
Solicitor General, the only contention raised is that the appealed decision, in 
so far as its execution is concerned, should be subject to Republic Act No. 530 
which provides that any decision granting the application for Philippine 
citizenship shall become executory only after two years from its promulgation 
and after the court, on proper hearing, with the attendance of the Solicitor 
General or his representative, is satisfied, and so finds, that during the 
intervening time the applicant has (1) not left the Philippines, (2) has 
dedicated himself continuously to a lawful calling or profession, (3) has not 
been convicted of any offense or violation of Government promulgated rules, (4) 
or committed any act prejudicial to the interest of the nation or contrary to 
any government announced policies.</p>
<p align="justify">After the Solicitor General had filed his brief, counsel for 
the petitioner-appellee presented a motion praying that the appellee be excused 
from filing his brief and that the case be considered immediately submitted for 
decision, it being alleged that the appellee concurs in the contention of the 
Solicitor General. This motion, to which the Solicitor General agreed, was 
granted by this Court in its resolution of October 27, 1952.</p>
<p align="justify">Republic Act No. 530 took effect on June 16, 1950, but section 
4 thereof expressly makes the Act applicable to "cases pending in court and to 
those where the applicant has not yet taken the oath of citizenship." It 
appearing that the petition for naturalization was filed on June 12, 1950, the 
appealed decision was rendered only on December 17, 1951, and the appellee has 
not yet taken the oath of citizenship, the Solicitor General's contention—as 
admitted by counsel for the appellee—is absolutely correct.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the appealed decision is modified in the sense that 
its execution shall be subject to the provisions of Republic Act No. 530. So 
ordered, with costs against the petitioner-appellee.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Labrador, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
