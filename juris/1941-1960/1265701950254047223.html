				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 15, 1921, Original Certificate of title No. 8809 of the Property 
Registry of the province of Cebu was issued, covering Cadastral Lot No. 7482 of 
the City of Cebu, in favor and in the names of Antonia, Remedios Antolina, Jose, 
and Juan, all surnamed Brigaudit, the first as the owner of 4/8 and the last 
four as the owners each of 1/8 undivided interest in the land together with the 
improvements existing thereon. These registered owners were brothers and sisters 
who had inherited the said parcel of land and its improvements from their 
deceased parents. In the course of time they also successively died, leaving no 
will, nor descendants, nor ascendants, with the exception of Antonia Brigaudit 
who left two legitimate daughters, the presait appellants jfilomena Llanda and 
Lucia Llanda 
<p>On June 20, 1945, Filomena Llanda, by counsel, filed with the Court of xiirst 
instance of Cebu a verif led petition, praying, upon the grounds therein 
alleged., that after the proper proceedings the said Original Certificate of 
title No. 8809 be ordered cancelled and in its stead a new one issued by the 
register of needs in favor and in the names of the said jfilomena llanda and her 
sister Lucia Llanda, share and. share alike, ins Court of First Instance of Cebu 
ordered the publication of the proper notice in the newspaper <em>Morning 
Times</em> of Cebu, advising the whole world, particularly any interested 
persons, of the filing of said petition, and setting the hearing thereof for the 
23d of July, 1945. The notice was published in the said newspaper once a week 
for three consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing; and. on the 23d of 
July, 1945, at the hour fixed in the notice, the Hearing was held, no opposition 
to the petition having been presented,</p>
<p>The said Court after receiving the evidence of the petitioners, granted their 
petition, and ordered the Register of Deeds of the Province of Gebu to cancel 
the said Original Certificate of title no. 8809 covering said Lot No. 7482 and, 
in its stead, to issue a new one in the names of Filomena Llanda, of legal age, 
married to Guillermo Villostubo, Filipina, and. resident in the City of Cebu, 
and Lucia Llanda, of legal age, married to Faustino Velez, Filipina, and 
Resident in the City of Cebu, share and share alike, subject to the following 
condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" Este pronunciamiento estará sujeto a la reclamacion de cualquier heredero, 
acreedor, legatario o de cualquiera persona interesada, dentro del glazo de dog 
años desde la fecha de esta decisión. "</p></blockquote>
<p>Counsel for Filomena Llanda and Lucia Llanda, in their behalf, riled on July 
27, 1945, a motion for reconsideration, praying that the foregoing condition 
upon which the said court had granted their petition of June 20, 1945, be 
eliminated from the court's decision. That motion for reconsideration having 
been denied, this appeal has been interposed in <em>forma pauperis</em> by the 
said petitioners, which appeal raises the single, question of whether or not the 
lower court erred in subjecting its order to the aforesaid condition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 112 of Act No. 496 contains the following provisions pertinent to the 
question thus presented:</p>
<p>"* * * Any registered owner or other person in interest may at any time apply 
by petition to the court, upon the ground that registered interests of any 
description, Aether vested, contingent, expectant or inchoate, have terminated 
and ceased; or that new interests have arisen or been created which do not 
appear upon the certificate; * * * and the court shall have jurisdiction to hear 
and determine the petition after notice to all parties in interest and may order 
the entry of a new certificate, * * * <em>or grant any other relief upon such 
terms and conditions, requiring security if necessary, as it may deem 
proper</em>; * * *" (Italic supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Government of the Philippine Island vs Serafica, (61 Phil. 93, 
102), which in all essential respects is similar to the one at bar, this Court 
laid down the following procedure, which the lower Court in the case at bar has 
followed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"However, the Justices who concur in this decision are of the opinion that, 
in order to better safeguard the rights of those who may have an interest in the 
land, the trial court should proceed to the publication of the petition in the 
manner provided in section 597 of the Code of Civil Procedure and tnat a 
guardian ad litem. should first be appointed to legally represent the minor 
Veronica Abalos. if after the said publications and the subsequent hearing, the 
material and essential allegations of the petition appear to have been proven, 
then the said court shall grant the said petition, approve tne subdivision plan, 
cancel original certificate of title No. 7154. and require the register of deeds 
to issue new certificates of title to the new lots in favor of the respective 
actual owners thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>If the petitioners herein uad resorted to the procedure laid down in the 
Rules of Court for the summary settlement of estates of small value, any 
adjudication in their favor would have Deen subjected to the conditions and 
limitations provided in Rule 74, sections 3, 4 and 5. instead of doing so, they 
directly filed their petition in the cadastral case under section 112 of Act No. 
496, and the lower Court rightly required the adoption of the same, safeguards 
for the protection of any creditors, heirs or other parties in interest, if any 
there should be, as in the case of such summary settlement and adjudication 
under the Rules of Court. Besides, the very law under which their petition was 
presented, section 112 of Act No. 496, supplies ample authority for the 
requirement imposed by the lower court</p>
<p>The appealed judgment is affirmed without costs.</p><em>Ozaete, De Joya, 
Perfecto,</em> and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
