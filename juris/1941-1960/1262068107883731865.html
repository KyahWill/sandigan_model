				<BR><BR><div align="justify">En una solicitud original de <em>certiorari</em>. el recurrente, acusado del 
delito de traición en la causa Criminal No. 3522 del Tribunal del Pueblo, alega 
que en 4 de Abril de 1945 a eso de las 6 de la tarde, fué arrestado por los 
miembros del CIC del Ejército de los Estados Unidos en su residencia en la Calle 
San Rafael, No. 199—A, Manila, sin mandamiento de arresto y fué llevado a las 
prisiones de Muntinglupa, Rizal; que una semana después su esposa, que se había 
trasladado a su casa-residencia en la Calle Rosario, No. 3, Ciudad de Quezon, 
fué invitada por varios miembros del CIC bajo el mando de Teniente Olves para 
presenciar el registro de su casa en la Calle San Rafael; que rehusó seguirles 
porque no llevaban un mandamiento de registro; pero como aseguraron que aún sin 
su presencia tenian que hacer de todos modos el registro, ella les acompaño; que 
a su llegada en la casa, vió que varios efectos estaban desparramados en el 
suelo entre los cuales varios documentos; que el Teniente Olves informó a ella 
que llevaba consigo algunos documentos para probar la culpabilidad de su esposo; 
que el 27 de Junio de 1946 el recurrente presentó una moción ante el Tribunal 
del Pueblo pidiendo la devolución de tales documentos alegando como razón que 
han sido obtenidos de su residencia sin mandamiento de registro, y dicho 
tribunal, con grave abuso de discreción o exceso de jurisdicción y siguiendo la 
doctrina sentada en el asunto de Alvero <em>contra</em> Dizon (76 Phil., 637) la 
denegó; que a menos que este Tribunal ordene al Procurador Especial que los 
devuelva al recurrente, sus derechos constitucionales garantizados por la 
Constituciòn quedarian violados. Y porque no tiene otro remedio sencillo, rápido 
y adecuado en el curso ordinario de la ley, pide que este Tribunal (<em>a</em>) 
anule la orden del Tribunal del Pueblo de 9 de Julio de 1946; (<em>b</em>) que 
dicho Tribunal sea requerido a ordenar la devolución al recurrente de tales 
documentos; (<em>c</em>) que se dicte una orden de interdicto prohibiendo al 
Procurador Especial a presentarlos como prueba contra el recurrente en el asunto 
de traición. Estas peticiones demuestran que los documentos son pruebas 
relevantes, además de admisibles porque no hay regla que lo impide (Model Code 
of Evidence, 87).
<p>Esta bien fundada la contención del recurrente de que la decision en la causa 
de Alvero contra Dizon 76 Phil., 637) no es aplicable al caso particular. Los 
documentos en el asunto de Alvero han sido decomisados por los miembros del CIC 
cuando el gobierno militar ejercía en todo su apogeo sus funciones de ejército 
de ocupación. En cambio, cuando se apoderaron en 11 de Abril de 1945, de los 
documentos que son objeto de esta causa, el General MacArthur en nombre del 
Gobierno de los Estados Unidos, ya habia restablecido en 27 de Febrero del mismo 
año, el Commonwealth con todos sus poderes y prerrogativas (41 Off. Gaz. 86). El 
gobierno del Commonwealth estaba ya ejerciendo todos sus poderes 
eonstitucionales y legales sin Iimitación alguna en la Ciudad de Manila. El 
Presidente ho habla suspendido las garantías constitucionales.</p>
<p>Es doctrina bien establecida en Filipinas, Estados Unidos, Inglaterra y 
Canada que la admisibilidad de los pruebas no queda afectada por la ilegalidad 
de los medios de que la parte se ha valido para obtenerlas.<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> Es doctrina seguida por muchos años "hasta 
que surgió — dijo este Tribunal en Pueblo <em>contra</em> Carlos, 47 Jur. Fil., 
660 — la funesta opinión de la mayoría en la causa de Boyd <em>vs</em>. U. S. en 
1885, que ha ejercido perniciosa influencia en muchos Estados sobre opiniones 
judiciales subsiguientes."</p>
<p>"El desarrollo de esta doctrina del asunto de Boyd <em>vs</em>. U. S. fué 
como sigue. (<em>a</em>) La causa de Boyd continuó <em>sin ponerse en tela de 
juicio</em> en su mismo tribunal durante veinte años; mientras tanto recibía 
frecuente desaprobación en los tribunales de Estado (<em>ante</em>, párrafo 
2183). (<em>b</em>) Entonces en el asunto de Adams <em>vs</em>. New York, en 
1904, fué implicitamente <em>desechada</em>. en el Tribunal Supremo Federal, y 
los precedentes ortodoxos registrados en los tribunales de Estado 
(<em>ante</em>, párrafo 2I83) fueron expresamente aprobados. (<em>c</em>) Luego, 
después de otros veinte años, en 1914, en la causa de Weeks <em>vs</em>. U. S., 
el Tribunal Supremo Federal movido en esta época no por historia errónea, sino 
por un sentimentalismo extraviado — retrocedió a la <em>doctrina original</em> 
de la causa de Boyd, pero con <em>una condición</em>. a saber, que la ilegalidad 
del registro y decomiso deberia primero haber sido directamente litigada y 
establecida mediante una moción, hecha antes del juicio, para la devolución de 
las cosas decomisadas; de modo que, después de dicha moción y sólo entonces, la 
ilegalidad podria advertirse en el juicio principal y las pruebas asi obtenidas 
deberia excluirse. * * *." Bajo la autoridad de esta doctrina de Weeks 
<em>vs</em>. U. S., y otras decisiones de la misma escuela el recurrente 
ejercita el presente recurso, pidiendo la devolucion de los documentos 
ilegalmente sacados por los miembros del CIC.</p>
<p>Concurrimos con la reclamación del recurrente de que, bajo estas garantías 
constitucionales, tenia derecho a que su casa fuese respetada, sus documentos no 
debían ser decomisados por ninguna autoridad o agente de autoridad, sin un 
mandamiento de registro debidamente expedido.</p>
<p>Estas limitaciones constitucionales, sin embargo, no, llegan hasta el extremo 
de excluir como pruebas competentes los documentos obtenidos ilegal o 
indebidamente de é1. El Reglamento de los Tribunales, Regla 123, determina 
cuáles son las pruebas que deben ser excluídas, cuáles son las admisibles y 
competentes y no clasifica como pruebas incompetentes las obtenidas ilegalmente. 
La ley fundamental señala los límites hasta dónde pueden llegar los poderes 
ejecutivo, legislative y judicial en el ejercicio de sus funciones. El ejecutivo 
no debe abusar de su poder, violando el domicilio del ciudadano o incautándose 
indebidamente de sus bienes y documentos; el legislador no debe aprobar leyes 
que hacen ilusorio lo sagrado del hogar y los tribunales deben castigar a los 
infractores de la Constitución, sin tener en cuenta si son funcionarios públicos 
o no. Como dijo el Presidente Lumpkin en Williams <em>vs</em>. State, 28 S. E., 
624:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As we understand it, the main, if not the sole, purpose of our 
constitutional inhibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures, was to 
place a salutary restriction upon the powers of government.That is to say, we 
believe the framers of the constitutions of the United States and of this and 
other states merely sought to provide against any attempt, by legislation or 
otherwise, to authorize, justify, or declare lawful, any unreasonable search or 
seizure. This wise restriction was intended to operate upon legislative bodies, 
so as to render ineffectual any effort to legalize by statute what the people 
expressly stipulated could in no event be made lawful; upon executives, so that 
no law violative of this constitutional inhibition should ever be enforced; and 
upon the judiciary, so as to render it the duty of the courts to denounce as 
unlawful every unreasonable search and seizure, whether confessedly without any 
color of authority, or sought to be justified under the guise of legislative 
sanction. For the misconduct of private persons, acting upon their individual 
responsibility and of their own volition, surely none of the three divisions of 
government is responsible. If an official, or a mere petty agent of the state, 
exceeds or abuses the authority with which he is clothed, he is to be deemed as 
acting, not for the state, but for himself only; and therefore he alone, and not 
the state, should be held accountable for his acts. If the constitutional rights 
of a citizen are invaded by a mere individual, the most that any branch of 
government can do is to afford the citizen such redress as is possible, and 
bring the wrongdoer to account for his unlawful conduct. * * *." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Creemos que los autores de la constitución filipina nunca nan tenido la más 
ligera idea de conceder immunidad penal al que viola la santidad del hogar, ni a 
cualquier Infractor de la ley criminal por el solo hecho de que las pruebas 
contra el hayan sido obtenidas ilegalmente. El procedimiento sano, justo y 
ordenado es que se castigue de acuerdo con el artículo 128 del Código Penal 
Revisado al individuo que, so capa de funcionario público, sin mandamiento de 
registro, indebidamente profana el domicilio de un ciudano y se apodera de sus 
papeles y que se castigue también a ese ciudadano si es culpable de un delito, 
no importando si la prueba de su culpabilidad ha sido obtenida ilegalmente. El 
medio empleado en la adquisición del documento no altera su valor probatorio. 
Así en Stevison vs. Earnest, 80, 111. 5l3, se dijo; "It is contemplated, and 
such ought ever to be the fact, that the records of Courts remain permanently in 
the places assigned by the law for their custody. It does not logically follow, 
however, that the records, being obtained, cannot be used as instruments of 
evidence; for the mere fact of (illegally) obtaining them does not change that 
which is written in them * * *. Suppose the presence of a witness to have been 
procured by fraud or violence, while the party thus procuring the attendance of 
the witness would be liable to severe punishment, surely that could not be urged 
against the competency of the witness. If he could not, why shall a record, 
although illegally taken from its proper place of custody and brought before the 
Court, but otherwise free from suspicion, be held incompetent?"</p>
<p>En Com. <em>vs</em>. Dana, 2 Metc., 329, el Tribunal dijo: "Admitting that 
the lottery tickets and matetials were illegally seized, still this is no legal 
objection to the admission of them in evidence. If the search warrant were 
illegal, or if the officer serving the warrant exceeded his authority, the party 
on whose complaint the warrant issued, or the officer, would be responsible for 
the wrong done. But this is no good reason for excluding the papers seized, as 
evidence, if they were pertinent to the issue, as they unquestionably were. When 
papers are offered in evidence the Court can take no notice how they were 
obtained, — whether lawfully or unlawfully, — nor would they form a collateral 
issue to determine that question."</p>
<p>El recurrente cita el caso de Burdeau <em>vs</em>. McDowell en los siguientes 
términos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ciertos libros, papeles, memoranda, etc., de la propiedad privada de 
McDowell fueron robados por ciertas personas que estaban interesadas en la 
investigación que iba a practicar el Grand Jury contra McDowell por cierta 
ofensa que se decía había cometido éste, relativa al uso fraudulento del correo. 
Estos documentos y libros fueron después entregados a Burdeau por las personas 
que los habían robado. Burdeau era el ayudante especial del Attorney-General de 
los Estados Unidos, que iba a tener la dirección y control de la prosecución 
ante el Grand Jury. McDowell trató de impedir que Burdeau utilizara dichos 
libros y documentos mediante una moción que había presentado en tal sentido. 
Burdeau se opuso a la moción, alegando que tenia derecho de usar dichos papeles. 
La Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos sostuvo la contención de Burdeau, 
diciendo;</p>
<blockquote><p>"'We knew of no constitutional principle which requires the government to 
surrender the papers under such circumstances.</p>
<p>"'The papers having come into possession of the government without a 
violation of petitioner's rights by governmental authority, we see no reason why 
the fact that individuals unconnected with the government may have wrongfully 
taken them, should prevent them from being held for use in prosecuting an 
offense where the documents are of incriminatory character.' (Burdeau 
<em>vs</em>. McDowell.) </p></blockquote>
<p>"Adoptará nuestra Corte Suprema la doctrina que se anuncia en esta decisión? 
Sometemos que esta es una mala regla de derecho, y a nuestro humilde parecer, no 
debe adoptarla nuestra Corte."</p></blockquote>
<p>El recurrente cita después decisiones de algunos Tribunales Supremos de 
Estado que no nan adoptado esta doctrina del Tribunal Supremo Federal. No es 
extraño. Cada tribunal adopta su propio criterio. Pero de los 45 Estados de la 
Unión Americana — según el Magistrado Cardozo en su decisión dictada en 1926, en 
People <em>vs</em>. Defore, 150 N. E., 585 — catorce adoptaron la doctrina 
heterodoxa de Weeks y 31 la rechazaron, y según Wigmore, en 1940, catorce años 
después, seis Estados más, 37 en total, incluyendo Hawaii y Puerto Rico la 
rechazaron, manteniendo la doctrina ortodoxa. (8 Wigmore on Evidence, 3.ª Ed., 
páginas. 5-11) Y después de considerar las varias decisiones de las dos 
escuelas, Cardozo hizo estas atinadas observaciones sobre la doctrina de 
Weeks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are confirmed in this conclusion when we reflect how far-reaching in its 
effect upon society the new consequences would be. The pettiest peace officer 
would have it in his power, through overzeal or indiscretion, to confer immunity 
upon an offender for crimes the most flagitious. A room is searched against the 
law, and the body of a murdered man is found. If the place of discovery may not 
be proved, the other circumstances may be insufficient to connect the defendant 
with the crime. The privacy of the home has been infringed, and the murderer 
goes free. Another search, once more against the law, discloses counterfeit 
money or the implements of forgery. The absence of a warrant means the freedom 
of the forger. Like instances can be multiplied."</p></blockquote>
<p>Concretémonos al caso presente. Si los documentos cuya devolución pide el 
recurrente, prueban su culpabilidad del delito de traición, ¿por qué el Estado 
tiene que devolverlos y librarle de la acusación? ¿No es esto consentir y 
convalidar el crimen? ¿No constituye una aprobación judicial de la comisión de 
dos delitos, el de violación del domicilio del acusado cometido por los miembros 
del CIC y el de traición cometido por el recurrente? Semejante práctica 
fomentaría el crimen en vez de impedir su comisión. Además, la obtención de los 
documentos no altera su valor probatorio. Si hubiera mediado un mandamiento de 
registro, los documentos serían pruebas admisibles. No hay ninguna disposición 
constitucional, ni legal que libere al acusado de toda responsabilidad criminal 
porque no hubo mandamiento de registro. La vindicta pública exige que los 
infractores de la ley penal sean castigados. Poner en libertad al culpable por 
el simple hecho de que la prueba contra é1 no ha sido obtenlda legalmente es 
sancionar judicialmente el crimen.</p>
<p>Consideremos un caso: Juan que presencia un asesinato, consigue arrebatar del 
asesino el puñal, y con el cual le ordena que se dé por arrestado y le conduce a 
la presidencia del pueblo. En el camino se encuentra con Pedro que intercede por 
el asesino; Juan, por un sentimentalismo mal comprendido, devuelve el puñal y 
ayuda al acusado a hacer desaparecer todo vestigio del crimen para no ser 
descubierto. Juan y Pedro, no solamente cometen actos indignos de buena 
ciudadania, sino que deben ser castigados por encubridores (art. 19, Cód. Pen. 
Rev.). El público nunca llegará a comprender por qué estos dos individuos deben 
ser castigados y, en cambio, un juzgado, bajo la doctrina de Weeks, puede 
ordenar la devolución del documento robado que prueba la culpabilidad de un 
acusado y dejar libre a éste y al que robó el documento.</p>
<p>Otro caso. Por su sospechosa catadura, un tal José es arrestado por dos 
policías al dirigirse a la tribuna en donde están reunidos los altos 
funcionarios del poder ejecutivo, legislativo y judicial Juntamente con los 
representantes diplomáticos de las naciones amigas para presenciar la parada del 
aniversario de la independencia; en su bolsillo encuentran una bomba que es 
capaz de volar toda la tribuna. Otros dos policías, después de enterarse del 
arresto, requisan la casa de José y encuentran documentos que revelan que él ha 
recibido órdenes de una organización extranjera para polverizar a todo el alto 
personel del gobierno en la primera oportunidad. Los policías no tienen 
mandamiento de arresto, ni mandamiento de registro. Es justo que a moción de 
José en la causa criminal seguida contra él, se ordene por el juzgado la 
devolución de los documentos que prueban su crimen? ¿No se daría aliciente al 
anarquismo con semejante practica? El juzgado desempeñaria el triste papel de 
ayudar a los que desean socavar las bases de nuestras instituciones. En U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Snyder, 278 Fed., 650, el Tribunal dijo: "To hold that no criminal 
can, in any case, be arrested and searched for the evidence and tokens of his 
crime without a warrant, would be to leave society, to a large extent, at the 
mercy of the shrewdest, the most expert, and the most depraved of criminals, 
facilitating their escape in many instances." Y en People <em>vs</em>. Mayen, 
205 Pac., 435 se dijo: "Upon what theory can it be held that such proceeding 
(for the return of the articles) is an incident of the trial, in such a sense 
that the ruling thereon goes up on appeal as part of the record and subject to 
review by the appellate court? It seems to us rather an independent proceeding 
to enforce a civil right in no way involved in the criminal case. The right of 
the defendant is not to exclude the incriminating documents from evidence, but 
to recover the possession of articles which were wrongfully taken from him. That 
right exists entirely apart from any proposed use of the property by the State 
or its agents. * * * The fallacy of the doctrine contended for by appellant is 
in assuming that the constitutional rights of the defendant are violated by 
using his private papers as evidence against him, whereas it was the invasion of 
his premises and the taking of his goods that constituted the offense 
irrespective of what was taken or what use was made of it; and the law having 
declared that the articles taken are competent and admissible evidence, 
notwithstanding the unlawful search and seizure, how can the circumstance that 
the court erred in an independent proceeding for the return of the property on 
defendant's demand add anything to or detract from the violation of the 
defendant's constitutional rights in the unlawful search and seizure?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Constitution and the laws of the land are not solicitous to aid persons 
charged with crime in their efforts to conceal or sequester evidence of their 
iniquity." (8 Wig., 37)</p></blockquote>
<p>La teoría de Weeks <em>vs</em>. U.S. que subvierte las reglas de prueba no 
es aceptable en esta jurisdicción; es contraria al sentido de justicia y a la 
ordenada y sana administración de justicia. La doctrina ortodoxa se impone por 
su consistencia probada a traves de muchísimos años. No hay que abandonarla si 
se desea que los derechos constitucionales sean respetados y no profanados. Los 
culpables deben recibir su condigno castigo, aunque las pruebas contra ellos 
hayan sido obtenidas ilegalmente.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> Y los 
que con infracción de la ley y de la Constitución se <br>apoderan indebidamente 
de tales pruebas deben también ser castigados. Asi es cómo la ley impera, 
majestuosa e incólume.</p>
<p>Se deniega la solicitud con costas.</p><em>Moran, Pres., Feria, y Padilla 
MM.</em>, están conformes. <em><br><br>Tuazon J.</em>, concur in the result.

<p>HILADO, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>I concur, but I would further support the conclusion arrived at by the 
following additional considerations:</p>In April, 1945, when the CIC Detachment 
of the United States Army made the search at petitioner's house and effected the 
seizure of his papers and effects mentioned in the majority decision, as is of 
general knowledge and within the judicial notice of this Court, fighting 
continued in Luzon; in fact, as late as June, 1945, the cannonades and shellings 
could still be clearly heard in this City of Manila, and there were still units 
of the Japanese Army resisting the liberation forces. Under such circumstances, 
the war was continuing not only technically but <em>actually</em> in the island 
of Luzon; and the military security and safety of the liberation forces demanded 
such measures as were adopted by the CIC Detachment of the United States Army in 
making said search and effecting said seizure to the end that the activities of 
pro-Japanese elements and their chances of effectively aiding the Japanese 
forces which thus still continued to resist might be brought down to a minimum 
and, if possible, entirely foiled. The difference between this case and the case 
in L-342, Alvero <em>vs</em>. Dizon, 43 Off. Gaz., 429), is, to my mind, merely 
one of degree—the principle involved is identical in both cases.<br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p>PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>Petitioner stands accused of treason before the People's Court, the 
information against him having been filed by Prosecutor Juan M. Ladaw on 
February 28, 1946.</p>
<p>Almost a year before, on April 4, 1945, at about 6;00 p.m., petitioner was 
arrested by members of the Counter Intelligence Corps of the United States army 
at his residence at 199-A San Rafael St., Manila, without any warrant of arrest, 
and taken to the Bilibid Prison at Muntinglupa, where he was detained.</p>
<p>On April 11, 1945, petitioner's wife, who transferred to their house at 3 
Rosario Drive, Quezon City, was approached by several CIC officers, headed by 
Lt. Olves, and ordered to accompany them to the house at San Rafael to witness 
the taking of documents and things belonging to petitioner. Upon hearing from 
the officers that they did not have any search warrant for the purpose, she 
refused to go with them, but after the officers told her that with or without 
her presence they would search the house at San Rafael, Mrs. Moncado decided to 
accompany them.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the house, Mrs. Moncado noticed that their belongings had 
been ransacked by American officers and that the trunks which she had kept in 
the attic and in the garage when she left the house, had been ripped open and 
their contents scattered on the floor. Lt. Olves informed Mrs. Moncado that they 
were going to take a bundle of documents and things, which were separated from 
the rest of the scattered things, because they proved the guilt of her husband. 
Mrs. Moncado protested in vain. No receipt was issued to her. Subsequently, 
after making an inventory of their belongings at San Rafael, Mrs. Moncado found 
the following things missing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>(a)</em> Passes issued by Japanese friends for the personal safety and 
couduct of the petitioner;</p>
<p><em>"(b) </em>Correspondences of the petitioner as president of the 
Neighborhood Association in Quezon City during the Japanese occupation;</p>
<p><em>"(c)</em> Correspondence of the petitioner with certain Japanese 
officers;</p>
<p><em>"(d) </em>The personal file and the love letters of Mrs. Moncado to Dr. 
Moncado and vice versa;</p>
<p><em>"(e) </em>Marriage certificate of Dr. Moncado with Mrs. Moncado issued at 
Reno, Nevada;</p>
<p><em>"(f)</em> Private correspondence and letters of Dr. Moncado to and from 
his Filipino Federation of America in Hawaii and United States;</p>
<p><em>"(g) </em>Several law books by Guevara, Albert, Francisco, Harvard 
Classics (complete set), books on diplomacy, international law;</p>
<p><em>"(h) </em>A complete collection of the 'Tribuna' compilation of the same 
during occupation until the last day of its Issuance; </p>
<p><em>"(i)</em> Complete collection of American magazines, from 1940 to 1941 — 
Los Angeles Examiner, San Francisco Chronicle, Los Angeles Evening Herald and 
newspapers edited and owned by Dr. Moncado and published in the United States; 
and National Geographic Society;</p>
<p><em>"(j)</em> Personal letters of Dr. Moncado with several members of the 
United States Senate and Congress of the United States including a picture of 
President Hoover dedicated to Dr. Moncado;</p>
<p><em>"(k)</em> Pictures with personal dedication and autograph to Dr. and Mrs. 
Moncado by actors and actresses from Hollywood, including Mary Astor, Binnie 
Barnes, Robert Montgomery, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Boris Karloff, Wallace 
Beery, William and Dick Powell, Myrna Loy, Bette Davis and Ceasar Romero;</p>
<p><em>"(l)</em> Certificate as first flighter in the Pan-American Airways and 
even several stickers Issued by Pan American Airways for passengers' 
baggage;</p>
<p><em>"(m)</em> A promissory note of Dr. Moncado for Fifty Thousand Pesos 
(P50,000) in favor of Architect Mr. Igmidio A. Marquez of Quezon City;</p>
<p><em>"(n)</em> Three (3) volumes of modern ballroom dancing by Arthur 
MacMurray of New York, pamphlets of dancing obtained by Dr. Moncado while he was 
studying dancing at Waldorf-Astoria, New York;</p>
<p><em>"(o)</em> Two (2) volumes of rhumba, zamba and tango obtained from Mexico 
and Argentina by Dr. Moncado." (Pages 3 and 4, Petition for Certiorari and 
Injunction.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 27, 1946, petitioner filed with the People's Court a motion praying 
that the return of said documents and things be ordered. The petition was denied 
on July 9, 1946.</p>
<p>Thereupon, petitioner filed with this Supreme Court on August 10, 1946, a 
petition praying that the lower court's order of July 9, 1946, be set aside, 
that said court be required to order the return of the documents and things in 
question to petitioner, and that the prosecutor be restrained from using and 
presenting them as evidence at the trial of the criminal case for treason.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to consider the questions of law raised in this case, we 
should not ignore three questions of fact raised in the answers of respondeds: 
as to the identity of the documents and things, as to whether they were taken 
from the house at San Rafael or from the house at Rosario Heights, and as to 
whether they were taken at the time of petitioner's arrest or later.</p>
<p>The fact that the return of the documents and things were opposed to in the 
lower court by the prosecutor, without disputing their identity, and that in the 
present proceeding the prosecutor admits to have them in his possession, without 
disputing their identity or correcting any error of description made by 
petitioner, convinced us that in petitioner's and respondent's minds there is no 
d isagreement on the identity in question. There should not be any doubt that 
the papers and things described and claimed by petitioner are the ones in the 
prosecutor's possession, otherwise, instead of objecting to the return on legal 
grounds, he would have alleged that such things are not in his possession, or he 
does not know where they are, or that they did not exist at all.Whether the 
things were taken at San Rafael or at Rosario Heights is compeltely immaterial. 
The fact is that the reality and existence of things and petitioner's ownership 
thereof, are undisputed, and that they were taken from a house of 
petitioner.</p>
<p>That they were taken not at the time of petitioner's arrest but much later, 
is indisputably proved by petitioner's and his wife's depositions not 
contradicted by any other evidence.</p>
<p>This case offers a conclusive evidence that fundamental ideas, rules and 
principles are in constant need of restatement if they are not to lose their 
vitality. So that they may continue radiating the sparks of their truth and 
virtue, they need the repeated pounding of intense discussion, as the metal 
hammered on the anvil. To make them glow with all their force, purity and 
splendor, they need the continuous smelting analysis and synthesis as the molten 
iron in a Bessemer furnace. Otherwise, they become rusty, decayed or relegated 
as useless scraps in the dumping ground of oblivion. What is worse, they are 
frequently replaced by their antitheses, which pose with the deceitful dazzle of 
false gods, clothed in tinsel and cellophane. The risk, always lurking at every 
turn of human life, exacts continuous vigilance. Human minds must always be kept 
well tempered and sharpened as damask swords, ready to decapitate the hydra of 
error and overthrow the gilded idols from the muddy pedestals of pretense and 
imposture.</p>
<p>May the government profit from an illegality, an unconstitutional act, or 
even a crime to serve its aims, including the loftiest? May justice be 
administered by making use of the fruits of a lawless action? If a private 
individual, when profiting from the fruits of a criminal offeHse, is punished by 
law as an accessory after the fact, why should the government or an official 
system of justice be allowed to ignore and mock the moral principle which 
condemns the individual? Is there a moral standard for the government different 
from the one by which private conduct is measured? While a private citizen is 
not allowed to violate any rule of decency and fair play, may the government 
follow a procedure which shocks the common sense of decency and fair play? If a 
person cannot enrich himself with stolen property, why should a government be 
allowed to profit and make use of property tainted by theft or robbery or 
smeared with the blood of crime?</p>
<p>The above are among the elemental questions that must be answered in this 
case, if we are not lacking the moral courage to face all the issues raised by 
the parties. Other questions concern personal liberty as affected by illegal 
detention, personal security against illegal searches and seizures, judicial 
emancipation from colonial mental attitude.</p>
<p>Respondents urge us to follow the decision ill Alvero <em>vs</em>. Dizon 
(L-342) which, besides having been rendered by a second Supreme Court, whose 
existence is violative of the Constitution, cannot olaim better merit than a 
servile adherence to a wrong legal doctrine, decorated by the halo of authority 
of courts of a former metropolis. There are minds that forget that duty of 
thinking by ourselves and of not sticking to the teachings of foreign mentors 
has become more imperative since July 4, 1946.</p>
<p>The seizure of the papers and effects in question, having been made without 
any search warrant, was and is illegal, and was effected in open violation of 
the following provisions of the Constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and 
effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no 
warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, to be determined by the Judge 
after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses 
he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the 
persons or things to be seized." (Article Ill, section 1 [3] of the 
Constitution.)</p></blockquote>
<p>"The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable except 
upon lawful order of the court or when public safety and order require 
otherwise." (Article Ill, section 1 [5] of the Constitution.)</p>
<p>The seizure was also in open violation of sections 3, 10, and 11 of Rule 122, 
which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 3. <em>Requisites for issuing search warrant.</em>—A search warrant 
shall not issue but upon probable cause to be determined by the judge or justice 
of the peace after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and 
the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be 
searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</p>
<p>"SEC. 10. <em>Receipt for the property seized.</em>—The officer seizing 
property under the warrant must give a detailed receipt for the same to the 
person on whom or in whose possession it was found, or in the absence of any 
person, must, in the presence of at least two witnesses, leave a receipt in the 
place in which he found the seized property."</p>
<p>"SEC. 11. <em>Delivery of property and inventory thereof to court.</em>— The 
officer must forthwith deliver the property to the justice of the peace or judge 
of the municipal court or of the Court of First Instance which issued the 
warrant, together with a true inventory thereof duly verified by 
oath."</p></blockquote>
<p>Even more, the illegality and unconstitutionality amounted to two.criminal 
offenses, one of them heavily punished with <em>prision correccional</em>. The 
offenses are punished by articles 128 and 130 of the Revised Penal Code, which 
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ART. 128. <em>Violation of domicile</em>.—<em>The penalty of prision 
correccional</em> in its minimum period shall be imposed upon any public officer 
or employee who, not being authorized by judicial order, shall enter any 
dwelling against the will of the owner thereof, search papers or other effects 
found therein without the previous consent of such owner, or, having 
surreptitiously entered said dwelling, and being required to leave the premises, 
shall refuse to do so.</p>
<p>"If the offense be committed in the nighttime, or if any papers or effects 
not constituting evidence of a crime be not returned immediately after the 
search made by the offender, the penalty shall be <em>prision correccional</em> 
in its medium and maximum periods."</p>
<p>"ART. 130. <em>Searching domicile without witnesses</em>.—The penalty of 
arresto mayor in its medium and maximum periods shall be imposed upon a public 
officer or employee who, in cases where a search is proper, shall search the 
domicile, papers or other belongings of any person, in the absence of the 
latter, any member of his family, or in their default. without the presence of 
two witnesses residing in the same locality."</p></blockquote>
<p>The main authority upon which respondents rely is the decision of the Supreme 
Court of the United States in Bordeau <em>vs</em>. MacDowell (256 U.S., 465), 
the same followed in the decision in Alvero <em>vs</em>. Dizon, L-342. In the 
Bordeau case, certain documents were stolen from MacDowell. Upon finding that 
the documents contained evidence of the fraudulent use of the mails by 
MacDowell, the robbers delivered them to Bordeau, in charge of the prosecution 
against MacDowell. The latter filed a motion to prevent Bordeau from using the 
documents as evidence against him. The federal Supreme Court denied the motion 
on the ground that there is no law or constitutional principle requiring the 
government to surrender papers which may have come into its possession where the 
government has not violated the constitutional rights of the petitioner. Two of 
the greatest American Justices, Justices Holmes and Brandeis, whose dissenting 
opinions, written twenty years ago, are now the guiding beacons of the Supreme 
Court of the United States, dissented, the latter sayings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"At the foundation of our civil liberty lies the principle which denies to 
government officials exceptional position before the law, and which subjects 
them to the same rules of conduct that commands to the citizen. And in the 
development of our liberty insistence upon procedural regularity has been a 
large factor. Respect for law will not be advanced by resort, in its 
enforcement, to means which shock the common man's sense of decency and fair 
play."</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking aside the great intellectual, moral and judicial prestige of the two 
dissenters, the poignant logic and rockbottom sense of truth expressed by 
Justice Brandeis is enough to completely discredit the majority doctrine in the 
Bordeau case, a doctrine that in principle and by its evil effects appears to be 
irretrievably immoral.</p>
<p>To merit respect and obedience, a government must be just. Justice cannot 
exist where the good is not distinguished from the wicked. To be just, the 
government must be good. To be good it must stick to the principles of decency 
and fair play as they are understood by a common man's sense, by universal 
conscience. Good ends do not justify foul means. No one should profit from 
crime. Principles are not to be sacrificed for any purpose. What is bad <em>per 
se</em> cannot be good because it Is done to attain a good object. No wrong is 
atoned by good Intention. These are some of the maxims through which the common 
sense of decency and fair play is manifested.</p>
<p>Reason is a fundamental characteristic of man. There is no greater miracle 
than when its first sparks scintillated in the mind of a child. What before had 
only the vegetative life of a plant or the animal life of a mollusk or frog, 
suddenly begins to wield the prodigious power of understanding and of 
intelligent grasping of the meanings and relations of the things with which he 
is In direct or remote contact through his senses. The power of understanding 
brings forth freedom of choice. This freedom develops the faculty of 
discrimination between good and evil. That discrimination Is further developed 
into a sense of justice.</p>
<p>While the advent of the astounding miracle of reason has so much kindled the 
pride of man, to the extent of symbolizing it with the fire stolen by Prometeus 
from the heavens, and of proclaiming himself as the king of the creation, man 
had taken millennia of struggles in order to develop the basic ideas which will 
insure his survival and allow him to enjoy the greatest measure of well-being 
and happiness. He soon discovered that society is an indispensable condition to 
attain his ends. As a consequence, he fought against all anti-social ideas and 
conduct and had to discover or invent and then develop the principles and 
qualities of sociability. The struggle has been long and it will have to 
continue until the end of the centuries. It is the same eternal struggle between 
truth and error, between right and wrong.</p>
<p>While man, in the multifarious ensemble of the universe, seems to be the lone 
and exclusive holder of the divine fire of reason, he has so far failed to find 
the key to always correct thinking. The solution to the failures of reason is a 
riddle yet to be unlocked. Man is easily deceived into committing blunders or 
led into the most absurd aberrations. The mysterious genes which keep 
uninterrupted the chain of heredity, while permitting the transmission of the 
best qualities and characteristics, seems to lack the power of checking and 
staving off the tendencies of atavism. In the moral ctetology, either kind of 
characteristics and qualities may be originated and developed. The inconsistency 
of respondents is thus explainable. While they would raise their brows at the 
mere insinuation that a private individual may Justifiably profit by the results 
or fruits of a criminal offense, they would not measure the government with the 
same moral standard. That the inconsistency may be explained by its genesis is 
no ground why we should surrender to it. To set two moral standards, a strict 
one for private individuals and another vitiated with laxity for the government, 
is to throw society into the abyss of legal ataxia. Anarchy and chaos will 
become inevitable. Such a double standard will necessarily be nomoctonous.</p>
<p>The idea of double moral standard is incompatible with the temper and 
idiosyncracy of social order established by our Constitution, and Is repugnant 
to its provisions. All government authority emanates from the people in whom 
sovereignty resides. The Filipino people ordained and promulgated the 
Constitution "in order to establish a government that shall embody their 
ideals." Among these Ideals are justice, democracy, the promotion of social 
justice, equal protection of the laws to everybody. Such ideals are trampled 
down by the adoption of the double moral standard which can only take its place 
in the ideology of the supporters of absolute monarchies. Theirs is the maxim 
that "the king can do no wrong." The iniquities and misery havocked by such 
maxim would need hundreds or thousands of volumes to record them. The infamy of 
Japanese occupation gave our people the bitter taste of the operation of the 
double moral standard. It is the antithesis of the golden rule. It would place 
government in a category wholly apart from humanity, notwithstanding its being a 
human institution,—an unredeemable absurdity.</p>
<p>From "Brandeis, A Free Man's Life" by Alpheus Thomas Mason (pp. 568 and 569), 
we quote an analogous legal situmtion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the famous wire-tapping case Chief Justice Taft, delivering the opinion, 
overruled the defendants' claim that the evidence obtained when government 
agents tapped their telephone wires violated either unreasonable searches and 
seizures or the constitutional protection against self-incrimination. No tapped 
wires entered their homes and offices, Taft reasoned, so there was neither 
search nor seizure,</p>
<p>"For Justice Brandeis such a narrow construction degraded our great charter 
of freedom to the level of a municipal ordinance. Quoting Chief Justice 
Marshall's famous admonition—'We must never forget that it is a Constitution we 
are expounding'—he pointed out that just as the power of Congress had by 
judicial interpretation been kept abreast of scientific progress, and extended 
the Fundamental Law to objects of which the Founding Fathers never dreamed, so 
also must the judges in construing limitations on the powers of Congress be 
evermindful of changes brought about by discovery and invention. To have a 
living Constitution, limitations on power no less than grants of power must ba 
construed broadly, 'Subtler and. more far-reaching means of invading privacy 
have become available to the government,' Brandeis observed, * * * The progress 
of science in furnishing the government with means of espionage is not likely to 
stop with wire-tapping. Ways may some day be developed by which the government, 
without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by 
which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of 
the home. * * *</p>
<p>" 'Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or ill, it 
teaches the whole people by example, crime is contagious. If the government 
becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become 
a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of 
the criminal law the end justifies the means — to declare that the government 
may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal — 
would bring terrible retribution. * * *</p>
<p>" 'The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to 
the pursuit of happiness,' he emphasized. "They recognized the significance of 
man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that 
only a part of the pain, pleasure, and satisfactions of life are to be found in 
material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their 
thoughts, their emotions, and their sensations, They conferred, as against the 
government, the right to be let alone—the most comprehensive of rights and the 
right most valued by civilized men. * * *</p>
<p>" 'Experience should teach, us to be most on our guard to protect liberty 
when the government's purposes are beneficent. Men horn to freedom are naturally 
alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest 
dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning, 
but without understanding.'" (Olmstead <em>vs</em>. U.S., 277 [U.S.] 438 [1928], 
pp. 473-474, 478, 479, 485.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The argument that goods and personal properties illegally taken, stolen, or 
snatched from the owner or possessor without a duly issued search warrant can be 
retained by the prosecution for use as evidence in a criminal case instituted is 
initiated by an original and basic flaw. The argument rests on the assumed 
existence or commission of a crime as its minor premise. But, under the orderly 
processes of law, the assumption has yet to be proved, and it is impossible to 
be proved before it can be of any use to support and clinch the argument. The 
prosecution is called upon to make the assumption that the goods and properties 
in question are evidence of a crime. To be valid, the assumption has to 
presuppose the commission or existence of the crime. That presupposition, in 
order to be valid, must in turn stand on an authoritative pronouncement which 
can only be made in a final and executory decision rendered by a court of 
justice. The prosecution cannot make a conclusive pronouncement, as to the 
existence or commission of a crime, the basic fact which, under the argument, 
will entitle the prosecution to retain and use the goods and properties in 
question. the argument assumes a fact the existence of which still remains to be 
proved and continues to be enveloped in the mists of the realm of uncertainties, 
which fact may lead to the disputed right of the prosecution to retain the goods 
and properties illegally seized as essential evidence of the crime. The line of 
reasoning that build up the argument can be restated in more abstract terms as 
follows: Justify the means by their necessity to attain an end by starting from 
the premise that the end was accomplished, such a reasoning process is 
fundamentally subversive to logic and is incompatible with the natural workings 
of the human mind.</p>
<p>The rules governing the phenomena of diffusion and osmosis, of permeability 
and isotonic equilibrium, of assimilation and waste dislodgment, of development 
and reproduction, like all laws of life, are uniform and universal, Whether in 
the nuclear chromatin or the cytosome of a single protoplasmic cell of amoeba or 
in the sinews of the heaviest marsupial, whether in the formation of the 
smallest bud or in the display of color and aroma by the most beautiful flower, 
whether in the development of a frog or in the attainment of the perfect curves 
and velvety skin of a lovely girl, the uniformity and universality of biological 
laws are manifested unrelentlessly. Any disregard of them is fatal, and will 
lead to irretrievable disaster and destruction. Moral standards are the laws of 
social life. In a different plane and order, they are but biological laws, 
governing the vital processes and functions of social organism. They are and 
should be uniform and universal and no single unit or organ of human society can 
disregard them or any one of them without alluring catastrophic 
consequences.</p>Our decision is to grant all the prayers of the petition, and 
it was so ever since February 24, 1947, when this Court took the vote for the 
disposal of this case. In stating this fact we do not want to put any blame on 
the distinguished member who penned the decision now to be promulgated. In 
justice to him, we may record that the drafting of the majority decision was 
transferred and entrusted to him many months after a final vote had been taken 
on the case. and it did not take him more than a month to have majority opinion. 
In exposing the fact we mean only to emphasize the crying need of changing a 
situation or a system of procedure that permits the promulgation of our 
decisions one year or more after a case has been submitted to us for final 
action. It is only part of the crusade to curtail judicial delay which we felt 
our duty to engage in since it had been our privilege to sit in the supre<span class="style2">me Court, whose vantage in the legal field imposes upon the members 
thereof the role of leadership in legal thought and practice for the most 
effective administration of justice.</span> <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING </em></p>
<p>BENGZON,<i> J.</i>: </p>
<p>Sanctity of the home is a by-word anywhere, anytime. The house of man was the 
first house of God.</p>
<p>In Rome the citizen's dwelling was a safe asylum. Invasion thereof was 
anathema. Down through the centuries respect for men's abodes has remained a 
heritage of civilization.</p>
<p>In England, the poorest man could in his cottage, defy all the forces of the 
Crown. "It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the 
storm may enter; the rain may enter; but the King of England may not enter; all 
his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement." His home was 
indeed his castle.</p>
<p>And in the United States: "The right of the citizen to occupy and enjoy his 
home, however mean or humble, free from arbitrary invasion and search, has for 
centuries been protected with the most solicitous care. * * * "The mere fact 
that a man is an officer, whether of high or low degree, gives him no more right 
than is possessed by the ordinary private citizen to break in upon the privacy 
of a home and subject its occupants to the indignity of a search for the 
evidence of crime, without a legal warrant procured for that purpose. No amount 
of incriminating evidence, whatever its source, will supply the place of such 
warrant. At the closed door of the home, be it palace or hovel, even bloodhounds 
must wait till the law, by authoritative process, bids it open. * * *" (McLurg 
<em>vs</em>. Brenton, 123 Iowa 368, quoted in 20 Phil. 473.)</p>
<p>Logical culmination and practical application of the above principles, 
embodied in our Organic Laws, is the ruling we announced in Alvarez <em>vs</em>. 
Court of First Instance of Tayabas, 64 Phil. 33, that documents unlawfully 
seized in a man's home must be returned — irrespective of their evidentiary 
value — provided seasonable motions are submitted. <span class="style2">We 
followed the Federal rule in Boyd <em>vs</em>. U. S. 116 U.S., 616 and many 
others. We had said before that "it is better oftentimes that crimes should go 
unpunished than that the citizen should be liable to have his premises invaded, 
his desks broken open, his private books, letters, and papers exposed to prying 
curiosity, * * * under the direction of a mere ministerial officer" * * * 
insensitive perhaps to the rights and feelings of others. (U.S. <em>vs</em>. De 
los Reyes and Esguerra, 20 Phil. 472, citing Cooley, Constitutional 
Limitations.)</span></p>
<p>In the Alvarez decision we reflected that "of all rights of a citizen few are 
of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the 
right of personal security, and that involves the exemption of his private 
affairs, books, and papers from the inspection and scrutiny of others", and 
while the power to search and seize is necessary to public welfare, still it 
must be exercised without transgressing the constitutional rights of citizens, 
because the enforcement of statutes is never sufficiently important to justify 
violation of the basic principles of government. It is agreed that the 
fundamental rights of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution, must be 
given such a liberal construction or strict construction as will be in his 
favor, to prevent gradual encroachment or stealthy depreciation of such 
fundamental rights. (State <em>vs</em>. Custer County, 198 Pac., 362; State vs. 
McDaniel 231 Pac., 965; 237 Pac. 373.)</p>
<p>Our Constitution in its Bill of Bights decrees that "the right pf the people 
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable 
searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but 
upon probable cause, to be determined by the judge after examination under oath 
or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and 
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to 
be seized". (Constitution, article III, section 1 [3].)</p>
<p>This is an improvement over the provisions of the Jones Law regarding 
warrants and seizures. It was designed to make our Constitution "conform 
entirely" to the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. (Aruego, Framing of 
the Philippine Constitution, Vol. II, p. 1043.)</p>
<p>The split between several State Supreme Courts on one side and the Federal 
Supreme Court on the other, about the admissibility of evidence obtained through 
illegal searches and seizures, was familiar to this Court (People <em>vs</em>. 
Carlos, 47 Phil. 626, 630) before it voted to adopt the Federal doctrine in 
Alvarez <em>vs</em>. Court of First Instance of Tayabas, <em>supra</em>.</p>
<p>This last doctrine, applied in several subsequent cases (People <em>vs</em>. 
Sy Juco, 64 Phil. 667; Rodriguez <em>vs</em>. Villamil, 37 Off. Gaz., 2416) was 
probably known to the Constitutional Convention that, in addition, made the 
constitutional mandate on the point more complete and explicit, <em>copying 
exactly the wording</em> of the Federal Constitution, a circumstance which, 
coupled with the citation of Boyd <em>vs</em>. U.S., showed adherence to the 
Federal doctrine that debars evidence obtained by illegal search or unlawful 
seizure.</p>
<p>It is significant that the Convention readily adopted the recommendation of 
the Committee on Bill of Rights after its Chairman had spoken, explaining the 
meaning and extent of the provision on searches and seizures and specifically 
invoking the United States decisions of Boyd <em>vs</em>. U. S. 116 U. S. 616 
and Gould <em>vs</em>. U.S. 225 U.S. 298, which the majority of this Court 
would now discard and overrule. (Aruego op. cit. Vol I, p. 160; Vol. II, pp. 
1043, 1044.)</p>
<p>Therefore, it is submitted, with all due respect, that we are not at liberty 
now to select between two conflicting theories. The selection has been made by 
the Constitutional Convention when it impliedly chose to abide by the Federal 
decisions, upholding to the limit the inviolability of man's domicil. Home! The 
tie that binds, the affection that gives life, the pause that soothes, all 
nestle there in an atmosphere of security. Remove that security and you destroy 
the home.</p>
<p>Under this new ruling the "King's forces" may now "cross the threshold of the 
ruined tenement" seize the skeleton from the family closet and rattle it in 
public, in court, to the vexation or shame of the unhappy occupants. That those 
forces may be jailed for trespass, is little consolation. That those forces may 
be pardoned by the King, their master, suggests fearful possibilities. The 
sanctuary, the castle, are gone with the wind.</p>
<p>An opinion of Mr. Justice Gardozo in the Court of Appeals of New York is 
cited as authority for the majority view (People <em>vs</em>. Defore 150 N. E., 
585). Yet it is markworthy that, in New York, protection against unreasonable 
searches and seizures is hot promised by the Constitution of the State but by a 
mere statute. (Civil Rights of Law) (See the same case, and 56 C. J., p. 1156.) 
New York is the only state that denies this privilege the status of a 
constitutional prerogative, (<em>supra</em>). Hence the precedent is obviously 
inconclusive.</p>
<p>Moreover, admitting, for purposes of argument only, that the Alvarez decision 
is legally erroneous, I maintain that the new doctrine should apply to future 
cases — not to herein petitioner who has relied on it. In Santiago and Flores 
<em>vs</em>. Valenzuela, No. L-670, April 30, 1947 (44 Off. Gaz., 3291, 3296) I 
argued for that proposition as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * the reserved right to upset previous decisions is likewise qualified 
by the proposition that such upsetting shall have prospective — not retroactive 
— effect.</p>
<p>"In Douglass vs. Pike County, 101 U.S. 677 at p. 667, it was declared, "The 
true rule (<em>of stare decisis</em>) is to give a change of judicial 
construction * * * the same effect in its operation' * * * as to 'a legislative 
amendment, i.e., make it prospective but not retroactive.'</p>
<p>"And in Great Northern R. Co. <em>vs</em>. Sunburst Oil &amp; Ref. Co., 287 
U.S. 358, the Supreme Court, through Mr. Justice Cardozo, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>" 'A state in defining the limits of adherence to precedent may make a choice 
for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation 
backward. It may say that decisions of its highest court, though later 
overruled, are law none the less for intermediate transactions. Indeed there are 
cases intimating, too broadly (cf. Tidal Oil Co. <em>vs</em>. Flanagan. 263 U. 
S. 444; 68 Law. ed., 382, 44 S. Ct. 197, <em>supra</em>), that it must give them 
that effect; but never has doubt been expressed that it may so treat them if it 
pleases, whenever injustice or hardship will thereby be averted. Gelpcke 
<em>vs</em>. Dubuque, 1 Wall ., 175; 17 Law . ed., 250; Douglass <em>vs</em>. 
Pike County, 101 U. S. 677, 687; 25 Law. ed., 968, 971; Loeb <em>vs</em>. 
Columbia Twp., 179 U. S; 472, 492, 45 Law. ed., 280, 290, 21 S. Ct., 174, 
etc.'"</p></blockquote>"This view is not unanimous, I know. However, inasmuch as one of the 
principal arguments of the opposing school of thought is that it makes the 
overruling decision a mere 'declaratory judgment', and since that objection is 
untenable in this jurisdiction where declaratory relief is permitted (Rule 66), 
the view herein advocated — future operation only — should all the more be 
acceptable to our system of jurisprudence. More about this in the future, if I 
should happen to agree to an orerruling of previous decisions and the question 
should hinge on its backward or forward application. For the present, enough to 
note some of the abundant literature on the point. <span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>" </blockquote><br>

y ciudadanas y por el temperamento ecuánime y sereno de una raza tan admirable 
como la anglosajona — se ha considerado necesario garantizar los fueros del 
ciudadano bajo la coraza de semejante doctrina, con mayor razón debemos tener y 
asegurar esas garantías en una democracia como la nuestra, joven, que apenas 
está haciendo los pinitos iniciales en el camino de la independencia politica, y 
donde la demagogia y la anarquía y las tendencias peligrosas al establecimiento 
de un régimen de fuerza podrían frustrar las bendioiones de la libertad a tanta 
costa ganada.</p>
