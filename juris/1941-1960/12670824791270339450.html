				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 20, 1953, Caltex (Philippines)&nbsp; Inc. was&nbsp; granted by the&nbsp; Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources a petroleum refining concession with the&nbsp; right to establish and operate a petroleum refinery in the municipalities of Bauan and&nbsp; Batangas,&nbsp; province&nbsp; of Batangas.&nbsp; The&nbsp; con- cession contains the&nbsp; following proviso:&nbsp; "the Government hereby also grants all the rights of a Petroleum Refining Concession and the Concessionaire&nbsp; hereby accepts all the obligations of said Petroleum Refining&nbsp; Concession in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of&nbsp; Republic Act No.&nbsp; 387 as approved 18 June 1949, the provisions of which are&nbsp; made a part&nbsp; of this Deed&nbsp; of Concession."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; constructed a petroleum refinery in the municipality of Bauan, Batangas, which was&nbsp; completed and commenced operation sometime in October,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; using as&nbsp; basic material crude oil&nbsp; imported from abroad.<br><br>On May 11, July&nbsp; 28, and September&nbsp; 11, 1954,&nbsp; the corporation filed with the Collector&nbsp; of Customs a claim for refund&nbsp; of the&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; of P9,924.31j&nbsp; P3,679.78&nbsp; and P1,300.24, representing customs&nbsp; duties paid on imported petroleum products consumed in&nbsp; connection with its re finery&nbsp; project at Bauan, Batangas, during the period from June 20,&nbsp; 1953 to March 15, 1954; from April 1, 1954 to June 30, 1954, and from March 1, 1954 to March 31, 1954, respectively, on&nbsp; the ground that the same&nbsp; were&nbsp; exempt from&nbsp; customs duties&nbsp; under Article 103 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 387.&nbsp; On April 25, 1955, the Collector&nbsp; of Customs denied&nbsp; said claim for refund&nbsp; and,&nbsp; on appeal, the Com missioner of&nbsp; Customs&nbsp; affirmed the ruling on&nbsp; August 21, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 30, 1955, the corporation filed a petition for review with&nbsp; the Court of Tax Appeals which, after&nbsp; hearing, rendered decision&nbsp; the&nbsp; dispositive part of which&nbsp; reads:<br><br><blockquote>"Wherefore, the decision of the respondent Commissioner of Customs of August 21, 1955, appealed from, should be, as it is hereby modified.<br><br>"Respondent is hereby ordered to refund to the petitioner, Caltex (Philippines)&nbsp; Inc. the&nbsp; amount of P10.444.82, representing" customs duty on the petroleum products imported by it during the period from June 24,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; to&nbsp; May 29,&nbsp; 1954, for its own use in the construction of&nbsp; its Batangas refinery,&nbsp; the collection and refusal to refund&nbsp; the same being in&nbsp; contravention of Article 103 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 387,&nbsp; without special pronouncement as to costs."<br></blockquote><br>The&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs interposed the present petition for review.<br><br>Respondent company claims exemption from&nbsp; payment of customs duties&nbsp; on its&nbsp; importation of&nbsp; petroleum products consumed by&nbsp; it during&nbsp; the&nbsp; construction&nbsp; of its&nbsp; refinery under Article&nbsp; 103 of Republic Act No. 387, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>"ART. 103. <i>Customs duties.</i>â€”During the first five years following the granting of any concession, the concessionaire may import free of customs duty, all&nbsp; equipment, machinery, material, instruments, supplies and accessories.<br><br>"No exemption shall be allowed on&nbsp; goods imported by the concessionaire for his personal use&nbsp; or that of any others; nor for sale or for re-export and if any&nbsp; goods&nbsp; on which&nbsp; exemption has been allowed be thus used or disposed of, the concessionaire is obliged to make a report&nbsp; to the Secretary&nbsp; of Agriculture and Natural Resources&nbsp; to that effect and to pay such import duty as is due."</blockquote><br>It&nbsp; would&nbsp; appear that under&nbsp; the above&nbsp; provision any concessionaire may (import free of customs duty "all equipment, machinery, material, instruments, supplies and accessories" during the first five years following the granting of the concession.&nbsp; Here&nbsp; it cannot&nbsp; be disputed that&nbsp; the petroleum products imported by respondent&nbsp; for&nbsp; its&nbsp; use during the construction of the&nbsp; refinery such&nbsp; as&nbsp; gasoline and oil furnished its drivers during the&nbsp; construction&nbsp; job come within the import of the words <span style="font-style: italic;">material </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">supplies</span>, for it has been held that gasoline and oil used by&nbsp; drivers in a construction job fall&nbsp; under&nbsp; the category of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">supplies </span>(West <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Detroit Fidelity and Surety Co., 225 N. W. 673, 678, 118&nbsp; Neb. 544&nbsp; cited on page 790 Vol. 40, Words and Phrases).&nbsp; To the&nbsp; same effect is the&nbsp; opinion rendered by the Secretary of Justice on June&nbsp; 28, 1954 upon the request of respondent who held&nbsp; that&nbsp; its&nbsp; importation of crude oil for the use of its&nbsp; refinery can be&nbsp; considered as&nbsp; "materials" within the purview of the&nbsp; exemption statute.&nbsp; It is, therefore, clear that by express provision of the law the petroleum&nbsp; products imported&nbsp; by respondent for the use of its cars during the&nbsp; construction of&nbsp; its refinery are exempt from&nbsp; the customs duties&nbsp; imposed by petitioner.<br><br>It is, however,&nbsp; contended that, regardless&nbsp; of the above interpretation, the exemption&nbsp; clause contained in the law cannot apply&nbsp; to the herein&nbsp; corporation for the reason that the refinery of the latter&nbsp; is being operated on imported crude petroleum and not on crude petroleum produced in tire Philippines, contrary,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; claimed, to&nbsp; the very objective of Republic Act No. 387 which&nbsp; is to promote and encourage&nbsp; the exploration, development,&nbsp; production and utilization&nbsp; of the petroleum resources&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines, as much as possible, by private enterprises looking toward the establishment of a wholly integrated domestic industry with an equitable division of benefits between such private enterprise and the Government, giving&nbsp; likewise a share of such benefits to the private land owners."&nbsp; And to strengthen his argument, petitioner adds the following comment:<br>"It cannot be denied that refining concessionaires cannot help in the utilization&nbsp; of our petroleum resources unless they&nbsp; refine&nbsp; locally&nbsp; produced&nbsp; crude petroleum&nbsp; products. To exempt respondent Caltex&nbsp; (Philippines) Inc. from payment of&nbsp; customs duties on its importation of equipment, machinery, material, instruments, supplies, and accessories will not only result in the loss of revenues to the government, but will also defeat the purpose of the law to&nbsp; develop, exploit and utilize the petroleum resources of the Philippines."&nbsp; In other words, the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner is that since&nbsp; respondent does&nbsp; not use in&nbsp; its refinery locally produced&nbsp; crude&nbsp; petroleum but it operates on imported crude petroleum&nbsp; products, it&nbsp; cannot claim the benefit of exemption&nbsp; granted by Republic Act 387.<br><br>Many reasons may be advanced to show that such is not the real intent of the law in granting exemption to petroleum&nbsp; concessionaires&nbsp; in the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin&nbsp; with, we may cite the&nbsp; provision of Article 79 of said Act which requires any established refinery "to refine crude petroleum produced in the Philippines in preference over any imported crude petroleum", which means that imported crude petroleum&nbsp; may&nbsp; be allowed as long as&nbsp; no crude&nbsp; petroleum is produced in the&nbsp; Philippines, and here&nbsp; it is admitted that there is no commercial production of crude petroleum in the Philippines such&nbsp; that respondent might be compelled for sometime to operate on imported&nbsp; petroleum.&nbsp; In the second place, in the&nbsp; concession&nbsp; granted to&nbsp; respondent, there is&nbsp; a proviso to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; the concessionaire shall not be required against its will to refine crude petroleum from foreign&nbsp; sources, which can only&nbsp; mean that it may also make use of petroleum from foreign&nbsp; sources if it so desires.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the third place, when the Petroleum Act was passed and the concession granted to respondent under its provision, it was well known that there&nbsp; was then no Philippine&nbsp; crude petroleum available for the use of any refinery in the Philippines which makes it&nbsp; obvious&nbsp; that Congress could not&nbsp; have intended that before the exemption may be extended to a concessionaire the latter should only refine crude&nbsp; petroleum produced in the Philippines, for that would defeat the very objective of the Act. From the practical and legal&nbsp; point of view, therefore,&nbsp; the interpretation that petitioner desires to&nbsp; give now to the law. in an effort to justify&nbsp; its denial of&nbsp; the claim for exemption by respondent&nbsp; is unfair&nbsp; and cannot be sustained.<br><br>But petitioner insists that to allow the operation of oil refineries in the Philippines on imported crude oil products would be contrary to the real objective of the Act which is to promote and&nbsp; encourage the exploration,&nbsp; development, production&nbsp; and utilization of the petroleum&nbsp; resources of the&nbsp; Philippines, and so that should&nbsp; not be countenanced. Again,&nbsp; this contention&nbsp; is&nbsp; untenable, for it overlooks the fact that with the establishment here of oil refineries those interested in&nbsp; oil exploration&nbsp; and venture&nbsp; would receive greater impetus and encouragement because of the thought that&nbsp; if they strike&nbsp; oil&nbsp; of&nbsp; commercial value they would have an already established refinery that would be ready to absorb all the crude petroleum they may produce out of their exploratory efforts.&nbsp; They would know&nbsp; then&nbsp; that in that eventuality they would not need to&nbsp; establish their own refinery, which requires a&nbsp; huge&nbsp; capital, to&nbsp; process their own produced raw&nbsp; material.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, we cannot but take notice&nbsp; of the following interesting observation of the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals,&nbsp; which&nbsp; we quote with approval:<br><br><blockquote>"We&nbsp; could&nbsp; concede that as a petroleum refining concessionaire, the petitioner herein is not contributing directly to the exploration and exploitation&nbsp; of our&nbsp; petroleum resources.&nbsp; We cannot admit, however, that as&nbsp; such&nbsp; concessionaire, the petitioner is undermining the development&nbsp; of our&nbsp; petroleum resources.&nbsp; Indirectly,&nbsp; the petitioner is contributing immeasurably to&nbsp; the exploration of our hidden and undeveloped&nbsp; oil resources.&nbsp; For one&nbsp; thing, the establishment of a petroleum refinery in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines, like the&nbsp; one operated by petitioner, has given the necessary incentive to&nbsp; those already engaged or&nbsp; who intend to engage&nbsp; in&nbsp; drilling&nbsp; oil wells in&nbsp; the Philippines as the&nbsp; Philippine Oil Development Co. and many&nbsp; others.&nbsp; Filipino capitalists&nbsp; who are&nbsp; by nature&nbsp; conservative&nbsp; and timid, would be encouraged&nbsp; to invest and&nbsp; keep&nbsp; on investing their capital in the venture with&nbsp; the assurance that&nbsp; should, they finally strike oil of commercial&nbsp; value, they would&nbsp; have ready at&nbsp; their disposal a&nbsp; well- established,&nbsp; locally&nbsp; operated&nbsp; refinery&nbsp; costing&nbsp; over P50,000,000.00 manned by experts.&nbsp; For their convenience, there will be no need for them&nbsp; to refine their crude oils abroad nor provide for themselves a refinery that would mean a drainage of capital and&nbsp; several years to construct.&nbsp; By way&nbsp; of analogy, the&nbsp; Philippine Charity Sweep stakes Office is definitely not engaged in&nbsp; breeding horses.&nbsp; However, it cannot be denied that its creation has&nbsp; given much encouragement to local horse&nbsp; fanciers,&nbsp; race&nbsp; horse owners&nbsp; and&nbsp; horse traders to breed&nbsp; good&nbsp; stock, what with&nbsp; the&nbsp; tempting prizes&nbsp; that are&nbsp; being offered&nbsp; to winners in Sweepstakes races and the&nbsp; exorbitant&nbsp; price that a potential&nbsp; Sweepstakes winner could&nbsp; command&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; horse market.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, it would be&nbsp; most unreasonable as&nbsp; respondent's counsel&nbsp; seems to&nbsp; expect, for petitioner&nbsp; to&nbsp; refine locally produced crude&nbsp; oil before granting it the&nbsp; benefit of exemption from customs duty when,&nbsp; as everybody&nbsp; knows,&nbsp; we have not yet discovered crude oils&nbsp; of commercial value in this&nbsp; country.<br><br>"The&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mines&nbsp; who&nbsp; is&nbsp; authorized under Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 387, to&nbsp; administer&nbsp; and enforce said&nbsp; law,&nbsp; in his letter of&nbsp; May 9, 1953, Exhibit&nbsp; B,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Secretary of Agriculture&nbsp; and Natural Resources recommending the approval of&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; application for a&nbsp; Petroleum Refining Concession, made the following observations:<br><br>"The establishment of a petroleum refinery in the Philippines will undoubtedly&nbsp; contribute much to the economic welfare of the nation as it will&nbsp; be an&nbsp; additional source of&nbsp; taxes for the&nbsp; Government afford&nbsp; more&nbsp; opportunities for&nbsp; employment of our people,&nbsp; and&nbsp; may reduce the cost of petroleum&nbsp; products&nbsp; which&nbsp; are&nbsp; basic needs&nbsp; and therefore essential&nbsp; in the&nbsp; progressive industrialization of our economy.&nbsp; The operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; such a refinery may also induce the intensification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the search&nbsp; for&nbsp; oil in&nbsp; the Philippines, where oil&nbsp; is recognized to exist,&nbsp; as then there will be a&nbsp; refinery available to turn into manufactured&nbsp; products the crude petroleums that may be found&nbsp; and produced locally.&nbsp; It may also be mentioned that the investment here of P60,000,000&nbsp; for&nbsp; such a refinery will constitute another evidence of the confidence of foreign investors in the soundness of the Philippine peso and the existence locally of a favorable climate for foreign investments.'" </blockquote><br>Note this observation of the Director of Mines: "The operation of such a refinery may also&nbsp; induce the intensification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; search for&nbsp; oil&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippines, where oil&nbsp; is recognized to&nbsp; exist, as then there will be&nbsp; a refinery available to turn into manufactured&nbsp; products&nbsp; the&nbsp; crude petroleums&nbsp; that may be found and produced locally."&nbsp; No greater&nbsp; encouragement can be found to bolster up&nbsp; the exploration and development of the petroleum resources of the Philippines than this comment of our technical authority on the&nbsp; matter.<br><br>It is finally contended that Republic&nbsp; Act No. 901 which grants general&nbsp; tax exemption to new&nbsp; and necessary industries&nbsp; has the effect of impliedly repealing Section&nbsp; 103 of the Petroleum Act insofar as new industries are concerned and&nbsp; since the refinery established by&nbsp; respondent may be&nbsp; considered a new industry, it may not now claim the exemption in question.&nbsp; To meet this point, suffice it to state that Section 1 of Republic Act No. 901 expressly provides that&nbsp; "the tax exemption provided&nbsp; for in this Act shall not include any company or person engaged in the processing of oil, gasoline, lubricants and other similar fuels and by-products", which shows that respondent's refinery cannot be considered a new industry under said Act.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; respondent never requested any&nbsp; exemption from taxation under Republic&nbsp; Act No. 901, nor has&nbsp; it claimed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be a&nbsp; new and&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; industry within its scope.<br><br>We find, therefore,&nbsp; untenable the&nbsp; errors attributed by petitioner to the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
