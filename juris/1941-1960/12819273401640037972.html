				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Agripino Barrion lived with his family in their house at the barrio of 
Bancoro, municipality of Taal, Province of Batangas. In the first hours of 
November 27, 1943, he noticed the presence of many persons, about fifty, in his 
yard, one of whom inquired whether he had some rope. Having replied in the 
negative, he was asked for fire to light their cigarettes; he told them to wait, 
and then he lighted a match and his gas lamps. But the persons outside forced 
the door open, and three entered the dwelling, followed by others. One of these 
immediately hit Agripino on the head with the butt of a pistol, and thereby 
floored him unconscious. His wife, Antonina Villanueva, screamed, even as her 
daughter, Primitiva, rebuked the assailants. Their attention drawn to the women, 
the intruders bound and maltreated Antonina, to force disclosure of the money 
and valuables in the household. Two others pulled Primitiva towards the room, 
taking undue liberties with her person. While resisting her captors, Primitiva 
saw and recognized the accused, Moises Benedicto, as the latter peeped through 
the door of the balcony, and later appeared at the door of the sala. Carried to 
the room, Primitiva Barrion continued to resist, until she was cuffed in the ear 
and instantly put out. After the robbers had left, the Barrions found that their 
money, jewels, and clothing, amounting to P2,770, had been taken away.</p>
<p>That same day, Agripino Barrion, his wife and daughter, went to town to 
report to the chief of police, Numeriano Manalo, before whom they subscribed the 
affidavits, Exhibits B, C and P, relating the above incidents of the robbery, 
and pointing specifically to the herein defendant, Moises Benedicto, as one of 
the bandits. The result was this criminal prosecution, culminating in a judgment 
of conviction in the Batangas court. The defendant has appealed, challenging the 
sufficiency of the evidence. In a motion for new trial, submitted to this court, 
he proposes to introduce other witnesses to corroborate his defense of 
alibi.</p>
<p>The only issue is whether appellant participated in the plunder which 
undeniably occurred at the time and place indicated.</p>
<p>We have no doubt that he did. That very morning, he was mentioned to the 
chief of police by Primitiva Barrion and her mother. They both recognized his 
face by the light of the gas lamps, having known him before as a resident of the 
neighboring barrio of Saimsim. Their testimony immediately after the event 
should be entitled to much weight, not only because of the freshness of their 
recollection, but also because such prompt denunciation excluded the probability 
of fabrication, or the couching by other persons interested against the accused. 
In the face of such identification, defendant's attempt to demonstrate an alibi 
had necessarily to fail, what with the circumstance that, at best, he proved his 
presence in a barrio of Talisay (Binirayan) at 7.30 p. m., November 26, and at 6 
the following morning, without showing it was impossible for him, in the 
interval to proceed to Bancoro and returnâ€”a distance of only two kilometers 
which, according to witnesses, could be covered by sailboat in three hours.</p>
<p>In this connection, it should be stated we deem it unnecessary to grant the 
new trial applied for. There is no assurance that the witnesses to be introduced 
could not have been presented at the original hearing. And their testimony will 
not materially improve defendant's position. It would merely establish the 
alleged fact that in the evening of November 26, the accused saw Julian Valencia 
and Fernando Maranan at a meeting of the "Federation." And without specifying 
the hour they separated, such alleged meeting could not clearly be incompatible 
with defendant's presence at Bancoro with the gang of robbers.</p>
<p>Wherefore, despite his attorney's earnest efforts to clear him, defendant 
must be declared guilty, as found by the trial judge.</p>
<p>The crime is punished by article 294, paragraph 5, of the Revised Penal Code, 
with <em>prision correctional</em> to <em>prision mayor</em> which, in this 
case, should be imposed in the maximum degree in view of the aggravating 
circumstances of dwelling and nocturnity.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and in accordance with the 
recommendation of the Solicitor General, appellant is sentenced to imprisonment 
for not less than six (6) months of <em>arresto mayor</em> nor more than ten 
(10) years of <em>prision mayor</em>, to indemnify the offended parties Agripino 
Barrion and his wife in the amount of P2,770, and to pay the costs. Thus 
modified, the appealed judgment will be affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Ozaeta, De Joya, Perfecto,</em> and <em>Bilado, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
