				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This  is  an appeal  taken  by  plaintiff from  a decision of the Court of First  Instance of Manila,  dismissing his complaint for damages on the ground  of lack of cause of action. <br><br>Plaintiff instituted the present action on May 19, 1954 against the defendant provincial fiscal of Rizal  to  recover moral and pecuniary damages in  the sum of P10,000. The complaint in substance alleges that on May 6, 1954,  the defendant fiscal conducted an investigation  of a complaint for  libel filed by herein  plaintiff against the provincial governor of Rizal and the staff members of the Philippine Free Press; that after said investigation the fiscal "rendered an  opinion" that there was no <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span>  case; that the alleged  libelous statements  were made  in good  faith and for  the sole purpose of serving  the best interests of the public;  and that  in  consequence the fiscal absolved the said governor and the Free Press staff from the crime  of libel. <br><br>The only question  for  determination  is whether plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action. <br><br>The present action is based on article 27  of the  new Civil  Code, which provides  that  "any  person suffering material or moral loss because  a public servant or employee refuses or  neglects without just cause, to perform his official duty may  file an action for damages and other relief against the  latter."  But as we said in  Bagalay <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ursal,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 50  Off. Gaz. 4231,  this article "contemplates a refusal or neglect <span style="font-style: italic;">without just cause </span>by a public servant or employee   to  perform  his  official   duty."   Refusal   of the fiscal to prosecute when after an investigation he finds no  sufficient evidence to  establish a  <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case is not a  refusal,  <span style="font-style: italic;">without just cause</span>, to perform  an  official duty.  The fiscal has for sure the legal duty to prosecute crimes  where there  is enough  evidence  to  justify such action.  But it is equally his duty not to prosecute when after an investigation he has become convinced that the evidence available is not enough  to establish a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case.   The fiscal is not bound to accept  the opinion of the complainant in  a criminal  case as to whether or not a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie </span>case  exists.  Vested with authority and discretion to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the filing of the corresponding information  and, having control of the prosecution  of  a  criminal case, the fiscal cannot be subjected to dictation from the offended party (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Liggayu, et al., 97 Phil., 865,  51 Off. Gaz., 5644; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Natoza, 100 Phil., 533, 53 Off.  Gaz., 8099). Having legal cause to refrain from filing an  information against the persons whom the herein plaintiff wants him to charge with libel, the  defendant fiscal cannot be said to have refused or  neglected without just cause to perform  his official  duty.  On the contrary,  it would appear that  he performed it. <br><br>A contrary rule would be  fraught  with  danger.   Says the learned trial Judge on this point: <br><blockquote>"Es  altamente peligroso  sentar un  precedente judicial haciendo responsable  por daños  al Fiscal  Provincial  de Rizal, aqui demandado, por rehusar este  de presentar querella si racionalmente y  de buena  fe,  dicho Fiscal  es o era  de opinion en el ejercicio de  su sana discrecion de  que no  existian  motivos para  presentar una querella; de sentar  este peligroso procedimiento o precedente judicial contra los tiscales seria poner a estos en  una situacion que  en el cumplimento de  su obligacion  y en el ejercicio de su sana discrecion estuviesen siempre  amenazados de una  demanda civil si  su opinion fuese contraria a la del denunciante,  como una  espada  de Damocles pendiente en todo tiempo sobre sus cabezas. Si el denunciante  en  aquel asunto criminal  de libelo, demandante  en la presente  causa,  no  estuviere  conforme  con la  opinion o conclusion a que ha llegado el  Fiscal Provincial de  Rizal, demandado  en esta causa,  opinion o conclusion hecha con entera buena  fe y  en  el ejercicio sano de sus  facultades discrecionales, todavia queda  al demandante otros  recursos  que  nuestras  leyes proveen para  la proteccion o ejercicio de sus derechos."</blockquote>It may not be amiss to state here that, as  a general rule, a public prosecutor, being a quasi-judicial officer empowered to exercise discretion or  judgment, is not personally liable for resulting injuries when acting within the scope of his authority, and in  the line of his official duty.   (42 Am. Jur. sec.  21 p. 256).  As was said in the case of  Mendoza vs. De Leon (33 Phil.  508,  513)—<br><blockquote>"Nor are  officers or agents of  the Government charged with the performance  of governmental  duties  which are  in  their nature legislative, or quasi judicial, liable  for the consequences of their official  acts, unless it be shown  that they act willfully  and maliciously, and with the express purpose  of inflicting injury upon the plaintiff."</blockquote>In view  of the foregoing, the decision appealed from  is affirmed,  with costs against the appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,   G.
