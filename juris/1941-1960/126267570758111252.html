				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner Quezon Ong Tan&nbsp; alias Wellington Tan&nbsp; was born&nbsp; in&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; City,&nbsp; Philippines, on June 10, 1922 (Exh/ A—Alien Certificate of Registration;&nbsp; Exh,&nbsp; B—Immigrant Certificate of Residence,&nbsp; and Exh. G—-Birth&nbsp; Certificate), of Chinese parents.&nbsp; He married Emiliana&nbsp; Go&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; B—marriage contract) who before her marriage to petitioner was a&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; citizen.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; a result of&nbsp; their&nbsp; wedlock petitioner had three&nbsp; children&nbsp; Wellington&nbsp; Tan,&nbsp; Jr., Richard&nbsp; Tan and&nbsp; Samuel&nbsp; Tan—the eldest of whom is&nbsp; G years and the youngest 4 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner has been residing&nbsp; in this&nbsp; country&nbsp; since&nbsp; birth, or for the&nbsp; last 30 odd years,&nbsp; never having&nbsp; gone out of the&nbsp; Philippines to any foreign land and intending to&nbsp; remain for the&nbsp; rest of&nbsp; his&nbsp; natural life in this country,&nbsp; he&nbsp; having no&nbsp; more relatives&nbsp; in China because his&nbsp; 6&nbsp; brothers&nbsp; and 2&nbsp; sisters, as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; his parents, are already&nbsp; living in&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; He speaks and writes English and Visayan Cebuaro dialect&nbsp; and is&nbsp; actually engaged in business as owner of the&nbsp; Lam&nbsp; Chan&nbsp; Trading Co.&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; City&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; Q), with an&nbsp; annual&nbsp; income&nbsp; of P5,000.00, more or less.&nbsp; In short,&nbsp; the record shows that&nbsp; he has&nbsp; all the qualifications prescribed by law and none of the&nbsp; disqualifications enumerated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Naturalization&nbsp; Act&nbsp; for being a&nbsp; Filipino citizen. <br><br>As stated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicant did&nbsp; not file the declaration&nbsp; of intention&nbsp; prescribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 5 of Commonwealth Act No. 473,&nbsp; for he&nbsp; claims&nbsp; to be&nbsp; exempt from such requisite for&nbsp; having been born in the&nbsp; Philippines and received his primary and secondary education in&nbsp; schools recognized by the Government and&nbsp; not limited to&nbsp; any race or&nbsp; nationality and resided continuously in the Philippines for a period of more&nbsp; than 30 years before filing his application&nbsp; herein. <br><br>After the usual court proceedings the case was heard in the Court of First Instance of Cebu where the petition for naturalization was filed on September 30,&nbsp; 1952, after which the&nbsp; Court rendered&nbsp; decision&nbsp; the dispositive part of&nbsp; which&nbsp; is as&nbsp; follows: <br><blockquote>"In View Thereof, and&nbsp; it appearing that notwithstanding the publication&nbsp; of this petition&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Official&nbsp; Gazette&nbsp; (Exh. E— Certificate&nbsp; of publication) as well as in the&nbsp; local newspaper 'La Prensa', of general circulation in&nbsp; the City of Cebu and&nbsp; elsewhere.&nbsp; (Exh. F-affidavit of publication; Exhs. F-1 to F-3, corresponding newspaper&nbsp; clipping's), nobody has&nbsp; appeared&nbsp; to&nbsp; contest the same, except the Provincial Fiscal on behalf of the Solicitor General, this Court hereby declares petitioner Quezon&nbsp; Ong Tan alias Wellington Tan a citizen of the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; This order or pronouncement, however,&nbsp; shall not be executory until&nbsp; after the (lapse of)&nbsp; two&nbsp; (2) years&nbsp; from its promulgation, and the Court, on proper hearing, with attendance of the&nbsp; Solicitor General or his representative,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have satisfied and&nbsp; so finds that&nbsp; during&nbsp; said intervening&nbsp; time said applicant&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; has&nbsp; not left the&nbsp; Philippines;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; has&nbsp; dedicated&nbsp; himself&nbsp; continuously&nbsp; to a lawful calling&nbsp; or profession; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; has&nbsp; not been convicted&nbsp; of any offense&nbsp; or violation&nbsp; of Government promulgated&nbsp; rules; nor (4)&nbsp; committed an&nbsp; act prejudicial to&nbsp; the interests&nbsp; of the nation&nbsp;&nbsp; or contrary to any&nbsp; Government announced policies."</blockquote> From this decision the Solicitor General appealed, maintaining that the&nbsp; lower Court&nbsp; erred: <br><blockquote><ol><li> In&nbsp; not&nbsp; finding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner-appellee&nbsp; has&nbsp; failed&nbsp;&nbsp; to comply with the&nbsp; prerequisite of filing a declaration of intention to become a citizen&nbsp; of the Philippines in accordance with&nbsp; Section 5&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Naturalization&nbsp; Law&nbsp; (Commonwealth Act No. 47S);&nbsp; and <br></li><li>&nbsp; In granting&nbsp; Philippine citizenship to&nbsp; the herein petitioner- appellee. </li></ol></blockquote>After&nbsp; counsel for petitioner-appellee had submitted his brief&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case, he&nbsp; filed on&nbsp; August 29, 1956,&nbsp; a motion to dismiss the appeal&nbsp; and for affirmance of the&nbsp; judgment of&nbsp; the lower Court, alleging&nbsp; that&nbsp; on August&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1956, petitioner filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; declaration of intention with&nbsp; the office of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp; General&nbsp; (Annex A), thus&nbsp; causing the ground of the&nbsp; appeal to&nbsp; become&nbsp; purely academic.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; opposed&nbsp; by the&nbsp;&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp; General on the ground that according to law said&nbsp; declaration&nbsp; of&nbsp; intention should have&nbsp; been filed&nbsp; "one&nbsp; year prior&nbsp; to the&nbsp; filing of his petition&nbsp; for admission&nbsp; to&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; citizenship", and&nbsp; that the belated filing&nbsp; of said&nbsp; declaration&nbsp; of&nbsp; intention could not cure the defect of his petition for naturalization.&nbsp;&nbsp; By&nbsp; resolution of September 17,&nbsp; 1956, this&nbsp; Court resolved to defer&nbsp; action on this point&nbsp; until consideration of the case&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; merits.<br><br>The&nbsp; solution&nbsp; of this&nbsp; case depends&nbsp; on&nbsp; Our&nbsp; determination of the&nbsp; only&nbsp; question&nbsp; at&nbsp; issue&nbsp; in this&nbsp; appeal, i.e., of whether,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the circumstances appearing of&nbsp; record, petitioner is or is&nbsp; not exempt&nbsp; from filing the&nbsp; declaration of intention prescribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 473.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 6 of this Act reads&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 6. PERSONS EXEMPT FROM REQUIREMENT TO MAKE A DECLARATION OF&nbsp; INTENTION.—Persons&nbsp; <i>born in&nbsp; the Philippines and have&nbsp; received their&nbsp; primary&nbsp; and secondary education&nbsp; in&nbsp; public schools&nbsp; or those&nbsp; recognized by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; and not&nbsp; limited to any race or nationality, and those who have resided continuously in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines for&nbsp; a period of&nbsp; thirty years or more before filing their application, may&nbsp; be naturalised without having&nbsp; to make,&nbsp; a&nbsp; declaration of intention upon&nbsp; complying with the other&nbsp; requirements of this Act.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; To such requirements&nbsp; <i>shall&nbsp; be added&nbsp; that which establishes&nbsp; that the applicant has given primary and secondary&nbsp; education to all his&nbsp; children in the public schools or&nbsp; in private schools&nbsp; recognized by&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Government and&nbsp; not limited&nbsp; to any race or nationality</i>.&nbsp; The&nbsp; same children of an alien who has declaied his intention to become a citizen&nbsp; of the Philippines and dies before he&nbsp; is actually naturalized.&nbsp; (As&nbsp; amended by&nbsp; Commonwealth. Act No. 535)" </blockquote>The&nbsp; petitioner himself states&nbsp; in his&nbsp; petition&nbsp; that&nbsp; he has filed no&nbsp; declaration of&nbsp; intention because&nbsp; he is exempt therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Solicitor General, however,&nbsp; submits:<br><blockquote>"That he is not among&nbsp; those&nbsp; exempted from filing a declaration of intention, for it is&nbsp; obvious&nbsp; that there was no compliance with the additional&nbsp; requirement of school&nbsp; enrollment of <i>all</i> his children, as stated above.&nbsp; It may be argued, however, how&nbsp; can petitioner- appellee enroll his&nbsp; children&nbsp; when&nbsp; they are not yet&nbsp; of school age? One answer&nbsp; is that the law does not&nbsp; concede any&nbsp; exception and, therefore, petitioner-appellee is not exempted to make a declaration of&nbsp; intention&nbsp; (Sec. 6). </blockquote>In&nbsp; other words,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; contention of the oppositor that&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; duty&nbsp; bound to&nbsp; file the declaration&nbsp; of intention because he&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; state&nbsp; in the application&nbsp; that he&nbsp; has&nbsp; given&nbsp; primary&nbsp; and&nbsp; secondary&nbsp; education&nbsp; to all his children&nbsp; in the&nbsp; public schools&nbsp; or in&nbsp; private&nbsp; schools recognized&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; and&nbsp; not&nbsp; limited&nbsp; to&nbsp; any<br><br>race or nationality,&nbsp; for that is&nbsp; not the case with him. This contention is far from being tenable,&nbsp; for&nbsp; counsel for the oppositor forgets&nbsp; that the <i>additional requirement</i> of said Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Act, "which establishes that&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp; has&nbsp; given&nbsp; primary&nbsp; and secondary&nbsp; education&nbsp; to all&nbsp; his&nbsp; children in&nbsp; the&nbsp; public schools, etc."&nbsp;&nbsp; refers only to children&nbsp; of <i>school age</i>, as made clear in&nbsp; Section 2,&nbsp; paragraph 6&nbsp; of said Act.&nbsp; The Solicitor General cites&nbsp; numerous decisions of this Court to strengthen his arguments, but&nbsp; all&nbsp; said decisions&nbsp; lay down general principles that are to be followed in naturalization cases, but none of them is in&nbsp; point to the facts under&nbsp; consideration. <br><br>During the deliberation of this ease one of the members&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court noted&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petitioner identifies&nbsp; himself as Quezon Ong Tan alias Wellington Tan, and remarked that under&nbsp; the law&nbsp; the&nbsp; unauthorized use of aliases is forbidden&nbsp; and&nbsp; penalized.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 1&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 142 prescribes: <br><br>"Section 1.&nbsp; Except&nbsp; as&nbsp; pseudonyms&nbsp; for literary&nbsp; purposes,&nbsp; no person shall&nbsp; use&nbsp; any name&nbsp; different from the one&nbsp; with which&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; christened or by which he&nbsp; has been known since his childhood; or such substitute name as may have been authorized by a competent court.&nbsp; The name&nbsp; shall comprise&nbsp; the&nbsp; patronymic&nbsp; name&nbsp; and one&nbsp; or two surnames." The Civil Code also provides: <br><blockquote>"Art. 379. The employment&nbsp; of&nbsp; pen&nbsp; names or&nbsp; stage names&nbsp; is permitted, provided it is done in&nbsp; good faith and there is&nbsp; no injury to&nbsp; third&nbsp; persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pen&nbsp; names and stage names cannot be usurped." <br><br>"Art. 380. Except as provided in the preceding article, no person shall use&nbsp; different names and surnames." The&nbsp; Solicitor General has not objected to&nbsp; the use by petitioner of his aforementioned&nbsp; alias and the record does not&nbsp; shed any&nbsp; light&nbsp; as to whether&nbsp; the use&nbsp; of said&nbsp; alias was duly&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; or&nbsp; not; so&nbsp; We&nbsp; cannot under the circumstances&nbsp; declare that the&nbsp; use&nbsp; by&nbsp; petitioner of the alias&nbsp; "Wellington. Tan" is proper&nbsp; or improper. </blockquote>Considering&nbsp; the conclusion&nbsp; arrived at in this&nbsp; case, We do not need to pass&nbsp; upon petitioner's&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss the appeal. <br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed. We order, however,&nbsp; that&nbsp; when letters&nbsp; of citizenship be issued to the petitioner, the same&nbsp; should be in the name of&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; Ong&nbsp; Tan only, which&nbsp; is considered sufficient to identify him.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so&nbsp; ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Conception, </i>Reyes,&nbsp; J.
