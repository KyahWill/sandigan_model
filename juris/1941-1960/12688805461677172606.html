				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The sole question presented for our decision involves the applicability of 
the debt moratorium, Executive Order No. 25 as amended by Executive Order No. 
32, to execution of monetary judgments in actions brought under the Workmen's 
Compensation Act. The petitioners obtained such judgment, which is now Anal, 
against Bartolome San Diego, one of the respondents herein, and moved for its 
execution, San Diego pleaded the Moratorium Order, and the Honorable Sotero 
Rodas, judge, denied the motion.
<p>The pertinent provision of Executive Order No. 32 amending Executive Order 
No. 25 is as follows: "Enforcement of payment of all debts and other monetary 
obligations payable within the Philippines, except debts and other monetary 
obligations entered into in any area after declaration by Presidential 
Proclamation that such area has been freed from enemy occupation and control, is 
temporarily suspended pending action by the Commonwealth Government."</p>
<p>That this provision suspends execution of judgments for money is now settled. 
(Palacios <i>vs</i>. Daza and Provincial Government of Batangas, 75 Phil., 279; 
Tarnate <i>vs</i>. Daza, 76 Phil., 853.) That it excludes from its operation 
obligations arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act in favor of employees 
for physical injuries sustained in the line of duty and other labor accidents is 
untenable. Executive Order No. 32 is very comprehensive and evinces no intent to 
make any exceptions, save as to the time the debt was incurred. It is plain and 
unambiguous leaving no occasion for construction. A cursory reading thereof 
brings the inescapable conclusion that it embraces "all debts and other monetary 
obligations" regardless of their source, or the indigence of the creditor, or 
the opulence of the debtor and his ability to pay. Deeply sympathizing with the 
petitioners, the courts can not lend them a helping hand. Their remedy lies 
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The petition is denied without costs.</p><i>Paras, Bengzon, Hontiveros,</i>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I find it impossible to reconcile my views with those expressed in the 
majority opinion. I take it that the Workmen's Compensation Act was enacted in 
pursuance of the principle of social justice enunciated in Article II, section 5 
of the Constitution. Said law was placed in the statute books for the execution 
of the national policy "to insure the well-being and economic security of all 
the people," in the words of the afore-cited constitutional provision, having 
regard to the fact that the workman is an essential and indispensable factor in 
the economic development and welfare of the nation, the amelioration of whose 
lot was deemed by the framers to be a peremptory necessity due to his centuries 
of relegation to a position of social abandonment and oblivion. Article II of 
the Constitution is entitled "Declaration of Principles," and it would seem that 
the provision of its section 5 for the promotion of social justice is in itself 
a declaration of the people's national policy in the matter. And in the absence 
of a convincing showing to the contrary, the President of the Philippines, in 
promulgating the moratorium executive orders, should not be taken to have 
intended to deviate from that national policy—which he could not 
constitutionally do anyway—much less to nullify the beneficent provisions of the 
Workmen's Compensation Act which, in its section 32, establishes priority in 
favor of actions thereunder over others, excepting only <i>habeas corpus</i> 
cases, election contests, and criminal cases wherein the accused are detained, 
and in its section 34, confers the same priority upon the compensation therein 
provided for over other credits against the employer that the law gives to due 
and unpaid wages.—This in the first place.</p>
<p>In the second, under the doctrine laid down in Tarnate <i>vs</i>. Daza (76 
Phil., 853), and the rules, hereinbelow cited, regarding judgments as 
constituting debts or obligations, those herein involved and owed by the 
respondent Bartolome San Diego to the several petitioners in each of the three 
above-entitled cases consisted in the judgment of this Court itself promulgated 
on December 17, 1946. In Tarnate <i>vs</i>. Daza, <i>supra</i>, it was said by 
this Court, with all the ten Justices present voting unanimously, that the 
obligation in favor of Vicente A. Tarnate therein considered was "created * * * 
by the order of Judge Modesto Castillo dated April 18, 1944," ordering "the 
heirs of the intestate of Paula Agoncillo to pay to the respondent Vicente A. 
Tarnate, in equal parts, the sum of P1,204," and it was there held that the 
obligation was covered by the amendatory moratorium order, Executive Order No. 
32, dated March 10, 1945. In the instant case, following said holding, the 
obligation was created by the judgment of this Court of December 17, 1946, when 
the entire Philippines had already been liberated, for which reason the said 
obligation was not covered by the aforementioned executive order. That the said 
judgment became the "debt" of the employer to the dependents of his deceased 
employees by the principle that a judgment, particularly a money judgment, is a 
debt, and the other principle of the merger in the judgment of the original 
cause of action, after which merger the old debt ceases to exist and <i>the new 
judgment debt takes its place</i>, is solidly supported by the authorities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 144. <i>Judgment as debt</i>.—A judgment has been described as a debt, 
indebtedness, or evidence of indebtedness, as a debt of record, or as a security 
of record showing a debt due from one person to another. In some cases, it has 
been declared that a judgment is a higher form of the debt on which the action 
is brought." (30 Am. Jur., 896.)</p>
<p>"According to the views of Blackstone, a judgment constitutes a debt." 
(Powell <i>vs</i>. Oregonian R. Co., [CC], 13 Sawy, 535; 36 F., 726; 2 L. R. A., 
270 [Note 10, p. 896, 30 Am. Jur.].)</p>
<p>"SEC. 150. <i>Generally</i>.—One effect of a judgment is to merge therein the 
cause of action on which the action is brought, from the date of the judgment, * 
* *." (30 Am. Jur., 903.)</p>
<p>"SEC. 158. <i>Effect of doctrine</i>.—Upon the merger of a cause of action in 
a judgment, the old debt ceases to exist and the new judgment debt takes its 
place." (30 Am. Jur., 906.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The above rules find their counterpart in article 1971 of the Civil Code. 
This article speaks of the period of prescription of actions for the enforcement 
of obligations <i>reduced to judgment</i> as commencing from the day the 
judgment became final; which clearly indicates that the judgment thus rendered 
creates an <i>obligation as of the day the judgment becomes final</i>, which is 
substantially the same as the principle of merger of the cause of action in the 
judgment in the Anglo-American law.</p>
<p>In the third place, the very nature of the claims involved in these 
compensation cases militates against their being considered as "debt and other 
monetary obligations", within the meaning of Executive Order No. 32, before they 
were reduced to judgment. In the cases at bar, the claims for compensation made 
by the dependents of the deceased workmen and the subject of the respective 
cases pending in the courts upon the promulgation of the executive order, were 
<i>unliquidated</i> until the final judgment was rendered. In other words, the 
employer could not be required to pay any amount until the rendition of the 
final judgment, for up to that time he did not know what amount to pay for the 
simple reason that the amount depended upon many factors which had to be 
considered and appreciated in the judgment, there being no agreement between the 
parties (<i>a</i>) that he was bound to pay and (<i>b</i>) as to the amount he 
should pay. The case was unlike one, for example, involving a debt of a definite 
amount under a contract of Joan with or without interest, or a case of a debt 
after <i>account stated</i> without any dispute between creditor and debtor 
respecting the accuracy of the statement, etc.</p>
<p>In the fourth place, in our above cited decision of December 17, 1946 (77 
Phil., 730), with all the ten Justices present concurring, we held that 
compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act "is an item in the cost of 
production which must be included in the budget of any well-managed industry." 
Under this, the owner of the industry is supposed and expected to include such 
item in his budget from time to time, and naturally he is supposed and expected 
to do so in adequate amounts, no less than in his provision for the other 
expenses of his trade. If so, it is an item which should not be deemed included 
in the moratorium order.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing considerations, I vote to grant the petition.</p>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The facts in this case are clearly stated in the following paragraphs of 
respondent's memorandum dated May 28, 1947:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Respondent Bartolome San Diego was the owner of two fishing boats known as 
the 'M/S Bartolome S' and 'M/S San Diego II.' Petitioner Dionisia Abueg in case 
No. G. R. No. L-1419 is the widow of the deceased Amado Nuñez who was a 
machinist on board of the 'M/S San Diego II.' Petitioner M. C. de Salvacion in 
case No. G. R. L-1420 is the widow of the deceased Victoriano Salvacion, who was 
also a machinist on board the 'M/S San Diego II'. Petitioner Rosario Oching in 
G. R. No. L-1421 is the widow of the deceased Francisco Oching who was the 
patron of the 'M/S Bartolome S'. On October 1, 1941, while the above-named 
fishing boats were engaged in fishing operations around Mindoro Island they were 
caught by a typhoon, as a consequence of which they were sunk. Petitioner's 
respective decedents Amado Nuñez, Victoriano Salvacion and Francisco Oching 
perished in the calamity. The two fishing boats were not covered by any 
insurance.</p>
<p>"On refusal of the respondent Bartolome San Diego to pay petitioners' 
demands, these actions were commenced in the Court of First Instance of Manila. 
Respondent Bartolome San Diego defended himself, mainly, on the ground that he 
was not liable on petitioners' claim because of the total loss of the 
vessels.</p>
<p>"On agreement of the parties, the above entitled cases were consolidated and 
on motion for judgment on the pleadings, a single judgment was rendered by the 
trial court in favor of petitioners and against the respondent Bartolome San 
Diego. The latter filed his notice of appeal and, pursuant thereto, the original 
records of these cases were forwarded to the Court of Appeals which, in turn, 
forwarded them to this Honorable Court for the reason that only questions of law 
were involved.</p>
<p>"While these cases were on file with this Honorable Court, the records were 
destroyed during the battle for the liberation of Manila. On petition of counsel 
for petitioners, the records of these cases were deemed reconstituted by 
resolution of this Honorable Court of April 29, 1946.</p>
<p>"On December 17, 1946, this Honorable Court rendered a decision against 
respondent Bartolome San Diego, affirming the judgment of the lower court, with 
costs.</p>
<p>"On February 28, 1947, counsel for respondent filed a petition for execution 
of judgment in the Court of First Instance of Manila, which petition was granted 
by an older of said Court of First Instance dated March 14, 1947.</p>
<p>"On March 20, 1947, counsel for Bartolome San Diego filed a motion for 
reconsideration to set aside the order of execution of judgment issued by the 
Court of First Instance of Manila, invoking the provisions of Executive Order 
No. 25, as amended by Executive Order No. 32, which declares a debt 
moratorium.</p>
<p>"On March 25, 1947, respondent, the Honorable Judge Sotero Rodas of the Court 
of First Instance of Manila, issued an order granting the motion for 
reconsideration of Bartolome San Diego dated March 20, 1947, in which order set 
aside and revoked the previous order of March 14, 1947, ordering the execution 
of the judgment, based on the provisions of debt moratorium declared under 
Executive Order No. 25, as amended by Executive Order No. 32.</p>
<p>"This order of respondent, the Honorable Judge Sotero Rodas of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila dated March 25, 1947 is the one sought to be reviewed 
by petitioners in this petition for certiorari."</p></blockquote>
<p>The three consolidated cases, CA-Nos. 773, 774, 775, which were decided by us 
on December 17, 1946 (77 Phil., 730), were finally submitted to us for decision 
upon memoranda filed by the parties, the last one by plaintiffs-appellees on 
July 24, 1946, which was filed in answer to the memorandum for 
defendant-appellant filed on July 5, 1946.</p>
<p>The petition for reconstitution was filed by plaintiffs-appellees on January 
8, 1946. A hearing for reconstitution was set on March 22, 1946, all parties 
having been notified. On March 25, 1946, appellees moved that appellant be 
ordered to produce and to present copy of appellee's brief which was furnished 
him and that in the event that no such copy could be produced, appellees be 
permitted to file again their brief. On March 28, 1946, appellant answered that 
he was agreeable to the filing by plaintiffs-appellees of a new brief, as no 
copy of the first brief can be filed.</p>
<p>On April 29, 1946, the case was declared duly reconstituted, and at the name 
time plaintiffs-appellees were authorized to file a new brief, which was done on 
May 9, 1946.</p>
<p>On May 10, 1946, appellant prayed that he be permitted to withdraw the copy 
of his printed brief, presented for reconstitution purposes, so as to be able to 
print additional copies thereof. The petition was granted on May 15. On June 20, 
1946, appellant moved to be authorized to file a memorandum within 15 days, 
which motion was granted on June 24. An 11-page memorandum was filed.</p>
<p>The several steps taken for the reconstitution of the combined three cases 
are mentioned to show that if defendant-appellant Bartolome San Diego wanted to 
avail himself of the benefits of the debt <i>moratorium</i> decreed in Executive 
Order No. 25, as amended by Executive Order No. 32, he had plenty of time and 
opportunity to do so. Of course, he could not have invoked the debt 
<i>moratorium</i> in his brief, which was filed before the executive orders 
decreeing it were issued, but when this case was reconstituted and when San 
Diego filed his memorandum on July 5, 1946, he could have invoked the debt 
<i>moratorium</i> and opposed the decision of the case. He chose instead to have 
the case decided as we finally did on December 17, 1946. He did not even move 
for the reconsideration of the decision, which he allowed to become final and 
executory without any delay. Entry of judgment was made on January 3, 1947, and 
days after the records were remanded to the Court of First Instance of Manila 
for execution of the judgment.</p>
<p>Only after the lower court ordered the issuance of a writ of execution on 
March 14, 1947, did San Diego invoke for the first time the debt 
<i>moratorium</i> in his motion, filed on March 20, 1947, to set aside the order 
of execution.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that the lower court erred in setting aside its order to 
execute the judgment. Bartolome San Diego cannot invoke the benefits of the debt 
<i>moratorium</i> provided by Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32 on two grounds: 
First, because the debt <i>moratorium</i> does not apply to obligations created 
by law, such as the compensation provided in the Workmen's Compensation Act No. 
3428, license fees, etc., and second, that, even if San Diego was entitled to 
invoke the benefits of said debt moratorium, he waived such right when he 
submitted the cases for our final decision without raising said defense.</p>
<p>The enforcement of the obligations created by law cannot be suspended or 
cancelled without repealing the corresponding provisions of law, and there is 
nothing in Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32, providing for such repeal. Implied 
repeal cannot be supposed, much less in the case of workmen's compensation. 
Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 32 were issued to minimize the sufferings of the 
less fortunate, and workmen's compensation has been provided as a measure of 
social justice to improve the economic situation of the financial underdogs, the 
laborers.</p>For all the foregoing, we are of opinion that the order of the 
lower court dated March 25, 1947, be set aside and execution of the judgment be 
undertaken under the order of said court dated March 14, 1947.</div>
