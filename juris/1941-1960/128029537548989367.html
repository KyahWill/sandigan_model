				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant was charged with and convicted of parricide or having killed his 
wife, Mercedes Grospe.
<p>He pleaded guilty to the information but took the witness stand to establish 
mitigating circumstances. After declaring that he killed his wife on the evening 
of August 26, 1946, because he caught her in the act of adultery with one 
Asuerto Soncuan, the court ordered that his plea of guilty be withdrawn and that 
a plea of not guilty be entered, and required the prosecution to present its 
evidence.</p>
<p>The prosecution proved the following facts by the testimony of several 
witnesses:</p>
<p>The spouses Juan de los Santos, 30, and Mercedes Grospe, 35, who were 
childless, lived in their house in the barrio of Tres Reyes, municipality of 
Santiago, Isabela, together with Felicisimo Grospe, brother of Mercedes, and his 
wife Pelisa Siembre. They had as their closest neighbor Alfredo Grospe, another 
brother of Mercedes, and farther away but nearer Alfredo's house was that of 
Asuerto Soncuan. On the morning of Monday, August 26, 1946, Felicisimo Grospe 
and his wife, together with Asuerto Soncuan, went to the poblacion of Santiago, 
18 kilometers from the barrio of Tres Reyes, to mill their corn.</p>
<p>Not long before 7:30 in the evening of August 26, 1946, Alfredo Grospe called 
at the house of his sister Mercedes to get some viands. He found her and her 
husband quarreling, and after hearing what they were quarreling about, he said 
he withdrew and did not get the viands any more because he felt embarrassed. 
Mercedes wanted the accused, who had no work, to join her brother Alfredo in the 
business of cutting logs, but the accused resented the suggestion and asked her, 
"Am I a boy to be taught? Can I not find a living for me?" About 7:30 Alfredo 
heard his sister Mercedes scream, "Ananay!" an Ilocano expression of intense 
pain. Alfredo rushed to the house of his sister and saw the accused hacking 
Mercedes with a bolo. Frightened, Alfredo ran to the house of the barrio 
lieutenant, Leopoldo Tomas, for succor. Leopoldo Tomas gathered special 
policemen of the barrio and went to the scene of the trouble. They surrounded 
the house of the accused and did not dare go up because Alfredo Grospe informed 
Leopoldo Tomas that the rifle of Felicisimo Grospe was in the house and they 
were afraid the accused might shoot them. At daybreak they went up the house and 
found Mercedes dead with eight bolo wounds in vital parts of the body. The 
accused had fled.</p>
<p>The barrio lieutenant and his policemen instituted a hunt for the accused. A 
week later they met him on the road with the same bolo with which he had killed 
his wife. According to Leopoldo Tomas, he approached the accused and asked him, 
"What did you do, Uncle?" and the accused answered, "I killed your aunt because 
she was trying to send me away." The accused is a cousin of Leopoldo Tomas' 
father. Leopoldo Tomas told the accused to lay down his bolo, but instead of 
doing so the accused struck him with it. Leopoldo parried the blow with the 
shotgun he was then carrying and one of his companions, Aureliano Corpuz, shot 
the accused and hit his toes. Thus they were able to subdue him and bring him to 
justice.</p>
<p>The accused again took the witness stand in his defense and testified 
substantially as follows: I am legally married to Mercedes Grospe, who is now 
dead because I killed her for having sustained illicit relations with another 
man, Asuerto Soncuan. Upon arriving home from the place where I worked on the 
farm, I found the man lying on top of my wife. I struck at him with my bolo but 
the blow landed on my wife because he jumped out of the house. "At the moment I 
saw that the man was making the coitus movement, I raised up my bolo to slash 
Soncuan, but it so happened that the bolo landed on my wife and Soncuan jumped 
out."</p>
<p>No other witness testified for the defense. In the prosecution proved by the 
testimony of Felicisimo Grospe, Asuerto Soncuan, and Justo Gonzaga that on the 
night in question Asuerto Soncuan was with Felicisimo Grospe and the latter's 
wife in the poblacion of Santiago, where they had gone to have their corn milled 
at the mill of a Chinaman, and that they did not return to the barrio of Tres 
Reyes until the following morning, when on their way home they met Justo 
Gonzaga, who informed them that Mercedes Grospe had been killed by her husband 
Asuerto Soncuan, 21, single, emphatically denied having ever had any illicit 
relation with the deceased.</p>
<p>After a careful perusal of the evidence, we are thoroughly convinced that the 
trial judge did not err in not believing the story of the accused. It is 
inherently incredible. If, as the accused said, upon entering the sala of his 
house he surprised Soncuan on top of his wife in the act of carnal intercourse 
and that he immediately struck him with a bolo, it is difficult to believe that 
the supposed adulterer could have escaped unhurt. Moreover, the fact that after 
killing his wife the accused fled and hid himself from the authorities instead 
of presenting himself to them and denouncing the supposed adulterer and the 
further fact that he resisted arrest and had to be subdued by force, are not 
compatible with his innocence. There is no reason to doubt the testimony of 
appellant's nephew Leopoldo Tomas to the effect that appellant told him that he 
had killed his wife because she was trying to drive him away from the conjugal 
home. We find from the evidence that the killing arose out of a quarrel between 
the spouses.</p>
<p>The crime of parricide is penalized by article 246 of the Revised Penal Code 
with <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death. The trial court considered in favor 
of the accused two mitigating circumstances—provocation and obfuscation—and 
imposed a penalty one degree lower than that of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to 
death. That is error. Article 63 provides in part that when the penalty 
prescribed by law is composed of two indivisible penalties, and the commission 
of the act is attended by some mitigating circumstance without any aggravating 
circumstance, the lesser penalty shall be applied, which in this case is 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em>. Having arisen from one and the same cause, the 
mitigating circumstances of provocation and obfuscation cannot be considered as 
two distinct and separate circumstances but should be treated as only one.</p>
<p>Modifying the sentence appealed from, the appellant is hereby sentenced to 
suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in 
the sum of P6,000, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason</em>, and <em>Reyes, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p>MORAN, C. <em>J</em>.:</p>
<p>I hereby certify that Mr. Justice Montemayor, who is now in Baguio, took part 
in the consideration of this case and voted to impose the penalty of 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em> against the appellant.</p></div>
