				<H3>NICOMEDES SULLER, PROTESTANT AND APPELLEE, VS. PRIMITIVO S. PEREZ, PROTESTEE AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance 
of Pangasinan, dated October 25, 1944, the dispositive part of which reads as 
follows: "En su virtud el Juzgado ordena que se ponga a disposicion del 
protestado la cantidad de mil pesos ya mencionada en pago de las costas a que 
han sido condenados el protestante y sus fiadores, y al Registrador de Titulos 
de Pangasinan a que restituya los Certificados de Titulo de las parcelas de 
terrenos constituidas en fianza hipotecaria, la cual queda por la presente 
cancelada."
<p align="justify">The case was originally elevated to the Court of Appeals which, 
in view of the fact that no evidence was introduced at the hearing in the lower 
court, and only questions of law are raised by the appellant, certified the same 
to this Court in a resolution dated October 28, 1950, which recites the facts 
necessary to the present appeal. Said facts are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In the general elections of 1937, Primitivo Perez was 
proclaimed elected Mayor of the municipality of San Manuel, Pangasinan. 
Nicomedes Suller filed a motion of protest, and after it was given due course in 
the lower court and in the Court of Appeals, the protest was finally lost in the 
Supreme Court.</p>
<p align="justify">"Upon return of the records to the court of origin, the latter, 
by order of November 27, 1941, approved the bill of costs filed by the protestee 
amounting to Pl,967. The protestant and his bonds-men asked for a 
reconsideration of that order, but by reason of the war that broke out in the 
Pacific, the motion was not heard until September 27, 1944, when the bondsmen, 
Francisco Asuncion and Bonifacio Sicam, filed a petition praying that the 
protestee or his lawyers be ordered to receive from the Clerk of Court the sum 
of P1,000 they had deposited in payment of the costs which the protestant had 
been sentenced to pay to the protestee, and to order the Register of Deeds of 
Pangasinan to deliver to the movants the Torrens Titles of their respective 
parcels of land given as mortgage security in favor of the protestant. As this 
petition was granted, protestee's counsel appealed from that order and filed the 
corresponding record on appeal on November 17, 1944, on which no action was 
taken by the court due to the uncertainties prevailing at that period on account 
of the war. </p>
<p align="justify">"After liberation, or on August 14, 1950, the matter of the 
approval of the record on appeal dated November 17, 1944, was set for hearing, 
and there being no objection raised, the same was approved by the lower court by 
order of August 30, 1950." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It may be added that the appellant had refused to accept the 
deposit of P1,000 made by the bondsmen with the clerk of the Court of First 
Instance of Pangasinan, on the ground that the lower court had no jurisdiction 
over the proceedings because the Election Law under which the lower court 
approved appellant's bill of costs in the sum of P1,967 on November 27, 1941, 
was not in force during the Japanese regime, when said deposit was made. 
Although the appellant is not pressing this obligation, in his brief, it may not 
be amiss to point out that while political laws were suspended during the 
Japanese military occupation, the order of November 27, 1941, awarding to the 
appellant costs in the amount of PI,967, merely became the source of a civil 
obligation against the appellee and his bondsmen; and the lower court obviously 
had jurisdiction to entertain the petition of the bondsmen to direct the 
appellant to accept the amount of P1,000 deposited by the bondsmen on September 
27, 1944, in satisfaction of the civil liability of said bondsmen.</p>
<p align="justify">The contention now insisted upon by the appellant is that as 
the judgment for costs was for P1,967, the amount of P1,000 deposited by the 
bondsmen was not a full payment of the obligation, with the result that the 
appellant (creditor) could not be compelled to receive such partial payment, in 
accordance with article 1169 of the old Civil Code which provides that "unless 
the contract expressly authorizes it the creditor cannot be compelled to accept 
partial performances of the undertaking of which the obligation consists." This 
contention is without merit, as it fails to take into account the fact that the 
liability of the bondsmen under their bond was limited to P1,000, the very 
amount deposited by them in court. Hence, as to the bondsmen, the amount of 
P1,000 represented the full payment of their obligation, without prejudice of 
course to the right of appellant to recover the unpaid balance from the 
appellee, the principal judgment debtor. </p>
<p align="justify">The fact that the amount deposited was in Japanese military 
notes is of no moment, since said notes were legal tender at the time. Although 
as intimated by counsel for appellant, the order of November 27, 1941, did not 
direct the appellee and his bondsmen to deposit the amount of costs within a 
certain period, it is nonetheless evident that said amount could be paid at any 
time thereafter, without waiting for the coercive process of execution which is 
resorted to only in ease the judgment debtor fails or refuses to pay. </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the appealed order is affirmed with costs against 
the appellant. So ordered. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>DISIDENTE</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>PABLO, M.:</strong></p>
<p align="justify">La obligacion de pagar la cantidad de PI,967 en concepto de 
costas quedo exigible desde el 27 de noviembre de 1941 y debia pagarse en moneda 
filipina segun los terminos precisos de la fianza; pero los fiadores consignaron 
en 27 de septiembre de 1944, P1,000 en papel moneda japonesa y no en moneda 
filipina. Por tal motivo, el protestado no estaba obligado a recibir la 
consignation, pues el articulo 1170 del Codigo Civil expresamente dispone que 
"el pago de las deudas de dinero debera hacerse en la especie pactada" y el 
articulo 1177 del mismo codigo dispone que "la consignation sera ineficaz si no 
se ajusta estrictamente a las disposiciones que regulan el pago." </p>
<p align="justify">Tengase en cuenta que, al tiempo de la consignation, no habia 
ninguna orden legal que prohibiese el uso de la moneda filipina. La proclama de 
10 de enero de 1942 del General en jefe de las fuerzas japonesas es del tenor 
siguiente: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The currencies which shall be sanctioned by the authorities of 
the Japanese Army to circulate in the Philippine Islands shall be the Paco 
Military Notes which are issued by the Imperial Japanese Government, <span style="font-style: italic;">and the 
Philippine peso currency, which is already in circulation</span>. </p>
<p align="justify">"The circulation of the Yen Paper money (paper money issued by 
the Japanese Imperial Government, Yen notes issued by the Bank of Japan, Yen 
notes issued by the Bank of Chosen, Yen notes issued by the Bank of Taiwan, and 
the military notes other than Peso Military Notes), piastre currency (notes 
issued by the Bank of Indo-China), and all other currencies of foreign countries 
shall be prohibited.</p>
<p align="justify">"However, as for the U. S. dollar currency, the circulation 
shall be approved at the rate of two pesos (P2), per one dollar ($1), for the 
time being. </p>
<p align="justify">"Not only the payer of the above-mentioned currencies, which 
are prohibited to circulate as the means of payment of all transactions, but 
also the receiver of such currencies shall be punished in accordance with the 
provisions of the martial law. </p>
<p align="justify">"As to the treatment of the possession in the market of the 
above-mentioned currencies and the U. S. dollar currency which are prohibited to 
circulate shall be regulated later on. </p>

<div style="text-align: right;">COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE FORCES."</div></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">No solamente no se prohibio la circulation legal de la moneda 
nlipina sino que se sanciono su uso. El primer parrafo de la proclama no da 
lugar a duda alguna. El protestado tenia perfectisimo derecho de obligar a los 
fiadores a que le paguen con moneda filipina legitima, o que la consignacion sea 
de la misma moneda.</p>
<p align="justify">En mi opinion, debe revocarse la orden apelada y los fiadores 
deben pagar hoy los mil pesos en moneda filipina.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Order affirmed</span>.</div>
