				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an action&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; by plaintiff&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure the dissolution of an attachment made by the provincial sheriff of Cebu, on behalf of Elena R. Causin, of property known as&nbsp; lot No.&nbsp; 15-D&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Banilad Estate,&nbsp; situated in the barrio of&nbsp; Cogon,&nbsp; City of Cebu,&nbsp; and&nbsp; covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 410.&nbsp; From&nbsp; an order denying the petition for dissolution of the attachment plaintiff appealed to&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Appeals which,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; endorsed the case to us,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reason that only&nbsp; questions&nbsp; of law are involved in the appeal.<br><br>The record discloses that on November&nbsp; 25, 1950,&nbsp; Rogaciano&nbsp; Espiritu&nbsp; sold&nbsp; the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land&nbsp; in question&nbsp; to Agustin Ramirez for P1.00,&nbsp; with the condition that the vendee assume a first mortgage executed on the property in favor of the Philippine National Bank and certain obligations of the vendor with the Firestone Tires and Rubber Company and Violeta G. de Galvez&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; "A").&nbsp; The deed of sale was&nbsp; entered&nbsp; in the&nbsp; day book&nbsp; of the register of deeds of Cebu on May 10, 1951, upon payment of an entry fee of P0.50.&nbsp; However, the sale&nbsp; was&nbsp; not transcribed at the hack of the certificate of title for the&nbsp; reason that this was&nbsp; then in the&nbsp; possession of the mortgagee,&nbsp; Philippine National Bank.<br><br>On July&nbsp; 14, 1951,&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; court of Cebu&nbsp; City entered a judgment in its civil case No. R-763, entitled Elena It, Causin&nbsp; 41s. Rogaciano R. Espiritu, for defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of P950, with interest and attorney's fees.&nbsp; Execution&nbsp; of this judgment was ordered on July 30, 1951, and levy was made upon&nbsp; the property of the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; August 4,&nbsp; 1951, the attachment was&nbsp; inscribed on Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 410 as entry&nbsp; No. 5215 V-2-D. B.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 23,1951, plaintiff herein filed a third-party claim against the attachment but as Causin filed the bond required of her by the sheriff, the latter continued the proceedings for the sale of the property on execution. So Ramirez brought&nbsp; the&nbsp; present&nbsp; action&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Cebu on September 18,&nbsp; 1951, to dissolve the attachment and enjoin the sheriff from proceeding with the sale and to recover damages.&nbsp; Meanwhile, oh September 22, 1951,&nbsp; transfer certificate&nbsp; of title&nbsp; No. 410 in the name of Rogaciano C. Espiritu was cancelled and in&nbsp; lieu thereof transfer certificate of title No.&nbsp; 1786 issued in the name of Agustin Ramirez.&nbsp; This&nbsp; new&nbsp; transfer certificate of title carries on the back the attachment&nbsp; and levy in favor of Elena R. Causin.<br><br>After the issues were joined the parties went to&nbsp; trial and&nbsp; thereafter the court rendered the decision appealed from, after reconsidering a&nbsp; previous&nbsp; order granting the prayer of the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; this appeal plaintiff-appellant's contention is that as the sale in his favor was entered in the day book of the register of deeds on May 10, 1951, previous to the annotation of the attachment&nbsp; on August 4, 1951, and inasmuch as the sale was subsequently registered and a new transfer&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; issued in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name of the vendee, the registration retro acts to the date of the&nbsp; original entry on the day book, which took place&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1951 and therefore the sale is superior to the attachment levied upon on behalf of the defendant.&nbsp; In support of this contention plaintiff-appellant cites the case of Fidelity &amp; Surety Co,&nbsp; vs. Conegero, 41 Phil. 396.&nbsp; The defendant-appellee argues&nbsp; that&nbsp; as the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of sale, Exhibit "A", was&nbsp; not registered&nbsp; until September 22, 1951, the sale&nbsp; did not&nbsp; bind nor&nbsp; convey the land to the&nbsp; purchaser until said date,&nbsp; and before the&nbsp; actual registration of the deed of sale, and when the&nbsp; registration actually&nbsp; took&nbsp; place&nbsp; the&nbsp; attachment&nbsp; had already been registered previously, on August 4, 1951.<br><br>A study of the case of Fidelity and Surety&nbsp; Company vs. Conegero,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; cited by plaintiff-appellant,&nbsp; fails&nbsp; to&nbsp; support his contention.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts of that case are different from those of the case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar because in the former the deed of sale could not be registered because the title upon which it was supposed to operate was non-existent.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that a portion of&nbsp; the decision which says:<br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; wherever registration is actually effected and new certificate&nbsp; issued,&nbsp; the registration is retroactive&nbsp; and&nbsp; takes effect by (relation as of the date when the annotation in the entry book&nbsp; was made."&nbsp; (p. 400) </blockquote>was&nbsp; a mere&nbsp; dictum.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the latter part of the decision cites&nbsp; section 50&nbsp; of Act No. 496 insofar as it provides that&nbsp; "the act of registration&nbsp; is the operative act to convey and affect the land" and further states&nbsp; that section&nbsp; 57 requires various steps in order&nbsp; that registration may be&nbsp; considered complete, namely, the presentation of the deed of sale <i>and the&nbsp; production of the grantor's duplicate certificate</i>,&nbsp; upon which,the title is founded, to the register of deeds for cancellation.<br><br>A comparative study of sections 50, 55 and 72 of the Land Registration&nbsp; Act&nbsp; will readily disclose the differences&nbsp; between the registration of voluntary instruments and those of&nbsp; attachments or other&nbsp; liens&nbsp; or&nbsp; adverse&nbsp; claims.&nbsp; With respect to the former (voluntary conveyances), section 50 expressly provides that the act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the land;&nbsp; but section 55 requires the presentation&nbsp; of the owner's duplicate certificate for the registration of any deed,&nbsp; or&nbsp; voluntary instrument, thus:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 55. No new certificate of title shall be entered,&nbsp; no memorandum shall he made upon any certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title by the register of deeds, in&nbsp; pursuance of any deed&nbsp; or other voluntary instrument, <i>unless the owner's duplicate certificate in presented for such indorsement</i>, except&nbsp; in&nbsp; cases expressly provided for in this&nbsp; Act, or upon the order of the court, for&nbsp; cause&nbsp; shown; and whenever such order is made, a memorandum thereof shall be entered upon the now certificate of title and upon&nbsp; the owner's duplicate."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Act&nbsp; No. 496.) (Italics supplied.) But with&nbsp; respect to&nbsp; involuntary&nbsp; instruments like&nbsp; attachments, executions or adverse claims, section&nbsp; 72 allows registration, even&nbsp; without&nbsp; the presentation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the duplicate certificate of title,&nbsp; thus:</blockquote><blockquote>"Sec. 72. In every case where an attachment&nbsp; or other lien or adverse claim of any description is registered, and the duplicate certificate is not presented&nbsp; at the time of registration to the register of deeds, he shall within twenty-four hours thereafter send notice by mail to the registered owner, stating that such&nbsp; paper&nbsp; has been registered, and requesting" him to send or produce the duplicate certificate in order that a memorandum&nbsp; of the&nbsp; attachment or other lien or adverse claim shall be made thereon.&nbsp; If the owner neglects or refuses to comply within a reasonable time, the register of deeds shall suggest the fact to&nbsp; the court, and the&nbsp; court, after notice, shall enter an order to the owner to produce his&nbsp; certificate at a&nbsp; time and place to be named therein,&nbsp; and may enforce the order by suitable process."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Act No. 496.)</blockquote>As above expressly indicated, an involuntary deed needs presentation only, and it is the register of deeds who completes registration by requiring the production of&nbsp; the certificate from&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner so&nbsp; that the proper attachment, execution, lien or adverse&nbsp; claim may be noted thereon.<br><br>The differences above indicated between voluntary registration and the&nbsp; registration of involuntary instruments such&nbsp; as attachments,&nbsp; executions, liens&nbsp; or adverse&nbsp; claims, has heretofore been indicated by Us in the cases of Villasor vs. Camom, et al., 89&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 404; Defensor vs.&nbsp; Brillo,&nbsp; 98 Phil., 427; 52&nbsp; Off. Gaz., (17)&nbsp; 7281;&nbsp; Barretto vs.&nbsp; Arevalo, 99 Phil., 776; 52 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., (13)&nbsp; 5818.&nbsp; In the case of Villasor vs. Camon, et al., <i>supra</i>, we pointed out the&nbsp; distinction between requirements of registration of voluntary instruments&nbsp; and&nbsp; those&nbsp; of involuntary&nbsp; instruments, thus:<br><blockquote>"The reason for&nbsp; the difference between the conditions required for the registration of a voluntary&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; of an involuntary instrument is obvious.&nbsp; The law requires the&nbsp; production of the owner's duplicate certificate by the registrant by a voluntary instrument together with&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed or instrument to be registered, because as a voluntary instrument is a willful act of&nbsp; the registered owner&nbsp; of the land to be affected by the registration,&nbsp; it is to be presumed that he is interested in registering the instrument, and&nbsp; would willingly surrender, present or produce his duplicate certificate of title to the register of deeds&nbsp; in order to accomplish such registration.&nbsp; And this is the reason why the second paragraph of Section 55 provides that<br><br>"The production&nbsp; of the&nbsp; owner's&nbsp; duplicate&nbsp; certificate whenever any voluntary instrument is&nbsp; presented for registration shall be conclusive authority from&nbsp; the registered owner to the register of deeds to enter a new certificate or to make&nbsp; a memorandum of&nbsp; registration in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; such&nbsp; instrument,'.<br><br>"But in case of involuntary instrument such as an attachment, or other lien or adverse claim of any&nbsp; description, as the&nbsp; registration thereof is contrary to the&nbsp; interests of the&nbsp; registered owner or will affect him adversely, it is but natural that&nbsp; he&nbsp; will not willingly pre- sent or produce his duplicate certificate or at least delay his&nbsp; production as&nbsp; long&nbsp; as possible.&nbsp; For that&nbsp; reason,&nbsp; the law does not require its&nbsp; presentation&nbsp; together with the involuntary instrument, as in the case of voluntary instrument, and considers the annotation of such&nbsp; instrument&nbsp; upon the entry&nbsp; book&nbsp; as&nbsp; sufficient to&nbsp; affect&nbsp; the real estate to. which it relates; but section 72 of Act No. 496&nbsp; imposes upon the&nbsp; register of deeds&nbsp; the duty, within twenty-four hours thereafter, to request&nbsp; or require the registered owner to send or&nbsp; produce his duplicate certificate&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; make thereon&nbsp; a memorandum of the attachment or other&nbsp; lien or adverse claim.&nbsp; To provide or hold that an attachment or other involuntary instrument entered in the entry book is not to be considered as duly registered unless and until the duplicate certificate is produced, would defeat the purpose of the registration&nbsp; law.<br><br>"Wherefore, the lower&nbsp; court did&nbsp; not commit any error in holding that the mere registration in the entry book of the deed of sale or assignment of all his rights and interest in&nbsp; the lot in question by the defendant Cannon&nbsp; to the appellant, without the production&nbsp; of&nbsp; the owner's duplicate&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of title and annotation of such assignment thereon and on the original, did not have the effect of a&nbsp; conveyance of Cannon's right and interest on&nbsp; said lot to the plaintiff, and&nbsp; a notice of such conveyance to all other&nbsp; persons or the defendant Lizares from&nbsp; the time of such registration."</blockquote>In the case of Defensor vs.&nbsp; Brillo, <i>supra</i>, we held:<br><blockquote>"First:&nbsp; The doctrine is well-settled that&nbsp; a levy on execution&nbsp; duly registered takes preference over a prior unregistered sale (Gomez vs. Levy Hermanos, 67 Phil. 134); and&nbsp; that even&nbsp; if the prior sale is subsequently registered, before&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; in&nbsp; execution but after the levy was&nbsp; duly made,&nbsp; the validity&nbsp; of the execution sale should be maintained,&nbsp; because it retro acts to&nbsp; the date of the levy (Vargas vs. Tansioco,&nbsp; 67 Phil.&nbsp; 308; Chin Lin &amp; Co.&nbsp; vs. Mercado, 67 Phil.&nbsp; 409; Phil.&nbsp; Executive Commission&nbsp; vs. Abadilla,&nbsp; 74&nbsp; Phil. 68); otherwise, the preference created by the levy would&nbsp; be meaningless and&nbsp; illusory (Phil. Executive Commission, vs. Abadilla, supra.)."</blockquote> And in the case of Barretto vs. Arevalo, et al., <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>,&nbsp; we held:<br><blockquote>"As to plaintiff's deed of sale, as to which registration is voluntary, not involuntary, its presentation and&nbsp; entry in&nbsp; the day book&nbsp; without surrender of the title, did not operate to convey and affect the&nbsp; land sold&nbsp; or conveyed (Villasor vs. Camon, et&nbsp; al., 89 Phil., 404).</blockquote>In&nbsp; accordance with the principles&nbsp; enunciated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the above&nbsp; cases,&nbsp; it&nbsp; seems clear that&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed of&nbsp; sale in favor of Agustin Ramirez on May 10,&nbsp; 1951 was not accompanied upon&nbsp; presentation by&nbsp; the&nbsp; duplicate certificate of title&nbsp; covering the land, the registration of the aforementioned deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale cannot be considered as having been effected on said date.&nbsp; Consequently, when&nbsp; on August 4, 1951 the attachment in favor&nbsp; of Elena R.&nbsp; Causin was presented, which was immediately transcribed on the Transfer Certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Title&nbsp; No. 410,&nbsp; said&nbsp; attachment&nbsp; was&nbsp; not affected&nbsp; by the entry of&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; as the sale was not yet registered, and&nbsp; the levy of attachment became full, complete and binding on&nbsp; all the parties&nbsp; in interest&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as on&nbsp; all third&nbsp; persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; follows also that the attachment already inscribed on August 4,&nbsp; 1951 acquired precedence over&nbsp; the right of purchaser&nbsp; Agustin Ramirez, which became effective only on September 22, 1951.<br><br>The contention of plaintiff-appellant that the registration of the deed of sale in his favor&nbsp; retro-acted from the date on&nbsp; which the&nbsp; entry&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; was made&nbsp; in the&nbsp; day&nbsp; book of the register of deeds of May 10, 1951 is clearly inconsistent with the provisions of section 55 requiring the presentation of the duplicate certificate&nbsp; in order to make a conveyance&nbsp; effective&nbsp; as&nbsp; to third&nbsp; persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we admit the contention, it would be true of the parties&nbsp; only, and the retro-action would not operate to defeat the attachment which had become full and&nbsp; complete when the actual registration of the&nbsp; deed of sale was effected.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, admitting for the sake of argument that&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed of sale&nbsp; should&nbsp; retro-act to the date&nbsp; of registration of the deed in the day book of the register of&nbsp; deeds, this should be as between&nbsp; the parties to the contract only, and&nbsp; may not prejudice&nbsp; any rights that may&nbsp; have arisen&nbsp; and&nbsp; were perfected between the&nbsp; time of the entry of&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; in the day&nbsp; book&nbsp; and that of its presentation (of the deed) and&nbsp; its&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; registration&nbsp; or transcription on the certificate of title, or the issuance of&nbsp; a&nbsp; new certificate&nbsp; of title in favor of the purchaser.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order of the court denying&nbsp; the petition for&nbsp; cancellation of the attachment was, therefore, correct.<br><br>We&nbsp; have taken&nbsp; pains&nbsp; to&nbsp; ascertain&nbsp; if&nbsp; our ruling&nbsp; as above&nbsp; set forth in any way conflicts with our&nbsp; decisions in the cases of Poteneiano, et al.&nbsp; vs. Dineros, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; L-7614, prom.&nbsp; May&nbsp; 31, 1955&nbsp; and&nbsp; Levin&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Bass, etc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> G. R.&nbsp; Nos. L-4340-46, prom. May&nbsp; 28, 1952.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of&nbsp; Poteneiano, et&nbsp; al. vs.&nbsp; Dineros,&nbsp; Potenciano&nbsp; presented for registration a deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale in his favor <i>accompanied with the owner's duplicate certificate of title</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The entry was made in the&nbsp; day book.&nbsp; It so happened,&nbsp; however, that the documents presented were lost or destroyed in&nbsp; the course of the confusion caused&nbsp; by the war.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale and the attempted registration took place in November, 1944, and in April, 1946, the land already sold to Potenciano was attached.&nbsp;&nbsp; Potenciano filed&nbsp; a third party claim. We held that the entry of&nbsp; the deed of&nbsp; sale in&nbsp; registry affected&nbsp; the&nbsp; land, and we rejected the attaching creditor's contention that the entry in&nbsp; the day book is not sufficient registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; why the sale was considered effective as against a subsequent attaching creditor was because the deed of sale when presented for registration was accompanied with the&nbsp; owner's duplicate certificate of&nbsp; title&nbsp; to the property.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the&nbsp; confusion&nbsp; that existed in the City of Manila at the time of the registration, no&nbsp; new transfer certificate of title was issued,&nbsp; and it was not the fault of the purchaser who registered the deed, as he&nbsp; had complied&nbsp; with all the&nbsp; acts necessary to effect the registration of the deed of sale, namely the registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deed of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; and the&nbsp; submission therewith of&nbsp; the&nbsp; certificate of title to the property, which presentation is considered as the authority for the Register of&nbsp; deeds&nbsp; to&nbsp; register the deed&nbsp; of sale in question.&nbsp; This case, therefore, is distinguished from the case at bar, in that in the latter <i>there was no presentation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; duplicate certificate of title</i> at the time&nbsp; of the presentation of the deed of sale which was entered in the registry,&nbsp; such presentation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; duplicate&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title&nbsp; having been made only after the opposing party had&nbsp; levied upon the property&nbsp; and registered&nbsp; the attachment thereon.<br><br>The case of Levin vs. Bass, on the other hand, supports our ruling in the&nbsp; case at bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; that case,&nbsp; we held:<br><blockquote>"* * * ,&nbsp; Do the entry in the day book&nbsp; of a deed of sale which was presented&nbsp; and&nbsp; filed together with the owner's duplicate certificate of title with the office&nbsp; of the Register&nbsp; of Deeds and full payment of registration fees constitute a complete act of registration which operates to convey and affect the land?&nbsp; In voluntary registration, such a&nbsp; sale, mortgage, lease and the like, if the owner's&nbsp; duplicate certificate be not surrendered and presented or if no payment of registration fees be made within 16 days, entry in the day book of the&nbsp; deed of sale does&nbsp; not&nbsp; operate&nbsp; to&nbsp; convey and&nbsp; affect&nbsp; the&nbsp; land sold. * * *."</blockquote>As&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case at&nbsp; bar&nbsp; the duplicate&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title was not surrendered at the time of the presentation of the deed of&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as having been made and the registration of the deed of sale did&nbsp; not affect&nbsp; and&nbsp; convey the&nbsp; land sold.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the subsequent <i>attachment</i>, which "was accompanied&nbsp; by the&nbsp; duplicate&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title,&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; preference&nbsp; over&nbsp; the deed of sale, because the latter was not validly registered until after the attachment&nbsp; had already been lawfully and validly entered and registered.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with costs against the plaintiff-appellant. <br><br><i>Paras, C.
