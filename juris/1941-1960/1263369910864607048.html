				<H3>COMPAÑIA MARITIMA,  PETITIONER,  VS.  UNITED  SEAMEN'S UNION OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review of the order of the Court of Industrial Relations requiring  Compania Maritima  to reinstate 22 members of the  complement  of  its  M/V  Cebu,  and to give them back-pay from February 12, 1954.<br><br>In  July 1953, says the  order, "they were serving in the Steward  Department on board the M/V Cebu, on  a round trip from Manila to  Jedda Mecca and vice versa. The  voyage started  on  July 7,  and  the vessel returned on October 16, 1953; but  instead  of touching the  port of origin, Manila, it proceeded to San Fernando, La Union, Where the respondent  company  (Compañia  Maritima) disembarked and  dismissed the aforesaid workers.   When they reached Manila by land transportation and reported to the respondent's  (Maritima's) Manila Office,  they were given their pay.  After the M/V Cebu arrived in Manila, it was sent to Japan for drydocking.  In February  of 1954, when the M/V Cebu returned to Manila from Japan they  (the personnel of said vessel  who were  dismissed at San Fernando),  petitioned the  General  Manager, Don Jose Fernandez to be allowed to return to their former positions on  the  M/V Cebu.  * * *."  They were  given to understand  that  they  would  be  reemployed  if  they joined the  General Maritime Stevedores Union— which apparently enjoyed the goodwill of  the company.  However, they refused to join such  Union, and consequently were not taken back.  Instead, 20  new men recommended by such Union were employed to take their places. <br><br>The discharged personnel  happened  to  belong  to  the United Seamen's Union of the  Philippines, which  took their case to the Court of Industrial Relations, asserting unfair labor practice on the part of  Compañia  Maritima. <br><br>After  hearing  the  parties, said Court  found the discharge and non-employment  to have been  caused by the men's refusal to desert the United Seamen's  Union and to join the General Maritime Stevedores Union; that the company was thereby guilty of discrimination  in  regard to hire or tenure of employees—contrary to the provisions of Republic Act 875 sec. 4 (a) number 4.   Consequently, it issued the order which  is now  the subject  of this review. <br><br>Before the  Industrial Court these defenses  were presented by the company:  (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)  the 22 men had been engaged for <span style="font-style: italic;">only  one trip</span>, viz,  Manila to  Jedda and vice versa; and  (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)  they were called for re-employment  when  the boat returned from Japan, but they  were out of Manila. <br><br>Said Court, however,  found that all  (the 22  men) had been  working with the company  for  many years; that although they had  signed shipping articles for a  given voyage—expiring at the termination thereof—the practice had  been  to continue the  employment until  they were discharged  (legally)  or left  the ship voluntarily.  The second defense was  discredited: the circumstances showed, and the Court of Industrial Relations  declared, that they were not  re-taken  aboard,  because they  had  refused  to join the General  Maritime Stevedores Union, which was the rival labor union of the  United  Seamen's, which  in turn had a pending controversy with the  Compañia  Maritima regarding increase of wages. <br><br>At this juncture, it  should be  stated, there was no unanimity in giving due course to this petition for review. The  majority  was  impressed by the  allegations in the petition  that these seamen  were  <span style="font-style: italic;">additional extra personnel,  specially  engaged</span> for the Manila-Mecca voyage, who were  discharge at the end of their written contract of  employment, because their services as <span style="font-style: italic;">extra messmen</span> were no longer needed.   Aware of the  Industrial  Court's finding that they had been working with the company for <span style="font-style: italic;">many years</span>—not  specially engaged  for the  trip—the majority still wanted  to give petitioner a chance to demonstrate that no substantial evidence of record supported such findings.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>  Nevertheless, the arguments  and record before us fail to overthrow the court's factual conclusion. Indeed,  the employment  of other men  to substitute the discharged personnel, when there was  no special trip contemplated,  seems  conclusively to show  the positions belonged to the normal payroll of the vessel—not emergency or extra positions, as petitioner represented. <br><br>As such  old  hands, these 22 men  may not, by the mere pretext of temporarily reducing  the personnel  on account of drydocking, be  permanently ousted when the vessel returned to resume its ordinary activities.  In fact, the  company's practice  has been to  re-take  its laid-off personnel upon return  of  the  vessel  from  drydocking.  <br><br>What  is worse in this  case, it refused to  follow that practice because the  22 men declined to follow  its indication to join the  General  Maritime Services Union and quit the United Seamen's Union. <br><br>The terms  of the Industrial  Peace  Act are  clear:  it is unfair labor  practice for an employer "to discriminate in regard to hire or tenure of employment  *  * * to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization"  (Section  4 [a]  Republic  Act  875)—except when there  is a closed-shop arrangement, which  in this case has not been proven to exist. <br><br>For such unfair  practice, the company may be required to reinstate the 22 workers with backpay.  (Section 5 [c] Republic Act 875.) The order is affirmed, with costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Montemayor, Reyes, A.,  Bautista  Angelo Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
