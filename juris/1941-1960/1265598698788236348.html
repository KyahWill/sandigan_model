				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Andres R. Camasura, was arrested in the City of Davao on June 17, 
1946.
<p>On June 28, 1946, he filed with the lower court a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus which in an order dated June 29, was registered free from court 
fees, granting petitioner's prayer that he be allowed to institute the case as a 
pauper.</p>
<p>This case happens not to be an ordinary one. On July 1, the corresponding 
writ of habeas corpus was issued, and on July 2, the respondent filed his 
return. After trial, the lower court denied on July 20, 1946, the petition for 
release of petitioner. The order of denial was promulgated only on July 29. On 
the same day petitioner appealed to this court.</p>
<p>For purposes of said appeal, the stenographic notes taken at the trial, 
consisting of eighteen pages, were delivered on August 12 to court stenographer 
Antonio Baz, for him to transcribe, with instructions to forward the transcript 
to this court. Said Stenographer's delays in complying with the instructions 
resulted in disagreeable consequences to petitioner.</p>
<p>The clerk of the lower court notified the parties that the records on appeal 
were to be forwarded to the Supreme Court on August 12, 1946. The record is 
silent as to why, notwithstanding the fact that the notice of appeal was 
received by the lower court at 11.30 a. m. on July 31, 1946, no steps were taken 
to give due course to the appeal until after twelve days.</p>
<p>On August 29, 1946, stenographer Baz was required by our clerk to forward to 
this court, within ten days from notice, the transcript of the stenographic 
notes taken in the case, with the warning that his failure will be reported to 
the court for appropriate action.</p>
<p>The stenographer failed to comply with the requirement, and on October 21, 
1946, we resolved to warn said stenographer that disciplinary action will be 
taken against him unless he submit said transcript within ten days from 
notice.</p>
<p>On December 2, 1946, the stenographer sent a letter to our clerk, informing 
that the transcript that he had intended to forward to this court on the morning 
of said day, was burned the previous night in the fire that destroyed the 
building occupied by the Court of First Instance of Davao. He keeps silent as to 
the stenographic notes themselves and as to whether he can transcribe them 
again.</p>
<p>On December 9, 1946, we adopted a resolution requiring the parties to move in 
the premises within five days from notice. Petitioner, after doubting the 
veracity of the alleged destruction, suspecting it as another move of his 
adversaries to keep him longer in confinement, ended with a general petition for 
justice. Considering that the questions involved are generally, if not entirely, 
of law and that the controversial points of facts can be proved and supported by 
original or authentic copies of documentary evidence, in justice to the 
petitioner, the Solicitor General moved that the appeal be given due course, 
provided petitioner can prepare and present his brief without availing himself 
of the transcript. Accordingly, the parties filed their briefs.</p>
<p>It may not be amiss that, impatient as to the outcome of his appeal, 
petitioner filed with this court on November 11, 1946, a new petition for a writ 
of habeas corpus sworn on the seventh of said month, and the case has been 
pending for our decision since November 27, 1946, the date of the filing of the 
Solicitor General's memorandum.</p>
<p>From the evidence in the record it appears that respondent's authority to 
arrest petitioner and keep him in confinement is based on the following 
communication of the Director of Prisons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"<i>June 14, 1946</i></p>
<p>"Sir:</p>
<p>"Confidential report has been received by this office to the effect that 
Andres Camasura y Relacion, <i>alias</i> Benjamin Gelbolingo who is one of the 
'missing' prisoners, is now residing in the City of Davao.</p>
<p>"This prisoner has yet a long prison term to serve. Your cooperation in 
having him captured and re-committed to the new Bilibid Prison in Muntinglupa, 
Rizal, is requested. A copy of his picture and descriptive record are 
enclosed.</p>

<p>No commitment and no judicial decision or order was produced to justify 
petitioner's imprisonment. In view of respondent's failure to present evidence 
showing that petitioner is in custody under a warrant of commitment in pursuance 
of law, as mentioned in sections 13 and 14 of Rule 102, it is evident that 
petitioner would be entitled to be forthwith discharged from confinement in 
accordance with section 15 of the same rule.</p>
<p>But we are not to issue such an order without first passing upon petitioner's 
own allegations, wherein it appears that he has been convicted in three cases by 
Commonwealth courts before the war, and in eight other cases in 1942 and 1943, 
by courts under the Japanese regime, and that on September 4, 1944, he was 
released by virtue of a pardon granted to him "by the Japanese Imperial 
Government" and by the consequent order "by the Vice-Admiral, Japanese Imperial 
Navy, Davao Base," and upon the legal questions arising therein.</p>
<p>What evidence respondent failed to produce as to judicial orders for 
commitment of petitioner has been made up by the numerous documentary evidence 
submitted by petitioner in the lower court and in this court at the hearing that 
took place on February 6, 1947. Among the documents presented by petitioner 
there appears a list prepared by the Bureau of Prisons of all criminal cases by 
virtue of which petitioner has been committed for confinement either as a 
detainee or as a prisoner to serve final and executory sentence. Said list is 
attached hereto as Appendix A.</p>
<p>Therein appears that on August 23, 1941, he fully served his sentences in 
three cases, Nos. 56710, 55369, and 55579, and on August 24, 1941, commenced to 
run the sentences in the first three cases of the last group of eleven appearing 
in the appendix, <i>i. e.</i>, Nos. 58719, 60060, 60061. The three cases were 
decided in 1941 before the Japanese invasion. There can be no question that the 
sentences in said three cases, where petitioner was sentenced to one year 
imprisonment in only one of them, have been fully served.</p>
<p>The remaining eight cases were all decided by courts under the Japanese 
regime, the first one on March 13, 1942, and the last one on September 23, 
1943.</p>
<p>Petitioner impugns the validity of the sentences rendered against him in said 
eight cases upon two main grounds:</p>
<ol><li>That the courts which rendered the judgments were not constituted under the 
laws and authority of the Commonwealth and the judges presiding therein were not 
appointed according to the laws and Constitution of the Philippines; 

<p></p></li><li>That the procedures which petitioner was made to undergo in said cases were 
unconstitutional and illegal, he having been compelled to plead guilty by means 
of intimidation and by brutal tortures, including water cure, whipping and 
hanging by police officer Charles Strebel and other Japanese stooges, with the 
cooperation of the Nippon <i>kempei</i>.</li></ol><p></p> The first ground finds no 
support in the majority of this court. The legal question as to the validity of 
judicial processes during and under the Japanese regime has been squarely 
decided in the leading case of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon 
(75 Phil., 113), wherein the majority opinion and the dissenting opinions of Mr. 
Justice Hilado and the writer of this decision fully expound the relative legal 
positions of the members of this court. 
<p>The record offers ample basis in support of petitioner's contention as to the 
intimidation and tortures which compelled him to plead guilty in the eight 
occupation cases, after he had previously been acquitted in several previous 
other cases in which Judges Gervasio Diaz and Arsenio Locsin pronounced that the 
several confessions upon which the prosecution has relied have been extracted 
"through duress, intimidation and force" and that petitioner had to sign them to 
avoid further maltreatments, although he knew that the facts which he was 
pressed to admit were untrue, Judge Diaz concluding that "it would be shocking 
to human conscience to inflict serious punishment upon a person, based on his 
mere confession of doubtful reliability", while Judge Locsin said that 
"Camasura's confessions were successfully repudiated by him because they were 
extracted from him thrqugh torture, violence and intimidation." It appears that 
Camasura even had to plead guilty in cases which were burned and not 
reconstituted and in several others he had to withdraw his appeals to avoid 
further harm and torture from Strebel, one of the tools employed by the Japanese 
<i>kempei</i> to make more effective their inhumane and terroristic 
practices.</p>
<p>The facts proved by petitioner convince us that the sentences rendered in the 
eight cases in question are null and void and should not be given any 
effect.</p>
<p>Upon this conclusion, it seems unnecessary to introduce a discussion as to 
the validity and beneficial effects to petitioner of the pardon granted to him 
on September 4, 1944, by the Japanese Imperial Government through the 
Vice-Admiral, the Commander in Chief of the naval base of Davao, although, upon 
the authority of the pronouncements made in Sameth <i>vs</i>. Director of 
Prisons (76 Phil., 613), and Caraos <i>vs</i>. Daza (76 Phil., 681), 
petitioner's contention may easily find support in view of the fact that at the 
time the pardon in question was granted, the Japanese were still in full control 
of the Davao area.</p>
<p>Petitioner has also contended that his arrest was partly motivated by 
political reasons, and has endeavored to show that, due to his oratorical 
ability, he became very popular and contributed "to the bad licking" of 
political opponents in Davao. Petitioner also called our attention to the fact 
that of the thousands of other prisoners who were released by the Japanese by 
pardon or otherwise, no one except him has been re-arrested.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, with the reversal of the lower court's action, it is 
ordered that petitioner Andres R. Camasura be immediately released from 
confinement, this order being addressed to any officer who has the actual 
custody of the person of petitioner.</p><i>Pablo, Hilado,</i> and <i>Briones, 
JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Moran, C.J., Paras,</i> and <i>Bengzon, JJ.,</i> concur 
in the result.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>TUASON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the result of the decision of this court on the authority of 
Sameth <i>vs</i>. Director of Prisons (76 Phil., 613), and Caraos <i>vs</i>. 
Daza (76 Phil., 681). I disagree in so far as the decision impliedly if not 
expressly repudiates the sufficiency of the Director of Prisons' letter to the 
Provost Marshal of the Philippine Army in Davao City as authority for the arrest 
of the petitioner. The Director of Prisons, personally or through his 
subordinates or agents, is not only authorized but is duty bound to arrest 
without arrest warrant a prisoner who, before the completion of his sentence, 
evades it, or is found at large without lawful permission or authority.</p>
<p>I also dissent from that part of the decision which expressly or impliedly 
holds that the petitioner is entitled to discharge on the ground that "sentences 
rendered in the eight cases in questions are null and void and should not be 
given any effect", for the reason, according to the decision, that he had to 
plead guilty in some of these cases and had to withdraw his appeals in others 
because of maltreatment and fear of full her harm and torture. These premises, 
granting their truth for the sake of argument, do not constitute legal basis for 
habeas corpus. The legality and fairness of the trials is not challenged. Remedy 
lies in a different direction in such case.</p>The court has gone out of its way 
when it makes, apparently as one of the grounds of discharge, the findings that 
petitioner's "arrest was partly motivated by political reasons, and there is 
evidence in record that, due to his oratorical ability, he became very popular 
and contributed to the bad licking of political opponents in Davao" and "that of 
the thousands of other prisoners who were released by the Japanese by pardon or 
otherwise, no one except him (petitioner) has been re-arrested." These facts are 
not alleged in the pleadings and should be ignored.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>PADILLA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I cannot agree with the majority "that the sentences rendered in the eight 
cases in question are null and void and should not be given any effect." This 
conclusion is based on the claim that "confessions upon which the prosecution 
has relied have been extracted 'through duress, intimidation and force' and that 
petitioner had to sign them to avoid further maltreatments, * * *."</p>
<p>In the first place the validity of a sentence imposed by a competent court 
cannot be attacked collaterally; in the second place confessions wrung from the 
petitioner "of doubtful reliability," in the words of Judge Diaz, or "through 
torture, violence and intimidation," in the language of Judge Locsin, were 
precisely the reason for petitioner's acquittal in said cases. Besides, this 
court cannot and should not rely on excerpts from decisions, which are not duly 
certified to by the legal keeper of the original thereof, to draw the inference 
that the proceedings in other cases in which the petitioner entered a plea of 
guilty or was found guilty were tainted with illegality.</p>
<p>The crimes for which sentences were imposed upon the petitioner in the last 
eight cases by the courts during the enemy occupation, had been committed by the 
petitioner before the outbreak of the war, with the exception of the last. They 
were crimes punished by the Revised Penal Code, and under the Commonwealth the 
petitioner would have been punished just the same. I see no valid and legal 
reason for invalidating the sentences imposed upon the petitioner in those cases 
simply because they were imposed by the courts during the enemy occupation.</p>
<p>The pardon allegedly granted him by the Japanese Imperial Government on 
September 4, 1944, is invalid, because only the President of the Republic could 
have granted it for crimes committed against the laws of the Republic.</p>
<p>There is no evidence to substantiate the claim that he was pardoned by the 
PCAU. Contrary to such claim, it appears that on August 22, 1945, the Acting 
Governor of Davao, upon instruction of Major J. J. Mason, Civil Affairs Officer 
of Davao City, requested the chief of police to apprehend the petitioner and 
deliver his person to the governor's office (Exhibit E).</p>
<p>If article 70 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 
217, is to be applied, petitioner has to undergo a long stretch of confinement 
which does not warrant the granting of the writ prayed for.</p>
<p>Other reasons advanced by petitioner should be addressed to the proper 
department of the Government, for they have no room in this proceeding.</p>For 
the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the judgment of the lower court 
should be affirmed.</div>
