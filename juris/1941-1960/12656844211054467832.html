				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the evening of February 6, 1946, four men armed with rifles entered the 
house of Alejandro Flores in Barrio Mabacan, Calauan, Laguna. Posing as officers 
of the law, they required Flores to surrender "his revolver. He replied he had 
none. Then they asked him about the money he had obtained through the sale of 
his carabao. He answered he had already used it. Thereupon the intruders — 
sufficiently identified as the herein accused Norberto Silerio, Floro Lapiz and 
Cornelio Atienza, and the fugitive from Justice Loreto Maghirang — ransacked the 
house and took therefrom money, clothes and jewels amounting t P788. But that 
was not all: after bringing Alejandro Flores outside of the house to be guarded 
by Floro Lapiz, the bandits dragged Felicidad downstairs only to be abused at 
the point of a gun first by Norberto Silerio and later by Cornelio Atienza. 
Another woman in the house, Pilar Porciuncula escaped the men's bestiality by 
pleading her physical condition — her menstruation period.
<p>The next morning the outrage was reported to the authorities; and the three 
accused were arrested on February 8, 1946. After a short investigation by 
Corporal Oculto of the military police they all admitted having taken part in 
the robbery. Silerio furthermore admitted that he and Maghirang had raped the 
woman. On the other hand Atienza and Lapiz pointed to Maghirang as the sex 
offender. The three detainees signed — or thumbmarked — and swore their 
statements before Pastor Timog, justice of the peace of Calauan, Laguna, on 
February 10, 1946. During the investigation Norberto Silerio indicated the place 
where a portion of the loot was kept. It was immediately retrieved, its items 
being listed in Exhibit D, valued at P80.</p>
<p>There is no question as to the happenings in Mabacan that night of February 
6. The identity of the robbers is sworn to by the occupants of the house and by 
the ravished woman. These have no reason falsely to impute to herein prisoners 
the commission of so grave a wrong. The immediate apprehension of the 
malefactors, the prompt start of proceedings against them, the discovery in 
their possession of part of the looted articles, plus the confessions they have 
subscribed, all make out the case for the prosecution.</p>
<p>In a way that case is strengthened by the poor alibi they tried to set up. 
They attempted to prove that during the whole month of February they were in the 
neighboring town of Pila engaged in the harvest of palay. However, they 
presented no one to corroborate their story. And Mabacan being a barrio between 
Calauan and the neighboring town of Pila, it is not impossible that in the 
evening of February 6 — when harvesting was not done — they went to Calauan to 
perform what they actually performed.</p>
<p>To be sure there are deficiencies in the declarations of the eyewitnesses and 
offended parties. The attorney for the defendants has diligently specified them. 
Yet they are obviously owing to the manner in which questions were asked, and 
the inexperience of the witnesses, what with the impressive solemnity of court 
proceedings. And considering that such oral testimony is not the only evidence 
against appellants — note the confessions and other circumstances hereinbefore 
related — we are not inclined to ascribe such deficiencies to simple perjury or 
harmful insincerity. It must be observed specially that one of the accused, 
Cornelio Atienza, testifying in court, admitted that he and his co-accused had 
raided Flores' house on the eventful night — although he exculpated himself by 
alleging that he had accompanied the others through fear and intimidation.</p>
<p>A procedural incident is the subject of the principal assignment of error: 
when the case was called for hearing in the court of first instance on October 
23, 1946, the accused appeared without counsel. The judge appointed Attorney. De 
Leon as counsel <em>de oficio</em>. After a conference with his charges said 
attorney made the following remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have talked to the accused * * * and told them to get their attorney 
because I am always busy. That is why I am not prepared for the 
trial".</p></blockquote>
<p>The judge, however, ruled that the trial could proceed. Witnesses were 
presented for the people. Counsel <em>de oficio</em> cross-examined them. A 
two-hour recess was had. Then the three accused testified upon his direct 
examination. They were in turn cross-examined by the fiscal.</p>
<p>As everything appears to have been normally conducted, we can not say that 
under the circumstances there was prejudicial error. It must be remembered in 
this connection that the first complaint was filed against these accused on 
February 10, 1946, before the justice of the peace of Calauan. The preliminary 
investigation was held there, and these defendants were represented by Atty. 
Damaso Tengco. The fiscal filed his information in the Court of First Instance 
on August 31, 1946. They were arraigned on October 9, 1946. Trial was set for 
October 23, 1946, the court advising the parties of its desire to proceed with 
the case without fail on that day. Then when the case was called on October 23 
these accused appeared without counsel. It was therefore no abuse of discretion 
for his Honor to insist on holding the trial, the accused having had enough time 
to prepare for it, had the benefit of counsel's assistance and apparently were 
bent on delaying the termination of the proceedings, they having on a previous 
occasion failed to show up and were consequently arrested by the court's order. 
Anyway, it is not shown in what manner their representation by counsel <em>de 
oficio</em> had substantially impaired their defense.</p>
<p>The offense was robbery with rape (article 294, paragraph 2, Revised Penal 
Code) aggravated by the circumstances of night time and band. Wherefore, 
inasmuch as the appealed judgment imposing on them the penalty of life 
imprisonment and requiring indemnity to the offended parties is in accordance 
with law (U.S. <em>vs.</em> Tiongco, 37 Phil., 951; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Bretana, 
49 Phil., 444) it is hereby affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Parás, Feria, Perfecto, </em>and <em>Tuason, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
