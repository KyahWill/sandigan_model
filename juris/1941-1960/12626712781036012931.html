				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff brought this action before the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur against Rufino Adan, Celedonio Ribares, Elena Vda. de Clave and Fabian Samson to recover the ownership and possession of a parcel of land.&nbsp; Defendants, in their answer, alleged that the land in question does not belong to plaintiff but&nbsp; portions thereof belong respectively to them&nbsp; although their areas have&nbsp; not been determined.<br><br>After&nbsp; several postponements, the court set the case for hearing&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp; Notice&nbsp; of hearing&nbsp; was received&nbsp; by&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for defendants on February 17, 1955. When the&nbsp; case was called for trial on the date first mentioned, counsel for both plaintiff&nbsp; and defendants informed the court that they were ready to go to trial and, accordingly, plaintiff presented her evidence consisting&nbsp; of&nbsp; her testimony and some documentary&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; After plaintiff had rested her case, defendants'&nbsp; counsel moved for continuance&nbsp; alleging that his clients&nbsp; have not come to court although he&nbsp; had notified them in writing that&nbsp; the trial was set for&nbsp; March 11, 1955. Plaintiff&nbsp; objected to&nbsp; this motion&nbsp; contending that defendants'&nbsp; counsel had informed the court that he was ready to enter trial aside from the fact that he was notified&nbsp; thereof more than 20&nbsp; days in advance and&nbsp; had&nbsp; given a&nbsp; written&nbsp; notice thereof to his clients as he&nbsp; claimed, and considering&nbsp; the opposition to be well-taken, the court denied the&nbsp; motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon, the court rendered judgment declaring plaintiff&nbsp; owner of the land in question and ordering defendants to pay her the sum of&nbsp; P7,000.00,&nbsp; to&nbsp; restore its possession&nbsp; to&nbsp; her,&nbsp; and deliver&nbsp; 100 cavans of palay each year until the land is fully restored.<br><br>On April 14, 1955,&nbsp; defendants filed a motion for new trial alleging as reasons therefor that "A week&nbsp; later defendants Rufino Adan and Elena Vda.&nbsp; de Clave&nbsp; came. Rufino&nbsp; Adan said&nbsp; that he just&nbsp; received the letter&nbsp; and Elena&nbsp; Vda.&nbsp; de Clave had just&nbsp; arrived from Olongapo. Fabian Samson could&nbsp; not come because he was too old and sickly.&nbsp; Celedonio Ribares was then&nbsp; in&nbsp; Camarines Norte."&nbsp; This&nbsp; motion&nbsp; was not verified&nbsp; nor accompanied by&nbsp; the requisite&nbsp; affidavits&nbsp; of&nbsp; merits, for&nbsp; which&nbsp; reason counsel for plaintiff registered his opposition thereto.&nbsp; But pending&nbsp; ruling on said motion, defendants' counsel filed a supplementary memorandum&nbsp; to&nbsp; which he attached the affidavits of merits.&nbsp; The court, however, found the same not well-founded&nbsp; and denied it.&nbsp; Whereupon,&nbsp; defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals which in due time rendered a confirmatory decision.&nbsp; Hence the present petition for review.<br><br>The only issue&nbsp; raised by&nbsp; appellants is that&nbsp; respondent court erred in denying their motions&nbsp; for&nbsp; postponement and for new trial&nbsp; based upon mistake and excusable negligence and&nbsp; in awarding to plaintiff&nbsp; excessive damages.<br><br>In their affidavits&nbsp; of merits,&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; stated that it was agreed between&nbsp; their counsel and&nbsp; Rufino Adan that the former would send the notice&nbsp; of hearing to Adan at Managle, Sipocot, Camarines&nbsp; Sur,&nbsp; who would in&nbsp; turn notify his&nbsp; co-defendants of&nbsp; the date of trial; that their counsel had actually&nbsp; sent a letter to Rufino Adan at said place but&nbsp; because the latter went to Larap,&nbsp; Camarines Norte&nbsp; to work in the&nbsp; mines, he received the&nbsp; letter only on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; or two days after trial,&nbsp; for which reason defendants were not able to attend the trial.&nbsp; Under these facts, appellants contend that their failure to appear was due to mistake or excusable&nbsp; negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial court however did not consider this conduct&nbsp; justifiable, more so&nbsp; when&nbsp; their counsel was given more than 20 days notice in advance&nbsp; to prepare for trial.&nbsp; Neither the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals considered the&nbsp; reasons given&nbsp; justifiable&nbsp; as may be&nbsp; seen from the following comment:<br><blockquote>"But, resolving the issue on the merits, we find that upon the facts relied upon by appellants in their motion for new trial, they were not entitled&nbsp; to it and; consequently,&nbsp; the lower court committed no abuse of discretion in issuing&nbsp; the order of denial.<br><br>"The record discloses that the corresponding notice of trial was served on&nbsp; appellants' counsel since&nbsp; February&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is, more&nbsp; than&nbsp; three weeks before the date set for&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial.&nbsp; He had more&nbsp; than sufficient time to&nbsp; notify&nbsp; his&nbsp; clients.&nbsp; That&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter did not receive the notice sent by him in&nbsp; due time must be deemed' due to their&nbsp; negligence, because a party to an action&nbsp; in&nbsp; court is under obligation&nbsp; to notify&nbsp; his&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; of his&nbsp; whereabouts,&nbsp; so that the latter may be in position to contact him readily whenever his presence&nbsp; in court is&nbsp; required.<br></blockquote>Considering the&nbsp; circumstances of this&nbsp; case, we&nbsp; find&nbsp; no plausible&nbsp; reason&nbsp; for disturbing&nbsp; the findings made&nbsp; by the trial court&nbsp; and by the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Motions for continuance are addressed at the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp; The exercise of such discretion is&nbsp; generally upheld unless&nbsp; good reasons&nbsp; are&nbsp; shown to the&nbsp; contrary.&nbsp; Here the reasons given are not satisfactory.<br><blockquote>"It is urged, in the first place, that the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; abused&nbsp; its discretion&nbsp; in&nbsp; denying&nbsp; defendants' motion for continuance.&nbsp; But it appears that there had already been two prior postponements granted both at defendants' own instance and that the last motion&nbsp; for that purpose, though sent&nbsp; five days before the date set for trial, did not conform to the Rules and gave no notice to the adverse party or counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the only&nbsp; ground&nbsp; therein&nbsp; stated was that the parties were&nbsp; on their way to an amicable&nbsp; settlement.&nbsp; But it would appear that opposing counsel informed the court&nbsp; that there was&nbsp; no&nbsp; truth about that statement as no proposal&nbsp; for settlement had&nbsp; ever&nbsp; been made.&nbsp; In the circumstances we do&nbsp; not think the lower court abused its discretion in denying a continuance.<br><br>"Defendants cannot&nbsp; now be&nbsp; heard&nbsp; to say that because trial was not postponed they were deprived of their day in court.&nbsp; No one deprived them of their day in court. Of their own volition they preferred&nbsp; not to come to the&nbsp; hearing on&nbsp; the day set,&nbsp; presumably assuming that their motion for continuance would be granted.&nbsp; Defendants had&nbsp; no right to make&nbsp; such&nbsp; assumption, for continuances are granted for good&nbsp; cause&nbsp; alleged and proved and not merely at the will of either or both of the parties&nbsp; to the case."&nbsp; (Gayon&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Ubaldo, G. R. No. L-7650, Dec.&nbsp; 28, 1955; See also Cruz <i>vs.</i> Malabayasbas,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al., <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, p. 708).<br></blockquote>With regard to the amount of damages awarded to plaintiff&nbsp; by&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court and affirmed by the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals, which&nbsp; appellants find excessive,&nbsp; the same cannot now&nbsp; be&nbsp; looked into.&nbsp; This&nbsp; involves&nbsp; a&nbsp; question&nbsp; of fact which&nbsp; is not&nbsp; within&nbsp; our&nbsp; province&nbsp; to&nbsp; consider&nbsp; at this instance.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ., </span>concur.</div>
