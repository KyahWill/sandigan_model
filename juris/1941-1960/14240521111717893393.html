motion to reconsider said decision, filed by the Central Bank&nbsp; of the Philippines,&nbsp; having been&nbsp; denied, said plaintiff brought the matter to this Court on appeal.&nbsp; The interrelated issues raised by&nbsp; appellant can be boiled down to the following: Was there&nbsp; any sale of foreign exchange in the case at bar and,&nbsp; if so, could the 17% special excise tax be' imposed upon drafts like Exhibits D and H executed and accepted before&nbsp; the effectivity of Republic Act No. 601?<br><br>The stipulation&nbsp; of&nbsp; facts shows that&nbsp; Union Books, Inc., was able to&nbsp; secure two letters&nbsp; of credit,&nbsp; Nos. 40926 for $15,000.00 on April 15, 1950, and No. 41740 for $2,650.00 on June 14,1950.&nbsp; It also appears on record that defendant appellee on several occasions made partial payments on the first draft&nbsp; amounting to P10,855.01 and the total&nbsp; sum of P2,691.67 on the second draft (Exhs. D and H), and it is not denied that at the time Republic Act No. 601 imposing the 17% excise tax on&nbsp; foreign exchange was approved on March 28, 1951, the Philippine National Bank had&nbsp; already paid Prank C. Rachal,&nbsp; Jr., of Chicago, Illinois, U. S.&nbsp; A., through the South Shore&nbsp; National Bank&nbsp; of Chicago the import of said drafts, (Exhs. B and E), chargeable&nbsp; against the letters&nbsp; of credit&nbsp; (Exhs.&nbsp; A and E) and, consequently, does not have to pay them again to the beneficiary of said drafts, although defendant-appellee still have pending obligations with the Philippine&nbsp; National Bank in connection "with said transactions. &nbsp;<br><br>The controversy, however, arose when the Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, in answer to a letter of the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, opined that "sales of exchange takes place neither on&nbsp; the establishment of the letters of credit, nor on the negotiations by the correspondent banks of drafts drawn against such letters of credit,&nbsp; but&nbsp; upon payment by the importer of said drafts", and that "until such payment is effected no sale of foreign exchange takes place"&nbsp; (Exh. B—Central Bank).&nbsp; This view obtained the full support of the Monetary Board when in its meeting of May 3,&nbsp; 1953, it unanimously adopted the policy&nbsp; that the&nbsp; 17% special excise tax on sales&nbsp; of foreign exchange should be&nbsp; collected on&nbsp; the day the bill or&nbsp; statement is paid by the importer (Exh. E—Central Bank).&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; a consequence thereof, the statements&nbsp; of&nbsp; accounts sent to&nbsp; defendant included the amounts of P3,080.90 as. the 17% exchange tax on the first draft and&nbsp; P808.75&nbsp; on the&nbsp; second draft.&nbsp; This imposition was ruled by the lower court as improper for it would be an impairment of an existing obligation and would deprive said defendant of a vested right.<br><br>Alleging that a letter of credit is&nbsp; not a contract of sale but a contract of loan, appellant maintained that it is only at the time that the draft drawn under said letter of credit is actually paid by the importer to the accommodating bank (Philippine National Bank) that the foreign exchange is sold. It is the Bank's assertion that neither the establishment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the letter&nbsp; of credit nor the negotiation by the correspondent Bank of the draft drawn against said letter of credit, or the release of the goods under trust receipt that the sale of foreign&nbsp; exchange show that the sate of foreign exchange has taken place, for although the goods had been released, until the accepted draft is fully liquidated and paid, title to&nbsp; the goods or&nbsp; proceeds thereof&nbsp; remains with&nbsp; the&nbsp; bank opening the letter&nbsp; of credit.<br><br>The drafts in the case at bar are foreign bills of exchange drawn in Chicago, Illinois, and&nbsp; payable in the Philippines by the corporation against whose credit they were charged. As such negotiable instruments, when the&nbsp; drafts&nbsp; (Exhs. B and&nbsp; F)&nbsp; were unconditionally accepted by defendant as drawee, the latter became primarily liable thereon for their respective&nbsp; values (Sec. 62,&nbsp; Negotiable Instruments Law; Union Guaranty Co.<i> vs. </i>Jing Kee &amp; Co., 44&nbsp; Phil. 533). The&nbsp; liabilities of the defendant corporation, therefore, became fixed and liquidated in favor of the bank&nbsp; on June 16, 1950, for the&nbsp; first draft and on September 16, 1950, on the second, although they were&nbsp; collectible&nbsp; on the respective dates they were to become due.&nbsp; But before&nbsp; said corporation was able to settle these obligations&nbsp; fully, in&nbsp; the interim,&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 601&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; enacted&nbsp; which prescribes:<br><blockquote>"SECTION&nbsp; 1. Except as&nbsp; herein otherwise provided,&nbsp; there. shall be assessed, collected and paid&nbsp; a special excise tax of&nbsp; seventeen <i>per centum</i>: (17%)&nbsp; on the value&nbsp; in Philippine peso of foreign exchange sold and/or&nbsp; authorized to&nbsp; be sold by the Central Bank of the Philippines or any of its agents during the period of two years counted from the date of the approval of this Act."<br></blockquote>As provided by Section 7 thereof, the&nbsp; Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines in enforcing said special&nbsp; excise tax, laid down&nbsp; the policy of charging 17%&nbsp; thereof on all foreign&nbsp; exchanges not yet paid&nbsp; 'at the time said law was approved, without distinction as to whether the obligation matured before or after the&nbsp; effectivity of that measure.<br><br>As defendant Union Books, Inc., agreed to the condition that:<br><blockquote>"1. For sight draft (s) drawn under or purporting to be drawn Tinder the Credit: <i>to pay&nbsp; on demand in Philippine legal currency,</i> THE EQUIVALENT&nbsp; OF THE AMOUNT (s)&nbsp; OF SUCH DRAFT&nbsp; (S) AT THE RATE&nbsp; OF EXCHANGE&nbsp; YOU MAY FIX."<br></blockquote>when it applied for those two commercial&nbsp; letters&nbsp; of credit, appellant Bank now claims that since a foreign&nbsp; exchange is only&nbsp; considered&nbsp; sold or liquidated&nbsp; after&nbsp; it is fully&nbsp; paid, and as defendant admittedly has not yet satisfied&nbsp; its afore-mentioned&nbsp; obligations, said&nbsp; remaining liabilities&nbsp; become subject to the imposition of this tax.<br><br>Due to bad financial situation,&nbsp; defendant Union Books, Inc., failed to pay its attorney of record the necessary fees for his&nbsp; professional&nbsp; services so this&nbsp; case was submitted for decision without&nbsp; appellee's&nbsp; brief.&nbsp; From the pleadings and records on hand,&nbsp; We find that there is no&nbsp; question that defendant Union Books, Inc., is bound&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay to the Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank <i>the&nbsp; equivalent</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; $13,712.94 and $2,357.73 drawn by Frank C. Rachal, Jr.&nbsp; under the drafts Exhibits B and F after deducting the part payments&nbsp; made by&nbsp; said&nbsp; corporation,&nbsp; in&nbsp; Philippine pesos.<br><br>We&nbsp; will&nbsp; now proceed to&nbsp; consider the only&nbsp; question&nbsp; at issue in this case, which has been&nbsp; propounded in preceding; pages, to wit: Was there a sale of foreign exchange in the case at bar and, if&nbsp; so, could the 17% special&nbsp; excise tax&nbsp; be imposed upon&nbsp; drafts&nbsp; Exhibits B and F, duly&nbsp; executed and accepted before the effectivity&nbsp; of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 601?<br><br>This Court already made a ruling on this point when&nbsp; in the case of&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; C. Zulueta&nbsp; (<i>supra</i>, p.&nbsp; 1071),&nbsp; it was said:<br><blockquote>"There are decisions in America&nbsp; to&nbsp; the effect that,&nbsp; <i>'the rate&nbsp; of exchange in effect at&nbsp; the time the bill&nbsp; should have been paid</i>' controls.&nbsp; (11 C. J. S.&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 264,)<br><br>"Such decisions agree with the provisions of the. Bills&nbsp; of&nbsp; Exchange Act of&nbsp; England&nbsp; and could&nbsp; be taken&nbsp; as enunciating the correct principle, inasmuch as our Negotiable&nbsp; Instruments Law practically copies the American Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law,&nbsp; which in turn was based largely on the. Bills of&nbsp; Exchange Act of England of 1882.&nbsp; In fact we&nbsp; practically followed this rule in&nbsp; Westminster Bank <i>vs. </i> K.&nbsp; Nassoor,&nbsp; 58 Phil. 855.<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"Now then, Zulueta's&nbsp; obligation having been incurred before the creation of the 17% tax, it may not be validly burdened&nbsp; with such tax, because&nbsp; the&nbsp; law imposing it could not be deemed to have impaired obligations already existing at the&nbsp; time of its approval".<br></blockquote>In the case&nbsp; at bar, defendant was&nbsp; similarly situated, its&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; having been incurred and had matured before the enactment of the law,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; therefore, must also be exonerated from the liabilities imposed thereon.&nbsp; But appellant argued that to allow such exemption would defeat the purpose of that law for the&nbsp; proponents&nbsp; of the measure intended this impost&nbsp; to cover all obligations not yet fully paid at the&nbsp; time of the. enactment.&nbsp; The same discussions on the then proposed measure appearing in the Congressional Records also contain the following:<br><blockquote>"Mr.&nbsp; ZOSA. The gentleman&nbsp; from&nbsp; Tarlac is&nbsp; proposing an amendment which would&nbsp; make this Act applicable to the sale of foreign exchange&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of its approval, is that the idea?<br><br>"Mr.&nbsp; ROY. Right.<br><br>"Mr.&nbsp; ZOSA. Now, take&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; a license to import a certain article&nbsp; which was&nbsp; issued before the approval&nbsp; of this Act.&nbsp; Does that case fall within the purview&nbsp; of Hie amendment&nbsp; proposed&nbsp; by the gentleman from Tarlac,&nbsp; so that the tax which is sought&nbsp; to be collected under this measure may&nbsp; not be collected therefrom?<br><br>"Mr.&nbsp; ROY. The proposed&nbsp; measure, if approved,&nbsp; <i>will not&nbsp; cover foreign exchanges .that have&nbsp; been sold by the Central Bank 'prior to the approval of this Act or prior to the signing of this Act by the Chief Executive."</i>&nbsp; (Congressional Record, Vol.&nbsp; I, No.&nbsp; 8, p. 1095).<br></blockquote>and the&nbsp; statements quoted by&nbsp; appellant in its&nbsp; brief refer to articles the import license&nbsp; of which was&nbsp; issued before the approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Act.&nbsp; Certainly, the import&nbsp; license which only carries with it the&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; buy&nbsp; foreign exchange and the foreign exchange itself&nbsp; are two different things.<br><br>We&nbsp; may agree with&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; Central Bank that the transactions entered into between the Philippine National Bank&nbsp; and the defendant Union Books, Inc., present the characteristics of contracts of&nbsp; loan, but in the case at bar, We cannot subscribe to appellant's assertion that it is only at the time that the drafts were actually paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; the importer to&nbsp; the accommodating&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; (Philippine National Bank), that the foreign&nbsp; exchange is sold, because&nbsp; we find that in the instant case&nbsp; there&nbsp; was no sale of foreign currency&nbsp; as&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; never&nbsp; bound itself&nbsp; to purchase any&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; currency to settle the&nbsp; obligations it contracted with the Philippine National Bank which were only to pay in the City of Manila, at the time of maturity of said drafts (Exhs.&nbsp; D and&nbsp; H) and at a time when Republic Act No. 601 was not yet in force, <i>the equivalent in Philippine pesos of the amounts involved in said 2 drafts,</i> a liability which&nbsp; did&nbsp; not require from said defendant to purchase any&nbsp; foreign currency.&nbsp; In his concurring opinion in said case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank <i>vs. </i>Zulueta, (supra, p. 1071) the writer of this decision already stated:<br><blockquote>"The obligation contracted by&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; was not&nbsp; to pay §14,419.15 <i>in dollars</i>, but the <i>equivalent</i> of&nbsp; 14,419.15 dollars in Philippine currency. So when&nbsp; defendant's obligation matured on October 4, 1949, (before the enactment of Republic Act No. 601),&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant had to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; to the Bank not the sum of&nbsp; $14,467.15 representing the face value of the draft Exhibit A, plus $18.06 and 1/8 of 1% commission,<i> but its&nbsp; equivalent m pesos at lite time of such maturity,</i> and had the defendant failed to satisfy then his obligation, he could&nbsp; be liable to pay in addition thereof,&nbsp; the corresponding interest for the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; default and nothing else".<br></blockquote><i>Wherefore,</i>&nbsp; and in the light of the foregoing considerations, the&nbsp; decision appealed from is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with the&nbsp; understanding&nbsp; that the defendant corporation is also sentenced&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; interests&nbsp; on the&nbsp; amounts due by the&nbsp;&nbsp; Union Books, Inc., at the time of&nbsp; the maturity&nbsp; of the drafts, Exhibits B and F, for the whole period of default in the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; to costs. It&nbsp; is so&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Bautista Angelo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br>REYES, A.,<i> J.:</i><br><br>I&nbsp;&nbsp; concur&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; my concurring opinion in G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-7271 Philippine National&nbsp; Bank <i>vs.</i> Jose C.

If that is the agreement, then the Bank had&nbsp; the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; charge the exchange tax,&nbsp; since in reality its imposition&nbsp; represents&nbsp; an alteration of the exchange rate between the dollar&nbsp; and the peso, as&nbsp; pointed&nbsp; out in the dissent&nbsp; to&nbsp; Bank<i> vs.</i> Zulueta, supra.<br><br><i>Endencia</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
