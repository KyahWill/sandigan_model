				<BR><STRONG>KAPUNAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On January 12,&nbsp; 19S2,&nbsp; the plaintiff-appellant, a civilian employee&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Police Department,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a series of&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; charges against&nbsp; defendant-appellee&nbsp; a major&nbsp; and administrative officer&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Department. Nine of the twelve&nbsp; charges&nbsp;&nbsp; were found to be without basis, and&nbsp; as to the other three charges no&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; was filed by the City&nbsp; Mayor&nbsp; (since&nbsp; the submission of the recommendation&nbsp; of the investigating&nbsp; committee)&nbsp; with the Municipal&nbsp; Board.&nbsp; On May 3, 1952,&nbsp; while said charges were under investigation by&nbsp; the proper committee, the appellee filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; suit in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; (Civil Case No.&nbsp; 16439) against the&nbsp; appellant for damages allegedly&nbsp; arising from the series of administrative charges filed&nbsp; against&nbsp; him.&nbsp; On&nbsp; May&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1952, the appellant, without&nbsp; filing&nbsp; an answer, moved&nbsp; to dismiss appellee's complaint.&nbsp; The court dismissed the same for being premature.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellee appealed but&nbsp; his appeal&nbsp; was dismissed for failure&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the docketing fee&nbsp; and the printing deposit.&nbsp;&nbsp; On November 4, 1954, almost two years after the dismissal of Civil Case&nbsp; No. 16439, the&nbsp; appellant filed the present complaint for damages, alleging as it basis the malicious and unfounded complaint against&nbsp; him filed by the&nbsp; appellee in&nbsp; said&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 16439.&nbsp; On appellee's motion, the lower court dismissed the complaint for lack of&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of action.&nbsp; A&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration having been&nbsp; denied, the plaintiff has taken the instant appeal.<br><br>The appellant has assigned the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol><li> THE LOWER&nbsp; COURT&nbsp; ERRED&nbsp; IN&nbsp; HO I" JUNG&nbsp; THAT&nbsp; PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT'S FAILURE TO SET AS&nbsp; A COUNTERCLAIM IN&nbsp; CIVIL CASE NO. 16439, FLORENCIO CATINDIG VS. JAIME G. VILLANUEVA HIS PRESENT CLAIM&nbsp; FOR FOR IMAGES AGAINST&nbsp; THE&nbsp; APPELLEE IS A&nbsp; EAR&nbsp; TO&nbsp; HIS INSTANT&nbsp; ACTION.<br><br></li><li> THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE&nbsp; FIRST&nbsp; MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT&nbsp; AND IN DISMISSING THIS CASE ALLEGEDLY FOR LACK&nbsp; OF CAUSE OF&nbsp; ACTION FOR THE REASON,&nbsp; AS&nbsp; IT&nbsp; STATED, THAT&nbsp; 'CIVIL&nbsp; OASE&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; 16430,&nbsp; FLORENCIO CATINDIG&nbsp; VS.&nbsp; JAIME&nbsp; G.&nbsp; VILLANUEVA,&nbsp; FOR&nbsp; DAMAGES, WHICH&nbsp; WAS DISMISSED AND&nbsp; UPON WHICH&nbsp; THE&nbsp; PRESENT&nbsp; ACTION&nbsp; IS&nbsp; RASED,&nbsp; IS NOT&nbsp; ONE&nbsp; OF THOSE&nbsp; CASES&nbsp; SPECIFIED IN THE CIVIL CODG WHERKIN MORAL DAMAGES&nbsp; MAY BE RECOVERED.'<br><br></li><li> THE LOWER&nbsp; COURT&nbsp; LIKEWISE ERRED IN DENYING THE&nbsp; SECOND MOTION FOR&nbsp; RECONSIDERATION&nbsp; FILED&nbsp; RY PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT&nbsp; IN THIS CASE FOR&nbsp; LACK OF MERITS AND&nbsp; IN&nbsp; HOLDING THAT IT IS AT A 'LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE FILING OF CIVIL CASE NO. 16439 WOULD BE CONTRARY TO&nbsp; MORALS, GOOD&nbsp; CUSTOMS,&nbsp; OR PUBLIC POLICY, ESPECIALLY&nbsp; TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE CASE WAS DISMISSED BECAUSE OF A PREJUDICIAL QUESTION.'<br><br></li><li> THE LOWER COURT ERRED&nbsp; IN&nbsp; DISMISSING&nbsp; THE&nbsp; COMPLAINT FILED IN THIS CASE WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION." <br></li></ol></blockquote>We are&nbsp; of&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; that the&nbsp; appealed order&nbsp; is not erroneous.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; present&nbsp; complaint was filed&nbsp; because of the previous suit filed by the appellee against the appellant (Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 16439).&nbsp; The latter case was&nbsp; dismissed not&nbsp; for want&nbsp; of&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action, but&nbsp; because the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; considered&nbsp; that, inasmuch as&nbsp; the determination of the&nbsp; administrative case&nbsp; was a&nbsp; prejudicial&nbsp; question,&nbsp; no cause&nbsp; of action yet existed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court&nbsp; thus said:<br><blockquote>"II. The determination of the administrative case is a prejudicial question; that is, facts&nbsp; charged&nbsp; and&nbsp; quoted&nbsp; by plaintiff are so in separably connected with this administrative case so much&nbsp; so that with the absence of any result of said&nbsp; administrative case it&nbsp; is PREMATURE to advance&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; that&nbsp; charges&nbsp; there are unfounded,&nbsp; as plaintiff&nbsp; did."<br><br>"Viewed&nbsp; from&nbsp; all. angles,&nbsp; no cause of action will He&nbsp; against defendant Jaime&nbsp; Villanueva at&nbsp; this stage of the&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case, and a cause of&nbsp; action depends&nbsp; upon the result of the administrative&nbsp; case still pending: before an&nbsp; administrative body."</blockquote>We&nbsp; agree with the&nbsp; appellee that the mere filing of a civil case is not in itself malicious&nbsp; or&nbsp; contrary to morals, good custom or public&nbsp; policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that articles&nbsp; 21, 2217 and 2219 of the&nbsp; new Civil Code provide for&nbsp; moral damages&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; undue prosecution;&nbsp; but they should not be&nbsp; so construed&nbsp; as to encourage&nbsp; or&nbsp; sanction endless actions for damages&nbsp; where, as&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case, a complaint is dismissed on a&nbsp; mere technicality, not after trial on the merits,&nbsp; and&nbsp; without&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence and legality of the alleged wrongful acts.<br><br>It should be remembered that the appellee was exonerated from the administrative&nbsp; charges against him.&nbsp; This fact sustains appellee's contention that when he filed Civil Case No. 16439,&nbsp; he&nbsp; was not prompted by malice&nbsp; or prejudice. The&nbsp; same&nbsp; fact should also&nbsp;&nbsp; warrant&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court's refusal&nbsp; to hold that the filing of Civil Case No. 16439 was contrary to morals, good custom or public policy.<br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; order&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; appellant's complaint&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; So ordered,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J. B.&nbsp; L., Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
