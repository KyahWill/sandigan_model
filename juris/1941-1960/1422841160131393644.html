				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an appeal by the Republic of the Philippines from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing&nbsp; its complaint&nbsp; to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; from, appellees Pio Pedrosa and&nbsp; Alfredo V, Jacinto&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P68,933.91, representing alleged losses or damages to the Government because of certain&nbsp; supposedly&nbsp; unlawful acts&nbsp; of appellees committed when they were still Secretary of&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; and Commissioner of Customs, respectively.<br><br>&nbsp;The&nbsp; facts are narrated by the Court below, as follows:<br><blockquote>"The facts, upon which the claim of the plaintiff is predicated&nbsp; may be stated as follows: In a decision rendered by the Commissioner of Customs on December 23, 1947, in customs&nbsp; ease entitled&nbsp; "Republic of tho Philippines<i> vs.</i> 259 Pieces of Jewelry, Tranquilino Rovero, Owner;&nbsp; Identification No. 555,'&nbsp; it was&nbsp; held that the&nbsp; 259 pieces of jewelry&nbsp; imported by&nbsp; Tranquilino Royero were properly seized under Section&nbsp; 1292 of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code and are&nbsp; subject to forfeiture under Section 1363 (<i>m</i>~2) of the same Code.&nbsp; However, forfeiture was waived&nbsp; and in&nbsp; Hen thereof&nbsp; a fine,&nbsp; in an amount .equal to three times&nbsp; the appraised value, P23,736,&nbsp; of the jewelry was&nbsp; imposed.<br><br>Tranquilino Bovero appealed&nbsp; to the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; where the decision of&nbsp; the Commissioner of&nbsp; Customs&nbsp; was affirmed in its judgment of May 24, 1949. Rovero appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the&nbsp; judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance in a&nbsp; decision rendered on June 28, 1951, in. case G. R.&nbsp; No. L-3281&nbsp; (Republic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines<i>&nbsp; vs. </i>259 Pieces&nbsp; of Jewelry; Tranquilino&nbsp; Rovero, defendant-appellant).<br><br>On August 8, 1951,&nbsp; the defendant Alfredo V, Jacinto, then Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs,&nbsp; upon request of Tranquilino Rovero, ordered the Collector of Customs for the Fort of Manila to form a committee to reappraise said&nbsp; jewelry.&nbsp; A reappraisal was made, as a result of which&nbsp; the original&nbsp; appraised&nbsp; value of P23.736&nbsp; was reduced to P9,880.&nbsp; The defendant Pio Pedrosa, then Secretary of Finance, on August 23, 1951, set aside the original appraised value and approved the new appraisement of P9,880 and this reduced value&nbsp; was made the "basis of the payment of the fine imposed by the Commissioner of Customs in&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid decision, notwithstanding the fact that said decision had already been affirmed by the Supreme Court,&nbsp; as a result of which Tranquilino Rovero recovered the&nbsp; jewelry and&nbsp; only paid the&nbsp; government&nbsp; three&nbsp; times&nbsp; this&nbsp; new appraised&nbsp; value,&nbsp; or P29,640, plus tax, duties, and other charges amounting; all together to P38,303.55.<br><br>Execution was issued in Civil Case No, 4450 for the collection of the fine imposed therein, together with customs duties,&nbsp; sales&nbsp; tax, and&nbsp; other charges&nbsp; aggregating" P107,787.49. However, the jewelry having been recovered&nbsp; by Tranquilino Rovero upon payment of the amount of P38,303.55, a writ of execution was issued for the balance of P69,483,94.&nbsp; Execution was&nbsp; levied&nbsp; on Rovero's&nbsp; properties,&nbsp; and only the sum of P550.03 was realized, so that there is now an unpaid balance&nbsp; of P68.933.91 of said judgment, which is&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; now claimed by the&nbsp; plaintiff from the defendants." (Record on Appeal, pp. 185-128.)<br></blockquote>The lower court found that&nbsp; appellees acted contrary to law and&nbsp; in an unwarranted interference with the already final judgment of this&nbsp; Court in&nbsp; G. R. L-3281&nbsp; when they allowed a reappraisal of&nbsp; the jewerly in question, thereby reducing by&nbsp; some&nbsp; P69,000.00&nbsp; the fine which&nbsp; was&nbsp; to be paid by&nbsp; the&nbsp; importer Tranquilino Rovero,&nbsp; the fine&nbsp; being triple the appraised value.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the court also held that the fine imposable on Rovero was, under the provisions of the Revised Administrative Code, a "fine upon the property" seized and&nbsp; not upon the owner; that had the jewerly not&nbsp; been reappraised, Rovero would not&nbsp; have redeemed them, and their&nbsp; sale at&nbsp; public auction would bring&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; no more than their original appraised&nbsp; value of P23,736.00; and that therefore, the Government did not suffer any losses or damages when Rovero was authorized by&nbsp; appellees to pay&nbsp; a&nbsp; fine of P38,853.58, and dismissed the complaint.<br><br>In its appeal from the foregoing' judgment, the Republic, through the Solicitor&nbsp; General, urges that Rovero could be held personally&nbsp; liable beyond&nbsp; the&nbsp; value of the jewelry in question for the balance of the fine payable by him based on the original appraised value of the jewelry in question.<br><br>Government&nbsp; counsel seem to be&nbsp; of the impression that as long as the&nbsp; importer Rovero could be made to answer for the fines,&nbsp; duties, and&nbsp; charges&nbsp; imposed upon&nbsp; him&nbsp; by law by reason of his illegal&nbsp; importation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; jewelry in question, over and beyond their actual value, the cause of action against appellees for losses&nbsp; or damages in the amount of P68,983.91 is complete and should be sustained by&nbsp; us.&nbsp; We do not agree&nbsp; with the Government's position. To recover the damages it is after, the Republic must show that the alleged misconduct of the appellees Pedrosa&nbsp; and Jacinto was the proximate cause of the failure to recover in full from Tranquilino&nbsp; Rovero the latter's&nbsp; original liability of P107,791.44; or, what amounts to the same thing, the appellant must establish by satisfactory evidence that its inability to recover the deficiency of P68,933.91 was the natural and probable consequence&nbsp; of the conduct of appellees in permitting a reappraisal of the imported&nbsp; jewelry. For the causal relation&nbsp; between defendants' fault and the damages suffered is&nbsp; an&nbsp; indispensable requisite&nbsp; for&nbsp; the recovery of such damages&nbsp; (Algarra<i> vs.</i> Sandejas,&nbsp; 27 Phil. 284).&nbsp; Hence, to prove&nbsp; its damages, it is not enough that. the Government should show that Rovero&nbsp; could&nbsp; be held personally&nbsp; answerable for the difference of the fine&nbsp; and duties&nbsp; payable&nbsp; by&nbsp; him;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government must&nbsp; likewise prove&nbsp; that it&nbsp; could&nbsp; have&nbsp; recovered&nbsp; from&nbsp; Rovero said difference, but was&nbsp; prevented from doing&nbsp; so because of appellee's acts.<br><br>But&nbsp; there is absolutely no&nbsp; proof&nbsp; to&nbsp; this effect.&nbsp; The Government has not shown that, at the time the reappraisal of Rovero's jewelry was ordered by the&nbsp; appellees, Rovero had sufficient property to cover his full liability under the original appraisal and order of seizure. The records show that subsequently, after&nbsp; judgment was rendered in G. R. L-3281 Rovero's properties were levied upon and sold, but only P550.03 was realized out of&nbsp; them; and there is neither charge nor proof that&nbsp; in the interval Rovero was enabled to dispose or spirit away any&nbsp; of his property.&nbsp; And if Rovero&nbsp; never had the&nbsp; means&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; deficiency of P68,933.71, we can not see how the appellees can be held liable therefor; for the loss&nbsp; would have been incurred any way, even if the original appraisal had not been disturbed.<br><br>As correctly pointed&nbsp; out for appellee&nbsp; Fedrosa,&nbsp; he&nbsp; and Jacinto did not become guarantors of Rovero's solvency by the mere fact of their&nbsp; having authorized&nbsp; and approved, the reappraisal of the jewelry in question.<br><br>As to the&nbsp; jewelry,&nbsp; the Government has&nbsp; not produced evidence that it could have obtained, at a forced sale,&nbsp; more than their original appraised value of P23.736.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; since Rovero&nbsp; ultimately paid&nbsp; P38,303.55 under&nbsp; the reappraisal in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; redeem the jewelry,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; evident that&nbsp; its return caused no loss.<br><br>We reaffirm our ruling in Rovero <i>vs.</i> Amparo,<font color="#ff0000">*</font> G. R. L- 9462, May 5, 1952,&nbsp; that administrative officials have no power to remit&nbsp; fines&nbsp; or forfeitures after the&nbsp; courts, on appeal and in final&nbsp; decisions, have sanctioned&nbsp; such&nbsp; fines and forfeitures.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of&nbsp; charge or proof of conspiracy, and of&nbsp; any showing that the acts of appellees Pedrosa&nbsp; and Jacinto were the proximate cause of the Government's loss&nbsp; of revenue,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; committed no error&nbsp; in absolving the defendants-appellees.<br><br>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.<br><br>No costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><font color="#ff0000">*</font> 91 Phil., 228</div>
