				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On May 3, 1943, the plaintiff Silvio R. Viola obtained from the 
defendant Fernando Busuego a loan of P35,000.00, and to secure the payment of 
said amount the former executed a deed of mortgage (Exh. A) of fifteen parcels 
of land situated in Bulacan in favor of the latter, which provides in its 
paragraphs 3 and 4 following:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"3. <i>That the principal of P35,000.00 shall be repaid within 
the period of three (3) years from the date hereof with interest at the rate of 
eight per cent (8%) per annum payable annually in advance</i>, the first payment 
of said interest to commence on the date of this instrument and the subsequent 
payments on the same date of every year thereafter.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. <i>That the mortgagor binds himself, if the mortgagee so 
desires, not to redeem the mortgaged properties, during the continuanoe of this 
mortgage</i>, but the mortgagee reserves his right to terminate the same and 
take steps for its foreclosure, judicially or extra-judicially in accordance 
with the provisions of Act 3135, as amended, upon default of the mortgagor to 
pay the stipulated annual interest on its maturity, and upon violation on the 
part of said mortgagor of any of the conditions herein stipulated."—<i>Exhibit 
A</i>. (italics ours).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Subsequently, on July 3, 1943, additional security and partial 
release of some of the properties mortgaged were agreed upon by the parties in 
another instrument (Exh. B), subject to the same terms and conditions stipulated 
in the deed of mortgage Exhibit A, part of which is quoted above.</p>
<p align="justify">On November 12, 1943, plaintiff Viola, without the knowledge 
and consent of the defendant Busuego, executed a deed of sale in favor of the 
other plaintiff-appellant Potanciano Ilusorio of five parcels of land, mortgaged 
to the defendant, and Ilusorio assumed the obligation to pay Viola's obligation 
or debt to the defendant Busuego under the terms and conditions stipulated in 
the above quoted deed of mortgage.</p>
<p align="justify">On April 27 and July 5, 1944, the plaintiff Ilusorio tendered 
to defendant Busuego the sum of P40,638.58, in payments of the Viola's debt with 
interest accrued and to accrue up to May 3, 1946; and as the latter refused to 
accept it on the ground that according to paragraph 4 of the deed of mortgage, 
"the mortgagor binds himself, if the mortgagee so desires, not to redeem the 
mortgaged properties during the continuance of this mortgage," the plaintiffs 
deposited the money in the court and filed a complaint against the defendant to 
compel him to accept the payment.</p>
<p align="justify">The defendant alleged in his answer as special defense that, 
according to the deed of mortgage, the plaintiff Silverio R. Viola bound 
himself, if the mortgagee so desires, not to redeem the mortgage during the 
continuance of the mortgage, and filed a counterclaim against the plaintiffs to 
pay the sum of P2,800.00 as interest of the debt for one year from May 3, 1944, 
to May 3, 1945, with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum.</p>
<p align="justify">After trial, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered 
judgment on August 30, 1944, dismissing the plaintiffs' action on the ground 
that, according to paragraph 4 of the deed of mortgage, the plaintiffs oould not 
redeem the property mortgaged without the consent of the defendant before the 
expiration of the period of three years, and sentencing the former to pay the 
latter the sum of P2,800.00 with interest at 8 per cent per annum from May 3, to 
July 5, 1944, with costs against the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the lower court, 
and the question for us now to determine is whether, under the provisions of 
paragraphs 3 and 4 of the deed of mortgage, the plaintiffs-appellants have the 
right to compel the defendant-appellee to accept the payment of the debt before 
the expiration of the period of three years stipulated in the deed of 
mortgage.</p>
<p align="justify">We are of the considered opinion, and so hold, that the lower 
oourt is right in deciding that, according to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 
mortgage, the appellants oould not pay the debt and redeem the mortgage before 
the expiration of the period of three years, without the consent of the 
defendant appellee.</p>
<p align="justify">According to Sec. 59, Rule 123, of the Rules of Court, "In the 
construction of an instrument where there are several provisions or particulars, 
such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all"; 
and the only construction which may be adopted to give effect to the provisions 
of both paragraphs (3) and (4) of the deed of mortgage above quoted, is that the 
mortgage debt shall be payable at the expiration of three years, but it may be 
paid before the expiration of the period if the creditor consents to accept the 
payment; because otherwise, or to construe the deed in the sense that the 
mortgagor has the right to pay the debt within or before the expiration of the 
period of three years, would be to give no effect to the pertinent provision of 
paragraph 4 of the deed of mortgage.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, the appealed judgment is affirmed 
with costs against the appellants.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>PARAS, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">As correctly pointed out by the majority, in the construction 
of an instrument where there are several provisions or particulars, such a 
construction is, if possible to be adopted as will give effect to all (Rule of 
Court No. 123, section 59). Under paragraph 3 of the mortgage in question, the 
debtor shall (not merely "may") repay the loan within a period of three years. 
Upon the other hand, it is provided in the succeeding paragraph 4 that "the 
mortgagor binds himself, it the mortgagee so desires, not to redeem the 
mortgaged properties, during the continuance of this mortgage." The majority 
have ruled that the mortgagor cannot pay the debt before the expiration of three 
years without the consent of the mortgagee,—a construction that obviously gives 
effect only to paragraph 4 in utter disregard of paragraph 3 and, hence, in 
contravention of the very rule invoked by them. In my opinion, a reverse 
interpretation is, under the facts of this case, not only fair and equitable but 
conformable to the rule of construction embodied in section 59 of Rule of Court 
No. 123. In other words, I hold that the mortgagor has the right to pay the 
indebtedness at any time within three years provided that, as in this case, he 
pays the interest for whole term of the mortgage. In the ordinary course of 
things, a loan is granted in consideration of interest, and if by the early 
payment of the obligation, the creditor would not lose any part of the 
stipulated interest, both paragraph 3 and 4 would practically be enforced. It 
cannot be alleged that the creditor herein, in addition to interest, wanted to 
have his money in the safekeeping of the debtor, because the contract is one of 
loan and not of deposit. It is to be remembered, moreover, that the debt was 
being paid in the same currency loaned (Japanese money). The effect of inflation 
is one of the risks naturally incident to the money-lending business, and the 
lender should protect himself against it by plain covenants.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, I vote for the reversal of the 
appealed judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">PADILLA, J.:</p> I concur in this dissent.</div>
