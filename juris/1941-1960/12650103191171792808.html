				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Rodolfo&nbsp; Paterno y Manuel, for&nbsp; throwing a&nbsp; cigarette butt at Plaza Miranda, was accused of violation of Section 1158&nbsp; (anti-littering)&nbsp; of Revised Ordinance&nbsp; 1600&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp; Found guilty&nbsp; by the Municipal Court and, on appeal, by the Court of First Instance of Manila, he was convicted and fined by the latter court in the sum of&nbsp; P20.00,&nbsp;&nbsp; pursuant to Section&nbsp; 1262&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Ordinance.<br><div align="justify"><br>Appellant, while not <i>directly</i> questioning the legality of the ordinance as it is, nor his conviction under the facts of the case, nor the penalty imposed upon him, has, however, appealed&nbsp; and now assails the&nbsp; constitutionality&nbsp; of what&nbsp; he&nbsp; calls&nbsp; the operation or implementation of&nbsp; the ordinance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; his assignment of errors:<br><ol start="2"> <li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT REVISED ORDINANCE NO.&nbsp; 1600,&nbsp; SECTION 1158&nbsp; IS&nbsp; LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL&nbsp; ON ITS&nbsp; FACE, INSTEAD ON THE WAY IT IS&nbsp; OPERATED.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED&nbsp; IN HOLDING&nbsp; THAT REVISED ORDINANCE NO. 1600, SECTION 1168, AS OPERATED, IS NOT&nbsp; UNDULY&nbsp; OPPRESSIVE&nbsp; UPON&nbsp; THE&nbsp; INDIVIDUAL.<br></li></ol>He complains that the members of the Manila Police Department, in enforcing the ordinance, immediately arrest and detain for one hour and not exceeding six hours, as was due in his particular case,&nbsp; all violators of the&nbsp; ordinance,&nbsp; instead&nbsp; of&nbsp; merely serving them with a summons or&nbsp; ticket for their appearance&nbsp; in&nbsp; court, as provided in Section 43&nbsp; of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 409 (Charter of Manila) for violation&nbsp; of any ordinance.&nbsp; As thus&nbsp; enforced, appellant submits&nbsp; that&nbsp; the ordinance, although reasonable&nbsp; on its face, becomes unreasonable and&nbsp; oppressive and, therefore, illegal and unconstitutional.<br><br>The&nbsp; flaw in&nbsp; this argument is that appellant confuses the <span style="font-style: italic;">application or&nbsp; operation</span> of the ordinance as it is, and the act of the police&nbsp; officers in&nbsp; the performance of&nbsp; their functions&nbsp; as&nbsp; such&nbsp; in connection with the apprehension and prosecution of&nbsp; its&nbsp; violators.&nbsp;&nbsp; This misapprehension on&nbsp; the part&nbsp; of the appellant is made evident when&nbsp; he states in his brief:<br><blockquote>The issue boils down to that part of&nbsp; Section 37, Republic&nbsp; Act No. 409, Charter, of Manila, which provides that&nbsp; peace officers have the power 'to arrest or cause to be&nbsp; arrested, without warrant of arrest,&nbsp; any offender&nbsp; when the offense&nbsp; is committed in&nbsp; their presence or&nbsp; within their view' ".&nbsp; (Appellant's brief, page 4).<br></blockquote>The arrest was not a part of the offense or violation for which the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; was tried and convicted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 1158 of the Revised Ordinances does not provide for or indicate the manner by which the infractors&nbsp; or violators thereof would be arrested and prosecuted.&nbsp;&nbsp; It merely specifies the acts that&nbsp; would constitute "littering", which acts&nbsp; shall be punishable&nbsp; as misdemeanors pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 1262 of the Revised&nbsp; Ordinances.&nbsp; How the violators&nbsp; are to&nbsp; be dealt with and brought&nbsp; to court are procedural matters entirely foreign to&nbsp; the ordinance&nbsp; itself, and the legality or illegality of the procedure followed by the law enforcement agencies in cases of violations of said ordinance can not affect&nbsp; its validity&nbsp; or&nbsp; legality.<br><br>The legal situation where, while a municipal&nbsp; ordinance or regulation is reasonable on its face, it may&nbsp; be unreasonable or oppressive&nbsp; in its operation in a particular instance and, therefore, unenforceable therein, is illustrated in the case of City&nbsp; of Acworth <i>vs.</i> Western &amp; A. R. Co. (159 Ga. 610; 126 SE 454).&nbsp; There, the city, in pursuance to the general welfare clause&nbsp; of its charter,&nbsp; enacted an ordinance&nbsp; requiring&nbsp; all&nbsp; railroad&nbsp; companies operating through the city to keep and maintain a human watchman at all crossings where said railroads cross the public highways&nbsp; or streets of the city, for the purpose&nbsp; of warning travelers of the approach of trains.&nbsp; The railroad company filed suit&nbsp; against the city seeking to enjoin the enforcement&nbsp; of the ordinance as to the petitioner&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that it&nbsp; (the railroad company)&nbsp; had&nbsp; erected and&nbsp; was already maintaining&nbsp; a system of signals at&nbsp; such street crossings, known as wig-wags, which were as efficient,&nbsp; if not more,&nbsp; as human watchmen, in safeguarding persons and property&nbsp; passing over such&nbsp; crossings; and, further, because the employment&nbsp; of&nbsp; human&nbsp; watchmen involved much heavier&nbsp; expenditures than the installation and maintenance of&nbsp; such system of signals.&nbsp; The State Supreme Court of Georgia, in finding for the railroad company and in affirming an&nbsp; interlocutory injunction,&nbsp; declared that although&nbsp; the ordinance on&nbsp; its&nbsp; face&nbsp; was reasonable&nbsp; and within the general welfare clause its effect and operation in the case of this particular&nbsp; railroad company was unreasonable and unconstitutional.<br><br>The situation&nbsp; of herein appellant is different.&nbsp; He does not claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; anti-littering ordinance does&nbsp; not or should not apply as to him or&nbsp; as&nbsp; to the facts of the case. He does not pretend&nbsp; that the penalty provided for&nbsp; this misdemeanor,&nbsp; or that&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; on him, is unreasonable or oppressive.&nbsp; What he complains of specifically is that he was arrested,&nbsp; as allegedly all&nbsp; violators, instead of being merely served with a summons or ticket.&nbsp; It is this arrest that he assails&nbsp; as abusive and arbitrary.&nbsp; As it&nbsp; is, appellant should have directed his efforts against the particular acts&nbsp; or procedure which he&nbsp; believes to be illegal or unconstitutional and&nbsp; not&nbsp; against the instant ordinance the validity of which, at least on&nbsp; its face, he tacitly acknowledges and admits.<br><br>The judgment appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia, </span>and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Gutierrez David,&nbsp; JJ.,</span>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
