				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The following facts are not disputed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Philippine Industrial Equipment Company, later referred to as Equipment Co., is a domestic corporation&nbsp; whose articles of incorporation&nbsp; stated that&nbsp; it&nbsp; had its residence in the City of Manila, and in fact at the beginning, had its principal office in the city.&nbsp; The defendant, Philippine Milling Company, later referred to as Milling Co., is another domestic corporation which has its residence and principal office in San Jose, Mindoro.&nbsp; The Equipment&nbsp; Co. was dissolved on April 12, 1950,&nbsp; and the dissolution was approved by&nbsp; the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 1951. From September 7 to October 23,&nbsp; 1950, while the Equipment Co. was in the process of liquidation,&nbsp; it sold&nbsp; to the Milling Co. machinery and office equipment, with a total value of P6,122.46,&nbsp; which were partly paid for, leaving a balance of P2,122.46&nbsp; still unpaid.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Equipment Co. filed the&nbsp; present action in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal to recover this balance, with interest at six per cent per annum from the commencement of the action, plus twenty-five per cent of the amount as&nbsp; attorney's fees.&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; claims that it had its principal office in Makati,&nbsp; Rizal. <br><br>Without questioning the propriety and correctness&nbsp; of the claim, the Milling Co. raised the question of venue, claiming&nbsp; that the&nbsp; action should have been brought in the City of&nbsp; Manila where the&nbsp; plaintiff had its&nbsp; legal residence.&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; hearing, the trial court found that plaintiff had transferred its main&nbsp; office from Manila to&nbsp; Makati, Rizal,&nbsp; a fact&nbsp; not contracdicted by defendant, and rendered judgment sentencing the Milling Co. to pay the amount&nbsp; of the claim, namely, P2,122.46 with&nbsp; interest at&nbsp; six per cent&nbsp; per annum from September 4,1953, plus the amount of P400.00 as attorney's fees, with costs.<br><br>Appealing the&nbsp; decision to the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, the defendant Milling Co. again raised the question of venue and also the propriety of the award of attorney's fees.&nbsp; On June 25, 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, overruling&nbsp; the appellant's&nbsp; contention&nbsp; about&nbsp; improper venue, affirmed the decision with the exception&nbsp; of the amount&nbsp; of P400&nbsp; as attorney's fees, which it eliminated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Milling Co. again appealed&nbsp; to this Tribunal reiterating&nbsp; its contention that venue was improperly laid&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal.<br><br>Both the trial' court and the Court of Appeals found as&nbsp; a fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff had actually&nbsp; transferred&nbsp; its residence and its office from Manila&nbsp; to Makati, Rizal, and that at the time it filed the complaint, its actual residence was in&nbsp; the province of Rizal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellant, however, insists that inasmuch as the legal residence of the plaintiff&nbsp; was&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; in its articles&nbsp; of incorporation, which is Manila, it can change said&nbsp; legal residence only by&nbsp; amending its articles of incorporation to&nbsp; that effect, and said amendment could be made only by complying with the provisions&nbsp; of section 18 of&nbsp; the Corporation Law,&nbsp; by a majority vote of its board of directors or trustees,&nbsp; and by the vote or written assent of the stockholders representing at&nbsp; least two thirds of the subscribed capital stock of the corporation, and that a copy of the&nbsp; articles of incorporation, as amended, duly certified to be correct by the President and the Secretary of the corporation and a majority of&nbsp; the board of directors or trustees, shall be filed in the office of the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br><br>From&nbsp; the very beginning, our&nbsp; impression is that the defense of the appellant in its appeal is based entirely on a technicality.&nbsp; As already stated, it never questioned the correctness and legality of the claim against it.&nbsp; Neither did it claim, much less prove, that the filing of the action in Rizal, instead of the City of Manila, caused it any unnecessary trouble, damage, or expense.&nbsp; It is clear that' inasmuch as the defendant-appellant had its legal residence and principal&nbsp; office in Mindoro, it made no difference to it whether it&nbsp; had to appear and&nbsp; interpose&nbsp; its defense if it had any which, as already shown, it had noije, in Manila or in Pasig, Rizal, considering the close proximity of the two places.&nbsp; There is no showing, not&nbsp; even a hint, that plaintiff-appellee filed the action in Pasig, Rizal, instead of the City of Manila, just to harass the defendant. Under such circumstances, the courts are&nbsp; disposed to liberally construe the provisions of law about venue and about residence, specially since the provisions of Rule 5,&nbsp; section 1 of the Rules of Court, about venue are for the convenience of&nbsp; the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, we should&nbsp; also bear in mind that at the time that the obligation was contracted by the defendant-appellant and at the time that the present action was commenced, the plaintiff had already been dissolved and was in the process of liquidation; consequently, it would have&nbsp; been difficult, if not impossible, to&nbsp; comply strictly with the&nbsp; law as contended by&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant by amending its articles of incorporation just to state the change of residence.&nbsp; At&nbsp; that time and under such circumstances, there is no&nbsp; assurance that, in view of the dissolution of the plaintiff, it&nbsp; could still have a meeting of its board of directors or&nbsp; trustees and secure the vote of stockholders representing at least two-thirds of the subscribed&nbsp; capital stock to amend its articles of incorporation, and then have a copy of the articles of&nbsp; incorporation, as amended, certified to be correct by the President and&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of the corporation and the majority of the members of the board of&nbsp; directors or trustees, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp; Frankly, we cannot look with favor upon a defense and appeal based&nbsp; on a&nbsp; pure technicality such as we have now before us, which unnecessarily took up the time of two appellate courts, and delayed the&nbsp; giving of appropriate relief to the plaintiff by more than three years, considering that the&nbsp; decision of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant was rendered on November 13, 1953.<br><br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court awarding the&nbsp; amount of P2,122.46 with interest at six per cent per annum from September&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1953 to the plaintiff.&nbsp; To this we agree.&nbsp; The Court of&nbsp; Appeals eliminated the amount of P400&nbsp; awarded by&nbsp; the trial court as&nbsp; attorney's fees on the ground that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; did not claim the same in his complaint, and that Article 2208 of the New Civil Code does not warrant said award.&nbsp; To this we are unable to agree.&nbsp; According to the record on appeal, plaintiff asked for the payment of&nbsp; twenty-five per cent of&nbsp; the sum due as&nbsp; attorney's fees.&nbsp; Evidently, based&nbsp; on said prayer the trial&nbsp; court granted&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P400 as&nbsp; attorney's fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; second place, Article&nbsp; 2208 of the New Civil Code, paragraph 11, provides that attorney's fees may be awarded in any case where the&nbsp; court deems it just and equitable that&nbsp; said fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.&nbsp; Under the circumstances of the case as already mentioned, we&nbsp; believe that the&nbsp; plaintiff is entitled to attorney's fees.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of the foregoing, the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with the modification that the amount of&nbsp; P400 granted by the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; as attorney's fees will&nbsp; be restored and will be&nbsp; paid by the defendant-appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; With costs.<br><br><i>Padilla, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
