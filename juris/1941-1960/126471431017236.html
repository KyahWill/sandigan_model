				<H3>THE COLLECTOR OP INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER VS. THE PHILIPPINE EDUCATION CO., INC., RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>There is no dispute  as to  the facts, since the same have been stipulated by the parties.   The Philippine Education  Co., Inc.,  respondent herein, lost  all  its pre-war books of accounts and  records, with the exception of a copy of the trial balance sheet of November 30, 1941.  The accounting firm of Dalupan, Sanchez &amp; Co.  was employed to prepare and prove respondent's  war damage claim, as in fact it did so.   On October 29, 1948, the War Damage Commission made the first payment of P402,273.96 to the respondent which paid to Dalupan,  Sanchez &amp; Co.  the sum of P13,045.48 as the  latter's stipulated fee.  In  the income tax return filed by the  respondent for  the fiscal year ending on March  31,  1949, the respondent claimed the sum of P13,045.48  as  a deduction unoler section 30 of the  National Internal Revenue Code.  Disallowing said deduction, the  Collector of Internal  Revenue,  petitioner herein, assessed against the  respondent the sum of P2,405.14 as deficiency income tax on the  amount of P13,045.48, including surcharge, penalty and interest, payment of which was demanded from the respondent.  Refusing to acquiesce in said ruling, the respondent appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals which rendered a decision reversing the view of  the, petitioner and declaring the respondent  exempt from the deficiency income tax in question.</p>
<p>The legal provision involved is section 30 of the National Internal  Revenue Code which  allows as deductions "all the ordinary  and necessary expenses  paid  or incurred during the  taxable  year in carrying  on  any  trade or business."  As pointed out by the Court of Tax Appeals, three conditions  are imposed:  (1)  The expense must be ordinary and necessary; (2) it  must be paid or incurred within the taxable year; and (3) it must be paid or incurred in carrying on a trade  or business.</p>
<p>It is admitted  that the sum of P13,045.13 was paid by the respondent to  Dalupan, Sanchez &amp;  Co. within  the fiscal year 1949.  The questions  to be decided are whether or  not the expense in question  was ordinary and necessary and whether or not it was paid or incurred in carrying on respondent's  business.</p>
<p>It is petitioner's  theory  that  the  respondent is  a corporation engaged  in the purchase and  sale of textbooks, magazines,  office  and school supplies,  and a  variety  of other  merchandise  and  commodities; that  it  was never normally  and customarily engaged in filing  petitions  for war damage  compensation; and  that, therefore, the  fee paid by it to  the  accounting firm of Dalupan,  Sanchez &amp; Co. was not incurred in the kind of  business transactions in which it is normally and customarily  engaged.</p>
<p>In our  opinion, this view is too narrow and technical. To carry on  its  business, even  as specified  by the petitioner, the respondent not only must have sufficient assets but must preserve the same and  recover any that should be lost.  The  fee  in question was paid by the  respondent to recover its  lost assets occasioned by the war  and thereby to  be  so rehabilitated as to be  able to carry on  its business.  The law  does not say that the expense  must be for or on account of transactions in one's trade or business.</p>
<p>As stated in Merten's  Law of Federal Income Taxation, Vol. IV, "ordinarily, an  expense  will be considered  necessary where  the expenditure  is appropriate  and helpful in the development of the  taxpayer's business" (page 35) ; "it is sufficient that the  expense were incurred for purposes  proper  to the conduct of  the  corporate  affairs or for the purpose of realizing a profit or of minimizing a loss" (pp. 382-383); "the term 'ordinary' as used in these statutes does  not  require that the payments be  habitual or normal in  the  sense that the  same taxpayer will have to make them often; the  payment may be unique or non-recurring to the  particular taxpayer affected"  (p.  316) ; and "attorney's fees for  services rendered in  the prosecution of claim before the Mixed  Claims Commission are deductible"  (p.  346).  There is  no essential  difference between attorney's fees  and that paid to an accountant, as regards  the benefit  derived  by  the claimant.  With particular reference to attorney's fees, the following cases were cited: Commissioner of Internal Revenue <em>vs</em>. Ullmann 77 F  (2d)  827, 296, U.S. 631, 80 L fd. 449, 56 SCR 155 (1935), and Commissioner of Internal Revenue  <em>vs</em>. Speyer 77 F  (2d)  824, 296 U. S. 631, 80 L fd. 449, 56  SCR 1955. The petitioner observes, however, that these cases are not applicable because there is  no law of the United States Federal Government exempting the proceeds of war damage claims from  taxes.  This observation is successfully answered  by the respondent  which  has  pointed out that the exemption provided in Republic Act  No. 227  is  a surplusage, because even without said statutory  exemption, a  war damage compensation  would still not  be  subject to tax,  not  being  an income.  "The  word 'income', as used in the sixteenth amendment, cannot be construed to include property other than income, even if such property is described as income by an act of Congress."  (Brewester <em>vs.</em> Walch, D. C. Conn.  268 P207,  216.)   "Compensation for injury to capital is never 'income/  no matter when collected."   (H. Liebes &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, C.  C. A.  9, 90 F 2nd 932.)</p>
<p>The petitioner also resorts to the argument that Republic Act  No.  227 gives  taxpayers  double  benefits,  namely, that of deducting from the gross income the loss sustained, and that of exempting the recovered amounts from income tax; and if  the  fees incurred  in  the recovery  of  war damage compensation can  be allowed  as a deduction,  it would work  to the great prejudice and disadvantage of the Government.  As ruled by the Court of Tax Appeals, "the questioned item represent legitimate business expense incurred in the recovery of losses and it has never been deducted by petitioner  (respondent herein) as  part of his war losses."  And  the  respondent, moreover,  add: "Besides, there is nothing in the stipulation of facts which suggest  even vaguely that there  was  in this  case  an infringement of the  double-benefit  theory. On the contrary, the respondent failed to deduct in any of its income tax returns its war  losses, and even  the  amount of its approved claim which the  United States Philippine  War Damage Commission did not pay for lack of appropriation." Wherefore, the appealed decision of the  Court of Tax Appeals is  hereby affirmed.   So ordered, without costs.</p>
