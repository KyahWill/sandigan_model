				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal by certiorari under Rule 46&nbsp; from a judgment&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; reversing&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bulacan and remanding the case for new trial.<p>As&nbsp; found by the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; Vicente Valencia applied for&nbsp; the registration of&nbsp; two&nbsp; parcels of&nbsp; land described&nbsp; in&nbsp; the application&nbsp; and plan&nbsp; attached&nbsp; thereto, claiming&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; title&nbsp; thereto&nbsp; because the spouses&nbsp;&nbsp; Laureano&nbsp; Marquez&nbsp; anti&nbsp; Eusebia&nbsp; Capiral had failed to repurchase the parcels&nbsp; of land within the period of&nbsp; time stipulated&nbsp; in a contract of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; with a right to repurchase.&nbsp; Laureano Marquez and&nbsp; Eusebia Capiral objected to&nbsp; the&nbsp; application&nbsp; averring&nbsp; that&nbsp; they were&nbsp; the&nbsp; owners of&nbsp; the parcels of land&nbsp; applied for registration , by Vicente Valencia&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; parcels of land&nbsp; were the&nbsp; subject of&nbsp; litigation&nbsp; between&nbsp; them&nbsp; and the applicant then pending&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Bulacan&nbsp; (civil&nbsp; case No. 5250).&nbsp; One&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parcels of land (lot&nbsp; No. 1-b-2)&nbsp; was excluded from the application because it was already registered in the name&nbsp; of Felipia&nbsp; Crisostomo, as evidenced by&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; title No. 12353. By agreement of the parties&nbsp; the hearing of the application for registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; remaining parcel of land (lot No. 1-b-3)&nbsp; was postponed until&nbsp; after final&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; shall have been&nbsp; rendered in&nbsp; civil case&nbsp; No. 5250&nbsp; between the&nbsp; same parties! The&nbsp; spouses Laureano Marquez and&nbsp; Eusebia Capiral, the plaintiffs&nbsp; in civil&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 5250, brought an&nbsp; action&nbsp; against&nbsp; Vicente Valencia to secure&nbsp; a declaration that&nbsp; the deed of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; with<em> pacto de retro</em>&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by them&nbsp; on 27 July 1931 in favor of the defendant was null&nbsp; and&nbsp; void.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bulacan held that&nbsp; the contract was one of antichresis.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; held&nbsp; that it was a sale with&nbsp; <em>pacto&nbsp; de retro</em>.&nbsp; On&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; by certiorari&nbsp; this Court held that it was not a sale with a&nbsp; right to repurchase but an equitable mortgage only and ordered Laureano Marquez&nbsp; and&nbsp; Eusebia Capiral&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; Vicente Valencia the mortgage debt of P7,000. In view&nbsp; of this judgment, on 20 April 1948 Vicente Valencia amended his&nbsp; application alleging that&nbsp; he had acquired&nbsp; the parcel&nbsp; of land&nbsp; (lot No.&nbsp; l-b-3)&nbsp; by&nbsp; inheritance&nbsp; from his&nbsp; maternal grandfather, the late Pedro Crisostomo, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; he and his predecessors-in-interest have been&nbsp; in possession&nbsp; thereof from time immemorial, his possession having been interrupted only on 23 April&nbsp; 1947,&nbsp; by the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of the late Laureano&nbsp; Marquez who&nbsp; also&nbsp; claimed to be&nbsp; the owners of the parcel&nbsp; of land&nbsp; by&nbsp; inheritance&nbsp; from&nbsp; their&nbsp; late parents.&nbsp; After&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; the application for registration filed&nbsp; by the respondent,&nbsp; on the ground of res judicata, and decreed the&nbsp; registration thereof in the name of the estate of&nbsp; the late Laureano Marquez.&nbsp; The dispositive part of the judgment reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Por tanto, de acuerdo con la Seccion&nbsp; 87 de la ley 496, enmendada por&nbsp; la&nbsp; Secci6n 2&nbsp; de la ley&nbsp; 3621,&nbsp; este&nbsp; Tribunal, previo sobreseimiento&nbsp; de&nbsp; la&nbsp; solicitud de Vicente&nbsp; Valencia, decreta, el registro y titulacion del&nbsp; terreno&nbsp; descrito en&nbsp; el piano Psu-10759, Lote No. l-b-3, Exh. F, a nombre del Intestado&nbsp; del difunto Laureano Marquez, con&nbsp; todas las mejoras&nbsp; existentes&nbsp; en la misma.&nbsp; <p>Ordena,&nbsp; ademas,&nbsp; que&nbsp; el&nbsp; Intestado del difunto&nbsp; Laureano&nbsp; Marquez&nbsp; reemtbolse&nbsp; al&nbsp; solicitante de&nbsp; los gastos&nbsp; incurridos&nbsp; por&nbsp; este consistentes en derechos de&nbsp; registro y derechos de publication por haberse presentado&nbsp; de buena&nbsp; fe la presente&nbsp; solicitud de registro por el&nbsp; solicitante.</p>&nbsp; Una&nbsp; ves firme este decision, expidase el decreto correspondiente.</blockquote><p>From&nbsp; this judgment Vicente Valencia appealed.&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated at the beginning of&nbsp; this&nbsp; opinion,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals reversed&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment of the lower court, being of the opinion that the judgment in&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 5250&nbsp; did not bar the filing of&nbsp; an&nbsp; amended&nbsp; application for registration and&nbsp; remanded the case&nbsp; to the lower court for new&nbsp; trial as prayed for by the applicant.</p><p>The rule that&nbsp; a dismissal&nbsp; of an&nbsp; application for&nbsp; the registration&nbsp; of a parcel of land does not bar the filing of another&nbsp; application, cannot be availed of in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case at bar, because a renewal of an application for registration of the same parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land&nbsp; or an&nbsp; amendment&nbsp; thereto upon a ground different&nbsp; from that alleged in the previous application may be allowed if the dismissal of the&nbsp; first application was without prejudice and not when the ownership&nbsp; or title to the parcel&nbsp; of land was litigated by the same parties&nbsp; and&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; rendered for one party and against the other.&nbsp; Under the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of section 37, Act No. 496,&nbsp; if the&nbsp; land registration court&nbsp; "finds that&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp; has not proper title&nbsp; for registration, it shall dismiss the&nbsp; application&nbsp; and&nbsp; the dismissal&nbsp; may be without prejudice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; The provisions&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 37, Act No. 496, has been amended by adding three provisos. The pertinent&nbsp; proviso reads as follows:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; * * * <em>Provided, however,</em> That in case where there is&nbsp; an adverse claim, the court shall determine the&nbsp; conflicting&nbsp; interests&nbsp; of the applicant and the&nbsp; adverse claimant,&nbsp; and&nbsp; after taking&nbsp; evidence shall dismiss the application if neither&nbsp; of them succeeds&nbsp; in showing that he&nbsp; has proper title for registration, or shall enter a decree awarding the&nbsp; land applied for, or any part thereof, to&nbsp; the person entitled&nbsp; thereto,&nbsp; and such&nbsp; decree,&nbsp; when final, shall entitle to the issuance of&nbsp; an original certificate of&nbsp; title to&nbsp; such person: * *&nbsp; *. (Section 2,&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 3621.)</blockquote><p>So that if by&nbsp; virtue of or pursuant to&nbsp; a final judgment the land registration court should decree the registration of a&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land applied for&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name of the opponent, the&nbsp; applicant&nbsp; could not&nbsp; apply anew for the registration&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; parcel of&nbsp; land which had already been&nbsp; decreed registered in the name of his opponent.&nbsp; In this case the&nbsp; parties agreed to have&nbsp; the action brought by Laureano Marquez and Eusebia Capiral against Vicente Valencia to secure a&nbsp; declaration that the&nbsp; deed of&nbsp; sale of the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land with a right to&nbsp; repurchase,&nbsp; upon which Vicente Valencia based his application&nbsp; for&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parcel of land, was&nbsp; a nullity,&nbsp; (civil&nbsp; case No. 5250) heard and&nbsp; decided before&nbsp; the application&nbsp; for registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Court of First Instance of Bulacan and on appeal the Court of Appeals had&nbsp; rendered their&nbsp; respective judgments as&nbsp; above&nbsp; adverted&nbsp; to,&nbsp; this Court on appeal by certiorari held that the deed of&nbsp; sale with a&nbsp; right to repurchase&nbsp; was only an equitable mortgage.&nbsp; In view of this judgment Vicente Valencia amended his application claiming&nbsp; that he had&nbsp; inherited the&nbsp; parcel of land from&nbsp; his&nbsp; late&nbsp; maternal grandfather Pedro Crisostomo.&nbsp; After hearing, the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Bulacan, acting as land registration court, found&nbsp; that the judgment in the civil case&nbsp; (No. 5250)&nbsp; between the same parties&nbsp; above referred to constitutes&nbsp; <em>res judicata</em> and&nbsp; bars the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of the&nbsp; applicant&nbsp; to&nbsp; have the&nbsp; land registered in his name.&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal the Court of Appeals held otherwise, and as already stated&nbsp; remanded the&nbsp; case to the lower court for new trial.</p><p>The action for nullity or annulment of the deed of sale of a&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; with a right&nbsp; reserved&nbsp; by the&nbsp; vendors to repurchase it brought&nbsp; in civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 5250 of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan by the&nbsp; spouses Laureano Marquez and Eusebia Capiral against&nbsp; Vicente Valencia&nbsp; was really&nbsp; for reformation of the&nbsp; contract or deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale.&nbsp; The action&nbsp; referred to involved ownership or title&nbsp; to the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land purportedly&nbsp; sold&nbsp; by the plaintiffs&nbsp; to the&nbsp; defendant with a&nbsp; right reserved&nbsp; by the&nbsp; former&nbsp; to repurchase&nbsp; it&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter,&nbsp; because whether the contract was of antichresis, of&nbsp; sale or of mortgage, the only inference that&nbsp; could be&nbsp; drawn from it was&nbsp; that the plaintiffs were the owners of the parcel of land.&nbsp; By resisting the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; ground that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; title to the parcel of land&nbsp; by a deed of sale&nbsp; with a right to repurchase&nbsp; and for&nbsp; failure of the plaintiffs to&nbsp; repurchase it&nbsp; within the period of time stipulated in the deed,&nbsp; the defendant expressly admitted that he had derived title to the parcel of land from the&nbsp; plaintiffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, aside&nbsp; from relying solely on the&nbsp; deed of sale with a&nbsp; right to repurchase and&nbsp; failure&nbsp; on the part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; vendors&nbsp; to purchase&nbsp; it&nbsp; within the period&nbsp; stipulated therein, the&nbsp; defendant had&nbsp; set&nbsp; up an alternative though inconsistent defense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that he had inherited the&nbsp; parcel of&nbsp; land from&nbsp; his&nbsp; late&nbsp; maternal grandfather and&nbsp; presented&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; in support of&nbsp; both defenses, the overruling of the first would not bar the determination by the court of the second.&nbsp; The defendant having failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; set up&nbsp; such alternative defenses&nbsp; and chosen or&nbsp; elected to rely on&nbsp; one only,&nbsp; the&nbsp; overruling thereof was a&nbsp; complete determination of the controversy between the parties which bars a subsequent action based upon an unpleaded defense, or any other cause of action, except that of failure&nbsp; of the complaint to state a cause of action and of lack of jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The determination of the issue joined by&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties constitutes <em>res judicata</em>.&nbsp; More, the finding of the trial court and&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; that&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; took a lease on the parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to be registered by him&nbsp; from the spouses&nbsp; Laureano&nbsp; Marquez and&nbsp; Eusebia Capiral,&nbsp; the predecessors-in-interest of the petitioners, is another&nbsp; proof that Vicente Valencia was&nbsp; not the owner thereof.&nbsp; A lease contract lawfully entered into precludes the lessee from questioning the title of the&nbsp; lessor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed&nbsp; and that&nbsp; of the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the respondent.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
