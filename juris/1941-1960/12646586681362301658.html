				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These two appeals, involving a small parcel of land, are here for  consideration because they involve only questions of law arising from the order of the Capiz court of first instance,  (December  12, 1955)  dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint and the intervenor's  claim, on the  ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata. </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;">The  complaint  and/or the  amended complaint alleged these facts: <br><br>The spouses Juan Aguirre and Pascuala Amayat owned Lot 412  of  the Cadastral  Survey of Capiz,  Capiz. The former died, and was survived by his wife and their three children named Raymundo, Atanasia and Ricardo.<br><br>In July 1924, the. land was registered under the Torrens System and Original Certificate of Title No.  3269 was issued pro-indiviso in the name of Raymundo Aguirre married to Abadesa Bernas, Atanasia Aguirre, wife of Tomas Atienza and Ricardo Aguirre married to Carmen Lim. <br><br>In 1922  Atanasia Aguirre  died  intestate, leaving no descendants of her own.  She was survived by her mother, Pascuala Amayat who passed away, intestate also,  in 1923. <br><br>In March 1931, Ricardo Aguirre  conveyed all  his interest in the lot  to Tomas Atienza, his brother-in-law. In February 1942, Tomas Atienza,  died  intestate and in his  intestate proceedings   (Civil Case  No. V-171)  his acknowledged natural child, Manuel  Atienza, was declared the  sole  surviving heir.   The deed of sale  of  Ricardo Aguirre to Tomas Atienza together  with the declaration of heirship were duly annotated on the back of the Original Certificate of Title No. 3269. <br><br>In  1935, all the  rights of Raymundo Aguirre  to the lot in question were sold at public  auction to  Bachrach Motor Co., Inc.,  which in turn conveyed its  rights in  1936 to Abadesa Bernas (Raymundo's widow).  Abadesa died subsequently,  leaving as  heirs  her  six children,  Loreta, Consolacion, Juan, Vicente, Jose and Lourdes; but in 1949 Loreta (with her husband  Filemon Lopez—present plaintiffs) purchased all the rights of Juan, Vicente, Jose and Lourdes  (excluding  that of  Consolacion).                <br><br>In October  1949, herein defendant Manuel  B. Atienza, instituted Civil Case No. V-518  for partition of the same Lot 412,  claiming  one-half  undivided share  thereof,  as  the  only  successor of Tomas Atienza, who had purchased Ricardo Aguirre's share in 1931. Defendants in the action  were the herein  plaintiffs  and also herein   defendants  Maria  Pelayo Atienza and  Emeliana Atienza, including Consolacion  Aguirre  herein  plaintiff-at-first-later-defendant.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>   (Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. was  also   defendant;   but it may  be left  out of the picture.) <br><br>Such  Civil  Case  No.  V—518  ended  with  a  judgment entered in accordance with the parties' stipulation asking   for  adjudication, partly  as follows:                             <br><blockquote>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) that the share of Ricardo Aguirre consisting of 1/3 of Lot No. 412 be adjudicated  to plaintiff Manuel B. Atienza.  It is agreed  that this share of Manuel B. Atienza shall be in the middle portion  of said lot. <br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that the share of Atanacia Aguirre consisting of 1/3 of the same lot be adjudicated  to  defendants Maria  Pelayo  Atienza and  Emeliana Atienza.  It is agreed that  this share shall  be the southern portion of said  lot.                                            <br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) that the share of Raymundo Aguirre, now deceased consisting of 1/3 of said  lot be adjudicated in  the following  manner: 1/6 is adjudicated to defendant Consolacion Aguirre and  5/6 to Loreta Aguirre.  It is agreed that the share of Consolacion Aguirre shall immediately follow and adjacent to the  portion awarded to Maria  Pelayo Atienza  and  her  daughter, while that of  Loreta Aguirre shall be the northern portion  of the lot."</blockquote> Such judgment dated September 29, 1950 is now final and unappealable.                                               <br><br>The plaintiffs in this case, filed  in 1952, further alleged—and this is the core of the matter—that the share  allotted  to Maria Pelayo Atienza and Emeliana  Atienza  in said  Civil Case No.  V-518 <span style="font-style: italic;">had no legal  foundation</span>,  because the latter were allowed to participate as wife and daughter of Pedro Atienza who had no right  to any part of said Lot. <br><br>On the basis of the above allegations, plaintiffs assert that they,  (together with Consolacion, who refused to side with them, and therefore, was subsequently made defendant) were entitled to <span style="font-style: italic;">one half </span>instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">one third</span> of Lot 412, upon  cancellation of the Atienza's  share, which they, the plaintiffs, request. <br><br>Defendant Manuel B. Atienza, was substituted by his successor-in-interest Jose A. Atienza.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> <br><br>The latter filed a  complaint in intervention, seconding the  plaintiffs'  request for  cancellation of the share adjudicated to  Maria   Pelayo  Atienza  and  her  daughter Emeliana, explaining further that the latter got a portion of the Lot in Civil Case  No. V-518 "under the erroneous impression that Pedro Atienza (their husband and father) was  the  adopted son  and  forced heir of Atanacia Aguirre, when in fact he was just her protegee." <br><br>Upon  a  motion submitted by defendants Maria  Pelayo Atienza  and Emeliana Atienza, which  was duly opposed by the plaintiffs and the intervenor,  the court issued its order of dismissal which is here on appeal.  In  the opinion of the Judge, the parties herein were  bound  by the adjudication  in Civil Case No. V-518 in September 1950. <br><br>These  appeals call  for application  of the principles of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.  According  to the Rules  (Sec.  44 Rule 39) the judgment in Civil Case No. V-518 is "in  the matter directly adjudged, conclusive between the parties and their successors  in interest by title subsequent to  commencement of the action or special proceeding,  litigating  for the same thing  and under the same title and in the same capacity."<br><br>In order  that a judgment rendered in. a case may be conclusive  in a subsequent litigation, the following circumstances must be shown;  (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)  Such judgment must be final;  (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) The court rendering it had jurisdiction  of the parties and the subject matter;  (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) The  judgment was issued on the merits; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) Identity between the two cases,  as to parties, subject-matter, and cause  of action.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup> <br><br>None of the parties doubt the presence of the first three circumstances.  As to the fourth,  it is  obvious  that the two litigations involve the same subject matter (Lot 412) and same cause of action  (ownership of parts of the lot through  corresponding  predecessors in   interest).  The parties are the same, although partly in reversed or modified roles;  plaintiff in the first  is  now  defendant  (later intervenor);  some defendants in  the first are now plaintiffs.  However, this  is  not material.  The contention of all parties in both cases, have the same basis; ownership. We once held, it is true, that the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata </span>does not  operate between persons  who, having been co-parties (defendants or  plaintiffs)  in the first case, are opposing  parties  in the second case.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</span></sup>  (Plaintiffs herein together with Maria Pelayo Atienza and Emeliana Atienza were co-defendants  in  Civil  Case  No. V-518, and now they are  contending parties).  But such holding applied the general rule, which admits of some exceptions.  Where the individual claims of such co-parties in the first case were brot in issue, litigated and determined<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</span></sup>—as in case V-518 where the share of  each claimant  was  actually decided—res  judicata applies to  such co-parties.<br><blockquote>"The  rule, however, is not  without  exception,  as  where  all the questions that can be litigated in  the subsequent action must have been established in  the prior  action. * * *." <br><br>"Judgment or decree in partition suit.—While a dismissal of a suit for partition is not binding on defendants as an  adjudication of their rights between or among themselves, <span style="font-style: italic;">where  partition  is granted, the  decree is binding  on  all parties whether complainants or defendants, as each is an adversary party</span> in the sense that he is bound to make known his rights and have his interests determined by the decree.  *  * *." (50 Corpus Juris  Secundum p. 375.)</blockquote> If it be argued that whereas in the  previous case, partition was  prayed for, in the present case,  rescission is the remedy, the answer is:<br><blockquote>"Notwithstanding a difference in the form to  two actions, the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> will he applied where it appears  that the parties in  the  two suits were in effect "litigating  for the  same thing. <br><br>A party  cannot, by varying the  form of action,  or  adopting a different method of presenting his ease, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not  be  twice litigated between the same parties or their  privies."   (Peñalosa <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Tuason, 22 Phil. 303; Paz <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Inandan, 75 Phil. 608.)</blockquote>Nonetheless, appellants submit that theirs  is  an action to  rescind the partition,  filed within four  years  after September 1950 (Art 1100 New Civil  Code);  action which is specially authorized by Art. 1098 of the same Code: <br><blockquote>"ART. 1098. A  partition, judicial  or extra-judicial, may also be rescinded on account of lesion, when any  one of the co-heirs  received things whose value  is less, by at least one-fourth,  than the share  to which he is entitled,  considering the value of the things at the time they were adjudicated."</blockquote>The  point  has no merit.  The judicial  partition mentioned  in  the  above article is  a  partition  effected among "co-heirs."  Yet the partition  in  Civil Case No.  V-518 was not  among co-heirs.  Plaintiffs-appellants took  part therein as heirs of Abadesa Bernas  who <span style="font-style: italic;">had purchased</span> Raymundo Aguirre's share from Bachrach Motor Co., who had  in turn   acquired it  at  an  auction sale.  Herein defendants were not co-heirs  of  said plaintiffs,  neither of the  estate of Abadesa nor of the  estate of Raymundo Aguirre,  nor of the estate  of Juan Aguirre. <br><br>The same consideration applies to defendant-appellee Manuel Atienza, whose father and  predecessor-in-interest Tomas Atienza <span style="font-style: italic;">had  bought</span> the share  of Ricardo Aguirre.<br><br>Tomas was not heir of Juan Aguirre and was not co-heir of the others.                                              <br><br>The  lot was  registered in the name of three Aguirre  co-owners; Raymundo, Anastasia, Ricardo.  The partition in V-518 was in reality <span style="font-style: italic;">among co-owners</span> or their successors-in-interest.                                       <br><br>We must, therefore, hold that,  as between the herein  plaintiffs and defendants, the adjudication  in Civil Case   No. V-518 is conclusive and final.<br><br>However,  as  to the intervenor Jose  Atienza<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</span></sup> we note that  he purchased  the interests of  Manuel  Atienza on   August 9, 1948, i.  e., a full year  <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span>  the institution  by the latter of  Civil Case No. V-518.  Hence,  by the very terms  of Rule 39,  sec. 44,  he  (Jose Atienza)  is not  bound by the judgment in such Civil Case, since  he was not a party,  nor took  part in it, and he is not "successor in interest by title subsequent to commencement of the action."                                                <br><br>Wherefore, the  appealed judgment is  affirmed in so far as  it dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint.   It  is reversed as to the intervenor Jose Atienza; and the record will be  remanded to the court below for further proceedings in connection with his claim in intervention, Cots against plaintiffs-appellants.                                       <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
