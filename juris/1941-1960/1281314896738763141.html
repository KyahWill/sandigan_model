				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of
 Manila which orders the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of 
P2,701.22, with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of 
the complaint, and the costs.
  <p>    The facts of this case, which are not disputed, are correctly 
stated in the brief for appellant as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The plaintiff-appellee, N. V. Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., H. Mij., is
 a foreign corporation duly organized and registered under the laws of 
Java, and duly authorized to do business in the Philippines, with office
 in the City of Manila; the defendant-appellant, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
 Banking Corporation, is a banking corporation duly organized and 
registered under the laws of the British Colony of Hongkong, and duly 
authorized to do business in the Philippines, and with the office in the
 City of Manila; and 'N.V. Arnold &amp; Otto Meyer' is a foreign 
corporation duly organized and registered under the laws of Holland, 
with its principal office and place of business at Amsterdam, Holland.</p>
    <p>"By reason of various exchange transactions between 
plaintiff-appellee and defendant-appellant, prior to the immediate facts
 which gave rise to the present controversy between plaintiff-appellee 
and defendant-appellant, and which had no relation thereto, other than 
with reference to the balance of the account resulting therefrom, there 
was due, as of September 27, 1939, from defendant-appellant to 
plaintiff-appellee, the sum of P5,581.80.</p>
    <p>"The plaintiff-appellee, for sometime prior to December 31, 1939,
 had maintained a current account deposit with the defendant-appellant 
Bank, and on December 31, 1939, the plaintiff-appellee justly owed to 
the defendant-appellant, by way of overdraft in said current account, 
the sum of P2,880.58, Philippine Currency.</p>
    <p>"Offsetting the amount of P5,581.80 due from defendant-apellant 
to plaintiff-appellee with the amount of P2,880.58, owing by 
plaintiff-appellee to defendant-appellant by way of overdraft in 
plaintiff-appellee's current account with the defendant-appellant 
mentioned in the next preceding paragraph hereof, there was left a 
balance justly due and owing from defendant-appellant to 
plaintiff-appellee under the aforementioned exchange contracts, as of 
December 31, 1939, in the sum of P2,701.22, unless lawfully compensated 
or offset by some subsequent transactions.</p>
    <p>"Plaintiff-appellee, prior to the bringing of this action, made 
demand upon the defendant-appellant for the payment of said sum of 
P2,701.22 referred to in the last preceding paragraph, but 
defendant-appellant refused to pay the same by reason of a non-accepted 
draft plaintiff-appellee had negotiated with it, as hereinafter more 
particularly set forth, and, as a result of such offsetting 
indebtedness, it alleged that she said sum of P2,701.22 had been 
compensated leaving a balance owing by the plaintiff-appellee to 
defendant-appellant in the amount of P4,150.21, for which a statement 
was submitted to plaintiff-appellee by defendant-appellant accompanied 
by a demand for payment of said balance, which plaintiff-appellee 
refused to pay.</p>
    <p>"The plaintiff-appellee is, and was during all the time mentioned
 in the complaint, the duly authorized agent and representative in the 
Philippines of N. V. Arnold Otto Meyer.  There was organized in the year
 1938 a corporation by the name of 'German Steamship Agencies (P. I.) 
(formerly Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., and Zuellig &amp; Von Knobelsdorff) 
Inc.,' a corporation organized and registered under the laws of the 
Philippines, with its principal office in the City of Manila.  During 
all the time mentioned in the complaint said corporation was and is the 
representative in the Philippine of the Hamburg-Amerikanishce 
Packetfarht Actien Gasellschafft, sometimes known as Humburg-Amerika 
Linie, the owner of the S.S. 'Naumburg,' a vessel of German registry, 
hereinafter mentioned.  F. Danielsen, who is the Manager of the 
plaintiff-appellee company, was also one of the incorporators, and 
during all of said time was the managing director of said 'German 
Steamship Agencies (P. I.) (formerly Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., and Zuellig 
&amp; Von Knobelsdorff) Inc.'  The plaintiff-appellee and the latter 
companies are managed by the same officials and office staff and have 
the same office at 506 Insular Life Building, Binondo, Manila, and 
should be considered as one.  (See People <i>v.</i> Padilla, G. R. No. 
47027, promulgated February 4, 1941.)</p>
    <p>"On or about August 16, 1939, the plaintiff-appellee shipped on 
the S.S. 'Naumburg' 200 tons of Philippine Hydraulic Pressed Copra Cake 
consigned to Arnold Otto Meyer, of Hamburg, Germany, and for which 
shipment the corresponding bills of lading, in triplicate, were issued.</p>
    <p>"For said shipment of 200 tons of copra cake the 
plaintiff-appellee on August 16, 1939, drew a bill of exchange at 60 
days' sight, documents to be delivered against acceptance, on N. V. 
Arnold Otto Meyer, of Amsterdam, in favor of the defendant-appellant, 
the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, for the sum of L805 
(pounds sterling) equivalent to P7,501.48, Philippine Currency, payable 
in London, England, a copy of said bill of exchange being attached to 
the Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'A' (the first of exchange) and 
'A-1' (the second of exchange), and on the 16th day of August, 1939, the
 plaintiff-appellee negotiated said bill of exchange at the 
defendant-appellant bank for the sum of P7,499.96, and at that time 
credit was duly given to the plaintiff-appellee by said bank for the 
said sum of P7,499.96, in its current account with the 
defendant-appellant.  A copy of the credit slip for said amount is 
attached to the Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'B'.</p>
    <p>"On August 17, 1939, the S.S. 'Naumburg', with said 200 tons of 
copra cake on board, left Manila for Hamburg, Germany, and other 
European ports, via Cebu and Java ports, but did not complete the 
voyage, instead it entered into and took refuge at the Port of 
Sourabaya, Netherlands East Indies, at the outburst of the war between 
Germany and England on or about September 3, 1939, and the boat was 
still lying in that port at least until the month of May, 1940, a matter
 over which the defendant-appellant had no control.</p>
    <p>"The first available mail transportation from Manila to New York,
 after August 16, 1939, by which said drafts and shipping documents 
could have been forwarded to New York, was the German steamship 
'Scharnhorst', another vessel of the Hamburg-Amerikanishche Packetfarht 
Actien Gasellscharfft, or Hamburg-Amerika Linie, of which the 'German 
Steamship Agencies (P.I.) (formerly Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., and Zuellig 
&amp; Von Knobelsdorff) Inc.,' was also the agent and representative in 
the Philippines, but due to unsettled conditions, the world then being 
on the eve of a general war, as the Court will judicially recognize, no 
mail whatsoever was sent by the defendant-appellant by said steamer.  
While the said steamer left the Port of Manila on or about August 25, 
1939, it was not able to complete its contemplated voyage, as the 
defendant-appellant had auticipated, and, for reasons beyond the control
 of the defendant-appellant, took refuge at the Port of Kobe, Japan, at 
the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Great Britain which 
occurred a few days after said steamer had left Manila, and has remained
 at Kobe, Japan, a refugee ship, up to the present time.</p>
    <p>"On August 28, 1939, the defendant-appellant mailed the first of 
exchange of the bill (Annex 'A' of the Stipulation of Facts) and the 
original and the duplicate of the bills of lading, the invoices and 
insurance policies covering the shipment of the said 200 tons of copra 
cake, to its London office via its New York Office, on the S.S. 'Empress
 of Japan', the next available mail transportation, which left Manila on
 that date for Vancourver, Canada.  The S.S. 'Empress of Japan' was for a
 certain time detained at Shanghai, China, due to unsettled conditions 
over which the defendant-appellant had no control, but resumed its 
voyage later on.  In the meantime the mail for New York was transferred 
to an American vessel, and went forward in due course to its 
destination.  (See letter of the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking 
Corporation to its branch office in New York City dated September 7, 
1939, attached to the Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'C', and a copy
 of Form No. 117, used by the defendant-appellant, attached to the 
Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'C-1'.)</p>
    <p>"On September 1, 1939, the defendant-appellant mailed the second 
of exchange of the bill (Annex 'A-1' of the Stipulation of Facts), and 
the third copy of the bill of lading covering the shipment of 200 tons 
of copra cake, on the next available mail transportation from Manila, 
the S.S. 'Saparoea,' addressed to defendant's-appellant's office at 
London, through its New York office, and this boat reached the West 
Coast ports of the United States in due course.</p>
    <p>"On September 15, 1939, the 'German Steamship Agencies (P.I.) 
(formerly Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., and Zuellig &amp; Von Knobelsdorff) 
Inc.,' representing the Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actien 
Gasellschafft, also known as the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, and other German
 steamship lines, caused to be issued a circular (a copy of which is 
attached to the Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'D') to the effect 
that 'the cargo loaded from Manila to Europe, to the U.S.A. and way 
ports on board Hamburg-Amerika Linie vessels at present lying at ports 
of refuge may now be delivered provided storage of the cargo should 
permit such procedure; that 'full sets of original bills of lading must 
be surrendered' and that 'should delivery be taken after October 10, 
1939, owners reserve their rights to collect from consignees, shippers 
and/or owners of the goods a deposit to cover the expenses incurred by 
the vessel calling at a port of refuge.'  The defendant-appellant was 
served on or about the same date by the 'German Steamship Agencies 
(P.I.) formerly Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., and Zuellig &amp; Von 
Knobelsdorff) Inc.' with a copy of said circular.</p>
    <p>"On September 21, 1939, and before the original or duplicate of 
said draft (Annexes 'A' and 'A-1' of the Stipulation of Facts) with the 
attached shipping documents, had left the office of the 
defendant-appellant bank in New York City, the defendant-appellant bank,
 by reason of the receipt by it of the aforementioned circular of 
September 15, 1939, cables its New York office to deliver the bills of 
lading covering said copra cake attached to said draft, to the 
Hamburg-Amerika Linie, the New York agents of the S.S. 'Naumburg,' of 
which the 'German Steamship Agencies (P.I.) (formerly Behn, Meyer &amp; 
Co., and Zuellig &amp; Von Knobelsdorff) Inc.' was the agent and 
representative in the Philippines, as shown by its cable of that date to
 its said agents, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      'Our draft 2861 to London original per 'Empress of Japan'
 duplicate per 'Saparceal' please hand bills of lading to 
Hamburg-Amerika Linie New York Agents against receipt instructing them 
to advise their Manila Office by wire.'  (Stipulation of Facts, p. 8.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and or about September 26, 1939, likewise in accordance with the 
instructions from the defendant-appellant bank, the New York office of 
said bank detached from said draft and surrendered the original bills of
 lading covering said 200 tons of copra cake shipped on the S.S. 
'Naumburg' to the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, the agents of said vessel in 
New York City, as shown by the following cable of that date: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>''Naumburg' — Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation 
surrendered to us original bills of lading Manila/Marseilles B/L 1 
Manila/Hamburg B/L 1 Cebu/Hamburg BLs No. . . . to . . . 4-9 total 800 
tons of 2240 lbs. copra and 200 tons of 2240 lbs. copra cake.'  
(Stipulation of Facts, p. 8.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"On September 21, 1939, the defendant-appellant bank wrote its 
London office (a copy of which letter is attached to the Stipulation of 
Facts, marked Annex 'E') advising it of the sending of the wire next 
above quoted and instruction it to 'point out to the drawee that we are 
taking action in their interests, and obtain their confirmation.'</p>
    <p>"On September 23, 1939, the defendant-appellant wrote to the 
plaintiff-appellee (a copy of which letter is attached to the 
Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'F') requesting instructions as to 
the disposal of the cargo covered by the draft inasmuch as the steamship
 'Naumburg' was still lying in the Port of Sourabaya, and to which 
letter plaintiff-appellee replied and delivered to defendant-appellant 
the letter dated September 27, 1939 (a copy of which is attached to the 
Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'G') wherein plaintiff-appellee 
stated that 'according to cable advice received from the drawee the 
above draft has not yet been presented for acceptance.'</p>
    <p>"The original of said bill exchange, without the accompanying 
bills of lading and other shipping documents for said 200 tons of copra 
cake, but with a declaration regarding the delivery to the Steamship 
Company of the bills of lading in New York, was forwarded to Londo, and 
on or about October 26, 1939, the said bill of exchange, with the 
accompanying declaration as to the surrender of the bills of lading in 
its behalf to the Steamship Company in New York, was presented to the 
said N. V. Arnold Otto Meyer, 256 Heerengcracht, Amsterdam, the drawee, 
for acceptance, but the said N. V. Arnold Otto Meyer refused to accept 
said draft on the pretext that the bills of lading and other shipping 
documents originally attached to said draft and covering the cargo 
against which the said bill had been drawn were not attached thereto nor
 delivery thereof made or offered to the said N. V. Arnold Otto Meyer, 
as shown by the following cablegram received by the defendant-appellant 
from its London office on October 31, 1939:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>    'Your Draft 2861 refused acceptance Meyer no Bills of 
Lading late shipment high refuge charges.'  (Stipulation of Facts, p. 
10.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"On November 7, 1939, the plaintiff-appellee wrote the 
defendant-appellant, a copy of which letter is attached to the 
Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'H', saying in part:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>    'We shall consider refund to you of the value of the draft 
only after you return to us the draft with the relative documents 
attached thereto.'</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"On November 8 and 9, 1939, the defendant-appellant bank, in 
accordance with the letter of the plaintiff-appellee dated November 7, 
1939, above mentioned (Annex 'H' of the Stipulation of Facts), cabled 
its New York and London offices to obtain possession of the full set of 
the bills of lading and other shipping documents covering the said 
shipping of 200 tons of copra cake which it had originally delivered to 
the Steamship Company in New York pursuant to the circular of advice 
received from the 'German Steamship Agencies (P. I.) (formerly Behn, 
Meyer &amp; Co., and Zuellig &amp; Von Knobeldsdorff) Inc.,' as set out 
on pages 9 and 10 of this brief, and return same to  said bank in Manila
 by air mail, as shown by the following cablegrams of November 8 and 9, 
1939:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>    'Re our wire of 21st September if possible obtain 
repossession of full set of Bills of Lading our Draft 2861 to London and
 send them here by air mail.  Wire when sent.'</p>
      <p>    'Re your wire of 31st Meyer return all documents hereby air
 mail.'  (Stipulation of Facts, p. 11.)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"On November 11, 1939, the defendant-appellant wrote the German 
Steamship Agencies (P.I.) Inc. a letter (a copy of which is attached to 
the Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'J') asking said company to cable
 the Hamburg-Amerika Linie, New York instructing them to return the 
bills of lading to defendant's appellant's New York office.</p>
    <p>"Said bills of lading and other shipping documents were returned 
by Clipper mail to the defendant-appellant bank and were received by it 
on or about December 11, 1939, and on the same date, December 11, 1939, 
the defendant-appellant sent to plaintiff-appellee a letter (a copy of 
which is attached to the Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'K') wherein
 the defendant-appellant informed the plaintiff-appellee that it had 
received the drafts already and full sets of documents and that the same
 would be handed over upon payment of the amount of the draft together 
with expenses and interest, and to which letter, the plaintiff-appellee 
replied on December 12, 1939 (copy of which is attached to the 
Stipulation of Facts, marked Annex 'L'), wherein the plaintiff-appellee 
called the attention of the defendant-appellant to its letter of 
November 9, 1939, and saying that, as they had not received any 
instructions, they recommended the presentation of the draft to the 
drawee, as requested by the buyers; and on or about December 14, 1939, 
said bills of lading and other shipping documents were sent by the 
defendant-appellant bank to its agent in Sourabaya for the purpose of 
arranging for the disposal of said 200 tons of copra cake.</p>
    <p>"On or about March 6, 1940, the second of exchange of said bill 
of exchange (Annex 'A-1' of the Stipulation of Facts) was returned by 
defendant-appellant bank to Hope &amp; Co., of Amsterdam, as its agents 
at said place, and said bill of exchange was again presented for 
acceptance to the N. V. Arnold Otto Meyer, the drawee of said draft, 
which wrote on the bank thereof and signed its name underneath said 
notation, as shown by Annex 'A-1' of the Stipulation of Facts, as of 
November 6, 1939, the following:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>      'We refuse acceptance, because: the shipping documents 
covering the cargo against which this bill of exchange has been drawn, 
are not attached to the bill of exchange.</p>

    <p>which under applicable Netherlands law is a proper acknowledgment
 of presentation by reason of the protest in simplified form (a form 
specifically recognized by said law)."</p>
  </blockquote>  
  <p>The central issue to be determined in this appeal, as posed by the 
parties, is: Should the Court find that defendant did not properly 
present the bill of exchange for acceptance, and was not legally excused
 therefrom, said defendant would have no recourse against the drawer, 
plaintiff herein; on the other hand, should the Court find that the 
defendant had properly presented said bill of exchange, or is otherwise 
excused therefrom, then defendant has recourse against plaintiff and is 
entitled to a judgment in its favor for the balance due.</p>
  <p>    The facts which in our opinion are necessary to consider in the
 determination of this issue are: On August 28, 1939, 
defendant-appellant mailed the first of exchange of the bill, with the 
original and duplicate of the bills of lading and the insurance policies
 covering the shipment, to its agent in New York.  On September 1, 1939,
 defendant-appellant mailed the second of exchange of the bill, and the 
third copy of the bill of lading covering the same shipment, also to its
 agent in New York.  All these documents reached their destination on or
 before September 21, 1939.  On September 15, 1939, the German Steamship
 Agencies (P.I.) Inc., representative in the Philippines of the owner of
 the S. S. "Naumburg", issued a circular stating in substance that the 
cargo from Manila to Europe and the United States on board said ship at 
present lying at ports of refuge may be delivered provided the bills of 
lading are surrendered and should delivery be taken after October 10, 
1939, the owner of the ship reserves the right to collect from 
consignees, shippers or owners of the cargo certain refuge charges.  
Defendant-appellant was served copy of this circular on the same date.  
In view of this circular, defendant-appellant instructed its New York 
office to deliver the bills of lading covering the shipment to the New 
York agent of the S. S. "Naumburg", which instruction was carried out on
 September 26, 1939.  The first of exchange of the bill, without the 
bills of lading and other shipping documents, but with a declaration 
regarding the delivery of the bills of lading to the agent of the ship 
in New York City, was on October 26, 1939, presented to the drawee, N. 
V. Arnold Otto Meyer, for acceptance, but the latter refused to accept 
said draft on the ground that the bills of lading and other shipping 
documents were not attached thereto.</p>
  <p>    It is clear from these facts that there was an unreasonable 
delay in the delivery of the bill of exchange to the drawee for 
acceptance.  It appears that the first and second of exchange of the 
bill, as well as the bills of lading and other shipping documents, 
reached the New York office of defendant-appellant as early as September
 21, 1939, but they were not delivered to the drawee, or at least the 
bill of exchange until October 26, 1939.  The reason advanced for such 
failure is the circular issued by the owner of the ship relative to the 
delivery of the cargo and the payment of the refuge charges if not 
removed on October 10, 1939.  But such circular cannot offer any excuse 
for the non-delivery of the pertinent documents to the drawee because 
the circular was merely intended to save the cargo from the refuge 
charges by giving the necessary advice to the owners of the cargo.  This
 matter was not the concern of defendant-appellant, which was merely a 
holder of the draft, but of the drawee, and enough time there was for 
defendant-appellant to advice the drawee of the contents of the 
circular.  Defendant-appellant had also enough time to deliver the bill 
of exchange, with the bills of lading and other shipping documents 
attached, to the drawee for the deadline fixed in the circular was 
October 10, 1939.  It should be noted that, notwithstanding the 
declaration of war between England and Germany, the airmail and steamer 
services between New York, London and Amsterdam, were then in operation.
  Had the documents been delivered in due course, the drawee could have 
no excuse for refusing acceptance, and could have taken the steps he may
 deem proper regarding the disposition of the cargo as contemplated in 
the circular.  Defendant-appellant has assumed the task of taking action
 on the cargo as called for in the circular and must consequently assume
 the corresponding risk and responsibility.</p>
  <p>    Defendant-appellant claims that it should not be blamed for not
 delivering on time the bills of lading to the drawee because it merely 
complied with the instructions contained in the circular.  And it claims
 that, for having appellant complied with said instructions, 
plaintiff-appellee cannot disclaim responsibility under the draft 
because there are circumstances which seem to indicate that the same was
 issued with the knowledge and approval of said appellee.  Thus, it is 
claimed, plaintiff-appellee, drawer of the draft in question, is the 
agent of the drawee in the Philippines.  The S.S. "Naumburge" is owned 
by a corporation of which the representative in the Philippines is the 
German Steamship Agencies (P.I.) Inc.  The latter company is a 
subsidiary corporation of plaintiff-appellee as evidenced by the fact 
that its corporate name bears the description "formerly Behn, Meyer 
&amp; Co.", and plaintiff is one of its incorporators and managing 
director.  And plaintiff-appellee and said companies are managed by the 
same officials.  In other words, the implication is drawn that while the
 circular adverted to was issued by the owner of the ship, or its 
representative, it must have been issued with full knowledge of, and in 
collusion with, plaintiff-appellee considering their close juridical 
relation.</p>
  <p>    We do not subscribe to this sweeping implication.  While there 
may be business relations between the drawer, the drawee and the 
shipping company, there is no evidence whatsoever of any collusion or 
community of action on their part to cause prejudice to 
defendant-appellant in this particular transaction.  The contrary is 
true.  Thus, it appears that the German Steamship Agencies (P.I.) Inc., 
is a domestic corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines.  
The appellee in turn is a corporation organized under the law of Java, 
whereas the steamer "Naumburg" is owned by a German corporation known as
 Humburg-Amerika Linie.  The circular was issued by the German Steamship
 Agencies (P.I.) Inc., whose head office was at Shanghai, merely in 
compliance with the instruction received from the latter.  And the 
circular was issued not only in contemplation of the cargo in question 
but with reference to all the shipments that were then loaded on board 
the ship.  These circumstances, in the absence of any clear showing to 
the contrary, reject any idea of collusion or bad faith on the part of 
the drawer, drawee and the shipping company.</p>
  <p>    Another question that should not be overlooked is the failure 
of defendant-appellant to make the protest required by law when the 
draft or bill of exchange was refused acceptance by the drawee.  Our law
 requires that when a draft is dishonored by non-acceptance, it should 
be protested, and if it is not so protested, the drawer and indorsers
