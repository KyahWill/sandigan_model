				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1953, respondent was issued by the&nbsp; Import Control Commission License No.&nbsp; 16679 giving&nbsp; him authority to import&nbsp; goods under&nbsp; "no&nbsp; dollar remittance basis."&nbsp; On the strength of said license, he effected the importation of&nbsp; old&nbsp; newspapers&nbsp; in&nbsp; four shipments:&nbsp; the first in July,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the second in September,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the third in&nbsp; May,&nbsp; 1954 and the fourth&nbsp; in November, 1954. The Last&nbsp; shipment arrived in Manila on November 7, 1954 and the&nbsp; same was&nbsp; seized by the customs authorities on the ground that the importation was&nbsp; made&nbsp; without&nbsp; the license required by&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Circular No. 45.&nbsp; While&nbsp; the seizure case was pending before the Collector of&nbsp; Customs, the President&nbsp; of the Philippines, acting through his&nbsp; Cabinet,&nbsp; in a&nbsp; meeting held on January 26, 1955,&nbsp; cancelled the aforesaid License No. 16679 on the ground that it&nbsp; was illegally&nbsp; issued&nbsp; "in&nbsp; that no fixed&nbsp; date&nbsp; of expiration is stipulated."<br><br>After considering the case relative&nbsp; to the seizure of the shipment, the&nbsp; Collector of Customs found that the same was not covered by a valid license as required by Central Bank Circular No. 45&nbsp; and,&nbsp; consequently, he decreed its forfeiture to the Government.&nbsp; Not satisfied with his decision, respondent appealed to the Commissioner of Customs, who affirmed&nbsp; the decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Collector of&nbsp; Customs. In&nbsp; due time,&nbsp; respondent appealed to the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals&nbsp; by filing a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; review. The Court of Tax Appeals, after&nbsp; due hearing, rendered decision reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Customs and ordering the cancellation of the surety bond filed in substitution of the shipment.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; an appeal from said&nbsp; decision.<br><br>It appears that the shipment in question was imported by respondent on the strength of Import License No. 16679 issued&nbsp; by the Import Control&nbsp; Commission on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 12, 1953 under Republic Act No. 650.&nbsp; The shipment arrived in Manila&nbsp; on November 7,&nbsp; 1954 and immediately&nbsp; was seized&nbsp; by the customs authorities&nbsp; on the ground that it is not&nbsp; covered by a license as required by Central Bank Circular&nbsp; No. 45.&nbsp; It also&nbsp; appears that&nbsp; after&nbsp; said shipment arrived&nbsp; in Manila and while the seizure&nbsp; case&nbsp; was pending&nbsp; investigation by the Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs, the Cabinet in a meeting held on January 26,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; cancelled the aforesaid license on the only ground that&nbsp; "no fixed date of expiration is stipulated therein."&nbsp; The issue now&nbsp; to be determined is,&nbsp; is&nbsp; this cancellation justified. It&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; disputed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Cabinet may&nbsp; under&nbsp; the law&nbsp; pass on&nbsp; the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of any license that&nbsp; may be issued&nbsp; by the Import Control Commission.&nbsp; It may&nbsp; also action&nbsp; as may be taken by the President.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is clearly inferred&nbsp; from Section 2, Republic Act No. 650 which&nbsp; provides that the import license therein authorized shall be issued&nbsp; by the President through any&nbsp; instrumentality he may choose to assist him in carrying out the provisions of said&nbsp; Act and that such&nbsp; instrumentality can&nbsp; question the validity of the license&nbsp; so issued, the only limitation&nbsp; being&nbsp; that the same may be appealed to the President. In other words, it&nbsp; is only the&nbsp; President, on appeal,&nbsp; who&nbsp;&nbsp; can determine the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of any&nbsp; license that may be issued&nbsp; by the Import Control Commission.&nbsp; It&nbsp; may&nbsp; also be admitted that the President can act through his&nbsp; Cabinet and that the acts of the latter&nbsp; may be&nbsp; considered&nbsp;&nbsp; as those&nbsp; of the former unless they are disapproved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; But&nbsp; while&nbsp; the Cabinet,&nbsp; acting&nbsp; for the&nbsp; President,&nbsp; can pass on the validity of a license issued by the Import Control Commission,&nbsp; that power cannot be arbitrarily exercised.&nbsp; The action must be founded on good ground&nbsp; or reason&nbsp; and must not be capricious or whimsical.&nbsp;&nbsp; This principle is so clear to require further&nbsp; elaboration.<br><br>&nbsp;Was this power&nbsp; properly exercised in the instant case. The answer must&nbsp; of necessity be in the negative,&nbsp; for it appears that the&nbsp; license issued to respondent&nbsp; to&nbsp; import the shipment in question was cancelled on the only ground that it does not bear any expiry date even if the importation&nbsp; had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been made and the shipment had already reached the port of Manila.&nbsp; Had the license been cancelled on the ground before the importation had been effected, the same&nbsp; may be justified, for indeed a&nbsp; license as a rule must be&nbsp; limited in point of time, but not when the importation has been accomplished and the importer had made commitments with the dealer and assumed other obligations&nbsp; incident thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact, if the cancellation were to prevail, the importer&nbsp; would&nbsp; stand to lose the license fee he paid amounting&nbsp; to P12,000.00, plus the value of the shipment amounting to&nbsp; P21,820.00.&nbsp; This is grossly inequitable.&nbsp; Moreover, "it has been held in a great number of cases that a permit or license may not arbitrarily be&nbsp; revoked&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; where,&nbsp; on the faith of it, the&nbsp; owner has&nbsp; incurred material expense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>It has also been&nbsp; held that "where the licensee has acted under the license in good faith, and has incurred expense in the execution of it, by&nbsp; making valuable improvements or otherwise, it is regarded in equity as an executed contract and&nbsp; substantially&nbsp; an easement, the revocation of which would be a fraud on the licensee, and therefore the licensor is&nbsp;&nbsp; estopped to revoke&nbsp; it,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; It has&nbsp; also been held that the&nbsp; license cannot be revoked without reimbursing&nbsp; the licensee for his expenditures&nbsp; or&nbsp; otherwise placing him in <i>status quo</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp; (53 C.&nbsp; J. S., 816-817) Having reached&nbsp; the conclusion&nbsp; that the&nbsp; license of respondent has been&nbsp; improperly cancelled, there is no need for him&nbsp; to obtain another license under Central Bank Circular No. 15.&nbsp; Consequently, the seizure of said shipment is&nbsp; unjustified.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed, without&nbsp; costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
