				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF DR. MAXIMO BORROMEO. JOHANNA HOFER BORROMEO, WIDOW AND APPELLEE, VS. CANUTO O. BORROMEO, EXECUTOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, ACTING C.J:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In July 1948, Dr. Maximo Borromeo, a resident of Cebu City, died without 
ascendants or descendants, but leaving his widow Johanna Hofer Borromeo, and a 
will wherein he designated the Borromeo Bros. Estate Inc. as his sole heir, even 
as he named his brother Canuto O. Borromeo as the executor. The said corporation 
is owned entirely by the deceased and his brothers and sisters.
<p>Proceedings having been instituted, the court of first instance of that 
province probated the will in due course, and granted letters testamentary to 
Canuto O. Borromeo, who duly qualified as such executor.</p>
<p>Thereafter, on July 11,1949, the attorneys for the widow submitted an "Urgent 
Motion" whereby they prayed for the removal of the executor on the grounds of 
negligence in the performance of his duties and unfitness to continue 
discharging the powers of the office.</p>
<p>This motion was scheduled to be heard on July 13, 1949 but it was postponed 
upon representations by the executor of possible amicable settlement between the 
opposing parties. No settlement was carried out nor even attempted. However, 
taking advantage of the postponement and after a subpoena had been served on the 
Bank of the Philippine Islands seeking information on the cash deposits therein 
of the deceased Maximo Borromeo, the executor withdrew, without authority from 
the court, the total amount of P23,930.39 from a joint current account, in said 
Bank, of Canuto Borromeo and Maximo Borromeo, and then deposited P22,244.39 of 
the sum thus withdrawn in the joint account of said Canuto Borromeo and his 
brother Exequiel.</p>
<p>In time the petition was heard, and voluminous evidence, oral and 
documentary, was submitted. Thereafter on February 21, 1951 the Honorable 
Edmundo Piccio, Judge, for several reasons, one of them the above withdrawal of 
funds, decreed the removal of the executor. On motion for reconsideration the 
executor's attorney prayed that the order be revoked or that at least, the 
executor be permitted to resign. (Record on Appeal p. 251.)</p>
<p>On March 29, 1951 obviously to accommodate the executor—there being no 
practical difference between removal and resignation—His Honor modified his 
order in the sense that said executor was "relieved of (instead of removed from) 
his commitments as such executor". Notwithstanding such modification the 
executor appealed, contending that the modified order should be revoked. </p>
<p>There is no question that an order removing the executor or administrator is 
appealable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> But we fail to perceive 
the utility of the instant appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
inasmuch as the executor begged to be permitted to resign and the court all but 
granted his request explaining, specifically, that the executor was not removed 
but only relieved of his commitment—which is one way of accepting the proffered 
resignation. The executor got substantially what he wanted.</p>
<p>Granting that the modified order was not literally what he desired, still the 
error, if any, did not affect his substantial rights, and could not justify 
reversal under the Rules, (cf. Rule 53 sec. 3.)</p>
<p>In any event, supposing he was removed, there were in our opinion sufficient 
grounds therefor. Take the matter of withdrawals above described. Attempting to 
justify his attitude, the executor points out that, according to the joint 
deposit agreement Exhibit H signed by Canuto and Maximo Borromeo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We, the undersigned, agree with one another and with the Bank of the 
Philippine Islands hereinafter called the Bank, that all moneys heretofore, now, 
or hereafter deposited, by us, or any of us, to the credit of this Saving 
Account or Current Account, are and shall be received and held by the Bank with 
'the understanding, and upon the condition that said money deposited, without 
reference to previous ownerships, and all interest, dividends and credits 
thereon shall be the property of all of us as joint owners and shall be payable 
to and collectible by anyone of us, during our lifetimes and <em>after the death 
of any one of us shall be the sole property of and payable to the survivors, or 
survivor</em>, provided that this last deposition is not contrary to provisions 
of laws now in force or may hereafer be in force in the Philippine Islands." 
(Italics ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>He claims, in effect, that the money deposited was his at the time he 
withdrew it. But would the Bank have allowed him to withdraw the whole amount if 
he were not the executor? He got it then as executor, and should have kept it in 
his account as executor. Instead, he deposited it in a joint account with his 
brother Exequiel, thereby placing it at the latter's disposal, and hiding it 
from the widow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, and this is important, the agreement says "provided that this 
last disposition is not contrary to provisions of laws now in force * * * in the 
P.I." The question arises: may a husband validly agree that upon his death 
certain conjugal money deposited in the bank shall belong to his brother, and 
thereby deprive his wife of her share in the conjugal partnership?</p>
<p>According to Art. 1413 of the Civil Code, no alienation or agreement which 
the husband may make with respect to conjugal property in fraud of the wife 
shall prejudice her or her heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>There is at least some ground to doubt whether the stipulation could deprive 
the wife of her share in the conjugal assets. The validity of the agreement 
could properly be the subject of debate in court; yet this executor avoided or 
bypassed judicial adjudication by getting the money, specially at a time when 
his actuations were already being questioned, and his appointment as executor in 
danger of revocation. And his conduct is aggravated by the circumstance that he 
took advantage of a postponement, asked by him on the false pretense of possible 
amicable settlement, in order to vest in himself money on which the corporate 
heir and the widow might have a claim.</p>
<p>Another reason for the removal is the fact that in his Report for March 1949 
the executor omitted to include, as income of the estate, the sum of P6,000 
which he had received from Hacienda Plaridel of the decedent. This in itself 
might be involuntary error, as claimed by him. But considering that he received 
other sums of P13,010 and P10,559.40 as proceeds from the farm of the deceased, 
but instead of depositing them in his name as executor, placed them in his joint 
account with his brother Exequiel Borromeo, it is not unreasonable to suspect a 
plan—inconsistent with his trusteeship—to conceal the money of the deceased to 
back up his assertion, in objecting to the widow's allowance, that the estate 
had no funds.</p>
<p>A third reason is that the executor claimed <em>as his own</em> certain 
shares of the Interisland Gas Service, in the name of Maximo Borromeo, valued at 
P12,000; he asserted that Maximo was merely his "dummy". If we had any doubts 
about the Tightness of the trial judge's determination, this circumstance should 
finally tip the judicial balance on the side of removal or resignation. Conflict 
between the interest of the executor and the interest of the deceased is ground 
for removal or resignation of the former, who was thereby become unsuitable to 
discharge the trust (Section 2, Rule 83.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An executor or administrator should be removed where his personal interests 
conflict with his official duties, but a mere hostile feeling towards persons 
interested in the estate is not ground for removal unless it prevents the 
management of the estate according to the dictates of prudence." (33 C. J. S. P. 
1036.) (Citing many cases.)</p>
<p>"<em>Reasons for rule</em>.—'An executor is a quasi trustee, who should be 
indifferent between the estate and claimants of the property, except to preserve 
it for due administration, and when his interest conflicts with such right and 
duty the county court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may remove him.' 
(In re Manser, 60 Or. 240, 246, 118 p. 1024.) </p>
<p>"An executor will be removed where it appears that he asserts claims against 
the .estate of the testator to the exent of two-thirds of the value of the 
estate, and such claims are disputed by the beneficiary under the will.' 
(Henry's Est., 54 Pa. Super. 274.)</p>
<p>"<em>Claim of gift from decedent</em>,—Where an executor, in answer to a 
petition for his removal oh the ground of maladministration in claiming property 
of the estate, alleged a gift by decedent to him of the property, he manifested 
an interest adverse to the beneficiaries, authorizing his removal; but the. 
county court had no jurisdiction to determine the question of gift." (In re 
Manser, 60 Or. 240, 118 p. 1024.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It becomes unnecessary to examine the other reasons which induced the trial 
court to let this executor go. The record discloses sufficient data justifying 
the decree of separation or vindicating the judge's exercise of discretion. 
This, apart from the principle supported by the weight of authorities that, "An 
appellate court is disinclined to interfere with the action taken by the probate 
court in the matter of the removal of an executor or administrator unless 
positive error or gross abuse of discretion is shown." (33 C. J. S. p. 1048.) 
Citing many cases.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed order should be, as it is hereby, affirmed with 
double costs against appellant. It should be stated in this connection that for 
obvious reasons, no petition for extension of the time to file a motion for 
reconsideration will be favorably entertained. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Padilla, Labrador, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, A., Concepcion</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>
