				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Appellant Teodoro Cantos, <i>alias</i> Teodoro Tatishi, is 
accused of the complex crime of treason with quadruple murder and robbery under 
the information which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"That during the Japanese Military occupation of the 
Philippines, especially on or about the dates herein below mentioned, in the 
different places hereinafter stated and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named acccused, Teodoro Cantos, <i>alias</i> Teodoro 
Tatishi, not being a foreigner but a citizen of the Philippines, owing 
allegiance to the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines, in 
violation of said allegiance, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, 
feloniously and treasonable adhere to their enemy, the Empire of Japan, with 
which the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines (are at war, 
gave) aid and/or comfort in the following manner, to wit:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. That on or about December 28, 1941, at or near Davao City, 
Mindanao, Philippines, for the purpose of giving and with intent to give aid 
and/or comfort to the enemy, the above-named accused, Teodoro Cantos, 
<i>alias</i> Teodoro Tatishi, who was a member of the Japanese Civilian Army, 
conspiring and confabulating with other Japanese and helping each other, did 
then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously tie the hands of Sixto 
Babao, Dalmacio Babao, Francisco Cabling and Martin Marquez, and did with 
treachery kill all of them.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. That on or about January 7, 1942, at or near Ilang, Davao 
City, Mindanao, Philippines, for the purpose of giving and with intent to give 
aid and/or comfort to the enemy, the above-named accused, Teodoro Cantos, 
<i>alias</i> Teodoro Tatishi, who was a member of the Japanese Civilian Army, 
conspiring and confabulating with other Japanese and helping each other, did 
then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with violence against or 
intimidation of persons and with intent to gain, loot, take and carry away 
personal properties belonging to Justina Larracoechea Babao, consisting of food, 
canned goods, soap, shoes, eyeglasses, etc."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">After trial the lower court found him guilty of the crime 
alleged in the information and sentenced him to death, to pay a fine of P15,000, 
to pay an indemnity of P2,000 and of P500 to the heirs of Sixto Babao, the 
latter amount as payment for the articles robbed and not recovered; to pay an 
indemnity of P2,000 to the heirs of Dalmacio Babao; to pay an indemnity of 
P2,000 to the heirs of Francisco Cabling; to pay an indemnity of P2,000 to the 
heirs of Martin Marquez, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court ordered the case remanded to the Supreme Court 
in view of the death penalty imposed to the accused.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant's attorney <i>de oficio</i> contends in his brief 
that the trial court erred in finding appellant guilty of the complex crime of 
treason with multiple murder and robbery and in sentencing him to death. At the 
trial six witnesses testified in direct evidence for the prosecution: Justina 
Larracoechea Babao, Andrea B. Cabling, Antonio Rasay, Igleceria Bacalso, 
Napoleon Zapanta, Zoilo de las Verlas, and as a rebuttal witness, Vicente Hizon 
Panlilio. For the defense testified the accused himself and his wife, Lucila, 
Adrales.</p>
<p align="justify">The prosecution tried to prove by its witnesses that on 
December 24, 1941, four days after the Japanese had captured the City of Davao, 
Vicente Tatishi appeared in the house of Segundo Basalo in Ilang, where the 
spouses Sixto Babao and Justina Larracoechea were living. Not finding Basalo, 
Vicente left word that Sixto Babao should surrender his firearms to the Japanese 
army, and Francisco Cabling, Dalmacio Babao, Martin Marquez, then living with 
Sixto, should get their passes. On December 27 Vicente called again at the same 
house and told Justina Larracoechea that if her husband failed to present his 
firearms to the Japanese, soldiers would be sent to kill them all. In the 
morning of December 28, 1941, Sixto Babao bringing with him his shotgun and 
revolver and displaying a white flag and Dalmacio Babao, Francisco Cabling and 
Martin Marquez went to the Japanese garrison in the premises of the Tibungco 
Lumber Company in Ilang. The Japanese herded them in the office of the company, 
tied their hands at the back and at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon brought 
them to the pier of the Tibungco Lumber Co. where, with their faces covered, 
they were made to stand facing the water, with their backs towards the firing 
squad composed of Fuji, a Japanese, Masahiro Tatishi and his children Vicente 
and Teodoro Tatishi. Ichida Matsuda, another Japanese, ordered the firing. Three 
shots were fired, killing Dalmacio Babao, Martin Marquez and Francisco Cabling. 
As Sixto Babao continued still standing, three other shots were fired by 
Teodoro, Vicente and Masahiro Tatishi, felling him down. Okabe, another 
Japanese, chopped off Sixto's head and, thereafter, the corpses of the four 
victims were thrown into the sea. The news of the killing itself were confirmed 
by appellant on January 7, 1942, when he personally told about it to the widow 
of Sixto, adding that the reason for Sixto's killing was because he was a 
parashooter of the volunteer guards, while the three others were shot so they 
could not reveal the death of Sixto.</p>
<p align="justify">The prosecution also offered evidence to show that at about 10 
o'clock in the morning of January 7, 1942, appellant and his father Masahiro and 
brothers Juan and Vicente, all armed with shotguns and accompanied by other 
persons similarly armed, appeared in the house of Justina Larracoechea and asked 
for foodstuffs. As Justina refused to accede to the demand, Teodoro searched the 
house stating that he was a volunteer in the Japanese army and as such he had 
the right to confiscate properties of Filipinos or kill them. The group 
appropriated canned goods, toilet articles, shoes, eyeglasses and two police 
dogs, and left with a loot valued at P500. </p>
<p align="justify">The evidence presented by the prosecution appears to be 
convincing and the mere denials of the appellant and his weak defense of alibi, 
supported only by the corroboration of his wife, is not enough to shake the 
credibility of the prosecution witnesses, it appearing, as admitted by appellant 
himself, they had absolutely no reason for testifying falsely against him. We 
are of opinion that the facts had happened as narrated by the witnesses for the 
prosecution, the substance of whose testimonies is above-stated.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court erred, however, in finding appellant guilty of 
the crime of treason because, as pointed in the prosecution's brief itself, the 
evidence failed to satisfy the two-witness rule provided by article 114 of the 
Revised Penal Code. Napoleon Zapanta is the only witness who testified as to 
appellant's actual participation in the killing of Sixto Babao, Dalmacio Babao, 
Francisco Cabling and Martin Marquez and no one of the other witnesses for the 
prosecution had seen the actual killing.</p>
<p align="justify">We are satisfied, however, that the evidence offers enough 
ground to find appellant guilty of murder for his participation in the killing 
of the four victims. The appellant appears to be guilty of four distinct murders 
qualified by treachery with the aggravating circumstance of having been 
committed in band, offset by the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction, 
for which reason there is no basis to impose upon appellant four sentences of 
death, one for each murder, as recommended by the prosecution</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the evidence, appellant appears also to be guilty of 
robbery with intimidation committed in the house of Justina Larracoechea on 
January 7, 1942, with the aggravating circumstance of in band.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court's judgment is modified and appellant is 
sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each of the four murders of Sixto 
Babao, Dalmacio Babao, Francisco Cabling and Martin Marquez, and to indemnify 
the heirs of each one of the four victims in the sum of P6,000 in accordance 
with the decision in People vs. Amansec<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (L-927, 45 Off. Gaz. [Supp. to No. 9], 
51), and for the crime of robbery he is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 
not less than one month and one day of <i>arresto mayor </i>and not more than 
six (6) years, ten (10) months and one day of <i>prision mayor</i>, and to 
indemnify the heirs of Sixto Babao in the sum of P500, with costs.</p>
