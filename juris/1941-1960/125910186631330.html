CIPRIANO B. MOTOS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT,  VS.  ROBERTO SOLER, ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On  October  5,  1943,  appellant,  Cipriano  B.  Motos, executed  a  written  promise  to  sell to  appellee,  Roberto Soler,  two  adjoining  parcels of land situated in barrio Palestina, Pili, Camarines Sur,  for  P2,350.00, of which he  received from the latter  on  that date  the  sum of P300.00.  Their understanding was that with said amount he  Would pay a  certain  bank  and  all taxes  due on the property  and would secure the  cancellation of any  other encumbrance  thereon so as to be in a position to execute the corresponding deed of sale.</p>
<p>It appears that in spite of the fact that Soler was ready, willing and able to pay the unpaid  balance  due on. the purchase price, appellant kept on putting off the execution of the deed  of  sale until, finally, he  offered to return the partial payment of P300.00—which Soler refused to accept—and later formally notified the latter that he had decided not to sell the lands aforementioned.  Thereafter Soler  made repeated offers to pay  the  unpaid balance of the purchase price, making on each occasion the proper demand  for the execution of  the corresponding deed of sale, but the  same were ignored by  Motos.  As a result, on April 19, 1944, Soler commenced against him  Civil Case No.  225,  R-38,  for specific performance and to obtain a declaration of ownership over the aforementioned parcels of land.  Simultaneously with the commencement of the  action, he  consigned the sum of P2,050.00  with: the court.   On September  4, 1944, judgment was rendered declaring the contract  of promise to sell of October 5, 1943, inoperative as to one of the  two parcels of land covered thereby but, as to the other, Motos was ordered to execute a deed of absolute  sale in favor of Soler, the latter to pay its value  in proportion to  the  total prtee agreed upon,  less  the sum of P300.00  paid in advance. The decision, however,  gave  Soler an  option to rescind the contract or  demand its fulfillment the  same to  be exercised within  thirty days from notice of said decision. No appeal was  ever taken from  the same.</p>
<p>Upon  application of  Soler,   the records  of the  case, destroyed during the war, were  reconstituted  in  1947, but  it was only on December 20, 1950  that,  upon his motion—the date of filing thereof not  appearing in the record—a writ of execution was issued  "for the enforcement of the  first  option, namely:  the purchase  of the first parcel of land."  (Record on Appeal p. 45).  Motos, however,  refused and  otherwise failed to execute  the to issue  another order  dated May 2,  1952, for the same purpose.   He  filed  two different motions for reconsideration of said order,  but  they were denied  on March 19, 1955, this last order further providing that should Motos not execute the deed  of  sale on or before April 15  of said year,  the  court  would  direct the provincial  sheriff to do it in his name and behalf.</p>
<p>On  April 14, 1955, Motos finally  executed a deed  of sale of  the land in question in favor of Soler, with  a provision to the effect that the  land may be  repurchased by the  vendor  within five  years from the  execution  of the deed  of sale.  Upon  objection of Soler, the  court disapproved the deed  of sale on July 9 of the same year and once more required  Motos  to  execute a  deed  of  absolute sale  within  10  days from notice.   The latter then filed a petition  for certiorari with the Court of Appeals (G. R. No. 15495) to  secure  annulment of this last order, but the  same was dismissed principally upon the ground that appeal  and not  certiorari  was the  proper remedy.</p>
<p>Finally,  because of  Motos' refusal  to  execute a deed of absolute sale in conformity with the decision  rendered in Civil  Case No. 225, R-38, upon authority of the court, the provincial  sheriff executed  the  corresponding deed of absolute  sale in favor of Soler on August  11,  1955. Subsequently, the latter was placed in possession of the land subject-matter of the  sale and  the corresponding transfer certificate of  title was issued in his name.  Some time thereafter, he conveyed the  property to his son Jaime Soler,  in whose name, in turn  transfer certificate  No. 1524 was  issued.</p>
<p>On October 30, 1955, that is, 4 years,  11 months and 17 days  after the issuance of the writ of execution mentioned heretofore, but  scarcely two  months and two days after the execution of  the deed  of  sale by the provincial sheriff,   Motos commenced this  action to compel Soler and his son to allow him to repurchase the land pursuant to the provisions of section 119  of the Public Land Act.</p>
<p>In their answer to the complaint, after specifically admitting  some material averments  thereof  and  denying others, the Solers alleged, by way of  affirmative defenses, "that  (1)  Motos had no  cause  of  action against them; (2) that the provisions of the Public Land Act  did not apply to the land  in  question;  and (3)  that whatever right  of repurchase Motos had, the same  had  already prescribed.  By way of counterclaim, they sought to recover  moral  and actual damages in  an  amount not less than  P10,000.00. </p>
<p>After due trial, the  lower court rendered the appealed judgment ruling that Motos' right to  repurchase the land in  question was already barred  by  the decision rendered in  Civil Case No. 225, R-38,  and that,  at any rate, the period of five years  within which he could exercise said right had already elapsed.  These are the principal rulings assailed by Motos in this appeal and, as  a  consequence, he  also contends that the trial  court erred in not ordering the Solers to reconvey the land in  question  to him for and in consideration of the sum of P119.92 in Philippine currency.</p>
<p>Upon the facts of record we are of  the opinion that the lower  court erred in holding that, by reason  of the rule of conclusiveness of  judgment, Motos is barred from raising the question of his right  to repurchase the land in question.  It  must  be  remembered  that  Roberto  Soler instituted Civil  Case No. 225, R-38,  to compel Motos to comply with  the contract  of promise to sell referred to heretofore and that, after due trial,  the court rendered judgment requiring  Motos to execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of Soler, giving the latter, however, an option, to be exercised within thirty days from notice, to demand either  specific performance  or to rescind the contract. The case did not involve Motos, right to repurchase  neither directly nor indirectly.  When  Soler exercised  said option by  asking for the issuance of a  writ of execution  commanding Motes to execute a deed of sale; when the  court issued said writ and later disapproved the deed  of sale submitted  by Motos, the  only matter before the court and the only one it could resolve was whether, in accordance with the  decision aforesaid, Motos should execute  a deed of  absolute sale.   For the resolution of  said  question it was  not  necessary for  the  court to  resolve  the other question  of whether  or  not1 Motos  was  still  entitled to exercise the right to repurchase  the property.  In fact, the  aforesaid decision unequivocally stated that the consideration of said question was premature because it was improper to talk  about  the right to repurchase  before the  execution of the deed of  sale.   (Record  on Appeal p. 43.)  Inasmuch as that alone is deemed adjudged by a former  judgment which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and  necessarily included  therein or  necessary  thereto  (Section 45,  Rule 39, Rules of Court),  it seems obvious that, as the lower court  held in deciding said case, Motos  could raise the question  of his  right to  repurchase  only after the execution of the deed  of sale.</p>
<p>Neither can  it  be said  that  the question was resolved by the Court of Appeals when  it denied or dismissed the petition for certiorari filed  by  Motos for the  annulment of the order of the lower court disapproving the deed of sale submitted  by  him,  firstly,  because  a  special  civil action for certiorari involves exclusively questions of jurisdiction, and secondly, because the Court  of Appeals dismissed the aforesaid petition principally upon the ground that an appeal  and not a petition for certiorari was the proper remedy.</p>
<p>It  is not  disputed that  appellant acquired the  land in question as  a homestead on  September 4,  1935 and that  original  certificate  of title  No.  1327 (Homestead Patent) was issued  in his  name (Stipulation  of  Facts, Record on Appeal p. 38).  It can not be denied, therefore, that the provisions of the Public Land Act regarding the vendor's right to repurchase are applicable to the present case.</p>
<p>The next question  to be determined is from what date shall  the period  of five years within which Motos could exercise the right to repurchase in accordance with Section 119 of the Public  Land Act be counted?  The provision referred to provides that the  right  to repurchase shall be exercised "within  a period of five  years from the date of the conveyance."  Said  date. could not be October  5, 1943  because the contract entered into between the parties on that date was merely a contract of promise to sell and not a deed of conveyance.   Neither  can we agree with the trial court that  the period must be deemed to have started somewhere  between October 5, 1943 and the date when Motos was finally in a position to execute the deed of conveyance, for the simple reason that there is  no conclusive evidence showing exactly  when  Motos finally found himself  in a position to execute the  deed  of  sale because he had paid the taxes due and secured cancellation of all liens existing on the property.</p>
<p>The lower court held the view that if the period of repurchase could not have legally begun from anyone of the dates aforesaid because  the decision rendered in the case gave Roberto Soler the right to choose between rescission and specific performance,  then the period must be counted  from the date when Soler filed a motion for the issuance  of, or when the court issued the writ of execution ordering Motos to execute the required deed of sale.   There is no  conclusive  proof as to the date when said motion was filed, but it is  not disputed that the writ was issued on December 20, 1950.</p>
<p>While  a strict construction of the legal provision under consideration leads to the conclusion that the period of five years therein provided started only upon the execution of the deed  of conveyance  by  the provincial sheriff  on August 11, 1955, rather than on  the date when the writ of execution referred to was issued,  it is  manifest that, in either case  the  present action,  commenced on October 13,  1955, was filed within the  aforesaid period.</p>
<p>The only question now remaining to be  resolved is: what should be the amount to be paid by appellant for the repurchase of the land in question.</p>
<p>According to the  deed of sale executed by the provincial sheriff in favor of Roberto  Soler, the consideration paid by  the  latter for the land in question  was  Pl,079.31 in Japanese  military notes (Stipulation  of  Facts, Annex J, Record  on  Appeal,  p.  71),  deposited by Soler with the clerk of court on April 19,  1944 when he filed  the action for specific performance.  Pursuant to  the  decision rendered in Garrido <em>vs</em>. North Camarines Lumber Co., 44 Off. Gaz. No. 11, p. 4401, the consideration for the repurchase must be paid  in the present currency on the basis of the Ballantyne  schedule or ratio which shows that on April 1944, P9.00 in Japanese war notes  were equivalent to P1.00, Philippine currency.   Consequently, the repurchase must be made for a consideration of P119.92.</p>
<p>In  view  of  all the foregoing, the appealed judgment is hereby reversed  and another is rendered declaring that appellant  Motos has the right to repurchase the land in question from appellee Jaime F. Soler, the latter to execute the corresponding  deed of resale upon  payment of the sum  of P119.92.  Costs against appellees.</p>

<p align="right"><em>May 31, 1961</em></p>
<p><strong>DIZON, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Before us 'is appellees' second  motion for the reconsideration of our  resolution dated  November  25,  1960 and February  10,  1961.</p>
<p>The resolution of November 25, 1960 denied appellees' motion for the  modification of the dispositive part of the decision rendered in this case, on the ground that the same was filed out of time.  We agree with appellees that said resolution should  be, as  it is  hereby, reconsidered, because  the record shows  that  their aforesaid motion was timely filed. It  appears in  this connection that appellees received notice of the decision on October 13, 1960.  On the 26th of the same month they filed a motion for extension of the time to file a motion for reconsideration, and two days thereafter this Court granted them an extension of 20  days from October  28 for the aforesaid purpose, which extension expired on November 17,  1960. On November 16 they mailed, by registered special delivery, their motion to  secure a modification of the  dispositive part of the decision—which was actually received by the Clerk  of Court  on the  18th  of  the  same month. But as, according to the Rules, the date of mailing in this case should be considered as the date of filing, the said motion must be deemed  to have"been  filed on  time.</p>
<p>In connection with the resolution of  February 10, 1961, it appears  that  a copy  of  the former resolution dated November  25,  1960 was received by  Rogelio  Tobias,  a clerk in the law office of Atty. Orino on December 3, 1960; Tobias placed it in a folder kept in a locked  drawer of his desk, intending to bring it to  the attention  of Atty. Orino—who was then already  out of the office—the following Monday, December 5; it happened, however, that Tobias was  taken ill and  was hospitalized from December 4 to December 23 and  reported back to the law-office of Atty. Orino only  on December 27, and it was  only then that he  was able to deliver  the notice referred  to Atty. Orino, who, in turn, delivered  it to Atty. Pardalis.  Two days thereafter  the latter filed the motion for reconsideration dated  December 28, 1960,  which was denied by our resolution  of February 10,  1961, notice of this denial  having  been  received  by  appellees' counsel on February 23, of the same year.</p>
<p>In  view  of the  setting aside  of our  Resolution  of November 25, 1960,  and the fact that appellees' motion for reconsideration dated December 28, 1960 was verified and. duly accompanied by affidavits of merit, our Resolution of February  10,  1961  is also set  aside.</p>
<p>The main question now before us,  therefore,  is whether the dispositive part  of our  decision should be  modified as prayed for by appellees in their  motion of November 11, 1960.  It is  alleged therein that while  the  decision rendered  in this case granted appellant the right  to  re-purchase the property in question for the sum of P119.92, it did not provide—and so they asked—for  the  remanding of the case to the lower court for further proceedings to enable appellees to present evidence bearing upon the value of  the  improvements  that  they had made on the aforesaid property since acquiring the same from  appellant in August, 1955—a right they claim  to be entitled to as  possessors in  good  faith.</p>
<p>The motion  is without merit. The present action was instituted by  Cipriano B. Motos to compel appellees to allow him  to  repurchase  the property  described in  his complaint.  In the latter's answer they denied Motos' right to repurchase under  the  Public  Land Act  and further alleged that,  if he ever had such right,  the  same had already  prescribed.</p>
<p>In  view  of the  issue involved, we  believe that the value  of whatever  improvements  may have  been  introduced  in the  property by appellees  during the time they were in  possession should have been litigated below by setting up the corresponding counterclaim.  Appellees' failure to do  so now bars their claim (Berses <em>vs</em>. Villanueva, 25 Phil., 473; Beltran <em>vs</em>. Valbuena, 53  Phil., 697; Pascual <em>vs</em>. Lesaca,  L-4536,  May 30, 1952).</p>
<p>Wherefore,  appellees' motion  for the' modification of the dispositive part of the decision of this Court is hereby denied.</p>
