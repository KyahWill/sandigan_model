				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of a decision of the Court of Appeals which 
orders defendants, now petitioners, to vacate the land in question and to 
deliver the same to plaintiffs, now respondents, and to pay' to the latter the 
rentals received by said defendants from Marcosa Sonoria, Flaviana Narciso and 
Quirino Catanales, from the filing of the complaint until the delivery of the 
land. It is likewise ordered that the court of origin re-open the case for the 
purpose of determining the value of the improvements made by Ponciana Rago on 
the land so that she may be adequately reimbursed therefor.
<p>This appeal stems from an action for the recovery of a piece of land and 
damages instituted by plaintiffs, now respondents, before the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu. It is claimed that they are owners pro-indiviso of the land, 
known as Lot No. 4700 of the cadastral survey of Cebu city; that in 1945 
defendants, without plaintiffs' consent, occupied the southern portion of said 
land and constructed thereon four houses and one camarin for rental purposes and 
gathered the products of ten coconut trees growing thereon and that, defendants 
having refused to vacate the portion they are occupying, they prayed that 
defendants be prdered to deliver its possession to them and to pay the costs and 
corresponding damages.</p>
<p>Defendants, in their last amended answer, alleged that Ponciana Rago has been 
in possession of a certain portion of Lot No. 4700 since 1917, the same having 
been purchased by her late rather Teodoro Rago from Mariano Abella and later 
donated, to her during her first marriage; that in the extra-judicial partition 
made by the late father of Ponciana, the northern portion of Lot No. 4700 was 
adjudicated to Ciriaco Rago, plaintiffs' father and Ponciana's brother, which 
portion was bought by the deceased from Sor Damiana; and that, Ponciana Rago 
being the owner of the sour them portion of said lot, defendants prayed that 
she:be declared the owner thereof and the complaint be dismissed.</p>
<p>After due trial, the lower court rendered decision dismissing tbje complaint 
as prayed for by the defendants, but when the case was taken on appeal to the 
Court of Appeals, the decision yas reversed and a new one was entered the 
dispositive part of which appears stated in the early part of this decision. 
Defendants interposed the present petition for review and in their brief they 
now impute eight errors to the appellate court.</p>
<p>The facts of this case, as found by the Court of Appeals, are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The following facts are not disputed: Lot No. 4700, which is now in 
question, originally belonged to the deceased spouses Teodoro Rago and Macjaria 
Gabuya and was registered in their names. On October 28, 1919, the same spouses 
executed a deed of partition, dividing their properties among their children 
(Exh. 'A').</p>
<p>"On October 23, 1940, Ciriaco Rago one of the children of the aforenamed 
spouses and father of plaintiffs, presented a motion in the 'Expediente 
Cadastral1 No. 13, G.L.R.O. Record 9469, asking for the cancellation of the 
original certificate of title No. 3338 of Lot No. 4700, which was in the name of 
the spouses Teodoro Rago and Macaria Gabuya, and in lieu of which to issue a new 
certificate of title in movant's favor, on the ground that said lot was 
adjudicated to him in the extra-judicial partition (Exh. 'A'). Acting upon this 
motion, the lower court issued on July 29, 1941, an order granting the; same 
(Exh 'B'). Consequently, on August 28,, 1941, Attys. Hipolito Alo and Filiberto 
Leonardo, in representation of Fortunata Rago, Fiilemon Rago and defendant 
Ponciana Rago filed a motion, which was sworn to by Filemon Rago, asking for the 
reconsideration of said order, for the reason that the parcel of land 
adjudicated in favor of Ciriaco Rago by virtue of the deed of partition (Exh. 
'A') was only a portion of Lot. No. 4700 of the Cadastral survey of Cebu City, 
and not the entire lot (Exh. 'B').</p>
<p>"When the motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the court on 
September 6, 1941, was filed, Ponciana Rago was living in Nibonga and according 
to her she never authorized her brother, Filemon, to act in her name nor appear 
in court in connection with said motion. On September 17 of that year, 
aforenamed counsel appealed from the aforesaid order and, after the approval of 
the record on appeal (Exh. 'B'), the same was certified to the Court of Appeals 
which, on the ground of abandonment, dismissed the same (Exhs. 'C' &amp; 
'D').</p>
<p>"Alleging that his father, yiriaco Rago, died on June 21, 1945, Francisco 
Rago filed a motion on November 12, 1945, in phe aforesaid cadastral case No. 13 
(Record No. 9469) praying that the original certificate of title No. 3^38 be 
cancelled and that a I new one be issueql in favor of the children of the 
deceased Ciriaio. Acting upon this motion, the lower court on January 19,1946, 
ordered that a new certificate of title in the name of the heirs of Cifiaco Rago 
be issued. The record also shows that no title in plaintiff' name has as yet 
boen issued pursuant to the order of January 19, 1946 (Exh. 'J').</p>
<p>"Similarly, there is no dispute that in the year 1947, Surveyor Leon U. 
Gonzaga made a relocation of the questioned1, Lot No. 4700, preparing a plan 
thereof (Exh. 'A'); that during the relocation, one of the sons of the 
defendants appeared and claimed, in the name of Ms mother, the southern portion 
of said Lot No. 4700, which portion is indicated by letter 'A' on the plan 
Exhibit 'E', having an area of 2,076 square meters; and that the portion 
indicated by letter 'B' with an area of 1,838 square meters was not claimed by 
the defendants.</p>
<p>'Defendants' evidence also shows that before the cadastral survey of Lot No. 
4700 in 1912, according to Hermogenes Enriquez, said lot consisted of two 
parcels of land, independent from each other, which are parcels 'A' and 'B' 
mentioned above. Parcel 'A' was purchased by Teodoro Rago from Mariano Abella, 
while parcel 'B' was acquired frdan Sor Damiana Veloso. And during the cadastral 
survey, these parcels were consolidated into ajsingle lot which is Lot No. 4700, 
as they are contiguous to each other and belonged to one person. In 1917, 
according to Ponciana Rago, her father donated parcel 'A' to her in 
consideration of marriage, where she built a residential house which was rebuilt 
later on (Exh. '8-A') and until now it is still existing thereon. No deed of 
donation was, however, presented, the same having been allegedly lost during the 
war. In 1920, Ponciana Rago planted about twenty-five coconut trees on this 
parcel of land, some of which serve as boundary line between parcels 'A' and 
'B'.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, plaintiffs contend that the whole lot No. 4700 was 
adjudicated to their deceased father Ciriaco Rago pursuant to the deed of 
partition (Exh. 'A') which claim was confirmed by the lower court on July 29, 
1941, and lately on January 19, 1946."</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears that Lot No. 4700, now in litigation, originally belonged to the 
deceased spouses Teodoro Rago and Macaria Gabuya and was registered in their 
names. On October 28, 1919, said spouses executed a deed of partition wherein 
they divided their properties among their children. On October 23, 1940, Ciriaco 
Rago, one of the children, filed a motion in the cadastral case "No. 13, 
G.L.R.O. Record 9469" asking for the cancellation of the Original Certificate of 
Title No. 3338 covering Lot No. 4700 which was issued in the name of the spouses 
Teodoro Rago and Macaria Gabuya and for the issuance in lieu thereof of a new 
certificate of title in the name of the mova4t, on the ground that said lot was 
adjudicated to him in the extra-judicial partition. Acting on said motion, the 
court issued on July 29, 1941 an order granting the same. Later, on August 28, 
1941, Attys. Hipolito Alo and Filiberto Leonardo, in representation of Fortunata 
Rago, Filemon Rago and Ponciana Rago filed in turn a motion asking for the 
reconsideration of said order far the reason that the parcel of land that was 
adjudicated iji favor of Ciriaco Rago by virtue of the deed of partition was 
only a portion of Lot No. 4700 and not the entire lot.This motion was denied in 
an order of September 6, 1941. September 17, the aforesaid counsel appealed from 
said order and, after the approval of the record on appeal, the same was 
elevated to the Court of Appeals, but the appeal was later dismissed on the 
ground of abandonment or lack of interest on the part of appellants. Ciriaco 
Rago died on June 21, 1945, and on November 12, 1945, his son, Francisco Rago, 
filed a motion in the same cadastral case praying that the Original Certificate 
of Title No. 3338 be cancelled and that a new one be issued in favor of the 
children of the late Ciriaco Rago. This motion was granted in an order issued on 
January 19, 1946, but, apparently, no title in the names of said heirs has as 
yet been issued pursuant to the aforesaid order. </p>
<p>One of the issues raised on which the Court of Appeals laid stress in 
deciding the case in favpr of respondents refers to the order of the cadastral 
court issued on July 29, 1941 which granted the motion of Ciriaco Rago that 
Original Certificate of Title No. 3338 covering Lot No. 47OO which was issued in 
the name of his deceased parents be cancelled and a new one issued in his name 
on the ground that Lot No. 4700 has been adjudicated to him in the 
extra-judicial partition executed by said parents among their children. It was 
contended that said order was null and void and without any legal, effect 
because the movant failed to give the required notice to the adverse parties, 
especially to Ponciana Rago, and as such said motion was but a mere piece of 
paper which could not confer jurisdiction upon the cadastral court. This 
contention was brushed aside by the Court of Appeals and this is now assigned as 
error.</p>
<p>While it appears that of the motion filed by Ciriaco Rago as above adverted 
to no notice was given to the adverse parties, however, it likewise appears that 
the court, upon granting said motion, ordered that said adverse parties, among 
them, Fortunata Rago, Ponciana Rago and Filemon Rago, be notified of its order 
of July 29, 1941, which granted the motion, and the record shows that they were 
accordingly notified thereof so much so that, within the statutory period, the 
sane persons, through their counsel, filed a motion for the reconsideration of 
said order. It further appears that when this motion for reconsideration was 
denied, the movants appealed from the order of denial to the Court of Appeals 
but, unfortunately, the appeal was dismissed on the ground of abandonment or 
lack of interest on the part of appellants. Consequently, the order became final 
and executory and became binding upon the petitioners. Had they not abandoned 
their appeal perhaps they would have been able to obtain relief from what they 
claimed was a procedural defect, but they failed. The Court of Appeals did not 
therefore err in setting up the doctrine of res adjudicata against them. .</p>
<p>Petitioners, as children of Ponciana Rago, contend that even supposing that 
she was duly represented when the motion for reconsideration was filed to 
dispute the order of July 29, 1941, still the cadastral court could not have 
acquired jurisdiction over the motion filed by Ciriaco Rago in view of the fact 
that, Lot No. 4700 being in dispute, the motion became controversial and cannot 
be looked into by a cadastral court, but that the same should be litigated in an 
ordinary civil action, for the reason that under Section 112 of Act No. 496, 
cadastral proceedings are summary in nature. VJhile a cadastral court, under 
section 112, has no jurisdiction to act on a motion which involves a 
controversial question of ownership, the claim of petitioners has no factual 
basis, since it does not appear that Ponciana Rago, their 
predecessor-in-interest, has impugned the jurisdiction of the court on that 
ground. Apparently, the cadastral court acted on the motion having in mind the 
doctrine laid down in the case of Government of P. I. v. Serafica, 61 Phil., 93, 
wherein this Court held that "when the land registered under either of the two 
systems x x x is subdivided by the new owners or co-heirs, and they file a 
petition in accordance with Section 112 of Act No. 496 for the cancellation of 
the old certificate of title and the issuance of new certificates corresponding 
to the portions into which the land has been subdivided, these petitioners are 
entitled to the remedy invoked by them without the necessity of a previous 
declaration of heirs nor of the institution of intestate proceedings of the 
original owners thereof who have died." The facts covered by the motion of 
Ciriaco Rago come within the purview of this doctrine.</p>
<p>It is indeed intriguing why the cadastral court did not entertain the motion 
for reconsideration if it is true that the movants set forth good reasons 
showing that the order of the court was issued on a fraudulent representation 
made by Ciriaco Rago. But the record furnishes some clues that may serve to 
justify the action taken by the court. Thus, according to the Court of Appeals, 
said motion did not allege the ground now invoked that the court was without 
jurisdiction to entertain the motion. Neither did they allege that a portion of 
the land claimed by Ciriaco Rago was donated to'ponciana Rago by her father in 
consideration of her first marriage, as her heirs now claim, but it was alleged 
instead that it belonged to the other heirs of the deceased spouses. The motion 
may have been predicated mainly on the fact 'that there was lack of notice of 
the motion of Ciriaco Rago and that it was merely a piece of paper,, which the 
court must have considered trivial considering that substantially they had been 
notified of said motion by order of the court. If such was the only ground On 
which said motion was predicated, the court cannot be blamed for having 
disregarded it.</p>
<p>The remaining question to be considered is that involved in the third and 
fourth assignments of error which refers to the action of the Court of Appeals 
in granting to counsel for respondents two extensions of time within which to 
submit his brief, one for 30 days, and another for 15 days, which, it is 
claimed, is in violation of its own resolution entered on June 275 1951 and of 
Section 13, Article VII, of our Constitution, which confers upon the Supreme 
Court the exclusive power to promulgate rules of court.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Court of Appeals promulgated on June 27, 1951 a resolution of the 
following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court RESOLVED that as a matter of policy only one (1) extension of not 
more than thirty (30) days for the filing of briefs should be allowed: Provided, 
however, that proper publicity be given this policy, and during the first months 
of its enforcement parties or their counsel should be informed 
thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>while, on the other hand, the same court granted counsel for respondents a 
total period of forty-five (45) days within which to submit his brief, for which 
reason counsel for petitioners interposed a vigorous objection to such extension 
and moveifor the dismissal of the appeal, but the court, making use of its 
discretion, ignored the opposition and denied the motion to dismiss. Does this 
constitute an abuse of discretion?</p>
<p>Under Section 16, Rule 48, extensions of time for the filing of briefs are 
not generally allowed, except for good and sufficient cause. This rule applied 
both to the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. This rule provides that 
extensions of time for the filing of briefs may be given for good and sufficient 
cause, which indicates that the court may grant as many extensions as may be 
asked if good reasons are shown. While the Court of Appeals adopted as a matter 
of policy that only one extension of not more than thirty days would be allowed 
for the filing of briefs, that cannot be considered as mandatory. It being 
merely directory, its application can be liberalized when circumstances so 
warrant. As it appears that the Court of Appeals has not roade an improper use 
of its discretion, we hold that the errors assigned are not well taken.</p>
<p>Finding no error in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed, 
without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and Reyes, 
<em>J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
