				<H3>[With resolution of December 29, 1960]<br><br>IN RE: PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP, ANDRES ONG KHAN, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by the Government from a decision of the Court of 
First Instance of Laguna granting the petition of Andres Ong Khan to be admitted 
a citizen of the Philippines.
<p>On December 18, 1957, Andres Ong Khan applied for Philippine citizenship. 
After the publication of his petition and the notice of hearing as required by 
section 9 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473, as 
amended), the provincial fiscal of Laguna, representing the Solicitor General, 
registered an opposition on the ground that there was no showing in the petition 
that the petitioner has complied with section 5 of the Act, nor was there any 
allegation to the effect that he was exempt from such requirement. In reply, the 
petitioner reasoned out that he should be considered exempt from making a 
declaration of intention because he was born in the Philippines and has received 
his elementary and secondary education in schools recognized by the Philippine 
Government. Upon his request and with prior leave of court, the petitioner filed 
an amended petition, incorporating the allegation that he is exempt from filing 
a declaration of intention, including the reason's for such exemption.</p>
<p>When the case was called for hearing, the fiscal objected to the presentation 
of evidence in support of the petition on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on 
the part of the court to try the case, unless and until the petition, as 
amended, is published anew in accordance with the requirements of the law. It 
was argued, however, in behalf of the petitioner, that a republication was not 
necessary since the amendment refers merely to form and not to substance. 
Upholding the contention, the lower court allowed the petitioner to present his 
evidence, and after hearing, rendered judgment granting the petition for 
naturalization. From that decision, the Solicitor General appealed.</p>
<p>The appeal is well taken.</p>
<p>Section 7 of the Revised Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473, as 
amended) enumerates what should be set forth in a petition for naturalization. 
Among others, it requires that the petition must contain a statement that the 
applicant has complied with the requirements of section 5 of the Act which 
enjoins the said applicant to file with the office of the Solicitor General, one 
year prior to the filing of his petition for naturalization, a declaration under 
oath that it is his <em>bona fide</em> intention to become a citizen of the 
Philippines. It also requires that the declaration be made part of the petition. 
The filing of such declaration of intention is mandatory and an absolute 
pre-requisite to naturalization. Failure to file the same, unless exempted under 
section 6, is fatal to the application for naturalization. (Yu Yap <em>vs</em>. 
Republic, G. R. No. L-4270, May 8, 1952; Yu <em>vs</em>. Republic, 92 Phil., 
804; and Tan <em>vs</em>. Republic, 94 Phil. 882.) Under the said section 6, in 
order that an applicant may be entitled to exemption from filing a declaration 
of intention, either of the following two conditions must exist: (1) that the 
applicant was born in the Philippines and has received his primary and secondary 
education in public schools or those recognized by the Government and not 
limited to any race or nationality; or (2) that he has resided continuously in 
the Philippines for a period of thirty years or more before filing his 
application. To such requirements shall be added that which establishes that the 
applicant has given primary and secondary education to all his children in the 
public schools or in private schools recognized by the Government and not 
limited to any race or nationality (<em>See</em> Commonwealth Act No. 535); that 
is, if the applicant's children, if any, are already of school age (Chan Tiao 
<em>vs</em>. Republic, 95 Phil., 709).</p>
<p>In the present case, the petitioner made no allegation in his original 
petition that he has complied with section 5 of the Revised Naturalization Law. 
No declaration of intention was attached, to his petition. He did not claim 
exemption from filing such declaration of intention under section 6 of the said 
law, and neither did he make any allegation of facts that would entitle him to 
exemption. Thus, being less than 25 years at the time of the filing of his 
petition, he never claimed continuous residence in the Philippines for 30 years 
or more. He did allege that he was born here but, certainly, that statement 
alone cannot serve as a claim for exemption. It would have been otherwise had 
petitioner also alleged, in addition, that he had finished his elementary and 
secondary education in schools recognized by the Government. In cases where the 
petitioner is exempt from filing a declaration of intention, a statement as to 
his exemption and the reasons therefor should appear in the petition, in order 
to apprise the public, especially those officers charged with notice of the 
application, of the reasons advanced in support of the claim for exemption, so 
that they may be prepared, if legally proper and necessary, to contest or object 
to any evidence adduced on that regard. The failure, therefore, of the 
petitioner in this case to make a statement in his petition about His having 
filed, or his being exempt from filing, a declaration of intention constituted a 
fatal defect "in his petition and rendered the same void, for non-compliance 
with the provisions of law relative to the contents of, and annexes to, fhe 
petition for naturalization. (In re Robert Cu, 89 Phil., 473; Pidelo 
<em>vs</em>. Republic, 97 Phil., 632.)</p>
<p>Of course, as already stated, petitioner amended his petition by 
incorporating the allegation that he is exempt from filing a declaration of 
intention and alleging hi3 reasons therefore. The petition, as amended, however, 
was not published. The original petition being void in that it lacked some 
essential particular, the amended petition should have been treated as a new one 
and published in accordance with sectkm 9 of the Revised Naturalization Law.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the petition for naturalization is hereby denied, 
without prejudice. So ordered, without costs. '</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. 
L., Barrera</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur. </p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed</em>.</p>

<p><strong>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Petitioner Andres Ong Khan has filed a motion for reconsideration of the 
decision promulgated on October 28, 1960, denying his application for 
naturalization, without prejudice, for the reasons that he did not comply with 
the provisions of law relative to the contents of a petition for naturalization 
and that while he subsequently amended his petition to supply the deficiency, 
the same was not published.</p>
<p>Before action could be taken on the aforesaid motion, petitioner filed 
another motion praying that the case be returned to the trial court and that he 
be permitted to comply at once with the required publication of his amended 
petition without the necessity of filing a new application.</p>
<p>Considering the arguments advanced in support of the motion for 
reconsideration, we find and so hold that the same are without merit. Said 
motion must, therefore, be as it is hereby, denied.</p>
<p>We are, however inclined to grant petitioner's other motion to remand the 
case to the trial court in order to avoid the necessity of filing a new 
application and the repetition of proceedings already had. This is with the 
understanding, of course, that the parties, especially the Government, shall be 
given additional or new opportunity to establish or disprove the existence of 
circumstances as would justify the grant of naturalization. For this purpose the 
dispositive portion of our decision is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, the case is ordered remanded to the court of 
origin and that court, after due publication of the amended petition as required 
by law, is hereby instructed to give the parties additional or new opportunity 
to be heard." So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Paredes</em> and 
<em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Dispositive portion of Supreme Courts' decision amended; case remanded to 
court of origin.</em></p></div>
