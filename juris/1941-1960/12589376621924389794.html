				<H3>FLORENTINO NAVARRO AND BEATRIZ VINOYA, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. ELOY BELLO, JUDGE OF THE  COURT  OF  FIRST  INSTANCE  OF PANGASINAN,  JUAN  CABUANG,  FLORENTINA BAUTISTA, FLORENCIO GALICIA  AND CONSOLACION BAUTISTA,  RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition  for  certiorari and mandamus  with preliminary injunction seeking the annulment of a decision of the  Court of First Instance of Pangasinan dated  July 30,  1956,  dismissing  the complaint  in Civil  Case  No. 13099,  adjudging  the  respondents-defendants  owners  of two parcels of land described in the complaint, and awarding damages to the latter for the unlawful usurpation  of the disputed lots by the petitioners. <br><br>It appears that the petitioners-plaintiffs filed a complaint on September 30, 1954, with the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan  (Civil Case No.  13099)  praying for the annulment of transfer certificates of title Nos. 15967 and 15968 and  the  corresponding deeds of  sale executed  by respondents  Florencio  Galicia  and  Consolacion  Bautista in favor of respondents  Juan  Cabuang and  Florentino Bautista  over lots Nos.  20774  and  32540, of  the  San Carlos  Cadastre,  claiming ownership  of said  parcels  of land, and alleging actual possession.   Respondents filed their answer to the amended complaint on November 24, 1954, also claiming  ownership over the questioned lots, with a  counterclaim for  damages allegedly arising out of the unlawful usurpation of possession of the above described  parcels  of land  by the petitioners through  force and intimidation. <br><br>No answer to the counterclaim  having been filed within the  time prescribed  by the Rules, upon petition of the respondents, the petitioners (plaintiffs below)  were declared in  default in  an  order of  the  lower court dated February 2,  1955,  and  the same  order commissioned the deputy  clerk  of  court  to receive the  evidence  of the defendants.   No  notice  of this order was furnished the petitioners or their  counsel.   The reception of  evidence was made on February 8, 1955,  and in  accordance with the evidence submitted by the respondents, the  court rendered decision adjudicating the  defendants' counterclaim for  damages,  declaring the  respondents owners  of the disputed parcels  of land,  and dismissing the  complaint. Copy of the  decision was received by  the  petitioners on August  7, 1956. <br><br>On September 3,  1956, petitioners filed their first motion for reconsideration  to  set aside  the  decision  and  order of default; it was denied, and notice of such denial received by the petitioners on October 1, 1956.  A second motion for reconsideration filed on October 3, 1956,  having been also denied by  the lower court, notice of  appeal  was filed by petitioners on October 5,  1956, the same day  when  the notice of denial of the second motion for reconsideration was received by them, and with the notice of appeal they asked for a fifteen-day extension within  which to file  the record on  appeal  and  appeal  bond, which  was granted. But upon objection interposed by the respondents, the court in its order of October 26,  1956, denied the approval of the record on  appeal on the ground that the decision sought to be  reviewed  has become final and that  the plaintiffs having been  declared in  default, they have no  right to appeal unless and until the order of default is revoked and set aside. <br><br>There was no need for petitioners to answer respondents' counterclaim, considering that plaintiffs, in their complaint, claimed  not  only ownership of, but  also  the right to possess,  the  parcels  in question, alleging that  sometime in May,  1954, defendants,  through force and intimidation, wrested  possession thereof from their tenants, and that it was upon  a writ of possession issued  by the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan that they were placed back in possession by the provincial sheriff.   These averments were  denied by  defendants in their answer, wherein they asserted ownership  in themselves  and illegal  deprivation of  their possession  by plaintiffs,  and  as  counterclaim, prayed for damages allegedly suffered because of plaintiffs' alleged usurpation of the premises. <br><br>It thus appears that the issues of the  counterclaim are the very issues raised in  the  complaint  and in the answer, and said counterclaim is based on the very defenses pleaded  in the  answer.   To answer  such  counterclaim would  require plaintiffs to  replead the same facts already alleged in their  complaint. <br><br>But in any event, whether or not plaintiffs have answered defendants' counterclaim, they have  the  right to  prove the  averments  of their  complaint, including their  claim that it was  by court order that they secured possession of the parcels in question from defendants.   And if  plaintiffs are  able  to  prove  such  allegations,  then  the  court must dismiss defendants' counterclaim for damages, since the illegal usurpation of defendants'  possession  allegedly committed by plaintiffs, which is the basis of the counter-claim, would not have been proved.   In short, the  issues of the counterclaim are so inseparable from those of the complaint and  the  answer  that  such counterclaim partakes of the nature of a special defense which, even  if not specifically challenged by plaintiffs in a  reply, is deemed controverted (Rule 11, sec. 1, Rules of Court; Rosario <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. J. Martinez, 92 Phil., 1064; Luna <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Apacible, 79  Phil., 8).  There was, therefore, no occasion for plaintiffs' default on  defendants' counterclaim, and the  order of  the court  below declaring them in default,  as well as  the judgment by default, is  improper and void. <br><br>It is plain from the records that the complaint and the answer have not  as yet been set for trial  in  the  court below.  Only  after  the issues of the complaint and  answer are tried, and  the parties  heard,  may the  court resolve the defendants' counterclaim for damages.  If the court finds for plaintiffs, defendants' defenses, and counter-claim,  must necessarily fail.   On the other  hand,  if  the court finds for  the  defendants, then plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed,  defendants would  be declared owners of the lands in question, and they would be awarded damages under their counterclaim.  But until  and  unless  the whole  case is heard on the merits, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> can not decide on  defendants'  counterclaim, without  depriving plaintiffs their day in court. <br><br>Even if plaintiffs had  really defaulted  on the  counter-claim,  still the  court was bound  to limit  its decision to the specific reliefs ask for.  Sec.  9, Rule 35, of the Rules of Court provides: <br><blockquote>"A judgment entered by default shall not exceed the  amount or be different in  kind from  that prayed for in  the demand for judgment * * *." </blockquote>Since  the counterclaim  was  set to <span style="font-style: italic;">recover  damages</span> caused  by the petitioners alleged  entering the land  in question through force and intimidation, the court could, at most,  award  the damages sought;  hence, in adjudging  also  the  defendants,  Juan  Cabuang and Florentina Bautista, to be  the  owners of  the two parcels of  land described in the  complaint, when what  was tried was the counterclaim, the court below exceeded its jurisdiction (See Lim Toco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Fo  Fay, 80 Phil., 166). <br><br>Since  the  ownership of the disputed land was  put  in issue by the allegations of the complaint and the  special defenses in the  answer, the correct procedure, assuming that the declaration of  default was  properly  entered, should have been for the trial court to set  the complaint and  answer  for  hearing.  The lower court, even  in the case of  a true  default on the  counterclaim, could not deny the petitioners-plaintiffs  the right to  be heard and produce  evidence in  support  of their  complaint, as  that pleading was valid  and had  not been stricken  from the records.   Their having defaulted on the counterclaim,  if they did so at all, did not  operate to deprive the plaintiffs from any standing  or remedy in court in connection with their complaint. <br><br>Petitioners' timely motions for  reconsideration and new trial were denied by  the lower court, first, because  it said the petitioners had  lost their  standing in  court in view of the  order of default,  and second because such motions were not accompanied by  affidavits of  merits.  The first argument  is,  in  view of  what  we have already  stated, invalid and untenable. As for the second, we have already ruled that affidavits of merits  are not necessary  when the granting of the motion is not discretionary with the court but is demandable as of right, as  where the movant has been deprived of his day in  court, through no  fault or  negligence of  his own  (Valerio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Tan, et  al.,  97 Phil. 558).   This rule applies in the instant case, since petitioners have  been deprived of their day in  court through an illegal  order of  default. <br><br>Wherefore, the writ  of  certiorari is granted, and the decision of July  30, 1956 of the  Court of First Instance of  Pangasinan in its case No. 13099 is hereby set aside, and said court is directed  to  proceed  with the trial of the entire case on the merits.   Costs against respondents Cabuang and Bautista.  So ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,  Concepcion,  Endencia,</span>  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix,  JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br></div>
