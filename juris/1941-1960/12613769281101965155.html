				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an appeal by&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; from an&nbsp; order of the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Batangas, dismissing the complaint,&nbsp; upon motion of the defendants, on&nbsp; the ground that the cause&nbsp; of action&nbsp; was barred&nbsp; by the statute of limitations. <br><br>The complaint was filed on December 6, 1954 and recited that Mariano Rodriguez Varela, appellant's&nbsp; brother, died intestate in Batangas, Batangas, on September 5,&nbsp; 1940 and left&nbsp; an estate worth P45.000 which was&nbsp; settled in&nbsp; a written agreement&nbsp; among the heirs dated February&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1941&nbsp; and duly approved by the court on April 7, 1941.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said agreement provided that Carmelo&nbsp; Bautista, also known as Carmelo Varela (father of appellees) was the acknowledged natural child of the deceased Mariano E.&nbsp; Varela; that the appellant, who had&nbsp; long been absent and unheard&nbsp; from, would be given a share equivalent to P12,000 which Carmelo Bautista would satisfy in money or property&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the appearance&nbsp; of the appellant. The latter&nbsp; seeks to recover said amount from&nbsp; the appellees&nbsp; who,&nbsp; as successors&nbsp; of Carmelo Bautista, allegedly refused and have still refused to pay the same. <br><br>The lower court&nbsp; ruled that more&nbsp; than ten years had elapsed since accrual&nbsp; of&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; cause of action on April 7, 1941 when the agreement in question was&nbsp; approved by the court and that, for purposes of prescription, appellant's knowledge or lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; knowledge of his right was immaterial.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; was a plain error consequent&nbsp; upon the wrong supposition&nbsp; that the&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; action&nbsp; accrued on April 7, 1941.&nbsp; The agreement&nbsp; provided that&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P12,000&nbsp; would be paid to the appellant upon his&nbsp; appearance, and no period was fixed for said purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; denied that the appellant was unaware&nbsp; of the&nbsp; arrangement until he returned to the Philippines from&nbsp; the United States in November,&nbsp; 1945, when upon his&nbsp; appearance the obligor&nbsp; had failed to comply&nbsp; with his covenant. Hence appellant's right to sue started&nbsp; only from the moment he presented&nbsp; himself and was not paid.&nbsp; It would be absurd to&nbsp; expect&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant to&nbsp; so present&nbsp; himself without in the first&nbsp; place knowing the&nbsp; existence of&nbsp; the obligation in his favor.&nbsp; The situation may be likened to an indebtedness evidenced by a written document,&nbsp; payable within&nbsp; a stated&nbsp; period, where the cause of action would accrue&nbsp; only&nbsp; upon the expiration of the stipulated period in case payment is&nbsp; not&nbsp; made,â€”certainly&nbsp; not&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement. It&nbsp; would&nbsp; make no&nbsp; difference whether appellant's right be based on the agreement&nbsp; of February 14, 1941 or on the order of&nbsp; the court on April 7, 1841, because&nbsp; the&nbsp; result would be&nbsp; the same;&nbsp; namely, that the obligation&nbsp; would be deemed to mature upon&nbsp; the appearance of the appellant.&nbsp; Let it be noted that the order of April 7, did not change the terms of the agreement of&nbsp; February&nbsp; 14. <br><br>Wherefore, the appealed order is reversed and the case remanded to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> for further proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered, with costs&nbsp; against the appellees. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></div>
