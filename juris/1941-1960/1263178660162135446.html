				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal taken by plaintiff Maria B. Castro, from the decision
of the Court of First Instance of Laguna (in Civil Case No. 9828),
dismissing her case for lack of appellate jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the action, and ordering her to return to defendant Geronimo
de los Reyes, the possession of 2 parcels of land covered by Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. T-953 and T-954, and to account to the
latter for the income she received therefrom during the period she was
in possession thereof, and to pay the costs.
  <p> The records
disclose that on January 24, 1945, shortly before liberation, defendant
filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against
plaintiff and her husband, Manuel B. Espinosa, seeking a declaration by
the court that the contract entered into by and between him and
plaintiff and her husband on August 31, 1943 involving 2 parcels of
coconut land located at Calauan, Laguna, containing an area of 246
hectares and described in Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 8254 and
8255 of the Register of Deeds of Laguna, denominated as "Contract of
Sale with Right to Repurchase", was merely a contract of simple
mortgage to guarantee the payment of an obligation, and that the other
contract entitled "Contract of Lease" executed on the same date by the
same parties and involving the same parcels of land, was executed
merely to evidence the obligation to pay interest on the principal loan
of P120,000.00 at the stipulated rate of 6% per annum. Said complaint
was docketed as Civil Case No. 3134 in said court and entitled
"Geronimo de los Reyes <i>vs.</i> Maria B. Castro and Manuel B. Espinosa."</p>
  <p>
Simultaneous with the filing of said case, defendant deposited with the
clerk of court, in consignation for the benefit of plaintiff and her
husband, the amount of P120,182.50, due notice of which was given to
said spouses.</p>
  <p> On September 30, 1947, while said Civil Case
No. 3134 was still pending, plaintiff executed an affidavit of
consolidation of ownership over said 2 parcels of land, and caused the
same to be registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Laguna,
without the knowledge and consent of defendant. On the strength of said
affidavit, Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 8254 and 8255 were
cancelled and in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.
T-953 and T-954, both in the name of plaintiff, married to Manuel B.
Espinosa, were issued.</p>
  <p> Upon discovery of said consolidation
of ownership by plaintiff, defendant on October 9, 1947, filed a
petition with the Court of First Instance of Manila praying for the
reconstitution of the records of said Civil Case No. 3134 which were
destroyed during the battle for liberation of the City of Manila in
February and March of 1945. Said petition was, however, denied by the
court on the ground that it was not filed on time. Defendant,
thereupon, filed with the same court on October 28, 1947, a complaint
against plaintiff and her husband, embodying the same allegations and
prayer contained in the complaint filed in said Civil Case No. 3134.
The new complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 3910.</p>
  <p> In
the meantime, or on October 25, 1947, plaintiff, acting alone and
without joining her husband, filed with the Justice of the Peace Court
of Calauan, Laguna, a complaint for unlawful detainer (Civil Case No.
3), seeking to eject defendant from said 2 parcels of land. Plaintiff
alleged that on August 31, 1943, defendant leased from her said parcels
of land for a period of 4 years, and the latter failed to pay the
yearly rental of P7,200.00 beginning August 31, 1945. To this
complaint, defendant filed his answer, alleging as affirmative and
special defenses, the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"A. That
the plaintiff Maria B. Castro is not the owner nor is entitled to the
possession of the property involved in the 'suit for the reason that
the contract, styled 'Deed of Sale With Right to Repurchase' under
which she claims right to said property was one of mortgage to
guarantee the payment of the obligation of P120,000.00, Japanese
military notes and the 'Contract of Lease' merely evidenced the payment
of the stipulated annual interest on the principal indebtedness of
P120,000.00 at the rate of 6% per annum;</p>
    <p> "B. That in view
of the fact that the question of possession cannot be properly
determined by the Justice of the Peace without first settling the
question of ownership, said Justice of the Peace without jurisdiction
over the subject matter of the action;</p>
    <p> "C. That there is a
pending action between the same parties involving the same subject
matter namely, Civil Case No. 3134 as reconstructed by Civil Case No.
3910, both of the Court of First Instance of Manila; and </p>
    <p>"D.
That, furthermore, Maria B. Castro has no legal capacity to institute
the action without joining her husband, Manuel B. Espinosa."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Simultaneous, with the filing of his answer, defendant filed a petition
for preliminary hearing on the affirmative defenses averred in his
answer, especially in respect of the defense that the question of
ownership must have to be decided before the question of possession may
be determined. The Justice of the Peace Court of Calauan, then presided
by Hon. Artemio Elepaño, denied said petition] and ordered the trial of
the case. Thereupon, defendant filed with us a petition for certiorari
(G. R. No. L-1823), assailing the jurisdiction of said court to try the
case on the merits. Denying said petition, we said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"There
is a long line of decisions of this Court holding that the mere fact
that the defendant, in his answer, claims to be the owner of the
property from which the plaintiff seeks to eject him, is not sufficient
to divest the Justice of the Peace or the Municipal Court of its
summary jurisdiction in actions for forcible entry and detainer,
because, were the principle otherwise, the ends of justice would be
frustrated by making the efficacy of this land of action depend upon
the defendant in all cases. Exceptions may be made when the evidence
during the trial in said court shows that the question of title is
actually involved and that the defendant's contention, according to
said evidence, is meritorious. (Supia and Batiaco <i>vs.</i> Quintero and Ayala, 59 Phil., 312, 321; Aquino <i>vs.</i> Deala, 63 Phil., 582, 593; Torres <i>vs.</i> Pena, et al., 78 Phil., 231; Penalosa, et al. <i>vs.</i> Garcia, et al., 78 Phil., 245; Zapanta <i>vs.</i>
Bartolome and Chan-Liongco, 83 Phil, 433). So much depends upon the
merit or lack of merit in the claim or contention of Geronimo about his
ownership of the land—this, to be determined during the trial in the
Justice of the Peace Court." (De los Reyes <i>vs.</i> Elepaño, 83 Phil., 961; 46 Off- Gaz., [11] 143.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Thereafter, the case was tried on the merits by the Justice of the
Peace Court of Calauan. After closing his evidence, defendant
reiterated his assault upon the court's jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the action. Notwithstanding said objections, the court
declared itself with jurisdiction and rendered a decision, the
dispositive part of which, reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"In view
of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the
plaintiff and orders the defendant to vacate the premises and to pay
the plaintiff the sum of P7,200.00 a year from August 31, 1945 until he
vacates the same; and to pay attorney's fees to the plaintiff in the
sum of P1,000.00 and also the costs of this action."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of said decision but the
same was denied. He then filed with us a petition for certiorari (G. R.
No. L-3466) assailing the authority of the Justice of the Peace of
Calauan to pass upon the case on its merits and render judgment
thereon. We denied said petition, stating:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The
only question to decide in the present case is, may the finding of fact
of the justice of the peace to the effect that the defendant's claim of
ownership is devoid of merit be reviewed by this Court on certiorari to
determine whether or not the justice of the peace court had
jurisdiction to decide the case. In the first place, the oral evidence
adduced before the justice of the peace court is not and cannot be
brought before us, said court not being a court of record. In the
second place, the extraordinary remedy of certiorari does not lie
because the judgment rendered in this case by the justice of the peace
is appealable to the Court of First Instance." (De los Reyes <i>vs.</i> Elepaño, et al., 93 Phil., 239.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Immediately thereafter, defendant within the reglementary period,
perfected his appeal from the decision of the Justice of the Peace
Court of Calauan to the Court of First Instance of Laguna. The Justice
of the Peace, however, refused to give due course to the appeal, as a
consequence of which, defendant was compelled to file with the Court of
First Instance of Laguna a petition for mandamus (Civil Case No. 9355),
to compel the Justice of the Peace to give due course to said appeal.
Plaintiff then filed a motion to dismiss the petition, on the ground
that the appeal was filed out of time, but the same was denied by the
Court of First Instance. Plaintiff, therefore, filed with us a petition
for prohibition and certiorari with preliminary injunction (G. R. No.
L-4889). We denied said petition for lack of merit (Res. of July 9,
1951.)</p>
  <p> In due time, the mandamus case before the Court of
First Instance of Laguna (Civil Case No. 9395) was finally decided
granting the petition and directing the Justice of the Peace of Calauan
to give due course to defendant's appeal. From said decision, plaintiff
appealed directly to us (G. R. No. L-5282). We affirmed the decision of
the Court of First Instance of Laguna stating that "under the
circumstances of this case, the notice of appeal of appellant (De los
Reyes) was filed in due time and that the decision of the Justice of
the Peace had not yet become final and executory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
As a result of our said decision defendant's appeal from the decision
of the Justice of the Peace of Calauan was perfected in the Court of
First Instance of Laguna, and docketed in the latter court s Civil Case
No. 9828.</p>
  <p> On November 12, 1954, plaintiff filed 2 motions in
said Civil Case No. 9828 namely, (1) a motion for immediate execution,
and (2) a motion to dismiss the appeal and to declare judgment final.
The first motion prayed that the judgment of the Justice of the Peace
Court be immediately executed, pursuant to Section 8, Rule 72, of the
Rules of Court, while the second motion sought to have the decision of
the same court declared final and the appeal dismissed, for not having
been perfected in accordance with Sections 2 and 3, Rule 40, of the
same Rules.</p>
  <p> On November 16, 1954, defendant filed a motion,
praying that the appealed case (Civil Case No. 9828) be dismissed, on
the ground that the Court of First Instance of Laguna had ceased to
have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the litigation, upon the
enactment of Republic Act No. 1199.</p>
  <p> On January 20, 1955, the
court, issued an order denying plaintiff's first motion, i.e., to
dismiss the appeal and to declare judgment final. From this order of
denial, plaintiff did not appeal, or elevate the matter on certiorari
before the proper appellate court. On the same date, the court,
likewise, denied defendant's motion to dismiss the case. Whereupon,
defendant filed his opposition to plaintiff's motion for immediate
execution.</p>
  <p> When plaintiff's second motion namely, for
immediate execution, was called for hearing on March 1, 1955, the trial
court issued an order giving defendant 15 days from said date, within
which to effect an amicable settlement of the case. Upon the expiration
of the said period on March 16, 1955, the court immediately issued an
order granting plaintiff's motion for immediate execution. And, on the
same date, the Provincial Sheriff placed plaintiff in possession of the
land in question (see Motion for Immediate Execution, pp. 251 and 252,
Record on Appeal).</p>
  <p> Notified of this order, defendant moved
for a reconsideration thereof, which was denied by the court.
Whereupon, defendant elevated the matter to us by certiorari (G. R. No.
L-8960). We forthwith issued a writ of preliminary injunction, and
after the parties had submitted their respective memoranda, we rendered
a decision on January 31, 1957, declaring null and void the order of
the trial court delivering possession, <i>pendente lite</i>, of the parcels of land in dispute, in this tenor:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"*
* * the provision for the immediate execution of a judgment of the
justice of the peace court in actions of unlawful detainer under
Section 8 of Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, is not applicable to an
action of detainer like the present, where there is no immediate
urgency for the execution because it is not justified by the
circumstances.</p>
    <p align="center">    * * * * *</p>
    <p>"*
* * inasmuch as the property now subject of litigation was originally
sold only with right to repurchase to the plaintiff, so that the
plaintiff was not really and originally the owner and possessor of the
property, and since there are reasonable grounds to believe that the
contract entered into between them was not one of lease but one of loan
with mortgage of the property, the right of the plaintiff to the
immediate possession of the property is not apparent; clear or
conclusive, and neither should his right to the immediate execution of
the property allowed until opportunity to settle the question of
ownership is had. In other words, * * * while section 8 of Rule 72 is
applicable also in cases of unlawful detainer, the immediate execution
it provides for may be availed of only if no question of title is
involved and the ownership and the right to the possession of the
property is an admitted fact. * * *." (De los Reyes <i>vs.</i> Castro, et al., 100 Phil.; 831; 53 Off. Gaz., [10] 3060).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Finally, on January 28, 1957, the trial court rendered a decision which, in pertinent part, reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">    * * * * * * *</p>
    <p>"<i>The
prejudicial question presented to this Court for determination hinges
on the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court to hear and
decide the unlawful detainer case in view of the challenge made on its
jurisdiction that the question of ownership of the property is
necessarily and actually involved in the litigation and so it is argued
that the right of possession could not properly be determined without
an adjudication of the title. Whether title is necessarily involved in
this action is a question of fact which can be determined only from the
evidence presented by both parties at the trial</i>. (Alviar <i>vs.</i> Pampolina, 84 Phil., 45; 46 Off. Gaz., 6057; De los Reyes <i>vs.</i> Elepaño, G. R. No. L-3466.)</p>
    <p>"<i>From
the evidence adduced by the parties it is clear that the plaintiff's
pretended right to the possession of the property in dispute ultimately
rests upon her claim of ownership which in turn is based upon a
purported contract of sale with right of repurchase</i>. While the
defendant admitted to have signed the said deed, he nevertheless
claimed that it was a simulation to hide a mortgage of obligation
providing1 for the payment of interest. If said contract was really a
sale subject to repurchase and as the defendant failed to exercise the
right of redemption, the plaintiff would already be the owner of the
property and as such entitled to its possession. On the other hand, if
the contract was as defendant claim, in fact a mere mortgage, then he
could not be ejected therefrom much less required to pay rentals. <i>In
the final analysis, this case therefore hinges on a question of
ownership and is for that reason not cognizable by the Justice of the
Peace Court</i> (Teodoro <i>vs.</i> Balatbat 94 Phil., 247; 50 Off. Gaz. No. 2 p. 601).</p>
    <p>    <i>Moreover,
the defendant has made out a prima facie case and established a
meritorious claim as may be gleaned from the following circumstances to
wit</i>: (1) the defendant remained in possession of the property after
he had allegedly sold it to, the plaintiff; (2) he further bound,
himself to pay the land taxes on the property; (3) the stipulated
annual rental is equivalent to 6% interest per annum computed on the
sum of P120,000.00; (4) the plaintiff retained part of the purchase
price in the sum of P14,400.00 representing the alleged rentals paid in
advance for two years and the 3% commission of Mr. Miranda; (5) the
defendant as early as January, 1945, had already filed an action in the
Court of First Instance of Manila to annul the alleged sale made by him
to plaintiff; and (6) the consideration for the sale of the property
was much below its true value especially. taking into consideration the
income that may be derived therefrom.</p>
    <p>"<i>The Justice of
the Peace Court of Calauan erred in passing upon the merits of the
respective contentions of the parties as its sole duty was to resolve
first the prejudicial question raised by the defendant—whether title to
the property is involved in the controversy. It had no authority to
pass upon and determine if the transaction between the plaintiff and
the defendant was in fact a sale with a right to repurchase or a loan
secured by real estate mortgage. Such controversy should be solved, not
in a summary proceeding of ejectment but in Civil Case No. 3910 of the
Court of First Instance of Manila</i>.</p>
    <p>"<i>From the
evidence adduced by the parties, the question of involved in the
unlawful detainer case cannot be properly determined without first
resolving the question of ownership of the parcels of land from which
the defendant is sought to be ejected and considering that the validity
and legal effect of the contracts executed by and between the parties
have been squarely put in issue in Civil Case No. 3910 of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, the Justice of the Peace Court of Calauan was
divested of jurisdiction and should have dismissed the case. It follows
that this Court had no appellate jurisdiction to entertain and decide
the case</i>.</p>
    <p>"Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered
dismissing the case for lack of appellate jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the action and the plaintiff is ordered to return to the
defendant the possession of the two parcels of land, now covered by
Transfer Certificates of Title No. T-953 and T-954 and to account to
the latter for the income she received therefrom during the period she
was in possession thereof. The plaintiff is further ordered to pay the
costs in both instances." (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
From this decision, plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, but
said court, in its resolution of January 7, 1969, certified the case to
us, on the ground that it involves a question of the jurisdiction of
the lower court.</p>
  <p> Plaintiff-Appellant claims that the lower
court erred in dismissing the case on the ground that it had no
appellate jurisdiction to decide the same.</p>
  <p> The claim is
devoid of merit. In contesting the jurisdiction of the Justice of the
Peace Court of Calauan (in Civil Case No. 3), defendant-appellee
presented evidence in said court to show that the question of
possession of the 2 parcels of land in question could not be decided
without first deciding the question of title thereof. This can be seen
from the very decision of said court which, in pertinent part, reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"From
the evidence presented by both parties, the following facts hare been
established: On August 31, 1943, the defendant sold to the plaintiff
the two parcels of land in question covered by Transfer Certificate of
Title Nos. 8254 and 8255 with the right to repurchase for the sum of
P120,000.00. In the deed of sale (Exh. A), it is expressly provided and
agreed upon by the parties that the defendant may repurchase the
properties within four (4) years from August 31, 1943 and 'said right
of redemption shall be exercised at any time during the period between
August 31, 1945 and August 31, 1947'. On the same date, August 31,
1943, a contract of lease was entered into between the parties, whereby
the defendant leased from the plaintiff these two parcels of land for a
period of four (4) years at a rental of P7,200.00 per annum, the
rentals for the period from August 31, 1943 up to and including August
31, 1945 having been paid in advance by the defendant herein (Exhs. B
and B-1). On September 30, 1957, upon previous notice made by the
plaintiff to the defendant to pay back rents and to leave the premises
due to the expiration of the contract of lease and failure to
repurchase within the agreed period (Exh. C), the plaintiff
consolidated the ownership of the two parcels of land and, in view of
which, the Register of Deeds of Laguna cancelled Transfer Certificates
of Title Nos. 8254 and 8255 in the name of the defendant and issued
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 953 and 954 in the name of the
plaintiff. The plaintiff also has paid the land taxes for-these
properties for the years 1946-1949 (Exhs. D and D-1).</p>
    <p>"<i>The
defendant tried to prove that the deed of sale with right to repurchase
(Exh. A) was not really a sale but a mortgage, such being the intention
of the parties</i>; that the right of redemption could be exercised any
time within four (4) years provided the annual interest on the mortgage
loan is regularly paid; and that he tried to pay the plaintiff the
amount of P120,000.00 in December, 1944 and January, 1945 and, because
of her refusal to accept payment, the defendant instituted Civil Case
No. 3134, in the Court of First Instance of Manila in January, 1945,
depositing and consigning at the same time the amount of P120,000.00
with the Clerk of Court under Official Receipt No. 0607565 (Exhs. 2, 3,
4, and 5). The defendant herein seeked to have the contract declared a
mere mortgage and to have it cancelled because of payment by virtue of
the deposit made." (Italics supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The
rule is well-settled that the defendant, in a case of forcible entry
and detainer in a justice of the peace court, may not divest said court
of its jurisdiction by merely claiming ownership of the property
involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In a long line
of decisions, however, we have repeatedly held that if it appears
during the trial that, by the nature of the proof presented, the
question of possession cannot be determined without settling that of
ownership, then the jurisdiction of said court is lost and the action
Should be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> So, it was held in one case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
that if the plaintiffs right to the possession of the property in
dispute ultimately rests upon his claim of ownership, which is based
upon a purported contract of sale with right of repurchase admittedly
signed by defendants but alleged by them to be a mere simulation to
cloak a mortgage obligation tainted with usury, in the final analysis,
the case hinges on a question of ownership and is, for that reason, not
cognizable by the justice of the peace court.</p>
  <p> For the
purpose solely of determining whether the Justice of the Peace Court
had jurisdiction to try the ejectment case, we are in full conformity
with the trial court in its finding that defendant's evidence has made
out a <i>prima facie</i> case and a meritorious claim that the
question of possession of the 2 parcels concerned could not be decided
without first determining title of the same, and that, therefore, the
Justice of the Peace of Calauan was divested of its jurisdiction, and
should have dismissed the case. It follows that the Court of First
Instance of Laguna had no appellate jurisdiction to decide the case
and, its order of dismissal or that ground, was, consequently proper
and justified.</p>
  <p> Furthermore, as correctly observed by the
lower court, the validity and legal effect of the contracts executed
between plaintiff and defendant have been squarely put in issue before
the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 3910 thereby
likewise divesting said Justice of the Peace Court of its jurisdiction;
over the latter case and, consequently, the trial court's appellate
jurisdiction thereon.</p>
  <p> Plaintiff-appellant next contends that
the lower court erred in issuing its order dated January 20, 1955
denying her motion to dismiss defendant's appeal (dated November 12,
1954), on the ground that it was filed beyond the period provided in
Section 2, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court.</p>
  <p>
Plaintiff-appellant moved for the dismissal of defendant-appellee's
appeal, on the ground that the judgment of the Justice of the Peace
Court of Calauan, had already become final, because the appellate court
docket fee and appeal bond were not filed within the reglementary
period. It was argued that the sending of 2 money orders for the
appellate court docket fee and appeal bond to the Justice of the Peace
of Calauan, together with the notice of appeal was not in substantial
compliance with Sections 2 and 3, Rule 40, of the Rules of Court,
because what is required to be filed with the Justice of the Peace
Court is the certificate of the Municipal Treasurer that the appellate
court docket fee and appeal bond had been deposited with his office. It
was further pointed out that the Justice of the Peace of Calauan had no
legal, nor moral obligation to cash the money order for the appellate
court docket fee and then pay it to the Municipal Treasurer and,
thereafter, secure from the latter the certificate of deposit to be
filed with the records of the case.</p>
  <p>    In denying plaintiff-appellant's motion to dismiss, the lower court stated:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"
There is no question that the notice of appeal which was enclosed with
the letter of counsel for the defendant to the Justice of the Peace of
Calauan was filed on time, the said letter having been posted by
special delivery-registered mail in Manila on November 16, 1950. It is
also undisputed that the two money orders were enclosed with the notice
of appeal and that the letter of counsel for the defendant to the
Municipal Treasurer of Calauan bringing to his attention that the
appellate court docket fee and appeal bond had been forwarded to the
Justice of the Peace of the same municipality, was posted by special
delivery-registered mail on November 16, 1950, the same day the other
letter was sent. It is clear, therefore, that had the defendant caused
the money order of P16.00 to be payable to the Municipal Treasurer of
Calauan and enclosed it and the other money order with the letter sent
to the said official, the appeal, according to the admission of counsel
for-the plaintiff, would have been perfected on time for for the reason
that 'pursuant to the provisions of Section 1, Rule 27 of the Rules of
Court, the mailing of the payment of deposit with, the proper office or
official, as shown by the post office registry receipt, is the date of
payment of deposit.' <i>In other words, the mistake, if me maybe
attributed to the defendant, was in having the money order for P16.00
intended for the appellate court docket fee to be issued payable to the
Justice of the Peace of Calauan instead of to the Municipal Treasurer
of said municipality and in sending the two money orders to the former
instead of to the latter official</i>.</p>
    <p>"<i>In this
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the rules of
procedure in inferior courts regarding appeals need not be strictly and
rigidly complied with because the sense of justice and equity should
prevail as against the technicality of the law. This is specially true
where the appellant acted in good faith and had no intention to unduly
delay the termination of the case</i> (Castro <i>vs.</i> Justice of the Peace of Bocaue, 33 Phil., 595; Contreras <i>vs.</i> Dinglasan, 79 Phil 42; 45 Off. Gaz., 257; Alandy <i>vs.</i> San Jose, 79 Phil., 811; 45 Off. Gaz. 2829, 2831). "In the case of Alandy <i>vs.</i> San Jose, <i>supra</i>,
the Justice of the Peace required the appellant to post an, appeal bond
of P200.00 and so the latter did not file the bond required in the
order or even that prescribed in the Rules of Court because he had an
understanding with the Justice of the Peace that he would raise the
legality of the order in question before the Court of First Instance.
When the records of the case were received in the Court of First
Instance, the appellee moved for the dismissal of the appeal on account
of the failure of the appellant to post an appeal bond. The Court of
First Instance granted the motion but on appeal, the Supreme Court
reversed the judgment and in effect held that when the failure of the
appellants to file an appeal bond in time was due to an error of the
Justice of the Peace, they would not be deprived of their right to be
heard in the Court of First Instance.</p>
    <p>"In another case
(Aligarbes us. Aguilar, et al., G. R. No. L- 15736, promulgated on
January 20, 1964), the plaintiff was authorized to sue as a pauper in a
forcible entry and detainer case. After due hearing, the complaint was
dismissed. Within the reglementary period, the plaintiff filed a motion
to appeal as a pauper together with a notice of appeal to the Court of
First Instance. The Justice of the Peace issued an order that he had no
authority to permit the plaintiff to litigate as a pauper on appeal and
that such permission may only be granted by the Court of First
Instance. However, the same Judge transmitted the records of the case
to the superior court 'for its proper determination in the premises'.
The case was docketed in the Court of First Instance but after the
issues had been joined and the trial had been commenced, the Presiding
Judge of said Court <i>motu proprio</i> issued an order directing the
return of the records of the case to the court of origin for execution
of judgment as the docketing thereof in the appellate court was
illegal, the docketing fees not having been paid nor had the appellant
been exempted from the payment thereof by the Court. On petition for
review by writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court ordered the return of
the records to the Justice of the Peace so that he may pass upon the
petition to appeal as pauper and the Court of First Instance may also
act thereafter upon request of the litigant from payment held that—</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
'It would now be unfair to hold that the decision of the Justice of the
Peace has become final. The plaintiff took all the steps necessary to
perfect his appeal; and it was only thru the error of said officer, and
of the Clerk of Court that the matter of court fees has not been
attended to. There being no question as to appellant's inability to
pay, he should be afforded opportunity to comply with procedural
requirements to enable him to prosecute his suit.'</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"<i>In
the light of the foregoing precedents, the Court is of the opinion and
so holds that it would be unjust to dismiss the defendant's appeal on
the mere technicality that he did not send directly the money orders to
the Municipal Treasurer of Calauan and in causing the issuance of one
of them in the name of the Justice of the Peace. Moreover; the
defendant should not be made to suffer from the mistake of the Justice
of the Peace in advising the Municipal Treasurer not to cask the money
order intended for appeal bond and in also doing likewise with respect
to the money order for the appellate court docket fee. In any event the
required amounts had been eventually deposited with the Municipal
Treasurer of Calauan and the appealed case had already been docketed in
this Court. The lapse in the literal observance of Sections 2 and 9 of
Rule 40, of the Rules of Court could be overlooked as it did not
involve public policy and arose from an honest mistake</i> (Etherl Case and Minna Hartz <i>vs.</i> Jugo, 43 Off. Gaz. No. 11)." (Italics supplied.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
In the light of the above findings of fact of the lower court and the
rulings of this Court therein cited, we are of the opinion and so hold,
that said court committed no error in denying plaintiff-appellant's
motion to dismiss defendant-appellee's appeal of November 12, 1954.</p>
  <p>    There is another reason why the order in question should be upheld. In De los Reyes <i>vs.</i> Elepaño, <i>supra</i>,
the question raised was whether the judgment rendered by the Justice of
the Peace Court of Calauan in the detainer case had already become
final and executory in view of the alleged failure of defendant to
perfect his appeal within the reglementary period. As already stated,
we held in said case that under the circumstances of the case, the
notice of appeal of appellant (defendant) <i>was filed in due time</i>
and that the decision of the Justice of the Peace had not yet become
final and executory. Plaintiff could have raised in said case the
question she presented in her motion) to dismiss defendant's appeal
dated November 12, 1954. Having failed to do so, she could not now
raise the same question (failure to perfect his appeal for reasons
stated in said motion) for the matter is deemed <i>res adjudicata</i>.
The rule is that a judgment is conclusive not only upon questions
actually contested, but also upon matters which might have been
litigated and decided in the same suit, and the estoppel applies where
defenses which were available in the first action but not set up are
sought to be used in a second action either by way of defense or as the
foundation of a claim for relief. (Soriano vs, De Leon, et al., G. R.
No. L-7863, prom. August 31, 1959.)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"* * *
a judgment is conclusive not only upon the questions actually contested
and determined, but upon all matters which might have been litigated
and decided in that suit; and this is undoubtedly true of all matters
properly belonging to the subject of the controversy and within the
scope of the issues, so that each party must make the most of his case
or defense, bringing forward all his facts, grounds, reasons, or
evidence in support of it, on pain of being barred from showing such
omitted matters in a subsequent suit; and it is also true that, where
the second suit is upon the same cause of action, all matters which
might have been litigated are conclusively settled by the judgment; and
that generally the estoppel applies where defenses which were available
in the first action, but not then set up are sought to be used in a
second action either by way of defense or as the foundation of a claim
for relief." 34 C. J. 909-911, cited in Tejedor, et al., <i>vs.</i> Palet, et al., 61 Phil., 494.)</p>
