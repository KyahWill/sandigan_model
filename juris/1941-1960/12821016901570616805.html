				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioners, under the trade name of Lealda Electric Light, Inc., are the 
owners and operators of an electric light plant supplying electricity in Legaspi 
and Tabaco, Albay. Upon complaint of some customers, the Public Service 
Commission3 thru its Secretary, addressed on July 13, 1948, a letter to the 
petitioners requiring compliance with thirteen instructions four of which 
(involved herein) read as follows:
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Instruction No. 8</em>.—Charge for flat rate service in accordance with 
Sections 97 and 98, Revised Order No. 1, of the Public Service Commission;</p>
<p><em>"Instruction No. 11.</em>—Revise all bills for metered service already 
rendered to the effect that the minimum charge of P6 should not be added to the 
charge for actual kwh consumption. It should be charged only when the customer 
uses less than 15 kwh per.month;</p>
<p><em>"Instruction No. 12.</em>— Desist from collecting P1 as meter rental per 
month; and</p>
<p><em>"Instruction No. 13.</em>—Refund or credit to customers in subsequent 
bills all overcharges made."</p></blockquote>
<p>On July 29, 1948, the petitioners filed a motion for the reconsideration of 
the four instructions above-quoted, which motion was denied by the Public 
Service Commission on December 28, 1948. Hence the present petition for 
review.</p>
<p>1. Under instruction No. 8, the petitioners are required to stop from 
collecting light bills in advance for flat rate service. The basis of this 
directive is sections 97 and 98 of Revised Order No. 1 of the Public Service 
Commission, issued on November 27, 1941, providing as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 97. <em>Payment of Bills</em>.—A public service may require that bills 
for service be paid within a specified time after rendition. When the billing 
period covers a month or more,, the minimum time allowed will be ten days and 
upon expiration of the specified time, service may be discontinued for the 
nonpayment of bills, provided that a H-8 hours' written notice of such 
disconnection has been given the customer; <em>Provided however</em>, That 
disconnections of service shall not be made on Sundays and official holidays and 
never after 2 p.m., of any working day: <em>Provided further</em>, That if at 
the moment the disconnection is to be made the customer tenders payment of the 
unpaid bill to the agent or employee of the operator who is to effect the 
disconnection, the said agent or employee shall be obliged to to accept tendered 
payment and issue a temporary receipt for the amount and shall desist from 
disconnecting the service."</p>
<p>"Sec. 98. <em>Bills for Metered and Flat Rate. Service</em>.—Bills to metered 
service customers shall be rendered at reasonably regular intervals and shall 
show at least the date upon which the meter was last read, the reading of the 
meter on that date, the number and kinds of -units, supplied, reference to the 
schedule of rates applicable and the amount of the bill.</p>
<p>"Bills to flat rate service customers shall be rendered at reasonably regular 
intervals and shall show the period for which the bills is rendered, reference 
to the schedule of rate applicable and the amount of the bill. The number and 
kinds of units for which a flat rate bill is rendered shall also be shown on the 
bill."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is contended that these provisions do not prohibit collection in advance, 
as the provision of Section 97 that "a public service may require that bills for 
service be paid within a specified time after rendition," is merely permissive 
and relates to the matter of disconnection of service, and as Section 98 (which 
expressly covers metered and flat rate service) does not outlaw such advance 
collection.</p>
<p>The contention is without merit. Section 97 plainly refers to "Payment of 
Bills," and Section 98 to rendition of bills. In the absence of any 
qualification, Section 97 must be construed as including charges for flat rate 
and metered service; and since it is specifically provided therein that payment 
of bills may be required within a specified time "after rendition" of service, 
it follows that collection of charges for service not yet rendered is not 
authorized. It is true that the word "may" is used, but this term may be 
construed, as it is in this case clearly is intended to be, in a mandatory 
sense. Indeed, this provision is unnecessary if operators may, at their option, 
demand payment in. advance. On the other hand, section 98 speaks only of the 
manner of rendering bills, without regard to their payment, and cannot therefore 
support petitioners' stand.</p>
<p>The petitioners can neither invoke the cases in which the Public Service 
Commission seemed to have allowed collection of light bills in advance, first, 
because the Commission should have the power to revoke and correct erroneous 
policies or rulings and, secondly, because, as held in Raymundo Transportation 
Co. <em>vs</em>. Tanay Transit Co. and Yangco, (63 Phil. 1064), "in proceedings 
before a commission, which involve either directly or as a necessary 
consequence, the annulment, modification or alteration of a previous order by it 
entered, the doctrine of estoppel or <em>res judicata</em>, as usually applied 
to judgment of courts of record, is without application whatever."</p>
<p>Moreover, under their reconstituted certificate of public convenience and 
necessity, the petitioners have not been given authority to collect bills in 
advance. At any rate, by virtue of an order of the Commission dated February 16, 
1949, the petitioners are authorized to require customers to make a deposit 
equivalent to one month's bill, with the result that the petitioners already 
have some security for the payment of electric consumption.</p>
<p>II. The petitioners are authorized to charge the following rates for electric 
consumptions</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2">First 15 kwh</td>
<td width="50%">P0.40</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2">Next 35 kwh</td>
<td>.35</td></tr>
<tr>

<td colspan="2">Next .50 kwh</td>
<td>.30</td></tr>
<tr>

<td>.20</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td width="2%">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="43%">200 watts, or less;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2">For connection of 200 watts, P0.01 per watt connection.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>In case a customer with a 200-watt connection consumes 20 kwh in a month, the 
petitioners charge the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="3">15 kwh at P0.40 a kwh</td>
<td width="50%">P6.00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="3">5 kwh at P0.35 a kwh</td>
<td>1.75</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="3">Minimum charge per month for connection of 200 </td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td width="2%">&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2">watts</td>
<td>6.00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
<td>__________</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td width="12%">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="31%">Total</td>
<td>P13.75</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>By instruction No. 11, the petitioners are directed to desist from charging 
the minimum rate of P6, in addition to the cost of the fluid actually consumed. 
In other words, in the example given, the customer will have to pay only P7.75.. 
A, customer, however, is required to pay the fixed minimum of P6 if the cost of 
his consumption is less than: such rate. Thus, if a customer uses only 10 kwh in 
a month, the actual cost of this consumption is P4.00: and yet he has to pay the 
minimum rate of P6.00. This is the construction adopted by the Commission of the 
schedule of rates which the petitioners are authorized to collect, and such 
construction is reasonable.and correct.</p>
<p>We cannot accept the theory of the petitioners that the amount of P6 in 
question is to be paid monthly by a customer for having a 200-watt connection. 
In.the first place, connection is installed by the petitioners only once. In the 
second place, such connection is necessary, if the petitioners are to have 
customers.</p>
<p>III. By instruction No. 12, the petitioners are required to desist from 
collecting from their customers the sum of P1 as monthly meter rental. This 
instruction is assailed by petitioners on the ground that they have heretofore 
been allowed by the Commission to collect such rental, which represents a 
nominal fee for the use of or damage to electric meters. The position of 
petitioners is not tenable, because the cases invoked by them are anterior to 
Revised Order No 1 of the Public Service Commission which, under Commonwealth 
Act No. 146, is empowered to issue regulations governing public services. The 
instruction in question is reasonable, the installation of the meter being an 
essential part of the service rendered to a customer. To allow the permanent 
collection of a monthly rental would give the petitioners a profit 
disproportionate to the cost of a meter.</p>
<p>IV. The petitioners also assail instruction No. 13, requiring them to refund 
or credit to customers in subsequent bills all overcharges previously made, and 
their main argument is that the Commission has no power to impose such severe 
punishment which only a judicial court can impose. This is without merit, as the 
requirement is not in the nature of a penalty, but is merely a measure by which 
the petitioners are asked to return what they did not have the right to collect. 
The order is not unduly hard to comply with, because the petitioners have the 
option either to refund.overcharges or to credit them in subsequent bills.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the present petition for review is dismissed with costs against 
the petitioners. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor</em>, and <em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, 
concur. </p></div>
