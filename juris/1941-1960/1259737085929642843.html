				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is a petition to review by certiorari&nbsp; the decision of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Agrarian Relations in&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 224– NE-56&nbsp;&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; Tiburcio&nbsp; Somera,&nbsp; Julian Domingo and Ciriaco&nbsp; Pomeda&nbsp; (petitioners&nbsp; herein)&nbsp; to reinstate petitioner Agripino Galman (respondent herein) as tenant in the landholding in question, and to reimburse the latter, jointly&nbsp; and&nbsp; severally, 116 and 15/100 cavans of&nbsp; palay of&nbsp; 46&nbsp; kilos&nbsp; each corresponding&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; crop harvest&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1955-56,&nbsp; sentencing,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; Galman&nbsp; to deliver&nbsp; to respondent&nbsp; Somera 19 and 15/100 cavans&nbsp; of 46&nbsp; kilos each, representing over&nbsp; deliveries&nbsp; made to&nbsp; the former&nbsp; for the&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1954-55,&nbsp; after&nbsp; a re-liquidation&nbsp; was undertaken by the court.<br><br>It appears that petitioner Tiburcio Somera is the owner of a tract of land comprising an area of about 56 hectares situated at barrio Sta. Barbara,&nbsp; San&nbsp; Antonio,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija.&nbsp; The clearing and cultivation of said land was first begun in the agricultural year&nbsp; 1954-55.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent Agripino Galman,&nbsp; who claims to be a share tenant of Somera, received at the end of each&nbsp; agricultural year&nbsp; a&nbsp; certain quantity of palay depending on the amount of the produce.<br><br>Hence, for&nbsp; the&nbsp; crop harvest year&nbsp; 1954-55,&nbsp; he received 160&nbsp; cavans&nbsp; of palay&nbsp; and for the&nbsp; succeeding&nbsp; year, 355 cavans.&nbsp; <br><br>On April&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; Somera leased to his co-petitioners Julian Domingo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Ciriaco&nbsp; Pomeda the property&nbsp; in question.&nbsp; By virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; this lease&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp;&nbsp; admitted having&nbsp; ejected Galman, rendering him&nbsp; without&nbsp;&nbsp; work.&nbsp; This suit was originated by the latter with the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agrarian court seeking for&nbsp; his&nbsp; reinstatement&nbsp; as tenant&nbsp;&nbsp; and a reliquidation of the harvest for the past agricultural years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It is the contention of the petitioners in the court below, as well as&nbsp; in this&nbsp; appeal, that no&nbsp; tenancy&nbsp; relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; established between Somera and Galman, claiming&nbsp;&nbsp; that the latter&nbsp; was but&nbsp; a mere trusted farm watcher,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that there was no need for a tenant as the land is and&nbsp; has always been under mechanized&nbsp; farming.&nbsp; We believe otherwise.<br><br>The tenancy relationship between petitioner Somera, as the landholder, and&nbsp; respondent Galman, as the tenant, is borne out by the evidence and the findings of fact of the Court of Agrarian Relations.&nbsp; For instance, Galman has been&nbsp; shown to&nbsp; be&nbsp; principally&nbsp; responsible, through his&nbsp; labor, in the cultivation of the land,&nbsp; with the help of his two&nbsp; sons,. Adriano&nbsp; and&nbsp; Anselmo;&nbsp; the&nbsp; former&nbsp; operating the tractor&nbsp; and the latter, together with hired&nbsp; laborers engaged by&nbsp; the landowner, broadcasting the seeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is admitted that for his&nbsp; work, Galman receives not a&nbsp; fixed amount or paid&nbsp; an&nbsp; ordinary wage, as is usually the case for&nbsp; hired farmhand,&nbsp; but a certain quantity&nbsp; of&nbsp; palay depending on the yearly harvest.<br><br>The fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; landholding is&nbsp; under&nbsp; mechanized farming&nbsp; does not alter the&nbsp; situation, nor does it necessarily preclude the&nbsp; employment&nbsp; of&nbsp; tenants by the landholder within the meaning of the&nbsp; law, aside from or in addition to hired laborers; and once this tenancy relationship is established, the tenant is entitled&nbsp; to the security of tenure and&nbsp; may not be dispossessed except for just causes provided in&nbsp; the law, or until the tenancy relationship is legally&nbsp; terminated.&nbsp; (See&nbsp; Primero <i>vs.</i> Court of Agrarian&nbsp; Relations, et al., 101&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 675; 54 Off. Gaz. [20] 5506.)&nbsp; The work of hired farm laborers is delineated usually by the landowner, while that of a tenant&nbsp; is defined&nbsp; under the&nbsp; law (see sections&nbsp; 23 and&nbsp; 38, Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1199).<br><br>Of&nbsp; course, under section 50 of the tenancy Act,&nbsp; the <span style="font-style: italic;">bonafide </span>intention of the&nbsp; landholder to cultivate the land "himself",&nbsp; either, personally or through the employment of mechanical&nbsp; implements gives him&nbsp; right to&nbsp; dispossess the tenant of the land; but he can do so only upon authority of the&nbsp; agrarian court&nbsp; and after complying with certain procedural requirements (see section 50(a), Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1199),&nbsp; that were not observed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since in this case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; cause for the dispossession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the tenant Galman, as&nbsp; found by the agrarian court, was the leasing of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land to the petitioners&nbsp; Domingo and&nbsp; Pomeda, the ejectment was illegal and null and void (Primero <i>vs.</i> Court&nbsp; of Agrarian Relations,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>; Sec. 9, Rep. Act No. 1199).<br><br>Before&nbsp; leasing the&nbsp; property in question to the petitioners&nbsp; Domingo and&nbsp; Pomeda,&nbsp; Somera&nbsp; announced&nbsp; his intention of leasing the same to the respondent&nbsp; herein, who manifested his desire to be the lessee himself provided, however, that the tractor be included in the contract.&nbsp; This did not materialize on&nbsp; account&nbsp; of Somera's&nbsp; refusal&nbsp; to include&nbsp; the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot&nbsp; agree&nbsp; with petitioner's proposition that&nbsp; this act&nbsp; of the&nbsp; respondent constituted a voluntary surrender of the land on&nbsp; his part (a cause for dispossession under Sec. 9, Republic Act 1199).&nbsp; Nothing appears to have been further&nbsp; said or done by the respondent as would warrant such a&nbsp; conclusion.<br><br>Passing now.to the method of reliquidation used by the agrarian court.&nbsp; The sharing agreement between Somera and Galman was found to be 70-30 in favor of the land-holder, the latter supplying the farm implements, seedlings and all expenses for clearing, broadcasting and cultivation, while the tenant supplied&nbsp; labor and manpower, conformably to the provisions of the Agricultural Tenancy Act.<br><br>The evidence and findings of the lower court show that for&nbsp; the&nbsp; agricultural years&nbsp; 1954-55&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1955-56,&nbsp; the landholding in question had a gross harvest of 645 and 1,827 cavans of&nbsp; palay, respectively.&nbsp; The deductible items for the first crop harvest&nbsp; year were itemized and proven to be 34&nbsp; cavans for seeds, 109&nbsp; cavans for reaping and 32.5 cavan&nbsp; (equivalent to&nbsp; 5.2% of 645) for&nbsp; threshing. However,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the second&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; year,&nbsp; no deductible items were proven&nbsp; (according to the lower court, because of oversight of counsel)&nbsp; except for 54&nbsp; cavans incurred&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; seedling&nbsp; purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; fairness&nbsp;&nbsp; to the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp;&nbsp; Somera, the agrarian court awarded in his favor&nbsp; deductible items of&nbsp; 109&nbsp; cavans&nbsp; for&nbsp; reaping and&nbsp; 5.2 %&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; gross harvest of&nbsp; 1,827&nbsp; cavans for threshing based&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; the preceding year.<br><br>The computation&nbsp; made by the lower court for the agricultural year 1954-55 is not disputed.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the year 1955-56, petitioners&nbsp; question&nbsp; the deduction&nbsp; of only&nbsp; 109&nbsp; cavans of palay as reaping expenses, claiming that said quantity&nbsp; is based on the gross harvest of only 645&nbsp;&nbsp; cavans for the year 1954-55&nbsp; while the gross harvest for&nbsp;&nbsp; the second year was 1,827.&nbsp; We find merit in this contention, for necessarily,&nbsp;&nbsp; a greater&nbsp; harvest&nbsp; entails&nbsp; increased reaping expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated&nbsp; by the petitioners,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the preceding agricultural year of 1954-55, the reaping expenses are approximately 16.9%,&nbsp; and applying this to&nbsp; the gross&nbsp; harvest of 1,827&nbsp; cavans in&nbsp; 1955-56, the&nbsp; deductible item on this&nbsp; account&nbsp; should be&nbsp; 308.76 cavans instead of 109.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; we have the following final computation:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="5"><div align="center"><i>"Agricultural Year 1954-1955 </i></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5">PRODUCE: Cavans </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="28%">Harvest</td> <td width="20%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="19%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="23%"><div align="right">645</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">Loose grains (none) </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">0</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">_____</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">TOTAL gross harvest </td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">645</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="5">DEDUCTIBLE ITEMS: Advances by T.
