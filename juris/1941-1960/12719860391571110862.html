				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case presents queer  questions of  procedure that may be said to have arisen from a comedy of errors.<br><br>We  glean the  following essential facts from thirty-two pages  of pleadings in which  they  have been buried by the prolixity of counsel:<br><br><blockquote>On March 21,  1938, the petitioners filed in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija a petition to review a decree of registration issued on September 10, 1937,  in favor of the respondent Ysidra Cojuangco  covering lot 84 (now lot A-l) of land  registration case No. 1856, alleging that said decree had been  obtained thru fraud.   To said petition Ysidra Cojuangco filed an opposition.  On October 2, 1940, Judge  Roberto  Concepcion  ordered  the parties to  file affidavits of merit in support of their respective contentions. After due  consideration of the petition and of the opposition, in  relation to the affidavits  and other documentary evidence submitted  by the parties,  Judge Concepcion, on January 31, 1941, entered an order in which he found in substance  that no fraud had been committed,  and  denied the petition to reopen and revise the decree.</blockquote><br>Of that  order the attorney for the petitioners was notified on February 14, 1941.  On February 17, 1941, said attorney filed simultaneously two separate motions, one entitled  "Motion for Reconsideration,"  which  he  set  for hearing on March 10, 1941, and the other entitled "Motion for New Trial," which he set for hearing on March  17, 1941.  The object  of both motions was to  attack and  set aside the said order of January 31, 1941,  on the ground that it was contrary to law and to the evidence.  The motion  for reconsideration was  supported by  an extensive argument,  which  was  reproduced and incorporated  by reference in the motion for new trial.<br><br>On March 10, 1941,  Judge Guillermo F.  Pablo denied the motion for reconsideration in a written  order of which the attorney for the petitioners was notified on the following day, March 11, 1941.<br><br>The motion for  new  trial was heard, as scheduled, on March 17, 1941,  by  the  same judge.  According to the attorney for the petitioners, said judge had  not yet entered any order eitKer granting or denying said motion for new trial up to the time the present petition for certiorari was filed in this court  on May 14, 1941; but according to  the attorney for the  respondents, said motion for new trial was  denied by Judge Pablo on the same date  it was heard, March 17, 1941, "although the  stenographic notes of the order of denial were not transcribed in view of the absence of Judge Pablo who then took his vacation."<br><br>The petitioners  took  no steps to appeal  from the order of Judge  Concepcion of January  31, 1941,  denying their petition for review, notwithstanding that their motion for reconsideration had been denied since March 10, 1941; but in their petition for certiorari in this Court they manifest:<br><br><blockquote>"16. That in the event  said motion for new trial will be denied, it was  and is always the  desire of  the plaintiffs-petitioners to appeal the order of January 31, 1941, alleged in paragraph 11 hereof to the Hon. Court of Appeals for the review of the points of law and of facts in controversy."<br><br><br>On April 8, 1941, the respondent Ysidra Cojuangco  filed a motion asking the court to declare final its order of January 31, 1941, which motion  was granted by the respondent judge, Honorable Sotero Rodas, in his order of April 17, 1941.<br><br>A motion for reconsideration and a  second motion for reconsideration of said order of Judge  Rodas having successively been denied by the court, the petitioners instituted in this court the present  action  for  certiorari,  praying (1)  That the respondent judge be required to certify to this court the whole record and transcript of the proceedings in  land  registration case  No. 1856, especially that with reference to their petition to revise the decree; (2) that the respondent judge  "be ordered  to  refrain  from further proceeding  in the matter  herein  sought to be  reviewed until further order of this court;" and (3)  "that after hearing the parties, a judgment be rendered declaring the order of April 17, 1941, to be null  and void, that on  account of the  frauds  committed  by the  defendant-respondent Ysidra Cojuangco in unduly  registering lot A-l in her status and capacity  as coapplicant of Alberto Garcia, the reopening of the case be ordered,  allowing and giving the plaintiffs-petitioners herein a chance and a day in court to present their evidence to prove and establish their right and ownership upon lot A-l,  and conceding to the  plaintiffs-petitioners such further and other relief as in the  opinion of the court the plaintiffs-petitioners are justly and equitably entitled, with costs."</blockquote><br>1. It will be noted from the above-quoted  prayer of the petitioners that, while ostensibly their purpose in instituting the present certiorari proceeding is to assail the validity of  the order of Judge  Rodas of April 17, 1941,  their principal objective  is the  revision  and  reversal by this court of the order of Judge Concepcion of January  31, 1941, denying their petition for review.  That, obviously, is not permissible.  Even if the said order of Judge Rodas did  not exist, the petitioners could not, by  certiorari, ask this court to  revise and reverse the order of Judge Concepcion denying their petition. The ordinary remedy of appeal cannot be supplanted by or converted into the extraordinary remedy of certiorari by the  circumstance that the respondent judge has declared said order final.  If the order in question has really become final, it cannot be reviewed on certiorari.  Neither  may this remedy be availed of if the said order is not yet final or still appealable, as petitioners contend; for in that case the petitioners should appeal.  Therefore, under either hypothesis, the real and main purpose of  the  petitioners  in  instituting  this proceeding cannot prosper.<br><br>2. There  remains to be considered the  ostensible and secondary purpose, namely, to test the validity of the order of Judge Rodas of April 17, 1941,  declaring final the order of Judge Concepcion of January 31, 1941.<br><br>A series  of avoidable  errors have brought about this incident.  It was an error on  the part of counsel  for the petitioners  to  present on  the same day two separate motions—one for  reconsideration  and the  other for  new trial—for practically the same purpose,  and to set  them for hearing on different dates.  There was no imaginable reason for  that.  Lawyers should not indulge in superfluities.  They  should  realize  that  the  court's  time is valuable and that to file two separate motions on the  same grounds and for the  same purpose  is to trifle with the court.  Certainly,  counsel had no reason  to speculate that the court would decide his motion  for new trial differently from his motion  for  reconsideration, the former being based on substantially  the same grounds and supported by exactly the same arguments as those of the latter.  Moreover, the Rules of Court do not permit the filing of a second motion  for new trial unless "on a ground not existing when the first motion  was made."   (Section 4, rule 37.)<br><br>Another  error was committed by someone when the order denying the superfluous motion for new trial was not transcribed.  But such error is of no consequence because, since the court should  not  be imposed   upon or trifled with,  it should not  entertain the  socalled  motion for new trial  after having  denied the same motion under another label—reconsideration. We  might add that the labeling of the second motion as one for  "new trial" was not even a good disguise.  There  having  been no trial on the petition to revise  the decree  of  registration because, after a preliminary consideration thereof, the court found it to be devoid of merit, the petitioners could not logically ask for a new trial.  The motion for reconsideration was the proper  writing to file; and  after the trial court had considered and denied it, the petitioners exhausted their remedies  there.<br><br>It was not necessary for the respondent  Ysidra Cojuangco to  file a motion for, nor for the court to enter, an  order declaring its previous order final.  An order or decision becomes  final by  operation of  law  and  not by judicial declaration.<br><br>Said order became final <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso jure</span> after thirty days from the date the parties were notified thereof,  deducting the period from the presentation of the motion for reconsideration to the  notice of the order denying the same.  The so-called motion for new trial, being superfluous and improper, produced no legal effect whatsoever regardless of whether or not the court failed to decide it.  Even in cases where a motion for reconsideration and a motion for new trial are both permissible, this Court has decided that the presentation of the latter does not suspend the  time for appeal if the grounds of the motion for reconsideration are the same  as those of  the motion for new trial.  (Aquino vs. Tongco,  61 Phil., 840; Laquian vs. Reyes  [August 25, 1938], 38 Off. Gaz., 2284; Levett vs. Sy Quia et al. [August 27, 1935], 61 Phil., 847;  Ebro  vs.  Fernandez [April 14, 1941], G. R. No.  47723.)  In the present case, there was not even a plausible excuse  for the presentation of a motion for new trial.<br><br>The writ prayed for is denied, and the  petition is hereby dismissed, with costs.  So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abad Santos, Diaz, Moran</span>,  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ.</span>, concur. Writ denied, and petition  dismissed.<br></div>
