				<H3>THE PEOPLE OP THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE NABORA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On the night of December 3,&nbsp; 1940,&nbsp; while the&nbsp; accused Vicente Nabora was taking a walk along the new Luneta, the deceased&nbsp; Domingo de Vera met him near the site of the flagpole and&nbsp; pointing&nbsp; his&nbsp; finger&nbsp; at him (accused) asked him what he was doing there and then&nbsp; said:&nbsp; "Don't you know we are&nbsp; watching for honeymooners here"?&nbsp; Provoked by the&nbsp; attitude of the deceased, the accused drew&nbsp; out his knife and stabbed the deceased on the abdomen and on the other parts of the body which caused the latter his instant death. An information for homicide was filed against the accused wherein it was alleged that&nbsp; he is a "recidivist, he having been previously convicted three times of physical injuries" and "punished once&nbsp; of robbery, three times of theft, and twice of illegal possession of a deadly weapon, by virtue of final judgments of competent courts."&nbsp; Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge and was allowed to&nbsp; testify on mitigating circumstances in his favor. The trial court then sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of from 10 years and 1 day of&nbsp; <i>prision mayor</i> to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> and to pay the heirs of the deceased an indemnity of P2,000, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.&nbsp; This judgment is now sought to be reviewed in this appeal.<br><br>By defendant's plea&nbsp; of guilty, he admits the aggravating circumstances of recidivism and <i>reiteracion</i> alleged in the information.&nbsp; In partial offset, he is entitled to one mitigating circumstance—voluntary plea of guilty.&nbsp; His claim to another mitigating circumstance—that of sufficient provocation on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the deceased—cannot be&nbsp; sustained. The provocation, to constitute a mitigating circumstance, must, in the language of the&nbsp; law, be "sufficient", that is, adequate to excite&nbsp; the&nbsp; person to commit .the wrong&nbsp; and must accordingly be proportionate to its gravity.&nbsp; In the instant case, it can hardly be&nbsp; said that the acts&nbsp; of the deceased in pointing&nbsp; his finger at the defendant and uttering the question aforementioned constitute a sufficient cause for him to draw out his knife and&nbsp; kill the deceased.<br><br>Appellant is accordingly sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of not less than 10 years and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> and not more than 18 years of reclusion temporal,&nbsp; and in all&nbsp; other&nbsp; respects,&nbsp; the judgment is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against appellant.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avancena, C.
