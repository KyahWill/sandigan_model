				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The City of Manila&nbsp; instituted this action for the collection of a sum of money allegedly due from the defendant Inter-Island Gas Service,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; by&nbsp; way of&nbsp; deficiency municipal tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main issue is whether liquefied flammable gas comes within&nbsp; the purview of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; Group&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; of Ordinance No.&nbsp; 1925 of the&nbsp; City of Manila,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended by Ordinance No. 3364 thereof, which&nbsp; provides that:<blockquote><p>"* * * there shall&nbsp; be paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; the City Treasurer for engaging in any of the&nbsp; businesses or occupations below enumerated, quarterly license&nbsp; fees based on gross&nbsp; sales&nbsp; or receipts&nbsp; realized&nbsp; during the preceding quarter, in accordance&nbsp; with the rates herein&nbsp; prescribed: <em>Provided,&nbsp; however,</em> That a person engaging in any business or occupation for the first time shall pay the initial license fee based on the probable gross sales or receipts for the first quarter beginning from the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opening of the business as indicated&nbsp; herein for the&nbsp; corresponding business or&nbsp; occupation.</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote>&nbsp;"<em>Group&nbsp; 2</em>.â€”Retail&nbsp; dealers in new (not yet used) merchandise, which dealers are not yet subject to&nbsp; the payment&nbsp; of any municipal tax, such&nbsp; as:&nbsp; (1) Retail dealers in general merchandise and (2) retail dealers&nbsp; exclusively&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; the sale of electrical supplies; sporting goods; office equipment and materials; rice; textile including knitted wares; hardwares, including, glasswares; cooking utensils and construction materials; papers; books, including stationary."

That the defendant paid the different amounts alleged in paragraph 4 of the complaint corresponding to the quarters therein stated under Ordinance No. 1925,&nbsp; as last amended by Ordinance No. 3364, based on its&nbsp; sales of cooking appliances only;</p><p>"'4.&nbsp; That the total claim of the&nbsp; plaintiff against the defendant under section 1, Group 2, of Ordinance No. 1925,&nbsp; as&nbsp; last amended by Ordinance No. 3364 is Pll,250.00, based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; sales alleged in paragraph 2 of the complaint&nbsp; computed at the rate of Pl,250.00 quarterly corresponding to the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 1951, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; first quarter of 1952; and</p><p>" '5.&nbsp; That the&nbsp; defendant has paid&nbsp; the prescribed&nbsp; fees under Ordinance No. 3259 of the City of Manila, 'An Ordinance prescribing regulations for&nbsp; storage, installations,&nbsp; use and transportation&nbsp; of compressed and liquefied inflammable&nbsp; gases other&nbsp; than acetylene, and providing fees therefor', covering the&nbsp; same quarters mentioned in paragraph 4 of the complaint."</p></blockquote><p>Then the case was submitted for decision, whereupon the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila rendered judgment for the&nbsp; plaintiff, the&nbsp; dispositive part of which, as amended, reads as&nbsp; follows:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Therefore,</em> this Court is of the&nbsp; opinion and so holds, that the City Government of Manila has the right to impose tax on liquefied flammable gas under Ordinance No. 1925, as amended by Ordinance No.&nbsp; 3364.&nbsp; And for this reason,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Inter-Island Gas Service, Inc., is&nbsp; hereby sentenced to&nbsp; pay to the City of Manila the sum of F8,361 as deficiency tax due from the&nbsp; year 1952,&nbsp; inclusive, including the amount of P50 as surcharge thereon,&nbsp; and the payment of the costs * * *"</p></blockquote><p>The defendant has&nbsp; appealed from this decision and now in maintains that:</p><ol><li>"The lower court erred in not&nbsp; holding and declaring that the No. 1925 as amended (imposing a tax for purposes of revenue), does not clearly provided that it applies to the sale of liquefied flammable gas.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>"The lower court erred in not holding and declaring that the provisions of section 1, Group 2, of Ordinance No. 1925, as amended by Ordinance No. 3364, are and clearly within the legislative powers granted to the Municipal Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, if said Ordinance is applied to the sale of&nbsp; liquefied flammable gas.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>"That assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that under the provisions of section 1, Group 2, of Ordinance No.&nbsp; 1925, as last amended by Ordinance No. 3364, liquefied flammable gas&nbsp; is included, still the&nbsp; lower court erred in not finding and declaring that said Ordinance No. 1925, as&nbsp; amended, is a.percentage&nbsp; tax; hence,&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint does&nbsp; not state a cause of action because no allegation has been made that the ordinance&nbsp; in&nbsp; question&nbsp; had previously been&nbsp; approved by&nbsp; the President of the Philippines.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>"Further&nbsp; assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that&nbsp; Ordinance&nbsp; No. 1925,&nbsp; as amended, is valid, yet the lower court erred in not finding that to apply it to the liquefied gas business of the defendant will constitute double taxation; hence, unconstitutional and void.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>"The lower court&nbsp; erred in ordering the defendant to pay&nbsp; the City of Manila the sum of P8.861.00 as deficiency tax due&nbsp; under Ordinance No. 1925, as&nbsp; amended by Ordinance No. 3364, and to pay the costs."</li></ol><p>In support of the first two assignments of error appellant cites paragraphs (m)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (o)&nbsp; of section 18 of the Revised Charter of Manila (Republic Act No. 409) authorizing said city:</p><blockquote><p>"'(<em>m</em>) To&nbsp; tax, fix&nbsp; the&nbsp; license&nbsp; fee. and regulate the&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * storage&nbsp; and sale of&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * petroleum or any&nbsp; of&nbsp; the products thereof&nbsp; and of all other&nbsp; highly combustible or explosive materials</p></blockquote><p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p><blockquote><p>" '(<em>o</em>) To tax and fix the license fee on dealers in general merchandise *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."</p></blockquote><p>Then appellant argues that liquefied&nbsp; flammable&nbsp; gas&nbsp; is included in said paragraph (<em>m</em>) and, hence, excluded from the connotation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; word&nbsp; "merchandise," as used&nbsp; in paragraph (<em>o</em>).&nbsp; This&nbsp; argument at first impressed the court, but, upon further reflection, we are persuaded that it is not decisive on the issue before us.&nbsp; Indeed, although the clause "petroleum or any of the&nbsp; products thereof and all other highly&nbsp; combustible&nbsp; or explosive&nbsp; material," appearing&nbsp; in said paragraph&nbsp; (<em>m</em>)&nbsp; may indicate the intent of <em>Congress of the Philippines</em> to include liquefied flammable gas within the purview of said paragraph, it does not follow necessarily that in using the word&nbsp; "merchandise", in Municipal Ordinance No. 1925, as amended, the <em>Municipal Board of Manila</em> intended to convey thereto the restricted meaning allegedly given to the term "merchandise"&nbsp; in paragarph&nbsp; (<em>o</em>)&nbsp; of Section&nbsp; 18 of its Revised Charter, or to exclude liquefied flammable gas from the operation of said ordinance.&nbsp; In this connection,&nbsp; it should be noted that the authority of the City of Manila to&nbsp; tax&nbsp; dealers in liquefied&nbsp; flammable gas under its Revised Charter,&nbsp; is conceded.&nbsp; Accordingly, the question whether the grant&nbsp; of power appears in paragraph&nbsp; (<em>m</em>)&nbsp; or&nbsp; in paragraph (<em>o</em>)&nbsp; of the aforementioned Section 18, is immaterial to the exercise of said authority.</p><p>As already adverted to, the case hinges on the connotation of the term "merchandise" as used&nbsp; in said ordinance, or the interest of the Municipal Board in connection therewith. Referring to the meaning of said word,&nbsp; Corpus Juris Secundum has the following to say:</p><blockquote><p>"The word 'merchandise, employed as a noun, is defined as meaning the objects of commerce;&nbsp; the&nbsp; subjects of commerce&nbsp; and&nbsp; traffic; whatever is usually bought and sold in&nbsp; trade, or market, or by merchants; goods; wares; commodities;&nbsp;&nbsp; commodities, goods,&nbsp; or wares bought and sold for gain; commodities&nbsp; or&nbsp; goods to trade with;&nbsp; a commercial commodity&nbsp; or commercial commodities in general, </p><p>"The term is also defined as meaning things which are ordinarily bought and sold;&nbsp; anything' movable, anything customarily&nbsp; bought and sold for profit; any movable object&nbsp; of trade&nbsp; or&nbsp; traffic; any article which&nbsp; is the object of commerce, or which&nbsp; may be bought or sold in trade; the staple of a mercantile business; that which is passed from hand&nbsp; to hand by purchase and sale."&nbsp; (Vol.&nbsp; 57 pp. 1056-1057.)</p></blockquote><p>Inasmuch as,&nbsp; admittedly,&nbsp; liquefied gas may&nbsp; be,&nbsp; and&nbsp; is being, bought and sold in trade,&nbsp; it clearly is a merchandise, and comes within the&nbsp; purview&nbsp; of the ordinary import of this world.&nbsp; Was it used in this sense in Ordinance No. 1925, as amended, as,&nbsp; in effect, held by the lower&nbsp; court, or did the Municipal Board intend to convey therewith the meaning allegedly given&nbsp; thereto&nbsp; in&nbsp; paragraph (<em>o</em>)&nbsp; of Section 18 of Republic Act No. 409,&nbsp; as contended by defendant-appellant?&nbsp; We find ourselves unable to accept the latter view, not only because the former is more in accord with the simple and&nbsp; usual connotation&nbsp; of said term, but, also, because it appears that said ordinance has not followed the classification&nbsp; made in&nbsp; Section 18&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 109.&nbsp; Thus, for instance, although the word "merchandise" appears in paragraph&nbsp; (<em>o</em>)&nbsp; of said Section 18, it is included in Group 2 of said ordinance, together with electrical supplies, sporting goods,&nbsp; textiles, hardwares, including glasswares, and cooking utensils, which are found in paragraph (n)&nbsp; of said Article 18.&nbsp; Moreover, said Group 2 refers to "retail dealers in&nbsp; <em>new</em>&nbsp; (not yet used) merchandise, which dealers are not yet subject to the payment of any municipal tax,<em> such as: </em>(1)&nbsp; Retail&nbsp; dealers in&nbsp; general merchandise * * *&nbsp; Obviously, the enumeration&nbsp; made in said Group 2 is not all inclusive.&nbsp; It merely illustrates some of the objects the dealers in which&nbsp; are taxed under its provision. The word "merchandise" as used therein has not restrictive meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said group taxes dealers in&nbsp; all "new&nbsp; (not yet used)&nbsp; merchandise, which dealers are not yet subject to the payment of any municipal tax."&nbsp; Liquefied flammable gas is a "new" object of commerce, and hence, merchandise, and, at the time&nbsp; of the passage of said ordinance,&nbsp; dealers therein were&nbsp; not, as yet,&nbsp; subject to&nbsp; the payment&nbsp; of any municipal tax.&nbsp; In short, the first and second assignments of error&nbsp; are untenable.</p><p>Under the third assignment of error,&nbsp; it is claimed that the tax imposed under the ordinance in question is in the nature of a percentage tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; The schedule of taxes under the aforementioned Group 2&nbsp; is a&nbsp; follows:</p><table align="center" border="0" width="90%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="27%"><div align="center">Class</div></td> <td width="27%"><div align="center">Quarterly gross sales</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="center">Quarterly license fee</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1................................... </td> <td><div align="right">Over&nbsp;
