				[ Adm. Case No. 126, October 24, 1952</h4>
				<H3>IN RE: ATTY. TRANQUILINO ROVERO <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Solicitor-General has filed the present complaint for 
disbarment against Atty. Tranquilino Rovero, on the grounds that on March 31, 
1947, "respondent Tranquilino Rovero, having been found in a final decision 
rendered by the then Insular Collector of Customs to have violated the customs 
law by fraudulently concealing a dutiable importation, was fined in an amount 
equal to three times the customs duty due on a piece of jewelry which he omitted 
to declare and which was subsequently found to be concealed in his wallet", and 
that on October 28, 1948, "respondent Tranquilino Rovero was convicted of 
smuggling by final decision of the Court of Appeals in Criminal Case No. CA-G. 
R. No. 2214-R, affirming a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
sentencing him to pay a fine of P2,500 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, said case involving a fraudulent practice against customs revenue, 
as defined and penalized by Section 2703 of the Revised Administrative Code." 
The respondent admits the existence of the decision of the Collector of Customs, 
and his conviction by the Court of Appeals, but sets up the defense that they 
are not sufficient to disqualify him from the practice of law, especially 
because the acts of which he was found guilty, while at most merely 
discreditable, had been committed by him as an individual and not in pursuance 
or in the exercise of his legal profession. 
<p align="justify">Under section 25, Rule 127, of the Rules of Court, a member of 
the bar may be removed or suspended from his office as attorney for a conviction 
of a crime involving moral turpitude, and this ground is.apart from any deceit, 
malpractice or other gross misconduct in office as lawyer. Moral turpitude 
includes any act done contrary to justice, honesty, modesty or good morals. (<span style="font-style: italic;">In 
re</span> Basa, 41 Phil. 275.)</p>
<p align="justify">Respondent's conviction of smuggling by final decision of the 
Court of Appeals certainly involves an act done contrary at least to honesty or 
good morals. The ground invoked by the Solicitor General is aggravated by the 
fact that the respondent sought to defraud, not merely a private person, but the 
Government.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the respondent Tranquilino Rovero is hereby 
disbarred from the practice of law, and he is hereby directed to surrender to 
this Court his lawyer's certificate within 10 days after this resolution shall 
have become final. </p>
<p align="justify">So ordered. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Labrador, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
