				<H3>SARAH VITO MORALES, PETITIONER-APPELLANT, VS. HON. LAURO C. MAIQUEZ, JUDGE OF THE MUNICIPAL COURT OF MANILA, BRANCH V. AND ROSA VICTORINO VDA. DE SAN JOSE, RESPONDENTS-APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner in this case is the mother of seven minor children had with Manuel 
V. San Jose without benefit of marriage, with whon she lived from April, 1937 to 
March, 1952. She recognized all her seven children publicly and openly in the 
records of the local civil registrar and had always supported them providing 
them with clothing and shelter and sending them to school, Manuel V. San Jose 
has not legally acknowledged them. By reason of trouble that arose between her 
and Manuel V. San Jose in March, 1952, she fled from the common dwelling. She 
tried to get custody of her children but only succeeded in getting that of 
Elisa, age 16, Rosa Concepcion, age 13, and Carmelita, age 4. The remaining 
four, namely, Manuel, age 14, Roberto, age 12, Alberto, age 10, and Carlos, age 
7, remained with Manuel V. San Jose.
<p>On December 21, 1953, Rosa Victorino Vda. de San Jose, Manuel V. San Jose's 
mother, instituted special proceedings No. 130 in the Municipal Court of Manila 
for the guardianship of all the above-mentioned minor children. Petitioner 
herein filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that the 
Municipal Court of Manila has no jurisdiction of the subject matter of the 
action but the said Municipal Court denied her petition. Petitioner herein filed 
a petition for certiorari in the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case 
No, 2173), asking for the annulment of the order of the Municipal Court in the 
above-mentioned special proceedings No, 130. This notion was denied, so 
petitioner has presented an appeal directly to this Court.</p>
<p>The question squarely brought before Us is whether the municipal court has 
jurisdiction of a guardianship proceeding, union does not involve any property 
or funds and which is limited to the custody of the person of minors. The above 
question involves the interpretation of the provisions of Republic Acts Nos. 643 
and 644, which amended the Judiciary Act of 1948, both approved on June 12, 
1950} the pertinent provisions of which are as follows :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">REPUBLIC ACT NO. 643</p>
<p align="center">X X X X</p>
<p>"Section 1. Section ninety of Republic Act Numbered Two Hundred and 
ninety-six is hereby amended to read as follows :</p>
<p>" 'Sec. 90. <u>Concurrent jurisdiction to appoint guardians</u>.- Justices of 
the peace and judges of municipal courts of chartered cities shall have 
concurrent jurisdiction with courts of first instance to appoint guardians or 
guardians ad litem for persons who are incapacitated by being of minor age or 
mentally incapable in matters within their respective jurisdiction.'</p>
<p>"Sec. 2. Section one, Rule ninety-three of the Rules of Court in the 
Philippines is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>
<p>" 'Sec. 1. <u>Where to institute proceedings</u>.- Guardianship of the person 
or estate of a minor or incompetent shall be originally cognizable by the Court 
of First Instance of the province where the minor or inconpetent resides, and if 
he resides in a foreign country, by the Court of First Instance of the province 
wherein his property or part thereof is situated: <u>Provided</u>, 
<u>however</u>, that the justice of the peace courts or municipal courts of 
chartered cities, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the court of first 
instance in cases where the value of the property of such minor or incompetent 
falls within the jurisdiction of the latter courts.' "</p>
<p align="center">REPUBLIC ACT NO. 644</p>
<p align="center">X X X X</p>
<p>"Section 1. Section eighty-six of Republic Act Numbered Two hundred and 
ninety-six is hereby amended to read as follows :</p>
<p>"'Sec. 86. <u>Jurisdiction of justices of the peace and judges of municipal 
courts of chartered cities</u>.- The jurisdiction of justices of the peace and 
judges of municipal courts of chartered cities shall consist of :</p>
<p align="center">X X X X</p>
<p>"'(c) The last phrase of paragraph (e) of section forty-three of this Act, 
notwithstanding, justices of the peace and judges of municipal courts shall have 
concurrent jurisdiction with the Courts of First Instance in the appointment of 
guardians and adoption cases.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>The claim of the petitioner is that the phrase "in matters, within their 
respective jurisdiction" contained in Section 90 of the Judiciary Acts as 
amended limits the jurisdiction of justice of the peace or municipal courts to 
guardianship proceedings in which the amount or value of the property involved 
is within the jurisdiction of the said justice of the peace or municipal courts, 
i.e., two thousand pesos or less. On the other hand, the respondent contends 
that the concurrent jurisdiction granted said inferior courts embraces cases in 
which the wards have no property, both the courts of first instance and the 
municipal and justice of the peace courts having concurrent jurisdiction when 
the property of the ward does not exceed two thousand pesos in value. It is also 
argued that Republic Act No, 644, which grants jurisdiction to them in cases of 
adoption and guardianship warrants the above conclusion (that the jurisdiction 
was granted in appointment of guardians when the wards have no property).</p>
<p>Republic Act No. 643 originated in the Senate as S. No. 159. In the original 
bill the term "<u>persons</u>" was substituted for the term "litigants in their 
courts" in Section 90 of the Judiciary Act of 1943, and concurrent jurisdiction 
is granted to appoint guardians or guardians <em>ad litem</em> for them 
(<u>persons</u>). Under Section 2 of the bill concurrent jurisdiction Is granted 
"in cases where the value of the property of such minor or incompetent falls 
within the jurisdiction of the latter courts." We see in these two provisions an 
evident intention to grant jurisdiction <u>over persons</u> only and when the 
guardianship involves properties of a ward when said properties are worth two 
thousand pesos or less. In the final draft approved, the phrase "involving 
amounts" contained in Section l of the original bill, S, No. 159, was 
eliminated, and the phrase "in matters within their respective jurisdiction" 
retained, The retention of this last phrase at first would seem to give the 
impression that inferior courts are granted concurrent jurisdiction only when 
the amount of the property of the ward or wards is two thousand pesos or less. 
But this is expressly covered by the next section, which already grants this 
class of jurisdiction. The phrase left in the law, "in matters within their 
respective jurisdiction," will have no possible application, if it is held to 
refer to jurisdiction over the subject matter, because there are no guardianship 
proceedings over which justice of the peace courts have jurisdiction, and the 
next section already covers guardianship cases in which the amount or value of 
the property in controversy is within the jurisdictional amount of the justice 
of the peace courts (two thousand pesos or less). On the other hand, the grant 
is with respect to <u>persons only</u>, not with respect to guardianship over 
properties of wards as in the next grant. The only inference that may be drawn 
from these circumstances is that the grant in Section 1 of Republic Act No, 643 
is as to persons only, not as to properties of wards, and the retention of the 
phrase "in matters within their respective jurisdiction" must have been 
motivated by a desire for clearness, i.e., that the jurisdiction granted is for 
the appointnent of guardians for <u>persons</u> only <u>within</u> <u>their</u> 
<u>territorial</u> <u>limits</u>. No other reasonable interpretation could be 
given thereto.</p>
<p>The above interpretation is confirmed by the enactment of Republic Act No. 
644 also amendatory to the Judiciary Act, The bill, which later became Republic 
Act no. 644 was House bill No. 812. The original bill purported to grant 
jurisdiction to justice of the peace courts in adoption cases only, but the 
final law as passed includes cases of appointment of guardians or guardians 
<em>ad litem</em>. The amendment (grant of jurisdiction in the appointnent of 
guardians and adoption cases) was inserted in the general provision granting 
jurisdiction to supplement and complement the express grant in Republic Act No. 
643. The grant of concurrent jurisdiction in the appointment of guardians of 
persons is perfectly justifiable. If justice of the peace or municipal courts 
are considered fully qualified to take cognizance of adoption cases, which 
involve custody of persons resulting in changes of family relationship, they 
should also be qualified to take cognizance of guardianship cases where custody 
only is involved. Furthermore, guardianship proceedings are temporary in nature 
only, during minority of the ward, and are different fron adoption cases which 
occasion final and lasting consequences in family relationships, and the 
legislature evidently desired the grant of jurisdiction in both cases.</p>
<p>The petition is denied, with costs against petitioner.</p>
