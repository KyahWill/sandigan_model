				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Roberta Diaz y Cruz is an old woman, 83 years of age, residing in Pasay City 
and possessing real and personal properties roughly estimated at half a million 
pesos.<p></p>
<p>On August 18, 1956, three of her nine legitimate children, and two of her 
grandchildren by another daughter, joined in a petition addressed to the Rizal 
Court of First Instance, to declare her incompetent to take care of herself and 
manage her properties and to appoint a guardian of her person and her 
properties. The allegations, too long to relate, set out a <i>prima facie</i> case of 
incompetency<span class="style1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span> </sup></span>(Special Proceeding 
1483-P).</p>
<p>On November 7, 1956, while the above special proceeding was pending hearing 
before respondent Judge Jesus Y. Perez, Roberta Diaz y Cruz received from the 
Register of Deeds of Rizal a letter advising her that by reason of said 
proceedings, a notice of <i>lis pendens</i> had been annotated on her Transfer 
Certificate of Title to real property No. 32872 of that Province.</p>
<p>Wherefore, on November 29, 1956, she filed in the above-mentioned proceedings 
a petition to cancel the <i>lis pendens</i>. In view of the opposition of the adverse 
parties, the respondent judge denied the petition. Her motion to reconsider 
having failed, Roberta Diaz filed a notice of appeal, record on appeal, and 
appeal bond.</p>
<p>But on January 22, 1957, the respondent judge disapproved the record on 
appeal, holding the appealed orders to be interlocutory, and therefore not 
appealable.</p>
<p>So on February 26, 1957, this petition for mandamus and <i>certiorari </i>was filed 
in this Court. The first, to compel approval of the record on appeal; the 
second, to annul the order refusing cancellation of the notice of <i>lis 
pendens</i>.</p>
<p>We think mandamus does not lie. As the respondent judge said, the order was 
interlocutory, which can not "be the subject of appeal until final judgment is 
rendered." (Section 2, Rule 41.) It is comparable with an order refusing to 
annul a preliminary attachment<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> or an 
order denying or granting a preliminary injunction<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> which have been held to be interlocutory 
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
<p>As to the <i>certiorari</i>, petitioner may not seriously urge lack of jurisdiction. 
In asking the Court to annul the <i>lis pendens</i> she admitted its jurisdiction to 
annul and also to refuse annulment.</p>
<p>Was there abuse of discretion? The <i>lis pendens</i> had been obviously annotated 
for the purpose of advising any one who might wish to buy the realty, that there 
is in court a petition to declare Roberta Diaz incompetent to dispose of her 
properties so that such purchaser may make the necessary inquiries and take 
steps to protect his interest, bearing in mind that if said Roberta Diaz should 
be declared incompetent, his purchase will be or might be affected 
adversely.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> It is a proper cautionary 
measure which the courts should be slow to disturb, unless the petition for 
guardianship was <i>prima facie</i> unconvincing, or was not made in good faith, or as 
alleged by petitioner here, the pendency of guardianship proceedings may not be 
considered as <i>lis pendens</i> affecting the realties of the person allegedly 
incompetent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The effect of filing a notice of <i>lis pendens</i> is to charge the stranger with 
notice of the particular litigations referred to in the notice; and if the 
notice is effective, a third party who acquires the property affected by the <i>lis 
pendens</i> takes subject to the eventuality of the litigations."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And its purpose is "to hold property within the jurisdiction and control of 
the court pending determination of the controversy, thereby preventing third 
persons from acquiring such interests therein as would preclude giving effect to 
the judgment."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>In the light of the object and salutory effects of the notation, we see no 
reason to declare it improper in this case, specially because the allegations of 
the guardianship petition specified instances wherein the incompetent disposed 
of her properties in favor of persons allegedly taking undue advantage of her 
advanced age and weak mental and physical condition.</p>
<p>The argument is presented that sec. 79 of Act No. 496 and sec. 24 of Rule 7 
indicate the cases wherein <i>lis pendens</i> may be annotated, and that guardianship 
proceedings is not included therein. In the first place sec. 79 is not an 
exclusive enumeration. In the second place, these proceedings affect "the use" 
or possession of the real estate within the meaning of above sections, even "the 
title", in the sense that the proceedings will curtail or take away the right of 
the owner to dispose of the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is to be doubted whether the above sections were intended to be 
exclusive of other circumstances wherein equity and general convenience would 
make <i>lis pendens</i> appropriate. Indeed, cases have held it to be proper in 
receivership proceedings<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span> involving 
realty, and in lunacy proceedings<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> 
situations closely akin to the instant litigation.</p>
<p>In this connection, it is insisted that both sections only apply to "actions" 
which are different from "special proceedings", like guardianship. It is enough 
to point out that the Rules provided for civil actions are generally applicable 
to special proceedings. (Rule 73, section 2.)</p>
<p>Lastly, we are advised that after hearing the petition the lower court found 
in April 1957 that by reason of her advanced age and weak mind, Roberta Diaz 
could not manage her properties-she does not even remember them-and needed a 
guardian to help administer her interests. This, in a way, vindicates the 
annotation and the court's refusal to cancel it.</p>
<p>Clearly then no abuse was made of the court's discretion. Petition denied, 
with costs.</p>
