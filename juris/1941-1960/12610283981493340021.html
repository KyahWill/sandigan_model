				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal, taken&nbsp; by Dolores&nbsp; Lopez&nbsp; Vda. de Jison, the Heirs of Albino Jison and the Heirs of Joaquina Alboro, from a decision of the Court of Appeals dismissing their petition for a writ of mandamus to enjoin respondent Hon. Francisco Arellano, as&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; of First Instance of Negros Occidental, to certify the&nbsp; joint record on&nbsp; appeal filed, by said petitioners,&nbsp; in Cadastral Case No. 27 of said province, G.L.R.O. No. 284, in connection with the decision therein rendered as regards lots Nos.&nbsp; 606,&nbsp; 609,&nbsp; 610, 631 and 818 of the Cadastre&nbsp; of Sagay,&nbsp; Negros Occidental.<br><br>The only question raised in&nbsp; this&nbsp; action is whether or not petitioners' appeal from said decision of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Negros&nbsp; Occidental has been perfected in due time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pertinent facts are not disputed.<br><br>On October&nbsp; 17, 1952,&nbsp; said Court of&nbsp; First Instance rendered decision, penned by Honorable Lorenzo C.&nbsp; Garlitos, Judge,&nbsp; adjudicating&nbsp; said&nbsp; lots to&nbsp; respondents herein, the spouses Dominador Lacson and&nbsp; Visitacion Lacson.&nbsp; Notice of this decision was received by the petitioners, as claimants of said lots, on November 17,1952.&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty-one days later, or on December&nbsp; 8, 1952, petitioners gave the corresponding&nbsp; notice of appeal.&nbsp; On December 12,&nbsp; 1952, they asked permission to file a joint record&nbsp; on appeal.&nbsp; Leave of absence&nbsp; having been taken by Judge Garlitos,&nbsp; during the Christmas of 1952,&nbsp; said request was not acted upon until January 10, 1953, when said Judge issued an order authorizing petitioners "to&nbsp; file and&nbsp; submit for approval&nbsp; a joint record on appeal within the&nbsp; reglementary period as required by&nbsp; law."&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy&nbsp; of this border was, on February 19,&nbsp; 1958, served upon petitioners'&nbsp; counsel, who filed said joint record&nbsp; on appeal, and the&nbsp; corresponding appeal bond, immediately thereafter,&nbsp; or on February. 20,&nbsp; 1953. Respondents&nbsp; Dominador and Visitacion Lacson, later objected to the approval of said joint record on appeal&nbsp; and moved for&nbsp; the dismissal of petitioners' appeals, upon the&nbsp; ground that said&nbsp; joint&nbsp; record&nbsp; on appeal&nbsp; and&nbsp; the appeal&nbsp; bond had been&nbsp; filed beyond&nbsp; the reglementary period.&nbsp; This pretense, was overruled&nbsp; by&nbsp; Judge Garlitos in&nbsp; an order dated&nbsp; April 23,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after,&nbsp; said&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; ceased, however, to preside the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, and respondent Judge, Hon. Francisco Arellano, to whom&nbsp; the case had,&nbsp; meanwhile, been assigned,&nbsp; reconsidered said order and&nbsp; dismissed the appeal, on motion of Dominador&nbsp; and Visitacion Lacson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, petitioners instituted the present action,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, for the&nbsp; purpose of compelling said respondent Judge, by&nbsp; mandamus, to approve and certify the&nbsp; aforementioned joint record on appeal.&nbsp; The case is now&nbsp; before us on&nbsp; appeal from the decision&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals dismissing said petition for mandamus, with costs against the petitioners.<br><br>At the outset,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; seems&nbsp; to have been&nbsp; under&nbsp; the impression&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioners' motion for permission to submit a joint record&nbsp; on appeal&nbsp; had been filed on January 10, 1953, inasmuch as the&nbsp; decision of said Court&nbsp; states:<br><blockquote>"It appears&nbsp; that petitioners, among the&nbsp; five different claimants, filed answer&nbsp; for&nbsp; said&nbsp; lots.&nbsp; Their claim&nbsp; was&nbsp; adversely&nbsp; decided and, having received notice&nbsp; of the decision on1 November 17, 1952, they filed notice of&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; on&nbsp; December&nbsp; 12, 1952.&nbsp; On&nbsp; January 10,&nbsp; 1953, they filed&nbsp; a motion asking the court&nbsp; to allow&nbsp; them&nbsp; to the&nbsp; a&nbsp; joint record on appeal together&nbsp; with the&nbsp; other&nbsp; appellants. (Italics supplied.) <br></blockquote>Obviously, the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals to the effect that the appeal had not been perfected within the reglementary period would be&nbsp; correct if the foregoing narration were accurate.&nbsp; Over&nbsp; fifty (50)&nbsp; days&nbsp; having elapsed from November&nbsp; 17, 1952—when&nbsp; petitioners received notice of the decision of the Court of First Instance —to January 10, 1953, said decision-would&nbsp; have been final several weeks prior&nbsp; to the date last mentioned,&nbsp; had the motion for authority to submit&nbsp; a joint&nbsp; record&nbsp; on appeal not been filed prior thereto.<br><br>However, the very&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals quotes, in support thereof, the order of Judge&nbsp; Garlitos of January 10, 1953, which indicates—and respondents admit —that said motion was filed on December 12, 1952.&nbsp; Moreover, , said&nbsp; decision of the Court of Appeals significantly states, quite inaccurately,&nbsp; that petitioners had given notice of their&nbsp; intention to&nbsp; appeal on December&nbsp; 12, 1952, although the record shows,&nbsp; and&nbsp; respondents admit,&nbsp; that said notice was filed&nbsp; on&nbsp; December 8, 1952.&nbsp; These&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; suggest,&nbsp; to our mind, that the dismissal of the petition for mandamus by the Court of Appeals was prompted mainly by its erroneous belief that&nbsp; the motion for permission to submit a joint record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; had been filed on January&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1953, and&nbsp; that what petitioners had attached&nbsp; to the&nbsp; record on December&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; was, not said&nbsp; motion,&nbsp; but&nbsp; their&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of appeal.&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact, however, said motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed on December&nbsp; 12, 1952— or five (5) days before the&nbsp; expiration of the reglementary period to perfect the appeal—the notice of appeal having been&nbsp; recorded four&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; days before, or on December 8, 1952.<br><br>It is urged that the filing of said motion did not suspend&nbsp; the running of&nbsp; the period to .perfect the&nbsp; appeal; that an extension of&nbsp; said period was&nbsp; not asked&nbsp; in said motion;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court, in its&nbsp; order of January 10, 1953, merely authorized the filing of said joint record on appeal&nbsp; "within the reglementary period,"&nbsp; which, respondent&nbsp; contend, expired on December&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1952; that said order&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; extend&nbsp; the&nbsp; period&nbsp; within which to perfect the&nbsp; appeal; and that petitioners should have filed, therefore, their joint record on appeal on or 'before December 17, 1952.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; herein maintain that they could not have done so after the filing of said motion&nbsp; on, December&nbsp; 12, 1952 and until receipt of notice of the order of&nbsp; January 10, 1953, granting said motion.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; consideration of the&nbsp; circumstances surrounding the case,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion that&nbsp; petitioners'&nbsp; appeal had been&nbsp; seasonably&nbsp; perfected.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; begin&nbsp; with,&nbsp; if,&nbsp; as respondents&nbsp; contend,&nbsp; the party seeking an&nbsp; extension of time may&nbsp; not assume that the same&nbsp; would be&nbsp; granted, petitioners herein were,&nbsp; by the same&nbsp; token, not entitled to take&nbsp; it for. granted that their motion for authority to file a joint record on appeal would merit favorable&nbsp; action.'' Hence, they&nbsp; cannot be said to be&nbsp; under legal obligation to file said joint record&nbsp; on appeal pending&nbsp; the granting of said&nbsp; motion.<br><br>Again,&nbsp; the&nbsp; question whether or&nbsp; not&nbsp; the&nbsp; presentation of a joint record on&nbsp; appeal shall&nbsp; be authorized, is principally&nbsp; addressed to&nbsp; the sound discretion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court, to be exercised&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; light&nbsp; of the&nbsp; condition&nbsp; obtaining in&nbsp; each&nbsp; case.&nbsp; In&nbsp; connection therewith, Judge&nbsp; Garlitos said in his order of April 23,&nbsp; 1953:<br><blockquote>"This Court was aware of the&nbsp; shuttling- back&nbsp; and forth of&nbsp; the records of&nbsp; this case from the Office of the&nbsp; Clerk of&nbsp; Court in&nbsp; Bacolod City to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Municipality of Escalante, Negros&nbsp; Occidental, at which latter place this&nbsp; Court had&nbsp; been&nbsp; holding sessions&nbsp; in connection&nbsp; "with Cadastral Cases&nbsp; involving&nbsp;&nbsp; lots&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Escalante Cadastre.&nbsp;&nbsp; The said Municipality is 102 kilometers&nbsp; away from&nbsp; the City of Bacolod, and&nbsp; that there were times&nbsp; when&nbsp; the records of this&nbsp; case were&nbsp; brought&nbsp; to&nbsp; Esealante&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; then returned to&nbsp; the City of Bacolod and' vice-versa,&nbsp; making it thereby really hard&nbsp; and inconvenient for the parties-claimants to perfect their Record on Appeal due to the unavailability&nbsp; of the records&nbsp; of this&nbsp; case to the attorneys&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; claimants-appellants&nbsp; who&nbsp; are all residents of Bacolod&nbsp; City.&nbsp; The Court is&nbsp; also aware of&nbsp; the circumstance that this&nbsp; is a&nbsp; case involving reconstitution&nbsp; of the records which have been destroyed during&nbsp; the war as well&nbsp; as the hearing of the many witnesses of&nbsp; the claimants which made&nbsp; the record voluminous as to necessitate a longer period&nbsp; of time for the&nbsp; preparation of the Joint Record&nbsp; on&nbsp; Appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court having&nbsp; been conscious of these&nbsp; facts, acting&nbsp; within the&nbsp; proper bounds&nbsp; of both, justice and&nbsp; equity, and in&nbsp; the exercise of its sound discretion, had&nbsp; to be liberal in&nbsp; granting extensions&nbsp; of time to&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; concerned to enable them to&nbsp; file&nbsp; their&nbsp; Records on Appeal."<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"The records, likewise, disclose that the heirs of Raymuhdo Tupaa received&nbsp; the copy of the decision&nbsp; rendered by this&nbsp; Court on November&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 3952; that&nbsp; on November 26,&nbsp; 1952, . the&nbsp; corresponding Notice of Appeal&nbsp; dated&nbsp; November&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1952, was filed&nbsp; by the said heirs;&nbsp; that on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; expiration of&nbsp; the original&nbsp; thirty-day period, the&nbsp; heirs of&nbsp; Raymundo Tupas prayed for an extension of time which was&nbsp; granted by the Court as may be&nbsp; seen in&nbsp; its order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; November&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; allowing&nbsp; them fifteen&nbsp; (15)&nbsp; days extension&nbsp; within which to file their Record on Appeal; that on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 12th day of December,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of Albino&nbsp; Jison&nbsp; and the heirs&nbsp; of Joaquina&nbsp; Alboro prayed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Joint&nbsp; Record on&nbsp; Appeal&nbsp; with the&nbsp; other&nbsp; claimants-appellants be affected; that on January 10, 1953, after the undersigned&nbsp; presiding this Court&nbsp; had returned from Manila after a&nbsp; leave of absence of&nbsp; fifteen (15) days, the Court resolved the aforesaid&nbsp; petition and authorized the heirs of Albino Jison&nbsp; and the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; Joaquina Alboro to file and submit&nbsp; for&nbsp; approval a Joint&nbsp; Record on Appeal within the reglementary period&nbsp; as required by law;&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; order was received by the&nbsp; heirs of&nbsp; Albino&nbsp; Jison, Dolores&nbsp; L. Vda. de Jison and the heirs of&nbsp; Joaquina&nbsp; Alboro on the 19th day of&nbsp; February 1953;&nbsp; that on the other hand the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; Raymundo Tupas filed on&nbsp; January 14,&nbsp; 1953, a pleading entitled "Confirmity to the Motion of&nbsp; Dolores Lopez&nbsp; Vda. de Jison for the&nbsp; Joint&nbsp; Record on Appeal and a Motion which prayed among&nbsp; other things that the parties submit their&nbsp; Record&nbsp; on Appeal&nbsp; which&nbsp; was acted&nbsp; upon by this Court&nbsp; on January 23,&nbsp; 1953, and a copy of which was received by the heirs of Raymundo&nbsp; Tupas&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; 3rd day of February&nbsp; 1953; that in the said order&nbsp; this Court authorized the heirs of Raymundo Tupas to&nbsp; withdraw their record&nbsp; on appeal and in&nbsp; lieu thereof the parties&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; were thereby enjoined&nbsp; to&nbsp; submit their&nbsp; Joint Record on Appeal within the&nbsp; reglementary&nbsp; period&nbsp; as&nbsp; required by law; and,&nbsp; that&nbsp; on the 20th day&nbsp; of&nbsp; February,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the heirs of Raymundo Tupas, the heirs of Albino Jison, Dolores&nbsp; L. Vda. de Jison and the Heirs of&nbsp; Joaquina&nbsp; Alboro submitted their Joint Record on&nbsp; Appeal together&nbsp; with their&nbsp; appeal bond.<br><br>"On the&nbsp; strength,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the facts mentioned above&nbsp; and after a mature perusal of the&nbsp; pleadings of the&nbsp; parties concerned as well as the oral arguments of their lawyers,&nbsp; the Court is of the considered judgment, and it so holds, that the motion to dismiss&nbsp; the Appeals submitted by the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of Raymundo Tupas, the heirs&nbsp; of Albino Jison, Dolores L. Vda. de&nbsp; Jison and the heirs of Joaquina Alboro is without merit, and&nbsp; it is, therefore, hereby overruled.'"<br></blockquote>These facts and&nbsp; the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp;&nbsp; drawn therefrom&nbsp; by Judge Garlitos&nbsp; strongly&nbsp; suggest&nbsp; that&nbsp; said Judge issued his order of January 10,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; intention, either of&nbsp; suspending the running of the&nbsp; period to file&nbsp; the record on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp;&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; pendency&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioners'&nbsp; motion of December 12, 1952, or of granting., petitioners herein, from notice of said order of January 10,&nbsp; 1953, an additional time, for the filing of said joint&nbsp; record on appeal, equivalent to the portion of the reglementary period which had&nbsp; not expired&nbsp; at the time of&nbsp; the filing of said motion. In view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing, and&nbsp; considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; the joint record on&nbsp; appeal and the appeal bond were filed the day immediately following receipt of the notice aforementioned, and that the Rules of Court should be construed liberally,&nbsp; in&nbsp; order that litigants may .'have a reasonable opportunity to defend and enforce their substantive rights (Rule 1,&nbsp; section 2,&nbsp; Rules of Court), the decision of the Court of Appeals should be, as it is hereby, reversed,&nbsp; and let the writ of mandamus prayed for be issued, with costs against&nbsp; respondents Dominador Lacspn and Visitation Lacson.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C.
