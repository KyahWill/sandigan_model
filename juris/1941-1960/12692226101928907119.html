				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for habeas corpus based upon the following 
facts:
<p align="justify">On various dates between February 18 and May 14, 1948, the 
petitioner was convicted of estafa in seventeen criminal cases and sentenced by 
final judgments of the Court of First Instance of Manila to an aggregate penalty 
of 6 years, 4 months, and 26 days of imprisonment, to indemnify the offended 
parties in various sums aggregating P43,436.45, with subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency in each case, and to pay the costs. The most severe of the 
seventeen sentences against the petitioner was 6 months and 1 day of <i>prision 
correccional</i> plus an indemnity of P8,000, with subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency, and the costs. He commenced to serve these sentences on 
February 18, 1948. </p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner contends:</p>
<p align="justify">(<i>a</i>) That under section 70 of the Revised Penal Code the 
maximum duration of his sentence cannot exceed threefold the length of time 
corresponding to the most severe of the penalties imposed upon him, that is to 
say, 18 months and 3 days;</p>
<p align="justify">(<i>b</i>) That the application of the threefold rule does not 
preclude his enjoyment of the deduction from his sentence of 5 days for each 
month of good behavior as provided in paragraph 1 of article 97 of the Revised 
Penal Code;</p>
<p align="justify">(<i>c</i>) That with such deduction his aggregate penalty 
should be only 15 months,and 3 days, and that therefore he should have been 
discharged from custody on June 3, 1949; and</p>
<p align="justify">(<i>d</i>) That the subsidiary imprisonment should be 
eliminated because article 70 provides that "no other penalty to which he may be 
liable shall be inflicted after the sum total of those imposed equals the said 
maximum period."</p>
<ol><li>We sustain petitioner's contentions (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) above set 
forth upon the threefold rule provided in article 70 of the Revised Penal Code, 
as amended by section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 217, and the decisions of this 
court in numerous cases. (People <i>vs</i>. Garalde, 50 Phil., 823; Torres 
<i>vs</i>. Superintendent of San Ramon Prison and Penal Farm, 58 Phil., 847, and 
cases therein cited.)<br><br>
</li><li>The important question to decide here is whether the subsidiary imprisonment 
should be eliminated from the penalty imposed upon the petitioner as reduced to 
thrice the duration of the gravest penalty imposed on him in accordance with 
article 70. </li></ol>
<p align="justify">The pertinent provision of said article reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Notwithstanding the provisions of the rule next preceding, the 
maximum duration of the convict's sentence shall not be more than threefold the 
length of time corresponding to the most severe of the penalties imposed upon 
him. No other penalty to which he may be liable shall be inflicted after the sum 
total of those imposed equals the said maximum period."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Article 100 says that every person criminally liable for a 
felony is also civilly liable.</p>
<p align="justify">Articles 38 and 39 provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">"Art. 38. <i>Pecuniary Liabilities</i>.—<i>Order of 
Payment</i>.—In case the property of the offender should not be sufficient for 
the payment of all his pecuniary liabilities, the same shall be met in the 
following order:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. The reparation of the damage caused.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. Indemnification of consequential damages.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. The fine.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. The costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p align="justify">"Art. 39. <i>Subsidiary Penalty</i>.—If the convict has no 
property with which to meet the pecuniary liabilities mentioned in paragraphs 
1st, 2nd, and 3rd of the next preceding article, he shall be subject to a 
subsidiary personal liability at the rate of one day for each 2 pesos and 50 
centavos, subject to the following rules:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. If the principal penalty imposed be <i>prision 
correccional</i> or <i>arresto</i> and fine, he shall remain under confinement 
until his fine and pecuniary liabilities referred in the preceding paragraph are 
satisfied, but his subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed one-third of the 
term of the sentence, and in no case shall it continue for more than one year, 
and no fraction or part of a day shall be counted against the prisoner.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. When the principal penalty imposed be only a fine, the 
subsidiary imprisonment shall not exceed six months, if the culprit shall have 
been prosecuted for a grave or less grave felony, and shall not exceed fifteen 
days, if for a light felony.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. When the principal penalty imposed is higher than prisi6n 
correccional no subsidiary, imprisonment shall be imposed upon the culprit.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. If the principal penalty imposed is not to be executed by 
confinement in a penal institution, but such penalty is of fixed duration, the 
convict, during the period of time established in the preceding rules, shall 
continue to suffer the same deprivations as those of which the principal penalty 
consists.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. The subsidiary personal liability which the convict may 
have suffered by reason of his insolvency shall not relieve him from reparation 
of the damage caused, nor from indemnification for the consequential damages in 
case his financial circumstances should improve; but he shall be relieved from 
pecuniary liability as to the fine."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the case of People vs. Garalde, <i>supra</i>, the accused 
was sentenced in several cases for the crime of estafa thru falsification of 
commercial documents, and his aggregate penalty was reduced to threefold the 
most severe of the penalties, which was 8 years and 1 day of <i>prision 
mayor</i>. The Judgment in that case contained the following proviso: "Provided, 
however, that in case of insolvency, by analogy, he is not to suffer subsidiary 
imprisonment, since his imprisonment would be in excess of thrice the duration 
of the gravest penalty imposed on him."</p>
<p align="justify">That judgment is invoked by the petitioner herein in support of 
his contention that he should not be made to suffer subsidiary imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">It will be noted, however, that in that case the principal 
penalty imposed was higher than <i>prision correccional</i>, and therefore the 
accused was exempt from subsidiary imprisonment in accordance with paragraph 3 
of article 39 hereinabove quoted. That, in our opinion, should have been the 
reason stated by the court in that case for exempting the accused from 
subsidiary imprisonment.</p>
<p align="justify">Subsidiary imprisonment forms part of the penalty and its 
imposition is required by article 39 in case of insolvency of the accused to 
meet the pecuniary liabilities mentioned in the first three paragraphs of 
article 38; it cannot be eliminated under article 70 so long as the principal 
penalty is not higher than 6 years of imprisonment. The provision of article 70 
that "no other penalty to which he may be liable shall be inflicted after the 
sum total of those imposed equals the said maximum period," simply means that 
the convict shall not serve the excess over the maximum of threefold the most 
severe penalty. For instance, if the aggregate of the principal penalties is six 
years and that is reduced to two years under the threefold rule of article 70, 
he shall not be required to serve the remaining four years.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Jose Arlinda vs. Director of Prisons, G. R. No. 
47326, this court, by a resolution dated March 18, 1940, held that the 
contention of the petitioner that in applying the threefold rule the court 
should not have taken into account the indemnity of P498 or its corresponding 
subsidiary imprisonment was without merit, "for an Indemnity, to all intents and 
purposes, is considered a penalty, although pecuniary in character, in Title 
Three of the Revised Penal Code, so much so that it is reducible in terms of 
imprisonment at the rate of one day for each 2 pesos and 50 centavos should the 
offender turn out to be insolvent (article 39, Revised Penal Code); that, 
moreover, the indemnity which a person is sentenced to pay forms an integral 
part of the penalty, it being expressly provided by article 100 of the Revised 
Penal Code that 'every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly 
liable'; that, finally, article 70 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by 
Commonwealth Act No. 217, in limiting the prisoner's penalty to not more than 
threefold the length of the most severe penalty imposed upon him, makes no 
distinction between the principal penalty and subsidiary imprisonment."</p>
<p align="justify">We note, however, that in the case just above cited the highest 
penalty which formed the basis of the computation under the threefold rule was 4 
years, 2 months, and 1 day of imprisonment plus an indemnity of P498 and that 
the court added the equivalent of the indemnity in terms of subsidiary 
imprisonment, namely, 6 months and 19 days, to the principal penalty of 4 years, 
2 months, and 1 day and multiplied the sum by 3, with the result that 
petitioner's aggregate penalty was fixed at 14 years and 2 months of 
imprisonment, instead of multiplying the principal penalty (without the 
subsidiary imprisonment) by 3, and requiring the convict to pay the indemnity, 
for which he should not have been made to suffer subsidiary imprisonment in case 
of insolvency in view of the fact that the aggregate of the principal penalties 
as reduced under article 70 exceeded 6 years of imprisonment. We think it was 
error to add the subsidiary imprisonment to the principal penalty at the outset 
for the purpose of applying the threefold rule, because the imposition of 
subsidiary imprisonment is conditioned on the insolvency of the convict and the 
latter is required to serve it only when he fails or is unable to pay the 
indemnity.</p>
<p align="justify">We hold that the correct rule is to multiply the highest 
principal penalty by 3 and the result will be the aggregate principal penalty 
which the prisoner has to serve, plus the payment of all the indemnities which 
he has been sentenced to pay, with or without subsidiary imprisonment depending 
upon whether or not the principal penalty exceeds 6 years.</p>
<p align="justify">Applying that rule to the instant case, we find that the 
maximum duration of the principal penalty which the herein petitioner has to 
serve under his convictionn in the 17 cases in question is threefold of 6 months 
and 1 day, or 18 months and 3 days, it being understood that he shall be 
required to pay to the offended parties the indemnities aggregating P43,436.45, 
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency which shall not exceed one 
third of the principal penalty. Assuming that the petitioner will not be able to 
pay the indemnity, the maximum duration of his imprisonment shall be 18 months 
and 3 days of principal penalty plus 6 months and 1 day of subsidiary 
imprisonment, or a total of 2 years and 4 days.</p>
<p align="justify">It appearing that the petitioner has not yet served his 
sentence as above reduced, even with good conductm time allowance, the petition 
is denied, without any finding as to costs.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes,</i>
