				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Bienvenido  Umali, Angel  Escala and Anastacio  Lontok were charged with the murder  of Manuel Ramos before the  Court of  First  Instance of  Oriental  Mindoro.  As Lontok had escaped  from  the municipal  jail  of Pola, Oriental Mindoro, the corresponding preliminary investigation was conducted only  as  regards Umali and Escala. Upon  motion of  the fiscal, the  case  was  dismissed  as regards  Escala so that he may be utilized as government witness.   After due  trial, the court found  Umali guilty of  the crime  charged and was sentenced to  <em>reclusion</em> <em>perpetua</em>, there being neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance  present in  the  commission of  the  crime. Said accused  was also ordered to pay  the heirs of  the deceased the sum of P6,000 as indemnity and the costs. He was  however  credited with one-half of the time he was under preventive imprisonment.   From the decision, Umali  has appealed.</p>
<p>Sometime before December 12,  1951, Bienvenido Umali and his wife Sara Jandusay were living in  barrio Dayap, Pola, Oriental Mindoro, together  with Anastacio Lontok his godson, and Angel Escala both of which used to work for him.   Their marital life was not quite happy for they frequently quarreled.   One of those quarrels took place in their house on December 12, 1951  when Umali, suspicious that his  wife was maintaining illicit relations  with  his uncle Manuel Ramos,  laid  hands on her.  After telling his wife that he would go and talk to his uncle Ramos, known as "Tio Tawi", he left accompanied by Anastacio Lontok and Angel Escala.   Umali  armed himself  with a sub-machine gun while Lontok  was provided with a big  club two  and one-half feet long.  Escala was unarmed.  On their way from barrio Dayap to barrio Buhay na Tubig, Umali  informed his  companions of  his plan to  waylay Manuel Ramos, his uncle, and  forwith instructed them  to hit him with the  club at the first  available opportunity.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the house  of Ramos, Umali called him by his nickname telling him to come down for a brief talk.  Ramos was at the time fixing the floor of his house and, when he heard the call, he went down  with his bolo tucked  to his waist.  After Ramos had gone down, Umali invited him to a  place  nearby following a  small  trail covered by trees and shrubs.  When  the four  reached a place 30 meters away from the house, Lontok struck Ramos on the forehead three  times  making him whirl around, and when he tried to defend himself by pulling his bolo, Lontok embraced him at which juncture Umali hit Ramos witn the butt of his gun.  Escala out of fear tried to run but was prevented by Umali who threatened to shoot him and, obeying IJmali, Escala landed also a thrust on Ramos with a balisong  knife  which was  given  him  by Umali. And to complete his dastardly work, Umali took the bolo of  Ramos and with it  hit him  several times.   Then the three left in a hurry towards the beach where Umali saw Fabian Mayo, a  copra  maker, and ordered him to take them in a banca to barrio Dayap.  Mayo, who was frightened, did as bidden and on the way  he noticed that the clothes of the three were stained  with blood.  While in the  banca Umali told  Mayo that they had  just  killed Ramos.  When the party reached the shore,  Umali took Mayo to his house  and  warned him on pain of death not to reveal what he had just learned about the incident. In the afternoon of the same day, Nieves Catoy, wife of the victim, was informed by a  boy that her husband was lying dead oil a spot 30 meters  away.   The dead body was brought to town where an autopsy was made by Dr. Galicano A. Divino, a  physician  of  the Maternity  and Charity Clinic,  The autopsy  revealed that the deceased Teceived fifteen wounds,  nine of which were fatal.  According  to  Dr.  Divino,  with  the  exception of the  lacerated wounds on the forehead which could have been caused by a blunt instrument, the rest were caused by a sharp cutting instrument.  Because of the wounds  caused  on the face and shoulder which pierced the thoracic pleural cavity, a severe hemorrhage developed which caused the immediate death of the deceased.</p>
<p>The main defense of appellant  is  alibi.  He tried to prove that immediately  after the elections in November, 1951 he went  to  Manila to look for a job but instead of finding one he  wooed  a woman  without revealing his married status whom he brought with him on his return to  Poja,  Oriental Mindoro,  about the end  of the same month.  On December 5, 1951, he went again to  Manila allegedly  to ask for the help of Congressman Leuterio in finding a job.  He allegedly got a job  and, to fetch his paramour, he returned to Pola in the morning of December 12, 1951, arriving there in the evening,  and at night he kept  vigil over the body  of Manuel  Ramos  which lay in state in his house.  On the following day, he was arrested by Sgt. Martinez.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this defense was made to  depend on the testimony of Agustin Narranjo and Gregorio Holgado  who, as will be  shown later, cannot but deserve little credence because of the relations they sustain with appellant which impress upon their testimony the mark  of bias and partiality.   Take the case of Agustin Narranjo.  As the evidence shows,  he  was like a  father  to  appellant, whose mother  was  Narranjo's stepdaughter.  According to Narranjo himself,  he had reared appellant from childhood  and  had supported him in his studies, and even then, he  admitted that at  the  time the crime was committed he  had not seen appellant in Manila but only presumed that he must have been there for which reason the trial court found his testimony unworthy of consideration.  On the other hand, witness  Gregorio Holgado  was found to be a  bias witness because, as the evidence shows, he was an  ex-mayor of  Pola  who categorically admitted that  appellant was one  of  his political supporters.  Remarking that the defense failed to present any disinterested witness such as one who may  have seen him take the bus at  Manila to go  to Batangas, or one who may have seen him take the boat from Batangas wharf to Calapan wharf,  or  the bus from  Calapan to Pola, the trial court considered  the defense of alibi  too weak to overcome the positive, clear and satisfactory evidence  of  the prosecution  which points to him as  the planner and author through direct participation of the  death of the deceased.  We find  no reason to disturb this finding of the court<em> a quo.</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, we find the witnesses for the prosecution to be trustworthy.  Thus, Angel Escala, who was a  companion of appellant,  testified in  detail as  to  the participation the latter had in carrying out the plan  he himself hacl  engineered in the liquidation of the victim. Fabian Mayo testified  that he saw appellant and his co-accused carrying clothes stained with blood in their haste to leave the scene of the crime.   And Nieves Catoy, wife of the victim, was positive that appellant was one of those who went to her house to fetch her husband moments before his murder.  These are eyewitnesses to the incidents in which appellant had participated, and  their testimony, which points, to his positive identification,  cannot but belie and obliterate his defense of alibi.</p>
<p>As regards the motive of the crime, the evidence is very revealing.  It  has  been  established that  for  sometimes before the incident appellant and his wife had had several quarrels because of his suspicion that his  wife was carrying  illicit relations  with  his  own  uncle  Manuel Ramos which found its culmination on the fatal day when, after a violent quarrel, he laid hands on her.  This jealousy and quarrels must have some basis of truth when the defense did not deem it wise to place on the witness  stand  the wife of the  accused to  disprove them.  Nor does the fact that appellant kept vigil over the body of the victim while laying in state in his house in any way affect his liability because of the truism  that a criminal at  times makes it a point to visit his victim in a vain effort to remove any suspicion from him.</p>
<p>There is an intimation'that appellant's co-accused Anastacio Lontok in his affidavit Exhibit 3 assumed full  responsibility for the killing which fact, it is claimed, should exonerate appellant from liability.  It appears  however that days after said affidavit was made Lontok subscribed to another  affidavit wherein he  described in  detail  the joint participation of the three accused in the liquidation of the victim.  This is an indication that the first affidavit was given by Lontok while he was still under the influence of his former employer, the appellant.</p>
<p>Premises considered, we find that  the guilt of appellant has been established by sufficient evidence which leaves no doubt as to his guilt.  And finding no error in the decision appealed  from, we hereby  affirm the same,  with costs against appellant.</p>
