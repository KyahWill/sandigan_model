				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Camarines&nbsp; Sur&nbsp; (Civil Case No.&nbsp; 1836), duly affirmed by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals (CA-G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; 10026-R), herein appellant Ponciana de la Cruz&nbsp; was&nbsp; sentenced to pay&nbsp; appellee Maxima Felipe "P50&nbsp; as damages for the year 1951, and to deliver&nbsp; to her&nbsp; thereafter five&nbsp; cavanes&nbsp; of&nbsp; palay every year,&nbsp; until&nbsp; the land&nbsp; is fully&nbsp; restored."&nbsp; To satisfy the&nbsp; judgment, the Sheriff&nbsp; levied upon appellant's&nbsp; four parcels of&nbsp; rice&nbsp; land and advertised&nbsp; the same&nbsp; for&nbsp; sale. Appellant petitioned&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare&nbsp;&nbsp; three of&nbsp; the parcels, covered by Tax Declarations No.&nbsp; 1836,&nbsp; 1226, and 2233, with a&nbsp; total assessed value of P290, to be exempt from execution as&nbsp; debtor's homestead,&nbsp; under&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 39, section&nbsp; 12, paragraph (<em>a</em>).&nbsp; The Court below denied&nbsp; the exemption, the parcels were sold, and Ponciana de la Cruz appealed to this Court.<p>In her&nbsp; brief&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 5-6),&nbsp; appellant admits that she has no homestead or residence in&nbsp; the controverted land; but avers that as&nbsp; her house was in the very land that, under the judgement, she must&nbsp; deliver to appellee herein; she is entitled to substitute the three parcels above mentioned Hin lieu of her homestead."&nbsp; Appellee avers, on the other hand, that as appellant does not actually occupy any of the parcels claimed, they do not become exempt from execution.</p><p>In our opinion, this theory of&nbsp; substitution cannot be maintained.&nbsp; It is to be observed that the rules on execution do in fact contemplate the&nbsp; possibility that property, otherwise exempt&nbsp; (like a&nbsp; homestead),&nbsp; may nevertheless be&nbsp; subject to&nbsp; execution&nbsp; under specified circumstances and&nbsp; yet&nbsp; no substitution&nbsp; provided for.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the last paragraph of&nbsp; section 12 of Rule 39, is to the effect that—&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"But no&nbsp; article or species of property mentioned shall be exempt from execution issued upon a judgment recovered for the price or upon a judgment of foreclosure of a mortgage thereon."</p></blockquote><p>The right to exemption from execution&nbsp; is purely statutory and&nbsp; as a matter of fact, Rule 39,&nbsp; section 12, ia but a reproduction of section 445&nbsp; of Act 190, as amended by Act&nbsp; No. 3862.&nbsp; Wherefore, the Courts have no power to extend, modify or&nbsp; restrict the exemption fixed by&nbsp; the Legislature, since such exemption is substantive and not procedural in character.&nbsp; The Legislature not having 'provided for a substitute homestead in case the home of the debtor is levied upon, courts are&nbsp; powerless&nbsp; to institute the replacement of such homestead&nbsp; with another property of the debtor.</p><p>Another argument&nbsp; against the&nbsp; stand of appellant&nbsp; is that by "debtor's homestead" the law means nothing else than the&nbsp; house in which the debtor resides.&nbsp; Interpreting the original provision of section 445 of Act 190 (the old Code of Civil Procedure), this Court has ruled in Young <em>vs.</em> Olivares,&nbsp; 41 Phil., 391, to that effect.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word 'homestead,' as used in English, usually imports not only the residential&nbsp; house occupied&nbsp; as a&nbsp; home but also the adjacent land necessarily used in connection&nbsp; therewith; and yet the word is sometimes used for&nbsp; either&nbsp; house&nbsp; or land separately. (See New&nbsp; Standard Dictionary, s. v. <span style="font-style: italic;">homestead</span>.)&nbsp; Now, in drafting the provision under consideration, the authors of the Code of Civil Procedure, out of abundant precaution&nbsp; and in order&nbsp; to&nbsp; avoid a narrow, interpretation of the word 'homestead,' added the expression and land&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; used&nbsp; in connection therewith.'&nbsp; By giving independent expression to this element in the&nbsp; signification of the word, the&nbsp; codifiers thereby narrowed the necessary import.of the word 'homestead with the result that, as it stands here, it means nothing more than house"(Cas. Cit. pp. 393-394).</p></blockquote><p>Since&nbsp; it is not contended that&nbsp; three&nbsp; lots&nbsp; involved in the appeal contain any house, the "homestead" exemption can not apply to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the debtor may&nbsp; now have the intention of transferring her dwelling to one of said lots, mere intent can not support the claim for exemption. The rule&nbsp; is&nbsp; well&nbsp; established&nbsp; that, unless&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; expressly provided, actual occupancy&nbsp; is necessary to acquire a homestead&nbsp; exemption (40 C.J.S., 458;&nbsp; Klots <em>vs.</em> Rhodes 240 Mo. 449, 144&nbsp; SW 791), and the homestead character can&nbsp; not be impressed upon&nbsp; the property only after its levy and&nbsp; seizure&nbsp; (Ann. Cas.&nbsp; 1913B,&nbsp; 1147-1151).&nbsp;&nbsp; This rule is recognized in&nbsp; the words&nbsp; of our&nbsp; law, declaring as exempt only—&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The debtor's homestead,&nbsp; in which he resides, and land necessarily used in connection therewith." </p></blockquote><p>If not&nbsp; as homestead, may&nbsp; the lots in&nbsp; question be held exempt from execution as&nbsp; 'land necessarily used in connection therewith"?&nbsp; The construction adopted&nbsp; in&nbsp; Young&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Olivares, supra, strongly indicates that^ since the term&nbsp; "homestead" is limited to the house, "and necessarily used in connection" with it must refer to the land upon which the&nbsp; house stands, and&nbsp; the adjacent lot needed&nbsp; for&nbsp; its dependencies&nbsp; (gardens, orchards, garages driveways, etc.) (29 C.J.&nbsp; 830; 40 C.J.S. 503). It does not&nbsp; seem&nbsp; cogent that&nbsp; "land necessarily&nbsp; used"&nbsp; should be&nbsp; made&nbsp; to apply to any land&nbsp; devoted to&nbsp; produce food for the support of the&nbsp; debtor, considering that&nbsp; the law&nbsp; already&nbsp; exempts, by&nbsp; express provisions, his means of livelihood,&nbsp; such as the tools&nbsp; and implements&nbsp; required for the debtor's trade and employment,&nbsp; his&nbsp; work&nbsp; animals, clothing and household utensils, besides&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">provisions </span>for him and his family "<em>sufficient for three&nbsp; months</em>"&nbsp; only&nbsp; and&nbsp; not&nbsp; indefinitely (Act 190; Rule 39, section 12).&nbsp; Were the "land necessarily&nbsp; used in connection therewith" intended to&nbsp; designate&nbsp; land required for the support of&nbsp; the&nbsp; debtor,&nbsp; as appellant&nbsp; contends, surely the law would have mentioned it either jointly with,&nbsp; or as an alternative to, the&nbsp; exemption of his means of earning a living (instruments, tools, etc.), but not in connection with his homestead.</p><p>But granting that "land necessarily used in connection" with the debtor's homestead includes the&nbsp; non-adjacent land upon which the&nbsp; debtors&nbsp; food is grown, there is on record no evidence that the lots&nbsp; here involved were devoted ty such purpose&nbsp; before the levy was made; and the&nbsp; burden of proof lay upon&nbsp; the appellant as claimant of the&nbsp; exemption to show such use (Agatep <em>vs.</em> Taguinod, 36 Phil. 435). And considering the finding of the Court below, that appellant owned nine (9) parcels of land in all (R. A. p. 10), we&nbsp; find no reason to consider that&nbsp; the appealed order, denying the&nbsp; exemption&nbsp; of the three&nbsp; lots here involved, constituted reversible&nbsp; error.</p><p>The order appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; Without costs.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia, </em>and <em>Felix, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
