				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant, Philippine Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. appeals from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, ordering the latter to pay to the&nbsp; plaintiff the sum of seventy-six thousand eight hundred thirty-two pesos and fifty-five&nbsp; centavos (P76,832.55)&nbsp; as&nbsp; of November 18,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; which includes the sum of P8,392.48&nbsp; representing the&nbsp; 17%&nbsp; excise tax. The defendant&nbsp; is also ordered to pay daily interest of P6.76 from and after November&nbsp; 18, 1955 until&nbsp; the full amount is paid.&nbsp; With costs against the defendant."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Case No. 19677)<br></blockquote>The appeal was originally interposed to the Court&nbsp; of Appeals;&nbsp; but&nbsp; in view of the amount involved in the case, which is more than P50,000, the same was elevated to this Court.<br><br>The records show that the&nbsp; Union Garment Co.,&nbsp; Inc., represented by its President, Celso Icasiano, imported for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (hereinafter referred to as the AFP)&nbsp; textile&nbsp; goods to be&nbsp; manufactured into soldiers' uniforms.&nbsp; The importation was made under&nbsp; an irrevocable letter of credit opened in favor of the importer by the appellee Philippine National Bank for the total sum of&nbsp; $147,000,&nbsp; U. S.&nbsp; currency.&nbsp;&nbsp; The drafts&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; by this letter of&nbsp; credit were&nbsp; required, under the terms&nbsp; of the instrument, to be drawn and presented&nbsp; not later than the&nbsp; 31st&nbsp; of&nbsp; December 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; letter of&nbsp; credit was negotiated on November 21, 1950, and four "sight" drafts were drawn against it by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Wingsan Textile Co., Ltd. for&nbsp; the&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; of&nbsp; $31,500,&nbsp; $24,500,&nbsp;&nbsp; $31,000&nbsp; and $60,000&nbsp; covering&nbsp; the aggregate sum&nbsp; of $147,000 which drafts were later&nbsp; accepted by the AFP.&nbsp; Upon the execution of a 90-day&nbsp; Trust Receipt Agreement, subject to a joint and several guaranty&nbsp; of the importer and defendant-appellant Philippine Surety &amp;&nbsp; Insurance Co.,&nbsp; Inc. to the extent of P73,400,&nbsp; the imported items&nbsp; were&nbsp; released&nbsp; to the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines).<br><br>On March&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1951, the appellee&nbsp; sent&nbsp; to the AFP a statement of account for&nbsp; P301,638.50&nbsp; covering&nbsp; the four drafts,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on August 22, 1951, the&nbsp; AFP sent to the appellee a check, Treasury Warrant No. V-421774, in the amount&nbsp; of P301,638.&nbsp; While&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment was awaited by the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; Republic Act No. 601 imposing a 17%&nbsp; special excise tax on foreign exchanges was approved and took effect&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1951.&nbsp; The bank,&nbsp; maintaining that no sale of foreign exchange was deemed to have been consummated until payment is received by&nbsp; it&nbsp; from the AFP, made&nbsp; adjustments&nbsp; with additional interest and&nbsp; bank charges occasioned&nbsp; by the imposition of the&nbsp; new tax, and&nbsp; applied the payment represented by the said Treasury Warrant to&nbsp; only three&nbsp; drafts&nbsp; covering the amounts&nbsp; of $31,500, $31,000 and&nbsp; $60,000 leaving&nbsp; a balance of P557.68 which was&nbsp; credited to the remaining account of $24,500 (fourth bank draft).&nbsp; A demand was accordingly made, but was refused by the defendant.<br><br>The whole issue in the case, and in this appeal, ultimately centers on whether or not the&nbsp; 17 per&nbsp; cent&nbsp; special excise tax could properly be imposed upon the drafts&nbsp; in question, admittedly&nbsp; executed&nbsp; and&nbsp; accepted before the effectivity of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 601&nbsp; as later amended&nbsp; (see Rep. Act Nos.&nbsp; 814, 871, 1175&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1375).<br><blockquote>"SEC. 1. Except as herein&nbsp; otherwise provided,&nbsp; there&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be assessed, collected and paid a special excise tax of seventeen per centum&nbsp; (17%)&nbsp; on the value in Philippine peso of foreign exchange sold and/or authorized&nbsp; to be&nbsp; sold&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank of the Philippines or&nbsp; any&nbsp; of its agents during&nbsp; the&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; two years counted from&nbsp; the date of the approval of this Act."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rep.&nbsp; Act 601).<br></blockquote>This question is not new and has been squarely resolved in&nbsp; the recent case of Belman&nbsp; Compania&nbsp; Incorporada <i>vs.</i> Central Bank of the Philippines, 104 Phil., 877, wherein this Court in holding that they could not&nbsp; be so subjected, said:<br><blockquote>"An irrevocable letter&nbsp; of credit granted by a bank, which authorizes a creditor in a foreign&nbsp; country to draw&nbsp; upon a&nbsp; debtor of another and to negotiate the draft through the agent or correspondent bank or any bank in the country of the creditor is&nbsp; a consummated contract, when the agent or correspondent bank or any bank in the country of the creditor pays or delivers to the&nbsp; latter the amount in foreign&nbsp; currency,&nbsp; as authorized by the&nbsp; bank in the country of the debtor in compliance with the letter of credit granted by it.&nbsp; It is the date of the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; in foreign currency to&nbsp; the creditor in his country by the agent or correspondent bank of the bank in the country of the debtor that turns from executory to executed or consummated contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the date of payment&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; debtor to&nbsp; the bank&nbsp; in his&nbsp; country of&nbsp; the amount of foreign exchange sold that makes the&nbsp; contract executed or consummated, because the bank&nbsp; may&nbsp; grant the debtor extension of time&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; such debt. The contention of the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; that as there was a&nbsp; meeting&nbsp; of the minds&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; contracting parties as to price&nbsp; and object of the contract upon the approval&nbsp; or&nbsp; grant of an application for&nbsp; a&nbsp; letter of credit for&nbsp; an amount&nbsp; payable in foreign currency,&nbsp; the contract was a valid and executed contract in the&nbsp; sense that one party&nbsp; who has&nbsp; performed his part&nbsp; may compel the&nbsp; other to perform his.&nbsp; Still&nbsp; until payment be made in foreign currency of&nbsp; the amount applied for in&nbsp; the letter&nbsp; of&nbsp; credit and&nbsp; approved and granted by the bank, the&nbsp; same is not an executed or consummated&nbsp; contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; The payment of the amount in foreign currency to the creditor by the bank or its agent or corespondent is necessary to consummate the contract.&nbsp; Hence, the date of such payment or delivery of&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; in foreign&nbsp; currency to the creditor&nbsp; determines&nbsp; whether such&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; foreign currency is subject to&nbsp; the&nbsp; tax&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Government of the&nbsp; country where such letter of credit&nbsp; was granted.<br><br>It appearing&nbsp; that the draft authorized&nbsp; by the letter of&nbsp; credit applied for&nbsp; by the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; and&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the appellant must be drawn and presented or&nbsp; negotiated in San Francisco, California, U.&nbsp; S. A.,&nbsp; not later than&nbsp; 19 October&nbsp; 1950 (Exhibit H), it may be presumed that the payment of $4,300 in favor of Getz&nbsp; Bros., Inc.&nbsp; in San Francisco,&nbsp; California,&nbsp; U. S. A.,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; account of the&nbsp; appellee was paid by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Crocker&nbsp; First&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; as agent&nbsp; or correspondent of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine National&nbsp; Bank, on&nbsp; or before&nbsp; 19&nbsp;&nbsp; October&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such being&nbsp; the case, the&nbsp; excise&nbsp; tax at the&nbsp; rate of&nbsp; 17&nbsp; per cent on the amount&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; paid by&nbsp; the appellant in Philippine currency for the foreign exchange sold is not&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; such tax because Republic Act No.&nbsp; 601&nbsp; imposing such&nbsp; tax&nbsp; took effect only on 28 March 1951."&nbsp;&nbsp; (See also Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Zulueta, 101&nbsp; Phil., 1071;&nbsp; and Philippine National Bank, et al., <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Union&nbsp; Books, Incorporated,&nbsp; 101&nbsp; Phil., 1084).<br></blockquote>It will be noted in the&nbsp; instant&nbsp; case that the letter&nbsp; of credit&nbsp; specifies that drafts&nbsp; must be drawn and presented or negotiated&nbsp; before December&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1950, and that&nbsp; the statement of account was sent on&nbsp; March 12,&nbsp; 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows&nbsp; that the&nbsp; drafts&nbsp; were executed,&nbsp; presented&nbsp; and became&nbsp; payable before the&nbsp; effectivity&nbsp; of Rep.&nbsp; Act 601 (see&nbsp; PNB <i>vs.</i> Arrozal, 103 Phil.,&nbsp; 213;&nbsp; 54 Off. Gaz., [2] 5698).<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the judgment appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; reversed and complaint ordered dismissed,&nbsp; without&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
