				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In&nbsp; an&nbsp; information dated&nbsp; October 1, 1954&nbsp; Benjamin Gomez&nbsp; y Sanga,&nbsp; Alejandro Ramos&nbsp; y Cailao,&nbsp; Komualdo Lobrio y Miranda, Ricardo de Jesus y Gatos <i>alias</i> Carding Aguila, and Dominador Senio y Gaviola were charged with the crime of&nbsp; robbery with homicide committed at No.&nbsp; 1198 La Torre St.,&nbsp; Manila, on&nbsp; September 29, 1954,&nbsp; on which occasion the&nbsp; owner of the&nbsp; house, Pablo Lim, was stabbed with a kitchen knife and killed.&nbsp; The first&nbsp; four were all arrested and&nbsp; when the information was read to them,&nbsp; they all pleaded not guilty.&nbsp; Before the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; Komualdo&nbsp; Lobrio y&nbsp; Miranda withdrew his plea and entered a&nbsp; plea of&nbsp; guilty, so the case continued as to the other three&nbsp; accused.&nbsp; But after two of the most important witnesses for the prosecution had testified, Benjamin Gomez y Sanga&nbsp; and Alejandro Ramos y&nbsp; Cailao also withdrew&nbsp; their former plea&nbsp; of not guilty and substituted it with&nbsp; that of guilty.&nbsp; So the&nbsp; case continued with respect to the last two of the accused, namely Ricardo de Jesus y Gatos alias Carding Aguila and Dominador Senio&nbsp; alias Adol.&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; conclusion of&nbsp; the trial the court acquitted Dominador Senio&nbsp; alias&nbsp; Adol but&nbsp; found Ricardo&nbsp; de Jesus&nbsp; guilty and&nbsp; sentenced&nbsp; him accordingly. All the three accused&nbsp; who&nbsp; had&nbsp; pleaded&nbsp; guilty were&nbsp; also sentenced.<br><br>Ricardo de Jesus y Gatos appealed from the judgment to the Court of Appeals, which&nbsp; certified the case to US on the ground that the&nbsp; judgment appealed from imposes the penalty of <i>reclusion&nbsp; perpetua</i> upon four of the accused.<br><br>It is not disputed, and the evidence for the prosecution satisfactorily shows, that after midnight (about 1 o'clock) of September 23,&nbsp; 1954, while the spouses Pablo Lim and Virginia Flores and their children were&nbsp; sleeping soundly in their house at 1198 La Torre street, Tondo, Manila, the wife was suddenly awakened as she noticed someone walking above&nbsp; the head of her husband.&nbsp; She immediately shouted to her husband, 'Tabling, Pabling, <i>mayroon magnanakaw."</i> Thereupon, she went to the kitchen to inform her mother- in-law of the presence of a thief in&nbsp; the house.&nbsp; Her son Donilo Lim, 9 years old,&nbsp; was also awakened by the noise of a person&nbsp; walking in the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw this&nbsp; person taking a radio, some clothes and&nbsp; a clock, which he carried to a window and which he handed to another at that place. Both the mother and Danilo&nbsp; Lim testified that the person who was inside the room was the accused Alejandro Ramos. But the boy&nbsp; also&nbsp; declared that he&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; the person who stabbed&nbsp; his father near the window and that it was Romualdo Lobrio.<br><br>The evidence submitted by the prosecution&nbsp; to connect the appellant Ricardo&nbsp; de&nbsp; Jesus y Gatos with the crime is his confession, Exhibit "A"&nbsp; which he&nbsp; signed&nbsp; before the police on September 80, 1954. According to the detectives who testified for the prosecution the appellant signed this freely&nbsp; and voluntarily.&nbsp; But the appellant&nbsp; claims that it was not made voluntarily, alleging&nbsp; that he was forced&nbsp; to sign it because he had been&nbsp; manhandled&nbsp; and was&nbsp; beaten badly by the police, and that he had to sign it because&nbsp; of the beating that&nbsp; he received&nbsp; and&nbsp; the pains he&nbsp; felt by reason of the beating.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellant sought&nbsp; to corroborate his claim, that the confession was obtained by him through force and&nbsp; violence, by the testimonies of the other accused, namely, Alejandro Ramos, Benjamin Gomez and Romualdo Lobrio.&nbsp; The appellant also submitted evidence to the&nbsp; effect that&nbsp; in the evening' of&nbsp; September 29, he was in a party in which&nbsp; drinking was indulged in;&nbsp; that&nbsp; at about 10 o'clock that night he was brought to&nbsp; his house drunk; that he went to sleep immediately and was in bed until&nbsp; about 4 o'clock the next morning.&nbsp; This testimony of his was corroborated by that of his father and Francisco del Mundo&nbsp; and Delfin Reyes.&nbsp; In spite of this&nbsp; formidable array of&nbsp; witnesses declaring1 in favor of the appellant, the trial court refused to&nbsp; believe the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of the appellant.<br><br>We have taken pains to scrutinize with care the confession signed by&nbsp; the appellant and&nbsp; we find that&nbsp; it&nbsp; could not have been the voluntary confession of the appellant,&nbsp; as the prosecution&nbsp; claims and as the court <i>a quo</i> found&nbsp; it, but that&nbsp; it&nbsp; must have been&nbsp; prepared under the direction&nbsp; of the accused Romualdo Lobrio and put to writing under the latter's&nbsp; direction, and that the appellant was compelled to sign it&nbsp; later as his own confession.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus Alejandro Ramos testified that the&nbsp; statements! were given to the detectives&nbsp; by Lobrio and Gomez, and&nbsp; not by Ricardo&nbsp; de Jesus (t.s.n.,&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 41-42,&nbsp; hearing on&nbsp; January 4, 1955). Benjamin Gomez declared that the&nbsp; appellant did not want to give a statement but that Alejandro Samoa&nbsp; maltreated him as&nbsp; also did the detectives&nbsp; (t.s.n., pp. 35-36, <i>idem.</i>) Romualdo Lobrio declared that appellant was forced to sign the confession1 and that he, Lobrio, was&nbsp; one of those who gave&nbsp; him fist blows to compel him to sign the statement (t.s.n., p. 8, hearing on January 11, 1955).<br><br>The confession contains&nbsp; the statement that&nbsp; the person who was inside the house and who stabbed Pablo Lim was Adol&nbsp; (Bominador Senio y Gaviola), and that Adol took the stolen things&nbsp; inside the&nbsp; room of the house and delivered them to Ricardo de Jesus,&nbsp; who in turn handed the things stolen to Romualdo Lobrio, who was downstairs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; statements conflict with the evidence submitted by the prosecution, according to which it was Alejandro Ramos who was inside the&nbsp; room; that&nbsp; Alejandro Ramos&nbsp; delivered the articles stolen to&nbsp; Romualdo&nbsp; Lobrio near the window, and that it was Romualdo Lobrio who stabbed the owner&nbsp; of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same&nbsp; statements are contained in the affidavit of Benjamin Gomez&nbsp; and Romualdo Lobrio (Exhibits "1", "i"&nbsp; and "j"),&nbsp; namely, that it was Dominador Senio and Ricardo de Jesus who were inside the house and&nbsp; that Alejandro Ramos and Romualdo Lobrio and&nbsp; Gomez&nbsp; who were&nbsp; down below. The parallelism between the three affidavits or confessions signed&nbsp; by Alejandro Ramos,&nbsp; Romualdo Lobrio and&nbsp; Ricardo de Jesus to the effect that the appellant and Dominador Senio were inside the house while the other three&nbsp; accused, Lobrio, Gomez and Ramos were down below, leads&nbsp; to the conclusion&nbsp; that the confessions were&nbsp; actually the&nbsp; statements&nbsp; given for the&nbsp; appellant by the three accused&nbsp; who&nbsp; pleaded guilty,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; Lobrio, Ramos and Gomez.&nbsp;&nbsp; These confessions were made&nbsp; on&nbsp; September 30,&nbsp; before&nbsp; trial&nbsp; and before&nbsp; they pleaded&nbsp; guilty. Evidently, at that time, they wanted to shift the blame to De Jesus, the appellant, and to Senio. But when the&nbsp; trial started and&nbsp; proceeded, and the witnesses&nbsp; for the prosecution testified and&nbsp; pointed&nbsp; out&nbsp; Lobrio and Ramos&nbsp; as the ones who were inside the house and stabbed the deceased owner, they had no other recourse but to&nbsp; admit their guilt, and impelled&nbsp; by their conscience they later admitted that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was they&nbsp; who&nbsp; had committed the offense,&nbsp;&nbsp; and they&nbsp; also testified&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the appellant Ricardo de Jesus.<br><br>We are fully satisfied&nbsp; after&nbsp; a consideration of the facts and circumstances,&nbsp; especially&nbsp; above set&nbsp; forth, that the confession Exhibit "H",&nbsp; although signed&nbsp; by&nbsp; appellant Ricardo&nbsp; de Jesus, does not represent a voluntary acknowledgment by him of his&nbsp; participation&nbsp; in the crime, but a statement of his co-accused imputing to&nbsp; him the&nbsp; offense and&nbsp; relieving&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; (the accused)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; responsibility for the act which they themselves had committed. Under these circumstances we must declare that the charge against&nbsp; the appellant has not been proved beyond reasonable&nbsp; doubt as the law requires, and we must declare him innocent of the charge&nbsp; and absolve&nbsp; him therefrom.<br><br>The judgment appealed from, declaring appellant guilty, is hereby reversed&nbsp; and the appellant acquitted, with&nbsp; costs <i>de oficio</i> in both instances.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J. B.&nbsp; L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
