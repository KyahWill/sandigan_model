				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff Pedro O. Casimiro is appealing from the&nbsp; decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal dated January 22, 1954, dismissing his petition&nbsp; and ordering him to pay to defendant Leon Eoque the suras of P500 as damages and , P1.500&nbsp; as&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees.&nbsp; Involving&nbsp; only&nbsp; questions&nbsp; of law, the appeal was taken directly to us.&nbsp; The facts in the case are the following.<br><br>Since November, 1953, defendant Rogue had been operating a&nbsp; cockpit known as the grace&nbsp; park&nbsp; cockpit on 3rd Avenue,&nbsp; Grace Park, Caloocan, Rizal under the authority of Ordinance No. 6, series of&nbsp; 1953, of the Municipality of Caloocan, which&nbsp; authorizes among&nbsp; others the&nbsp; operation of cockpits&nbsp; within said municipality beyond a distance of 250 lineal meters from any city, municipal or provincial building, public plazas, schools, churches, etc.&nbsp; Claiming that Ordinance No, 6 was illegal and void for being in conflict with the&nbsp; provisions of Presidential&nbsp; Executive Order No. 318, series of 1941 which prohibits the operation of cockpits within a radius of 1,00.0 lineal meters from any of the public places and buildings&nbsp; above-mentioned; that as a&nbsp; matter of fact the Office of the President of the Philippines had ordered the Provincial Treasurer&nbsp; of Rizal&nbsp; to&nbsp; stop&nbsp; the operation&nbsp; of the Grace Park. Cockpit; and that although defendant Rogue had received&nbsp; the corresponding notification from the Provincial Treasurer, nevertheless, he continued operating his&nbsp; cockpit, plaintiff, Casimiro filed the petition which initiated the present proceedings to&nbsp; have the court declare Ordinance No. 6, series&nbsp; of 1953 null and void, and that&nbsp; Rogue&nbsp; be&nbsp; perpetually enjoined from operating his&nbsp; cockpit.<br><br>Acting upon the prayer in the petition for, the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, the trial court issued an order to defendant Roque and the municipal authorities concerned to stop&nbsp; the operation of the cockpit in question upon&nbsp; the filing of-a-fe»fi4-in the amount of P2,000.&nbsp; Subsequently, this writ of preliminary injunction was dissolved upon&nbsp; the filing of a&nbsp; counterbond of f2,000 by the defendant.<br><br>In his amended&nbsp; answer defendant claimed that.the cockpit was being operated lawfully and in compliance with the requirements of municipal ordinance No, 6; that the said ordinance is&nbsp; legal and&nbsp; valid; that Presidential Executive Order No. 318&nbsp; on the other hand, is&nbsp; null and void and Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 601 approved&nbsp; on August 19, 1940, under whose&nbsp; authority&nbsp; the&nbsp; Presidential Executive Order No. 318 was issued,&nbsp; is unconstitutional; and that plaintiff has no personality to&nbsp; institute the present action, he, not being a party in interest.<br><br>The petition was originally brought against Leon Roque as alleged concessionaire of&nbsp; the cockpit and Ernesto Gonzales&nbsp; as alleged owner&nbsp; of the&nbsp; location of said cockpit. However, by agreement&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parties, Ernesto Gonzales was eliminated as party-defendant.&nbsp; After agreeing to certain facts of minor importance&nbsp; counsels for both parties expressed their&nbsp; willingness to&nbsp; submit&nbsp; the&nbsp; case for final, decision&nbsp; by the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court on&nbsp; the pleadings under such agreement after&nbsp; filing their respective memoranda.&nbsp; Judge Bienvenido A. Tan, presiding over the. trial court, deciding the case&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp; the cockpit in question was&nbsp; being operated legally&nbsp; and in accordance with' the requirements of Ordinance No. 6,; that defendant Roque was&nbsp; expressly authorized by municipal resolution to&nbsp; operate the&nbsp; said cockpit under the said Ordinance until the latter is duly disapproved by&nbsp; the Provincial Board,&nbsp; by the court&nbsp; or by order of competent authorities, and that the corresponding permit&nbsp; for the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the cockpit&nbsp; had&nbsp; been duly issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court also held that Municipal Ordinance, No. 6 prescribing an area of 250 lineal meters was legal and valid because it was enacted by the Municipal Council by&nbsp; virtue of its delegated powers conferred upon&nbsp; it by section&nbsp; 2243- (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Revised Administrative Code authorizing municipal councils "to regulate' cockpits, cock- fighting; and the 'keeping or training of fighting&nbsp; cocks Or prohibit either." <br><br>From the record we gather that the municipal ordinance in question,was&nbsp; subsequently disapproved by the Provincial Board of Rizal. The trial court,. however,&nbsp; held,&nbsp; citing judicial&nbsp; authorities,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Board has&nbsp; no' authority to&nbsp; disapprove&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; ordinances&nbsp; enacted by municipal&nbsp; councils in&nbsp; the exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; delegated powers merely on grounds of unreasonableness or unconstitutionality or&nbsp; against, public policy,&nbsp; and that provincial boards may disapprove a municipal ordinance only on one ground,&nbsp; namely, when&nbsp; it&nbsp; is enacted beyond the powers granted upon it by its&nbsp; charter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court equally held that Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No- 601 on the strength of&nbsp; which Presidential Executive Order No. 318&nbsp; was issued,'conferring as it does "upon the President complete, absolute and unlimited power to promulgate regulations governing the establishment and&nbsp; operation.of places of amusements, including cockpits"&nbsp; "makes&nbsp; an&nbsp; unconditional surrender&nbsp; of legislative powers&nbsp; unto&nbsp; the Executive without any&nbsp; limitation whatsoever"&nbsp; and&nbsp; so is unconstitutional&nbsp; and,&nbsp; consequently, Presidential Executive Order No.&nbsp; 318&nbsp; must&nbsp; be held to be inoperative for the reason that&nbsp; the power&nbsp; or authority from which&nbsp; it&nbsp; emanates&nbsp; is 'invalid.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial court added&nbsp; that assuming that Commonwealth Act No. €01 is not unconstitutional, nevertheless, Presidential&nbsp; Executive Order No.&nbsp; 318&nbsp; is&nbsp; invalid for&nbsp; being unreasonable, oppressive and prohibitive for the reason that if the restriction of 1,000&nbsp; lineal meters prescribed in&nbsp; it&nbsp; were to&nbsp; be enforced, it would&nbsp; be tantamount to prohibiting the establishment&nbsp; of&nbsp; cockpits&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; many municipalities&nbsp; and&nbsp; will, operate to remove from municipal councils&nbsp; the power to' regulate amusement places and deprive&nbsp; them of a&nbsp; good source of income. <br><br>Lastly, the&nbsp; trial court held&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff, has&nbsp; no personality to sue in this case, because there is no showing that the result of&nbsp; this&nbsp; action will affect said plaintiff one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp; It said:<br><blockquote>"There is no showing upon the complaint that the plaintiff is a cockpit operator anywhere&nbsp; in the Municipality of Caloocan&nbsp; which might be affected&nbsp; by the&nbsp; operation of&nbsp; the cockpit' in question; there is no showing&nbsp; that the result of this action will affect him personally&nbsp; or his interest;&nbsp; there is no showing that the result of this action will affect him one way or another.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, plaintiff is not even a resident of the Municipality of Caloocan."<br></blockquote>For the reasons and findings above&nbsp; mentioned, as already stated,&nbsp; the trial court dismissed the petition and ordered plaintiff to pay to&nbsp; defendant P500 as damages and P1,500 as attorney's fees. <br><br>Inasmuch&nbsp; as we find&nbsp; the question of the personality of plaintiff squarely raised in the appeal to be decisive,' we propose to limit our discussion and consideration&nbsp; of the appeal to this issue, deeming it unnecessary to pass&nbsp; upon the other legal points raised in the assignment of errors. As correctly held by the trial court, the petition of the plaintiff&nbsp; does not show that he is an operator of a cockpit in the Municipality of Caloocan, which might be affected by the continued operation&nbsp; of the cockpit of defendant Rogue. It is true that in his petition, plaintiff in paragraph 10 alleges that he applied for a similar permit to&nbsp; operate a cockpit under said Ordinance No. 6 but was denied the same on&nbsp; the ground that said Ordinance was illegal and void and the place where plaintiff&nbsp; planned to operate&nbsp; it was within the distance prohibited by Executive Order No. 318.&nbsp; The petition did&nbsp; not specify before what office or entity he made&nbsp; his application for&nbsp; a permit to operate a cockpit.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in his motion for reconsideration of the decision,&nbsp; he explained that he made such application with the office of the President of the Philippines,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; it was denied because it violated the provisions of Presidential Executive Order No. 318, particularly the portion&nbsp; thereof regarding the restrictive&nbsp; area&nbsp; or distance&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1,000 lineal meters, and that in connection with said&nbsp; denial, when the Office of&nbsp; the president was informed of the promulgation of Ordinance No. 6 of Caloocan, and the operation of the Grace Park Cockpit by defendant Roque, the Executive Secretary directed&nbsp; the closure of said cockpit, at, the same time expressing&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; that Ordinance No. 6 was void as violating the provisions of Presidential&nbsp; Executive Order No.&nbsp; 318.<br><br>To show&nbsp; that he is a party&nbsp; in interest, plaintiff in his motion for new trial for the first time claimed that he&nbsp; is a&nbsp; partner of&nbsp; the partnership denominated "GUISON, CASIMIRO and JOSE" duly registered&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Securities&nbsp; and Exchange&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; on December 29, 1950; that the partnership maintains and operates a cockpit in the barrio of La Loma, Quezon City, "which, although not within the territorial limits of Caloocan,&nbsp; is in competition with and rival in&nbsp; business&nbsp; of the cockpit of the&nbsp; defendant."&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; correctly objected&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; motion for new trial in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; introduce this supposedly newly&nbsp; discovered evidence&nbsp; of partnership,&nbsp; and the trial court properly denied&nbsp; said motion&nbsp; because&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; had&nbsp; this&nbsp; evidence all along which he should have introduced during the regular hearing to establish his legal interest in the case.&nbsp; Furthermore, even considering this new evidence, and assuming for a moment&nbsp; that although&nbsp; the cockpit being operated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; partnership of which the plaintiff is a&nbsp; partner is outside the town of Caloocan where the Grace Park Cockpit was being operated by the defendant, nevertheless there would&nbsp; be competition&nbsp; which would&nbsp; affect&nbsp; the financial interests of the partnership, then it should be the partnership and riot&nbsp; plaintiff as&nbsp; a&nbsp; mere partner that was the real party in interest,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the petition in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case should have&nbsp; been filed&nbsp; in its name.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; if as claimed by plaintiff&nbsp; the&nbsp; Office&nbsp; of the&nbsp; President&nbsp; itself&nbsp; had&nbsp; directed the closure of the Grace Park Cockpit for&nbsp; operating against the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Presidential Executive Order No.&nbsp; 318, then&nbsp; the remedy&nbsp; now sought&nbsp; by plaintiff could well be obtained in the Executive Department instead of&nbsp; the courts.<br><br>For the information of the parties&nbsp; herein, particularly plaintiff-appellant,&nbsp; it may&nbsp; not be&nbsp; out of place to invite their attention to our decision in a similar case—Rodriguez and Rodriguez vs. Sotero&nbsp; Baluyot,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al. (97 Phil.,&nbsp; 420) promulgated&nbsp; August 11, 1955, particularly the following portion thereof:<br><blockquote>"Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 601 prohibited the&nbsp; licensing' of certain places of amusement&nbsp; except in accordance&nbsp; with rules? and regulations to be promulgated by the&nbsp; President of the Philippines. On tho authority of this Act,&nbsp; the President promulgated Executive Order No. 327, series of 1941, prohibiting the&nbsp; maintenance or operation of bowling alleys within a radius of 200&nbsp; lineal&nbsp; meters from certain public places, among;&nbsp; them, public parks and institutions of learning. But on May 21, 1954, Republic Act No. 979&nbsp; was approved, placing in the hands of municipal councils the power of regulating bowling alleys and billiard pools within their respective' territorial&nbsp; jurisdictions, but providing that they were not to be established&nbsp; within a radius of&nbsp; 50Q&nbsp; lineal&nbsp; meters 'from&nbsp; any public building,&nbsp; schools, hospitals and churches.'&nbsp; As the exercise of the regulatory power granted to the&nbsp; President by Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No-&nbsp; 601&nbsp; is inconsistent "with&nbsp; the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of that same&nbsp; power&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal councils as authorized by Republic Act No. 979,&nbsp; th? former enactment&nbsp; (along with the executive orders issued&nbsp; thereunder) must&nbsp; be deemed repealed by&nbsp; section 2 of the later Act, which&nbsp; provides that 'any law, executive order or&nbsp; parts thereof inconsistent&nbsp; with, the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed.' "<br></blockquote>And&nbsp; on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1955, Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1224&nbsp; was approved amending Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 979, section&nbsp; 1&nbsp; of which reads in part:<br><blockquote>"Section 1 The&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; 'or city&nbsp; hoard&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; council of&nbsp; each chartered city and the municipal&nbsp; council&nbsp; of each municipality and municipal district shall have the power to, regulate or prohibit&nbsp; by ordinance the establishment, maintenance and operation&nbsp; of night clubs,&nbsp; cabarets,&nbsp; dancing schools, pavilions,&nbsp; cockpits, bars, saloons, bowling alleys, billiard pools, and other similar&nbsp; places of amusement within its territorial jurisdiction:&nbsp; Provided, however, That no such places&nbsp; of amusement mentioned herein shall be established, maintained, and/or operated within&nbsp; a&nbsp; radius&nbsp; of two&nbsp; hundred lineal&nbsp; meters&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of night clubs, cabarets, pavilions, or&nbsp; other&nbsp; similar&nbsp; places, and fifty lineal&nbsp; meters in the case of dancing schools,&nbsp; bars, saloons, billiard pools, bowling alleys,&nbsp; or other similar places, except cockpits, , the distance of which shall be left to the discretion of the municipal or city board or council, from any public building, schools, hospitals and churches: " *,"&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied)<br></blockquote>The relevancy&nbsp; of or effect of&nbsp; the above quotations,&nbsp; if any,&nbsp; on the parties, the&nbsp; latter will&nbsp; decide for themselves.<br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing, we&nbsp; affirm the&nbsp; decision appealed from in so far as it&nbsp; dismisses the&nbsp; petition on the ground&nbsp; that plaintiff has no personality to sue, not being a real party in interest and in so far? as&nbsp; it orders&nbsp; plaintiff to&nbsp; pay to&nbsp; defendant P500&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; damages&nbsp; and&nbsp; P1.500&nbsp; as attorney's&nbsp; fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; With costs. <br><br><i>Paras, C.
