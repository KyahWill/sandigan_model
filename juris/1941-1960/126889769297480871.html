				G.R. No. L-3078, September 27, 1949</h4>
				<H3>JOSE P. BENGZON, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF IMMIGRATION, PETITIONER, VS. BUENAVENTURA OCAMPO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND MARIANO CHAN (ALIAS ONG LIAN CHO), AS AN INTERESTED PARTY, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The deportation of the respondent Mariano Chan <i>alias</i> Ong 
Lian Cho was, after the required investigation, ordered by the Bureau of 
Immigration for having maintained a house of prostitution. Pending the execution 
of the order of deportation, said respondent filed a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus with the Court of First Instance of Manila presided over by the 
other respondent Hon. Judge Ocampo; and during the pendency of the habeas corpus 
proceeding the respondent Judge Ocampo, upon motion of the other respondent 
above mentioned, ordered the provisional release of the latter under the 
condition that he should file a bond of P10,000 and report to the Bureau of 
Immigration on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday of every week.
<p align="justify">The question involved in the present case is whether or not the 
respondent Judge acted in excess of the court's jurisdiction in granting the 
petition of the respondent Mariano Chan for his temporary release on bail during 
the pendency of the habeas corpus proceeding instituted by him against the 
Commissioner of Immigration on the ground that the Bureau of Immigration has no 
power or jurisdiction to detain and order the deportation of the said 
respondent.</p>
<p align="justify">The only legal provision which has some bearing on the question 
is section 12, Rule 102, of the Rules of Court which provides the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<i>Hearing on return. Adjournments</i>.â€”When the writ is 
returned before one judge, at a time when the court is in session, he nay 
forthwith adjourn the case into the court, there to be heard and determined. The 
court or judge before whom the writ is returned or adjourned must immediately 
proceed to hear and examine the return, and such other matters as are properly 
submitted for consideration, unless for godd cause shown the hearing is 
adjourned, in which event the court or judge shall make such order for the 
safekeeping of the person imprisoned or restrained as the nature of the case 
requires. * * *".</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">According to the above quoted provisions the judge in a habeas 
corpus proceeding must immediately proceed to hear aid decide the case, unless 
for good cause shown the hearing is adjourned, in which event the court or judge 
shall make such order for the safekeeping of the person imprisoned or restrained 
as the nature of the case requires. It is obvious that the phrase "for the 
safekeeping of the person imprisoned or restrained" can not be construed to mean 
temporary release on bail, because a person arrested or detained can not be 
released on bail unless that right is granted expressly by law, as the right of 
defendants in criminal cases to be released on bail under certain condition, as 
well as the right of a person, whose release has been ordered by judgment in a 
habeas corpus proceeding to be temporarily released on bail if appeal is taken 
by the officer or person detaining, granted by section 20 of Rule 41, Rules of 
Court. On the contrary, the word "safekeeping" according to the dictionaries 
means "the act or state of keeping or being kept in safety." A person arrested 
is not safely kep$ if released on bail.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not necessary for us to determine, (<i>a</i>) whether the 
Commissioner of Immigration has authority to release an alien under bail or 
other conditions after the Board of Immigration has ordered his deportation as 
in the present case, although it seems that there is no provision of law 
expressly authorizing such release; and, (<i>b</i>) whether an alien under 
arrest in a deportation proceeding has the right to be released under reasonable 
bond or condition before the Bureau of Immigration has rendered its decision 
ordering his deportation, and therefore the courts of justice may, in a habeas 
corpus proceeding, grant his temporary release on bail if the Commissioner of 
Immigration refuses to grant or requires unreasonable bond or conditions for his 
release; because these are not now the questions submitted to us for 
decision.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, we hold that the respondent judge 
acted in excess of the jurisdiction of the court in releasing the defendant on 
bail during the pendency of the habeas corpus proceeding, and therefore the 
order complained of is set aside with costs against the respondent Mariano Chan. 
So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
