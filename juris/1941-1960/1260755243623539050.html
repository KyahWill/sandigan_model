				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 21, 1951, this Court&nbsp; rendered a decision in G. R. No. L-3846 ordering the Testate Estate of Margarita&nbsp; David to pay the claim&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Testate Estate&nbsp; of Crispulo Sideeo&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P17,010.43,&nbsp; with legal interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from March 11, 1945,&nbsp; until the same is&nbsp; fully paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; falicitate&nbsp; the payment of this&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; Pr,iscilla F.&nbsp; Sison,&nbsp; an. heiress&nbsp; of the estate, delivered to its administrator the amount&nbsp; of P12,128.44 to cover the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; her one half share in the&nbsp; Sideco claim.&nbsp; The other heiress, herein appellant Narcisa F.&nbsp; Teodoro, was unwilling to&nbsp; do the&nbsp; same, contending that the Estate&nbsp; has real properties which could be sold and&nbsp; with&nbsp; its proceeds pay the Sideeo claim hence, on&nbsp; January 23,&nbsp; 1952, the&nbsp; administrator filed a&nbsp; petition with the&nbsp; lower court to compel Narcisa&nbsp; F. Teodoro&nbsp; to deliver to him&nbsp; her share&nbsp; in the payment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; afore-mentioned Sideco claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this motion was&nbsp; pending hearing because of the opposition&nbsp; thereto filed by appellant, on&nbsp; March 5,&nbsp; 1952, the&nbsp; Co-Administratrix&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Estate of Crispulo&nbsp; Sideco filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila to secure an order directing&nbsp; the&nbsp; Administrator&nbsp; of the Testate&nbsp; Estate of Margarita David&nbsp; to , pay the aforementioned claim of&nbsp; P 17,010.43 plus the legal interest accrued thereon.&nbsp; Both the petition of the Administrator of&nbsp; the Testate&nbsp; Estate of&nbsp; Margarita&nbsp; fervid&nbsp; and that&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Administratrix of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sideco&nbsp; Testate Estate were heard&nbsp; and, on April 5, 1952, the lower court entered an order,&nbsp; the pertinent portion&nbsp; of which reads&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"With respect to the&nbsp; petition of&nbsp; the Administrator filed&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1S52,&nbsp; it appears&nbsp; that -in the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals&nbsp; in CA-G. B. No.&nbsp; 3921-R, promulgated on June SO, 1950, the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; P272.000&nbsp; was&nbsp; hold&nbsp; to be&nbsp; residuary&nbsp; cash&nbsp; within this&nbsp; testate proceeding and that 'the same was equally&nbsp; divided between the two heiresses herein, Narcisa de la Fuente and Priscilla de la Fuente.<br><br>"In the light of all the foregoing, this Court hereby directs&nbsp; the heiresses Narcisa de la&nbsp; Fuente&nbsp; and Priscilla&nbsp; de la Fuente&nbsp; to deposit with&nbsp; the Philippine National&nbsp; Bank, in&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Estate of Crispulo Sideco,&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of P17,010.43, with legal interest thereon&nbsp; at the rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; 6 per cent per annum from March 11,&nbsp; 1945 until&nbsp; fully paid,&nbsp; which&nbsp; amount&nbsp; and&nbsp; interest shall&nbsp; be paid by said heiresses, share and&nbsp; share alike, out of the&nbsp; residuary cash&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to this estate which has been&nbsp; equally&nbsp; divided between them, submitting proof of&nbsp; such deposit&nbsp; within&nbsp; ten&nbsp; (10) days from&nbsp; receipt of this order.<br><br>"No withdrawal shall be made from&nbsp; said deposit without previous judicial authority and the same&nbsp; shall be subject to the further orders in Special Proceeding No. E-121 of this&nbsp; Court."<br></blockquote>On&nbsp; May 22, 1952, heiress Narcisa&nbsp; F. de Teodoro filed a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration&nbsp; of the aforequoted&nbsp; order on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that (1)&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; against&nbsp; section&nbsp; 1&nbsp; of Rule&nbsp; 89, Rules of Court;&nbsp; (2) that thereunder&nbsp; the executor of the testate estate,&nbsp; and not&nbsp; the heiresses, should&nbsp; be ordered to pay the claim&nbsp; of Sideco&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that although the sum of P272,000 was held by the&nbsp; lower court and, on&nbsp; appeal, by the Court&nbsp; of Appeals to be residuary cash "within this estate, the&nbsp; same was divided and has been in the possession of the universal heiresses since 1941 and therefore, not&nbsp; liable&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay any claim against the&nbsp; estate so&nbsp; long as there are sufficient assets in the hands&nbsp; of the Judicial Administrator to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; them; and&nbsp; (4) that&nbsp; it would&nbsp; be more&nbsp; beneficial to the heiresses&nbsp; that the&nbsp; real properties in the hands of the Judicial Administrator&nbsp; be sold&nbsp; by him and&nbsp; out&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; proceeds the Sideco&nbsp; claim be paid, because such&nbsp; sale would hasten the&nbsp; early&nbsp; termination of these&nbsp; testate&nbsp;&nbsp; proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; this&nbsp; motion,&nbsp; on February 5, 1953, the lower court entered&nbsp; the&nbsp; following orders:<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; April 23, 1952, the&nbsp; heiresses Nareisa de&nbsp; la Fuente and Priscila de la Fuente were&nbsp; directed to deposit with the Philippine National Bank, in the name of the Estate of Crispulo Sideco,&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P17,010.43,&nbsp; with,&nbsp; interest&nbsp; thereon at&nbsp; the rate of 6 per cent per annum from&nbsp; March 11, 1945,&nbsp; until fully paid, representing&nbsp; the&nbsp; approved&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; said estate against this estate,&nbsp; which amount and interest shall he paid&nbsp; by said heiresses, share and share alike,&nbsp; out of the residuary cash belonging to this estate&nbsp; which has been&nbsp; equally divided between&nbsp; them.<br><br>"Complying with the&nbsp; said&nbsp; order,&nbsp; the&nbsp; heiress&nbsp; Priscilla de la fuente deposited&nbsp; with the Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank on May 8, 1952, the amount of P12.128.44 as her&nbsp; share in the payment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sideco&nbsp; claim in accordance with&nbsp; the said order of April 23, 1952. However, the heiress Narciaa de la Fuente filed&nbsp; a motion seeking the reconsideration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; order on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that the estate&nbsp; has sufficient real&nbsp; properties which could be sold to pay the Sideco&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; invoking the provisions of section 1 of Rule 89 of the&nbsp; Rules of&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; Said section 1 of Rule 89 reads follows:<br><br>'SECTION 1. <i>Debts paid in&nbsp; full if estate sufficient.â€”</i>If, after hearing all&nbsp; the money claims&nbsp; against&nbsp; the estate, and of ascertaining the amount, of such claims, it appears that there sufficient assets&nbsp; to pay the debts,&nbsp; the executor or administrator shall pay the same within the time limited:for the purpose.'<br><br>"As&nbsp; stated in&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; April 23, i952,&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of P272.000&nbsp; was held to be&nbsp; residuary cash,&nbsp; within the test proceeding in the decision of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G. No. 8921-R, promulgated on June 30,&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp; The said residuary cash, therefore, is an asset&nbsp; of&nbsp; this estate which should&nbsp; be&nbsp; applied&nbsp; to the payment of the,debts mentioned in section 1 of&nbsp; Rule 89.<br><br>"Wherefore, the&nbsp; heiress Narcisa de la Puente is hereby directed to deposit&nbsp; with this Court within ten (10)&nbsp; days from&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; of this&nbsp; order one half of the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P17,010.43&nbsp; together with the interest on the said half at the rate&nbsp; of 6 per cent per annum from March&nbsp; 11, 1945, until such deposit&nbsp; shall have been made."<br></blockquote>Hence&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>Appellant's main&nbsp; contention may&nbsp; be&nbsp; reduced&nbsp; to&nbsp; the following&nbsp; propositions:&nbsp; (1) that&nbsp; in&nbsp; deciding the claim in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Testate Estate of Crispulo&nbsp; Sideco the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; the Court of Appeals&nbsp; and this Court&nbsp; had&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the Judicial Administrator of this Estate, and not&nbsp; the heiresses thereof,&nbsp; to pay said claim; (2)&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; decision was&nbsp; final and&nbsp; executory&nbsp; and, therefore,&nbsp; cannot be amended by&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court as&nbsp; it was being done&nbsp; in the disputed order; (3) that&nbsp; in order to pay said&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; the real properties in the hands of the administrator should be sold and out&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; proceeds pay&nbsp; the Sideco&nbsp; claim;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; residuary cash&nbsp; in the hands of the heiresses, although&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; estate, never&nbsp; reached the hands of&nbsp; the Judicial Administrator in due course and,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; it cannot&nbsp; be used for&nbsp; the payment of the&nbsp; Sideco claim.<br><br>After a&nbsp; careful&nbsp; consideration, we&nbsp; find&nbsp; these contentions to be&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; We agree with the view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lower court that the residuary funds in the hands of the heiresses&nbsp; of this estate&nbsp; should be applied&nbsp; to the&nbsp; payment of the&nbsp; Sideco claim, for it is&nbsp; more advantageous&nbsp; to&nbsp; use that fund to pay the claim in question than selling the real properties&nbsp; of the estate&nbsp; for that purpose.&nbsp; Besides, section 3 of Rule 89&nbsp; of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>"The personal estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be first&nbsp; chargeable with the payment of&nbsp; debts and&nbsp; expenses; and&nbsp; if the personal estate is not sufficient for that purpose, or&nbsp; its&nbsp; sale would&nbsp; redound to the&nbsp; detriment&nbsp; of the participants in&nbsp; the estate,&nbsp; the whole&nbsp; of the real estate, or so much thereof as is necessary, may&nbsp; be sold, mortgaged,&nbsp; or otherwise&nbsp; encumbered for&nbsp; that purpose&nbsp; by&nbsp; the executor or. administrator, after obtaining&nbsp; the authority of&nbsp; the court therefor."<br></blockquote>And according&nbsp; to&nbsp; section 6&nbsp; of Rule 89, the Court has authority to fix the contributive shares of the&nbsp; devisees, legatees or heirs,for the payment of a claim if they&nbsp; have entered into possession of portions of the estate before the debts&nbsp; and expenses&nbsp; thereof have been settled and&nbsp; paid. Appellant&nbsp; argues, however, that&nbsp; section 3&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 89, Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court, is not applicable to the instant case on the ground that it refers to the&nbsp; personal and real properties of the deceased which are in the hands of the administrator, and not to the properties of the estate which are already in the hands of the heiresses.&nbsp; This contention is likewise untenable.&nbsp; The residuary funds in the&nbsp; hands of the&nbsp; appellant are funds of&nbsp; the estate&nbsp; and the Court has jurisdiction over them and, therefore, it could compel the appellant to deliver to the administrator of this estate the necessary portion of such fund for the payment of the Sideco claim.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; finding no errors in the order appealed from, the same are&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with costs against the&nbsp; appellant.<br><br><i>ParÃ¡s, C.
