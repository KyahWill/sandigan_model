				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The appellant, Filemon Escleto, was charged in the former 
People's Court with treason on three counts, namely:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. That during the period of Japanese military occupation of 
the Philippines, in the municipality of Lopez, Province of Tayabas, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, 
Filemon Escleto, with intent to give aid or comfort to the Imperial Japanese 
Forces in the Philippines, then enemies of the United States and of the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines, did wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and 
treasonably collaborate, associate and fraternize with the said Imperial 
Japanese Forces, going out with them in patrols in search of guerrillas and 
guerrilla hideouts, and of persons aiding or in sympathy with the resistance 
movement in the Philippines; bearing arms against the American and guerrilla 
forces in the furtherance of the war efforts of the Imperial Japanese Forces 
against the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and mounting 
guard and performing guard duty for the Imperial Japanese Forces in their 
garrison in the municipality of Lopez, Province of Tayabas, Philippines.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. That during the period of Japanese military occupation of 
the Philippines, in the municipality of Lopez, Province of Tayabas, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, 
Filemon Escleto, with intent to give aid or comfort to the Imperial Japanese 
Forces in the Philippines, then enemies of the United States and of the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines, did wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and 
treasonably accompany, join, and go out on patrols with Japanese soldiers in and 
aro und the municipality of Lopez, Province of Tayabas, in search of guerrillas 
and guerrilla hideouts, and of persons aiding or in sympathy with the resistance 
movement in the Philippines.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. That on or about the 18th day of March, 1944, in the 
municipality of Lopez, Province of Tayabas, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Filemon Escleto, 
with intent to give aid or comfort to the Imperial Japanese Forces in the 
Philippines, then enemies of the United States and of the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines, did wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and treasonably arrest and/or 
cause to be arrested one Antonio Conducto as a guerrilla and did turn him over 
and deliver to the Japanese military authorities in their garrison, since which 
time, that is, since the said 18th day of March, 1944, nothing has been heard 
from the said Antonio Conducto and is considered by his family to have been 
killed by the Japanese military authorities."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The court found "no concrete evidence as to defendant's 
membership in the U.N. or Makapili organization nor on what the patrols he 
accompanied actually did once they were out of town", and so was "constrained to 
rule that the evidence of the prosecution fails to establish, in connection with 
counts 1 and 2, any true overt act of treason." We may add that no two witnesses 
eoinfefcded in any specific acts of the defendant. The People's Court believed, 
however, "that the same evidence is sufficient to prove beyond question 
defendant's adherence to the enemy." </p>
<p align="justify">As to the 3rd count, the opinion of the People's Court was that 
it had been fully substantiated.</p>
<p align="justify">The record shows that on or about March 11, 1944, Japanese 
patrol composed of seventeen men and one officer was ambushed and totally 
liquidated by guerrillas in barrio Bibito, Lopez, province of Tayabas, now 
Quezon. As a result, some of the inhabitants of Bibito and neighboring barrios, 
numbering several hundred, were arrested and others were ordered to report at 
the <i>poblacion</i>. Among the latter were Antonio Conducto, a guerrilla and 
former USAFFE, Conducto's wife, parents and other relatives.</p>
<p align="justify">Sinforosa Mortero, 40 years old, testified that on March 18, 
1944, at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, in obedience to the Japanese order, 
she and the rest of her family went to the town from barrio Danlagan. Still in 
Danlagan, in fromt of Filemon Escleto's house, Escleto told them to stop and 
took down their names. With her were her daughter-in-law, Patricia Araya, her 
son Antonio Conducto, and three grandchildren. After writing their names, 
Escleto conducted them to the PC garrison in the <i>poblacion</i> where they 
were questioned by someone whose name she did not know. This man asked her if 
she heard gunshots and she said yes but did not know where it was. The next day 
they were allowed to go along with many others, but Antonio Conducto was not 
released. Since then she had not seen her son. On cross-examination she said 
that when Escleto took down their names Antonio Conducto asked the accused if 
anything would happen to him and his family, and Escleto answered, "Nothing will 
happen to you because I am going to accompany you in going to town."</p>
<p align="justify">Patricia Araya declared that before reaching the town, Filemon 
Escleto stopped her, her mother-in-law, her husband, her three children, her 
brother-in-law and the latter's wife and took down their names; that after 
taking down their names Escleto and a Philippine Constabulary soldier took them 
to the PC garrison; that her husband asked Escleto what would happen to him and 
his family, and Escleto said "nothing" and assured Conducto that he and his 
family would soon be allowed to go home; that Escleto presented them to a PC and 
she heard him tell the latter, "This is Antonio Conducto who has firearm;" that 
afterward they were sent upstairs and she did not know what happened to her 
husband.</p>
<p align="justify">The foregoing evidence fails to support the lower court's 
findings. It will readily be seen from a cursory examination thereof that the 
only point on which the two witnesses, Patricia Araya and Sinforosa Mortero, 
agree is that the accused took down the names of Conducto and of the witnesses, 
among others, and came along with them to the town. Granting the veracity of 
this statement, it does not warrant the inference that the defendant betrayed 
Conducto or had the intention of doing so. What he allegedly did was compatible 
with the hypothesis that, being lieutenant of his barrio, he thought it 
convenient as part of his duty to make a list of the people under his 
jurisdiction who heeded the Japanese order.</p>
<p align="justify">It was not necessary for the defendant to write Conducto's name 
in order to report on him. The two men appeared to be from the same barrio, 
Escleto knew Conducto intimately, and the latter was on his way to town to 
present himself. If the accused had a treasonable intent against Conducto, he 
could have furnished his name and identity to the enemy by word of mouth. This 
step would have the added advantage of concealing the defendant's traitorous 
action from his townmates and of not appraising Conducto of what was in store 
for him, knowledge of which might impel Conducto to escape.</p>
<p align="justify">That the list was not used for the purpose assumed by the 
prosecution is best demonstrated by the fact that it included, according to 
witnesses, Conducto's wife and parents and many others who were discharged the 
next day. The fact that, according to the evidence for the prosecution, spies 
wearing masks were utilized in the screening of guerrillas adds to the doubt 
that the defendant had a hand in Conducto's misfortune.</p>
<p align="justify">In short, Escleto's making note of persons who went to the 
<i>poblacion</i> as evidence of overt act is weak, vague and uncertain.</p>
<p align="justify">The only evidence against the appellant that might be 
considered direct and damaging is Patricia Araya's testimony that Escleto told a 
Philippine Constabulary soldier, "This is Antonio Conducto who has firearm." But 
the prosecution did not elaborate on this testimony, nor was any other witness 
made to corroborate it although Patricia Araya was with her husband, parents and 
relatives who would have heard the statement if the defendant had uttered it. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Leaving aside the question of Patricia's veracity, the failure 
to corroborate her testimony just mentioned makes it ineffective and unavailing 
as proof of an overt act of treason. In a juridical sense, this testimony is 
inoperative as a corroboration of the defendant's taking down of the name of 
Conducto and others, or vice-versa. It has been seen that the testimony was not 
shown to have been made for a treasonable purpose nor did it necessarily have 
that implication. This process of evaluating evidence might sound like a play of 
words but, as we have said in People vs. Adriano, (44 Off. Gaz., 4300<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>) the authors of the two-witness provision 
in the American Constitution, from which the Philippine treason law was taken, 
purposely made it "severely restrictive" and conviction for treason difficult. 
In that case we adverted to the following authorities, among others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Each of the witnesses must testify to the whole overt act; or 
if it is separable, there must be two witnesses to each part of the overt act." 
(VII Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., Sec. 2038, p. 271.)</p>
<p align="justify">"It is necessary to produce two direct witnesses to the 
<i>whole</i>, overt act. It may be passible to piece bits together of the same 
overt act; but, if so, <i>each bit</i> must have the support of two oaths; * * 
*." (Opinion of Judge Learned Hand quoted as footnote in Wigmore on Evidence, 
<i>ante</i>.)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The very minimum function that an overt act must perform in a 
treason prosecution is that it show sufficient action by the accused, in its 
setting, to sustain a finding that the accused actually gave aid and comfort to 
the enemy. Every <i>action, movement, deed,</i> and <i>word</i> of the defendant 
charged to constitute treason must be supported by the testimony of two 
witnesses." (Cramer vs. U. S. of A., 65 S. Ct. 918; 89 Law. ed., 1441.)</p>
<p align="justify">"It is not difficult to find grounds upon which to quarrel with 
this Constitutional provision. Perhaps the framers placed rather more reliance 
on direct testimony than:modern researches in psychology warrant. Or it may be, 
considered that such a quantitative measure of proof, such a mechanical 
calibration of evidence is a crude device at best that its protection of 
innocence is too fortuitous to warrant so unselective an obstacle to conviction. 
Certainly, the treason rule, whether wisely or not, is severely restrictive. It 
must be remembered, however, that the Constitutional Convention was warned by 
James Wilson that Treason may sometimes be practiced in such a manner, as to 
render proof extremely difficult—as in a traitorous correspondence with an 
Enemy. 'The provision was adopted not merely in spite of the difficulties it put 
in the way of prosecution but because of them. And it was not by whim or by 
accident, but because one of the most venerated of that venerated group 
considered that 'prosecutions for treason were generally virulent.' "(Cramer vs. 
U. S. of A., <i>supra</i>.)</p></blockquote>

reversed with costs <i>de oficio</i>.</p>

and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
