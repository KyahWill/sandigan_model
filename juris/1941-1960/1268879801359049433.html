				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In civil case No. 1007 of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, 
the petitioners, on December 10, 1948, obtained a judgment for P2,281.20 against 
the respondent Philippine Surplus Company under the Workmen's Compensation Act 
on account of the accidental death of their son vhich occurred in the 
performance of his duty as an employee of said company. The latter received copy 
of the decision on December 21, 1948.
<p>On January 10, 1949, <i>i.e.</i>, after the lapse of 15 days allowed by 
section 17 of Rule 41 for the perfection of an appeal in workmen's compensation 
cases, the respondent company filed a motion to set aside the judgment and to 
reopen the case on the ground that it had failed to receive the notice of the 
trial because its manager was then in Baguio. The court denied said motion on 
January 15, 1949, and on February 4 the respondent company filed a notice of 
appeal from the judgment, which was disallowed by the court on the ground that 
it was presented out of time. A motion for reconsideration of the order 
disallowing the appeal was subsequently filed and likewise denied by the 
court.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1949, the Philippine Surplus Company filed civil case No. 841 in 
the Court of First Instance of Rizal, seeking relief under section 2 of Rule 38 
from said judgment of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental and 
praying for a writ of preliminary Injunction to restrain the sheriff of Rizal 
City from complying with the writ of execution issued by the Court of First 
Instance of Negros Occidental. The respondent judge issued the writ of 
preliminary injunction prayed for, ordering the sheriff to abstain from 
executing the judgment in question during the pendency of the petition for 
relief from said judgment.</p>
<p>The present petition for prohibition was presented in this court to prohibit 
the respondent judge from hearing said petition for relief under section 2 of 
Rule 38 on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to take cognizance 
thereof.</p>
<p>Section 2 of Rule 38 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When a judgment or order is entered, or any other proceeding is taken, 
against a party in a Court of First Instance through fraud, accident, mistake, 
or excusable negligence, he may file a petition in such court <i>and in the same 
cause</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> praying that the judgment, 
order, or proceeding be set aside."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 3 provides that the petition must be filed within sixty days after 
the petitioner learns of the judgment and not more than six months after such 
judgment was entered; and must be accompanied by affidavits showing the fraud, 
accident, mistake, or excusable negligence relied upon, and the facts 
constituting the petitioner's good and substantial cause of action or defense, 
as the case may be, which he may prove if his petition be granted.</p>
<p>Section 4 provides that if the petition is sufficient in form and substance 
to justify such process, the court in which it is filed, or a judge thereof, 
shall issue an order requiring those against whom the petition is filed to 
answer it within fifteen days from the receipt thereof. </p>
<p>Section 6 provides that if tae petition is sufficient in form and substance 
to justify such process, the court in which it is filed, or a judge thereof, 
shall issue an order requiring those against whom the petition is filed to 
answer it within fifteen days from the receipt thereof. Section 6 provides that 
once the answer is filed, or the time for its filing has expired, the court 
shall hear the case, and if after such hearing the court finds the allegations 
of the petition are not true, the petition shall be dismissed; but if it finds 
said allegations to be true, it shall order the judgment complained of to be set 
aside, upon such terms as may be just, <i>and shall try the principal case upon 
its merits</i>.</p>
<p>Section 7 provides that where the judgment set aside is that of a Court of 
First Instance, such court shall proceed to hear and determine the case <i>as if 
a timely motion for new trial had been granted therein</i>.</p>
<p>It is clear from the foregoing provisions of Rule 38 that the petition for 
relief from a judgment of the Court of First Instance must be filed in the same 
court that rendered the judgment and in the same cause wherein the judgment was 
rendered; and that if the court finds the allegations of the petition to be 
true, it shall set aside the judgment and try the principal ease upon its merits 
as if a timely motion for new trial had been granted therein.</p>
<p>It results therefore, that the Court of First Instance of Rizal has no 
jurisdiction to hear and decide the petition for relief from the judgment of the 
Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental not only because section 2 of Rule 
38 expressly requires that such petition be filed in the latter court and in the 
same case but also because, although the principal case could have been 
originally brought either in the Court of First Instance of Rizal where the 
defendant has its domicile, or in the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental where the plaintiffs reside, once the latter court had taken 
cognizance of said case, it acquired jurisdiction to the exclusion of the 
former. To permit the Court of First Instance of Rizal to set aside the judgment 
rendered by the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental in civil case No. 
1007 and to try said case upon its merits, would produce the anomalous effect of 
depriving the latter court of the jurisdiction which it had already acquired 
over the case and of transferring that case to another court of the same 
category at the instance of the losing party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Equitable relief from a judgment may be granted by the court which rendered 
the judgment, where such court exercises jurisdiction both at law and in equity. 
Indeed, it has been held that such relief may not be granted by another court 
possessing the same jurisdiction as the court which rendered the judgment, or by 
another court possessing general equity jurisdiction." (31 Am. Jur., Judgments, 
sec. 628, p. 213.)</p></blockquote>
<p>As a matter of fact, the respondent company had exhausted all its remedies in 
the proper court, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, which had 
denied its motion of January 4, 1949, to set aside the judgment and to reopen 
the case, for lack of merit.</p>
<p>Let the writ of prohibition be issued as prayed for. The order of the 
respondent judge of May 31, 1949 granting the writ of preliminary injunction 
against the sheriff of Rizal City is hereby annulled. The respondent Philippine 
Surplus Company shall pay the costs.</p>
