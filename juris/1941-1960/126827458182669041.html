				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1761, August 24, 1949</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP JOSE LEELIN, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur pronounced Jose 
Leelin "entitled to become a Filipino citizen," and ordered the issuance of the 
corresponding naturalization certificate and its registration in the proper 
civil registry, as required in section 10 of Act No. 3753. The provincial fiscal 
appealed and the Solicitor General makes the following assignment of errors:<blockquote>
<p align="center">"I </p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The lower court erred in finding that appellee speaks and 
writes well English, Tagalog and Bicol, and in not finding he had failed to 
satisfactorily establish that he has this particular qualification prescribed by 
law.<br></p>
<p align="center">"II</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The lower court erred in not finding that appellee has failed 
to establish satisfactorily that the laws of China grant Filipinos the right to 
become naturalized citizens or subjects thereof and hence, he is disqualified 
for Philippine citizenship under section 4 (<i>h</i>) of the Revised 
Naturalization Law.</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">"III</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The lower court erred in considering Exhibits I and I-1, the 
same being immaterial, irrelevant and inconsistent with the present petition for 
naturalization, and, in granting appellee Philippine 
citizenship.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On the first assigned error, the undisputed evidence shows that 
the applicant was born on February 9, 1924, in Tigaon, Camarines Sur, of a 
Filipino mother and a Chinese father, and that he finished high school at Far 
Eastern University and went through the lower grades in the Tigaon Elementary 
School. The petitioner testified that he speaks and writes Tagalog, Bicol, 
English and a little Spanish, adding that the idioms spoken at home are Tagalog 
and Bicol. He also has shown that he is a merchant with an invested capital of 
not less than P5,000.</p>
<p align="justify">Applicant's positive assurance coupled with his schooling, his 
age and parentage, and his having been born in the Philippines and having lived 
in this country all his life, is more than satisfactory proof of his proficiency 
to a required degree in English, Tagalog and/or Bicol. If the opponent was not 
convinced by applicant's testimony, he himself could, and should, have subjected 
the petitioner to a practical test. Only thus could he confirm or dispel his 
doubts. An "actual demonstration" made at the instance of petitioner's attorney 
might be impugned as having been rehearsed.</p>
<p align="justify">On the second assigned error, it suffices to say that in 
previous cases, a translation of the Chinese Naturalization Law, made and 
certified to be correct by the Chinese Consulate General in Manila, was admitted 
and considered sufficient evidence to establish that the laws of China permit 
Filipinos to become citizens of that country.</p>
<p align="justify">The foregoing conclusions make superfluous a discussion of the 
third assignment of error.</p>
<p align="justify">The decision of the lower court is affirmed without costs.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
