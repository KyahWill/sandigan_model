				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari seeking to set aside the orders of 
respondent Commissioner dated September 11, 1954 and September 22, 1954 entered 
in Case No. 18045 of the Workmen's Compensation Commission and to have and order 
issue directing respondent Atanacio A. Mardo to refer the case to said 
Commission for review.
<p>Teresa Javier Vda. de Gonzales, et al., filed on April 22, 1952 with the 
Workmen's Compensation Commission a claim for compensation by reason of the 
death of one Maximino Gonzales, who was an employee of respondent Luzon 
Stevedoring Co., Inc. (Case No. 18045). The company, answering the claim, filed 
a motion to dismiss on the ground that the right of action of the claimants had 
already prescribed. This motion was denied, and, after hearing, the referee, 
Atanacio A. Mardo, rendered decision on February 23, 1954 ordering the company 
to pay the sums of P1,560 and P60, respectively, as compensation benefits and 
burial expenses to minors Antonio, Purification, Leonardo and Natividad, 
children of the deceased, but dismissing the case with regard to the claim of 
the widow and the children who had attained their age of majority before the 
filing of the claim with the Commission. On March 9, 1954, the company filed a 
motion for reconsideration insisting on its claim that the right of action of 
claimants had already prescribed, but the referee denied the motion in an order 
issued on April 1, 1954 wherein he neither amended nor modified his former 
decision.</p>
<p>On April 17, 1954, the company filed with the Supreme Court a petition to 
review by way of certiorari the decision of the referee, which petition was 
dismissed on the ground that "the decision involved is merely that of the 
referee, and under section 46 of Republic Act No. 772, appeal to the Supreme 
Court should be from the decision of the Commissioner." On May 19, 1954, 
following the suggestion of this Court, the company filed with the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission a motion praying that the referee be ordered to refer 
the case to said Commission for review inasmuch as said referee in denying said 
motion for reconsideration neither amended nor modified his former decision. 
This motion was denied in an order entered on September 11, 1954 on the ground 
that the decision sought to be reviewed had already become final. Its motion for 
reconsideration having been denied, the company interposed the present petition 
for certiorari.</p>
<p>The question to be determined is whether the decision of the referee dated 
February 23, 1954 had already become final when petitioner filed its motion 
praying that the case be referred to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for 
review under section 49, Act No. 3428,. as amended by Republic Act No. 772.</p>
<p>Said Section 49 provides in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any party in interest who is dissatisfied with the order entered by the 
referee may petition to review the same and the referee may reopen said case, or 
may amend or modify said order, and such t mended or modified order shall be a 
final award unless objection be made thereto by petition for review. In case 
said referee does not amend or modify said order, he shall refer the entire case 
to the Commissioner, who shall thereupon review the entire record in said case, 
and, in his discretion, may take or order the taking of additional testimony, 
and shall make his findings of facts and enter his award thereon. The award of 
the Commissioner shall be final unless a petition to review same shall be filed 
by an interested party. Every petition for review shall be in writing and shall 
specify in detail the particular errors and objections. Such petition must be 
filed within fifteen days after the entry of any referee's order or award of the 
Commissioner unless further time is granted by the referee or the Commissioner 
within said fifteen days. All parties in interest shall be given due notice of 
the entry of any referee's order or any award of the Commissioner, and said 
period of fifteen days shall begin to run only after such notice, and the 
mailing of a copy of said order or award addressed to the last known address of 
any party in interest shall be sufficient notice."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear from the above provision that any party in interest who is 
dissatisfied with the order issued by the referee <em>may petition to 
review</em> the same and the referee may re-open said case, or may amend or 
modify said order, and such amended or modified order shall be a final award 
unless objection be made thereto by petition for review. In case said referee 
does not amend or modify said order, he shall refer the entire case to the 
Commissioner, who shall thereupon review the entire record of said case. The 
award of the Commissioner shall be final unless a petition to review is filed by 
an interested party. The law also provides that every petition for review shall 
be in writing and must be filed within 15 days after the entry of the referee's 
order or award of the Commissioner unless further time is granted.</p>
<p>In the instant case, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the 
order of the referee granting compensation benefits to some of the claimants 
well within the period of 15 days after its entry, and the referee did not amend 
nor modify his original decision but merely reiterated it. Such being the case, 
the duty of the referee was to refer the entire case to the Commissioner in 
order that it may review the case as provided for by law. The referee failed to 
comply with this duty which motivated the petitioner to file a motion with the 
Commission in order that such duty may be performed. Respondent Commission 
denied said motion on the mistaken belief that the decision of the referee had 
already become final. This is an error which amounts to an abuse of 
discretion.</p>
<p>It is true that the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration instead of 
a petition for review as required by the law, but in our opinion this is a mere 
technical error which cannot affect the nature of the motion for reconsideration 
filed by petitioner for, in effect, its purpose is to seek a review of the 
decision of the referee. It is therefore evident that said decision had not yet 
become final when petitioner filed its motion to refer the entire case to the 
Commission and, hence, respondent Commissioner committed an abuse of discretion 
when he denied said motion.</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is granted. Respondent Commissioner is hereby directed to 
have the entire record of the case referred to the Commission for review as 
provided for by law, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Concepcion</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition granted.</em></p></div>
