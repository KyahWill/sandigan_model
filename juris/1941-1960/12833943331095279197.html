				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">From the decision of the Public Service Commission in PSC Cases 
Nos. 103908 and 104384, allowing Pedro Lat and Angeles Lat to install, 
operate and maintain, in addition to their original 2-ton ice plant, a 
5-ton unit in Digos, Davao, and dismissing the application of Romulo V. 
Ramos for a certificate of public convenience for the same purpose, the 
latter appealed to this Court by way of the instant petitions for 
certiorari in the two cases, questioning the findings of the Commission 
that the spouses Pedro and Angeles Lat, who were holders of a 
certificate of public convenience for the same purpose, the latter 
appealed to this Court  by way of the instant petitions for certiorari 
in the two cases, questioning the findings of the Commission that the 
spouses Pedro and Angeles Lat, who were holders of a certificate of 
public convenience since 1949, had been rendering adequate and efficient
 service, thus justifying the granting of their application for the 
installation and operation of an additional 5-ton unit.
  <p>  On February 7, 1957, Romulo V. Ramos filed an application with 
the Public Service Commission (PBC Case No. 103908) for a certificate of
 public convenience to install, operate and maintain in the municipality
 of Digos, province of Davao, an ice plant with a daily productive 
capacity of 5 tons, and for the sale and distribution of ice not only in
 Digos but also in the adjoining municipalities of Sta. Cruz, Dansalan, 
Hagonoy, Padada and Malalag, all of the same province.</p>
  <p>  This application was opposed by Pedro M. Lat and Angeles O. Lat, 
grantees of certificates of public convenience to operate ice plants not
 only in Digos, but also in Davao City and Magugpo, in the province of 
Davao, for the reasons that the ice plants owned by them were actually 
producing ice more than sufficient to meet the demands of the public; 
that oppositors had already filed, in Case No. 104384 (on February 19, 
1957), an application to increase the daily capacity of their ice plant 
in Digos from 2 tons to 7 tons, which application was already heard by 
the Commission; and that to grant the application of Ramos would only 
cause ruinous competition. At the request of applicant Ramos, the 
Justice of the Peace of Digos, Davao, was commissioned to receive the 
evidence for applicant and oppositors.</p>
  <p>  The records show that on February 18 of the same year, the 
spouses Pedro and Angeles Lat sought authorization from the Public 
Service Commission (in PSC Case No. 104384) to increase the daily 
capacity of their ice plant in Digos, Davao, covered by a certificate of
 public convenience granted in 1949, from 2 tons to 7 tons, and to sell 
and distribute ice not only in the municipalities of Digos, Sta. Cruz, 
Limonso and Padada, but also in the municipality of Malalag (Davao). A 
the hearing of the aforesaid application, Romulo Y. Ramos appeared and 
opposed the same, on the ground that the purpose of the applicants Lat 
apparently was to control or monopolize the distribution of ice in 
Davao.</p>
  <p>  Considering the two applications and the oppositions thereto 
jointly, the Public Service Commission rendered a decision, in part 
reading as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"The need for the additional production in Digos is not at issue 
here. The evidence clearly establishes that there is a need for more ice
 for use in Digos and the towns proposed by the applicants in view of 
the development of the fishing industry in those towns and the 
considerable increase in population. It appears that there is an overall
 population of about 60,000 people in all the towns which will be served
 by the ice plant in Digos. The evidence of both applicants also 
establish those need, and the only question is which of the two 
applicants should be allowed the additional production considering that 
we believe that there is no need for allowing both applicants to put up a
 plant of 5 tons each. Applicant Ramos had adduced evidence to show that
 operators Pedro and Angeles Lat have been negligent in rendering their 
service and that they have overlooked the increasing or growing needs of
 the public for ice and that the Lats did not think of applying for 
additional production until they know that applicant Ramos had filed his
 application for a 5-ton plant. We do not find this contention correct 
because the evidence shows that as early as October, 1956 applicants Lat
 instructed their counsel in Manila to file an application for an 
additional 5-ton unit to be installed in Digos and the corresponding 
order for the equipment was placed with the Industrial Equipment 
Company, and in the letter of that company to Pedro Lat dated September 
29, 1956 the former quoted to the latter specifications for a 5-ton unit
 pursuant to the request made by said Padro Lat. This evidence confirms 
the claim of the applicants that they took steps even before the filing 
of the Ramos application to put up an additional unit in Digos. There is
 also the claim of the applicant Ramos that the Lats are no longer 
interested in their Digos plant because they have sold the land where 
the plant is installed to another party. There is such a deed of sale of
 the land but this fact certainly does not prove that the Lats have 
given up the operation of their ice plant because the land may be sold 
but they may still retain the ownership of the plant, and that this is 
so is shown by circumstance that they are willing to put up an 
additional investment of about P80,000.00 to increase the production of 
the plant. We also find satisfactory the evidence of applicants Lat that
 they have been rendering ice delivery service in Digos and the other 
towns whenever such service was needed by the public. In consonance with
 the principle that, all things being equal, the pioneer operator is 
entitled to preference in authorizing an additional service in his 
territory when such service is shown to be needed by the public there 
being no showing that the Lats have been negligent or careless in 
attending to the needs of the public, we believe that in the present 
cases the authority for the additional 5-ton production should, as it is
 hereby, given to applicants Pedro and Angeles Lat for authority to 
increase the capacity of their ice plant in Digos by 5 additional tons, 
and dismissing the application of Romulo V. Ramos."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Petitioner admits that the question raised herein is purely 
factual, and, fully aware of the definite stand of this Court in appeals
 of this nature,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> he claims 
that the finding of the Public Service Commission is not supported by 
evidence, thus justifying the removal of these cases from the sphere of 
application of the general rule. As we have already held,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> where the appeal from a 
decision of the Public Service Commission involves factual findings, the
 only question that should be determined is whether the evidence on 
record substantially supports said findings and conclusions, without 
necessity of examining the proof <u>de novo</u> to find out whether such
 findings or conclusions are supported by preponderant evidence.</p>
  <p>    In controverting the findings of the Commission in the cases at
 bar, petitioner insists that it failed to take into account the facts 
that there were occasions when, to replenish their stock in Digos, 
respondents had to get the excess ice produced by their ice plant in 
Davao City; that no ice deliveries were being made by the respondents; 
and that although they were grantees of a certificate of public 
convenience since 1949, respondents sought authority to increase the 
capacity of their ice plant in Digos only in 1957, although the 
population of the affected areas had allegedly been increasing since 
1949. After considering these allegations, which were already made and 
presented by petitioner during the hearing, the Public Service 
Commission expressly found the services rendered by respondents 
satisfactory. This conclusion is evidently based, on the one hand, on 
the testimony of Pedro Lat and his witness, Eufronio Felix — tending to 
establish the sufficiency and efficiency of the services of respondents 
in the past, and the need for the increase of the same to meet the 
growing demand of the public for the commodity — and, on the other, the 
absence of evidence, other than petitioner's own testimony, to prove the
 alleged negligence and indifference of respondents to the needs of the 
public. Under the circumstances, we perceive no reason to disturb the 
finding of the Commission in these cases and substitute the same with 
one of our own.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with 
costs against the petitioner in both instances.</p>
  <p>    So ordered.</p>
