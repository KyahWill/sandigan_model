				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by certiorari under Rule 46 from a judgment of the Court of Appeals 
(C. A.—G. R. No. 22136-R).
<p>Remedios Cuenco Borromeo, as administratrix of the estate of the late Teofilo 
Borromeo, brought an action against Tomas L. Borromeo in the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu praying for accounting, liquidation and payment of her late 
husband's share in the proceeds of the war damage claim paid to and received by 
the defendant as his attorney-in-fact and of the sum of P17,100 as moral and 
actual damages and attorney's fees (Civil No. R-5031, Annex A, C.A.-G.R. No. 
22136-R). The defendant answered the complaint denying the plaintiff's claim and 
averring that such share has been fully paid to Teofilo Borromeo (Annex B, 
C.A.—G. R. No. 22136-R). Aside from this case, there were pending in the same 
Court Civil No. R-3808, entitled "Estate of Vito Borromeo <em>vs</em>. Tomas 
Borromeo." and special proceedings No. R-916, entitled "Testate Estate of Vito 
Borromeo." For the convenience of Attorney Crispin D. Baizas, counsel for Tomas 
L. Borromeo in Civil No. R. 5031 and special proceedings No. R-916 who resided 
and had his law office in Manila, by agreement of the parties the hearing of the 
case and special proceedings was set by the Court to enable Attorney Baizas to 
be in Cebu City on consecutive days. The hearing of Civil No. R-5031 was set for 
9 July 1957 and of special proceedings No. R—916 for 10, 11 and 12 July 1957. On 
8 July 1957 Attorney Baizas received by mail a copy of an urgent motion dated 5 
July 1957 of the Solicitor General, who represented the Government in the 
special proceedings, praying for postponement of the hearing set for 10, 11 and 
12 July 1957 (Annex C, C.A.-G.R, No. 22136-R). Attorney Baizas, who had 
previously made reservation with the Philippine Air Lines to fly to Cebu City, 
cancelled his reservation and wired Attorney Filiberto Leonardo (who was 
collaborating with him in handling the cases) in Cebu City, requesting him to 
ask for postponement of the hearing of Civil No. R-5031, which he referred to in 
the telegram as the "Cuenco Case," or, should the Court deny his request, to 
appear in his behalf at the trial of the case. On 9 July, Attorney Leonardo, 
believing that the "Cuenco Case" referred to by Attorney Baizas in his telegram 
was Civil No. R-8808, proceeded to the Court presided over by Hon. Edmundo 
Piccio but after reading the court calendar found that Civil No. R-3808 was not 
set for hearing on that day. So he went home. For that reason, when Civil No. 
R-5031 was called for hearing at the Court presided over by Hon. Jose S. 
Rodriguez, neither the defendant Tomas L. Borromeo nor his counsel appeared, and 
the plaintiff Remedios Cuenco Borromeo was allowed to present her evidence. On 
11 July 1957 the Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff and against the 
defendant, copy of which was received by counsel for the defendant on 2 August 
1957 (Annex B, C.A.-G.R. No. 22136). On 29 August 1957 the defendant filed a 
verified motion for new trial, dated 26 August 1957, on the ground of mistake or 
excusable neglect, supported by affidavits of merit attached thereto (Annexes B, 
E-1 and E-2, C.A.-G.R. No. 22136). On 13 September 1957, the Court denied the 
defendant's motion for new trial (Annex F, C.A.-G.R. No. 22136), copy of which 
was received by counsel for the defendant on 23 September 1957. On 17 October 
1957, or 24 days after-receipt of a copy of the order denying his motion for new 
trial, the defendant perfected his appeal from the last mentioned order. In a 
motion dated 21 October 1957, copy of which counsel for the defendant received 
on 26 October 1957, the plaintiff prayed for the dismissal of the appeal on the 
ground that it was filed beyond the regle-mentary period (Annex H, C.A.-G.R. No. 
22136). On 29 October 1957 the defendant filed an objection thereto stating that 
he was appealing from the order dated 13 September 1957 denying his motion for 
new trial, and not from the judgment dated 11 July 1957 (Annex I, C.A.-G.R. No. 
22136). The Court set the hearing of the plaintiff's motion to dismiss on 26 
October 1957 and thereafter on the same day entered an order as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finding the motion of counsel for the plaintiff dated October 21, 1957, well 
founded, it appearing that the appeal filed by the defendant was presented 
outside of the 30 day period for appeal, it was filed after 44th day as shown by 
the records, as prayed for, the appeal filed by the defendant is hereby 
Dismissed (Annex J, C. A.—G.R. No. 22136).</p></blockquote>
<p>On 6 November 1957 the defendant moved for reconsideration of the foregoing 
order, reiterating that his appeal was from the order dated 13 September 1957 
denying his motion for new trial and not from the judgment dated 11 July 1957 
(Annex K, C.A.-G.R. No. 22136) ; the plaintiff, an objection thereto (Annex L, 
C.A.-G.R. No. 22136). On 2 December 1957 the defendant received a copy of an 
order dated 25 November 1957 denying his motion for reconsideration (Annex M, 
C.A.-G.R. No. 22136); on 23 December 1959 the defendant filed a petition for a 
writ of certiorari in the Court of Appeals praying that after hearing the order 
dated 26 October 1957 dismissing his appeal from the denial of his motion for 
new trial be set aside. (C.A.-G.R. No. 22136). He also prayed that after filing 
the requisite bond, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued enjoining the 
respondent court from issuing a writ of execution of the judgment rendered in 
Civil No. R-5031. After he had posted a bond in the sum of P1,000, the Court of 
Appeals issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for. On 28 February 
1958 the Court of Appeals rendered judgment, the dispositive part of which 
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 5031, is 
set aside, and the respondent judge should be, as he is hereby ordered, to grant 
the new trial prayed for and permit the petitioner to present such evidence as 
may be lawfully warranted and relevant in the premises. The injunction issued 
heretofore, is made permanent, without special pronouncement as to 
costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The herein respondent, petitioner in the Court of Appeals, insists that he is 
appealing from the order dated 13 September 1957, denying his motion for new 
trial and not from the judgment dated 11 July 1957.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the facts set forth in the motion for new trial 
supported by affidavits attached thereto and the answer filed by the herein 
respondent Tomas L. Borromeo in the Court of First Instance of Cebu where he 
denies the claim of the herein petitioner, plaintiff in the said Court, and 
avers that the claim for war damage of the late Teofilo Borromeo, husband of the 
herein petitioner, has been fully paid to him, said motion may be deemed one 
filed under Rule 38, of the Rules of Court. A denial thereof is final and 
appealable. The period for taking an appeal from a denial of a motion praying 
for the setting aside of a judgment or order rendered or entered against a party 
through fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence is thirty days from 
the receipt of a copy of such judgment or order. Indeed, it would be futile to 
appeal from the judgment sought to be set aside by a motion for relief under 
Rule 38, because the aggrieved party would have no evidence upon which to rely 
to secure a reversal of the judgment sought to be set aside by a motion for 
relief under Rule 38, unless he would rely for its reversal on insufficiency or 
perhaps inherent improbability of the evidence presented by the winning party. 
The appeal by the herein respondent Tomas L. Borromeo from the order denying his 
motion for relief had been taken within the reglementary period and should have 
been allowed.</p>
<p>The judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals under review granting the writ 
prayed for by the herein respondent Tomas L. Borromeo should be, as it is 
hereby, affirmed, with costs against the herein petitioner Remedios Cuenco Vda, 
de Borromeo.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed.</em></p></div>
