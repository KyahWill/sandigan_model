				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The herein appellant  was found guilty by  the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga of the  crime  of  murder without any  aggravating or  mitigating  circumstance and sentenced to suffer the penalty  of <em>reclusion perpetua,</em> with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, to pay an  indemnity of P6,000 to the heirs  of the deceased Moro Hadjirol,  and to  pay the costs.  He appealed from this decision on the ground that the court erred  (1)  in rejecting the plea of  self-defense;  (2)  in  finding the appellant guilty  beyond reasonable doubt of the  crime  of  murder qualified by treachery and assuming that he is guilty thereof; and (3) in not taking into consideration the mitigating circumstances attending the commission of  the  offense charged against him.</p>
<p>Carefully  considered, the issue involved in this case narrows down to the credibility  of witnesses or, to be more exact,  whether the version about the incident given  by the witnesses for the defense should be believed instead of that  of the prosecution to which the  lower court gave credence.  The lower court gave more weight to  the witnesses for the prosecution and thus reached the conclusion that  the herein  appellant is guilty of the crime  charged in the information.  It found that during a market day, in the afternoon of June 22, 1952, the appellant and his companion Moro Matangon arrived  at a private  market owned and operated by Moro Tamsi in the sitio  of Bulibul,  Lamitan District,  Basilan  City.  They approached a stall  of one Amil alias Amilhanja and asked the latter for the price of one bundle of fish.   Amilhanja told them that the price was P0.80.  Moro Matangon tried to  bargain for P0.50; Amilhanja did not agree, hence Moro Matangon could not buy the fish.  He stood,  however, near the stall and  when other customers came  to  buy fish and asked for the price  of each bundle and Amilhanja gave the price of P0.80,  Moro  Matangon  remarked: "This is the only Moro Samal who is hard-headed and  does not like to lower the price of his fish" and immediately cut into small pieces or minced all  the fish Amilhanja was selling.  Thereupon the latter went at once to report the incident to Moro Tamsi who  intervened  and ordered Moro Matangon to pay the price of the fish he destroyed.   Matangon refused to pay, so Moro Tamsi requested the mother of Moro Matangon, who  was at that time  present, to  pay to Amilhanja and, when she was already willing to pay the price of the fish, Moro Matangon told his mother not  to do it or intervene and that if she would pay he would  kill her. At this juncture, Moro Tamsi told Moro Matangon not to be stubborn and pay; in answer, the latter unsheathed his pira (a kind of bolo)  and  tried to strike at Moro Amilhanja.  Moro Tamsi stopped him and wrested from him his pira.  When  the  appellant Moro Jumdatal saw  that Moro Tamsi was  able to disarm his companion Matangon, he unsheathed his barong and wanted to strike at everybody, but he  was stopped  by the people  present  in  the market.  Right away Moro Matangon and  Moro Jumdatal left the market taking a trail towards the interior of the place.  Meanwhile Moro Tamsi told Amilhanja to take his vinta and sail out to the sea in order to avoid further trouble with Matangon and Jumdatal.  Heeding this advice, Moro Amilhanja left the place accompanied by moro Tamsi. When Moro Matangon and Jumdatal were about 70  brazas from the market place and they met on the trail Moro Hadjirol, an  old man of 80  years, who  was  going  to  the market, Moro Jumdatal suddenly hacked  Moro Hadjirol with his barong, the blow landing on  the latter's  right shoulder and penetrating his upper right arm, the clavicle  and the right armpit  and as a result thereof Moro Hadjirol died right in the spot a few moments after.  After giving  the blow, appellant  Jumdatal  and  his  companion Matangon ran away.  Mora Mihilan, who  was at the place and saw what happened to her father, shouted for help; Moro Tamsi, who  was on his  way back to the market, heard the voice of Mora Mihilan and the  two went to the place where Moro Hadjirol was attacked, but there they no longer saw Moros Jumdatal and Matangon, instead  they  found Hadjirol already dead.</p>
<p>The witnesses for the defense testified  to the effect that in the  afternoon  of June 22, 1952, appellant Moro Jumdatal, accompanied by Moro Matangon, went  to sitio Bulibuli to look for  his carabao which  has  been stolen days before.  In that place they met Yakan Urin  accompanied by Kintalan who  was also in search of  a stolen carabao. At about 20 brazas from the  house of Moro  Hadjirol, Moro  Jumdatal  and  Moro  Matangon  found inside  the bushes there the carabao Jumdatal was looking for; then Jumdatal untied the carabao and led it towards the road. Hadjiroi noticed it and together with Abdurasid  ran after Jumdatal and his companion Matangon.  Hadjiroi was armed with a kris and Abdurasid with a spear and barong. Upon overtaking Moros Jumdatal and Matangon, Hadjiroi took hold of the ring attached to the nose of  the  carabao with  his left hand  while his right  and  was  resting on his kris.  Jumdatal then took hold of the rope of the carabao with his left  hand while his right hand was holding his barong.  While  Jumdatal  and  Hadjiroi were in this position, Abdurasid went behind Jumdatal and in that precise moment Moro Tamsi arrived and grabbed the pira of Matangon and ordered Abdurasid to attack Jumdatal.  Abdurasid at once thrust his spear at Jumdatal,  hitting the latter on the left buttock, the spear penetrating through and through such that its point came out of the left leg. Upon receiving  the blow of Abdurasid, Jumdatal unsheathed his barong,  hit  Hadjiroi  on the  right shoulder and immediately ran  to  the bushes followed by  Matangon, Yakan Urin and Kintalan.  The next day Jumdatal was taken to the house of his uncle Yakan Jabaran whom he informed that Abdurasid  was responsible for the spearthrust on his left buttock.  Yakan Jabaran then  went to Lieut. Coile to  report the incident  and the latter  ordered him to bring Jumdatal  to him.  Yakan Jabaran answered, however, that Jumdatal could not  walk,  so Lieut. Caoile told  him to bring Jumdatal  as  soon as his  wound was healed.  Yakan Jabaran also reported the  incident to counselor  Pamaran  who told him to buy medicines, which he did.   Moro Jumdatal remained under treatment for  over a  month and after recovering from his wound,  Yakan Jabaran brought him to Lieut. Caoile and counselor Pamaran at Mangal, but then the  latter told them to go home as he would think over the case as Jumdatal was, after all, the innocent party, so both Yakan Jabaran and Moro Jumdatal went  home.</p>
<p>The appellant vigorously contends in  this instance that he inflicted the  fatal blow on  Moro  Hadjirol in the defense of his person because he was attack by Abdurasid, a companion of  Moro Hadjirol, but the lower court gave no credence to this defense on the ground that it is unbelievable.   We have examined the evidence on record and we  find the  lower court correct in not giving credence to appellant's pretension.  Firstly, because if the appellant was attack by  Abdurasid, his  natural  reaction  would be not to give a blow to Hadjirol, who was not  attacking him, but to Abdurasid who speared him; yet the evidence for the defense  tended  to show  the contrary.   Secondly, the herein  appellant and his witnesses testified that Jumdatal was able to run away and escape from the  place; but, according to appellant, the spear of Abdurasid penetrated through and through his buttock and its point came out of the left leg so that the  wound  inflicted on Jumdatal by Abdurasid was so serious that had he suffered such injury he would not be able even to walk; yet according to the defense,  he was  able to run away after inflicting the fatal blow on the deceased.  Thirdly, were it true, as the defense  so pretends, that in the incident at bar Moro Tamsi was armed  with a kris and Moro  Abdurasid with  a  barong  and spear while Matangon, had no arm and  the  appellant had only his barong, the appellant herein would not escape death in the  hands of Moros Tamsi and Abdurasid who were then bent  to attack him, especially because he was already wounded on his  left buttock and alone, he was no  match to Adburasid and Tamsi in that occasion; yet, according to the defense, nothing happened to the herein appellant  after he  had hacked the deceased Hadjirol.   Fourthly, the  appellant herein did not file nor caused the filing of an action against Moros Abdurasid and Tamsi.   Were it  true  that he  was speared by Abdurasid  upon order of  Moro Tamsi, his failure to file action against the latter and Moro Abdurasid is more than sufficient ground to doubt  his testimony  and that of his witnesses  on the matter.  On the other hand, the evidence shows that immediately after the incident, it was Datu  Mohamad, the son-in-law of the deceased Hadjirol, who  immediately reported the incident to Sgt. Ibno of the Lamitan police  station and thus the present  case was initiated against the herein appellant.  Fifthly, Lieut. Caoile and "counselor Pamaran were jiot presented by the defense to corroborate the alleged report Yakan Jabaran made about the incident as to how it  happened, and this fact coupled with the failure of the herein appellant to take action against Abdurasid  and Tamsi constitute  another ground for doubting  the testimony of the herein appellant and  his witness Yakan Jabaran.  Sixthly,  according  to the  defense, Moro  Tamsi  suddenly appeared at the place of the  incident and  instructed Abdurasid to attack the herein appellant.  There is no showing about the relations between Abdurasid and Tamsi or the relations of the latter with  the deceased Hadjirol or the interest of Tamsi in the carabao which apjtellant claims to have been found near the house of the deceased.  In the absence of evidence on  these points, it is  quite  hard  to believe that Moro Tamsi did really  appear at the scene of  the crime and  gave orders to Abdurasid to attack the herein appellant.  Accordingly, between the version given by  the prosecution" and  that given  by the defense,  we find it more reasonable to  believe in the  former than in  the latter and,  therefore, we find  no reason for disturbing  the decision  appealed from.</p>
<p>It is also contended by the appellant that the crime at bar should  be considered only as homicide instead of murder, but it  is undisputable that a sudden attack constitutes treachery and,  in this particular case, the evidence conclusively shows that the herein appellant suddenly attacked the deceased Hadjirol without  the slightest provocation on the part of the latter; hence, appellant was properly found guilty of  murder and sentenced  accordingly.</p>
<p>In People <em>vs.</em> Dosal, (92 Phil., 877), April 17, 1953, we held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"As appellant met the deceased walking along the street appellant suddenly and  without warning pulled out  a bolo under his  shirt and with full strength thrust it upon the body of Fernandez.  Fernandez fled and  appellant continued to chase him and struck him again until he finally fell.  There is no doubt that the sudden attack made upon Fernandez  without any warning was accompanied  by treachery thereby qualifying the killing as murder."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, finding no  errors in the decision appealed from the same is hereby affirmed in toto.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor,  Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</em> and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.,</em>  concur.</p>
