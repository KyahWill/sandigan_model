				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March  16, 1926, the accused Rodolfo A.  Schneckenburger married the complainant Elena Ramirez  Cartagena and after seven years of marital life,  they agreed, for reason of alleged incompatibility of character, to live separately from each other.  And on May 25, 1935 they executed a document which in part recites as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Que ambos comparecientes convienen en vivir separados el uno del otro por el resto de su vida  y se comprometen, y obligan reciprocamente a  no molestarse  ni intervenir ni mezclarse bajo ningun concepto en la vida publica o privada de los mismos, entre si; quedando cada  uno de los otorgantes en completa libertad  de accion en cualquier acto y en todos conceptos."<br></blockquote><br>On June 15, 1935,  the accused Schneckenburger, without leaving the Philippines, secured a decree of divorce from the civil court of Juarez, Bravos District,  State of  Chihuahua, Mexico.   On  May 11, 1936, he contracted another marriage with his co-accused, Julia Medel, in the justice of the peace court of Malabon, Rizal, and since  then they lived together as  husband and wife in the  City  of  Manila.  Because of the nullity of the divorce decreed by the Mexico Court, complainant  herein instituted two actions against the accused, one for bigamy in the  Court of First Instance of Rizal and the other for concubinage in the Court of First Instance of Manila.  The first culminated in the conviction of the accused for which he was sentenced to a penalty of two months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>.  On the trial for the offense of concubinage, accused  interposed the plea of double jeopardy, and the case was dismissed; but, upon appeal by the fiscal, this Court  held  the dismissal before trial to be premature (this was under the former procedure) and without deciding the question of double jeopardy, remanded the case to the trial  court for trial on  the  merits.  Accused was convicted of  concubinage through reckless imprudence and sentenced to a penalty of two months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>.  Hence this appeal.<br><br>As to appellant's plea of double jeopardy, it need only be observed that the offense of bigamy  for which he  was convicted and that of concubinage for which he stood trial in the court below are two distinct offenses in law and in fact as well as in the mode of their  prosecution.  The celebration of the second marriage, with the first still  existing, characterizes the crime of bigamy;  on the other  hand, in the present case,  mere cohabitation by the husband with a woman who is not his wife characterizes the crime of concubinage.  The first is an offense against civil status which may be prosecuted at the instance of the state; the second, an  offense against chastity and may  be prosecuted only at the instance  of the offended party.  And no  rule is  more settled in law than that, on the matter of double jeopardy, the test is not whether  the defendant has already been tried for the same act,  but whether he has been put in jeopardy  for the  same offense.  (Diaz <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>. U. S., 223 U. S., 422; People <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>. Cabrera, 43 Phil., 82)<br><br>Upon the  other hand,  we believe  and so hold  that the accused should be acquitted of the crime of  concubinage. The document executed by and between the accused and the complainant  in which they agreed to be "en completa libertad de  accidn  en cualquier acto y en todos conceptos," while  illegal for the purpose for which it was executed, constitutes nevertheless a valid  consent to the act of concubinage within the meaning of section 344 of the Revised Penal Code.  There can be no doubt that  by such agreement, each party clearly intended to forego the illicit acts of the other.<br><br>We said before (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Guinucod, 58 Phil., 621) that the consent which bars the offended party from instituting a criminal prosecution in  cases  of adultery, concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape and acts of lasciviousness is that which has been given expressly or impliedly after the crime has been  committed.  We  are now convinced that this is a narrow view in no  way warranted by the language, as well as the manifest policy, of the law.  The second paragraph of  article 344 of the Revised  Penal  Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>"The offended party cannot institute criminal prosecution without including both the guilty parties, if they are both alive, nor,  in any case, if he shall  have<span style="font-style: italic;"> consented</span> or<span style="font-style: italic;"> pardoned </span> the offenders."  (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote><br>As  the  term "pardon" unquestionably refers to the offense<span style="font-style: italic;"> after</span>  its commission, "consent" must have been intended,  agreeably with its ordinary usage,  to refer to the offense prior to  its commission.  No logical difference can indeed be perceived  between prior and subsequent consent, for in both  instances as the offended party has chosen to compromise with his/her  dishonor, he/she  becomes  unworthy to come to court and invoke its aid in the vindication of the wrong.  For instance, a husband who delivers his wife to another man for adultery, is as unworthy, if not more, as where, upon  acquiring knowledge  of the adultery after its commission, he says  or does nothing.  We, therefore, hold that prior consent is as effective as subsequent consent to bar  the offended  party from prosecuting the offense.<br><br>In arriving at this conclusion we do not  wish to be misconstrued as legalizing an agreement to  do  an illicit act, in violation  of law.  Our view must be taken only  to mean that an agreement  of the tenor entered into  between the parties herein, operates, within the plain language and manifest  policy of the law, to bar  the offended party  from prosecuting the offense.  If there is anything morally condemnatory in a situation  of this character, the remedy lies not with us but with the legislative department of the government.  What the law is, not what it should be, defines the limits  of our authority.<br><br>Judgment is reversed and  the  accused is hereby acquitted, without costs.<br><br><br><i>Avancena, C.J., Abad  Santos, Diaz,</i> and <i>Horrilleno, JJ</i>., concur.<br><i>Laurel</i> and<i> Ozaeta, JJ</i>., took no part.</div>
