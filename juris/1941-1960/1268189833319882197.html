				<H3>ANTONINA CUEVAS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT VS. CRISPULO CUEVAS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On September 18, 1950, Antonina Cuevas executed a notarized conveyance 
entitled "Donacion Montis Causa," ceding to her nephew Crispulo Cuevas the 
northern half of a parcel of unregistered land in barrio Sinasajan, municipality 
of Peñaranda, Province of Nueva Ecija (Exhibit A). In the same instrument 
appears the acceptance of Crispulo Cuevas.
<p>"Subsequently, on May 26,1952, the donor executed another notarial instrument 
entitled "Eevocaci6n de Donacion Mortis Causa" (Exhibit B) purporting to set 
aside the preceding conveyance; and on August 26, 1952, she brought action in 
the Court of First Instance to recover the land conveyed, on the ground (1) that 
the donation being <em>mortis causa</em>, it had been lawfully revoked by the 
donor; and (2) even if it were a donation <em>inter vivos</em>, the same was 
invalidated because (<em>a</em>) it was not properly accepted; (<em>b</em>) 
because the donor did not reserve sufficient property for her own maintenance, 
and (<em>c</em>) because the donee was guilty of ingratitude, for having refused 
to support the donor.</p>
<p>Issues having been joined, and trial had, the Court of First Instance denied 
the recovery sought, and Antonina Cuevas thereupon appealed. The Court of 
Appeals forwarded the case to this Court because, the case having been submitted 
on a stipulation of facts, the appellant raised only questions of law.</p>
<p>The first issue tendered concerns the true nature of the deed "Exhibit A"; 
whether it embodies a donation <em>inter vivos</em>, or a disposition of 
property <em>mortis causa</em> revocable freely by the transferor at any time 
before death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>It has been ruled that neither the designation <em>mortis causa</em>, nor the 
provision that a donation is "to take effect at the death of the donor", is a 
controlling criterion in defining the true nature of donations (Laureta 
<em>vs</em>. Mata, 44 Phil., 668; Concepcion <em>vs</em>. Concepcion, 91 P,hil., 
823), Hence, the crux of the controversy revolves around the following 
provisions of the deed of donation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dapat maalaman ni Crispulo Cuevas m samantalang ako ay nabubuhay, ang lupa 
na ipinagkakaloob ko sa kaniya ay ako pa rin ang patuloy na mamomosecion, 
makapagpapatrabaho, makikinabang at ang iba pang karapatan sa pagmamayari ay sa 
akin pa rin hanggang hindi ko binabawian ng buhay ng Maykapal at ito naman ay 
hindi ko ñga iya-alis pagkat kung ako ay mamatay na ay inilalaan ko sa 
kaniya."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an apparent conflict in the expression above quoted, in that the 
donor reserves to herself "the right of possession, cultivation, harvesting and 
other rights and attributes of ownership while I am not deprived of life by the 
Almighty"; but right after, the same donor states that she "will not take away" 
(the property) "because I reserve it for him (the donee) when, I die." :</p>
<p>The question to be decided 13 whether the donpr intended to part with the 
title to the property immediately upon the execution of the deed, or only later, 
when she had died. If the first, the donation is operative <em>inter vivos</em>; 
if the second, we would be confronted with a disposition <em>mortis causa</em>, 
void from the beginning because the formalities of testaments were not observed 
(new Civil Code, Arts. 728 and 828; heirs of Bonsato <em>vs</em>. Court of 
Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 50 Off. Gaz, (8), p. 3568; 
Tuason <em>vs</em>. Posadas, 54 Phil., 289; Sent. Trib. Sup. of Spain, 8 July 
1943).</p>
<p>We agree with the Court below that the .decisive proof that the present 
donation is operative inter vivos lies in the final phrase to the effect that 
the donor will not dispose or take away ("<em>hindi ko ñga iya-alis</em>" in the 
priginal) the land "because I am reserving it to him upon my death." By these 
words the donor expressly renounced the right to freely dispose of the property 
in. favor of another (a right essential to full ownership) and manifested the 
irrevocability of the conveyance of the naked, title to the property in favor of 
the donee. As stated in our decision in Bonsato <em>vs</em>. Court of Appeals, 
<em>ante</em>, such irrevocability is characteristic of donations <em>inter 
vivos</em>, because it is incompatible with the idea of a disposition <em>post 
mortem</em>. Witness article 828 of the New Civil Code, that provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 828. A will may be revoked by the testator at any time before his 
death. Any waiver or restriction of this right is void."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is apparent from the entire context of the deed of donation that the donor 
intended that she should retain-the entire beneficial ownership during her 
lifetime, but that the naked title should irrevocably pass to the donee. It is 
only thus that all the expressions heretofore discussed can be given full 
effect; and when the donor stated that she would continue to retain the 
"possession, cultivation, harvesting and all other rights and attributes of 
ownership," she meant only the <em>dominium utile</em>, not the full ownership. 
As the Court below correctly observed,. the words "rights and attributes of 
ownership" should be construed <em>ejusdem generis</em> with the preceding 
rights of "possession, cultivation and harvesting" expressly enumerated in the 
deed. Had the donor meant to retain full or absolute ownership she had no need 
to specify possession, cultivation and harvesting, since all these rights are 
embodied in full or absolute ownership; nor would she then have excluded the 
right of free disposition from the "rights and attributes of ownership" that she 
reserved for herself.</p>
<p>Hence, the Court below rightly concluded that the deed Exhibit A was a valid 
donation <em>inter vivos</em>, with reservation of beneficial title during the 
lifetime of the donor. We may add that it is highly desirable that all those who 
are called to prepare or notarize deeds of donation should call the attention of 
the donors to the necessity of clearly specifying whether, notwithstanding the 
donation, they wish to retain the right to control and dispose at will of the 
property before their death, without need of the consent or intervention of the 
beneficiary, since the express reservation of such right would be conclusive 
indication that the liberality is to exist only at the donor's death, and 
therefore, the formalities of testaments should be observed; while, a 
<em>converso</em>, the express waiver of the right of free disposition would 
place the <em>inter vivos</em> character of the donation beyond dispute (Heirs 
of Bonsato <em>vs</em>. Court of Appeals, 50 Off. Gaz. (8), p. 3568).</p>
<p>The argument that there was no sufficient acceptance, because the deed 
"merely recites that (1) the donee has duly read all the contents of this 
donation; (2) that he 'shall fully respect all its terms'; and (3) that 'for the 
act of benevolence' he is expressing his gratitude" but there is no show of 
acceptance (Appellant's brief, p. 7), is without basis. To respect.the terms of 
the donation, and at the same time express gratitude for the donor's 
benevolence, constitutes sufficient acceptance. If the donee did not accept, 
what had he to be grateful about? We are no longer under the formulary system of 
the Roman law, when specific expressions had to be used under pain of 
nullity.</p>
<p>Also unmeritorious is the contention that the donation is void because the 
donor failed to reserve enough for her own support. As we have seen, she 
expressly reserved to herself all the benefits derivable from the donated 
property as long as she lived. During that time, she suffered no diminution of 
income. If that was not enough to support her, the deficiency was not due to the 
donation.</p>
<p>Finally, the donee is not rightfully chargeable with ingratitude, because it 
was expressly stipulated that the donee had a total income of only P30 a month, 
out of which he had to support himself, his wife and his two children. Evidently 
his means did not allow him to add the donor's support to his own burdens.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed. No costs in this instance, 
appellant having obtained leave to litigate as a pauper. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
