				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A..L. Ammen Transportation Co.,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; hereinafter referred&nbsp; to as&nbsp; defendant, is a corporation&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the business of transporting&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; by land&nbsp;&nbsp; for compensation in the Bicol provinces&nbsp; and one&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lines it operates is&nbsp; the one connecting&nbsp; Legaspi City, Albay with Naga City, Camarines Sur.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the buses which defendant was operating is Bus No. 31.&nbsp; <br><br> On May 31, 1951, plaintiff boarded said&nbsp; bus&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; a passenger&nbsp; paying&nbsp; the required fare from Ligao, Albay&nbsp; bound for&nbsp; Pili,&nbsp; Camarines Sur,&nbsp; but&nbsp; before reaching his destination, the&nbsp; bus collided with a&nbsp; motor vehicle of the pick-up type coming from the opposite direction, as a result of which plaintiff's left&nbsp; arm was completely severed and the severed portion fell&nbsp; inside&nbsp; the&nbsp; bus.&nbsp; Plaintiff was rushed&nbsp; to a hospital in Iriga, Camarines Sur where he was given&nbsp; blood transfusion to save his life.&nbsp;&nbsp; After four days, he was transferred to another hospital in&nbsp; Tabaco,&nbsp; Albay, where he.&nbsp; under-went treatment for three months.&nbsp; He was moved later to the&nbsp; Orthopedic Hospital&nbsp;&nbsp; where he&nbsp; was operated on and&nbsp; stayed&nbsp; there&nbsp; for another&nbsp; two months.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; these services, he&nbsp; incurred expenses amounting to P623.40, excluding medical fees which were paid by defendant.<br><br>As an aftermath, plaintiff brought this&nbsp; action against defendant&nbsp; for damages alleging that the collision&nbsp; which resulted&nbsp; in the&nbsp; loss of his left&nbsp; arm&nbsp; was mainly due to the&nbsp; gross&nbsp; incompetence and recklessness&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver of the&nbsp; bus&nbsp; operated&nbsp; by&nbsp; defendant and&nbsp; that defendant incurred in&nbsp;<i> culpa contractual</i> arising from its non-compliance&nbsp; with its obligation&nbsp; to transport&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; safely to his&nbsp; destination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff&nbsp; prays for&nbsp; judgment against defendant&nbsp; as follows:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; P5,000 as&nbsp; expenses for&nbsp; his medical treatment, and P3,000 as the cost of&nbsp; an artificial arm, or a total of P8.000; (2) P6,000 representing loss of earning; (3) P75,000&nbsp; for diminution of his earning capacity;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; P50,000 as moral damages; and&nbsp; (5) P10,000 as attorneys' fees and&nbsp; costs of suit.<br><br>Defendant set up as special&nbsp; defense that the&nbsp; injury suffered&nbsp; by plaintiff&nbsp; was due entirely&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fault or negligence&nbsp; of the driver of the pick-up car which collided with the bus driven by its driver and to the contributory negligence&nbsp; of plaintiff himself.&nbsp; Defendant further&nbsp; claims that the accident which resulted&nbsp; in the injury of plaintiff is one which defendant could not foresee or, though fore-seen, was inevitable.<br><br>The court after trial found&nbsp; that the&nbsp; collision&nbsp; occurred due&nbsp; to the negligence of the .driver&nbsp; of the pick-up&nbsp; car and&nbsp; not to that&nbsp; of the&nbsp; driver of the&nbsp; bus it appearing that the latter did everything he could to avoid the same but&nbsp; that notwithstanding&nbsp; his&nbsp; efforts,&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; able to avoid it. As&nbsp; a consequence,&nbsp; the court dismissed&nbsp; the complaint,&nbsp; with costs against plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an appeal from said decision.<br><br>It&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that plaintiff boarded&nbsp; a&nbsp; bus&nbsp; of defendant as paying&nbsp; passenger&nbsp; from Ligao, Albay, bound&nbsp; for&nbsp; Pili, Camarines Sur,. but before reaching his destination,&nbsp; the bus&nbsp; collided with a&nbsp; pick-up car which was coming from the opposite direction and, as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result,&nbsp; his&nbsp; left arm was completely severed&nbsp; and fell inside the&nbsp; back part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having this background in view, and&nbsp; considering that plaintiff&nbsp; chose&nbsp; to hold defendant liable&nbsp; on its&nbsp; contractual obligation&nbsp; to carry&nbsp; him safely to his&nbsp; place&nbsp; of destination, it becomes important to determine the&nbsp; nature and&nbsp; extent of&nbsp; the liability&nbsp; of a&nbsp; common&nbsp; carrier to&nbsp; a passenger&nbsp; in&nbsp; the light&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; in&nbsp; this jurisdiction.<br><br>In this&nbsp; connection, appellant invokes&nbsp; the&nbsp; rule that, "when&nbsp; an&nbsp; action, is based&nbsp; on&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract&nbsp; of carriage,&nbsp; as in this case, all that is&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; sustain&nbsp; recovery is proof of the existence of the&nbsp; contract and of the&nbsp; breach thereof by act&nbsp; or omission", and in support&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; he cites several Philippine cases.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> With this ruling&nbsp; in mind; appellant seems. to imply that once the contract of carriage&nbsp; is established&nbsp; and there&nbsp; is proof&nbsp; that&nbsp; the same was&nbsp; broken&nbsp; by failure of the carrier&nbsp; to&nbsp; transport&nbsp; the passenger&nbsp; safely&nbsp; to&nbsp; his&nbsp; destination,&nbsp; the liability&nbsp; of&nbsp; the former attaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, appellee claims that that is a wrong&nbsp; presentation of the rule. It claims that the decisions of this Court in the cases cited do not warrant the construction sought to be placed&nbsp; upon them&nbsp; by appellant for a mere perusal thereof would show that the liability of&nbsp; the&nbsp; carrier&nbsp; was predicated&nbsp; not&nbsp; upon mere breach of, its contract of carriage but&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the finding that its negligence was found to be the direct or proximate cause of the injury complained of.&nbsp; Thus, appellee contends that "if there is no&nbsp; negligence on the part of the common carrier but&nbsp; that the accident resulting in injuries is due to causes which are inevitable&nbsp; and which could not have been avoided or&nbsp; anticipated&nbsp; notwithstanding the exercise of that high degree of care&nbsp; and skill&nbsp; which the carrier is bound to exercise&nbsp; for the&nbsp; safety of, his&nbsp; passengers", neither the common carrier nor the driver is liable therefor. We&nbsp; believe that the law&nbsp; concerning the liability of a common carrier has now suffered a substantial modification in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; innovations introduced&nbsp; by the new Civil&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; These innovations&nbsp; are the ones&nbsp; embodied&nbsp; in Articles 1733, 1755 and 1756 in so far as the&nbsp; relation between&nbsp; a common carrier and&nbsp; its passengers is concerned, which,&nbsp; for ready reference, we quote hereunder:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1733. Common carriers, from the nature of their business and for&nbsp; reasons of public&nbsp; policy,&nbsp; are&nbsp; bound&nbsp; to observe&nbsp; extraordinary diligence in&nbsp; the vigilance over the&nbsp; goods&nbsp; and for&nbsp; the safety&nbsp; of&nbsp; the passengers transported by&nbsp; them&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; all the circumstances of each case.<br><br>"Such extraordinary diligence&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; vigilance over the goods is further expressed in articles&nbsp; 1734, 1735, and&nbsp; 1745, Nos. 5, 6, and 7,&nbsp; while the extraordinary&nbsp; diligence&nbsp; for the&nbsp; safety of&nbsp; the passengers is&nbsp; further set forth in&nbsp; articles 1755 and 1756."<br><br>"ART. 1755. A common carrier&nbsp; is bound to carry the passengers safely&nbsp; as&nbsp; far as&nbsp; human care and foresight can provide, using the utmost diligence of very cautious&nbsp; persons, with&nbsp; a due regard for all&nbsp; the circumstances."<br><br>"ART. 1756.&nbsp; In case of death of or injuries to passengers, common carriers are&nbsp; presumed to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; at fault or to have acted negligently, unless&nbsp; they&nbsp; prove&nbsp; that they&nbsp; observed&nbsp; extraordinary diligence as prescribed in articles 1733 and 1755."<br></blockquote>The Code Commission, in justifying this extraordinary diligence required of a common carrier, says the following:<br><blockquote> "A&nbsp; common&nbsp; carrier&nbsp; is&nbsp; bound to carry the passengers&nbsp; safely as far as human care and foresight can provide, using- the utmost diligence&nbsp; of very cautious persons, with due&nbsp; regard for all&nbsp; circumstances.&nbsp; This&nbsp; extraordinary&nbsp; diligence&nbsp; required&nbsp; of&nbsp; common carriers&nbsp; is&nbsp; calculated to protect the&nbsp; passengers from the&nbsp; tragic mishaps&nbsp; that&nbsp; frequently occur&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with rapid modern transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This high standard&nbsp; of care is imperatively&nbsp; demanded by the preciousness of human life and fcy the&nbsp; consideration that every person must in every&nbsp; way be safeguarded against all injury.&nbsp; (Report&nbsp; of the Code Commission, pp. 35-30)"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Padilla, Civil Code of the Philippines, Vol. IV, 1953 ed., p. 197). </blockquote>From the&nbsp; above&nbsp; legal provisions,&nbsp; we&nbsp; can&nbsp; make&nbsp; the following&nbsp; restatement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the principles&nbsp; governing&nbsp; the liability&nbsp; of a common carrier: (1) the liability of a carrier is contractual and arises upon breach of&nbsp; its obligation. There is breach if it&nbsp; fails to exert extraordinary diligence according to&nbsp; all&nbsp; the circumstances of&nbsp; each case;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; a carrier is obliged to carry its passenger with the utmost diligence of&nbsp; a very&nbsp; cautious person, having&nbsp; due regard for all&nbsp; the circumstances;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; a carrier is presumed to be&nbsp; at fault or to have" acted negligently in case of&nbsp; death of, or injury to,&nbsp; passengers, it&nbsp; being its duty&nbsp; to prove that&nbsp; it&nbsp; exercised&nbsp; extraordinary diligence; and&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; the carrier&nbsp; is not an&nbsp; insurer&nbsp; against&nbsp; all risks of travel.<br><br>The question that now&nbsp; arises is: Has&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; observed extraordinary diligence or the utmost diligence of<br><br>every cautious person,&nbsp; having due regard for&nbsp; all&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; in&nbsp; avoiding the collision&nbsp; which resulted in&nbsp; the injury caused to the plaintiff?<br><br>After&nbsp; examining the evidence in connection with&nbsp; how the collision occurred, the lower court made the following finding:<br><blockquote>"Hemos examinado muy detenidamente las pruehas presentadas en&nbsp; la vista,&nbsp; prineipalmente,&nbsp; las&nbsp; declaraciones&nbsp; que hemos aeotado arriba, y hemos llegado a la conclusion de&nbsp; que&nbsp; el demandado ha hecbo, todo cuanto estuviere de su parte para evitar el&nbsp; accidente, pcro sin embargo, no lia podido evitarlo.<br><br>"El hecho de&nbsp; que&nbsp; el deraandado, antes&nbsp; del choquc,&nbsp; tuvo que hacer pasar su&nbsp; truck&nbsp; encima&nbsp; do&nbsp; los&nbsp; montones&nbsp; de grava que estaban&nbsp; depositados&nbsp; en&nbsp; la&nbsp; orilla del earaino,&nbsp; sin&nbsp; que&nbsp; haya&nbsp; ido mas alia, por ol&nbsp; grave riesgo que&nbsp; corrian&nbsp; las vidas&nbsp; de&nbsp; sus pasajeros, es prueba&nbsp; concluyente&nbsp; do lo que tenemos dicho a saber:— que&nbsp; el demandado hizo&nbsp; cuanto estaba de&nbsp; su parte, para&nbsp; evitar el&nbsp; aceidente, sin&nbsp; que haya&nbsp; podido evitarlo, por&nbsp; estar&nbsp; fuera de su control."<br></blockquote>The evidence would appear to support the&nbsp; above finding.&nbsp; Thus, it appears that Bus No. 31, immediately prior to&nbsp; the&nbsp; collision, was&nbsp; running&nbsp; at a&nbsp; moderate speed because it had just stopped at the school zone of Matacong, Polangui, Albay.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pick-up car was at full speed and was running outside of its proper lane.&nbsp; The driver of the&nbsp; bus,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; seeing&nbsp; the manner&nbsp; in which the pick-up was then running, swerved the&nbsp; bus to the very&nbsp; extreme right of&nbsp; the&nbsp; road&nbsp; until its&nbsp; front and rear wheels have gone over the&nbsp; pile of&nbsp; stones&nbsp; or gravel&nbsp; situated on the rampart&nbsp; of&nbsp; the road.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; driver could&nbsp; not move the bus farther right and run over&nbsp; a greater portion of the pile, the&nbsp; peak&nbsp; of which was about 3 feet&nbsp; high,&nbsp; without endangering the safety of his passengers.&nbsp; And notwithstanding&nbsp; all these&nbsp; efforts, the rear&nbsp; left side&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bus was hit by the&nbsp; pick-up car.<br><br>Of course,&nbsp; this&nbsp; finding is disputed by appellant who cannot see eye&nbsp; to&nbsp; eye with the evidence for&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee and insists&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; collision&nbsp; took&nbsp;&nbsp; place because the driver of&nbsp; the bus was going at a fast&nbsp; speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He contends that, having seen that a car was coming from the&nbsp; opposite direction&nbsp; at a distance&nbsp; which allows the use&nbsp; of moderate care and prudence to&nbsp; avoid an&nbsp; accident,&nbsp; and&nbsp; knowing that on the&nbsp; side of the road along which&nbsp; he was&nbsp; going there was a pile of gravel, the driver of the&nbsp; bus should have stopped and waited for the vehicle from&nbsp; the&nbsp; opposite direction&nbsp; to&nbsp; pass,&nbsp; and should&nbsp; have proceeded only&nbsp; after the other vehicle had passed.&nbsp; In other words, according to appellant, the act of the driver of the bus in squeezing his way through between&nbsp; the&nbsp; oncoming- pick-up and the pile of gravel under the circumstances was considered negligent.<br><br>But this matter is one of credibility and evaluation of the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; the function of&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court. The trial&nbsp; court ha3 already&nbsp; spoken&nbsp; on&nbsp; this matter&nbsp; as we&nbsp; have&nbsp; pointed out above.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp; also&nbsp; a matter&nbsp; of appreciation of the&nbsp; situation&nbsp; on the part of the driver. While the position&nbsp; taken by appellant appeals&nbsp; more&nbsp; to the sense of caution that one&nbsp; should observe in&nbsp; a&nbsp; given situation to avoid an accident or&nbsp; mishap, such&nbsp; however can not always be expected from one who is placed suddenly&nbsp; in&nbsp; a predicament&nbsp; where he&nbsp; is&nbsp; not given enough time&nbsp; to take the proper course of action as he should under ordinary circumstances.&nbsp; One who is placed in such a predicament&nbsp; cannot exercise such coolness or&nbsp; accuracy of judgment as is&nbsp; required&nbsp; of him under ordinary&nbsp; circumstances and he cannot therefore be expected to observe the same&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; care&nbsp; and&nbsp; precaution&nbsp; as in the latter.<br><br>For&nbsp; this&nbsp; reason,&nbsp; authorities&nbsp;&nbsp; abound&nbsp; where&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to observe the same degree of care that as ordinary prudent man would exercise under ordinary circumstances&nbsp; when confronted with a sudden emergency was held to be warranted&nbsp; and a&nbsp; justification to exempt&nbsp; the carrier&nbsp; from liability.&nbsp; Thus, it&nbsp; was&nbsp; held that&nbsp; "where&nbsp; a.&nbsp; carrier's employee&nbsp; is confronted with&nbsp; a sudden&nbsp; emergency,&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; obliged&nbsp; to&nbsp; act quickly&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; without&nbsp; a chance for&nbsp; deliberation must&nbsp; be taken into&nbsp; account, and he is not' held&nbsp; to the same degree&nbsp; of&nbsp; care that he would otherwise be required to&nbsp; exercise in the&nbsp; absence of&nbsp; such emergency but must exercise only such&nbsp; care as&nbsp; any ordinary&nbsp; prudent&nbsp; person&nbsp; would&nbsp; exercise&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp; like circumstances and conditions,&nbsp; and the failure on his part to exercise the&nbsp; best&nbsp; judgment the&nbsp; case&nbsp; renders&nbsp; possible does not establish lack of care and skill on his part which renders the company, liable. * * *."&nbsp;&nbsp; (13 C. J. S.,&nbsp; 1412; 10 C. J., 970).&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering all the circumstances, we are persuaded to&nbsp; conclude&nbsp; that the&nbsp; driver of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bus&nbsp; has done what a prudent man&nbsp; could&nbsp; have&nbsp; done to avoid the collision and in&nbsp; our opinion&nbsp; this relieves&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; from liability under&nbsp; our law.<br><br>A circumstance&nbsp; which&nbsp; militates against the&nbsp; stand of appellant is&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; borne out by the evidence that&nbsp; when he&nbsp; boarded&nbsp; the&nbsp; bus in question, he&nbsp; seated&nbsp; himself&nbsp; on the left side thereof resting his left arm on the window sill&nbsp; but with&nbsp; his&nbsp; left&nbsp; elbow outside&nbsp; the&nbsp; window,&nbsp; this being his position in&nbsp; the bus when the collision took&nbsp; place. It is for&nbsp; this&nbsp; reason that the collision&nbsp; resulted in&nbsp; the severance&nbsp; of said&nbsp; left&nbsp; arm from the&nbsp; body of&nbsp; appellant thus doing him a great&nbsp; damage. It is therefore apparent that appellant&nbsp; is guilty of contributory negligence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had he&nbsp; not placed&nbsp; his left&nbsp; arm on the window&nbsp; sill with&nbsp; a portion&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; protruding outside, perhaps&nbsp; the injury would have&nbsp; been avoided as&nbsp; is the case with the&nbsp; other passengers.&nbsp; It is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; noted that appellant was&nbsp; the only victim of&nbsp; the collision.<br><br>It is true that such contributory&nbsp; negligence cannot relieve appellee of&nbsp; its liability&nbsp; but will&nbsp; only&nbsp; entitle&nbsp; it&nbsp; to&nbsp; a reduction of the amount&nbsp; of damage caused&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 1762, new Civil&nbsp; Code), but this&nbsp; is a circumstance which further militates&nbsp; against the position&nbsp; taken by appellant in this case. <br><blockquote>"It is the&nbsp; prevailing rule&nbsp; that&nbsp; it is negligence&nbsp; per&nbsp; se&nbsp; for&nbsp; a passenger on&nbsp; a railroad voluntarily or inadvertently to protrude his&nbsp; arm, hand,&nbsp; elbow,&nbsp; or&nbsp; any other,&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; body through the&nbsp; window of a&nbsp; moving car beyond the outer edge of the window or outer surface&nbsp; of the&nbsp; ear, so&nbsp; as to come in contact with object? or obstacles near the track,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that no&nbsp; recovery can be had for&nbsp; an&nbsp; injury which&nbsp; but&nbsp; for&nbsp; such negligence would&nbsp; not have been sustained. * * *"&nbsp; (10 C. J. 1139)<br><br>"Plaintiff, (passenger) while riding&nbsp; on&nbsp; an interurban car, to flick the ashes&nbsp; from&nbsp; his cigar, thrust his&nbsp; hand&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp; guard rail a sufficient&nbsp; distance beyond the side line of the car to&nbsp; bring" it in contact with the trunk of a tree standing beside&nbsp; the&nbsp; track; the&nbsp; force&nbsp; of&nbsp; the blow breaking&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; wrist. <i>Held,</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law."&nbsp; (Malakia<i> vs.</i> Khode, Island Co., 89 A., 837.)</blockquote>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengson, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Felix,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> Cangeo contra Manila Railroad Co., 38 Jur.
