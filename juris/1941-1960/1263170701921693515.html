				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is&nbsp; a petition for&nbsp; review of&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals rendered&nbsp; on October&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1956, as well as&nbsp; its resolution&nbsp; entered on&nbsp; October 30, 1956, denying the motion for&nbsp;&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; filed by&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; the modification of said decision.&nbsp; The decision adverted to contain&nbsp; an&nbsp; injunction restraining the&nbsp;&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; of iloilo from proceeding with the investigation of a criminal complaint filed&nbsp; by Jose&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Zulueta against respondents Mariano B. Peñaflorida&nbsp; and Ricardo Y. Ladrido.<br><br>Zulueta and Peñaflorida&nbsp; were candidates for the position of Provincial Governor of Iloilo in the elections held on&nbsp; November 8, 1955.&nbsp; Penaflorida&nbsp; was declared elected by the Board of Canvassers with a plurality of 4,687 votes on&nbsp; November 25, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zulueta filed&nbsp; with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo a protest contesting the election of Peñaflorida on the grounds of errors, irregularities, frauds and corrupt practices.&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 6,&nbsp; 1956, Ceferino de los&nbsp; Santos, Jr.,&nbsp; a defeated candidate for board member, filed a criminal complaint in said court against Peñaflorida and Ladrido charging the latter with a violation of Section 49 of the Revised Election&nbsp; Code relative to corrupt practices.&nbsp; This complaint was&nbsp; dismissed on the ground that, the violation charged being a public&nbsp; offense, the same can only be prosecuted by a government prosecutor and not by&nbsp; a private individual.&nbsp;&nbsp; And taking cue of this suggestion, Zulueta lodged a complaint with the fiscal involving the same&nbsp; charged against Peñaflorida&nbsp; and Ladrido.<br><br>The fiscal set&nbsp; the complaint for investigation on February&nbsp; 14, 1956&nbsp; at which the complainant presented his evidence, but&nbsp; after the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was presented,&nbsp; Peñaflorida and Ladrido,&nbsp; through . their&nbsp; counsel, asked for&nbsp; the&nbsp; suspension&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that, the violation being one of the grounds on&nbsp; which the election protest then pending&nbsp; in&nbsp; court is based, the same constitutes a prejudicial question which must first be decided before the criminal complaint could&nbsp; be&nbsp; given&nbsp; due course. This&nbsp; motion having been denied on the ground&nbsp; that the point raised does not constitute&nbsp; a&nbsp; prejudicial question, Peñaflorida&nbsp; and Ladrido, through&nbsp; counsel, filed a petition for-prohibition&nbsp; with&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; on&nbsp; April&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1956 with the Court of First Instance of Iloilo&nbsp; praying that the provincial fiscal&nbsp; be&nbsp; enjoined from proceeding with the&nbsp; investigation of the criminal case until after the election contest shall have been finally determined, and on April&nbsp; 20, the court issued&nbsp; a preliminary injunction after petitioner had filed a bond&nbsp; in the amount of P1,000.&nbsp; In the prohibition case, the court allowed Attys. Ceferino de Ios&nbsp; Santos, Sr., Ceferino de Ios Santos, Jr. and Vicente Custodio to appear as <i>amici curia</i>e in its&nbsp; order entered on July 6, 1956.<br><br>In the&nbsp; meantime, Zulueta&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in the&nbsp; election&nbsp; protest an amended&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was further amended later, seeking to strike out&nbsp; from the original protest the averment relative to&nbsp; corrupt practices which&nbsp; are&nbsp; involved in the&nbsp; criminal case then under investigation by the fiscal, which was strongly resisted by Peñaflorida.&nbsp; But, over his&nbsp; opposition, the&nbsp; court admitted the amended&nbsp; petition on July 6, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peñaflorida on his part asked leave to file an amended answer containing&nbsp; a counterclaim wherein he not only&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the imputation made&nbsp; against&nbsp; him in the&nbsp; original protest&nbsp; concerning corrupt&nbsp; practices&nbsp; committed by him and&nbsp; his henchmen,&nbsp; but prayed: for moral damages and attorney's fees in&nbsp; the aggregate&nbsp; amount of P150,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion was denied on&nbsp; April 24, 1956, whereupon Peñaflorida and Ladrido brought the&nbsp; case by way of certiorari to the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals wherein they sought to set aside the following orders: one dated July 6, 1956 admitting the&nbsp; amended petition of&nbsp; protestant; one dated April 24, 1956 denying the admission of protestee's amended answer, and&nbsp; another dated July 6, 1956 granting leave to Attys. Ceferino de Ios Santos, Sr., Ceferino de Ios Santos, Jr. and Vicente Custodio to appear as amid euriae in the certiorari ease.&nbsp; On&nbsp; October 12,&nbsp; 1956, the Court of Appeals&nbsp; denied the petition&nbsp; but&nbsp; enjoined forever the fiscal from proceeding with the investigation of the criminal&nbsp; complaint filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Zulueta&nbsp; against&nbsp; Peñaflorida&nbsp; and Ladrido.<br><br>The question to be determined in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeals erred in enjoining the provincial fiscal from proceeding with the&nbsp; investigation of the criminal charge filed&nbsp; by Zulueta against Peñaflorida and&nbsp; Ladrido&nbsp; on&nbsp; the sole&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that, the&nbsp; charge involving as&nbsp; it&nbsp; does a disqualification to hold&nbsp; office, the same&nbsp; is tantamount to&nbsp; a petition for <i>quo&nbsp; warranto</i> which can only be&nbsp; filed within one week from the proclamation of the one declared elected.&nbsp; Since the criminal complaint was lodged with the fiscal&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; lapse of one week&nbsp; from proclamation, the Court of Appeals expressed the view that Peñaflorida can no longer be&nbsp; prosecuted for the offense and so&nbsp; the fiscal should be perpetually enjoined.<br><br>The <i>ratio&nbsp; decidendi</i>&nbsp; on which the foregoing&nbsp; conclusion of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals, is predicated&nbsp; is contained&nbsp; in the following portion of its&nbsp; decaion:<br><blockquote>"* * * The purpose,&nbsp; therefore, of the&nbsp; protestant in filing&nbsp; a&nbsp; criminal complaint against Peñaflorida and Ladrido for&nbsp; the alleged violation of&nbsp; Sec. 49 is&nbsp; to have&nbsp; them imprisoned and disqualified to hold office&nbsp; to which&nbsp; they have been elected.&nbsp; If Sec.&nbsp; 173 prohibits the filing of a petition for <i>quo&nbsp; warranto</i> for the purpose of disqualifying the respondent after the lapse&nbsp; of one week&nbsp; from the time of the proclamation of petitioner&nbsp; Peñaflorida, the same purpose cannot be accomplished after the lapse of one week&nbsp; from the time of his proclamation by the filing of a criminal complaint and hence the protestant and respondent herein Zulueta and the fiscal should&nbsp; he&nbsp; enjoined forever from proceeding with the investigation of the criminal complaint filed by the former and&nbsp; the filing thereof&nbsp; by the latter."</blockquote>The&nbsp; theory of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; would&nbsp; appear to be as follows: the action of <i>quo warranto</i> allowed by Section 173 of the&nbsp; Revised Election Code has&nbsp; for its purpose the disqualification of the winning candidate.&nbsp; A criminal action&nbsp; for&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 49&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same Code&nbsp; on corrupt practices aims likewise&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; disqualification of the winning candidate which may&nbsp; be&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; upon&nbsp; him as a punishment.&nbsp; Since both actions have&nbsp; the same&nbsp; purpose, both must be&nbsp; governed by the same&nbsp; rule prescribed by Section&nbsp; 173&nbsp; which requires that the&nbsp; action be&nbsp; filed within&nbsp; one week from proclamation of the winning&nbsp; candidate.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the criminal action is taken&nbsp; beyond that period, its prosecution&nbsp; against the candidate should be&nbsp; forever barred.<br><br>We find this reasoning erroneous.&nbsp;&nbsp; To begin with, one should not confuse an&nbsp; action of <i>quo&nbsp; warranto</i> with the complaint&nbsp; for a violation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Election Code even if the same may have&nbsp; the effect of&nbsp; disqualifying a&nbsp; candidate to hold the&nbsp; office to&nbsp; which he&nbsp; is elected.&nbsp;&nbsp; One&nbsp; partakes of the nature of&nbsp; a civil case wherein the petitioner is the defeated candidate, while&nbsp; the other is a&nbsp; criminal action which is prosecuted in the name&nbsp; of the People.&nbsp; Both proceedings have different objectives and are predicated on different grounds. The purpose&nbsp; of <i>quo warranto</i> is merely to prevent an elective official from assuming office on the ground&nbsp; of&nbsp; ineligibility.&nbsp; To be eligible, one must&nbsp; have the qualifications&nbsp; required by law with&nbsp; regard to citizenship, residence,&nbsp; age,&nbsp;&nbsp; loyalty,&nbsp; etc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; On&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, the principal purpose of&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal action is&nbsp; the imprisonment of the&nbsp; offender, be he&nbsp; a candidate or&nbsp; not,&nbsp; and the grounds of the action vary depending upon&nbsp; the acts committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the acts involved are those&nbsp; prohibited by Section 49 of the Election Cade relative to&nbsp; corrupt&nbsp; practices.&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; present offense&nbsp; carries&nbsp; with it the accessory penalty of disqualification from holding office does not convert it into an action of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>.&nbsp; Lastly, there is a&nbsp; difference as regards&nbsp; the&nbsp; prescriptibility of the action.&nbsp; While an action of <i>quo warranto</i> should be filed within&nbsp; one week from proclamation,&nbsp; an&nbsp; election offense prescribes after two years, from the date&nbsp; of its commission, and if the discovery is made on&nbsp; the occasion of&nbsp; an election contest, the period shall commence on the date the&nbsp; judgment becomes final (Section&nbsp; 188, Revised&nbsp; Election Code). Indeed, this provision would&nbsp; be rendered nugatory if the theory of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals&nbsp; is entertained.<br><br>Another&nbsp; point to be&nbsp; considered is that,&nbsp; "as a&nbsp; general rule,&nbsp; an&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; will&nbsp; not&nbsp; be granted&nbsp; to&nbsp; restrain&nbsp; a criminal&nbsp; prosecution"&nbsp; (Kwong Sing&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; City of&nbsp; Manila, 41&nbsp; Phil., 1.03).&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason&nbsp; is&nbsp; obvious,&nbsp;&nbsp; Public&nbsp; interest requires&nbsp; that&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; acts&nbsp; be&nbsp; immediately&nbsp; investigated and prosecuted for the protection of society.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is more so&nbsp; in connection&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Election Law. The only way to curb fraud,&nbsp; terrorism and other&nbsp; corrupt practices that are committed in the&nbsp; elections is to&nbsp; demand their immediate&nbsp; investigation and&nbsp; prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only&nbsp; in this way can we maintain a clean election and secure the free&nbsp; expression&nbsp; of the people's will&nbsp; at the&nbsp; polls.<br><blockquote>"The general&nbsp; rule,&nbsp; sometimes by virtue&nbsp; of statutory provisions, is that an injunction will not be granted&nbsp; to&nbsp; stay criminal&nbsp; or quasi criminal proceedings,&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; prosecution is for the&nbsp; violation of the common law or the infraction of&nbsp; statutes&nbsp; or&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; ordinances,&nbsp; or&nbsp; to stay the enforcement of orders of&nbsp; a&nbsp; board or commission.&nbsp; This general rule&nbsp; is based, in addition to other considerations, on&nbsp; the principle that equity&nbsp; is&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; only&nbsp; with the protection of&nbsp; civil&nbsp; and property rights, and is intended to supplement, and not usurp, the functions of the courts of law, and on the fact that the party has an adequate remedy&nbsp; at&nbsp; law by establishing as a defense to&nbsp; the prosecution that he did not commit the act charged, or that the statute&nbsp; or ordinance on which the prosecution is&nbsp; based is invalid, and,&nbsp; in case of conviction,&nbsp; by&nbsp; taking an&nbsp; appeal."&nbsp; (43 C. J. S.,&nbsp; pp. 768-770).</blockquote>It&nbsp; is contended&nbsp; that this rule admits of exceptions, one. of them being that "injunctions may be issued to restrain vexatious and oppressive&nbsp; criminal prosecutions" (Yellowstone Kit vs. Wood, 43&nbsp; S. W. 1068,&nbsp; 19 Tex. C. App. 683). This may be true, but&nbsp; we are not&nbsp; prepared&nbsp; to hold that Zulueta&nbsp; filed the criminaf. charge with&nbsp; the intent to harass and oppress respondents,&nbsp; there being no&nbsp; clear findings to that&nbsp; effect by the Court of&nbsp; Appeals.&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; remains that the injunction is predicated not on that ground but on another&nbsp; which we&nbsp; have found to be legally untenable.<br><br>The counter assignment of&nbsp; errors made by&nbsp; respondents-appellees in their brief,&nbsp; which seeks&nbsp; to set aside the orders of&nbsp; the court&nbsp; a quo which were&nbsp; maintained by the Court of Appeals, cannot&nbsp; be entertained it appearing&nbsp; that respondents-appellees did not appeal from the decision.<br><blockquote>"* * * While an&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; may&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal be permitted to&nbsp; make counter assignment of errors when the purpose is merely to defend himself against the errors imputed by appellant to the court a quo, such is allowed merely <i>to sustain the judgment in his favor</i> but not to seek a modification or reversal of&nbsp; said judgment, for&nbsp; in such a case there&nbsp; is need for&nbsp; him&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal from&nbsp; the judgment.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is what we&nbsp; said in a recent case.&nbsp; For us to change the <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the&nbsp; decision to suit the theory of respondents would be to infringe this&nbsp; ruling', and this are not&nbsp; prepared to do."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pineda&nbsp; &amp; Ampil Manufacturing Co.,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al. vs.&nbsp; Arsenio Bartolome, et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; 95&nbsp; Phil., 980).<br><br>"Appellee, who&nbsp; is not appellant, may assign errors in&nbsp; his brief where&nbsp; his&nbsp; purpose is to&nbsp; maintain the judgment&nbsp; on other grounds, but he may not do so if his purpose is to have the&nbsp; judgment modified or reversed, for, in such case, he must appeal.&nbsp; (Saenz vs. Mitchell, 60 Phil., 69, 80; Mendoza vs. Mendiola, 63 Phil.,&nbsp; 267; Villavert vs. Lim, 62 Phil., 178; Balajadia vs. Eusala, G. R. No. 42579.)'&nbsp; (Bunge Corporation and Universal&nbsp; Agencies&nbsp; vs. Elena Camenforte &amp; Co., 91 Phil,&nbsp; 861, 48 Off. Gaz., p. S377.)"</blockquote>Wherefore, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is) hereby modi- fied by deleting&nbsp; from&nbsp; its dispositive part that portion which enjoins the provincial fiscal from proceeding with the investigation of the criminal complaint filed by Zulueta against respondents&nbsp; Penaflorida&nbsp; and&nbsp; Ladrido.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
