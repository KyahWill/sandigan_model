				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case presents the following question: When a judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the trial court&nbsp; absolving the&nbsp; defendant from the complaint without special pronouncement as to costs is reversed by the Court of&nbsp; Appeals, which renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff-appellant "with costs against the appellee," do the costs so awarded include those in the Court of First Instance?<br><br>The facts are briefly as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The plaintiff&nbsp; sued the defendant in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Cavite to recover the possession of a portion of land.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court ordered the government surveyor to make a resurvey of the lot in question with&nbsp; the understanding that "any expense which said surveyor might&nbsp; incur to comply with said order&nbsp; shall be advanced&nbsp; by the&nbsp; plaintiff and once the case is finally decided the same shall be taxed as costs&nbsp; which shall be paid by the&nbsp; losing party."&nbsp; Thereafter&nbsp; the court decided the case by absolving the defendant from&nbsp; the complaint without any pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs. The plaintiff appealed to&nbsp; the Court of Appeals, where he prevailed and obtained a&nbsp; reversal of&nbsp; the judgment of the trial court, "with costs against the appellee."<br></blockquote><br>The clerk of the Court of Appeals taxed the costs in&nbsp; that court at P84.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the return of the record to the trial court the plaintiff filed a bill of costs corresponding to the Court of First Instance and to the Court of Appeals aggregating P314.77.&nbsp; The defendant objected thereto&nbsp; and the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Cavite taxed the costs at P224.96,&nbsp; which included&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs of P84 in the Court of Appeals&nbsp; and the sum of P90 which the plaintiff had&nbsp; advanced as&nbsp; expenses for&nbsp; the resurvey of the land.&nbsp; The defendant appealed to&nbsp; the court,&nbsp; which sustained the taxation made by&nbsp; the clerk of court.&nbsp; From that order of the court the defendant appealed to&nbsp; this Court,&nbsp; contending that the costs awarded by&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals referred only to the costs&nbsp; in that court.<br><br>Section 1 of rule 131 (formerly section 487&nbsp; of Act No. 190)&nbsp; provides as&nbsp; follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 1.<i> Costs ordinarily follow results of suit</i>,â€”Unless otherwise provided in these rules, costs shall be allowed to the prevailing partir as a matter of course, but the court shall have power, for special reasons,&nbsp; to adjudge that either party shall pay the costs of&nbsp; an action, or that the same be divided, as may be equitable.&nbsp; No costs shall be allowed against the Commonwealth&nbsp; of the Philippines unless otherwise provided by law."<br></blockquote><br>Since the plaintiff was the party that finally prevailed, he was entitled to the costs as&nbsp; a matter of course, unless the court for special reasons adjudged otherwise.&nbsp; In the instant case, the Court of Appeals not only did not adjudge otherwise but expressly awarded the costs to the plaintiff. "Where *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; the prevailing party is entitled to costs as a matter of course,&nbsp; the&nbsp; words 'with costs' in an order of reversal or affirmance in the court of appeals will be construed&nbsp; to&nbsp; mean all costs made&nbsp; in both the&nbsp; appellate court and&nbsp; the court below&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; "(15 C. J. 260; 20 C. J. S. 590).&nbsp; In the&nbsp; absence, therefore, of any qualification,&nbsp; the costs awarded by the Court of Appeals in the instant case should&nbsp; be construed to mean the costs of suit from its commencement to its termination.<br><br>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abad Santos, Diaz, Moran, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ.,</span> concur. </div>
