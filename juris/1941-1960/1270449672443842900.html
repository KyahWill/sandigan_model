				G.R. No. L-2720, December 31, 1949</h4>
				<H3>HEMANDAS UDHARAM, PETITIONER, VS. RAFAEL DINGLASAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari arising from a case for illegal detainer 
filed by respondents Ysabel Vda. de Padilla and others against petitioner 
Hemandas Udharam in the Municipal Court of Manila. Judgment was rendered in said 
case against petitioner and his codefendants ordering them to vacate the 
premises and pay rents. A supersedeas bond of P1,000 was filed by petitioner 
which was found insufficient by the court and withdrawn later by said 
petitioner. Consequently, the defendants were ejected from the premises except 
petitioner who remained thereon till July 11, 1946. Defendants failed to appeal 
except petitioner against whom in the Court of First Instance a judgment was 
rendered ordering him to pay jointly and severally with his codefendants the sum 
of P3,000 a month from May 1 to July 11, 1946, and to pay costs. Udharam 
appealed to the Court of Appeals but in the meantime a writ of execution was 
issued against him unless a supersedeas bond of P8,000 be given by him, which he 
did not.
<p>The writ of execution is valid. In forcible entry or illegal detainer cases, 
where, as in the instant case, no sufficient supersedeas bond has been given to 
stay execution of the judgment rendered against the defendants, such judgment 
may be executed not only with respect to possession of the property but also as 
to payment of rents.</p>
<p>Petition is denied with costs against petitioner.</p> <em>Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes,</em> and <em>Torres, 
JJ.</em>, concur.<br><em>Paras, J.</em>, concurs in the result.</div>
