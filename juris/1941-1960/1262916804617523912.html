				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In three amended complaints filed in the above-entitled cases in the Municipal&nbsp; Court of Manila,&nbsp; Generoso&nbsp; Amosco accuses&nbsp; Paz Villavicencio,&nbsp; Consuelo&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Garcia, and&nbsp; <i>alias</i> Doe <i>alias</i> Miss Santiago, of slander for uttering insulting words and expressions against him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The slanderous words are alleged to&nbsp; have been uttered&nbsp; on January 23, 1954, and separate informations against the accused had previously been filed by the&nbsp; Fiscal on&nbsp; February 18, 1954.&nbsp; But&nbsp; on Jill}' 21, 1954, the three accused filed a joint motion to quash the informations on the ground that the facts alleged do not constitute an offense,&nbsp; and that the municipal court has no jurisdiction to try the cases.&nbsp; The court sustained this&nbsp; motion on August 11, 1954; so on&nbsp; August 20, 1954, the amended complaints were "filed by the offended&nbsp; party" against the three accused.<br><br>On September&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1954, counsel for&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; again filed a motion to&nbsp; quash the amended complaints on the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense charged&nbsp; therein&nbsp; has been extinguished&nbsp; 03' prescription, and that the facts alleged&nbsp; do not constitute an offense.&nbsp; On&nbsp; October&nbsp; 18, 1954, the Municipal Court&nbsp; dismissed the three cases,&nbsp; but&nbsp; recommended that the Fiscal appeal&nbsp; the order to the higher&nbsp; court so that a clear and&nbsp; definite report&nbsp; on the. matter at&nbsp; issue can&nbsp; be had.&nbsp; The clerk of&nbsp; court entered&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of dismissal in the clerk's daily report of&nbsp; October 18, 1-954. Almost&nbsp; eleven&nbsp; months elapsed&nbsp; without any action on the part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; Being taken, but on September 14, 1955, he filed&nbsp; his notice of&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; against&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of October&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; The papers&nbsp; were forwarded to the Court of First Instance of Manila on September 15, 1955. On September 19,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; counsel for the accused filed&nbsp; a motion in the&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court to dismiss the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; of the prosecution, but&nbsp; the court&nbsp; denied the&nbsp; motion in its order of September 28, &nbsp;<br><br>Once&nbsp; the case was docketed in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; by virtue of&nbsp; the appeal, the accused sought the return&nbsp; of the&nbsp; papers to the Municipal Court&nbsp; in order that his motion for reconsideration of the&nbsp; order allowing the appeal&nbsp; may be passed upon by that court,&nbsp; He also&nbsp; asked that the appeal be elevated directly to the Supreme Court. The&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; denied the motion of the accused that the case be certified to the Supreme&nbsp; Court, holding that the&nbsp; Judiciary Act of&nbsp; 1948&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 296) confers upon the Courts of First Instance the exclusive appellate jurisdiction over&nbsp; all cases "arising from municipal and&nbsp; justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; courts.&nbsp; However, it held, that the&nbsp; order of the&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; dismissing the&nbsp; informations in the&nbsp; three&nbsp; cases may not be reviewed by "it&nbsp; for the reason that the appeal was not perfected "before six o'clock postmeridian&nbsp; of the day after&nbsp; the rendition&nbsp; and entry of the judgment by&nbsp; the municipal court."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section&nbsp; 46,&nbsp; Republic. Act No.&nbsp; 409).&nbsp; Against this order&nbsp; the&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; prosecuted this appeal.<br><br>The&nbsp; issue raised on this appeal&nbsp; is whether or not&nbsp; the period for filing an appeal from a judgment of the municipal court&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; should&nbsp; begin to&nbsp; run <i>from the entry&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment in the said&nbsp; court, or from the receipt of notice of&nbsp; the judgment by the party desiring&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue&nbsp; involves&nbsp; the&nbsp; interpretation of section 46 of Republic Act No. 409,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 46. <i>Procedure&nbsp; on appeal from,&nbsp; municipal court&nbsp; to&nbsp; Court of First Instance</i>.â€”An appeal shall&nbsp; lie to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance next to be held within the&nbsp; city,&nbsp; in all cases where&nbsp; fine or imprisonment,&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; both," is&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; by the municipal&nbsp; court. The party desiring' to appeal shall before&nbsp; six&nbsp; o'clock postmeridian of the day after&nbsp; the&nbsp; rendition and&nbsp; entry of the judgment by the&nbsp; municipal court,&nbsp; file with&nbsp; the clerk of the&nbsp; court a written statement that&nbsp; he appeals&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance.&nbsp; The filing of such statement shall perfect the&nbsp; appeals. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.</blockquote>The above provision is&nbsp; a&nbsp; reproduction&nbsp; of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 2445 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1916, and&nbsp; therefore it&nbsp; should be interpreted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the same manner as the latter.<br><br>Some members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; sustain the view that a judgment or order of the municipal court may be appealed by the Fiscal within the period provided, to be computed from the&nbsp; actual receipt of the notice of the judgment or order.&nbsp; The reason for&nbsp; this&nbsp; view is that&nbsp; this has&nbsp; been the practice and procedure followed in&nbsp; all courts and in all proceedings, and lack of notice may be deemed a denial of due process.&nbsp; Others&nbsp; are of the opinion, following the ruling of&nbsp; the judge below,&nbsp; that the entry of the judgment or order in the records of the municipal court as indicated in section 46 of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 409&nbsp; (Revised Charter of the City of Manila), is equivalent to notice by&nbsp; personal service of a copy&nbsp; of the order or judgment.&nbsp; As the law expressly&nbsp; provides that appeals from judgment or orders of the municipal court are to be taken on&nbsp; the day following&nbsp; <i>the entry&nbsp; of&nbsp; judgment</i>,&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecuting officers are presumed to know this provision, and if they are&nbsp; interested in any order or judgment, they should take the trouble of consulting the record<br><br>We have decided not to resolve the issue and base our ruling on the case on a more&nbsp; plausible ground.&nbsp; All members&nbsp; of the Court are agreed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; has&nbsp; been guilty of&nbsp; laches in prosecuting this appeal.&nbsp; In&nbsp; view of the express provision of the law to the effect that appeals from orders and judgments&nbsp; can be appealed only on the day&nbsp; following their rendition and entry, it was the&nbsp; duty of the Fiscal to find out, within a reasonable time, whether a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; or order! has been&nbsp; entered in the&nbsp; case, so that an appeal there from may be perfected.&nbsp; The Fiscal was&nbsp; entirely&nbsp; wanting&nbsp; in&nbsp; that&nbsp; diligence&nbsp; expected&nbsp; of a public official&nbsp; interested in the faithful discharge of,&nbsp; his duties, and&nbsp; his&nbsp; failure to&nbsp; exercise the required&nbsp; diligence and&nbsp; care&nbsp; in respect to the case is&nbsp; inexcusable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without determining the issue&nbsp; presented by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government in this appeal, we&nbsp; hold that&nbsp; the cases should be&nbsp; dismissed because&nbsp; of laches on the part of the&nbsp; prosecuting&nbsp; officer. The&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp;&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is,&nbsp; therefore, affirmed, with costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oftcio.</span><br><br><i>Paras, C.
