respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila to issue a writ of 
execution in a case of unlawful detainer pending before him on appeal from the 
municipal court.
<p align="justify">It appears that the petitioner obtained judgment against the 
respondents Dionisio Pabiloña and Yu Tuy <em>alias</em> Yu Bontoy in the 
Municipal Court of Manila ordering said respondents to vacate the building known 
as the U.S.T. Restaurant and to pay rents and damages, which may be computed

<p align="justify">Said respondents received copy of the decision of the municipal 
court on September 7, 1948. They filed a notice of appeal, an appeal bond in the 
sum of P30, and a supersedeas bond in the sum of P11,200 to stay the execution 
of the judgment, on September 16, 1948. The supersedeas bond, which was given 
pursuant to section 8 of Rule 72 "to the plaintiff to enter the action in the 
Court of First Instance, and to pay the rents, damages, and costs down to the 
time of the final judgment in the action," was duly approved by the municipal 
court. On September 25, 1948, the appealed case was docketed in the Court of 
First Instance.</p>
<p align="justify">On October 13, 1948, the petitioner filed a motion before the 
respondent judge for the immediate execution of the judgment of the municipal 
court on the ground that the respondents (defendants below) had failed to pay to 
the plaintiff or into court on or before the 10th of October, 1948, the rent 
corresponding to the month of September. The respondent judge denied said 
motion, holding that the rent corresponding to the month of September, 1948, was 
included in the supersedeas bond of P1,200. The respondents have been depositing 
with the clerk of the Court below the rents for October, 1948, and succeeding 
months.</p>
<p align="justify">The only question to decide is whether the respondent judge was 
right in holding that the rent for September, 1948, was properly covered by the 
supersedeas bond.</p>
<p align="justify">It is well settled that the rents accruing after the perfection 
and during the pendency of the appeal must be deposited in court notwithstanding 
that the supersedeas bond answers for the rents, damages, and costs down to the 
time of the final judgment. (Mitschiener vs. Barrios,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 42 Off. Gaz., 1901; Zamora vs. 
Dinglasan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 43 Off. Gaz., 1627, 1631;

Ko vs. De Leon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> G. R. No. L-2484, May 
18, 1949.)</p>
<p align="justify">Of the adjudicated cases above cited, the most similar to the 
case at bar is Aylon vs. Jugo. In that case judgment was rendered by the 
municipal court on August 20, 1946, ordering the defendants to vacate the 
premises and to pay to the plaintiffs rentals at the rate of P60 a month 
beginning July 1, 1946. The defendants perfected the appeal on September 6, 
1946. The respondent judge therein ordered the execution of the judgment of the 
municipal court for failure of the defendants to pay into court the rents for 
July and August, 1946. This court revoked that order on the ground that said 
rentals were covered by the supersedeas bond of P300 given by the defendants to 
stay the execution. This court, speaking through Mr. Justice Padilla, held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"To prevent execution of a judgment against the defendant in 
forcible entry and detainer cases during the pendency of an appeal, only the 
rentals accruing after the perfection of the appeal need be paid to the 
plaintiff or deposited with the Court of First Instance, the unpaid rentals that 
had previously accrued being guaranteed by the bond filed to stay immediate 
execution in the justice of the peace or municipal court."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the present case the appeal and the supersedeas bond were 
approved by the municipal court on September, 16 and the appeal was docketed in 
the Court of First Instance on September 25, 1948. Since the greater part of the 
rent for the month of September had already accrued when the appeal was 
perfected and docketed in the Court of First Instance, and since in executing 
the supersedeas bond the defendants included therein the rent for the entire 
month of September and the municipal court approved said bond, we are inclined 
to believe and so hold that the respondent Judge acted within the purview of 
section 8 of Rule 72, as applied by this Court in Aylon vs. Jugo, 
<em>supra</em>, in denying the petitioner's motion for execution.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is denied, with costs against the petitioner.</p>

<div align="center"><br><strong>EXCERPTS FROM THE MINUTES OF JANUARY 11, 1950 
</strong></div>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Considering the motion for reconsideration filed by the 
petitioner in G.R. No. L-2672, University of Santo Tomas, petitioner, vs. Hon. 
Buenaventura Ocampo, etc., et al., respondents, the Court resolved as 
follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"The question involved is whether in a case of unlawful 
detainer the defendant-appellant must pay to the plaintiff or to the Court of 
First Instance from time to time the rent accruing from the date of the judgment 
of the municipal or justice of the peace court, or only the rent accruing after 
the perfection of the appeal provided that the rent accruing previous thereto is 
covered by the supersedeas bond given by the appellant. In the decision of this 
court under consideration it was held, following the decision in the case of 
Aylon vs. Jugo (45 O. G. 118),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that 
since the appeal was docketed in the Court of First Instance on September 25, 
1948, and since the rent for September, 1948, was included in the supersedeas 
bond given by the defendant-appellant, the latter was required to deposit in the 
Court of First Instance only the rent for October and succeeding months. 
Petitioner's contention that the portion of the syllabus in Aylon vs. Jugo 
quoted by this court in its decision in this case, to the effect that 'only the 
rentals accruing after the perfection of the appeal need be paid to the 
plaintiff or deposited with the Court of First Instance,' is not supported by 
the body of the decision, is unfounded. The portion of the decision in Aylon vs. 
Jugo from which the syllabus was taken reads as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"There is no dispute that, by virtue of the petitioner's appeal 
perfected on 6 September, the case was transmitted to, and docketed in, the 
Court of First Instance of Manila on 10 September. <em>Beginning from this last 
date or at the earliest from 6 September, when the Municipal Court lost 
jurisdiction over the case by virtue of the appeal perfected by the petitioner, 
the case may be said to be pending on appeal in the Court of First 
Instance</em>. Whether the bond filed by the petitioner as appellant is 
sufficient to answer for what the rule contemplates it must answer is not 
involved herein. The fact is that the bond was approved by the municipal court. 
Such being the case, the only question to determine is whether on the date of 
the order of execution of the judgment of the municipal court issued by the 
respondent court or during the pendency of the appeal, the petitioner, as 
appellant, failed to pay to respondent Pablo or to deposit into court the 
stipulated rental or the reasonable value for the use and occupation of the 
premises. The judgment rendered by the municipal court on 20 August 1946 ordered 
the defendants to pay to the plaintiffs the rentals thereof at the rate of P60 
per month beginning 1 July 1946 until they vacate and surrender said premises to 
the plaintiffs. The first rental to be paid by the petitioner, as appellant, to 
the respondent Pablo, as appellee, or to the Court, was for the month of 
September 1946 which had to be paid on or before the 10th day of October 1946. 
The payment of rentals for the preceding months of July and August is guaranteed 
by the bond for P300 filed by the petitioner, as appellant and principal, and 
the Luzon Surety Co., as surety. Consequently, the writ issued by the respondent 
Court on 24 September for the execution of the judgment rendered by the 
municipal court on 20 August and the order of 10 October denying in effect the 
motion for reconsideration of the previous order constitute a grave abuse of 
discretion which may be corrected by means of certiorari applied for herein.' 
(Underscoring supplied,)</p>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, reaffirming the above-quoted doctrine that only the 
rent accruing after the perfection of the appeal need be paid to the plaintiff 
or into court provided that the rent accruing previous thereto is cohered by the 
supersedeas bond, the COURT DENIED the motion."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><em>Motion denied</em>.</p>
