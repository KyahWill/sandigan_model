				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Baguio in case No. 513 dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with  costs against him, was  certified  to this Court by the Court of  Appeals pursuant to the provisions of section 17, Republic Act No.  206,  as amended,  on the ground that one of the issues raised  involves the validity of Ordinance No.  195,  as amended by Ordinance No. 200, series of 1954, of  the city of  Baguio.   The appellant does not dispute the  findings of  fact made  by the trial court and in his  brief raises only questions of law.</p>
<p>The facts, as found by the  trial court, are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Plaintiff was the owner of a building known as the Verzosa Bldg., located at No. 1 Session Road, City of  Baguio. Dr. Ernesto Abellera is the owner  of the  land on which the building stood.  The Verzosa Building was built under a temporary permit and was subsequently declared a fire hazard under Ordinances 195 and 200.  On December  31, 1954, the  City of Baguio was about  to take action for the demolition of  this building.  Plaintiff was then in the United States.  His  wife, Estelita F. Verzosa,  stepped into the breach and brought action against the  City to  stay the  demolition of the building which was obviously conjugal  property  of the Verzosa  spouses. She brought  an action known as Civil  Case No. 500.  The  City of Baguio entered  into  compromise with  Mrs. Verzosa whereby she agreed to demolish her building by February 28, 1955,  on condition that city services would be restored; her tenants allowed to reopen their stores  and  also would dismiss  Case No. 500.  The  City of Baguio faithfully complied with this  agreement.  But when demolition time  came, instead  of preparing to comply,  Plaintiff (who had returned to Baguio from the United States in.  the meantime) filed this present action praying for an injunction to  stay the demolition.  In effect,  Plaintiff repudiated the compromise entered into by his wife in  Case No. 500 on the ground that he had never  authorized her to file this kind of an action and that she did not hire the lawyers  he had suggested.  This  Court denied his petition for a writ of preliminary injunction,  and while Plaintiff's motion  for reconsideration to the same was pending, Defendant City Mayor, on orders from President Magsaysay, ordered the immediate demolition of the building.  Plaintiff then amended his complaint  to  include as defendants the  City Mayor as well as President Magsaysay. This Court held that it had no jurisdiction  to bring President Magsaysay within its sphere  and allowed the case to continue against the City of Baguio and its Mayor as the only two Defendants. * * *  (pp. 69-71, record on appeal).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trial court refrained from passing  upon  the constitutionality and validity of the ordinances and held that the appellant's  wife  in entering  into an agreement with the appellee,  the  City of Baguio, to  demolish the building in question on or before 28 February 1955  and to dismiss case No. 500 pending before  the Court of  First Instance of Baguio, acted as a gestor of  her absent husband, then on  a business trip to the United States, which agreement was binding  upon  him.</p>
<p>Section  2553  (h) of the Revised Administrative Code empowers the city council  of Baguio, by ordinance or resolution, "To establish fire limits, and regulate the kinds of buildings and structure that may be erected within said limits,  and the manner of  constructing and repairing the same," and section 2557 (d) of the same Code authorizes the City Engineer,  subject to the approval of the Mayor, "to cause buildings, dangerous to the public, to be made secure or torn  down, *  *  *."</p>
<p>The building in question was erected on a lot owned by the spouses Ernesto  L. M. Abellera and Angela Cabrera (Exhibit C) situate along Session Road, Baguio City, and1 declared by the City Council as within the "fire limits." It was formerly owned by John L. Wong who sold it to Lupo-Palasi (Exhibit B).  On 12 October 1950 the appellant acquired  it by purchase from Lupo Palasi  (Exhibit A).  The temporary  permit to construct the  building in question, issued by the acting City  Engineer in  favor of Milagros Sanchez Vda. de Wong on 20 October 1945, provides "that applicant will remove all improvements made in said lot within ten (10)  days notice from this Office/' (Exhibit 20.)  The appellant is,  therefore, charged with , knowledge of this condition when  he acquired the building from the previous transferee, Lupo Palasi, and cannot now complain that he was  deprived of his property without due process  of law.</p>
<p>In view of  the  foregoing, we need  not pass upon  the validity and binding effect,  of the compromise agreement entered  into by the appellant's wife for the demolition of the building on or before 28 February 1955 and constitutionality of Ordinance Nos.  195 and 200, series of 1954, of the city of  Baguio.</p>
<p>The  judgment  appealed from  is affirmed,  with costs against  the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C.  J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo,   Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes, </em>and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
