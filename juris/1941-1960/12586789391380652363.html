				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Gregorio&nbsp; P. de Guzman,&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant,&nbsp; was&nbsp; appointed Assistant Sanitary Inspector of&nbsp; San Jose, Nueva Ecija, by virtue of Resolution No.&nbsp; 72 of the&nbsp; Municipal Council of said town on&nbsp; June 17, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a civil service eligible.&nbsp; He assumed his post soon after his&nbsp; appointment.&nbsp; On March 25, 1955, defendant-appellee Jose B.&nbsp; Ramoso&nbsp; in his capacity&nbsp; as&nbsp; officer in&nbsp; charge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Provincial Health Office&nbsp; of Nueva&nbsp; Ecija,&nbsp; issued Special Order No. 3, series of 1955, directing Guzman to proceed to his new place of assignment, namely,&nbsp; the Municipality of&nbsp; Pantabangan,&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Ecija.&nbsp; Guzman&nbsp; challenged&nbsp; the validity&nbsp; of the order of assignment,&nbsp; refused to comply therewith and insisted on&nbsp; remaining in San Jose and working in his office,&nbsp; but it is claimed that Ramoso&nbsp; prevented him from doing so,&nbsp; resulting in his&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to receive&nbsp; his salary, and filed charges against Guzman for insubordination and threatened to&nbsp; investigate him. <br><br>In&nbsp; November,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; Guzman filed a petition&nbsp; for mandamus with preliminary&nbsp; injunction,&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1970, in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Nueva Ecija, alleging the facts above narrated, intimating that his assignment to Pantabangan&nbsp; was unconstitutional and arbitrary and equivalent to removal from office,&nbsp; claiming that by reason of the wrongful act of Ramoso in restraining him from the enjoyment of his office as Assistant Sanitary Inspector of San Jose, he had suffered damages in the amount of P2,000 as actual damages, P10,000 as moral damages&nbsp; and P5,000 as exemplary damages, and he asked that Ramoso be ordered to pay the damages; to allow him to "use&nbsp; and enjoy the office of Assistant Sanitary&nbsp; Inspector of&nbsp; San Jose,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, and&nbsp; enjoy&nbsp; its emolument and rights pertaining thereto"; to pay to&nbsp; him his&nbsp; back salary from April 1,&nbsp; 1955 up to the termination of&nbsp; the case,&nbsp; and to enjoin Ramoso from investigating him. <br><br>Ramoso filed a motion to dismiss the petition, claiming that the&nbsp; assignment of&nbsp; Guzman to Pantabangan was not a permanent transfer or assignment for the reason that only the Municipal&nbsp; Council can&nbsp; appoint a Sanitary Inspector,&nbsp; but that&nbsp; it was only&nbsp; a&nbsp; transfer&nbsp; or assignment temporary in nature.&nbsp; Guzman filed&nbsp; a written opposition to the motion to dismiss supporting&nbsp; the same with arguments.&nbsp; On November 25, 1955,&nbsp; the Nueva Ecija court found that under his&nbsp; (Ramoso's)&nbsp; general and supervisory powers under Section 980&nbsp; of the Revised Administrative Code, he had inherent power&nbsp; to reshuffle the personnel under his jurisdiction, but only on a temporary basis, as for instance, should an epidemic arise in a certain municipality and the Sanitary Inspector in&nbsp; said town is incapacitated to&nbsp; perform his&nbsp; duties, then the&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Health Officer may designate&nbsp; a sanitary inspector&nbsp; from another municipality to take over, but that this&nbsp; power of the Provincial Health Officer cannot be used to interfere with the civil service tenure of his&nbsp; employees, harass them or remove them&nbsp; under the guise of&nbsp; temporary transfer or assignment, and special order No. 3 in question did not say that&nbsp; it was a temporary&nbsp; arrangement.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; upon the explanation given by Ramoso, the court was satisfied that he issued the order without&nbsp; any intention of&nbsp; permanently transferring Guzman from his permanent station,&nbsp; and that it was made only for the good of the service, for the reason that the incumbent sanitary&nbsp; inspector in&nbsp; Pantabangan was absent on leave and it&nbsp; was necessary to assign another sanitary inspector in his place in the meantime.&nbsp; The court further found that under the law, the Provincial Board and the District&nbsp; Health Officer had the right to investigate the President of the Sanitary Division and the Sanitary Inspectors, so that the investigation intended to be made by Ramoso and upon&nbsp; complaint against Guzman, was authorized by law. <br><br>By order of January 6, 1956, the lower court dismissed the petition but decreed that the assignment of Guzman to Pantabangan be of temporary&nbsp; character to&nbsp; last only during&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of the&nbsp; regular&nbsp; incumbent&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pantabangan, and in no&nbsp; case to exceed 30 days.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of dismissal&nbsp; filed by Guzman was denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the reasons for said dismissal was that Guzman had already been ordered to report for duty to the Municipal Health Office of&nbsp; San Jose instead of Pantabangan; that he had already reported for&nbsp; duty effective December 8, 1955,&nbsp; and having been able to collect his salary from December 8 to December 31, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guzman did not appeal from the order of dismissal. <br><br>On February 6, 1956, Guzman commenced the present action against Ramoso,&nbsp; in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Nueva Ecija making the&nbsp; same allegations contained&nbsp; in his petition for mandamus&nbsp; in Civil&nbsp; Case No. 1970, asking for the same&nbsp; remedies, including&nbsp; his backpay or salary from April 1 to December 7, 1955, plus P500 for attorney's fees.&nbsp; Ramoso filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the unappealed order of dismissal in Civil Case No. 1970 barred the present action.&nbsp; Guzman opposed the&nbsp; motion to dismiss.&nbsp; The court&nbsp; held&nbsp; a preliminary hearing in which the defendant without objection offered the same evidence adduced&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1970,&nbsp; after which,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court by order of March 13, 1956,&nbsp; dismissed the case on the ground of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">res adjudicata. </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;">Guzman is now&nbsp; appealing from said order of dismissal. <br><br>Despite appellant's claim that the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">res adjudicata </span>is not applicable for the reason that Civil Case No. 1970&nbsp; was not decided&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; merits but was merely dismissed,&nbsp; we agree with the trial court that said case bars the present action.&nbsp; Although Civil Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1970 was dismissed, nevertheless, the rights&nbsp; of the parties therein were&nbsp; adjudicated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, on the manifestations and admissions of both parties, if not on the evidence adduced, the trial&nbsp; court there&nbsp; held that&nbsp; Guzman&nbsp; could&nbsp; not be permanently transferred or appointed to another town as Assistant Sanitary Inspector,&nbsp; but&nbsp; that&nbsp; his&nbsp; assignment to Pantabangan was&nbsp; only temporary,&nbsp; to act during the leave of absence of the incumbent in that town, which temporary assignment was within the powers&nbsp; of the District Health Officer of Nueva Ecija, and the court even fixed the period of&nbsp; assignment not to exceed&nbsp; 30&nbsp; days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, the trial&nbsp; court found that&nbsp; Ramoso acted&nbsp; within the scope of his powers as acting District&nbsp; Health&nbsp; Officer, and in good faith&nbsp; without any ulterior motive;&nbsp; that Guzman was not entitled to&nbsp; the&nbsp; damages&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; by&nbsp; him, including&nbsp; his prayer to receive his back salary from April 1 to December 7, 1955.&nbsp; As already stated, Guzman failed to appeal from that order of dismissal which&nbsp; naturally&nbsp; became final. <br><br>In view of the foregoing, the order of dismissal appealed from&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against appellants. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
