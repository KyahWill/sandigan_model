				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Hon. 
Edilberto Barot, presiding, dismissing the action which was brought to recover 
two lots sold by plaintiff and her co-owner to the defendants.
<p>On and before November 29, 1943, Florencia R. Soriano and her brother Teodoro 
R. Soriano were the registered co-owners, and their father Ramon Soriano 
(widower), the registered usufructuary of Lots Nos. 16 and 17, Block No. 1881 of 
the cadastral survey of Manila, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
6147 of the Registry of Deeds of Manila. On November 29, 1943, the above 
co-owners and usufructuary sold the said lots to Ong Hoo for P160,000, of which 
P90,000 was paid at the time of the sale and P70,000 on December 4, 1943. On 
January 17, 1944, Ong Hoo registered the deed of sale executed in his favor and, 
thereupon, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 70030 was issued in his name. Ramon 
Soriano died on September 15, 1944 and Teodoro R. Soriano, on September 5, 1946 
and as they both died intestate, Florencia R. Soriano as their sole heir 
succeeded in their rights to said properties.</p>
<p>On January 16, 1946, Ong Hoo sold the land to defendants Chung Te, Ching Leng 
and Ching Tan. The sale was registered on January 22, 1946 and, thereupon, 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 9597 of Manila was issued in their name.</p>
<p>The above facts appear in the stipulation of facts submitted by the parties 
in this case. The complaint alleges that both the original sale and the 
subsequent transfer made are null and void because the vendee and transferees 
are Chinese citizens and cannot acquire ownership of private agricultural land. 
It is, therefore, prayed that the sale executed in favor of the defendants be 
declared null and void and that the plaintiff be declared owner of the lots upon 
reimbursement by her of the price of the sale. The defendants in their answer 
allege that the complaint states no cause of action, inasmuch as the plaintiffs 
had participated in the execution of an illegal contract and so they can not 
maintain an action to recover what they had conveyed by virtue thereof; that 
defendants are innocent purchasers of the property for value; and that the sale 
was executed during the Japanese regime, at which time the Constitution of the 
Philippines was not in force. </p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of Manila held that the sale cannot be annulled 
at the instance of the vendor or vendors citing the cases of Cabauatan, et al., 
vs. Uy Hoo, 88 Phil., 108; Ricamara, et al. vs. Ngo Ki, G.R. No. L-5836, April 
29, 1953; and especially Rellosa vs. Gaw Chee Hun, 93 Phil., 827; 49 Off. Gaz., 
[10], 4345.</p>
<p>It is argued on this appeal that the principle of in part delicto is not 
applicable to the vendors for the reason that the provision of law supposed to 
have been violated is not a very clear provision but is a doubtful one, and its 
interpretation could have been the subject of mistake on the part of any of the 
parties. The constitutional prohibition against the acquisition of agricultural 
lands by aliens is absolute and unconditional; it contains no saving clause in 
favor of those who were not aware of its meaning or implications. The argument 
of the appellant is also contrary to the general rule of law that knowledge 
thereof is to be presumed. The claim that the principle of in pari delicto does 
not apply to the plaintiffs is, therefore, without merit.</p>
<p>It is also claimed that, in consonance with the policy of the State to retain 
lands in favor of its citizens and prohibiting aliens from acquiring them, the 
vendor in the case at bar should be allowed to recover back the property in the 
same manner as holders of homesteads who have disposed of the same as decided by 
Us in the case of Eugenio, et al. vs. Perdido, et al.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> G. R. No. L-7083, May 19, 1955. Distinction 
should be made between the prohibition against the disposition of homesteads and 
the prohibition made in the Constitution against the acquisition of lands by 
aliens. The evident purpose of the Public Land Law, especially the provisions 
thereof in relation to homesteads, is to conserve ownership of lands acquired as 
homesteads in the homesteader or his heirs. (De los Santos vs. Roman Catholic 
Church of Midsayap,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> 50 Off. Gaz., [4], 
1588; Acierto vs. De los Santos,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span> G.R. 
No. L-5828, Sept. 29, 1954; Eugenio, et al. vs. Perdido, et al., supra; Angeles, 
et al. vs. The Court of Appeals,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> G.R. 
No. L-11024, Jan. 31, 1958.) This is evident from the provisions of the law, 
such as the prohibition against sale of the homestead within a period of five 
years from and after the date of the issuance of the patent or grant, and after 
five years and before 25 years after issuance of title without the consent of 
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources (C.A. No. 141, section 118), 
and the permission granted the homesteader or his legal heirs to repurchase the 
land within five years from the date of the conveyance (Id., Sec. 119). In the 
case of the constitutional prohibition, the law is silent; it merely prohibits 
acquisition of land by foreigners. The prohibition stops there; as to the 
effects or results of a violation of the prohibition, both with respect to the 
citizen selling his land and the alien purchasing or acquiring the same, the 
Constitution is silent. If the citizen voluntarily disposes of his property, it 
would seem too much to expect that the law should order the return of the 
property to him. In the United States where a prohibition similar to our 
constitutional prohibition exists, it has been held that the vendor has no 
recourse against the vendee despite the alien's disability to hold the property, 
and that it is only the State that is entitled by proceedings in the nature of 
office found to have a forfeiture or escheat declared against the vendee who is 
incapable of holding title. (Vasquez vs. Li Seng Giap, et al.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> G.R. No. L-3676, January 31, 1955.) As the 
Constitution is silent as to the effects or consequences of a sale by a citizen 
of his land to an alien, and as both the citizen and the alien have violated the 
law, none of them should have a recourse against the other, and it should only 
be the State that should be allowed to intervene and determine what is to be 
done with the property subject of the violation. We have said that what the 
State should do or could do in such matters is a matter of public policy, 
entirely beyond the scope of judicial authority. (Dinglasan, et al. vs. Lee Bun 
Ting, et al.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> G.R. No. L-5996, June 27, 
1956.) While the legislature has not definitely decided what policy should be 
followed in cases of violations against the constitutional prohibition, courts 
of justice cannot go beyond by declaring the disposition to be null and void as 
violative of the Constitution. We, therefore, feel We are not in a position to 
concede the remedy prayed for, for which reason the judgment dismissing the 
action should be, as it hereby is, affirmed, with costs against the 
plaintiffs.</p>

<div align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i> </div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>REYES,</b> <i>J. B. L</i>., J., </p>
<p>While the opinion of Justice Labrador is fully supported by authority, I 
believe the time is ripe for a revision of the position of the Court in cases of 
alien land tenures. </p>
<p>For thirteen years since liberation, the Legislature has failed to enact a 
statute for the escheat of agricultural lands acquired by aliens in violation of 
the Constitution. Between this apparent reluctance of the legislative branch to 
implement the prohibition embodied in section 5 of Art. XIII of our fundamental 
charter, and the strict application by the courts of the part delicto rule, the 
result has been that aliens continue to hold and enjoy lands admittedly acquired 
contrary to constitutional prohibitions, just as if the inhibition did not 
exist.</p>
<p>In view of the prolonged legislative inaction, it is up to the courts to 
vindicate the Constitution by declaring the <i>pari delicto</i> rule not applicable to 
these transactions. After all, the rule is but an instrument of the public 
policy, and its application is justified only in so far as it enforces that 
policy. Therefore, where its continued application to a given set of cases leads 
to results plainly contrary to the wording and spirit of the Constitution, there 
is every reason, to discard it. Otherwise, the express rule against alien land 
tenures will speedily become the object of mockery and derision.</p>
<p>It may be that Filipinos who parted with their lands in favor of aliens 
morally do not deserve protection; but they are in no worse case than the alien 
purchasers, and moreover the Constitution is clearly in their favor. I submit 
that it is more important that the constitutional inhibition be enforced than to 
wait for another branch of the government to take the initiative.</p>
