				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; the decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Quezon City, dismissing plaintiff's complaint for the recovery of accrued salaries,&nbsp; first taken to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals, and later certified to us for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; said appeal&nbsp; involved only questions of law. The facts are simple and Clear, and as found by the trial court may be briefly&nbsp; stated as follows:<br><br>The Rural Progress Administration&nbsp; (later referred to as&nbsp; Administration)&nbsp; is a public corporation created&nbsp; for the purpose of acquiring landed estates through&nbsp; purchase, expropriation or lease, and later sub-letting or sub-leasing the same to&nbsp; tenants or occupants.&nbsp; The officials and employees of the Administration&nbsp; may be considered as civil service employees embraced in the classified service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in 1947, one&nbsp; Aurelio&nbsp; R. Pefia, then comptroller of the Administration and performing duties of auditor in representation of the Auditor General recommended&nbsp; to the Board of Directors of the Administration that for purposes of&nbsp; economy&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; treasurers&nbsp; be appointed&nbsp;&nbsp; agent-collectors of the Administration, and this recommendation was adopted by the Board of Director.&nbsp; Thereafter,&nbsp; Faustino Aguilar, then manager of the Administration, prepared the appointment for the post of agent-collector on a parttime basis in favor of plaintiff-appellant Braulio Quimson, with compensation of&nbsp; P720 per annum, the appointment to take effect&nbsp; upon assumption of duty.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the&nbsp; time, Quimson was deputy provincial treasurer and&nbsp; municipal treasurer&nbsp; of Caloocan, Rizal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant-appellee Roman Ozaeta who by reason&nbsp; of his office of Secretary&nbsp; of Justice was. acting as ...Chairman of the Board of Directors, signed the appointment and forwarded the papers to the President through the Secretary&nbsp; of Finance for approval.&nbsp; Without waiting for the said approval Quimson assumed his position on May 6, 1948 and rendered service as agent-collector of the Administration until October 21,&nbsp; 1949, inclusive'," when he was informed that Because of the disapproval of his appointment, his services were considered terminated. There were several objections to his, appointment,'' among them that of the&nbsp; Auditor&nbsp; General on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that since Quimson was&nbsp; deputy&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; treasurer and municipal treasurer of Caloocan; his&nbsp; additional compensation as&nbsp; agent-collector&nbsp; would contravene&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitutional prohibition&nbsp; against&nbsp; double&nbsp; compensation.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Commissioner of Civil Service said that he would offer no objection to the&nbsp; additional&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quimson&nbsp; as&nbsp; agent collector provided&nbsp; it was authorized in a special provision exempting the case from the inhibition against the payment of extra compensation in accordance with section 259. of the Revised Administrative Code.&nbsp; In this connection, it may be stated that this section of the Administrative Code provides that in the absence of special provision, no officer or employee in any branch&nbsp; of. the Government service shall&nbsp; receive additional&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; on&nbsp; account of&nbsp; the discharge of duties pertaining to another or to the performance&nbsp; of public service&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; whatever&nbsp; nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; Faustino Aguilar as&nbsp; manager of the Administration asked for the reconsideration of the ruling&nbsp; of the Auditor General, alleging that the appointment of the plaintiff was&nbsp; for reasons of economy and efficiency, but the Auditor General denied the&nbsp; request stating&nbsp; that reasons&nbsp; of economy&nbsp; and efficiency are not valid grounds for evading the&nbsp; constitutional prohibition against additional compensation&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence of a law specifically authorizing such compensation. So, the&nbsp; services of Quimson&nbsp; as agent-collector of&nbsp; the Administration were terminated.&nbsp; But R. Gonzales Lloret, then manager of the Administration on October 18,&nbsp; 1949, inquired from the auditor of the Administration whether Quimson could be&nbsp; paid for the period of actual service rendered by him from May 10, 1948, and the said auditor gave the opinion that it could not be done for the reason that in&nbsp; his opinion the appointment extended&nbsp; to&nbsp; Quimson was clearly illegal&nbsp; and the Administration&nbsp; may not be obliged&nbsp; to pay him for the services rendered since it was a violation of section 3,&nbsp; Article XII, of the Constitution prohibiting&nbsp; double&nbsp; compensation.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; same&nbsp; time he expressed the opinion that under section 691 of the Revised Administrative Code the appointing official who made&nbsp; the illegal appointment should be made liable, for the&nbsp; payment of&nbsp; salary of&nbsp; the appointee,&nbsp; and consequently,&nbsp; plaintiff should claim his salary for services rendered against said appointing officer. . It is highly possible that this opinion was what induced and prompted Quimson to file the present case against Roman Ozaeta who, as Chairman of the Board, signed his appointment, and the members of the said Board, namely: Faustino Aguilar, Vicente Fragante, Roman Fer- nandez and Pedro Magsalin.&nbsp;&nbsp; The. action was initiated in the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court which dismissed the complaint.&nbsp; On&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Quezon&nbsp; City,&nbsp; as already stated,&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint was also dismissed.<br><br>For purposes of reference we&nbsp; are reproducing section 691 of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code, to wit:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 691. <i>Payment of person employed contrary to law.</i>—Liability of chief&nbsp; of&nbsp; office.—No&nbsp; person&nbsp; employed' in the&nbsp; classified&nbsp; service contrary to law or in&nbsp; violation of the civil service rules shall be entitled to receive&nbsp; pay from the&nbsp; Government; but the chief of the bureau or office responsible for such unlawful&nbsp; employment shall be personally liable for the pay that would have accrued had the employment been&nbsp; lawful,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; disbursing officer&nbsp; shall&nbsp; make payment to the employee of such amount from the salary of the officers so&nbsp; liable."<br></blockquote>In our opinion, the present appeal can be resolved without much difficulty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 691 of the Administrative&nbsp; Code above reproduced refers and applies to unlawful employment and not to unlawful compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointment or employment&nbsp; of plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; Quimson&nbsp; as agent-collector was not in&nbsp; itself&nbsp; unlawful&nbsp; because there is no incompatibility between&nbsp; said appointment and his employment as deputy provincial treasurer and municipal treasurer.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, he was appointed agent-collector&nbsp; by reason of his office, being a municipal treasurer.&nbsp; There is no legal objection&nbsp; to a government&nbsp; official occupying two government offices and&nbsp; performing the functions of&nbsp; both as long as there is no incompatibility.&nbsp; Clerks of court are sometimes appointed&nbsp; or designated, aa provincial&nbsp; sheriffs. Municipal Treasurers, like plaintiff are often appointed and designated as deputy provincial treasurer.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Department Secretaries are often,designated to act as&nbsp; Chairman or members of Board of Directors of government corporations.&nbsp; The objection&nbsp; or prohibition refers to double&nbsp; compensation and not to double appointments and performance of functions of more&nbsp; than one office.<br><br>According to law, under certain circumstances, the President&nbsp; may authorize double&nbsp; compensation in some cases, such as government officials acting as members&nbsp; with&nbsp; compensation in government examining boards like&nbsp; the bar examinations, or department&nbsp; secretaries acting as members of Board of Directors&nbsp; of&nbsp; government corporations, and in such cases the prohibition against double compensation is not observed.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; undoubtedly, was the reason&nbsp; why the appointment&nbsp; of Quimson had to be&nbsp; coursed&nbsp; through different offices like the Department of Finance, the&nbsp; Civil Service Commission, and the Office of the Auditor General to the President&nbsp; for approval.&nbsp; If the President approves the double compensation, well and good.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointee whose appointment may then be regarded as valid from the beginning could receive extra&nbsp; compensation.&nbsp; If it is disapproved, then&nbsp; the appointment will have to be withdrawn or cancelled, unless of course,&nbsp; the appointee was willing&nbsp; to serve without&nbsp; compensation,&nbsp; in which&nbsp; case there could be no&nbsp; valid objection.&nbsp; This is another proof that the appointment of Quimson was not illegal or unlawful.&nbsp; It was only the double compensation that was subject to objection.&nbsp; The trouble was that plaintiff herein assumed office without&nbsp; waiting&nbsp; for&nbsp; the result&nbsp; of the action to be' taken upon his appointment and compensation by the President and the&nbsp; different offices which the appointment had to go through.<br><br>Furthermore,&nbsp; Quimson would appear to have&nbsp; assumed office without notifying the&nbsp; official&nbsp; who&nbsp; appointed him, namely, Roman Ozaeta.&nbsp; Plaintiff, therefore, took the risk or hazard of not being paid&nbsp; for any&nbsp; service that he may render in the meantime.&nbsp; His counsel now contends that the appointing official should&nbsp; have&nbsp; known that double compensation was prohibited by law and therefore he should not&nbsp; have appointed Quimson as&nbsp; agent-collector.&nbsp; That&nbsp; is seemingly a plausible&nbsp; stand.&nbsp; But it should be borne in mind that there are&nbsp; exceptions&nbsp; to the prohibition;&nbsp; that the very&nbsp; comptroller of the&nbsp; Administration, representing the&nbsp; Auditor&nbsp; General,&nbsp; recommended&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointment of municipal treasurers, like the plaintiff; as agent-collectors,. and so&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Ozaeta and the other&nbsp; members&nbsp; of the Board of Directors may have believed that the Chief Executive might&nbsp; approve plaintiff's&nbsp; appointment.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; it may also be said that&nbsp; Quimson himself; a Deputy Provincial Treasurer and Municipal Treasurer, a financial officer , expected&nbsp; to be&nbsp; tersed&nbsp; in&nbsp; government disbursements and payments of salaries and&nbsp; compensation should&nbsp; have 'also known&nbsp; and undoubtedly he&nbsp; knew about&nbsp; that prohibition against double compensation.&nbsp; He should&nbsp; have known that his appointment had to go over or through several obstacles and hazards, but he took the risk and began serving, as agent-collector&nbsp; before his, appointment was approved.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are afraid that he has no one to blame but himself<br><br>Finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C.
