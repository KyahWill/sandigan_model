				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>The case</i>.—Quintin, Francisco,&nbsp; Crisanta and Juliana, all surnamed&nbsp; de&nbsp; Borja, are the legitimate children of Marcelo&nbsp; de Borja,&nbsp; who, upon his demise sometime in 1924 or 1925, left&nbsp; a&nbsp; considerable&nbsp; amount of property.&nbsp; Intestate proceedings must have followed,&nbsp; and the pre-war&nbsp; records of the case either&nbsp; burned,&nbsp; lost or&nbsp; destroyed during the last&nbsp; war, because the record shows that in 1930 Quintin de Borja was&nbsp; already the&nbsp; administrator of the Intestate Estate of Marcelo de&nbsp; Borja.<br><br>In&nbsp; the early part of 1938,&nbsp; Quintín de&nbsp; Borja died and Crisanto de&nbsp; Borja, son of&nbsp; Francisco de&nbsp; Borja, was appointed&nbsp; and&nbsp; took&nbsp; over as&nbsp; administrator of the&nbsp; Estate. Francisco de Borja, on the other hand,&nbsp; assumed&nbsp; his duties as executor of the will&nbsp; of Quintín de Borja,&nbsp; but upon petition&nbsp; of the heirs of said deceased on the ground that his interests were&nbsp; conflicting with&nbsp; that of his brother's estate, he&nbsp; was later required by the Court to&nbsp; resign as such&nbsp; executor&nbsp; and&nbsp; was succeeded&nbsp; by Rogelio&nbsp; Limaco,&nbsp; a son-in-law of Quintín de Borja.<br><br>It also appears that on February&nbsp; 16, 1940, at the hearing set for the approval of the statement of accounts of the late&nbsp; administrator of the Intestate Estate of Marcelo de Borja, then being&nbsp; opposed by Francisco de&nbsp; Borja, the parties submitted an&nbsp; agreement, which was approved by the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; A).&nbsp; Said&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; translated&nbsp; into English, reads as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>&nbsp; All the accounts submitted&nbsp; and those that are to be submitted corresponding to&nbsp; this year will be considered approved;<br></li><li>&nbsp; No heir shall&nbsp; claim anything of&nbsp; the harvests from the lands in Cainta that came from Exequiel Ampil, deceased, nor from the land&nbsp; in Tabuatin, Nueva Ecija;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That the amounts of money taken by each heir shall&nbsp; be considered as deposited in conjunction with the other properties of the Intestate&nbsp; and&nbsp; shall form part of the mass without drawing any interest;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That it shall&nbsp; be understood&nbsp; as included in this mass&nbsp; the sum of twelve thousand pesos (P12,000) that the sisters&nbsp; Crisanta and Juliana de Borja paid of their own money&nbsp; as part of the&nbsp; price&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lands in&nbsp; Cainta and three thousand pesos&nbsp; (P3,000) the price Of the machinery for irrigation;<br></li><li>&nbsp; The right, interests or participation that the deceased Quintín de Borja&nbsp; has&nbsp; or. may have in Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 6190&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, shall be&nbsp; likewise included in the total mass of the inheritance of the Intestate;<br></li><li>&nbsp; Not only the lands in Tabuatin but also those in Cainta coming' from the&nbsp; now&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Exequiel&nbsp; Ampil shall&nbsp; also form&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the total mass of the inheritance&nbsp; of the Intestate of the late Marcelo&nbsp; de Borja;<br></li><li>&nbsp; Once the&nbsp; total of the inheritance&nbsp; of the Intestate is made up as specified before in&nbsp; this Agreement,&nbsp; partition thereof&nbsp; will&nbsp; be made as follows:</li></ol>From the total mass shall be deducted in&nbsp; case or in kind, Twelve Thousand&nbsp; Pesos (P12,000) that shall&nbsp; be delivered to Da.&nbsp; Juliana de Borja and&nbsp; Da. Crisanta&nbsp; de&nbsp; Borja in&nbsp; equal&nbsp; shares, and the rest&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; divided among the&nbsp; four heirs, i.&nbsp; e., Don&nbsp; Francisco de Borja, the heirs of&nbsp; Quintin de Borja, Da, Juliana de&nbsp; Borja and&nbsp; Da. Crisanta de Borja,&nbsp; in equal&nbsp; parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; (TRANSLATION)</blockquote>The&nbsp; Intestate&nbsp;&nbsp; remained under the administration&nbsp; of Crisanto de Borja until&nbsp; the outbreak of&nbsp; the&nbsp; war.&nbsp; From then on and until the termination of the war, there was a lull and state of inaction in Special Proceeding No.&nbsp; 2414 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Pasig&nbsp; branch (In the&nbsp; Matter of&nbsp; the Intestate Estate of Marcelo de Borja), until upon petition filed&nbsp; by Miguel B. Dayco, as&nbsp; administrator of the estate&nbsp; of his deceased mother,&nbsp; Crisanta&nbsp; de Borja,&nbsp; who&nbsp; is one of&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs,&nbsp; for the reconstitution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; records of this case,&nbsp; the Court on December 11, 194&amp;, ordered the&nbsp; reconstitution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same, requiring the administrator to submit his report and a copy of the project of partition.<br><br>On January&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1946, the administrator,&nbsp; Dr. Crisanto de Borja,&nbsp; filed&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp; accounts&nbsp; for the&nbsp; period ranging from March&nbsp; 1 to&nbsp; December 22,&nbsp; 1945,&nbsp; which according&nbsp; to the heirs of Quintín de Borja were so inadequate and general that on February 28, 1946, they filed a motion for specification.&nbsp; On April 30, 1946,&nbsp; they also filed their opposition to said statement of accounts alleging that the income reported in said&nbsp; statement was&nbsp; very much less than the true and actual income of the estate and that the expenses appearing&nbsp; therein were&nbsp; exaggerated and/or not&nbsp; actually incurred, and prayed that&nbsp; the statement of accounts submitted by&nbsp; the administrator be disapproved.<br><br>The administrator later filed another report&nbsp; of his administration, dated August 9,&nbsp; 1949, corresponding to the period lapsed from December&nbsp; 23, 1945, to&nbsp; July 31, 1949, showing a&nbsp; cash balance&nbsp; of P71.96,&nbsp; but with pending obligation amounting to P35.415.<br><br>On August 22, 1949, Juan de Borja&nbsp; and sisters, heirs of the deceased Quintín de&nbsp; Borja,&nbsp; filed their&nbsp; opposition to the statement of accounts&nbsp; filed by the administrator on the ground that same was not detailed enough to enable the interested parties to verify the same; that they cannot&nbsp; understand why the Intestate&nbsp; could suffer any loss considering that&nbsp; during the administration of the same by the late Quintin de Borja, the Estate accumulated gains of more than P100,000&nbsp; in the form&nbsp; of advances to&nbsp; the heirs as well as cash balance; that they desired to examine the accounts of Dr.&nbsp; Crisanto de Borja&nbsp; to verify&nbsp; the loss and&nbsp; therefore prayed that the administrator be&nbsp; ordered to deposit&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clerk of Court all books, receipts, accounts and other&nbsp; papers&nbsp; pertaining&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Estate&nbsp; of Marcelo&nbsp; de Borja.&nbsp; This motion was&nbsp; answered by&nbsp; the administrator contending that&nbsp; the Report referred to was already clear&nbsp; and enough, the income&nbsp; as well as the expenditures&nbsp; being&nbsp; specified&nbsp; therein;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had to&nbsp; spend for the repairs of the properties of the Estate damaged during the Japanese&nbsp; occupation; that the allegation that during the administration of Quintin de Borja the Estate realized a profit of P100,000 was not true, because instead of gain there was even a shortage&nbsp; in the funds although said administrator had collected all his fees&nbsp; (<i>honorarios</i>) and commissions&nbsp; corresponding to the entire period of his incumbency;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; mentioned in&nbsp; said Report will&nbsp; be liquidated before the termination of the proceedings in the same manner as it is done in any other intestate case; that he was willing to submit all the receipts of the accounts for the examination of the interested parties before the Clerk or before the&nbsp; Court itself;&nbsp; that this Intestate could be terminated, the project of partition having been&nbsp; allowed and confirmed by the Supreme Court and that the Administrator was alsodesirous of termina- ting it definitely for the benefit of all the parties.&nbsp; .<br><br>On September 14, 1949, the administrator&nbsp; filed another statement of accounts covering the period of from March 1, 1945, to&nbsp; July&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; which showed&nbsp; a cash balance of P71.95, with pending obligations in&nbsp; the sum of P35,810.<br><br>The&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of Quintín de Borja, Juan de&nbsp; Borja and his sisters, registered their opposition&nbsp; to&nbsp; said statement of accounts and prayed the Court to disapprove the same and to appoint an accountant to go over the books of the administrator and to submit a report thereon as soon as possible. The heir Juliana&nbsp; de&nbsp; Borja also formally offered her objection&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; accounts&nbsp; submitted by the&nbsp; administrator and prayed further that said administrator&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp; required&nbsp; to&nbsp; submit a&nbsp; complete accounting of his&nbsp; administration of. the Estate from&nbsp; 1937 to 1949. On the other hand,&nbsp; Francisco de Borja&nbsp; and Miguel B. Dayco,&nbsp; as the only&nbsp; heir of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Crisanta&nbsp; de Borja,&nbsp; submitted to the Court an agreement to relieve the administrator from&nbsp; accounting for the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; the Japanese occupation;&nbsp; that as to the accounting from&nbsp; 1937 to 1941, they affirmed their conformity with the agreement entered into by all the heirs appearing in the Bill of&nbsp; Exceptions of&nbsp; Juliana&nbsp; de&nbsp; Borja; and that&nbsp; they&nbsp; have no objection to&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the statement of&nbsp; accounts submitted by the&nbsp; administrator covering the years 1945 to 1949.<br><br>On December 6,&nbsp; 1949, the administrator,&nbsp; answered the opposition of the heir Juliana de Borja, alleging that the corresponding statement of accounts for the years 1937, 1938, 1939,&nbsp; 1940 and 1941 were presented&nbsp; and approved by the Court before&nbsp; and during the Japanese occupation, but the records of&nbsp; the same were&nbsp; destroyed in the Office of the Clerk of that Court during the liberation of the province of&nbsp; Rizal,&nbsp; and his&nbsp; personal records were also lost during&nbsp; the&nbsp; Japanese occupation,&nbsp; when his&nbsp; house&nbsp; was burned;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Peña&nbsp; who was&nbsp; presiding&nbsp; over the Court in 1945&nbsp; impliedly denied the petition of the heirs to require&nbsp; him&nbsp; to&nbsp; render&nbsp; an&nbsp; accounting&nbsp; for the period from 1942 to the early part of 1945,&nbsp; for the reason that whatever money obtained from the&nbsp; Estate during said period could not be made the subject of any adjudication it having been declared fiat money&nbsp; and without value, and ordered that the statement of accounts be presented only for the period starting from March 1, 1945.&nbsp; The administrator&nbsp; further&nbsp; stated that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was anxious&nbsp; to terminate this&nbsp; administration but some of&nbsp; the heirs&nbsp; had&nbsp; not yet complied with&nbsp; the&nbsp; conditions imposed in the project of partition which was approved by the Supreme Court; that in accordance with said partition&nbsp; agreement, Juliana de Borja must deliver to the administrator all the jewelry, objects&nbsp; of value, utensils&nbsp; and&nbsp; other personal belongings of the&nbsp; deceased spouses Marcelo&nbsp; de&nbsp; Borja and&nbsp; Tárcila Quiogue, which said heir had kept and continued to retain in her possession; that the heirs&nbsp; of Quintín de Bbrja should deliver to the&nbsp; administrator all&nbsp; the lands and a document transferring in favor of the&nbsp; Intestate the two parcels of land with a total&nbsp; area of&nbsp; 71 hectares of cultivated land in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija which were in the possession of said heirs, together with the&nbsp; house of Feliciana Mariano Vda. de&nbsp; Sarangaya, which&nbsp; were the objects&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil Case No. 6190 mentioned in Paragraph 11&nbsp; of the&nbsp; project of partition; that as&nbsp; a consequence of the said dispossession, the heirs of Quintín de Borja must&nbsp; deliver to the administrator&nbsp; the products of the 71&nbsp; hectares of land in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, and the rentals of the house of Feliciana Mariano or else render to the Court an accounting of the products&nbsp; of these properties from the time they took possession of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1937 to the present; that there was a pending&nbsp; obligation amounting to P36,000 as of September 14, 1949, which the heirs should pay before the properties&nbsp; adjudicated&nbsp; to&nbsp; them would be delivered. The Court, however, ordered the administrator on December 10, 1949, to show and prove by evidence why he should not be&nbsp; required to&nbsp; include&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; accounts the&nbsp; proceeds&nbsp; of his administration from 1937.<br><br>Meantime, Juliana de&nbsp; Borja filed a&nbsp; <i>Constancia</i> denying possession of any jewelry belonging to the deceased spouses Marcelo de Borja and&nbsp; Tarcila Quiogue or any other personal belonging of said spouses, and signified&nbsp; her willingness to turn&nbsp; over&nbsp; to&nbsp; the administrator the silverwares mentioned in&nbsp; Paragraph&nbsp; III of the project of partition, which were the only property in her care, on the date that she would expect&nbsp; the delivery to her of her share in the inheritance from&nbsp; her deceased&nbsp; parents.<br><br>On July 6, 1950, Juan&nbsp; de Borja and&nbsp; his sisters Marcela, Saturnina,&nbsp; Eufracia, Jacoba and Olimpia, all&nbsp; surnamed de Borja, as heirs of Quintín de Borja, filed a motion for the delivery to them of&nbsp; their&nbsp; inheritance&nbsp; in the&nbsp; estate, tendering&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; a&nbsp; document&nbsp; ceding&nbsp; and transferring to the latter all the rights, interests and participation of Quintín de&nbsp; Borja in Civil Case No. 7190 of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Nueva Ecija,&nbsp; pursuant to the provisions&nbsp; of the Project of Partition, and expressing their willingness to put&nbsp; up a bond if required to&nbsp; do so by the Court,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 18, 1950,&nbsp; the Court ordered the administrator to deliver to Marcela, Juan, Saturnina, Eufracia, Jacoba and Olimpia, all surnamed de Borja, all the properties&nbsp; adjudicated to them&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Project of Partition dated February&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1944,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the latter's filing a bond in the sum of&nbsp; P10,000 conditioned upon the payment of such obligation as may be ordered by the Court after a&nbsp; hearing on the controverted accounts of the administrator.&nbsp; The Court considered the&nbsp; fact that the heirs had complied with the requirement imposed by the Project of Partition&nbsp; when they tendered the. document ceding and transferring the rights and interests of Quintín de Borja in the aforementioned lands and expressed the&nbsp; necessity of&nbsp; terminating&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings as&nbsp; soon as practicable, observing that the Estate had been under&nbsp; administration for over twenty-five years already.&nbsp; The Court,&nbsp; however, deferred action on the petition filed by the special administratrix of the Intestate Estate of&nbsp; Juliana de Borja&nbsp; until after compliance with the conditions imposed by&nbsp; the project of partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; But on July 20, 1950, apparently before the properties were delivered&nbsp; to the heirs, Francisco de Borja&nbsp; and Miguel B.&nbsp; Dayco filed a motion&nbsp; informing the Court that the two parcels of land located&nbsp; in Cabanatuan, Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, produced&nbsp; some 21,300 cavans&nbsp; of palay, amounting to P213,000 at P10 per cavan, which were enjoyed by some heirs;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; administrator Crisanto de Borja had not taken possession of the same for circumstances&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; his&nbsp; control; and that there also&nbsp; existed the sum of P70,204 which the former administrator, Quintín de Borja, received from properties that were redeemed, but&nbsp; which amount did not come&nbsp; into the hands&nbsp; of&nbsp; the present administrator because&nbsp; according to reliable information, same was delivered&nbsp; to the&nbsp; heir Juliana&nbsp; de Borja who&nbsp; deposited it in her&nbsp; name at the Philippine National&nbsp; Bank.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was,&nbsp; therefore prayed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; be required&nbsp; to exert the necessary&nbsp; effort&nbsp; to ascertain the identity of the person or persons&nbsp; who were in possession of the&nbsp; same amount and of the value of the products of the lands in&nbsp; Mayapyap,&nbsp; Cabanatuan,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, and to recover the same for the Intestate&nbsp; Estate.<br><br>On July&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; the special&nbsp; administratrix&nbsp; of the estate of Juliana de&nbsp; Borja, then deceased, filed an&nbsp; answer to the motion of these&nbsp; two heirs,&nbsp; denying the&nbsp; allegation that said heir received any product of the lands mentioned from Quintín de Borja,&nbsp; and informed the Court that the Mayapyap&nbsp; property had always&nbsp; been&nbsp; in the&nbsp; possession of Francisco de Borja himself and prayed the Court that the administrator be instructed to demand&nbsp; all the fruits and&nbsp; products of said property from Francisco de Borja.<br><br>On July 28, 1950, the heirs of Quintín&nbsp; de Borja also filed their&nbsp; opposition to&nbsp; the said&nbsp; motion of Francisco&nbsp; de Borja and&nbsp; Miguel B. Dayco on the ground that the petition was superfluous because the&nbsp; present proceeding was only for the approval of the statement of accounts filed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator;&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; improper because it was asking the Court to order the administrator to perform what he was duty bound to&nbsp; do; and that said heirs were already barred or estopped from raising that question in view of their absolute ratification of and assent to the statement of accounts submitted by the administrator.<br><br>On August 16, 1950,&nbsp; by order of the Court, the properties adjudicated to Juliana de&nbsp; Borja in the Project of Partition were finally delivered to the estate of said heir upon the filing of a bond for P20,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that same order, the Court denied the administrator's&nbsp; motion to reconsider the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; July&nbsp; 18, 1950,&nbsp; requiring him&nbsp; to deliver to the heirs of&nbsp; Quintín de&nbsp; Borja the properties&nbsp; corresponding to them,&nbsp; oh the ground that there existed no sufficient reason to disturb said order. It also&nbsp; ruled that as the petition of&nbsp; Francisco de Borja and Miguel B. Dayco made mention&nbsp; of certain properties allegedly belonging to the Intestate, said, petition should properly&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered together with the final accounts of&nbsp; the administrator.<br><br>The administrator raised the&nbsp; matter by certiorari&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Tribunal, which was docketed as G. R. No. L-4179, and on May&nbsp; 30, 1951, We rendered decision affirming the order complained of, finding that the heirs Juan de Borja and&nbsp; sisters have complied with the requirement&nbsp; imposed in the Project of Partition&nbsp; upon the tender of the document of cession of rights and quit-claim executed by Marcela de Borja, the administratrix of the Estate of Quintin de&nbsp; Borja, and&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the reasons advanced by the administrator in opposing the execution of the order of delivery were&nbsp; trivial.<br><br>On August 27, 1951, the administrator filed his&nbsp; amended statement of accounts covering the period from March 1, 1945, to July 31, 1949, which showed a cash&nbsp; balance of P36,660.&nbsp; Ah&nbsp; additional&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of accounts&nbsp; filed&nbsp; on August 31,&nbsp; 1951 for the&nbsp; period of from August 1,&nbsp; 1949, to August 31,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; showed a cash&nbsp; balance&nbsp; of P5,851.17 and pending, obligations in the amount of P6,165.03.<br><br>The heirs of&nbsp; Quintín de Borja again&nbsp; opposed the approval of these statements of accounts charging the administrator&nbsp; with having failed to include the&nbsp; fruits which the estate should have accrued from 1941 to 1951 amounting to P479,429.70,&nbsp; but&nbsp; as the&nbsp; other&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; seemed&nbsp; satisfied with&nbsp; the&nbsp; accounts presented by said&nbsp; administrator and as their group was&nbsp; only one of&nbsp; the&nbsp; 4 heirs&nbsp; of Intestate Estate,&nbsp; they prayed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the administrator be&nbsp; held liable for only P119,932.42 which was % of the amount alleged to have been omitted.&nbsp; On October 4,&nbsp; 1951, the adminis- trator filed a reply to said opposition containing a counter-claim for&nbsp; moral damages against all&nbsp; the heirs&nbsp; of Quintin de Borja&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum of P30,000 which was&nbsp; admitted by the Court over&nbsp; the&nbsp; objection of&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of Quintin&nbsp; de Borja that the&nbsp; said pleading was filed&nbsp; out of time.<br><br>The oppositors, the&nbsp; heirs of&nbsp; Quintin&nbsp; de&nbsp; Borja,&nbsp; then filed their answer to the counterclaim denying the charges therein, but later served&nbsp; interrogatories on the administrator relative&nbsp; to the&nbsp; averments&nbsp; of&nbsp; said counterclaim. Upon receipt of the answer to said interrogatories specifying the acts upon which the claim for&nbsp; moral damages was based, the oppositors filed an amended&nbsp; answer contending that inasmuch&nbsp; as the acts, manifestations and pleadings referred to&nbsp; therein were admittedly&nbsp; committed and prepared by their&nbsp; lawyer, Atty.&nbsp; Amador E. Gomez, same cannot be made the basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; counterclaim, said lawyer not being a party to the action, and furthermore, as the acts upon which the claim for moral damages were based had&nbsp; been committed&nbsp; prior to the&nbsp; effectivity of the new Civil Code, the provisions of said Code on moral damages could not be invoked.&nbsp;&nbsp; On January 15,&nbsp; 1952, the administrator&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; amended&nbsp; counterclaim&nbsp; including&nbsp; the counsel for&nbsp; the&nbsp; expositors as defendant.<br><br>There&nbsp; followed a momentary&nbsp; respite in the proceedings until another judge was assigned to preside over said court to dispose of the&nbsp; old cases pending&nbsp; therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; August 15,&nbsp; 1952, Judge&nbsp; Encarnacion&nbsp; issued an order&nbsp; denying admission to administrator's amended counterclaim directed against the lawyer, Atty. Amador E. Gomez,&nbsp; holding that a lawyer, not being a party to the&nbsp; action, cannot be made answerable&nbsp; for&nbsp; counterclaims.&nbsp; Another order was also issued&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same&nbsp; date&nbsp; dismissing the&nbsp; administrator's counterclaim for&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages&nbsp; against the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of Quintín de Borja&nbsp; and their counsel for the alleged defamatory acts, manifestations&nbsp; and utterances,&nbsp; and&nbsp; stating that granting the same to be meritorious, yet it was&nbsp; a strictly private&nbsp; controversy&nbsp; between said heirs&nbsp; and the administrator which would&nbsp; not in&nbsp; any way&nbsp; affect the interest of the&nbsp; Intestate, and, therefore, not proper in an intestate proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; stressed that to allow the ventilation&nbsp; of&nbsp; such personal controversies would further delay the proceedings in the case which had already lagged&nbsp; for almost 30 years,&nbsp; a situation which the Court would&nbsp; not countenance.<br><br>Having disposed of these pending incidents which arose out of&nbsp; the principal&nbsp; issue,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is,&nbsp; the disputed statement of accounts&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; by the&nbsp; administrator, the&nbsp; Court rendered&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 5, 1952,&nbsp; ordering the administrator to distribute the funds in his possession to the&nbsp; heirs as follows:&nbsp; P1,395.90 to the&nbsp; heirs of&nbsp; Quintín de Borja; P314.99 to Francisco de Borja; P314.99 to the Estate&nbsp; of Juliana de&nbsp; Borja&nbsp; and&nbsp; P314.99 to Miguel&nbsp; B. Dayco, but as the latter still owed&nbsp; the&nbsp; intestate the sum of P900, said heirs was ordered to pay instead the 3 others the sum of P146.05 each.&nbsp; After considering the testimonies of the witnesses presented by both&nbsp; parties and the available records&nbsp; on&nbsp; hand, the&nbsp; Court found&nbsp; the administrator guilty of maladministration&nbsp; and sentenced&nbsp; Crisanto&nbsp; de Borja to&nbsp; pay to the oppositors,&nbsp; the heirs of Quintín&nbsp; de Borja, the sum of P83,337.81, which was 1/4 of the amount which the estate lost, with legal interest from the&nbsp; date of the judgment.&nbsp; On the same day, the Court also issued an order requiring&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator to deliver to the Clerk of that Court PNB&nbsp; Certificate of Deposit No. 211649 for P978.50 which was issued in the name of Quintin de Borja.<br><br>The administrator, Dr. Crisanto de Borja, gave notice to appeal from the lower&nbsp; Court's&nbsp; orders of August 15, 1952, the&nbsp; decision of September 5, 1952, and&nbsp; the order of even&nbsp; date, but when the Record on&nbsp; Appeal was finally approved, the Court&nbsp; ordered the exclusion of the appeal from the order of September 5, 1952, requiring the&nbsp; administrator to&nbsp; deposit&nbsp; the&nbsp; PNB&nbsp; Certificate of&nbsp; Deposit No. 211649 with&nbsp; the Clerk of Court,&nbsp; after the oppositors had shown that during the hearing of that incident, the parties agreed to abide by&nbsp; whatever resolution the&nbsp; Court would make on the ownership of the funds covered by that deposit.<br><br><i>The issues.</i>—Reducing the issues to bare essentials, the questions&nbsp; left for our determination&nbsp; are: (1)&nbsp; whether the counsel for a party in a case may be included as a defend- ant&nbsp; in a&nbsp; counterclaim;&nbsp; (2) whether&nbsp; a claim&nbsp; for moral damages may be entertained in a proceeding for the settlement of an estate;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; what may&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as acts of maladministration and&nbsp; whether&nbsp; an&nbsp; administrator,&nbsp; as the one in the ease&nbsp; at bar, may be held&nbsp; accountable for any&nbsp; loss or&nbsp; damage&nbsp; that the estate&nbsp; under his administration may&nbsp; incur by reason of his negligence, bad faith&nbsp; or acts of maladministration;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (4) in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar has the Intestate or&nbsp; any of the heirs suffered any&nbsp; loss or damage by reason of the administrator's&nbsp; negligence, bad faith or maladministration?&nbsp; If so, what is the amount of such&nbsp; loss&nbsp; or damage?<br><br>I.—Section 1, Rule&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court&nbsp; defines a counterclaim&nbsp; as:<br><blockquote>Section 1, <i>Counterclaim Defined.</i>—A counterclaim is any claim, whether for&nbsp; money or otherwise, <i>which a party may have against t}ie opposing&nbsp; party</i>.&nbsp; A counterclaim need not diminish&nbsp; or defeat the recovery&nbsp; sought hy the opposing party, but may claim relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from&nbsp; that&nbsp; sought by the opposing&nbsp; party's claim.</blockquote>It is&nbsp; an&nbsp; elementary rule of procedure that a counter- claim is a relief available to a party-defendant against the adverse party which may or may not be independent from the&nbsp; main issue.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; controversy&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case at&nbsp; bar, that the acts,&nbsp; manifestations and actuations alleged to be defamatory and upon&nbsp; which the counterclaim was based were&nbsp; done or prepared by counsel for oppositors; and the&nbsp; administrator contends that as&nbsp; the very oppositors manifested that whatever civil liability arising from acts, actuations,&nbsp; pleadings&nbsp; and&nbsp; manifestations attributable to their&nbsp; lawyer is&nbsp; enforceable against&nbsp; said&nbsp; lawyer,&nbsp; the amended counterclaim&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter not in his individual or personal capacity but as counsel for the oppositors.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is his stand, therefore, that the lower court erred in denying admission&nbsp; to&nbsp; said pleading.&nbsp; We differ from the view&nbsp; taken by the administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appearance of&nbsp; a&nbsp; lawyer as counsel for a party and his participation in&nbsp; a case&nbsp; as such&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; does not&nbsp; make&nbsp; him&nbsp; a party to the action.&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; he represents&nbsp; the interests of his client or that he acts in&nbsp; their behalf will not hold him liable for or make&nbsp; him entitled to any award that the Court&nbsp; may adjudicate to the parties, other than his professional fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; principle that a&nbsp; counterclaim cannot be&nbsp; filed&nbsp; against persons&nbsp; who are&nbsp; acting in representation of another—such&nbsp; as&nbsp; trustees—in&nbsp; their&nbsp; individual capacities&nbsp; (Chambers&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Cameron, 2&nbsp; Fed.&nbsp; Rules Service, p. 155; 29 F. Supp. 742) could be applied with more force&nbsp; and effect&nbsp; in the case of a counsel whose participation in the action is&nbsp; merely confined to the preparation of the&nbsp; defense of his&nbsp; client.&nbsp; Appellant, however, asserted that he filed the counterclaim against said lawyer not in his individual&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; but as counsel for&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of Quintín de&nbsp; Borja.&nbsp; But as&nbsp; we have already stated that the existence of a lawyer-client relationship does not make the former&nbsp; a party to&nbsp; the action, even this&nbsp; allegation of appellant will not alter&nbsp; the&nbsp; result We have arrived at.<br><br>Granting&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; lawyer really employed&nbsp; intemperate language in the course&nbsp; of&nbsp; the hearings or in the&nbsp; preparation of the&nbsp; pleadings filed in connection with this case, the remedy against said&nbsp; counsel would be to have&nbsp; him cited for contempt of court or take other administrative measures that&nbsp; may be proper in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case, but&nbsp; certainly not a&nbsp; counterclaim for&nbsp; moral damages.<br><br>II.—Special Proceedings No. 6414&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal (Pasig&nbsp; branch)&nbsp; was&nbsp; instituted for&nbsp; the purpose of&nbsp; settling&nbsp; the Intestate&nbsp; Estate of&nbsp; Marcelo&nbsp; de Borja.&nbsp; In taking cognizance of the case, the Court was clothed with a limited jurisdiction which cannot expand to collateral matters not arising out&nbsp; of or in any way related to the settlement&nbsp; and adjudication of the properties of the&nbsp; deceased, for it&nbsp; is a settled rule that the&nbsp; jurisdiction of a probate court is limited and special&nbsp; (Guzman vs. Anog,&nbsp; 37 Phil. 361).&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is&nbsp; a tendency now to relax this rule and extend the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the probate court in respect to matters incidental and collateral to the exercise of its recognized powers (14 Am. Jur. 251- .252),&nbsp; this should be understood to comprehend only cases related to those powers specifically&nbsp; allowed by the statutes. For it was&nbsp; even&nbsp; said that:<br><blockquote>"Probate&nbsp; proceedings are purely&nbsp; statutory and their functions. limited to the control of&nbsp; the property upon the death of&nbsp; its owner, and&nbsp; cannot extend to the adjudication&nbsp; of&nbsp; collateral&nbsp; questions" (Wossmes, The American Law of&nbsp; Administration, Vol.&nbsp; I, p. 514, 662-663).</blockquote>It was in the acknowledgment of its limited&nbsp; jurisdiction that the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; dismissed the administrator's counterclaim for&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages against the&nbsp; oppositors, particularly against Marcela de Borja&nbsp; who&nbsp; allegedly ut- tered derogatory remarks&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to cast dishonor to said administrator sometime in 1950&nbsp; or 1951, his Honor's ground&nbsp; being that the court exercising limited jurisdiction cannot entertain claims of this&nbsp; kind which should properly belong&nbsp; to a&nbsp; court&nbsp; of general&nbsp; jurisdiction.&nbsp; From whatever angle it may be looked at, a counterclaim for moral damages demanded&nbsp; by an administrator against the heirs for alleged&nbsp; utterances, pleadings and actuations&nbsp; made in the course of&nbsp; the proceeding, is an&nbsp; extraneous matter in a testate or intestate proceedings.&nbsp; The injection into the action of incidental questions entirely foreign&nbsp; in probate proceedings should not be encouraged for to do otherwise would run counter to the clear intention of the&nbsp; law, for it was&nbsp; held that:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; speedy settlement&nbsp; of the estate of&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; persons for the benefit of the creditors and&nbsp; those entitled to the residue by way&nbsp; of inheritance or legacy after the debts aud expenses of administration have been paid, is the ruling spirit of our probate law"&nbsp; (Magbanua vs. Akel,&nbsp; 72 Phil., 667, 40 Off. Gaz., 1871).</blockquote>III. and IV.—This appeal arose from the opposition of the&nbsp; heirs of Quintín de Borja to the approval of the statements of&nbsp; accounts rendered&nbsp; by the&nbsp; administrator of the Intestate Estate of Marcelo de&nbsp; Borja, on the ground&nbsp; that certain&nbsp; fruits which should have accrued to&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate were unaccounted&nbsp; for,&nbsp; which&nbsp; charge&nbsp; the administrator denied.&nbsp; After a protracted and extensive&nbsp; hearing on the matter,&nbsp; the Court, finding the administrator, Dr. Crisanto de Borja,&nbsp; guilty of certain acts&nbsp; of maladministration, held him&nbsp; liable for&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment to the&nbsp; oppositors,&nbsp; the heirs of Quintin de&nbsp; Borja,&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1/4 of the&nbsp; unreported income which the estate should have received.&nbsp; The evidence presented in the court below bear out the following facts;<br><br>(a) The&nbsp; estate owns a 6-door building, Nos. 1541, 1543, 1545,&nbsp; 1547, 1549&nbsp; and 1551 in Azcarraga Street,&nbsp; Manila, situated in front of the Arranque market.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this prop- erty, the administrator&nbsp; reported to have received for the estate the&nbsp; following rentals:<br><br>Total rentals&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Umiual<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="32%"><div align="center">Period of time</div></td><td width="34%"><div align="center">Total rentals </div></td><td width="34%"><div align="center">Unnual monthly rental </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>March to December, 1945.</td><td><div align="right">P3.085.00 </div></td><td><div align="right">P51.42</div></td></tr><tr><td>January to December, 1946</td><td> <div align="right">4,980.00 </div></td><td><div align="right">69.17 </div></td></tr><tr><td>January to December, 1947</td><td><div align="right">8,880.00 </div></td><td><div align="right">115.70 </div></td></tr><tr><td>January to December, 1948</td><td><div align="right">9,000.00 </div></td><td><div align="right">125.00.</div></td></tr><tr><td>January to December, 1949</td><td><div align="right">8,840.00 </div></td><td><div align="right">122.77</div></td></tr><tr><td>January to December, 1950</td><td><div align="right">6,060.00 </div></td><td><div align="right">184.16</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">__________</div></td><td><div align="right"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">Total</div></td><td> <div align="right">P40,295.00</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The oppositors, in disputing&nbsp;

November&nbsp; 15, 1949, he&nbsp; paid&nbsp; a total of&nbsp; P28,200 for&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease&nbsp; of&nbsp; Door&nbsp; No. 1543 and the&nbsp; basement&nbsp; of Door No. 1541.&nbsp; These figures were not&nbsp; controverted&nbsp; or disputed by the administrator but claimed&nbsp; that said tenant subleased the apartments occupied by Pedro Enriquez and Soledad Sodora and paid the said rentals, not to&nbsp; the ad- ministrator,&nbsp; but to said&nbsp; Enriquez.&nbsp; The transcript of the testimony of this&nbsp; witness really bolster this contention— that Lauro&nbsp; Aguila talked with said Pedro&nbsp; Enriquez when he leased&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; apartments&nbsp; and admitted paying the&nbsp; rentals to the&nbsp; latter and not&nbsp; to the administrator.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that&nbsp; Pedro Enriquez&nbsp; is the same person who appeared to be&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator's collector, duly&nbsp; authorized to receive the rentals&nbsp; from this Azcarraga property&nbsp; and for which services, said Enriquez received&nbsp; 5 per&nbsp; cent of the amount he might be able to collect&nbsp; as commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are to believe&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; contention, aside from&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission that&nbsp; Pedro Enriquez received he also sublet the apartments he was occupying&nbsp; at a&nbsp; very much higher rate than that&nbsp; he actually paid the estate without&nbsp; the&nbsp; knowledge of the administrator or with&nbsp; his approval.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; also seemed&nbsp; to possess that peculiar habit of giving little&nbsp; importance&nbsp; to bookkeeping methods, for he never kept a ledger or book of entry for amounts received for the&nbsp; estate, We&nbsp; find no record of the rentals the lessees of the other doors were paying.&nbsp; It was, however,&nbsp; brought about&nbsp; at the hearing that the 6&nbsp; doors&nbsp; of this building are of the same sizes and&nbsp; construction and the lower Court&nbsp; based its computa- tion of the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; this&nbsp; property sliould have, earned for the&nbsp; estate on&nbsp; the rental&nbsp; paid by Atty.&nbsp; Aguila for the 11/2&nbsp; doors that he occupied.&nbsp; We see no&nbsp; excuse why the administrator could&nbsp; not have taken&nbsp; cognizance&nbsp; of&nbsp; these rates and received the same for&nbsp; the&nbsp; benefit of the estate he was administering, considering the fact that he used to make trips&nbsp; to Manila usually once a month and&nbsp; for which he charged to the estate&nbsp; P8 as transportation&nbsp; expenses for every trip.<br><br>Basing on the rentals paid by Atty. Aguila for&nbsp; 1 1/2 doors, the estate would have received P112,800 from February 1, 1945, to November 15, 1949,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; 6 doors, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; Court held him&nbsp; accountable not&nbsp; only&nbsp; for the sum of P34,235 reported for&nbsp; the&nbsp; period ranging from March&nbsp; 1, 1945, to December 31,&nbsp; 1949, but&nbsp; also for a deficit of P90,525 or&nbsp; a total&nbsp; of&nbsp; P124,760.&nbsp;&nbsp; The record shows, however that the upper&nbsp; floor of Door&nbsp; No. 1549 was&nbsp; vacant in September, 1949,&nbsp; and as Atty.&nbsp; Aguila used to pay P390 a month for the use of&nbsp; an entire apartment from September to&nbsp; November,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1949, and&nbsp; he also paid P160&nbsp; for the&nbsp; use of the basement of&nbsp; an&nbsp; apartment (Door No.&nbsp; 1541), the&nbsp; use,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; of said upper&nbsp; floor would cost&nbsp; P230 which should be deducted, even if the computa- tion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lower Court&nbsp; would&nbsp; have to be followed.<br><br>There&nbsp; being&nbsp; no proper evidence to show that the&nbsp; administrator collected more rentals than those&nbsp; reported by him,&nbsp; except in&nbsp; the instance already&nbsp; mentioned, We&nbsp; are reluctant to hold him accountable in the amount for which he was held liable by the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; Court, and We&nbsp; think that&nbsp;&nbsp; under the&nbsp; circumstances it would&nbsp; be&nbsp; more&nbsp; just to add to the sum reported by the administrator as received by him as rents for 1945-1949&nbsp; only, the difference&nbsp; between the sum reported&nbsp; as paid&nbsp; by Atty. Aguila and&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; actually paid by&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; as rents of&nbsp; 11/2&nbsp; the apartments during&nbsp; the said period,&nbsp; or&nbsp; P25,457.09 1/4&nbsp; of which is P6,364.27 which shall be paid to the&nbsp; oppositors.<br><br>The record also shows that in&nbsp; July, 1950, the administrator delivered to the other heirs Doors Nos. 1545,&nbsp; 1547, 1549 and 1551 although Doors Nos. 1541 and 1543&nbsp; adjudicated to the oppositors&nbsp; remained under his&nbsp; administration.&nbsp; For the period from January&nbsp; to&nbsp; June,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; entire property&nbsp; was still administered by him, the administrator reported to have received for the 2 oppositors' apartments for&nbsp; said period of six months&nbsp; at P168.33 a month, the sum of P1,010 which belongs to the oppositors and should&nbsp; be&nbsp; taken from the amount reported by the&nbsp; administrator.<br><br>The lower&nbsp; Court computed at&nbsp; P40&nbsp; a month&nbsp; the&nbsp; pre-war rental admittedly&nbsp; received for every apartment, the income that&nbsp; said property would have earned&nbsp; from 1941 to 1944, or a total of P11,520, but as&nbsp; We have&nbsp; to exclude the.period covered by the Japanese occupation, the estate should receive only <i>P2,880</i> 1/4 of which P720 the&nbsp; administrator should pay to&nbsp; the oppositors for the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1941.<br><br>(b)&nbsp; The Intestate&nbsp; estate also owned a parcel of land in Mayapyap, Nueva Ecija, with an area of 71 hectares, 95 ares and 4 centares,&nbsp; acquired by Quintin de Borja from the spouses Cornelio Sarangaya and Feliciana Mariano in Civil Case No. 6190 of the Court of First Instance of said province. In virtue of the&nbsp; agreement entered into by the heirs,&nbsp; this property&nbsp; was turned&nbsp; over by&nbsp; the estate of Quintín de Borja to the intestate and&nbsp; formed part of the general mass&nbsp; of said estate.&nbsp; The report of the&nbsp; adminis- trator&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to disclose any return from&nbsp; this property alleging, that&nbsp; he had not taken possession of the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; He does not deny however that he knew&nbsp; of the existence of this&nbsp; land but claimed that when he demanded the delivery of the&nbsp; Certificate of Title covering this property, Rogelio Limaco,&nbsp; then&nbsp; administrator of&nbsp; the estate of Quintin&nbsp; de Borja, refused to surrender the same and he did not take any&nbsp; further action to recover the same.<br><br>To counteract the insinuation that the Estate of Quintín de Borja was in possession of this property&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1940 to 1950, the oppositors presented several witnesses, among them was an&nbsp; old man, Narciso Punzal, who testified that he knew both&nbsp; Quintín and Francisco de Borja; that before the war&nbsp; or sometime in 1937, the former administrator of the Intestate, Quintín de Borja, offered him the position of overseer&nbsp; (encargado)&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; land&nbsp; but he&nbsp; was&nbsp; not able to assume the same due to the death of said adminis- trator; that on July 7, 1951, herein appellant.invited him to go to his house in Pateros, Rizal, and while in said house, he was&nbsp; instructed&nbsp; by appellant to testify in court next day that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; overseer of the Mayapyap property for Quintín de Borja from 1937-1944, delivering the yearly proceeds of 1,000 cavanes of palay to Eogelio Limaco;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he did&nbsp; not&nbsp; need to be afraid because both Quintín de Borja and Eogelio Limaco were already dead. Jiut as he knew that the facts on which he was.to testify were false,&nbsp; he went instead to the house&nbsp; of&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the daughters of&nbsp; Quintín&nbsp; de&nbsp; Borja, who, together&nbsp; with&nbsp; her brother,&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Juan de&nbsp; Borja,&nbsp; accompanied&nbsp; him&nbsp; to&nbsp; the house of .the counsel for said oppositors before whom his sworn declaration was taken (Exh. 3).<br><br>Other&nbsp; witnesses, i.e.,&nbsp;&nbsp; Isidro&nbsp; Benuya,&nbsp; Federico&nbsp; Cojo, Emilio de la Cruz and Ernesto. Mangulabnan, testified that they were some of the tenants of the Mayapyap property; that&nbsp; they were paying their&nbsp; shares to&nbsp; the overseers&nbsp; of Franciseo de Borja and sometimes to his wife, which the administrator was not able to contradiet,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; lower. Court found no reason why the&nbsp; administrator would&nbsp; fail to take&nbsp; possession of this property considering&nbsp; that this was&nbsp; even the subject of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; of February 16,&nbsp; 1940, executed by&nbsp; the heirs of the Intestate.<br><br>The lower Court, giving due credence to the testimonies of the witnesses for the oppositors, computed the loss the estate&nbsp; suffered in the form of&nbsp; unreported income from the rice&nbsp; lands for 10 years&nbsp; at&nbsp; P67,000&nbsp; (6,700 a&nbsp; year) and the amount of P4,000 from the remaining portion of the land not devoted&nbsp; to rice cultivation&nbsp; which was being&nbsp; leased at&nbsp; P20 per hectare.&nbsp; Consequently, the Court held the administrator liable to appellees in the sum of <i>P17,750</i> which is&nbsp; 1/4 of the total&nbsp; amount which&nbsp; should&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; accrued to the estate for this item.<br><br>But if We exclude the 3 years of occupation, the income for 7 years would be P46,900 for the ricelands and P2,800 (at P400&nbsp; a year) for the remaining&nbsp; portion not devoted to rice&nbsp; cultivation or a total of P48,700, 1/4 of which is <i>P12,175</i> which We hold&nbsp; the administrator liable to&nbsp; the oppositors.<br><br>(c) The Hacienda Jalajala located in said town of Rizal, was divided into 3 parts: the&nbsp; Punta section belonged to Marcelo de&nbsp; Borja, the Bagombong pertained to&nbsp; Bernardo de Borja and Francisco de Borja got&nbsp; the Jalajala&nbsp; proper. For the purpose&nbsp; of this case, we will just&nbsp; deal with that part called&nbsp; Junta.&nbsp; This properly has an&nbsp; area&nbsp; of 1,345, hectares, 29 ares and 2 centares&nbsp; (Exh. 36) of which, according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; surveyor&nbsp; who&nbsp; measured&nbsp; the same,&nbsp; 200 hectares were of cultivated&nbsp; rice fields and 100&nbsp; hectares dedicated to the planting of&nbsp; upland rice.&nbsp; It has also timberland and forest which produce considerable amount of trees and firewoods.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the said property which has an assessed value of P115,000 and for which the estates&nbsp; pay real estate&nbsp; tax of P1,500&nbsp; annually,&nbsp; the administrator reported the following;<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="16%"><div align="center">Year</div></td><td width="49%"><div align="center">Income</div></td><td width="35%"><div align="center">Expenditures (not including administration's </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1945</div></td><td><div align="right">P625.00</div></td><td><div align="right">P1,310.42</div></td></tr><tr><td height="20"><div align="center">1946</div></td><td><div align="right">1,800.00</div></td><td><div align="right">3,471.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1947</div></td><td><div align="right">2,550.00</div></td><td><div align="right">2,912.91</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1948</div></td><td><div align="right">1,828.00</div></td><td><div align="right">3,311.88</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1949</div></td><td><div align="right">3,204.50</div></td><td><div align="right">4,792.09</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1950</div></td><td><div align="right">2,082.00</div></td><td><div align="right">2,940.91</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">__________</div></td><td><div align="right">__________</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">P12,089.50</div></td><td><div align="right">P18.739.21</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>This statement was assailed by the oppositors and to substantiate&nbsp; their charge that the administrator did not file the true&nbsp; income of the property, they presented several witnesses who testified that there were about 200 tenants working&nbsp; therein; that&nbsp; these&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; Crisanto&nbsp; de Borja rentals at the rate of 6 cavanes of palay per hectare; that&nbsp; in the&nbsp; years&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1948 and 1944,&nbsp; the Japanese&nbsp; were the ones who collected their rentals,&nbsp; and that the estate could have&nbsp; received no&nbsp; less than&nbsp; 1,000&nbsp; cavanes&nbsp; of palay yearly.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the administrator had presented witnesses to refute the facts previously testified to&nbsp; by the witnesses for the oppositors, the Court held that the&nbsp; report of the administrator did not&nbsp; contain the real income of the property devoted to rice cultivation, which was fixed at 1,000 cavanes every year—for 1941, 1942, 1945,&nbsp; 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949&nbsp; and 1950,&nbsp; or a total of&nbsp; 8,000&nbsp; cavanes valued at P78,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as the administrator accounted for the sum of P11,155&nbsp; collected from rice harvests&nbsp; and&nbsp; if&nbsp; to this amount we&nbsp; add&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P8,739.20 for expenses, this will&nbsp; make a total of P19,894.20, thus leaving a deficit of P53,105.80,&nbsp; 1/4&nbsp; of which&nbsp; will&nbsp; be P13,276.45&nbsp; which&nbsp; the administrator is held liable to pay the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quintin do Borja.<br><br>It was also proved during the&nbsp; hearing that the forestland of this property&nbsp; yields considerable amount of&nbsp; marketable firewoods.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking into consideration&nbsp; the testimonies&nbsp; of witnesses for both parties, the&nbsp; Court arrived at the conclusion&nbsp; that the&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; sold&nbsp; to&nbsp; Gregorio&nbsp; Santos firewoods worth&nbsp; P600&nbsp; in 1941, P3,500 in&nbsp; 1945&nbsp; and P4,200 in 1946&nbsp; or&nbsp; a&nbsp; total&nbsp; of&nbsp; P8,300.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the&nbsp; report&nbsp; included only the amount of P625, there was&nbsp; a&nbsp; balance of P7,675 in favor of the estate.&nbsp; The oppositors were not able to present any proof of sales made after these years, if there were&nbsp; any and the&nbsp; administrator was&nbsp; held accountable to the oppositors&nbsp; for only&nbsp; P1,918.75.<br><br>(d) The&nbsp; estate also owned&nbsp; riceflelds in Cainta, Rizal, with&nbsp; a total area of 22 hectares, 76 ares&nbsp; and 66&nbsp; centares. Of&nbsp; this&nbsp; particular&nbsp; item,&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator reported&nbsp; an income&nbsp; of P12,104&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1945&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; The oppositors protested against this report and presented witnesses to disprove the same.<br><br>Basilio Javier worked as a tenant in the land of Juliana de Borja which is near the land belonging to the Intestate, the 2&nbsp; properties being&nbsp; separated&nbsp; only by&nbsp; a&nbsp; river.&nbsp;&nbsp; As tenant of Juliana de Borja, he knew the tenants working on the property&nbsp; and also&nbsp; knows that&nbsp; both lands&nbsp; are of the same class, and that an area accommodating one cavan of seedling's yields&nbsp; at&nbsp; most&nbsp; 100&nbsp; cavanes and&nbsp; 60&nbsp; cavanes at the least.&nbsp; The&nbsp; administrator failed to overcome&nbsp; this testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; lower&nbsp; Court&nbsp; considering the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; testified&nbsp; to by this witness made a finding that the property belonging to this Intestate was actually occupied by several persons accommodating&nbsp; 13% cavanes&nbsp; of&nbsp; seedlings; that as for every&nbsp; cavan of&nbsp; seedlings,&nbsp; the&nbsp; land produces&nbsp; 60 cavanes of palay, the whole&nbsp; area under cultivation&nbsp; would have&nbsp; yielded 810 cavanes a year&nbsp; and under&nbsp; the&nbsp; 50-50 sharing system (which was testified to by witness Javier), the estate should have received no less than 405&nbsp; cavanea every year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, for the period of 7 years—from 1941 to 1950,&nbsp; excluding the 3 years of war—the corresponding earning of the estate should be 2,835 cavanes, out of which the 405 cavanes&nbsp; from the harvest&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1941 is valued at P1,215 and&nbsp; the rest&nbsp; 2,430 cavanes at&nbsp; P10 is valued at P24,300,&nbsp; or&nbsp; all in all P25,515.&nbsp; If&nbsp; from this, amount the reported income&nbsp; of P12,104&nbsp; is deducted, there will be a balance of P13,411.10&nbsp; 1/4 of which or <i>P3,352.75</i>&nbsp; the administrator&nbsp; is held liable to pay to the oppositors.<br><br>(e)&nbsp; The records&nbsp; show that the administrator paid surcharges&nbsp; and penalties&nbsp; with a total of&nbsp; P988.75&nbsp; for&nbsp; his failure to pay on time the taxes imposed on the properties under his administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; He advanced the reason that he lagged in the payment of those tax obligations&nbsp; because of lack of cash balance for the&nbsp; estate.&nbsp; The oppositors, however,&nbsp; presented evidence&nbsp; that&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 29, 1939, the administrator received from&nbsp; Juliana de Borja the sum of P20,475.17 together with certain&nbsp; papers pertaining&nbsp; to the intestate (Exh. 4), aside from the&nbsp; checks in the name of Quintín de&nbsp; Borja.&nbsp; Likewise, for his failure&nbsp; to pay the taxes on&nbsp; the&nbsp; building at Azcarraga for 1947, 1948 and 1949, said property was sold at public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; and the administrator had&nbsp; to&nbsp; redeem the&nbsp; same&nbsp; at P3,295.48,&nbsp; although&nbsp; the amount that should have been paid was only P2,917.26.&nbsp; The estate therefore suffered a loss of&nbsp; <i>P378.22</i>. Attributing these surcharges and penalties to the negligence of the administrator, the lower Court adjudged him liable to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; oppositors&nbsp; 1/4&nbsp; of P1,366.97, the&nbsp; total&nbsp; loss suffered by the Intestate, or&nbsp; P341.74<br><br>(f) Sometime in 1942, a&nbsp; big fire razed&nbsp; numerous houses in Pateros, Rizal, including&nbsp; that of Dr.&nbsp; Crisanto de Borja. Thereafter, he claimed that among the properties burned therein&nbsp; was his safe containing&nbsp; P15,000&nbsp; belonging to the estate under his administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; administrator con- tended that this loss was already proved to the satisfaction of the Court who approved&nbsp; the same by order of&nbsp; January 8, 1943, purportedly&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; Judge Servillano Flaton (Exh. B).&nbsp; The oppositors contested the genuineness of this&nbsp; order and presented&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1950, an expert witness who conducted several tests to determine the probable&nbsp; age of the questioned&nbsp; document, and arrived at the conclusion that the questioned ink writing&nbsp; "(Fdo)" appearing at the bottom of Exhibit B&nbsp; cannot be more than 4 years old&nbsp; (Bxh. 39).&nbsp; However,&nbsp; another expert witness presented&nbsp; by&nbsp; the administrator contradicted&nbsp; this&nbsp; finding and&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; conclusion arrived at by expert witness Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pedro Manzafiares&nbsp; was&nbsp; not supported&nbsp; by authorities and&nbsp; was merely the result of his&nbsp; own theory, as there was no method yet discovered that would determine the&nbsp; age of a&nbsp; document, for&nbsp; every&nbsp; document has its own reaction to different&nbsp; chemicals used&nbsp; in the tests. There is,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; another&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that called the attention of the lower&nbsp; Court:&nbsp; the administrator testified that the money and&nbsp; other papers delivered by Juliana de&nbsp; Borja to him&nbsp; on October 29, 1989,&nbsp; were saved from said fire. The&nbsp; administrator justified the existence of these valuables by asserting that these properties were locked by Juliana de Borja in her drawer in the "casa solariega" in Pateros and hence was not in his&nbsp; safe&nbsp; when&nbsp; his&nbsp; house, together with the safe, was burned.&nbsp; This&nbsp; line of&nbsp; reasoning is really subject&nbsp; to doubt and the lower Court opined, that it runs counter to&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinary course of human behavior for an administrator to leave in the drawer of the "aparador" of Juliana de Borja the money and other documents belonging to&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate under his administration,&nbsp; which delivery has receipted for, rather than&nbsp; to keep&nbsp; it&nbsp; in his safe together&nbsp; with the alleged P15,000&nbsp; also belonging to the Intestate.&nbsp; The&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; orders&nbsp; of Judge&nbsp; Platon also put the defense of appellant to&nbsp; bad&nbsp; light, for on <i>February 6, 1943</i>, the Court required&nbsp; Crisanto de&nbsp; Borja to appear before the&nbsp; Court of examination&nbsp; of the other heirs in connection with the&nbsp; reported loss,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on March 1, 1943, authorized&nbsp; the lawyers for&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; parties to&nbsp; inspect the safe allegedly&nbsp; burned (Exh.&nbsp; 35).&nbsp; It is inconceivable that Judge Platon would still.order the inspection&nbsp; of the safe if&nbsp; there&nbsp; was really an order approving the&nbsp; loss of those P15,000.&nbsp; We must not forget, in this connection, that the records of this case were burned and that at the time of the hearing of&nbsp; this incident in 1951,&nbsp; Judge Platon was already dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower Court also found no reason why the administrator should keep in his possession such amount of money, for ordinary prudence would&nbsp; dictate that as an administration funds that come into his possession in a fiduciary capacity should not&nbsp; be&nbsp; mingled&nbsp; with&nbsp; his&nbsp; personal funds and&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been deposited in the Bank in the name of the intestate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The administrator was held respon- sible for this loss and ordered to pay&nbsp; 1/4 thereof,&nbsp; or the sum of P3,750. <br><br>(g)&nbsp; Unauthorized expenditures—<br><br>1. The&nbsp; report&nbsp; of the administrator&nbsp; contained&nbsp; certain sums amounting to P2,130 paid to and&nbsp; receipted by Juanita V.&nbsp; Jarencio the administrator's&nbsp; wife, as&nbsp; his private secre<br><br>that he needed her services&nbsp; to keep&nbsp; receipts and records' for him, and that he did not secure first the authorization from the court before making these disbursements because it was merely a pure administrative function.<br><br>The keeping, of receipts&nbsp; and retaining in his custody records connected&nbsp; with the&nbsp; management of the properties under&nbsp; administration is a duty that properly belongs to the administrator, necessary to support the statement of accounts that he&nbsp; is obliged to submit to the court for approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever his&nbsp; wife&nbsp; took charge of the safekeeping of these receipts and for which she should be compensated, the same should be taken from his fee.&nbsp; This disbursement was disallowed by the&nbsp; Court for&nbsp; being unauthorized and the administrator required to pay the oppositors 14 thereof or <i>P532.50</i>.<br><br>2. The&nbsp; salaries&nbsp; of Pedro&nbsp; Enriquez, as collector of the Azcarraga property; of Briccio Matienzo and Leoncio Perez, as encargados, and of Vicente Panganiban&nbsp; and Herminigildo Macetas as&nbsp; forest-guards were found&nbsp; justified,&nbsp; although unauthorized,&nbsp; as they appear to be reasonable and necessary for the care and preservation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Intestate.<br><br>3. The&nbsp; lower Court&nbsp; disallowed as&nbsp; unjustified&nbsp; and unnecessary the expenses for salaries paid to special policemen amounting to P1,509.&nbsp; Appellant contended that he sought for&nbsp; the services of Macario Kamungol and others to&nbsp; act as&nbsp; special policemen&nbsp; during harvest time&nbsp; because most of the workers tilling the Punta property were not natives of Jalajala but of the neighboring towns and they were likely&nbsp; to&nbsp; run away with the harvest without giving&nbsp; the share&nbsp; of the estate if they were not policed.&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of reasoning did not appear to be convincing to the trial judge as&nbsp; the cause for such fear seemed to exist only in&nbsp; the imagination.&nbsp; Granting that such kind of situation existed, the&nbsp; proper thing&nbsp; for the administrator to do would have been to secure the previous authorization from the&nbsp; Court if he failed&nbsp; to secure the&nbsp; help&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; local police.&nbsp; He should be held liable for this unauthorized expenditure and pay the heirs of Quintin&nbsp; de Borja 1/4, thereof or <i>P377.25</i>.<br><br>4. From the year 1942&nbsp; when his house was burned,&nbsp; the administrator and&nbsp; his&nbsp; family took shelter at the&nbsp; house belonging to the Intestate&nbsp; known as "casa solariega" which, in the Project of Partition, was adjudicated to his father, Francisco&nbsp; de Borja.&nbsp; This&nbsp; property, however, remained under his administration and for its repairs he spent from 1945-1950, P1,465.14, duly&nbsp; receipted.<br><br>None of these repairs&nbsp; appear to be&nbsp; extraordinary&nbsp; for the receipts were for nipa,&nbsp; for carpenters and thatchers. Although it is true that Rule 85, Section 2 provides that:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>EXECUTOR&nbsp; OR ADMINISTRATOR TO KEEP BUILDINGS IN REPAIR.</i>—An&nbsp; executor&nbsp; or administrator shall maintain in tenantable repair the&nbsp; houses and other&nbsp; structures and fences belonging to the estate, and deliver the&nbsp; same&nbsp; in such&nbsp; repair to the heirs or devisees when directed&nbsp; so to do by the court. </blockquote>yet considering that during his occupancy of&nbsp; the said "casa solariega" he was&nbsp; not paying any rental at&nbsp; all,&nbsp; it is but reasonable that&nbsp; he&nbsp; should take care of the expenses for the ordinary repair of said house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant asserted that had he&nbsp; and his family not occupied&nbsp; the&nbsp; same, they would have to pay someone to watch and take care of said house.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this will not excuse him from this responsibility for the disbursements he made&nbsp; in connection with the aforementioned&nbsp; repairs&nbsp; because even if&nbsp; he stayed in another house, he would&nbsp; have had to pay rentals or else take charge also of expenses for the repairs of his residence. The&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; should be held liable to the oppositors in the amount of. <i>P366.28.</i><br><br>5.&nbsp; Appellant reported to have incurred expenses amount- ing; to P6,304.75 for alleged repairs&nbsp; on the rice mill&nbsp; in Pateros, also belonging to the&nbsp; Intestate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of&nbsp; the disbursements made therein, the items corresponding, to Exhibits&nbsp; I, 1-1,&nbsp; 1-21, L-26, L-15,&nbsp; L-64 and L-65, in the total sum of P570.70 were rejected by the&nbsp; lower court on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; they&nbsp; were all&nbsp; unsigned although&nbsp; some were&nbsp; dated. The lower&nbsp; Court, however, made an oversight in including the sum of f 150 covered by Exhibit L-26 which was duly&nbsp; signed&nbsp; by Claudio Reyes because this does not refer to the repair of the rice-mill but for the roofing of the house and&nbsp;&nbsp; another&nbsp;&nbsp; building&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; allowed.&nbsp; Consequently, the sum of P570.70 shall&nbsp; be reduced&nbsp; to P420.70 which added to the sum of P3,059 representing expenditures rejected as unauthorized to wit:&nbsp;

statement of&nbsp; accounts,&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; reported&nbsp; to&nbsp; have&nbsp; incurred a&nbsp; total expense&nbsp; of&nbsp; P5,977 for the planting of the ricefields in&nbsp; Cainta,&nbsp; Rizal, from the agricultural year 1945-46 to 1950-51.&nbsp; It was proved that the prevailing&nbsp; sharing system in&nbsp; this part of the country was&nbsp; on&nbsp; 50-50 basis.&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; admitted that expenses for planting were advanced&nbsp; by the estate and liquidated after each harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; report, except for the&nbsp; agricultural year 1950 contained nothing of the payments that the tenants should have&nbsp; made.&nbsp; If the total expenses for said&nbsp; planting&nbsp; amounted&nbsp; to P5,977, 1/2&nbsp; thereof or P2,988.50 should have been paid&nbsp; by the tenants as their share of such expenditures, and as P965 was reported&nbsp; by the&nbsp; ad- ministrator&nbsp; as paid back in&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; there&nbsp; still&nbsp; remains a balance of P2,023.50 unaccounted for.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this shortage, the administrator is responsible&nbsp; and should pay the&nbsp; oppositors 1/4&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; or <i>P505.87</i>.<br><br>7.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; transportation expenses&nbsp; of&nbsp; the administra- tor:—It appears that from&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1945&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1951, the administrator charged the estate with a total of P5,170 for transportation expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; unreceipted&nbsp; disbursements were correspondingly itemized, a typical example of which is as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="3"><div align="center">"1950 "Gastoa die viuje del ado'dnistrador "From Pateros </div></td></tr><tr><td width="54%">&nbsp;</td><td width="21%"> <div align="right">60 X P4.00 .</div></td><td width="25%"><div align="right">= P200.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>"To Pasig</td><td><div align="right">50 x P10.00</div></td><td><div align="right">= P500.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>"To Manila</td><td><div align="right">8 x F8.00</div></td><td><div align="right">= P64.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>"To Cainta </td><td><div align="right">P 5 x 35.00</div></td><td><div align="right">= <span style="text-decoration: underline;">P175.00</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>"To Jalajala </td><td><div align="right"></div></td><td><div align="right"></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">P989.00"</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><p align="center">(Exhibit WV-B4)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>From the report of the administrator, We are being made to believe that the Intestate estate is a losing proposition and assuming <i>arguendo</i> that this is true, that precarious financial condition which he, as administrator,&nbsp; should know, did&nbsp; not&nbsp; deter Crisanto&nbsp; de Borja&nbsp; from charging to the depleted&nbsp; funds of&nbsp; the estate comparatively&nbsp; big&nbsp; amounts for his transportation expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; tried to justify these charges by contending that he used&nbsp; his own car&nbsp; in making those trips to Manila,&nbsp; Pasig&nbsp; and&nbsp; Cainta and&nbsp; a launch in visiting the properties in Jalajala, and they were for&nbsp; the&nbsp; gasoline&nbsp; consumed.&nbsp; This&nbsp; rather&nbsp; unreasonable spending of the estate's fund prompted the Court to observe that one&nbsp; will have to spend only P0.40 for transportation in making a trip from Pateros to Manila&nbsp; and practically the&nbsp; same amount&nbsp; in going to Pasig.&nbsp; From his report for 1949&nbsp; alone, appellant made a total of 97 trips to these places or an average of one trip for&nbsp; every&nbsp; 3 1/2 days.&nbsp; Yet We must not forget that&nbsp; it was during this&nbsp; period that the administrator failed&nbsp; or refused to&nbsp; take cognizance of the prevailing rentals of commercial&nbsp; places in&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; that caused certain&nbsp; loss to the&nbsp; estate and for&nbsp; which he was accordingly&nbsp; held responsible.&nbsp; For the reason that the alleged disbursements made for transportation expenses cannot be said to.be economical,&nbsp; the lower Court held that the administrator should be held liable to the oppositors for 14 thereof or the sum, of P1,292.50, though We think that this&nbsp; sum&nbsp; should still be reduced&nbsp; to&nbsp; <i>P500</i>.<br><br>8. Other expenses:<br><br>The administrator also&nbsp; ordered 40 booklets of&nbsp; printed contracts&nbsp; of&nbsp; lease in the name of the Hacienda&nbsp; Jalajala which cost P150.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; said <i>hacienda</i> was divided into 3 parts, one belonging to this Intestate and the other two parts to&nbsp; Francisco, de Borja and Bernardo&nbsp; do Borja,&nbsp; ordinarily&nbsp; the&nbsp; Intestate&nbsp; should only&nbsp; shoulder 1/3&nbsp;&nbsp; the said expense, but as the tenants who testified during&nbsp; the hearing of the matter&nbsp; testified that those printed forms were not being used, the Court adjudged the administrator personally responsible for this amount.&nbsp; The&nbsp; records&nbsp; reveal,&nbsp; however, that this printed form was not&nbsp; utilized because the tenants&nbsp; refused to sign any, and We can presume that when the administrator ordered for the printing of the same,&nbsp; he did not foresee&nbsp; this situation. As there is&nbsp; no showing&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; printed&nbsp; contracts were used&nbsp; by another and&nbsp; that they&nbsp; are still&nbsp; in the possession of the administrator which could&nbsp; be&nbsp; utilized&nbsp; anytime, this&nbsp; disbursement may be allowed.<br><br>The report also contains a receipt of payment made to Mr. Severo Abellera in the sum of P375&nbsp; for his transportation&nbsp; expenses as one of&nbsp; the two commissioners who prepared&nbsp; the Project of&nbsp; Partition,&nbsp; The opposiiors were able to prove that on May 24,&nbsp; 1941,&nbsp; the Court authorized the administrator to withdraw&nbsp; from' the&nbsp; funds&nbsp; of the Intestate&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P300 to defray&nbsp; the transportation expenses of the commissioners. The administrator, however,&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; that he used this&nbsp; amount for the&nbsp; payment of certain&nbsp; fees&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with the approval of the proposed&nbsp; plan of the&nbsp; Azcarraga&nbsp; property which was then&nbsp; being processed in the City&nbsp; Engineer's&nbsp; Office. From that testimony, it would seem that appellant could even&nbsp; go&nbsp; to the&nbsp; extent&nbsp; of disobeying the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court specifying for what purpose that amount should be appropriated and took upon himself the task of judging for what it will serve best.&nbsp; Since he was not able to show or prove&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; money&nbsp; intended&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordered by the Court to be paid for the transportation&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; of the commissioners was&nbsp; spent for the benefit&nbsp; of the estate as claimed, the administrator should be held responsible therefor&nbsp; and 'pay to the oppositors 1/4 of P375 or the sum of <i>P93.75.</i><br><br>The records reveal that for the service of summons to the&nbsp; defendants in Civil Case No. 84 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, P104 was paid to the Provincial Sheriff of the same province (Exhibit H-7).&nbsp; However, an item <b>for P40 appeared to have been paid to the Chief of Police</b> of Jalajala allegedly for the service of the same summons. Appellant&nbsp; claimed that as the defendants in said case lived in remote&nbsp; barrios,&nbsp; the services of the Chief of Police as delegate or agent of the Provincial Sheriff were necessary. He forgot&nbsp; probably the fact that local chiefs of police are deputy sheriffs <i>ex-officio</i>.&nbsp; The administrator was therefore ordered by the&nbsp; lower Court to&nbsp; pay 1/4 of&nbsp; said amount or P10&nbsp; to&nbsp; the oppositors.<br><br>The administrator included in his&nbsp; Report the sum of P550 paid to Atty.&nbsp; Filamor for his&nbsp; professional services&nbsp; rendered for the defense of the administrator in G. R. No. L-4179, which was&nbsp; decided against him, with costs.&nbsp; The lower Court disallowed&nbsp; this disbursement on the ground&nbsp; that this&nbsp; Court provided that the&nbsp; coats of that litigation&nbsp; should not be borne by the estate but by the administrator&nbsp; himself, personally.<br><br>Costs of a litigation&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; taxed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Clerk of Court,&nbsp; after a verified petition has been filed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; prevailing party,&nbsp; shall be awarded to said party&nbsp; and&nbsp; will only include his fee and that of&nbsp; his attorney for&nbsp; their appearance which shall not be more than P40; expenses for the printing and the copies of the record&nbsp; on appeal; all lawful charges imposed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clerk of Court;&nbsp; fees for the taking&nbsp; of depositions&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; expenses connected with the appearance of witnesses or for lawful fees of a commissioner (De la&nbsp; Cruz, Philippine Supreme Court&nbsp; Practice,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 70-71).&nbsp;&nbsp; If the costs provided for in that case, which this Court ordered to&nbsp; be&nbsp; chargeable personally against the administrator are not recoverable by the latter,&nbsp; with more&nbsp; reason&nbsp; this item&nbsp; could&nbsp; not be charged against&nbsp; the&nbsp; Intestate.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; the administrator should&nbsp; pay the oppositors&nbsp; 14&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P550&nbsp; or <i>P137.50</i>.<br><br>(e)&nbsp; The lower Court in its decision required appellant to pay the oppositors the sum of&nbsp; PI,395 out&nbsp; of the funds still in the possession of the administrator.<br><br>In the statement of accounts submitted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the administrator,&nbsp; there appeared&nbsp; a&nbsp; cash balance&nbsp; of&nbsp; P5,851.17 as of August 31, 1951.&nbsp; From this amount, the sum of P1,002.96 representing&nbsp; the&nbsp; Certificate of&nbsp; Deposit.&nbsp; No. 21619&nbsp; and Check&nbsp; No. 57338,&nbsp; both of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank and in the name of Quintín de Borja, was deducted leaving a&nbsp; balance&nbsp; of P4,848.&nbsp; As Judge Zulueta ordered&nbsp; the delivery&nbsp; to the&nbsp; oppositors of the amount of P1,890 in his order&nbsp; of October 8, 1951; the delivery of the amount of P810 to the&nbsp; estate of&nbsp; Juliana&nbsp; de Borja&nbsp; in&nbsp; his order of October 23, 1951,&nbsp; and the sum of P932.32&nbsp; to&nbsp; the game estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Juliana&nbsp; de Borja by&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of February 29, 1952, or a total of P3,632.32 after deducting the same from&nbsp; the cash&nbsp; in&nbsp; the possession of the administrator, there will only be&nbsp; a&nbsp; remainder&nbsp; of&nbsp; P134.98.<br><br>The Intestate is also the&nbsp; creditor of Miguel B. Dayco, heir and administrator of the estate of Crisanta de Borja, in the&nbsp; sum of P900&nbsp; (Exhibits S&nbsp; and S-l).&nbsp; Adding this credit&nbsp; to the&nbsp; actual&nbsp; cash&nbsp; on hand, there will be a total of P1,034.98, 1/4 of which or P258.74 properly belongs to the oppositors.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; as there&nbsp; is only&nbsp; a residue of P134.98 in the hands of the administrator and dividing it among the 3 groups of heirs who are not indebted to the Intestate,&nbsp; each&nbsp; group will&nbsp; receive P44.99, and Miguel B. Dayco is&nbsp; under obligation to reimburse P213.76&nbsp; to&nbsp; each of them.<br><br>The lower Court ordered&nbsp; the administrator&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver to the oppositors the amount of P1,395.90 and P314.99 each to Francisco de Borja and the estate of Juliana de Borja, but as We have arrived at the computation that the three heirs&nbsp; not indebted to the Intestate ought to receive P44.99 each&nbsp; out&nbsp; of the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P134.98, the&nbsp; oppositors&nbsp; are entitled to the sura of P1,080.91—the amount deducted from them&nbsp; as taxes&nbsp; but which the&nbsp; Court ordered to be returned to them—plus P44.99 or a total of Pl,125.90.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appearing, however, that in a Joint Motion dated November 27, 1952,&nbsp; duly approved by the&nbsp; Court, the parties&nbsp; agreed to fix the amount at P1,125.58,&nbsp; as the&nbsp; amount due and said heirs&nbsp; have already received this amount in satisfaction of this item,&nbsp; no&nbsp; other sum can be&nbsp; chargeable against&nbsp; the administrator.<br><br>(f)&nbsp; The probate Court&nbsp; also ordered the administrator to render an accounting of his&nbsp; administration during the Japanese occupation on the ground that although appellant maintained&nbsp; that whatever&nbsp; money&nbsp; he received during that period is worthless, same having been declared without any value, yet during the early years&nbsp; of the war, or during 1942-43, the Philippine peso was still in&nbsp; circulation,&nbsp; and articles of prime necessity as&nbsp; rice and firewood commanded high&nbsp; prices and were paid with jewels or&nbsp; other valuables.<br><br>But We must not forget that in his order of December 11, 1945, Judge Peña required the administrator to render an accounting&nbsp; of&nbsp; his administration only&nbsp; from March 1, 1945,&nbsp; to&nbsp; December&nbsp; of the same year&nbsp; without ordering said&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; to&nbsp; ihelude&nbsp; therein&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; occupation period.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Court below&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; the condition&nbsp;&nbsp; then&nbsp; prevailing during&nbsp; the war-years, We&nbsp; cannot simply&nbsp; presume,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence of&nbsp; proof to that effect,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the administrator received such valuables or properties for the&nbsp; use or in exchange&nbsp; of&nbsp; any asset or produce of the Intestate, and in view of the aforementioned order of Judge&nbsp; Peña,&nbsp; which We find no reason to disturb, We see no practical reason for requiring appellant to account for those&nbsp; occupation years when&nbsp; everything was affected by&nbsp; the abnormal&nbsp; conditions created&nbsp; by the&nbsp; war.&nbsp; The records of the Philippine National Bank show that there was a current account jointly in&nbsp; the&nbsp; names of Crisanto de Borja and&nbsp; Juanita V. Jarencio, his wife, with a balance of P36,750.35&nbsp; in Japanese military notes and&nbsp; admittedly belonging to the Intestate&nbsp; and We do not believe that the oppositors or&nbsp; any of the heirs would be interested in an accounting for the purpose of dividing&nbsp; or distributing this deposit.<br><br>(g)&nbsp; On&nbsp; the sum of P13,294 for administrator's&nbsp; fees: It is&nbsp; not disputed&nbsp; that the administrator set aside for himself and collected from the estate the sum&nbsp; of P13,294 as his fees from&nbsp; 1945 to 1951&nbsp; at the rate of P2,400 a year.&nbsp; There is also no controversy as to the fact that this appropriated amount was taken without the order or previous approval by&nbsp; the probate Court.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; is there any&nbsp; doubt that the administration of the Intestate estate by Crisanto de Borja is far from satisfactory.<br><br>Yet&nbsp; it is a fact that Crisanto de Borja&nbsp; exercised the functions&nbsp; of an administrator and is&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; also to a certain&nbsp; amount as compensation for the work and services he has&nbsp; rendered as&nbsp; such.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; extent and&nbsp; size of the estate, the amount involved and the nature of the properties&nbsp; under administration, the amount collected by&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator for his compensation at P200 a&nbsp; month&nbsp; is&nbsp; not unreasonable&nbsp; and&nbsp; should&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore be allowed.<br><br>It might be argued against this disbursement that the records are&nbsp; replete&nbsp; with&nbsp; instances&nbsp; of&nbsp; highly irregular practices&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrator,&nbsp; such&nbsp;&nbsp; as the&nbsp; pretended ignorance of the necessity of a book&nbsp; or ledger&nbsp; or at least a list&nbsp; of&nbsp; chronological&nbsp; and&nbsp; dated&nbsp; entries&nbsp; of&nbsp; money or produce the Intestate acquired&nbsp; and the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; disbursements made for the same properties; that admittedly he did not have&nbsp; even a list of&nbsp; the&nbsp; names&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lessees to&nbsp; the properties under&nbsp; his&nbsp; administration,&nbsp; nor even a list of those who owed back rentals,&nbsp; and although&nbsp; We certainly agree with the probate Court in&nbsp; finding appellant&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of maladministration,&nbsp; specifically in mixing the&nbsp; funds of the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; under his administration with&nbsp; his personal funds&nbsp; instead&nbsp; of keeping a current account for&nbsp; the Intestate in his capacity as&nbsp; administrator, We are of the opinion that despite&nbsp; these irregular practices for which he was held already liable and made in some&nbsp; instances to reimburse&nbsp; the&nbsp; Intestate for&nbsp; amounts that&nbsp; were not properly accounted for, his claim&nbsp; for compensation&nbsp; as&nbsp; administrator's fees shall be as&nbsp; they&nbsp; are hereby allowed.<br><br><i>Recapitulation.</i>—Taking all the&nbsp; matters threshed herein&nbsp; together, the administrator is held liable to pay to the heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quintin de&nbsp; Borja the&nbsp; following:<br><br>Under&nbsp; Paragraphs III and IV:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="15%">(a)</td><td width="17%">&nbsp;</td><td width="15%">&nbsp;</td><td width="53%"> <div align="right">P7.084.27</div></td></tr><tr><td>(b)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">12,175.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>(c)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">16,113.95 </div></td></tr><tr><td>(d)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">3,352.75</div></td></tr><tr><td>(e)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">341.74</div></td></tr><tr><td>(f)</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">3,760.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>(g)</td><td> 1</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">532.50</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2 </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">377.26 </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>4</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">366.28</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>5</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">869.92</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>6</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">505.87</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>7</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">500.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>8</td><td>-a</td><td><div align="right"></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>b</td><td><div align="right">93.75</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td> c</td><td><div align="right">10.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>d.</td><td><div align="right">137.50 </div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right">__________</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="right">P46.210.78</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the foregoing, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from is modified by&nbsp; reducing the amount&nbsp; that the administrator was sentenced to pay the oppositors to the&nbsp; sum of P46,210.78&nbsp; (instead of P83,337.31), plus legal interests on this amount from the date of the decision&nbsp; appealed from, which is hereby&nbsp; affirmed in all other&nbsp; respects.&nbsp; Without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
