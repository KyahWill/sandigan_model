				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This suit  to  collect  eleven checks  totalling  P4,290.00 is here for decision because it involves no issue of fact.</p>
<p>Such checks  payable  to  "cash or  bearer", and drawn.. by  defendant Tan Kim  (the  other  defendant is  her husband) upon  the Equitable Banking Corporation, were  all        presented for payment by  Chan Wan to the drawee bank, but  they "were all dishonored and returned to  him  unpaid due to  insufficient  funds and/or causes attributable to the drawer."</p>
<p>At the hearing of the case, in  the Manila court of first instance,  the plaintiff  did not take the  witness stand. His  attorney,  however,  testified  only  to identify  the checks—which are Exhibits  A to K—plus  the letters  of demand upon defendants.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tan Kim  declared  without contradiction that  the checks had been issued  to two  persons named Pinong  and Muy for  some shoes  the former had promised to  make and  "were intended as mere  receipts".</p>
<p>In view of  such circumstances,  the court  declined  to order payment for two principal reasons:  (a)  plaintiff failed to prove he was a holder  in due course, and (b) the  checks  being  crossed  checks shoud <em>not</em> have been presented to the drawee for "payment," but should have been deposited instead  with the  bank mentioned in the crossing.</p>
<p>It may be  stated in this connection, that  defendants asserted a counterclaim, the court dismissed it for failure of proof,  and  from such dismissal they did  not  appeal. The only issue is, therefore, the plaintiff's right to collect on the eleven commercial documents.</p>
<p>The Negotiable Instruments Law regulating the issuance of negotiable checks, the rights  and the liabilities  arising therefrom, does not mention "crossed checks". Art. 541 of the  Code of Commerce refers to such  instruments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The bills of Exchange Act of England of 1882, contains several provisions about them, some of which  are quoted in  the  margin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In  Philippine  National  Bank  vs. Zulueta, 101 Phil., 1071; 55 Off. Gaz., 222,  we applied  some provisions "of said  Bills of  Exchange Act because the Negotiable Instruments Law, originating  from England and codified in the United States, permits resort thereto in matters not covered by it and local legislation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>Eight of the checks here in question  bear across their face two parallel transverse lines between which  these words  are written:  non-negotiable—China Banking  Corporation.  These  checks  have,  therefore,  been  crossed specially to the China  Banking  Corporation,  and should have been  presented for payment 4by China Banking, and not by Chan Wan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Inasmuch as Chan Wan  did  present them for payment himself—the Manila court  said—there was no proper presentment, and the liability did not attach to the  drawer.</p>
<p>We agree to the legal premises and conclusion.  It must be remembered, at this point, that the  drawer in drawing the  check engaged that <em>"on due presentment,</em> the check would be paid,  and that if it be dishonored * * * he will pay the amount thereof to the holder".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Wherefore, in the absence  of <em>due presentment,</em> the drawer did not become liable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless we find,  on the backs  of the  cheeks, endorsements which  apparently show they had been deposited with  the China"  Banking  Corporation and were,  by the latter, presented .to the drawee bank for collection.  For instance, on the back of the check Exhibit A  (same as in Exh.  B), this endorsement appears:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"For deposit to the account of White House Shoe Supply with tiie China Banking Corporation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Cleared through the clearing office Central Bank of the Philippines.   All prior endorsements and/or lack of  endorsements guaranteed. China Banking Corporation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the back of Exh. G:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"For deposit to the credit of our account.  Viuda e Hijos de Chua Chiang Pio People's  Shoe Company",</p>
</blockquote>
<p>followed  by  the endorsement of  China Banking  Corporation as in Exhibits A and B.   All the crossed checks have  the "clearance" endorsement of  China Banking Corporation.</p>
<p>These circumstances  would seem  to show deposit of the checks with China Banking  Corporation and subsequent presentation  by the latter through  the clearing office; but as drawee  had no  funds, they were unpaid  and returned,  some of them  stamped  "account' closed".   How they  reached his hands, plaintiff did not indicate.   Most probably, as the trial court surmised,—this is not a finding of fact—he got them <em>after  they had been thus</em> returned,  because he presented them  in court with  such "account closed" stamps, without bothering  to  explain. Naturally and rightly,  the lower court held him not to be a  holder  in due course under the circumstances,  since he knew, upon taking them up,  that the checks had  already been dishonored.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p>Yet it does not follow as a legal proposition, that simply because he was not a holder in due course, Chan  Wan could not recover on the  checks.   The Negotiable  Instruments Law does not provide that a holder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> who is not a holder in due course, may not in any case, recover on the instrument.  If B purchases an overdue negotiable promissory note signed by A, he  is  not  a holder in  due course; but he may  recover from A,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> if the latter has no valid excuse for  refusing payment.  The only disadvan- tage of a holder who is not  a holder in due course is that the  negotiable instrument is subject to'defenses1 as if  it were non-negotiable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p>
<p>Now what defenses did the defendant Tan  Kim prove? The lower court's decision does not mention any; evidently His Honor had in mind  the defense pleaded in defendant's ¦ answer, but thought it unnecessary to specify, because the "crossing" and  presentation  incidents  sufficed to bar recovery, in his opinion.</p>
<p>Tan  Kim  admitted  on cross-examination  either that the checks had been issued as evidence of debts to Pinong and Muy,  and/or that they had been  issued  in payment of shoes  which Pinong  had promised  to make  for her.</p>
<p>Seeming to imply  that Pinong had failed to make  the shoes, she asserted  Pinong  had  "promised  to  pay  the checks for me".   Yet she did not complete the idea, perhaps because she  was. just answering cross-questions,  her main testimony having  referred merely to their  counter-claim. </p>
<p>Needless to say,  if it were true that the  checks had been issued in payment for shoes that were never  made and delivered,  Tan Kim would  have a  good defense  as against a holder who is not a holder in due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p>
<p>Considering  the  deficiency of important  details  on which a fair adjudication of the parties' rights depends, we think the record should be and is hereby returned, in the interest of justice, to the  court below  for additional evidence, and  such further proceedings as are  not  inconsistent with this opinion.   With the understanding that, as defendants did  not appeal,  their counterclaim must be and is hereby definitely  dismissed.  So ordered.</p>
