				<H3>PHILIPPINE  NATIONAL BANK, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DALMACIO CATIPON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal is taken from the&nbsp; decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in its Civil Case No. 15711 sentencing Dalmacio&nbsp; Catipon&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank the principal sum of P3,050.83 with interest thereon from September 1, 1951&nbsp; until full payment&nbsp; plus costs. The facts are set forth in the judgment appealed from to be as follows:<br><blockquote>"The parties stipulate, among other things, that defendant affixed his&nbsp; signature on the Trust Receipt, Exhibit "A" because&nbsp; of his strong desire to get the onions purchased by him from J. V. Ramirez &amp; Co., Inc., and which were&nbsp; duly paid&nbsp; for to said J.&nbsp; V. Ramirez &amp;. Co., Inc., and&nbsp; not to plaintiff Bank, as evidenced by receipts marked Exhibits 1, 2&nbsp; and 3;&nbsp; that his signature&nbsp; was&nbsp; affixed&nbsp; at the Divisoria Market when a son&nbsp; of&nbsp; J. V. Ramirez&nbsp; came- to him&nbsp; and&nbsp; explained that&nbsp; the only way to&nbsp; get onions which he bought&nbsp; was&nbsp; to&nbsp; sign the said&nbsp; Trust Receipt Exhibit&nbsp; "A"; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; signature of&nbsp; Dalmacio Catipon&nbsp; (defendant) was affixed long after the trust receipt Exhibit A was signed by .1. V. Ramirez; that J. V. Ramirez, who is the President and General Manager of J. V. Ramirez &amp; Co., Inc., is the indentor and importer and that Dalmacio Catipon is only a customer of J. V. Ramirez &amp; Co., Inc.;&nbsp; that&nbsp; "plaintiff filed&nbsp; a claim&nbsp; against J. V. Ramirez in the Insolvency&nbsp; Proceedings of J. V. Ramirez &amp; Co., Inc.&nbsp; (Civil Case No. 3191 of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila) long&nbsp; before the present complaint was filed";&nbsp; and that "plaintiff did not&nbsp; realize&nbsp; any&nbsp; cent out of its claim&nbsp; filed in the insolvency proceedings as J. V. Ramirez &amp; Co.&nbsp; has no sufficient assets&nbsp; to meet all claims&nbsp; of&nbsp; the creditors&nbsp; including that of the&nbsp; plaintiff."&nbsp; (Rec. App. pp. 92-93.)<br></blockquote>It is also of record&nbsp; that at&nbsp; the instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bank, Catipon was charged with estafa (Criminal Case No. 8190) for having misappropriated, misapplied and converted the merchandise covered&nbsp; by the trust receipt; but after&nbsp; due trial was acquitted from the charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the bank commenced the present action to recover the value of the goods.<br><br>Dalmacio&nbsp; Catipon&nbsp; rests&nbsp; Ms&nbsp; present&nbsp; appeal on&nbsp; three points,&nbsp; the same ones invoked by him in the court below. They are:&nbsp; (1) That his acquittal in&nbsp; the estafa case is a bar to the Bank's&nbsp; instituting the present&nbsp; civil&nbsp; action, because the Bank did not reserve in the criminal case its right to separately enforce the civil liability of the appellant; (2) That under the facts&nbsp; stipulated, the&nbsp; defendant was not liable^under the trust receipt;&nbsp; and (S) That if at all, he should be held liable only for one-half of the value of the&nbsp; goods&nbsp; under trust, there&nbsp; being&nbsp; no stipulation that he would be solidarily liable with his&nbsp; co-signer.<br><br>We agree with the trial court that the appellant's case has&nbsp; no&nbsp; merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision acquitting appellant Catipon of the charge of <i>estafa</i> does&nbsp; not&nbsp; preclude or bar the filing of this&nbsp; action to enforce his liability as one of the signers of the trust receipt Exhibit "A", for several reasons:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) Because the acquittal was predicated on the conclusion "that the guilt of the defendant, Dalmacio&nbsp; Catipon has not&nbsp; been <i>satisfactorily</i>&nbsp; established",&nbsp; as expressly recited by the&nbsp; decision of acquittal of Judge&nbsp; Alejandro Banlilio Exhibit 4-<i>b</i>, p. 4) and this&nbsp; acquittal being equivalent to one on reasonable doubt, does not'preclude a suit to enforce the&nbsp; civil liability&nbsp; for the same&nbsp; act or omission, under Article&nbsp; 29 of the new Civil&nbsp; Code; it does not finally determine nor expressly declare that the fact from which the&nbsp; civil action might&nbsp; arise&nbsp; did not&nbsp; exist&nbsp; (Rule&nbsp; 107, section&nbsp; 1 [<i>d</i>]) ;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) Because the declaration in the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; acquittal to the effect that "if any responsibility was incurred by the&nbsp; accused—that is&nbsp; civil in nature&nbsp;&nbsp; and not&nbsp; criminal" amounts to a reservation of the&nbsp; civil&nbsp; action&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of tne&nbsp; offended party, for&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; in its decision had no reason&nbsp; to&nbsp; dwell on&nbsp; a civil&nbsp; liability&nbsp; that it intended to extinguish&nbsp; by the same decision;&nbsp; and<br><br>(<i>c</i>) Because if the appellant executed the trust receipt (that the present action seeks to enforce),, he is liable <span style="font-style: italic;">ex contractu</span> for its breach, whether he did or he did not "misappropriate,&nbsp; misapply or convert the said&nbsp; merchandise" as&nbsp; charged&nbsp; in the&nbsp; information&nbsp; filed in the criminal case.<br><br>The second issue raised by appellant is likewise unmeritorious.&nbsp; Whether or not Catipon appended&nbsp; his signature to the trust receipts at the request of the son of his cosigner J. V. Ramirez, and regardless&nbsp; of the arrangements between them,&nbsp; the fact remains that&nbsp; by signing the trust receipt the&nbsp; appellant caused the Bank to believe he assumed the obligations&nbsp; thereunder together with his co-signer;and the Bank having acted on that assumption, induced by the appellant, Catipon, the latter cannot, in equity,&nbsp; be heard now to deny his liability, under the well&nbsp; known principle of&nbsp; estoppel.&nbsp; There is no finding&nbsp; that the Bank was not warned, or had reason to believe that the&nbsp; appellant, in signing the trust&nbsp; receipt, nevertheless did not intend to be bound by its terms, or that there were&nbsp; special arrangements between Ramirez and the appellant.<br><br>As to the third defense, it appearing from the stipulation that the merchandise (onions) covered by&nbsp; the trust receipt were delivered&nbsp; by Ramirez to&nbsp; the,appellant herein, who disposed thereof, it is&nbsp; but right that&nbsp; he should be the one to,&nbsp; answer for their&nbsp; value. Appellant's payments to Ramirez can not diminish the rights of the Bank, since the trust receipt expressly obligated herein .appellant to pa&nbsp; the Bank and not to his co-signer. <br><br>The decision&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed, without prejudice to the appellant's&nbsp; rights against his co-signer J, V. Ramirez &amp; Co., Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista, Angela, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
