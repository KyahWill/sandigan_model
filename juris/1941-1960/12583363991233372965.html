				<H3>ERLINDA STERNBERG AND LUZ STERNBERG, THE LATTER REPRESENTED BY HER  GUARDIAN AD LITEM ANTONIO  STERNBERG, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES,  VS. GONZALO SOLOMON, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action for the foreclosure of  a real  estate mortgage constituted on August 7, 1944, by  defendant Gonzalo  Solomon, in favor  of plaintiffs  Erlinda  Sternberg and Luz Sternberg, to guarantee the payment to each of them  of P3,000, Philippine  currency, or the total sum of P6,000,  Philippine currency, one  (1)  year from said date,  extendible for another year, with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent per annum.  Plaintiffs  alleged in their complaint—filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila, in which the  mortgage property is  situated— that defendant has failed to pay said debt, despite repeated demands by the  former and  repeated promises  of the latter, for which  reason it is prayed that judgment  be rendered against said defendant for the principal of said obligation  and  the interest thereon, and, in the event of failure to pay the same, that the mortgage be foreclosed. <br><br>In his answer, defendant admitted the indebtedness above referred  to, as well as the real  estate mortgage constituted to secure its  satisfaction, and alleged that non-payment thereof  is  due  to plaintiff's demand that settlement  be made in  Philippine currency on a peso-to-peso basis, notwithstanding the fact that the principal of the indebtedness was  received by him in Japanese military  notes, and that he  is bound  to pay  only its equivalent in  Philippine currency pursuant to the  Ballantyne Schedule of Values. Defendant prayed, therefore,  that judgment be rendered only  for the equivalent,  in Philippine currency, of said sum  of  P6,000, in Japanese  military  notes, as  may  be determined by the court. <br><br>Maintaining that this answer raises merely a  question of law,  plaintiffs, thereupon, moved for  a  judgment on the pleadings, which  was  not objected to by the  defendant.   Later on, both  parties filed their  respective memoranda, after which the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision sentencing the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of  P6,000, Philippine  currency, without interest, and without  any pronouncement as to costs.   Defendant  has  appealed  from  this decision  and  he  now maintains that: <br><blockquote>"1.  The lower court erred in refusing  to apply the Ballantyne Scale  of Values to defendant-appellant's wartime obligation. <br><br>"2.  The lower court erred in finding judgment for the plaintiffs-appellees  and against the defendant-appellant for the sum of P6,000, Philippine currency, considering that the  obligation was P6,000 in Japanese  war notes." </blockquote>Appellant's pretense  is untenable.  We  have repeatedly held  that obligations  contracted  during the Japanese occupation and  payable  only  after liberation become  due and  payable  in Philippine currency on the peso-to-peso basis  (Wilson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Berkenkotter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  49  Off. Gaz., 1401).  In the case at  bar,  the  deed of mortgage  in question  dated August  7,  1944, provides, not only  that the obligation guaranteed  thereby  shall be paid "one year  from  date thereof", or  on  August 7,  1945, and,  hence,  after the liberation of Manila,  which took place in February of that year,  but, also:<br><blockquote>"That  strict  compliance  is the essence and nature of this agreement  and as such this mortgage shall be paid <span style="font-style: italic;">one year from date</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">hereof</span> as provided above and expressly agreed <span style="font-style: italic;">not  sooner;</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">or upon the expiration of the time extension  if so extended.</span>"  (Italics ours.) </blockquote>In other  words, it was expressly agreed upon that plaintiff's debt could not be paid before August 7, 1945.  Since Manila  was liberated several months before that date,  it follows  that,  in  line  with the view consistently  adhered to by this  Court (Rono <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Gomez <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 46 Off.
