				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal&nbsp; by certiorari from a decision of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp; declaring intervenor-appellee therein Ignacio de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Cruz, owner of&nbsp; the two parcels of&nbsp; land subject&nbsp; of the&nbsp; action, with the&nbsp; obligation of paying&nbsp; petitioner Feliciano Martin a redemption price of P600,&nbsp; and ordering&nbsp; Feliciano Martin to&nbsp; deliver the&nbsp; lands to&nbsp; said intervenor-appellee upon payment by&nbsp; the latter of the said sum of&nbsp; P600.<br><br>The facts found by the Court&nbsp; of Appeals are as follows: On&nbsp; September 12, 1919 Jose Balagui and Dorotea Balagui, brother and sister,&nbsp; sold the&nbsp; two parcels of land subject of the action, to Feliciano Martin and Florentino Martin for P1,200.&nbsp; On April 17, 1923, Jose Balagui brought an action in the Justice&nbsp; of the Peace Court of Solsona, Ilocos Norte, against said Feliciano and Florentino Martin for damages arising from failure&nbsp; of the Martins to comply with some conditions agreed upon in the sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; The said action was terminated by a compromise agreement between Feliciano&nbsp; Martin, Florentino&nbsp; Martin and&nbsp; Isidro Martin, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; one hand, and&nbsp; the above-named&nbsp; spouses, on&nbsp; the other,&nbsp; who were plaintiffs,&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; to and approved by the court.&nbsp; The agreement is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Presentes en la Corte&nbsp; las partes&nbsp; despues de llamada. la Causa Civil arriba titulada, pidieron&nbsp; que&nbsp; se terminase&nbsp; al&nbsp; asunto&nbsp; para evitar mayores gastos y las molestias&nbsp; consiguientes entre una y otra parte,&nbsp; mediante&nbsp; transaccion de&nbsp; dicho&nbsp; asunto&nbsp; en los&nbsp; siguientes terminos:<br><br>"Primero: Las partes&nbsp; se convienen&nbsp; en dejar sin efecto ni valor en jmcio o fuera de el la escritura publica otorgada en 12 de Septiembre de 1919 par Jose Balagui demandante y la difunta Dorotea Balagui, madre de&nbsp; la dicha demandante Sixta&nbsp; Lantada a favor&nbsp; de los demandados&nbsp; Florentino Martin y Feliciano Martin, sobre venta de dos parcelas de terrenos ubicados en Buguiata del termino Municipal de Piddig&nbsp; en la cantidad&nbsp; de P1,200.00.<br><br>"Segundo:&nbsp; que en la&nbsp; escritura que&nbsp; se otorgara de confonnidad con la extencion del terreno que resulte de su medicon&nbsp; con levantamiento de croquis para mayor inteligencia de vendedores y&nbsp; compradores, ha de constarse&nbsp; como uno de los compradores, Isidro Martin en higar de Florentino Martin, por no ser este el duefio de&nbsp; los 600.00 mitad del&nbsp; precio.<br><br>"Tercero: En el entre&nbsp; tanto, eft terreno de Buguiata que se&nbsp; corn- pone de&nbsp; semerttera huerta y&nbsp; cogohal y de un solo lote y no de dos erroneamente&nbsp; consignados en ella estara a disposicion&nbsp; de los de- mandados&nbsp; Feliciano Martin y de Isidro Martin, para&nbsp; que se aprovechen&nbsp; de sus frutos por la cantidad de&nbsp; P1,200.00 sin&nbsp; transmitir definitivamente los demandados el dominio, corriendo&nbsp; a&nbsp; cuenta de Jose Balagui ios derechos del otogamiento de la nueva escritura. "El juzgado no encontrando motivos para no aprobar las&nbsp; estipulaciones arriba mencionadas las apruebas y&nbsp; queda terminada la Causa sin pronunciamiento en cuento al pago de costas."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals, notwithstanding&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim of Feliciano Martin that he&nbsp; had not&nbsp; known of such agreement and did not sign&nbsp; it,&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; Feliciano Martin did in&nbsp; fact&nbsp; sign&nbsp; the agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court&nbsp; also found that&nbsp; the intention&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; execution of the compromise&nbsp; set&nbsp; forth&nbsp; above, was&nbsp; to transform the original sale made in favor&nbsp; of Feliciano and Florentino Martin on September 12, 1919, into an equitable mortgage, as&nbsp; contended by the&nbsp; spouses and their transferees,&nbsp; the defendant Prudencio Martin and&nbsp; intervenor Ignacio de la Cruz.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court also found that on January&nbsp; 8, 1946, Jose&nbsp; Balagui sold&nbsp; the&nbsp; parcels of&nbsp; land in&nbsp; question to Ignacio de la Cruz for the sum of P2,500, with the understanding&nbsp; that the purchaser&nbsp; would redeem the lands from Feliciano&nbsp; Martin and Florentino&nbsp; Martin by paying to them the sum of P1,200.<br><br>On the basis of the above&nbsp; findings the Court of Appeals reversed&nbsp; the decision of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Ilocos&nbsp; Norte&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; had&nbsp; declared the&nbsp; compromise&nbsp;&nbsp; null and void&nbsp; for having&nbsp; been made before&nbsp; a court which had no competent jurisdiction over the action. <br><br>The decision of the Court of Appeals is now the subject of this appeal by certiorari before this Court, petitioner contending that&nbsp; the Court of Appeals erred&nbsp; in declaring that&nbsp; the&nbsp; compromise&nbsp; had&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect of&nbsp; converting the previous&nbsp; contract&nbsp; of sale into one of loan secured&nbsp; by a mortgage; and on failing to make a finding on the rights and obligations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioner,&nbsp; with&nbsp; respect to the houses builts on the lands in good faith by the petitioner Feliciano&nbsp; Martin&nbsp; and&nbsp; his&nbsp; son-in-law and his daughter. According to the evidence, the house of Feliciano Martin was valued&nbsp; at P3,000, and that of&nbsp; his&nbsp; son-in-law&nbsp; and daughter,&nbsp; P2,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court of Appeals is&nbsp; also alleged to have made an error in&nbsp; declaring that the compromise was valid even&nbsp; if the court&nbsp; before&nbsp; which it was&nbsp; made had no jurisdiction over the&nbsp; case brought and in which it was entered into.<br><br>We cannot reverse&nbsp; or modify the conclusion made by the Court of Appeals that petitioner&nbsp; Feliciano Martin had actually signed the compromise agreement, this being a finding of fact, which is final&nbsp; and&nbsp; binding upon&nbsp; us. It is apparent also that the conclusion&nbsp; to the effect that the validity of the compromise does not depend upon the question of whether or not the justice of&nbsp; the peace court before whom it&nbsp; was made had jurisdiction over the&nbsp; main case, is correct,&nbsp; it being a fact that the parties to the compromise agreement&nbsp; signed&nbsp; and&nbsp; executed the&nbsp;&nbsp; same willingly and voluntarily, and should,&nbsp; therefore, be bound by its terms.&nbsp; A person cannot repudiate the effects of his voluntary acts simply because it does not fit him, or simply because&nbsp; the judge before whom he executed the act did not have jurisdiction of the case.&nbsp; In a regime of law and order, repudiation of an agreement validly entered into can not be made without any ground or reason in law or in fact for such repudiation.&nbsp; The&nbsp; conclusion of the trial court in respect to the&nbsp; validity of the compromise agreement&nbsp; and its binding effect upon Feliciano&nbsp; Martin cannot be questioned.<br><br>The last&nbsp; question raised by the petitioner refers to. the failure of the Court of Appeals to pass upon the respective rights of the intervenor-appellant, respondent herein, and the plaintiff,&nbsp; petitioner herein,&nbsp; and&nbsp; his&nbsp; son-in-law&nbsp; and daughter, with respect to the&nbsp; houses that the&nbsp; latter had built on the lands in question.&nbsp; There is no claim nor even a suggestion that the building of the houses had&nbsp; been made by Feliciano Martin and his son-in-law and daughter in bad faith.&nbsp; That said two buildings actually exist and that one of them is valued at P3,000 and the other, at P2,000, is not denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals is silent on the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the said houses.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find merit in the contention that the Court of Appeals&nbsp; erred in failing to&nbsp; make a specific pronouncement on the rights and obligations&nbsp; of the parties&nbsp; with respect to the said houses.<br><br>The Court&nbsp; of Appeals found that the houses&nbsp; were built after October 31, 1930, after Feliciano Martin had returned the amount of P600 that Florentino Martin had contributed to the purchase money.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the time of the construction, therefore, the petitioner had already become the rightful possessor of the land, having,&nbsp; besides, declared them for tax purposes.&nbsp; No claim is made by any of the parties- respondents that the construction of&nbsp; the houses had been made in&nbsp; bad faith.&nbsp; The compromise agreement did not specify within what period of&nbsp; time Feliciano Martin was to enjoy&nbsp; the possession and&nbsp; use of the lands in question. Neither has there been&nbsp; any evidence submitted to show that&nbsp; the building&nbsp; of the houses was&nbsp; prohibited&nbsp; by the original&nbsp; owners&nbsp; of the land or&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; subsequent purchaser.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; portion of the land was residential,&nbsp; so its use could only be enjoyed by the building of a house thereon. So we must find as a fact that the building of the houses was made in good faith and&nbsp; in the exercise of&nbsp; the rights granted to Feliciano Martin by&nbsp; the compromise agreement. The&nbsp; law applicable to&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 361 of&nbsp; the Spanish Civil Code, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 361.&nbsp; The owner of land on which anything has been built, sown, or planted, in good faith, shall be entitled to appropriate the thing so built, sown, or planted, upon paying the indemnification mentioned in Articles 453 and 454, or to compel the person who has built or planted to pay him the value of the land, and the person who sowed thereon to pay the proper rent therefor."<br></blockquote>We, therefore,&nbsp; agree with the petitioner that the Court of Appeals erred&nbsp; in not having made an express provision as to the houses&nbsp; in question and in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; the above-quoted&nbsp; provision of the&nbsp; Civil Code the intervenor Ignacio de la Cruz, who had become the owner by purchase of the lands in question,&nbsp; should be&nbsp; given, as he is hereby given, the choice either to pay for the&nbsp; value of the houses, or require&nbsp; the petitioner herein&nbsp; to pay for the value of the land.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found that the value of the houses constructed about 29 years ago, were P3,000 and&nbsp; P2,000. We take judicial notice of the fact that the&nbsp; said houses must have&nbsp; depreciated.&nbsp; On the other hand, we can also take&nbsp; judicial notice of&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; the value&nbsp; of real estate has&nbsp; greatly increased&nbsp; since&nbsp; 29 years ago.&nbsp; As&nbsp; no evidence&nbsp; was submitted as to the actual value of the said houses, it seems&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is only just that said values&nbsp; be previously determined before the choice for the purchase thereof by the owner&nbsp; of the land, the intervenor-appellee, can be exercised by the latter.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals is hereby affirmed in&nbsp; the sense that the&nbsp; intervenor-appellee Ignacio&nbsp; de la Cruz is declared to be the owner of&nbsp; the lands subjects of&nbsp; the&nbsp; action and entitled to the possession thereof&nbsp; upon&nbsp; payment by him of the sum of P600&nbsp; to petitioner Feliciano Martin, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; is modified by further ordering&nbsp; that the&nbsp; case be&nbsp; remanded to&nbsp; the court below for determination&nbsp; of the price or the&nbsp; value of the two&nbsp; houses built on the lands in question, and thereafter for the intervenor-appellee to exercise the option specified in Article 361 of the Spanish Civil Code.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
