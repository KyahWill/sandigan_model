				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition  for  review of a decision rendered  by the Auditor General. <br><br>Flaviano Bautista  was an Auditor in the  General Auditing  Office who was  "automatically  and  compulsorily retired on  June 16, 1952, at the  age of 65 years, 5 months and 21  days  with a  creditable   service of  46 years,  6 months and 2  days."   He chose  to receive  a  lump  sum payment  of the present value of his annuity for  the first five years, as provided for in article II,  section  11,  paragraph  (a), No. 3, of Commonwealth  Act No. 186,  as amended  by Republic Act No. 660, the law in force at the time he was retired.   The  Government  Service Insurance System paid  to the  petitioner  the  sum of  P14,853.61, based upon the  following computation:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="81%">Amount&nbsp; of annuity, 1st 5&nbsp; years ..............................................................&nbsp; </td><td colspan="2">P18,007.80 </td></tr><tr><td>Less: Discount at&nbsp; 6% per annum, compounded annually&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td width="1%">&nbsp;</td><td width="18%"><u>2,060,75</u></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Present&nbsp; value of annuity,&nbsp; 1st 5 years ......................................................&nbsp; </td><td colspan="2">P5,947.05 </td></tr><tr><td>Less: Premium account ..........................................................................&nbsp;&nbsp; </td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><u>1,093.44</u></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Net annuity paid.....................................................................................&nbsp; </td><td colspan="2">P14,853.61</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The petitioner objected  to  the  deduction of  the sum  of P2,060.75  and requested that the same  be paid to him, invoking the rule laid down in Espejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Auditor General, 51 Off.  Gaz. 2862; 97  Phil., 216.  The System  denied his request  for the following reasons:<br><blockquote>* * *  In advancing to you your first 5 years  annuity under the said Act which, otherwise would have been paid  to you monthly for  60 months, the System  paid to you only the  "present value" of said first  5 years annuity.  This  is pursuant to section 11 (a), paragraph  (3) of  C. A. No. 186, as inserted by  section 8 of R. A. No.  660, which  was the law then in force on the date of  your retirement, which  reads: <br><br>"(3) For those who are  at least sixty-five years of age, lump sum payment  of present value of annuity for first five years and future annuity to be paid monthly; or...."  (Italics supplied.) <br><br>The term "present  value" as  used  in the law  has  a technical meaning.  It is  that  amount which,  if  invested  now to earn  a fixed rate of interest, will be equivalent to a specified  amount  due on a specific  date in the future.   In other  words, to pay  the present value of the  annuity for first 5 years  is synonymous to discounting said annuity.  In computing  the present value of  annuity under C. A.  No. 186,  as  amended, the System, pursuant  to section 17(d)  thereof, is authorized  to charge interest  at the rate of 5% per  annum,  compounded annually, as was  done in your case. <br><br>With the enactment of R.A. No.  728, which was made effective on June  18, 1952,  section 11 (a), paragraph  (3)  above-quoted, was amended  to read: <br><br>"(3) For those who are at least sixty-five years of age, lump sura payment  of present value of annuity for first five years and future annuity to be paid monthly: Provided, however,  That there shall be no discount from the annuity for the first five years  of those who  are sixty-five years of age or over on the date of approval of Republic Act Numbered Six hundred sixty." <br><br>Even granting, therefore, for the sake of argument that  this law has  retroactive effect, still you are not  covered  by the exemption thereunder as to be paid  in lump  sum the annuity for first 5 years without discount inasmuch as you did not attain  the  age of 65 years on  June 16,  1951, the date of approval of R. A. No.  660, your date  of  birth being December 25, 1886.  This  provision was again further amended on  June  16, 1954 by R.A. No.  1123, in which the law now stands as  was originally enacted.   (Annex C.)</blockquote>He appealed to  the Auditor  General.   The latter   upheld the decision of the System.   Hence this petition. <br><br>A similar question  was passed upon by  this  Court in Espejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Auditor General, supra, in favor of the retired employee.   This  Court saidâ€” <br><blockquote>The last issue posed by petitioner-appellant is whether the Government  Service Insurance  System had  the  right "to subject the lump payment of the  first five years of his gratuity to a  discount of 5 per cent compounded  annually,  amounting  in  this   case to P1,436.18  The appellee Auditor General  defends the action of the Insurance  System  by invoking Section  11 (a)  (3), Republic Act No.  728,  amendatory  to Commonwealth Act  186  and  Republic Act  No. 660, to the  effect that  employees retiring  are  entitled; <br><br>"(3)  For those  who are  at least sixty-five years of age, lump sum payment of present value of annuity for first five years and future annuity to be paid monthly: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however,</span>  That there shall be no discount from the annuity for the first five  years of those who are sixty-five years of age or over on the date of  approval of Republic Act Numbered Six Hundred sixty".</blockquote>and it  is not denied that when Republic Act 660 was approved on  June  16,  1951,  petitioner Espejo was  not yet 65 years old.<br><blockquote>It is  a  fact, however,  that  Espejo  did reach  the age   of compulsory retirement before Republic Act 728 was enacted,  and that at such  time, Republic  Act 660  merely provided for lump sum payment of the annuity for the first five years, without any mention whatsoever of discounts.  When the retirement rights of petitioner became vested, therefore, he became entitled  to a full payment of the  first  five years of his  annuity,  and the proviso inserted by Republic Act  No. 728 (restricting no discount privileges) could not operate retroactively to the prejudice of the vested rights of petitioner herein. Hence, this appeal from the order imposing the discount should be sustained.</blockquote>There is no cogent reason for abandoning the foregoing rule.  Republic  Act  No. 660, which  took  effect on 16 June 1951, amending Commonwealth Act No. 186, the law in force at the time the petitioner was automatically and compulsorily retired on 16 June 1952, establishes a retirement system for officers and employees  of the Government, "designed  primarily  to  provide for  old age  and  disability." <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>  It sets the optional retirement age at 57 years provided the retiring  officer or employee has  rendered thirty years of service, and the automatic and compulsory retirement age at 65 years provided  the retiring  officer or employee has  rendered  fifteen  years  of  service.   To those who are automatically and compulsorily retired the law grants the choice of receiving  a  lump sum payment of the present value  of  their annuity for  the  first five years or an annuity to be paid monthly. The law grants this  benefit only to those  who are automatically and compulsorily retired, because one who reaches that age is generally disabled and approaching the end of his natural life. If he is disabled or sick, he needs medical care and attention.  Unlike an officer or employee who is  a member of the System and retires at 57 years,  he may no longer engage in another occupation to supplement  his  income that has been greatly reduced by his retirement,  since the monthly annuity  a retired officer or  employee gets is much lower than  the  monthly salary he used to receive. It is during these remaining days that  the  law grants to a retired officer or employee a  substantial sum which he may spend for his  sustenance.  To  adopt the respondents'  reasoning and allow the deduction  made from the petitioner's lump sum annuity for the first five years would run counter to the spirit of the law. <br><br>Moreover,  the term "present value"  is used  in its ordinary and not in its technical and restrictive sense.  Furthermore,  in the subsequent  amendatory acts, Republic Act  No. 1123, approved  on 16 June 1954, and Republic Act  No. 1573,  approved on 16  June  1956,  the proviso in Republic  Act No. 728 relied  upon by the respondents has  been stricken out, thereby removing whatever doubt there might  have been in the intent and meaning of the term "present value" of the  lump sum annuity for the first five years to which the  petitioner is  entitled.  The striking out  of such proviso only means  that no  such deduction may be made. Finally, Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended,  has been enacted for the  benefit of the officer or employee and all  doubts as to the intent of the law should be resolved in his favor.<br><br>The  decision of  the  Auditor  General  under review, sustaining  that of the General Manager of the Government Service Insurance System, is reversed, and the latter ordered to pay to the petitioner the sum of P2,060.75, without pronouncement as  to  costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
