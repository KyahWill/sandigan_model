				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondents Urbano Jaca, Bonifacio Jaca and Go Bian Ling were charged by the petitioners before the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Davao with a violation of the Anti-Dummy Law, C.&nbsp; A.&nbsp; No. 108 as amended, in relation to Sections 1 and 5&nbsp; of Article 13 of the Constitution.&nbsp; At the initial stages of the trial, the petitioner tried to prove that during the years 1949-1955,&nbsp; said respondents were members of the partnership Victor Erickson and Company which did business under the trade name of Mindanao Hardwood Lumber Company and&nbsp; of which, respondent Go Bian Ling, an alien, was the manager; that said lumber company was engaged in the manufacture of&nbsp; lumber from the forest or timber&nbsp; concession of respondent&nbsp; Urbano Jaca; that during the years 1949-1950 the production of said company in the form of third and fourth class lumber amounted to about&nbsp; 150,000&nbsp; board feet monthly,&nbsp; which was sold to a firm known as Mindanao Commercial Company&nbsp; at P0.11&nbsp; per board&nbsp; foot, or seven centavos lower than the prevailing price in the open market.&nbsp; Nicolas Santos, an accountant of&nbsp; Sta. Clara&nbsp; Lumber Company, testified that, during the years 1949-1950, lumber was sold in Davao&nbsp; City at P0.16 per board&nbsp; foot for rough lumber and P0.18 per board foot for planed lumber.&nbsp; Fidel Reyes testified on direct examination&nbsp; that&nbsp; Sta. Clara Lumber Company&nbsp; had an&nbsp; office&nbsp; in Davao&nbsp; City engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the manufacture&nbsp; of plywood products&nbsp; and that&nbsp; during&nbsp; the period from September, 1952, to May, 1955, the logs used by said office were supplied by Mindanao Hardwood Company.&nbsp; Reyes was then&nbsp; asked by the prosecution the&nbsp; following question: <br><blockquote>"Q.&nbsp; Regarding the value of&nbsp; the logs delivered by a Mindanao Hardwood Lumber Company thru Mr. Go Bian Ling, did you&nbsp; look into the records of your office (Sta. Clara Lumber Company) ?"<br></blockquote>Respondent Judge <i>motu proprio</i> rejected the question&nbsp; on the ground that "the amount of the transactions is&nbsp; not necessarily to be&nbsp; proved&nbsp; further&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; this case." The other respondents interposed an objection to the same question because&nbsp; it tended to establish an&nbsp; offense&nbsp; not alleged in the information.&nbsp; As all other questions aiming to show that the value of the logs delivered by Mindanao Hardwood Lumber Company to Sta. Clara Lumber Company was&nbsp; paid&nbsp; to Mindanao&nbsp; Commercial&nbsp; Company, of which Mindanao Hardwood Lumber Company is a dummy or front, were disallowed by respondent court, the present petition for certiorari was filed by the Fiscal. <br><br>To test the validity of respondent court's&nbsp; ruling on the exclusion and inadmissibility of the evidence in question, we&nbsp; must&nbsp; examine the act or acts&nbsp; punishable under the law with which the other respondents were charged in the information. <br><br>Section 2-a of C. A. No. 108, as amended, In relation to Sections 1 and 5 of Article 13 of the Constitution, enumerates four ways by which said law is violated,&nbsp; namely: <br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; permits or allows&nbsp; the use exploitations or enjoyment thereof by a person,&nbsp; corporation or&nbsp; association not&nbsp; possessing the requisites prescribed by the Constitution or laws of the Philippines; <br><br>(2)&nbsp; lease, or in any other way, transfers or conveys said rights, franchise, privilege, property or business to a person, corporation or association&nbsp; not&nbsp; otherwise qualified under the Constitution, or the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the existing laws; <br><br>(3)&nbsp; in any manner permits or allows any person, not possessing the&nbsp; qualifications required by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; or existing laws to&nbsp; acquire,&nbsp; use,&nbsp; exploit&nbsp; or&nbsp; enjoy&nbsp; a right, franchise,&nbsp; privilege, property or business, the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; and&nbsp; enjoyment of which are expressly reserved by the Constitution or existing laws to citizens of the Philippines or of any&nbsp; other specific country, to intervene in the management, operation, administration or control&nbsp; thereof, whether&nbsp; as an&nbsp; officer, employee or laborer therein with or without remuneration except&nbsp; technical personnel whose&nbsp; employment may be specifically authorized&nbsp; by the President of the Philippines upon recommendation of&nbsp; the Department&nbsp; Head concerned, if any; <br><br>(4) any person&nbsp; who. knowingly aids,&nbsp; assists,&nbsp; or abets in the planning, consummation&nbsp; or perpetration&nbsp; of any of&nbsp; the acts herein above&nbsp; enumerated.<br></blockquote>The information on the other hand&nbsp; sets&nbsp; forth the following allegations:<br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; on or&nbsp; about&nbsp; the period comprised between July&nbsp; 30, 1949 and May 27,&nbsp; 1956, in the City of Davao and in the Municipality of Panabo, Province of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the&nbsp; said&nbsp; accused Urbano Jaca and&nbsp; Bonifacio Jaca, Filipino citizens, conspiring and confederating together with their co-accused Go&nbsp; Bian Ling alias&nbsp; Si Lam, a Chinese citizen, did then and there&nbsp; voluntarily, maliciously and criminally permit and allow an alien, namely the accused aforesaid Go Bian Ling alias Si Lam, to intervene in the management and operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the business of developing and&nbsp; exploiting a timberland&nbsp; forest,&nbsp; which said Go Bian Ling actually operated and developed in an area partly located at Davao City and partly&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipality&nbsp; of Panabo of this&nbsp; Province,&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the following&nbsp; manner, to wit: that the accused Urbano Jaca, having previously obtained an Ordinary Timber License to develop and exploit&nbsp; the said area entered on June 30, 1949 into&nbsp; a partnership&nbsp; with his&nbsp; co-accused Bonifacio Jaca and&nbsp; Go Bian Ling&nbsp; alias Si&nbsp; Lam to engage in&nbsp; the manufacture&nbsp; of&nbsp; lumber&nbsp; and solicit&nbsp; forest concessions&nbsp; from&nbsp; the government which&nbsp; was&nbsp; capitalized&nbsp; at&nbsp; P16,000.00,&nbsp; the partners contributing thereto&nbsp; share and share&nbsp; alike, and immediately&nbsp; thereafter&nbsp; accused&nbsp; Urbana Jaca&nbsp; delivered and conveyed to the said partnership of which accused Go Bian Ling alias Si&nbsp; Lam was and still&nbsp; is the manager,&nbsp; and thus making&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; actually&nbsp; the manager in the development and exploitation of the&nbsp; same."<br></blockquote>The foregoing information charges&nbsp; only one offense, a violation of Commonwealth Act No. 108, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Dummy Law, committed through the manner&nbsp; prescribed in&nbsp; sub-paragraph&nbsp; 3 of Section 2-A.<br><br>We are of the&nbsp; opinion and&nbsp; so hold that&nbsp; the aforesaid question disallowed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; respondent Judge&nbsp; is relevant to the issue of "management and operation of the business of&nbsp; developing&nbsp; and&nbsp; exploiting a timberland&nbsp; forest,"&nbsp; of which respondent&nbsp; Go Bian Ling&nbsp; was alleged to have&nbsp; been permitted and allowed to intervene as the alleged manager of the Mindanao Hardwood Company, the partnership to whom&nbsp; the timber license&nbsp; or concession of&nbsp; respondent Urbano Jaca was&nbsp; conveyed, and delivered for management and operation. <br><br>Even in case of doubt as to the materiality or relevancy of such question,&nbsp; it would&nbsp; be more&nbsp; in keeping with the administration&nbsp; of Justice to allow the answer to such question and render the ruling as to&nbsp; its admissibility&nbsp; when&nbsp; all the evidence are in.<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; * * The question of the relevancy of such evidence, therefore, remains to be considered in connection with&nbsp; the&nbsp; suppletory and correlative&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; introduced. If&nbsp; no&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; is introduced tending in any way to show its&nbsp; applicability, the court should on motion&nbsp; of the party against whom&nbsp; it was offered, exclude it&nbsp; from the jury or&nbsp; instruct them to disregard it.&nbsp; But if there&nbsp; is&nbsp; additional evidence tending to&nbsp; show&nbsp; the&nbsp; relevancy&nbsp; of that in aid of which&nbsp; it was&nbsp; offered, it&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; the peculiar province&nbsp; of the Jury to judge of its sufficiency to subserve its intended purposes." (Jones-Commentaries on&nbsp; Evidence, 2nd ed., Vol. 2, p.&nbsp; 1359).<br></blockquote>Wherefore, the petition is granted, and the ruling of the court <i>a quo<i> disallowing the&nbsp; question&nbsp; of petitioner is hereby set aside.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Endencia, Barrera,</i> </i></i>and <i><i><i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> </i></i>concur.</div>
