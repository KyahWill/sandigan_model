				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review  of a Court of Appeals'  decision.<br><br>For its  failure to  deliver  one thousand cartons of sardines, which it had  sold  to B. Cua  Hian Tek, petitioner was sued,  and  after trial was ordered by the Manila  court of  first  instance to  pay  damages, which on  appeal was reduced by the Court of Appeals to P3,240.15 representing unrealized profits. <br><br>There was  no such  contract  of  <span style="font-style: italic;">sale</span>, says petitioner, but only <span style="font-style: italic;">an option to buy</span>, which was not enforceable for lack  of consideration  because  in accordance with  Art. 1479 of the New  Civil Code "an  accepted unilateral  promise to buy or to  sell a  determinate  thing for a  price certain is binding upon the promisor  if  the promise is supported by a consideration distinct from the price." <br><br>Simple  are  the  facts  of this  case:  Dated September 13,  1951,  petitioner  sent  to respondent  a  letter of  the following  tenor:<br><blockquote>"Sir (s) /Madam:<br><br>We are pleased to make you herewith the following  firm offer, subject to  reply by September 23, 1951: Quantity  and Commodity: <br>400  Ctns.  Luneta  brand  Sardines  in  Tomato  Sauce  48/15-oz. Ovals at $8.25 Ctn. <br>300  Ctns.  Luneta  brand  Sardines  Natural  48/15  oz. tails  at $6.25 Ctn. <br>300 Ctns. Luneta brand Sardines in Tomato  Sauce 100/5-oz. tails at $7.48  Ctn. <br>Price (s): <br>All  prices are  C  and F  Manila  Consular  Pees of $6.00 to be  added. <br>Shipment: <br>During September/October from  US Ports. <br>Supplier: <br>Atkins, Kroll &amp; Co., San Francisco, Cal. U.S.A. We are looking forward to receive  <span style="font-style: italic;">your valued order</span> and  remain<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">Very truly yours,"</div></blockquote></div>The court of first  instance and  the  Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> found that  B.  Cua  Hian Tek  accepted the offer unconditionally  and delivered  his letter of acceptance Exh. B on September  21,  1951.   However,  due  to  shortage  of catch of  sardines by the  packers in California, Atkins, Kroll &amp; Co., Inc., failed  to deliver  the  commodities  it had offered for sale.  There  are  other details to  which reference  shall not be  made, as they touch the question whether the acceptance  had been handed  on time;  and on that issue the Court  of  Appeals definitely found  for plaintiff.<br><br>Anyway, in presenting its  case  before this Court petitioner does not dispute such timely acceptance.  It merely raises the point  that  the acceptance only  created <span style="font-style: italic;">an  option</span>, which, lacking consideration, had no obligatory force. <br><br>The offer Exh. A, petitioner argues, "was a promise to sell a determinate thing for a  price certain. Upon its acceptance by respondent, the  offer became an  accepted unilateral promise to sell a determinate thing for a price certain. Inasmuch as there was no  consideration to support the promise to sell distinct  from the price, it follows that  under  Art. 1479 aforequoted,  the promise is  not binding on the petitioner even if it  was accepted by respondent."  (p. 12 brief of petitioner.) <br><br>The argument, manifestly assumes  that only a <span style="font-style: italic;">unilateral promise</span>  arose when  the  offeree accepted. Such assumption is a mistake, because a <span style="font-style: italic;">bilateral</span> contract to sell and to buy was created upon  acceptance. So much so that B. Cua Hian Tek could be sued, had he backed out after accepting, by refusing to get the sardines and/or to pay for their  price. Indeed, the word  "option" is found neither in the  offer  nor in  the acceptance. On the  contrary Exh. B accepted "the firm offer for the sale" and  adds, 'the  undersigned buyer  has  immediately  filed an application for import license  * * *."  (Italics  Ours.) <br><br>Petitioner, however, insists the  offer was a mere offer of option,  because the "firm offer"  Exh.  A  was a  continuing offer to  sell  until September 23, and  "an  option is nothing more  than a  continuing offer" for  a specified time.  In our opinion, an  option  implies  more than that: it implies the legal  obligation to keep the offer open for the  time specified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Yet the letter Exh. A did not by itself produce the legal <span style="font-style: italic;">obligation</span> of keeping the offer open up to September 23.  It <span style="font-style: italic;">could be</span> withdrawn before acceptance,  because it is admitted, there was no  consideration for it.<br><blockquote>"Art. 1324.  When the offerer has  allowed the offeree a certain period  to accept,  the offer may be withdrawn at any  time  before acceptance  by communicating  such  withdrawal,  except when the option  is founded  upon a consideration, as something paid or  promised." (n) (New Civil Code.) <br><br>"Ordinarily  an  offer to buy  or sell may be withdrawn or countermanded  before  acceptance,  even  though  the offer provides  that it will  not  be withdrawn or countermanded,  or allows the offeree a certain  time within which to  accept it, <span style="font-style: italic;">unless  such provision or agreement  is  supported  by an independent  consideration.</span> *  *  * " (77 Corpus Juris  Secundum p. 636.) </blockquote>Furthermore,  an  option is  unilateral: a  promise  to sell <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> at the price fixed  whenever the offeree should decide to  exercise   his  option  within the specified  time.   After accepting  the promise and <span style="font-style: italic;">before  he  exercises his</span> option, the holder of the option is not bound  to buy.  He is free either to  buy or not  to buy later.   In this case, however, upon accepting  herein petitioner's offer a bilateral promise to sell and to buy  ensued, and the respondent  <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso  facto</span> assumed the obligations of a purchaser.   He  did not just get the right subsequently to buy or not  to  buy.  It was not  a mere option  then;  it  was bilateral  contract  of sale. <br><br>Lastly,  even  supposing  that Exh. A  granted an option which is not binding  for lack of  consideration, the authorities hold  that<br><blockquote>"If the option is given without a  consideration, it  is a mere offer of a contract of sale, which is not binding until  accepted. If, however, acceptance is  made before a withdrawal, it constitutes a binding contract of sale, even though the  option  was not supported  by a sufficient consideration.   * * *."  (77 Corpus Juris Secundum p.  652.  See  also  27 Ruling Case  Law  339 and cases cited.) <br><br>"It  can be  taken for  granted, as contended by the defendants, that  the option contract was  not valid for lack of consideration. But  it  was,  at  least,  an offer  to sell,  which was accepted  by letter, and  of this acceptance  the  offerer had  knowledge  before said  offer was withdrawn.  The  concurrence of  both  acts—the offer and the  acceptance—could at all events have generated  a contract,  if none there was before (arts.  1254  and 1262 of the Civil Code)."   (Zayco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Serra, 44 Phil. 331.) </blockquote>One additional observation should  be made before closing this opinion.   The defense in the  court of first instance rested on the proposition or propositions  that  the offer had not been accepted in due time, and/or that certain  conditions precedent  had  not  been  fulfilled.  This option-without-consideration idea was never mentioned in the  answer.  A change of theory in  the appellate courts is not permitted.<br><blockquote>"In order that a question may be raised  on  appeal, it is essential that it be within the issues made by the parties in their  pleadings. Consequently,  when a  party deliberately  adopts  a certain theory, and the case is tried and decided upon that theory in the court below,  he will not be permitted" to change  his  theory on  appeal because, to permit him to do so, would be unfair  to the adverse party." (Rules of Court by Moran mdash;1957 Ed.  Vol. I p. 715 citing Agoncillo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Javier, 38  Phil. 424; American  Express Company <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Natividad, 46 Phil. 207;  San Agustin <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Barrios, 68 Phil.  475, 480; Toribio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Dacasa, 55 Phil.  461.)</blockquote>We must  therefore hold,  as  the lower courts have held that there  was a  contract of  sale  between the  parties. And as  no  legal  excuse  has  been  proven,  the seller's failure  to  comply  therewith  gave  ground  to  an  award for  damages, which has  been  fixed  by  the  Court  of Appeals at  P3,240.15—amount  which petitioner  does  not dispute  in this final instance. <br><br>Consequently, the  decision under review  should be, and it is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioner. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
