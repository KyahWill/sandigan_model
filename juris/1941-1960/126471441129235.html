				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On September 1, 1954, judgment was  rendered in civil case No. 34 of the Justice of the Peace Court of Bansalan, province of Davao, entitled "Apolonio Pagaran <em>vs.</em> Placido Perez", for forcible entry, sentencing Perez to vacate the land involved therein and to pay Pagaran a monthly  rental of  P20 for the use and  occupation  thereof,  as well as the costs.   Soon later, or on September 9, and September 13, 1954, Perez filed, respectively, his notice of appeal to the Court of First Instance of Davao or  on November 10, 1954, Pagaran filed representing the rentals and on appeal bond for P80 for the use of  said land,  for  May  (when the action was commenced),  June, July and August, 1954. When the  case  was  already  pending  in  the  court of first  instance,  or on  November  8,  1954,  Pagaran  filed therein a motion, dated November 8,  1954,  for the  immediate execution of said  judgment,  upon the  ground  that Perez had  neither paid nor deposited the rentals for September and October, 1954,  which,  pursuant to section 8, of Rule 72,  of the Rules of  Court became due and payable on October  10, and November 10, 1954, respectively.  On November 22, 1954, Perez deposited in  court the sum of P40, representing the rentals for September and October, 1954.  It would seem, also, that the rentals for the succeeding months  were, thereafter, deposited in due time  However, on January 22, 1955, the Court of First Instance of Davao, presided over by respondent Judge, Hon. Enrique Fernandez,, issued an order authorizing the execution of the judgment of  the justice of the  peace court, as prayed for in  Pagaran's motion, dated November 8, 1954.  A reconsideration of this order having been denied,  Perez instituted the present action  for certiorari, against respondent Judge and Pagaran, predicated upon an alleged  abuse of discretion on the part of  said respondent Judge.  Upon the filing of the  petition for certiorari and of  the corresponding bond, we issued a  writ of preliminary injunction restraining the respondent Judge from executing the afore-mentioned judgment  of  the justice  of the  peace court of Bansalan.</p>
<p>It is  urged by Perez that,  in  issuing the order  of January 22, 1955, respondent Judge had abused his discretion, for: (1)  Pagaran had  impliedly waived his right to the execution  of said judgment because he failed  to appear at the hearing of his motion, dated November 8, 1954, and had allegedly accepted the rentals subsequently paid by Perez, although the same took place after  the expiration of the time provided therefor by the Rules of Court;  and   (2)  Perez had not been "properly  served" with notice  of said motion  "in the manner prescribed in the rules of court".   There is  no merit in this pretense.</p>
<p>To  begin  with, the failure to appear at the hearing of a motion implies,  neither a waiver, nor a withdrawal thereof.  At any rate,  on November  13, 1954, when  the motion for  execution of the  judgment was called  for hearing, Atty. Rose M. Lauron appeared for Atty. Godofredo Corrales, as counsel for Pagaran.</p>
<p>Moreover, the motion,  copy of which was served upon Perez, contained a. notice to  the effect that it would be submitted for resolution "on Saturday, November 13, 1954, at the usual session hour in the morning".   In fact,  Atty. Vicente  Duterte appeared for Perez  at the hearing of said motion and argued thereon.</p>
<p>Again, the  rentals for  October  and  November  were not paid to Pggaran.  Perez  merely deposited the corresponding sum <em>with the clerk of court, </em>who accepted the same without the knowledge  or consent of  Pagaran.</p>
<p>Lastly, Perez  admits that the rentals for September and October were deposited on November 22, 1954, altho pursuant to section 8, of Rule 72, of the Rules of Court, said rentals fell due on  October 10 and  November 10, 1954,  respectively.  It is well  settled that,  upon failure of the defendant in  a forcible entry  case, who  has appealed from an adverse decision of the justice of the peace or municipal court, to pay or deposit the rentals adjudicated in said decision within  the period set forth in said provision of the Rules of Court, it becomes the ministerial duty of, the court of first instance to order the execution of the aforementioned decision (Galewsky <em>vs.</em> De la Rama, 79 Phil., 583; Ang Ching Ci <em>vs.</em> De Leon,  79 Phil, 580; Lee Tian Po &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Rbdas, 81 Phil., 395; Pangilinan <em>vs.</em> Pena, 89  Phil., 122).  Hence, respondent Judge had merely complied with a duty  imposed upon him by law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is dismissed and the  writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued hereby dissolved, with costs against  petitioner Placido Perez.  It  is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C, J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo,  Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes,  J.  B.  L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
