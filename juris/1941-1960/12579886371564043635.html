				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question for decision is whether the Court Agrarian Relations has 
jurisdiction favorably to act on the complaint of herein respondents (except 
Judge Pastor Reyes) against herein petitioner. 
<p>On May 20, 1959, the former filed with the Court's Sixth Regional District, 
Naga City, a complaint for "illegal ejectment, with prayer for issuance of 
preliminary injunction" (CAR Case No. 340-Cs-58) alleging: that the Camarines 
Sur Regional Agricultural School was the owner and/or legal possessor of a 
parcel of land of about seven hectares; tilling it, Silvestre Tuscano., Eugenio 
Ablaza and Numeriano Rezo were tenants of said School; on May 16, 1958, Luis P. 
Arejola (predecessor of herein petitioner) "without the prior' knowledge and 
Consent of the complainants, through' force and intimidation fenced the entire 
area of their holding by means of barbed wire" and continually prevented them 
(the tenants) from planting thereon, unless they recognized him as the absolute 
legal owner and gave him the landholder's share; and the "tenants" were thereby 
left without adequate means of support. Therefore, complainants asked that 
Arejola be ordered to desist from molesting or interfering with their 
cultivation of the premises. (They also asked for preliminary injunction.)</p>
<p>Arejola asserted he was the lawful possessor of a parcel of land of 280 
hectares, of which he had been declared the owner by the courts; and if 
complaining "tenants" were occupying a portion thereof, they had no right to do 
so. Anyway, he argued, there being no tenancy relationship between himself and 
complainants, the Court of Agrarian Relations had no jurisdiction over the 
controversy. The remedy, he maintained was an action in the ordinary courts of 
justice for unlawful entry.</p>
<p>When the case was called for hearing, counsel for Arejola made this 
statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This representation in behalf of the respondent admits that the Agrcmltural 
School in this CAR Case No. 340-C.S., is landholder of the petitioner-tenants, 
which we dispute the ownership, and the respondent has nothing; to do with the 
contract of tenancy, implied or expressed between the Agricultural School and 
the other petitioner-tenants. We respectfully pray that judgment on the 
pleadings could be had in behalf of our answer and on the basis of the 
petition."</p></blockquote>
<p>And insisted on the Agrarian Court's lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>As the parties apparently admitted the identity of the lot and the 
dispossession of the "tenants" by Arejola, the Court, invoking sec. 21 of 
Republic Act 1199, and sec. 16 of Republic Act 2263 which provides: "it shall be 
unlawful for any third party to dispossess the tenant of his holding except by 
order of the court," directed Arejola to reinstate the "tenants" Tuscano, Ablaza 
and Rezo to their respective landholdings.</p>
<p>Hence this appeal by certiorari, raising the only question of jurisdiction, 
as already stated.</p>
<p>We have heretofore held, in at least two cases, that where no tenancy 
relationship exists between the contending parties and the situation is one 
merely of forcible entry, the Court of Agrarian Relations has no 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Thus, in Tumbaga <em>vs</em>. Vasquez, G.R. L-8719, July 17, 1956, we 
declared that when a mere intruder holds possession of property belonging to 
another, the ordinary courts do not lose jurisdiction in a forcible entry case 
even if he should claim (untruthfully) a tenancy relationship with the owner. In 
other words, where the case is really mere forcible entry, the Court of Agrarian 
Relations does not have jurisdiction. And in Pabustan vs. De Guzman, 109 Phil., 
278, we ruled that when there is no tenancy relationship between the contending 
parties, the Agrarian Court has no jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The reason is not far to seek.</p>
<p>Under sec. 7 of Republic Act 1267 (as amended by Republic Act 1409) creating 
said Court, it is given jurisdiction to consider, investigate, decide and settle 
all questions * * * involving those relationships established by law which 
determine the varying rights of persons in the cultivation and use of 
agricultural land where <em>one of the parties</em> works the land.</p>
<p>The Court is thus empowered to act where there is a legal "relationship" 
between the parties fighting before it. Such relationship must necessarily be 
that of agricultural tenancy. And the law governing agricultural tenancy, 
Republic Act 1199 explains that tenancy relationship is a "juridical tie" which 
arises between a landholder and a tenant <em>once they agree</em> expressly or 
impliedly to undertake jointly the cultivation of land belonging to the former, 
etc. [Sec. 6] (See also sections 3 and 5, Republic Act 1199.) </p>
<p>It must be remembered that the Court was established to enforce all laws and 
regulations governing the <em>relation</em> of capital and labor on all 
agricultural lands. Necessarily, the law contemplated a legal relationship 
between landowner and tenant. This does, not exist where one is owner or 
possessor and .the other a squatter of def orciant.</p>
<p>It is true that sec. 21 of Republic Act 1199 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the landholder or by a 
third party and/or the settlement and disposition of .disputes arising from the 
relationship of landholder and tenant, as well as the violation of any of the 
provisions of this Act, shall be under the original and exclusive jurisdiction 
of such courts as may now or hereafter be authorized by law to take cognizance 
of tenancy relations and 'disputes."</p></blockquote>
<p>However, we perceive no compelling reason to widen the scope of sec. 7 of 
Republic Act 1267 (as amended) creating the Court of Agrarian, Relations so as 
to include any legal dispute wherein one party is agricultural tenant, <em>no 
matter who</em> his opponent is. Considering the whole Act<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, the "third party" mentioned in the said 
sec. 21 should be construed to mean a person who is neither landholder nor 
tenant, but who acts for, openly, secretly, or factually for the landholder. For 
instance, a sheriff enforcing an execution sale against the landholder; or a 
purchaser or transferee of the land,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
or a mere dummy of the landowner.</p>
<p>No such situation obtains here. The "tenants" have no legal relationship with 
Arejola. They do not claim to be his tenants. Indeed, they refused to recognize 
him as such. They do not aver he was acting for or in connivance with their 
landlord, the Agricultural School. If the Court acted favorably to the tenants' 
desire and was consistent, it would have to declare them as "tenants" of 
<em>Arejola</em>,— (which it did not)—with the right of the latter <em>to get a 
share</em> of the crops; thereby recognizing the <em>right of Arejola to 
possession</em> (constructive at least) of the very lot which he had allegedly 
<em>fenced and entered</em> illegally. </p>
<p>One further circumstance which the Court below obviously overlooked: the 
complainant Camarines School is not a "tenant" of Arejola, nor a "tenant" at 
all. Such being the case, how could the Court intervene in a dispute between the 
latter on the one hand and such institution on the other? And when the Court 
declares the tenants as tenants of Arejola, what happens to the rights of the 
School?</p>
<p>Evidently realizing at last the peculjar situation they were in, the School 
and the tenants have refrained from contesting Arejola's petition here. Only the 
respondent judge answered, opposed it and maintained his power to act in the 
matter. </p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the certiorari petition- is granted the respondent 
judge having no jurisdiction, the decision is revoked and the complaint in CAR 
Case No. 340-Cs-58 dismissed. Without prejudice to the proper action in the 
ordinary courts of justice. No costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed.</em></p>
