				<H3>ERNEST BERG, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. VALENTIN TEUS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Late in September, 1944, defendant Valentin Teus applied from
plaintiff Ernest Berg, and the latter granted him, "a credit line up to
P80,000," to be available to Teus "for the discounting of promissory
notes payable on demand two (2) years after the declaration of
Armistice , between Japan and the United States of America, but never
before that date, bearing interest at the rate of eight (8%) per cent
per annum." Soon after, Teus obtained from Berg the aggregate sum of
P80.000, covered by six (6) promissory notes issued and delivered by
the former to the latter. To guarantee compliance with the obligation
thus contracted by him, Teus executed in Manila, on November 22, 1944,
a real estate and chattel mortgage, on several parcels of land situated
in the municipality of Candon, Ilocos Sur, and the machineries and
equipment of the Central Azucarera del Norte, operated thereon, and
belonging exclusively to Teus. Among other things, it was stipulated in
the deed of mortgage, that Teus shall seasonably pay such taxes on the
mortgaged property, as may be due from time to time; that he shall not
alienate, encumber, or otherwise dispose of said property, or make any
material alteration thereon, without the previous consent, in writing,
of Berg; and that, in case of failure of the mortgagor to comply with
any of his obligations under said deed, the mortgage shall be
automatically foreclosed, and the mortgagee could proceed with the
foreclosure, either extra-judicially or judicially, with the right, in
the latter case, to the appointment of a receiver without bond, in
addition to "attorney's fees and costs of collection to an amount equal
to ten per cent (10%) of the total indebtedness then unpaid, but not
less than two Hundred (P200) Pesos, apart from all costs and fees
allowed by the Rules of Court. . ."<p></p>
<p>Alleging that the mortgagor had violated said provisions of the deed
of mortgage, on May 19, 1948, plaintiff instituted this action in the
Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur and prayed in the complaint that
the mortgage in question be automatically foreclosed, a receiver
appointed, and judgment rendered against the defendant for the sum of
P80,000, with interest thereon, at the rate of 8 per cent per annum,
from November 22, 1944 until full payment, plus 10 per cent of the
principal and interest, as attorney's fees, and the sum of P385.57 for
the registration of the deed of mortgage, in addition to the costs. On
motion of Teus, predicated upon the Moratorium Law, the lower court
dismissed the case, but, on appeal, this Court reversed the order of
dismissal and remanded the case to the court of origin for further
proceedings. Subsequently, Teus filed an answer, admitting some
allegations of the complaint, denying other allegations thereof, and
setting up several special defenses and counterclaims.</p>
<p>After submission of the case for decision, upon a partial
stipulation of facts and the evidence presented, the Court of First
Instance of Ilocos Sur rendered a decision, the dispositive part of
which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Por consiguicnte, el Juzgado dicta decision en esta
causa declarando al demandado Sr. Don Valentin Teus en deber al
demandante Sr. Don Ernest Berg en la cantidad de Ochenta mil pesos
(P80,000) con los intereses pactados de Ocho por ciento (8%) de esta
suma desde el 22 de Noviembre de 1944 hasta el dia de su completo pago,
mas P248.80 por el registio de la Escritura de Ilipoteca Exhibit A y la
rcconstitucion de los corrcspondientes Certificados de Titulos, las
costas de apclacion (en G. R. No. L-2987) y las costas en esta
instancia; ordenando a dicho demandado a pagar al referido demandante o
depositar en este Juzgado, dentro del periodo de 90 dias desde la
fecha del servicio de esta decision, las cantidades susodichas, con Ja
advertencia de que, en defecto de dicho pago o deposito, se dispondra

la peticion de nom-bramiento de depositario y de confirmacion de la
alegada automatica designaeion del demandante corao apoderado legal y
absolviendo plenamente a Mr. Ernest Berg de la contrademanda, sin
especial prommciainiento en cuanto de las costaa ocasionadas en Virtud
de esta." (Joint Record on Appeal, pp. 146-147,)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both parties have appealed from this decision. Plaintiff maintains that the lower court erred:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. In failing to render judgment in favor of
plaintiff for the 10 per cent attorney's fees provided for in the real
and chattel mortgage, quoted in the Record on Appeal; pages 13 to 94,
and 97 to 1C9.</p>
  <p>"2. In failing to uphold and give effect to all the agreements in that mortgage (Record on Appeal pages 20 and 103).</p>
  <p>"3. In not granting plaintiff's motion for reconsideration." whereas the defendant contends that:</p>
  <p>"El
Juzgado inferior erro al condenar al demandado-apelante Valentin Teus,
a pagar al demandante-apelante la suma de ochenta mil pesos (P80,000)
con interescs al 8 por ciento anual dosde el 31 de Octubre de 1944
hasta su completo pago en moneda de circulation corriente."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Briefly stated, it is urged by the plaintiff that the defendant had
violated the terms and conditions of the aforementioned deed of
mortgage, inasmuch as he had been in default in the payment of taxes
and had conveyed to J. A. Elizalde and Manuel Elizalde the property in
question, and made material alterations thereon, without the consent of
the plaintiff, who, accordingly, insists that the lower court should
have, likewise, sentenced the defendant to pay the special indemnity
provided therefor in the contract—and to which reference has been made
in the preceding paragraphs—as prayed for in the complaint.</p>
<p>In this connection, it should be noted that during the occupation of
the Philippines by the Japanese, and, hence, at the time of the
execution and delivery of the promissory notes and the deed of mortgage
above referred to, the Central Azucarera del Norte was in the
possession and control of, as well as under operation by, the Japanese
Military Administration. Plaintiff Ernest Berg was aware of this fact.
Before abandoning the property, upon the liberation of the
Philippines,, the Japanese blew up the central, destroyed its machinery
and carried away some of its equipment. In order to rehabilitate the
central, on January 30, 1946, Teus entered into a contract with J. A.
Elizalde and Manuel Elizalde, pertinent provisions of which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"3. The Owner states and makes known that the <em>Central Azucarera Del Norte </em>had a mortgage account with the Philippine National Bank in the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000) as above stated, <em>settlement whereof was made on or about September and October, 1944, </em>and
fully realizes that the validity of such payment is for the present not
definitely settled and determined by congressional action or judicial
pronouncement, and therefore said Owner agrees with Elizalde that the
latter shall be entitled as of right to withhold payment of the
promissory notes aforementioned to the extent of Two Hundred Thousand
Pesos (P200,000) until such time as a definite policy or ruling shall
have been made on the question of the validity of the payment made with
the Philippine National Bank in settlement of the Owner's mortgage
'account. The Owner further states that <em>his subsequent mortgage obligation with Ernest Berg of Eighty Thousand Pesos</em> (P80,000),<em>
consummated on November 22, 1944, is likewise in the nature of a
contingent liability the validity of which remains to be determined by
congressional action and judicial interpretation, </em>and agrees in
relation thereto that Elizalde may withhold payment of the promissory
notes aforementioned to the extent of Eighty Thousand Pesos (P80,000)
until the validity of said transaction is definitely determined.</p>
  <p>"In
the event that the aforementioned obligations of the Owner with the
Philippine National Bank and Ernest Berg in their respective
agreements, shall be held to be valid and the liabilities thereunder to
be subsisting and enforceable, Elizalde may pay such amount to the
parties concerned out of the remaining balance of the Owner's credit
with Elizalde.</p>
  <p>"4. Once a definite policy or ruling has been
laid down by congressional act and/or judicial pronouncement on the
validity of payments made by the Owner to the Philippine National Bank
and/or legality and subsistence of his real estate and chattel mortgage
with Ernest Berg, Elizalde agrees to form with the Owner a new
corporation the name of which is to be designated later, with an
authorized capital stock of Nine Hundred Thousand Pesos (P900,000),
divided into Nine Thousand (9,000) shares with a par value of One
Hundred Pesos (P100) each share, which will absorb all assets of
Central Azucarera Del Norte, and the interest of Elizalde and the Owner
in the new entity will be on the basis of 5/9 for the former and 4/9
for the latter. Both Elizalde and the Owner may designate their
respective nominees to the corporation which may be formed pursuant to
this agreement,</p>
  <p>"6. The parties agree that Elizalde &amp; Co., Inc. shall operate and be appointed General Managers for <em>Central Azucarera Del Norte </em>or
of the new corporation to be organized later, and that said Elizalde
&amp; Co., Inc. may finance the reconstruction of the Central under
terms and conditions to be agreed upon. * * *." (Exhibit 1-9,
Stipulation of Facts, pp. 116-119; underscoring supplied.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Berg was then confined on charges of collaboration and his consent
to said contract between Teus and the Elizaldes was not secured. On
February 5, 1946, Teus sold one thousand (1,000) of his shares in the
Central Azucarera del Norte to Patrocinio Roco, with the obligation on
his part to transfer and deliver to her the corresponding certificate
of stock upon the incorporation of the Central and the issuance of said
certificate of stock.</p>
<p>Although no insurance on the mortgaged properties had been taken
prior thereto, on February 4, 1948, the Central Azucarera del Norte
insured said properties against fire for P100,250.00. The next day,
said Central obtained from the Commissioner of Securities and Exchange
the corresponding certificate of incorporation. Such was the situation
when plaintiff commenced this action on May 19, 194S. , Soon after, or
on June 18, 1948, Teus executed a deed of transfer in favor of the
corporation, Central Azucarera del Norte, containing the following
stipulations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><strong>I</strong></p>
  <p>"For and
in consideration of Nine Thousand (P9,000) fully paid up shares of the
capital stock of a corporation to be formed under the laws of the
Philippines, to be known as '<em>Central Azucarera Del Norte</em>', of
a par value each of One Hundred (P100) Pesos, Philippine Currency to be
issued upon the formation of said corporation to the following named
persons as nominees of said Grantors, to wit:<br>

<p>According to paragraphs 13-<em>a</em> and 13-<em>b</em> of the stipulation submitted by the parties:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"13-<em>a</em>. Que desde la constitucion de la corporacion denominada con el nombre '<em>Central Azucarera Del Norte</em>'

o convenio se acompaña a esta estipulacion y se marca <em>Exhibito</em> L-14. (Joint Record on Appeal, pp. 86-88.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It further appears that, as of September 4, 1948, the property in
question were delinquent in the payment of real estate taxes for the
years 1947 and 1948, in the total sum of P3,134.35; which, together
with the taxes which fell due in the meantime, were fully paid by Teus
on or before December 6, 1951 (Exhibit 8). </p>
<p>As of December 31, 1951, the <em>Central Azucarera del Norte</em>
had, however, a net asset of Pl,079,302.10, after allowing 10 per cent
for depreciation without any liability other than the obligation in
favor of plaintiff herein, for P80,000, with interest thereon.</p>
<p>In the light of the foregoing facts, although there has been a
technical violation of the terms and conditions of the deed of mortgage
above referred to, owing to delinquency in the payment of taxes, the
conveyance to the Elizaldes, and the material alterations made in the
mortgaged properties, without the consent of the mortgagee, the
circumstances surrounding these events fully justify the action taken
by His Honor, the trial Judge, for the following reasons, namely:</p>
<ol><li> When the promissory notes and the deed of mort gage in question were executed, plaintiff knew that the <em>Central Azucarera del Norte</em>
was in the possession and under the control of the Japanese. He must
have known that the mortgaged properties were subject to the inci dents
of the hostile military occupation and must have been willing to
assume, therefore, the corresponding risks, including that oi the
subsequent damage to said properties due to acts of the Japanese
forces, which were beyond defendant's control.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>
Although the contracts with the Elizaldes were executed, and the
corresponding alterations in said properties were made, without
plaintiff's consent, said acts were per formed precisely to restore
said properties to the original condition thereof. Wliat is more, the
Elizaldes were ad vised by the defendant of his obligation in favor of
the plaintiff, and proper arrangements were made with the Elizaldes and
the Central to protect sufficiently the rights of the plaintiff, to
wit: (a) by depositing with the treas urer of the corporation, 800 of
defendant's shares of stock therein, with an aggregate par value of
P80,000, in trust and for the benefit of plaintiff Ernest Berg apart
from 2,200 shares of stock of the defendant, with an ag gregate par
value of P220,000.00, likewise, to answer for the payment of the credit
of plaintiff herein; and (b) by entering into a contract of lease, at a
reasonable rental, whereby defendant was given the option to apply the
same to the purchase of the rights of the Elizaldes and, hence, <em>to reacquire full ownership of the Central,</em>
the net assets of which, as of December 31, 1951, are worth
P1,079,302.10, without any pending obligation, except that existing in
favor of plaintiff herein. In other words, the aforementioned acts of
the defendants have inured to the benefit of plaintiff, Ernest Berg. It
is clear, however, that such acts could not have been understood by the
parties to the deed of mortgage as a "violation" of the rights of the
mortgagee. Hence, the special indemnity stipulated in said deed, for
the event of violation thereof, could not have been intended to apply
to a situation like the one under consideration.<br>
    <br>
  </li><li>
The delinquency in the payment of the real estate taxes for 1947 and
1948, is easily understandable when we consider that the mortgaged
property was unproductive, owing to the extensive damages caused by the
Japanese, and would have remained unproductive to this day, were it not
for the efforts of the defendant to rehabilitate the central by
incorporating the same with the financial backing of the Elizaldes. At
any rate, said taxes were paid on or before December 6, 1951, and any
substantial injury to the rights of the plaintiff herein was thus
avoided. Indeed, although technically mortgaged to him since 1944, the <em>Central Azucarera del Norte</em>
was then of no value to the plaintiff, it being in the hands of the
Japanese at that time. Neither was it of any practical value to him
upon the liberation of the Philippines, in view of the condition in
which it was left by the Japanese. Now, thanks to the defendant, there
is a reconstructed central, operated by the defendant himself and
producing under his seemingly competent management. Surely, he does not
deserve to be penalized for this.</li></ol>
<p>Invoking equity, defendant, in turn, alleges that instead of paying
P80,000 with the corresponding interest, in Philippine currency, for
P80,000, which he claims to have received in Japanese military notes
in 1944, he should be allowed to settle his obligation in conformity
with the Ballantyne schedule. Equity demands, however, that he live up
to the terms of his contract, which clearly contemplates payment of
P80,000 in genuine Philippine currency, not only because his promissory
notes specifically provide that payment shall be made in "Philippine
Treasury Certificates" but, also, because under the terms of the deed
of mortgage, payment of said promissory notes shall be demandable "two
(2) years <em>after</em> the declaration of Armistice between Japan and the United States of America, and <em>never before</em>." On this point, the decision appealed from merely adheres to the long line of decisions of this Court thereon. (Roño <em>vs.</em> Gomez,46 Off. Gaz., [Suppl. No. 11] 339; Gomez <em>vs.</em> Tabia, 47 Off. Gaz., [Suppl. No. 2] 641; Arevalo <em>vs.</em> Barreto, 89 Phil., 633; De la Cruz <em>vs.</em> Del Rosario G. R. No. L-4859, Minute Resolution of July 24, 1951, and Garcia <em>vs.</em> De los Santos, 93 Phil., 683, 49 Off. Gaz., 4830.)</p>
<p>However, the reservation, made in said decision, in favor of the
defendant, of the right to ask the suspension of its execution,
pursuant to the provisions of the Moratorium Laws (Executive Orders
Nos. 25 and 32, and Republic Act No. 342), although proper at the time
of the rendition of said decision (April 10, 1952), is no longer in
order, in view of our decision in the case of Rutter <em>vs.</em> Esteban, 93 Phil., 63, declaring said laws unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with the elimination of said reservation, the decision
appealed from is hereby affirmed, in all other respects, without
special pronouncement as to costs in this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Baulista Angelo</em> and <em>Reyes, J. B, L., JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
