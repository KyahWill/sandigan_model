				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Davao absolving defendant from liability for the accidental death of Quirino&nbsp; Gregorio.&nbsp; It came to&nbsp; this Court as the amount demanded in the complaint is&nbsp; more&nbsp; than P50,000.<br><br>On or before June 2,&nbsp; 1952, defendant&nbsp; was&nbsp; the owner of a truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had&nbsp; a driver and a <span style="font-style: italic;">cargador</span> or driver's helper by the name of Francisco Romera.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon of June&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 19B2, defendant ordered Romera to&nbsp; drive his truck,&nbsp; with instructions&nbsp; to follow&nbsp; another truck&nbsp; driven by his driver and help the latter&nbsp; in&nbsp; crossing Sumlog river which was then flooded, should it be&nbsp; unable to cross the river because of the flood.&nbsp; Romera at that time was not a licensed driver.&nbsp; He only&nbsp; had a student's permit, issued to him&nbsp; on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 31, 1952&nbsp; (Exhibit "1").&nbsp; The truck started from the town of Lupon&nbsp; at about 5:30&nbsp; o'clock in the afternoon, driven by Romera.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; persons boarded the truck and among them was one policeman by the name of Venancio Orfanel.&nbsp; While&nbsp; the&nbsp; truck was on&nbsp; the way, it made a stop and then Orfanel&nbsp; took the wheel from Romera, while the latter stayed on the driver's left, reclined on a&nbsp; spare tire inside of the truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the circumstances under which Orfanel was able to take hold of&nbsp; and drive the truck, there is&nbsp; some&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; and this matter will be taken up later&nbsp; in the decision.<br><br>While the&nbsp; truck&nbsp; was&nbsp; being&nbsp; driven by&nbsp; Orfanel,&nbsp; with another&nbsp; truck ahead of it driven by defendant's driver, it so happened that they&nbsp; came to a truck that was trying to park&nbsp; on the left side&nbsp; of the road.&nbsp; Romera suggested to Orfanel that he shift to low gear and&nbsp; Orfanel did so. But as they approached the. parking truck, and in order to&nbsp; avoid colliding with&nbsp; it, Orfanel&nbsp; swerved&nbsp; the truck towards the right.&nbsp; It so happened that at that time two pedestrians were&nbsp; on the&nbsp; right side of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the truck had swerved&nbsp; to&nbsp; the right and&nbsp; was proceeding to hit&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; pedestrians,&nbsp; Romera told Orfanel to apply the&nbsp; brake, but&nbsp; Orfanel instead of&nbsp; doing so put&nbsp; his&nbsp; foot on the gasoline and&nbsp; the&nbsp; truck did&nbsp; not stop but went on and hit and&nbsp; ran over one of the&nbsp; pedestrians, by the name of Quirino Gregorio.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiffs-appellants in this action are&nbsp; Gregorio's widow and his children and heirs.&nbsp; Because of&nbsp; the accident,&nbsp; Orfanel was&nbsp; prosecuted&nbsp; for homicide with reckless imprudence.&nbsp; He pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced accordingly.<br><br>As&nbsp; hinted&nbsp; above, an&nbsp; important issue&nbsp; in the case has relation&nbsp; to the circumstances&nbsp; under&nbsp; which Orfanel&nbsp; was ablei to take&nbsp; hold of the wheel and drive the truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; To sustain the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; that&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; <i>cargador</i> Francisco Romera was negligent,&nbsp; plaintiffs introduced&nbsp; one Javier A.&nbsp; Dayo as&nbsp; a witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this witness the truck was speeding&nbsp; at the rate of 20 miles an hour.&nbsp; According to him also, while the truck was about to pass by their&nbsp; house&nbsp; of one Lucio,&nbsp; running at a speed of 20 miles per&nbsp; hour,&nbsp; he heard Romera shouting "hand brake!&nbsp; hand brake!"; that both Orfanel and Romera tried&nbsp; to turn the driver's&nbsp; wheel&nbsp; to the left and direct&nbsp; the&nbsp; truck&nbsp; towards the&nbsp; left to avoid the collision.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this&nbsp; witness also, Romera gave the&nbsp; wheel to&nbsp; Orfanel&nbsp; voluntarily upon the&nbsp; request of the latter.<br><br>Plaintiffs&nbsp; also sought to prove that Romera gave the truck voluntarily to the policeman by presenting the affidavit of Romera made on June S, 1952 (Exhibit "1").&nbsp;&nbsp; This affidavit, however, is inadmissible as evidence&nbsp; against the Vda. de Gregorio, et al. vs. Go Chong defendant because it is hearsay with respect to him.&nbsp; It may not be considered as&nbsp; part of the res gestae either, because the affidavit was taken one day after the incident.<br><br>Against the above evidence, the defendant testified that he gave&nbsp; positive instructions to Romera not to&nbsp; allow anybody to drive the truck, and Romera himself testified that he had warned Orfanel&nbsp; that his master&nbsp; prohibited him from allowing anybody&nbsp; to drive the truck,&nbsp; but that as Orfanel&nbsp; was&nbsp; a uniformed policeman and insisted that he drive the truck, and that&nbsp; as he believed that the policeman knew how to drive,&nbsp; he let him&nbsp; drive the truck.<br><br>We are of&nbsp; the belief that defendant's claim that Romera gave&nbsp; the wheel to the policeman for fear of, or out of respect for, the latter, has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The testimony of&nbsp; witness Dayo is not corroborated&nbsp; by any other testimony.&nbsp; As he testified that he was two meters behind Romera, he could not have noticed with exactness the circumstances under which the policeman was able to get hold&nbsp; of the wheel and drive the truck and his testimony in that respect cannot be believed.&nbsp; We are, therefore, forced to the conclusion that the defendant's <i>cargador</i>, or&nbsp; Francisco Romera, gave the wheel&nbsp; to Orfanel out of respect for the latter, who was a uniformed policeman and because he believed that the latter had both the ability and the authority&nbsp; to drive the truck, especially as he himself had only a student's permit and not a driver's license.<br><br>The court&nbsp; <i>a quo</i>&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; the&nbsp; action&nbsp; on the ground that as the&nbsp; death or&nbsp; accident&nbsp; was caused by&nbsp; an act or. omission, of&nbsp; a person&nbsp; who&nbsp; is not in&nbsp; any&nbsp; way related to the defendant, and as such act or omission was punishable by law,&nbsp; and as&nbsp; a matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; fact&nbsp; he had already&nbsp; been punished therefor, no civil liability should be imposed upon the defendant. Against this&nbsp; decision the plaintiffs have appealed to this&nbsp; Court, contending&nbsp; that when&nbsp; defendant permitted his&nbsp; cargador,&nbsp; who&nbsp; wag&nbsp; not&nbsp; provided with&nbsp; a driver's&nbsp; license, to drive the truck, he thereby&nbsp; violated the provisions of the&nbsp; Revised Motor Vehicle Law (section 28, Act No. 3992),&nbsp; and&nbsp; that this constitutes negligence <i>per se</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People vs.&nbsp; Santos,&nbsp; et al., CA-G.&nbsp; R. No. 1088- 1089R.)&nbsp;&nbsp; But admitting&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sake of&nbsp; argument&nbsp; that the defendant had&nbsp; so violated the law, or may be&nbsp; deemed negligent in entrusting the truck to one who is not provided with&nbsp; a&nbsp; driver's&nbsp; license, it is clear that&nbsp; lie may&nbsp; not be declared&nbsp; liable&nbsp; for the accident&nbsp; because&nbsp; his negligence was&nbsp; not the&nbsp; direct&nbsp; and&nbsp; proximate&nbsp; cause&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The leading&nbsp; case in&nbsp; this jurisdiction&nbsp; on negligence is&nbsp; that of Taylor vs.&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Electric Railroad and Light&nbsp; Company, 16 Phil. 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligence as a source of obligation both under' the civil law&nbsp; and&nbsp; in American eases&nbsp; was&nbsp; carefully&nbsp; considered&nbsp; and it was held:<br><blockquote>"We agree&nbsp; with counsel for appellant that under the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code, MS under the&nbsp; generally accepted doctrine in the United&nbsp; States, the plaintiff&nbsp; in an&nbsp; action such as that&nbsp; under&nbsp; consideration,&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to establish his right to a recovery,&nbsp; must&nbsp; establish by competent evidence:<br><blockquote>"(1) Damages to the plaintiff.<br>"(2) Negligence by act or omission of which defendant personally, or some person&nbsp; for whose acts it&nbsp; must respond, was guilty.<br>"(3) The connection of cause&nbsp; and effect&nbsp; between the negligence and the damage."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Taylor vs. Manila Electric Railroad and Light&nbsp; Co., <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; p. 15.)</blockquote></blockquote>In&nbsp; accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of&nbsp; Spain, in order that a person may be&nbsp; held&nbsp; guilty for damage&nbsp; through&nbsp; negligence,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; that&nbsp; there be an&nbsp; act or&nbsp; omission&nbsp; on the part of the person who is to&nbsp; be&nbsp; charged&nbsp;&nbsp; with the liability&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; damage&nbsp; is produced&nbsp; by the said act&nbsp; or&nbsp; omission.<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the fundamental principle of&nbsp; proof, that the burden thereof is&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; apparent that&nbsp; it is the duty&nbsp; of him&nbsp; who&nbsp; shall&nbsp; claim&nbsp; damages to establish&nbsp; their existence.&nbsp; The&nbsp; decisions of April 8, 1896,&nbsp; and March 18, July&nbsp; 6, and September&nbsp; 27, 1898, have especially supported the principle, the first setting' forth in detail the necessary points of the proof. which are&nbsp; two:&nbsp; An&nbsp; Act or omission&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the person who is to he&nbsp; charged with the liability, and the production of the damage by&nbsp; said act or omission.<br><br>"This includes, by inference,&nbsp; the establishment' of a&nbsp; relation of cause or effect between the act or the omission and the damage; the latter must be&nbsp; the&nbsp; direct result of one o£ the first two.&nbsp; As the decision of March&nbsp; 22, 1881, said,&nbsp; it is necessary that&nbsp; the damages&nbsp; result&nbsp; immediately and&nbsp; directly from an act performed culpably&nbsp; and wrongfully; 'necessarily presupposing a legal ground for Imjuitability.' "&nbsp; (Taylor vs.&nbsp; Manila Electric Railroad and&nbsp; Light Co., <i>supra</i>, p. 28.)</blockquote>It is&nbsp; evident that&nbsp; the proximatej&nbsp; immediate and direct cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; death&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiffs'&nbsp; intestate&nbsp; was the negligence&nbsp; of Orfanel,&nbsp; a uniformed policeman, ,who&nbsp; took the&nbsp; wheel&nbsp; of the truck from defendant's&nbsp; cargador, in spite&nbsp; of the protest&nbsp; of the&nbsp; latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason for absolving&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; therefor is&nbsp; not because the&nbsp; one responsible for the accident had already received indemnification&nbsp; for the&nbsp; accident, but because&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no direct and proximate causal&nbsp; connection between&nbsp; the negligence or violation of the law by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant to the death of the plaintiffs* intestate.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations,&nbsp; the judgment appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; "without&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
