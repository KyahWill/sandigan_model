				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs Benita O. Chioco&nbsp; and her husband Constancio Padilla are appealing&nbsp; the orders of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Nueva Ecija of June&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1956, dismissing their complaint, and of July 27, 1956, denying their motion for reconsideration, in Civil Case No. 2090.<br><br>From&nbsp; what we gather from the pleadings&nbsp; and the appealed orders, the&nbsp; following facts may be narrated.&nbsp; On February 5, 1927, Lot 1709 of the San Jose Cadastre, Nueva Ecija,&nbsp; with an area of 1,606 square meters, was registered under&nbsp; the&nbsp; Torrens&nbsp; System in the name of Liceria de la Cruz and Lucina&nbsp; Virgo&nbsp; (OCT 6964). Some time in 1929, Julia Ortiz Luis,&nbsp; mother of&nbsp; plaintiff Chioco,&nbsp; allegedly bought from the registered&nbsp; owner Liceria de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Cruz, grandmother of the defendant, Severo Ongsiapco,&nbsp; a portion of Lot 1709,&nbsp; with an area of&nbsp; about 444 square meters, but the deed of sale was never&nbsp; registered, neither could the original or a copy of the instrument be&nbsp; produced.<br><br>On March 7, 1931, the entire Lot 1709 was sold&nbsp; at public auction by virtue of a decision in favor of Benedicto Adorable and&nbsp; against&nbsp; Liceria de la Cruz, Adorable in&nbsp; due time being issued TCT 14106, after&nbsp; the expiration of the period for redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 22, 1938,&nbsp; plaintiff Padilla allegedly&nbsp; bought a portion of Lot 1709,&nbsp; with an area of&nbsp; 750 square meters, and on April 24,&nbsp; 1939, at Padilla's request, he was issued a co-owner's&nbsp; copy of Adorable's&nbsp; title, TCT 14106.<br><br>On December 19, 1940, the heirs of Adorable sold to Flora Ramos the&nbsp; remaining portion&nbsp; of Lot 1709,&nbsp; with an area of 856 square meters.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Entry No.&nbsp; 2847/T-14106, p. 55, Record on Appeal).&nbsp; On September 20, 1945, Flora Ramos transferred&nbsp; her&nbsp; rights to&nbsp; Tomas&nbsp; Rizo.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Entry No. 2048/T-14106, p, 55, Record on Appeal).&nbsp; On October 4, 1945, Padilla sold the&nbsp; portion of Lot&nbsp; 1709 that he bought&nbsp; from&nbsp; Adorable to&nbsp; defendant Severo Ongsiapco, thereby making the latter and Tomas Rizo co-owners of the whole Lot&nbsp; 1709.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Entry No. 2051/T-14106, pp. 54-55, Record on Appeal).&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 29, 1946, Tomas Rizo sold his portion of the Lot 1709 to Ongsiapco and his wife and co-defendant,&nbsp; Irene&nbsp; Macaso,&nbsp; thereby consolidating their ownership of&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole lot, and&nbsp; on April 8, 1946, said spouses were issued TCT No. 22226.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Entry No. 2708/T22226, p. 56,&nbsp; Record on Appeal.)<br><br>According to the plaintiffs, however, sometime in the year 1946, the heirs of Adorable,&nbsp; buyer at&nbsp; public auction of Lot 1709, gave the option to repurchase the said lot to defendant Ongsiapco as an heir&nbsp; (grandson of Liceria de la Cruz)&nbsp; "and that is how it came to&nbsp; be that said defendants became the registered owners&nbsp; of Lot&nbsp; 1709, inadvertently&nbsp; including&nbsp; 1709-A"&nbsp; (the&nbsp; portion allegedly bought&nbsp; by Julia Ortiz&nbsp; Luis,&nbsp; mother of plaintiff&nbsp; Chioco, way back in&nbsp; 1929).&nbsp; (Paragraph 7, Complaint).&nbsp; Based on this theory, plaintiffs-appellants filed the&nbsp; present case, with two causes of action, praying&nbsp; among other&nbsp; things that judgment be rendered in their favor, ordering defendants to segregate from their title the portion of Lot&nbsp; 1709 allegedly bought by&nbsp; Julia Ortiz Luis, and&nbsp; to execute the necessary conveyance thereof to them.<br><br>On May 7, 1956, defendant Irene Macaso&nbsp; filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of lack&nbsp; of cause of action and prescription.&nbsp; On the same date, her husband and co-defendant, Ongsiapco, filed&nbsp; his answer with special defense of lack of cause of action,&nbsp; prescription, and estoppel, and with&nbsp; counterclaim&nbsp; for damages and attorney's fees.&nbsp; On June&nbsp; 11, 1956, after plaintiffs had filed their "Reply and Answer to Counterclaim" and "Answer to the Motion to Dismiss", the trial court&nbsp; dismissed the complaint against&nbsp; both defendants.&nbsp; Acting&nbsp; upon a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration,&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court on July 27,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; modified its previous order of dismissal "in the sense that the order of dismissal with respect to defendant Irene Macaso refers to both causes&nbsp; of&nbsp; action,&nbsp; but with respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the first defendant, Severo B.&nbsp; Ongsiapco,&nbsp; it refers&nbsp; merely to the first cause of action."<br><br>On appeal, appellants claim that:<br><blockquote>"I. The lower court erred in dismissing the first cause of action of the&nbsp; complaint with respect&nbsp; to both defendants.<br><br>"II. The lower court erred in holding&nbsp; that because the land is registered the plaintiff's have constructive knowledge&nbsp; of such registration, and more than ten years having elapsed,&nbsp; 'prescription bars the&nbsp; action for&nbsp; any reason,' in the&nbsp; language of the&nbsp; court."<br></blockquote>Appellants contend&nbsp; that&nbsp; since&nbsp; Ongsiapco,&nbsp; did not file a motion to&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; the first&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court erred in dismissing the complaint on&nbsp; said first cause of action.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; in his answer, Ongsiapco interposed two&nbsp; special&nbsp; defenses,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the cause&nbsp; of action states&nbsp; no cause of action,&nbsp; and that the cause of action, if any, is&nbsp; barred by prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question may&nbsp; be asked&nbsp; as to whether a complaint may be dismissed when no motion for&nbsp; dismissal is filed, but&nbsp; one or more of the grounds of dismissal&nbsp; as provided in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court is pleaded as an affirmative defense.&nbsp; Section 5,&nbsp; Rule 8 of the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court, reads&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 5. Affirmative defenses.— If&nbsp; no&nbsp; motion to dismiss has been filed, any of the grounds&nbsp; therefor as provided in&nbsp; this rule, may be pleaded&nbsp; as an affirmative defense and&nbsp; a&nbsp; preliminary hearing may be had thereon&nbsp; as if a motion to&nbsp; dismiss has been filed."<br></blockquote>We believe and hold that an affirmative defense contained in an&nbsp; answer, such as, prescription, may be&nbsp; regarded as having the effect of a motion to dismiss, as may be gathered from Section 5&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule 8&nbsp; of the Rules of Court, above-reproduced :<br><blockquote>"The provision of section 5&nbsp; permits a party&nbsp; in&nbsp; effect&nbsp; to answer and demur in&nbsp; the same pleading, for the motion&nbsp; to dismiss of the Rules of Court&nbsp; takes the place of the demurrer of the former Code of Civil&nbsp; Procedure. * *&nbsp; *" (Francisco, Rules of Court, Vol.&nbsp; I, 1948&nbsp; Ed., p. 275).<br><br>"Under this section (Sec. 5, Rule 8), any defense that may be raised by a motion to dismiss under section I, may also be interposed by answer with equal validity and effect as if&nbsp; a motion to dismiss had been filed."&nbsp; (MEJIA Civil Practice and&nbsp; Procedure, Vol. I, p. 282, citing Salvador <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Locsin, 931&nbsp; Phil., 225—words in parenthesis supplied).<br><br>"When any of the&nbsp; grounds mentioned in section 1 is alleged as an&nbsp; affirmative defense in the answer, the&nbsp; court may&nbsp; hold a preliminary hearing on such special defense as if a motion to dismiss on&nbsp; that ground had been filed."&nbsp;&nbsp; (IBID., pp.&nbsp; 282-283, citing Maglunob <i>vs.</i> Nafco, 94 Phil., 461; 50 Off. Gaz. [3], 1081).<br></blockquote>The main&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of the dismissal of the&nbsp; complaint was prescription;&nbsp; that&nbsp; since the present&nbsp; action was&nbsp; brought in&nbsp; 1956, about twenty-seven years after the alleged purchase of the portion of Lot 1709 in question by plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest, or seventeen years from&nbsp; 1939 when appellants&nbsp; claim&nbsp; to have known that Lot 1709&nbsp; was registered&nbsp; land, the action&nbsp; is barred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellants&nbsp; assail this ruling, claiming that&nbsp; there is no prescription in this case because: (1)&nbsp; defendant Ongsiapco is&nbsp; a privy&nbsp; of Liceria de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Cruz, and the sale executed&nbsp; by the latter, although not&nbsp; registered, is&nbsp; perfectly&nbsp; valid&nbsp; and binding not&nbsp; only upon the contracting parties&nbsp; but also upon their privies (supposedly including&nbsp; herein&nbsp; defendant-appellee Ongsiapco) ;&nbsp; (2) prescription neither applies to a subsisting and continuing trust&nbsp; nor&nbsp; to an&nbsp; action by the vendee&nbsp; of real property in possession&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; to&nbsp; obtain the conveyance of it;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; defendants-appellees are purchasers in bad faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was privity really involved here?&nbsp; In other words, may defendant Ongsiapco be&nbsp; regarded as a privy of his grandmother, Liceria de la Cruz, as regards the parcel in question?&nbsp;&nbsp; True,&nbsp; Ongsiapco&nbsp; is&nbsp; the grandson&nbsp; of&nbsp; Liceria de la Cruz.&nbsp; However, the basis of privity is not personal relationship but rather property:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of&nbsp; privity&nbsp; is property,&nbsp; not&nbsp; personal&nbsp; relation." (Bailey <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Sundberg,&nbsp; 49&nbsp; F. 583,&nbsp; 586 1&nbsp; CCA. 387)&nbsp; (WORDS &amp; PHRASES, Vol. 33, p. 799)<br><br>"'Privies' occupy&nbsp; that&nbsp; relation to&nbsp; others because of derivating rights of property; 'privity' relating&nbsp; to persons in&nbsp; their relation to property, not to any question independent of property."&nbsp; (Ladonia State Bank <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. McDonald (Tex.) 7 S.W. 161, 162.&nbsp; IBID., p.&nbsp; 799)<br><br>"The&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of&nbsp; 'privity'&nbsp; is&nbsp; property,&nbsp; not&nbsp; personal&nbsp; relation. Absolute identity of interest is essential to 'privity.' * * *."&nbsp; (Logan vs. Atlanta &amp; C.A.L.R.&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; 64 S.E. 515, 516, 82 S.C. 518, quoting Bigelow, Estop, p. 142; Freem.&nbsp; Judgm.&nbsp; Sec. 162; Smith vs. Moore 7 S.C. 215, 24&nbsp; Am.&nbsp; Rep. 479.)&nbsp;&nbsp; (IBID., p. 800).<br></blockquote>From the facts above-narrated, it is clear that the defendants herein&nbsp; derived&nbsp; their title to&nbsp; Lot 1709, particularly, the portion thereof in question, not because of their relationship with the original owner, Liceria de la Cruz, but by virtue of a series&nbsp; of transactions and conveyance beginning with&nbsp; the public auction sale&nbsp; of&nbsp; the whole Lot 1709 in favor of Adorable&nbsp; and the subsequent sales by Adorable's heirs of the said lot&nbsp; to different buyers, including plaintiff Padilla, culminating in&nbsp; the conveyance&nbsp; and transfer of the whole lot to. the&nbsp; defendants, all of which conveyances were duly registered according to the Land Registration Act.&nbsp; It cannot be true that defendant&nbsp; Ongsiapco as an heir of Liceria, bought the lot, including the parcel in question directly from the heirs of Adorable in the year 1946 on an option to&nbsp; repurchase, because Lot 1709 was sold at public auction in&nbsp; 1931 and the period of repurchase or redemption expired&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1932.&nbsp; This, aside from the&nbsp; fact that,&nbsp; as already stated, the&nbsp; defendants bought&nbsp; the whole Lot&nbsp; 1709 not&nbsp; from&nbsp; Adorable&nbsp; or his&nbsp; heirs but from the successive vendees of Adorable.&nbsp; Neither can the claim of appellants&nbsp; that the&nbsp; purchase of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in question by defendants&nbsp; was impressed with a trust,&nbsp; be accepted for the reason that, as already&nbsp; said, plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest Liceria de la Cruz&nbsp; lost her&nbsp; title&nbsp; to the land by reason&nbsp; of the auction&nbsp; sale&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; If Adorable, the purchaser in said public&nbsp; auction, could not be considered&nbsp; as holding said&nbsp; land in&nbsp; trust, neither could his&nbsp; successors-in-interest, including defendants herein, be so regarded.&nbsp; And the fact that one of the plaintiffs herein,&nbsp; Constancio&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; intervened&nbsp; in&nbsp; said purchase from Adorable, later selling the land he bought&nbsp; to&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; herein,&nbsp; does not&nbsp; strengthen nor&nbsp; support the position of the plaintiffs.<br><br>In view of&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing, the orders&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from are hereby affirmed, without prejudice to the continuation of the trial of the case with respect to the second cause of action&nbsp; as against defendant-appellee&nbsp; Ongsiapco.&nbsp; Appellants will pay&nbsp; the costs. <br><br><i>Paras, C.
