				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an appeal, taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; Cu&nbsp; Unjieng Sons,&nbsp; Inc., from a decision of the Board of&nbsp; Tax Appeals, now Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals, dismissing the former's petition for review of a decision of the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, finding said corporation&nbsp; liable for the&nbsp; sum of P33,490.76, as&nbsp; deficiency income&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; for the years 1946 and&nbsp; 1947, plus&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; 5%&nbsp; surcharge and&nbsp; 1% monthly interest&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; and&nbsp; affirming&nbsp; said&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; without costs.<p>The case was&nbsp; submitted to said&nbsp; Board of Tax&nbsp; Appeals upon&nbsp; a stipulation&nbsp; of facts,&nbsp; the&nbsp; pertinent&nbsp; part of which is:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"1. That the&nbsp; petitioner is a corporation duly organized and existing under the&nbsp; laws of the Philippines, with its principal office at 310&nbsp; Dasmarinas,&nbsp; Manila, and that more than 70% of the capital stock of which is&nbsp; owned by Filipino citizens;&nbsp; </p><p>"2. That the respondent&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; duly appointed,&nbsp; qualified&nbsp; and acting Collector&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines;&nbsp; </p><p>"3. That on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 29, 1948,&nbsp; the petitioner filed&nbsp; with the Philippine&nbsp; War&nbsp; Damage Commission&nbsp; a&nbsp; claim&nbsp; for&nbsp; compensation in accordance with the provisions of Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1945, for losses sustained&nbsp; during the battle&nbsp; of liberation of Manila and&nbsp; other&nbsp; parts of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; total stun of Pl,079,388.05, representing&nbsp; the appraised&nbsp; value of&nbsp; the properties lost;&nbsp; </p><p>"4. That on&nbsp; June 15,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; the Philippine War&nbsp; Damage Commission notified the petitioner that only&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P671,770.19 was&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by the said&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; and that of&nbsp; this amount the sum of P470,239.13 will be paid;&nbsp; </p><p>"5. That on&nbsp; June 15,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; the Philippine War&nbsp; Damage Commission transmitted to the petitioner U.S.&nbsp; Treasury&nbsp; Warrant No. 1382483&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P202,531.06&nbsp; as partial&nbsp; payment of the approved&nbsp; claim of the petitioner;&nbsp; </p><p>"6. That on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; War&nbsp; Damage Commission transmitted a second United States Treasury Warrant No. 1471286&nbsp; for the sum of&nbsp; P151,148.31 together with&nbsp; a&nbsp; notice to the petitioner that the said&nbsp; amount of fl51,148.31 would be the last&nbsp; payment to&nbsp; be made&nbsp; by the Commission covering the claim of the petitioner,&nbsp; unless the United States Congress makes further appropriation therefor.&nbsp; </p><p>"8. That the&nbsp; petitioner filed its income tax returns&nbsp; for the years 1945, 1946, 1947,&nbsp; 1948, 1949 and&nbsp; 1950, copies of which&nbsp; are marked Exhibits 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' and&nbsp; 'F', respectively;&nbsp; </p><p>"9. That the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; paid no income&nbsp; tax for the years 1945 and&nbsp; 1946, but it&nbsp; paid to the respondent the following&nbsp; sums: <br><table align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="70%">1947 ..........................................................</td> <td width="30%">P2,483.32</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1948 ..........................................................</td> <td>51,150.14</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1949 ...........................................................</td> <td>69,925.87</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1950 ...........................................................</td> <td> 47,243.00</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </p>"10. That according to&nbsp; the&nbsp; returns filed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; it deducted the following war losses for the years set forth below:<br><table align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="70%">1945 ..........................................................</td> <td width="30%">P22,492.50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1945 ...........................................................</td> <td>P22,492.50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1946 ...........................................................</td> <td>37,875.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1947 ...........................................................</td> <td>194,315.25</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>"11. That the petitioner claimed no further war losses for any of the returns filed by it for the years 1948 and 1950, inclusive;&nbsp; </p><p>"12. That the respondent disallowed the deductions for war losses claimed&nbsp; by the petitioner for the&nbsp; years&nbsp; 1946 and&nbsp; 1947&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that all the war&nbsp; losses sustained by&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner should have&nbsp; been claimed as deduction for the year&nbsp; 1945 when the&nbsp; said losses were actually sustained, pursuant to Section&nbsp; 30(d)&nbsp; (2) of the National Internal Revenue Code;&nbsp; </p><p>"13. That by&nbsp; reason of the&nbsp; said disallowance by the respondent, the latter sent assessment notices dated April&nbsp; 11, 1949 and March 10, 1949 to the petitioner demanding the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sums of P9,540.88 and&nbsp; P23,949.88 as deficiency&nbsp; income taxes for the years 1946 and. 1947, respectively;&nbsp; </p><p>"14. That the war damage loss&nbsp; in the&nbsp; amount of P329,682.75 was&nbsp; allowed by the&nbsp; respondent and as per&nbsp; investigation, it&nbsp; was allowed&nbsp; as a deductible item&nbsp; in 1945, in accordance&nbsp; with Section 30 (d)&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code."</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Briefly stated, the issue&nbsp; is whether the losses, aggregating&nbsp; Pl,079,388.05,&nbsp; admittedly&nbsp; suffered&nbsp; by Cu&nbsp; Unjieng Sons, lac, during the battle&nbsp; for the liberation of Manila and other parts&nbsp; of the Philippines in 1945, were deductible, for&nbsp; income tax purposes,&nbsp; m&nbsp; 1945, when the losses were physically sustained, or in 1950,&nbsp; when petitioner was advised by the Philippine War Damage&nbsp; Commission that no payments, other than those effected by said&nbsp; Commission in June and November, 1950, would be made&nbsp; for said losses. The determination of this&nbsp; question hinges on the interpretation&nbsp; and construction of section 30 of&nbsp; Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 466,&nbsp; otherwise known&nbsp; as the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code, from which we quote:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>Deductions from gross income</em>.—In computing&nbsp; net&nbsp; income there shall&nbsp; be allowed as deductions—</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p><blockquote><p>"(d) Losses:</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p><blockquote><p>"(2) <em>By corporations</em>.—In&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; a corporation,&nbsp; all<em> losses actually sustained&nbsp; and charged&nbsp; off within&nbsp; the taxable&nbsp; year and not compensated for&nbsp; by&nbsp; insurance&nbsp; or otherwise,"</em>&nbsp; (National Internal Revenue Code&nbsp; or C. A. No. 466.)&nbsp; (Italic supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>This legal provision is implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 2, otherwise known as Income Tax Regulations, issued by the Secretary of&nbsp; Finance, pursuant to&nbsp; Sections 4(1) and 388 of said Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 466.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 94 and 96 of the aforementioned regulations read:</p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 94.<em> Losses by corporations.</em>—Domestic corporations may deduct&nbsp; losses actually sustained and charged off within&nbsp; the year and not compensated for&nbsp; by insurance&nbsp; or&nbsp; otherwise.</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 96.<em> Losses generally.</em>—Losses&nbsp; must usually&nbsp; be&nbsp; evidenced by closed and completed&nbsp; transactions. Moreover, the amount&nbsp; of loss must be&nbsp; reduced by&nbsp; the amount of any insurance or other compensation&nbsp; received, and&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; salvage&nbsp; value, if any, of the property * *&nbsp; *."</p></blockquote><p>It is not disputed that the losses in question could only be charged off in the income tax return for the year 1945, unless compensated for "by&nbsp; insurance or&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise." Petitioner maintains that said&nbsp; losses were so compensated for "by insurance or otherwise"; that the said&nbsp; losses were not evidenced by "closed or&nbsp; completed transaction," until notice by the&nbsp; Philippine War&nbsp; Damage&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; that further compensation therefor would not&nbsp; be, forthcoming; and&nbsp; that, inasmuch as such&nbsp; notice was given&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; it follows that the losses in question&nbsp; were not chargeable as deductions in the year 1945.&nbsp; The Collector of&nbsp; Internal Revenue and the&nbsp; Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Appeals held, however, that the&nbsp; said losses were not compensated for by insurance or&nbsp; otherwise,&nbsp; and that, accordingly, the&nbsp; corresponding deduction was&nbsp; permissible,&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1945, only,&nbsp; not&nbsp; in&nbsp; any other year.</p><p>The first question for resolution by this Court is whether the losses aforementioned were "compensated for by insurance"&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; maintains&nbsp; the&nbsp; affirmative view, relying upon&nbsp; section&nbsp; 5(g) of&nbsp; an Act of&nbsp; Congress of the United States of&nbsp; March 27, 1942, otherwise known as Public Law 50j6—77th Congress of the United States— subsections (a)&nbsp; and (6) of which provide:</p><blockquote><p>"SEC. 5g. (<em>a</em>)&nbsp; The Reconstruction Finance Corporation is hereby directed to continue to&nbsp; supply funds&nbsp; to the War Damage Corporation, a corporation created pursuant to section 5d of this Act; * * *</p><p><em>The&nbsp; Reconstruction Finance Corporation is authorized to&nbsp; and shall empower the War&nbsp; Damage Corporation to use its funds to provide, through insurance, reinsurance,&nbsp; or&nbsp; otherwise, reasonable protection against loss of&nbsp; or damage&nbsp; to property, real and personal, which may result&nbsp; from&nbsp; enemy&nbsp; attack&nbsp; (including any&nbsp; action&nbsp; taken by&nbsp;&nbsp; the military, naval, or air forces&nbsp; of the United States in resisting enemy attack),</em> with&nbsp; such general exceptions as&nbsp; the&nbsp; War Damage Corporation,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Commerce, may&nbsp; deem&nbsp; advisable.&nbsp; <em>Such protection&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; made&nbsp; available through the War&nbsp; Damage Corporation on&nbsp; and after a date to be determined and published by the&nbsp; Secretary of Commerce&nbsp; which shall not&nbsp; be later than July&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1942, upon the payment of such premium or other&nbsp; charge,&nbsp; and subject to such terms and conditions, as the War Damage&nbsp; Corporation, with the approval of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Commerce, may&nbsp; establish,&nbsp; but</em>,&nbsp; in&nbsp; view of&nbsp; the&nbsp; national interest involved, the&nbsp; War Damage Corporation shall from time to time to establish uniform&nbsp; rates for each type of&nbsp; property with&nbsp; respect to which&nbsp; such protection is made available, and, in order to establish a basis for such&nbsp; rates, such Corporation shall estimate the average risk of loss on all property of such type&nbsp; in the United States.&nbsp; <em>Such protection shall be applicable only&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; to such property situated in the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; (including the several&nbsp; States and&nbsp; the&nbsp; District of&nbsp; Columbia,),&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Canal Zone, the Territories&nbsp; and possessions of the&nbsp; United States,&nbsp; and in such&nbsp; other places&nbsp; as may&nbsp; be determined&nbsp; by the President&nbsp; to be under the dominion and&nbsp; control of the&nbsp; United States</em>,&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * Provided, That such protection&nbsp; shall not be applicable&nbsp; after&nbsp; the date&nbsp; determined by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of Commerce&nbsp; under&nbsp; this&nbsp; subsection to property in transit upon&nbsp; which&nbsp; the United States&nbsp; Maritime Commission is&nbsp; authorized to&nbsp; provide marine&nbsp; war risk&nbsp; insurance.&nbsp; The War Damage&nbsp; Commission, with the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Secretary of Commerce, may suspend,&nbsp; restrict,&nbsp; or otherwise&nbsp; limit&nbsp; such protection in&nbsp; any area&nbsp; to the extent&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; may determine&nbsp; to&nbsp; be necessary or advisable&nbsp; in consideration of&nbsp; the loss&nbsp; of control over such area by the United States making it impossible or impracticable to provide&nbsp; such protection in such area. <br></p><p>"(<em>b</em>) Subject to the authorization&nbsp; and limitations prescribed&nbsp; in subsection (a), <em>any loss&nbsp; or damage to any&nbsp; such property sustained subsequent&nbsp; " December&nbsp; 6, 1941, and prior to the date determined by the Secretary&nbsp; of Commerce under subsection (a), may be compensated by the&nbsp; War&nbsp; Damage Corporation&nbsp; without requiring a contract of insurance or the payment of premium or other charge,</em> and&nbsp; such loss or&nbsp; damage may be adjusted&nbsp; as if a policy covering such property was in fact in force&nbsp; at the time of such loss&nbsp; or damage."&nbsp; (U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 56, Part I, pp.&nbsp; 175-176.) (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>It will be noted that subsection (a)&nbsp; of said section 5(g), authorized the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to em-power the&nbsp; War Damage Corporation&nbsp; "to use its funds to provide, through insurance, reinsurance or otherwise, reasonable protection against&nbsp; loss of, or&nbsp; damage to, property which may result from enemy&nbsp; attack";&nbsp; and that "such protection&nbsp; shall be made&nbsp; available * *&nbsp; * <em>upon&nbsp; payment of such premiums or other charge</em> * *&nbsp; * as the War Damage&nbsp; Commission * *&nbsp; * may&nbsp; establish."</p><p>Pursuant to subsection (<em>b</em>)&nbsp; of said section 5(<em>g</em>),&nbsp; "any loss&nbsp; or damage to&nbsp; any such property" referred to in sub-section (a,), "sustained subsequent to December 6, 1941, <em>and&nbsp; prior to the date determined by the Secretary of Commerce under subsection </em>(a), may be&nbsp; compensated by the quoted War&nbsp; Damage Corporation without&nbsp; requiring&nbsp; a contract of insurance or&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment of&nbsp; premium&nbsp; or other&nbsp; charge."</p><p>Thus, the above quoted subsections of said Public&nbsp; Law 506—77th Congress of the United States, grant the benefits of the protection therein provided for in two cases, namely: (1)&nbsp; protection <em>"through insurance</em>, reinsurance&nbsp; or otherwise", which protection "shall be&nbsp; made&nbsp; available * * * <em>upon the payment of such premium or other</em> charge * *&nbsp; * as the War Damage Corporation * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; may establish"; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; protection "without requiring a contract of insurance or&nbsp; the payment of premium or other charge." In order to come under subsection (a), there must be&nbsp; (1) "insurance, reinsurance or otherwise"&nbsp; and&nbsp; (2) "payment of&nbsp; such premium&nbsp; or&nbsp; other&nbsp; charge * * * as the&nbsp; War Damage Corporation * * * may&nbsp; establish."&nbsp; Admittedly, neither requirement is present in the case at bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; the&nbsp; benefits of&nbsp; said subsection (a).</p><p>It claims, however, to be within the purview of subsection&nbsp; (b),&nbsp; but the&nbsp; same is&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; only&nbsp; to losses or damages "sustained&nbsp; subsequent to December&nbsp; 6, 1941, <em>and prior to the date determined by the Secretary of Commerce under subsection</em>&nbsp; (a), "pursuant&nbsp; to which&nbsp; the protection under said Act of Congress "shall be made available * * * on&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; after&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; date&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; determined&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; * by&nbsp; the Secretary of&nbsp; Commerce,<em> which shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; be later than July 1, 1942"&nbsp; Having been sustained in 1945, or "later than July 1, 1942,</em>" it follows that the losses of petitioner&nbsp; herein are&nbsp; not,&nbsp; and&nbsp; cannot be,&nbsp; covered by the provisions of the&nbsp; aforementioned subsection (<em>b</em>) of section 5(<em>g</em>).</p><p>This is borne out by the records of the hearings before the&nbsp; Committee on Territories and&nbsp; Insular&nbsp; Affairs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Senate of the United States, on the bill which later became the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Rehabilitation Act of 1946,&nbsp; Speaking&nbsp; before said&nbsp; Committee,&nbsp; John Goodloe,&nbsp; General Counsel&nbsp; for the&nbsp; War Damage Corporation said:</p><blockquote><p>"Mr. GOODLOE. Further, in the&nbsp; opinion of counsel for the KFC and&nbsp; for the War Damage Corporation, the United States&nbsp; Government and War Damage Corporation are morally&nbsp; committed to the payment of&nbsp; war&nbsp; <em>damages that occurred in the Philippine Islands after December 6, 1941, and prior to July 1, 1942</em>, to the extent of reasonable&nbsp; protection for all such damages,&nbsp; but&nbsp; not in excess of approximately&nbsp; $99,000,000&nbsp; which represents&nbsp; the&nbsp; limitation&nbsp; of $100,000,000 stated in the press release of December 13, 1941, less disbursements made and&nbsp; hereafter to&nbsp; be made on account of&nbsp; war <em>damages which occurred between December 6, 1941 and July 1, 1942</em> in the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; and its Territories and&nbsp; possession,&nbsp; exclusive of the Virgin&nbsp; Islands."&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Summarizing&nbsp; the view&nbsp; of Mr.&nbsp; Goodloe,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chairman of the&nbsp; Committee used the following&nbsp; language:</p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; CHAIRMAN.

Philippine&nbsp; Rehabilitation&nbsp; Act of 1946, which will presently be discussed, leave no reason for doubt that said term "enemy attack" was used in its common, ordinary meaning, as distinguished&nbsp; from other causes of losses&nbsp; or damage to&nbsp; property.</p><p>It is clear,&nbsp; therefor, that petitioner's losses do not come within&nbsp; the&nbsp; purview either of&nbsp; said Act of Congress of United States of March 27, 1942, or of the&nbsp; announcements above mentioned, and are&nbsp; not&nbsp; compensated for by "insurance,"&nbsp; as the term is used&nbsp; in our National Internal Revenue Code.</p><p>It is alleged, however&nbsp; that said losses could&nbsp;

Tax Regulations.&nbsp; In&nbsp; support&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; contention, petitioner invokes&nbsp; the Act of&nbsp; Congress&nbsp; of the United States of April 30, 1946, otherwise known as the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of.1946,&nbsp; (Public&nbsp; Law 370—79th Congress),&nbsp; section 102 (a)&nbsp; of which provides:</p><blockquote><p>"The Commission is hereby authorized to&nbsp; make compensation to the extent hereinafter&nbsp; provided&nbsp; on account of&nbsp; physical loss&nbsp; or destruction of or damage&nbsp; to&nbsp; property in the Philippines&nbsp; occurring after&nbsp; December&nbsp; 7, 1941 (Philippine&nbsp; time), and&nbsp; before October 1, 1945,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a result&nbsp; of one or more&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; following perils:&nbsp; (1) Enemy attack; (2) action taken&nbsp; by or at the&nbsp; request of the military,&nbsp; naval,&nbsp; or air forces of the United States to prevent&nbsp; such property&nbsp; from coming1 into the possession of the enemy; (3)&nbsp; action taken&nbsp; by enemy&nbsp; representatives, civil or military, or by the&nbsp; representatives of&nbsp; any&nbsp; government cooperating with&nbsp; the&nbsp; enemy;&nbsp; (4) action by the armed&nbsp; forces&nbsp; of the United States&nbsp; or&nbsp; other forces cooperating with the armed forces of the United States in&nbsp; opposing, resisting&nbsp; or expelling&nbsp; the enemy from the Philippines; (5) looting, pillage, or other lawlessness&nbsp; or disorder accompanying the collapse of civil authority determined by&nbsp; the Commission to have resulted from&nbsp; any of the other&nbsp; perils enumerated in this section&nbsp; or from control by enemy forces:<em> Provided,</em> That such compensation shall be payable only to qualified persons having, on December 7, 1941&nbsp; (Philippine time), and&nbsp; continuously to and including the&nbsp; time of loss or damage, an insurable interest as owner, mortgagee lien holder, or pledgee in such property so lost or damaged:<em> Provided, further, </em>That any qualified person who acquired any deceased person's interest in any property either&nbsp;

of one or more heirs,&nbsp;&nbsp; devisees, legatees,&nbsp; or distributees, all of whom are qualified persons, shall be deemed to have had&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; interest&nbsp; in&nbsp; such property during such deceased person's&nbsp;

amounts,&nbsp; as determined by the Commission, is less: (a) The&nbsp; actual cash value, at the time of loss, of property lost or destroyed and the amount of the actual&nbsp; damage to&nbsp; other property of the&nbsp; claimant which was&nbsp; damaged&nbsp; as a direct&nbsp; result&nbsp; of the causes enumerated in this&nbsp; section;&nbsp; (b) the&nbsp; cost&nbsp; of repairing&nbsp; or&nbsp; rebuilding&nbsp; such&nbsp; lost or damaged property, or replacing&nbsp; the&nbsp; same with other property of like or&nbsp; similar quality:&nbsp; <em> Provided, further, </em>, That in&nbsp; case the aggregate amount of the&nbsp; claims which would be&nbsp; payable to&nbsp; any one&nbsp; claimant&nbsp; under the foregoing provisions exceeds&nbsp; $500, the aggregate amount of the claims approved in favor of such claimant shall be reduced by 25&nbsp; per centum of&nbsp; the excess&nbsp; over $500,"</p></blockquote><p>As&nbsp; above stated,&nbsp; this&nbsp; law was&nbsp; approved, and became effective, on&nbsp; <em>April 30,&nbsp; 1946</em>.&nbsp; In&nbsp; order to be entitled to defer&nbsp; deductions for&nbsp; losses&nbsp; materially sustained within a given year,&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to compensation therefor,&nbsp; "by way of insurance or otherwise",&nbsp; if any, must exist, however, <em>prior to the conclusion of said year. </em>Consequently, the approval&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Rehabilitation Act of 1946 did&nbsp; not constitute in&nbsp; 1945 a&nbsp; compensation <em>"otherwise</em>" than by insurance, and did not authorize petitioner herein to&nbsp; postpone, to another year, its claim for deduction arising from the war losses in question.</p><p>This notwithstanding, petitioner insists that said losses were&nbsp; "compensated&nbsp; for * * * otherwise" than by&nbsp; insurance <em>before the end of 1945,</em> on account of the following events:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; in October 1943, President Roosevelt recommended to the Congress of the United States that provision be made for&nbsp; the physical and&nbsp; economic rehabilitation of the&nbsp; Philippines made necessary by the ravages&nbsp; of war; (2)&nbsp; an&nbsp; Act of Congress of the&nbsp; United States, approved on June 29, 1944, created&nbsp; a Philippine Rehabilitation Commission&nbsp; to&nbsp; investigate&nbsp; all matters&nbsp; affecting the&nbsp; rehabilitation of the Philippines,&nbsp; including damages to public and private property; (3) in January, 1945, the Japanese were already&nbsp; impotent to check&nbsp; the&nbsp; advance of the American forces of liberation in the&nbsp; Philippines; (4) on February 27, 1945,&nbsp; General&nbsp; MacArthur&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that destroyed&nbsp; or&nbsp; damaged properties had to be either rehabilitated or indemnified; (5) upon his return to the Philippines from a trip to the United States, in May 23, 1945,&nbsp; President Osmeña declared that President Truman had pledged to carry out everything President Roosevelt had promised to&nbsp; be done for&nbsp; the Philippines;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 8,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1945,&nbsp; Senator Tydings, reported to the Senate of the United States on the huge task of repairing the widespread devastation visited by war upon our soil; (7)&nbsp; soon thereafter, that same year, the War Damage&nbsp; Corporation sent to&nbsp; the Philippines a special mission to&nbsp; survey the war damage therein and to make appropriate&nbsp; reports and recommendations for such actions as may be necessary and desirable in regard to any&nbsp; program of compensation under the Act of Congress of March 27, 1942;&nbsp; (8) based upon the report thus submitted,&nbsp; the corresponding bill was introduced&nbsp; in the Senate of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States, which passed&nbsp; it on December 5, 1945;&nbsp; (9) said bill was approved by the House of Represantatives&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; on&nbsp; April 11, 1946; and (10) on April 30,&nbsp; 1946, President Truman signed the bill, which thus became the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946.</p><p>In other words,. it is&nbsp; claimed that&nbsp; the acts&nbsp; and declarations of responsible officials and organs of the Government of the United States before the end of 1945 were such as to constitute "conclusive assurances that property owners had reasonable expectation, that their war losses would be compensated for." This&nbsp; "reasonable&nbsp; expectation", it is said, sufficed to place&nbsp; the losses&nbsp; of herein petitioner, during&nbsp; 1945, within the purview of the phrase&nbsp; "compensated for * * * otherwise" than by insurance in section 30 of our&nbsp; National Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code.</p><p>Upon careful consideration of the reasons adduced, and the authorities&nbsp; cited, by counsel for the petitioner and the <em>amici&nbsp; curiae</em> to bolster up this contention, we&nbsp; find that same&nbsp; is untenable.&nbsp; In&nbsp; general,&nbsp; the word "otherwise" means but for,&nbsp; or under other circumstances (Shepherd <em>vs</em>. Davis, 110 A, 17, 19, 91, N. J. Eq. 468, 30 W &amp; P 496) ; in a different manner; in another way, or in other ways (Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. of Baltimore <em>vs</em>. New York Life Insurance Co.,&nbsp; D.C.&nbsp; Md.,&nbsp; 14&nbsp; F&nbsp; Supp. 721,&nbsp; 726).&nbsp; However, when said term is immediately preceded by an enumeration, it should receive an <span style="font-style: italic;">ejusdem generis</span> interpretation, or be limited&nbsp; in its application by the&nbsp; rule&nbsp; nosotur&nbsp; a socus. In&nbsp; this&nbsp; connection, words and phrases uses the following language:</p><blockquote><p>"Under the&nbsp; 'ejusdem generis'&nbsp; rule, a 'clean-up' phrase, such as the term&nbsp; 'otherwise'&nbsp; with respect to a classification which immediately precedes it, includes only <em>things of a like or similar&nbsp; kind</em>, and&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; of a higher&nbsp; class than&nbsp; that&nbsp; which it immediately follows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hodgson&nbsp; <em>vs</em>.

(30&nbsp; Words &amp;&nbsp; Phrases,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; Cumulative&nbsp; Annual&nbsp; Pocket Part, p.&nbsp; 124;&nbsp; italics&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>In other words,&nbsp; the&nbsp; vocable&nbsp; "otherwise"&nbsp; in the clause "compensated for&nbsp; by insurance&nbsp; or otherwise" (in section 30 of our National Internal Revenue Code) should be construed to refer to compensation due under a title <em>analogous or similar to insurance.</em>&nbsp; Inasmuch as the latter is a contract establishing a legal obligation (Sec.&nbsp; 2, Art. No. 2427), it follows that in order to be deemed "compensated for&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; otherwise", the losses sustained by a tax payer must be covered by a&nbsp; judicially enforceable<em> right,</em> springing from any of the juridical sources of obligations, namely: law, contract, quasicon tract, torts or&nbsp; crime (Art. 1157, Civil Code&nbsp; of the Philippines; Art. 1089, Civil Code of Spain).&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; Mertens,&nbsp; in his work on the "Law of Federal Income Taxation"&nbsp; (Vol. 5,&nbsp; p. 104), states:</p><blockquote><p>"* * * The term 'or otherwise' is broad enough to cover any form of off-setting&nbsp; benefit as well as actual recoupment. However,&nbsp; there must be&nbsp; a measurable right&nbsp; to compensation for the&nbsp; loss&nbsp; with ultimate collection&nbsp; reasonably&nbsp; clear."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Thus, deduction may not be claimed&nbsp; when the taxpayer is indemnified against&nbsp; loss by a third party's guaranty (Dunne <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, 75 F. 2d 255; Lewellyn <em>vs</em>. Electric Reduction&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; 275 U.S. 243) or by&nbsp; an insurance policy (Allied&nbsp; Turriers&nbsp; Corporation <em>vs</em>. Commissioner, 24 BTA&nbsp; 457; Harwick <em>vs</em>. Commissioner, TC Memo, October 4,&nbsp; 1949 aff'd 184 F. 2d 825;&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of Rose Licht, 37 BTA&nbsp; 1096); or when the guilty party is bound to indemnify said loss, it being the result&nbsp; of a breach of contract (Foley et al. <em>vs</em>. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 94 JF. 2d 958; Lucas <em>vs</em>. American Code Co., 280 U.&nbsp; S. 445; Louisville Trust Co. <em>vs</em>. Glen. 33 F. Supp. 403, aff'd 124 F. 2d 418; Bernard Schulenklooper, T. C. Memo. Par. 47203, P. k.); or when the damages resulting from&nbsp; one phase of a given transaction are offset by the benefits derived&nbsp; from another&nbsp; phase of the same transaction (Taylor <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; MacLaughlin, 30 F. Supp. 19).&nbsp; In these cases, there was a legal right to be indemnified and, hence, compensated.</p><p>Even, however, if there&nbsp; were such right, the loss would be deductible in the year in which it took place materially, when the possibility of recovery is remote (E. R, Hawks, 35 BTA&nbsp; 784).&nbsp; For&nbsp; this&nbsp; reason, it was held in Commissioner of Internal Revenue <em>vs</em>. Thalcher &amp; Son, 76 F. 2d 900 (CCA 2nd,&nbsp; 1935) that a general contractor's claim against a defaulting subcontractor for&nbsp; damages was too contingent and uncertain to the regarded&nbsp; as&nbsp; compensated for in the year in which the default took place.&nbsp; Similarly, in U. S. <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; White Dental Manufacturing Co. (274 U. S. 398, 71 L. ed. 1120, 47 S. Ct. 598),&nbsp; the&nbsp; losses&nbsp; sustained by a&nbsp; Pennsylvania Corporation, on account of the mismanagement of its properties, in Berlin, by the German Government, which seized&nbsp; those&nbsp; properties in March, 1918, were deductible from the&nbsp; gross income&nbsp; in that year.&nbsp; In this connection, we should bear in mind that the rules of international law expressly forbid the confiscation of private property owned by an enemy(see Arts. 46 and 47 of the Hague Regulations; Haw Pia <em>vs</em>. China Banking Corporation, 80 Phil., 604),&nbsp; and that,&nbsp; accordingly the latter was legally&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; compensation for said losses.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fact did not bar, however, the deduction thereof from the gross income of the taxpayer,&nbsp; the possibility&nbsp; of collecting said compensation being dependent upon&nbsp; the hazards of the war then in&nbsp; progress.&nbsp; <em>At any rate, there has&nbsp; never been any case&nbsp; in which&nbsp; the words "or otherwise", in the income&nbsp; tax&nbsp; law,&nbsp; have been&nbsp; held&nbsp; to include the hope,&nbsp; or even&nbsp; the moral certainty, that a proposed&nbsp; legislation— authorizing&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of an indemnity,&nbsp; not due,&nbsp; either under the general principles of law,&nbsp; or under any&nbsp; particular statute—would eventually be approved.</em></p><p>Upon the other hand, "compensation shall take place"— according to&nbsp; articles 1278 of the&nbsp; Civil Code of the Philippines—"when two persons, in their&nbsp; own<em> right,</em> are <em>creditors and debtors</em> of&nbsp; each other."&nbsp; (See,&nbsp; also, Art. 1195 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil Code of Spain). This&nbsp; reciprocal "right", between&nbsp; "creditors&nbsp; and&nbsp; debtors", connotes,&nbsp; necessarily, juridical relations productive of<em> legal obligations,</em> which did&nbsp; not exist between&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; and the&nbsp; herein petitioner in 1945.</p><p>The amid curiae invokes the case of Mine Hill &amp; Schul-kill&nbsp; Haven R. Co.&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Smith (184 F. 2d. 422), in which it was held that:</p><blockquote><p>"*&nbsp; * * determination of&nbsp; the year of loss calls for 'a practical, not a legal, test' and requires a consideration of&nbsp; all pertinent facts and circumstances, regardless of their objective or subjective nature; the standard for determining the year for the deduction of a loss 'is a flexible one,&nbsp; varying&nbsp; according to the circumstances of each case'; the taxpayer's&nbsp; conduct and attitude are to be considered but they&nbsp; are not decisive; the&nbsp; taxpayer&nbsp; has the burden of establishing: that&nbsp; a claimed deductible loss was&nbsp; sustained in&nbsp; the taxable year; the question as to the year when the loss&nbsp; was sustained is purely one of fact&nbsp; * *&nbsp; ." 184 F. 2d 422,&nbsp; 426.)</p></blockquote><p>Said&nbsp; decision&nbsp; is not in point.&nbsp; It refers to the time at which a given loss should be deemed sustained <em>as a matter of fact</em>&nbsp; The issue therein was&nbsp; whether the losses in certain&nbsp; railroad&nbsp; branch lines, which had not been&nbsp; used for a number of years prior to 1942, should&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed sustained&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1942&nbsp; and 1943, when said lines were&nbsp; torn up by authority of&nbsp; the Interstate&nbsp; Commerce&nbsp; Commission, as claimed by the taxpayer.&nbsp; The district court decided&nbsp; the question in the negative, following&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory of&nbsp; the Collector of Internal Revenue&nbsp; to&nbsp; the effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; said lines had&nbsp; suffered material&nbsp; deterioration&nbsp; before&nbsp; 1942.&nbsp; Such decision&nbsp; was&nbsp; affirmed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States Court of Appeals&nbsp; (Third Circuit).&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is admitted&nbsp; that petitioner's property were&nbsp; physically lost or damaged in&nbsp; 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; issue&nbsp; is&nbsp; whether&nbsp; said losses were then "compensated for by insurance or otherwise"— which is&nbsp; a question both of law and fact, although more of law.</p><p>It is&nbsp; not contended that indemnity was due to petitioner herein&nbsp; by reason of tort, crime or quasi-contract.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, petitioner&nbsp; had, in 1945,&nbsp; no&nbsp; right&nbsp; to indemnity springing from law, for the Philippine&nbsp; Rehabilitation&nbsp; Act was not approved until&nbsp; April, 1946.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then again,&nbsp; the press releases and announcements&nbsp; already adverted to created neither a legal obligation nor a contractual one, either&nbsp; express&nbsp; or&nbsp; implied.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were mere expressions of a policy of the <em>Executive Department</em> of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; They implied no intent to vest, and did&nbsp; not&nbsp; vest, in the owners of property&nbsp; damaged or destroyed in the Philippines during&nbsp; the war, a legal right to&nbsp; demand indemnity&nbsp; from the United States.</p><blockquote><p>"Announcement&nbsp; of an official governmental policy by President of the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; does not give&nbsp; rise to a contract in and of itself, for&nbsp; announcement&nbsp; of policy does no&nbsp; more than authorize appropriate government agency to enter into a contract consistent with policy."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Reconstruction Finance Corp.&nbsp; <em>v.</em> MacArthur Mining Go., Inc., No.&nbsp; 14121, United States&nbsp; Court of Appeals, Eight Circuit, Nov. 6, 1950&nbsp; [syllabus], 184 F. 2d&nbsp; 913.)</p></blockquote><p>Moreover, the payment of indemnity by the United States necessarily&nbsp; required&nbsp; an appropriation of&nbsp; public funds which&nbsp; could be&nbsp; made only by an act of Congress of the United States, and,&nbsp; as&nbsp; regards war losses or damages sustained&nbsp; in the Philippines "later&nbsp; than July 1,&nbsp; 1942"&nbsp; (like those of&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; herein), no&nbsp; such&nbsp; appropriation law existed at the close&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1945&nbsp; or before.&nbsp;&nbsp; The theory to the effect that an implied contract resulted from the announcement of&nbsp; said policy becomes clearly devoid of&nbsp; merit when we&nbsp; bear&nbsp; in&nbsp; mind&nbsp; that&nbsp; the President of the United States could have validly (though,&nbsp; perhaps, not wisely)&nbsp; changed said policy, without&nbsp; violating&nbsp;&nbsp; either&nbsp; the&nbsp; due&nbsp; process clause&nbsp; or the constitutional&nbsp; provision against&nbsp; impairment of contractual obligations.</p><p>The&nbsp; accuracy&nbsp; of&nbsp; this self-evident propositions&nbsp; is impliedly admitted in&nbsp; petitioner's brief.&nbsp; Thus, in an effort to distinguish the case at bar from that of U. S. <em>vs</em>. White Dental Manufacturing&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; (<em>supra,</em>)&nbsp; cited in the&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; Board of Tax Appeals, petitioner stresses&nbsp; the fact that "the obligation to pay * *&nbsp; * compensation&nbsp; for war losses sustained by&nbsp; the petitioner during the war&nbsp; <em>was expressly&nbsp; provided&nbsp; by&nbsp; law"</em>&nbsp; (referring&nbsp; evidently to&nbsp; the Philippine Rehabilitation&nbsp; Act of 1946), and that no such legislation existed in the case of the White Dental Manufacturing Co.&nbsp; This is an implicit, but, clear, acknowledgment of the fact that <em>petitioner's right to indemnity for its war losses accrued upon the approval of said Act of Congress </em>of the United States.&nbsp; In&nbsp; short, such right did not exist, in legal&nbsp; contemplation, during the year 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, petitioner&nbsp; says that its right to compensation "was created by law" and entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; the statute book" (p. 39, Petitioner's&nbsp; Brief).&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, it could have no legal&nbsp; recognition, much less any juridical effect, prior to April 30,1946, when said&nbsp; legislation was&nbsp; approved and became effective.</p><p>Thus, in the aforementioned hearings before the Committee on&nbsp; Territories and Insular Affairs of the Senate of the United States, counsel for the War Damage Corporation expressed the following view:</p><blockquote><p>"In&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; of&nbsp; Counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; Reconstruction&nbsp;&nbsp; Finance Corporation and War Damage Corporation <em>neither the&nbsp; United States Government nor the War Damage Corporation is legally committed</em> to make&nbsp; payment on account of war damages&nbsp; in the Philippine Islands either by reason of the press release of December 22, 1941, or the Act&nbsp; of March 27, 1942.</p><p>"In our opinion, the United States Government and&nbsp; War Damage Corporation are morally committed to the payment of war damages that&nbsp; occurred in the Philippine Island after December 6, 1941, and before July 1, 1942, to the extent of reasonable protection' for all such&nbsp; damages, but not in excess of approximately $99,000,000, which represents the limitation of P100,000,000 stated in the press release of December 13,&nbsp; 1941, less disbursements&nbsp; made and hereafter to be made on&nbsp; account&nbsp; of war damage which&nbsp; occurred&nbsp; between December 6, 1941, and July 1, 1942, in the United&nbsp; States or its territories and possessions, exclusive&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands.</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><blockquote><p>"<em>In mir opinion,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are not&nbsp; legally or morally&nbsp; committed</em> to pay&nbsp; for war damages which&nbsp; occurred in the Philippine&nbsp; Islands before December 6, 1941, or after July 1,&nbsp; 1942."</p></blockquote><p>The feeling that the United States&nbsp; had no legal obligation to indemnify war losses like those sustained by herein petitioner was such that, speaking before the same Committee,&nbsp; as member of&nbsp; the Philippine Rehabilitation Commission,&nbsp; Tomas L. Cabili,&nbsp; said:</p><blockquote><p>"I was more impressed by the fact that while it is claimed<em> that there is no legal obligation</em> on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; to compensate the Philippines for the destruction caused by this war, yet it is recognized that a moral obligation exists.&nbsp; To me&nbsp; <em>moral</em> obligations are&nbsp; more&nbsp; binding, as legal obligations might be circumvented.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is to the great credit of the American people that they should approach this problem&nbsp; from the moral&nbsp; standpoint."</p></blockquote><p>Needless to say, the Government of the United States was under no legal obligation to pay indemnity for losses caused&nbsp; by the enemy in the Philippines.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; was&nbsp; it. liable for damages caused by the&nbsp; American forces&nbsp; during its war operations therein, in conformity with the laws and customs of war.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S.&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Caltex [Philippines], Inc.,&nbsp; et al., 97 L. ed.&nbsp; 157; U. S. <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Pacific R. Co., 120 U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; 227; Juragua Iron Co. <em>vs</em>. U. S., 212&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S. 297).&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the indemnity provided for in the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of&nbsp; 1946 was&nbsp; purely an obligation voluntarily assumed solely for moral considerations,&nbsp; and did not exist as&nbsp; a&nbsp; legal obligation&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to the approval of&nbsp; said Act on April 30, 1946.</p><p>Evidently,&nbsp; petitioner shared&nbsp; this&nbsp; view&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1945,&nbsp; 1946 and 1947, for its conduct&nbsp; during those years clearly&nbsp; indicates that it&nbsp; did&nbsp; not believe its war losses in 1945 were then "compensated for by insurance or otherwise".&nbsp;&nbsp; This is borne out by&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; it&nbsp; deducted part of&nbsp; said losses (P22,492.50) from its gross&nbsp; income of P56,430.21 in 1945.5&nbsp; In other words, it thus&nbsp; regarded its war losses as closed and completed transactions&nbsp; during the year 1945. It likewise,&nbsp; charged&nbsp; off said losses, partly (P37,875.O0) in 1946 (when its gross income amounted to P129,778.20)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; and partly&nbsp; (P194,315.25)&nbsp; in 1947&nbsp; (when its gross income amounted to P324,512.50) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; petitioner, in&nbsp; effect, represented to the Government that it did not consider the question relative to its war losses as having been left open, in 1945, by the statements of officers of the Government of the United States, above referred to, by the introduction of the bill which later on&nbsp; became the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946, and by the approval thereof, and that said question was closed prior to receipt of the aforementioned notice of the Philippine War Damage Commission in November, 1950.&nbsp; In fact, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; petitioner did&nbsp; not include in his income tax return for 1950 any deduction for war losses, although the same were not fully&nbsp; covered by the indemnity paid by&nbsp; said Commission.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; petitioner is now estopped from&nbsp; maintaining&nbsp; that said war losses were "compensated for by insurance or otherwise" in 1945.</p><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.
