				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction.<br><br>It appears that an information having filed against Carlos M. Montilla for homicide, the case was set for March 15, 1950. When it was called, the Provincial Fiscal appeared but not the accused nor any attorney in his behalf. Upon motion of the prosecution, Honorable Francisco Arellano, the Judge presiding, ordered the defendant arrested and his bond confiscated. Immediately after that order was dictated, the accused appeared with his counsel, Attorney Remigio M. Pena who explained that he and his client had come from the town of Isabela and the road was muddy, in answer to the court's question why the defendant had arrived late. Attorney Pena having moved for the reconsideration of the order of arrest and confiscation of the bond, Judge Arellano set aside said order and in its place fined the accused P5.00. Then the following incident and colloquy took place:<br>

for the prosecution who is not from this place and he is only a doctor,
so his statement is only technical, perhaps about the wounds or any
scratch received by the victim. So it is not or it will not be to the
prejudice of the attorney who says that he is not prepared. The Court

  Section 7 of the Rule 114 provides that "After a plea of not guilty, except when the case is on appeal from the justice of the peace, the defendant is entitled to at least two days to prepare for trial unless the court for good cause shown shall allow further time."<br></p><br>Under this rule, accused is entitled as of right to at least two days to prepare for trial and a denial of this right is a reversible error and a ground for a new trial. (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Mejares et al., 85 Phil., 727; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Valte, 43 Phil., 907; McMicking <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Schields, 41 Phil., 971, reversed by the United States Supreme Court, 238 U. S. 99, 59 Law ed. 1220, on the ground that the defendant's remedy was by appeal and not in a proceeding in habeas corpus.) This Court, in the last-mentioned case, said: "The refusal of a trial court to give to the defendant in a criminal action, when demanded by him, the two days in which to prepare for trial * * *, such provision being mandatory and imperative, leaving no discretion in the court, deprives the accused of a constitutional right, namely, a right to trial by due process of law, and habeas corpus will lie to release him from imprisonment imposed under a judgment of conviction in such case. A trial without the opportunity to prepare for it given by the law of the land in a statute whose terms are mandatory and imperative, is no trial at all, and a conviction based upon such trial is without anything to sustain it."<br><br>The respondent Judge appearing in his own behalf does not question in his answer the right of the petitioner to have at least two days to make preparation for trial. What His Honor says is that the accused or his attorney did not make any motion expressly praying for postponement. He calls attention to the fact that Attorney Pefia limited himself toinsisting that he was not prepared to go to trial, that his services had been contracted only a few days before, that he had not yet read the record of the case and was not in a position to crossexamine the government witness, Dr. Antonio S. Caram.<br><br>To say that the petitioner did not ask for postponement is to indulge in a play of words. When counsel said that he was not ready, his purpose could be no other than that he wanted the trial put off to another date. His manifestation could have no other meaning, and it is not possible that the respondent Judge understood it in any other way. Significantly, the respondent does not say, and there is no indication, that if the accused had expressly asked for postponement he would have granted the request. His Honor wanted the case tried right then and there and it does not look as if a variation in the wording of the defendant's motion would have swayed him from his determination.<br><br>Although the respondent Judge had not raised it, the question came up in the deliberation of the case as to whether certiorari and not appeal, now or in due time, was the proper remedy.<br><br>The Court is unanimous in the opinion that the court erred in allowing over the objection of the defendant the taking of Dr. Caram's testimony, for it thereby violated the defendant's constitutional right to a due process. But an overwhelming majority also holds the view that the court acted within its jurisdiction and, for this reason, the error can only be attacked by appeal.<br><br>On this ground the petition for certiorari is dismissed, without costs.<br><br>If the parties wish the charges and counter-charges preferred against each other in the pleadings acted upon, they are advised to make said charges in separate complaints in the form provided by the Rules of Court.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
