				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JOSE LUIS GODINEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Prosecuted and tried for treason, the accused-appellant Jose Luis Godinez was 
found guilty by the Fifth Division of the People's Court, Judge F. V. Borromeo 
dissenting.
<p>He was a shipmaster in the Philippine coastwise trade before the Pacific War. 
After the Japanese invasion, from May, 1942 to June, 1943, he rendered services 
to the Japanese Navy, as pilot in the Port of Cebu, bringing their ships into 
harbor and otherwise performing work connected with navigation. He was paid 
monthly salaries. After a period of rest due to ill health, he was again engaged 
by the Japanese Army to do the same chores from May, 1943 to October, 1944, at 
varying rates of compensation.</p>
<p>The prosecution's case rests on such acts of cooperation interpreted in the 
light of incidents, hereafter mentioned which, it is argued, demonstrate 
treasonable adherence to the enemy, making defendant guilty as charged.</p>
<p>In his defense the accused swore that he had to serve the Japanese because he 
was required by them to do so, that he could not give any valid excuses, that if 
he made any false statements he would be caught, and killed; and that even if he 
could escape, the many members of his immediate family would be left to their 
ruthless ill-will.</p>
<p>The majority of the trial judges discounted this explanation saying, in 
effect, that the danger to the accused was not imminent, because other merchant 
marine officers, like Captain Obosa and Joaquin Alex succeeded in evading 
service to the Japanese and were not molested. It was not demonstrated, however, 
that these seamen were surrounded by the same circumstances of herein indictee, 
as to family members, means of evasion, personal relations or conditions, etc., 
all of which necessarily affected any decision to serve or not to serve. To 
clinch its case the prosecution should have attested that appellant had a valid 
excuse or that he could have eluded the wrath of the masters. Furtheremore, the 
mere fact that some Filipinos were brave enough to refuse and were lucky enough 
to be let alone is no conclusive reason to hold that in truth there was no 
danger in denying the conqueror's demands. There were persons put to death or 
maltreated for so refusing, and that was known at the time, as admitted on the 
stand by the people's witness Francisco Garcia. Again, it may be that such 
marine officers were not pressed by the Japanese precisely because the herein 
accused and others (Eduardo Gonzales, Marcelo Ayesa) had consented to render 
pilotage service. Those who refused to cooperate, in the face of danger, were 
patriotic citizens; but it does not follow that the faintheart, who gave in, 
were traitors. On this subject the statement of President Osmeña in November 
1944, may be quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Not all public officials could take to the hills to carry on the 
heroic struggle. Some had to remain in their posts to maintain a semblance of 
government, to protect the population from the oppressor to the extent possible 
by human ingenuity and to comfort the people in their misery. Had their services 
not been available, the Japanese would either have themselves governed directly 
and completely or utilized unscrupulous Filipino followers capable of any 
treason to their people. The result would have been calamitous and the injuries 
inflicted to our body politic beyond cure.</p>
<p>"The problem under consideration must be solved with justice and dignity. 
Every case should be examined impartially and decided on its own merits. Persons 
holding public office during enemy occupation, for the most part, fall within 
three categories; those prompted by a desire to protect the people, those 
actuated by fear of enemy reprisals, and those motivated by disloyalty to our 
government and cause. The motives which caused the retention of the office and 
conduct while in office, rather than the sole fact of its occupation, will be 
the criteria upon which such persons will be judged." (Official Gazette, Vol. 
41, No. 1, p. 102.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is now undisputed that mere governmental work under the Japanese 
regime—and pilotage service may be considered in the same light<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>—does not constitute <i>per se</i> indictable 
disloyalty.</p>
<p>It is contended, however, that appellant's help to the Japanese <i>together 
with</i> criminal intention to betray render him guilty of treason. Proof of 
this traitorous intent is made to consist of five circumstances described in the 
brief of the Solicitor General as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) During the year 1943, accused often went to the coffee shop of S. P. 
Banis and during the discussion between Banis and appellant, the latter always 
showed his pro-Japanese sentiments. On one occasion, during November, 1943, 
Banis told him about the expected arrival of the Americans, and the appellant 
exclaimed that Banis was crazy in believing that the Americans were coming back 
to the Philippines, because according to the appellant, the American forces 
would never come back to these Islands (testimony of S. P. Banis, p. 10, t. s. 
n., Lopez).</p>
<p>"(2) Sometime in July, 1942, Capt. Canuto Obosa was in Cebu City for a few 
days. He saw the appellant inside his own automobile which carried a Japanese 
flag and on his left arm, appellant was wearing a band with Japanese characters 
(testimony of Capt. Canuto Obosa, pp. 1-2, t. s. n., Lopez).</p>
<p>"(3) When the Japanese landed in Cebu City on April 11, 1942, the accused 
with two other persons went up a Japanese ship anchored alongside the Pier, 
presented his respects to the Japanese officer in charge of the boat, handed to 
him a revolver which was examined by said Japanese officer. The appellant showed 
how the firearm worked by firing the pistol (testimony of Antonio Yee, pp. 
14-15, t. s. n., Lopez).</p>
<p>"(4) From April, 1942 to October, 1944, the appellant had a Japanese flag 
placed on the door of his house situated at D. Jakosalem Street, Cebu City about 
a foot wide and about two feet long and on the left side of the door was a piece 
of board with Japanese Characters written on it (testimony of Antonio Yee, p. 
15, t. s. n., Lopez.)</p>
<p>"(5) During the middle of September, 1944, when American planes were dropping 
bombs in Cebu City, the appellant who was in the lawn of his house said, more or 
less, the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;'Those sons of the bitches of Americans (referring to the American 
avaitors) are the gangsters of the United States; they are drunk, they will go 
down'. (Testimony of William del Villar, p. 7, t. s. n., 
Dizon.).' "</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<ol type="I"><li>On the first point, the accused denied having stated the Americans could 
never come back, admitting, however, having expressed the belief that it was not 
easy for them to return, in view of the successive victories of the Imperial 
hordes at that time. Even if appellant had uttered the words attributed to him, 
it is doubtful whether they exhibited adherence to the foe, unless it is shown 
that he wanted, or rejoiced in the inability to return of the American forces. 
But it is hard to believe appellant wished the defeat of our allies, because he 
had two sons in the guerrilla forces. And if he ever made the remark, it was 
probably as one of those arm-chair strategists dishing out war opinions on the 
basis of doctored news fed by the propaganda machine to the local newspapers and 
broadcasting stations. The man was sadly in error; he underestimated the 
publicity corps of the Japanese Army; but should he be jailed for it? 

<p></p></li><li>The second point has no merit. Although there was proof about a Nippon flag 
fluttering on the automobile the appellant rode, no evidence was adduced that 
the car belonged to him.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>On the third point the appellant swore that when the Japanese arrived in 
Cebu, they arrested him, and when they found, after investigation, that he was a 
marine officer they ordered him to report the next day to the Port Surveyor, 
bringing any firearms he had in his possession; that he did as directed and 
surrendered his pistol. His version is entirely credible. Those who were in 
Manila during the first days of January, 1942, remember identical directives of 
the Military Commander. And if surrender of the firearm meant treasonable 
collaboration, thousands of Manila residents would be traitors too.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>About the display of the Rising Sun. The witness of the prosecution had to 
adnrt that after the fall of Cebu City the Japanese issued orders requiring 
every resident to hoist a Japanese flag in their houses and that refusal to obey 
meant death. Naturally, compliance with this decree should not be chalked 
against appellant, a resident therein. 


<p></p> </li><li>The accused denied having made the insulting statements imputed to him by 
William de Villar against American aviators that raided Cebu, and proved that 
said witness bore a grudge against him that probably colored the testimony. 
Anyway, his counsel, pleading in extenuation, submitted some endorsable comments 
upholding the proposition that strict accountability should not be demanded of 
one undergoing the nerve-racking experience of aerial bombardments, for caustic 
remarks spoken in private motivated by his apprehension for the safety of his 
family and his own. </li></ol>
<p>After considering all matters, the Court reaches the conclusion that 
defendant's disloyal heart or treacherous mind has not been established beyond 
reasonable doubt. He is absolved, with costs <i>de oficio</i>.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Padilla,</i> and <i>Tuason, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
<p><strong>MORAN, C. J.:</strong></p>I certify that Mr. Justice Feria and Mr. 
Justice Briones voted to absolve appellant.<br><br><br>
