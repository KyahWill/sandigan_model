				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the morning of March 7, 1947, Urbano Cruz, the <em>encargado</em> of the 
coconut grove of Arturo Eustaquio in Latuan and Balagtasan, city of Zamboanga, 
was informed by Lazaro Viernes, one of the guards, that there were three persons 
stealing coconuts in the said plantation. Cruz called Ernesto Fargas, the truck 
driver of Eustaquio, and accompanied by some laborers, both proceeded to the 
plantation. There the group saw three persons, chopping coconuts. When they 
approached, the trespassers started to run away, but Cruz fired a shot into the 
air, and one stopped and was apprehended. He turned out to be the herein 
appellant, Moro Isnain, who, upon investigation by the precinct commander of the 
corresponding police station (Lt. Bucoy) acknowledged his culpability, asked for 
pardon and identified his confederates as Moros Addi and Akik (who are still at 
large). Before the justice of the peace he pleaded guilty to the charge.
<p>However, in the court of first instance he changed his mind. He admitted he 
had been arrested during the raid, but submitted the flimsy excuse that he had 
merely gone to the place because he was thirsty. Anyway, he confessed that he 
joined the other two thieves in order to drink—and did drink—coconut water. This 
naturally constitutes theft of the coconuts. He also owned to having asked 
pardon from Lt. Bucoy "even to the extent of kissing his hand". Therefore there 
is no question in our minds that the appellant, with the other two runaways 
unlawfully picked coconuts from the plantation of Arturo Eustaquio, fruits 
which, according to the evidence, were valued at more than thirty-three pesos 
(P33.76).</p>
<p>The only question raised with much earnestness by his attorney <em>de 
oficio</em> is that Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code classifying as 
qualified theft, the stealing of coconuts is unconstitutional, because it 
punishes the larceny of such products more heavily than the taking away of 
similar produce, such as rice and sugar, and thereby denies him the equal 
protection of the laws. It is unquestionable that the constitutional guaranty 
requires the treatment alike, in the same place and under like circumstances and 
conditions, of all persons subjected to state legislation. But a state, "as a 
part of its police power, may exercise a large measure of discretion, without 
violating the equal protection guaranty, in creating and defining criminal 
offenses, and may make classifications as to persons amenable to punishment, so 
long as the classifications are reasonable and the legislation bears equally on 
all in the same class, and, where a reasonable classification is made as between 
persons or corporations, the persons or corporations in each class nay be dealt 
with in a manner different from that employed with regard to the persons or 
corporations in other classes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>Thus it means no violation of the constitutional provision to make it a 
felony fraudulently to sell a part of a stock of trade whereas the fraudulent 
sale of other property is made a misdemeanor only, and to make it grand theft to 
steal bovine animals, and petty theft to steal other kinds of animals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>In the matter of theft of coconuts, the purpose of the heavier penalty is to 
encourage and protect the development of the coconut industry as one of the 
sources of our national economy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
Unlike rice and sugar cane farms where the range of vision is unobstructed, 
coconut groves can not be efficiently watched because of the nature of the 
growth of coconut trees; and without a special measure to protect this kind of 
property, it will be, as it has been in the past the favorite resort of 
thieves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> There is therefore, some 
reason for the special treatment accorded the industry; and as it can not be 
said that the classification is entirely without basis, the plea of 
unconstitutionality must be denied.</p>
<p>The crime is punished by Article 309, paragraph 5, in connection with Article 
310 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 417. (Republic 
Act No. 120, enacted after the offense, is not applicable). The penalty is 
<em>prision correccional</em> to its full extent. Applying the Indeterminate 
Sentence Law, the appellant should be sentenced to imprisonment for not less 
than 4 months of <em>arresto mayor</em> nor more than 4 years and 2 months of 
<em>prision correccional</em>. Thus modified, the appealed decision will be 
affirmed, with costs. So ordered.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Padilla,
