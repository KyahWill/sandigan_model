				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a&nbsp; petition to review the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA Case No. 135, upholding the validity of&nbsp; the order of the Commissioner&nbsp; of Customs in Manila Seizure Identification&nbsp; No. 2040,&nbsp; forfeiting the 138&nbsp; gold bars subject of said proceedings&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; Government.<br><br>At about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of October 8, 1954, Port Policeman Felipe de Guzman, then stationed at the central gate of Pier 9, Manila, was&nbsp; approached by three men, later identified as Venancio Carreon Tong&nbsp; Tek, his brother Juanito Tong,&nbsp; and one George Tong, an employee of the American President Lines, seeking entrance therein. As they were duly equipped with&nbsp; passes to visit American President Lines' vessel "S.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; President Cleveland", then docked&nbsp; at the aforementioned pier,&nbsp; he allowed them to get&nbsp; in.&nbsp; Later, or about 7:15&nbsp; p.m.,&nbsp; Venancio Carreon Tong Tek and Juanito Tong&nbsp; returned intending&nbsp; to get out&nbsp; of&nbsp; the premises.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegedly due to their unnatural gait and stride, the suspicion&nbsp; of guard De Guzman&nbsp; was aroused.&nbsp; He then tried to search them but they refused. With the help of the&nbsp; other guards who were&nbsp; attracted by the&nbsp; resulting commotion, the&nbsp; two brothers were taken to the Port Patrol Headquarters where1 a search on their persons yielded 4 canvass belts, found tied around their waists,&nbsp; containing 138 gold bars weighing&nbsp; 97,290&nbsp; grams and&nbsp; valued at P470,760.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Petitioner claims there were 144&nbsp; bars, but only&nbsp; 138 bars&nbsp; are&nbsp; subject of this&nbsp; case). The aforementioned&nbsp; articles were&nbsp; forthwith confiscated and&nbsp; later turned&nbsp; over&nbsp; to the National Treasurer for safekeeping.&nbsp; As a consequence thereof, seizure proceedings were instituted in the Bureau of Customs&nbsp; (S. Iden.&nbsp; No. 2040),&nbsp; simultaneous with the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of a criminal&nbsp; action with the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila against Venancio Carreon&nbsp; Tong Tek and Juanito&nbsp; Tong for alleged attempted violation of Central Bank Circular Nos. 21 and 42 (Crim.&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 30216).&nbsp; It may be mentioned in passing, as we are not concerned with the criminal aspect&nbsp; of the case, that although the accused were found guilty by the lower court,&nbsp; on appeal the decision&nbsp; was reversed&nbsp; by the Court of Appeals on the ground that under Circular Nos. 21 and&nbsp; 42, only consummated offenses are punishable (CAG.R. No. 15666-R).<br><br>On March 7,&nbsp; 1955, the Acting&nbsp; Collector of Customs rendered a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; in the seizure proceedings,&nbsp; finding therein&nbsp; claimants guilty of&nbsp; attempted&nbsp; exportation of gold without the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; license from the Central Bank and ordered the forfeiture of the articles involved therein in favor&nbsp; of the government.&nbsp;&nbsp; From said decision, claimants appealed to the Acting Commissioner of&nbsp; Customs who, on April 21, 1955, affirmed&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of the Acting&nbsp; Collector.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; matter was&nbsp; later&nbsp; elevated to the Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals and said court, in&nbsp; its decision&nbsp; of November&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; ruled that&nbsp; the 138 gold&nbsp; bars&nbsp; were validly&nbsp; forfeited&nbsp; under&nbsp; section&nbsp; 1363-(f)&nbsp; and&nbsp; <m-l)   of="" revised ="" administrative ="" code.  ="" this ="" is ="" the ="" decision="" which="" herein="" petitioners ="" seek="" to ="" have="" reviewed ="" in="" the="" instant ="" petition.=""><br><br>Reducing the issues herein raised by the petitioners&nbsp; to bare essentials, the&nbsp; questions presented&nbsp; by the instant case&nbsp; for our&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; are:<br><blockquote>1. Whether Central Bank&nbsp; Circular Nos.&nbsp; 20, 21 and 42 are valid or not;<br><br>2. Whether gold bars are subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; forfeiture&nbsp; under Section 1363 of the Revised Administrative Code;<br><br>3. Whether the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Appeals erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; upholding the validity of the order of forfeiture of the 138 gold&nbsp; bars; and<br><br>4. Whether or not the petitioners' acquittal in the criminal action bars the&nbsp; forfeiture of the merchandise in another proceeding.<br></blockquote>I. In&nbsp; so&nbsp; far&nbsp; as pertinent&nbsp; with the issues in this&nbsp; case, Central&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; Circular No. 20 and&nbsp; Circular Nos. 21 and 42 implementing it read as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote><center>"Circular No. 20<br>December 9, 1949<br></center><br>Restrictions on Gold and Foreign Exchange Transactions<br><ol><li>Pursuant to&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 26&nbsp; (Central Bank Act) the Monetary Board, by unanimous vote&nbsp; and with the approval of the President of&nbsp; the Philippines, and in accordance with Executive&nbsp; and International Agreements to which the Republic of the Philippines is a party, hereby restricts sales&nbsp; of&nbsp; exchange by the Central Bank and Subjects&nbsp; all transactions&nbsp; in&nbsp; gold and foreign exchange&nbsp; to licensing by&nbsp; the Central Bank.<br></li></ol>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exh. 8)<br>"<center>ClRCULAR NO. 21"<br>(As amended)&nbsp; October 15, 1952<br></center><br><br>Section 4. Export of&nbsp; gold<br><br>Any person desiring to export gold in any form, including jewelry, whether for&nbsp; refining&nbsp; abroad or otherwise, must&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; a license from the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; Applicants for export licenses&nbsp; must present&nbsp; satisfactory evidence&nbsp; that the import&nbsp; of&nbsp; the gold into the country of the importer&nbsp; will not be&nbsp; in violation&nbsp; of the rules and regulation of such country.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">* * * (Exh. 9)<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">"Circular&nbsp; No. 42<br>May 21,&nbsp; 1953<br></div><br>Section 2.<br><br>The following are foreign exchange transactions and&nbsp; as required by Central Bank Circular No. 20 are subject to prior licensing by or on behalf of the Central Bank;<br><br>*****&nbsp; *<br><br>(m) Any other transactions involving&nbsp; international financial implications.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">*&nbsp; * * (Exh. 10)</div></blockquote></m-l)  ><m-l)   of="" revised ="" administrative ="" code.  ="" this ="" is ="" the ="" decision="" which="" herein="" petitioners ="" seek="" to ="" have="" reviewed ="" in="" the="" instant ="" petition.="">In assailing the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the aforequoted circulars of the Central&nbsp; Bank, petitioners&nbsp; contend that there&nbsp; is no evidence to prove that they were&nbsp; duly signed and approved by the President as required by law&nbsp; ( Sec. 74, Rep. Act No. 265).&nbsp;&nbsp; In a&nbsp; recent decision,&nbsp; this Court, squarely passing upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; same question,&nbsp; held:<br><blockquote>"It is further&nbsp; argued that, as published in the Official Gazette, Circular No. 21, in its original, as well as&nbsp; in its amended form, did not&nbsp; bear the approval of the President and that, accordingly, said publication was not sufficient to&nbsp; give effect contemplated&nbsp; by law therefor.&nbsp; This&nbsp; pretense&nbsp; is&nbsp; based&nbsp; upon&nbsp; a&nbsp; false&nbsp; premise.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original&nbsp; circular subjecting to licensing&nbsp; by the Central Bank 'all transactions&nbsp; in gold and foreign exchange',&nbsp; is Circular No. 20, which, as&nbsp; approved and&nbsp; published,&nbsp; states, that,&nbsp; 'pursuant&nbsp; to the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 265', it had&nbsp; been&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; by&nbsp; 'the Monetary Board, by unanimous vote and <span style="font-style: italic;">with the approval of the President of the Philippines.',</span>&nbsp; What is more, the&nbsp; last&nbsp; paragraph of Circular No.&nbsp; 20, provides&nbsp; that 'further&nbsp; regulations&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; respect to transactions covered by this circular will&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued separately'. Thus, the&nbsp; President had&nbsp; approved not only&nbsp; the 'licensing&nbsp; by the Central&nbsp; Bank'&nbsp; of 'all&nbsp; transactions in gold and&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; exchange' but,&nbsp; also, the issuance, subsequently to the&nbsp; promulgation of Circular No. 20, of 'further regulations in respect of such transactions. Said further regulation&nbsp; were&nbsp; incorporated into Circular No. 21, which thus bears the stamp of presidential sanction, although this is not specifically required by law.&nbsp; It is only the decision&nbsp; of the Monetary Board to subject&nbsp; to license&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank all transactions in gold&nbsp; and foreign exchange that needs&nbsp; the approval of the President..&nbsp; Once the same has been given, the details in the implementation of said decision may be determined&nbsp; by said Board, through such regulations as may be promulgated&nbsp; from&nbsp; time&nbsp; to time.&nbsp; * * *".&nbsp; (Peoples <i>vs.</i> William Ernest Jolliffe,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>,&nbsp; p. 677).</blockquote>Under the aforequoted&nbsp; ruling, therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval by&nbsp; the President of&nbsp; the Philippines of&nbsp; Circular&nbsp; No; 20 not only&nbsp; satisfies the&nbsp; requirement of the&nbsp; law with&nbsp; respect to said circular but also extends to those that subsequently may be issued in implementation thereof, such as Circular No. 21, as amended,&nbsp; and Circular No. 42.&nbsp; The first issue thus&nbsp; fully met&nbsp; must&nbsp; necessarily fail.<br><br>II. The Court of Tax Appeals affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Customs&nbsp; in&nbsp; Seizure&nbsp; Identification No. 2040 on the strength&nbsp; of&nbsp; Section 1363 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, providing, among&nbsp; others:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 1363.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Property subject to&nbsp; forfeiture under customs laws.</span>— Vessels, cargo, merchandise,&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; objects and things&nbsp; shall, under the&nbsp; conditions herein-below specified, be subject to forfeiture:<br><div style="text-align: center;"><br>

Gaz., No. 10, p. 4850), the carrying&nbsp; out of transactions or&nbsp; undertakings without complying with the requirements of Circular Nos.&nbsp; 20, 21 and&nbsp; 42 makes these undertakings&nbsp; illegal. And as a&nbsp; natural consequence&nbsp; thereof, the&nbsp; articles&nbsp; involved in such&nbsp; unauthorized ventures become prohibited and, therefore, subject to forfeiture under Section 1363(f) of the Revised Administrative Code.<br><br>III. As found by the Court of Tax Appeals, the petitioners went aboard the vessel "S.S. President Cleveland" to find an unoccupied cabin where the 138 gold bars, which Venancia intended to transmit to a certain Mr. Tokida&nbsp; in Japan, could be hidden.&nbsp; Failing to find a place that will satisfactorily serve their purpose, they left the vessel for home, still&nbsp; carrying in their person the 4 canvass belt containing the gold bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the main gate on their way out, they&nbsp; were&nbsp; stopped and apprehended.&nbsp; Based&nbsp; on&nbsp; these findings of fact, which we find no reason to disturb, the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that&nbsp; Venancio&nbsp; Carreon Tong Tek attempted to export the above-mentioned gold bars&nbsp; without prior approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Central Bank&nbsp; and consequently&nbsp; affirmed the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of forfeiture&nbsp; appealed from.<br><br>Petitioners&nbsp; assert that the provision applicable to the instant case is not Section 1363-(<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>)&nbsp; but subparagraph (m-1) of the same section which makes even attempted exportation, without going through a customhouse, punishable.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; contend,&nbsp; however, that their acts&nbsp; did&nbsp; not constitute an attempted felony.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; we are now called to&nbsp; resolve whether under the forgoing&nbsp; facts, there&nbsp; has been&nbsp; an attempt to&nbsp; export gold&nbsp; without going&nbsp; through a&nbsp; customhouse (which would necessarily&nbsp; require&nbsp; a license from the Central Bank) or&nbsp; attempted smuggling, as it is commonly referred to.<br><br>Under the Revised Penal Code, an&nbsp; attempt to commit a&nbsp; felony takes place "when the offender commences the commission&nbsp; of a felony&nbsp; directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than his own&nbsp; spontaneous desistance&nbsp; (Article 6).&nbsp;&nbsp; For an offender&nbsp; to be found guilty of this wrong, the following requisites must be present:&nbsp; (1) that he has commenced the commission of the felony directly by&nbsp; some overt acts, and (2)&nbsp; that he did not perform all the acts of execution which&nbsp; would&nbsp; produce the felony due&nbsp; to some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance.&nbsp; Considering that the Revised Penal Code has suppletory effect in&nbsp; cases involving violations of special&nbsp; laws (Art.&nbsp; 10, Revised Penal Code), we will&nbsp; determine the nature of petitioners'&nbsp; action in the&nbsp; light&nbsp; of&nbsp; the aforementioned Article 6 of the Penal Code.<br><br>Petitioners maintain that their act of leaving the boat, taking along with them the gold&nbsp; bars, and with the intention to go home constitutes&nbsp; voluntary desistance and thus takes the incident out&nbsp; of the scope of an attempted felony.&nbsp; In short, petitioners claim that their plan to send the gold&nbsp; bars out of the country remained a mental state or&nbsp; still&nbsp; in&nbsp; the preparatory&nbsp; stage.&nbsp; Indeed, there&nbsp; is&nbsp; a wide&nbsp; difference between "preparation"&nbsp; and&nbsp; "attempt". The preparation&nbsp; consists in&nbsp; devising&nbsp; or arranging&nbsp; the means or measures necessary for the commission of the offense; the attempt&nbsp; is the direct movement toward&nbsp; the commission after the preparation had been&nbsp; made&nbsp; (Francisco's The Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; Book I, 2nd Ed., p. 126). From the records&nbsp; of&nbsp; the case, it appears that&nbsp; when&nbsp; Venancio and Juanito Tong visited the vessel "S.S. President Cleveland" on the night of&nbsp; October 8,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; they were armed with duly accomplished&nbsp; personal&nbsp; passes for that day (Exhs. 1 and 2),&nbsp; Apparently to insure their&nbsp; admission to the premises, as in fact they&nbsp; did.&nbsp; The act of securing the&nbsp; passes and having them countersigned by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chief of the Customs' Secret Service might be&nbsp; considered as preparation, but the act of going to the pier, at 7 o'clock in the evening,&nbsp; bringing with them 97,260 grams of gold, tied around their waists, and actually getting aboard&nbsp; the steamship looking for an unoccupied cabin or place where the&nbsp; gold&nbsp; could&nbsp; be hidden apparently to&nbsp; avoid&nbsp; detection certainly&nbsp; transform the scheme from&nbsp; a&nbsp; mental state to direct overt acts.<br><br>Petitioners, however, claim that their failure to perform all the acts of execution was due to their own spontaneous desistance.&nbsp; This allegation&nbsp; does not appear convincing enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; As found by the Collector of the Port of Manila, the Commissioner of Customs, and the Court of Appeals, they went to the boat to deposit the said bars&nbsp; and then inform Mr. Tokida about it.&nbsp; That they abandoned their original plan was not due to any feeling of repentence,&nbsp; respect for the law and authority or fear&nbsp; of the possible consequence of their nefarious activity, but due to a cause entirely independent of their own will, i.e., absence of a place that would insure non-discovery of such undeclared cargo.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; does the fact that they were apprehended only on their way out of the premises merit consideration. Section 1363 (m-1) of the Administrative Code, as correctly pointed out by&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; themselves,&nbsp; condemns&nbsp; even an attempt to send out of the&nbsp; country any merchandise without satisfying&nbsp; the requirements of the law and subjects the same to forfeiture.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their apprehension&nbsp; after they were forced to give&nbsp; up the scheme did not operate to wipe&nbsp; out or obliterate the legal consequence of their act—the forfeiture of the merchandise.<br><br>IV.&nbsp; Citing&nbsp; American&nbsp; jurisprudence, petitioners&nbsp; also urge that&nbsp; their&nbsp; acquittal&nbsp; in the criminal case bars the forfeiture of the articles in another proceeding where the issue as&nbsp; a cause for&nbsp; such forfeiture is the same act&nbsp; or fact involved in the criminal prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may&nbsp; be stated in this connection that&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; were&nbsp; charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila of having "wilfully and&nbsp; unlawfully manifested by overt acts&nbsp; their desire&nbsp; to export 144 pieces of gold&nbsp; bars&nbsp; (only 138&nbsp; were deposited with and duly receipted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Insular Treasurer)&nbsp; from the Philippines to&nbsp; Japan", in violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Central Bank's Circulars Nos. 21 and 42, in relation to Section 32 of the Central Bank's Charter&nbsp; (R,A.&nbsp; 265).&nbsp; In acquitting them, #ie Court of Appeals declared that "the&nbsp; omission to secure such license cannot&nbsp; be penalized unless it is consummated". It is clear that although the act upon&nbsp; which the seizure proceedings were based may be the same as that involved in the criminal action, the provisions of the Administrative Code under which&nbsp; the articles are being confiscated specifically include attempts.&nbsp; Under the latter statute, therefore, it is not necessary that the offense be completely executed as required under the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Central Bank circulars; it is sufficient&nbsp; that all the&nbsp; elements of an attempted exportation, as in the case at bar, are present. Consequently, acquittal under&nbsp; the latter legal provisions does not constitute a bar to forfeiture&nbsp; proceedings under the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code.<br><br>Wherefore, and&nbsp; on the strength of the foregoing consideration, the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals sought to be reviewed is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></m-l)  ></div>
