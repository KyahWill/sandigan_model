				<H3>PETITION  FOR  CANCELLATION  OF  ENCUMBRANCE.   BENJAMIN GEONANGA, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. C.  N. HODGES, RESPONDENT AND  APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondent,  C. N.  Hodges, seeks a  review, by  writ of error, of an order of  the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, granting a  petition  of  Benjamin  Geonanga and  Emilio Gotera for  an order  directing the  Register of  Deeds of Iloilo to cancel attachment and levy Entry No.  11336  on Transfer Certificate of Title No.  8981 of Iloilo, covering Lots  Nos.  430  and 855 of Cadastral  survey of  Iloilo. <br><br>Said lots were formerly covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3016, in the name of the spouses  Raymundo Robles and Margarita Mondejar.  On August 8,1949, these spouses  borrowed from the  Agricultural and  Industrial Bank a sum of money, and, to guarantee its payment, they constituted, in favor of said Bank a real estate mortgage on  the lots above  referred to.  Thereafter,  the owner's duplicate of said Transfer Certificate of Title  No. 3016 was held by  the Bank.   Sometime  in 1954, respondent herein, C. N.  Hodges,  as plaintiff in Civil Case No. 3172 in the Municipal Court of  Iloilo,  entitled "C. N. Hodges, plaintiff vs. Lourdes Robles, et al.,  defendants", secured a writ  of attachment,  which was  levied  upon the lots in question,  by  filing  the  corresponding  papers   with the Register of Deeds of Iloilo, who made said entry  No.  11336, on August 11, 1954, on the original of the aforementioned Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3016.<br><br>Subsequently, or on June 22, 1955, with  the express consent of  the  Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, the legal successor of the Agricultural and Industrial  Bank, herein  petitioners, Benjamin Geonanga and Emilio Gotera, paid the Bank the obligation of Robles and Mondejar and bought  said lots from them.   Consequently, the  Register of Deeds of Iloilo cancelled Transfer Certificate  of Title No. 3016, and issued,  to  Geonanga and Gotera, Transfer Certificate of Title No.  8981, with the corresponding memorandum of said attachment and levy in favor of Hodges, which did not appear on  the owner's duplicate of Transfer Certificate  of  Title No.  3016 held by  the Bank.  Hence, the petition of Geonanga and Gotera, dated June 27, 1955, for the cancellation  of said entry, annotation and memorandum, upon the ground  that the  same is  illegal,  null and void, pursuant  to section 26  of  Commonwealth Act No. 459, which provides that: <br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Securities  on loans granted  by the  Agricultural and Industrial Bank shall not be subject to attachment</span> nor can they  be included in the property of insolvent persons or institutions, unless all debts and obligations  of the debtor to the  Agricultural and Industrial Bank have been <span style="font-style: italic;">previously</span> paid, including accrued interest, collection expenses and other charges."  (Italics ours.) </blockquote>The  petition was filed in the cadastral case in which the decree for  the  registration of Lots  Nos. 430 and 855 had been entered.  C. N. Hodges contested the jurisdiction of the lower court, sitting  as a court of land registration, to grant said  petition,  upon the ground that the issue therein raised is a  controversial one and should be threshed out, either in an ordinary civil action, or in Civil Case No. 3172 of the Municipal Court of Iloilo.  After due hearing, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo  issued an order, dated July 12, 1955,  overruling said opposition and granting the petition.  A reconsideration  of  this order  having  been subsequently denied, the case is now before us for review, upon the record on appeal filed by respondent Hodges. <br><br>It  is not disputed that,  under  section  112  of Act No. 496,  petitioners-appellees,  as registered  owners of  Lots Nos. 430 and 855,  may  petition the  court  having jurisdiction over the cadastral case in which  the decree of registration of said lots was entered, for such relief as may be proper  against  "any error * * * or mistake *  *  *  made in  entering a. certificate or any  memorandum therein," provided that  the  original  decree of registration  is not thereby  reopened  and  the  title or other interest  of  a purchaser holding a certificate for value and in good faith is not impaired without his  written  consent.  But, citing Bank of the P.I. vs. Ty Campo Sobrino  (57 Phil.,  801), Castillo vs. Ramos  (78 Phil.,  809), Gov't of the Philippines vs. Jalandoni  (44  Off.  Gaz., 1837), and Tangunan  vs. Republic of the Philippines  (94 Phil., 171;  50 Off.  Gaz., 115), appellant maintains that said legal provision may be applied only when there is "no substantial controversy", or  serious objection" and "there  in  unanimity among the parties" concerned. <br><br>It is not, and cannot be, denied,  however, that, pursuant to  section 26 of Commonwealth Act  No.  459,  Lots Nos. 430 and 855, were "not * * * subject to attachment" on August 11, 1954,  when the  disputed entry of attachment and levy was made, said lots being then mortgaged to the Agricultural and  Industrial Bank, as  security on a  loan granted  by this  institution. Moreover, under Rule  59, section 2,  of the  Rules  of Court, only  properties  "not exempt from execution"  may  be  attached.  In  making said  entry, the  Register  of Deeds  of Iloilo  committed, therefore, an "error * * * or mistake"  so clear and patent that not even appellant herein denies it.  Hence, it  may be said that "there is unanimity among the parties," and no "substantial  controversy" between them,  about  said error or mistake. <br><br>Respondent-appellant insists that the exemption, under section 26 of Commonwealth Act No. 459, has been established for the exclusive benefit of the Agricultural and Industrial  Bank;  that said provision  may  no longer be availed of, the mortgage in favor of the Bank having been cancelled  on or  about June 22, 1955; and that  "an attachment can only be discharged or dissolved by the Judge who granted the order."  We find no merit in this pretense. Pursuant to said  legal provision, properties mortgage to the Agricultural and Industrial  Bank, now the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, are "not subject to attachment" unless "all  debts  and obligations" in favor thereof have been  previously paid.  In the case at bar,  the credit of the Bank was settled <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> the entry in  question.   Apart from this,  said entry, if valid, would  <span style="font-style: italic;">retroact</span> to the  date thereof, or August 11, 1954, thus violating the spirit and purpose  of the  aforementioned  section  26.  Moreover, having been made against a "mandatory or prohibitory" provision of law,  the aforemention  entry  was,  and is, "void"  (Article  5,  Civil   Code  of the Philippines),  not merely voidable, and may, accordingly, be assailed by  any party adversely affected thereby, such as petitioners herein. Again, by virtue of the payment  of  the  debt due to  the Bank, with the consent of the latter, and that of its debtors and original owners  of Lots Nos. 430 and 855, petitioners herein  are presumed to  be legally subrogated  into the rights of said creditor Bank, <span style="font-style: italic;">not only against its former debtors, but, also, "against third persons."</span>   (Articles 1237, 1302  and  1303,  Civil Code of the  Philippines.)   Lastly, a dissolution of the writ of attachment issued by the Municipal Court of Iloilo is not sought in the present case.  The only issue before us is  the validity  of  the  <span style="font-style: italic;">entry</span>, memorandum or annotation of said attachment in the  transfer certificate  of  title  covering Lots Nos. 430  and  855.  In short, petitioners'  right  to  the relief  prayed  for  is  indubitable and appellant's objection thereto  is not "serious" enough,  from a legal  viewpoint, to bar the exercise of the authority granted in  section 112 of Act No. 496. <br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with cost against appellant, C. N. Hodges.  It is  so  ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B.
