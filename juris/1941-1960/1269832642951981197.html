				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant stands accused of treason, committed between December, 1944, and 
January, 1945, in the Province of Laguna, on only one count alleged in the 
information as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about December 20, 1944, the accused, a member of the Ganap, a 
subversive pro-Japanese organization, joined the Pampars, a military 
organization supporting the Imperial Japanese Army and designed to bear arms 
against the army of the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
and the guerrillas in the Philippines; that he was equipped with a 1903 
Springfield rifle, caliber 30, and was made to undergo 10 days training, 
consisting of military <i>drill</i>, manual of arms, and target practice; and 
that from or about January 12, 1945 to March 15, 1945, the said accused was 
assigned to guard duty once a week; that he was armed with a rifle with orders 
to shoot any of the Filipino prisoners whom he was guarding who might attempt to 
escape and also any guerrilla or American soldier who might approach the 
Japanese garrison."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lower court found him guilty and sentenced him to <i>reclusion 
perpetua</i>, with the accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay a fine of 
P10,000 and the costs.</p>
<p>Three witnesses testified for the prosecution.</p>
<p>Tomas C. Serrano, 46, farmer, resident of Siniloan, Second Lieutenant in the 
Marking's guerrilla organization, testified that in December, 1944, he saw the 
accused in the Japanese garrison in Siniloan, "he was a member of the 
<i>Makapili</i> organization;" "he was doing guard duty, with a rifle, with a 
bayonet at his side;" "he was at the entrance of the garrison and he made all 
civilians passing through the entrance bow to him." If they did not bow, "he 
dragged them by the arms and brought them to the captain of the garrison;" he 
served as guard "since November, 1944, when the Japanese garrison was 
established in Siniloan, up to the time I was arrested on March 25, 1945;" he 
saw the accused on guard duty in the garrison "many times;" "I often saw him 
confiscating foodstuffs such as rice, fruits, <i>calabasa</i>, and other 
vegetables, for the support of the Japanese soldiers;" " he was with arms 
accompanied by Japanese soldiers and other members of the Makapili;" "I often 
saw him accompanied by Japanese soldiers and other <i>Makapili</i> members, 
arresting suspected guerrillas and sometimes they were patrolling or camping in 
the hideouts of the guerrilla forces, I cannot tell how many times, but I often 
saw him;" the witness was arrested on March 25, 1945, by Japanese soldiers and 
<i>Makapilis</i>, with whom the accused was; "the next morning we, the thirteen 
prisoners, were brought to the place where we were to be executed; but luckily 
while we were on our way to the barrio, the American planes came roaring, so the 
guards took cover;" "they were pulling the rope that tied us, and luckily I was 
able to slip away because I was the second to the last man in the line, and the 
rope was cut;" "I could not run fast because I was lame;" the rest were 
executed, naming the following: "Alejandro Serrano, Custodio Adaro, Emilio 
Javier, Peter Sardal, Elias Rodolfo, Ignacio Cavano, Beato Optis, Napoleon 
Pagtakhan, <i>Bienvenido Agapangan, and myself</i>;" Miguel Palma "was in my 
back to the last, so we two remained, and Pacifico (Adopina) remained untied" 
because he was carrying food, and when the Japanese ran, "he escaped." Asked to 
explain how he knew about the lot of those who were executed, the witness said 
that he went home when the town was liberated, and he visited the place "because 
I know the place," and when he reached the spot "I smelled very bad odor, and I 
recognized the soil which swelled, so I said to myself that this is the place 
where our son was buried;" "I went home and told the other parents of the 
victims" about the spot; "the next month, about thirty days," the witness and 
the other parents requested the municipal authorities to be allowed to exhume 
the bodies; when his son was being taken to the place of execution. "I had not 
seen him that time;" the witness based his knowledge as to appellant's being a 
<i>Makapili</i> on Exhibit A and he saw him armed, guarding the Japanese 
garrison, confiscating foodstuffs for the Japanese, and arresting guerrilla 
suspects in the town; Bienvenido Agapangan, one of those who were executed by 
the Japanese, "was the son" of appellant; "I cannot tell you whether he 
(appellant) was reporting to his officers any guerrilla;" Angel Javier and 
Custodio Adaro were arrested by a party of which the accused was a member, and 
"I know because he was with them when they were arrested;" the witness does not 
know whether the accused was present during the execution "because there was 
nobody present; only God had witnessed the killing of those persons."</p>
<p>Mauricio Adaro, 47, farmer, resident of Siniloan, testified that in December, 
1944, he saw the accused in the Japanese garrison in Siniloan; "he was mounting 
guard;" asked from what date to what date he saw him in the garrison, the 
witness answered that "I cannot remember the month in 1944 because we used to go 
out of Siniloan every time;" appellant "was getting food supplies from the 
civilians and giving them to the Japanese;" "the accused and the Japanese 
companions of his arrested my son (Custodio) in our house;" the witness was not 
arrested, "because I was able to hide;" he saw defendant mounting guard in the 
Japanese garrison "many times;" "more than ten times;" the garrison was located 
"in the school building."</p>
<p>Delfin Redor, 55, mayor of Siniloan, since 1937, testified that appellant 
"has been my barrio lieutenant;" he belongs to <i>Pampar Makapili</i> and 
<i>Pampar</i> and <i>Makapili</i>, "I believe are the same;" from December, 
1944, to March, 1945, the witness saw the accused "in the <i>Makapili</i> 
garrison, in the Siniloan plaza;" "I believe that he was a member of the 
<i>Makapili</i>;" "Sometimes he was detailed as guard in front of the garrison 
with arms and ammunitions—bayonet;" he saw him as such "many times;" the witness 
was not a mayor during the Japanese occupation because "in 1944, March, I 
escaped because, you know, I was wanted by the Japanese because I was also a 
guerrilla; before that, "I was a mayor of the town;" "during December, 1944, up 
to March, because, you know, I left the office, I was still in the town of 
Siniloan collecting some supplies for the guerrillas;" after abandoning the 
office of mayor, the witness "remained living in the <i>poblacion</i> of 
Siniloan;" he "never stopped living in the <i>poblacion</i>;" "I had three times 
seen the accused accompanied by the Japanese in raiding outside the 
<i>poblacion</i>;" the accused commandeered foodstuffs "and took them to the 
garrison for food;" "the Japanese garrison was in the Intermediate Building and 
the <i>Makapili</i> garrison is in Baybay Academy, about one kilometer distant;" 
the witness saw the accused "in Makapili garrison;" the witness was a captain of 
the guerrillas and was arrested by the Japanese four times, and in those 
occasions he did not see the accused in the garrison; the witness does not know 
of anybody who had been pointed out by the accused to the Japanese and was 
arrested by the same.</p>
<p>The Constitution provides that "in all criminal prosecutions the accused 
shall be presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved." (Article II, 
section 1 [17].) To overcome this constitutional presumption, the guilt of the 
accused must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The evidence presented by 
the prosecution in this case does not offer that degree of proof. None of the 
several overt acts alleged in the information has been proved in accordance with 
the two-witness rule provided in article 114 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>It is imputed to appellant, in the first place, that he is a member of the 
<i>Ganap</i>, "a subversive pro-Japanese organization," and "joined the 
<i>Pampar</i>, a military organization supporting the Imperial Japanese Army and 
designed to bear arms against the Army of the United States and the Commonwealth 
of the Philippines and the guerrillas in the Philippines." No witness has 
testified that appellant is a member of the <i>Ganap</i>. Only one witness, 
Redor, testified that appellant belonged to <i>Pampar</i>, but he did not 
testify as to its nature.</p>
<p>The next allegation of the information is that appellant "was equipped with a 
1903 Springfield rifle, caliber 30, and was made to undergo ten days training, 
consisting of military drill, manual of arms, and target practice." No evidence 
has been presented in support of this allegation.</p>
<p>The third allegation against appellant is that "from or about January 12, 
1945, to March 15, 1945, the said accused was assigned to guard duty once a 
week." The fourth and the last allegation is that "he was armed with a rifle 
with orders to shoot any of the Filipino prisoners whom he was guarding who 
might attempt to escape and also any guerrilla or American soldier who might 
approach the Japanese garrison." In connection with these two allegation, the 
only thing that the prosecution attempted to prove is that appellant did guard 
duty and was armed with a rifle. But the attempt does not meet the test under 
the two-witness rule.</p>
<p>The first two witnesses for the prosecution testified that they had seen the 
accused doing guard duty in the Japanese garrison in Siniloan "many times," more 
than "ten times," but neither of them has mentioned any specific time, day and 
hour. They were able to mention only years and months. There is no way of 
concluding that the two witnesses testified about the same overt act. The "many 
times" or more than "ten times" mentioned by them may refer either to two 
different sets of moments, not one instant of one set coinciding with any one of 
the other, or to only one and identical set of instances or, although referring 
to two sets, some of the instances are the same in both. As there is no basis on 
record upon which we may determine which, among the two alternatives, is the 
correct one, the doubt must be decided by taking the first alternative, the one 
compatible with the presumption of innocence stated in the fundamental law. The 
case for the prosecution is further weakened by the fact that its first two 
witnesses are contradicted by the third, who testified that appellant did guard 
duty "many times," more than "ten times," in the <i>Makapili</i> garrison, 
located in the Baybay Academy, one kilometer from the Intermediate School 
building, where the Japanese garrison was located.</p>
<p>To meet the test under the two-witness rule, it is necessary that, at least, 
two witnesses should testify as to the perpetration of the same treasonous overt 
act, and the sameness must include not only identity of kind and nature of the 
act, but as to the precise one which has actually been perpetrated. The 
treasonous overt act of doing guard duty in the Japanese garrison on one 
specific date cannot be identified with the doing of guard duty in the same 
garrison in a different date. Both overt acts, although of the same nature and 
character, are two distinct and inconfusable acts, independent of each other, 
and either one, to serve as a ground for conviction of an accused for treason, 
must be proved by two witnesses. That one witness should testify as to one, and 
another as to the other, is not enough. Any number of witnesses may testify 
against an accused for treason as to a long line of successive treasonous overt 
acts; but notwithstanding the seriousness of the acts nor their number, not 
until two witnesses, at least, shall have testified as to the perpetration of a 
single but the same and precise overt act, can conviction be entertained.</p>
<p>In justice to appellant, we feel it necessary to state that our decision to 
acquit him is not only based on the reasonable doubt we entertain as to his 
guilt, because the prosecution has not satisfied the requirements of the 
two-witness rule, but because we are rather inclined to believe his testimony to 
the effect that a guerrilla member, Vicente Auxilio, was caught by the Japanese 
in appellant's house, tortured and, finally, killed. For said reason, appellant 
was called by the Japanese, investigated, and then told to do some work in the 
garrison, otherwise he would have the same fate that befell Vicente Auxilio. "To 
save my life, I accepted the order and worked there," he testified, adding: "The 
Japanese, not being contented with my work, they got my carabao and on March, 
1945, they got my son, who was tortured and killed."</p>
<p>This son is the same Bienvenido Agpangan who, according to the first witness 
for the prosecution, was executed by the Japanese with several other victims. We 
do not believe that appellant could have adhered to the Japanese, the same who 
tortured and killed his own son. We do not believe that, in the absence of 
proof, he can be such a monster.</p>
<p>The decision of the People's Court is reversed and appellant is acquitted. He 
shall be released from the custody of the agents of the law upon the 
promulgation of this decision.</p>

<p>FERIA, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>The information filed against the appellant with the People's Court contains 
only one count to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about December 20, 1944, the accused, a member of the Ganap, a 
subversive pro-Japanese organization, joined the Pampars, a military 
organization supporting the Imperial Japanese Army and designed to bear arms 
against the army of the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
and the guerrillas in the Philippines; that he was equipped with a 1903 
Springfield rifle, caliber 30, and was made to undergo 10 days training, 
consisting of military <i>drill</i>, manual of arms, and target practice; and 
that from or about January 12, 1945 to March 15, 1945, the said accused was 
assigned to guard duty once a week; that he was armed with a rifle with orders 
to shoot any of the Filipino prisoners whom he was guarding who might attempt to 
escape and also any guerrilla or American soldier who might approach the 
Japanese garrison."</p></blockquote>
<p>From the above it clearly appears that defendant is charged with having 
committed only one overt act, that is, with having joined or become an active 
member of the Pampars, "a military organization supporting the Imperial Japanese 
army and designed to bear arms against the army of the United States and the 
guerrillas in the Philippines." The allegations "that he was equipped with a 
1903 Springfield rifle, caliber .30, and was made to undergo 10 days training 
consisting of military drill, manual of arms, and target practice," and that 
"from January 12, 1945 to March 15, 1945, the said accused was assigned to guard 
duty once a week," do not constitute two overt acts <i>separate and independent 
from the treasonous</i> or <i>over act</i> of joining and becoming an active 
member of said military organization named Pampars. Each one of those facts is a 
part and parcel of said treasonous act, since by becoming an active member or 
soldier of said military organization, the appellant must have necessarily been 
armed, undergone training and done guard duty.</p>
<p>In the case of People<i> vs</i>. Alarcon, G. R. No. L-407,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> already decided by this Court the defendant 
appellant Alarcon was charged with the crime of treason consisting, according to 
the information, of several overt acts alleged separately in several counts. In 
the first count he was charged with having joined and acted as a member of the 
pro-Japanese military organization named <i>Makapili</i>; and in the fourth with 
having retreated in December 1944 with the Japanese forces towards Bongabong, 
Nueva Ecija, before the arrival of the American forces in Cabanatuan. This Court 
in a decision unanimously concurred in by all the members who voted, including 
the Justice who pens the decision of the majority in this case, held that "the 
acts alleged in the fourth count constitute only a part of the overt act charged 
in the first count, since the appellant, as one of the members of said 
<i>Makapili</i> organization, had to retreat with the Japanese soldiers and 
other <i>Makapilis</i> to the mountains."</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, it is plain that the following fundamental 
conclusion in the majority decision is erroneous and misleading. The conclusion 
says: "The treasonous overt act of doing guard duty in the Japanese garrison on 
one specific date can not be identified with the doing of guard duty in the same 
garrison on a different date. <i>Both overt acts</i>, although of the same 
nature and character, <i>are two</i> distinct and inconfusable <i>acts 
independent of each other</i>, and <i>either one, to serve as a ground for 
conviction</i> of an accused for treason, must be proved by two witnesses." We 
say that it is erroneous and misleading, because the mere act of doing guard 
duty in a Japanese garrison, independent from that of being a member of the 
Japanese Army or a military organization of Filipino civilians and allied with 
the Japanese forces, does not of itself constitute an overt act. Doing guard 
duty in a Japanese garrison on a specific date, and standing guard in the same 
or another Japanese garrison on a different date, are but parts or bits of the 
continuous treasonous act of being an <i>active</i> member of such organization. 
The mere acceptance of a commission in a traitorous army is not sufficient to 
constitute overt act of treason. To be so, there must be at least an attempt to 
act as such. (U.S. <i>vs</i>. Manalo, 6 Phil., 364; U.S. <i>vs</i>. Villariño, 
5 Phil., 697; U.S. <i>vs</i>. De los Reyes, 3 Phil., 349; U.S. <i>vs</i>. 
Magtibay, 2 Phil., 703.)</p>In view of the failure on the part of the 
prosecution to establish the treasonous overt act, and of each part or bit 
thereof charged in the information against the appellant, by the testimony of at 
least two witnesses, the decision of the People's Court appealed from is 
reversed and the appellant acquitted. So ordered.<br><br><br>
