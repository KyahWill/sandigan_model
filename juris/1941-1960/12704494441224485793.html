				<H3>J.A. SISON, PETITIONER, VS. THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY AND ROBERT ORR FERGUZON, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In his petition for certiorari against the Board of Accountancy 
and Robert Orr Ferguson, J. A. Sison prays that this Court render judgment 
"ordering the respondent Board of Accountancy to revoke the certificate issued 
to Robert Orr Ferguson, a British subject admitted without examination because 
there does not exist any reciprocity between the Philippines and the United 
Kingdom regarding the practice of accountancy."
<p align="justify">Upon perusal of the pleadings and for a clear understanding of 
the issue raised by petitioner the following facts, which we believe are not 
disputed, shall be stated:</p>
<p align="justify">Pursuant to the provisions of Act No. 3105 as amended by 
Commonwealth Act No. 342, several persons, British subjects, and the possessors 
of certificates as chartered accountants issued by various incorporated private 
accountants' societies in England and other parts of the British Empire, were, 
without examination, granted by the respondent Board of Accountancy, 
certificates as public accountants to practice their profession in this 
jurisdiction. The respondent Robert Orr Ferguson was granted certificate No. 
713-W on January 14, 1939 pursuant to resolution No. 24 of the Board of 
Accountancy, series of 1938.</p>
<p align="justify">Subsequently, the Board of Accountancy, upon the examination of 
the case of those British accountants who were registered as certified public 
accountants without examination, came to the conclusion that, there being no law 
which regulates the practice of accountancy in England, and that the practice of 
accountancy in said country being limited only to the members of incorporated 
private accountants' societies, the certificates issued by the institute of 
chartered accountants and other similar societies in England and Wales cannot be 
considered on a par with the public accountants' certificates issued by the 
Philippine Board of Accountancy, which is a government entity. In view thereof, 
the respondent Board of Accountancy "resolved to suspend, * * * the validity of 
the C.P.A. certificates of the above-mentioned candidates pending the final 
revocation thereof should they fail to prove to the satisfaction of the Board 
within sixty days' notice that: (<em>a</em>) Filipinos are allowed to take the 
professional accountant examination given by the British government, if any, and 
(<em>b</em>) Filipino certified public accountants can, upon application, be 
registered as chartered accountants or granted similar degrees by the British 
Government." (Annex B.)</p>
<p align="justify">Such action of the Board of Accountancy was based on an opinion 
rendered by the Secretary of Justice, on October 1, 1946 (Annex A), to the 
effect that the certificate issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
England and Wales does not meet the requirement of section 41 of Rule 123 of the 
Rules of Court and that the negative statement therein, as quoted above, does 
not establish the existence of reciprocity, which induced the board to hold that 
the registration, without examination, of those British subjects as certified 
public accountants, is in accordance with the provisions of section 12 of Act 
No. 3105 as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 342.</p>
<p align="justify">However, the Secretary of Justice, answering a query from the 
Secretary of Finance, in an opinion rendered on February 10, 1947 "on the 
legality of the suspension or revocation" of the certificates issued to those 
British subjects as contemplated in resolution No. 5, series of 1946 of the 
Board of Accountancy, was of the opinion that the board may not suspend or 
revoke the certificates previously granted to the ten British accountants herein 
involved, including respondent Robert Orr Ferguson, because such action is in 
contravention of section 13 of Act No. 3105 as amended which explicitly provides 
that the suspension or revocation of a certificate issued under the said Act may 
be done by the board <em>for unprofessional conduct of the holder or other 
sufficient cause</em>. The Secretary of Justice further said that he believes 
that "the change in administrative interpretation with respect to the existence 
of reciprocity between the Philippines and Great Britain as to the practice of 
accountancy," does not constitute sufficient cause for the suspension or 
revocation of the certificates in question within the meaning of said provision. 
The opinion of the Secretary of Justice further said that if those certificates 
were issued to those British persons on the assumption that there is 
"reciprocity between Great Britain and the Philippines as to the practice of 
certified public accountancy in the Philippines" a change of administrative 
interpretation is not favored (42 Am. Jur., 412). While in the instant case the 
public policy with respect to the practice of foreign accountants in this 
country remains unchanged, the action intended by the Board of Accountancy, to 
suspend or revoke the certificates already issued to such persons must be based 
on some other grounds, such as ignorance, incapacity, deception or fraud on the 
part of the holder of the certificate.</p>
<p align="justify">In the light of the above, the petitioner brought this action 
mainly on the ground that there is no reciprocity "between the Philippines and 
the United Kingdom" as regards the practice of the profession of certified 
public accountant, because the certificate submitted by respondent Robert Orr 
Ferguson "is not a public or official record, and does not meet the requirements 
of section 41, Rule 21 [123] of the Rules of Court." And that furthermore, the 
negative statement that "there is nothing in the laws of the United Kingdom to 
restrict the right of a Filipino certified public accountant to practice as 
professional accountant therein," does not establish the existence of 
reciprocity.</p>
<p align="justify">Section 12 of Act No. 3105, as amended, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 12. Any person who has been engaged in the professional 
accountancy work in the Philippine Islands for a period of five years or more 
prior to the date of his application, and who holds certificates as certified 
public accountant, or as chartered accountant, or other similar certificates or 
degrees in the country of his nationality, shall be entitled to registration as 
certified public accountant and to receive a certificate of registration as such 
certified public accountant from the Board, <em>Provided</em> such country or 
state does not restrict the right of Filipino certified public accountants to 
practice therein or grants reciprocal rights to Filipinos, and provided that 
application for their registration shall be filed with the Board not later than 
December 31, 1938."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">From the text of the above-quoted section 12 of the Accountancy 
Law, it is inferred that the registration as certified public accountant and the 
issuance of the corresponding certificate as such certified public accountant, 
to a person who for five years has been engaged in professional accountancy work 
in the Philippines and is a holder of a certificate as certified public 
accountant, or as a chartered accountant, or other similar degrees in the 
country of his origin, is predicated on the fact that the country of origin of 
such foreign applicant (<em>a</em>) "does not restrict the right of Filipino 
certified public accountants to practice therein," (<em>b</em>) "grants 
reciprocal rights to Filipinos," and (<em>c</em>) the application for 
registration "be filed with the Board not later than December 31, 1938."</p>
<p align="justify">In the case at bar, while the profession of certified public 
accountant is not controlled or regulated by the Government of Great Britain, 
the country of origin of respondent Robert Orr Ferguson, according to the 
record, said respondent had been admitted in this country to the practice of his 
profession as certified public accountant on the strength of his membership of 
the Institute of Accountants and Actuaries in Glasgow (England), incorporated by 
Royal Charter, 1855. The question of his entitlement to admission to the 
practice of his profession in this jurisdiction, does not, therefore, come under 
reciprocity, as this principle is known in International Law, but is included in 
the meaning of comity, as expressed in the alternative condition of the proviso 
of the above quoted section 12 which says: <em>such country or state does not 
restrict the right of Filipino certified public accountants to practice 
therein</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<em>Mutuality, reciprocity, and comity as bases or 
elements</em>.â€”International Law is founded largely upon mutuality, reciprocity, 
and the principle of comity of nations. Comity, in this connection, is neither a 
matter of absolute obligation on the one hand, nor of mere courtesy and good 
will on, the other; it is the recognition which one nation allows within its 
territory to the acts of foreign governments and their tribunals, having due 
regard both to international duty and convenience and to the rights of its own 
citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws. The fact 
of reciprocity does not necessarily influence the application of the doctrine of 
comity, although it may do so and has been given consideration in some 
instances." (30 Am. Jur,, 178; Hilton vs. Guyot, 159 U.S., 113, 40 Law. ed., 
95; 16 S. Ct., 139.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In Hilton vs. Guyot (<em>supra</em>), the highest court of the 
United States said that comity "is the recognition which one nation allows 
within its territory to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts of another 
nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the 
rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of 
its laws." Again, in Bank of Augusta vs. Earle, 38 U. S., 13 Pet. 519, 589, 
Chief Justice Taney, speaking for the court while Mr. Justice Storyâ€”well-known 
author of the treatise on Conflict of Lawsâ€”was a member of it, and largely 
adopting his words, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"* * * It is needless to enumerate here the instances in which 
by the general practice of civilized countries, the laws of the one will, by the 
comity of nations, be recognized and executed in another, where the rights of 
individuals are concerned * * * The comity thus extended to other nations is no 
impeachment of sovereignty. It is the voluntary act of the nation by which it is 
offered, and is inadmissible when contrary to its policy, or prejudicial to its 
interest. But it contributes so largely to promote justice between individuals, 
and to produce a friendly intercourse between the sovereignties to which they 
belong, that courts of justice have continually acted upon it, as a part of the 
voluntary law of nations * * * It is not the comity of the courts, but the 
comity of the nation, which is administered and ascertained in the same way, 
and guided by the same reasoning, by which all other principles of municipal law 
are ascertained and guided."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The record shows that the British Minister accredited to the 
Philippine Republic in two notes concerning this question, addressed to the 
President of the Philippines in his capacity as Head of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"* * * there is no governmental control of the accounting 
profession in the United Kingdom and any resident of the United Kingdom, of 
whatever nationality, may engage in the profession of accounting without 
formality; and * * * that the high standards of the accounting profession in the 
United Kingdom are maintained by a number of private societies whose membership 
is restricted to persons who have passed a different professional examination 
but impose no restriction whatsoever on membership with respect of nationality." 
(Note of November 5, 1946.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Again, the British Minister, in his note of April 15, 1947, 
further said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Your Excellency will recall that doubt had been expressed by 
the Philippine authorities concerned as to whether qualified public accountants 
would be allowed to practice income tax accounting in the United Kingdom. 
Accordingly, I requested a ruling on this point, and I am happy to inform Your 
Excellency that I have been authorized by His Majesty's Principal Secretary of 
State for Foreign Affairs to state, for the information of the Government of the 
Philippines, that qualified Phillippine citizens are allowed to practice the 
profession of accountancy, including income tax accounting, in the United 
Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We are bound to take notice of the fact that the Philippines 
and the United Kingdom, are bound by a treaty of friendship and commerce, and 
each nation is represented in the other by the corresponding diplomatic envoy. 
There is no reason whatsoever to doubt the statement and assurance made by the 
diplomatic representative of the British Government in the Philippines, 
regarding the practice of the accountancy profession in the United Kingdom and 
the fact that Filipino certified public accountants will be admitted to practice 
their profession in the United Kingdom should they choose to do so.</p>
<p align="justify">Under such circumstances, and without necessarily construing 
that such attitude of the British Government in the premises, as represented by 
the British Minister, amounts to reciprocity, we may at least state that it 
comes within the realm of comity, as contemplated in our law.</p>
<p align="justify">It appearing that the record fails to show that the suspension 
of this respondent is * * * based on any of the causes provided by the 
Accountancy Law, we find no reason why Robert Orr Ferguson, who had previously 
been registered as certified public accountant and issued the corresponding 
certificate which authorizes him to practice his profession as certified public 
accountant in the Philippine Islands, should be suspended from the practice of 
his profession in these Islands.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is denied, with costs. <br><br><em>Moran, C.J., 
Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor,</em> and <em>Reyes, 
JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
