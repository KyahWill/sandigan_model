				<H3>ANDRES SANTOS AND FELIPE SANTOS,  PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE NUMERIANO  G. ESTENZO,  ETC.,  ET  AL., RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On October  26,  1952, Felipe Cabalde, a  driver  of the People's Land  Transportation Company,  of which Andres Santos and Felipe, Santos—hereafter  referred to as petitioners—are manager  and proprietor,  respectively, died in consequence of injuries sustained by him as the strong current of the Bao river that  flooded the municipality of Cananga, province of Leyte, in consequence  of a typhoon, washed away the car he was  driving.  Soon thereafter, his widow, Gloria Montederamos, filed, in her behalf and that of their four (4) minor children, with the Department of Labor the corresponding claim for compensation, which was not controverted by said petitioners.   After appropriate proceedings on August 4, 1953, the Workmen's Compensation  Commission  awarded  to  the   claimants P3,494.40,  plus burial expenses  not exceeding P200.00.</p>
<p>No appeal  having been taken from the award, on October 21, 1954, the mother of the deceased, namely, Manuela H. de Cabalde—one of  the respondents herein—acting in representation  of said minors, who were under her custody, instituted Civil Case No. 18-0 of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, with a petition for enforcement of said award, which was contested by petitioners herein,  as respondents in said case, upon several grounds.  For reasons not set forth in the record,  the case was not set for hearing until July 21, 1958.  Shortly before this date, or on July 17, 1958, petitioners  herein moved for postponement, upon the ground that  their counsel is the Justice of the Peace of Pastrana,  Leyte, and that,  as such,  had  several  cases scheduled for hearing on Jully 21,1958, but the motion was denied on  July 19,  1958.  When the  case  was called lor hearing on July 21,  1958, neither the petitioners nor their counsel appeared. Upon  the introduction of the evidence for the heirs of the  deceased Felipe Cabalde, the Court of First Instance of Leyte, presided over by Hon. Numeriano G. Estenzo, Judge, one of respondents herein, rendered a decision sentencing  petitioners  herein  to pay  jointly and severally to said  heirs of the deceased the aforementioned sums of F3,494.40, and P200, with interest  thereon at the legal rate  from  August  4, 1953, until paid,  with costs, plus P500 by way fcf attorney's fees, in view  of petitioners' refusal  to comply with said award.</p>
<p>Said respondent Judge having subsequently denied a motion for reconsideration of petitioners herein,  the latter thereafter filed their "Notice of Appeal by Certiorari" to the Supreme Court.   After securing an  extension of time to file  their appeal bond, petitioners  instituted  the present action  for certiorari  against respondent  Judge  and  said heirs of the  deceased.   Petitioners  pray that  the decision rendered by  respondent Judge be either annulled  or modified, upon two  (2) grounds, namely:  (1) that the lower court had "lost jurisdiction to enforce the award in Workmen's Compensation cases"; and (2) that "there was grave abuse of discretion by said court."</p>
<p>The  first proposition is based upon section 1, Rule 11, of the Rules  of the Workmen's  Compensation Commission, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"As soon  as  a decision, order or award has  become final  and executory, the  Kegional Administrator or Commission,  as  the case may he, shall,  <em>motu proprio</em> or on motion of  the interested  party, issue a writ of execution requiring the  sheriff or other proper officer to whom it is directed to  execute said  decision, order or award, pursuant to Rule 39 of the Rules of Court of the Philippines."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is urged  that, pursuant to  this Rule, said Commission has authority to enforce  its own orders and awards, and that, accordingly, the court had no jurisdiction to render the decision complained of.  Such jurisdiction is conferred, however, by  section 51 of Republic Act  No. 772, reading:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Any party  in interest may file  in any court of  record in the jurisdiction  of  which the accident occurred a certified  copy  of a decision of any referee or  the Commissioner, from which no petition for review or appeal has been taken within the time allowed  therefor,  as the case may be,  or a certified copy of  a memorandum of agreement duly  approved by the Commissioner,  whereupon the Court shall render a  decree or judgment  in  accordance  therewith  and notify the parties thereof.</p>
  <p>"The decree or judgment shall have the same effect, and all proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same as though the decree or judgment had been rendered in a suit duly heard and tried by the  Court,  except that there shall  be  no appeal therefrom.</p>
  <p>"The Commissioner shall,  upon  application by the proper  party or the  Court before which such action is instituted,  issue a certification that no petition for review or appeal  within  the time prescribed by section forty-nine hereof has been taken  by  the respondent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners maintain that this provision must be deemed amended by said Rule, but such pretense is obviously devoid of merit, not  only  because said Commission cannot amend an act of Congress,  but,  also, because said Rule was promulgated on February 21,  1957,  or more than two (2) years and a half  after the lower court had acquired jurisdiction over the  main case.</p>
<p>With respect to the second proposition, petitioners rely upon section 6,  Rule 26 of said  Commission,  which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Counsels of claimants who recover compensation shall be allowed fees not exceeding 5 per cent in unappealed case, 7.5 per cent  in cases favorably decided by the Commission, or 10 per cent in cases appealed to the Supreme Court.  The decision of the hearing officer or the  Commission shall specify the amount of such fees."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners say that the sum of P500 awarded by respondent Judge as attorney's  fees  exceeds the rate  allowed  in this Rule.   However,  the same regulates the fee that may be awarded either in the Workmen's Compensation  Commission, or when the decision thereof has  been appealed to the  Supreme Court, It does not govern the fees allowable by courts of justice, in proceedings for the execution of the award of the Commission,  which are  governed by the Rules of Court, when the employer unduly refuses  to comply with  said award.</p>
<p>For  lack of merit, the  writ prayed for is hereby denied and the  petition herein dismissed, with costs against the petitioners.  It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,  Padilla, Bautista Angelo,  Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera,</em> and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
