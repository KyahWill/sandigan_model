				<H3>ABELARDO LANDINGIN, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. PAULO GACAD, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Plaintiff Abelardo Landingin is the owner of two fishing contraptions locally 
known as <em>parigdig</em> constructed in 1954, in Calpay Shoal, Municipality of 
Sual, Pangasinan for which he paid the municipal licenses thereof up to the year 
1955. In 1949, an ordinance was enacted and approved by the Municipal Council of 
Sual, limiting the distance of fish corrals to a minimum of 200 meters from each 
other. About January 3, 1955, defendant Paulo Gacad commenced the construction 
of a <em>parigdig</em> 10 meters from and at a place north and fronting the 
<em>parigdig</em> of plaintiff, nearer to the center of Calpay Shoal, thereby 
blocking the flow of fish locally known as "Armang" to plaintiff's 
<em>parigdig</em>. A committee appointed by the municipal Mayor of Sual to 
investigate the case, reported that defendant's <em>parigdig</em> was 
constructed within 10 meters from plaintiff's <em>parigdig</em>. As defendant 
insisted to continue with the operation of his <em>parigdig</em> the plaintiff 
filed an action for injunction in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan to 
compel the defendant to remove his <em>parigdig</em>. A writ of preliminary 
injunction was issued, commanding the defendant to desist from committing 
further acts tending to block, fully or partially, the flow of fish locally 
known as "armang" to the plaintiff's <em>parigdig</em>. On March 18, 1955, the 
trial court granted the motion to dismiss filed by defendant, based upon the 
ground that the complaint states no cause of action. The plaintiff appealed and 
in his brief alleged that the order of dismissal was erroneous.</p>
<p>The pertinent portions of Ordinance No. 9 of the Municipal Council of Sual, 
provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section. 1. License and Fees. The privilege of taking fish from the municipal 
waters other than erecting fish corrals, traps and other fishing tackles, 
operating fishponds, or oysters culture beds, or catching barigos fry shall be 
granted to persons qualified to pay all necessary fees promulgated by this 
ordinance, payment of the corresponding fees for the fishing apparatus used 
herein specified: Provided, that no fisherman or fishermen shall catch fish 
within 200 meters from a fish corral unless himself is the owher of the corral, 
provided further, that this fees herein which is an annual fee, may be paid 
quarterly, if so desired by the applicant:</p></blockquote>

<p>(Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Plaintiff-appellant claims that the case comes within the operation and 
purview of the above quoted ordinance, stating that (1) a <em>parigdig</em> is a 
fish corral; (2) The defendant has not secured the required license for his 
<em>parigdig</em>, and, therefore, is not entitled to the Court's protection, 
and (3) Granting, arguendo, that the ordinance does not embrace 
<em>parigdig</em>, in the distance limitations, the court, nevertheless, is 
called upon to determine the necessity of a reasonable distance between 
<em>parigdigs</em>.</p>
<p>There is no question in our mind that <em>parigdig</em> is not a fish corral. 
From the very ordinance just quoted, "fish corrals, baclad or pasabing," under 
(a), and "Salambao" or <em>parigdig</em>, under (c), are entirely distinct and 
separate items. If the intention of the municipal council was to consider fish 
corral and <em>parigdig</em> as the same fishing contraptions, it would have 
listed the two items together, inasmuch as they all have the same license fees, 
in one group. Moreover, Act No. 4003, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 471, 
defines fish corral as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A 'fish corral' or 'baclad' means a stationary weir or trap devised to 
intercept and capture fish, consisting of. rows or stakes or bamboo, palma brava 
or ether materials fenced with either split bamboo mattings or wire nettings 
with one or more enclosures usually with easy entrance but difficult exit, and 
with or without leaders to direct the fish to the catching chambers or 
pound."</p></blockquote>
<p>The alleged sketch showing the construction of <em>parigdig</em>, attached as 
Annex 'A' to the Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, submitted by 
plaintiff-appellant, is not before us. Counsel for plaintiff-appellant, however, 
described the <em>parigdig</em> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As can be seen in the sketch, parigdig constitutes two (2) identical 
structures 12 meters apart. Each structure is composed of two parallel posts, 5 
rows of posts parallel to each other,"- on top of which are joined bamboo 
railings similar to raft. Betwieen these two structures, a fishing net is hanged 
with a circumference of 50 meters, more or less, attached to four posts equipped 
with ropes and pulley to enable the net to be raised or lowered at 
will."</p></blockquote>
<p>This description of a <em>parigdig</em>, does not coincide with the 
description of a fish corral given in tne said Act No. 4003r which further 
strengthens the conclusion that a <em>parigdig</em> is not the same as a "fish 
corral". The failure of said ordinance to prescribe a distance limitation for 
contraptions other than fish corrals, shows the legislative intention of 
allowing the use of <em>parigdig</em> and contraptions, other than fish corrals, 
at any place the fisherman may choose, without regard to distance. In other 
words, one <em>parigdig</em> may be constructed and operated at a distance of 
less than 200 meters from another <em>parigdig</em>.</p>
<p>Having reached the above conclusion, it follows that the complaint must be 
dismissed, for failure to state a cause of action, irrespective of whether the 
defendant has or has no license to construct and operate a parigdig. At any 
rate, the municipality of Sual, and not the plaintiff, can take action for the 
enforcement of the ordinance in question. Regarding the necessity of determining 
and prescribing distances between <em>parigdigs</em>, so as to avoid chaos and 
confusion among fishermen, the plaintiff may make representations to the same 
Municipal Council to that effect.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera,</em> and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgement affirmed</em>. </p></div>
