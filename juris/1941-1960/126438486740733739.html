				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Elvira  Vidal Tuason  de  Rickards  is  the  owner  of a private subdivision located  at Sampaloc, Manila, with an area of 44,561.80  square  meters covered   by  Transfer Certificate of Title No. 40961 (Exhibit 13).  In 1954, the lots therein were leased  to various tenants  among whom were Bernardo  Manalang, Vicente de Leon and Salvador de Leon occupying  Lots Nos.  174r—C,  160  and 158, respectively.  As the  City of Manila allegedly increased the assessment of said land effective January 1, 1954, the administrator thereof  notified the  tenants  of the corresponding increase of the rentals of the lots therein, such that the rental for the lot occupied by Bernardo Manalang was raised from P36  to  80; the rental for Lot  No. 160 was raised from P10  to  P43.12; and from P24 to P51.24 for Lot No.  158.  The said tenants, however, insisted on paying the former rate, and  as the landowner  refused to accept  the same, the former  consigned them in court. <br><br>On April 27,  1954, Elvira  Vidal  Tuason de Rickards, assisted by her husband,  Jose A. Rickards, instituted with the Municipal  Court  of  Manila  Civil Case No. 31401 against Bernardo Manalang; Civil Case No.  31406 against Salvador de  Leon; and  Civil Case No.  31411  against Vicente de Leon, all  for ejectment.  Therein defendants filed separate motions to dismiss invoking the  provisions of Republic Act No. 1162, which was approved  on June 18,  1954.  The  matter was duly heard and on  July 14, 1954, the Municipal Judge of Manila issued an order denying the motions to dismiss and suspending the proceedings for 2 years from the enactment of Republic Act No.1162 or until further order from the Court. <br><br>On April 13,  1955, upon motion of the  plaintiffs, the Municipal Judge issued  an order  setting the cases for hearing on  the merits. Defendants tried  to  secure  a reconsideration  of the aforesaid order, but as their motion was denied,  they filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No.  26135) against the spouses Rickards  and the Judges of the Municipal  Court of Manila, alleging that the order of  the same Court of July 14, 1954,  already disposed of the action and determined  the rights of the parties. It was thus prayed that a writ  enjoining the respondent Judges from proceeding with  the  hearing of the cases be issued;  that said respondents be declared without jurisdiction to hear the same; and that the orders of Municipal Judge Estrella Abad Santos setting the case for hearing on the merits and the order of Acting Judge Sumilang Bernardo denying their motion  for reconsideration be set  aside and declared null and void. <br><br>To this petition, the respondent spouses filed their answer denying  some  of the  averments of the  same. And  as special defenses, it was contended that the order of July 14, 1954, did not settle the controversy  it being merely an interlocutory order, and as such could  not be reviewed by  a petition  for certiorari.  It was,  therefore, prayed that the petition  be dimissed and  the  Municipal Judges be ordered to hear the cases on the merits.<br><br>On February 6, 1956, the Court  of  First Instance of Manila dimissed the petition on the ground that the order of the inferior court was merely interlocutory in nature, and  that the statements  contained  in  the body  thereof were the basis of the court's  ruling, as embodied in the dispositive part thereof denying the motion to dismiss and suspending the proceedings  therein  for 2 years or  until further  order  from the court.  From  this decision, defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, but the  latter tribunal  certified  the  case to  Us  on the ground that it involves  only a question purely of law. <br><br>The  main  issue  presented  by the  instant action is whether  the  order of  the  inferior court of July 14, 1954, is interlocutory or not and consequently, whether the lower court erred in dismissing the petition  for certiorari  and prohibition  filed therein.  The aforementioned order of the Municipal  Judge  dated  July 14, 1954, is hereunder copied in full:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"ORDER <br></div><blockquote>"After  a thorough consideration of the Motion to  Dismiss and the opposition thereto, this Court  is of the  opinion  and so holds that  from the approval  of Republic Act No.  1162  no  ejectment  proceedings should be instituted  or prosecuted against any tenant or occupant and that the unpaid  rentals of the tenants, if any they have, shall  be  liquidated and shall be paid in 18,  equal  monthly installments from the date or time of liquidation and that the landlord cannot charge more than the amount  being charged or collected by  them from their tenants as of December  31, 1953. <br><br>"It is undisputed fact that the premises occupied by the herein-defendants  have  been  and are  actually  being leased to  tenants, for which reason it is  governed  by the provisions of the aforesaid Act.  But  inasmuch as  these three cases of  ejectment  have been instituted  before  the  approval of  said Act,  it  is the  considered opinion of  this  Court that its prosecution  should be suspended.  As to the motion to  dismiss same  is untenable and without  merit,  for if these  cases  of ejectment will be  dismissed as claimed by  the herein defendants, the  liquidation of the  unpaid rentals  could  not be carried  out effectively as provided by  said Act.  <br><br>"As to the unconstitutionality  of section  5  of the  Republic Act in question, the presumption is that same  is valid and constitutional until it is  declared otherwise by  the competent tribunal,  for which reason we  deem it our bounden duty to enforce the avowed policy of the Republic  of the Philippines, as expressed in said Act (Pastor Mauricio et al.  vs. Hon. Felix Martinez  et al., CA&amp;mdashG. R.  5114—R, promulgated January 31, 1952). <br><br>"WHEREFORE, this Court orders the denialof the motion to dismiss, and  the suspension of  the proceedings in the three above-entitled cases during the period of two years from the approval of Republic Act  No. 1162 or  until  further  order of this Court".</blockquote>We see no reason why the  ruling  of the lower Court should not be  affirmed.  The  order of the Municipal Judge of July 14, 1954, is clear enough to  call for any construction  or  interpretation, for  while it  opens  with the paragraph stating that it was  the opinion of the  court "and so holds that  from the approval of Republic Act No. 1162 no  ejectment  proceedings should be instituted",  etc.,  the dispositive portion of the order  decreed the denial of the motion to  dismiss which  was based  on the same  Republic Act  No.  1162.  And this  ruling is  understandable.  It appears that  the actions for ejectment were filed  before the  enactment of Republic Act No.  1162  and  conceivably under the general principle that laws can only be  enforced prospectively,  the  Municipal  Judge  for one reason  or another saw it fit  to suspend the proceedings for  quite a long period, probably with the expectation that the  question of the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 1162 might be in the meantime duly  passed upon. <br><br>It can be seen  from the foregoing that the issues presented in the ejectment proceedings were not settled thereby,  for precisely the motion to dismiss filed by defendants based on the provisions of  Republic Act No. 1162 was denied. Certainly,  said actions having  been merely suspended, and the  jurisdiction of the  court over said proceedings not having been assailed, the said court has the power to reopen the same for trial on the merits  in  order that the rights  of  the  parties  therein  could be finally determined.  It  is  argued, however, by  appellants that the  body of the order recognized  the  prohibition laid down by Republic Act No. 1162 against the institution of ejectment proceedings after the  effectivity of said Act. It  is an elementary  principle  of  procedure  that the resolution of the Court  on a given issue as embodied in the dispositive part of  the  decision or  order is  the  investitive or controlling factor that determines and settles the  rights  of  the parties and the questions presented therein, notwithstanding the existence  of statements or declarations in the body of  said  order that  may  be confusing.  In  the case at bar, considering  that the  dispositive part of the  order merely suspended the proceedings without touching on the merits of the case or disposing of the issues involved therein, said order cannot  be said to be final  in character but clearly  an interlocutory one which in this case  cannot  be the  subject of an action for certiorari.<br><br>Wherefore, and acting merely  on  the  question  of procedure submitted to Us by  the instant  appeal, We have to affirm, as We do hereby affirm, the order of the  lower Court dismissing appellant's petition for certiorari and prohibition.  Without  pronouncement as  to  costs.  It  is so ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon,  Padilla, Montemayor,  Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
