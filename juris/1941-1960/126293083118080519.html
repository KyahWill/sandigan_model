				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Bugsuk Lumber Company, Inc.,&nbsp; a&nbsp; domestic corporation with <i>field</i> office&nbsp; at&nbsp; Balabak,&nbsp; Palawan, and <i>principal</i> office at 703 San&nbsp; Fernando, Binondo, Manila,&nbsp; "was&nbsp; organized to: <br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; Comprar y&nbsp; vender maderas y&nbsp; para dedicarse, en general&nbsp; :i toda clase de negoeios sobre maderas;<br>(To buy and sell lumber and to engage In general, in any kind of business concerning lumber) ;<br>(b)&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp; del Gobierno o adquirir, en la&nbsp; forma permitia por la ley, concessiones madereras si&nbsp; el negoeio asi lo exige; <br>(To apply&nbsp; from the Government&nbsp; or to acquire&nbsp; in any manner permitted by law, lumber concessions&nbsp; if&nbsp; the business&nbsp; would&nbsp; so require) ;<br>(c)&nbsp; Aserrar maderas y comprar trozos de madera,&nbsp; en caso de que el negocio&nbsp; de&nbsp; la eorporacion lo&nbsp; exija;&nbsp; y<br>(To saw&nbsp; lumber and to buy logs,&nbsp; in ease the&nbsp; business of the corporation would&nbsp; so demand; and)<br>(d)&nbsp; Hacer&nbsp; toda&nbsp; clase de nogoews&nbsp; relacionados&nbsp; directa o indi rectamente con&nbsp; los fines&nbsp; para los euales se ha&nbsp; creado&nbsp; esta corporacion (Exhibit "A"),<br>(To make all kinds of&nbsp; business that may be directly or&nbsp; indirectly&nbsp; in line&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; purposes for which this corporation has been&nbsp; created).</blockquote>In&nbsp; 1951 and during&nbsp; the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarters&nbsp; of 1952, the Bugsuk Lumber Company made sales&nbsp; of lumber to several firms&nbsp; including&nbsp; Pio Barreto &amp; Sons,&nbsp; Inc., Go- tamco &amp; Sons, Co.,&nbsp; Basilan&nbsp; Lumber&nbsp; Co., Dy Pac &amp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc., Central&nbsp; Sawmill, Woodart Inc.,&nbsp; Felipe&nbsp; Yupangeo&nbsp; &amp; Sons, Inc.,&nbsp; Jacinto&nbsp; Music Store&nbsp; and&nbsp; P. E.&nbsp; Domingo&nbsp; &amp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc. (Exhibits B to&nbsp; B-23).<br><br>On October 10, 1952, the Office of the&nbsp; Treasurer of the City of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; sent&nbsp; a demand to&nbsp; the Company for the payment of the&nbsp; amount of P544.50&nbsp; for&nbsp; license&nbsp; fees corresponding&nbsp; to the years 1951 and 1952, and&nbsp; P40.00 for the necessary mayor's&nbsp; permit,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that said business firm&nbsp; was found&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sales&nbsp; of timber&nbsp; products without&nbsp; first securing&nbsp; the&nbsp; required&nbsp; licenses&nbsp; and permits&nbsp; pursuant to&nbsp; City&nbsp; Ordinances&nbsp; Nos. 3420, 3364 and 3000.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; C).&nbsp; The Company&nbsp; must have&nbsp; refused&nbsp; or failed to pay said&nbsp; imposts because&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 11, 1953, the City Fiscal of Manila filed a complaint against the Bugsuk Lumber&nbsp; Co., Inc.,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Court&nbsp; of Manila alleging, among&nbsp; others, that&nbsp; defendant Company sold at <i>wholesal</i>e to different lumber&nbsp; dealers in Manila&nbsp; during the&nbsp; 1st, 2nd, 3rd&nbsp; and&nbsp; 4th&nbsp; quarters&nbsp; of<br><br>1951 and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd quarters of 1952 different kinds of lumber for which it should have paid a quarterly license tax of P40.00 or a total of F280.00 as provided by Ordnance No. 3000, as amended; that during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters of 1951 and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters of 1952, defendant Company sold&nbsp; at&nbsp; retail to different firms lumber for which it should have&nbsp; paid a total amount&nbsp; of P215.00 for license fees and the mayor's permit of P20.00; that despite repeated demands, defendant Company&nbsp; refused and failed to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the same&nbsp; and therefore,&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that judgment&nbsp; be&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; ordering the defendant&nbsp; Company to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Manila the amount of P584.50&nbsp; representing license fees and mayor's permit fees, with legal interests thereon and surcharges and for such&nbsp; other relief&nbsp; as may be deemed just and equitable&nbsp; in the premises. <br><br>Defendant Bugsuk Lumber Co., Inc., filed an answer on October 12, 1953, contesting plaintiff's allegation that it sold&nbsp; lumber at wholesale&nbsp; transactions&nbsp; because what&nbsp; it actually sold were&nbsp; unprocessed&nbsp; logs;&nbsp; neither&nbsp; did it sell at retail because the timbers were delivered directly from the vessel to the lumber dealers,&nbsp; and set up the affirmative defenses that the Bugsuk Lumber Company was essentially a producer, having no lumber yard of&nbsp; any&nbsp; kind in Manila or elsewhere, nor kept a store where lumber or logs could be sold, and that its products&nbsp; (logs)&nbsp; were&nbsp; sold directly from&nbsp; the lumber concession to&nbsp; the&nbsp; dealers in Manila; that as such producer, it had paid the taxes required by law such&nbsp; as the ordinary&nbsp; Timber&nbsp; License&nbsp; fee, Privilege tax (producer), sales tax, forestry charges,&nbsp; reforestation fees, residence taxes, and the municipal licenses in Bugsuk, Palawan; that the taxes in the form of license and permit fees sought to&nbsp; be collected&nbsp; by the&nbsp; City would&nbsp; constitute double&nbsp; taxation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; for&nbsp; the dismissal&nbsp; of the complaint.<br><br>The&nbsp; record shows that the Municipal Court of Manila rendered judgment&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; and defendant Company appealed the case to the Court of First Instance of Manila based practically in the&nbsp; same arguments.&nbsp; On July 18, 1954, the Court of First Instance rendered decision holding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Company&nbsp; sold&nbsp; logs&nbsp; to&nbsp; various firms in wholesale and retail transactions and although&nbsp; defendant had&nbsp; no store or lumber yard in&nbsp; the City, this fact alone cannot&nbsp; destroy the findings&nbsp; of the inspector&nbsp; of the City Treasurer's Office&nbsp; that it sold logs&nbsp; to different&nbsp; buyers, in Manila; that the&nbsp; imposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the taxes in question did. not&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; double taxation&nbsp; and&nbsp; that. the&nbsp; municipal taxes sought to be collected&nbsp; by the City authorities were not&nbsp; excessive and, consequently,&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Company to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P584.50 plus legal interests and&nbsp; costs.<br><br>From this&nbsp; decision, therein&nbsp; defendant took the&nbsp; matter to this Court and in&nbsp; this instance&nbsp; alleged that&nbsp; the lower Court erred:<br><blockquote><ol><li>&nbsp; In holding that appellant is a wholesale dealer and.not a producer within the meaning of the tax ordinance;<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; In&nbsp; holding that appellant&nbsp; is a&nbsp; retail&nbsp; dealer&nbsp; and&nbsp; not a producer within the meaning of the tax&nbsp; ordinance; and<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; In&nbsp; holding that appellant&nbsp; is liable under the&nbsp; municipal or dinances&nbsp; imposing taxes&nbsp; in wholesale&nbsp; and retail dealers&nbsp; because defendant is not a dealer but a producer.</li></ol></blockquote>We could see from the foregoing set&nbsp; of&nbsp; facts that the only question at&nbsp; issue&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case is whether&nbsp; or not appellant,&nbsp; maintaining&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; principal&nbsp; office&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; Manila, receiving&nbsp; orders for&nbsp; its&nbsp; products&nbsp; and&nbsp; accepting&nbsp; in&nbsp; said office payments thereto, can be considered a dealer in this City and is, therefore, subject&nbsp; to the payment&nbsp; of the license tax and permit fees in&nbsp; question.<br><br>Appellant&nbsp; does&nbsp; not dispute the power of the Municipal Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City of Manila to&nbsp; enact Ordinance No.&nbsp; 3000 requiring wholesale and retail&nbsp; dealers to secure and pay the&nbsp; mayor's&nbsp; permit annually,&nbsp; neither does&nbsp; it contest the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ordinance&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 3364&nbsp; which&nbsp; contains&nbsp;&nbsp; the following provision:<br><blockquote>"Group&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Retail dealers&nbsp; in&nbsp; new&nbsp; (not' yet used)&nbsp; merchandise, which dealers are&nbsp; not yet subject to the payment of any municipal tax, such&nbsp; as; (1)&nbsp; Retail&nbsp; dealers in <i>General Merchandise</i> and (2) retail dealers exclusively engaged in the sale of electrical supplies; sporting goods;&nbsp; office&nbsp; equipment and materials;&nbsp; rice; textile including' knitted&nbsp; wares;&nbsp; hardwares, including&nbsp; glasswares;&nbsp; cooking utensils and' <i>consttaction material</i>;&nbsp; papers;&nbsp; books including' stationery:"&nbsp; (Ordinance&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 3364); </blockquote>nor of Ordinance No. 3420&nbsp; which provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 1. <i>Municipal Tax&nbsp; on wholesalers in General Merehandise</i>.â€” There shall be paid by&nbsp; every person, firm or corporation&nbsp; <i>engaging&nbsp; in business&nbsp; as wholesale dealer in general merchandise</i>, a municipal tax based on wholesales, or on&nbsp; the receipts of exchange value of goods sold, exchanged&nbsp; or transferred, in accordance with the following:"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ordinance No. 3420.)</blockquote>A dealer has been&nbsp; defined as:<br><blockquote>A dealer, in the common acceptation and, therefore, in the&nbsp; legal meaning of the&nbsp; word, is&nbsp; not one who buys to keep or makes to sell, but one&nbsp; who&nbsp; buys&nbsp; to sell&nbsp; again; the middleman between the producer and&nbsp; the&nbsp; consumer of&nbsp; the commodity&nbsp; (In&nbsp; re&nbsp; Hemming, 51 F. 2d 850).<br><br>It has been said that a dealer stands immediately&nbsp; between the producer and the consumer, and&nbsp; depends for his profit, not upon the labor&nbsp; he bestows on his commodities, but upon the skill and&nbsp; foresight&nbsp; with which&nbsp; he&nbsp; watches&nbsp; the markets (State vs.&nbsp; J. Watts Kearny &amp;&nbsp; Sons,&nbsp; 160 So. 77).</blockquote>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; light&nbsp; of the above&nbsp; definitions, appellant certainly does&nbsp; not&nbsp; fall within the common and ordinary acceptation of the word "dealer"&nbsp; for&nbsp; there"&nbsp; is&nbsp; no controversy&nbsp; as to the fact&nbsp; that what appellant sold was the produce&nbsp; of its concession&nbsp; in&nbsp; Palawan.'&nbsp; Even conceding1,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; that the lumber&nbsp; which appellant&nbsp; disposed of comes within&nbsp; the connotation&nbsp; of 'construction&nbsp; materials"&nbsp; (Group&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; Ordinance No. 3364)&nbsp; and of the term&nbsp; "general merchandise" (used in&nbsp; Ordinances Nos.&nbsp; 3364&nbsp; and&nbsp; 3420),;&nbsp; which&nbsp; was, defined as: <br><blockquote>"All articles&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to the&nbsp;&nbsp; payment of percentage&nbsp; taxes or graduated&nbsp; fixed taxes, but not articles subject to the payment of specific taxes under&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of the Internal Revenue Code. It shall also include poultry,&nbsp; livestock, fish and other&nbsp; allied products" (Ordinance No. 3420).</blockquote>We&nbsp; see no&nbsp; reason&nbsp; why&nbsp; a producer or manufacturer selling its own&nbsp; produce&nbsp; or&nbsp; manufactured&nbsp; goods&nbsp; would&nbsp; be considered a dealer just to&nbsp; make it&nbsp; liable for the corresponding dealer's tax,&nbsp; as is the&nbsp; case in the instant appeal.<br><br>Appellee, however,&nbsp; in asserting that appellant Company is a dealer relied&nbsp; on&nbsp; the case of Atlantic Refining Co.&nbsp; vs. Van Valkenburg, 265 Pa. 456;&nbsp; 109 A. 208, wherein it was held that the term dealer includes "one&nbsp; who carries&nbsp; on the&nbsp; business&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; selling- goods, wares&nbsp; and merchandise manufactured by him at a <i>store or&nbsp; warehouse apart&nbsp; from his own&nbsp; manufactory</i>", and it&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; contention of the City Fiscal that the office&nbsp; at 703 San&nbsp; Fernando, Binondo, Manila,&nbsp; where appellant&nbsp; received&nbsp; orders&nbsp;&nbsp; and receipted payment&nbsp; for&nbsp; such&nbsp; orders is actually a store.<br><br>Appellant&nbsp; admittedly maintained said&nbsp; principal&nbsp; office but&nbsp; averred&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; used merely&nbsp; to&nbsp; facilitate the payment&nbsp; cf the tax obligations of&nbsp; said Company, to receive orders&nbsp; of its timber produce&nbsp; and&nbsp; accept&nbsp; payments therefor,&nbsp; and not for any purpose connected&nbsp; with the business&nbsp; of buying" and selling.&nbsp; Did the fact that appellant received orders of its goods&nbsp; and accepted&nbsp; payments thereto in said office make such office a store?<br><br>Lexicographers&nbsp; defined a store as:<br><blockquote>Any&nbsp; plate where&nbsp; goods&nbsp; are kept for&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; whether by&nbsp; wholesale&nbsp; or retail;&nbsp; a shop (Webster's&nbsp; New&nbsp; International&nbsp; Dictionary, 2nd ed., p. 248G).<br><br>Any&nbsp; place&nbsp; where&nbsp; goods&nbsp; are deposited&nbsp; and&nbsp; sold&nbsp; by one engaged in buying&nbsp; and&nbsp; selling . them&nbsp; (Black's&nbsp; Law&nbsp; Dictionary,&nbsp; 4th ed., p. 1589). It was also said that:<br><br>A&nbsp; store&nbsp; is any place where goods are kept for&nbsp; sale&nbsp; or sold, whether by wholesale or&nbsp; retail&nbsp; (Standard Oil Co. vs. Green.,&nbsp; 34 F. Supp. 30).&nbsp; It also applies to&nbsp; a building&nbsp; or&nbsp; room in which goods of&nbsp; any&nbsp; kind&nbsp; or in&nbsp; which goods,&nbsp; wares and&nbsp; merchandise are kept for sale, or to any building" used for the sale&nbsp; of&nbsp; goods&nbsp; of any&nbsp; kind&nbsp; (Jackson. V.&nbsp; Lane,&nbsp; 59 A. 2d&nbsp; 662;&nbsp; 3 42 N. J.&nbsp; Eq. 193).</blockquote>It could be seen&nbsp; that&nbsp; the placing of an order for goods and&nbsp; the making&nbsp; of payment&nbsp; thereto&nbsp; at a principal&nbsp; office does&nbsp; not transform&nbsp; said&nbsp; office into&nbsp; a&nbsp; store,&nbsp; for it is a necessary element that there must also&nbsp; be goods or wares stored&nbsp; therein&nbsp; or on display, and provided&nbsp; also that&nbsp; the firm or person&nbsp; maintaining that office is actually engaged in the&nbsp; business&nbsp; of buying and selling.&nbsp; These&nbsp; elements are wanting in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar for&nbsp; it needs&nbsp; no further clarification that the principal office alluded to as a&nbsp; store only&nbsp; serves to&nbsp; facilitate the&nbsp; transactions&nbsp; relative&nbsp; to&nbsp; the sale of its&nbsp; produce, but does not act&nbsp; as a dealer or intermediary between&nbsp; its field office and&nbsp; its customers.<br><br>We may further&nbsp; add that this matter&nbsp; was already passed upon by this&nbsp; Court when,&nbsp; through&nbsp; Mr. Justice&nbsp; Alejo Labrador, it held that:<br><blockquote>"It&nbsp; may be admitted&nbsp; that the manufacturer becomes a dealer if he carries on the business&nbsp; of&nbsp; selling goods or the products manufactured&nbsp; by&nbsp; him&nbsp; at&nbsp; a store&nbsp; or&nbsp; warehouse&nbsp; apart from his&nbsp; own shop or manufactory.&nbsp; But plaintiff-appellee&nbsp; did not carry&nbsp; on the business of selling sugar&nbsp; at&nbsp; stores or at&nbsp; its warehouses.&nbsp; It entered&nbsp; into the contracts of&nbsp; sale at its central office in Manila&nbsp; and made&nbsp; deliveries of the sugar sold&nbsp; from its&nbsp; warehouses.&nbsp; It does not appear that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; keeps stores at its&nbsp; warehouses&nbsp; and engages in selling sugar in&nbsp; said stores.&nbsp; Neither does it&nbsp; appear that any one&nbsp; who desires to purchase sugar from&nbsp; it may .go to the warehouses&nbsp; and&nbsp; there purchase&nbsp; sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that&nbsp; it&nbsp; does&nbsp; was to sell&nbsp; the sugar it manufactured; it does&nbsp; not&nbsp; open&nbsp; stores for the sale of&nbsp; such&nbsp; sugar. Plaintiff-appellee&nbsp; did not,&nbsp; therefore, engage&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; business of&nbsp; selling&nbsp; sugar".&nbsp; (Central&nbsp; Azucarera de Don Pedro vs. City of Manila&nbsp; et al., 97 Phil., 627).</blockquote>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; and&nbsp; appellant declared exempt from the liabilities sought to be charged against it&nbsp; under the provisions of the aforementioned ordinances, without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A,, Bautista,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Conception,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B&nbsp; L.</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Endencia, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
