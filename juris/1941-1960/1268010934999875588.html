				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>This is a petition for habeas corpus filed by petitioner Teodoro Cantos 
(Teodoro Tatishi) against Lieutenant General Wilhelm D. Styer, Commanding 
General of the United States Army Forces, Western Pacific, upon the ground that 
petitioner is a Filipino citizen, residing in Hang, Davao City, and is now 
confined by order of the respondent at the residence of the High Commissioner in 
Manila, Philippines, with no legal cause whatsoever.
<p>Petitioner was born in Davao on December 7, 1913, his father being Japanese 
and his mother, Filipino. At the age of 27 he elected to become a Filipino 
citizen under the name of Teodoro Cantos, and was given Philippine citizenship 
by the Court of First Instance of Davao on September 17, 1938. On March 25, 
1946, he was indicted for war crimes before the military commission duly 
constituted by order of General Styer, respondent. The charges are as 
follows:</p>
<p align="center">"SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. In that Teodoro Tatishi, a Japanese civilian, and other persons connected 
and acting with Japan, did, at or near Tibungko, Davao City, Mindanao, 
Philippine Islands, on or about 28 December 1941, during a time of war between 
the United States of America, its allies and Japan, willfully and unlawfully 
kill Sixto Babao, Dalmacio Babao, Francisco Cobling and Martin Marquez, unarmed, 
non-combatant Filipino civilians, by striking them with a saber, and by shooting 
them, in violation of the laws of war.</p>
<p>"2. In that Teodoro Tatishi, a Japanese civilian and other persons connected 
and acting with Japan, did, at or near Hang, Davao City, Mindanao, Philippine 
Islands, on or about 7 January 1942, during a time of war between the United 
States of America, its allies and Japan, willfully, unlawfully and forcibly take 
and loot personal property of Justina Larracoecha Babao, in violation of the 
laws of war.</p>
<p>"Dated: 25 March 1946."</p></blockquote>
<p>The military commission, after hearing, found petitioner guilty of the 
charges and sentenced him to death by hanging.</p>
<p>There seems to be no question that petitioner is charged with war crimes 
before a military commission duly constituted. It is maintained, however, that 
the petitioner being a Filipino civilian when he allegedly committed the crimes 
charged and the Philippine courts being open and capable to administer justice, 
the military commission has no jurisdiction to try him. It is well settled that 
war crimes may be committed not only by lawful belligerents but by any "men and 
bodies of men, who, without being lawful belligerents" "nevertheless commit 
hostile acts of any kind." (Par. 351, Rules of Land Warfare). "Persons of the 
enemy territory who steal within the lines of hostile army for the purpose of 
robbing, killing, etc." are also war criminals subject to the jurisdiction of 
military commissions. (Par. 352, <em>id.</em> <em>id.</em>). And in the 
preamable to the Hague Convention it is declared that "until a more complete 
code of the laws of war has been issued, the High Contracting Parties deem it 
expedient to declare that, in cases not included in the Regulations adopted by 
them, the inhabitants and the belligerents remain under the protection and the 
rule of the principles of the law if nations, as they result from the usages 
established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity, and the dictates 
of the public conscience."</p>
<p>All this goes to show that war crimes may be committed by any person 
regardless of his nationality. Thus, the Supreme Court of the United States, in 
Ex garte. Quirin (317 U. S., No. 1 [Off. Rep. Sup. Ct.], pp. 37, 38), said that 
"citizenship in the United States of an enemy elligerent does not relieve him 
from the consequences of a belligerency which is unlawful because in violation 
of the law of war. Citizens who associate themselves with the military army of 
the enemy government, and with its aid, guidance and direction enter this 
country bent on hostile acts, are enemy belligerents within the meaning of the 
Hague Convention and the law of war." </p>
<p>Here, the petitioner is a Filipino citizen though of a Japanese father, and 
associating himself with Japan in the war "against the United States of itaerica 
and the Philippines, committed atrocities against unarmed and noncombatant 
Filipino civilians and looted Filipino property. He is, indeed, a war criminal 
subject to the jurisdiction of the military commission, and his confinement by 
the respondent is not illegal. (<em>In re</em><em></em> Yamashita, 66 Sup. Ct., 
340; 90 Law. ed., 499.)</p>
<p>It is argued that, by direction of the President of the United States of 
America, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Imerican Military Forces, on September 
12, 1945 5 instructed General Douglas MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the 
United States Army Forces, Pacific, to proceed with the trial before appropriate 
military tribunals of such Japanese war criminals as have been or may be 
apprehended, and that, therefore, the petitioner, who is a Filipino citizen, 
cannot be a Japanese war criminal subject to the jurisdiction of the military 
commission constituted under such presidential authority. There is before us no 
conclusive evidence that General Douglas MacArthur's authority is thus limited. 
At any rate, we believe that the military commission may look through the 
naturalization papers into the real nationality of a person with Japanese blood 
charged with war crimes. After due hearing the military commission found the 
petitioner to be a Japanese mestizo. The certificate of Filipino citizenship was 
issued in his favor after he had sworn to have renounced his allegiance and 
fidelity to Japan and pledged faith and allegiance to the United States of 
America and the Philippines. But there is evidence before the military 
commission to the effect "that during the war he was a member of the Japanese 
civilian army and committed atrocities against unarmed and noncombatant Filipino 
civilians. In his oath of naturalization he swore that he owned real property in 
the Philippines worth P1,200 as required by the Naturalization Law. It appears, 
however, from his sworn testimony before the military commission that he never 
owned any property in the Philippines. If the military commission believes, as 
it apparently does, that, by reason of the above circumstances, the petitioner 
never acquired Filipino citizenship or he already lost it, we certainly find no 
reason to interfere.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, petition is dismissed, without costs.</p><em>Paras,

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Respondent failed to appear in this case or to answer the petition for a writ 
of habeas corpus. </p>
<p>The main question in this case is whether the military commission set up by 
respondent under the authority of General HaoArthur, Commander-in-Chief, United 
States Army Forces, Pacific, has jurisdiction to try and convict petitioner for 
an alleged war crime, when petitioner is a naturalized Filipino citizen and not 
a Japanese.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Stone, in his majority opinion in the case of Yamashita 
<em>vs.</em> Styer (66 S. Ot. 540), speaking for the United States Supreme 
Court, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By direction of the President, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the American 
Military Forces, on September 12, 1945, instructed General Mac Arthur, 
Commander-in-Chief, United States Army Forces, Pacific, to proceed with the 
trial, before appropriate military tribunals, of such Japanese war criminals as 
have been or may be apprehended. By order of General Mac Arthur of September 84, 
1945, General Styer was specifically directed to proceed with the,trial of 
petitioner upon the charge here involved. This order was accompanied by detailed 
rules and regulations whioh General MacArthur presoribed for the trial of war 
criminals. These regulations directed, among other things, that review of the 
sentence imposed by the commission should be by the officer convening it, with 
authority to approve, mitigate, remit, commute, suspend, reduce or otherwise 
alter the sentence imposed, and directed that no sentence of death should be 
carried into effect until confirmed by the Command Chief, United States Army 
Forces, Pacific. </p></blockquote>
<p>From the foregoing, It is evident that the jurisdiction of the military 
commission is limited by the instructions given to General MacArthur, under 
whose authority the military commission has been set up, such jurisdiction not 
extending to any person except "Japanese war criminals".</p>
<p>It appearing from the record that petitioner Teodoro Cantos is a Filipino 
citizen, the military commission can not legally exercise jurisdiction over him, 
and all acts of said commission outside of its jurisdiction are null and 
void.</p>
<p>Judicial proceedings without or in excess of jurisdiction are without any 
legal effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Courts created by statute and not by the Constitution are tribunals of 
special and limited jurisdiction only. They can exercise only such powers as are 
directly- conferred on them by legislative enactment and such as may be 
incidentally necessary to the execution of those powers. Therefore, unless 
authority for the exercise of jurisdiction in a given case can be ound in the 
statutes, given either expressly or by necessary implication, their proceedings 
are void for the rule is that such a court can only take cognizance of such 
matters as are clearly within its jurisdiction." (14 Am. Jur. p. 369.) </p>
<p>"When a court or judicial officer exercises a special statutory power outside 
the scope of the usual jurisdiction of courts of general powers, the record of 
the proceedings must show that the statutory authority has been pursued." 
(Cowdrey <em>vs.</em> Town of Caneadea, 16 Fed. 532.)</p>
<p>"Where a court is exercising a special statutory jurisdiction, the record 
must show upon its face that the ease is one where the court has authority to 
act. Jurisdiction in such cases is never presumed, and if it does not appear the 
judgment will be void and subject to collateral attack. Rice <em>vs.</em> 
Travis, 216 111., 249, 74 N. E., 801; Payson <em>vs.</em> People, 175 111., 267, 
51 N. E., 588; Haywood <em>vs.</em> Collins, 60 111. 328. Whatever the rank of 
the court exercising a special statutory jurisdiction, it is governed by the 
same rules us courts of limited jurisdiction." (Cases cited) (Keal <em>vs.</em> 
Rhydderek, 148 N. E. 54).</p>
<p>"This Court has often held that, where jurisdiation is conferred on a court 
by special statute, which is to be exercised in a special manner therein 
prescribed, the record of such court must show the facts essential to give the 
court jurisdiction; otherwise no presumption as to its jurisdiction will be 
indulged. The statute in such oases, must strictly be pursued, and the 
jurisdiction must be made to appear in the mode pointed out by the statute. 
(Morris <em>vs.</em> Dooley, 59 Ark. 483, 28 S. W., 30 Hindman v. 0'Conner, 54 
Ark. 643, 16 S. W. 1058, 13 L. R.A., 490; Gibney <em>vs.</em> Crawford, 51 Ark., 
35, 9 S. W. 309, See, also, Cross <em>vs.</em> Wilson, 52 Ark. 312, 12 S. W., 
576; Lusk <em>vs.</em> Perkins, 48 Ark. 238, 2 S. W. 847." (Reeves <em>vs.</em> 
Conger, 147 S.W. 438, 439.)</p></blockquote>
<p>If petitioner is amenable to be prosecuted and convicted for any crime 
allegedly committed during the war, the proceeding can not take place before the 
commission set up by respondent, but before either a special tribunal with the 
proper jurisdiction or the ordinary civil courts of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Under the facts on reoord, petitioner is entitled to be discharged from 
confinement, sad we vote that the writ of habeas corpus prayed for be 
issued.</p>
