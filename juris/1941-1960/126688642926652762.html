				<H3>ROBERT  DENOPOL,  PETITIONER  AND  APPELLANT,  VS.  THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Bureau of Lands, Roberto Denopol and Emilio Junto disputed over. the&nbsp; possession&nbsp; and cultivation&nbsp; of&nbsp; a 29-hectare public land in Dimataling, Zamboanga del Sur. After proper investigation, the Director of Lands allotted 24&nbsp; hectares&nbsp; to&nbsp; Junto&nbsp; (by homestead) and 5 hectares to Denopol (by sales application).&nbsp; The latter appealed to the Secretary of&nbsp; Agriculture and Natural Resources,&nbsp; who in due .course confirmed the Director's award.<br><br>To the courthouse of that province resorted Denopol by petition for certiorari.&nbsp; However, realizing that the award rested on the finding&nbsp; of&nbsp; Junto's prior possession of and cultivation of the land apportioned to&nbsp; him, and that such factual&nbsp; finding&nbsp; of said administrative officials&nbsp; was&nbsp; final under the law,&nbsp; the judge declined to interfere, denied the petition.<br><br>Now we have this appeal, wherein Denopol imputes abuse of discretion to those executive officers, because according to&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; before&nbsp; them&nbsp; his possession&nbsp; antedated Junto's.<br><br>This appeal may not be sustained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Courts administer justice in accordance with the&nbsp; provisions of the&nbsp; statute applicable to the case;&nbsp; and sec. 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 expressly provides that decisions of the Director of Lands&nbsp; as to questions of fact involving lands of the public domain are final and conclusive&nbsp; when approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.&nbsp; In compliance with this directive, courts have uniformly held the factual determination of said officers to&nbsp; be&nbsp; conclusive upon them.&nbsp; They, however, recognize exceptions by general principles&nbsp; of jurisprudence; fraud, imposition or mistake other&nbsp; than error in estimating the value or effect of the evidence&nbsp; (Ortua <i>vs.</i> Singson&nbsp; Encarnacion, 59 Phil., 443). <br><br>Undoubtedly aware of the above views, petitioner Denopol asserted in the court below collusion between Junto and the&nbsp; investigators&nbsp; of the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands;&nbsp; but he failed&nbsp; to prove&nbsp; such&nbsp; assertion.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; also alleged that in such investigation, he had not been adequately represented by counsel nor given sufficient notice.&nbsp; On this point the Hon. Mateo&nbsp; Canonoy, District Judge, said that according to the record, there was sufficient notice, and although "it is true that&nbsp; he was not represented by a qualified member of the bar but he was assisted by a "procurador" or friend who served&nbsp; as his counsel and&nbsp; who&nbsp; cross-examined the witnesses&nbsp; of his opponent.&nbsp; The herein respondent -was not also represented by a qualified member of the bar.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the absence of counsel to assist&nbsp; any or both parties is not reversible error, since this was only an administrative proceeding."<br><br>We&nbsp; have no hesitation to indorse His Honor's view above stated.<br><br>In this&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; the principal&nbsp; contention of Denopol is that "the&nbsp; conclusions drawn&nbsp; from the facts&nbsp; found by the Director&nbsp; of Lands confirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture&nbsp; and&nbsp; Natural Resources are erroneous and not warranted by law."&nbsp; Then he proceeds at&nbsp; length to challenge this finding or that statement&nbsp; of the said officers, alleging lack&nbsp; of evidence or&nbsp; citing adverse testimony, inferences and exhibits.&nbsp; As&nbsp; indicated, in the&nbsp; Ortua case&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>} errors in estimating the value or effect&nbsp; of the evidence will not be gone&nbsp; into a&nbsp; proceedings like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; He may not, therefore,&nbsp; expect us to. rule&nbsp; on each&nbsp; and&nbsp; every flaw he discovers&nbsp; upon&nbsp; reading the evidence before those officials. It should be proper at this point to quote what the Department Head declared:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; * *&nbsp;&nbsp; Roberto Denopol presented&nbsp; his motion for reconsideration&nbsp; and&nbsp; reinvestigation with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands who&nbsp; denies the same&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; September 22, 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this order of the Director of&nbsp; Lands,&nbsp; Roberto Denopol&nbsp; has elevated the case on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to&nbsp; this&nbsp; Office,&nbsp; alleging as&nbsp; ground thereof, that he is entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; land&nbsp; in question&nbsp; by right of settlement because he has&nbsp; been in&nbsp; occupation&nbsp; thereof and&nbsp; had&nbsp; improved tile area before&nbsp; applicant-appellee came to&nbsp; the land in 1949; and that he would have been able to&nbsp; prove his assertion&nbsp; if he were present daring the ocular&nbsp; inspection&nbsp; of the premises conducted by a representative&nbsp; of the Bureau&nbsp; of Lands, but because the said&nbsp; ocular inspection was made in his absence, he was deprived of his&nbsp; right to properly establish his claim."<br><br>"A&nbsp; review&nbsp; of the records&nbsp; of this case shows&nbsp; that there is no merit in those allegations&nbsp; of the appellant&nbsp; because&nbsp; it has been shown that the ocular inspection of the premises in question was conducted&nbsp; by the representative of the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands&nbsp; in connection with the investigation of this case and&nbsp; in the presence of the contending parties; that the appellant had testified in the said investigation; presented&nbsp; his witnesses; that he had&nbsp; pointed out to the investigating officer&nbsp; the site of his&nbsp; pre-war&nbsp; house and&nbsp; also his clearings and cultivation in the land in question;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the investigating officer had found&nbsp; that the occupation&nbsp; and improvement of the appellant were confined on&nbsp; the&nbsp; portion&nbsp; awarded to&nbsp; him— Lot No. 74-"A", while the&nbsp; appellee is&nbsp; the occupant and cultivator of the major portion of Lot No. 74, which remains&nbsp; covered by his application***."<br></blockquote>And the Director of Lands found in his order of September 22, 1953:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp;&nbsp; * *&nbsp; In the&nbsp; ocular investigation, it was found that the major part of the contested land is 'cogonal', specially the portion allotted to respondent Junto where he&nbsp; has under actual cultivation to corn and rice quite a sizeable area;&nbsp; The&nbsp; alleged cultivation and improvements of claimant Denopol were&nbsp; found in the portion 74-"A" where respondent Junto also has some cultivation and&nbsp; two dwelling houses. There&nbsp; are 80&nbsp; coconut trees&nbsp; standing&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; portion&nbsp; planted by claimant Denopol as&nbsp; tenant of&nbsp;&nbsp; Alejandro Sumbria, according to Junto's witnesses, altho Denopol&nbsp; alleges that he planted them in Ms own right." <br><br>"Claimant Denopol has not filed any public land application&nbsp; and i? relying&nbsp; mainly upon his&nbsp; tax&nbsp; declaration.&nbsp; His oral&nbsp; evidence is not&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; to support his&nbsp; claim over the&nbsp; entire&nbsp; 29 hectares comprising the contested area, specially over portion 74 where he has no actual possession or existing improvements.&nbsp; His&nbsp; cultivation in portion 74-"A", even conceding his claim to&nbsp; the 80 coconut trees therein, is&nbsp; so&nbsp; insignificant as to&nbsp; justify a claim to the entire contested&nbsp; area.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp; the occupation of respondent Junto of the portion allotted to him and his actual cultivation&nbsp; of quite a big area therein, entitles him to acquire the said portion." .<br><br>From the facts gathered at the&nbsp; investigation, principally those found&nbsp; at the&nbsp; ocular inspection, it is evident that Denopo's claim to settlement right&nbsp; over the entire Lot No. 74; Pls-250,&nbsp; cannot be sustained.&nbsp; The conclusions of fact arrived at by the District Land Officer are correct, and amply supported.by the&nbsp; evidence. ***."<br></blockquote>In disputing the above statements, the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; insists that&nbsp; the findings and inspection&nbsp; reports&nbsp; of Rufo Ibarra, who conducted the investigation as well&nbsp; as the ocular&nbsp; inspection contained nothing to support the conclusions.&nbsp; It must&nbsp; be remembered, however, that the&nbsp; Bureau and the Department&nbsp; had other papers before them,&nbsp; in&nbsp; addition to such report: draft of the inspection, testimony of witnesses and other official documents, for instance, the official&nbsp; report of the lands officer dated January 30, 1950, who visited and examined&nbsp; the land applied for by Junto.&nbsp; This&nbsp; official certified that Emilio Junto had been occupying and cultivating it&nbsp; since 19,40, as the original&nbsp; occupant,.and that it was not claimed by anybody;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; B).<br><br>Denopol apparently misses one point, which the Director of Lands mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Up&nbsp; to the time the controversy was rebutted, <i>he had not filed any public land application for this lot. </i> In fact, he claimed to&nbsp; be the&nbsp; "absolute owner" thereof.&nbsp; Such being the case, it is no&nbsp; wonder the Government preferred Junto who had duly submitted a Homestead Application and had&nbsp; taken the trouble of securing its permission and approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In a parallel situation, this Court denied in 1940, a petition for certiorari to revise an administrative decision of the land department on a public land controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; Borrowing from the language used therein, we may dispose of this appeal by saying,&nbsp; inasmuch as the Department Head had found as a fact that the application and occupation of the land (24-hectare portion)&nbsp; by&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; Junto preceded the opposition and alleged possession of&nbsp; Roberto Denopol, we are powerless to afford relief by altering such conclusion. Other instances in which&nbsp; we applied&nbsp; identical ruling are cited in the margin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Wherefore, the appealed decision is&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
