				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the general elections held on November 8, 1955, Anacleto  M. Luison  and  Fidel A.  D.   Garcia were  the  only candidates for mayor of Tubay, Agusan.   The  certificate of candidacy of Luison was filed by  the Nacionalista Party of the locality  duly signed by the chairman  and  secretary respectively, while  the  certificate  of candidacy of Garcia was filed by the local branch of the Liberal Party but it was merely signed  by one who was a candidate for vice-mayor.  For this reason, the  executive secretary of the Nationalists Party impugned the sufficiency of the certificate of candidacy filed  in  behalf of  Garcia, whereupon the Commission on Elections, after making  its own investigation, issued Resolution No. 23 declaring Garcia ineligible to run for the  Office.  Consequently, the Commission  on Elections, after  making  its own investigation, issued Resolution No. 23 declaring Garcia ineligible to run for the Office. Consequently, the Commission on Elections who immediately implemented it  by striking out the name of Garcia  from the list of registered candidates.  Said  secretary also relayed the instruction  of the Commission on Elections to the board  of inspectors of every  precinct and the  board of canvassers so that they may be guided accordingly and the votes cast for him may not be counted and instead  be considered as stray votes. <br><br>At this juncture,  Garcia filed an action for prohibition with the Court  of First Instance  of Agusan against the municipal secretary of  Tubay praying  that an order  be issued  restraining the latter  from invalidating his  certificate of candidacy as well as the  votes that may be cast for him, which was however  dismissed  on the ground that said court  had no  jurisdiction  to  review  the ruling of the Commission on Elections on  the matter.  No appeal was taken from  this order which became final.  Meantime, Garcia filed a motion for reconsideration of Resolution No. 23 of the Commission on Elections but the same was denied and no  appeal was likewise taken  from the ruling of the Commission. <br><br>Notwithstanding the  adverse ruling of the Commission on Elections, as well as the  dismissal of the petition for prohibition  sued out by  Garcia,  the  latter continued  with his candidacy and the question  of  his ineligibility became  an issue in the campaign.  And when the time came for the counting and appreciation of the  ballots,  the board  of inspectors, in spite of the adverse ruling of the Commission on Elections, counted all the votes cast for Garcia as valid and credited him with them in the election returns with the result that  he garnered 869 votes  as against 675 of his opponent  Luison.  Consequently, the municipal board of canvassers proclaimed  Garcia as the  mayor elect  of Tubay, Agusan. <br><br>Believing that Garcia is ineligible to hold office, Luison filed a petition  of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> in the proper court  of first instance  for the purpose of disputing his ineligibility and securing his consequent ouster from office,  but  the petition  was dismissed for lack of merit on  a motion filed by respondent.  Luison  appealed from the ruling  and the case was docketed in the  Supreme Court  as G. R. No. L-10916.  Luison took one step further.  He also filed a protest in the same court on the same  ground that Garcia was ineligible because  his  certificate  of candidacy  was declared null  and void by  the  Commission on Elections. <br><br>After the reception of the evidence, the court found for protestee holding that the certificate  of  candidacy filed by  the latter was in  substantial compliance with the law and that the Commission on Elections erred in declaring  him legally insufficient.   It therefore  dismissed  the protest with costs against protestant.  Hence the present appeal. <br><br>The question  whether the certificate of  candidacy  of the protestee is  legally sufficient is now moot it  appearing that tha  resolution of the Commission on Elections declaring that said certificate was not prepared  in accordance with law has  become final for having the  protestee failed to appeal from  said resolution as  required by law.  In this connection,  it should be noted that while this appeal was pending consideration in this court, the  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto </span>case was passed upon wherein  this  Court held  that said resolution is now <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> and  is binding  upon the protestee (See decision in G. R. No. L-10916, promulgated on May 20,  1957).   It  cannot therefore be  now  disputed that protestee is ineligible to  hold  the office for which he was proclaimed. <br><br>The issue now to be determined is whether, the protestee being  ineligible and  protestant having obtained the next highest number  of  votes, the  latter can be declared entitled to hold the office to be vacated by the former. <br><br>Our  answer is  in the  negative.  As this Court has held, "The general rule  is that the fact that a plurality or a majority of the  votes  are  east  for  an  ineligible candidate at  a popular  election does not entitle the candidate receiving  the  next highest number of votes to be declared elected.   In such case the electors have failed to make a choice and the election is  a nullity" (Llamoso <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ferrer, et al., 84 Phil.,  490).   In a subsequent case, this Court also said that where the winning candidate has been declared ineligible, the person  who obtained second place in the election cannot be declared elected since our law not only does not contain an express provision authorizing such declaration but apparently seems to prohibit it (Villar <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Paraiso,  96 Phil., 658: <span style="font-style: italic;">See also</span> Nuval <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span> Guray,  52 Phil., 654 and Topacio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Paredes, 23 Phil., 238). <br><br>Moreover,  a protest  to  disqualify a  protestee  on the ground of ineligibility  is  different from  that  a  protest based on frauds and  irregularities where it may be shown that protestant was the one really elected for having obtained a  plurality of the legal votes.  In the  first case, while the protestee may  be ousted  the protestant  will not be seated; in the  second case, the protestant may  assume office after protestee is unseated.  The first case is brought to court by a  petition of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>, while the second by instituting an  election  protest. Thus,  the  Supreme Court, in denning these two  remedies, said: <br><blockquote>"All  election disputes may be  divided  into  two  distinct classes: (1)  those which pertain to the casting and counting of the ballots; and  (2) those which pertain to the eligibility of the candidates.   If there be eases incapable of being so  classified, they have not been suggested. <br><br>"*  *  * If the nature of the evidence  upon which the  eligibility (qualifications) of a  person to hold  office must be  decided  is considered,  it will be  seen that such evidence has nothing  to do with the manner  of casting snd  counting  the votes.  To  what purpose would be the  examination of  registry lists  and  ballots by  officers appointed and paid for that  purpose  in  determining the  eligibility of a  successful candidate for office?   The eligibility of a person  to be  elected  to a provincial  or municipal office depends  upon his qualifications as a voter, his residence, his allegiance to the United States,  his age, the absence of disqualifications inflicted by the courts by  way of  punishment, etc.   That is, these qualifications and  disqualifications do not depend upon the conduct of election inspectors, the illegal trafficking in votes, the method of  casting  and counting the ballots,  or the election returns.  The  evidence required to establish such qualifications or disqualifications  would not  aid  in  any way in  determining the questions relating to the manner of  casting and  counting  the  ballots.  <span style="font-style: italic;">E  converso,  </span>would  the examination  of ballots  aid in  arriving  at  a decision as to his eligibility.  There  is nothing' in  this section to indicate that  the court shall receive  or consider evidence as to the personal  character  or circumstances  of candidates. <br><br>"Again,  the effect of a  decision that a candidate is not  entitled to the office because of fraud or irregularities in the election is quite different  from  that  produced  by declaring  a  person ineligible  to hold such an office.  In  the former case the court, after an examination of the ballots may find that some other person  than the candidate declared to have received a plurality by the board of canvassers actually received  the greater  number of  votes, in which case the court issues  its mandamus to  the  board of canvassers to correct the returns accordingly; or it  may find that the manner of holding the election and the returns are  so tainted with  fraud or illegality that it cannot be determined who received a plurality of the legally cast ballots.   In the latter case, no question as to the correctness  of the returns or the manner  of casting  and  counting  the ballots  is  before the deciding power, and generally the only  result  can be that the election  fails  entirely.  In  the former, we  have  a contest  in the strict sense of the word, because opposing parties are striving for supremacy.   If it be found that the successful candidate (according to the board of canvassers) obtained a plurality in a legal manner, and another candidate was the legal victor, the former must retire in favor  of the latter.  In the other  case,  there is not, strictly speaking, a contest, as the wreath of victory  cannot be transferred from an ineligible  candidate to any other candidate when the  sole question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally  cast ballots. In the one case the question is as to who received a plurality of the legally cast ballots; in the other, the question is  confined to the personal  character  and circumstances  of  a single individual."  (Topacio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Paredes, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra.</span>) <br></blockquote>Considering the fundamental difference existing between the nature  of a petition for  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>  and  that of an election protest, it  may be said that a  candidate  who files  a protest against  one who has been  proclaimed as having received  the highest number  of votes basing  his protest cannot disguise his  action so as to make his protest a justification to be seated in office.  In other  words, he cannot convert an action for  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>  into an election protest.  This is  because these two  cases are fundamentally different  in  nature and in  purpose.   In  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span>, "there  is not, strictly speaking,  a contest, and the  wreath of  victory cannot be transferred  from  an ineligible candidate  to  any other candidate", while in a  protest, "the question  is as to who received a  plurality  of the  legally cast ballots"  (Topacio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Paredes, supra). The  present action,  therefore, partakes of the nature of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> and as  such  has no reason to  exist.   This question is already involved  in  the  other case (G.  R.  No. L-10916). <br><br>The case of Monsale <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Nico<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">* </span> (46 Off. Gaz., Supp. No.  11, 211) invoked by  protestant is not  in point.  In that case the candidate who was declared ineligible  was not proclaimed because  the votes  cast  for  him  were  declared nullified and  the one proclaimed  is  the candidate  who received the next  highest number of votes.  The trial court found  that the protestant  was  not ineligible because it considered his certificate of candidacy legally sufficient, and when the case was brought to the Supreme Court on appeal the latter  merely reversed  the ruling of the trial court. In that case  there was no  direct pronouncement  that  the one who received  the  next  highest  number  of votes  may by declared seated.  This case cannot be  invoked as  precedent. Wherefore,  the  decision  appealed from  is  reversed. The  Court declares that neither protestee nor protestant has been validly  elected  and so  none is  entitled to  the position  of mayor of  Tubay, Agusan.  No pronouncement as to costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Labrador</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes A., J.,</span>  concurs in  the  result. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, J.

What  is more, despite  the disqualification of his opponent, Fidel A. Garcia (owing to a final decision of the Commission on Elections holding that his certificate of candidacy was  fatally defective), a substantial majority of the votes cast were for Garcia.  This fact leaves no room for  doubt that  said  majority is, or was against Luison. In  view  of Garcia's  aforementioned disqualification, the votes in his favor may be considered as wasted, but <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>, in  the  sense that <span style="font-style: italic;">said  votes  cannot put  him in office,</span> but <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>  in so far  as they show that <span style="font-style: italic;">Luison</span>  <span style="font-style: italic;">does not</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">count with the support  of the majority of the  electorate</span> and that the same is not passively, but <span style="font-style: italic;">actively</span> and  <span style="font-style: italic;">affirmatively</span>mdash;opposed to his  becoming the mayor of Tubay.  I cannot close my eyes to these facts and say, honestly, that Luison was  elected to  said  office, without feeling  that  my  vote would tend to convert our  democratic system into a  sheer fiction, instead  of an  objective reality. <br><br>I  agree, therefore, with the opinion of  Mr. Justice Bautista Angelo to the effect that none of the parties  herein has been elected mayor of Tubay. <br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING</span><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br></div><br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">MONTEMAYOR</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> J.:</span><br> <br>For a better understanding of the  following  dissent, it is  advisable to state briefly the  facts of the  case  as found and related  in  the  learned  majority opinion. <br> <br>In  the general elections of  November 8,  1855,  for the post  of  Mayor of  Tubay,  Agusan,  protestant-appellant Anacleto Luison and protestee-appellee Fidel A. D. Garcia were  the only candidates. Long before the elections, the certificate of candidacy of Garcia was, after due investigation,  found defective  and not valid by the Commission on Elections, and  it so stated  in its Resolution No. 23 of October 11, 1955, declaring him ineligible for the  office of Mayor, and ordering that his certificate of candidacy should not be given due  course.   The Municipal Secretary  of Tubay was duly advised  of this  resolution and  he immediately implemented the same by striking out the name of Garcia from the  list of registered candidates  for Mayor. He also relayed the instructions of the Commission to the Board of Inspectors in  Tubay and to the Board  of  Canvassers,  specially the  chairman of the  same, so that in the counting and  canvassing of votes,  those cast  for  Garcia should not be counted  and should  be considered as stray votes.  Garcia moved  for a  reconsideration  of  Resolution No. 23, but the Commission on Elections denied his motion and Garcia did not appeal from the ruling of the Commission. <br> <br>Despite  the adverse  ruling  of the Commission,  Garcia went  ahead with his  candidacy and  the  question of his ineligibility became  an issue in the election campaign,  so that the voters  were undoubtedly  aware of the fact that Garcia was ineligible,  according to the ruling of the Commission on Elections.  After the voting and  despite the instructions given to the Board of Inspectors  and to the Board of Canvassers about the ineligibility of  Garcia and that votes for him  should  not be counted,  the Board  of Inspectors  counted the votes for him, amounting to 869 as against 675 for his only opponent, Luison,  and the Board of  Canvassers, despite the instructions given  to it about the ineligibility of Garcia and that consequently, the votes for him should not be counted, considered the 869 votes counted for him by the Board of Inspectors as valid,  and proclaimed Garcia Mayor of  Tubay.<br> <br>Luison  filed a petition for  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> against Garcia in the  Court of  First Instance to have  his ineligibility judicially declared and that he be ousted  from the office of Mayor that he had  assumed but en motion of Garcia, the petition was dismissed  for lack of merit.  Luison appealed from  the order  of dismissal to the  Supreme Court in case G. R.  No. L-10916.   In  due time, this  Tribunal decided this case on May 20,  1957, reversing the order of dismissal of the  Court of First instance  and declaring that the resolution of the Commission on Elections about the ineligibility of Garcia is now <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>, and is binding upon him.  In other words, Garcia was ineligible to hold  the  office  of Mayor  of  Tubay  on  the basis of the elections  of  1955. <br> <br>In  addition  to the petition for  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>, Luison filed  an  election protest  against Garcia,  claiming  that inasmuch as the  latter was  ineligible,  the  votes  cast for him should have  been  nullified,  as declared by the Commission on Elections and as  stated  to the  Board of Inspectors and the Board of Canvassers, to the effect  that the votes for him should  not be counted.   After hearing and the  submission  of evidence  in  the lower court, the latter, ignoring and disregarding the ruling of the Commission on Elections about the ineligibility  of  Garcia, declared Garcia eligible because his  certificate of candidacy was in substantial compliance with the law, and the Commission on Elections committed error  in declaring  Garcia's certificate of candidacy defective  and  not valid.  So, it dismissed the protest,  and  Luison appealed the  order of dismissal  to  us,  which  is the present case. <br> <br> In  justice  to  the  lower  court, it should be  stated that the appealed  order  of dismissal of  the  election protest was issued before the promulgation of our decision in the <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> case, G. R.  No. L-10916,  wherein we declared that the ruling of the Commission is now <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>, is  binding upon Garcia, and that  he was really ineligible. <br> <br> As the majority  opinion correctly  states, the issue now to  be determined is whether, inasmuch as Garcia is ineligible and therefore, cannot hold the  post of Mayor which he had illegally assumed, Luison is entitled to assume and hold that office because he received the next highest number of votes.  Citing old decisions  of this Tribunal  to the effect that when  one candidate receiving the  highest number  of votes in  an election  is  declared  ineligible, it does not necessarily mean that the candidate receiving the next highest number  of votes should be declared the winner and  assume the  office vacated  by the candidate  declared ineligible, the majority holds that Luison is  not entitled to the office. <br> <br> The reason for the  aforecited ruling of ours in the  past may, in  my  opinion,  be  satisfactorily if  not easily  explained.   Those cases  wherein that doctrine was laid down were invariably of <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> (under the Election Law), the main  purpose  of which is to  declare one  who  has resumed an elective office, ineligible,  and to oust him from it.  The petitioner  in such a <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> case does not necessarily  have to state and declare in his petition  that he  has better right to the  office.   As to who has a right to said office  is another question.  Furthermore, in those cases wherein we declared that the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes was not necessarily entitled to be declared elected to the office, the  ineligibility of the candidate receiving the highest number of votes was found and declared after the  election, not before.   In other words, the eligibility or ineligibility of that  person receiving the highest number of  votes was,  before the  election, either unknown  or uncertain, so that the electorate had a right to say that they voted for him in the  honest belief that he  was eligible and  could  be elected  to  office.  And,  if after the elections, their  winning  candidate was  subsequently declared ineligible,  those voting  for him  might say that they did not knowingly waste their votes  on an ineligible  candidate, and that had they known it on time, they would  have cast their  votes not necessarily for the candidate receiving the next highest number  of votes, but on another candidate, which would have radically changed the result of the election because of the overwhelming number of their votes, so that the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes cannot truly say  that aside from the candidate who was ineligible, he was the next choice of the electorate. <br> <br> However, as we already stated, the situation in the present case is quite and radically different.   Long  before the  elections, not only the  Board of Inspectors and the Board of Canvassers were duly advised of the ineligibility of Garcia, but the electorate as well, because the ineligibility of Garcia was an issue in the  campaign and Luison and his adherents in their  electoral  meetings and in personal  interviews, undoubtedly  had   advised  and tried  to persuade  the friends and followers of Garcia not to  waste their votes  on him, because being officially declared ineligible by  the  Commission on  Elections, he  could not  be elected anyway.  So, those  voting for Garcia, knowing  all this but  insisting  in  voting for an ineligible candidate, simply wasted their votes.  For all legal purposes, they might as well have  stayed at home on  election day,  as far  as their candidate Garcia was concerned.   Furthermore,  and this is important, they cannot well claim and say  that they  could  or would have  voted for another candidate for Mayor other than  Luison because  there was no such other candidate, Luison and  Garcia being the only candidates for the office  of Mayor.  So,  those voters for Garcia had  no choice.   They either had to vote for Luison, if they wanted to exercise their right of  suffrage, for the post of Mayor or not vote  at all for the post of Mayor. In either case, Luison would have won because he would have received more than his plurality of 675, but not less. <br> <br> These are the reasons why in our discussion of this case, I said that it was about  time that we revised  our ruling in the previous eases  and laid down a new doctrine, not only more in keeping  with the principles of  fairness and justice, but  also  to take into consideration cases wherein the ineligibility  of a  candidate  has been expressly and officially declared before tho elections and/or where there are only two candidates  to an office, so that under such circumstances, the candidate  receiving the next  highest number of votes should, even  in a <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> case, be declared elected  and entitled to the  office vacated by the one found ineligible.   Such new doctrine  or ruling would give more incentive and encouragement to registered candidates to initiate <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> proceedings to oust from elective post, persons who illegally assume and  occupy the same.   Otherwise, the  filing of a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> in connection with an elective office, would only be  based on and motivated by a sense of civic  duty, with no reward or advantage to  the person filing the same, and  the result  would be that  persons illegally elected  to an office and illegally  occupying the same would  continue to do so, because few  persons would take the  trouble and  shoulder the expense  of filing <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> proceedings  when they stand  to receive no benefit  or reward from  winning the case. <br> <br> Besides, the law on  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>  itself, Section  173 of the Revised  Election  Code, requires  that  the person contesting the right of a person who is not eligible but is elected to a provincial or municipal office, must be a registered candidate for  the same office.  That requirement is, to me, significant and  may  have some purpose,  such as the possibility that the contestant or petitioner may have a chance of occupying the office vacated, should he  prove that he was  entitled to  it.  Otherwise, why  the requirement?  A plain citizen or voter interested in good  government, and wishing to have no one but an eligible candidate elected to and occupy  an elective office in his community could as well be considered as qualified and  authorized to file the petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>. <br><blockquote>"* * *"A proceeding by <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> is not strictly speaking an election contest between  two persons  claiming the  same office but determines  only that the  person holding the office  is or is not a usurper; and does not adjudge the rights of  any other claimant thereto, although it has been said that since there is a legal remedy for every legal right,  where the statute  provides no other remedy <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> is an appropriate remedy for obtaining the possession of an office to which a person has been legally elected as well as to remove the usurper therefrom; and  where  by statute the proceeding may be brought upon the relation of  the contesting candidate, if the relator succeeds the proper judgment is that defendant be ousted and the relator placed in  possession of the office."   (20  C. J. 210).</blockquote>  But  there  is  another  phase not only  important,  but to my mind, decisive  in  the  present  case.  As  already stated, Luison filed  not only a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>, but also a  separate election protest.  This   protest, like any other election  protest, concerns  the  proper  and legal counting  of votes.  Luison  claims, and in my opinion, well and correctly, that  inasmuch as the certificate  of candidacy of Garcia was declared "not valid and not to be given due course" by the Commission on Elections,  which declaration, according to our  decision  in G. R.  No.  L-10916, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, is final and  binding upon  Garcia, then  the  effect or result was  as though Garcia had  never filed any certificate of  candidacy.   In other words, he  was a candidate for the post of Mayor  of  Tubay, with no valid  certificate of candidacy or no  certificate  of candidacy at all.   As a matter of  fact,  the Municipal Secretary of Tubay had in  compliance with  the   Resolution of  the  Commission stricken the name  of  Garcia from the  list  of candidates for  mayor.   Section 149,  paragraph 13,  of  the Revised Election  Code  provides that "any   vote  in   favor  of  a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy, * * * shall be  void and  counted as  stray vote but  shall not invalidate the whole ballot".   Under this legal provisions, all  the votes cast for Garcia should have been declared void, counted as stray votes, by the Board of Inspectors, specially since they had been so  advised and  instructed by  the Municipal Secretary and the Commission on  Elections, with  the result that  Luison would  and should have been the  only candidate voted for Mayor, receiving 675 votes, and  therefore, should have been  declared elected. Again, had the Board of Canvassers complied with said instructions and  advice of the  Commission on  Elections and the Municipal Secretary, then said Board of Canvassers should  have ignored the votes illegally counted by the Board of Inspectors for Garcia and should have considered only  the  votes for  Luison  and declared  him  (Luison) elected.  Just because the  Board of Inspectors and the Board of  Canvassers  openly defied  the Commission  on Elections  and the Municipal  Secretary  and ignored  their instructions and  counted the  illegal votes for Garcia, and declared him elected, Luison is now being deprived, not to say robbed, of the post of Mayor to which,  in my opinion, he is in every respect entitled. <br> <br> But the majority  opinion  says  that  protestant Luison "cannot disguise his action so as to make his protest a justification  to be seated in  office.  In other words,  he cannot convert an action for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> into an election protest".  I  am afraid  the majority  is  laboring under a misapprehension.  Luison is not  trying to  convert  an action for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> into an election  protest.  As the majority opinion  itself  says, these two cases of election protest and <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> are fundamentally different in nature  and  effect.   In the  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span>  case, Luison finally succeeded in having the ineligibility of Garcia judicially declared conclusive and binding  upon Garcia. This ineligibility was  based on his failure to file and have  in his  favor a  valid  certificate  of candidacy.  In other words, in the general elections  of  1955 for the post of Mayor, Garcia was not a registered candidate  and had no  valid certificate  of candidacy.   This is now the basis for the present election protest of Luison, namely, that being no candidate according  to law and  having  no certificate of candidacy, his (Garcia's) votes were void, should not have been counted, and should have been considered stray votes under Section 149,  paragraph 13: <br> <blockquote>"Any vote  in favor of a person  who has not filed  a certificate of candidacy  or in favor of a candidate for an office for which he did not present himself, shall  bo void and counted as stray vote but shall not invalidate  the whole ballot."</blockquote>  In  order to succeed  in his election protest to nullify the votes of Garcia,  Luison  first had to  file  a <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> case and obtain,  as he has obtained, a  definite and final ruling by the highest tribunal of the land, that Garcia was not a  legal candidate for the post  of  Mayor and that he  did not  have a  valid certificate of candidacy.  To me, it is therefore clear that there is no incompatibility between the two actions  of  Luison,  namely,  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span>  and election protest, for they complement each other, the success of the  election protest being  based on that of the <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>. <br> <br> The  majority opinion  says  that the  case of Monsale <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Nico  (83 Phil.,  758),  invoked by the protestant  is not in  point.   I beg to  differ.  I  venture to say  that it is truly in  point and applicable.  In that  case, there were three  candidates for  the post of Mayor of  Miagao,  Iloilo, in the general elections held on November 11, 1947, namely, Monsale,  protestant-appellee,   Nico,   protestee-appellant, and one Fagutao.   Monsale,  according   to  the  decision, "withdrew his certificate of candidacy on October 10, 1957, but on November 7, he attempted  to revive it by withdrawing  his   withdrawal.  The  Commission  on  Elections, however, ruled on  November 8 that  the  protestant could no longer be a candidate in spite of his desire to withdraw his  withdrawal."  A canvass of the election returns showed that Nico received 2,291  votes; Fagutao, 126 votes; and Monsale, none, because evidently following the ruling of  the Commission on  Elections to the effect  that  Monsale was  no longer a registered candidate,  the  Board  of  Inspectors did not count the votes for him,  which exceeded those for  Nico by  several  hundred.   Consequently, Nico was  declared  elected.  Monsale protested  the election of Nico and the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, finding  his protest  well  founded,  declared him elected Mayor  of Miagao.  Nico appealed  that  decision  to  the  Supreme Court,  and  this  Tribunal  sustaining the  ruling  of  the Commission on Elections that because of  the withdrawal of his certificate  of candidacy,  the  protestant "can no  longer be a  candidate in  spite of his desire to withdraw his withdrawal",  reversed the appealed  decision,  for  the reason that  Monsale,  not having a valid certificate of candidacy in his favor, had  no right to contest the election of Nico. The  result  was that the proclamation of  Nico by  the Board of Canvassers as Mayor-elect was left undisturbed. Here is a  case where a candidate for the  post of Mayor, who  before the elections, was declared by the Commission on Elections not  to be a  registered candidate  because he had withdrawn  his  certificate of candidacy, received the highest  number  of  votes, but  because the Board  of Inspectors, following the ruling of  the Commission  on Elections,  did  not count the votes  in his favor, the candidate receiving the next highest  number of votes was declared elected, and this Court tacitly approved and sanctioned said declaration or: proclamation  by not disturbing it. But if  the ruling  laid down  in  the  cases cited  in support of the majority opinion had been followed, then this Court should have  held the proclamation of  Nico  as Mayor-elect to be  erroneous  and invalid,  and declared that there was  failure  to elect, which this Tribunal, wisely, did not do. <br> <br> To me,  the  case  for  Luison in the instant  case  is stronger, because he was the only other candidate, whereas in the case of  Monsale <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Nico, there was a third candidate,  and  the  electors  who  voted for Monsale could yet have said or  claimed that had they  known that  their candidate  Monsale was not a  registered candidate, they would have  voted  for the third  candidate, Fagutao,  and. could have made him  win over Nico, a thing which the voters of Garcia in the present case could not claim for the  reason that there  was no other  candidate  to vote for except Luison. <br> <br> There is one  other aspect of the present case  which although not important perhaps, still may merit consideration.   Under the majority opinion, reversing the appealed decision and at the same  time  dismissing the protest, the result is that there was failure to elect, and consequently, a  new election will have to be conducted for the post of Mayor.   It will  be noticed, however, that  the unexpired. term for the  post up to  the  next elections in  1959 is: relatively short,  a  matter of one year  and eight  months, which by the time this decision  shall have become final, would still be  shorter.  I doubt  the wisdom  and  practicability of holding a  special  election to determine who will  occupy the post of Mayor for so short a period.   Aside from the consequent evils and inconveniences occasioned by an election,  such as, reviving old and  forgotten rivalries and  stirring up  antogonism, ill feeling, and  enmities in the community, it  is doubtful whether  worthy candidates for  the  office  could  be  found willing to  undertake an election  campaign  with all  the unavoidable trouble  and expense, and with  all the uncertainty of the result,  fight to the bitter end for a post which  cannot last very long. <br> <br> In  conclusion,  I  hold,  first,  that  even  considering the ruling laid down by this  Court in the  past, that  in  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>  proceedings (election cases),  although the candidate receiving the highest number of votes is  declared ineligible, the candidate receiving  the next highest  number of votes may not be declared elected, nevertheless where the ineligibility of  the first candidate was known  to  the electorate before the  elections  and/or  there were  only two  candidates for  the office, then the candidate receiving  the  next highest  number of votes  could and should even in a <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>  case, be declared elected to the office; second, that in an election protest case, where the ineligibility of a  candidate receiving the highest  number of votes has been  definitely  and  finally  declared  not only by  the  Commission on  Elections,  but by  the courts as well, on the  ground that he failed to file a  valid certificate of candidacy and was, therefore, not a legal candidate for the post, then  all the votes cast for him should not have been counted,  but should have  been considered  void and regarded as  stray votes. <br> <br> The  election protest  of  Luison  goes to  and  centers upon this illegal  counting of the  votes for  Garcia,  and having  succeeded, in my opinion, in establishing the error and  illegality  of  the action of the Board of Inspectors and  the Board of Canvassers in counting and  considering those votes  for Garcia, this Court should direct those two  electoral  bodies  to  correct  their  returns  and  their canvass,  with  the  result that  Luison,  having not only received the  next highest number of votes, but being the only remaining candidate for the post, should be declared elected  to the post of Mayor of  Tubay. <br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;">DISSENTING<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br></div><br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> FELIX,</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">J</span>., <br> <br> I concur in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Marceliano   Montemayor.  I desire,  however,  to  state  the following: <br> <br> It  appears from the records that two cases have been instituted in the Court of First Instance of Agusan:  one G. R. No. L-10916—was a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warrant</span>o for the  purpose  of securing a declaration  of  ineligibility  of Fidel A. D. Garcia  as  Mayor of Tubay, Agusan,  and his consequent ouster from  office,  and the  other  G.  R. No. L-10981 ail  election protest by  the  same  petitioner,  as protestant, against the same respondent Fidel A. D. Garcia, as protestee.   The first case was already decided by this Court declaring the  ineligibility of respondent Garcia who naturally had to cease holding the  position of Mayor  of Tubay,  Agusan.  Because of the  provisions of law and the jurisprudence on  the matter,  Anacleto Luison  could not in that case,  succeed Garcia in that post. <br> <br> In  the  present case, G. R.  No. L-10981,  wherein We decide the election protest, the majority basing its decision on the result of  the previous <span style="font-style: italic;">quo  warranto</span> case, renders judgment dismissing the  protest and  by the same  stroke of the pen prevents the protestant Anacleto  Luison from succeeding Fidel  A. D. Garcia in the position of Mayor of Tubay, Agusan, notwithstanding the fact that he was the only other candidate voted for that office  in the general elections of November 8, 1955.<br> <br> I dissent from the majority decision  because there is absolutely no reason  to disregard the  votes cast in favor of Anacleto Luison which were the only <span style="font-style: italic;">valid</span> votes east for Mayor  in  said elections.   Under  the circumstances and  facts  appearing on  record and  the  law applicable thereto, the votes cast in favor of Fidel A. D. Garcia have to be considered  as <span style="font-style: italic;">stray votes</span>. <br> <br> In view of the theory of the majority and taking into account the  short period of incumbency that remains for a new mayor of Tubay,  Agusan,  there  will be with  all probability no  new  special election for Mayor of  Tubay and as our decision in the <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span>  case has already become final, there  is nothing to prevent  the  President of the Philippines from appointing Fidel A. D.  Garcia to continue holding the  office of mayor  of said  municipality for the rest  of the period,  thus nullifying  our  findings and conclusions in the <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> case and leaving the sound  principles  of  democracy  somewhat  worsted.  I, therefore, vote against the dismissal of this case and for the declaration that protestant-appellant  Anacleto  Luison has been duly elected to the  position of Mayor of  Tubay, Agusan, in the general elections of November 8, 1955. <br><br></div>
