				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Upon petition of Roque Senarillos (appellee before us) and&nbsp; after due&nbsp; hearing, Judge M. M. Mejia of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Cebu (in Case No. R-4001), issued a writ of mandamus to compel the&nbsp; respondents Municipal Mayor and&nbsp; Council&nbsp; of Sibonga, Cebu, to reinstate&nbsp; petitioner to the position of Chief of Police of Sibonga, Cebu, declaring null&nbsp; and void his&nbsp; removal from that post,&nbsp; although the&nbsp; same was approved&nbsp; by the council and confirmed by the Director of Civil&nbsp; Service and the Board of Civil Service Appeals; and required the respondents Municipal Treasurer of Sibonga and Provincial Treasurer of Cebu to&nbsp; pay petitioner Senarillos&nbsp; his&nbsp; salary at P840.00 per annum from January 3, 1952, and taxing costs against respondents&nbsp; Municipal Mayor&nbsp; and Council&nbsp; of Sibonga. Respondents have appealed.<p>The parties&nbsp; are agreed that Roque Senarillos, being a civil&nbsp; service eligible,&nbsp; was appointed Chief of Police of Sibonga, Cebu, and served as such until January 2, 1952. On that&nbsp; date, upon charges filed by one Roque Geraldizo and&nbsp; despite his denials, Senarillos&nbsp; was suspended&nbsp; by the Municipal Mayor of Sibonga, and investigated by a&nbsp; "police committee"&nbsp; composed&nbsp; of three councilors,&nbsp; created by Resolution No. 2,&nbsp; Series 1952, of the municipal council.&nbsp; Notwithstanding express protest on&nbsp; the part of Senarillos that the investigation should not be conducted by a committee, but&nbsp; by full&nbsp; council,&nbsp; as provided&nbsp; by Republic Act 557, the committee&nbsp; proceeded to try his case, and on April&nbsp; 15, 1952, rendered an adverse decision, signed later&nbsp; by the members of the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; council.&nbsp; This&nbsp; decision was appealed to, and&nbsp; on August 28, 1952,&nbsp; was&nbsp; affirmed by, the Commissioner of Civil Service, and later in October, 1954, by the Civil Service Board of Appeals.</p><p>In&nbsp; the meantime, upon the expiration of the original period of suspension, Municipal Mayor Hermosisima again suspended&nbsp; Senarillos&nbsp; on the&nbsp; strength of&nbsp; Administrative Case No. V-6, which was never&nbsp; tried; and as&nbsp; the&nbsp; sixty. days&nbsp; of the second suspension expired, the Chief of Police was&nbsp; reinstated on May 25, 1952 However on July&nbsp; 9, 1952&nbsp; the Municipal Mayor filed a criminal case for swindling against Senarillos, and suspended him&nbsp; for&nbsp; the third time.&nbsp; The criminal case was dismissed on July&nbsp; 28, 1954. Then on&nbsp; April 27, 1955, Senarillos&nbsp; resorted&nbsp; to the Court of First Instance&nbsp; for&nbsp; relief.</p><p>That&nbsp; the investigation&nbsp; of&nbsp; police officers under&nbsp; Republic Act No. 557 (as distinguished from&nbsp; section&nbsp; 2272 of the&nbsp; Administrative Code)&nbsp; must be&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; by the council itself,&nbsp; and not&nbsp; by a&nbsp; mere&nbsp; committee thereof,&nbsp; is now&nbsp; established&nbsp; jurisprudence and&nbsp; no longer&nbsp; open&nbsp; to question since&nbsp; our decision in Festejo <em>vs</em>. Mayor of&nbsp; Nabua, 96 Phil., 286;&nbsp; 51 Off. Gaz. p. 121,&nbsp; reaffirmed in subsequent decisions.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The second reason for invalidating the investigation is&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; charges were investigated by a&nbsp; committee&nbsp; of the city council, not by the council itself.&nbsp; While&nbsp; it is true that&nbsp; we had held in Santos <em>vs</em>. Mendoza, 48 Off. Gaz., No. 11, p. 4801, that such a procedure&nbsp; is valid, the law has been&nbsp; changed <em>since</em>&nbsp; the&nbsp; above decision.&nbsp; Republic Act No. 557 has eliminated the provision authorizing&nbsp; investigation by a committee of the&nbsp; council. We&nbsp; held that the&nbsp; change meant&nbsp; that the&nbsp; investigation should&nbsp; be by the council itself (Festejo <em>vs</em>. Municipal Mayor of Nabua,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-4983, prom. December&nbsp; 22, 1954).&nbsp; We&nbsp; affirmed this doctrine&nbsp; in the recent case of Covacha&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Amante, G. R. No. L-8358,&nbsp; promulgated May 25,1956.&nbsp; The trial court was, therefore, correct in holding that the investigation proceedings were not conducted by the municipal council and in annulling the results&nbsp; of the investigation.&nbsp; (Crispin Carmona <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Felix P.&nbsp; Amante, G. R. Nos. 8790-8797,&nbsp; August&nbsp; 14 1956, 52 Off. Gaz. No. 11, p. 5109).</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, it is&nbsp; clear that under the present&nbsp; law, the "police&nbsp; committee" constituted by the Municipal Council of Sibonga&nbsp; had&nbsp; no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to investigate&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee Chief of&nbsp; Police; hence the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; against&nbsp; him was&nbsp;&nbsp; invalid,&nbsp; even if&nbsp; concurred&nbsp; in&nbsp; by the&nbsp; rest&nbsp; of&nbsp; the councilors, specially since the petitioner&nbsp; called attention from the&nbsp; beginning&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; impropriety and illegality of the committee's&nbsp; actuations, and of&nbsp; his trial by&nbsp; only some and not all&nbsp; the&nbsp; members of the council.&nbsp; The&nbsp; subsequent reaffirmation of their decision by the&nbsp; Civil Service authorities could not validate&nbsp; a proceeding that was illegal and <em>ab initio</em> void.</p><p>That the decision of the Municipal Council of Sibonga was issued before the decision in&nbsp; Festejo <em>vs</em>. Mayor&nbsp; of Nabua&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered,&nbsp; would&nbsp; be, at&nbsp; the&nbsp; most, proof&nbsp; of good faith on the part of the police committee, but can not sustain the validity of their action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is elementary that&nbsp; the&nbsp; interpretation placed by&nbsp; this Court upon Republic Act 557 constitutes part of the law as of the date it was&nbsp; originally passed,&nbsp; since this Court's construction merely&nbsp; establishes the contemporaneous legislative intent that the interpreted law carried into&nbsp; effect.</p><p>Respondents also claim&nbsp; that petitioner was guilty&nbsp; of laches,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; strength&nbsp; of Unabia <em>vs</em>. Mayor of Cebu, 99&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 258 and related&nbsp; decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffice&nbsp; it to observe that the persistent efforts&nbsp; of&nbsp; the appellee to secure from the&nbsp; Civil Service authorities&nbsp; a reversal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; unlawful decisions of the Municipal Council of Sibonga, and the harassment and prosecution to which he was subjected by the mayor, who suspended petitioner-appellee three times, are more than adequate evidence that the appellee did not sleep on his rights or abandon his office.&nbsp; His&nbsp; appeal was finally decided by the Civil Service on October of 1954, and this case was filed less than a year later, in April 1955.</p><p>The decision&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed, with the sole modification that the reimbursement of&nbsp; petitioner-appellee's&nbsp; salary&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not include the&nbsp; pay corresponding&nbsp; to the&nbsp; period from&nbsp; May 26&nbsp; to&nbsp; July&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; since it was stipulated (p. 14) that he was paid for that time.&nbsp; Costs against&nbsp; respondents,&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Mayor&nbsp; and Council&nbsp; of Sibonga,&nbsp; Cebu.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia,</em> and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
