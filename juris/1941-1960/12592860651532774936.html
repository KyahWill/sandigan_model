				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
dismissing the complaint for the recovery of a piece of jewelry or its value in 
the sum of P1,500. The facts involved as may be gathered from the record, are 
simple, clear, and without dispute. Since the year 1931 plaintiffs Esteban de 
Guzman and his wife Maxima Laperal were engaged in the sale of jewelry and 
sustained business relations with the defendants Roman Alvia and his wife 
Magdalena de Alvia who, especially Magdalena, used to receive pieces of jewelry 
from them for sale on commission or rather that the compensation received by 
Magdalena was the over price she could secure over and above that fixed by 
plaintiffs. On October 31, 1946, Magdalena through her husband Roman Alvia 
received from plaintiffs for sale, several pieces of jewelry, among them the 
jewelry in question described as "medio terno, rositas with 25 brillantes" 
valued at P1,500. Said jewelry was later entrusted by Magdalena to one Eugenia 
Villarin, for sale. Eugenia is said to have absconded with said jewelry and 
failed to account for it to Magdalena.
<p>On several occasions, plaintiffs demanded of Magdalena and her husband Roman, 
the return of the jewelry or its value but defendants were unable to comply with 
the demands. Thereafter, a criminal complaint for estafa was filed in the Court 
of First Instance of Manila (Criminal Case No. 5549) against Roman Alvia because 
it was he who actually received the jewelry from plaintiffs and signed the 
receipt Exhibit A. Roman was acquitted of the charges on the ground that he 
merely acted as agent of his wife Magdalena who was the person who had business 
dealings with the plaintiffs. Then a second complaint also for estafa (Criminal 
Case No. 8776) was filed against Magdalena. She was also acquitted on the ground 
that there was no misappropriation or conversion under Article 315 of the 
Revised Penal Code. Said trial judge Conrado Sanchez in his decision Exhibit 
1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ever since about the year 1931 defendant and complainant sustained business 
relations. Defendant used to get jewels—for sale— from the spouses Esteban de 
Guzman and Maxima Laperal de Guzman. The jewels not sold were returned to 
complainant. It was also the practice known to complainant and his wife that 
said jewels were being entrusted by defendant to other persons for sale. It 
seems that the compensation of the accused consists of the overprice that she 
could secure over and above the price set forth by the complainant.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>"<em>Defendant does not deny that she received the jewels</em> obtained by 
her husband from complainant under the receipt Exhibit A.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>"But as to this piece of jewelry, "medio terno 
rositas", worth P1,500, defendant did not profit therefrom; she did not sell 
them to said Eugenia Villarin. The fact is that that piece of jewelry (with 
others) was delivered by defendant to Eugenia Villarin for purposes of sale. 
There is absolutely no evidence or indication of collusion between defendant and 
Eugenia Villarin.

<p>"Whether or not defendant was authorized by complainant to sell the jewelry 
is another point of inquiry. It is true that under the terms of the receipt 
Exhibit A signed by defendant's husband the latter, that is, Roman M. Alvia, was 
not allowed to sell the jewelry thru an agent. But this Exhibit A was not signed 
by defendant. And defendant testified in court that the standing practice known 
to complainant and his wife during their business relations was that she 
(defendant) could entrust jewels to others for purposes of sale. That explains 
why in November of 1946 defendant sent her daughter Clara Alvia to ask from Dona 
Maxima Laperal de Guzman, wife of complainant, whether they would agree to a 
reduction of the price of the jewelry in question to P1,350; for then, Eugenia 
Villarin told defendant that she had a purchaser for that amount.</p>
<p>"The record shows that defendant was actuated with <em>good faith</em>. When 
she could no longer locate Eugenia Villarin she went to Mrs. De Guzman and asked 
for time to get back the jewelry. But again she failed to get Eugenia Villarin. 
She was candid enough to own her own fault in having entrusted the jewelry to 
that person (referring to Eugenia Villarin). She offered that she be allowed to 
pay in installments the said piece of jewelry as she did not want to lose her 
credit with complainant and his wife. She went to the extent of offering two 
Torrens titles covering five and one-half hectares of rice land in Calauan, 
Laguna, for complainant and his wife to dispose of the way they wanted to, just 
to make good her obligation. They did not accept any of her offers. But instead, 
they threatened criminal action which they did, first against the husband Roman 
M. Alvia who was acquitted (Criminal Case No. 5549 of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, Exh. E), and now against the wife Magdalena de Alvia, both 
covering the same jewelry.</p>
<p>"The facts heretofore related impress upon the mind of the court the fact 
that <em>the element of misappropriation or conversion so essential to this type 
of estafa is conspicuous by its absence in the present case. Therefore, the 
crime of estafa does ruot exist</em>.</p>
<p>"* * *. In the present case, good faith and lack of intent to appropriate are 
present. Defendant's liability, therefore, if any, is <em>purely civil</em>." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of the acquittal of defendants spouses in the two criminal cases, the 
present civil action to recover the jewelry or its value, was brought in the 
Municipal Court. resulting in a decision in favor of plaintiffs. On appeal to 
the Court.of First Instance of Manila, as already stated, the complaint was 
dismissed on the basis of the doctrine laid down by this Court in the case of 
Wise &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Larion 45 Phil., 314 to the effect that acquittal in 
a criminal prosecution is an insuperable obstacle to the civil proceedings. The 
appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals but it was later certified to us by 
said appellate tribunal. </p>
<p>Without attempting to analyze the decision of this Court in the case of Wise 
&amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Larion, supra, as to its absolute correctness and its 
scope, particularly its implications, we are satisfied that said case is not 
applicable here. It will be noticed that there Justice Street would appear not 
to have entirely accepted without qualification the doctrine laid down in the 
case of Almeida <em>vs</em>. Abaroa, 40 Phil., 1056, and he seems to have made a 
distinction as when he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. It is enough for our present purposes to say that where, as here, 
<em>the facts on which civil liability is based are of such nature as inevitably 
to constitute a crime</em>, if anything, acquittal in a criminal prosecution is 
,an insuperable obstacle to the civil proceeding."</p></blockquote>
<p>In that case of Wise &amp; Co. although defendant did not make use of or 
appropriate to himself the amount of which Wise &amp; Co., was swindled, because 
said amount went to the manager, still, Larion as assistant manager helped, and 
made himself an accomplice in the misappropriation. For that he was charged with 
estafa but was acquitted. Under those circumstances his acquittal was an 
obstacle to his being held liable in civil action. In the present case, however, 
the facts alleged in the complaint and on which civil liability is based, are 
not of such nature as to constitute a crime. As held by Judge Sanchez in the 
Criminal Case No. 8776 against Magdalena, there was no misappropriation or 
conversion of the jewelry placed in her custody. Neither was there bad faith. 
Her failure to return the same to its owner was due to the fact that following 
the practice of which said owner was aware, the jewelry was given for sale to a 
third party, Eugenia Villarin and the latter was the one who misappropriated it, 
for which reason she was prosecuted for estafa. It was even intimated by Judge 
Sanchez in his judgment of acquittal that the responsibility of Magdalena was 
civil, not criminal.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellants contend that the present case comes under the 
provisions of Article 29 of the new Civil Code which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the accused in a criminal prosecution is acquitted on the ground that 
his guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, a civil action for 
damages for the same act or omission may be instituted. Such, action requires 
only a preponderance of evidence. Upon motion of the defendant, the court may 
require the plaintiff to file a j bond to answer for damages in cases the 
complaint should be found to be malicious.</p>
<p>"If in a criminal case the judgment of acquittal is based upon reasonable 
doubt, the court shall so declare. In the absence of any declaration to that 
effect, it may be inferred from the text of the decision whether or not the 
acquittal is due to that ground."</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the above-quoted legal provision, under Article 2267 of the same 
Code is made applicable not only to future cases, but also to those pending, 
like the present, on the date when the new Civil Code went into effect, said 
Article 29 however, is hardly applicable because it plainly refers to an 
acquittal on the ground that the guilt of the accused has not been proven beyond 
reasonable doubt. The acquittal of Magdalena in Criminal Case No. 8776 was not 
due to her guilt not having been proven beyond reasonable doubt but because 
there being no misappropriation or conversion or bad faith, the crime charged 
was not committed. What in our opinion is applicable is Rule 107, section 1, 
paragraph (d) of the Rules of Court which reads thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the 
civil, unless the extinction proceeds from a declaration in a final judgment 
that the fact from which the civil might arise did not exist. In the other 
cases, the person entitled to the civil action may institute it in the 
jurisdiction and in the manner provided by law against the.person who may be 
liable for restitution of the thing and reparation or indemnity for the damages 
suffered;</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as the final judgment in Criminal Case No. 8776 against Magdalena 
does not contain any declaration that the fact from which civil liability might 
arise did not exist but on the contrary, it found that she received the jewelry 
and it intimated that her responsibility was civil rather than criminal, then 
the civil action was not extinguished. The rule above reproduced comes from the 
Spanish Law of Criminal Procedure (Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal), article 116 
thereof, cited and applied in the case of Oro <em>vs</em>. Pajarillo, 23 Phil., 
484.</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that the acquittal of Magdalena of the charge of estafa 
in the criminal case did not extinguish her civil liability. It is equally clear 
that the acquittal of her husband Roman Alvia in the estafa case against him 
extinguished his civil liability because the decision acquitting him expressly 
said that he merely acted as a <em>mandatario</em> or agent of Magdalena and 
consequently, was in no way responsible.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, in so far as the decision appealed from dismisses 
the complaint against Magdalena de Alvia, the same is hereby reversed, with 
costs. Case remanded for further proceedings.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
