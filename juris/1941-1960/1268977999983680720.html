				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused&nbsp; was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with attempted theft&nbsp; with the aggravating circumstance of recidivism.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trial, wherein she waived her right to present evidence, she was convicted and sentenced to six months and one day of <em>destierro,</em> with the accessory penalties provided for by law and to pay the costs. In due time, she appealed to the Court of Appeals and considering that one of the errors she assigns involves the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court, the case was&nbsp; certified to this Court under&nbsp; section&nbsp; 17 (3) of Republic Act 296, as amended.<p>The only question to be determined&nbsp; is whether the trial court has jurisdiction to try the offense charged in the information, for if the&nbsp; answer&nbsp; is in the negative, then it would be unnecessary&nbsp; for us to go into the merits of the case.</p><p>The offense charged is attempted theft which consists, according to the information, in that the accused "did then and there open the bag of the latter (offended party) containing the sum of P202.00 in cash of different denominations with the evident intent to take, steal and carry away said cash money, but the said accused was not however able to&nbsp; perform all&nbsp; the&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of execution which would have produced the crime&nbsp; of theft as a consequence by reason of&nbsp; causes independent&nbsp; of&nbsp; her&nbsp; (his) own voluntary desistance.&nbsp; Being an attempted offense, a penalty lower by two degrees than&nbsp; that prescribed&nbsp; by law for the consummated felony should&nbsp; be imposed (Article 51, Revised Penal Code).</p><p>Under Article 309 of the same Code, if&nbsp; the value of the property stolen is more than P200&nbsp; but does not exceed P2,000, the penalty of&nbsp; prison correctional in&nbsp; its minimum and medium periods shall be imposed.&nbsp; If we reduce this penalty by two degrees, the penalty to be imposed will be destierro in its&nbsp; maximum period&nbsp; to <em>arresto&nbsp; mayor</em> in its minimum period (Art;&nbsp; 71, Revised Penal Code, as amended by section 3, Commonwealth Act No. 217, specially Scale No. 1&nbsp; thereof),&nbsp; which, in so far as&nbsp; the imprisonment is&nbsp; concerned, does not&nbsp; exceed&nbsp; 2 months (Uy Chin Hua <em>vs</em>. Dinglasan, 47&nbsp; Off. Gaz., Sup. 12, p. 233 and People <em>vs</em>. Santos, 87 Phil., 687).&nbsp; The offense charged in the information comes, therefore, under the original jurisdiction of the municipal court&nbsp; in view of&nbsp; section 87 (<em>b</em>) of Republic Act No. 296 which provides that "All offenses&nbsp; in which the penalty provided by law is imprisonment for not more than six months, or a fine of not more than two hundred&nbsp; pesos,&nbsp; or both&nbsp; such&nbsp; fine&nbsp; and imprisonment", come under the original jurisdiction of&nbsp; said court.</p><p>It is true that section&nbsp; 87, subsection (<em>c</em>) of&nbsp; Republic Act 296&nbsp; also&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that "larceny, embezzlement, and estafa where the amount of money or property stolen, embezzled or otherwise involved, does&nbsp; not exceed the sum&nbsp; or value of two&nbsp; hundred&nbsp; pesos",&nbsp; likewise come under the original jurisdiction of the municipal court of a chartered city,&nbsp; and in the instant case the&nbsp; value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property involved&nbsp; is ?202, or a little more than the minimum fixed in said subsection; however, we should&nbsp; nof lose sight&nbsp; of&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; offenses mentioned in said subsection refer to consummated acts and not to those that are merely attempted or frustrated in nature.&nbsp; In fact, said subsection refer&nbsp; to "amount&nbsp; of money or property stolen, embezzled or&nbsp; otherwise involved."&nbsp;&nbsp; A different&nbsp; interpretation would give&nbsp; rise to the incongrous situation where while under subsection (<em>c</em>) the offense does not come within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the municipal court because the&nbsp; value of the thing stolen is more than P200, it at the same time comes within its jurisdiction under&nbsp; subsection (<em>b</em>) because the penalty involved is less than six months.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cannot be&nbsp; the intendment of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; an&nbsp; offense which calls&nbsp; for the application of a penalty of<em> destierro</em> in its maximum) period to 2&nbsp; months&nbsp; of&nbsp; <em>arresto mayor</em> cannot come under the jurisdiction of the&nbsp; court of&nbsp; first instance [subsection&nbsp; (<em>f</em>), section 44 of Republic Act 296].</p><p>The fact that the accused is&nbsp; a recidivist is also of no moment. This circumstance&nbsp; can&nbsp; at most aggravate, the penalty within the range provided for by law.</p><p>Wherefore, the decision of the lower court is reversed, without prejudice&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the prosecution&nbsp; to re-file the information with the proper court.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L.,&nbsp; Endencia</em> and&nbsp; <em>Felix,&nbsp; JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
