				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review of the decision of the Court of Appeals declaring plaintiffs Filomena 
Vda. de Umbao, et al., the owners entitled to possession of a parcel of land of 
about three hectares located in Sta. Ana, Tubay, Agusan, and ordering defendants 
to vacate it and pay plaintiffs the sum of P2,363.50 value of the Tatter's share 
in the products of the land from the time of usurpation thereof by said 
defendants.
<p>The appellate court found the lot to be a part of a bigger parcel of over 53 
hectares which had been in possession of plaintiffs and their 
predecessors-in-interest since the year 1918 at least. Said court further found 
that sometime in 1946, defendants surreptitiously took possession of the 
3-hectare lot in dispute, and kept it through force. These conclusions were 
drawn from the testimony of the witnesses of both sides and the documentary 
evidence, especially the survey plan approved March 12, 1918, of the whole 
53-hectare land, and the relocation report of the private surveyor, Exh. F.</p>
<p>The main portion of defendants-appellants' printed brief here attempts to 
challenge the findings of the court <em>a quo</em> on the matter. Enough to say 
that the question of physical possession is purely factual, and our usual 
practice has been not to disturb the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals. 
The same thing may be said of appellants' contention that the value of the 
products of the land has not been adequately proven by competent evidence. There 
was testimony for, plaintiffs which the Court accepted for purposes of 
computation.</p>
<p>In this connection, it should be stated that when this petition for review 
was submitted for admission, petitioners expounded the above two questions only. 
Under ordinary circumstances, the petition would have been denied, the issues 
being factual. However, this Court noticed a point which it thought could be the 
subject of further debate: the timeliness of the appeal by plaintiffs to the 
Court of Appeals. In the court of first instance, the plaintiffs obtained 
judgment for possession of the land; but they got no damages. They, and the 
defendants, appealed to the Court of Appeals. There, they again prevailed on the 
issue of possession, and also on their claim for compensation. Defendants there 
contended that plaintiffs' appeal was belated, but the Court of Appeals decided 
it was not; and in so deciding, it apparently held that in estimating the period 
to perfect the appeal, the day of <em>actual receipt</em> of copy of the court's 
order denying their motion for reconsideration, should be the starting point—not 
the <em>notice sent by the postmaster</em>—the copy having been sent by 
registered mail. (See Rule 27, sec. 8) Now, as at that time (March 1959), there 
were litigations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> pending before this 
Court affecting the application of the very section of the Rules, we gave due 
course to this petition. Note specially that if the plaintiffs' appeal had been 
untimely, no damages could have been awarded to them.</p>
<p>In their printed brief, however, defendants-appellants did not discuss the 
point here. Perhaps they did so advisedly, because upon careful consideration, 
there was really no adequate foundation to their contention that plaintiffs had 
appealed out of time. Such contention amounted to this: 21 days after receipt of 
copy of the judge's decision, plaintiffs moved to reconsider; copy of the order 
denying their motion was sent to plaintiffs by registered mail on November 8, 
1954; in view of "the presumption that letters duly directed and mailed are 
received in the regular course of the mail (Rule 123, Sec. 69-V), the order of 
denial should have been received by plaintiff within the first five days from 
the date of the first notice of the postmaster or on November 16, since mail 
service between Butuan City and. Surigao takes only 2 days. The Addressee having 
failed to claim said letter, service of notice took effect at the expiration of 
such time (Rule 27, sec. 8) and appeal having been filed only on November 27, 
1954, 34 days after notification of the decision,-plaintiffs' appeal was 
allegedly filed out of time. * * *."</p>
<p>We say defendants' theory has no sufficient foundation, because it rests on a 
presumption <em>derived from another presumption</em>. Indeed, they argue: 
<em>it is presumed</em> that the registered letter was received at the point of 
destination in regular course of the mails—2 days after November 8; <em>it is 
also presumed</em> that the postmaster complied with his duty and sent the first 
notice on November 10<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>; therefore, 
plaintiffs must be deemed to have received the letter five days after November 
10, according to Rule 27, sec. 8. This is tacking one presumption to another, 
which is not permitted by orthodox rules of evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An inference of fact should not be drawn from premises which are uncertain, 
but the facts on which an inference may legitimately rest must, it is said, be 
established by direct evidence as if they were the very facts in issue. <em>It 
follows that one presumption cannot be based</em> on another presumption, and it 
has been broadly asserted in many decisions that inferences cannot be founded on 
inferences (31 Corpus Juris Secundum, "Evidence", sec. 116(b) [Italics 
ours]).</p></blockquote>
<p>The result, therefore, is that the five-days-after-the-post-mastur's-notice 
principle could not be applied; defendants' arguments built thereon collapses 
necessarily; and the apel-late court rightfully passed judgment on plaintiffs' 
appeal.</p>
<p>As stated, this was the legal question which on a preliminary survey, induced 
this Court to entertain the petition for review. It turns out, however, that 
petitioners finally elected to discuss only factual questions, which we are not 
at liberty to revise.</p>
<p>On the other hand, upon the basis of the facts established according to the 
Court of Appeals—which are binding here —there is no doubting the correctness of 
its adjudication: plaintiffs are entitled to possession, plus the estimated 
damages.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision under review should be, and is hereby, affirmed with 
costs against appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed.</em></p>
