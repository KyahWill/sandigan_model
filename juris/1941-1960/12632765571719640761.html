				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is before us on appeal from an order of tho Court of First Instance 
of Leyte dismissing a motion of election protest. Judge Edmundo S. Piccio, who 
made the order, held that the court "did not acquire jurisdiction on the instant 
case" because the motion of protest did not allege that the protestant had duly 
filed a certificate of candidacy as provided by section 174 of the Revised 
Election Code.
<p>The motion of protest recited that the protestant "was a candidate voted for 
in the general election held on November 11, 1947, with a valid certificate of 
candidacy for the Office of Mayor of the Municipality of Capoocan, Province of 
Leyte, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Court." This allegation 
unequivocally signifies that the protestant "presented a certificate of 
candidacy." Couched in different forms, the two expressions convey the same 
idea.</p>
<p>This Court in Dato Ali <em>vs</em>. Court of First instance of Lanao and 
Natancop Indol, G.R. No. L-1888, and in Ismael Marohon vs. Court of First 
instance of Lanao and Macaorao Balindong,<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> G. R. No. L-1889, said that an allegation 
that the protestants filed certificate of candidacy and an allegation that they 
were candidates, mean the same thing. He further said that jurisdictional facts 
need not have to be recided in precise and technical form, although that may be 
the better practice in proper cases; that when, from the allegations of the 
pleadings, taken together, the matters required to be averred may be gathered, 
the court will entertain jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The allegation in the above cases relative to the filing of a certificate of 
candidacy was much loss specific than the allegation which has been held 
insufficient in the present case.</p>
<p>With reversal of the order from which this appeal has teen taken, tho Court 
of First Instance of Leyte is hereby ordered to proceed with the trial of the 
protest on the merits. The protestee and appellee will pay the cost of this 
appeal.</p><em>Par√°s, Feria, Perfecto, </em>and <em>Briones, JJ.,</em> concur. 
<br><em>Pablo, Bengzon,</em> and <em>Padilla, JJ.,</em> concur in the 
result.<br><br><br>
