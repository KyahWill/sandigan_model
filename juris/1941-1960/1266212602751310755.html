				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In January 1957,&nbsp; the Balaquezon Transportation Labor Union (Chapter&nbsp; VII-B) filed in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial Relations&nbsp; several complaints for&nbsp; unfair labor&nbsp; practices&nbsp; against the Laguna Tayabas Bus Company because it had interfered with the employees' right to organize themselves by&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; them on&nbsp; account of&nbsp; union&nbsp; activities and by&nbsp; sponsoring&nbsp; a&nbsp; company union&nbsp; (cases Nos.&nbsp; 1117-ULP, 1153-ULP and 1171-ULP).&nbsp; On 23&nbsp; February 1957, Pascual Y. Reyes, acting prosecutor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court charged the Laguna Tayabas Bus Company with unjustifiably dismissing on&nbsp; 22 November&nbsp; 1956 Pedro Ordono,&nbsp; a&nbsp; driver of the Company, because of his union activities (case No. 1192-ULP, Annex B).&nbsp; On 25 June 1957 the complaining&nbsp; union&nbsp; moved to consolidate the four cases (Annex A).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 25 June 1957, it declared and went on strike to prevent&nbsp; the the Company from further laying off its&nbsp; employees who were&nbsp; members&nbsp; of the complaining&nbsp; union and from aiding&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; company&nbsp; union—the&nbsp; Laguna Tayabas Bus Company Employee's Association.&nbsp; On 2 July 1957 Dr. Marcelino T. Enriquez, representative&nbsp; of the complaining union,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a charge against the Company&nbsp; for&nbsp; aiding and&nbsp; abetting&nbsp; a company union (Annex C). "To resolve the strike in the Laguna area,&nbsp; which&nbsp; had paralyzed the transportation facilities" in&nbsp; the&nbsp; provinces of&nbsp; Quezon, Rizal and Laguna, on&nbsp; 6&nbsp; July 1957 the complaining union, the Laguna&nbsp; Tayabas Bus Company and the Laguna Tayabas Bus Company Employees' Association entered into a temporary&nbsp; agreement and as a result thereof the picket lines&nbsp; were withdrawn or recalled.&nbsp; Upon the suggestion of the.then Secretary of Labor Agapito&nbsp; C. Braganza the two labor unions and the company agreed to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; an election under the supervision of the Department&nbsp; of&nbsp; Labor on&nbsp; 9, 10 and 11 July&nbsp; 1957 from 9:30&nbsp; a.m. to&nbsp; 7:00 p.m. at the regional office No.&nbsp; Ill, San Pablo City, and all1 employees listed&nbsp; in the payrolls of the Company as of 25 June 1957, shall be eligible (entitled)&nbsp; to&nbsp; vote at such election and that the labor union winning&nbsp; or&nbsp; chosen to be the collective bargaining representative would take charge&nbsp; of the enforcement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; collective&nbsp; bargaining&nbsp; agreement dated 13 November&nbsp; 1954 until&nbsp; 13 November&nbsp; 1957 (Annex A to Annex E of the petition-for certiorari).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 9 July 1957,. the same parties&nbsp; covenanted in a supplementary&nbsp; agreement to hold the&nbsp; election&nbsp; on 16 and&nbsp; 17 July instead of 9, 10 and&nbsp; 11 July 1957 as&nbsp; previously agreed upon and, if the election should not be finished in two days,&nbsp; to extend it to 18 July 1957, and reiterated the agreement as to the&nbsp; employees&nbsp; who&nbsp; would be&nbsp; qualified or&nbsp; entitled to vote at the election&nbsp; (Annex B to Annex E of the petition for certiorari). On 10 July 1957 the complaining union charged the&nbsp; Company&nbsp; with&nbsp; interfering,&nbsp; restraining&nbsp; and coercing its&nbsp; employees&nbsp; in the&nbsp; exercise of their&nbsp; right to self-organization&nbsp;&nbsp; (case No'.&nbsp; 1376-ULP, Annex&nbsp; D).&nbsp;&nbsp; As. agreed&nbsp; upon&nbsp; in the supplementary agreement, the election was held on&nbsp; 16, 17 and 18 July 1957 tinder the supervision of the Department of Labor. However, the counting and&nbsp; canvassing of the ballots cast could not be made because&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Marcelino T. Enriquez, the&nbsp; president&nbsp; of the complaining&nbsp; union, refused to&nbsp; surrender the&nbsp; keys&nbsp; to the ballot boxes,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; for such refusal&nbsp; was the alleged interference with the election&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Laguna Tayabas&nbsp; Bus&nbsp; Company&nbsp; that, made the&nbsp; employees of the Eastern Tayabas&nbsp; Bus Lines vote at&nbsp; the election.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On&nbsp; 22 July 1957 the Laguna&nbsp; Tayabas Bus Company Employees'&nbsp; Association&nbsp; brought an action in the Court of First Instance of Laguna praying for a writ of&nbsp; prohibitory and mandatory injunction against the Balaquezon Transportation Labor Union commanding the last mentioned&nbsp; union to desist from interrupting the work of the Company by staging&nbsp; a strike&nbsp; or otherwise,&nbsp; which, the Company learned&nbsp; from a news&nbsp; item appearing&nbsp; in the Manila Times of&nbsp; 19 July 1957,&nbsp; was impending; Dr. Marcelino&nbsp; T. Enriquez, the president of&nbsp; the labor union,&nbsp; to produce the keys to the ballot boxes; and the Board&nbsp; of Election and Canvassers to proceed immediately with the; counting of the ballots and to announce the result thereof (civil&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; SP-105);&nbsp; On the same day; upon filing of a bond in the sum of P2,000 by&nbsp; the Laguna Tayabas&nbsp; Bus Company&nbsp; Employees' Association,&nbsp; the Court issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte </span>the preliminary writ of&nbsp; prohibitory&nbsp; injunction enjoining the Balaquezon&nbsp; Transportation Labor Union from&nbsp; interfering with and interrupting the&nbsp; work and&nbsp; business of the Laguna Tayabas Bus&nbsp; Company and/ or the Batangas&nbsp; Transportation Company&nbsp; (Annexes&nbsp; F and&nbsp; F-1),&nbsp; In a&nbsp; separate order bearing&nbsp; the same date, the Court directed the&nbsp; Board of Canvassers to count and canvass the ballots and declare the&nbsp; result of the&nbsp; election, warning the&nbsp; members thereof that,&nbsp; should they fail to so count&nbsp; and canvass the ballots&nbsp; as directed, they would be required to appear and show cause why they should not be held&nbsp; in contempt of court&nbsp; (Annex G).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 24 July 1957 the Balaquezon Transportation Labor Union filed in the Court of Industrial Relations a petition for a certification election which is still pending (case No. 474-MC, Annex H). <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Balaquezon&nbsp; Transportation Labor Union comes to this&nbsp; Court by a petition for a&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of certiorari and prohibition with&nbsp; prelimnary injunction to annul the&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; writ of prohibitory injunction issued <i> ex parte </i>by the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Laguna and to enjoin it to proceed with the trial&nbsp; and&nbsp; determination of the case.&nbsp; Upon the filing of&nbsp; a bond&nbsp; in the sum of P1,000 a preliminary writ of injunction was issued.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The Balaquezon transportation Labor Union, the petitioner herein, claims&nbsp; that the&nbsp; preliminary writ of prohibitory&nbsp; injunction issued&nbsp; by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Laguna is&nbsp; illegal and void,&nbsp; for the reason that it was issued without notice and hearing, contrary to the express provision of section 9 (d)&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 875 otherwise known as the Industrial&nbsp; Peace Act&nbsp; which reads in part as follows:&nbsp; <br><blockquote>No court of the Philippines shall&nbsp; have jurisdiction to issue a any or permanent injunction&nbsp; in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, as herein defined <i>except after hearing the testimony of witnesses in&nbsp; open court&nbsp; (with opportunity&nbsp; for cross-examination) in support&nbsp; of the&nbsp; allegations of a&nbsp; complaint made under oath, and testimony in opposition thereto</i> * * * (Italics supplied),<br></blockquote>and that by not&nbsp; complying with&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-quoted procedural&nbsp; requirement,&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; Court&nbsp; was&nbsp; without jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue the aforementioned&nbsp; writ. <br>&nbsp;<br>The respondents Laguna Tayabas&nbsp; Bus Company Employees' Association and the&nbsp; Laguna&nbsp; Tayabas&nbsp; Bus Company, however, counter that the case in the Court of First Instance of Laguna does not involve&nbsp; a labor dispute but the enforcement of the agreement of 6 July 1957 and the supplemental agreement of 9 July 1957 which were entered into by them with the labor union, the petitioner herein, and that for this reason the said Court has jurisdiction to&nbsp; issue <i>ex&nbsp; parte</i>&nbsp; the writ in&nbsp; question&nbsp; pursuant to the exceptional&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of sections 4 and 5, Rule 60, of the Rules of Court.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;There is&nbsp; no doubt that&nbsp; a labor dispute is involved in the case instituted in the&nbsp; respondent Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the very start,&nbsp; there had&nbsp; been&nbsp; complaints&nbsp; filed by the herein petitioner charging the respondent company with unfair labor practices.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, on 25 June&nbsp; 1957 the members of the labor&nbsp; union, petitioner herein,&nbsp; went on&nbsp; strike.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the strike, the agreement of 6 July supplemented by another dated 9 July 1957 was entered into by the&nbsp; parties thereto as an immediate and temporary measure (relief)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for the purpose of stopping in the meantime the strike which had&nbsp; "disrupted the means of transportation&nbsp; in Quezon,&nbsp; Rizal and Laguna&nbsp; provinces.&nbsp; The cessation of the strike as a result of&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; agreements did not terminate or end the labor dispute existing between the petitioner herein and the respondents Laguna Tayabas Bus Company and Laguna Tayabas&nbsp; Bus Company Employees' Association.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many more steps to be taken.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; paragraph 4 of the agreement of 6 July stipulates&nbsp; "that all pending&nbsp; cases&nbsp; in the Court of the Philippines between the parties in&nbsp; connection with these disputes shall be&nbsp; terminated&nbsp; by the&nbsp; parties and&nbsp; withdrawn," yet&nbsp; such stipulation&nbsp; does&nbsp; not mean that&nbsp; there was no longer&nbsp; any labor&nbsp; dispute between&nbsp; the parties thereto. Immediately after the signing of the two agreements,&nbsp; on&nbsp; 10 July 1957 in&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations the herein petitioner charged the respondent Company with interference with the employees' right to self-organization&nbsp; (case No. 1376-ULP,&nbsp; Annex D).&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; the elections on 16,&nbsp; 17 and 18 July 1957, or on 24 July 1957, the herein petitioner filed in the Court of Industrial Relations a petition&nbsp; for a certification&nbsp; election&nbsp; thereby questioning or&nbsp; impugning the result of the elections held on the said dates, despite paragraph 5 of the agreement of 6 July 1957 which&nbsp; provides and stipulates that— <br><blockquote>The parties&nbsp; hereto agree that the winning union shall&nbsp; administer the collective&nbsp; bargaining&nbsp; agreement between the LTB Bus Assn. which shall remain in force until November 13, 1957&nbsp; (when it) shall then be&nbsp; reviewed for modification,&nbsp; <i>provided further that the unions therein represented shall respect the result of the voluntary election and agree that it shall be&nbsp; final.</i> (Italics supplied.) <br></blockquote>&nbsp;Where&nbsp; the contracting labor&nbsp; unions or any of them does not abide&nbsp; by the result of&nbsp; the election,&nbsp; the&nbsp; election thus held to determine which of the two labor unions shall be the exclusive&nbsp; representative of all the employees in the unit to enforce the collective bargaining agreement&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; ineffectual.&nbsp; Clearly,&nbsp; the case at bar&nbsp; involves&nbsp; a labor dispute. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The&nbsp; respondents contend&nbsp; that the refusal of the herein petitioner&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply&nbsp; with its undertaking&nbsp; in&nbsp; the two agreements does not give rise to a labor dispute as defined by law, for&nbsp; the refusal does not concern terms, tenure or conditions of employment between the&nbsp; Laguna Tayabas Bus Company&nbsp; and the Balaquezon Transportation Labor Union; and&nbsp; that a labor dispute can exist only between employees or a&nbsp; labor union and an employer but not between two labor unions.&nbsp; The determination as to which of the&nbsp; two labor unions should take charge and enforce the bargaining agreement of&nbsp; 13&nbsp; November 1954 concluded with the Company is within the definition of the term "labor&nbsp; dispute"&nbsp; which&nbsp; provides that&nbsp; it includes controversy "concerning&nbsp; the association&nbsp; or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange&nbsp; terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether the disputants&nbsp; stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> (1)</sup> <br>&nbsp;<br>Granting that the respondent court had jurisdiction to issue the writ it issued, still it was issued irregularly and, therefore, illegal and void, because the respondent court did&nbsp; not follow&nbsp; and observe&nbsp; the procedure&nbsp; outlined&nbsp; and provided for&nbsp; in section 9(d)&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 875.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The writs of certiorari and prohibition prayed for are granted and&nbsp; the writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; heretofore issued is made final.&nbsp; The preliminary writ of; prohibitory injunction issued <i>ex parte</i> or&nbsp; without hearing by the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Laguna in civil case No. SP-105 is&nbsp; annulled&nbsp; and&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside, without special pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
