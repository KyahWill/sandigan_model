				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Upon an information which charged the above-named accused with the complex 
crime of robbery with rape, after proper proceedings, the Court of First 
Instance of Nueva Ecija found the appellants guilty of said crime and sentenced 
each of them to an indeterminate penalty of from twelve (12) years of 
<em>prision mayor</em> to twenty (20) years of <em>reclusion temporal </em>with 
the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify Pedro Valdez in the sum of 
P130, and to pay the costs. The lower court further sentenced Jacinto Mañacop 
(<em>alias</em> Principe) to recognize any offspring Paulina Valdez may have as 
a consequence of her rape by said appellant.</p>
<p>Upon petition of defendants, the lower court granted a new trial, during 
which Juan Pascua, a fellow detention prisoner of appellants at the provincial 
jail, in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, testified that he and other members of a 
Hukbalahap unit were the ones responsible for the crime of which these accused 
were convicted? but the court did not believe his testimony, and in a resolution 
dated February 10, 1948, reaffirmed its previous decision of August 19, 
1947.</p>
<p>Counsel for the accused appealed from said judgment to the Court of Appeals, 
and the latter in turn, after careful consideration of the case, in a resolution 
promulgated by its Fourth Division, came to the conclusion that, under the set 
of facts proven herein and in view of the attendance of the.aggravating 
circumstances of night-time and the taking advantage by the offenders of their 
public positions, without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same, these 
appellants should have been sentenced by the trial court to life imprisonment, 
and in accordance with the provisions of Section 34 of Republic Act No. 296, the 
Judiciary Law of 1948, it resolved to refrain from entering judgment herein and 
to certify this case to this Court for final determination.</p>
<p>It appears that at about one o'clock In the morning of August 23, 1946, Pedro 
Valdez, who, with his wife and daughter, was residing at Pinagbariohan, 
municipality of Laur, province of Nueva Ecija, was awaken by voices of people 
calling: "tao po, tao po." Valdez got up, lighted a match and saw three persons 
in front of the house, one of whom shouted that all the members of the household 
should come down. Valdez recognized two of those persons, who were standing in 
front of the stairway as municipal policemen of Laur. The third was a total 
stranger to him. The appellant Jacinto Mañacop was carrying a long firearm, 
while Belandres had a short one. Valdez lighted a kerosene lamp and he and his 
family were ordered to come down under threats of being shot. Valdez, his wife 
and daughter Paulina, then about 19 years of age, complied with the order, and 
appellants, in the meantime, covered their faces. While Mañacop was guarding 
Valdez, and the latter's wife and daughter, Belandres went up the house and 
stayed there for about twenty minutes. In the meantime, Mañacop brought Paulina 
to a place about twenty meters distant from the house under a mango tree, and 
taking off his mask, queried Paulina if her father had a gun. When she answered 
in the negative, Mañacop told the girl that she would be shot if she would 
refuse to abide by his wishes. Mañacop pushed her violently and when she felt, 
he untied her drawers and placed himself on top of her and, under threat of 
bodily harm, assaulted her criminally.</p>
<p>It was then that the other accused Belandres came down from the house to 
relieve Mañacop, and Paulina , fearing that the other man who was coming towards 
her from the house might also rape her, fled and escaped, running away until she 
took refuge in the house of a couple, located in the <em>poblacion </em>of Laur. 
When the criminals left the scene of their crime, Valdez and his wife returned 
to their house to find all their things scattered and the sum of P130 missing 
from their trunk. It was already daybreak when their daughter returned home, 
weeping and telling them that she had been outraged by the accused Mañacop.</p>
<p>Under the influence of fear, Valdez did not report the incident immediately 
to the proper authorities. Instead, the next morning he started to build another 
house in the <em>poblacion</em> of Laur, while his family was staying in the 
barrio, but sleeping in the house of a neighbor at night. Even if the new house 
was not yet finished, Valdez moved his family to it after September 2, because 
or that date, the accused Mañacop appeared in the <em>barrio</em> and pelted 
Pedro Valdez with bullets.</p>
<p>The record further shows that a few days afterwards, and upon learning that 
the municipal mayor was looking for him, Valdez went to see the town executive. 
However, the mayor, upon noticing that Valdez, because of fear, could not make a 
full disclosure of what happened to him, referred him to the chief of police for 
further questioning. But Pedro Valdez could not freely state the facts to the 
chief of police on account of the threatening attitude of these two appellants, 
who were then present and were pointing their guns at the offended party during 
the investigation, for which reason, Valdez had to seek cover behind the chief 
of police.</p>
<p>Upon those circumstances, Valdez decided to lodge his complaint with the 
Provincial Fiscal of Cabanatuan, who, in the light of the sworn statements made 
by Valdez and his daughter Paulina, petitioned the Court of First Instance of 
Nueva Ecija that the original complaint be admitted, and the corresponding 
preliminary investigation be conducted by the Court of First Instance. By an 
order issued on September 25, 1946, the Judge of First Instance authorized the 
filing of the information with the Court of First Instance and instructed the 
Justice of the Peace, of Cabanatuan to conduct the necessary preliminary 
investigation and to issue the warrant for the arrest of the defendants.</p>
<p>In this instance, counsel for defendants assigned several errors allegedly 
committed by the trial court concerning its findings.</p>
<p>From the outset, the defense contends that the testimony of Paulina Valdez 
can not be made the basis of the conviction of appellants, because of its 
improbability. Paulina testified that upon reaching the mango tree, Mañacop 
disclosed his identity to her by taking off his mask. It should be taken into 
account that Mañacop was not unknown to her. He had been courting her and 
according to Paulina, she did not reciprocate his feelings towards her on 
account of the fact that he was a married man. Mañacop was, therefore, playing 
the role of a rejected suitor, who, in his desire to humiliate Paulina Valdez, 
and undoubtedly taking advantage of his position as a municipal policeman, 
thought that he could, with impunity, accomplish his evil purpose of ravishing 
the girl who dared to reject his offer of love, by staging a robbery. It is very 
significant that, from the very beginning of the raid, Mañacop paid his 
exclusive attention to his victim Paulina, while his co-accused Belandres went 
up to the house to ransack and rob the same of personal properties and the sum 
of P130 mentioned in the information.</p>
<p>While it is true that it is the right of the accused, through counsel, to 
subject the prosecution witness to rigid questioning in order to bring forth the 
truth, yet the exercise of such right has its limitations. After her ordeal on 
the night of August 23, 1946, the merciless manner in which the 
cross-examination of Paulina Valdez was conducted, when she was quizzed about 
the details of the criminal assault upon her and her subsequent reaction, as if 
she were expected to live over again her terrible experience, has the effect of 
adding insult to injury. Paulina is not a woman of experience or of loose 
morals, but a simple <em>barrio</em> girl, a maiden, the victim of a satyr, who 
could not be reasonably expected that in her distress and abject misery, after 
having been raped, should still think of finding out whether she had any blood 
stains on her clothes or any substance in her body. As aptly remarked by the 
Solicitor General—"Is it reasonable to expect from her so much worldly wisdom 
and experience as to have realized the need of washing herself after she was 
ravished?" And the trial Judge—who could have properly stopped this kind of 
questioning,—after having observed Paulina Valdez on the witness stand, made 
this finding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"En este caso particular, Paulina Valdez, una sencilla campesina, declaro su 
infortunio con una tal sincellez y aire de veracidad, que parecia inspirada tan 
solo por el deseo deseo de decir la verdad; pues no habia ni siquiera hiel en su 
palabra."</p></blockquote>
<p>The sufficiency of the lone testimony of Paulina Valdez to sustain the 
conviction of the accused for the crime of rape, is also attacked by the 
defense. Her testimony is so clear and free from serious contradictions that, as 
ruled in People <em>vs</em>. Dazo (58 Phil. 420), there can be no doubt, In Our 
opinion, of her veracity, particularly in view of the fact that she was 
corroborated by her father Pedro Valdez, who stated that her daughter was taken 
away on the night in question by appellant Mañacop, and when she returned home 
at daybreak the next morning, she wept and told her parents that she had been 
raped by Mañacop. This testimony of Pedro Valdez, according to People 
<em>vs</em>. Momo (56 Phil., 86), may be considered corroborative of that given 
by his daughter.</p>
<p>The lack of physical examination of Paulina Valdez is also alleged by the 
defense fatal to the prosecution. We should not forget that Pedro Valdez and his 
family were practically terrorized by the accused, who were members of the 
police force of their town; We have stated elsewhere in this decision that they 
were subdued by their fear of the offenders, and their feeling was intensified 
by the antagonism shown by the very officials who should have given them 
protection and help in their distress. Lack of; medical examination has been 
held to be not an indispensable element in the prosecution of the crime of rape, 
because according to the doctrine in People <em>vs</em>. Suarez (40 Off. Gaz., 
11th Suppl., No. 15, page 28), it all depends upon the evidence offered and as 
long as such evidence convinces the court, a conviction by the crime of rape is 
proper.</p>
<p>Regarding the defense of alibi put up by appellants, who had the backing of 
almost all of the officialdom of Laur, evidence was presented to the effect that 
these accused were on duty in the municipal building of Laur during the night of 
August 22 until the following morning of August 23. The mayor and the chief of 
police, testifying for the defense, said that at about 10 o'clock on the night 
of August 22, 1946, they went to the municipal building to make their usual 
rounds of inspection, and found the two appellants there. But, according to the 
evidence, the mayor and the chief of police stayed in the municipal building for 
ten or twenty minutes only, and another defense witness said that neither the 
mayor nor the chief of the police came back to the municipal building after the 
10 o'clock inspection of August 22. It appears, therefore, that if these two 
appellants were seen by the mayor or the chief of police in the municipal 
building at about 10 o'clock, their testimonies can not support their alleged 
alibi after their round of inspection in the municipal building. They could not, 
therefore, give credible testimony that these appellants stayed in the municipal 
building during that night until the morning of August 23. On the other hand, we 
have the testimony of appellant Mañacop who said that he mounted guard in the 
municipal building from 8 o'clock to 12 o'clock midnight of August 22 and, from 
then on, he was off duty until 7 o'clock in the morning of August 23. According 
to the evidence for the prosecution, Belandres and Mañacop, with their firearms 
and with another unknown person, visited the house of Pedro Valdez at about 1 
o'clock in the early morning of August 23.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in their efforts to bolster up their alleged alibi, appellants 
presented copies of the police blotter for August 22 and August 23, 1946, But 
instead of supporting their contention, those documents (Exhibit 1-A and 2-A) 
constitute the best refutation of their alibi, because Exhibit 1-A, the copy of 
the police blotter for August 22, 1946, shows that policemen Pulante and 
Agustin were the ones on guard duty in the municipal building from 7 o'clock 
p.m. on August 22 to 7 o'clock a.m. on August 23, while appellants Belandres and 
Mañacop, together with policeman Palara were on patrol from 7 o'clock p.m., of 
August 22 to 12 o'clock a.m., of August 23. </p>
<p>Regarding the apparent delay in the prosecution of this case, while in 
numerous decisions this Court has strongly condemned the unexplained delay in 
instituting a criminal prosecution, because it creates suspicion about the 
motives of the supposed offended party, unless it is explained (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Reyes, 18 Phil., 495; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Cardona, 36 Phil., 438; U. 
S. <em>vs</em>. Pagaduan, 37 Phil., 90; People<em> vs</em>. Gallego et al., 44 
Phil., 192; People <em>vs</em>. Manguiat, 51 Phil., 406), yet it has also been 
ruled in U. S.<em> vs</em>. Briones (28 Phil., 367), that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Such delay, when explained, however, is not sufficient to create a 
reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendants. The law justly provides the 
period within which a criminal action may be brought in most cases. The fact 
that the prosecution did not commence his action earlier is no proof that the 
facts stated in the complaint are not true." (Syllabus.)</p></blockquote>
<p>As already stated, the circumstances surrounding this case are such that, 
although the crime was committed early in the morning of August 23, 1946, the 
criminal action was taken by the prosecution only on September 9, 1946, the date 
of the original information, because of the inability of the offended party to 
secure protection and help from the very officials who were called upon by law 
to extend to Pedro Valdez and his family the facilities which they needed. The 
offenders were officers of the law and had threatened Pedro Valdez and his 
family with bodily harm if they should make a report of their offense to the 
proper authorities. In fact, after the filing of the information by the 
provincial fiscal, the latter had to make the necessary arrangements with the 
Military police in Cabanatuan for the protection and security of the offended 
parties during the pendency of this case in the lower court.</p>
<p>In view of all the above, We have come to the conclusion that these 
appellants are beyond reasonable doubt guilty of the complex crime of robbery 
with rape, defined and penalized in Article 294, paragraph 2 of which it 
provides that "the penalty of <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period 
to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>" shall be Inflicted "when the robbery shall have 
been accompanied by rape * * * ."</p>
<p>The offense under consideration has been perpetrated with the accompaniment 
of the aggravating circumstance of night-time (People <em>vs</em>. Manaba, 58 
Phil., 665) and the taking advantage by the offenders of their public position 
(U. S. <em>vs</em>. Fernandez, 3 Phil., 380), without any mitigating 
circumstance to offset the same. Following, therefore, the recommendation of the 
Solicitor General, the penalty that should be meted out to these culprits shall 
be in the maximum period of that provided in the above-quoted provision of the 
Revised Penal Code, that is, <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p>
<p>Our attention is correctly invited by the Solicitor General, to the fact that 
the trial court failed to provide for the payment of indemnity to Paulina 
Valdez, as provided in No. 1 of Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code, which in 
accordance with the decision rendered in People <em>vs</em>. Feliciano (77 
Phil., 526), should be in the amount of P4,000, the appellant Belandres being 
jointly liable therefor with his co-appellant Mañacop.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it appears that the lower court erred in sentencing 
Mañacop to acknowledge the offspring, if any, of the offended party, pursuant to 
No. 2 of Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code, notwithstanding the fact that he 
is legally prevented from doing so on account of his married status (Civil Code, 
Art. 135). Mañacop is, however, sentenced to support such offspring for which 
the lower court failed to provide (People vs. Mañaba, <em>supra</em>; Civil 
Code, art. 845). </p>
<p>The imprisonment penalty of these appellants is therefore increased, and each 
of them is hereby sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to jointly and 
severally indemnify Paulina Valdez in the sum of four thousand pesos, without 
subsidiary imprisonment on account of the nature of the main penalty. Appellant 
Jacinto Mañacop shall support the offspring, if any, of the offended party. With 
such modifications, the judgment of the lower court is affirmed. With costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor</em>, 
and <em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p>MORAN, C. <em>J</em>.:</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Paras, for the reasons given in this opinion, voted for the 
modifications of the judgment appealed from, but, on account of his being on 
leave at the time of the promulgation thereof, his signature does not appear 
herein. </p></div>
