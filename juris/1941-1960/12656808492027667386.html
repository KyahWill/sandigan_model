				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 20, 1952, plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants in the 
Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro, alleging that on November 12, 1938, 
defendants executed in favor of plaintiff a deed of sale covering a parcel of 
land therein described; that the said land "was erroneously designated by the 
parties in the deed of sale as an unregistered land (not registered under Act 
496, nor under the Spanish Mortgage Law) when in truth and in fact said land is 
a portion of a big mass of land registered under Original Certificate of Title 
No. 6579 in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Oriental Mindoro"; that 
despite persistent demand from plaintiff to have the error corrected, defendants 
have refused to do so. Plaintiff, therefore, prayed for judgment ordering 
defendants to make the aforesaid correction in the deed of sale.
<p>Answering the complaint, defendants denied having executed the alleged deed 
of sale and pleaded prescription as a defense. Traversing the plea of 
prescription, plaintiff alleged, among other things, that he "was without 
knowledge of the error sought to be corrected' at the time the deed of sale was 
executed and for many years thereafter," having discovered the said error "only 
recently".</p>
<p>Without trial on the merits and merely upon motion, the lower court dismissed 
the case on the ground that plaintiff's action had already prescribed. From this 
order plaintiff has appealed directly to this Court.</p>
<p>Both appellant and appellees apparently regard the present action as one for 
the reformation of an instrument under Chapter 4, Title II, Book IV of the new 
Civil Code. Specifically, the object sought is the correction of an alleged 
mistake in a deed of sale covering a piece of land. The action being upon a 
written contract, it should prescribe in ten years counted from the day it could 
have been instituted. Obviously, appellant, could not have instituted his action 
to correct an error in a deed until that error was discovered. There being 
nothing in the pleadings to show that the error was discovered more than ten 
years before the present action was filed on May 20, 1952, while, on the other 
hand, there is allegation that the error was discovered "only recently", we 
think the action should not have been dismissed as having already prescribed 
before the factual basis for prescription had been established and clarified by 
evidence.</p>
<p>We note, however, that appellant's complaint states no cause of action, for 
it fails to allege that the instrument to the reformed does not express the real 
agreement or intention of the parties. Such allegation is essential since the 
object sought in an action for reformation is to make an instrument conform to 
the real agreement or intention of the parties. (Art. 1359, new Civil Code; 23 
R. C. L., par. 2.) But the complaint does not even allege what the real 
agreement or intention was. How then is the court to know that the correction 
sought will make the instrument conform to what was agreed or intended by the 
parties? It is not the function of the remedy of reformation to make a new 
agreement, but to establish and perpetuate the true existing one. (23 R. C. L., 
par. 4, p. 311.)</p>
<p>Moreover, courts do not reform instruments merely for the sake of reforming 
them, but only to enable some party to asserts right under them as reformed. (23 
R. C. L., par. 2). If the instrument in the present case is reformed by making 
it state that the land therein conveyed is already covered by a Torrens 
certificate of title, what right will the appellant, as vendee, be able to 
assert under the reformed instrument when according to himself—or his counsel 
states in his brief—said title is in the name of Torcuata Sandoval, obviously a 
person other than the vendor? Would not the sale to him then be ineffective, 
considering that he would be in the position of one who knowingly purchased 
property not belonging to the vendor?</p>
<p>Perhaps appellant's real grievance is that he has been led to enter into the 
contract of sale through fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the vendor or 
in the mistaken belief that, as stated in the deed, the property he was buying 
was unregistered land. But if that be the case, article 1359 of the new Civil 
Code expressly provides that "the proper remedy is not reformation of the 
instrument but annulment of the contract." Appellant's complaint, however, does 
not ask for the annulment of the deed; neither does it contain allegations 
essential to an action for that purpose.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the order of dismissal must be as it is hereby 
affirmed, not because appellant's action has already prescribed, but because his 
complaint states no cause of action. Without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order affirmed.</em></p></div>
