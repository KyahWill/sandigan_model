				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of  First Instance  of Manila,  dismissing the complaint  of plaintiff and appellant Lucio  Javillonar and absolving defendant and appellee, the Director of Lands, from all liability,  in an action  to  recover from him certain sums said to  have been illegally collected in  excess of the price of the parcel of land bought by plaintiff from the former, at the rate of P25 per square meter. <br><br>Plaintiff and appellant was one of the tenants and occupants of a large parcel of land, "Terrenos  de la  Calle Sande", owned by the Archbishop of  Manila,  which was later acquired by the Philippine  Realty Company,  from which the Rural Progress Administration bought the  same through expropriation.  The other facts of the case, the issues involved and the reason behind the appealed decision are  well and correctly  stated in  said decision penned  by Judge Rafael Amparo, and we quote the same  in full and make it our own: <br><blockquote>"This  is a suit to recover from the defendant a sum of money, alleged to have been illegally collected from  the plaintiff in excess of the price of a piece of land bought by him from the defendant at P25 per  square meter. <br><br>"There is no dispute as to the facts of the case which may be briefly stated as  follows:   <br><br>"On April 5, 1955  plaintiff  bought from the defendant a  lot with an area of 162.6 square meters described as follows: (Description  of the lot, with an area of 162.6 square meters)<br><br>" 'This lot is embraced in the land described in TCT 38540.' at P25 per square meter, or  for  the  sum of P4,065.  Because the plaintiff paid cash, a 10% discount, or P406.50 was allowed and in addition theretofore advanced by the plaintiff was also deducted, leaving a balance of P3,558.50.  To this amount was added the sum of P292.07 for rental of the property for the  period from November 2, 1953 up to February 2, 1955, plus  other incidental expenses aggregating P41.75, so that the total amount paid by the plaintiff to the defendant for said lot amounts to P3,862.57  as per official receipt  Exhibit 1. The land had been  in  possession of the plaintiff long before the same  was acquired by the  government  from its  former owner, and the rental of P292.07 was for the use and enjoyment of  the property by the plaintiff after the  same was acquired by the government.<br><br>"'The plaintiff questions the  right of the  defendant to collect from him the following amounts:</blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Rental ...................................................................................................................</td><td width="27%"> P292.07 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Notarial fee ..........................................................................................................</td><td>10.00 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Deed of sale fee....................................................................................................  </td><td>2.00 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">For registration of  sale plus documentary stamps..................................................  </td><td>29.75</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> <br></td><td>_______</td></tr><tr><td width="11%"> <br></td><td width="62%">Total........................................................................................</td><td>P338.82</td></tr></tbody></table><br><blockquote>"The purchase by  the plaintiff  of this property was made pursuant  to the rules and regulations governing sales of landed estates under the  administration of the Bureau of Lands,  said  regulation being  embodied in  Lands  Administrative  Order No. R—3,  dated October 19, 1951 (Vol. 47,  No. 12, Off. Gaz.,  pp. 1675-1676).  The pertinent provisions  of said rules and regulations for the collection of  rental or fees  for occupation read as follows: <br><br>" 'Moreover, the Director of Lands  shall collect  from the bona fide tenant or  occupant  fees for occupation of the lot  from the  date the estate  was  acquired by the Government until the  date of the execution of the agreement,  to sell in his favor, which,  for  the purpose of these  regulations,  shall be  computed at the  rate  of 6  per  centum of the appraised value of the land.' <br><br>"With respect to  the  expenses incidental to the acquisition and transfer of title, said rules and regulations provided as follows: <br><br>'Upon the full payment  of the purchase price as herein above stipulated  including  all interest thereon  and   the  performance of the conditions hereof by the applicant, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources shall execute a deed of sale conveying the property to the applicant.  All expenses incident to the transfer of title  including the documentary  stamps, notarial  fees and  the issuance of the certificate of  title shall be for the account  of  the applicant.' <br><br>"The price of  the land purchased by the plaintiff is  at P25  per square meter as per agreement between the parties.  Of course,  the additional expenses which had to be borne by the plaintiff were  not included in the computation of the price at P25 per square meter. They are exepenses collected by the  Government in accordance with the rules and regulations governing sales of landed estates. <br><br>"The plaintiff applied for the purchase of said lot, and his application was made in accordance with the same rules and regulations (Lands Adm. Order No. R—3).  Upon  the filing of that application or, at least before the execution of the deed of sale, he was furnished with a statement of  account  showing  the price and incidental  expenses (Exhibit 3),  to which he made no objection.  It is clear, therefore, that from  the time he made the application to purchase the land he  knew about the incidental expenses which he  would have to pay; and even if (he) did not know, his acquisition of the land is  necessarily subject to the rules and regulations governing the sale of landed estates by the Director of Lands and the plaintiff is bound by  said rules and regulations. <br><br>WHEREFORE, judgment  is hereby rendered  dismissing the complaint and absolving the defendant from all liability under the same. With costs against  the plaintiff.  So  ordered."</blockquote>The well written decision above-quoted, in itself, is sufficient  to show the lack of merit of the appeal; but for the satisfaction of appellant, we permit ourselves to say a few words to dispose  of appellant's  arguments in support of his appeal.<br><br>There is  no question  that Lands  Administrative  Order No. R—3 of the Bureau of Lands, under which  the land in question was applied for by appellant and later sold to him, and the  payment  made  of the  purchase price and the other charges  incident to  the  sale,  was  promulgated under  legal authority and has the force of  law. Now, for the first time  in his appeal, appellant assails the constitutionality of said administrative order. Under a settled rule and practice, this  question may well be ignored, not having been raised in the lower court. However, for the satisfaction of the appellant, we may say the following. Appellant cites Section  4, Article XIII, of the Constitution, which provides that: <br><blockquote>"The Congress may authorize upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into  small lots  and conveyed <span style="font-style: italic;">at  cost</span>  to individuals" (Italics supplied).</blockquote>and concludes that by  requiring appellant to pay for the registration of the sale, plus documentary stamps, deed of sale and notarial fee, the Government is selling  the land to him in excess of the  <span style="font-style: italic;">cost</span> as prescribed by the Constitution.  In the first place, as stated in the appealed decision, these charges were mentioned in the Lands Administrative Order under which  he  made the application of purchase and under which the sale was later made to him, and he apparently agreed to the terms of said Order.  In the second place, there is no evidence to show that in making these charges in addition to the price of P25 per square meter, the Government was making any  profit.  There is every reason to believe  that in making the sale at the rate of P25 per square meter plus other charges, the Government was breaking about even,  not making any profit but neither  suffering  any loss, and this must  have been the intention of the Constitutional  provision cited.  The cost therein mentioned is not only the purchase price which the Government pays to owners of landed estates, but also the cost of administration  and of its eventual sale to tenants and occupants, not more but not less. <br><br>Now, as to the collection of  the rental of P292.07, appellant as  tenant had been paying rentals to the former owner of this landed  estate and  it is but  just that he should continue paying said rentals due to the new owner, the Philippine Government, until he  himself  shall have become the owner thereof, with the due execution of the sale therein and the payment of the purchase price, plus the other charges.  It should be borne in mind that  in buying the landed  estate  from the former owner, the Government had  invested a large amount,  and pending subdivision of said estate and sale to the tenants thereon, it should be allowed to collect rentals from  said tenants, at least to reimburse itself for the interest on its investment.<br><br>Appellant invokes the provisions of  Republic  Act No. 1162, presumably to the effect that in case a parcel sought to be occupied by  a tenant cannot be bought  by him, then the same should be  leased to him from month to month, until such time that he is able  to  purchase  the same,  in which event the rental that may be charged by the Government shall not exceed 12 per cent per annum of the assessed valuation of the property. Said  Republic  Act No. 1162 is clearly inapplicable.  The complaint for expropriation initiated by the Government  in  this case was commenced by the Rural Progress Administration on January 30, 1947.  The decision awarding the property  to said Government was promulgated on November 14, 1953 and the payment by the Government was made on June  4, 1954.  The enabling act of the  Rural Progress  Administration was Commonwealth Act No.  378, as amended by Commonwealth Acts Nos. 420 and 539.  On the other hand, Republic Act No. 1162 was enacted  only on June 18, 1954, at a time when the landed estate had already been acquired under and by virtue  of a prior law. What is more, if we were now to apply the provisions of said Republic Act No. 1162  invoked by appellant, he would  be disqualified from purchasing the  lot in  question,  for  the reason that said lot has an area  of 162.6 square meters,  whereas Republic Act No. 1162 limits the area to be acquired by any single tenant to  150 square meters. <br><br>We deem it unnecessary to discuss the other points raised in the appeal. In  view of  the  foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
