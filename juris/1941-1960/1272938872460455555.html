				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. TIMOTEO PENESA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Timoteo Penesa and Rosario Aguillon lived, as husband and wife, in the barrio 
of Marupit, municipality of Camalingan, province of Camarines Sur. Their 
daughter and five children of Rosario by her late husband lived with them. Due 
to continuous wrangles between Timoteo and Rosario's children by her late 
husband, both agreed to part. In pursuance of the agreement and after dividing 
the palav, lumber and firewood between Timoteo and the children of Rosario by 
her late husband, Timoteo left the house on 30 August 1942. Early in the morning 
of the following day, Timoteo returned to the house and asked Rosario to live 
with him in another place (pp. 4, 31, t.s.n.). The request was refused (p. 4, 
t.s.n.). Santiago Cerrado, a cousin of Rosario, came to the house and, upon 
seeing Timoteo, asked the latter why he was there after they had agreed to live 
apart. Angered by this remark, Tiinoteo unsheathed his bolo and assaulted 
Santiago. Crescencio Doro, the eldest son of Rosario, who tried to prevent 
another blow upon Santiago, and.had made a remark similar to that of Santiago 
before the latter came to the house, was also assaulted by Timoteo. At this 
juncture, Rosario went down through the stairway, preceded by Santiago. 
Crescencio and Timoteo grappled for the possession of the bolo and both fell to 
the floor. A brother of Rosario appeared upon the scene and snatched the bolo 
and a dagger from the hands of Timoteo. As a result of the assault upon Santiago 
Cerrado, two wounds were inflicted upon him, one on the left forearm and another 
under the left axilla. They were not serious. Upon Crescencio Doro, the 
following wounds were inflicted: in the left palm affecting two fingers, 3 
inches long and from ½ to ¾ inch deep, which on the day of the trial was still 
bandaged because it was not yet healed; a cut in the skin not 30 deep in the 
left axilla parallel to the left nipple, 3 inches long; a cut above the elbo?; 
of the left arm, 3 inches long and 1/8 inch deep; and another in the right hand 
from the index to the little finger. The one in the left palm which cut the 
joints of the bones was serious and, if the hemorrhage was not stopped, it would 
have resulted in Crescendo's death.</p>
<p>Upon this evidence the trial court found Timoteo Penesa guilty of frustrated 
homicide; and, holding that the mitigating circumstance of passion and 
obfuscation without any aggravating circumstance to offset it concurred in the 
commission of the crime, sentenced him to suffer 6 years and one day of prlsi6n 
mayor, with the accessories of the lav;, and to pay the costs. From this 
judgment he has appealed.</p>
<p>Appellant testifies that on 30 August 1942, Rosario Aguillon agreed to live 
with him in another house; that early in the morning of the following day, he 
returned to the house and sat on a trunk, and not long after Santiago Cerrado 
came and in a loud voice told him to come down because he had nothing left in 
that house, a remark which Santiago repeated when he went up. the house; that he 
answered Santiago that he had a share in the house because he had built it, and 
for that reason he told him that he would not move out; that Santiago took hold 
of him by the hand and forced him to leave immediately; that while he was being 
led by Santiago and pushed toward the kitchen, he was assaulted from behind with 
a piercing weapon, and for that reason he fell down; that when he tried to rise, 
they struck him on the right shoulder and on the head; that he took from the 
partition wall (<em>tabique</em>) a bolo to defend himself; that he struck and 
hit with the bolo all his assailants; that he was further struck on the right 
side of the breast, on the right eye on the neck, and on the cheek; that he fell 
unconscious; and that when he came to he found himself tied to a post. <br></p><p>The 
account given by the appellant of the incident is not worthy of belief. It was 
he who, annoyed and peeved by the interference of Santiago Cerrado and Crescendo 
Doro, assaulted both. There was no reason for the Santiago Cerrado and Crescendo 
Doro to force appellant to leave the house, for after all the latter and Rosario 
Aguillon already had agreed the previous day to live apart. It is incredible 
that he could have gotten hold of the bolo from the partition wall 
(<em>tabique</em>), because the trunk on which he sat was opposite the corner of 
the house where the bolo was kept and the trunk was nearer the door and the 
kitchen than said corner (pp. 46, 47, t.s.n.), and he was being pushed from the 
trunk to the kitchen. He could not have taken the bolo from the place where it 
was kept while he was being pushed towards the kitchen or after falling down. 
There can be no doubt that he had the bolo about his body when he came to the 
house early in the morning of that day. In view of the inherent improbability of 
the appellant's story about the assault of which he claims to have been the 
victim, as testified to by him alone, the version of the incident, as related by 
the three witnesses for the prosecution, which is logical, and reasonable) has 
to be accepted.</p>
<p>The trial court found the appellant guilty of frustrated homicide. This is an 
error. When he went to the house of Rosario early in the morning of 31 August, 
it was not with the intention to. kill anybody, for he went there to entreat 
Rosario Aguillon to live with him in another house. Neither could the remarks 
uttered by Crescendo Doro and Santiago Cerrado have aroused his temper to such 
an extent as to engender the desire and intent to kill them. The finding of the 
trial court is based on the kind of weapon? carried by the appellant when he 
went to the house and on the parts of the victims' bodies at which the weapons 
were aimed, as shown by the wounds inflicted. The bolo with which the appellant 
inflicted the wounds upon Santiago Cerrado and Crescencio Doro was one 
ordinarily used by farm laborers. The dagger was carried for self-defense. The 
wounds inflicted upon the offended parties by the appellant were caused 
indiscriminately and not deliberately. Appellant's purpose in going to the 
house, and not the kind of weapons he carried, nor the parts of the victims' 
bodies on which the wounds were inflicted indiscriminately, is indicative and 
determinative of his intent.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the crime committed by the appellant against 
Santiago Cerrado, in the absence of proof as to the period of the offended 
party's incapacity for labor or of the required medical attendance, is slight 
physical injuries, as provided for in article 266 of the Revised Penal Code; and 
against Crescendo Doro is serious physical Injuries, for, although the physician 
who had treated him did not state in his testimony the time during which the 
wounds would heal or the period during which the offended party would be 
incapacitated to perform his ordinary or usual work, nevertheless the evidence 
shows that the wound inflicted on the 31st of August upon Crescencio Doro in the 
left palm affecting two fingers, 3 inches long and from ½ to ¾ inch deep, was 
not yet cured on the day of the trial held on 9 October 1942, or that the wound 
did not heal within 30 days. Pursuant to article 263, paragraph 4, of the 
Revised Penal Code, and giving the appellant the benefit of the mitigating 
circumstance of passion and obfuscation, taken into consideration in his favor 
by the trial court (article 13, par. 6, Revised Penal Code), the penalty to be 
imposed upon him is six months and 1 day of <em>prision correccional </em>for 
the wounds inflicted upon Crescencio Doro; and 15 days of <em>arresto menor</em> 
for the wounds inflicted upon Santiago Cerrado.</p>
<p>The other points raised by the appellant were passed upon correctly by the 
trial court. Granting that the prosecuting officer did not have a lawful 
appointment, he was at least a <em>de facto</em> officer. The motion for new 
trial was denied properly. The fact that the appellant was detained was no 
obstacle for him to secure witnesses for his defense. He could have secured them 
through his relatives and friends or through compulsory process by giving their 
names to the trial court. The facts set forth in the affidavit filed in support 
of the motion for new trial show that the same are not newly discovered but 
forgotten evidence. If admitted, the facts in the affidavit would contradict 
several points of the appellant's testimony.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is thus modified, with costs in both instances 
against the appellant.</p>
