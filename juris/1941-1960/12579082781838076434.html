				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by defendant Raymundo Abesamis, <em>alias</em> Hading, from a decision 
of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, convicting him, as well as Lope 
Cunanan, <em>alias</em> Commander Perla, and Ruperto Esquillo, <em>alias</em> 
Sergio, <em>alias</em> Alex, who have not appealed, of the crime of kidnapping 
with ransom and sentencing each of them to life imprisonment, with the accessory 
penalties prescribed by law, to indemnify, jointly and severally, Dr. and Mrs. 
Zosimo Fernandez in the sum of P40,000.00, and to pay the proportionate part of 
the costs.
<p>The lower court found, and it is not disputed, that, on April 23, 1953, at 
about 7:30 p.m., Dorotea Fernandez, wife of Dr. Zosimo Fernandez, their daughter 
Fe and the family driver, Buenaventura Fernandez, were forcibly taken from their 
house in Pagsanjan, Laguna, and brought to the mountains by a band of about 
seventeen (17) armed men headed by Lope Cunanan, who was addressed by his men as 
"Capt. Mendoza". While in the hideout of the malefactors, Mrs. Fernandez copied, 
by order of Cunanan, a letter prepared by him and addresed to Dr. Fernandez, 
demanding P80,000.00 for the release of Dorotea, Fe and Buenaventura Fernandez. 
Three (3) days later, the captives were taken further into the mountain 
fastness, where they stayed for thirteen (13) days. On different occasions, 
during this period, Cunanan bade Mrs. Fernandez to write the letters Exhibits C, 
D and E, urging her husband to expedite the raising of the ransom money. 
Moreover, Cunanan, as "Capt. Mendoza", exchanged correspondence with Dr. 
Fernandez with respect to the amount of the ransom money, which was eventually 
reduced to P40,000.00. Upon payment thereof early on May 8, 1953, the captives 
were released.</p>
<p>Although positively identified by Mrs. Fernandez and her driver Buenaventura 
Fernandez (Fe Fernandez did not take the witness stand, for she was abroad at 
the time of the hearing), as one of the armed men who guarded the complainants 
during the entire period of their captivity, Abesamis maintains that the lower 
court erred in convicting him of the crime charged. More specifically, appellant 
contests the sufficiency oi the evidence of conspiracy between him and Cunanan 
to commit said offense, upon the following grounds: (1) the only direct evidence 
thereon is an extrajudicial confession of Cunanan, which is inadmissible in 
evidence against appellant; (2) there is no direct evidence that appellant was 
one of those who forcibly took the Fernandeces from their house in Eagsanjan in 
the evening of April 23, 1953; and (3) it has not been proven that appellant 
knew that the captives had been kidnapped for purposes of ransom. In connection 
with the last argument, it is urged that, as a member of the corps of security 
guards of the Hukbalahap, to which appellant, like Cunanan, as "Capt. Mendoza", 
admittedly belonged, it was the duty of the former to guard the bases of 
operation of said organization, where, presumably, the captives were kept before 
their release, and that, accordingly, the fact he guarded them does not 
necessarily show that he was a privy to the commission of the crime charged.</p>
<p>The record shows, however, that upon being dragged from their house in 
Pagsanjan, on April 23, 1953, at about 7:30 p.m., the Fernandeces and their 
captors, after crossing a river, went afoot to the mountains; that after passing 
by steep trails, at about midnight, they reached a place in the mountains where 
there was an improvised hut among coconut trees; that, placed in said hut, the 
Fernandezes were heavily guarded, not only during that evening, but, also, 
during the entire period of their captivity; and that among those who so guarded 
them was appellant Raymundo Abesamis and his co-defendant Ruperto Esquillo, who 
did not appeal. Although, there is no direct evidence as to the identity of each 
and everyone of the members of the band who went to the house of Dr. and Mrs. 
Fernandez, in the evening of April 23, 1953, except as regards Lope Cunanan, 
there is nothing to indicate that there had been a change, either of the band, 
or in the composition- thereof, at any time during the period above mentioned. 
Indeed, the record suggests that there had been no change in the composition of 
the group, from the midnight of April 23 to the early morning of April 24, when 
Mrs. Fernandez and Buenaventura Fernandez first recognized Abesamis among their 
captors. Moreover, there is evidence to the effect that the same group of men 
guarded the captives from April 24 to May 8, 1953. Again, it has been clearly 
established that the kidnapping was made by Huks under the command of "Capt. 
Mendoza", or Lope Cunanan, and Abesamis admittedly belonged to the Huk 
detachment under such command. In fact, there is no question that the 
Fernandeces were kidnapped for purposes of ransom, in which, accordingly, each 
one of the conspirators had a special interest. Hence, none of them would have 
normally allowed the intervention of a stranger, not only because he could 
jeopardize the success of their plan, as well as their own security, but, also, 
because he would thereby be placed in a position to expect and demand a share in 
the ransom money, and, consequently, reduce the share therein of the original 
conspirators.</p>
<p>The incriminatory statements—to the effect that Abesamis was a member of the 
band that took the Fernandezes from their house in the evening of April 23, 
1953, an4 that he was a party to the conspiracy to commit the crime 
charged—found in Cunanan's extrajudicial statement, merely corroborate the 
testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution and is indicative of their 
veracity.</p>
<p>Anent appellant's last argument, it appears that upon receipt of information 
to the effect that an understanding had been reached with Dr. Fernandez, on May 
7, 1953, there was a general rejoicing in the second hideout of the malefactors; 
that at about 4:00 p.m., the latter proceeded with their captives from said 
hideout to their first hideout, which they reached at about 8:00 p.m.; that, the 
next day, a man came and said: "they are ready, they are there", referring 
evidently to the bearers of the ransom money; that at about 2:00 p.m., the 
malefactors brought the captives down the mountain to a brook, in a slope where 
several friends of the Fernandeces were waiting with a bundle wrapped in a 
plastic cloth; that this bundle was delivered to Mrs. Fernandez, who, following 
instructions said to have been given by Dr. Fernandez, opened the bundle and 
counted the money contained therein; that after verifying that it amounted to 
P40,000.00 Mrs. Fernandez delivered the money to Cunanan who took P10,000.00 for 
himself, gave P6,000.00 to his "lieutenant", and divided the balance among the 
other members of his detachment—<em>including Abesamis</em>; and that after a 
brief wait, the captives were released.</p>
<p>These events, which took place in the presence of Abesamis—particularly, the 
general rejoicing and rather vociferous expressions of happiness made upon 
receipt of notice of the agreement reached with Dr. Fernandez, in the course of 
which the captives were assured that they would soon be released and that 
<em>they would only have to wait for the ransom money, and the share thereof 
actually taken by Abesamis</em>—considered in relation to the other facts 
adverted to above, leave no room for doubt that Abesamis was in conspiracy with 
Cunanan and the other members of his detachment in the commission of the crime 
charged.</p>
<p>Although the same was perpetrated at night time, with the assistance of armed 
men, constituting a band, the maximum of the penalty prescribed by the law 
(Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act No. 18 [the 
crime charged was committed before the approval of Republic Act No. 1084, on 
June 15, 1954]) for said offense—namely death—cannot be imposed upon appellant 
herein, for lack of the number of votes necessary therefor, owing to the fact 
that the head of the tand, Lope Cunanan, had been sentenced to life 
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
appellant Raymundo Abesamis. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Gutterrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
