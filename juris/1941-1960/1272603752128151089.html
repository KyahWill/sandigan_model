				<H3>FORTUNATA VDA. DE RODRIGUEZ, BENJAMIN RODRIGUEZ, MERCEDES RODRIGUEZ DE CRUZ, HERMINIA RODRIGUEZ DE HALLARE, LUZ RODRIGUEZ DE CARLOS AND ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. BIENVENIDO A.

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari seeking to nullify the order 
of respondent Judge dated August 11, 1952, wherein after overruling the 
opposition to the institution of the intestate estate proceedings of the late 
Flaviano Rodriguez, he appointed Abelardo Rodriguez administrator of the estate 
upon filing a bond in the sum of P2,000. 
<p align="justify">It is averred in the petition that Flaviano Rodriguez died on 
February 8, 1944, at Paraiiaque, Rizal, leaving an estate with a value of 
P10,000; that the surviving heirs are the widow, Fortunata Vda. de Rodriguez, 
and six children who are the petitioners and respondent Abelardo Rodriguez; that 
after the death of Flaviano Rodriguez all the heirs, who were then already of 
age, entered into a verbal agreement whereby they agreed not to make a 
liquidation of the estate but to place it under the administration of the widow 
with the understanding that each of the six children would be entitled to 
receive a portion of the income in equal shares from year to year for the needs 
of their families provided that they do not exceed the participation to which 
they are entitled; that on March 19, 1952, or eight years after the death of 
Flaviano Rodriguez, respondent Abelardo Rodriguez filed a petition for 
administration of the intestate estate of said deceased in spite of his 
knowledge that the estate had no debts and all the heirs were of age; that on 
June 2, 1952, the other heirs, petitioners herein, objected to the petition 
invoking the rule that if the estate is free from obligations and the heirs are 
all of age, no administration proceedings shall be allowed; that on August 11, 
1952, respondent Judge, after overruling the opposition, appointed Abelardo 
Rodriguez administrator of the estate upon filing the requisite bond. </p>
<p align="justify">Respondents herein, in answer to the petition, admitted the 
existence of a verbal agreement entered into between the heirs in 1944, wherein 
they agreed not to liquidate the estate and to place it under the administration 
of the widow in view of the unsettled conditions then prevailing at the time, 
but they contend that while that was the understanding the same was not carried 
out because in reality it was Benjamin Rodriguez, one of the petitioners herein, 
who took over the administration of the estate and in the discharge of his 
duties he failed and refuse to give to respondent Abelardo Rodriguez his share 
in the income which he badly needed for the support of his family, for which 
reason he started the intestate proceedings which gave rise to the present 
petition for certiorari. </p>
<p align="justify">The issue to be determined is whether respondent Judge acted 
properly in maintaining the administration proceedings and in appointing 
Abelardo Rodriguez as administrator of the estate notwithstanding the fact that 
the estate has no debts and all the heirs entitled to share in its distribution 
are all of age.</p>
<p align="justify">Under section 1, rule 74 of the Rules of Court, if the decedent 
left no debts and the heirs are all of age, or the minors are represented by 
their judicial guardians, the parties may, without securing letters of 
administration, divide the estate among themselves as they see fit, and should 
they disagree, they may do so in an ordinary action of partition.</p>
<p align="justify">Construing the scope of said section 1, (formerly section 596, 
Act No. 190), this Court repeatedly held "that when a person dies without 
leaving pending obligations to be paid, his heirs, whether of age or not, are 
not bound to submit the property to a judicial administration, which is always 
long and costly, or to apply for the appointment of an administrator by the 
court. It has been uniformly held that in such case the judicial administration 
and the appointment of an administrator are superfluous and unnecessary 
proceedings" (Ilustre vs. Alaras Frondosa, 17 Phil., 321; Malahacan vs. Ignacio, 
19 Phil., 434; Bondad vs. Bondad, 34 Phil., 232; Baldemor vs. Malangyaon, 34 
Phil., 367; Fule vs. Fule, 46 Phil., 317; Utulo vs. Pasion de Garcia, 66 Phil., 
302). </p>
<p align="justify">It, therefore, appears from said section 1, as construed by 
this Court, that when the estate has no pending obligations to be paid, his 
heirs, whether of age or not, are not bound to submit the property to a judicial 
administration, for the reason that it is superfluous or unnecessary, and in 
most cases long and costly, in which case the way left to the heirs is to divide 
the estate among themselves as they may see fit, and should they disagree, they 
may do so in an ordinary action of partition. But, is this pattern mandatory 
upon the heirs? Should the heirs be unable to agree on a settlement of the 
estate, do they have to resort necessarily to an ordinary action of partition? 
Can they not choose to institute administration proceedings? </p>
<p align="justify">Our answer is that section 1 does not preclude the heirs from 
instituting administration proceedings, even if the estate has no debts or 
obligation, if they do not desire to resort for good reasons to an ordinary 
action of partition. While section 1 allows the heirs to divide the estate among 
themselves as they may see fit, or to resort to an ordinary action of partition, 
it does not compel them to do so if they have good reasons to take a different 
course of action. Said section is not mandatory or compulsory as may be gleaned 
from the use made therein of the word <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span>. If the intention were otherwise the 
framer of the rule would have employed the word <span style="font-style: italic;">shall</span> as was done in other 
provisions that are mandatory in character. Note that the word <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> is used not 
only once but in the whole section which indicates an intention to leave the 
matter entirely to the discretion of the heirs. </p>
<p align="justify">The inquiry before us is not new. In a case where one of the 
heirs chose to institute administration proceedings in court, even if the estate 
had no debts, and the widow sought to dismiss the case invoking in support of 
her contention the doctrine enunciated in the cases already adverted to, this 
Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The principal ground of the opposition is that the heirs being 
of legal age, and there being no proof that there is any valid and effective 
credit against the deceased, no legal reason exists for the court to appoint an 
administrator, as prayed for in the petition, citing in support of this 
contention the doctrine enunciated in the cases of Ilustre vs. Alaras Frondosa 
(17 Phil., 321); Bondad vs. Bondad (34 Phil., 232); Ealdemor vs. Malangyaon (34 
Phil., 367).</p>
<p align="justify">It is true that, under section 596 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, whenever all the heirs of a person who died intestate are of lawful 
age and legal capacity, and there are no debts due from the estate, or all the 
debts have been paid, the heirs may, by agreement duly executed in writing by 
all of them, and not otherwise, apportion and divide the estate among 
themselves, as they may see fit, without court proceedings. But there is 
nothing' in this section which prohibits said heirs from instituting special 
proceedings for the administration of the intestate estate if they cannot agree 
on the extrajudicial partition and apportionment of the same." (Orozco vs. 
Garcia, 50 Phil., 149, 151.) </p></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">In this particular case, however, we find that the core of 
petitioners' objection is not that the heirs have erroneously instituted these 
administration proceedings but that the court erred in appointing Abelardo 
Rodriguez administrator of the estate. It is claimed that Abelardo Rodriguez was 
appointed administrator without the petitioners having been given an opportunity 
to be heard. But this claim has no basis it appearing that the parties had been 
duly heard before the court issued its order now complained of. It appears that 
both parties had submitted the names of the persons they wanted to be appointed 
as administrator and, the court made its choice only after weighing the fitness 
and qualifications of the persons recommended. Thus, on this point, the court 
said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The petitioner in this case appears to be fully qualified to 
act as administrator of the estate of the deceased Flaviano Rodriguez, and does 
not possess any of the disqualifications. Moreover, he is one of the heirs left 
by the deceased. Inasmuch as none of the oppositors appear to be more qualified 
to act as administrator of the estate, the Court is inclined to grant the 
petition presented by Abelardo Rodriguez." (Annex D). </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The petition is dismissed, with costs. The preliminary 
injunction issued is hereby dissolved.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo,</span> and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Labrador, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
