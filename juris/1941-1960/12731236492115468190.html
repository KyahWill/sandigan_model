				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On August 21, 1952, defendants-appellants Victoriano L. Reyes and Adela 
Enriquez mortgaged to plaintiff-appellee Lorenzo Lerma a parcel of land and the 
improvements thereon located at R. Hidalgo Street, Quiapo, Manila, described in 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 77930 of the Office of the Register of Deeds 
for the City of Manila, for the sum of P70,000, with interest at the rate of 12 
per cent per annum, the interests for the months of August, September, and 
October, 1952, payable at the execution of the contract, and the succeeding 
monthly interests on the first day of every month, the mortgage to expire on 
August 1, 1953, unless extended to another year if the mortgagors would have 
complied with all its provisions (Exh. "A"). The mortgage contract was duly 
registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds.<p></p>
<p>Defendants-appellants paid the interests for the months of August 1, 1952 to 
June 1953 and thereafter failed to pay further interests or the principal loan. 
Whereupon, plaintiff-appellee filed this action on May 6, 1954 in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila for the payment of the mortgage debt of P70,000, the 
accrued interests of 7,700, the fire insurance premiums on the mortgaged 
property of P937.50, or a total of P78,637.50, plus attorney's fees in the 
amount of P7,000 and costs, and upon failure of defendants to pay these amounts, 
for the foreclosure of the property mortgaged. Defendants-appellants answered 
admitting the loan and the mortgage but claiming the defense that plaintiff had 
given them an indefinite extension of time to pay the loan by allowing them to 
look for purchasers for the mortgaged property and promising not to file any 
action in court while they were looking for buyers; and asked for the dismissal 
of the complaint and the payment of damages allegedly suffered because of the 
premature filing of the action.</p>
<p>After trial, the lower court found that although plaintiff had given 
defendants an extension of time to pay the interests due for the months of May 
to September, 1953, he did not extend the period for the payment of the 
principal loan of P70,000, with the effect that the capital and the accrued 
interests became due one year from August 1, 1952; and that assuming that 
defendants had been given the opportunity to look for buyers for the mortgaged 
property, they could still do so within three months after judgment is rendered 
and before the property is sold at foreclosure sale. Consequently, the court 
ordered defendants to pay plaintiff the sum of P70,000, with interests at 12 per 
cent per annum from July 1, 1953 until full payment, as well as the sum of 
P2,000 as attorney's fees and costs; and the foreclosure of the mortgaged 
property in case defendants failed to satisfy the judgment within 90 days. In 
another order, the court also required defendants to pay plaintiff the amount of 
P937.50 representing insurance premiums paid by the latter on the mortgaged 
property, having found that defendants had agreed to reimburse plaintiff for the 
same. From this judgment and order, defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, 
which forwarded the case to us because the amount involved is beyond its 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Defendants-appellants urge:</p>
<p>(1) that the mortgage contract had been extended to another year or up to 
August 1, 1954, so that plaintiff-appellee's action was premature; and</p>
<p>(2) that the lower court erred in not allowing them to amend their answer so 
as to allege payment of usurious interest.</p>
<p>Under their first argument, appellants point to the following document signed 
and delivered to them by plaintiff-appellee :</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"October 19, 1953</p>
<p>"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</p>
<p>This is to certify that Mr. Victoriano L. Reyes secured a mortgage loan to 
his property located at 1074 E. Hidalgo Street, Quiapo-Manila from the 
undersigned in the amount of P70,000.00 at the rate of twelve (12%) per cent per 
annum on August, 1952.</p>
<p>That Mr. Reyes has been paying continuously his interest obligation since the 
above date of contract.</p>
<p>That the interest due for the months of May to September, 1953, has been used 
by Mr. Reyes and at my instance and permission for the necessary improvements of 
his property under mortgage and for the operation of his business as well." 
(Exh. "1").</p></blockquote>
<p>and claim that as the deed of mortgage Exh. "A" stipulates that its term of 
one year could be extended for another year, the fact that appellee, by the 
above document, gave them an indefinite extension of time to pay the interests 
on the loan in question for the months of May to September, 1953, and did not 
file the action for foreclosure at the expiration of one year from August 1, 
1952, implied that payment of the principal loan had likewise been extended for 
another year, or up to August 1, 1954. </p>
<p>The above claim is patently without merit. Under the terms of the above 
document Exh. "1", all that was excused was the time for the payment of the 
interests that became due for the months of May to September, 1953. The 
implication of this extension is simply that the mortgage had waived his right 
to demand foreclosure for failure of appellants to pay the monthly interests as 
they fell due from May to September, 1953. No extension of the term for the 
payment of the principal loan was given, as appellant Victoriano Reyes himself 
admitted in the court below (t.s.n. December 13, 1954, p. 13), hence, the loan 
matured and became demandable, under the terms of the mortgage deed, on August 
1, 1953, and the mortgagee could have filed foreclosure proceedings on that date 
or any time thereafter to collect the principal loan as well as all accrued 
interests thereon. The fact that appellee postponed his action and did not file 
it upon the maturity of the loan on August 1, 1953 does not mean, again, that he 
had extended the term or period of the mortgage for another year. The mere 
failure on the part of the creditor to demand payment after the debt has become 
due does not constitute an extension of the term of the obligation (Art. 2079, 
New Civil Code; Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank vs. Aldecoa, 30 Phil., 255), for 
novation must be express (Art. 1292, supra) and can not merely be inferred or 
implied from the creditor's silence, leniency, or inaction (Banco Espa√±ol vs. 
Donaldson, 5 Phil., 418, 423; Shannon and Shannon vs. Phil. Lumber and 
Transportation Co., 61 Phil., 872). </p>
<p>And even assuming that the term of the mortgage had indeed been extended for 
another year, still plaintiff-appellee had the right to institute foreclosure 
proceedings before the expiration of the extended period, since appellants 
admittedly had completely failed to pay the monthly interests from November, 
1953 up to the filing of the action on May 6, 1954, and under the terms of the 
deed of mortgage Exh. "A", "the failure of the mortgagors to comply with any 
condition of this real estate mortgage, especially the nonpayment of the 
interests within six months from any due date, shall cause the obligation to 
become immediately demandable and foreclosure proceed, mgs may then be 
instituted by the mortgagee herein".</p>
<p>Coming now to appellants' second argument, it appears that they asked 
permission to amend their answer so as to include therein the allegation of 
payment of usurious interest only after plaintiff had already presented his 
evidence and rested his case. The lower court did not " abuse its discretion 
when it refused to allow the proposed amendment, because to do so would have had 
the effect of unnecessarily prolonging the trial, there being no reason why the 
defense of usury was not pleaded in the original answer. Besides, the suggested 
amendment consists merely in the supposed payment by appellants of interest to 
plaintiff for three months in advance. Even if the answer had been amended and 
appellants had proved the truth of this allegation, plaintiff would still have 
not acted in violation of the Usury Law, which allows collection of interest for 
one year in advance as long as it does not exceed the lawful rates fixed therein 
(section 6, Act 2655, as amended). No reversible error was, therefore, committed 
by the trial court when it denied appellants' motion to amend their answer.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
appellants Victoriano L. Reyes and Adela Enriquez. So ordered.</p>
<p><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</p>
