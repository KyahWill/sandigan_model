				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Santiago Briz,  Ricardo  Reyes, Marciano Bondad,  and Eusebio Hernandez were jointly accused of murder in the Court of First Instance of  Laguna for the death of Toribio Sungcaya.   After trial, the lower court absolved Santiago Briz and Marciano  Bondad  for insufficiency of evidence but found guilty  Ricardo  Reyes and Eusebio Hernandez and sentenced each of them to life imprisonment, to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of  P6,000,  and to  pay proportionately the  costs. From this decision, only Eusebio Hernandez has appealed.<br><br>In the afternoon of April 13, 1955, at about five o'clock, Doroteo Escueta and Eleuterio Victoria, the first riding on a carabao and  the second on a cew,  took their animals to a drinking place near the  Apasan bridge,  Calauan, Laguna.   They met Ricardo Reyes and Eusebio  Hernandez, who  were both armed, standing at  the end of the bridge while at a short distance from them was another group composed of Marciano Bondad, Santiago Briz and Gregorio Anciado, who were also armed.   Ricardo Reyes inquired from them where they could find  Toribio Sungcaya  to which they answered that they did not know. <br><br>At about six to six-thirty o'clock of the same afternoon, another group  composed of Ambrocio Sungcaya, Modesto Escueta, Doroteo Vergara, Daniel Onate, Felix Onate and Anacleto Decano left barrio Apasan to serenade somewhere in Alaminos and  while walking on a single file, they heard the detonation  of three or four shots of a firearm.  They proceeded on their way and while approaching the Apasan bridge, they  met Ricardo Reyes, Marciano Bondad, Eusebio Hernandez, Gregorio Anciado and Santiago Briz, who were all armed,  coming from the opposite direction and walking at a brisk pace.  And  upon reaching the bridge they came upon the lifeless body of a person lying prostrate on the ground face up who turned out to be Toribio Sungcaya.  Two of the serenaders went to the municipal building of Calauan to report the matter to the police authorities while the rest  returned to barrio  Apasan to notify the relatives of the deceased, and at about half an hour later, the authorities and the relatives repaired to the place of the gruesome discovery.  The  corpse was taken  to the municipal building of Alaminos and after an autopsy performed by a municipal health officer,  it was transferred to the family residence.  The autopsy shows that the deceased sustained four mortal gunshot wounds which caused instantaneous  death due to profuse hemorrhage. <br><br>It appears that prior to the incident one Manuel Libang complained to the chief of police of Alaminos that he lost his carabao.  The chief of police asked the deceased who was then the  barrio lieutenant of Apasan to help in locating  the whereabouts of the animal. Because of his efforts the  four accused  herein were apprehended and charged with stealing the animal and this intervention was resented by them.  Appellant admitted that were it  not for the deceased, he would not have been dragged into the case.                                                         <br><br>Appellant set up alibi as a defense.  He claims that between five to seven o'clock in the evening of the day  the lifeless body was found near Apasan bridge,  he went to  the house of  one Tranquilino Ulan  in  barrio Linao to  see a carpenter,  Anacleto de Cano, who  was  working thereat, for the purpose of having him measure the window of his house so that he could purchase the frame of  the window  from San Pablo City; that he stayed there up to  7:00 o'clock in the evening when he returned home; that later he  heard  the news of the death of Toribio Sungcaya;   that he joined the relatives  of the deceased when they  proceeded to the place where his body was found and he even accompanied them in taking the corpse to the municipal building of Alaminos and later to their residence in  barrio Apasan.  His testimony was corroborated by Anacleto de  Cano and Daniel Belga.                       <br><br>There is no  dispute that Toribio Sungcaya died in the evening in question as a result of gunshot wounds inflicted  on his body, and there can be no question that among those  who participated in the killing are appellant and Ricardo Reyes who, while no one actually saw the shooting or aggression,  were however identified by  eyewitnesses  as among those who were  seen going towards the Apasan bridge minutes before the detonation of  the shots was heard and left the place thereafter in a hurry  as though fleeing from an ontoward happening. Moreover, the evidence shows that after appellant's apprehension, he and his  co-accused  Ricardo Reyes were  investigated by the police authorities and  in  the  course  of the investigation they  subscribed to written statements wherein they  admitted that the deceased  was killed by a group of persons including themselves and that the motive  of the  killing was that they suspected that the deceased reported to  the authorities that they were the ones who were responsible for the loss of the carabao  of  one Manuel Libang; that in the afternoon of  Apirl 13, 1955 they went to Apasan bridge and  waited for the deceased;  and that  at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening, while the deceased was on the bridge on his way home, he was fired upon twice by Ricardo Reyes and  his companions.   There can therefore be no doubt that appellant is one of those who took part in the shooting of the deceased. <br><br>His  defense of alibi  cannot be sustained.  In the first place, if his only purpose in going to the house of Tranquilino Ulan in  barrio Limao was to ask a  carpenter to measure the window of his house, it would seem strange for him to stay  in the  house for almost two  hours, a circumstance  which makes his claim  suspicious or a mere pretext to exculpate himself from liability.   In the second place, his presence near the scene of the crime  has been established by eyewitnesses for he has been identified as one of those who went to the Apasan bridge carrying a firearm minutes before  the shooting and leaving  the place thereafter  in a  hurry under  suspicious circumstances. And finally, after he was apprehended, he made  an extrajudicial confession wherein he admitted his participation in the killing.  It is a well-known rule that a defense of alibi cannot be given  credence when the identity of the accused is established by  evidence which leaves no doubt as to his guilt.<br><br>The claim that appellant deserves acquittal for the reason that he did not  fire a shot at the deceased and there is no evidence of conspiracy among appellant and  his co-defendants cannot be sustained.  It is true that the trial court observed that there was no evidence of conspiracy to hold defendants Marciano Bondad  and Santiago Briz responsible for the acts of their  co-accused, but this observation refers  exclusively  to said two  accused for  which reason they  were absolved from the information.   The trial court did not mean to refer to appellant and his co-accused Ricardo Reyes for as to them conspiracy has been established. This is clearly evidenced by their admission in their written confessions to the effect that they, together with their co-accused, conspired to take the life, of Toribio Sungcaya.  Even if it may therefore appear from his confessions that he has not fired any shot at the deceased, he is however responsible for the consequences of the act of his co-accused Ricardo Reyes.  <br><br>Neither can  appellant's claim that his written statements in  connection with the killing are inadmissible in evidence for having been  obtained by  threat and torture be sustained,  for such is  belied not only by his own admission before a  constabulary  officer but by  the  very  officials before whom he signed said confessions.  We refer to the Justice of the Peace of Calauan and the Municipal Judge of Lipa  City who testified that appellant voluntarily  executed them and  never protested against the duress he now complains of.  The injuries which appellant  claims to have suffered while confined  in the constabulary barracks were sustained by him not in connection with his confessions but when he attempted to escape. Indeed, it   is very unlikely that the officers would torture him in the very presence of his relatives as claimed by the defense.  <br><br>Premises considered, we find that the decision of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> is supported by law and the evidence,  and so  we affirm the same, with costs against appellant.       <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
