				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On July 4,&nbsp; 1953, at about 3:30&nbsp; a.m., the lifeless body of Domingo T. Vengco was found,&nbsp; with ten stab wounds, on Dakota Street, near the Rizal Memorial&nbsp; Stadium, City of Manila,&nbsp; by policeman Bernabe of Precinct No. 4 of the Manila&nbsp; Police Department, who immediately&nbsp; report the matter&nbsp; to&nbsp; Lt. Dujua of the&nbsp; Homicide Squad, Detective Bureau, MPD.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, Lt. Dujua together with Detective Corporal Saturnine&nbsp; Villasin&nbsp; and Sgta. Bulaklak,&nbsp; Walker and Turiñgan repaired to&nbsp; the place and found the&nbsp; body of the&nbsp; deceased sprawled on&nbsp; the&nbsp; street. There, Lt. Dujua ordered that photographs of the dead body be taken and,&nbsp; after the picture-taking, the party searched it but found nothing.&nbsp; The killing remained&nbsp; a mystery for almost a month, until August 1,&nbsp; 1953, when one Bonifacio Castro,&nbsp; a driver by profession,&nbsp; unable to withstand the impelling urge of his conscience, spontaneously went to the Manila Police Department to give information of what he knew about the matter.&nbsp; He then narrated that between 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning of July 4, 1953, a person whom&nbsp; he&nbsp; later identified&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Domingo&nbsp; T. Vengeo, boarded his jeepney at the corner of P. Paterno St. and Quezon Blvd., Quiapo, and sat at the rear right seat; that subsequently&nbsp; three other&nbsp; persons, known&nbsp; to him by their nicknames,&nbsp; whom&nbsp; he later&nbsp; on identified as the defendants, also&nbsp; boarded his jeepney; that defendant Lorenzo Magallanes sat beside&nbsp; him in the front seat, while defendants Manuel Abrina&nbsp; and&nbsp; Norberto Ano sat on the left side&nbsp; of the jeepney&nbsp; behind him,&nbsp; and with&nbsp; these" four passengers he&nbsp; proceeded on his&nbsp; way to Pasay; that on passing&nbsp; the corner of Taft Avenue and&nbsp; San&nbsp; Andres, he heard&nbsp; Norberto Ano and&nbsp; Manuel Abrina whispering to each other; that upon reaching Dakota St., near a midden shed before reaching the Rizal Memorial Stadium, he was ordered to stop by&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Magallanes&nbsp; who&nbsp; gave him 30 cents for the fare of the three who&nbsp; alighted at that place; that defendant&nbsp; Ano pulled&nbsp; the hands&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased Vengco forcing him to come down; that after the deceased has alighted from the jeepney, he saw defendant Ano give a fist blow to Vengco which&nbsp; landed&nbsp; either on his face or breast while&nbsp; defendants Magallanes&nbsp; and Abrina were behind Ano; that&nbsp; when he&nbsp; saw&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; fall to the ground after being socked by defendant Ano, he got scared and drove his jeepney away to Pasay where&nbsp; he went to a restaurant&nbsp; to take&nbsp; a snack&nbsp; and purchased a can of milk for his child,&nbsp; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; went&nbsp; home.<br><br>Upon receiving the foregoing information, the Police Department of Manila tried its best to arrest the defendants and, on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 2, 1953,&nbsp; Manuel Abrina was arrested and brought to the MPD&nbsp; for investigation.&nbsp; He denied his participation in the crime, but upon being lined up together with 14 other persons and confronted with Bonifacio Castro, the latter readily identified him as one of those who boarded his jeepney&nbsp; and alighted with his co-defendants near the Rizal Memorial&nbsp; Stadium early in the morning of July 4, 1953.&nbsp; Thereupon,&nbsp; on August 3, 1953,&nbsp; the Fiscal of Manila, after proper&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation, filed an information for robbery and homicide against Manuel Abrina and his other companions who were still at large and whose true names were not yet&nbsp; known.<br><br>On&nbsp; August 4,&nbsp; 1953, defendant Norberto Ano&nbsp; was apprehended&nbsp; and&nbsp; brought&nbsp; to the&nbsp; MPD&nbsp; for investigation. As he&nbsp; also denied his participation in the commission of the crime, he was lined up with 18 other persons and when Bonifacio was called, the latter identified&nbsp; him as one of the three passengers&nbsp; that boarded his jeepney and the one who pulled down the deceased when they alighted&nbsp; near the Rizal Memorial Stadium.<br><br>Finally, on August 6,1953, defendant Lorenzo Magallanes was also arrested and when lined up together with 19 other persons, he was also identified by Castro as the companion of Ano and Abrina.&nbsp; This&nbsp; defendant also denied his participation in the crime at bar, but later on he executed an affidavit (Exhibit E) wherein he&nbsp; stated:<br><blockquote>"That in the morning of July 4, 1953,&nbsp; lie boarded a jeepney at Quiapo with his co-accused; that he&nbsp; did not&nbsp; stab&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased Domingo T. Vengeo; that it was Abrina,&nbsp; alias Neggi,&nbsp; who stabbed Veng-co, helped by Norberto&nbsp; Ano,&nbsp; alias Toto,&nbsp; who took away the things&nbsp; of the victim; that&nbsp; thereafter, they went&nbsp; to&nbsp; Pasay City, where,&nbsp; before separating", Abrina gave him 50¢ as faro money and told him that they would meet the following&nbsp; morning&nbsp; at the store of Mang Totoy at Leveriza; that they met in that place and drank tuba; that Abrina gave him P2, saying that little money had been realized from the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of the&nbsp; things&nbsp; takon&nbsp; from the deceased,' that he was present&nbsp; at the place of&nbsp; stabbing; that he&nbsp; did not complain when he received only P2 from&nbsp; Abrina; that in the jeepney he took the front seat beside the driver,&nbsp; but&nbsp; could not remember the places where his companions and Vengco sat at the rear of the jeepney; that he did not see&nbsp; what kind of instrument&nbsp; Abrma used in stabbing- the victim, but he saw Abrina pull out something&nbsp; from his pocket."</blockquote>After the arrest of Ano and Magallanes, the information was, by leave of court, amended to allege therein the true names of these&nbsp; defendants.<br><br>After due trial, the lower court found the&nbsp; defendants guilty&nbsp; of the crime of robbery with homicide, as charged in the information, with the aggravating circumstances of&nbsp; nocturnity and abuse of&nbsp; superior&nbsp; strength&nbsp; and&nbsp; the further aggravating circumstance of recividism as against accused Manuel Abrina,&nbsp; and sentenced them to suffer the supreme penalty of death, and each and&nbsp; everyone of them to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased Domingo Vengco&nbsp; in the sum of P6,000 and in&nbsp; the&nbsp; further sum of P275, the value of the stolen properties, and to pay 1/3%&nbsp; of&nbsp; the costs of&nbsp; the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in view of the penalty imposed&nbsp; by the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; and the appeal interposed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; defendants, the case&nbsp; was elevated&nbsp; to this Court&nbsp; for&nbsp; final decision.<br><br>Defendants Manuel Abrina and Lorenzo Magallanes appealed from the decision claming that the trial court erred in finding them guilty of robbery with homicide beyond reasonable doubt and in imposing upon them the supreme penalty of death,<br><br>Defendant Norberto Ano also appealed from the decision contending that&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court erred&nbsp; "in finding him guilty of&nbsp; the crime charged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the information because (a)&nbsp; the testimony of&nbsp; Bonifacio&nbsp; Castro&nbsp; is inherently improbable,&nbsp; highly suspicious and contrary to the ordinary course of&nbsp; human conduct; (b) the defense of alibi set&nbsp; up by him has been sufficiently substantiated by uncontradicted and&nbsp; credible&nbsp; evidence;&nbsp; and (c) even if the testimony&nbsp; of the witnesses for the prosecution were true, still&nbsp; proof is hopelessly wanting as&nbsp; to the author or authors of the crime of robbery with homicide."<br><br>In their briefs, the appellants do not dispute the perpetration&nbsp; of the crime alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the information, to wit, robbery with homicide,&nbsp; of which&nbsp; the deceased Domingo T. Vengco was the victim; neither do they assail the finding of the lower&nbsp; court, fully supported by the evidence&nbsp; on record,&nbsp; that&nbsp; early&nbsp; in&nbsp; the morning&nbsp; of&nbsp; July 4,&nbsp; 1953, the deceased Domingo T. Vengco was killed at&nbsp; the time and place mentioned above, and&nbsp; robbed and taken&nbsp; from him his ring valued at P60, a Parker fountain pen worth P20 and&nbsp; a wristwatch worth P150,&nbsp; it&nbsp; having&nbsp; been&nbsp; proven, through the testimony of David&nbsp; Martinez, that when the deceased boarded a jeepney on his way to Pasay, he had with him&nbsp; a Parker 51&nbsp; fountain pen, a diamond&nbsp; ring, rimless glasses and a watch,&nbsp; and thru the testimony of Irene Tayson, mother of the&nbsp; deceased,&nbsp; that the eyeglasses were worth P45, the ring P60, the fountain pen&nbsp; P50: and the watch P150;&nbsp; and,&nbsp; thru&nbsp; the testimony of witness Villasin, that&nbsp; when the lifeless body of Vengco was found by him, all these articles were missing-. Their principal contention is that the evidence on record does not warrant their conviction because there was no direct evidence&nbsp; clearly showing that they have killed the deceased Vengco and&nbsp; robbed him.&nbsp;&nbsp; They vigorously claim that the testimony&nbsp; of Bonifacio Castro, linking them with the crime at bar, deserves no credit for it is highly unreliable and that, even&nbsp; granting all his&nbsp; declarations to be true, still they do not prove that the herein appellants were&nbsp; the ones&nbsp; who took&nbsp; the&nbsp; life of the deceased and&nbsp; carted away&nbsp; the&nbsp; property he had&nbsp; with him when he was killed.<br><br>Five&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; testified&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; namely, Bonifacio Castro, Abelardo&nbsp; Lucero, David Martinez, Irene Tayson&nbsp; and Saturnino Villasin.<br><br>Bonifacio&nbsp; Castro's&nbsp; testimony,&nbsp; as&nbsp; found&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court, is as follows:<br><blockquote>"That he&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver of a&nbsp; jeepney bearing plate&nbsp; TPU-919); that&nbsp; the deceased&nbsp; Vengco boarded that&nbsp; jeepney&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; corner&nbsp; of Quezon&nbsp; Blvd. and&nbsp; P. Paterno&nbsp; St.,&nbsp; Quiapo, Manila;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Vengco was the only passenger; that he did&nbsp; not&nbsp; immediately proceed on his&nbsp; way&nbsp; to&nbsp; Pasay City,&nbsp; but instead waited for other passenger; that&nbsp; five&nbsp; minutes&nbsp; thereafter,&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein three&nbsp; accused&nbsp; Manuel Abrina y Montano, Norberto Ano&nbsp; and&nbsp; Lorenzo&nbsp; Magullanes,&nbsp; boarded Castro's jeepney.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the light&nbsp; on the ceiling of the jeepney, Castro recognized the herein three accused.&nbsp; He recognized them as three characters he used to see hanging1 around Leveriza&nbsp; St., Pasay City.&nbsp; In fact, he recalled Abrina as 'Neggie".&nbsp;&nbsp; Lorenzo Magallanes took the front scat with Castro.&nbsp; Abrina and Ano took the rear seat.<br><br>"After his four&nbsp; passenger&nbsp; had&nbsp; taken&nbsp; their&nbsp; respective seats, Bonifacio Castro&nbsp; proceeded on his way toward&nbsp; Pasay City.&nbsp; On the way to Dakota St.,&nbsp; Bonifacio Castro heard Abrina and Ana whispering&nbsp; to each other.&nbsp; However, B,&nbsp; Castro&nbsp; could not&nbsp; make&nbsp; out the conversation between the two as he was&nbsp; then busy at the wheel. Just&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Rizal&nbsp; Memorial Stadium&nbsp; on&nbsp; Dakota&nbsp; St.,&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; Magallanes&nbsp; told&nbsp; Castro&nbsp; to&nbsp; atop&nbsp; the&nbsp; vehicle.&nbsp; The vehicle having been brought to a&nbsp; stop, Magallanes paid&nbsp; the&nbsp; drive P0.30. Ano then dragged Vengco down&nbsp; at a spot in front of a public toilet before the&nbsp; Rizal&nbsp; Memorial Stadium going south on Dakota&nbsp; St. After the three accused had taken Vengco down, and before Bonifacio Castro resumed&nbsp; motion, the latter&nbsp; saw the accused Ano hit Vengco&nbsp; either on&nbsp; the face or&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; chest, while&nbsp; Abrina&nbsp; and Magallanes were behind Ano."<br><br>Witness Abelardo Lucero&nbsp; testified about the autopsy he performed on the body of the deceased and the stab wounds he found thereon, to wit:<br><blockquote>"Stab wound, base of the neck, right, piercing aorta, penetrating" anterior chest, (6 cm. X 2.5&nbsp; cm. x 14 cm.)<br>Stab wound, .neck, left, post-auricular cutting the cervical vertebra and spinal cord&nbsp; (8&nbsp; X 1-5 X 8.5&nbsp; cm.)<br>Stab wounds, multiple (4), left&nbsp; side of the neck, one measuring 2 x&nbsp; 2&nbsp; x&nbsp; 6&nbsp; cm.; another&nbsp; measuring&nbsp; 2.6 X 1&nbsp; X&nbsp; 3.5 cm.; another measuring 2.2 X 2.9&nbsp; x 3 cm.; and&nbsp; the last measuring 2.5 X 0-6 X&nbsp; 3 cm.<br>Stab wounds, multiple (3) nape of the neck; one measuring 1.5 cm. X 0.5 cm. X 1-8 cm.; another measuring 2.5 X 1 cm. X 3 cm. and the last&nbsp; measuring&nbsp; 3X1X4 cm.<br>Stab&nbsp; wound, scalp, over&nbsp; the occipital&nbsp; protuberance&nbsp; measuring 2.5 X 0.4&nbsp; cm. X 0.4 cm.&nbsp; deep.<br>Contused abrasions, multiple, scattered, right and left&nbsp; face, right shoulder,&nbsp; chin, both&nbsp; knees.<br>Shock and&nbsp; hemorrhage (850 cc.&nbsp; recovered blood)&nbsp; due&nbsp; to multiple (10)&nbsp; stab wounds in the neck."</blockquote></blockquote>He also testified that, on the whole, the wounds were mortal and, judging by&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature and&nbsp; location of&nbsp; the wounds, the assailants&nbsp; of&nbsp; Vengco must have been&nbsp; at the back or at the side of the victim.<br><br>David Martinez testified about the&nbsp; Parker fountain&nbsp; pen, diamond&nbsp; ring,&nbsp; rimless&nbsp; eyeglasses and&nbsp; watch which the deceased had with him when&nbsp; the latter and he&nbsp; (witness) separated at the corner of P. Paterno St. and Quezon Blvd., Quiapo,&nbsp; between 2:00 and 3:00 o'clock in the&nbsp; morning of July 4,&nbsp; 1953.<br><br>Irene&nbsp; Tayson mainly&nbsp; testified about&nbsp; these articles of Vengco&nbsp; which were missing from his dead body when it was found&nbsp; and searched by Lt.&nbsp; Dujua, Cpl.&nbsp; Villasin and other detectives on said date.<br><br>And Corporal Villasin mainly&nbsp; testified about the investigation&nbsp; he&nbsp; conducted,&nbsp; the arrest of the appellants, their identification by&nbsp; Bonifacio Castro and&nbsp; the&nbsp; taking&nbsp; and preparation of the affidavit of Lorenzo&nbsp; Magallanes (Exhibit E). If.<br><br>Appellants&nbsp; urge that the&nbsp; foregoing evidence for&nbsp; the prosecution is&nbsp; completely&nbsp; insufficient to establish&nbsp; their guilt for the crime charged against them; more especially, they claim that even granting the testimony of&nbsp; Bonifacio Castro&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; true,&nbsp; said testimony&nbsp; would not show that they were&nbsp; the ones&nbsp; who killed and&nbsp; robbed Vengco in&nbsp; the early morning of July 4, 1953. At most,&nbsp; they insist, there being no clear and&nbsp; positive evidence that they&nbsp; attacked, killed and&nbsp; robbed the deceased Vengco,&nbsp; and there being no proof of conspiracy,&nbsp; if at all&nbsp; the&nbsp; only one who could be held responsible for physical injuries&nbsp; is Norberto Ano who, according to Castro, pulled down the deceased Vengco from the jeepney and dealt him fist blows on the face or chest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, they&nbsp; set up alibi as&nbsp; their&nbsp; defense&nbsp; and, specifically, appellant Magallanes&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; that his affidavit (Exhibit E)&nbsp; was obtained&nbsp; from him thru&nbsp; torture and maltreatment&nbsp; by the police authorities.<br><br>Upon careful consideration of the foregoing contentions, we find&nbsp; them untenable for, while it is true that there was no eyewitness to the actual&nbsp; killing&nbsp; and robbery&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased Vengco, it is a fact that Castro saw&nbsp; appellant Ano&nbsp; succeed in pulling Vengco down from the jeepney and hit him&nbsp; on&nbsp; the face or chest in the presence of Magallanes and&nbsp; Abrina;&nbsp; which&nbsp; fact taken together with the other unrefuted fact that Vengco was found dead scarcely one or one and a half hours after he was pulled down from the jeepney&nbsp; and attacked by Ano, do constitute certainly a well-founded ground to&nbsp; pin the responsibility on the&nbsp; defendants for the crime at bar, because&nbsp; they were the last persons&nbsp; seen manhandling the deceased and, as pointed&nbsp; by the Solicitor General, it&nbsp; would be absurd to&nbsp; assume&nbsp; that their manhandling of the deceased was only&nbsp; to caress&nbsp; or scare the&nbsp; latter considering that the&nbsp; victim was found brutally&nbsp; killed with&nbsp; ten&nbsp; stab wounds&nbsp; quite&nbsp; immediately after he was manhandled.<br><br>Castro's testimony&nbsp; is,&nbsp; however, assailed as unreliable because&nbsp; of his failure to immediately report the&nbsp; incidents to the police authorities, but he explained&nbsp; that he failed to do&nbsp; so because he was shocked&nbsp; and&nbsp; terribly scared&nbsp; by what he saw on that occasion, and certainly this is a strong reason for&nbsp; him&nbsp; to&nbsp; shut his lips,&nbsp; he being&nbsp; an ordinary person, a jeepney driver who depended on his daily wages for his&nbsp; and his&nbsp; family's subsistence and who&nbsp; would&nbsp; not be willing to lose much time to testify at&nbsp; the trial of a case which does&nbsp; not concern him personally.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in failing to report the incident promptly, he might have been prompted' by fear&nbsp; of reprisal by&nbsp; the defendants,&nbsp; which, ordinarily, is a strong factor for common people to fail to immediately denounce the perpetrators of a&nbsp; crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the lower court committed no error in giving full credence to Castro's testimony for, as correctly stated in the decision,<br><blockquote>"There was no showing&nbsp; of any improper motive or purpose on the part&nbsp; of Bonifacio&nbsp; Castro in&nbsp; imputing to these three&nbsp; accused so serious a crime&nbsp; as that&nbsp; alleged in the information.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; absence, therefore, of any improper purpose "which may have activated Bonifacio Castro&nbsp; in testifying&nbsp; against them, his&nbsp; testimony should be entitled to&nbsp; full credence.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People vs. De los Reyes, 82 Phil.,&nbsp; 180 46 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [No. 41] p. 1520;&nbsp; People vs.&nbsp; Dizon,&nbsp; 78 Phil., 265, 42 Off. Gaz., [No.&nbsp; 11],&nbsp; p. 2766,&nbsp; People vs.&nbsp; Gonzales, 42 Off. Gaz., [No.&nbsp; 12], p. 3195;&nbsp; 78 Phil., 473).<br><br>The&nbsp; fact that, for about 3&nbsp; weeks after&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime, Bonifacio Castro did not reveal&nbsp; the crime to the authorities does not detract from his&nbsp; credibility, his silence having been explained by him&nbsp; that he was too scared to report.&nbsp;&nbsp; (People vs. Malibiran,&nbsp; G.&nbsp; E.&nbsp; No. L-4192, December&nbsp; 27, 1951).&nbsp; Then, too,&nbsp; we must consider that coupled with that is the well known&nbsp; inclination of the common run of people to keep aloof of matters that do&nbsp; not concern them personally,&nbsp; specially&nbsp; matters that&nbsp; might take them away from their usual occupation.&nbsp; (People vs.&nbsp; Gutierrez,&nbsp; 88&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 592.)"</blockquote>Appellants also urge&nbsp; that, there being no evidence of conspiracy among them, they cannot be held liable, as the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; did,&nbsp; for the offense&nbsp; charged&nbsp; against&nbsp; them. It has, however,&nbsp; been established beyond reasonable doubt that&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; they boarded the&nbsp; jeepney at the&nbsp; same time; (2)&nbsp; Abrina&nbsp; and&nbsp; Ano&nbsp; were&nbsp; seen and heard whispering to each&nbsp; other while the&nbsp; jeepney was in motion;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Magallanes ordered the driver to stop, and as the latter stopped the vehicle, he&nbsp; paid&nbsp; 30¢&nbsp; as fare, that is 10$ for each of the three&nbsp; appellants;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Ano&nbsp; dragged&nbsp; the deceased out of&nbsp; the jeepney while&nbsp; Abrina&nbsp; and Magallanes waited and&nbsp; in&nbsp; fact stood behind the deceased when the later was socked&nbsp; by Ano;&nbsp; all of which clearly show the appellants' sharing of&nbsp; criminal purpose&nbsp; and&nbsp; strongly indicate&nbsp; conspiracy, for which reason they&nbsp; should be held&nbsp; liable for the crime at&nbsp; bar despite&nbsp; the absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; clear&nbsp; and distinct evidence who among&nbsp; them inflict the stab wounds&nbsp; upon the deceased and who among them took away his personal belongings,&nbsp; for&nbsp; conspiracy, once established,&nbsp; makes each and&nbsp; everyone of the appellants liable for the crime committed&nbsp; by anyone&nbsp; of&nbsp; them.<br><br>Anent the respective defenses offerred&nbsp; by the appellants at the&nbsp; trial of the case, which are&nbsp; now&nbsp; insisted&nbsp; upon in this&nbsp; instance, we find correct&nbsp; and&nbsp; well&nbsp; founded the trial court's&nbsp; ruling thereon and see no justification for disturbing its findings which we quote:<br><blockquote>"The accused Abrina brushed aside the charge against him with a shrug&nbsp; of the shoulders and as I do not know anything about that' (Wala akong alam dian).&nbsp; On cross-examination by the fiscal, he admitted that ho had been convicted&nbsp; of robbery on February 16, 19A8 in criminal&nbsp; case No. 1414 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and for which he&nbsp; had served an&nbsp; indeterminate sentence of&nbsp; from two years, to six years and one day.&nbsp; He was released on November 11, 1947&nbsp; (See also Exhibit&nbsp; F).&nbsp; It is of course obvious that this defendant's&nbsp; bare denial cannot prevail over Bonifacio Castro's positive testimony.&nbsp; (People va. Ferrer, 44 Off. Gaz. [No.&nbsp; 1], p. 1123; Aribas [CA], 46 Off. Gaz. [No, 5],&nbsp; 2049).<br><br>"The accused Lorenzo&nbsp; Magallanes set&nbsp; up some sort of an&nbsp; alibi. He testified that he could not remember&nbsp; exactly where&nbsp; he was&nbsp; in the night of July&nbsp; 3, 1953, except that lie was&nbsp; at Pasay City.&nbsp; He also denied having been with his co-accusod Ano and Abrina in the night&nbsp; of July 3, 1953.&nbsp; He further stated that he could&nbsp; not remember where he had been after July 3, 1953.&nbsp; He admitted, however, having been&nbsp; arrested&nbsp; either on August 5, 1953, or August 6,&nbsp; 1953.<br><br>"This&nbsp; accused attempted to&nbsp; repudiate&nbsp; his confession. Exhibit E, by alleging torture and&nbsp; maltreatment in the&nbsp; hands of the&nbsp; police authorities.&nbsp; He claimed that lie came to know&nbsp; his co-accused&nbsp; Norberto&nbsp; Ano and Manuel Abrina only in&nbsp; the City Jail during&nbsp; their detention, altho he&nbsp; said&nbsp; he knew Abrina by face because&nbsp; he had seen him&nbsp; gambling&nbsp; on Leveriza.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; apparent,&nbsp; however, that his attempted repudiation of his&nbsp; statement&nbsp; is Exhibit 'E'&nbsp; must be over-ruled.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first&nbsp; place, the statement is replete with details that could have been known only to him but which were difficult&nbsp; or even impossible&nbsp; for the&nbsp; police to&nbsp; insert&nbsp; or&nbsp; include&nbsp; therein&nbsp; (People vs. Pulido,&nbsp; et al., 47 Off. Gaz. [No. 9],&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 4581).&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; second&nbsp; place, his allegation&nbsp; of&nbsp; torture and maltreatment&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; hands&nbsp; of&nbsp; the police is belied by the fact that the latter did not obtain any written confession from his co-accused Abrina and Ano.<br><br>"The&nbsp; defense of the accused Norberfco Ano, a former dock&nbsp; laborer who has been out of work for at least one year prior to July, 1953, is planted&nbsp; on an alibi consisting1 in&nbsp; his&nbsp; own testimony&nbsp; and&nbsp; that of his sister, Remedios Ano, and bis townmate, Laureana&nbsp; Regalado,&nbsp; a medical student of the University of Santo Tomas.&nbsp; The gist of his alibi is that he was at home at 58&nbsp; Valenzuela St. the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; night of July 8, 1953, because lie&nbsp; was suffering' from&nbsp; fever&nbsp; due&nbsp; to pulmonary tuberculosis.<br><br>"According to this defendant's&nbsp; testimonial evidence,&nbsp; he went to the Philippine Anti&nbsp; Tuberculosis Society at 1893 Rizal Ave.,&nbsp; Manila, for consultation on&nbsp; June 30,&nbsp; 1953 and&nbsp; was issued a patient's identification&nbsp; card as Case No. 20900 (Exhibit 3) ;&nbsp; that&nbsp; lie was&nbsp; given prescriptions for dehydo-streptomydn, tenitone and by draeid tablets, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding instruction for their&nbsp; use&nbsp; (Exhibits 4, 5, 6 ;and 7); that he and his sister, Remedios Ano, purchased&nbsp; the medicines from tho&nbsp; Globe Drag Store in&nbsp; Quiapo at around 9&nbsp; o'clock in the morning'&nbsp; of&nbsp; July 3,&nbsp; 1953;&nbsp; that&nbsp; around 7&nbsp; or 8&nbsp; o'clock in the evening of&nbsp; July 3,&nbsp; 1953, Miss Regalado&nbsp; started&nbsp; treating&nbsp; him&nbsp; by giving him the first injection of streptomycin; that he did not leave the house the whole night of July 3, 1953 as he was&nbsp; suffering from fever and&nbsp; pains on the chest; that&nbsp; Miss Regalado checked&nbsp; him&nbsp; up every two hours between 10 o'clock p. m, of July S, 1953 to 4 o'clock a.m.&nbsp; of July&nbsp; 4, 1958.<br><br>"On cross&nbsp; examination (Miss Regalado&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that she is a townmate of&nbsp; the accused and his sister; that she has&nbsp; been boarding with&nbsp; Remedios&nbsp; at&nbsp;&nbsp; 58 Valenzuela St.,&nbsp; Manila, and, at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of her&nbsp; testimony, was still boarding with her at&nbsp; 72-B&nbsp; Lima Street, Project No.&nbsp; 4, Quezon City.<br><br>"After&nbsp; an evaluation of the evidence in&nbsp; support of the alibi&nbsp; set up by the accused&nbsp; Norberto&nbsp; Ano, the Court believes&nbsp; that the same must be overruled.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; first place, it would&nbsp; appear from&nbsp; his testimony&nbsp; and that of his sister, Remedios, that&nbsp; although&nbsp; he may have been suffering of pulmonary tuberculosis in July 1953, he was :at most an&nbsp; ambulatory patient as shown by the fact&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was able to&nbsp; go to the Philippine Anti Tuberculosis Clinic on Rizal Avenue on June 30,&nbsp; 1953 for consultation, and that lie even went with&nbsp; his sister in purchasing' the medicine's allegedly prescribed for Mm from the Globe&nbsp; Drug Store on the morning of July 3, 1953.&nbsp; This is, of course, in the assumption&nbsp; that&nbsp; his sister Remedios had&nbsp; already purchased the medicine prescribed in Exhibit 4, 5, 6 and ", for if she had really&nbsp; done go, the&nbsp; prescriptions Exhibits 4, 5 and 7 would nave been retained by the pharmacist in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; second place, the testimonial evidence in&nbsp; support of his&nbsp; alibi&nbsp; comes from his own sister and&nbsp; his townmate. Because of the easiness with which testimonial evidence in support of the&nbsp; alibi can be manufactured&nbsp; among members of a family and&nbsp; among friends&nbsp; and&nbsp; even&nbsp; among those&nbsp; who are not (People vs.&nbsp; Nolasco,&nbsp; 88&nbsp; Phil., 676), the court&nbsp; believes that the testimonial evidence&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; in support of Ano's alibi&nbsp; cannot prevail over&nbsp; his positive&nbsp; identification by the government witness, Bonifacio Castro, and the latter's clear and convincing testimony."</blockquote>The facts of the&nbsp; case, as&nbsp; sufficiently and&nbsp; clearly established by the evidence on&nbsp; record, constitute the crime&nbsp; of robbery with homicide with the aggravating&nbsp; circumstances of nocturnity&nbsp; and abuse&nbsp; of superior strength and the further aggravating circumstances of recidivism as to Manuel Abrina y Montano and therefore, the trial court justifiably imposed upon the appellants&nbsp; the supreme penalty of death. However, as&nbsp; the votes of the members of this Court fell short&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; required number for the&nbsp; imposition&nbsp; of said penalty, the&nbsp; same&nbsp; should be as it is hereby reduced,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; law,&nbsp; to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; hereby modified&nbsp; as above&nbsp; indicated and affirmed in&nbsp; all other respects, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Cvneepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B. L.,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Felix,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
