				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellants Benito Liwanag and Maria Liwanag Reyes are co-owners of Liwanag Auto Supply, a commercial establishment&nbsp; located&nbsp; at 349 Dimasalang,&nbsp; Sampaloc,&nbsp; Manila. They employed Roque Balderama as security guard who, while&nbsp; in line of duty, was&nbsp; killed by criminal hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; His widow Ciriaca vda. de&nbsp; Balderama and minor children Genara, Carlos and Leogardo,&nbsp; all surnamed Balderama, in due time filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; claim for&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; with the Workmen's Compensation Commission,&nbsp; which was granted in an award worded as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE,&nbsp; the order of the referee under consideration should be,&nbsp; as&nbsp; it&nbsp; is hereby, affirmed and respondents Benito Liwanag and Maria Liwanag Reyes, ordered:<br><br>"1. To pay jointly and severally the amount of Three Thousand Four&nbsp; Hundred Ninety-four and&nbsp; 40/100&nbsp; (P3,494.40)&nbsp; Pesos&nbsp; to the claimants in lump sum; and<br><br>"To pay to the Workmen's Compensation Funds the sum of P4.00 (including P5.00 for&nbsp; this&nbsp; review) as fees, pursuant to Section 55 of the&nbsp; Act."<br></blockquote>In appealing the&nbsp; case to&nbsp; this&nbsp; Tribunal,&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; do not question the right of appellees to compensation nor the amount awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; They only claim that, under the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Act, the compensation&nbsp; is&nbsp; divisible, hence the Commission erred in ordering appellants to pay jointly&nbsp; and severally the&nbsp; amount awarded.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; argue that there is nothing in the compensation Act which provides that the obligation of an employer arising from compensable&nbsp; injury or death of an&nbsp; employee&nbsp; should be solidary ; that if the&nbsp; legislative intent in enacting the law is to impose solidary obligation, the&nbsp; same&nbsp; should have been specifically provided, and that, in the absence of such clear provision, the&nbsp; responsibility of appellants should&nbsp; not be solidary but merely joint.<br><br>At first blush,&nbsp; appellants' contention would&nbsp; seem to be well taken,&nbsp; for, ordinarily, the liability of the partners in a partnership&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; solidary;&nbsp; but the law governing the liability of partners is not applicable to the case at bar wherein a claim&nbsp; for compensation by&nbsp; dependents&nbsp; of an employee who&nbsp; died in line of&nbsp; duty is involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; And although&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Act does not contain any&nbsp; provision&nbsp; expressly declaring solidary obligation of business partners like the&nbsp; herein appellants, there&nbsp; are other provisions of law&nbsp; from&nbsp; which it could&nbsp; be&nbsp; gathered that their liability must be solidary.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arts.&nbsp; 1711 and 1712 of the new Civil Code provide:<br><blockquote>"ART. 1711. Owners of enterprises and other&nbsp; employers are obliged to pay compensation for the&nbsp; death of or injuries to their laborers, workmen, mechanics&nbsp; or other&nbsp; employees, even though&nbsp; the&nbsp; event may&nbsp; have&nbsp; been purely&nbsp; accidental or&nbsp; entirely&nbsp; due to a fortuitous cause, if the death&nbsp; or personal injury arose out&nbsp; of and&nbsp; in the course of the employment. *&nbsp; * *."<br><br>"Art.&nbsp; 1712. If the death or injury is due to the negligence of a fellow-worker, the latter and&nbsp; the employer shall be solidarity liable for compensation. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote>And&nbsp; Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, reads in part as follows:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *. The right to compensation as provided in this Act shall not&nbsp; be defeated or impaired&nbsp; on the ground that the death, injury or disease was due to the negligence of a fellow servant or employee, without prejudice to&nbsp; the right of the employer to proceed against the negligent party."<br></blockquote>The provisions&nbsp; of the new&nbsp; Civil Code above quoted taken together with&nbsp; those of Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, reasonably indicate that&nbsp; in compensation cases, the liability of business partners, like appellants, should be solidary; otherwise, the right of&nbsp; the employee may be&nbsp; defeated,&nbsp; or at least crippled.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the responsibility of appellants were to be merely joint and not solidary, and one&nbsp; of them happens to be&nbsp; insolvent, the amount awarded to the appellees would&nbsp; only be partially satisfied, which is&nbsp; evidently contrary to the intent and&nbsp; purposes of the Act.&nbsp; In previous cases we have already held that the Workmen's Compensation Act should be construed fairly, reasonably and liberally in favor of and for the benefit of the employee&nbsp; and his dependents; that&nbsp; all doubts as to right of&nbsp; compensation resolved&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; favor;&nbsp; and that it should be interpreted to promote its purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the present controversy should be decided in favor of the appellees.<br><br>Moreover, Art. 1207 of the new Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; There is <i>solidary liability</i> only when the obligation expressly so&nbsp; states, or&nbsp; when the law or <i>the nature of&nbsp; the obligation requires</i> solidarity."<br></blockquote>Since&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Act&nbsp; was enacted to give full&nbsp; protection to the employee, reason&nbsp; demands that the nature of the&nbsp; obligation of the employers&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; compensation to the heirs of their employee who&nbsp; died in line of duty, should be solidary; otherwise, the purpose of the law could not&nbsp; be attained.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; finding no&nbsp; error in the award appealed from,&nbsp; the same is hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against appellants.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador</i>, and <i>Concepcion, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><center>DISSENTING</center><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">REYES, A., J. :</span><br><br>Whether the defendants herein be&nbsp; regarded as co-partners or as mere co-owners, their liability for the indemnity due their deceased employee would not be solidary but only <i>pro rata</i>&nbsp; (Arts.&nbsp; 485&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1815,&nbsp; new Civil Code).&nbsp; The Workmen's Compensation Act does&nbsp; not change the nature of that liability&nbsp; either&nbsp; expressly or&nbsp; by&nbsp; intendment.&nbsp; To hold that it does, is to read into the Act something that is not there.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this Court, therefore,&nbsp; to declare that under the said Act&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants herein are liable solidarily is to play the role of legislator.<br><br>The injustice of&nbsp; the rule&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to be&nbsp; established&nbsp; in the majority opinion&nbsp; may&nbsp; readily be made obvious with an example.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose that one of two co-partners&nbsp; or co-owners&nbsp; owns 99&nbsp; percent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the business&nbsp; while his co-partner or co-owner owns only 1 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp; To hold that in such case&nbsp; the latter's&nbsp; liability may&nbsp; run up to 100 percent although his&nbsp; interest is only 1 per cent would not only be illogical but also&nbsp; inequitable.<br><br>For the&nbsp; foregoing reasons, I have no choice but to dissent.</div>
