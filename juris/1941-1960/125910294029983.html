				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is a petition to review, on certiorari the decision of the Court of Appeals  (in CA-G. R. No. 11129-R) affirming the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila (in Civil Case No. 16308), awarding to respondent Jose Bautista (as guardian ad Utem of the minor  Narcisa Bautista) the amounts of P1,075.00 as actual or compensatory damages, and P1,500.00 as moral damages, with costs.</p>
<p>It appears that at about 4:00 o'clock in the morning of February 13, 1952, Narcisa  Bautista,  a minor then about 6 years of  age, her  aunt Pelagia Bautista,  a sister, and two boys and another girl, boarded at Taft Avenue, Manila in the neighborhood of their home at  1183 Int., Agno St., Malate, a taxicab bearing Plate No.  1401, belonging to petitioner Rex Taxicab  Co., Inc.,  driven  by its driver, Mario Miranda.  Said taxicab  was a Ford,  1947 model,  Sedan type, and had been used by petitioner in its business continuously for the preceding 5 years.  Narcisa seated herself at the back seat near the left  rear door,  and next to her in the center was her aunt  Pelagia.   As soon as all said passengers were seated in the taxicab, Pelagia told its driver to take them to the Tutuban Railroad  Station, where they intended to board a train bound  for San Carlos, Pangasinan. While  the taxicab was running northward along the east lane of Taft Avenue in front of the City Hall,  Narcisa felt the necessity to spit.   She  asked permission from her aunt, and the latter having consented, she stood up, placed her arms, which were crossed, on the sill of the window of the left rear door of the taxicab and leaned thereon to spit. All of  a sudden, said  door opened, and Narcisa fell on the pavement outside.   She was immediately taken to the Phillippine General Hospital and, upon medical examination, it was found that she  sustained fractures of several bones in the head, particularly, in the parrieto-occipital region, and several wounds and bruises in other parts of her body.  She was  admitted in said hospital  on  the same day,  and was discharged therefrom on  February 18,  1952.   She, however, continued to receive medical attendance thereafter. For her hospitalization, doctor's bills, medicine, and other incidental expenses, her parents spent the sum of P790.00.</p>
<p>Petitioner Rex Taxicab  Co., in this instance, claims that the driver of the taxicab in question was not guilty of negligence, and that the fall of the girl was due to pure accident  if not to her own act of leaning against the door thereby accidentally  touching  the  lever which  caused its opening. The Court of Appeals, however, rejected this theory and expressly accepted the finding of the lower court that the driver was negligent.  This is a factual finding binding on this Court and which we are not authorized to  review.</p>
<p>Petitioner next contends that the Court of Appeals erred in awarding moral damages to respondent Bautista.</p>
<p>The contention is meritorious.  This Court has repeatedly held  (Caehero  vs.  Manila  Yellow Taxicab,  Ind., 101 Phil., 523; 54 Off. Gaz. [26] 6599; Necesito vs. Paras, et al., 104  Phil., 75; 56 Off.  Gaz. [23] 4023; Fores vs. Miranda, 105 Phil., 266; 57 Off. Gaz. [44] 7938; Tamayo vs. Aguino, et al., 105 Phil., 949;  56 Off. Gaz. [36] 5617)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that moral damages are not recoverable in damage action, predicated on a breach of the contract of transportation, as  in the instant case, in view of the provisions of Articles 2219 and 2220 of the new Civil Code.  The exceptions-according to the Fores case, <em>supra</em> (which we here re-affirm), are (1) where the mishap results in the death of a passenger, and (2) where it is proved that the carrier was guilty of fraud or had faith, even if death does not result.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The exception to the basic rule of damages now under consideration is a mishap resulting in the death of a passenger, in which case Article 1764  makes  the  common carrier expressly subject to  the rule of Art. 2200, that entitles the spouse, descendants and ascendants of the deceased  passenger to 'demand  moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death of the deceased' (Necesito vs. Paras, 104 Phil., 75; 56 Off. Gaz. [23J 4023, Resolution on motion to reconsider,  September 11, 1958).  But the exceptional rule of Art. 1765 makes it all the more evident that where the injured passenger does not die, moral damages are  not recoverable unless it is proved that carrier was guilty of malice or bad faith.   We think it is clear that the mere carelessness of the carrier's driver does not <em>per se</em> constitute or  justify an inference of malice or bad faith on the part of the carrier; and in the case at bar there is no other evidence of such malice to support  the  award  of moral damages by the  Court of Appeals.   To award moral damages  for breach of  contract, therefore,  without  proof  of bad faith or  malice on the part  of the defendant as required by Art. 2220, would be to violate  the clear provisions of the law,  and constitute unwarranted  judicial legislation."  (Fores vs.  Miranda, <em>supra</em>.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  does not appear in the case before us that the victim of  the mishap, Narcisa Bautista, died as a result  thereof. Neither has  it been  shown that petitioner has acted with malice or "bad faith  in connection  with  said mishap.  The mere carelessness of  its driver,  according  to  the <em>Fores</em> case, <em>supra</em>, "does not <em>per se</em> constitute or justify an inference of malice or bad faith" on its  part.   Consequently, the award of the moral  damages in  question in the amount of P1 ,500.00 to  respondent was improper.</p>
<p>Petitioner  lastly argues that the Court of Appeals erred in  awarding attorney's fees to respondent Bautista.  It is urged that since  the instant case does not come Mnderany of the instances mentioned in Article 2208 of the new Civil Code wherein attorney's fees are recoverable, the award of attorney's fees in question to respondent was improper.</p>
<p>Pertinent portion of the decision of the Court of Appeals, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The amount awarded  for. compensatory damages evidently included all the compensatory damages, including  attorney's fees, to which the trial court believed  the  apppellee is entitled, for the disbursements made by Jose Bautista father of the appellee/ for the injuries suffered by the latter only amounted to P790.00 * * *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this, it seems that the Court of Appeals, after finding that the actual or compensatory damages to which respondent Bautista was entitled are only P790.00, it being the total disbursements made by him in connection with the injuries suffered by the minor Narcisa Bautista, considered the difference between the sum of Pl,075.00 awarded the Court of First Instance and P790.00, or P285.00 as attorney's fees, to which, respondent is justly and equitably entitled (Article 2208  [11], new Civil Code).  Under the circumstances of the case, we are not prepared to declare that the Court of Appeals erred in this  regard.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is modified, by eliminating therein the sum of Pl,500.00 as moral damages awarded by the Court of Appeals to respondent Bautista., Said decision is, iivall other respects, affirmed without pronouncement as to costs.   So ordered.</p>
