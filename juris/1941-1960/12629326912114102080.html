				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A complaint for multiple murder, frustrated murder, and attempted murder was filed against the accused before the Justice&nbsp; of the Peace court of&nbsp; Roxas, Palawan.&nbsp; Having waived&nbsp; his&nbsp; right to&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation,&nbsp; the case was forwarded to the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of the province where the&nbsp; Fiscal filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; information for the same crime against him of the following&nbsp; tenor:<br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; on or about the 11th day of October, 1956,&nbsp; in the municipality of Roxas, province of Palawan,&nbsp; Philippines and within&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Honorable Court, the&nbsp; said accused, with&nbsp; deliberate&nbsp; intent, evident premeditation, treachery and with the&nbsp; use of deadly weapon, to wit: a spear and big&nbsp; bolo, did then and there wilfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and&nbsp; feloniously attack, assault and wound&nbsp; one after&nbsp; another, in one&nbsp; continuous&nbsp; act&nbsp; and in&nbsp; and around their dwelling&nbsp; houses, the following persons,&nbsp; namely:&nbsp; Maxima Pacho, 37 years&nbsp; old and Romana&nbsp; Pacho, 34 years old, both pregnant; Fortunato Nares, Jr.,&nbsp; 5&nbsp; years old;&nbsp; Aurelia&nbsp; Paz,&nbsp; 7 years&nbsp; old; Lilia Paz, 5'years&nbsp; old; Herminia Paz, 6 months old; Nenita Sausa,&nbsp; 5 years&nbsp; old; and Henry Pacaldo, 5 years old, all minors; and Pelomina Baaco, 48 years old; Salome Baaco,&nbsp; 23&nbsp; years old; Baudelio Pacho, 18 years&nbsp; old; Leonila Llavan, 25 years old;&nbsp; Urbana Abique, 50 years old; Felisa&nbsp; Adion,&nbsp; 37 years old; Lolita Yayen, 17&nbsp; years&nbsp; old and Manuela&nbsp; Llavan, 39 years old, and&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result&nbsp; thereof, the&nbsp; said victims&nbsp; died instantly;&nbsp; and, in furtherance, of&nbsp; his criminal and heinous act, did&nbsp; then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and wound one Manuel Adion with the same spear, who, as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result&nbsp; thereof, suffered&nbsp; a spear wound&nbsp; at&nbsp; the back, hitting the&nbsp; left&nbsp; lower lobe of the&nbsp; lung,&nbsp; which ordinarily would cause&nbsp; the death of&nbsp; said&nbsp; Manuel Adion, thus&nbsp; performing all&nbsp; the acts of execution which should have&nbsp; produced the crime of Murder asa consequence, but nevertheless, did not produce it by reason of causes of independent of his will, that&nbsp; is,&nbsp; by the timely and&nbsp; able medical attendance rendered to said Manuel Adion which prevented his death;&nbsp; and,&nbsp; finally,&nbsp; not satisfied with&nbsp; his heinous acts and to show further his criminal propensity, did&nbsp; then and&nbsp; there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with deliberate&nbsp; intent to&nbsp; kill&nbsp; Pablo Paz and Severino Adion, try and attempt to thrust his spear against said Pablo Paz and Severino Adion, by overt acts, but fortunately missed the said&nbsp; Pablo Paz and Severino Adion.<br><br>"With&nbsp; the aggravating circumstances of evident&nbsp; premeditation, taking advantage of superior strength, <span style="font-style: italic;">alevosia</span>, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime was committed in the dwelling of the&nbsp; victims and that the wrong done in the&nbsp; commission of the&nbsp; crime was&nbsp; deliberately augmented by causing other wrong not&nbsp; necessary for&nbsp; its&nbsp; commission."&nbsp; (pp. 2-3, appellee's brief).<br></blockquote>On October 24,&nbsp; 1956, a physical and mental examination of the accused was conducted&nbsp; by the Chief of the Puerto Princesa Hospital and he was found to be normal and sane.&nbsp; He even narrated how he killed his common-law wife and&nbsp; his other victims.&nbsp; Two local lawyers&nbsp; were appointed counsel <i>de oficio</i> to defend him.&nbsp; Upon arraignment, interpreted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the local dialect, he pleaded guilty. This notwithstanding, considering&nbsp; the gravity of the offenses&nbsp; charged,&nbsp; the Court asked him to take&nbsp; the witness stand and narrate the&nbsp; circumstances surrounding&nbsp; their commission, but he refused&nbsp; stating&nbsp; that he had already made a confession.&nbsp; Thereupon, the Court asked the prosecution to&nbsp; present&nbsp; its evidence,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the Fiscal presented among his&nbsp; exhibits the murder weapon, the confession of the&nbsp; accused, the sketches of&nbsp; the scene of the crime, the sixteen certificates&nbsp; of death,&nbsp; the affidavits of some&nbsp; witnesses, and the ante mortem&nbsp; declaration of Manuel Adion.<br><br>The Provincial Commander of Puerto Princesa who investigated&nbsp; the accused testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; propounded the questions to him in Tagalog, which is the dialect known to him, while Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Oscar Siat, before whom the confession&nbsp; was&nbsp; subscribed and&nbsp; sworn to, testified&nbsp; that he read the document and translated&nbsp; it into Tagalog for the benefit&nbsp; of the accused, and when&nbsp; he asked him if he was coerced into making the&nbsp; statement, he acknowledged that it was voluntarily given by him.&nbsp; His statement is embodied in Exhibit "C".<br><br>After hearing, the&nbsp;&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered decision&nbsp; the dispositive&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; which reads:<br><br>IN&nbsp; VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the&nbsp; Court renders judgment finding DOMINGO SALAZAR alias DARQUEZ,&nbsp; guilty of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of Multiple Murder with Frustrated Murder as charged, and sentences him to suffer the penalty, as provided for in the Revised Penal Code, of sixteen (16) death penalties corresponding to the murder of each of the sixteen (16) victims, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P3,000.00 each; also to suffer the penalty for the crime of frustrated Murder of imprisonment the minimum of which shall not be less than EIGHT (8) years and one (1) DAY of <i>prision mayor</i> and the maximum of which shall not be less than&nbsp; seventeen (17) years, FOUR (4) months and one&nbsp; (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> for the two crimes of Attempted Murder to suffer imprisonment for each crime, the minimum of which shall not be less than TWO (2) years, FOUR (4) months and one (1) day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>and the maximum of which shall not be more than eight (8) years and ONE (1) day of <i>prision mayor </i>and to pay the costs.:" (pp. 10-11, appellee's brief).<br><br>The case&nbsp; was elevated to this Court for review.<br><br>The accused is a moro native of Zamboanga.&nbsp; For many years before the occurrence&nbsp; of the tragedy, he&nbsp; went&nbsp; to barrio San Nicolas, Roxas, Palawan, where he established his&nbsp; home&nbsp; with his&nbsp; common-law wife Maxima&nbsp; Pacho.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning of&nbsp; October&nbsp; 11, 1956, he&nbsp; invited his wife to go with him to gather&nbsp; nipa for the repair of their house. Romana then arrived and invited Maxima&nbsp; to&nbsp; accompany her to her house to get pajay.&nbsp; Because of the invitation of Romana,&nbsp; Maxima refused to go&nbsp; with&nbsp; her husband, which aroused his&nbsp; anger.&nbsp; At that time,&nbsp; the accused already entertained the suspicion that his wife was having illicit relation with&nbsp; Fortunato Nares, husband of Romana, to the extent that he believed that the&nbsp; child his wife was bearing&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; result of such illicit&nbsp; relation.&nbsp; This incident started the accused on a killing rampage leaving in its wake sixteen dead&nbsp; and some wounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is what happened&nbsp; as related by&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court: '"He started by killing his own sister-in-law.&nbsp; Then he turned to kill his own&nbsp; wife and his&nbsp; nephew. He then&nbsp; walked for about 800 meters to&nbsp; another house where he killed and massacred all the inmates he found therein.&nbsp; He&nbsp; went to three other&nbsp; houses&nbsp; and repeated the&nbsp; same performance leaving behind him several household filled&nbsp; with tragedy and bloody deaths, the like of which have never been seen or known in this province.&nbsp; Then he went into the school premises of that sitio and attacked one man from behind who was able to run away and is the lone survivor&nbsp; of this bloody incident.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that he chased and actually did throw his spear to two other men but whom he did not hit.&nbsp; And then he went to the&nbsp; school house and tried to force&nbsp; open the door, also with dark criminal intention. Fortunately due&nbsp; to the presence of mind of the lady teacher the door&nbsp; and windows were locked and barricaded while the accused went around trying to force open the entrance and the&nbsp; windows&nbsp; of the&nbsp; school house.&nbsp; The imagination&nbsp; of this Court shudders of the thought of what might have happened if this accused succeeded in going into the school room filled with young school children.&nbsp; And the accused went up&nbsp; to the bell tower of the Chapel, sounded the alarm calling for everybody to come.&nbsp; He&nbsp; asked that he be killed but&nbsp; no one dared to come and obey his request.&nbsp; Finally, when two armed guards arrived accompanied by a barrio officer, the accused was&nbsp; persuaded to surrender but&nbsp; on condition that he&nbsp; be&nbsp; shot and killed&nbsp; immediately.&nbsp; The guards and barrio&nbsp; officer cleverly made a ruse by asking the accused to go with them to the wharf where he will&nbsp; be shot, and by asking him to sign a piece of paper to serve as their&nbsp; protection for killing the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; which would be presented to the authorities later on.&nbsp; The accused&nbsp; in the meantime had put down his arms and as he was about to affix his thumbmark on the piece of paper he was suddenly grabbed and was subdued and put under custody."<br><br>Let us now come to the arguments advanced by counsel for the accused in an effort to mitigate his liability.&nbsp; These arguments in a nutshell may be boiled down into three,&nbsp; to wit:<br><ol><li>That&nbsp; the accused's plea of guilty did&nbsp; not extend&nbsp; to the&nbsp; admission of the correctness&nbsp; of the qualification&nbsp; of his acts as expressed by the prosecution in its information, particularly the allegation that the acts of the accused were committed with&nbsp; evident premeditation and with treachery,<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; running&nbsp; amuck, or becoming&nbsp; a&nbsp; "juramentado" is a cult&nbsp; among the&nbsp; Moros that forms part of their religion. It is age-old and deeply rooted&nbsp; in their psychology.&nbsp; The Moros do not discourage its observance.&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not view the observance of this cult as a heinous crime."&nbsp; The calculated risk they take when a Moro becomes "juramentado" is taken graciously.&nbsp; They are always alert to kill a "juramentado" before his victims multiply.&nbsp; And<br><br></li><li>Consequently, because the acts committed by the accused were parts and parcel of his observance of the Moro cult of being a "juramentado", which should be&nbsp; distinguished from the acts of a common murderer under our laws, counsel believes that the accused should only be considered as having committed the crimes of homicide, frustrated homicide,&nbsp; and attempted homicide,&nbsp; or&nbsp; something lesser than murder.<br></li></ol>There is&nbsp; no merit in the&nbsp; first argument.&nbsp; It should be noted that, in spite of the plea of guilty entered by the accused, the Court asked him to take the witness stand and narrate the circumstances surrounding the commission of the acts imputed to him, but he refused stating that he had already made a confession.&nbsp; When he was arraigned, he was assisted by two lawyers who where appointed by the Court to defend him.&nbsp; And when the information was read to him, its contents were interpreted into a dialect known to him, and when asked about his answer, his plea was of guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he did not understand the clear import of what is embodied in the&nbsp; information, or of what&nbsp; was stated in his written confession, he could have so explained when called by the trial court to take the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; stand. His refusal to do so gives rise to&nbsp; no other implication than that he was well aware&nbsp; of the seriousness of the&nbsp; occasion and of the import of the proceedings against him.&nbsp; He cannot, therefore,&nbsp; complain of&nbsp; the consequences.<br><br>A plea of guilty is an admission of all the material facts alleged in the information (U.S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Burlado, 42 Phil., 72; People <i>vs.</i> Acosta, 98&nbsp; Phil., 642; 52 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 1930-1933, March 23, 1956).&nbsp; A&nbsp; plea of guilty when formally entered on arraignment is&nbsp; sufficient to&nbsp; sustain&nbsp; conviction of the offense&nbsp; charged without the&nbsp; introduction of further evidence, upon the theory that the defendant himself has supplied the&nbsp; necessary proof by&nbsp; his plea of guilty (U.S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Jawad,&nbsp; 37 Phil., 305).&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case, despite&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused's&nbsp; plea&nbsp; of guilty,&nbsp; the prosecution&nbsp; offered evidence considering the peculiar circumstances&nbsp; surrounding the commission of the acts&nbsp; charged.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the&nbsp; evidence presented substantially supports the&nbsp; material&nbsp; allegations of the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, by his&nbsp; plea, the accused is deemed to have admitted&nbsp; not only the commission of the&nbsp; offenses&nbsp; charged, but the circumstances surrounding their commission, such&nbsp; as&nbsp; evident premeditation, taking advantage of superior strength, <i>alevosia</i>, and dwelling.<br><br>The mitigating circumstance of obfuscation arising from jealously&nbsp; cannot be invoked in favor of&nbsp; the accused considering that his&nbsp; relationship with his common-law wife was&nbsp; illegitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.S. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Hicks, 14&nbsp; Phil., 217; People <i>vs.</i> Olgado, et al., G. R. No.&nbsp; L-4406, March 31, 1952).&nbsp; In addition, many days had already passed from&nbsp; the discovery of the alleged infidelity of his common-law wife before he committed the crime allegedly in vindication of his honor. As a matter of fact he&nbsp; admitted having&nbsp; planned his vengeance long before the opportune moment came to carry it out.<br><br>Regarding the contention that running amuck is a cult among&nbsp; the Moros that is age-old&nbsp; and&nbsp; deeply rooted and should be distinguished from murders where the murderer is not resigned to&nbsp; expiate his offense by being killed unlike the amuck, the claim is likewise unmeritorious.&nbsp; Our penal laws enumerate the circumstances which mitigate criminal liability, and the condition of&nbsp; running amuck is not one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; In so far as they are applicable they must be applied alike to all&nbsp; criminals be they Christians,&nbsp; Moros or Pagans.&nbsp; More so in the case of the accused who though Moro by blood, has however settled for many years before the&nbsp; occurrence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; tragedy&nbsp; in Christian community and&nbsp; lived&nbsp; there with a&nbsp; Christian&nbsp; common-law&nbsp; wife&nbsp; and relatives.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; such atmosphere, he must&nbsp; have been indoctrinated into the Christian way of life to such an extent that he should have known that running&nbsp; amuck&nbsp; is abhorred in our society and punished by our law.&nbsp; He cannot even&nbsp; invoke&nbsp; in his favor&nbsp; what&nbsp; Section 106&nbsp; of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu accords to a Moro who commits a crime and is convicted, for even then said section&nbsp; gives to the Court ample discretion to determine the penalty to be imposed considering the circumstances of the case, the degree of&nbsp; his instruction,&nbsp; and nature of the crime committed, the Court being justified&nbsp; in imposing the penalty which would best serve the interest of justice. This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a case where the degree of perversity of the criminal warrants not mercy&nbsp; but the enforcement of the law to its full extent.<br><br>We are, therefore, constrained&nbsp; to hold that&nbsp; the accused is guilty beyond doubt of the crimes of&nbsp; multiple murder, frustrated&nbsp; murder, and attempted murder, all qualified by evident premeditation as&nbsp; charged in&nbsp; the information. The murder of Filomena Baaco, Baudilla Pacho, Salome Baaco, Leonila&nbsp; Llavan, Urbana Abique, Lilia Paz, Aurelia Paz, Herminia Paz, Lolita Yayen, Felisa&nbsp; Adion,&nbsp; Nenita Sausa, Henry Pacaldo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Manuela Llavan, was attended by the aggravating circumstances of treachery and dwelling.&nbsp; The murder of Maxima Pacho, Romana Pacho and Fortunate&nbsp; Nares, the frustrated murder&nbsp; of Manuel Adion and&nbsp; the attempted murder of Pablo Paz and Severino Adion, were committed with the aggravating circumstance of treachery.&nbsp; The aggravating circumstance of treachery in the sixteen&nbsp; murders, one&nbsp; frustrated murder and two attempted&nbsp; murders is&nbsp; however offset by the mitigating circumstance of plea guilty.<br><br>With&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; murder of the&nbsp; accused common-law wife, Maxima Pacho, his sister-in-law, Romana Pacho,&nbsp; and the latter's nephew, Fortunato Nares,&nbsp; the frustrated murder&nbsp; of Manuel Adion and&nbsp; attempted&nbsp; murder of&nbsp; Pablo Paz and Severino Adion, the penalty should be imposed in its medium period.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; murder of Maxima Pacho, Romana Pacho and Fortunato Nares, the penalty should be <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, in the frustrated murder of Manuel Adion,&nbsp; the defendant should be sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 2 months and&nbsp; 1 day of <i>prision correctional</i> as minimum to 12 years and&nbsp; 1 day of <i>reclusion temporal </i> as maximum.<br><br>For each&nbsp; of the two&nbsp; crimes of attempted murder, the defendant should be&nbsp; sentenced to suffer an&nbsp; indeterminate penalty of 4 months&nbsp; and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> as minimum to&nbsp; 6 years and&nbsp; 1 day of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum.<br><br>The indemnity&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of each&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased should be P6,000.00.<br><br>Wherefore, modified as above&nbsp; indicated, the&nbsp; decision appealed from&nbsp; is hereby affirmed in all other respects, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Endencia,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Barrera, JJ.</i> concur.</div>
