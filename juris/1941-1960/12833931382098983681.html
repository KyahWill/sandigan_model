				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">After the corresponding trial before the Court of First Instance of
 Abra, Mardo Tuazon, 28, was sentenced, for murder, to reclusion 
perpetua and to pay P4,000.00 to the heirs of the deceased Catalino 
Darisay. He appealed in due time.
  <p>  Accoording to the evidence of record, Catalino Darisay left his 
home town of Dolores, Abra in 1947 to improve his economic conditions in
 Cotabato, mandanao. Eight years later, he returned for a short visit 
with his aunt Cornelia Darisay, arriving in Tayum, Abra, on October 29, 
1955. That very morning he took leave of her to visit his grandfather 
Teodoro Britos. She never saw him again. As he had agreed to return to 
Cotabato with her after the town fiesta on November 25, 1955, and as he 
did not show up, Cornelia Darisay decided to call upon Teodoro Britos. 
The latter informed her that Catalino had stayed in his house for two 
days and then proceeded to the poblacion of Dolores accompanied by him 
(Britos). The old man said he left Catalino in Dolores, because the 
latter wanted to proceed to the barrio or sitio called Pudoc, whereas he
 had to, and did, return to his house. Admitting he never saw Catalino 
again, he however refused to accompany Cornelia when she announced her 
intention to report the matter to the municipal authorities. It seems, 
according to his own testimony, he had already given notice of 
Catalino's disappearance.</p>
  <p>  Inquiries failed to elicit information regarding Catalino's 
whereabouts.</p>
  <p>  Then on December 18, 1955, Roberto Tejero, 27, while looking for 
his horse stumbled across some human bones and a skull, in sitio  
Nagalangan, Dolores. Nearby were a pair of rubber shoes, a cap, and a 
leather belt shown to have been worn by Catalino the day he went to 
Dolores. Expert testimony affirmed that the human remains could be those
 of a man of the age and physique of Catalino. In fact, everybody agrees
 he died.</p>
  <p>  Notified of the find and Catalino's disappearance, the 
constabulary authorities aarrested Oricolo Balneg whose hut appeared to 
be the one nearest to the place of Tejero's discovery. After some 
hesitation, he revealed the grim story of how Catalino had been killed 
by Mardo Tuazon. "On October 31, 1955," he said in court, "Catalino came
 to ask the location of the cornfield that belonged to his mother. I was
 then plowing my farm. I showed him the place, and then we went to my 
hut. It was about midday. Then he asked me the way to Pudoc. I pointed 
the way, went with him up to a distance of about 500 meters. When we 
reached the gate of my cornfield, I noticed that that Mardo Tuazon was 
following Darisay, who in turn was following me. Then Mardo Tuazon told 
Catalino to wait for him. Catalino stopped walking, and suddenly Mardo 
Tuazon boloed Catalino even as he exclaimed 'So you have come to get the
 land of my wife.' Catalino fall dead. Mardo threatened me with death 
should I reveal the incident."</p>
  <p>  Oricolo Balner withstood a thorough cross-examination, and 
impressed with his sincerity, the Hon. Felix R. Domingo, Judge, rendered
 a verdict of guilt in a well-prepared decision explaining and analyzing
 the proofs on both sides. Motive for the crime was this. Catalino had 
come to claim, as inheritance from his mother, the land under 
cultivation by Mardo, which Britos had given to his stepdaughter, who 
was Mardo's wife.</p>
  <p>  The evidence offered by the accused set up practically three 
lines of defense: (a) Oricolo Balneg killed Catalino; (b) Catalino could
 not have been killed in October 31, 1955, because on November 7, 1955, 
he went with his grandfather Teodoro Britos to Dolores; (c) alibi.</p>
  <p>  As to the first, two policemen reported that, when he was brought
 to the municipal building for investigation, Balneg confessed to having
 killed Catalino Darisay. But these witnesses admitted that the 
confession went further; he killed <u>at the instigation of this 
appellant</u>, who paid him P50.00. This point, therefore, does no help 
the defense.</p>
  <p>  The second derives no importance, because if it is true that 
Catalino went to Dolores on November 7, 1955, then the murder occurred 
on that date, Oricolo having merely committed a mistake as to the date 
of the deadly assault, He is illiterate, be it noted. Anyway, this 
defense led to mainly on the testimony of Teodoro Britos whose sincerity
 the judge openly doubted, not only because he has interests adverse to 
the deceased (he had disposed of, and was profiting partly from the land
 which Catalino wanted to get) but also because he made no serious 
efforts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to locate his 
missing grandson, beyond notifying the authorities, after a long time at
 that. (last part of November, 75 s.n.) He did not call on Cornelia 
Darisay in Tayum who he knew had accompanied Catalino from Minadanao 
(just in case Catalino had rejoined her, instead of coming back to 
Lubluba). He did not ask other persons (except his brother and sister) 
about Catalino. Instead, he said he looked for Catalino <u>in the bushes
 of Pudoc</u>, as if he had a premonition that his grandson lay there. 
Mardo Tuazon himself did not knew that Teodoro Britos was looking for 
his grandson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2a]</sup> Very 
peculiar indeed, because he would be the first whose help Britos would 
ask, being married to the latter's stepdaughter and living only a few 
meters away from his house.</p>
  <p>  As to the alibi, it is supported principally by the testimony of 
Britos and of the accused himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 Of Britos, no further comment need be added. On the other hand, the 
accused deserved no credence, he having made on cross-examination 
statements highly improbable in the ordinary course of life. These are 
related in the following paragraphs of the appealed decision:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"On cross-examination, he admitted that his wife, even before he 
married her before the war, was living with Teodoro Britos and that 
after their marriage be became a tenant of Teodoro Britos. He was not 
informed how many children Teodoro Britos had who would inherit the 
latter's lands which he, the accused, was working on as a tenant. 
Neither did it interest him to know, nor was he told, that Teodoro 
Brtios had grandchildren in Mindanao. Asked whether in the month of 
October, 1955 he saw new faces in Lubluba where he then resided he 
denied that he saw new faces therein. He admitted that his house was 
only about thirty meters away from the house of Teodoro Britos, and that
 they draw their water from a common well. The accused stated that on 
October 31, 1955, he was in his house but was working on a land which is
 within shouting distance from his house.  Asked if it is not true that 
it was customary between his family and that of Teodoro Britos to help 
each other entertain visitors, he denied such cooperation stating that 
each family entertains its own visitors exclusively. He also denied that
 on November 6 and 7, 1955, he noticed a new face, a visitor, in the 
house of Teodoro Britos but admitted that sometime near Christmas time 
in 1955 Teodoro Britos was looking for a relative who disappeared. x x 
x."</p>
    <p>"In answer to questions propounded by the Court, he stated that 
although his house is only thirty meters away from that of Teodoro 
Britos, he did not know of the presence of Catalino Darisay in the house
 of Teodoro Britos, and that he was informed only by the latter of the 
disappearance of Catalino Darisay before December, 1955. He denied 
knowledge of whether his own wife who is the daughter of the second wife
 of Teodoro Britos visited the house of the latter during the last days 
of October and early days of November, stating further that his wife 
never told him that there was a visitor in the house of her (wife's) own
 mother. He further stated that he had been married exactly eleven years
 before into the family of Teodoro Britos but during that period Teodoro
 Britos never mentioned to him that the latter had relatives in Mindanao
 nor had he learned from any of their neighbors that such relatives were
 living in Mindanao. x x  x."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    Needless to say, an emigrant to Mindanao, (land of promise to 
Ilocano farmhands) who visits his home-town after an absence of eight 
years, could not have failed to excite the interest of the neighborhood.
 And one who has married into a family is supposed to know the immediate
 members thereof specially if he maintains contact with its head.</p>
  <p>    There is another witness to the alibi: Meno Quinto, another old
 man (80). But he spoke of being with Mardo on November 7, the day 
Catalino went, according to Teodoro Britos, to Pudoc. Yet, it is quite 
certain the crime occured on October 31, the same Britos having admitted
 that Catalino stayed in his house <u>two days only</u>. (104 s.n.) At 
any rate, Meno's account proved to be unreliable when he showed on the 
witness stand how poor was his memory concerning dates.</p>
  <p>    Going back to the lone eye-witness, appellant's counsel 
vigorously assail his veracity, contending that his declarations were 
"unnatural, improbable, unbelievable and unthinkable." They cite no  
less than eight instances, supported by quotations from the stenographic
 notes, wherein he allegedly contradicted himself or made assertions 
contrary to the natural course of human events.</p>
  <p>    We have read these quotations; as presented, however, they seem
 out of context. Interpreted in connection with other statements they do
 not so taint the testimony with signs of incredibility as to make it 
unacceptable. Indeed, the instances — most of them — were called to the 
attention of the trial judge, who ignored them altogether in giving full
 credit to Balneg's eye-witness account. We have found the sufficient 
reason to disagree with His Honor's appraisal of the circumstantial and 
direct evidence introduced at the trial of this case. </p>
  <p>    The attack was sudden and fatal. In the eyes of the law it was 
murderous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the appealed judgment will be affirmed with costs 
against appellant.</p>
