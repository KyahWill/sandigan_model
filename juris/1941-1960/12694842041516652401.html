				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. AURELIO ALVERO (ALIAS RELI), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Aurelio Sevilla Alvero <em>alias</em> Reli was charged with treason
on twenty-two (22) counts (Annex A) before the People's Court, After
trial, said Court in a 45-page decision penned by Judge Jose S.
Bautista, Associate Judge of said Court, concurred in by Associate
Judges Dizon and Tancinco, found the defendant guilty on all counts
except the 10th relative to his interview v/ith Leonardo Garcia, and
the 18th which refers to his alleged ordering, helping in and causing
the burning of the buildings west of Taft Avenue and south of Libertad
street in Pasay, and sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with the
accessories of the law, to pay a fine of P10,000 plus costs, crediting
him with one-half of the preventive imprisonment; he has already
suffered.
<p> Appealing from that decision of conviction, Alvero in a 112-page
brief, assails the decision, assigning forty-two (42) errors said to
have been committed by the trial court, asking that the judgment of
conviction be totally reversed and that he be acquitted. The Solicitor
General in a 103-page brief examines and reviews the voluminous record
of the evidence, analyzes and discusses it in detail in connection with
the information, count by count, endeavors to refute the allegations
and arguments of appellant in support of his assignment of errors and
recommends that the judgment be affirmed. Considering the gravity of
the offense charged, the time spent and the efforts made by both
appellant and the appellee in analyzing the evidence and later
embodying their views and contentions in their briefs, we have devoted
considerable time and accorded much attention and care in studying this
case, scrutinizing the extensive and voluminous evidence both oral and
documentary, and given careful consideration of the questions of fact
and law raised before us. In our decision, we shall try to follow the
order and sequence adopted by the trial court in the consideration and
determination of the different counts.</p>
<p> The People's Court grouped the 22 counts under three main
classifications—economic, political, and military collaboration. Under <em>economic collaboration</em>,
come counts 2 and 3 referring to appellant's business or trading
activities, buying war materials and selling them to the enemy, under
his company called ASA TRADING which trade-name stands for his name
Aurelio Sevilla Alvero. In <em>political, collaboration</em> are
included three groups, namely: the letter of congratulations to
President Laurel relative to his declaration of war against the United
States and Great Britain (count 4); defendants membership in the
KALIBAPI (count 1); and the formation and organization of the New
Leaders' Association (counts 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 19, 21, and 22), Under <em>military collaboration</em>,
come five groups, which are: defendant's relations with and membership
in the MAKAPILI (counts 5 and 20); his organization of the "Bisig Bakal
Ñg Tagala" (counts 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17); the meeting at the
Ayuntamiento de Manila ([City Hall], count 17); organization of OUR
PEOPLE'S OWN GUERRILLA ([O.P. O. G.], count 11); and the burning of
buildings in Pasay (count 18), The last seven pages of the decision of
the trial court ate devoted to discussion and findings on the
appellant's adherence to the enemy.</p>
<p> After the submission of the briefs by both parties, Amnesty
Proclamation No. 51 dated January 28, 1948, was promulgated. Invoking
the benefits of said Amnesty Proclamation, appellant filed a motion for
dismissal of the cultural, political and economic counts of the
inforanation. The Solicitor General appears to be agreeable to said
motion, having signed at the bottom of said motion under the word
"conforme". In a resolution dated March 17, 1948, this Court advised
the parties that said motion for dismissal will be acted upon when the
case is considered on the merit. Said motion will be passed upon and
considered later in this deeisione</p>
<p> The appellant admitted in open court that he is a Filipino citizen.</p>
<p align="center">ECONOMIC COLLABORATION </p>
<p> Under this heading, counts 2 and 3, the People's Court found that
in the month of August, 1943, Alvero established a business in the "buy
and sell" of automobile spare parts, considered as war materials, at
the corner of Dasmariñas and Markina streets, Manila under the name ASA
TRADING. He began with a capital of P15,000.00 and when he closed his
business about the end of the year 1944, he had accumulated a net
profit of P2,000,000. With this he bought a house in July, 1944,
costing P300,000 and he allegedly subsidized or undertook to subsidize
his New Leader's Association from these profits.</p>
<p> While appellant claims that he did not want to deal in war
materials and bought and sold only clocks, hinges, hasps, books,
clothing, and small auto and truck spare parts, the evidence which
consists mostly of the testimonies of his own officials and employees
of the ASA shows that he sold mostly automobile spare parts, rotors,
brake arms, carburetors, pumps, diaphragms, tires, batteries,
automobile bulbs, lamps, spark plugs, electric wires, bolts,
compressors, chain blocks, locks, hinges and other electrical equipment
and hardware, bought and acquired from agents. Defendant in his
testimony admitted that his stock consisted of automobile parts which
were needed for transportation and that no car will run without any of
said parts. The appellant insists that in his business he did not want
to deal with the Japanese and that he had instructed his employees not
to sell any of his stock to them, but there is abundant evidence to
prove and the People's Court rightly found that the only purchasers of
materials from his stocks were the Japanese, and on a big scale, and
that it was he who in most cases, personally closed the deals with the
Japanese purchasers and collected the sales price. For instance, he
made several sales to Capt. Ohasi of the Japanese Navy which in all
amounted to P2,000,000. Takatori of the Philippine Commodities
Purchasing Association, which was the procurement agency of the
Japanese Imperial Forces bought from the defendant during the latter
part of 1944 materials valued at half a million pesos (P500,000). An
entry in his diary (Exhibit ZZ) dated November 16, 1944, at 9:35 a.m.
states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "I arrived in the office with Sato Koyzo and his
soldiers preparing for the report of half of my bodega stock. I am
thankful to Major _________________ and Mr. Takatori for their kindness
and cooperation, which will enable me to concentrate on my work for my
country."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Koyzo was an agent of the Kobe Marine. On December 11, 1944, he
noted down in his own diary (Exhibit ZZ) at 3:30 p.m. the followings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"After completing the itemization of the remaining
stock for Mr. Wasizuka I went with Mr. Kawa to Kobe Marine, the buying
house of Akatsu Kubatai. Mr. Uta informed us that we need the signature
of Capt. Ukamoto at the Kumiyan (?)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On November 15, 1944, at 10:35 a.m., he noted down in his diary Exhibit X the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Virgy (Virginia Floro Claudio) informed me at the
Nippon Bunka Kaikan that Maj. Yorisiko Moriyama and Mr. Takatori were
in my office to buy up my remaining stock * * *. As I was walking to
the office, I felt gratified by the thought of the spirit of
cooperation of Major Moriyama and Mr. Takatori. Very incidentally I had
told Mr. Takatori the reasons for my absence from my office and my
attendance to my business, namely, my activities in the 'League of
Patriotic Filipinos' and in the 'New Leaders Association', Interested
in my endeavors he communicated the matter to Major Moriyama, who,
without losing time, ordered that my entirestock be bought up so as to
give me the freedom which is needed for my patriotic work."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> It will be seen later that for lack of identification, we held
Exhibit X to have been improperly admitted; however, during the bail
hearing, appellant admitted that the portion of the diary reproduced
regarding the coming of Takatori to his office and wanting to buy his
remaining stock, was correct, and he told the court that for that
remaining stock he demanded P850,000.00, based on his inventory and the
current prices.</p>
<p> Then on November 16, 1944, at 3:45 p.m« we find this entry in his diary Exhibit ZZ:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Proceeded to the Kobe Marine for business. Met Mr.
Takatori who offered me once again his assistance in order to close my
business."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to and confirms the contents of the next preceding entry.</p>
<p align="center"> POLITICAL COLLABORATION </p>
<p> Under this heading, count 4, the evidence shows and the People's
Court found that the day following the declaration of war or state of
war made by President Laurel of the Puppet Republic, the appellant
addressed the following letter in tagalog which translated into English
reads as follows:</p>

<p>The corresponding check for P10,000 was inclosed in the letter, all
of which he delivered to Arsenio N. Luz, then, Chairman of the Board of
Information of Malacanan asking him to deliver it to President Laurel
and later to publish it in the papers. The letter with the check was
eventually delivered to the addressee and was published in the Tribune,
then owned and controlled by the Japanese. On September 30, 1944, he

<p>On September 25, 1944, the defendant wrote his mother Rosa Sevilla the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Through this I am letting you know as I told you on
the afternoon of tie day before yesterday that I have already sent to
President Jose P« Laurel my voluntary offer of service.</p>
  <p>"I
don't know if you will consider the steps I chose as right and I don't
know what response the President will give me * * * from the moment the
declaration of a state of war with the United States of America and
Great Britain was proclaimed, it is but right for every citizen to cut
his relations with the enemy, not only because it is right but also
because It is the dictate of the spirit. And whoever takes side with
the enemy Is not only against Japan but it can also be said that he is
a traitor to our dear Philippines.</p>
  <p> "So don't regret the
steps I took because it way endanger my life, you should rather rejoice
because your son has learned to comply with his duties." (Exhibit XXX,
pp. 139-140; Exhibit "J", pp. 29-30, Rec. of exhibits.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under count No. 1 the evidence reveals and the trial court found
that Alvero joined the KALIBAPI (Kapisanan Sa Paglilinkod Sa Bagong
Pilipinas), on December 20, 1942, first acting as supervisor of the
Educational and Scientific Section of said association and later on
acting as head of its Cultural Division of the Bureau of Political
Affairs. One of the main objectives of said association was to assist
the Filipinos in comprehending the significance of the principles of
the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, strengthen their adherence
thereto, secure; to the New Philippines its rightful place in said
sphere, adhere strictly to the policies of the Imperial Japanese Forces
in the Philippines in their administration, render service in the
establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and
contribute to its advancement. As a high official of the KALIBAPI the
appellant lectured before its Labor Institute about three times a week,
urging and preaching that the Filipino culture can be saved from
destruction by the Occidentals only through joining hands with other
Orientals to establish a new order under the Greater East Asia
Co-Prosperity Sphere., He said that the new order demanded the
dissolution of the institutions which in their nature and in their
organization recall the <em>past regime</em>. He proposed the creation
of an Institute of Spiritual Training to carry out the purposes of the
KALIBAPI stating that "342 years of indoctrination towards things and
thoughts Occidental and the k2 years of the inculcation of blind
confidence in America make of spiritual regeneration a task that
demands doing immediately and within the shortest possible time." He
urged that the said institution should take charge of the orientation
of the members of the USAFFE who were released without such training in
internment camps and the destruction of the pernicious influence of
thoughts occidental. He suggested as subjects for lectures before said
institution topics like "Retreat of America", the "Fallacy of
Educational Policies of the American Regime", the "Fallacy of
Philippine-American Political Relations", "Betrayal of a Promise", "The
Philippines and the Co-Prosperity Sphere", and "Eyes to the Rising
Sun". However, on July 30, 1943, he wrote a letter of resignation to
Pio Duran, resigning from the KALIBAPI stating his disappointment and
disgust with the manner the KALIBAPI was being run and because he was
not given the opportunity to further promote and develop the policies
of said association. After stating his opinion that "the KALIBAPI
stands and will stand always as far as I am concerned, the symbol, the
dream that must some day be realized" he said among other things:</p>
<blockquote><p> "Before the Institute of Labor, I delivered speeches for the New
Order, and immediately after those speeches. I have heard my immediate
'bosses' applaud my oratory but dispute my arguments for the
Co-Prosperity Sphere. <em>Quo vadis</em>? Under such circumstances, I really can not continue,"</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> "* * * "I was so isolated by Anti-New Philippines elements that I
found myself face to face with a desk with nothing to do and nothing to
be responsible for."</p></blockquote>
<p> Under counts 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 19, 21, and 22, the record shows and
the People's Court found that about November, 1944, the appellant
together with Pio Duran, Kawamoto, and Saburo Yoshida who was connected
with the Political Bureau of the Japanese Army and at the same time
Director of the Nippon Bunka Kaikan, an organization in charge of
dissemination of Japanese Propaganda, unit of the Hodobu of the
Department of Information of the Japanese Army, later attached to the
Japanese Embassy in Manila, organized the <em>New Leaders' Association</em>
among whose objectives according to its Articles of Association were:
to unify and encourage the ideals and aspirations of young people who
are taking an active part in the noble task of nation building <em>in
close collaboration with the various Japanese organizations in other
East Asia countries so that the people of Asia may actually participate
in all out efforts to win the present war and therefore establish the
Co-Prosperity Sphere</em>. The appellant redrafted the Articles of
Association which were later approved, and then signed by him, Duran,
Yoshida and others, Alvero was first designated and acted as a member
of the Board of Directors of the Association, but later on the Board
passed a resolution promoting him to the post of Assistant Director
General, next to Yoshida who gave him full authority to organize the
offices of the Association and to make appointments according to his
best judgment. The appellant according to himself became the <em>factotum</em>
of the association. To show the close relation between this New
Leaders' Association and the Japanese Armed Forces, the evidence shows
that the offices of the Association were furnished by the Nippon Bunka
Kaikan next to its offices in the Heacock Building and during the
period of organization its expenses were subsidized by the Nippon Bunka
Kaikan. The funds of the association came from contributions of
Japanese individuals and Japanese commercial houses and were then paid
out by Kawamoto, the cashier of the Nippon Bunka Kaikan. The budget of
the Association was submitted to said cashier for auditing and
approval. Next to the offices of the New Leaders' Association were
housed the different propaganda agencies of the Japanese Armed Forces
such as the Nippon Bunka Kaikans the broadcasting radio station PIAM,
and the Eiga Haikusha, a Japanese motion picture company.</p>
<p> Among other things the by-laws of the New Leaders' Association
prepared by the accused himself provided that the Board of Advisers
shall be composed of three representatives of the Imperial Japanese
Army, a representative of the Imperial Navy, the Director of the
Department of Information, three representatives of the Japanese
Embassy, a representative of the Japanese Military Police and nine
prominent Filipinos popularly known for their pro-oriental attitude.
According to his diary (Exh. ZZ) he entered into negotiations with
Yoshida and the Japanese Embassy regarding the transfer of the office
and activities of the Nippon Bunka Kaikan, which was the Japanese
entity in charge of Japanese propaganda, to the New Leaders'
Association.</p>
<p> The following entries in appellant's diary (Exhibit ZZ) show the
intimate relations maintained by the appellant with Japanese high
officials and the interest taken by the latter in the organization of
the New Leaders' Association:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Went to Director General Yoshida's apartment where
I had the pleasure of meeting very encouraging men like
___________________ Nakashima, director of the New Philippine Cultural
Institute, Mr. Uno of the PIAM, Mr, Togo of the Army and a Mr.
__________________ of the Navy. I took up with Director General Yoshida
the question of appointment as also my plan of gradation in membership.
I find working with Director Yoshida a great pleasure for he is a very
encouraging man." (Exh. ZZ, p. 24, entry at 5:05 p.m., Nov. 25, 1944.)</p>
  <p>"I
could not leave immediately though because I was having a conference
with Mr. ________________ Uno of the Hodobu, He turned over to me the
broadcasting material of the Patriotic Guerrilla Association." (<em>Id</em>., p. 1, entry at 2:10 p.m., Nov. 16, 1944.)</p>

Mr. _________________ of ___________________ they told me that they
would be good collaborators with us in our work." (<em>Id</em>,, p. 7, entry at 2:00 p.m., Nov. 18, 1944.)</p>
  <p>"Before we parted, Director General Yoshida took me to his room to discuss important secret matters." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 9, entry at 3:30 p.m., Nov. 19, 1944.) (Italics ours.)</p>
  <p>
"After dinner I had a conference with Director General Yoshida and Mr.
Kawamoto, and Director General Yoshida in that parley supported my
views and pledged me his backing in the activity of the NLA." (<em>Id.,</em> pe 19, entry at 5:30 p.m., Nov. 23, 1944.)</p>
  <p>
"At the Manila Hotel I met Mr. __________________ Taka, the only new
man to me in the gathering as the others were already known to me. Mr.
Yasta, Director General Yoshida and Mr. Kawa. We discussed many points.

  <p>"Mr. Okahashi arrived and he was a nice humored man and we talked about a lot of things, <em>our plans, our aims</em>, etc." (<em>Id</em>., p. 35, entry at 10:20 p.m., Dec. 2, 1944.) (Italics ours.)</p>
  <p> "Mr. Mori dropped in so we could go out to gether * * * and I exchanged views on activities for the youth movement," (<em>Id</em>., p. 39, entry at 11:25 a.m., Dec. 8, 1944.)</p>
  <p> "I had a <em>closed door conference</em>
with Director General Yoshida, Mr. Kawa, Mr. Yasta and Mr. Kobayashi
regarding the financial and underground work of the Assn." (<em>Id.</em>, p. 41, entry at 6:05 p.m., Dec, 10, 1944.) (Italics ours.)</p>
  <p>
"Punctually, I was fetched by the Navy car to go to Col» Aoyama's home
for a parley. I explained my philosophy, my ideology for the NLA, as
also my plan of objectives, * * * Mr. _______________ and Mr.
_______________ as also Col. Aoyama were very appreciative of my
plans." (<em>Id</em>., p. 42, entry at 6 p.m., Dec. 11, 1944).</p>
  <p>
"I was further delayed by discussing with Mr. Puzi and Mr. Kawa as they
were insistent on expanding immediately and I was adamant, on central
organization first." (<em>Id</em>., p. 45, entry at 7:45 p.m., Dec. 15, 1944.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Appellant prepared the 5-point program of objectives for the New
Leaders' Association (Exhibit I) which was submitted to aad approved by
Director General Yoshida on December 3, 1944 (Exhibit L). One of the
objectives in that 5-point program was "collaboration with the
Governments the <em>Imperial Japanese Army and Navy in the safeguarding of Public Works and Communication facilities."</em>
Other objectives were "pacification efforts", establishment of a
rejuvenation center, propagation of Nippongo (which he himself had been
teaching), and a movement for the changing of the names of all the
people for the obliteration of Western Dominance (Exhibit I).</p>
<p> In this connection, one may pause and observe, as the People's
Court also well points out, that while President 0sme.ua at the time
was urging the Filipinos to "strike whea the tide of battle reaches
your town or barrios. On that day, strike hard against the
enemy—wherever you find him—and fight—fight as did Lapulapu and Dagohoy
and Gregorio del Pilar—without counting the cost," the appellant
through his New Leaders' Association, was preaching and trying to
secure pacification; and while General MacArthur was urging the people
to "avoid any assistance to the enemy, but on the contrary, harass him
incessantly, disrupting his <em>means of communication and his essential lines,"</em>
one of the objectives of defendant's New Leaders' Association was to
collaborate with the Japanese Army and Navy in the safeguarding of
their <em>public works and communication facilities</em>.</p>
<p> Under count No. 19, the evidence shows and the People's Court found
that on December 1, 1944, Alvero granted an interview with a Japanese
named Kobayashi, and answering questions already prepared referring to
the position of the Philippines in the Pacific War, he saidj</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The Philippines, as a vital part of Asia, can not
maintain herself apart from the East Asian Nations in their struggle in
the Greater East Asia War, On the contrary, the Philippines,
considering the fact that she achieved her liberation as an early fruit
of the Greater East Asia War, is honor bound to make her cause one with
the other nations of the East," (Exh. U.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Under counts Nos. 21 and 22, the People's Court found and the
evidence supports the finding that on December 4, 1944, appellant
prepared a resolution which he had the New Leaders' Association adopt
and which he in the company of Pio Duran, Artemio Ricarte, Benigno
Ramos and other leaders of the Association, presented to a commander of
a Japanese certain unit of the/Navy, presumably of the Air branch. We
quote the resolution as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Whereas, the war of Greater East Asia is a war
being waged by all Greatas Asian Nations for the liberty and happiness
of their peoples.</p>
  <p>"Whereas, every triumph and every sacrifice
for the ultimate victory of the East becomes part of the great
tradition of glory of every nation in the East.</p>
  <p>"Whereas, the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron of the Imperial Japanese Forces in <em>Tagala </em>is blazing glory for the entire East in defense of the rights of the East in general and of the liberty and independence of <em>Tagala</em> in particular.</p>
  <p>"Whereas,
on the 2?th day of October, 1944, the Sikisima unit of the Kamikaze
Special Attack Squadron, in oblivion of all personal consideration,
sacrificed life and all by crash-diving against the vessels of the
American task force in a sublime offering for the greatness of the East
and for the freedom and independence of <em>Tagala</em>.</p>
  <p>"Whereas, such gallantry and spirit of self-sacrifice is worthy of emulation by the youth of all the nations of the</p>
  <p>
"Whereas, be it resolved, as it is hereby resolved, that the
congratulations and admiration of the New Leaders' Association be
conveyed to the proper authorities of the Imperial Japanese Forces in <em>Tagala</em> so that the gratitude of <em>Tagalan</em> youth may be made patent for the great sacrifice of the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron." '(Exhibit M-1.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The presentation, including the resolution was duly published in the
December 7, 1944, issue of the Tribune under the following heading and
item:</p>
<p align="center">"NEW LEADERS GROUP INSPIRED BY KAMIKAZE SQUADRON'S EXPLOITS</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Reflecting the Filipinos' admiration for the
gallant attack carried out by the death-defying members of the Kamikaze
Special Attack Squadron, the Few Leaders' Association yesterday adopted
a resolution expressing gratitude and admiration. The resolution was
presented to the naval authorities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> On December 15th the defendant prepared another copy of the
resolution in tagalog and delivered it to General Tominaga, Chief of
the Japanese Air Forces in the presence of a delegation of the New
Leaders' Association. Pictures of the presentation of the resolution to
the Mavy leader were taken and published in the Tribune. In -'bhls
connection, the People's Court referring to the diary of the appellant
himself said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Coincidio ademas, que, en la misraa mañana de
dichp dia 15 de Dicierabre hubo un bombardeo aereo en esta ciudad, y
segun dijo el General Tominaga al acusado y sus compañeros, el se iba
sn aquel dia a Leyte para dirigir personalmente la contra-ofensiva
aerea contra los americanos (<em>vease</em> testimonio de Roserido
Aterrado y el diario Exh. ZZ, pags. 44 y 45.) Fue tan grata, tan
oportuna, tan alentadora la presentacion de dicha resolueion, que el
General japones estrecho efusivamente la mano de todos y cada uno de
los miembros de la delegacioii (Ejch. ZZ, pags. 44 y 45)." Decision of
People's Court, p. 14.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> To shield himself from responsibility for the preparation and
presentation of this resolution of congratulations, appellant claims
that he acted under pressure and was compelled to make the presentation
of the resolution by a Japanese Kawamoto who had previously prepared
it. The People's Court however, rejected this defense, saying that the
text of the resolution shows the presence and use of the word tagala, a
name by which the accused alone designated this country; whereas even
the Japanese still knew and considered our home land as <em>Filipinas</em> and would, undoubtedly, have used said word <em>Filipinas</em> instead of <em>tagala</em>
if the resolution had really been drafted by a a Japanese, Furthermore,
the very diary of the defendant (Exhibit ZZ) which we quote below
disproves his assertion and on the contrary shows that it was he who
prepared the resolution and voluntarily and even with enthusiasm
delivered it to the Japanese High Command:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"After dinner, I immediately proceeded to the
preparation of the resolution of gratitude and admiration for the
exploits of the Kaori Unit." (Defendants diary of December 14, 1944, at
8:30 p.m.)</p>
  <p>"6:20 a.m.—Woke up early to the droning of
airplanes and the booming of anti-aircraft guns. Dressed up in haste as
there was the presentation of the Kaori resolution to be done.</p>
  <p>"7:20—Mr. Maniya came to the house for a copy of the resolution.</p>
  <p>
"8:35—After a breakfast amidst the booming; and noise of air-raids, Pat
and I started on my bike for the meeting place of the NLA. The air-raid
was in full blast, but we had to go on as we had agreed to meet in
spite of the air-raid,</p>
  <p> "9:20—I was the first at our meeting
place at the corner of Daitoa and Padre Faura. While waiting for the
others I met a dark beauty by the name of Aurora Zablan. After a minute
of conversation with her my companions arrived.</p>
  <p> "9:35—We
proceeded to the Villamor Hall which was the headquarters of the High
Commanding Officer of the Air Corps, General _____________Tominaga. He
received us with affability and after counter-reading (?) of the
resolution of gratitude and admiration for the exploits of the Kaori
Unit, Japanese Special Attack Squadron, he even shook the hands of each
and every member of the delegation. The presentation was solemn and
particularly significant because of the fact that there was an air-raid
when the presentation was being made." (Exh. ZZ, pp. 44-45. December
15, 1944.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"> MILITARY COLLABORATION</p>
<p> Under counts 5 and 20, it has been duly established by the evidence
and found by the People's Court that in November, 1944, the appellant
helped found and organize the MAKAPILI (Makabayang Kalipunan Ñg Mga
Pilipino) Patriotic League of Eilipinos at the New Philippine Cultural
Institute in San Juan, Rizal. Pio Duran invited appellant to this
meeting of the organization. Among those present at the meeting were
Benigno Ramos, Artemio Ricarte and several officials of the Political
Division of the Japanese Army, such as Kagiyaraa, Hayashida, and
Kodama. Alvero acted as secretary and took down the minutes. Besides
acting as secretary Alvero took an active and important part in the
discussion. One of the objectives of the association was to replace the
Constabulary reorganized by the Japanese regime after the surrender of
Bataan,which presumably, because of its pro-guerrilla leanings and
because of many desertions to the resistance forces, was being disarmed
by the Japanese. Among the aims of the MAKAPILI were to accomplish the
fulfillment of the obligation assumed by the pact of alliance with the
Empire of Japan, to shed the blood and sacrifice the lives of its
people with the lives of other East Asian nations in order to eradicate
Anglo-Saxon influence in East Asia; to mobilize the population for the
purpose of attaining self-sufficiency in food and other vital materials
necessary for the victory in the Asiatic War (Pacific War); to
collaborate unreservedly and unstintedly with the Imperial Japanese
Army and Navy in the Philippines, in such ways and means as may in the
joint judgment of the Imperial Japanese Forces and the Association be
deemed necessary and fruitful; and to propagate throughout the country
the principles for which the Empire of Japan and the other Asiatic
nations are now fighting in that great Pacific War. Because of the
non-arrival of a high ranking Japanese official scheduled to supervise
the meeting, the same was adjourned. The name of the association was
first agreed to be Kalipunan Ñg Mga Makabayang Pilipinos, At the second
meeting at Christ the King Convent in Espana Extension about ten days
later and attended by the same persons with the addition of Maj. Sato,
it was agreed to have President Laurel head the organization but
Kagiyama insisted that the intervention of or information to Laurel was
not necessary because the Japanese Army will go ahead with the organization whether Laurel liked it or not. Alvero signed the Articles
of Association as well as the by-laws. After the signatures, the
signers including the appellant went to the house of Representative
Pedro Vera in San Juan, Rizal where Gen, Nishimura, assistant chief of
staff of Gen. Yamashita was waiting for them, Pio Duran told Nishimura
that they were going to advise Laurel of the existence of the
Association, Nishimura answered that they may do so but he said that
whether Laurel liked it or not the Japanese Army will support them.
Later the name of the association's changed to Malcabayang Kalipunan
fig Mga Pilipino (MAKAPILI). <br></p><p>Paragraph 10 of the minutes taken down by
the appellant at the first meeting reads as follows::</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The Chair opened the period for discussion after the motions had been considered, and the important problem about the <em>feeding of the soldiers off the 'League'</em> was discussed, Mr, Ruperto Santiago, Jose I. Baluyot, Paulo Capa and others gave their views."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of high Japanese army officers attending the meeting of
organization and the determination of the said Army expressed through
Ms officials to back the organization whether Laurel liked it or not
shows the intimate connection and relation between the MAKAPILI (League
of Patriotic Filipinos) and the Japanese Armed Forces, Paragraph 10 of
the minutes above-quoted shows that the MAKAPILI was to be composed of
soldiers, and the Articles of Association clearly show that it was to
be a military or semi-military organization purposely organized to
fight side by side with Japan against the American forces aM the
members of the Filipino resistance movement.</p>
<p> The appellant insists that he joined the MAKAPILI against his will
and was forced to sign the Articles of Association, and that after
signing the same he abstained completely from taking part in its
activities, The evidence however, completely refutes this claim and as
the People's Court well asserts, appellant took quite an active part in
the organization of the association, participated in its activities
after the organization and he even had plans and aspirations of
occupying a high and important position in it. During the first meeting
of the association, where he acted as secretary and took down the
minutes, of seven (7) motions, 5 of them were fathered by him and he
seconded another one. He voluntarily signed the by-laws and in
compliance with orders of Benigno Ramos he prepared identification
cards for members of the MAKAPILI. It was first planned to give him the
rank of colonel and chief of the Department of Enlightenment but «rhen
this same post was given to another Mr. Lumbre, he (defendant) was
keenly disappointed. The following entry in his diary (Exhibit ZZ) is
enlightening.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "On my way to my office, I met Major Sato who was
introduced to me by Mr. Pio Duran at the first parley of the League of
Patriotic Filipinos, He was asking me to go with him to the
headquarters of the league (MAKAPILI), but I could not go because of my
appointment with Saito Koyzo in the office of the Kobe Marine."
(Exhibit ZZ, entry at 1:25 p.m., Nov. 17, 1944.)</p>
  <p> "Proceeded
to the Kobe Marine to keep my appointment. There I met Major
_________________ and Captain _________________ The Major inquired
about our league activities and he asked me what-my rank would be in
the newly organized league army. I answered him that according to plans
I was to be designated colonel and he jokingly answered that in that
event I would be two ranks his senior officer, * * * " (<em>Id</em>., p. 4, entry at 2:20 p.m.)</p>
  <p>"The
meeting of the Directors of the PL of F (Patriotic League of
Filipinos—Makapili) was opened with the announcement of the Plantilla
of the association. I was disappointed by the men of Mr. Ramos in the
plantilla, as many of them were green and incapable ones. To top this
the headship of the Department of Enlightenment which was reserved for
me by agreement between General Ricarte, President Duran and Executive
General Ramos had been handed over to Mr. Lumbre by Executive General
Ramos. I was hurt by this action in spite of the reason that they gave
that I was not in the office for some time, I knew that it was only a
reason being given by Mr. Ramos in order to put in his men for the
reason could not hold water as I was in a position to go because of my
activities in the NLA (New Leaders' Association) which fact was known
to him. I did not express my disappointment in an effort to hide my
emotions, but General Ricarte objected to my being deprived of the
position. He however replied that it was not a very important matter as
I could render services without being head of any department. Executive
General Ramos sensing objections against the injustice from any
quarters, immediately replied that if I could attend to the work, then
I should be retained as head of the Department of Enlightenment, while
Mr. Lumbre was to be transferred to the Secretariat. Various reports
were read and finally the question of manner of address was brought up
and General Ricarte proposed that the Tagalog title 'Tandis' be used in
addressing Executive General Ramos. On the other hand I proposed that
General Ricarte, as «Tayog» and Vice General Duran should be addressed
as 'Tayuyog'. The manner of address were unanimously approved. It was
already dark and the moon was already up when the meeting was
adjourned. President Duran took me home in his car." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 25, entry at 5:40 p.m., Nov. 26, 1944.)</p>
  <p>
"Debated with myself whether I should resign or not as Director of the
Department of Enlightenment of the Patriotic League of Filipinos.
Finally decided to leave the matter for the next day." (<em>Id.</em>, p. 30, entry at 10:30 p.m., Nov. 28, 1944.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rejecting the claim of the appellant as to his alleged involuntary
joining the MAKAPILI and of his abstaining from participating in its
activities the People's Court ironically gives us this picture:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"He aqui un hombre, que despu.es de <em>haber sido forzado</em>
a firmar la Escritura Social de una asociacion, acepta de la misma, de
buen gana, rangos, honores y distineiones, y hasta se resiente cuando
le postergan.</p>
  <p> "2. La activa y valiosa participacion del
acusado para el mayor lustre de la inauguracion de la MAKAPILI, no se
compagina con la alegada coaccion. Dice el diario:</p>
  <blockquote><p>'Back at
the NLA headquarters I gave instructions regarding the MAKAPILI
inaugural to those who were attending." (Exhibit ZZ, p. 38, entry at
3:30 p.m., Dec. 8, 1944.)</p></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p>'Arrived in front the
Legislative Building where the ceremonies of the MAKAPILI were to be
held. We helped out as much as we could, helped arrange the chairs and
divided the work of ushering." (<em>Id.</em>, entry at 4:10 p.m. of the same day.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;
'The speech of General Yamashita was short and forceful and I tried
my best to give the translation which I did as much power as I could. I
was rather surprised by my voice which was at that moment very powerful
instead of being hoarse as I expected it to be.' " (<em>Id</em>., entry at 5:10 p.m. of the same day.)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, appellant.tries to create a distinction between the
Kalipunan Ñg Makabayang Pilipino, the first name agreed upon at the
first meeting, and Makabayang Kalipunan Ñg Mga Pilipino to which it was
later changed and from which the word MAKAPILI was derived. The
People's Court found that there was no distinction or difference
between the two for they mean the same thing. This, aside from the fact
that at the hearing of his application for bail appellant admitted that
the organization Kalipunan Ñg Makabayang Pilipino was the same one
inaugurated on December 8, 1944, which in point of fact was the
Makabayang Kalipunan Ñg Mga Pilipino (MAKAPILI).</p>
<p>Continuing with appellant's <em>military collaboration</em> under counts 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, regarding the organization of the <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em>,
the record shows and the trial court found that th© appellant organized
said Bisig Bakal Ng Tagala as a military unit or body whose members,
were recruited from those of the. New Leaders' Association. Its main
objectives were to maintain peace and order and to procure foodstuffs
for distribution to the public. The objectives of that organization as
planned by the defendant was embodied in his memorandum (Exh. HH) dated
December 30, 1944, and addressed and delivered to Colonel Zusuki of the
Manila Defense Corps from which memorandum, we are making the following
quotations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We, therefore, approach you in all humility to offer the assistance of the <em>New Leaders' Association</em> in these difficult times in accordance with our plans which we herein take the liberty to set forth.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p> "In the struggle against the Americans, it would be
rather a stretch of fancy to expect the bulk of the Filipino1 nation to
fight them beside the Japanese soldiers. The truth must be faced: the
'Filipino' is not ready for that. At best, there will be some loyal
unto death to the ideals of the East, but one who says that all will
rally as a body against the Americans is really trying 'to pull
somebody's leg',</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
  <p>
"The most that the Japanese, therefore, should ask is this:. That the
'Filipinos' maintain their equanimity and keep peace and order. With
this achieved, a great assistance will have been given to the Japanese
forcest for, instead of training guns against the riotous people in
distraction of the arms of defense, peace and order in Maynila will
mean full-liberty for defense, <em>concentration towards defense by all the forces of Japan</em>.</p>

  <p>
"If the people had been trained in the past along that discipline of
the spirit which brings great glory to the men of the Imperial Japanese
Army and Navy, then perhaps there would be no need for our fears nor
for this memorandum. It is rather the misfortune of this Country to
have had <em>three hundred and more years of Spanish mis-education and forty and more years of American mis-education</em>,
the consequence of which is the unhappy corrosion of that moral fiber
vital for the maintenance of nations in times of storm and stress.</p>
  <p align="center"> "TOO LATE TO MARSHALL THE PEOPLE</p>

</blockquote>
<p> In this second memorandum (Exh. II) the defendant goes into details
such as the uniforms and insignias to be worn by the soldiers and
officers of the <em>Bisigbakal</em>, their arms, their food, salaries, means of transportation, etc.</p>
<p> On January 1, 1945, the appellant called the members of the New
Leaders' Association to a meeting and announced to them that .the
association was being converted Into a military organization to be
called <em>Bisig</em> <em>Bakal Ñg Tagala</em>, and urged them to join
it. Some of the members like Celso Ilagan and Rosendo Aterrado refused
to join the new organization, because they felt that eventually, as
members thereof, they would be called upon and compelled to fight
against their own people. The Bislgbakal was actually organised. It
received a limited amount of arms and armuni/tion/f including uniforms
and food from the Japanese Array and was drilled by a Japanese military
instructor. Members of the force were quartered at Sspana street and at
the Union Theological Seminary at Tennessee Street and were inspected
regularly by Yoshida. The Appellant had the rank of major. </p>
<p>About the middle of January and in the month of February, 1945, the
Japanese Army left the La Salle College and the Legarda Elementary
School buildings where they left a considerable amount of supplies and
equipment. The appellant and his soldiers of the Bisigbakal. armed and
in uniform took over these buildings, guarded the same and began to
distribute some of the food and supplies therein to the public. In the
course of the distribution, particularly in the Legarda Elementary
School the appellant told the beneficiaries of the distribution that
"he was not a pro-Japaneses neither was he a pro-American, but he was a
pro-Filipino and he urged and enjoined them "to fight anybody that will
take their country." It must be borne in mind that at that time the
American Forces of Liberation had already landed on the coasts of
Lingayen Gulf and were on their way to occupy central Luzon with Manila
as their main objective,, So, the appellant could not have had in mind
or referred to any one taking the country except the Americans and the
Filipino Guerrillas guiding and helping them in the act of liberation.
As the People's Court well said, the appellant could not have referred
to Japan and its forces because they were already in the Philippines,
well entrenched in the same. As a matter of fact, the appellant and his
<em>Bisigbakal</em> forces were closely cooperating with the Japanese in defending Manila.</p>
<p>Under count No., 17, there is evidence to show and the People's
Court correctly found that during the last half of January, 1945
Colonel Hashimoto of the Japanese Armed Forces, charged with the
defense of Manila, called a meeting at the City Hall, presided over by
Military Governor Leon Guinto. Attending that meeting were Pio Duran
representing the Makapili, Manuel de la Fuente representing the Home
Guards, Eduardo Quintos and Gregorio Lugtu representing the Manila City
Police, and appellant Alvero representing the <em>Bisigbakal</em>.
Alvero and the members of his staff who accompanied him were all in
uniform and were armed Officers of the Japanese Army, Navy and the
Military Police also attended. Hashimoto proposed to those present the
fusion of the different organizations they were representing into one
body in order to cope with the problem of peace and order, and asked
them to express their opinions, Alvero, the first to speak
fully'supported the proposed fusion in order, according to him, to
better maintain peace and order and suppress the subversive elements
like the guerrillas inasmuch as the City Police did not seem to be
doing anything then to suppress them, De la Fuente, Quintos, and Lugtu
testified that maintenance of peace and order in the City of Manila
was, at that time, understood to include the suppression of the
guerrillas because these were considered subversive elements who
disturbed peace and. order by killing Japanese soldiers and Japanese
spies.</p>
<p> Under count No. 11, there is evidence to show and the People's
Court found, although, we find said evidence to be short of the
two-witness rule, that the appellant about the latter part of November,
1944, prepared the pamphlet (Exhibit T) with a-drawing on the front
page prepared by Pablo Amorsolo, a member of the New Leaders'
Association, and had about 800 copies mimeographed and distributed. The
pamphlet was supposed to be the official organ of OUR PE0PLE'S OWN
GUERRILLA (O. P. O. G.), and gave the reader thereof to understand that
the Articles therein were written by Filipino guerrillas. It severely
and bitterly attacked and censured Japans America, the new Republic
under President Laurel, the Makapilis and even Alvero himself. The
attack against America and the guerrillas contains among other things
the following::</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In 1941 to 1942, our youth were sacrificed on
Bataan. The young soldiers of our Country, thinking that they were
fighting for freedom in their stand against Japan, sacrificed their
young lives. But really for what? That America may have time to prepare
in Australia." (Liberty, Exhibit T, p. 1)</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
  <p>
"We had been in the past the dupes of imperialistic peoples, and now we
refuse to continue to be their dupes. As Linco&amp;said, you can fool
some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time,
but not all of the people all of the time." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 2)</p>
  <p>"The people of this country are now divided into threes</p>
  <blockquote>

  <p>
"Second—America's hirelings, consisting of so-called guerrillas who are
only awaiting America's return for their soldier's pay, people who sell
their Country for paltriness! (<em>Id.</em>, p. 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"> "AMERICA AS LIBERATOR</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Forty-six years ago. America came to the
Philippines as her liberator. Because of this role, because of
America's promises to the Philippines, the Filipinos under Gen. Emilio
Agulnaldo fought the Spaniards until the latter were cornered in
Intramuros.</p>
  <p> "With Spain down—America, the liberator, changed
her attitude and she assumed the role of conqueror. Through a mock
Treaty of Paris where the small Philippines was sacrificed to pacify
America on the one hand and to white-wash the name of Spain on the
other, the Philippines was literally 'sold down the river'.</p>
  <p>
"Now, America asks the Filipinos to have faith on her, This time she
comes again as the liberator. This time she is asking the Filipinos to
fight Japan. She is asking the Filipinos to suffer, to starve, to die
as did the young men in the wilderness of Bataan." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 6)</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
  <p> "The O. P. O. G. warns the people: Do not be fooled by promises! Remember Dewey!" (<em>Id.</em>, p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> He does not even spare Pio Duran, Benigno Ramos, ani Artemio Ricarte as may be gleaned from the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"And now we ask: Who are the few being favored?</p>
  <p>"First
in the list, though not the Tayog, is the Tandis of the Ganaps—Señor
Don Excelentisimo Benigno Ramos, newspaperman. poet, pseudo-Tagalist,
pseudo-patriot, expert politician and first-class Heel. He will sell
the Philippines to the Japanese for 'a mess of pottage'. He utilizes
his Ganaps to fawn with the Japanese. Patriots! Watch this man! </p>
  <p>
"Second In the list, the Taguyod,—Vice Minister Pio Duran, lawyer,
politician, assemblyman and eel. He is so squeamish he can circulate
among Japanese as also among Filipinos. He is loved by pro-Japanese
like Benigno Ramos and loved by Filipinos like Laurel. Not only this,
he plays poker with guerrilla chieftains like Recto and Alunan, and
manages to be acceptable even to diehards like Osias and Roxas.
Patriots! Watch this man!</p>
  <p> "Third in the list, the
Tayog,—General Artemio Ricarte, an innocent tool because of his age, an
unfortunate patriot. Whereas Ramos is a Heel and Duran is an eel, the
old man Ricarte sadly does not know an eel. Because of his dreams of
grandeur, he is used by Ramoz and Duran for their ends. Patriots! Watch
this man!" (<em>Id.</em>, p. 11)</p>
  </blockquote><p> As to the Puppet Republic under Laurel he has the following to say:</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Time
and again, President Jose 'Pula-Puti' Laurel has delivered
high-sounding speeches about the need of the Republic of the support of
all patriotic Filipinos. He passionately asks the people to rally under
the flag of the Republic.</p>
  <p> "The Flag is all right! The idea
of the Republic is also good! But the men who administer the Republic
are mainly racketeers! They have done everything to fatten their selves!</p>
  <p>"But what have they done for the People? What can the Republic claim that the Republic has done for the people?" (<em>Id.</em>, p. 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> As for himself (Alvero), the pamphlet LIBERTY prepared by himself, has the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Aurelio Alvero, politician, lawyer, professor,
poet, writer, historian, linguist, youth leader and Cassanova, is now
the head of the 'New Leaders Association'.</p>
  <p> "He preaches
patriotism * * * 'Nationalism above all else' is his cry. To prove
this, he distributes coconuts at cost to the public * * * he even
pushes push-carts * * * and is willing, according to reports, even to
sweep the streets of Manila to prove his patriotism.</p>
  <p> "Of all
patriots, pseudo-patriots and professional patriots, he has a most
different approach. He blahfblahs in Tagalog in spite of his English
and Spanish Education. He even signs his name in ancient Tagalog
writing. He claims interest in the Tagalog language, Tagalog arts,
Tagalog culture and Tagalog history. He goes to the extreme of changing
our beloved Philippines to Tagal.</p>
  <p> "Of course, all that is
very nice * * * but it is too, too nice * * * Perhaps Aurelio Alvero,
the eternal 'Young man', in spite of his 'impotence', has learned
everything from.his mentor Pio Duran, and is fast developing the
technique of the Eel! </p>
  <p> "What Young Man Alvero is up to, we
really do not know. But we are suspicious * * * very suspicious * * *
We knew him in the past for his Young Philippines game and also for his
Kalturop tricks.</p>
  <p> "But Young Man Alvero should stop playing
games * * * it is high time he outgrew the nursery. * * * This is not
peace time; but War Times!</p>
  <p> "So we say: Young Man, Beware!" (<em>Id.</em>, p. 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Now, as regards Japan and the Japanese Armed Forces the same pamphlet LIBERTY among other things contains the followings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"On the other hand, now Japan wants us to fight
avowedly for our independence against America. But really for what? To
save Japan proper from being the battlefield of this war." (Liberty, p.
2)</p>
  <p align="center"> "JAPAN AS THE LIBERATOR</p>
  <p>"What has Japan done to the Philippines in the last three years that she was here?</p>
  <p> "Nothing for the Philippines; Everything for Japan!</p>
  <p>
"Japan won prestige for her Flag and added wealth to Japan by buying
our economic and industrial strength with bond paper money!</p>
  <p>"In
exchange, Japan gave the Philippines untold sufferings. The present
critical almost starvation conditions were caused by Japan's acts to
control the free life of the people. These acts, abetted by the Puppet
Republic, are killing the Philippines inch by inch.</p>
  <p> "It is
not to be denied that Japan granted the Philippines independence, but
only paper independence! The Philippines, it is true, gained one thing,
the recognition of the world to her right to be free. Up to this point,
Japan gets a merit, but her interference in the affairs of the Republic
score more demerits that easily drown out the lone merit that she has!</p>
  <p>
"Instances? There are plenty. Japan with the aid of the Puppet Republic
deprives the Filipinos of their homes. Japan with the aid of the Puppet
Republic deprives the Filipinos of their food, rice particularly. Japan
with the aid of the Puppet Republic compels the Filipinos to render
service for military purposes." (<em>Id.</em>, p. 4.)</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>

  <p>"First—Japan's
stooges, consisting of Government parasites, Makapili's traitors,
newspaper quislings, buy-and-sell«their-country people!" (<em>Id</em>., p. 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first it is hard to understand how the appellant could have dared
and taken the risk to publish the said pamphlet LIBERTY under the very
nose of the Japanese Armed Forces, especially the Military Police. One
phrase, sentence or paragraph of the article against Japan as above
reproduced would have been sufficient pass or ticket to the garrison
and torture chambers of the Japanese Military Police or to Fort
Santiago. The only reasonable explanation for this Immunity of the
appellant to arrest and torture by the Japanese is that he made the
publication with the knowledge and consent of the Japanese. This may be
gathered from an entry in his diary (Exhibit ZZ) on November 19, 1944,
at 3:30 p.m, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Before we parted. Director General Yoshida took me to his room to discuss <em>important secret matters</em>.
He wants me to organise an organization. I suggested that the O. P. O.
G. was the answer. I explained to him my concept of the C&amp;up to
fortify our states on the left hand, the O. P. O. G. doing the <em>destructive</em>
work; on the right hand, (the N.L.A. New Leaders' Association) doing
the constructive work; and on the center, the League of Patriotic
Filipinos (MAKAPILI) making a frontal attack. He saw my point and we
parted in agreement." (lnclusion and Italics ours)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Considering all the circumstances surrounding this case of the OUR
PEOPLE'S OWN GUERRILLA (O. P. O. G.) and the pamphlet LIBERTY supposed
to be its official organ prepared and published by the appellants there
would appear to be reason and logic in the opinion and finding of the
People's Court that the act of Alvero was a mere act of deceit and
pretense9 calculated and designed to sow confusion and dissension in
the ranks of the guerrillas and to persuade them not to fight with and
help the American Forces of Liberation. We quote with favor that part
of the People's Court decision on this point as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "De esto se inflere que la O. P. O. G. fue creada para servir al Japon y quo el enemigo es- taba al tanto del plan.</p>
  <p>"Era,
pues, pura engañifa la censura del acusado contra el Japon y su
ejercito, contra los Makapilis y contra si mismo. Con que objeto se
prepare el Exhibit T? America estaba viniendo entonces y no habia
tiempo que perder. Criticando y censurando al Japon y al Japonofilo
Alvero, criticando y censurando a los fanaticos Makapilis y a la
Republica de Laurel, presentandose como guerrillero, se capta la
simpatia y la eonfianza de la genuina guerrilla y el folleto seria
leido con el animo propicio y benevolo. Nadie hubiera hecho caso
entonces de las predieas pro-japonesas del acusado, pero con el disfras
de guerrillero y apelando al patrlotismo y al filipinismo, pod:da
seducir a algunos y sembrar la division y la confusion en el seno mismo
de la guerrilla. 'Divide y venceras.' Muy insidiosaraente decia en el
articulo, 'America as Liberator' (Exh. T. pag. 6):</p>
  <blockquote><p>" 'Under
such impending possibilities, the O. P. O. G. counsels the People to
refuse to be the instruments of any of the contending nations, but asks
the Filipinos to get arms from both sides so that we may be in a
position to make a bid for our <em>Freedom</em> in the only honrable way: Fight for it against all.</p>
  <p>'The O. P. O. G. warns the People: Do not be fooled by promises. ¡Remember Dewey!'</p></blockquote>
  <p>
"Nuestro pueblo y su guerrilla iban contra el Japon, y peleaban por
America. El aconsejar entonces 'to refuse to be the instruments of any
of the contending nations' no significa otra cosa mas que no sean
instrumentos de America, que se nieguen a pelear con los amerlcanos."
(Decision of trial court, pp, 35-36).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"> PETITION FOR DISMISSAL </p>
<p> Now, for a little digression. Considering the motion for dismissal
of the cultural, political and economic counts of the information,
filed by appellant and agreed to by the Solicitor General, based on
Amnesty Proclamation No. 51, of January 28, 1948, we have to give due
course to said proclamation and accord its benefits to those invoking
them like the appellant herein. The Amnesty on economic collaboration
may include the trading and business activities of Alvero in connection
with his ASA TRADING. One may contend that the economic collaboration
contemplated by the Amnesty Proclamation was trading with the enemy in
general—buying from and selling to it, whether said business dealings
indirectly benefited and aided the enemy. In the case of appellant, it
has been proven that he dealt mainly in war materials which he bought
from his agents and sold almost invariably and exclusively to the
Japanese Army and Navy, especially for their transportation facilities.
We all know that one of the vital things that Japan lacked in the
prosecution of the war was motor transportation. She confiscated almost
all the motor vehicles she found in the Philippines, used some of them
here and the rest she dismantled, shipping the engines and other
important parts to Japan.</p>
<p> Some one has said, perhaps with some exaggeration that the lowly
and ubiquitous jeep now flooding and crowding our streets and highways
won the war for America and her allies. The statement may not have been
seriously made, and may not be wholly true, but at least it conveys the
idea of the vital importance of transportation facilities in war. It
requires no stretch of the Imagination to see that the automobile spare
parts sold by the appellant to the enemy materially aided said enemy in
the war in the servicing and maintenance of its war motor vehicles,
atleast here, if not in Japan proper, so that defendant may in a sense
be regarded as having given aid to the enemy. However, inasmuch as the
Amnesty Proclamation speaks in general terms and makes no distinction
as to the kind and nature of the economic collaboration rendered, we
are not prepared to make such distinction in this case, and giving
appellant the benefit of the doubt, we are willing to apply as we
hereby apply the benefits of the Amnesty Proclamation to him and
consider as dismissed the counts in the information relative to
economic collaboration, particularly his commercial activities through
his ASA TRADING.</p>
<p>As regards cultural and political collaboration, that portion of the
Amnesty Proclamation may also be held to extend to and cover his
congratulations given to President Laurel for his declaration of war or
state of war against the United States of America and Great Britain,
his offer of services in any capacity and even to his contribution of
P10,000 intended according to his letter, for national defense although
according to his letter to Pio Duran, to "add to the strength of our
war efforts." Equally included in this political collaboration is his
membership in the KALIBAPI, even if his participation in that
organization was not as a mere indifferent or involuntary member as was
the case with many Filipinos, but as an active member and important
official who did all within his power and capacity to propagate the
idea of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and slander and
ridicule America and deprecate and assail its institutions and work in
these Islands. Also coming under political collaboration to be covered
by the Amnesty Proclamation is the appellant's organization of and
activities with the New Leaders' Association, even when the objectives
of said association as conceived and prepared by him, included
collaboration with the various Japanese organizations, pacification
efforts, and collaboration with the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy In
the safeguarding of its public works and communication facilities,
this, under a liberal interpretation and application of the Amnesty
Proclamation. Besides, in this respect there is no concrete evidence
that the appellant through the members of the New Leaders' Association
actually helped in the pacification campaign of the Japanese Armed
Forces or helped in guarding their transportation facilities.</p>
<p> The defendant's interview with a Japanese named Kobayashi under
count No. 19, will also be included in political collaboration to be
covered by the Amnesty Proclamation. So is his interview with Guerrilla
leader Leonardo Garcia as described in his diary, under count No. 10.</p>
<p> Appellant's preparation of the resolution congratulating the
Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron and its presentation to the Navy
Officials, may equally be classed under political collaboration and as
coming within the scope of the Amnesty Proclamation. The air unit of
said Navy must have appreciated and been encouraged by said resolution
and found comfort in the thought and knowledge that an association
composed of young, Intelligent, active and more or less influential
Filipinos, were, at least in spirit, on their side, and applauded their
war efforts and achievements. This might be regarded as psychological
aid and comfort. But by taking a liberal view of the case, we can as we
do hereby regard it as included in the Amnesty.</p>
<p> Acting upon this petition for dismissal, above referred to, we
hereby grant the same and consider dismissed those counts of the
information referring to economic and political collaboration as above
enumerated and discussed. Now, whether by reason of the application and
extension of the Amnesty Proclamation to appellant's acts of economic
and. political collaboration, his acts of adherence alone and proof
thereof have/been wiped out, or whether they may still be considered in
connection with the acts of military collaboration, <em>quære.</em> Anyway, there is no need of so considering them for there is more than sufficient proof of adherence in the other counts.</p>
<p align="center"> ADHERENCE</p>
<p> As to the other acts of appellant showing his adherence to the
enemy we find from the evidence, as was also found by the People's
Court that he used to speak by radio over the Radio Broadcasting
Station, the PIAM, then controlled by the enemy. On one occasion about
the middle of January, 1945, when the American Forces had already
landed in Lingayen, the appellant in a radio talk, hailed and praised
as heroes "the Makapilis fighting side by side with the Japanese in the
beaches of Pangasinan" and he urged the Filipinos to emulate and follow
their example. This may well be considered In connection with his
membership in the MAKAPILI, and not covered by the Amnesty Proclamation.</p>
<p>As proof of the esteem and regard in which the appellant was held by
the Japanese during the occupation, and as compensation or reward for
his services and collaboration, he was issued special passes by the
Japanese Manila Garrison Commanding Officer Hashimoto, In connection
with the propaganda of the Japanese Army, he had a special car and two
Japanese bodyguards, one of whom told him that he volunteered to be a
bodyguard to defend appellant's life as he considered appellant vital
not only to his country8s future but also to the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p> According to Rosendo Aterrado, the appellant proposed to Yoshida
the installation of a secret radio broadcasting station in his
(appellant's) house as a propaganda to win the confidence of the people
by exposing the abuses of the guerrillas as well as the Japanese
soldiers. According to witness Socorro Laguio, in January, 1945, the
defendant, carrying a revolver in his hand accompanied by three
Japanese civilians also armed, searched her house for rice, telling her
that if she had plenty of rice it can be taken away from her because
according to him the rice was exclusively for the use of the Japanese
Array, Alvero at the time wore short pants and blue denim shirt,
evidently, the uniform of the <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em>.</p>
<p> Let us now consider the assignment of errors made by the appellant.
Of the forty-two errors assigned we shall only discuss and pass upon
the important ones, and those necessary for the determination of this
case. Error No. 1 sets up the theory of suspended sovereignty. Error
No. 2 asserts that the treason law being political in character was
equally suspended during the enemy occupation, and error No. 3 is based
on the contention that due to the change in government from the
Commonwealth to Republic of the Philippines, treason against the former
is not now punishable. These same theories had already been advanced in
previous treason cases. They have been overruled and rejected by this
Court in the case of Laurel <em>vs</em>. Misa, (G. R. No. L-409, 44  Off.Gaz., 1176<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>) and reaffirmed in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Carlos, (44 Off. Gaz., 4281 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>). We therefore see no necessity in discussing.and determining this point or points again.</p>
<p> Under the 4th error assigned, the appellant claims that the
People's Court erred in considering adherence as constituting by itself
treason and of treating it as an independent, charge. The defendant
labors under a misapprehension. In its decision tlie People's Court
grouped the counts under three main classifications, namely: economic,
political, and military. Adherence was never considered as a count or
included in any of those three groups. It was merely added in the
latter part of the decision, not as a separate count but to show the
treasonous intent which impelled and characterized his overt acts of
treason.</p>
<p> Under error No. 25 appellant claims that the People's Court erred
in finding him as one of the organizers of the Makapili and that he
voluntarily 3Dined it, and in not holding that he was compelled to sign
the Articles of Association and the by-laws of the same, and that on
this point the two-witness rule was not complied with. We find that the
trial court did not commit the alleged error. The testimony of Jose I.
Baluyot as well as the testimony of the accused himself during the
trial and during the hearing of his petition for bail, and the entries
in his diary show that the accused was present at the meeting of
organization, acted as secretary of the same, took very active part in
its deliberations, presented five (5) of the seven (7) motions as shown
by his own. minutes of the first meeting, voluntarily signed the
Articles of Association and the By-laws of the association, occupied an
important department of the association, looked up the rooms which were
to be the headquarters of the organization, instructed the members of
the New Leaders' Association of which he was a co-founder and an
important official to be present at the inauguration of the Makapili,
helped in malting the chair arrangements and the work of ushering in
said inauguration and felt enthusiasm in translating the speech of
General Yamashita into Tagalog and exaltation over the power and/of his
own voice while making the translation.</p>
<p> Appellant also urges that the People's Court erred in holding that the <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em> was organized for treasonous activities or that it engaged in such treasonous activities. The very objectives of the <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em>.
its organization into a military unit with arras, uniforms, and
military discipline, its activities in taking over and guarding the
barracks and installations and equipment left by the Japanese Army in
the City of Manila and the offer made by the appellant of this <em>Bisigbakal</em>
organization to help in the maintenance of peace and order which at
that time included the suppression of the activities of the guerrillas
which was then regarded as subversive by the Japanese, abundantly show
that this organization which the appellant helped to found and to
organize, was of a military character intended to and actually used to
help the Japanese Armed Forces in their work of maintaining peace and
order, suppressing the resistance movement and defending the City of
Manila against the American Liberation Forces and their guerrilla
colleagues.</p>
<p> According to Rosendo Aterrado, on January 1, the appellant
announced a meeting of the New Leaders' Association that afternoon at
the Heacock building and at the meeting, he urged the members to join
the <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em> because it was the wish of the
Japanese Commander of the Manila Defense Corps that it help in the
maintenance of peace and order. Aterrado declined to join the <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em>
on the ground that he was unable to carry a gun and because he did not
like the prospect of shooting his own people; that in his opinion the
best way to maintain peace and order was to get food from the Japanese
Army and distribute it among the people so that they may not
participate in the fight between the Japanese and the Americans.
Because of this attitude and stand, Aterrado was summoned to a mock
court martial presided over by Alvero, with Yoshida at his right side,
and without any trial Aterrado was summarily and dishonorably
discharged.</p>
<p>Under his 32d assigned error, appellant maintains that the People's
Court erred in finding and holding that his desire and efforts to
maintain peace and order constituted treason and in support thereof, he
cites Art, 297 of the United States Rules of Land Warfare as regards
the right of a military occupant to demand and enforce from the
inhabitants of occupied territory such obedience as may be necessary
for the security of its forces, and for the maintenance of law and
order, citing Birkhimer on Military Government and Martial Law, It is
to be borne in mind however, that according to international law (Hague
Conventions of 1907, Art. 43), the duty to maintain peace and order is
imposed upon the military occupant and not upon the inhabitants of the
occupied territory. In the present case, the appellant through his <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em>
not only offered to assist but actually assisted in the maintenance of
peace and order through his military organization. In so doing, his
purpose according to himself was to relieve the Japanese Armed Forces
of the necessity of detailing and assigning a portion of their forces
for the maintenance of peace and order, so that they could concentrate
on defending the City of Manila against those trying to enter it, who
we all know were none other than the American Forces and their
guerrilla colleagues. Furthermore, as already stated, the maintenance
of peace and order at that time meant the suppression of the guerrillas
who were regarded as subversive elements because they were killing
Japanese soldiers and spies.</p>
<p> Under error No. 33 regarding the meeting at the City Hall in
January, 1945, he maintains that the trial court erred in holding that
that meeting was for a treasonous purpose or that the utterances made
therein by him constituted treason. Through the testimony of Leon
Guinto, then Mayor of Manila, he claims that nothing was said in that
meeting about the defense of Manila nor the suppression of guerrilla
activities, and that he (appellant) merely complained against the
confiscation of foodstuffs. Examining other portions of the testimony
of witness Leon Guinto, however, it will be found that previous to that
meeting the appellant accompanied by two Japanese civilians had already
gone to his office offering the services of his New Leaders'
Association to help distribute cloth to the people and to maintain
peace and order, and that Mayor Guinto had answered him that he already
had an adequate system for the distribution of cloth, but that he
(Guinto) had accepted the offer as to the maintenance of peace and
order. Furthermore, Guinto admitted that at the meeting at the City
Halls representatives of the Japanese Army and Navy and Military Police
were present. It is therefore more reasonable to accept the testimonies
of De la Fuente, Quintos, and Lugtu, who were also present at that
meeting who said that the appellant spoke on and urged the
intensification of the maintenance of peace and order and the urgency
of uniting all peace organizations for a more effective decimation or
suppression of the subversive elements which were the guerrillas.</p>
<p> In further support of his claim, appellant also pointed to the
testimony of Gerardo Cabo Chan to show that at that meeting he only
complained of the abuses of the Japanese sentries and soldiers. It
should be remembered however, that at that time Leon Guinto was a
treason indictee, and that consequently, he may not be regarded as an
absolutely impartial witness; and as to Gerardo Cabo Chan, his father
named Justo Cabo Chan was also present at that meeting, representing
the Chinese Community and that his presence and participation in that
meeting was one of the charges brought against him when he was arrested
by the CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps) for collaborating with the
enemy. Naturally, witness Gerardo Cabo Chan could not well be expected
as a witness to give or attach any treasonous color or intent to that
meeting for it may prejudice the case of his own father as a treason
suspect or indictee.</p>
<p> The 34th assigned error concerns count No. 11 which charges that
the appellant with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy and to
counteract the activities of the guerrillas and other pro-American
elements, proposed to Director General Yoshida of the New Leaders'
Association the organization of a military body to be known as the O.
P. O. G. (Our People's Own Guerrilla). The Peopled Court found the
defendant guilty on this count mainly on his admission as to his
preparation and. publication of the pamphlet LIBERTY (Exhibit T)
supposed official organ of the O. P. P. G., and his diary (Exhibit ZZ)
as well as the testimony of Rosendo Aterrado as to the statements made
by Alvero when he gave him a copy of the pamphlet. This admission by
the appellant may not be considered as the confession in open court
contemplated by the law on treason as a basis for conviction. It is
therefore believed that the requirement of the law as to sufficiency of
evidence to convict has not been filled; consequently, we uphold this
assignment of error and we rule that the People's Court erred in
convicting appellant on count No. 11. However, the evidence submitted
on this count is sufficient to prove adherence of the appellant to the
enemy.</p>
<p> Under the 38th assigned error, appellant maintains that the trial
court erred in considering as evidence against him a number of pages of
stenographic notes allegedly of his diary and. ignored his two real
diaries. From what we can gather from the record, appellant's theory
seems to be that he kept two diaries, one for the public eye and
consumption, including the Japanese, which diary did not reflect his
will and true sentiments; neither did it record correctly the events
therein narrated, so that even if examined by the Japanese he would not
be molested, much less, accused of being anti-Japanese, and that this
diary was Exhibit ZZ; and that there was another, real diary in his
handwriting for his private files, so that his private life would not
be exposed to the public view. But this supposed real diary was never
presented by him in court. If it were true as intimated by him that it
was included among the papers seized by the CIC (Counter Intelligence
Corps), then he should have proved in court the existence of said
alleged real diary; that it was in the possession of the prosecution
who refused to present it in evidence and thereby have the benefit of
the legal presumption, that evidence willfully suppressed by the
prosecution will be adverse to it if produced. On the other hand,
Exhibit ZZ could not possibly be the fake and false diary he claims,
supposedly intended for public consumption and to mislead the public
particularly the Japanese because it contains entries regarding his
private life, his relations with the opposite sex, and statements not
exactly pleasing to the Japanese such as that his brother Jesus Alvero
was pro-American and wanted to join the guerrillas. There is therefore
every reason to believe and to find that Exhibit ZZ is his real diary,
and that tne sentiments and events therein, noted and narrated were
entered in good faith and were more or less a faithful record of what
he felt and what had occurred at the time. </p>
<p> In this connection and inasmuch as this diary (Exhibit ZZ) has been
continually referred to and quoted not only by the People's Court but
also by this tribunal, it is deemed advisable to say a few words on its
admissibility and competence. Exhibit ZZ was duly identified by
Patricia Fermin, one of the secretaries of the appellant to whom it was
dictated by him and who (Patricia) later transcribed it. It was offered
and admitted in evidence without objections As a rule, diaries are
inadmissible because they are self-serving in nature, unless they have
the nature of books of account, (51 L. R. A. [N.S.], 813-815); but it
has also been held that an entry in a diary being in the nature of a
declaration if It was against interest when made, is admissible,
(Muller <em>vs</em>. Mclean, 31 Ohio Cir. Ct, Rep. 64 cited in Ann. Gas. 1916C, p. 718.)</p>
<p> Exhibits X and KK, alleged diaries dictated to Romana Bautista,
another secretary, are a little different. Exhibit X was objected to by
the defense on the ground that it was among the papers illegally seized
from appellant's house; and Exhibit KK was objected on the ground that
its authenticity was not properly established although in the course of
the hearing of the appellant's petition for bail he admitted the
correctness of his material statements in Exhibit X. However, inasmuch
as Romana Bautista who took down and transcribed Exhibits X and KK
refused to identify them during the trial, it is doubtful whether their
authenticity has been duly proven. Consequently, they are not
admissible.</p>
<p> Under his 42d and last assigned error appellant claims that the
People's Court erred in disregarding and not considering as evidence of
his intention and his explanation of his activities, the tangible and
valuable services which he rendered to Filipinos, friends and strangers
alike. He maintains that in aid of the resistance movement, among other
things he offered all his money and all that he could earn for the
unification of the guerrillas and he cites the testimonies of Colonel
Centenera and Major Ross. It appears, however, that his proposition to
Centenera on the basis of which he made the offer of aid was to set up
a guerrilla organization armed and supplied by the Japanese to
overthrow the Laurel government or Republic and set himself (Alvero) in
power, which government was to be later recognised by the Japanese,
This proposition was rejected by Centenera and Ross and several days
later, they were being sought by the Japanese Military Police, As to
his alleged offer of a radio transmitter, P30,000 in cash, radio
shortwave, foods, medicines, rifles, etc. to the resistance movement,
it was testified to only by his own brother Jesus Alvero for whose
natural bias, allowance should be made5 and Col. Barrion of the
resistance movement to whom they were allegedly delivered was never
presented in court to corroborate and fortify this claim.</p>
<p> Appellant's having saved the life of Buenejeres Cascante a
guerrilla, who was caught and was being investigated by the Japanese,
bears explanation. At that time, the guerrillas were gaining the
upperhand. In fact, the Americans and their guerrilla colleagues were
nearing Manila. It was but natural that the appellant should do
something for the guerrillas to gain their good-will and be in their
good graces, for his own safety later on. What happened was that
Cascante was taken to the appellant and the latter told the Japanese
that the prisoner was his man, whereupon Gascante was released. If at
all, the incident shows the great influence the appellant had with the
enemy, undoubtedly, for services rendered to them. And, as to his
assistance to the City population by distributing food at prices lower
than the black market and in some cases giving them free, as we have
already stated earlier, the distribution was part of the propaganda for
his New Leaders' Association, airl later of his <em>Bisigbakal</em>.
What is more, in making such distribution vie said that he had some
ulterior motive, as revealed by his trying, during such distribution of
commodities at the Legarda Elementary School building,to persuade the
population to resist the Americans and guerrilla forces that were
coming to the City of Maniia to liberate it. Moreover, the performance
of righteous actions, no matter how meritorious they may be is not a
justifying or exempting, not even a mitigating circumstance in the
commission of a wrong, Even service as a guerrilla does not exempt one
from criminal responsibility for treason (People <em>vs.</em> Victoria, 44 Off. Gaz., 2230 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> People <em>vs</em>. Garcia, 46 Off. Gaz., 2467 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>).</p>
<p> The last portion of appellant's brief, particularly the conclusions
which he himself prepared and signed, begins with a paragraph which
reads thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The decision appealed from tried to paint the
accused-appellant as an all-out traitor, a monster devoid of any good
or noble traits. The judge who wrote it, caught in the post-war
hysteria of his time, dipped his pen in the bloody wave of bias and
hatreds of that collaborator-bathing era and shutting his eyes to the
truth, produced a masterpiece of distortion equal only to the mind that
conceived it. So colored with prejudice was the point of view of the
judge, that he saw even in such good acts of the accused-appellant as
distributing food to the people, he saw even in such good acts the
taints of treason. No small shred of evidence capable of
misinterpretation escaped his genius in conjuring the horrible picture
of treason which he wanted portrayed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In conscience and in justice to Judge Jose S. Bautista who penned
the decision appealed from, we can not allow this personal attack to
pass unnoticed or uncensured. Said invective is uncalled for,
unwarranted as it is unfair. We have liberally quoted with favor
portions of the decision appealed from thereby showing our conformity
with and approval of said decision, learned and well written. We can
well appreciate and imagine the position of the appellant and his
natural reaction to a judgment of conviction but being a highly
intelligent and educated man and a lawyer at that, he should have been
more discreet and have had more self-control and not allowed himself to
be dominated and carried away by his feelings and expressed them in
such a passionate, ruthless and unfair manner, especially in a brief
filed before this Tribunal.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine a Filipino so completely sold on the Japanese,
their way of life, their ideals and their institutions, a Filipino so
utterly won over to the enemy, as Alvero. The entries in his diaries
make mention of his countless Japanese friends in high officialdom, not
only among the Japanese civilian entities attached to or collaborating
with the Japanese Armed Forces but also in the Army and the Navy
itself. His diary records almost daily conferences, interviews,
dinners, luncheons, rides, etc, with such Japanese officials. Some of
his conferences and parleys were by himself described as secret.</p>
<p> To fully understand the pro-Japanese leanings, sentiments and
adherence of the appellant to Japan, which later took the form of overt
acts of treason, it may be stated that far back in 1939, he went to
Japan, to attend the Japanese sponsored International Asiatic
Anti-Communistic Convention in Tokyo where he made known his friendship
with Japan through his poem "TOMADACHI TO NARO" meaning "let us be
friends", published, in the Japan Times on October 30, 1939 (Exh. OO).
This gesture met with a flattering reception from the Japanese,
particularly the press. Complimentary and favorable comment and
editorials were written as shown by defendant's own clippings from
these Japanese newspapers (Exhs. OO to OO-16). On his return from the
conference the appellant published a pamphlet entitled "WHO ARE THE
FRIENDS OF THE PHILIPPINES?" After answering that question he concludes
thus:</p>
<p> "Were there more neighbors like Japan, were there more guests like
the Japanese, there would be no need of territorial barriers and
divisions of nations and race, but on the contrary, there wo&amp;ld be
a universal nnion of men fighting towards the greatest ambition of the
world, the happiness of humanity." (Exhibit 00-2, p. 118, rec).</p>
<p>Evidence of. appellant's adherence to the enemy to be gathered not
only from his overt acts of treason but from many other acts during the
occupation as testified to by his own countrymen and from the entries
in his own diary, is abundant and overwhelming. Judge Dizon, one of the
three Judges of the People's Court who signed the decision of
conviction, in his concurring opinion has the following to say on the
adherence of the appellant:</p>
<p align="center"><em>"La Adhesion del Acusado al Enemigo.</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "La ponencia apunta con acierto difercintes actos
del acusado que no dejan duda algun en cuanto a su adhesion a la causa
del Japon dirimida y resuelta por las armas en la seguuda guerra
mundial. Su actividad febril e inusitada en el escsnario de la vida
publica duranto la ocupacion de nuestro pais por el Invasor—cuando la
mayoria de los de su sangre o se unian abiertamente al movimiento de
resistencia activa o procuraban pasar desapercibidos y porierse al mar
gen de los sucesos, huyendo de toda actividad que directa o remotamente
pudiera demostrar simpatia por el enemigo o constituir ayuda material,
moral o espiritual a sus esfuerzos de guerra—constituye, en mi opinion,
la prueba mas categorica y fehaciente de su adhesion a la causa del
Japon. En realidad, si nos fuera dable exprimir los autos, cual se hace
con una jugosa fruta. el liquido que destilarian seria no la adhesion
inocente e irreflexiva del automata sino la adhesion conscience,
deliberada y resuelta de un hombre sano y libre; el acusado que habia
puesto al servicio del Azote de su pais todo el idealismo y vigo de su
sangre joven, dignos, ciertamente, de mejor causa."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Regarding this same adherence, had appellant confined himself
within the realm of mere adherence—disloyal state mind and treasonous
thoughts, irtentions, and sympathies, however great may have been the
disappointment, disapproval, and even hatred of his countrymen for such
disloyalty to them and to their country, the law and prosecuting
officials could not have taken action against him. Adherence alone is
not indictable. In a free and democratic country like the Philippines,
there is freedom of thought and free and unhampered discussion and
expression of sentiment. But when he translated such treasonous
sympathies and Intentions into overt acts of treason such as joining
the Makapili, establishing his military organization <em>Bisig Bakal Ñg Tagala</em>
and offering its services to take charge of the maintenance of peace
and order, which included the suppression of the guerrillas, so that
the Japanese could concentrate their forces in defending the City of
Manila by fighting against the American and guerrilla forces trying to
enter and liberate it, then he (appellant) breached as it were the
walls of allegiance and loyalty which the treason law has erected to
surround and protect the security and integrity of the nation, and he
may then be held criminally liable.</p>
<p> In several cases already decided by this Court we have convicted
persons of treason for/membership In the Makapili organization, on the
theory that one joining such military body organized to actively help
the Japanese Armed Forces was "placing himself at, the enemy's call to
fight side by side with him when the opportune time came altho an
opportunity never presented itself, because such membership by its very
nature gave the enemy aid and comfort." (People <em>vs. </em>Adriano, 44 Off.Gaz. 4300 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>; People <em>vs</em>. Alitagtag, 45 Off.Gaz., 715 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>).
Here, the appellant not only joined the Makapill as a member but
greatly helped organize and later inaugurate it. He was assigned the
high and important post of Colonel in it. Later, in a radio speech he
hailed as heroes to be emulated the Makapilis who, side by side with
the Japanese were fighting the American landing forces in Lingayen.
That appellant Alvero is guilty of the charge of treason, is clear.</p>
<p> In conclusion we find, the appellant guilty of treason. Although we agree to the prison sentence of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
meted out by the People's Court, all the members of this high tribunal
talcing part believe that the fine should be increased. We hereby
increase it from P10,000.00 to P20,000.00. With this modification as to
the sentence and as to those portions of the decision of the People's
Court discussed and ruled upon by us5 the said decision appealed from
is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
