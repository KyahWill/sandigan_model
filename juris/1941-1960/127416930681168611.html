<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> By resolution of April 16, 1953, the parties hereto were required or 
permitted to state within ten days from notice their reasons, if any, why this 
litigation should not be declared moot. So far, no one submitted any 
comment.<p></p>
<p>Briefly outlined, the case arose from a suit pending before Hon. Luis B. 
Reyes, Judge of the Manila Court of First Instance (Civil Case No. 31042) 
wherein Far East International Import and Export Corporation sued Henderson 
Trippe Shipping Co. Inc., et al., to compel the fatter to sign and deliver to it 
the bills of lading for plaintiff's scrap iron loaded aboard defendants' S. S. 
Liberal, which had left the Port of Manila for Japan, and to recover 
damages.</p>
<p>Besides other defenses, the answer explained that no bills had been issued 
because Far East International Import and Export Corporation had failed to pay 
the freight, demurrage and other charges for which it was 
accountable.<br><br>Soon thereafter, in an urgent petition, Far East represented 
to the Court that the scrap iron shipment had arrived in Japan, that for lack of 
bills of lading, it was impounded in a bonded warehouse and will probably be 
sold at public auction in Osaka, Japan, unless the bills of lading were promptly 
issued to plaintiff, which Would furnish a bond to answer for defendants' 
freightage and other charges. Far East therefore prayed that upon submission of 
a bond in the amount fixed by the Court, the defendant Henderson Trippe be 
directed and authorized to sign and issue the aforesaid shipping documents. Over 
the defendants' objection, the petition was granted in an order dated December 
24, 1956, fixing a bond in the amount of P50,000.00.</p>
<p>After denial of their motion to reconsider, petitioners commenced here the 
instant proceedings for <i>certiorari</i>, to annul the aforesaid order and for 
preliminary injunction to restrain its enforcement in the meantime.</p>
<p>Our resolution of January 7, 1957, requiring respondents to answer, 
authorized the issuance of a preliminary injunction "upon petitioners' filing a 
bond of P10,000.00." However, such bond was never filed, and the injunction never issued. There is 
no reason to believe that the lower court's order to deliver the bills of lading 
has not been carried out.
</p><p>On the other hand, on January 18, 1957, respondents informed this Court that 
the scrap iron subject-matter of the litigation, then on deposit in an Osaka 
warehouse, was scheduled to be sold at public auction on the same day, and 
petitioned this Court to suspend such auction sale until further orders; but 
this Court denied the request upon the obvious ground that it 'had no power to 
enforce the requested directive in a foreign country. Again, there is no reason 
to believe that the sale has not been carried out as scheduled.</p>
<p>So, as the main object of the instant litigation was to avoid delivery to the 
Far East of the bills of lading, and the urgency or importance of such delivery 
has disappeared with the sale of the scrap iron, it may now be considered moot 
or academic,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> the parties having the 
opportunity to ventilate, in Civil Case No. 31042 of the Manila Court of First 
Instance, the remaining question of damages, if any, arising from the issuance 
of the disputed order. </p>
<p>Case dismissed. No costs.</p>
