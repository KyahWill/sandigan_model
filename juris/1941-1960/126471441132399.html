				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Plaintiff filed a  complaint before the  Court  of First Instance  of Laguna for the purpose  of having certain document declared  as  an equitable mortgage and praying that the consignation he has made of the  sum of P4,35002 with  the clerk of  court  be approved and defendants  be ordered to execute  a deed of release of said mortgage, to pay the plaintiff the sum of P14,779.98  representing excess  interest,  to pay  P6,000 as  damages  and P5,000  as attorneys' fees,  plus the costs of action.</p>
<p>Defendants answered  denying the  genuineness and due execution  of the aforesaid  document and setting  up  as a defense that said document is a promise to sell or  an option contract; that they had already acquired the property subject matter of the mortgage through  acquisitive prescription, and that  the action  is already barred  by the statute of limitation.</p>
<p>Parties  adduced  evidence  at the trial  in  addition to a stipulation of facts they had submitted,  and  thereupon, the lower court rendered judgment, the dispositive  part of which  reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(<em>a</em>) Declaring that the contract entered into between the plaintiff  and the deceased Marcelmo Arjona,  predecessor-in-interest of the  defendants, was  one  of  loan;  that  the document Exhibit  'A' is merely an equitable mortgage or antichresis designed to  guarantee  the payment  of the said loan of P4,350.02  contracted by  the plaintiff from the  deceased  Marcelino  Arjona;</p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>)  Ordering the defendants to receive from  the Clerk of Court the  amount of P4,350.02 deposited by  plaintiff  as payment of  the repurchase price of the five parcels  of land  in  question,  and to execute upon receiving the  said amount  the  corresponding deed reconveying the aforesaid property to the plaintiff, together with the possession of the aforementioned five parcels of land;</p>
  <p>(<em>c</em>) Declaring that the interest on the  lean is considered paid by the fruits of  the land received by the deceased Marcelino Arjona and  his  successors-in-interest,  and  dismissing plaintiff's  second cause of action;</p>
  <p>(<em>d</em>) Dismissing plaintiff's  third  cause  of action;</p>
  <p>(<em>e</em>) Dismissing defendant's counter-claim  against  the  plaintiff; with special pronouncement as to costs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this decision,  both parties  have appealed, plaintiff from that portion which declares that the interest of the loan  should be considered compensated  by the fruits of the land received by defendants and dismisses his claim for attorney's fees and defendants from that portion which declares the document in question as an  equitable mortgage or antichresis, but the appeals were taken separately. The appeal of plaintiff was taken to the Court of Appeals which was later  certified to this Court as  falling under section 17(5) of the Judiciary Act  of 1948; whereas  the appeal of defendants  was taken directly to the Supreme Court.  It should  be  here  mentioned  that  pending consideration of the  present  case, the decision on the appeal of defendants was promulgated affirming in  toto the decision of the lower  court in so far as  it finds that the document Exhibit A is an equitable mortgage or antichresis and not merely a promise to sell as contended by defendants (G.  R.  No. L-7279,  promulgated October 29, 1955).</p>
<p>The mortgage in question covers five  lots situated in Liliw,  Laguna, which were formally  covered by Tax Declaration  Nos. 16502, 16564, 14646,  16572, and  16563,  all in the name  of plaintiff.   To satisfy a judgment rendered against him  in Civil Case No. 2447  of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, said lots were sold at public auction to the plaintiff in  said case in whose favor the corresponding certificate of  sale  was executed  by the  provincial sheriff on December 14,  1929,   On  November 20, 1930, Francisco Arjona redeemed four of said lots and Marcelino Arjona redeemed  the  fifth lot  upon  the request of Felix Garcia, who  promised to reimburse  later on the amounts paid by the Arjonas.</p>
<p>In 1932, the first four lots were redeemed from  Francisco Arjona with money borrowed by Felix Garcia from Marcelino Arjona with the understanding that the refund of said sums would be guaranteed by a mortgage on the properties  above-mentioned.  Hence,  on March  3,  1932, Felix  Garcia  and  Marcelino Arjona  executed the  deed Exhibit A.  Upon the execution of this deed, Felix Garcia who, despite the auction sale in 1929 and the  redemption by the Arjonas in 1930, had  remained  in possession of the properties in question, delivered the same  to Marcelino  Arjona,  in whose name new tax declarations were issued subsequently.  Upon the death  of Marcelino Arjona on  February 8,  1941,  the  properties  were  placed  under the administration of the  judicial administrator of his estate, his  brother Engracio Arjona.   In 1951, the  latter asked  Felix Garcia to redeem the  properties for  P10,000, but before any definite agreement could be  reached,  Engracio Arjona  died.  On February 6, 1952,  Felix Garcia offered to redeem the properties, but the widow  and the children of  Marcelino  Arjona, who succeeded in the possession thereof, rejected the offer.   So Felix Garcia made a judicial consignation of  the sum of P4,350.02  and instituted the present action.</p>
<p>It is contended by appellant that the lower court erred in denying his  claim for the refund of the excess interest received by defendants in the form of fruits they  and their predecessors-in-interest had enjoyed from the properties  in question  from  1932 up  to  and  including  1952 notwithstanding  the fact  that  he has adduced  sufficient evidence to substantiate said claim.   Evidently, appellant refers to the portion of the decision of the  trial court which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The evidence  adduced by the plaintiff  concerning  the fruits of the  land  in question  from the year 1932 up  to the present does not appear to  be based on a personal knowledge of the actual produce of the  land but on mere assumption that such kind of land should  yield so  much coconut fruits  during  a  given period of time, and so  much cavanes of palay per harvest.  Such eviddence does not furnish an  adequate and reliable basis for making a correct estimate of  the annual yield of the land.  Likewise, the evidence with respect to the prices are too indefinite, vague  and loose  to serve  as  basis for ascertaining the actual market value of the fruits at the time of each and every harvest."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have examined the  evidence adduced  by appellant concerning the fruits  supposedly en5oyed  by defendants and their predecessors-in-interest and  have found that  the same merely  consists  in  tax  declarations  covering  the five lots in question  (Exhibits E,  E-l,  F,  F-l, G, G-l, G-2, H, H-l, I  and 1-1),  the  testimony of Felix Garcia, herein appellant, and of one Macario Monfero who claims to have been an agent  of  the  deceased Marcelino Arjona in the sale of coconuts and the  general buyer of a coconut  factory  which  was engaged in the wholesale buying of coconuts in Laguna  and neighboring  provinces.  It is contended  that  said  tax  declarations reveal that there are  1,969 fruit-bearing coconut trees  planted on the lots and that some portions thereof are devoted  to rice farming  with a  total seedling capacity of one  and  one-half cavans  which, according to Felix Garcia, has an average annual  yield  of  sixty cavans.   It is  also contended that said  exhibits show  that the 1,969 coconut  trees  have  an average annual yield of 75,893 coconuts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Macario Monfero testified that the price of coconuts per thousand ranged from P5 in 1933 to P50 in  1941, from P18 in  1942 to P10,000 in 1945, and  from P100 in  1946 to  between P18 and P25 in 1952. Taking the amount of  P27.50  per thousand coconuts  as the average  price during  the period  from  1932 to 1952, appellant  concludes that defendants  shall  have received every year the sum of P2,087.06 as the value of P75,893 coconuts which represent  the average annual produce of the lots, or a total  of P41,741.20  for the period of twenty years during  which they were  in possession of the property.  Granting  defendants a  generous  reduction  of  50 per cent to cover expenses of maintenance, handling and shares of tenants, it would leave a balance of P20,870.60, and deducting from this amount the interest of the principal  obligation  amounting  to  P5,220,  the balance  is P15,650.60 which, it is claimed, represents the excess interest to which appellant is entitled.</p>
<p>Apparently, the  above picture  is impressive and  may serve as  basis for determining the benefits derived by defendants from  the lots in question,  but a more careful scrutiny thereof  would reveal that  the same  contains many flaws.  In the first place, the testimony of Monfero as to the price of coconuts from  1932 to 1952 cannot be relied  upon for it  is merely  based  upon memory  and is not supported by any document.  One would really  need a very  extraordinary memory to remember. prices  during so long a time, and besides his testimony does not  appear corroborated.  And in the second place, there is no actual or positive evidence showing the number of coconuts that had been actually produced, gathered and sold by defendants during the period above-mentioned.</p>
<p>It is true that the tax declarations submitted  by appellant show the actual number  of coconut trees standing on the lands as  well as  the calculated annual yield of coconuts that  the  trees may bear  during  said period, but such evidence is  far from being satisfactory because it fails to take into  account certain  factors which  may prevent production and enjoyment, for it  cannot be denied that there may  be years where no  transaction can be made  either because  of faulty yield, sickness, lack  of buyers  and the like.   In short,  as  the  lower court well said,  "Such evidence does not  furnish  an adequate and reliable basis for making a correct estimate of the  annual yield  of the land."  For this reason, we are persuaded to uphold the finding of the  lower court which we consider to be the most fair and equitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>As regards the  claim for  attorney's  fees,  as there is no  stipulation to that effect,  and no bad faith is shown on  the part of appellees, the same does not come  under Article 2208 of the New  Civil Code.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the decision appealed from, in so far as the claim  of appellant is concerned, is  affirmed, with  costs against appellants.</p>
