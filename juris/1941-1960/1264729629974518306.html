				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Rev,&nbsp; Fr.&nbsp; Martin&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Alcazar was the&nbsp; original owner of 2 parcels of land: one&nbsp; located&nbsp; at Earlis,&nbsp; Pilar, Sorsogon, containing&nbsp; an area&nbsp; of 34.8471&nbsp; hectares,&nbsp; and the other at Burabon, Loreto, Castilla,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the same&nbsp; province, with an area of 440.3326 hectares (Exh.&nbsp; 1).&nbsp; In&nbsp; an absolute deed of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; dated <i>February 17,&nbsp; 1953</i>, Fr.&nbsp; Alcazar appeared to have sold&nbsp; the aforementioned&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of land together with a.&nbsp; house of strong materials&nbsp; erected on the Land of Frank&nbsp; Hoeizi at&nbsp; Putiao, Pilar, Sorsogon,&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva&nbsp; Caceres in&nbsp; consideration of the sum of P12,000.00.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was specifically&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for in said instrument that as the said parcels&nbsp; of land were not yet brought under the Torrens system, although at the time of the&nbsp; transaction the proceeding for the&nbsp; registration of the same was still pending (GLRO No. 2, Rec. No. N-728), the deed of&nbsp; sale should be&nbsp; registered&nbsp; under&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 3344.&nbsp; <i>On July 14, 1953,</i> Original Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 0-32 covering&nbsp; the parcels of land above-mentioned was actually issued&nbsp; in the name of&nbsp; Fr.&nbsp; Martin&nbsp; S. Alcazar.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not appear from the record&nbsp; that the deed of sale&nbsp; (Exh. 1)&nbsp; was ever registered under the provisions of Act 3344 as agreed upon.<br><br>On <i>January 17,&nbsp; 1954,</i> after the demise of Fr.&nbsp; Martin Alcazar, the deed of sale (Exh.&nbsp; 1) was presented to the Register of Deeds&nbsp; of Sorsogon for registration, together with an instrument&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Monsignor&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; P. Santos&nbsp; ceding all the property rights and interests that he had&nbsp; as&nbsp; the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Nueva Caceres over the properties subject of the&nbsp; sale in favor of the Roman Catholic.&nbsp; Bishop&nbsp; of Legaspi, with Mons. Flaviano B.&nbsp; Ariola as&nbsp; incumbent&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; D).&nbsp; As a consequence thereof, O.C.T. No. 0-32 was cancelled and Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of&nbsp; Title&nbsp; No. 656&nbsp; was issued to Mons. Pedro&nbsp; P. Santos, but said&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; was&nbsp; likewise&nbsp; cancelled on the same day and Transfer Certificate of&nbsp; Title No.&nbsp; 657 was issued&nbsp; in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of Mons. Flaviano&nbsp; B. Ariola&nbsp; in&nbsp; virtue of&nbsp; the&nbsp; cession&nbsp; of rights executed&nbsp; by Mons.&nbsp; Santos in favor of the Roman Catholic&nbsp; Bishop of Legaspi.<br><br>On <i>April 20, 1954</i>,&nbsp; Concepcicm H. Luna,&nbsp; Alfredo&nbsp; Hoeizi, Carmen A. Hoeizi,&nbsp; Elizabeth A. Hoeizi, Ignacio A. Luna, Juan Alcazar, Reynalda Alcazar, Gloria&nbsp; Amparo Huab, Francisca H.&nbsp; Javier,&nbsp; Angela A. Buencamino, Lourdes Alcazar Dellosa,&nbsp; Irineo Dellosa, Ruperto&nbsp; Alcazar, Jr.,&nbsp; Jose Alcazar, Rigoberto&nbsp; Alcazar,&nbsp; Purita Alcazar, Thelma Alcazar, Lorencita A. de Vera&nbsp; and Delfin de Vera, nephews and&nbsp; nieces and alleged heirs of the&nbsp; late Fr. Martin Alcazar filed a&nbsp; petition with&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Sorsogon, which was docketed as <i>Special Action No. 879</i>, contending that&nbsp; the cancellation of O.C.T.&nbsp; No. 0-32 and&nbsp; the subsequent issuance of T.C.T.&nbsp; Nos.&nbsp; 656 and 657 were illegal&nbsp; because the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; right of&nbsp; Mons. Pedro P. Santos&nbsp; was deemed abandoned upon&nbsp; the issuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; original certificate of title in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Fr. Alcazar&nbsp; without the said&nbsp; deed of sale being annotated therein,&nbsp; and consequently, the transfer of said right in favor of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Legaspi was equally null and void.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; they prayed the&nbsp; Court to order&nbsp; Mons. Flaviano B. Ariola to surrender T. C. T. No. 657 to the Register of Deeds&nbsp; of Sorsogon; to&nbsp; order said Register of Deeds to cancel the game and&nbsp; issue a new certificate of title in substitution of the Original Certificate of Title No. 0-32 in the name of the late Fr.&nbsp; Alcazar,&nbsp; and for such other&nbsp; relief as may&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; proper in&nbsp; the premises.<br><br>In his answer, Mons.&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; P. Santos&nbsp; averred that although.the deed of sale was executed&nbsp; during the pendency of&nbsp; the proceedings for the&nbsp; registration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; 2 parcels of land, they did not&nbsp; cause&nbsp; the proper substitution of applicants therein&nbsp; to avoid&nbsp; the trouble&nbsp; of amending the application; that the expenses for&nbsp; said registration were borne by&nbsp; Mons. Santos;&nbsp; that&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners knew&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; procedure followed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; cancellation of O. C. T, No. 0-82 was legal,&nbsp; the filing of said petition was malicious.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mons. Santos thereby prayed the court for the dismissal of the&nbsp; same and claimed P10,000.00 for moral&nbsp; damages,&nbsp; for attorney's&nbsp; fees and for&nbsp; such&nbsp; other relief as may be deemed just&nbsp; and equitable under the circumstances.<br><br>Monsignor&nbsp; Flaviano&nbsp; Ariola in&nbsp; his separate&nbsp; answer, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; later&nbsp; amended to include&nbsp; a&nbsp; counterclaim for moral&nbsp; damages in&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P100,000.00, alleged that in view of the fact&nbsp; that the deceased&nbsp; left&nbsp; debts,&nbsp; petitioners had&nbsp; no&nbsp; capacity&nbsp; to sue since&nbsp; the rights&nbsp; and interests of a decedent could only be asserted by a judicially appointed administrator&nbsp; if the deceased died with&nbsp; assets in the possession&nbsp; of third parties.&nbsp; It was prayed by this respondent that the petition be correspondingly dismissed.<br><br>Petitioners, in their reply to the&nbsp; answer of Mons. Santos, advanced the argument that the deed of sale was without consideration because neither Mons.&nbsp; Santos nor&nbsp; the Diocese of Nueva&nbsp; Caceres paid for the value stated there in ; that actually Fr, Alcazar intended to donate said&nbsp; properties to&nbsp; the congregation of the&nbsp; Redemptorist Fathers of Manila, but as&nbsp; this religious association was composed of foreigners, they simulated this deed of sale to go around the prohibition of the law.&nbsp; They also disputed the Archbishop's right to moral damages, and in addition&nbsp; to their prayer contained&nbsp; in&nbsp; the petition,&nbsp; they asked the court to declare the deed of sale (Exh. 1)&nbsp; null and void.<br><br>On August 31, 1955, the court rendered&nbsp; judgment holding that the sale&nbsp; of the properties&nbsp; in controversy was valid based on the findings that although Mons.&nbsp; Santos admitted having paid only&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P2,200.00, which payment&nbsp; was annotated in&nbsp; the notebook of Fr.&nbsp; Alcazar, the vendor left the balance of P9,800.00 in his&nbsp; care&nbsp; for the purpose of adding the same to the original P50,000.00 which the late Fr. Alcazar also entrusted to the Monsignor for the&nbsp; purpose of establishing&nbsp; a&nbsp; mission house&nbsp; in&nbsp; the' diocese of Nueva&nbsp; Caceres; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; amount was&nbsp; not intended by the deceased for the use&nbsp; of the Redemptorist Fathers&nbsp; as the selection&nbsp; of the proper congregation&nbsp; or order to establish the&nbsp; mission was left at the discretion of Mons. Santos;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; it was the&nbsp; Archbishop&nbsp; himself who made arrangements&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Redemptorist Fathers to carry on this purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court thus ruled that&nbsp; the cancellation of&nbsp; O.C.T. No. O-S2 and the&nbsp; subsequent issuance of the transfer certificates&nbsp; of title were&nbsp; proper. It dismissed,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; respondents'&nbsp; counterclaims&nbsp; for moral&nbsp; damages on the ground that&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of said petition was not given such publicity&nbsp; as to discredit said church dignitaries, aside from&nbsp; the fact that no proof was presented that the&nbsp; petition was filed in bad faith or with malicious intent.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this decision, petitioners brought this matter on appeal to this Court, and the interrelated issues&nbsp; assigned&nbsp; in&nbsp; this appeal&nbsp; could&nbsp; be boiled down to the sole question of whether the lower court had jurisdiction to declare the deed of&nbsp; sale executed by Fr.&nbsp; Martin Alcazar in favor of the Roman&nbsp; Catholic Bishop of&nbsp; Nueva Caceres as&nbsp; valid, and consequently&nbsp; whether the Register of Deeds of Sorsogon&nbsp; acted properly in cancelling&nbsp; O.C.T. No. 0-32 and issuing T.C.T. Nos. 656 and 657.<br><br>In trying to&nbsp; assail the jurisdiction of the lower court, appellants start on the premise that the&nbsp; petition for the cancellation of T.C.T. No. 657 issued in the name of Mons. Ariola was pursuant to the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of Section 112 of the Land&nbsp; Registration Act and filed with the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Sorsogon in its capacity as a Land Registration Court.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; they&nbsp; argued,&nbsp; it being a court of limited jurisdiction,&nbsp; it cannot take cognizance of the ques- tion of the validity or invalidity&nbsp; of a document&nbsp; for&nbsp; it has to be resolved&nbsp; by a&nbsp; court exercising&nbsp; general jurisdiction. Appellants, however, forget that they&nbsp; were the ones who&nbsp; raised the legality&nbsp; of the transfers&nbsp; of' the certificates on the basis of&nbsp; said instrument&nbsp; (Exh,&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; and even&nbsp; if said question&nbsp; had&nbsp; to be resolved&nbsp; by&nbsp; the lower Court as a Land Registration Court, under the principle laid down&nbsp; by Us in the case of Government of the P. I. vs. Serafica,&nbsp; 61 Phil. 93,&nbsp; and&nbsp; reiterated in&nbsp; the case of Caoibes vs. Sison&nbsp; (<i>supra</i>, p.&nbsp; 19).&nbsp; We find no reason to declare that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Land Registration&nbsp; Courts,&nbsp; that are at the same&nbsp; time Courts&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance and of&nbsp; general jurisdiction could&nbsp; not have,&nbsp; at least&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sake&nbsp; of ex- pediency, entertained and disposed of the question&nbsp; of the validity or invalidity of the instrument referred to above<br><br>On&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; Section 112 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Land Registration Act&nbsp; (No. 496)&nbsp; relied&nbsp; upon by appellants, reads&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 112. No&nbsp; erasure,&nbsp; alteration or amendment shall be&nbsp; made upon the registration book after the entry of&nbsp; a&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of title or of a memorandum thereon and the attestation of the same by tho clerk&nbsp; or any register of deeds, except by order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court. Any registered owner or other person in interest may at any time apply&nbsp; by&nbsp; petition to the court, upon the ground that&nbsp; registered interests of any descriptions whether vested, contingent, expectant or inchoate, have terminated and ceased;&nbsp; or that&nbsp; new interests have arisen or been created which do not appear upon the certificate; or&nbsp; that any&nbsp; error omission,&nbsp; or mistake was made in entering&nbsp; a&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; or any&nbsp; memorandum thereon, or&nbsp; on any duplicate&nbsp; certificate; or that the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of any person on the certificate has been changed;&nbsp; or that the registered owner has been married; or if registered as&nbsp; married, that the marriage has been terminated; or that a corporation which owned registered land and has been dissolved has&nbsp; not conveyed the&nbsp; same within three years after its dissolution; or upon any&nbsp; other reasonable ground; and the court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition after notice to all parties in interest, and may order&nbsp; the entry of a new certificate, or entry or cancellation of&nbsp; a memorandum upon a&nbsp; certificate, or grant any&nbsp; other relief upon such terms and conditions,&nbsp; requiring security if&nbsp; necessary,&nbsp; as&nbsp; it may&nbsp; deem proper:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *Any petition filed under this section and all&nbsp; petitions&nbsp; and motions filed under&nbsp; the provisions of this Act after the original registration&nbsp; <i>shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; filed and entitled&nbsp; in the original&nbsp; case 'in which the decree of registration was entered</i>. </blockquote>Contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; appellants' line&nbsp; of&nbsp; argument that the petition was filed with&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; Court as a land registration court, We cannot fail&nbsp; to&nbsp; notice that&nbsp; said&nbsp; petition mentions&nbsp; the nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; the proceeding&nbsp; and&nbsp; carries the docket-number&nbsp; as <i>Special Action No. 879</i>&nbsp; and not&nbsp; of the original land&nbsp; registration proceedings&nbsp;&nbsp; (G.L.R.O.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2, Rec. No. N-728) as exhorted by&nbsp; the the last paragraph&nbsp; of Section&nbsp; 112&nbsp; of Act&nbsp; 496.&nbsp; Appellants contend that this was merely&nbsp; an&nbsp; error&nbsp; committed by the Clerk&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon who gave it&nbsp; a new number instead&nbsp; of filing the same under the&nbsp; original case. Appellants, however, did&nbsp; not&nbsp; furnish Us with a&nbsp; certified copy of the&nbsp; original&nbsp; petition in order&nbsp; to establish&nbsp; how was the caption thereof,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; have they reproduced it&nbsp; in the&nbsp; record on appeal&nbsp; to substantiate&nbsp; their&nbsp; contention that it was&nbsp; a&nbsp; mistake&nbsp; on&nbsp; the part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clerk of&nbsp; Court <i>a&nbsp; quo</i>, to open&nbsp; a new case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the&nbsp; circumstances of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar, We&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; countenance this excuse because in the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of evidence and without the&nbsp; Clerk of Court being called&nbsp; to testify&nbsp; in support of their&nbsp; point, the&nbsp; docket number given&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case by said Clerk must be considered as conclusive proof that said number&nbsp; corresponds to the action instituted by appellants and no&nbsp; other, the intention of the parties to the contrary notwithstanding.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; subsequent acts of appellants and their theory during the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; likewise belie their contention&nbsp; and strengthen our belief that the case was&nbsp; actually instituted as an independent civil action.&nbsp; In the proceedings had in the lower&nbsp; Court, appellants vigorously asserted that the sale was void&nbsp; for being&nbsp; without consideration, stressing and hammering the point that it was merely&nbsp; a simulated sale designed to camouflage&nbsp; the true&nbsp; intent of&nbsp; the decedent, i.e.,&nbsp; to&nbsp; donate said&nbsp; properties to&nbsp; the Redemptorist Fathers&nbsp; in order&nbsp; to enable&nbsp; and finance the establishment of&nbsp; a&nbsp; mission&nbsp; in the diocese of&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Caceres under&nbsp; the management&nbsp; of said&nbsp; religious organization. With the records of the&nbsp; case, it is&nbsp; indeed clear to Us that appellants sought the intervention of the Court in the exercise&nbsp; of its general jurisdiction, probably having in mind the fact that as they&nbsp; were impugning&nbsp; the intrinsic validity of the deed of sale&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; 1) such matter had to be threshed out in an ordinary civil action, which procedure&nbsp; is also&nbsp; proper, following our&nbsp; ruling in&nbsp; the case of Garcia vs. Belzunce,&nbsp; (84 Phil.,&nbsp; 802, 47&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 1820). Having arrived at such conclusion, there can&nbsp; be no question that&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Sorsogon, as a court of general jurisdiction, had&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; pass upon the validity of the&nbsp; instrument&nbsp; in controversy and We find no reason to reverse the lower court's ruling that the act of the Register of Deeds in cancelling O.C.T. No. 0—32 and issuing T.C.T.&nbsp; Nos. 656 and 657 is proper. Anent respondents' appeal from the ruling of the Court dismissing their counterclaim for moral&nbsp; damages, We likewise find no&nbsp; basis for a reversal of the same.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision dated&nbsp; August&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; appealed from is hereby affirmed, with cost against appellants. It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo</i>, and <i>Labrador, JJ</i>., concur. <i>Montemayor, JJ.</i>, concurs in&nbsp; the result.</div>
