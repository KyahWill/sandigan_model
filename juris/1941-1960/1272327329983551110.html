				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-5424, October 24, 1952</h4>
				<H3>THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. QUERUBE C. MAKALINTAL, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ILOILO, AND UY CHIONG, AS AN INTERESTED PARTY, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari seeking to set aside the 
order of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dated January 3, 1952, which 
sets the case for hearing so that Uy Chiong may present the additional evidence 
required by Republic Act No. 530. The writ of preliminary injunction request was 
granted. 
<p align="justify">This case stems from the petition for naturalization filed by 
Uy Chiong in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo on May 13, 1948. That case 
was decided favorably on January 21, 1949, the court ordering that Uy Chiong be 
granted certificate of naturalization. From this decision the Government 
appealed.</p>
<p align="justify">On July 23, 1951, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision. On 
December 13, 1951, or barely five months after the decision of the latter court 
became final, Uy Chiong filed a petition in the court of origin asking that he 
be allowed to present evidence to show that he has complied with the additional 
requirements of Republic Act No. 530 alleging that the period of two years 
prescribed therein had already elapsed. To this petition the Government filed an 
opposition contending that the petition was premature. This opposition was 
overruled and on January 3, 1952, the court set a date for the reception of the 
additional evidence. Hence this petition for certiorari. </p>
<p align="justify">The only issue to be determined in this case hinges on the 
interpretation of the word promulgation employed in section 1, of Republic Act 
No. 530. </p>
<p align="justify">Said section 1 reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SECTION 1. The provisions of existing laws notwithstanding, no 
petition for Philippine citizenship shall be heard by the courts until after six 
months from the publication of the application required by law, nor shall any 
decision granting the application become executory until after two years from 
its promulgation and after the court, on proper hearing, with the attendance of 
the Solicitor General or his representative, is satisfied, and so finds, that 
during the intervening time the applicant has (1) not left the Philippines, (2) 
has dedicated himself continuously to a lawful calling or profession, (3) has 
not been convicted of any offense or violation of Government promulgated rules, 
(4) or committed any act prejudicial to the interest of the nation or contrary 
to any Government announced policies." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It appears from the above legal provision that no decision 
granting the application for naturalization can become executory until after two 
years from its promulgation. We take it that the word <span style="font-style: italic;">executory</span> has been used in 
the law advisedly. The use of said word is very significant. Its real import 
cannot be mistaken. It can only mean that no decision can be executed until 
after two years from the date said decision has become final. When, therefore, 
the law says that a decision cannot be executed until after two years from its 
promulgation, it can only refer to the decision of the Supreme Court if the case 
has been appealed. Of course, when the case is decided in favor of the applicant 
and the Government does not appeal, that decision should be reckoned with in the 
computation of the period of two years contemplated by law. And this is so 
because when a case is appealed, the decision may be changed, modified or 
reversed in its entirety, which means that during the pendency of the appeal the 
original decision has no legal force and effect. The decision of this court, in 
case of appeal, is the law of the case (Posas vs. Toledo Transportation Co., 
Inc., 58 Phil., 390). This decision has no retroactive effect.</p>
<p align="justify">We believe that the above interpretation is the most logical 
and consistent in the light of the incendment of the law. It should be noted 
that Republic Act No. 530 is but an amendment to our naturalization law. The 
purpose of this amendment is undoubtedly to give to the Government a two-year 
period more within which to test the sincerity of an applicant to become a 
Philippine citizen. This purpose would certainly be defeated were we to hold 
that the decision of this court should be given a retroactive effect whenever it 
is confirmatory of the decision of the lower court. </p>
<p align="justify">This court had already occasion to act on a similar case 
recently wherein it reached the same conclusion (Chua-sintek vs. Barcelona, G. 
R. No. L-5124, October 8, 1951). In that ease, the applicant obtained a 
favorable decision on November 12, 1948, which was affirmed on appeal on May 18, 
1951, but on July 7, 1951, he moved that he be allowed to prove the additional 
requirements of the law because the two-year period counted from the original 
decision had already elapsed. The court denied the petition saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"After a careful study of the aforesaid legal question, it is 
the considered opinion of this court that the period of two years provided for 
in the above quoted section 1 of Republic Act No. 530 should be computed from 
the promulgation of the decision of the Supreme Court on May 18, 1951, 
confirming the decision of this Court, because from the time the appeal was 
taken from the said decision of this court, the same was without force and 
effect and gave no right whatsoever to the petitioner pending appeal. The court 
believes that the intention of the law quoted above is to place an applicant for 
Philippine citizenship on probation for two years from the date of the 
promulgation of a final decision." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">When the applicant brought the case before this court on a 
petition for certiorari, this court, in a minute resolution, denied the petition 
for lack of merit. Evidently, this denial implies an affirmance of the above 
interpretation of the law by the lower court. </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the court hereby sets aside the order of the lower 
court of January 3, 1952, with costs against respondent Uy Chiong. </p>
<p align="justify">The writ of injunction issued by this Court is hereby declared 
final. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo,</span> and
