				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO CONCEPCION, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the People's Court finding the 
appellant, Francisco Concepcion, guilty of treason and sentencing him to life 
imprisonment and to pay a fine of P10,000 and the costs.
<p>The appellant was found guilty of treason on three counts, namely: The 
apprehension on December 7, 1944, in Cebu City, by the appellant (accompanied by 
Japanese) of Basilio Severino. (Count 3.) The apprehension on December 3, 1944, 
in Cebu City, by the appellant (accompanied by Japanese and Pablo Labra and 
Maximo Bate) of Clemente Chica. (Count 5.) The apprehension on January 9, 1944 
in Cebu City, by appellant (accompanied by Manuel Cocon and a Japanese) of 
Gavino Moras. The evidence for the prosecution shows that the three individuals 
were apprehended by the appellant or at his instigation, due to their guerrilla 
connections.</p>
<p>The first error assigned by counsel for the appellant as having been 
committed by the lower court has reference to its action in allowing the 
prosecution to present evidence of appellant's Filipino citizenship after the 
prosecution had rested its case and the defense had moved for dismissal. This 
assignment is untenable, as the matter of reopening a case for the reception of 
further evidence after either the prosecution cor the defense has rested is 
within the discretion of the trial court (23 C. J. S., par. 1056, pp. 464, 465, 
467).</p>
<p>Under the second, third and fourth assignments of error, counsel for the 
appellant argues that the charges of which the appellant was convicted have not 
been proven in accordance with the two-witness rule. Specifically it is 
contended that while prosecution witness Agapito Severino testified that the 
appellant, with a Japanese interpreter, arrived at their house and inquired if 
his Brother Basilio Severino was at home, and said that the latter was wanted at 
the military police headquarters for questioning, the other prosecution witness 
Edgardo Severino did not corroborate witness Agapito in this respect. Neither 
did the latter corroborate Edgardo as regards the fact that Basilio Severino was 
taking a bath and as regards Basilio's statement that the appellant and his 
companions should wait. There may not be corroboration between the two 
prosecution witnesses on the points mentioned, but said witnesses are uniform in 
their testimony that Bacilio Severino was arrested on December 7, 1944. The 
latter important detail constitutes the overt act of treason charged in count 
3.</p>
<p>The same consideration may be said regarding the criticism of appellant's 
counsel that there is lack of corroboration on seme details between prosecution 
witnesses Melchor Ugayong and Victoriano Cagitla, who, however, testified in 
unison on the overt act charged in count 5, namely, the apprehension by 
appellant of Clemente Chica.</p>
<p>As to count 6, it is contended by counsel for the defense that the testimony 
of the principal witnesses for the prosecution is merely to the effect that the 
appellant was waiting below the house of Gavino Moras (who was arrested), and 
that it was appellant's Japanese companions who came down from the house with 
said Gavino Moras. This argument is also without merit, it having been 
established by at least two witnesses that the appellant and his companions 
arrived at the house of Gavino at the same time, from which the conclusion is 
inescapable that he actually in a way aided in the apprehension of Gavino 
Moras.</p>
<p>It is lastly pretended by counsel for appellant that the latter was an 
ex-USAFFE officer and joined the Japanese under duress. There is nothing in the 
record which tends to indicate that the appellant apprehended or aided in the 
arrest of his victims under actual and imminent threats of death or bodily harm 
in case he should do otherwise. Upon the other hand, the evidence shows that he 
willingly perpetrated the acts of treason of which he was convicted by the lower 
court.</p>
<p>Counsel for the appellant has filed a motion for new trial based di newly 
discovered evidence tending to show that the ajrpellant was merely a liaison 
officer between the Provincial Government of Cebu and the Japanese Military 
Police; that three of the prosecution witnesses are retracting, and that the 
Appellant had saved some Filipinos arrested by the Japanese. The first point is 
sought to be established by affidavits of two Japanese war prisoners. These are 
not entitled to credit, as their affidavits were executed after the defeat of 
Japan in the last war, of which fact the Japanese affiants may be assumed to be 
aware. Besides, the alleged civilian position of the appellant did not prevent 
him from becoming a traitor to his country. Neither are the three retracting 
witnesses entitled to credit, since their affidavits are obviously the result of 
an afterthought, and if they could have lied during their testimony in court for 
some consideration or motive, they can now by the same token commit another 
falsity. The alleged circumstance that the appellant helped some of his 
countrymen arrested by the Japanese certainly does not exempt him from criminal 
liability.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment, being in conformity with the facts and the law, is 
affirmed. So ordered with costs.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Feria, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p>PARAS, J.:</p> Mr. Justice G. Pablo voted for the affirmance.</div>
