				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an action to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; the sum of P33,972.88, with Interest of 12%&nbsp; per annum form March&nbsp; 20, 1953, and the costs of action.<br><br>It is&nbsp; claimed that on&nbsp; December 24, 1952, plaintiff&nbsp; and defendant entered into an agreement the&nbsp; purpose of which is to produce a series of 13 half-hour chapters of television films for distribution in the United States and&nbsp; other countries, including the Philippines, both to share equally in the profits of the enterprise; that plaintiff would finance the production of the films and other expenses&nbsp; that might be necessary incident thereto not exceeding P100,000, while defendant would produce and direct the films;&nbsp; that, as agreed&nbsp; upon, plaintiff and defendant produced the&nbsp; pilot film of&nbsp; the&nbsp; series which cost P33,972.88 entirely financed by plaintiff;&nbsp; that on March 14,1953, plaintiff and defendant executed a supplemental agreement wherein&nbsp; defendant was authorized to go to the United States to offer for sale or distribution the film already made and its subsequent chapters in the&nbsp; United States&nbsp; subject to the following conditions: (1) if after sixty days from defendant's arrival in the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; he should&nbsp; fail to&nbsp; sell&nbsp; the films, production contract would be abandoned; (2) in that event, the production cost&nbsp; of the film&nbsp; amounting&nbsp; to P33,972.88 shall be paid to plaintiff in U.S. dollars sixty days after defendant's arrival in the United States, with interest at 12%&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">per annum;</span>&nbsp; and (3) after&nbsp; said amount is fully paid to plaintiff, the film would become the property of defendant;&nbsp; that, as agreed&nbsp; upon, defendant left for the United States carrying with him the pilot film of the series and five months thereafter&nbsp; he&nbsp; returned to the Philippines and informed plaintiff that the offers he received for the film were not satisfactory;&nbsp; and that, notwithstanding the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the 60-day period&nbsp; for&nbsp; the payment of the P33,972.88 as above-mentioned,&nbsp; defendant refused to pay the same despite repeated&nbsp; demands made upon him&nbsp; to that&nbsp; effect.<br><br>Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint fails to&nbsp; state a cause of&nbsp; action, which was opposed by plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the same was submitted for ruling, the court deferred its&nbsp; consideration until&nbsp; the case is tried on the merits for the reason that the ground appearing therein does not appear to be indubitable.<br><br>Defendant, answering the complaint, admitted some of the allegations therein while he denied others and set up certain special&nbsp; defenses,&nbsp; among which&nbsp; are:&nbsp; that plaintiff agreed to finance the production of the television picture "UMBRA" in&nbsp; an amount&nbsp; not&nbsp; exceeding P100,000; that after the production of the film has started, plaintiff refused to put in more capital in excess of P33,972.88 contrary to the agreement as a result of which the film was&nbsp; not completed and did&nbsp; not come up to the&nbsp; requirements&nbsp; of the U.S. television distributors; that since plaintiff refused to put in&nbsp; additional&nbsp; capital&nbsp; to convert&nbsp; the film into&nbsp; a feature length picture&nbsp; or&nbsp; into a serial of 13 chapters, his efforts to sell the same to U.S.&nbsp; distributors became fruitless; wherefore, defendant&nbsp; claims that his failure to sell the film is due to causes&nbsp; arising from&nbsp; plaintiff's fault. Defendant set up a counterclaim for the sum of P33,972.88, plus the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P6,000&nbsp; as additional compensation, for his services.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; meantime,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; died&nbsp; and&nbsp; the administrator of his estate was&nbsp; substituted in his place.<br><br>Issues having been&nbsp; joined, the court set the&nbsp; case for hearing on April 20, 1956.&nbsp; On&nbsp; April 16, defendant asked for postponement&nbsp; alleging&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was in&nbsp; Vietnam and would be absent for at least two months.&nbsp; Plaintiff having given his&nbsp; conformity, the&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; was&nbsp; postponed&nbsp; until further assignment. Upon&nbsp; plaintiff's request, the hearing was again set for September 13, 1956, but again defendant asked for another&nbsp; postponement this time alleging that he was taking steps to have the case amicably settled, which the court granted&nbsp; transferring the hearing to October 1 %, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the case was&nbsp; called on that day defendant, through&nbsp; counsel, asked for&nbsp; another&nbsp; postponement&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; in&nbsp; Naga,&nbsp; Camarines&nbsp; Sur, making pictures for the LVN, and because he submitted&nbsp; to plaintiff another proposal for amicable settlement.&nbsp; This&nbsp; time the court denied the motion and required plaintiff's counsel to submit his evidence, but&nbsp; instead of doing&nbsp; so, he&nbsp; merely submitted the case without&nbsp; evidence upon the theory that all the allegations&nbsp; of the complaint were admitted in the answer.&nbsp; Defendant's counsel, on his part, instead of submitting his evidence,&nbsp; moved for another&nbsp; postponement, but the same was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; And on October&nbsp; 19, 1956, the court&nbsp; rendered decision granting the relief prayed for in the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant took the present appeal when his motion for reconsideration was denied.<br><br>There&nbsp; is merit&nbsp; in the contention&nbsp; that&nbsp; the lower court erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; rendering judgment on the&nbsp; pleadings considering that not all the material allegations of the complaint were admitted in the answer for some of them were either denied or disputed, defendant going to the extent of setting up certain special defenses which, if proven, would&nbsp; have the effect of nullifying plaintiff's main cause&nbsp; of action.&nbsp; This is what our rule provides.&nbsp; Thus, under Section 10, Rule 35, judgment on the pleadings may only be rendered "where an answer fails to tender an issue, or&nbsp; otherwise admits the material allegations of the adverse party's pleading", and in a recent case, this Court made the following pronouncement:&nbsp;&nbsp; It is apparent from these rulings that judgment&nbsp; on the pleadings can&nbsp; only be rendered&nbsp; when&nbsp; the pleading of the party against whom the motion is directed, be he plaintiff or defendant, does not tender any&nbsp; issue, or admits all the material allegations of the pleading of the movant. Otherwise, judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered" (Fabella <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Provincial Sheriff&nbsp; of Rizal, 94 Phil., 35; Ongsing <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Riarte, 81&nbsp; Phil., 184; Alemany, et al. <i>vs.</i> Sweeney, 3 Phil., 114).&nbsp; Since some&nbsp; of the averments of the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; are controverted, it is evident that&nbsp; the trial court erred in rendering judgment&nbsp; on the&nbsp; pleadings.<br><br>To show that some of&nbsp; the&nbsp; averments of the&nbsp; complaint are controverted, we will cite some instances.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in paragraph 8 of the&nbsp; complaint, it is alleged that "defendant left for the United&nbsp; States carrying with him&nbsp; the pilot film of the series mentioned above, and&nbsp; after&nbsp; five months stay in the United States, he returned to&nbsp; the Philippines and&nbsp; informed plaintiff that&nbsp; the&nbsp; offers&nbsp; he received&nbsp; in&nbsp; the United States were not satisfactory."&nbsp; This is denied in&nbsp; the answer,&nbsp; for&nbsp; there&nbsp; it is&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; that said pilot film&nbsp; has&nbsp; always&nbsp; been in the possession of plaintiff and&nbsp; only&nbsp; a&nbsp; sample&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; was&nbsp; delivered to defendant for demonstration purposes, all&nbsp; negatives of the film having been always in plaintiff's possession.&nbsp; It is also&nbsp; there alleged that because what was brought by defendant to the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; was merely a&nbsp; copy&nbsp; and not the negative&nbsp; of the film, he was not able&nbsp; to&nbsp; sell it to the&nbsp; distributors&nbsp; in the&nbsp; United States.&nbsp; Another material&nbsp; allegation of the complaint is that defendant upon returning to the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; informed the plaintiff that the offers he received in the United States&nbsp; for the film were not&nbsp; satisfactory.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; also disputed by defendant in&nbsp; his&nbsp; answer by stating&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to invest more capital&nbsp; in excess&nbsp; of P33,972.88&nbsp; as a result of which the film was not completed and did not come up to the requirements&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; U. S. television&nbsp; distributors which accounted for his failure to sell the film to&nbsp; said distributors.<br><br>Plaintiff must have labored under the impression that, because defendant was not able to present evidence for his failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure the&nbsp; postponement of the hearing, the answer&nbsp; he filed failed to tender any issue and, misled by this&nbsp; stand,&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered judgment&nbsp; on the pleadings upon the theory that the material averments of the complaint&nbsp; were&nbsp; deemed admitted.&nbsp; This&nbsp; theory is erroneous because the failure of defendant to be present at the&nbsp; hearing can&nbsp; only have&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect of depriving him of&nbsp; his right to present evidence but certainly cannot imply an admission of the allegations of the complaint. Here two errors were committed: one by plaintiff's counsel for his&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to present evidence in support of the&nbsp; complaint, and another by the trial court for having rendered judgment without any evidence to support it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment thus rendered is therefore bereft of any validity and should be set aside.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; set aside. The&nbsp; case is remanded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; for further proceedings.
