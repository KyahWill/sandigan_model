				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. EDUARDO PRIETO (ALIAS EDDIE VALENCIA), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant was prosecuted in the People's Court for treason on 7 counts. 
After pleading not guilty he entered a plea of guilty to counts 1, 2, 3 and 7, 
and maintained the original plea as to counts 4, 5 and 6. The special prosecutor 
introduced evidence only on count 4, stating with reference to counts 5 and 6 
that he did not have sufficient evidence to sustain them. The defendant was 
found guilty of count 4 as well as counts 1, 2, 3 and 7 and was sentenced to 
death and to pay a fine of P20,000.<p>Two witnesses gave evidence on count 4 but their statements do not coincide 
on any single detail. Juanito Albaño, the first witness, testified that in 
March, 1945, the accused with other Filipino undercovers and Japanese soldiers 
caught an American aviator and had the witness carry the American to town on a 
sled pulled by a carabao; that on the way, the accused walked behind the sled 
and asked the prisoner if the sled was faster than the airplane; that the 
American was taken to the Kempetai head quarters, after which he did not know 
what happened to the flier. Valentin Cuison, the next witness, testified that 
one day in March, 1945, he saw the accused following an American whose hands 
were tied; that the accused struck the flier with a piece of rope; that with the 
American and the accused were Japanese and other Filipinos.</p>
<p>These witnesses evidently referred to two different occasions. The last 
witness stated that the American was walking as well as his captors, And there 
was no sled, he said, nor did he see Juanito Albaño, except at night when he and 
Albaño had a drink of tuba together.</p>
<p>This evidence does not satisfy the two-witness principle. The two witnesses 
failed to corroborate each other not only on the whole overt act but on any part 
of it, (People <em>vs</em>. Apolinar Adriano, 44 Off. Gaz., 4300; Cramer 
<em>vs</em>. U.S., 65 S. Ct. 918.)</p>
<p>The lower court believes that the accused is "guilty beyond reasonable doubt 
of the crime of treason complexed by murder and physical injuries," with "the 
aggravating circumstances mentioned above." Apparently, the court has regarded 
the murders and physical injuries charged in the information, not only as crimes 
distinct from treason but also as modifying circumstances. The Solicitor General 
agrees with the decision except as to the technical designation of the crime. In 
his opinion, the offense committed by the appellant is a "complex crime of 
treason with homicide."</p>
<p>Counts 1, 2, 3 and 7 are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. On or about October 15, 1944, in the Municipality of Mandaue, Province of 
Cebu, Philippines, said accused being a member of the Japanese Military Police 
and acting as undercover man for the Japanese forces with the purpose of giving 
and with the intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy did, then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and treasonably lead, guide and accompany a 
patrol of Japanese soldiers and Filipino undercovers to the barrio of Poknaon, 
for the purpose of apprehending guerrillas and locating their hideouts; that 
said accused and his companions did apprehend Abraham Puno, tie his hands behind 
him and give him fist blows; thereafter said Abraham Puno was taken by the 
accused and his Japanese companions to Yati, Liloan, Cebu, where he was severely 
tortured by placing red hot iron on his shoulders, legs and back and from there 
he was sent back to the Japanese detention camp in Mandaue and detained for 7 
days; </p>
<p>"2. On or about October 28, 1944, in the Municipality of Mandaue, Province of 
Cebu, Philippines, said accused acting as an informer and agent for the Japanese 
Military Police, with the purpose of giving and with the intent to give aid and 
comfort to the enemy, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and 
treasonably, lead, guide and accompany a group of Filipino undercovers for the 
purpose of apprehending guerrillas and guerrilla suspects; that the herein 
accused and his companions did in fact apprehend Guillermo Ponce and Macario 
Ponce from their house; that said accused and his companions did tie the hands 
of said Guillermo Ponce and Macario Ponce behind their backs, giving them fist 
blows on the face and in other parts of the body and thereafter detained them at 
the Kempei Tai Headquarters; that Guillermo Ponce was released the following day 
while his brother Macario Ponce was detained and thereafter nothing more was 
heard of him nor his whereabouts known;</p>
<p>"3. Sometime during the month of November, 1944, in the Municipality of 
Mandaue, Province of Cebu, Philippines, for the purpose of giving and with the 
intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy and her military forces, said 
accused acting as an enemy undercover did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully, 
feloniously, and treasonably lead, guide and accompany a patrol of some 6 
Filipinos and 2 Japanese soldiers to barrio Pakna-an, Municipality of Mandaue 
for the purpose of apprehending guerrillas and guerrilla suspects, and said 
patrol did in fact apprehend as guerrilla suspects Damian Alilin and Santiago 
Alilin who were forthwith tied with a rope, tortured and detained for 6 days; 
that on the 7th day said Damian Alilin and Santiago Alilin were taken about ½ 
kilometer from their home and the accused did bayonet them to death; </p>
<p>"7. In or about November 16, 1944, in Mandaue, in conspiracy with the enemy 
and other Filipino undercovers, said accused did cause the torture of Antonio 
Soco and the killing of Gil Soco for guerrilla activities."</p></blockquote>
<p>The execution of some of the guerrilla suspects mentioned in these counts and 
the infliction of physical injuries on others are not offenses separate from 
treason. Under the Philippine treason law and under the United States 
constitution defining treason, after which the former was patterned, there must 
concur both adherence to the enemy and giving him aid and comfort. One without 
the other does not make treason.</p>
<p>In the nature of things, the giving of aid and comfort can only be 
accomplished by some kind of action. Its very nature partakes of a deed or 
physical activity as opposed to a mental operation. (Cramer <em>vs</em>. U.S., 
<em>ante</em>.) This deed or physical activity may be, and often is, in itself a 
criminal offense under another penal statute or provision. Even so, when the 
deed is charged as an element of treason it becomes identified with the latter 
crime and can not be the subject of a separate punishment, or used in 
combination with treason to increase the penalty as Article 48 of the Revised 
Penal Code provides. Just as one can not be punished for possessing opium in a 
prosecution for smoking the identical drug, end a robber cannot be held guilty 
of coercion or trespass to a dwelling in a prosecution for robbery, because 
possession of opium and force and trespass are inherent in smoking and in 
robbery respectively, so may not a defendant be made liable for murder as a 
separate crime or in conjunction with another offense where, as in this case, it 
is averred as a constitutive ingredient of treason. This rule would not, of 
course, preclude the punishment of murder or physical injuries as such if the 
government should elect to prosecute the culprit specifically for those crimes 
instead of relying dn them as an element of treason. It is where murder or 
physical injuries are charged as overt acts of treason that they can not be 
regarded separately under their general denomination.</p>
<p>However, the brutality with which the killing or physical injuries were 
carried out may be taken as an aggravating circumstance. Thus, the use of 
torture and other atrocities on the victims instead of the usual and less 
painful method of execution will be taken into account to increase the penalty 
under the provision of article 14, paragraph 21, of the Revised Penal Code, 
since they, as in this case, augmented the sufferings of the offended parties 
unnecessarily to the attainment of the criminal objective.</p>
<p>This aggravating circumstance is compensated by the mitigating circumstance 
of plea of guilty. It is true that the accused pleaded not guilty to counts 4, 5 
and 6 but count 4 has not been substantiated while counts 5 and 6 were 
abandoned.</p>
<p>In his first assignment of error, counsel seeks reversal of the judgment 
because of the trial court's failure to appoint "another attorney de oficio for 
the accused in spite of the manifestation of the attorney de oficio (who 
defended the accused at the trial) that he would like to be relieved for obvious 
reasons".</p>
<p>The appellate tribunal will indulge reasonable presumptions in favor of the 
legality and regularity of all the proceedings of the trial court, including the 
presumption that the accused was not denied the right to have counsel. (U.S. 
<em>vs</em>. Labial, 27 Phil. 82.) It is presumed that the procedure prescribed 
by law has been observed unless it is made to appear expressly to the contrary. 
(U.S. <em>vs</em>. Escalante, 36 Phil., 743.) The fact that the attorney 
appointed by the trial court to aid the defendant in his defense expressed 
reluctance to accept the designation because, as the present counsel assumes, he 
did not sympathize with the defendant's cause, is not sufficient to overcome 
this presumption. The statement of the counsel in the court below did not 
necessarily imply that he did not perform his duty to protect the interest of 
the accused. As a matter of fact, the present counsel "sincerely believes that 
the said Attorney Carin did his best, although it was not the best of a willing 
worker," We do not discern in the record any indication that the former counsel 
did not conduct the defense to the best of his ability. If Attorney Garin did 
his best as a sworn member of the bar, as the present attorney admits, that was 
enough; his sentiments did not cut any influence in the result of the case and 
did not imperil the rights of the appellant.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we find the defendant not guilty of count 4 and guilty of 
treason as charged in counts 1, 2, 3 and 7. There being an aggravating 
circumstance and a mitigating circumstance, the penalty to be imposed is 
<em>reclusiòn perpetua</em>. The judgment of the lower court will be modified in 
this respect accordingly. In all other particulars, the same will be affirmed. 
It is so ordered, with costs of this instance against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon,</em> and 
<em>Padilla, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p>PARÁS, J.:</p>
<p>I concur in the result. Appellant is guilty of murder.</p></div>
