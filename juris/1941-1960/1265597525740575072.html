				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an appeal by&nbsp; certiorari from a decision&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; reading&nbsp; as follows: <blockquote><p>"Before us&nbsp; are two civil cases from the Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; In one, No. 8974, Woodcraft Works, Ltd., is the plaintiff;&nbsp; in the other,&nbsp; No. 9029, the plaintiff is the Insular Saw&nbsp; Mill, Inc. Both&nbsp; are for&nbsp; recovery of the sum of money and, in&nbsp; each,&nbsp; Charlie&nbsp; Hogan and Dee C. Tarn as partners in an unregistered partnership,&nbsp; are the defendants.&nbsp; </p><p>"After joint hearing, Judge Macadaeg rendered judgment granting the claims of Woodcraft Works, Ltd., and the Insular Saw&nbsp; Mill, Inc. against Charlie Hogan alone, while Dee C. Tarn was freed from any liability.&nbsp; Both Woodcraft, Ltd., and the Insular Saw&nbsp; Mill, Inc.,&nbsp; appealed Woodcraft Works,&nbsp; Ltd., assigning&nbsp; the following&nbsp; errors: </p><p>'1.&nbsp; The lower court errer in holding that&nbsp; the unregistered partnership 'Charlie&nbsp; Hogan &amp;&nbsp; Co., Ganie Enterprises' between the herein defendants-appellee&nbsp; Charlie Hogan and Dee C. Tarn had&nbsp; been dissolved prior to the&nbsp; dates appellee Charlie Hogan incurred in behalf&nbsp; of said partnership the obligation subject matter hereof from plaintiff-appellan.&nbsp; </p><p>'2.&nbsp; The lower court likewise erred in absolving defendant-appellee Dee C. Tarn&nbsp; from&nbsp; any liability whatever&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant. and the&nbsp; Insular Saw Mill, Inc., alleging:&nbsp; </p></blockquote><ol><li>The triad court&nbsp; erred in holding that there was a dissolution of the partnership&nbsp; Charlie Hogan &amp;&nbsp; Co., doing business&nbsp; under the&nbsp; name and style of 'Ganie Enterprises' prior to the obligations contracted by Charlie Hogan in the name of the partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>The trial court erred in&nbsp; declaring that&nbsp; only the&nbsp; defendant Charlie&nbsp; Hogan is&nbsp; liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; the obligation&nbsp; contracted&nbsp; under&nbsp; the partnership&nbsp; name,&nbsp; and in absolving&nbsp; the defendant,&nbsp; Dee C.&nbsp; Tam, from&nbsp; liability for said obligations.'&nbsp; </li></ol><blockquote><p>"No controversy exists regarding the fact that Woodcraft Works, Ltd.,&nbsp; a duly&nbsp; registered&nbsp; corporation dealing&nbsp; on lumber,&nbsp; furnished&nbsp; lumber value&nbsp; of P4,955.77 to Charlie&nbsp; Hogan during the months of May&nbsp; and June,&nbsp; 1949.&nbsp; In payment,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter delivered&nbsp; that&nbsp; sum in three checks D-18267, D-18269 and) D-18270 drawn against the Philippine&nbsp; Bank of&nbsp; Communications, Manila, but which&nbsp; were not honored&nbsp; upon their&nbsp; presentation&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; drawee&nbsp; Bank.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is also no&nbsp; question that&nbsp; Charlie. Hogan&nbsp; received lumber valued&nbsp; at Pl,472.17 from the Insular&nbsp; Saw Mill, Inc., on April 30, May 3 and May 5,&nbsp; 1949.&nbsp; In this connection,&nbsp; it was agreed that Charlie Hogan would pay interest at the&nbsp; rate of one per cent per month on. the amount&nbsp; due and the sum equivalent to 20%&nbsp; thereof for attorney's fees and&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs, should the collection&nbsp; be&nbsp; enforced&nbsp; through court action.</p><p>"The&nbsp; only issue, therefore, is whether Charlie Hogan's co-defendant in both cases, Dee C.&nbsp; Tam, is severally and jointly liable with him.&nbsp; We are completely in agreement with the court below that Charlie&nbsp; Hogan alone is responsible for the lumber.&nbsp; In the case of Woodcraft&nbsp; Works, Ltd., the latter delivered&nbsp; the&nbsp; lumber during the months of,May and June, 1949, and the Insular Saw Mill, Inc., on April 30 and May 3&nbsp; and May&nbsp; 5, 1949.&nbsp; The partnership between Charlie&nbsp; Hogan and Dee C. Tam was drawn up in a public document on April 9, 1949, but was never&nbsp; registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp; After a few days, that is, on April 25, 1949, it was dissolved, as&nbsp; shown by a&nbsp; public document&nbsp; duly executed&nbsp; to that effect.&nbsp; At the&nbsp; time of the&nbsp; delivery of the Insular to&nbsp; Charlie Hogan,&nbsp; the latter was no&nbsp; longer&nbsp; in&nbsp; partnership with Dee&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Tam.</p><p>"If Charlie&nbsp; Hogan had&nbsp; made&nbsp; herein appellants&nbsp; believe that he was taking the&nbsp; lumber in behalf of the unregistered&nbsp; partnership of which Dee&nbsp; C&nbsp; Tam was&nbsp; a member, that was certainly his own concern.&nbsp; For, subject to the exceptions .provided by law, 'the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by the act, declaration or commission of another * * *'&nbsp; (Section 10, Rule 123, Rules of Court.)&nbsp; </p><p>"There is no merit in the contention that the partnership was not dissolved.&nbsp; The deed&nbsp; of dissolution was executed on April 25, 1949. The partnership constituted between Charlie Hogan and Dee C. Tam on April 9, 1949 and which was not registered, could not have been dissolved in any way better than what they&nbsp; had done, agreeing on its dissolution through a public instrument which they signed together on&nbsp; April&nbsp; 25, 1949.&nbsp; Appellants failed to make any showing why we&nbsp; should believe that the said deed of dissolution is false.&nbsp; </p><p>FOR ALL THE FOREGOING, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against appellants."</p></blockquote><p>Petitioner-appellant Insular Saw Mill, Inc., has appealed from the&nbsp; foregoing decision as regards&nbsp; said case No.&nbsp; 9029, upon the ground&nbsp; that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals erred in absolving&nbsp; the respondent Dee&nbsp; C. Tam from liability&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner Insular Saw&nbsp; Mill, Inc., for credit purchases made by the partnership from the said petitioner on the simple ground that when said purchases were made, Dee C. Tam was no longer in partnership with&nbsp; Charlie&nbsp; Hogan, although the petitioner in extending said credit acted and&nbsp; believed in good faith that the partnership was still existing as there was no notice given or knowledge acquired on the alleged dissolution&nbsp; thereof, and hence, in the disposition of this case, the&nbsp; Court of Appeals has decided a question of substance not heretofore determining by the Supreme Court."</p></blockquote><p>There is no merit in petitioner's contention&nbsp; for:&nbsp; </p><ol><li> Dee&nbsp; C. Tam may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be held responsible for such misrepresentation, if any,&nbsp; as Charlie Hogan&nbsp; may have made to petitioner herein, there being nothing&nbsp; to&nbsp; show that Tam&nbsp; had authorized&nbsp; or ratified said act&nbsp; of Hogan;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li> Had&nbsp; Hogan&nbsp; misrepresented that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; acting on behalf of the partnership, the corresponding invoices would have been&nbsp; issued in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; said partnership,&nbsp; but plaintiff-petitioner did not do so;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li> Pursuant to&nbsp; the Articles of Co-partnership&nbsp; executed by Tam and Hogan, "the stock for&nbsp; said company shall be purchased under agreement&nbsp; of both parties" and there is no proofs or even allegation, that Dee C. Tam had agreed or consented&nbsp; to the purchases&nbsp; in question&nbsp; from plaintiff herein;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li> Said Articles of Co-partnership state&nbsp; that Tam and Hogan had formed a "business partnership *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; which will the dealing (in) lumber, hardware and building construction&nbsp; materials".&nbsp; Said partnership was,&nbsp; therefore, a general commercial partnership (Prautch, Scholes &amp; Co. <em>vs.</em> Hernandez, 1&nbsp; Phil., 705; 2 Blanco, 202).&nbsp; Being unregistered, Charlie Hogan,&nbsp; as general manager and treasurer thereof, is the only person responsible for&nbsp; its obligations in favor of the third parties,&nbsp; under Article 120, Code of Commerce, reading: <br><br>"Those in charge of the&nbsp; company's management who violate the provisions of the preceding article shall be solidarily responsible to persons not members of the association with whom they&nbsp; may have contracted&nbsp; in its name."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li> The aforementioned transactions with petition-appellant took place after the dissolution&nbsp; of the partnership. It is&nbsp; urged, however,&nbsp; that said dissolution cannot affect the rights of plaintiff herein, for Article 226 of the Code of&nbsp; Commerce,&nbsp; declares: <br></li></ol><blockquote><p>"The dissolution ox a commercial association, which proceeds from any cause other&nbsp; than&nbsp; the termination&nbsp; of the period for which&nbsp; it was created, shall not&nbsp; produce any&nbsp; effect to the prejudice of third persons&nbsp; until it is entered&nbsp; in the mercantile registry."</p></blockquote><p>However, this provision refers solely to <span style="font-style: italic;">registered</span> partnerships, for, in dealing with the same, third parties are entitled to give full faith and&nbsp; credence to the articles of co-partnership recorded&nbsp; in the mercantile registry.&nbsp; It does not apply to unregistered partnerships, inasmuch as those transacting business with the&nbsp; same have no such official record to rely on and are deemed satisfied with the solidary obligation of the manager of the partnership, pursuant to the above&nbsp; quoted Article 120&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Code of Commerce (Jo Chung&nbsp; Cang et al.&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Pacific Commercial Co., et al, 45 Phil., 142, 152; The&nbsp; Manila Railroad Co, <em>vs.</em> t. S. Salmon, 48 Phil.,&nbsp; 132,&nbsp; 137; Hung-Man-Yoc <em>vs.</em> Kieng-Chiong- Seng, 6 Phil., 498; Ang Seng Quen et al. <em>vs.</em> Juan Te Chico et al., 12 Phil., 547-550).</p><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
