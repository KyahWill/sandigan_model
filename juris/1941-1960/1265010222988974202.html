				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The question for&nbsp; determination&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case is whether a justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; peace court&nbsp; has the authority&nbsp; to revive' its&nbsp; own&nbsp; judgment.<br><br>It appears&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; was rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; justice of the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; court&nbsp; of Carmen, Bohol,&nbsp; ordering the&nbsp; defendant in&nbsp; a forcible entry&nbsp; and detainer&nbsp; case to restore possession of&nbsp; a piece&nbsp; of&nbsp; land and pay damages to the plaintiffs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; judgment having remained unsatisfied for more than five&nbsp; years,&nbsp; the plaintiffs, on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; brought the&nbsp; present action to have it revived in&nbsp; the same justice of the&nbsp; peace court. The defendant opposed the action,&nbsp; but the&nbsp; court, after hearing, declared the judgment revived and again ordered what was necessary to be done in compliance therewith.<br><br>The defendant appealed to the&nbsp; Court of First Instance, but as&nbsp; he failed to file a supersedeas bond, the plaintiffs asked for a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; execution.&nbsp; With&nbsp; that&nbsp; motion&nbsp; still pending&nbsp; determination,&nbsp; the defendant on his&nbsp; part&nbsp; filed a motion for the dismissal of the case, contending that the Court of First&nbsp; Instance, as&nbsp; an appellate court,&nbsp; had no&nbsp; jurisdiction to try&nbsp; it because, according&nbsp; to him, the justice&nbsp; of the peace&nbsp; court itself did&nbsp; not&nbsp; have jurisdiction to&nbsp; entertain&nbsp; an&nbsp; action&nbsp; for the&nbsp; revival&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; judgment. Upholding this contention&nbsp; and also holding' the plaintiffs guilty of laches for&nbsp; failing to secure a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; execution within&nbsp; five years,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance ordered the case&nbsp; dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; From that&nbsp; order,&nbsp; the plaintiffs appealed&nbsp; directly to this Court,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we see that&nbsp; the question involved&nbsp; is purely legal.<br><br>The&nbsp; appeal is well taken.&nbsp; Matters&nbsp; pertaining to the "execution, satisfaction and&nbsp; effect&nbsp; of&nbsp; judgments",&nbsp; are governed by&nbsp; the provisions of&nbsp; Rule 39,&nbsp; and&nbsp; section&nbsp; 6 of that rule provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Execution by motion&nbsp; or by independent action</i>.—A judgment may be executed&nbsp; on motion within five years from&nbsp; the date of its entry. After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute of&nbsp; limitations,&nbsp; a judgment may be&nbsp; enforced by action."</blockquote>This provision, and for&nbsp; that matter the whole of Rule 39, is applicable in inferior&nbsp; courts as Rule 4, which governs the procedure in those courts,&nbsp; expressly declares in its section 19.&nbsp;&nbsp; That section&nbsp; reads:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 19. <i>Application of certain rules</i>—Rules&nbsp; 10, 12, I3,&nbsp; 14, 18, 28, 29, 30&nbsp; and 39 are applicable in inferior courts in cases&nbsp; falling within their jurisdictions and in so&nbsp; far as they are&nbsp; inconsistent. with&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of thin rule.</blockquote>" We see nothing&nbsp; in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 6&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule 39 that is inconsistent with Rule 4.<br><br>Furthermore,&nbsp; the Judiciary Act of 1948 gives justice of&nbsp; the peace courts jurisdiction over&nbsp; actions&nbsp; of&nbsp; forcible entry and detainer and&nbsp; also empowers them&nbsp; (in&nbsp; its&nbsp; section 91)&nbsp; to issue all "processes necessary&nbsp; to enforce their orders&nbsp; and judgments".&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say, the revival of a judgment is a necessary step in&nbsp; its enforcement where, as&nbsp; in the present case, the judgment, which has remained" unsatisfied for&nbsp; more than&nbsp; five years, can no longer&nbsp; be executed&nbsp; upon mere&nbsp; motion and&nbsp; has to&nbsp; be&nbsp; enforced&nbsp; by action as&nbsp; provided in section 6 of Rule 39.<br><br>The authority of a justice of the peace&nbsp; court to revive&nbsp; its own&nbsp; judgment being clear, it was error&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss plaintiff's action&nbsp; on the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; that such authority&nbsp; did' not exist.<br><br>Holding the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; guilty of laches for failing&nbsp; to secure&nbsp; a&nbsp; writ of execution within five&nbsp; years&nbsp; from&nbsp; the entry of&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court would also, on&nbsp; that ground, deprive them of&nbsp; their right to&nbsp; have the judgment revived.&nbsp; To that we cannot agree.&nbsp; It is clear that section 6 of&nbsp; Rule 39 gives&nbsp; the plaintiffs not only the&nbsp; right to&nbsp; enforce the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; through a&nbsp; mere&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for execution within five years, but also, after the expiration of that period without the judgment having been satisfied, the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; bring an&nbsp; action for&nbsp; its enforcement within the time&nbsp; prescribed by&nbsp; the statute of limitations.&nbsp; We would be&nbsp; construing the&nbsp; section arbitrarily were we&nbsp; to hold&nbsp; that&nbsp; the right&nbsp; to bring that action&nbsp;&nbsp; is forfeited&nbsp; if the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; move for execution&nbsp; has not&nbsp; been exercised.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of the foregoing,&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; dismissal is&nbsp; set aside&nbsp; and&nbsp; the case remanded to the court below for further proceedings.&nbsp; Costs against the defendants.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Baidista, Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B, L.,&nbsp; Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
