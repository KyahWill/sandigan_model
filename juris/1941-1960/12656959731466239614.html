				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This proceeding relates to the refusal of the Court of Appeals 
to dismiss respondent's appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
Laguna. The ground of the motion to dismiss was that no appeal bond had been 
filed before the record on appeal was approved.
<p align="justify">All are agreed that appeal bond is essential to the perfection 
of an appeal. That such bond was not submitted up to the time the record on 
appeal was approved is attested by the record.</p>
<p align="justify">The reasons for the Court of Appeals' order denying the motion 
to dismiss are not stated. It appears from the statements of counsel in the 
course of the oral argument that the Court of Appeals relied on the case of 
Santiago vs. Valenzuela (78 Phil., 397). </p>
<p align="justify">There is little or no analogy between that case and the case at 
bar. In the case cited, the appellee not only failed to object to the approval 
of the record on appeal in the Court of First Instance but he moved the Supreme 
Court to dismiss the appeal only after the appellants had presented their 
brief.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner here is not guilty of unreasonable delay. If the 
intervenor and appellee did not oppose the approval of the record on appeal in 
the court below, it was because of the belief that all the legal requirements 
had been fulfilled. The counsel for the appellant himself helped to lull the 
counsel for the intervenor and appellee into this belief; the former had asked 
for an extension of 30 days to file the record on appeal and an appeal bond 
thereby implying that such bond was forthcoming. When they discovered the 
ommission, appellee's counsel lost no time in taking steps to have the appeal 
dismissed by the Court of First Instance, and when that motion was denied 
because, according to that court, the record had been transmitted to the Court 
of Appeals and it had lost jurisdiction over the case, the motion was, without 
unnecessary delay, reiterated in the appellate court.</p>
<p align="justify">The writ is granted with costs against respondent 
Temporosa.</p>

<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p align="justify">PERFECTO,<i> J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">We dissent.</p>
<p align="justify">There is not enough ground to reverse the action of the Court 
of Appeals.</p>
<p align="justify">Failure to file an appeal bond can be corrected and in the 
present case correction will not do any harm to any party.</p>
<p align="justify">The right to appeal must not be defeated by a mere procedural 
technicality.</p> The administration of justice must not be made futile by resort 
to technical matter of form that do not affect the substantial rights of the 
parties.</div>
