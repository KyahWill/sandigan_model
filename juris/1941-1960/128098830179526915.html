				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This record is here pursuant to plaintiff's prayer in the court 
below that if "be forwarded to the Hon. Supreme Court, together with all
 the evidence oral or documentary in order that the Court may pass upon 
the question of law as well as the issues of facts that may be raised in
 this appeal."
  <p>    It appears that, on Jan. 19, 1950 Go Bon Chiat an administrator
 of the estate of the deceased Go Bongco filed a complaint in the court 
of first instance of Misamis Oriental, to recover from Pedro Valmorida a
 portion of a certain parcel of land in the <i>poblacion</i> of 
Balingasag, same province, alleging that Go Bongco was owner of the 
whole parcel by virtue of a decision he had obtained in a litigation 
against one Go Bianchong alias Go Siogan, and that defendant was 
unlawfully detaining a part thereof.</p>
  <p>    The defendant answered that he had purchased the lot from 
Eduardo B. Co, heir of Go Bongco, and that the decision invoked by 
plaintiff had never become final, was never executed, and was null and 
void.</p>
  <p>    On March 28 and 29, 1950 trial was had and the plaintiff 
presented his testimonial and documentary evidence (p. 8, Record on 
Appeal).  The next day, the defendant, reserving his right to present 
evidence, moved for dismissal of the complaint, because the decision 
which plaintiff invoked had been appealed and plaintiff did not prove 
that it was affirmed and executed, and also because plaintiff's evidence
 did not sufficiently identify the land he (defendant) possessed with 
the lot awarded in the former decision.</p>
  <p>    Plaintiff replied to the motion.  Defendant submitted a 
rejoinder.</p>
  <p>    The Court in a decision dated April 14, 1950, analysing the 
evidence, dismissed the case saying in part, </p>
  <blockquote>"In this light of the evidence presented by the plaintiff,
 the Court is at a loss to conclude: (1) whether the plaintiff is the 
real owner of the land in question, (2) whether or not, the decision 
appearing in Exhibit B, refers to the land in question in the present 
case, (3) whether or not, said decision, Exhibit B, was confirmed, 
whether or not, said decision was ever executed, and (5) that Exhibits C
 and D, are not clear evidence of the fact that said decision in Civil 
Case No. 4438, if it became final, was really executed."</blockquote> 
  <p>The plaintiff on May 3, 1950, filed a motion for new trial alleging
 excusable mistake or negligence and enclosing the affidavits of three 
persons plus some documents purposely to remedy the deficiencies in his 
proofs.  But the court denied the petition explaining that even with the
 additional evidence the right of the plaintiff had not been 
sufficiently established.  Hence this appeal.</p>
  <p>    In support of his assignments of error plaintiff extensively 
discusses questions of fact, quoting portions of the stenographic notes,
 and citing his documentary exhibits.  The defendant's brief meets the 
issue of sufficiency of the evidence.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, inasmuch as the value of the property in litigation 
is only a little over five thousand pesos (p. 2, Record on Appeal) and 
factual points are involved, the controversy does not fall within our 
appellate power to review and should be referred to the Court of Appeals
 in accordance with law.  The consequent delay is regrettable, but this 
Court can only take action on a case when its turn comes up for 
consideration, and we are not at liberty to skip the matter of 
jurisdiction.  Besides parties are supposed to observe the lines of 
demarcation separating the two appellate fields of adjudication in order
 that no loss of time shall result from their taking steps in the wrong 
direction.</p>
  <p>    Let the record be sent to the Court of Appeals.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Tuason, Montemayor, Jugo, 
Bautista Angelo</i>, and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. <i><br>
    Reyes, J.,</i> no part. </p>
