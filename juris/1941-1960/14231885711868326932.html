				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; action to cancel an execution lien annotated on a Torrens certificate&nbsp; of title.<br><br>The&nbsp; facts&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; in&nbsp; dispute.&nbsp; By a&nbsp; deed&nbsp; executed on July 17,&nbsp; 1946,&nbsp; the spouses&nbsp; Fulgencio&nbsp; Moreno&nbsp; and Maria Salome sold to the&nbsp; plaintiff Vicente&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Capistrano the land described in&nbsp; TCT No.&nbsp; 19920 of the land records of&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; province,&nbsp; subject to&nbsp; a mortgage&nbsp; constituted upon said land in&nbsp; favor of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Though the&nbsp; buyer had assumed the&nbsp; obligation of paying the said mortgage, the&nbsp; sale could not then be registered because the Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance Corporation, as&nbsp; successor&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Agricultural and&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Bank, had&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner's&nbsp; duplicate&nbsp; certificate of title and would not release&nbsp; it unless the buyer also&nbsp; assumed the obligation of&nbsp; paying&nbsp; a deficiency claim against the seller Fulgencio Moreno&nbsp; (in connection with a prior loan) for which the same land was made answerable.&nbsp; And the sale&nbsp; was still unregistered when, nearly four years later, i.e., on June 22, 1950, the&nbsp; land was levied upon to satisfy a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; against Moreno&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank, the levy being on that same day recorded in the&nbsp; register of deeds of&nbsp; Quezon province and annotated upon the certificate&nbsp; of title.<br><br>On July&nbsp; 25, 1952, the Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance Corporation, answering an inquiry from the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; informed the latter that the land could&nbsp; no longer be&nbsp; "attached"&nbsp; to satisfy&nbsp; the judgment against Moreno because the same had1 already been&nbsp; sold by&nbsp; Moreno&nbsp; and his wife to Capistrano.&nbsp; And later, when the land&nbsp; was advertised for auction by the&nbsp; provincial sheriff, Capistrano filed a third party claim asserting his&nbsp; title thereto by&nbsp; virtue of the sale&nbsp; made in his favor by the Morenos on&nbsp; July 17, 1946.<br><br>Notified of the third party claim, the Philippine National Bank put up the necessary bond of indemnification, where- upon the provincial&nbsp; sheriff proceeded with&nbsp; the auction. And the bank having&nbsp; submitted the only bid, a certificate of sale was issued to it by the&nbsp; sheriff, which was registered on November 26, 1952 and annotated on the title certificate.<br><br>On&nbsp; November&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; Capistrano,&nbsp; after&nbsp; paying Moreno's&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; obligation' with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, obtained a cancellation&nbsp; of mortgage from the latter, and upon the cancellation being recorded in&nbsp; the registry of deeds&nbsp; he was&nbsp; issued a clean&nbsp; title (T-16984) except for the annotation thereon that it&nbsp; was subject to the execution. lien in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank.<br><br>To cancel&nbsp; that annotation&nbsp; and at the same&nbsp; time have the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; sale&nbsp; declared&nbsp; void,&nbsp; Capistrano&nbsp; instituted the&nbsp; present&nbsp; action in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Quezon province.&nbsp; He then&nbsp; won.&nbsp; But the defendants have appealed,&nbsp; and the case is&nbsp; now&nbsp; before us because the question at issue&nbsp; is purely legal.<br><br>It&nbsp; is to be&nbsp; noted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; above statement of facts that though the land in question was deeded to Capistrano as&nbsp; far back&nbsp; as 1946, it was&nbsp; not&nbsp; until November&nbsp; 19, 1953 that the&nbsp; conveyance was&nbsp; registered,&nbsp; and&nbsp; during that&nbsp; interregnum the land was&nbsp; subjected to&nbsp; a levy of execution which&nbsp; was recorded in the registry long before the registration of the deed of sale in favor of Capistrano. The&nbsp; question&nbsp; presented&nbsp; is whether,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; those&nbsp; facts, the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; should&nbsp; take precedence&nbsp; over the levy instead of the levy taking precedence over the sale.<br><br>Following the doctrine&nbsp; laid down in Lanci <i>vs. </i>Yangco (52 Phil. 563), the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; gave precedence&nbsp; to&nbsp; the sale.&nbsp; To&nbsp; this&nbsp; we&nbsp; cannot agree, for that&nbsp; doctrine&nbsp; has already&nbsp; been&nbsp; declared&nbsp; abandoned&nbsp; (Philippine&nbsp; National Bank&nbsp; <i>vs. </i>Camus, 70 Phil. 269; Resolution on motion&nbsp; for reconsideration in Hernandez <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Katigbak, 69 Phil. 748), and the&nbsp; rule&nbsp; now followed is&nbsp; that&nbsp; if&nbsp; the attachment or levy&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution,&nbsp; though&nbsp; posterior&nbsp; to&nbsp; the sale, is registered before the sale is registered, it takes precedence over the latter (Ramirez <i>vs. </i>Causin, et al., <i>supra,</i> p. 1009).<br><br>The rule is not altered&nbsp; by the fact that at the time of the execution sale the Philippine National&nbsp; Bank had information&nbsp; that the land&nbsp; levied upon&nbsp; had&nbsp; already been deeded by the judgment debtor and his "Wife to Capistrano. The auction sale being a&nbsp; necessary sequel&nbsp; to&nbsp; the levy, for this&nbsp; was effected precisely to carry out&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; the purchase made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the bank at said auction&nbsp; should enjoy the same legal&nbsp; priority that the levy had over&nbsp; the sale in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, the&nbsp; auction sale retroacts to the&nbsp; date of the levy. Were the rule otherwise, the&nbsp; preference&nbsp; enjoyed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; levy of&nbsp; execution in a case like the present would be meaningless&nbsp; and illusory (Vargas&nbsp; <i>vs. </i>Tancioco,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; 67 Phil.&nbsp; 308;&nbsp; Philippine Executive Commission <i>vs.</i> Abadilla,&nbsp; 74 Phil.&nbsp; 68.)<br><br>In view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the foregoing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; below&nbsp;&nbsp; is reversed and plaintiff's action dismissed.&nbsp; With coats.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J, Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angela, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ,,&nbsp; </i>concur.<br></div>
