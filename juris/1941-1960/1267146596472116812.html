				<H3>ROSARIO GREY VDA. DE ALBAR AND JOSE M. GREY, PETITIONERS, VS.  JOSEPA FABIE DE CARANGDANG, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Dona Rosario Fabie y Grey was the owner of&nbsp; a&nbsp; lot situated in the City of Manila with a building and improvements thereon erected&nbsp; at 950-956 Ongpin as evidenced by Original Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 5030, and by&nbsp; a will&nbsp; left by&nbsp; her upon&nbsp; her&nbsp; death&nbsp; which&nbsp; was&nbsp; duly&nbsp; probated&nbsp; she devised the&nbsp; naked ownership of the&nbsp; whole property to Rosario Grey Vda. de Albar, et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; but its usufruct to Josefa&nbsp; Fabie for&nbsp; life.<br><br>The&nbsp; pertinent provision of the&nbsp; will reads&nbsp; as follows: "Lego a mi a ahijada menor de edad, Maria Josefa de la Paz Fabie, en usufructo vitalicio&nbsp; las&nbsp; rentas de&nbsp; las&nbsp; fincas * *&nbsp; * en&nbsp; la calle Ongpin, Numeros 950 al 956 del Distrito de&nbsp; Santa Cruz,&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; * *&nbsp; * y prohibo&nbsp; enajene,&nbsp; hipoteque, permuta o transfiera de algun modo mientras que ella sea&nbsp; menor&nbsp; de edad."&nbsp; Said property was&nbsp; registered&nbsp; in the name of Rosario Grey Vda. de Albar, et al. as&nbsp; naked owners&nbsp; and the right of Josefa Fabie as&nbsp; life usufructuary was expressly noted on&nbsp; the new title.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to&nbsp; the 9th clause of the will, an encumbrance was likewise noted on the title prohibiting the usufructuary&nbsp; from&nbsp; selling, mortgaging or transferring her right of usufruct during her minority.<br><br>During "liberation, as&nbsp; a consequence of&nbsp; the fire that gutted the buildings in many portions of Manila, the building on the Ongpin lot was burned,&nbsp; leaving only the walls and other improvements that were not destroyed by the fire.<br><br>One Au Pit, a Chinaman, offered to lease the property for a period of five years at a monthly rental of P500.00, at the same time agreeing to construct on the lot a new building worth&nbsp; P30,000.00 provided the naked owners as well as the usufructuary sign the agreement of lease.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the usufructuary maintains that&nbsp; she has&nbsp; the exclusive right to cede the property by lease and to receive the full rental value by virtue of her right of usufruct while on the other hand the naked owners maintain that the right of usufruct was extinguished when the building was destroyed, the right of the usufructuary being limited to the legal interest on the value of the lot and the materials, in order that the agreement of lease may&nbsp; be effected, the&nbsp; parties agreed on a temporary compromise whereby&nbsp; the naked owners would receive P100.00, or 20% of the monthly rental of P500.00 and the usufructuary&nbsp; the&nbsp; balance of 80%&nbsp; or P400.00 of said monthly rental.&nbsp; It was likewise stipulated in the agreement&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; title&nbsp; to the&nbsp; building to&nbsp; be constructed would accrue to the land upon its completion as an integral&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot covered by the transfer certificate of title issued in the name of the naked owners but subject to the right of usufruct of Josef a Fabie.&nbsp; The parties expressly reserved the right to litigate their respective claims after the termination of the contract of lease to determine which of said claims was legally correct.<br><br>By&nbsp; reason of&nbsp; the destruction of the building on&nbsp; the Ongpin property, the&nbsp; United States War Damage Commission approved the&nbsp; claim that&nbsp; was&nbsp; presented&nbsp; for&nbsp; the damage caused to the property in the amount of P8,574.00 which was paid to and received by the naked owners.&nbsp; In the meantime, the usufructuary paid&nbsp; the real estate taxes due&nbsp; on&nbsp; the property at Ongpin&nbsp; for the years 1945 to 1952 in&nbsp; the&nbsp; total amount of Pl,989.27, as well as the real estate taxes for the years 1953 and 1954 in the&nbsp; annual sum of P295.80.<br><br>On&nbsp; October&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 1952, Rosario&nbsp; Grey Vda.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Albar, et ah commenced the present action to settle the dispute and conflicting views&nbsp; entertained&nbsp; by the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; in&nbsp; line&nbsp; with their agreement and&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that judgment&nbsp; be rendered declaring&nbsp; that&nbsp; the usufruct&nbsp; in favor of Josefa Fabie is now&nbsp; only limited&nbsp; to&nbsp; receiving the legal&nbsp; interest&nbsp; on the value of the land, and that her right to receive any rental under the contract entered into between the parties has already&nbsp; ceased.<br><br>On August 10,&nbsp; 1953, the trial court rendered judgment the dispositive part of which reads:<br><blockquote>"EN VIRTUD DE&nbsp; TODO LO CUAL,&nbsp; el Juzgado promulga&nbsp; decisi6n a favor de la demandada usufructuaria, declarando:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) Que su usufructo vitalicio continua sobre la finca en Ongpin con&nbsp; derecho exclusivo de&nbsp; percibir&nbsp; durante&nbsp; su&nbsp; vida&nbsp; la&nbsp; totalidad de sus rentas, sin que&nbsp; los demandantes&nbsp; tengan&nbsp; derecho&nbsp; de inmiscuirse en la administracion de dicha finca;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) Con derecho&nbsp; de percibir el 6%&nbsp; de la&nbsp; cantidad&nbsp; de&nbsp; P8,574.00 percibidos como indemnizacion&nbsp; de guerra&nbsp; desde Enero 11, 1950;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) Al&nbsp; reembolso de&nbsp; la suma die&nbsp; Pl,989.27 pagados o&nbsp; abonados por la demandada como&nbsp; pagos&nbsp; del&nbsp; amillaramiento desde&nbsp; la&nbsp; fecha de la Contestacion,&nbsp; Octubre 22,&nbsp; 1953;<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) Mas la suma de P2,000.00 como&nbsp; danos y perjuicios en forma de honorarios de abogado y gastos de litigio.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) Con las costas&nbsp; a cargo de los demandantes."<br></blockquote>On appeal by plaintiffs, the Court of Appeals modified the decision as follows:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore, we hereby affirm the decision appealed from&nbsp; in&nbsp; so far as it holds that appellee's&nbsp; right of life usufruct&nbsp; subsists and is&nbsp; in&nbsp; full force and effect upon the Ongpin lot and&nbsp; the building now existing thereon, and that&nbsp; she&nbsp; is entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive from appellants the legal&nbsp; interest or&nbsp; 6%&nbsp; interest per annum of the amount of P3,272.00 from the time it was actually received from the Philippine War Damage Commission for the whole period&nbsp; of the usufruct, and&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; are hereby required&nbsp; to give&nbsp; sufficient security for the&nbsp; payment of such interest, and&nbsp; we hereby&nbsp; reverse said decision, declaring: that reimbursement to appellee of the sum of Pl,987.27 paid by her for real estate taxes is deffered until the termination&nbsp; of the usufruct,&nbsp; and that she is not entitled&nbsp; to any amount for attorney's fees.&nbsp; Without pronouncement regarding costs."<br></blockquote>Plaintiffs interposed the present petition for review.<br><br>The main&nbsp; issue&nbsp; to&nbsp; be determined&nbsp; fringes on&nbsp; the interpretation of that&nbsp; portion of&nbsp; the will&nbsp; which devises&nbsp; to Josefa Fabie all the&nbsp; rentals&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property situated&nbsp; in Ongpin and&nbsp; Sto.&nbsp; Cristo&nbsp; Streets, City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; The pertinent provision of the&nbsp; will reads: "Lego a mi ahijada menor de edad Maria Josefa de la Paz Fabie, en usufmcto vitalicio las rentas de las tineas situadas&nbsp; en la calle Santo Cristo *&nbsp; * * y en la&nbsp; calle Ongpin,&nbsp; Numeros 950 al 956 del Distrito de Santa Cruz, Manila."&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners contend that this provision of the will should be interpreted&nbsp; as constituting only a life usufruct on the rentals&nbsp; of the buildings erected on&nbsp; the&nbsp; lands and that&nbsp; once these buildings are&nbsp; destroyed the&nbsp; sufruct is extinguished.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent, on the other hand, contends that that provision should be interpreted as constituting a life&nbsp; usufruct both&nbsp; on the buildings and&nbsp; the lands because the&nbsp; former cannot&nbsp; be separated from the latter.<br><br>In Lopez <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Constantino, 74&nbsp; Phil., 160, we said: <br><blockquote>"It may indeed seem&nbsp; at first blush that the rents out of which the pension&nbsp; was&nbsp; payable were earned by&nbsp; or&nbsp; paid&nbsp; for the building only, independently of the lot on which it was erected;&nbsp; but&nbsp; further reflection will show that such impression is&nbsp; wrong.&nbsp; When both land and building belong to the same owner, as in&nbsp; this case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; rents on the building&nbsp; constitute an earning of&nbsp; the&nbsp; capital&nbsp; invested&nbsp; in the acquisition of both land and building. There can be&nbsp; a land without a&nbsp; building, <span style="font-style: italic;">but there can be no building&nbsp; without land. The land, being an indispensable part of the rented premises&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be considered as having no rental value whatsoever."</span>&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>In another part&nbsp; of the decision, this&nbsp; Court said:&nbsp; "Since appellant's participation in the rents of the leased premises by way of life pension was part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of the sale, it cannot be deemed extinguished so long as she lives and so long as the land exists, <i>because that land may be rented to anyone who may desire to erred a building thereon,</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br><br>From the above,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; clear that when&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased constituted the life usufruct on the rentals of the&nbsp; "fincas situadas" in Ongpin and Sto.&nbsp; Cristo streets, she meant to impose the encumbrance both on the building and the land on which it is erected for indeed the building cannot exist without the land.&nbsp; And as.this Court well said, 'The land, being an indispensable part of the rented premises cannot be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as having&nbsp; no&nbsp; rental value&nbsp; whatsoever." Moreover, in the Spanish language, the term "fincas" has a broad scope;&nbsp; it includes not only building but&nbsp; land as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Diccionario Ingles-Español, por Martines Amador) Since only the building was&nbsp; destroyed and the&nbsp; usufruct is&nbsp; constituted not only on the building but&nbsp; on&nbsp; the land as well, then the usufruct&nbsp; is not deemed extinguished by the destruction of the building for under the law usufruct is&nbsp; extinguished only by the <i>total loss</i> of the thing subject of the encumbrance&nbsp; (Article 603, old Civil&nbsp; Code). <br><br>In our opinion, this case comes under Article 517 of the same Code which provides: "If the usufruct is constituted on immovable property of which a building forms&nbsp; part, and the latter should be destroyed in any&nbsp; manner&nbsp; whatsoever, the&nbsp; usufructuary shall have a right to make use of the land and materials."&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a&nbsp; temporary&nbsp; measure calculated to maintain the usufruct alive until the very thing that has been destroyed be reconstructed or replaced. The&nbsp; reason is&nbsp; obvious: since the usufruct has not&nbsp; been extinguished by&nbsp; the destruction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; building and the usufruct is for life as in this case, it is but fair that the usufructuary continue&nbsp; to enjoy the use of&nbsp; the land&nbsp; and the materials that may&nbsp; have been left by the fire or to the use of the new&nbsp; building that may be constructed&nbsp; on the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; hold&nbsp; otherwise&nbsp; would&nbsp; be to&nbsp; affirm&nbsp; that the usufruct has been extinguished.<br><br>The question that now arises is:&nbsp; Who is called upon to undertake the new construction, and at whose cost?&nbsp; Of course, this is addressed to the wisdom and&nbsp; discretion of the usufructuary who, to all intents and purposes is deemed as the&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been clarified in the case of Fabie <i>vs.</i> Gutierrez&nbsp; David,&nbsp; 75 Phil., 536,&nbsp; which was litigated between&nbsp; the&nbsp; same parties and wherein the scope of the same provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; will&nbsp; has been the subject of interpretation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is what this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"Construing said judgment in the light&nbsp; of&nbsp; the ninth&nbsp; clause of the will of the deceased&nbsp; Rosario Fabie&nbsp; y Grey,&nbsp; which was quoted in the decision and by which Josefa Fabie was made the usufructuary during her lifetime of the income of the property in question, we find that the said usufructuary&nbsp; has the right to&nbsp; administer the property in question.&nbsp; All the acts of administration—to&nbsp; collect the rents for&nbsp; herself,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to conserve the property&nbsp; by making all necessary repair and paying&nbsp; all the&nbsp; taxes,&nbsp; special&nbsp; assessments, and insurance premiums thereon—were by said judgment vested in the usufructuary.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pretension of the respondent Juan&nbsp; Grey that he is the administrator of the&nbsp; property with the right&nbsp; to choose the tenants and to dictate the&nbsp; conditions of the lease is contrary to both&nbsp; the&nbsp; letter&nbsp; and spirit of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; clause of the will, the stipulation of the parties,&nbsp; and the judgment of the court. He cannot manage&nbsp; or administer the property&nbsp; after all the acts of management or administration have been vested by the court, with his consent,&nbsp; in the usufructuary."<br></blockquote>In the instant case,&nbsp; however, a happy compromise was reached by the parties in view of the offer of one&nbsp; Chinaman to lease the land for five years and to construct thereon a building worth&nbsp; P30,000.00&nbsp; upon the condition that upon its completion the building would become an integral part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land on which it is erected.&nbsp; This means that its naked ownership&nbsp; should belong to petitioners and its beneficial&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; to respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;&nbsp; is a&nbsp; happy medium which fits into the purpose&nbsp; contemplated in Article 517 above referred to:&nbsp; that the usufruct should&nbsp; continue on the&nbsp; land and the&nbsp; new improvement that may be constructed thereon.<br><br>We therefore hold that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals did not err in finding that&nbsp; appellee's right of usufruct subsists and is in full&nbsp; force and effect&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; Ongpin lot and the building existing thereon, affirming the decision of the trial court.<br><br>Petitioners' contention that the Court of Appeals&nbsp; erred in ruling that the damages paid by the War Damage Commission to said petitioners was&nbsp; intended to be an indemnity for the&nbsp; destruction of the building in question and in ordering them to pay respondent 6% interest per annum on the amount&nbsp; of the damage paid is&nbsp; also untenable, for it cannot be denied that a war damage&nbsp; payment&nbsp; is intended to replace&nbsp; part of the capital invested in the building destroyed or to assuage somewhat the&nbsp; material loss of its owner.&nbsp; It cannot be maintained that war damage payments are intended to be a mere gesture of appreciation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the people&nbsp; of the United States of America towards our people for it is a well-known fact that countless of our countrymen who suffered in the last war or whose kin-folks lost their lives did not receive any war damage payment because they&nbsp; have no&nbsp; damaged&nbsp; property that could be indemnified.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruling that 6%&nbsp; interest per annum&nbsp; of such&nbsp; war&nbsp; damage&nbsp; payment&nbsp; should&nbsp; be paid to respondent&nbsp; from the time it was&nbsp; actually&nbsp; received to the end of the life of the usufruct should, in my opinion, be modified in the sense that that obligation should only be valid up to the date the new building was&nbsp; constructed by the Chinaman who leased the property upon the theory that the amount of damage paid by the War Damage Commission&nbsp; which was intended to replace the old building has in turn been replaced by the new.&nbsp; However, the majority is of the opinion that the same&nbsp; should also be subject to usufruct for life because it has not been used in&nbsp; the construction of the new building, although they suggested the alternative that the naked owners may turn over the money to the usufructuary so that she may use it&nbsp; during her lifetime&nbsp; subject to its return to them after&nbsp; her death if they desire to be relieved of this encumbrance.<br><br>We&nbsp; find, however, merit in the contention&nbsp; that the real estate&nbsp; taxes paid by respondent&nbsp; in her capacity as usufructuary&nbsp; for&nbsp; several years previous to the present litigation should be paid by her, as she did, instead of by petitioners not only because she is the only&nbsp; recipient of all the benefits of the property but because she bound herself to pay such taxes&nbsp; in a formal agreement approved&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; in Civil&nbsp; Case No. 1659&nbsp; oi;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Manila (Fabie <i>vs.</i> Gutierrez David, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, which involved&nbsp; the same parties and&nbsp; the same properties subject of&nbsp; usufruct,&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; an&nbsp; amicable agreement which was approved by&nbsp; the court wherein the usufructuary, herein respondent, bound herself to pay all the real estate taxes, special assessment&nbsp; and insurance premiums, and make all the necessary repairs on each&nbsp; of the properties covered by the usufruct and in accordance with said agreement,&nbsp; respondent paid&nbsp; all the taxes for the years&nbsp; 1945 to 1954.&nbsp; In said agreement,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; also stipulated that the same&nbsp; "shall be&nbsp; in&nbsp; effect&nbsp; during the term of&nbsp; the usufruct and&nbsp; shall be binding on&nbsp; the successors and assigns&nbsp; of&nbsp; each of the parties."&nbsp; There is&nbsp; therefore no&nbsp; valid reason why petitioners should now be ordered&nbsp; to reimburse&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; for all the real taxes she had paid on the property.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; respect, the decision of the Court of Appeals should be modified.<br><br>Wherefore, with the modification that petitioners should not be made to reimburse the&nbsp; real estate&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; paid&nbsp; by the respondent for the years abovementioned, the decision appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed in all&nbsp; other respects, without pronouncement as to costs. <br><br><i>Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><b><center>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</center></b><br><b>MONTEMAYOR, J.: </b><br><br>I concur in the learned opinion of the majority, penned by Mr. Justice Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; with the exception of that portion thereof on page 10, which holds that the payment to the usufructuary of the 6% interest per annum of the war damage payment should end on the date of the&nbsp; construction of the new building by the Chinaman who leased the property, from which ruling&nbsp; I dissent.<br><br>It will be noticed&nbsp; that both the trial&nbsp; court and the Court&nbsp; of Appeals were&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opinion that said payment of interest should continue during the lifetime of the&nbsp; usufruct.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; agree to said opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason is obvious. The war damage payment is the equivalent of&nbsp; the building destroyed.&nbsp; Since the usufructuary had a right to the use or&nbsp; the fruits of the&nbsp; building,&nbsp; she therefore had the right&nbsp; to the interest on the war damage payment during her lifetime.&nbsp; In my opinion, the construction of the&nbsp; new building does not relieve&nbsp; the owners of the land who received the war damage payment from continuing the payment&nbsp; of interest.&nbsp; Had&nbsp; said owners of the land used the war damage payment to construct the building,&nbsp; then&nbsp; they would&nbsp; be&nbsp; free from paying interest because the rent of the new building would correspond to the&nbsp; interest on the war damage payment.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the fact&nbsp; is the new building was not constructed by the owners of the land, but by the Chinese lessee.<br><br>The majority opinion states that the usufructuary would then be receiving&nbsp; the interest on&nbsp; the war damage payment and&nbsp; also the rent of&nbsp; the new building—a sort of double benefit, which is said to be unfair.&nbsp; That is&nbsp; one view. The other view is that at the end of the usufruct, the owners of the land or their&nbsp; heirs shall have received not only equivalent or value of the old building destroyed, in the form of the war damage payment&nbsp; but also&nbsp; the new building constructed absolutely at no cost or expense to them— also a&nbsp; double benefit, which might also be&nbsp; regarded as unfair following the point of view of the majority opinion. So, in this&nbsp; respect of double benefit, both parties stand on the same footing.&nbsp; Viewed thus, there is nothing unfair in the arrangement.<br><br>Furthermore, we should not lose sight of&nbsp; the fact that the usufructuary, as the majority opinion well states&nbsp; has a right&nbsp; to the use and the fruits not only of the improvements, such as buildings on the land, but of the&nbsp; land itself.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; anything built on the land would be subject&nbsp; to the usufruct,&nbsp; and the fruits thereof,&nbsp; such as rents, would go to the usufructuary.&nbsp; This&nbsp; naturally&nbsp; includes the interest on the&nbsp; war damage payment for the old building destroyed during the war, which payment is the equivalent of said building.&nbsp; Had the owners of the land used the amount of said payment to construct another building on the land,&nbsp; or should they have used the sum to add&nbsp; another story or&nbsp; extension of&nbsp; the&nbsp; building constructed thereon by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chinese lessee, there would surely be no question that any rent therefrom would belong to the usufructuary, because then it&nbsp; could&nbsp; be regarded as improvement&nbsp; on the land, which, as already said, is&nbsp; the equivalent or a&nbsp; reproduction of said old building.&nbsp; Just because the owners of the land kept said war damage payment for their own use did not relieve them of the obligation&nbsp; of paying the interest on the same to the&nbsp; usufructuary, because otherwise, they would be having&nbsp; not&nbsp; only the naked&nbsp; ownership of the equivalent of&nbsp; said building, but also its fruits.<br><br>The&nbsp; foregoing are some of the reasons for my dissent.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, </i>and <i>Concepcion, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">REYES, J. B. L., J.:</span><br><br>I concur in the opinion of Justice Montemayor, specially because the usufructuary receives only&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">a part </span>of the rent of the&nbsp; new building.<br></div>
