				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime in  August,  1948, the former Rural Progress Administration  acquired a big  parcel  of land  known as Tuason  Estate  No.  2 situated in  Sampaloc, Manila,  for resale to occupants thereof.  Subsequently,  the  possession and administration  thereof were transferred  to "Ang Buhay,  Inc.," a non-stock corporation, which undertook the  survey and subdivision thereof into home  lots. The corresponding  survey plan of the subdivision, to wit: Psd-24819, was duly approved by the  Bureau  of Lands after it had been submitted to, and approved as to layout by, the Adviser to  the President on  Planning (par. V of the  petition  and Exhibit 1).  By virtue of  the  provisions of  Executive  Order  No. 376, dated November 28, 1950, the Rural Progress Administration was abolished and all its properties, assets, rights, etc. were transferred to, and its obligation assumed by the Landed Estates Division of the Bureau of Lands. <br><br>Petitioner and appellee, who purchased lot 3, Block 3, of the said subdivision on installment basis,  filed  on May 13, 1953  an application with  respondent and  appellant City Engineer for a temporary building permit to construct a  strong  material  house  thereon  (paragraph  2, Partial Stipulation  of Facts).  The lot in question does  not abut on any street, public or  private, but  only on a proposed street  shown  on the plan  (Exhibit 1).  Petitioner and appellee's application, however, bears the conformity of the chief of the Landed Estates  Division of the Bureau of Lands who placed thereon a note reading: "The street along  this lot  will be constructed  as  soon  as funds  for the purpose is made available."   (Exhibit 2.) <br><br>Previous  to the application of petitioner and  appellee, the city authorities had  issued several temporary building permits for the  construction of houses  on  other lots of the subdivision abutting  only  on  proposed roads with assurance of the Director of Lands that the proposed roads would  be constructed as soon as funds were available.   Up to the present,  said roads  has not been constructed as promised,   (paragraphs  3  and  6,  Partial Stipulation of Facts).<br><br>Respondent and appellant City Engineer forwarded petitioner and appellee's application to  respondent and appellant City Mayor, stating among others, that  "in view of the herein compromise of the  Chief,  Landed Estates Division, in behalf of the Bureau of  Lands,  to the effect that the  streets,  curves,  gutters,  drainage, etc.  in  this subdivision will be constructed as soon as funds for  the purpose  is  available * * *, this office  would  interpose no  objection  to  the granting  of a  temporary  building permit in  favor of Mr. Manzano."  And under  date of October 31, 1955 respondent and appellant City Engineer accordingly notified petitioner and  appellee stating, among others, the following: "With reference to your application for  building permit for the  construction  of  a strong material building on lot 3, Block 3,  Ang Buhay Suddivision, Sampaloc, I regret  to  inform you  that his  Honor,  the Mayor, has disapproved the same in view of the provisions of paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>), Section 8, of Executive Order No.  98, series of 1946  *  * *."   Consequently, petitioner and  appellee filed this petition for mandamus. <br><br>In answer to the  petition,  it was also alleged as  additional affirmative defense that section 103 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila requires as a prerequisite to the issuance of a building  permit "that the building shall abut or face upon  a  public  street or alley or on  a private street or alley which has been officially approved." The lower court  ruled  that both, the ground for the disapproval  of petitioner  and  appellee's  application  for building  permit based  upon  the provisions of paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>),  section 8 of Executive Order No. 98, series of  1946, and  the  additional  special defense set up  in  behalf of respondents and  appellants   based  on  section  103  of Ordinance  1600,  otherwise known as the  Revised  Ordinances of the City of Manila, are not well taken and commanded respondents and  appellants forthwith to issue the building permit applied for by the petitioner and appellee. <br><br>From the  decision  the respondent has appealed, assigning the  following errors: <br><blockquote>"The lower court erred in holding that respondents and appellants' ground for the disapproval of petitioner and appellee's application for building permit based on  the  provisions of paragraph  (d), Section  8  of Executive Order No. 98,  series of 1946,  is not  well taken. <br><br>The lower court erred in holding that the additional defense set up in behalf of respondents and appellants based on the provisions of Section 103 of Ordinance  No. 1600,  known  as the Revised Ordinance of the City  of Manila is likewise  not well taken. <br><br>The lower court erred in commanding respondents and appellants forthwith to issue the building permit applied for by petitioner and appellee."</blockquote> As we see it, the only issue is whether or not the appellee Manzano  (petitioner below) has complied with the  requisites  of paragraph  (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>), section 8 of Executive Order No. 98,  series of 1946 (42 Off. Gaz., 425), and  section 103  of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila.  Said legal provisions read as follows:<br><blockquote>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) From and after the time when any such subdivision  regulations are in effect no  building  permit  shall be issued  for  or  no building shall be erected on any lot within the land area affected by  such subdivision regulations  unless the street  giving access to the lot upon which said  building is proposed to be  placed (1)  shall have been accepted or opened as, or  shall have otherwise received the  legal status of,  a  public  street  prior  to that  time or (2) corresponds in its  location  and  lines with a street shown  on  a subdivision plan approved  by the said  Administrative Agency  or  (3) corresponds with a street duly located or accepted by the legislative body having jurisdiction over the area affected  by  such  division regulations.  Any building erected or to be erected in violation of this  section shall be deemed an unlawful structure  and an ejection, removal or  injunction proceeding may be  brought  by the said Administrative Agency to enjoin  such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed."  (Sec. 8, Executive Order No. 98,  series  1946) <br><br>"Sec. 103. <span style="font-style: italic;">Issuance</span>.—When the application,  plans, and specifications conform to the requirements of this  title  and of title thirteen hereof, the  city engineer shall  issue a  permit  for the  erection of the building and shall approve in writing such  plans and specifications, one copy of which  shall be returned to the owner or his agent and  one copy shall be retained by the city engineer: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided</span>, That the building shall abut  or face upon a public street or alley or  on a private street or alley which has  been  officially  approved;  <span style="font-style: italic;">And provided, further,</span> That  any  private street or  alley opened  in  an interior lot for the purposes of this section, once officially approved, shall be open to the general  public, and  with  its approved  width preserved shall be maintained and kept in good repair by the grantee of the  permit, his heirs,  executors,  and  assigns,  and shall  never be closed by any  person so  long as there is  a building or other structure abutting  or  facing upon  such  private  street  or  alley." (Sec.  103, Revised Ordinances)</blockquote>Regarding the first provision  (Exec. Order No. 98), the court below sustained  appellee  Manzano's argument that the  approval of  the plan Exhibit  1 by  Mr. Louis Croft, Presidential Adviser  on Planning, sufficed  to place  his case within subdivision (2) of paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)  of section 8, since "the street giving access  to the lot upon which said building is proposed  to be  placed—(2) corresponds in its location and  lines with a  street shown on a subdivision plan  approved  by the said administrative agency."  We believe the claim to  be  untenable.  The  "administrative agency" referred to can be no other than that referred to in the preceding paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)  of section 8  of the same Executive Order, reading: <br><blockquote>"(b) From and after  the time when any such subdivision regulations  are in effect, then no plat or subdivision  shall be  filed for record or recorded, no buildings shall be erected, no land sold, leased or contracted to be sold or leased, and no permit issued until such plat or subdivision shall have been approved  by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Administrative Agency designated by the Commission to administer the same</span> and such approval endorsed in writing on the plate or  subdivision."  (42 Off. Gaz., 431) (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote> It  has not been proved  that Mr. Croft was "the Administrative Agency" designated by the (Urban Planning) Commission to administer its subdivision regulations; and as it  is not asserted  that the petitioner's case falls within any  of  the other  cases envisaged in  section 8  of the Executive Order  No. 98,  respondent  Manzano has not legally  complied with its conditions so as to  entitle him to the  issuance  of the building  permit. <br><br>More  important is the  objection raised  by appellant City  Mayor, based on section 103 of  the  Manila  Revised Ordinances.   The trial court again upheld the respondent Manzano on this point, saying— <br><blockquote>"On the other hand, it is admitted that the proposed building abuts or faces  upon  a  street,  as this  term is commonly understood to mean  an area  set apart and designated as  public  way from  side to side and from end to  end, which the general public has the right to use as  such,  although  said  street, which has  been  officially approved as to lay out is not yet constructed."  (Appellant's Brief, p. 18)</blockquote> But,  as argued for appellant  City  Mayor,  section 103 could only apply  to  streets  and  alleys duly  constructed, and  it is not  enough that an area be set aside for them. It will be noticed that the last proviso requires that any such private alley "be <span style="font-style: italic;">maintained</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">kept in good repair</span> by the grantee",  a requirement that would have no reason to exist if the alley were merely an open transitable area, without paving,  drains or gutters; the obvious  purpose of the requirements being to ensure the safety and health of the residents  within the area.<br><br>If the Mayor  is competed to grant a building permit in the present case, he  may not thereafter refuse it to other applicants  similarly situated.  Houses  would then multiply in the  area,  without any drainage  or  sanitary facilities,  and constitute  a source of infection  that  would menace the rest of the city dwellers.  As the appellant puts it: "If houses in a subdivision like the one in question, with only proposed streets, proposed drains, and proposed gutters,  are  allowed to  be  constructed, dirty  stagnant water would easily accumulate therein and the place would soon become  filthy,  obnoxious  and dangerous to  public health."  This consideration is decisive.  It is well known that slum districts  are  the  bane of modern  cities, and we are not disposed  to sanction any action that would, in the  long run, add to  the sores that already  plague  the City of Manila, and  increase the danger  to the health of its inhabitants. <br><br>The petitioner and  appellee stresses the fact that the respondent Mayor has issued temporary permits  to build in the  same  subdivision.  That is not  sufficient ground to compel  him to issue another.  The Mayor  could have been willing  to  issue  the previous permits relying upon the  promise that the streets would be constructed by the Government as subdivision owner, until the continual delay in their construction posed the probability of  a slum area coming into  existence if  such  permits  were  continued. The lower court' itself noted in its decision that— <br><blockquote>"experience teaches us that promises of well-intentional officials who are ready and willing to perform the same  cannot be compelled due to circumstances beyond  their  control,  such  as  unavailability  of funds."</blockquote>Surely in view  of such  experience the Mayor can not be blamed for refusing to  trust any further  mere promises of street construction  by the Bureau of Lands authorities, and insisting instead upon actual  performance  of such promises  before issuing further  permits.   At any rate, the previous illegal  issuance of permits  would not in any way justify compelling  the Mayor  to embark in further illegality.<br><br>We understand of course that the strict application of sec.  103 of the Ordinances  imposes hardship upon the appellee, and limits  to some extent his proprietary  rights over the lot in question.  It has always  been understood, however, that every piece of property and every property right is held subject to reasonable state regulation, to the end that its use shall not be injurious  to the health and  welfare of  the  community.  The appellee must have so understood when, in his contract of purchase, he agreed to abide by any rules and regulations "regarding the opening of widening of  streets, sanitation and so forth." <br><br>Not having established an  undoubted and clear  legal right, petitioner  Manzano has failed to make a case for the issuance of a writ of mandamus. <br><br>Wherefore,  the order appealed  from  is  reversed  and the petition ordered dismissed, with costs against petitioner.  So ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING</span><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FELIX</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">J</span>.,  <br><br>The use of  the consecrated formula of I DISSENT, even in bold capital letters  for emphasis, may perhaps  indicate the calmness,  equanimity and  countenance that a magistrate  must show in passing judgment;  so  I declare that I dissent from  the majority decision  rendered  in  this case.  This cool expression, however, does not by any means reflect the profound abhorrence and detestation I feel for <span style="font-style: italic;">the effects</span>  thereof, for they shock every fibre  of my conscience and impishly hurt my sense of justice. <br><br>In  every  case that is submitted to Our consideration and determination, We have the sacred duty of construing the law  applicable to the controversy,  and in  doing  so, We must have in mind the very words of  our Civil Code which says, that: <br><blockquote>"Art. 10. In case of doubt in ,the interpretation or  application of laws, it is presumed that the law-making body intended right and justice  to prevail".</blockquote>and it could not  be  otherwise because laws are enacted to protect rights and to do  justice.  Under the influence of this provision, let us now examine whether in the case at bar the majority of this Court had in mind this salutary principle of statutory  construction. <br><br>The facts of the case had been stipulated by the parties and are properly narrated in the majority decision. They may be given in a nutshell as follows: Victoriano Manzano must  have been an occupant  of the lot involved herein, located in the parcel of land known as Tuason Estate No. 2 in Sampaloc, Manila.  This parcel of land was acquired by the former Rural Progress Administration <span style="font-style: italic;">for resale to the occupants thereof.</span>  Subsequently, the possession and administration of  said  estate was  transferred to  "Ang Buhay, Inc.",  a non-stock corporation which  undertook the survey  and  subdivision thereof into home-lots (See subdivision  plan Psd-24819 duly approved  by  the Bureau of Lands after it had been submitted to and approved as to lay-out by the Adviser to the President on planning— Exhibit  1). <br><br>The Rural  Progress Administration was abolished by Executive Order No. 376 dated November 28, 1950, and all its properties, rights, etc., were transferred to and its obligations  assumed  by the Landed Estates Division of the Bureau  of  Lands.   Victoriano  Manzano who had purchased Lot  3,  Block III of the said subdivision,  on  installment basis, filed on May 13, 1953, an application with the City Engineer of Manila, Alejo Aquino, for a <span style="font-style: italic;">temporary</span> permit to construct a house of strong materials thereon and although  the  lot  in  question  does  not  abut  on any street, public or private, but only on a <span style="font-style: italic;">proposed</span> street appearing in the subdivision plan Exhibit 1, <span style="font-style: italic;">said application bears the conformity  of the  Chief of the Landed Estates Division of the Bureau of Lands</span> (the vendor) who certified  that: "a street  along this  lot will be  constructed as  soon  as funds for  the  purpose  is made  available" (Exhibit 2). <br><br>It is to  be  recalled at this juncture that up  to about a month previous  to  the  aforementioned application of Manzano, the  City authorities  had issued  several <span style="font-style: italic;">temporary</span> building permits for the construction of houses on other lots of the same subdivision abutting only on proposed roads with the same assurance of the Director  of Lands that the <span style="font-style: italic;">proposed</span>  road  would be constructed as soon as the funds were made available, though that promise apparently  failed to materialize up to the present. <br><br>On the  strength of  these precedents  City  Engineer Aquino endorsed  Manzano's application for  a  building permit stating that "in view of the herein compromise of the Chief,  Landed  Estates Division, in  behalf of the Bureau of Lands,  to  the  effect that the streets,  curbs, gutters,  drainage,  etc.,  in  this subdivision  will be constructed  as soon as funds  for the purpose  is  available, * * * this office  would interpose no objection to the granting of the temporary building  permit in favor of Mr. Manzano".  But the Mayor of the City of Manila saw it fit to  disregard the recommendation of  the  City Engineer and the assurance given by the  Chief of the Landed Estates Division  and on October 31,  1955,  the  City Engineer notified the petitioner that  "with  reference to the application for building permit for the construction of a strong material building on Lot 3, Block 3, Ang Buhay subdivision, Sampaloc,  Manila, I  regret to inform you that his Honor, the Mayor, has disapproved the same in view of the provisions of paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>),  Section 8, of Executive Order No. 98, series  of  1947 *  *  *". <br><br>Making the picture of Manzano's plight more pointedly, I  may  say, in synthesis, that the petitioner <br><blockquote>(who is undoubtedly living in a sort of a hut or barong-barong on the lot which he  had  purchased on installments from the Government and has complied with <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> his  obligations in connection with the said purchase  of the  lot he is occupying, and who had every reason  to  rely on the sale made by the Government  which, incidentally, acquired said parcel of land precisely for the purpose of subdividing and reselling the same to the occupants thereof in order to allow the latter to improve their place of abode by making it more decent and fit for human habitation)</blockquote> could not attain this goal  simply because the vendor, the National  Government, has failed to fulfill its promise to construct and provide the streets,  mentioned in the subdivision plan and because  the City of Manila, a political subdivision of  the  <span style="font-style: italic;">National Government,</span> has deemed it wise  to  pick  on the  petitioner  and  use  him  as  the Archimedes' lever to impel the  Bureau of Lands to construct the  <span style="font-style: italic;">proposed</span> roads  indicated in  said estate subdivision plan.  It will not be  amiss to advert in this connection  that the construction of  Manzano's  building, as  proposed in his application for  temporary building permit, would not add an iota of risk or danger to public health or safety  (which Sec. 8, paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) of Executive Order No. 98, s. 1947—and the  Ordinances of the City of Manila invoked  by  the City authorities were  undoubtedly intended to prevent), because Manzano must actually have a  hut on  said lot, as otherwise  he  could not have bought such  property.   It  seems, therefore, obvious that what he wants is merely to improve his living  conditions by erecting a more suitable home.   Unluckily,  however, that is  not  the  way  the  respondent Mayor looks  at Manzano's petition who can see to his great discontent and discomfiture that his neighbors have been granted a permit that was denied to him. <br><br>As a consequence of the Mayor's refusal  to grant said temporary building permit,  the matter was taken  to the Court of First Instance of Manila where, after proper proceedings, decision was rendered for the petitioner. <br><br>In  this  instance,  the  whole issue revolves upon  the question of whether or not the aforementioned provisions of Executive Order No. 98 and of Section 103 of Ordinance No.  1600  (Revised Ordinances of the City of Manila), sustain the attitude of the  City Mayor  in denying the application  for the  issuance  of the temporary  building permit sought for by petitioner Victoriano  Manzano. <br><br>There is no controversy that at the time  the instant action  was commenced,  the construction of the  streets, gutters, drainage, etc., of the subdivision  involved  herein were not yet  undertaken by  the vendor, the Government, although, as above  stated, it was  certified  by the Chief, Landed Estates  Division of  the Bureau of  Lands,  the agency in  charge of the  sale and distribution of the lots therein, that  said works  will  be started  as soon as the funds  therefore  were   made   available.   The  majority Opinion, in ruling  that  Manzano  failed to comply  with the requisites  of  paragraph  (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>), Section  8 of Executive Order No.  98,  declares that  while the subdivision plan, Exhibit 1,  was approved  by Mr. Louis Croft, Presidential Adviser on Planning  on  September 16, 1948, it  was not proved that the said Mr. Croft is the "administrative agency" designated by the (Urban Planning) Commission to administer its subdivision regulations, which  can be  no other than that referred to in paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) of the same section. The aforecited  paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>),  Section  8,  of Executive Order No. 98, reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">From and after the time when any suck subdivision regulations are in effect</span>, then  no  plat or subdivision  shall  be filed for record or recorded, no buildings shall be erected, no  land sold, leased or contracted to be sold or leased, and no permit issued until such plat or subdivision shall have been approved by the <span style="font-style: italic;">Administrative Agency designated by the Commission to administer the  same</span> and approval endorsed in  writing on  the plat or  subdivision.",</blockquote> while the  pertinent  portion,  of the  oft-cited  paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>),  Section 8 of the same executive order, prescribes the following:<br><blockquote>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">From and after the time when any such subdivision regulations are in effect</span> no building permit shall be issued for or no building shall be  erected  on  any lot within the land area affected by such subdivision regulations unless the street giving access to the lot  upon which  said building is proposed  to be placed (1)  shall have been accepted or opened as,  or shall have  otherwise received the legal status  of, a public street prior to that time or (2)  corresponds in  its location  and lines  with a <span style="font-style: italic;">street shown on a  subdivision plan approved by  the  said Admimstrative Agency</span> or  (3) corresponds with a street duly located or accepted by the legislative body  having  jurisdiction over  the area affected by such  division regulations. * * *" (Exec. Order No. 98,  series  of 1946).</blockquote>I emphasize the opening sentences of the  aforequoted provisions relied upon by the Majority Opinion because, it  may be noted, they are  both contingent upon  one condition, i.e., "from and  after the  time  when any such subdivision  regulations  are in  effect". <br><br>In virtue of Executive  Order No. 98,  series  of  1946, which  authorized  and   empowered  the National  Urban Planning Commission to make and adopt or cause  to be made and  adopted "regulations which  shall  govern  the subdivision of land in urban area or part thereof" (Section 3-b (3), Exec. Order No. 98), the said Commission issued its  Subdivision Regulations which was  published in  the June, 1949 issue of the Official Gazette (45  Off. Gaz.  No. 6, 2417)  and  contain  the following provision:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">From and  after the date of adoption</span>, these regulations shall  govern  all subdivisions of land in the Philippines intended for residential,  commercial and industrial purposes in any urban area or part thereof".</blockquote>And  in providing  for the date of  its  effectivity, the same body of regulations prescribes:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 21. These regulations shall  take effect <span style="font-style: italic;">sixty</span>  (60) <span style="font-style: italic;">days after their publication</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">in the Official Gazette.</span>  Their application, however, to specific urban areas shall take effect  thirty (30)  days after  they <span style="font-style: italic;">have been filed with the corresponding city or municipal board</span>, unless modified or disapproved by the three-fourths (3/4)  vote of said board or council within  that period".</blockquote>Accordingly, on July 21, 1950, the Municipal Board of the City of  Manila  passed  and approved the  aforesaid subdivision regulations as recommended by the City Mayor. through the City Engineer (Appendix B, appellants' brief). Thus, pursuant to Section 21 thereof, the  said subdivision regulations took effect in the City of Manila 30 days after July 21, 1950,  or on August 20,  1950, and it must be pointed out in this connection that  as early as September 16, 1948, the subdivision plan involved  herein was already approved by the  Presidential  Adviser  on Planning.  The question now is what  was  the effect  or weight of such approval ?<br><br>Prior  to the  issuance of the subdivision regulations providing for those  requirements before a building could be  issued, Executive Order No. 98 created  the National Urban Planning Commission intended, as previously stated, to prepare general plans, zoning ordinances and subdivision  regulations,  to guide and accomplish a coordinated,  adjusted, harmonious reconstruction and  future development of urban areas, and bestowed all such powers as may be necessary to  enable it to perform its purposes and promote  urban  planning.  The Commission is composed of a Director of Planning as chairman and 5 members to  be  appointed  by the President with  the consent of the  Commission on  Appointments, who  shall  be under the direct control and supervision of the President.  And for this purpose,  the  President  may  designate  any of his technical advisers or officials of the executive  department to  act as  adviser  of the Commission.   (Sec. 2 Ex. Ord. No. 98).  Even a detailed examination  of Executive Order  No. 98 would not yield any provision that would show  on whom  the duty  to  approve  plans submitted to  said  Commission falls,  and  considering  that the authority of Louis P. Croft, as  the Presidential Adviser on Planning to approve said plans  before the effectivity of the subdivision regulations was not assailed, and taking into  account that such  official act was valid at the time of its execution, same must be  respected  and those  who have complied  with the requirements under the  law then in force should not be prejudiced by  the subsequent enactment of another  regulations,  and  much  less under the circumstances  obtaining in  the  case at  bar  wherein, I repeat lest it be forgotten, the Government purchased the Tuason  Estate No.  2 for resale  to the occupants thereof. <br><br>Furthermore, it appears that the subdivision regulations issued thereafter do not contain any provision nullifying or subjecting  thereunder those  plans that  have already been previously approved; on  the  contrary  paragraph <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, Section  8  of Executive Order No.  98,  goes as  far as authorizing the issuance of building permits on lots within the land area subject to such subdivision regulations when the lot affected "(2) <span style="font-style: italic;">corresponds in  its location  and lines with a street shown on a subdivision  plan approved by the said  administrative agency</span>".  I, therefore, conclude that the set of rules issued after the plan in question  had been approved  and  presumably after complying  with the requirements of  the  law then, obtaining, cannot be given any interpretation  and  effect that may prejudice herein petitioner. <br><br>The majority opinion also lays much stress in the provision of Section  103 of the Revised  Ordinances of the City  of Manila, which reads: <br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 103. <span style="font-style: italic;">Issuance.</span>—When the application, plans, and specifications conform to the requirements of this title and of title thirteen hereof, the city engineer shall issue a permit for the erection of the building  and shall approve in writing such plans and specifications, one  copy of which shall  be  returned to  the owner  or his agent and one copy shall be retained by the city engineer: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">That the building shall abut or face  upon a public street or alley or on a  private street or alley which  has been</span> OFFICIALLY APPROVED: <span style="font-style: italic;">And  provided, further,</span>  That any private street or alley opened in an interior lot  for the purposes of this section,  once officially approved, shall be open to the general public, and with its approved width preserved shall be maintained and kept in good repair by the grantee of the permit, his heirs, executors  and  assigns, and shall never be closed by any person so long as there is a building or other structure  abbuting or facing upon such private street or alley."</blockquote><br><br>It  may  be thus seen that  under  the  aforementioned provision of the Revised  Ordinances, a  license may  be issued as long as the lot on which the building is  sought to  be erected  <span style="font-style: italic;">abuts or faces</span> a public street or alley  or <span style="font-style: italic;">on  a private street or alley which has been officially approved</span>.  The subdivision  plan containing  the  lay-out  of the streets and lots found in the area of the Tuason Estate No. 2 has been  approved by the  Presidential Adviser  on Planning and  as  the  Executive  Order does not  specify who  has to approve  the same, it necessarily follows,  in view of the  presumption  that  official  duty   has  been regularly performed  (Section 69-n, Rule  123 of the Rules of  Court), that the  lot on which the proposed building is to be constructed is a lot that abuts or faces <span style="font-style: italic;">on a private street or alley which has been officially approved</span>.  The majority of the Court, however, quotes with approval the contention of the City Mayor that said Section  103 of the Revised Ordinances can <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> apply to streets  and alleys duly constructed,  and not to  an  area set aside for this purpose, and  to strengthen its  argument, the majority of  the Court calls attention to the last proviso requiring that any  such private alley  should be  "<span style="font-style: italic;">maintained</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">kept in  good repair by the grantee</span>", a requirement that would have no reason to exist if the alley  were  merely an  open  transitable area, without paving, drains or gutters, for the obvious purpose of the requirement was to insure the safety and health of the residents within the area. <br><br>I have already  stated that by  the  construction  of the house for which the building  permit  is  sought,  will not endanger  in  any way the safety and  health  of the residents within  said area. And  in turn  I  have also to call the  attention of the majority that the second proviso of  said  section  103  mentioned by it,  has nothing to  do with the first proviso thereof,  because the second proviso refers only to cases of "private street  or  alley (<span style="font-style: italic;">already</span>) opened in an interior  lot", and, naturally, in that  event the owner of these private alleys or grantee should maintain  and keep  them  in  good repair.  Evidently   such requirement has nothing to  do with  respect  to public  or private streets or alleys which had been  <span style="font-style: italic;">officially approved</span>. What is more, the fact that  the second proviso had  to be specifically incorporated in said Section 103, making special reference  to  streets or alleys  <span style="font-style: italic;">opened</span> in an  interior lot, inevitably would lead anyone to the conclusion that  what was intended thereby  was to  distinguish  its  scope  from the requirement of  the first proviso which merely refers to streets or  alleys which have been <span style="font-style: italic;">officially  approved</span>. <br><br>On the strength of the foregoing considerations, I  most emphatically dissent from the decision of the majority and I am of the  firm belief  and conviction that  the  decision appealed  from should be affirmed in  toto. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
