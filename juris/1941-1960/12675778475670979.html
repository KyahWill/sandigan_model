				G.R. No. L-1995, October 07, 1948</h4>
				<H3>PIO L. PESTAÃ‘O, PETITIONER, VS. P. G. CORNISTA, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF SANTA CRUZ, LAGUNA, AND THE CHIEF OF POLICE, PASIG , RIZAL, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this <i>habeas corpus</i> case, the petitioner is alleged to have been placed 
under confinement by the chief of police of Pasig, Rizal, in virtue of a warrant 
of arrest issued by the respondnet justice of the peace of Santa Cruz, Laguna, 
as a result of petitioner's failure to appear at the preliminary investigation 
in connection with a complaint for theft of coconuts against the petitioner. The 
latter contends that his presence' in the preliminary investigation was a 
personal right and, therefore, waivable by him, and such waiver, could not 
legally give rise to his arrest and detention.
<p>In his answer the respondent justice of the simply averred that the 
petitioner had already been released upon the former's directive. This averment 
has not been denied by the petitioner.</p>
<p>Without passing upon the supposed illegality of the warrant of arrest issued 
by the respondent justice of the peace, we have to rule that the petition is now 
academic.</p>
<p>Petitioner's other allegations that have reference to the sufficiency of the 
facts stated in the criminal complaint against him, to the right of the 
respondent justice of the peace to proceed with the criminal proceeding, or to 
the cancellation of petitioner's bond, are obviously not proper subjects of 
inquiry herein. Moreover, the petitioner failed to substantiate his attempt to 
hold the respondent chief of police of Pasig guilty of contempt of this 
Court.</p>
<p>The petition is denied, without costs. So ordered.</p><em>Moran, C. J., 
Ozaeta, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones, Tuason</em>, and <em>Montemayor, 
JJ.</em>, concur.<br><i>Feria, J.</i>, took no part.<p></p></div>
