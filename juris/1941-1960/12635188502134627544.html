				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Statement of the case</span>.—In  January 1951  and   years before, Mrs. Aurora S.  Negado worked in the Bureau of Posts.  Charged  with  connivance  with persons  illegally trafficking in  money  orders  in  the  post-office  premises, she  was administratively investigated.  The  Civil Service, finding  the  evidence  inconclusive,   nevertheless  recommended her transfer.   She appealed  to the  Civil Service Board of Appeals, which in due course decreed exoneration. The Director of Posts took the matter to Malacañan.  The Executive Secretary  for the President reversed, and ordered her separation from the service. <br><br>Thereafter,  she instituted this proceeding in the Manila court  of  first  instance to secure her reinstatement.   It is a petition for certiorari, alleging lack of jurisdiction or abuse of discretion on the part of the Executive Secretary. It is also <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> against the present holder of her former post,  Hermogenes E.  Cera. <br><br>After hearing  the parties,  said court dismissed  her complaint.  Hence this appeal, involving only questions of Iaw.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Facts.</span>—On or  about  January 22,  1951,  some  special policemen of the Bureau of Posts, then under instructions apprehend persons illegally trafficking in dollars  and U. S.  treasury  warrants within  the premises  of said Bureau, saw Virginia Sebastian and  Aniceta Robledo in act of buying and selling U. S. money  orders.  They miediately  approached the  two  women and requested em to go to the office of the Bureau of Posts Inspector tor investigation.  While they were on their way to the investigation  room,  Virginia  Sebastian surreptitiously passed a U.  S. money order to herein petitioner Aurora Sebastian-Negado, then Chief of a Section of the Bureau  of Posts.  The latter hastened to return to her office, but she was overtaken by one of the policeman and was there-upon requested to join them for investigation. Caught in possession of a U. S. money order, petitioner was administratively charged with:  (1) having connived with the dollar  black-marketers  plying their illegal  trade within the premises of the Post Office; and/or (2) having illegally attempted  to frustrate  the  detection  of  said  illicit transaction<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> through her assistance in the concealment of the evidence. <br><br>After  investigating the charges, the Commissioner of Civil Service, for lack of positive evidence  could not find Mrs.  Negado guilty of the offenses charged; nevertheless, he found her conduct to be  not above board, and  consequently recommended her transfer to  another  branch of the  service  with  a  reduction  of  salary.  Not satisfied with  such   administrative  determination,  Mrs.  Negado appealed  to the  Civil  Service Board  of  Appeals which exonerated her.   Convinced that the decision of the Board of Civil Service  Appeals was erroneous, the  Director of Posts, with  the  concurrence of  the Secretary  of Public Works  and  Communications  elevated  the  records of said administrative case  to  the  President of the Philippines. <br><br>After a careful review, respondent Executive Secretary, acting by direction and  authority of the President, reversed the decision of  the Civil  Service Board of Appeals  and held that although the  evidence was not conclusive of her guilty connivance, her  conduct in the premises was not above suspicion; and as her continued stay in the service would not be for the public  interest,  she was considered resigned  from her position, effective the date of her  suspension incident  to another pending administrative charge for misconduct in office. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lack of jurisdiction</span>.—In her first assignment of error, appellant  questions  the President's authority and jurisdiction to act upon the appeal of the Director of Posts, because (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)  said Director had no  right  to  appeal from the determination of the Civil Service Board of Appeals, and  (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)  supposing he  could appeal, such appeal had been made outside the  thirty-day period  fixed by  law.  She quotes  the pertinent  provisions of  Commonwealth  Act No. 598. <br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. . . .He may, for neglect  of duty or violation of reasonable office regulation  or in the interest  of  public  service, remove any subordinate officer or employee from the service, suspend him without  pay for not  more than two months, reduce his salary or compensation,  or deduct therefrom any sum  not exceeding: one month's  pay. From  the  decision of the  Commissioner of Civil Service on  administrative investigation  an appeal  may  be  taken by the officer or  employee concerned to the Civil  Service Board of Appeals within thirty days after receipt  by him of the decision." <br><br>"SEC.  2. . . .The  Civil Service  Board  of Appeals shall have the power and  authority to  hear  and decide  all  administrative cases brought before it on appeal, and  its decision in such cases shall be final, unless a reversed or modified  by the President of the Philippines . . ."</blockquote>Explaining her first  proposition,  she points out  that under section 1, it is only "the officer or employee  concerned"  who may appeal.   In the  first place, the section refers to appeals to the Board of Appeals—not  appeals to  the  President. In the  second  place,  "officer  or  employee concerned" does not exclusively mean the employee under investigation.   The Director or Chief of the  Bureau may  also  be the officer concerned.  And such  has been the  administrative practice. Let it  not be  argued  that the appeal  by  the  Director places   the  employee  in  a second  jeopardy.  The  administrative proceeding is not a criminal case. <br><br>As to the  thirty-day period, it does not apply to  appeals to President, which section 2 permits,  without any limitation as to time or persons.  In fact, even without appeals, the  President could  <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> review" or revise the decision  of the Civil Service Board of Appeals by virtue of his constitutional control of the Executive Departments. Furthermore,  as  Department Head of the said Appeals Board (section  74 Administrative Code) the  President has statutory authority to reverse its adjudication.   (Section 79  [<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>] Administrative Code.) <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abuse  of  discretion</span>.—Given  the President's  power to review,  still  the  appellant  imputes grave abuse  of  discretion to the decision "calling for  her separation  despite his express  findings  that she cannot  be  found guilty of the two charges against her."  "And even granting, without admitting, that she was found guilty of these charges," the petitioner  submits that her  conduct was  "not  a sufficient and legal  ground  for removal  from the service, as it is not  the  cause contemplated by the law and  the Constitution  for the  reason that the  alleged misconduct is only her  <span style="font-style: italic;">personal</span> misbehavior, not  her<span style="font-style: italic;"> official</span> misconduct,  such misconduct not being directly related to or connected  with her official duties." <br><br>The  pertinent portion  of the President's decision reads as  follows: <br><blockquote>"However, respondent's  conduct is,  to  say the least,  not  above suspicion.  When Miss Sebastian gave  her the money order wrapped in Kleenex paper with the  verbal advice  "do not open this  until you reach your table," the respondent must  have sensed something wrong,  considering  that  these  words  were uttered  by  a person who was virtually  under arrest or in the custody of an  officer of the law.  Prudence should have impelled her not to accept  what was being handed  to  her under such circumstance.  Her subsequent conduct cannot but engender  serious doubts as to her good faith, it appearing  that  after  finding out  that the thing given to her was a  dollar money  order, she made no  attempt to return it immediately  to Miss  Sebastian with a view  to precluding  any possible  suspicion of her  being  involved in  any  dollar  trafficking. <br><br>It appearing that the respondent was  involved in another administrative case  in which she  was charged with various irregularities;  that  by reason  of said  case she was suspended  from duty effected January 18, 1954; that  in the decision  of the Commissioner of Civil  Service dated April  17, 1954, she was  found guilty of violation of regulations for having engaged in the business of  selling  fancy  jewelry without permission,  sometimes  utilizing the office premises  for that purpose,  and was  considered resigned effective the date of her suspension, without  prejudice  to  reinstatement except in the  Bureau of  Posts;  and that  the case  is now on appeal in the Civil  Service Board of Appeals. <br><br>In  view of the foregoing,  it is believed that respondent's further employment in the  Bureau  of  Posts will  not be in  the  public interest.  The decision appealed from  is therefore modified in the sense that the respondent is considered resigned effective January 18, 1954, the date   of her  suspension,  without  prejudice to  reinstatement except in the  Bureau of Posts." </blockquote>The  findings  are  definite and explicit.  Although  the evidence was not "conclusive" Mrs. Negado's conduct was "to  say  the least, not  above suspicion."  That was  a tactful way of saying "but I  am morally convinced  she was  not innocent."  So the  Executive Secretary held,  her further  employment  in  the Bureau  of  Posts "will  not be in the public interest."  Under Commonwealth Act No. 598<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> any subordinate officer or employee may be removed from office "in the interest of public service or for violation of  reasonable office regulations."   In the  circumstances,  there  was we  believe, no  abuse  of  discretion, much less grave abuse thereof.  There is  no valid ground to contend that her conduct had  no connection with her duties.  The  Bureau of  Posts where she was employed, dealth officially  with money orders. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Administrative discipline</span>—The  question  whether  the facts disclosed in the investigation required the separation of the employee in  the interest of public service is largely one to be determined by the corresponding administrative authorities.   Not for the judiciary to reexamine the record and test  the  official verdict in the light of organizational needs and/or command  responsibility—unless  of course, there was no  due process, or the objectionable conduct was so clearly unrelated to the employee's  duties, that the adjudication evinced a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment overstepping the limits  of official  jurisdiction.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup> <br><br>It  is not true that  Mrs.  Negado  was  punished  for mere suspicion.  In her hands was found  a  "contraband" article: a money order being illegally negotiated.  Violating her duty  as a  government employee  to  help prevent such illegal negotiations,  she practically  helped the concealment  or attempted concealment from the officers of the "contraband" goods.   This, added to her other transgressions  (violation of  regulations,  by   selling jewelry without permission, sometimes utilizing the office premises for that purpose)  constituted in our  opinion  more than sufficient ground for her dismissal.  Instead of being thus removed,  she  was just considered resigned,  a lesser disciplinary  measure. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Substitution of parties</span>.—The first three respondent officers have ceased to hold their respective  positions.  Yet the  plaintiff  failed to make substitution of  parties  in accordance with  section  18,  Rule  3.  In  view  however, of the resultant opinion,  we  have deemed it unnecessary to require compliance with the said procedural  step. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Judgment</span>.—Wherefore,  the order  quashing this action should be, and it is hereby,  affirmed  with  costs  against appellant <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Montemayor,  Reyes,  A.,  Bautista  Angelo, Concepcion,  Reyes,  J. B.
