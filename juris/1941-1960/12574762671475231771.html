				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal on points of law from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
Nueva Ecija (Civil Case No. 2006) dismissing condemnation proceedings instituted 
by the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA).</p>
<p>It appears from the record that on June 11, 1955, Republic Act No. 1266 
became operative. This law provided as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 1. The National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration 
(NARRA) is hereby authorized to expropriate within six months from the approval 
of this Act, the Hacienda del Rosario situated at Valdefuente, Cabanatuan City, 
and pay the price of the land and cost of such expropriation out of its funds. 
The said hacienda, shall be subdivided into lots not bigger than one hectare 
each and resold to bona-fide occupants thereof at such price as may be 
determined by the Board of Directors of the NARRA which shall include the price 
of the land and the cost of such expropriation, administration, subdivision, 
resale and interests. The purchase price of the resale to bona-fide tenants and 
lessees shall be payable in installments within the period of not more than ten 
years. Sec. 2. This Act shall take effect upon its approval."</p></blockquote>
<p>In accordance with the statute, the NARRA instituted these eminent domain 
proceedings in the Court below against the heirs of the original owner of the 
Hacienda (the late Judge Simplicio del Rosario, who died in 1947) and their 
subsequent vendees. The lands involved totalled 669 hectares, more or less; but 
during the pendency of the proceedings, the heirs Dolores R. de Concepcion, 
Teresa R. de Francisco and Paz R. de Tubangui agreed to the expropriation of 
their respective holding; while defendant spouses Carmen R. de Ciocon and Jaime 
Cioqon also agreed to the expropriation of their corresponding share, except a 
portion of 85.0414 hectares, which said spouses were occupying and wished to 
reserve for their seven (7) children and sixteen (16) grandchildren. As a 
result, all the defendants mentioned voluntarily ceded to the NARRA about 
391.7583 hectares.</p>
<p>The case then continued against the remaining defendants who (except the 
Ciocons) were purchasers and sub-acquirers of various portions of the original 
hacienda, and held different areas ranging from one-half to thirteen (13) 
hectares, all acquired between 1949 and 1954; before the passage of Republic Act 
No. 1266.</p>
<p>Invoking the decisions of this Court in Republic <em>vs</em>. Baylosis, 96 
Phil., 461; 51 Off. Gaz., 722 and Rural Progress Administration <em>vs</em>. 
Guido, 84 Phil., 847, the Court a quo declared that the condemnation proceedings 
did not lie against the remaining defendants, and held that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Long before Republic Act No. 1266 was approved on June 11, 1955, the lots of 
the defendants were already segregated from and were no longer identified with, 
the Hacienda del Rosario. As a matter of fact, since April 7, 1938, or on 
October 11, 1951, Hacienda del Rosario ceased to Â¦exist. If it exists at all, it 
does so in name only; for the estate which was formerly known by said name was 
already broken up and partitioned among the five vendees and heirs of the 
original owner, the late Judge Simplicio del Rosario. Hence, Republic Act 1266 
cannot apply to the lots of the remaining defendants as it authorizes 
condemnation proceedings only against the Hacienda del Rosario.</p>
<p>Moreover, by reason of their small areas, the said lots cannot be the subject 
of expropriation for purposes of resale, because each lot is not the big landed 
estate contemplated in Section 4 of Article XIII, Constitution, as construed by 
the Supreme Court in numerous cases. The case of Republic of the Philippines 
<em>vs</em>. Baylosis, (96 Phil., 461; 51 Off. Gaz., 722) is decisive of the 
case at bar. Not even the decision in the case of Rural Progress Administration 
<em>vs</em>. Reyes (G.R. No. L-4703, Oct. 8, 1953), which the Baylosis case 
supersedes, can be applied to the present case by analogy.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * </p>
<p>"It shall be noted that the 300 or so families who are to be favored by the 
expropriation can easily be accommodated in the expropriation area of about 391 
plus hectares.</p>
<p>"The foregoing reasoning operates likewise against the right of the plaintiff 
to expropriate the 85 hectares now presently owned and occupied by the 
defendants-spouses Carmen R. Ciocon and Jaime Ciocon. Considering that the 
Ciocon family had already agreed to the expropriation of about 108 hectares of 
their property; that the said family is composed of seven children and 16 
grand-children; that the Ciocon family are actually occupying and cultivating 
the said 85 hectares through mechanized methods and not through tenants, much 
less through any of the alleged 300 or so occupants of the other lots; the said 
85 hectares could not be considered as a big landed estate within the purview of 
Section 4 of Article XIII of the Constitution."</p></blockquote>
<p>The NARRA appealed from the decision, contending that the authorities cited 
by the Court below were not applicable because they involved condemnation 
proceedings under Commonwealth Act No. 539; that in view of the terms of 
Republic Act 1266, "the Court can not inquire into nor review the action of the 
Legislature in designating the particular property it has authorized the NARRA 
to expropriate."</p>
<p>We see no merit in the appeal. The power to expropriate, under both Republic 
Act 1266 and Commonwealth Act No. 539, is predicated upon the provisions of 
Article XIII, Sec. 4 of the Constitution, providing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 4. The Congress may authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the 
expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to 
individuals";</p></blockquote>
<p>hence, the rulings of this Court as to the limits of the condemning power 
rendered in expropriation proceedings instituted pursuant to Commonwealth Act 
No. 539 are applicable to the case at bar.</p>
<p>This Court, in the Guido and Bayiosis cases, has already-ruled that, under 
the quoted constitutional provision, the government may only expropriate landed 
estates with extensive areas, and that once a landed estate has been broken up 
and divided into parcels of reasonable extent, the resulting portions are no 
longer subject to further expropriation, the existence of tenancy troubles 
therein notwithstanding.</p>
<p>The doctrine, while not unanimous, still stands unre-versed; hence, it must 
be applied to the present case, since the subdivision of the original Hacienda 
del Rosario, and the reasonable size of the portions now involved in this 
appeal, is uncontested. There is the more reason for adhering to the rulings 
above-mentioned, now that the NARRA has already acquired almost two-thirds of 
the original hacienda, and the court below found as a fact that the tenants' 
families intended to be favored by the expropriation can be easily accommodated 
in the area already acquired.</p>
<p>The appellant relies on City of Manila vs. Chinese Community, 40 Phil., 350, 
wherein it was stated that where the legislature has directly determined the 
necessity of appropriating private property for a particular public improvement 
at a specified location, the utility, necessity and expediency of the 
improvement and the suitableness of the location are questions for the 
legislature to determine and the courts have no power to interfere and 
substitute their own discretion. The doctrine thus invoked is entirely 
inappropriate, for the question now before the Court is not the necessity of the 
expropriation but the power or authority to expropriate under Article XIII, Sec. 
4, of the Constitution. The validity of the statute directing the expropriation 
is certainly a judicial question.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, 
Gutierrez David,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
