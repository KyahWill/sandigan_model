				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In Special&nbsp; Proceedings No.&nbsp; 684 of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija for&nbsp; the settlement of the intestate estate of the deceased Isidro&nbsp; P. Aurelio,&nbsp; the First National Surety&nbsp; &amp; Assurance Co., on&nbsp; October 12, 1955, presented a claim against the estate for the total amount of P14,030.10, allegedly duo claimant under its Bond No.&nbsp; LES-080, which it had&nbsp; issued as surety for&nbsp; the deceased&nbsp; in favor of the Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; The deceased had&nbsp; signed, with two other persons, an indemnity contract agreeing to Pay, jointly and severally, to the surety company any losses, damages, payments, costs and expenses of whatever kind and nature,&nbsp; including attorney's&nbsp; fees and premiums for renewals or extensions.&nbsp; The claimed amount of P4,030.10 purportedly represents the following items:<br><blockquote>(1) P11,717.48&nbsp; as the amount being demanded from claimant by Philippine National Bank, through the&nbsp; Bureau of Commerce&nbsp; under said&nbsp; Bond No. LES-080; <br>(2) P555.00 as premiums&nbsp; on said bond for three years; and <br>(3) P1,757.62&nbsp; as&nbsp; attorney's fees.</blockquote>On October&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1955, the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; issued&nbsp; an order approving the surety company's&nbsp;&nbsp; claim&nbsp; "in the&nbsp; sum of P11,717.48" and ordered&nbsp; the Administrator&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the same out of the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; of the deceased within&nbsp; sixty days. The Administrator&nbsp; sought&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; of the order on the ground that the claim in question&nbsp; was contingent on claimant's&nbsp; paying the principal&nbsp; obligation;&nbsp; that&nbsp; such payment had not yet been made; and that the estate had already paid a portion of the obligation to the Philippine National Bank and was taking steps to&nbsp; settle the balance of the&nbsp; liability.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court,&nbsp; however, found that&nbsp; the obligation of the deceased to the claimant surety company was&nbsp; based on&nbsp; their&nbsp; indemnity agreement&nbsp; under the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; which the deceased agreed to pay&nbsp; the surety company "as soon as demand is received from the creditor"; hence,&nbsp; it denied&nbsp; the motion for reconsideration,&nbsp; and&nbsp; held that&nbsp; "the claim of the First National Surety &amp; Assurance Co.,&nbsp; Inc. is in order&nbsp; and should&nbsp; be&nbsp; paid by&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of the deceased"&nbsp; (Order of November 25, 1955).&nbsp; No appeal having&nbsp; been taken&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; orders approving&nbsp; the claim, the same&nbsp; became final and executory.<br><br>On June 22, 1956,&nbsp; the&nbsp; claimant surety company filed a petition with the trial court, alleging' that the Administrator had already&nbsp; paid&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P11,718.00 on account of its claim,&nbsp; and praying that he b3 ordered to pay&nbsp; the remaining&nbsp; balance of P3,322.18&nbsp; with&nbsp; interest until&nbsp; full payment.&nbsp; The administrator opposed this petition aver- ring&nbsp; that the claim of the surety company was approved in the amount of&nbsp; P11,717.48, and the estate having&nbsp; paid said&nbsp; amount, payment of further sums&nbsp; should be&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; Whereupon, the&nbsp; court,&nbsp; on July 6, 1956, issued an order stating&nbsp; that the&nbsp; surety company's claim&nbsp; against the estate was&nbsp; the amount of P14,030.10 and it&nbsp; was&nbsp; only&nbsp; through clerical error that the court, in&nbsp; its&nbsp; order&nbsp; of October 26, 1955, limited its amount to P11,717.48; and amended said order "in the sense that the amount&nbsp; to be paid&nbsp; by the said Administrator is P14,030.10&nbsp; and considering the&nbsp; interest which the&nbsp; money&nbsp; should&nbsp; earn, there is&nbsp; a&nbsp; balance in&nbsp; the amount of P3,322.18 which should be paid to the petitioner by the said Administrator", and ordered the Administrator&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; P3,322.18&nbsp; in addition to that already&nbsp; paid, with interest&nbsp; at the rate of P4.35 daily&nbsp; from&nbsp; June 22, 1956, until the same is fully paid".&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrator filed a motion for&nbsp; reconsideration, stressing that the&nbsp; order of October 26, 1955 having become final&nbsp; and unappealable, and having already been executed by his payment to the claimant company of the amount of P11,718.00, the court no longer&nbsp; had&nbsp; jurisdiction to amend&nbsp; said order.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the motion for reconsideration was denied; hence, the Administrator filed&nbsp; the&nbsp; present petition for&nbsp; certiorari with&nbsp; this Court.<br><br>Assuming that the&nbsp; claim of the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; company should&nbsp; have been approved&nbsp; for more&nbsp; than the amount of P11,718.00,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; committed&nbsp; an error in&nbsp; approving said claim for only the sum&nbsp; of P11,717.48, the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; approval&nbsp; has,&nbsp; however&nbsp; become&nbsp; final&nbsp; and unappealable, and beyond the power of the court below to amend or modify.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court sought to justify the amendment (increasing the amount awarded) on the theory that it committed a simple&nbsp; clerical&nbsp; error when it approved the claim&nbsp; for P11,717.48.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; such&nbsp; amendment&nbsp; can not be said to merely correct&nbsp; a clerical mistake; for&nbsp; the original order approved the claim in question&nbsp; for P11,717.48 only, and to&nbsp; increase the same by 3,322.18, plus interests, is to effect&nbsp; a substantial&nbsp; and material change in the original order, under which the estate had already acquired&nbsp; the right to pay the claimant P11.717.48&nbsp; and no&nbsp; more.&nbsp; Distinguishing the court's power to correct errors and omissions in final judgments from its power to repair&nbsp; a judicial error or inaction therein, Freeman makes&nbsp; the&nbsp; following comment:<br><blockquote>"The general power&nbsp; to correct clerical errors and omissions&nbsp; does not authorize&nbsp; the court to repair&nbsp; its&nbsp; own inaction, to&nbsp; make the record&nbsp; and&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; say&nbsp; what&nbsp; the court&nbsp; did&nbsp; not adjudge, although it had a&nbsp; clear right to do so. The&nbsp; court can&nbsp; not under the guise&nbsp; of correcting&nbsp; its record&nbsp; put&nbsp;&nbsp; upon&nbsp; it&nbsp; an&nbsp; order or judgment it never&nbsp; made or rendered, or add&nbsp; something to either which was not originally&nbsp; included&nbsp; although it might and should have so ordered&nbsp; or adjudged in the&nbsp; first instance.&nbsp; It can&nbsp; not thus repair its own&nbsp; lapses&nbsp; and omissions to&nbsp; do what it could legally&nbsp; and&nbsp; properly&nbsp; have done&nbsp; at the&nbsp;&nbsp; right&nbsp; time.&nbsp;&nbsp; A court's mistake in leaving" out of its decision something which it ought to have put in,&nbsp; and something in issue of which it intended but failed to dispose, is a judicial&nbsp; error, not a&nbsp; mere clerical misprision,&nbsp; and can not&nbsp; be corrected&nbsp; by&nbsp; adding to the&nbsp; entered judgment the omitted&nbsp; matter on&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory of making the entry conform to the actual judgment entered."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Freeman on Judgments, see. 141, Vol.&nbsp; I, p.&nbsp; 273)</blockquote>Pursuant to the above rule, we held&nbsp; in Marasigan vs. Ronquillo, 94&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 237,&nbsp; that&nbsp; "the&nbsp; rule&nbsp; is absolute&nbsp; that after a judgment becomes final,&nbsp; by the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of the period&nbsp; provided by the rules within&nbsp; which it so becomes, no further amendment or correction can be&nbsp; made&nbsp; by the court&nbsp; except&nbsp; for clerical errors or mistakes".&nbsp; And&nbsp; in Halili vs. Public Service Commission, 98 Phil., 357, we said that the mere fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; decision does not conform to the evidence presented is not a justification for an&nbsp; amendment of the decision;&nbsp; and that rights acquired by virtue of a decision should not be revoked under the pretext of amendment.<br><br>The respondent&nbsp; company&nbsp; points&nbsp; to the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court's order of November 25, 1955&nbsp; (denying petitioner's&nbsp; motion to reconsider its earlier order of October 26,&nbsp; 1955 approving the claim of P11,717.48), the&nbsp; dispositive portion&nbsp; of which&nbsp; says that "the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of the&nbsp; First National&nbsp; Surety &amp; Assurance Co., Inc. is in&nbsp; order and should be paid&nbsp; by the estate of the deceased"; and&nbsp; argues that as the&nbsp; correct amount of its claim is P14,030, with interests, that is the amount that the estate must pay under this&nbsp; second order. The argument is untenable, for in said order of November 25, 1955,&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp;&nbsp; simply rejected petitioner's theory that he could&nbsp; be made to answer for the surety company's claim only after the latter had paid the creditor and not before, on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that the estate's liability is based on an express provision in the&nbsp; indemnity agreement between claimant and the&nbsp; deceased that indemnity will&nbsp; be made "as&nbsp; soon as&nbsp; demand&nbsp; is received from the creditor * *&nbsp; *".&nbsp; The order in&nbsp; question&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; state that the surety&nbsp; company's claim, approved&nbsp; at P11,717.48 in the court's first order of&nbsp; October 26, 1955, had been increased to a bigger&nbsp; amount on the other hand,&nbsp; it still referred to the claim&nbsp; of the&nbsp; company as "in the amount of P11,717.48".<br><br>If respondent had wanted the order of October 26, 1955 amended so as to correct the amount of its approved claim, it should&nbsp; have promptly called the attention of the court to that matter and asked for the correction of the amount allowed.&nbsp; Only respondent, however., failed to take this step; the order approving its claim for a lesser amount became final and&nbsp; executory (it has&nbsp; in fact been fully executed by payment of the Administrator of the amount of P11,718.00) ; and thereafter, it was too late, and beyond the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court,&nbsp; to&nbsp; repair its&nbsp; error by&nbsp; substantially amending&nbsp; an already final and executed&nbsp; judgment (Carla Pirovano, et&nbsp; al. vs. Canizares, G. R. L-9431, May 17, 1957).<br><br>The Order appealed from is therefore', set&nbsp; aside.&nbsp; Costs against respondent First National Surety &amp; Assurance Co.
