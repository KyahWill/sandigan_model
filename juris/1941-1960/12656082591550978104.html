				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 24, 1954, a complaint for kidnapping was filed with the Justice of the Peace Court of Naic, Cavite, against several&nbsp;&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; including&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; herein&nbsp;&nbsp; Mariano Villanueva.&nbsp;&nbsp; After conducting the first phase of&nbsp; the preliminary&nbsp; investigation provided in the&nbsp; Rules of Court, the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; of&nbsp; Naic&nbsp; issued&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding warrants of arrests, which were duly served.&nbsp; When the defendants&nbsp; appeared&nbsp; before&nbsp; said court on August&nbsp; 20, 1954, for the second&nbsp; stage&nbsp; of the preliminary investigation, they&nbsp; waived their&nbsp; right&nbsp; thereto,&nbsp; whereupon,&nbsp; the record of the case was forwarded to&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of Cavite.&nbsp; Later on, after making a preliminary investigation,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; course of which&nbsp; several witnesses&nbsp; gave testimony, under oath, implicating Villanueva's wife,&nbsp; Consuelo&nbsp; Papa-Villanueya, in the commission of the crime&nbsp; charged in said complaint, the provincial fiscal of Cavite&nbsp; filed the information, Annex D, charging, with kidnapping,&nbsp; not only&nbsp; the original defendants, but, also, said Consuelo Papa-Villanueva and one Tomas Panganiban.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the foot&nbsp; of said information the following appears:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"I hereby certify that I have conducted the preliminary investigation of the above-entitled case with respect to accused Tomas Panganiban and&nbsp; Consuelo Papa-Villanueva, having examined the witnesses&nbsp; under oath and that&nbsp; there is reasonable&nbsp; ground to believe&nbsp; that the&nbsp; accused committed the crime charged, and&nbsp; further certify&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; other accused have waived their rights to preliminary investigation&nbsp; conducted before&nbsp; the Justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; of&nbsp; Naic, Cavite,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><table style="width: 539px; height: 52px;" align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="60%"></td><td width="40%"><div align="center">MARIANO V. BENEDICTO</div></td></tr><tr><td><br></td><td><div align="center"><em>Provincial Fiscal</em></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>"Subscribed and sworn to Defore me this 13th day; of; September, 1954, at Cavite City. </blockquote><p align="right">Deputy&nbsp; Clerk&nbsp; of Court" </p><p>On October 20, 1954, Villanueva filed, with the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cavite, a petition&nbsp; praying&nbsp; "that a&nbsp; reinvestigation of this case be&nbsp; ordered so that herein&nbsp; accused may be afforded of their own right as provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; in * * *&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 732."&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; was followed&nbsp; on October 29,&nbsp; 1954 by a motion to quash,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that the&nbsp; information is&nbsp; null and&nbsp; void&nbsp; for alleged noncompliance with said Republic Act No.&nbsp; 732. This motion, as well as said petition for reinvestigation, were denied in an&nbsp; order dated January 10, 1955.&nbsp; A&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; thereof was sought in a motion&nbsp; filed by the&nbsp; Villanuevas&nbsp; on&nbsp; February 10, 1955.&nbsp; Four (4) days later the court issued an order the&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; part&nbsp; of which reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"However, in the interest of the administration of&nbsp; Justice, it is| hereby ordered that a preliminary investigation be held before&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court with respect to the said accused-spouses wherein the prosecution should present whatever evidence it has against them. This&nbsp; preliminary investigation is hereby set for February 19, 1955, at 8:30 a.m."</p></blockquote><p>This order was, on motion for reconsideration&nbsp; filed by the prosecution amended by another dated February&nbsp; 15, 1955,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; following&nbsp; tenor:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Considering the petition for&nbsp; reconsideration of the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal&nbsp; and finding the&nbsp; same to be well founded,&nbsp; the&nbsp; order dated February 14,&nbsp; 1955 is hereby reconsidered in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sense&nbsp; that&nbsp; the preliminary investigation granted to&nbsp; the accused-spouses Mariano Villanueva and&nbsp; Consuelo Papa shall&nbsp; take&nbsp; place at the&nbsp; time with, the trial as against the other accused, and this on March d, 2,&nbsp; 3 and 4, 1955, at two o'clock&nbsp; in the afternoon, instead of on&nbsp; February 19, 1955,&nbsp; as previously scheduled.&nbsp; </p><p>"The said accused-spouses and their counsel are hereby advised to be thorough&nbsp; in&nbsp; their cross-examination&nbsp; of the&nbsp; prosecution witnesses so that in the event&nbsp; that the Court finds the evidence of the prosecution&nbsp; to&nbsp; be sufficient in establishing a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima&nbsp; fade </span>case as against them, such evidence&nbsp; adduced at the preliminary&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; with&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; said&nbsp; accused-spouses may very well be reproduced without the&nbsp; necessity of presenting all over again such testimonies&nbsp; of&nbsp; witnesses who&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; already given evidence in Court."</p></blockquote><p>What transpired on March 1,&nbsp; 1955, when the case was called&nbsp; for a&nbsp; second preliminary investigation&nbsp; and&nbsp; trial, at the same&nbsp; time, is&nbsp; set forth in&nbsp; the order of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Cavite of March 15, 1955, from&nbsp; which we quote:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * * when the Court posed to query to the said accused-spouses in the afternoon of March&nbsp; 1st,&nbsp; 1955, as to&nbsp; whether or not they are willing to have the testimonies&nbsp; of the witnesses to be presented by the prosecution at such second preliminary&nbsp; investigation reproduced at the trial of the case&nbsp; with respect to them in the eventuality that the Court, after such second preliminary investigation, finds <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span>&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; against&nbsp; them, the&nbsp; said accused-spouses&nbsp; declined to make their stand known, and even refused to be arraigned on the information as against them unless the second preliminary investigation&nbsp; be&nbsp; first conducted by&nbsp; the Court,&nbsp; which arraignment was requested by the Fiscal by way of forestalling any future objection on the&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the said accused spouses to the reproduction later on at&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; of the&nbsp; testimonies&nbsp; to&nbsp; be given by the&nbsp; prosecution witnesses in the preliminary investigation sought by the accused spouses.&nbsp; </p><p>"This&nbsp; attitude on&nbsp; the part of&nbsp; accused-spouses,&nbsp; Villanueva and Papa,&nbsp; gives&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; the&nbsp; impression that they&nbsp; are obstructing the objective of the Court towards a&nbsp; speedy trial, considering that this Court issued&nbsp; its aforequoted order with a view&nbsp; to&nbsp; (1st)&nbsp; protesting innocent accused from unjustified delays in the proceedings in the meanwhile that they stand accused,&nbsp; and (2nd) to protecting society at large, by seeing to it that the guilty are convicted at the earliest possible date. In this manner, it occurred to the mind of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; that the&nbsp; paramount&nbsp; interests&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; administration of justice demand that this contemplated second preliminary investigation, as&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by the Court to the&nbsp; accused-spouses,&nbsp; should now be, as it is hereby, withdrawn&nbsp; and cancelled.&nbsp; </p><p>"Let it therefore be declared that this case be put in the calendar for the arraignment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-named&nbsp; accused-spouses, Mariano B. Villanueva and&nbsp; Consuelo&nbsp; Papa.&nbsp; </p><p>"The petition for reconsideration of the Provincial Fiscal&nbsp; dated March 1st, 1955 is accordingly granted, with the cancellation and withdrawal of the order of February 15, 1955 granting accused-spouses Villanueva&nbsp; and Papa the so-called&nbsp; second preliminary investigation.&nbsp; </p><p>"The Clerk of Court is instructed to set this case for the arraignment&nbsp; of said) accused-spouses, Villanueva&nbsp; and Papa, after which another date should be set for the trial of the case&nbsp; on the merits with regard&nbsp; to all&nbsp; the accused.</p></blockquote><p>Thereupon, the Villanuevas instituted the present action for "certiorari,&nbsp;&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; iftandamus",&nbsp; with&nbsp; the prayer&nbsp; that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"1. Pending hearing of this petition&nbsp; on the merits,&nbsp; and upon the filing of a&nbsp; bond in such amount as this Honorable Court may fix, a writ of&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; injunction be&nbsp; immediately issued&nbsp; against the respondent Judge Primitivo Gonzales restraining him from proceeding with the arraignment of the herein petitioners and the&nbsp; trial of the said criminal case No. 11,867 of the Court of First Instance of Cavite insofar as herein petitioners are&nbsp; concerned.&nbsp; </p><p>"2.&nbsp; After hearing, an order be issued annulling and setting aside the order of the respondent Judge dated&nbsp; March&nbsp; 15, 1955, Annex 'F'&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petition, and&nbsp; giving full force and effect&nbsp; to the&nbsp; orders dated&nbsp; February&nbsp; 14 and&nbsp; 15, 1955, quoted in paragraphs 17&nbsp; and 18 of the petition in which&nbsp; orders respondent Judge&nbsp; directed&nbsp; the prosecution to&nbsp; present&nbsp; its evidence at&nbsp; a&nbsp; preliminary investigation to be conducted by respondent&nbsp; Judge in&nbsp; the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; of petitioners.&nbsp; </p><p>"3. In the alternative an order be issued, after hearing, directing respondent Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; Mariano B. Benedicto&nbsp; to conduct a preliminary investigation of the case with due notice to the herein petitioners of the place, date and&nbsp; hour&nbsp; of such investigation and according to petitioners the right&nbsp; to cross-examine&nbsp; the witnesses against them.&nbsp; </p><p>"4. Respondents be ordered to answer this&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; </p><p>"5. The preliminary writ of&nbsp; injunction be&nbsp; made final and permanent,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; either the&nbsp; respondent judge&nbsp; or respondent&nbsp; fiscal conducts a preliminary investigation of which petitioners should be notified and at which&nbsp; they&nbsp; should&nbsp; be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses.&nbsp; </p><p>"6: Petitioners be&nbsp; awarded such other&nbsp; remedy and&nbsp; relief&nbsp; as may be just and&nbsp; equitable&nbsp; in the premises." The writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction prayed&nbsp; for has not been issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the language of&nbsp; petitioners herein, the question for determination is:&nbsp; </p><p>* * *'Under the provision of Republic Act No. 752, may a provincial&nbsp; fiscal file an information without first notifying&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused so as to enable the latter to be present at the preliminary investigation to be conducted by him and to cross-examine&nbsp; the&nbsp; witnesses of the complainant or the prosecution?'"</p></blockquote><p>Petitioners urge a negative answer, relying, upon section 1687 of the Revised Administrative Code, as&nbsp; amended by section&nbsp; 2 of Republic Act No. 732,&nbsp; reading:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"A provincial fiscal&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have authority to conduct investigation into the matter of&nbsp; any crime or misdemeanor and&nbsp; have the necessary information&nbsp; or complaint prepared or made&nbsp; against persons&nbsp; charged with&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of&nbsp; the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; offense charged&nbsp; falls within&nbsp; the original jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance the defendant shall not be entitled as a matter&nbsp; of right to preliminary investigation&nbsp; in any case where the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; fiscal himself after due&nbsp; investigation of the facts made in the presence of the accused if the latter so requested, 'shall have presented an information against him&nbsp; in&nbsp; proper form and certified under oath by the said provincial fiscal that he conducted a proper preliminary investigation.&nbsp; To this end,&nbsp; he may,&nbsp; with due&nbsp; notice to the&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; summon reputed&nbsp; witnesses and require them&nbsp; to appear before him and&nbsp; testify and be&nbsp; cross-examined under oath by the accused&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the tatter's request. The attendance or evidence of absent or&nbsp; recalcitrant witnesses who may be summoned or whose testimony&nbsp; may be required by&nbsp; the provincial fiscal&nbsp; under the authority herein conferred shall be enforced by proper&nbsp; process upon application to be made by the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; fiscal to any Judge of First Instance of the Judicial District. But no witness summoned to testify under&nbsp; this section&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; compelled to give testimony to&nbsp; incriminate himself.&nbsp; </p><p>"The Provincial Fiscal shall also cause to be investigated the cause of sudden deaths&nbsp; which&nbsp; have not&nbsp; been satisfactorily explained and when there is suspicion that the cause arose from the unlawful acts or omissions of other persons, or from foul&nbsp; play. For that purpose he may cause autopsies&nbsp; to be made and&nbsp; shall be entitled&nbsp; to demand and receive for purposes of such investigations or autopsies, the aid of&nbsp; the&nbsp; medico-legal section of the&nbsp; National Bureau&nbsp; of Investigation or of the District Health Officer&nbsp; and the different presidents&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sanitary divisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; province." (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Petitioners contention is untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Republic Act No. 732, governs preliminary investigations conducted by provincial fiscals&nbsp; in&nbsp; cases originally&nbsp; instituted by them in courts of first instance. It does not apply to cases begun in justice of the peace courts&nbsp; and,&nbsp; thereafter, forwarded to the corresponding court of first instance, either after the&nbsp; second phase of the preliminary investigation required in the Rules of Court had been conducted before said justice of the peace courts, or after a waiver&nbsp; by the accused of their right to said&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation. The reason is obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; In those cases the provincial fiscal is under no obligation to make such preliminary&nbsp; investigation.&nbsp; 'He may&nbsp; rely upon&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; introduced in, and the facts&nbsp; found by, the justice&nbsp; of the peace court, at the&nbsp; preliminary investigation therein&nbsp; conducted.</p><p>With respect to petitioner&nbsp; Consuelo Papa-Villanueva, who was not included in the complaint filed with the justice of the peace&nbsp; court of Naic, the legality&nbsp; of the&nbsp; preliminary investigation&nbsp; made by the&nbsp; provincial fiscal,&nbsp; as regards said petitioner, is&nbsp; not&nbsp; affected by&nbsp; the lack&nbsp; of previous notice thereof to her, for said notice is "required only after the&nbsp; accused has&nbsp; requested to&nbsp; be present&nbsp; at the investigation" Lozada <em>vs.</em> Fernandez,&nbsp; (92&nbsp; Phil., 1051), April 29,&nbsp; 1953, and no such request had&nbsp; been&nbsp; made&nbsp; by Mrs. Villanueva prior to said preliminary investigation. In Rodriguez <em>vs.</em> Arellano&nbsp; (96 Phil.,&nbsp; 954),&nbsp; decided&nbsp; on April 30, 1955, we declared:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>" * * *that it is not the duty&nbsp; of the provincial fiscal conducting&nbsp; a&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation under the authority of&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 732, to notify the accused thereof so&nbsp; that the&nbsp; latter may exercise&nbsp; his&nbsp; right&nbsp; to request his presence in&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation. We&nbsp; held, however, that if during an investigation&nbsp; and&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to the filing of the information, the accused requests to be present, the fiscal must conduct the investigation in his presence.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case at bar, we hold that the&nbsp; respondent judge exceeded&nbsp; his powers in remanding the&nbsp; case&nbsp; for a new investigation&nbsp; and requiring&nbsp; the provincial fiscal&nbsp; to comply with the demand of the respondent&nbsp; accused that he be notified&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; because the&nbsp; investigation by&nbsp; the fiscal had&nbsp; already been finished and the information filed,&nbsp; when the demand of the accused was made."</p></blockquote><p>This&nbsp; view was reiterated in&nbsp; People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Napagao&nbsp; (97 Phil., 785),&nbsp; decided on October 29,&nbsp; 1955, in the&nbsp; following language:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * * the legal duty of the provincial fiscal to notify the&nbsp; accused of the preliminary&nbsp; investigation, arises&nbsp; only after the&nbsp; latter expressly requests&nbsp; that&nbsp; said investigation be made in his presence. Counsel for defendants-appellees, in contending otherwise, stresses the fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the above quoted&nbsp; provision recites that 'to this end, he may,&nbsp; with&nbsp; due notice to the accused, summon reputed witnesses and&nbsp; require them to appear before him and testify and be&nbsp; cross-examined under oath by&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused upon the&nbsp; latter's&nbsp; request,' and&nbsp; 'that&nbsp; the attendance or&nbsp; evidence of absence or&nbsp; recalcitrant witnesses who may be&nbsp; summoned&nbsp; or whose testimony may be&nbsp; required by the&nbsp; provincial fiscal * * * shall be enforced by&nbsp; the proper process upon application&nbsp; to be&nbsp; made by the provincial&nbsp; fiscal to any Judge of the First Instance&nbsp; of the Judicial&nbsp; District Inasmuch,&nbsp; however, as the&nbsp; sentences referred to by counsel for&nbsp; defendants-appellees,&nbsp; are&nbsp; introduced by the phrase 'to&nbsp; this&nbsp; end', they are&nbsp; to be&nbsp; construed in&nbsp; relation&nbsp; to the&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; provision, namely, that the accused&nbsp; should make the corresponding request if he desires to&nbsp; be present&nbsp; at the investigation.&nbsp; The clause 'if&nbsp; the latter so requested', appearing in the&nbsp; second sentence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; above quoted provision of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 732 would be meaningless, if in all&nbsp; cases the fiscal is bound to notify and&nbsp; require the presence of the accused."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the petition must be,&nbsp; as it is hereby, denied with costs&nbsp; against the petitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is so&nbsp; ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
