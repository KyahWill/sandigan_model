				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a case&nbsp; for legal separation filed in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Pangasinan&nbsp; wherein on motion of the defendant, the case was dismissed.&nbsp; The order of dismissal was appealed to the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, but&nbsp; said Tribunal&nbsp; certified the case to this Court on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that there is&nbsp; absolutely&nbsp; no question of fact involved, the motion being&nbsp; predicated on the assumption as true of the very facts testified to by plaintiff-husband.<br><br>The facts of the case&nbsp; abridgedly&nbsp; stated are as follows: Benjamin Bugayong, a&nbsp; serviceman in the United States Navy, was married to defendant Leonila Ginez on&nbsp; August 27, 1949, at Asingan, Pangasinan, while on furlough leave. Immediately after their marriage, the couple lived&nbsp; with the sisters of the husband in said municipality, but before the latter&nbsp; left&nbsp; to report back to duty, he and his wife came to an agreement that Leonila would stay with his sisters who later moved to&nbsp; Sampaloc, Manila. After some time, or about July, 1951,&nbsp; Leonila Ginez left the dwelling of her sisters-in-law and4nformed her husband by letter that she had gone to&nbsp; reside&nbsp; with&nbsp; her mother in Asingan,&nbsp; Pangasinan, from which place she later&nbsp; moved&nbsp; to&nbsp; Dagupan City to study in a local college there.<br><br>As&nbsp; early as July,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; Benjamin Bugayong began receiving letters from Valeriana Polangco (plaintiff's sister- in-law) and some from&nbsp; anonymous writers (which were not produced&nbsp; at the hearing) informing him of&nbsp; alleged acts of infidelity of his wife which he did not even&nbsp; care to mention.&nbsp; On&nbsp; cross-examination, plaintiff&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that his wife also informed him by letter,&nbsp; which he claims to have destroyed, that a certain "Eliong"&nbsp; kissed her.&nbsp; All these&nbsp; communications prompted him in October, 1951 to seek the advice of the Navy Chaplain&nbsp; as&nbsp; to the propriety of a legal separation between him and his wife on account of the latter's alleged acts of infidelity, and he was directed to consult instead the navy legal department.<br><br>In August, 1952, plaintiff went to Asingan, Pangasinan, and sought for his wife whom&nbsp; he met in the house of one Mrs.&nbsp; Malalang,&nbsp; defendant's godmother.&nbsp; She came along with him and both proceeded to the house of Pedro Bugayong, a cousin of the plaintiff-husband, where they stayed and lived for 2 nights&nbsp; and 1&nbsp; day as husband&nbsp; and wife. Then they repaired to the plaintiff's house and again passed the night therein as husband&nbsp; and wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day, Benjamin Bugayong tried&nbsp; to verify from his wife the truth of the information he received that she&nbsp; had committed adultery but Leonila, instead of answering his query, merely packed up and left, which he took as a confirmation of the acts of infidelity imputed on her.&nbsp; After that and despite&nbsp; such&nbsp; belief, plaintiff exerted efforts to locate&nbsp; her and failing to find her, he went to Bacarra, Ilocos Norte, "to soothe his&nbsp; wounded feelings".<br><br>On November 18, 1952, Benjamin Bugayong filed in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan a complaint for legal separation against his wife, Leonila&nbsp; Ginez, who timely filed&nbsp; an answer vehemently denying the&nbsp; averments&nbsp; of the complaint and setting up affirmative defenses. After the issues were joined and convinced that a reconciliation was not possible,&nbsp; the court set the case for hearing on June&nbsp; 9, 1953.&nbsp; Plaintiff's counsel announced that he was to present 6 witnesses but after plaintiff-husband finished testifying in his favor, counsel for the defendant orally moved for the&nbsp; dismissal of the complaint,&nbsp; but the Court ordered him&nbsp; to file a&nbsp; written&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; that&nbsp; effect and gave&nbsp; plaintiff 10&nbsp; days to answer the same.<br><br>The motion to dismiss was predicated on the follpwing grounds:&nbsp; (1) Assuming <i>arguendo</i> the truth of the allegations of the commission of "acts of rank infidelity amounting to adultery",&nbsp; the&nbsp; cause of action, if any,&nbsp; is&nbsp; barred by the statute&nbsp; of&nbsp; limitations;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; That under&nbsp; the same assumption, <i>the&nbsp; acts charged hive&nbsp; been condoned</i> by the plaintiff-husband;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; That the&nbsp; complaint failed to state a cause of action sufficient for this court to render a valid judgment.<br><br>The motion to dismiss was answered by plaintiff and the Court, considering only&nbsp; the second ground of the motion to dismiss,&nbsp; i. e.,&nbsp; <i>condonation,</i>&nbsp; ordered the&nbsp; dismissal of the action.&nbsp; After the motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiff was denied, the case was taken up for review to the Court of Appeals, appellant's counsel maintaining that the lower court erred:<br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) In so prematurely dismissing the case;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) In finding that there was condonation on the&nbsp; part of plaintiff-appellant; and<br><br>(<i>c</i>) In entertaining&nbsp; condonation as a&nbsp; ground for&nbsp; dismissal in-asmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; same was not raised in the answer or in a motion to dismiss.<br></blockquote>As the&nbsp; questions raised in the brief were merely&nbsp; questions of law, the Court of Appeals certified the case to this Superiority.<br><br>The Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 97. A petition for legal separation may&nbsp; be&nbsp; filed:<br><br>(<i>1</i>)&nbsp; For adultery on&nbsp; the part of the wife and&nbsp; for concubinage on the part of the husband as <i>defined in the. Penal Code;</i>&nbsp; or<br><br>(<i>2</i>) An&nbsp; attempt by&nbsp; one&nbsp; spouse against the life of the other.<br><br>Art. 100. The legal separation may be claimed only by the innocent spouse,<i> provided there has been no condonation of&nbsp; or consent to the adultery or concubinage</i>.&nbsp; Where both spouses are offenders, a legal separation cannot be claimed by either of them.&nbsp; Collusion between the parties to obtain legal separation shall cause the dismissal of the petition.<br><br>ART. 102. An&nbsp; action for&nbsp; legal separation cannot be filed except within&nbsp; one year from and after the, date on&nbsp; which the plaintiff became cognizant of the cause and within five years from and after the date when such cause occurred.</blockquote>As the only reason of the&nbsp; lower Court for dismissing the action was&nbsp; the alleged <i>condonation</i> of the charges of adultery that the plaintiff-husband had preferred in the complaint against his wife, We will "disregard the other 2 grounds of the motion to dismiss, as anyway they have not been raised in appellant's assignment of errors.<br><br>Condonation is the forgiveness of a marital offense constituting a ground for legal separation or, as stated in I Bouvier's Law Dictionary, p.&nbsp; 585, condonation is the "conditional forgiveness or&nbsp; remission,&nbsp; by a&nbsp; husband or&nbsp; wife of a matrimonial offense <i>which the latter has committed</i>". It is to be noted, however, that in defendant's answer she vehemently and vigorously denies&nbsp; having committed any act of infidelity against her husband, and even if We were to give full weight to the testimony of the plaintiff, who was the only one that had the chance of testifying in Court and link such evidence with the averments of the complaint, We would have to conclude that the facts appearing on&nbsp; record are far from sufficient to&nbsp; establish&nbsp; the&nbsp; charge of adultery, or, as the complaint states, of "acts of rank infidelity amounting to adultery" preferred against the defendant.&nbsp; Certainly,&nbsp; the&nbsp; letter that plaintiff claims to have received&nbsp; from his sister-in-law Valeriana Polangco, which&nbsp; must have been too&nbsp; vague&nbsp; and&nbsp; indefinite as to defendant's infidelity to deserve its production in evidence; nor the anonymousi letters which&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; also failed to present; nor the alleged letter that, according to plaintiff, his&nbsp; wife addressed&nbsp; to him <i>admitting</i> that&nbsp; she had&nbsp; been kissed by one Eliong, whose identity was not established and which&nbsp; <i>admission</i>&nbsp; defendant had no opportunity to deny because the motion to&nbsp; dismiss was filed soon after plaintiff finished his testimony in Court, do not amount to anything that can be relied upon.<br><br>But this is not&nbsp; a&nbsp; question at issue.&nbsp; In this&nbsp; appeal, We have to consider plaintiff's line of conduct <i>under the assumption that he really believed his wife guilty of adultery.</i> What did he do in such state of mind.&nbsp; In August, 1952, he&nbsp; went to Pangasinan&nbsp; and looked for his wife and after finding her they lived together as husband and&nbsp; wife for 2 nights and&nbsp; 1 day, after which he&nbsp; says that he tried to verify from her the truth of the <i>news</i> he had about her infidelity, but failed to attain his purpose&nbsp; because&nbsp; his wife, instead of answering his query on the matter, preferred to desert him, probably enraged for being&nbsp; subjected to such humiliation.&nbsp; And&nbsp; yet he tried to locate her, though in vain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, do the husband's attitude of sleeping with his wife for&nbsp; 2 nights despite&nbsp; his alleged belief&nbsp; that she was&nbsp; unfaithful to him,&nbsp; amount to a&nbsp; condonation of her previous&nbsp; and&nbsp; supposed&nbsp; adulterous&nbsp; acts?&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; order appealed from, the Court <i>a quo</i> had the following to say on this point:<br><blockquote>"In the&nbsp; hearing of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; further testified as follows:<br><br>'Q.&nbsp; Now&nbsp; Mr. Bugayong, you have filed this action&nbsp; for legal separation from your wife.&nbsp; Please&nbsp; fell&nbsp; this Hon. Court&nbsp; why you want to separate from your wife?—A. I&nbsp; came to know that. my wife&nbsp; ia committing adultery,&nbsp; I&nbsp; consulted the chaplain&nbsp; and&nbsp; he told&nbsp; me to consult the legal adviser.'&nbsp; (p. 11, t. s. n.)<br><br>'Q.&nbsp; Did&nbsp; you finally locate her?—A. Four, days later or on the fifth day since my arrival she went&nbsp; to the house of our godmother and as a&nbsp; husband I&nbsp; went to her to come along with me in our house but&nbsp; she refused.'&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 12, t. s. n.)<br><br>'Q.&nbsp; What happened next?—A. I persuaded her to come along with me.&nbsp; She consented but I did not bring her home but&nbsp; brought her to the house of&nbsp; my cousin Pedro Bugayong." (p. 12, t. s. n.)<br><br>'Q.&nbsp; How long&nbsp; did you remain in the house of your cousin Pedro Bugayong?—A.&nbsp; One day and one night.'&nbsp; (p. 12, t.&nbsp; s.&nbsp; n.)<br><br>'Q.&nbsp; That&nbsp; night when you stayed in the&nbsp; house of&nbsp; your&nbsp; cousin Pedro Bugayong as husband and&nbsp; wife, did you sleep together?—A. Yes, sir.'&nbsp; (p. 19, t. s. n.)<br><br>'Q.&nbsp; On the next night, when you slept in your own house, did you sleep together also as husband and wife?—A.&nbsp; Yes, sir/&nbsp; (p. 19, t.&nbsp; g. n.)<br><br>'Q. When&nbsp; was that?—A.&nbsp; That was&nbsp; in&nbsp; August,&nbsp; 1952.' (p. 19, t.&nbsp; s. n.)<br><br>'Q. How&nbsp; many nights did you sleep&nbsp; together as husband&nbsp; and wife?—A. Only&nbsp; two nights.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (p. 19, t.&nbsp; s. n.)<br><br>"The New Civil Code of the Philippines, in its Art. 97, Hays:<br><br>"A petition for&nbsp; legal separation may be filed:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; For adultery on the&nbsp; part of the wife&nbsp; and concubinage&nbsp; on the part of the husband as&nbsp; defined in the Penal Code.' and in its Art. 100 it says:<br><br>'The legal separation may&nbsp; be claimed only by the innocent spouse, provided there has been to condonation of or consent to the adultery or concubinage.&nbsp; Where both spouses are offenders, legal separation can not be claimed by&nbsp; either of them.&nbsp; Collusion between the parties to&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; legal separation shall cause the dismissal&nbsp; of the petition.'<br><br>"A detailed examination of the testimony of the plaintiff-husband, especially&nbsp; those portions&nbsp; quoted above, clearly&nbsp; shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; there was&nbsp; a condonation on the part&nbsp; of the husband for the supposed 'acts of rank&nbsp; infidelity amounting to adultery'&nbsp; committed by defendant-wife.&nbsp; Admitting for the&nbsp; sake&nbsp; of argument&nbsp; that the infidelities amounting to adultery were&nbsp; committed by the&nbsp; defendant, a&nbsp; reconciliation was effected&nbsp; between her and the&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; The act of the latter&nbsp; in persuading her to come&nbsp; along with him, and the. fact that she went with him and consented to be&nbsp; brought&nbsp; to the house&nbsp; of his&nbsp; cousin&nbsp; Pedro Bugayong and together they slept there as husband and wife for one day and one night, and&nbsp; the further fact that in the second night they again slept together in their house likewise as husband and wife—all these facts have no&nbsp; other meaning in the opinion of this court than&nbsp; that a&nbsp; reconciliation between them&nbsp; was&nbsp; effected and that&nbsp; there was a condonation of the wife by the husband.&nbsp; This reconciliation occurred&nbsp; almost&nbsp; ten months after he came to know of the acts of infidelity amounting to adultery. "In&nbsp; Shackleton&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Shackleton, 48&nbsp; N. 3. Eq. 364; 21 Atl.&nbsp; 93§, it has been held&nbsp; that 'condonation is implied from sexual&nbsp; intercourse after knowledge of&nbsp; the other infidelity.&nbsp; Such acts necessarily implied forgiveness.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is entirely consonant with reason&nbsp; and&nbsp; justice that if the&nbsp; wife&nbsp; freely&nbsp; consents to sexual&nbsp; intercourse after&nbsp; she has&nbsp; full&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; of the husband's&nbsp; guilt,&nbsp; her&nbsp; consent&nbsp; should operate as a pardon of his wrong.'<br><br>"In&nbsp; Tiffany's Domestic&nbsp; and Family Relations, section 107 says:<br><blockquote>'Condonation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the&nbsp; forgiveness of a&nbsp; marital offense constituting a ground for divorce and bars the right to a divorce. But it is on the condition, implied by the law when not express, that the wrongdoer&nbsp; shall not again commit&nbsp; the offense; and also that he&nbsp; shall thereafter&nbsp; treat the other spouse with conjugal&nbsp; kindness.&nbsp; A breach&nbsp; of the&nbsp; condition&nbsp; will&nbsp; revive&nbsp; the 4 original offense as a ground for&nbsp; divorce.&nbsp;&nbsp; Condonation may be express&nbsp; or implied'.<br></blockquote>"It has been held in a long line of decisions of the various supreme courts of the different&nbsp; states of&nbsp; the U. S. that&nbsp; 'a single voluntary act&nbsp; of&nbsp; sexual intercourse by&nbsp; the innocent spouse after&nbsp; discovery of the offense is ordinarily&nbsp; sufficient to constitute condonation, especially&nbsp; as against&nbsp; the&nbsp; husband'.&nbsp;&nbsp; (27&nbsp; Corpus Juris Secundum, section&nbsp; 61&nbsp; and eases cited therein).<br><br>"In&nbsp; the&nbsp; light of&nbsp; the facts testified to by the plaintiff-husband, of the legal provisions above quoted,&nbsp; and of the various decisions above-cited, the&nbsp; inevitable conclusion is that the present&nbsp; action is untenable."<br></blockquote>Although no acts of infidelity might have been committed by the wife,&nbsp; We agree with, the trial judge that the conduct of the plaintiff-husband&nbsp; above&nbsp; narrated despite his&nbsp; belief that his wife was unfaithful, deprives him, as alleged the offended spouse, of any action for legal separation against the&nbsp; offending wife, because his said conduct comes within the&nbsp; restriction of Article 100 of&nbsp; the Civil Code.<br><br>The&nbsp; only&nbsp; general rule&nbsp; in American&nbsp; jurisprudence&nbsp; is that any cohabitation with the&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; party,&nbsp; after the commission&nbsp; of the&nbsp; offense,&nbsp; and with the knowledge or belief on&nbsp; the part of the injured party of its commission, will&nbsp; amount&nbsp; to conclusive&nbsp; evidence of condonation; but this presumption may be rebutted by&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; (60&nbsp; L. J. Prob. 73).<br><br>If there had been cohabitation, to what extent&nbsp; must&nbsp; it be to constitute condonation?<br><blockquote>Single voluntary act&nbsp; of marital intercourse between the parties ordinarily is sufficient&nbsp; to constitute condonation, and&nbsp; where the parties&nbsp; live in&nbsp; the same&nbsp; house,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; presumed that they live on terms of matrimonial cohabitation (27 C. J. S., section 6-<i>d</i>).<br><br>A&nbsp; divorce suit will not be&nbsp; granted for adultery where the parties continue&nbsp; to live together after it was&nbsp; known <land ><span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Blartin, 15 South 657;&nbsp; Day <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Day, 80 Pac.&nbsp; 974) or there is sexual intercourse after knowledge of adultery&nbsp; (Rogers <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rogers,&nbsp; 67 N. J. Eq. 534) or <i>sleeping&nbsp; together for a single night</i>&nbsp; (Toulson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Toulson, 50 Atl. 401,&nbsp; citing&nbsp; Phinizy <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Phinizy, 114 S. E.&nbsp; 185, 154 Ga. 199; Collins <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Collins,&nbsp; 193&nbsp; So. 702), and many others.&nbsp; The&nbsp; resumption of marital cohabitation as&nbsp; a&nbsp; basis of condonation will generally&nbsp; be inferred, nothing appearing to the contrary, from&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact of the living together as husband and wife, especially as against the husband (Marsh <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Marsh, 14 N. J. Eq. 315).<br></land ></blockquote>There is no ruling on this matter in our jurisprudence but we have no reason to&nbsp; depart from the doctrines laid down in the&nbsp; decisions of the various supreme courts of the United States above quoted.<br><br>There is&nbsp; no merit in the contention of appellant that the lower&nbsp; court erred in&nbsp; entertaining condonation&nbsp; as&nbsp; a ground for dismissal&nbsp; inasmuch&nbsp; as same was not raised in the answer or in a motion to dismiss, because in the case at bar, the question of condonation was raised in the second ground of the&nbsp; motion to dismiss.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that it was Hied after the answer and after the.hearing had been commenced, yet that motion serves to supplement the averments&nbsp; of defendant's answer and to adjust the issues to the testimony of plaintiff himself (section&nbsp; 4, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court).<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; and on&nbsp; the strength of the foregoing, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
