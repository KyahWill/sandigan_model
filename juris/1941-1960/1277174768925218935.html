				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition to review the decision of the Auditor General of the Philippines, 
denying the claim of Tan Se Chiong for the redemption of 208 money orders issued 
by the postmaster of Guiuan, Samar, between May 6 to December 11, 1943, in favor 
of petitioner as remitter, payee or indorsee, and aggregating a face value of 
P41,600.00. The Auditor General ruled that such money orders were not redeemable 
"for the reason that they were purchased after the official occupation of Samar 
Province by the Japanese invader.
<p>According to the March 18, 1952 indorsement of the Director of Posts 
(Petitioner Annex B), and which the Government does not dispute,--</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The second group of money orders were all issued in Guiuan, Samar on 
different dates in 1943. Guiuan was visited by the Japanese forces on July 23, 
1942, but they did not stay long. After the forces left, Guiuan was controlled 
by the guerrilla unit of Overall Commander Manuel Valle of the South Gueirilla 
Sector in Samar. The money orders were issued by Mr. Proceso Quijoy, who 
relieved the former postmaster on March 18, 1942, on the instruction of then 
Post Office Inspector Cayetano Buena, who apparently continued to discharge his 
duties under the guerrilla.</p>
<p>Postmaster Quijoy did not receive the corresponding amounts for these money 
orders. He received, instead, receipts from the municipal treasurer, some of 
which follows:</p>

<p align="right">(SGD.) JUAN RUIZ<br>Director of Posts"</p></blockquote>
<p>The redemption of money orders of the kind herein involved was dealt with in 
Administrative Order No. 1 (1947), of the Director of Posts, approved by the 
Secretary of Public Works ana Communications (43 Off, Gaz., No. 3, p. 831). 
Section 5 thereof reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"5. <u>Money orders issued during the war or on and after December 8, 
1941</u>. - Any money order regularly issued in the Philippines on and after 
December 8, 1941 (except those falling under paragraph 6) which is in good 
condition and regular in all respects, may be paid only at the Money Order 
Division of this Bureau upon statement under oath in triplicate of the claimant 
stating—</p>
<p>(a) His full name, address and occupation or profession;</p>
<p>(b) That the order was issued in the regular course of business at the post 
office indicated therein as the office of issue, for which legal currency 
(Treasury or Philippine National Bank notes or Government checks or warrant but 
not scrip money or emergency notes) was paid (section 831 [4], Service 
Manual);</p>
<p>(c) That the money order was not issued in payment of salary and/or bonus, or 
other obligations of the Government;</p>
<p>(d) That the post office where the money order was issued was at the time 
still under the control of the Commonwealth Government and the place where it 
was located was not yet occupied by the enemy.</p>
<p>(Note.—This statement must be corroborated by a certificate or statement 
under oath of the Municipal Mayor and the Municipal Treasurer. If the Municipal 
Treasurer is at the same time the Postmaster, the statement of the Principal 
Teacher of the local elementary school or the Chief of Police will 
do.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>The Solicitor General, on behalf of the Auditor General, correctly holds that 
Guiuan, Samar, does not come within requirement (d) above quoted; that is to 
say, the money orders were not issued by a post office "at the time (1943) was 
still under the control of the Commonwealth Government. and the place where it 
was located was not yet occupied by the enemy."</p>
<p>The fact that Guiuan, Samar, was occupied by Japanese forces only in July, 
1942 and that, in their absence the guerrilla forces assumed control until 1944, 
when the invader returned, does not mean that the place was not under affective 
belligerent occupation by the enemy. The point has been passed upon and decided 
by this Court in Co Kim Cham <em>vs</em>. Valdez, 75 Phil. 371, and Etorma 
<em>vs</em>. Ravelo, 78 Phil. 155. The Court held that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The presence of guerrilla bands in barrios and mountains, and even in towns 
of the Philippines whenever these towns were left by Japanese garrisons or by 
the detachments of troops sent on patrol to these places, was not sufficient to 
make the military occupation ineffective, nor did it cause that occupation to 
cease, or prevent the constitution or establishment of a <u>de facto</u> 
government in the Islands. The belligerent occupation of the Philippines by the 
Japanese invaders became an accomplished fact from the time General Wainwright, 
Commander of the African and Filipino forces in Luzon, and General Sharp, 
Commander of the forces in Visayas and Mindanao, surrendered and ordered the 
surrender of their forces to the Japanese invaders, and the Commonwealth 
Government had become incapable of publicly exercising its authority, and the 
invader had substituted his own authority for that of the legitimate government 
in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.</p>
<p>'According to the rules of Land Warfare of the United States Army, 
belligerent or so-called military occupation is a question of fact. It 
presupposes a hostile invasion as a result of which the invader has rendered the 
invaded government incapable of publicly exercising its authority, and that the 
invader is in position to substitute and has substituted his own authority for 
that of the legitimate government of the territory invaded.' (International Law 
Chiefly as Interpreted and Applied by the United States, by Hyde, Vol. II, pp. 
361-362.) 'Belligerent occupation must be both actual and effective. Organized 
resistance must be overcome and the forces in possession must have taken 
measures to establish law and order. It doubtless suffices if the occupying army 
can, within a reasonable time, send detachments of troops to make its authority 
felt within the occupied district.' (<u>Id</u>., p. 364.) 'Occupation once 
acquired must be maintained * * * . It does not cease, however, * * * . Nor does 
the existence of a rebellion or the operations of guerrilla bands cause it to 
cease, unless the legitimate government is reestablished and the occupant fails 
promptly to suppress such rebellion or guerrilla operations' (<u>Id</u>., p. 
365)."</p>
<p>(Co Kim Cham <em>vs</em>. Valdez, 75 Phil. 373-374).</p></blockquote>
<p>Like possession, therefore, belligerent occupation would not require that the 
occupant should have its feet continuously planted on every square foot of 
territory (cf. Ramos vs. Dir. of Lands, 39 Phil. 181) provided it maintains 
effective control and military superiority therein, being able to send, in case 
of attack, sufficient force to assert its authority within a reasonable time, as 
in the case of the British occupation of the Boer republics during 1901 
(Oppenheim, Int. Law, 6th Ed. Vol. II, pp. 340-341).</p>
<p>There is no proof that when the Japanese withdraw in 1942, they had no 
intention of returning; or that the retirement was coerced by military action of 
the guerrilla forces; or that the latter were able to resist the enemy's efforts 
to dislodge them and reoccupy the town. On the contrary, this record is clear 
that the guerrillas were only able to control Guiuan as long as the Japanese 
were not minded to return. In fact, the Japanese returned in 1944, and 
reoccupied the town without the guerrilla forces being able to prevent it. So 
that tha absence of a Japanese garrison in 1943 did not mean that the 
belligerent occupation had ceased or become ineffective.</p>
<p>Another point that militates against petitioner's recovery in found in his 
own affidavit of December 29, 1938, made at Guiuan, Samar (Exhibit roll, fol. 
5). Asked,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What kind of money, scrip or emergency notes (had) bean paid by 
you?"</p></blockquote>
<p>the petitioner answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As far as I can remember, those issued in Guiuan were of the Cebu Emergency 
notes, about P7,500.00 and the rest all in genuine money,"</p></blockquote>
<p>The requirement of Administrative Order No. 1, of 1947, par. 5(b), is that, 
to be entitled to redemption, it must appear that the money order was paid for 
in legal currency, "Treasury or PNB notes or government checks or warrants, 
<u>but not scrip money or emergency notes</u>". Hence, it was incumbent on this 
petitioner to clearly segregate and identify the money orders corresponding to 
the emergency notes he paid, and those that were supported by lawful 
consideration. Not haying done so, he can not be said to have complied with the 
redemption order (cf. Lichauco <em>vs</em>. Martinex, 6 phil. 597).</p>
<p>Petitioner also complains that the Auditor General rejected his reimbursement 
claim when that official allowed redemption in the similar cases of Juan R. 
Whalen and Loida N. Palanca, involving money orders issued in Culion, Palawan, 
after the capital of that province had already been occupied by the Japanese 
forces on May 18, 1942. But in the latter cases the money orders were purchased 
before the Japanese reached or landed in Culion itself to assert their 
authority; while in the case now before us, Tan Se Chiong purchased money orders 
after the enemy forces had entered and established their authority in Guiuan 
itself in 1942. Anyway, as the Solicitor General states in his brief (p. 10), 
—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. Assuming the facts to be as stated by petitioner in connection with 
the Whalen and Palanca claims, the most that can be said is that the Auditor 
General erred in allowing those claims, and such error on the part of the 
Auditor General is no reason for compelling him to make another error that would 
cost the government a much higher sum. Obviously, the equal protection clause of 
the Constitution does not require either the courts, the executive and the 
legislative departments, after having committed an error, to repeat the same 
error in subsequent similar cases, specially when no principle of estoppel is 
involved."</p></blockquote>
<p>The excision of the Auditor General is, therefore, affirmed, with costs 
against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J.</em>, and <em>Pablo, J.</em>, did not take part.</p></div>
