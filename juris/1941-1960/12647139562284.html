				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FRANCISCO .BUENAFE Y  CALUPAS,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The defendant-appellant, Francisco Buenafe y Calupas, was charged in the Court  of First  Instance of  Manila with the crime of forcible abduction, in that "on or about the 7th day of December, 1953, in the City  of  Manila, Philippines,  the said  accused, with the use  of a motor vehicle, did then and  there' wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously with  lewd designs,  abduct  the  undersigned, a woman, by pushing her into a taxi at the corner of Algeciras,  España,  this City, and carrying her away  against her  will."  After trial the  court  convicted  him  only  of acts of lasciviousness, and sentenced him to 6 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>,  with legal accessory penalties, and to pay the costs.  From this judgment an appeal was  taken  directly to  this  Court,  the  appellant  merely raising  the legal  contentions  that the  lower  court  erred in holding that the caresses of a lover  are acts of lasciviousness  and  punishable under the Revised Penal Code, and in  convicting  him  of  acts  of lasciviousness  under  the complaint  for  forcible abduction.   We are therefore concluded by  the  following findings of fact contained in  the appealed decision:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"According to the  testimony of  the  offended  party, while she was walking near  the corner of  Algeciras and España  Streets, she saw the accused alight  from  a taxicab and then he approached, grabbed, her  and lifted her into  the vehicle.  Inside, the accused embraced and kissed her and touched her  private parts and while she was struggling against the accused to free herself, she succeeded in opening the door of  the taxi and at the same time  she  leaped out and  fell in  a canal.  The  accused  went after  her  but she managed to  escape until she reached  the house of Sims at  No. 1103  Washintgon  Street.</p>
  <p>"From the evidence presented by the accused, it appears that he  and the  offended party, Dominga  Reyes  were  sweethearts as shown by  the letters  sent by  her  to  him  marked  Exhibits  2 to  13. Said  letters  show that  she often  asked  for,  and  received money from the accused for her needs at school and for her personal use; that they used to go out together  to dances  and movie houses, and that  they  used to  meet in the Science  Building  of  the  Far Eastern University.</p>
  <p>"In a letter of the offended party to the  accused dated December 2,  1953,  marked,  Exhibit 2, she asked  him to  be  at their  usual meeting place in the Science Building of the Far Eastern University the following Monday,  or  December 7, 1953.  In  that  letter, she stated that  she needed  some money for   Christmas  and  for her personal  expenses.  Accordingly, the accused met  her at the Science Building and in  the course of  their  conversation,  Dominga  told him that she needed  PSO.  The  accused  stated that  he  did not have  money  at that time but he  would try  to  secure the needed amount and  promised to give the money  to  her in  the afternoon of that day, and for that purpose, they agreed to meet on Algeciras Street after  lunch time. Accordingly,  he  arrived there in a taxicab and soon thereafter, the offended .party appeared and  boarded the vehicle.  While  they were passing  along  Espana  Street,  the offended party asked him  for the money  and he answered  that he had only P10 at that time.  The  accused  embraced and kissed her and took liberties with her person,  and  evidently because of her disappointment  in  not getting  the  amount  she  needed,  she struggled  against him  and  jumped  from the vehicle.  She  ran away  followed by  the  accused  until she  reached said house  of Sims where she  asked  for help.</p>
  <p>"The facts above  stated show that  the offended  party went voluntarily with  the accused in  the taxicab expecting  to get some money  from him as  usual, but  the  accused instead of complying with his  promise to give  her the amount of P50 told her  that he did not have the amount  and started caressing her.  She  put up  strong resistance, leaped  from  the  taxicab and freed  herself from  the  accused.   The facts disclosed  by the  evidence fail  to show  that the accused is  guilty of  forcible  abduction.  At most the acts done by the accused  constitute  acts of lasciviousness.  He took advantage of the occasion when Dominga was alone with him inside the taxicab and was tempted to  take  more than the usual liberties allowed a  lover.  If she  were in her  right mood,  she would perhaps not  have objected.  But  notwithstanding her objections  he  forced  his  attentions  upon  her until she ran  away to escape from  his unwelcome advances.  The  relation between  the accused and the offended party is to be taken into consideration in the imposition of the penalty."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appeal is  well founded.   Under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code any  act of lasciviousness  committed upon a person of either sex, is  punished by <span style="font-style: italic;">prision  correctional</span> if any of the circumstances  mentioned  in  Article 335 is present,  among which  is  the  use   of  force  and intimidation.   In the case at bar, although  the  trial court concluded that the appellant embraced and kissed,  and took liberties with the person of, the offended party against her strong  resistance, it did not expressly find that said appellant was prompted  by  lust  or lewd designs.   Indeed, considering that the incident took place in a taxicab while passing  along a  public thoroughfare and at about noon time, it is difficult to believe that the  appellant could have desired more than the ordinary outbursts  of one in love.  Even as regards the resistance put up  by the offended party, the trial court observed that she struggled against appellant because of her disappointment in  not receiving the P50 promised by him,—implying that she  resisted not because she  did not welcome appellant's caresses but because she  expected  him first to comply with his commitment.  To sustain the charge of abusos deshonestos, something more must appear than that,  with or without her consent, an ardent lover kissed and embraced for a moment a young woman  of whom he was  enamored,  (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Gomez, 30 Phil.,  22).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision  is  reversed and the appellant acquitted  with costs de oficio.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon,  Padilla, Reyes,  A., Jugo,  Bautista  Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
