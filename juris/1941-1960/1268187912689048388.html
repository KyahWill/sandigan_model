				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of La Union in its Civil 
Case No. 657 denying plaintiffs' petition for relief from another order of the 
same court dismissing their appeal from the main judgment for having been filed 
out of time.
<p>It appears that on August 21, 1952, plaintiffs Alejandro Rafanan, Josefina 
Rafanan, and Ernesto Rafanan filed a complaint against defendants Sixto Rafanan 
and Maria G. de Rafanan for the recovery of a parcel of land located in barrio 
Biday, San Fernando, La Union. On July 27, 1953, the Court below rendered 
judgment declaring the defendants to be the owners of the land in question. 
Notice of the decision was sent by registered mail and was received by counsel 
for plaintiffs on July 30, 1953; and on August 18, 1953, plaintiffs filed a 
notice of appeal. It was, however, only on August 20, 1953 that plaintiffs 
deposited their cash appeal bond, and their record on appeal was filed still 
later, on September 9, 1953.</p>
<p>On October 3, 1953, the Court a quo issued an order dismissing plaintiffs' 
appeal for having been filed out of time, and granting the writ of execution 
prayed for by defendants. Plaintiffs received copy of this order on October 8, 
1953, and the next day, October 9, they filed a motion to reconsider the same on 
the ground that the period was erroneously computed by the Court. On November 7, 
1953, the Court below denied their motion for reconsideration; copy of the order 
of denial was received by plaintiffs on November 13, 1953. Plaintiffs then filed 
with this Court on December 9, 1953, a petition for certiorari and mandamus, 
seeking to annul the order of the lower Court dismissing their appeal and 
denying their motion for reconsideration, but we dismissed said petition for 
lack of merit on December 11, 1953. Finally, plaintiffs filed with the lower 
court on January 7, 1954 a petition for relief, praying that the order 
dismissing their appeal be set aside, because the delay in perfecting the appeal 
was due to mistake or excusable neglect. This petition was again denied by the 
Court on February 15, 1954 for having been filed beyond the time provided for in 
section 3 of Rule 38. From this last order of denial, plaintiffs have prosecuted 
this appeal.</p>
<p>We agree with the Court below that the petition in question was filed out of 
time.</p>
<p>Under section 3 of Rule 88, a petition for relief must be filed within sixty 
days after the petitioner learns of the judgment or order complained of, and not 
beyond six months after such judgment or order was entered.</p>
<p>The order of dismissal of the appeal, now sought to be set aside, was 
received by plaintiffs-appellants on October 8, 1953. They, then, had sixty days 
from such receipt, or up to December 8, 1953, within which to present a petition 
for relief. Their petition was, however, filed .only on January 7, 1954, or 
thirty days too late.</p>
<p>Appellants contend that the running of the sixty-day period within which they 
could present a petition for relief against the order complained of was 
suspended by their motion for reconsideration filed on October 9 and denied by 
the Court only on November 13,1953. The question of whether or not the period 
prescribed by section 3 of Rule 38 for the filing of a petition for relief may 
be suspended or interrupted, has already been decided by this Court in the case 
of Palomarea, et al. <em>vs</em>. Jimenez, 90 Phil. 773. There we held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Considering the purpose behind it, the period fixed by Rule 38 is 
non-extendible and is never interrupted. It is not subject to any condition or 
contingency, because it is itself devised to meet a condition or contingency. 
The remedy allowed by Rule 38 is an act of grace, as it were, designed to give 
the aggrieved party another and last chance. Being in the position of one who 
begs, such party's, privilege is not to impose conditions, haggle or 
dilly-dailly, but to grab what is offered him."</p></blockquote>
<p>The applicability of this rule to the appellants is the more imperative 
because ,no reason is shown why the excusable negligence now alleged was not 
invoked in the motion to reconsider filed by them on October 9, 1953. The spirit 
of the Rules of Court is that all available grounds for relief should be invoked 
at one time (cf. Sawit <em>vs</em>. Rodas, 73 Phil., 310).</p>
<p>Considering, therefore, that the period prescribed by Rule 38 is 
non-extendible and never interrupted, the period within which appellants could 
have filed a petition for relief from the lower Court's order of October 3,1953 
dismissing their appeal, was not interrupted or suspended by their motion to 
reconsider of October 9, 1953, and so their petition was filed out of time. 
Wherefore, the lower Court did not err in denying the same.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
plaintiffs-appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angel, Labrador,</em> and <em>Concepcion, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
