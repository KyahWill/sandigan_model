				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">David Consunji and Fredesvinda A. Consunji were consignees of 247 cartons of 
medical supplies unloaded at the Port of Manila from the United States ex SS 
Lisholt on April 26, 1957. As arrastre operator, the Manila Port Service took 
charge of the merchandise, and in due course delivered to plaintiffs or their 
agent 243 cartons, thereby incurring a shortage of four (4) cartons.
<p>Wherefore this complaint in the Manila municipal court for the sum of P460.38 
representing the invoice value of the undelivered goods, plus damages and 
attorneys fees totalling P620.36.</p>
<p>The defense rested mainly on the failure of plaintiffs to file a claim for 
the shortage within 15 days, as provided in its Management Contract with the 
Bureau of Customs, which reads partly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * In any event the contractor shall be relieved and released of any and 
all responsibility or liability for loss, damage, misdelivery and or 
non-delivery of goods, unless suit in the Court of proper jurisdiction is 
brought within a period of one (1) year from the date of the discharge of the 
goods, or from the date when the claim for the value of such goods have been 
rejected or denied by the contractor, provided that such claim shall have been 
filed with the Contractor within 15 (fifteen) days from the date of the 
discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel."</p></blockquote>
<p>Submitted for decision upon a stipulation of facts, the case was decided for 
plaintiffs. Defendant appealed to the Court of First Instance wherein the 
parties reported the same stipulation. One witness for plaintiffs testified, and 
documentary evidence was introduced. Again, the court gave judgment for 
plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Defendants tendered for revision here the question of law concerning the 
15-day period. There is no denying that plaintiffs presented no claim to Manila 
Port Service within 15 days "from the date of discharge of the last package from 
the carrying vessel." But they maintain, and the lower court agreed with them, 
that the fifteen-day period was immaterial, because their action was filed 
"within one year from the date of the discharge of the goods." Appellees—and 
said court—would interpret the herein-above-quoted provision of the Management 
Contract to mean that "the arrastre contractor shall be relieved from liability 
for loss of goods unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Suit in the Court of proper jurisdiction is brought within a period of 
one (1) year from the date of the discharge of the goods, OR</p>
<p>"2. Suit in the Court of proper jurisdiction is brought within a period of 
one (1) year from the date when the claim for the value of such goods have been 
rejected or denied by the Contractor, provided that such claim shall have been 
filed with the Contractor within fifteen (15) days from the date of discharge of 
the last package from the carrying vessel."</p></blockquote>
<p>We do not think this interpretation may be sustained. Carriers or 
depositaries sometimes require presentation of claims within a short time after 
delivery as a condition precedent to their liability for losses. Such 
requirement is not empty formalism. It has a definite purpose, i.e. to afford 
the carrier or depositary a reasonable opportunity and facilities to check the 
validity of the claims while the facts are still fresh in the minds of the 
persons who took part in the transaction and the documents are still 
available.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Now, we see no reason why 
Manila Port Service —for whose benefit the provision was evidently inserted— 
should require prompt presentation of claim in one instance, while waiving it in 
the other. Bearing this in mind, we hold that the proviso about presentation of 
claim was intended to apply both to the case where suit is brot within one year 
from the date of discharge of the goods, and to the case where suit is brot 
within one year from the date when such claim is rejected. It is clear that the 
paragraph, while imposing a condition precedent to the filing of <em>any 
suit</em> for losses, at the same time gave the demandant (who has filed the 
claim) the option either to bring his action (in one year) without waiting for 
the contractor's resolution on his claim, or to wait for such resolution and 
then sue if it is unfavorable (in one year).</p>
<p>At any rate, a proviso (provided that such claim, etc.) refers to the clause 
or distinct portion of the enactment which immediately precedes it<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and restricts the general operation of the 
enacting part of the section to which it is attached or of the matter which 
precedes it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>The <em>matter</em> which precedes the proviso here discussed is the suit 
against the contractor, and the enacting part to which it (proviso) is attached, 
directs that "the qon-tractor shall be released from * * * liability unless suit 
* * * is brot within a period of one year etc." The proviso could not have 
referred <em>only</em> to "or from the date when the claim for the value of such 
goods have been rejected," because that portion is incomplete, expresses no 
directive, constitutes no enactment to be restricted by such proviso.</p>
<p>In this connection, we realize the seeming inequity of applying this 15-day 
proviso where the consignee comes to know the <em>damage or loss</em> only after 
the lapse of such 15-day period, for instance, where delivery by the contractor 
takes place 16 days after discharge of the last package from the vessel. And it 
might be unfair to apply the limitation where the claimant comes to know of such 
<em>condition precedent</em> only after the 15-day period. But such exceptional 
considerations do not come presently into play, plaintiffs having asserted none 
of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On the contrary, impliedly 
admitting knowledge of both the condition and the shortage within' the 15-day 
time<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>, they stood on the proposition, 
as stated, that having instituted suit within one year after the discharge of 
the goods from the carrying vessel, they had properly filed their action, 
notwithstanding no claim had been made within 15 days. Wherefore,, as their 
position turns out to be legally untenable, the judgment must be, and is hereby 
reversed, and the defendants are absolved from all liability. Costs against the 
appellees.</p>

David, Paredes</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
