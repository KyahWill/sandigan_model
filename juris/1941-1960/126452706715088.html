				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appellant was charged with the crime of qualified theft of personal property valued at  P15.20.  The information was filed in the Municipal Court of Manila on April 30, 1945.  On  May 25 appellant was convicted and sentenced to suffer six months and one day of imprisonment and to pay the costs.  On appeal, the Court of First Instance of Manila also convicted the accused, but reduced the penalty to two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em>.</p>
<p>At the  trial Alipio Orias and Lucero Nardo  testified for the prosecution.  For the defense, the accused testified. </p>
<p>Alipio Orias testified that he  is a private of the U. S. Army, Company A, 4th M. P. Bn., Tondo Camp,  assigned at Post No. 6,  located on Sande Street, Manila, on April 28, 1945.  He  remembered having seen the accused on  said date but on the date of the trial, June 21, he could  not identify him  any more, "because of the long time  that bad passed since then."  He arrested the accused between 3 and 4 p. m. on April 28 "because he was carrying at that time one  shirt and two undershirts, which belong to the government, besides a pair of shoes  that he was wearing," valued at P15.20. He turned him over to  the man in charge Sgt. Lucero Nardo.   He did not ask Vizconde where he  got  the things, because the  order he  received was to make arrest and turn over the arrested person to the man in charge.  Asked to explain why he remembered the case, but could not remember the face of the  accused, Orias answered "because we have records in our  office of this case."  When the accused was arrested he  was walking  with  several  companions   and  carrying  the  goods wrapped in a piece of paper.  The witnesses arrested him before  searching him.  Although  the   articles   were wrapped in a piece of paper, the accused was carrying the bundle without hiding it.  The  witness did not  ask any question from  the  accused, and the accused did not say anything  at  that time.  The two  undershirts  were new, the khaki shirt was slight'y used, and  the  pair  of  shoes were  used.   If the articles listed in  Exhibit 1  are shown to him, the witness can not recognize them.  The witness did not know from what place the accused took the articles. (Pages 1-4, transcript of stenographic notes.)</p>
<p>Lucero  Nardo testified  that  he  was  in  charge of the M.  P. guarding the camp at  Post No. 6.  On April 28 Orias turned over the accused to the Company Officer Ismundo.  The witness asked the accused where  he got the articles, "and he told me that he had picked them up," but the witness1 did not make any further investigation.  He does not remember exactly the accused, because "I am not familiar with his face"  and "I  have not seen him  since then."  The  witness further explain that he can not remember the face of the accused "because I have seen him only for about fifteen minutes, and it is very hard to remember his face."  Since April 28  many people have been arrested and investigated.   The witness cannot remember how many were arrested  either one or two days before he  testified.  The witness only  asked where he  got the articles, and "he told me  that he  picked them up, and I did not make  any further investigation."  (Page  5-7, transcript of stenographic notes.)</p>
<p>After the testimony of the two witnesses for the  prosecution, the fiscal made, among other things, the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It is true, Your Honor, that in the direct examination, the two witnesses for the  prosecution, whether  purposely or involuntarily, failed  to identify the  accused  in this case, although in  the  crossexamination hy the defendant's counsel, the last witness made reference to the  defendant." (Page 7, transcript of stenographic notes.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellant testified that on April 28 he was arrested.  On that afternoon  "before leaving my place of work,  I passed near the toilet and I saw a bag.  Inside the bag, I saw one shirt  and  two undershirts of  the Army."  The bag was located in a corner of the toilet room, exposed to the public view.  When he was arrested, the accused was telling the man who  arrested him, "that I had picked it up and I was going to turn it over to him, but he did not give me a chance to tell further, and he took me to his tent." As to the pair  of  shoes, he stated  to the Lieutenant who ordered him to  remove them from his  feet that "I told him it was  given  to me when I was  a guerrillero."  The accused took the things from the  toilet  room "because it was my intention  to  take  it to the M. P."  (Pages 7-9, transcript of stenographic notes.)</p>
<p>From the evidence presented by the prosecution, we are constrained to conclude that the prosecution failed to prove that the accused is guilty of the offense of qualified theft imputed to him.</p>
<p>The  bundle of  one khaki  shirt and two undershirts wrapped in paper was  picked up by him in a corner of the toilet  room  with  the  intention of turning them over to the M.  P.  The prosecution did  not offer any evidence to show the ownership  or source of said articles.  There is absolutely no evidence that they were stolen goods. The accused, in picking them  up, did not  have the <em>animus fruendi,</em> the <em>animus lucrandi</em>, nor the <em>animus furandi</em>, of a thief, but for the  legitimate  purpose of turning them over to the M. P.,  so  that the articles  may be returned to their owner. That intention was  proved by the accused, and not impugned or contradicted by any evidence in the record.</p>
<p>With respect to  the pair of shoes, there is  absolutely no evidence to show that they belong to any person other than the accused himself.  The accused testified,  without any contradiction, that said pair of shoes were given to him when he was a guerrilla.   The fact that the accused was wearing them at the time of his arrest and that they were used shoes, confirmed the testimony of the accused.  If they were stolen from the Army camp, they should be new or, if used, must be slightly used, as the khaki shirt in the bundle wrapped in paper, because the accused had only been working in Post No. 6 for four days, a  period within which he could have taken the new shoes and begun  using them.   Furthermore, there is not an iota of evidence that the  alleged offended party,  the U. S. Army, had found missing said pair of shoes  or any  one of the articles wrapped in paper and found by the  accused in a corner of the  toilet room.</p>
<p>We conclude that the accused is not guilty  of the offense of qualified theft imputed to him and,  with the revocation of the  appealed decision, he must be  acquitted.</p>
<p>Before leaving this case, we deem it necessary to direct attention to the third assignment of  error in appellants' brief, wherein it is  pointed  out that  the municipal  court transmitted the  papers of the case to the Court  of  First Instance on the eleventh day after the appeal was perfected, instead of within five days, as provided in section 7, Eule 119, of the Rules of Court, which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  7.  <em>Transmission of papers to the Court of First Instance, and fiscal.</em>â€”Upon such  notice being  so  filed or given,  as provided for in the preceding section, the justice of the peace or judge of a municipal court  shall within five days forward to the Court of First Instance  all  original papers and  a transcript of all docket entries  in  the  case.  He shall also  forward to the fiscal a  brief statement of the substance of the testimony of witnesses  testifying in the case.  The  provincial  fiscal shall  thereupon  take charge of the cause in behalf of the prosecution."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellant complains that by the violation of said section, his constitutional right to a speedy trial has been infringed.</p>
<p>We do  not believe that by the mere delay of four days the constitutional right of appellant for a speedy trial has been substantially  affected, but we can not let it pass as a matter  of principle, without any  comment on the violation of a mandatory  provision  of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>A period of five days is more than enough for the municipal court to transmit all  the  papers of an appealed case to the Court of First Instance.  We do not see any reason to justify the violation of the rule.  The municipal court  must  be among the first ones  which should  give example of strict compliance with the Rules of Court, if it must keep public confidence.  If the municipal court is allowed to violate a rule for four days, there is no reason why it could not violate it for four months, or even  four years.</p>
<p>The violation of the rule, which is a violation of the law of the land,  must not be  allowed to pass without our disapproval and censure, in order to avoid its recurrence.  If in the present case the delay in transmitting the papers to the Court of First Instance did not impair the  substantial rights of appellant, we can close our eyes to other cases where the delay caused real injustice and affected substantial rights of litigants.  It is our hope that in the future municipal and justice of the peace courts will comply with their official duties with  more jealousy and abide by the Rules of Court, by avoiding all violations such  as the one committed in the case at bar.  Nobody can impugn the wisdom of  the rule  requiring the municipal  judge  and justice of the peace to transmit the papers of an appealed case within a few days.   In the first place, it serves the purpose of making effective the constitutional guaranty of speedy trial.  In the second place, it is a deterrent against any abuse that an arbitrary judge may commit, by allowing a prompt revision of his actuation by a Court of First Instance.  A municipal judge or a justice of the peace,  who is not in duty  bound to transmit promptly the papers of an appealed  case, may defeat the  right  of a  party to a speedy trial and the right of litigants to obtain the proper redress against any error  or extra-limitation by which he may feel aggrieved.  Undoubtedly, the authors of the rules intended to avoid such undesirable situation.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed and appellant  acquitted  with  costs de  oficio.</p>
<p><em>Ozaeta, De Joya</em>,  and  <em>Hilado, JJ.</em>,  concur.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, J.</em>,  concurs  in the  result.</p>
