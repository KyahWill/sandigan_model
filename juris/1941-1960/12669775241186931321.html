				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Andrecito Bulalake and Florentino Acedillo were charged in the Court of First Instance of Rizal&nbsp; (in&nbsp; Crim. Case No.&nbsp; 7701)&nbsp; with the crime of&nbsp; murder, for the killingof Igmidio Maala, under&nbsp; the following information:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 28th day of February, 1958, in the municipality of Muntinlupa, province of Rizal, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of this Honorable Court the above-named accused, who&nbsp; are convicts confined in&nbsp; the New Bilibid Prisons by virtue of final&nbsp; judgments&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; against&nbsp; them, conspiring,&nbsp; confederating and&nbsp; mutually helping and aiding one another, with evident premeditation and treachery,&nbsp; all&nbsp; armed with deadly weapons, did then and there&nbsp; willfully, unlawfully and feloniously kill Igmidio&nbsp; Maala, also a convict confined in&nbsp; the same&nbsp; institution, by hitting, stabbing and striking him with iron pipes and ice picks, thereby inflicting him&nbsp; multiple serious physical injuries&nbsp; which directly caused his death;<br><br>"That the aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism&nbsp; is present in the&nbsp; commission of the crime in that the crime was&nbsp; committed after the accused have been convicted by final judgments&nbsp; and while they&nbsp; are serving the said judgments in the New Bilibid Prisons. "Contrary to&nbsp; law with the following aggravating&nbsp; circumstances;<br><br>"1. That the&nbsp; crime was committed&nbsp; with insult&nbsp; to&nbsp; public authorities;<br>"2. That the crime was committed&nbsp; by armed men or persons who insure&nbsp; or&nbsp; afford impunity;<br>"3. Use&nbsp; of superior strength or means was employed to weaken the defense;<br>"4. That the crime was committed where public authorities were engaged in the&nbsp; is charge&nbsp; of&nbsp; their duties."<br></blockquote>Upon&nbsp; arraignment,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; Bulalake,&nbsp; assisted by his&nbsp; counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>,&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Antonio Rodriguez,&nbsp; pleaded guilty to the charge and&nbsp; was, thereupon, sentenced by the court&nbsp; to&nbsp; suffer for the penalty of death, and to&nbsp; pay indemnity&nbsp; in the sum of P3,000.00 and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case is now before us for review, pursuant to the provisions of Section 9, Rule 118 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The new counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> appointed for&nbsp; the accused in this instance&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that the trial&nbsp; court erred&nbsp; in not taking such evidence as&nbsp; were&nbsp; available and&nbsp; necessary in support&nbsp; of&nbsp; the material allegations of the&nbsp; information, including the&nbsp; aggravating circumstances therein enumerated, for&nbsp; the purpose of establishing beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused and determining the nature and extent&nbsp; of the penalty to be imposed&nbsp; upon him citing in support of his submission, the case of U. S. <i>vs.</i> Agcaoili (31&nbsp; Phil., 92).<br><br>There is&nbsp; merit in the contention.&nbsp; In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Agcaoili </span>case. it appears&nbsp; that the&nbsp; accused was&nbsp; convicted of&nbsp; the crime of assassination, upon his&nbsp; formal plea of&nbsp; "guilty" when arraigned, and sentenced to death.&nbsp;&nbsp; No evidence in support of the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; of the information&nbsp; was taken at&nbsp; the trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elevated&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Court for review,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment of the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court was&nbsp; reversed and&nbsp; a new trial ordered with the following statement:<br><blockquote>"No evidence was taken at the trial, and after&nbsp; a careful examination of the whole record&nbsp; we&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; rid our minds of a reasonable&nbsp; doubt as&nbsp; to whether the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; did or did not&nbsp; thoroughly understand the&nbsp; precise nature and effect of his&nbsp; plea upon&nbsp; arraignment.&nbsp; We are&nbsp; not wholly satisfied that&nbsp; he understood that in pleading&nbsp; 'guilty' of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime charged in the&nbsp; information,&nbsp; he pleaded guilty to its&nbsp; commission marked&nbsp; with&nbsp; all&nbsp; the aggravating circumstances&nbsp; alleged therein, and.&nbsp; that the&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; prescribed&nbsp; for the commission of the crime charged in the information, in&nbsp; the manner and&nbsp; form in&nbsp; which it is there&nbsp; charged, is death.<br><br>"In response to a suggestion by the trial&nbsp; judge that he might withdrew his plea&nbsp; of guilty and&nbsp; substitute therefor a plea of not guilty,&nbsp; the accused said&nbsp; that he did not desire to do so because 'he was&nbsp; responsible for the death of&nbsp; two persons mentioned in the information.'<br><br>"We are inclined to think&nbsp; that while the&nbsp; undoubtedly intended on that&nbsp; occasion, as also when he entered his plea of guilty, to confess&nbsp; and admit&nbsp; that&nbsp; he took the lives of the persons mentioned in the information,&nbsp; he&nbsp; did not&nbsp; intend to admit&nbsp; that&nbsp; he committed the&nbsp; offense with the&nbsp; aggravating circumstances&nbsp; mentioned therein.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *<br><br>"While it is true that a judgment convicting and sentencing&nbsp; a defendant may lawfully be pronounced upon a solemn plea of 'guilty' in open&nbsp; court and on arraignment entered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the accused with full knowledge of&nbsp; the meaning and effect of&nbsp; his plea&nbsp; nevertheless,<span style="font-style: italic;"> where the complaint charges a capital offense,&nbsp; the possibility of misunderstanding or mistake in so grave a matter justifies and&nbsp; in most instances requires the taking of such available evidence in&nbsp; support of the allegations,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the information as&nbsp; the trial judge&nbsp; may deem necessary to remove all reasonable possibility that the accused might have entered his plea of 'guilty' improvidently, or without a clear and precise understanding&nbsp; of&nbsp; its meaning&nbsp; and effect."</span>&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>In the same case, attention was invited to the rule of practice recommended in the cases of U. S. <i>vs.</i> Talbanos (6 Phil., 541) and U. S. <i>vs.</i> Rota (9 Phil., 426)&nbsp; that<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * in all cases,&nbsp; and especially in cases where the punishment to&nbsp; be inflicted is&nbsp; severe, the court should be sure&nbsp; that the defendant fully understands the nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; the charges preferred against&nbsp; him and&nbsp; the character of the punishment to be imposed before sentencing&nbsp; him.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">While&nbsp; there is no law&nbsp; requiring it, yet in every case under the plea of guilty where the penalty may be death it is&nbsp; advisable for the&nbsp; court to call&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose of establishing the guilt and degree&nbsp; of culpability of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendan</span>t"<br></blockquote>It is&nbsp; of course true that the taking of such evidence is a matter&nbsp; left to the&nbsp; discretion of the trial court.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp; inasmuch as&nbsp; judgments of conviction imposing the extreme penalty of&nbsp; death are&nbsp; subject to review&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp; Court as law&nbsp; and justice shall dictate, whether the defendant&nbsp; appeals&nbsp; or&nbsp; not,&nbsp; which automatic&nbsp; review neither&nbsp; the Court nor the&nbsp; accused could waive or evade it would seem that the proper and prudent course to follow where&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; enters a&nbsp; plea of "guilty"&nbsp; to&nbsp; capital offenses specially&nbsp; where he is&nbsp; an&nbsp; ignorant person with little or no education, is to&nbsp; take testimony not only to satisfy&nbsp; the trial judge&nbsp; himself but to aid&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court in determining whether the accused really and truly understood and&nbsp; comprehended the&nbsp; meaning, full&nbsp; significance and&nbsp; consequences&nbsp; of&nbsp; his plea.<br><br>In&nbsp; the instant case, while it appears that the accused, with the assistance of his counsel <i>de oficio,</i> pleaded guilty to&nbsp; the&nbsp; information,&nbsp; voluntarily&nbsp; and spontaneously,&nbsp; the records&nbsp;&nbsp; do not disclose that its&nbsp; contents enumerating&nbsp; several aggravating circumstances, were read and translated or clearly explained to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither does it appear that he&nbsp; fully and completely understood the precise nature of the charges&nbsp; preferred&nbsp; against him and the consequences&nbsp; of his plea.&nbsp; No inquiry whatsoever was&nbsp; made by the&nbsp; trial judge in this respect notwithstanding&nbsp; the fact that the accused was assisted only by an attorney<span style="font-style: italic;"> de oficio</span> whose appointment by the court for&nbsp; this purpose might have been extended only on the date of the arraignment, as the records&nbsp; show that the one previously appointed, Atty. Lazaro C. Sison,&nbsp; did not&nbsp; appear during the arraignment.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; in&nbsp; line&nbsp; with&nbsp; our decision in the Agcaoili case, <i>supra</i>, the appealed judgment is hereby reversed, and the case is remanded for new trial to the court <i>a quo</i> which is&nbsp; also enjoined&nbsp; to&nbsp; follow&nbsp; the practice recommended by this Court in the Talbanos and Rota cases, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
