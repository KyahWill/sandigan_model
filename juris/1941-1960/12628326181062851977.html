				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On  February 27, 1956,  respondent City Attorney Luis B. Uvero filed with the Municipal Court  of  the City  of Naga,  Camarines Sur,  two informations  for gambling: one  against Cesar Vargas  and Shea An  Chun, docketed  as Criminal Case No. 5248, and another  against Cesar Vargas and Aniceta Zantua, docketed as  Criminal  Case No. 5249. In both  cases  the informations are  similar and read  as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about February  22, 1956, in the City of Naga, Philippines and  within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Cesar Vargas, owner of a gambling device, a slot machine wherein a  game is played and wagers  consisting of money are played and winning therein  depends wholly or chiefly upon chance, and accused Shea An Chun, owner and manager of the Shea's Lunch, Naga City, and as such having control and charge of  the same, confederating together and mutually helping one another,  did,  then  and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly permit and tolerate to be played therein said game  of chance or  hazard commonly known as 'Jackpot.' <br><br>"That on or about February 22, 1956, in  the  City of Naga, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Cesar Vargas, owner of  gambling devices, slot machines wherein a game is played and wagers  consisting of money are played and winning therein  depends wholly or chiefly upon chance and accused Aniceta  Zantua,  owner and manager  of the  Cosmos Restaurant, Naga City, and as such  having control and charge  of  the same, confederating together and mutually helping one another, did, then and there  wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly  permit and tolerate to be played therein said  game of chance  or hazard commonly known as 'jackpot'"</blockquote> Respondent Judge Vicente S. Tuason of said court gave due  course to said cases,  ordered the arrest  of the petitioners, and, after their plea of  not  guilty, set the cases for trial on  March 8,  1956.  Petitioners-appellants, however instead  of  going to trial on that day,  filed a motion to quash the information on  the  following grounds: <br><ol><li>That the City Attorney had no authority to  file the information ;<br><br></li><li>That the information  contained averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse or justification; and<br><br> </li><li>That the facts charged in the information did not constitute an offense.</li></ol>After proper hearing and  consideration of the memoranda submitted by the parties, the respondent Judge, on March 20,  1956,  denied  the motion to  quash for not  being well taken.  Not satisfied with  this ruling, petitioners-appellants filed  with the Court of First Instance  of Naga a petition for certiorari with injunction to secure the annulment of  the order of the respondent  Judge  denying petitioners' motion to  quash, to prohibit him from further hearing  the  aforesaid cases  on  the  ground that he  had no jurisdiction to try them, and to declare that respondent City Attorney had no authority to file the  aforementioned informations.  In the  petition, they  insisted  that the informations contained averments which, if true, would constitute a legal excuse  or justification, and  that the facts charged in the  informations do  not  constitute  an offense under existing laws; that under  paragraph N, Section 15 of Republic  Act No. 305 (the Charter of Naga City) the Municipal Board  has  authority  to regulate the operation and maintenance  of slot machines and to  fix the amount of the  license  fees  thereof,  and  pursuant  thereto,  the Municipal Board  passed and approved Ordinance No.  72, as amended  by  Ordinance No. 116, which fixed the license fees, so that the operation of the  slot machines within the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Naga was allowed and, therefore,  there  is no  cause of action against the petitioners; that, accordingly, the informations filed against them should be quashed and, consequently, the respondent Judge abused his discretion and exceeded his jurisdiction when  he  failed to  grant  their motion to quash  the informations. <br><br>Respondents herein answered the petition  alleging that the denial of the motion to quash by the respondent Judge was proper; that the slot machine mentioned in the informations was a gambling device—as it will be shown during the trial of the case—which falls  within the provision  of Art. 195  of the Revised Penal Code,  and is not the slot machine regulated by the Municipal Ordinance No. 72 of the City of Naga; and that the petitioners have still the remedy of appeal  against the order  of the respondent Judge dismissing the  motion  to  quash. <br><br>Thereafter the case was set for hearing, and after proper trial, the  lower  court, presided by Hon. Perfecto Palacio, denied the petition for the well-founded reasons stated in the  decision, which are  as  follows:<br><blockquote>"It appears from this evidence presented that the petitioners were accused  by the respondent, City Attorney Luis B. Uvero, of the violation of the gambling law  under the  provisions of the  Revised Penal Code, before the Municipal Court of  the City  of Naga, (Annexes A and B); that said petitioners filed a motion to quash said criminal cases before  said Municipal Court, (Annex C), on the following grounds:  that the  City Fiscal has no authority  to file the information; that the information, although,  it contains  averments which, if true, would constitute an offense,  (Annex C),  However, the respondent Judge denied said motion (Annex D), <br><br>"The petitioners now come, to  this Court and ask that it prohibits the City Attorney  of the  City  of Naga  from prosecuting them of the crime of gambling under the provisions  of the Revised Penal Code  in view of the fact that the provisions of Republic Act No. 305 known as the Charter of the City of Naga, particularly paragraph N of Section 15 thereof,  impliedly permitted  them to use slot machine in  the operation of gambling gams as they were authorized  by City Ordinance No. 72, series of 1950 of the  City of Naga which  regulates the use of said slot machine upon payment of a certain fee; and to declare the Municipal Court of the City of Naga presided over by Judge Vicente  S. Tuason without authority and jurisdiction to hear and decide said criminal cases.<br><br>"The only question to be determined here is whether or not, City Attorney Luis B. Uvero of the .City of Naga has authority, as such prosecuting officer,  to  prosecute  the  petitioners of the  offense of gambling thru the  use  of slot machine  in  view of the permission granted to them by Republic Act No. 305 and  the City  Ordinance No.  72, series  of  1950 of the  City of  Naga by allowing them to pay a license for  the  operation  of  the same  under  certain regulations, and whether  or  not  Municipal Judge  Vicente S.  Tuason has  jurisdiction to try and  decide said  criminal cases. <br><br>"Under the provisions of the  Judiciary  Act  of 1948,  (Sec.  87, Rep. Act No. 296)  municipal judges  and justices of the peace were vested with original jurisdiction  to try and  decide gambling cases. Likewise, the City Attorney of the City of Naga as prosecuting officer of said city, is  empowered and authorised, to prosecute crimes and violations of city ordinances of the City of Naga committed within the  territorial jurisdiction of  said City,  (Section 24, paragraph  (G) of Republic Act No. 305).  As  the petitioners allegedly violated the provisions  of the  gambling law,  (Art.  195  of  the Revised Penal Code), within the  City of Naga,  the  City Attorney of said city is perfectly within the authority granted him by law to  prosecute the persons who violated said law.  In like manner, the Municipal Court of the City  of Naga has the exclusive jurisdiction to try and decide said violations of  law as  granted it  by the  Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended. <br><br>"It is true that the petitioners  were permitted by City  Ordinance No.  72, series of  1950 to operate the slot machine in their establishments but  this fact  alone does  not  exempt  them  from  the . operation of the provisions of Art. 195 of the Revised Penal Code as amended, for the reason  that  the  slot machine which City Ordinance No.  72, series  of 1950, allowed them to operate by virtue of their payment of a license fee, is the slot machine which is used for  amusement,  and not the slot  machine used in gambling games. The Court cannot  subscribe to the theory of the  petitioners  that, because Republic Act No. 305, and City Ordinance No.  72, series of! 1950 of the  City of Naga, respectively, allowed them to operate slot machine  in  their establishments,  they are permitted or authorized to indulge in gambling thru the use of said device, for the reason that gambling is prohibited and  penalized by the Revised  Penal Code, and  as slot  machines are of many types, some of them being used and  operated  for  amusement  purposes,  and others are  used and operated for gambling purposes, as defined in Corpus Juris  Civiles, it is clear  that  the slot machine  referred to in Republic Act No. 305 and regulated, by City Ordinance No. 72, series of  1950, of the City of Naga, refers  to the  slot machine  used and  operated for amusement purposes only. <br><br>"Moreover, even if the petitioners were convicted by the Municipal Court of the  City of Naga for the  violation of the provisions  of Art. 195 of the  Revised Penal Code,  (Gambling: Law),  of  which they were charged in Criminal  Cases Nos. 5248 and  5249,  (Annexes A and B), still  they have the remedy of appeal,  and therefore, their petition  for certiorari and prohibition in this  case is without legal ground."  </blockquote>In this jurisdiction, the  only  assignment of error  is as follows: <br><blockquote>The lower court erred in not holding that there is  no law for which the petitioners may be  successfully prosecuted in  the light of the charter provision of Republic  Act No. 305, otherwise known as the Charter, of the City of Naga, and that Art. 195 of the Revised Penal Code cannot  be  applied. </blockquote>Carefully considered,  this  assignment of error provokes a question  which  constitutes a matter of  defense that should be presented in the trial of the cases filed against the petitioners in the Municipal Court and cannot be entertained  in this  appeal  for,  without proper evidence, the Court of  First Instance of Naga as well as  this  Court cannot  determine whether the facts involved  in the aforesaid criminal cases  No. 5248 and 5249 should really fall under the provisions of Republic Act 305 or under Art. 195 of the Revised Penal  Code.  On this score  alone, the present  case as  well as  the  appeal  taken against the decision rendered therein should be dismissed; but, besides the foregoing reasons, we find that the order of respondent Judge Vicente S. Tuason cannot be the subject matter of  certiorari with prohibition  for  it was  entered  with jurisdiction  and without abuse of discretion.  That order constitutes an incident in the trial of said criminal cases Nos. 5248 and  5249 in the  Municipal Court of Naga  City, and the determination of its correctness, if at  all, should be brought on appeal to the Court of First Instance of Naga, after the trial of the cases, and not on certiorari.  On the other hand, we find that  the  information  filed  against the petitioners aver facts which constitute an offense under Art. 195  of the Revised Penal Code; that they  contain no allegation which would constitute a legal excuse or justification of petitioners' responsibility for the violation of law charged against them in said informations, and we see no reason  why the respondent City Attorney could not validly file said informations which clearly charge a violation of law committed within the  jurisdiction of  the  Municipal Court of Naga City.  Evidently the order of respondent Judge Tuason denying petitioners' motion  to quash was well taken and could not be the subject of certiorari which is a remedy intended only to keep an inferior court within its jurisdiction  or to correct a grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Wherefore, finding no  error in  the decision  appealed from, the same is hereby  affirmed, with  costs  against the petitioners. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
