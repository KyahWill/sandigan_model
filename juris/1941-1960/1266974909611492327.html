				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by certiorari against a decision&nbsp; of the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; in Tenancy Case No. 39&nbsp; of Bulacan. From the decision appealed from it appears&nbsp; that petitioner herein Ciriaco San Antonio received from&nbsp; Pablo Valencia, deceased husband of Asuncion&nbsp; Espinola, the possession of a parcel of land&nbsp; containing three hectares&nbsp; for purposes&nbsp; of cultivation.&nbsp; At that time&nbsp; Valencia obtained by&nbsp; way of&nbsp; loan from San Antonio the sum of P550 at a yearly interest of&nbsp; 8&nbsp; cavans&nbsp; of palay.&nbsp; Besides cultivating the land on a share basis, San Antonio was also allowed to&nbsp; construct a&nbsp; house thereon.&nbsp; After the&nbsp; death&nbsp; of&nbsp; her husband,&nbsp; Espinola was&nbsp; able to pay the&nbsp; indebtedness, and in&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1953&nbsp; she filed&nbsp; this&nbsp; petition&nbsp; in the Tenancy Division of&nbsp; the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations, praying that she be allowed to work the land herself with her two sons, claiming that the latter were able&nbsp; to&nbsp; do the work&nbsp; of cultivation and that&nbsp; she had sufficient number&nbsp; of carabaos inherited from&nbsp; her parents&nbsp; with which&nbsp; to work the land. San Antonio opposed the petition,&nbsp; alleging that her claim that she and&nbsp; her children could&nbsp; cultivate the&nbsp; land and that they had carabaos were false.&nbsp; In further support of her petition to get back the land; Espinola further alleged that the land was given to San Antonio in consideration of the loan and not by&nbsp; virtue of a contract of tenancy.&nbsp; This claim was found&nbsp; to&nbsp; be untrue by the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations, which&nbsp; held&nbsp; that a contract of tenancy existed. However, it held'that Espinola had the rights to get back her property for the purpose&nbsp; of cultivation by herself and her children, declaring in the decision as follows:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"<em>In view of all&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing,</em> petitioner Asuncion&nbsp; Espinola is hereby granted authority&nbsp; to eject respondent Ciriaco San Antonio from the landholding in question located at&nbsp; San Isidro, Paombong, Bulacan,&nbsp; effective at the close of the agricultural year 1954-1955, subject to the condition&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petitioner and&nbsp; her&nbsp; two sons shall work said&nbsp; landholding, and subject,&nbsp; furthermore,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the provisions of Sections 21 and 22 of Act No. 4054, as amended. "Should the petitioner and her sons fail&nbsp; to work the land&nbsp; and instead entrust the&nbsp; cultivation thereof to another person, the Respondent&nbsp; shall, upon complaint to and after due hearing by&nbsp; this. Court, be reinstated as&nbsp; tenant thereon with&nbsp; all the rights accorded and obligations imposed by law."&nbsp; (p. 12 of the decision.)</p></blockquote><p>Both parties were not satisfied with the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; San Antonio presented a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration on January 5,&nbsp; 1955, which the court in bane denied.&nbsp; Espinola on her&nbsp; part presented&nbsp; an earlier motion for reconsideration. As there was&nbsp; delay in&nbsp; the enforcement of the decision as&nbsp; to the possession of the land, Espinola presented an&nbsp; urgent&nbsp; motion dated March&nbsp; 26,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; alleging that inasmuch as the agricultural year 1954-1955 had ended and&nbsp; San Antonio had refused to give up the land and give her share in the harvest, that the court order San Antonio to deliver to her the&nbsp; whole harvest for the said year 1954-1955.</p><p>The motion&nbsp; for reconsideration that Espinola filed was dated October 27, 1954 and&nbsp; it questions the correctness of the finding&nbsp; of the court to the effect that&nbsp; the relationship between her and San Antonio was&nbsp; that of landlord and&nbsp; tenant and not that of borrower and lender as she had contended.&nbsp; At a hearing of the motions for reconsideration filed by both parties, Espinola asked the court to "dismiss her motion&nbsp; for reconsideration."&nbsp;&nbsp; The court made no ruling on this motion&nbsp; for dismissal&nbsp; until June 27, 1955. At that time&nbsp; Republic Act No. 1267, which was&nbsp; approved and took effect on June 14, 1955 had already taken effect. Taking advantage of the passage of said law, San Antonio filed his present&nbsp; petition, alleging that the Court of Industrial Relations had lost jurisdiction over the case and&nbsp; had no authority&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 27, 1955&nbsp; to grant the motion&nbsp; for dismissal&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; filed&nbsp;&nbsp; by Espinola, and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; findings and conclusion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court &amp;f Industrial,Relations as to the capacity of Espinola and her sons to&nbsp; cultivate the land are false and not&nbsp; justified by the evidence.</p><p>We&nbsp; can not review $he findings&nbsp; of fact made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations as to the ability and right of Espinola to cultivate the property and her consequent right, to" the&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land in question.&nbsp; Under the law only questions of law may be raised and appealed from the decision of the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations to this Court:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"SEC.&nbsp; 13. Appeal may "be taken from an order or decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations promulgated&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of I3iis&nbsp; Act&nbsp; and a review of such order&nbsp; or decision may be obtained in the Supreme Court by filing in such court within fifteen days from receipt&nbsp; of notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; such order&nbsp; or decision a written petition&nbsp; praying that it be&nbsp; modified&nbsp; or set aside in whole or in part.&nbsp; The review&nbsp; by the court shall be limited to questions&nbsp; of law, and findings of&nbsp; fact when&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision is not supported by substantial evidence."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 1267, as&nbsp; amended by Republic&nbsp; Act No. 1409.)</p></blockquote><p>The only valid issue before us, therefore, is the validity of the order of the Court of Industrial Relations of June 27, 1955, approving the supposed "dismissal" of the motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; filed by Espinola.&nbsp; The&nbsp; importance of this question&nbsp; lies in the fact&nbsp; that as San Antonio&nbsp; had not&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from the decision of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations the&nbsp; judgment rendered by that court would be final and executory if the supposed&nbsp; "dismissal"&nbsp; of the motion&nbsp; for reconsideration filed by Espinola is&nbsp; valid, as it was only because of the motion for reconsideration that the judgment rendered by the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations had not and could not be declared final and executory.</p><p>The motion for reconsideration&nbsp; in&nbsp; question is not attached to the record, altho it is admitted that it&nbsp; was filed for the&nbsp; purpose of questioning the finding of&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court that the&nbsp; relationship between&nbsp; Espinola&nbsp; and&nbsp; San Antonio is that of landlord and tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name given to the motion seems to be incorrect.&nbsp; It is called a "motion for dismissal"&nbsp; of her&nbsp; motion;&nbsp; it was&nbsp; in fact and&nbsp; in&nbsp; law a withdrawal of a motion for&nbsp; reconsideration.&nbsp; The import of the withdrawal of the&nbsp; motion for reconsideration is in conformity to the judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; Such conformity to the judgment and willingness to&nbsp; abide by its terms and conditions do not need the court's&nbsp; approval.&nbsp; The presentation of the motion to the court is sufficient to&nbsp; make it&nbsp; effective&nbsp; even without its (court)&nbsp;&nbsp; approval.&nbsp; As the court's&nbsp; approval was not necessary the grant thereof was a superfluity and&nbsp; produced no effect at all&nbsp; upon the status of the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The objection raised by the&nbsp; petitioner herein that the court had no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; on the matter after the approval of Republic Act No. 1267 avails&nbsp; him nothing.&nbsp; His petition for the annulment of&nbsp; the said order and&nbsp; the transfer of the case to&nbsp; the Agrarian Court&nbsp; is,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; without merit.</p><p>The&nbsp; petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; denied,&nbsp; and the writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction issued in this case is&nbsp; hereby dissolved&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against the petitioner.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Paddlla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L. Endencia, </em>and <em>Felix, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
