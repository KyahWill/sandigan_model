				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain respondents Judge of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila and De Santos Agricultural Development, 
Inc., from further proceeding in Civil Case No. 36377, entitled "De Santos 
Agricultural Development, Inc., plaintiff, <em>vs</em>. Ricardo L. Castelo, 
etc., el al., defendants."
<p>It appears that in Tenancy Case No. 4971-R of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations, Mariano Acosta, et al., filed a petition praying for a readjustment 
of the sharing ratio governing their tenancy relationship with Hacienda de 
Santos No. 5 situated in several municipalities of the province of Nueva Ecija 
and for other sundry readjustment in connection with said relationship. The 
petition made as party respondents the hacienda itself and one Alberto de Santos 
as manager of the hacienda.</p>
<p>The case was not tried on the merits but was submitted to arbitration upon 
direction of the President of the Philippines. On August 5, 1954, Judge Roldan, 
presiding judge of the Court of Industrial Relations, who was designated as 
arbiter, rendered his award ordering that a reliquidation be made in accordance 
with certain conditions and findings he made therein. On the basis of the 
reliquidation made, the Agrarian Court on January 10, 1958 issued an order 
awarding in favor of the tenants whose names appear listed therein, certain 
amounts of palay that were found to be payabje to them, and ordering respondents 
to make delivery of the palay in accordance with the award. This order not 
having been complied with, the Agrarian Court directed that a writ of execution 
be issued and, on March 12, 1958, the clerk of court acted accordingly by 
requiring the provincial sheriff to collect from respondents the amounts of 
palay adjudicated to the tenants, or the money equivalent thereof, and to "levy 
upon the properties of the above-named respondents, both movable and real and 
cause to be collected therefrom the total amount due to the petitioners under 
the aforementioned order dated January 10, 1958." Protesting the enforcement of 
the writ of execution against him personally, Alberto de Santos filed a motion 
with the agrarian court praying that the fwrit be quashed insofar as it requires 
that a levy be made upon his own personal properties since he is not involved in 
the case in his personal capacity, but only as manager of the hacienda. This 
motion, however, was denied, whereupon Alberto de Santos brought the case to 
this Court through a petition for review on certiorari. (G. R. No. L-13785.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> Speaking thru Justice Bautista Angelo, we 
sustained the petitioner's claim in a decision promulgated on October 20, 1959, 
and there said, among other things, that "enough properties that may be levied 
upon belonging to the hacienda can be ascertained and determined with little 
diligence and discernment without implicating properties of a person who is 
foreign to the case."</p>
<p>In the meantime, herein respondent De Santos Agricultural Development, Inc., 
a domestic corporation organized sometime in 1955, filed a third party claim 
against the provincial sheriff of Nueva Ecija claiming ownership of the palay 
which the latter had levied upon. Alleging that the sheriff, despite the third 
party claim, threatened to proceed with the sale of the palay, respondent 
corporation instituted the present'proceedings for injunction before the Court 
of First Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 36377) against the sheriff and the 
petitioners Manuel Acosta, et al. As prayed for, a preliminary writ was issued 
restraining the provincial sheriff of Nueva Ecija: from further proceeding with 
the execution of the judgment in the tenancy case pending determination of the 
ownership of the palay levied upon.</p>
<p>In due time, the defendants, herein petitioners, filed their answer with a 
counterclaim and also moved for the dissolution of the writ of preliminary 
injunction on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and lack of cause of action. 
Acting upon the motion, the respondent Judge promulgated an order providing for 
the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction upon the filing by 
petitioners of a bond in favor of the respondent corporation in the sum of 
P20,000.00. Of this order, both parties asked for reconsideration, the 
respondent corporation maintaining that Felipe de Santos, who died long before 
the filing of Tenancy Case No. 4971-A, was named therein as the owner of 
Hacienda de Santos No. 5 so that the judgment rendered in said case was a 
judgment against him which cannot be enforced against his heirs.</p>
<p>In an order promulgated after hearing on July 19, 1958, the respondent Judge 
found that "the heirs of Felipe de Santos should have been the respondents in 
the C.A.R. case" inasmuch as when the petition in the tenancy case was filed on 
December 22, 1953, they were the true owners of the family hacienda (Hacienda de 
Santos No. 5) the same having been inherited by them from Felipe de Santos upon 
the latter's death on September 4, 1945; that the said heirs "are the sole 
stockholders of the plaintiff corporation"; and that "their only contribution to 
the capital of the corporation is the land involved in the C.A.R. case which 
they inherited from Felipe de Santos". The respondent Judge, therefore, held 
that "this is one instance where the corporate fiction should be set aside and 
the corporation and its stockholders should be considered one and the same 
person. The corporation may not be used as an instrument to prevent the 
execution of the judgment of the C.A.R. case." However, said respondent Judge 
refused to reconsider its order or to grant petitioners' prayer that the 
preliminary writ be dissolved without requiring them to post a bond. Hence, the 
present petition for a writ of prohibition.</p>
<p>We find the petition to be meritorious.</p>
<p>Considering the findings of the respondent Judge, from the evidence already 
presented, that the heirs of the deceased Felipe de Santos are the sole 
stockholders of the respondent corporation and their only contribution to the 
capital of said corporation is the hacienda involved in the tenancy case which 
they inherited from Felipe de Santos, and said respondent Judge being also of 
the opinion "that this is an instance where the corporate action should be set 
aside and the corporation and its stockholders should be considered one and the 
same person," and that the "corporation may not be used as an instrument to 
prevent the execution of the judgment of the C.A.R. case," it is difficult to 
understand why the petition for injunction was ever entertained at all.</p>
<p>Counsel for the respondent corporation maintains that the judgment "obtained 
against Felipe de Santos," a deceased person, is not enforceable against his 
heirs who are not made parties thereto. It will be recalled, however, that the 
petition in the tenancy case made as party respondents the hacienda itself and 
Alberto de Santos, one of the heirs of the deceased, in his capacity as general 
manager of the hacienda. Needless to say, the judgment rendered against said 
general manager would be valid and binding as against whoever are the owners of 
the hacienda. In this connection, it should be stated that the award sought to 
be executed was made as early as August 5, 1954, whereas the respondent 
corporation was organized and registered by the heirs of Felipe de Santos as 
sole stockholders therein only on May 17, 1955.</p>
<p>Without mentioning the fact that there appears to be a tenancy relationship 
between the respondent corporation and herein petitioners who are working in 
Hacienda de Santos No. 5' as tenants, it would also appear that the respondent 
Judge has acted outside of his jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of courts of first 
instance to issue writs of injunction is defined and limited in the Judiciary 
Act of 1948 (Republic Act No. 296, as amended), which provides in its section 
44(n) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 44. <em>Original Jurisdiction</em>.-Courts of First Instance shall have 
original jurisdiction:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"(n) Said courts and their judges, or any of them, shall have power to issue 
writs of injunction, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, quo warranto and habeas 
corpus in their respective provinces and districts, in the manner provided in 
the Rules of Court."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under section 2, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, a preliminary injunction may 
be granted by the Judge of the Court of First Instance 'in any action pending in 
his district". These provisions clearly show that the jurisdiction or authority 
of courts of first instance to control or restrain acts by means of the writ of 
injunction is limited to acts which are being committed or about to be committed 
within the territorial boundaries of their respective provinces and 
districts.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ of prohibition prayed for is granted. Costs against the 
respondent corporation.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ</em>., concur.</p>
<p><em>Writ granted</em>.</p>
