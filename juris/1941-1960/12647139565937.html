				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Detained  in  jail, Teofilo  Anchita, 30, awaits the result of his appeal from the  judgment of the Quezon court of first  instance  sentencing  him  to life  imprisonment  for having taken part in the forcible abduction  and rape of Juanita Verdy, 16, in Sariaya, same province. We have  reviewed the evidence, carefully noting the testimony of the witnesses, especially in view of the close analysis which counsel-de-oficio attempted, with commendable diligence.  As we read it, in the evening of January 25, 1954 in  Barrio Balubal, Sariaya,  Juanita Verdy, her sister Virginia  and the  latter's husband Eduardo Sanico were roused from their  slumber by  some male visitors who turned  out to be Tomas  Quitain, Domingo  Dichoso,, Teofilo Anchita, Eusebio Lorena, Gregorio Abuel, Antonio Laguartilla  and Gregorio  Briones.  Admitted  into  the dwelling, the new comers were soon drinking wine with coca-cola in  the company  of  Eduardo  Sanido.   After  a while, Domingo Dichoso informed Virginia Verdy that he and  his companions  had  come to  take Juanita to  her father,  Gabriel  Verdy, at  the tetter's request.   Sensing danger, Virginia refused  to let her sister go; wherefore, Domingo Dichoso threatened to bring Juanita with them by forcible means.  Upon hearing this, Juanita ran down the stairs to the neighboring residence of Isabel Sanico. She was unluckily detected by Domingo Dichoso  and  To mas  Quitain who sprinted after her, grabbed her, and then dragged her to  a nearby  forest,  (sitio Nacoco) followed  by Teofilo Anchita, Gregorio Abuel and  Gregorio Briones.   There she was brutally ravished, first by Tomas Quitain and afterwards by Domingo Dichoso   Details are omitted,  inasmuch as<em> these two have  pleaded guilty </em>and are now serving a life sentence.  It is however necessary to describe the role played by herein appellant.  According to Juanita Verdy, when she was struggling against Tomas Quitain,  with the latter on top of her, unable to consummate  the sexual act,  this  appellant,  (either  to  help  his brother-in-law (Tomas) or to give vent to lewd  desires),. inserted  his fingers in her  private part and  stretched it wide open, thereby enabling Tomas to  accomplish totat penetration.</p>
<p>After  being twice abused, Juanita  was  conducted  to the house of  Tito Quitain.   Again, the other subsequent events need not be  recounted, inasmuch as  by the pleas to guilt, the reality of the assault upon Juanita is now beyond  dispute.  It  is enough to add that the next day Juanita submitted herself to physical examination at the Memorial Hospital in Lucena, Quezon; and that the physician found positive  signs of  recent  defloration: spermatozoa and lacerated hymen, bleeding at the slightest touch.</p>
<p>On the same day she subscribed a complaint for kidnapping  with rape, naming seven  persons  among them Tomas Quitain, Domingo Dichoso and  herein  appellant, who was described  as  the "son-in-law  of Tito Quitain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Before the justice of the peace she swore to an affidavit in Tagalog  on the same day wherein  she told her agonizing experience, omitting some details.   At the trial,  she recounted  the  same  story, filling  in the gaps which  her previous sworn statement had not sufficiently covered.  A searching cross-examination, far  from shaking it, evinced all the more her sincerety and truthfulness,  revealing in measured indignation  the  heinous  offense  committed against  her chastity.</p>
<p>"Not  guilty" said Teofilo Anchita.  "In fact I was not at or near  the place:  I was asleep at the  time  in the house of my  father-in-law  Tito  Quitain".    The  latter swore to the same effect.  Yet he proved to be unreliable, because  he  affirmed  that Tomas  Quitain was likewise there; whereas Tomas was admittedly elsewhere, criminally assaulting Juanita.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Virginia Verdy affirmed that Anchita had joined the group; and there  is no reason to question the testimony of the two  sisters—no animosity between them and this defendant  having  been shown.</p>
<p>Of course  we noticed that Domingo  Dichoso declared in open court, "Teofilo Anchita was not with us".   However, being the leader of  the  gang, it was natural for Dichoso  to whitewash his  crime  pals; his credibility can not be relied upon.  It is true, he admitted to having been accompanied by all  the other co-accused, except  Anchita; but there was method in  such admission: it was harmless, because he and Quitain had already pleaded guilty, Lorena and  Laguartilla had been absolved, and  Juanita had declared that Gregorio Briones and Gregorio Abuel had done nothing  to  her.</p>
<p>We have no doubt all in all,  that Teofilo Anchita, took part in  the sexual  assault. At this juncture it may be stated, we were momentarily stumped by his point raised in the counsel's  brfef: it  was physically impossible for Anchita  to be stretching,  with both hands, Juanita's  organ while Tomas Quitain was on top of her striving for sexual contact,  her legs being held by Dichoso  and others.   She said Quitain had raised himself a bit; but had not invited Anchita's help.  The doubt however  proved unimportant, because with two hands or one hand<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the accused inserted his  fingers  in the woman's  organ,   and  widened  it. Whether he acted out of  lewdness or to  help his brother-in-law consummate  the act, is immaterial:  it was both, maybe.   Yet surely,  by his conduct, this prisoner conspired and  cooperated, and is guilty.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,  his  crime<em> is not</em>  kidnapping  with  rape, but forcible abduction with rape.  When the violent taking of a woman is motivated by lewd designs—as in this case— forcible abduction under  article 342 of the  Revised  Penal: Code is  the offense. When it  is  not so motivated,  such taking constitutes kidnapping under article 267 as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>One offense is against chastity,  the other against personal liberty.</p>
<p>Now, the penalty of abduction is less than that of kidnapping.  Maximum for  the  first  is 20 years; for  the second, death.  Nevertheless, this gives appellant no reason to rejoice;  the crime was forcible abduction  <em>with two rapes</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of which he is responsible as co-principal. Rape is penalized with reclusion temporal, like forcible abduction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Maximum penalty for the rapes should be imposed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  not only  because complicated  with  abduction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  but also on account of night time.</p>
<p>Wherefore, declaring the appellant to be guilty of forcible abduction with two rapes, he is  sentenced to  20 years of reclusion  temporal  for each  rape,  total 40 years.  He should be credited with his preventive imprisonment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  No indemnity is ordered because the offended party reserved the right to file a separate complaint for damages.   Costs against appellant.  So ordered.</p>
