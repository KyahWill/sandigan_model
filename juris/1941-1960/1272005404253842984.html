				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The purpose of this petition for a writ of certiorari is to secure a review by this court of certain  proceedings had in the Court of Appeals in Criminal Case No. 33757 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled "People of the Philippine Islands <i>vs</i>. Sio Go, Ang Gioc,  Gang Kan, Kee  Ya and Chua Chui."<br><br>Briefly  stated, the pertinent facts which gave rise to this case are as follows:  About  fifteen years ago,  that is,  on October 30, 1926, the respondent Ang Gioc, together with Sio Go, Gang Kan, Kee Ya  and Chua Chui, was charged with the crime of frustrated murder in  the Court of First Instance of Manila.  On November 5, 1926, he was released on bail.   After a protracted  trial,  which  lasted  several months, Ang Gioc and one of his co-accused, Sio  Go, were found guilty and sentenced to twelve years and one day of <i>cadena temporal</i>, with the accessories of the law, and to  indemnify the offended party in the sum of P1,100.   Ang Gioc and his sureties were duly notified to appear before the court on March 28,  1928, for the reading of  the sentence,  but the former failed to appear  and thereupon the  trial judge ordered his arrest and the confiscation of the bond furnished for his temporary release.<br><br>The order of arrest could not be served on Ang Gioc because, according to the police authorities, he had escaped to China.   The record shows that his bondsmen  were given more than the usual period of time  (four months) to locate Ang Gioc,  but they failed to find  him.   The record also shows that between the years 1928 and 1941 several warrants were issued for the arrest of Ang  Gioc, but all attempts to arrest him proved futile because he could not be found.  He was, however, finally arrested on February 18, 1941, nearly thirteen years  from the date fixed for  the reading of the sentence.  He  was subsequently brought before the court and the sentence was read to him, from which he appealed  to the Court of Appeals where,  against  the objection of the Solicitor General, he was allowed to file a bond for his  temporary release.<br><br>In perfecting the record on appeal it was found that the stenographic notes taken during the trial were not transcribed and that the two stenographers who  took the notes were already dead.  The matter was referred  to several stenographers who stated that they could not transcribe the notes because the deceased had used systems  known only to themselves.   In  this situaiton,  Ang Gioc petitioned  the Court of Appeals to remand  the cause to the  court below for a new trial, while the Solicitor General moved for the dismissal of the appeal on the ground that "the present <i>impasse</i> is solely due to accused-appellant having jumped the bail, before the sentence of the court could be  read to him and evaded arrest for thirteen years."  The Court of Appeals decided to remand the cause to the court below for a new trial, stating that from  the affidavits and  other documents  submitted by Ang Gioc  in support of  the petition for bail pending the appeal, it appeared that Ang Gioc was not a fugitive from justice.<br><br>The question presented is whether, upon the facts stated, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to remand the cause to the court of origin for a new  trial.<br><br>In all criminal prosecutions the accused has the right to be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed  of the nature and cause  of the accusation against him,  to have a speedy and public trial, to meet  the witnesses face to face, and to have  compulsory process to  secure the attendance of witnesses in his behalf.   These are among the  rights secured to him by  the  Constitution.   (Constitution, Article III, sec. 1, par. 17.)  He has also the right of appeal; but this is a purely statutory, not a constitutional, right.  (Old Code of Crim. Proc,  sec. 15, par. 8; Rules of Court, Rule 111, sec. 1, par. h.)   All these rights have been recognized and established in order to make sure that justice is done to the accused, and no more.  They were not intended to enable the acused to defeat the very ends of justice.  When, therefore, through cunning or malice, he succeeds in thwarting the course of the law, he should not be heard to complain  if, as a result of his own misconduct, he is deemed to have waived rights which he would  otherwise have enjoyed.  An  accused person must suffer the legitimate consequences of his own  wrongful acts.<br><br>There are certain fundamental rights which cannot be waived even by the accused himself, but the right of appeal is not  one of them.  This right is granted solely  for the benefit of the accused.   He may avail  of  it or not, as he pleases.  He may waive it either expressly or by implication.  When the accused flees after the case has been submitted to  the court for decision, he will be deemed to have waived his  right to  appeal  from the judgment rendered against him. Such was the situation with  reference to the the respondent Ang Gioc.  He was duly notified to appear before the trial court for the reading of the sentence, but failed to do so; and when  an order  was issued for his arrest, the warrant could not be  served  on  him because he could  not  be found.  Whether or not he escaped to China is immaterial for our present purpose.  The fact remains that he succeeded  in  evading  arrest for  nearly  thirteen years.  The record shows  that upon his failure to appear for the reading of the sentence, the trial court declared the confiscation of the bond filed by Ang Gioc,  and later issued the corresponding order of execution.  This action of the court amounted to a judicial declaration that Ang Gioc was a fugitive from justice, and such declaration  cannot after the lapse of nearly thirteen years be controverted by proof <i>aliunde</i>.  A contrary view would encourage accused persons to trifle with the administration of justice, and provide means for guilty parties to escape punishment.  We reject it without the least hesitation by declaring that Ang Gioc had waived his  right to appeal from the  judgment rendered against him.   The law will not allow a person to take advantage of his own wrong.<br><br>Having arrived  at the conclusion  that  Ang Gioc  had waived his right of appeal, the Court of Appeals  acquired no jurisdiction of the appeal filed by him, except to dismiss it and that court  acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it ordered the cause to be remanded to the  court of origin for a  new trial.  It follows that the remanding order must be set aside, and the judgment of the Court of First  Instance of Manila declared final and executory.  So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Diaz, Laurel, Moran</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ.</span>,  concur.</div>
