				<H3>BURGOS T. SAYOC, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT VS. ELLEN CHEN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>

				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff Burgos T. Sayoc, besides being an EENT specialist, is engaged in 
the general practice of medicine. He was formerly with the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines, having attained therein the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel MC.
<p>Defendant Ellen Chen is a duly licensed optometrist having completed both the 
ordinary and the doctorate course in Optometry at the Centro Escolar University. 
According to her evidence, she also had opportunity to study the Japanese 
technique in Optometry and Ophthalmology during her stay in several hospitals 
and universities in Tokyo, particularly the Japanese technique in the operation 
of strabismus, cataract and "double eyelid".</p>
<p>Sometime in the year 1952 plaintiff read a "paper" on "Plastic Construction 
of the Superior Palpebral Fold" at the annual meeting of the Philippine 
Ophthalmological and Otolaryngological Society—hereinafter referred to as 
POOS—for which he received an award of merit. On February 8, 1953 there appeared 
in the Sunday Times Magazine (Exhibit H) an article entitled "Simple Operation 
Widens Slit Eyes" which gave the public the information that plaintiff had 
received an award of merit for "the best scientific paper presented before the 
1952 annual meeting" of the POOS. It also described an operation performed by 
him as "the first of its kind in the world, the plastic operation devised by the 
surgeon."</p>
<p>On February 11, 1953 defendant sent to the POOS the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gentlemen:</p>
<p>Having read with interest the article published in the Sunday Times Magazine 
of February 8, 1953, under the heading 'Simple Operation Widens Slit Eyes', I am 
prompted to bring to your attention certain serious inaccuracies.</p>
<p>The operation referred to is described in German Texts and the procedure 
there described has been availed of by Japanese ophthalmologists for many years. 
Such an operation was performed in Shanghai on the eyes of an acquaintance of 
mine as far back as 1937; similar operations have been performed in Hongkong and 
Formosa for perhaps as long a time.</p>
<p>The operation described by Dr. Sayoc and which merited your award as the 
'best paper of 1952, is not the first of its kind in the world, and as you will 
see from the following is not original with him.</p>
<p>I was in Tokyo in April and May of 1951, also in September and October of 
last year and there observed the method of Japanese ophthalmologists in the 
surgical relief and correction of cataract, strabismus, and other eye 
conditions. Including 'widening of the palpebral, aperture, and the particular 
operation above referred to. My study and observation was intensive. I had 
clinical experience and instruction in their methods by Dr. Yasushi Nakamura, 
Chief, Ophthalmologrcal Department, at the Japan Medical College, Dr. Shikano, 
Chief of the Ophthalmological Department at Imperial University, Dr. Uchida of 
Uschida Ophthalmological Clinic, Dr. Umozawa at Jugen Hospital and Dr. E. Y. 
Takano, Ophthalmologist-in-Chief, at Tokyo Teishin Hospital. Dr. Takano may be 
remembered here as the head of St. Luke's Hospital here in Manila during 1943 
and 1944.</p>
<p>I became acquainted with Dr. Sayoc in 1950 when he began sending patients to 
me for refraction. He became especially interested in what the Japanese 
ophthalmologists refer to as the 'Double Eyelid Operation'. At his request I 
taught him the two methods employed for widening slit eyes and instructed him 
during' his first successful operation of this nature on September 29, 1951, 
employing the technique I brought from the Japanese Ophthalmologists in Tokyo. 
The excellent results of that operation are evidence in the accompanying 
photograph. An equally successful operation was performed in the patient's right 
eye on October 6th, 1951.. The cosmetic effect attained suffers nothing by 
comparison with the illustration in the magazine article.</p>
<p>The magazine article illustrations of stages in the operation bear a striking 
similarity to my notes and instructions as received in Tokyo, a portion of which 
appear in the accompanying photostat. Dr. Sayoc may have worked for six years on 
the stages and mechanism of the operation but when I instructed him in 1951 he 
appeared to me to be totally unacquainted with the procedure.</p>
<p align="right">Very truly yours,</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) Ellen Chen, O.D."</p></blockquote>
<p>Defendant furnished copies of the above letter to the Sunday Times Magazine, 
Dr. Jesus Eusebio, Dr. Domingo Antonio, Dr. Felisa Fernando, Dr. Geminiano de 
Ocampo and Dr. H. del Castillo. The physicians just named, all residents of the 
City of Manila, were members of the POOS, except Drs. Antonio and del 
Castillo.</p>
<p>On April 25, 1953, claiming that the following portion of the letter above 
reproduced—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I became acquainted with Dr. Sayoc in 1950 when he began sending patients to 
me for refraction. He became especially interested in what the Japanese 
ophthalmologists refer to as the 'double eyelid operation'. At his request I 
taught him the two methods employed for widening slit eyes and instructed him 
during his first successful operation of this nature on September 29, 1951, 
employing the technique I brought from the Japanese Ophthalmologists in 
Tokyo.*** Dr. Sayoc may have worked for six years on the stages and mechanism of 
the operation but when I instructed him in 1951 he appeared to me to be totally 
unacquainted with the procedure.* * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>contained false and libelous statements, had wounded his feelings, besmirched 
and injured his reputation and good name, exposed him to ridicule and contempt, 
etc, plaintiff commenced the present action to recover from defendant P50.000.00 
as moral damages and P5,000.00 as attorney's fees.</p>
<p>Answering the complaint defendant alleged, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 
plastic constructions on the upper eyelid mentioned in plaintiff's "paper" were 
not original of plaintiff nor were the first in the world, as published in the 
Sunday Times Magazine of February 8, 1953; that she taught plaintiff the formula 
on the double eyelid operation after her trip and observation in Japan; that her 
letter of February 11, 1953 was a privileged communication and was intended to 
reveal the whole truth in good faith and with justifiable motive; that because 
of the formula that plaintiff learned from her and the modified and improved 
newspaper advertisement of plaintiff's operations which, by agreement, was taken 
care of by defendant, the former acquired numerous patients and made several 
successful operations on double eyelid; that, according to agreement, plaintiff 
paid her 40% of the professional fees paid by the first patients, but 
subsequently refused to continue doing so, but instead caused to be published an 
open letter in the Manila Chronicle of April 29, 1953, sent libelous 
communications to the POOS on February 19 of the same year and to the President 
of the Optometric Association on February 25, 1953, causing her to suffer actual 
damages in the sum of P25,000.00 and moral damages in another sum of 
P25,000.00.</p>
<p>The alleged defamatory matter contained in plaintiff's open letter published 
in the Manila Chronicle of April 29, 1953 reads partly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Par. 3) 'Dr. Ellen Chen, a Chinese lady is an optometrist, who refracts and 
dispenses eye glasses. * * * Her claim to have introduced the 'Simple Operation 
Widens Slit Eyes' is beyond comprehension because she is not a doctor of 
medicine but an optometrist'"</p>
<p>"(Par. 4) 'For the information of the reading public 'Dr.' Ellen Chen who has 
slit eyes is one of the patients of Dr. Sayoc'"</p></blockquote>
<p>The alleged defamatory matter contained in the letter sent by plaintiff to 
the POOS on February 19, 1953 reads partly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Par. 5) 'I met Miss E. Chen again sometime in October, 1950, after I had 
arrived from States. She even started referring patients again to me. One 
afternoon, she came inquiring if I could enlarge slit eyes for she has them 
herself. I replied that while in States I was trying to look for a certain 
technique to that effect, but that it was not known in the United States and 
that I had my own. She appeared very much interested with my operation and then 
she remarked that if I had any case, I could send for her if I wanted to, so she 
could even interpret for me if the patients were Chinese. In one or two 
patients, Miss Chen was able to see the operation at my clinic. At one time she 
even volunteered to help me in spite of my assistants, my son, a medical 
student, and my wife, a dentist. After sensing that I can have many patients 
among the Chinese, she made a dubious proposition for every Chinese patient who 
submits to that kind of operation, she wanted 40% of the fees; she proposed even 
that a contract be drawn to such effect.***"</p>
<p>"(Par. 6) '*** Again she mentioned that dubious proposition of 40% to which I 
remarked that I did not like to have anything to do with her on that matter'" 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The alleged defamatory matter contained in plaintiff's letter to the 
President of the Optometric Association, of February 25, 1953, reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(Par. 6) 'In that connection, I am prompted to send you this letter and 
enclosures complaining against her unethical conduct which is a disgrace to your 
profession if she is a member. * * *'"</p></blockquote>
<p>In answer to defendants counterclaim plaintiff admitted having sent the 
letters mentioned above but denied that the same contained any libelous or 
malicious statements.</p>
<p>After trial upon the issue thus joined, the lower court rendered judgment 
absolving defendant from plaintiff's complaint and likewise absolving plaintiff 
from, defendant's counterclaim, without pronouncement as to costs. From said 
judgment both parties appealed.</p>
<p>The questions raised by both parties in this instance are, more or less, 
similar.</p>
<p>The first assignment of error submitted in plaintiff's brief assails the 
lower court's ruling to the effect that defendant's letter marked as Exhibit K-l 
is a privileged communication; the second, third, sixth to the ninth 
assignments-of error cover the proposition that said court erred in not 
declaring that said letter is, in part, libelous. and actionable, and in not 
finding that plaintiff was entitled to moral damages and attorney's fees, while 
the fourth and fifth assignments of error are to the effect that said court also 
erred in holding that plaintiff's letter Exhibit 13 is sufficient proof that he 
had sent patients to defendant for refraction, and in giving weight, in this 
connection, to the suspicions receipt Exhibit 5-a.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, in her first assignment of error defendant assails the 
ruling of the lower court to the effect that plaintiff's open letter to the 
Manila Chronicle, and his letter to Dr. Estrada, Exhibits 6 and 7, respectively, 
are not libelous, while in the second she claims that said court erred in 
dismissing her counterclaim.</p>
<p>We agree with plaintiff that defendant's letter Exhibit K-l, particularly the 
portion marked as Exhibit K-2, is not privileged. On the assumption that, 
originally, it, was privileged, it ceased to be so from, the moment defendant 
sent copies thereof to parties 'who had no authority of any kind over plaintiff, 
but to the contrary, were, we might say, his competitors in the practice of 
medicine—particularly in the line of his specialty. </p>
<p>After reading the letter in question, however, we are constrained to hold 
that the same is not libelous and cannot give rise to liability for damages on 
the part of its author. The contents, thereof, it must be admitted, cannot be 
pleasing to the plaintiff nor could they positively enhance his reputation as a 
professional, but it does not indulge in personalities, nor does it follow the 
plaintiff into his private life. Its main purpose—it would seem—is to correct 
certain inaccuracies that its author had discovered in the article regarding the 
work of plaintiff. A communication of its kind should not be subjected to 
microscopic examination to discover grounds of malice, bad faith or falsity.</p>
<p>A reading of the letter in question makes it clear that it does not charge 
the plaintiff with any crime, vice or defect. It states clearly that the 
writer's only purpose is to invite attention to certain inaccuracies contained 
in the article published in the Sunday Times Magazine, and if, aside from 
sending the letter to said publication, she likewise sent copies thereof to 
other members of the medical profession, it was because their names appeared 
mentioned in said articles and defendant thought it her moral duty to them and 
to society in general to invite their attention to what she believed glaring 
inaccuracies in the article.</p>
<p>Whether the plaintiff was the originator of the double eyelid operation or 
not, whether the technique' required for the success of an operation of that 
kind was learned in Japan by defendant and she later taught such technique or 
'its formula to the plaintiff was the subject of conflicting evidence—that for 
one side not being clearly preponderant over that of the other. But even 
assuming that defendant's statements and views on this matter were incorrect, 
there is no sufficient evidence that in sending the letter in question for 
publication in the Sunday Times Magazine she had acted with utter malice and not 
merely for the purpose of placing the true facts before the general public. 
Furthermore, even assuming that, as plaintiff contends, the publication of said 
letter subjected him to embarrassing questions from his colleagues in the 
profession and prevented his promotion from "active" member to "fellow" member 
of the POOS, we agree with the trial court that there is no sufficient evidence 
in the record to establish the pecuniary value of the embarrassment allegedly 
suffered by the plaintiff and of the promotion he claims to have failed to 
secure.'</p>
<p>On the question of whether the letter under consideration contained falsities 
with respect to the main matter involved, it appears that the plaintiff himself 
doea not claim originality for the operation described in his "paper"—according 
to the letter of Dr. Jesus Eusebio, marked Exhibit 10. That it was described in 
the article as "the first of its kind in the world, etc." was therefore the view 
of the writer of the article and not the claim of the plaintiff. Defendant was 
therefore entitled to correct such inaccuracy and to invite the attention of the 
POOS and other competent persons to the same.</p>
<p>Coming now to defendant's appeal, we agree with the trial court that the open 
letter published by plaintiff in the Manila Chronicle and his letters to the 
POOS and the President of the Optometric Association are not libelous nor 
malicious. The last may be considered a privileged communication because it was 
addressed' to the President of the Optometric Association which undoubtedly had 
interest in the, proper conduct to be observed by optometrists. The mere fact 
that the abbreviation Dr. was enclosed within quotation marks did net make the 
letter aforesaid libelous or defamatory. As the lower court held, this should be 
taken only as an indication of poor taste.</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding the judgment appealed from to be in accordance with law 
and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
