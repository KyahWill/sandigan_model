				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA  ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On August 5,  1957,  two informations were filed before the  Court  of First Instance of Pasay  City  accusing  defendant Rosario B. de  Leon  of  violating (1)  Circular  37, as implemented by Circular  60,  Section 1(6)  of  the Central Bank, in relation  to  Section 34 of  Republic Act No. 265  (Criminal Case  No.  4100-P), and  (2)  Circular  No. 42, Section  3 (a), as amended  by  Circular No. 55 of the Central Bank,  in relation  to Section  34 of the  same  Act (Criminal Case No.  4101-P).</p>
<p>Accused  having pleaded not guilty to the  charges, the two cases were tried jointly in  the course of which the following facts were established: Rosario B. de Leon was a booked outgoing passenger on  the Philippine Air Lines Plane No. P1-770 scheduled to leave for Hongkong from the Manila  International  Airport,  Pasay  City,  at 12:30 p.m. on August 3, 1957.  After the inspection of her luggage by the customs authorities  and the declaration by De  Leon at the Central Bank counter of the money she had in  her  possession, she repaired to the area reserved for departing passengers.  While there, however, she was accosted by agent Socorro de Guzman who asked her how much money she was carrying to which De Leon answered that she had P100.00 only.  De Guzman  examined  her handbag and found the P100.00 which she had declared. Then De Guzman examined De Leon's passport wallet and found behind its cover the sum of P700.00 and one $100.00 bill.  De Guzman again inquired from the accused  if that was all the money she had and receiving  an affirmative reply  the former  invited the latter to the ladies'  room for further inspection during which De Guzman found P700.00 sewed  at the bottom  of De Leon's  panties and Plf000.00 in each of her breast paddings.  De Guzman  thereafter took De Leon to agent Beleno who also  investigated her and it was then that De Leon  made a voluntary statement admitting that agent De  Guzman  had seized  from  her person  the  articles and amounts  above  referred  to.  It was also proven that De Leon failed to secure  the necessary permit from the Central Bank to carry the excess money found in her possession.</p>
<p>After the prosecution had  presented its  evidence, defendant filed a motion to dismiss manifesting that if same is denied the cases would be  deemed submitted  for  decision.   Subsequently, the trial court  denied the motion and rendered decision on  February 27,  1958 finding De Leon guilty in both cases as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1) In Criminal  Case No. 4100-P the  accused Rosario  B. de Leon is hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment for three (3) months, pay a fine of Three Thousand (f 3,000.00)  Pesos, with subsidiary imprisonment in  case  of  insolvency and to pay the  costs.  The twenty pieces of one hundred-peso bills, exhibits  'F', 'F-l', to 'F-19', inclusive, and the twenty-eight pieces of fifty-peso bills,  exhibits 'F-20' to 'F-47',  inclusive, are hereby declared  forfeited in  favor of the government; and,</p>
  <p>"(2)  In Criminal  Case  No. 4101-P the  accused Rosario  B. de Leon  is hereby sentenced to  suffer  imprisonment  for  three (3) months, pay  a fine of Three  Hundred (P300.00) Pesos, with subsidiary imprisonment in case  of insolvency  and to pay the  costs. The one hundred dollar bill  (exhibit  'E')  is hereby declared forfeited in  favor of the government."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defendant  is  now appealing from  the  above decision contending  that the  trial court  erred in not acquitting her on the following grounds:  (1) that Circular No. 42, being merely an  implementation  of Circular No. 20 which was issued without the approval of the President of  the  Philippines and contains no provision limiting the period of its operation or enforcement,  is null and  void; (2) that Circulars Nos. 20 and 42, as amended, contravene the Articles of Agreement  of  the  International   Monetary   Fund  to which the Philippines is a signatory;  (3) that the afore-mentioned  circulars  were  issued  without  the approval of the President of the United States pursuant to  the agreement entered into between that  country  and the  Philippines concerning trade and related matters;  (4)  that the issuance of Circulars Nos. 42 and 37,  as  amended,  cannot be legally based on Sections 74 and 14 of Republic Act No. 265; and  (5) since the information filed in Criminal  Case No. 4100-P does not allege that the accused did not  have the requisite license  to carry the  money found in her possession, the same fails to state facts sufficient to constitute the crime charged.</p>
<p>The issues raised by appellant are not new.   They  have already been passed upon by this Court  in a number of cases wherein this Court held that Circular No. 20, which was implemented by Circular No.  42, was  in fact approved by the President of the Philippines and that, having been issued to  combat the exchange  crisis  that  developed  in this country, its period of operation need not be expressly stated but that it is deemed co-extensive with the duration of  such crisis which up  to the present still exists<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>.  And with  regard  to the  contention that  the  above circulars contravene the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund and were  passed without the approval  of the President of the  United  States, this  Court in People <em>vs</em>. Koh, <em>supra</em>, said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"As  to  the  international aspect,  it is not incumbent upon  the prosecution to prove that the provisions of Circular  20  complied with all pertinent international agreements binding on  our Government.  The Central Bank and  the President certify that it accords therewith, and it is presumed that said officials knew whereof they spoke, and that they performed their duties properly.  It is rather for the defense to show conflict, if  any, between the Circular and our international commitments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Appellees' counsel have quoted  here some provisions of the  International Monetary Fund Agreement.  But none of them  may l&gt;e interpreted to prohibit the action  taken by  our  Central Bank.  In fact, there are  of record, the  annual reports of the International Monetary Fund of April 30, 1950 and  1951, commenting on the exchange controls of the Philippines without  criticism or opposition. "We are quoted in  this connection the following provision in the Agreement between the  Philippines and the  United States  concerning  Trade and Related  Matters:</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"But  there is  an official  statement of the American Embassy in Manila  wherein it is said that the United States 'would concur' in the adoption of  such temporary measures  (exchange  controls)  by the Philippine  Government  as  might  be deemed appropriate for safeguarding the  dollar reserves  of the  Philippines.  From the tenor  of the statement, one could conclude that the U.S. Government  did not object  to, even  approved the imposition of dollar exchange restrictions."  (<em>See also</em> People <em>vs</em>. Lim Ho, <em>supra</em>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anent the fourth issue posed by appellant, it is likewise unquestionable that Circulars Nos.  42 and 37, as amended, were legally promulgated by the Monetary Board in  the exercise  of its  power under the law, this Court having ruled that Circular No.  42,  as amended,  was issued by virtue of the authority granted by Section 74 of Republic Act No.  265 (People <em>vs</em>. Lim Ho, svtpra), while Circular No. 37, as amended, by Section 14, in relation to Sections 2  and 64  of the  same  Act  (People <em>vs</em>.  Exconde, 100 Phil.,  1125), the  same  having  been issued  with the primordial purpose of conserving our  dwindling  dollar reserve and preserving the international value of our peso. We find, however, merit in the fifth issue, it appearing that the information filed in  Criminal Case  No.  4100-P fails to state that the accused did  not have the  necessary license to carry the money that was seized  in her possession,  and hence the same is fatally  defective.  As this Court aptly said in People <em>vs</em>. Capistrano, 102 Phil.,  1025; 54 Off. Gaz. (11) 3499, "in order that the pertinent portion of the circular may be infringed, it is necessary to  allege that the outgoing Philippine resident or transient visitor has taken or is about to take  out of the Philippines Philippine coins and notes in excess of the exempted  amount  <em>without the necessary license issued by the Central Bank.</em> An examination of  the information does not show any  averment of  this  element. <em>This  omission makes the  charge alleged  in the  information  insufficient to  constitute  an offense for which appellant may be convicted and rendered amenable  for the  penalty prescribed by  law."</em>   (Italics supplied.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, with  the modification that the information filed in Criminal Case No. 4100-P (G. R.  No. L-13567) should be  dismissed without prejudice,  the rest  of the decision is hereby  affirmed,  with costs against appellant.</p>
