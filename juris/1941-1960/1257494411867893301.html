				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FELIPE C. CRUZ, ACCUSED. GLOBE ASSURANCE CO., INC., BONDSMAN AND APPELLANT.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Felipe C. Cruz was charged with estafa in two separate cases before the 
Justice of the Peace Court of Lucena, Quezon. To secure his provisional liberty, 
he was allowed to put up a personal bail bond in the amount of P7,000.00 which 
was subscribed in the two cases by the Globe Assurance Co., Inc. Thereafter, the 
cases were forwarded to the Court of First Instance of Quezon where the accused 
was formally indicted charging him with the same crime of estafa to which he 
pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>On June 25, 1955, a copy of the notice of hearing was sent to the bondsman 
which was served thru the Sheriff of the City of Manila by leaving it with a 
person with sufficient discretion to receive it. When the date of hearing came, 
the accused failed to appear, whereupon the court ordered the,forfeiture of the 
bond giving the bondsman 30 days within which to produce the accused and to show 
cause why judgment should not be rendered against it for the amount of its bond. 
On July 21, 1955, the accused himself filed a motion for reconsideration 
attaching thereto an affidavit of merit.</p>
<p>Because the bondsman failed to comply with the court's order dated July 
18,1955, the trial court rendered judgment against it for the amount of its 
bond, while ordering the arrest of the accused unless he files a new bail bond. 
Thereupon, upon receipt of said order, the accused filed on October 23, 1956 a 
new bond thru the Alliance Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. for the same amount of 
P7,000.00, which was duly approved, resulting in the abatement of the order for 
his arrest.</p>
<p>On June 17, 1957, the Globe Assurance Co., Inc., the original bondsman, filed 
a motion praying that the accused be required to file a new bail bond in order 
that its own bond may be cancelled, which motion the court denied considering 
that said bond has already been declared forfeited in view of its failure to 
produce the accused on the date of hearing. The bondsman filed a motion for 
reconsideration, which the court also denied on the ground that the order 
forfeiting the bond has already beeome final and executory. The bondsman filed a 
second motion for reconsideration, which the court likewise denied, although it 
stated that if it could produce the accused within sixty days the court might 
look with favor its petition for relief, whereupon the bondsman interposed the 
present appeal.</p>
<p>Under the rules of this Court, when the appearance of an accused is required, 
his sureties shall be notified to produce him before the court on a given date. 
If the accused fails to appear as required, the bond is declared forfeited and 
the bondsmen are given 30 days within which to produce the accused and to show 
cause why judgment should not be rendered against them for the amount of the 
bond. Within the said period of 30 days the bondsmen (a) must produce the body 
of the accused, or give their reasons for his non-production; and (b) must 
explain satisfactorily why the accused did not appear when first required so to 
do. If they fail to comply with these requisites, the court shall render 
judgment against them on the bond (Section 15, Rule 110, Rules of Court).</p>
<p>In the instant cases, the lower court issued a notice setting their hearing 
on July 15, 1955, copy of which was sent to bondsman-appellant thru the Sheriff 
of Manila who made the corresponding return on the back thereof to the effect 
that he has served the same by leaving a copy with a person authorized to 
receive it. When said date came, the accused failed to appear and so the court 
declared the bond forfeited and g$ve the bondsman 30 days within which to 
produce the accused and to show cause why judgment should not be rendered 
against it for the amount of the bond. And since the bondsman-appellant failed 
to either produce the accused or give a satisfactory explanation of its failure 
within the period set for doing so, the lower court rendered judgment against it 
for the amount of the bond. The lower court, therefore, did nothing but to 
comply with the rules relative to the bond filed by appellant.</p>
<p>But it is contended that <em>three days</em> after the confiscation of the 
bond was ordered by the trial court, the accused on his own accord filed a 
motion for reconsideration praying for the lifting of the order for the reasons 
stated in his affidavit of merit, which motion the court should have entertained 
not only because it was seasonably filed but because the reasons alleged for his 
failure appear to be satisfactory. While these reasons may be satisfactory with 
regard to the order of arrest, which in effect were so found by the trial court 
when it ordered the release of the accused on condition that he files a new bail 
bond, they were not satisfactory insofar as the appellant is concerned, it 
appearing that it utterly failed to explain its failure to produce the accused 
sb required by the court. What appellant did was to file a motion for the 
cancellation of its own bond, which the lower court properly denied, considering 
that the order forfeiting the bond had become final long ago.</p>
<p>It is true that the bondsman now claims that it failed to respond to the 
order of July 18, 1955 because it never received a copy thereof which jnade it 
impossible for it to implement it, but this is hard to believe considering the 
time that has elapsed since its issuance to the date it filed its motion for 
cancellation. To this effect, we find satisfactory the following comment of the 
Solicitor General:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The facts as shown by the records however, furnish adequate support to 
warrant the application of the presumption of law to the effect that said orders 
were duly received by appellant-bondsman. No convincing explanation has been 
adduced to prove a conclusion to the contrary. In fact, several notices of 
hearing have reached bondsman-appellant, and it is rather difficult to believe* 
that the abovementioned orders of the court were the only ones not received by 
appellant. Indeed, th"e almost two years that had lapsed from the time the last 
order was issued until the motion for substitution and cancellation of bond was 
filed, is quite considerably long enough to have made appellant discover the 
status of the case as part of their business operation, especially so in the 
face of an assertion by appellant in its motion for reconsideration fehat 'even 
as early as September, 1954,. the accused already moved his residence! without 
even notifying the bondsman so that the notice sent by us as early as September, 
1954 returned unclaimed' and 'since then, all notices vsent to the accused 
returned unclaimed.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>However, considering the fact that <em>three days</em> after the forfeiture 
of appellant's bond the accused immediately submitted to the jurisdiction of the 
court giving weighty reasons for his failure to appear, we agree with the 
Solicitor General that the amount adjudged against appellant may be reduced to a 
degree this Court may deem reasonable, following the policy enunciated in 
several similar cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> especially that 
of People vs. Puyal, 98 Phil., 415; 52 Off. Gaz. (16) 6886.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of the trial court dated September 12, 1955 is hereby 
modified in the sense of reducing the amount adjudged against appellant to 
P2,000.00. No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order modified.</em>
