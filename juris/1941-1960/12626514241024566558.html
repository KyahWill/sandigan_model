				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; for <i>habeas corpus</i>. <br><br>Petitioner, an American citizen who had been&nbsp; residing in the Philippines since his&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; from&nbsp; the United States Navy in&nbsp; 1946, was&nbsp; on February 10, 1955&nbsp; issued an alien certificate&nbsp; of registration&nbsp; which&nbsp; he,&nbsp; however, surrendered on that&nbsp; same day&nbsp; upon issuance to him&nbsp; of an emigration clearance certificate for a short visit abroad and a re-entry permit that was good up to May 10,&nbsp; 1955. On February 15 of that same year he left for abroad, but he returned two months later, armed with a non-immigrant passport visa on the&nbsp; strength&nbsp; of&nbsp; which he&nbsp; was allowed to land and stay here as a "temporary visitor" for a period not exceeding&nbsp; two weeks.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the&nbsp; expiration of that period, he&nbsp; was notified by the immigration authorities&nbsp; to leave the country&nbsp; not later&nbsp; than&nbsp; July 12, 1955&nbsp; or else face deportation proceedings.&nbsp; And as&nbsp; he chose to remain. notwithstanding the expiration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; period of grace,&nbsp; he was ordered arrested by the Commissioner of Immigration on charge of having violated the limitation of his stay here. Following&nbsp; his&nbsp; arrest, he was,&nbsp; with&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; of counsel, formally investigated&nbsp; by&nbsp; a board of special inquiry, and upon the investigation being concluded, that board submitted its&nbsp; findings and recommendation to the Board&nbsp; of Commissioners as provided by&nbsp; law. <br><br>Before the Board of Commissioners could&nbsp; render&nbsp; its decision, the petitioner applied in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila for a&nbsp; writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas&nbsp; corpus</span> alleging that he had been illegally arrested and was being detained despite presentation of his re-entry permit&nbsp; prior to the date of its expiry. <br><br>The petition was opposed by the respondent Commissioner of Immigration.&nbsp; But after&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by the lower&nbsp; court on the grounds that, having already surrendered his&nbsp; re-entry&nbsp; permit&nbsp; and given&nbsp; back his&nbsp; alien certificate&nbsp; of registration—which&nbsp; entitles&nbsp; him to&nbsp; reside here permanently—petitioner had a right to remain. <br><br>From this decision the&nbsp; respondent immediately appealed to this&nbsp; Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; But despite perfection&nbsp; of the appeal, the lower court ordered petitioner's release on bail. <br><br>The appellant has raised various questions, among them that of&nbsp; the&nbsp; propriety of the&nbsp; court's&nbsp; receiving&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; not presented to the board&nbsp; of special inquiry, the evidence consisting&nbsp; of petitioner's testimony to the effect that the reason&nbsp; why he sought re-entry on&nbsp; a transit&nbsp; visa was because, while in Singapore,&nbsp; he received&nbsp; a message from his wife in Manila, asking him to pick her up for she also wanted to&nbsp; go abroad, and the Philippine consul&nbsp; in that city,&nbsp; upon being consulted on the matter, advised him to obtain a transit visa; but that, finding his wife sick upon his arrival&nbsp; here, he&nbsp; decided to remain&nbsp; and surrendered his re-entry permit. <br><br>Without need of going, into all the questions raised, we think the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for <i>habeas corpus</i> must be&nbsp; denied&nbsp; as premature, the same having been&nbsp; filed&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Immigration, the agency primarily&nbsp; entrusted with the final&nbsp; determination of petitioner's right to stay permanently&nbsp; in the Philippines, has rendered its decision. <br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of exceptional&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus </span>proceeding&nbsp; to&nbsp; prevent deportation&nbsp; is&nbsp; premature&nbsp; if&nbsp; proceedings are&nbsp; still&nbsp; pending before the Commissioner of Immigration."&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. ex rel. Loucas vs. Commissioner&nbsp; of Immigration, D.C.N.Y., 49&nbsp; F. 2nd. 473, cited in 39 C.J.S.&nbsp; p. 528)</blockquote> No exceptional circumstances&nbsp; have&nbsp; been shown to take this case out of the general&nbsp; rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not even claimed, and indeed&nbsp; it does not appear,&nbsp; that the Board has been unduly&nbsp; delaying its decision.&nbsp; There is, therefore,&nbsp; in our opinion no justification for judicial interference. <br><blockquote>"Unless it is shown that the&nbsp; deportee is being indefinitely imprisoned&nbsp; under the pretense of awaiting a&nbsp; chance for deportation or unless the Government admits that&nbsp; it can not&nbsp; deport him or <i>unless the detainee is being held for too long a period</i> our courts will not interfere.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *'."&nbsp; (Borovsky vs. Commissioner of Immigration and&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of Prisons,&nbsp; 84 Phi]., 151.)&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</blockquote> Wherefore, the decision appealed from is set aside and petitioner&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; recommitted&nbsp; to&nbsp; respondent's custody. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.
