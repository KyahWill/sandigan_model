				<H3>HOSPICIO A. PACAL, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE F. RAMOS, JUDGE OF THE FIRST INSTANCE OF MINDORO, AND AGATON N. COSUCO, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondent Agaton N. Cosuco was proclaimed mayor-elect of Mamburao, Mindoro 
in the elections of November 11, 1947, with 539 votes 'against 524 votes 
received by Hospicio A. Pacal.
<p>In a motion of protest, dated November 20, 1947, Pacal contested Cosuco's 
election upon two sets of grounds: 1. That protestee'is ineligible because 
(<em>a</em>) he is not a Filipino citizen, (<em>b</em>) he has not filed his 
certificate of Candidacy within the time prescribed by law, and (<em>c</em>) he 
spent for his campaign more than the total amount of the emoluments for one year 
attached to the office of mayor of Mamburao, and 2. That errors, irregularities, 
illegalities and frauds had been committed in precinct Nos. 3, 4 and 5 without 
which protestant would have won with a plurality not less than 100 votes. Among 
other remedies, protestant prayed that protestee be declared disqualified to 
hold the office of mayor or that his election be annulled and, in any case, that 
protestant be declared elected to the office.</p>
<p>In his answer, dated December 2, 1947, protestee, among others, made the 
allegation that the set of grounds for the protest about alleged ineligibility 
of the contestee should be stricken out from the protest upon the authority of 
section 173 of the Election Code, and averred facts belying the three grounds of 
ineligibility. At the same time, contestee denied all protestant's allegations 
about election irregularities and frauds in precinct Nos. 3, 4 and 5, and 
countered with the allegation that if any irregularity, fraud or anomaly was 
made in said precincts, the same was committed by and for the contestant and, as 
a matter of fact, pointed to specific frauds, irregularities and errors which, 
if, proved, would give him a greater majority. </p>
<p>On January 21, 1948, contestee filed agnation to dismiss the case upon the 
theory that the action taken by protestant, by impugning protestee's 
eligibility, is in the nature of a <em>quo warranto</em> proceedings which, 
having been started on November 24, 1947, ten days after contestee's 
proclamation which took place on November 14, violates the provision of section 
173 of the Election Code, according to which the petition for <em>quo 
warranto</em> should be filed within one week after the proclamation. The 
protestee added that if the proceedings can be considered as a joint <em>quo 
warranto</em> and election contest, the court's jurisdiction cannot be exercised 
jointly on both proceedings. </p>
<p>Protestant answered the motion to dismiss, alleging that the proceedings he 
initiated is in the nature of an election contest with separate and alternate 
grounds. At the same time, considering that May 24, 1948, is the deadline for 
the decision of the case, protestant, acceding to protestee' s suggestion made 
in his answer, moved that his allegations about protestee's ineligibility be 
ordered stricken out, excepting the one regarding expenses in the election.</p>
<p>On April 19, 1948, respondent judge ordered the dismissal of the case finding 
that the protest "contains sufficient allegations constituting an action for an 
election contest" and, at the same time, "substantially all the allegations 
necessary to sustain an action for <em>quo warranto</em>," and that, under the 
rule laid down in Rama <em>vs</em>. Yonzon, 52 Phil., 446, 447, the lover court 
cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the two remedies jointly and in the same 
proceedings, adding that "since the petition cannot now be amended in order 
either to separate the two remedies erroneously merged or eliminate one of them, 
because such an amendment would be out of time, there remains no alternative but 
to dismiss the case." </p>
<p>Respondent judge erred in dismissing the protest. The rounds for <em>quo 
warranto</em> are separable from the grounds for election irregularities alleged 
in the protest. In fact, they are alleged in separate paragraphs. There is no 
provision of law, authority, or principle of justice against their separation. 
Contestee himself suggested in his answer that the grounds for <em>quo 
warranto</em> should be "stricken out from the protest," and protestant followed 
the suggestion by moving for the elimination of the disputed allegations, There 
is no valid reason why respondent judge could not accede to the course of action 
proposed by both parties. When two independent actions are improperly joined in 
one proceeding, it is the duty of the court to order their separation, so that 
each one may proceed independently of the other. If one of them should be 
dismissed on jurisdictional or other legal ground, its dismissal should not 
affect the other action if there is no legal ground to dismiss it. Each action 
should be dealt with according to its own merits. </p>
<p>As prayed for, the order of April. 19, 1948, is set aside and respondent 
judge is ordered to proceed without delay to try and decide on the Merits of the 
election protest filed by petitioner Hospicio A. Pacal versus. Agaton N. Cosuco 
without costs. By its urgent nature, this decision shall executory immediately 
upon its promulgation.</p><em>Par√°s, Actg. C.J., Feria,</em> and <em>Tuason, 
JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
