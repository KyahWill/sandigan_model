				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from two orders of the Court of First Instance of 
Pangasinan in Civil Case No. 12316, the first dismissing plaintiffs' complaint, 
and the second denying plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and for the 
admission of an amended complaint.
<p>On October 16, 1952, plaintiffs Eriberto P. Rosario and Paz Untalan de 
Rosario filed a complaint against defendants Filomeno Carangdang, et al., 
specifically alleging therein that plaintiffs-appellants are the owners and 
possessors of a parcel of land (lot No. 2, plan Psu-123111) in Labrador, 
Pangasinan; that they have applied for the registration thereof in Registration 
Case No. 658, G.L.R.O. No. 2610, wherein defendants filed an opposition; that on 
or about October 3, 1952, defendants illegally entered into the premises, 
destroyed the nipa plants thereon, and made dikes to convert the place into a 
fishpond; that in spite of warnings and notices from plaintiffs-appellants, 
defendants continued to possess and occupy the premises; and that as a result of 
defendants' entry into and possession of the land in question, plaintiffs have 
suffered damages in the amount of P2,000.</p>
<p>On November 3, 1952, defendants moved for the dismissal of the complaint, 
claiming (1) that the Court had no jurisdiction of the case because it is one of 
forcible entry and detainer exclusively cognizable by the Justice of the Peace 
Court, and furthermore, because the demand for damages does not exceed P2,000; 
and (2) that there is another action pending between the same parties and for 
the same cause (Land Registration Case No. 658, G.L.R.O. No. 2610, wherein 
plaintiffs are the applicants and defendants are the oppositors, and Land 
Registration Case No. 602, G.L.R.O. No. 2313, wherein defendants are the 
applicants and plaintiffs are the oppositors) in which the title and ownership 
of the parcel in question is involved and contested. Plaintiffs opposed the 
motion to dismiss, alleging that the Court of First Instance acting as a 
registration court, can not award damages resulting from defendants' alleged 
illegal entry into and possession of the land in question.</p>
<p>The lower Court found the motion to dismiss meritorious, and on November 7, 
1952 ordered the dismissal of the complaint. Plaintiffs moved for the 
reconsideration of the order of dismissal, and prayed as well for the admission 
of an amended complaint, wherein they make specific allegation for the first 
time that the defendants are claiming ownership of the land in question in the 
two registration cases previously mentioned. Defendants opposed the motion for 
reconsideration and the admission of an amended complaint, upon the ground that 
the amended complaint would convert plaintiffs' action from one of forcible 
entry and detainer to one of recovery of ownership and possession. Again, 
defendants' position was sustained by the Court below; and later, it denied a 
motion for the reconsideration of the order of dismissal. Hence, this appeal by 
the plaintiffs to this Court.</p>
<p>We see no error in the lower Court's dismissal of appellants' original 
complaints. It was filed on October 16, 1952, barely two weeks from and after 
the alleged entry into and illegal taking of possession of the land in question 
by the defendants. The case pleaded was a clear action for forcible entry and 
detainer, where plaintiffs allege prior possession of the premises in question 
and to have been deprived thereof within the period of one year, by other person 
or persons, who excluded them therefrom and withheld possession without rightâ€”a 
case falling within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the justice of 
the peace courts (Rule 72, Sec. 1, Rules of Court: Sec. 88, Rep. Act 296).</p>
<p>Appellants insist that their action is not for forcible entry and detainer 
but for declaration of ownership or quieting of title, with claim for damages in 
the sum of P2,500 This argument is untenable. There is no averment in the 
complaint that the defendants claim or dispute the ownership of the parcel in 
question. The simple allegation therein that defendants have filed an opposition 
in the case where plaintiffs have applied for the registration of said parcel, 
does not amount to an allegation that the defendants are claiming ownership 
thereof, since an opposition in a registration case may be based on claims or 
interest other than ownership in the land sought to be registered. And neither 
does the fact that appellants pray in their complaint that they be declared 
owners of the parcel in question convert their action from one of forcible entry 
into one for declaration of ownership or quieting of title; for the prayer is 
not a material part of the complaint (Vda. de Lacson <em>vs</em>. Diaz, 87 
Phil., 150, 47 Off. Gaz., [Supp.] 337), arid it is the allegations of the 
complaint, and not the prayer,, that not only determine the jurisdiction of the 
court, but confer that jurisdiction (Fernandez contra Gala-Sison, 
<em>supra</em>, p. 282; Infante <em>vs</em>. Dulay, 67 Phil., 259). </p>
<p>Plaintiffs also insist that their action falls within the jurisdiction of the 
Court of First Instance, because their claim for damages amounts to P2,500. This 
argument is untenable. In the first place, settled is the rule that justice of 
the peace courts have exclusive jurisdiction over forcible entry and detainer 
cases, regardless of the amount claimed therein as damages (Lao Seng Hian, et 
al. <em>vs</em>. Honorable Natividad Almeda Lopez, et al., 83 Phil., 617; 46 
Off. Gaz., [11] 70). In the second place, it appears from the allegations of the 
complaint that only the amount of P2,000 is claimed to have been suffered by 
appellants as damages as a result of defendants' illegal possession and 
destruction of the land in question (par. 8 of the complaint, Rec. on App., p. 
4), the additional claim of P500 being allegedly for "additional expenses, 
besides the damages stated above", meaning expenses incurred due to the filing 
of this case. Considering that the expenses for the filing of the suit, viz, 
costs and attorneys' fees, are excluded from the jurisdictional amount that 
confer jurisdiction upon courts, the additional amount of P500 claimed by 
appellants in their complaint would not take their case out of the jurisdiction 
of the justice of the peace court, even if such jurisdiction were to be 
determined by no other factor than the amount sought to be recovered in the 
complaint.</p>
<p>Under their second assignment of error, appellants contend that the lower 
Court erred in denying their motion for reconsideration and in refusing to admit 
their amended complaint. Again we find this assignment of error to be without 
merit. While it is true that under the liberal provisions of our Rules of Court, 
amendments to pleadings are favored and liberally allowed in the furtherance of 
justice, it is obvious that when it appears from the very face of the complaint 
that the Court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the case, an 
amendment of the complaint can not be allowed so as to confer jurisdiction upon 
the Court. In Alvarez, et al. <em>vs</em>. Commonwealth of the Phil., et al., 65 
Phil., 302, this Court held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under. this section (Sec. 101 of the Code of Civ. Pro. the amendment of a 
pleading, after a demurrer is sustained, is not an absolute right of the 
pleader;, the amendment rests rather in the sound discretion of the court. 
Generally when a demurrer is sustained, the party who presented the defective 
pleading is afforded an opportunity to amend it under conditions which the court 
may fix; and this should be done when it appears clearly that the defect is 
remediable by amendment (Molina <em>vs</em>. La Electricista, 6 Phil., 519; 
Serrano <em>vs</em>. Serrano, 9 Phil., 142; Segovia <em>vs</em>. Provincial 
Board of Albay, 13 Phil., 331; Balderrama <em>vs</em>. Compania General de 
Tabacos, 13 Phil., 609; Macapinlac <em>vs</em>. Gutierrez Repide, 43 Phil., 
770). But when it is evident that the court has no jurisdiction over the person 
and the subject matter that the pleading is so fatally defective as not to be 
susceptible of amendment, or that to permit such amendment would radically alter 
the theory and the'nature of the action, then the court may refuse the amendment 
of the defective pleading and order the dismissal of the case (49 C. J., sec. 
563, p. 457; Sar Joaquin etc., Canal, etc., Co. <em>vs</em>. Stanislaus County, 
155 Cal., 21; Bell. <em>vs</em>. California Bank, 153 Cal., 234; Ridgway 
<em>vs</em>. Pogan, 2 Cal. Unrep. Cas., 718; Schlecht <em>vs</em>. Schlecht, 277 
F. 1065; Beal <em>vs</em>. United Properties Co., 46 Cal. A., 287; Bemartini 
<em>vs</em>. Marini, 45 Cal. A. 418; Lentz <em>vs</em>. Clough, 39 Cal. A., 430; 
Burki <em>vs</em>. Pleasanton School District., 18 Cal. A., 493; Patterson 
<em>vs</em>. Steele, 93 Neb., 209; Cox <em>vs</em>. Gerogia R., etc. Co., 139 
Ga., 532; Peo. <em>vs</em>. McHatton, 7 111., 731; Higgins <em>vs</em>. Degney, 
25 Misc., 248; 55 N. Y. S., 59; Wood <em>vs</em>. Anderson, 25 Pa., 407). 
Section 101 authorizing the amendment of a defective pleading should be 
liberally construed and the courts, whenever possible, should incline in favor 
of the amendment; but when it appears patent that the pleading is not 
susceptible of amendment upon the grounds above set out, the appellate courts 
should not hold that the former have abused their discretion in not permitting 
the amendment and in dismissing the case."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellants' original complaint, as we have already determined, is one for 
forcible entry and detainer, over which the Court below has no jurisdiction. Not 
having acquired jurisdiction' over the case by the filing of the original 
complaint, the lower court has neither the power nor the jurisdiction to act on 
the motion for the admission of the amended complaint, much less to allow such 
amendment, since it is elementary that the court must first acquire jurisdiction 
over the case in order to act validly therein. Wherefore, the Court below did 
not err in refusing to admit plaintiffs-appellants' amended complaint. </p>
<p>The case might be different had the amendment been made before an answer or a 
motion to dismiss had been filed, since the original complaint was then 
amendable, and the amendment could supersede the original pleading, as <em>of 
right</em>, without leave of court being required, and without the Court taking 
cognizance at all of the original complaint.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the orders appealed from are affirmed, without 
prejudice to appellants' filing another case for <em>reivindicacion</em>. Costs 
against appellants.,</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador,</em> and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Orders affirmed.</em></p></div>
