				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan 
which holds that the rights of the petitioner, the Republic of the Philippines, 
under and pursuant to the contract of lease with an option to purchase, are 
preferred or enjoy priority over whatever rights Ernest H. Burt may have in the 
parcels of land described in transfer certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 
28507; and directs Ernest H. Burt to surrender within 60 days from the last date 
of publication of the Court order the duplicates for the owner of transfer 
certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 28507, and the Registrar of Deeds in and 
for the province of Bulacan to enter a memorandum of the contract of lease with 
an option to purchase in favor of the petitioner on the original certificates of 
title Nos. 428 and 494 and on transfer certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 
28507, with the statement that the right of the petitioner is preferred or 
enjoys priority over whatever right Ernest H. Burt might have acquired in and 
over the parcels of land therein described.
<p align="justify">On 4 March 1939, the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the 
San Juan de Dios Hospital entered into a contract whereby the latter leased to 
the former three (3) parcels of land described in original certificate of title 
No. 426 and one (1) parcel of land described in original certificate of title 
No. 4941 issued by the Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of Bulacan, 
for a period of twenty five (25) years beginning the 1st day of January 1939, 
with an option in favor of the lessee, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, to 
purchase the parcels of land within the period of the lease (Exhibit A). On 15 
March, the contract of lease with an option to purchase was presented for 
registration in the office of the Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of 
Bulacan and noted in the entry or day book (Exhibit A). The entry was the 
22495th or bears No. 22495. The original of the contract of lease with an option 
to purchase and a photostatic copy thereof were presented and shown to the 
Registrar for the latter to check up the copy with the original, as the latter 
was to be immediately withdrawn and kept in the Executive Office as a State 
document. On 21 March, the Registrar requested by letter the officer who 
presented for registration the lease contract with an option to purchase to send 
P0.50 to pay the filing fee (Exhibit 1-A). For failure te pay the fee the 
Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of Bulacan did not enter a Memorandum 
of the contract of lease with an option to purchase on the back of original 
certificates of title Nos. 428 and 494. On 29 June 1946, the San Juan de Dios 
Hospital sold and conveyed to Ernest H. Burt the parcels of land described in 
the original certificates of title Nos. 428 and 494, together with another 
parcel of land described in certificate of title No. 14209, and upon 
presentation of the deed of sale with a mortgage to the Registrar of Deeds in 
and for the province of Bulacan on 1 July 1946, the original certificates of 
title Nos. 428 and 494 were cancelled and, in lieu thereof, transfer 
certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 28507 were issued in the name of Ernest H. 
Burt. As the contract of lease with an option to purchase in favor of the 
Commonwealth Government was not noted on the original certificates of title Nos. 
423 and 494, transfer certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 28507 were issued in 
the name of Ernest H. Burt without such notation. Nevertheless, in the deed of 
sale with mortgage executed by the San Juan de Dios Hospital in favor of Ernest 
H. Burt reference is made to the contract of lease with an option to purchase 
executed by the San Juan de Dios Hospital in favor of the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines (Exhibits B &amp; 5). In August 1946, in the course of an 
Investigation conducted by the Landed Estates Committee of the House of 
Representatives of the Congress of the Philippines the petitioner, the Republic 
of the Philippines, as successor in interest of the lessee, the Commonwealth of 
the Philippines, case to know for the first time of the failure of the Registrar 
of Deeds in and for the province of Bulacan to enter a memorandum of the 
contract of lease with aa option to purchase on the back of the original 
certificates of title Nos. 428 and 494.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition in this case is filed, under and pursuant to the 
provisions of section 112 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496), in the 
original record of the land registration case (G.L.R.O. Record No. 7605), in 
which the decree had been entered and upon which original certificates of title 
Nos. 428 and 494 were subsequently issued by the Registrar of Deeds in and for 
the province of Bulacan.</p>
<p align="justify">The last proviso of section 56, Act 496, as amended by Act 3300 
reads a follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<i>Provided, further</i>, That the Insular Government and the 
provincial and municipal governments need not pay such fees in advance in order 
to be entitled to entry or registration."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">When he required by letter the officer, who brought for 
registration the original contract of lease with an option to purchase and a 
photostatic copy thereof duly certified by the notary public before whom it was 
acknowledged, to pay the filing fee, and when by reason of the failure of the 
officer to pay such fee he refused or failed to enter a memorandum of the 
contract of lease with an option to purchase on the original certificates of 
title Nos. 428 and 494 and on the duplicates for the owner issued in the name of 
the San Juan de Dios Hospital after the notation thereof la the entry or day 
book, the Registrar of Deeds in aid for the province of Bulacan overlooked the 
provisio of said proviso. The general provisions of section 56, as amended, as 
to nullity of the registration in the entry or day book, if the filing and 
registration fees are not paid within 15 days after the date of registration in 
the entry or day book, do not apply to the Insular, provincial and municipal 
governments. The Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of Bulacan was in 
duty bound not only to register or annotate the contract of lease with an option 
to purchase presented to him for registration on 15 March 1939 in the entry or 
day book, but also to enter a memorandum thereof on the original certificates of 
title Nos. 426 and 494 to which the lease contract with an option to purchase 
had reference, without payment in advance of the filing and registration fees. 
Had he refused or failed to perform his duty, he could have been compelled, as 
he can be compelled, to perform it by special action for <i>mandamus</i>. But 
the petitioner, the successor in interest of the lessee, instead of filing a 
special action for <i>mandamus</i>, chose the remedy provided for in section 112 
of the Land Registration Act (Act 496). There exists no legal objection to such 
a choice.</p>
<p align="justify">Section 112, Act 496, in part provides the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Any registered owner or <i>other person in interest</i> may at 
any time apply by petition to the Court, upon the ground * * * that any 
<i>error, omission,</i> or <i>mistake</i> was made in <i>entering a 
certificate</i> or any memorandum thereon or on any duplicate certificate; * * * 
or upon any other reasonable ground; and the Court shall have jurisdiction to 
hear and determine the petition after notice to all parties in interest, and may 
order the entry of a new certificate, the <i>entry</i> or cancellation of a 
<i>memorandum upon a certificate</i>, or <i>grant any other relief upon such 
terms and conditions</i>, requiring security if necessary, as it may deem 
proper: <i>Provided, however</i>, That this section shall not be construed to 
give the court authority to open the original decree of registration, and that 
nothing shall be done or ordered by the court which shall impair the title or 
other interest of a purchaser holding a certificate for value and in good faith, 
or his heirs or assigns, without his or their written consent." (Italic 
ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Under the provisions just copied, the petitioner is entitled to 
apply by petition to the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, acting as Land 
Registration Court, to have the error or mistake of the Registrar of Deeds in 
and for the province of Bulacan corrected by an order directing him to annotate 
the contract of lease with an option to purchase on the original certificates of 
title Nos. 426 and 494 and to have the omission of said Registrar supplied by an 
order instructing him to record the contract of lease with an option to purchase 
on transfer certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 28507; and the Court has 
jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition after notice to all parties in 
interest, and after hearing may order the entry of a memorandum of such lease 
contract with an option to purchase on the original certificates of title Nos. 
423 and 494 and on transfer certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 28507, or grant 
any other relief upon such terms and conditions as it may deem proper.</p>
<p align="justify">As provided for in the section commented upon, the hearing and 
determination of the petition cannot be held and made without notice to all 
parties in interest. This brings us to the point whether a Land Registration 
Court after notifying all the parties in interest may determine that a party in 
interest holding a certificate to be annotated is or is not a purchaser for 
value and in good faith. That part of the section which clothes the Court with 
jurisdiction and authority to "grant any other relief upon such terns and 
conditions, * * * as it nay deem proper," we believe is sufficient authority to 
make such finding or pronouncement. In this particular case, not only does the 
law authorize the Court to make it, but also the opponents and appellants in 
their pleadings submitted to the Court the claim that the opponent and appellant 
Ernest H. Burt is a purchaser for value and in good faith; and in support of 
their claim they introduced at the hearing parole and documentary evidence. To 
decide whether the Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of Bulacan can be 
compelled or directed, pursuant to the provisions of section 112 of the Land 
Registration Act, to make an entry or memorandum of the contract of lease with 
an option to purchase, an entry or memorandum which would affect a party who had 
acquired an interest in the parcels of land described in the original 
certificates of title Nos. 428 and 494 and is a holder of transfer certificates 
of title issued in lieu of the original certificates, the other question whether 
the holder of such transfer certificates of title is a purchaser for value and 
in good faith has to be passed upon. It cannot be sidetracked, especially taking 
into consideration the provision of said section "that nothing shall be done or 
ordered by the Court which shall impair the title or other interest of a 
purchaser holding a certificate for value and in good faith, or his heirs or 
assigns, without his or their written consent."</p>
<p align="justify">On the point whether the appellant Ernest H. Burt as holder of 
transfer certificates of title Nos. 28506 and 28507 is a purchaser for value and 
in good faith, we hold with the Court below that he is not. He had notice of the 
contract of lease with an option to purchase, reference to which is made in the 
very deed of sale with mortgage executed by him and the authorized officers of 
the San Juan de Dios Hospital (Exhibits B &amp; 5). The information imparted to 
him or to his attorney by the officers of the San Juan de Dios Hospital as to 
the alleged resolution or cancellation of the contract of lease with an option 
to purchase does not and cannot bind the petitioner. If it was an erroneous 
information as to the law on the subject and the appellant Ernest H. Burt 
believed it and acted upon it, the petitioner is not and cannot be bound 
thereby. If any party is responsible for such an erroneous information, it must 
be the officer or officers of the San Juan de Dios Hospital who had given it. 
But the error of the information is so crass that no one it would believe and, 
if anyone did believe it, he would be chargeable with gross contributory 
negligence, for it is obvious that a bilateral contract, such as a contract of 
lease with an option to purchase, could not and cannot be resolved by one party 
without a judicial decree to afford the other party an opportunity to be heard. 
Such is the law found in article 1124 of the Civil Code invoked by the 
appellants. Furthermore, the down payment of P10,000 made by the vendee, a 
trifle as compared to the purchase price of P5,000,000, is a proof that the 
vendee was in doubt as to whether the parcels of land he was purchasing were 
really free or released from the petitioner's leasehold right and option to 
purchase.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the claim of the San Juan de Dios Hospital that the 
predecessor in interest of the petitioner as well as the latter had breached the 
contract of lease with an option to purchase by failure to pay in advance the 
yearly rentals stipulated in the lease contract during the first fifteen days of 
January each year, the lessee having failed to pay the rentals from 1942 to 
1946; to deliver and pay to the lessor the proceeds of the sale of lots of the 
estate; and for selling lots to tenants at a price higher than the cost; for 
increasing the rentals to a rate higher than those collected by the lessor; for 
selling ricelands when the lessee was only authorized to sell the residential 
lots, the lessee having sold nearly 6,000 hectares of ricelands for a price of 
more than P4,000,000, suffice it to repeat what has just been said that, in 
order to resolve or cancel a contract or a reciprocal obligation by reason of or 
for such breaches, a judicial action must be brought to secure the resolution of 
the contract. Besides, there is no evidence but only an offer by counsel at the 
hearing to prove the breaches of the contract. All these alleged breaches were 
committed, as may be gathered from the statements of counsel at the hearing, 
during the Japanese occupation. Needless to say, those breaches even if proved 
do not and cannot bind and prejudice the petitioner. As to the failure to pay 
the stipulated yearly rental, the predecessor in interest of the petitioner was 
prevented from paying it due to the country's occupation by the enemy.</p>
<p align="justify">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellants.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Bengzon, Tuason, Reyes,</i> and 
<i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
