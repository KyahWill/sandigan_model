				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In view  of  an order of the Court of First  Instance of Rizal in Civil Case No. 1461-P, dismissing his petition for prohibition  and mandamus  with  preliminary injunction,  on the ground of failure to prosecute,  Manuel Masiglat has appealed to this Court. <br><br>The facts essential  to a  proper disposition of this  appeal may be stated as follows: <br><br>Petitioner Manuel  Masiglat was a lieutenant in  the Pasay City Police Department when he was suspended by the City Mayor, Enrique Manaloto, following the  filing of administrative charges against him with the Municipal Board of the said city.  The charges involved misconduct in office, irregular performance  of duty  and violation of law, on three specifications  as follows:  (1)  having solicited votes, accompanied voters to  electoral precincts, given away free food  and  drinks to voters;  (2) having carried his gun inside the prohibited area in the electoral precinct; and (3)  use for electioneering purposes of a government jeep assigned to him. <br><br>As the administrative case was still pending upon the expiration of sixty  (60)  days from his  suspension, Masiglat  asked the City Mayor to reinstate him forthwith pursuant to section 3  of Republic Act No. 557. <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>  The  refusal  of the respondent mayor to do  so prompted Masiglat to file this case  against the respondent municipal officers for prohibition and mandamus with preliminary injunction on May 7, 1954. <br><br>Acting on the petition for  preliminary mandatory  injunction, the lower court on  May 26,  1954, ordered petitioner's reinstatement  pending the final.determination of the case. <br><br>On July  27,  1954,  the Municipal Board  decided  the administrative case against petitioner Masiglat, declaring him guilty of charges  1 and 3 and  sentencing him to be separated from the service.  A petition for reconsideration to this decision having been denied by the said Board, the petitioner perfected his appeal with the Commissioner of Civil Service, which appeal is being held in abeyance pending the final disposition of this petition. <br><br>On August 18, 1964, petitioner filed a motion to declare the City Mayor, the City Treasurer and the Chief  of Police in contempt of court for having  again effected his separation as of August 11,  1954, following the decision of the Municipal Board, notwithstanding the writ of preliminary injunction.  Acting on the said motion,  the trial court, on September 27, 1954, issued an  order absolving respondents  from  contempt,  but upholding  its  previous preliminary  mandatory injunction by  ordering that  it remain in full force and effect.<br><br>In the local elections held in November, 1955, a new set  of  omcials were elected,  namely: Pablo Cuneta, as Mayor;  and  Ruperto Galvez, Ansberto Paredes, Eduardo Vitocruz, Pascual  Cruz, Nicanor  Santos, Luis  Cabrido and Irineo Gallegos, as jnembers of the  Municipal Board. <br><br>In accordance  with section 18, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, and upon motion of petitioner, the trial  court on June 16, 1956, ordered the new members of the Municipal Board to manifest within 30 days from notice their stand whether or not they desire to uphold the action of their predecessors.  The order was received  by petitioner  on August 1, 1956, and by  respondent members of the Municipal Board on  July 26, 1956, who answered that they stood by the action already taken.  Thereafter,  nothing more was done about the case until October 19, 1956, when the lower court issued an order dismissing the same for failure to prosecute.  A motion for reconsideration was denied; hence, this appeal by petitioner Masiglat. <br><br>The main issue raised here is whether or not petitioner failed to  prosecute his action for an <span style="font-style: italic;">unreasonable length of time</span>. <br><br>The pertinent provision of the Rules of Court on this point is contained in section 3, Rule 30, which reads: <br><blockquote>SEC.  3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Failure  to  prosecute</span>.â€”When plaintiff fails to  appear at the time of the trial, or <span style="font-style: italic;">to prosecute his action for  an unreasonable  length of time</span>, or to comply  with  these  rules or any order of the court, the  action  may be  dismissed upon  motion  of  the defendant  or  upon  the court's own motion.  This  dismissal shall have the effect of an adjudication upon the merits, unless otherwise provided by court."</blockquote>What would constitute  "unreasonable length of  time" depends upon the circumstances  of each particular case and  the sound discretion of the court will not be disturbed in the absence  of patent abuse  (Smith Bell  &amp; Co.  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> American President Lines Ltd., 94 Phil.,  879; Brandt <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Behn, Mayer &amp; Co., 38 Phil.,  351).  In  the  instant case, we  find  the order appealed from entirely justified, considering  that from  the time  issues  were  joined,  on December 14, 1954,  petitioner  Masiglat  took no steps to  have  the  case tried  until   one and a  half  years thereafter, on May 4,  1956, when appellant asked that it be set for hearing; and when the court did set the trial for the 25th day of that month, appellant further delayed it by  filing  a supplemental petition that naturally called for  a similar answer  on the part  of respondents.  It is not  difficult to realize that having  secured his reinstatement  through the preliminary mandatory injunction of May 26,   1954,  petitioner thereafter lost interest in a prompt decision on the merits,  lest the  advantage he had thus obtained should  be  forfeited.  Thus, no reason  is shown why appellant could not have filed sooner the supplemental petition  of May 25,  1956, that merely  alleged his  dismissal  by the Municipal  Board of Pasay  City on July 27,  1954.  Likewise, the motion of June 13,  1956, to require the new  Municipal Board, elected in  November 1955, to manifest if it stood by the decision of its  predecessor,  could have  been filed  much earlier if petitioner had been reminded  to secure an early disposition  of his case. <br><blockquote>"It is well-known  policy of the courts  to expedite the disposal of cases and  to  prevent the clogging  of  the dockets.  It is incumbent upon the parties, especially the plaintiff, to take the initiative  in the  prompt disposal of these cases as a duty to themselves, to  the courts, and the public in general" (E.E. Elser, Inc. et al.  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. 96 Phil., 395).  This principle should be more strictly adhered to where, as in this case,  the appellant is prosecuting a special  civil  action  and a  preliminary injunction has been granted therein.</blockquote>It is next urged by appellant  that the lower court erred in not passing upon the legality of  the Municipal Board's decision dismissing  him from the  service,  which he assails as promulgated in his absence and at a time when the Board was not in session.   Having arrived, however, at the conclusion that there was no abuse  of discretion in the dismissal of the  petition, this particular question has become moot.  Moreover, this issue may well be  decided in Masiglat's pending appeal to the Commissioner of the Civil Service. Wherefore,  the order of dismissal  appealed from is affirmed.  Costs against appellant.  So ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.J.,  Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,  Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,  Concepcion,  Endencia,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix,  JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> Sec. 3. When charges are filed against a member of the provincial guards, city police  or  municipal police  under this Act, the provincial governor, city mayor  or municipal  mayor, as the case may be, may suspend  the accused, and said suspension to be not longer than sixty days.  If during the period of  sixty days, the case  shall  not  have been  decided finally,  the accused,  if he is suspended, shall <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> be reinstated in office without prejudice to the continuation  of the  case until its final  decision,  unless the delay in the disposition of the case is due to the fault, negligence, or petition of the accused, in  which case the  period of the delay shall  not be counted in computing the period  of  suspension herein provided. <br></div>
