				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the orders of dismissal of the two above entitled 
cases for failure of the plaintiffs-appellants to prosecute them under section 
3, Rule 30.
<p>In case G. R. No. L-5325, and in case G. R. No. L-5326,the 
defendants-appellees filed their answers in May and June, 1947, respectively, 
and the two cases were ready for trial in those months. The 
plaintiffs-appellants did not do anything until August, 1951, a period of four 
years, to have the cases tried by the Court of First Instance of Manila. In view 
of this delay of four years, the court below was constrained to order the 
dismissal of the two above mentioned cases. The appellants put up the excuse 
that there were five hundred similar cases which had to be distributed before 
the different branches of the Court of First Instance of Manila, and that was 
the reason why they did not ask for the trial of those two cases as they were 
waiting for the distribution of those other cases. This is not a valid excuse; 
it was the duty of the plaintiffs-appellants to see to it that the two cases 
were set for trial. It is true that the deputy clerk of court concerned should 
have set for trial, <em>motu proprio</em>, those two cases under sections 1, 2, 
and 3 of Rule 31. But it has been held by this Court in the cases of "Smith Bell 
&amp; Co., Ltd., and Insurance Company of North America, et al. <em>vs</em>. 
American President Lines Ltd., and/or Manila Terminal Co., Inc., et al., G.R. 
Nos. L-5304 to L-5324", that the said duty of the deputy clerk of court does not 
relieve the plaintiff from his obligation to have his case set for trial. Four 
years is quite a long time, and if the plaintiffs-appellants were really 
interested in their cases, we cannot imagine how they left a quadrennial pass 
with crossed-arms and without doing anything. It is a well known policy of the 
courts to expedite the disposal of cases and to prevent the clogging of the 
dockets. It is incumbent upon the parties, especially the plaintiffs, to take 
the initiative in the prompt disposal of their cases as a duty to themselves, to 
the courts, and to the public in general. In the performance of this duty the 
plaintiffs-appellants have failed for an excessive length of time without 
exerting ordinary or even special efforts to have their cases disposed of. It 
was only a few days before they received notice of orders of dismissal that they 
became aware and attempted to have them set for hearing. It is the duty and 
right of the courts to dismiss a suit for failure to prosecute it with due 
diligence. Due diligence has been lacking on the part of the 
plaintiffs-appellants. This court can correct the order of dismissal of the 
court below only in case of abuse of power or discretion. In view of the 
circumstances of these cases, we cannot attribute such abuse to the trial court. 
The present cases are almost exactly on-all-fours with the cases above 
cited.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the orders of dismissal appealed from are affirmed, 
with costs against the appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order affirmed</em>.</p></div>
