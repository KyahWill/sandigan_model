				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff is the owner of a&nbsp; Studebaker car&nbsp; with Plate No. 3414 while defendant is an operator of a fleet of taxicabs.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; such&nbsp; operator,&nbsp; defendant has&nbsp; in its employ a driver by&nbsp; the name of&nbsp; Quirino Ramos y Codier.&nbsp; Sometime&nbsp; in 1947 a collision&nbsp; took place between&nbsp; the taxicab driven by&nbsp; Ramos and the&nbsp; car belonging to the&nbsp; plaintiff, as a result of which a criminal&nbsp; action&nbsp; was instituted against Ramos&nbsp; charging him with having driven his car in a reckless&nbsp; and&nbsp; imprudent manner.&nbsp; Ramos entered&nbsp; a&nbsp; plea of guilty and, accordingly,&nbsp; was&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; indemnify the offended party in the sum of P2,318.40.&nbsp; A writ of execution was issued for the satisfaction of&nbsp; the imdemnity but it was returned unsatisfied for lack of property belonging to Ramos which&nbsp; could be levied&nbsp; upon.<p>Having been unable to recover the indemnity awarded in his favor,&nbsp; plaintiff commenced the present action in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila against defendant seeking to collect the amount of P2,318.40 based&nbsp; on the latter's subsidiary liability under the provisions&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Defendant,&nbsp; in its answer, admitted that Quirino Ramos y Codier was in its employ as a taxicab&nbsp; driver but denied all other&nbsp; allegations,&nbsp; particularly with regard to the indemnity,&nbsp; on the ground that it had no knowledge or&nbsp; information sufficient to form a belief as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; Considering that&nbsp; this answer does not&nbsp; categorically deny the&nbsp; principal allegations of the complaint, plaintiff filed&nbsp; a motion for&nbsp; summary judgment supported by an affidavit&nbsp; attaching thereto certified copies of&nbsp; the decision rendered in the criminal case, the writ of execution and the sheriff's&nbsp; return of the&nbsp; writ. Defendant filed a written opposition&nbsp; contending that its answer was sufficient in form to&nbsp; raise issues of material facts,&nbsp; and the court&nbsp; after&nbsp; considering the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; and the opposition thereto, issued an order denying the same.</p><p> When the case&nbsp; was called for&nbsp; hearing, plaintiff again raised the point that the case could be submitted for decision without&nbsp; the necessity&nbsp; of&nbsp; cross-examination&nbsp; of the plaintiff by defendant regarding&nbsp; his&nbsp; claim for damages. The court, over the objection of&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; declared the case submitted for decision and&nbsp; rendered judgment ordering defendant to pay to plaintiff the sum of P2,318.40, with legal interest thereon from November,&nbsp; 1947&nbsp; and to&nbsp; pay the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; From this&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; has appealed.</p><p>The main issue raised by defendant is that the lower court&nbsp; erred in allowing the case to be&nbsp; submitted for decision without&nbsp; giving&nbsp; said&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; an&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; cross-examine&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; regarding his&nbsp; claim for damages because&nbsp; such claim was never admitted as in fact it was denied when in its answer&nbsp; it stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; it did not have sufficient knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth thereof.&nbsp; In other words, defendant contends that in so alleging that it&nbsp; did not have sufficient knowledge&nbsp; or information to form a belief as to the claim for damages, it tendered an issue of fact which takes this case out of the rule relative to summary judgment.</p><p>It is true&nbsp; that under&nbsp; section 7, Rule 9 "Where the defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of a material averment made in the complaint,&nbsp; he shall so state, and this shall have the effect of a <span style="font-style: italic;">denial</span>", but "mere denials, unaccompanied&nbsp; by any facts&nbsp; which&nbsp; would&nbsp; be admissable&nbsp; in&nbsp; evidence at a hearing, are not&nbsp; sufficient to raise&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">genuine issue</span> of fact sufficient to defeat a motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; summary judgment" (Piantadosi <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Loew's Inc., 7 Fed. Rules Service, 786, June 2, 1943).&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; was also held&nbsp; that&nbsp; "Summary judgment is proper where there is no&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">genuine</span>&nbsp; issue of fact, even though an issue may be raised&nbsp; formally by the pleadings"&nbsp; (Fletche <em>vs.</em> Krise,&nbsp; 4&nbsp; Fed. Rules&nbsp; Service, 765, March 3,&nbsp; 1941).&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)&nbsp; And that "Where all&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts are within the judicial knowledge&nbsp; of the court, summary judgment may&nbsp; be granted as a matter of law" (Fletcher <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Evening Newspaper Co. 3 Fed. Rules Service, 530, June 28,&nbsp; 1940).</p><p>The question that now arise is: Is the&nbsp; issue tendered by defendant in its answer a<span style="font-style: italic;"> genuine</span> one?</p><p>We do not, believe so for it merely refers to the amount of damages the defendant is made subsidiarily liable&nbsp; by the Revised Penal Code which already appears in the decision rendered against its employee in the criminal case. That decision&nbsp; is&nbsp; binding and conclusive upon defendant not only with regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; its civil liability&nbsp; but also with regard to its amount because the liability of an employer cannot be&nbsp; separated but follows that&nbsp; of his employee. That is why the&nbsp; law says that his liability is subsidiary (Article 103, Revised Penal Code).&nbsp;&nbsp; To allow an employer to&nbsp; dispute the&nbsp; civil liability&nbsp; fixed in the&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; case would be&nbsp; to amend, nullify&nbsp; or&nbsp; defeat&nbsp; a final&nbsp; judgment rendered by&nbsp; a competent court.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cannot be&nbsp; done&nbsp; as may be implied&nbsp; from the following comment of this Court:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The important question&nbsp; is&nbsp; whether a&nbsp; judgment of conviction sentencing the defendant to pay an indemnity is&nbsp; conclusive in&nbsp; an action against his employer for the&nbsp; enforcement of the latter's subsidiary liability under&nbsp; articles&nbsp; 102&nbsp; and 103 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; decision makes reference to two&nbsp; earlier decisions of this Court,&nbsp; namely, City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila va.&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; Electric Co., 52 Phil., 586, holding&nbsp; that such judgment of conviction&nbsp; is not admissible, and Arambulo&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Manila Electric&nbsp; Co., 55&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 75, in effect holding that it is merely <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence, and to the prevailing view in the&nbsp; United States to the effect that the person subsidiarily liable&nbsp; is bound by the judgment if the former had notice of the&nbsp; criminal case and could have defended it had he seen fit to do so,&nbsp; and that otherwise such judgment is only <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence.&nbsp; <br></p><p>"After&nbsp; very&nbsp; careful&nbsp; reflection, we have&nbsp; arrived at the opinion that the judgment of conviction,&nbsp; in the absence of any collusion between the defendant and the offended party&nbsp; should bind the person&nbsp; subsidiarily liable. The stigma of a&nbsp; criminal conviction surpasses&nbsp; in&nbsp; effect&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; implications&nbsp; mere&nbsp; civil liability.&nbsp; Common sense dictates that a finding of guilt&nbsp; in a&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; case&nbsp; in&nbsp; which proof&nbsp; beyond reasonable doubt is&nbsp; necessary,&nbsp; should not&nbsp; be nullified&nbsp; in&nbsp; a subsequent&nbsp; civil&nbsp; action requiring&nbsp; only preponderance&nbsp; of evidence to&nbsp; support&nbsp; a judgment,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; those&nbsp; who&nbsp; support the contrary rule should&nbsp; also&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that an absolution in&nbsp; a&nbsp; civil case will operate to automatically set&nbsp;&nbsp; aside the&nbsp; verdict&nbsp; against&nbsp; the defendant in the criminal case.&nbsp; It is anomalous, to say the least, to suppose that the driver, excelling 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', could be guilty of reckless&nbsp; negligence in&nbsp; so far as his obligation&nbsp; to pay indemnity is concerned, and at the&nbsp; same time could be free from any blame when said indemnity is&nbsp; sought to be&nbsp; collected from his employer, although the&nbsp; right to the&nbsp; indemnity&nbsp; arose&nbsp; from and was based on one and&nbsp; the same act&nbsp; of the&nbsp; driver.</p><p>"The employer&nbsp; cannot be said to&nbsp; have been&nbsp; deprived of&nbsp; his day in court,&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; situation&nbsp; before&nbsp; us&nbsp; is not&nbsp; one wherein the employer is sued&nbsp; for&nbsp; a primary liability under article&nbsp; 1903 of the Civil Code, but one in which enforcement is&nbsp; sought of a subsidiary civil liability incident to and dependent upon his driver's criminal negligence which&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; proper&nbsp; issue to be tried and decided only in a criminal action.&nbsp; In other words, the employer becomes <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> subsdiarily liable&nbsp; upon his driver's&nbsp; conviction&nbsp; and upon&nbsp; proof&nbsp; of the tetter's&nbsp; insolvency, in the same&nbsp; way&nbsp; that&nbsp; acquittal wipes out not only the&nbsp; employee's&nbsp; primary&nbsp; civil&nbsp; liability but also&nbsp; his employer's subsidiary liability for such&nbsp; criminal negligence." (Martinez <em>vs.</em> Barredo, 45 Off. Gaz., No. 11, 4922.)</p></blockquote><p>It is true that an&nbsp; employer, strictly speaking, is&nbsp; not a&nbsp; party to&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal case instituted against&nbsp; his&nbsp; employee&nbsp; but in substance and&nbsp; in effect he is considering the subsdiary liability imposed&nbsp; upon&nbsp; him&nbsp; by law.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is his concern, as well as of his employee, to see to it that his interest be protected in the criminal case by taking virtual participation in the defense of his employee.&nbsp; He cannot leave him to his own&nbsp; fate because his failure is also&nbsp; his. And if because&nbsp; of&nbsp; his indifference or inaction the&nbsp; employee is&nbsp; convicted and damages are awarded against him, he cannot later be heard to complain, if brought to .court for the enforcement of his subsidiary liability, that he was not given his day in court.&nbsp; It was not without&nbsp; purpose that this Court&nbsp; sounded the following stern warning:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"It is high time that the employer&nbsp; exercised the greatest&nbsp; care in selecting his employees, taking&nbsp; real and deep interest in their welfare;<em> intervening in any criminal action&nbsp; brought against them by reason&nbsp; of or as a result of the performance&nbsp; of their' duties, if. only in the way of giving them the benefit&nbsp; of counsel; and consequently doing away with the practices of leaving them to their fates.</em> If these be done, the American rule requiring notice&nbsp; on the part of the employer shall have been satisfied.'"&nbsp; (Martinez&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Barredo,<span style="font-style: italic;"> supra.</span>)</p></blockquote><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</em>, and <em>Felix, JJ.</em>,&nbsp; concur.</p></div>
