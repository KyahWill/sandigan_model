				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a petition for&nbsp; certiorari filed by Eugenio de&nbsp; la Cruz&nbsp; against respondents Judges Juan Bocar and&nbsp; Emilio Rilloraza of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal, Pasay City Branch, and Rufina and Company.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts in this case as disclosed by the&nbsp; pleadings and their annexes may be briefly stated&nbsp; as follows.<p>On or about May 21,&nbsp; 1954, Rufina&nbsp; and Company filed a complaint for unlawful detainer in the Justice of the Peace Court later referred to as the&nbsp; Peace Court, of Malabon, Rizal,—Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1176,&nbsp; against Eugenio de&nbsp; la Cruz regarding a parcel of land in the municipality of Malabon with an area of 1,337&nbsp; square meters covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 33343 of the office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal province, said to have been bought by her from&nbsp; Balbino Ignacio, et al.&nbsp; Defendant-Petitioner&nbsp; Cruz filed a motion to dismiss&nbsp; the complaint on the ground that the Peace Court had no jurisdiction&nbsp; over the case because it involved question of title&nbsp; or ownership of the land in litigation and in support&nbsp; of his motion, he filed his application for purchase with the Bureau of Lands&nbsp; (Miscellaneous Sales&nbsp; Application No. V-25569).&nbsp; The&nbsp; motion to dismiss was denied by the Peace&nbsp; Court on July 1, 1954, and so was the motion for reconsideration on July 19, 1954, after which the Peace Court set the&nbsp; case for hearing.</p><p>To&nbsp; stop the proceedings in the&nbsp; Peace Court&nbsp; Cruz filed Civil Case No. 2819 in the Court of First Instance of Rizal for prohibition against the Justice of&nbsp; the Peace.&nbsp; Acting upon&nbsp; a motion to dismiss the petition respondent Judge Rilloraza in an order dated August 21, 1954, dismissed the petition for&nbsp; prohibition, holding&nbsp; that mere defense&nbsp; of ownership does not divest the Justice of the Peace Court of jurisdiction over an unlawful detainer&nbsp; case.&nbsp; Cruz did not appeal from this order of dismissal.&nbsp; Thereafter, the Peace Court&nbsp; proceeded with&nbsp; the hearing of the&nbsp; detainer case,&nbsp; after which it rendered judgment on&nbsp; October 14, 1954,&nbsp; ordering Cruz to&nbsp; vacate the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; and to pay costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruz appealed to&nbsp; the Court of First Instance,&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 3110, and he filed a&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss the complaint. Said motion&nbsp; was denied by Judge Rilloraza in an order&nbsp; dated February 13, 1955.</p><p>In the meantime, plaintiff&nbsp; Rufina and&nbsp; Company in the appealed case,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; the issuance&nbsp; of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the objection of Cruz, Judge Rilloraza in an order dated January 7,&nbsp; 1955, granted the motion upon the&nbsp; filing of a bond in the sum of P500,&nbsp; and a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction was actually issued on&nbsp; February 14, 1955.</p><p>To annul the orders denying his motion&nbsp; to dismiss the complaint in Civil Case No. 3110&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, and the order granting the petition for a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction in the same civil case, the present petition for certiorari was filed.</p><p>As regards&nbsp; the order&nbsp; denying&nbsp; defendant-petitioner's motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss the complaint&nbsp; in the&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; case (Civil Case No. 3110), we agree with the respondent Judge that a mere defense of ownership of the land involved in a detainer case does not divest a Justice of the Peace Court of jurisdiction.&nbsp; Consequently, the&nbsp; order denying the motion to&nbsp; dismiss was&nbsp; properly&nbsp; issued.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of ownership&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land said to be detained&nbsp; by defendant, as&nbsp; already&nbsp; stated, the same&nbsp; is registered&nbsp; land&nbsp; covered by Torrens title in the name of plaintiff Rufina and Company.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; other hand, the claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; ownership by defendant Cruz is based merely on a Miscellaneous Sales Application filed by him with&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands which upon the opposition of Rufina and Company, was rejected by the Bureau.&nbsp; It is true that the effect of said rejection of his said&nbsp; sales application was&nbsp; later suspended by the Director of Lands, subject to further investigation,&nbsp; but thereafter, the Director of Lands in his order of November 15, 1954, found&nbsp; that&nbsp; the sales application of Cruz&nbsp; encroached upon the land of Rufina and&nbsp; Company already covered by&nbsp; the torrens title;&nbsp; that&nbsp; excluding that portion overlapping the&nbsp; registered land,&nbsp; there remains only&nbsp; a small portion but this portion covers a canal or&nbsp; creek which Cruz seems to have filled up; and&nbsp; under the circumstances the Bureau withheld&nbsp; action&nbsp; on the Cruz' sales application to see whether the remaining portion was open and available for disposition&nbsp; because it may affect&nbsp; the rights of the public.&nbsp; From all this, it would appear that Cruz' claim of ownership&nbsp; of the land subject of the detainer case&nbsp; on&nbsp; the strength of which he sought to divest the Peace Court of jurisdiction is unfounded.&nbsp; Moreover, the order of the Court of First Instance in the prohibition case No. 2819 dismissing his&nbsp; petition&nbsp; and which case directly involved the jurisdiction of the Peace Court to hear and decide the pending detainer case, became final because Cruz failed to appeal from it, thereby making it conclusive as against him; and said Peace Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine said&nbsp; detainer 'case, as in fact it decided it against him.</p><p>With respect to the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction against Cruz in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 3110, of the Court of First Instance, we gather from the pleadings filed in the said Court marked as Annexes&nbsp; by both parties that petitioner Cruz&nbsp; claims that the petition for the issuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the writ was filed beyond the&nbsp; ten day period fixetf by Art. 1674 of the New Civil Code for the reason that the appeal was perfected on November 2, 1954, and the motion for the&nbsp; issuance of the writ was filed on November 23, 1954.&nbsp; Plaintiff Rufina and Company, however, explained that the said ten days should be counted not from the actual date of&nbsp; the perfection of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal but from the time&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was notified of said perfected appeal which was&nbsp; on November 19, 1954.</p><p>We agree with plaintiff-respondent.&nbsp; An appellee in&nbsp; a case&nbsp; appealed from the&nbsp; Justice of the Peace Court to&nbsp; the Court of First Instance is not&nbsp; called upon to be&nbsp; always on guard in&nbsp; the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace Court to ascertain the exact&nbsp; date&nbsp; and hour the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; is&nbsp; perfected.&nbsp; All that an&nbsp; appellee is expected to&nbsp; do is to wait for&nbsp; the official notice to him of said perfected appeal from&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; where the appeal is taken.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp; said&nbsp; appellee may be prematurely&nbsp; filing a petition for the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of a&nbsp; writ of preliminary&nbsp; mandatory injunction&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; before&nbsp; the appeal is actually&nbsp; received by&nbsp; the said&nbsp; court; and said appellee&nbsp; would not&nbsp; know&nbsp; how&nbsp; to&nbsp; entitle&nbsp; or number his petition, and the&nbsp; Clerk of Court may not&nbsp; admit said petition because there&nbsp; is as&nbsp; yet no&nbsp; case or record of a case to which it may be attached&nbsp; and&nbsp; incorporated.&nbsp; We, therefore, rule that&nbsp; the period of ten days mentioned in Article&nbsp; 1674 within which to&nbsp; file&nbsp; a petition for&nbsp; a writ of preliminary&nbsp; mandatory&nbsp; injunction should be&nbsp; counted from the date when the&nbsp; petitioning party is notified of the perfection&nbsp; of the appeal.</p><p>Defendant-petitioner Cruz also contends that Article 1674 of the Civil Code is not available to&nbsp; Rufina and Company for the reason that it had' no&nbsp; previous&nbsp; possession of the property&nbsp; in&nbsp; litigation.</p><p>Prior physical possession in the plaintiff in an unlawful detainer case is not an indispensable requisite where said plaintiff&nbsp; is a vendee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Cruz also claims that there being no relation&nbsp; of lessor and&nbsp; lessee&nbsp; between plaintiff Rufina and&nbsp; Company and himself, the provision of Article 1674 of the Civil Code is not applicable.&nbsp; From what we gather from the records, before Rufina and&nbsp; Company bought the land, the vendor had permitted Cruz to occupy a part of it and to build his house thereon, on what conditions and whether or&nbsp; not he was to&nbsp; pay rent, is not known.&nbsp; These conditions and the relation between the owner of the land and&nbsp; Cruz as&nbsp; a temporary occupant continued after the sale&nbsp; of the land. Thereafter, the vendee Rufina and Company made a demand upon&nbsp; De la Cruz to vacate the portion occupied by him but he refused.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is not necessary that there be a formal agreement or contract »of lease&nbsp; between the&nbsp; vendor&nbsp; or&nbsp; vendee&nbsp; and&nbsp; Cruz.&nbsp; For the&nbsp; purposes of Article 1674 of the Civil Code, it is enough that the plaintiff is the owner of the land and the defendant is in temporary occupancy thereof whether under a&nbsp; lease contract or on mere tolerance or under a temporary permit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where after the&nbsp; termination of&nbsp; the lease contract&nbsp; or the&nbsp; revocation of the permit&nbsp; the lessee or occupant unlawfully prolongs his occupation&nbsp; of the premises, there is unlawful detainer. It is therefore clear that Article&nbsp; 1674 of the Civil Code is applicable to&nbsp; the present&nbsp; case.</p><p>In view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing,&nbsp; finding the&nbsp; orders of the Court of First Instance issued by the respondents Judges to be&nbsp; in accordance with law,&nbsp; the petition for&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>&nbsp; is hereby denied, with costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
