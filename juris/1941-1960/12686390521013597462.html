				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On August 6, 1943, Marieta J. Rotea and her husband Santiago 
Rotea applied for voluntary insolvency in the court of First Instance of 
Manila.
<p align="justify">On October 27, 1943, the court by an order subsequently 
amended, granted the petition, ordered the sheriff of Manila to take possession 
of and safely keep, until the appointment of an assignee, all the goods, papers, 
books of account, and all real and personal property of the debtors, except such 
as may be exempt from execution. It set December 11, 1943 as the day for the 
meeting of the creditors of the insolvent for the election of an assignee.</p>
<p align="justify">On the above designated day no creditors attended the meeting 
and no assignee was elected.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon motion of some creditors the court designated the Bank of 
the Philippine Islands as the assignee; but this institution declined the 
appointment for reasons which need not be mentioned. And so far as the record 
shows no assignee has up to this time qualified.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime certain creditors either filed their claims or 
joined the proceedings, namely, the Finance and Investment Corporation, the 
Ipekdjian Brothers, Inc., the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the Levy 
Hermanos, Inc., and the Levy &amp; Blum, Inc.</p>
<p align="justify">About the end of the year 1944, the insolvents, allegedly by 
"dint of hard work and through the help of relatives", acquired funds sufficient 
to cover their full indebtedness and made tender of payment. The first three 
creditors received the money. The last two refused payment. Wherefore the 
debtors purchased two manager's checks of the Philippine National Bank payable 
to the said two creditors in the amount of their credits and deposited such 
checks with the clerk of the court of first instance of Manila. That was on 
January 2, 1945. At the same time the debtors petitioned the court to order the 
said two creditors to collect and receive from the clerk their respective 
manager's checks in satisfaction of their claims. As the motion was not acted 
upon until January 22, 1945, the debtors with the permission of the court 
withdrew the checks from the clerk, cashed them and deposited the proceeds with 
the sheriff on the theory that he was acting in the place of the assignee who 
had not yet been selected.</p>
<p align="justify">Thereafter liberation came.</p>
<p align="justify">On October 31, 1946, the insolvent debtors submitted a petition 
for the arrest and final dismissal of the insolvency proceedings, because "with 
the full payment of three creditors mentioned in the schedule" and the payment 
to the sheriff of the claims of those who rejected the amounts tendered, all the 
credits against the petitioners had become fully paid, and there was no longer 
any necessity for the continuation of the insolvency proceedings. Levy Hermanos, 
Inc. and Levy &amp; Blum, Inc. opposed the petition, which was consequently 
denied by Judge Emilio Pe√±a on December 27, 1946.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioners appealed.</p>
<p align="justify">This appeal may not be entertained. In the first place, the 
petition for dismissal of the proceedings was filed under Section 81 of the 
Insolvency Law which clearly says that "if no creditor files written objections" 
the court <i>may</i> grant the application.</p>
<p align="justify">In the second place, the statute specifically mentions the 
cases in which appeal may be taken (Sec. 82), namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. From an order granting or refusing an adjudication of 
insolvency and, in the latter case, from the order fixing the amount of costs, 
expenses, damages, and attorney's fees, allowed the debtor.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. From an order made at the hearing of any account of an 
assignee, allowing or rejecting a creditor's claim in whole or in part, when the 
amount in dispute exceeds three hundred pesos.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. From an order allowing or denying a claim for property not 
belonging to the insolvent, presented under section forty-eight of this Act.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. From an order settling an account of an assignee.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. From an order against or in favor of setting apart 
homestead or other property claimed as exempt from execution.</p>
<p align="justify">"6. From an order granting or refusing a discharge to the 
debtor."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">This appeal does not fall within any of the above classes. It 
may not be contended that it is an appeal from an order refusing a discharge; 
because the petition was specifically made under section 81 of the Insolvency 
Law, and because upon a petition for discharge (secs. 64-69 of the insolvency) 
other issues might be involved.</p>
<p align="justify">With the dismissal of this appeal, the insolvency proceedings 
will proceed in accordance with law. So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor, Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
