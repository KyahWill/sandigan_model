				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Petitioner brought this petition for certiorari, injunction and mandamus to 
secure from this Court:<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) A writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the Court of First Instance 
of Manila, Branch IV (Probate Court), presently presided over by respondent Hon. 
Judge Gregorio S. Narvasa, from enforcing the orders of confiscation or 
forfeiture of herein petitioner's bond (Annex A), more particularly the orders 
of April 14, 1955, July 20, 1955, August 20, 1955, September 17, 1955, October 
31, 1955, December 6, 1955, and January 14, 1956;</p>
<p>(b) An order to set aside the Orders of March 15, 1956 and April 21, 1956, 
which declared that herein petitioner's notice of appeal, record on appeal, and 
appeal bond were filed not within the reglementary period allowed by law; 
and</p>
<p>(c) An order to require the respondent Hon. Judge Gregorio S. Narvasa to give 
due course to the appeal interposed by herein petitioner from the orders of 
confiscation and forfeiture, and to approve petitioner's notice of appeal, 
record on appeal, and appeal bond filed simultaneously on February 14, 
1956.</p></blockquote>
<p>The factual background of the petition may be briefly stated as follows:</p>
<p>In Special Proceeding No. 11259 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
entitled Testate Estate; of Vicente Sotto, the petitioner posted Executor's Bond 
PU No. 1310, dated July 11, 1950, in the sum of P10,000, in behalf of Executor 
Tagakotta Sotto and "for the benefit of the heirs, legatees or creditors" of the 
deceased Vicente Sotto. Tagakotta Sotto failed to perform his duties as such 
executor and, by court's order dated April 19, 1955, he was relieved of his 
trust, and in his stead Plaridel Sotto was appointed administrator of said 
estate.</p>
<p>Prior to the aforementioned date, viz., on November 24, 1954, December, 1954, 
January 31, 1955, February 1, 1955, March 31, 1955, and June 15, 1955, Tagakotta 
Sotto was ordered to render his account, but failed to do so; hence on June 23, 
1955, Quitillana Sanson, one of the claimants, filed a motion against him for 
contempt of court, praying at the same time that the bond posted by the herein 
petitioner be confiscated and disposed of in accordance with Sec. 2 of Rule 32 
of the Rules of Court. At the hearing of this motion, Atty. Heraclio Abistado 
appeared for the executor, stating that the latter was in New York, and prayed 
that said executor be given an opportunity to submit the accounting called for 
in the order of the court of April 14, 1955. On July 20, 1955, the court granted 
the motion and gave Tagakotta Sotto time, up to August 15, 1955, to submit the 
required accounting, with warning that should he fail to do so, "the bond filed 
by him would be automatically confiscated." Despite this order, the executor did 
not submit his accounts, so on <u>August</u> <u>20</u>, <u>1955</u>, the lower court entered the 
following order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appearing that the former executor Tagakotta Sotto has failed to submit 
the accounting called for in the order of April 14, 1955 on August 15, 1955, and 
in consonance with the order of July 20, 1955,</p>
<p>"The bond filed by said former executor Tagakotta Sotto (PU No. 1810) is 
hereby ordered <u>confiscated</u>.</p>
<p>"The motion filed by counsel for said former executor on August 15, 1955) is 
hereby denied.</p>
<p>"Let the Pacific Union Insurance Company be notified of this 
order."</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner herein was notified of this order on August 23, 1955. On September 
14, 1955. petitioner filed a motion praying that the order of August 20 be 
lifted and that it be given opportunity to be heard in connection with the 
motion of August 20 for confiscation or forfeiture of the bond of P10,000 and to 
contact Tagakotta Sotto to make him comply with the orders of the court 
requiring him to file his account of administration. Acting upon this petition, 
on September 17, 1955, the court gave the petitioner herein 30 days from receipt 
of the order to cause "the submission by the former executor Tagakotta Sotto of 
the accounting called for in the order of April 14, 1955 as supplemented by the 
order of July 20, 1955." On September 21, 1955, petitioner was notified of this 
order, but it failed to cause the submission of the accounting, so on <u>October</u> <u>
31</u>, <u>1955</u>, the court issued a <u>writ</u> <u>of</u> <u>execution</u> of the bond which was confiscated 
by virtue of the order of August 20, 1955. Upon being notified of this order on 
November 4, petitioner herein, instead of filing a notice of appeal, asked the 
court on November 25, 1955, that "the writ of execution be lifted or at least <u>
suspended</u> and that another extension of time of 30 days be granted to give <u>the 
movant an opportunity to finally cause the submission by former executor 
Tagakotta Sotto of his accounts.</u>" The court denied this motion on <u>December</u> <u>6</u>, <u>
1955</u>, for not being well taken, of which petitioner was notified on <u>December</u> 
<u>9</u>, <u>1955</u>. </p>
<p>On January 7, 1956, petitioner herein filed a motion to annul the orders of 
July 20, August 20, October 31 and December 6, 1955, on the ground that -</p>
<ol><li>The movant Surety Company can not be held liable under its executor's bond 
unless an action against said undertaking is instituted against the surety and 
the principal;<br>
</li><li>No writ of execution may issue against the surety's bond when its liability 
thereunder has not been previously determined by this Honorable Court by proper 
accounting, wherein the surety should be allowed to intervene;<br>
</li><li>The proper remedy is removal of executor when he fails to render an 
accounting of his administration, and not confiscation of his bond; </li></ol>
<p>contending that said orders were null and void, leaving been issued by the 
court without jurisdiction and without basis in law, for without an action 
previously filed against the executor or administrator wherein his liability and 
that of the petitioner under the administration bond in question has been 
determined, the bond can not be confiscated or executed, and therefore the order 
of July 20, 1955 declaring the bond in question as automatically confiscated, as 
well as the order of August 20, 1955 confiscating the bond, were illegal, null 
and void. This motion was denied by the lower court on January 14, and the 
petitioner has been notified thereof on <u>January</u> <u>17</u>, <u>1956</u>. Thereupon, on February 
15, 1956, petitioner filed notice of appeal, record on appeal and appeal bond, 
praying that the appeal be given due course.</p>
<p>On March 14, 1956, the respondent Judge dismissed the appeal on the ground 
that the notice of appeal, record on appeal and appeal bond "have been filed not 
within the reglementary period allowed by law,"</p>
<p>It is vigorously contended by the petitioner that the appeal was filed within 
the time allowed by law because it was presented 28 days immediately after it 
was notified on January 17, 1956 of the court's order dated January 14, 1955; 
but it appears that from the orders of August 20, 1955, October 31, 1955 and 
December 6, 1955 no appeal was filed by the petitioner except the Record on 
Appeal presented only on <u>February</u> <u>14</u>, <u>1956</u>, when the 30 days prescribed by law 
for perfecting an appeal had already elapsed. Again, petitioner contends that 
the respondent Judge denied its motion of January 17, 1956 on the only ground 
that nit was not well founded" and not because the previous orders of 
confiscation and execution of the executor's bond in question, viz., (orders of 
July 20, 1955, August 20, 1955, October 31, 1955 and December 6, 1955) had 
already become final and executory; but it is a fact that at the time of the 
filing of the notice of appeal, appeal bond and record oa appeal which were 
rejected by the lower court, the aforesaid orders were already final and 
executory.</p>
<p>Anent petitioner's contention that the orders of confiscation and execution 
of the bond in question were null and void for having been issued by the lower 
court without or in excess of jurisdiction and without basis.in law, for no 
confiscation and execution of said bond can be ordered without the liability of 
the petitioner and the executor thereunder having been previously determined in 
a separate action, we find it untenable for as ruled in Cosme de Mendoza vs. 
Pacheco and Cordero, 64 Phil. 136 -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is clear that a Court of First Instance, exercising probate jurisdiction, 
is empowered to require the filing of the administrator's bond, to fix the 
amount thereof, <u>and to hold it accountable for any breach of the administrator's 
duty</u>. Possessed as it is, with an " all-embracing power over the administrator's 
bond and over administration proceedings, a Court of First Instance in a 
probate proceeding <u>can not be devoid of legal authority to execute and make that bond answerable for the very purpose for which it was filed</u>. It is true that the 
law does not say expressly or in so many words that such court has power to 
execute the bond of an administrator, but by necessary and logical implication, 
the power is there as eloquently as if it were phrased in unequivocal terms. 
When the accountability of an administrator's bond is spoken of in the very 
provisions dealing with and bearing directly on administration proceedings, it 
would involve a strained construction to hold, as appellants would have us do, <u>
that were an administrator is held liable for a devastavit for having squandered 
and misapplied property which he was in duty bound to marshall and conserve, the 
estate is without a remedy to against the administrator' s bond in the same 
probate proceeding, but in an action outside of and separate 
from it</u>."<br></p></blockquote>
<p>It is undeniable that a bond posted in behalf of an executor or administrator "is conditioned on the latter's rendering a true and just account of his 
administration to the court within one year, and at any other time when required 
by the court" (par. c, Sec. 1, Rule 62, Rules of Court). Consequently, upon 
failure of the herein executor Tagakotta Sotto to render the accounts required 
by the disputed orders, the bond in question may be held liable for such 
failure, and accordingly ordered confiscated executed. It should be noted that 
the court below ordered the confiscation and execution of the bond in,question 
after the herein petitioner had been given opportunity to cause the submission 
by executor Sotto of his accounting and upon failure of the latter to submit it, 
so that it could not be said that the court below issued the order of 
confiscation and the writ of execution without giving the herein petitioner its 
day in court to be heard in connection therewith.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is undisputed that on January 7, 1955 when the petitioner filed 
its motion to annul the aforesaid orders dated July 20, 1955, August 20, 1955, 
October 31, 1955, these orders were already final and executory and beyond the 
jurisdiction of the court below, and therefore said motion to annul could no 
longer be entertained by the court because of lack of jurisdiction, and it was 
properly overruled. Accordingly, we hold that petitioner's appeal from the order 
of the lower court dated January 14, 1955 denying the aforesaid motion to annul 
dated January 7, 1955, was not well taken and was correctly rejected by the 
court.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition under consideration is hereby denied, with costs 
against the petitioner.<br><i><br>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A.,
