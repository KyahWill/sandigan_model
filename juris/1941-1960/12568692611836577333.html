				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal taken by Alejandro Briones, Delfin Bumanlag, Elias
Nana, Crescencia Pabiling and Victoriano Tabliga from a decision of the
Court of First Instance of La Union convicting them, together with
other seven (7) defendants, of the crime of rebellion. The first two
(2) appellants (Briones and Bumanlag) were further convicted of
multiple murder and murder, respectively. Inasmuch as defendants Nana,
Pabiling and Tabliga were subsequently allowed to withdraw their
appeal, the only matter left for determination is the appeal taken by
Briones and Bumanlag. Insofar as pertinent to them, the dispositive
part of the decision appealed from reads:<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In view of the foregoing, and finding the accused guilty of the crime of rebellion, the Court hereby sentences:</p>
  <p align="center">*	*	*	*	*	*	*</p>
  <p>"11.
Delfin Bumanlag alias Commander Delfin, in pursuance of paragraph 1 of
Article 135, Revised Penal Code, to ten (10) years of <em>prision mayor</em> and to pay a fine of P10,000, with proportionate costs;</p>
  <p>"12. Alejandro Briones alias Florante, in pursuance of paragraph 1 of Article 135, Revised Penal Code, to ten (10) years of <em>prision mayor</em> and to pay a fine of P20,000, with proportionate costs.</p>
  <p>"The Court also finds Delfin Bumanlatr and Alejandro Briones guilty of the murder of Emilio Dayao and sentences each of them to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of Emilio Dayao in the amount of P6,000, with proportionate costs.</p>
  <p>"The
Court also finds Alejandro Briones guilty of the murders of Desiderio
Ordinario, Alfredo Lacsamana and Bonifacio Nariz. For the murder of
Desiderio Ordinario, the Court sentences him to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to indemnify the heirs of Desiderio Ordinario in the amount of P6,000 with costs, for the murder of Alfredo Lacsamana, to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of Alfredo Lacsamana in the amount of P6,000, with costs; for the murder of Bonifacio Nariz, to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of Bonifacio Nariz in the amount of P6,000, with costs.</p>
  <p>"All accused are entitled to one-half of their preventive imprisonment they have already undergone."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Appellants do not question the judgment against them for simple
rebellion. They merely impugn their additional conviction for multiple
murder and murder, upon the theory that these offenses form part of,
and are absorbed by, said crime of rebellion, as held in People <em>vs</em>. Hernandez, 52 Off. Gaz., 4612. The prosecution in turn, cites, in support of the decision appealed from, the case of People <em>vs</em>.
Romagosa, 103 Phil., 20, 56 Off. Gaz. (14) 2946 in which this Court, by
the vote of six (6) members thereof, with four (4) members dissenting,
and one (1) member concurring in part and dissenting partly, held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"As in the Geronimo case, there is the further
question of whether, in view of appellant's plea of guilty to the
information, he should be deemed to have admitted the commission of the
simple crime of rebellion alone, or of rebellion and other separate
crimes, if any of the counts of the information charges crimes
independent of and not constituting essential acts or ingredients of
the rebellion charged. As already stated, the three counts of the
information against herein appellant Romagosa are exactly the same as
the last three of the five counts charged against Federico Geronimo
(100 Phil., 90). As ruled by the majority in the preceding case, the
first count under the present information (the third count against
Geronimo) does not charge appellant's participation and can not,
therefore, be taken into consideration in this case; the second (the
fourth count against Geronimo) alleges an essential act of rebellion
and is absorbed by that crime; while the third (the fifth count against
Geronimo) charges the murder of one Policarpio Tibay, a barrio
lieutenant, which killing, though committed within the jurisdiction of
the lower court, does not appear to be related to the rebellion and
hence constitutes an independent offense in itself.</p>
  <p>"The same
majority of six justices of this Court maintain their view expressed in
the Geronimo case that by his plea of guilty, appellant has admitted
the commission of the independent crime of murder alleged in count 3 of
the information, the averment that said crime was perpetrated 'in
furtherance' of the rebellion being a mere conclusion and not a bar to
appellant's conviction and punishment for said offense, appellant
having failed, at the arraignment, to object to the information on the
ground of multiplicity of crimes charged. Therefore, appellant must be
held guilty, and sentenced for the commission, of two separate
offenses, simple rebellion and murder."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted, however, that the allegation to the effect that
the acts with which Romagosa stood charged were perpetrated in
furtherance of the rebellion, was made <em>solely</em> in the <em>opening</em>
paragraph of the information. The pertinent counts thereof did not
state that the acts therein set forth were committed either in
furtherance of the rebellion or as a necessary means to commit such
crime. In the words of the majority of this Court, the specification
involved in the Romagosa case "<em>does not appear to be related to the rebellion and hence constitutes an independent offense in itself</em>."</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, the information in the case at bar alleges, <em>not only</em> in its opening paragraph, but, also, <em>in each specific count</em>,
that the acts therein charged were committed in furtherance of the
rebellion. The counts for multiple murder and murder involved herein
were couched in the following language:</p>
<p align="center">XIII</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about April 22, 1951, in the barrio of Sinapangan, Bangar, La Union, the said accused <em>in furtherance of their purpose aforesaid</em>,
conspired and confederating together and with the aid of an
undetermined number of Huks, did then and there kidnap Desiderio
Ordinario, Alfredo Lacsamana and Bonifacio Nariz from their homes and
afterwards killed and murdered these persons kidnapped;" (italics
supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">XV</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about May 9, 1951, in Barrio Lon-oy, San Gabriel, La Union, the said accused <em>in furtherance of their purpose above-stated</em>,
conspiring and confederating together and with the aid of an
undetermined number of Huks led by the accused Delfin Bumanlag alias
Commander Delfin, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously and with evident premeditation kidnap Emilio Caslangan
alias Emilia Dayao from his home, then qualified, appointed and acting
as Barrio Lieutenant of Lon-oy who has not since then returned or
appeared alive as he was murdered by the Huks." (Underscoring supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, the doctrine laid down in the Romagosa case is not in point.
Moreover, the record shows that Desiderio Ordinario, Alfredo Lacsamana
and Bonifacio Nariz were possessors of shotguns; that when Lacsamana
and Nariz were kidnapped, in the evening of April 22, 1951, <em>they were performing guard duty</em>
upon orders of the barrio lieutenant, seemingly, to maintain peace and
order in the locality and to forestall any disturbance that the Huks
may cause therein; and that, when the Huks entered the house of
Ordinario, that same evening, they found his shotgun leaning by the
wall, apparently in readiness for use should the Huks show up.
Accordingly, the Solicitor General agrees, with the defense, that
Ordinario, Lacsamana and Nariz were kidnapped and possibly killed as a
means to commit the crime of rebellion or in furtherance thereof.</p>
<p>As regards the kidnapping of Emilio Dayao, there is nothing in the
record to indicate that appellant Bumanlag had any personal motive to
harbor ill-feelings towards him. What is more Dayao was, at the time of
his kidnapping, acting barrio lieutenant. Thus being responsible for
the maintenance of peace and order in the place of his residence, it is
not unlikely that the Huks considered him as their enemy or a threat to
their existence or to the accomplishment of their objectiveâ€”the
rebellion. This is borne out by the fact that, according to the
fifteenth specification in the information, the acts alleged therein
were committed by the defendants herein, not only "in furtherance" of
the crime of rebellion, but, also, after "<em>conspiring and confederating together and with the aid of an undetermined number of Huks</em>
led by the accused Delfin Bumanlag." Hence, we are not prepared to
hold, beyond reasonable doubt, that the kidnapping of Dayao was
independent of, or unrelated to the crime of simple rebellion, of which
he has been convicted.</p>
<p>Lastly, the specific allegation, in each count of the information
herein, to the effect that the acts described in such count were
performed in furtherance of the conspiracy to commit rebellion, was
evidently made to forestall a possible motion to quash, upon the ground
of multiplicity of crimes charged in said information, as held in
People <em>vs</em>. Geronimo (100 Phil., 90, 53 Off. Gaz., 68) and People <em>vs</em>. Romagosa (<em>supra</em>).
In other words, the information is so drafted as to necessarily convey,
to a person of average intelligence, the impression that the accused
were meant to be charged, and are actually charged, with a series of
acts constituting a single offense. Hence, appellants' conviction for
murder and multiple murder, as crimes independent of that of rebellion,
violates their constitutional right to be "informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation" against them (Tubb <em>vs</em>. People 101, Phil., 114, 53, Off. Gaz., 6096), and constitutes a denial of due process.</p>
<p>Wherefore, with the elimination of the judgment of conviction for
the kidnapping of Dayao, Ordinario, Lacsamana and Nariz, as independent
and separate offenses, and of the additional penalties therefor, the
decision appealed from, insofar as it finds Briones and Bumanlag guilty
of simple rebellion and sentences them accordingly, is hereby affirmed,
without special pronouncement as to the costs in this instance. It is
so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia, Barrera,</em> and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ., </em>concur.<br><br>

     <em>DISSENTING OPINION </em>
    
 </div>
<p><strong>PADILLA, J.:</strong>
</p>
<p>For the same reasons stated in my opinion in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Geronimo, 53 Off. Gaz. 68, 92, and People <em>vs</em>.
Romagosa, 103 Phil., 20, 56 Off. Gaz., (14), 2946, the judgment
appealed from, insofar as it finds the defendants guilty of murder and
kidnapping and metes out to them the penalty provided by law, should be
affirmed; or the penalty for the complex crime of rebellion with murder
and kidnapping should be imposed.</p></div>
