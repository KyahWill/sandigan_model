				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are two appeals interposed by the&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; Severo Arce, and Anastacia Feria, from&nbsp; the decisions of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Zambales,&nbsp; in Civil Cases Nos. 1666 and 1690, dismissing, in the first case, the spouses' complaint for annulment of the deed of sale&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exh. A, and Exh. 3) conveying to their daughter Emperatriz&nbsp; Arce, one rice thresher and a&nbsp; tractor both described in&nbsp; the complaint,&nbsp; and&nbsp; likewise&nbsp; dismissing, in&nbsp; the second&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the spouses petition for injunction to restrain&nbsp; the sale of the same thresher and tractor by the deputy provincial&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; of Zambales in&nbsp; virtue of the extrajudicial foreclosure of the&nbsp; chattel&nbsp; mortgage executed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Emperatriz Arce in favor of the appellee Genoveva B. Ballesteros&nbsp; as security for&nbsp; the payment of&nbsp; a loan of P10,000.00, with interest and attorney's fees in case of default.&nbsp; Both cases were submitted and decided on the&nbsp; same evidence presented by both parties. There being but&nbsp; one sole pivotal issue in these two appeals, which is the validity of the deed&nbsp; of sale (Exh. A. and Exh. 3) sustained by the lower court in both cases, these appeals will be disposed of in this single decision. <br><br>The deed of sale sought to be&nbsp; annulled dated September 3, 1953, m a duly notarized document, registered in the Office&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Register of Deeds of Zambales,&nbsp; wherein&nbsp; it appears that Severo Arce and Roque de Jesus, father and brother-in-law respectively of Emperatriz Arce, had sold, ceded, transferred and&nbsp; conveyed to the latter, in&nbsp; consideration of the sum of P20,000.00 paid in&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; receipt whereof was&nbsp; acknowledged and&nbsp; confessed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned rice thresher and tractor which, it was declared, had been acquired by the vendors from one Marcial Feria as evidenced by another&nbsp; public document (Exh. 1).. Upon the strength of this&nbsp; deed, Emperatriz Arce, on February 9, 1954, obtained a loan in the sum of P10,000.00&nbsp; from appellee Genoveva Ballesteros<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and on the&nbsp; same date executed a chattel mortgage which was later duly registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds&nbsp; of Manila and with the Register of Deeds of Zambales.&nbsp; The mortgagor having failed&nbsp; to settle&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; loan on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1954, the due date, the mortgagee took steps to foreclose the same by having the deputy provincial sheriff of Zambales publish the sale in public auction of the mortgaged thresher and tractor.<br><br>Upon learning this, appellants filed their&nbsp; action on July 31, 1954 for annulment&nbsp; of the sale on the alleged ground of lack of consideration, it being alleged that the P20,000.00 mentioned&nbsp; in the deed of sale had not in fact been paid. The defendant Emperatriz Arce&nbsp; did not appear or answer the complaint, for which reason the plaintiffs&nbsp; petitioned and obtained&nbsp; on August 27, 1954, an order&nbsp; declaring her in default. . <br><br>After&nbsp; reception of plaintiffs' evidence by the Clerk&nbsp; of Court who was authorized for the&nbsp; purpose, and the submission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Clerk's&nbsp; report to the&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter, observing that the deed of sale being&nbsp; repudiated&nbsp; was a public document duly notarized,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">motu propio</span> re-set the case for&nbsp; further hearing citing the notary public to appear in court&nbsp; for examination. <br><br>In the meantime,&nbsp; the auction sale of the&nbsp; mortgaged properties was set for December 6, 1954, and so on" December 2, 1954, appellants filed a separate action for injunction&nbsp; (in Civil Case No. 1690 of the same court) for the purpose of enjoining&nbsp; the provincial&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; and defendant&nbsp; Ballesteros&nbsp; from&nbsp; proceeding with the announced sale.&nbsp; Upon the filing of a corresponding bond, the lower court issued a preliminary writ of injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant Ballesteros seasonally&nbsp; filed answer&nbsp; setting up&nbsp; in her defense and counterclaim the same deed of sale&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of Emperatriz&nbsp; Arce&nbsp; and the&nbsp; chattel mortgage executed by the latter upon which&nbsp; the&nbsp; foreclosure proceeding&nbsp; was predicated;&nbsp; and prayed for&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal of&nbsp; the&nbsp; action instituted by the plaintiffs&nbsp; against their daughter allegedly to defraud the creditors of the latter. <br><br>Later,&nbsp; Ballesteros intervened in the annulment case (No. 1666), asserting her&nbsp; interest&nbsp; in the&nbsp; subject&nbsp; matter&nbsp; in virtue of the chattel mortgage in her favor. <br><br>After&nbsp; trial, both cases were submitted upon the same evidence&nbsp; introduced in Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1666&nbsp; which&nbsp; consisted,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the plaintiffs-appellants, solely&nbsp; in their own uncorroborated testimony&nbsp; to the effect that they were&nbsp; the owners&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; rice&nbsp; thresher;&nbsp; that Roque de Jesus had no right or interest&nbsp; therein; that Severo Arce did not&nbsp; remember having&nbsp; signed the deed on&nbsp; September 3, 1953,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; had he seen notary public&nbsp; Artemio Marañon and the&nbsp; latter's wife on the same day; that he (Severo) had not&nbsp; received the&nbsp; P20,000.00 mentioned in the document; and that they learned of the said sale&nbsp; only when the Sheriff came to get&nbsp; the rice thresher.&nbsp; They further declared that the tractor included in the sale belonged to their son Recto Arce,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The notary public and his wife, who acted as a witness to the deed of sale, both testified and&nbsp; attested to the due execution thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellee&nbsp; Ballesteros also&nbsp; testified detailing&nbsp; the circumstances attending the granting of the loan&nbsp; and the execution of the&nbsp; chattel mortgage&nbsp; in her favorr presenting in corroboration, the deed, of&nbsp; sale in favor of Seyero Arce and Roque de Jesus concerning the rice thresher; the questioned&nbsp; deed of sale of the same and the tractor to Emperatriz Arce; the first mortgage&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by Emperatriz in favor of the previous mortgagee, its&nbsp; cancellation and the&nbsp; subsequent chattel&nbsp; mortgage in her&nbsp; (Ballesteros) own favor,&nbsp; all&nbsp; of which are&nbsp; public documents and, except&nbsp; the first&nbsp; deed of sale&nbsp; to&nbsp; Severo and Roque,&nbsp; duly registered in the corresponding Registers of Deeds. <br><br>Upon this evidence, the lower court, as heretofore stated, rendered its decisions dismissing both complaints.&nbsp; Hence, these appeals.&nbsp; <br><br>Appellants&nbsp; in this instance charge&nbsp; the lower court,-of having&nbsp; abused its discretion in re-setting&nbsp; or re-hearing the case <span style="font-style: italic;">motu propio </span>without lifting its previous, order declaring defendant Emperatriz&nbsp; Arce in default and without&nbsp; giving&nbsp; her an&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; heard;&nbsp; in&nbsp; denying their motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; new trial&nbsp; and, consequently, upholding the validity of the disputed deed of sale.&nbsp; There is no merit in this contention.&nbsp; <br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; elementary that&nbsp; trial courts, before&nbsp; rendering judgment, have&nbsp; full control of the&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; before them and,&nbsp; as judges of&nbsp; Courts of&nbsp; First Instance are judges of both fact&nbsp; and law,&nbsp; if after hearing all the&nbsp; evidence adduced by the attorneys, the court is not satisfied, he may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, on his own motion and in furtherance of justice call additional witnessed or recall some of&nbsp; the same witnesses, for the purpose of questioning them himself in&nbsp; order to satisfy his mind with, reference to particular facts or issues involved in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; This is more so where the&nbsp; defendant is in default and not in a, position&nbsp; to controvert or scrutinize the evidence of the plaintiff.&nbsp; And the opening of a case for the reception&nbsp; of further&nbsp; evidence, before any judgment has been entered therein, is not the granting of a new trial as&nbsp; would require a formal motion by any of the parties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>&nbsp;On the other hand the evidence appellants desire to introduce in the new trial requested by&nbsp; them after rendition of the judgment, is an admission by Emperatriz Arce that the contract was actually&nbsp; simulated and&nbsp; without&nbsp; consideration, as appearing in the&nbsp; affidavit dated November 5, 1955&nbsp; which was&nbsp; attached to plaintiffs' motion&nbsp; for new trial.&nbsp; The trial court acted correctly in denying the motion, for certainly this kind of evidence cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered as newly discovered under&nbsp; Rule 37 of the. Rules of Court.&nbsp; For&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of securing a&nbsp; new trial, evidence may be considered newly discovered only if it satisfies the following requisites: (1)&nbsp; that&nbsp; such evidence has&nbsp; been discovered after trial;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that&nbsp; it could not have been discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; and (3)&nbsp; that if presented, It would probably&nbsp; alter the&nbsp; result&nbsp; (1&nbsp; Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, pp. 510-511, 1957 ed., citing Bersabal <i>vs.</i> Bernal, 13 Phil., 463).<br><br>&nbsp;It cannot rightly be claimed in&nbsp; the instant cases that appellants obtained knowledge of&nbsp; the information Emperatriz Arce intended to give at the new trial, i.e., the contract's lack of consideration, only after, the original hearing or only when such affidavit was executed.&nbsp; Precisely, the action for annulment was based on that ground.&nbsp; Logically, appellants should know, and in&nbsp; fact&nbsp; it was so alleged in the complaint,&nbsp; that Emperatriz, in whose favor the contract was&nbsp; drawn, herself&nbsp; caused or at least&nbsp; was aware of such deficiency.&nbsp; To sustain their claim, therefore, they should have presented Emperatriz Arce during the hearing to testify on this point or obtained an admission from her&nbsp; under the Rules. <br><br>Appellants, however, claim that as the defendant in&nbsp; that case did&nbsp; not file an answer, they were not in a position to know what&nbsp; averments of the complaint were admitted or would&nbsp; be admitted by the said defendant.&nbsp; This contention is beside the point and&nbsp; does not&nbsp; justify their&nbsp; dispensing with the basic available evidence&nbsp; in support of their&nbsp; allegation.&nbsp; The defendant's failure to file an answer or her having been declared in default does not necessarily insure the plaintiff's obtaining the remedy prayed-for in the complaint; it is also essential for said plaintiffs&nbsp; to&nbsp; adduce evidence&nbsp; in support of their contentions (Sideco <i>vs.</i> Sande, 91 Phil., 159.) <br><br>Similarly,&nbsp; it cannot be argued that, as the defendant in the annulment case, it would be difficult if not impossible for appellants to secure the testimony&nbsp; of Emperatriz Arce to sustain their&nbsp; (appellants) case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; hostility of&nbsp; a witness does not exempt the party that should have offered his (the&nbsp; witness)&nbsp; testimony from complying with&nbsp; the requirements of Rule 37.&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstances that a&nbsp; person, known to be hostile to the movant, has decided after trial to break his silence and&nbsp; put an end&nbsp; to his hostility, did not make the testimony of such witness "newly discovered" for the&nbsp; reason that "the failure of&nbsp; applicant to inqure what a person&nbsp; supposed to have knowledge of a matter in controversy knew&nbsp; about&nbsp; it or to call or examine him as a witness is&nbsp; not .excused ordinarily by&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that their relations were unfriendly, or that the&nbsp; witness was believed to be hostile".&nbsp;&nbsp; (Moran's Comments on&nbsp; the Rules of Court, p. 511, 1957 ed.; Tek (Joan <i>vs.</i> Azores, 76 Phil., 363.)&nbsp; The facts to be testified to by defendant, which were existing&nbsp; before and during&nbsp; the trial, and which plaintiffs-appellants could&nbsp; have presented at the hearing, cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; newly discovered&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo, </span>therefore, acted correctly in denying the motion for new trial and, in accordance with the evidence obtaining&nbsp; in the case,&nbsp; in sustaining&nbsp; the validity of the sale. <br><br>Appellants, likewise, urge the annulment of the deed of sale, at least insofar as ½ of the rice thresher is&nbsp; concerned, on&nbsp; the allegation that it being a conjugal property and appellant&nbsp; Anastacia Feria not having&nbsp; consented to the sale, said contract is null and void as far as her interest is affected.&nbsp; Suffice it&nbsp; to note that other than appellants' declarations, the&nbsp; records disclose no evidence to support this contention.&nbsp; Contrarily, the intervenor's Exhibit 1, which was duly admitted by appellants, shows that the aforementioned rice thresher was purchased&nbsp; by Severo Arce, married&nbsp; to Anastacia&nbsp; Feria, and Roque&nbsp; de Jesus, married to Mercedes Arce, from Marcial Feria&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sum of P10,000.00 on December 15,&nbsp; 1948, which document even belies their contention that Roque has no interest or right therein.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the&nbsp; ruling of the lower court must perforce be upheld. <br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the conclusions thus arrived at, there&nbsp; is no need to pass upon the other questions raised by appellants.&nbsp; Wherefore, the decisions appealed from are hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against appellants&nbsp; in&nbsp; both cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Paras, C.
