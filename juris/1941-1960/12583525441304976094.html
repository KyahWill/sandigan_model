				<H3>CONFEDERATED SONS OF LABOR, PETITIONER, VS. ANAKAN LUMBER COMPANY, UNITED WORKERS' UNION AND COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an unfair labor practice case instituted at the instance of
the Confederated Sons of Labor against the Anakan Lumber Company and
the United Workers' Union, hereafter referred to as the petitioner, the
company and respondent union, respectively. The amended complaint filed
with the Court of Industrial Relations charged said respondents with
unfair labor practices committed by<p></p>
<p>A. Anakan  Lumber Company—</p>
<ol><ol><li>"by dominating, assisting and
interfering with the administration of the respondent United Workers'
Union and by contributing financial aid and other support to it, * * *.<br>
          <br>
        </li><li>"in
discriminating in regards to hire or tenure of employment for the
purpose of encouraging membership in the respondent United Workers'
Union and/or discouraging membership in the complainant Confederated
Sons of Labor or because of union membership or activity by dismissing
and in fact did dismiss without cause all its workers affiliated with
the complainant union and replaced by hew ones, * * *."</li></ol></ol>


<p>B.  United Workers' Union—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"in causing the respondent Anakan Company to
discriminate against the workers mentioned in Paragraph IV of the
foregoing complaint in violation of Section 4(<em>a</em>), subparagraph
4 of the Act by demanding from the respondent Anakan Lumber Company the
dismissal of said workers from their work therein, or in discriminating
against them to whom membership in the respondent United Workers' Union
have been terminated on grounds other than the usual terms and
conditions of membership made available to other members by expelling
them as members from the said Union in violation of the respondent
union's Constitution and By-laws and who were subsequently dismissed by
the respondent Anakan Lumber Company oh demand by the respondent United
Workers' Union, in violation of Section 4(b), sub-paragraph 2 of
Republic Act No. 875."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On motion of petitioner and with the conformity of respondents, the
Court of Industrial Relations issued, in the course of the trial, an
order dismissing the charge of union domination against the company.
Subsequently, upon submission of the case for decision on the merits,
the presiding judge of said court issued an order, dated October 4,
1956, absolving respondent union, but finding the company guilty of
unfair labor practices in dismissing 46 employees thereof, and
ordering" said company "to cease and desist from engaging in unfair
labor practice and to reinstate the 46 employees concerned, with back
wages from the date of their separation from its service until
reinstated." On motion for reconsideration filed by respondents, a
majority of the members of the court, sitting <em>in banc</em>,
reversed said order and dismissed the complaint, in a resolution dated
December 28, 1956. Hence, this petition for review by certiorari filed
by petitioner herein.</p>
<p>It appears that respondent union has a membership of more than 1,000
laborers and employees of the company, with whom it entered, on January
23, 1955, into a contract entitled "Collective Bargaining and Closed
Shop Agreement". Subsequently, 46 employees of the company and members
of respondent union joined petitioner herein, which is another labor
organization. As a consequence, said 46 employees were expelled from
respondent union, pursuant to its constitution and by-laws. Thereafter,
respondent union demanded from the company the dismissal of these 46
employees, upon the authority of Article II of said "Collective
Bargaining and Closed Shop Agreement", and claiming to act in pursuance
of such Article II and in compliance with the aforementioned agreement,
the company dismissed said 46 employees. Inasmuch as they are members
of petitioner herein, the latter caused this unfair labor practice
proceedings to be instituted.</p>
<p>The main issue in the case at bar is whether the company was bound
to expel the aforementioned 46 employees under the provisions of said
Article II of its collective bargaining agreement with respondent union
reading:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the UNION shall have the exclusive right, and
privilege to supply the company with such laborers, employees and
workers as are necessary in the logging, mechanical, sawmill, office,
logponds, motor pools, security guards and all departments in its many
phases of operations, excepting such positions which are highly
technical and confidential in character and/or such positions which
carry the exercise of authority in the interest of the COMPANY which
exercise is not merely clerical or routinary within the contemplation
of the law, and that the company agrees to employ or hire in any of its
departments only such person or persons who are members of the UNION."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondents maintain that since respondent union is thus given "the <em>exclusive</em>
right and privilege to supply the company with such laborers, employees
and workers as are necessary" for the activities specified in said
Article II and the company had agreed "to employ or hire in any of its
departments <em>only</em> such persons who are members of the union",
it follows that such laborers, employees and workers of the company as
may, cease to be members of the respondent union must be expelled from
the company. Upon mature deliberation, the Court is of the opinion that
respondents' pretense cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>At the outset, respondents labor evidently under the impression that
said Article II of their contract establishes a "closed shop"
agreement, which is erroneous for, as held by this Court.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>" 'Closed-Shop agreement is  an agreement whereby an employer binds himself to hire only members of the  contracting union <em>who must  continue to  remain members in good standing  to keep their job.</em>' "  (National  Labor Union <em>vs.</em> Aguinaldo's Echague, Inc.,  51 Off. Gaz. No.  6, p.  2899,  cited in Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. and Alfredo T. Garcia <em>vs.</em> National Employees-Workers  Security Union, 53 Off. Gat.,  615; Italics ours.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rothenberg, in his work on tabor Relations, has the following to say about "closed shop":</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"A 'closed shop' may be denned as an enterprise in
which, by agreement between the employer and his employees or their
representatives, no person may be employed in any or certain agreed
departments of the enterprise unless he or she is, becomes, and,<em> for the duration of the agreement, remains a member in good standing</em>
of a union entirely comprised of or of which the employees in interest
are a part." (Rothenberg on Labor Relations, p. 48; Italics ours.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as Article II above quoted does not provide that employees
"must continue to remain members in good standing" of respondent union
"to <em>keep</em> their jobs," the collective bargain-agreement
between them does not establish a 'closed shop," except in a very
limited sense, namely, that the laborers, employees and workers engaged
by the company after the signing of the agreement on January 23, 1955,
must be members of respondent union. The agreement does not affect the
right of the company to retain those already working therefor on or
before said date, or those hired or employed subsequently thereto,
while they were members of respondent union, but who, thereafter,
resign or are expelled therefrom.</p>
<p>In order that an employer may be deemed bound, under a collective
bargaining agreement, to dismiss employees for non-union membership,
the stipulation to this effect must be so clear and unequivocal as to
leave no room for doubt thereon. An undertaking of this nature is so
harsh that it must be strictly construed, and doubts must be resolved
against the existence of "closed shop". Referring particularly to the
above-quoted Article II, we note that the same establishes the
exclusive right of respondent union to "supply" laborers etc., and
limits the authority of the company to "employ or hire" them. In other
words, it requires that the laborers, employees and workers hired or
employed by the company be members of respondent union at the time of
the commencement of the employer-employee relation. Membership in
respondent union is not a condition for the <em>continuation</em> of said relation or for the <em>retention</em> of a laborer or employee engaged either before said agreement or while he was a member of  said union.</p>
<p>Indeed, Article III—<em>a </em>of the agreement provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the COMPANY may dismiss or otherwise remove
from employments any employee or laborer for gross inefficiency,
misconduct, gross disrespect to the manager, misbehavior, or culpable
negligence in the office, commission of any crime or misdemeanor while
in the course of his employment or work or office, only upon report of
the same in writing duly signed by the supervisor or company official
directly responsible over such employee or laborer to the Manager of
the company which report shall contain in concise form the facts and
circumstances upon which such removal or dismissal is based, furnishing
therewith in the form of notice the President of the UNION within 3
days before such dismissal or removal is effected, the latter upon
receipt thereof shall give his consent or dissent thereto in writing,
which in case of dissent shall be considered a formal request for
reconsideration of the cause of each individual case or removal or
dismissal by the COMPANY."</p>
</blockquote>
  <p> If the parties to the agreement intended to
establish a "closed shop", in the strict sense of the phrase, they
would have inserted in said Article III-<em>a</em>, among the grounds
for dismissal by the company therein specified the discontinuance of
membership in respondent union. Their failure to make such insertion
strongly indicates that said discontinuance of membership was riot
understood to be a ground for dismissal.</p>

<p>Further confirmation of this view  is  the fact that on August 24, 1965, or <em>after</em>
the dismissal of all of the employees above mentioned—except one who
was dismissed on August 30, 1955—Article II of the agreement was
amended to read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the UNION shall have the exclusive right and
privilege to supply the COMPANY with such skilled and/or unskilled
laborers, employees and workers as are necessary in the logging,
mechanical, sawmill, office, log ponds, motor pool, security guards and
all departments in its many phases of operation whether on. an
apprenticeship or temporary status, excepting such positions which are
highly technical and confidential in character and/or such positions
which carry the exercise of authority in the interest of the COMPANY
which exercise is not merely clerical or routinary within the
contemplation of the law, and that the COMPANY agrees to comply or hire
in any of its department only such person or persons who are members of
the union and to retain in its employ only such employees or laborers
who remain members of good standing of the Union; subject to the
following limitations or conditions, to wit:</p>
  <ol><li> An apprentice shall, after serving 78 working days,  be  automatically classified as temporary employee or laborer.<br>
      <br>
    </li><li> A temporary employee becomes automatically  permanent and regular after working 152 working days."</li></ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The addition, to the last part of the original Article II, of the clause "and<em> to  retain</em> in its employ only such employees or laborers who <em>remain</em>
members of good standing of the union," indicates that the company was
not prohibited prior thereto from retaining in its employ such
laborer's as do not remain members of good standing of respondent union.</p>
<p>In short, the dismissal of 45 out of the 46 laborers in question,
prior to said amendment of Article II, was illegal and, hence, said 45.
laborers should,, be reinstated. Considering, however, that the
agreement was entitled "Closed Shop" and that there is no local
decision squarely in point, the Court is inclined to give the company
the benefit of doubt as regards its claim that it acted under the
honest belief that it was bound to dismiss them pursuant to said
agreement.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is hereby reversed, insofar
only as the aforementioned 45 laborers, and employees are concerned,
and another one shall be entered directing the reinstatement of said 45
laborers and employees, with costs s against the respondents. It is so
ordered</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C.  J.,  Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</em> and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur.<br>
  <em>Barrera, J</em>., reserves his vote.
