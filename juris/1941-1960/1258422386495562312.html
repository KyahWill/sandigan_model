The conviction must stand.&nbsp; The&nbsp; records&nbsp; disclose that at the arraignment, the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; were&nbsp; assisted by a counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de&nbsp; oficio</span> appointed by the presiding Judge.&nbsp; Counsel was given time to confer and did confer with the defendants before entering their plea of guilty.&nbsp; There appears to be no doubt that: their plea were given voluntarily and spontaneously.&nbsp; Under these facts, no irregularity was committed by the lower court.<br><br>New counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> in this review, however, contends that it was error for the lower court to consider against the accused the aggravating as well as the qualifying circumstances stated in the information, there having been no hearing ordered by the said court to at least investigate the facts that were alleged as giving rise to those circumstances.<br><br>In several cases, this Court had occasion to rule that a plea of guilty removes all the necessity of presenting evidence of the crime charged and is sufficient to sustain a conviction, even a c<span style="font-style: italic;">apital, offense,</span> without any further evidence (People<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>. Acosta, 52 Off. Gaz. 1930; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Rapirap, G. R. No. L-110001, January 21, 1958), the requisite proofs having been supplied by the accused himself. By the plea of guilty, all the facts alleged in the information are deemed admitted (People vs. Lambino, G. R. Ho. L-10875, April 28, 1958).&nbsp; The taking of further evidence, including the ascertainment of circumstances which affect criminal&nbsp; liability, rests entirely upon the sound discretion of the court&nbsp; (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Trimpo, G. R. No. L-8585, October 23, 1956, 52 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; No.15, 6514; People vs. Acosta, supra) .&nbsp; Thus, in the Acosta case, this Court said: <br><blockquote>This Court&nbsp; has already declared that the essence of the plea of guilty&nbsp; in a criminal trial is that the accused, on arraignment, admits his guilt freely, voluntarily and with full knowledge of the&nbsp; consequences&nbsp; and meaning of his act,&nbsp; and with a clear understanding&nbsp; of the&nbsp; precise nature of the crime charged in the&nbsp; information;&nbsp; that when formally&nbsp; entered, such a plea&nbsp; is&nbsp; sufficient to&nbsp; sustain a conviction of any offense charged in the information, even a capital offense,&nbsp; without the&nbsp; introduction of further evidence, the defendant having himself supplied the necessary proof;&nbsp; and that while it&nbsp; may be&nbsp; prudent and advisable in some cases, especially where&nbsp; grave crimes are charged, to take additional evidence as to&nbsp; the guilt of the accused and the circumstances attendant&nbsp; upon the commission of the crime, nevertheless it lies&nbsp; in the sound discretion of the court&nbsp; whether to&nbsp; take&nbsp; evidence or not in any case where it is&nbsp; satisfied that the plea of guilty has been&nbsp; entered by the&nbsp; accused with full&nbsp; knowledge of the meaning and consequences of his act. (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Jamad, 37 Phil.&nbsp; 305; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Burlado,&nbsp; 42 Phil.&nbsp; 72;&nbsp; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Santa Rosa, G. R. No.&nbsp; L-3487,&nbsp; April 18,&nbsp; 1951;&nbsp; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Sabilul,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-3765,&nbsp; June 21,&nbsp; 1951). (52 Off. Gaz. No. 4, p. 1932)<br></blockquote>The aggravating circumstances&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case mostly appear from official&nbsp; records, and it must&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; for this reason that counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> in the court below did not ask the court for inquiry into the circumstances&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime, but assented-into their entering a. plea of guilty&nbsp; notwithstanding the serious consequences that said plea entailed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, no attempt was made, after the passing of the death sentence, to ask the court to&nbsp; reopen the hearing for reception of evidence in defense or mitigation of liability, evidently because no&nbsp; such evidence existed. It is well to note that even discarding the circumstances of premeditation and cruelty, sufficient aggravating circumstances remain, not only to offset the plea of guilty but to raise the penalty to the maximum provided by law,&nbsp; specially in view of Art. 160 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>He find no error in the judgment appealed from and, much to our regret, find no alternative but to affirm the judgment and&nbsp; sentence now under review.<br><br>So Ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.<br></div>
