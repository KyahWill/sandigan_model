				<H3>ERLINDA ESTOPA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LORETO PUNSAY, JR.,  DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal fromthe decision of the Negros Occidental court , of first injjfjfnce awarding to plaintiff  the sum of P5,000.00 by way of moral damages, P2,000.00 as exemplary damages and P1,000.00 as attorney's fees.</p>
<p>As stated  by the court below, "this is  an action for recovery of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.  There  is no dispute regarding the facts of this case. The plaintiff Erlinda Estopa, a beautiful girl of  twenty-three,  residing in  Bago, Negros  Occidental,  with  her widowed mother, Felicidad Estopa, stated that she fell in love and  submitted herself  completely to  the defendant Loreto Piansay, Jr., sometime in September, 1957, after a courtship that lasted for a couple of months during which period the defendant consistently promised  and  succeeded to make her believe in him that he was going to marry her; that sometime in December, 1957, the plaintiff was informed reliably that defendant was backing out from his promise  of   marriage  so  she  demanded  defendant's compliance to his promise in order to vindicate her honor, and plaintiff went to the extent of asking  the  help of defendant's parents, but all her efforts  were in vain. Finally, realizing that her efforts were  futile but knowing that her cause was not completely lost, she decided to fifef her complaint, not to compel defendant to marry her, bill" to demand from him a compensation for the damages that she sustained."</p>
<p>There is no  claim for any other kind of damages.  In fact, Erlinda Estopa filed no brief here.  And her complaint merely  alleged "social  humiliation,   mental anguish, be smirched reputation, wounded feelings  and  moral shock."</p>
<p>We have today decided that in this  jurisdiction, under the New Civil Code, the mere breach of a promise to marry is not actionable.   (Hermosisima <em>vs</em>. Court of  Appeals, <em>Supra</em>,  631);  and we have reversed  the  Cebu  court's award for moral damages in  a breach of  promise suit. Consistently with such  ruling, Loreto Piansay,  Jr. may, not be condemned to pay moral  damages, in this case.</p>
<p>Now, as plaintiff has  no right to moral  damages, she may not demand exemplary damages.   (She lays no claim to temperate or compensatory damages.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"While the amount of the exemplary damages need not be proved, the plaintiff must show that he is entitled to moral, temperate or compensatory damages <em>before the  court may consider</em> the question of whether or not exemplary damages should be awarded.  (Art. 2234, New Civil Code.)  (Italics supplied.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, as plaintiff is not entitled to any damages at all, there  is no  reason to  require Piansay,  Jr. to satisfy attorney's fees.</p>
<p>Judgment reversed, defendant absolved from all liability. No costs.</p>
<p><em>Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, </em>and <em>Paredes, JJ, </em>concur.</p>
