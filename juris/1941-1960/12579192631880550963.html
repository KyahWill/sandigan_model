				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this original action, petitioners Prudential Bank &amp; Trust 
Company—hereafter referred to as the Bank—and Sixto L. Orosa, Jr., pray for: (1) 
a writ of certiorari "annulling and/or setting aside the decision" of the Court 
of Industrial Relations, in Case No. 1106-ULP thereof, entitled "National Labor 
Union and Jose M. Señir <em>vs</em>. Prudential Bank &amp; Trust Co., and Sixto 
Orosa, Jr.," the dispositive part of which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the complainants and 
against the respondents, finding the latter guilty of the unfair labor practice 
complained of. Consequently, respondents are ordered to cease and desist from 
further committing said unfair labor practice and they are likewise ordered to 
reinstate complainant Jose M. Senir to his former position with back salary, at 
the rate of P215.00 a month, from October 31, 1956 up to the time of his actual 
reinstatement and under the same terms and conditions prior to his separation 
from the service."</p></blockquote>
<p>"as without or in excess of jurisdiction and/or abuse of discretion"; and (2) 
a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining said court, as well as the National 
Labor Union and Jose M. Señir, from executing the aforementioned decision. Upon 
the filing of a bond in the sum of P500.00, the writ of preliminary injunction 
prayed for was issued. </p>
<p>Jose M. Señir, the main respondent herein, was acting chief of the security 
guard section of the Bank up to October 31, 1956, when he was dismissed from the 
service. Soon thereafter, at the instance of Señir and the National Labor Union, 
of which Señir is a member, an acting prosecutor of the Court of Industrial 
Relations filed therewith a complaint for unfair labor practice—which was 
docketed as Case No. 1106-ULP—against said Bank and its Vice-President and 
General Manager, Sixto Orosa, Jr., who had allegedly dismissed Señir because of 
his union activities. The Bank and Orosa filed an answer denying the charge of 
unfair labor practice and alleging that Senir had been dismissed, not owing to 
his union activities, but for cause, as found by a special committee that had 
investigated some charges preferred against him by one Pablo M. Ignacio. 
Replying thereto Señir alleged, in turn, that said committee had been 
irregularly created by the management and had deprived him of the right to be 
represented by counsel, as well as of the opportunity to prove his defense.</p>
<p>When the case was heard in the Court of Industrial Relations, Señir testified 
that he was a member of the National Labor Union and, up to October 31, 1956, 
acting chief of the security guards of the Bank, which dismissed him for no 
other cause than his union activities, inasmuch as, prior to said date, he had 
initiated the formation of a labor union other than that already existing among 
the employees of the Bank, and was working for better terms and conditions of 
employment for its security guards, as indicated by the fact that, during a 
conference he had, in relation thereto, with the general manager of the Bank, 
Mr. Sixto Orosa, Jr., the latter said: "I was informed that you were the one 
agitating for the formation of a labor union here."</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, testifying for the respondents therein—petitioners 
herein—said Mr. Orosa stated that the dismissal of Senir had been due, not to 
his alleged union activities, which were unknown to him (Orosa), but to a just 
cause, as found by the committee above referred to. In support of this 
testimony, the Bank and Mr. Orosa introduced, also, as part of their evidence: 
an undated complaint of Pablo M. Ignacio, a security guard of the Bank, charging 
Señir with dereliction of duty, disrespect to superior officers, inciting 
discontent and unbecoming conduct; Señir's answer thereto; the record of the 
investigation conducted by said committee; its original report recommending 
either Señir's demotion or his resignation; and a subsequent communication of 
the committee recommending his dismissal.</p>
<p>In due course, the Court of Industrial Relations rendered the decision 
complained of, finding that respondent Señir was a member of the Prudential Bank 
&amp; Trust Co. Employees Association, which had a collective bargaining 
agreement with the Bank, effective for a period of three (3) years, from 
December 20, 1954; that paragraph (9) of said agreement provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That there shall be created a Personnel Committee composed of 
representatives of the Bank and the Association which shall be in charge of 
settling any dispute, controversy or problem that may arise between the Bank and 
the members of the Association. Any dispute or controversy which cannot be 
settled by the Personnel Committee shall be referred to an impartial arbitrator 
to be chosen by both the Bank and the Association. The decision of the 
Arbitrator shall be final between the parties."</p></blockquote>
<p>that the special committee—created by the Bank and consisting of four (4) 
Representatives of the management and one (1) representative of the 
Association—that investigated the charges of Ignacio against Señir, was not 
constituted in conformity with the provisions of said paragraph (9) of the 
aforementioned collective bargaining agreement, which was in force at that time; 
that Señir had asked that he be allowed to be represented by counsel in the 
investigation conducted by said committee, but the same denied said request; 
that upon the filing of Senir's written answer to the charges of Ignacio, the 
committee considered the investigation concluded and then rendered its report 
and recommendation, without giving Señir an opportunity to introduce evidence in 
support of his aforesaid answer. Then the decision of respondent court goes on 
to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After having carefully considered the respective contentions of both parties 
in this case on the collateral question at issue, together with its impressions 
on the investigations conducted by the Special Investigating Committee on the 
charges filed against complainant Señir (after painstaking review of its 
proceedings as recorded in Exhibit '9'), the Court is more inclined to give 
credit to the contention of the complainants and, therefore, believes that the 
proceedings end recommendations conducted and arrived at by said committee, 
respectively, on the charges in question should be, as they are hereby 
considered null arfd void. Consequently, all the actions by respondents taken 
thereafter and pursuant thereto are likewise invalidated.</p>
<p>"While efficient and productive operations of any establishment requires that 
management be in a position to take reasonable disciplinary action against 
erring employees, care should be taken " to make it clear that it (management) 
does not disregard its obligations and commitments under a contract it has 
entered into with the representatives of its employees. Toward that end, it is 
well to agree with said representatives upon the common reasons for discharge of 
employees. For to disregard such procedure has the effect of throwing into 
discard the basic purposes of the contract and to a large extent reduces to 
futility the painstaking and time-consuming effort to establish orderly 
procedures through collective bargaining negotiations. It is the duty of both 
management and labor to see that the relief demanded does not violate or 
undermine these basic standards for 'administration of the grievance procedure 
involves matters which afffect the daily lives of employees in relation to their 
job.'</p>
<p>'* * * An adequate and proper functioning grievance procedure can serve as a 
means of becoming aware of employee complaints which require attention and 
elimination of their causes. Thereby, better labor relations may be attained and 
the companies' policies and rules guard to more efficient operation to the 
extent that they may be accommodated to employee needs.' (pages 327 and 348— The 
Law of Labor Relations—Werne.)</p>
<p>"On the other hand, and coming to complainant Señir's claim that his 
dismissal was due to his union activities and to his determined efforts to see 
the working conditions of the security guards under him improved, the Court has 
noted that although his testimony to that effect has never been corroborated by 
any other witness—he being the only witness for the complainants— said 
contention found support from Pablo M. Ignacio himself. In paragraph 4 of the 
charge (Exhibit '4') he (Ignacio) filed against Señir, it was alleged:</p>
<p>'A week later, he called for a meeting and his statement was this: I'll see 
to it that you all guards be given an extra pay for Sundays, and 25 percent to 
50 percent for those guards working in the night shift. Our answer was this: 
That we are given an increase yearly, including the Christmas bonus and profit 
sharing. It is embarrassing for us to take other privileges, because it is given 
to us without asking for it. He insisted that we have to fight for our 
privileges, but our answer was still no. We will not do that because we don't 
want to be possessive. After we were not convinced at the meeting it was 
adjourned and within two minutes we were called again, he said, suppose that the 
management will cut off the one day off in every week, and uniforms and shoes. 
Our answer was this: That we are much higher than those guards of the agencies.' 
The several witnesses presented during the investigation of said charges by the 
Special Investigating Committee have likewise made reference, in the course of 
their testimony (Exhibit '9'), to the efforts made by complainant Senir to the 
end that their working conditions would improve.</p>
<p>"In the light of the foregoing facts and observations, the Court is of the 
opinion that complainant Jose M. Senir's contention that the only reason why he 
was dismissed by respondent on October 31, 1956 was his union activities is more 
tenable."</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the question for determination by respondent court was whether or not 
Señir's dismissal had been due to his union activities. Señir maintained the 
affirmative and testified to this effect. Upon the other hand, petitioners 
herein—respondents in the unfair labor practice case—introduced Orosa's 
testimony in support of the negative view, and presented, by way of 
corroboration, the records of the proceedings in the special committee above 
referred to. The Presiding Judge of the Court of Industrial Relations held, in 
the decision complained of, not only, that the committee had been irregularly 
constituted by the Bank, in violation of its collective bargaining agreement 
with the labor organization of which Señir was a member, but, also, that the 
proceedings in said committee were fatally defective, for lack of due process. 
What is more, respondent court found that Senir's testimony, concerning his 
activities to improve the conditions of employment of the security guards had 
been borne out by the evidence introduced before said committee, and by the very 
complaint filed against him by security guard Ignacio—who appears to harbor 
ill-feelings toward Señir and was administratively convicted of, and punished 
for, insubordination to him, as his superior officer. For these reasons, said 
court, thru its Presiding Judge, rendered its decision adopting the version of 
Señir and giving no credence to the theory of petitioners herein. Subsequently, 
the court <em>en banc</em> unanimously affirmed said decision (although two [2] 
members of the court concurred merely in the result).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note, at this juncture, that petitioners herein have not 
denied the irregularity in the organization of the special committee above 
mentioned, or even tried to justify it. Neither have they attempted to justify 
the denial of said committee of Señir's request to be represented by counsel, or 
its failure to give an opportunity to introduce evidence in his own behalf. 
Thus, the issue before us narrows down to whether or not respondent court 
exceeded its jurisdiction, or so gravely abused its discretion as to have 
exceeded its jurisdiction, in concluding, under the circumstances already 
adverted to, that the testimony of Jose M. Señir deserves more credence than 
that of Sixto L. Orosa, Jr. It is obvious that this question must be decided in 
the negative, regardless of the alleged demerits of said conclusion, which was 
made in the valid exercise of the jurisdiction of respondent court (Herrera vs. 
Barretto, et al., 25 Phil., 245-251) and constituted, at most, a mere error of 
judgment, which cannot be reviewed or set aside by writ of certiorari (So Chu 
<em>vs</em>. Nepomuceno, 29 Phil., 208; De los Santos <em>vs</em>. Mapa, 46 
Phil., 791; Gonzales <em>vs</em>. Salas, 49 Phil., 1; Ello <em>vs</em>. Judge of 
First Instance, 49 Phil., 152; Santos <em>vs</em>. Court of First Instance, 49 
Phil., 398; Ong Sit <em>vs</em>. Piccio, 78 Phil., 785; Castro <em>vs</em>. 
Peña, 80 Phil., 488; Gil <em>vs</em>. Gil, 80 Phil., 791).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is dismissed, the writ of certiorari therein prayed 
for is denied and the writ of preliminary injunction heretofor issued hereby 
dissolved, with costs against petitioners herein. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition dismissed.</em></p></div>
