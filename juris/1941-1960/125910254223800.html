				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from the judgment of the Court  of First Instance of Cebu in Criminal Case No. V-6076,  finding accused-appellants Sergio Arranchado, Jose Tuico and Miguel Arriesgado, guilty of murder for the killing of Revilioso Ygot, and sentencing each and every one of them to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify  the heirs of the  deceased victim, jointly and Severally, in the sum of P5,000.00, and to pay 3/4 of the costs.</p>
<p>On July 11,  1957,  herein accused-appellants  and Marceliano Arranchado were charged with the crime of  homicide before the Justice of the Peace of Daanbantayan,  Cebu, in connection with the death  of Revilioso Ygot.  The accused having waived their right to a preliminary investigation, the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance. On August 30, 1957, the information was amended to one of murder, with an allegation that the  commission of the crime was. qualified by evident premeditation and treachery.  Upon arraignment,  Marceliano Arranchado  alone pleaded guilty to  the offense charged and was, accordingly, sentenced ahead of the others to from five (5) years, five (5)  months and  eleven  (11)  days of <em>prision correccional</em> to twelve  (12) years, five (5) months and eleven  (11) days <em>of prision</em> mayor; to imdemnify the heirs  of the victim in the sum of P5,000.00; and to pay % of the costs.  The court then ordered the case tried as to the  remaining accused, appellants  herein.</p>
<p>The evidence is clear  to  the effect that at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon  of July 10, 1957, Leon  Buangjug and Revilioso Ygot  were  together in  the  latter's house located in barrio  Talisay, Daanbantayan.   At about 5:30 p.m., the two friends left the place and proceeded in the direction of barrio Suba, Daanbantayan.  They parted ways after Buangjug reached  home, and Revilioso proceeded to the house of one Bonif acia Pepito.  Less than half an hour later and while Buangjug was about ready to eat his supper, he heard Revilioso shout, "Leon, I was beaten by Iyok, Jose and Miguel  (referring to the three  appellants) and then I was stabbed by Marsing (Marceliano Arranchado)." Thereupon, Buangjug hurriedly came down from his house and followed Revilioso, who was then running to get home. Revilioso, however, was only able to run the distance up to Pablo Pepito's place, where he  fell; whereupon, Tiburcio Arranchado and Abdon Petalita carried him to the Ygots' residence.   When  his father, Sergio Ygot, inquired about what happened, Revilioso declared that he was beaten up by Jose, Iyok and  Miguel and stabbed by  Marsing, adding, "Father, I  think  I will die." </p>
<p>Later, Revilioso was taken to the town proper (Daan-bantayan)  for  medical  treatment, where the  municipal health officer, Dr.  Augusto M. Lucero, administered first-aid to stop the bleeding from the stab wound; but seeing that the patient was about to die, the doctor urged his folks to bring him to the city.   Upon arrival  there, however, Revilioso expired.</p>
<p>Doctor Lucero issued a medical certificate as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>"This is to certify  that Revilioso Ygot, of Barrio Talisay, Daan-bantayan, Cebu, was treated by the undersigned at 8:00 p.m.  July 10,  1957, for the following injuries:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Stab wound, about one inch in width and penetrating the whole thickness of the left dorsolateral thorasic wall  at the level of the 9th rib.  The wound was clean cut and with sharp edges and directed downwards and centrally into adjoining left lung tissues producing a condition  of  "sucking pneumothorax".</li>
  <li> Contusions were  also  found over the following  parts  of the body:</li>

<p>a)  Behind  the right ear</p>
<p>b) Upper portion of  the right  back</p>
<p>c)  Left scapular region</p>
<p>d) Part of the back immediately  below the  left scapular region</p>
<p>e)  Left shoulder  around the acromial region.</p>
<li> The victim on arrival was dying and bleeding profusely  both from the wound and  from the mouth.
</li><li> Death was, therefore, caused by  the severe blood loss."</li></ol></blockquote>
<p>The only eyewitness  to  the  attack was Pablo  Petaleta. He testified that while on his  way home after fetching water from a well located at the boundary of barrios Suba and Talisay, Daanbantayan,  he saw Sergio Arranchado, Miguel Arriesgado  and Jose Tuico  delivering blows  to Revilioso with pieces of wood until the latter crumpled down  on his knees.  While  Revilioso  was  still  in  that position,  Marceliano Arranchado  suddenly appeared,  "I don't know where he came from", and stabbed the victim with a dagger.</p>
<p>The medical  certificate issued by Dr.  Lucero, indicating the nature and location of the wounds  inflicted upon Revilioso, corroborates  in significant  details  the  statements of Pablo Petaleta on how  the crime was  perpetrated by the  attackers.</p>
<p>In the face of the deceased victim's  dying declaration, testified to by Leon Buangjug and Sergio Ygot, and of the attestations of  the eyewitness Pablo Petaleta, all of whom were found to  be worthy of credit by the  trial court, the evidence for the defense, that consists of mere denials, dan not prevail {see People <em>vs</em>. Villanueva,  104 Phil.,  450; 56 Off.  Gaz. [5] 923).</p>
<p>There remains the issue regarding appellants'  liability. It is evident that the prosecution  failed to prove  conspiracy between  the three accused-appellants and  Marceliano Arranchado.  Even the State's  evidence tends  to establish that it was only after the deceased was assaulted by the appellants that Marceliano Arranchado appeared and  stabbed the victim; and thereafter,  it does not appear that the appellants continued  their attack on the deceased. Additionally, both the ante mortem  statement  of  the deceased  and the testimony of the  sole eyewitness clearly indicate that the intervention of Marceliano was  distinct and  separate.  The  medical certificate  issued by  the attending physician, on the other hand, gave as the sole cause of death the severe loss of blood on account of the  stab wound.  That  the  contusions inflicted  upon the victim were not fatal was testified to by the same  doctor.  Under the circumstances, appellants may not  be held guilty as co-since they did not take part in the killing itself, nor did they induce  Marceliano to commit the same, nor did they cooperate in the commission  of the offense by another act without which it would not have  been accomplished.   (Art. 17, Revised Penal Code).</p>
<p>Neither may appellants be held guilty as accomplices to the murder  under  Article 18 of  the Revised Penal Code for the reason that it was not proved that they knew of the criminal  design of the principal  culprit  (Marceliano)  at the time they were inflicting blows upon the deceased  {see People <em>vs</em>. Tamayo, 44  Phil.,  38 and authorities cited therein).  The suddenness  of the attack by Marceliano in  fact excludes  any question of their cooperating in his homicidal attack (see U. S. <em>vs</em>. Reyes  and Javier, 14 Phil., 27, 30).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It  is an essential condition to the existence of complicity, not only that there should be a relation between the acts done by the principal and those attributed to the person charged as accomplice, but is furthermore necessary that the latter, <em>with knowledge of the. criminal intent,</em> should cooperate with the intention of  supplying material or moral aid in the execution of the crime in an  efficacious way."   (TS, May 23, 1905; Viada, 5 Supp., 169; TS, June 28,  1901 Viada, 4 Supp., 196, quoted in Peo. <em>vs</em>. Tamayo, supra, p. 49).  Italics supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crime, therefore, committed by the appellants is only that of slight physical injuries punishable under paragraph 2 of Article  266 of the Revised Penal Code, since there is no proof as to the period of .the offended party's incapacity for labor or of the required medical attendance  (People <em>vs</em>. Penesa, 46 Off. Gaz., Supp. 1, pp. 180, et seq.).  The offense was aggravated  by abuse of superior strength; the trial court, however, correctly disregarded the attendance of evident premeditation.</p>
<p>Accordingly,  this Court finds all three appellants guilty of slight  physical  injuries penalized by  the second paragraph of Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code, committed with the aggravating circumstance of  having taken advantage of superior strength, without any  mitigating circumstance.  We, therefore,  modify  the sentence imposed by the Court below upon appellants, reducing it to 30 days imprisonment  plus the accessory penalties prescribed  by law; and appellants to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Revilioso  Ygot, jointly and  severally, for  the  injuries caused by them, in the sum of P1,000..No  costs in this instance.</p>
