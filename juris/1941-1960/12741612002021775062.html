				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Petition to review a decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, petitioners 
being respondents in the case decided against them by said court.<p></p>
<p>Lucia vda. de Tinio was the owner of an <u>hacienda</u> in barrio Bantug, Licab, 
Nueva Ecija with 8 tenants (the respondents herein). The <u>hacienda</u> having been 
leased by her to one of the petitioners herein Eduardo Joson, then mayor of the 
municipality of Quezon in that same province, the latter some time in 1950, 
acting through his overseer Candido Cruz, a lieutenant of his civilian guards, 
ejected old tenants from the land and put in their stead his co-petitioners here 
in, who were then members of his civilian guards. For fear of Mayor Joson and 
his civilian guards, the ousted tenants did not then report the matter to the 
authorities. But in the early part of 1954, having heard Judge Arsenio Roldan of 
the Court of Industrial Relations declare in conferences held in that province, 
that tenants who had been unlawfully ejected from their landholdings had the 
right to be reinstated, the old tenants, on March 4, 1954, filed a petition in 
the Court of Industrial Relations asking that they be reinstated. Made 
respondents in that petition were the landowner Lucia vda. de Tinio and her 
lessee Eduardo Joson, But the petition was amended to include as respondents the 
other petitioners herein and also to have one of the petitioners, who had 
already died, substituted by his widow.</p>
<p>Answering the complaint, the landowner admitted having leased the land in 
1949 to Mayor Joson and that, in that same agricultural year, Joson put his men 
on the land in place of the old tenants. And affirming that she had nothing to 
do with the ejectment, she manifested that as the lease had already expired she 
was willing to iiave the old tenants reinstated if the new occupants would 
vacate the premises.</p>
<p>Joson's men, the new occupants, answered, claiming that the old tenants were 
dismissed with cause and also invoking prescription as a special defense.</p>
<p>Joson did not answer the petition although in one of the hearings he 
manifested in open court that he had never leased the land from its owner and 
could, therefore, not have ejected the landowner's old tenants.<br><br>The case 
having been transferred to the Court of Agrarian Relations, that court, after 
considering the evidence, rendered its decision, the dispositive part of which 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF AIL THE FOREGOING, respondents Macario Pineda, Felix Mesina, 
Domingo Mesina, Procopio Calison, Rolando Vicente, Dominador Pineda and 
Florentino Floras, the present occupants of the landholdings of petitioners 
Bienvenido Lapug, Silvino Jaime, Isaias Madriega, Benjamin de la Merced, 
Gertrudo Rimando, Valentin Domingo and Francisco Jacinto located at barrio 
Bantug, Licab, Nueva Ecija, are ordered to vacate the same effective at the 
close of the agricultural year 1955-56 but in no case later than April 30, 
1956,</p>
<p>"Thereafter, respondent Lucia vda. de Tinio is directed to reinstate said 
petitioners in their respective landholdings with all the rights recorded and 
the obligations imposed by law, except petitioner Isaias Madriaga, now deceased, 
when she may replace with another tenant of her choice, preference to be given 
to the wife and children of the deceased, if physically capable of farm 
work.</p>
<p>"The petitioners' reinstatement shall be without prejudice to their filing of 
claim for damages against respondent Eduardo Joson by virtue of their unlawful 
ejectment."</p></blockquote>
<p>Not satisfied with the decision, the respondents below, with the exception of 
the landowner, brought the case here for review, alleging that the court below 
erred:</p>
<ol><li>In ordering the petitioners herein to vacate the land-holdings before 
decisions has become final and conclusive;<br><br>
</li><li>In ordering the petitioners to vacate landholdings before the decision has 
become final and conclusive without requiring the posting of bonds from the 
respondent;<br><br>
</li><li>In giving preferential right to the wife and children of a deceased tenant 
over that of a tenant who is in actual possession in good faith;<br><br>
</li><li>In reinstating the respondents to the land-holdings without obtaining the 
prior consent of their present landholders and without terminating their tenancy 
relations with such landholder for just cause;<br><br>
</li><li>In not holding that the respondents have abandoned their landholdings and 
are not entitled to reinstatement.<br><br>
</li><li>In ejecting the petitioners herein without just and lawful cause in 
accordance with law in stead of imposing fine or damages on the erring land 
holder;<br><br>
</li><li>In its finding that petitioner Eduardo Joson was the lessee of the 
landholding;<br><br>
</li><li>In not holding that Candido Cruz was the lessee of the lands and Eduardo 
Joson was only a guarantor; and<br><br>
</li><li>In holding that the respondents were unlawfully ejected and that they 
maintained silence for fear of reprisal. </li></ol>
<p>After going over the record, we find no reason for disturbing the following 
findings of fact of the lower court (1) that following the lease of the land to 
Mayor Joson, the latter, through a lieutenant of his civilian guards, ousted the 
old tenants from the land, which they had been cultivating for not less than 16 
years,and installed in their place his civilian guards; (2) that the ouster was 
without lawful cause and against the will of the ousted; and (3) that if they 
did not report the matter at once to the authorities, it was because they were 
afraid of Mayor Joson and his civilian guards. This disposes of alleged errors 
Nos. 5, 7, 8 and 9.</p>
<p>Under section 50 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act, a tenant cannot be 
dispossessed except for causes enumerated therein. With the exception of 
abandonment, none of those causes is invoked, and wilful abandonment is not to 
be deduced from the way the old tenants were ejected in this case.</p>
<p>Having been illegally deprived of their landholdings,the old tenants had a 
right to be reinstated. But it is contended that the new occupants are 
themselves tenants, not mere intruders, and they cannot be ejected before the 
decision in the case has become final and without the old tenants filing a bond. 
But the law requires no such bond and, as the trial court has found - and we 
think correctly -the new occupants "are, in legal contemplation, not tenants at 
all, since they entered upon the landholding under illegal circumstances and 
from indications, were even privy with the respondent Eduardo Joson in the 
illegal and summary ejectment of tenant-petitioners." This disposes of alleged 
errors Nos. 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In connection with the 3rd specification of errors, the petitioners claim 
that the court had no authority to require the landholder to choose from among 
the heirs of the decease tenant Isaias Madriaga the one to succeed him in the 
land-holding on the theory that under section 9 of the Agricultural Tenancy Act, 
the heirs of a deceased tenant have the right to continue working only up to the 
close of the agricultural year in which their predecessor in interest died. But 
the landholder did not appeal from this ruling, for she is not a party to the 
present petition, while, on the other hand, in the answer filed by her in the 
court below she manifested her willingness to reinstate her old tenants since 
her lease to Mayor Joson had already expired.</p>
<p>In connection with the 4th specification of error, petitioners claim that 
three of the herein respondents are now tenants of another landowner, Macaria 
Tinio de Domingo, and to reinstate them in their former landholdings 
without Macaria Tinio's consent, is contrary to section 24, paragraph 1 
of the Agricultural Tenancy Act. This, however, should not be any concern of the 
herein petitioners. On the other hand, no showing has been made that Macaria 
Tinio de Domingo is opposed to the reinstatement of these three respondents. 
Moreover, the law does not prohibit a tenant from cultivating two or more 
landholdings so long as the total area of these does not exceed five hectares, 
and there is no showing in this case that the holdings of these three 
respondents would exceed that area if they were restored to their former 
holdings.</p>
<p>As to alleged error No. 6, sentencing herein petitioners merely to pay 
damages instead of making them vacate the land to give way to the old occupants 
would be contrary to the purpose of the Agricultural Tenancy Act, which is to 
give security of tenure to legitimate tenants.<br></p><p>In view of the foregoing, the decision below is affirmed with costs against 
the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia, </i>and 
<i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</p>
