				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; The appeal has been&nbsp; certified to us by the Court of Appeals as raising only a question of law.<br><br>It appears that the appellant Uy Jui Pio was charged in the municipal court of Manila with a violation of Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 142&nbsp; for using&nbsp; publicly a name different from the one with which he was christened&nbsp; or by which he&nbsp; had&nbsp; been known since childhood.&nbsp; Convicted in&nbsp; that court, he&nbsp; appealed to the Court of First Instance, where the case was submitted for decision solely upon&nbsp; the admissions made by him at the hearing.&nbsp; Those admissions&nbsp; were to the effect that he had been known since childhood "by the name of Uy Jui Pio <i>alias</i> Juanito Uy"; that he&nbsp; was also known in school&nbsp; "as Uy Jui Pio alias Juanito Uy"; that the records&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Bureau of Immigration from the year&nbsp; 1946 "would&nbsp; also bear (out) the same name of Uy Jui Pio&nbsp; alias Juanito Uy"; that "since 1936&nbsp; until the passage&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act 142", he had been using that name; and that in his marriage&nbsp; contract he signed the name "Juanito Uy" to&nbsp; conform to the name already typewritten thereon by&nbsp; someone else.<br><br>On the basis&nbsp; of the above admissions, the trial court found defendant to have violated section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 142 by adopting&nbsp; the name "Juanito Uy" "when he was already named in his own country as 'Uy Jui Pio'." The conviction cannot stand.<br><br>Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 142 reads:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. Except as a pseudonym for literary purposes, no person snail use&nbsp; any&nbsp; name different&nbsp; from the&nbsp; one&nbsp; with "which&nbsp; he was christened or by which he has been known since his childhood,&nbsp; or such&nbsp; substitute&nbsp; name as may have been authorized by a competent court.&nbsp; The name shall comprise the patronymic name&nbsp; and one&nbsp; or two surnames."</blockquote>In forbidding the&nbsp; use of a name different&nbsp; from that by which&nbsp; one has been known since childhood, this section, by necessary, implication, allows the&nbsp; use of the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant, therefore, had&nbsp; the right to use the name "Juanito Uy"&nbsp; because&nbsp; he has since childhood&nbsp; been known by that name.<br><br>It&nbsp; is contended,&nbsp; however, that the name&nbsp; "Juanito Uy" is an alias and defendant is. not authorized to&nbsp; use it without judicial authorization in view of section 2 of this Act which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 2. Any person&nbsp; desiring to use an alias&nbsp; or aliases&nbsp; shall&nbsp; apply for authority therefore in&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; like those legally provided to obtain judicial&nbsp; authority for a change&nbsp; of name.&nbsp; Separate proceedings shall be had for each&nbsp; <i>alias</i>, and&nbsp; each new petition&nbsp; shall set forth the original&nbsp; name and the&nbsp; alias or aliases for&nbsp; the use of which judicial authority has been obtained, specifying the proceedings and the date on&nbsp; which such authority was granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial authority for the use of aliases shall be recorded in&nbsp; the proper civil register."</blockquote>The&nbsp; contention&nbsp; is&nbsp; without&nbsp; merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2&nbsp; necessarily refers to&nbsp; a name whose&nbsp; use is&nbsp; not already authorised by section 1&nbsp; for, otherwise, the two&nbsp; sections would conflict with&nbsp; each other in&nbsp; that one&nbsp; forbids what the other&nbsp; allows.&nbsp; A statute should be so construed as&nbsp; to&nbsp; prevent a conflict between different parts&nbsp; of it&nbsp; (Black&nbsp; on Interpretation of Laws, 2nd ed., pp. 345-347).&nbsp; Moreover, as Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 142&nbsp; is a&nbsp; penal statute, it&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; construed strictly against the State and in favor of the accused&nbsp; (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 451).<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the appellant acquitted with&nbsp; costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de&nbsp; officio</span>.<br><br><i>Para's,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
