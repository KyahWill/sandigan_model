				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Januario Hermitano,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; grantee&nbsp; of&nbsp; original&nbsp; plaintiff Tomasa Aguilar,&nbsp; who died <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente&nbsp; lite</span>,&nbsp; seeks to recover from defendants the possession of the portions of land they are occupying, plus damages representing the value&nbsp; of the produce of the land since he acquired it to&nbsp; the time they are surrendered to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alberta Aguilar, as heir of Tomasa Aguilar, likewise&nbsp; seeks to&nbsp; recover from&nbsp; defendants damages&nbsp; representing the value of the produce of the land from 1947, when&nbsp; defendants took possession&nbsp; thereof, until it was sold to Januario Hermitano.<br><br>Plaintiff's action is based on the claim that the land in question&nbsp; originally belonged to Tomasa Aguilar to&nbsp; whom was issued Transfer Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 10499 of the land records of the province of Tarlac; that&nbsp; when Aguilar died on August 4, 1952, it was inherited by her only heir Alberta Aguilar; and that the property was later sold to Januario Hermitano,&nbsp; who is now the present owner thereof.<br><br>Defendants&nbsp; seek to&nbsp; defeat the&nbsp; action&nbsp; of plaintiffs&nbsp; by claiming that the certificate of title issued to the predecessor in&nbsp; interest of Januario&nbsp; Hermitano is&nbsp; null&nbsp; and&nbsp; void because it was issued by a court that&nbsp; had no jurisdiction over&nbsp; the land and,&nbsp; therefore, the title&nbsp; upon which&nbsp; the action of plaintiffs is based&nbsp; is also null and void.<br><br>The trial court&nbsp; overruled the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of defendants and sustained the action&nbsp; of plaintiffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; ordered defendants to vacate the portions of land occupied&nbsp; by them and to pay plaintiffs damages representing the value&nbsp; of the produce of the land since they took possession thereof in 1947 until its possession is actually surrendered to&nbsp; Januario&nbsp; Hermitano.<br><br>The facts of this case are&nbsp; not disputed.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; appear in the&nbsp; decision of the trial court&nbsp; as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"The registered land in question is the same identical property object&nbsp; of Registration Case No. 494 of this Court, G.L.R.O. Record No. 15951, filed&nbsp; in 1919, wherein&nbsp; the Director of Lands&nbsp; was the principal oppositor claiming the land as&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the public domain. The applicants therein were the spouses Simon&nbsp; Castro y Rufo&nbsp; and Tomasa&nbsp; Aguilar.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1924, this&nbsp; Court rendered&nbsp; therein&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision declaring the land in question a part&nbsp; of the public domain.&nbsp; However, on appeal&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicants, our&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court, in 1926, reversed the decision of this lot covered by Plan Psu-15730, with the exception of the Canoac Creek,&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; applicants.&nbsp; In 1927, the corresponding decree and title was&nbsp; accordingly issued to the applicants (Original Certificate of Title No. 19960— Exhibit 'A'; Records of Registration Case No. 494—Exhibit 'L').&nbsp; Said certificate of title was cancelled&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1936 and,&nbsp; in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No. 10499&nbsp; (Exhibit 'B')&nbsp; was&nbsp; duly issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name of original plaintiff Tomasa Aguilar,&nbsp; who died on August 4, 1952.&nbsp; Before she died, however, she sold pendente lite the land in question to plaintiff Januario Hermitano, and by virtue of said sale Transfer Certificate&nbsp; of Title No.&nbsp; 10499&nbsp; was cancelled and, in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No. 15763&nbsp; (Exhibit 'C') was issued in favor of Januario Hermitano&nbsp; on April 8, 1953.<br><br>"Sometime before&nbsp; the commencement of this case, the defendants had&nbsp; filed individual free patent applications&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands over several lots comprised within Plan Pls-84 (Exhibit '4') covering a big mass of land&nbsp; situated in Mangatarem, Pangasinan. The&nbsp; Bureau of&nbsp; Lands, however,&nbsp; in&nbsp; January to March,&nbsp; 1947,&nbsp; after due&nbsp; investigation and&nbsp; relocation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; registered&nbsp; property in question, ordered the exclusion from the&nbsp; respective free patent applications of the defendants (Exhibits 'E', 'E-1' to 'E-31' ) of all portions thereof that were included and comprised within pls-84 (exhibit 4 there is no question that the portions excluded by bureau lands from respective free patent applications defendants, containing a total area 419,824 square meters, more or less, are part and parcel the registered land in question, (exhibits 'D' and 'D-1' ).&nbsp; Notwithstanding aforesaid action of the Bureau of Lands, the defendants still insist that the several lots applied for by them in their respective individual free patent applications are part of the public domain.&nbsp; They also insist that the land applied for by them are actually situated&nbsp; within the municipality of Mangatarem, Province of Pangasinan, and, therefore, outside territorial jurisdiction this Court.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; this alleged fact, on which the defendants based their contention that this Court, acting as&nbsp; a land&nbsp; registration court, had no jurisdiction to decree the original registration of the land in question, because the jurisdiction of the Court proceedings is confined&nbsp; and limited only to the territorial limits this province.&nbsp; In contending that the title to the land in question was procured by the&nbsp; original registered owners in bad faith,&nbsp; the defendants claimed&nbsp; that they were not personally notified of the initial registration proceedings in the aforementioned Registration Case No. 494 and that they were misled and deceived by the pendency of another registration case filed by the applicants before the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Pangasinan over a&nbsp; bigger mass includes several now dispute.&nbsp; "<br></blockquote>Appellants claim that the&nbsp; decree&nbsp; issued in Registration Case No. 4940 of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Tarlac in 1919,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is more&nbsp; than 30&nbsp; years&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the filing of the complaint,&nbsp; adjudicating the land in question to Januario Hermitano's predecessor in interest is invalid for the reason that the court that had issued the decree had no jurisdiction&nbsp; to act on the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; In support of this claim, appellants advance the&nbsp; following reasons:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; When the petition for registration of the land in&nbsp; question was filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Tarlac&nbsp; in 1919, there&nbsp; was already pending&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Pangasinan another registration case involving a bigger portion of land which embraces certain portion of the land subject of the Tarlac&nbsp; registration case,&nbsp; it being the&nbsp; theory of applicants&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Pangasinan court&nbsp; acquired original jurisdiction&nbsp; to the exclusion of all other courts with respect to the land covered by the&nbsp; registration case;<br><br>2. Appellants or&nbsp; their predecessor in interest were not included in the notice of the initial hearing of the registration case pending in the Tarlac&nbsp; court and, therefore,&nbsp; were not&nbsp; personally notified of the proceedings&nbsp; as required by&nbsp; law; and 3. A bigger portion&nbsp; of&nbsp; land which&nbsp; one&nbsp; Antonia&nbsp; Fuster sought. to register&nbsp; in her&nbsp; name in a later registration case&nbsp; before the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Pangasinan&nbsp; and&nbsp; which happens to embrace, the portions now in&nbsp; dispute was subsequently declared public land&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court in&nbsp; G. R. No. 40129.<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; first ground has no&nbsp; merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that&nbsp; the Pangasinan court of, first instance dismissed the registration&nbsp; case originally filed by appellees when it found that the portions of the land&nbsp; covered by it which&nbsp; are now&nbsp; the subject of&nbsp; this case were actually situated within the municipality of San Clemente, province of Tarlac, and the dismissal was <i>without&nbsp; prejudice</i>.&nbsp; This dismissal has&nbsp; the effect of relinquishing the jurisdiction originally acquired by the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pangasinan&nbsp; and of transferring it to the court of&nbsp; Tarlac which is the proper court to take cognizance of the&nbsp; case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; the registration case&nbsp; in Tarlac was filed&nbsp; sometime before the dismissal of the&nbsp; Pangasinan case can have no&nbsp; legal&nbsp; adverse consequence.&nbsp; On the contrary,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; a rectification of an error committed as to venue for indeed the court that&nbsp; should "take cognizance&nbsp; of this registration&nbsp; case&nbsp; is that&nbsp; which&nbsp; has territorial jurisdiction over the&nbsp; property.<br><br>This court&nbsp; is the Court of First Instance of Tarlac.&nbsp; Thus, Section 10, Act&nbsp; No. 2347 provides&nbsp; that "all&nbsp; jurisdiction and power&nbsp; heretofore&nbsp; conferred by Act Numbered Four Hundred and Ninety-Six and&nbsp; its amendments upon the Court&nbsp; of Land&nbsp; Registration and upon the&nbsp; land registration judges, are hereby conferred upon the Courts of First Instance and judges thereof, of the provinces in which the land which is to be registered is situate."&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)<br><br>With&nbsp; regard to the second ground,&nbsp; it is true that&nbsp; appellants were not personally notified of the pendency of the present registration&nbsp; case even&nbsp; if&nbsp; they were actually occupying,&nbsp; as they claim, portions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the land, but such procedural defect cannot affect the jurisdiction of the court because&nbsp; registration proceedings have the nature of actions in rem.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Court has held time and again that lack of personal notice in a registration proceeding to persons who may claim certain right or interest in the property cannot vitiate or invalidate the decree or title issued&nbsp; therein because proceedings to register land under Act No. 496&nbsp; are <i>rem</i> and not <i>in personam</i>.<br><br><blockquote>"A land registration proceeding is in rem, and therefore the decree of registration is binding upon and conclusive against all persons including the Government and its&nbsp; branches,&nbsp; irrespective&nbsp; of whether or not they were personally notified of the filing of the application&nbsp; for registration or&nbsp; have&nbsp; appeared and filed&nbsp; an answer to said&nbsp; application, because all&nbsp; interested parties&nbsp; are&nbsp; considered as notified&nbsp; by the publication required&nbsp; by law."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sorongon <i>vs.</i> Makalintal, 80 Phil., 259: See also Roxas <i>vs.</i> Enriquez, 20 Phil., 31; Alba <i>vs.</i> Be la Cruz, 17 Phil., 49;&nbsp; Alcantara, et al. <i>vs.</i> De la Paz, et al.f&nbsp; 92&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 796; Sepagan <i>vs.</i> Dacillo, 63 Phil., 412; Castelo <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands, 48 Phil., 589.)</blockquote><br>Moreover, it appears that appellants based their right to the land merely on the applications for homestead patent they filed with the Bureau of Lands which were then under investigation when the registration&nbsp; case was filed in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Tarlac wherein the Bureau of Lands was made party respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bureau filed an opposition to the registration claiming that 4he land subject of the registration was a portion of the public domain, but&nbsp; its opposition was overruled.&nbsp; As a result, the Bureau of&nbsp; Lands&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; a&nbsp; relocation of&nbsp; the portions covered by the applications of appellants and, once relocated, they were ordered excluded from&nbsp; the land covered by the registration case.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; can therefore be&nbsp; said that appellants were already indirectly represented in the registration case by the Bureau of Lands because their interest in the land can be considered as derivative of the Bureau's claim that it belong to&nbsp; the&nbsp; public domain.<br><br>But what&nbsp; makes the&nbsp; claim of appellants legally&nbsp; futile is that they are raising the nullity&nbsp; or invalidity of the decree and title&nbsp; of appellees over the property in question after the lapse&nbsp; of&nbsp; more than&nbsp; 30 years, which certainly can not&nbsp; be done considering the purpose of our Torrens system.&nbsp; As this Court has aptly said: "When once a decree of registration is made under the Torrens system and the time has passed within which that&nbsp; decree may&nbsp; be questioned, the title is perfect and cannot later be&nbsp; questioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * The very purpose of&nbsp; the Torrens system would be destroyed if the same land may be subsequently brought under a&nbsp; second action for registration" (Reyes and Nadres <i>vs.</i> Borbon&nbsp; and&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of Lands, 50&nbsp; Phil., 791, 792).<br><blockquote>"As the land in dispute is covered&nbsp; by plaintiff's Torrens certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Title and was registered&nbsp; in 1914, the&nbsp; decree of&nbsp; registration can no longer&nbsp; be impugned&nbsp; on the ground of&nbsp; fraud, error or lack of notice to defendant, as more than one year has already elapsed from the issuance and entry of the decree.&nbsp; Neither could the decree be collaterally attacked by any person claiming title&nbsp; to, or interest&nbsp; in, the land prior to the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; proceedings. (Sorongon <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Makalintal, 45 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. 3819.)"&nbsp; (J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. <i>vs.</i> Quirino Bolaños, 95 Phil., 106).</blockquote>We also find no merit in the third ground, considering the express provision of&nbsp; Section 45 of Act No.&nbsp; 496 to the effect that land&nbsp; once registered shall&nbsp; be and always remain&nbsp; registered, title thereto becoming indefeasible&nbsp; after the lapse of&nbsp; one&nbsp; year.&nbsp;&nbsp; As this Court&nbsp; has said: "No rule is&nbsp; better settled&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; jurisdiction than the one which prohibits the changing, altering or modification of a decree in a land registration proceeding under the Torrens system after the lapse of one year" (Director of Lands <i>vs.</i> Gutierrez David, 50 Phil., 797).&nbsp; Following this ruling we may say that the inclusion, perhaps&nbsp; inadvertently, of the portion&nbsp; of land here in&nbsp; dispute in the&nbsp; Fuster case cannot have the effect of nullifying a&nbsp; decree issued in a previous registration case giving to appellants a Torrens title to the land.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; more so&nbsp; considering&nbsp; what said Section 45 provides:&nbsp; "The obtaining of a&nbsp; decree of registration&nbsp; and the entry of a certificate of title shall be regarded as an agreement running&nbsp; with the land, and binding upon&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp; and all successors in&nbsp; title that the land&nbsp; shall be and always remain&nbsp; registered&nbsp; land,&nbsp; and&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the provisions of this Act and all Acts amendatory thereof." <br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Labrador</i>, and <i>Endencia,&nbsp; JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br><i>Reyes, A.,</i> and <i>Concepcion, JJ., </i>concur in the&nbsp; result.</div>
