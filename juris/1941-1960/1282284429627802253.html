				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. EUGENIO GARCIA Y MADRIGAL, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The sole question presented on this appeal is whether the appellant, being 17 
years of age at the time of the commission of the crime, was entitled to the 
privileged mitigating circumstance of Article 68, paragraph 2, of the Revised 
Penal Code. The lower court, ignoring defendant's minority, sentenced him to an 
indeterminate penalty of from 4 years, 2 months and 1 day of <i>prision 
correccional</i> to 8 years of <em>prision mayor</em> for the crime of robbery of 
which he was found guilty. He was also sentenced to pay the offended party, 
jointly and severally with, the other accused, the sum of P85.00 as indemnity.</p>
<p>Republic Act No. 47, which amended Article 80 of the Revised Penal Code by 
reducing from 18 to 16 the age below which accused have to "be committed to the 
custody or care of a public or private, benevolent or charitable institution," 
instead of being convicted and sentenced to prision, has given rise to the 
controversy. The Solicitor General believes that the amendment by implication 
has also amended paragraph 2 of Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code, which 
provides that when the offender is over fifteen and under eighteen years of age, 
"the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law shall be imposed, but always 
in the proper period."</p>
<p>There are well recognized rules of statutory construction which are against 
the Government's contention.</p>
<p>One of these rules is that all parts of a statute are to be harmonized and 
reconciled so that effect may be given to each and every part thereof, and that 
conflicting intentions in the name statute are never to be supposed or so 
regarded, unless forced upon the court by an unambiguous language. (59 C. J., 
999.)</p>
<p>This rule applies in the construction of a statute and its amendment, both 
being read together as a whole. "An amended act is ordinarily to be construed as 
if the original statute has been repealed, and a new and independent act in. the 
amended form had been adopted in its stead; or, as frequently stated by the 
courts, so far as regards any action after the adoption of the amendment, as if 
the statute had been originally enacted in its amended form. The amendment 
becomes a, part of the original statute as if it had always been contained 
therein, unless such amendment involves the abrogation of contractual relations 
between the state and others. Where an amendment leaves certain portions of the 
original act unchanged, such portions are continued in force, with the same 
meaning and effect they had before the amendment. So where an amendatory act 
provides that an existing statute shall be amended to read as recited in the 
amendatory act, such portions of the existing law as are retained, either 
literally or substantially, are regarded as a continuation of the existing law, 
and not as a new enactment." (59 C. J., 1096, 1097.)</p>
<p>We find, no irreconcilable conflict between Article 68, paragraph 2, as it 
now stands and Article 80 as amended, There is no incompatibility between 
granting accused of the ages of 15 to 18 a privileged mitigating circumstance 
and fixing at 16 the maximum age of persons who are to be placed in a 
reformatory institution. In other words, there is no inconsistency between 
sending defendants of certain ages to prison and giving them a penalty lower 
than the imposable one on adults under the same or similar circumstances. Let it 
be remembered that the privilege of Article 68, <em>supra</em>, is not by its 
nature inherent in age but purely statutory and conventional, and that this 
privilege is granted adult offenders under given conditions.</p>
<p>At least there is no clear intention on the part of the Congress to amend 
Article 68. Indeed the rational presumption is that if there had been such an 
intention the lawmakers should have said so expressly, instead of leaving the 
change to inference.</p>
<p>One other rule of interpretation that quarrels with the theory of implied 
repeal or amendment is that penal law is to be construed, in case of doubt, 
strictly against the state. "Criminal and penal statutes must be strictly 
construed, that is, they cannot be enlarged or extended by intendment, 
implication, or by any equitable considerations . In other words, the language 
cannot be enlarged beyond the ordinary meaning of its terns in order to carry 
into effect the general purpose for which the statute was enacted. Only those 
persons, offenses, and penalties, clearly included, beyond any reasonable doubt, 
will be considered within the statute's operation. They must come clearly within 
both the spirit and the letter of the statute, and where there is any reasonable 
doubt, it must be resolved in. favor of the person accused of violating the 
statute; that is, all questions in doubt will be resolved in favor of those from 
whom the penalty is sought." (Statutory Construction, Crawford, pp. 
460-462.)</p>
<p align="left">The offense charged in the information of which the appellant was 
found guilty is punishable under Article 294, case No. 5, of the Revised Penal 
Code, as amended by Sect:ion 6 of Republic Act No. 18, with <em>prision 
correccional</em> in its maximum period to <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium 
period. The penalty one degree lower than this is <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum 
period to <em>prision correccional </em>in its medium, period. There being no 
modifying circumstance, the appropriate penalty in the present case is from 6 
months and 1 day of <em>arresto mayor</em> to 2 years and 4 months of 
<em>prision correccional</em>. Being entitled to an indeterminate penalty as 
provided in Section 1 of Act No. 4103 as amended, the accused should be, and he 
is hereby sentenced to imprisonment of not less than 4 months of <em>arresto 
mayor</em>, and not more than 2 years and 4 months of <em>prision 
correccional</em>. In all other respects the appealed judgment is affirmed., The 
appellant will pay the costs of this appeal.</p>

<p align="center">RESOLUTION ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>
<p align="right"><em>April 12, 1950</em></p>
<p align="left">TUASON, <em>J</em>.:</p>
<p align="left">This is a motion for reconsideration of our decision.</p>
<p align="left">The main theme of the Solicitor General's argument is that 
articles 13 (2) and 68 (2) of the Revised Penal Code "complement each other;" 
that "the application of article 68 takes place only when the court has to 
render judgment and impose a penalty upon a minor who has been proceeded against 
in accordance with article 80 and who has misbehaved or is found incorrigible," 
and that "article 80 must be applied first before article 68 can come into 
operation, and the court can not apply the latter article in total disregard of 
the former." In short, as we infer from this line of reasoning, what article 80 
does not touch, article 68 can not touch.</p>
<p align="left">We do not think the premise and conclusion of the motion are 
correct. There seems to be a confusion of ideas.</p>
<p align="left">It may do us well to make a brief review of the legislation, past 
and present, relative to juvenile offenders and disect and analyze its various 
provisions. This, we trust, will help us to see the true relations and the 
differences between them and the role assigned to each.</p>
<p align="left">Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"<em>Penalty to be imposed upon a person under eighteen years of 
age</em>.â€”When the offender is a minor under eighteen years and his case is one 
coming under the provisions of the paragraph next to the last of article 80 of 
this Code, the following rules shall be observed:</p>
<p align="left">"1. Upon a person under fifteen but over nine years of age, who is 
not exempted from liability by reason of the court having declared that he acted 
with discernment, a discretionary penalty shall be imposed, but always lower by 
two degrees at least than that prescribed by law for the crime which he 
committed.</p>
<p align="left">"2. Upon a person over fifteen and under fifteen and under 
eighteen years of age the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law shall 
be imposed, but always in the proper period."</p></blockquote>
<p align="left">Sub-paragraphs 1 and 2 of the foregoing article are a reproduction 
of article 85 of the Spanish Penal Code.</p>
<p align="left">Into the Revised Penal Code, the Juvenile Delinquency Act was 
incorporated. It has become in the new code article 80, the first paragraph of 
which provides that "whenever a minor under 18 years of age, of either sex, be 
accused of a crime, the court * * * shall commit such minor to the custody or 
care of a public or private, benevolent or charitable, institution, etc." And in 
the paragraph immediately preceding the last, it is further provided that "In 
case the minor fails to behave properly or to comply with the regulation of the 
institution to which he has been committed, or with the conditions imposed upon 
him when he was committed to the care of a responsible person, or in case he 
should be found incorrigible or his continued stay in such institution should be 
inadvisable, he shall be returned to the court in order that the same may render 
the judgment corresponding tot eh crime committed by him."</p>
<p align="left">The latest legislation on the subject was Republic Act No. 47, 
which amended article 80 of the Revised Penal Code so as to reduce to below 16 
the age of minors coming within its purview.</p>
<p align="left">A close examination of articles 68 and 80 will disclose that 
article 68, according to its main paragraph, is to lay off and watch while the 
minor is in the hands of a charitable institution or person mentioned in article 
80 trying to reform him or her. This has to be so because article 68 is a rule 
for the application of penalties, and there is no penalty when there is no 
judgment, and there is no judgment when the delinquent is in Welfareville or 
other place of similar character or entrusted to the care of a private person. 
However, if and when the minor turns out to be hopeless or incorrigible, he is 
returned to the proper court and the court passes sentence on him or her. In 
other words, article 80 withdraws, as it were, and sub-paragraphs 1 and 2, as 
the case may be, of article 68 takes control.</p>
<p align="left">From this it will be seen that article 68 is not dependent on 
article 80, nor do these articles complement each other if by complement is 
meant that they are two mutually completing parts so that article 68 could not 
stand without article 80. It is more appropriate to say that article 68 merely 
adjusts itself to article 80 but is, in all other respects, self-sufficient and 
independent of the latter. Parts of one system of penology and working in 
coordination with each otehr, they purse different ends. It is to be noticed 
that article 68 falls under section 2 of Chapter IV entitled "Application of 
Penalties," while article 80 comes under section 1 of Chapter V entitled 
"Execution and Service of Penalties." Two different subjects, these.</p>
<p align="left">It will also be seen that article 68, sub-paragraphs 1 and 2, and 
article 80 of the Revised Penal Code do not function at the same time and are 
designed for different purposes. Each has its assigned, separate sphere of 
action without in any way intermingling with the other. When article 80 
operates, article 68 keeps out of the way; article 68 steps in when article 80 
steps out.</p>
<p align="left">While a minor is in the process of being reformed he is, in a 
manner of speaking, in an intermediate or indeterminate state, neither in prison 
nor free. Through repentance and by observing good conduct, he is rewarded with 
freedom, released upon reaching the age of majority or before, but if he shows 
no promise of turning a new leaf, Bilibid claims him.</p>
<p align="left">It is the minors so situated; it is the selection of who should be 
committed to a reformatory school or to the custody of a private person with 
which article 80 has to do, and no more. Article 80 does not concern itself with 
what should be done with minors when they are consigned to jail because of 
misbehaviour; much less is it concerned over minors who, after the passage of 
Republic Act No. 47, are condemned to prison without having been under the 
custody of a benevolent institution or private person like youths between 16 and 
18. On the other hand, article 68 is intended for minors who rare sent to jail, 
a matter foreign to the province of article 80.</p>
<p align="left">To press the argument further, article 85 of the original Penal 
Code conferred upon minors under 18 the right to a penalty one or two degrees 
lower than the normal penalty. Then came the Juvenile Delinquency Act giving 
additional concession to juvenile delinquents. When, later, Republic Act No. 47 
amended article 80 so as to eliminate from its beneficent provisions minors of 
the age of 16 or over the under 18, the logical effect of the amendment can be 
no other than to correspondingly reduce the age of minors regarding whom the 
suspensory inhibition on article 68 is to be confined. Only to the extent and 
within the limits that article 80 applies is article 68 bound to defer to that 
article. Where article 80 does not apply, article 68 is supreme. When article 80 
says that it will deal only with minors below 16, it relinquishes authority over 
minors above that age in favor of article 68. When and if article 80 should by 
amendment further reduce the age to 15, to that extent the operation of article 
68 will be correspondingly enlarged.</p>
<p align="left">In fact, if Republic Act No. 47, instead of limiting the operation 
of article 80 to minors under 16, had totally abolished the scheme of juvenile 
reformation, sup-paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 68 of the Revised Penal Code 
would, in our opinion, remain intact, with the only difference that, as before, 
they would have full sway, unhampered by any consideration of suspended 
judgment. The predecessor of article 68 was in the original Penal Code since 
that Code was put in force in Spain in 1870 and in the Philippines in 1844, long 
before the idea embodied in article 80 was conceived. Before the Revised Penal 
Code went into effect, article 85 of the old Penal Code and the Juvenile 
Delinquency Act worked in the manner herein set forth although there was not any 
express provision coordinating their operation. It can safely be said that the 
main paragraph of article 68 was inserted merely to explain in clear and express 
terms when it should stand aloof and when it should paly its role. The Revised 
Penal Code merely states the obvious as befits a scientific system of law.</p>
<p align="left">In conclusion, when Republic Act No. 47 amended article 80 of the 
Revised Penal Code by reducing the age of persons who may be placed on probation 
under that article, the amendment did not change in any form or manner the 
degree of punishment that should be meted out to those who are to be committed 
to jail or how they are to be treated. After the minor is turned over to the 
court for sentence, article 80 ceases to have any interest in him or her. On 
saying that the 16- and 18-year old should no longer be given a trial or placed 
on probation in a reformatory institution but should go straight to prison upon 
conviction, Republic Act No. 47 does not, by implication or otherwise, connote 
that such minors should also be deprived of a reduced penalty. In no standard of 
statutory construction is there support for the proposition that the mitigating 
circumstance which minors between 16 and 18 enjoyed before Republic Act No. 47 
came into being, <em>not withstanding the fact that they had shown evidence of 
incorrigibility</em>, should be denied them now for no other reason than that 
the right to be committed to a reformatory school has been taken away from them; 
now that they are confined in jail without having committed any fault other than 
the crime for which they were prosecuted in the first instance.</p>
<p align="left">Let it be remembered that by virtue of the amendment, minors 
between 16 and 18 do not now come under the provisions of the paragraph next to 
the last of article 80.</p>
<p align="left">Of course, the effect of a law amendment would be different if the 
amendatory law had absorbed the law which it had amended. In that case, the 
original law would become part and parcel of the new law, with the result that 
if the amendatory law be later repealed, both the law and the law which it had 
superseded or amended would be considered abrogated. There was no law which of 
its own force could survive.</p>
<p align="left">But, as we have indicated, article 68 as well as its predecessor 
is an independent provision and has not been merged with article 80 or any other 
of the Revised Penal Code. It is an independent provision inoperative only 
during the suspension of the sentence but possessing all the vigor which article 
85 of the Spanish Code had, when the minors are sentenced to jail.</p>
<p align="left">In the decision sought to be reconsidered, we emphasize the rule 
of statutory construction to the effect the all parts of a statute are to be 
harmonized and reconciled so that effect may be given to each and every part 
thereof, and that conflicting intentions in the same statute are never to be 
supposed or so regarded, unless force upon the court by an unambiguous language. 
(59 C. J., 999.) The motion for reconsideration has not pointed to any conflict, 
and we can not find any, between the retention of the privileged or special 
mitigating circumstance in favor of minors are not entitled to the benefits of 
article 80 under any circumstances. The motion for reconsideration is 
conspicuous for its silence on any incongruity or absurdity that might result 
from our ruling on the scope and extent of Republic Act No. 47.</p>
<p align="left">The sole consideration that might commend itself in favor of the 
Government's position is the general welfare. For the good of society it may 
have been better if Republic Act No. 47 had amended article 13 and 68 also by 
correspondingly reducing the age of accused minors entitled to a mitigating 
circumstance by reason of age. But it is trite to say that we are not authorize 
to insert into a law what we think should be in it or to supply what we think 
the legislature would have supplied if its attention had been called to the 
omission. This is especially true in penal legislation which, as we have 
repeatedly stressed in our decision, has to be construed strictly. But there is 
not even room for construction in this case. The preamble or explanatory note to 
Republic Act No. 47 cannot be used as basis for giving it a meaning not apparent 
on its face. A preamble or explanatory note is resorted to only for 
clarification in cases of doubt. There is no ambiguity in Republic Act No. 
47.</p>
