				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing plaintiff's complaint on the ground that it states no cause of action against the defendant.<br><br>The complaint&nbsp; alleges that the defendant employed one Pedro Estrada as a chauffeur,&nbsp; who operated defendant's car in Baguio on April 6, 1940; that on said date the said chauffeur, in driving the defendant's automobile No. 1-9940, thru negligence, carelessness, and imprudence,&nbsp; caused the said automobile to bump and&nbsp; hit the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; while the latter was pouring water into the tank of the automobile belonging to&nbsp; his&nbsp; employer, Mr. Manuel Aguas, which was then parked in front of Villa Carmelita in Baguio; that the plaintiff suffered physical injuries, his kneeball having been broken, and was&nbsp; confined in the hospital from April 6 to May 4,&nbsp; 1940; that before the&nbsp; accident he was&nbsp; earning a salary of P35 a month, but that as a result of the accident he became permanently disabled to perform his ordinary work. The plaintiff claims damages from the defendant in the sum of P10,000, upon the allegation that the defendant did not use and exercise all the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection of his said chauffeur.<br><br>The action is predicated upon article 1903, in relation to article 1902,&nbsp; of the Civil Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two articles read as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1902.—Any person who by an act or omission causes damage to another by his fault or&nbsp; negligence shall be liable for the damage so done.<br><br>"Art. 1903.—The obligation imposed by the next preceding&nbsp; article is enforcible,&nbsp; not only for personal acts and omissions, but also for those of persons for whom another is responsible.<br><br>"The father, or in case of his death, or incapacity,&nbsp; the mother, is liable for any damages caused by the minor children who live, with them.<br><br>"Owners or directors of any establishment or business are, in the same way, liable for any damages caused by their employees while engaged in the&nbsp; branch of the service in which employed, or on occasion of the performance of their duties.<br><br>"The State is subject to the same liability when it acts through a special agent, but not&nbsp; if the damage shall have been caused by the official&nbsp; upon&nbsp; whom properly devolved the duty of doing&nbsp; the&nbsp; act performed, in which case the provisions of the next preceding article shall be applicable.<br><br>"Finally, teachers or directors of arts and trades are liable for&nbsp; any damages caused by their pupils or apprentices while they are under their custody.<br><br>"The liability imposed by this article shall cease in case the persons subject thereto prove&nbsp; that they exercised all the diligence of a good father of a family to&nbsp; prevent the damage."</blockquote>It is&nbsp; needless to&nbsp; say&nbsp; that article 1902&nbsp; is not applicable against the present defendant—even assuming as true the allegation that he&nbsp; failed to exercise all the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection of his&nbsp; chauffeur— because such failure&nbsp; on his part was not the proximate cause of the damage complained of.&nbsp; He did hot by such act or omission cause the damage in&nbsp; question.&nbsp; Said article would be applicable against the defendant's chauffeur alone, who himself was guilty of the negligent acts by which the damage was caused.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Johnson <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> David,&nbsp; 5 Phil., 663, 666- 667.)&nbsp; It is,&nbsp; however, insisted for the appellant that the appellee should be held responsible&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; acts of his chauffeur under article 1903.&nbsp; But said article specifies the persons who are held responsible for the acts and omissions of another; and, as found&nbsp; by this Court in the cases of Johnson <i>vs.</i> David, <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; and Chapman vs.&nbsp; Underwood, 27 PhiL, 374, "the&nbsp; driver&nbsp; does not fall within the list of persons in&nbsp; Article 1903&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Civil&nbsp; Code for whose acts the defendant would be responsible."&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; alleged that the appellee is the owner or director of an establishment or business and that he&nbsp; was employing his chauffeur in such business at the time the latter is alleged to have caused the damage.<br><br>We are not persuaded that the interpretation of the codal provisions in question heretofore made by this Court in the cases above cited is wrong.&nbsp; Indeed, we feel that&nbsp; for the Court to so interpret said provisions as&nbsp; to include&nbsp; persons other than those therein specified as liable for the acts and omissions of another would be an&nbsp; invasion of the&nbsp; powers and&nbsp; prerogatives of the legislature.&nbsp; The later of&nbsp; the two cases above cited (Chapman <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Underwood) was&nbsp; decided by this Court on March 28, 1914, and for nearly three decades the legislature has not seen fit to&nbsp; change the law&nbsp; as interpreted by this&nbsp; Court.<br><br>The judgment appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; affirmed, but no finding is made as to costs because the appellant has beep allowed to litigate&nbsp; as a pauper.<br><br><i>Yulo, C. J., Moran</i>, and <i>Horrilleno, JJ,</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1"><br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">DISSENTING<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">BOCOBO, J.,</span> with whom concurs <span style="font-weight: bold;">PARAS, J.,</span> <br><br>I&nbsp; am constrained to dissent because&nbsp; I believe the strict and narrow interpretation by the majority overthrows the principle of responsibility enunciated in article 1903 of the Civil Code,&nbsp; The majority opinion by exempting from liability those employers who are not engaged in&nbsp; any enterprise defeats the object which the legislator contemplated.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>Articles 1902 and 1903 provide:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1902.—El que por accion u omision causa daño a otro, interviniendo culpa o negligencia, esta&nbsp; obligado a reparar el dano causado.<br><br>"Art. 1903.—Lo obligacion que impone&nbsp; el artlculo&nbsp; anterior es exigible, no solo&nbsp; por los actos u omisiones propios, sino por&nbsp; los de aquellas&nbsp; personas de quienes&nbsp; se&nbsp; debe responder.<br><br>"El padre, y, por muerte o incapacidad de este, la madre, son responsables de los perjuicios causados por&nbsp; los hijos menores de edad que yiven en su compania.<br><br>"Los tutores lo son de los perjuicios causados por los menores o incapacitados que estan bajo su autoridad y habitan en su compania.<br><br>"Lo son igualmente los dueños o directores de un establecimiento o empresa, respecto de&nbsp; los perjuicios causados por sus&nbsp; dependientes en el servicio&nbsp; de los ramos en que los tuvieran empleados o con ocasion de sus funciones.<br><br>"El Estado es responsable en este concepto cuando obra por mediacion de un agente especial;&nbsp; pero no cuando el daño hubiese sido causado por el funcionario a quien propiamente corresponda la gestion practicada, en cuyo caso sera aplicable lo dispuesto en el articulo anterior.<br><br>"Son, por ultimo,&nbsp; responsables los maestros o directores de artes y oficios respecto a los perjuicios causados por sus alumnos o aprendices, mientras&nbsp; permanezcan bajo su custodia.<br><br>"La responsabilidad&nbsp; de que trata este&nbsp; articulo cesara cuando&nbsp; las personas en el&nbsp; mencionadas prueben que&nbsp; emplearon toda la diligencia de un buen padre de familia para prevenir el daño."</blockquote>It will be seen that the first paragraph formulates a general principle, while the ensuing enumeration refers to those persons who are <i>presumed</i> to have acted negligently either in choice or supervision.&nbsp; But this list does not free from liability those persons who, though not included in the enumeration, are nevertheless in fact negligent and therefore come within the general principle.&nbsp; In the instant case, although the defendant is not one of those who are <i>presumed</i> to be negligent because he is not the owner or director of an establishment or&nbsp; enterprise, yet he is responsible on the general principle of&nbsp; the first paragraph of article 1903 because the complaint alleges&nbsp; (and defendant admits in his motion&nbsp; to dismiss the complaint)&nbsp; that he&nbsp; (defendant) has been&nbsp; negligent&nbsp; in the&nbsp; selection&nbsp; of Pedro&nbsp; Estrada as his driver,&nbsp; and that he has&nbsp; negligently failed to prevent the damage.&nbsp; Paragraphs 3&nbsp; and 9 of the complaint allege:<br><blockquote>"3. That defendant did not use and exercise all&nbsp; the diligence of a good father of a family in&nbsp; the selection of his said chauffeur,&nbsp; so that he has engaged and employed the services of the said operator who is careless, negligent, and imprudent in the performance of his service as such auto operator;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"9. That defendant was and still is duty bound to pay damages to plaintiff, due to the carelessness of his chauffeur, as alleged above, which caused the physical disability of the plaintiff, and further, because of his failure to exercise all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent the said accident and the said damage, but defendant never has shown willingness to pay damage to said plaintiff;"</blockquote>In other words, if the defendant had been the owner or director of any establishment or enterprise, it would not have&nbsp; been necessary to allege&nbsp; negligence on&nbsp; his&nbsp; part in choosing or overseeing his driver Estrada, because such negligence would have been&nbsp; presumed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Art. 1903, but inasmuch as he is neither an owner nor a director of any business, it was necessary to&nbsp; allege&nbsp; negligence on his part in selecting his driver, and by failing to prevent the damage, which allegations were made in the complaint in this case and admitted in the motion to&nbsp; dismiss the complaint.<br><br>Paragraph 2 of article 1903, Civil Code, reads, "El padre, y, por muerte o incapacidad de este, la madre, son responsables de los perjuicios causados&nbsp; por los hijos menores <i>que viven en su compania</i>".&nbsp; Supposing a case of negligence of a son, who was <i>not living</i> with&nbsp; his father, would the latter be responsible for the former's negligence? I believe that if the father and the son happened to be together at the time of the damage,&nbsp; and the father was negligent in not preventing the son's negligent act, the father would be liable. My reason is that although the father is <i>not presumed</i> to be negligent because his son is <i>not</i> living with him, yet because the father proved to be negligent, he is, in my opinion, responsible.<br><br>The above illustrates my theory that the enumeration of cases in article 1903&nbsp; does not exclude other cases where the father, employer, etc., are shown to have been negligent.<br><br>In addition to the foregoing hypothetical case, let me present this one:&nbsp; Referring to&nbsp; owners of establishments, suppose the employee negligently caused the damage while he was doing work in a branch <i>other than</i> that in which he was regularly employed, but the owner or&nbsp; employer was present and he was really and&nbsp; actually negligent&nbsp; in&nbsp; not preventing the damage?&nbsp; I believe the owner or employer is liable, although paragraph 4 of article 1903 requires that the employee be "en el servicio de&nbsp; los rames en que&nbsp; los tuvieran empleados o con ocasi6n&nbsp; de sus funciones."&nbsp; My reason again is that although the owner or employer is <i>not</i> presumed to&nbsp; be negligent because the employee was doing work in another&nbsp; branch, nevertheless, the&nbsp; owner or&nbsp; employer being actually negligent, he&nbsp; is liable.<br><br>Another case may&nbsp; be supposed:&nbsp; There is a <i>private charitable</i> institution where beggars&nbsp; live and are taken care of. One of the employees through negligence, while burning certain odds and ends, caused a neighboring nipa house to catch fire and to be burned down.&nbsp;&nbsp; The owner or director of&nbsp; the institution had been previously&nbsp; warned of the danger&nbsp; but he negligently failed to prevent the employee's negligent act. I believe the owner or director is liable, although the charitable institution is not one of the&nbsp; cases enumerated in article 1903, My reason is the same:&nbsp; The owner or director was really and actually negligent, though he is <i>not presumed to be so.</i><br><br>The same reasoning and conclusion may be had in the case of&nbsp; a private physician who&nbsp; negligently fails to supervise his nurse whose negligence causes injury to a patient.<br><br>Other cases could&nbsp; be supposed, but these four show that the enumeration of instances of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">presumed</span> negligence in article 1903 does not exclude cases of actual and proved negligence.<br><br>In the&nbsp; present case it is&nbsp; alleged in the complaint (and admitted in the motion to dismiss)&nbsp; that defendant was negligent&nbsp; in&nbsp; not preventing the damage.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; he is liable under article 1903.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>Let me now take up the two cases relied upon by the majority: Johnson <i>vs.</i> David, and&nbsp; Chapman <i>vs.</i> Underwood. Those two cases support my opinion that the defendant herein is liable.<br><br>In the first case, Johnson <i>vs.</i> David, 5 Phil., 663, it was found that the master had not been negligent either in the selection of or&nbsp; vigilance over his <i>cochero</i>.&nbsp; This Court said:<br><blockquote>"The question presented by these facts is, Is the owner of a carriage driven by his <i>cochero</i>, liable for injuries growout of the negligence of said <i>cochero</i>, in&nbsp; the absence of such owner ?<br><br>"No evidence was adduced during the trial of said cause to show that the defendant had been negligent in the employment of the <i>cochero</i> or that he had any knowledge that such <i>cochero</i> was&nbsp; incompetent or of the general&nbsp; negligent character of said <i>cochero</i>, if such existed.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp; (p. 666.)</blockquote>In the other case, Chapman <i>vs.</i> Underwood, 27 Phil., 374, it was also found&nbsp; that the defendant, the owner of the automobile,&nbsp; although present in the vehicle,&nbsp; had&nbsp; had no reasonable opportunity to prevent the driver's&nbsp; negligent act.&nbsp; This Court said:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; On the other hand, if the driver, by a sudden act of negligence, and without the owner having reasonable opportunity to&nbsp; prevent the act&nbsp; or the continuance,&nbsp; injures a person or violates the criminal&nbsp; law, the owner of the automobile, although present therein at the time the act was committed, is not responsible, either civilly or criminally, therefor.&nbsp; The&nbsp; act complained of must be continued in the presence of the owner for such a length of time that the owner, by his acquiescence, makes his driver's act his own.<br><br>"In the case before us it does not appear from the record that from the time the automobile took the wrong side of the road to the commission of the injury,&nbsp; sufficient time intervened to give the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; an opportunity to correct the act of his driver. Instead, it appears with fair clearness that the interval between the turning out to meet and pass the street car and the&nbsp; happening of the accident&nbsp; was so small as not to be sufficient to charge defendant with the negligence of the driver." (p. 377.)</blockquote>It is thus&nbsp; clear that this Court, in the two cases cited by the majority, did not hold the owner of the private vehicle responsible as he was not negligent either in employing or overseeing his driver.&nbsp; These two cases impliedly hold that if the owner of a private vehicle is negligent, in the choice of or vigilance over his driver, he (the owner) is liable.&nbsp; In the instant case, the defendant was negligent in these particulars, as&nbsp; alleged in the complaint&nbsp; and admitted by defendant in his motion to dismiss.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>The defendant is liable not only as employer of the driver (Art. 1903)&nbsp; but&nbsp; also as <i>owner</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; the automobile.&nbsp; If we analyze Chapter II, Title XVI of Book IV&nbsp; (Arts. 1902-1910) which treats of obligations arising from <i>culpa</i> or negligence, it will be noted that after enunciating the general principle of responsibility for <i>culpa aquiliana</i> (Art. 1902), the chapter proceeds to&nbsp; regulate the liability&nbsp; under two aspects: first, responsibilty for another person's&nbsp; negligence (Arts. 1903-1904)&nbsp; and obligation for damage caused by a person's property (Arts. 1905-1910). The defendant as the owner of the automobile is liable for damages, it being admitted in the motion to&nbsp; dismiss that the driver acted with negligence, carelessness and imprudence.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Arts. 1905-1910.) It seems unreasonable and unjust to exempt the owner of a private automobile simply&nbsp; because he is not specifically listed in articles 1905-1910, ignoring the fact that he plainly comes within the fundamental principle of those articles. As Manresa says in commenting on the explosion of engines, excessive smoke, etc. in article 1908:&nbsp;&nbsp; (Vol. 12, p. 640, Manresa, <i>Comentarios Al Codigo Civil</i>.)<br><br>"Respondiendo dicho&nbsp; articulo al <i>principio general</i> que informa la materia objeto de este capitulo, de&nbsp; que&nbsp; aquel que cause a otro un daño por accion u omision, mediando culpa o negligencia, debe repararlo,&nbsp; enumera algunos casos que pueden dar lugar a dicha reparation; pero debemos advertir que no son los unicos, y que la cita&nbsp; de los cuatro&nbsp; expresamente consignados en el referido articulo solo esta hecha demostrationis causa; y en su virtud, <i>en todos aquellos otros que puedan suscitarse&nbsp; en la prdctica, y&nbsp; en que exista&nbsp; la misma razon fundamental, habra lugar a la reparation</i>, porque esta no depende de la expresion en la ley de las causas que la motivo, sino del <i>principio</i> esencial que antes hemos dicho, y por consiguiente, no&nbsp; puede dejar de haber lugar a ella porque los casos o sus causas no figuran en el Codigo,<br><br>"<i>Esta es la opinion general&nbsp; de&nbsp; los tratadistas,&nbsp; y&nbsp; lo contrario resultaria una injusticia irritante</i> y&nbsp; un desconocimiento de los derechos de los perjudicados, falto de toda razon juridica."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br><br>It will be observed that applying the principle of analogy, Manresa includes the ownership of <i>other things</i> than those enumerated in these articles because the same fundamental reason exists.&nbsp; And we know that automobiles have killed and injured more people than&nbsp; have dogs or ruinous buildings,&nbsp; or&nbsp; exploding engines or any of the things specified in articles 1905-1910.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV.<br></div><br>Coming&nbsp; now to a more detailed discussion&nbsp; of analogy as applied in&nbsp; this case, the principle of analogy should be distinguished&nbsp; from liberal&nbsp; interpretation.&nbsp; Under the principle&nbsp; of analogy, the complaint herein states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<br><br>Professor Clemente&nbsp; de Diego, an&nbsp; outstanding authority on the Spanish civil law and author of several books on the civil law of Spain, has written&nbsp; an essay on "La Analogia en el Codigo Civil Español" in&nbsp; the <i>Revista de Derecho Privado</i>, (Vol. I, pp. 370-376, Sept. 1914).<br><br>After citing&nbsp; certain provisions&nbsp; to show&nbsp; that analogy is authorized by the Spanish Civil Code,&nbsp; he says:<br><blockquote>"La misma prescription del articulo&nbsp; 6.o,&nbsp; al invocar los principios&nbsp; generales de&nbsp; derecho&nbsp; como fuente juridica en defecto de ley y de costumbre, comprueba la tesis, toda vez que el procedimiento analogico es el primer paso&nbsp; en la indagacion y aplicacion de tales principios.<br><br>"La analogia forma parte de la dotacidn de medios&nbsp; e instruments con que el poder judicial cuenta para el&nbsp; ejercicio de su mision.&nbsp; Tampoco de la interpretacion se dice nada en el titulo preliminar del Codigo;&nbsp; solo se dan reglas mas alia con respecto a&nbsp; testamentos y contratos, y ¿quien puede deducir de ahi que no es licito a los jueces interpretar las leyes?&nbsp; La interpretacion y la analogia son&nbsp; recursos naturales e intrinsecos elementos de la funcion de juzgar que no han menester de declaracion expresa del legislador&nbsp; para ser licitamente empleados."</blockquote>De Diego then proceeds to discuss the nature of analogy in part thus:<br><blockquote>"¿Cual es&nbsp; la naturaleza de&nbsp; la analogia?&nbsp; ¿Es un simple modo de interpretacion y aplicacion del derecho,&nbsp; o es mas bien un procedimiento de produccion del derecho y en tal respecto verdadera&nbsp; fuente juridica?&nbsp;&nbsp; Entre&nbsp; los autores antiguos era muy general confundirla con la interpretacion extensiva, sin pensar&nbsp; en que en esta al fin hay una voluntad real del legislador, bien que expresada en formula estrecha e inadecuada, mientras que en <i>la analogia falta completamente esa voluntad</i> en cuanto que el legislador no previ6 el caso de que se trata.&nbsp;&nbsp; Savigny y Thol, en las obras citadas en estos articulos, creen que interpretacion y analogia son dos cosas distintas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Winscheid y Unger—a cuya opinion se inclina Regelsberger—entienden que es un procedimiento intermedio&nbsp; entre&nbsp; la&nbsp;&nbsp; interpretaci6n&nbsp; y la produccion del derecho, acercandose mas- a aquella la analogia de ley y a esta. la&nbsp; de derecho.&nbsp; Geny, que tan a fondo ha&nbsp; estudiado la cuestion, la coloca decididamente fuera de la interpretacion, constituyendo un&nbsp; procedimiento especial de investigacion cientifica del derecho <i>y de alumbramiento de nuevas reglas juridicas</i>, bien que tomando por hilo conductor el espiritu y disposiciones concretas de un derecho positivo.<br><br>"En la analogia, si es de ley,&nbsp; sobre la base&nbsp; de una disposicion legal se busca una solucion para un caso no comprendido en ella, solucion <i>que habria dado el legislador si en el caso hubiera pensado</i>; si es de derecho,&nbsp; montandose&nbsp; por encima de todo el derecho positivo y&nbsp; guiada por los principios&nbsp; informadores&nbsp; de este, busca&nbsp; una&nbsp; solucion que no discrepe,&nbsp; sino que este en armonia con el espiritu general del derecho.&nbsp; Manteniendose la analogia dentro de este&nbsp; y buscando tan solo las soluciones latentes en&nbsp; el sistema de un derecho, hay que convenir en que es mas bien un procedimiento de aplicacion del derecho que de creacion del mismo.<br><br>"Pero no es pura aplicacion&nbsp; del derecho ni mera&nbsp; interpretation, <i>porque esta no fija ni halla normas nuevas como la analogia</i>.&nbsp; En efecto, no es la norma misma&nbsp; que&nbsp; preve un caso la que se aplica a otro semejante,&nbsp; <i>sino el principio juridico fundamental&nbsp; de&nbsp; aquella norma</i>,&nbsp; y por tanto mas general y comprensivo del caso&nbsp; previsto y del no previsto; ese principio en esta&nbsp; determination&nbsp; representa&nbsp; una regla mas alta y extensa que la primitivamente formulada.&nbsp; No es, ya lo hemos visto, pura aplicacion mecanica de&nbsp; una norma existente a un caso en ella no comprendido, <i>sino investigation&nbsp; de&nbsp; un principio mas elevado y mas&nbsp; general&nbsp; y obtencion de una regla aplicable a los dos casos semejantes.</i><br><br>"De todo lo dicho hasta aqui se deduce la diferencia&nbsp; que corre entre la interpretacion&nbsp; y&nbsp; la analogia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Como acertadamente dice Coviello, difieren&nbsp; por sus supuestos, por su fin y por su resultado.&nbsp;&nbsp; Por sus supuestos, porque la analogia supone la falta de norma expresa,&nbsp; mientras la interpretacion supone su existencia.&nbsp; Por&nbsp; su fin, porque el de la analogia es la investigacion del priricipio juridico, del que emana la regla por aplicar al caso&nbsp; previsto y al no previsto; el de la interpretacion es hallar el sentido de la norma.&nbsp; Por sus resultados, porque la analogia fija una regla nueva, latente y no formulada en el sistema juridico, lo que no sucede en la interpretation.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"Claro es que tienen un elemento&nbsp; comun, y esto es el motivo principal de la confusi6n general de&nbsp; los dos procedimientos.&nbsp; El elemento comun consiste en que en ambos se trata de un caso no comprendido en las palabras de la norma, y la diferencia esta en si esta o no previsto&nbsp; en&nbsp; el entendimiento del legislador; lo primero es mas visible ciertamente que lo segundo, y he aqui la razon de por que no escudrinando atentamente las cosas seamos dados a estimar por interpretacion extensiva lo que no es mas que&nbsp; aplicacion analogica,"</blockquote>It is&nbsp; my humble&nbsp; opinion, therefore,&nbsp; that the principle of analogy, as conceived by the jurists, and as distinguished from liberal interpretation, would place the owner of a private&nbsp; automobile within the "principio juridico fundamental" of liability&nbsp; under Articles&nbsp; 1902-1910 of the Civil Code, although&nbsp; such owner was not <i>specifically</i> foreseen by&nbsp; the lawmaking body.&nbsp; Examining articles 1902-1910 of the Civil Code, one can see the general principle of responsibility&nbsp; for <i>culpa aquiliana</i> in Article 1902,&nbsp; and then such liability is applied to acts of dependents&nbsp; (Articles 1903-4), and on&nbsp; account of the <i>ownership</i> of property, whether the negligence is of the owner or of persons under him.&nbsp; (Arts. 1905-1910).<br><br>As to the first kind (acts of dependents),&nbsp; I reiterate the view that the enumeration in article 1903 (parents, guardians, directors of&nbsp; establishments, the State&nbsp; and teachers) is complete <i>only</i> as to those who are <i>presumed</i> to be negligent in the selection or supervision, but does not exclude those who, though not mentioned in Art. 1903,&nbsp; are alleged and proved to be negligent in selection or supervision.&nbsp; Such is the <i>ratio decidendi</i> in the two previous cases of <i>Johnson vs. David</i> and <i>Chapman vs. Underwood.</i><br><br>Now then, by analogy as conceived by De Diego and other jurists, the employer of a driver of a private&nbsp; automobile comes within the&nbsp; fundamental principle of liability of one person&nbsp; for another's acts because of negligence in selection or&nbsp; supervision, even though such employer was not specifically foreseen by&nbsp; the drafters of the Civil&nbsp; Code.<br><br>For the same reason, the defendant is liable as the owner of the private automobile because he comes under the "principio juridico fundamental:&nbsp; (of which De Diego speaks) regarding the liability for damages caused by one's property.&nbsp; In this case, the automobile&nbsp; pertained to defendant, and the defendant's driver was&nbsp; admittedly negligent.<br><br>The rule of analogy—<i>eadem dispositio, ubi eadem ratio</i>— is plainly applicable to the present&nbsp; case.&nbsp; What is the reason for the general principle found in&nbsp; the first paragraph of article 1903?&nbsp;&nbsp; That a person is liable for the acts of those who are under his custody or in&nbsp; his employment because of his negligence in not preventing the&nbsp; damage.&nbsp; As Manresa says:<br><blockquote>"Desarrollando&nbsp; en ellos&nbsp; el Codigo los principios fundamentales de&nbsp; dicha responsabilidad, la&nbsp; impone&nbsp; por&nbsp; cuatro conceptos distintos, en&nbsp; todos los&nbsp; cuales son extraños al obligado los&nbsp; actos u omisiones determinantes del daño reparable, pero en los que no deja de haber una&nbsp;

Por los danos y&nbsp; perjuicios causados por las personas que el responsable tuviera bajo su custodia o dependencia.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"Por la misma razon,&nbsp; aquel que por su industria, por su profesion o por <i>otras circunstancias</i>, tuviere alguna&nbsp; otra persona a su servicio&nbsp; o&nbsp; bajo su dependencia&nbsp; u custodia— como sucede a los dueños o directores de un establecimiento o empresa respecto de sus dependientes, y a los maestros o directores de artes y oficios con relacion a sus alumnos y aprendices—, debe exigir de ella que cumpla su cometido con la actividad y diligencia necesaria, y si por faltar a estas diera origen a un perjuicio, deben&nbsp; venir obligados a indemnizar al&nbsp; perjudicado aquel que tuviera a&nbsp; su servicio a bajo su vigilancia al que causo el daño,&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp; (pp. 607, and 608-609.)</blockquote>Now, then, the&nbsp; reason for holding an employer in&nbsp; business,—that is, because he negligently failed to prevent the damage—liable is&nbsp; the same reason for holding an employer who is <i>not in business</i>, answerable, namely, that he negligently did not prevent the damage.&nbsp; Indeed, there is greater reason for making the owner of an automobile for personal use responsible than the proprietor of a motor&nbsp; vehicle devoted to business.&nbsp; The former keeps a car for comfort and convenience, while the latter's maintenance of a motor ve hicle contributes to tjie economic&nbsp; development of the country. Incidentally, it shoujd'be remembered that all governments&nbsp; discourage the&nbsp; luxury of&nbsp; having private cars for pleasure.<br><br>At this juncture, it is well to remember that the rule declared in the first paragraph of article 1903 is found in all legal systems because it embodies&nbsp; a general principle of justice, which is, that one must exercise due care in supervising a minor, ward or pupil, or in selecting and supervising an employee.<br><br>That par. 1 of article 1903 expresses&nbsp; a general principle is seen when we read Manresa's comment as above quoted.<br><br>It will be noted that according to Manresa, the code develops four "fundamental&nbsp; principles":&nbsp;&nbsp; that a person&nbsp; is liable when&nbsp; he has others under his "custodia o dependencia"; and that such responsibility exists when a person by his&nbsp; industry, profession, or <i>other circumstances</i> has others in&nbsp; his&nbsp; service&nbsp; or employment.&nbsp;&nbsp; There being&nbsp; a general principle of&nbsp; right, it should be given a wide application..&nbsp; It is for&nbsp; such&nbsp; situation as&nbsp; the present&nbsp; that the Roman law ordered the&nbsp; judge "ad similia procedere" because the law could not cover&nbsp; all cases, and no exception or limitation should be made unless&nbsp; it is clearly and expressly laid down by the law.&nbsp; In this case, however, the majority makes an exception by mere inference and&nbsp; implication, in open contravention of the general principle&nbsp; under consideration, and resulting in a&nbsp; manifest injustice because though the plaintiff has been permanently disabled for ordinary work, the&nbsp; majority would have him obtain the indemnity from the&nbsp; driver, Pedro Estrada,&nbsp; who is presumably too poor to pay adequate damages. To compel plaintiff to seek an illusory remedy is a virtual denial of&nbsp; that remedy. He&nbsp; is placed between Scylla and Charybdis, for while he can not sue the employer, he can get no satisfaction from an impecunious driver.&nbsp; As&nbsp; Manresa says, one of the reasons for article 1903 is that employees do not usually have sufficient means for indemnity (comment on Arts. 1903 and 1904).<br><br>Moreover, the principal basis of the liability recognized in article 1903 is the negligence of the employer in failing to prevent&nbsp; the damage&nbsp; (Manresa's comment, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; But the majority in&nbsp; exonerating the defendant simply because he is&nbsp; not engaged in business would change the philosophy of article 1903 from that of negligence on the part of the employer in selecting and supervising the employee into that of economic benefit for the employer.&nbsp; Such a shift of juridical foundation&nbsp; of article 1903 is warranted lpy neither the letter nor the spirit thereof.&nbsp; Nor can such alteration of philosophy be justified in any manner, for it is absolutely indifferent to the injured party whether or not the employer is engaged&nbsp; in business; what is important to him and in the interest of justice is that he be indemnified by the person who has been&nbsp; admittedly negligent in selecting the careless driver and in failing to prevent the damage.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">V.<br></div><br>Laws should&nbsp; be progressively&nbsp; construed, so that they may meet new conditions, so long as they fall within the general purpose of the legislature.<br><br>Thus we read in 26 R. C. L., pp. 778-9:<br><blockquote>"24. <i>Extension of Operation to New Cases and Subjects.</i> —A general law&nbsp; may, and frequently does, originate in some&nbsp; particular&nbsp; case or class of cases which is in the mind of the legislature at the time, but so long as it is expressed in general language the courts cannot, in the absence of ex- press&nbsp; restrictions, limit its application to these&nbsp; cases, but must&nbsp; apply it to all&nbsp; cases that come within the terms and its <i>general purpose and policy</i>.&nbsp; Hence statutes&nbsp; framed in general terms apply to new cases&nbsp; that arise, and&nbsp; to new subjects that&nbsp; are&nbsp; created,&nbsp; from time to&nbsp; time, and which <i>come&nbsp; within their general scope and policy</i>.&nbsp; It is a rule of statutory construction that legislative&nbsp; enactments&nbsp; in general&nbsp; and&nbsp; comprehensive terms, prospective in operation, apply alike to all persons, subjects and business within their <i>general</i> purview and scope coming into existence subsequent to their passage."</blockquote>It is this progressive interpretation that keeps legislation from becoming ephemeral and transitory.&nbsp; It is obvious that legislators want their creation to be a rule of conduct for an indefinite time.&nbsp; To carry out that&nbsp; desire of the legislator,&nbsp; a statute should always be made adaptable by&nbsp; the courts to&nbsp; the changing conditions of&nbsp; the social order.&nbsp; A strict interpretation, such as the majority adheres to, would render a statute obsolete shortly after it has been enacted, for human progress is always on the wing.&nbsp; Consequently, judicial statesmanship is ever mindful that time&nbsp; and tide wait for no static, fossilized statute, which&nbsp; is the&nbsp; fetish of rigid, literal interpretation.&nbsp; Courts are not museums for useless, anachronistic laws.<br><br>Therefore, while it is true that the&nbsp; speeding&nbsp; automobile was&nbsp; not yet in existence in 1889, when the Spanish Civil Code was&nbsp; promulgated,&nbsp; nevertheless,&nbsp; because&nbsp; it&nbsp; had&nbsp; become such a public menace when this case arose, killing and maiming countless people&nbsp; everywhere, it should&nbsp; for this very reason be deemed to be within the rule of liability of the employer, whether the employee is driving it for the master's profit or pleasure.&nbsp; This latter-day, speeding Juggernaut must somehow be curbed by making all owners responsible so that they will be careful in the choice and supervision of their drivers.<br><br>It is not quite accurate to say, as the majority does, that the Legislature has not seen fit to change the law&nbsp; as interpreted by this Court.&nbsp; Sec. 65, Act No. 3992 (the&nbsp; Automobile Law) makes it the duty of the operator, in case&nbsp; of an accident, to give the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle, and it is also the duty of the <i>owner</i> Or driver of an automobile to notify the police.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said statutory provision reads:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 65. <i>Duties in case of accident.</i>—In the event that any&nbsp; accident should occur&nbsp; as a&nbsp; result of the operation of a motor vehicle upon a highway, the operator shall stop immediately, and, if requested by any person present, shall show his chauffeur's license, give his true name and address and also the true name and address of the <i>owner</i> of the motor vehicle.<br><br>"It shall&nbsp; be the duty of the <i>owner</i>&nbsp; or driver of a motor vehicle to notify at once&nbsp; the&nbsp; nearest peace officer, police station,&nbsp; or municipality&nbsp; when it comes&nbsp; to&nbsp; his knowledge that his vehicle has&nbsp; been concerned in an accident."</blockquote>It will thus be seen that recent legislation impliedly places upon both the <i>owner</i> and&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver&nbsp; the duty&nbsp; of preventing accidents by requiring the operator to give the name and address of&nbsp; the owner,&nbsp; and by making them report all such mishaps to the police&nbsp; so that the peace officers may inquire into the liability, if&nbsp; any, of either the owner or the driver, or both.&nbsp; It should be&nbsp; noted that the new&nbsp; law applies to <i>all</i> owners and drivers of automobiles, whether for business or&nbsp; not.<br><br>Therefore, even granting, <i>arguendo</i>, that article 1903 did not originally include automobiles not used for any enterprise, yet we must read said article in connection with the new Act (3992) and thus include automobiles within the scope of Art. 1903.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">VI.<br></div><br>It is an&nbsp; established rule of&nbsp; interpretation of laws and contracts, that in case of doubt, that construction which is in favor of natural right should be adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 294, Act 190; sec. 66, Rule 123, Rules of Court.)<br><br>In the instant case, it is admitted by defendant, through his motion&nbsp; to dismiss the complaint,&nbsp; that he&nbsp; has&nbsp; not exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection of Pedro Estrada as his chauffeur; that he engaged a careless driver; that he, defendant, failed to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent the damage; that said Estrada,&nbsp; in driving&nbsp; the defendant's&nbsp; automobile, through negligence, carelessness and&nbsp; imprudence, caused said automobile&nbsp; to bump and hit the plaintiff while&nbsp; the latter was pouring water into the tank of the car belonging to plaintiff's employer;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; suffered injuries which permanently disabled him to perform his ordinary work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore the plaintiff's natural right to be indemnified either by&nbsp; defendant or by the&nbsp; driver Estrada or by both.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the adoption of a strict interpretation of article 1903 leaves plaintiff helpless and dependent for the rest of his life, because he can not expect to&nbsp; obtain adequate damages from Estrada, who may reasonably be presumed to be without means to indemnify&nbsp; plaintiff. With due respect to my colleagues who signed the majority opinion, I can&nbsp; not bring myself to turn a deaf ear to plaintiff's plea for relief.&nbsp; I therefore unhesitatingly&nbsp; follow a liberal interpretation of article 1903, considering&nbsp; that the latter killeth and the spirit giveth life. To&nbsp; prevent the enormous injustice of letting this victim, who&nbsp; has been crippled for life, suffer&nbsp; uncompensated from the defendant's own admited negligence in&nbsp; selecting and supervising&nbsp; a careless driver, I would&nbsp; give efficacy to and apply&nbsp; in this case the general principle laid down in the first paragraph of article 1903 which I again quote:<br><blockquote>"La obligation que impone el articulo anterior es exigible, no solo por los&nbsp; actos&nbsp; u omisiones&nbsp; propios,&nbsp; sino&nbsp; por los de aquellas ^ersonas de quienes se debe responder."</blockquote>In this attitude, I do not share the majority's&nbsp; unfounded fear of invading the powers and prerogatives of the legislature because I think article 1903 plainly covers the present case, as already explained, and. because I&nbsp; am firmly&nbsp; persuaded that courts should breathe&nbsp; into the&nbsp; cold wording of codes&nbsp; and statutes the warm spirit of right and justice and equity.&nbsp; After all, the lawmaker can only frame the skeleton for the adjustment of rights among&nbsp; the citizens, so that it is the proper and inherent function of the courts to import to that skeleton tle flesh and blood and sinew of the reality of social conditions.&nbsp; Far from invading legislative powers, the courts in this manner fulfill their true mission by causing the legislature's theory to stir and pulsrate with the actuality of real problems in the relations among men, to the end that the abstract rule may become a living principle of effective justice.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">VII.<br></div><br>Finally, this case raises the serious question of whether courts should-tie their hands in the administration of justice. This is a problem that affects the very <i>raison d'etre</i> of the&nbsp; courts.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have, among&nbsp; other principles, that of analogy as presented by the jurists.&nbsp; Such principle which according to De Diego "forma parte de la dotacion de medios e instrumentos con que el poder judicial cuenta para el ejercicio de su mision", is at the disposal of the courts to prevent a palpable injustice as in the present case where a poor man, disabled for&nbsp; life because of negligence of others, entreats us to&nbsp; afford him&nbsp; relief.&nbsp; Should we deny him redress because of a timid concept of the&nbsp; judicial power?&nbsp; Any restricted and inadequate view of the judicial function&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; in keeping&nbsp; with&nbsp; the role which the courts have always played in the whole civilized world. To mention but a few well-known examples:&nbsp; the <i>jus honorarium</i> of the Roman praetor, the <i>usus modernus pandectarum</i> during the reception of the Roman law in Europe; and the decisions of the French courts which have for generations adapted the French Civil Code to changing conditions.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of the Philippines has in the last four decades&nbsp; likewise been&nbsp; a&nbsp; great factor in building up the Philippine legal system, in spite of many lapses into extreme legalism and technicality.&nbsp; I venture to say that the majority&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present&nbsp; case is one&nbsp; of&nbsp; those lapses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spanish Civil&nbsp; Code (Art. 6)&nbsp; ordains that the courts, in case of doubt, should apply the general principles of right or "derecho" (as&nbsp; distinguished from statute&nbsp; or "ley"),&nbsp; which include the norms of natural justice and good conscience.&nbsp; In this task the courts&nbsp; do not really "make laws."&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, in my humble&nbsp; opinion, the&nbsp; majority's fear of invading the powers and prerogatives of the legislature in this case, is groundless.&nbsp; Courts do not legislate by merely digging&nbsp; out of the bottom of primary&nbsp; concepts of&nbsp; right (or "derecho") a rule on which to base&nbsp; a decision, just as a miner does not "make" the gold which he extracts from the subsoil.&nbsp; The rule of analogy, as above set forth, is one of the tools with which courts bring out principles from the latent mass of right or "derecho".<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">VIII.<br></div><br>Summarizing, I believe defendant is liable because: <ol> <li>Though he is not presumed to be negligent, yet he is admitted to have been actually negligent.&nbsp; So this case is not excluded by article 1903.<br><br></li><li>The Johnson and Chapman cases&nbsp; support&nbsp; my theory because in those cases the defendants were exonerated on the ground that there was no proof they had, been negligent.<br><br></li><li>As owner of the private&nbsp; automobile, he is liable under&nbsp; articles 1905-1910,&nbsp; which make&nbsp; owners&nbsp; of&nbsp; things responsible for damages.<br><br></li><li>We must apply the following principles:<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; The&nbsp; rule of analogy, as distinguished from&nbsp; liberal interpretation.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; Progessive interpretation of statutes,<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)&nbsp; The&nbsp; construction favoring a natural right.&nbsp; Plaintiff being crippled for life, and the driver being too poor to pay adequate damages,&nbsp; the owner&nbsp; of the automobile should be solidarily liable with the driver.<br><br></li><li>This Court should not tie its hands in administering justice.&nbsp; Its duty is to help build up the Philippine legal system by a broad view of its functions. </li></ol> Therefore,&nbsp; I believe the complaint&nbsp; herein states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. My vote is for the reversal of the judgment appealed from. </div>
