				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal by the defendant, Jamiruddin Ibbo, from a 
judgment of the Court of First Instance of Sulu, finding him guilty of 
tripple murder with serious physical injuries, and sentencing him to <i>reclusion
 perpetua,</i> with legal accessories, and to indemnify the heirs of 
each of the three victims in the sum of P2,000.00, plus the costs.
  <p>    The evidence for the prosecution is to the effect that in the 
afternoon of April 29, 1945, Jumadin, his wife Hajira and children 
Marabiya and Hadjirani, and Imlani Asah were at the open kitchen on the 
ground floor of their house in Sionogan, district of Indanan, Sulu, when
 suddenly the appellant, together with Ali Itum and Salihon (the latter 
two being still at large), armed with spears, barongs and a kris, 
appeared and attacked them viciously.  Hajira received spear thrusts on 
her stomach, left ribs and left hand; Jumadin was speared through his 
abdomen, his intestines came out, and his left hand was severed; 
Hadjirani received a spear thrust on the left chest.  Jumadin and 
Hadjirani died on the spot, and Hajira at midnight of the same day.  
Imlani Asah was merely wounded on the left buttock.  When the assailants
 started the assault, Marabiya ran upstairs from where she was able to 
see the way it was carried out.  Shortly after the attackers had fled, 
Mayor Uddin of Indanan happened to pass by the house of Jumadin and 
found the latter and Hadjirani lying dead, Hajira still alive, and 
Imlani wounded on the left buttock.  Mayor Uddin talked to Hajira who 
disclosed that Jamiruddin was the one who speared her.  He also 
questioned Imlani, and the latter stated that the assailants were the 
appellant, Ali Itum and Salihon.  In the same evening Marabiya reported 
the incident to Captain Maut, constabulary detachment commander, who 
made an ocular inspection of the scene of the crime in the following 
morning.  Marabiya, however, did not file the complaint in the fiscal's 
office until after six years, because she was afraid of Ali Itum who was
 still at large.</p>
  <p>    The defense set up by the appellant is an alibi.  Without 
discussing this at length, we are of the opinion that the prosecution 
has not established beyond reasonable doubt the appellant's guilt.  It 
is very significant that, although Marabiya is alleged to have reported 
the matter to the constabulary commander on the same night of its 
occurrence, it is queer that she did not make any formal complaint 
before the proper prosecuting officials and it took her six years before
 doing so.  The allegation that she was afraid of a reprisal on the part
 of the assailants who were still at large, is rather weak, considering 
that she already had the courage to make an immediate report to Captain 
Maut.  Still more significant is the fact that the latter also failed to
 bring the case to the proper authorities with a view to prosecuting the
 culprits.  No less important is the further circumstance that, although
 the provincial fiscal filed an information against the alleged three 
assailants on April 9, 1949, said information was dismissed by the 
justice of the peace of Indanan.  On top of all these, although it is 
alleged by the prosecution that Mayor Uddin knew of the crime on the 
very night of its commission, with full information of the authors 
thereof, he likewise did not take the necessary steps for their 
apprehension and prosecution.</p>
  <p>    On the other hand, Imlani Asah was one of the persons attacked 
in the  house of Jumadin and, instead of testifying for the prosecution,
 testified for the defense, declaring particularly that Marabiya was not
 present on the occasion in question because she was in Tamban-tamban, 
the residence of her husband, four kilometers away from Sionogan, and 
that the assailants were only Ali Itum and Salihon.  As Imlani is 
related to Hajira, his aunt, it is improbable that he would testify 
falsely against his relatives and in favor of the latter's assailants.  
Although Imlani Asah signed an affidavit incriminating the appellant, he
 explained in open court that he told the fiscal who  investigated him 
that the appellant was not among those who entered the house of Jumadin;
 and the fiscal was not even presented by the prosecution as a rebuttal 
witness.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the appealed judgment is reversed and the 
defendant-appellant acquitted with costs <i>de oficio.</i> So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, 
Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
