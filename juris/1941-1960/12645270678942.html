				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In special proceeding  No. 3174 of  the  Court of First Instance of Batangas for the settlement of the  estate of the deceased Gavino de Jesus, the herein petitioners Mateo Maningat  and the spouses Eugenio  Pantoja and Leona Baltazar, having  respectively purchased the  interests  of the heirs Demetrio, Elena, and Maria de Jesus,  filed motions in said court praying that the sales be approved and that they as vendees be subrogated to the rights of their respective vendors in  the settlement  and  liquidation  of the estate of the  deceased.  Having previously offered to reimburse the  said purchases for the purchase  price respectively paid by them and his offer having been refused, the herein respondent Sixto de Jesus, as administrator and one of the heirs of the deceased, opposed the said motions on the  ground that  the  parcels of land which  were  the subject of  the sale  were mortgaged  to  the Philippine National Bank with  the approval of  the  court  and that there were other claims against the estate allowed by the committee on claims  for which said parcels of land might have to respond;  and, by  way of countermotion, prayed that should the sales be approved the  vendees be ordered to resell,  transfer, and  convey to him the interests purchased by them from his coheirs, by virtue of article 1067 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>The herein petitioners  as movants opposed the countermotion  on the  ground that the coheir  and countermovant Sixto de Jesus  had not offered to repurchase the  interests of the heirs they had bought within the  one-month period provided in said article 1067 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>After due hearing the respondent judge Modesto Castillo found that the offer to repurchase had been made within the period provided by the law and, sustaining the counter-motion, ordered the herein petitioners to resell and convey to the respondent Sixto  de Jesus the  respective interests bought by them upon  payment  of the purchase price and all the expenses of the sale.  A motion for reconsideration was subsequently filed by the petitioners, which was denied by the respondent Judge Daza on the ground that the order of Judge Castillo had become final at the time said motion was filed.</p>
<p>Thereupon the  petitioners brought the case to this Court by way of <em>certiorari</em> and <em>mandamus</em> to annul the order of Judge Castillo and to order the  Court of First Instance of Batangas to  approve their motions for subrogation.   The sole ground alleged as a basis  of the  petition is that the Court of First Instance of Batangas  as a probate court had no jurisdiction to entertain the countermotion of the respondent Sixto  de Jesus, contending that a separate action for subrogation under article 1067 of the Civil Code should be filed by the coheir Sixto de Jesus and should be decided by the court in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It seems that neither certiorari nor mandamus lies here and  that the proper remedy is appeal; but inasmuch as the respondents have not questioned the propriety of the remedy and  the  parties have submitted for  the decision of this Court  the  legal question of whether  or not the probate court has jurisdiction to entertain a  motion for subrogation under article 1067 of the Civil Code, we prefer, in the interest of justice, to decide that  question once and for all  instead of  dismissing the petition on procedural ground.</p>
<p>We have  looked  in vain in the memorandum for the petitioners for the citation of any rule of  court, statutory provision,  or applicable  authority  in  support of  their contention  that the probate court has no jurisdiction to authorize and order the subrogation mentioned  in article 1067 of the Civil Code.   The main function  of a probate court is to settle and liquidate  the  estates of  deceased persons either summarily or through the process of administration.  (<em>See</em> articles 74 to 91, inclusive, Rules of Court.) In order to settle the estate of a deceased person it is one of the functions of the probate court to determine who the heirs are that will receive the net assets  of the estate and the amount or proportion of their respective shares.  In the case at bar the petitioners, who are strangers, claimed the  right  to  be subrogated  to the  rights  of  the heirs .Demetrio,  Elena, and Maria  de Jesus by virtue of their purchase of the respective interests of the latter, while on the other hand the respondent Sixto de Jesus as a coheir claimed that same right  by virtue  of article 1067 of the Civil Code; and since at  the time these conflicting claims were presented to the court the estate of the deceased was still in  the process  of administration and  settlement,  it was incumbent upon the  probate court to adjudicate and settle said claims according to law.  If at the time the herein petitioners made the purchase in question the estate had been closed, although the partition of the parcels of land adjudicated to the heirs  had not been actually made, the contention  of the petitioners that the probate court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the claim for subrogation would have been tenable.   But that is not the case before us.  As a matter of fact the petitioners themselves invoked the authority of the probate court to pass upon their claim for subrogation for  the very reason that the property involved was under administration by the  court.</p>
<p>We find  that the probate court had jurisdiction to enter the order complained of, which we hereby affirm,  and deny the  petition with costs against the petitioners.</p>
