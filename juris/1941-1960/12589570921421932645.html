				<H3>NICANOR G.  SALAYSAY, ACTING MUNICIPAL MAYOR  OF SAN
JUAN DEL  MONTE,  RIZAL,  PETITIONER,  VS.  HONORABLE FRED RUIZ CASTRO, EXECUTIVE SECRETARY,  OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES, HONORABLE  WENCESLAO PASCUAL, PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR OF RIZAL,  AND  DOCTOR BRAULIO STO. DOMINGO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts in&nbsp; this case are not disputed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly stated, they are as follows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Engracio E. Santos is the duly elected Municipal&nbsp; Mayor of San Juan&nbsp; del&nbsp; Monte,&nbsp; Rizal, and the petitioner Nicanor&nbsp; G.&nbsp; Salaysay&nbsp; is&nbsp; the duly elected&nbsp; Vice- Mayor.&nbsp; In the month of September, 1955 and for some time prior thereto,&nbsp; Santos was under suspension from his office due to administrative charges filed against him and so petitioner Salaysay&nbsp; acted as Mayor under section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code providing that in case of temporary disability of the Mayor such as absence, etc., his duties shall be discharged&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Vice-Mayor.&nbsp; On September 8, 1955, while acting as Mayor,&nbsp; Salaysay filed his certificate of candidacy for the same office of Mayor. Interpreting said action of Salaysay in running for the office of Mayor&nbsp; as an automatic resignation from his office of Vice-Mayor&nbsp; under the provisions of&nbsp; section 27 of the Revised Election Code, as a&nbsp; consequence of which he no longer had authority to continue&nbsp; acting as&nbsp; Mayor,&nbsp; the Office of the President of the Philippines&nbsp; on&nbsp; September 12, 1955&nbsp; designated Braulio Sto. Domingo&nbsp; acting Municipal Vice-Mayor of&nbsp; Sail Juan del Monte, Rizal.&nbsp; On the same date Salaysay was&nbsp; advised by respondent Provincial&nbsp; Governor&nbsp; Wenceslao&nbsp; Pascual of&nbsp; Rizal that in view of his (Salaysay's) automatic cessation as Vice-Mayor due to his having filed his certificate&nbsp; of candidacy&nbsp; for the&nbsp; office of Mayor, and in&nbsp; view of the appointment&nbsp; of Sto. Domingo, as acting Vice-Mayor by the&nbsp; President of the&nbsp; Philippines, and because he (Pascual)&nbsp; had directed&nbsp; Sto. Domingo to assume the office of Mayor during the suspension of Mayor Santos, he (Salaysay) should turn over the office of Mayor to Sto. Domingo.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; September 13, 1955,&nbsp; Salaysay was also advised by Executive Secretary Fred Ruiz Castro to turn over the office&nbsp; of Mayor to Sto. Domingo immediately, otherwise he might be prosecuted for violation of Article 237 of the Revised Penal Code for prolonging performance of duties.<br><br>Salaysay refused to turn over. the office of Mayor to Sto. Domingo and&nbsp; brought this action of Prohibition&nbsp; with preliminary injunction against Executive&nbsp; Secretary Castro, Governor Pascual'&nbsp; and Sto. Domingo, to declare&nbsp; invalid, illegal and unauthorized&nbsp; the designation.of Sto. Domingo as acting Vice-Mayor of San&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; del Monte as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as his designation by&nbsp; Governor Pascual to assume the office of Mayor during the suspension of Mayor Santos; to order respondents to desist and refrain from molesting, interfering or in any way&nbsp; preventing petitioner from performing his duties as acting Municipal Mayor and prohibiting Sto. Domingo from&nbsp; performing or attempting to perform any of those powers and duties belonging to petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting upon&nbsp; a prayer contained in the petition, we issued a writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction. <br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; contends that his ease does not come&nbsp; under section 27 of the Election Code for&nbsp; the reason that when he filed his certificate of candidacy for the office of Mayor, he&nbsp; was&nbsp; actually holding&nbsp; said&nbsp; office.&nbsp; The&nbsp; respondents, however, maintain&nbsp; that the office&nbsp; petitioner was actually holding when he filed his certificate of candidacy&nbsp; for the office&nbsp; of Mayor was that of Vice-Mayor, the one to which he had been duly elected; that he was not actually holding the office of Mayor but merely&nbsp; discharging the duties thereof and was merely acting as&nbsp; Mayor during the temporary disability of the regular incumbent.&nbsp; Elaborating, respondents&nbsp; claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; Vice-Mayor acting as&nbsp; Mayor merely discharges&nbsp; the duties of the office but does&nbsp; not exercise the powers thereof;. that his tenure is provisional, lasting only during&nbsp; the temporary disability of the regular incumbent.&nbsp; Petitioner counters with&nbsp; the&nbsp; argument that a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor does not&nbsp; only&nbsp; discharge the duties&nbsp; of the office of Mayor&nbsp; but&nbsp; also&nbsp; exercises&nbsp; the powers thereof; and that while acting as Mayor, he&nbsp; actually holds the office of Mayor for all legal purposes.<br><br>It is clear that&nbsp; petitioner's stand is taken&nbsp; from&nbsp; the point&nbsp; of view&nbsp; of his&nbsp; acting&nbsp; as Mayor, and not&nbsp; of&nbsp; his office&nbsp; of&nbsp; Vice-Mayor, while respondents' position is taken from&nbsp; the point of view of petitioner actually holding the office&nbsp; of&nbsp; Vice-Mayor though incidentally and temporarily discharging the duties of the office of Mayor.<br><br>We have given the case considerable study and thought because we find no precedents to aid and guide us.&nbsp; The parties have ably adduced pertinent and extensive citations and arguments&nbsp; not only at the original&nbsp; hearing but also at the re-hearing.&nbsp; As to whether a&nbsp; Vice-Mayor&nbsp; acting as Mayor may be regarded&nbsp; as actually holding the office of Mayor, there are plausible arguments and good reasons for either side.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are inclined&nbsp; to agree with petitioner that one acting as Mayor not only discharges the duties of the office&nbsp; but also&nbsp; exercises the powers of&nbsp; said&nbsp; office, and that in one sense and literally, he&nbsp; may&nbsp; legitimately be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as actually&nbsp; holding the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of Mayor. But there&nbsp; is&nbsp; also&nbsp; force&nbsp; and&nbsp; logic&nbsp; in the argument&nbsp; of respondents that inasmuch&nbsp; as a&nbsp; Vice-Mayor&nbsp; takes&nbsp; over the duties of the Mayor only temporarily and in an acting capacity, he may not be regarded as actually holding the office, because the duly elected Mayor incumbent though actually&nbsp; under&nbsp; temporary disability such&nbsp; as&nbsp; suspension, illness or absence&nbsp; (section 2195,&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code)&nbsp; could and should be considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; retaining his right to the office of Mayor and actually holding the same; otherwise there would be a situation&nbsp; where two officials at the same time would be having&nbsp; a right to the same office and actually holding the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the possible uncertainty and doubt as to whether or not a Vice-Mayor by&nbsp; acting as Mayor can&nbsp; be regarded&nbsp; as actually holding said office of Mayor, we have to go back&nbsp; and resort to the legislative proceedings had, particularly the discussions and interpellations&nbsp; in-both houses&nbsp; of&nbsp; Congress leading to the enactment of section 27 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Election Code, with a view to ascertaining the&nbsp; intention of that&nbsp; body.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all,&nbsp; in interpreting a law,&nbsp; the primary consideration is the&nbsp; ascertainment of&nbsp; the intent&nbsp; and the purpose&nbsp; of the legislature promulgating&nbsp; the same.<br><blockquote>"Statute law&nbsp; is the&nbsp; will of&nbsp; the legislature;&nbsp; find&nbsp; the object of all&nbsp; judicial interpretation&nbsp; of it&nbsp; is to&nbsp; determine what intention is conveyed,&nbsp; either expressly or By implication,&nbsp; by the language used, so far as it&nbsp; is necessary for determining whether the particular case or state of facts presented to the interpreter falls within it." (Black, Handbook on the Construction&nbsp; and Interpretation of&nbsp; the Laws, 2nd ed., p.&nbsp; 11.)<br></blockquote><center><i>HISTORY OR&nbsp; BACKGROUND OF SECTION 27 <br>REVISED ELECTION CODE</i><br></center><br>Before the&nbsp; enactment of section 27 of the Revised Election&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; the law in force&nbsp; covering&nbsp; the point or question in controversy was section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its burden was to allow an elective&nbsp; provincial, municipal, or city official such as Mayor, running for the same office to continue in office until the expiration of&nbsp; his term.&nbsp; The legislative intention&nbsp; as we see it was "to favor re-election,of the incumbent by allowing him to continue in his office and use&nbsp; the&nbsp; prerogatives and influence thereof in his campaign for re-election and to avoid&nbsp; a break in or interruption of his incumbency&nbsp; during&nbsp; his current term and provide for continuity thereof with the next&nbsp; term of office if&nbsp; re-elected.<br><br>But section 2, Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 666 had reference only to provincial&nbsp; and municipal officials duly elected to their&nbsp; offices and who were occupying&nbsp; the same by reason of said election&nbsp; at the time that they filed their&nbsp; certificates of candidacy for the same position.' It did not include officials who hold or&nbsp; occupy elective provincial and municipal offices not by election but by appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote section&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 666:<br><blockquote>"Any elective provincial, municipal or city official&nbsp; running&nbsp; for an office other than the one for which&nbsp; he has been lastly elected, shall be considered resigned from his office from&nbsp; the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy,"<br></blockquote>However, this was exactly the situation&nbsp; facing the Legislature in&nbsp; the year 1947 after the late President&nbsp; Roxas had assumed office as President and before the elections coming up that&nbsp; year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; last national elections for provincial and&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; officials&nbsp; were held&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1940,&nbsp; those elected therein to serve up&nbsp; to&nbsp; December, 1943.&nbsp; Because of the war and&nbsp; the occupation by the Japanese, no&nbsp; elections for provincial&nbsp; and municipal officials could be held in 1943. Those elected in 1940 could not hold-over beyond 1943 after the expiration of their term of office because according to the views of the Executive department as later confirmed by this Court in the case of Topacio Nueno <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Angeles, 76 Phil., 12, through Commonwealth Act No. 357, Congress had intended to; suppress the doctrine or rule of hold-over. So, those provincial and municipal officials elected in 1940 ceased in 1943&nbsp; and&nbsp; their offices&nbsp; became vacant, and&nbsp; this was the situation when after liberation,&nbsp; President Osmefia , took&nbsp; over&nbsp; as&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; Executive.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; filled&nbsp; these&nbsp; vacant positions by appointment.&nbsp;&nbsp; When President&nbsp; Roxas&nbsp; was elected&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1946 and&nbsp; assumed office in&nbsp; 1947 he replaced many&nbsp; of these Osmefia&nbsp; appointees&nbsp; with his&nbsp; own&nbsp; men. Naturally,&nbsp; his&nbsp; Liberal Party followers&nbsp; wanted to extend to these appointees the&nbsp; same privilege of office retention thereto given by section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666 to local&nbsp; elective&nbsp; officials.&nbsp; It could&nbsp; not be&nbsp; done because section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666 had reference only to officials&nbsp; who had been elected.&nbsp; So, it was decided by President Roxas and his party, to amend said section 2, Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 666 by&nbsp; substituting the&nbsp; phrase "which he&nbsp; is actually holding", for the phrase "for which he has been lastly elected" found in&nbsp; section 2 of Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 666.&nbsp; The amendment&nbsp; is&nbsp; now&nbsp; found in section&nbsp; 27&nbsp; of the Revised Election&nbsp; Code which we quote&nbsp; below:<br><br>"SEC. 27. Candidate holding office.—Any elective provincial municipal, or city official&nbsp; running for an office, other than one which he is actually holding, shall be&nbsp; considered resigned his office from the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy."<br><br>The purpose of the Legislature in making the&nbsp; amendment, in our opinion, was to give the benefit or privilege of retaining office not only to those who have been elected thereto but also to those who have been appointed; stated differently,&nbsp; to&nbsp; extend the&nbsp; privilege and benefit&nbsp; to&nbsp; the regular incumbents having the right and title to the office either by election or by&nbsp; appointment.&nbsp; There can&nbsp; be no doubt, in our opinion,&nbsp; about&nbsp; this intention.&nbsp; We&nbsp; have carefully examined the proceedings in both Houses of the Legislature.&nbsp; The minority Nacionalista members of Congress bitterly attacked this amendment,&nbsp; realizing that&nbsp; it was partisan legislation intended to favor those officials appointed by President Roxas; but despite their opposition the amendment was passed. „<br><center><br><i>LEGISLATIVE INTENT</i><br></center><br>We repeat that the purpose of the Legislature in enacting section 27 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Election Code&nbsp; was to allow an official to continue occupying an elective provincial, municipal or&nbsp; city office to which he had been appointed or elected, while campaigning for&nbsp; his election as long as he runs&nbsp; for the same office.&nbsp;&nbsp; He may keep said office continuously without any break,&nbsp; through the elections and up to the expiration of the term of&nbsp; the&nbsp; office.&nbsp; By continuing in office, the office holder was allowed&nbsp; and expected to use the prerogatives, authority and&nbsp; influence of&nbsp; his&nbsp; office in his campaign for his election or re-election to the office he was holding.&nbsp; Another intention of the Legislature&nbsp; as we have&nbsp; hitherto adverted to&nbsp; was&nbsp; to provide&nbsp; for&nbsp; continuity of his incumbency so that there would be no interruption or break, which would happen if he were required to resign because of his filing his certificate of candidacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing this intention of the Legislature in this&nbsp; regard in mind, can it be said that a Vice-Mayor like the petitioner herein, merely acting as Mayor because of the temporary disability of the regular incumbent,&nbsp; comes under the provision and 1 exception of section 27 of the Election Code?&nbsp; The answer must necessarily be in the negative.&nbsp; A Vice-Mayor acts as Mayor only in a temporary, provisional capacity.&nbsp; This tenure is indefinite,&nbsp; uncertain&nbsp; and precarious.&nbsp; He may act for a few days, for a week or a month or even longer. But surely there, ordinarily, is no assurance or expectation that he could continue acting as Mayor, long, indefinitely, through the&nbsp; elections&nbsp; and up to the end of&nbsp; the&nbsp; term of the office because the temporary disability of the regular, incumbent Mayor may end any time and he&nbsp; may resume his duties.<br><center><br><i>VICE-MAYOR ACTING AS MAYOR, OUTSIDE <br>LEGAL CONTEMPLATION</i><br></center><br>The case of a Vice-Mayor acting&nbsp; as Mayor could not have been&nbsp; within the contemplation and the intent of the Legislature because as we have already stated, that law- making&nbsp; body or at least&nbsp; the majority thereof&nbsp; intended to give the benefits and the privilege of section 27 to those officials holding their offices&nbsp; by&nbsp; their own right and&nbsp; by a valid title either by election or by appointment, permanently continuously&nbsp; and up to the end of the term of the office, not to an official neither elected nor appointed to that&nbsp; office but merely acting provisionally in said office because of the temporary&nbsp; disability of the&nbsp; regular incumbent.&nbsp;&nbsp; In drafting and enacting section 27, how could the Legislature&nbsp; have possibly had in mind a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor, and include him&nbsp; in its scope, and accord&nbsp; him the benefits of retaining the office&nbsp; of Mayor and utilizing its authority and influence in his election campaign, when his tenure in the office&nbsp; of Mayor is so&nbsp; uncertain,&nbsp; indefinite and precarious that&nbsp; there may be no opportunity or&nbsp; occasion for him to enjoy said benefits; and how&nbsp; could Congress&nbsp; have contemplated his continuing in&nbsp; the office in&nbsp; which he is acting, when the very idea of continuity is necessarily in conflict and incompatible with the uncertainty, precariousness&nbsp; and temporary character of his&nbsp; tenure&nbsp; in the&nbsp; office of Mayor?<br><center><br><i>"ACTUALLY HOLDING OFFICE"&nbsp; EQUIVALENT <br>TO "INCUMBENT"</i><br></center><br>All these doubts about the meaning and application of the&nbsp; phrase "actually holding office"&nbsp; could perhaps&nbsp; have been avoided had the&nbsp; intention of this Legislature&nbsp; been phrased differently.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could perhaps&nbsp; have more happily used the term "incumbent" to refer to those provincial and&nbsp; municipal officials who&nbsp; were holding office&nbsp; either by election or by appointment,&nbsp; and so had&nbsp; a&nbsp; legal title and right thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, this term "incumbent" was&nbsp; actually&nbsp; used by Congressman Laurel in explaining the idea of the committee that drafted this amendment to section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 666, of which committee he was the&nbsp; Chairman.&nbsp; The&nbsp; deliberations&nbsp; of the lower House&nbsp; as quoted by the very counsel for petitioner reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Mr. Roy. What must be&nbsp; the reason,&nbsp; then, Mr. Chairman of the Committee for deleting the words 'has been lastly elected'? "Mr. Laurel.&nbsp; The idea is to cover the present incumbents of the local&nbsp; offices."&nbsp; (II Congressional&nbsp; Record&nbsp; 1143.)<br></blockquote>In this&nbsp; connection, a happier phraseology of another portion&nbsp; of section 27 could have been used for&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of precision.&nbsp; For instance, the first part of said section reads thus: "Any elective&nbsp; provincial, municipal&nbsp; or city official running for an office", and&nbsp; yet as we have&nbsp; already said, the Legislature intended said section to refer to officials who were appointed&nbsp; by President&nbsp; Roxas to&nbsp; fill vacancies in provincial,&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; and city elective offices. In other words,&nbsp; those&nbsp; officials were&nbsp; not really elected or elective officials but they were officials occupying or holding&nbsp; local elective offices by&nbsp; appointment.&nbsp; All this goes&nbsp; to&nbsp; show that we should not&nbsp; and cannot always&nbsp; be bound by the phraseology or literal meaning&nbsp; of a law&nbsp; or statute&nbsp; but at times may interpret, nay,&nbsp; even disregard&nbsp; loose or inaccurate wording in&nbsp; order to arrive&nbsp; at&nbsp; the real meaning and&nbsp; spirit of a statute&nbsp; intended and breathed into&nbsp; it by the law-making body.<br><blockquote><i><center>MEANING OF PHRASE "RESIGNED FROM HIS OFFICE"<br></center></i></blockquote>Section 27&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 180 in&nbsp; providing that a local elective official running for&nbsp; an office other than the one&nbsp; he is&nbsp; actually holding, is considered&nbsp; resigned from his office, must necessarily&nbsp; refer&nbsp; to&nbsp; an office which said official can resign, or from which he could be considered resigned, even against his will.&nbsp; For instance, an incumbent Mayor running for the office of Provincial&nbsp; Governor must be considered as having resigned from his office of Mayor.&nbsp; He&nbsp; must resign voluntarily or&nbsp; be compelled to resign.&nbsp; It has to be an office which is subject to resignation by the one occupying&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Can&nbsp; we say this of a Vice-Mayor, acting as Mayor? Can he&nbsp; or could he resign from the office of Mayor or could he be&nbsp; made&nbsp; to resign therefrom?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; As long as&nbsp; he holds&nbsp; the office of Vice- Mayor to which he has a right and legal title, he, cannot resign or be made to&nbsp; resign from the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of Mayor because the law itself requires that as Vice-Mayor he must act as Mayor during the temporary disability of the regular or incumbent Mayor. If he cannot voluntarily resign the office of&nbsp; Mayor in which he is&nbsp; acting temporarily, or could not be made&nbsp; to resign therefrom, then the provision of section 27 of the Code about&nbsp; resignation,&nbsp; to him, would be useless, futile and a dead letter.&nbsp; In interpreting a law, we should always avoid a construction that would have this result, for it&nbsp; would violate the fundamental&nbsp; rule that every legislative act should be interpreted in order to give force and effect to every provision&nbsp; thereof because the Legislature is&nbsp; not presumed to have done a useless act.<br><blockquote>"A statute is&nbsp; a solemn enactment of the&nbsp; state acting through its legislature&nbsp; and it muat be assumed that this&nbsp; process achieve result.&nbsp; It cannot the presumed that the legislature would&nbsp; d futile thing."&nbsp; (Sutherland, Statutory Construction,&nbsp; Vol. 8, p.&nbsp; 237.)<br></blockquote><center><i>EXAMPLE</i><br></center><br>To emphasize and illustrate this inapplicability of section 27 to a&nbsp; Vice-Mayor acting as&nbsp; Mayor, let us consider an&nbsp; example.&nbsp;&nbsp; A Vice-Mayor&nbsp; while acting as Mayor files his certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; candidacy for the office of Vice-Mayor. In&nbsp; other words,&nbsp; he wants to&nbsp; run for&nbsp; re-election.&nbsp; The Provincial Governor, especially if belonging to a&nbsp; different political party wants&nbsp; to keep&nbsp; him out&nbsp; of the&nbsp; office of Mayor, especially during the electoral campaign, and instead have his party man, the councilor who obtained the highest number of votes in the last elections, act as Mayor (section&nbsp; 2195,&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code).&nbsp; So, he hastens to the Municipal&nbsp; building and enters the Mayor's office where the Vice-Mayor has installed himself.&nbsp; Using the same argument&nbsp; of herein petitioner, he tells&nbsp; the Vice- Mayor that inasmuch as while acting as&nbsp; Mayor, he was "actually holding" said office of Mayor, and because while thus holding it, he filed his certificate of candidacy for Vice-Mayor which is&nbsp; a different office, he must be considered resigned from; the&nbsp; office of&nbsp; Mayor; and he even asks him to leave the Mayor's room and office.&nbsp; The Vice- Mayor, a law&nbsp; abiding citizen&nbsp; acquiesces&nbsp; and obeys,&nbsp; he reluctantly,&nbsp; leaves and abandons the office of the Mayor and repairs to his own room as Vice-Mayor.&nbsp; But he has a happy inspiration and&nbsp; remembers the law (section 2195, Revised Administrative Code); he rushes back to the office of the Mayor and tells the&nbsp; Governor and the authorities that he is&nbsp; still&nbsp; the&nbsp; Vice-Mayor because when&nbsp; he filed his certificate of candidacy for Vice-Mayor, he was also actually holding said office,&nbsp; and&nbsp; so&nbsp; did not&nbsp; lose&nbsp; it; that as such Vice-Mayor, he can&nbsp; act and must act as Mayor during the temporary disability of the&nbsp; incumbent, because he cannot resign and no one can make him resign from the office of Mayor; and he defies the Governor to oust him from the office and room of&nbsp; the Mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Governor is helpless for the Vice-Mayor&nbsp; is right, that is, if we apply section 27 of the Election Code to&nbsp; him.&nbsp; This&nbsp; possible,&nbsp; undesirable and anomalous situation&nbsp; is another reason&nbsp; why section 27 may not be applied to the case of a Vice-Mayor&nbsp; acting as Mayor.<br><br>In the above&nbsp; given example, the Governor might contend that when the Vice-Mayor filed his certificate of candidacy for Mayor, he was actually holding only the office of Mayor and not that of Vice-Mayor and so he lost his office of Vice- Mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that contention of the Governor is untenable. Even counsel for herein petitioner in his memorandum admits&nbsp; that a Vice-Mayor&nbsp; while acting&nbsp; as Mayor,&nbsp; also actually holds his office of Vice-Mayor.&nbsp; And it has to be that way.&nbsp; A Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor does not cease to be Vice-Mayor.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; that is his real, principal and basic office or function.&nbsp; Acting as Mayor is only an incident, an accessory.&nbsp; Let him cease holding the office of Vice-Mayor even for an instant, and he automatically, also ceases acting as Mayor.&nbsp; Furthermore, a Vice-Mayor has administrative duties to perform.&nbsp; He&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; ex-officio member of the Municipal Council and he is in charge of the barrio or district where the town offices are. located (section 2204, Revised Administrative Code).&nbsp; While acting as Mayor he may not say that he ceases to hold the office of Vice-Mayor and so cannot look after the needs of the residents&nbsp; of his&nbsp; district and present&nbsp; them&nbsp; to the town council.<br><center><br><i>ANOTHER EXAMPLE</i><br></center><br>The&nbsp; regular incumbent&nbsp; Mayor files his certificate of candidacy for the same office of Mayor.&nbsp; Then he goes on leave of absence or falla sick and the&nbsp; Vice-Mayor acts in his place,&nbsp; and while thus, acting he also files his certificate of candidacy for the same office of Mayor.&nbsp; Then the Vice- Mayor also goes on leave or&nbsp; falls sick or is suspended,, and because the regular Mayor is still unable to return to office, under section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code, the councilor who at the last general elections received the highest number of votes, acts as Mayor, and&nbsp; while thus acting he&nbsp; also files his certificate of candidacy&nbsp; for the office of Mayor.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Vice-Mayor also campaigns for the same post of Mayor claiming like the herein petitioner that he did not, lose&nbsp; Ms office of Vice-Mayor&nbsp; because he filed his certificate of candidacy while acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; Mayor and thus was actually holding the office of Mayor.&nbsp; Using the same argument, the councilor who had previously acted as Mayor also campaigns for his election to the same post of Mayor while keeping his position as councilor.&nbsp; Thus we would have this singular situation&nbsp; of three municipal officials occupying three separate and distinct offices,&nbsp; running&nbsp; for the&nbsp; same&nbsp; office&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mayor,&nbsp; yet&nbsp; keeping&nbsp; their different respective offices, and strangely enough two&nbsp; of those offices (Vice-Mayor and Councilor) are different from the office of&nbsp; Mayor they&nbsp; are running for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could&nbsp; that situation have&nbsp; been contemplated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Legislature&nbsp; in enacting section 27 of the Revised Election Code?&nbsp; We&nbsp; do not think so, and yet that would happen if the&nbsp; contention of the petitioner about the meaning of "actually&nbsp; holding office" is to prevail.<br><center><br><i>CONGRESS CONTEMPLATED ONLY ONE OFFICE <br>ACTUALITY HELD</i><br></center><br>Another argument against the contention that&nbsp; a&nbsp; Vice- Mayor acting as Mayor actually holds the office of&nbsp; Mayor, occurs to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; For purposes of ready reference we again quote section 27 in its&nbsp; entirety:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 27. <i>Candidate holding office</i>.—Any elective&nbsp; provincial, municipal, or city official running for an&nbsp; office, other than the one which&nbsp; he is actually holding, shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered resigned&nbsp; from his office from the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy."<br></blockquote>It will readily be noticed from the quoted section, especially the words underlined by us that the Legislature contemplated only one office,&nbsp; not two or more.&nbsp; To us, this&nbsp; is significant&nbsp; as well&nbsp; as important.&nbsp; As&nbsp; we have&nbsp; previously stated, there is no question that a Vice-Mayor acting&nbsp; as Mayor still&nbsp; holds&nbsp; the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of Vice-Mayor.&nbsp; Petitioner himself admits this&nbsp; in his written&nbsp; argument and&nbsp; even contends that&nbsp; there is nothing&nbsp; wrong or illegal in an official holding two offices at the same time provided&nbsp; there is no incompatibility between them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; Legislature believed that a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor actually&nbsp; holds the office of Mayor and that he would thus be actually holding two offices, then it would have provided in section 27 for offices ill the plural instead of employing the words office, his office, and the one which it used in the singular.<br><br>Besides this clear expression of legislative intent for only one office being actually held and to be resigned from, to say that the Vice-Mayor when' acting as Mayor is actually holding two offices would create confusion and uncertainty because we would&nbsp; not know which&nbsp; office&nbsp; he&nbsp; would&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; resigned from.<br><br><i></i><center><i> TWO OFFICIALS "ACTUALLY HOLDING" THE SAME<br>ELECTIVE OFFICE</i> </center><br>We have already said that a Mayor under temporary&nbsp; . disability&nbsp; continues to be Mayor&nbsp; (Gamalinda&nbsp; <i>vs. </i>Yap<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> No. L-6121,&nbsp; May&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1953)&nbsp; and actually holds the office despite&nbsp; his temporary disability to discharge the duties of the office; he receives full&nbsp; salary corresponding to his office, which payment may not be (legal if&nbsp; he were not actually holding the office, while the Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor does not receive said salary but is paid only a sum equivalent&nbsp; to it&nbsp;&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 2187,&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code).&nbsp; Now, if a Mayor&nbsp; under temporary&nbsp; disability&nbsp; actually holds the office&nbsp; of Mayor and the Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to his claim ia also actually holding the office of Mayor, then we would have the anomalous and embarrassing situation of two officials actually holding the very same&nbsp; local elective office.&nbsp; Considered from this view, point, and&nbsp; to avoid the anomaly, it ia to us&nbsp; clear that the Vice-Mayor should not be regarded as holding the office of Mayor but merely&nbsp; acting for the regular incumbent, a duty or right as an&nbsp; incident to&nbsp; his office&nbsp; of Vice-Mayor and not as an independent right or&nbsp; absolute title to the office by reason of election or appointment.<br><br><center><i>ACTING MAYOR AND&nbsp; ACTING AS MAYOR, DISTINGUISHED</i><br></center><br>Petitioner claims that he&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; acting Mayor,&nbsp; Respondents insist that petitioner is merely acting as Mayor.<br><br>It is pertinent and profitable, at least&nbsp; in the present case, to make a distinction between&nbsp; an Acting&nbsp; Mayor and a , Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor.&nbsp; "When a&nbsp; vacancy&nbsp; occurs in&nbsp; the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mayor, the&nbsp; Provincial Governor under section 21 (a)&nbsp; or the President under section 21(6),&nbsp; (d) and&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; of the Election Code appoints&nbsp; or designates an Acting Mayor.&nbsp; In&nbsp; that&nbsp; case the person&nbsp; designated or&nbsp; appointed becomes the Mayor and actually holds the office for the unexpired term of the office&nbsp; (section 21 [<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>]) because when he was appointed there was no regular incumbent to the office.&nbsp; However, when a Vice-Mayor&nbsp; acts as Mayor, there is&nbsp; no vacancy&nbsp; in the&nbsp; post&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mayor.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; a regular incumbent&nbsp; Mayor only that the latter is under temporary disability.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; strictly and correctly speaking, the Vice-Mayor may not be considered Acting Mayor.&nbsp; He is&nbsp; only acting as Mayor&nbsp; temporarily, provisionally&nbsp; and during the temporary disability of&nbsp; the regular&nbsp; incumbent. He is not the incumbent.&nbsp;&nbsp; In baseball parlance, petitioner is only a&nbsp; "pinch hitter",—pinch hitting for, say, the pitcher in an emergency.&nbsp; As a&nbsp; mere pinch hitter his name does not grace the regular line up, he&nbsp; is not the pitcher, does not hold the position of pitcher, neither does he receive all the benefits and privileges of the&nbsp; regular pitcher. Ordinarily,&nbsp; this apparently fine and&nbsp; subtle distinction would seem unimportant and unnecessary.&nbsp; When a Vice- Mayor acts as Mayor we usually call him Mayor or Acting Mayor and deal with him&nbsp; as though he were the regular incumbent;&nbsp; but there are times&nbsp; and occasions&nbsp; like the present when it is necessary&nbsp; to make these distinction and use&nbsp; correct and&nbsp; precise&nbsp; language&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to determine whether&nbsp; or not&nbsp; under section 27 of the&nbsp; Election&nbsp; Code a Vice Mayor acting as&nbsp; Mayor like the petitioner herein comes within the phrase "actually holding office" used in that section.<br><i><center><br>EXCEPTION TO BE CONSTRUED STRICTLY<br></center></i><br>Section 26&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Election Code&nbsp; provides that every person&nbsp; holding an appointive office shall <i>ipso&nbsp; facto</i> cease in his office&nbsp; on the date he files his certificate of candidacy.&nbsp; Then we have section 27 of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Code as well as section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 666 which it&nbsp; amended, both providing that local elective officials running for&nbsp; office&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; resigned&nbsp; from&nbsp; their posts, except when&nbsp; they run for the same&nbsp; office&nbsp; they are occupying or holding.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is evident that the general rule is that&nbsp; all Government officials&nbsp; running for&nbsp; office&nbsp; must resign.&nbsp; The authority or&nbsp; privilege to&nbsp; keep&nbsp; one's&nbsp; office when running for the same office is the&nbsp; exception.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is a settled rule of statutory&nbsp; construction that an exception or&nbsp; a proviso&nbsp; must be strictly&nbsp; construed specially&nbsp; when considered in an attempt to ascertain the legislative intent.<br><blockquote>"Exceptions, as&nbsp; a general rule, should be strictly, but reasonably construed; they extend only so far as their language fairly warrants, and all doubts&nbsp; should be resolved in favor of the&nbsp; general provision rather than the exception. Where. a general rule&nbsp; is established&nbsp; by statute with exceptions, the court will not&nbsp; curtail the former nor add to the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; by implication,&nbsp; and&nbsp; it is a general rule that&nbsp; an express exception&nbsp; excludes all others,&nbsp; although it ,is&nbsp; always&nbsp; proper in determining&nbsp; the applicability of this rule, to&nbsp; inquire whether,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; particular case, it accords&nbsp; with reason and justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *." (Francisco, Statutory Construction, p. 304, citing&nbsp; 69&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; section 643,&nbsp; pp. 1092-1093; Italics supplied.)<br><br>"As in&nbsp; all other&nbsp; cases, a proviso should be interpreted consistently with the&nbsp; legislative intent.&nbsp; Where the proviso&nbsp; itself&nbsp; must be considered.&nbsp; In an attempt to determine the&nbsp; intent of the Legislature it should&nbsp; be strictly construed.&nbsp; This is true because the&nbsp; legislative purpose set forth&nbsp; in the general enactment expresses the&nbsp; legislative policy and only those&nbsp; subjects&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; exempted by the proviso should be freed from&nbsp; the operation of the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sutherland, Statutory Construction, 3rd ed., Vol. 2, pp. 471-472.)<br></blockquote>Applying this rule, inasmuch as petitioner herein claimed the&nbsp; right&nbsp; to&nbsp; retain&nbsp; his office under the&nbsp; exception&nbsp; above referred to,&nbsp; said claim must have to be judged strictly,— whether or not&nbsp; his mere acting in the office&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mayor may be legally&nbsp; interpreted as actually holding the same so&nbsp; as&nbsp; to come within the exception. As we have already observed, literally and generally&nbsp; speaking, since he is discharging the duties and exercising the powers of the office of Mayor he might be regarded as actually holding the office; but strictly speaking and considering&nbsp; the purpose and intention&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Legislature&nbsp; behind section 27 of the&nbsp; Revised Election Code, he may not and&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; legitimately be considered as actually holding the office of Mayor.<br><center><br><i>RETENTION OF OFFICE</i><br></center><br>We have, heretofore discussed the case as regards the resignation of an office holder&nbsp; from his office by reason of his running for an&nbsp; office different from&nbsp; it; and&nbsp; our conclusion is that it must be an office that he can or may resign or be considered&nbsp; resigned from; and that the office of Mayor is not such an office from the&nbsp; stand point of a Vice-Mayor.&nbsp; Let us now consider the case from the point of view of retaining his office because he is&nbsp; running for the same office, namely—retention&nbsp; of his offidej... As we have&nbsp; already said, the&nbsp; Legislature&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; allow&nbsp; an office holder and incumbent to retain&nbsp; his office provided that he runs for&nbsp; the same.&nbsp; In&nbsp; other words, he&nbsp; is&nbsp; supposed to retain the office before&nbsp; and throughout&nbsp; the elections and up to the expiration of the&nbsp; term of the office, without interruption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can a Vice-Mayor acting&nbsp; as Mayor.be&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; or expected to retain the office&nbsp; of Mayor?&nbsp; The incumbent Mayor running, for the same office&nbsp; can and has a right to keep and retain said&nbsp; office up to the end of his term.&nbsp; But a Vice-Mayor merely acting as&nbsp; Mayor and running for&nbsp; said office of&nbsp; Mayor,&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; and&nbsp; cannot be expected to keep the office up to the&nbsp; end of the term, even assuming that&nbsp; by acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; Mayor he&nbsp; is&nbsp; actually holding the office of Mayor, for the simple&nbsp; reason that his holding of the same is temporary,&nbsp; provisional and precarious&nbsp; and may end any time when the incumbent Mayor returns to duty.&nbsp; Naturally,&nbsp; his temporary holding of the office of Mayor cannot be the retention or right to keep the office&nbsp; intended by&nbsp; the Legislature in section&nbsp; 27 of Republic Act No. 180.&nbsp; So that, neither from&nbsp; the point of view of resignation from the office of Mayor nor the standpoint&nbsp; of retention&nbsp; of said office,&nbsp; may a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor, like herein petitioner,&nbsp; come within the provisions and meaning of section 27 of the Election Code, particularly the exception m it.<br><i><center><br>SUPPOSED DISCRIMINATION AGAINST VICE-MAYOR <br>ACTING AS MAYOR<br></center></i><br>During the hearing and oral argument of this case, the suggestion&nbsp; was made, which&nbsp; suggestion was also used as an&nbsp; argument during the deliberations among the members of this Tribunal, that to include in section 27 particularly the phrase&nbsp; "actually&nbsp; holding office"&nbsp; one who has&nbsp; been appointed as acting official such as Acting Mayor and at the same time exclude a Vice-Mayor who acts&nbsp; as Mayor, would be discriminating&nbsp; against an official&nbsp; (Vice-Mayor) who by&nbsp; statutory provision&nbsp; and&nbsp; sanction is required to act as Mayor, and give&nbsp; more importance to one&nbsp; merely appointed to said office.&nbsp; We fail to see any discrimination for the reason that an appointee to the office of Mayor fills a vacancy&nbsp; and serves&nbsp; until&nbsp; the end&nbsp; of the&nbsp; term of&nbsp; the&nbsp; office,&nbsp; whereas&nbsp; a Vice-Mayor acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; Mayor fills no vacancy because there is none and he serves only temporarily until the disability of the incumbent, such as suspension, absence, illness, etc. is removed.&nbsp; Now, if&nbsp; a vacancy&nbsp; is created in the office&nbsp; of Mayor by removal, resignation, death or cessation of the incumbent, then the Vice-Mayor automatically fills the vacancy, becomes Mayor (section 2195, Revised Administrative Code),&nbsp; and serves until the end of the term (section 21[/], Revised Election Code).&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the time when he may invoke&nbsp; section 27 because he would then be actually holding the office of Mayor.<br><center><br><i>CONCLUSION</i><br></center><br>In&nbsp; conclusion, we believe and hold that a Vice-Mayor . acting as Mayor&nbsp; does not "actually&nbsp; hold the office" of Mayor within the meaning of section 27 of Republic Act No. 180; that a Vice-Mayor who files his certificate of candidacy for the office of Mayor, even while acting as Mayor, is considered resigned from the office&nbsp; of Vice-Mayor for the reason that that&nbsp; is the only&nbsp; office that he "actually holds" within the contemplation&nbsp; of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 27 of the Revised&nbsp; Election Code and the office&nbsp; he is running for (Mayor)&nbsp; is naturally other than the&nbsp; one he is actually holding&nbsp; (Vice-Mayor); and that having&nbsp; ceased&nbsp; to be a Vice-Mayor, he automatically lost all right to act as Mayor.<br><br>A word of explanation.&nbsp; This decision should have been promulgated long before now.&nbsp; In truth, this Tribunal was anxious&nbsp; and determined&nbsp; to decide this case before&nbsp; the last&nbsp; November elections, at least before the newly elected local officials assumed office.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after long, careful deliberations the court was deadlocked, the vote&nbsp; standing five&nbsp; to five.. The&nbsp; rehearing&nbsp; ordered by us as decreed by ., law&nbsp; failed to break the deadlock.&nbsp; It was only when the new addition to&nbsp; the membership&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Tribunal,&nbsp; Mr. Justice Endencia studied the case, weighed the arguments and&nbsp; considered the authorities on either side, that the tie vote could be broken.&nbsp; He voted for and signed the .present opinion which now becomes the majority opinion.<br><br>The question involved in the present case may in a way be regarded as moot.&nbsp; Just the same, we doomed it advisable to proceed with&nbsp; its final determination, even elaborate on the discussion&nbsp; of&nbsp; its different aspects, by reason of its importance and for the information and guidance of&nbsp; local elective&nbsp; officials, and perchance so that&nbsp; the Legislature, apprised of the judicial interpretation and meaning given to section 27 of the Revised Election Code, may be&nbsp; in&nbsp; a better position&nbsp; to decide whether to&nbsp; continue and leave it as it stands on the statute books, or amend or change it before the next general elections.<br><br>In view of the foregoing the petition for prohibition is denied, with&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; The writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued&nbsp; is hereby dissolved.<br><br><i>Padilla, Jugo, Labrador</i>, and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i>CONCURRING:</i><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">REYES, A., J.;</span><br><br>The chief function of statutory construction is to ascertain the intention of the lawmaker and, that&nbsp; intention has been ascertained, to give effect thereto.&nbsp; By reference to legislative record&nbsp; Mr. Justice Montemayor has, I think, arrived&nbsp; at the true legislative intent and has therefore fashioned his&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; so as to give effect to that intent.

That conclusion would only be true if the law required the candidate&nbsp; to resign voluntarily from his office. But the law does not&nbsp; require him to resign; it considers him resigned, treats him as if he had resigned;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that is altogether&nbsp; a different&nbsp; thing. In order that an&nbsp; official&nbsp; can be&nbsp; considered resigned&nbsp; all that is needed is that the&nbsp; office be&nbsp; one that he&nbsp; could forfeit or&nbsp; loss. And the mayoralty is certainly an&nbsp; office that can be lost&nbsp; or forfeited by petitioner,&nbsp; even if he&nbsp; could not resign from it.&nbsp; The trouble, I suppose, is that the structure of our language is such&nbsp; that&nbsp; (as semanticists have&nbsp; pointed out)&nbsp; it enables us&nbsp; not only to use words about realities&nbsp; but&nbsp; also to use words about words. And it is&nbsp; precisely&nbsp; because the law here involved decrees&nbsp; a forfeiture&nbsp; that restrictive interpretation&nbsp; becomes imperative&nbsp; and&nbsp; doubts&nbsp; should be&nbsp; resolved against the petitioner's forfeiting&nbsp; his office.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><center><br><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING:</span><br></center><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCEPCION, J.;</span><br><br>This case&nbsp; hinges on&nbsp; the interpretation of section 27&nbsp; of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 180&nbsp; (Revised Election Code), reading:<br><blockquote>"Any elective provincial, municipal, or city official running for an office, other than the one which he is&nbsp; actually holding, shall&nbsp; be considered resigned from his&nbsp; office from the moment of the filing o£ his certificate of candidacy."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>The main&nbsp; issue is whether petitioner Nicanor G.

(Italics supplied.).<br></blockquote>Hence,&nbsp; "actually"&nbsp; means&nbsp; "in&nbsp; act&nbsp; or fact; in&nbsp; reality; truly as, he was actually there."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Funk &amp; Wagnalls, New Standard Dictionary, 1952 ed.,&nbsp; p. 31.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; other words, actually, "is opposed to seemingly, pretendedly, or f eignedly as actually engaged in farming means <i>really, truly, in fact.</i> (In re Strawbridge&nbsp; &amp; Mays,&nbsp; 39&nbsp; Ala.&nbsp; 367)"&nbsp; (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 3rd&nbsp; ed., p. 130.)<br><br>Upon the other hand, to "hold"&nbsp; is "to possess; to occupy; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; in possession&nbsp; and&nbsp; administration&nbsp; of; as&nbsp; to hold office."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Black's Law Dictionary, p. 897.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, to&nbsp; "actually hold" is&nbsp; to possess in fact or in reality, that is to say, physically&nbsp; or materially.<br><br>A public&nbsp; office, however, "is the&nbsp; right, authority&nbsp; and duty, created and conferred by law, by which for a given period either fixed&nbsp; by law&nbsp; or induring at the pleasure of the creating power,&nbsp; an&nbsp; individual is invested with&nbsp; some portion of the&nbsp; sovereign functions of the government, to be&nbsp; exercised by him&nbsp; for the benefit of the public." (Mechem, Public Officers, section&nbsp; 1.)&nbsp; Being intangible, it is incapable, of physical or material&nbsp; occupation.&nbsp; As a consequence, the actually holding of an office is. determined by its physical, external or tangible manifestations,&nbsp; namely, the exercise of the powers and performance&nbsp; of the duties appurtenant thereto.&nbsp; For this reason, it has been held that:<br><blockquote> "Actually holds office—within statute regulating tax commission's salaries, means <span style="font-style: italic;">discharge of duties</span> after due appointment and qualification.&nbsp; (Acts 1923, p. 14, section 1;&nbsp; p. 1S4, section 85.)"&nbsp; (Words and Phrases, Vol. 2, p. 266)&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)<br><br>" 'Actually holds office' means the discharge of the duties thereof after due appointment and qualification, as required&nbsp; by law, subject to removal at the will of the appointing power.

Santos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the former is "actually holding" the office of the&nbsp; mayor.<br><center><br><i>PETITIONER DISCHARGES&nbsp; ALL&nbsp; OF THE DUTIES AND <br>HAS ALL THE&nbsp; POWERS&nbsp; OF&nbsp; THE&nbsp; MAYOR</i><br></center><br>Although&nbsp; maintaining that petitioner merely performs said duties,&nbsp; without&nbsp; the powers&nbsp; vested in said office, the Solicitor General&nbsp; has&nbsp; been unable to&nbsp; name a&nbsp; single power of the-mayor which may not be&nbsp; legally exercised by the vice-mayor,&nbsp; during&nbsp; the former's suspension.&nbsp; That&nbsp; petitioner possesses all the powers attached to the office of the mayor&nbsp; is conceded&nbsp; in the very&nbsp; opinion of&nbsp; the majority. Indeed,&nbsp; in the ease of Eraña vs.&nbsp; Verge! de Dios&nbsp; (47 Off. Gaz., 2303, 2307), it was held that appointments "or&nbsp; other official acts- made by the Undersecretary of&nbsp; Health&nbsp; when acting&nbsp; as Department Head, have the same efficacy and&nbsp; legal effect as the acts of the regular incumbent," who was then absent.&nbsp; Inasmuch as petitioner is clothed with all the duties and powers of the municipal mayor.of San Juan del Monte, Rizal,—and this by operation of law (section 2196, Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code)—we&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; escape&nbsp; the conclusion that he is&nbsp; "actually holding" said office.<br><i><center><br>PETITIONER IS THE&nbsp; "ACTING MAYOR"<br></center></i><br>In fact, while&nbsp; performing&nbsp; said duties and exercising said powers, petitioner "acts as mayor", or is the "acting mayor." This is admitted&nbsp; (1) in the&nbsp; majority opinion, which states that petitioner had filed his certificate of candidacy for the office of the mayor while "acting as mayor" (pp. 1,. 2, 8 and&nbsp; 16); and&nbsp; (2) in the very letter of the Provincial Governor of&nbsp; Rizal&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; C),&nbsp; to&nbsp; petitioner herein, advising him of the appointment of respondent Sto. Domingo&nbsp; as Acting Municipal Vice-Mayor, which letter is addressed to said petitioner as&nbsp; "Acting .Municipal Mayor." This is in conformity with our view, in Erafla vs.&nbsp; Vergel de Dios&nbsp;&nbsp; (supra), to&nbsp; the effect that&nbsp; the Undersecretary of Health who,&nbsp; during the absence&nbsp; of the Secretary of Health, performs the&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of the&nbsp; latter—pursuant to. section&nbsp; 79 of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code is&nbsp; the "Acting Secretary"&nbsp; of Health,&nbsp; and that his acts, as such, have "the same efficacy&nbsp; or legal&nbsp; effect" as those&nbsp; of the Secietary of Health.<br><br>Now, then, "acting", according to Ballentine&nbsp; Law Dictionary (p. 19) is "substituting, <i>taking the place</i> of another officer temporarily, as an acting Judge."&nbsp; Since an acting mayor, therefore, temporarily&nbsp; takes the place of the regularly elected mayor, who, prior thereto, was actually holding said office, it&nbsp; follows' that the same&nbsp; is actually&nbsp; in&nbsp; the possession of,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; hence,&nbsp; "actually holding"&nbsp; the&nbsp; former, upon the&nbsp; aforementioned substitution. Said majority opinion states:<br><blockquote>"Petitioner claims that he' is the acting&nbsp; mayor.&nbsp; Respondents, insist that petitioner is merely acting as&nbsp; Mayor.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; pertinent and profitable, at least in the present case, to make a distinction between an Acting Mayor and a Vice-Mayor acting as Mayor. When a vacancy occurs&nbsp; in the office of&nbsp; Mayor, the Provincial&nbsp; Governor under section 21 (<i>a</i>) or the President under section 21 (<i>b</i>),&nbsp; (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) of the Election Code appoints or designates an <i>Acting Mayor.</i> in that case the person designated, or appointed becomes the Mayor and actually holds the office for the unexpired term of the office (section 21[<i>f</i>]) because when lie was appointed there was no regular incumbent to the&nbsp; office.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; when a"&nbsp; Vice-Mayor acts&nbsp; as Mayor,&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no vacancy in the post of Mayor. There is a regular incumbent Mayor only&nbsp; that the latter is under temporary disability. So, strictly and correctly speaking, the Vice-Mayor may not be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; <i>Acting</i>&nbsp; Mayor.&nbsp; He&nbsp; is only&nbsp; <i>acting</i> as <i>Mayor</i> temporarily,&nbsp; provisionally and during the temporary disability of the regular incumbent.&nbsp; He&nbsp; is not the incumbent.&nbsp; In base parlance, petitioner is only a pinch hitter, pinch hitting for the pitcher&nbsp; in an emergency. As a mere pinch hitter his name does not grace the regular&nbsp; line up, he is not the pitcher, doe hold the position of pitcher, neither&nbsp; does&nbsp; he receive all the benefits and privileges of the regular pitcher"&nbsp; (pp. 17-18).<br></blockquote>To&nbsp; begin with, when a&nbsp; permanent&nbsp; vacancy occurs&nbsp; in the office&nbsp; of municipal&nbsp; mayor, under section 21&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 180,&nbsp; <i>no&nbsp; appointment or&nbsp; designation is made by the&nbsp; President</i>, for the vice-mayor becomes&nbsp; the mayor.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; section 21(<i>d</i>)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (<i>e</i>)&nbsp; of said Act provides;<br><blockquote>"When a local officer-elect&nbsp; dies before assumption of office, or fails to qualify for any reason,, the P resident .may in his discretion either call a special election or fill the office by appointment,<br><br>"In case a special election&nbsp; has been called and held a have resulted in a failure to elect, the President shall fill t by appointment."<br></blockquote>The appointments made&nbsp; by the&nbsp; President under either paragraph&nbsp; may be temporary or permanent in nature.&nbsp; If permanent, the appointee is the mayor, <i>not</i> "acting mayor." If temporary,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointee&nbsp; is an "acting&nbsp; mayor" who, said&nbsp; opinion impliedly admits, holds <i>actually</i> the office&nbsp; of mayor. <br><br>Secondly,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; legal distinction&nbsp; between&nbsp; the phrases "acting mayor"&nbsp; and&nbsp; "acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; mayor."&nbsp; The distinction&nbsp; in these&nbsp; expressions is imposed&nbsp; merely by the rules of grammar.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; availed&nbsp; of&nbsp; as a&nbsp; gerund&nbsp; of the verb&nbsp; "to act," for the purpose of indicating the capacity in which an act has been performed,&nbsp; the word "acting" must be followed by the preposition&nbsp; "as," which is improper when said word is used as a noun, to describe the status of an officer.&nbsp; Thus, the Undersecretary of Health, "acting as" Secretary of Health, during&nbsp; the absence of the latter, is "acting Secretary of&nbsp; Health." '&nbsp; (Eraña&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Vergel de Dios, <i>supra.</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the vice-mayor "acting as mayor" during the suspension of the mayor, is the "acting mayor," and, this&nbsp; is confirmed by the aforementioned letter of the Provincial Governor of Eizal (Annex C) and by the established practice—referred to in&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid majority opinion—of addressing the vice-mayor&nbsp; discharging&nbsp; the duties of the&nbsp; Mayor,&nbsp; either as&nbsp; "Mayor"&nbsp; or as"'acting mayor."<br><br>Thirdly, the word "acting," when preceding the title of an office, simply connotes, in legal parlance, the temporary nature with which said office is held (Austria <i>vs.</i> Amante, 45 Off. Gaz., 2829).&nbsp;&nbsp; What is more, it indicates that the "acting"&nbsp; officer is&nbsp; physically in possession of the office, or actually holding it.<br><br>Fourthly, although a&nbsp; "pinch&nbsp; hitter" may. not&nbsp; be&nbsp; the "regular&nbsp; pitcher," when he&nbsp; pitches&nbsp; or&nbsp; bats,&nbsp; is&nbsp; he&nbsp; not the "actual" pitcher or batter?&nbsp;&nbsp; When he "strikes out" a batter or&nbsp; connects a&nbsp; "hit",&nbsp; or commits an "error", is the "strike, out", "hit", or "error" not&nbsp; counted&nbsp; actually,&nbsp; as a real&nbsp; one?<br><br>Fifthly,&nbsp; the vice-mayor&nbsp; acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; mayor,&nbsp; during&nbsp; the suspension of the mayor, is in&nbsp; a better position&nbsp; than a pinch-hitter,&nbsp; who, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; said,&nbsp; does not&nbsp; "receive&nbsp; all&nbsp; the benefits and privileges of the regular pitcher."&nbsp; Said acting mayor has all the powers and&nbsp; duties of the suspended mayor, who, in turn, can <i>not</i> discharge&nbsp; the functions of his office or even receive the emoluments.attached thereto, until exonerated or reinstated.<br><i><center><br>PETITIONER HAS ASSUMED THE OFFICE OF MAYOR<br></center></i><br>When a vice-mayor discharges&nbsp; the duties of a suspended mayor, the former "assumes" the office of the latter. This was acknowledged,&nbsp; expressly, in Laxamana <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.&nbsp;</span> Baltazar (48 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 8869), and by implication in said case of Eraña&nbsp; vs. Vergel de&nbsp; Dios (supra).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in the aforementioned communication of the Provincial Governor of Rizal, petitioner was informed&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Sto.&nbsp; Domingo, who has been appointed Acting Vice-Mayor, was to "assume the ' office of mayor during the suspension of Mayor Engracio E. Santos".&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that to assume an office&nbsp; is to take&nbsp; possession thereof, it is obvious to us that a vice-mayor performing the functions of the mayor who has been suspended, actually holds&nbsp; the office of the latter. <br><center><br><i>PETITIONER'S POSSESSION OF 'THE OFFICE OF MAYOR <br>HAS BEEN&nbsp; RECOGNIZED BY THE EXECUTIVE <br>DEPARTMENT</i><br></center><br>Again, said Provincial Governor and the Executive Secretary have directed and advised petitioner "to <i>turn over</i> the office of mayor" to respondent Sto. Domingo,&nbsp; thus implicitly,&nbsp; but, clearly,&nbsp; conceding that petitioner herein is the&nbsp; actual holder of&nbsp; said office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, how could he turn it over, even if he wanted to, to said respondent ? This is so patent that the majority opinion accepts the fact "that one acting as mayor not only&nbsp; discharges the. duties of the office, but, also exercises the powers of&nbsp; said office * * * so ,that in&nbsp; one sense and literally, <i>he may be legitimately considered as actually holding the office of the mayor",</i>&nbsp; and that "when a vice-mayor acts as mayor we usually call him mayor or acting mayor and deal' with him as though he were the regular incumbent" (p. 18).&nbsp; These views, we believe, must, however, be qualified.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner is the "actual" holder&nbsp; of the mayor's office, not "in <i>one</i> sense and literally," but in<i> every</i> sense, namely, literally and legally, in-ordinary parlance, as well as from&nbsp; the viewpoint of the law on&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Officers.&nbsp; Similarly,&nbsp; although petitioner&nbsp; is not the regular incumbent of the&nbsp; office of ' mayor, he is its actual and legal incumbent, for he holds office—and, accordingly, he is its actual <span style="font-style: italic;">incumbent</span>—pusuant&nbsp; to law, which&nbsp; legalizes his status.<br><i><center><br>"ACTUAL HOLDING"&nbsp; AND&nbsp; "CONSTRUCTIVE HOLDING<br>DISTINGUISHED<br></center></i><br>The issues would,&nbsp; perhaps, be clearer if we considered at closer&nbsp; range, the nature of a public office, the essence of which is. the right, authority and duty,&nbsp; forming part of the sovereign functions of the government, delegated by operation of law. Insofar as public officers are concerned, two other&nbsp; elements&nbsp; are material,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; title to the office, and (2)&nbsp; authority to exercise its&nbsp; powers and discharges&nbsp; its duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; former is&nbsp; usually&nbsp; acquired either by. appointment or by popular election although, in some instances,&nbsp; it may be secured by legislative enactment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, by statutory provision,&nbsp; a vice-mayor becomes <i>ipso facto</i> the mayor upon the death, removal, resignation or&nbsp; permanent disqualification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; regularly elected mayor (section 21[<i>b</i>], Republic Act No. 180).&nbsp; . The latter, in general, exists when the possessor of the former assumes office.&nbsp; At times, however,&nbsp; the&nbsp; regular incumbent cannot&nbsp; exercise the functions of his office,&nbsp; as when he: (1) is ousted&nbsp; by another, who enters upon the discharge of said functions; or (2) absent or&nbsp; becomes temporarily incapacitated"to perform his duties;&nbsp; or (3)&nbsp; is suspended from office by competent authority.<br><br>If, in the first case, the person who effected the ouster, and&nbsp; assumed&nbsp; the office in question, has color&nbsp; of&nbsp; title, which is defective,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the people,&nbsp; unaware of the defect, submit to, or invoke, his action,&nbsp; supposing him to be the officer he&nbsp; claims to. be, he is legally considered a&nbsp; <i>de facto</i> officer, the&nbsp; one ousted&nbsp; being regarded a&nbsp; de&nbsp; jure officer. It should&nbsp; be noted that the status of&nbsp; a de facto officer requires&nbsp; the&nbsp; concurrence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the following conditions,&nbsp; to wit: (<i>a</i>) there must be&nbsp; a, de jure office; (b) there must be actual possession of the office; and (<i>c</i>) this must be coupled with color of title.—In such event, the de facto officer is "actually&nbsp; holding"&nbsp; the&nbsp; office. The person vested with&nbsp; a valid title thereto, or the de jure officer, is not in&nbsp; material possession of the office.&nbsp; Hence he is not "actually holding" the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, he is deemed to hold the office, in the sense only, that there&nbsp; is no vacancy which may be filled&nbsp; by appointment or election, as the case may be.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a consequence, the office is held by two individuals, in different capacities:&nbsp; the <i>de facto</i> officer actualy&nbsp; holds&nbsp; the office, whereas the de jure&nbsp; officer retains&nbsp; possession thereof&nbsp; by legal fiction.&nbsp; This distinction between the actual and the constructive possession of a public office is vitally important in the case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar.<br><br>If the office involved&nbsp; in the second&nbsp; and third&nbsp; cases&nbsp; is that of&nbsp; a municipal&nbsp; mayor, the&nbsp; law&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 2195,&nbsp; Revised administrative Code; Laxamana <i>vs.</i> Baltazar, <i>supra</i>) requires the vice-mayor to&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; the duties of the mayor.&nbsp; In&nbsp; compliance with such requirement, the vice-mayor&nbsp; assumes&nbsp; the&nbsp; office of&nbsp; mayor, wields its powers, performs its1 duties, and,&nbsp; as a&nbsp; consequence,&nbsp; actually holds&nbsp; said&nbsp; office.&nbsp; The&nbsp; regular incumbent&nbsp; does&nbsp; not exercise&nbsp; said&nbsp; power or&nbsp; perform&nbsp; said duties, because&nbsp; he can not do&nbsp; so, owing, in the second case, to. his absence or&nbsp; disability,&nbsp; and, in the third case, to the&nbsp; order of suspension, which temporarily&nbsp; divests&nbsp; him&nbsp; of said&nbsp; powers and duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspended&nbsp; officer&nbsp; is legally deprived&nbsp; of the&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; those&nbsp; powers and&nbsp; perform said duties.&nbsp; Should&nbsp; he do so, in violation of the order of&nbsp; suspension, his acts&nbsp; would be&nbsp; null&nbsp; and void,&nbsp; for,&nbsp; in the eyes of the law,&nbsp; the mayor is, not he,&nbsp; but the vice-mayor&nbsp; acting&nbsp; as mayor-&nbsp; In short, said order oust the mayor, for&nbsp; the time being,&nbsp; from physical&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of. the&nbsp; office,&nbsp; thus resulting&nbsp; in its&nbsp; "temporary&nbsp; vacancy" (Laxamana <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Baltazar, supra), which is actually filled by&nbsp; the vice-mayor acting as mayor, in compliance with section 2195&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code. The suspended mayor merely, hold the legal title to the office, and, in&nbsp; this sense, only he&nbsp; is in constructive&nbsp; possession thereof. His&nbsp; condition&nbsp; is comparable&nbsp; to the&nbsp; holder&nbsp; of the naked title to a property, the&nbsp; usufruct of which&nbsp; is vested in another, who&nbsp; is in the&nbsp; material possession and enjoyment&nbsp; of said property.&nbsp; The latter is physically&nbsp; occupied .by the&nbsp; usufructuary, in the same manner&nbsp; as petitioner is "actually holding" the office&nbsp; of mayor,&nbsp; unlike the suspended mayor who, though actually holding the title to the office, does not hold the office itself, except constructively, or by legal fiction.<br><i><center><br>AS ACTING MAYOR, PETITIONER RECEIVES THE COMPENSATION <br>FOR THE OFFICE OF MAYOR<br></center></i><br>Pursuant to section&nbsp; 2187&nbsp; of the Revised Administrative Code,&nbsp; "the mayor shall receive full salary when&nbsp; absent "from the municipality" on official business "or * * *&nbsp; when he is absent from his office because of&nbsp; illnessy contracted through&nbsp; no fault of his own,&nbsp; provided the absence in the latter case does&nbsp; not exceed thirty days&nbsp; during, the&nbsp; year *&nbsp; * * ; and if during&nbsp; such authorized or justified absence the&nbsp; vice-mayor&nbsp; * * * temporarily&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; the&nbsp; local duties of the mayor,"&nbsp; said&nbsp; vice-mayor "may receive&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; in an&nbsp; amount to&nbsp; be fixed by&nbsp; the council * *&nbsp; * which shall not be in excess of the salary of the mayor for the&nbsp; same&nbsp; period." However, section 2192 provides that "a municipal officer&nbsp; suspended from duty pending&nbsp; an investigation of&nbsp; charges against him shall receive no pay during such suspension; but upon&nbsp; subsequent exoneration&nbsp; or reinstatement, the&nbsp; Department&nbsp; Head&nbsp; may order the payment of the whole or part of the&nbsp; salary accruing during such&nbsp;&nbsp; suspension."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; vice-mayor,&nbsp;&nbsp; acting&nbsp; as mayor during the suspension of the mayor, "shall&nbsp; receive compensation equivalent&nbsp; to the&nbsp; salary&nbsp; of the mayor," (Section&nbsp; 2187, Revised Administrative Code.)<br><br>In line&nbsp; with a practice established as early as&nbsp; 1916- when, the first&nbsp; Administrative Code was adopted-and followed,&nbsp; then, by the Department of the Interior,&nbsp; now, by the Division&nbsp; of&nbsp; Local&nbsp; Governments&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Office of the&nbsp; President,&nbsp; as well as by the&nbsp; Department&nbsp; of Finance and the Office of the Auditor General (before,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Insular Auditor),&nbsp; said compensation of the vice-mayor,&nbsp; acting as mayor, in lieu of the&nbsp; suspended mayor,&nbsp; is <i>paid from the appropriation for salary of the mayor.</i> Should, the suspended mayor be eventually exonerated or reinstated with pay, as provided&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 2192, the municipal council approves a new appropriation therefor, the original appropriation for salary of the mayor having been applied to the payment of the emoluments of the acting mayor.<br><br>The distinction between the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; a mayor. who is absent on&nbsp; official&nbsp; business or is sick, without his&nbsp; fault, for not more&nbsp; than 1 month a year,&nbsp; and the mayor who is suspended,&nbsp; as regards the right to compensation-for both the mayor&nbsp; and the vice-mayor acting in his place and the appropriation from which payment shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; made, constitutes another tangible and significant evidence that, when the mayor is suspended, the vice-mayor,&nbsp; who discharges the duties&nbsp; of the&nbsp; mayor, is&nbsp; regarded by law&nbsp; as the actual holder of the office of mayor. This conclusion becomes even&nbsp; more imperative when we&nbsp; consider that,&nbsp; by explicit&nbsp; legal&nbsp; provision, said&nbsp; <i>vice-mayor may no longer receive his 'per diems as vice-mayor, </i>for attendance of the sessions of the&nbsp; council&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 2187, Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code.)&nbsp; Thus, during his incumbency as "acting mayor", by which name he comes to be known, <i>he is more a mayor than&nbsp; a vice-mayor.</i><br><br>In the case&nbsp; of Rodriguez <i>vs. </i>Tan (48&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 3380), the petitioner in&nbsp; an election protest,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of Senator, who&nbsp; won&nbsp; said protest,&nbsp; Was not allowed to&nbsp; recover the salary collected by the defeated protestee during the period of&nbsp; his&nbsp; incumbency, despite the fact&nbsp; that the latter had actually held&nbsp; office merely as a <i>de facto</i> officer. , Surely, petitioner&nbsp; herein, who had, not&nbsp; only the&nbsp; right, but, also, the duty, to act as mayor, even if temporarily, has a better status than a <i>de facto</i>, officer and,&nbsp; like the latter, at least, must be considered legally as. the actual . holder of the office&nbsp; of mayor.<br><center><br><i>THE SUSPENDED MAYOR DOES NOT "ACTUALLY."&nbsp; HOLD <br>THE&nbsp; OFFICE OF MAYOR </i><br></center><br>As already&nbsp; adverted&nbsp; to, when a mayor is suspended his office becomes temporarily vacant&nbsp; (Laxamana<i> vs.</i> Baltazar,<i> supra</i>,; section 2195, Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code; Section 21 [<i>a</i>], Republic Act No. 180).&nbsp; This fact is absolutely inconsistent with the theory that he actually holds the office of mayor, during the period of&nbsp; suspension.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; said&nbsp; mayor may be "reinstated" in office (section 2192, Revised Administrative Code)., This means necessarily that, during&nbsp; said suspension, the,mayor does not actually hold his&nbsp; office, for reinstatement is&nbsp; restoration&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp; possession&nbsp; formerly . enjoyed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; thereafter lost.&nbsp; Such, loss of. actual&nbsp; possession&nbsp; is&nbsp; total. The suspended mayor retains nothing&nbsp; but the naked title—he is completely&nbsp; stripped of&nbsp; the beneficial enjoyment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the powers appurtenant to the office.&nbsp; The forfeiture,&nbsp; though temporary, of the official attributes—save as to&nbsp; the naked title—is&nbsp; such that the&nbsp; suspension <i> ipso&nbsp; facto</i>&nbsp; deprives the. mayor&nbsp; even of the&nbsp; right to compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section 2192,&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code).&nbsp; What is&nbsp; more,&nbsp; the emoluments attached to his&nbsp; office become due, by operation of law&nbsp; (section 2187,&nbsp; do. do.), to the vice-mayor .acting as .mayor.<br><i><center><br>THE LEGISLATIVE&nbsp; INTENT<br></center></i><br>It&nbsp; is urged that the phrase "actually&nbsp; holding",&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 27&nbsp; of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 180,&nbsp; was&nbsp; meant to refer only to "permanent"&nbsp; incumbents and does&nbsp; not apply&nbsp; to those&nbsp; holding office in a temporary character. We&nbsp; cannot accept this view, for the following reasons, to wit:<br><ol type="1"><li>&nbsp;The law is plain, simple and clear. The resignation therein provided is inapplicable to any elective local official who&nbsp; run?' for an&nbsp; office he&nbsp; actually holds.&nbsp; It&nbsp; does not qualify the nature of said possession,&nbsp; so long as, it&nbsp; is "actual".&nbsp; It is irrelevant,&nbsp; therefore whether the office is&nbsp; held temporarily or permanently.<br><br></li><li>One of&nbsp; the&nbsp; purposes of Congress, it is claimed, in providing that the filing of the certificate of candidacy shall&nbsp; not operate as a resignation, when&nbsp; a local elective officer runs for&nbsp; an office&nbsp; he is&nbsp; actually holding, is that:</li></ol><blockquote> "By&nbsp; continuing in office&nbsp; the office holder allowed and expected' to use the prerogatives authority and influence of his office in&nbsp; his campaign for his election or re-election to, the office he was holding.<br></blockquote>It is&nbsp; obvious,&nbsp; however, that—as the one vested by law with the authority to exercise the powers and&nbsp; discharge the duties of the&nbsp; mayor—petitioner is&nbsp; the person&nbsp; who could carry&nbsp; out said alleged intent of&nbsp; the law-maker. Upon the other&nbsp; hand, the, suspended mayor&nbsp; could not be so, even if he wanted to, for his suspension prevents him from&nbsp; availing himself,&nbsp; during the election campaign, of the authority, influence&nbsp; and prerogatives of the office of mayor.<br><ol start="3"><li>Admittedly, if the acting mayor had been&nbsp; appointed by the President, the filing of his certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; candidacy for the&nbsp; office of mayor would not operate as a resignation from&nbsp; said&nbsp; office.&nbsp; Said presidential&nbsp; appointee could have received, however, either a&nbsp; regular or permanent appointment, or a designation&nbsp; or temporary appointment.&nbsp; We are unable to find any valid and sufficient reason—and none&nbsp; has been offered in&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority opinion—why a discrimination should be&nbsp; made in favor of the&nbsp; person so given,&nbsp; by the Executive, a temporary appointment and against&nbsp; one, like petitioner herein, chosen by the&nbsp; law itself, from which the Chief Magistrate of the land derives his power to make said appointment.<br><br></li><li>The, last paragraph of section&nbsp; 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 666, the former election law, reads as follows:<br></li></ol><blockquote>"Any elective provincial, municipal, or&nbsp; city&nbsp; official&nbsp; running for an office, other than the one for "which he has been lastly elected, shall be considered resigned from his office from the moment of the filing of&nbsp; his certificate of candidacy."<br></blockquote>This&nbsp; provision was amended&nbsp; by section 27 of Republic Act No. 180, which eliminated the clause&nbsp; "other than the one for which he has been last elected", and substituted, in lieu&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; the words&nbsp; "other than the&nbsp; one&nbsp; which he is actually holding".&nbsp; Explaining the purpose of the amendment, in reply&nbsp; to criticisms made&nbsp; by members of the Senate who belonged to&nbsp; the then minority party, Senator Tirona,&nbsp; Chairman of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Committee&nbsp; sponsoring&nbsp; the measure&nbsp; on the&nbsp; floor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Senate and, in, effect,&nbsp; majority spokesman in relation&nbsp; thereto, had the following to say:<br><blockquote>"Precisamento, por el hecho. de&nbsp; que&nbsp; una gran mayoria de los gobernadores provincialos, miembros de la Junta Provincial, alcaldes, vice&nbsp; alcaldes y concejales municipales, son de nombramiento, queda justifieada la disposicion del articulo 27,&nbsp; porque si&nbsp; se&nbsp; aplicara&nbsp; a esos&nbsp; funcionarios la prohibicion de que no pueden ser candidatos a los Carlos que ocupan a&nbsp; menos que damitan, <i>se produciria un grave des harajuste que podria&nbsp; perjudicar la administration de los asuntos pro vinciales y municipales.</i> Por que?&nbsp; Porque el cambio de todos esos funcionarios provinciales no. se podiia hacer facilmente, <i>Daria lugar a muchos conflictos de grupos o&nbsp; facciones; a una, infinidad&nbsp; de&nbsp; cuestiones." </i>Congressional record of&nbsp; the 1st Congress of the Republic, Vol.&nbsp; II, p.&nbsp; 108).. (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>It is apparent, from the foregoing, <i>that the amendment merely sought to minimize the number of vacancies resulting from the filing of certificate of&nbsp; candidacy by persons holding local elective offices.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason was&nbsp; both administrative and political.&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative, because too many vacancies, it was feared, would gravely disrupt the administration of local&nbsp; governments..&nbsp; Political, because every vacancy would create the difficult problem, of filing the&nbsp; same <i>precisely on&nbsp; the eve of elections.</i>&nbsp; Indeed, each vacancy is more likely to lead to political discontent than to political expediency, considering&nbsp; that, for every appointment&nbsp; to' fill&nbsp; a vacancy, there&nbsp; would&nbsp; generally be several disappointed&nbsp; and&nbsp; disillusioned candidates therefor,&nbsp; who might, as a consequence work against the administration;<br><ol start="5"><li>The journals of Congress contain&nbsp; ample evidence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that,, when&nbsp; section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 1 666 was&nbsp; amended by section 27 of Republic Act No. 180, the&nbsp; members of both&nbsp; Houses knew that there&nbsp; existed&nbsp; a sizeable number of local officials holding elective positions by&nbsp; virtue&nbsp; of presidential appointments,&nbsp; some&nbsp; of which were&nbsp; temporary, in nature.&nbsp; Yet,&nbsp; Congress approved the amendment with&nbsp; the understanding&nbsp; that it would apply equally to the permanent and the temporary appointees of the executive branch.&nbsp; Obviously, therefore, the phrase "actually holding", in said section 27, does not refer solely to "permanent" officers.<br><br></li><li>Although the aforementioned amendment was bitterly criticized by the minority members of Congress, by reason of its favorable effects upon&nbsp; said presidential&nbsp; appointees and upon the&nbsp; political party then in power,. nothing was said in the course of the deliberations of the&nbsp; lawmaking body, to&nbsp; indicate, even if remotely, the intent&nbsp; to exclude, from the benefits of said amendment,&nbsp; those who may&nbsp; be actually holding local elective offices by operation of law. Said journals are absolutely silent on this point.<br><br></li><li>It is argued for the respondents that section 27 contemplates an office from&nbsp; which its incumbent could resign, and that&nbsp; it could not apply,&nbsp; therefore, to the'&nbsp; office&nbsp; of mayor, which&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; claims to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; actually,&nbsp; for,&nbsp; as vice-mayor acting as&nbsp; mayor&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; suspension&nbsp; of the mayor, said petitioner&nbsp; cannot resign from the office of&nbsp; mayor. Let us&nbsp; examine carefully said section&nbsp; 27, which,&nbsp; for convenience,&nbsp; we reproduce&nbsp; once&nbsp; more.<br></li></ol><blockquote>"An&nbsp; elective provincial, municipal, or city official&nbsp; running' for an office, other than the&nbsp; one which he is actually holding, shall be considered resigned from his office from the&nbsp; moment of the filing of his&nbsp; certificate of candidacy."<br></blockquote>It will be noted that&nbsp; the word "office"&nbsp; is twice used therein; firstly, in the expression "running&nbsp; for an office, other than the one which&nbsp; he is actually holding;" and, secondly in the clause "shall be' considered resigned from his office."&nbsp; Obviously, the latter&nbsp; refers to&nbsp; an office from which it is possible to&nbsp; resign.&nbsp; Does the former allude&nbsp; to an&nbsp; analoguos&nbsp; situation?&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; do&nbsp; not&nbsp; think so,&nbsp; for the "office" first mentioned is the one&nbsp; for which&nbsp; the candidate is <i>running.</i> Moreover, it&nbsp; specifically refers to an&nbsp; office "other than the one which he is actually holding."&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the office actually held by&nbsp; the&nbsp; candidate were&nbsp; one he could give up by resignation, he could&nbsp; not possibly do&nbsp; .so as to the "other" office,&nbsp; for which he&nbsp; seeks the popular mandate,&nbsp; because he does not hold that office as&nbsp; yet.<br><br>Must&nbsp; the office&nbsp; he is "actually&nbsp; holding" be one from which he could resign,&nbsp; if he so desired?&nbsp; One can resign from an office to which he had&nbsp; been duly elected&nbsp; or appointed.&nbsp; If such were the office contemplated in section 127, the&nbsp; same would have&nbsp; used only the word&nbsp; "holding," ' without&nbsp; the qualification&nbsp; "actually," it&nbsp; being clear—particularly to the members&nbsp; of Congress, most of&nbsp; whom are lawyers—that an office may be held materially by one who has not been elected or appointed thereto, such as the ease of a vice-mayor&nbsp; acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; mayor, in compliance with Article 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code,., in view of the suspension of the mayor. <br><br>The situation visualized in section 27 would be more apparent had&nbsp; petitioner filed his certificate of candidacy for the office of provincial&nbsp; governor.&nbsp; This&nbsp; being other than the offices he is actually holding—those of vice-mayor and mayor-he would be deemed, by&nbsp; operation of said section 27, resigned from "Ms" office, namely that of vice-mayor. Having thus relinquished this office, we would, necessarily, have no more authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; act as mayor.&nbsp; In other words, the office he is "actually holding" need not be necessarily his office, and this is not unusual&nbsp; under the Law on Public Office.&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp; the word "actually" would be not only unnecessary, but inconsistent with the alleged purpose of the law.<br><ol start="8"><li>It is. next&nbsp; said that,&nbsp; in section 27 of Republic Act No. 180, "Congress contemplated only one office&nbsp; actually, held."&nbsp; This view is based upon the clause "an office other than <i>the one</i>&nbsp; which is&nbsp; based&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; clause&nbsp; "an office other than <i>the one</i> which&nbsp; he&nbsp; is actually&nbsp; holding," in said provision, with&nbsp; emphasis&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; the phrase&nbsp; "the&nbsp; one".&nbsp; It will be recalled that said clause is only an amendment of the last paragraph&nbsp; of section 2 of Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 666, reading:</li></ol><blockquote>"Any&nbsp; elective provincial,&nbsp; municipal, or&nbsp; city&nbsp; official running for <i>an office, other than the one for which he has been lastly elected,</i> shall be considered resigned from&nbsp; MS office from the&nbsp; moment of tie filing 01 his certificate of candidacy."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>In other words,&nbsp; the&nbsp; word&nbsp; "one" was&nbsp; not inserted, by 1 Republic Act No.&nbsp; 180.&nbsp; It was part of said section 2 of Commonwealth Act.No. 666, which referred to an elective local official "running for an office other than the one for which&nbsp; he has&nbsp; been lastly&nbsp; elected."&nbsp; Since, normally,&nbsp; a person is elected to only one office, it was only natural for said section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 666 to use the word "one".&nbsp; But,&nbsp; let us suppose&nbsp; that, during the effectivity of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 666, a law was passed permitting an individual to&nbsp; run for, and&nbsp; hold, two offices, say, for instance,&nbsp; the&nbsp; positions of municipal mayor&nbsp; and member of the provincial board,&nbsp; and that while holding both elective offices, the incumbent should, in a subsequent election, file&nbsp; his certificate of candidacy for&nbsp; municipal mayor only, would he not be&nbsp; entitled to continue in office, as mayor&nbsp; and&nbsp; as&nbsp; member of&nbsp; the provincial board,&nbsp; despite the fact that he is not running for the&nbsp; last office?&nbsp; Obviously, the word&nbsp; "one" was&nbsp; used&nbsp; in&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 666 (section 2) merely because it assumed that, the person concerned had been elected only to one office.&nbsp; This did not mean, however, that&nbsp; one&nbsp; legally elected&nbsp; to, and holding, two elective offices,&nbsp; Was sought to be excluded from the benefits of said enactment. <br><br>Similarly, section 27 of Republic Act No." 180&nbsp; assumes-— in line&nbsp; with the ordinary course of events.—that one discharging the duties of a given office does not hold&nbsp; any other office, without implying&nbsp; necessarily, that,&nbsp; otherwise, he would be denied the&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; of said provision.&nbsp; As pointed&nbsp; out in the&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; pages,&nbsp; the&nbsp; purpose of said provision was to permit an&nbsp; incumbent to remain in office if he&nbsp; did not seek&nbsp; to change&nbsp; the<span style="font-style: italic;"> status quo</span>, such as the case of&nbsp; petitioner herein.<br><i><center><br>EXAMPLES ANALYZED<br></center></i><br>Several examples&nbsp; have been given to illustrate the&nbsp; alleged validity of respondents' pretense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us&nbsp; analyze said examples:<br><br>The&nbsp; first&nbsp; is,&nbsp; substantially, as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; A vice-mayor, while acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; mayor, filed&nbsp; his certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; candidacy for vice-mayor.&nbsp; Thereupon,&nbsp; the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; governor, alleging that said&nbsp; candidate is&nbsp; actually holding the office of mayor and that&nbsp; he is not running for such&nbsp; office, asked him&nbsp; to vacate&nbsp; it.&nbsp; After&nbsp; giving up, reluctantly,&nbsp; the office of mayor, the&nbsp; vice-mayor,&nbsp; asserts&nbsp; that lie&nbsp; actually holds the office of vice-mayor; that, since he is running for re-election therefor, he is not deemed resigned as vice-mayor; and&nbsp; that,&nbsp; as vice-mayor,&nbsp; he&nbsp; is entitled to&nbsp; act&nbsp; as mayor. Then, the assertion is made that "this possible, undesirable and&nbsp; anomalous&nbsp; situation&nbsp; is another: reason&nbsp; why; section 27&nbsp; may&nbsp; not be applied&nbsp; to&nbsp; "the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; a vice-mayor, .acting as mayor."&nbsp; But,&nbsp; why should this&nbsp; situation&nbsp; be undesirable&nbsp; or anomalous?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it&nbsp; not merely&nbsp; a&nbsp; natural and&nbsp; logical consequence of the fact that section 2185 of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code&nbsp; requires the vice-mayor, in the event therein contemplated,&nbsp; to hold,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the same time, two offices, namely, the office of vice-mayor and that of mayor?. Is the holder&nbsp; of such offices not bound to discharge the duties&nbsp; of both?&nbsp; Is he, as a consequence,&nbsp; not entitled,&nbsp; logically&nbsp; and by law, to&nbsp; all the privileges and prerogatives attached to said offices?&nbsp; Is the&nbsp; right to run for election&nbsp; to&nbsp; an office&nbsp; actually&nbsp; held,&nbsp; without&nbsp; resigning therefrom, not one of such privileges&nbsp; or&nbsp; prerogatives ? I&nbsp; Is it not only fair, just and reasonable that&nbsp; the&nbsp; increased responsibilities of the&nbsp; vice-mayor, acting&nbsp; as mayor, be coupled&nbsp; with&nbsp; a&nbsp; corresponding increase&nbsp; in&nbsp; his powers, exemptions and&nbsp; immunities?<br><br>The second example is couched in the following language;<br><blockquote>"The regular incumbent&nbsp; Mayor files his certificate of candidacy for the same&nbsp; office of Mayor.&nbsp; Then lie goes on leave&nbsp; of&nbsp; absence" or falls sick and, the Vice-Mayor&nbsp; acts&nbsp; in his place, and while&nbsp; thus acting he also files his certificate of candidacy&nbsp; for the&nbsp; same office of Mayor.&nbsp; Then the Vice-Mayor also goes on&nbsp; leave or fails sick or is suspended, and because the regular Mayor is&nbsp; still unable&nbsp; to return&nbsp; to office,&nbsp; under section 2195 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Administrative T Code, the councilor who at the last general elections received the highest number of votes, acts as Mayor and while&nbsp; thus acting he *" . also&nbsp; files&nbsp; his certificate of&nbsp; candidacy for the office&nbsp; of Mayor.&nbsp; The Vice-Mayor also campaigns for the same post&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mayor claiming like the herein&nbsp; petitioner that he did not lose his office&nbsp; of Vice- Mayor because&nbsp; he filed&nbsp; his certificate,&nbsp; of&nbsp; candidacy&nbsp; while acting as Mayor and thus was actually holding&nbsp; the office of Mayor. Using the&nbsp; same&nbsp; argument the councilor&nbsp; -who had previously acted as Mayor also campaigns&nbsp; for his election to' the same post of Mayor while keeping his&nbsp; position' as councilor. Thus we would have this singular&nbsp; situation&nbsp; of&nbsp; three&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; officials&nbsp; occupying&nbsp; three separate and distinct offices,&nbsp; running for the same office of Mayor, yet keeping their&nbsp; different respective&nbsp; offices, and strangel enough two&nbsp; of those offices (Vice-Mayor and Councilor)&nbsp; are different from the office of Mayor they are running for.&nbsp; Could that situation have been contemplated&nbsp; by the Legislature in&nbsp; enacting section 2 the Revised Election Code?&nbsp; We do not think so, and yet that would happen if&nbsp; the contention of the&nbsp; petitioner about' the meaning of "actually holding office" is to prevail."&nbsp;&nbsp; (pp. 14-16.)<br></blockquote>The example is most ingenious,&nbsp; but, to our mind,&nbsp; not in point.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; order&nbsp; that the mayor, the&nbsp; vice-mayor and the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; councilor alluded to&nbsp; could run&nbsp; for&nbsp; mayor, without resigning from their respective offices,&nbsp; pursuant to section 27 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 180, it would be necessary that each be "actually holding" the office of mayor. Inasmuch,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; as "actual holding" is equivalent&nbsp; to material or physical&nbsp; possession, and "possession as&nbsp; a fact cannot be&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; time in two&nbsp; different personalities,&nbsp; except in&nbsp; cases of co-possession"&nbsp; (Article. 538,&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil Procedure) it&nbsp; follows&nbsp; that it&nbsp; would be necessary to&nbsp; determine which one, among the officers involved&nbsp; in the&nbsp; example, is "actually holding" the office of mayor, and&nbsp; that the person declared to&nbsp; be in&nbsp; physical possession of. such office should be the only one not deemed to have resigned in&nbsp; consequence of the filing of his certificate of candidacy for mayor.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; not indispensable for the determination of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case at bar, it&nbsp; would seem that&nbsp; said privilege&nbsp; belongs solely to the officer in fact&nbsp; discharging&nbsp; the&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of the office of mayor, at the time of the expiration of the statutory period for the filing of certificate of candidacy.&nbsp; Indeed, until then,&nbsp; the other officers could withdraw&nbsp; the certificates of candidacy already filed&nbsp; by them,&nbsp; and file&nbsp; other certificates of&nbsp; candidacy for the respective offices&nbsp; actually&nbsp; held by them at such time, thus avoiding the implicit resignation which otherwise may result from&nbsp; the. application of said section 27.<br><center><br><i>EXCEPTIONS&nbsp; MUST BE CONSTRUED STRICTLY</i><br></center><br>The rule&nbsp; of statutory construction to&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect that exceptions must&nbsp; be strictly construed, has been&nbsp; invoked ¦in favor&nbsp; of respondents herein.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; claimed that,&nbsp; as a matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; general rule, a local elective official who runs for an elective office is, pursuant to section 27 of Republic Act No. 180, deemed to have resigned from his office from the moment of the filing of his certificate of candidacy; that such rule does not&nbsp; apply, when he runs for an office other than&nbsp; the one he is actually holding; and that, this is the exception which should be construed strictly.<br><br>The argument is logical, but&nbsp; its&nbsp; major&nbsp; premise&nbsp; is predicated upon the&nbsp; assumption&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; section 27&nbsp; establishes&nbsp; the general rule.&nbsp; We&nbsp; believe,&nbsp; otherwise.&nbsp; To&nbsp; our mind,&nbsp; the general rule is&nbsp; that&nbsp; an elective official shall remain in&nbsp; office&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; full&nbsp; term&nbsp; for&nbsp; which&nbsp; he was elected, although&nbsp; he may have&nbsp; filed a certificate of candidacy.&nbsp; The exception is that he shall be&nbsp; deemed' to have resigned from his office, from the time of the filing of said certificate of candidacy, if (1)&nbsp; he is a provincial, municipal or city official, and (2)&nbsp; the office&nbsp; for which&nbsp; he runs is other than the one he is actually holding. <i>if he runs for the office&nbsp; he is actually holding,&nbsp; the general rule applies</i>— he shall not be deemed to&nbsp; have resigned&nbsp; from his office. In other words, the provision implying a resignation from the filing of the&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of candidacy in the exception, which should be construed strictly.<br><br>This interpretation&nbsp; is demanded,&nbsp; not&nbsp; merely by&nbsp; the fact that Republic Act&nbsp; No.' 180 is- a part of our&nbsp; law on Public Officers, and should be construed jointly with the latter, but,&nbsp; also, by the fundamental principles underlying the&nbsp; democratic system of&nbsp; government established&nbsp; in the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; petition was chosen by the&nbsp; direct  vote of the&nbsp; people, in whom sovereignty resides.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, Republic Act&nbsp; No. 180 was passed not by the people themselves, but by their representatives.&nbsp; The people elected petitioner&nbsp; herein for a&nbsp; term&nbsp; ending on December&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of&nbsp; clear, positive and&nbsp; unequivocal provision of law to the&nbsp; contrary,&nbsp; the member&nbsp; of Congress, as&nbsp; agents of&nbsp; the people,&nbsp; must be presumed to have intended to respect said direct mandate of their principal.<br><br>In the case of a vice-mayor acting as mayor,1 who runs for mayor, the intention&nbsp; of&nbsp; Congress to oust him from both offices is far from being patent or incontestible.&nbsp; In fact, the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in section 27 of Republic Act No. 180, in relation to sections 2187,&nbsp; 2192 and 2195' of the Revised Administrative Code, connotes that petitioner is&nbsp; actually holding the office of mayor,&nbsp; for which he ran at the last general elections, and that, accordingly, he shall not be deemed to have resigned upon the filing of&nbsp; his certificate&nbsp; of candidacy&nbsp; for said office.&nbsp; Indeed, it is admitted, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority opinion,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; letter of said section&nbsp; 27 favors&nbsp; petitioner herein—said opinion states that,&nbsp; literally, petitioner is actually&nbsp; holding the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; any&nbsp; rate,&nbsp; the factors analyzed in the foregoing&nbsp; pages, the very efforts exerted in&nbsp; said opinion to bolster up the&nbsp; stand therein taken&nbsp; and the conflicting views&nbsp; among&nbsp; the members of this&nbsp; Court, who are almost equally divided&nbsp; on the issue under&nbsp; consideration, eloquently demonstrate that the law upon which respondents&nbsp; rely is, at&nbsp; least,&nbsp; not free from ambiguities or&nbsp; doubts.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; should be&nbsp; resolved in favor of petitioner's continuance in&nbsp; office,&nbsp; for the full term for which he was elected.<br><center><br><i>THE ACTUAL HOLDER OF&nbsp; AW&nbsp; OFFICE HAS PRESUMPTIVELY&nbsp; <br>A BETTER RIGHT THERETO</i><br></center><br>Although a public office is not&nbsp; property, in&nbsp; the strict setise of the word, the right to&nbsp; a&nbsp; given&nbsp; person to hold a particular&nbsp; office partakes of the&nbsp; nature of a property, in that he&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; deprived of&nbsp; such&nbsp; right&nbsp; without due process of law, (42 Am. 886-888;&nbsp; State vs. Wadhams, 67 N.W. 64, 64 Minn. 318, 324; Christy<i> vs.</i> Kingfisher, 76 P. 135, 1375, 13 Okl. 585; Hamilton vs. Brennan.&nbsp; 119 N.Y.S. 2d 83 [20 Gen.&nbsp; Digest p. 864]);&nbsp; 11 O.S.&nbsp; 1951 Su 572— Laison&nbsp; vs. Bunch,&nbsp; 225 P.&nbsp; 2d.&nbsp; 486 (21 Gen,&nbsp; Digest p. 348)—1953; Emerson vs.&nbsp; Hughes, 90 A. 2d. 910, 117 Vt. 270 [19&nbsp; Gen.

He who wishes to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; the property&nbsp; from&nbsp; its&nbsp; possessor as owner must prove,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; a better&nbsp; title thereto.&nbsp; Similarly, the actual holder of an office, under color of&nbsp; title, like petitioner&nbsp; herein, must be respected and protected, in the enjoyment&nbsp; of said&nbsp; possession,&nbsp; unless the party seeking&nbsp; to eject him therefrom shall&nbsp; establish satisfactorily that said title is defective and that his (claimant's) is the legitimate and stronger title.&nbsp; In other words, doubts must be resolved,in favor&nbsp; of the actual holder of the office.<br><br>At any rate, to our mind,&nbsp; the law is patently in favor of petitioner herein.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; he&nbsp; filed his certificate&nbsp; of candidacy for the&nbsp; office of mayor of San Juan&nbsp; del Monte, Rizal, he was&nbsp; actually discharging&nbsp; the duties and&nbsp; exercising the powers of&nbsp; said&nbsp; office.&nbsp; The public and the very Government,&nbsp; as well as the&nbsp; law (section 2187,&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code), regarded him as&nbsp; the acting mayor of said&nbsp; municipality. He&nbsp; received the&nbsp; emoluments appurtenant to the office. He had all of the responsibilities attached thereto, including the civil and criminal liabilities which would accrue to the' regularly elected mayor, in case of nonfeasance, misfeasance or malfeasance in office.<br><br>Upon the other hand, having been suspended as mayor , of San Juan del Monte, Engracio Santos was&nbsp; stripped of his functions as such, he1 could not, and did not, discharge the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; He was not&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; collect the compensation corresponding to said office,&nbsp; which compensation&nbsp; was paid to herein petitioner.&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, the latter&nbsp; was literally and&nbsp; legally&nbsp; in actual&nbsp; physical possession of the office of mayor.<br><br>Moreover, the language of section 27 of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 180 is too&nbsp; plain, simple and clear to&nbsp; admit of construction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well&nbsp; settled that "where the intention of the legislature is so apparent from the face of the statute there can be no question as to the&nbsp; meaning, there is no room for construction."&nbsp;&nbsp; (People ex rel. Wood<i> vs.</i> Sands, 102&nbsp; Cal. 12,' 36 Pac.&nbsp; 404.)<br><br>Again,&nbsp; in ordinary, as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; in&nbsp; legal,' parlance, to hold actually an office&nbsp; is to have physical or legal&nbsp; possession thereof, to occupy the office&nbsp; in fact or really, as&nbsp; distinguished from, or opposed, to its&nbsp; presumptive or constructive possession.&nbsp;&nbsp; To declare, therefore, that Engracio Santos who does not, and cannot, perform&nbsp; the functions of mayor of San Juan del Monte—not petitioner herein'— who actually,&nbsp; really,&nbsp;&nbsp; materially and in fact discharges the same—is the persons "actually holding" said office, does not amount merely to a construction, of the meaning of "actually,&nbsp; holding",&nbsp; but&nbsp; to&nbsp; giving&nbsp; thereto&nbsp;&nbsp; its&nbsp; opposite meaning,&nbsp; its&nbsp; exact antithesis.&nbsp; With due&nbsp; respect, to&nbsp; the. learned view&nbsp; of our&nbsp; distinguished colleagues to&nbsp; the contrary, we do not feel that judicial power may go that far, consistently with the principle of separation&nbsp; of powers.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition should be&nbsp; granted and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction,&nbsp; issued upon the institution of this&nbsp; case,&nbsp; should be made permanent.</div>
