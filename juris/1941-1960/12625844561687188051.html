Bernardo and Melecio Palacios, swearing that they are Filipino citizens and attesting that they have personally&nbsp; known the petitioner, the former&nbsp; since 1936 and the latter since 1930; that the petitioner has been continuously residing in the Philippines since the time they have known him, and particularly in Cebu City since 1952; that the petitioner is of&nbsp; good&nbsp; moral character; and that in their opinion he has ail the qualifications and none&nbsp; of the disqualifications to become a citizen of the Republic. <br><br>After due publication&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; and hearing, the Court granted the petition. <br><br>Dr. Eduardo A.&nbsp; Bernardo,&nbsp; one of the supporting witnesses, testified that he is a resident of&nbsp; Cebu City; that<br><br>he knows the petitioner whom he met sometime in 1936 in Surigao when he was connected with the Army; that in&nbsp; 1938, because of the friendship that developed between them, he (the witness) asked him (the petitioner)"&nbsp; to be&nbsp; the&nbsp; godfather of his eldest son; that in&nbsp; 1939,&nbsp; 1940&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1941, they were together in Surigao;&nbsp; that their association ,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was interrupted&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; occupation;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; after liberation&nbsp; they resumed&nbsp; seeing each other again;&nbsp; and that in&nbsp; 1952 they visited&nbsp; each other in Cebu&nbsp; City&nbsp;&nbsp; at their respective houses and attended each other's parties.<br><br>Melecio&nbsp; Palacios, another supporting&nbsp; witness, testified&nbsp;&nbsp; that he is&nbsp; a resident of Cebu City; that he came to&nbsp; know the&nbsp; petitioner in Cebu City in 1981 or&nbsp; 1932,&nbsp; while he (the petitioner)&nbsp; was a young man; that in&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner began to reside in Cebu&nbsp; City where&nbsp; he built his house, they met in the streets&nbsp; and at the house of his (the petitioner's) brothers and relatives;&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; friendly with the petitioner's&nbsp; brothers&nbsp; and sisters "since a long time&nbsp; ago;" and that actually he has no knowledge of the&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; business&nbsp; activities and of his social dealings with the&nbsp; Filipinos.<br><br>A petition for naturalization must be&nbsp; supported by the affidavit of at least two credible persons, stating&nbsp; that they are&nbsp; citizens&nbsp; of the Philippines&nbsp; and personally know&nbsp; the petitioner to be a resident&nbsp; of the Philippines for a period of ten years as required by section 1 in connection with section&nbsp; 2 of&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 473, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> The affidavit&nbsp; of two&nbsp; credible&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; who&nbsp; must&nbsp; be presented in&nbsp; Court to testify&nbsp; at the&nbsp; hearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> except for a&nbsp; valid&nbsp; excuse such&nbsp; as death,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> is&nbsp; required&nbsp; by law&nbsp; to ascertain how the petitioner has acted during the ten-year period, whether he has conducted himself in a proper and irreproachable manner&nbsp; in&nbsp; relation with the&nbsp; constituted government and in the community in which he lived, and whether&nbsp; he has mingled socially with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Filipinos&nbsp; and has&nbsp; evinced&nbsp; a sincere desire&nbsp; to learn&nbsp; and embrace the customs, traditions and ideals&nbsp; of the Filipinos.&nbsp; In&nbsp; fine, much depends upon what they know of the petitioner&nbsp; during at least ten years before he applied for naturalization. That is why&nbsp; it is necessary that these witnesses know the petitioner for at least that period of time.<br><br>The petitioner's&nbsp; two supporting witnesses, whose joint affidavit&nbsp; is attached to the petition, do not have the qualifications&nbsp; required by the Revised Naturalization Law.&nbsp; The first witness came to know the petitioner in Surigao&nbsp; in 1936.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were together in Surigao in 1939, 1940 and 1941&nbsp; and&nbsp; their association was interrupted&nbsp; during the Japanese occupation&nbsp; and&nbsp; resumed only after&nbsp; liberation. The statement of the&nbsp; witness that they&nbsp; were&nbsp; together&nbsp; in Surigao&nbsp; in 1939, 1940 and&nbsp; 1941 contradicts&nbsp; the allegation of the petitioner that he was in Butuan City from 1931 to 1941.&nbsp; Again,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same witness&nbsp; states&nbsp; that&nbsp; in 1952 they used to exchange visits at their&nbsp; respective houses&nbsp; in Cebu City and attended each other's&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; So, it was only&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1952 when the petitioner&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; City that&nbsp; they&nbsp; resumed their&nbsp; association.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the witness&nbsp; and&nbsp; the petitioner, though friends and&nbsp; "compadres," have not been actually in close and continuous&nbsp; contact since the time they came to know each other so as&nbsp; to afford him&nbsp; (the&nbsp; witness)&nbsp; the opportunity to&nbsp; observe his conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; witness had&nbsp; moved&nbsp; from place to place. He was&nbsp; in the Army in 1936&nbsp; stationed&nbsp; in Surigao where he&nbsp; came to&nbsp; know the&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; During&nbsp; the Japanese occupation he&nbsp; did&nbsp; not meet the petitioner.&nbsp; And it&nbsp; was only in 1952 that they resumed their association in Cebu City where the petitioner had built&nbsp; a house.<br><br>Counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; claims&nbsp; that nowhere in the testimony&nbsp; of the witness may be found&nbsp; the statement that he and&nbsp; the petitioner resumed their social contact in 1952.&nbsp; Counsel contends that&nbsp; what the witness testified is that "after&nbsp; the&nbsp; Japanese occupation we&nbsp; again had&nbsp; our close relationship."&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp;&nbsp; according&nbsp; to counsel,&nbsp; they resumed contact or association after the Japanese occupation or from 1945.&nbsp; There is no evidence that Dr. Bernardo&nbsp;&nbsp; lived elsewhere than in&nbsp; Cebu City after liberation.&nbsp; On the other hand, there is&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; that the appellee lived in Cebu City from 1927 to&nbsp; 1931 and from&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; to&nbsp; 28 February 1955, the date of hearing.&nbsp; Therefore, the logical inference is that they resumed such contact in 1952.&nbsp; The ten-year requirement&nbsp; of knowledge&nbsp; and&nbsp; observation,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petitioner's life,&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; and&nbsp; character by the supporting witness Dr. Eduardo A.&nbsp; Bernardo has&nbsp; not been met and satisfied.<br><br>The second supporting&nbsp; witness has a scanty knowledge of the petitioner's conduct and reputation.&nbsp; True he came to know him in 1931 or 1932 in Cebu City while he (the petitioner) was a young&nbsp; man.&nbsp; But&nbsp; again, the petitioner in his petition alleges that from&nbsp; 1931 to&nbsp; 1941 he was&nbsp; a resident of Butuan City and not of Cebu&nbsp; City.&nbsp; How, then, could the&nbsp; witness account for the petitioner's good conduct and reputation during all that time?&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only in 1952 when the petitioner began to reside in Cebu City and&nbsp; from&nbsp; then up to the time the witness&nbsp; testified&nbsp; in Court that he used to meet the petitioner in the streets of Cebu City, but that&nbsp; has&nbsp; no&nbsp; knowledge of&nbsp; his&nbsp; (the petitioner's)&nbsp; business&nbsp; activities and&nbsp; social dealings with the&nbsp; Filipinos.&nbsp; These&nbsp; two supporting witnesses are not, therefore,&nbsp; qualified and competent.<br><br>The testimony of Francisco M. Rosca,&nbsp; introduced at the hearing over the objection of the Fiscal, is&nbsp; of&nbsp; no value because he has not been mentioned in the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for naturalization, which shall set forth the&nbsp; names and postoffice addresses of such&nbsp; witnesses as the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; might desire to introduce at the hearing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> and their names included&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; publication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; observation made by this Court in Karam Singh vs. Republic,&nbsp; supra, is&nbsp; in point.<br><blockquote>For obvious reasons, in&nbsp; order that an imposition&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be made upon the Court, it is necessary that the Government be informed in advance .of the witnesses by whom or by whose testimonies a petitioner&nbsp; for naturalization seeks to prove&nbsp; that&nbsp; lie possesses the qualifications and none of the disqualifications&nbsp; enumerated in the law.&nbsp; Without previous investigation, it is difficult, if not&nbsp; impossible, on the part of the Government to deter,mine if the witness had already known&nbsp; or&nbsp; had the occasion or opportunity to know the petitioner and for&nbsp; such a period of time as may qualify him to testify on the petitioner's&nbsp; character, conduct and&nbsp; actuations during&nbsp; the entire period of his stay in&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp; The Government&nbsp; must have time to&nbsp; investigate, prior to the hearing, where the expected witness&nbsp; had&nbsp; lived- during the&nbsp; period of time that an applicant has lived in the Philippines.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Government must also have&nbsp; time to investigate the real character of the&nbsp; witnesses, that they may not make impositions&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; Court hearing the petition.&nbsp; A&nbsp; hearing without&nbsp; such preparation&nbsp; on the part of the Government would not be a fair hearing.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pp. 5174-5175.)</blockquote>Substitution of&nbsp; witness&nbsp; in case of death&nbsp; of.one&nbsp; of the supporting- witnesses may be allowed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> but not&nbsp; where both witnesses are alive and&nbsp; have not known the petitioner for a period of ten&nbsp; years.<br><br>The&nbsp; decree appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; reversed and the petition denied, without prejudice,&nbsp; with costs against the appellee. <br><br><i>Bengzon, MontemaYor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,.
