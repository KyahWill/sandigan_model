				<H3>BERNARDO VELASQUEZ, PETITIONER, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Habeas corpus proceeding. Petitioner Bernardo Velasquez alleges he has been 
in prison since June, 1944, pursuant to an order of the Zambales court of first 
instance, pending the revision of his case by this Court, to which he had 
appealed in May, same year. He asserts that his incarceration for more than two 
years and six months violates his constitutional right to speedy trial, and 
that, as a consequence, the Government, in failing to act with dispatch on the 
matter, lost its authority to detain him further.
<p>Answering the petition, the Solicitor General, for respondent, explains: (1) 
the prisoner is confined under a commitment order of the aforesaid court, dated 
May 8, 1944, in accordance with its decision sentencing him, for murder, to life 
imprisonment and to pay P2,000 as indemnity, with costs; (2) appeal from said 
decision was interposed, but on July 13, 1944, defendant filed with this Court a 
motion withdrawing such appeal; and (3) supposing that such appeal is still 
pending despite the withdrawal, petitioner has no reason to protest because he 
has taken no steps to reconstitute the records of his case. The Solicitor 
General submitted a copy of the judgment of conviction.</p>
<p>Petitioner filed a reply, but did not traverse the respondent's main 
allegations, specially that concerning the withdrawal of his appeal, which 
consequently must be deemed admitted. (<i>See</i> Rule 102, section 13.) And we 
have no record of the proceedings against petitioner in the Zambales court; it 
must have been destroyed together with many others during the battle for the 
liberation of Manila.</p>
<p>Now then, inasmuch as petitioner is restrained of his liberty by virtue of a 
judgment or order of a court of record, whose jurisdiction is unquestioned, the 
writ may not be issued, because section 4 of Rule 102 expressly prohibits the 
issuance thereof, in the circumstances.</p>
<p>Nor is petitioner in a position to complain of unjustified delay in the 
disposal of his appeal, because he desisted from such appeal, and even granting 
that the withdrawal had not been acted upon, the delay is due to the publicly 
known destruction of court papers, as above stated, and partly to his failure to 
apply for the reconstruction of his <i>expediente</i>, supposing, as he affirms, 
that his voluntary desistance did not finally end it.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the preceding remarks do not necessarily 
imply unqualified endorsement of the petitioner's underlying hypothesis, to wit, 
that defendant's right to speedy trial guaranteed by the Constitution extends to 
and governs proceedings in the appellate courts. This is an angle which is 
unnecessary to explore for the present, because conceding validity to his 
supposition and major premise, we find here no such inexcusable violation of 
defendant's privileges as to require vindication in the form of a directive for 
his immediate release, as was authorized in Conde <i>vs</i>. Rivera and Unson 
(45 Phil., 650), and analogous decisions.</p>
<p>Wherefore, without prejudice to the reconstitution of the original record 
which the parties may institute, the petition for the writ of habeas corpus is 
denied. No costs.</p><i>Moran C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Briones,</i> and 
<i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Upon the very facts alleged in respondent's return, without considering 
petitioner's allegations, we are of opinion that petitioner is illegally 
deprived of his liberty and, therefore, is entitled to be immediately 
released.</p>
<p>Respondent alleges that petitioner is confined by virtue of a commitment 
issued on May 8, 1944, by the clerk of the Court of First Instance of Zambales 
in which it is stated that petitioner had been convicted of murder and sentenced 
to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>; that petitioner appealed from the said decision 
but on July 13, 1944, he filed a motion withdrawing his appeal; that it does not 
appear that a record of petitioner's appeal obtains in the files of the Supreme 
Court or that petitioner has taken steps for the reconstitution of the records 
of his case against the possibility that said records were among those destroyed 
during the war.</p>
<p>Upon these allegations, petitioner appears to be deprived of his liberty by 
vitrue of a judicial process obtained during and under the Japanese regime in 
1944, and, as we have expressed in our opinion in the Co Kim Cham case (75 
Phil., 113), said judicial process is among those we declared null and void by 
virtue of a proclamation issued by General Douglas MacArthur upon his landing in 
Leyte. Whether petitioner's appeal is still pending or has been withdrawn is 
immaterial in view of this conclusion.</p>
<p>Even without considering the nullifying effects of MacArthur's proclamation, 
there is ground to conclude that petitioner is a victim of unjustified and 
unjustifiable delay in the administration of justice. If he has withdrawn his 
appeal on July 13, 1944, there is no justification why such withdrawal should 
remain unacted upon for two and a half years. If it was not withdrawn, the delay 
in the disposal of the appeal is also unjustified and unreasonable.</p>
<p>Respondent assumes that if the records of the appeal were destroyed during 
the war, it is the petitioner who should be blamed for not moving for 
reconstitution. The position is wrong. The initiative in criminal cases comes 
and should come from the prosecution. The burden of pressing criminal cases 
rests on the prosecution's shoulders. The accused is in the defense. As in all 
conflicts, no one expects that the initiative should come from the defense. The 
maxim that the best defense is offense is just a paradoxical logodaedaly. An 
alleged defender who starts a conflict by offensive action, ceases to be a 
defender, to become an aggressor.</p>
<p>The duty of prosecuting offenders is one of those imposed on all governments, 
to keep social order. The position of the accused is only one of resistance. 
Whether static or d3rnamic, it is always characterized by passivity in matters 
of initiative to push the case to an end. The prosecution is duty bound not only 
to prosecute offenders but also to have criminal cases disposed of as early as 
possible. It is against the nature of things to expect the accused to push the 
case to an early termination. A law that runs against common sense is bad law. 
If the case has not been reconstituted, it is the prosecution's fault. The 
accused should not be made to suffer for a neglect of the prosecution. The 
failure to move for reconstitution shows a dereliction of official duty of the 
proper officers of the government.</p>
<p>Under the Constitution, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy 
the right "to have a speedy and public trial," (section 1, Article III) and 
"speedy trial" means early disposal of a case, including prompt rendition of a 
final and executory decision or judgment. The word "trial" as used by the 
Constitution includes hearing, reception of evidence, and other processes, such 
as decision in the first instance, appeal, and final and executory decision in 
last instance. To exclude the final decision is to make of the constitutional 
guarantee a mocking nonsense. The guarantee will absolutely serve no purpose if 
tribunals could keep criminal cases pending for years and decades by failing to 
render final decision, whether because of laziness or lack of sense of duty or 
for fraudulent or criminal neglect.</p>
<p>Petitioner complains with reason that he has been undergoing preventive 
imprisonment since June 14, 1944, and that his right to an immediate and final 
disposal of his case has been violated by long and painful delay.</p>
<p>We vote, therefore, that petitioner be immediately released from respondent's 
custody.</p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>I concur in the foregoing dissent of Mr. 
Justice Perfecto.</div>
