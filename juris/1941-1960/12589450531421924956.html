				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; under section 18, of&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 4, Republic Act No. 1125, by the Collector of Internal Revenue, from that&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the judgment rendered&nbsp; by the Court&nbsp; of Tax&nbsp; Appeals holding&nbsp; Orlando V.&nbsp; Calsado free from income tax liability for the year 1949.<br><br>The appellant&nbsp; refused to recognize the appellee as head of a family&nbsp; within the meaning of&nbsp; section 23 (<i>b</i>) of the National Internal Revenue Code&nbsp; (Commonwealth Act No. 466, as amended by Republic Act No. 590)&nbsp; and assessed his income tax liability for the years&nbsp; 1947 at P9.41, 1949 at P40.19, 1950&nbsp; at P55 and 1951 at P19.67&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 29, record of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case; Exhibit 5).&nbsp; The appellee admitted his income tax liability for the&nbsp; years 1947 and 1951&nbsp; in the respective&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; assessed but&nbsp; denied liability for the years 1949 and 1950 on the ground that,&nbsp; as an unmarried head of a family with a brother below 21&nbsp; years&nbsp; old mainly&nbsp; dependent upon&nbsp; him for support,&nbsp; his&nbsp; exemptions are over and above his&nbsp; net income.&nbsp;&nbsp; He paid under protest the sum of P55. Thereafter&nbsp; he sought to&nbsp; recover the sum thus paid&nbsp; (Exhibits B,&nbsp; E&nbsp; &amp; F).&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellant denied his request&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that the appellee did not actually&nbsp; maintain&nbsp; a house and exercise family control over his dependents, and&nbsp; insisted on&nbsp; collecting from&nbsp; him the unpaid sums assessed and&nbsp; penalties thereunder (Exhibit 5).&nbsp; He appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals.&nbsp; Upon an&nbsp; agreed statement&nbsp; of facts,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; held that—<br><blockquote>* * * the claim for refund&nbsp; of the sum of P55.00 as&nbsp; income tax for 1950&nbsp; alleged to have been&nbsp; illegally&nbsp; and erroneously&nbsp; collected is hereby dismissed for lack of jurisdiction&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Court to entertain the same<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">.[1]</sup>  With&nbsp; respect to the tax assessment of P40.10 for the year&nbsp; 1949, still&nbsp; uncollected and&nbsp; protested, the respondent's assessment therefor is hereby reversed&nbsp; and petitioner is hereby declared free from liability thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without pronouncement as to costs.<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue has&nbsp; appealed.&nbsp; The Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals&nbsp; found:<br><blockquote>In the income&nbsp; tax return filed by the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; for the year 1949&nbsp; (Exh. "2")» it appears that&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; had a taxable net income of F2,339.50;&nbsp; and in his income tax&nbsp; return&nbsp; for the year 1950,&nbsp; (Exh. "3"), there appears a taxable net&nbsp; income of P2.892.00. The petitioner has a brother, Abelardo Calsado, then 19 years of age in 1949 and&nbsp; a sister,&nbsp; Angeles Calsado of&nbsp; legal&nbsp; age, both of whom lived with petitioner and were fully dependent on the latter for&nbsp; education and support during the taxable years 1949 and 1950. (Pars. 2 and 3,&nbsp; Stipulation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Facts).&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; tax&nbsp; assessment of P55.00 for 1950 has been paid under protest on&nbsp; May 15 and&nbsp; August 15, 1951, under Official Receipt, Nos. 90788 and 348042 respectively, and refund thereof has been requested&nbsp; on May 16, 1951, (Exhibit "F", and par. 8,&nbsp; Stipulation of Facts).&nbsp; Furthermore, the&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; for the year&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; in the sum of P40.19 has&nbsp; also been contested by petitioner (Exhibit "A", par. 9, Stipulation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Facts).<br><br>The decision of the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; regarding the claim for refund and the protest on the assessment&nbsp; (Exhibit "5")&nbsp; from&nbsp; which appeal has been taken is dated February 15, 1955, but it does not appear in the record nor has evidence been adduced as to when petitioner received a copy of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; we assume&nbsp; that the petitioner filed his petition for&nbsp; review within the 80-day period&nbsp; following the receipt&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said decision,<br><br>As provided1 for by the Income Tax Law, the personal&nbsp; exemption then enforced in 1949 for an unmarried person was&nbsp; P1,000.00&nbsp; and P2,000.00 (P2,500.00, see Republic Act No. 82) for a married person or head of&nbsp; a family&nbsp; and in&nbsp; the year 1950, the personal&nbsp; exemption allowed&nbsp; an unmarried person was&nbsp; P1,800.00,&nbsp; and for a married person or head of a family, P3,000.00.<br><br>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * that during the taxable years 1949 and l©50,&nbsp; the petitioner had two&nbsp; dependents,&nbsp; one a minor brother&nbsp; and the other a&nbsp; sister, both being&nbsp; fully dependent upon him for&nbsp; support and education; that petitioner and his dependents rented a home for their residence in Pasay; that both dependents were&nbsp; jobless;&nbsp; that&nbsp; during 1949 and&nbsp; 1950, petitioner's father was earning a meager monthly salary of P110.00 and was&nbsp; in&nbsp; turn supporting his&nbsp; wife and&nbsp; two&nbsp; minor children,&nbsp; all of whom were&nbsp; likewise wholly dependent&nbsp; upon petitioner's father for support;&nbsp; that&nbsp; on&nbsp; account of the financial&nbsp; limitation of petitioner's father, the father seldom, if&nbsp; at all, sent money to his&nbsp; son and daughter in Manila living with petitioner;&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; having the&nbsp; means&nbsp; to do&nbsp; so out&nbsp; of&nbsp; his monthly income of P225.0O, he undertook to provide the entire support of his brother and sister first above-mentioned, then under his control.<br></blockquote>And it held—<br><blockquote>* * * that under&nbsp; the facts as&nbsp; stated above, the&nbsp; petitioner is included within&nbsp; the&nbsp; term "head&nbsp; of a family"&nbsp; as contemplated in section 23,&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; (b) of the Tax Code,&nbsp; as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 2.&nbsp; We believe that the petitioner, under the circumstances was at least legally obliged to give&nbsp; support to his minor brother, in view of the financial inability of his&nbsp; parents to so provide support&nbsp; (Arts. 294, 295 and 299, Civil&nbsp; Code)&nbsp; and having&nbsp; actually&nbsp; maintained&nbsp; such&nbsp; support, placed the&nbsp; petitioner squarely within the purview of the aforecited provisions&nbsp; of the Tax Code.&nbsp; The petitioner is therefore entitled&nbsp; to claim the benefits of the corresponding personal exemption as "head&nbsp; of a&nbsp; family" for the years 1949 and&nbsp; 1950, with the result that considering these exemptions&nbsp; in relations of the income of petitioner as declared in his income&nbsp; tax&nbsp; returns&nbsp; (Exhs.&nbsp; "2"&nbsp; and "3"),&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; has no taxable&nbsp; income upon which&nbsp; an&nbsp; income tax&nbsp; liability may arise. <br></blockquote>Section&nbsp; 23&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; of the National Internal Revenue Code, as&nbsp; amended, defines&nbsp; the&nbsp; term "head of&nbsp; a family" as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>* * * For the purpose of this section, the&nbsp; term&nbsp; "head of&nbsp; a family" includes&nbsp; an unmarried&nbsp; man or woman with&nbsp; one or both parents, or&nbsp; one&nbsp; or more brothers or sisters, or one or more legitimate, recognized natural, or adopted children&nbsp; dependent upon&nbsp; him or&nbsp; her&nbsp; for their chief&nbsp; support&nbsp; where&nbsp; such&nbsp; brothers,&nbsp; sisters, or children are less than twenty-one years of age * * *.<br></blockquote>For&nbsp; an unmarried individual to&nbsp; fall within&nbsp; the term "head of&nbsp; a family"&nbsp; under the&nbsp; aforequoted provision, it is&nbsp; enough&nbsp; that he has&nbsp; either of the&nbsp; following who is dependent upon him for his chief&nbsp; support: a father or mother or both, one&nbsp; or more brothers or sisters, one or more legitimate, recognized&nbsp; natural or&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; children, provided&nbsp; that&nbsp; such&nbsp; brother,&nbsp; sister&nbsp; or&nbsp; child is&nbsp; less than 21 years&nbsp; of age.&nbsp; The Court of Tax Appeals found "that during the taxable years&nbsp; 1949&nbsp; and 1950,&nbsp; the petitioner (now&nbsp; appellee)&nbsp; had&nbsp; two dependents, one a&nbsp; minor brother and the other a sister, both being fully&nbsp; dependent upon him for&nbsp; support&nbsp; and education;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that his father is&nbsp; still&nbsp; alive and continues to exercise parental authority&nbsp; over his minor children is of no moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; All that the law requires in order that an unmarried individual may be considered as head of a family is that the relatives enumerated be dependent upon him for their chief support.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
