				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; for mandamus&nbsp; and certiorari with preliminary injunction seeking to compel respondent Court to deliver to&nbsp; petitioners the sum of P500.00 representing the cash bond&nbsp; they&nbsp; filed incident to&nbsp; the issuance of the writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction issued in a&nbsp; case&nbsp; pending before said Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>This petition stems from a case&nbsp; of forcible entry filed by Ismael Sanchez against Carlos Curilan, et al. before the Municipal&nbsp; Court of Butuan&nbsp; City.&nbsp; The case was decided in favor of plaintiff, defendants having been ordered to vacate the properly.&nbsp; Defendants failed to&nbsp; perfect their appeal within&nbsp; the reglementary period and so&nbsp; plaintiff asked for execution of the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dependants filed a petition&nbsp; for relief before the court of first instance&nbsp; which&nbsp; was dismissed for lack of merit.&nbsp; They tried to appeal the order&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; but while&nbsp; action on&nbsp; the appeal was pending&nbsp; defendants filed with the same court a petition&nbsp; for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction alleging abuse of discretion on the part of the lower&nbsp; court.&nbsp; The writ&nbsp; of preliminary&nbsp; injunction was granted&nbsp; upon the filing of a bond&nbsp; in The sum of P500.00. Petitioners put&nbsp; up the bond in cash which was deposited with the Disbursing Officer of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In due time the Court of Appeals entered judgment dismissing the petition and dissolving the&nbsp; preliminary injunction, and&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; having become final&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clerk of Court made&nbsp; an&nbsp; entry of said&nbsp; judgment on&nbsp; January 17,&nbsp; 1957. <br><br>On March&nbsp; 4, 1957, petitioners filed a motion to withdraw the cash bond on the ground that the judgment has become final, which was reiterated in a subsequent motion, for the reason that no action&nbsp; has been taken&nbsp; on the first-motion. But on July&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; respondent Sanchez filed&nbsp; a motion praying for the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of the bond put up by petitioners to answer for the damages he had suffered arising&nbsp; from the preliminary&nbsp; injunction issued by the Court of Appeals considering that the petition for certiorari has been dismissed&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; merit.&nbsp; Respondent&nbsp; Court&nbsp; at first granted&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion for withdrawal of the cash bond but it later stayed its order while&nbsp; at the&nbsp; same time it denied the motion of respondent Sanchez <span style="font-style: italic;">without prejudice&nbsp; on his part to file&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; action for damages in the&nbsp; lower court.</span>&nbsp; This resolution&nbsp; entered on August 26, 1957 is&nbsp; now the subject&nbsp; of the present petition for&nbsp; mandamus. <br><br>It appears that the&nbsp; cash bond of P500.00 was put up by petitioners in relation to the writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction issued by respondent Court upon&nbsp; their petition in the certiorari case then pending before said court.&nbsp; It likewise appears&nbsp; that the certiorari case&nbsp; was&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; for lack of merit and the decision became final on&nbsp; January&nbsp; 17, 1957. But notwithstanding the fact that said decision has become final without respondent Sanchez having filed any claim for damages arising from the issuance of the preliminary injunction <span style="font-style: italic;">with notice to the surety,</span> respondent Court entered a&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; allowing Sanchez to file the corresponding action for damages&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court. Petitioners now claim that respondent Court in granting such relief to Sanchez&nbsp; has&nbsp; committed a grave&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; of discretion.<br><br>Section 9, Rule 60 provides:&nbsp; <br><blockquote>"Sec. 9. <span style="font-style: italic;">Judgment to&nbsp; damages&nbsp; against party&nbsp; and sureties</span>.—Upon the trial the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, or to the defendant, as the case may be, upon the bond of {he other party, shall be&nbsp; claimed, ascertained,&nbsp; and&nbsp; awarded under the same procedure&nbsp; as prescribed&nbsp; in Section 20 of Rule 59."<br></blockquote>Section 20, Rule&nbsp; 59 provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 20. <span style="font-style: italic;">Claim for damages on&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; bond on account&nbsp; of illegal attachment.</span>—If the judgment on the action be in favor of the defendant, he may&nbsp; recover,&nbsp; upon the bond given by the plaintiff, damages resulting from the attachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such damages may be awarded only upon&nbsp; application and after proper hearing, and shall be included in&nbsp; the&nbsp; final judgment.&nbsp; The application&nbsp; must be filed before the trial or, in the discretion of the court, before1 entry of the final judgment, with due&nbsp; notice to the plaintiff and his surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to damages and the amount thereof.&nbsp; Damages sustained during the pendency of&nbsp; an appeal may be claimed by the defendant, if the judgment of the appellate court&nbsp; be&nbsp; favorable to&nbsp; him, by filing an application therewith, with notice to the plaintiff and his surety or sureties, and the appellate court may allow the application&nbsp; to be&nbsp; heard and&nbsp; decided by the trial court."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; appears from the above provisions&nbsp; that&nbsp; whenever a bond is filed&nbsp; because of&nbsp; the&nbsp; issuance of a preliminary&nbsp; injunction and damages are suffered as a result thereof the claim for damages must be filed "before the trial or, in the discretion of&nbsp; the court, before entry of the final judgment, with due notice&nbsp; to plaintiff and his&nbsp; surety&nbsp; or sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to damages and the&nbsp; amount thereof."&nbsp; It likewise appears that&nbsp; such damages may be awarded&nbsp; only upon&nbsp; application and after proper hearing, and shall be Included in the final judgment. And&nbsp; it has been held that this remedy is exclusive and by failing to file a motion for the determination of the damages on time and while the judgment is still under the control of the court, the claimant loses his right to such damages.<br><br>It appearing that&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; in the main&nbsp; case&nbsp; has become final and respondent Sanchez has failed to file his claim for damages on time or while his case is still under the control of the court, it follows that his claim to such damages is now lost and the liability of the surety on the bond extinguished. <br><br>Wherefore, the resolution of respondent Court entered on&nbsp; August 26, 1957&nbsp; is hereby set aside in&nbsp; so far as&nbsp; it grants respondent Sanchez the right to file a separate action for damages in the lower court.&nbsp; It is ordered that the cash&nbsp; bond&nbsp; of P500.00&nbsp; be returned&nbsp; to petitioners.&nbsp; Cost against respondent Sanchez. <br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Concepcion, Labrador, Endencia,</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
