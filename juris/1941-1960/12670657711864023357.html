				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff is the owner and manager of a gasoline station located in the City of Lipa where&nbsp; gasoline, kerosene, oil and the like are sold.&nbsp; He paid&nbsp; under protest to&nbsp; the city treasurer&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; period from&nbsp; October&nbsp; 24, 1952 to September 30, 1953 the aggregate sum of P733.84 as taxes levied under Ordinance No. 457-A, as&nbsp; amended by Ordiance No. 462, imposing one-tenth&nbsp; 1/10)&nbsp; centavo per liter on the sale of gasoline and one-half&nbsp; (1/2) centavo per liter on the sale of alcohol, gas, or petroleum that may be made in any store or establishment within the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; To recover the amount paid on the ground that the two ordinances are ultra vires, he brought the present action in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Batangas.&nbsp; The City&nbsp; of Lipa put&nbsp; up the defense that the ordinances are valid because they were enacted&nbsp; pursuant to the&nbsp; power grantee} to&nbsp; it by the Charter,&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 162.<p>The parties submitted a joint motion for judgment on the pleadings, and on May 27,&nbsp; 1954, the&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered judgment declaring the ordinances ultra vires and&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; defendant to reimburse to plaintiff&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P733.84&nbsp; and&nbsp; such other&nbsp; fees as plaintiff&nbsp; may have paid after the filing of the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant took the case directly&nbsp; to this Court.</p><p>Ordinance No. 457-A, as amended by Ordinance No. 462, of the City of Lipa, provides in section 1&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"SECTION 1.—There is&nbsp; hereby imposed a tax of one tenth (1/10) centavo per liter on the sale of gasoline and one-half (1/2)&nbsp; centavo per liter on the sale of alcohol, gas, petroleum, or all of any&nbsp; kindred type of combustible&nbsp; liquid&nbsp; made&nbsp; in&nbsp; any&nbsp; store or&nbsp; establishment by any person or entity within&nbsp; the City of Lipa."</p></blockquote><p>The above ordinances were enacted pursuant to section 15, paragraph (<em>p</em>), of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 162, otherwise known as Charter of the City of&nbsp; Lipa, which reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"SEC. 15. General powers&nbsp; and duties&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board.—-Except as otherwise provided&nbsp; by law, and subject to the conditions&nbsp; and limitations thereof,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Board&nbsp; shall have&nbsp; the&nbsp; following legislative powers:&nbsp; </p><p>(<em>p</em>) To tax, fix the license fee for, regulate the business and fix the location of, match factories, blacksmith shops, foundries, steam boilers, lumber yards, shipyards, the storage and&nbsp; sale of gunpowder, tar,&nbsp; pitch,&nbsp; resin,&nbsp; coal,&nbsp; oil, gasoline, benzine,&nbsp; turpentine,&nbsp; hemp, cotton, nitroglycerine, petroleum, or any of the products thereof, and of all&nbsp; other highly combustible or&nbsp; explosive&nbsp; materials, and other establishments likely to&nbsp; endanger&nbsp; the&nbsp; public safety&nbsp; or&nbsp; give&nbsp; rise to conflagrations&nbsp; or explosion,&nbsp; and, subject to the rules and regulations issued by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Health in&nbsp; accordance with law, tanneries,&nbsp;&nbsp; renderies,&nbsp; tallow&nbsp;&nbsp; chandleries,&nbsp; embalmers, and scrap factories."</p></blockquote><p>It is clear from the above that the City of Lipa is given the power and authority (1) to tax,&nbsp; (2) to fix the license fee for,&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; to regulate the business, and&nbsp; (4) to fix the location of * * * the storage and sale of oil, gasoline and the like.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; it is given the power to tax, fix the license&nbsp; fee&nbsp; for, or regulate the business&nbsp; affecting match&nbsp; factories,&nbsp;&nbsp; blacksmith&nbsp;&nbsp; shops,&nbsp; foundries,&nbsp; steam boilers,&nbsp; lumber yards,&nbsp; shipyards,&nbsp; the&nbsp; storage&nbsp; and the sale&nbsp; of oil, gasoline, petroleum&nbsp; and&nbsp; the like.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; does not possess the&nbsp; power to impose a tax on specific articles which may take the form of specific tax.&nbsp; In order that such&nbsp; power&nbsp; may be exercised,&nbsp; the&nbsp; grant&nbsp; must be clear. It cannot be implied for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason that a municipal corporation,&nbsp; unlike&nbsp; a sovereign&nbsp; state,&nbsp; does&nbsp; not possess inherent power of&nbsp; taxation.</p><p>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; settled that a&nbsp; municipal corporation, unlike&nbsp; a sovereign state,&nbsp; is&nbsp; clothed&nbsp; with no inherent power of taxation.&nbsp; The charter or statute must plainly&nbsp; show an intent to confer that power or&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality cannot assume it. And the power when granted is&nbsp; to be construed<em> strictissimi juris</em>.&nbsp; Any&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; or ambiguity&nbsp; arising out of the term used in granting that power must be resolved against&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inferences,&nbsp; implications, deductions—all these—have&nbsp; no place&nbsp; in the interpretation of the taxing power of a municipal&nbsp; corporations.&nbsp; [Icard <em>vs</em>. City&nbsp; Council of Baguio and the City of&nbsp; Baguio, 48 Off. Gaz., (Supp. 11) 320; Medina, et al. <em>vs</em>. City of Baguio, 48 Off. Gaz., No. 11,&nbsp; 4769].</p><p>The question now to be determined is:&nbsp; Do the ordinances impose merely&nbsp; a tax on the business of selling and storing oil, gasoline, or petroleum, or a specific tax on the article therein enumerated?</p><p>We are inclined to uphold the latter view for the reason that&nbsp; the tax which&nbsp; they seek&nbsp; to collect&nbsp; is&nbsp; Imposed by "some standard of weight&nbsp; or measurement"&nbsp; and not regardless of it.&nbsp; Thus, the tax&nbsp; imposed is&nbsp; y10&nbsp; centavo per liter&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale of gasoline and i&nbsp; centavo per liter on the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of alcohol,&nbsp; gas, or petroleum.&nbsp; And it has&nbsp; been held that "A tax which imposes a&nbsp; specific sum by the head or number, or some standard&nbsp; of weight or measurement, and which&nbsp; requires no assessment beyond a&nbsp; listing&nbsp; and classification of the&nbsp; objects to be&nbsp; taxed", is&nbsp; a&nbsp; specific tax (61 C. J.,&nbsp; 74).&nbsp; It is the sense&nbsp; that the tax on manufactured oils and other fuels is imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code (section 142, Commonwealth Act No. 466, as amended by section 11, Republic Act No. 56).&nbsp;&nbsp; The tax&nbsp; is considered a&nbsp; specific tax&nbsp; if the amount is imposed per&nbsp;&nbsp; liter&nbsp; of&nbsp; volume&nbsp; capacity."&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is therefore&nbsp; plain that the enactment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinances&nbsp; in&nbsp; question is ultra&nbsp; vires.</p><p>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; a marked&nbsp; parallelism&nbsp; between the case of Medina,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al. <em>vs</em>.,City&nbsp; of Baguio, supra and the&nbsp; present case.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; Medina case we said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"An examination&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 2553 (<em>c</em>), of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code, as amended,&nbsp; will reveal that the power given to the City of Baguio&nbsp; to tax, to&nbsp; license&nbsp; and to regulate only refers to the business&nbsp; of the taxpayer and not to the&nbsp; articles used in said business.&nbsp; This is clearly inferred&nbsp; from a reading of said&nbsp; section and&nbsp; from the concluding sentence&nbsp; appearing&nbsp; therein, to wit, 'and such other businesses, trades and occupations as may be established or practised&nbsp; in. the City.'&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason&nbsp; for this undoubtedly is the fact that under section&nbsp; 142&nbsp; of the Internal Revenue Code (Commonwealth Act No. 466, as amended by the Republic Act No. 39), most of the products mentioned&nbsp; in the charter, particularly gasoline and oil,&nbsp; are already specifically&nbsp; taxed,&nbsp; and under section&nbsp; 361&nbsp; of said code, the City of Baguio gets a share of 20 per cent of the amount of specific tax collected.&nbsp; At any rate, the&nbsp; charter of the City of Baguio does not show plainly an intent to confer&nbsp; that power upon the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Baguio and,&nbsp; following the rule&nbsp; already&nbsp; adverted to, this doubt or ambiguity must be&nbsp; resolved against the city. An indication of the legislative intent on this matter is Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 472&nbsp; which&nbsp; confers general&nbsp; authority&nbsp; upon&nbsp; municipal councils to&nbsp; levy taxes,&nbsp; subject to certain&nbsp; limitations,&nbsp; wherein it was specifically provided that the general&nbsp; authority so conferred shall not&nbsp; include 'percentage taxes and taxes&nbsp; on&nbsp; specified articles.' In other words, the power&nbsp; to levy a percentage tax or a specified tax&nbsp; has been expressly withheld.&nbsp; It is, therefore, our considered opinion that Ordinance No. 100 is ultra&nbsp; vire&nbsp; and has no force and effect."</p></blockquote><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed,</p><p>without pronouncement as to costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J. Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.

No.&nbsp; L-9167, We&nbsp; Wa Yu <em>vs</em>. City&nbsp; of Lipa, acting in the motion for reconsideration filed by appellant, the Court adopted the following resolution:</p><p>Considering that&nbsp; on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1956 Congress enacted Republic Act No. 1435 providing in section 4 that Municipal boards of&nbsp; councils may,&nbsp; notwithstanding the provisions of&nbsp; sections one hundred&nbsp; and&nbsp; forty-two&nbsp; and&nbsp; one hundred and forty-five of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code, as herein above amended, levy&nbsp; an additional tax of not exceeding twenty-five&nbsp; percent of the rates&nbsp; fixed in said sections, on manufactured oils sold or distributed with in the limits of&nbsp; the city or municipality";</p><p>Considering that municipal taxes&nbsp; heretofore levied&nbsp; by the city councils on gasoline, airplane fuel, lubricating oil and other fuels, were ratified and declared valid by said Act&nbsp; (Section 4);</p><p>Considering that&nbsp; the tax imposed by the ordinances in question&nbsp; does not go beyond the limit of&nbsp; twenty-five per cent of the rates prescribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; section 142&nbsp; and 145 of the National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code;</p><p>Considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; revenue&nbsp; acts, retroactively&nbsp; applied, are not open to the objection that they infringe upon the due process of law clause of the Constitution&nbsp; (Republic of the Philippines&nbsp; <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Angelina Oasan, et al., supra, p. 934) ;</p><p>The decision of this Court dated September 27, 1956 is hereby modified by reversing the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from and dismissing the&nbsp; case, without costs.</p></div>
