				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The accused in this case stands charged with murder. The 
evidence for the prosecution shows that in the afternoon of September 22, 1944, 
the barrio of Talaga, municipality of Argao, Province of Cebu, was celebrating 
its local fiesta. Gathered in its cockpit was a large crowd, who indulged not 
only in cockfighting but also in a game they call hantak, which m similar to 
cara y cruz. Among the participants in that game were Aguedo Camillo, Antonio 
Ortega and Dionisio Sombilon. Aguedo was flipping the coins, while Antonio was 
handling the bets for him. After winning about P40, Aguedo decided to quit. 
Dionisio objected to Aguedo's quitting when he himself was losing and voiced his 
objection by asking Aguedo: "Why stop playing when I still have money?" Provoked 
by this remark, Aguedo replied, "Why control a gambler's actions?" and then 
boxed Dionisio, hitting him in the mouth. He was about to give Dionisio another 
fist blow when Ortega intervened and pacified the two. Hardly had Aguedo 
separated from Dionisio, however, when the former withdrew from the crowd and 
called to his followers, saying: "Where are my boys, come here to rae." As if in 
answer to the call, several persons were seen to rally around Aguedo, one of 
them being the now deceased, Julian Camahalan. Sensing trouble, Apolonio 
Sombilon, brother of Dionisio, hurriedly followed Julian and stabbed him from 
behind with a dagger. Wounded in the back, Julian staggered, ran a distance of 
about 50 meters, sat down and died. 
<p align="justify">The above facts were established by the testimony of three 
eye-witnesses, while the doctor who examined the cadaver of Julian Camahalan 
gave the opinion that the wound he found in the latter's back was the cause of 
his death.</p>

<p align="justify">Testifying in his defense, the accused denied having been the 
one who stabbed the deceased. He admitted being in the cockpit on that occasion 
and having even seen his brother Dionisio with face bleeding and shaking hands 
with Aguedo. But he claimed that he did not see the stabbing, which, according 
to him, took place some time afterward, when he was already inside the ring, 
holding his rooster with its gaff attached and ready to fight the opposing 
rooster held by Jose de la Pena. He said that he was thus occupied when he 
noticed that there was an uproar and people were shouting from the outside: "There is a fight, and the Japanese are coming." Fearing the 
Japanese and seeing other people run away, he did likewise.</p>
<p align="justify">The accused was corroborated by Juan Templa, a <span style="font-style: italic;">compadre</span> of his 
brother Dionisio Sombilon.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court found the accused guilty of homicide and 
sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> 
to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, to indemnify the heirs of 
the deceased in the sum of P2,000, to suffer the accessory penalties, and to pay 
the costs. From this judgment, the accused has appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
But that court has certified the case here, being of the opinion that the 
accused is guilty of murder and should be sentenced to life imprisonment. </p>
<p align="justify">The case hinges on the credibility of the witnesses. The 
defense tries to discredit the witnesses for the prosecution, but fails to point 
out any substantial flaw in their testimony. And although the accused claims 
that Antonio Ortega testified against him because he failed to continue 
supplying Mm with chickens and vegetables as he had promised, the imputation is 
denied by Ortega, and there is no showing that the latter is the kind of a man 
who, for so trivial a cause, would be capable of testifying falsely against one 
accused of so serious a crime as murder. On the other hand, the testimony of 
defense witness Juan Templa does not inspire much confidence since he is 
admittedly a close friend of the accused, being a <span style="font-style: italic;">compadre</span> of his brother. On 
the whole, we find no reason for disturbing the findings of fact of the trial 
judge, who was in a better position to gauge the credibility of the witnesses 
after observing their demeanor on the witness stand. </p>
<p align="justify">The accused testified that while he had heard people say that 
the deceased was a trouble-maker, he himself had never had any "disgusto" with 
him, for they had not even met. And it is now argued by counsel that the accused 
could have had no motive for killing the deceased. But we "think that the 
unlawful aggression was sufficiently explained by the witness Antonio Ortega, 
who, in answer to a question of the court, declared that the accused stabbed the 
deceased because his brother Dionisio Sombilon was boxed by Aguedo Camillo and 
he believed that the deceased was an ally of Aguedo since he was one of those 
who rallied around the latter in answer to his call. The fact, that according to 
the accused himself, the deceased had the reputation of being a trouble-maker 
does lend weight to this theory. </p>
<p align="justify">While the lower court has found the accused guilty of mere 
homicide, we agree with the Solicitor General and the Court of Appeals that the 
crime proved is murder, qualified by treachery, as charged in the information, 
since the accused unexpectedly attacked the deceased from the rear, stabbing him 
in the back, thus employing a form of aggression which insured its execution 
without risk to himself arising from any defense which the deceased might have 
made.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the judgment below is modified in the sense that the 
accused is declared guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The 
rest of said sentence is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon,</span> 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tuason, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
