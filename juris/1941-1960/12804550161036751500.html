				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At about midnight of 22 September 1950 while Ciriaco Labrador, his 
wife Elisa Bagay and their children Leandra, Simona, Ines and Felipe, 
the first 15 and the last 5 years old, were sleeping in their house 
located in barrio No. 57, Ligsay, municipality of Laoag, province of 
Ilocos Norte, Dionisio Tapia came to the house and asked for a match 
stick.  After a while Hermenegildo Pascual and Roman Nicolas forced open
 the door, the first aiming his gun at Ciriaco Labrador and asking for 
money.  Roman Nicolas held a flashlight and took a club in the house and
 with it threatened Ciriaco Labrador.  As the latter said that he had no
 money because he had loaned it (P1,000) to Martina Ancheta, 
Hermenegildo Pascual told him that if he did not give his money he would
 kill him.  Ciriaco Labrador begged not to be killed and asked them to 
have a pity on his small children.  Hermenegildo Pascual and Roman 
Nicolas told him "Go ahead and open the trunk." Hermenegildo Pascual 
took from the trunk a chest or savings box containing P10.  He also 
asked Ciriaco to open the two drawers of the sewing machine but found no
 money there.  Then Roman Nicolas brought Ciriaco down and guarded him 
while Ricardo Corpus went up.  Meanwhile Ricardo Corpus asked Elisa 
Bagay to let him have sexual intercourse with her.  Elisa told him that 
he should not do it because she was six months on the family way.  
Ricardo Corpus in answer to that refusal pushed her, took her son from 
her, threw her on the trunk, Elisa falling on a mat on the floor, and 
there after pulling down her panties lay with her, Hermenegildo Pascual 
holding her hands.  After Corpus had satisfied his lust, Hermenegildo 
took his turn and while he was having sexual intercourse with her, 
Ricardo Corpus approached and caressed Leandra Labrador by touching her 
breast and genitals, but she pleaded not to be abused because she had 
menses.  After Hermenegildo Pascual got through he and Ricardo Corpus 
went down and left the place.  After the malefactors had left Ciriaco 
Labrador went up the house and inquired from his what the malefactors 
had done while he was down and his wife revealed to him that she had 
been raped by Ricardo Corpus and Hermenegildo Pascual.  The following 
day seized by fear that the malefactors might do them some more harm, 
they left their house in Ligsay and moved to Curarig, municipality of 
Bacarra, Ilocos Norte, and on 5 October they went to seek the advice of 
attorney Rabago on who brought them and their daughter Leandra to the P.
 C. Headquarters and there signed affidavits recounting what happened to
 them in their house at midnight of 22 September.  These affidavits were
 sworn to before the Justice of the Peace of Laoag and an information 
for robbery with rape was filed against Hermenegildo Pascual, Ricardo 
Corpus and Roman Nicolas.  After trial the court found them guilty of 
the complex crime charged, except Roman Nicolas who was found guilty of 
robbery only and sentenced to suffer 4 years of <i>prision correccional</i>
 to 8 years and 6 months of <i>prision mayor,</i> and Hermenegildo 
Pascual and Ricardo Corpus sentenced to suffer <i>reclusion perpetua,</i>
 and all the three defendants sentenced to pay jointly and severally an 
indemnity of P26 and the costs.  Only Hermenegildo Pascual and Ricardo 
Corpus have appealed.
  <p>    All the arguments and reasons advanced in support of this 
appeal revolve around the point of improbability that the witnesses for 
the prosecution had recognized the appellants.  But there is no 
improbability in their having been recognized by the victims because 
even if there was no light in the sala and in the room of the house the 
flashlight which Roman Nicolas held and used to locate Ciriaco Labrador 
and the trunk reflected upon their faces.  Besides, the appellants were 
known to the inmates of the house.  Hermenegildo Pascual had been to the
 house of Ciriaco Labrador to buy carabao meat and Ricardo Corpus is 
Ciriaco's third degree nephew and as carpenter had helped build 
Ciriaco's house.</p>
  <p>    Going over the transcript of the oral testimony given by the 
witnesses for the prosecution we noticed differences in some details, 
but some of these were due to the fact that the questions were not 
understood well and the answers were corrected after the questions were 
understood and the other differences instead of being badges of 
untruthfulness constitute signs of veracity.  Witnesses react 
differently on what they see and hear depending upon their situation and
 state of mind.  On the other hand, uniformity in details is a badge of 
untruthfulness.</p>
  <p>    The alibi set up by the appellants cannot be believed.  
Hermenegildo Pascual attempted to prove that on the night in question he
 was with Dominga de la Cruz and slept with her in barrio No. 2 of 
Laoag.  But the testimony of Dominga de la Cruz cannot be relied upon 
because she is a common prostitute and of low morals.  She gave the 
story that she had sexual intercourse three times with Hermenegildo 
Pascual that evening in a room of 5-1/2 square meters of Alejandra 
Asuncion where four other persons were sleeping.  Ricardo Corpus 
testified that he went to bed at 9:00 o'clock and slept until 4:00 
o'clock in the morning in his house located on the west side of the 
provincial high school at Laoag.  To corroborate him Ricardo Corpus 
presented as witness Juan Maximo, the barrio lieutenant of Ligsay.  But 
the testimony of Juan Maximo also cannot be believed.  He testified that
 he never had revealed to anyone what he was to testify in court, not 
even to attorney Prieto who called him to the witness stand in the 
morning of the 10th of January.</p>
  <p>    There is no evidence that a bolo, a plow, a scythe and a chisel
 were taken by the appellants except the affidavit Exhibits 1 and 2 of 
Ciriaco Labrador and Elisa Bagay, respectively.  But such exhibits were 
not presented in evidence by the prosecution but by counsel for 
Hermenegildo Pascual for the purpose of impeaching the testimony of 
Ciriaco Labrador and Elisa Bagay.</p>
  <p>    The commission of the crime was attended by the aggravating 
circumstance of nocturnity purposely sought.</p>
  <p>    The judgment appealed from being in accordance with law is 
affirmed, except as to the amount of indemnity which should be reduced 
to P10 only, with costs against the appellants.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. <i><br>
    Feria, J.,</i> no part. </p>
