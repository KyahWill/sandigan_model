				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Manila court of first&nbsp; instance,&nbsp; the Philippine National&nbsp; Bank sued the defendant upon&nbsp; a letter of credit and a&nbsp; draft&nbsp; for the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; $14,449.15.&nbsp; Although willing to pay the equivalent&nbsp; in pesos of the draft, plus bank charges,&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; objected to the&nbsp; 17%&nbsp; excise tax&nbsp; imposed by Republic Act&nbsp; No. 601&nbsp; which the Bank tried to collect.&nbsp; Both documents, he contended, had been issued and had matured <i>before the approval</i>&nbsp; of said Act, therefore&nbsp; the excise tax should not "be charged.<br><br>After trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; rendered judgment&nbsp; exempting defendant from the 17% excise tax; but ordered him to deliver to plaintiff the sum of P37,622.11 plus daily interest of P3.9938 on P29,154.55 beginning from&nbsp; January 9, 1953.<br><br>The plaintiff&nbsp; appealed, insisting on the right to collect 17% excise&nbsp; or exchange tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp; the&nbsp; only issue between the parties&nbsp; now.<br><br>For a statement of the facts we may quote&nbsp; from plaintiff's brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; "On&nbsp; October 26,&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; Defendant-Appellee applied for&nbsp; a commercial&nbsp; letter of credit with&nbsp; Plaintiff-Appellant, Philippine National&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; (Manila)&nbsp; and was granted L/C No.&nbsp; 36171 (Exhibit "B")&nbsp; on November 6, 1948, in favor of Otis Elevator Co., 260 Eleventh&nbsp; Avenue, New York City, U.S.A., for $14,449.15&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purchase of an electric passenger elevator;&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1949, and under the&nbsp; said letter of credit (Exhibit "B"), Otis Elevator Co. drew a 90 day sight draft for $14,449.15&nbsp; (Exhibit "A") which&nbsp; draft was duly presented to&nbsp; and&nbsp; accepted&nbsp; by Defendant-Appellee&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; July&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1949.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said&nbsp; acceptance matured on October&nbsp; 4, 1949.&nbsp; Upon Defendant-Appellee's signing a 90 day trust receipt (Exhibit "C")&nbsp; on June 3, 1949, Plaintiff-Appellant released to&nbsp; Defendant-Appellee the covering documents of&nbsp; the&nbsp; shipment.&nbsp; In the meantime, debit advice&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "G")&nbsp; was&nbsp; received from Plaintiff-Appellant's New York Agency to the effect that it&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; or paid&nbsp; the draft&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "A")&nbsp; to&nbsp; Otis Elevator&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; on&nbsp; May 17,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.949,&nbsp; and charged&nbsp; Plaintiff-Appellant&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; $14,467.21 representing&nbsp; the&nbsp; face value of the draft (Exhibit "A") plus $18.06 as 1/8 of 1% commission.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the&nbsp; maturity date (October&nbsp; 4, 1949) Plaintiff-Appellant presented&nbsp; the&nbsp; draft&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant-Appellee for payment but the latter failed, neglected&nbsp; and refused to pay.<br><br>During its special session in January,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; Congress passed&nbsp; House Bill&nbsp; No. 1513, now Republic Act&nbsp; No. 601, approved on March 28, 1951,&nbsp; imposing a 17% special excise tax&nbsp; (otherwise&nbsp; known as foreign exchange tax)&nbsp; on&nbsp; the value in Philippine peso of&nbsp; foreign exchange&nbsp; sold by the Central Bank of the Philippines or its authorized agents. Plaintiff-appellant,&nbsp; as any other commercial bank in&nbsp; the Philippines, is&nbsp; an authorized&nbsp; agent&nbsp; of the Central Bank of the Philippines.<br><br>On October&nbsp; 17, 1952, and January&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1958,&nbsp; Plaintiff- Appellant&nbsp; sent bills or statements of collection (Exhibits "D" and&nbsp;&nbsp; "D-l")&nbsp; to&nbsp; Defendant-Appellee&nbsp; but the&nbsp; latter failed&nbsp; and refused to&nbsp; effect payment thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; In those statements, the sum of P4,955.74 was included representing the 17% special excise tax on&nbsp; the&nbsp; peso value of the draft for US $14,449.15&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "A"), * * *."<br><br>Defendant's application for a letter of credit partly read as follows:<br><blockquote>"Please arrange by cable for the establishment of an Irrevocable Letter of Credit&nbsp; on New York in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; Otis Elevator Co., 260 Eleventh Avenue, New&nbsp; York City for account of&nbsp; Hon. Jose C. Zulueta for the sum of fourteen&nbsp; thousand four hundred FORTY- NINE AND 15/100 ($14,449.15) DOLLARS against drawn at NINETY DAYS accompanied by shipping documents covering of ONE COMPLETE ELECTRIC&nbsp; PASSENGER ELEVATOR *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *<br><br>Drafts must be drawn and presented or negotiated not later than May 31, 1949.<br><br>IN CONSIDERATION THEREOF, I/we promise and agree to pay you at maturity in Philippine Currency, the equivalent of the above amount or such portion thereof as may be drawn or paid&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; faith o£ said credit, together with your usual charges, and I/we authorize you and your respective correspondents to pay or to accept drafts under this credit, * * *"<br></blockquote>And the draft issued thereunder (Exhibit A) was negotiable and addressed to&nbsp; herein defendant as the drawee.<br><br>From plaintiff's statement of its position it is not clear whether recovery is demanded upon the letter&nbsp; of credit, or upon the draft Exhibit A.&nbsp; Plaintiff&nbsp; may,&nbsp; undoubtedly, proceed on either cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Art. 571&nbsp; Code of Commerce;&nbsp; Sec.&nbsp; 51 Negotiable&nbsp; Instruments Law.)<br><br>Had&nbsp; the plaintiff elected&nbsp; to recover&nbsp; on said letter of credit, then it would meet with the doctrines in Araneta vs. Philippine National Bank, 95 Phil.,&nbsp; 160,&nbsp; 50&nbsp; Off. Gaz., (11)&nbsp; 5350),&nbsp; According to&nbsp; the majority opinion&nbsp; in&nbsp; that case, plaintiff should receive&nbsp; the&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; in&nbsp; pesos, on May&nbsp; 17, 1949, of&nbsp; what the New York Agency paid to Otis Elevator, i.e. $14,467.21.&nbsp; (plus&nbsp; bank fees of course.) According to the&nbsp; minority opinion, the equivalent in pesos of the same&nbsp; amount of dollars on October 4, 1949.&nbsp; <i> No. 17%&nbsp; tax on both dates.</i>&nbsp; In&nbsp; converting dollars into pesos, no&nbsp; 17% exchange tax&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; imposable,&nbsp; since&nbsp; it was created only in March 1951.&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff knows the case, for it was a party to it; and anticipating, in this appeal, the obvious&nbsp; conclusions, it&nbsp; insists not so much on the letter of&nbsp; credit,&nbsp; as&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; bill of&nbsp; exchange&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; A<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font>.&nbsp; As stated before, such draft was drawn by Otis&nbsp; Elevator Co. in New York.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; addressed to defendant as drawee, who is due&nbsp; course accepted it.&nbsp; There is no' question that upon accepting it, defendant became&nbsp; a party primarily liable<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font>;&nbsp; and the holder&nbsp; (Philippine National Bank) may sue&nbsp; him,&nbsp; even&nbsp; if&nbsp; there&nbsp; had been&nbsp; no&nbsp; presentation for payment&nbsp; on the day&nbsp; of maturity.&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 70 Negotiable Instruments&nbsp; Law.)<br><br>Admittedly, defendant's&nbsp; responsibility&nbsp; is&nbsp; for&nbsp; $14,449.15 due&nbsp; in Manila on October 4,&nbsp; 1949 (plus bank fees).&nbsp;&nbsp; He is under obligation to deliver such amount in pesos as were the equivalent of $14,449.15. At&nbsp; what rate of&nbsp; exchange? The&nbsp; rate&nbsp; prevailing on the day of&nbsp; issuance, day&nbsp; of&nbsp; acceptance,&nbsp; day of maturity, the day&nbsp; suit is filed, or that prevailing on&nbsp; the day judgment is&nbsp; rendered requiring him to pay?&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein&nbsp; lies the center of the&nbsp; controversy. Appellant will win&nbsp; this appeal&nbsp; only&nbsp; if the rate on the last two&nbsp; days above mentioned is held to be the legal rate.<br><br>The document is negotiable and&nbsp; is&nbsp; governed by the Negotiable Instruments Law.&nbsp; But this&nbsp; statute does not contain&nbsp; any express provision on the question.&nbsp; We know the draft&nbsp; is a foreign bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; exchange, because, drawn in New York,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; payable&nbsp; here.&nbsp; (Sec. 129&nbsp; Negotiable Instruments Law.)&nbsp;&nbsp; We also know that although the amount payable is expressed in dollars-not current money here—it is still negotiable, for it may be discharged with pesos of equivalent amount<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[3]</sup></font>. The&nbsp; problem arises when we&nbsp; try to determine the&nbsp; "equivalent amount", because&nbsp; the rate of exchange&nbsp; fluctuates from day to day.<br><br>There are decisions in America&nbsp; to the effect that, "the rate&nbsp; of exchange in effect at the time the bill should have been paid" controls.&nbsp;&nbsp; (11 C.J.S. p. 264.)<br><br>Such decisions agree with the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act of&nbsp; England <font color="#FF0000"><sup>[4]&nbsp;</sup></font> and could&nbsp; be taken as enunciating the&nbsp; correct principle, inasmuch as our&nbsp; Negotiable Instruments Law,&nbsp; practically copied the American Uniform Negotiable&nbsp; Instruments&nbsp; Law which in&nbsp; turn&nbsp; was based largely on the Bills of Exchange Act of England of 1882. In fact we praetically followed this&nbsp; rule&nbsp; in Westminster Bank <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; K. Nassoor, 58 Phil. 855.<br><br>There is&nbsp; one decision applying the rate of exchange at the time judgment is entered.&nbsp; (11 C. J. S. p. 264.)<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[5]</sup></font><br><br>This&nbsp; decision however seems&nbsp; not to&nbsp; have&nbsp; taken&nbsp; into. account the Bills of Exchange Act above-mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we have rejected its view in&nbsp; the Westminster case, supra. Furthermore it related to a bill expressly made<i> payable in</i> a foreign currency-which is&nbsp; not the case here. And the theory&nbsp; would&nbsp; probably produce undesirable&nbsp; effects upon commercial documents, for it would make the amount uncertain, the parties to the bill not being able to foresee the day judgment&nbsp; would be rendered <font color="#FF0000"><sup>[6]</sup></font>.<br><br>But, the appellant argues, the defendant had promised to pay $14,419.15<i> in&nbsp; dollars;</i> therefore he must be ordered to pay the sum in dollars at current rates <i>plus 17%.</i><br><br>The argument&nbsp; rests&nbsp; on&nbsp; a wrong&nbsp; premise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant had not promised&nbsp; to pay in dollars.&nbsp; He agreed to pay <i>the equivalent</i> of 14,419.15 dollars, <i>in Philippine currency</i> <font color="#FF0000"><sup>[7]</sup></font>.<br><br>But if we admit that defendant had&nbsp; agreed to pay in dollars, then we have to apply Republic Act No.&nbsp; 529 and say that his obligation&nbsp; ''shall be discharged in Philippine currency measured at the prevailing rates of exchange at the time the obligation was incurred."<br><br>Now then, Zulueta's&nbsp; obligation having been incurred<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[8]</sup></font> before the creation of the 17%&nbsp; tax, it may not be validly burdened with such tax, because the law imposing it could not be deemed to have impaired obligations already existing at the time of its approval.<br><br>The plaintiff's theory seems to be&nbsp; that in remitting dollars to its New York Agency, after it collects&nbsp; from defendant, it has&nbsp; to pay for the said excise tax.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[9]</sup></font>&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial judge expressed the belief that&nbsp; such amount had&nbsp; been remitted before the enactment&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic Act 601, because considering&nbsp; the practice of&nbsp; banks&nbsp; of&nbsp; replenishing their agencies abroad with necessary funds,&nbsp; he deemed&nbsp; it improbable that the Manila Office of the Bank—in two years— had not&nbsp; reimbursed its&nbsp; New&nbsp; York Agency for the amount advanced on account of the draft Exhibit A.&nbsp; This belief most&nbsp; probably&nbsp; accorded with&nbsp; reality;&nbsp; because&nbsp; as&nbsp; early as May&nbsp; 17, 1949 (Exhibit G) the New&nbsp; York&nbsp; Agency had "charged" the amount of this draft against the account of the&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; office&nbsp; there,—which means&nbsp; the&nbsp; Agency had reimbursed itself the amount of the draft out of the funds of the Manila Office then in its possession (in New York) or&nbsp; coming&nbsp; to&nbsp; its&nbsp; possession&nbsp; afterwards.&nbsp; And it&nbsp; is unbelievable&nbsp; that in two&nbsp; years the Manila office never had in New&nbsp; York sufficient&nbsp; funds to effect the reimbursement.<br><br>In fact,&nbsp; the statement of account rendered by&nbsp; plaintiff to defendant on October 17, 1952, (Exhibit D) enumerated these charges:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><p>"To your acceptance amounting to ............................ </p></td> <td width="25%"><div align="right">$14,449.15</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="7%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="68%">Plus: Remitter's Commission ........................ </td> <td> <div align="right">18.06</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">___________</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Converted at 3/4 % .....................................</td> <td><div align="right">$14.567.21</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="right">P29,151.43</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>5% int. 5/17/49-10/19/52-1251 da. ...........</td> <td> <div align="right">4,995.68</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">___________</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">P34,147.11</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>10% comm. on $14,449.15 ........................... </td> <td><div align="right">2,911.51</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Documentary stamps ...................................</td> <td> <div align="right">8.70</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Air Mail ....................................................... </td> <td><div align="right">2.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>17% Excise Tax on P29,151.43 ................... </td> <td><div align="right">4,955.74</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Other charges ................................ </td> <td><div align="right">3.00"</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="right">___________</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>From the above it may be deduced that the amount of the draft had been <i>remitted </i>or paid to the&nbsp; New&nbsp; York Agency <i>in May 1949,</i> for&nbsp; the reason that Zulueta is&nbsp; charged with remitter's&nbsp; commission"&nbsp; and 5%&nbsp; interest on the amount of the draft (and such&nbsp; commission)&nbsp; <i>beginning from May 17, 1949</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This necessarily implies that&nbsp; in accordance with Exhibit G,&nbsp; the&nbsp; New York Agency&nbsp; had been&nbsp; reimbursed of the draft's amount (or such amount was remitted) on May&nbsp; 17, 1949.[10]&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; in May&nbsp; 1949&nbsp; no&nbsp; 17%&nbsp; exchange tax was payable&nbsp; upon&nbsp; such&nbsp; remittance;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila office did&nbsp; not pay it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; Zulueta should not&nbsp; pay it too.<br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the foregoing the judgment will be affirmed, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against appellant.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.

Plaintiff, therefore, could not have paid&nbsp; such tax, and not having done so it has no right to get reimbursement therefor from defendant.<br><br>I do not think that defendant could be legally made to pay&nbsp; more than what plaintiff&nbsp; had actually&nbsp; advanced for him,&nbsp; aside from commission&nbsp; and other charges,&nbsp; on the theory that the&nbsp; Philippine peso&nbsp; has depreciated in value with respect to the American dollar.&nbsp; Legally, it has not. The&nbsp; legal rate of&nbsp; exchange between the&nbsp; two currencies is&nbsp; still&nbsp; two to&nbsp; one.&nbsp; What happened is&nbsp; that with&nbsp; the creation&nbsp; of the excise tax in 1951,&nbsp; it would now be more costly to remit dollars abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp; But why should&nbsp; plaintiff make that remittance now when, as already&nbsp; stated, it must have already done so long before the creation of the excise tax on foreign exchange?<br><br>Lastly,&nbsp; a&nbsp; debtor&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; charged with bad faith for refusing&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; that which he should not pay.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><br><center> C O N C U R R I N G&nbsp; </center><br><br>FELIX,<i> J., </i><br><br>The decision rendered&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case,&nbsp; penned&nbsp; by&nbsp; Mr. Justice Cesar Bengzon,&nbsp; perfectly reflects and&nbsp; delivers the opinion of the majority&nbsp; of this Court&nbsp; and I subscribe to each&nbsp; and every&nbsp; statement made&nbsp; and&nbsp; argument&nbsp; adduced therein.&nbsp; This&nbsp; being so, it would seem that any concurring&nbsp; or&nbsp; supporting&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; is quite&nbsp; superfluous and&nbsp; I would not have taken the&nbsp; task of writing&nbsp; further in the matter were it not&nbsp; for the fact that in&nbsp; the dissenting opinion&nbsp; it is stated that:<br><blockquote> "It&nbsp; cannot be justly contended that if&nbsp; a&nbsp; debtor had&nbsp; borrowed, say $10,000, the lender&nbsp; should&nbsp; be satisfied with eight or nine thousand.&nbsp; Yet that is what the&nbsp; majority's decision actually amounts to". </blockquote>The writer further says that:<br><blockquote> "the majority&nbsp; opinion has the merit of giving the bank a&nbsp; costly lesson&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; advantages of not considering political influence in the&nbsp; making and&nbsp; collecting of its loans; but I am afraid the experience will be too&nbsp; quickly forgotten to even palliate the sacrifice ox fundamental justice to technical considerations". </blockquote>I, certainly,&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; leave these&nbsp; statements&nbsp; pass&nbsp; unanswered.<br><br>To&nbsp; begin with, I might say that if any lesson has been given&nbsp; by the majority of this Court to the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; bank, it is not&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case&nbsp; but in&nbsp; the case of Araneta<i>&nbsp; vs.</i> The Philippine&nbsp; National Bank&nbsp; (G.

No.&nbsp; L-4633, May 31, 1954), cited&nbsp; in the majority decision,&nbsp; where the&nbsp; latter was a party to that case and&nbsp; a&nbsp; similar&nbsp; doctrine was laid down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming&nbsp; now&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; bone of&nbsp; contention,&nbsp; I notice that&nbsp; the dissenting Justice views the&nbsp; matter involved in the&nbsp; controversy as&nbsp; a<i> loan</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; submits&nbsp; that the&nbsp; question&nbsp; really at issue&nbsp; can&nbsp; be boiled down to the proposition of&nbsp; "whether it is&nbsp; the&nbsp; lender or the borrower who should&nbsp; bear&nbsp; the&nbsp; added&nbsp; cost&nbsp; of the depreciation of the&nbsp; peso in relation to the dollar".<br><br>In this connection,&nbsp; I&nbsp; might&nbsp; say that defendant's&nbsp; obligation to the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp;&nbsp; would&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; settled&nbsp; some years&nbsp; ago were it not for the fact that the Bank&nbsp; insisted in&nbsp; collecting the special excise&nbsp; tax of&nbsp; 17 per&nbsp; cent&nbsp; on foreign&nbsp; exchange transactions imposed by Republic&nbsp; Act No. 601&nbsp; which&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; effect on March 28, 1951, and was not yet in force at the time the&nbsp; obligation of the defendant matured&nbsp; on October&nbsp; 4, 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; even if&nbsp; we look at the case as a&nbsp; loan and&nbsp; apply to the transaction&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of Article&nbsp; 312, paragraph 1, of the Code&nbsp; of Commerce,&nbsp; cited by the&nbsp; dissenting Justice, yet We could not, under the&nbsp; facts and circumstances of the case that cannot be denied, logically&nbsp; arrive&nbsp; at&nbsp; the same conclusion that lie has come to.<br><br>And the reason is obvious.&nbsp; In the first place, We have to&nbsp; take into account that the New York agency of Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bank and its&nbsp; central office&nbsp; in&nbsp; Manila are not&nbsp; separate and independent entities.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is&nbsp; why it is the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank&nbsp; (Manila&nbsp; office)&nbsp; and not the New York agency of said Bank that is the plaintiff&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; any&nbsp; payment made&nbsp; to plantiffs&nbsp; central&nbsp; office&nbsp; in Manila for obligations&nbsp; that any debtor&nbsp; may&nbsp; have contracted with said&nbsp; New York agency is and has to be considered as a payment or settlement of said obligations, there being&nbsp; no need to attain this result that the plaintiff would adjust is&nbsp; accounts with its&nbsp; agency, or transmit to the&nbsp; latter the amounts received from the debtor.<br><br>In&nbsp; the second place, the&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; contracted by&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; was not&nbsp; to pay $14,419.15 in&nbsp; dollars, but&nbsp; the <i>equivalent </i> of $14,419.15&nbsp; dollars,&nbsp; in <i>Philippine currency.</i> So,&nbsp; when&nbsp; defendant's obligation&nbsp; matured on&nbsp; October 4, 1949, the defendant had to pay to the&nbsp; Bank not the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; $14,467.21 representing the face&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the draft Exhibit A, plus $18.06 as&nbsp; 1/8&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1 per cent commission, <i>but its equivalent in pesos</i> at&nbsp; the time&nbsp; of such maturity, and had the defendant failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; satisfy then&nbsp; his obligation, he could be held liable to&nbsp; pay in addition thereof,&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; interests&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; default&nbsp; and nothing else.&nbsp; And that&nbsp; is&nbsp; precisely&nbsp; what&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; is willing to pay.<br><br>From the&nbsp; foregoing,&nbsp; I hope&nbsp; to have&nbsp; made clear my stand on the matter.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><center><br>D I S S E N T I N G<br></center><br><br>REYES, <i>J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L., J., </i><br><br>As, I view&nbsp; it, the question before this Court is&nbsp; whether it is the lender or&nbsp; the defaulting borrower who should bear the&nbsp; added cost of&nbsp; the&nbsp; depreciation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; peso&nbsp; in relation to the dollar.<br><br>When in 1949 the Philippine National Bank remitted&nbsp; to the Otis Elevator Co.&nbsp; the $14,449.15 for the account&nbsp; of Zulueta, the Bank, in effect, loaned, to Zulueta said amount on&nbsp; the&nbsp; strength&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; express&nbsp; engagement&nbsp; to&nbsp; "pay&nbsp; at maturity&nbsp; in&nbsp; Philippine Currency,&nbsp; <i>the equivalent of the above amount,"</i> which was a promise to pay such amount in Philippine pesos as&nbsp; could be converted into $14,449.15. There is no question that Zulueta failed to do so, and has refused to do&nbsp; so up to&nbsp; the present.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the meantime, in 1951, the Legislature&nbsp; enacted&nbsp; Rep. Act No.&nbsp; 601, imposing a 17 % special excise tax on foreign exchange trans- actions, so that thereafter one had to pay&nbsp; 234 pesos for every $100,&nbsp; instead&nbsp; of P200&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; heretofore.&nbsp; Should Zulueta be required to pay for the dollars at the new rate?<br><br>Since Zulueta's&nbsp; obligation is measured&nbsp; in&nbsp; terms of U.S. <i>dollars</i> that have increased in value vis-a-vis the peso, Art. 312, par.&nbsp; 1, of the Code of Commerce, which was the law then in force, must be read into the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; It provides:<br><blockquote>"If the loan&nbsp; consists of money, tine debtor shall pay it by returning an amount equal to that received, in accordance with the legal value which the money may have <i>at the time of the return,</i> unless the kind of money in which the payment is t.o&nbsp; be made&nbsp; has been&nbsp; stipulated, in which case&nbsp; <i>the change which its value 'may suffer shall be to&nbsp; the detriment or for the benefit&nbsp; of the lendar.</i>"&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>The majority decision,&nbsp; in upholding the contention that Zulueta&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; chargeable&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; 17%&nbsp; tax,&nbsp; virtually authorizes just the&nbsp; contrary; and permits the defaulting borrower to repay an&nbsp; amount in pesos that, in&nbsp; violation of the law&nbsp; and his engagement, can not be converted into the same amount of dollars loaned to him.&nbsp; I believe it is contrary to all elemental justice and good faith to enable a borrower to return to his creditor less than the amount borrowed, specially taking into account that&nbsp; Zulueta,&nbsp; by his obdurate refusal to pay a just debt, is&nbsp; a debtor in bad faith&nbsp; who&nbsp; is&nbsp; responsible for&nbsp; any&nbsp;&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; damages suffered by his creditor, even&nbsp; if&nbsp; due&nbsp; to fortuitous event.<br><br>Applicable&nbsp; here are&nbsp; the considerations in Hawes&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Wooicock&nbsp; (26&nbsp; Wis. 629,&nbsp; 635), quoted with approval&nbsp; in Engel <i>vs.</i> Mariano Velasco &amp;&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; 47 Phil. 115,&nbsp; 143:<br><blockquote>"In Hawes <i>vs.&nbsp; </i>Woolcock&nbsp; (26 Wis., 629, 635),&nbsp; the court said: 'Perhaps a strict application of logical reasoning to the question would lead to the result&nbsp; that the premium should he estimated at the rate when the note fell due.&nbsp; That was when the money should have been paid, and when&nbsp; the default in&nbsp; performing the contract occurred. This conclusion would be supported by the analogy derived from tile rule of damages&nbsp; on&nbsp; contracts to&nbsp; deliver specific articles, fixing the market price at the time when they ought to have been delivered as&nbsp; the&nbsp; criterion.&nbsp; This rule&nbsp; might sometimes&nbsp; be to&nbsp; the advantage of the holder&nbsp; of the&nbsp; note,&nbsp; as in the present case.&nbsp; In other cases, where the premium was less at the time the note became due than at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of&nbsp; trial, it would be to his detriment.&nbsp; And in view of these&nbsp; uncertainties and fluctuations&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; rate, upon grounds of policy as well as 'for its tendency to do&nbsp; as complete justice between the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; as is possible, we&nbsp; have come to the conclusion that <i>the true</i> rule in such cases is to give judgment for such an amount as will, <i>at the time of the judgment,</i> purchase&nbsp; the amount due on the note in the funds or&nbsp; currency in which&nbsp; it is payable' "</blockquote>The&nbsp; crucial&nbsp; point is&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bank's action is not for damages, but for&nbsp; specific&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of Zulueta's obligation.&nbsp; While payable in Philippine pesos, it was actually one to pay a&nbsp; definite&nbsp; sum in United&nbsp; States dollars,&nbsp; since he&nbsp; promised&nbsp; to pay an equivalent amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; failure to specify any&nbsp; fixed number of pesos, and&nbsp; the omission of any reference to any&nbsp; rate of exchange, is proof that the parties&nbsp; had in&nbsp; mind the&nbsp; restoration&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Bank of the value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; dollars&nbsp; it&nbsp; had&nbsp; advanced.&nbsp; In other words, Zulueta engaged to return to the Bank so many Philippine pesos&nbsp; as could&nbsp; be converted into $14,449.15; and&nbsp; that is what the Bank now asks him to do.&nbsp; It can not be justly contended that if a&nbsp; debtor had borrowed, say, ten thousand dollars, the lender&nbsp; should be&nbsp; satisfied with eight&nbsp; or&nbsp; nine thousand. Yet that is what the majority's decision actually amounts to.<br><br>I see no&nbsp; point in determining&nbsp; the rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; dollar-peso exchange at the date oi' maturity or of&nbsp; the constitution of the obligation, since Zulueta&nbsp; did&nbsp; not engage to pay&nbsp; any definite amount of pesos, but so many as would be needed to make up $14,449.15.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; as Zulueta is being required to comply with a specific promise,&nbsp; there is no relevancy in whether or not the&nbsp; main office of the Bank has or has not remitted the dollars to its American agency; after all, the two&nbsp; are part of the same institution.&nbsp; Anyway, if&nbsp; the dollars&nbsp; have not&nbsp; been&nbsp; remitted, the amount that&nbsp; Zulueta is now&nbsp; sentenced to pay will&nbsp; not&nbsp; permit a remittance of the same number of dollars that the Bank advanced for his account. If they were&nbsp; heretofore remitted,&nbsp; the funds of the Bank in Manila have been diminished<i> pro tanto,</i>&nbsp; and they&nbsp; can not be replenished to their original level <i>in terms of dollars</i> unless&nbsp; Zulueta is&nbsp; required to pay&nbsp; the exchange tax.<br><br>Of course, the majority opinion&nbsp; has the merit of giving the Bank a costly lesson on the advantages of not considering political influence in the making and collecting of its loans; but I am afraid&nbsp; the experience will be too quickly forgotten&nbsp; to even&nbsp; palliate&nbsp; the sacrifice of fundamental justice to&nbsp; technical considerations.<br><br>For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.<br><br><i>Labrador, Concepcion</i> and<i> Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
