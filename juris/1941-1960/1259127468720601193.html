				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal against an order of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Quezon in Criminal Case No. 10535, People <i>vs. </i> Alfredo Puyal, et al, dated March 30,&nbsp; 1954, denying a motion of the accused to&nbsp; lift the&nbsp; court's&nbsp; order confiscating his appeal bond, and, also against its&nbsp; order dated&nbsp; May 13,&nbsp; 1954, denying&nbsp; a motion for reconsideration of the Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc.,&nbsp; surety on the appeal bond,&nbsp; to lift the&nbsp; said&nbsp; order of&nbsp; confiscation, and if not&nbsp; possible to do so, that the surety's liability&nbsp; thereon be diminished to one-tenth of the amount of the bond.<br><br>Upon his&nbsp; conviction&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance, Puyal appealed and filed a bond in the amount of&nbsp; P10,OO0, executed by the Manila&nbsp; Surety &amp; Fidelity Co., Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The date of the appeal is March 2, 1951.&nbsp; On April 11,&nbsp; 1953, the&nbsp; Manila Surety &amp; Fidelity Co.,&nbsp; Inc. was notified that the&nbsp; promulgation of the sentence of&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Appeals was to take place on April 27, 1953.&nbsp; Upon petition of his counsel, the date of&nbsp; the promulgation&nbsp; was&nbsp; postponed&nbsp; to June 10,1953.&nbsp; Before this date, counsel asked for another extension&nbsp; of&nbsp; ten days, but this was denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon the&nbsp; court ordered the confiscation of the bond,&nbsp; the arrest of the accused, and the production of his person within 30 days, with explanation why judgment&nbsp; should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be rendered against the surety for&nbsp; the amount of the bond. A motion to reconsider this order was denied.&nbsp; So was a second motion therefor.&nbsp; On October 30, 1953, the Fiscal moved for judgment&nbsp; against the surety and the&nbsp; arrest of the accused.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion&nbsp; was granted on November 3, 1953,&nbsp; In&nbsp; a&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; order,&nbsp; the&nbsp; surety was&nbsp; given another period&nbsp; up to December 1, 1953&nbsp; to&nbsp; produce the person of the "accused. The bondsman filed&nbsp; another motion for another&nbsp; extension of time, but this was denied. The execution of the bond was again ordered,&nbsp; as wall as the arrest of the accused, as the surety failed to c6mply with the court's order.&nbsp; On March 30, 1954, the accused voluntarily appeared before the court&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reading of the sentence,&nbsp; and&nbsp; at the&nbsp; same&nbsp; time his&nbsp; counsel moved to lift the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; confiscation^ of the bond.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; alleged in the motion that his failure to contact his lawyers was&nbsp; due to his belief&nbsp; that his case was still pending appeal in the Court ot&nbsp; Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion was denied on the same day.&nbsp; On&nbsp; May 6,. 1954,&nbsp; the surety&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; have the order of confiscation reconsidered, and to reduce&nbsp; its liability on the&nbsp; bond, alleging&nbsp; that it&nbsp; had&nbsp; employed&nbsp; a&nbsp; representative in the towns where the accused was supposed to be found, but that said representative failed to locate his whereabouts;&nbsp; that it&nbsp; had&nbsp; appealed to&nbsp; the authorities for help in locating the accused, but to no&nbsp; avail; and that the surety had&nbsp; also contacted&nbsp; all its branches for help in locating the accused, but also to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp; It invoked the discretion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court, in view of the diligence it had exerted to locate the whereabouts of&nbsp; its principal and produce him in court, and&nbsp; the unbroken line of decisions to the effect that where the accused&nbsp; has already been arrested,&nbsp; the court' may&nbsp; relieve the&nbsp; surety from a part or portion of its&nbsp; liability&nbsp; according to the circumstances of each particular&nbsp; case. This&nbsp; ,was&nbsp; also denied&nbsp; in&nbsp; an order of May 13, 1954.<br><br>On this appeal,&nbsp; the cases of People <i>vs.</i> Alamada,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> G.R. No. L-2155 promulgated on May 23, 1951; and People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Arlatinco,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-3411,&nbsp; promulgated on May 30, 1951, are&nbsp; invoked.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the first case, we reduced&nbsp; the amount of the bondsman's liability from P2.000 to P200. In his brief the Solicitor General calls attention- to the fact that in the cases where We have reduced the liability of bondsmen, failure to produce the&nbsp; person of the accused was not so unreasonably&nbsp; long as in the case at bar.&nbsp; In the case of People vs. Reyes, 48 Phil. 139,&nbsp; the delay was only five days.&nbsp; In the Alamada case, the&nbsp; delay was six days.&nbsp; But in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar" the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; submitted . himself to the court only after ten months&nbsp; from the date "when the&nbsp; confiscation&nbsp; of his bail&nbsp; was&nbsp; ordered- , So&nbsp; he prays that the order be sustained and that the motion to reduce bondman's&nbsp; liability be denied.<br><br>The liberality which we have&nbsp; shown&nbsp; in dealing with bondsmen&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal cases and in mitigating their liability on bonds already confiscated because rff the delay in the&nbsp; presentation of defendants,&nbsp; finds&nbsp; explanation in the fact that the ultimate desire of the State is not the monetary&nbsp; reparation of the bondsman's&nbsp; default, but the enforcement or execution of the sentence, such as the imprisonment of. the accused&nbsp; or the payment by him of the fine&nbsp; imposed.&nbsp; That interest&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; State&nbsp; can&nbsp; not be measured&nbsp; in terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; as&nbsp; in&nbsp; private contracts and obligations.&nbsp; The&nbsp; surrender of the&nbsp; person of the accused so&nbsp; that he can serve his sentence is&nbsp; its&nbsp; ultimate goal or object.&nbsp; The&nbsp; provisioni for the confiscation of the bond, upon&nbsp; failure&nbsp; within a reasonable&nbsp; time to&nbsp; produce the person of the accused&nbsp; for&nbsp; the execution of the sentence, is not&nbsp; based upon a desire to gain from such failure; it is to compel the bondsman to enchance its&nbsp; efforts to have the person of the accused produced for&nbsp; the execution of the sentence.&nbsp; Hence after the surety&nbsp; has presented the person of the accused to the court,&nbsp; or the accused already arrested, we have&nbsp; invariably&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; our&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; in favor of the partial remission of the bondsman's liability.<br><br>A further reason for such liberality lies in the fact that if&nbsp; the courts were&nbsp; strict&nbsp; in&nbsp; enforcing&nbsp; the liability&nbsp; of bondsmen,&nbsp; the latter would&nbsp;&nbsp; demand&nbsp; higher&nbsp; rates&nbsp; for furpishing&nbsp; bail for&nbsp; accused persons,&nbsp; making it difficult for such, accused to secure their freedom during the course of the proceedings.&nbsp; If courts&nbsp; were strict&nbsp; in- the enforcement&nbsp; of the monetary responsibility&nbsp; of bondsman, bail, which is considered a precious&nbsp; right,&nbsp; would be difficult to&nbsp; obtain.&nbsp; Bondsmen will&nbsp; reduce rates only if the, courts are liberal&nbsp; in dealing with them in the performance of their obligations.<br><br>Lastly, if the courts are&nbsp; averse to mitigating the monetary responsibility of bondsmen after confiscation of their bond, bondsmen would be indifferent towards the attempts of the State to secure the arrest of defendants, instead of helping it therein.<br><br>But while we are&nbsp; committed&nbsp; to a&nbsp; policy&nbsp; of&nbsp; liberality towards&nbsp; bondsmen, the circumstances of each case must determine the'degree&nbsp; in which&nbsp; said liberality should&nbsp; be exercised.&nbsp; Diligence on the part of the bondsmen&nbsp; in the performance of their obligation must, be the gauge for such&nbsp; liberality.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case&nbsp; at bar,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; fully satisfied with the explanation given why the presentation ' of the person of the accused was delayed for a&nbsp; period of 10&nbsp; months.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand, the bond .confiscated (P10,000)&nbsp; is not proportional to&nbsp; the sentence,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is 5 years, 5 months and&nbsp; 11 days of&nbsp;<i> prision&nbsp; correctional.</i> We believe that the ends of justice will best be subserved if we reduce, as we hereby&nbsp; reduce, the&nbsp; liability of the bondsman,&nbsp; Manila Surety and&nbsp; Fidelity Co., Inc.,&nbsp; from P10,000 as ordered by the&nbsp; trial court, to P3,000.&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><i>Pan√°s, C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista, Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
