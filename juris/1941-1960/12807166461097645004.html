				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court of First Instance of Samar, DELFIN TORRECAMPO and
 ALFREDO MENDEZ were jointly charged with murder for the killing of 
IGNACIO BALLONICO.  After trial, Alfredo Mendez was acquitted for 
insufficiency of evidence.  His co-defendant Delfin Torrecampo was found
 guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with the 
accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the 
sum of P2,000.00, and to pay 1/2 of the costs.  Torrecampo is appealing 
from that decision.  The amended information on which the defendants 
were tried reads as follows: 
  <blockquote>"That on or about the 9th day of March, 1950, at Bo. 
Makiwalo, municipality of Mondragon, province of Samar, Philippines, and
 within the jurisdiction of this Hon. Court, the above-named accused 
with intent to kill, and with evident premeditation and treachery, 
conspiring together and confederating and helping one another did then 
and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and wound
 one Ignacio Ballonico, with a knife which the accused Delfin Torrecampo
 had conveniently provided himself for the purpose while accused Alfredo
 Mendez was poised and in the act of preventing the said victim from 
offering resistance, thereby inflicting one mortal wound upon the person
 of said Ignacio Ballonico at the lower right abdominal cavity which 
wound caused his instantaneous death."</blockquote>

  <p>The trial court found Torrecampo guilty as charged, but as already 
stated, sentenced him only to life imprisonment which is the medium of 
the penalty prescribed for the crime of murder despite the allegation of
 the aggravating circumstance of either treachery or premeditation.</p>
  <p> The following facts have been duly established.  In the evening of
 March 8, 1950, Federico de Guia entertained friends in his house on the
 occasion of the <i>novena</i> held there in connection with the death 
of his mother.  Drinking tuba was indulged in by the visitors and in the
 course thereof, there ensued a quarrel which degenerated into a fight 
between Delfin Torrecampo and Ignacio Ballonico, resulting in the latter
 boxing the former and striking him on the back with a piece of wood.  
Torrecampo presumably to avoid further punishment because Ballonico was 
bigger and taller than himself, jumped out of the window but from below 
he warned his assailant to beware for someday he was goint to kill him.</p>
  <p>The following afternoon Ballonico accompanied by his wife Consorcia
 repaired to the house of Manuel de Guia for the purpose of buying a 
carabao to be slaughtered in connection with the <i>novenario</i> in the
 house of Federico de Guia.  After ascertaining the price of the carabao
 which Manuel said was available for sale, and as the couple was about 
to return home, Torrecampo suddenly approached Ballonico from behind and
 as the latter turned around, struck him in the right lower part of the 
abdomen with a knife, inflicting a mortal wound which the President of 
the Sanitary Division described as - </p>
  <blockquote>"Wound, stab, rt. iliac region, 2" long x 3/4" wide.  
Evisceration (of intestines, small) w/ gangrene.  Wound, punctured, (S) 
intestines, small, w/ peritonitis Hemorrage, acute, secondary.  Shock."</blockquote>

  <p>and from which Ballonico died the following day.</p>
  <p> There is no doubt as to the infliction of the mortal wound by 
appellant Torrecampo.  He does not deny it.  He, however, claims that he
 acted in self-defense.  As to the alleged participation of Alfredo 
Mendez, the court found that he was not present on the occasion of the 
stabbing, much less participated in it.  The theory of appellant 
Torrecampo is that when on the afternoon of March 9th, he approached the
 house of Manuel de Guia, he found Ballonico and his wife in the yard 
talking to De Guia who was at the window of his house; that Consorcia 
began to reproach him, accusing him of spreading the rumor that he was 
engaged to her sister LUCERING; that when he denied the charge, she 
began assaulting him inflicting blows on his face, and that her husband 
Ballonico immediately joined in the assault, striking him with a piece 
of bamboo on the back with such force that the bamboo broke; that he 
(Torrecampo) stepped forward to avoid other blows and when he turned 
around he saw Ballonico with a knife in his hand which knife Ballonico 
actually swung at him, and that to defend himself he brought but his own
 knife and stabbed Ballonico in the abdomen.</p>
  <p>After a careful study of the evidence, we agree with the trial 
court in its rejection of the story of Torrecampo.  We find that 
appellant approached Ballonico from behind and as the latter turned 
around to go home unaware of the presence of the appellant, the latter 
suddenly stabbed him in the abdomen.  There is evidence to the effect 
that though caught unawares Ballonico instinctively stepped aside to 
avoid the aggression; but his attempt at escape was blocked by Alfredo 
Mendez.  It is also said that immediately before the assault, Alfredo 
Mendez was heard to say: "If you want fight, fight; if hit, hit".  
However, the trial court as already said acquitted Mendez on 
insufficiency of evidence.</p>
  <p> The killing was qualified by treachery thus raising it to the 
category of murder.  Although the information alleges the aggravating 
circumstance of premeditation, as pointed out by the Solicitor General, 
there is no valid ground for holding that it attended the commission of 
the crime.  The grudge engendered by the fight between Torrecampo and 
Ballonico in the house of Federico de Guia the night before, in which 
Torrecampo was at the losing end, may well and logically be considered 
as the motive behind the killing.  But although he warned Ballonico that
 he would someday kill him, there is no evidence that he really meant to
 kill the deceased, and that from that moment he planned and reflected 
on killing his assailant, and in pursuance of said plan he followed the 
deceased to the yard of Manuel de Guia the following day.  For all we 
know, it may well have been a chance meeting but that when he saw the 
deceased that afternoon his resentment of the previous evening flared 
anew and he decided right then and there to attack his victim.</p>
  <p>We agree with the Solicitor General that the mitigating 
circumstance of voluntary surrender should be accorded appellant.  It 
was proved that the following day he surrendered himself to a policeman 
in the town of Mondragon.  The penalty corresponding to the crime of 
murder should therefore, be imposed in its minimum degree, namely, <i>reclusion
 temporal</i> in its maximum degree.  Applying the law on indeterminate 
sentence, the penalty should be not less than twelve (12) years of <i>prison
 mayor</i> and not more than seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and 
one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal.</i> The indemnity should also be 
increased to P6,000.00.  With these modifications, the decision appealed
 from is hereby affirmed, with costs. </p>
