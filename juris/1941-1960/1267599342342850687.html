				G.R. No. L-2855, July 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>BORIS MEJOFF, PETITIONER, VS. DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The petitioner Boris Mejoff is an alien of Russian descent who 
was brought to this country from Shanghai as a secret operative by the Japanese 
forces during the latter's regime in these Islands. Upon liberation he was 
arrested as a Japanese spy, by U. S. Army Counter Intelligence Corps. Later he 
was handed to the Commonwealth Government for disposition in accordance with 
Commonwealth Act No. 682. Thereafter the People's Court ordered his release. But 
the Deportation Board taking his case up, found that having no travel documents 
Mejoff was illegally in this country, and consequently referred the matter to 
the immigration authorities. After the corresponding investigation, the Board of 
Commissioners of Immigration on April 5, 1948, declared that Mejoff had entered 
the Philippines illegally in 1944, without inspection and admission by the 
immigration officials at a designated port of entry and, therefore, it ordered 
that he be deported on the first available transportation to Russia. The 
petitioner was then under custody, he having been arrested on March 18, 1948. In 
May, 1948 he was transferred to the Cebu Provincial Jail together with three 
other Russians to await the arrival of some Russian vessels. In July and August 
of that year two boats of Russian nationality called at the Cebu Port. But their 
masters refused to take petitioner and his companions alleging lack of authority 
to do so. In October, 1948 after repeated failures to ship this deportee abroad, 
the authorities removed him to Bilibid Prison at Muntinglupa where he has been 
confined up to the present time, inasmuch as the Commissioner of Immigration 
believes it is for the best interests of the country to keep him under detention 
while arrangements for his deportation are being made.
<p align="justify">It is contended on behalf of petitioner that having been 
brought to the Philippines <i>legally</i> by the Japanese forces, he may not now 
be deported. It is enough to say that the argument would deny to this Government 
the power and the authority to eject from the Islands any and all of the members 
of the Nipponese Army of occupation who may still be found hiding in remote 
places. Which is absurd.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner likewise contends that he may not be deported, 
because the statutory period to do that under the laws has long expired. The 
proposition has no basis. Under section 37 of the Philippine Immigration Act of 
1940 any alien who enters this country "without inspection and admission by the 
immigration authorities at a designated port of entry" is subject to deportation 
within five years.</p>
<p align="justify">In a recent decision of a similar litigation (Borovsky vs. 
Commissioner of Immigration) we denied the request for habeas corpus, 
saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It must be admitted that temporary detention is a necessary 
step in the process of exclusion or expulsion of undesirable aliens and that 
pending arrangements for his deportation, the Government has the right to hold 
the undesirable alien under confinement for a reasonable length of time. 
However, under established precedents, too long a detention may justify the 
issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">"The meaning of 'reasonable time' depends upon the 
circumstances, specially the difficulties of obtaining a passport, the 
availability of transportation, the diplomatic arrangements with the governments 
concerned and the efforts displayed to send the deportee away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Considering that this Government desires 
to expel the alien, and does not relish keeping him at the people's expense, we 
must presume it is making efforts to carry out the decree of exclusion by the 
highest officer of the land. On top of this presumption assurances were made 
during the oral argument that the Government is really trying to expedite the 
expulsion of this petitioner. On the other hand, the record fails to show how 
long he has been under confinement since the last time he was apprehended. 
Neither does he indicate neglected opportunities to send him abroad. And unless 
it is shown that the deportee is being indefinitely imprisoned under the 
pretense of awaiting a chance for deportation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> or unless the Government admits that it 
can not deport him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> or unless the 
detainee is being held for too long a period our courts will not interfere.</p>
<p align="justify">"In the United States there were at least two instances in 
which courts fixed a time limit within which the imprisoned aliens should be 
deported<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> otherwise their release would 
be ordered by writ of habeas corpus. Nevertheless, supposing such precedents 
apply in this jurisdiction, still we have no sufficient data fairly to fix a 
definite deadline."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The difference between this and the Borovsky case lies in the 
fact that the record shows this petitioner has been detained since March, 1948. 
However, considering that in the United States (where transportation facilities 
are much greater and diplomatic arrangements are easier to make) a delay of 
twenty months in carrying out an order of deportation has not been held 
sufficient to justify the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> this petition must be, and it is hereby 
denied. So ordered.</p>

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>PERFECTO, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">To continue keeping petitioner under confinement is a thing 
that shocks conscience. Under the circumstances, petitioner is entitled to be 
released from confinement. He has not been convicted for any offense for which 
he may be imprisoned. Government's inability to deport him is no pretext to keep 
him imprisoned for an indefinite length of time. The constitutional guarantee 
that no person shall be deprived of liberty without due process of law has been 
intended to protect all inhabitants or residents who may happen to be under the 
shadows of the Philippine flag.</p>
<p align="justify">Our vote is the same as the one we cast when the case of 
Borovsky vs. Commissioner of Immigration, L-2852, was submitted for decision 
although, for some misunderstanding, our vote was overlooked at the time the 
decision was promulgated. Our vote is to grant the petition and to order the 
immediate release of petitioner, without prejudice for the government to deport 
him as soon as the government could have the means to do so. In the meantime, 
petitioner is entitled to live a normal life in a peaceful country, ruled by the 
principles of law and justice.</p>
