				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari </i>seeking to set&nbsp; aside the order entered by respondent&nbsp; judge on September 15, 1955 denying petitioner's&nbsp; motion for reconsideration of a previous&nbsp; order&nbsp; of said judge and sustaining in effect the order of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; issued on February 12,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1955 holding that&nbsp; the Cassava&nbsp; Flour Law&nbsp;&nbsp; (Republic Act&nbsp; 657) was valid and constitutional until otherwise declared by a competent&nbsp;&nbsp; court. <br><br>Petitioner is a&nbsp; corporation engaged in the&nbsp; business of wheat&nbsp; flour importation since 1948 and as such is&nbsp; entitled to a regular allocation&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Central Bank of foreign exchange for the Importation of said commodity.&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 29, 1954, petitioner filed a petition for&nbsp; prohibition with preliminary Injunction in the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila&nbsp; (Civil Case No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 24975) against&nbsp; the Price Stabilization Corporation&nbsp; (PRISCO),&nbsp;&nbsp; Central Bank of the Philippines,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Administrator&nbsp; of Economic Coordination, and the&nbsp; Board of Food Inspection of&nbsp; the Department&nbsp; of Health,&nbsp;&nbsp; to prohibit them from enforcing and implementing Republic Act&nbsp; 657,&nbsp; otherwise known as&nbsp;&nbsp; the Cassava Flour law, as implemented by Executive Order No.&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; series of &nbsp;&nbsp; 1954 of&nbsp; the President of&nbsp; the Philippines, Administrative Decision No. 261 of the Board of&nbsp; Food Inspection of&nbsp;&nbsp; the Department of Health,&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Order No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 918 of the PRISCO and Memorandum to Authorized Agent&nbsp; Banks No.&nbsp; 131 of the Central Bank of&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basis of the petition is the claim that the Cassava Flour Law is oppressive),&nbsp;&nbsp; defective and unconstitutional and its&nbsp; enforcement would work grave injustice and irreparable Injury to petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The court,&nbsp; then presided over by Judge Francisco E.&nbsp; Jose,&nbsp;&nbsp; gave due course to the petition,&nbsp; to which respondents&nbsp; filed their answer in due&nbsp;&nbsp; time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The application for injunction, was set for hearing and&nbsp;&nbsp; thereafter,'the&nbsp; court issued an order on February 12,&nbsp; 1955 denying the same and holding that&nbsp; the law was valid and constitutional&nbsp; until otherwise declared by a competent&nbsp; court.<br><br>On June 17,&nbsp; 1955, Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1345 was approved abolishing&nbsp; the PRISCO and creating in Its&nbsp; place&nbsp; the National Marketing Corporation, otherwise known as&nbsp; NAMARCO.&nbsp; Alleging, that under the new law&nbsp;&nbsp; (Republic Act No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1345),&nbsp;&nbsp; the NAMARCO did not assume the power and duty of implementing the Cassava Flour Law,&nbsp; fox&nbsp; said power and duty which were expressly granted to&nbsp; the PRISCO were excluded from the law&nbsp; creating the&nbsp; NAMARCO,&nbsp; and therefore, it would be an&nbsp; <u>ultra vires</u> act for&nbsp; the NAMARCO to continue discharging the duty&nbsp; and function of implementing the Cassava&nbsp; Flour Law,&nbsp; petitioner filed on August 16,&nbsp; 1955 an amended petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amended petition alleges&nbsp; that,&nbsp; assuming the validity and constitutionality of the Cassava Flour law,&nbsp; the NAMARCO is powerless to implement it&nbsp; because the new law does not&nbsp; create an, agency for its implementation.<br><br>In the meantime, Judge Francisco Jose went on leave, and Judge Gregorio S. Narvasa who took over deferred&nbsp; action on the amended petition until&nbsp; the return of&nbsp; Judge Jose, but upon urgent&nbsp; request&nbsp; of petitioner which moved for a&nbsp; reconsideration of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; order postponing action on the amended petition, which .was&nbsp; vigorously objected&nbsp; to&nbsp; by respondents,&nbsp; Judge Narvasa set&nbsp; the incident for hearing after which&nbsp; he issued, an order on September 15, 1955 stating tersely: "Respondents'&nbsp;&nbsp; opposition to petitioner's motion for reconsideration, being well-taken,&nbsp;&nbsp; is sustained,&nbsp; and t,be motion referred to denied."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; order .now subject of&nbsp; the present petition for <i>certiorari.</i><br><br>This&nbsp; petition in effect raises&nbsp; the issue that Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1345,&nbsp; which abolishes&nbsp; the FRISCO as an agency charged with&nbsp; the power and duty to&nbsp; implement&nbsp; the Cassava Flour&nbsp; Law and&nbsp; creates&nbsp; in its&nbsp;&nbsp; place the NAMARCO,&nbsp;&nbsp; does&nbsp; not vest&nbsp; in&nbsp; the NAMARCO the&nbsp; same power and duty&nbsp; of implementation with&nbsp; the result, that,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; the law now stands,&nbsp;&nbsp; there&nbsp; no government&nbsp; agency charged with the power and duty of implementing the Cassava&nbsp; Flour Law.<br><br>This claim has no merit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place,&nbsp; the legislative intent behind Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1345&nbsp; is merely to replace&nbsp; the PRISCO,&nbsp; a purely public service corporation, with the NAMARCO, a government subsidized public corporation, which is&nbsp; exempt from the payment of taxes to better assure the promotion of greater participation of&nbsp;&nbsp; Filipino businessmen in the marketing business of our economy,&nbsp; stabilizing prices of&nbsp; commodities&nbsp; and assisting&nbsp;&nbsp; Filipino producers&nbsp; in the&nbsp; commodity support program&nbsp; all of which were the&nbsp; same objectives&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the defunct PRISCO&nbsp; (Annex 1).&nbsp; In the second&nbsp; place,&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 18,&nbsp; paragraph (b), No. 1, of&nbsp; said Act expressly provides that;&nbsp; "Any reference to&nbsp; the&nbsp; PRISCO&nbsp; in any&nbsp; existing law,&nbsp;&nbsp; or in any&nbsp; executive order,&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; or proclamation, of&nbsp;&nbsp; the resident&nbsp; shall,&nbsp; with&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to any duty or function assumed by the NAMARCO&nbsp; created&nbsp; in this&nbsp; Act,&nbsp;&nbsp; be deemed hereafter to have&nbsp; reference to the National Marketing Corporation (NAMARCO)."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And,&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the third&nbsp; place,&nbsp;&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; transfer of&nbsp; functions&nbsp; from PRISCO&nbsp; to NAMARCO&nbsp;&nbsp; can be&nbsp;&nbsp; clearly' implied from several provisions&nbsp; of said Act which,&nbsp;&nbsp; for ready&nbsp; reference, we quote hereunder: <br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. Declaration of Policy. - It is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress <u>to assist Filipino retailers and businessmen</u> by supplying them with merchantable goods at prices that will enable them to compete successfully in the open market so <u>that they may greater participation system of our economy</u>.
