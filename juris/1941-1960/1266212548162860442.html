				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment of ouster rendered by the 
Court of First Instance of Manila in an ejectment case originating from the 
municipal court which also decided in favor of the plaintiffs.
<p>The complaint is signed by plaintiffs' attorney under an oath couched in the 
following usual form: "Subscribed and sworn to before me on this 23d day of 
June, 1945 affiant with residence certificate No. 0788120 issued at Manila on 
June 12, 1945."</p>
<p>Under the first assignment of error, the defendant contends that the 
complaint is fatally defective because it is not verified in the sense indicated 
in section 6 of Rule of Court No. 15, which provides that "a pleading is 
verified by an affidavit stating that the person verifying has read the pleading 
and that the allegations thereof are true of his own knowledge." There is, in 
our opinion, substantial conformance to the rule. By signing the complaint 
himself, plaintiffs' attorney had certified that "he has read the pleading; that 
to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief there is good ground to 
support it; and that it is not interposed for delay." (Rule of Court No. 15, 
section 5.) Section 6 is applicable where the person verifying is other than the 
attorney that signs the pleading. Neither can it be said that plaintiffs' 
attorney had not sworn to the truth of the allegations of the complaint "of his 
own knowledge," because, first, there is nothing in said allegations (which are 
in positive terms and under oath) tending to show that they are based merely on 
information and, secondly, even under the implied certification arising from the 
signing of the complaint by the attorney, we cannot assume that he did not have 
personal knowledge, since said certification is to the effect that to the best 
of his knowledge and belief—not solely information—there was good ground to 
support the complaint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"En el juramento arriba transcrito no hallamos nada que apoye la conclusion 
de que Lim Yok Su no tenia conocimiento personal de los hechos sobre que juraba; 
por el contrario, en el tercer parrafo del juramento se afirma, positivamente, 
'that the defendant is about to dispose of his properties for the purpose of 
defrauding the plaintiff and other creditors. * * * That the statements 
contained in the foregoing complaint are true and correct to the best of <i>my 
knowledge</i> and belief.' Notese bien 'to the best of <i>my knowledge</i> and 
belief.' No dice 'to the best of my information.' Entendemos, pues, que, tal 
como esta redactado el juramento, la conclusion a que llego el Tribunal de 
origen, de que la declaracion jurada del gerente de la corporacion demandante no 
indicaba conocimiento personal suyo de los hechos sobre que presto el juramento, 
es erronea." (Lim Bonfiing y Hermanos, Inc. <i>vs</i>. Rodriguez, 72 Phil., 586, 
588.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 5 of Rule of Court No. 15 of course provides a safeguard against sham 
and false pleadings signed by attorneys, as it expressly authorizes as well 
elimination of any pleading intended to defeat the purpose of said rule as the 
imposition of appropriate disciplinary penalty upon the erring attorney who 
knows that his implied certification is not true.</p>
<p>Under the second assignment of error, it is argued that the plaintiffs do not 
need the premises in question (No. 1933 M. Natividad, Manila), for their own 
use, and that this suit for ejectment was brought in view of defendant's refusal 
to pay an increased rental. These defenses were overruled below, and the record 
does not exhibit any sufficient ground for the reversal of the appealed 
judgment. It is true that the plaintiffs own other <i>accesorias</i>, but this 
fact cannot be utilized by the defendant as a defense since, as aptly stated by 
Mr. Justice Padilla in De Licauco <i>vs</i>. Reyes Estaniel (G. R. No. L-215, 
decided on February 28, 1947), "the tenants of other leased houses may also set 
up the same defense, and if it be deemed sufficient to defeat the lessor's right 
to recover possession of the leased premises, the result would be a complete 
nullification of said right." Commonwealth Act No. 689 enacted on October 15, 
1945, as amended by Republic Act No. 66, cannot be invoked by the defendant, 
because the said Act, if applicable, expressly excepts cases in which the 
premises are needed by the lessors as in the case at bar.</p>
<p>Defendant's memorandum contains an intimation that the plaintiffs, after the 
rendition of the appealed judgment, had rebuilt their house which was burned. We 
cannot take the point into account, since it was not timely made the subject of 
proof. Moreover, it is met by a denial under oath made in plaintiffs' 
memorandum.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment is affirmed, with costs against the defendant. So 
ordered.</p><i>Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Padilla,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
