				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal&nbsp; from the ruling of the Auditor-General refusing to credit&nbsp; Ignacio&nbsp; E.&nbsp; Recio, as employee of the Fiber Inspection&nbsp; Service,&nbsp; with the vacation leave&nbsp; he had earned while on the staff of the University of the Philippines.<br><br>It appears that Recio&nbsp; served in&nbsp; such University from August 1932 to&nbsp; February 28,&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; (excluding the&nbsp; war years); that on the last mentioned date he resigned, without actually enjoying five (5) months of accrued vacation leave; that&nbsp; the next day, March 1, 1946,&nbsp; he entered&nbsp; the service of the United States Veterans Administration, Manila Office, from which he was laid&nbsp; off on&nbsp; April 25, 1950; that in January&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; he was&nbsp; appointed to the&nbsp; Import Control Commission; that thereafter, the Fiber Inspection Service took him&nbsp; in; and&nbsp; that later, while working in this Service, he&nbsp; requested&nbsp; in April 1957, from&nbsp; the Civil Service&nbsp; Commissioner the transfer&nbsp; to his credit in the Fiber Inspection of the 5-month vacation&nbsp; leave he had accumulated&nbsp; in the University.<br><br>At first, the&nbsp; Civil Service found against the transfer, holding that upon resignation from the University of the Philippines, Recio had forfeited all his vacation leave, pursuant to sec.&nbsp; 286 of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, upon being informed that Recio had&nbsp; resigned ior the purpose of joining the Veterans Administration, the Civil Service revised its stand, reflecting that as&nbsp; service in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Veterans Administration at that time (February 1946) could be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; service in the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Government Recio&nbsp; had not&nbsp; yet forfeited his&nbsp; vacation leave,&nbsp; because when&nbsp; he resigned from the University of the <i>Philippines, he did not leave the service</i> of the Philippine Government, and&nbsp; sec. 286 did not apply.<br><br>The University of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; objected, citing its rules in force in March 1946, to the effect that "upon separation from the University of any officer or employee, any accumulated vacation and&nbsp; sick leave to his credit shall be forfeited."<br><br>And the Auditor-General decided that the vacation and sick leave earned by Recio while serving in the U. P.&nbsp; were deemed forfeited&nbsp; upon his separation therefrom&nbsp; on&nbsp; February 28, 1946.&nbsp; He quoted sec. 286, Administrative&nbsp; Code as amended, before&nbsp; its amendment by Republic Act 611 in May, 1951.<br><br>Both&nbsp; the Civil Service and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Auditor-General&nbsp; consider sec.&nbsp; 286 as&nbsp; amended (before&nbsp; Republic Act 611) to be the governing&nbsp; statute.&nbsp; Their views&nbsp; differ,&nbsp; however: whereas the former holds that&nbsp; Recio did not&nbsp; leave the service on February 28, 1946, because the next day March 1, 1946, he joined another office of the Philippine Government, the Auditor-General&nbsp; says&nbsp; that&nbsp; Recio&nbsp; was&nbsp; on&nbsp; February 28,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1946, "separated" from the&nbsp; service within the meaning of section&nbsp; 286.<br><br>It may be&nbsp; conceded, for the moment, that&nbsp; Recio was not separated from the service on February 28, 1946, because&nbsp; the next&nbsp; day he went to&nbsp; work&nbsp; in&nbsp; the U.S.&nbsp; Veterans Administration&nbsp; (U.S.), regarded during the Commonwealth as a local office.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it cannot&nbsp; be denied fchat on July 4, 1946, (Independence Day) service in the Veterans Administration ceased to be service to the Philippine Government;&nbsp; neither&nbsp; can&nbsp; it be denied that on April 25,&nbsp; 1950, he was&nbsp; <i>dropped from the payroll</i> of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Veterans Administration.<br><br>So, it must be&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; Recio quit public employment either on July 4,1946,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or on April 25, 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; On either of these two dates,&nbsp; his separation from&nbsp; the service occurred,&nbsp; and his vacation leave was deemed forfeited under the law (section 286)&nbsp; at that time.&nbsp; It must be remembered that after&nbsp; April 25,&nbsp; 1950, he&nbsp; did&nbsp; no Government work for two years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Civil Service&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; consider Recio's separation on&nbsp; July 4, 1946,&nbsp; as&nbsp; separation "from the service" because such separation&nbsp; "was through no fault of his own."&nbsp; Herein lies the error.&nbsp; Under section 286&nbsp; as&nbsp; it stood then, whenever&nbsp; an employee leaves or is dropped from the service&nbsp; of the Philippine Government, there is separation&nbsp; from&nbsp; the service and&nbsp; forfeiture irrespective of the cause.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Solicitor-General himself who sides with the Civil Service says this:<br><blockquote>"Separation from the&nbsp; service may&nbsp; be, and is&nbsp; generally, due to resignation of&nbsp; the public official&nbsp; or&nbsp; employee concerned (Cf. Sections 21,&nbsp; 26 and 27,&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 180); or to&nbsp; abolition of the office.&nbsp; (Cf. Zandueta <i>vs.</i> die la Costa,&nbsp; 66 Phil. 615; Erana <i>vs.</i> Vergel <le dios,="" g.="" r.="" no.="" l-4495,="" prom. ="" june="" 16,="" 1951;="" antiquera=""><i>vs.</i> Baluyot,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-3318, prom. May 5, 1952; Manalang <i>vs.</i> Quitoriano, G. R. No.&nbsp; L-6898,&nbsp; prom.&nbsp; April&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1954);&nbsp; or to&nbsp; retirement (Cf. Nacionalista Party <i>vs.</i> Bautista, G. R. No. L-3452, prom. December 7, 1949)."</le><br></blockquote>The above separations involve no fault of the employee; and yet they cause forfeiture of the vacation leave, as said official impliedly admits.<br><br>In&nbsp; this&nbsp; connection, we observe&nbsp; that the office of the Solicitor-General&nbsp; agrees&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Civil Service&nbsp; for the reason that (<i>a</i>) on February 28, 1946, Recio did not leave the service; and&nbsp; (<i>b</i>) he never in fact left the service. The second proposition is evidently untenable&nbsp; for&nbsp; as&nbsp; we say, Recio&nbsp; must be&nbsp; deemed to have left the&nbsp; Philippine Government's&nbsp; service either&nbsp; on July 4, 1946&nbsp; (upon&nbsp; independence, service in the U.S. Veterans Administration could no&nbsp; longer&nbsp; be considered service in the Philippine&nbsp; Government) or on April 1950 when he returned to private life, having" been dropped from the&nbsp; Veterans&nbsp; Administration. True,&nbsp; two years later he joined the Government&nbsp; anew; but the interval broke the continuity of his service even as&nbsp; it operated to forfeit&nbsp; his leave.<br><br>Officers&nbsp; who have been long enough in the Government know the&nbsp; reasons<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> behind this forfeiture,&nbsp; which has been applied up to&nbsp; 1951.&nbsp; Events apparently&nbsp; showed its&nbsp; inequity in some cases; so&nbsp; Republic Act 611 decreed that it will not be forfeited&nbsp; <i>if&nbsp; the&nbsp; employee voluntarily resigns or&nbsp; is separated from the service through&nbsp; no fault of&nbsp; his own.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; This liberal provision we cannot apply to&nbsp; Recio, because his separation occurred before Republic&nbsp; Act 611, which has no retroactive operation.<br><br>This makes it unnecessary to discuss whether the rules of&nbsp; the University, and not section 286 as amended, control the issue.&nbsp; We have not gone into the matter, but it might be&nbsp; that leaves of absence of University employees depend exclusively upon its rules adopted pursuant to its charter. Needless to say, if the University rule hereinabove&nbsp; quoted&nbsp; applies, Recio has no right, because he lost his leave <i>upon leaving&nbsp; the&nbsp; University.</i><br><br>Wherefore, the appealed decision of the Auditor-General is affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcio</i>n, and <i>Endencia,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 286 as amended: "Sec. 286. When vacation leave and sick leave may be&nbsp; taken.— Vacation leave and sick leave shall be cummulative and any part thereof which may not be taken within the calendar year in which earned may be carried over to the&nbsp; succeeding years, but upon separation&nbsp; from the service of any officer or employee, any accumulated vacation or sick leave to his credit shall be forfeited. * * *."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Civil Service believes he was thus separated.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>One was to force the employee actually to take his leave, to improve his health <i>during his employment</i> and perform better work. Not to reserve it as a sort of savings to be enjoyed <i>after</i> he leaves Government service.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it had to be taken every year; otherwise, it was lost.&nbsp; See section 286 Administrative Code.</div>
