				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On January 8, 1943, plaintiff Nicasio Sanchez, now one of the respondents filed with the Minicipal Court of Manila a complaint against defendant Mateo&nbsp; Maddammu, now petitioner,&nbsp; alleging, among others, "that on&nbsp; or before December 5 1942? plaintiff bought from&nbsp; Alejandro Calipayan and Maura Manalo a&nbsp; house"; that "before plaintiff could take possession of and occupy said house, defendant surreptitiously and&nbsp; maliciously occupied same without the knowledge and consent of plaintiff"; and, after demanding payment of rents and attorney's fees, he prayed for either of the following reliefs:<br><blockquote>"(a) Defendant to deliver to plaintiff the possession of the house, with plaintiff promising to pay the reasonable rent for the use of the lots; or,<br><br>"(b)&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; permits plaintiff to remove the house&nbsp; from defendant's&nbsp; lot, with&nbsp; plaintiff paying&nbsp; for any undue damage which&nbsp; may be caused&nbsp; to said lot;&nbsp; or,<br><br>"(c)&nbsp; Defendant pays plaintiff the reasonable value of. the house in the amount of P150." </blockquote>After&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; respondent Court&nbsp; rendered judgment declaring that "by virtue of the sales contract, Exhibit A,&nbsp; between&nbsp; Alejandro&nbsp; Calipayan&nbsp; and Nicasio&nbsp; Sanchez the latter became the owner of the house formerly&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to Alejandro&nbsp; Calipayan'; and that&nbsp; "by virtue of his ownership, Nicasio Sanchez has the right to the possession of said house at the time the sale was&nbsp; consummated."&nbsp; The Court accordingly ordered the defendant to vacate the house;&nbsp; to give plaintiff freedom to remove it from defendant's&nbsp; lot;&nbsp; and to pay plaintiff the consequential damage of P12 per month from December 5, 1942. Plaintiff sued a writ of immediate execution of this judgment which defendant opposed and upon the allowance of the writ, defendant instituted with this Court the present certiorari&nbsp; proceeding.<br><br>Plaintiff's complaint in the respondent Court purport to be one for forcible entry, but the facts alleged&nbsp; therein fail show that such is the nature of the action.&nbsp; In forcible entry cases, the only&nbsp; issue is physical possession or possession <i>de facto</i> of a real property.&nbsp; To confer jurisdiction upon the respondent Court, the complaint should have alleged prior physical possession of the house by&nbsp; plaintiff or by his vendors and deprivation of such possession by defendant through any of the means specified by the Rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rule 72, sec. 1).&nbsp; Had plaintiff&nbsp; alleged that defendant unlawfully turned him out&nbsp; of possession of the property&nbsp; in litigation, the allegation would&nbsp; have been sufficient, because plaintiff's prior physical&nbsp; possession may then be implied therefrom.&nbsp; But no such allegation has been made.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, the allegation made is that "before plaintiff could take possession of and occupy said house, defendant surreptitiously and maliciously&nbsp; occupied same without the knowledge and&nbsp; consent of plaintiff" which indicates conclusively that he has had no prior physical possession of the property.&nbsp; And there is absolutely no allegation, whether express or implied, as to whether the vendors&nbsp; have ever&nbsp; had such prior physical possession, and this made it impossible for the, respondent Court to acquire jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, plaintiff based his action upon the ownership of the house by virtue of a deed of conveyance to him. The alternative reliefs he prayed for are all predicated upon such&nbsp; right of ownership.&nbsp; Respondent Court was, therefore, without jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case and all of its proceedings thereon are accordingly null and void.<br><br>Writ of execution issued and judgment rendered by respondent Court are hereby set aside, with costs&nbsp; against respondents to Nicasio Sanchez and Sheriff of Manila.<br><br><i>Yulo, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras</i> and <i>Bocobo, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
