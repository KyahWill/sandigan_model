				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From March 12, 1956, up to July 23,  1966, Patricio Pabores was a mason-carpenter helper in  the employ of the Union Construction  Co., Inc., with a daily  wage of P4.50. During that time, the company was undertaking the construction of the building of the liberty Oil Factory at Highway 54,  Quezon City.<br><br>On July  19, 1956, at about 12:10  p.m.,  while most of the workers were taking their noon-day meal, they heard an unusual sound from the direction of  the unfinished toilet of the edifice under construction and upon investigation, they found Patricio Pabores unconscious, his body sprawled on  the ground beside the shock absorber  of an airplane which had  been  dug out of the compound by the workers the day before,  and with  a  bleeding thigh.  He  was brought to the North  General Hospital  and was admitted into the Emergency  Ward  at 2:05 p.m.  After his wound, which was  about 1 1/2 inches  long, was sutured  and dressed,  he was allowed to go home.  On  July 22, 1956, however,  he was readmitted  upon his complaint of pain in the injured part of his body,  and at five o'clock in the afternoon of the following day, he expired.  The cause of death  was certified to as gas gangrene. <br><br>Upon his death,  Pabores was  survived by a legitimate daughter  had with his deceased wife, a 12-year old  girl named Magdalena, and 2  allegedly  acknowledged natural children, i.e., a daughter named Prima, 1 year and 9 months old,  and a son Jaime, age 9  months.   Said heirs, represented by their guardians, filed  a claim for compensation for the death of their father with the Workmen's Compensation Commission against the Union Construction  Co., Inc., and the Liberty Gil Factory (W. C. case No. 44914). Hearing was duly held, and although there was no eyewitness to the occurrence, the referee who conducted the investigation, apparently relying on the report of the Quezon City Police Department  whieh  investigated  the incident, rendered a decision dated December 12, 1956, finding that the deceased must have tried to  tamper or tinker with the shock absorber of the airplane found in the scene of the mishap which caused the injury when the compressed air was released, and held that as the death did not arise out of his employment, it was not compensable. <br><br>From this decision,  claimants appealed to the Commissioner  who, on January  9, 1957, affirmed the decision  of the referee declaring that he found no error in said decision to warrant a  modification or  reversal thereof.  Hence, claimants filed the instant petition  seeking to review and reverse the decision of  the  Commissioner denying their claim for compensation by reason of the death of Patricio Pabores. <br><br>Petitioners herein charged that the referee rendered the decision of December 12, 1956, before their memorandum was received by that Commission and thus failed to consider certain points stressed, therein.  Respondents, on the other hand, contend that the  memorandum was filed  out of time.  It can be gathered, from the record, that the parties were really allowed to file their respective memoranda up to the morning of December 12,  1956, and as claimants mailed their memorandum in the afternoon of said  day, it is understandable that the referee failed to receive the same at the time  agreed  upon. It cannot be denied, however, that claimants' memorandum brought about something which is conspicuously missing in the report of  the investigator  of the Quezon City Police Department and which was minimized  in the referee's decision, i.e., the declaration of  Patricio Pabores to the Physician who attended him at the hospital that he sustained the injury when he  fell from a scaffolding  of the  building  under construction. In this connection,  it is significant to note  that  nobody actually saw the accident; that other than the deceased himself, no one knew what  actually transpired.  As  between the  statement of  the injured laborer,  who, at the time he made such  declaration had no reason  to  state a falsehood as he even expressed  his  disinterestedness  to take any action against his employer, and the  report  of the investigators based on mere conjectures and assumptions, the first version deserves and should be given more weight  than the latter.  However, it must be remembered that a memorandum is but a note to help the memory, the object of which frequently is to help the memory of another person other  than the writer thereof (Bissell  vs. Beckwith, 32 Conn. 509;  Words &amp; Phrases, Vol. 27, p; 29). The memorandum is not evidence and the court or body to whom a memorandum is directed may or may not consider the same.<br><br>There is, however, one point raised by respondents that merit prior consideration.  They called the attention of the Court to the fact that although petitioners received a copy of the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner upholding the ruling of the referee on <span style="font-style: italic;">February 4, 1957,</span> and while it is true that the  petition for review  of said decision was filed with the Supreme Court on <span style="font-style: italic;">February 14, 1957</span>, the notice  of appeal was filed with the Commission only on <span style="font-style: italic;">February 19, 1957</span>.   Rule 44 of the Rules  of Court,  which  equally governs appeals from  decisions  of the Workmen's  Compensation Commission, provides: <br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">How  to Perfect an Appeal.</span>â€”An appeal by certiorari from an  award, order or decision of the  Court of Industrial Relations (or Workmen's Compensation Commission), <span style="font-style: italic;">shall be perfected by filing with said court</span> (or Commission) <span style="font-style: italic;">a notice  of appeal</span>  and with the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari against the adverse party  within <span style="font-style: italic;">ten</span> (10)  days from notice  of the award, order or decision appealed from.  (As amended by  C. A. No.  559). </blockquote>Under the aforequoted provision, the petition for review must  be filed with the Supreme Court and <span style="font-style: italic;">a notice of appeal with the Commission within 10  days from receipt of the decision, order or award sought to be reviewed.</span>  And while to the petitioners goes Our sympathy, We cannot obviate  the fact  that  although the  petition for  review was filed with this  Court within the reglementary  period, petitioners  filed their notice  of appeal with the Commission 5 days late or 15 days after they were notified of  the decision. This is certainly an error fatal to the  present action.   (See Martha Lumber  Co.,  Inc., vs. Lagradante et al., 99 Phil., 434; 52 Off. Gaz., [9] 4230). <br><br>In view of the foregoing, We find it unnecessary to pass upon  the question of whether or not the Commissioner's ruling is not supported  by the evidence on record. Wherefore,   the  instant  petition  is hereby  dismissed, without  pronouncement as to costs.   It is so ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
