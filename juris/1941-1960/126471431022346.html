				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In Special  Proceeding  No. 1448-P of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Julian Florentino,  petitioner, <em>vs.</em> Municipal Board, City Treasurer, and City Auditor, Pasay City, respondents,  (prohibition and mandamus with preliminary injunction) the court rendered a decision on October 22, 1954,  declaring the  petitioner as the  lawful secretary of the Municipal Board of Pasay City, entitled to its pay  and emoluments until December  31,  1955, unless  sooner removed for cause as provided by law; ordering the respondents to pay the  costs; and declaring that  the  latter  are not liable  for the damages and  attorney's fees prayed for by the petitioner.  A copy of this decision was served personally on attorney for the petitioner on October 22, 1954,  by a clerk  employed in the Court  of First Instance of Rizal.   On November 18, 1954, the  petitioner  filed  a motion for the reconsideration of the decision insofar as  it exonerated the respondents from the  payment of damages and attorney's fees, which was denied  on  November 26, 1954.   The petitioner filed a notice of appeal and a cash bond  on December 7, 1954.  The court  dismissed the appeal on the  ground that, as  notice  of  the  decision  was served on the petitioner on October 22, 1954, the petitioner's motion  for reconsideration filed on  November 18, 1954, was beyond the 15-day period fixed in section  17 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, thereby  rendering the decision promulgated  on October  22 final.  Whereupon the present petition  for  mandamus  was filed  in this  Court by  the petitioner to compel the respondent  Judge of  the  Court of First Instance of Rizal, Second  Branch, to  allow petitioner's appeal  and to  transmit  the original  record of Special Proceeding No.  1448-P to  this  Court.</p>
<p>It is argued for  the  petitioner that  the notice of the decision served upon his attorney on October 22, 1954, was not official, because the clerk who effected the service was made to understand  that there should  still  be official service by registered mailâ€”which was never made. This excuse is obviously flimsy.  Under section 3 of  Rule 27  of  the  Rules of Court, service of judgments  may  be made either personally  or by mail,  the first mode being decidedly more expeditious.   His alleged verbal  understanding or instruction  that  he would wait  for official notice  by registered mail, cannot nullify the  legal effect of the personal service  already accepted.  Petitioner's  intimation that it was rather irregular or unusual for a clerk in the  Court of  First  Instance of Rizal to  have made the personal service in question, refers to a matter that concerned only the court and said employee.  Although not shown in the record, we surmise that the clerk hastened to serve a copy on petitioner's counsel as a favor either previously solicited by  the latter or volunteered  by said clerk,  considering  that the petitioner  in the main won the case.  At any  rate, petitioner's  counsel  was free not to accept the personal service.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is dismissed with  costs  against the petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A,, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
