				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On February 12, 1952, the petitioner, and the respondent entered into a 
collective bargaining agreement which, insofar as it affects this case, provides 
as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"'(c) The contracting parties agree that in furtherance of such discipline, 
the following grounds shall be considered as just causes for dismissal without 
notice:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>Culpable violation of the law, rules, and regulations applicable to labor; 
</li><li>Voluntary injury to any fellow employee or officer of the Company; 
</li><li>Willful damage to merchandise, machinery, furniture or equipment of the 
Company; 
</li><li>Smoking in prohibited areas which will endanger the security of the 
establishment; 
</li><li>Drunken and/or disorderly conduct; 
</li><li>Dishonesty; 
</li><li>Punching somebody else's card; 
</li><li>Unauthorized possession of firearms or other deadly weapons; 
</li><li>Inefficiency or reiterated lack of courtesy and service; 
</li><li>Lack of respect or courtesy to customers; 
</li><li>Habitual lateness. </li></ol></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'd. In obedience of economic principles, closing of a department or 
recession, of the business shall also serve as ground for the dismissal of 
employees.</p>
<p>" 'e. In cases of dismissal of permanent, regular or full-time employees, not 
governed by clauses C, the Company agrees to give 30 days notice or 30 days pay 
in lieu thereof.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>The dismissal by the respondent of two of its employees, Emilia David and 
Miguel Pañganiban, caused the petitioner, National Labor Union, to file in the 
Court of Industrial Relations on March 14, 1953, a petition, alleging that said 
dismissal was without any just cause, and praying that the respondent be ordered 
to reinstate them with back pay from January 31, 1953. The respondent filed an 
answer, alleging that the grounds for the dismissal were immorality, 
inefficiency, disorderly conduct and culpable violation of existing rules and 
regulations of the company, and praying that the petition be denied and the 
petitioner ordered to pay P500 under the counterclaim set up by the respondent. 
Associate Judge Juan L. Lanting rendered a decision dated June 12, 1953, finding 
that the "respondent has failed to prove by preponderance of evidence the 
charges or offenses attributed to Emilia David and Miguel Pañganiban, but 
denying the petition on the ground that their dismissal was justified under 
clause (<em>c</em>) of the collective bargaining agreement which allows the 
respondent to dismiss any employee even without cause provided that it gives him 
30 days' notice or 30 days' pay in lieu of such notice. Judge Lanting denied the 
respondent's counter-claim. The motion for reconsideration filed by the 
petitioner was denied by the Court of Industrial Relations <em>in banc</em> in 
its resolution of July 13, 1953, by a vote of three to two. The case is now 
before us on appeal by certiorari taken by the petitioner.</p>
<p>The collective bargaining agreement entered into between the petitioner and 
respondent enumerates in clauses (<em>c</em>) and (<em>d</em>) specific grounds 
for dismissal of respondent's employees, and the Court of Industrial Relations 
found as a fact that the employees herein involved were not dismissed on any of 
said grounds The only question that arises is whether clause (<em>e</em>) of the 
agreement providing that "in cases of dismissal of permanent, regular or 
fulltime employees, not governed by clause (<em>c</em>), the Company agrees to 
give 30 days notice or 30 day pay in lieu thereof," authorizes the respondent to 
dismiss any employee even without cause, on condition that it gives 30 days' 
notice or 30 days' pay in lieu thereof. Our answer has, without any hesitancy, 
to be in the negative. It is significant that the petitioner and the respondent, 
in their collective bargaining agreement, had undertaken to limit the grounds 
for dismissal to those listed in clauses (<em>c</em>) and (<em>d</em>), and we 
do not think that clause (<em>e</em>) was added to serve as a blanket authority 
for the respondent to dismiss on any ground other than those already specified, 
or even without cause. The more logical construction is that clause (<em>e</em>) 
was inserted in the agreement for the benefit of respondent's employees who may 
be dismissed by the respondent, not on any ground under clause (<em>c</em>), but 
for causes pointed out in clause (<em>d</em>), namely, closing of a department 
or recession of business. We say this is logical, because if an employee is 
dismissed for any cause enumerated in clause (<em>c</em>), it is fair that the 
company should not be required to give 30 days' notice or 30 days' pay in lieu 
thereof; whereas if any employee is separated due to the closing of a department 
or recession of the business of the respondent, it is also fair that the 
innocent employee be at least entitled to a 30-day notice or 30 days' pay in 
lieu thereof. This construction is also borne out by the very term of clause 
(<em>e</em>) which expressly mentions dismissals not governed by clause 
(<em>c</em>) necessarily restricting its application only to separations under 
clause (<em>d</em>). It is difficult to believe that the petitioner, in entering 
into the collective bargaining agreement, could have bartered the right of its 
members to feel secure in their employment, for a month's pay.</p>
<p>The contention of counsel for respondent that the latter should be allowed to 
dismiss the employees herein involved, for the reason that they had already lost 
its confidence, can not be sustained since the alleged loss of confidence must 
necessarily have resulted from the grounds which prompted the respondent to 
dismiss them; and inasmuch as the Court of Industrial Relations has found said 
grounds to be unsubstantiated, there can be no valid reason for said loss of 
confidence.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby reversed and the respondent 
ordered to reinstate Emilia David and Miguel Panganiban with back pay from 
January 31, 1953. So ordered with costs against the respondent.</p>
<p><em>Jugo</em> and <em>Labrador, JJ,</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>PABLO, M.</strong> <em>concurrente</em>:</p>
<p>En 12 de febrero de 1952 la Berg Department Store, Inc. y la National Labor 
Union entraron en un convenio (Exhibito A) sobre las condiciones de empleo y 
establecieron las causas por las cuales un empleado podia ser despedido. En 31 
de enero de 1953 la Berg Department Store, Inc. despidio a Emilia David y Miguel 
Pañganiban, cada uno de los cuales percibia, como empleados de la primera, un 
sueldo mensual de P130 y de P160, respectivamente. En 3 de febrero del mismo año 
la National Labor Union, de la que son miembros dichos empleados, pidio la 
reposicion de los mismos, pero la peticion no fue atendida. Como habia mas de 
trienta miembros de la recurrente que trabajaban en dicho establecimiento 
comercial y era inminente que se declarasen en huelga a menos que se resolviera 
la reclamacion, la recurrente presento su solicitud en la presente causa, 
pidiendo que el Tribunal de Relaciones Industriales ordenase la reposicion de 
Emilia David y Miguel Panganiban y el pago de sus sueldoa devengados a contar 
del 31 de enero de 1953 hasta su reposicion.</p>
<p>En contestation, la recurrida alego que Emilia David y Miguel Panganiban 
fueron despedidos por inmoralidad, ineficiencia, conducta desordenada y culpable 
infraction de los reglamentos de la compania. Vista la causa, el Tribunal 
sobreseyo la solieitud. Una parte de la decision dice asi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon the whole, the court finds that respondent haa failed to prove 
preponderance or evidence the charges or offenses attributed to Emilia David and 
Miguel Pañganiban.</p>
<p>"However, the dismissal of Emilia David and Miguel Panganiban is justified 
under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement marked as Exhibit 
"A" for petitioner and Exhibit "3" for respondent."</p></blockquote>
<p>El articulo V del convenio es del tenor siguiente:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(c) The contracting parties agree that in furtherance of euch discipline, 
the "following ground shall be considered as just causes for dismissal without 
notice:</p>
<ol><li>Culpable violation of the law, rules and regulation applicable to labor; 
</li><li>Voluntary injury to any fellow employee or officer of the Company; 
</li><li>Willful damages to merchandise, machinery, furniture, or equipment of the 
Company; 
</li><li>Smoking in prohibited areas which will endanger the security of the 
establishment; 
</li><li>Drunken and/or disorderly conduct; 
</li><li>Dishonesty; 
</li><li>Punching somebody else's time card; or doctoring one's own time card; 
</li><li>Unauthorized possession of firearms or other deadly weapons; 
</li><li>Inefficiency or reiterated lack of courtesy and service; 
</li><li>Lack of respect or courtesy to customers; 
</li><li>Habitual lateness. </li></ol>
<p>(d) In obedience to economic principles, closing of a department or recession 
of the business shall also serve as ground for the dismissal of employees.</p>
<p>"(e) In cases of dismissal of permanent, regular or full-time employees, not 
governed by clause C, the Company agrees to give 30 days notice or 30 days pay 
in lieu thereof."</p></blockquote>
<p>Despues de discutir los terminos del convenio, el Tribunal concluyo: "* * * 
the company could dismiss any employee for any cause not enumerated in clause 
(C) or even without cause, provided that the company gives 30 days' notice or 30 
days' pay in lieu of such notice."</p>
<p>La mocion de reconsideracion fue denegada, con la disidencia de dos miembros 
del Tribunal. En sintesis, el Tribunal Industrial concluyo que no se han probado 
las acusaciones de inmoralidad, ineficiencia, conducta desordenada y culpable 
infraccion de los reglamentos contra Emilia David y Miguel Pafiganiban; pero que 
la compania tenia derecho a despedirles, aiin sin justo motivo, dandoles una 
mesada.</p>
<p>En recurso de certiorari, la National Labor Union contiende que el Tribunal 
Industrial erro al declarar que el patrono puede despachar a los empleados sin 
justa causa.</p>
<p>Segun el convenio transcrito, el patrono puede despachar sin aviso a los que 
comotieren las faltas enumeradas en el parafo (C); como Emilia y Miguel no han 
cometido falta alguna, entonces fueron indebidamente despachados: deben, pues, 
continuar en su empleo.</p>
<p>De acuerdo con el parrafo (D), el cierre del establecimiento por exigencias 
economicas es otro motivo para el despido de un empleado; pero como en dicho 
caso el empleado no comete ninguna falta, justo es que se le de un aviso previo 
de 30 dias o sueldo de un mes.</p>
<p>La contencion de la Berg Department Store, Inc., fundada en la clausula (E) 
de que puede despachar a sus empleados aun sin justa causa, carece de 
fundamento. Di cha clausula es equivalente al articulo 303 del Codigo de 
Comercio; bajo dicho codigo podia el patrono despachar a su empleado si le daba 
un aviso de 30 dias o el sueldo de un mes. Este articulo ya fue derogado por el 
articulo 2270 del Codigo Civil de Filipinas en 30 de agosto de 1950, un ario y 
meaio antes del otorgamiento del convenio Exhibit A. ?Es exigible este convenio? 
Creemos que no. Un contrato que revive una disposicion legal expresamente 
derogaaa no tiene razon de ser: no puede prevalecer la voluntad de las partes a 
la del Congreso. Dicho contrato es nulo porque es contrario a la politica 
justicialista del articuio 19 de la Ley del Commonwealth No. 103, tal como fue 
enmendada por la Ley No. 355 e interpretada por este Tribunal en The Manila 
Electric Co. contra la National Labor Union:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court of Industrial Relations has the right and authority, under section 
19 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, to order tha readmission of the three laborers 
concerned for the reasons in the resolution complained of. The right of an 
employer to freely select or discharge his employees is subject to regulation by 
the State basically in the exercise of its paramount police power (Commonwealth 
Acts Nos. 103 and 213) * * * and in cases where the sus- pension or dismissal of 
an employee in whimsical or unjustified or its otherwise illegal, the employee 
will be protected. Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. <em>vs</em>. Zulueta, G. R. 
No. 46853). In the present case, the Court of Industrial Relations has found 
that there is no justifiable cause for the dismissal of laborers Sta. A., B, and 
F. These laborers had not been guilty of any illegal act against the 
petitioner." (40 Off. Gaz., (Supp. No. 13), 132.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Lo transcrito establece la doctrina de proporcionar a los empleados, obreros 
o apareceros de las empresas comerciales, industriales y agrjcolas la misma 
estabilidad de que gozan los funcionarios y empleados del gobierno, o sea, que 
no se les puede privar de su empleo sin justa causa.</p>
<p>El Codigo de Comercio fue aprobado bajo el regimen capitalista en que la 
voluntad del patrono e inclusive su capricho era ley y se concedia al empleado 
despedido un mes de sueldo; pero en el decurso de loa tiempos las re- formas 
sociales han ido concretandose en leyes positivas y pronunciamientos judiciales, 
y una de las conquistas de la clase laboral es la de que no se puede despachar 
al empleado sin motivo justificado. La clase obrera es debil, no esta en 
condiciones de luchar frajo las condiciones economicas actuates y necesita ser 
protegida por el Estado,</p>
<p>A medida que progresa la industria con la ayuda de maquinarias se multiplican 
los obreros sin trabajo; con menos trabajadores el patrono puede producir 
m&amp;s. Es que la maquina desplaza al obrero. Si no se limitara el poder del 
patrono de despachar a sus empleados, imponiendo como condicion una justa causa, 
muchos serian despedidos para ser sustituidos por otros con menos compensation. 
Cada vez que el patrono observare que algiin empleado intenta solicitar el 
mejormiento de las condiciones del trabajo se le podria despachar dandole un mes 
de sueldo o avisandole el despido con un mes de anticipation. Para el obrero o 
empleado que vive al dia, una mesada es un mes de vida; pero para el patrono es 
una limosna, y nada mas. El mes de aviso de la destitution del empleado trae 
consigo la preocupacion—en donde hallar trabajo—pues, segun la prensa, hay mas 
de dos milliones de hombres sin trabajo. No es necesario estar en lugar del 
obrero que recibe el aviso para tener idea de lo que sentiria o podria sufrir 
mientras no encuentra trabajo: un calvario . . .</p>
<p>Con este procedimiento las agrupaciones obreras quedarian despojadas de los 
medios que las leyes obreras las han proporcionado; una simple intention de 
pedir un aumento de sueldo o cualquier otra cosa, la mas baladi, o ya porque el 
amo quiere aumentar sus rendimientos podria ser motivo de despido y, a cambio de 
tres, cuatro o cien obreros despachados, habria mil solicitantes. Siguiendo la 
ley economica de oferta y demanda, el crecido numero de parados abarataria la 
mano de obra, el patrono podria despedir a sus obreros y admitir otros con 
sueldos ridiculamente bajos, en perjuicio de la salud de estos y del publico en 
general.</p>
<p>El trabajo ya no es una simple mercancia que esta sujeta al flujo y reflujo 
de la demanda del mercado: hoy se tiene en cuenta un factor importante, la 
dignidad del obrero. El trabajo humano no puede equipararse a una libra de 
patatas que se vende en el mercado publico: el trabajo del hombre se arrienda 
bajo la ley del jornal mfmimo. Por imperativos del bien publico el Estado vela 
por los que viven con el sudor de su frente. Al trabajador de hoy se le una 
razonable participation'en el producto de su trabajo. No se tienen solo en 
cuenta las ganancias del capital, sino que se vigila tambien por el Estado que 
al jornal que se de al obrero le sea suficiente para vivir. Con esta nueva 
doctrina social se dignifica el trabaja y se humaniza el capital; para que surta 
su efecto bienhechor, es necesario fortificarla con otras decisiones; es 
indispensable asegurar a los obreros y empleados cierta estabilidad en su 
trabajo para que no sean presas del descontento. No debemos olvidar que el 
descontento es el germeh que corros a las masas desheredadas. Es necesario 
darles oportunidad de ganar el pan de cada dia, oportunidad de tener albergue y 
descanso, oportunidad de concebir alguna esperanza de mejorar de condicion 
social. Entonces se sentiran contentas y no caeran facilmente victiraas del 
comunismo.</p>
<p>Se podria arguir que en 12 del junio de 1954 se aprobo la Ley de la Republics 
No. J052 que viene a revivir el articulo 303 del Codigo de Comercio. Esta ley no 
puede afectar el presente asunto que tuvo lugar en 12 de febrero de 1952; no 
puede perjudicar a los empleados Emilia David y Miguel Panganiban; solamente 
tiene aplicacion a hechos que han de ocurrir desde su aprobacion para en 
adelante. Pero cuando se percate la Legislatura de que esta medida reaccionaria 
echa por el suelo todas las conquistas logradaa For la clase laboral, siendo una 
de ellas la estabilidad en el trabajo como la de los empleados del gobierno, tal 
vez dara los pasos necesarios para poner las cosas en su jus to lugar. La 
cacareada magna Carta de los obreros se convirtiria en triunfo inutil si, 
despues de todo, un empleado o un obrero puede ser despedido por el patrono con 
darle un mes de sueldo o avisandole de su despido con un mes de 
anticipation.</p>
<p>En conclusion, bajo el Codigo Civil nuevo y la legislation y jurisprudencia 
social, el patrono no tiene derecho a des- pedir a un empleado pagandole un mes 
de sueldo; solamente se le puede despachar por justa causa.</p>
<p>Voto por la reposition de los empleados Emilia David y Miguel Paiiganiban y 
que se les pague todos sus sueldos desde el l.o de febrero de 1953.<br></p>
<p><strong>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>The learned dissenter predicates his opinion on the theory that "in the 
absence of a contract of employment for a specific period, just as an employee 
in a commercial or industrial establishment may quit at any time, singly or 
collectively, with or without cause, so the employer can dismiss an employee at 
any time without cause. This right of the employer is commonly referred to as 
his right to hire and fire his employee in the same way that the employee can 
stop working by himself or go on strike with Jhis fellow employees." And he 
cites American authorities in support thereof.</p>
<p>I fully agree with this theory, but, as already stated, this only holds in 
the absence of a contract of employment entered into between the employer and 
the employee regulating the mode by which the employment may be terminated. This 
is also the theory on which Article 302 of the Code of Commerce, now repealed, 
is predicated: one month pay should be given to an employee who is separated 
when there is no express contract of employment.</p>
<p>The situation here obtaining does not call for the application of such theory 
because the parties had concluded a written contract of employment specifying 
the mode by which it may be terminated. The only issue here involved is one of 
interpretation. In my opinion, that contract is all-inclusive in the sense that 
an employee can only be separated from the service for any of the grounds 
specified in clauses <em>c</em> and <em>d</em>. This is in view of the principle 
<em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</em>. It is for this reason that I 
concur in the opinion of the Chief Justice.<br></p>
<p><strong>REYES, J. B. L., J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>A careful consideration of the opinions of the Chief Justice and Justices 
Pablo and Montemayor, leads me to agree with the first two, at least in the 
result.</p>
<p>The main reason that moves me to believe that clause (<em>e</em>) of the 
collective bargaining agreement in question should not be construed as reserving 
to the employer a right to dismiss his employees engaged without specified 
period upon one month's notice, or upon payment of one month's wages, is this: 
that at the time that the bargaining agreement was entered into (February 12, 
1955), it was the common opinion that such right of the employer did not exist, 
because it had been abrogated since 1950 by the new Civil Code. The doctrine of 
this very Supreme Court in Lara <em>vs</em>. del Rosario, 50 Off. Gaz., (No. 5), 
1975; the enactment of Republic Act No. 1052, undertaking to restore that power 
to the employer; as well as the excerpts from the Congressional Record set forth 
in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Montemayor, are conclusive to the 
effect that the legislature, in enacting the new Civil Code, had in fact 
repealed and taken away the right formerly granted to employers by Art. 302 of 
the Code of Commerce.</p>
<p>So that when the collective agreement was made in 1952, and before Republic 
Act No. 1052 was enacted in 1954, it was at least doubtful if the employer, in 
the absence of express law or stipulation, retained the right of uncontrolled 
dismissal of employees and laborers engaged without fixed periods of employment; 
and, as previously stated, to settle the doubt and to render uncontrovertible 
that the employer could dismiss them at his pleasure, the collective bargaining 
agreement must have expressly conferred the power upon him.</p>
<p>Can it be held that the repeal of article 302 of the Code of Commerce simply 
meant that every employer became authorized to terminate einployment contracts 
for which no term was expressly fixed, and dismiss his laborers at will, without 
benefit of notice or <em>mesada</em>? I think not. <em>Obsta principiis</em>; 
for our law is fundamentally averse to allowing one party to control exclusively 
the validity and effectiveness of his contracts, specially those involving 
labor. Witness Article 1308, the first portion of Article 1182, and Article 1710 
of our Civil Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art. 1308. The contract must bind both contracting parties; its validity or 
compliance cannot be left to the will of one of them."</p>
<p>"Art. 1182. When the fulfillment of the condition depends upon the sole will 
of the debtor, the conditional obligation, shall be void." * * *</p>
<p>"Art. 1710. Dismissal of laborers shall be subject to the supervision of the 
Government, under special laws."</p></blockquote>
<p>Attention may also be called to the provisions of Article 1698 of the new 
Civil Code, requiring notice of dismissal for household helpers engaged for 
undetermined periods. The spirit of this article is certainly incompatible with 
the position that industrial or commercial employees could under the same code, 
be dismissed at will and without notice or indemnity.</p>
<p>But even granting that in 1952 the power existed in the employer to dismiss 
at will, and without cause, those of his laborers and employees that were 
engaged without specified period, the absence of any express mention of that 
power in the collective bargaining agreement should, in my opinion, be 
interpreted in the sense that such power is denied the employer. One of the 
basic purposes of laborers in entering into these agreements is precisely to 
obtain stability in their employment and security in their tenure, in order to 
free themselves of the haunting fear of sudden unemployment without fault on 
their part. The enumeration of causes of dismissal in the contract, must be, 
therefore, regarded as strictly limitative.</p>
<p>The ultimate question, therefore, is not whether the collective agreement 
<em>divested</em> the employer of the right to dismiss employees at any time 
upon 30 days notice or upon payment of <em>mesada</em>; but whether the 
collective agreement <em>granted</em> that power. It is obvious from the letter 
and the spirit of the agreement that no such power was given to the employer. 
</p>
<p>Paragraph (<em>e</em>) of the collective agreement before us does not attempt 
on its face to establish <em>causes</em> of severance of relations, but merely 
to prescribe the <em>manner</em> or method of severance, and, therefore, cannot 
be interpreted as adding to the causes specified in clauses (<em>e</em>) and 
(<em>d</em>). It may be that clause (<em>e</em>) does not meet our own standards 
of clarity and definiteness, or that it could have been made much clearer than 
it is; but any doubt should be resolved in favor of the employees and laborers, 
as expressly prescribed by Articles 24 and 1702 of the new Civil Code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 24. In all contractual, property or other relations, when one of the 
parlies is at a disadvantage on account of his moral dependence, ignorance, 
indigence, mental weakness, tender age or other handicap, the courts must be 
vigilant for his protection." </p>
<p>"Art. 1702. In case of doubt, all labor legislation and all labor contracts 
shall be construed in favor of the safety and decent living for the 
laborer."</p></blockquote>
<p>"Safety and decent living" are broad enough to include stability and security 
of employment.<br></p>
<p><strong>CONCEPCION, J.</strong>, <em>concurring</em>:</p>
<p>I concur in the foregoing concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Reyes 
(J.B.L.).<br></p>
<p><strong>MONTEMAYOR, J.</strong> <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>As stated in the majority opinion, the National Labor Union hereafter 
referred to as the Union and Berg Department Store, Inc., a commercial 
establishment, hereafter referred to as the Department Store, entered into a 
collective bargaining agreement in 1952. For purposes or reference we reproduce 
the pertinent sections of said agreement, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"' (c) The contracting parties agree that in furtherance of auch discipline 
the following grounds shall be considered as just cause for dismissal without 
notice;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>Culpable violation of the law, rules, and regulations applicable to labor; 
</li><li>Voluntary injury to any fellow employee or officer of the Company; 
</li><li>Willful damage to merchandise, machinery, furniture or equipment of the 
Company; 
</li><li>Smoking in prohibited areas which will endanger the security of the 
establishment; 
</li><li>Drunken and/or disorderly conduct; 
</li><li>Dishonesty; 
</li><li>Punching somebody else's card; 
</li><li>Unauthorized possession of firearms or other deadly weapons; 
</li><li>Inefficiency or reiterated lack of courtesy and service; 
</li><li>Lack of respect or courtesy to customers; 
</li><li>Habitual lateness. </li></ol></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"'(<em>d</em>) In obedience to economic principles, closing of a department 
or recession of the business shall also serve as ground for the dismissal of 
employees.</p>
<p>"'(<em>e</em>) In cases of dismissal of permanent, regular or full-time 
employees, not governed by clause C, the Company agrees to give 30 days notice 
or 30 days pay in lieu thereof.'"</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1953 two of the employees of the Department Store belonging to the Union 
were dismissed despite the fact that the charges against them for alleged 
immorality, inefficiency and disorderly conduct and violations of existing rules 
and regulations of the company had not been fully substantiated as found by the 
Court of Industrial Relations. Said court, however, through Judge Lanting denied 
the petition of said two employees for reinstatement and for backpay on the 
ground that under paragraph (<em>e</em>) the Department Store may dismiss its 
employees even without cause provided they are paid one month salary as was 
done. The motion for reconsideration was denied by Judge Lanting and two of his 
colleagues while Judge Bautista dissented in which dissent one of his colleagues 
concurred. The case is now here on appeal.</p>
<p>The question involved is the proper interpretation of the bargaining 
agreement between the Union and the Department Store, particularly paragraph 
(<em>e</em>). The majority upholds the theory of the Union that paragraph 
(<em>e</em>) refers only and exclusively to those employees dismissed under 
paragraph (<em>d</em>) and to no other dismissals. In other words, according to 
the majority, the Department Store under the agreement can dismiss only on the 
grounds enumerated in paragraph (<em>c</em>) such as culpable violation of the 
law, rules, and regulations, willful damage to merchandise, machinery, etc., 
dishonesty, etc., which dismissal required neither notice nor one month pay, and 
those included in paragraph (<em>d</em>) relative to the closing of the store or 
recession of the business which required either 30 days notice or 30 days pay in 
lieu thereof. This theory was rejected by the majority opinion of the Court of 
Industrial Relations.</p>
<p>I quote with approval that portion of the decision penned by Judge Lanting on 
this point. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. It is in the interpretation of clause (<em>e</em>) that the 
contending parties differ. It is the contention of petitioner that said clause 
(<em>e</em>) refers solely and exclusively to dismissals under clause 
(<em>d</em>) While respondent contends that it refers to all dismissals not 
governed by clause (<em>c</em>).</p>
<p>"After studying the provision in question, the Court believes that the 
interpretation given by respondent is the true and correct one. If the intention 
of the contracting parties is what the petitioner claims to be, the requirement 
that the company should give 30 days notice or 30 days pay in lieu thereof 
should have been incorporated in clause (<em>d</em>) instead of being embodied 
in a separate clause or else clause (<em>e</em>) should have been worded as 
follows:</p>
<p>"In cases of dismissal of permanent, regular or full-time employees, 
<em>governed by clause</em> (<em>d</em>), the Company agrees to give 30 days 
notice or 30 days pay in lieu thereof.'</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, however, of using the underlined words, the parties used the words 
not governed by clause "c". This being the case, there seems to be no doubt that 
the company could dismiss any employee for any cause not enumerated in clause 
(<em>c</em>) or even without cause, provided that the company gives 30 days 
notice or SO days' pay in lieu of such notice."</p>
<p>I am in entire accord with the reasoning and conclusion contained in the 
above quotation. If the parties in their agreement really intended the 
provisions of clause (<em>e</em>) to apply exclusively to dismissals under 
clause (<em>d</em>), said provision on notice or payment of the <em>mesada</em> 
should have been incorporated in clause (<em>d</em>) itself saying that the 
closing of a department or the recession of the business in obedience to 
economic principles shall also serve as ground for dismissal of employees and 
that those thus dismissed shall be given 30 days' notice or 30 days' pay in lieu 
thereof; or, if the parties insisted in embodying the notice and the 30 days' 
pay in a separate clause, said separate clause should have referred particularly 
and exclusively to dismissals under clause (<em>d</em>) instead of making it 
general with the exception of clause (<em>c</em>). In other words, we believe 
that the parties meant to extend the benefits of the 30 days' notice or pay to 
all other dismissals except those governed by paragraph (<em>c</em>) due to the 
fault of the employees themselves.</p>
<p>The theory of the majority of this Tribunal is that the collective bargaining 
agreement limits the grounds for all dismissals to those listed in clauses 
(<em>c</em>) and (<em>d</em>), and that outside of those grounds the Department 
Store may not dismiss any employee. This theory is based, apparently, on the 
belief of said majority, which I venture to say, I consider erroneous, that the 
employer, generally, has no right to dismiss his employee without just cause; 
stated conversely, that the employee has an absolute right to feel secure in his 
employment unless he. himself gave cause for lawful dismissal. This may be 
gathered from the statement in the decision of the Chief Justice that clause 
(<em>e</em>) may not "serve as a <em>blanket authority</em> for the respondent 
(Department Store) to dismiss on any ground other than those already specified, 
or even without cause," the majority decision adding that "it is difficult to 
believe that the petitioner (Labor Union), in entering into the collective 
bargaining agreement, could have <em>bartered</em> the right of its members to 
feel secure in their employment, for a month's pay." And, Justice Pablo in his 
concurring opinion dubs Republic Act No. 1052, reactionary legislation because 
it clearly admits the right of an employer to dismiss an employee even without 
cause provided that one month notice or one month pay is given; and he feels 
that laborers and employees in private establishments should be given the same 
security as civil service employees of the Government.</p>
<p>I realize that there is a belief, more or less prevalent, that an employer 
may not dismiss its employees or laborer except for cause, and this belief is 
entertained not only by the layman but also by a portion of the bench and bar as 
well. This belief, to me erroneous, is due in part to certain rulings and 
declarations of some courts ordering the reinstatement of some dismissed 
industrial employees on the ground that they had been dismissed or suspended 
without cause, and also awarding backpay corresponding to the period of 
suspension or dismissal. They overlook the fact that such suspensions or 
dismissals, not infrequently, were made after a dispute had been submitted to 
the Court of Industrial Relations for settlement, or that the employees were 
suspended or dismissed because of union activities, this, all in violation of 
express statutory provisions. It is high time in my opinion that all doubts on 
this point be cleared and that the relation between employer and employees and 
the rights and obligations of.,each be clearly ascertained and defined. Whatever 
the courts, including this Tribunal may, in the past have said about the 
validity or impropriety of dismissals of employees by their employers, the law 
or the rule is and has always been that in the absence of a contract of 
employment for a specific period, just as an employee in a commercial or 
industrial establishments may quit at any time, singly or collectively, with or 
without cause, so the employer can dismiss any employee at any time and without 
cause. This right of the employer is commonly referred to as his right to hire 
and fire his employee in the same way that the employee can stop working by 
himself or go on strike with his fellow employees. Authorities in support of 
this assertion as hardly necessary, but I shall quote some of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Traditionally, employers have enjoyed the right to employ and discharge 
workers at pleasure. They have insisted upon the unfettered exercise of that 
right. The Supreme Court asserts that the right of employers to employ and 
discharge workers has not been impaired by the National Labor Relations Act. 
(Associated Press <em>vs</em>. National Labor Relations Board, 301 U. S. 103 
[1937.]) To the degree, however, that the Federal Act, and state acts patterned 
after it, forbid discrimination because of union connections or activities, they 
restrict the right of employers to hire and discharge at will. The Federal Act 
justifies these restrictions imposed upon employers because the denial by 
employers of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively leads 
to strikes which obstruct commerce. The employee, too, possesses the nominal 
right to withdraw his services, but like his employer, is restrained from doing 
so if it can be shown that public safety or welfare is jeopardized by his act. A 
number of state laws have aet forth unfair labor practices prohibited to both 
employers and employees. Thus, while both our legislative and judicial branches 
of government affirm the <em>venerated right</em> of employment under free 
contracts—the freedom on the part of the employer to employ or to discharge, 
and, on the part of the employee, to severe his connections with his employer at 
will—these governmental agencies have qualified that right in so far as its 
exercise seems to conflict with public interests." (Dr. Albion Guilford Taylor 
on Labor Problems and Labor Law, 2nd Ed., 1950, pp. 399-400).</p>
<p>"Although the attitude of the court towards social legislation affecting the 
right of an employer to discharge employees at will has undergone some change 
in. recent years, it may still be said that ordinarily, any act which undertakes 
to impose upon any employer the obligation to keep in his service one whom he 
does Dot desire is unconstitutional. In the present era of social change and 
widespread labor legislation, the constitutionality of a law prohibiting the 
discharge of an employer because of his membership in a labor union has been 
upheld." (National Labor Relations Board <em>vs</em>. Jones &amp; L. Steel 
Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 81 L. ed. 893, 108 A. L. R. 1352). (Francisco Labor Laws, 
Sec. 54, p. 26).</p>
<p>"A general contract of hiring is ordinarily deemed a contract terminable at 
the will of either the employer or the employee.</p>
<p>"In the absence of something in the contract of employment to fix a definite 
term of service, or other contractual provision to restrict the right of the 
employer to discharge, or some statutory restriction upon this right, an 
employer may lawfully discharge an employee at what time he pleases and for what 
cause he chooses, without thereby becoming liable to an action against him." (35 
Am. Jur., (sec. 34, pp. 469-470. Anno. 34 A. L. R. 824). (Fran- cisco, Labor 
Laws, p. 673).</p></blockquote>
<p>This right of the employer, in the absence of a contract fixing a period of 
employment, to dismiss its employee has always been recognized in this 
jurisdiction. Article 302 of the Code of Commerce provides that where the 
contract does not have a fixed period, anyone of the parties (employer and 
employee) may terminate it upon giving one month advance notice thereof to the 
other. Under this codal provision the courts, including the Court of Industrial 
Relations had been awarding a month's pay or <em>mesada</em> not only to 
commercial employees as contemplated by the Code of Commerce but even to 
industrial employees or laborers. This means that in the absence of a contract 
fixing the period of employment, the employees may quit at any time and the 
employer may dismiss him at any time, in either case even without cause, by 
giving one month notice in advance; in the absence of such notice the employee 
laid-off or dismissed is entitled to one month pay.</p>
<p>This traditional right of the employer to dismiss his employee without cause 
is properly recognized, may, taken for granted in the new law (Republic Act No. 
1052) entitled <em>"An Act to provide for the manner of terminating employment 
withovJb a definite period in commercial, industrial, or agricultural 
establishment or enterprise."</em> The Congress of the Philippines thru this Act 
unequivocally acknowledges and recognizes the right of the employer to dismiss 
his employee without cause. Because of the repeal of Article 302 of the Code of 
Commerce by the new Civil Code, and because of said repeal, Congress felt that 
in the absence of a contract of employment for fixed period, employees and 
laborers dismissed without cause, were no longer entitled to the 
<em>mesada</em>, even in the absence of notice of dismissal or lay-off, said 
Republic Act was passed.</p>
<p>To dissipate any lingering doubt about the recognition by Republic Act No. 
1052, of this right of the employer to dismiss an employee without cause, we may 
refer to the legislative proceedings in both Houses of Congress when the Act in 
the form of a bill was discussed. The bill sponsored by Senator Primicias had 
the following explanatory note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In repealing the provisions of the Code of Commerce on agency, including 
Article 302 thereof governing the payment of one month's salary to dismissed 
employees, the new Civil Code provides in Article 1710 that the 'dismissal of 
laborers shall be subject to the supervision of the government, under special 
laws.' But, when the said Civil Code took effect, no special law was enacted 
<em>to protect rights of many workers who, since then, have been dismissed from 
their employment</em> without the benefit of one month's compensation.</p>
<p>"To fill the void left by the enforcement of the aforesaid Code, immediate 
approval of the attached bill is, therefore strongly recommended." (Italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>The same bill was sponsored in the lower house by Congressman Tolentino who 
made the following brief remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Speaker, this is a bill providing that employees shall be given a 
previous notice at least one month <em>before the termination of their 
employment, where there is no fixed period."</em> (Italics 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>The discussion of the bill in the Senate by senators Primicias and Sumulong 
is enlightening. Senator Sumulong made the following remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. Mr. President, when a contract of employment contains a definite 
period, that is when the employment is for a fixed period of time, it is well 
established that upon the expiration of the period agreed upon, the employment 
is terminated without heed of notice <em>and without showing any cause</em>. 
Now, under Article 302 of the Code of Commerce, wliose repeal motivated the 
presentation of the original bill on the subject matter, there is a provision 
<em>that when the contract for employment does not provide for a definite period 
of time either party may terminate the employment upon one month's advance 
notice</em>, in which case the employee would be entitled to compensation for 
that month. That provision in Article 302 of the Code of Commerce, I understand, 
is based on the experience of ages and establishes a very sound rule that when 
the employment does not provide for a definite period of time, it is only fair 
that before it is terminated the employer should be notified by the employee or, 
vice-versa, the employee should be notified by the employer before the 
employment is terminated. That is only reasonable because when there is no 
definite period agreed upon you have <em>to give the employee a reasonable time 
to look another employment before terminating the contract."</em> (Congressional 
Record, Senate, Vol. I, No. 24, p. 317; italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Sumulong continuing, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have no objection that the employee should be given one month notice by 
the employer to terminate employment without fixed period, as provided for in 
the amendment by substitution, but I am only suggesting; is it not also 
reasonable that the same consideration be extended to the employer?" 
(Congressional Becord, Senate, Vol. I, No. 24, p. 319)</p>
<p>"With due respect to the opinion of the Majority Floor Leader, I wish to call 
the attention of the Senate that we have before us here a bill in which the 
subject is how can a contract of employment without a fixed period be 
terminated? Now, why should we not provide how it can be terminated by the 
employer? Why don't we make it clear as to how it can be terminated by the 
employer? <em>I have made a little study of this and the general principle is 
that when a contract of employment is without a fixed period, in the absence of 
a statute regarding how it can, be terminated by either side, the contract can 
be terminated at any time without need of thowing cause—That is the general 
principle</em>, and that is the necessity for this bill, so that the employee 
can be safeguarded and protected, that his employment cannot be terminated 
without being given one month's notice. I am for that." (Id., p. 320; italics 
supplied).</p>
<p>"* * *. In case of a contract where there is a definite period agreed upon, 
there is no need of notice because both parties are notified that upon a certain 
date the employment will terminate. That is the reason why no notice is required 
because the employee before the expiration date can prepare to look for another 
employment and the employer also, before the arrival of the expiration date, can 
look for other employees to take the place of thoss whose employment will be 
terminated. But when the contract does not specify a definite period of 
employment, there is where the necessity of notice arises, because neither side 
knows when the employment will terminate. <em>That is why it is fair to the 
employees that before his services are dispensed, with, he should be told one 
month in advance. 'Mr. Employee, one month from today your services will no 
longer be required. You can look for other places where you can employ 
yourself.' </em>That is entirely fair. That is the provision of the amendment by 
substitution with which I heartily concur. But in the case of the employer also, 
when he does not know when the employment will terminate, I think that he should 
also be notified by the employee: 'Mr. Employer, unfortunately I cannot continue 
until the date, so that one month from now you can look for others to take my 
place/ That is reasonable. We are protecting labor and, at the same time, we are 
being reasonable with management and capital, and being fair and reasonable to 
both labor and capital, we are insuring the industrial and commercial progress 
of this country. But when we become one sided, when we become myopic in our 
philosophy, when we think only of pleasing labor, and I am pleasing labor, we 
are in fact committing a disservice, because labor cannot exists unless there is 
management and capital to cooperate with it. If we kill the man who has the 
capital and the management who build all industrial establishments in this 
country, then I am afraid that we are defeating the very purpose of this bill 
because in the end labor also will suffer from our injustices to the employer." 
(Id., pp. 321-322; italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Primicias had the following to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. This bill is presented in the sense that <em>that there are many 
laborers laid-off now without protection</em>. When I was yet the humble 
chairman of the Committee on Labor, I received many complaints of <em>laborers 
being laid-off without being paid the proper indemnity</em>. I know there are 
many establishments, many factories which are dignified and law-abiding and 
because of the lack of the provisions of law, are not paying their laborers 
whenever they leave their employment. But on the other hand, there are also many 
establishments, especially those controlled by aliens, <em>which dismiss 
laborers without notice</em>. This is urgent. We should protect them. 
(Congressional Record, Senate, Vol. I, pp. 319-320 italics 
supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>From all the foregoing; it is quite clear that the bill was passed in both 
houses of Congress with the understanding that the employer in the absence of a 
contract of employment for a certain period and unless prohibited by statutory 
provision, always had the right to dismiss his employee at any time and without 
cause and because of this right, and because many laborers and employees had 
been dismissed without cause, to give them the protection or benefit, the bill 
was passed and is now Republic Act No. 1052.</p>
<p>I repeat that Republic Act No. 1052 never meant or intended to give the 
employer a new right, which he never had before,—that of dismissing an employee 
without cause, because the employer all along and always had that traditional 
right. Republic Act No. 1052 did nothing more than recognize and take that right 
for granted, at the same time, saving to the employee the right of the "mesada" 
which he lost by repeal of Article 302 of the Code of Commerce.</p>
<p>We may not say as does Mr. Justice Pablo in his opinion concurring in that of 
the majority that Republic Act No. 1052 is a reactionary legislation because in 
his opinion said act destroys the conquest of labor, one of which was the 
stability of his employment, which the Chief Justice calls the security of 
employment. As already demonstrated, there has never been such stability or 
security of employment except when provided for in statutory provision, like 
these acts I shall later enumerate. Republic Act 1052 could not have destroyed 
what had never existed. All it did was, as already stated, to recognize the 
instability and insecurity of employment, and to extend partial protection of 
the laborer against the same.</p>
<p>The same concurring opinion of Justice Pablo places the supposed security of 
a laborer or employee in a private establishment on the same level or footing of 
that of a Government employee. He apparently overlooked that fact that not only 
the law (Sec. 694, Rev. Adm. Code) but the Constitution itself (Art. XII, Sec. 
4) expressly prohibits the removal or suspension of a civil service employee 
except for cause provided by law. A private employee or laborer unfortunately, 
is not included in that prohibition.</p>
<p>Of course, this clear right of dismissal or suspension of an employee is 
subject to the paramount police power of the State, and under said police power, 
the Legislatures in most jurisdiction including ours have from time to time 
promulgated laws regulating and restricting this right of an employer to dismiss 
his employee without cause, forbidding it in cases where the dismissal would 
affect public interests. And it is interesting to note that even the right of an 
employee or laborer to quit work or to strike is similarly regulated and 
limited. I may mention some of our laws on this point that readily come to mind. 
Section 19 of Commonwealth Act 103 provides that in every contract of employment 
or tenancy, it is an implied condition that when any dispute between the 
employer or landlord and the employee, tenant or laborer has been submitted to 
the Court of Industrial Relations for settlement or arbitration or when the 
President of the Philippines has ordered an investigation in accordance with 
section 5 of the Act with a view to determining the necessity and fairness or 
fixing and adopting a minimum wage or share of laborers or tenants, and pending 
award, or decision by the Court of such dispute or during the pendency of the 
investigation above referred to, <em>the employee, tenant, or laborer shall not 
strike or walk out of his employment when so enjoined by the Court</em> after 
hearing and when the public interest so requires, and if he has already done so 
that <em>he shall forwith return to it</em> and that pending such dispute or 
investigation the employer or landlord shall refrain from accepting other 
employees, tenants, or laborers, unless with express authority of the court; 
<em>that no employer or landlord shall suspend, lay-off, or dismiss any 
employee, laborer, tenant, or farm-laborer without just cause from the time a 
labor association or organization or group of laborers or tenants or 
farm-laborers has presented to an employer or landlord a petition or 
complaint</em> regarding any matter likely to cause a strike or lockout or while 
an industrial or agricultural dispute is pending before the court; and that if 
it is proved that during the said period an employee or laborer, tenant, or 
farm-laborer has been suspended or dismissed without just cause, the court may 
<em>direct his reinstatement and the payment of his salary</em> or wage during 
the suspension or dismissal.</p>
<p>Section 21 of the same law (Commonwealth Act 103) provides that it shall be 
unlawful for any employer <em>to discharge</em> or to <em>threaten to 
discharge</em>, or in any other manner discriminate against, any laborer or 
employee because such employer believes that <em>he may testify in any 
investigation, proceeding or public hearing</em> conducted by the court.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Act 213 provides that any person, landlord, corporation or their 
agents who intimidate or coerce any employee or laborer or tenant under their 
employ with intent of preventing such employee or laborer or tenant from joining 
any registered legitimate labor organization of his own choosing, or, <em>who 
dismiss or threaten to dismiss such employee or laborer or tenant from his 
employment for having joined, or for being a member of any registered legitimate 
labor organization</em> shall be guilty of a felony.</p>
<p>Republic Act 679 provides that it shall be unlawful for any employer <em>to 
discharge any woman employed</em> by him who may be pregnant for the purpose of 
preventing such woman <em>from enjoying the benefits of Section 7 of the 
Act</em> or to discharge such woman while on leave <em>on account of her 
pregnancy</em> or confinement; also that it shall be unlawful for any employer 
<em>to discharge any woman or child</em> employed by him for having <em>filed a 
complaint</em> under this Act or to discharge such woman and child or any other 
employee <em>who has given testimony</em> or is about to give testimony under 
this Act.</p>
<p>Republic Act No. 602 known as the Minimum Wage Law in its section 13 provides 
that after the effective date of the Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to 
<em>discharge</em> or in any manner to discriminate against <em>any 
employee</em> because such employee has <em>filed any complaint</em> or 
instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to the 
Act, or <em>has testified</em> or is about to testify in any such proceeding, or 
has served or is about to serve on a Wage Board.</p>
<p>Republic Act No. 875 known as the Magna Carta of Labor, in its section 14, 
paragraph (<em>a</em>)-5, provides that it shall be unfair labor practice for an 
employer <em>to dismiss, discharge,</em> or otherwise prejudice or discriminate 
against <em>an employee for having filed charges</em> or for having given or 
being about to give testimony under this Act.</p>
<p>From all the foregoing, we may safely conclude that unless regulated or 
restricted by express statutory provision such as those above enumerated, an 
employer may freely dismiss his employee or laborer provided that under Republic 
Act No. 1052 like Article 302 of the Code of Commerce, he gives one month notice 
in advance or gives one month pay in lieu thereof. In other words, the 
traditional and age-old right of an employee or laborer to quit singly or 
collectively at any time and without cause and the right of the employer to 
dismiss his employee or laborer at any time and without cause, still exist 
although qualified and restricted by statutory provisions.</p>
<p>At the time the two employees in question were dismissed by the Department 
Store there was no such dispute pending investigation, hearing or decision by 
the Court of Industrial Relations. Neither were they dismissed because of their 
membership in any labor union or for any union activities or that they had filed 
any complaint against the Department Store or because they have testified or 
were about to testify against the <em>Department Store</em>. The <em>Department 
Store</em> under the conditions and circumstances obtaining at the time of the 
dismissal had the right to dismiss the two employees, unless of course, the 
bargaining agreement clearly prohibited such dismissal Bearing in mind this 
right of an employer to dismiss an employee even without cause, enjoyed by the 
<em>Department Store</em> at the time the bargaining agreement was entered into, 
the scope of clause (<em>e</em>) becomes clear. I maintain as does the majority 
of the Court of Industrial Relations that the provisions of the bargaining 
agreement particularly sections (<em>c</em>), (<em>d</em>) and (<em>e</em>) are 
clear; that clause (<em>e</em>) referred not only to dismissals under section 
(<em>d</em>) but also to other dismissals even without cause.</p>
<p>The majority opinion thru the Chief Justice says that clause (<em>e</em>) 
could not serve as a blanket authority for the Department. Store to dismiss on 
any ground other than those specified, or even without cause. But such blanket 
authority was not needed by the Department Store because it already and always 
possessed that right as I have endeavored to show. The same majority opinion 
says that the petitioning union in entering into a collective bargaining could 
not have <em>bartered</em> the right of its members to feel secure in their 
employment, for a month's pay. I am afraid this assertion is based on a misconr 
ception of the supposed right of the employee. Barter implies the possession or 
ownership of something,—a right or property, to be given in exchange for 
another. The members of the union at the time of the bargaining agreement was 
entered into, did not have the right to feel secure in their employment for the 
simple reason that because there was no contract of employment for a fixed 
period, said employment could be terminated at any time and without cause. 
Consequently, the members of the union had nothing to <em>barter</em> or 
exchange for a month's pay.</p>
<p>I wish to make it clear that in showing or in trying to show that an employer 
in the absence of an agreed period of employment, and unless prohibited by 
express provision of law has the right to dismiss employees and laborers at any 
time and without cause, I am not advocating nor am I unconditionally in favor of 
such right of the employer. I am merely stating a fact and a rule. Whether such 
right of an employer should further be restricted or qualified is not for the 
judiciary to determine. That belongs to the Legislative Department.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, I agree with the majority of the Judges of the 
Industrial Court that under clause (e) of the bargaining agreement the 
Department Store was authorized to dismiss the two employees in question even 
without cause, provided that it paid them one month salary which it did; 
consequently, the decision appealed from should be affirmed.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla</em> and <em>Reyes, A., JJ.</em>, concur in this 
dissent.</p>
<p><em>Decision reversed.</em></p></div>
