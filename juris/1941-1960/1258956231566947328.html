				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Rizal, Hon. Nicasio Yatco, presiding, declaring&nbsp; a contract of&nbsp; lease&nbsp; rescinded and cancelled,&nbsp; ordering the&nbsp; lessee-appellant&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; back rental amounting&nbsp; to&nbsp; P7,710, with 12% interest annually from&nbsp; February 10, 1953 until fully paid,&nbsp; and&nbsp; liquidated&nbsp; damages of P2,000,&nbsp; and to deliver&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease,&nbsp; together with the improvements thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appeal was made directly&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; as&nbsp; only questions of law&nbsp; are raised on the&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>It appears that on&nbsp; September 20, 1952 plaintiff leased two&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of land containing an aggregate&nbsp; area of 4,028 square meters in San Juan,&nbsp; Rizal to the defendant.&nbsp; The purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease was&nbsp; to&nbsp; enable&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; to construct a building thereon of strong materials in which the lessee was to maintain and operate a "cabaret".&nbsp; The contract expressly&nbsp; provides that it shall&nbsp; take&nbsp; effect on January 1,&nbsp; 1953 and terminate in fifteen years, with an extension of the period of lease&nbsp; by five years&nbsp; if agreed upon by the&nbsp; parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lessee bound&nbsp; himself to pay a monthly rental of&nbsp; P300.00,&nbsp; payable in&nbsp; advance within the first five days&nbsp; of each&nbsp; month, to insure the building after its construction for P40,000.00 and, if the building is destroyed within five years, to&nbsp; construct another building with the proceeds of the insurance policy; if destroyed between the fifth and eleventh year,&nbsp; the proceeds of the policy shall be divided&nbsp; equally between them; and if destroyed after&nbsp; the tenth year the lessor shall receive the full amount of the&nbsp; proceeds of the policy to the exclusion of the lessee.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; further agreed that in the maintenance&nbsp; and&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the cabaret&nbsp; the lessee&nbsp; shall observe and comply with all regulations; that the lessor shall have the right to&nbsp; hire and dismiss minor employees; that the lessee&nbsp; shall&nbsp; pay all&nbsp; the&nbsp; taxes and&nbsp; services and that upon termination of the lease because of the expiration of the term or for any other causes, the lessor shall become the absolute owner of the&nbsp; building erected with all the improvements (R. A. Nos. 16-17,)&nbsp; etc.<br><br>The Court found that at the time&nbsp; of the filing of the action on September 13,1954 lessee had paid only Pl,000.00 and had also failed&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; taxes due&nbsp; on the land and the building&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; was&nbsp; forced&nbsp; to pay P303.70 therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant failed to appear at the hearing&nbsp; although&nbsp; he had filed an answer in which he alleged&nbsp; as a special defense that&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties to the lease had intended that the rights and obligations between them could not arise unless the intended operation of the&nbsp; cabaret could materialize.&nbsp;&nbsp; The basis of this special defense is&nbsp; the contract&nbsp; itself,&nbsp; as defendant was&nbsp; not present at the trial to prove such alleged&nbsp; understanding&nbsp; between the lessor and the&nbsp; lessee.<br><br>On this appeal the said issue is again raised&nbsp; by the lessee&nbsp; (1st and&nbsp; 2nd&nbsp; assignments&nbsp; of&nbsp; error).&nbsp; However, this defense cannot&nbsp; excuse him from the&nbsp; payment of rents,&nbsp; for the following reasons:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; the contract expressly contains&nbsp; no clause&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which the said defense could be predicated&nbsp; and, on the other&nbsp; hand, it expressly provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; shall&nbsp; become&nbsp; effective&nbsp; on January 1, 1953;&nbsp; (2) the trial&nbsp; court found that when the&nbsp; lessor demanded&nbsp; payment of rentals, lessee replied asking for an extension for&nbsp; payment and not for the reason claimed by him in his special defense.&nbsp; (Decision,&nbsp; R. 0. A.&nbsp; p. 53; Exhs. "C" and "D", Brief for Appellee, pp. 19-20).&nbsp;&nbsp; These letters of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant indicate that rents are&nbsp; to be paid even if the cabaret could not be made to operate.<br><br>In the third assignment of error, lessee-defendant argues that in sentencing him to pay&nbsp; back rentals and&nbsp; taxes, with 12%&nbsp; interest thereon, to the lessor-plaintiff, as well as in&nbsp; ordering the&nbsp; rescission of the contract, the trial court was enforcing very onerous terms of the contract, in violation of Article 1378 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; The payment of the rentals from January&nbsp; 1, 1953, as expressly agreed upon in the contract, can not&nbsp; be said to be onerous; as&nbsp; lessee-defendant&nbsp;&nbsp; had&nbsp; erected&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; lessor-plaintiff's property,&nbsp; he should pay for the use&nbsp; and occupancy of the leased premises.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither can the payment of interest on the back rentals and taxes by the lessee-defendant be considered unreasonable.&nbsp; The agreement is very clear on this&nbsp; point&nbsp; (par. 11, Contract of Lease,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 19, Record on Appeal.)&nbsp; However, we find that the&nbsp; payment of liquidated damages of P2,000 may be considered onerous.&nbsp; The failure of the common plan to&nbsp; operate&nbsp; the cabaret appears to be a common error both on the part of the lessor-plaintiff and&nbsp; the&nbsp; lessee defendant.&nbsp; We agree that it is&nbsp; onerous to require the payment of liquidated damages when both parties had committed the same error as to the possibility of a business&nbsp; being established.&nbsp;&nbsp; The liquidated damages assessed by the trial court should, therefore, be eliminated.<br><br>The most important portion&nbsp; of the decision, which has attracted&nbsp; attention&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court, is the&nbsp; return of the land and the improvement existing thereon, without payment therefor.&nbsp; The improvement consists of a building worth P80,000.&nbsp; The return is apparently authorized&nbsp; by paragraph 7 of the&nbsp; Contract, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"That at the&nbsp; termination of&nbsp; this lease&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; either because of the expiration of&nbsp; its term&nbsp; or for any other lawful causes, the Lessor shall be the absolute owner&nbsp; of the building described&nbsp; above together with all other improvements&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Lessee may erect on the leased premises, without giving the Lessee any indemnification whatsoever."<br></blockquote>We believe that a literal&nbsp; enforcement of this provision of the contract would be unconscionable.&nbsp; Because of the error attributable&nbsp; both to&nbsp; the lessor as well as the lessee that the plan&nbsp; to operate the cabaret&nbsp; could not materialize,&nbsp; to require&nbsp; the lessee to lose the improvement valued at P 80,000 would be unconscionable, if not&nbsp; iniquitous.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe&nbsp; we must exercise&nbsp; the&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; granted Us&nbsp; by Article 1229 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code, which&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 1229. The judge&nbsp; shall equitably reduce&nbsp; the penalty&nbsp; when the principal&nbsp; obligation has&nbsp; been partly or irregularly&nbsp; complied with by&nbsp; the debtor.&nbsp; Even if there&nbsp; has been no performance, the penalty may also be&nbsp; reduced by the courts if it is&nbsp; iniquitous or unconscionable."<br></blockquote>Instead&nbsp; of enforcing the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; literally, we believe that&nbsp; Article 1678&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp; should,&nbsp; instead,&nbsp; be applied, such that the lessor-plaintiff would pay one-half of the value of the building erected on his land,&nbsp; or&nbsp; if&nbsp; he refuses&nbsp; to make such&nbsp; payment, that&nbsp; the lessee-defendant be&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; to&nbsp; remove the improvements that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had erected&nbsp; at his&nbsp; own&nbsp; expense.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations, the&nbsp; decision appealed from should be modified to read as follows: (1)&nbsp; that the contract of lease be rescinded&nbsp; for failure of the lessee-defendant&nbsp; to pay the agreed rentals&nbsp; within a reasonable time and&nbsp; the lessee-defendant&nbsp; be ordered&nbsp; to&nbsp; return the leased premises; (2) that the lessee-defendant be ordered to pay to the lessor-plaintiff back rentals from January 1, 1953 to the date of the removal&nbsp; of the building or&nbsp; to the time lessor-defendant manifests his intention to keep the building,&nbsp; with&nbsp; interest at the&nbsp; rate of&nbsp; 12%&nbsp; yearly&nbsp; for every year of delinquency; (3) that the lessee-defendant shall pay to the lessor-plaintiff the amount of taxes&nbsp; advanced by the plaintiff, or the sum of P303.70, with 12% interest yearly&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date of payment; (4) that&nbsp; the lessor-plaintiff be required to pay one-half of the value of the building, which&nbsp; is&nbsp; P40,000, to the lessee-defendant, in case he should elect to keep the building erected on his land, and in case of his refusal to pay the said amount to the lessee-defendant, that the latter&nbsp; should&nbsp; have&nbsp; the authority to remove the construction within a reasonable period of&nbsp; time and at his own expense;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; that the sum of Pl,000.00 paid by lessee-defendant be deducted from the&nbsp; rentals fixed in&nbsp; par. (2) hereof.&nbsp; No costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcio</i>n and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
