				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by certiorari against a final order of dismissal by the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial Relations of its cases Nos. 598-V and 598-V(l) to 598-V(16) based on a compromise agreement, copy of which&nbsp; is attached to the&nbsp; answer&nbsp; of respondent Premier Productions,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; executed by and between the&nbsp; said Corporation and the Philippine&nbsp; Movie Pictures Association, whereby the parties agreed:&nbsp; (1) that the Corporation shall pay to the Union P200,000 in settlement of the claims that the Union or its employees may have&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; Premier&nbsp; Productions,&nbsp; Inc.;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that the Corporation leases to the&nbsp; Union&nbsp; its equipment and facilities&nbsp; to&nbsp; enable the&nbsp; Union&nbsp; to produce&nbsp; and process two&nbsp; moving&nbsp; pictures;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that in&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of the above, all pending petitions and&nbsp; cases&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Union in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations&nbsp; against&nbsp; the Corporation and its officers arising out of a labor dispute, particularly cases Nos. 598-V, 598-V(l), 59&amp;-V(3), 598V('4), 598-V(6), 598-V(8), 59&amp;-V(10),&nbsp; 598-V(ll), 598V(12), 598-V(15), and 598-V(16), as&nbsp; well as all their pending incidents, be withdrawn and dismissed, including pending executions, levy, attachment,&nbsp; and&nbsp; garnishment of the properties and equipment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Corporation, etc.<br><br>The petitioners in the above-entitled cases are the same in each and everyone of&nbsp; three&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; cases, namely, CIR No.&nbsp; 598-V&nbsp; in which the Union&nbsp; had&nbsp; an overtime claim&nbsp; for approximately&nbsp; P200,000; CIR No.&nbsp; 598-V(3), in which petitioners therein had secured a judgment for reinstatement and for the&nbsp; payment of back wages, which judgment was already in&nbsp; the process of execution; CIR No. 598-V(6), for claims amounting to P100,000 pending trial and resolution.&nbsp; It is claimed by petitioners in these three cases (1) that the Union which took part in the compromise&nbsp; agreement had&nbsp; lost its personality;&nbsp; (2) that the agreement deprives a worker&nbsp; claiming&nbsp; for&nbsp; unpaid overtime work performed of the payment of&nbsp; the same against his will;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that the agreement is illegal insofar as it reduced&nbsp; the fees of their attorneys previously determined by the same court upon&nbsp; a final judgment,&nbsp; against the attorneys' will.<br><br>The case between&nbsp; the Premier&nbsp; Productions, Inc. and the Philippine Movie Pictures&nbsp; Workers Association had come to us on three occasions, namely, in cases G. R. Nos. 92 Phil. 843;&nbsp; L-7338, 97 Phil. 178; and&nbsp; L-8048, June&nbsp; 30, 1955.&nbsp; In the decisions rendered by us in the first two of&nbsp; the above cases,&nbsp; we&nbsp; had ordered the reinstatement of&nbsp; the workers&nbsp; to their&nbsp; former positions&nbsp; in the Corporation,&nbsp; and in&nbsp; the third one, aside&nbsp; from&nbsp; a decision ordering&nbsp; the reinstatement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the workers and&nbsp; the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; their back&nbsp; wages, execution&nbsp; had&nbsp;&nbsp; issued. It will be seen,&nbsp; however, that the compromise agreement covers not&nbsp; only&nbsp; cases pending trial or&nbsp; appeal but also cases in which orders of execution&nbsp; had been issued, and the question&nbsp; that is&nbsp; posed before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court is whether at&nbsp; any stage of&nbsp; the proceedings,&nbsp; especially in the last instance,&nbsp; compromise may still&nbsp; be&nbsp; agreed upon&nbsp; by and between the parties.<br><br>The settlement&nbsp; of cases&nbsp; in&nbsp; court is&nbsp; authorized and even&nbsp; encouraged&nbsp; by&nbsp; express&nbsp; provision&nbsp; of law (Articles 2028 and 2029, Civil Code; Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines <i>vs.</i> Villarosa,&nbsp; 103 Phil., 631; 54 Off. Gaz., [24] 6249.&nbsp; The law does not limit compromises to cases about to be filed or cases already&nbsp; pending in courts.&nbsp; That a&nbsp; compromise may be&nbsp; effected&nbsp; even&nbsp; after final judgment is impliedly authorized by Article 2040 (Civil Code).&nbsp; The policy of the law contained in the above provisions is also adopted in Section 27 of the Industrial Peace Act which expressly orders&nbsp; "that the Judges&nbsp; of the Court shall&nbsp; call&nbsp; both parties&nbsp; to the&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; and make every attempt to&nbsp; help them reach&nbsp; a just and&nbsp; speedy solution by mutual&nbsp; agreement."<br><br>It is to be noted that there appears to be no limitation on&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to compromise, such as&nbsp; the&nbsp; one claimed by&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; to exist&nbsp; (that&nbsp; there was already a&nbsp; final executory judgment in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners).&nbsp; We can&nbsp; see&nbsp; no&nbsp; reason for&nbsp; limiting the right of&nbsp; compromise to pending&nbsp; cases, excluding therefrom&nbsp; those&nbsp; already in the process&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution.&nbsp; And when, as in this case, no less&nbsp; than seventeen cases had been filed and were pending between the parties, in&nbsp; different&nbsp; stages of hearing or execution before&nbsp; the court, a compromise of all of them, whether pending or&nbsp; executory,&nbsp; was most practical and convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, as the cases&nbsp; are related&nbsp; with&nbsp; each other, it cannot&nbsp; be claimed that that which&nbsp; had already reached the stage of execution should be taken away&nbsp; from the field of compromise. We, therefore, find no legitimate objection to the compromise as entered into, embracing all the&nbsp; seventeen cases pending between the parties even if some of the members of the Union were personally prejudiced&nbsp; by&nbsp; such&nbsp; a compromise agreement.&nbsp; The&nbsp; nature of a compromise agreement is such that&nbsp; a party must give up some of&nbsp; the rights that he has,&nbsp; in consideration of the same act on the part of the other side.<br><br>The second argument made on behalf of the petitioners is that the Union had already lost its personality because it has failed to comply with the requirements of Republic Act No. 557.&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer it must be stated that the&nbsp; cases were filed by the Union at a time when it still had legal existence.&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; have not&nbsp; shown&nbsp; any&nbsp; reason or ground for&nbsp; their&nbsp; contention that the Union has&nbsp; ceased to have&nbsp; a legal personality because it failed&nbsp; to comply with the&nbsp; provisions of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no evidence in the record&nbsp; of any act&nbsp; or fact which&nbsp; may have&nbsp; operated to deprive the&nbsp; Union of&nbsp; the&nbsp; legal&nbsp; personality&nbsp; that it had at the time it&nbsp; instituted the&nbsp; action. Besides, if the Union had a personality at the&nbsp; time when it brought&nbsp; the cases&nbsp; in court, it is presumed to have continued to have that personality, there being no evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; Furthermore, it would&nbsp; be unjust and unfair to declare the compromise null&nbsp; and void&nbsp; simply because a new law has taken effect which has changed the legal&nbsp; requirements for labor unions to exist.&nbsp; If the Union had a personality at the time it brought the action and during the pendency of the action,&nbsp; the&nbsp; change&nbsp; in the law&nbsp; which may have&nbsp; required&nbsp; the Union to comply with other regulations in order to establish a personality under the new law would&nbsp; not render the acts&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said Union&nbsp; in the pending cases in which it&nbsp; is a party null and&nbsp; void.<br><br>The last&nbsp; objection to the agreement was the&nbsp; fact that the rights of&nbsp; the&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; which represented&nbsp; the Union had previously been&nbsp; determined&nbsp; in the final&nbsp; judgment. The rights&nbsp; of lawyers to&nbsp; the fees due them for services in&nbsp; a&nbsp; litigation cannot have a higher standing&nbsp; than the rights of the&nbsp; clients or the parties themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawyers* rights may not be invoked&nbsp; by&nbsp; some of the parties&nbsp; as&nbsp; a ground for&nbsp; disapproving&nbsp; the compromise. The&nbsp; lawyer affected&nbsp; can enforce his rights in a proper proceeding in accordance&nbsp; with the Rules, but said&nbsp; rights may&nbsp; not be used to prevent the approval of the compromise.<br><br>Lastly, the parties in the cases which were the&nbsp; subject of&nbsp; the compromise agreement were the Premier Productions,&nbsp; Inc. and the Union.&nbsp; The petitioners in&nbsp; these cases are merely&nbsp; members of the Union and are bound by the actions of the Union, that&nbsp; is to say, a&nbsp; majority of the members of the Union.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; petitioners feel&nbsp; that they have been&nbsp; deprived&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; personal&nbsp; rights&nbsp; under&nbsp; the judgment that they&nbsp; have obtained, which judgments had become executory, because the&nbsp; sums&nbsp; to which they&nbsp; are entitled&nbsp; under&nbsp; the judgments object&nbsp; of the compromise had been reduced, the remedy does not&nbsp; lie in questioning the&nbsp; validity of the&nbsp; compromise&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; but in compelling the&nbsp; Union&nbsp; of which they&nbsp; are&nbsp; members to&nbsp; give them a&nbsp; share in the proceeds of the compromise&nbsp; agreement equal or equivalent to that recognized&nbsp; in&nbsp; the judgments.<br><br>Premises&nbsp; considered, we&nbsp; find&nbsp; that there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; merit in the petitions&nbsp; in the above-entitled cases and the same are&nbsp; hereby dismissed, with costs against petitioners.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
