				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A civil complaint was filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila by the appellant, alleging that the appellees, her former employers&nbsp; wrote her a libelous letter of separation,&nbsp; a copy of which was posted in&nbsp; the company's bulletin&nbsp; board, and praying that judgment be&nbsp; rendered sentencing the appellees to&nbsp; pay to the appellant damages in the amount of P50,000 with&nbsp; interest and&nbsp; "to&nbsp; retract the contents of the&nbsp; letter of separation" and "to&nbsp; give said retraction&nbsp; due and&nbsp; requisite publicity."&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; appellees' motion, the&nbsp; complaint was&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground of prescription.&nbsp; Her motion for reconsideration having been denied, the appellant&nbsp; has&nbsp; interposed the present appeal. <br>&nbsp;<br>As the appellant admits&nbsp; that the complaint&nbsp; was filed one&nbsp; year and six&nbsp; months&nbsp; after&nbsp; the publication&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Iibelous letter&nbsp; on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 18, 1954,&nbsp; we are only to determine what is the&nbsp; prescriptive period of&nbsp; a civil&nbsp; action arising, according to&nbsp; her, from libel covered by Articles 353, 355&nbsp; and&nbsp; 360&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 1161&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; provides that civil&nbsp; obligations resulting from criminal offenses shall be governed&nbsp; by the penal laws, subject to the provisions of Article 2177 and of the pertinent provisions of&nbsp; Chapter&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; Preliminary Title, on Human Relations, and of Title&nbsp; XVII of said Code, regulating&nbsp; damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; A perusal of the rules restricting the application&nbsp; of the&nbsp; penal laws,&nbsp; reveals that there is&nbsp; no provision about the question involved in the instant case. <br>&nbsp;<br>Concerning extinguishment of obligations arising from felonies,&nbsp; Article 112 of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code provides that "civil liability, established in Articles&nbsp; 100,&nbsp; 101,&nbsp; 102 and&nbsp; 103&nbsp; of this Code shall&nbsp; be extinguished in the same manner as other obligations&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of&nbsp; the Civil Law."&nbsp; Upon the other hand,&nbsp; Article 1231 of the Civil&nbsp; Code is&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect that "*&nbsp; * * other causes of extinguishment&nbsp; of obligations, such as&nbsp; annulment, rescission, fulfillment of a resolutory&nbsp; condition, and prescription, are governed elsewhere in this Code."&nbsp; On the matter&nbsp; of prescription,&nbsp; the applicable provision&nbsp; is&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1129 of the Civil Code which states that "actions prescribe by&nbsp; mere lapse of&nbsp; time&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; by&nbsp; law."&nbsp;&nbsp; This necessarily leads us to Article 1147 of the Civil Code which requires that an action for defamation must be filed within one year.&nbsp; The broad&nbsp; term "defamation" in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of any&nbsp; other specific provisions,&nbsp; includes libel. <br>&nbsp;<br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed With costs against the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br>&nbsp;<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L.,&nbsp; Endencia,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br></div>
