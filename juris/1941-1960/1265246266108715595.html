				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; from&nbsp; a judgment holding that the title of the plaintiff&nbsp; to the parcel&nbsp; of land in litigation is valid and binding as against the whole world, and that as the defendants&nbsp; have no right whatsoever to the parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land, they are ordered to vacate it, and to pay to&nbsp; the plaintiff damages at the&nbsp; rate of P40,000 a year from 25 March 1949&nbsp; until possession&nbsp; be&nbsp; restored to it, and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; receiver is, directed to restore to the plaintiff the possession&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land under receivership and to deliver the income or rentals received in any&nbsp; form&nbsp; during the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; receivership of the parcel of land after proper deductions.<p>The plaintiff,&nbsp; a domestic&nbsp; corporation, asserts ownership and title to a parcel of land described&nbsp; in the&nbsp; third paragraph&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint, as evidenced&nbsp; by&nbsp; transfer certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title No. 119&nbsp; (37679)&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in its .name by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Registrar of Deeds&nbsp; in and&nbsp; for the&nbsp; province of Rizal, which&nbsp; comprises the&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land described in the fourth paragraph thereof, and the defendants having taken possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; smaller parcel&nbsp; of land without any right so to do, the plaintiff brought&nbsp; this&nbsp; action to recover possession thereof,&nbsp; and prayed that the defendants be&nbsp; ordered to vacate it and&nbsp; to desis from asserting any right to the parcel of land or any part thereof and to pay jointly and&nbsp; severally to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; the sum of 10,000&nbsp; as damages; and that the buildings&nbsp; constructed thereon&nbsp; claimed by the defendants be demolished and removed at their&nbsp; expense;&nbsp; and for such further and&nbsp; other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.</p><p>In their fourth&nbsp; amended&nbsp; answer&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants deny the allegations in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the complaint and allege that the parcel of land&nbsp; occupied&nbsp; by them, of which they claim to be the&nbsp; owners, contains&nbsp; 46 hectares more or less,&nbsp; and has been&nbsp; continuously and&nbsp; uninterruptedly&nbsp; in, their&nbsp; possession and of&nbsp; their predecessors-in-interest for a period of over 100 years under and by virtue of&nbsp; a&nbsp; <em>titulo de information posesoria</em> duly&nbsp; issued by the Spanish Government;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; parcel of land belonging to them must have been included in the&nbsp; transfer certificate of title of the plaintiff&nbsp; erroneously, maliciously illegally, by false and fraudulent representations and without their knowledge&nbsp; or of their&nbsp; predeeessors-in-interest; that they learned for the first time that the parcel of&nbsp; land had&nbsp; been included in&nbsp; the&nbsp; tract of land registered in the name&nbsp; of the plaintiff when this action was brought in March&nbsp; 1949 and in the following month when the plaintiff forcibly&nbsp; entered upon&nbsp; the parcel of land&nbsp; by means of bulldozers&nbsp; and other grading implements; that after the issuance of original certificate of title&nbsp; No. 735 the parcel of land has not been conveyed or transferred to&nbsp; innocent third persons; that upon&nbsp; learning of the fact that their parcel of land had been&nbsp; included&nbsp; in&nbsp; the tract&nbsp; of&nbsp; land registered&nbsp; in the name of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; they demanded from the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; the&nbsp; cancellation&nbsp; of transfer certificate title Nor&nbsp; 119&nbsp; (37679) and asked&nbsp; for the reconveyance of the parcel of&nbsp; land but the plaintiff ignored their demand;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; fraudulent and illegal&nbsp; registration by the plaintiff of the parcel of land&nbsp; belonging to&nbsp; them in G.L.R.O.&nbsp; Rec. No.&nbsp; 7681&nbsp; has&nbsp; caused&nbsp;&nbsp; them&nbsp; damage in the sum of&nbsp; P6,900,000.&nbsp; As affirmative defense&nbsp; they allege&nbsp; that&nbsp; the plaintiff has no&nbsp; legal capacity to&nbsp; sue.&nbsp;&nbsp; By way&nbsp; of counterclaim&nbsp; they ask for P10,000&nbsp; as damages caused by&nbsp; the filing of this unnecessary,&nbsp; unjustified&nbsp; and malicious complaint; P20,000 for the destruction of lands, trees, rice&nbsp; paddies&nbsp; and ridges&nbsp; owned by the defendants; P10,000 for&nbsp; the&nbsp; annual loss of&nbsp; crops due&nbsp; to such&nbsp; destruction; P6,900,000 for&nbsp; the&nbsp; value of the&nbsp; land at&nbsp; the rate&nbsp; of P15&nbsp; per square meter&nbsp; in&nbsp; the event that&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; be rendered against them;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration of title secured by the&nbsp; plaintiff which includes&nbsp; 46&nbsp; hectares&nbsp; of land claimed by&nbsp; them be&nbsp; deemed a trust;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the plaintiff be&nbsp; required&nbsp; to&nbsp; reconvey the parcel of land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the foregoing, they pray that the complaint be dismissed; that they be declared the absolute owners of 46 hectares of land described&nbsp; in paragraph 4&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint, ordering&nbsp; the plaintiff to execute a deed of reconveyance of the parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land in their favor, to pay them the sum of P40,000 or the sum of P6,900,000 for the value of the land, P10,000 for attorney's fees and double costs, and the Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of&nbsp; Rizal to&nbsp; cancel&nbsp; transfer&nbsp; certificate of title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 119 (37679) issued in the name of the plaintiff.</p><p>The&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; reply&nbsp; to the&nbsp; defendant's counterclaim admits&nbsp; that in April 1949 it bulldozed parts of the land involved&nbsp; in the litigation the possession&nbsp; of which had been restored to it&nbsp; by its tenants and were not in possession&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendants; that&nbsp; the damages the&nbsp; latter claim to have suffered, as alleged in paragraph 3 of their counterclaim,&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; recovered because they&nbsp; are&nbsp; not entitled to the&nbsp; crops of the&nbsp; parcel of land in&nbsp; litigation, the&nbsp; same being owned by it (the plaintiff) ; and denies the rest of the allegations of the counterclaim.&nbsp; By way of affirmative defense, it alleges&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is an&nbsp; innocent purchaser for value, it having bought in&nbsp; 1938 the tract of land in which the litigated parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; lies from the Heirs of D. Tuazon, Inc.; that an action for damages and reconveyance to the defendants of the parcel of land had long prescribed, the&nbsp; tract of land having&nbsp; been registered&nbsp; in the name of its predecessors-in-interest on&nbsp; 8 July 1914, as evidenced&nbsp; by&nbsp; original&nbsp; certificate of title No.&nbsp; 735 issued by the Registrar of Deeds&nbsp; in and for the province of Rizal.</p><p>By agreement of&nbsp; the parties,&nbsp; the area of land in possession&nbsp; of the defendants&nbsp; is delimited in the plan marked Exhibit B by broken&nbsp; lines in red ink.&nbsp; There is no dispute as to the fact that the&nbsp; parcel of land occupied and claimed by the defendants is comprised within the tract of&nbsp; land as delimited&nbsp; and described in transfer&nbsp; certificate of title&nbsp; No. 119&nbsp; (37679)&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Registrar of Deeds in and for the province of Rizal (Exhibit C), and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; title&nbsp; of plaintif's predecessors-in-interest to the&nbsp; tract of&nbsp; land within which the litigated parcel of land is comprised was confirmed by&nbsp; the Land Registration&nbsp; Court&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; decree was entered&nbsp; on&nbsp; 8&nbsp; July 1914, as evidenced by the issuance of&nbsp; original certificate of title No. 735, pursuant to decree No. 17431&nbsp; issued in G. L. R. 0. Rec. No. 7681.&nbsp; Transfer certificate of title No. 119&nbsp; (37679) is&nbsp; a transfer from transfer certificate of title No. 35073 (Exhibit C).&nbsp; Previous&nbsp; certificates&nbsp; were transfer certificates of title Nos. 34853&nbsp; and 31997&nbsp; (Exhibits J and I).</p><p>The preponderance of evidence shows&nbsp; that Isaias&nbsp; Santiago, who together with his brother and&nbsp; sister claimed to have&nbsp; inherited the parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; in litigation&nbsp; from Inocencio Santiago and&nbsp; the latter from&nbsp; Baldomero&nbsp; Santiago, worked&nbsp; and cultivated part of the&nbsp; parcel of&nbsp; land in dispute from 1915 to 1918 as&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; of Augusto&nbsp; Tuason.&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1930&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1932 Isaias&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; together&nbsp; with his children, the herein defendants,&nbsp; worked part of the parcel of land as tenant of Trinidad&nbsp; Icasiano&nbsp; who had leased it from the Tuasons.&nbsp; After&nbsp; Isaias Santiago and his children ceased to be tenants of Icasiano,&nbsp; Petronilo Paguia succeeded them as tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Icasiano ceased to be a tenant of&nbsp; the Tuasons,&nbsp; Isaias Santiago and his children worked and cultivated another part of the parcel of land leased by Epifanio de la Cruz from the&nbsp; Tuasons.&nbsp; The part leased by Epifanio&nbsp; de la&nbsp; Cruz adjoined another part of&nbsp; the parcel of land containing an&nbsp; area of 20 hectares leased in 1934 by Ambrosio Pablo from the Bank of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; then&nbsp; administering the tract of land for the Tuasons.&nbsp; Isaias Santiago was one of the six&nbsp; tenants of Ambrosio Pablo from 1934&nbsp; until the Japanese occupation when Isaias Santiago, encouraged and aided by&nbsp; Gaudencio Bautista,&nbsp; a&nbsp; member&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Ganap Party, claimed&nbsp; the parcel of land as his and made&nbsp; it so difficult for Gavino Pablo,&nbsp; who&nbsp; was managing the&nbsp; part of the parcel of land leased&nbsp; by&nbsp; his&nbsp; brother&nbsp; Ambrosio, to stay in it and for that reason abandoned it.</p><p>The evidence for&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; imputes&nbsp; to Demetrio Tuason,&nbsp; Auguato&nbsp; Tuason;&nbsp; Mariano Tuason&nbsp; and&nbsp; Juan Tuason, four of the predecessors-in-interest of the plaintiff who had&nbsp; applied and secured the registration of title to the tract of land delimited and&nbsp; described in&nbsp; Exhibit C, and who are&nbsp; now dead, certain statements acknowledging that Isaias Santiago&nbsp; was claiming ownership and was in possession of the parcel of land in litigation, and that being a bully (maton) of&nbsp; violent temper, said Isaias Santiago made it&nbsp; dangerous for anyone to go into, work and cultivate any part of the parcel of land under a lease contract from or permission of the Tuasons.&nbsp; Such evidence, aside from being of the weakest character because it can no longer be contradicted or denied by the deceased,&nbsp; is not&nbsp; an acknowledgment of the title of&nbsp; Isaias Santiago&nbsp; to the parcel of land but only an admission of such claim of ownership which cannot, however, derogate&nbsp; the&nbsp; title of the registered owner.&nbsp; Prescription and adverse possession of a registered land cannot divest the registered owner of his title there of. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; It cannot be believed or it is hard to believe that the registered owners of a parcel of land would&nbsp; admit title of another to the same when they&nbsp; knew that they had the title thereto.&nbsp; The testimony of Vicente&nbsp; del Rosario and Albina Santiago only shows&nbsp; that the appellants' claim and that of&nbsp; their predecessors-in-interest and their&nbsp; possession of the parcel&nbsp; of land were tolerated by the registered owner and its predecessors-in-interest.</p><p>The&nbsp; appellants cannot successfully assail the decree of registration entered on 8 July 1914, because it was&nbsp; the result of&nbsp; proceedings<em> in&nbsp; rem</em> (G.L.R.O.&nbsp; Rec.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 7681) and the reopening&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; on the ground of fraud may only be had with one year&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of the decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></p><p>The action&nbsp; allowed to be brought by .section 55, Act No.&nbsp; 469, as amended by&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 3322,&nbsp; cannot be invoked and availed of&nbsp; because fraud has not been proved. Section&nbsp; 32, Act No.&nbsp; 496,&nbsp; provides: "The certificate&nbsp; of the clerk that he has served the&nbsp; notice as directed by the court, by publishing or mailing, shall&nbsp; be filed in the case before the return day, and shall be conclusive&nbsp; proof of such&nbsp; service." The&nbsp; testimony of Geronimo&nbsp; Santiago to the effect that he&nbsp; was not notified of the application for the registration of the parcel of land by the predecessors-in-interest&nbsp; of the appellee&nbsp; who had applied for&nbsp; such registration cannot&nbsp; prevail over the presumption of regularity of the proceedings in the land registration case,&nbsp; not only because&nbsp; the&nbsp; return&nbsp; of&nbsp; the clerk&nbsp; of court is&nbsp; conclusive proof&nbsp; of such&nbsp; service&nbsp; but also&nbsp; because&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that Geronimo&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; was not notified of the&nbsp; application for the registration of the parcel of land by the predecessors-in-interest of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; who had applied&nbsp; for such&nbsp; registration does not&nbsp; mean and imply that his father Isaias Santiago who was still living at the time&nbsp; of the registration proceedings was not notified thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any&nbsp; event, the&nbsp; decree&nbsp; "shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; conclusive&nbsp; upon&nbsp; and against all persons, including the Insular Government and all branches thereof, whether&nbsp; mentioned by name in the application, notice, or citation, or included in the general description.&nbsp; "To All&nbsp; Whom It&nbsp; May Concern."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p>Geronimo Santiago and his aunt Albina Santiago&nbsp; claim and testify that they had <em>a titulo de informaddn posesoria</em> which Isaias Santiago left, together with the land tax receipts evidencing payments by him of tax on the parcel of land from 1903 to 1939,&nbsp; in the hands of Attorney Ananias Galimba&nbsp; for the purpose of applying for registration&nbsp; of the parcel of land&nbsp; claimed by&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The documentary evidence&nbsp; on payment of&nbsp; taxes shows that Isaias Santiago paid&nbsp; only for&nbsp; 1941,&nbsp; 1942, 1943,&nbsp; 1945 and&nbsp; 1946 for a parcel of land in Diliman, assessed&nbsp; at P18,860,&nbsp; Assessment No. 1288 (Exhibits 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, 2-D,&nbsp; 2-E,&nbsp; 2-F and 2-G).&nbsp;&nbsp; The alleged receipts evidencing tax&nbsp; payments on&nbsp; the&nbsp; parcel of&nbsp; land which Geronimo Santiago claims were turned over by his father Isaias&nbsp; to Attorney Ananias Galimba together&nbsp; with the alleged titulo de information posesoria cannot be true,&nbsp; because in the&nbsp; declaration of real property for&nbsp; assessment&nbsp; purposes on&nbsp; the same&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land which Isaias Santiago&nbsp; claimed to be&nbsp; his and for which&nbsp; he paid land&nbsp; taxes from 1941 to 1.946 except 1944, subscribed and&nbsp; sworn to by him on&nbsp; 25 September 1940, the following appears: "Duplicate of&nbsp; the land under tax No. 988 in the name of J. M. Tuason, Inc."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibits 3 and 4).&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears also in Exhibit 3 that it is a new declaration.&nbsp; So all the&nbsp; testimony of Geronimo Santiago regarding&nbsp; land tax receipts from&nbsp; 1903&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1939 and the reason&nbsp; given why his father Isaias&nbsp; had&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare the parcel of&nbsp; land for assessment purposes as new,&nbsp; which, according&nbsp; to him, was due to the transfer of the parcel of land from the province of Rizal to Quezon City, cannot be true.</p><p>The appellants&nbsp; &amp;lso claim&nbsp; that they had&nbsp; a<em> titulo de information posesoria</em> which,&nbsp; together with the land tax receipts from 1903 to 1939, was turned over to Attorney Ananias Galimba for the&nbsp; purpose of applying&nbsp; for the registration of the parcel of land; that unfortunately Attorney&nbsp; Ananias Galimba had to&nbsp; abandon&nbsp; his&nbsp; house because he was hunted&nbsp; by the Japanese on&nbsp; account of his guerrilla activities and&nbsp; the document and the land tax receipts were left in&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; which&nbsp; was&nbsp; burned and razed to the ground&nbsp; sometime in February 1945.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court correctly found that the existence of the tituio de&nbsp; information posesoria&nbsp; has not been established&nbsp; sufficiently and that even if such&nbsp; possessory&nbsp; information title&nbsp; had been in&nbsp; existence&nbsp; it&nbsp; did&nbsp; not vest&nbsp; title&nbsp; of ownership&nbsp; to&nbsp; the parcel of land citing the&nbsp; rule laid down in the&nbsp; case of Modesto&nbsp; <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Leyva,&nbsp; 6 Phil., 186.&nbsp; The&nbsp; wife of Attorney Ananias Galimba testified that the <em>titulo de information posesoria</em> was in the name of Inocencio Santiago, whereas Geronimo Santiago testified that&nbsp; it was in the name of his&nbsp; father Isaias Santiago.</p><p>During the pendency&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; case in this&nbsp; Court, the appellants filed a motion for new trial" alleging that they had&nbsp; discovered&nbsp; among&nbsp; the&nbsp; dossiers&nbsp; in&nbsp; the "Legajo&nbsp; de Terrenos de Varias Provincias"&nbsp; a <em>Composition col el Estado</em>, a&nbsp; true copy of which is marked as Annex C&nbsp; and attached to the motion,&nbsp; issued in favor of Inocencio Santiago, and&nbsp; that aside from the&nbsp; Composiddn&nbsp; con el Estado, the Division of Archives&nbsp; of the National Library found the&nbsp; following documents:&nbsp; one of the&nbsp; "Tribunal Municipal de&nbsp; Caloocan" dated 21&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1894 where the boundaries and&nbsp; area of the "Hacienda&nbsp; de&nbsp; Santa Mesa"' owned by the Tuasons&nbsp; appear (Annex D) ; and another where a petition of the "Procurador de Camara de los del&nbsp; numero&nbsp; de la Real Audiencia,"&nbsp; as&nbsp; representative of the&nbsp; "Procurador&nbsp; del Colegio de&nbsp; Nuestro Padre San Ignacio de Manila;" minutes or certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; a survey and monumenting&nbsp; made&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1708 by&nbsp; the Father Procurator, "Escribano Preceptor," chamber secretary of Capitan Lucas Manzano de Ochoa and attorney-in-fact&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Hacienda of Santa Mesa of Capitan Don Francisco Xavier Monilla and&nbsp; other persons; and&nbsp; the boundary limits of the Hacienda (estate) known as "Mesa de la Santa Misericordia," appear (Annex E).&nbsp; In the&nbsp; last document it appears that one of the boundaries of the Hacienda (estate) known as "Mesa de la Santa Misericordia" was a land known&nbsp; as "Santiago"&nbsp; (Annex E).</p><p>In the document dated 5 May 1848 marked Annex C and attached to the motion for new trial, the "Gobernadorcillo" and the&nbsp; "Juez&nbsp; de Sementeras" of the town of Caloocan and four other signers certified&nbsp; that Inocencio&nbsp; Santiago had prayed&nbsp; for&nbsp; a testimony&nbsp; or&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; on&nbsp; his&nbsp; property located in Santolan containing an area of 16 quinones the boundary limits of which are: on the North, "sementera de&nbsp; la Mesa de la&nbsp; Santa Misericordia y otros;" on&nbsp; the South, a street of the barrio; on the East,&nbsp; Rio San Juan del Monte; and on the West, property&nbsp; of&nbsp; Antonio Tuason, which parcel of&nbsp; land, according to him, he had inherited&nbsp; more&nbsp; than 25&nbsp; years from that date&nbsp; from&nbsp; his deceased father Eligio&nbsp; Santiago;&nbsp; and that it appearing from the statements&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; owners of&nbsp; adjoining lands and others&nbsp; to the effect that&nbsp; their lands were&nbsp; not included&nbsp; in that of Inocencio Santiago,&nbsp; as&nbsp; verified to be true by the "Juez de Sementeras," the "Gobernadorcillo" authorized&nbsp; the&nbsp; formation of the "testimonio?&nbsp; or certificate by publishing it on the bulletin board of the municipal building and&nbsp; in the barrios of the jurisdiction&nbsp; for the information of all,&nbsp; so&nbsp; that upon that information they could&nbsp; file their opposition,&nbsp; if&nbsp; they&nbsp; had any, within six days&nbsp; from that&nbsp; date, after which those who had&nbsp; not filed any&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; would.be prejudiced&nbsp; (bound)&nbsp; thereby. The&nbsp; next paragraph of the&nbsp; document&nbsp; is a&nbsp; "providencia" (order)&nbsp; reciting&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; six days provided for in the&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; paragraph having expired without any person filing any opposition against the&nbsp; application of&nbsp; Inocencio Santiago, and all the requisites and formalities of the&nbsp; law having been&nbsp; complied&nbsp; with, upon recommendation of the "Juez de&nbsp; Sementeras," the "testimonio" or certificate was approved and Inocencio Santiago was declared absolute owner of the land applied for without prejudice&nbsp; to&nbsp; a better right of third&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; the "Gobernadorcillo"&nbsp; signing at the&nbsp; bottom thereof.&nbsp; The document marked Annex D and attached to the motion for&nbsp; new trial contains an order dated 1 June&nbsp; 1894&nbsp; addressed to the 'Capitan&nbsp; Municipal"&nbsp; of the&nbsp; town of&nbsp; Caloocan requiring the mayor of the&nbsp; town to forward to the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; board a&nbsp; detailed&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lands within the jurisdiction of Caloocan, their location, boundaries&nbsp; and&nbsp; area; the compliance therewith&nbsp; on&nbsp; 27 July 1894 by the municipal mayor of&nbsp; Caloocan; and the statement of the area and boundaries of the 'Hacienda de Santa Mesa" owned&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Tuason.&nbsp; The document marked Annex E and attached to the motion is an old document bearing&nbsp; the seal of the years 1796 and&nbsp; 1797 where&nbsp; it appears that a petition was filed by Nicolas Guerrero, who had sufficient&nbsp; power of&nbsp; attorney from Rev. Fr. Joaquin Sanchez, Procurator of the College pf&nbsp; Our Father&nbsp; Saint Ignatius, stating or alleging that&nbsp; as the "Estancia" (estate) of Capitan Juan de Moron mentioned as adjoining land the one then in possession of the "Mesa de la Santa Misericordia," said Procurator together with the&nbsp; "Escribano Preceptor,"&nbsp; chamber&nbsp; secretary&nbsp; of Capitan&nbsp; Lucas Manzano de Ochoa and attorney-in-fact of said&nbsp; "Santa Mesa de Capitan&nbsp; Don&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; Xavier&nbsp; Monilla"&nbsp; and several&nbsp; others went around the boundaries and staked monuments&nbsp; between the "Estancia" (estate) of said Capitan Juan de Moron and the adjoining lands and reached a&nbsp; boundary point&nbsp; called "Sargento" between&nbsp; said&nbsp; "Estancia"&nbsp; of Capitan Juan de Moron and that of the College of Our Father&nbsp; Saint Ignatius, where a monument was placed, and from that point Southwest and North-northwest&nbsp; they reached&nbsp; a "paso" called "2&nbsp; Calang," meaning broken stone (<em>piedra partida</em>) that led to a road going to the "Estancia" of Escobar,&nbsp; also called&nbsp; Balara,&nbsp; owned by the said&nbsp; College of Our Father Saint Ignatius; thence to a point adjoining a land called Santiago, and thence following a North-northwest direction to the river&nbsp; called San Francisco del Monte, where there was a trail called&nbsp; Maypajo, and was&nbsp; the end of said "Estancia" of Capitan Juan de&nbsp; Moron; and praying that&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony of&nbsp; said survey by monuments and boundaries be made&nbsp; of&nbsp; record. The next paragraph entitled "Auto" states "In the&nbsp; city of Manila, on 30 March 1708, before the&nbsp; President and 'Oidores' of the&nbsp; 'Audiencia' and Royal Chancellory of the Philippines,&nbsp; who were&nbsp; holding&nbsp; public hearing from&nbsp; their royal seats, the previous petition was filed and after hearing said officers&nbsp; directed: Let the party of the 'Mesa&nbsp; de la Santa Misericordia be&nbsp; cited to&nbsp; appear.&nbsp; The Clerk of the Chamber."</p><p>The&nbsp; documents just described&nbsp; are not and do&nbsp; not constitute a titulo de information posesoria, because&nbsp; they are merely a&nbsp; certification of possession of the&nbsp; applicant Inocencio&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; and although&nbsp; the&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; states&nbsp; that it declared Inocencio Santiago the owner of the land which was the subject matter thereof, it was still without prejudice&nbsp; to a third party&nbsp; or parties&nbsp; having&nbsp; or&nbsp; holding&nbsp; a better&nbsp; right.&nbsp; It was a&nbsp; step to&nbsp; be taken preparatory or leading to an application for the grant of a title&nbsp; to lands of the public domain (baldios y realengos)&nbsp; by the Spanish Government under the Royal and Government Decrees or laws then&nbsp; in force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be&nbsp; an information posesoria, because the proceedings&nbsp; leading to the grant of title was authorized only by the Royal Decree of 13 February 1894, known&nbsp; as the Maura&nbsp; Law, superseding the provisions of the Royal Decree of 25&nbsp; June&nbsp; 1880&nbsp; which had&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; the issuance of Composition&nbsp; con el Estado&nbsp; titles by the "Direccion General de Administracion Civil" after compliance with the requirements of the&nbsp; Royal Decree.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Annex C of the motion for new trial incorrectly referred to and called&nbsp; in the motion for new trial as a Composicion con el Estado title is not&nbsp; yet a Composicion con&nbsp; el Estado&nbsp; title.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Composicion con el Estado&nbsp; title was that granted by the Spanish Government through&nbsp; the "Bireceion&nbsp; General de Administracion&nbsp; Civil,"&nbsp; pursuant to the&nbsp; provisions of the Royal&nbsp; Decree of 25 June 1880; that granted by the Chief of the Province by delegation&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to the provisions of Royal Decree of 31 August 1888; and that granted&nbsp; also under the Royal Decree of 13 February 1894, because aside from the possessory information proceedings leading to the grant&nbsp; of title&nbsp; to the crown lands (<em>baldios y&nbsp; realengos</em>), the grant by Composicion con el Estado proceedings was still permitted&nbsp; under the provisions of the last royal decree.</p><p>There was also an informacidn posesoria proceedings&nbsp; under the&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; the Mortgage Law which&nbsp; was&nbsp; made effective and&nbsp; in&nbsp; force in the Philippines on 1 December 1889 for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; allowing those who had&nbsp; claim to lands&nbsp; to have their possession recorded&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Registry of Deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; But such recorded possessory&nbsp; information proceedings did not ripen into ownership except under certain conditions, the most important of which was the expiration of 20&nbsp; years after the entry or&nbsp; record in the Registry of Deeds of the&nbsp; possessory&nbsp; information proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; And under article 394 of the Mortgage Law, the entry or record of possession&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Registry of Deeds did&nbsp; not prejudice the owners who held or had a better right&nbsp; to the ownership of the property although his title had not been recorded, unless prescription had&nbsp; confirmed&nbsp; and secured the&nbsp; claim recorded.</p><p>The document&nbsp; marked&nbsp; as Annex E and attached to the motion for new&nbsp; trial is valueless,&nbsp; because&nbsp; while it contains&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; to record a&nbsp; survey&nbsp; by&nbsp; boundaries&nbsp; and the staking of monuments around the "Estancia" of Capitan Juan de Moron in 1708 and an order of the President, the&nbsp; "Oidores" of the "Audiencia"&nbsp; and the Royal Chancellory of&nbsp; the Philippines entered also in 1708, it bears seals of the&nbsp; years 1796 and 1797.&nbsp;&nbsp; The act which was to be certified&nbsp; and made of record&nbsp; took place&nbsp; sometime in 1708, and yet the official paper used wast one for the years 1796 and 1797, or 88 years later.&nbsp; This circumstance&nbsp; renders the documnet unreliable.&nbsp; It may have been done for some purpose but certainly it cannot be given any value. The Northnorthwest course followed by the survey party from the contact point between the&nbsp; "Estancia" of Capitan Juan de Moron and the land known as&nbsp; Santiago, and the fact that the survey party reached a river called&nbsp; or known as San Francisco del Monte, indicate that the land referred to in Annex C was not the one now claimed by the Santiagos.&nbsp; Moreover, laHd known or named "Santiago" does .. not necessarily mean that it was&nbsp; the land&nbsp; owned by Inocencio Santiago or&nbsp; his predecessor-in-interest Eligio Santiago.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it&nbsp; was it would have&nbsp; so stated.&nbsp; For these reasons the motion for new trial, the resolution&nbsp; of which was deferred until the case be&nbsp; decided&nbsp; on the&nbsp; merits, is denied.</p><p>The only remaining point to be decided is the amount of damages..&nbsp; The trial court allows&nbsp; the plaintiff to recover P40,000 a&nbsp; year for&nbsp; damages from&nbsp; 25 March 1949 until possession of the parcel of land is&nbsp; restored to the plaintiff. Damages that are allowable under article 1106 of the Civil Code include the actual losses (<em>dano emergente</em>) which, in this case, are the rentals of the residential part of the parcel of land and the share of the owner in the produce of the agricultural part of the parcel of land, which he failed&nbsp; to collect or receive during the period the usurper was in possession of the parcel of land, and the profits which&nbsp; the owner failed to realize (<em>lucro cesante</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp; What the plaintiff could have&nbsp; realized&nbsp; by laying out&nbsp; streets,&nbsp; filing&nbsp; up low lands,&nbsp; subdividing the parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; incidental expenses, in order to make it suitable for residential purposes, is speculative.&nbsp;&nbsp; To realize those profits would require&nbsp; investment&nbsp; of additional capital. It is, therefore, the actual&nbsp; damages or loss&nbsp; (<em>danos emergent</em>e) that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of its failure to collect or receive&nbsp; the rentals and fruits or produce of the parcel of land and the interest (<em>buero cesante</em>) on the amount of such rentals&nbsp; and share in the agricultural products at the legal rate of&nbsp; interest, to which it is entitled.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court arrived&nbsp; at the amount&nbsp; awarded as&nbsp; damages by allowing 10 per cent annually on the estimated value of the parcel of land.&nbsp; Although this process followed by the trial court in estimating&nbsp; the amount of damages to be awarded is not necessarily unfounded&nbsp; or incorrect,&nbsp; yet&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court overlooked&nbsp; the amount demanded&nbsp; in the&nbsp; prayer of the plaintiff's complaint which is only P10,000. And taking into consideration the fact that the evidence&nbsp; on the amount of&nbsp; recoverable damages is unsatisfactory,&nbsp; to enable the court to make a fair award for damages,&nbsp; and there&nbsp; being no&nbsp; petition by the appellee for&nbsp; leave to amend the prayer of its complaint on the amount of damages&nbsp; so as to&nbsp; make it conform&nbsp; to the evidence, we are of the opinion that the amount demanded in the prayer of the plaintiff's complaint should be awarded&nbsp; for damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; amount of income received or collected in any form by the receiver which will be&nbsp; turned&nbsp; over to the appellee after accounting must be deducted from the amount of the award for&nbsp; damages.</p><p>With&nbsp; the only modification that&nbsp; the amount of damages to be awarded to the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; be as above indicated,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with lawful&nbsp; interest&nbsp; from&nbsp; the .date of&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of the complaint, the rest of the judgment&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against the&nbsp; appellants.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
