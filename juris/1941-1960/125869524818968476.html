				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case concerns the operation of a ferry&nbsp; service by means of&nbsp; motor boats&nbsp; across the&nbsp; Cagayan&nbsp; river, in&nbsp; the province of that name, between the municipality of Aparri on the west bank of that river and the municipality of Calamaniugan&nbsp; on the opposite&nbsp; bank. <br><br>For the operation of such ferry&nbsp; service two applications were filed with the&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Commission: one by Ponciano P. Carillo who proposed&nbsp; to operate between&nbsp; the barrio of Mabangug, in the municipality of Aparri, and the&nbsp; barrio&nbsp; of&nbsp; Alinunu,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; municipality of&nbsp; Camalaniugan, and the other by Balbino&nbsp; Remigio, who proposed to operate between the same barrio of Mabangug, Aparri, and&nbsp; the barrio of Catotoran, in the municipality of Camalaniugan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of both ferries is to bridge a gap in a national land highway where it&nbsp; is interrupted by a body of water. <br><br>Both applications&nbsp; were opposed by&nbsp; Alfonso Cababa, an operator of a&nbsp; ferry service&nbsp; across the same river but between&nbsp; two barrios of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; municipality, namely, the barrios of Catotoran and Calaoagan, both in the municipality of Camalaniugan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The oppositor had a certificate of public convenience from the Public Service Commission and&nbsp; a contract with the&nbsp; said municipality for the operation of that ferry. <br><br>Alleging that the applications of Carrilo&nbsp; and Remigio had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been disapproved by&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; council of Camalaniugan, the oppositor also&nbsp; moved for the dismissal of those applications on the&nbsp; theory that the Public Service Commission had no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to grant&nbsp; them without the previous approval&nbsp; of the municipalities&nbsp; concerned. <br><br>The Commission denied the&nbsp; motion after hearing applicant's evidence on&nbsp; the&nbsp; merits.&nbsp; But the&nbsp; proceedings were&nbsp; interrupted because, upon a new date being set for the continuation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; hearing, the oppositor came&nbsp; to this Court with&nbsp; the present&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; certiorari and prohibition to have us annul the order denying his motion to dismiss and also to have the Commission&nbsp; desist from further hearing the applications for lack of jurisdiction. <br><br>We find the petition to be without&nbsp; merit. <br><br>In contending that the Commission has&nbsp; no jurisdiction to entertain&nbsp; applications for the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; ferry without the said&nbsp; applications being first approved by the municipalities concerned, petitioner relies upon our decision in the cases of Municipality of Gattaran vs. Doroteo Elizaga, 91&nbsp;&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 440,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Gattaran&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Fruto&nbsp; Elizaga, 91 Phil.&nbsp; 440,&nbsp; where&nbsp; we said&nbsp; that&nbsp; when a&nbsp; private&nbsp; party&nbsp; obtains&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; permit&nbsp;&nbsp; from&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; council for&nbsp; the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of a&nbsp; municipal ferry, he must, before he can operate, "first obtain a certificate or permit from the Public Service Commission", but that the Commission had no power to consider and grant the applications in those two cases without previous municipal approval, "for the reason that the ferries in question were within the&nbsp; territorial&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipality." The cases&nbsp; cited are authority for&nbsp; holding that where a ferry lies entirely&nbsp; within&nbsp; the territorial jurisdiction of a municipality,&nbsp; previous approval of that municipality&nbsp; is necessary before the Public Service Commission can grant a private operator a certificate of public convenience for its&nbsp; operation; but&nbsp; they cannot be invoked as a precedent for the case now before us where&nbsp; the&nbsp; ferry service proposed is between two municipalities and serves as a continuation, by&nbsp; watercraft, of a national&nbsp; highway.&nbsp; If local authorization&nbsp; were needed for&nbsp; the operation of such a ferry&nbsp; service, that&nbsp; authorization should&nbsp; more properly come from the provincial board since there are two municipalities involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we note that the&nbsp; provincial board of&nbsp; Cagayan has,&nbsp; as a matter of fact, already declared itself in favor of allowing the proposed ferry service, since it has, by&nbsp; resolution,&nbsp; taken&nbsp; note&nbsp; of the inadequacy of the existing service and&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; the&nbsp; belief that&nbsp; service would&nbsp; be improved with the allowance of new operators, and it has&nbsp; also ordered&nbsp; a copy of the resolution sent to the&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Service Commission "for its&nbsp; consideration in determining cases&nbsp; now pending before said Commission for the authority&nbsp; to operate&nbsp; said service."<br><br>Not being a municipal ferry and impressed as it&nbsp; is with the character of a national&nbsp; highway on&nbsp; one&nbsp; side of&nbsp; the river and its&nbsp; continuation on the opposite side, the ferry proposed by each&nbsp; of the respondent applicants, or rather the&nbsp; authority for&nbsp; its&nbsp; operation as a public&nbsp; service does not need municipal approval before it can be granted by the&nbsp; Public Service&nbsp; Commission.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing, the petition&nbsp; for certiorari and prohibition is&nbsp; dismissed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the petitioner. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B, L.,&nbsp; Endencia,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><br></div>
