				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition&nbsp; for certiorari and prohibition.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that&nbsp; on 21 September 1955, respondent Rehabilitation Finance Corporation&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Municipal Court of Manila a complaint for detainer to recover from her a&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; together with the house erected thereon located at&nbsp; No. 209 Padilla&nbsp; street, San Miguel, Manila (civil No. 39651, Annex P); that on 16 November 1955 she filed an answer (Annex P-1) and on 5 January 1956 a supplemental answer to the complaint (Annex P-2); that at the&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; corporation introduced documentary evidence&nbsp; (Exhibits A, A-1, A-2, B and C) upon which she raised the issue of ownership or title to the parcel of land and house erected thereon involved in the case; that on 7 February 1956, with leave of court, the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the&nbsp; case for lack of jurisdiction&nbsp; (Annex P-3);&nbsp; that on&nbsp; 10 February 1956 the Municipal&nbsp; Court denied her&nbsp; motion (Annex&nbsp; P-4); that counsel for the petitioner filed a motion for the continuance of&nbsp; the hearing of the case because of previous professional engagement, which was denied; that on 6 March 1956, upon the evidence&nbsp; presented, the Municipal Court rendered judgment ordering the defendant, petitioner herein, to vacate the parcel of land and the house erected thereon,&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the respondent corporation the sum of P2,7O0 as rentals&nbsp; in&nbsp; arrears as&nbsp; of 10 May&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; with interest from the filing of the complaint, and the sum of P140 monthly beginning 11 May 1955 until the premises is vacated,&nbsp; and to pay the costs&nbsp; (Annex P-5);&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petitioner appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila and reproduced her answer filed in the Municipal&nbsp; Court (case No. 29483, Annex P-6); that on&nbsp; 6&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1956 the respondent corporation moved for&nbsp; execution of the judgment rendered by the Municipal Court pending appeal for failure of the&nbsp; petitioner to file&nbsp; a supersedeas bond&nbsp; of P4,100 and to pay the monthly rental of P140 (Annex P-7); that on&nbsp; 16&nbsp; July 1956 the petitioner filed an opposition to the respondent corporation's motion&nbsp; (Annex P-8); that on&nbsp; 18 October 1956 the respondent court granted the respondent corporation's motion (Annexes P-9&nbsp; ad P-9A); and that on 19 November 1956&nbsp; a writ of execution was issued&nbsp; directing the respondent sheriff of Manila to oust the petitioner from the premises in question&nbsp; (Annex P-10).<br><br>Claiming that as the Municipal Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the&nbsp; case, the judgment rendered therein (Annex P-5), the orders of the respondent court of 18 October and 10 November 1956 granting respondent corporation's motion for execution pending appeal (Annexes L-9 and P-9A) and the writ of execution issued to enforce the said judgment and orders&nbsp; (Annex P-10) are null and void, and for that reason the petitioner prays that&nbsp; upon the filing of the required bond,&nbsp; a&nbsp; writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; be issued enjoining&nbsp; the respondent sheriff from enforcing the writ of execution issued by the respondent court; that after hearing the said writ&nbsp; be declared final and the judgment of the Municipal Court null and void; that the respondent corporation be ordered to pay the costs; and that she be granted other just and equitable relief.<br><br>On 3 January 1957 this Court granted the petitioner's prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction upon the filing of a bond in&nbsp; the sum of P1,000.&nbsp; On 12 January&nbsp; 1957 the petitioner&nbsp; filed in this Court an <i>ex-parte</i> urgent petition dated 10 January 1957 praying that as she had already been ousted from the premises, the writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction&nbsp; therefore issued be amended to make it one of preliminary mandatory injunction.&nbsp; On 1 February 1957 the respondent&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an opposition thereto. On 15&nbsp; February 1957, this Court granted&nbsp; the petition for a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; mandatory&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; upon the filing by her of a bond&nbsp; in the sum of P5,000.<br><br>The petitioner was the owner of the parcel of land and the house erected thereon involved in the case.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 16 May 1949 she mortgaged the property to&nbsp; the respondent corporation to secure the payment of a real estate loan in the sum of P9,000.&nbsp; Because of her failure to&nbsp; comply with the terms and conditions of the mortgage, as agreed upon, the respondent corporation foreclosed the mortgage under&nbsp; the provisions of&nbsp; Act No. 3135, as amended.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the public auction sale conducted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sheriff of the City of Manila on 10 September 1951, the property was sold to the respondent corporation being: the highest bidder, subject to&nbsp; the petitioner's&nbsp; right to redeem it within one&nbsp; year from date of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; (Annexes A and&nbsp; B).&nbsp; The petitioner continued to occupy and use the house and parcel of land.&nbsp; Because she failed to redeem it within the period of redemption, on 15 April 1953 the respondent corporation consolidated ownership thereof (Annex C).&nbsp; On 29 August 1952 the petitioner offered to repurchase the property for the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P10,569.23,&nbsp; payable&nbsp; 20 per cent&nbsp; down,&nbsp; the balance in ten years on a monthly amortization plan with interest at 6 per cent per annum, subject to&nbsp; the following conditions:<br><blockquote>a. That I&nbsp; shall complete the down payment&nbsp; of 20 per cent within two (2) months from the date I receive notice of acceptance by the&nbsp; Corporation, and upon my failure to do so, the RFC may consider the sale to me of the said property automatically cancelled and&nbsp; forfeit any deposit of&nbsp; P700 which&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; applied as rent and/or&nbsp; damages without resorting to judicial action;<br><br>b. That in addition to&nbsp; the monthly amortizations,&nbsp; I&nbsp; shall&nbsp; pay the amount due for realty taxes and insurance premiums, and failure on my part to pay the same within&nbsp; six&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; months from the due date, the RFC may advance&nbsp; the said amount and I shall reimburse the same with interest at 6 per cent; and<br><br>c. That I conform with the conditions appearing in the attached appendix "A".<br></blockquote>and&nbsp; deposited&nbsp; with the&nbsp; respondent corporation the&nbsp; sum of P700 to&nbsp; back&nbsp; up her&nbsp; offer&nbsp; (Exhibits&nbsp; A and A-1). Notwithstanding the lapse of the period of&nbsp; redemption,&nbsp; on 15 September 1952 the respondent&nbsp; corporation accepted the petitioner's proposal to repurchase the property for the sum she had offered less&nbsp; P436.32, representing 50 per cent of the&nbsp; penal clause, thereby reducing the repurchase price to P10,132.91, and requested her&nbsp; to remit&nbsp; the balance&nbsp; of 20 per cent of&nbsp; the repurchase&nbsp; price agreed upon or the sum of P1,326.58&nbsp; (Exhibit A-2).&nbsp; As the petitioner failed to make the remittance&nbsp; to complete payment of the&nbsp; 20 per cent of the&nbsp; repurchase price within two&nbsp; months from receipt of the notice of acceptance, on 19&nbsp; February 1953 the respondent corporation cancelled the resale of the property to the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; She requested the respondent corporation several extensions&nbsp; of time to complete payment of the&nbsp; 20 per cent of the repurchase price&nbsp; agreed upon and the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; corporation received&nbsp; from&nbsp; her the sums of P500 on 17 March 1954 and P300 on 10 November 1954, thereby raising&nbsp; her total&nbsp; payments made to&nbsp; only P1,500, leaving a balance of P526.58 still due and unpaid. On 18&nbsp; January 1955 the respondent&nbsp; corporation notified the petitioner that for failure to&nbsp; complete payment&nbsp; of the 20 per&nbsp; cent of the repurchase price agreed upon, demand was made upon her&nbsp; to pay the sum&nbsp; of P2,420 as rentals due and unpaid and to vacate the premises (Annex D), the contract of resale having been&nbsp; cancelled and the&nbsp; payments&nbsp; therefore made considered as&nbsp; rentals at the&nbsp; rate of&nbsp; P140 monthly.<br><br>Paragraph 7&nbsp; of the conditions to be incorporated in the contract of resale (Appendix A,&nbsp; Exhibit A-1) signed by the petitioner and attached to her offer&nbsp; to repurchase the property, partly states:<br><blockquote>7. That&nbsp; pending full&nbsp; payment of the purchase price, advances and interest, the&nbsp; title to the real estate property and all&nbsp; the improvements&nbsp; thereon shall remain in the name of this Corporation until after&nbsp; said&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; price, advances&nbsp; and&nbsp; interest shall have been fully&nbsp; paid. * * *.<br></blockquote>It is, therefore, clear that the ownership of the property in question has never been transfered to the petitioner and has remained&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; corporation. By&nbsp; continuing to stay in the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; in question after&nbsp; it was sold to the respondent corporation and the&nbsp; latter acquired absolute ownership thereof, the petitioner merely acquired the status of a lessee.,&nbsp; In her offer&nbsp; to repurchase the property&nbsp; (Exhibit A, the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that upon&nbsp; failure to complete payment of the 20 per cent of the&nbsp; repurchase price agreed&nbsp; upon, the respondent corporation may&nbsp; consider&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; automatically&nbsp; cancelled&nbsp; and&nbsp; forfeit her deposit of P700&nbsp; which shall be applied as rent and/or damages without resorting to judicial&nbsp; action.&nbsp; In view thereof the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; defeat the respondent corporation's&nbsp; title to the property,&nbsp; now that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; the absolute owner thereof and the contract to resell considered automatically cancelled.&nbsp;&nbsp; In actions of forcible entry and detainer, it is a well-established rule that mere filing of an answer, claiming title to the premises involved or raising the question of ownership, will not divest a&nbsp; justice of the peace court of its jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; her letter dated 1&amp; December 1956 addressed to the respondent&nbsp; corporation, written on the very day this petition was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in this Court and worded as follows:<br><br>In connection with the ejectment case against me, I have&nbsp; the honor to request for the postponement&nbsp; of its enforcement today and therefore request up to December 30, 1956 in order to enable me to look for a place to live in.&nbsp; I hereby promise to surrender the peaceful&nbsp; possession of the property&nbsp; on&nbsp; that date&nbsp; to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation thru any of its representative. (Annex R-2) renders the petitioners unworthy of the&nbsp; relief prayed&nbsp; for in this proceedings.<br><br>The petition for a&nbsp; writ of certiorari and prohibition is denied&nbsp; and the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction heretofore&nbsp; issued dissolved,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against&nbsp;&nbsp; the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
