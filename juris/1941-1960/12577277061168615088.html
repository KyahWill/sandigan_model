				<H3>JUAN L. CLEMENTE, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND H. E. HEACOCK CO., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Juan L. Clemente, against whom a final judgment for a sum of money 
was obtained in a foreclosure suit, appeals by certiorari from the decision of 
the Court of Appeals affirming the order of the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
confirming the sate at public auction of the mortgaged properties in favor of 
the judgment creditor, herein respondent H. E. Heacock Company. The main 
contention of petitioner is that he was not given a hearing on the merits of the 
opposition to the confirmation of the sale of his properties.
<p>On March 25, 1955, after the judgment of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 
20460-R sentencing petitioner to pay respondent H. E. Heacock Co. the sum of 
P9,319.21, plus interest, attorney's fees, and costs had become final, H. E. 
Heacock Co. applied for and obtained a writ of execution by virtue of which the 
Provincial Sheriff of Rizal, on May 23, 1955, sold at public auction 
petitioner's mortgaged properties (3 parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 1182, 
11773, and 19365 of the Register of Deeds of Rizal) to respondent H. E. Heacock 
Co., the highest bidder, for P14,301.34, and issued to the latter the 
corresponding certificate of sale.</p>
<p>On June 27, 1956, respondent H. E. Heacock Co. filed a motion for 
confirmation of sale, with due notice to petitioner that said motion was to be 
heard on June 30, 1956. On the date of the hearing, petitioner appeared by 
counsel and requested that he be given 7 days within which to present his 
written opposition, which the court granted. On July 6, 1956, petitioner filed 
his written opposition which in part states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"III. That the confirmation of the sale would be contrary to Art. 1619 of 
Rep. Act 386 and deprive him (petitioner) of the right to extinguish the 
judgment sale by reimbursing plaintiff (respondent H-E. Heacock Co.) as well as 
Second Mortgagee of the price paid thereof.</p>
<p>"It is submitted that the foregoing grounds need not be argued. They are 
self-explanatory and in themselves sufficient to inform this Honorable Court of 
the rights of defendant and of which law and equity would not deprive him.</p>
<p>"One point however, cannot be overlooked in this case, and it is that there 
is apparent collusion between plaintiff Heacock and the Second Mortgagee, 
ostensibly for the purpose of defeating the chances of the defendant in 
redeeming his properties, through the Motion for Confirmation of Sale. * * 
*."</p></blockquote>
<p>The incident was thus submitted for resolution and on September 17, 1956, the 
court issued the following order of confirmation of sale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"ORDER</p>
<p>"After hearing and consideration of the motion for confirmation of sate, 
dated June 27, 1956, filed by the plaintiff, thru counsel, and the opposition 
thereto by counsel for the defendant, and the Court, finding the reasons given 
in support thereof to be well-founded, hereby confirms the sale at public 
auction made by the Sheriff of Rizal on May 23, 1955.</p>
<p>"It is so ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p>On October 2, 1956, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of said 
order of confirmation of sale, on the ground that it is contrary to law.</p>
<p>On November 6, 1956, respondent H. E. Heacock Co. filed an urgent motion for 
writ of possession, to which petitioner filed an opposition on November 9, 
1956.</p>
<p>On December 20, 1956, the court issued an order denying petitioner's motion 
for reconsideration of the order of confirmation of sale dated October 2, 1956. 
On the same date, the court issued an order granting respondent H. E. Heacock 
Co.'s urgent motion for writ of possession of November 6, 1956.</p>
<p>From these orders, petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, and said 
court, on October 31, 1958, rendered a decision affirming the same, in part 
stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The alleged <em>collusion</em> between the H.E. Heacock Co. and Amparo Helen 
de Guzman was not shown. Appellant contends that he has been deprived of the 
opportunity to prove it, but such contention is untenable, as the record fails 
to reveal that he had even attempted to offer evidence <em>during the 
hearing</em> held to determine whether or not the sale should be confirmed.</p>
<p>"The truth, after all, is that appellant definitely lost his right to redeem 
the foreclosed properties when he failed to do so during the ninety (90) days 
period from notice of the decision of the Court of Appeals referred to above. 
Article 1619 of the Civil Code is not applicable here.</p>
<p>"The confirmation of the sale as sought by appellee is, therefore, due. The 
writ of possession is only a sequence of the confirmation of the sale.</p>
<p>"There being no reversible error in the order appealed from, the same is 
hereby affirmed, without further costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 6, 1958, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of said 
decision, on the ground that the Court of Appeals erroneously assumed that the 
lower court held a hearing on the motion for confirmation of sale in question 
and the opposition thereto. Said motion was denied and, on February 27, 1959, 
petitioner filed a second motion for reconsideration, on the grounds that (1) 
his claim that there was no hearing on said motion for confirmation of sale, is 
confirmed by the letter dated November 5, 1957, of the Clerk of Court of .First 
Instance of Rizal; and (2) the court overlooked the fact that he is allowed by 
law to repurchase the properties "foreclosed under equity of redemption.</p>
<p>Said second motion for reconsideration, having been denied by the Court of 
Appeals, petitioner filed with us this present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>We find no merit in the petition.</p>
<p>The records reveal that respondent corporation's motion for confirmation of 
the sale (dated June 26, 1956), which was set for hearing on June 30, 1956 at 
8:30 a.m., was actually heard on said date, wherein the trial court, not only 
heard petitioner's oral objection thereto, but also, upon his own motion, 
granted him sufficient time to prepare and submit a written opposition, which he 
duly filed on July 6,1956. After filing said written opposition, petitioner had 
no reason to expect another (or second) hearing on the same motion for 
confirmation, especially so when he never asked for a second hearing thereon. 
Indeed, he in fact expressly waived the same when he stated in his written 
opposition that-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is submitted that the foregoing grounds need not be argued. They are 
self-explanatory and in themselves sufficient to inform this Honorable Court of 
the rights of defendant (herein petitioner) and of which, law and equity would 
not deprive him."</p></blockquote>
<p>Following well-established rules of procedure, the trial court rightly 
considered said motion and opposition thereto submitted for decision.</p>
<p>That there was in fact a hearing on the motion for confirmation of sale in 
question, is evident from the trial court's order of September 17, 1956 
confirming the sale, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>After hearing and consideration of the motion for confirmation of 
sale</em>, dated June 27, 1956, filed by plaintiff (herein respondent H. E. 
Heacock Co.) thru counsel, <em>and the opposition thereto by counsel for the 
defendant</em> (herein petitioner), and the Court finding the reasons given in 
support thereof to be well-founded, hereby confirms the sale at public auction 
made by the Sheriff of Rizal on May 23, 1955." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In this connection, respondent Court of Appeals also stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The alleged <em>collusion</em> between the H. E. Heacock Co. and Amparo 
Belen de Guzman was not shown. Appellant contends that he has been deprived of 
the opportunity to prove it, but such contention is untenable, as the record 
fails to reveal that he had even attempted to offer evidence <em>during the 
hearing held</em> to determine whether or not the sale should be confirmed." 
(Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In support of his stand that no hearing on the motion for confirmation of 
sale was made in the trial court, petitioner makes capital of the letter dated 
November 5,1957 (Annex E-1) of the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of Rizal 
addressed to the Deputy Clerk of Court of the Court of Appeals, reading as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In reply to your letter of the 29th ult., please be informed that no hearing 
on the merits was held in this case and consequently no minutes were prepared by 
the Deputy Clerk of Court <em>in connection with the appealed orders both dated 
Dee. 10, 1956, the first denying motion to set aside order confirming auction 
sale, and the second directing issuance of writ of possession</em>." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>But the above-quoted letter of the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of 
Rizal, makes no reference whatsoever to the motion for confirmation of sale 
dated June 27, 1956, but specifically and definitely mentions (1) the order 
dated December 20, 1956 denying the motion to set aside the order confirming the 
sale; and (2) the order of the same date directing the issuance of writ of 
possession.</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding no error in the decision of respondent Court of Appeals, 
the same is hereby affirmed in all respects, with costs against the petitioner. 
So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. 
L., Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed</em>.</p></div>
