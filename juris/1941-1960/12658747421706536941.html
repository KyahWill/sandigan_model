				<H3>LIM HOA TING, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. CENTRAL BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts of the present case are not in dispute. In fact, the decision of 
the lower court was rendered on the pleadings, after defendant Central Bank of 
the Philippines had made certain admissions and answers to written 
interrogatories filed by the plaintiff. Consequently, the appeal by defendant 
Central Bank of the Philippines comes direct to us. 
<p>As an importer, plaintiff-appellee Lim Hoa Ting paid the defendant Bank the 
amount of P650.26 and P1,526.23 on November 11, 1954 and April 5, 1955, 
respectively, or a total of P2,176.49, representing the 17 per cent exchange tax 
on the sale of foreign exchange, for the payment of the costs and other charges 
incident to the importation into the Philippines of "mono-sodium glutamate". 
Before said dates, defendant had been refunding to the plaintiff the exchange 
taxes paid by him for the importation of the same substance mono-sodium 
glutamate, as it had also approved the applications for exemption from the same 
exchange taxes of other importers of the same commodity, in the aggregate amount 
of P3,215,416.72. The refunds were made under the provisions of Republic Act No. 
601, as amended, Section 2 of which reads in part: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>* * * the tax collected * * * on foreign exchange used for the payment of the 
cost, transportation and/or other charges incident to importation in the 
Philippines of stabilizers and flavors * * * shall be refunded to any importer 
making application therefor* * *." </p></blockquote>
<p>In Appendix A of Republic Act No. 650, effective July 1, 1951, under which 
the Import Control Commission was created, which Appendix A contains a 
classification of commodities allowed importation, there appears under the 
heading "Chemicals, Drugs, Dyes, Medicines and Medical Equipment and Supplies" 
the following: "flavoring extracts : 'ajinomoto, vetsin, etc.'" "Ajinomoto" and 
"Vetsin" are trademarks of commercial products in the preparation of which, 
mono-sodium glutamate largely enters. </p>
<p>When the Import Control Commission was abolished by operation of law, its 
functions were assumed by the Monetary Board of the defendant Central Bank. 
Through a series of regulations implementing Circular No. 44, specifically, 
Regulation No. 1, to which is attached Appendix A, approved by the Monetary 
Board on June 30, 1953, there appears under item No. 510147, the following:</p>
<p>"Flavoring preparationsâ€”Mono-Sodium Glutamate" From this, it is apparent that 
defendant Central Bank, through the Monetary Board, had adopted the same 
classification of commodities to be allowed importation, in the sense that 
mono-sodium glutamate was considered and classified as a flavoring extract. That 
was the reason why all exchange taxes previously paid by importers of 
mono-sodium glutamate had been refunded, as already stated, under the provisions 
of Section 2, Republic Act No. 601, which authorized refund of exchange taxes on 
commodities and substances listed and classified as flavors. </p>
<p>However, on September 14, 1953, the officer in charge of the exchange tax 
administration of defendant Central Bank, submitted a memorandum to the Monetary 
Board, suggesting that mono-sodium glutamate be "no longer classified as a 
flavor", for the reason that if said substance is to be considered as a flavor 
when it is mainly used in the manufacture of the condiment commonly known as 
"Vetsin", then Lea and Perrin's sauce, onions, garlic, catsup and even common 
salt might also be considered flavors when they are really condiments and 
seasoning agents and, therefore, exchange taxes paid for their importation 
should also be refunded; and that moreover, since monosodium glutamate was 
classified as a flavor, its importation had increased considerably to the 
prejudice of the revenues of the state. Following said suggestion, the Monetary 
Board, on September 15, 1953, passed resolution No. 756, "eliminating 
'mono-sodium glutamate as flavor' under existing Central Bank regulations on the 
use of foreign exchange for importation." This resolution, however, was not 
published in the Official Gazette. </p>
<p>It would appear, however, that the same officer in charge of the exchange tax 
administration in the Central Bank who had made the suggestion about the 
elimination of mono-sodium glutamate from the classification as flavors, changed 
his mind after he had had a conference with the Director of the Institute of 
Science and Technology on the meaning and scope of the terms "condiment" and 
"flavor". Said opinion is contained in a subsequent memorandum, dated August 3, 
1955, of the said officer for the Monetary Board, wherein he states in part: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The technical opinion of the Director of the Institute of Science and 
Technology on the interpretation of the terms 'condiment' and 'flavor' is 
reflected in a letter to Senator Primicias dated June 15, 1955, copy of which is 
hereto attached, in a case involving another article, the said opinion, however, 
being a general discussion of the interpretation of the terms 'condiment' and 
'flavor'. According to the said opinion of the Director of Science and 
Technology, 'flavor' is a general term which includes those preparations 
regarded as condiments even if such preparations contain pepper, mustard, 
garlic, and other spices. In another part of the letter to Senator Primicias, 
the Director states the following: 'Republic Act No. 601, as amended (Republic 
Act Nos. 814, 871, and 1197) used the word "FLAVORS" and not "CONDIMENTS". 
inasmuch as the former embraces the limited meaning of the latter.' </p>
<p>"Prior to the departure of the Director of Science and Technology, the Legal 
Counsel, the Auditor, the Drug Consultant of the Office, and the undersigned had 
a long conference with him, and after the conference we were agreed that in view 
of the technical definition of the term 'flavor' we would have to consider 
Monosodium Glutamate as failing under the exemption provided for by law. </p>
<p>"In view of this, it is recommended that the Monetary Board reconsider its 
Resolution No. 756, of September 15, 1953, by holding that Mono-Sodium Glutamate 
falls under the term "flavors" which are exempt from the exchange 
tax."</p></blockquote>
<p>Before submitting the above memorandum, the said officer in charge of the 
exchange tax administration of defendant Central Bank, acting on an inquiry from 
plaintiff's counsel about the refund of exchange taxes previously collected on 
the importation of mono-sodium glutamate, made the following reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Please be informed that in a recent certification made by the Director of 
Science and Technology, mono-sodium glutamate is considered a 'flavor' and as 
such, the tax exemption provided for by the Exchange Tax Law covers the 
above-mentioned item of importation. You may, therefore, accordingly resume 
filing your applications for exemption and refund but through your negotiating. 
bank, in accordance with the latest procedure promulgated by the Central Bank on 
the matter."</p></blockquote>
<p>Acting upon said advice, plaintiff filed his application No. 422-7 for the 
refund of the two-amounts afore-mentioned, totalling P2,176.49, but the 
defendant Central Bank refused to make the refund, thereby precipitating the 
initiation of the present court proceedings for the collection thereof. </p>
<p>The trial court, citing the opinion of the Director of the Institute of 
Science and Technology and definitions given in Webster's International 
Dictionary, including the Wall Street Journal and Scientific Monthly, came to 
the conclusion that mono-sodium glutamate comes under the definition of flavors 
and flavoring extracts, and therefore, exchange taxes paid for its importation 
were refundable, and in its decision ordered defendant Central Bank to make the 
refund in the following dispositive part of its decision: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing considerations, this Court hereby renders judgment, 
ordering the Central Bank to refund to the herein plaintiff the aggregate sum of 
P2,176.49, which represents plaintiff's payment of the 17 per cent exchange tax, 
covered by CBP Official Receipts Nos. 614833 and 689703, with costs against the 
defendant. There being no evidence in the record of this case to sustain the 
damages claimed by plaintiff in his complaint, and considering that actuaton of 
the Central Bank, in refusing to refund to the plaintiff the aforesaid exchange 
tax, was made in good faith, no damages and attorney's fees is hereby granted to 
the plaintiff." </p></blockquote>
<p>The defendant Bank is now appealing from that decision, and in support of its 
contention that mono-sodium glutamate is not a flavoring extract but rather a 
condiment, cites articles published in the Chemical Engineering Progress of the 
American Institute of Chemical Engineers, Science on the March in Scientific 
Monthly, and from the book entitled, "Foods, their Selection and Preparation" by 
Stanley and Kline. The defendant further claims that the term "flavor" refers 
only to the substances for the manufacture of soft drinks, ice cream, or drugs 
and medicines. </p>
<p>With no disrespect to the scientific opinions cited by the defendant Bank, we 
prefer to accept the opinion of our local Institute of Science and Technology, 
which holds that mono-sodium glutamate is a flavor or flavoring extract, and 
that it even includes condiments. Furthermore, according to the record, 
mono-sodium glutamate has in the past been consistently classified and 
considered as a flavor and flavoring extract, not only by the Import Control 
Commission, but also by its successor, the defendant Bank itself, to say nothing 
of the fact that the law itself seems to have favored this interpretation. This 
contemporaneous construction is highly persuasive: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The practice and interpretive regulations by officers, administrative 
agencies, departmental heads and other officials charged with the duty of 
administering and enforcing a statute will carry great weight in determining the 
operation of a statute." (2 Sutherland, Statutory Construction, p. 516). </p>
<p>"In the construction of a doubtful and ambiguous law, the contemporaneous 
construction of those who are called upon to act under the law, and were 
appointed to carry its provisions into effect, is entitled to very great 
respect." (Edwards Lessee <i>vs.</i> Darby, 12 Wheat. 206, 
210).</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on the above rule, Erwin N. Criswold of the Harvard Law School, 
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Another reason why contemporaneousness is an important factor is its bearing 
on the need for certainty and predictability in our tax laws. This is where the 
notion of the Court's function in the scheme of judicial tax administration 
becomes important. A statute is enacted. A regulation is issued. It will, in the 
normal course of events, be five or six years, and very likely more, before the 
construction of the statute, in the light of the regulation, will come before 
the Supreme Court. In the meantime, people will go on living, and transactions 
will be conducted under the statute, perhaps all the transactions that are ever 
to be conducted under the statute. Thus, it seems that a strong argument can be 
made in favor of giving very heavy weight to a contemporaneous regulation, so 
that taxpayers may rely upon it and have some certainty that it will be followed 
by the courts. * * *" (A Summary of the Regulations Problem, 54 Harvard Law 
Review, p. 398, 406).</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem that the main reason for the defendant Bank in holding to 
reclassify and remove it from the category of flavor or flavoring extract was 
for revenue purposes. Under the exemption or right to refund, said substance of 
mono-sodium glutamate had considerably increased in importation and the Bank 
sadly realized the loss of revenue to the Government. If the Government desires 
to make a reclassification so as to impose the exchange tax on the importation 
of this substance for revenue purposes, the Legislature can easily do so in the 
form of an amendment to the law. We hold, as did the trial court, that the 
subsequent interpretation given by the defendant Bank not to consider 
mono-sodium glutamate as a flavor or flavoring extract, is rather arbitrary, if 
not beyond the scope of its powers and authority. </p>
<p>Furthermore, as already stated, Resolution No. 756 of the Monetary Board, as 
well as the revised classification, under which mono-sodium glutamate was no 
longer considered a flavor and so not exempted from the exchange tax, was not 
published in the Official Gazette. Consequently, it could not bind the 
plaintiff. Said this Court as regards the noneffectivity of Circular No. 20 of 
the Central Bank for lack of publication in the Official Gazette:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"However, section 11 of the Revised Administrative Code, provides that 
statutes passed by Congress shall, in the absence of special provision, take 
effect at the beginning of the fifteenth day after the completion of the 
publication of the statute in the Official Gazette. Article 2 of the New Civil 
Code (Republic Act No. 386) equally provides that the laws shall take effect 
after fifteen days following the completion of their publication in the Official 
Gazette, unless it is otherwise provided. It is true that Circular No. 20 of the 
Central Bank is not a statute or law but being issued for the implementation of 
the law authorizing its issuance, it has the force and effect of law according 
to settled jurisprudence. (See U. S. <i>vs.</i> Tupasi Molina, 29 Phil. 119 and 
authorities cited therein.) Moreover, as a rule, circulars and regulations 
especially like the Circular No. 20 of the Central Bank in question which 
prescribes a penalty for its violation should be published before becoming 
effective, this, on the general principle and theory that before the public is 
bound by its contents, especially its penal provisions, a law, regulation or 
circular must first be published and the people officially and specifically 
informed of said contents and its penalties." (People <i>vs.</i> Que Po Lay, 50 
Off. Gaz., [10] 4850; 94 Phil., 640).</p></blockquote>
<p>We notice that the trial court imposes costs on the defendant Bank, this 
despite its finding that the Central Bank acted in good faith. We believe that 
it is more in accord with justice to eliminate this portion of the award of the 
trial court, aside from the fact that defendant Bank is an agency of the 
Government charged with the administration of the exchange law. With this 
modification, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed. No costs in either 
instance.</p>
