				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Quezon, convicting appellant of murder.
<p> The evidence shows that between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening of
October 14, 1946, while Gregorio Reyes Uy Un was asleep on the floor of
the house of Siaba, his nephew, in barrio Vigo Kantidang, San Narciso,
Quezon province, he was killed by two carbine shots fired from outside
the house, one bullet entering the right side of his abdomen near the
navel and coming out below the right clavicle, and the other having its
entrance an inch below the navel and its exit above the left nipple,
the trajectory of the bullets being almost parallel to the body. The
other inmates of the house were awakened by the shots but were not able
to see the one who had fired them. Notified of the incident the next
morning, the chief of police and the justice of the peace of the town
repaired to the scene of the crime and made an investigation. On the
mat near the cadaver two .30 cal. slugs were found, while on the ground
under one of the sidings of the house a police sergeant picked up two
empty .30 cal. carbine shells. In the course of the investigation, the
chief of police sighted Jose Carbido carrying a carbine, and, his
suspicion having been aroused, questioned Carbido about the gun. The
latter explained that, by order of his brother Antonio, he had borrowed
it from appellant. Examining the carbine, the attention of the chief of
police was called to a piece of dried coconut leaf which got stuck
between the barrel and the tip of the stock, and noting its similarity
to the dried coconut leaves which formed the sidings of the house where
Uy Un was killed, he inspected the sidings of said house and there
found a little opening into which the barrel of a gun might have been
inserted. As the carbine was unlicensed, he had it confiscated and at
the same time had appellant summoned Tor investigation. Questioned by
the chief of police on the following day, appellant made a statement
(Exhibit 1) to the effect that the carbine was given to him by
Gaudencio Medinilla I,mayor of San Narciso) in May, 1946, for hunting
purposes but was borrowed from him by Jose Carbido in the morning of
October 15, 1946, and that on the night of the crime he was at home in
Tala (a barrio adjoining that where Uy Un was killed) and did not go
out that whole night. On the strength of this declaration, he was
ordered released.</p>
<p> Not satisfied with the result of the investigation conducted by the
municipal police, the military police of Quezon province took a hand in
the matter and questioned appellant on November 2, 1946. In this
investigation appellant made another statement (Exhibit 2) to the
effect that at about 9 o'clock in the evening of October 14, 1946, he
went hunting in the coconut grove of Gaudencio Medinilla in the
aforementioned barrio of Tala and there met Leoncio Hanabaab with a
carbine, who enjoined him not to tell anybody of their meeting because
he (Hanabaab) had shot Uy Un. But submitted to further questioning five
days latter, appellant gave a still different story {Exhibit 5), saying
that at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon of October 14, 1946, the Pabon
brothers (Bernardo, Antonio, and Lucio) had him accompany them to Uy
Un's coconut grove to hunt wild boars, but that once they were there
and while waiting for the moon to come out, they confided to him that
their real object was to kill Uy Un, whom they proposed to shoot with
the carbine which they now forced appellant to loan to them, their
motive being to get even with their intended victim because he once had
them prosecuted for the theft of his carabao; that against his will he
was made to go along with them until they got to the house where Uy-Un
was, which they found lighted; that to have a good view of the people
inside the house, two of the Pabon brothers took a big rock and placed
it under the window; that thereafter Antonio, who now had appellant's
carbine, stood on the rock and poked the muzzle of the gun into the
siding under the window, but as the hole thus made did not suit his
purpose, he again introduced the barrel of the gun into the siding,
took a good aim and then fired twice, thereby killing Uy Un, who was
then asleep; and that thereafter the Pabon brothers, on pain of death,
warned him not to divulge what he had seen.</p>
<p> Some time thereafter, appellant was questioned by the new
provincial commander of the MPC of Quezon province, Capt. Pedro
Alcantara. Repudiating his previous statements except the first,
appellant now admitted that he was the one who shot Uy Un, but said
that he did so by order of Mayor Gaudencio Medinilla, who had a grudge
against the deceased, and that Medinilto had promised to reward him
with P300 and also to maintain his family if he should get caught. He
described the shooting as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Si, senor, en aquella hora que arriba he
mencionado (i.e., about 10 p.m., October 14,1946) me fui a la casa de
Gregorio Reyes (Uy Un) llevando el carbine. Al llegar a la mencionada
casa saque una piedra grande y lo lleve hacia la derecha de ha casa, y
lo utilize para ponerme de pie para alcanzar la venta (ventana) de la
casa, Despues abri un buquete en el tabique de la casa para que pueda
ver la gente dentro de la casa, y citisve si estaba alli a quien iba a
raatar, y corao habia aun luz en la casa pude ver que estaba alli
Gregorio Reyes y estaba acostado, el estaba mas cerca del agujero donde
escuchaba, lo que hice era meter el carbine en el agujero que habia
abierto y apunte la punta del arma a el (Gregorio) y despues estire el
gatillo dos veces. Despues de esto me marche apresurado y retire a mi
casa."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> He stated that it was not true, as he had declared in Exhibit 5,
that it was the Pabon brothers who killed the deceased and that if he
had implicated them it was because he bore them a grudge because his
sister was abducted by one of them before the war. This latest
statement of appellant was reduced to writing (Exhibit H) and was
signed and sworn to by him before the Clerk of Court of Quezon,
Gregorio L. Gonzales.</p>
<p>Because of Mayor Medinilla's alleged complicity in the crime, the
Secretary of Justice sent two NBI agents to Lucena to check on
appellant's latest statement, and armed with a signed carbon copy
thereof, Exhibit C, the agents went to see appellant in the provincial
jail of Quezon on February 3, 1947, and questioned him about his
confession, but first taking the precaution of freeing his mind from
any apprehension by sending out of the cell the provincial guards and
the son of the deceased who had come with them, and also telling
appellant that he could rely on them because they were representing
the Department of Justice and that he was free to tell if there was no
truth in what he had said in his confession. And after the agents had
read to him the said signed carbon copy of the confession and told him
not to be afraid of them, he admitted that the statements therein
contained were really made by him and that they were true and correct.
He also acknowledged his signature on the document and admitted having
affixed it "freely and spontaneously."</p>
<p> The evidence further shows that before 9 o'clock of the night in
question, while Simeona Montero, who lived in the same barrio as
appellant, was weaving a mat in the kitchen of her house, she heard her
dogs bark, and, glancing out of the window to see what it was about,
she saw, in the clear moonlight, the appellant passing by mounted on a
carabao, going towards the south (which was towards the scene of the
crime).</p>
<p> It also appears that in a decision of the Court of First Instance
of Tayabas in November, 1938, which was confirmed by the Court of
Appeals in August, 1940, appellant was convicted of theft of large
cattle upon complaint of the deceased.</p>
<p> Testifying in his defense, appellant denied having been the one who
shot the deceased Uy Un, declaring that on the night in question he was
in his house. He said that he was, through violence and threat, made to
confess what was not true and that if at first he named Hanabaab and
the Pabon brothers as the killers of the deceased it was to stop the
MPs from maltreating him. According to him, the truth was what was
contained in his first statement in which he denied having had anything
to do with the crime.</p>
<p> Corroborating appellant's alibi, Maximo Espinosa and Anacleto
Requeron declared that they passed the night of October 14, 1946,
in appellant's house where they were overtaken by darkness while going
home, and that appellant did not leave his house that night.</p>
<p> With the above evidence the trial court found Arsenio Banayad
guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment, with the
accessory penalties prescribed by law, and to pay indemnity and costs.</p>
<p> After going over the evidence, we find no sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment below.</p>
<p> This Court should be slow in revoking a judgment of conviction
based on confession. Appellant claims that the confession was wrung
from him thru threat and violence. But not only is his testimony on
this point without corroboration but it is also denied by the agents of
the law. Appellant complained to nobody regarding the alleged
maltreatment and no signs of violence were noted on his person. Indeed,
he informed the clerk of court who read to him the confession before he
signed it that the same was voluntary and spontaneous. This is also
what he later told the NBI agents after being assured that he could
tell them the truth without fear because they were representing the
Department of Justice. In the circumstances, the learned trial judge
did not err in giving weight to the confession in which appellant
admits having himself killed the deceased and retracts his previous
statements attributing the authorship of the crime to others.</p>
<p> Corroborative of the statements in the confession regarding the
manner in which the killing was done, are the direction of the bullet
wounds found on the body of the deceased, the hole or opening produced
by the insertion of the barrel of the carbine into the siding of the
house where the deceased was shot, the piece of dry coconut leaf that
was nipped from the siding of the house and got caught between the
barrel and the tip of the stock of the carbine used in the killing,
which carbine was admittedly in the possession of the appellant on the
night of the crime (October 14, 1946) since, according to his own
affidavit, it was given to him in May and was not borrowed from him by
Jose Carbido until the morning of October 15, 1946.</p>
<p> As to appellant's alibi, his claim that he did not leave his house
on the night in question has nothing to corroborate it other than the
testimony of two residents from another barrio, Anacleto Requiron and
Maximo Espinosa, who claimed to have passed that night in appellant's
house but who gave an unconvincing excuse for sleeping there, and who
also contradcited each other in that, while Requiron declared that
when, he and Espinosa left the house of appellant they woke up the
latter in order to bid him good-bye, Espinosa, on the other hand,
testified that he left without bidding appellant good-bye because the
latter was then asleep. Moreover, appellant's alibi is entirely
discredited by the witness Simeona Montero who, both in court and in
the investigation made by the police two days after the crime, gave the
information that she saw appellant pass by her house before she went to
bed at about 9 o'clock in the night of the crime. There is no showing
that this witness had any motive for not telling the truth.</p>
<p> As a possible motive for the crime, it appears that appellant had
cause for entertaining a grudge against the deceased because of his
conviction for theft upon complaint of the latter.</p>
<p> In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is affirmed with costs against the appellant.</p>
