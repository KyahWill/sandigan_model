				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Dr. JOSE EDUQUE died on June 3, 1938, without a will.  He was 
survived by three children and his second wife, SALVACION FERIA DE 
EDUQUE, who was childless.  Subsequently, Salvacion married Dr. CONRADO 
POTENCIANO, and she is now known as Mrs. Salvacion F. de Potenciano.  In
 Civil Case No. 53360 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, 
administration proceedings were commenced to administer and settle the 
estate of Dr. EDUQUE.  JOSE Q. TABORA who married ELISA EDUQUE, one of 
the children of the deceased Jose Eduque, and Mrs. Potenciano were 
appointed co-administrators.  Among the properties included in the 
estate was a lot at the corner of Legarda and Alejandro VI streets, 
Sampaloc, Manila, with an area of 858.10 square meters, covered by 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 44036 (now T.C.T. No. 6443) of the 
City of Manila.  This lot formerly contained a concrete show house known
 as the PRINCE THEATER and several apartments (accesorias).  All these 
improvements, however, were burned during the war.
  <p>    The administrator Mrs. Potenciano and Mr. Tabora desiring to 
rebuild and rehabilitate these old improvements, and one Mr. FRANCISCO 
LAZATIN, a businessman then engaged in operating movie houses, seeing 
business possibilities in said buildings if rebuilt, got together and 
finally entered into a contract of lease (Exhibit A), the main features 
of which were that Lazatin would lease the premises for a period of 
three and a half (3-1/2) years beginning July 1, 1946, at a monthly 
rental of P1,500.00, but he must rebuild the apartments and rehabilitate
 the old Prince Theater and equip it with projection and sound machines 
and systems as well as chairs, all within a period of six months, under 
penalty of paying liquidated damages.  We reproduce paragraphs 2, 3, 5, 
6, 7 and 10, the most pertinent and important provisions of the lease 
contract.  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "2.  The LESSEE shall pay the LESSOR a monthly rental of 
P1,500.00 payable in advance on or before the fifth day of every month 
beginning July 1, 1946.</p>
    <p>"3.  The LESSEE shall rebuild and reconstruct the theatre and the
 adjoining apartments in accordance with the plan and specifications 
approved by both parties and the City authorities of Manila, copies of 
which are attached hereto and made an integral part of this contract, 
and binds himself to comply with the requirements and regulations of the
 City Engineer, the Bureau of Health, the Fire Department, and other 
regulatory governmental agencies.</p>
    <p align="center">    x               x               x</p>
    <p>"5.  All the construction, improvements, apparatus, furniture and
 equipment described in paragraphs 3 and 4 above shall be at the expense
 and for the account of the LESSEE.  Upon the termination of this 
contract of lease, either because of the expiration of the term or the 
failure of the LESSEE to pay the rents in the manner herein agreed upon 
or to comply with any of the other terms and conditions of this 
contract, the LESSEE binds himself to deliver all the buildings and 
improvements, apparatus, furniture and equipment, above mentioned, in 
good condition to the LESSOR, without any reimbursement or payment for 
expenses incurred thereof.  However, the LESSEE shall have preferential 
right over other parties, all terms and conditions being equal, to lease
 the said theatre and its apparatus and equipment, as well as the 
apartments, after the termination of this contract.</p>
    <p>"6.  That immediately upon the approval by the Court of this 
contract, the LESSOR shall give notice to the tenants occupying the 
premises covered by this lease to vacate the same, and the LESSEE shall 
have the right to begin the construction immediately even before the 
commencement of this contract on July 1, 1946.  The LESSOR warrants that
 the terms of the leases of the said tenants are from month to month.</p>
    <p>"7.  In the event the LESSEE fails to complete the construction 
and installation of the buildings and improvements, apparatus, furniture
 and equipment, above mentioned, within six (6) months from the date of 
the approval of this contract by the Court, he shall pay to the LESSOR 
as liquidated damages in addition to those stipulated in paragraph 10 
below, the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS.</p>
    <p align="center">    x               x               x</p>
    <p>"10. In the event either party to this contract is constrained to
 have recourse to the courts to enforce his rights under this contract, 
the offending party shall be bound to pay the sum of P2,000.00 for 
attorney's fees and costs."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The contract was signed by the two administrators on behalf of the 
estate as LESSOR and by Lazatin, and it was approved by the probate 
court on June 10, 1946.  One of the administrators notified the tenants 
and occupants of the premises, of the lease, and Lazatin presumably took
 possession, at least of part of the property and started to have the 
plans and specifications approved by the corresponding authorities and 
to secure the necessary permit.  It is a fact however that neither the 
Prince Theater nor the apartments were rebuilt, and as we understand it,
 not even up to the present time.</p>
  <p>  On October 10, 1946, Lazatin wrote a letter (Exhibit 4) to Mrs. 
Potenciano informing her that despite all his efforts to obtain the 
necessary permit to reconstruct the Prince Theater and the apartments, 
from the City authorities and from Malacañang, he failed, due to the 
fact that it was the plan of the Government to widen calle Legarda, 
which plan would greatly affect the location of the theater; also that 
the hostile attitude of the tenants or occupants of the lot, who refused
 either to pay the rentals for their occupancy or to vacate the place, 
added to his difficulties; and because of all this, he had no 
alternative but to ask for the cancellation of the lease contract, but 
that after the Government had made the necessary adjustments they could 
again talk and negotiate about the lease upon a firmer and lasting 
basis.</p>
  <p>  On November 7, 1946, both administrators, Mrs. Potenciano and 
Tabora wrote a letter (Exhibit 2) to Lazatin informing him that they 
would insist upon his compliance with the terms of the contract.  
Thereafter, Lazatin would seem to have abandoned the premises, and the 
administrators finding it in that state took possession thereof at the 
beginning of January, 1947.</p>
  <p>  In the meantime, this property, presumably, as a result of a 
project of partition was assigned to VALENTIN EDUQUE, a minor child of 
the deceased Jose Eduque, as part of his share in the estate.</p>
  <p>  On October 24, 1947, the present action against Lazatin was filed
 by Valentin through his married sister Elisa Eduque Tabora, acting as 
his guardian, to recover rentals from the month of August up to December
 , 1946, at the rate of P1,500.00 a month, P50,000.00 as liquidated 
damages because of defendant's failure to reconstruct the Prince Theater
 and the apartments, and P2,000.00 as attorney's fees.  After hearing, 
the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered judgment ordering the 
defendant to pay P50,000.00 as liquidated damages, P2,000.00 as 
attorney's fees and the sum of P7,500.00 as unpaid rents or a total of 
P59,500.00, with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the filing of
 the complaint.  Lazatin appealed from the decision and because of the 
amount involved, the appeal was taken directly to this Tribunal.</p>
  <p>  The most important errors assigned by appellant are that the 
lower court erred in not finding that appellant exerted every effort to 
secure the approval of the plans and also in not finding that the 
administrators failed to place him in possession of the premises under 
lease.  The trial court found that although Lazatin presented the plans 
and specifications in the office of the City Engineer for approval and 
for the issuance of the corresponding permit to rebuild and although 
these plans and specifications were referred to the Urban Planning 
Commission through its chairman Mr. Louis P. Croft for recommendation, 
there is no proof as to the action taken by said Commission.  The trial 
court said that the testimony of Lazatin to the effect that he made a 
follow-up of the case with the Planning Commission but that he was 
informed by a Clerk in said Commission that said plans could not be 
approved by the Commission because of the plan to widen Legarda and 
Alejandro VI streets, was unsatisfactory, and that after such alleged 
information, he made no further effort to secure the approval of the 
plans.</p>
  <p>  After a careful examination of the record, including the 
testimony of witnesses, and considering the conditions obtaining in the 
City of Manila at the time, we are inclined to agree with the appellant 
that despite his efforts to secure the necessary building permit for the
 reconstruction, he failed because of the disapproval or unfavorable 
attitude of the Urban Planning Commission toward constructions or 
reconstructions unless they conformed to the plan of widening the 
streets of the City, in this case, those of Legarda and Alejandro VI.  
According to witness Advincula, a building inspector in the Office of 
the City Engineer at the time, presented by appellant, the City Engineer
 at the time, presented by appellant, the City Engineer never issued 
building permits unless it was favorably indorsed by the Urban Planning 
Commission, or unless it had no objection to the location of the 
construction with respect to the planned street line.  This Court is not
 unaware of that practice.  There were many complaints and there was 
much dissatisfaction on the part of owners of buildings destroyed during
 the war.  After liberation said owners wanted to rebuild but the City 
Engineer put obstacles in their way, and in not a few instances actually
 refused to issue the building permits unless the constructions or 
reconstructions were made in accordance with the widening of the streets
 as planned by the Urban Planning Commission.  As a matter of fact, in 
one case, HIPOLITO <i>v.</i> CITY OF MANILA, 47 O.G. (Supp.) p. 365, 
decided on August 21, 1950, the City Engineer refused to issue a permit 
to build a private structure within the lot of the petitioner because 
the latter did not want to move it back to the building line designed 
for the widening of Inverness street in Santa Ana, as planned by the 
Urban Planning Commission.  Because the City had neither expropriated, 
much less paid for the strip affected, we had to order the City Engineer
 through mandamus to issue said permit.  This practice at that time was 
of such public knowledge that the courts might well take judicial notice
 thereof.  And this is exactly what must have happened in the case of 
appellant.  He tried hard to get the building permit from the City 
Engineer but this official refused to issue it because of the plan of 
the Urban Planning Commission to widen Legarda and Alejandro VI streets 
by three meters on each side, and because of the Commission's failure to
 approve, if it did not actually disapprove the plans unless the 
structures were built three meters back from the present street line.  
Of course, neither the City Engineer nor the Urban Planning Commission 
is entirely to blame for the reason that they were concerned solely with
 the technical side of the plan and its execution, not with its legal 
aspect.</p>
  <p>    And to further lend credence to the difficulty encountered by 
the appellant in securing the necessary building permit, we have the 
fact that up to the present time, we have the fact that up to the 
present time, the Prince Theater and the apartments in question have not
 been rebuilt; and this was not due to any lack of effort or diligence 
on the part of the owner or the administrators.  As early as January, 
1947, after the administrators had taken possession of the premises, one
 Atty. Gonzales, counsel for the administrators, inquired from the 
office of the City Engineer about the reconstruction of the Prince 
Theater.  In answer he received a letter (Exhibit T).  According to the 
lower court said letter is proof that the City Engineer was ready to 
issue the permit for the rehabilitation of the Prince Theater.  We, 
however, view it differently.  According to the second paragraph of the 
letter which reads as follows —
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "The rehabilitation of this building is therefore feasible 
provided that the application and plans to be filed in this Office, 
prior to the issuance of the permit would meet with our regulations and 
provisions of the building ordinances as well as to the requirement that
 the National Urban Planning Commission may demand in accordance with 
their plans now under preparation."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>the rehabilitation of the theater was feasible provided that the 
plans would meet the regulations and provisions of the building 
ordinances of the City <u>as well as the "requirement that the National 
Urban Planning Commission may demand in accordance with their plans now 
under preparation</u>." That was the very obstacle that confronted 
Lazatin, and that may be the same reason why until now both the Prince 
Theater and the apartments have not been rebuilt.</p>
  <p>    We see no reason to believe that Lazatin did not exert efforts 
to secure said permit.  He was as much interested as the administrators 
of the estate, in rebuilding the theater and the apartments.  At that 
time most, if not all the movie houses in Manila had been burned or 
destroyed or put out of commission.  The people who had not seen movie 
pictures, at least from the United States, for a long time, and during 
the Japanese occupation, were hungry for them and anxious to see them 
and almost at any price, and many of them had the price because at that 
time, with the money left and being spent by the U. S. Army including 
all its agencies, money was relatively plentiful.  That is the reason 
why all the movie houses were rebuilt almost immediately and ahead of 
residential houses.  Even new movie houses were built.  So, it is not 
hard to see or to imagine that Lazatin, a businessman engaged in the 
show business, must have expected to make a handsome profit by quickly 
rebuilding the Prince Theater and taking advantage of the boom in movie 
exhibitions, during the lifetime of the lease.  Not to be excluded was 
the expected revenue from rentals of the apartments to be rebuilt.  At 
that time, many apartments and residential houses in the City had been 
destroyed and space for dwelling was at a premium.  Rentals were high, 
so much so that the Chief Executive and later the Legislature had to 
curb and regulate them by Executive Order and by legislation.</p>
  <p>    Finding as we do that appellant had done all he could to secure
 the permit and to comply with his obligation to rebuild the Prince 
Theater and the apartments, but because of the refusal of the Government
 authorities to issue said permit, he failed to fulfill his undertaking,
 he should be absolved and released from said obligation.</p>
  <p>    The appellant claims that he had not been placed in possession 
of the premises by the lessors.  It may be true that there may have been
 some occupants who offered objection or even resistance to leaving the 
premises.  But this was not the real reason for the failure of the 
appellant to make the reconstruction.  Before, October, 1946, when he 
decided to rescind the contract of lease, he never complained about not 
being able to occupy the premises.  As a matter of fact, he was able to 
collect rents from some of the tenants.</p>
  <p>    There is evidence to show that although the appellant could not
 rebuild the theater or apartments, he was in possession of the premises
 up to December, 1946, and the administrators did not take possession 
thereof until January 1, 1947.  It is, therefore, but just that 
appellant should be held responsible for the payment of the monthly 
rental up to the end of December, 1946.  Although appellant claims that 
he has paid two months rental for July and August, the preponderance of 
evidence shows that the amount paid was only P1,500.00, for July only.</p>
  <p>    In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby 
modified so that appellant will pay to the plaintiffs only the sum of 
P7,500.00 as rentals from August 1st to December 31, 1946, with interest
 at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the complaint.  No 
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
