				<H3>NARCISO CORTEZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. HERBERT BROWNELL, JR., IN HIS CAPACITY AS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. GUILLERMA ABARQUEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE; REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, INTERVENOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, ACTING C.J:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 4, 1947, in Special Proceeding No. 56 for the summary settlement of 
the estate of the deceased Amario Cortez, the Court of First Instance of Davao 
decreed that Guillerma Abarquez, his mother, was his only legitimate heir, 
entitled to his properties including two parcels of land in the City of Davao, 
described in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 718 of that province. It 
appearing that she was married to K. Matsuo, a Japanese, the court ordered that 
copy of its decree shall be given to the Enemy Property Custodian of the U. S. 
in Davao.
<p>On May 18, 1948, the Philippine Alien Property Administration issued Vesting 
Order No. P-644, (under the authority of the grading with the Enemy Acts, as 
amended, the Philipipne Property Act of 1946 and other legal provisions), 
declaring that said landed property, being owned by a national of Japan, was 
thereby vested in the Philippine Alien Property Administrator for the use and 
benefit of the United States etc.</p>
<p>On January 29, 1951, Narciso Cortez, Filipino, filed a complaint in the Court 
of First Instance of Davao to annul the above judicial decree and Vesting Order 
in so far as one-half of the property was concerned. He alleged in substance 
that he was the lawful husband of Guillerma Abarquez and the father of Amario 
Cortez; that as such father, he was entitled to one-half of Amario's estate; 
that the court decree was void because it had been obtained thru false and 
fraudulent representations, inasmuch as the attorney who had filed the petition 
(Atty. Gonzales) knowing he was alive, asserted that the only heir of Amario was 
his mother Guillerma Abarquez; and that, consequently, the Vesting Order was 
also void, at least in so far as it affected his one-half share of the assets of 
his dead son.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General of the United States, who was substituted as party 
defendant vice the Philippine Alien Property Administrator presented an answer 
opposing plaintiff's demand, denying the alleged fraudulent representations, and 
asserting that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit, because 
under the Philippine Property Act of 1946, a formal notice of claim had to be 
filed with the Alien Property Administration before the institution of a suit; 
and the plaintiff failed to comply with such condition, with the result that the 
action was, in effect, a suit against the United States government without its 
consent. Said defendant also averred that the false representations supposedly 
made to secure the award in favor of Guillerma Abarquez were not sufficient 
cause of annulment, because they did not constitute extrinsic or collateral 
fraud.</p>
<p>The Republic of the Philippines intervened, and made common cause with the 
Attorney-General of the U. S.</p>
<p>Guillerma Abarquez was impleaded as defendant. In her answer, however, she 
prayed that judgment be rendered in accordance with the complaint, acknowledging 
her to be the legal owner of the other half of the property in question.</p>
<p>After hearing both sides, the court declared itself with jurisdiction and 
found no fraud in the procurement of the judicial award, inasmuch as Atty. 
Gonzales came to know plaintiff was alive <em>only after</em> the said award had 
been duly promulgated. Said the court on this point,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is pointed out by the counsel for the plaintiff that fraud was committed 
in the procurement of the questioned Order of this Court in Special Proceedings 
No. 56, claiming that when Atty. Gonzales filed the petition he was advised by 
Corcuera that the plaintiff was alive, and that was one month after Corcuera 
received the power of attorney and the letter accompanying the same. Although 
Atty. Gonzales admitted that he was informed by Corcuera to the effect that the 
plaintiff was alive, yet it was only after March, 1947, when the Order was 
already issued.</p>
<p>Apparently Corcuera was not sure of the date, whereas Atty. Gonzales was 
certain that his knowledge of the plaintiff being alive was only had after 
March, 1947, when the question order was already issued.</p>
<p>Considering that the testimony of Corcuera as pointed out is noticeably 
uncertain with respect to dates, it cannot prevail over the testimony of Atty. 
Gonzales, who gave the exact date that it was in March 1947, when he was advised 
by Mr. Corcuera."</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, the Court granted the relief demanded by plaintiff and his wife 
Guillerma Abarquez, following its opinion that Atty. Gonzales, as an employee of 
the Philippine Alien Property Administration "should have prevented the vesting 
of the properties" by said office, when he got information that Narciso Cortez 
was still alive.</p>
<p>The Attorney-General of the United States and the Republic of the Philippines 
appealed. In their joint brief they contend, in their first two assignments of 
error, that the lower court had no jurisdiction over the Attorney-General nor 
over the subject matter. By reason of such assignments the appeal is here, as 
involving a question of jurisdiction. We do not find it necessary, however, to 
discuss this phase of the controversy, because we are of the opinion that even 
if the court had jurisdiction, the appealed decision must be reversed and the 
complaint dismissed.</p>
<p>According to the Rules, the court order of March 4, 1947 adjudging the 
properties of Amario to his mother Guillerma Abarquez, as his only heir, could 
be annulled or modified to give other heirs (Narciso, the father) their share 
within two years after March 4, 1947. When on January 29, 1951 Narciso Cortez 
began this proceeding more than two years had already elapsed. He knew that 
under the Rules he had no chance; therefore he elected another course of action: 
a direct attack on the ground of fraud, which is made to consist in the alleged 
knowledge (before the institution of the proceeding for the settlement of 
Amario's estate) of Atty. Gonzales that he was living, and despite such 
knowledge, Atty. Gonzales falsely asserted that he (Narciso) was dead. But the 
lower court believed Gonzales' testimony that he came to know Narciso was alive 
<em>only after the award</em> had been promulgated. So, the court found there 
was no fraud in obtaining the Court adjudication. Nevertheless, reasoning that 
after knowing Narciso was alive, Gonzales should have impeded the issuance of 
the Vesting Order, the court annulled both the judicial order, and the Vesting 
Order based thereon. Now, this is a prejudicial <em>non sequitur</em>. In the 
first place it is not shown how Atty. Gonzales could have prevented the 
promulgation of the Vesting Order. He was just an attorney in the office of the 
Philippine Alien Property Administrator. In the second place, no relation 
existed between Narciso Cortes and Atty. Gonzales imposing on the latter the 
active duty to protect the former's interests. In the third place, granting that 
Atty. Gonzales neglected his duty (if any) to prevent the forfeiture, how could 
such neglect nullify the judicial order already issued, and which was final and 
irrevocable?</p>
<p>Now then, if the order of March 4, 1947 cannot be declared null and void by 
reason of a subsequent neglect of duty of Gonzales, how again may the Vesting 
Order be annulled, being—as it is—based upon an outstanding judicial declaration 
that the property belongs to Guillerma Abarquez married to a Japanese, i. e. a 
national of enemy country (Japan)?</p>
<p>Detecting this flaw in the appealed decision, the appellees claim in their 
brief that the lower court erred in not finding that Atty. Gonzales acted 
fraudulently, because "in September 1946, he knew that plaintiff and his son 
Loreto were alive and in Manila, and yet he concealed this fact from the Court 
and misrepresented them to be dead when he filed on January 6, 1947, the 
petition for the summary settlement of the estate of Amario."</p>
<p>This contention is premised on the testimony of Vedasto Corcuera who had 
allegedly told Gonzales in September 1946 that "according to Loreto Cortez his 
father is still living." Atty. Gonzales affirmed under oath that Corcuera gave 
him the information after March 1947. And the court believed him; rightly, 
because Atty. Gonzales was presented as witness <em>by the plaintiff 
himself</em>. Anyway even if it were true that Corcuera spoke to him in 1946, 
Atty. Gonzales could not be blamed in discounting such <em>hearsay</em> 
evidence, in the face of positive information given to him of Narciso's death by 
Ciriaco Cavanes (who had engaged him to file the petition and also by Guillerma 
Abarquez, information which he was justified to believe, since Guillerma's 
marriage to the Japanese could only be explained with her previous husband's 
demise. In any event, the refusal of Atty. Gonzales to believe that Narciso was 
alive does not by any means constitute fraud. Much less does it constitute 
extrinsic or collateral fraud, since his fault, at most was the unintentional 
presentation of false testimony that Narciso was dead; or in the concealment 
(also unintentional) of the fact that Narciso was alive. And we have recently 
ruled that presentation of false testimony or the concealment of evidentiary 
facts does not per se constitute extrinsic fraud, the only kind of fraud 
sufficient to annul a court decision.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Anyway the deception by the Floreses, if any, was intrinsic, being in the 
same category as presentation of perjured testimony or false evidence. Such 
fraud does not prevent application of res judicata. According to repeated 
decisions, only extrinsic fraud in procuring a judgment is ground to nullify 
it." (Arsenio Escudero et al. <em>vs</em>. Gertrudo Flores et als.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> G. R. No. L-7401, June 25, 1955.) (Citing 
many cases.)</p></blockquote>
<p>There is therefore no ground to annul the court's adjudication of March 
4,1947. And so long as it stands, the Vesting Order must also stand.</p>
<p>And this plaintiff has only himself to blame. He was advised on time by Atty. 
Gonzales that amendment of the court decree could be obtained by motion within 
two years, yet he did not take appropriate action. Furthermore he separated from 
his wife for many years (since 1925), and took no legal steps when she was 
living with, or when she married the Japanese, thereby allowing the impression 
to prevail in Davao that he was already dead. He has to bear the consequences. 
</p>
<p>If it be argued that Guillerma's marriage to the Japanese was void, and 
therefore she was not an alien enemy whose property is subject to forfeiture, 
the answer is that according to existing court order, she is married to the 
Japanese K. Matsuo. It should be remembered that under the law then in 
force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Any marriage subsequently contracted by any person during the lifetime of 
the first spouse of such person with any person other than such first spouse 
shall be illegal and void from its performance, unless:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) The first marriage was annulled or dissolved; </p>
<p>(b) The fiirst spouse <em>had been absent for seven consecutive</em> years at 
the time of the second marriage without the spouse present having news of the 
absentee being alive, <em>or the absentee being generally considered as dead and 
believed to be, so by the spouse</em> present at the time of contracting such 
subsequent marriage, <em>the marriage so contracted being valid</em> in either 
case <em>until declared null and void by a competent court</em>." (Sec. 29 Art. 
3613 Civil Code.) (Italics ours.)</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>The appealed decision is reversed, the complaint is dismissed and the 
questioned orders are sustained. Costs against plaintiff-appellee. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion 
</em>and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.,</em> concur. </p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>
