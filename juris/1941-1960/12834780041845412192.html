				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a petition for certlorari to annul an order issued by the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp;&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; in Civil No. 22938,<br><br>That&nbsp; civil case was&nbsp; riled by Ted Lewin and Ray Lewin against Antonio&nbsp;&nbsp; Quirino,&nbsp; Harry Lyons&nbsp; and Arturo Alafriz&nbsp; for the&nbsp;&nbsp; recovery of P12, 500.00,&nbsp;&nbsp; and as security for&nbsp; the&nbsp; satisfaction of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; that might be&nbsp; rendered therein,&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; had preliminary attachment&nbsp; levied&nbsp; on certain properties referred&nbsp; to an&nbsp; the&nbsp; Caledonia Pile,&nbsp;&nbsp; consisting&nbsp; of one&nbsp; lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; tractor crane&nbsp; parts and&nbsp; spare parts&nbsp; owned In common by the defendants&nbsp; in the&nbsp; proportion&nbsp; of&nbsp; two-thirds&nbsp; Tor Antonio&nbsp; Quirino and&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; remaining&nbsp; one-third for Harry Lyons&nbsp; arid Arturo Alafriz.<br><br>At the&nbsp;&nbsp; instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quirino and upon sufficient&nbsp; bond&nbsp; to answer for his&nbsp; share&nbsp; of the&nbsp; obligation sued upon,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; court on June&nbsp;&nbsp; 7, 1954&nbsp; ordered the&nbsp; release&nbsp;&nbsp; of his two thirds&nbsp; share in&nbsp; the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; levied&nbsp; upon,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; for the&nbsp; proper implementation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the order the&nbsp;&nbsp; court&nbsp; later issued&nbsp; another&nbsp; one,&nbsp;&nbsp; dated July 6,&nbsp;&nbsp; directing&nbsp; the&nbsp; division of&nbsp;&nbsp; said properties&nbsp; and releasing&nbsp;&nbsp; to Quirino his two-thirds share&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; But upon receipt of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter order,&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyons,&nbsp;&nbsp; Alafriz and&nbsp; Quirino appeared before the&nbsp;&nbsp; court and&nbsp; submitted the&nbsp;&nbsp; following stipulation&nbsp; for&nbsp; approval:<br><blockquote>“1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; the entire&nbsp; pile&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; tractor and&nbsp; spare parts now in&nbsp; storage&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp; 1930 Bonifacio Drive,&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Area,&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; be&nbsp; placed in&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of Antonio Quirino or his duly authorized representative, with the power to&nbsp; sell&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp;&nbsp; at such price&nbsp; as nay seem most beneficial&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties;&nbsp;&nbsp; provided,&nbsp;&nbsp; however,&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; at least, one-third&nbsp; (1/3)&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the proceeds&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; sole&nbsp; be in cash and&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; balance&nbsp; in&nbsp; terns not exceeding sixty (60) days;&nbsp;&nbsp; provided that If more time&nbsp;&nbsp; is necessary, the&nbsp;&nbsp; same&nbsp; must be with the express writ ten consent&nbsp;&nbsp; of Harry Lyons,&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to the&nbsp;&nbsp; following conditions:<br><br>“(a)&nbsp; The entire&nbsp; proceeds&nbsp; shall be divided&nbsp; into three equal parts,&nbsp;&nbsp; one-third&nbsp; (1/3)&nbsp; t o be delivered to the Sheriff of Manila,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; some&nbsp;&nbsp; to be&nbsp; kept subject&nbsp; to the&nbsp; outcome&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; instant&nbsp; case&nbsp; in&nbsp; no far as it&nbsp; concerns Harry Lyons&nbsp;&nbsp; and Arturo Alafriz; and <br><br>“(b) The&nbsp;&nbsp; two-thirds&nbsp;&nbsp; (2/3)&nbsp; to be&nbsp; retained by Antonio Quirino.<br><br>“It is&nbsp; expressly understood&nbsp; that before&nbsp; any division&nbsp; of the proceeds is made,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponding rentals&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; warehouse";&nbsp;&nbsp; from and&nbsp; after this date, shall be deducted from the said&nbsp; proceeds&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale,<br><br>“It is expressly understood&nbsp; that if&nbsp;&nbsp; the attachment with respect to Harry Lyons&nbsp; and Arturo Alafriz&nbsp; is, at any time,&nbsp;&nbsp; lifted,&nbsp; the one-third&nbsp; (1/3) proceeds of&nbsp; sole&nbsp;&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; directly to the&nbsp; aforesaid Harry Lyons&nbsp; and/or Arturo Alafriz."</blockquote>Forthwith,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; court issued an order,&nbsp;&nbsp; dated&nbsp; sane&nbsp; day,&nbsp;&nbsp; July 6, 1954,&nbsp;&nbsp; approving&nbsp; the above&nbsp; stipulation and enjoining compliance therewith”<br><br>Alleging&nbsp; tint despite the above&nbsp; order Lyons&nbsp; continued&nbsp;&nbsp; to have possession and control of&nbsp; the properties in question and was disposing&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; a largo&nbsp; portion thereof without&nbsp; accounting for its proceeds and that through his&nbsp; reckless negligence a substantial&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; stock had been lost&nbsp; aid&nbsp; stolen, Quirino filed a motion&nbsp; under&nbsp; date&nbsp; of August&nbsp; 26,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; asking that&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; sheriff be&nbsp;&nbsp; ordered to place&nbsp; him in possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the properties&nbsp; and Lyons&nbsp;&nbsp; on his part&nbsp; to be&nbsp; ordered to&nbsp; account for the sales&nbsp; and for properties&nbsp; stolen while&nbsp;&nbsp; in his possession. Answering&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion,&nbsp; Lyons&nbsp; alleged,&nbsp;&nbsp; by way of defense,&nbsp;&nbsp; that he had&nbsp; already&nbsp; on July 7,&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; acquired Quirino's&nbsp; rights&nbsp; to two-thirds&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; properties in question for&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P20,000.00. But at&nbsp; the hearing&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the motion,&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyons failed to appear,&nbsp;&nbsp; allegedly because he&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; then sick arid&nbsp; in the&nbsp; hospital, Aiding the motion well-founded,&nbsp;&nbsp; the court on September 1, 1954&nbsp; issued an&nbsp;&nbsp; order directing: Lyons&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver possession&nbsp; of the properties&nbsp; to Quirino,&nbsp;&nbsp; to render a full&nbsp; accounting thereof,&nbsp;&nbsp; including&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceeds&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sales made&nbsp; by him,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; to deliver two-thirds&nbsp;&nbsp; of said proceeds to Quirino.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; court also designated&nbsp; the&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp;&nbsp; or any&nbsp; of his&nbsp; deputies, to enforce&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; order".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the order having been denied,&nbsp; Lyons&nbsp; filed the&nbsp;&nbsp; present petition&nbsp; for certiorari with injunction,&nbsp;&nbsp; asking&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp;&nbsp; order be&nbsp; declared null and&nbsp; void as having been issued in excess of&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp; and with&nbsp; grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>We&nbsp; find no merit&nbsp; in the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would appear that the&nbsp;&nbsp; last&nbsp; order&nbsp;&nbsp; complained of was only for the&nbsp;&nbsp; enforcement&nbsp; of a previous&nbsp;&nbsp; order rendered&nbsp; at&nbsp; the request of&nbsp;&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; and upon the&nbsp;&nbsp; very terms&nbsp;&nbsp; stipulated by&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; can be no question as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; court&nbsp; to issue&nbsp; that last order,&nbsp;&nbsp; because,&nbsp;&nbsp; though the properties involved had already been ordered released to Quirino,&nbsp;&nbsp; the release was&nbsp; only for the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp;&nbsp; therein specified,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was that&nbsp;&nbsp; of having them converted into cash and having&nbsp; one-third of&nbsp;&nbsp; the proceeds delivered&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; sheriff to&nbsp; answer for the result of&nbsp; the main&nbsp; action&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; so far as&nbsp; Lyons&nbsp; and Alafriz were&nbsp; concerned. Until&nbsp; that purpose&nbsp; had been realized,&nbsp;&nbsp; the properties could not be&nbsp; considered entirely released from attachment so that the&nbsp; manner of&nbsp; their disposition was&nbsp; still subject to the authority of&nbsp;&nbsp; the court,&nbsp;&nbsp; at least&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority of seeing to it that its&nbsp;&nbsp; order wax being&nbsp; complied with.<br><br>Lyons claims&nbsp; that he&nbsp; has&nbsp; already acquired Qiurino's share&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim, is do nisei&nbsp; and&nbsp; it is not supported by any bill of sale or other&nbsp; document.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp; even if what lie&nbsp; claims&nbsp; Is&nbsp; true,&nbsp;&nbsp; he had no right&nbsp; to disobey or&nbsp; interfere with the court's&nbsp;&nbsp; order&nbsp; of July 6,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1954, which was handed&nbsp; dawn at&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; request&nbsp; of&nbsp; himself and his co-owners,&nbsp;&nbsp; without&nbsp; that&nbsp; order&nbsp; having been first revoked&nbsp; or properly modified.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; the petition for certiorari with injunction is denied with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the&nbsp; petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
