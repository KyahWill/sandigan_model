				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The defendant was charged in the Municipal Court of Manila with having orally 
threatened to inflict some bodily harm upon the persons of Martina de Lara, 
Marcela Manucum, Lorenzo Santos, Dolores Bacalso, Anaqureta Diaz and Eugenia de 
Lara, without however showing by his posterior acts that he persisted in his 
threats. The defendant filed a motion to quash, alleging that as the crime was 
committed on July 28, 1955 and the information was filed on September 27, 1955, 
or after 61 days, it had already prescribed in accordance with Article 90 of the 
Revised Penal Code. The Municipal Court dismissed the case, and the appeal taken 
by the Assistant City Fiscal to the Court of First Instance of Manila having 
been also dismissed, the plaintiff has again appealed.
<p></p><p>According to the appellant, the crime charged falls under Article 282, 
paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code; is punished with arresto mayor and a 
fine not exceeding P500.00; and in accordance with Article 90 of the Revised 
Penal Code, prescribes in 5 years. Article 282 refers to an act of threatening 
to inflict upon the person, honor or property of another or of his family any 
wrong amounting to a crime. </p>
<p>The information recited "that on or about 28th day of July, 1955, in the City 
of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, in the heat of anger, did then and 
there wilfully, unlawful and orally threaten to do some bodily harm to the 
persons of Martina de Lara, Marcela Manucom, Lorenzo Santos, Dolores Bacalso, 
Anaqureta Diaz and Eugenia de Lara, the said accused, without, however, showing 
by his posterior acts that he persisted in the idea signified by his 
threats."</p>
<p>Article 285, paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code punishes with arresto 
menor or a fine not exceeding P200.00 "any person who in the heat of anger, 
shall orally threaten another with some harm not constituting a crime, and who 
by his subsequent acts shows that he did not persist in the idea involved in his 
threat, provided that circumstances of the offense shall not bring it within the 
provisions of Article 282 of this Code."</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the information charges light threats defines and 
penalized by Article 285, paragraph 2, and not grave threats contemplated in 
Article 282, paragraph 2. The allegations that the threats was oral and made in 
the heat of anger and that the accused did not by his posterior acts show that 
he persisted in his threat, are descriptive merely of the light offense. It is 
true that the information does not allege that the threatened bodily harm is one 
not constituting a crime, but neither does it allege that it is one amounting to 
a crime. </p>
<p>The appellant is mistaken in the belief that Article 282, paragraph 2, 
provides an alternative fine of not less than P200.00 which is a correccional 
penalty under Article 26 of the Revised Penal Code, because the fine spoken of 
should not exceed P200.00, of from one to two hundred pesos.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed order is affirmed with costs de oficio. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia, </i>and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</p></div>
