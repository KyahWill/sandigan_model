				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When on March 7, 1948, the sheriff of Manila took steps to execute the 
decision of the court of First Instance in civil case number 3527 ordering 
Felipe Aguasin and his wife to leave the premises in Echague Street belonging to 
Jose M. Ocampo, and to cause all "tenants thereon" to vacate the same, the 
herein petitioners Ng Siu Tam et al., — all sublessees of Aguasin occupying the 
premises, — appeared before the court, argued that, not beina parties to the 
aforesaid civil case they were not bound by that decision and moved for a 
declaration to that effect. The court denied their motion in an order dated 
March 13, 1948, which, gave them thirty days to remove their goods or 
merchandise or to take further steps for the protection of their rights. A 
motion to reconsider was likewise denied. Hence thia petition for certiorari 
with preliminary injunction. 
<p>It is undisputed that Jose M. Ocampo, the owner of the premises, has obtained 
a judgment of eviction — which has become final— against his tenants, the 
Aguasins. The latter had subleased the same to herein petitioners, owning and 
operating stores therein. And the sole question is whether the eviction order 
affects them too. We have heretofore decided such question in the affirmative ( 
De la Cruz <em>vs</em>. Roxas 42 Off. Gaz. 458; Gozon <em>vs</em>. De la Rosa, 
L-506 January 30, 1947 44 Off. Gaz., 1225). And very recently we overruled a 
petition for injunction in a quite identical situation ( King Sins <em>vs</em>. 
Geronimo et al., L-2126 ). There is one particular circumstance, which 
apparently induced one member of this court to issue a temporary injunction: the 
allegation that petitioners had concluded an agreement with Ocampo to let them 
retain the premises under the same conditions given to the Aguasins and that 
said petitioners had instituted, in the Court of First Instance of Manila, an 
action to compel Ocampo to abide by his covenant aforementioned. But apparently 
no written contract exists; and respondents, denying the agreement, submitted a 
sworn statement of three of the petitioners expressly admitting, that no such 
contract had ever been made by respondent Jose M. Ocampo. It is, therefore our 
opinion that, as in the King Sing case, herein petitioners may not in this 
proceeding enjoin the execution of Jose M. Ocampo's Judgment. </p>
<p>On the equitable side we observe that petitioners knew the pendency of the 
ejectment preceedings ( Annex C ) and were actually heard in their two motions — 
wherein, strangely enough, they never mentioned their alleged understanding with 
the owner. They have furthermore been accorded fair treatment in the form of 
extension of time to pack up their possessions, and carry them away. </p>
<p>The petition is dismissed and the preliminary injunction will immediately be 
dissolved. Costs in favor of respondents. </p><em>Parás, Actg. C. J., Feria, 
Pablo, Perfecto,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
