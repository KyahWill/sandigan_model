				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In civil case No. 1181 of the Manila Court of First Instance the instant 
petitioner, as plaintiff, claiming to be at the time the occupant of stalls Nos. 
280-283 of the Quinta Market, City of Manila, and upon the other facts alleged 
in her complaint, prayed for judgment declaring her as the true and lawful 
occupant of said stalls, and that pending the action, the therein defendants, 
among whom were the present respondent Manila Mayor Valeriano Fugoso, Judge of 
First Instance Honorable Emilio Peña, the City Health Officer, the market 
administrator, and the market master of Quinta Market, be enjoined from ejecting 
her from said stalls and from committing further "acts of disturbance upon the 
peaceful use and possession" of the stalls aforesaid that she there alleged to 
have enjoyed, and that after trial, the injunction be made permanent. That 
action was in due time tried and decided by the respondent Judge Honorable 
Emilio Peña. The decision (annex 3 of answer) was rendered on January 28, 1947, 
and adjudged that the therein defendant Albina Elizaga was the former lawful 
occupant of said stalls Nos. 280-283 of the Quinta Market, based upon the facts 
found in the same decision and upon resolution No. 50 of the Municipal Board of 
Manila approved on December 12, 1945, and set out in paragraph 7 of the petition 
herein thus:
<blockquote>
<p>"RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ADJUDICATION OF STALLS IN THE CITY PUBLIC MARKETS 
TO ACTUAL OCCUPANTS WHOSE OCCUPATION WAS NOT OBTAINED THROUGH FRAUD, FORCE OR 
MISREPRESENTATION AND WHEN APPLIED FOR NOT LATER THAN OCTOBER 31, 1945, UNDER 
CERTAIN CONDITIONS.</p>
<p>"WHEREAS, as a result of three years of the Japanese Regime, there had been 
many conflicts in the occupation of stalls in the public markets;</p>
<p>"WHEREAS, in the Divisoria Market alone, out of the 2,000 stalls therein, 
about 600 are actual (ly) contested; Now, THEREFORE, be it</p>
<p>"RESOLVED, That with a view to asking a solution to these conflicts, the 
adjudication of stalls in the City Markets (public be given to actual occupants 
whose occupation was not obtained through fraud, force or misrepresentation and 
when applied for not later than October 31, 1945; PROVIDED, That when a stall is 
claimed by one who can satisfactorily prove that he or she was the adjudicated 
occupants of said stalls on December 8, 1941, and had not abandoned the same 
prior to that date, or if he or she had abandoned it for justifiable reason 
after that date, he or she has registered with the City Health Officer on or 
before October 19, 1945, a written claim for is (its) re-occupation his or her 
claim or right shall be preferred it satisfactory proof is presented that the 
abandonment was for really justifiable reasons.</p>

<p>In this proceeding petitioner asks of this Court that the respondents Manila 
Mayor Valeriano Fugoso, Honorable Judge Emilio Peña, the City Health Officer, 
the market administrator, and the market master of Quinta Market "be inhibited 
from the enforcement of the petitioner (possibly petitioner means to say "from 
ejecting the petitioner") from the above-mentioned stalls, and from further 
proceeding in the main case, and in the meantime to issue a preliminary writ of 
injunction against the said respondents. Petitioner complains that the 
respondent Judge acted with grave and gross abuse of discretion in not deciding 
in civil case No. 1181 whether or not the injunction therein prayed for shall 
issue, but instead in setting the hearing of the case on the merits "after a 
passive inaction for more than two weeks from the date of the complaint" 
(petition, par. 9).</p>
<p>The respondents counter (answer, par. 3) that when said court refused to 
issue the preliminary injunction it was because it was not convinced that there 
was sufficient ground for the issuance thereof, "considering the circumstances 
of the case as well as the opposition filed by the defendants therein." It 
should be remembered that one of the instant respondents thus answering the 
petition was the respondent judge himself. The facts found in the decision which 
was later rendered by said court in the main case fully justify the attitude 
taken by it in regard to the plaintiff's petition for a writ of preliminary 
injunction: those facts were, that the defendant Albina Elizaga in the main case 
was the legal occupant of the controverted stalls Nos. 280-283 since the month 
of October, 1941, up to February, 1945; that as a consequence of the battle for 
the liberation of Manila the said stalls became out of order and unsuitable for 
business; and that on October 4, 1945, said Albina Elizaga filed an application 
for the stalls, which were adjudicated to her on May 7, 1946. (<i>See also</i> 
Exhibit 3 of Annex 1.)</p>
<p>Considering the other averments of the petition, commencing with paragraph 10 
to the end thereof, and the answer thereto by the respondents commencing with 
paragraph 4 to the end of the same, we utterly fail to see any showing of an 
abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent judge in refusing to issue the 
writ of preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiff in the main case. As 
early as November 22, 1946, counsel for the therein defendant Albina Elizaga 
filed with the Court of First Instance her petition (Annex 1 of the answer), the 
affidavit of Bienvenido Letrero, and a certified copy of the memorandum of the 
acting administrator of city markets dated June 25, 1946, marked Exhibits 1 and 
2 of the said petition showing that the therein plaintiff, herein petitioner, 
did not present any application for the lease of the stalls in question during 
the period prescribed in resolution No. 50, series of 1945, of the Municipal 
Board. With that petition there was also accompanied a copy of the communication 
of the City Health Officer dated May 7, 1946, whereby the said stalls were 
"regularly assigned" to the said Albina Elizaga subject to the conditions 
specified in her application dated October 4, 1945 (Exhibit 3 of Annex 1).</p>
<p>On top of all this, the main case having in the meantime been decided on the 
merits, and the remedy of appeal having thereby become available to petitioner, 
the present petition has become unnecessary. On the appeal, if taken, petitioner 
as appellant, if she so desires, can file a petition with the appellate court 
asking for the issuance of a preliminary injunction or any other available 
ancillary process.</p>
<p>Wherefore, it is adjudged and decreed that the petition be, as it is hereby, 
dismissed, with costs against petitioner. So ordered.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, 
Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
