				<H3>HUGH M. HAM, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. THE BACHRACH MOTOR CO., INC., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are appeals by both the plaintiff and the defendant to the Court of 
Appeals from a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Manila 
dismissing the complaint, the counterclaim and the defendant's third-party 
complaint against the third-party defendants (civil No. 11159). As only 
questions of law are involved, the Court of Apppeals certified the case to this 
Court.
<p>The facts are not disputed, the parties having entered into a stipulation of 
facts. The facts as stated by the trial court are, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A complaint was filed by Hugh M. Ham against the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., on 
May 24, 1950, which complaint was later amended on June 2, 1955 (pp. 186-190, 
record) which was admitted by the Court on June 11, 1955 (p. 195 record). In the 
amended complaint, the plaintiff prays that the defendant be sentenced to pay 
the former the amount of P30,500.00 together with the legal rate of interest 
thereon from the date of the filing- of the complaint, attorney's fees of not 
less than P5,000.00 and the costs of suit.</p>
<p>On June 8, 1950, the defendant filed its answer, which was amended on June 
24, 1955, filed June 25, 1955 (pp. 196-201, record). The said amended answer 
contains affirmative defenses and a counterclaim for the payment by the 
plaintiff to the defendant of rer.t-1 at the rate of P500.00 a month from 
November, 1949, to June, 1955, in the total cum cf P34,000.0O plus the rental 
for subsequent months.</p>
<p>On June 28 1955, the said plaintiff filed his reply to defendant's 
affirmative defense and counterclaim (pp. 202-208, record).</p>
<p>On September 13, 1950, the defendant Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., filed a 
third-party complaint against the Honorable Secretary of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources, and the Director of Lands (pp. 32-36, record). Said third-party 
complaint (which was allowed on 18 September 1950) prays for the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) That the order dated September 15, 1947, issued by the 
third-party defendants, Director of Lands, with the approval of the other 
third-party defendant Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, copy of 
which was received by the defendant, the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., on March 16, 
1948, cancelling the lease contract of said defendant with the Government 
covering Block No. 146, Reclamation No. 1, Port Area, Manila, Philippines and 
forfeiting in favor of the Government defendant's building and other 
improvements erected thereon, be declared illegal, null and void;</p>
<p>"(<em>b</em>) That the third party defendants be compelled to respect 
defendant's leasehold rights on said parcel of land in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the lease contracts, Appendices 'B' and 'C;</p>
<p>"(<em>e</em>) That the defendant, the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., be recognized 
as owner up to now of the building erected on said parcel of public land;</p>
<p>"(<em>d</em>) That the third party defendants be ordered to recognize as 
valid the contract of lease, Appendix 'D', entered into between the defendant 
and the plaintiff during the period set forth in said contract;</p>
<p>"(<em>e</em>) That the new contract of lease entered into between the 
plaintiff, Hugh M. Ham, and the third party defendants over the same portion of 
defendant's building leased by the defendant to the plaintiff, be declared 
illegal, null and void; and</p>
<p>"(<em>f</em>) For the costs of this action and for such other and further 
relief as this Honorable Court may deem just and equitable in the premises" (pp. 
35-36, record).</p></blockquote>
<p>On October 28 (27), 1954, all the parties herein, plaintiff, defendant and 
third-party defendants, filed "partial stipulation of facts" dated October 27, 
1954 (pp. 109-113, record) quoted as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">PARTIAL STIPULATION OF FACTS</p>
<p>"Come now the parties in the above-entitled case through their undersigned 
attorneys, and to this Honorable Court respectfully submit the following partial 
stipulation of facts, to wit:</p>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p>"That plaintiff is of legal age and a resident of Manila, Philippines; that 
the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., is a corporation duly organized and existing in 
accordance with the laws of the Philippines; with its principal office in 
Manila, Philippines; that the third party defendants, Secretary of Agriculture 
and Natural Resources and the Director of Lands, are the duly appointed and 
acting officers in said positions and are sued, not personally, but in their 
official capacities.</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p>"That on February 26, 1919, a contract of lease, copy of which is attached 
hereto as Exhibit 'A' and made a part hereof, was entered into by and between 
the Government of the Philippine Islands, now the Republic of the Philippines, 
on the one hand, and one Helene Caswell, on the other hand, in virtue of which 
the former leased to the latter for a period of ninety-nine (99) years from said 
date, a parcel of public land known as Block No. 146, Reclamation No. 1, Manila 
Harbor, Manila, containing an area of 4,410 square meters, to be used for 
commercial and business purposes only for and in consideration of a! rental 
fixed at 3% <em>per annum</em> of the appraised value of said parcel of public 
land to be paid semi-annually and in virtue of which, the lessee therein was 
permitted to build, as in fact she built thereon, a building of strong materials 
which subsequently became known as the 'Teal Building';</p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p>"That on May 16, 1935, the defendant, the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., acquired 
through public auction the building known as 'Teal Building' existing on the 
aforementioned parcel of public land as well as whatever and all rights and 
interests which the original lessee might have in the aforementioned contract of 
lease with the Government and said acquisition was duly approved by the Director 
of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources on April 14, 
1939, as per copy of their order dated April 24, 1939, issued in R.L.L.A. No. 62 
(L-36), attached hereto as Exhibit 'B' and made a part of this stipulation;</p>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<p>"That during the battle for the liberation of Manila between the American 
Armed Forces of Liberation, on the one hand, and the Imperial Japanese Forces, 
on the other hand, the building referred to in the next preceding paragraph 
hereof, was damaged;</p>
<p>"That in order to rehabilitate the portion of defendant's building leased to 
him, the plaintiff reconstructed and introduced necessary improvements thereon 
valued at approximately F28,000.00;</p>
<p align="center">V</p>
<p>"That on February 4, 1946, the defendant, the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., 
entered into contract of lease with the plaintiff, copy of which contract is 
attached hereto as Exhibit 'C and made a part hereof, over a portion of 
defendant's aforementioned building, containing an area of approximately 600 
square meters, more or less; that in pursuance with said contract of lease, 
plaintiff has occupied the leased portion of said building and has paid to said 
defendant, the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., the stipulated rental of P500.00 a 
month for the period from February, 1946 up to and including the end of October, 
1949; that the rental corresponding to the months from April, 1948; to October, 
1949, was paid by the plaintiff to the defendant in pursuance with the letter 
dated April 5, 1948 sent to the plaintiff by Attys. Roxas, Picaso and Mejia, on 
behalf of the defendant; that during the period from February 5, 1948 to October 
14, 1949, the plaintiff was also required to pay, as in fact the plaintiff paid, 
to the Bureau of Lands the sum of P2,268.53 for the occupation of the premises 
for the same period; that from November 1, 1949, the plaintiff did not pay 
rental to the defendant because he was required to pay, as in fact he paid, to 
the Bureau of Lands the necessary occupation fees from February, 1948;</p>
<p align="center">VI</p>
<p>"That on September 15, 1947, the third party defendants issued an order, a 
copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 'D' and made a part of this 
stipulation, cancelling the lease contract, exhibits 'A' and 'B' and forfeiting 
the improvements of the defendant thereon in favor of the Government, that copy 
of said order of cancellation and forfeiture was served upon and received by the 
defendant, the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. on March 16, 1948;</p>
<p>"That the parties cannot stipulate as to the validity of said order of 
cancellation and forfeiture, Exhibit 'D', or as to the grounds set forth 
therein, or as to whether or not the defendant was given due notice or due 
hearing before the said order of cancellation and forfeiture was issued and the 
parties leave these matters to be established by their respective evidence;</p>
<p align="center">VII</p>
<p>"That in due time, defendant filed a petition for review and reconsideration 
of the aforementioned order of cancellation and forfeiture, as per copy of said 
petition attached hereto as Exhibit 'E' and made a part hereof; and on June 17, 
1948, the third party defendant, Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, 
issued another order, certified copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 'F' 
and made also a part hereof, denying the said motion for a reconsideration.</p>
<p align="center">VIII</p>
<p>"That in due time, defendant filed another motion for re-investigation of the 
case, copy of which it attached hereto as Exhibit 'C, and made a part hereof, 
but said motion for re-investigation was denied in an order of the third party 
defendant, Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, copy of which is 
attached hereto, as Exhibit 'H' and made a part hereof, which order was based on 
the 3rd Indorsement of the third party defendant Director of Lands, dated 
November 22, 1948, copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 'H-l' and also 
made a part hereof;</p>
<p align="center">IX</p>
<p>"That on January 14, 1949, the defendant through its Vice-President and 
General Manager, interposed an appeal to His Excellency, the President of the 
Philippines, copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit '1' and made a part 
hereof; that in forwarding the said appeal to His Excellency, the President of 
the Philippines, the third party defendants wrote the .second indorsement dated 
May 12, 1949, and the third indorsement dated May 21, 1949, copies of which are 
attached hereto as Exhibits J' and 'J-l', respectively, and made also parts 
hereof.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that the foregoing partial stipulation 
of facts be approved, and that another date be set for the hearing of this case 
in which parties hereto shall present their evidence as to those points in which 
they could not stipulate."</p></blockquote>
<p>The documents and papers marked Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, H-l, I, J 
and J-l, mentioned in the partial stipulation of facts as parts thereof, are 
attached to the said stipulation (pp. 114-169, record).</p>
<p>After the parties had entered into the aforequoted partial stipulation of 
facts, the plaintiff presented evidence in relation to his claim for damages, 
and the defendant waived its right to present additional evidence, (pp. 233-245, 
record on appeal.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court held that since the decision of the Director of Lands dated 
15 September 1947 (Exhibit B), approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Commerce now (Agriculture and Natural Resources), had been appealed to the 
President of the Philippines, and the latter has not yet acted on the matter, 
the aggrieved party has not exhausted all administrative remedies. Hence the 
present action was premature.</p>
<p>The plaintiff seeks, among others, to recover from the defendant the amount 
of P10,500 he had paid to the latter by way of rental from April 1948 to October 
1949, allegedly not due because of the cancellation and forfeiture of the lease 
and the improvement by the Director of Lands, with the approval of the Secretary 
df Agriculture and Natural Resources. The decision of the Director of Lands 
dated 15 September 1947 (Exhibit D) was served upon the defendant on 16 March 
1948. The validity of the plaintiff's claim is, therefore, based upon the 
legality and validity of the decision of the Director of Lands. </p>
<p>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> applicable to judicial review of decisions 
of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources 
is too well known and need not be restated.</p>
<p>The parcel of land in question, a reclaimed land, is of the public domain. 
Its lease and incidents arising therefrom are governed by the provisions of Act 
No. 1654 and Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, otherwise known as the Public 
Land Act. Under the contract of lease entered into by the defendant's 
predecessor-in-interest and the Director of Lands in behalf of the Government, 
"for a breach of any of the covenants herein by the said party of the second 
part, save those covenants for breach of which special provision is made, the 
said party of the first part may elect to declare this lease forfeited and void, 
and, after having given thirty (30) days' notice, in writing, to the said party 
of the second part, may enter and take possession of the said premises, and said 
party of the second part hereby covenants and agrees to give up the possession 
thereof" (Exhibit A). The decision of the Director of Lands cancelling the 
contract of lease in question is appealable to the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Section 2(d), Act 
No. 1654, partly provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lease of the said lands shall be executed by the Director of Lands and 
approved by the Secretary of the Interior (now Agriculture and Natural 
Resources) and shall specifically provide, among other things, * * * that in 
case of failure * * * to comply with any or all of the terms and conditions of 
said lease the same shall thereupon be forfeited (referring to the buildings and 
improvements), and that all improvements made on the leased property shall vest 
in and become the property of the Government of the Philippine Islands; 
<em>Provided, however</em>, That the Governor-General (now President of the 
Philippines) may, in his discretion, and upon such terms as he may prescribe, 
waive the forfeiture herein provided for, or extend the time within which said 
improvements shall be commenced and completed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the aforequoted provision of Act No. 1654, the forfeiture of the 
improvements declared by the Director of Lands with the approval of the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, is subject to review by the 
President of the Philippines. Moreover, by virtue of the President's power of 
control over all executive departments, bureaus or offices<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which "means the power of an officer to 
alter, modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the 
performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that 
of the latter,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the President may 
reverse, affirm or modify the decision of the Director of Lands and the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. By its own act of appealing from 
the decision of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources to the President of the Philippines, and without waiting for 
the latter's decision, the defendant cannot complain if the courts do not take 
action before the President has decided its appeal.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against both 
appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em> 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed</em>.</p>
