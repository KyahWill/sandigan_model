				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Review of a Court of Appeals' decision calling for interpretation or
application of articles 366 and 372 of the Civil Code, which are quoted
in the margin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  <p>
Way back in 1928, the Pampanga River running East to West, separated
the land of Felipe Buencamino, Jr. from the lots of Maria Bolandos and
others (herein described as plaintiffs). These lots in Cabiao, Nueva
Ecija, were registered under the Torrens System, except that of
plaintiff Juan Magbag. In 1954, when the complaint was filed in this
case in Nueva Ecija, the Pampanga River was still flowing East to West
but no longer in its 1928 bed. Its waters were then running about 387
meters farther to the south.</p>
  <p> It seems that Buencamino's
agents claiming that his land extended south up to the (new) bed of the
Pampanga River, took possession of the portion (north of the River) of
the lots of plaintiffs, asserting ownership through accretion (Art.
366, Civil Code). Wherefore, the present action. As Buencamino
subsequently sold his property to Salvador Crespo, the latter was
substituted as sole defendant.</p>
  <p> After hearing the parties,
the court of first instance found for defendant. However, the Court of
Appeals reversed, holding there had been no accretion, but a change or
changes in the course of the Pampanga River effected during the years
1943 to 1945. Said the Appellate Court:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"*
* * Ya queda indicado que, segun la teoria de los demandantes el cambio
de cauce del rio de Pampanga, tuvo lugar durante tres años desde 1943,
mientras que el demandado sostiene que esta mutacion ha sido paulatina
y comenzo desde el año 1928."</p>
    <p>"Hemos examinado con cuidado
las pruebas de las partes sobre esta cuestion de hecho, y entendemos
que la preponderancia de las pruebas demuestra que la mutacion de cauce
del rio de Pampanga, tuvo lugar en el periodo indicado por los
demandantes. * * *"</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> On the basis of the
above findings, the Appellate Court declared that plaintiffs had lost
no part of their properties, inasmuch as there had been no such slow
and gradual accretion, beginning in 1928, as defendant claimed.
Therefore, it required defendant Crespo to surrender the portion in
question and to pay damaged in the amount of P1,000.00 per year
beginning 1954.</p>
  <p> In this Court, Salvador Crespo alleges it
was error not to apply the principles of accretion, inasmuch as "it is
not to be disputed" "that the Pampanga River had been eroding its
southern bank for the last several years or since 1923 * * * hence the
erosion was gradual" (p. 8 petitioner's brief). But the Court of
Appeals declared specifically that there was no such <i>gradual erosion since 1928</i>.
It expressly rejected the plaintiffs' theory on that particular point;
and we are bound by its findings of fact. For this reason, we see no
merit to petitioner's contention that the controversy should be decided
in the same way Cañas <i>vs.</i> Tuason<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> had been decided. For one thing, the land therein disputed had <i>been transferred</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to the other side of the Mariquina river by <i>gradual erosion</i> occurring during the <i>period of thirty years</i>; whereas here, the Pampanga river <i>had shifted its course</i> during floods occurring three or four times a year during <i>the period between 1943 to 1945</i>. In the circumstances, we believe it proper to apply the provisions of Art. 372 as the appellate court did.</p>
  <p>
When for the first time the flood moved the Pampanga River into the
lots of the plaintiffs, the bed thus newly; covered by its waters
became property of public ownership. But when the next flood
transferred the river bed farther south into plaintiffs' lands, they <i>ipso facto</i>
recovered the bed they had first lost, even as the new bed on their
property accrued to the public domain. And thus the automatic process
of recovering and losing river beds continued until the year 1945, when
apparently the River stopped its wandering movements to settle into its
present location—thereby segregating a part of plaintiffs' property,
without affecting their title.</p>
  <p>    The thing to remember is that the portions in dispute were admittedly part of the lots of plaintiffs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>,
and that defendant Crespo (or his predecessor) never acquired them
through "gradual erosion and consequent deposit of alluvial soil
imperceptibly taking place since 1928," because there was no such
erosion as found by the Court of Appeals.</p>
  <p>    The decision under review must accordingly be affirmed, with costs against petitioner. It is so ordered.</p>

receive from the effect of the current belong to the owners of the
estate bordering thereon. <br>
  <br> ART. 372.—Whenever a navigable
or floatable river changes its course from natural causes and opens a
new bed through a private estate, the new-bed shall be of public
ownership, but the owner of the estate shall recover it in the event
that the waters leave it dry again either naturally or as the result of
