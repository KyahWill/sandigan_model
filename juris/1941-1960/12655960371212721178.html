				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When Mayor Fidencio Latorre of Villareal, Samar, departed for Manila on official business early in the morning&nbsp; of September 22, 1952, he designated the herein defendant Francisco Hilvano,&nbsp; councilor, to discharge the duties of his office.&nbsp; Later, during office hours on that same day, Vice-Mayor Juan Latorre went&nbsp; to the municipal building; and having found Hilvano acting in the place&nbsp; of the Mayor, he served written notices to the corresponding municipal officers, including Hilvano, ihat he (Juan Latorre) as Vice-Mayor was assuming the duties of the absent mayor. However, Hilvano refused to yield,&nbsp; arguing that he&nbsp; had been&nbsp; designated by the Mayor.&nbsp; Whereupon the&nbsp; Vice-Mayor sent&nbsp; a telegram&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Executive Secretary informing&nbsp; the latter of the controversy.&nbsp; And the said Secretary replied by letter,&nbsp; that under sec. 2195&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; Vice-Mayor who should discharge the duties of the Mayor during the latter's temporary absence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shown&nbsp; this official pronouncement, Hilvano&nbsp; still&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to surrender&nbsp; the position.&nbsp; Again the Vice-Mayor sought the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal,&nbsp; who by letter&nbsp; (Exhibit D),&nbsp; replied&nbsp; that the Vice-Mayor had the right to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding such opinion which was exhibited to him—Hilvano&nbsp; declined to vacate the post, which&nbsp; he held for&nbsp; about a month,&nbsp; appointing some policemen, solemnizing marriages and&nbsp; collecting the corresponding salary for&nbsp; mayor.<p>Wherefore&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; Hilvano&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; prosecuted—and—after trial—was convicted of usurpation of public authority under Republic Act No. 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; appealed in due time. The&nbsp; Solicitor-General&nbsp; and appellant's counsel&nbsp; agree that the penal provision&nbsp; applicable to the case is Republic&nbsp; Act No. 379&nbsp; which&nbsp; amended Art.&nbsp; 177&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code&nbsp; to&nbsp; read as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>Usurpation of authority or official functions</em>.—Any person&nbsp; who shall knowingly and falsely represent himself to be an officer, agent or representative of any department or&nbsp; agency&nbsp; of the Philippine Government or of any&nbsp; foreign government, or who, under pretense of official&nbsp; position, shall perform any act pertaining to any person in authority or public officer of the Philippine Government or of any foreign government, or any agency thereof, without being lawfully entitled to do so, shall suffer the penalty of prision correctional in its minimum and medium periods.'"</p></blockquote><p>It is contended however for the appellant that he committed no usurpation of authority because he was a councilor, an official of the Government, and that such crime may only be committed by private individuals.&nbsp; He cited a decision of&nbsp; the Supreme Court of Spain&nbsp; of 1880 interpreting the corresponding&nbsp; article of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Spanish Penal Code, which is the origin of our own Penal Code/&nbsp; But it appears that in subsequent decisions the same court convicted of&nbsp; the offense of usurpation certain officials who without proper authority discharged the functions of other officials, e.g.,&nbsp; a municipal judge (Jan. 22, 1890)&nbsp; and&nbsp; a vice-mayor (teniente de alcalde) who discharged the functions of the&nbsp; alcalde.&nbsp; (Oct.&nbsp; 15, 1891).&nbsp; See&nbsp; Viada&nbsp; 5th Ed.&nbsp; Vol. IV pp.&nbsp; 227-230. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p>There is actually no reason to restrict the operation of Article 177 to private individuals.&nbsp; For one thing it applies to "any person"; and where the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish.&nbsp; Furthermore, contrary to appellant's&nbsp; assumption that&nbsp; Articles 238-241&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code penalize&nbsp; all kinds of usurption&nbsp; of official functions by public&nbsp; officers, said articles merely punish interference by officers of <em>one of the three departments</em> of government (legislative, executive and judicial) with the&nbsp; functions&nbsp; of&nbsp; officials of&nbsp; another department. Said articles do not cover usurption of one officer or employee of&nbsp; a given&nbsp; department of the&nbsp; powers of <em>another</em> officer<em> in the same</em> department.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the exercise by a bureau employee of the powers of his director.</p><p>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; excuse for&nbsp; defendant-appellant.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the beginning he might have pleaded good faith, invoking&nbsp; the designation by the Mayor;&nbsp; but after he had been&nbsp; shown the letter of the Executive Secretary and the opinion of the provincial fiscal, he had no&nbsp; right thereafter stubbornly to stick to the position.&nbsp; He was rightfully convicted.&nbsp; But the penalty impossed on him should be modified, in accordance with the recommendation of the Solicitor General.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is sentenced to&nbsp; an indeterminate term of 4 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> to two years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional.</span>&nbsp; So modified, the appealed&nbsp; judgment is affirmed with costs against appellant.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
