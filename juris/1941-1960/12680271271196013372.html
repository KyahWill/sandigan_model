  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(Acknowledgment)</p>
      </blockquote>

  <p>(Exhibit B, pp. 22-23, Record on Appeal.)<br> 
  (Civil No. 410 of the Municipal Court of Davao)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 3 December 1951, another action was filed for the recovery of the
same amount as the sought to be recovered in the previous case. After
hearing, the Municipal Court of Davao City rendered judgment ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P1, 739.96, together with lawful interest from the date of filing of the complaint until paid, P100 attorney's fees and costs.&nbsp; From that judgment defendant appealed to the Court of First Instance.</p><p>In his answer the defendant reiterated his allegations and affirmative defenses set up in the Municipal Court. A pre-trial was held and the parties
agreed to submit the case for decision on the pleadings—the original
contract Exhibit A, dated 24 November 1948, and the subsequent Exhibit
B, dated 13 March 1950. The parties were required to file memoranda and
after the filing thereof the Court rendered judgment dismissing the
complaint with costs against the plaintiff. The plaintiff has appealed.</p>
<p>The appeal is before us because there is no question of fact
involved but only the interpretation to be given to the agreement
Exhibit B.</p>
<p>The plaintiff relies on the second paragraph of the agreement quoted
above. If such paragraph is to be construed as making the defendant
responsible for damages for the delay under the previous contract, then
the subsequent agreement upon which the plaintiff asked for the
dismissal of the former case would be meaningless. The defendant
complied with his obligation under the new contract by repairing the
Diesel Engine, putting it in good running condition at the earliest
possible time, and, as directed by the plaintiff, set it up at the
place of the purchaser Juan Peña in Tibungko, Davao City, after keeping
it in his place for some time by express direction of the plaintiff
while the latter is negotiating for the sale thereof. The only
reasonable interpretation of the second paragraph is that should be
defendant fail to repair, put the Diesel engine in good running
condition at the earliest possible time and install it at any place
that the plaintiff may direct, without any further obligation on the
part of the latter, the last part not having been assumed by the
defendant in the original contract, then only then would the
defendant’s liability for damages arise. Since the defendant has
performed fully and satisfactory his part of the contract, the
plaintiff has no cause of action against him.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with double costs against the appellant</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion </em>and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.,</em> concur </p>
<p><em>Mr. Justice Montemayor</em> took no part.</p></div>
