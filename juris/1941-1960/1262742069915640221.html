				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal, taken by defendant Andres A. Arenga, from a  decision  of the Court of First  Instance  of Iloilo. The appeal was forwarded to this Court by the Court of   Appeals, the jurisdiction of the lower court being questioned by said  appellant. <br><br>It appears that on  October 29, 1947, William and  Alejandro Repospolo purchased from C. N.  Hodges, in the City of Iloilo,  a Chevrolet truck for P5,000, of which P1,500 was paid on said date.  It was stipulated that the  balance of P3,500 would be paid on instalments at the  rate  of P300 a month from November 1947, except the last instalment, which would be P200.  The Repospolos  executed the deed Exhibit A,  which  incorporated this agreement and provided, also, that the obligation  would draw interest at the rate of 1 per cent a month and that, in case of default, they would pay the additional sum of P500, by way of attorneys' fees and cost of collection. To guarantee compliance with the  obligation,  William Repospolo  constituted  a  chattel mortgage  on said truck.            <br><br>By September 7,  1948, the balance outstanding in favor of  Hodges,  after  deducting the  payments  made by  the Repospolos, was Pl,810.  On said date, William Repospolo sold the truck  to Andres A. Arenga, Alfredo Suello and Mauricio La-anan for P1,000.   One-half of this  sum was then paid  in cash.  The buyers signed  a promissory note for the balance, payable not later  than December 31,  1948, and, to  guarantee  the  same, a real  estate belonging  to Arenga  was given  "as  security."   The  "Contract of Sale with Guaranty", Exhibit 3, executed  for this  purpose,  in Dueñas, Iloilo, provided also: <br><blockquote>"That the above described CHEVROLET truck has an outstanding obligation with C. N.  Hodges, of the City of  Iloilo, in the sum of ONE THOUSAND EIGHT  HUNDRED TEN PESOS (P1,810), Philippine Currency, plus interest of 1 per centum per month as  of 3 August 1948, which is hereby agreed by the parties that the Party of  the Second Part shall assume full responsibility to said  obligation  by paying fully to said Mr. C. N. Hodges  the monthly obligations  until fully paid plus the interests due; <br><br>"That with this sale, the Party of the Second Part shall be  the true and lawful owners of said truck and shall assume full control of the same subject, of course, to the rights of the said  Mr. C N. Hodges  until and  after the obligations are  fully paid." </blockquote>Thereafter, said  buyers  and William  Repospolo  went to the  City of Iloilo, and  secured the  approval  of this transaction by Hodges.  On this occasion, Andres A. Arenga signed  at  the  foot of  Exhibit A, the  original  contract between Hodges and the Repospolos.  Moreover,  Arenga's name was written on Exhibit 2—which  is  a page of the book of accounts of  Hodges in connection with Exhibit A—in  lieu of the name of William Repospolo, which originally  appeared thereon and was  then crossed out.  Subsequently,  Hodges  received  payments made by Arenga aggregating P410, thereby leaving a balance of P1,400 due on  the truck in  question.  In   addition thereto, Arenga had, on several occasions,  obtained from  Hodges  goods worth  altogether P887.49.   Neither sum  having paid,  on March  8,  1950,  Hodges instituted  the  present action against William and Alejandro Repospolo and Andres A. Arenga to recover said sums  of P1,400 and P887.49, plus P500,  as attorneys' fees, and  the  costs.   After due trial, the Court of First Instance of Iloilo rendered judgment sentencing Arenga to pay to Hodges said sums of P1,400, P500,  and P887.49, with interest, at the rate of 1 per cent a month, from  November 28,  1949 (date of the last payment  made on account of the  truck), as regards the first two (2)  amounts,  and from March 8,  1950, as to  the  last sum, and the costs, and  dismissing the complaint insofar as the Repospolos are concerned, upon  the ground that they had been substituted by Arenga as debtors to Hodges, with  the latter's  consent  (expromision),  and that  the credit of Hodges against the  Repospolos  had been extinguished thereby.  The issues raised by appellant  Arenga are:  (1) whether the lower court had  jurisdiction  over this case, and  (2), whether he is liable  for the  amounts above  mentioned. <br><br>With  respect to the first  question, Arenga maintains that this case was not within the jurisdiction of the lower court,  because plaintiff Hodges alleged, in his complaint, three  (3) causes  of  action:  the  first,  for P1,400,  plus P500,  as  attorneys' fees: the  second,  for  P860;  and  the third,  for P27.40.   There is no merit in this pretense,  for a  court of first instance  has original jurisdiction "in all cases in which  <span style="font-style: italic;">the demand</span>,  exclusive of interest *  * * amounts to  more  than Two Thousand Pesos." (Rep. Act No. 296, section 44 [c].)   The demand, in the case at bar, is the <span style="font-style: italic;">sum total</span> of the amount claimed in  the  three  (3) causes of action—which is over P2,000—not in  each cause of  action, separately from the  others. (Gutierrez  vs. Ruiz, 94 Phil., 1024; 50 Off Gaz., 2480; Soriano vs. Omila, 97 Phil., 62;  51  Off. Gaz., [7], 3465.) <br><br>As regards the  second  question,  appellant  maintains that, under  the  contract  of sale with guaranty,  Exhibit 3,  he had assumed, not alone, but together with  Alfredo Suello  and  Mauricio La-anan,  the  obligation to pay to Hodges the sum of Pl,810,  plus  interest, and no  more; and  that  Exhibit  3  contains  no stipulation  relative to the payment of attorney's fees.   However, Exhibit 3 specifically  stipulates, that the  buyers under said  deed  "shall be the true and lawful owners" of  the truck  in question "and shall  assume control  of the same, <span style="font-style: italic;">subject of course, to the  rights of said Mr. C. N. Hodges,"</span> which rights are defined in  Exhibit  A, pursuant to  which Hodges  is entitled,  in case of default, to  attorneys' fees, with interest thereon. That Arenga had,  likewise, agreed to, and did, assume this obligation is clearly evinced by the fact that <span style="font-style: italic;">he affixed  his  signature at  the foot of said  Exhibit A.</span> Although Arenga declared  that such  was not his intention when  he  signed Exhibit  A, the  lower court  evidently found  such testimony  unworthy of credence, and we find no reason to hold otherwise.  On the contrary, considering that he is an ex-mayor of the municipality of Dueñas, it is inconceivable that he would  have acted as he  did without full knowledge of its implications. <br><br>Likewise, although, insofar  as William  Repospolo  is concerned,   the  obligations of  Arenga  under  Exhibit 3 were not  exclusive,  but joint  with  Alfredo  Suello and Mauricio La-anan,  the juridical relations between Arenga and  Hodges are governed, also, by Exhibit A, not merely by inference from Exhibit 3,  but,  also, by direct  agreement between both, resulting from the fact, among others, that Arenga had signed Exhibit A.   Indeed, the property given  as  security  in  Exhibit  3  belonged  exclusively  to Arenga, although the principal obligation under said deed, was  joint  with Suello  and  La-anan, insofar  as William Repospolo  is concerned.  At any  rate, having signed Exhibit A, without the concurrence of Suello  and La-anan, the  necessary  conclusion is  that  Arenga had agreed, insofar as Hodges is concerned, to assume the responsibility alone.  This, of course, is without prejudice to such  action, if any—on which we express no opinion—as Arenga may  have against  his  co-buyers,  Alfredo  Suello  and  Maurieio La-anan. <br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant Andres  A,  Arenga.   It is so ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L.,  Endencia</span>,  and  <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ., </span>concur.<br><br></div>
