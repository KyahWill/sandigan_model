				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>On March 24, 1946, Luciano Aizon was found killed in his house in the sitio 
of Calanasan, Curuan, City of Zamboanga, and, somewhere in the vicinity of the 
house, his wife Perfecta Contemplado. When the authorities came to investigate, 
it was found out that goods and personal belongings have disappeared and a trunk 
was found open, abandoned nearby the house.
<p>At about six o'clock p.m. of said day, Agustin Bonifacio arrived in front of 
the house and near the stairs he saw two persons. Without suspecting anything 
wrong, he proceeded towards the kitchen, and upon nearing it, he heard Perfecta 
address Janahudin Pakah: "It is up to you, what you want to get." But upon 
seeing Bonifacio, Janahudin unsheated his bolo and chased him. Bonifacio ran 
away and went to the police station of Curuan. There he met Fortunato 
Evangelista, a policeman, and with the latter and five others, he repaired to 
the house of Luciano, who was found by them in the kitchen dead with a severe 
cut on his neck. Early the following morning, the peace officers found in a 
banana grove in a nearby hill the dead body of Perfecta with a wound across the 
lower part of the body towards the neck. The peace officers found disorder 
inside the house. Pillow cases were scattered around, and outside the house they 
found an empty trunk forcibly opened. Upon data furnished by Agustin Bonifacio 
and Eduardo Contemplado, the following were found missing: clothes for men and 
women worth P300; jewelries worth P120; cash of P500; one .22 caliber shotgun 
valued at P110. The latter was recovered, and the total value of the things not 
recovered amounts to P985.</p>
<p>Nine persons, including appellant, were prosecuted for robbery in band with 
double homicide. After the evidence for the prosecution was presented, the case 
was dismissed as against four, and after the hearing, the remaining accused were 
acquitted, with the exception of appellant who was sentenced to <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of Luciano Aizon in the amount of 
P2,000 and the heirs of Perfecta Contemplado in the amount of P2,000 and to pay 
one-ninth of the costs.</p>
<p>The evidence on record justifies the lower court's judgment : finding 
appellant guilty. Even accepting his testimony to the effect that he was forced 
to make his confession, Exhibit D, and that the same must be disregarded, there 
is evidence on record to prove conclusively appellant's direct participation in 
the crime, although no one saw him actually killing either one of the deceased 
couple. His conduct at the time Agustin Bonifacio was proceeding towards the 
kitchen, around which Perfecta Contemplado made an unusual address to appellant 
who, upon seeing Agustin, chased him with his bolo, would show to any reasonable 
person that appellant is responsible for the crime evidence of which was found 
the same night by Agustin Bonifacio, Policeman Portunato Evangelista and five 
others in the disorder in the house and in the dead body of Luciano Aizon.</p>
<p>Shotgun, Exhibit I, one of the articles missing from the house of the crime, 
was found in appellant's house. When he was arrested, upon investigation, he 
readily admitted having killed Luciano Aizon and surrendered at the same time 
his blood-stained bolo and its scabbard. At the arraignment before the Acting 
Municipal Judge of the City of Zamboanga, appellant pleaded guilty. His 
allegation that he did it through fear deserves no credit, as he was already 
under the protection of the court before which he could have complained of the 
danger of being maltreated or tortured if he would fail to plead guilty.</p>
<p>The prosecution suggests that the lower court erred in appreciating against 
appellant the aggravating circumstance that the crime was committed "by a band, 
as according to the evidence only two of the malefactors were armed. The 
contention is correct, as to appreciate said circumstance, Article 14 of the 
Revised Penal Code requires that there should be more than three armed 
malefactors. The prosecution proposes that the aggravating circumstance of 
dwelling should be considered instead. There being no evidence that the offended 
party has not given provocation, which is an essential element of the 
circumstance as provided by No. 3 of Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code, the 
proposal cannot be accepted.</p>
<p>There is no question that the mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction 
should be considered in favor of appellant, although it can not affect the 
result.</p>
<p>As the appellant is guilty of robbery with homicide, the lower court acted 
correctly in sentencing him to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, the penalty provided 
by Article 294, No. 1, of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Article 63, No. 
3, of the same Code. As suggested by the prosecution, the appellant should be 
also ordered to pay the heirs of the deceased espouses the sum of P985. With 
this modification the appealed judgment is affirmed, with costs</p>
<p><em>Paras, Actg. C.J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</em> and 
<em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
