				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is before us on petition for review by certiorari of a decision of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal facts are set forth in said decision, from which&nbsp; we&nbsp; quote: <br><blockquote>"In the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Tarlac, Asuncion&nbsp; Lim&nbsp; filed an action&nbsp; against&nbsp; Roque&nbsp; Velasco for the recovery of two parcels of land, lots 2525 and&nbsp; 2632 of the Cadastral Survey of Paniqui, described&nbsp; in detail in her&nbsp; complaint, on the&nbsp; ground that she is the registered&nbsp; owner thereof,&nbsp; as evidenced by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 6912 (for Lot&nbsp; No. 2525)&nbsp; and 6909 (for Lot No. 2632). Defendant duly filed his answer.<br><br>"The case was heard on September 14, 1951, at the trial plaintiff appeared&nbsp; with her counsel; defendant did not. appear, although his counsel Atty.&nbsp; Ludivico&nbsp; Arciaga,&nbsp; appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff adduced&nbsp; her evidence,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; which it appears&nbsp; that Lot&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2525&nbsp; was originally registered as the conjugal property&nbsp; of the Chinese spouses Lim Tiongco and Ong Uy, as shown by Original Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 19634,&nbsp; issued in accordance with the decision of January 10, 1924 in Cadastral Case&nbsp; No. 29, G.L.R.O. Record&nbsp; No. 279&nbsp; (Exhibit E, first sheet), while Lot&nbsp; No. 2632 was registered as the&nbsp; conjugal property of the same spouses, as evidenced&nbsp; by Original&nbsp; Certificate of Title No. 1881&amp; issued by virtue of the decision of&nbsp; April 2, 1934, in Cadastral&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; G.L.R.O. Record&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 369 (Exhibit E, second sheet).&nbsp; In 1926,&nbsp; Ong Uy died intestate in&nbsp; China; on November&nbsp; 7, 1927, her husband&nbsp; Lim&nbsp; Tiongco died intestate in&nbsp; Paniqui, Tarlac. On&nbsp; December 20,&nbsp; 1848, plaintiff Asuncion Lim, who claims to be their daughter, executed a document of&nbsp; declaration of heirship and&nbsp; extra judicial succession, Exhibit D, and&nbsp; adjudicated&nbsp; to herself as supposed lone&nbsp; heir of the spouses Lim Tiongco and Ong&nbsp; Uy the two&nbsp; parcels of land in question. Upon the registration of Exhibit D, Original Certificates&nbsp; of Title Nos. 19634&nbsp; and&nbsp; 18816 were cancelled, and,&nbsp; in&nbsp; their place, Transfer Certificates of Title&nbsp; Nos, 6912 (Exhibit A) and 6909 (Exhibit&nbsp; B), respectively, were issued in&nbsp; the name of Asuncion Lim.<br><br>"From plaintiff's evidence it further appears that in&nbsp; 1942, defendant&nbsp; Roque Velasco,&nbsp; claiming the&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; of the&nbsp; aforesaid two parcels&nbsp; of&nbsp; land, took possession thereof against plaintiff's consent and since that time had been excluding plaintiff from the possession and&nbsp; enjoyment of the same.<br><br>"On September 20, 1951, the lower court rendered judgment ordering defendant to vacate the two parcels of land&nbsp; in question and to deliver their possession to plaintiff, and to&nbsp; pay to&nbsp; the latter the owner's share&nbsp; in&nbsp; the products of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; during&nbsp; his possession thereof.&nbsp; On October 8, 1951, defendant filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration, which the court denied for lack of merit.&nbsp; On November 26,1951, upon motion of plaintiff,&nbsp; the court issued an order for the issuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; execution.<br><br>"On December&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; defendant, through a different counsel, Atty. Teotimo&nbsp; Duque,&nbsp; filed a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; relief&nbsp; from judgment, which&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; opposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearing&nbsp; of said&nbsp; petition for relief from judgment was scheduled&nbsp; for February 9, 1952.&nbsp; On December 5, 1952, plaintiff,&nbsp; through&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp; asked that the continuation of the hearing&nbsp; on the petition, scheduled&nbsp; for December 15, 1952, be postponed to some other date.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court denied plaintiff's motion.<br><br>"On December 17, 1952, the court set aside its judgment of September 20, 1951 and ordered the case included in its January calendar for hearing on the merits.&nbsp; With leave of court, defendant&nbsp; Roque Velasco, on&nbsp; January 7,&nbsp; 1953, filed a third-party complaint against Juan Fernando, alleging that&nbsp; after the two&nbsp; parcels of&nbsp; land were delivered to plaintiff in accordance with the court's&nbsp; decision of September 20, 1951, said Juan Fernando, in connivance with plaintiff and&nbsp; with full knowledge of the litigation involving&nbsp; said lots, took possession of Lot&nbsp; No. 2632, on the&nbsp; pretention that he purchased it from plaintiff.&nbsp; Third-party defendant Juan Fernando duly answered Roque&nbsp; Velasco's&nbsp; third-party complaint.<br><br>"On&nbsp; June 29, 1953, Agustina Fernando, Maria Fernando,&nbsp; Fausta Fernando&nbsp; and&nbsp; Cornelia Fernando,&nbsp; through&nbsp; their&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion for intervention, which defendant Roque&nbsp; Velasco vigorously opposed.&nbsp; On August 4, 1953, the court&nbsp; denied the motion for intervention&nbsp; on the ground that the intervenor's alleged interests are amply&nbsp; represented&nbsp; by&nbsp; their&nbsp; father Juan&nbsp; Fernando,&nbsp; third-party defendant herein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Intervenors moved for the reconsideration&nbsp; of the court's order, alleging&nbsp; that third-party defendant Juan Fernando should not&nbsp; have been brought&nbsp; into&nbsp; the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; because he&nbsp; is not the real&nbsp; party&nbsp; in interest,&nbsp; inasmuch as it&nbsp; was they, intervenors, and not said Juan&nbsp; Fernando, who&nbsp; bought Lot&nbsp; No. 2632&nbsp; from plaintiff Asuncion Lim.&nbsp; The court&nbsp; denied intervenors' motion&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; inasmuch as&nbsp; their alleged right over lot No. 2632 was derived from plaintiff Asuncion Lim, said right is therefore&nbsp; subject to the result of the case between Asuncion Lim and Roque Velaseo.<br><br>"From the evidence presented by defendant&nbsp; at the trial, it appears that&nbsp; in 1923, he began working as tenant of&nbsp; Eduardo Butac on the two&nbsp; parcels of land&nbsp; aforementioned.&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1928, he&nbsp; purchased from Eduardo&nbsp; Butac&nbsp; a portion of 8,794 square meters of Lot No. 2632 (Exhibit 9).&nbsp; The portion he bought is indicated in the&nbsp; subdivision plan (Exhibit 10) as Lot No. 2632-A.&nbsp; From 1928 up to September 20, 1951, when&nbsp; the two parcels of land in question were delivered to plaintiff Asuncion Lim by virtue of the writ of execution issued by the lower court,&nbsp; defendant Roque Velasco had been in the continuous, uninterrupted, open an adverse possession of the same, as owner of the portion indicated as Lot No. 2632-A and as tenant of Eduardo Butac&nbsp; of the rest of&nbsp; Lot No.&nbsp; 2632 and of the whole of Lot 2525.&nbsp; With respect to plaintiffs claim that&nbsp; she is the only daughter of the spouses Lim Tiongco and Ong Uy, defendant presented evidence to show that she is not daughter of said&nbsp; spouses but that she is the legitimate daughter of Julian Capistani and Ambrosia Bautista, and therefore does&nbsp; not have any successional right to the two parcels of land in question.<br><br>"On April 29, 1954,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court rendered its decision,&nbsp; dismissing both the complaint of Asuncion&nbsp; Lim against Roque Velasco and the&nbsp; third-party complaint against&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Fernando, declaring defendant entitled to the possession of the lands in&nbsp; question, requiring the receiver to&nbsp; render an accounting of his receivership of the two lots and ordering plaintiff Asuncion Lim to account to the defendant for all the products she had obtained from the lots in question from the time the&nbsp; sheriff delivered&nbsp; their possession to her up&nbsp; to the time the receiver was appointed."<br></blockquote>On appeal taken by Asuncion Lim and Agustina,&nbsp; Maria, Fausta and Cornelia, all surnamed&nbsp; Fernando, the Court of Appeals, in due course,&nbsp; affirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the present petition, filed by said appellants, for review by certiorari of the decision of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The main&nbsp; question for determination in&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal is whether plaintiff Asuncion Lim is entitled to divest defendant Roque Velasco of his possession of&nbsp; the land in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; The former asserts&nbsp; that she is,&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; she is the registered owner of said land, as evidence by Transfer&nbsp; Certificates of&nbsp; Titles Nos.&nbsp; 6912 and&nbsp; 6909, issued&nbsp; in her&nbsp; name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the other hand, the latter maintains that she is not:&nbsp; (1) because he owns part&nbsp; of Lot No. 2632, and the rest thereof, as well as Lot&nbsp; No. 2525, belong to Eduardo Butac and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; because, at any rate, said transfer certificates&nbsp; of title were improperly&nbsp; issued in the name of Asuncion Lim, for she is neither a daughter nor an heir&nbsp; of the original registered owners, the spouses Lim Tiongco and Ong Uy. <br><br>As indicated above, Roque Velasco claims to have taken possession of the lots in question in 1923, when he allegedly began working&nbsp; thereon as tenant of Eduardo Butac; that in 1928, the latter sold to&nbsp; him a portion of Lot No. 2632 (indicated in the Subdivision Plan, Exhibit 10, as Lot No.&nbsp; 2632-A)&nbsp; of about 8,794&nbsp; square meters; and that, thereafter, he held said portion of 8,794 square meters, as owner thereof, and remained in possession of the rest of Lot No. 2632 as well as&nbsp; of the entire&nbsp; Lot No. 2525, as tenant&nbsp; of Eduardo Butac,&nbsp; until he&nbsp; (Roque)&nbsp; was ousted therefrom by the sheriff in obedience to the writ of execution&nbsp; issued pursuant to the order of November 29, 1951;<br><br>Upon the&nbsp; other hand, it is not disputed that Lots Nos. 2525 and&nbsp; 2632 were originally registered in the name of the spouses Lim Tiongco and Ong Uy, in whose favor Original Certificates of Titles Nos. 19634 and&nbsp; 18816,&nbsp; were issued, pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; final decisions rendered on January 10, 1924 and April 2, 1934, respectively,&nbsp; in Cadastral Case No. 29, G.L.R.O.&nbsp; Record No.&nbsp; 279, and&nbsp; Cadastral&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 27, G.L.R.O. Record&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 369, from whom Asuncion Lim claims to have derived her title, as daughter and sole heir of said spouses, upon their demise.&nbsp; Considering that said original certificates of title are now incontestable, and that the alleged title of Roque Velasco and Eduardo Butac is not derived from, but antagonistic to, and&nbsp; (if Velasco's pretense were true) older than, that of the aforementioned spouses, it becomes obvious that Velasco's claim—to the effect that he owns&nbsp; part of Lot No. 2632, and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; remaining portion thereof, as well as Lot No. 2525 belong to Eduardo Butac (who has not even tried to intervene in&nbsp; this case and&nbsp; establish his&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; title&nbsp; in and&nbsp; to said&nbsp; lots)—is barred by the decisions in the land registered cases above mentioned and, hence, absolutely untenable.<br><br>It is urged, however, by Roque Velasco—and the Court of Appeals, as&nbsp; well as the court of&nbsp; origin sustained his pretense—that Asuncion Lim is not entitled to the possession of the&nbsp; land in question, because she&nbsp; is&nbsp; neither&nbsp; a daughter, nor an heir, of&nbsp; said original registered owners, the spouses Lim Tiongco and Ong Uy.&nbsp; On the other hand, Asuncion Lim&nbsp; impugns the&nbsp; right&nbsp; of Roque&nbsp; Velasco to question her&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; with said&nbsp; spouses,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the ground that they are strangers to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; His reply to&nbsp; this objection—and&nbsp; the theory&nbsp; underlying&nbsp; such&nbsp; reply&nbsp; was adopted by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals—is that, as possessor of said land, he is entitled to hold it as against Asuncion Lim, unless she proves her right thereto, and&nbsp; that she has no such right, for&nbsp; the reason already adverted to.<br><br>At the outset, it should be noted that the rights&nbsp; of "possessors," regulated in Title V of Book II of the Civil Code of the Philippines,&nbsp; entitled "Possession", are those of possessors as <i>owners</i>, not those of persons who hold lands as <i>tenants of another</i>.&nbsp; According to Velasco's theory, he does not hold the land in question as owner, except as to a portion of Lot No. 2632 of about 8,794 square meters.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest thereof and the totality of Lot&nbsp; No. 2525&nbsp; belong to Eduardo Butac,&nbsp; whose tenant Velasco claims to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, he may not&nbsp; invoke the rights of a&nbsp; "possessor"—in&nbsp; the technical sense of the term—as regards said Lot No. 2525 and&nbsp; the rest of Lot No. 2632.<br><br>Independently of the foregoing, the existence of Transfer Certificates&nbsp; of&nbsp; Title Nos.&nbsp; 6912&nbsp; and 6909,&nbsp; admittedly covering Lots Nos. 2525 and 2632, in the name of Asuncion Lim, suffices to establish her title to said lots and her right, as owner thereof, to its possession.&nbsp; The issue whether or not she obtained said transfer certificates&nbsp; of title&nbsp; illegally of fraudulently—as contended by Velasco—by&nbsp; pretending to be a daughter and heir of Mr. and Mrs. Tiongco, is&nbsp; one which&nbsp; may raised&nbsp; only&nbsp; by those whose&nbsp; rights as&nbsp; heirs, assigns or&nbsp; privies to said&nbsp; original owners may have been injured&nbsp; in consequence&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp;&nbsp; illegality&nbsp; or&nbsp; fraud. Strangers, or persons whose rights are not derived from said original owners, have no right to assail&nbsp; the validity of said transfer certificates of title or the regularity of the issuance thereof.&nbsp; No wrong, of any kind whatsoever, has been done to them, and, hence, they have no cause of action, or right to vindicate, in connection therewith.<br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; judgment appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is hereby reversed, and&nbsp; another&nbsp; one shall&nbsp; be entered&nbsp; declaring that Asuncion Lim and her successors in interest&nbsp; are entitled to the possession of the land in dispute and to&nbsp; the owner's share&nbsp; in the&nbsp; products thereof,&nbsp; and sentencing Roque Velasco&nbsp; to pay to them&nbsp; the value of said share in the aforementioned products,&nbsp; while he was in&nbsp; possession of said land,&nbsp; and, accordingly,&nbsp; let the&nbsp; record of this&nbsp; case be remanded to the court&nbsp; of&nbsp; origin&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding liquidation&nbsp; and accounting by&nbsp; Roque Velasco&nbsp; and&nbsp; the receiver,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against said&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
