				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Moros Ali and others were charged in the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga 
with the crime of robbery in band with physical injuries. The only accused 
apprehended were Moros Ali, Jawad and Ausalin who, after trial, were found 
guilty and sentenced to reclusion perpetua and to return the articles stolen and 
not recovered in the amount of P8,341.00, with legal accessory penalties. The 
three accused have appealed. The appeal of Moros Ali was dismissed by this Court 
because he had escaped from the provincial jail, while the appeal of Moro 
Ausalin had been withdrawn. We have thus before us only the appeal of Moro 
Jawad.<p></p>
<p>While the commission of the crime charged is not in effect questioned, 
appellant Jawad contends that the evidence identifying him as one of the 
offenders merits no consideration for the following reasons; (1) If witness 
Maria Tobel had really known him as a customer of the store in question, why did 
she not immediately reveal his identification when the crime was investigated in 
the morning after its commission, and why did she have to wait until another 
crime was committed and investigated? (2) Witness Florita Cabiligno did not have 
a clear mind at the time she allegedly saw the appellant, and she was in a state 
of confusion because of the gunshot wound. (3) Witness Lim Ih Eng could not have 
seen the appellant because at the very first opportunity when the house was 
ransacked, he escaped away; and if he had really seen the appellant because the 
latter used to buy from the aforesaid store, why did he not point to the 
appellant during the investigation of the crime? It is also argued that his 
defense of alibi is corroborated and strengthened by evidence which was not 
rebutted; that Jaji Mora, a tenant in a coconut plantation, and Rogelio la Chica 
both testified that the appellant was with them on the night of the crime in 
another place, unshelling coconuts; that even appellant's co-accused testified 
not only that they did not know him but that he was not with them on the night 
of the robbery.</p>
<p>The issue thus refers to the sufficiency of the evidence identifying 
appellant Jawad as one of the offenders. The records reveal that Lim Ih Eng and 
Maria Tobel knew the appellant because the latter used to buy cigarettes and 
sugar from them; that in the evening in question they saw him in a room lighted 
not only by a lamp but also by the flashlights the robbers used in ransacking 
the nooks and corners of the house; that the malefactors were not masked. We 
have carefully examined and studied the entire evidence and are convinced that 
the appellant had been sufficiently identified.</p>
<p>The delay in incriminating the appellant should not militate against the 
validity or competency of the supporting proof. It is reasonable to suppose that 
said delay was due to the fact that it was only on March 28, 1953, that Maria 
Tobel again saw the appellant since the date of the crime, considering that a 
person may know another without being able to fully describe him. The witnesses 
in this case had to see and be confronted with the person of the appellant in 
order to identify him. Thus, when Maria Tobel saw the appellant pass by with a 
police officer for investigation for another crime, she readily recognized him 
as one of the participants in the crime committed in the store in question. It 
is noteworthy that the witnesses have not been shown to harbor any grudge or 
prejudice against the appellant.</p>
<p>We find, however, that the penalty imposed by the lower court is erroneous. 
The leg injury inflicted on Florita Cabiligno required hospitalization for more 
than 30 days. Said physical injury is covered by paragraph 4 of Article 363 of 
the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, the robbery committed should be punished in 
accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 394. The proper penalty is <u>prision mayor</u> 
in the maximum period to <u>reclusion temporal</u> in its medium period, which must be 
imposed in the maximum degree, because there are three aggravating 
circumstances, namely, nightime, dwelling, and abuse of superior force, without 
any mitigating circumstance.</p>
<p>Wherefore, it being understood that appellant Moro Jawad is sentenced to 
undergo imprisonment for an indeterminate period of not less than 8 years and 1 
day, <u>prision mayor</u>, and not more than 14 years, 10 months and 21 days, <u>reclusion 
temporal</u>, the judgment appealed from is in all other respects affirmed with 
costs against said appellant. So ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, 
Montemayor, Reyes, A., Baustista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Endencia,</i> and<i> Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</p></div>
