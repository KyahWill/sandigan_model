				<BR><STRONG>BOCOBO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> On December&nbsp; 17,1937,&nbsp; defendant-appellant herein, Rowel Tiangco,&nbsp; who&nbsp; was&nbsp; then a&nbsp; minor&nbsp; under&nbsp; eighteen years&nbsp; of age, pleaded guilty to an information for homicide through reckless negligence, in that he had recklessly driven an auto- mobile and thereby caused the&nbsp; death of&nbsp; Mateo&nbsp; Magtibay, of whom plaintiffs-appellees are the lawful heirs. The Court of First Instance of Batangas found Rowel&nbsp; Tiangco guilty as charged, but&nbsp; as he was under eighteen years of age, the sentence was suspended, and he was committed to the care and custody of&nbsp; Attorney&nbsp; Gavino&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Abaya, until Tiangco would reach his majority, subject to the supervision of the Superintendent of Public Schools of the Province.&nbsp; A&nbsp; little over one year and a half later, on July 27,&nbsp; 1939,&nbsp; Attorney Gavino S. Abaya in&nbsp; view of Rowel Tiangco's good conduct, recommended the dismissal of the&nbsp; case.&nbsp; The Court of First Instance&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; the criminal&nbsp; case, but reserved&nbsp; such right as the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased might have to recover damages in a civil action against said Tiangco.&nbsp; Accordingly, the civil action in the instant case&nbsp; was filed on September 2,&nbsp; 1941, against defendant-appellant herein,&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages in&nbsp; the sum of P2,000 for the death of Mateo&nbsp; Magtibay.&nbsp; The Court of&nbsp; First Instance gave judgment for plaintiffs&nbsp; for P2,000 as damages. Hence this appeal.<br><br>We believe the court <i>a quo</i> committed no error in rendering judgment for plaintiffs.&nbsp; The suspension of the sentence under article 80 of the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; after appellant herein had pleaded guilty, did&nbsp; not&nbsp; wipe out his guilt,&nbsp; but merely&nbsp; put off the imposition of tjie corresponding penalty, in order to give the delinquent minor a chance to be reformed.&nbsp; When, therefore, after he&nbsp; had observed good conduct, the criminal case was dismissed, this did not mean that he was exonerated from the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; charged, but&nbsp; simply that he would suffer no penalty.&nbsp; Nor did such dismissal of the criminal case obliterate his civil liability&nbsp; for damages. The Court of First Instance of Batangas in dismissing the criminal case correctly reserved the right of plaintiffs herein to bring a civil action for damages.<br><br>Counsel for&nbsp; defendant-appellant&nbsp; contends that a minor can not be held civilly liable for his acts.&nbsp; However, whether we view&nbsp; the present civil action as&nbsp; one under the Penal Code or under&nbsp; the Civil Code, defendant-appellant is liable in damages.&nbsp; If the theory of&nbsp; the&nbsp; civil action is civil liability arising from the crime of homicide through reckless negligence,&nbsp; defendant-appellant is&nbsp; bound to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; damages because article 100 of the Revised Penal Code provides that "Every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable."&nbsp; Defendant herein&nbsp; was found guilty of the crime of homicide through reckless negligence.&nbsp; The suspension of the sentence did not exculpate him from the crime, as already stated.<br><br>If,&nbsp; on the other hand,&nbsp; the theory&nbsp; of the civil&nbsp; action is <span style="font-style: italic;">culpa aquiliana</span> or tort, the minority of defendant-appellant does not free him from responsibility for damages because article&nbsp; 32, paragraph&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code provides that "La menbr edad, la demencia 6 imbecilidad, la sordomudez, la prodigalidad y la interdiccion civil no son mas que restricciones de la personalidad juridica.&nbsp; Los que se hallaren en alguno de esos estados son susceptibles de derechos,&nbsp; y aun de obligaciones cuando estas nacen de los hechos&nbsp; 6&nbsp; de relaciones&nbsp; entre los bienes&nbsp; del&nbsp; incapacitado&nbsp; y&nbsp; un tercero,"<br><br>Manresa&nbsp; says&nbsp; that said article 32 renders minors liable-for <i>culpa aquiliana</i> under article&nbsp; 1902, Civil Code.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (See his. comment on Article 32.)&nbsp; Moreover, it is established&nbsp; that "Liability of an infant in a civil action for&nbsp; his torts is imposed&nbsp; as&nbsp; a mode, not of punishment, but of compensation. If property has been destroyed or other loss occasioned by a wrongful act, it is just that the loss should fall upon the estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; the wrongdoer rather than&nbsp; on that of&nbsp; a&nbsp; guiltless person, and that without reference to the question&nbsp; of moral guilt.&nbsp; Consequently, for every tortious act of violence or other&nbsp; pure tort, the&nbsp; infant&nbsp; tort-feasor is&nbsp; liable in a&nbsp; civil action to&nbsp; the injured person in the same manner&nbsp; and to the same extent as an adult"&nbsp; (27 A.J., p 812.)<br><br>The judgment appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Yulo,&nbsp; C. J., Moran, Horrilleno, Ozaeta</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Paras, JJ.,</i>concur.</div>
