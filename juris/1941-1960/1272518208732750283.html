				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner&nbsp; asks for review of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals' resolution&nbsp; annulling the decisions&nbsp; signed by Judge Anatolio C. Mafialac in&nbsp; three criminal cases&nbsp; of the Sorsogon court of first&nbsp; instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ground for&nbsp; the annulment was its finding that said decisions had&nbsp; been promulgated on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1954 when Judge&nbsp; Maiialac no longer presided said district, the Hon. Genaro Tan Torres having qualified as&nbsp; judge thereof on the first&nbsp; day of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same month.<p>The facts are the following: "It appears that&nbsp; on February 5 and 7, 1954, the&nbsp; provincial fiscal of Sorsogon filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; each of the above-entitled&nbsp; cases an information charging the accused, Silvestre&nbsp; Domalaon, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; violation of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 145.&nbsp; The&nbsp; accused having entered the plea of not guilty&nbsp; on arraignment, hearings on&nbsp; the merits were had in said cases before the Honorable&nbsp; Anatolio&nbsp; Manalac,&nbsp; then the judge&nbsp; presiding&nbsp; over the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sorsogon, who,&nbsp; after&nbsp; the cases were submitted,&nbsp; reserved his&nbsp; decisions.</p><p></p><blockquote>"Shortly after&nbsp; these cases had been&nbsp; submitted for decision, Judge&nbsp; Manalac, who&nbsp; since&nbsp; March 4, 1954&nbsp; had filed an application&nbsp; for retirement&nbsp; under the provisions of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 660, went on&nbsp; terminal leave of absence.&nbsp; He&nbsp; was,&nbsp; however, duly authorized by the Honorable,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Justice,&nbsp; to decide in the&nbsp; City of Manila the cases&nbsp; he had tried in&nbsp; Sorsogon which were pending decision.<p></p><p>"In the meantime, Judge Maiialae wrote the Honorable, the Secretary of Justice, a letter asking that favorable action be taken&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; application&nbsp; for&nbsp; retirement,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; it&nbsp; be made effective on September 13, 1954.&nbsp; The Secretary of Justice indorsed this&nbsp; letter to the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; Service Insurance System with a favorable recommendation.</p><p>"On June 21,&nbsp; 1954, His&nbsp; Excellency, the President&nbsp; of the Philippines,&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; the Honorable Genaro&nbsp; Tan Torres <span style="font-style: italic;">ad interim</span> Judge of the 10th Judicial District,&nbsp; to preside&nbsp; over the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of Sorsogon. Judge Tan Torres accepted&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointment and&nbsp; on&nbsp; July 1, 1954, qualified and&nbsp; assumed office&nbsp; as judge of the Court of First Instance of said province.</p><p>"Under the authority granted him to decide in Manila the cases he had pending decision, Judge Manalac drafted his judgments in these cases, placed them in an&nbsp; envelope addressed to the&nbsp; Clerk of Court of&nbsp; Sorsogon, and deposited said&nbsp; envelope in the Manila&nbsp; Post Office on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1, 1954.&nbsp; This envelope was received&nbsp; in&nbsp; the office of the clerk&nbsp; of court of&nbsp; Sorsogon on July 3, 1954, and the judgments therein contained bearing date of June 12, 1954, duly signed by Judge Manalac, were promulgated in&nbsp; said court on the same date.&nbsp; the accused appealed from&nbsp; said judgment of conviction."</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Speaking thru Justice&nbsp; Natividad, the&nbsp; appellate court declared that&nbsp; the authority of Judge Manalac to decide those three cases ended on July&nbsp; 1, 1954, i.e., upon the qualification&nbsp; of the new&nbsp; judge,&nbsp; and that as the&nbsp; judgments were&nbsp; promulgated on July&nbsp; 3, 1954 they were&nbsp; not valid nor binding,&nbsp; in&nbsp; line&nbsp; with several decisions of this Supreme Tribunal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p>Questioning this&nbsp; resolution, the Solicitor General points out that according&nbsp; to&nbsp; Rodriguez <em>vs.</em> Commission on Election,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> promulgation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment "means delivery of&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; to the clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; court&nbsp; for&nbsp; filing and publication",&nbsp; and that&nbsp; when on July&nbsp; 1 Judge Manalac deposited his&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; in the Manila Post&nbsp; Office,&nbsp; addressed to the clerk of&nbsp; court of Sorsogon, the judgments were thereby promulgated on&nbsp; said date&nbsp; and should&nbsp; be considered valid, indulging of&nbsp; course,&nbsp; the presumption that Judge&nbsp; Manalac forwarded them before&nbsp; Judge Torres'&nbsp; assumption&nbsp; of the office.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; argument must&nbsp; be held&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; without juridical&nbsp; foundation.&nbsp; As&nbsp; appellee's counsel maintain,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to specific&nbsp; legal provisions (section 9 Rule 124),&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; signed by Judge Manalac&nbsp; was "to&nbsp; be filed in the court as of&nbsp; the day the same was received by the&nbsp; clerk" namely, as of July 3, 1954. The receipt,&nbsp; not the sending, constitutes the filing.&nbsp; Now then, if&nbsp; in the eyes of&nbsp; the law the decisions were filed on&nbsp; July 3,&nbsp; they could&nbsp; not have been promulgated&nbsp; on July&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Promulgation&nbsp; takes&nbsp; place after&nbsp; the&nbsp; clerk&nbsp; receives the decision and&nbsp; enters&nbsp; it in the criminal, docket. (Cea <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Cinco, 50 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 5254).&nbsp; It must be remembered that in courts&nbsp; of first instance,&nbsp; the promulgation of judgments in criminal proceedings&nbsp; does not necessarily coincide&nbsp; with the day they were delivered by the&nbsp; judge to the clerk&nbsp; for promulgation.&nbsp; The accused or his&nbsp; attorney must&nbsp; be notified&nbsp; first; and&nbsp; then&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"SE. 6.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Promulgation&nbsp; of judgment.</span>â€”The judgment&nbsp; is&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; by&nbsp; reading the judgment or&nbsp; sentence&nbsp; in&nbsp; the presence of the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; and&nbsp; the judge&nbsp; of the court who has rendered it.</p><p>The&nbsp; defendant must be&nbsp; personally present&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; conviction is for a grave or less grave offense; if&nbsp; for light offense, the judgment may be pronounced in the presence of his attorney or representative.&nbsp; And when the judge is absent or outside of the province, his presence is not necessary and&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; may be promulgated or read to the defendant by the clerk of court."&nbsp; (Rule 116).</p></blockquote><p></p><p>Accordingly,&nbsp; the principles, of construction would&nbsp; be unduly strained, were we to&nbsp; hold that Judge Manalac's decisions have&nbsp; been promulgated on July&nbsp; 1, upon being mailed to the clerk of court.</p><p>The doctrine in Barredo <em>vs.</em> Commission on Elections, invoked by appellant, is not persuasive, because it refers to promulgation of decisions of this court, wherein Rule 116 above-quoted has&nbsp; no application.</p><p>We have&nbsp; then&nbsp; that,&nbsp; legally,&nbsp; the decisions of&nbsp; Judge Manalac were promulgated on&nbsp; July 3, 1954.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore, because he had left the&nbsp; Bench before&nbsp; that date,&nbsp; his&nbsp; decisions have no binding effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p>The possibility has&nbsp; been&nbsp; explored of upholding Judge Manalac's authority by&nbsp; adopting the theory that, as he had applied for&nbsp; retirement "effective&nbsp; September&nbsp; 1954", he could&nbsp; not have been&nbsp; replaced&nbsp; before that date, therefore Judge Torres had been appointed&nbsp; and qualified prematurely,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he was&nbsp; still judge,&nbsp; at least&nbsp; on July 3, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such&nbsp; line&nbsp; of&nbsp; approach&nbsp; would&nbsp; expedite judicial business&nbsp; except that it would imply illegality&nbsp; of Judge Torres' appointment&nbsp; and qualification,&nbsp; which the prosecution does not suggest, perhaps because Judge Manalac did&nbsp; not object to his&nbsp; earlier retirement,&nbsp; having urged approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; his resignation&nbsp; "as&nbsp; soon&nbsp; as&nbsp; convenient". Here is part of his letter&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; C)&nbsp; to the Secretary of Justice:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"After a survey of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opportunities open to&nbsp; a&nbsp; private&nbsp; endeavor in&nbsp; Manila even under limited&nbsp; circumstances, I&nbsp; beg to reiterate my&nbsp; request for optional&nbsp; retirement under the provisions of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 660&nbsp; and to insist&nbsp; that&nbsp; it be&nbsp; acted upon favorably as soon as&nbsp; convenient,&nbsp; so&nbsp; that my&nbsp; said retirement may take effect&nbsp; immediately after&nbsp; the exhaustion of&nbsp; all the leave&nbsp; I am at present enjoying and which&nbsp; will&nbsp; expire&nbsp; on September 14, 1954." * * *</blockquote><p>This leads to another&nbsp; objection to the&nbsp; theory of premature qualification: It was not debated m the lower court; and defendants might claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; if&nbsp; it had been so debated they&nbsp; could&nbsp; have proved&nbsp; Judge Manalac's consent to&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp; earlier release.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; the&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; ia against&nbsp; illegality of the appointment.</p><p>In consequence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; considerations, the appellate court's ruling on the&nbsp; validity of the&nbsp; decisions must be, as&nbsp; it is hereby&nbsp; affirmed.</p><p>These&nbsp; cases will be returned to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Sorsogon for&nbsp; adjudication.&nbsp;&nbsp; No new&nbsp; trial shall be held; the&nbsp; judge presiding that court&nbsp; will decide on the strength of the evidence already&nbsp; introduced.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
