				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. E. C. CAÃ‘ADA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For having sold on June 19, 1945, two combs at twenty-five centavos each, the 
defendant and appellant was convicted by the municipal court of the City of 
Zamboanga of a violation of Executive Order No. 24, as amended by Executive 
Order No. 28, of the President of the Philippines, and sentenced to pay a fine 
of one hundred pesos, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, plus 
the costs. Upon appeal to the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga, the 
appellant filed a motion to quash the information, on the ground that, under 
Executive Order No. 62, of August 14, 1945, amending Executive Order No. 24, as 
amended by Executive Order No. 28, a comb is not included among the articles 
with fixed ceiling prices, and that as the later Executive Order is faborable to 
the appellant, the same should be applied. This motion ot quash was denied. Upon 
arraignment, the appellant entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to fifteen 
days of <i>arresto menor</i> and to pay the costs. The appellant has again 
appealed, although his counsel merely argues that the appealed judgment should 
be modified so as to impose only a minimum fine.
<p>Upon the other hand, the Solicitor General recommends appellant's acquittal. 
This recommendation is correct. We agree with the Solicitor General that the 
appellant cannto be convicted of a violation of Executive Order No. 24, as 
amended by Executive Orders Nos. 26 and 28, because a comb is not included in 
the list of commodities for whcih maximum prices are fixed therein. It is true 
that there are certain items in Executive Order No. 62 (which repeals all 
executive orders in conflict therewith) which may be construed as comprising 
combs, but appellant's conviction cannot be predicated on said Executive Order 
No. 62 which was promulgated only on August 14, 1945, or subsequent to the sale 
by the appellant, on June 19, 1945, of the two combs in question. Besides, the 
information charges a violation of Executive Order No. 24, as amended by 
Executive Order No. 28.</p>
<p>The appealed judgment is therefore reversed and the appellant acquitted, with 
costs <i>de oficio</i>. So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
