				<H2>SECOND DIVISION</H2>
				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1497, November 25, 1947</h4>
				<H3>JOAQUIN R. BOGAYONG, PETITIONER, VS. CONRADO SANCHEZ, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>HILADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Respondents Juan D. Salvador, Remigia Z. Salvador, Alfredo Javellana, and 
Gloria S. Javellana being purchasers pendente lite of the premises involved in 
civil case No. 1870 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, an ejectment case, 
became plaintiffs therein in substitution for Lucia Y. Matias Vda. de Tinio, 
former plaintiff therein in substitution for Oceanic Commercial, Inc., original 
plaintiff in the same case. Petitioner was the defendant in that case. The said 
premises are numbered 1127-1129, Rizal Avenue, Manila, and are destined for 
commercial purposes and used by petitioner in his business.
<p>The case had been appealed to the Court of First Instance from the Municipal 
Court of Manila (being Civil Case No. 2540 of the latter court). The municipal 
court had rendered judgment in the case on February 10, 1947, disposing as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * finding that the defendant (herein petitioner) failed to pay the 
corresponding rents for the months of September, October and November, 1946, and 
should, therefore as he is hereby ordered to vacate the premises in question and 
restore the possession of the same to the plaintiff; ordering said defendant to 
pay the rents due for said months at the estimated reasonable rate of P450 a 
month, and to pay at the same monthly rate such other rents as may be due until 
he actually vacates the premises; and to pay the costs * * *.</p></blockquote>
<p>As already stated, and while the case was pending in the Court of First 
Instance by reason of the appeal interposed by petitioner from the 
aforementioned judgment of the municipal court, the instant respondents above 
named became the last substitute plaintiffs. That substitution was prayed for by 
said respondents in a motion dated June 10, 1947, filed by them with the Court 
of First Instance for said purpose and at the same time for the purpose of 
praying, as they actually did, for the execution of the judgment above referred 
to on the ground that the defendant, now petitioner, failed to pay or to deposit 
with the court any amount for rentals which, by the said judgment, he had been 
ordered to pay. Four days thereafter, to wit, on June 14, 1947, the court, His 
Honor Conrado Sanchez presiding the corresponding branch, granted said motion 
both as to the substitution and the execution prayed for therein, in the words 
and figures following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon consideration of the motion filed by Lucia Y. Matias Vda. de Tinio in 
connection with a similar motion filed by Juan D. Salvador, Remigia Z. Salvador, 
Alfredo Javellana and Gloria S. Javellana, which last motion prays first, that 
the latter be substituted as parties plaintiff in lieu of Lucia Y. Matias Vda. 
de Tinio, and second, for the execution of the judgment appealed from, and it 
appearing that as to the first prayer of the motion <i>counsel for the defendant 
has no objection</i> and it further appearing that as to the second point raised 
in the motion <i>upon proper admission of counsel for the defendant the said 
defendant has not deposited the rentals in Court in accordance with the 
provision of section 8, Rule 72 of the Rules of Court,</i></p>
<p>"Both petitions granted,</p>
<p>"Let a writ of execution issue directing the defendant to vacate the 
premises, the subject of this suit." (Italics ours).</p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner now complains against the respondent judge having granted the 
prayer for execution in the same order as the prayer for substitution, alleging 
as reason for his complaint that at the time the prayer for execution was 
granted "the movants did not yet have the legal personality as parties of the 
case to obtain said execution" (petition, par. VII), and that at the time the 
prayer for execution was granted said respondents "did not as yet have legal 
personality to obtain said relief because they have just presented on said 
moment the motion for substitution" (petition, par. VIII).</p>
<p>The Court deems the order of Judge Sanchez as perfectly legal and proper. He 
had to decide the motion in view of the existing state of things at the time it 
was filed, and finding that at that time said respondents had already acquired 
<i>pendente lite</i> the rights and obligations of the former substitute 
plaintiff who had derived title from the original plaintiff in the same case, 
which fact gave said respondents not only the right to be substituted but also 
the right to have execution on the judgment, His Honor could not have correctly 
decided the motion otherwise. For all practical purposes, there would be no 
substantial difference between a motion such as that filed by said respondents 
and two separate motions, one for substitution and another for execution of 
judgment, which they could certainly have rightfully filed on the same date, the 
second attached to the first. Moreover, the principle of liberality in the 
interest of just, speedy and inexpensive determination of judicial controversies 
and administration of substantial and practical justice permeates the present 
Rules of Court, if indeed it did not already permeate the former Code of Civil 
Procedure (Rule 1, section 2).</p>
<p>Another ground alleged for the petition for certiorari is that petitioner had 
filed a <i>supersedeas</i> bond, and it is alleged that said bond was sufficient 
to stay execution without need of satisfying the rentals, particularly the 
current ones. Apart from the circumstance that said bond did not specify any 
amount (although it may be stated that it did stipulate the obligation of the 
principal and the surety to "pay all rents, damages: and costs which may be 
awarded" against the appellant on appeal or on the dismissal thereof), it is not 
correct to say that payment or deposit at the times marked by Rule 72, section 
8, of the current rents during the pendency of the appeal might be dispensed 
with. The <i>supersedeas</i> bond does not relieve from the obligation to make 
such timely payment or deposit (Zamora <i>vs</i>. Dinglasan and Hilario, 77 
Phil., 46).</p>
<p>Wherefore, finding the instant petition devoid of merit, the Court hereby 
denies the same, with costs. So ordered.</p><i>Paras, Perfecto, Briones,</i> and 
<i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
