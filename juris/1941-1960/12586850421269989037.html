				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Both  parties,  plaintiffs and  defendant,  are  appealing from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, dismissing the complaint of plaintiffs and the  counterclaim of defendant. <br><br>On February  16, 1954, plaintiffs commenced the present action  in the  Leyte  court,  alleging that they were co-owners of Lot No. 676 of the Tacloban cadastre, covered by Original Certificate  of Title  No. 10552;  that in  May, 1945,  up to  June, 1950,  inclusive,  due to their absence from  Tacloban,  Leyte,  they had neglected or abandoned the  said  lot and  that  defendant Ciriaco Enriquez, without their knowledge  and consent, voluntarily administered the said lot by leasing the  same to several tenants and collecting during the aforesaid period,  rentals thereon  amounting to P2,552,  thereby  unjustly enriching himself  in the  said sum; that they, plaintiffs, have  made  repeated  demands on Enriquez for reimbursement of the said amount, but that he had refused to comply with their demand, and so they asked  the court for judgment  on the said amount, plus P200 as damages. <br><br>Defendant Enriquez answering the  complaint, alleged that the lot in question had been abandoned by the plaintiffs not since May, 1945, but since the year 1932, and  that when he (Enriquez) bought lot No. 2059 of the Tacloban cadastre,  contiguous and adjacent to said  Lot No.  676, he thought  that the latter was included in  the parcel he had  bought, and  so in good faith, he  had occupied and rented it to tenants together with his parcel, but that the rentals received by him  did not reach the sum of P2,552 claimed by  the plaintiffs; that furthermore, during the said period, he had been paying  the  real estate taxes on the said lot in question; and that under the provisions of Articles  526, 527, 528, and 544 of  the New  Civil  Code, he should be considered  as a possessor in good faith and entitled to the fruits received by him.   By way of counter-claim, he alleged  that  in connection with the  demand of plaintiffs  for reimbursement, which he had refused,  they had  filed fabricated charges of estafa against him in the Municipal Court of the City of Tacloban on  September 16, 1953, and that on October 30 of the same year,  the Municipal  Court dismissed the  charges on the ground that  there was no crime of  estafa  committed, and that the case involved was  more of a civil nature; that as a result of the filing of the false  charges, he suffered humiliation, embarrassment and  mental anguish, thereby  causing  him damages in the amount of P5,000, and  compelling him to employ the services of counsel in the amount of P500; and finally,  he  asked the court  to render judgment on the pleadings. <br><br>The plaintiffs answering the counterclaim, admit having filed the criminal  charges against the defendant and the dismissal  of the same, but  that  they disagreed with the order of the Municipal  Court and intended to revive the same criminal case in the Court of First Instance of Leyte; and that as regards defendant's petition for judgment on the pleadings, they had no objections, provided the defendant in his prayer for judgment "is  understood to admit all the material and relevant allegations of the plaintiffs' complaint",  including the allegations that  the defendant had unjustly enriched himself in the amount of  P2,552; and that because of his refusal to pay said amount  they were  compelled to  bring the present action,  incurring damages in the amount of P200 as attorney's fees. <br><br>Acting  upon the  motion for judgment of the pleadings, the trial court rendered judgment, and applying the articles of the Civil  Code aforementioned,  it dismissed the  complaint  as well as  the  counterclaim.  Plaintiffs  in  their notice  of appeal stated that they were appealing the judgment to the "Supreme Court on pure question  of law". The appeal,  however, was  first taken to  the Court of Appeals, which tribunal  later  certified the appeal to us on the ground that  it involved  only question of  law. <br><br>Plaintiffs in their appeal brief,  claim  that the  trial court erred in rendering judgment on the pleadings.  However, as already stated, they informed the court that they had no objection to the petition  of the  defendant for judgment on  the pleadings, although  they imposed the condition  that  defendant  admit that he had  received the amount of their demand from the rentals on the property m question, and that he refused to pay the same to them. <br><br>We  believe that  the  trial court was fully justified in dismissing the complaint.  Under the law (the Old as well as the New Civil Code), a person occupying the property of another is deemed to be  a possessor in good faith, and that he who alleges bad faith on the part of the possessor has the burden of proof.  In the present case, the defendant claimed good faith, alleging that the lot in question was adjacent to his, and that he believed in good faith that it formed part of it.  This claim was not  disproved by the plaintiffs, neither did they submit evidence to show bad faith on the  part of the defendant.   As a  possessor  in good faith, the defendant was entitled to the fruits received by him  until June,  1950, when  he  was advised by the plaintiff that the lot  belonged to them. <br><br>As regards the dismissal  of the counterclaim,  the defendant  equally failed to  prove that the plaintiffs  acted in bad faith and with ulterior motives in filing the criminal charges against him.  It may be presumed  that  they believed  in good  faith that his  refusal  to  reimburse the rentals received by  him constituted  estafa, until they were  disabused in  said belief  by the  Municipal Court holding  that  the  responsibility  of  defendant was civil rather than  criminal.  Moreover, the  defendant  had received rentals from the lot of the plaintiffs for so many years,  which on the  claim of good faith, as  a possessor he  does  not  have to reimburse  to them, and so  it is  a matter of justice and equity that he forego his claim for alleged damages contained in his counterclaim. <br><br>In view of the  foregoing, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.  No  costs. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon,  Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.  B. L., Endencia,</span> and  <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix,  JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J.,</span> concurs  in the result. <br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br>PADILLA, J., dissenting: <br><br>It appears that the parcel  of land acquired by purchase by the defendant and the  one adjoining it owned by the plaintiffs are registered  under the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496).   The fact that  the defendant  found  it unoccupied or abandoned and that he was made to believe that the parcel of land  he had acquired by purchase included the adjoining parcel of land owned by and registered in the name of the plaintiffs,  does not render him a possessor in  good faith.  Were this a matter  of a  few square meters  and  with  a standing  wall  pointing  out  the boundary of the parcel of  land acquired by the party who claims to be  a  possessor in good faith  of a small adjacent strip of land within the area of  an adjoining registered parcel of land belonging to another, good faith of the former might be  accepted and believed, as  held in Co  Tao <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Chan  Chico, 46 Off, Gaz. 5514.  But  one who purchases a parcel of land registered under the  Torrens system must be presumed  to  know  the area  and boundaries of the acquired parcel of land.  Assuming that he was told  that the adjoining parcel of  land owned by another,  also  registered under the same  system, was included in the parcel of land he had acquired by purchase, that does not make him a possessor in good faith  of the parcel  of land belonging to the other.   He should have first inquired and verified the information given him,  and should not have relied upon it and  proceeded  to lease it to other parties.  Law, equity  and justice  demand  that he turn over the rentals he had collected from the parcel of land which he does not own to the rightful owners, as no  one  is allowed to  unjustly enrich  himself  at  the expense of another.  The case  should  be remanded to the trial court for determination of the amount the defendant had collected and the  amount of taxes which he claims he had paid for the parcel of land owned by the plaintiffs,  and after determination thereof and offsetting one  against the other, to order the defendant  to  pay the balance  to  the plaintiffs. Judgment affirmed. <br><br></div>
