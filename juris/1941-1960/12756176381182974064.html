				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. IGNACIO CALINAWAN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the People's Court finding 
the defendant, Ignacio Calinawan, guilty of the complex crime of treason with 
murder, and sentencing him to the death penalty, to pay a line of P20,000 and an 
indemnity to the heirs of Romualdo Nacario in the sum of P2,000 plus the costs. 

<p align="justify">The information charges four counts. We are in full agreement 
with the opinion of the Solicitor General that, under the evidence on record, 
the lower court erred in convicting the appellant of treason. The only point 
that consequently arises is whether, as contended by the Solicitor General, said 
appellant may be convicted of murder. This view is predicated on the facts, duly 
borne out by the evidence, that in the morning of September 26, 1944, the 
appellant and an unknown companion, both armed with rifles, were riding on their 
respective bicycles in barrio Pakigne, municipality of Minglanilla, Province of 
Cebu. Upon seeing the appellant on said occasion, Romualdo Nacario started to 
run, whereupon the appellant whistled at him. As Romualdo Nacario ignored the 
call and continued to run, the appellant got off from his bicycle and, from a 
distance of some fifty meters, fired a shot at Romualdo who was fatally hit.</p>
<p align="justify">In classifying the offense as murder, the Solicitor General 
argues that the attack was sudden and unexpected, and made while the deceased, 
Romualdo Nacario, was running away with his back towards the appellant, and that 
Romualdo did not have any opportunity of defending himself or of avoiding the 
attack, which was perpetrated without any risk to the appellant arising from any 
defense which the deceased might have offered. </p>
<p align="justify">We believe that the appellant must be held liable for the 
killing of Romualdo Nacario, but that the offense should be classified only as 
homicide. There is absolutely no indication in the record that the appellant was 
purposely in search for Romualdo, and the bare facts proven at the trial are not 
inconsistent with the inference that the meeting was casual. Much less can the 
proof warrant the theory that the appellant had a previous determination to kill 
Romualdo, and the bare facts proven at the trial are likewise not inconsistent 
with the conclusion that the appellant fired at his victim impulsively. And 
considering in this connection, that the shot was fired at a distance of fifty 
meters and while Romualdo was running, appellant's situation may fairly come 
under the doctrine mentioned in People vs. Canete, 44 Phil., 478, 481, that the 
method of assault adopted by the aggressor was not "deliberately chosen with a 
special view to the accomplishment of the act without risk to the assailant from 
any defense that the party assailed may make," said case making special 
reference to an instance "where the slayer acted instantaneously upon the 
advantage which resulted from the accidental fall of the person slain."</p>
<p align="justify">From the scanty facts revealed in the record, we cannot suppose 
that appellant knew beforehand that Romualdo was unarmed or that the latter 
"would not stop, face and attack the appellant, so as to be able to hold that 
the appellant perpetrated the fatal act without risk to himself, especially if 
we bear in mind that Romualdo must have known that his attempt to flee would 
naturally provoke the appellant. Upon the whole, we are not prepared to rule 
that the qualifying circumstance of treachery was present. </p>
<p align="justify">There is another reason why we are averse to the theory that 
treachery may be taken into account. It is note-worthy that count No. 2 of the 
information alleges that the appellant "wilfully, unlawfully and treasonably 
while on patrol with another undercover, against guerrillas, shot to death one Romualdo Nacario a guerrilla suspect." A qualifying circumstance must be pleaded 
(U. S. vs. Campo, 23 Phil., 368) ; and it is plain that there is nothing in the 
allegations in count No. 2 suggestive of the presence of treachery. The word 
"treasonably," without more, may of course be loosely synonymous with 
"treacherously." The information, however, in its entirety charges the appellant 
with treason, from which it becomes clear that "treasonably" was used to denote 
the commission of an act in a manner penalized by article 114 of the "Revised 
Penal Code, and not merely of an act penalized as murder, specially when 
reference is made to count No. 1 in which the word "treasonably" was also used 
in accusing the appellant of having joined and served the enemy as guide, 
informer and spy and of having accompanied the enemy in his retreat upon the 
invasion of the Americans. That such was the sense intended by the prosecutor is 
further made manifest by the fact that he used the specific term 'treachery," as 
a concurring circumstance, in the last paragraph of the information, thereby 
indicating his desire to differentiate "treasonably" from "treacherously." This 
allegation of treachery, made under count No. 4, cannot refer to the distinct 
count No. 2.</p>
<p align="justify">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the appellant can and 
must be found guilty only of homicide without any attending circumstances, for 
which he is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from 8 years and 1 
day <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>, to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day, <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span>, and to 
indemnify the heirs of Romualdo Nacario in the sum of P2,000, plus the costs. So 
ordered. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
