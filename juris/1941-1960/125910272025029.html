				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from  an order,  dated  October 27, 1958, of the Court of First  Instance of  Manila,  dismissing its Civil Case No. 34626  for lack  of  jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Plaintiff  Antonio Perez, in his own representation and as guardian <em>ad litem</em> of his adoptive son, Benigno Perez y Tuason,  initiated  this civil case against  Angela  Tuason de  Perez,  the  plaintiff's wife  and  Benigno's mother. The  complaint  states  three  causes  of action.</p>
<p>Under the first cause of action, it  is averred that the defendant  is squandering all of her  estate on a  young man by the name of Jose  Antonio Campos Boloix, because of  which Benigno Perez  y  Tuason,  acting through  his guardian <em>ad  litem,</em> the  plaintiff, prays  that his mother, the defendant,  be declared a prodigal and placed under guardianship;  that a  suitable  person  or  institution be appointed  to administer  her  properties; and that  during the pendency of this suit, a  writ of injunction be issued to  prevent the continued  waste and dissipation  of her properties.</p>
<p>In  his  second cause  of action,  the  husband  Antonio Perez, for and in his own behalf, asserts that by virtue of the said alleged! acts of prodigality committed by the defendant wife, the conjugal partnership of gain  is being dissipated to  the prejudice of  both spouses; wherefore, he prays for  a writ  of injunction  to restrain her from "dissolving  and liquidating the conjugal partnership of gains".</p>
<p>Finally, as a third  cause of action, the plaintiff  husband avers that,  in addition  to the aforementioned acts,  the defendant has repeatedly  advised him,  as well  as other persbns,  that  she intends to  marry Jose  Campos Boloix and to have a child by him not withstanding her present marriage  to the plaintiff, Antonio Perez;  and  that, if she could not have such a child, she was  willing to have one  by any  other person,  just to  put plaintiff in  a ridiculous and embarrassing position.  Plaintiff, therefore, seeks to recover from  her the total sum of P185,000.00 by way of damages and attorney's fees.</p>
<p>On January 2, 1958, after a preliminary hearing, wherein plaintiff was heard <em>ex parte,</em> the Court of First  Instance of  Manila  issued  a preliminary  injunction as  prayed for in the complaint.</p>
<p>On March  19, 1958,  the defendant appeared  through counsel and prayed for  the dismissal  of the case on the ground of <em>res  judicata,</em> and that the preliminary injunction be  dissolved.   Said motion was denied  by  the  court  a quo in its order of April 2,  1958.</p>
<p>On April 16, 1958, the defendant filed a second motion to dismiss the  case, this time  on  the ground  that  the Court of First Instance of  Manila had  no jurisdiction over  the  present proceedings,  which, according to  her, is vested under Republic Act No. 1401 with the  Juvenile and  Domestic Relations  Court.  While this last motion was being considered by the  Court, a compromise agreement was  arrived  at and submitted for approval of the court  on  May 2,  1958.   On May  31,  1958, before  the Court  could  act,  defendant filed  an  opposition  to  the approval of  the  compromise  agreement, on the  ground that  (a)  the same  is  contrary  to law  and (6)  it was not  freely  or validly entered  into  by  her representative. Without resolving this particular question, the lower court asked the  parties to submit further memoranda  on  the sole issue of jurisdiction.   After this was done, the trial court, by  order of  September 30,  1958,  ordered the dismissal of the case on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction over  the subject matter.   Hence, plaintiffs  Perez  (father and  son) appealed.</p>
<p>Appellants  assign three  alleged errors  in  the  order appealed from, as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The trial court erred in  holding that the Court of First Instance of Manila has  no jurisdiction over  the causes of  action alleged by Antonio  Perez in the complaint.</p>
  <p>"The trial court erred in holding that the Court of First Instance of Manila has no jurisdiction  over the causes of action alleged by Benigno Perez y Tuason in the complaint.</p>
  <p>The trial  court erred in holding  that the Doctrine  of  Estoppel of Jurisdiction is not applicable in this  country and erred further in failing to apply said doctrine to the present proceedings." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find the appeal to be untenable.</p>
<p>Republic  Act  No.  1401,  creating  the  Juvenile and Domestic, Relations  Court  of  the City  of  Manila and defining  its jurisdiction,  provides, among  other  things, that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  38-A—Provisions  of  the Judiciary  Act to the  contrary notwithstanding, the court  shall have <em>exclusive  original jurisdiction</em> to hear  and  decide the  following cases after the effectivity of  this Act:</p>
  <p>(b) —Cases involving custody, <em>guardianship</em>, adoption, paternity. and acknowledgment;</p>
  <p align="center"> *       *        *        *        *       *       *</p>
  <p>(d) —Proceedings  brought  under  the provisions  of  Articles <em>one hundred sixteen,</em> two  hundred twenty-five, two  hundred fifty, two  and three  hundred thirty-one of  the  Civil  Code."   (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While  Article  116 of  the  Civil Code  (referred  to in subsection  [d]  above)  states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When one of the  spouses neglects his or her duties to the conjugal union or brings danger, d<em>ishonor or material injury</em> upon the other, the injured party may apply to the court for relief. </p>
  <p>The  court may counsel the offended party to comply with his or her duties, and take such measures as may be proper/'  (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to see that the first cause of action  set forth in  the complaint, wherein the minor  Benigno  Perez  y Tuason, through  his representative, asks that his mother be placed  under guardianship  because  of her alleged prodigality, and prays that a suitable person or institution be appointed to administer her properties,  is  exclusively cognizable  by the Domestic Relations Court.  The action falls  squarely  under the provisions of  subsection  (6), Section 38-A, R.  A. 1401, above-quoted, as a "case involving . . .  guardianship."   No  error  was,  therefore, committed in the appealed order  in holding that this  cause of  action lay  outside the  jurisdiction of the Court of First  Instance.</p>
<p>The  same thing can be  said  of the  third  cause of action wherein Antonio Perez seeks to  recover  damages and attorney's fees because his wife's act (avowing openly her intention to marry  and  have  a child by Campos Boloix  or  if not, by  anyone  else)  placed the  plaintiff "in  an  embarrassing  and  contemptible  position"  (sic) and causing him "grave anxiety, wounded feelings, extreme humiliation."  The  case involves  acts of a spouse  that "brings.....<em>dishonor</em>..... upon the other (spouse)" under Article 116 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, and also lies within the jurisdiction  of the  Domestic Relations Court.  The law (subsection  (d), Sec. 38-A) expressly gives that court  <em>exclusive original  jurisdiction</em> over  proceedings  under the  provisions of Article 116 of the Civil Code.                   ,</p>
<p>More controversial  is  the  issue involved in the second cause of  action of the complaint,  wherein Antonio Perez alleges that the prodigal acts of his wife  result in the conjugal  partnership of gains being dissipated  to the prejudice of both spouses, and prays for a writ of injunction to restrain  her from "dissolving and liquidating the conjugal partnership of  gains."  The Court of  First Instance  held  that  this cause of  action is  also  one of those  provided by Article 116 of4 the  Civil Code,  as  a case where one spouse  "brings danger  * * * or <em>material injury"</em> upon the other, and, therefore, relief should be sought in the Court  of Domestic Relations.</p>
<p>We  are  inclined   to  think that "material  injury"  as used in Article  116  does not refer to  patrimonial  (economic) injury or damage,  but to  personal  (i. e. physical or  morai)  injury  to one  of the  spouses,  since  Article 116  lies  in the  chapter'  concerning <em>personal  relations </em>between husband and wife.  Nevertheless, the court below was correct in viewing this  cause  of  action as primarily predicated on  the  grant of  guardianship due to  alleged prodigality  of  the wife, since the  allegation thereof is therein reiterated, and  the remedy of injunction  sought against  further  (i.e.  future)  acts of disposition  (no annulment  of  her  past transactions is  demanded)  must be  necessarily  based  on  the  wife's  being  subject  to guardianship.</p>
<p>If the  wife were  not in  any  way incapacitated, the mere fact that the  alienation of her  paraphernal would deprive  the conjugal partnership of  the  future  fruits thereof would not give rise to a cause of  action for injunction, since the  conjugal partnership is only entitled to the <em>net</em> fruits of such  property,  after  deducting administration expenses   (People's  Bank   <em>vs</em>.   Register  of Deeds, 60 Phil., 167), and  it is nowhere alleged that any such net  fruits exist.  More  fundamental still, the wife's statutory power to alienate her parapherna  (Phil.  Civil Code,  Article 140) necessarily implies power  to alienate its  future fruits, since  the latter are mere accessory to the property itself.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the second  cause of action is inextricably woven into and cannot stand independently of the demand for <em>guardianship</em> of the wife, the injunction  being a mere incident thereof;  so that like  the first cause  of action, the second also lay within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Domestic  Relations.</p>
<p>The  third alleged error  charged  against   the  Court below,  that  it  should have  held  that defendant  was in estoppel to question the  jurisdiction  of the trial court, is,  on  its face,  without  merit.  Assuming  for the sake of argument that defendant appellee  was placed in such estoppel by  merely  executing  the compromise and submitting it to  the Court's approval, such estoppel  could not operate against the Court.   Regardless of the parties, the Court, at  any time, could <em>motu proprio</em> inquire and determine whether it had  jurisdiction over the  subject matter of the action,  and  could dismiss  the case  (as it did)  if it  found that it had no power to  act therein.</p>
<p>The  order appealed  from is hereby  affirmed.   Costs against appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.  J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Gutierrez  David, Paredes,</em> and  <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
