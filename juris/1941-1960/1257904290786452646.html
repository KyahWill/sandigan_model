				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On April 6, 1953, the spouses Epifanio J. Alano and Cecilia Pading de Alano 
executed a promissory note in! consideration of a loan of P65,000.00 they 
obtained from Claro Cortes. As security for said loan, they mortgaged several 
parcels of land owned by them situated in Bulacan empowering the mortgagee to 
extra judicially foreclosed the mortgage. On January 29, 1954, Cortes foreclosed 
the mortgage and the properties were sold to him at an auction, sale for the sum 
of P15,000.00. Subsequently, Cortes filed ' a complaint in the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal for the collection of the balance.
<p>To avoid embarrassment caused by the filing of the complaint, the Alanos 
requested Cortes to withdraw the same and increase the loan to P74,000.00. The 
latter having acceded to said request, the former drew a new promissory note 
wherein they promised to pay the above amount plus 12% interest on or before 
July 21, 1954, and executed att the same time a deed of mortgage over the same 
properties to secure payment of their indebtedness.</p>
<p>On January 5, 1955, Cortes obtained from the Provincial Sheriff of Bulacan a 
deed of sale of the lands mortgaged to him after consolidating his ownership 
over the same, and registered the document with the register of deeds causing 
the latter to issue new certificates of title in his name. This act prompted the 
Alanos to institute a complaint on February 4, 1958 before the Court of First 
Instance of Bulacan (Case No. 1652) praying, among others, for the cancellation 
of the certificates of title issued to Cortes and the issuance of another in 
their names. Before trial, however, the parties filed with the court a motion 
for amicable settlement, the pertinent portions of which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The parties, assisted by their respective counsel, most respectfully 
manifest that they agree to an amicable settlement of this case, subject to 
approval by this Hon. Court, in accordance with the stipulations agreed upon at 
the resumption of pretrial this morning, as follows:</p>
<p>"1. That plaintiffs shall pay unto defendant the total sum of One Hundred 
Thirty One Thousand (P131,000.00) Pesos, Philippine Currency, in full settlement 
of any and all claims which defendant has or may have against plaintiffs under 
the mortgages dated April 6, 1953 and March 22, 1954, mentioned in the 
complaint;</p>
<p>"2. That for and in consideration of such settlement, defendant shall 
reconvey unto plaintiffs the properties subject of the complaint, covered by 
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-14492, T-14493, T-14494, T-14495, and 
T-14496 (formerly Nos. T-8666, T-9763, T-8807, T-9610, and T-9637, respectively) 
of the land records of Bulacan, free from any and all liens and encumbrances of 
whatsoever kind and nature, and with warranty against adverse claims of third 
parties howsoever arising;</p>
<p>"3.That the amount of P131,000.00 to be paid by plaintiffs as hereinabove 
mentioned is understood to absorb and include payment of attorney's fees for 
defendant's counsel, Atty. Jose C. Colayco, as well as payment of a claim of 
Lina S. Cortes against plaintiffs for the sum of P4,500.00, representing value 
of jewelries, so that defendant shall assume payment of these two minor items 
for his own account;</p>
<p>Wherefore, it is most respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered in 
accordance with the foregoing stipulations, without pronouncement as to 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>In conformity with the above amicable settlement, the trial court on July 29, 
1958 rendered decision ordering "the parties to comply with the terms and 
conditions therein set forth, without costs." Plaintiffs having failed to pay 
the above amount on September 2, 1958, defendant filed a motion asking the court 
to fix a date on which they shall settle the same oh condition that upon their 
failure to do so the complaint shall be considered dismissed with prejudice. 
Plaintiffs filed their opposition and the court, treating defendant's motion as, 
a motion for execution, issued a writ of execution on September 13, 1958. But 
before receipt by plaintiffs of a copy of said order, defendant on September 15, 
1958, filed a motion praying that an order be issued directing the sale at 
public auction of the right of plaintiffs to pay the sum of P131,000.00 awarded 
to him, but the court deferred consideration of said motion in order to give the 
parties an opportunity to settle their differences.</p>
<p>On October 7,1958, defendant filed a second motion reiterating the prayer in 
his motion of September 15, 1958. On October 13, 1958, the court issued an order 
directing plaintiffs either to pay defendant or to deposit with the clerk of 
court the amount of P131,000.00 within a period of 30 days from receipt of a 
copy of the order failing in which their right over the properties will be 
deemed forfeited thereby relieving defendant of his obligation to execute the 
deed of reconveyance as ordered in the decision of July 29, 1958. Their motion 
for reconsideration having been denied, plaintiffs appealed to this Court 
contending that (1) the court <em>a quo</em> erred in amending the judgment 
dated July 29, 1958, by fixing a term for the payment of plaintiffs' obligation 
and adding a forfeiture clause in favor of defendant; (2) the court <em>a 
quo</em> erred in not requiring defendant to comply first with the judgment 
before demanding plaintiffs' performance; and (3) the court <em>a quo</em> erred 
in not enforcing the judgment as it is without amendment.</p>
<p>There is no dispute that in the compromise agreement entered into by the 
parties which was submitted to the trial court appellants bound themselves to 
pay appellee the sum of P131,000.00 in full settlement of the dispute existing 
between them and that the latter agreed to reconvey the lands in question.. It 
is also clear that conformably with such agreement the court rendered decision 
enjoining the parties to comply with its terms and conditions but because 
neither the compromise agreement nor the court specified the time within which 
they should make good their commitments, upon motion of appellee the court fixed 
a period of 30 days within which appellants should pay the amount of P131,000.00 
awarded to defendant. This we believe the court has power to do, firstly, 
because the judgment being based on a compromise is immediately executory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the obligations of the parties 
demandable at once, »o that what the court did was merely to implement its 
decision. Secondly, wttile no period was fixed in the amicable settlement it 
does not follow that no period was intended by the parties, for it,is 
preposterous to presume that when they entered into such agreement they intended 
to leave the performance of their undertaking to the whim of either party 
thereby frustrating the very purpose of the agreement. The court, therefore, was 
justified in issuing the order in question, it being- a sjtep necessary to give 
force and effect to¦ its decision (Section 6, Rule 124, Rules of Court; Article 
1197, liew Civil Code; Barretto <em>vs</em>. The City of Manila,. 7 Phil., 416; 
Concepcion <em>vs</em>. People, 74 Phil., 63; Yacapin <em>vs</em>. Neri, 40 
Phil., 61, 67.)</p>
<p>As regards the forfeiture clause, we also believe that the same is justified. 
It should be noted that appellants obliged themselves to pay appellee the sum of 
P131,000.00 as a condition for the latter to reconvey the properties to them, 
This is a reciprocal obligation which can only be enforced if one party is 
willing- to do its share in the undertaking (Article 1169; Civil Code), and in 
order that appellants may be induced to do their share which apparently they are 
reluctant to undertake, the court found it necessary to include the forfeiture 
clause in its decision. This the court can do under our rules (Section 6, Rule 
in view of the supervening circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Obviously a prevailing party in a civil action is entitled to a of execution 
of the final judgment obtained by him within five years from its entry (section 
443 of the Code of Civil Procedure). But it has been repeatedly held, and it is 
now well-settled in this jurisdiction, that when after judgment has been 
rendered and the latter has become final, facts and circumstances transpire 
which render its execution impossible or unjust, <em>the interested party may 
ask the court to modify or alter the judgment to harmonize the same with justice 
and the facts."</em> (De la Costa <em>vs</em>. Cleofas, 67 Phil., 686; Ocampo 
<em>vs</em>. Sanchez, 97 Phil., 472; 51 Off. Gaz., No. 9, 4542, 4548. Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to 
costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em> and 
<em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur, .</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Conception</em> and <em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur in the 
result.</p>
<p><em>Order affirmed. </em></p>
