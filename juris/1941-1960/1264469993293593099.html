				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioner-defendant, a member of the Metropolitan Constabulary of Manila charged with&nbsp; the supervision and control of the production, procurement and distribution of goods and other necessaries as denned in section 1 of Act No. 9 of the National Assembly of the&nbsp; so-called Republic of the Philippines, was prosecuted for&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of robbery as denned and&nbsp; penalized by section 2&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; of Act No. 65 of the same Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he commenced to serve on August 21, 1944, by the&nbsp; Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction,&nbsp; created in&nbsp; section 1 of&nbsp; Ordinance No. 7&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; by the&nbsp; President of the so-called Republic of the Philippines,&nbsp; pursuant to the authority conferred upon&nbsp; him by the Constitution and laws&nbsp; of the said Republic.&nbsp; And the procedure&nbsp; followed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the trial was the summary one established in Chapter II of Executive Order&nbsp; No. 157&nbsp; of the Chairman&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Commission, made applicable to the trial violations of said Act No. 65&nbsp; by section 9 thereof and&nbsp; section&nbsp; 5 of said Ordinance&nbsp; No. 7.</p> <p>The petition for habeas corpus&nbsp; is based on&nbsp; the ground that the Court of Special and Executive Criminal Jurisdiction created by Ordinance No. 7 "was a political instrumentality of the military forces&nbsp; of the Japanese Imperial Army, the aims and purposes of which are repugnant to those aims&nbsp; and political&nbsp; purposes of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as those of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States of America,&nbsp; and therefore,&nbsp; null&nbsp; and void <em>ab initio</em>," that the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Ordinance No. 7 are violative of the fundamental laws of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and&nbsp; "the petitioner has been deprived of his constitutional rights";&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; herein is being punished by a law created to serve the&nbsp; political purpose of the Japanese Imperial Army in the&nbsp; Philippines, and "that the penalties provided for are much (more)&nbsp; severe than the penalties&nbsp; provided for in the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code."</p> <p>The Solicitor General, in&nbsp; his answer in behalf of&nbsp; the respondent, states that, in his own opinion, for the reasons expressed in his brief in the case of People of the Philippines, plaintiff-appellant, <em>vs.</em> Benedicto&nbsp; Jose y Santos,&nbsp; defendant-appellee,&nbsp; G. R. No.&nbsp; L-22&nbsp; (p. 612,<em> post</em>),&nbsp; the acts and proceedings taken and had before the said Court of Special and Exclusive&nbsp; Criminal Jurisdiction which resulted in&nbsp; the conviction and imprisonment of the herein petitioner, should now be denied force and efficacy, and therefore the petition for habeas corpus should be&nbsp; granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasons advanced by the Solicitor General in said&nbsp; brief&nbsp; and in&nbsp; his reply memorandum in&nbsp; support of his contention are, that the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction created,&nbsp; and the summary&nbsp; procedure prescribed therefor, by said Ordinance No,&nbsp; 7 in connection with Executive&nbsp; Order No. 157 of the Chairman of the Executive Commission, are tinged&nbsp; with political complexion; that&nbsp; the procedure prescribed in Ordinance No. 7 does&nbsp; not afford a fair trial, violates&nbsp; the Constitution of&nbsp; the Commonwealth,&nbsp; and&nbsp; impairs&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitutional rights of accused persons under their legitimate Constitution.&nbsp; And&nbsp; he cites, in support of this last proposition, the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United&nbsp; States in the cases of Texas <em>vs.</em> White&nbsp; (7 Wall., 700, 743);&nbsp; Horn <em>vs.</em> Lockhart (17 Wall., 570, 581) ; United States <em>vs.</em> Home Insurance Co.&nbsp; (22 Wall., 99, 104) ; Sprott<em> vs.</em> United States&nbsp; (20 Wall., 459).</p> <p>The City Fiscal of Manila appeared before this Court as <em>amicus&nbsp; curiæ</em>.&nbsp; In his memorandum he submits that the petition for&nbsp; habeas corpus&nbsp; be denied&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; following grounds: That the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction&nbsp; and the Acts, Ordinances&nbsp; and&nbsp; Executive Orders, creating&nbsp; it are not of a political complexion, for said Court was created, and the crimes and&nbsp; offenses placed under its&nbsp; jurisdiction were penalized heavily, in response to an urgent necessity, according to the preamble of Ordinance No. 7; that the right to appeal in a criminal case is not a constitutional right; and that the summary procedure established in said Ordinance No. 7 is not violative of the provision of Article III, section 1 (18) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, to the effect that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself, nor of the provision of&nbsp; section 1&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; of the same Article that no&nbsp; person&nbsp; shall be deprived of&nbsp; life, liberty, or property without due process of law.</p> <p>The features of the summary procedure adopted by Ordinance No. 7,&nbsp; assailed&nbsp; by the petitioner and the Solicitor General as impairing the constitutional rights of an accused are; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; court may&nbsp; interrogate the accused and witnesses before trial in order to clarify the points in dispute; that the refusal&nbsp; of the accused to answer the questions may&nbsp; be considered unfavorable to him;&nbsp; that if from&nbsp; the facts admitted at the preliminary interrogatory it appears&nbsp; that the defendant is&nbsp; guilty,&nbsp; he&nbsp; may be immediately&nbsp; convicted; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; sentence of the court is not appealable, except in case&nbsp; of&nbsp; death&nbsp; penalty which cannot be executed unless and until reviewed and affirmed by&nbsp; a&nbsp; special&nbsp; division of the Supreme Court composed of three&nbsp; Justices.</p> <p>Before proceeding further, and in&nbsp; order to determine the law applicable to the questions involved in the present case, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; necessary to bear in mind the nature&nbsp; and status of the government&nbsp; established in these Islands by the Japanese forces of&nbsp; occupation&nbsp; under the designation of Republic of the Philippines.</p> <p>In the case of Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (G. R. No. L-5, pp. 113, 127, <em>ante</em>), recently decided, this&nbsp; Court, speaking through the Justice who pens&nbsp; this decision, held:</p> <blockquote> <p>"In view of the foregoing, it&nbsp; is evident that the Philippine Executive Commission, which was organized by Order No. 1, issued on January 23, 1942, by the Commander of the Japanese&nbsp; forces, was&nbsp; a civil government established by the military forces&nbsp; of occupation and therefore a <em>de facto</em> government of the second kind.&nbsp; It was not different from the government established by the British in Castine, Maine, or&nbsp; by&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States in Tampico, Mexico.&nbsp; As Halleck says, 'the government established over an enemy's territory during the military occupation may exercise all the powers given by the laws of war to the conqueror over the conquered, and is&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to all&nbsp; restrictions&nbsp; which that code&nbsp; imposes.&nbsp; It is of little consequence&nbsp; whether vsuch government be called a military or civil government. Its character is the same and the source of its authority the same.&nbsp; In either case it is&nbsp; a&nbsp; government imposed by the laws of war and so far as it concerns the inhabitants of such&nbsp; territory or the&nbsp; rest&nbsp; of the&nbsp; world&nbsp; those laws alone determine&nbsp; the legality&nbsp; or illegality&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; acts.' (Vol. 2 p.&nbsp; 466.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the&nbsp; Philippine Executive Commission was a civil&nbsp; and not a military government and was&nbsp; run by Filipinos and not by Japanese nationals is of no consequence."</p> </blockquote> <p>And speaking of the so-called Republic of the Philippines in the same decision, this&nbsp; Court said:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The&nbsp; so-called Republic of the Philippines, apparently established and organized as a sovereign state independent from any&nbsp; other government by the Filipino people, was, in truth and reality,&nbsp; a&nbsp; government established by the belligerent occupant or the Japanese&nbsp; forces of occupation. It was of the same character as the Philippine Executive Commission,&nbsp; and the ultimate source of its authority was the same—the Japanese&nbsp; military authority and government.&nbsp; As General MacArthur stated&nbsp; in his proclamation of October 23, 1944, a portion of which has been already quoted, 'under enemy duress, a so-called government styled as the "Republic&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines"&nbsp; was&nbsp; established&nbsp; on October 14, 1943, based upon neither&nbsp; the free expression of the peoples' will nor the sanction of the Government of the United States.'&nbsp; Japan&nbsp; had&nbsp; no&nbsp; legal power to grant independence to the Philippines or transfer the sovereignty of the United States to, or recognize the latent sovereignty of, the Filipino people, before its military occupation&nbsp; and possession of the Islands had matured into an absolute and permanent dominion or sovereignty by&nbsp; a treaty of peace or other means recognized in the law&nbsp; of nations."</p> </blockquote> <p>As the so-called Republic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines was a <em>de facto </em>government of the second kind (of paramount force), as the government established in Castine,&nbsp; Maine, during its occupation&nbsp; by the British forces and as that of Tampico, Mexico, occupied during the war with that country by the United&nbsp; States Army,&nbsp; the&nbsp; questions&nbsp; involved in the present case cannot be decided&nbsp; in the&nbsp; light of the Constitution&nbsp; of the Commonwealth&nbsp; Government; because the belligerent occupant <em>was totally independent of the constitution</em> of the occupied territory in carrying&nbsp; out the administration&nbsp; over said territory; and the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in the cases involving the validity of judicial&nbsp; and legislative acts of the Confederate States, considered as <em>de facto</em> governments of the third kind, does not apply to the acts&nbsp; of the so-called Republic of the Philippines which is a <em>de facto</em> government of&nbsp; paramount force.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Constitution of the so-called Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines&nbsp; can neither be&nbsp; applied, since the validity of an act&nbsp; of&nbsp; a belligerent occupant cannot be tested in&nbsp; the light of&nbsp; another act of the&nbsp; same occupant, whose criminal jurisdiction is drawn&nbsp; entirely from the law martial as defined in the&nbsp; usages of&nbsp; nations.</p> <p>In the case of United States <em>vs.</em> Rice (4 Wheaton, 246), the Supreme Court of the United States&nbsp; held that, by the military occupation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Castine,&nbsp; Maine, the&nbsp; sovereignty of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States in the&nbsp; territory was,&nbsp; of course, suspended, and the laws&nbsp; of&nbsp; the United States could no longer be rightfully enforced there or be obligatory upon the inhabitants who remained and submitted to the belligerent occupant.&nbsp; By the surrender the inhabitants&nbsp; passed under a temporary allegiance to the British government, and were bound&nbsp; by such laws, and such only, as it chose to recognize and&nbsp; impose.&nbsp; And Oppenheim,&nbsp; in his Treatise on International&nbsp; Law, says that, in&nbsp; carrying out the administration&nbsp; over the occupied territory and&nbsp; its inhabitants,&nbsp; "<em>the (belligerent)&nbsp; occupant is totally independent of the&nbsp; constitution and the&nbsp; laws of the territory</em>, since occupation is an aim of warfare, and the maintenance and safety of his forces, and the purpose of war, stand in the foreground of&nbsp; his interest and must be promoted under all circumstances or&nbsp; conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Vol. II,&nbsp; Sixth Edition, Revised, 1944,&nbsp; p. 342.)</p> <p>The doctrine laid down in the decisions of the&nbsp; Supreme Court of the United States (in the cases of Texas <em>vs.</em> White, 7&nbsp; Wall., 700;&nbsp; Horn vs. Lockhart,&nbsp; 17&nbsp; Wall.,&nbsp; 570;&nbsp; Williams<em> vs. </em>Bruffy,&nbsp; 96&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S., 176;&nbsp; United&nbsp; States <em>vs.</em> Home Insurance Co.,&nbsp; 20 Wall.,&nbsp; 249; Sprott&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> United States, 20 Wall, 459, and others) that the judicial and legislative acts of the&nbsp; Confederate&nbsp; States which impaired the rights of the citizens under the Constitution&nbsp; of the United States or of the States,&nbsp; or&nbsp; were in conflict with&nbsp; those&nbsp; constitutions, were null and&nbsp; void, is not applicable to the present case.&nbsp; Because that doctrine rests on the propositions that "the concession (of belligerency)&nbsp; made to the Confederate Government&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; sanctioned no hostile&nbsp; legislation *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; and it&nbsp; impaired in no respect the rights of loyal citizens as they had existed at the commencement of tilities" (Williams vs. Bruffy,&nbsp; supra) ; that the Union&nbsp; is perpetual&nbsp; and indissoluble, and the obligation of allegiance to the state and obedience to her laws and state constitution, subject to the Constitution of the United States, remained unimpaired during the War of Secession (Texas <em>vs.</em> White, <em>supra</em>)&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Confederate States "in most, if not in all&nbsp; instances, merely&nbsp; transferred the existing state or ganizations to the support of a new and different national head.&nbsp; The same constitutions, the same laws for the protection of property and personal rights remained and were administered by&nbsp; the&nbsp; same officers."&nbsp; (Sprott <em>vs.</em> United States, <em>supra</em>).&nbsp; In fine, because in the case of the Confederate States, the constitution&nbsp; of each state&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; of the United States or the Union continued in force in those states&nbsp; during the War of Secession; while the Constitution of the Commonwealth Government was suspended during the occupation of the Philippines&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Japanese forces or the belligerent occupant at regular war with the United States.</p> <p>The questions which we have&nbsp; to resolve&nbsp; in the present case in the light of the law of nations are, first, the validity of&nbsp; the creation&nbsp; of the Court of Special&nbsp; and&nbsp; Exclusive Criminal&nbsp; Jurisdiction, and&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; summary&nbsp;&nbsp; procedure adopted for that court; secondly, the&nbsp; validity of the sentence which imposes upon the petitioner the penalty of life imprisonment during the Japanese military occupation; and thirdly, if they&nbsp; were then&nbsp; valid, the&nbsp; effect on said punitive sentence of the reoccupation of the Philippines and the restoration therein of&nbsp; the Commonwealth Government.</p> <p>(1)&nbsp; As&nbsp; to the validity of the creation of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction by Ordinance No. 7, the only factor to be considered is the authority&nbsp; of the legislative power which promulgated said law or ordinance.&nbsp; It is well&nbsp; established in&nbsp; International&nbsp; Law that "The criminal jurisdiction established by the invader in the occupied territory finds its source neither in the laws of the conquering or conquered state,—it is drawn entirely from the law martial as denned in the usages of nations.&nbsp; The authority thus derived can be asserted either through special tribunals, whose authority and procedure is defined in the military code of the conquering state,&nbsp; or through the ordinary&nbsp; courts&nbsp; and&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; of the occupied district." (Taylor, International Public Law, p. 598.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The so-called Republic of the Philippines, being a governmental instrumentality of the&nbsp; belligerent occupant, had therefore the power or was competent to create the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; No question may arise as to whether or not a court is of a political complexion, for it is mere governmental agency charged&nbsp; with the duty of applying the law&nbsp; to cases&nbsp; falling within its jurisdiction. Its judgments and&nbsp; sentences may be&nbsp; of&nbsp; a political&nbsp; complexion or not depending upon&nbsp; the nature or character of the law so applied.&nbsp; There is no room for doubt, therefore, as to the validity&nbsp; of the creation&nbsp; of the court in question.</p> <p>With respect to the summary procedure adopted by Ordinance No. 7, and followed in&nbsp; the trial of the case which resulted in&nbsp; the conviction of the herein petitioner, there is also no question as to the power&nbsp; or competence of the belligerent occupant to promulgate the law providing for such procedure.&nbsp; For "the invader deals freely with the relations of&nbsp; the inhabitants&nbsp; of the occupied territory towards himself&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; for his&nbsp; security also, he declares certain acts, not&nbsp; forbidden by the ordinary laws of the country, to be punishable; <em>and he so far suspends the laws which guard personal liberty as&nbsp; is required&nbsp; for the&nbsp; summary punishment</em> of any one&nbsp; doing such acts."&nbsp; (Halls International Law,&nbsp; seventh&nbsp; ed.,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 500).&nbsp; A belligerent "occupant&nbsp; may where necessary, set&nbsp; up&nbsp; military courts instead of the ordinary courts; and in case, and in so far as, he admits the administration of justice by the ordinary courts, he may nevertheless, so&nbsp; far as&nbsp; is necessary for military purposes, or for the maintenance of public order and safety, <em>temporarily alter the laws, especially the Criminal&nbsp; Law</em>, on the basis of which justice is administered <em>as well as the laws regarding procedure</em>."&nbsp; (Oppenheim'si International Law, Vol. II, sixth edition, 1944, p. 349.)</p> <p>No objection&nbsp; can&nbsp; be set up to the legality of its provisions in the light of&nbsp; the precepts of our Commonwealth Constitution relating to the rights of accused&nbsp; under that Constitution, because&nbsp; the latter was not in force during the period of the Japanese military occupation,&nbsp; as we have already stated.&nbsp; Nor may said Constitution be applied upon its revival at the time of the re-occupation of&nbsp; the Philippines by&nbsp; virtue of the principle of&nbsp; postliminium because "a constitution&nbsp; should operate prospectively only, unless the words employed show a clear intention that it should have&nbsp; a retrospective effect" (Cooley's Constitutional&nbsp; Limitations, seventh edition, page&nbsp; 97, and cases quoted&nbsp; and cited in the footnote), especially as&nbsp; regards laws of procedure&nbsp; applied&nbsp; to cases already terminated completely.</p> <p>The only restrictions or limitations&nbsp; imposed upon the power of a belligerent occupant to alter the laws or promulgate new&nbsp; ones, especially the criminal law as well as the laws&nbsp; regarding procedure, so far&nbsp; as it is necessary for military purposes, that is, for his control of the territory and&nbsp; the safety and protection of his army, are those imposed by the Hague Regulations, the usages established by civilized nations, the laws of humanity and the requirements of public conscience.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious that the summary procedure under consideration does not violate those&nbsp; precepts.&nbsp; It cannot be considered as violating the&nbsp; laws of humanity and public conscience, for it is&nbsp; less objectionable,&nbsp; even from the point of view of those who are used to the accusatory system&nbsp; of criminal procedure than the procedural&nbsp; laws based on the semi-inquisitorial or&nbsp; mixed system prevailing in&nbsp; France and other countries in&nbsp; continental Europe.</p> <p>(2) The&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of the sentence rendered by the&nbsp; Court of Special and&nbsp; Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction which imposes life imprisonment upon the herein petitioner, depends upon the competence or power of the&nbsp; belligerent occupant to promulgate Act No. 65 which punishes the crime of which said&nbsp; petitioner was convicted.</p> <p>Westlake&nbsp; says that Article&nbsp; XLIII,&nbsp; Section III, of the Hague Conventions of 1907 "indicates that the laws to be enforced by the occupant consist of, first, the territorial law in general,&nbsp; as&nbsp; that which stands&nbsp; to the public order and social and commercial life of the district&nbsp; in a&nbsp; relation of mutual&nbsp; adaptation, so&nbsp; that any needless&nbsp; displacement of it would defeat the&nbsp; object which the&nbsp; invader is enjoined to have in view, and secondly, such variations&nbsp; of the territorial law as may&nbsp; be required by real necessity and are not expressly prohibited&nbsp; by any&nbsp; of the rules&nbsp; which will come before us.&nbsp; Such variations will naturally&nbsp; be greatest in what concerns the relation of the communities&nbsp; and individuals within the district to&nbsp; the&nbsp; invading army. and its followers,&nbsp; it being necessary for the protection of the latter, and&nbsp; for the unhindered prosecution of the&nbsp; war by them, that acts committed to their detriment shall not only Jose&nbsp; what justification the territorial law might give them. as committed&nbsp; against enemies,&nbsp; but shall be repressed more severely than the territorial law would repress acts committed against fellow subjects.&nbsp; Indeed the entire relation between the invaders and the invaded, so far as it may fall&nbsp; within&nbsp; the criminal&nbsp; department&nbsp; whether&nbsp; by&nbsp; the intrinsic nature&nbsp; of the acts done or in consequence&nbsp; of the regulations&nbsp; made by the&nbsp; invaders, may be considered as taken out of&nbsp; the territorial law and&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to what is called martial&nbsp; law."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Westlake,&nbsp; International&nbsp; Law, Part II, War, p. 96.)</p> <p>According to Hyde (International Law,&nbsp; Vol. II, p. 386), the term "martial law," in so far as it is&nbsp; used&nbsp; to describe any&nbsp; fact in relation to&nbsp; belligerent occupation, does not refer to a particular code or system of law, or to a special&nbsp; agency entrusted with its administration.&nbsp; The term merely signifies that the body of law actually applied, having the sanction of military&nbsp; authority, is&nbsp; essentially martial. All law, by whomsoever administered,&nbsp; in an occupied district is martial law; and it is none the less so when applied by the civil courts in matters devoid of special interest to the occupant.&nbsp; The words "martial law" are doubtless suggestive of the power of the occupant to share the law as he sees fit; that is, to determine what shall be deemed lawful or unlawful acts, to establish tests for ascertaining the guilt of offenders, to fix penalties, and generally to administer justice through such&nbsp; agencies as are found expedient.</p> <p>And the United States Rules of Land Warfare provide that the belligerent&nbsp; occupant may promulgate such new laws and regulations as military necessity demands, and in this class will be included those&nbsp; laws which come into being as a result of military rule; that is, those which establish new crimes and offenses incident to a&nbsp; state of war and are necessary for the control&nbsp; of the country and the protection of&nbsp; the army,&nbsp; for the principal&nbsp; object of&nbsp; the occupant is&nbsp; to provide for the security of the&nbsp; invading army and to contribute to its support and efficiency and the success of its&nbsp; operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pub. 1940, pp.&nbsp; 76, 77.)</p> <p>From the above it appears clear that it was within the power and competence of the belligerent occupant to promulgate, through the National Assembly of the&nbsp; so-called Republic of the Philippines, Act No.&nbsp; 65 of the said Assembly, which penalizes the crimes of robbery and other offenses by&nbsp; imprisonment ranging&nbsp; from the maximum period&nbsp; of the imprisonment prescribed by the laws and ordinances promulgated&nbsp; by the President of the so-called&nbsp; Republic as minimum, to life imprisonment or death as maximum. Although these crimes are&nbsp; defined in&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, they were altered and penalized&nbsp; by said Act No.&nbsp; 65 with different and&nbsp; heavier&nbsp; penalties, as new crimes and offenses demanded by military necessity, incident to a state of war, and necessary for the control of the country&nbsp; by the belligerent occupant,&nbsp; the protection and safety&nbsp; of the army of occupation,&nbsp; its support and efficiency,&nbsp; and the success of its&nbsp; operations.</p> <p>They are not the same ordinary offenses penalized by the Revised Penal Code.—The criminal&nbsp; acts penalized by said Act No. 65 are&nbsp; those committed by persons charged or connected with the supervision and control of the production, procurement and&nbsp; distribution of foods and other necessaries; and the&nbsp; penalties imposed upon the&nbsp; violators are different from and much heavier than those&nbsp; provided by the Revised Penal Code for the same ordinary crimes. The acts penalized by said Act were taken out of the territorial law or Revised Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; and&nbsp; referred to&nbsp; what is called martial law by international jurists, defined above by Hyde, in order, not only to prevent food and other necessaries from reaching the "guerrillas" which were harassing the belligerent occupant from every nook and corner of the country, but also to preserve the food supply and other necessaries in&nbsp; order that,&nbsp; in case of necessity, the Imperial Japanese forces could easily&nbsp; requisition&nbsp; them, as they did,&nbsp; and as they had the right to do in accordance with the law of nations for their maintenance and subsistence&nbsp; (Art. LII,&nbsp; Sec. Ill, Hague&nbsp; Conventions of 1907). Especially taking into consideration the fact, of which this court may take judicial notice, that the&nbsp; Imperial Japanese Army had depended mostly for their supply upon the&nbsp; produce&nbsp; of&nbsp; this country.</p> <p>The crimes penalized by Act No. 65—as well as the crimes against national security and&nbsp; the law of nations, to wit: treason, espionage, inciting to war, violation of neutrality, correspondence with hostile country, flight to enemy's country, piracy; and the&nbsp; crimes against public order,&nbsp; such as rebellion, sedition and disloyalty, illegal&nbsp; possession of firearms and other, penalized by Ordinance No. 7 and placed under the jurisdiction of the Court&nbsp; of Special&nbsp; and Exclusive Criminal&nbsp; Jurisdiction—are all of a political complexion, because the&nbsp; acts constituting those offenses were punished,&nbsp; as are all political offenses, for public rather than private reasons,&nbsp; and were acts&nbsp; in aid&nbsp; or&nbsp; favor of the enemy and directed against&nbsp; the welfare,&nbsp; safety&nbsp; and security of the belligerent occupant.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is&nbsp; true that these offenses, when committed against the Commonwealth or United States&nbsp; Government, are denned and also penalized , by the territorial law or Revised Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; they became inapplicable as crimes against the&nbsp; occupier upon the occupation of the Islands by the Japanese forces.&nbsp; And they had to be taken out of the territorial&nbsp; law and made punishable by said Ordinance No. 7, for they&nbsp; were&nbsp; not penalized before under the Revised Penal Code when committed against the belligerent occupant or the government established by him in these Islands.&nbsp; They are&nbsp; also conr sidered by some&nbsp; writers as war crimes in&nbsp; a broad sense. In&nbsp; this connection Wheaton&nbsp; observes the following:</p> <p>"Of 'war crimes' the number is naturally indefinite, depending as they do on the acts from time to time ordered to be&nbsp; done or forbidden to be done&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; martial&nbsp; law proclamation or regulations of the invading or occupying commander.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; in the Anglo-Boer war, the&nbsp; British military authorities proclaimed the following to be offenses against their martial&nbsp; law;—Being in&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of arms, ammunition, etc.; traveling without a permit;&nbsp; sending prohibited goods; holding meetings other than those allowed; using&nbsp; seditious&nbsp; language; spreading alarmist&nbsp;&nbsp; reports; overcharging&nbsp; for goods; wearing&nbsp; uniforms without&nbsp; due authority; going out of doors between certain hours; injuring military animals or stores; being in possession, without a permit, of horses, vehicles,&nbsp; cycles,&nbsp; etc.; hindering those in&nbsp; execution of&nbsp; military orders;&nbsp; trespassing&nbsp; on defense works. Such offenses, together with&nbsp; several&nbsp; others, were specified in the&nbsp; Japanese regulations&nbsp; made in the Russo-Japanese&nbsp;&nbsp; war."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Wheaton's&nbsp; International&nbsp; Law, War, seventh edition,&nbsp; 1944, p. 242.)</p> <p>It is, therefore,&nbsp; evident that the sentence&nbsp; rendered by the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction against the petitioner, imposing upon him the penalty of life imprisonment, was good and valid, since it was within the admitted power or competence of the belligerent occupant to promulgate the law penalizing the crime of which petitioner&nbsp; was convicted.</p> <p>(3)&nbsp; The last question is the legal effect of the reoccupation of the Philippines&nbsp; and restoration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Commonwealth Government; that is, whether or&nbsp; not,&nbsp; by the principle of postliminy, the punitive sentence which&nbsp; petitioner is now serving fell through or ceased to be valid&nbsp; from that time.</p> <p>In order to&nbsp; resolve this last question, it is not necessary to enter into an elaborate&nbsp; discussion on the matter.&nbsp; It is sufficient to quote the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; on the subject of several international jurists and our recent decision in the case of Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez&nbsp; Tan&nbsp; Ken and&nbsp; Dizon,&nbsp; supra.</p> <p>Hall, commenting on the effect of the principle of postiiminy upon sentences of the tribunals continued or created by the belligerent occupant, opines "that judicial acts done under&nbsp; this control, when they are not of a political complexion, administrative acts so done, to the extent that they take effect during the continuance of his control, and&nbsp; the various acts done during the same time by private persons under&nbsp; the sanction&nbsp; of&nbsp; municipal law,&nbsp; remain good. *&nbsp; * * Political acts&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand&nbsp; fall through as of course,&nbsp; whether they introduce any positive change into the organization of the country, or whether they only suspend the working of that already in existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; The execution also of punitive sentences ceases&nbsp; as&nbsp; of course when they have had reference to acts not criminal by&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; law of the state, such for&nbsp; example as acts directed against the&nbsp; security&nbsp; or control&nbsp; of the&nbsp; invader." (Hall's International Law, seventh edition,&nbsp; p. 518.)</p> <p>Westlake, speaking of the duration of the validity of punitive sentences for offenses such as the one in question, which is within the admitted power or competence of&nbsp; the belligerent occupant to punish, says that: "To the extent to which the legal power of the occupant is admitted he can make law for the duration of his occupation.&nbsp; Like any other legislator he is morally subject to the duty of giving sufficient notice of his enactments&nbsp; or regulations, not indeed so as to be debarred from carrying out his will without notice, when required by military necessity and so far as practically carrying out his will can be distinguished from punishment, but always remembering that to punish for breach of a regulation a person who was justifiably ignorant of it would be&nbsp; outrageous.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the law made by the occupant within his admitted power, whether morally justifiable or not, will bind any&nbsp; member of the&nbsp; occupied population as against any other member of it, and will bind as between them all and their national government, so far as it produces an effect during the&nbsp; occupation.&nbsp; When the occupation comes&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; end and&nbsp; the authority of the national government is restored, either by the progress of operations during the war or by the conclusion of a peace, no redress can be had for what has been actually carried out but nothing further can&nbsp; follow from the occupant's legislation.&nbsp; A prisoner detained under it must be released, and no civil right conferred by it can be further enforced. The enemy's law depends on him for enforcement as well as for enactment.&nbsp; The invaded state is not subject to the indignity&nbsp; of&nbsp; being&nbsp; obliged&nbsp; to&nbsp; execute&nbsp; his commands." (Westlake, International Law, Part II, War, pp. 97, 98.)</p> <p>And Wheaton, who, as above&nbsp; stated, considers as war crimes such offenses as those penalized in Ordinance No. 7 and&nbsp; Act No. 65,&nbsp; says:&nbsp; "In&nbsp; general, the cast of the occupant possess legal validity, and under international law should not be abrogated by the subsequent government. But this rule does not necessarily apply to acts that exceed the occupant's power (<em>e. g.</em>, alienation of the domains of the State or the sovereign), to sentences for 'war treason' <em>and 'war crimes,' to acts of a political character</em>, and to those that operate beyond the period of occupation.&nbsp; When occupation ceases, no reparation is&nbsp; legally due for what has already been carried out."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Wheaton's International Law, <em>supra</em>,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 245.)</p> <p>We have already held in our recent decision in the case of Co Kim Cham <em>vs. </em>Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, <em>supra</em>, that all judgments of political complexion of the courts during the Japanese regime, ceased to be valid upon the reoccupation of the islands by virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; the principle&nbsp; or right of postliminium.&nbsp; Applying that doctrine to&nbsp; the present case, the sentence&nbsp; which convicted&nbsp; the petitioner of a crime of a political complexion must be considered&nbsp; as having ceased to be valid <em>ipso facto upon the</em> reoccupation or liberation of the&nbsp; Philippines by General&nbsp; Douglas&nbsp; MacArthur.</p> <p>It may not be amiss to say in&nbsp; this connection that it is not necessary and proper to&nbsp; invoke the&nbsp; proclamation of General&nbsp; Douglas&nbsp; MacArthur&nbsp; declaring null and void&nbsp; all laws, among&nbsp; them Act No. 65, of the so-called Republic of the Philippines under which&nbsp; petitioner was convicted, in order to give retroactive effect to the nullification&nbsp; of said penal act and&nbsp; invalidate the punitive sentence&nbsp; rendered against petitioner under said law, a sentence which, before the proclamation, had already&nbsp; become null and of no effect.</p> <p>We therefore hold that the punitive sentence under consideration, although good and valid during the military occupation of the Philippines by the Japanese forces, ceased to be good and valid <em>ipso facto</em> upon&nbsp; the reoccupation of these Islands and the restoration therein&nbsp; of the Commonwealth Government.</p> <p>In view of all the foregoing, the writ of habeas corpus prayed&nbsp; for is hereby granted and it&nbsp; is ordered&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petitioner be&nbsp; released forthwith, without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; So ordered.</p> <p><em>Jaranilla, Pablo</em>, and <em>Bengzon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p> <p><em>MORAN, C.

The Solicitor General, answering the petition on behalf of the respondent Director of&nbsp; Prisons, expressed the opinion that "the acts and proceedings taken and had before the said Court of Special and Exclusive&nbsp; Criminal&nbsp; Jurisdiction which resulted in the conviction and imprisonment of the herein prisoner&nbsp; should&nbsp; now be denied&nbsp; force and&nbsp; efficacy," and recommended "that the writ of habeas corpus prayed for be granted&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the City&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; be instructed to prepare&nbsp; and file the corresponding&nbsp; information&nbsp; for rob- bery&nbsp; against the petitioner&nbsp; herein in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila."</p> <p>The case was argued before us on September 21 and 22, 1945, by the First Assistant Solicitor General on behalf of the respondent&nbsp; and the City Fiscal as&nbsp; <em>amicus curiæ</em>—the former impugning and the latter sustaining the validity of said Ordinance&nbsp; No. 7.</p> <p>Section 1 of the ordinance&nbsp; in question reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"SECTION 1.

S., 733; 19 Law. ed., 240.)&nbsp; Judicial or legislative acts in the insurrectionary states were valid where they were not hostile in their purpose or mode of enforcement&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of the national&nbsp; government, and did not impair the rights of citizens under the Constitution.&nbsp; (Horn <em>vs.</em> Lockhart, 17 Wall., 570-581.; 21. Law. ed., 660.)&nbsp;&nbsp; All the enactments of the <em>de facto</em> legislatures in the insurrectionary states during the war, which were not hostile to the Union or to the authority of the General Government and which were not in conflict with the&nbsp; Constitution of the United&nbsp; States,&nbsp; or&nbsp; of the states, have the same validity as if they had been enactments of legitimate legislatures.&nbsp;&nbsp; (United States <em>vs.</em> The Home Insurance Co.,&nbsp; 22 Wall., 99-104; 22 Law. ed., 818.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Tested iby these principles of international law, Ordinance No. 7 must be declared void&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; because&nbsp; it favored the&nbsp; forces of occupation and&nbsp; the&nbsp; civilian&nbsp; Japanese inasmuch as&nbsp; it provided an excessively heavy penalty for and the summary trial of possession of firearms and violations&nbsp; of food control&nbsp; regulations&nbsp; and (2) because it impaired the rights of citizens under the Constitution inasmuch as the procedure therein prescribed withdrew the privilege of the&nbsp; accused against self-incrimination and his right to appeal to the Supreme Court&nbsp; even where the penalty imposed was&nbsp; life imprisonment or death.</p> <p>In substance,&nbsp; the City Fiscal argues that the&nbsp; heavier penalty for the illegal&nbsp; possession of&nbsp; firearms&nbsp; than that fixed by the Administrative Code was not directed&nbsp; toward the suppression of underground&nbsp; activities against the Japanese army, and the rigid enforcement of the food&nbsp; control measures was not intended to insure the procurement of supplies by said army, because in any event the Japanese military occupant freely exercised the power to go after and&nbsp; punish&nbsp; his enemies directly without recurring to the agencies of the "Republic," for there were even cases where the offenders were already&nbsp; in the hands of the police or courts of the "Republic" but they were unceremoniously taken from said agencies by the Japanese military police and punished or liquidated by it at Fort Santiago or elsewhere;&nbsp; and as regards food control, the Japanese forces did not have any need of the measures or agencies established by the "Republic" because the Japanese forces themselves commandeered what&nbsp; they needed or sent put their own agents to purchase it for them at&nbsp; prices even much higher than those fixed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; "Republic";&nbsp; that the procedure prescribed afforded a fair trial and did not violate any fundamental rights; that the military occupant was not in duty 'bound to respect the constitution and the laws of the occupied territory; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; could abrogate&nbsp; all of them and promulgate new ones if he so chose; that the cases cited by the Solicitor General are&nbsp; not&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; because they deal with the validity of acts and processes of the governments of the rebel states during the Civil War and are based upon the indissolubility of the Union; that the validity or nullity of the ordinance in question should be judged&nbsp; in the light of&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of the Constitution and&nbsp; the laws of the&nbsp; "Republic"&nbsp; and of generally accepted principles of international law; that even assuming that it should be judged by&nbsp; the&nbsp; standard&nbsp; of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, the ordinance satisfies all the&nbsp; requirements of said Constitution; that the right to appeal in a criminal case is not a constitutional but a purely statutory right which may be granted or withheld&nbsp; at the pleasure of the state; and, finally, that the&nbsp; supposed invalidity of the sentence imposed against the petitioner cannot be raised by habeas corpus.</p> <p>There is no question&nbsp; that in virtue of the proclamation of General MacArthur of October 23,&nbsp; 1944 (41 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 147, 148),&nbsp; Ordinance No. 7 is no longer of any force and effect since the restoration of the Government of the&nbsp; Commonwealth of the Philippines.&nbsp; The question before us is whether said ordinance ever acquired any force and&nbsp; effect or was&nbsp; null and void <em>ab&nbsp; initio</em>.</p> <p>Invoking decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in cases involving the validity of Acts of the Confederacy and of a rebel state&nbsp; as a <em>de facto </em>government during the Civil War, the Solicitor General maintains that the ordinance in&nbsp; question was null and void because it impaired the rights of citizens under the Constitution and because it was hostile in its purpose to the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines.</p> <p>The decisions invoked&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; applicable if the so-called Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines should be considered as a government established by the Filipino people in rebellion against the&nbsp; Commonwealth and&nbsp; the&nbsp; sovereignty of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States declaring invalid Acts&nbsp; of a&nbsp; rebel state&nbsp; or of the Confederacy which were in furtherance or support of rebellion against&nbsp; the United States or which&nbsp; impaired the rights of citizens under the&nbsp; Constitution, rest on the proposition that the Union is perpetual and indissoluble and that the obligations of allegiance to the state, and obedience to her laws, subject to the Constitution of the United States, remained unimpaired during the&nbsp; War&nbsp; of Secession.&nbsp;&nbsp; (<em>See</em> Texas <em>vs.</em> White,&nbsp; 74 U. S., 700; 19 Law.&nbsp; ed., 227,&nbsp; 237; Williams <em>vs.</em> Bruffy,&nbsp; 96 U. S., 176; 24 Law. ed.. 716.)&nbsp; Obviously, that proposition does not hold true with respect to a <em>de&nbsp; facto</em> government established&nbsp; by the enemy in&nbsp; an invaded&nbsp; and occupied territory&nbsp; in the course of a war between&nbsp; two independent nations.&nbsp; Such territory is possessed temporarily by&nbsp; lawful&nbsp; government at war&nbsp; with the country of which the territory so possessed is a part, and during that possession&nbsp; the obligations of the inhabitants to their country are suspended, although not abrogated. (United States <em>vs.</em> Rice, 4 Wheat., 253; Fleming<em> vs.</em> Page, 9 How.,&nbsp; 614; Baldy<em> vs.</em> Hunter,&nbsp; 171 U. S., 388; 43 Law. ed., 208, 210.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Williams <em>vs.</em> Bruffy, <em>supra</em>, the court, speaking through Mr.&nbsp; Justice Field, observed: "The&nbsp; rule&nbsp; stated by Vattel, that the justice of the&nbsp; cause between two enemies being by the law of nations reputed' to be equal, whatsoever is permitted to the one in virtue of war is also permitted to the other, applies only to cases of regular war between independent nations.&nbsp; It has no application to the case of a war between an established government and insurgents seeking to withdraw themselves from its jurisdiction or to&nbsp; overthrow its&nbsp; authority.&nbsp; The court further stated that the concession of belligerent rights made to the Confederate Government sanctioned no hostile legislation and impaired in no respect the rights of loyal citizens&nbsp; as&nbsp; they&nbsp; had existed at the commencement of hostilities.</p> <p>On the other hand, in a war between independent nations "the&nbsp; rights of the&nbsp; occupant as a&nbsp; law-giver&nbsp; have broad scope."&nbsp;&nbsp; He may "suspend the existing laws and promulgate new ones when the exigencies of the military service demand&nbsp; such action,&nbsp; According to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of&nbsp; Land Warfare he will naturally alter&nbsp; or&nbsp; suspend all laws&nbsp; of a political nature as well as political privileges, and all&nbsp; laws which affect the&nbsp; welfare&nbsp; and&nbsp; safety&nbsp; of&nbsp; his command." (Hyde on International Law, vol. 2, p. 367.)&nbsp; It will be seen then that in a&nbsp; war between independent nations the army of occupation&nbsp; has the&nbsp; right to enact laws and&nbsp; take measures hostile to its enemy, for its purpose was to harass and&nbsp; subdue the latter; and it is not bound to respect or preserve the rights of the citizens of the occupied territory under their Constitution.</p> <p>Let us now look into the nature and status of the&nbsp; government styled "Republic of the Philippines" in order to determine the criterion by which the validity of its enactments should be tested.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; recent case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Co&nbsp; Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (G. R. No.&nbsp; L-5, p. 113,&nbsp; ante),&nbsp; this Court,&nbsp; speaking through Justice&nbsp; Feria, had&nbsp; occasion to&nbsp; comment upon&nbsp; the nature of said&nbsp; government in the following words:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The so-called Kepublic of the&nbsp; Philippines, apparently established and organized as a sovereign state independent from any other government by the Filipino people, was, in truth and reality, a government established by the belligerent occupant or the Japanese forces of occupation. It was&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; character as the Philippine Executive&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; and the ultimate source of its authority was the same—the Japanese military authority and government.&nbsp; As General MacArthur&nbsp; stated in his proclamation&nbsp; of October 23, 1944, a portion&nbsp; of which had been already quoted,&nbsp; 'under enemy&nbsp; duress a so-called government styled as the "Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines" was established&nbsp; on October 14, 1943, based upon neither&nbsp; the free expression of the peoples' will nor the sanction of the Government of the United States.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan had&nbsp; no legal power to grant independence to the Philippines or transfer the sovereignty of the United States to, or recognize&nbsp; the latent sovereignty of, the Filipino people, before&nbsp; its military occupation&nbsp; and possession of the&nbsp; Islands had matured into an absolute and permanent dominion or sovereignty by a treaty of peace or&nbsp; other means recognized in the law of nations. For it is a well-established doctrine in international law, recognized in Article 45 of the Hague Conventions of 1907 (which&nbsp; prohibits compulsion of the population of the occupied territory to swear allegiance to&nbsp; the hostile&nbsp; power), that belligerent&nbsp; occupation,&nbsp; <em>being essentially provisional</em>,&nbsp; does not serve to transfer sovereignty over the territory&nbsp; controlled although the <em>de jure</em> government is during the period of occupancy deprived of the power to exercise its rights as&nbsp; such.&nbsp; (Thirty Hogshead of&nbsp; Sugar <em>vs.</em> Boyle, 9&nbsp; Cranch, 191; United States <em>vs.</em> Rice,&nbsp; 4 Wheat., 246; Fleming <em>vs.</em> Page, 9 Howard, 603; Downes <em>vs.</em> Bidwell, 182 U. S., 345.)&nbsp; The formation of the Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines was a scheme contrived by Japan to delude the Filipino people into believing in the&nbsp; apparent magnanimity of the Japanese gesture of transferring or turning over the rights of government into the hands of Filipinos.&nbsp; It was&nbsp; established under the mistaken belief that, by doing so, Japan would secure the&nbsp; cooperation or&nbsp; at&nbsp; least the neutrality of the&nbsp; Filipino people in her war against the United States and other allied nations."</p> </blockquote> <p>We&nbsp; reaffirmed those&nbsp; statements.&nbsp; To show&nbsp; further the fictitious character of the&nbsp; much-propagandized&nbsp; "independence"&nbsp; which Japan&nbsp; purported to grant to the&nbsp; Philippines through the establishment of the "Republic," we may add that, as a matter of contemporary history and&nbsp; of common knowledge, in&nbsp; practice the Japanese military authorities in the Philippines never treated the "Republic of the Philippines" as an independent government after its inauguration. They continued to impose their will on its executive officials when their interests so required.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Japanese military police arrested and punished various high officials of said government, including the First Assistant Solicitor General, and paid no attention to the protests and representations made on their behalf&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; President of&nbsp; the "Republic."&nbsp; As a&nbsp; climax of their continual&nbsp; impositions, in December 1944 the Japanese military authorities placed the President&nbsp; and the members of his&nbsp; Cabinet&nbsp; under the "protective" custody of the military police, and on the 22nd of that month forced them to leave&nbsp; the seat of government in Manila and hide&nbsp; with them in the mountains.&nbsp; The only measure&nbsp; they&nbsp; did not succeed in imposing upon the "Republic" was the conscription of the Filipino youth into an army&nbsp; to fight with the Japanese against the United States.&nbsp; So, while in theory and for the purpose of propaganda Japan professed to be a benefactor and liberator of the Filipinos, hoping thereby to secure their willing cooperation in her&nbsp; war efforts,&nbsp; in practice&nbsp; she continued to enslave and oppress the Filipinos, as she saw that the latter remained&nbsp; loyal to the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; She found that the Filipinos&nbsp; merely&nbsp; feigned cooperation&nbsp; as their only means of self-preservation and that those&nbsp; who could stay beyond the reach of her army of occupation manifested their hostility by harassing and attacking that army.&nbsp; Thus Japan continued to oppress&nbsp; and tyrannize the Filipinos notwithstanding the former's grant of "independence" to the latter. It would therefore be preposterous to declare that the "Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines" was a government established by the&nbsp; Filipino people&nbsp; in rebellion against the Commonwealth and&nbsp; the sovereignly of the United States.</p> <p>The said&nbsp; government&nbsp; being a mere&nbsp; instrumentality of the Commander in Chief of the Japanese army as military occupant, the ordinance in&nbsp; question promulgated by the President of the&nbsp; "Republic"&nbsp; must&nbsp; be deemed&nbsp; as an act emanating from the power or authority&nbsp; of said occupant. The question, therefore, is whether or not it was within the competence of&nbsp; the military occupant&nbsp; to pass such a law.</p> <p>Article 43 of the Hague Regulations provides as follows;</p> <blockquote> <p>"ART. 43. The authority of the legitimate power having actually passed into&nbsp; the hands of the occupant,&nbsp; the latter shall take aB steps in his power&nbsp; to reestablish and insure, as far as possible, public order and safety,&nbsp; while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country."</p> </blockquote> <p>Commenting upon this article, Hyde in his work on International&nbsp; Law, volume&nbsp; 2, pages 366,&nbsp; 367,&nbsp; 368, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>"In consequence of his acquisition of the power to&nbsp; control the territory&nbsp; concerned, the occupant enjoys the right and is burdened with the&nbsp; duty to take all&nbsp; the measures within his power to restore and insure public&nbsp; order and safety. In so doing&nbsp; he is given&nbsp; great latitude with respect to choice of means and mode of procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; This freedom may&nbsp; be partly due to the circumstance&nbsp; that the occupant is obliged to consider as a principal object the security,&nbsp; support, efficiency&nbsp; and success of his&nbsp; own force in a hostile&nbsp; land inhabited by nationals of&nbsp; the enemy.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p> <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>"The right&nbsp; to legislate is not deemed to be unlimited. According to the&nbsp; Hague Eegulations of 1907, the occupant&nbsp; is called upon to respect, 'unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country Thus in restoring&nbsp; public order and safety he appears to be&nbsp; bound to make serious endeavor to continue&nbsp; in force the ordinary&nbsp; civil and criminal laws which do not conflict with the&nbsp; security of his&nbsp; army or its support, efficacy, and success."</p> </blockquote> <p>In the exercise&nbsp; of his powers the commander must be guided by&nbsp; his judgment and&nbsp; his&nbsp; experience and&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; high sense of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; (President McKinley, Order to the&nbsp; Secretary of War, July&nbsp; 18, 1898, on the occupation of Santiago de&nbsp; Cuba by the American forces, Moore, Dig. VII, p. 261.)</p> <p>Acts&nbsp; of the military occupant which exceed his power tested by the criterion set forth in article 43 of the Hague Regulations,&nbsp; are null&nbsp; and&nbsp; without&nbsp; effect as&nbsp; against the legitimate&nbsp; government.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Wheaton's&nbsp;&nbsp; International&nbsp; Law, 7th ed.&nbsp; [1944], p. 245.)</p> <p>Hall in his Treatise on International Law (7th edition), discussing the extent of the right of a military occupant, states:</p> <blockquote> <p>"If occupation is merely a phase&nbsp; in military operations, and implies no&nbsp; change in the&nbsp; legal position of&nbsp; the invader with respect to the occupied territory and its inhabitants, the rights&nbsp; which&nbsp; he possesses over them are those&nbsp; which in&nbsp; the special&nbsp; circumstances represent his general right to do whatever acts are necessary for the prosecution of his war; in other words he has the&nbsp; right of exercising such control, and such control only, within the occupied territory, as is required for his safety and the success of his operations. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; On occupying a country an invader&nbsp; at once invests himself with absolute authority; and the&nbsp; fact of&nbsp; occupation draws with it as of&nbsp; course the&nbsp; substitution of his will for previously existing law whenever such substitution is reasonably needed, and also the replacement of&nbsp; the actual civil&nbsp; and&nbsp; judicial administration by military jurisdiction.&nbsp; In its&nbsp; exercise however this ultimate&nbsp; authority is&nbsp; governed by&nbsp; the condition that the invader, having only a right to such control as is necessary for his safety and the success&nbsp; of his operations, must use his&nbsp; power within the limits&nbsp; defined by the fundamental&nbsp; notion of occupation, and with due reference to its transient character.&nbsp; He is therefore forbidden as a general rule to vary or suspend laws&nbsp; affecting&nbsp; property and private personal relations, or&nbsp; which regulate&nbsp; the&nbsp; moral order of the community. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pages 498, 499.)</p> </blockquote> <p>We&nbsp; deduce&nbsp; from the authorities that the power of the occupant is broad&nbsp; and absolute&nbsp; in&nbsp; matters&nbsp; affecting his safety.&nbsp; But in&nbsp; affairs which do&nbsp; not affect&nbsp; the security, efficacy,&nbsp; and success of his military&nbsp; operations, his power is&nbsp; qualified&nbsp; by the transient character&nbsp; of his administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is forbidden&nbsp; "to vary or suspend laws affecting property and private personal relations, or which regulate the moral order of the community."&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless absolutely prevented, he is bound to respect the laws, civil and criminal, in force in the country.</p> <p>Tested by this criterion, was it within the power or competence of the Commander in Chief, of the Japanese army of occupation of the Philippines to promulgate Ordinance No. 7?&nbsp;&nbsp; In so far as said ordinance created new court of special criminal jurisdiction we think his power to promulgate and enforce it during the occupation cannot be seriously disputed; but in so far as that ordinance varied radically our law of criminal procedure and deprived the accused&nbsp; of certain&nbsp; rights which our people have&nbsp; always. treasured and considered inviolate, we are of the opinion that it&nbsp; transcended his&nbsp; power&nbsp; or&nbsp; competence.&nbsp; We base, this opinion&nbsp; upon the following considerations:</p> <ol> <li>The occupant&nbsp; was&nbsp; not absolutely prevented from respecting our law of criminal procedure and applying it in the Court of Special and Exclusive&nbsp; Criminal Jurisdiction. The application&nbsp; or&nbsp; nonapplication of said&nbsp; law did not affect the security,&nbsp; efficacy, and success of his military operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crimes over which the&nbsp; said court was vested with&nbsp; jurisdiction were mostly crimes against property penalized in our Revised Penal Code, which crimes did not affect the army of occupation.&nbsp; As to the illegal possession of firearms the City Fiscal himself, who sustains the validity&nbsp; of the ordinance, informs us that the occupant did not avail himself of said court&nbsp; but&nbsp; punished his enemies&nbsp; direct&nbsp; without recurring to&nbsp; the agencies&nbsp; of&nbsp; the "Republic"; and&nbsp; he further informs us that&nbsp; "as regards food control, the Japanese forces did not have any need of the measures or agencies&nbsp; established&nbsp; by "Republic",&nbsp; nor did they make use of them.<p></p> <br> <br> </li><li>The summary procedure prescribed in Ordinance No. 7 was inquisitorial, repugnant to&nbsp; the humanitarian method of administering criminal justice adopted&nbsp; by&nbsp; all progressive, democratic, and freedom-loving countries of the world, and , therefore, devoid of that high sense of justice by which the military&nbsp; occupant must&nbsp; be guided in the exercise of his powers.&nbsp; This concept is, we think, borne out by&nbsp; an examination of the following features of said procedure: <p></p> <p>(<em>a</em>)&nbsp; Under the rule&nbsp; of procedure embodied in said&nbsp; ordinance&nbsp; any prosecuting officer may, on his own volition and even&nbsp; without probable cause, issue a search warrant for the seizure of documents and articles&nbsp; which may&nbsp; be regarded as evidence of an offense—in violation of section 2, Rule 122 of the Rules of Court and of the Bill&nbsp; of Rights contained in the Constitution of the Commonwealth, which guarantees "the right of the people to be secure in&nbsp; their persons, houses, papers, and&nbsp; effects against unreasonable searches&nbsp; and seizures,"&nbsp; and&nbsp; prohibits&nbsp; the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of warrants&nbsp; except upon&nbsp; probable cause <em>to be determined by the judge</em> after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce.</p> <p>(<em>b</em>)&nbsp; The trial must be commenced <em>within</em> two days&nbsp; <em>after the filing of the information</em>—in violation of section 7, Rule 114, which gives the accused <em>at least</em> two days <em>after the plea</em> of not guilty within which to prepare for trial.</p> <p>(<em>c</em>)&nbsp; The presumption of innocence in favor of the accused in all criminal prosecutions&nbsp; until the&nbsp; contrary is proved, which&nbsp; is&nbsp; likewise guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, is violated in that, after the&nbsp; arraignment and before the presentation&nbsp; of any proof for the prosecution, the accused is interrogated by the judge as&nbsp; to the facts and circumstances of the case, and if from the facts&nbsp; obtained by such interrogation&nbsp; it should appear&nbsp; (to the&nbsp; judge)&nbsp; that the accused is guilty a sentence of conviction&nbsp; may be immediately rendered against him, thereby also depriving him of his right&nbsp; to&nbsp; meet the witnesses face to&nbsp; face and of his privilege&nbsp; against self-incrimination.</p> <p>The City Fiscal justifies&nbsp; this feature of&nbsp; the procedure by giving the following hypothetical case:&nbsp; "In the&nbsp; house of Juan and under his bed a policeman finds a revolver.&nbsp;&nbsp; Juan is arrested and an information for illegal possession of firearms is filed against him by the fiscal&nbsp; He is brought before the judge&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; special court for the preliminary interrogatory.&nbsp; He is asked whether&nbsp; or not he admits that the revolver was found&nbsp; in his house. He answers in the affirmative but says that&nbsp; he is not the owner of the revolver and he does not know how it was placed there.&nbsp; Asked whether he knows of anybody who could have placed the revolver under his bed, he answers that it might have been placed there by a guest who slept on his bed the night previous to its discovery&nbsp; by the police. He is asked to&nbsp; give the name of&nbsp; the guest referred&nbsp; to and his address, but he refuses to answer.&nbsp; Asked if&nbsp; he has other witnesses to support his claim, he&nbsp; answers that he has none. As may be seen, the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; guilt is complete, and there&nbsp; being no further evidence to be presented that may change&nbsp; the result the accused&nbsp; may&nbsp; be then and&nbsp; there sentenced by the court.&nbsp; In this case, the conviction of the accused is reasonable and&nbsp; fair, for his refusal to reveal the identity of his alleged guest may&nbsp; be due, either to the fact that there was no such guest, or that the cause for concealing his identity is worth suffering for. <em>Volenti non fit injuria</em>."</p> <p>But to us that hypothetical case is a good illustration of the injustice of&nbsp; such procedure. There&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused was convicted not because the prosecution had proved his guilt but because&nbsp; he&nbsp; was unable to prove his innocence.&nbsp; His inability to prove who the owner of the revolver was, did not to our mind&nbsp; prove him guilty ibeyond reasonable doubt, under the circumstances.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; accused of illegal possession of firearm, an&nbsp; offense punishable under the ordinance in&nbsp; question with&nbsp; imprisonment for six to&nbsp; twelve years. He pleaded not guilty, for according to him the revolver was not his and he did not know how it got into his house. He had no time to investigate and&nbsp; try to find out whether&nbsp; the policeman himself or some&nbsp; other person who wished to do him harm had planted it there, for no sooner was the revolver seized than&nbsp; he was&nbsp; brought before the court and interrogated about it when&nbsp; he was naturally dazed and in a state&nbsp; of alarm.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the law of criminal procedure had been followed,&nbsp; he would&nbsp; have had ample time to reflect and&nbsp; endeavor to unravel&nbsp; the mystery.&nbsp; He could have consulted a lawyer, and&nbsp; he&nbsp; would have&nbsp; been entitled to at least&nbsp; two days&nbsp; after the&nbsp; information was read to him&nbsp; to investigate the facts&nbsp; and prepare for the trial.&nbsp; At the trial&nbsp; he&nbsp; would&nbsp; not have&nbsp; been required to answer any question or present&nbsp; any proof in his defense until the&nbsp; prosecution had presented its witnesses, principally the policeman.&nbsp;&nbsp; His lawyer could have cross-examined the policeman and found out from him whether he had any grudge against the accused and how&nbsp; he happened to search&nbsp; the latter's house.&nbsp; From the testimony of the policeman the accused might have been&nbsp; enlightened as to how and by&nbsp; whom the revolver was placed in his house. Suppose that the policeman should say that his informant as to the presence of the revolver under the bed of the accused was a houseboy of the latter, and&nbsp; suppose that that houseboy was really the one who planted the&nbsp; revolver because of some grievance he had against his master but that the latter had not suspected before that his houseboy had any revolver.&nbsp; In view of the&nbsp; revelation&nbsp; of the policeman he would have been able to investigate and ascertain that fact.&nbsp; In that way he&nbsp; cpuld have satisfactorily explained how and by whom the&nbsp; revolver was placed under his bed. But under the procedure&nbsp; in question as&nbsp; outlined by the City Fiscal, the accused was&nbsp; of course utterly&nbsp; unable to do that and was consequently doomed to at least&nbsp; six years' imprisonment for a crime he had not committed.</p> <p>(<em>d</em>) Section 6 of the Ordinance in question provided: "The decisions of the&nbsp; special&nbsp; courts herein created&nbsp; shall be final except where the penalty imposed is death, in which case the records of the particular case shall be&nbsp; elevated <em>en consulta</em> to a special&nbsp; division of the Supreme Court composed of three members to be designated by the President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines."&nbsp; Under our law of criminal procedure, which the military occupant was bound to respect unless absolutely prevented,&nbsp; all persons accused of any offense have the right to appeal to the Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; It is true that as a rule that right is&nbsp; statutory and may be withdrawn by the legislature except in certain cases where the right to appeal is provided in the Constitution itself, as in the cases involving life&nbsp; imprisonment and death penalty; but&nbsp; the question here is not whether the legislative department of the legitimate government has the power to abrogate that right but&nbsp; whether it was&nbsp; within the&nbsp; competence of&nbsp; the military occupant to do so.</p> <p>(<em>e</em>)&nbsp; In the instant case the penalty imposed upon the accused&nbsp; by the special&nbsp; court, after a summary trial,&nbsp; was <em>life imprisonment</em>, and he was denied the right to have that sentence reviewed by the Supreme Court, altho under subsection 4, section 2, Article VIII of the&nbsp; Constitution of the Commonwealth, he could not have been deprived by law of that right.</p> <p>(<em>f</em>)&nbsp; Section 7 of the Ordinance suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus <em>with respect to&nbsp; persons accused of or under investigation for any of the crimes and offenses enumerated in sections 1 and 2</em>.&nbsp; The Constitution of the Commonwealth prohibits th§ suspension of that privilege except in cases of invasion, insurrection,&nbsp; or rebellion when&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; safety requires it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; suspension by the ordinance was not motivated by any one&nbsp; of these cases but by the necessity for waging a campaign against certain classes&nbsp; of crimes; martial&nbsp; law was not declared;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the suspension of <em>habeas corpus</em> did not apply to all persons living&nbsp; in the specified territory (as should have been done if the public&nbsp; safety&nbsp; required such&nbsp; suspension)&nbsp; but only to those accused of or investigated&nbsp; for certain specified crimes or offenses.&nbsp; The result of such partial suspension was&nbsp; that persons accused of or&nbsp; under investigation&nbsp; for any&nbsp; of the offenses&nbsp; specified in&nbsp; sections 1 and&nbsp; 2 could be held in detention indefinitely,&nbsp; whereas persons accused of or under investigation for crimes other than those specified, such for example as&nbsp; theft, physical injuries, homicide, murder, and parricide, had the right to demand their release by <em>habeas corpus</em> after the lapse of six hours.&nbsp; The same discrimination&nbsp; holds true with reference to the other features already noted above, namely, unreasonable searches and seizures, summary trial, denial of the presumption if innocence,&nbsp; self-incrimination,&nbsp; and denial of the right to appeal.&nbsp; Such discrimination was unwarranted&nbsp; and unjust and was contrary to the concept of justice prevailing in all democratic countries,&nbsp; where every person is entitled to the equal protection of the&nbsp; laws.</p> </li><li>It&nbsp; is apparent from the foregoing examination of the main features of the&nbsp; ordinance that while the methods thus adopted may not be unusual under totalitarian governments like those of the&nbsp; aggressor nations&nbsp; in the recent global war, they are strange and repugnant to the people of the democratic countries which&nbsp; united together&nbsp; to defeat said aggressors and "to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the&nbsp; dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women&nbsp; and of nations large and small,&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to promote social progress and better standards&nbsp; of&nbsp; life in&nbsp; larger freedom."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Preamble Charter&nbsp; for Peace adopted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the United&nbsp; Nations&nbsp; at San&nbsp; Francisco,&nbsp; California,&nbsp; June&nbsp; 26, 1945.)&nbsp; The recent global war was a clash between two antagonistic ways of life, between facism&nbsp; and democracy.&nbsp; It would be&nbsp; strange indeed if this Court,&nbsp; which&nbsp; functions under a democratic government that fought with the other democratic nations in that&nbsp; war,&nbsp; should sanction or approve the way&nbsp; of life, against&nbsp; which that war was fought and won at the cost of millions of lives and untold sacrifices.<p></p> <br> <br> </li><li>The case involves the&nbsp; interpretation not&nbsp; of constitutional but of international law, which "is based on usage and opinion"; and "he who in such a case bases his reasoning on&nbsp; high&nbsp; considerations&nbsp; of morality may&nbsp; succeed&nbsp; in resolving the&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with humanity and justice."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Principles of International Law, Lawrence, 7th ed., pp. 12, 13.)&nbsp; We think the contentions for the petitioner against the validity&nbsp; of the&nbsp; ordinance&nbsp; in&nbsp; question are in accord with humanity and justice.<p></p></li></ol> <p>Before&nbsp; concluding&nbsp; this&nbsp; opinion we deem it pertinent to comment&nbsp; on the remark of the City Fiscal that, as stated in&nbsp; its preamble, the ordinance in&nbsp; question was promulgated in response to "an urgent necessity for waging an immediate and relentless&nbsp; campaign against certain classes of&nbsp; crimes&nbsp; and offenses and expediting the trial and determination thereof&nbsp; in order to hasten the&nbsp; re-establishment of peace and order&nbsp; throughout the country and promote a feeling of security among the people conducive to the earlier return of normalcy in our national&nbsp; life."&nbsp; We concede that the objective of the author of the ordinance was commendable,&nbsp; but we think—and in this we are supported by the actual&nbsp; result—it was unattainable thru the means and methods prescribed in&nbsp; said ordinance.&nbsp; Peace and order and normalcy could not be restored&nbsp; unless the root cause of their disturbance were eliminated first.&nbsp; That cause was the presence in the country of the Japanese army,&nbsp; which&nbsp; wrecked our political, social, and economic structures, destroyed&nbsp; our means of&nbsp; communication, robbed the people of&nbsp; their food, clothing, and medicine and other necessities of life, ejected&nbsp; them from their&nbsp; own&nbsp; homes, punished and tortured innocent men and women,&nbsp; and otherwise made life unbearable.&nbsp; The relative rampancy of the crimes mentioned in&nbsp; said ordinance was but the effect of that cause.&nbsp; The&nbsp; cornering&nbsp; and&nbsp; hoarding of&nbsp; foodstuffs would not have occurred were it not for the scarcity produced by&nbsp; the&nbsp; seizures and requisitions made&nbsp; by the Japanese army and the&nbsp; disruption of&nbsp; our commerce and industries on account of the invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The possession&nbsp; of firearms was rendered desirable to many persons to defend themselves against&nbsp; or attack the invader.&nbsp; Robberies and other crimes&nbsp; against property&nbsp; increased&nbsp; as&nbsp; a result&nbsp; of hunger&nbsp; and privation to which the people were subjected by the rapacity of the Japanese.&nbsp; It was a delusion to expect peace and normalcy to return without eliminating the cause of&nbsp; their&nbsp; disturbance; and&nbsp; the elimination of that cause meant the expulsion or destruction of the Japanese army in the Philippines—an objective to which the ordinance was not addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, even from the point of view of the Filipino people&nbsp; and not of the Japanese army of occupation, the ordinance in question results untenable.</p> <p>Having&nbsp; reached&nbsp; the&nbsp; conclusion that the&nbsp; enactment of the procedure embodied in said ordinance for the special court therein created was beyond the competence of the occupant, inasmuch as that procedure was inseperable from the first part of the ordinance which creates the special court and&nbsp; prescribes&nbsp; the jurisdiction thereof, we are constrained&nbsp; to declare the whole ordinance null and void <em>ab initio</em>.&nbsp; Consequently the&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; in said court which resulted&nbsp; in the&nbsp; conviction and sentence of the petitioner are also void.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><em>CONCURRING IN THE RESULT</em></p> <p><strong>PARAS, J.,</strong></p> <p>Charged with robbery,&nbsp;

criminal&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 66 of the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal&nbsp; Jurisdiction,&nbsp; established in the City&nbsp; of Manila, during Japanese occupation, under the authority of Ordinance No. 7, issued by the President of the so-called Philippine Republic, and the effect on said&nbsp; proceedings of the proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur, dated October 23, 1944.</p> <p>In&nbsp; said criminal case, herein petitioner&nbsp; was accused&nbsp; of the crime of robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment, on August 21, 1944.</p> <p>There can&nbsp; be&nbsp; no doubt that the government established in this country by the Commander in Chief&nbsp; of the Japanese Imperial forces,&nbsp; under the name of the Philippine Executive Commission,&nbsp; was&nbsp; a <em>de facto government</em>, as already held by this Court in civil case G. R. No. L-5, entitled Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, decided on September 17,1945 (p. 113, <em>ante</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Said government&nbsp; possessed all the characteristics of a <em>de facto</em> government, as defined by the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of the United States, in the following language:</p> <blockquote> <p>"But there is another description of government, called also&nbsp; by publicists a government<em> de facto</em>, but which might, perhaps, be more aptly denominated&nbsp; a <em>government of paramount force</em>.&nbsp; Its distinguishing characteristics are (1), that its existence is maintained&nbsp; by active military power within the territories, and against the rightful authority of an established and lawful government; and (2), that while it exist&nbsp; it must necessarily&nbsp; be obeyed in&nbsp; civil matters&nbsp; by private citizens who,&nbsp; by acts of obedience&nbsp; rendered in submission&nbsp; to such force, do not become responsible, as wrongdoers, for&nbsp; those acts, though&nbsp; not warranted by the laws of the rightful&nbsp; government. Actual governments of this&nbsp; sort are established&nbsp; over&nbsp; districts differing greatly&nbsp; in extent and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; are usually&nbsp; administered directly by military authority, but&nbsp; they may&nbsp; be administered, also, by civil authority, supported more or less directly hy military force.' (MacLeod<em> vs.</em> United&nbsp; States&nbsp; [1913,] 229 U. S., 416.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Under a <em>de facto</em> government, the courts of the country, under military occupation, should be kept open, and wherever practicable, the&nbsp; subordinate officers of the local administration should be allowed to continue in their&nbsp; functions,&nbsp; supported by&nbsp; the&nbsp; military force of the&nbsp; invader, because the responsibility of maintaining peace and public order,&nbsp; and of punishing crime, falls directly upon the commander in chief of the occupying forces.&nbsp; And in the performance of this duty, he may make use of the local courts, wholly or in part; or he may proclaim martial law (Davis, Elements of International Law [3d&nbsp; ed.], pp. 330-332).</p> <p>In occupied territory, the conquering power has a right to displace the pre-existing authority, and to assume to such extent as it may deem proper the exercise by itself of all the powers and&nbsp; functions of government.&nbsp; It may appoint all&nbsp; the necessary officers and clothe them with designated powers, according&nbsp; to&nbsp; its&nbsp; pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may&nbsp; prescribe the revenues&nbsp; to be paid, and apply them to its own use or otherwise.&nbsp; It may do anything necessary to strengthen&nbsp; itself and weaken the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no limit to the powers that may be exerted&nbsp; in such cases,&nbsp; save those which are found&nbsp; in&nbsp; the laws and customs and usages of war (Cross <em>vs.</em> Harrison, 16 How.,&nbsp; 164; Leitensdorfer&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Webb, 20 Id.,&nbsp; 176;&nbsp; The Grapeshot, 9 Wall.&nbsp; [U.&nbsp; S.],&nbsp; 129; New Orleans <em>vs.</em> Steamship Co., [1874], 20 Wall., [U. S.], 287).</p> <p>It is generally the better&nbsp; course&nbsp; for the inhabitants of the territory, under military&nbsp; occupation, that&nbsp; they should continue to carry on the ordinary&nbsp; administration under the invader; but the latter has no right to force them to do so. If they decline,&nbsp; his only rights, and&nbsp; it is also&nbsp; his duty,&nbsp; is to replace them by appointees&nbsp; of his own, so far as necessary for&nbsp; maintaining order and the&nbsp; continuance of the daily life of the territory: other purposes, as these of the superior&nbsp; judicial offices,&nbsp; can bide their time&nbsp; (Westlake, International Law, Part II, War, 2d ed., pp. 121-123).</p> <p>Though the fact of occupation imposes no duties upon the inhabitants of the occupied territory, the invader himself is not left equally free.&nbsp; As it is a consequence of his acts that the regular government of the country is&nbsp; suspended, he is bound to take whatever means are required for the security of public order; and as his presence, so long as it&nbsp; is based upon occupation, is confessedly temporary, and his rights of control spring only from the necessity of the case, he is also bound to alter or override the existing laws&nbsp; as little as&nbsp; possible&nbsp; (Hall, International&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; 6th ed., p. 476).</p> <p>The government established here under the&nbsp; Philippine Executive Commission&nbsp; was more in consonance with&nbsp; the general practice&nbsp; among civilized nations, in establishing governments for&nbsp; the maintenance of peace and order and the administration of justice, in territories&nbsp; of the enemy under military occupation; because said&nbsp; government&nbsp; was of a temporary character. The government subsequently&nbsp; established&nbsp; under the so- called&nbsp; Philippine Republic,&nbsp; with a new constitution,&nbsp; was also of the nature of a<em> de facto</em> government,&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; International Law, as&nbsp; it was&nbsp; established&nbsp; under&nbsp; the authority of the&nbsp; military occupant and supported by&nbsp; the armed forces of the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was&nbsp; somewhat different from that established under the Philippine Executive Commission,&nbsp; because the former apparently, at least, had&nbsp; the semblance of permanency, which, however,&nbsp; is unusual&nbsp; in the practices among&nbsp; civilized nations,&nbsp; under similar&nbsp; circumstances.</p> <p>Under military occupation, the original national character of the soil and of the inhabitants of the territory remains unaltered; and although the invader is invested with quasi-sovereignity, which gives him a claim as of right to&nbsp; the obedience of the&nbsp; conquered population,&nbsp; nevertheless,&nbsp; its exercise is limited by the qualification which has&nbsp; gradually become established, that he must&nbsp; not, as a general rule, modify the permanent institutions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; country (Hall, International Law, 6th ed., p. 460).</p> <p>The Convention Concerning: the Laws and&nbsp; Customs of War&nbsp; on Land,&nbsp; adopted at The Hague in 1899, lays down (Arts. 42, 43)&nbsp; definite rules concerning military authority over the territory of a hostile state.&nbsp; In addition to codifying the accepted law, it provides that the&nbsp; occupant must respect, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.</p> <p>It will&nbsp; thus&nbsp; be readily seen that the municipal law of the invaded state continues&nbsp; in force, in so far as it does not affect the hostile occupant unfavorably.&nbsp; The regular courts of the occupied territory continue to act in&nbsp; cases not affecting the&nbsp; military occupation;&nbsp; and it is not customary for the invader&nbsp; to take the whole&nbsp; administration into his own hands, as it is easier to preserve order through the agency of&nbsp; the native officials,&nbsp; and also because the latter are more competent to administer the laws of the territory; and&nbsp; the military occupant, therefore, generally keeps in&nbsp; their&nbsp; posts such of the&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; officers as are willing to serve under him, subjecting them only to supervision by&nbsp; the&nbsp; military&nbsp; authorities, or&nbsp; by superior civil authorities appointed by him (Young <em>vs.</em> United States, 97 U.

S., 388; 18 Sup.&nbsp; Ct., 890; 43 Law. ed., 208.)</p> <p>Under the proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur, dated October 23, 1944, declaring null and void all laws, regulations and&nbsp; processes issued&nbsp; and promulgated by the Philippine&nbsp; Executive Commission and the Philippine Republic, during Japanese occupation, said&nbsp; Ordinance No. 7 promulgated on March&nbsp; 8, 1944, creating the Court of Special&nbsp; and Exclusive&nbsp; Criminal Jurisdiction,&nbsp; ostensibly for the speedy reestablishment of peace and&nbsp; order, and Executive Order No. 157 of the&nbsp; Chairman of&nbsp; the Executive Commission, prescribing summary rules of procedure, and other allied laws, such as Act No. 65 of the puppet republic, prescribing&nbsp; heavier&nbsp; penalties, became&nbsp; null and void, once the Japanese armies in the Philippines had been defeated, as with them the <em>de facto</em> governments, successively established under them, perished, and with them all their enactments and processes of a hostile character.</p> <p>But there are other considerations equally important why judicial proceedings held and conducted before the&nbsp; courts established by said <em>de facto</em> governments, under laws promulgated by them, should be declared null and void, without violating, in the least, settled&nbsp; principles, judicial precedents or public policy.</p> <p>Said Ordinance No. 7 adopted as integral parts thereof said Executive Order No. 157, as well as said Act No. 65 of the National Assembly of the puppet republic, prescribing exceptionally heavy&nbsp; penalties for the crimes enumerated therein.</p> <p>The principal crimes&nbsp; mentioned in said&nbsp; Ordinance No. 7 and Act No. 65 of the puppet republic and the other allied laws&nbsp; are illegal possession of firearms, robbery, violations of food-control laws, falsification, malversation and bribery ; and it was under said laws that herein petitioner was prosecuted&nbsp; and sentenced&nbsp; to life&nbsp; imprisonment&nbsp; for the crime of robbery.</p> <p>The penalty&nbsp; of life imprisonment or death for robbery was aimed principally&nbsp; at the underground forces&nbsp; resolute and determined to&nbsp; seize and remove&nbsp; stores of food provisions,&nbsp; whenever possible, to prevent them from falling into the hands&nbsp; of the enemy.</p> <p>The penalty&nbsp; of&nbsp; twelve years'&nbsp; imprisonment&nbsp; for&nbsp; illegal possession of firearms was directed mainly against those underground forces, that had been receiving arms from the forces of liberation across the seas.</p> <p>Violations of food-control&nbsp; laws were included&nbsp; and used as a pretext and&nbsp; justification for&nbsp; the seizure and confiscation of food provisions so&nbsp; badly needed by the invader.</p> <p>And the&nbsp; inclusion under said Ordinance&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 7 of the crime of bribery and other was used as a cloak to conceal its venom and make said law look innocent.</p> <p>By the imposition of excessive penalties,&nbsp; by the denial of the remedy of habeas corpus, by compelling the accused to testify against themselves, and by&nbsp; denying them the right of appeal&nbsp; to the highest court of&nbsp; the land, except where the death penatly was imposed, and by its&nbsp; summary procedure, said Ordinance No. 7 and the&nbsp; other allied laws impaired and defeated&nbsp; the just and legal rights of Filipino citizens under the Commonwealth Constitution,&nbsp; and the supremacy of the&nbsp; authority of the legitimate Government; Under said&nbsp; laws,&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons accused were deprived&nbsp; of liberty without due process of law.</p> <p>In the language of this&nbsp; Court, "the phrase 'due process of law'&nbsp; used in&nbsp; the Philippine Bill should receive a&nbsp; comprehensive&nbsp; interpretation, and no&nbsp; procedure should&nbsp; be treated as unconstitutional which makes due provision for the trial of alleged criminal before a court of competent jurisdiction, for bringing the accused into court and&nbsp; notifying him of the cause he is required to&nbsp; meet, for giving nim&nbsp; an opportunity to be&nbsp; heard, for the&nbsp; deliberation and judgment of the court, and for an appeal from such judgment to the&nbsp; highest tribunal"&nbsp; (United States <em>vs.</em> Kennedy,. 18 Phil., 122).</p> <p>In their conception,&nbsp; in their purpose&nbsp; and mode of enforcement and execution said&nbsp; laws were hostile to the authority of the Commonwealth Government and that of the United States of America; as they had been&nbsp; promulgated in furtherance of the war aims of the enemy, and&nbsp; they are, therefore, of political character and&nbsp; complexion.</p> <p>Those repressive laws were aimed at the men and women who had kept the faith, and whose heroes and martyrs now lie in graves still unknown and whose names remain unsung; but whose heroic efforts and sacrifices have made immortal the legends of Filipino resistance, and made possible our participation in the councils of free and liberty-loving peoples and nations.</p> <p>Said laws are contrary to the principles of Democracy, championed by North America, whose gigantic efforts and heroic sacrifices have vindicated human rights, human dignity and human freedom, and consecrated them anew all over the earth with the generous blood of her children. They violate the fundamental principles of Justice for which civilized Mankind stands, under the benign leadership of Totalitarianism and given all the nations of the earth a new birth as well as a new charter of freedom, to enable each and everyone to live a nobler and more worthy life and realize the justice and prosperity of the future.</p> <p>For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the dispositive part of the opinion prepared by Mr. Justice Feria.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p> <p><strong>PERFECTO, J.,</strong></p> <p>On October 21, 1944, petitioner William F. Peralta began to serve, in the Muntinglupa Prison Camp, a sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction, created by Ordinance No. 7 issued by President Laurel of the Republic of the Philippines under the Japanese regime, and now seeks a writ of habeas corpus in order that his liberty may be restored to him, contending that said Ordinance No. 7 was null and void <em>ab intio</em> because it was of a political complexion and its provisions are violative of the fundamental laws of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.</p> <p>Petitioner alleges that sometime in the month of September, 1943, he joined the Constabulary forces as a private, against his will, and, before joining it, he was for several times arrested and maltreated as a <em>guerrilla</em> member, he being then a minor only 17 years old, and that he was prosecuted, not because he committed any crime, but because he joined the <em>guerrilla</em> organization, deserted the Constabulary forces, and followed political and military activities in open allegiance to the Commonwealth Government and the United States of America.</p> <p>The Solicitor General, appearing in behalf of respondent Director of Prisons, answered the petition agreeing that the acts and proceedings taken and had before said Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction should be denied force and efficacy, and therefore, recommended that the writ prayed for be granted.</p> <p>At the hearing held on September 21, and 22, 1945, there appeared to argue the First Assistant Solicitor General, impugning the validity of said Ordinance No. 7, and the City Fiscal of Manila, as <em>amicus curiae</em>, who sustained the validity of the said Ordinance and the proceeding by virtue of which petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p> <p align="center">I. ORDINANCE NO. 7 AND PROCESSES UNDER IT NULLIFIED BY <br> THE OCTOBER PROCLAMATION OF GENERAL MACARTHUR</p> <p>On October 23, 1944, General of the Army Douglas Mac-Arthur, Commander in Chief of the Philippine-American Forces, which fought in Bataan and later liberated the whole Philippines, as an aftermath of the liberation, issued a proclamation declaring:</p> <blockquote> <p>"1. That the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines is, subject to the supreme authority of the Government of the United States, the sole and only government having legal and valid jurisdiction over the people in areas of the Philippines free of enemy occupation and control;</p> <p>"2. That the laws now existing: on the statute books of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto are in full force and effect and legally binding upon the people in areas of the Philippines free of enemy occupation and control; and</p> <p>"3. That all laws, regulations and processes of any other government in the Philippines than that of the said&nbsp; Commonwealth are null and void and without legal effect in areas of the Philippines&nbsp; of enemy occupation and control."</p> </blockquote> <p>It appears that Ordinance No. 7 in question has been issued under the Japanese regime and that the judicial process under which petitioner has been sentenced to life imprisonment, having been held in a court not belonging to the Commonwealth of the Philippines but organized and established under the authority of the enemy, became null and void and without effect since October 23, 1944, by virtue of the above-quoted October Proclamation of General MacArthur.</p> <p>We have explained at length our position as to the effects of said October Proclamation in our dissenting opinion in the case of Co Kim Cham<em> vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (G. R. No. L-5, 153, <em>ante</em>), and we deem it unnecessary to repeat what we stated in said opinion.</p> <p>It is fortunate that all the members of the Supreme Court arrived at a unanimous conclusion as to the absolute nullity of the process under which petitioner is now being held in prison.</p> <p>The shocking character of the provisions of Ordinance No. 7 and the processes held under it show once more how General MacArthur was absolutely right and justified in issuing the October Proclamation.</p> <p>There are indications that more processes held under the Japanese regime will come to our knowledge, revealing strong grounds for their annulment, justifying, like the process here in question, the wisdom of the decision of General McArthur in nullifying in a sweeping manner all judicial processes held during enemy occupation.</p> <p>The October Proclamation is, besides, in keeping with the following official statement of the President of the United States:</p> <blockquote> <p>"On the fourteenth of this month, a puppet government was set up in the Philippine Islands with Jose P. Laurel, formerly a justice of the Philippine Supreme Court as president.' Jorge Vargas, formerly a member of the Philippine Commonwealth Cabinet and Benigno Aquino, also formerly a member of that cabinet, were closely associated with Laurel in this movement. The first act of the new puppet regime was to sign a military alliance with Japan. The second act was a hypocritical appeal for American sympathy which was made in fraud and deceit, and was designed to confuse and&nbsp;&nbsp; mislead&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp;&nbsp; people.</p> <p>"I wish to make it clear that neither the former collaborationist 'Philippine Executive Commission' nor the present 'Philippine Republic has the recognition or sympathy of the Government of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p> <p>"Our sympathy goes out to those who remain loyal to the United States and the Commonwealth—that great majority of the Filipino people who have not been deceived by the promises of ihe enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ?</p> <p>"October 23, 1943.</p> <p align="right">"FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT<br> <em>"President of the United States"</em></p> <p>(From U. S. Naval War College, International Law Documents, 1943, pp. 93, 94.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Putting aside the October Proclamation, by a mere perusal of the ordinance in question, we will see immediately how such law and the processes held under it are incompatible with the fundamental principles and essential safeguards in criminal procedure, universally recognized in civilized modern nations and how such ordinance and processes can only be justified by a retrogressive and reactionary mentality developed under the social, cultural, and political atmosphere of the era of darkness.</p> <p align="center">II. VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE AGAINST <br> UNREASONABLE&nbsp;&nbsp; SEARCHES&nbsp;&nbsp; AND&nbsp;&nbsp; SEIZURES</p> <p>Section 5 of Ordinance No. 7 provides that cases arising under it shall follow the summary procedure provided in Act No. 65 of the Laurel Philippine Republic, which, in turn, is the same as that established by Chapter II of Executive Order No. 157 of the Chairman of the Vargas Philippine Executive Commission, dated May 18, 1943.</p> <p>Under said procedure, "search warrants may be issued by the court or by any prosecuting officer, authorizing peace officers to search for and seize any articles or objects de-Scribed in the warrant, including those which may be regarded as evidence of an offense under this order even if such articles or objects are not included among those described in section 2, Rule 122, of the Rules of Court." This provision is repugnant to the Filipino sense of right in the matter of warrants of search and seizure, sense of right which has been clearly and definitely stereotyped in the following words of our fundamental law:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, to be determined by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." (Art. Ill, sec. 1, No. 3, Constitution of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Philippines.)</p> </blockquote> <p>This constitutional provision is violated by the summary, unreasonable, and arbitrary procedure provided under the authority of the ordinance in question:</p> <p>(1) By authorizing "any prosecuting officer" to issue search warrants, when under our Constitution such search warrants should be issued only by a judge;</p> <p>(2) By trespassing the limits established by section 2, Rule 122, of the Rules of Court, considered as a necessary element to make the warrant reasonable;</p> <p>(3) By authorizing the search and seizure of articles or&nbsp; objects not described&nbsp; in warrant,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; the real meaning of the words "including those which may be regarded as evidence of an offense under this Ordinance."</p> <p align="center">III.&nbsp; DISCRIMINATORY&nbsp;&nbsp; AND&nbsp;&nbsp; INIQUITOUS&nbsp;&nbsp; SUSPENSION&nbsp;&nbsp; OF&nbsp;&nbsp; THE <br> WRIT OF&nbsp;&nbsp; HABEAS&nbsp;&nbsp; CORPUS</p> <p>Section 7 of Ordinance No. 7 in question provides that "the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus are hereby suspended with respect to persons accused of, or under investigation for, any of the crimes and offenses enumerated in sections 1 and 2 hereof."</p> <p>This provision is also violative of one of the fundamental guarantees established in the Constitution of the Philippines, which provides that the writ of habeas corpus may be suspended only in case of "invasion, insurrection, or rebellion" and only "when the public safety requires it."</p> <blockquote> <p>"The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, when the public safety requires it, in any of which events the same may be suspended wherever during such period the necessity for such suspension shall exist." (Art. Ill, sec. 1, No. 14, Constitution of the Philippines.)</p> </blockquote> <p> Again, it is evident that the ordinance in question is repugnant to the deep sense of right of our people. It is so, not only because it suspends the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, without the circumstances which can only justify said suspension, but because it flagrantly violates the fundamental principle of equality before the law, by depriving the accused, in cases falling under the ordinance in question, of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, which is not denied to the accused in all other cases: "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied Jhe equal protection of the laws." (Art. Ill, sec. 1, No. 1, Constitution of the Philippines.)</p> <p align="center">IV. VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE AGAINST <br> SELF-INCRIMINATION</p> <p>Under section 18 of Executive Order No. 157, above mentioned, "the accused <em>or his representative</em> may be examined by the court, and with the permission of the court, by the fiscal or other prosecuting officer as to any matters favorable or unfavorable to him or his principal." (Italics ours.)</p> <p>It is also provided that "statements made by the accused, his <em>co-accused</em>, or the <em>representative</em> of the accused <em>or a person acting in a similar capacity, irrespective of the circumstances under which they toere made shall be </em>admissible in evidence if material to the issue."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics ours.)</p> <p>Under section 21 of Executive Order No. 157, after arraignment and plea,&nbsp; "the judge shall interrogate the accused * * * as to facts and circumstances of the case in order to clarify the points in dispute and those which are admitted."</p> <p>In the same section it is also provided that "refusal of the accused to answer any questions made or allowed by the court may be considered unfavorable to <em>him</em>." (italics ours.)</p> <p>Under the same section <em>the absence </em>of an accused or of his representative "shall not be a ground for interrupting the proceedings or attacking the validity of the judgment."</p> <p>From the foregoing, it appears:</p> <p>(1) That the accused may be examined by the court or any proaecuting officer as to any matters favorable or <em>un favorable to him</em>;</p> <p>(2) That the refusal of the accused to answer may be considered unfavorable to him;</p> <p>(3) That statements made by the accused, "irrespective of the circumstances under which they were made" (that is, even under third degree procedure, or exacted through brutal <em>kempei</em> tortures), shall be admissible in evidence;</p> <p>(4) That not only the accused, but "his representative" (his lawyer, whose personal security was jeopardized un der the Japanese regime), may be examined by the court or by the fiscal or other prosecuting officer, as if said representative or attorney is facing the same criminal prosecution instituted against his client;</p> <p>(5) That the statement made by said representative or attorney, although exacted under duress, intimidation, or torture, shall bo admissible in evidence;</p> <p>(6) That statements made by any person acting in a similar capacity as a representative of the accused which may be a relative or a friend or, perhaps, just a mere acquaintance, or even an impostor who might pose as a representative to assure the doom of the accused, "irrespective of the circumstances under which they were made (that is, even if made in the absence of the accused, or in&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; under&nbsp; which&nbsp; masked&nbsp; spies decreed the death of innocent citizens pointed by them during zoning concentrations), shall be admissible in evidence;</p> <p>(7) That trial shall proceed in the absence of the accused ;</p> <p>(8) That trial shall proceed in the absence of his at torney or other representative.</p> <p>It is evident that the procedure established violates the following provisions of our fundamental code:</p> <blockquote> <p>"In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall be presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to be heai'd by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to have a speedy and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses in his behalf." (Art. Ill, sec. 1, No. 17, Constitution of the Philippines.)</p> <p>"No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself." (Art.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill,&nbsp;&nbsp; sec.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; <em>Idem.</em>)</p> </blockquote> <p>The procedure is so revolving, so nauseating, and so opposed to human nature, that it takes a real courage to keep our equanimity while we are compelled to analyze it.</p> <p>It is beyond our comprehension how a man, endowed with reason, could devise such an execrable system of judicial procedure, which is but a shameless mockery of the administration of justice.</p> <p>We must be very careful to retain zealously the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination. We must not forget that that constitutional guarantee was acquired as a result of protest against all inquisitorial and third degree procedures. We must not forget how, not very long ago, in the thirteen colonies of America, alleged witches were burned at the stake, as a means of compelling them to confess their fantastic compacts with the devil. We must not forget how an institution created in the twelfth century was the cause of so much tortures and sufferings, and that the terroristic menace of its rakes was abolished in Spain, and therefore in Philippines, only in 1834.</p> <p>We must not forget that during normal times, under the twentieth century lights, just before the last global war started, in the United States of America and in the Philippines, denunciations of third degree procedures employed by agents of the law were often heard. This very Supreme Court, not only once, had to deal with cases where such tactics were conclusively proved. Even today, among criminal cases we have under consideration, there is evidence of confessions exacted through cruel and brutal means.</p> <p>No matter what merits can be found, from the theoretical point of view, in the arguments of those who are championing the suppression of the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination, the undeniable reality of human experience shows conclusively the absolute need of such guarantee if justice must be served. Even with the existence of such guarantee, there are officers of the law who cannot resist temptation of using their power to compel, through third degree methods, innocent or guilty persons to admit involuntarily real or imaginary offenses. Let us allow changes tending to nullify the protection against self-incrimination, and no man, however innocent he may be, shall be secure in his person, in his liberty, in his honor, in his life.</p> <p align="center">V. THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OP APPEAL TRAMPLED UPON</p> <p>In section 6 of Ordinance No. 7, it is provided that "the decision of the special courts herein created shall be final except where the penalty imposed is death, in which case the records of the particular case shall be elevated <em>en consulta</em> to a special division of the Supreme Court composed of three members to be designated by the President of the Republic of the Philippines."</p> <p>This provision is a clear violation of the fundamental right of appeal, constitutionally guaranteed to all accused in the Philippines.</p> <p>Under the Constitution of the Philippines, all accused are entitled to appeal to the Supreme Court:</p> <p>(1) In all cases in which the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, law, ordinance, or executive order or regulations is in question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art.

VIII, sec. 2, No. 5, <em>Idem</em>.)</p> <p>Before the adoption of the Constitution of the Philippines, it was the prevailing theory in judicial decisions that the right of appeal is not a fundamental one, but it is a mere privilege or mere statutory grant.</p> <p>The drafters of our Constitution, taught by the unerring lessons of human experience, came to the conclusion that mistake is one of the most irretrievable human weaknesses.</p> <p>The drafters of our Constitution, therefore, considered it necessary to establish constitutional guarantees to reduce to its minimum the effects of such innate human weakness by providing that appeal to the highest tribunal of the land may be enjoyed by any accused, who, under the specific provisions of the Constitution, believed himself to be the victim of a wrong in any inferior court.</p> <p>The fact that the provisions of section 2, of Article VIII, of the Constitution, instead of stating that the accused shall not be denied of the right of appeal in the cases mentioned therein, provide that the Supreme Court may not be deprived of its jurisdiction to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal, certiorari, or writ of error as the law or the rules of court may provide, final judgments and decrees of inferior courts,&nbsp; in the specified cases, does not impair nor diminish the fundamental character of the right of appeal of the accused to the Supreme Court.</p> <p>The provisions of section 2, of Article VIII, of the&nbsp; Constitution, have been enacted by our Constitutional Convention, not for the benefit of the Supreme Court, but for the benefit and well-being of the&nbsp; people.</p> <p>In fact,&nbsp; the Supreme Court is&nbsp; just one of the instrumentalities created by the&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; in the service of the&nbsp; people.&nbsp; The Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; is not an entity or institution whose rights and privileges must&nbsp; be constitutionally guaranteed.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is only&nbsp; a means.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one of the means considered necessary by our Constitution to better serve the supreme&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of the&nbsp; people.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, the Supreme&nbsp; Court of the United States itself declared that the elimination of said tribunal is not incompatible&nbsp; with the existence of a government of laws.&nbsp; In&nbsp; a case&nbsp; of denaturalization wherein the Government of the United States&nbsp; sought to&nbsp; deprive a person of his&nbsp; American citizenship,&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; 1928 platform of the Communist Party&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; States, to which the&nbsp; respondent belonged, advocated the abolition of the&nbsp; Supreme Court, of the&nbsp; Senate and of&nbsp; the veto power of the&nbsp; President, and replacement of&nbsp; congressional&nbsp; districts with "councils of workers" in which legislative and executive powers would&nbsp; be united, the Federal Supreme Court declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>"These&nbsp; would&nbsp; indeed be significant changes in&nbsp; our governmental structure—changes which it is safe to&nbsp; say&nbsp; are not desired by the majority of&nbsp; the&nbsp; people in this&nbsp; country—but whatever our personal views, as&nbsp; judges we cannot say that person who advocates&nbsp; their adoption through peaceful and constitutional means is not in fact attached to the Constitution—those institutions are not enumerated as necessary in the government's test of 'general political philosophy', and it is conceivable that 'orderly liberty' could be maintained without them.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Senate has not gone&nbsp; free of criticism and&nbsp; one object of the Seventeenth Amendment was to make it more responsive to the popular&nbsp; will.&nbsp; The unicameral&nbsp; legislature is not unknown&nbsp; in the country.&nbsp; It is true that this Court has played a large part in the unfolding of the&nbsp; constitutional plan (sometimes too much so&nbsp; m the opinion of&nbsp; some&nbsp; observers), but we&nbsp; would be&nbsp; arrogant indeed if we presume&nbsp; that a government of laws, with&nbsp; protection for minority groups, would be impossible without it. Like other agencies of government, this Court at various&nbsp; lines in its existence has&nbsp; not escaped the shafts of critics whose sincerity and attachment to&nbsp; the Constitution is&nbsp; beyond question—critics who have accused it of&nbsp; assuming functions of judicial review not intended to be conferred upon it, or of abusing those functions to thwart the popular will, and who have advocated&nbsp; various remedies taking a wide range."&nbsp; (Schneiderman vs. United States of America, June 21, 1943.)</p> </blockquote> <p align="center">VI. ABRIDGMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE OF <br> EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS</p> <p>The constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws is evidently&nbsp; abridged in the summary procedure&nbsp; in criminal cases under&nbsp; Ordinance No. 7:</p> <p>(1)&nbsp; By&nbsp; the fact that the accused therein&nbsp; are victims of search warrants specially provided for them, where the guarantees against unreasonableness in search warrants issued against other accused are specially eliminated.</p> <p>(2)&nbsp; By depriving the accused, under Ordinance No.&nbsp; 7, the privilege&nbsp; of the writ of habeas corpus enjoyed by the accused in other cases.</p> <p>(3)&nbsp; By&nbsp; depriving the accused, under Ordinance No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 7, of the fundamental right&nbsp; of&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; in all&nbsp; cases, except when sentence&nbsp; of&nbsp; death is&nbsp; imposed.</p> <p>(4)&nbsp; By&nbsp; discriminating against the&nbsp; accused, under Ordinance No. 7,&nbsp; where the&nbsp; right of&nbsp; appeal is retained for them, that is, in cases where the sentence imposed is death, by entrusting the power to revise said sentence to a small minority&nbsp; of the Supreme&nbsp; Court, under the Japanese regime, and a minority of three justices to be specially called out by the President&nbsp; of the Laurel&nbsp; Philippine Republic, undoubtedly with the evident purpose of assuring&nbsp; the confirmation of the conviction of the&nbsp; accused, and&nbsp; to make the appeal <em>en consulta</em> just an empty gesture&nbsp; to make the situation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused more&nbsp; pitiful by lengthening his days of agony.</p> <p>(5)&nbsp; By placing the accused,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the cases in question, under the sword of Damocles of an unfavorable presumption, should he refuse to answer any question that the court or any prosecuting officer might propound to him.</p> <p>Under our Constitution, no one shall be deprived of the "equal protection of the laws."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. Ill, sec. 1, No. 1, Constitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines.)</p> <p align="center">VII. THE PRESUMPTION&nbsp; OF INNOCENCE OF&nbsp; THE ACCUSED IN <br> ALL CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS VIOLATED</p> <p>Since the American&nbsp; flag began to fly over our soil, the fundamental&nbsp; guarantee that in all criminal prosecution the accused shall be presumed innocent until the&nbsp; contrary is proved&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; all reasonable doubt, has been implanted in our country to remain forever.</p> <p>That guarantee was&nbsp; consecrated in our Constitution:</p> <blockquote> <p>"In&nbsp; all&nbsp; criminal prosecutions the accused shall be&nbsp; presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the&nbsp; right to be heard by himself and&nbsp; counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accusation against&nbsp; him, to have&nbsp; a speedy and public trial, to meet the&nbsp; witnesses face to face, and&nbsp; to have compulsory process to&nbsp; secure the attendance of witnesses in his behalf." (Art. Ill, sec.&nbsp; 1, No. 17, Constitution of the Philippines.)</p> </blockquote> <p>This guarantee is undoubtedly violated when, in the summary procedure established by&nbsp; Ordinance No. 7,&nbsp; it is provided&nbsp; that the refusal of the accused to&nbsp; answer any question,&nbsp; propounded&nbsp;&nbsp; by the court&nbsp; or&nbsp; any prosecuting officer, "may raise unfavorable presumption against him."</p> <p>If we have to keep&nbsp; democracy&nbsp; in our countryt we must be vigilant in upholding the constitutional principle&nbsp; that all persons shall be presumed to be&nbsp; innocent until the&nbsp; contrary is proved&nbsp; beyond ail reasonable doubt.</p> <p>This principle is&nbsp; the opposite of that prevailing under autocracies, or under facist or totalitarian regimes.&nbsp; During the Japanese occupation, all persons&nbsp; who&nbsp; might fall under the suspicion of any Japanese or&nbsp; their spies and lackeys, were presumed to be guilty of any imaginary crime until they were able to&nbsp; convince their victimizers of the contrary, beyond any&nbsp; reasonable doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even then, they were submitted to&nbsp; preventive tortures&nbsp; and long months of imprisonment, just in case they might&nbsp; think&nbsp; later of committing&nbsp; any&nbsp; offense&nbsp; against the Japanese&nbsp; or their collaborators.</p> <p align="center">VIII. ORDINANCE NO.&nbsp; 7 VIOLATED THE HAGUE<br> CONVENTION OP 1899</p> <p>In the convention concerning the laws and customs of war on land, adopted by&nbsp; the Hague in 1899, it is provided that the military occupant must respect the laws in force in the occupied&nbsp; country,&nbsp; unless&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely&nbsp; prevented. (Arts.&nbsp; 42 and 43.)</p> <p>This provision of the Convention has been flagrantly violated when,&nbsp; under the enemy&nbsp; occupation, the Laurel Philippine&nbsp; Republic enacted Ordinance No. 7 which suspended our laws, including the fundamental one, by substantially subverting the judicial procedures in the special criminal cases instituted under said&nbsp; ordinance.</p> <p>For&nbsp; this reason, said ordinance, being violative of international law, was null and void <em>ab initio</em>.</p> <p>Under international law, under the most elemental principles&nbsp; of law,&nbsp; the&nbsp; legitimate government,&nbsp; once restored to its&nbsp; own territory, after&nbsp; expelling the enemy invader, enjoys&nbsp; the absolute freedom of not recognizing or of nullifying any and all acts of the invader, including&nbsp; those internationally legal ones.&nbsp; The&nbsp; situation is exactly the same as that of the&nbsp; owner of&nbsp; a house who can do anything in it that&nbsp; pleases him, after&nbsp; expelling the bandit who was able to usurp its possession for&nbsp; a&nbsp; while.</p> <p>General MacArthur exercised&nbsp; correctly that power by the&nbsp; sweeping&nbsp; nullification&nbsp; decreed&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; October Proclamation.</p> <p>But even without the October Proclamation, the judicial process—maybe it&nbsp; is&nbsp; better&nbsp; to&nbsp; say injudicial&nbsp; process— which resulted in the imprisonment of petitioner, must be shorn of all effects because it had taken place under the authority of an ordinance&nbsp; which&nbsp; was null and void <em>ab initio</em>.</p> <p align="center">IX. THE DECISION CONVICTING THE PETITIONER HAVING BEEN<br> RENDERED UNDER FOREIGN AUTHORITY IS&nbsp; UNENFORCEABLE</p> <p>The decision by which petitioner&nbsp; William F. Peralta was convicted and is being confined&nbsp; for life having&nbsp; been rendered by a tribunal created, functioning, and acting under the authority of a foreign State, the Emperor of the Imperial Government of Japan, is unenforceable.</p> <p>It has, therefore, the nature of a foreign&nbsp; decision or judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that reason, it is unenforceable within the Philippines or under the Commonwealth, as we have shown in our opinion in the case of Co Kim&nbsp; Cham <em>vs. </em>Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon&nbsp; (G. R. No. L-5, p. 153, <em>ante</em>).</p> <p>Said&nbsp; decision, having been rendered under&nbsp; Ordinance No. 7, which was null and void <em>ab&nbsp; initio</em>, carries the same vice as the ordinance under which it was rendered.</p> <p>But even admitting <em>arguendo</em> that said decision is valid, because it is so under international law, and is not included in the nullification decreed by General Douglas MacArthur, still it cannot be enforced, being&nbsp; a&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; A foreign decision can only be enforced through the institution of an action&nbsp; before&nbsp; our tribunals.&nbsp; Even decisions of a court of the&nbsp; United States or of&nbsp; any of its&nbsp; States or territories can be enforced in the Philippines only by the institution of an&nbsp; action&nbsp; or&nbsp; special proceeding before our own courts.&nbsp; This theory is confirmed by sections 47 and 48, Rule 39, of the Rules of Court, which read:</p> <blockquote> <p>"SEC. 47. <em>Effect of record of a court of&nbsp; the United States.</em>—The effect of a judicial record&nbsp; of a court of the United States or of&nbsp; a court&nbsp; of one&nbsp; of the States or territories of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States, is the same in the Philippines as in the&nbsp; United States, or in the State or territory where it was made,&nbsp; except that it can only be enforced here by an action or special proceeding, and except, also, that the authority of&nbsp; a&nbsp; guardian,&nbsp; or executor,&nbsp; or administrator does not extend beyond the jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Government under which he was invested with his authority.</p> <p>"SEC. 48. <em>Effect of foreign judgments.</em>—The effect of a judgment of a tribunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment, is as follows:</p> <p>"(a) In case of a judgment against a specific thing,&nbsp; the judgment is conclusive upon the title to the thing;</p> <p>"(b) In case of a judgment against a person, the judgment is presumptive evidence of a right as&nbsp; between the parties&nbsp; and&nbsp; their successors in interest by a subsequent&nbsp; title; but the judgment may be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction,, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud,&nbsp; or clear mistake of law or fact."</p> </blockquote> <p align="center">X. THE&nbsp; STUNNTNG&nbsp; FACTS REVEALED IN THE REPORT OF&nbsp; THE<br> DIRECTOR OF PRISONS</p> <p>At the hearing of this case, respondent Director of Prisons was required to&nbsp; submit statistical data concerning the number of prisoners&nbsp; and the various&nbsp; crimes for which they were&nbsp; convicted by the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction.</p> <p>In submitting&nbsp; said&nbsp; statistical&nbsp; data, the&nbsp; Solicitor General, as counsel for respondent, calls&nbsp; our attention to the fact that, out of the&nbsp; 92 prisoners&nbsp; committed by said courts to the&nbsp; Bureau of Prisons&nbsp; for confinement, fifty-five (55), that is&nbsp; more than one-half, were convicted of&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; firearms,&nbsp; and that only 3&nbsp; are now&nbsp; actually in confinement serving&nbsp; sentences, among them the petitioner in this&nbsp; proceeding,&nbsp; thus dissipating&nbsp; the unfounded&nbsp; fear entertained by the City Fiscal of&nbsp; Manila, to the effect&nbsp; that a pronouncement by this Supreme Tribunal that the&nbsp; sentences&nbsp; of the courts&nbsp; in question are null and void,&nbsp; will signify&nbsp; the release of hundreds of criminals, whose liberty and mixing with society will endanger&nbsp; public peace&nbsp; and order.</p> <p>Of the other&nbsp; two remaining prisoners serving sentence, one has been committed for evasion of service of sentence, and the other for illegal possession of firearms.</p> <p>Of the&nbsp; 55 prisoners convicted&nbsp; for&nbsp; illegal possession of firearms, 25 died, 23 were released, and 6 escaped, and this is the reason why only one remains in confinement.</p> <p>It is striking that so many prisoners died, 25 of those convicted for illegal possession of firearms,&nbsp; that is, almost 50% of them, and 33 of the total of 94 prisoners committed, or more than one-third of them.&nbsp; This unusual and shocking percentage of mortality is&nbsp; worth inquiring into and, certainly, cannot be counted very favorably to judicial proceedings which eventually lead&nbsp; to&nbsp; such wholesale death, if not outright massacre.</p> <p>The fact that a big number of the prisoners, 21 of them, were able to escape, was not explained to us.&nbsp; Is it reasonable to surmise, from the&nbsp; ruthless cruelty of the proceedings and of the penalties imposed, which exacted from the mouth of&nbsp; the First Assistant Solicitor General, who appeared to argue the case in behalf&nbsp; of the respondent, the adjective "ferocious", that the wardens&nbsp; themselves, moved by pity, directly or indirectly helped the escape?</p> <p>More than one-third of&nbsp; the prisoners committed&nbsp; by the said courts in confinement to the Bureau of Prisons, that is, 33 of them died.&nbsp; May we ask if they died because they were&nbsp; executed?&nbsp; Of&nbsp; those who&nbsp; died, one&nbsp; was convicted of profiteering in rice, one of robbery, one of kidnapping of minor,&nbsp; one&nbsp; of violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; certain sections&nbsp; of Act No. 66, four of&nbsp; crimes against public&nbsp; order,&nbsp; and 25&nbsp; of possession&nbsp; of firearms.&nbsp; If all of them&nbsp; were executed by virtue&nbsp; of sentences rendered by the courts in question, that fact does not speak very highly of&nbsp; their proceedings. If the accused died by natural death, there must be something physically or morally&nbsp; fatal in said proceedings.</p> <p>If a tree must be judged by&nbsp; the fruits&nbsp; it bears,&nbsp; how shall we judge proceedings so deadly, so&nbsp; fatal, so wantonly inhuman as the proceedings had in the&nbsp; special courts&nbsp; in question ?</p> <p>The City Fiscal of Manila exerted great efforts to show that the fact that in the proceedings&nbsp; in question "the refusal of the accused to answer any question made or allowed by the court may&nbsp; be considered unfavorable to&nbsp; him,"&nbsp; does not violate&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitutional&nbsp;&nbsp; guarantee&nbsp; against&nbsp; self- incrimination.&nbsp; He&nbsp; even goes to the extent of maintaining the theory that such constitutional&nbsp; guarantee is not essential&nbsp; for&nbsp; the protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; the substantial rights of&nbsp; an accused.</p> <p>His argument centered on the alleged freedom of the accused to refuse or not to refuse to answer any question made or allowed by the court,&nbsp; alleging that, if the accused chooses to refuse to&nbsp; answer, the court cannot compel him to answer under menace of punishment for contempt or&nbsp; through any other coercive or minatory measures.</p> <p>The&nbsp; City Fiscal&nbsp; seems to labor under the belief that the fact that the silence of the accused "may be considered unfavorable to him", is&nbsp; of no consequence at all.</p> <p>Such belief can logically be entertained alone by ignoring completely the lessons&nbsp; of experience&nbsp; in human conduct.</p> <p>If the refusal to&nbsp; answer can&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered unfavorably to the accused, is not that the same as placing him on the hard predicament&nbsp; of choosing between&nbsp; testifying&nbsp; self- incriminatingly&nbsp; and risking the fatal effects of a&nbsp; legal presumption of guilt?&nbsp; Is not that the&nbsp; same as placing him between the two&nbsp; steel cages of a dilemma: self-incrimination or presumption&nbsp; of guilt?&nbsp; Is not that the same&nbsp; as placing him between Scylla and Charybdis, between a dagger&nbsp; and a wall?&nbsp; Either way, he will&nbsp; always find himself under the inexorable sword of&nbsp; Damocles of sure punishment, whether he testifies or refuses to testify.</p> <p>It is not&nbsp; impossible to open&nbsp; a debate upon&nbsp; the abstract question whether the constitutional guarantee&nbsp; against self- incrimination should or should not&nbsp; remain.&nbsp; But the value of such a moot question, for purposes of this&nbsp; case, is nil.</p> <p>The&nbsp; constitutional guarantee had to be adopted as a protest against inquisitorial method of the past, when accused and&nbsp; suspects&nbsp; were&nbsp; submitted to the&nbsp; most brutal torture to compel them to confess real or imaginary crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; That past is not&nbsp; far away.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that we are still smelling the stench of human flesh burned in the stakes, where suspected witches suffered&nbsp; iniquitous death.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the procedure in question shows the purpose of pandering to the most&nbsp; flagitious doctrines in criminal proceedings.&nbsp; The transgressions of the bill of rights in all its phases cannot be hidden even to a chela in constitutional law.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the&nbsp; very negation of the administration&nbsp; of&nbsp; justice.&nbsp; Such procedure has absolutely no place in the framework of our juridical&nbsp; system.&nbsp; We will feel mere whifflers in our professed convictions, principles, and creed, if we should permit ourselves to fall into the weakness of abetting it even for a moment,&nbsp; which could only happen once the&nbsp; flambeau of reason has ceased completely to burn.&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; one but the truckling lackeys of the arrogant enemy could have the servility of applauding the implantation of the criminal&nbsp; procedure in question.</p> <p>All arguments and dissertations are useless to conceal the real&nbsp; fact.&nbsp; Behind and under said criminal process steal-thily crawls and trundles the Nippon psychosis, like a cobra with fangs overflowing with venom.&nbsp;&nbsp; To ferret it out from the hole where it lurks, waiting for its&nbsp; victims, and crush its head with one hammer blow,&nbsp; is an imperative&nbsp; measure of national self-defense.</p> <p align="center">XI. THE PETITIONER IS ENTITLED, AS A MATTER&nbsp; OF ABSOLUTE<br> RIGHT, TO IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p> <p>After showing the absolute nullity&nbsp; of the judicial process under which petitioner has been convicted&nbsp; to suffer the penalty of life&nbsp; imprisonment,&nbsp; the inevitable&nbsp; consequence is that he is&nbsp; entitled, as a matter of&nbsp; absolute right,&nbsp; to be immediately released, so that he can&nbsp; once again enjoy a life of freedom, which is&nbsp; the natural boon to law-abiding residents of our country, and&nbsp; of which he was unjustly deprived&nbsp; through&nbsp; means&nbsp; most&nbsp; abhorrent&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; human conscience.</p> <p>We must not&nbsp; hesitate for one moment to&nbsp; do our duty in this&nbsp; case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sooner we comply with it, the better. The process and judgment under which petitioner has been convicted and is now undergoing an unjust imprisonment, is one of the&nbsp; hateful vestiges left in our country by the moral savagery of a people spiritually&nbsp; perverted and debased.&nbsp; The seriousness&nbsp; of this matter cannot be viewed with insouciance.</p> <p>We must not lose time to wipe out such vestiges&nbsp; if we must protect ourselves against their&nbsp; poisonous&nbsp; effects in our&nbsp; political,&nbsp; social, and cultural patrimony.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; must erase those vestiges if we want to keep immune from all germs of decay the democratic institutions which are the pride of our people and&nbsp; country, under which we are enjoying the blessings of freedom and with which we hope to assure&nbsp; the well-being and&nbsp; happiness&nbsp; of&nbsp; the unending generations who will succeed&nbsp; us in the enjoyment of the treasures accumulated by a bountiful&nbsp; nature in this Pearl of the Orient.</p> <p>If we allow such&nbsp; vestiges to remain we are afraid that some historian&nbsp; may write about Philippine democracy, Philippine race, and Philippine culture, what,&nbsp; on ancient art,&nbsp; Hegel said in the "Phenomenology&nbsp; of the Spirit", according to&nbsp; Kohler, the greatest work of genius that the nineteenth&nbsp; century has produced:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The statues set up&nbsp; are corpses in stone, whence the animating soul&nbsp; has flown;&nbsp; while the hymns&nbsp; of praise are words from which all belief has gone.&nbsp; The tables of the gods are bereft&nbsp; of spiritual food&nbsp; and drink, and from his games and festivals, man no more receives the joyful sense of&nbsp; his unity with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Divine Being.&nbsp; The works of the muse lack the force and energy of the Spirit which derived the certainty and assurance of itself just from the crushing ruin&nbsp; of goods and men.&nbsp; They are themselves now just what they are for us—beautiful fruit broken off&nbsp; the tree, a&nbsp; kindly fate has passed on those works to us, as&nbsp; a maiden might&nbsp; offer&nbsp; such fruit off a tree.&nbsp; It is not their actual&nbsp; life as they&nbsp; exist, that is given us, not the tree&nbsp; that bore them,&nbsp; not the earth and the elements, which constituted their substance,&nbsp; nor the climate&nbsp; that determined their constitutive character,&nbsp; nor the change of&nbsp; seasons which con- trolled the process of their growth. So, too,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; not their living world that fate preserves and gives us with those works of ancient art, not the spring and summer of that ethical life in which they bloomed&nbsp; and&nbsp; ripened, but the&nbsp; veiled remembrance alone of this reality."</p> </blockquote> <p>Our sense of national&nbsp; self-preservation compels us, as an&nbsp; imperative&nbsp; duty,&nbsp; not&nbsp; only to restore immediately the petitioner to his personal liberty; but,&nbsp; all possible means, to obliterate even the memory of the inquisitorial summary procedure depicted in the present case.</p> <p>Such procedure&nbsp; exhibits&nbsp; either inversion, retroversion, subversion,&nbsp; or perversion&nbsp; of elemental human concepts.&nbsp; It ignores completely and&nbsp; debases the high&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; of a judicial procedure.&nbsp; It represents a hylistic ideology which proclaims the supremacy of the state force over fundamental&nbsp; human rights.&nbsp; We must&nbsp; never allow the neck of our people to be haltered by the lethal string of that ideology. It is&nbsp; a&nbsp; virus that&nbsp; must be eliminated&nbsp; before&nbsp; it produces the logical&nbsp; disaster.&nbsp; Such ideology is&nbsp; a cancerous excrescence that must be sheared, completely extirpated, from the live tissues of our body politic,&nbsp; if the same must be saved.</p> <p>We cannot understand how&nbsp; any one can justify the summary process in question&nbsp; under the principles embodied in our Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; To profess attachment to those principies and, at the same time, to accept and justify such kind of criminal&nbsp; miscarriage of justice, is just sheer hypocrisy. It is a repetition of what Seneca did when, after preaching moral virtue's,&nbsp; justified without&nbsp; any compunction the act of Nero, the sanguinary Roman Emperor, of murdering in cold blood his own mother.&nbsp; It is reproducing&nbsp; the crooked mentality of Torquemada, who, upon the pretext of combating&nbsp; and&nbsp; persecuting heresy to save souls&nbsp; from hell, conceived the diabolical idea&nbsp; of condemning their victims to&nbsp; an advanced version of hell in this life,&nbsp; and among those&nbsp; who suffered under the same spirit of intolerance and bigotry which was its very essence are counted&nbsp; some of the greatest human characters, such as Galileo, Giordano Bruno,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Girolamo Savonarola.&nbsp; That procedure might find justification in the thick heads&nbsp; of the Avars, Huns, Vandals, and Teutons, or&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; stratified mentality of Japanese cullions, but not in a healthy mind of a cultured person of modern times.&nbsp; To&nbsp; allow&nbsp; any vestige of&nbsp; such procedure to remain&nbsp; is tantamount to reviving the situation during which&nbsp; our&nbsp; citizens endured sleepless&nbsp; nights in constant fear of the hobnail terror stalking in the darkness, when&nbsp; their personal&nbsp; security&nbsp; and their life were hanging by the thin fibre of chance.</p> <p>We wish a way could be found&nbsp; to free completely our people of the&nbsp; sense&nbsp; of shame, which they&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; help feeling, engendered by members of our race who justified such abhorrent summary procedure and allowed themselves to become a&nbsp; party to the execution of a scheme only acceptable to the undeveloped mentalities of the dark ages. It is a shame that makes our blood boil when we think that countrymen of&nbsp; Father&nbsp; Gomez, of Rizal, of&nbsp; Mabini, could accept procedures representing the brutal ideology which is the very opposite of the humane, lofty, and dignified ideology that placed said heores and martyrs among the purest and noblest specimens that humanity produced in all&nbsp; countries,&nbsp; in&nbsp; all time, and&nbsp; for all&nbsp; ones and&nbsp; light years to come.</p> <p>It is with joy and pride that we agree with&nbsp; all our brethren in unanimously granting petitioner the redress he seeks in his petition.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p> <p><strong>HILADO, J.,&nbsp; </strong></p> <p>I concur in the result, as&nbsp; well as in the&nbsp; reasons stated in the majority&nbsp; opinion not&nbsp; inconsistent with&nbsp; the views expressed in my dissenting opinion in&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; No. L-5, Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (p. 199, <em>ante</em>).</p> <p>However, I would additionally base my conclusion&nbsp; upon broader grounds.</p> <p>Firstly, I reiterate here by reference the arguments advanced in said dissenting opinion in additional support of the conclusion that the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of mandamus herein sought should be granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the importance&nbsp; and transcendence of the legal&nbsp; principles involved justify&nbsp; further elaboration.</p> <p>From the allegations of the petition herein,&nbsp; it can be deduced that the petitioner William F. Peralta was a "guerrillero" when he&nbsp; was arrested,&nbsp; tried and convicted; and that he had never voluntarily submitted to the Japanese forces in&nbsp; his civil capacity.</p> <p>No attempt is made in the Solicitor General's&nbsp; answer to controvert the facts alleged in the petition from&nbsp; which the foregoing deduction&nbsp; flows, and&nbsp; from the record&nbsp; nothing appears which may tend to gainsay them.&nbsp; Even when he ¦was forced temporarily to join the Constabulary, which had been organized&nbsp; under orders of the Japanese Army in the&nbsp; Philippines, he&nbsp; did so against his will.</p> <p>Even granting for the sake of argument, and laying aside for the moment the reasons to&nbsp; the&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; set forth in my aforesaid dissenting opinion, that&nbsp; the rules of International Law regarding the&nbsp; power of a belligerent army iof occupation to establish a provisional government in an occupied&nbsp; enemy territory, are still binding upon the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines, yet such , rules would not be of any avail to bind the herein petitioner by the laws, regulations,&nbsp; processes and other acts of the so-called&nbsp; "Republic of the Philippines", under and by virtue of which said petitioner has been convicted to life imprisonment by the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction of Manila in Criminal Case No. 66 thereof.</p> <p>If we analyze the different adjudications and treatises which have been cited in support of the validity or binding force of&nbsp; the acts of such provisional governments, which have been variously called <em>de facto</em> governments, or governments of paramount force, with&nbsp; a&nbsp; view&nbsp; to finding the real ground, and philosophical justification for the&nbsp; doctrine therein announced, we will see&nbsp; that that reason and that justification are made&nbsp; to&nbsp; consist in&nbsp; the <em>submission</em> of the inhabitants upon whom the&nbsp; said acts have&nbsp; been held to be of obligatory or binding force, to the army of occupation. Thus, to cite just a few typical examples, we&nbsp; quote the following excerpts from three leading cases&nbsp; decided&nbsp; by the Supreme Court of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States:</p> <p>Excerpts from Thorington <em>vs.</em> Smith (8&nbsp; Wall.&nbsp; [U. S.], 1; 19 Law.&nbsp; ed., 361) :</p> <blockquote> <p>"That while&nbsp; it (government of paramount force) exists,&nbsp; it must necessarily be&nbsp; obeyed in civil matters by private&nbsp; citizens who, by acts&nbsp; of&nbsp; obedience, rendered&nbsp; in&nbsp; <em>submission</em> to such force,&nbsp; do not become responsible, as wrong-doers, for those acts, though not warranted by the laws&nbsp; of the rightful government"&nbsp; (p. 363; italics ours).</p> <p>"'The authority of the United States over the territory was suspended,&nbsp; and the laws&nbsp; of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States could no&nbsp; longer be rightfully enforced there, or be obligatory upon the inhabitants who <em>remained and submitted&nbsp; to the conqueror.</em>'"&nbsp; (P. 364; italics ours.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Excerpts&nbsp; from&nbsp; Fleming <em>vs.</em> Page&nbsp; (9 Howard.&nbsp; [U. S.], 603;&nbsp; 13 Law. ed., 276) :</p> <blockquote> <p>"While it (Tampico) was occupied by our troops,&nbsp; they were in an enemy's country, and not in their own;&nbsp; the&nbsp; inhabitants were still foreigners and enemies, and owed to the United States&nbsp; nothing more than the&nbsp; <em>submission</em> and obedience,&nbsp; sometimes called&nbsp; temporary allegiance, which is due from a conquered enemy, when he <em>surrenders</em> to a force which&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; unable to&nbsp; resist."&nbsp; (P. 281; italics ours.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Excerpts from United States <em>vs.</em> Rice (4 Wheat [U. S.], 246; 4 Law. ed., 562) :</p> <blockquote> <p>"The sovereignty of the United States over the&nbsp; territory was, of course, suspended, and the laws of the United States could no longer be rightfully enforced there,&nbsp; or be obligatory upon the inhabitants who&nbsp; <em>remained</em> and submitted to the conquerors."&nbsp;&nbsp; (P, 564; italics ours.)</p> </blockquote> <p>It&nbsp; results from the above-quoted pronouncements of the Supreme Court of the United States that&nbsp; the laws, regulations, processes and other acts&nbsp; of the government that the occupying belligerent establishes are made binding only and precisely upon those&nbsp; inhabitants from whom obedience could be&nbsp; effectively&nbsp; exacted,&nbsp; namely, those who&nbsp; remain within the effective reach of the occupying forces&nbsp; and&nbsp; submit to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is plain common sense.&nbsp; Those who conceived and developed the doctrine could not logically have thought&nbsp; of the army&nbsp; of occupation setting upon a civil government for those&nbsp; who still continued resistance.&nbsp; As to them,&nbsp; further military operations would be necessary to reduce them to submission, before one could think of civilly governing them.</p> <p>In&nbsp; the Philippines,&nbsp; during the occupation by the Japanese of Manila and certain other portions of the Archipelago, the overwhelming majority of the people never submitted to the&nbsp; Japanese invaders, and never recognized any legality in&nbsp; the invasion of their country, and to the very date of liberation&nbsp; refused to accept the alleged protection or benefits of the&nbsp; puppet governments of the "Philippine Executive Commission" and the "Republic of the Philippines."&nbsp; The majority of our people lived in the provinces, in the farms, hills and&nbsp; other places beyond the&nbsp; effective reach of the Japanese military garrisons.&nbsp; Only a small minority submitted to the invaders for various reasons, such as their having been caught in Manila or other parts of the Islands occupying government positions, or residing therein without adequate&nbsp; facilities for&nbsp; escaping from or evading said invaders, reasons of&nbsp; ill health, disabling them from living the&nbsp; hard life of&nbsp; the mountains, hills,&nbsp; or country places, and the like.</p> <p>To have bound those of our people who constituted the great majority who never submitted to the Japanese oppressors, by the laws, regulations, processes and other acts of those two puppet governments, would not only have been utterly unjust and downright illegal, but would have placed them in the&nbsp; absurd and impossible condition&nbsp; of being simultaneously submitted to two mutually hostile governments, with their&nbsp; respective constitutional&nbsp; and&nbsp; legislative enactments and institutions—on the one&nbsp; hand bound to continue&nbsp; owing allegiance to the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; and the Commonwealth&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; other, to&nbsp; owe allegiance, if only temporary, to Japan.&nbsp; Among them we find the&nbsp; petitioner William F.&nbsp; Peralta.&nbsp; The surrender of the Fil-American forces in Bataan and Corregidor did not matter so far as this was concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much less&nbsp; did that surrender obligate all the civil population to submit to the Japanese, and obey&nbsp; all their future dictations. If it did, President Roosevelt&nbsp; and President Osmeiia would not have so&nbsp; heartily commended the Philippine resistance movement and so enthusiastically extolled the firm stand of those who participated therein,&nbsp; in the former's message of&nbsp; October 23, 1943,&nbsp; and in the latter's speech of Febuary 27, 1945, cited in&nbsp; the&nbsp; writer's above mentioned dissenting opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these historic utterances should&nbsp; seem&nbsp; incompatible with any provision of&nbsp; the Hague Convention, we should understand from them that both Presidents must have considered such provision as no longer applicable to, or binding upon, the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Philippines. Who knows but that&nbsp; their attitude&nbsp; was based upon&nbsp; the renunciation of war&nbsp; as an&nbsp; instrument of national policy by their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; peoples,&nbsp; which renunciation&nbsp; necessarily includes all the "rights" or "powers" which may be claimed to be derived from war so employed?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else, upon&nbsp; the ground that such provision does not support the wrongful acts of Japan in the Philippines?</p> <p>Another reason advanced to justify the creation of a provisional civil government, with its courts and other departments, in&nbsp; occupied&nbsp; enemy territory, is&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged convenience of the civil population.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; can&nbsp; immediately be asserted in reply that the&nbsp; convenience of the above- mentioned overwhelming majority of our people, far from requiring the establishment of&nbsp; such a government, was in the very nature of things positively opposed thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; They not only&nbsp; did not need the supposed benefits of such a government, but&nbsp; they&nbsp; actually reputed&nbsp; them as&nbsp; inimical to the larger interest of the very ideology and cause for which they were continuing their resistance to those who would extend here the brutal power and&nbsp; pernicious influence of the&nbsp; now&nbsp; exploded&nbsp; "Greater&nbsp; East&nbsp; Asia&nbsp; Co-Prosperity Sphere."&nbsp; They suffered, yes, and suffered much—but they placed that ideology and that cause high above their private comfort.&nbsp; Let us not penalize them for it.&nbsp; If this government is democratic, and when it comes to a question of convenience,&nbsp; whose&nbsp; will&nbsp; and whose&nbsp; convenience&nbsp; should prevail, that of the majority&nbsp; or that of the&nbsp; minority? Are we going to&nbsp; force those&nbsp; free&nbsp; citizens&nbsp; of this free country to accept the alleged benefits and assume the burdens of a government they have never consented to own?</p> <p>I am, furthermore, of opinion that there is another important consideration which argues against the recognition of the said government as a <em>de facto</em> government or government of paramount force during the Japanese occupation of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands.&nbsp; Japan, in starting and prosecuting this war against the United States and her allies by breaking the most vital rules of civilized warfare as prescribed by International Law, must be deemed to have forfeited the right&nbsp; to invoke that law in so far as specific provisions thereof would favor her or her acts.&nbsp; Japan in treacherously attacking Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, successively&nbsp; on&nbsp; December&nbsp; 7 and&nbsp; 8, 1941, violated the rule providing&nbsp; for&nbsp; the necessity&nbsp; of&nbsp; declaring war as established at the&nbsp; Hague Conference of 1907 (Lawrence, Principles of International Law, 7th ed., pp. 321-322, 325); she has infringed the rule requiring that war prisoners be cared for and treated with humanity (<em>Ibid</em>, p. 377); the rule imposing the obligation to properly tend the sick and wounded (<em>Ibid</em>, 384), the rule interdicting bombing of open and defenseless cities (<em>Ibid,</em> 522, 523)&nbsp; when&nbsp; she bombed Manila&nbsp; after it had been declared an open city and all its military defenses had&nbsp; been removed; the rule exempting noncombatants from personal injury&nbsp; (<em>Ibid</em>, 397)—her violations of one or the other&nbsp; of which were matters of daily occurrence, one might say, during her three and a half years of tyranny and oppression in this country, and were&nbsp; climaxed by the ignominious and indescribable atrocities of&nbsp; the mass massacre of innocent&nbsp; civilians&nbsp; during the battle for&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the interpretation of doubtful provisions of International&nbsp; Law, Doctor Lawrence,&nbsp; in his work cited above, has the following to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; if a point of Municipal Law is doubtful, men resort to supreme court for a decision, or to a&nbsp; supreme legislature&nbsp; for&nbsp; an interpreting statute; but if a point of International Law is doubtful, they can resort only to general reasoning for a convincing argument, unless, indeed, they settle the question by blows. And International Law in many of its details is peculiarly liable to disputes and doubts, because it is based an usage and opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; He who in such a case bases his&nbsp; reasoning on high&nbsp; considerations of morality may&nbsp; succeed in resolving the&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; humanity and justice." (Pp. 12,&nbsp; 13.)</p> </blockquote> <p>It would seem that to deny Japan&nbsp; the&nbsp; benefits, because she has refused to carry the burdens of the&nbsp; law, is to base our reasoning&nbsp; "on high considerations of morality", and to resolve any doubt, if doubt there be, as to the point&nbsp; in question, "in accordance with humanity and justice."&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words (even if we applied said rules to the instant case), Japan, under the circumstances&nbsp; of this case, could not be heard to say that the government&nbsp; which she established here was a<em> de facto</em> government, or a&nbsp; government of paramount force, as in the cases where such a government was deemed to exist.</p> <p>In&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to what&nbsp; has been&nbsp; said above, let&nbsp; us see if the Japanese-sponsored&nbsp; "Republic of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines" did not&nbsp; introduce such fundamental&nbsp; and drastic changes in the political organization of this country, as it existed upon the date of the Japanese invasion, as&nbsp; to vitiate with invalidity the acts of all its departments, executive, judicial, and legislative.&nbsp; To begin&nbsp; with, the&nbsp; Commonwealth Constitution was completely overthrown.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; replaced&nbsp; by the&nbsp; so-called constitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the "Republic."&nbsp; A&nbsp; casual comparison of these two instruments&nbsp; cannot fail to reveal a most revolutionary transformation of the political organization of the&nbsp; country.&nbsp; While under the Commonwealth Constitution the&nbsp; retention&nbsp; of American&nbsp; sovereignty over the Philippines&nbsp; is expressly recognized, for the purposes specified in the ordinance appended thereto, in the very preamble of the constitution of the "Republic"&nbsp; the&nbsp; "independence" of the Philippines is proclaimed.&nbsp; While under the Commonwealth&nbsp; Constitution the President&nbsp; and Vice- President are elected "by direct vote of the people" Art. VII, sec. 2), under the constitution of the "Republic" the President (no Vice-President is provided for) was elected "by majority of all the members of the National Assembly" (Art. II, sec. 2).&nbsp; While under the Commonwealth Constitution the legislative power is vested in a bicameral Congress with, a Senate&nbsp; and a House of Representatives (Art. VI, sec.&nbsp; 1), under the constitution&nbsp; of the "Republic" that power was vested in&nbsp; a unicameral National Assembly (Art III, sec.&nbsp; 3).&nbsp; While&nbsp; under the Commonwealth Constitution the Senators are chosen at&nbsp; large by the qualified electors of the Philippines&nbsp; (Art. VI, sec, 2) and the Representatives by the qualified electors in the respective districts (Art. VI, sec.&nbsp; 5), under the constitution of the "Republic" the National Assembly was&nbsp; composed&nbsp; of the provincial governors and&nbsp; city mayors as members&nbsp; ex-oficio, and of&nbsp; delegates elected every&nbsp; three years, one from each&nbsp; and every province and chartered city (Art. Ill, sec. 2).&nbsp;&nbsp; While under the Commonwealth Constitution, respecting the Judicial Department, the members of the Supreme&nbsp; Court and&nbsp; all judges of inferior courts are appointed by the President with the&nbsp; consent of the Commission on Appointments of the Congress (Art. VIII, sec. 5), under the&nbsp; constitution of the "Republic"&nbsp; the members of the Supreme Court were appointed by the President with&nbsp; the&nbsp; advice of the Cabinet, and all judges of inferior courts, by the&nbsp; President with the advice of the Supreme Court (Art. IV,&nbsp; sec.&nbsp; 4).</p> <p>These&nbsp; changes and innovations can be multiplied&nbsp; many times,&nbsp; but the foregoing will suffice for our purpose.</p> <p>It has&nbsp; been said constantly in this discussion that political acts,&nbsp; or acts of&nbsp; a political&nbsp; complexion&nbsp; of a <em>de facto</em> government or a government of paramount&nbsp; force, are the only ones vitiated with nullity.&nbsp; Of course, I disagree with those who so hold.&nbsp; But even by this test the "Republic"— or, which is the same, the Imperial Japanese Forces-which gave&nbsp; it birth—in thus introducing&nbsp; such positive&nbsp; changes in the organization of this country or suspending the working of that already&nbsp; in existence, executed a political act so fundamental&nbsp; and&nbsp; basic in&nbsp; nature and&nbsp; operation&nbsp; that all the subsequent acts of the new government which of course had to be based thereon, inevitably had to be contaminated by the same vitiating defect.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Thus&nbsp; judicial acts done tinder his&nbsp; control,&nbsp; when they are&nbsp; not of a political complexion, administrative acts so done, to the extent that they take effect during the&nbsp; continuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; control, and the various acts done&nbsp; during the same&nbsp; time&nbsp; by private persons under the sanction&nbsp; of municipal law, remain good. *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Political acts&nbsp; on the other&nbsp; hand fall through&nbsp; as&nbsp; of course, whether they&nbsp; introduce any positive change into the&nbsp; <em>organization</em> of&nbsp; the<em> country,</em> or whether they only <em>suspend</em> the working of that already in existence.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Hall, International Law, 6th ed., p. 483;<em> italics ours.</em>)</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, upon close scrutiny, we will find that all of the<em> de facto</em> governments or governments of paramount force which have (been cited in all this discussion were at the same time <em>bona fide</em> governments.&nbsp; The British established such&nbsp; a&nbsp; government&nbsp; in&nbsp; Castine, and&nbsp; ran&nbsp; it as&nbsp; a purely British&nbsp; organization, The Americans&nbsp; established another such&nbsp; government in&nbsp; Tampico, and ran it as an American organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Confederate&nbsp; States established a like government in the seceding States, and ran it as the&nbsp; Government of the Confederacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were&nbsp; all frank, sincere, und honest in their deeds as well as in their words.&nbsp; But what happened&nbsp; in this country during&nbsp; the Japanese&nbsp; occupation? When the "Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines" was established on October 14, 1943, under duress&nbsp; exerted by the Japanese Army,&nbsp; did the Japanese openly, frankly, and sincerely say that that&nbsp; government was&nbsp; being&nbsp; established under their&nbsp; orders&nbsp; and was to&nbsp; be&nbsp; run subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; their direction and control?&nbsp; Far from it!&nbsp; They employed all the means they could conceive to deceive the Filipino people and the&nbsp; outside world&nbsp; that&nbsp; they had given the&nbsp; Filipinos their independence, and that the Filipino people had drafted their own constitution&nbsp; and&nbsp; established that&nbsp; "Republic" thereunder.&nbsp; But&nbsp; behind the curtain,&nbsp; from beginning to end, there was the Imperial&nbsp; Japanese Army giving orders and instructions and otherwise&nbsp; directing and&nbsp; controlling the activities of what&nbsp; really was their&nbsp; creature for the furtherance of their war aims.&nbsp; I cannot believe that those who conceived&nbsp; and developed the doctrine of&nbsp; <em>de&nbsp; facto</em> government or&nbsp; government&nbsp; of paramount force, ever intended to include therein such a counterfeit organization as the Japanese contrived here—an organization which, like its counterparts in Manchukuo,&nbsp; Nanking,&nbsp; Burma,&nbsp; and Vichy, has been appropriately called "puppet" by the civilized governments of the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p align="center"><em>CONCURRENTE</em></p> <p><strong>BRIONES, M.,</strong></p> <p>El mandamiento de <em>habeas corpus</em> que se solicita&nbsp; debe concederse.</p> <p>La proclama&nbsp; del General&nbsp; MacArthur de 23&nbsp; de Octubre de&nbsp; 1944, lanzada cuatro dias despues de su desembarco en Leyte&nbsp; con&nbsp; las&nbsp; fuerzas&nbsp; libertadoras,&nbsp; reza&nbsp; en&nbsp; parte&nbsp; lo siguiente:</p> <blockquote> <p>"3. Que todas las leyes, regulaciones y procesos de cualquier otro gobierno en Filipinas que no fuera el del Commonwealth son nulos e invalidos y caxecen de ef ecto legal en areas de Filipinas liberadas de la ocupacion y control del enemigo."</p> </blockquote> <p>Recienteimente se ha discutido&nbsp; mucho&nbsp; en&nbsp; esta jurisdiccion sobre si la anulacion de que trata dicha&nbsp; proclama puede&nbsp; referirse&nbsp; tambien a actuaciones judiciales&nbsp; (<em>judicial processes</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp; En el asunto de Co&nbsp; Kim Cham&nbsp; <em>contra</em> Valdez Tan Keh y Dizon, R. G. No.&nbsp; L-5&nbsp; (pag. 113,&nbsp; <em>ante</em>), he opinado afirmativamente, esto es, que&nbsp; el alcance&nbsp; de esa proclama&nbsp; puede extenderse a veces a ciertos actos o <em>procesos judiciales</em>.&nbsp; Reafirmo ahora mi opinion y con mayor vigor y enfasis si cabe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Porque, a mi&nbsp; juicio, la sentencia de reclusion perpetua impuesta al recurrente bajo la ocupacion militar japonesa es de aquellos actos judiciales del pasado regimen que por su naturaleza&nbsp; y circunstancias reclaman una decidida y pronta accion de parte nuestra en el sentido de aziularla y dejarla sin efecto.&nbsp; Mis razones se exponen a continuacion.</p> <p>Parece innegable&nbsp; que la ley&nbsp; procesal bajo la cual fue enjuiciado y convicto el&nbsp; recurrente durante la ocupacion japonesa era absolutamente incompatible con las salvaguardias y garantias de un proceso justo, imparcial y ordenado que la&nbsp; constitucidn&nbsp;&nbsp; y&nbsp; legislacion&nbsp; procesal&nbsp; del&nbsp; Commonwealth de Filipinas&nbsp; otorgan&nbsp; a todo acusado en una causa criminal.&nbsp; Hay&nbsp; en dicha ley ciertos aspectos&nbsp; decididamente repulsivos para&nbsp; una&nbsp; conciencia disciplinada&nbsp; en las normas y principios de&nbsp; una&nbsp; democracia constitucional Bajo&nbsp; nuestro&nbsp; sistema&nbsp; procesal el acusado tiene&nbsp; derecho a que no se le ponga en situacion de acriminarse.&nbsp; Tiene derecho a callarse sin que por esto pueda atribuirsele cargo inculpatorio alguno.&nbsp;&nbsp; Este es un derecho fundamental, ga- rantido&nbsp; por la constitucion.</p> <p>Empero bajo&nbsp; el sistema procesal que se discute, "la negativa del acusado&nbsp; a contestar&nbsp; cualquiera&nbsp; pregunta&nbsp; formulada&nbsp; por el tribunal o permitida&nbsp; por el&nbsp; mismo, puede ser considerada&nbsp; en contra de dicho acusado."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Seccion 21, Orden Ejecutiva No. 157.)&nbsp; Bajo este&nbsp; mismo sistema&nbsp; el caracter sumarlsimo del&nbsp; proceso llega a tal extremo qne "una&nbsp; sentencia&nbsp; condenatoria puede&nbsp; dictarse inmediatamente contra el acusado&nbsp; siempre que&nbsp; los&nbsp; hechos descubiertos en el <em>interrogatorio preliminar</em> demuestren que&nbsp; el acusado es culpable."</p> <p>Bajo&nbsp; el sistema procesal del Commonwealth, cualquier acusado convicto ante el Juzgado de Primera Instancia tiene el derecho de apelar de la sentencia para ante el Tribunal superior de revision; y en los casos de condena a reclusion perpetua o a muerte, el&nbsp; Tribunal&nbsp; Supremo&nbsp; es el llamado a revisar la causa, siendo compulsoria la revision en el caso de condena&nbsp; a muerte.&nbsp; Esta jurisdiccion en&nbsp; apelacion del Tribunal Supremo en los casos de condena a reclusion perpetua y a muerte no se halla estatuida simplemente por una ley ordinaria, sino que esta proveida en la misma constitution del&nbsp; Commonwealth.&nbsp; Asi que el derecho del condenado a reclusion perpetua o a&nbsp; muerte para que se revise su causa por el Tribunal Supremo es constitucional y, por ende, no puede ser abolido por un simple <em>fiat</em> legislativo.</p> <p>En camibio, bajo el sistema procesal en controversia las sentencias de los tribunales especiales o sumarias eran&nbsp; de caracter&nbsp; final, excepto cuando la pena impuesta fuera la de muerte, en cuyo easo los autos se elevaban en consulta a una division especial del Tribunal&nbsp; Supremo compuesta&nbsp; de tres miembros (Ordenanza No. 7 de la llaniada Republica de Filipinas por la que se crearon las tribunales especiaies o sumarios).&nbsp; De modo que en esta ordenanza&nbsp; no solo se suprimia de una plumada el derecho de apelar reconocido y establecido por la legislacion procesal del Commonwealth aun en los casos de delitos y penas ordinaries, sino que inclusive quedaba abolido el derecho de apelar otorgado por la constitution del Commonwealth al&nbsp; acusado condenado a reclusion perpetua.&nbsp; Por este motivo el recurrente, a quien se le habia impuesto esta pena por&nbsp; el alegado delito&nbsp; de robo, no pudo apelar de la sentencia para ante el Tribunal Supremo.</p> <p>La cuestion que ahora tenemos que determinar y resolver es si debemos reconocer validez&nbsp; y eficacia en la sentencia por la cual el recurrente se halla extinguiendo su condena de reclusion perpetua, o debemos anularla ahora que esta en nuestras manos el poder hacerlo, restablecida como esta enteramente&nbsp; la&nbsp; normalidad&nbsp; juridica y&nbsp; constitucional en nuestro pais.</p> <p>En favor de la validez de dicha sentencia se arguye que fue dictada por un tribunal creado&nbsp; por un gobierno&nbsp; <em>de facto</em>;&nbsp; que aun admitiendo el caracter inquisitorial, anti-democratico de la&nbsp; ley procesal bajo la cual&nbsp; fue&nbsp; enjuiciado el acusado,&nbsp; el gobierno <em>de facto</em> era dueno de&nbsp; establecer los&nbsp; procedimientos&nbsp; legates que quisiera; y&nbsp; que,&nbsp; segun las reglas y doctrinas conocidas&nbsp; de derecho internacional, las sentencias por "crimenes de&nbsp; guerra" o "delitos politicos" generalmente validas&nbsp; aun&nbsp; despues&nbsp; de restablecido el gobierno <em>de jure</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Se alega que en estos casos el derecho no tiene mas remedio que ceder a la fuerza, aeeptando la realidad de los heehos consumados.</p> <p>Se admite, sin embargo, que la&nbsp; regla tiene sus excepciones.&nbsp; Una de ellas es que "los actos del ocupante militar que rebasen su poder a&nbsp; tenor del criterio establecido&nbsp; en&nbsp; el articulo 43 de las Regulaeiones de La Haya, son nulos&nbsp; y sin efecto con relacion al gobierno&nbsp; legitimo."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Wheaton's International Law, 7th ed. [1944], p. 245.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Segiin esto, ias sentencias por "crimenes de&nbsp; guerra" o "delitos politicos" cometidos durante la ocupacion son, por razones perfectamente comprensibles, nulas e invalidas al restablecerse Ja soberania legitima.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tambien quedan comprendidos&nbsp; bajo esta excepcion los denominados actos de caracter o complexion politica. </p> <p>Otra&nbsp; limitacion a los&nbsp; poderes de&nbsp; un gobierno de ocupacion militar es que el ejercicio de&nbsp; tales poderes debe extenderse tan solo hasta donde fuese necesario para&nbsp; su seguridad y el exito de&nbsp; sus operaciones, teniendo particularmente en cuenta el caracter transeunte de su ocupacion. Como regla general, al invasor se le <em>prohibe alterar o suspender las leyes referentes a la propiedad y a las relaeiones personates privadas, o las leyes que&nbsp; regulan el orden moral de la comunidad</em>.&nbsp; (Hall, Treatise&nbsp; on International&nbsp; Law, 7th ed., pp. 498, 499).&nbsp; Lo que se hace fuera de estas&nbsp; limitaciones es&nbsp; en exceso de su competencia y es generalmente nulo al restaurarse la soberania legitima.</p> <p>Otra&nbsp; excepcion es la&nbsp; que se refiere a&nbsp; los actos de un gobierno de faoto resultante de una insurreccion, rebelion, revolucion o guerra civil.&nbsp; A este efecto se ha declarado, por ejemplo, que los actos en fomento o apoyo de una rebelion contra los&nbsp; Estados Unidos, <em>o encaminados a anular los jusios dereehos de los ciudadanos</em>, y otros actos de igual indole, <em>deben ser considerados, por lo general, invdlidos y nulos</em> (Texas <em>vs.</em> White, 74 U.&nbsp; S.,&nbsp; 733;&nbsp; 19 Law, edv 240). En otro caso se ha declarado&nbsp; la validez de ciertos actos judiciales o legislatives en estados insurreccionados, <em>siempre, que su proposito o modo de operation no fwere hostil a la autoridad del gobierno national, o no eonculcaren derechos de los ciudademos bajo&nbsp; la Constitution</em>.—Horn&nbsp; vs. Lockhart, 17 Well, 570-581;&nbsp; 2 Law. ed., 660.)</p> <p>Visto el caso que nos ocupa a la luz de estas doctrinas, ¿cual de ellas debemos adoptar para determinar si es o no valida la&nbsp; sentencia por&nbsp; la cual el recurrente sufre ahora pena&nbsp; de reclusion perpetua&nbsp; y pide ser&nbsp; liberado&nbsp; mediante peticion de&nbsp; <em>habeas corpus</em>?</p> <p>Se&nbsp; asevera que no&nbsp; procede aplicar al&nbsp; presente caso la doctrina establecida en la jurisprudencia americana sobre gobiernos <em>de&nbsp; facto</em> resultantes&nbsp; de&nbsp; una insurreccion, revolucion o guerra civil porque evidentemente la llamada Reptiblica de Filipinas instaurada durante la ocupacion militar japonesa no&nbsp; tenia este caracter, sino que era mas bien un gobierno&nbsp; establecido mediante&nbsp; fuerza y coaccion por los mismos invasores para promover ciertos designios politicos relacionados&nbsp; con sus fines de guerra.&nbsp;&nbsp; En otras&nbsp; palabras, era el mismo gobierno militar de ocupacion&nbsp; con fachada filipina arreglada y arbitrada coercitivamente.</p> <p>Mientras estoy&nbsp; conforme con una parte de la&nbsp; asercion, esto es, que la aludida repiiblica no tenia caracter insurreccional ni&nbsp; revolucionario,&nbsp; en disfrute de plena autonomia, sino que era simple pro duct o de la coaccion y estaba&nbsp; mediatizada&nbsp; continuamente por&nbsp; el invasor,&nbsp; dinero de la otra parte, aquella que declara inaplicable&nbsp; la&nbsp; conocida doctrina americana mencionada arriba sobre gobiernos <em>de facto</em> establecidos en el&nbsp; curso de una insurreccion, revolucion o guerra civil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Y la razon es sencilla.&nbsp; Si a un gobierno <em>de facto</em> de este ultimo tipo—gobierno establecido, despues de todo,&nbsp; por compatriotas, por&nbsp; conciudadanos—se&nbsp; le coarta con la restriecion de que sus actos&nbsp; legislativos o judiciales, en tanto son validos, al restaurarse el regimen <em>de jure</em>, en cuanto no conculcaren<em> los derechos justos de los civdadanos, a los derechos garantidos por la constitution</em>, pareee que no existe ninguna razon por que no se ha de aplicar la misma restriceion al gobierno de facto establecido como incidente de una guerra entre dos naciones independientes y enemigas.&nbsp; En realidad, la razon de nulidad es mucho mas poderosa y fuerte cuando, en su caso como el de Filipinas, el enemigo invasor inicio la agresion de una manera inicua y traicionera y&nbsp; la ejecuto luego con vesania y sadismo&nbsp; que llegaron a extremos inconcebibles de&nbsp; barbarie.&nbsp; En&nbsp; este caso la condulcacion de los justos derechos de los ciudadanos, o&nbsp; de los derechos garantidos por la constitucion cobra proporciones de&nbsp; mucha mayor gravedad&nbsp; porque&nbsp; viene a ser tan solo parte de un vasto plan de rapina, devastation y atrocidades de todo genero cometidas contra la humanidad y contra las leyes y usos&nbsp; de la guerra entre&nbsp; naciones civilizadas.&nbsp; El&nbsp; invasor, en&nbsp; este caso, es como el foragido que se coloca fuera de toda ley.&nbsp; Por tanto, no hay absolutamente ninguna razon para no aplicarle una restriceion que se estima buena para el insurrecto o revolucionario.</p> <p>La ventaja&nbsp; de extender hasta cierto punto la doctrina sobre gobiernos <em>de facto</em> resultantes de una insurrection, rebelion o guerra civil&nbsp; a&nbsp; gobiernos de facto establecidos como incidente en el curso&nbsp; de una guerra entre dos naciones independientes enemigas es que, frente a casos de conculcacion de los <em>justos derechos&nbsp; de los ciudadanos, o&nbsp; de los derechos garantidos por la constitucion</em> para los efectos de declararlos validos o nulos al restablecerse el gobierno de jure, ya no se hace&nbsp; preciso examinar si los actos conculcatorios&nbsp; fueron motivados por razones o exigencias de la seguridad y exito de las operaciones del ocupante militar, sino que la piedra de toque de la validez o nulidad viene a ser tan&nbsp; solo el acto&nbsp; positivo mismo&nbsp; de&nbsp; la conculcacion.</p> <p>Esta forma de raciocinio no solo no es heterodoxa&nbsp; a la luz de los principios establecidos de derecho international, sino pareee ser una Mgica inferencia&nbsp; de los mismos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ya hemos visto que al ocupante&nbsp; militar&nbsp; en&nbsp; el curso&nbsp; de&nbsp; una guerra international <em>se le prohibe, como regla general, alterar&nbsp; o suspender las leyes references a la propiedad y a las relaciones personates&nbsp; privadas, o las leyes&nbsp; que regulan el or den moral de la eomunidad. </em>(Hall, Treatise on International Law, supra.)&nbsp; Ahora cabe preguntar:&nbsp;&nbsp; ¿Son los justos derechos de los ciudadanos, b los fundamentals garantidos por&nbsp; la&nbsp; eonstitucion&nbsp; inferiores en categoria&nbsp; a&nbsp; la propiedad, o a las relaeiones personates privadas, o al orden moral de la eomunidad?&nbsp;&nbsp; ¿No son en cierto sentido hasta superiores?&nbsp; Por tanto, a nadie debe&nbsp; chocar que la prohibieion se&nbsp; extienda a&nbsp; estas&nbsp; materias. Es una inclusion perfectamente natural, mas que justificada por los avances y&nbsp; conquistas del moderno derecho&nbsp; internacional.&nbsp; Notese que&nbsp; en las fraguas de esta ultima guerra se han forjado unas modalidades juridicas harto&nbsp; originales&nbsp; que&nbsp; denotan el&nbsp; esfuerzo supremo y gigante de la humanidad&nbsp; por superar&nbsp; la banbarie y&nbsp; por dar&nbsp; al traste con las formulas arcaicas,&nbsp; reaccionarias.&nbsp;&nbsp; Para&nbsp; citar&nbsp;&nbsp; solamente&nbsp;&nbsp; algunos ejemplos los mas destacados, tenemos&nbsp; el enjuiciamiento de los llamados criminales de la&nbsp; guerra,&nbsp; y la responsabilidad que&nbsp; se exige a los jefes&nbsp; militares por las atrocidades cometidas por las tropas bajo su mando.</p> <p>Mi conclusion,&nbsp; por tanto, es que desde cualquier angulo que se mire la sentencia&nbsp; impuesta al recurrente por el tribunal&nbsp; sumario de la&nbsp; llamada republica de Filipinas debe ser declarada&nbsp; nula, acotando&nbsp; las palabras&nbsp; del&nbsp; Procurador General, "no solo por razones fundadas en principios de derecho internacional, sino tambien por la mas apremiante y poderosa de las razones, la&nbsp; de preservar y salvaguardar a&nbsp; nuestros ciudadanos de los actos del enemigo."</p> <p>Dar validez a&nbsp; esa sentencia ahora,&nbsp; en plena atmosfera de libertad que respiran a pulmon lleno de resto de nuestros conciudadanos menos el&nbsp; recurrente&nbsp; y&nbsp; otras que&nbsp; corrieron su suerte durante la ocupacion japonesa, equivaldria tanto como prolongar el&nbsp; regimen de opresidn&nbsp; bajo el&nbsp; cual se tramitd y&nbsp; se dicto&nbsp; la&nbsp; referida sentencia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Es mas, equivaldrfa a sancionar la ideologia totalitaria, despotica, medieval contra la cual nuestro pueblo lucho tan lieroicamente jugandose todo: vida, libertad y bienes materiales.</p> <p>Ciertamente no&nbsp; nos hemos librado de la opresion para llegar a tan irrisorio resultado.</p> <p>Concedase el remedio pedido.<br></p></div><br>
