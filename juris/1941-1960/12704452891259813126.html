				G.R. No. L-2634, December 29, 1949</h4>
				<H3>PACIFIC IMPORTING & EXPORTING CO., PETITIONER, VS. CATALINO TINIO, F.C. STELTON, AND POTENCIANO PECSON, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition to annul the order of the respondent judge 
of Manila dated February 10, 1948, revoking a previous order of the court of May 
30, 1947 that definitely dismissed a certain civil case. The facts are 
these:
<ol><li>On April 15, 1947, respondent Catalino Tinio filed, in the Manila Court of 
First Instance, a complaint to recover from herein petitioner Pacific Importing 
&amp; Exporting Co. (hereafter called Pacific Company) the sum of P24,722.78 as 
commissions due him for sales of merchandise, and from the Manila manager of 
same defendant (F. C. Stelton) the sum of P1,150 as commission for sales of 
other goods (civil case No. 2278).<br><br>
</li><li>By its answer of April 80, 1947, the Pacific Company denied liability, 
alleged that Tinio's employer was F. C. Stelton, and submitted a counterclaim 
for over-payment of commissions.<br><br>
</li><li>On May 12, 1947, the Pacific Company and respondent Tinio filed in the said 
civil case No. 2278 a statement praying for its definite dismissal, and 
declaring that the Pacific Company ceased to be the employer of Tinio as of 
October 1, 1946, and that F. C. Stelton stood liable to Tinio for commissions 
after that date and that the Pacific Company had paid Tinio all commissions due 
before October, 1946.<br><br>
</li><li>As prayed for, an order of definite dismissal was issued on May 30, 1947. 
The Pacific Company alleges (and respondents do not deny) that such order became 
final on June 29, 1947, there having been no appeal.<br><br>
</li><li>However, on February 3, 1948, Catalino Tinio filed a petition to set aside 
the order of dismissal, explaining that he had been fraudulently induced to sign 
it upon the strength of certain specific promises and manifestations made to him 
by the representative of the Pacific Company, promises which said company 
subsequently failed to honor and manifestations which turned out to be 
untrue.<br><br>
</li><li>On February 10, 1948, the court set aside the order of dismissal, dated May 
30, 1947, and revived the case. Then on July 13, 1948, upon a motion for 
reconsideration, it entered an order setting forth that: <br>
<blockquote>
<p>"El arreglo habido entre el demandante y la referida entidad demandada que 
culmino en la peticion de sobreseimiento de esta causa con respecto a la 
referida demandada, se fund6 en que dicha demandada ayudaria y facilitara al 
demandante todas las pruebas necesarias para establecer el hecho de que entre 
dicha demandada y el otro demandado F. C. Stelton hubo un contrato, en virtud 
del cual este ultimo asumia la responsabilidad exclusiva de todos cuantos 
contratos de empleo celebrados por el con las respectivas partes interesadas, 
entre ellos, el contrato celebrado con el aqui demandante. Esta promesa se hizo, 
no solo por la entidad demandada al hacerse el arreglo entre ella y el 
demandante, sino tambien por sus abogados ante este Juzgado, prometiendo 
facilitar el documento o documentos que el demandante necesitaria para probar su 
accion contra el otro demandado Stelton, pero es el hecho que dicha entidad 
demandada no ha cumplido, ni ha querido cumplir, pues al parecer no existe el 
documento o documentos que ha prometido facilitar al 
demandante."</p></blockquote>
</li><li>Another motion to reconsider was filed. It was also denied.<br><br>
</li><li>Hence this petition which is planted on the proposition that the court had 
no jurisdiction to act on the motion of February 3, 1948, because at that time 
the order of dismissal had become final and the six-month period (Rule 38, sec. 
3) within which relief could be asked on the ground of fraud, accident, mistake 
or excusable negligence had expired. </li></ol>
<p align="justify">The petitioner is right. From May 30, 1947 to February 3, 1948 
more than seven months had elapsed. Six months after May 30, 1947 the court lost 
all jurisdiction to entertain motions for relief.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, although we are satisfied, like the court below, 
that plaintiff Tinio had been induced to consent to the dismissal through the 
fraudulent misrepresentations of the Pacific Company, however, due to the 
expiration of the six-month period, we must declare the court without 
jurisdiction to reopen the civil case No. 2278. This, however, will be without 
prejudice to Tinio's right to bring another suit to annul the order of May 30, 
1947 on the ground of fraud (which is obviously extrinsic as distinguished from 
intrinsic)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and at the same time, to 
claim as a second cause of action for recovery of the commissions which he has 
tried to obtain in the aforesaid civil case. On the other hand, the Pacific 
Company should be allowed to repeat, if it so desires, the counterclaim it has 
previously presented against respondent Catalino Tinio. The writ is granted, 
without costs.</p>
