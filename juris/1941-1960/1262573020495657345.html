				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for review of the  decision of the Public  Service Commission denying the petition of petitioner to  register one jitney  (TPU) as reserve. The decision is as follows:<br><blockquote>"This is an  application cf Constancio Manansala, holder of  a 5-year certificate authorizing him to operate on the  lines  Bonifacio Monument-Piers  via  Plaza  Sta.  Cruz and Bonifacio  Monument-Libertad via  Plaza Sta. Cruz, with the use of three  (3) jitneys, for the registration of one  (1) additional unit as reserve. Applicant alleges  in his petition that he  will use  the  additional unit only when  any of his three (3) regular units is under repair and  cannot be operated in  order to provide for continuity of service.  Applicant's certificate contains a condition that during its lifetime, he shall not ask for extension of line or increase of equipment or trips, nor substitution of equipment.<br><br>"(1)  The  cessation of operation by  any jitney operator due to breakage or repair  of equipment will not cause any harm  to the  riding public there are sufficient means of transportation in the City of Manila.<br><br>"(2)  Jitney operators with reserve equipment use the  same for regular operation simultaneously with  the  regular units  in places where stickers are not required  by  the regulations of the Manila Police Department and it is difficult to detect these illegal operations; and,  where stickers  are not required,  they succeed  in  operating these reserve units for regular operation with the use of stickers illegally or improperly obtained,  or  thru the use of fake stickers and this must be checked if the Commission  is to adhere to the established policy of not  increasing  the already sufficient services existing in the City of Manila and suburbs, and the nearby towns of San Juan, Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, Mandaluyong and Makati.<br><br>"In denying this application,  the Commission  announces  it  as its policy that hereafter it will not authorize any reserve equipment for TPU operators in the  Cities of Manila,  Quezon and Pasay, and the nearby towns of San Juan, Caloocan, Malabon,  Navotas, Mandaluyong and Makati  who are not operating  under the regular 25-year certificates."</blockquote>It  is claimed in this  Court, in support  of the  petition for review, that the decision appealed  from  denies  the equal protection of the law, in violation of the constitutional prohibition, for  whereas  the right  to  have reserves  is granted operators  with  25-year certificates, the privilege is denied  to TPU operators.  The claim  is  without merit. TPD operators for a short period cannot claim privileges equal to those holding 25-year certificates.  The certificates of  such TPU  operators  are  by nature limited to  certain specified period of years, and the grant of reserve might later be used as a ground for extending the limited period of their certificates.<br><br>It  is also claimed that  the finding of the Commission that there are more than necessary units of transportation plying in  Manila is not sufficiently borne out  by the  evidence.  This claim is also   without merit,  a competent police officer having testified  that Manila is crowded with buses and jitneys.   Petitioner himself  testified  that there were occasions when his jitneys were not able to make the ordinary runs  because  of  eventual  repairs and that in those instances no  complaints were ever  registered against him.  This tends to support the finding of fact that more than sufficient number of jitneys  are operating in the City, for if there was no such sufficient number, failure of some to operate would be  felt by  the public.  The claim is therefore found to be without merit. <br><br>The third argument  is that the denial of the reserve prayed for by petitioner would make a  holder of public certificate unable to render  an  adequate,  efficient and continuous service.   Our answer to this is  that the Commission must  have found that so  many certificates have been  issued that failure of some to render continuous service does  not necessarily  redound  to  public inconvenience.  The decision of the respondent Commission is certainly  in consonance with the  policy adopted in  the decision, which  policy  seems fully justified  by the  circumstances.  We find no reason for finding that the policy adopted in the decision is not justified by the circumstances. <br><br>The last argument  is that no hearing was  held  on the motion  for reconsideration.  No  rule requires that actual hearing is necessary on a motion for reconsideration. The  practice before the courts  is that a movant  in such kind of a motion sets forth all the grounds in his written motion and does not ordinarily need  another hearing in court where personally he or his counsel would  expound his reasons or grounds for the  reconsideration.  Such actual hearing is not considered, in practice, essential to due process. <br><br>The decision  appealed from  is  hereby affirmed,  with costs against petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
