				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-4548, November 26, 1952</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF DOMINGO DY ALIAS WILLIAM DY CHINCO TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. DOMINGO DY ALIAS WILLIAM DY CHINCO, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The question involved in this appeal is the interpretation of 
the provision of section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended by 
Commonwealth Act No. 535, exempting those "who have resided continuously in the 
Philippines for a period of thirty years or more before filing their 
application" from submitting their declaration of intention as required by 
section 5 of the law. The record shows that petitioner-appellee Domingo Dy, 
<span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> William Dy Chinco, possesses all the qualifications for naturalization, 
but did not file his declaration of intention to become a Filipino citizen one 
year prior to the filing of his petition for admission to Philippine 
citizenship. 
<p align="justify">The record discloses that petitioner-appellee was born in Naga, 
Camarines Sur, on May 19, 1915, and at the age of seven or eight, or in the year 
1923, he went to China with his mother to study, and while he used to go back 
and forth from China to the Philippines during1 school vacations, he did not 
come back to live permanently here until the year 1937. The period during which 
he studied in China is fourteen years, from 1923 to 1937, and if this period is 
not counted as part of the period of his residence in the Philippines, the 
petitioner-appellee would have resided continuously here only from 1937 to 1949, 
the date of the filing of his petition for naturalization, or for a period of 12 
years only. The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur held that the 
petitioner is deemed to have continuously resided in the Philippines during the 
said period of time, because residence in the Philippines is not lost or 
interrupted by the fact that one goes abroad either for vacation or study. 
Against this ruling the Solicitor General, on behalf of the Republic of the 
Philippines, contends on this appeal that there is no satisfactory showing as to 
the domicile of appellee's father while appellee was in China from 1923 to 1937, 
and that the legal provision of continuous residence "contemplates actual and 
substantial residence in the Philippines not only as a tangible evidence of 
intent to reside here, but in order that the petitioner may learn the principles 
and imbibe the spirit of our institutions." </p>
<p align="justify">The first contention of the Solicitor General involves a 
question of fact not disputed by petitioner-appellee. We have examined the 
evidence, and we find absolutely no evidence of the residence of 
petitioner-appellee's father during said period. As a minor child has legal 
residence in that of his father, it can not be said that during the period in 
question (1923-1937) petitioner-appellee's residence was satisfactorily shown to 
have been in the Philippines because of the absence of proof that his father was 
then residing here.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the second contention, we declare that the evident reason 
of section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law in exempting applicants who have 
resided in the country continuously for 30 years or more before the filing of 
their application for Philippine citizenship, is because they have stayed in the 
country for so long a time that they can be presumed to have acquired the 
principles and imbibed the spirit of our institutions, and the community and the 
naturalization service have had full opportunity to observe their conduct. This 
reason is implied from the requirement from the other class of applicants (those 
born in the country and have received their primary and secondary education in 
public schools or those recognized by the Government) also granted similar 
exemption. The law, therefore, contemplates actual and substantial residence 
within the Philippines, not legal residence alone, because only by actual and 
substantial residence may the said qualification be acquired by an applicant.

213.)</p>
<p align="justify">Finding the grounds for the appeal to be well founded, we 
hereby reverse the decision appealed from and dismiss the petition, with costs 
against the petitioner-appellee.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo,</span> and
