				<H3>AMADO P. JALANDONI AND PAZ RAMOS, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS VS. ANGELA MARTIR-GUANZON, IN HER OWN BEHALF AND AS JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE TESTATE ESTATE OF THE  LATE SPOUSES  HILARION AND LIGORIA MARTIR, AND ANTONIO  GUANZON, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by  the spouses  Amado  P. Jalandoni and Paz Ramos  from an order of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros dismissing their complaint in Civil Case No. 3586 of said court.<br><br>It appears that on January 9, 1947, the appellant spouses began a suit (Case No. 573) against the appellees Antonio Guanzon,  et  al., for partition of lots Nos.  130-A, 130-B and  130-F of the Murcia  Cadastre, as well as lots Nos. 1288 and 1376 of the Bogo Cadastre, and for recovery of damages caused by the defendants' unwarranted refusal to recognize plaintiffs' right  and  partition said  lots,  as well as  to account for and deliver plaintiffs' share in  the crops obtained during the agricultural  years from  1941-1942 to 1946-1947.   By decision  of  February  22,  1955, the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental held for plaintiffs  and ordered the partition of the lands involved, but denied their claim for damages because of failure to "prove  the exact and actual damages  suffered by them." <br><br>The decision having become final because none of  the parties  appealed  therefrom, the plaintiffs  instituted  the present action (No.  3586  of the  same  Court of  First Instance)  on August  26,  1955, seeking recovery from  the defendants  of the following amounts:  (1)  P20,000  as moral and exemplary damages due to  suffering,  anguish and  anxiety occasioned by the defendants' refusal to partition the properties involved in the preceding case;  (2) P55,258.20 as share of the products of the property from 1947 (when the preceding case  No. 573 was filed)  until 1955 when judgment  was rendered therein  (3)  P4,689.54 as land  taxes  due and unpaid on the properties involved; and  (4) P2,500 for attorneys' fees. <br><br>Upon motion of defendants, the court a  <span style="font-style: italic;">quo</span> dismissed the second complaint for  failure to state a cause of action; and after their motion to reconsider was denied, plaintiffs appealed to this  Court on points of law. <br><br>We  find the dismissal to have  been correctly entered. Except as concomitant to  physical  injuries, moral  and corrective  damages  (allegedly due to  suffering, anguish and anxiety  caused by the refusal of defendants in 1941 to partition  the  common property)  were  not recoverable under  the Civil Code of  1899 which was the governing law at the time.   Recovery  of  such damages  was established for the first  time in  1950 by the new Civil Code, and can not be made to  apply retroactively to acts that occurred under  the prior  law in  view of the punitive  or deterrent character of these damages.  The rule is expressly  laid down by paragraph 1 of Article 2257 of the new Code: <br><blockquote>"Art. 2257.  Provisions of this Code which attach a civil sanction or penalty or  a deprivation of  rights to  acts or omissions which were not penalized  by the former laws, are not applicable to those who, when said laws  were in  force may have executed the  act or incurred in  the omission  forbidden or condemned by this  Code.</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">*   *   *   *   *   *   *<br></div><br>As to the value of the plaintiffs' share in the products of the  land  during  the time  that the former  action  was pending (which are the damages claimed under the second cause  of  action),  their recovery is  now barred  by  the previous  judgment.  These  damages are but the  result of the  original cause, of action, viz., the continuing refusal by  defendants in  1941 to recognize  the plaintiffs'  right to  an  interest  in  the property.  In the same way  that plaintiffs  claimed  for their  share of  the  produce  from 1941 to 1947, these later damages could have been claimed in the first action, either in the original complaint  (for their existence  could be anticipated  when  the first complaint  was  filed)  or  else by supplemental pleading.  To allow  them  to  be  recovered by subsequent  suit  would be  a violation  of  the rule  against multiplicity of  suits, and specifically  of sections 3 and 4 of Rules 2 of the Rules of  Court, against the splitting  of causes of action,  since these damages spring from the same cause of action that was pleading in  the former case No. 573 between the same parties (Blossom  &amp; Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Manila Gas  Corporation,  55 Phil. 226; Santos <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Moir, 36 Phil. 350; Pascua <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sideco, 24 Phil 26;  Bachrach Motor Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Icarangal, 68 Phil. 287). <br><br>That the former  judgment did not touch  upon these damages is not  material to its conclusive  effect: between the same parties, with the same subject matter and cause of action,  a final judgment  on  the merits is conclusive not  only on  the questions  actually contested and determined, but upon all matters that <span style="font-style: italic;">might have been</span> litigated and decided in the former suit, i.e., all matters properly belonging to the subject of the controversy and within the scope of the  issue  (Peilalosa <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tuason,  22 Phil. 312; National Bank  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Barretto,  52  Phil. 824; Namarco <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Macadaeg, 98 Phil.  185;  52 Off.  Gaz.,  182; Miranda <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tiangco, 96 Phil., 526, 51 Off. Gaz., [3]  1366).  Hence, the rejection of  plaintiffs' claim for damages in Case No. 573 imports denial of  those  now claimed,  since these  are a  mere continuation of the former. <br><br>Anent the land taxes allegedly overdue and unpaid, it is readily apparent  that,  taxes being due to the government, plaintiffs  have no right to compel payment thereof to themselves.   The case  could be otherwise if plaintiffs had paid the taxes to stave off forfeiture  of the common property for tax delinguency; in that  event,  they  could compel  contribution. But the complaint  does not aver any such tax payment. <br><br>Little need be said concerning  the claim for attorneys' fees under the fourth cause of action.  If they be fees for the lawyer's services in the former case,  they are barred from recovery  for  the reasons  already  given; if  for services in the present case, there is no justification therefor, since no  case is made  out for the plaintiffs. The order of dismissal appealed from is  affirmed.   Costs against plaintiffs-appellants.   So ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
