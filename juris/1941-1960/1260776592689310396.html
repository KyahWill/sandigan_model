				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case was initiated by a petition dated February 27, 1956, which was amended on March 8, 1956, whereby the above-named petitioners asked the Court of Agrarian Relations&nbsp; to&nbsp; intervene for the settlement of their&nbsp; issue with respondent Crispin Paras, upon the ground that they re his tenants on several parcels of land situated in the municipality of Zaragoza, province of Nueva Ecija, and that he has refused to allow them to thresh their respective crops and&nbsp; is charging&nbsp; them certain&nbsp; expenses they&nbsp; had never agreed to defray.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent filed an answer&nbsp; admitting the formal allegations of the petition, denying its other allegations and&nbsp; setting up special&nbsp; defenses,&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; a "counterclaim".&nbsp; After the filing of petitioners' "answer to counterclaim,"&nbsp; respondent moved for&nbsp; a "judgment on the pleadings", referring to those relative to his "counter-claim,"&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; the&nbsp; principal&nbsp; allegations thereof&nbsp; had&nbsp; not been denied by the petitioners.&nbsp; There-upon, the case was set for hearing on June 4,&nbsp; 1956, which, on motion&nbsp; of petitioners, was postponed to June 15, 1956, by an order dated&nbsp; June 5, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same, likewise, deferred&nbsp; the resolution of respondent's motion for&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; on the pleadings.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; neither the petitioners,&nbsp; nor their counsel, appeared on June 15, 1956, the petition was dismissed for "lack of interest on the part of petitioners to prosecute their petition", and&nbsp; respondent was allowed to&nbsp; introduce&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; on&nbsp; his&nbsp; "counterclaim".&nbsp; Subsequently, or&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1956, a decision&nbsp; was&nbsp; rendered thereon, the dispositive part of&nbsp; which reads:<br><blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment should be as it is rendered in favor of&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; against petitioners&nbsp; herein.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court hereby authorizes respondent Crispin&nbsp; Paras to eject petitioners from their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; landholdings belonging to&nbsp; him, said&nbsp; respondent, situated&nbsp; at&nbsp; Sta. Lucia,&nbsp; Zaragosa,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, authorizing him also to contract with other tenants to&nbsp; cultivate said landholdings."<br></blockquote>A motion for reconsideration&nbsp; and new trial of the petitioners&nbsp; having been denied by an order&nbsp; dated September 5, 1956, petitioners sought a reconsideration of said order, with&nbsp; the same result.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; the&nbsp; present petition&nbsp; for review by certiorari, filed by the petitioners, who maintain that the lower court erred:&nbsp; (1) in dismissing their petition;&nbsp; (2) in authorizing petitioners'&nbsp; ejectment from the land in&nbsp; question;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; in granting respondent's motion for a judgment on the pleadings; and (4) in denying the aforementioned&nbsp; motions for reconsiderations and&nbsp; new trial&nbsp; of petitioners herein.<br><br>Petitioners&nbsp; allege that their&nbsp; failure to appear at the hearing held on June&nbsp; 15, 1956,&nbsp; was due to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that notice thereof&nbsp; was not served upon their&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp; Nicomedes Cristobal, until one day later, or on June 16,&nbsp; 1956. However, petitioners have not attached to the record before us the pertinent portion of the record&nbsp; in the lower&nbsp; court allegedly bearing out their aforementioned allegation, which is contested by the respondent, who asserts that petitioners "were informed in advance of the scheduled hearing set for June 15,&nbsp; 1956 * * *.",<br><br>Moreover, petitioners' motions for reconsideration and new trial were not supported by&nbsp; any&nbsp; affidavit of merit. Although they attached to their motion for reconsideration and&nbsp; new trial, dated June 26,&nbsp; 1956, the sworn statements of Nicomedes Cristobal and Juan&nbsp; de la Cruz, said statements referred merely to the question whether or not they had been notified of the hearing on June 15,1956.&nbsp; Nothing was said, in those&nbsp; affidavits, regarding the&nbsp; merits of petitioners' claim against the respondent, or the evidence available thereon.&nbsp; In other words, the aforementioned sworn statements&nbsp; do&nbsp; not&nbsp; partake&nbsp; of the nature of affidavits&nbsp; of merits.<br><br>With respect to respondent's motion&nbsp; for a judgment&nbsp; on the pleadings pertinent to his "counterclaim", it should&nbsp; be noted that&nbsp; respondent's "counterclaim"&nbsp; consisted&nbsp; of&nbsp; six (6)&nbsp; paragraphs.&nbsp; The first referred to the, residence&nbsp; of the petitioners.&nbsp; The&nbsp; second alleged:<br><blockquote>"That&nbsp; after the termination of the planting season,&nbsp; all the Petitioners <i>abandoned</i> their landholdings and&nbsp; <i>left the&nbsp; same to the care of nature</i> and were it&nbsp; not for the farm guards and other tenants&nbsp; including the overseer, their respective landholdings would have been destroyed or "would have produced almost&nbsp; nothing."&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>The third averred&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; had&nbsp; not&nbsp; complied with their obligations&nbsp; as tenants, in that&nbsp; they failed&nbsp; to take care&nbsp; of their respective&nbsp; farmholdings and of the growing crops&nbsp; and other improvements entrusted to them with the diligence of a good father of family.&nbsp; The fourth stated that on&nbsp; February 14, 1956,&nbsp; petitioners took&nbsp; about 20 cavanes of palay from the stocks still unthreshed in the land in&nbsp; question without the consent of, either respondent or his representative.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fifth and sixth paragraphs, respondent asserted that petitioners had, moreover, violated their contracts&nbsp; of tenancy with him and&nbsp; failed to comply with their obligations under Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1199, and that they were "working damage to the&nbsp; interest of the respondent without any legal justification and *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * proved themselves * * * unworthy&nbsp; to be retained further as tenants * * *&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent".&nbsp; Premised&nbsp; upon&nbsp; these allegations,&nbsp; respondent prayed, among&nbsp; other things, that petitioners be ejected from the land in question, that their relationship as&nbsp; landholder and tenants be terminated and that a liquidation of accounts be ordered.<br><br>In their, answer&nbsp; to this "counterclaim", petitioners admitted paragraphs 1 and 4 thereof and&nbsp; denied paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 of the same.&nbsp; Having failed to specifically deny the allegations&nbsp; in&nbsp; the above-quoted&nbsp; paragraph 2 of&nbsp; the "counterclaim", the lower court held that the truth thereof was deemed admitted by the petitioners and&nbsp; that&nbsp; a judgment on the pleadings was, therefore, proper.&nbsp; Petitioners assail this conclusion upon the ground that, under Rule 11, section&nbsp; 1, of the Rules&nbsp; of Court, if the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; fails to make a&nbsp; "reply" in denial or in avoidance of any affirmative averment made&nbsp; in&nbsp; the defendant's "answer",&nbsp; all&nbsp; new matters alleged therein are deemed controverted, and that, consequently, the aforementioned allegation in paragraph 2 of respondent's "counterclaim" should be deemed denied.<br><br>Said provision of the&nbsp; Rules of Court refers,&nbsp; however, to new&nbsp; matters&nbsp; alleged or special&nbsp; defenses set up&nbsp; in&nbsp; the "answer" proper, in respect of which plaintiff or petitioner is entitled to "reply". It does not apply to the allegations in&nbsp; a "counterclaim", for the&nbsp; pleading that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; or petitioner may file&nbsp; in response thereto is legally known as "answer", not "reply".&nbsp; The provision applicable to counterclaims is found&nbsp; in Rule 10, Section 7, of the Rules of Court, which is to&nbsp; the effect that—<br><blockquote>"A counterclaim or cross-claim must <span style="font-style: italic;">be answered in accordance with Rule 9</span> within ten (10) days from service."&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>Hence, not having been specifically denied in petitioners'<br>"answer to counterclaim", the allegations in said paragraph 2 of respondent's counterclaim&nbsp; are deemed admitted by the petitioners, pursuant to Rule 9, section 8, of said Rules of&nbsp; Court, which provides that—<br><blockquote>"Material averment in the complaint, other than&nbsp; those as to the amount of damage,&nbsp; shall be <span style="font-style: italic;">deemed admitted</span> when not&nbsp; specifically denied.&nbsp; Allegations of usury&nbsp; are deemed admitted if&nbsp; not denied specifically and under oath."&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>At any rate, the decision appealed from was rendered after <i>the introduction of evidence</i>, which was found by the lower court to have established the truth of the allegations in&nbsp; the counterclaim.&nbsp; Hence, said decision is not in the nature of a judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; may not be amiss to note that petitioners do not question the accuracy of the aforementioned finding.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioners.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
