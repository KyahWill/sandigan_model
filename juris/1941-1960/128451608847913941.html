				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On&nbsp; 6 February&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein respondent&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with the Public Service Commission an application to operate&nbsp; four&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) units for a TPU&nbsp; express&nbsp; through service&nbsp; between Cavite&nbsp; City to Olongapo,&nbsp;&nbsp; Zambales.&nbsp; via Manila,&nbsp;&nbsp; following a time table attached&nbsp; to the&nbsp; application,&nbsp;&nbsp; without&nbsp;&nbsp; picking&nbsp; up or dropping passengers&nbsp; in the City&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp;&nbsp; (case No.&nbsp; 70707).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The herein petitioner, joined&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Victory Liner,&nbsp;&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Try-V-Tran, filed&nbsp; their respective oppositions alleging&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; proposed service&nbsp; applied&nbsp; for by the&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; was&nbsp; unnecessary&nbsp; because their&nbsp;&nbsp; (the&nbsp; oppositors')&nbsp;&nbsp; actual service was&nbsp; adequate to&nbsp; meet&nbsp; the demands&nbsp; of the&nbsp; travelling&nbsp; public;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; proposed&nbsp; service would not&nbsp; promote public&nbsp;&nbsp; convenience&nbsp;&nbsp; but might&nbsp;&nbsp; result&nbsp;&nbsp; in a ruinous&nbsp;&nbsp; competition;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; should&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Commission find&nbsp;&nbsp; there was need&nbsp; for the&nbsp;&nbsp; service&nbsp; applied for they. the&nbsp; oppositors,&nbsp; were willing&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; put up&nbsp; additional service&nbsp; along the&nbsp; line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 11 June&nbsp;&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp;&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence of the applicant had been submitted it&nbsp;&nbsp; prayed that&nbsp;&nbsp; a provisional&nbsp; permit&nbsp; to operate the four (4)&nbsp;&nbsp; units&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; to&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; having&nbsp;&nbsp; been shown&nbsp; that&nbsp; no&nbsp; transportation on that&nbsp;&nbsp; line was being&nbsp;&nbsp; run by any public&nbsp;&nbsp; service. This petition was not acted upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; the hearing of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; case, however, Mariano Medina&nbsp; and the Try-V-Tran did not&nbsp; present&nbsp; any evidence;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead they filed their respective applications for authority to operate&nbsp; on the same cavite-Olongapo&nbsp; line via Manila Only&nbsp; the&nbsp; Victory Liner,&nbsp;&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; presented evidence. In support&nbsp; of its opposition.<br><br>After hearing,&nbsp;&nbsp; on 15&nbsp; October 1953&nbsp; the Public&nbsp; Service Commission rendered&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision granting&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; applicant&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; public&nbsp; convenience applied&nbsp; for,&nbsp;&nbsp; to run and&nbsp; operate daily&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; transportation of&nbsp; passengers and&nbsp; freight four&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) auto-trucks&nbsp; of&nbsp; any make,&nbsp;&nbsp; with fixed route regular termini and schedule&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; trips&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; line Cavite City-Olongapo&nbsp;&nbsp; (Zambales) via Highway 54,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; vice-versa.<br><br>Mariano Medina has&nbsp; petitioned for a review of the decision under Rule 43,&nbsp;&nbsp; contending that&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; Public Service Commission is not&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonably&nbsp; supported&nbsp; by the&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence of record;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Service Commission erred&nbsp; in not giving the&nbsp; petitioner the&nbsp;&nbsp; right&nbsp; of&nbsp; preference over&nbsp; that of the&nbsp; respondent in putting&nbsp; up the new service&nbsp; applied for.<br><br>On the&nbsp;&nbsp; first&nbsp;&nbsp; contention the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the Public Service Commission pertinent&nbsp;&nbsp; to it&nbsp;&nbsp; reads&nbsp; as follows;<br><br>From the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; adduced&nbsp; by applicant,&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears that&nbsp; there&nbsp; are many&nbsp; employees working&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Olongapo Naval&nbsp;&nbsp; Base who&nbsp; are residents of Cavite City who continued working, at&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Naval Base when&nbsp; it was&nbsp; transferred from Cavite&nbsp; to Olongapo;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; previous&nbsp; years,&nbsp;&nbsp; these employees from Cavite&nbsp; could&nbsp; avail&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; direct&nbsp; bus&nbsp; services&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Green Diamond,&nbsp;&nbsp; Osteria Transit and the&nbsp; Cavite Motor Bus&nbsp; Line,,&nbsp; but that&nbsp; these operators have already stopped&nbsp; operating from Cavite&nbsp; to Olongapo; that&nbsp;&nbsp; these&nbsp; employees go home to&nbsp; Cavite&nbsp; City not only on Friday&nbsp; afternoons,&nbsp;&nbsp; but, also&nbsp; on other days&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; week, because&nbsp; of&nbsp; overtime'' work or when they are given leaves of&nbsp; absence.;&nbsp;&nbsp; that at&nbsp;&nbsp; present&nbsp; there&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; direct service from Cavite&nbsp; City to Olongapo&nbsp; except&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; of Mariano Medina&nbsp; whose busses&nbsp;&nbsp; come&nbsp; from Silang.&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result&nbsp; of which said&nbsp; busses&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; already filled with&nbsp; passengers and&nbsp; cargoes when they&nbsp;&nbsp; pass Cavite&nbsp; City,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; passengers from' Cavite&nbsp; City&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp; to&nbsp; take&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; busses&nbsp; of&nbsp; applicant from Cavite City to&nbsp;&nbsp; its&nbsp;&nbsp; terminal in Manila&nbsp; at Florentino&nbsp; Torres&nbsp; Street;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; from this&nbsp; terminal,&nbsp;&nbsp; passengers have&nbsp; either to walk or&nbsp; take&nbsp; a taxi when they&nbsp; have packages with them,&nbsp;&nbsp; up to the&nbsp; Try-V-Tran&nbsp;&nbsp; station at&nbsp; Oroquieta,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; there are no&nbsp;&nbsp; jitneys&nbsp;&nbsp; operating&nbsp;&nbsp; between the two&nbsp; stations;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; system of transfer causes&nbsp; the passengers&nbsp; unnecessary&nbsp; delay and additional expenses in going&nbsp; from one&nbsp;&nbsp; station to&nbsp; another,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; difficulty of&nbsp; transportation&nbsp; is&nbsp; aggravated&nbsp; especially during rainy&nbsp; or stormy weather;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; during the time that the&nbsp; Green Diamond,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Osteria Transit&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Cavite Motor Bus Line&nbsp; were&nbsp; operating from Cavite&nbsp; City&nbsp; to&nbsp; Olongapo,&nbsp;&nbsp; a direct trip&nbsp; lasts abound&nbsp; four hours,&nbsp; whereas&nbsp; by riding&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; regular trips&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Saulog Transit from Cavite&nbsp; City&nbsp; to Manila,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Try-V-Tran or Victory Liner from Manila&nbsp; to Olongapo,&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; takes the&nbsp;&nbsp; passengers at&nbsp; least&nbsp; six hours.<br><br>On the&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Victory&nbsp;&nbsp; Liner&nbsp; tried to&nbsp; prove that&nbsp;&nbsp; the- present&nbsp; operators&nbsp; are&nbsp; rendering&nbsp; an&nbsp; adequate&nbsp; and sufficient&nbsp; service&nbsp;&nbsp; "or&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; needs&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; from Cavite&nbsp; City&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; Olongapo&nbsp;&nbsp; tint&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; previous operators&nbsp; operating&nbsp; on the&nbsp; line applied&nbsp; for were&nbsp;&nbsp; forced&nbsp; to abandon their&nbsp;&nbsp; service because&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; passengers obtaining&nbsp; online&nbsp;&nbsp; line;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; bulk of&nbsp;&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; is&nbsp; heavy only&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;on Fridays when the&nbsp;&nbsp; employees from the Naval&nbsp; Base go home&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; Cavite,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; on Sundays when the&nbsp;&nbsp; employees have&nbsp; to&nbsp; return&nbsp; to&nbsp; Olongapo&nbsp; to report for duty&nbsp; on Mondays that&nbsp;&nbsp; because the&nbsp;&nbsp; busses do not&nbsp;&nbsp; carry any&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; on Fridays&nbsp; on their way&nbsp; to&nbsp; Olongapo,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on Monday mornings from Olongapo&nbsp; to&nbsp; Cavite there were forced&nbsp; to&nbsp; pick local passengers from Manila&nbsp;&nbsp; along&nbsp; the way&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; Olongapo and vice-versa;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; even if&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; few passengers from Cavite to Olongapo have to drop at Manila,&nbsp;&nbsp; they have&nbsp; ready and available means of transportation either&nbsp; from the Victory Liner or from the. Try-V-Tian from Manila&nbsp;&nbsp; to Olongapo "where&nbsp; both operators maintain an hourly&nbsp; service.<br><blockquote>After&nbsp; a&nbsp; careful&nbsp;&nbsp; consideration of the&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by the&nbsp; parties,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Commission believes&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; there is&nbsp; really&nbsp; a need for&nbsp; authorizing&nbsp; the&nbsp; direct&nbsp;&nbsp; service applied for from Cavite City to Olongapo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; have&nbsp; consistently held that&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; direct&nbsp; service&nbsp; is more&nbsp; convenient&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; travelling&nbsp; public&nbsp; than one&nbsp;&nbsp; which&nbsp; Involves a transfer at some intermediate point, and&nbsp;&nbsp; this&nbsp; is&nbsp; true&nbsp; especially on long distance trips. In the&nbsp;&nbsp; present case,&nbsp;&nbsp; it has&nbsp;&nbsp; been proved that the difference in&nbsp; travelling&nbsp; time&nbsp; between the&nbsp; direct service and the one with&nbsp; transfer&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; two&nbsp; hours because the passengers have to&nbsp; avail&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves of&nbsp; the services of two operators, one&nbsp; from Cavite City to Manila and another&nbsp; from Manila Olongapo. Besides,&nbsp;&nbsp; the oppositor Victory Liner is&nbsp;&nbsp; serving only&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion of the&nbsp; line applied&nbsp; for and therefore cannot&nbsp; give&nbsp; the same&nbsp; service sought for in the&nbsp;&nbsp; present application. </blockquote>The above&nbsp; quoted&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision&nbsp; supported by&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; need of a direct&nbsp; line such as that&nbsp;&nbsp; applied for by the&nbsp; respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner filed Ms petition for&nbsp; a preferential&nbsp; right&nbsp; to operate over,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said line he&nbsp;&nbsp; emphasized&nbsp; in his&nbsp; application that&nbsp; public&nbsp;&nbsp; convenience demanded&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; operation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; direct service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The finding&nbsp; of the Commission as&nbsp; regards&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; difficulty&nbsp; of transfers,&nbsp;&nbsp; inconvenience,&nbsp;&nbsp; loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; time&nbsp; and&nbsp; efforts of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; passengers riding on the&nbsp; Saulog Transit and. Medina Transit busses and&nbsp; transferring to those of&nbsp; either the Try-V-Tran, or&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Victory Liner,&nbsp;&nbsp; Inc. from Cavite City&nbsp;&nbsp; to Manila&nbsp; at&nbsp; one point&nbsp;&nbsp; and from the&nbsp; latter city at&nbsp; another point&nbsp; to&nbsp; Olongapo,&nbsp;&nbsp; is supported&nbsp; by the&nbsp; evidence of record. Such&nbsp;&nbsp; being the&nbsp;&nbsp; case, the finding should not be disturbed, for it is a settled rule that this Court would not set aside a decision of the PublicService Commission as long as there is evidence that reasonably supports it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <br><br>On the point of preference, the same has already been settled when this Court held<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>The appellant insists that, as an old operator, it should enjoy preference in the matter of adding new auto-trucks required on the old and new lines. The appellant however, had not volunterred to apply for additional&nbsp; units&nbsp; and&nbsp; had. thought of&nbsp; claiming said&nbsp; right only after&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee,&nbsp;&nbsp; aware&nbsp; of the increasing&nbsp;&nbsp; travelling&nbsp; needs&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; people,&nbsp;&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an application for the&nbsp; issuance of the&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate in question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant's attitude is&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; both to the&nbsp; public and&nbsp; to other, operators.</blockquote>There&nbsp; is no doubt that&nbsp; the above ruling is applicable to the&nbsp; instant&nbsp;&nbsp; case,&nbsp;&nbsp; because&nbsp; it was only after the&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent had filed its application for&nbsp; a direct&nbsp; service line that the peti­tioner had awakened&nbsp; to tie&nbsp;&nbsp; realization that&nbsp;&nbsp; there was&nbsp; need for such&nbsp; direct service line&nbsp; aid&nbsp; filed his own application&nbsp; stressing the necessity for&nbsp; it&nbsp; which he&nbsp;&nbsp; in his&nbsp; written opposition to the respondent's application had&nbsp; previously denied.<br><br>The&nbsp; decision appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against<br>the&nbsp; petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., and <i>Endencia,</i> JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 35, Com.
