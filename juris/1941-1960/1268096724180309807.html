				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The appellant was found guilty of treason by the People's Court and sentenced 
to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, to pay a fine of P7,000, and costs.
<p>The findings of the People's Court are not assigned as errors or 
disputed.</p>
<p>The lower court found that one day in July or August, 1944, about two or 
three o'clock in the morning, a truck pulled up to the curb in front of a house 
on Constancia Street, Sampaloc, Manila, where one Martin Mateo lived. From the 
truck the accused, a Japanese spy, alighted together with members of the 
Japanese military police and pointed Martin Mateo's house and Fermin Javier's 
house to his Japanese companions, whereupon the Japanese soldiers broke into 
Martin Mateo's dwelling first and Fermin Javier's afterwards. In those houses 
they seized Martin Mateo, Ladislao Matco and Fermin Javier, bound their hands, 
and put them in the truck. Along with other persons who had been rounded up in 
other places and who had been kept in the truck while it was parked, they were 
taken to Fort Santiago where the two Mateos and Fermin Javier were tortured and 
from which they were released six days later. The reason for the arrest and 
maltreatment of Martin and Ladislao Mateo was that they had refused to divulge 
the whereabouts of their brother, Marcelino Mateo, who was a guerrilla and who 
had escaped from the Japanese. And Fermin Javier was arrested and tortured 
because he himself was a guerrilla, a fact which Carlos knew or at least 
suspected.</p>
<p>The defendant in this instance invokes only questions of law. He assigns four 
alleged errors, <i>viz</i>.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I. The lower court erred in not holding that the accused cannot be convicted 
of the offense of treason committed against the government of the United States 
and of the Philippines, because it is a settled principle in international law 
that in a territory 'actually under the authority of the enemy', all laws of 
political complexion of the previous government are suspended, and are without 
force and inasmuch as the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines defining and penalyzing the crime of treason are all of political 
complexion, they were suspended and had no binding effect whatsoever upon the 
inhabitants in the said occupied territories.</p>
<p>"II. The People's Court erred in not declaring the accused could not have 
violated the Philippine law on treason, because it is also a settled principle 
in international law that in such occupied territories all laws inconsistent 
with the occupation are being likewise suspended and without force and effect 
over the inhabitants, and since the laws of the United States and the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines defining and penalizing treason against the said 
government are by their very nature evidently inconsistent with the said 
occupation of the Philippines by the Imperial Japanese forces, the said laws 
must be deemed as having been suspended and without force and effect upon the 
Filipinos, during the said occupation.</p>
<p>"III. The People's Court erred in not holding that the accused herein cannot 
be convicted of the crime of treason committed against the government of the 
United States and of the Philippines, because it is a settled principle in 
international law that once the territory is so occupied by the enemy, the 
allegiance is as a legal obligation distinguishable and distinguished from 
loyalty of the inhabitants therein to the former government or governments is 
temporarily suspended, and it being necessary and essential for the commission 
of the offense of treason against the United States and the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines that the supposed offender should owe allegiance to said government 
at the time of the alleged offense, it follows that the accused cannot possibly 
be chargeable with treason against the United States and the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines for acts allegedly committed by him in the territory of the 
Philippines actually occupied by the Japanese during said occupation.</p>
<p>"IV. The decision rendered in this case should be reversed and set aside, 
because the law creating the People's Court is 
unconstitutional."</p></blockquote>
<p>The questions propounded in the first, second and third assignments of error 
were squarely raised and decided in the case of Laurel <i>vs</i>. Misa (77 
Phil., 856). That decision controls this appeal so far as the pleas of suspended 
allegiance and change of sovereignty are concerned. On the strength thereof, the 
first three assignments of error must be overruled.</p>
<p>The fourth assignment of error attacks the law creating the People's Court as 
unconstitutional. Numerous provisions of the People's Court Act are singled out 
as contrary to the Organic Law. But in formulating many of his propositions the 
appellant has not indicated the reasons or the authorities which sustain them. 
We shall dispose of them as briefly as they are presented. For better 
understanding, we shall reproduce the appellant's propositions and will comment 
on them separately.</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) It (People's Court Act) contains provisions which deal on matters 
entirely foreign to the subject matter expressed in its title, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) The first proviso of section 2 thereof, which retains the jurisdiction 
of the Court of First Instance to try and decide cases of crimes against 
national security committed during the second world war not filed within six 
months, notwithstanding the fact that according to its title, the People's Court 
is precisely created for that purpose, and impliedly, the People's Court 
jurisdiction in regard to said crimes is exclusive;</p>
<p>"(2) The second proviso of the same section which grants the People's Court 
jurisdiction to convict and sentence those accused therein even of crimes other 
than those against national security, although its title does not in any way 
indicate that such jurisdiction over other crimes would be granted to the said 
court;</p>
<p>"(3) Section 14 thereof, which adds to the disqualifications of Justices of 
the Supreme Court and provides a procedure for their substitution, a matter not 
indicated in any manner in its title;</p>
<p>"(4) The first proviso of section 19 thereof, which changes the existing 
Rules of Court on the subject of bail although its title speaks only of the 
creation of the People's Court and the Office of Special Prosecutors; and</p>
<p>"(5) The second proviso of the same section, which suspends the provisions of 
article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, a substantive law, which is not referred 
to in its title either expressly or by implication."</p></blockquote>
<p>The People's Court was intended to be a full and complete scheme with its own 
machinery for the indictment, trial and judgment of treason cases. The various 
provisos mentioned, in our opinion, are allied and germane to the subject matter 
and purposes of the People's Court Act; they are subordinate to its end. The 
multitude of matters which the legislation, by its nature, has to embrace would 
make mention of all of them in the title of the act cumbersome. It is not 
necessary, and the Congress is not expected, to make the title of an enactment a 
complete index of its contents. (Government of the Philippine Islands <i>vs</i>. 
Municipality of Binalonan, 32 Phil., 634.) The constitutional rule is satisfied 
if all parts of a law relate to the subject expressed in its title.</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) It deprives persons similarly situated of the equal protection of 
the laws inasmuch as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) Only those political offenders against whom cases are filed within six 
months from the passage of the law are to be tried in the People's Court, while 
others are to be tried in the Courts of First Instance;</p>
<p>"(2) Political offenders accused in the People's Court are denied preliminary 
examination and/or investigation whereas the others who may be accused of the 
same crimes in the Courts of First Instance shall be entitled thereto;</p>
<p>"(3) Political offenders accused in the People's Court have limited right to 
appeal, while those who may be accused of the same crimes in the Courts of First 
Instance have absolute right of appeal inasmuch as under section 13 of the law, 
Rules 42 and 46 of the Rules of Court are made applicable to the latter;</p>
<p>"(4) Appeals in the cases involving persons who held any office or position 
under either or both the Philippine Executive Commission and the Philippine 
Republic or any branch, instrumentality and/or agency thereof are to be heard 
and decided by a substantially different Supreme Court, thus causing lack of 
uniformity in rulings over the same subject;</p>
<p>"(5) The first proviso of section 19 thereof prescribes a different rule as 
to the granting of release on bail only with respect to the political offenders 
detained by the United States Army and released to the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines but not as to other political offenders accused or accusable of the 
same crimes; and</p>
<p>"(6) The second proviso of section 19 thereof suspends article 125 of the 
Revised Penal Code only as to those political detainees released by the United 
States Army to the Commonwealth of the Philippines or, at most, only to those 
accused or accusable of the crimes specified in the law and not as to all 
persons accused or accusable of crimes against national security committed 
during the second world war, much less to all offenders, notwithstanding the 
fact that there is no reasonable and real difference among said groups of 
offenders."</p></blockquote>
<p>(1) The People's Court is a court of special and restricted jurisdiction 
created under the stress of an emergency and national security. It was devised 
to operate for a limited period only, a limitation imposed by economic necessity 
and other factors of public policy. Obviously, the main concern in the creation 
of a special court was the trial and disposition of the cases, numbering over 
6,000, of accused who were being held by the United States military authorities 
and who were to be turned over to the Commonwealth Government. It was presumed 
that there were other cases of treason not included in this number—cases which 
might not be discovered until years afterward—, and the possibility was not 
overlooked that even some of the cases which the United States Army was on the 
eve of placing under the jurisdiction of the Philippine Government could not be 
filed and submitted for trial within a foreseeable future owing to lack of 
readily available evidence, absence of witnesses, or other causes. On the other 
hand, considerations of economy and public interests forbade maintenance of the 
People's Court for an indefinite period. Under the circumstances, it was 
necessary that a provision be made requiring that only cases which could be 
brought to court within six months and which were deemed enough to occupy the 
attention of the People's Court within the limited time of its life, should be 
cognizable by it, and the rest should be instituted in the proper Courts of 
First Instance. Such provision is not an arbitrary and intentional 
discrimination, and does not work as a deprivation of the right to equal 
protection of the laws. Both in privileges or advantages conferred, if any, and 
in liabilities imposed, if any, persons under equal circumstances are treated 
alike. It does not deprive appellant of the protection enjoyed by others falling 
within his class. The equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 
Constitution "does not prevent a state or municipality from adjusting its 
legislation to differences in situations and making a discrimination or 
distinction in its legislation in respect of things that are different, provided 
that the discrimination or distinction has a reasonable foundation or rational 
basis and is not palpably, purely, and entirely arbitrary in the legislative 
sense, that is, outside of the wide discretion which the legislative body may 
exercise." (16 C. J. S., 997.) Moreover, with its associate feature the People's 
Court is designed to extend greater protection to persons charged with 
collaboration with the enemy. If others are prosecuted before a Court of First 
Instance, they and not the appellant should have cause to complain of 
discrimination.</p>
<p>(2) Section 22 in denying preliminary investigation to persons accused before 
the People's Court is justified by the conditions prevailing when the law was 
enacted. In view of the great number of prisoners then under detention and the 
length of time and amount of labor that would be consumed if so many prisoners 
were allowed the right to have preliminary investigation, considered with the 
necessity of disposing of these cases at the earliest possible dates in the 
interest of the public and of the accused themselves, it was not an unwise 
measure which dispensed with such investigation in such cases. Preliminary 
investigation, it must be remembered, is not a fundamental right guaranteed by 
the Constitution. For the rest, the constitutional prohibition against 
discrimination among defendants placed in the same situation and condition is 
not infringed.</p>
<p>(3) For the same reasons stated before, this contention cannot be upheld. 
There is a rational basis for the distinction. The employment of two modes of 
appellate procedure in the two classes of cases involved are, in our opinion, 
suitably adapted to the differences, in their composition, between the courts 
from which the appeals are taken. The People's Court is a collegiate court 
whereas the Court of First Instance is presided over by a single judge. Appeal 
is not a constitutional but statutory right. The admitted fact that there is no 
discrimination among appeals from the same court or class of court saves the 
provision objected to from being unconstitutional.</p>
<p>(4) This objection does not seem to fall within the subject of constitutional 
guarantee against deprivation of equal protection of the laws. Be that as it 
may, we find no merit in the appellant's contention. The disqualification under 
the People's Court Act of some or a majority of the members of this Court and 
their substitution by justices of the Court of Appeals or judges of the Courts 
of First Instance do not make the Supreme Court, as thus constituted, a new 
court in the eyes of the law. A court is an entity possessing a personality 
separate and distinct from the men who compose or sit on it. This objection is 
no more valid than that of a party in an ordinary action who protests that his 
case is heard by a Supreme Court which, by reason of disability of a majority of 
its regular members, is made up mostly of judges from outside. As to the "lack 
of uniformity in rulings over the same subject," it need only be said that the 
Constitution does not insure uniformity of judicial decisions; neither does it 
assure immunity from judicial error.</p>
<p>(5) and (6) The two provisos in section 19 do not constitute denial of equal 
protection of the laws. The distinction made by these provisos between two sets 
of accused in the "granting or release on bail" and in the application of 
article 125 of the Revised Penal Code are not arbitrary or fanciful calculated 
to favor or prejudice one or the other class. This point was discussed at length 
and made clear in Laurel <i>vs</i>. Misa (76 Phil., 372), in which this Court 
explained the reasons which necessitated the extension to six months of the 
authorized detention of persons charged with treason before the filing of 
information. The provisos rest "on some real and substantial difference or 
distinction bearing a just and fair relation to the legislation." (16 C. J. S., 
998.)</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) It is a bill of attainder in that it virtually imposes upon 
specific, known and identified individuals or group of individuals, the penalty 
of detention and imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months without any 
form of judicial trial or procedure."</p>
<p>"The bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without 
judicial trial." (Cummings <i>vs</i>. Missouri, 4 Wall., 232, etc.) Detention of 
a prisoner for a period not exceeding six months pending investigation or trial 
is not a punishment but a necessary extension of the well recognized power to 
hold the criminal suspected for investigation. This proviso was held by this 
Court to be justified and reasonable under existing circumstances in Laurel 
<i>vs</i>. Misa, <i>supra</i>.</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>d</i>) Section 2 thereof which purports to define the jurisdiction of 
the People's Court constitutes an invalid and void delegation of legislative 
power which is vested exclusively in the Congress of the Philippines by the 
Constitution, in so far as said section virtually leaves unqualifiedly in the 
discretion of the Solicitor General and/or the Office of Special Prosecutors the 
power to determine the actual cases over which the People's Court shall have 
jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Granting the correctness of the premise of this proposition, it does not 
follow that the authority vested in the Solicitor General amounts to a 
delegation of legislative power. We do not think that power to institute certain 
cases in one court or another in the discretion of the prosecuting attorney is 
an exercise of legislative power. "The true distinction is between the 
delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily involves a discretion as 
to what it shall be, and conferring authority or discretion as to its execution, 
to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot be done; to 
the latter no valid objection can be made." (Cincinnati, V. &amp; Z. R. Co. 
<i>vs</i>. Clinton County Comr's [1852], 1 Ohio St., 77, cited in Tañada on the 
Constitution of the Philippines, p. 291.)</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>e</i>) Sections 1, 4 and 18 thereof abridge, limit and curtail the power 
of appointment of the President or the Chief Executive in that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) Section 1 practically leaves the President with such a very small field 
of choice in the appointment of the members of the court that he can hardly use 
his discretion in regard thereto; and</p>
<p>"(4) Sections 4 and 18 actually designate and appoint the persons who will 
occupy the positions left vacant by those appointed to the People's Court and 
the Office of Special Prosecutors respectively."</p></blockquote>
<p>The power to create offices and courts is vested in the legislative 
department. Subject to constitutional restrictions, the Congress may determine 
on the eligibility and qualification of officers and provide the method for 
filling them. We find no valid objection on constitutional ground to a law which 
directs that a special temporary court should be filled by appointment by the 
Chief Executive himself from among judges already on the bench and/or other 
quasi-judicial officers. As to outsiders who might have to be appointed by 
reason of insufficiency of qualified men already in the service, the Chief 
Executive is left with a wide field of choice.</p>
<p>The theory that "sections 4 and 18 actually designate and appoint the persons 
who will occupy the positions left vacant by those appointed to the People's 
Court and the Office of Special Prosecutors respectively" loses sight of the 
fact that the positions referred to are, as a matter of fact, vacant only in 
theory, and for the duration of the People's Court, and that the law does no 
more than say that after those judges and officers shall have accomplished their 
work, they shall go back to their permanent posts.</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>f</i>) The said law provides for the designation and/or transfer of 
judges appointed for particular districts to another place outside of their 
respective districts without the consent of the Supreme Court."</p>
<p>Section 7 of Article VIII of the Constitution provides that "no judge 
appointed for a particular district shall be designated or transferred to 
another district without the approval of the Supreme Court. The Congress shall 
by law determine the residence of judges of the inferior courts." This 
constitutional provision, as its language clearly states, refers to transfers 
from one judicial district to another. It does not prohibit the appointment or 
designation of a judge of the Court of First Instance or any other judge from 
being appointed temporarily or permanently with his consent to a court of 
different grade and make-up, such as the People's Court.</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>g</i>) Sections 13 and 19 thereof prescribed rules of procedure 
regarding appeal and bail which violate the rule of uniformity of rules for all 
courts of the same grade established in the Constitution."</p>
<p>It is the rules promulgated by the Supreme Court which are required by 
section 13 of Article VIII of the Constitution to be uniform for all courts of 
the same grade. The People's Court is not a court of the same grade, considering 
many of its special features, and its purposes, as the Court of First Instance 
or any other existing court in the Philippines, so that the adoption of special 
rules of procedure for said court different from those applicable to Courts of 
First Instance is not violative of this constitutional mandate. More than this, 
the last sentence of the section expressly authorizes the Congress "to repeal, 
alter, or supplement the rules concerning pleading, practice, and procedure, and 
the admission to the practice of law in the Philippines."</p>
<p>The brief says:</p>
<p>"(<i>h</i>) It is destructive of the independence of the judiciary and 
thereby violates the constitutional provision that the Philippines is a 
republican state because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) By creating a special court with jurisdiction over cases which were 
already within the jurisdiction of the existing Courts of First Instance without 
any real necessity and urgent justification, considering that the persons 
involved in said cases were more or less known and identified at the time of the 
creation of said special court, the law establishes a precedent under which the 
legislature may at any time remove from the jurisdiction of existing courts 
cases involving definite or specific individuals or groups of individuals to 
serve any purpose which said legislature or the legislators composing the same 
may wish to accomplish, either to the benefit or damage of said individuals or 
groups of individuals;</p>
<p>"(2) By limiting the choice of the judges to compose the People's Court to 
those who did not hold any position in the Philippine Executive Commission 
and/or the so-called Republic of the Philippines, the law makes a classification 
that has absolutely no rational basis inasmuch as the reason for discriminating 
against those who served in said governments, which is, that they might be 
prejudiced or influenced in favor of the accused exists in equal measure for 
those who did not serve, in the sense that they may likewise be prejudiced or 
influenced against the accused; and</p>
<p>"(3) In leaving practically in the hands of the Solicitor General the 
absolute right to choose, in which court he shall prosecute the cases 
contemplated by the law, and in providing that the judges of the People's Court 
shall be chosen from a limited group of the judges of the Court of First 
Instance, etc., the law does not leave a wide room for the play of external 
factors in the administration of justice to those concerned but also destroys 
the confidence of the people in the judiciary."</p></blockquote>
<p>(1 and 2) These objections go to the wisdom of the law and to matters of 
policy. This1 being so, it is enough that the Congress deemed it necessary to 
incorporate these provisions in Commonwealth Act No. 682. It is not the province 
of the courts to supervise legislation and keep it within the bounds of 
propriety and common sense. That is primarily and exclusively a legislative 
concern. (Rubi <i>vs</i>. Provincial Board of Mindoro, 39 Phil., 661.)</p>
<p>(3) This proposition is covered by and answered in our comment on paragraph 
(<i>d</i>) of the brief.</p>
<p>The judgment of the lower court is affirmed with costs against the 
appellant.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Hilado, Bengzon,</i> and <i>Briones, JJ.,</i>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The appeal in this case raises only questions of law. Of the four assignments 
of error made in appellant's brief, the first three are premised on the theory 
of suspended allegiance, and the last is premised on the theory that the law 
creating the People's Court is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The question of suspended allegiance was already rejected by a majority of 
this court in the case of Laurel <i>vs</i>. Misa, in a resolution dated January 
30, 1947 (77 Phil., 856), and our reasons for voting for the rejection are 
expressed in our written opinion in said case.</p>
<p>We do not see in appellant's brief any argument which may justify the 
changing of our opinion in the Laurel case where, by the way, the question of 
suspended allegiance appears to have been discussed, perhaps, thoroughly and 
exhaustibly.</p>
<p>Regarding the fourth assignment of error, appellant advances the following 
proposition: "The People's Court Law (Commonwealth Act No. 682) is 
unconstitutional and void in many parts and as a whole because:</p>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) It contains provisions which deal on matters entirely foreign to 
the subject matter expressed in its title;</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) It deprives persons similarly situated of the equal protection of 
the laws;</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) It is a bill of attainder in that it virtually imposes upon 
specific, known, and identified individuals or group of individuals, the penalty 
of detention and imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months without any 
form of judicial trial or procedure;</p>
<p>"(<i>d</i>) Section 2 thereof constitutes an invalid and void delegation of 
legislative power, in so far as it virtually leaves unqualifiedly in the 
discretion of the Solicitor General and/or the Office of Special Prosecutors the 
power to determine the actual case over which the People's Court shall have 
jurisdiction;</p>
<p>"(<i>e</i>) Sections 1, 4, and 18 thereof abridge, limit and curtail the 
power of appointment of the President;</p>
<p>"(<i>f</i>) It provides for the designation and/or transfer of judges 
appointed for particular districts to another place outside of their respective 
districts without the consent of the Supreme Court;</p>
<p>"(<i>g</i>) Sections 13 and 19 thereof prescribed rules of procedure 
regarding appeal and bail which violate the rule of uniformity of rules for all 
courts of the same grade established in the Constitution;</p>
<p>"(<i>h</i>) It is destructive of the independence of the judiciary and 
thereby violates the constitutional provision that the Philippines is a 
republican state;</p>
<p>"(<i>i</i>) Section 14 providing for disqualification of some Justices of the 
Supreme Court is unreasonable in its operation."</p>
<p>Although it is regrettable that appellant failed to elaborate on the several 
grounds upon which he impugns the validity of the law in question, upon which 
theory he seeks reversal of the decision of the People's Court and his acquittal 
from the treason charge, such failure does not relieve us from the duty of 
passing upon the questions raised, much more because they are not of passing 
importance. Our opinion on the several grounds relied upon by appellant to 
attack the validity of Commonwealth Act No. 682 is as follows:</p>
<p align="center">(<i>a</i>) MULTIPLICITY OF SUBJECT MATTER</p>
<p>On the first ground, appellant undoubtedly relies on the following provision 
of the Constitution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject 
which shall be expressed in the title of the bill." (Section 21 [1], Article 
VI.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Five reasons are advanced by appellant to show that the act violates the 
constitutional prohibition against multiplicity of subject matter. We are going 
to deal with them separately.</p>
<p>(1) It is alleged that, although the People's Court has been created 
precisely to try crimes against national security with jurisdiction impliedly 
exclusive, section 2 thereof retains the jurisdiction of courts of first 
instance to try and decide cases not filed within six months. We do not believe 
that the provision violates the constitutional inhibition. There should not be 
any question that the creation of the People's Court was an answer to an unusual 
situation, created by the extraordinary social upheaval provoked by the last 
war, demanding an uncommon solution, compatible with the tenets of our 
democracy, with the provision of the Constitution, and with the noble aims of 
justice. The several thousands of persons detained upon liberation charged with 
treason and other crimes against national security, needed the creation of a 
judicial machinery for the prompt disposal of their cases so as not to violate 
their constitutional right to a speedy trial. It was admitted that the inferior 
courts then existing were not enough to cope with the situation. Those who are 
guilty, should be sentenced as soon as possible, so they may expiate for the 
wrongs that they have committed, and those who are innocent are entitled to be 
cleared without any delay. The People's Court was, therefore, created to 
shoulder the burden that the courts of first instance could not bear. Congress 
estimated that six months was enough time for the cases of the thousands of 
detainees to be filed with the People's Court, while the cases of those who have 
not yet been detained, on the assumption that they will be few, there was no 
reason why these should not be disposed of by the courts of first instance as is 
declared in the proviso of section 2. The proviso is germane with the subject 
matter of the law and does not violate the prohibition against multiplicity of 
subject matter.</p>
<p>(2) The second objection is raised against the proviso authorizing the 
People's Court to convict and sentence those accused for any crime included in 
the acts alleged in the information and established by the evidence, although 
they are not classified as among those committed against national security. The 
objection cannot be entertained. The proviso is within the logical purview of 
the creation of the People's Court. The lawmaker must have had in mind the fact 
that among the thousands of detainees which motivated the creation of the court 
there were persons who had committed crimes other than those against national 
security.</p>
<p>Although these are the crimes primarily in the minds of those who arrested 
said detainees, there is nothing unnatural that those who committed said crimes 
may have also committed offenses of different nature either in connection with 
the first ones or independently, and if said other offenses are included among 
the facts alleged in the information filed with the People's Court and proved by 
the evidence, there is no reason why said court should not punish them as a 
court of first instance would, it appearing that the People's Court is but a 
special court of first instance.</p>
<p>(3) The third objection points to the disqualification of certain Justices of 
the Supreme Court and the procedure of their substitution as provided in section 
14 of Commonwealth Act No. 682. Although said section is, in effect, null and 
void as unconstitutional, it is not enough ground to hold the whole act as 
unconstitutional, as said section can be eliminated without affecting the 
remaining provisions of the act.</p>
<p>(4) The fourth objection points to the proviso of section 19, which provides 
for an exception concerning political offenders in the existing rules of court 
on the subject of bail. Whether the proviso is valid or not, it cannot affect 
the constitutionality of the whole act. If it is valid, it is within the purview 
of the creation of the People's Court. If it is invalid, it can be discarded 
without affecting the other provisions of the law.</p>
<p>(5) The fifth objection points to the second proviso of section 19, 
suspending the provisions of article 125 of the Revised Penal Code. The proviso 
is evidently unconstitutional. It is not within the purview of the creation of 
the People's Court. It creates a discrimination violative of the constitutional 
guarantee of the equal protection of the laws. In effect, it authorizes 
deprivation of liberty of the political prisoners for a period of six months, 
which is violative of the constitutional guarantee that no person shall be 
deprived of his liberty without due process of law. But the proviso may be 
eliminated without affecting the remaining portions of the act and, therefore, 
is not enough ground for declaring the whole act null and void.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that the first ground attacking the validity of the law is 
without merit.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>b</i>) EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS</p>
<p>Appellant advances six reasons to show that the act violates the 
constitutional guarantee of the equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p>(1) The first reason is that, under section 2, the People's Court is only to 
try the cases of political offenders against whom the information has been filed 
within six months, while others shall be tried in a Court of First Instance. We 
believe that there is no unjust discrimination in it. Those who will be tried by 
courts of first instance cannot complain of any unjust discrimination. They will 
be tried by the regular tribunals created to try all other offenses. Those who 
are to be tried by the People's Court cannot complain either, because said court 
is but another court of first instance, although especially created for the 
prompt disposal of the cases of political detainees. Congress made it collegiate 
as a guarantee against possible miscarriage of justice due to popular excitement 
during the first months after the liberation. Congress believed that a 
three-person tribunal can defend itself better against any outside pressure than 
a one-man tribunal.</p>
<p>(2) The second reason is that political offenders accused in the People's 
Court are denied the preliminary investigation accorded to those who may be 
accused in the court of first instance. We are of opinion that the allegation is 
groundless. There is nothing in the act in question depriving political 
offenders accused in the People's Court of the preliminary investigation as 
provided by Rule 108.</p>
<p>(3) The third reason is that political offenders accused in the People's 
Court have limited right to appeal, while those who may be accused of the same 
crime in a court of first instance have absolute right to appeal. The allegation 
is partly true. There appears a discrimination against those who may be 
convicted by the People's Court <i>in banc</i>, by providing that they can only 
appeal in accordance with Rule 46, under which only questions of law may be 
raised. We are of opinion that the discrimination is violative of the guarantee 
of the equal protection of the laws, and should not be given effect. But the 
unconstitutional provision may be eliminated, without annulling the whole act. 
In practice, the invalid discriminating provision seems to have become obsolete 
as all cases in the People's Court are tried and decided in division and not 
<i>in banc</i>.</p>
<p>(4) The fourth reason is that appeals in cases involving persons who held any 
office under the governments established by the Japanese during the occupation 
are to be heard and decided by a substantially different Supreme Court. The 
allegation is correct by virtue of the provisions of section 14 which is 
flagrantly unconstitutional because (<i>a</i>) the disqualification of some 
members of the Supreme Court provided therein constitutes in effect partial 
removal from office in open violation of the guarantees and procedure provided 
by Article IX of the Constitution, (<i>b</i>) it provides for sitting in the 
Supreme Court of persons not appointed in accordance with section 5 of Article 
VIII of the Constitution and without the qualifications provided in section 6 of 
the same article, and (<i>c</i>) it provides for the existence of a second 
Supreme Court in violation of section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution 
which provides for only "one Supreme Court." But, as we have already stated, 
section 14 can be eliminated from Commonwealth Act No. 682, without declaring 
the act wholly unconstitutional.</p>
<p>(5) The fifth reason is that there is discrimination in the first proviso of 
section 19 as to the granting of release on bail. We are of opinion that there 
is no substantial discrimination.</p>
<p>(6) The sixth reason is the discrimination provided in the second proviso of 
section 19. The proviso is null and void, but it can be eliminated without 
annulling the whole act. It is a denial of the equal protection of the laws and 
is violative of the constitutional guarantee against deprivation of liberty 
without due process of law. The proviso should not be given effect, without 
annulling the whole act.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>c</i>) BILL OF ATTAINDER</p>
<p>Appellant alleges that Commonwealth Act No. 682 is a bill of attainder in 
that it virtually imposes upon specific, known and identified individuals or 
group of individuals, the penalty of detention and imprisonment for a period not 
exceeding six months without any form of judicial trial or procedure.</p>
<p>The allegation is justified by the second proviso of section 19 of the act. 
But it cannot affect it in whole as said proviso can be eliminated without 
impairing the remaining proviso of the law.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>d</i>) DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER</p>
<p>Appellant alleges that section 2 constitutes an invalid and void delegation 
of legislative power in so far as it virtually leaves unqualifiedly in the 
discretion of the Solicitor General and/or the Office of Special Prosecutors the 
power to determine the actual cases over which the People's Court shall have 
jurisdiction. There is no such delegation. The People's Court is substantially 
but one court of first instance, only with limited jurisdiction. Whether a case 
is to be tried by the People's Court or by an ordinary court of first instance, 
there is no substantial difference for purposes of the administration of justice 
and the jurisdictions of both courts are specifically provided in the law.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>e</i>) CURTAILMENT OF THE POWER OF APPOINTMENT OF THE 
PRESIDENT</p>
<p>Appellant's objection is directed against sections 1, 4, and 18. The 
objection is untenable. Congress may validly provide for the qualifications of 
the members of the People's Court. Section 8 of Article VIII of the Constitution 
expressly grants that authority.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>f</i>) TRANSFER OF JUDGES WITHOUT APPROVAL OF THE SUPREME 
COURT</p>
<p>Appellant alleges that Commonwealth Act No. 682 provides for the designation 
and/or transfer of judges to another place outside of their respective districts 
without the consent of the Supreme Court, implying that section 7 of Article 
VIII of the Constitution is violated. The allegation is untenable. The fact that 
the act authorizes the appointment of persons already holding positions in the 
judiciary to be members of the People's Court is no violation of the 
constitutional mandate. What the authors of the Constitution contemplated were 
transfers from one district to another, but not appointment of those already 
holding positions to other positions.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>g</i>) UNIFORMITY OF LAWS</p>
<p>The objections of appellant in paragraph (<i>g</i>) is but a repetition of 
his objections in paragraph (<i>b</i>) already dealt with above.</p>
<p align="center">(<i>h</i>) INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY</p>
<p>Appellant sets the following propositions:</p>
<ol><li>By creating a special court with jurisdiction over cases which were already 
within the jurisdiction of the existing courts of first instance, considering 
that the persons involved in said cases were more or less known and identified 
at the time of the creation of said court, the law establishes a precedent under 
which Congress may at any time remove from the jurisdiction of existing court 
cases involving definite or specific individuals or groups of individuals to 
serve any purpose which the members of Congress may wish to accomplish, either 
to the benefit or damage of said individuals. 

<p></p></li><li>By limiting the choice of the judges to compose the People's Court, the law 
makes a classification that has absolutely no rational basis.<p></p> </li><li>In leaving to the hands of the Solicitor General the absolute right to 
choose in which court he shall prosecute the cases contemplated by the law and 
in providing that the judges of the People's Court shall be chosen from a 
limited groups of individuals, etc., the law does not leave a wide room for the 
play of external factors in the administration of justice to those concerned but 
also destroys the confidence of the people in the judiciary. </li></ol>The 
questions raised in the above three propositions are serious but none of them 
amounts to a violation of the fundamental law that may nullify the law in 
question, as they involve a matter of public policy, although the first one 
points to a situation bordering into a transgression of the guarantee of the 
equal protection of the laws. If the provisions of the law creating the special 
court should show a clear purpose of making a discrimination, pro or against 
those who may be tried under it, then the law must be declared null and void 
<i>in toto</i>. Such is not the case of the law under discussion. Matters of 
public policy not involving a violation of the fundamental law are within the 
province of Congress to legislate, subject only to the control of the people 
through the electorate. 
<p>For all the foregoing, we vote to affirm the decision rendered by the lower 
court in this case.</p></div>
