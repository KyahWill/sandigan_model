				<H3>FRANCISCO DE BORJA AS EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED JOSEFA TANGCO, PETITIONER, VS. BIENVENIDO A. TAN, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, AND JOSE DE BORJA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for mandamus to compel respondent Judge Bienvenido A. Tan 
to approve and admit the record on appeal filed before him and to give due 
course to the appeal. The facts involved as gathered from the record may be 
briefly stated as follows. On October 25, 1940, petitioner Francisco de Borja 
filed a petition in the lower court for the probate of the Last Will and 
Testament of his deceased wife Josef a Tangco. The will was probated on April 2, 
1941, and named Francisco de Borja as executor thereof. One of the heirs who is 
now one of the respondents herein Jose de Borja appealed the case to the Court 
of Appeals but later his motion for dismissal of the appeal was granted. All the 
records of the case were destroyed or lost during the last Pacific war but were 
on January 1, 1946, reconstituted. On March 26 of that year Francisco de Borja 
qualified as executor and administrator.
<p>Due to the physical inability of Francisco de Borja to fully administer the 
estate he being quite weak and unable to see, on August 25, 1951, on petition of 
Matilde de Borja, one of the heirs, the lower court appointed Crisanto de Borja, 
another heir, as co-administrator, Crisanto qualified as co-administrator on 
August 29, 1951.</p>
<p>On April 9, 1952, the trial court according to petitioner, without petition 
of or notice to anyone appointed respondent Jose de Borja as co-administrator, 
this, after holding in abeyance consideration of Francisco de Borja's amended 
account dated March 25, 1952. Francisco, Matilde and Crisanto moved for 
reconsideration of the appointment of Jose de Borja but by order of August 14, 
1952, respondent Judge indirectly denied the motion for reconsideration, and 
acting upon an alleged <em>ex-parte</em> petition of the heirs Jose, Crisanto, 
Cayetano and Matilde, all surnamed De Borja, revoked the appointment of Crisanto 
as co-administrator and directed administrator Jose de Borja to comment on the 
amended account filed by Francisco de Borja. </p>
<p>On July 22, 1952, Francisco, Matilde and Crisanto filed a notice of appeal 
from the order appointing Jose de Borja as co-administrator and the order 
denying the motion for reconsideration and later they filed the corresponding 
record on appeal. By order of December 27, 1952, respondent Judge Tan 
disapproved the record on appeal and refused to give due course to the appeal on 
the ground that the appointment of Jose de Borja as co-administrator was 
interlocutory in nature and so was not appealable. Hence, this petition for 
mandamus, as already stated, to compel respondent Judge to approve the record on 
appeal and to give due course to the appeal.</p>
<p>An order appointing a regular administrator is appealable (See Sy Hong Eng 
<em>vs</em>. Sy Liac Suy, 8 Phil., 594). On the other hand, according to Rule 
105, section 1(<em>e</em>) an order appointing a special administrator is not 
appealable. Respondents contend that a co-administrator is not a regular or 
general administrator, and his duties and functions rather partake those of a 
special administrator; consequently, his appointment is not subject to appeal. 
We cannot share this view. The powers and functions of a special administrator 
are quite limited. Under Rule 81, section 1, a special administrator is 
appointed only when there is a delay in granting letters testamentary or of 
administration occasioned by an appeal from allowance or disallowance of a will 
or from any other cause, and such special administrator is authorized to collect 
and take charge of the estate until the questions causing the delay are decided 
and an executor or administrator thereon appointed. Under Rule 87, section 8, a 
special administrator is also appointed when the regular executor or 
administrator has a claim against the estate he represents and said special 
administrator shall have the same power and subject to the same liability as a 
regular executor or administrator. In other words, a special administrator is 
appointed only for a limited time and for a specific purpose. Naturally, because 
of the temporary and special character of his appointment, it was deemed by the 
law not advisable for any party to appeal from said temporary appointment. On 
the other hand, a co-administrator performs all the functions and duties and 
exercises all the powers of a regular administrator, only that he is not alone 
in the administration. Further taking into consideration the circumstances 
obtaining in this case, that petitioner Francisco de Borja though originally 
designated administrator, is and has for several years been one only in name due 
to his physical and mental disability, as a result of which respondent Jose de 
Borja is now practically the sole administrator, there is no question that for 
all practical and legal purposes the appointment of Jose de Borja as 
co-administrator is equivalent to and has the same effect as a sole regular or 
general administrator.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, holding that the appointment of a co-administrator, 
especially in the present case, is appealable, the petition for mandamus is 
granted and respondent Judge is hereby directed to approve the record on appeal 
and to give due course to the appeal. No costs.</p>
