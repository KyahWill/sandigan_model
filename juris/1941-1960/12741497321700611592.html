				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is the appeal of A.L. Ammen Transportation Co, (Alatco for short) from 
the decision of the Public Service Commission granting Francisco Desuyo's 
request for a new certificate of public convenience to continue operating<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> his TPU autotruck service along the lines 
Bacon-Bulan via Boton (all in Sorsogon province) and Bacon-Tiwi (Sorsogon and 
Albay provinces).<p></p>
<p>The first route covering a distance of 73 kilometers passes through Sorsogon 
(municipality) Casiguran, Juban and Irosin, in that order. The second covers 110 
kilometers passing through Sorsogon, Guinlajong, Castilla, Putico, Daraga, 
Legaspi, Libog, Manlilipot, Tabaco and Malinao.</p>
<p>The grant was issued after regular hearing upon proper application, despite 
Alatco's opposition. </p>
<p>According to the Commission, petitioner's evidence showed that "numerous 
merchants, farmers, employees, students and other travelers made trips on the 
line applied for; that quite frequently TPU vehicles serving these lines were 
either full or overloaded with passengers and many other travelers along the 
road could not readily be accommodated in passing TPU vehicles."</p>
<p>The above findings rested on the testimony of Jose Dacog, a lumber dealer of 
Sorsogon, who had frequently travelled along the Sorsogon-Bulan or the 
Bacon-Bulan roads, and of Jose Bansale, a resident of Tabaco, who was engaged in 
buying and selling fish, and had to journey along the Legaspi-Tiwi routes, and 
who had also travelled often to Sorsogon.</p>
<p>They also rested on the sworn statements of Francisco Desuyo who spoke of his 
trips from Sorsogon to Legaspi as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q.- On the road from Sorsogon to Legaspi, what passenger cars do you see 
along the road?"</p>
<p>"A. - Many of them: Alatco, Nicol, Soriano, Margallo and other operators, 
operating pick ups"</p>
<p>" x x x x."</p>
<p>"A.- I always observe that these cars coming from Legaspi which I meet on 
the way are filled with passengers, some of them being overloaded. It is because 
the barrios along the way from Legaspi to Sorsogon are very thickly populated, 
and there are always plenty of passengers in these barrios along the 
way."</p></blockquote>
<p>In line with our policy of non-interference with the findings of the 
Commission where some evidence reasonably supports its findings as to necessity 
and convenience of the authorized public utility, we must decline in this appeal 
to overrule the Commission determination. Specially is this so where Alatco's 
very witness, Rufino Soler, in the words of the Commission, "admitted that the 
services of the oppositor and other TFU operators in that region are not 
adequate to meet the demand of travelers on the lines applied for, because they 
do not operate direct or continuous trips on these lines," unlike the applicant 
in this case. The aforesaid witness deposed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. -Are these operators, other than Desuyo, able to meet the demand of the 
riding public along the lines from Bacon to Bulan and vice versa and from Bacon 
to Tiwi via Legaspi and vice versa?"</p>
<p>"A. - No."</p>
<p>"Q.- What do you mean by your answer no?"</p>
<p>"A.-Because there are no operators operating directly from Bacon to Legaspi 
and Bacon to Bulan."</p></blockquote>
<p>And there is no question that Alatco does not undertake direct trips from 
Bacon to Bulan, nor from Bacon to Tiwi via Legaspi, its lines being those of 
Sorsogon-Bacon, Sorsogon-Bulan, Sorsogon-Legaspi, Legaspi-Tabaco and 
Tabaco-Tiwi.</p>
<p>No argument is needed to show that one long continuous trip serves the 
traveler's convenience better than several short trips, what with the 
elimination of the cumbersome and expensive transfers from one bus to another at 
the terminals of the connecting lines.</p>
<p>On the business aspect of the matter, the Commission must have thought, 
properly indeed, that if after five years' service the petitioner, still in good 
financial position, wished to continue and the Alatco exhibited no adverse 
effects from his competing activities, there must have been no ruinous 
competition in that area, with sufficient room for the simultaneous operation of 
both transportation services - for the benefit, naturally, of those who may need 
accommodation for themselves and/or their merchandise. Needless to add, "public 
convenience must have the first consideration," (San Miguel Brewery v. Lapid, 53 
Phil. 539.)</p>
<p>There being no clear error nor abuse of discretion in the appealed decision, 
the same is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioner. So ordered. </p>
