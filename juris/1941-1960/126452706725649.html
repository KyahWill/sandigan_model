				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On  April  27, 1945, Juan Navarro and Anacleto Atienza, acting provincial governor and  provincial warden, respectively, of the Province  of Mindoro, were charged with the arbitrary  detention of Esteban  P.  Beloncio (in criminal case No. 32) and of Juan G.  Beloncio II  (in criminal case No. 33).  Typical  was the first information  alleging:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That from  January 27, 1945, and for several days thereafter, In the municipality of  Calapan, Province of Mindoro, Commonwealth of the  Philippines,  and within the  jurisdiction of this  Honorable Court,  the  said defendants Juan  Navarro and Anacleto Atienza, Acting: Provincial  Governor and  Provincial  Warden,  respectively, both being  public officials  to whom  the custody and  responsibility of prisoners were entrusted for proper action,  without  any  lawful or justifiable  cause and without  legal grounds therefor, did then and there  wilfully,  unlawfully and  feloniously  detain Esteban  V. Beloncio in the Provincial Jail of  Mindoro which  continued for more than fifteen days but less than six months."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April  28, 1945, the Judge of the Court of First Instance  called the cases  for trial.  The  record is not completely clear as to what transpired therein.  It is apparent that a  pre-trial was held,  the  Judge asking the parties or their attorneys some questions, which the latter answered, with the result that admissions were made to the  effect that  Esteban P. Beloncio and Juan G.  Beloncio II had been detained for several  days after January 27, 1945, in the provincial jail of Mindoro by order of the Commanding General, Western Visayan Task Force, United States Army. Whereupon, defendants' counsel lost no  time in filing  a motion to quash, upon  the ground  that the facts charged did  not constitute a criminal  offense.  Ruling  upon  the motion, the Honorable M.  L. de la  Rosa,  Judge,  dismissed the two cases, explaining in part:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  *  *  Argumentando  ambas partes, la  defensa en favor de su morion de sobreseimiento,  de esta fecha, y la  acusacidn, oponiendose a  la misma, convienen en que los  referidos Esteban P. Beloncio y Juan G. Beloncio II  fueron  detenidos y puestos en la carcel, conio presos,  por las autoridades militares de las fuerzas Americanas, despues de la  reconquista de esta parte norte de Mindoro, que tuvo  lugar hacia la segunda  mitad de enero  ultimo, las cuales autoridades fueron tambien quienes mas  tarde nombraron  a Juan Navarro, corno Gobernador Provincial de esta provincia,  puesto que hasta  ahora lo  ocupa, porque  aun  no se  ha nombrado,  por los funciortarios del Commonwealth de Pilipinas, su sucesor,  y fue instruido a  continuar  ejerciendo  su cargo."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The provincial fiscal appealed.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General argues that "if the informations must be quashed on the ground 'that the facts charged do not constitute an offense' elementary logic dictates that the facts charged 'in the informations1' must be the one examined and analyzed to determine the sufficiency of the allegations."  He also maintains that it was error for the court to make findings of fact and decide the criminal  cases on the merits, before issue  had been joined, and before any evidence had  been properly  presented.</p>
<p>The defense thoroughly  answered these points.</p>
<p>The office of the Solicitor General does not deny that the</p>
<p>Beloncios had been committed to jail by order of competent authorities of the American forces of liberation.  The record fails to show any motion  for  reconsideration by the provincial fiscal disputing the admissions attributed to him in the court's decision.  Hence we are justified, in assuming,  that such  representations had  been made.  Consequently when the defense  urged that the facts charged did not constitute an offense,  invoking not only the allegations of the information but also the admissions  made by the fiscal, the trial judge rightly sustained the motion.  Because the Beloncios had been placed  by competent authority of the United States military forces in the official custody of defendants, who were public officials entrusted with the detention of prisoners,  they could not very well  be turned loose without a countermand.   The fiscal should  have mentioned other subsequent circumstances, if any, establishing defendants' duty (which  they  failed to fulfill)  to release the Beloncios.</p>
<p>It must be noted that the section of the rule (sec. 2 [<em>a</em>], Rule 113) permitting  a motion to quash on the ground that "the facts charged do not constitute an offense"  omits reference to the facts detailed "in the information."  Other sections of the  same rule would imply that the issue is restricted to those alleged in the information (<em>see</em> sees. 9 and  10, Rule 113). <em>Prima facie</em>, the "facts  charged" are those described in the complaint, but they may be amplified or qualified by others appearing to be additional circumstances, upon admissions made by the peop'e's representative, which admissions could anyway be submitted by him as amendments to the same information.  It would  seem to be pure technicality to hold that in the  consideration of the motion  the parties and  the judge were precluded from considering facts which  the fiscal  admitted  to be true, simply because  they were not described in the complaint.  Of course, it  may be added that upon similar motions the court and the fiscal are not required to go beyond the averments of the information, nor is the  latter to be inveigled into a premature and risky revelation of his evidence.  But we see no reason to prohibit the fiscal from making, in all candor, admissions of undeniable facts, because the principle can never be sufEcient'y reiterated that such official's role is to see that justice is done: not that all accused  are convicted, but that the  guilty are justly punished.  Less reason can there be to  prohibit the court from considering those admissions, and deciding accordingly, in the interest of a speedy administration of justice.</p>
<p>The Beloncios were thus deprived of their liberty by order of the military authorities, a few days after the liberation of Mindoro.  Judicial notice may be taken of the fact, that upon military occupation and before the establishment of the normal processes of civil government the liberties and rights of citizens are likely to suffer temporary restrictions1, what with the exigencies of military strategy, or the confusion usually resulting from the situation.  While the infringement of constitutional precepts and  privileges is not to be tolerated, war necessities  and consequences cannot be overlooked.  At any rate, no reasons' are shown why the irregularity, if any, committed by others, should be visited upon defendants-appellees.  The acts imputed to them, as herein recorded,  do not,  of  themselves, constitute a punishable offense.  The appealed decision is affirmed.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras, Jaranilla,  Feria, De Joya, Pablo, Hilado</em>, and <em>Briones,  JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.,  </strong></p>
<p>We concur.  To attain the substantial  ends of  justice, procedural technicalities must be dispensed with, and  the court rules must be interpreted so as to give them the resiliency demanded by the circumstances of the case. Court rules must give way to judicial liberalism and legal progress.   The law embodied  in them must grow and develop. Even the calcareous shells of the large phylum of mollusks, notwithstanding their rocky hardness and  apparent fixity; grow in answer to the evolutionary requirements of biological laws.</p>
<p>Prosecution's statements belong to a  class  of evidence of the highest order in behalf of the accused.  It is  based. on the same principle upon which estoppel is established, and from which the ad hominem argument in logic derives its force.</p>
