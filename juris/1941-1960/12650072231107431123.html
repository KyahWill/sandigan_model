				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Atlas&nbsp; Trade&nbsp; Development&nbsp; Corporation brought&nbsp; this action to recover the price of 200 tons of Australian frozen beef which&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; supply&nbsp; for shipment to Japan upon orders of defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; The record discloses that on July 8,&nbsp; 1948 William J. Herman wrote a letter to Ted Lewin, Atlas Trade Development Corporation, ordering 200 tons of Australian&nbsp; frozen beef in quarters to be shipped during&nbsp; July,&nbsp; August and September to Yokohama, Japan upon its orders (Exhibits F).&nbsp; The order is written on a letterhead&nbsp; of "William&nbsp; International&nbsp; Inc.", San Francisco and&nbsp; signed by Herman as president of said corporation.&nbsp; The defendant, however, is "F" Limgenco Co. Ltd." formed by William J. Herman, an American citizen, and Francisco Limgenco, a Filipino,&nbsp; a partnership&nbsp; doing business under the name of "William International Ltd." (Articles of Partnership, Exhibit A.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The first defense is that the defendant did not place the order, but that it was the corporation Williams&nbsp; International Inc. that did so, that William J. Herman had no&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; enter into the contract&nbsp; in the name of the partnership, and that the manager&nbsp; F. Limgenco&nbsp; never&nbsp; ratified&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; order.&nbsp; The second defense is that the contract was signed by Herman only as accommodation for Ted Lewin, to enable the latter to secure an extension&nbsp; of credit, and that said&nbsp; contract was not intended as one between plaintiff and&nbsp; the partnership F. Limgenco, Ltd., that the first shipment was made by Herman&nbsp; for Ted Lewin&nbsp; and paid for to Ted&nbsp; Lewin, and the last shipments were unfit for human consumption. The&nbsp; third defense is that&nbsp; even granting&nbsp; that defendant corporation&nbsp; is bound by the contract it is only liable for the shipment actually made, not for&nbsp; all.<p>It appears that on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1947 plaintiff, on&nbsp; one hand, and Ted Lewin and Paul Macdonald,&nbsp; on the other, formed a joint&nbsp; account association&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose of importing livestock from Australia, to be slaughtered&nbsp; and sold&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; The beef was stored in&nbsp; a local ice plant.&nbsp; The negotiations leading&nbsp; to the contract were made by Ted Lewin on the one hand and William J. Herman, representing defendant William&nbsp; International Ltd,, on the other.&nbsp; Trial shipment was&nbsp; made to Japan on May 17, 1948 (Exhibit N.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The contract was signed on July 8, 1948.&nbsp; When&nbsp; this&nbsp; shipment was found&nbsp; satisfactory, another shipment for 33,926.27&nbsp; lbs. was made in the name of defendant as shipper on July 14, 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bills of lading showed defendant as shipper.&nbsp; No payment for the shipment was ever made.</p><p>The complaint was filed on November 26, 1948, and in the complaint it announced&nbsp; that it would sell the frozen meat and whatever may be realized after deducting the expenses, would&nbsp; be&nbsp; deducted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the claim.&nbsp; Since the filing&nbsp; of the complaint the&nbsp; beef&nbsp; has been sold, the sales appearing in the statement submitted as Annex A. </p><p>The trial&nbsp; court found&nbsp; that&nbsp; notwithstanding the&nbsp; fact that Exhibit F was&nbsp; written on a&nbsp; letterhead of Williams International, Inc. the order was&nbsp; in fact placed&nbsp; by defendant; that the order was not made for the accommodation, of Ted Lewin; that it was not a commission agency; and&nbsp; that there was&nbsp; no evidence to&nbsp; show that&nbsp; the meat was not fit for human consumption, and even if it were so, plaintiff was not&nbsp; aware thereof and&nbsp; defendant did&nbsp; not make such claim within 30 days as provided&nbsp; for in Article 342&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Commerce.&nbsp; It,&nbsp; therefore, ordered Francisco Limgenco and William J. Herman jointly and severally to&nbsp; pay P172,289.21,&nbsp; with&nbsp; legal interest&nbsp; from November 26, 1948, plus 5 percent as attorney's fees, while Ted Lewin&nbsp; and Paul&nbsp; Macdonald&nbsp; were held subsidiarily liable for the amount of the judgment.</p><p>On this appeal defendant corporation insists that the transaction was one between William J. Herman and Ted Lewin in their personal capacities,&nbsp; and that plaintiff and defendant were not actual parties thereto.&nbsp; While it seems to be true that neither&nbsp; Santiago Abraham, president of the plaintiff corporation, nor Francisco Limgenco, manager of the defendant partnership,&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; have much to do in&nbsp; the formulation&nbsp; of the agreement, Exhibit F, such that defendant's assertion that the transaction was pushed through&nbsp; by Herman and Lewin is&nbsp; justified, it does not necessarily follow that Herman and Lewin entered into the&nbsp; transaction in their own&nbsp; personal capacities&nbsp; independently of the associations to which they belong.&nbsp; The fact that they&nbsp; may have&nbsp; conducted the negotiation&nbsp; is not incompatible with the theory&nbsp; on&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; action is based, i.e., that&nbsp; the transaction was between the corporation and the partnership.&nbsp; As a matter&nbsp; of fact&nbsp; in order to engage in the business of importing livestock from Australia for slaughter in the city&nbsp; abbatoir and deposit of the beef in a local cold store, Ted Lewin and Paul Macdonald, on the one&nbsp; hand, had&nbsp; made the joint account on August 4,&nbsp; 1947 with the plaintiff corporation. On the other hand, as William J.&nbsp; Herman, a San Francisco resident, could not do the business with Ted&nbsp; Lewin or his partners in the&nbsp; joint account without a representative in the Philippines, he entered into&nbsp; the partnership agreement in May, 1948, with Francisco Limgenco.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the joint account between Lewin and Macdonald,&nbsp; on the one hand, and the Atlas Trade Development Corporation on the other, Lewin and Macdonald contributed quite a considerable amount (P300,000) to the livestock and beef business, while in&nbsp; the partnership (F. Limgenco, Ltd.) between&nbsp; Herman and Limgenco, the former&nbsp; contributed P40,000 against F20,000 only from the latter.&nbsp; So that the main contributors to the&nbsp; transaction were Ted Lewin and Paul MacDonald, on the one hand, and&nbsp; William J. Herman, on the other.&nbsp; These circumstances point out to the fact that Lewin and&nbsp; Herman, assuming that&nbsp; they were the ones who negotiated the agreement, chose to act in relation thereto through&nbsp; their respective companies, not independently thereof.&nbsp; In legal contemplation&nbsp; also and by subsequent acts of the parties, the whole transaction involved&nbsp; not Lewin and Herman personally, but the Atlas Trade&nbsp; Development Corporation, of which Ted Lewin&nbsp; was an important member, and&nbsp; Williams International Ltd., to which&nbsp; Herman&nbsp; contributed&nbsp; two thirds&nbsp; of the&nbsp; capital. That the meat deal was&nbsp; to&nbsp; bind both associations,&nbsp; not; Lewin&nbsp; and 'Herman personally, is demonstrated by&nbsp; the further fact that the bills of lading covering beef actually ordered from plaintiff by defendant partnership&nbsp; were in the name and for the account of Williams International Ltd.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Exhibit&nbsp; N,&nbsp; N-l&nbsp; and N-2.)&nbsp; We, therefore, find no error in the conclusion&nbsp; of the trial court that the contract was in fact made in the name and&nbsp; through the plaintiff corporation and the defendant partnership and is binding upon both of them and not upon their members alone.</p><p>As to the claim made before the trial court that William J. Herman executed the agreement only&nbsp; for&nbsp; the accommodation of Ted Lewin, we find no sufficient&nbsp; evidence on record to support the claim,&nbsp; and the appellant seems to have abandoned&nbsp; its theory&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has&nbsp; also abandoned its theory that&nbsp; the contract is one of agency on&nbsp; commission basis, it&nbsp; appearing from the contract that the beef was being purchased&nbsp; at $.50 a pound f.o.b. Manila.</p><p>The next&nbsp; point&nbsp; raised&nbsp; before&nbsp; us by the&nbsp; defendant-appellant is that it should&nbsp; not be held responsible for the value of the whole amount of beef ordered, which is&nbsp; 200 tons, because the same was unfit for human consumption. We find no sufficient evidence&nbsp; to&nbsp; sustain the claim&nbsp; of defendant-appellant that the meat&nbsp; was&nbsp; unfit for human consumption.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; we find that it was not acceptable to the prospective or intended buyers or customers in Japan, as shown by Exhibits 8 and 9.&nbsp; It must be remembered&nbsp; that&nbsp; the meat was&nbsp; to be sold for the exclusive use of the&nbsp; United States occupation personnel in Japan (Exhibit 12.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The meat could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be sold in Japan because&nbsp; it was found below the&nbsp; standard quality&nbsp; desired. Plaintiff-appellee refutes&nbsp; this fact with the argument that the meat was actually sold in the&nbsp; market in the Philippines.&nbsp; The mere sale of the meat in the Philippines is no satisfactory proof, however, that it was&nbsp; acceptable to the United States occupation&nbsp; personnel&nbsp; stationed&nbsp; in Japan. We find as&nbsp; a fact that the reason why the meat ordered was not taken by the defendant is&nbsp; because the&nbsp; same was not saleable in Japan where it was intended to be disposed of.&nbsp; The question that&nbsp; arises, therefore,&nbsp; is, who should bear&nbsp; the loss, the vendor or the vendee.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court held that it was the vendee because no notice of the unfitness of the meat was given to the vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we find sufficient&nbsp; evidence to show&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; corporation, through its president,&nbsp; was advised&nbsp; of the fact that the quality of the meat was not satisfactory of the intended purchasers&nbsp; in Japan.&nbsp; The trial court based its decision, holding the defendant partnership responsible for the meat, on the provisions of Article 342&nbsp; of the Code of Gommerce, which is as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The purchaser who has not&nbsp; made&nbsp; any claim based on the hidden defects (vicio internos) of the thing sold, within thirty days after its delivery, shall&nbsp; lose all rights of action against the vendor based on such&nbsp; defects."</p></blockquote><p>It can readily&nbsp; be seen from the above Article that it&nbsp; is applicable to goods or merchandise&nbsp; already delivered and in which deterioration was&nbsp; caused by the failure or default of a vendee to take&nbsp; possession&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreed time. Such is not the situation in the case at bar.&nbsp; Here there never was&nbsp; any delivery.&nbsp; Neither does it&nbsp; appear that the vendee&nbsp; was guilty of mora&nbsp; in&nbsp; taking possession&nbsp; of the meat contracted for.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the&nbsp; meat was deposited in a cold storage, delay in&nbsp; not taking possession of&nbsp; it&nbsp; would&nbsp; not affect its quality&nbsp; or&nbsp; its fitness&nbsp; for human&nbsp; consumption. It has not also been claimed that&nbsp; the deterioration of the meat was due to the failure of appellant to take&nbsp; possession. The evident fact&nbsp; is that the appellant did&nbsp; not take the meat because&nbsp; the&nbsp; samples thereof sold&nbsp; in&nbsp; Japan were not found satisfactory or&nbsp; acceptable to those who would have wanted to purchase them. Under these circumstances, the provision applicable&nbsp; is not Article&nbsp; 342 but Article 334 of the&nbsp; Code of Commerce, which reads:</p><p>"The&nbsp; damages&nbsp; and deterioration&nbsp; suffered&nbsp; by the&nbsp; merchandise, even if caused by fortuitous event, shall be&nbsp; for the account of the vendor in the following cases:&nbsp; </p><ol><li>If the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; took place&nbsp; by&nbsp; number, weight,&nbsp; or measure,&nbsp; or if the article sold is not fixed&nbsp; and determined,&nbsp; with marks and&nbsp; signs which identify it.&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>If by express agreement or the&nbsp; usages of commerce, in view of the nature of&nbsp; the article sold, the purchaser has the&nbsp; privilege to previously examine and investigate it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>If the contract&nbsp; contains an agreement&nbsp; to the effect&nbsp; that the delivery&nbsp; shall not be made until the article sold shall have acquired the conditions stipulated."</li></ol><p>In accordance with the second paragraph&nbsp; of this Article, the vendor&nbsp; is&nbsp; responsible&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; deterioration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the quality&nbsp; of the meat if it appears to have been caused by a fortuitous&nbsp; event or to unexplained&nbsp; causes.&nbsp;&nbsp; As there is no&nbsp; evidence as&nbsp; to&nbsp; what&nbsp; caused the deterioration,&nbsp; we&nbsp; can only attribute it to nothing but a fortuitous event.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the meat was&nbsp; perfectly sound&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time the livestock was slaughtered, the deterioration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the meat must have been due to&nbsp; the&nbsp; handling thereof by&nbsp; the vendor or&nbsp; its&nbsp; agents, so that&nbsp; any loss resulting therefrom may not be imputable to the vendee.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these circumstances, in&nbsp; accordance with the Article above quoted, it&nbsp; is the vendor who should bear the loss&nbsp; for its deterioration.&nbsp; Because of the deterioration the vendee&nbsp; was justified in not&nbsp; making1 further orders for the delivery of the meat.&nbsp;&nbsp; This holds true with the undelivered meat. However, as to the meat which was actually delivered, we hold'&nbsp; that the defendant-appellant must be made to account for its price, which according to plaintiff's own&nbsp; complaint is&nbsp; P38,427.&nbsp; We also find&nbsp; that the&nbsp; claim of the defendant-appellant that part of&nbsp; this amount was paid to Ted Lewin is&nbsp; not supported by the evidence.</p><p>The judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is hereby modified.&nbsp; Defendants are&nbsp; absolved from all the demands contained in the&nbsp; prayer of&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; complaint except&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P38,427, which they are hereby ordered to&nbsp; pay to&nbsp; the plaintiff, with legal interest from the time of the filing of the complaint.&nbsp; However, defendants Ted Lewin and Paul Macdonald&nbsp; are hereby&nbsp; declared only subsidiarily liable to plaintiff for said amount, they having acted as&nbsp; guarantors for defendant Williams International Ltd.&nbsp; Without costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
