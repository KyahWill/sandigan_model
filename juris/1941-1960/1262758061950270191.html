				G.R. No. L-2092, April 06, 1948</h4>
				<H3>JUSTO CAMAT, PETITIONER, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISON, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Camat was committed to the new Bilibid Prisons on June 30, 1944, 
to suffer six years' imprisonment, to pay a fine of P1 ,000 or suffer one year's 
subsidiary imprisonment, imposed upon him by the Court of Special and Exclusive 
Criminal Jurisdiction, for illegal possession of firearms. Petitioner alleges 
that he was sentenced as a guerrilla. On February 5, 1945, he was released from 
confinement by virtue of a mass conditional pardon issued by the Japanese 
detachment commander for the new Bilibid Prisons. On February 20, 1947, he was 
arrested, charged with robbery, and committed as a detention prisoner to the new 
Bilibid Prisons on February 25, 1947. 
<p>A year later, on February 25, 1948, upon the theory that the pardon granted 
to petitioner on February 5, 1945, was null and vold, the Director of Prisons 
transferred his status as a detention prisoner to that of a convict.</p>
<p>Petitioner complains that the action of the Director of Prisons is illegal 
and that, as a result, petitioner has been restrained of his liberty to talk and 
receive his visitors once a week, confined to cells of convicted criminals, and 
made to wear prisoner's garb and work like an ordinary criminal, all of which 
are not and cannot be done to a detention prisoner who has the presumption of 
innocence In his favor, and that the transfer has been made in bad faith and 
with full knowledge that It is illegal because, while respondent took official 
notice of the majority decision of the Supreme Court that the pardon granted to 
petitioner is null and void, he refused to take cognizance of the decision of 
the Supreme Court in Peralta <em>vs</em>. Director of Prisons, L-49, November 
12, 1945, 42 Off. Gaz., 198, declaring that the crime of illegal possession of 
firearms during the occupation is a political crime and that the decision of the 
Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal jurisdiction ceased to be good and valid 
<em>ipso facto</em> upon the liberation of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Petitioner prays that the Director of Prisons be ordered to Immediately 
restore petitioner to his status as a detention prisoner, that the judgment of 
the Court of Special and Exelusive jurisdiction be declared null and void, and 
that respondent be ordered prosecuted for the illegal transfer of petitioner 
from detention to convicted prisoner.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General, in behalf of respondent Director of Prisons, 
recommended in his return of March 23, 1948. that petitioner Camat be restored 
to his former status as a detention prisoner, upon the nullity of his conviction 
for illegal possession of firearms during the occupation by the Court of Special 
and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction, in accordance with the decision in the 
Peralta case.</p>
<p>As prayed for, the Director of Prisons is ordered to immediately restore 
petitioner Justo Camat, also known by the names of Jose or Josefino in the 
pleadings on record, to his former status as a detention prisoner, his 
conviction by the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction for 
illegal possession of firearm having become null am void.</p>
<p>Petitioner's prayer that the Director of Prisons be prosecuted for the 
allegedly illegal transfer he made maybe filed by petitioner with the 
corresponding administrative or prosecuting officers, no action by this Court on 
the matter being necessary,</p>
<p><em>Par√°s, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and <em>Padilla, JJ.,</em> concur.
