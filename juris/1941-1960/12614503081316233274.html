				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
dismissing plaintiff-appellant's action for compensation for injuries received 
by him while working as a laborer in defendant's lumber yard. The appeal was 
made to the Court of Appeals, but in view of the fact that only questions of law 
are raised it was certified to us.
<p>Plaintiff-appellant suffered injuries in the middle finger of his right hand 
while stacking lumber in the lumber yard of the defendant. As a member of a 
group of laborers doing that job for the defendant company, he was not employed 
directly by the company, but worked under a contractor by the name of Pablo 
Manansala who, in representation of the group of laborers, contracted the 
stacking of lumber in the lumber yard at P4.00 per thousand board feet, 
collected the price of the stacking and distributed it among the laborers. 
Manansala and his group did not work for the defendant alone; they also did 
similar work for other lumber yards. Defendant company was not also obliged to 
employ Pablo Manansala and his group everytime that it had lumber to be stacked 
up, but could call other contractors or groups of laborers. The defense of the 
defendant, which was sustained by the court <em>a quo</em>, is that 
plaintiff-appellant was a purely casual laborer, employed by what is known in 
law as an independent contractor, Pablo Manansala, who had direction and control 
of plaintiff-appellant without interference on the part of the defendant. Said 
the court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ademas de lo arriba expuesto, la demandada niega en absoluto tener relacion 
contractual con dicho demandante, ni relacion directa eon el mismo, pues nunca 
ha empleado al demandante en los trabajos de la compania, porque esta ha entrado 
en contrato dbn Pablo Manansala bajo ciertas consideraciones, pero nunca convino 
con el demandante. sobre los trabajos aqui en cuestion. En una palabra, la 
demandada nunca ha tenido autoridad ni control sobre el demandante, ni sobre sus 
trabajos, porque estos fueron contratados bajo el sistema de <em>pakiaw</em>, or 
por <em>board feet</em>, entre la parte demandada y el contratista Pablo 
Manansala, y este a su vez utilizo a los obreros que el necesitaba bajo su 
responsabilidad y control, no habiendo nunca estos obreros sido contratados como 
trabajadores de la demandada. El demandante tiene el caracter de trabajador 
casual y depende de el el trabajar o no trabajar."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Workmen's Compensation Act, under which plaintiff-appellant's action is 
based, provides that when an employee suffers personal injury from any accident 
arising out of and in the course of his employment * * * his employer shall pay 
compensation * * *." (Sec. 2, Act No. 3428 as amended by Rep. Act No. 772.) The 
same law gives the following definition of a laborer or employee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'Laborer' is used as a synonym of 'Employee' and means every person who has 
entered the employment of, or works under a service or apprenticeship contract 
for an employer. It does not include a person whose employment is <em>purely 
casual and is not for the purposes of the occupation or business of the 
employer</em>. Any reference to the person dependent on him, as defined in this 
Act, if the context so requires, or, if the employee is a minor or 
incapacitated, to his guardian or nearest of kin." (Sec. 39 [<em>b</em>], Act 
No. 3428 as amended by Rep. Act No. 772.)</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no question in our mind that the court <em>a quo</em> gave an 
erroneous interpretation to the terms "independent contractor" and "purely 
casual" as used in the law on compensation. An independent contractor has been 
defined as one who exercises independent employment and contracts to do a piece 
of work according to his own methods and without being subject to control of his 
employer except as to the result of the work. (Andoyo <em>vs</em>. Manila 
Railroad Co., G. R. No. 34722, cited in Francisco, Labor Laws, p. 817.) Some 
circumstances taken into account to determine whether a person is an independent 
contractor are: whether he has capital or money of his own to pay his laborers; 
whether he filed a bond to answer for the fulfillment of his contract with his 
employer. In the case at bar, the mere fact that Pablo Manansala had no capital 
or money of his own to pay plaintiff, and does not appear to have filed a bond 
to answer for his contract with the defendant, does not necessarily prove that 
he is not an independent contractor. (<em>Id</em>.) Neither does the fact that 
the payment for the work is to be made by piece (work), <em>pakiao</em>, make 
Pablo Manansala an independent contractor. This also is not determinative of the 
liability or non-liability of the employer for the physical injuries received by 
the laborer. (Linaaw and Salome <em>vs</em>. The Mountain Province, G. R. No. 
40093, April 24, 1934; Montalban <em>vs</em>. Tan Soon, G. R. No. 4804, July 24, 
1942; cited in Francisco, Labor Laws, pp. 818; 820.)</p>
<p>As to the finding of the court that the employment of the plaintiff-appellant 
was merely casual, because it was not continuous, we have already had occasion 
to decide that it is not the continuity of employment that renders the employer 
responsible, but whether the work of the laborer is part of the business or 
occupation of the employer. In the case of Calupitan <em>vs</em>. Vda. e Hijos 
de Angel Jose (40 Off. Gaz. [11th Sup.], p. 31 cited in appellant's brief, p. 
12), the deceased laborer was hired only for one trip, yet we held that the work 
was not purely casual because the trip, was undertaken in two or three times a 
year for the accommodation of the defendant's customers and may be regarded as 
part of the employer's activities.</p>
<p>It will be noted that in order that an employer may not be responsible for an 
injury to a laborer it is necessary that the "<em>employment is purely casual 
and is not for the purposes of the occupation or business of the employer</em>." 
<em>Casual</em> means occasional, coming without regularity. The work is purely 
casual when it is not a part of the business in which the employer is engaged. 
The clause "is not for the purposes of the occupation or business of the 
employer" complements and explains the term "purely casual". In a sawmill, for 
example, if a power unit running the mill gets out of order and a mechanic is 
contracted to fix the engine, the work of the mechanic would be considered as 
purely casual, because the reparation of the mill isjiot the actual work or 
business of the sawmill but the sawing of lumber. But the piling up of lumber is 
work directly connected with the business of a lumber yard. Lumber must be 
sorted and piled up in groups according to sizes to facilitate handling and 
sale. The piling up of lumber is, therefore, an ordinary part of the Work in a 
lumber yard.</p>
<p>The case at bar is similar or parallel to that of stevedores unloading cargo 
from a ship. The fact that the stevedores work under the control of a 
contractor, who pays them. and that they may seek other work under different 
carriers, and their work covers a very short period of time as to each carrier, 
does not exempt the carrier who had employed them in the unloading of the cargo 
from paying compensation for death or injuries received by them because the 
unloading of the cargo is an ordinary part of a carrier's duty. To this effect 
is our decision in the case of Flores <em>vs</em>. Cia. Maritima, 57 Phil. 905, 
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is not the least shadow of doubt that the deceased was a laborer in 
the legal sense. He had been recruited by order of the captain of the ship and 
he was engaged in the task of unloading the ship's cargo at the time of the 
accident. There can be no dispute that this kind of work is included in the 
business in which the appellee is engaged. That the deceased had been recruited 
or engaged by a contractor is of no moment because the latter, for purposes of 
the law, was an agent or representative of the ship's captain who, in turn, 
represented the appellee."</p></blockquote>
<p>The foregoing considerations clearly demonstrate that the trial court erred 
in holding that the plaintiff-appellant's employment was purely casual and not 
for the purposes of the business of the defendant company and the judgment in 
relation thereto must be reversed.</p>
<p>Under Section 14 of Act No. 3428, the plaintiff is entitled to receive 60 per 
cent of his average weekly wages for the period he was incapacitated for labor, 
exclusive of the first seven days. As his average weekly wage is P36.00, he is 
entitled to compensation amounting to P321.43. The judgment appealed from is 
hereby reversed and the defendant-appellee is hereby ordered to pay 
plaintiff-appellant the sum of P321.43, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
