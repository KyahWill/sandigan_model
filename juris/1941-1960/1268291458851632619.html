				G.R. No. L-2766, August 25, 1949</h4>
				<H3>PABLO ROBATON Y PASTRANA, PETITIONER, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> For stealing personal property from a private party, petitioner 
was, on November 23, 1943, convicted of theft by the Court of First Instance of 
Manila and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from 6 months of <i>arresto 
mayor</i> to 1 year, 8 months and 21 days of <i>prision correccional</i>. Though 
he commenced to serve this sentence on the following day, petitioner later 
evaded it by escaping from prison on March 16, 1944. He was, however, recaptured 
and turned over to the Bureau of Prisons on May 22, 1948.
<p align="justify">Petitioner now asks for a writ of habeas corpus, contending 
that the sentence rendered against him during the Japanese occupation is ho 
longer valid, invoking in support of this contention the decision of this Court 
in Peralta vs. Director of Prisons, 42 Off. Gaz., 198 and a proclamation of 
General MacArthur nullifying certain acts of the Government during said 
occupation.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is without merit. Petitioner was sentenced for 
committing an act penalized by the territorial law (the Revised Penal Code) as a 
crime against the legitimate government. The crime had no political complexion. 
It was "one that would have been punished any time, anywhere." Petitioner was 
convicted of that crime by one of the regular courts. Under our ruling in such 
cases, the sentence, though rendered during the enemy occupation, did not become 
invalid thereafter. (Guinto vs. Director of Prisons, 45 Off. Gaz., 2890<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, Landicho vs. Superintendent G. R. No. 
L-1498; Montebon vs. Director of Prisons, 44 Off. Gaz., p. 3312<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>.)</p>
<p align="justify">The decision in Peralta vs. The Director of Prisons has no 
application here, because there the accused was convicted of an offense which 
had political complexion, an offense taken out of the territorial law and placed 
under the punitive sanction of an Ordinance promulgated by the puppet government 
for the protection of the army of occupation.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition for habeas corpus is therefore denied, without 
special pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, 
Tuason,</i> and <i>Montemayor, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
