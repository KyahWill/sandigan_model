				G.R. No. L-836, March 30, 1950</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ANACLETO MAGDANG, JOSE CADUNGON AND AMPARO SUMUGAT, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In December, 1942, the defendants-appellees were charged with malicious 
mischief in the justice of the peace court of Culasi, Antique. The complaint 
alleged that they had plowed land planted with mongo thereby damaging the owner 
in the sum of fifteen pesos. They asserted the right to cultivate the land. 
Found guilty by the justice of the peace, they appealed to the court of first 
instance.
<p>There the trial was postponed several times. On March 10, 1944, the case was 
called for hearing. The provincial fiscal was absent. Counsel for defendants 
moved for dismissal. Whereupon the judge made this order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The record of this case shows that the information filed by the Acting 
Provincial Fiscal is dated October 25, 1943, and that the original complaint in 
the court below was filed on December 31, 1942. This case, therefore , has been 
pending in court for quite a long period of time, and the hearing of this case 
has been postponed a number of times. The Acting Provincial Fiscal has failed to 
appear in court this morning without any reason, but the accused have signified 
their readiness to have an immediate trial of the case. Their counsel verbally 
moved for the dismissal of the case, for the reason that they have come to the 
court a number of times, and that the case should be heard with the least 
possible delay. Finding their motion justified, the case is hereby dismissed, 
with costs <em>de oficio</em>."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fiscal filed a notice of appeal on March 20, 1944.</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General contends in this Court that the order should be 
revoked, because it does not appear that the provincial fiscal had been 
officially notified of the actual date of hearing.</p>
<p>The records of the case now before us demonstrate how incomplete and informal 
the proceedings wereâ€”obviously due to the emergency caused by the war. We find 
therein that the Fiscal never asserted in writing that he had not been notified. 
On the other hand the judge says that said officer "failed to appear in court 
this morning without any reason" which fairly implies that the Fiscal had been 
notified, notice being a fundamental requirement which must be presumed to have 
been complied with.</p>
<p>In situations similar to the one asserted here by the prosecution, the Fiscal 
or the party affected should first make representations in the court below (in a 
motion for reconsideration or new trial) as to the alleged non-receipt of 
notice, so that the trial judge may have an opportunity to make an official 
statement on the point or see to it that the records are completed. </p>
<p>Considering that the question involves a petty offense possibly mixed up with 
a civil litigation, we see no justification in letting it clutter court records 
for a long time, especially in the absence of a clear case.</p>
<p>The order of dismissal is affirmed. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Padilla, Tuason</em>, and <em>Reyes, 
JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p>BENGZON, J.:</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Montemayor voted to affirm. </p></div>
