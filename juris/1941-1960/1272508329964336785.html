Gaz., No. 4, 1571, involving other detectives of the police department of&nbsp; the City of Cebu also summarily&nbsp; dismissed by the then mayor Vicente del Rosario&nbsp; in 1953, and subsequent cases involving the same issue (Olegario <em>vs.</em> Lacson, 97 Phil., 75; Quintos <em>vs.</em> Lacson,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 51&nbsp; Off.
