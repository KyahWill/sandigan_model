				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Initiated in the Manila court of first instance, this is a suit to recover on 
a surety bond executed in plaintiff's iavor by Reposito Nomorosa, as principal 
debtor and General Indemnity Co., Inc., as surety. <p></p>
<p>Nomorosa died after answering the complaint, and the case against him was 
dismissed. General Indemnity Co., Inc., pleaded prescription. </p>
<p>After several incidents immaterial at this stage of the proceedings, the 
controversy was submitted for decision Upon a stipulation of facts the main 
terms of which ran as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On November 22, 1949 General Indemnity executed the bond Exh. B whereby it 
guaranteed, as surety, the payment by Reposito Nomorosa of the latter's mortgage 
debt to plaintiff Pao Chuan Wai in the amount of P2,500.00;</p>
<p>One paragraph of said bond provides: </p>
<p>" * * * Furthermore, it is hereby agreed and understood that the GENERAL 
INDEMNITY CO., INC., will not ba liable for any claim not discovered and 
presented to the company within THREE (3) months from the expiration of this 
bond and that the obligee hereby waives his right to file any court action 
against the surety after the termination of the period of three months above 
mentioned;" </p>
<p>Nomorosa did not pay the whole debt, there being a balance of P2,282.00; </p>
<p>On February 29, 1950 and March 29, 1950, plaintiff demanded payment of the 
account from the surety; </p>
<p>Defendant now refuses to pay on the ground that its liability under the bond 
extended only up to May 22, 1950, but this complaint was filed almost two years 
after such deadline; </p>
<p>The parties ask the court to decide on "the question as to whether or not the 
plaintiff has the right to collect from the defendant General Indemnity Co., 
Inc., the balance remaining unpaid by defendant R. Nomorosa, in the sum of 
P2,282.00 with 7 per cent interest from January 27, 1949, under the Surety Bond, 
Exhibit B. </p></blockquote>
<p>Acting upon the above submission, the trial judge dismissed the case, holding 
that the action had not been filed "within three months from the expiration of 
the bond" on or about February 22, 1950. (The suit began in February 1952.) </p>
<p>Pao Chuan Wei appealed in due time. He contends before this Court that his 
complaint had been seasonably filed, because within three months after the 
expiration of the bond, he presented to the surety on February 29 and March 29, 
1950, the claim for non-performance or non-payment by the principal debtor; and 
that such presentation rendered the surety liable, it being sufficient 
compliance with the condition precedent specified in the paragraph of the bond 
Exh. B herein-above quoted. </p>
<p>The appellee asserts in reply, that presentation of the claim and <i>filing 
of the action in court</i> must be made within three months after the expiration 
of the bond. </p>
<p>At first glance and without careful analysis, the last part of the paragraph 
of the bond herein-above quoted seems to justify appellee's assertion and the 
lower court's 'dismissal of the proceeding. </p>
<p>However, on second thought and on reading the whole paragraph the 
probability<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> appears that the parties meant, or the creditor understood, that he 
"waives his right to file any court action against the surety after the 
termination of the three-months above mentioned" <i>should he present no clqiai to 
the surety within said three-month period</i>. Observe specially that no punctuation 
separates the first part regarding presentation of claim and the second part 
regarding waiver. Which is an indication that the second part is a continuation 
of the first; and the two clauses must be taken together as referring to one 
topics presentation of claim within three months, and effect of 
non-presentation, (cf. Art. 1285 of the Civil Code.) The <i>second could not</i> 
obviously have meant <i>to amend the first part</i> by making it not only a condition 
precedent but also a limitation of action. </p>
<p>Indeed, as the parties expressly fixed the three month period for 
presentation of the claim as a condition precedent, they must have intended to 
give the surety, if the claim is presented within that period, some time to 
decide whether to pay or not to pay. (Because if it agrees to pay and pays, no 
complaint need be filed in court.) Now then, if the claim is presented on the 
90th or last day, to uphold the contention of appellee would deprive the surety 
of the chance to decide whether to pay or not to pay, and <i>would compel action on 
that same day </i>- regardless of the surety's attitude on the matter. That would be non-sensical, to put it strongly.<br></p>
<p>Again, appellee's contention implies that as the cause of action did not 
arise until the claim was presented on the last day, such <i>cause of action 
prescribed on same day</i>—if no complaint was filed on that very day. 
Evidently, the parties could not have contemplated—and agreed upon—such absurd 
result or requirement.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> And yet, if they 
had knowingly agreed thereto, the agreement is void because it fixed an 
unreasonable period of prescription for the creditor's right of action. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In some cases, apparently no longer authoritative es precedents, contractual 
limitation have been regarded as against public policy, and therefore 
unenforceable in the courts. The prevailing view, however, is that unless it 
contravenes a valid statute, or unless the time fixed is unreasonably short, 
such a provision is binding upon the contracting parties." (American 
Jurisprudence Vol. 3 p. 61.) </p>
<p>"In holding invalid as unreasonable a provision in a bond * * * the court in 
Page County vs. Fidelity &amp; D. Co. (1927) 205 Iowa, 798, 216 N. W. 957, said: 
'The proviso under consideration forbids an action for sixty days after default; 
and likewise forbids an action after the expiration of ninety days from the date 
of default. This brings upper and nether millstones into close proximity. It 
reduces the period of limitation to thirty days. This comes very close to an 
abrogation of the right of action. If the period of limitation can ever be 
deemed an unreasonable one, this one must be deemed such.' "(121 American Law 
Reports, Annovated p. 781.)</p></blockquote>
<p>If it should be argued that the stipulation could be interpreted either as a 
condition precedent only, or as both condition precedent and prescription, then 
we would holds it appearing that the bond was executed in a form prepared by the 
surety company, any ambiguity in the document must be interpreted against 
it<span class="style1">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></p>
<p>In the supposition, however, that the three-month time was actually intended 
by the parties as both a condition precedent and a limitation period, then the 
agreement would normally amount to: 45-days for filing claim and the other 
45-days for presenting court action. Then the inquiry suggests itself whether 
45-days would be a "reasonable period"; because as stated above, the authorities 
permit the contracting parties to fix a shorter limitation-of-action-period than 
that fixed by the statute, <i>provided, it is reasonable</i> (See American 
Jurisprudence <i>supra</i>.) </p>
<p>In an action upon a policy of insurance fixing a three-month period of 
limitation,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span> this Court impliedly hinting 
some doubt concerning its reasonbleness, did not pass on the point because 
unnecessary at the time. In a later case, a divided court declared it to be 
reasonable, following American precedents. (Teal Motor Co. vs. Orient Insurance 
Co. 59 Phil., 809.) Subsequently, however, the Legislature amended the Insurance 
Law by providing that "any stipulation in any policy of insurance limiting the 
time for commencing an action thereunder to a period of less than one year from 
the time the cause of action accrues <i>is void.</i>" (Sec. 61-A Insurance Act.)<br></p>
<p>A surety bond is not, of course, an insurance policy.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> There are similarities though, between 
bonding and insurance transactions; so much so that surety companies are placed 
under the supervision of the Insurance Commissioner. It would be an interesting 
matter to discuss whether the legislative view as to insurance policies 
(one-year minimum period) should also be applied to surety bonds issued by 
licensed surety companies, bearing in mind that in determining the 
reasonableness of the period fixed by contractual limitation courts "may resort 
to the standards and analogies of cognate statutes to inform their 
judgment."<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[6]</sup></span> This consideration all the 
more inclines us to the opinion that the bond here in question should receive 
the interpretation we give to it, namely, that the three-month period 
established only a condition precedent,-not a limitation of action. And in that 
light we must hold that inasmuch as plaintiff's claim had been presented to 
General Indemnity Co., Inc., within the three-months period, and as the action 
had been subsequently filed within the statutory time of prescription, <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[7]</sup></span>the case should not have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is reversed, and judgment is hereby entered 
requiring the defendant General Indemnity Co., Inc., to pay plaintiff the sum of 
P2,282.00 with 7% interest from January 27, 1949. Costs against appellee in both 
instances. So ordered.</p>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>Which on further examination turns into 
such certainly as is attainable through judicial process. 
<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>Still more absurd if the claim is 
presented to the surety on the last minute of the last day; because the next 
minute it prescribes. Any interpretation of the contact which leads to an 
absurdity should be rejected, and that interpretation which is reasonable and 
just should be preferred. (Ferrer vs. Ignacio, 39 Phil., 446.)</p>
