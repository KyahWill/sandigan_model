				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The Provincial  Government of Batangas instituted expropriation proceedings against Josefa Aguirre.  On August 28, 1940, the  Court of First Instance of Batangas rendered a decision, fixing the amount plaintiff should pay Josefa Aguirre for the expropriated land.  On August 26, 1941, a writ of execution was issued for the  collection of said amount  The writ was  still not complied with when the last global war broke out.</p>
<p>On July  24, 1945, an <em>alias</em> writ of execution was issued, properties of the plaintiff were attached, and sale at public auction of  the same was set for September 15, 1945.  On August 21, 1945,  plaintiff filed a motion to suspend  said alms writ of execution, invoking for said purpose the  debt moratorium provided in Executive  Order No.  25,  issued by the President of the Philippines  on November 18, 1944, wherein it  is provided:</p>
<p align="center">"III. DEBT  MORATORIUM</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. Payment of all  debts and other  monetary obligations contracted after December 31, 1941, except  debts and other monetary obligations entered into in any area after declaration by Executive Order that such  area  has been  freed from enemy occupation and control, is temporarily suspended pending action by the Commonwealth Government."  (41 Off. Gaz., No.  1, pp. 48, 50, April, 1945.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There presentation of defendant opposed  the motion, alleging that the debt sought to be satisfied by the writ of execution was contracted on  August 28, 1940, and, therefore, not within the terms of  Executive Order No. 25, which only affect debts and other monetary obligations contracted after December 31,  1941.</p>
<p>On August 28, 1945, respondent Judge  suspended the effects of the writ  of  execution issued on July 24,  194£, until the appropriate time  would arrive, invoking as authority Executive Order No.  25.</p>
<p>Petitioner, as  administrator of the  intestate estate of Josefa Aguirre, seeks to annul the said order of respondent judge by the petition  for  certiorari filed in the present ease.</p>
<p>At the hearing set for October 15,1945, nobody appeared to argue  orally.</p>
<p>The discussions  in all the pleadings  filed in  this case revolve  on the applicability of  Executive Order No. 25. No party mentioned  the fact that the same, with respect to debt moratorium, has been amended by Executive Order No. 32,  issued  by the President of  the Philippines  on March 10,  1945,  in  which the pertinent part  reads as follows:</p>
<p align="center">"in. DEBT MORATORIUM</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. Enforcement of payment of all  debts  and  other monetary obligations payable  within the  Philippines, except  debts  and other monetary  obligations  entered  into in any area after  declaration by President Proclamation that such  area has been freed from enemy occupation and  control, is temporarily suspended pending action by the  Commonwealth Government."   (41 Off. Gaz., No. 1, p. 56,  April, 1945.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it appears  evident that the debt  contracted by the Provincial  Government of Batangas in the expropriation proceedings was  "contracted before December 31,1941, and therefore  does  not fall  under  the debt  moratorium provision of Executive Order No. 25, it is covered, however, by the terms of Executive Order No. 82, which eliminated the time  limit fixed  in the former  as  starting  point for reckoning affected  debts and other monetary obligations." We conclude, therefore,  that  the order complained  of, although  invoking erroneously  Executive Order No. 25, was well  taken by virtue of the provisions of Executive Order No.  32.   The suspension  shall  continue  pending action by the Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p>Petition dismissed  without costs.</p>
