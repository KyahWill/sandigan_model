				<H3>VERONICA RUPERTO, PETITIONER, VS. CEFERINO FERNANDO AND LUCIO M. TIANCO, JUDGE OF MUNICIPAL COURT OF RIZAL CITY, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> From the record before us, it appears that a complaint of 
ejectment was filed by Ceferino Fernando, one of the respondents in this case, 
against Veronica Ruperto, petitioner, with the municipal court of Rizal city, in 
which the following, among others, is alleged:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"2. That the plaintiff is the exclusive and lawful lessee of a 
store space at the Libertad Public Market, Rizal City, by virtue of a lease 
contract executed and entered into by and between Rufino F. Mateo, Mayor, Rizal 
City, and Ceferino Fernando, as lessor and lessee respectively, under date of 
March 6, 1948, as per copy of the lease contract hereto attached as Exhibit A 
and forming part of his complaint;"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground (1) that 
the court has no jurisdiction over the case because it is not capable of 
pecuniary estimation, and (2) that the complaint does not state a cause of 
action.</p>
<p align="justify">An opposition to motion to dismiss was filed by the plaintiff 
in which the latter states the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The question at issue is clear: Who is legally entitled to the 
possession of the space in the Libertad Public Market? In other words: Who has a 
better leasehold right? The plaintiff or the defendant? The answer is 
inescapable, the plaintiff has a better leasehold right. The defendant claims 
she has a better leasehold right based upon a contract exeuted by and between 
the city mayor and the plaintiff. The city treasurer's permit was issued not in 
accordance with the prescribed rules, regulations and practice of the city in 
awardingmarket stalls. It is the practice of the city to lease store space by 
the treasurer. The court has jurisdiction, therefor. The jurisdiction of the 
court in an action of forcible entry and detainer is not lost even if the 
question of ownership or title is raised in the answer of the defendant as held 
in the case of Mediran vs. Villanueva, 37 Phil., 752. The fundamental issue, to 
repeat, in the instant case is that the justice of the peace court has 
jurisdiction to adjudicate the right of possession, and the defendant in an 
action before the justice of the peace to recover possession cannot deprive the 
court of such jurisdiction by merely claiming ownership or title to the property 
(Mediran vs. Villanueva, 37 Phil., 752)."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The municipal court denied the motion to dismiss for lack of 
merit on the ground that the defendant bases his contention that the court has 
no jurisdiction over the case on facts not alleged in the complaint, and hence 
the filing of the present civil action of certiorari, which may properly be 
considered as of prohibition, because the principal remedy sought is to prevent 
the respondent judge from taking cognizance of the case for lack of 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">The respondent to judge is not correct in holding that, in a 
motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, the defendant cannot 
"base his arguments on question of facts not touched in the complaint and which 
partakes the nature of special defenses, to be proved by presentation of 
evidence." A motion to dismiss under Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, is not like a 
demurrer provided for in the old Code of Civil Procedure that must be based only 
on the facts alleged in the complaint. Except where the ground is that the 
compalint does state no cause of action which must be based only on the 
allegations in the complaint, a motion to dismiss may be based on facts not 
alleged and may even deny those alleged in the complaint; and that is the reason 
why it is set for hearing for the presentation of evidence in support of and 
against the contention of the defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">In the present case, although no evidence was adduced in 
support of the contention of the defendant, the complaint and the opposition to 
the motion to dismiss clearly show that the court has no jurisdiction over the 
subject-matter of the action of the plaintiff, because it is neither an action 
of forcible entry nor of illegal detainer, but an action for the recognition of 
the plaintiff's preferred right to the use and occupancy of the stall in 
question in the Libertad Public Market against the claim of the defendant, and 
therefore not capable of pecuniary estimation. In the case of Torres vs. Ocampo 
(80 Phil., 36), this Court held the following that is squarely applicable to the 
present case for the determination of the nature of plaintiff's action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The action of the plaintiff against the defendant is not an 
action of forcible entry, for the simple reason that it is not an action 
instituted by a person who was in possession of a land or building against a 
person who has deprived him of the possession thereof by force, intimidation, 
threat, strategy or stealth, within one year from such unlawful deprivation. 
Assuming, without deciding, for the purpose of this decision that a market stall 
is a building or land within the meaning of Rule 72, Rules of Court; whatever 
right the plaintiff may have to occupy the market stall in question, originated 
upon the alleged award to plaintiff by the City Health Officer of Manila. And 
not having entered into possession under that award or lease of the market stall 
in dispute, plaintiff had acquired no right in the leased property in the nature 
of a right in rem, which third persons were bound to respect or not to 
infringe.</p>
<p align="justify">"The action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant was 
not an action of illegal detainer, because according to section 1, Rule 72 this 
action is for the recovery of possession of nay land or building, instituted 
within one year from date of illegal possession, by a person against whom the 
possession of any land or building is being unlawfully withheld by another after 
the right of the latter to hold possession <i>by virute of any contract, express 
or implied</i>, with the plaintiff has expired or terminated. In the present 
case, there was no contract whatsoever, express or implied, between plaintiff 
and defendant for the possession of the market stall, and hence no expiration or 
termination of the latter's right to hold possession thereof under 
contract."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, it is evident that the municipal 
court of Rizal City has no jurisdiction over the case, and the respondent judge 
is therefore ordered to desist and refrain from further proceeding in the 
present case, with costs against the respondent Ceferino Fernando. So 
ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, 
JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>PERFECTO, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">We are opinion that the grounds upon which the majority have 
decided to reverse the action of the municipal court of Rizal City are too 
technical for purposes of substantial justice.</p>
<p align="justify">The complaint filed by Ceferino Fernando has raised a case of 
illegal detainer and, therefore, within the jurisdiction of inferior court where 
it was instituted.</p>
<p align="justify">The purpose of the summary proceedings outlined by the rules in 
cases of illegal detainer is for expeditious settlement of controversial 
possession, as such controversies may give occasion to disturbance to peace and 
order. The purpose is to nip int he bud a dispute which may lead to more serious 
conflicts and consequences. That purpose is defeated by the majority 
decision.</p> We vote to deny the petition.</div>
