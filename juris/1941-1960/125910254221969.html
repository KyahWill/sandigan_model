				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Trizon  Remollino  alias Eming was  prosecuted  for the crime of multiple murder under the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The undersigned accuses Trizon Remollino, alias 'Eming' of the crime of Multiple  Murder, committed  as follows:</p>
  <p>'That on or about the 13th day of March, 1958 in the evening, in barrio Bacag, Municipality of Villasis, Province of Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this  Honorable  Ccurt,  the above-named accused, with  treachery  and evident premeditation, with intent  to kill and armed  with  a  carbine,  Serial No. 6791173, did, then and there wilfully  and feloniously fire at and shoot successively and  at short intervals  Isabelo  Nozuelo,  Carlos  Nozuelo, Francisco Sepnio, Jacinto Sepnio,  Santos Moreno and Epifanio Bascos, thereby inflicting mortal  wounds on the  different parts of the bodies  of his  victims causing their death as a consequence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before arraignment, the  accused,  through  counsel,  offered to enter a plea of guilty to the lesser  offense of multiple homicide.  The  trial court allowed  the accused to plead guilty to multiple homicide on the basis of which the said court rendered judgment,  as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore,  this Court finds the accused  Trizon  Remollino alias Eming, guilty  beyond reasonable  doubt  of  the  crime of sextuple homicide, and hereby imposes upon said accused to suffer the penalty of not  less  than eight (8)  years of <em>prision mayor</em> to  not more than fourteen (14) years, eight  (8) months of <em>reclusion tempora</em>l in  each and everyone of  the three  (3)  homicidal acts, but in no case shall the accused suffer more than  the  maximum total penalty of forty (40) years under par.  4, Art-70 of the  Revised Penal Code; and to indemnify the heirs of each of the deceased Isabelo Nozuelo, Carlos Nozuelo, Francisco Sepnio, Jacinto Sepnio, Santos Moreno and Epifanio Bascos, in the sum of P4,000.00 with costs against the accused.</p>
  <p>This Court refrains from imposing further penalties for the three (3) other deceased in view of the prohibition  contained in par. 4, Art. 70 of the  Revised Penal Code."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the belief,  however, that the penalty imposed is not correct, the  said accused appealed directly to this Court alleging that the trial  court  erred:  (1) In imposing upon him  three separate penalties  for the several  homicides charged in the above information; and (2)  In refusing to apply the  provisions of Article 48  and  paragraph 5  of Article 64  of the Revised  Penal  Code.</p>
<p>In other words, appellant contends  that  Article 48  of the Revised  Penal  Code  on  penalty for complex  crimes which provides: "When  a single act  constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, or when an offense is a necessary means for committing the other, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be  imposed, the same to be applied in its  maximum period"  (As amended by Act No. 4000), should have been imposed.  The display of erudition by counsel  as  to the philosophy  and spirit which animate the penal provision in question, fails, however, to convince us that Article 48 is applicable to the present case.   From the allegations of the information, which appellant admitted with his plea of  guilty, there  can be no doubt that he shot six persons successively and at short intervals and that the deaths of said persons were the result of six  separate acts. It can not be contended with any  degree of plausibility that only one shot or  single act had killed the six victims.  Our jurisprudence  is replete with precedents  sustaining that acts, such as the one before us, should  constitute separate crimes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"But when the acts  are  wholly  different, not  only to  themselves, but also  because they  were directed against two different persons, as  when one fires his revolver twice in succession, killing  one person and wounding another (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Ferrer, 1 Phil., 56), or when two persons are killed one after the other, by  different  acts, although those  killings were the result of a single criminal impulse (People <em>vs</em>. Alfinado, 47 Phil., 1), the different acts must be considered as distinct crimes.  So also, raping a girl and killing her afterwards constitute two distinct offenses which  must be punished  separately (People <em>vs</em>. Matela, 58 Phil., 718;  1  Reyes, L.B.  Criminal Law, p. 382)".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  the case of People <em>vs</em>. Jose Pardo, et al., 79 Phil., 568, the Supreme  Court held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"But the trial court erred in holding that the offenses in question constitute a complex  crime.  The two murders were  not the Yesult of a single act.  The  death of Captain Burchfield was  produced by a  shot different from that which killed Francisco Cañete. It  will be recalled  that two  shots  were fired, and this made additionally clear  by the other fact that two holes were  found in the wall, about a foot apart, and that a slug lodged in the left leg of Burchfield while another bullet was found not far from the  prostrate  body of  FranciscoCañete .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In People <em>vs</em>. Layos,  60 Phil., 232,  this Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"It  is noted, however, the trial  court did not consider such findings strictly in conformity with the law inasmuch as it considered the act committed by the appellant as merely constituting the complex crime of double homicide when such is not the case,  taking into consideration the spirit and text of Art.  48 of the Rev.  Penal Code.  According to said Article in order that the crime may be  considered double homicide it is necessary that it  be the result of a single act, as in the case of killing two persons at the  same moment with the  single stroke of  the bolo or with a single shot.</p>
  <p>"'Our conclusion is that the defendant-appellant is guilty of two separate crimes of murder.   (People <em>vs</em>. Mabugat, 51 Phil., 967)'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In  the case of People <em>vs</em>. Meliton Buyco, 80 Phil., 58, this Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * The  Supreme Court of Spain held in  its judgment of January 27, 1876, that one who, after a dispute, discharges  four  shots from a pistol,  mortally wounding with the first one of the combatants and inflicting  with the second physical injuries upon another, should be  punished for the said crimes separately in  accordance with Art. 88  of the Spanish Penal Code upon the ground that, although the shots were fired successively, they did not constitute one single  but two  diverse acts, for the two different persons at whom they were directed  (II Viada, 5th ed. pp. 633-634).  The same Tribunal in its judgment of Feb.  7, 1879, held that a person who, posting himself in front of four individuals, fires four  shots with a pistol saying: 'toma tu, toma tu,' wounding two of them, is guilty of four different crimes of discharge of firearm against a determinate  person,  two complexed with that of physical injuries, since the four shots were produced by four distinct acts (II  Viada, 5th ed. p.  636)."</p>
  <p>"Where an accused began firing  with his  .45 caliber  automatic pistol at a crowd gathered in front of a  church, and when the crowd rushed inside  the  church the accused followed and continued firing at random until he was seized and  overpowered,  and disarmed by an Army sergeant who happened to be there, as a result  of which firing two  persons died and one seriously  wounded who, however recovered due to medical aid, three separate crimes were committed. (People  <em>vs</em>.  Basarain,  G.R.  No. L-6690, May 24, 1955).</p>
  <p>"Accused was prosecuted for killing two persons.  Sixteen wounds were inflicted on one and five wounds on the other.  Held: In order that a crime may  be considered double homicide, in accordance with the provisions of  Art.  48 of the Rev.  Penal  Code,  it is necessary that it  be the result of a single act, as in  the case of killing  two persons at the same moment with a  single stroke of the bolo or with a single shot.  The homicide perpetrated by  the  herein  defendant on a woman and  on another person  did not constitute a single  act but  two distinct acts  committed at  different  times.  The  former's death was the result of sixteen wounds inflicted upon her by the  appellant  and that of the latter  was  likewise the  result of the  five wounds which he inflicted upon her immediately afterwards.   (People <em>vs</em>. Layos, 60 Phil., 224)."   (Crim. Procedure, Padilla, p. 107, 1959 Ed.)</p>
  <p>"The  evidence presented by the prosecution in this case was strong enough  to convict  the accused who shot  to death two brothers.  One of the questions raised  in the appeal was the  lower court's decision in convicting  the  accused for the crime of  double murder and  not for complex  crime.  Held:   A complex crime is committed when two  persons  are killed as a result  of the same murderous  act of the accused.   When each one of the two  deceased was killed  by different and  separate sets of shots  fired, respectively, through  two independent sets of acts of  the accused, each one aimed  exclusively at a victim, for each victim killed there  is a separate and independent crime of murder.  (People <em>vs</em>. Ordonio, 82 Phil.  324)."   (Crim. Procedure,  Padilla, p.  107, 1959 Ed.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, appellant cited the case of People <em>vs</em>. Lawas, G. R. Nos. L-7618-7620, in support of his cause.  We are of the opinion,  however, that  the ruling in  said  case  is predicated upon the peculiar  circumstances  surrounding the same, and it should not be applicable to the one at bar. Verily, the Lawas doctrine is more of an exception than the general  rule.  In the Lawas  case  we held  each  of the appellants  guilty only of the complex crime  of homicide, notwithstanding  the fact that  about fifty persons  were killed.   The evidence in said case revealed that the killings were the result of a single impulse, in  obedience to the order of the appellants'  leader to fire, which ceased only when the said leader gave an order to stop firing.  There was no evidence at all  to  show  the number of persons killed by each  appellant.   It  was  not   possible  to  hold each appellant  responsible for  each death  he  actually caused, because there was no way to determine who  were the particular persons killed by each appellant.  That is why this Court in said case  commented:  "So  even  if we  were  induced to hold each appellant responsible for each and every death caused by him, it is impossible to ascertain the individual death caused by each and everyone. We are,  therefore, forced to find  the appellants guilty of only one offense, that of multiple homicide, for which the penalty to be imposed should be in the maximum".  In the case at bar, the appellant alone killed all the six victims, one after the other, with one shot each.</p>
<p>Counsel submits that had the trial court appreciated the mitigating circumstances of plea of guilty and obfuscation, the penalty should have been reduced by one degree.  Since the maximum penalty of 14 years and 8 months of <em>reclusion temporal</em> was imposed upon appellant for each homicide and the same is within the minimum of the penalty fixed for the  crime,  there  being  no aggravating  circumstance  to consider, it  is  logical  to conclude that  the trial court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty. As  to obfuscation, it appears that appellant had not offered evidence to prove any other mitigating circumstance than the plea of guilty.</p>
<p>It  is  to be noted that  the  trial  court sentenced  the appellant  in  each of  three (3)  homicidal  acts, without specifying for which of the six (6) homicides they were intended.  Appellant should be sentenced, as we do hereby sentence him, to suffer  the same  penalty in each of the other three  (3)  crimes he  had committed, and to pay an indemnity to the heirs of each of the six cases, in the sum of P6,000.00.</p>
<p>Holding, therefore, that the appellant Trizon Remollino alias Eming  is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of six  separate homicides, and  modified in the sense just indicated, the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all  other  respects, with costs against the  appellant.</p>
