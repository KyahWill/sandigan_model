				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review of a decision of the Court of Appeals, involving the central issue of the validity of the marriage <span style="font-style: italic;">in articulo mortis</span>  between.  Matea de la Cruz  and  Felipe Apelan Felix. <br><br>It appears  that long before, and  during the War of the Pacific, these two persons lived together as wife and husband at Cabrera Street, Pasay City.  They acquired properties but had no children.   In the early part of the liberation of Manila  and surrounding territory,  Matea became seriously  ill.  Knowing  her critical  condition, two young ladies of legal age dedicated to the service of God, named Carmen  Ordiales and Judith Vizcarra<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> visited and persuaded her to go to confession.  They fetched Father Gerardo Bautista,  Catholic parish priest of Pasay.  The latter, upon learning that the penitent had been  living with Felipe Apelan  Felix without  benefit  of marriage, asked both parties to ratify their union according  to the rites of his Church.  Both agreed.  Whereupon the priest heard the confession of the bedridden old  woman, gave her Holy  Communion, administered the  Sacrament of Extreme  Unction  and then  solemnized her  marriage with Felipe Apelan Felix <span style="font-style: italic;">in articilo mortis</span>,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> Carmen Ordiales and  Judith Vizcarra  acting as sponsors or witnesses.  It was  then  January 29 or 30, 1945. <br><br>After a few  months, Matea recovered from her sickness; but  death was not  to be denied, and in January 1946, she was interred in Pasay,  the same Fr. Bautista performing the burial ceremonies. <br><br>On May  12,  1952, Arsenio  de  Loria and Ricarda de Loria filed this complaint  to compel  defendant to render an accounting and to deliver the properties left by the deceased. They are grandchildren  of Adriana de la Cruz, sister of Matea,  and claim  to be the only surviving forced heirs of  the  latter.  Felipe Apelan  Felix  resisted  the action,  setting up his rights as widower.  They obtained favorable  judgment in the court of first instance, but on appeal the Court of Appeals reversed and  dismissed  the complaint. <br><br>Their request  for review here was  given due course principally to consider the legal  question-which they amply discussed in their petition and printed brief—whether the events which took place in January  1945 constituted, in the eyes of the law, a valid and binding marriage. <br><blockquote>"There is no  doubt at all in the mind of this  Court, that Fr. Gerardo Bautista,  solemnized the marriage <span style="font-style: italic;">in articulo  mortis</span>  of Defendant Apelan Felix and Matea de la Cruz,  on January  29 and 30, 1945,  under the circumstances set  forth in the  reverend's testimony in court.  Fr. Bautista, a respectable old priest of Pasay City  then, had no reason to side one or the other. * * *  Notwithstanding this positive evidence  on. the celebration or performance  of the marriage in question, Plaintiffs-Appellees contend that that  the same was not in articulo mortis, because Matea de  la Cruz  was not then on  the point of death.  Fr. Bautista clearly testified, however, that  her condition  at the time  was  bad; she was bedridden;  and according to his observation, she might die at  any moment  (Exhibit 1), so apprehensive was he about her condition that  he decided in administering to her the sacrament of extreme unction, after hearing her confession, x x x .The greatest objection of the Appellees and the trial court against the validity of the marriage  tinder  consideration, is the admitted fact that  it was not registered.' </blockquote>      The applicable legal provisions are  contained in  the Marriage Law of  1929  (Act No.  3613)  as amended by Commonwealth  Act  No.  114  (Nov. 1936)  specially  sections 1, 3, 20 and 21. There  is no  question about the officiating priest's  authority to solemnize  marriage.   <br><br>There is also no question that  the  parties had  legal capacity to contract marriage, and that both  declared before  Fr. Bautista  and  Carmen Ordiales  and Judith  Vizcarra that "they took each other as husband and wife." <br><br>The  appellants' contention  of invalidity  rests on these propositions: <br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="5%"><div align="center">(a)</div></td><td width="90%"> <div align="justify">There  was no "marriage contract"  signed by the wedded couple  the witnesses  and  the  priest,  as required by section 3  of the Marriage Law; and </div></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td><div align="center">(b)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">The priest filed no affidavit, nor recorded the marriage with the local  civil registry.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The factual basis of the first proposition—no signing—may  seriously be  doubted. The Court of  Appeals made no finding thereon.  Indeed if anything, its  decision  impliedly held such marriage contract to have been executed, since it said "the marriage in articulo mortis was a fact", and the only question at issue was whether "the failure of Fr. Bautista to send copies of <span style="font-style: italic;">the certificate of marriage in question</span> to the Local Civil Registrar and to register the said marriage in the Record of Marriages  of  the  Pasay Catholic Church * * * renders the said marriage invalid." And  such was the only issue  tendered in  the court  of first instance.   (See p.  14,  34, Record on  Appeal.) <br><br>However, we may as well face this second issue:   Does the failure to  sign the "marriage certificate or contract" constitute a cause for nullity? <br><br>Marriage contract is the "instrument in triplicate" mentioned in sec. 3 of the Marriage Law which provides: <br><blockquote>"Sec.3.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Mutual Consent</span>.—No particular form for the ceremony of marriage is  required, but the  parties with  legal  capacity to contract marriage must declare, in the presence  of the person solemnizing the marriage and of two witnesses of legal age, that they take each other as husband and wife.  <span style="font-style: italic;">This declaration shall be set forth in an instrument in triplicate</span>, signed  by  signature or mark  by  the contracting parties and  said two witnesses and  attested by  the person solemnizing   the  marriage. * * *."  (Italics ours). </blockquote>In  the first  place, the Marriage Law  itself, in sections 28, 29  and 30 enumerates  the causes  for annulment  of marriage.  Failure to sign  the marriage  contract  is not one of them. <br><br>In the  second place, bearing in  mind that the "essential requisites for marriage are  the legal capacity of the  contracting parties and their consent" (section 1), the latter being manifested by the declaration of  "the parties"  "in the presence of the person solemnizing the marriage and of two witnesses of legal age  that  they take each other as  husband  and  wife"—which in  this  case actually  occurred.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup>  We think the signing of the  marriage contract or certificate was required by the statute simply for the  purpose  of evidencing the act.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</span></sup>   No statutory provision or court ruling  has been cited  making it an  <span style="font-style: italic;">essential </span>requisite—not the <span style="font-style: italic;">formal </span>requirement of evidentiary value, which  we  believe it  is.  The  fact  of  marriage  is  one thing; the  proof by  which it may be established is quite another. <br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Certificate and Record</span>.—Statutes relating  to  the  solemnization of marriage usually  provide for the  issuance of a  certificate  of marriage  and for  the registration or  recording of marriage * * * Generally speaking,  the registration  or recording of a marriage is not essential  to its validity, the statute being addressed to the officials issuing  the  license,  certifying  the marriage,  and  making the proper return and registration or recording."  (Sec. 27 American  Jurisprudence "Marriage" p. 197-198.)<br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Formal Requisites</span>.—* * *The general rule, however,  is  that statutes which direct that a license  must be  issued and procured, that only certain persons shall perform the ceremony, that a certain number of witnesses shall be  present,  <span style="font-style: italic;">that a  certificate  of the marriage shall  be  signed</span>, returned,  and  recorded, and  that persons violating the conditions shall be guilty of a criminal offense, are addressed to persons in authority  to secure publicity and  to require  a record to be made of the  marriage contract.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Such statutes do not  void </span>common-law  marriages  unless  they do so expressly, <span style="font-style: italic;">even where  such marriage  are entered  into  without obtaining  a license</span> and are not recorded.  <span style="font-style: italic;">It  is  the purpose of these statutes</span> to  discourage deception and seduction, prevent illicit intercourse under  the  guise of matrimony, and relieve from doubt the status of parties  who live together as  man and wife,  <span style="font-style: italic;">by  providing competent evidence  of the  marriage.</span> * * *." (Section 15 American Jurisprudence "Marriage"  pp.  188-189.)   Italics Ours. (See  also Corpus  Juris  Secundum "Marriage" Sec.  33.)</blockquote>And our law  says, "no marriage shall be declared invalid because  of  the  absence  of  one  or several formal requirements of this Act * * *."  (Section 27.) <br><br>In the third place,  the law, imposing on the priest the duty to  furnish to the  parties copies  of  such  marriage certificate  (section 16) and punishing  him for its omission  (section 41)  implies <span style="font-style: italic;">his  obligation  to  see</span> that such   "certificate" is executed accordingly.   Hence, it would not be fair to  visit upon the wedded  couple in the form of annulment, Father Bautista's omission, if any, which apparently had been caused by the prevailing disorder during the liberation of Manila and its  environs. <br><br>Identical remarks apply to the priest's failure to make and  file the affidavit required by sections 20 and  21.  It was the priest's obligation; non-compliance with it, should bring no serious consequences lo the married pair, specially where as in this case, it was caused by the emergency. <br><blockquote>"The mere fact that the parish  priest  who married the  plaintiff's natural father and  mother, while the latter was in articulo mortis, failed to send a copy of the marriage  certificate to the municipal secretary,  does not invalidate  said marriage,  since it does not appear that  in  the  celebration thereof  all requisites for its validity were not present, the forwarding of a copy of the marriage certificate not being one of the requisites."  (Jones <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hortiguela, 64 Phil. 179.)  See also  Madridejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> De Leon, 55 Phil. 1.</blockquote> The law  permits <span style="font-style: italic;">in articulo  mortis</span> marriages,  without marriage license; but it requires the priest to make the affidavit and file it.  Such affidavit contains the data  usually required  for the issuance  of  a  marriage  license. The first <span style="font-style: italic;">practically substitutes</span> the latter.  Now  then, if a marriage celebrated without  the license  is not voidable (under Act 3613),<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</span></sup>  this marriage   should not  also be voidable for lack of such  affidavit. <br><br>In line  with  the policy to  encourage  the legalization of the union of men and  women who have lived  publicly in a state of concubinage <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</span></sup>, (section 22), we must hold this marriage to be  valid. <br><br>The widower, needless to add, has better rights to the estate of the  deceased  than the plaintiffs who  are the grandchildren of her sister Adriana.  "In the absence of brothers or sisters and of nephews, children of the former, * * * the surviving spouse * * * shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased." (Art 952, Civil Code.)<br><br>Wherefore,  the Court of  Appeals'  decision is affirmed, with costs.   So ordered. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
