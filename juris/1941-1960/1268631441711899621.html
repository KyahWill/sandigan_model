				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In consequence of the elections held November 11, 1947, the 
municipal board of canvassers of Lumban, Laguna, proclaimed Vicente Ferrer as 
mayor-elect, with a plurality of 363 votes over the next candidate Lorenzo 
Llamoso.
<p align="justify">Llamoso filed <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings alleging that 
Ferrer was disqualified for lack of legal residence. After hearing, the court of 
first instance of Laguna declared the position vacant, stating that Ferrer had 
not the legal requisites necessary to be validly elected.</p>
<p align="justify">Both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals, which in due 
course, confirmed the ineligibility of Ferrer, but declined to transfer "the 
palm of victory" to Llamoso who "had not received the popular verdict". It 
affirmed the decision of the court of first instance.</p>
<p align="justify">These two petitions for certiorari to review the judgment of 
the Court of Appeals refer to the same controversy. On the one hand, Ferrer 
maintains he was not disqualified; on the other, Llamoso argues that he should 
be declared elected upon the disqualification of Ferrer. </p>
<p align="justify">On the first point, the decision of the Court of Appeals finds 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"On October 24, 1947, the petitioner Lorenzo Llamoso filed with 
the Justice of the Peace Court of Santa Cruz, Laguna, a petition for the 
exclusion of the respondent Vicente Ferrer from the registry list of voters of 
Precinct No. 6 of the Municipality of Lumban, for alleged lack of six months' 
residence in the said municipality, as required by section 98 of Republic Act 
No. 180 (Revised Election Code). The Justice of the Peace denied the petition, 
and petitioner appealed to the Court of First Instance of Laguna where the 
appeal was docketed as Civil Case No. 3984, entitled 'Lorenzo Llamoso vs. Board 
of Inspectors of Lumban, etc.' After hearing, the court rendered on November 4, 
1947, a decision reversing the judgment of the justice of the peace and ordering 
the exclusion of the respondent Vicente Ferrer from the registry list of voters 
of said Precinct No. 6. The Respondent brought the case to the Supreme Court on 
certiorari (G. R. No. L-1784), but the high court was able to dispose of the 
petition only on November 13, 1947, or two days after the election. In its 
resolution dismissing the petition for certiorari, the high court said that the 
petition had no merit and the question therein involved had already become 
moot."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Court of Appeals held that the judgments above mentioned 
are conclusive on the lack of qualifications of Ferrer. Invoking our ruling in 
Nuval vs. Guray, 52 Phil., 645, Ferrer says the appellate court committed error. 
Supposing that the case fits the situation now, and that the judgments were not 
conclusive, inasmuch as the record does not show the contrary (that in fact he 
had the required residence), we must confirm the finding that he is and was 
ineligible. (Sec. 2174, Adm. Code, in connection with sec. 96 of Republic Act 
No. 180.)</p>
<p align="justify">The petition of Llamoso raises this question: When the winning 
candidate turns out to be disqualified, is the candidate receiving the next 
highest number of votes entitled to the office?</p>
<p align="justify">The parties have failed to call our attention to a previous 
decision of this Court squarely on the matter. Ferrer's counsel calls attention 
to Topacio vs. Paredes, 23 Phil., 238, wherein it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Again, the effect of a decision that a candidate is not 
entitled to the office because of fraud or irregularities in the election is 
quite different from that produced by declaring a person ineligible to hold such 
an office. * * * In the former, we have a contest in the strict sense of the 
word, because opposing parties are striving for supremacy. If it be found that 
the successful candidate (according to the board of canvassers) obtained a 
plurality in an illegal manner, and that another candidate was the <i>real 
victor</i>, the former must retire in favor of the latter. In the other case, 
there is not, strictly speaking, a contest, as the wreath of victory cannot be 
transferred from an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole 
question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast 
ballots". (Topacio vs. Paredes, <i>supra</i>, 254, 255.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Section 173 of Republic Act No. 180 establishing the procedure 
when a person who is not eligible is elected to a provincial or municipal office 
says that any registered candidate may contest his right to the position by 
<i>quo warranto</i> proceedings. It does not provide that if the contestee is 
declared ineligible the contestant will be proclaimed. Indeed it may be gathered 
that the law contemplates no such result, because it permits the filing of the 
contest by <i>any </i>registered candidate irrespective of whether the latter 
occupied the next highest place or the lowest in the election returns.</p>
<p align="justify">As a matter of fact the American precedents on Elections hold 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is a fundamental idea in all republican form government 
that no one can be declared elected and no measure can be declared carried, 
unless he or it receives a majority or a plurality of the legal votes cast in 
the election. Accordingly, the general rule is that the fact that a plurality or 
a majority of the votes are east for an ineligible candidate at a popular 
election does not entitle the candidate receiving the next highest number of 
votes to be declared elected. In such case the electors have failed to make a 
choice and the election is a nullity". (29 Corpus Juris Secundum, 353.)</p>
<p align="justify">"* * * although the candidate voted for by a majority cannot be 
declared elected because of his ineligibility and the majority vote is thereby 
rendered ineffective for such purpose, such majority vote is effective to forbid 
the election of the candidate having the next highest number of votes. The 
effect is to render the purported election nugatory and to leave a vacancy in 
the office thus attempted to be filled". (18 American Jurisprudence, 
353.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Wherefore the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. No 
costs.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Padilla, Tuason, 
Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
