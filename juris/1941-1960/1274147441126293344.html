				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 15, 1946, the Municipal Court of Manila rendered judgment in the 
ejectment case instituted by petitioners against Jesus Hiponia, Hemandas Udharam 
and Tiu Sam, the dispositive part of which is as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants 
ordering the latter to vacate the premises described in the complaint, and to 
pay <i>jointly and severally</i> the plaintiffs all the unpaid rentals due from 
February, 1946, up to and including April, 1946; when the complaint was filed, 
at the rate of P2,000 a month, less the amount of P4,000 already paid by the 
defendant Tiu Sam. And for the use and occupation of the premises from May, 
1946, until they shall have completely vacated the same, the said defendants are 
likewise sentenced to pay <i>jointly and severally</i> the plaintiffs the sum of 
P3,000 a month, which, in view of the evidence adduced, is found by the Court to 
be fairly just and reasonable. The defendants are likewise sentenced to pay the 
costs of this suit."</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 21, petitioners filed a motion for execution of the judgment, which 
was granted on June 27. On June 26, defendant Hemandas Udharam filed his notice 
of appeal. The other two defendants did not appeal.</p>
<p>On August 16, appellant Udharam filed with the Court of First Instance of 
Manila a motion praying for refund to him of the sum of P1,000 he deposited as 
supersedeas bond, notwithstanding which he was ejected from the premises on July 
6. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, alleging that as of July 6, 1946, movant was 
liable, jointly and severally with his co-defendants, under the decision of the 
municipal court, to pay to plaintiffs the sum of P8,600, representing back rents 
and reasonable compensation and that the deposit of P1,000 in question is liable 
for the payment of said rents, and damages and costs.</p>
<p>On September 9, Judge Dinglasan granted Udharam's motion in an order which 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appearing that the amount of P1,000 was deposited as supersedeas bond 
independently of the deposit of P500 as rent for the period from June 10, 1945 
to July 19, 1946, and it further appearing that the Court in accordance with 
section 8 of Rule 72 of the Rules of Court immediately issued an execution order 
instead of staying execution of the judgment, notwithstanding the filing of the 
supersedeas bond of P1,000, thus in effect disapproving said bond as 
insufficient, the Court finds that the motion filed by Attorneys Monsod, Montesa 
and Manikan for the defendant Hemandas Udharam is in order insofar only as the 
refund of the sum of P1,000 prayed for therein is concerned, but not as to the 
refund of P216 out of the deposit of P500 monthly rent is concerned.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to refund to the defendant 
Udharam or his attorneys the supersedeas bond deposit of P1,000, as evidenced by 
official receipt No. 758239."</p></blockquote>
<p>On September 12, petitioners moved for the reconsideration of the order, but 
the motion was denied on September 25.</p>
<p>Complaining that respondent acted in evident excess of his jurisdiction 
and/or with grave abuse of discretion by issuing his orders of September 9 and 
25, petitioners filed the petition for certiorari at bar, seeking the annulment 
of said orders.</p>
<p>The facts stated above constitute the material allegations of the 
petition.</p>
<p>Petitioners' contention is based on the following provisions as quoted in 
their petition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" '* * * All moneys so paid to the Court of First Instance shall be deposited 
in the provincial treasury, or in the City of Manila in the Insular Treasury, 
and <i>shall</i> be held there until the final disposition of the appeal.' (Rule 
72, section 8, Rules of Court.)</p>
<p>" ' * * * If the case is tried on its merits in the Court of First Instance, 
any money paid into court by the defendant for the purposes of stay of execution 
shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the judgment of the 
Court of First Instance.' (Rule 72, section 8, Rules of 
Court.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>Respondents maintained that the above provisions are not applicable to the 
deposit in question for the following reasons: (1) Because the above provisions 
refer to money "paid to the Court," while the delivery to the court of the 
P1,000 in question was made not as a payment, but as a mere deposit; (2) Because 
said deposit, made as supersedeas bond as one of the means of staying the 
execution of the municipal court's judgment, was never accepted by the court 
which proceeded notwithstanding, to order the execution of the judgment, as a 
result thereof Hemandas Udharam was in fact ousted from the premises on July 6, 
1946; and (3) Because, in view of the decision of this in Mitschiener <i>vs</i>. 
Barrios (76 Phil., 55), there was not even the necessity for Udharam to make the 
deposit as supersedeas bond to stay execution of the judgment in view of the 
fact that he has deposited on June 20, 1946, the sum of P500 as his monthly rent 
for June 19 to July 18, 1946, under the contract of lease.</p>
<p>Respondents' allegation as to the non-acceptance of the deposit is supported 
by the statement made by Judge Dinglasan in his order of September 9, to the 
following effect: "It appearing that the court in accordance with section 8 of 
Rule 72 of the Rules of Court immediately issued an execution order instead of 
staying execution of the judgment, notwithstanding the filing of the supersedeas 
bond of P1,000, thus in effect disapproving said bond as insufficient."</p>
<p>There seems to be no doubt that the rule provisions invoked by petitioners 
are inapplicable to the deposit in question. The moneys mentioned by section 8 
of Rule 72 include only the rent due from time to time under the contract or, in 
the absence thereof, the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the 
premises as adjudged by the justice of the peace or municipal court. The sum of 
P1,000 in question was delivered by Udharam, not as a payment for the rents or 
reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises but as a purported 
supersedeas bond which, by its insufficiency, was rejected by the court. The 
deposit having been made for a specific purpose, cannot be used for a different 
one. The deposit having been rejected, it stands to reason that it should be 
returned to the depositor. We conclude that the respondent judge acted according 
to law in issuing its orders of September 9 and 25.</p>
<p>Petition denied, with costs against petitioners.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, 
Hilado, Briones,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p>PARAS, <i>J.</i>, with whom concur PABLO and 
BENGZON, <i>JJ.</i>:</p>
<p>The respondent Hemandas Udharam, one of the three defendants in a detainer 
case, has appealed from the decision of the Municipal Court of Manila in favor 
of the herein petitioners, which sentenced all the defendants to pay jointly and 
severally some P8,000 for back rents. Said respondent, who is the only 
appellant, deposited P1,000 in lieu of a supersedeas bond. Inasmuch as the 
amount was utterly insufficient, an order of execution was duly issued and 
carried out.</p>
<p>The respondent Hemandas Udharam tiled a petition to withdraw the aforesaid 
deposit, and the respondent judge granted the same in his order of September 9, 
1946. The herein petitioners seek the annulment of this order and allege that 
the deposit should be kept until the appeal shall have been decided on the 
merits.</p>
<p>There is a judgment for back rents much exceeding the amount deposited; and 
the respondent Hemandas Udharam may be held liable for the whole thereof. As the 
deposit was made to secure the payment of rents in arrears, the same has to be 
maintained until the final termination of said respondent's appeal, regardless 
of the fact that, due to its insufficiency for which the petitioners cannot be 
blamed, execution was ordered. Let us suppose that execution was suspended upon 
the filing of a sufficient supersedeas bond, but the respondent has failed to 
continue depositing or paying the monthly rents. There is no doubt that, in such 
case, execution may upon motion be issued as a matter of course. I do not think 
that the respondent will be entitled to the withdrawal of the deposits he had 
already made, or even to the cancellation of the supersedeas bond. Otherwise, a 
tenant lacking in good faith may, after depositing or paying the current rents 
for many months and without desisting from his appeal, stop doing so and 
disregard execution, as long as he gets back what he had deposited, especially 
when he is at any rate ready to vacate, in which case the winning landlord may 
probably lose the only chance of ever collecting the rents that had accrued 
prior to execution.</p>I therefore vote for the granting of the petition.</div>
