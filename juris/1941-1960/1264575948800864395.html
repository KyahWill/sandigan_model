				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> The respondent, who is&nbsp; an attorney-at-law, is&nbsp; charged with malpractice for having published an advertisement in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>&nbsp; of June 13, 1943, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Marriage<br></div><br>"license promptly&nbsp; secured thru our assistance &amp;&nbsp; the annoyance of delay or&nbsp; publicity avoided if desired, and marriage arranged to&nbsp; wishes of parties.&nbsp; Consultation on any matter free for the poor.&nbsp; Everything confidential.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 480px;">"Legal assistance service<br>12 Escolta, Manila, Room 105<br>Tel. 2-41-60."</div></blockquote>Appearing in his own behalf, respondent at first denied having published the said advertisement; but subsequently, thru&nbsp; his attorney, he admitted having caused its publication and prayed for "the indulgence and mercy" of&nbsp; the Court, promising&nbsp; "not to repeat such&nbsp; professional misconduct in the future and to abide himself to the strict ethical&nbsp; rules of the law profession."&nbsp; In further mitigation he alleged that the said advertisement&nbsp; was&nbsp; published only&nbsp; once in&nbsp; the <i>Tribune</i> and that he never had any case at law by reason thereof.<br><br>Upon that plea the case was submitted to the Court for decision.<br><br>It is undeniable that the advertisement in question was a flagrant violation&nbsp; by the respondent of the ethics of his profession, it being a brazen solicitation of business from the public.&nbsp; Section 25 of Rule 127 expressly provides among other things that&nbsp; "the practice of soliciting cases at law for the purpose of&nbsp; gain,&nbsp; either personally or thru paid agents or brokers, constitutes malpractice."&nbsp;&nbsp; It is highly unethical for an attorney to advertise his talents or skill as a merchant advertises his wares.&nbsp; Law is a profession and not a trade.&nbsp; The lawyer degrades himself and his profession who stoops to and adopts the practices of mercantilism by&nbsp; advertising his services or offering&nbsp; them to the public. As a member of the bar, he denies&nbsp; the temple of justice with mercenary activities as the money-changers of old defiled the temple of Jehovah.&nbsp; "The most worthy&nbsp; and effective advertisement possible, even for a&nbsp; young lawyer,&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * is the establishment of a well-merited reputation for professional capacity and fidelity to trust.&nbsp; This cannot be forced but must be the outcome oi character and conduct." (Canon 27, Code of Ethics.)<br><br>In <i>In re Tagorda</i>,&nbsp; 53 Phil., 37, the respondent attorney was suspended from the practice&nbsp; of&nbsp; law for the period of one month for advertising his services&nbsp; and soliciting work from the public by writing circular letters.&nbsp; That case, however, was more serious than this because there the solicitations were repeatedly made and were more elaborate and insistent.<br><br>Considering his plea for leniency and his&nbsp; promise not to repeat the misconduct, the Court is of the&nbsp; opinion and so decides that the respondent should&nbsp; be, as he hereby is, reprimanded.<br><br><i>Yulo, C. J.y Moron, Horrilleno, Paras</i>, and <i>Bocobo, JJ.</i>, concur. </div>
