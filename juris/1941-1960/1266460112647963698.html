				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-2004, May 24, 1949</h4>
				<H3>PABLO COTAOCO, PETITIONER, VS. RAFAEL DINGLASAN, JOSE L. UY, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> It appears that Pablo Cotaoco, the petitioner, crought an 
action against Jose L. Uy and others to recover certain real property and a sum 
of moeny by way of rents and damages. After the plaintiff had introduced his 
evidence and rested, the defendants, through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss 
action for the alleged reason that the plaintiff was shown not to be the real 
party in interest but his brother, Mariano Cotaoco. That motion was denied, 
whereupon the plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the merits. The latter 
motion was likewise denied, as was also a subsequent motion for 
reconsideration.
<p align="justify">The plaintiff now applies from this Court a command to the 
trial judge to decide the case as he prayed in the court below and to restrain 
His Honor from receiving evidence for the defendants or from taking any further 
step. In support of the petition, he cites Moody, Aronson &amp; Co. vs. Hotel 
Bilbao, 50 Phil., 198; Gonzalez Castro vs. Azaola, 63 Phil., 841; and Arroyo vs. 
Andrea Azur, 76 Phil., 493.</p>
<p align="justify">We do not think the petitioner is entitled to the relief 
applied for. The cases cited do not sustain his position. It will be observed 
that in each of those cases the defendant appealed. In the present case no 
appeal was taken from the court's order.</p>
<p align="justify">The decisions relied upon do not rest on any positive law, but 
on general "rules which will avoid lengthy and expensive litigations and which 
will assist in the speedy disposition of cases." The mere filing of a motion to 
dismiss and the adverse ruling thereon by the trial court do not create a 
multiplicity of suits which the law abhors; it is the prosecution of an appeal 
from the court's decision that does. Before a case has left the hands of the 
trial court, the latter, at the very least, ought to have discretionary power to 
allow the presentation of evidence by the defendant. In fact the refusal of the 
lower court to bar the defendants form introducing evidence and to decide the 
cause solely on the evidence already adduced, is in accord with this Court's 
admonition in Castro vs. Azaola, <i>supra</i>. In that case the court stressed 
the advisability of deferring action on a motion to dismiss untill all the 
evidence was in. It said: "This Court is of the opinion that in cases like this 
the defendant should be required to present his evidence instead of acting upon 
his motion to dismiss, so that should the court find the decision to be 
erroneous, it would not have to remand the case to the court of origin for 
further proceedings, * * *" The court's denial of the motion to dismiss amounted 
in its results to a compliance with that injuction. In denying the motion 
instead of not acitng thereon, the court has not closed the door to the 
dismissal of the case on ghe grounds stated in the motion after both parties 
have submitted the case for decision. On the other hand, the situation envisaged 
by the court in the Azaola decision was likely to materialize in the case at bar 
if the tiral court were to exclude the defendants' evidence and this Court 
should reverse the decision, because the motion to dismiss is not predicated on 
insufficiency of the evidence on the issues joined in the pleadings, but on the 
alleged fact that the plaintiff is a mere dummy of his brother. The motion to 
dismiss raises a side issue leaving entirely out o fth epicutre the cardinal 
defense that the deed fo sale with a mortgage, on which the action is based, 
"does not express the true intent and agreement of the parties," a defense which 
could not properly be determined on the plaintiff's proofs alone.</p>
<p align="justify">We are not prepared to say that the respondent judge committed 
a mistake. This conclusion makes superfluous discussion of the special plea that 
mandamus does not lie in the case at bar.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is denied with costs against the petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p> Moran, C. J.:<p></p>
<p align="justify">I concur in the result.</p></div>
