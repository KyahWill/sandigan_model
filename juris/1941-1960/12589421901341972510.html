				<H3>PEOPLE  OF THE  PHILIPPINES,  PLAINTIFF  AND APPELLEE  VS. CARIDAD CAPISTRANO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Caridad  Capistrano was  charged in  the  Court of First Instance of Rizal  with the violation of Circular  No. 37, as implemented by Circular No.  60, Section  1  (b) of the Central  Bank, in  relation to Section 34 of Republic Act No. 265, committed as follows: <br><blockquote>"The undersigned  City Attorney  accuses  Caridad Capistrano  of Violation of  Circular No. 37, as  implemented by Circular No. 60, Section 1  (b)  of the  Central  Bank,  in relation to section  34  of Republic Act No. 265, committed  as follows: <br><br>"That on or  about  the 31st day  of March, 1955, in the  Manila International Airport, Pasay City, Philippines, and within  the jurisdiction of this  Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Caridad Capistrano, and outgoing Philippine resident who had booked passage and ready to leave the Philippines for  Hongkong through Philippine Air  Lines  plane,  did  then and  there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in  her possession and control,  concealed  in her person, in a  sanitary pad (Kotex brand) the  following, to  wit: </blockquote>  <table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="30%">&nbsp;</td><td width="41%"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"100 pcs at P50.00 each ........P5,000.00</span></td><td width="29%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Contrary to Law." </span> </td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">A  motion  to quash  having  been  denied,  the accused entered a plea of not  guilty.  When the case was called for trial, however,  she admitted the  act alleged in the information but averred that said act  did not constitute a public offense.   Thereafter, without either  the prosecution  or the  defense  adducing  any  evidence, the  lower court rendered judgment finding the accused guilty and sentencing her to suffer one month  imprisonment and  to pay  a fine of  P200.00, with subsidiary imprisonment  in case  of insolvency,  and  to  pay  the  costs.  She appealed from this decision directly  to this Court on  purely  questions of law. <br><br>In this appeal  the accused reiterated her plea that the act alleged in the  information does not  constitute a public offense because Circular No. 60 of the Central Bank, the violation of which she is charged, is null and void, predicating  her contention on  the  following grounds:  (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) that it was  not approved by the President of the Philippines as required by the Central Bank Act (Republic Act No.  265);  (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that  the  exercise  of the powers by  the Monetary Board  of  the Central Bank under Section 74 of said Act is authorized  only  during  exchange  crisis; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)  that the  delegation  by  Congress to the Monetary Board of the power to declare the existence of an exchange crisis is unconstitutional;  (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) that Circular No. 60 is <span style="font-style: italic;">ultra vires</span> in that it treats of the licensee of  the importation and  exportation of Philippine currency which is alien to foreign exchange, the only subject of the authority  of the Monetary Board to license under Section 74; and  (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)  that Circular No. 37  (now Circular  No. 60)  amends  and  enlarges the scope of Sections 2710 and 2711 of the Revised Administrative Code. <br><br>While there are good reasons for upholding the validity of Circular No. 60 of the Central Bank under the authority given to  the Monetary Board by  Section 14 of Republic Act  No. 265 as interpreted by  this  Court in People  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Exconde,  101  Phil.,   1125 we don't  deem it necessary however to go into a meticulous discussion of the  issues raised by appellant,  it being sufficient to  state that, on the hypothesis  that such circular is valid, the information suffers  from a fatal  defect in that  it  does not  allege an important element which  is considered  indispensable to constitute a violation of the circular  in question. <br><br>As expressly recited in the information, appellant is accused of violating Section  1  (b)  of Circular No. 60 of the Central Bank the pertinent portions of which we quote: <br><blockquote>"Section 1. The import and export  of Philippine coins and notes including but  not limited to  drafts checks, money  orders  and/or other bills of exchange in Philippine pesos drawn on banks operating in the Philippines, or any order for payment in Philippine  pesos, is  prohibited without  the  necessary license issued by the  Central Bank, except in  the  following cases; <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">* * * * * * * <br></div><br>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)  Outgoing  Philippine residents and transient visitors leaving the Philippines may  take with them  Philippine  coins and  notes in an amount not exceeding P100, provided the coins do not exceed P5."  (Italics supplied) </blockquote>From the above  it is  manifest  that  in order that the pertinent portion of the circular  may be infringed,  it is necessary to allege  that  the  outgoing Philippine resident or transient visitor has taken  or  is  about to  take  out of the  Philippines Philippine coins  and notes in excess  of the  exempted  amounts  <span style="font-style: italic;">without the  necessary license  issued by the  Central Bank</span>.  An  examination  of  the  information  does not show any  averment  of this  element. This omission makes the charge alleged  in the  information insufficient  to  constitute an  offense for  which appellant may be convicted and rendered  amenable to  the  penalty prescribed by law. <br><blockquote>"* *  * The complaint, in a criminal case, must state every fact necessary to make out  an offense.  (U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cook, 17 Wall. (U.S.), 168.)  The complaint   must  show,  on  its face  that, if  the facts alleged  are  true, an  offense has been  committed.  It must state explicitly and directly every fact  and  circumstance necessary to constitute an offense."   (U. S., <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Pompeya, 31 Phil.,  245, 256-257) <br><br>"Where the information is not merely defective  but it  does  not charge  any  offense at  all,  technically  speaking that information does  not exist in contemplation  of  law."  (People  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Austria, 50 Off.  Gaz., No. 5, p. 1967; 94 Phil., 897.)</blockquote> Wherefore,  the  decision appealed  from  is hereby  reversed.  The appellant is acquitted and  the  sum of P5,000 confiscated  from  her ordered returned  to her, with  costs de oficio. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,  J. B. L.,  Endencia,</span>  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix,  JJ., </span>concur. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, A., J.,</span> concurs in  the result. <br>              <br></div>
