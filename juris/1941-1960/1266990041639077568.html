				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners herein are all attorneys of&nbsp; record of Oscar Castelo accused of murder in Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 3023-P of the Court of First Instance of Rizal&nbsp; which was presided over by Hon. Emilio Rilloraza.&nbsp; Castelo filed a motion dated September 7,&nbsp; 1955 for the disqualification of Judge Rilloraza&nbsp; to try said case anew by&nbsp; virtue of a new trial granted by the Supreme Court.&nbsp; On September 24,&nbsp; 1955, Judge&nbsp; Rilloraza issued an order which reads as follows:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"In order to protect the integrity and dignity of this Court and the Judiciary, the accused-petitioner Oscar Castelo is hereby ordered to appear before this Court on&nbsp; September 29, 1955, at 10:30&nbsp; o'clock a.m.,&nbsp; to show cause why he should&nbsp; not be punished for contempt for having made contemptuous&nbsp; statements&nbsp; and malicious imputations&nbsp; and&nbsp; insinuations&nbsp; or intimations that&nbsp; are&nbsp; absolutely without foundation&nbsp; in truth and in fact in&nbsp; his petition for recusation&nbsp; or disqualification dated September 7, 1955,&nbsp; among which statements read, in part, as follows:<br></p><blockquote><p>' * * * This belief on the part of Melencio of the futility, of defending himself in&nbsp; the face of an apparent conspiracy between the Presiding Judge and the prosecutors was not without justification. What indeed would have been the use of&nbsp; further resistance when the Judge and the prosecutors could talk over the telephone with such familiarity and apparent rapport indicating&nbsp; connivance&nbsp; between them,' * * *</p><p>'Significantly, or is it strange&nbsp; that the&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; extort P100,000.00&nbsp; from herein petitioner&nbsp; (Oscar Castelo) resulted in his conviction to death?'</p><p>* * *&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>"The attorneys of record of said accused, petitioner Oscar Castelo, namely, Mariano H. de Joya, Estanislao A. Fernandez, Roberto A. Guianzon, Pelicisimo Ocampo, Constancio&nbsp; M. Leuterio, Lauro Esteban and Alejandro&nbsp; de&nbsp; Santos,&nbsp; are hereby likewise ordered&nbsp; to appear&nbsp; before this&nbsp; Court on September 29, 1955, at 10:30&nbsp; o'clock a.m.,&nbsp; to show cause why they should not&nbsp; be punished for contempt for having prepared the statements referred to above and/or&nbsp; having counselled the accused-petitioner Oscar Castelo to make said statements, or&nbsp; for having otherwise&nbsp; given him advice concerning the same statements&nbsp; and&nbsp; imputations&nbsp; and&nbsp; insinuations and intimations."</p></blockquote><p>Castelo filed his own answer to the charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Atty. Mariano H.&nbsp; de Joya filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; separate answer, while the&nbsp; other respondents&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a joint&nbsp; answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; These&nbsp; answers&nbsp;&nbsp; were sworn to&nbsp; respectively by Castelo and respondent attorneys. After hearing,&nbsp; respondent judge found Castelo&nbsp; and his attorneys guilty of direct contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Castelo was&nbsp; ordered to pay a fine&nbsp; of P200 while his attorneys, now petitioners herein,&nbsp; were&nbsp; ordered to pay a fine&nbsp; of PICO&nbsp; each,&nbsp; payable on or&nbsp; before noon&nbsp; of October 8,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; with&nbsp; subsidiary imprisonment in&nbsp; case of non-payment of the fine Hence the present petition for certiorari&nbsp; imputing grave&nbsp; abuse of discretion&nbsp; to respondent judge.</p><p>The incident arose in view of certain alleged contemptuous statements&nbsp; contained in a motion for disqualification filed with the&nbsp; court&nbsp; on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; which was signed and sworn to exclusively by&nbsp; Oscar&nbsp; Castelo but the notice&nbsp; of hearing set forth therein&nbsp; appears&nbsp; to&nbsp; have been subscribed by&nbsp; all&nbsp; his&nbsp; attorneys, petitioners&nbsp; herein,&nbsp; although only one of them, Alejandro de Santos, has&nbsp; actually signed.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; notice reads:</p><p align="center">"NOTIFICATION</p><table align="center" border="0" width="90%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="31">To: </td> <td colspan="2" valign="top">The Clerk of Court<br> Court of First Instance of Rizal<br> Pasay City Branch</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3" valign="top">Sir:</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2" valign="top">Please set the foregoing&nbsp; petition for hearing1 on&nbsp; September 10, 1955, at 8:30 in the morning or as soon thereafter as the&nbsp; Honorable Judge&nbsp; may be pleased to hear the same.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top" width="314">Mariano H. de Joya</td> <td valign="top" width="360">Constancio M.

Felicisimo Lazaro for&nbsp; contempt&nbsp; for deceiving the court in being&nbsp; a party&nbsp; to&nbsp; the feigned illness of Melencio which caused the suspension, of the trial for about two weeks. Judge Emilio Rilloraza did&nbsp; not.&nbsp; This failure on the part of Fiscal&nbsp; Andres Reyes to deny Melencio's statement involving&nbsp; him, and&nbsp; the omission on the part of the Presiding&nbsp; Judge, by&nbsp; remaining passive on a matter which demanded action on his part, rules out all&nbsp; conclusions but that&nbsp; Presiding Judge&nbsp; was too consumed&nbsp; with&nbsp; bias to care, and that Fiscal Andres Reyes&nbsp; had been licensed to do what he pleases&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Judge's name with&nbsp; brazen impunity."&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 53-56) </p></blockquote><p align="center">"INCIDENTS AFTER THE TRIAL </p><p align="center"><em> First Incident </em></p><blockquote><p>Before the promulgation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; decision in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; on March 31,&nbsp; 1955, the name of Honorable Judge Emilio Rilloraza was&nbsp; bandied&nbsp; about during the conversation between Mrs.&nbsp; Saldana, owner of the&nbsp; San Juan de&nbsp; Dios Coffee Shop on Dewey Boulevard, Pasay City, Mrs.&nbsp; Eugenia L. Co, who claims kinship with the Presiding Judge and&nbsp; Miss Adelaida Reyes, one of the former accused in&nbsp; the case.&nbsp; Miss Reyes was contacted by the two ladies (Mrs. Saldana and Mrs. Co) in the evening of March 10, 1955 and informed that herein petitioner together with all the defendants in this case were to be convicted by Judge&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; Rilloraza and that the&nbsp; penalty was one of death.&nbsp; Mrs. Eugenia&nbsp; L. Co assured Miss Reyes that she&nbsp; had read the&nbsp; decision which was&nbsp; shown to her by 'Tiong'— the&nbsp; Presiding Judge. Mrs. Co, pretending to take&nbsp; pity on Miss Reyes who&nbsp; broke down into tears upon&nbsp; being informed of this said news, stated that 'there is nothing&nbsp; that could&nbsp; be remedied' and she started foisting&nbsp; herself as a 'relative', 'business partner' and very&nbsp; influential&nbsp; with the Presiding Judge whom she calls&nbsp; 'Tiong' Mrs.&nbsp; Co further represented&nbsp; to&nbsp; Miss Reyes that there&nbsp; is&nbsp; nothing that she could not secure from&nbsp; her 'Tiong',&nbsp; adding that her husband who&nbsp; was a Chinese citizen was able to obtain his&nbsp; Philippine citizenship through Judge Emilio Rilloraza, which&nbsp; assertions were confirmed by&nbsp; Mrs. Rufina&nbsp; Saldana.&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp; Miss Reyes&nbsp; asked&nbsp; the two ladies what could be done about the matter, Mrs. Eugenia L. Co readily&nbsp; and brazenly&nbsp; told Miss Reyes to convey to herein petitioner a demand for the sum of f 100,000 in consideration for his acquittaX, It was impressed upon Miss Adelaida Reyes.by&nbsp; Mrs. Eugenia L.&nbsp; Co and&nbsp; Mrs. Rufina Saldana that with the payment of PI 00,000,&nbsp; the decision which according to Mrs. Co the&nbsp; Presiding Judge&nbsp; allowed her to read could be&nbsp; changed and the acquittal&nbsp; of herein petitioner secured.</p><p>Apprised of this demand,&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner was&nbsp; enraged, and reported the&nbsp; matter to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Army&nbsp; and Constabulary authorities on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 11, 1955.&nbsp; Major Teodulo Natividad and&nbsp; Major Delfin de la Cruz&nbsp; of the Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary&nbsp; investigated the&nbsp; matter and&nbsp; gathered&nbsp; what evidence they could and later sought clarification from the Presiding Judge as to his knowledge&nbsp; or participation in the&nbsp; attempted&nbsp; extortion.&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Rilloraza's reaction&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Natividad's inquiry in the matter was a mere denial&nbsp; of any knowledge of the affair and a refusal to cooperate with the PC authorities.</p><p>It is&nbsp; a serious&nbsp; matter for a&nbsp; judge's name to be made&nbsp; capital of in a transaction which reflects upon his integrity&nbsp; and upon the dignity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the court&nbsp; presided over by him.&nbsp; And when,&nbsp; as&nbsp; in this incident, his name is&nbsp; inextricably linked, positive action on his part is imperative. But the Presiding Judge viewed this&nbsp; incident with indifference if not&nbsp; with&nbsp; plain tacit acquiescence.&nbsp; He could&nbsp; have cited&nbsp; Mrs.&nbsp; Eugenia L.&nbsp; Co and&nbsp; Mrs. Rufina Saldana for contempt of court.&nbsp; He&nbsp; did not—which&nbsp; is pregnant with meaning.</p><p>Significantly, or is it strange&nbsp; that the failure to extort P100,000 from&nbsp; herein petitioner resulted in his conviction to death?&nbsp; And&nbsp; as previously conveyed by Mrs. Eugenia L. Co to Miss Reyes on&nbsp; March 10 and March&nbsp; H, 1955&nbsp; all the accused including the&nbsp; petir&nbsp; turner were condemned to death."&nbsp; (pp. 59-61).&nbsp; "(pp. 2-5,&nbsp; Answer of Solicitor&nbsp; General) </p></blockquote><p>In&nbsp; his answer,&nbsp; respondent Castelo avers&nbsp; that he assumes full responsibility for the preparation&nbsp; and filing of the petition for disqualification&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; judge; that&nbsp; his attorneys&nbsp; of record have absolutely no participation nor intervention&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; preparation of said petition&nbsp; their only intervention being to sign the notice of bearing&nbsp; addressed&nbsp; to the&nbsp; clerk of court; and that the statements alleged&nbsp; in the&nbsp; charge do&nbsp; not constitute&nbsp; contempt.&nbsp; Castelo further&nbsp; avers that, as the supposed&nbsp; contumacious act constitute&nbsp; merely contempt, the proceedings must&nbsp; commence with the filing of a charge.&nbsp; And&nbsp; that as&nbsp; the charge&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed by respondent judge&nbsp; himself,&nbsp; he should&nbsp; inhibit himself from hearing and&nbsp; deciding the same.&nbsp; "He cannot be the&nbsp; complainant, prosecutor,&nbsp; and judge at the same&nbsp; time."</p><p>With the exception of respondent De Joya, who&nbsp; filed a separate answer, the other respondent attorneys, in their answer,&nbsp; over that&nbsp; they&nbsp; had no intervention in the&nbsp; preparation of, nor have they counselled Castelo in making the statements&nbsp; in,&nbsp; his petition&nbsp; for disqualification, their only&nbsp; intervention being&nbsp; to&nbsp; sign the notice of hearing of said&nbsp; petition.&nbsp; They&nbsp; further aver&nbsp; that,&nbsp; as the&nbsp; alleged statements constitute indirect contempt and the judge himself has made the&nbsp; charge,&nbsp; respondent judge is disqualified to hear and decide the&nbsp; same.</p><p>Respondent De Joya, in his answer, avers,&nbsp; among other things, that he did not&nbsp; take part in the preparation of the petition for disqualification and knew nothing&nbsp; of the conditions&nbsp; and&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; under which&nbsp; it was&nbsp; prepared; that said petition was signed and&nbsp; sworn to only and exclusively by Oscar Castelo and he came to know of its existence only&nbsp; after&nbsp; it&nbsp; had been filed; that in&nbsp; connection therewith his name had been included only in the notice of hearing; that said petition for&nbsp; disqualification is privileged in nature; that contempt proceedings being criminal in nature, no&nbsp; one can be held responsible for a statement made by another; and that courts of justice and judicial&nbsp; officers should never&nbsp; act with vindictiveness&nbsp; in the preservation of judicial decorum.&nbsp; He prayed that the charge be dismissed as to him.</p><p>The questions to be&nbsp; determined&nbsp; are:&nbsp; (1) Are the alleged statements imputed to petitioners&nbsp; contemptuous&nbsp; in character?; (2) If so, do&nbsp; they constitute direct contempt?; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Has respondent judge erred in finding&nbsp; petitioners guilty of the charge?&nbsp; </p><ol><li> It should&nbsp; be&nbsp; noted that one Augusto Melencio&nbsp; is one&nbsp; of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution&nbsp; in the murder case then pending against Oscar Castelo and among the&nbsp; incidents cited&nbsp; in the&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; disqualification&nbsp; to bolster up&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim that respondent judge should&nbsp; inhibit himself in&nbsp; trying the case anew is the insinuation that Melencio was made to sign certain statements in line with the prosecution's&nbsp; plan to utilize&nbsp; him as a state witness principally to implicate Castelo after the prosecution has realized that&nbsp; the testimony of Robles was insufficient and unreliable to serve as basis of Castelo's conviction.&nbsp; It was stated that Melencio, as a means of impressing him of the hopelessness of his situation, was made to&nbsp; hear a conversation through the telephone between Fiscal Andres Reyes and&nbsp; respondent judge which, according to Melencio,&nbsp; had&nbsp; the effect&nbsp; of&nbsp; convincing&nbsp; him that his salvation was possible only&nbsp; through&nbsp; submission to the desire of the prosecutors to have him testify as a witness&nbsp; against Castelo,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; in the last part of the narration, the following&nbsp; comment appears:&nbsp; "This belief on the part of Melencio of the futility of defending himself&nbsp; in the face of an apparent&nbsp; conspiracy between the presiding judge and the prosecutors was&nbsp; not without justification.&nbsp; What indeed would have been the use of further resistance when the judge and the&nbsp; prosecutors&nbsp; could talk over&nbsp; the telephone&nbsp; with such familiarity, and&nbsp; apparent rapport&nbsp; indicating connivance between them?"</li></ol><p>Another incident cited in&nbsp; the petition refers&nbsp; to&nbsp; the alleged attempt to bribe respondent judge to secure the exoneration of&nbsp; Castelo.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that, before&nbsp; the promulgation of the decision in the murder case on March 31, 1955, two ladies, Mrs. Saldana and Mrs. Eugenia L. Co, informed Miss Adelaida Reyes that Castelo&nbsp; and his co-acussed were sure to be convicted and given the penalty of death, which&nbsp; made Miss Reyes&nbsp; break down into&nbsp; tears. When Mrs. Co informed Miss Reyes that she was a relative and&nbsp; very influential with respondent judge and that there&nbsp; was nothing that&nbsp; she could&nbsp; not secure from him, she asked Mrs.&nbsp; Co what could be done about the matter. It was then that Mrs. Co brazenly told&nbsp; Miss Reyes that the remedy was for Castelo to offer the&nbsp; sum of P100,000 for his acquittal.&nbsp; It was impressed upon Miss&nbsp; Reyes by Mrs. Co and&nbsp; Mrs.&nbsp; Saldana that with such&nbsp; payment of P100,000 the decision could&nbsp; be changed and&nbsp; the acquittal of Castelo&nbsp; secured.&nbsp; Informed of&nbsp; this&nbsp; incident, Castelo was enraged&nbsp; and reported the matter to the&nbsp; army&nbsp; and constabulary authorities.&nbsp; The narration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; whple incident closes&nbsp; with the following comment:&nbsp;&nbsp; Significantly, or is it&nbsp; strange&nbsp; that the failure to extort P100,000 from herein petitioner resulted in his conviction to&nbsp; death?&nbsp; And as previously conveyed by Mrs.&nbsp; Eugenia L. Co to Miss Reyes on March 10 and March 14, 1955 all the accused including the petitioner were condemned to death."</p><p>There&nbsp; is no doubt that the&nbsp; insinuations or imputations contained in the above statements appearing in the petition&nbsp; for disqualification&nbsp; are not only contemptuous&nbsp; but have no basis in the&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; They are&nbsp; contemptuous because,&nbsp; on&nbsp; one hand, they accuse respondent judge of conspiracy or connivance with the prosecutors or concocting a plan with a view to securing the conviction of Oscar Castelo&nbsp; and, on&nbsp; the other hand they implicate the judge in a supposed attempt to extort money from Castelo on a promise&nbsp; or assurance of&nbsp; his&nbsp; acquittal.&nbsp; Obviously, such insinuations&nbsp; or imputations are highly derogatory&nbsp; and serve&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; but to discredit&nbsp; the&nbsp; judge&nbsp; presiding the court in an attempt to&nbsp; secure his disqualification.&nbsp; They are derogatory for,&nbsp; under the circumstances they were uttered,&nbsp; they cannot but reflect on&nbsp; the honesty and integrity of the judge.&nbsp; They have no place in a court pleading and, if uttered&nbsp; by a member&nbsp; of the bar, constitutes a serious disrespect.&nbsp; "As an officer of the&nbsp; court, it is his sworn and moral&nbsp; duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily the&nbsp; high&nbsp; esteem and regard towards the&nbsp; courts so&nbsp; essential&nbsp; to the proper&nbsp; administration of&nbsp; justice" [People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Carillo,&nbsp; 43, Off. Gaz., (12)&nbsp; p. 5012].&nbsp; </p><ol start="2"><li> The alleged&nbsp; contemptuous&nbsp; statements, having been made in a pleading submitted to the court, constitute1 direct contempt within the meaning of&nbsp; the law. As&nbsp; held, by this Court in the case of Salcedo <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Hernandez (61 Phil., 724), the act of a lawyer in inserting a paragraph, containing contemptuous phrases,&nbsp; in a motion&nbsp; filed in a case pending before&nbsp; the Supreme Court, "constitutes a contempt in the case of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; (in&nbsp; facie&nbsp; curiae)."&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in the case of&nbsp; Lualhati <em>vs.</em> Albert, 57 Phil., 86,&nbsp; the facts of which are on all&nbsp; fours with the incident at&nbsp; bar, it was held that the trial judge did not act without or&nbsp; in&nbsp; excess of his jurisdiction, nor abuse his discretion, when he found a lawyer in contempt of court for submitting an urgent motion praying that the trial judge&nbsp; inhibit himself from hearing&nbsp; on retrial a criminal&nbsp; case against the&nbsp; client of said lawyer,&nbsp; which&nbsp; urgent motion, in the opinion of the judge, tended to make the public believe that&nbsp; he was incapable of administering justice to&nbsp; the accused. Indeed, the act of petitioners constitutes direct contempt within the meaning&nbsp; of section 1, Rule 64,&nbsp; of the Rules of Court, for it is&nbsp; tantamount to a "misbehavior in the presence of or so near a cpurt or judge as to&nbsp; interrupt the administration of justice."&nbsp;&nbsp; Verily, with&nbsp; such&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; or mis-behavior the proceedings relative to the retrial have been unnecessarily delayed to the detriment of the administration of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>In connection with the responsibility of petitioners, it is true that Castelo stated in his answer that he assumes full&nbsp; responsibility for&nbsp; the preparation&nbsp; and filing of&nbsp; the petition for&nbsp; disqualification&nbsp; containing&nbsp; the contemptuous statements and that his&nbsp; attorneys of record&nbsp; have had absolutely&nbsp; no participation or&nbsp; intervention in&nbsp; the&nbsp; preparation of said&nbsp; petition other&nbsp; than signing the notice of hearing appearing&nbsp; therein addressed to the clerk of court.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; this averment of&nbsp; Castelo&nbsp; notwithstanding, there appears on the face of the same petition&nbsp; a circumstance which belies such statement.&nbsp; Thus, in&nbsp; the opening statement of said petition the following appears: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Comes now&nbsp; the accused Oscar Castelo&nbsp; who, only for&nbsp; the purpose of this petition, hereby enters his appearance in collaboration with his attorneys of record,</span> and to&nbsp; this Honorable Court respectfully manifests:"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied). This statement is an indication that both Castelo and his attorneys joined in submitting the above petition for disqualification.</li></ol><p>It is likewise true that the notice of hearing appears signed only by Atty. Alejandro&nbsp; de Santos, although&nbsp; the names of the other attorneys merely appear written therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, this gives the impression that the notification was&nbsp; placed in the petition without&nbsp; the knowledge and&nbsp; consent&nbsp; of the attorneys who have&nbsp; not&nbsp; signed and common sense dictates that&nbsp; they should not be made accountable thereof.&nbsp; But this&nbsp; surmise&nbsp; or assumption is belied by the subsequent development of the case for&nbsp; the record shows that during the hearing of&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for disqualification held on September 10 and 12,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the herein petitioners not&nbsp; only appeared for accused Castelo but&nbsp; urged&nbsp; its approval, which shows that at least they acted with&nbsp; full knowledge of&nbsp; the contents thereof and took&nbsp; notice of their import and significance.&nbsp;&nbsp; In urging for its approval they indirectly endorsed&nbsp; and gave force and validity&nbsp; to the&nbsp; statements and arguments embodied therein.&nbsp; With such&nbsp; a behavior they cannot now be heard to contend that they are ignorant of the contemptuous statements contained in the&nbsp; petition in an&nbsp; effort to&nbsp; escape&nbsp; liability. In the&nbsp; circumstances, we&nbsp; are persuaded to conclude that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; judge did not commit any abuse of discretion&nbsp; in&nbsp; issuing the order&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of the present petition.</p><p>Petition is denied, without pronouncement as to costs. The writ of injunction issued by this Court is&nbsp; hereby dissolved.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</em> and <em>Felix, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
