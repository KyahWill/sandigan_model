				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal, by petitioner Wenceslao Pascual, from a decision of the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal, dismissing the above entitled case and dissolving the 
writ of preliminary injunction therein issued, without costs.
<p>On August 31, 1954, petitioner Wenceslao Pascual, as Provincial Governor of 
Rizal, instituted this action for declaratory relief, with injunction, upon the 
ground that Republic Act No. 920, entitled "An Act Appropriating Funds for 
Public Works", approved on June 20, 1953, contained, in section 1-C (a) thereof, 
an item (43 [h]) of P85,000.00, "for the construction, reconstruction, repair, 
extension and improvement" of "Pasig feeder road terminals (Gen. Roxas—Gen. 
Araneta—Gen. Lucban—Gen. Capinpin—Gen. Segundo—Gen. Delgado—Gen. Malvar— Gen. 
Lim)"; that, at the time of the passage and approval of said Act, the 
aforementioned feeder roads were "nothing but projected and planned subdivision 
roads, not yet constructed, * * * within the Antonio Subdivision * * * situated 
at * * * Pasig, Rizal" (according- to the tracings attached to the petition as 
Annexes A and B, near Shaw Boulevard, not far away from the intersection between 
the latter and Highway 54), which projected feeder roads "do not connect any 
government property or any important premises to the main highway"; that the 
aforementioned Antonio Subdivision (as well as the lands on which said feeder 
roads were to be constructed) were private properties of respondent Jose C. 
Zulueta, who, at the time of the passage and approval of said Act, was a member 
of the Senate of the Philippines; that on May 29, 195S, respondent Zulueta, 
addressed a letter to the Municipal Council of Pasig, Rizal, offering to donate 
said projected feeder roads to the municipality of Pasig, Rizal; that, on June 
13, 1953, the offer was accepted by the council, subject to the condition "that 
the donor would submit a plan of the said roads and agree to change the names of 
two of them"; that no deed of donation in favor of the municipality of Pasig 
was, however, executed; that on July 10, 1953, respondent Zulueta wrote another 
letter to said council, calling attention to the approval of Republic Act No. 
920, and the sum of P85.000.00 appropriated therein for the construction of the 
projected feeder roads in question; that the municipal council of Pasig endorsed 
said letter of respondent Zulueta to the District Engineer of Rizal, who, up to 
the present "has not made any endorsement thereon"; that inasmuch as the 
projected feeder roads in question were private property at the time of the 
passage and approval of Republic Act No. 920, the appropriation of P85.000.00 
therein made, for the construction, reconstruction, repair, extension and 
improvement of said projected feeder roads, was "illegal and, therefore, void 
<em>ab initio</em>"; that said appropriation of P85,000.00 was made by Congress 
because its members were made to believe that the projected feeder roads in 
question were "public roads and not private streets of a private subdivision"' ; 
that, "in order to give a semblance of legality, where there is absolutely none, 
to the aforementioned appropriation", respondent Zulueta executed, on December 
12, 1953, while he was a member of the Senate of the Philippines, an alleged 
deed of donation—copy of which is annexed to the petition—of the four (4) 
parcels of land constituting said projected feeder roads, in favor of the 
Government of the Republic of the Philippines; that said alleged deed of 
donation was, on the same date, accepted by the then Executive Secretary; that 
being-subject to an onerous condition, said donation partook of the nature of a 
contract; that, as such, said donation violated the provision of our fundamental 
law prohibiting members of Congress from being directly or indirectly 
financially interested in any contract with the Government, and, hence, is 
unconstitutional, as well as null and void <em>ab initio</em>, for the 
construction of the projected feeder roads in question with public funds would 
greatly enhance or increase the value of the aforementioned subdivision of 
respondent Zulueta, "aside from relieving him from the burden of constructing 
his subdivision streets or roads at his own expense"; that the construction of 
said projected feeder roads was then being undertaken by the Bureau of Public 
Highways; and that, unless restrained by the court, the respondents would 
continue to execute, comply with, follow and implement the aforementioned 
illegal provision of law, "to the irreparable damage, detriment and prejudice 
not only to the petitioner but to the Filipino nation."</p>
<p>Petitioner prayed, therefore, that the contested item of Republic Act No. 920 
be declared null and void; that the alleged deed of donation of the feeder roads 
in question be "declared unconstitutional and, therefore, illegal"; that a writ 
of injunction be issued enjoining the Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, the Director of the Bureau of Public Works, the Commissioner of 
the Bureau of Public Highways and Jose C. Zulueta from ordering or allowing the 
continuance of the above-mentioned feeder roads project, and from making and 
securing any new and further releases on the aforementioned item of Republic Act 
No. 920, and the disbursing officers of the Department of Public Works and 
Communications, the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Public Highways 
from making any further payments out of said funds provided for in Republic Act 
No. 920; and that pending final hearing on the merits, a writ of preliminary 
injunction be issued enjoining the aforementioned parties respondent from making 
and securing any new and further releases on the aforesaid item of Republic Act 
No. 920 and from making any further payments out of said illegally appropriated 
funds.</p>
<p>Respondents moved to dismiss the petition upon the ground that petitioner had 
"no legal capacity to sue", and that the petition did "not state a cause of 
action". In support to this motion, respondent Zulueta alleged that the 
Provincial Fiscal of Rizal, not its provincial governor, should represent the 
Province of Rizal, pursuant to section 1683 of the Revised Administrative Code; 
that said respondent is "not aware of any law which makes illegal the 
appropriation of public funds for the improvement of * * * private property"; 
and that,, the constitutional provision invoked by petitioner is inapplicable to 
the donation in question, the same being a pure act of liberality, not a 
contract. The other respondents, in turn, maintained that petitioner could not 
assail the appropriation in question because "there is no actual <em>bona 
fide</em> case * * * in which the validity of Republic Act No. 920 is 
necessarily involved" and petitioner "has not shown that he has a personal and 
substantial interest" in said Act "and that its enforcement has caused or will 
cause him a direct injury".</p>
<p>Acting upon said motions to dismiss, the lower court rendered the 
aforementioned decision, dated October 29, 1953, holding that, since public 
interest is involved in this case, the Provincial Governor of Rizal and the 
provincial fiscal thereof who represents him therein, "have the requisite 
personalities" to question the constitutionality of the disputed item of 
Republic Act No. 920; that "the legislature is without power to appropriate 
public revenues for anything but a public purpose", that the construction and 
improvement of the feeder roads in question, if such roads were private 
property, would not be a public purpose; that, being subject to the following 
condition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The within donation is hereby made <em>upon the condition that the 
Government of the Republic of the Philippines will use the parcels of land 
liereby donated for street purposes only and for no other purposes 
whatsoever</em>; it being expressly understood that should the Government of the 
Kepuhlic of the Philippines violate the condition hereby imposed upon it, the 
title to the land hereby donated shall, upon such violation, <em>ipso facto</em> 
revert to the Donor, Jose C. Zulueta." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>which is onerous, the donation in question is a contract; that said donation 
or contract is "absolutely forbidden by the Constitution" and consequently 
"illegal", for Article 1409 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, declares 
inexistent and void from the very beginning contracts "whose cause, object or 
purpose is contrary to law, morals * * * or public policy"; that the legality of 
said donation may not be contested, however, by petitioner herein because his 
"interests are not directly affected" thereby and that, accordingly, the 
appropriation in question "should be upheld" and the case dismissed.</p>
<p>At the outset, it should be noted that we are concerned with a decision 
granting the aforementioned motions to dismiss, which as such, are deemed to 
have admitted hypothetically the allegations of fact made in the petition of 
appellant herein. According to said petition, respondent Zulueta is the owner of 
several parcels of residential land, situated in Pasig, Rizal, and known as the 
Antonio Subdivision, certain portions of which had been reserved for the 
projected feeder roads aforementioned, which, admittedly, were private property 
of said respondent when Republic Act No. 920, appropriating P85.000.00 for the 
"construction, reconstruction, repair, extension and improvement" of said roads, 
was passed by Congress, as well as when it was approved by the President on June 
20, 1953. The petition further alleges that the construction of said feeder 
roads, to be undertaken with the aforementioned appropriation of P85,000.00, 
would have the effect of relieving respondent Zulueta of the burden of 
constructing his subdivision streets or roads at his own expenses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and would "greatly enhance or increase the 
value of the subdivision" of said respondent. The lower court held that under 
these circumstances, the appropriation in question was "clearly for a private, 
not a public purpose."</p>
<p>Respondents do not deny the accuracy of this conclusion, which is 
self-evident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> However, respondent 
Zulueta contended, in his motion to dismiss that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A law passed by Congress and approved by the President can never be illegal 
because Congress is the source of all laws * * *. Aside from the fact that the 
movant is not aware of any law which makes illegal the appropriatoin of public 
funds for the improvement of what we, in the meantime, may assume as private 
property * * *." (Record on Appeal, p. 33.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The first proposition must be rejected most emphatically, it being 
inconsistent with the nature of the Government established under the 
Constitution of the Philippines and the system of checks and balances underlying 
our political structure. Moreover, it is refuted by the decisions of this Court 
invalidating legislative enactments deemed violative of the Constitution or 
organic laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>As regards the legal feasibility of appropriating public funds for a private 
purpose, the principle according to Ruling Case Law, is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is a general rule that <em>the legislature is without power to 
appropriate public revenue for anything but a public purpose</em>. * * * It is 
the essential character of the <em>direct</em> object of the expenditure which 
must determine its validity as justifying a tax, and not the magnitude of the 
interests to be affected nor the degree to which the general advantage of the 
community, and thus the public welfare, may be ultimately benefited by their 
promotion. <em>Incidental</em> advantage to the public or to the state, which 
results from the promotion of private interests and the prosperity of private 
enterprises or business, does <em>not</em> justify their aid by the use of 
public money." (25 R.L.C. pp. 398-400; Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The rule is set forth in Corpus Juris Secundum in the following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In accordance with the rule that the <em>taxing power must be exercised for 
public purposes only</em>, discussed <em>supra</em> sec. 14, money raised by 
taxation can be expended <em>only for public purposes</em> and <em>not for the 
advantage of private individuals</em>." (85 C.J.S. pp. 645-646; italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Explaining the reason underlying said rule, Corpus Juris Secundum states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Generally, under the express or implied provisions of the constitution, 
<em>public funds may be used only for a public purpose</em>. The right of the 
legislature to appropriate funds is <em>correlative with its right to tax</em>, 
and, under constitutional provisions against taxation except for public purposes 
and prohibiting: the collection of a tax for one purpose and the devotion 
thereof to another purpose, <em>no appropriation of state funds can be made for 
other than a public purpose</em>. * * *</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"The test of the constitutionality of a statute requiring the use of public 
funds is whether the statute is designed to promote the public interests, as 
opposed to the furtherance of the advantage of individuals, although each 
advantage to individuals might <em>incidentally</em> serve the public. * * * ." 
(81 C.J.S. p. 1147; italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, this Court is fully in accord with the foregoing views 
which, apart from being patently sound, are a necessary corollary to our 
democratic system of government, which, as such,, exists primarily for the 
promotion of the general welfare. Besides, reflecting as they do, the 
established jurisprudence in the United States, after whose constitutional 
system ours has been patterned, said views and jurisprudence are, likewise, part 
and parcel of our own constitutional law.</p>
<p>This notwithstanding, the lower court felt constrained to uphold the 
appropriation in question, upon the ground that petitioner may not contest the 
legality of the donation above referred to because the same does not affect him 
directly. This conclusion is, presumably, based upon the following premises, 
namely: (1) that, if valid, said donation cured the constitutional infirmity of 
the aforementioned appropriation; (2) that the latter may not be annulled 
without a previous declaration of unconstitutionality of the said donation; and 
(3) that the rule set forth in Article 1421 of the Civil Code is absolute, and 
admits of no exception. We do not agree with these premises.</p>
<p>The validity of a statute depends upon the powers of Congress at the time of 
its passage or approval, not upon events occurring, or acts performed, 
<em>subsequently</em> thereto, unless the latter consist of an amendment of the 
organic law, removing, with retrospective operation, the constitutional 
limitation infringed by said statute. Referring to the P85,000.00 appropriation 
for the projected feeder roads in question, the legality thereof depended upon 
whether said roads were public or private property when the bill, which, later 
on, became Republic Act No. 920, was passed by Congress, or, when said bill was 
approved by the President and the disbursement of said sum became effective, or 
on June 20, 1953 (see section 13 of said Act). Inasmuch as the land on which the 
projected feeder roads were to be constructed belonged then to respondent 
Zulueta, the result is that said appropriation sought a private purpose, and, 
hence, was null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The donation 
to the Government, over five (5) months <em>after</em> the approval and 
effectivity of said Act, made, according to the petition, for the purpose of 
giving a "semblance of legality", or legalizing, the appropriation in question, 
did not cure its aforementioned basic defect. Consequently, a judicial 
nullification of said donation need not precede the declaration of 
unconstitutionality of said appropriation.</p>
<p>Again, Article 1421 of our Civil Code, like many other statutory enactments, 
is subject to exceptions. For instance, the creditors of a party to an illegal 
contract may, under the conditions set forth in Article 1177 of said Code, 
exercise the rights and actions of the latter, except only those which are 
inherent in his person, including, therefore, his right to the annulment of said 
contract, even though such creditors are not affected by the same, except 
indirectly, in the manner indicated in said legal provision</p>
<p>Again, it is well settled that the validity of a statuia may be contested 
only by one who will sustain a direct injury in consequence of its enforcement. 
Yet, there are many decisions nullifying, at the instance of taxpayers, laws 
providing for the disbursement of public funds,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> upon the theory that "the expenditure of 
public funds by an officer of the State for the purpose of administering an 
<em>unconstitutional act</em> constitutes a <em>misapplication</em> of such 
funds," which may be enjoined at the request of a taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Although there are some decisions to the 
contrary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the prevailing view in the 
United States is stated in the American Jurisprudence as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the determination of the degree of interest essential to give the 
requisite standing to attack the constitutionality of a statute the general rule 
is that not only persons individually affected, but <em>also taxpayers, have 
sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of moneys raised by 
taxation and may therefore question llw constitutionality of statutes requiring 
expenditure of public moneys.</em>" (11 Am. Jur. 761; italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>However, this view was not favored by the Supreme Court of the U.S. in 
Frothingham <em>vs</em>. Mellon (262 U.S. 447), insofar as <em>federal</em> laws 
are concerned, upon the ground that the relationship of a taxpayer of the U.S. 
to its Federal Government is different from that of a taxpayer of a municipal 
corporation to its government. Indeed, under the <em>composite</em> system of 
government existing in the U.S., the states of the Union are integral part of 
the Federation from an <em>international</em> viewpoint, but, each state enjoys 
internally a substantial measure of sovereignty, subject to the limitations 
imposed by the Federal Constitution. In fact, the same was made by 
representatives of <em>each state</em> of the Union, not of the people of the 
U.S., except insofar as the former represented the people of the respective 
States, and the people of each State has, independently of that of the others, 
ratified said Constitution. In other words, the Federal Constitution and the 
Federal statutes have become binding upon the people of the U.S. in consequence 
of an act of, and, in this sense, <em>through</em> the respective states of the 
Union of which they are citizens. The peculiar nature of the relation between 
said people and the Federal Government of the U.S. is reflected in the election 
of its President, who is chosen directly, <em>not</em> by the people of the 
U.S., but by electors chosen by <em>each State</em>, in such manner as the 
legislature thereof may direct (Article II, section 2, of the Federal 
Constitution).</p>
<p>The relation between the people of the Philippines and its taxpayers, on the 
one hand, and the Republic of the Philippines, on the other, is not identical to 
that obtaining between the people and taxpayers of the U.S. and its Federal 
Government. It is closer, from a domestic viewpoint, to that existing between 
the people and taxpayers of each state and the government thereof, except that 
the authority of the Republic of the Philippines over the people of the 
Philippines is <em>more fully direct</em> than that of the states of the Union, 
insofar as the <em>simple</em> and <em>unitary</em> type of our national 
government is not subject to limitations analogous to those imposed by the 
Federal Constitution upon the states of the Union, and those imposed upon the 
Federal Government in the interest of the states of the Union. For this reason, 
the rule recognizing the right of taxpayers to assail the constitutionality of a 
legislation appropriating local or state public funds—which has been upheld by 
the Federal Supreme Court (Crampton <em>vs</em>. Zabriskie, 101 U.S. 601) — has 
greater application in the Philippines than that adopted with respect to acts of 
Congress of the United States appropriating federal funds.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the Province of Tayabas <em>vs</em>. Perez (56 Phil., 257), 
involving the expropriation of a land by the Province of Tayabas, two (2) 
taxpayers thereof were allowed to intervene for the purpose of contesting the 
price being paid to the owner thereof, as unduly exhorbitant. It is true that in 
Custodio <em>vs</em>. President of the Senate (42 Off. Gaz., 1243), a taxpayer 
and employee of the Government was not permitted to question the 
constitutionality of an appropriation for backpay of members of Congress. 
However, in Rodriguez <em>vs</em>. Treasurer of the Philippines and Barredo 
<em>vs</em>. Commission on Elections (84 Phil., 368; 45 Off. Gaz., 4411), we 
entertained the action of taxpayers impugning the validity of certain 
appropriations of public funds, and invalidated the same. Moreover, the reason 
that impelled this Court to take such position in said two (2) cases—the 
importance of the issues therein raised—is present in the case at bar. Again, 
like the petitioners in the Rodriguez and Barredo cases, petitioner herein is 
not merely a taxpayer. The Province of Rizal, which he represents officially as 
its Provincial Governor, is our most populated political subdivision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and, the taxpayers therein bear a 
substantial portion of the burden of taxation, in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Hence, it is our considered opinion that the circumstances surrounding this 
case sufficiently justify petitioner's action in contesting the appropriation 
and donation in question; that this action should not have been dismissed by the 
lower court; and that the writ of preliminary injunction should have been 
maintained.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed, and the records are 
remanded to the lower court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this 
decision, with the costs of this instance against respondent Jose C. Zulueta. It 
is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed, records remanded to lower court for further 
proceedings.</em></p>
