				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 7 March 1955 the Kapisanan Ñg Mga Manggagawa sa Manila Railroad Company filed a petition in the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; under section&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; Republic Act No. 875, alleging that it is one of the eight labor organizations&nbsp; with which the employees&nbsp; and&nbsp; workers of the Manila Railroad Company are affiliated; that within twelve months prior to the filing of the petition, no&nbsp; certification or election has been made or ordered by the Court designating or selecting the labor organization that will act as the exclusive&nbsp; collective bargaining representative of the employees and&nbsp; workers&nbsp; of the said Company; and that in view of the existence of eight labor&nbsp; organizations in the same&nbsp; Company, there is a necessity for designating or selecting the labor organization&nbsp; for the purpose stated. It prayed that after investigation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court certify to the parties in writing the name of the collective bargaining representative designated&nbsp; or&nbsp; chosen&nbsp; from among the eight labor organizations of employees and laborers working in the Company or, if there be any doubt as&nbsp; to whom they had chosen&nbsp; as&nbsp; their representative for&nbsp; the purpose of collective bargaining, the Court order that a&nbsp; certification&nbsp; election be held by the employees&nbsp; and workers for the purpose of selecting their&nbsp; collective bargaining representative (Case No. 237-MC, Annex A). <br><br>On&nbsp; 18 March 1955 the Manila Railroad Labor Federation filed&nbsp; an answer claiming that&nbsp; it is the only&nbsp; labor organization or the appropriate union, and not any of the eight&nbsp; labor&nbsp; organizations named&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner union, that can legally act for all or for the members&nbsp; of the union concerned as&nbsp; the exclusive collective bargaining&nbsp; representative of the employees&nbsp; and laborers working in the Company;&nbsp; that there is no urgent&nbsp; need-for holding a&nbsp; certification election because there are no pending demands from the employees and workers; that the petitioner union is represented by one who is ineligible to become a member of&nbsp; that union because of the supervisory nature&nbsp; of the position he holds in the Company; that the petitioner union being a member of the Manila Railroad Labor Federation is estopped from demanding that&nbsp; it be designated as the exclusive bargaining representative of the, employees and workers; and that should the Court order the holding of a certification election, the Federation be recognized as the collective bargaining unit to represent at such election&nbsp; all the employees and workers affiliated with it through&nbsp; its different labor&nbsp; union members.&nbsp; The Federation prayed that the petition or certification election be denied, or if it should be granted, that it be allowed to participate in the election as&nbsp; a unit representing the employees and workers of the Company (Annex B). <br><br>On 23&nbsp; March&nbsp; 1955 the Manila Railroad Company filed an&nbsp; answer claiming that a large number of its employees and workers&nbsp; are&nbsp; "supervisors" within&nbsp; the meaning&nbsp; of section 2(k), Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 875,&nbsp; who&nbsp; are ineligible for membership in a labor organization of employees like the petitioner union and the others existing in the Company and cannot participate&nbsp; and&nbsp; vote&nbsp; at such election,&nbsp; pursuant to section 3 of the same Act/that Vicente K. Olazo, 'president of the&nbsp; petitioner union, who subscribed the petition or certification, is assistant chief, signal &amp; electrical division of the Company, a supervisor, and for that reason he&nbsp; is ineligible&nbsp; for membership in the petitioner union that the supervisors ineligible for membership in the different labor organizations existing in the Company should first be ascertained and&nbsp; segregated to prevent them from participating&nbsp; and&nbsp; voting&nbsp; at the&nbsp; "certification election" prayed for; that a majority of the members of the petitioner union is&nbsp; also affiliated with other&nbsp; labor organizations;&nbsp; that&nbsp; while the petitioner union claims&nbsp; to have a membership of 3,014, it cannot be taken as&nbsp; a conclusive&nbsp; proof that they all&nbsp; desire to be represented by the petitioner union for purposes of collective bargaining with the Company; and that&nbsp; under the circumstances, the question as&nbsp; to who should be the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; collective bargaining representative of all the employees and workers could only be&nbsp; determined&nbsp; by&nbsp; holding&nbsp; a certification&nbsp; election;&nbsp; It prayed that the petition for certification election be denied; that,&nbsp; in&nbsp; lieu thereof, the supervisors ineligible&nbsp; for&nbsp; membership in the various labor organizations be ascertained; and that after such ascertainment if the Court be of the opinion&nbsp; that a&nbsp; certification election&nbsp; is still necessary it order, the holding thereof (Annex:C).<br><br>On 11 May 1955 the petitioner union filed&nbsp; a reply to the answer of the Federation denying that there are no pending&nbsp; labor demands submitted by it&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Company, the, truth being that they have not yet been satisfactorily settled and are the subject of pending 'negotiations,&nbsp; and that the position its president is&nbsp; holding in the Company is supervisory in nature; and claiming that since 6 March 1955&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; union has severed its connection with the Federation, and cannot be compelled to continue its affiliation with the Federation and be bound by the resolution of 16 March 1954 to which it was not a party; that as the Federation&nbsp; is a company controlled and dominated union it has forfeited its right, if any, to be certified as the collective bargaining representative&nbsp; of the&nbsp; employees and workers; and that in a secret ballot election the seven unions allegedly composing the Federation cannot be joined to form a unit for the purpose of being certified as&nbsp; a collective bargaining representative but&nbsp; should&nbsp; be considered as separate individual unions.&nbsp; It prayed that the Federation be declared disqualified to be certified as a collective bargaining representative of the&nbsp; employees&nbsp; and&nbsp; workers or to participate in the secret ballot election&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; D). <br><br>After&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; on 29&nbsp; September&nbsp; 1956 the Court held that&nbsp; Vicente K.&nbsp; Olazo who&nbsp; is&nbsp; holding the position of assistant electrical and signal superintendent in the Company, is a supervisor ineligible for&nbsp; membership&nbsp; in the petitioner&nbsp; union, and rendered judgment as follows:<br><blockquote>1. The locomotive drivers, firemen, assistant firemen and motormen of the Company are&nbsp; hereby declared a separate appropriate collective&nbsp; bargaining unit&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Union de&nbsp; Maquiriistas,&nbsp; Pogoneros, Ayudantes y Motormen is certified as their exclusive representative for collective bargaining purposes; <br><br>2. The conductors, assistant&nbsp; conductors,&nbsp; route agents,&nbsp; assistant route agents, and train porters, are, also hereby declared, a separate appropriate&nbsp; collective&nbsp; bargaining unitpurposes&nbsp; (?);. and <br><br>3. The rest of the&nbsp; Company's personnel, except the supervisors, the temporary employees, the members of the Auditing Department the members Of the security-group", and the professional and technical employees hereinabove' enumerated, are hereby&nbsp; declareda separate&nbsp; collective bargaining&nbsp; unit and the Kapisanan&nbsp; ng&nbsp; Mga Manggagawa sa Manila&nbsp; Railroad&nbsp; Company is hereby certified&nbsp; as their exclusive&nbsp; representative&nbsp; for collective bargaining purposes. (Annex E.)&nbsp; </blockquote>The petitioner'"filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision&nbsp; by the Court<i> in banc</i> . In its motion it specifically sought&nbsp; a reconsideration of, the decision—<br><blockquote>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * only&nbsp; insofar as&nbsp; it holds&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; K.&nbsp; Olazo, president&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner union, a supervisor within the meaning of&nbsp; Section 2(k)&nbsp; y of Republic Act,No. 875, on the ground that said ruling&nbsp; is contrary to the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; proven at the hearings as well as to, the letter, intent and&nbsp; purpose of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 875.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annex F.)<br></blockquote>The petitioner filed a memorandum&nbsp; in support of its motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; (Annex F-l).&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 16 January 1957, the&nbsp; Court, sitting&nbsp; <i>in banc</i> denied the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Three associate&nbsp;&nbsp; judges&nbsp; voted&nbsp; to&nbsp; deny&nbsp; while the&nbsp; presiding judge and one associate judge voted to grant the&nbsp; motion to reconsider the part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; already stated (Annexes G &amp; G-l).&nbsp; The petitioner has appealed. <br><br>In&nbsp; its notice&nbsp; of appeal,&nbsp; it&nbsp; stated that&nbsp; it appeals — <br><blockquote>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * from the Resolution of the&nbsp; Court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> dated January 16, 1957&nbsp; denying&nbsp; petitioner's motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration of&nbsp; the decision of the trial Court dated September 29,1956, which resolution was received by petitioner on May 7, 1957, to the Honorable Supreme Court through a petition for review by certiorari; within the statutory&nbsp; period, on the ground that said&nbsp; resolution and decision&nbsp; are contrary to law.&nbsp; (Annex H.)<br></blockquote>This petition for&nbsp; review&nbsp; is&nbsp; only&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; with the case of Vicente K.&nbsp; Olazo. <br><br>Section 3, Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875, provides:<br><blockquote>Employees shall have the right to self-organization and to form, join&nbsp; or assist labor organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of collective bargaining through representatives of their own&nbsp; choosing and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining and other mutual aid&nbsp; or protection.&nbsp; Individuals employed as supervisors shall not be eligible for membership&nbsp; in a&nbsp; labor organization of employees under their&nbsp; supervision but may form separate organizations&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; own.<br></blockquote>Section 2, clause (k), defines the term "supervisor" as—<br><blockquote>* *&nbsp; *&nbsp; any person having authority in&nbsp; the&nbsp; interest of an employer, to hire, transfer, suspend,&nbsp; lay-off, recall,&nbsp; discharge,&nbsp; assign, recommend,&nbsp; or discipline&nbsp; other employees, or responsibly to direct them, and&nbsp; to adjust their grievances,&nbsp; or&nbsp; effectively&nbsp; to recommend such acts&nbsp; if, in connection&nbsp; with the&nbsp; foregoing,&nbsp; the exercise&nbsp; of such authority is not of a merely routinary or clerical nature but requires the&nbsp; use of independent judgment.<br></blockquote>With respect to Vicente K. Olazo,&nbsp; the Court found and held as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>Let us now take&nbsp; the case of Vicente K. Olazo, president of the petitioner union. Since&nbsp; 1946,&nbsp; he has&nbsp; been occupying the&nbsp; position of assistant&nbsp; electrical&nbsp; and signal superintendent and as&nbsp; such, he is the&nbsp; assistant head&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; signal&nbsp; and electrical division.&nbsp; He receives a salary of P4,500.00 per annum.<br><br>Joaquin&nbsp; Romillo, Chief&nbsp; Engineer and&nbsp; head&nbsp; of the&nbsp; engineering department to which the electrical and signal division belongs, testified&nbsp; that Olazo has&nbsp; around&nbsp; sixty men under him in the said division; that he (Olazo)&nbsp; can recommend the promotion&nbsp; and the disciplining of his subordinates and such&nbsp; recommendation&nbsp; carries&nbsp; considerable weight; that he can assign work and effectively direct the work of his subordinates; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; acts as Superintendent in the&nbsp; absence of the latter and in fact he has acted more or less tea times&nbsp; as such during the&nbsp; last three years. <br><br>Geronimo Genilo, electrical and signal superintendent, and immediate superior of Olazo,&nbsp; identified the&nbsp; signatures appearing&nbsp; in Exhs. "10-Co." to "10-11-Co." to be that of Olazo and stated&nbsp; that he has given the&nbsp; standing&nbsp; authority to Olazo&nbsp; to issue the same.&nbsp; These exhibits appear to be&nbsp; "work, orders" directed to his&nbsp; subordinates and&nbsp; signed by Olazo in his capacity as assistant superintendent. <br><br>On the&nbsp; witness stand,&nbsp; Olazo&nbsp; denied&nbsp; that he has the power to recommend the disciplining, promotion or transfer of any employee under&nbsp; him or that&nbsp; he could effectively&nbsp; direct&nbsp; the work of&nbsp; his subordinates. <br><br>The&nbsp; work of Olazo can be seen&nbsp; in&nbsp; Exh.&nbsp; "8-4-Company" which is the&nbsp; "Job Description Questionnaire"&nbsp; prepared and submitted by him&nbsp; to the Wage and' Position&nbsp; Classification Office of&nbsp; the Budget Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the item "Statement&nbsp; of&nbsp; Duties",&nbsp; it appears&nbsp; that 50% of his working lame&nbsp; is used "to assist the Signal and Communication&nbsp; (now&nbsp; Electrical)&nbsp; Superintendent to&nbsp; maintain a sound and efficient Communications,&nbsp; (Telegraph and Telephone)&nbsp; signal, and switches including crossing gates for safe operation&nbsp; of trains, and to maintain good electrical installations; 25% "to execute orders designated by the Superintendent especially for the inspection of communication lines,&nbsp; switches,&nbsp; signals, ' crossing&nbsp; gates&nbsp; and&nbsp; electrical installations&nbsp; throughout&nbsp; the&nbsp; line";&nbsp; 20%&nbsp; to take&nbsp; charge of&nbsp; the division and do the&nbsp; work&nbsp; of the superintendent in case&nbsp; latter is on sick&nbsp; or vacation&nbsp; leave";&nbsp;&nbsp; and the remaining 15%&nbsp; to&nbsp; "other office routinary work". <br><br>In the item "names or&nbsp; titles of those you supervise&nbsp; (if more than seven (7),&nbsp; list only the&nbsp; numbers&nbsp; and titles&nbsp; of those you supervise)", Olazo wrote&nbsp; the&nbsp; following: "Lineman&nbsp; Supervisors and their men, Jr. Communication&nbsp; Engineer and his men&nbsp; and Junior Signal Engineers and&nbsp; his men". <br><br>This document was prepared by him on July 15,&nbsp; 1955, i.e., during the&nbsp; pendency&nbsp; of&nbsp; this case, and the same was&nbsp; certified as correct by his immediate superior, Geronimo Genilo, and by the Chief Engineer, Joaquin&nbsp; Romillo,&nbsp; who&nbsp; is&nbsp; the head&nbsp; of&nbsp; the engineering&nbsp; department. These two immediate superiors of Olazo also testified that the same duties are still exercised&nbsp; by&nbsp; him at present.<br><br>It is, however, contended by&nbsp; the. petitioner that by&nbsp; virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; a memorandum&nbsp; dated July 6, 1954 issued by the chief engineer, Romillo, to the division engineers, road master, superintendent of buildings and&nbsp; bridges and the electrical and&nbsp; signal superintendent (Exhibits "R"&nbsp; and&nbsp; "R-1"-, the supervision&nbsp; and&nbsp; control of the linemen&nbsp; and linemen supervisors, originally under the signal and electrical division is now being undertaken&nbsp; by&nbsp; the division engineers, leaving to the electrical and&nbsp; signal division only the&nbsp; planning, programming&nbsp; and research.&nbsp; On the other hand, Romillo pointed out in his testimony that the memorandum&nbsp; mentioned by the petitioner affected&nbsp; only the "field&nbsp; men" which&nbsp; refers to linemen and&nbsp; linemen&nbsp; supervisors but not the signal men, electricians, and electrical supervisors&nbsp; who still remain under the&nbsp; control and supervision of the&nbsp; signal&nbsp; and electrical, division.&nbsp; Romillo further testified that the said memorandum was&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by him to coordinate the work of, the signal and electrical division with&nbsp; that&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Division Engineers and Roadmaster&nbsp; and that said division was&nbsp; not completely deprived of its supervision over&nbsp; the linemen and linemen supervisors. <br><br>We are inclined&nbsp; to believe this testimony because of what Mr. Olazo himself wrote in. Exh. "8-4-Company" to the effect that he (Olazo) has supervision,&nbsp; among others, over the "linemen supervisors&nbsp; and their men".&nbsp; The said exhibit was&nbsp; prepared by Olazo very much later than the issuance of the memorandum (Exh. "R"). <br><br>No valid reason has&nbsp; been, presented why we, ought to discredit the testimony of Messrs.&nbsp; Romillo and Genilo,&nbsp; In fact, it appears that the latter&nbsp; is also&nbsp; a member of the&nbsp; petitioner union. Under the circumstances,&nbsp; we conclude that&nbsp; Vicente K. Olazo is a&nbsp; supervisor.<br></blockquote>After a careful study of the facts as found by the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations,&nbsp; we&nbsp; find no&nbsp; reason&nbsp; for disturbing the conclusion drawn therefrom. <br><br>The part of the judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the&nbsp; petitioner. <br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia, Barerra,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
