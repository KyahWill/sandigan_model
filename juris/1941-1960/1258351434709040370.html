				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Victoriano Francisco y Martin appeals from a judgment of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila finding&nbsp; him guilty, of estafa and sentencing him to&nbsp; an indeterminate term of from 4 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> to 1 year and 8 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision&nbsp; correctional</span> and to pay an indemnity of P2,525&nbsp; to Naric, with subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment in case of insolvency. As only questions of law are raised in the appeal, the case has been certified&nbsp; to us by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals.<br><br>It appears that on September 17,1947 one Tomas Catitis appeared at a barbershop on&nbsp; Pureza Street, Sta. Mesa, where appellant was working as a barber and asked the latter to help him bring out 100&nbsp; sacks&nbsp; of&nbsp; rice from the Naric compound.&nbsp; Catitis told appellant that the latter was to sign the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; "M.&nbsp; de Guzman" on a. sales invoice or receipt (Exhibit B) before an employee of the Narie and thereby help bring&nbsp; out the rice&nbsp; therefrom. Catitis was to&nbsp; accompany appellant&nbsp; and give him instructions on what to do.&nbsp; He promised to pay appellant compensation for thus securing&nbsp; the rice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant agreed, so he and Catitis went to the Naric compound.&nbsp; There appellant presented the sales invoice, Exhibit B, before&nbsp; a clerk and in the&nbsp; latter's presence signed the name "M.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Guzman" thereon on the blank for&nbsp; the signature&nbsp; of the purchaser or his agent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The invoice was then brought by them to another employee&nbsp; who prepared a trucking, receipt, Exhibit C.&nbsp; Appellant&nbsp; again&nbsp; signed&nbsp; M. de Guzman on the blank for the driver.&nbsp; A gate&nbsp; pass, Exhibit D, was also prepared on which appellant&nbsp; again signed the name of M. de Guzman. With these accomplished, the 100 sacks of rice&nbsp; were delivered to appellant who took the same in a truck.<br><br>Appellant's contention is that the invoice Exhibit B, in the name of M. de&nbsp; Guzman, was&nbsp; already paid for and only lacked the signature of&nbsp; M. de Guzman, when he signed the latter's name;&nbsp; and that there is no sufficient proof of the existence of deceit or of intent to cause damage, both essential&nbsp; elements of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of&nbsp; estafa&nbsp; as&nbsp; appellant merely&nbsp; complied with the&nbsp; instructions of&nbsp; Catitis.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; also claimed that appellant merely followed the instructions of Catitis as agreed upon in all good faith, not to defraud the&nbsp; Naric&nbsp; for his benefit&nbsp; (evidently because&nbsp; the rice was already fully paid for).<br><br>Exhibit&nbsp; B, besides being an invoice of the sale of 100 sacks of rice, is also a receipt therefor.&nbsp; The buyer's&nbsp; name is Mario de Guzman.&nbsp;&nbsp; It contains above the signed name of M. de Guzman, a statement that the signer has "received the&nbsp; above&nbsp; articles in good&nbsp; condition."&nbsp;&nbsp; When, therefore, appellant signed M. de Guzman's name in the receipt, the import or meaning of his act of signing was that he himself was M. de Guzman,&nbsp; the buyer&nbsp; of the rice mentioned in the receipt. Appellant may&nbsp; not have&nbsp; told&nbsp; the&nbsp; Naric warehouseman that he was M. de Guzman himself, but his act&nbsp; of signing De Guzman's name&nbsp; on the receipt carried an implied&nbsp; representation on his part that he was M.&nbsp; de Guzman, the buyer of the rice.&nbsp; This fact, together with his failure to disclose his real name and person, constitutes the&nbsp; deceit through which the rice was obtained.<br><br>Appellant's contention&nbsp; that there&nbsp; was no proof of criminal intent, because he testified without contradiction that he only followed Catitis instructions and no proof of said intent was&nbsp; adduced by the prosecution, is without merit. Appellant's act in signing somebody else's name, without permission&nbsp; or&nbsp; authority&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; person&nbsp; concerned,&nbsp; to secure rice that belonged to the latter is a&nbsp; criminal act, even if&nbsp; done upon instruction's&nbsp; of another, because&nbsp; he thereby deceitfully represented himself as the person whose name he signed. As the act is criminal, criminal intent is presumed.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rule 123, section 69[<i>b</i>].)<br><br>The claim that there was no proof of&nbsp; damage to the Naric because the rice was fully paid for is also without merit.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the real buyer, M. de Guzman, was not the one who received the 100 sacks of rice paid for, the Naric was still liable to deliver the&nbsp; said 100 sacks&nbsp; of rice to M.&nbsp; de Guzman.&nbsp; The rice given to appellant and his confederate was thus lost to Naric&nbsp; and&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; the element&nbsp; of damage in the offense of estafa committed.<br><br>The judgment of conviction is hereby affirmed, although the penalty imposed therein is&nbsp; modified in the sense that the minimum of the penalty imposed should be four months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> instead of four months&nbsp; and&nbsp; one day. With costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Par√°s, C. J.,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L,</i> and <i>Endencia,</i> <span style="font-style: italic;">JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
