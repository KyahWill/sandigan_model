				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present controversy involves a&nbsp; parcel of land situated in Baguio City.&nbsp; It was sold to "Schober Brothers" by one Alfredo Mendoza.&nbsp; As a result of the sale, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1555 was issued to "Schober Brothers."<br><br>The City Treasurer of Baguio&nbsp; assessed the&nbsp; land in the name of&nbsp; "Schober Brothers", and taxes thereon were paid up to the year 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; record shows&nbsp; that the&nbsp; taxes for 1947&nbsp; and 1948&nbsp; were paid by one J.&nbsp; B. Hoover, ancillary administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of William J. Schober.&nbsp; As the 1949 tax was not paid within the&nbsp; time&nbsp; required by law, the city treasurer wrote the "Schober Brothers", care of Mr. Hoover, a&nbsp; letter&nbsp; dated October 25, 1949 advising it that the tax had not&nbsp; been paid. On March 20,&nbsp; 1950, the treasurer sent another letter to said firm,&nbsp; care of Mr. Hoover, advising&nbsp; that the land was being advertised for sale at public auction on April 3, 4, arid 5,&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tax remained unpaid and the city treasurer,&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 3, 1950,&nbsp; after publishing a notice of sale on&nbsp; March 4,&nbsp; 11, and 18, 1950 in the Philippines Herald&nbsp; and posting such notice as required by law, sold the land for P218.13&nbsp; to Delfin S.&nbsp; Sian as the highest&nbsp; bidder.<br><br>The property&nbsp; was not&nbsp; redeemed&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; one year period allowed by law for redemption,&nbsp; and the city treasurer executed a final deed of sale of the property.&nbsp; This was annotated on the back of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1555 on&nbsp; file with the Register&nbsp; of Deeds of&nbsp; Baguio City.&nbsp;&nbsp; On April&nbsp; 13, 1951, the register&nbsp; of deeds required the "Schober Brothers" to surrender&nbsp; the owner's duplicate certificate in its possession, but apparently the request was unheeded.&nbsp; On April 17, 1951, Sian&nbsp; filed a petition with the Court of First Instance of Baguio in G.L.R.O. Record No. 211 praying for the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1555 and the issuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; a new one&nbsp; in his name. J. B. Hoover, in behalf of the "Schober Brothers", was notified of this proceeding by registered mail, but the notice was returned unclaimed.&nbsp; On May 3,1951, the court issued an order granting the petition.&nbsp; Copy of the order was also sent by&nbsp; registered mail to Hoover, but the notice was likewise returned unclaimed.&nbsp; The order having become&nbsp; final, the register of deeds cancelled Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1555 and issued Certificate of&nbsp; Title No. 1575&nbsp; in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of Sian on&nbsp; the back of which&nbsp; an annotation was entered relative to a writ of attachment issued in Civil Case No. 53650 of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; Stanley&nbsp; L. Kidder <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; William&nbsp; J. Schober.<br><br>On&nbsp; July 1, 1949, Sian sold the land&nbsp; to Francisco Rodrigo and his wife for&nbsp; P21,000.00, but the&nbsp; latter did not deliver the entire purchase&nbsp; price, as&nbsp; they&nbsp; withheld P10,000.00 pending cancellation of the annotation&nbsp; of the attachment on the title, which Sian in due time undertook to secure from&nbsp; the&nbsp; court.&nbsp; This&nbsp; annotation&nbsp; was&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; cancelled because it was shown that the record of the case wherein the writ&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued had not been reconstituted,&nbsp; the time limit&nbsp; set&nbsp; by&nbsp; law to do&nbsp; so having&nbsp; expired&nbsp; on June&nbsp; 7, 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that when the Rodrigo&nbsp; spouses registered the land in their&nbsp; name, the&nbsp; new&nbsp; certificate issued to them (Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1701) did&nbsp; no longer carry any annotation of said writ of attachment.&nbsp; In said certificate of title, however, the register of deeds carried over the&nbsp; annotation which he had made on Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1575 to the effect that the title to Sian was issued in compliance with&nbsp; an&nbsp; order of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Baguio&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; in the registration case in accordance with Section&nbsp; 78 of Act 496,&nbsp; On November 28, 1953, the Rodrigo spouses&nbsp; sold the land to Jose Ma.&nbsp; Delgado for P25,000.00, and Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2441 was&nbsp; issued to the latter.&nbsp; This new title also&nbsp; carried over the annotation regarding the source of the title of Sian in connection&nbsp; with Section 78&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act 496.&nbsp; And on February 7, 1955,&nbsp; that is, almost five years after the property was sold at public auction, this action was&nbsp; commenced by&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; del Castillo,&nbsp; in his capacity as ancillary administrator of the estate&nbsp; of Isabel&nbsp; Schober Jimas.<br><br>The&nbsp; complaint discloses the following facts: That Henry Schober&nbsp; and William Schober were the partners of a firm known as "Schober&nbsp; Brothers"; that following the death of Henry Schober in 1937, in an accounting suit brought by Stanley Kidder, in his&nbsp; capacity as ancillary administrator of&nbsp; Henry Schober, against William Schober, the land in question was adjudicated to William&nbsp; J. Schober; that William&nbsp; J.&nbsp; Schober&nbsp; died&nbsp; on October 21, 1942, leaving a will which&nbsp; was admitted to probate in&nbsp; Special Proceedings No. 71091, Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila; that by order of the court dated November 7, 1947, the residual estate&nbsp; of William Schober,&nbsp; which&nbsp; included&nbsp; the land in question, was delivered by the ancillary&nbsp; administrator, J. B.&nbsp; Hoover, to&nbsp; William&nbsp; Schober's widow and sole heir, Isabel&nbsp; J. Schober, and&nbsp; was duly receipted for&nbsp; by her on November 29, 1947; that Isabel&nbsp; Schober later on married one&nbsp; James A. Jimas; and that&nbsp; she died on April 27, 1953. Plaintiff prays, among other things, that the sale of&nbsp; the land in question at public auction be annulled; that Transfer Certificates of Titles Nos. 1575, 1701 and 2441 issued to defendants Sian, Rodrigo spouses, and Delgado, respectively, be cancelled&nbsp; and that a new one be issued to him in his capacity as&nbsp; ancillary&nbsp; administrator of the estate of Isabel Schober Jimas.<br><br>The lower court dismissed the complaint as against&nbsp; all defendants except the City Treasurer of Baguio.&nbsp; With&nbsp; respect to the later, the court said:&nbsp; "Since the City Treasurer of Baguio sold the&nbsp; whole parcel of land, rather&nbsp; than a portion, to&nbsp; answer&nbsp; for the small sum of P218.13, following this ruling, said sale at public auction was null and void.&nbsp; * * * The provisions of the Land Registration Law bar any recovery of the land irregularly&nbsp; sold&nbsp; at&nbsp; this tax sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; The remedy of plaintiff must, therefore, be limited to an action for damages, namely,&nbsp; the recovery of the market value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the landâ€”and the&nbsp; one responsible for this is the&nbsp; City Treasurer of Baguio."&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; city&nbsp; treasurer appealed&nbsp; on purely questions of law.<br><br>The issues posed&nbsp; in this appeal may be boiled down into two,&nbsp; to wit:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Is the sale at public auction conducted by the City Treasurer of Baguio of the land in question to Delfin S. Sian&nbsp; null and&nbsp; void&nbsp; as found by the&nbsp; trial court? and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Are defendants Delfin S.&nbsp; Sian,&nbsp; Rodrigo spouses, and Jose Ma. Delgado&nbsp; purchasers&nbsp; for value and in good faith?<br><br>The auction sale&nbsp; was undertaken by the City Treasurer of Baguio under the provisions of section 2571, first paragraph, of the Charter of the City of&nbsp; Baguio, which reads :<br><blockquote>"Taxes and penalties assessed against realty shall constitute a lien thereon, which&nbsp; shall be superior&nbsp; to all other liens, mortgages, or incumbrances of any kind whatsoever; shall be enforceable against the property whether&nbsp; in the possession of the&nbsp; delinquent or any subsequent owner, and can only&nbsp; be&nbsp; removed by&nbsp; the payment of the tax and penalty.&nbsp; The lien for taxes&nbsp; shall attach to the real property from the first day&nbsp; of March of the year in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the taxes&nbsp; are due.&nbsp; In&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; last-metioned procedure,&nbsp; the city treasurer may, upon warrant of the certified record required in the last preceding section, on or after the first day of October following&nbsp; delinquency, advertise the real estate of the delinquent for&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; or much thereof as may be&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; satisfy&nbsp; all public taxes upon said&nbsp; property as above, and costs sale, for a period of&nbsp; thirty days."<br></blockquote>It would appear that the city treasurer may, upon the warrant&nbsp; of the certified record regarding&nbsp; delinquency&nbsp; of a taxpayer, advertise&nbsp; the&nbsp; real estate of the&nbsp; delinquent for sale,&nbsp; or so much thereof as may&nbsp; be necessary, to satisfy "all&nbsp; public taxes upon said property as&nbsp; above, and costs of sale."&nbsp; This provision&nbsp; was&nbsp; interpreted by&nbsp; the trial court as&nbsp; mandatory,&nbsp; following a ruling laid down by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law provides that the city&nbsp; treasurer <i>may</i> advertise&nbsp; the real&nbsp; estate of the delinquent for&nbsp; sale, or so much thereof as may be necessary,&nbsp; to&nbsp; satisfy the&nbsp; tax due, which clearly implies that it is merely&nbsp; directory&nbsp; in character.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the city treasurer, being a responsible&nbsp; public official,&nbsp; is expected to use judiciously his judgment&nbsp; in determining the amount of the property that&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; sold for&nbsp; the purpose,&nbsp; having in view the interest or the equities of the taxpayer whose property is involved in the&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; but once he has&nbsp; acted, he should be presumed to have acted in good faith unless the contrary is shown.&nbsp; No such showing was made in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; contrary, the&nbsp; circumstances surrounding the same would appear&nbsp; to justify the&nbsp; action taken by the&nbsp; city treasurer&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; involved merely consists of one lot covered by one certificate&nbsp; of title.<br><br>It is true that the&nbsp; lot contains an area of 7,152 square meters, and its value&nbsp; may&nbsp; be much higher and greater than the&nbsp; price&nbsp; for which it was sold, but&nbsp; how&nbsp; could the city&nbsp; treasurer&nbsp; sell a&nbsp; portion of said lot to&nbsp; satisfy the unpaid tax unless he first undertakes its subdivision? We know that the proper&nbsp; party who&nbsp; should undertake such matter is the owner himself, and&nbsp; no one would venture to buy an undefined portion of real estate without&nbsp; knowing before hand what&nbsp; portion would correspond to him let alone the friction and trouble he might be involved in connection with the remaining&nbsp; ownership of the property. Cases there may be where the&nbsp; official in charge of selling a property may be shown to have&nbsp; acted in bad faith or with&nbsp; gross&nbsp; negligence&nbsp; as where&nbsp; the property is&nbsp; easily divisible,&nbsp; when it is composed&nbsp; of several lots or&nbsp; parcels, or where it consists of personal property, but each case should be decided according&nbsp; to&nbsp; its peculiar circumstances. The&nbsp; situation herein obtained&nbsp; is not one&nbsp; of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is therefore an error for the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court to have&nbsp; declared the sale null&nbsp; and&nbsp; void on&nbsp; the mere failure of&nbsp; the city treasurer to sell&nbsp; a portion of the lots as provided for in the Charter.<br><br>The stipulation of facts submitted by the parties in this case states&nbsp; in part:<br><blockquote>"50. That the letters of&nbsp; administration of&nbsp; the testate estate of William J. Schober, J. B.

Schober, or by the heir of his estate, his wife Isabel J. Schober, or&nbsp; by the administrator of her estate when she subsequently died, the present case would have been&nbsp; probably&nbsp; avoided.&nbsp; In that event,&nbsp; the city treasurer would then&nbsp; have known&nbsp; that the actual owner&nbsp; of the property was no longer the partnership "Schober Brothers", but the widow,&nbsp; and could have&nbsp; easily contacted&nbsp; her, or her representative, regarding the settlement of the assessment in&nbsp; question.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; because these&nbsp; steps&nbsp; were never taken either by the administrator of the estate of&nbsp; William J. Schober,&nbsp; or&nbsp; by the widow, as a consequence, nothing regarding said proceedings appeared on the back of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1555, except&nbsp; one concerning a litigation between one Kidder and the late William J. Schober, the record of which appears not to have been reconstituted.<br><br>At any rate, Delfin&nbsp; S. Sian, who purchased the property at public auction sale, appears to have taken the following precautionary&nbsp; measure: He obtained a certification from the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of Manila having jurisdiction&nbsp; over the case, certifiying to the effect that&nbsp; the&nbsp; record of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case wherein the writ of attachment was&nbsp; issued had&nbsp; not been&nbsp; reconstituted&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the time limit set by law&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reconstitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; said record&nbsp; had&nbsp; expired on June&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1951.&nbsp; This&nbsp; certification was&nbsp; attached&nbsp; as annex&nbsp; to the&nbsp; petition he filed&nbsp; for&nbsp; the cancellation of the annotation of that writ.&nbsp; This petition was&nbsp; ordered published&nbsp; and&nbsp; posted&nbsp; as required&nbsp; by&nbsp; law, and&nbsp; a&nbsp; copy thereof sent&nbsp; by&nbsp; registered mail&nbsp; to&nbsp; Stanley L.&nbsp; Kidder and&nbsp; William J. Schober.&nbsp; After the&nbsp; aforesaid publication and posting had been effected, the court issued an order directing the cancellation of the annotation of attachment in&nbsp; Sian's&nbsp; Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title&nbsp; No. 1555.&nbsp; It cannot, therefore, be said that Sian bought the property in bad faith, or with knowledge of&nbsp; any adverse encumbrance&nbsp; that may affect the validity of the sale.<br><br>With&nbsp; regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rodrigo spouses, the following are also the precautionary measures taken by them.&nbsp; In the deed of sale&nbsp; executed by&nbsp; Sian in&nbsp; their favor, they&nbsp; in eluded a warrancy that&nbsp; Sian would answer for the writ of attachment&nbsp; annotated on the back of his title. The purchase price&nbsp; was&nbsp; P21,000.00, but the spouses withheld the payment to&nbsp; Sian of the sum of P10,000.00 on condition that&nbsp; they will&nbsp; pay the same only&nbsp; after the&nbsp; cancellation of the annotation&nbsp; regarding the writ&nbsp; of attachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August&nbsp; 22, 1951,&nbsp; the court ordered&nbsp; the cancellation of said annotation, and immediately thereafter&nbsp; the spouses paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; Sian the balance of P10,000.00.&nbsp; When, therefore, said&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; registered their deed of purchase, the annotation of the attachment&nbsp; had already&nbsp; been cancelled, and so the new title issued&nbsp; in their name did not carry any annotation of encumbrance&nbsp; with the exception only of that which&nbsp; refers to the proceeding&nbsp; relative&nbsp; to the cancellation in compliance with Section 78 of&nbsp; Act No. 496. They can, therefore, be considered as <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> purchasers for value.<br><br>Purchaser Jose M. Delgado is in a better position.&nbsp;&nbsp; He bought&nbsp; the property from the Rodrigo spouses for the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P25,000.00 when their title no longer&nbsp; carried any annotation regarding&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ of attachment.&nbsp; There is therefore no&nbsp; circumstance, nor reason, by which we can declare&nbsp; him&nbsp; to have&nbsp; acted&nbsp; in&nbsp; bad faith as&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; by plaintiff-appellant.<br><br>Plaintiff claims&nbsp; that because the property passed&nbsp; to Isabel S. Jimas&nbsp; prior to the tax sale, there was no title the "Schober Brothers" could transfer because they were no longer the property owners at the time&nbsp; of the sale, although the records do not show otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; He claims that the will is the&nbsp; operative act that alone transferred title of the land to Isabel J. Schober, invoking in support thereof the provisions of Section 50 of Act 496.<br><br>This contention is contrary not only to the provisions of said section,&nbsp; but to the constant jurisprudence established by this&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; Thus, this Court held in one case: "We hold&nbsp; that under the Torrens system,&nbsp; registration is the operative act that gives validity to the transfer or creates a lien upon the land&nbsp; (sections 50 and 51, Land Registration Act).&nbsp; A person dealing with registered land is not required to go behind the register to determine the condition of&nbsp; the property.&nbsp; He is only charged with&nbsp; notice of&nbsp; the burdens on the property which are noted on the face&nbsp; of the register or the certificate of title.&nbsp; To require him&nbsp; to do more is to defeat one of the primary objects of the Torrens system.&nbsp;&nbsp; A <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide </span>purchaser for value of such property at&nbsp; an auction sale&nbsp; acquires good title as against a prior transferee&nbsp; of the same property if such transfer was unrecorded at&nbsp; the time of&nbsp; the auction sale" (William H.
