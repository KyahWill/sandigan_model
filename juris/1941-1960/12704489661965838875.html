				<H3>VICTORIO REYNOSO AND JUAN REYNOSO, PETITIONERS VS. VICENTE SANTIAGO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF QUEZON, PIA REYNOSO, AGUSTINA REYNOSO, MELITON PALABRICA, LEONCIO CADIZ ET AL., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Victorio Reynoso and Juan Reynoso apply for a writ of mandamus 
to compel Judge Vicente Santiago of the Court of First Instance of Quezon to 
order the opening of a testate estate of the deceased Salvadora Obispo in the 
place of special intestate proceeding No. 2914, and to appoint Victorio Reynoso 
as executor of the decedent's last will and testament.
<p align="justify">Briefly, the facts are as follows: On April 29, 1947, Leoncio 
Cadiz and other heirs of Salvadora Obispo presented an application in the Court 
of First Instance of Quezon for the administration of the property of the 
deceased, application which was docketed as intestate proceeding No. 2914. 
Victorio Reynoso and Juan Reynoso, Salvadora Obispo's surviving spouse and 
eldest son, respectively, opposed the application and filed a document, which 
purported to be the last will and testament of Salvadora Obispo, with a 
counterpetition for its probate. Upon trial the court rejected that instrument 
as a forgery, but on appeal the Court of Appeals reversed the finding of the 
court below, found the will authentic and drawn with all the formalities of law. 
The dispository part of the decision of the Appellate Court, promulgated 
November 27, 1948, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Se revoca la sentencia de que se apela, y reuniendo el 
exhibito A los requisites exigidos por la ley, se ordena, (a) la Iegalizacion de 
dicho documento como testamento y ultima voluntad de la finada Salvadora Obispo, 
para que surta todos sus efectos legales; (b) la apertura de la testamentaria de 
dicha finada; y (c) el nombranriento de un albacea de la misma testamentaria de 
conformidad con el precepto del articulo 6, de la Eegla 70 de los Reglamentos de 
los Tribunales."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Thereafter Victorio Reynoso and Juan Reynoso filed two 
petitions, one in special proceeding No. 2914 and another under a separate and 
new docket number (3107) and with a different title (Testate Estate of the 
deceased Salvadora Obispo). The first prayed that the special administrator, 
Meliton Palabrica, who had theretofore been appointed in special proceeding No. 
2914, be ordered to turn over the properties of the deceased and the proceeds of 
coprax, nuts and other agricultural products to Victorio Reynoso, and to render 
an accounting within a reasonable time. It also asked for the closing of the 
intestate proceeding. The other petition prayed that the estate be administered 
and settled in special proceeding No. 3107 and that Victorio Reynoso be 
appointed executor of Salvadora Obispo's last will and testament. It also 
contained a prayer for an accounting by Palabrica and delivery by him to the new 
executor of the properties that came to his possession including the proceeds 
from the sales of coprax, nuts, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">The two petitions were decided separately by Judge Santiago on 
April 20, 1949. With respect to the opening of another <em>expediente</em>, His 
Honor believed that the proposed change or substitution was "not only 
unnecessary but inconvenient and expensive." An intestate proceeding like 
special proceeding No. 2914, he said, could and should be converted into a 
testate proceeding in the same original <em>expediente</em> without the 
necessity of changing its number, name or title.</p>
<p align="justify">This petition has no merit. Whether the intestate proceeding 
already commenced should be discontinued and a new proceeding under a separate 
number and title should be constituted is entirely a matter of form and lies 
within the sound discretion of the court. In no manner does it prejudice the 
substantial rights of any of the heirs or creditors. <em>Amor propio</em> is 
perhaps the only thing that is at stake on this phase of the controversy.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the appointment of the deceased's husband as executor or 
administrator, the court said that action on the petition should be withheld for 
the time being, because of the pendency on appeal of a case in which the special 
administrator in special proceeding No. 2914 is plaintiff and appellee and 
Victorio Reynoso defendant and appellant. It involves the question whether an 
extensive parcel of coconut land is conjugal property or the exclusive property 
of the husband.</p>
<p align="justify">On this feature of the second petition we disagree with the 
respondent judge. If one other than the surviving spouse is appointed, which is 
possible, the feared conflict will not materialize. If Victorio Reynoso is 
chosen, a special administrator may be named to represent the estate in the suit 
against him. Section 8 of Rule 87 provides that "If the executor or 
administrator has a claim against the estate he represents, he shall give notice 
thereof, in writing, to the court, and the court shall appoint a special 
administrator who shall, in the adjustment of such claim, have the same power 
and be subject to the same liability as the general administrator or executor in 
the settlement of other claims." The situation in which Victorio Reynoso is 
found with reference to the land in litigation between him and the estate, comes 
within the spirit if not exactly within the letter of this provision.</p>
<p align="justify">Subject to this observation, an administrator should be 
appointed without delay in accordance with the final decision of the Court of 
Appeals. The appointment of a special administrator is justified only when there 
is delay in granting letters testamentary or of administration occasioned by an 
appeal from the allowance or disallowance of a will or some other cause. The 
Court of Appeals having decreed the probate of the will and the appointment of 
an <em>albacea</em>, there is no valid reason for the further retention of the 
special administrator. The appointment of a regular administrator is necessary 
for the prompt settlement and distribution of the estate. There are important 
duties devolving on a regular administrator which a special administrator can 
not perform, and there are many actions to be taken by the court which could not 
be accomplished before a regular administrator is appointed.</p>
<p align="justify">But whether or not Victorio Reynoso should be appointed as 
administrator we do not and can not of course decide in a petition for mandamus. 
While the surviving spouse is entitled to preference in the appointment (section 
6, Rule 79), circumstances might warrant his rejection and the appointment of 
someone else. Mandamus lies where the duty is specific and ministerial. It does 
not lie where judgment or discretion is exercised in the performance of the act. 
Applying the rule to this case, it is proper to command the court below to 
appoint a regular administrator, but it is not proper to tell it whom to 
appoint.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition for the constitution of a separate proceeding for 
the administration of the estate under the will is denied. The petition for the 
appointment of a regular administrator is granted subject to the provision of 
section 6 of Rule 79 in the selection of the person to be appointed. Without 
costs.</p> <em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla,
