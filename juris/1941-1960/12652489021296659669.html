				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by certiorari from the decision of the Court 
of Industrial Relations, on the ground that the latter committed an error of law 
in ordering the reinstatement of the appellee Vicente Fortich.
<p align="justify">The conclusions or findings of fact of the lower court are as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The following facts are undisputed: Fortich was the branch 
manager of petitioner in San Pablo City, and the territory covered by said 
branch comprises the provinces of Laguna, Batangas and Tayabas. Beside being a 
branch manager, he was also a salesman of petitioner. A truck was assigned to 
the branch for demonstration purposes. On April 16, 1947, Fortich used the truck 
in going to Manila to attend a meeting of respondent union. On that date, the 
union declared a strike, and on the following day, Fortich telegraphed from 
Manila to M.P. Agarao, an employee of the San Pablo Branch, ordering the latter 
to close the branch office, but to have the doors and windows of the building 
secured, Fortich kept the truck until May 9, 1947 when he returned it to the San 
Pablo office. During the period from April 17 to May 9, 1947, he used the truck 
for demonstration to several prospective buyers in Laguna and Manila. He brought 
the truck to Manila at least five times during this period. It was found that 
the truck was so used that it could not be sold anymore as a first hand truck 
and respondent had to convert it into a service truck.</p><p align="center">x x x x x<br></p>
<p align="justify">"As regards the first point, Fortich maintains, that as branch 
manager, he had the authority to close or order the closing of his branch office 
whose employees were all members of the union which voted to strike. It may 
easily be conceded that he had that authority insofar as his subordinate 
employees in the branch are concerned, but certainly not insofar as his employer 
or the main office is concerned unless such authority had been previously 
granted him. Not only did he order the closing without securing authority or 
permission to do so, but he did not even notify his superiors in the main 
office.</p>
<p align="justify">"Fortich also maintains that there was no need for him to 
secure permission or authority before taking the truck outside of his territory 
for the purpose of showing it to customers because he had been doing it before. 
Petitioner maintains the contrary and insists that Fortich was supposed to 
demonstrate the truck only within the territory assigned to him. We are inclined 
to accept the contention of petitioner because otherwise, there would be no 
meaning to the delimitation of the field of operation of the branch in question 
if its manager or any of its personnel could go freely outside their territory 
to transact business. * * * </p>
<p align="justify">"* * * The position of Fortich is not that of an ordinary 
employee or laborer. As a matter of fact, he belongs more to the mangerial staff 
than to the rank and file of petitioner's employees and laborers. * * *</p>
<p align="justify">"In connection with, the retention of the demonstration truck 
in his possession when he was already on strike, there can be no doubt that it 
was highly improper. It was clearly his duty, upon joining the strike, to return 
to petitioning company whatever properties belonging to it were in his 
possession. If he cannot properly continue holding suoh properties, much less 
could he use them even for the purposes of the business of the company. * * * 
</p>
<p align="justify">"The record discloses that Fortich is a mechanical engineer and 
he was petitioner's branch manager in San Pablo even before the war. Although in 
the instant case, he actually violated his trust as branch manager, having been 
influenced undoubtedly by his loyalty to respondent union, the court is of the 
opinion and so holds that the offenses he committed, as above explained, can 
hardly justify his complete dismissal from the service. He has been laid-off for 
almost 9 months now and that must be considered a sufficient punishment for 
him."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is well settled that an employer or principal may discharge 
or dismiss his employee or agent for just cause or for malfeasance or 
misfeasance in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p align="justify">When the law does not, directly or inferentially, define the 
kind of misfeasance or malfeasance for which an employee or laborer may be 
dismissed or discharged, but the law leaves it to the court to determine whether 
or not an act or omission on the part of the employee may be considered as a 
just cause for his dismissal in view of the facts and circumstances of each case 
question for the Court of Industrial Relations to determine is one of fact. It 
is a question of fact because there is no law or rule which serves as guide to 
the Court in deciding it, and the Court of Industrial Relations may decide it in 
a way or another without violating any law, but it may gravely abuse its 
discretion if its decision is arbitrary or whimsical, that is, contrary to 
reason, logic or equity. The court's decision in such case is final and can not 
be appealed to this Supreme Court by certiorari, because only questions of law 
may be raised in the appeal or petition for certiorari according to section 2, 
rule 44. And if the Court decides the question of fact with grave abuse of 
discretion, a special civil action of certiorari filed with the Supreme Court 
would be the proper remedy.</p>
<p align="justify">But where the law provides or defines what acts or omission, 
misfeasance or malfeasance, constitute a just cause for which an employee or 
agent may be discharged by his employer or principal, and those acts or 
omissions are found by the court to have been established or proven, the 
question whether or not the former has been legally and properly dismissed by 
the latter is a question of law, and the decision of the Court of Industrial 
Relations on that question is appealable to this Supreme Court by 
certiorari.</p>
<p align="justify">In the present case the Court of Industrial Relations, 
according to the above quoted conclusions of fact, has found that the 
relationship between the petitioner and the respondent Fortich was that of 
agency or of principal and agent, because the respondent was a manager of the 
branch office of the petitioner in San Pablo, Laguna; and that the respondent 
Fortich "has actually violated his trust as branch manager" of the petitioner's 
office in San Pablo, Laguna, for the sale of automobiles and trucks. The 
relationship between them being of trust, based on the confidence of the 
prinoipal in the agent, article 300 of the Code of Commerce is applicable.</p>
<p align="justify">Said article 300 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Art. 300. The following shall be special causes for which 
merchants may discharge their employees, even though the term of the contract 
has not expired:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. Fraud or breach of trust in the transactions entrusted to 
them.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. Engaging in any commercial transaction for their own 
account, without the express knowledge and permission of the principal. * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the case of Barretto vs. Santa Marina, (26 Phil., 440), this 
Supreme Court held that "even though a period is stipulated during which the 
agent or employee is to hold his position in the service of the owner or head of 
a mercantile establishment, yet the latter may, for any of the special reasons 
specified in article 300 of the Code of Commerce, dismiss suoh agent or employee 
even before the termination of the period." The provision of said article 300 of 
the Code of Commerce as well as the above quoted decision of this Court rendered 
before the promulgation of Act No. 103 as amended, are still applicable although 
the respondent was a member of the Manila Trading Laborers' Association, a labor 
union, because there is nothing in said Act which is in conflict with said 
article 300.</p>
<p align="justify">To order the petitioner as principal to reinstate the 
respondent Fortich would the former to continue with the employment of the 
latter as its agent, in whom the petitioner has lost its confidence and whose 
continuance in the service is patently inimical to its interest.</p>
<p align="justify">The fact that the respondent Fortich had been laid off for 
almost nine (9) months without pay during the pendency of this case in the Court 
of Industrial Relations, can not be considered, as the lower court does, as a 
sufficient punishment for said respondent's breach of trust and a justification 
for his reinstatement in the service of the petitioner. As the respondent 
Faction has violated his trust as branch manager, and the petitioner was 
justified, under article 300 of the Code of Commerce, in dismissing and 
discharging him, the former has no right whatsoever to receive any salaries or 
compensation from the latter for services he had not rendered during the time he 
has been laid off, and consequently his having been laid off or discharged not 
only during said period but definitely cannot be considered as a punishment in 
lieu of his discharge or dismissal.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, the decision of the lower eourt 
ordering the reinstatement of the respondent Vicente Fortich in the service of 
the petitioner is hereby reversed. So ordered.</p>

<p align="justify">Siento no estar conforme con la decisidn de la mayoria, sobre 
todo al aplicar al presente caso el art. 300 del Codigo de Comercio. Este 
artlculo, en lo tocante a lag disputas entre el trabajo y el capital, entre los 
obreros*y la gerancia ("management" como se dice actualmente) , lia sido 
practicamente derogado por las leyes del Commonwealth Kos. 103 y 313 q/ue vienen 
a ser cartas orgdni'cas de 1'a Corte de Relaciones Industriales. La regla ahora enresta jurisdicci6n es q.ue rtel dereclio del patrono 
o.principal de escoger o destituir libreraente a sus empleados y obreros es 
basicamente susceptible de ser reglamentado por el Estado en el ejercicio del 
supremo poder de policia", y a este efecto se aprobaron las referidas leyes del 
Commonwealth. Nos. 103 y 213. Asf lo deolaramos en el asunto de Manila Trading 
Go. v. Zulueta and Phil. Labor Union, 40 O.G. supp. No.10, pp. 183, 
184 y 185, y asi tambien lo hemos declarado en el asunto mas reoiente 
de Manila Hotel Company y_. Court of Ind. .Relations and the Ma-nila Hofrsl 
Employees' Association, G.R. No. L-1557 (Enero 29, 1948), del cual tomo los 
siguientes , pronunciamientos :</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">"Puede decirse q.ue-en este asunto no se discute 
practicament'e ninguna cuestion rundaipental de defecho. Parece que ambas partes 
reconocen y admiten la certezade las' siguientes proposiciones ,&nbsp; a saber: a) 
que el derebho del patrono o principal de escfdger o destituir libremente a sus empleados y obreres es basicamente sasceptible de ser reglajiientado par el 
Estado en el ejercicio del supremo poder de policia; b) 'que si 
bien es eierto que un patrono o principal no puede ser compeli&amp;oo.legalmen 
te a oontinuar empleando a una. persona que es culpable de mala conduct a hacia 
dicho principal y suya continuacidn en el servieio de este ultima resulta 
perjudicial a% sus intereses, pues'ia ley, al proteger los derechos del obrero, 
no autoriza la opresidn ni la destruccion del principal, es, sin embargo, tambien cierto que <u>hay casos en que la destitucion o suspension de un empleado resulta caprichosa, o injustificada, o de otro modo ilegal, en cuyo caso el obrero debe ser protegido por el Estado mediante la agencia o 
instrumento que tenga para ello que en nuestro caso es la Corte de Relaciones 
Industriales</u>&nbsp; (Leyes del Commonwealth Nos. 103 y 213; Manila Trading Co. 
v. Zulueta and Philippine Labor Union, 40 O.G., Supplement No. 10, pp. 183, 184,185). (Underlining supplied) .</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p align="justify">"La cuestion que plantea ante Nos la recurrente es mas bien una 
de hecho, a saber: jjustifican los heelios probados en autos ladecisidii de la 
Gorte de Relaciones Industriales, revocando la destitucidn decretada por la 
reeurrente y ordenanfe la reposicidn del empleado destituido? La recurrente dice 
que no; que su accidn expulsando a Prancisco David se ejecutd en el curso normal 
de los negocios, para eliminar a un elemento subversivo y perjudicial a sus 
intereses. Por btro iado, la Corte de Relaciones Industriales dice que, aun 
admitiendo que la conducta del empleado David antes de la guerra justificaba una 
accidn disclp'inaria e.ncontra suya, su prolongada suspe-mtsidn o cl'sl ^ya es 
un adecuado oastigo.<br><br>"La corte a quo arribo a todas estas oonclusiones de spues

Despues de revisar los autos no liemos, hallado ningun motivo para alterar o 
revocar tales conclusiones, formadas por el tribunal inferior con mejores 
elementos e ingredientes que nosotros para enjuiciar los lieohos. Solamente nos 
sentiriaraos autorizadosa sustittiir nuestro juicio al de la Gortrialers 
dentisimo de abuso o de ausencia evidentisima de pruebas que apoyaran la 
sentenola objelib de alzada. No es este e TasoTn (underlining supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">El caso que nos ocupa es enteramente identico al del Manila 
Hotel tlltimamente citado. Alll la Gorte de Relaciones Tndustriales, en vista de 
los lieclios que lialld probados, revoco" la destitucidn proveida por la 
gerencia del Manila Hotel y ordend la reposicidn del empleado afec bado. 
Sstimamos entonces que la Gorte Industrial no a bus de su discrecidn al apreciar 
los heclios; as que rehusamos abrogar o de cualquier modo alterar la orden 
apelada, dieisndo que el tribunal inferior liabla formulado su conclusion "con 
me go res elementos e ingredientes que nosotros para enjuiciar los lieclios" y 
que "Solamente nos sentirfamds autorizados a sustituir nuestro juicio al de la 
Corte de Helaciones Industriales en un caso evidentfsimo de abuso o de ausencia 
evidentlsiraa de pruebas que apoyaran la sentencia objeto dealzada".</p>
<p align="justify">Aqui la mayoria revoca la resolucion de la Corte de Relaciones 
Indus triales no porque gsta haya abusado. de au disciecidn en la apreciacidn de 
los lieclios. sino por una razdn puramente legal la de gue el art. 300 del 
C3digo de Comercio autoriza al patrono o principal para expulsar al. empleado en 
un caso de frauds o abuso de ooirfianza en las ::estiones&gt; que aquel les 
liabiere confiado; pero ya hemos demostrado que en relacidn eon las disputas 
industriales este artlculo ha quedado prficticamente derogado por las leyes 
citadas del Comraonwealth Nos. 105 1 213.</p>
<p align="justify">Es lamentable que ahora que estamos sentando las bases de una 
jurispriidencia progresiva en lo que se refiere a las leyes que regulan las 
relaciones entre el capital y el trabajo, venga esta decision de la mayorla que 
implica una radical desviacidn de una dootrina muy reciente. No o barrena ello 
el princlpio tradicional sobre stare decisls, sino q.ue retarda el expedito y 
pie no deaenvolvimiento de nuestra jurisprudencia en ouestiones sociales, 
obreras e industriales.</p>
<p align="justify">oto, por tanto, en favor de la confirmacidn de la resolueidn 
apelada de la Corte de Relaciones Industriales.</p> Moran, <i>Pres</i>., Concurro con esta opinion disidente.</div>
