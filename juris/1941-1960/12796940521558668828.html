				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">From a decision of the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental 
finding Arcadio Lumahang, father, Guillermo Lumahang, Genaro Lumahang, 
Zosimo Lumahang and Constancio Lumahang, sons and brothers, guilty of 
the murder of Victoriano. Vicente, and sentencing each of them to suffer
 the penalty of life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs of the 
deceased Victoriano Vicente, jointly and severally, in the amount of 
P5,000, with the accessory penalty provided by law, Genaro Lumahang has 
appealed. His counsel claims in his brief that said appellant was not at
 the scene of the crime and did not participate therein, but that he was
 then in his house.
<p>The evidence presented by the prosecution shows, and it is not denied
 by the appellant, that on February 26, 1952, at about eight o'clock in 
the evening, while Victoriano Vicente and his son Cesar were walking 
home on the road from the market place of barrio Tuyabang Bajo, 
Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental, they were suddenly met by Arcadio 
Lumahang and his sons, who had been crouching on the road in wait for 
them; Guillermo, upon recognizing Cesar Vicente, who was ahead of his 
father, attacked Cesar with his bolo, but Cesar was able to escape and 
run away. Guillerrno gave up the pursuit and immediately returned to 
where his father was. It was then that Victoriano Vicente arrived at the
 place. Arcadio accosted him, and upon recognizing that it was 
Victoriano, he informed Guillermo about it. Thereupon Guillermo flashed 
his light on Victoriano and immediately assaulted him with his bolo, his
 father and other brothers joining him in the attack. Victoriano 
received various wounds in the arms, in the face, and in the back, but 
was still able to run away, about fifty meters away from the place where
 he was first attacked. Cesar went to inform the police about the attack
 on his father, and the police found the latter dead on the road. A 
policeman went to the house of Genaro and there found, together with 
Genaro, Zosimo and Arcadio. Arcadio was found rolled in a mat, trying to
 hide himself, with a blood-stained bolo in his possession. The 
policeman also found a blood-stained scythe in the house of Genaro. The 
father and his sons were taken by the police, and Arcadio, Guillermo, 
and Gonstancio made written confessions admitting their participation in
 the assault on the deceased Victoriano Vicente. These affidavits were 
taken the day following the commission of the crime.</p>
<p>It was also shown that on February 16, 1952, a dance was held in the 
school building, wherein Guillermo and his brothers participated, 
Guillermo and his brothers danced even without having ribbons, in 
violation of a rule that only those with ribbons could be allowed to 
dance Cesar was the sergeant-at-arms on that occasion, and he called 
attention to the president of the dance that Guillernio and his brothers
 were dancing without the corresponding ribbons. Guillermo had asked 
that he also be pinned with a ribbon, but as he refused to pay the price
 for the ribbon, he was not given one. Notwithstanding this, he 
continued dancing. After this incident, Guillermo called his brothers 
together, telling them to prepare themselves for a fight and learn how 
to fence.</p>
<p>On February 26, about six o'clock in the evening, Guillermo saw Cesar
 in the market place and invited the latter to drink <em>tuba</em>, but 
Cesar refused. Afterwards Guillermo was seen with a bolo, but this bolo 
was taken away by Victoriano, Cesar'3 father. After this Guillermo 
disappeared in the market place.</p>
<p>Defendant-appellant Genaro Lumahang did not make any confession, and 
he asked for a separate trial for the presentation of his evidence.</p>
<p>The evidence submitted by the prosecution with respect to his 
participation in the attack consists of the testimonies of three 
witnesses. Basilio Pandac, the first witness, testified that at about 
eight o’clock in the evening of February 26, 1952, as he was going home 
and had just passed the school building, and was approaching that part 
of the road where there were many acacia trees, he saw Arcadio and his 
sons crouching near the road in wait for someone. Arcadio, Guillermo, 
and Zosimo were in a line, and behind them were Genaro and Gonstancio. 
As he passed Arcadio, the latter asked him who he was, and as he 
answered that he was Basilio Pandac, he was allowed to pass by. But as 
he walked farther on to the other two behind, Constancio suddenly 
attacked him with his scythe but was not able to hit him, because he 
immediately ran away and hid himself among the bushes beside the road. 
He stopped for a while to find out whether he had been wounded, and felt
 that he was not, although the weapon with which he was attacked had 
produced a rent in his khaki shirt. At that time there was light from a 
Petromax lamp about twenty meters away from where he was attacked, and 
with that light he was able to recognize Genaro and Constancio on the 
road near the acacia trees. Genaro was then wearing a red undershirt 
with short drawers.</p>
<p>Another witness, Policarpio Morales, testified that as he was also 
going home that evening at about eight o'clock, he saw Arcadio and his 
sons approaching the place where a Petromax lamp had been left. He saw 
Arcadio hit the lamp with a stick. The lamp had been left by the one who
 had been carrying it because of, the commotion that had been seen on 
the road ahead. He saw Cesar Vicente approaching the place where Arcadio
 and his sons were, and he also saw how Cesar was pursued by Guillermo, 
and how Cesar's father Victoriano was simultaneously attacked by 
Guillermo and his brothers and their father. He declared that the father
 and all his four sons helped in the attack, and that he recognized 
Genaro as one of them, because he had recognized him while he was still 
crouching on the road before the attack took place.</p>
<p>The third witness is Cesar Vicente, who declared that from a distance
 of thirteen meters he saw Genaro actually slashing at his father just 
after he had been pursued by Guillermo. He said that with the flashlight
 of Guillermo, he was able to see Genaro crouching on the road on his 
right side in front of him just before he was attacked, and that while 
his father was being assaulted, the light from the flashlight of 
Guillermo enabled him to recognize Genaro as one of the assailants.</p>
<p>The evidence submitted by Genaro to counteract the testimonies of the
 three eyewitnesses who testified to his presence at the scene of the 
crime, consists of his own testimony and that of his wife. His wife 
testified that on February 24, 25, and 26 Genaro, her husband, was 
gathering nuts from the land of one Rosenda Abuton; that late in the 
afternoon of February 26, Genaro went with her to the market place; that
 they went home together at sunset, their house being two hundred meters
 away from the market place; that when her husband arrived at their 
house, he attended to making ropes for the c&amp;rabao, while she cooked
 food for their supper; that they heard shouts coming from the market 
place between six and seven o'clock in the evening; that at that time 
Arcadio, Guillermo, and Zosimo went to their house, confirming the fact 
that there had been trouble in the market place; that after supper she 
went to the house of the wife of Guillermo, who was sick, and that she 
slept there that night.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the supposed presence of her husband in their 
house was before seven o'clock, while the evidence shows that the 
assault took place at eight o'clock in the evening. Considering that the
 house of Genaro is only two hundred meters away from the market place, 
and his wife went: away after supper at about seven o'clock, it is 
evident that her testimony does not exclude the probability of her 
husband’s presence at the place of the assault,Genaro, for his part, 
declared that about seven o'clock in the. evening he heard shouts coming
 from the market, after which his father and Guillermo and Zosimo 
arrived; that Guillermo told him that he had trouble with Victoriano 
Vicente, and that they had hacked at each other; that it was eight 
o’clock when Guillermo recounted the story to him; that after a while 
the authorities arrived and asked him to come down. He denied that he 
had attended the dance on February 16, 1952. He also denied the 
testimony of Basilio Pandac regarding his having been seen on the road 
on the evening of the incident, although he admits that he has no grudge
 against Basilio Pandac. He claimed that the testimony of Policarpio 
Morales that he was seen on the road that evening is false, alleging 
that he had a misunderstanding with him, because he had thrown a bolo at
 the pig of Morales when the pig had destroyed his camote plants.</p>
<p>It is important to note that his father and his brothers who had made
 confessions stated therein that Genaro took part in the assault on 
Victoriano Vicente. While confessions of a co-conspirator are not 
ordinarily admissible as evidence against another co-conspirator, the 
fact that they implicate the latter and were made soon after the 
commission of the crime, is circumstantial evidence to show the 
probability of their co-conspirator having actually participated 
therein. Especially is this so in the case at bar, where the 
co-conspirator implicated is a son or a brother. Besides, if Genaro had 
not actually participated in the assault, he should have called upon his
 brothers to testify in his favor, which he did not.</p>
<p>There is no evidence worthy of the name that we may consider as 
corroborating Genaro’s denial of his participation, that of his wife 
having been shown to be of no value at all. We have carefully read the 
testimonies of the witnesses who declared to have recognized him as 
among the five who were crouching on the road awaiting their victim, and
 we have not been able to see anything therein which may cast some doubt
 on their credibility. The claim of appellant that he did not 
participate in the commission of the crime must, therefore, be 
dismissed.</p>
<p>Finding no error in the sentence imposed upon the accused, including 
the defendant-appellant, the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
