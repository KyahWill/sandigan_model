				<H3>ESPERANZA F. DE GONZALEZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ERNESTO GONZALEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TORRES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This case is before this Court upon certification by the Court 
of Appeals which in its resolution of February 17, 1948 said that it lacks 
jurisdiction to pass upon the question raised by appellant herein.<p></p>
<p align="justify">It appears that on January 2, 1946, in civil case No. 70660 
between the above-named parties, the Court of First Instance of Manila 
<i>pendente lite</i> issued an order commanding the defendant to pay the 
plaintiff a monthly pension of P500 for her support and that of her eight 
children beginning from July 1, 1945 less the amounts already delivered by him 
to plaintiff for her support.
</p><p align="justify">The case was appealed, and on April 29, 1947, the Court of 
Appeals rendered a decision the dispositive part of which says: "In view of the 
foregoing considerations, the judgment of the trial court is modified, reducing 
the amount of support to P350 monthly, with costs."</p>
<p align="justify">On June 18, 1947, and in connection with the above-quoted 
dispositive part of the decision of the Court of Appeals, the Honorable Felipe 
Natividad of the Court of First Instance of Manila, issued an order the 
dispositive part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Wherefore, the order of this Court of February 10, 1947, is 
hereby amended so as to read as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">" 'Wherefore, the defendant, Ernesto Gonzalez, is hereby 
ordered to pay to the plaintiff, Ezperanza F. de Gonzalez, the amount of P2,845 
as pension in arrears for the support of said plaintiff and her eight children 
living with her for the period from July 1, 1945, to May 31, 1947, within 
fifteen days counted from that on which notice of this order is served on him, 
plus the sum of P350 monthly beginning June 1, 1947, for the same concept, until 
further orders from this Court.' "</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="justify">This case was brought once more to the Court of Appeals, 
appellant Ernesto Gonzalez alleging that the lower court erred in making the 
decision of the Court of Appeals effective only from June 1, 1947, and not from 
July 1, 1945, and that therefore it also erred in ordering the 
defendant-appellant to pay the plaintiff-appellee the sum of P2,845 as pension 
in arrears.</p>
<p align="justify">The above-quoted dispositive part of the decision of the Court 
of Appeals, is silent as to the date when the payment of the reduced monthly 
support of P350 to appellee shall become effective. Appellant claims that the 
monthly payment of the sum of P350 should be made effective as of July 1, 1945. 
On the other hand, the appellee contends that a monthly pension of P500 should 
be paid to her during the period from July, 1945 to May 31, 1947, and thereafter 
said pension should be at the rate of P350 monthly. Thus while the appellant 
contends that the lower court arbitrarily interpreted the decision of the Court 
of Appeals, the appellee holds the contrary view. Therefore, the Court of 
Appeals in its said resolution of February 17, 1948, held that, there being no 
question of fact raised, the issue involved herein is clearly one of law.</p>
<p align="justify">From the clear wording of the dispositive part of the decision 
of April 29, 1947, it cannot be denied that when the Court of Appeals said that 
"the judgment of the trial court is modified, reducing the amount of support to 
P350 monthly," it meant that the reduction of the amount of the monthly pension 
from P500 to P350 is applicable to the whole period covered by this litigation, 
and, therefore, it became effective from July 1, 1945. In the absence of any 
word or expression which might suggest a contrary intention on the part of the 
Court of Appeals, the above is the most correct and sound interpretation of the 
wording of the dispositive part of said decision of the Court of Appeals, 
particularly in view of the fact that defendant appealed from the order of the 
lower court of January 2, 1946, on the question of the amount which he should 
pay the plaintiff for her support and that of his eight children, which was 
decided by the Court of Appeals by reducing it from P500 to P350.</p>
<p align="justify">We, therefore, reverse the order of the lower court of June 18, 
1947, in so far as it is not in accord with the terms of this decision; 
otherwise, it is affirmed. The Court of First Instance shall make the necessary 
and proper readjustment of the amount, if any, that is still due the plaintiff. 
Without costs. So ordered.</p> <i>Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
