				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Maria Consuelo Ignacio died testate on August 18, 1945, leaving behind&nbsp; an estate consisting of—<br><blockquote><ol><li>One-half interest in a parcel of land situated in Orani, Bataan, identified as Lot&nbsp;

(No. 1&nbsp; of the list of Properties&nbsp; reproduced above), tor her surviving husband, Tomas Tagle; <br><br></li><li>Her share in Lot No. 1213 of&nbsp; the Orani Cadastre,&nbsp; atoo owned by the conjugal partnership&nbsp; (No. 2 of the List), to her husband, Tomas Tagle; <br><br></li><li>The naked ownership of&nbsp; Lot No. 1148, 1087 and 856, referred to as Lot Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of&nbsp; Transfer Certificate&nbsp; of Title No. 1223 (Nos. 3,&nbsp; 4 and 5&nbsp; of the List), was bequeathed to her&nbsp; nephew, Agustin Ignacio,&nbsp; Sr.,&nbsp; although&nbsp; the usufruct and&nbsp; administration thereof was given to her husband, Tomas Tagle during the latter's lifetime.&nbsp; In connection with the properties, the will imposed upon her husband,&nbsp; and in case of his death, on Agustin Ignacio,&nbsp; Sr., the obligation to&nbsp; give— <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a)&nbsp; An annual pension of P100 to Fr.&nbsp; Agapito Ignacio (for an unspecified duration); <br>(b) An annual pension&nbsp; of P100 to&nbsp; Florentina&nbsp; Dionisio&nbsp; as long as she remained unmarried;<br>(c) Support&nbsp;

of Title No. 1223&nbsp; (No. 6 of the&nbsp; List&nbsp; of Properties) to Agustin Ignacio,&nbsp; Jr., and<br><br></li><li>The religious images were given to&nbsp; Tomas Tagle,&nbsp; but upon his death, ownership over the same would pass to Agustin Ignacio, Sr. Tomas Tagle was also named executor of said will, without the necessity of filing a bond.<br></li></ol></blockquote>On September 8, 1945, Tomas Tagle filed a petition with the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Bataan&nbsp; for the probate of his&nbsp; wife's last will &nbsp; (Sp.&nbsp; Proc.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1811).&nbsp;&nbsp; After due publication and&nbsp; hearing, and in view of the absence&nbsp; of any&nbsp; opposition to its probate,&nbsp; the will was allowed&nbsp; on November&nbsp; 16, 1945.&nbsp; Consequently, or on&nbsp; December 26, 1945, letters testamentary were issued&nbsp; to&nbsp; Tomas Tagle, the executor named&nbsp; in the will, authorizing him to&nbsp; take possession&nbsp; of all the properties of the decedent and&nbsp; perform all acts necessary for that preservation and ultimate distribution. <br><br>On March&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1946, the executor submitted an inventory of the&nbsp; estate showing it&nbsp; to be worth P9,195, without any liability.&nbsp; In the accounting&nbsp; rendered by the executor&nbsp; on December 17, 1946,&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate appeared to have&nbsp; made a net earning&nbsp; of P20.&nbsp; This statement of account was approved by the Court on April 10, 1947. <br><br>On April 29,&nbsp; 1947, the executor&nbsp; and Agustin&nbsp; Ignacio, Sr.,&nbsp; one of the&nbsp; testamentary heirs, filed a joint motion for leave to&nbsp; sell in favor of&nbsp; a certain Pastor Manalo Lot No. 1 of T.C.T. No. 1223&nbsp; (No. 3 of the List of Properties), in consideration of the sum&nbsp; of P20,000.&nbsp; This sale, how ever, was&nbsp; disapproved by the probate court in its order of September 25,&nbsp; 1948, on the ground that as the parcel of land sought to be sold was the most valuable piece of property forming the estate of the deceased, the sale there of would deplete said estate and render impossible compliance With&nbsp; certain onerous conditions imposed thereon by the will.&nbsp;&nbsp; And making the observation&nbsp; that the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of sale dated April 28, 1947, and attached to the joint motion had&nbsp; all the earmarks of a&nbsp; perfected&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; the court ordered the&nbsp; executor to&nbsp; recover the property, if the sale had&nbsp; been pushed through, and make a return thereof.&nbsp; It is important to note that&nbsp; on <i>May&nbsp; 3, 1949</i>, the executor submitted a report stating that the <i>sale had not been consummated&nbsp; and the land&nbsp; was&nbsp; not delivered to the vendee under&nbsp; the aforementioned deed of sale. </i><br><br>At this juncture, and in anticipation of certain incidents that will be&nbsp; unravelled in the course of this narration of facts, it may be mentioned that on September 9,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1945, or immediately after the filing of the petition for probate of the will, Atty. J. R. Nuguid&nbsp; entered his&nbsp; appearance as counsel for the executor Tomas Tagle.&nbsp; Said lawyer, how ever withdrew his appearance as such counsel on October 16, 1945, allegedly with the consent&nbsp; of his client,&nbsp; and was substituted by Atty. Luis A. Atanacio.&nbsp; On May 14, 1947, Atty. J. R. Nuguid once more entered his appearance in the case, only this time as counsel for Agustin Ignacio, Sr., in collaboration with Atty. D. M. Tan. <br><br>On May&nbsp; 10, 1949, the executor, assisted by Atty. J. R. Nuguid, filed a project of partition duly signed&nbsp; by all the testamentary heirs, liquidating the estate and&nbsp; adjudicating the same in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of the will. This project of partition received&nbsp; court approval&nbsp; on May 18,&nbsp; 1949.&nbsp; At the same time,&nbsp; the executor and&nbsp; Agustin Ignacio, Sr. were directed to comply with the impositions of the will and to institute guardianship&nbsp; proceeding for the minor Agustin Ignacio, Jr., for the purpose of receiving the&nbsp; latter's share&nbsp; of&nbsp; the inheritance.&nbsp; The executor was further ordered to present proof of payment of the estate and inheritance taxes, as well as&nbsp; the receipts by the heirs of their respective shares. <br><br>On October 12,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; two petitions were filed in court: (1) by the&nbsp; executor, assisted by his "attorney of record, Atty.&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; R. Nuguid", praying the&nbsp; court to&nbsp; close&nbsp; the proceedings and order&nbsp; the&nbsp; distribution of the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; in accordance with the project of&nbsp; partition, and (2) a petition to detach from the <i>expediente</i> the disapproved deed of absolute&nbsp; sale which was attached to the joint motion to sell Lot No. 1 of T.C.T. No. 1223,&nbsp; and to substitute the same with a certified copy of the document.&nbsp; Both petitions were granted on October&nbsp; 14, 1949, with a directive to the executor to deliver&nbsp; to&nbsp; all the heirs&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; shares&nbsp; of the estate&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; submit proof&nbsp; of such delivery within five days. <br><br>On September 17, 1951, the Clerk of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Bataan addressed a communication to Tomas Tagle requiring him to explain in five days why he should not be held in contempt of court for having failed to comply with the order of&nbsp; October 14, 1949.&nbsp; In&nbsp; answer thereto, Atty. J. R. Nuguid, signing as counsel for Tomas Tagle, requested that his&nbsp; client be allowed to comply with the aforementioned order&nbsp; until after&nbsp; the national elections (which would&nbsp; be held in&nbsp; November of that year).&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, the executor did&nbsp; not&nbsp; make good&nbsp; his&nbsp; promise because on March&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; 1955, the Deputy&nbsp; Clerk of&nbsp; Court wrote another&nbsp; letter&nbsp; requiring the executor's compliance, in 10 days, with the Court's directive of October 14, 1949. <br><br>The record does not show that the executor has complied with this directive; but it does&nbsp; appear from the subsequent pleadings, filed by the parties that on September 11, 1947, or before the motion for leave to sell the&nbsp; lot described in the&nbsp; deed of sale was denied by the&nbsp; probate court, as mentioned earlier in this decision, a petition for the reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1223,&nbsp; registered in the name of&nbsp; Maria Consuelo Ignacio, was filed by Pastor Manalo&nbsp; (the intended vendee) with the Court of First Instance of Bataan (G. L. R.&nbsp; 0. 315,&nbsp; Cad. Case No. 10), which petition was approved on October 31, 1947; that subsequently another&nbsp; petition for the reconstitution of the same title was filed,&nbsp; this time&nbsp; by Tomas&nbsp; Tagle (G.L.R.O.&nbsp; Rec.&nbsp; 14007), which was also approved by&nbsp; the court on January 20,&nbsp; 1950; and that on the following day, January 21, 1950, Pastor Manalo presented to the Register of Deeds of Bataan, for registration, the deed of absolute sale of Lot No. 1, T.C.T. No. 1223 (which was disapproved by the probate&nbsp; court and&nbsp; was detached from the record of Sp.&nbsp; Proc. No. 1811 upon&nbsp; petition&nbsp; of the&nbsp; executor), supported by certified copies of the orders of the court of October 31, 1947 in G.L.R.O. 315, Cad. Case No. 10,&nbsp; and of January 20,&nbsp; 1950, in G.L.R.O. Rec. No. 14007, reconstituting T.C.T. No. 1223, copies of the project of partition and of the order of the probate court approving the same. As a consequence thereof, a part of Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title No. 1223 was cancelled and a separate title, covering Lot No.&nbsp; 1 thereof, was issued in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pastor Manalo (T.C.T. No. 1999). <br><br>On May 25, 1955, the&nbsp; executor, Tomas Tagle,&nbsp; filed a petition in the probate court asking that the sale to&nbsp; Pastor Manalo of Lot No. 1,&nbsp; T.C.T.&nbsp; No. 1223, be declared null and void; that the certificate of title&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name of said vendee be cancelled, and a new&nbsp; one&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued in his name as&nbsp; such executor of the will of the&nbsp; deceased Maria Consuelo Ignacio, alleging that&nbsp; by reason of&nbsp; undue influence&nbsp; exerted&nbsp; upon&nbsp; him by Agustin Ignacio, Sr., he was induced to sell the land to Pastor Manalo who actually paid only a total&nbsp; of&nbsp; P10,000; that said property was included as one of&nbsp; the properties subject for distribution among the testamentary heirs in the project of partition approved by&nbsp; the court; and that Pastor&nbsp; Manalo knew all along that said property was under administration and the sale thereof disapproved by the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; This petition was opposed by Pastor Manalo who, while&nbsp; admitting that the parcel of land in question appeared in the project of partition as part&nbsp; of the estate to be divided&nbsp; among&nbsp; the heirs and that the sale thereof was disapproved by the probate court, claimed that the&nbsp; ground relied&nbsp; upon by the court in disapproving the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; no longer existed or did not actually exist; that Tomas Tagle entered&nbsp; into the contract of sale because he deemed&nbsp; it more beneficial to him to receive a lump sum than&nbsp; enjoy the usufruct thereof due to his advanced age;&nbsp; that such a petition to recover property could not properly be entertained&nbsp; in a probate court. <br><br>Confronted with these&nbsp; conflicting&nbsp; claims&nbsp; the probate court ordered the cancellation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; title issued in the name of Pastor Manalo and the issuance of another in the name of the executor.&nbsp;&nbsp; From this&nbsp; order, the vendee, Pastor Manalo, appealed to this Court. <br><br>For two reasons, the appealed order should&nbsp; be&nbsp; set aside. Firstly, because from the recital in the narration of facts, it appears that the probate proceedings had already been terminated&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; approval by the probate court of the project of partition submitted by the executor; the granting of the petition to close the proceedings; and the consequent issuance of the order of distribution directing the delivery of&nbsp; the properties&nbsp; to the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; the adjudication made in the will&nbsp; (Santiesteban <i>vs.</i> Santiesteban,&nbsp; 68 Phil., 367).&nbsp; Secondly, even&nbsp; assuming that&nbsp; in view of the lack of proof of compliance&nbsp; by the executor of the order of distribution; of the properties, the proceedings might still be considered as open, the remedy being sought by the executor, that is, the declaration of&nbsp; nullity of the deed of sale and the consequent cancellation of the certificate of title issued in favor of the vendee-petitioner Pastor Manalo cannot be obtained through a mere&nbsp; motion in the probate proceedings over&nbsp; the objection&nbsp; of a third party adversely affected and over whom the probate court had no jurisdiction.&nbsp; The&nbsp; rule is already well settled that "when the&nbsp; demand is&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the administrator and the party against whom it is enforced is a third party not under&nbsp; the court's jurisdiction, the demand can not be&nbsp; by mere motion by the administrator, but by an independent action against the third&nbsp; person"&nbsp; (De Paula&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Escay, 97 Phil., 617; 51 Off. Gaz., [10] 5168).<br><br>Thus,&nbsp; even&nbsp; granting <i>arguendo</i>, that the presentation of the deed of sale for registration in the Register of Deeds and the issuance of a new certificate of title in the name of the vendee were, in view of the circumstances, procured through means far from regular, nevertheless&nbsp; the&nbsp; vendee has acquired, and is actually asserting,&nbsp; a claim of&nbsp; owner ship over the parcel of land covered by said deed&nbsp; of sale and certificate of&nbsp; title of&nbsp; which he can not be deprived except in an appropriate independent action in the&nbsp; proper court. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the order appealed from is hereby set aside, without&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
