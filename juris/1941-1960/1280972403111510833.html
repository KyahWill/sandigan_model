				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Eliodoro Ortega and Victoriano Castillo were charged in the Court 
of First Instance of Zamboanga with the crime of robbery with homicide 
(Case No. 1353).  Eliodoro Ortega was further charged in the same court 
with the crime of illegal possession of firearm (Case No. 1352).  Upon 
arraignment, Ortega pleaded not guilty to the charge of illegal 
possession of firearm, and both Ortega and Castillo also pleaded not 
guilty in the case of robbery with homicide.  However, when the two 
cases were called for a joint trial, Castillo changed his plea to guilty
 with the approval of the court.  After trial, the court, in a single 
decision, found Eliodoro Ortega guilty of illegal possession of firearm 
and sentenced him to two years of imprisonment, to pay a fine of P1,000 
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the 
costs; it likewise found Eliodoro Ortega and Victoriano Castillo guilty 
of robbery with homicide and sentenced each of them to <i>reclusion 
perpetua,</i> to pay the heirs of the deceased Felicito Lagradante in 
the sum of P2,000.00, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, 
and to pay the costs.  From this judgment, both accused appealed.
  <p>    With regard to the crime of illegal possession of firearm, the 
Solicitor General recommends the acquittal of Eliodoro Ortega on the 
strength of Republic Act No. 482 in the light of the evidence presented 
by the prosecution.  It appears that the only evidence against the 
accused is his own confession wherein he states that a homemade 
revolver, caliber .38, was taken in his house on March 13, 1951, which 
he bought for self-defense and that he had no license to possess said 
firearm.  Considering that, under Republic Act No. 482, a person who 
possesses a firearm may, without incurring any liability, surrender the 
same within a period of one year, except when he makes use of it or 
carries it on his person, and the firearm in question was found in the 
house of the accused before the expiration of the period therein 
provided, the recommendation of the Solicitor General is well taken.</p>
  <p>    With regard to the case of robbery with homicide, the evidence 
for the prosecution has established the following facts: On the night of
 March 7, 1951, appellants Eliodoro Ortega and Victoriano Castillo went 
to the house of Felicito Lagradante, who was then a guard of the lumber 
concession of Martha Lumber Company, pretending to ask for some 
cigarette.  Lagradante was at the time preparing chocolate.  After 
offering them cigarette he told them to wait and shortly thereafter 
offered them chocolate.  Suddenly Castillo grabbed a bolo from a table 
and hacked the neck of Lagradante and when the latter offered 
resistance, Castillo continued hacking him until he fell.  Thereafter, 
Ortega got hold of Lagradante's carbine and fired at the latter.  
Believing that Lagradante was already dead, Castillo and Ortega left the
 house taking with them Lagradante's carbine, bolo and flashlight.</p>
  <p>    On March 8, 1951, the incident was reported to the authorities 
by one Ricardo Garus and the cadaver of Lagradante was taken to the city
 of Basilan for an autopsy.  This was performed by Dr. Conrado Yumul, 
Charity physician of Lagmitan, who found the injuries described in his 
report exhibit "B".  On March 11, 1951, a report was received in the 
office of the chief of police of Basilan City that Ortega had sold a 
carbine to a certain moro Hassan several days after the incident and 
policeman Cornelio Cuevas was commissioned to get the carbine.  This was
 done and the carbine of Lagradante was found in Hassan's house.  The 
flashlight of Lagradante was found in the house of Castillo while 
Lagradante's bolo was found about 75 meters from the scene of the 
killing.  When Castillo and Ortega were investigated, both confessed to 
the killing and then and there reenacted the crime.  These facts appear 
in their confessions which were subscribed and sworn to before Municipal
 Judge Doroteo de Guzman.</p>
  <p>    The accused admitted having caused the death of Felicito 
Lagradante but tried to justify the killing by giving the following 
version:  While the two accused were in the house of the deceased, the 
latter told them that he was good in fencing and could kill even five 
persons who dared face him.  To prove it Lagradante took a piece of wood
 and told Ortega to get hold of a bolo.  As Ortega refused, Castillo 
volunteered to take his place.  Thereupon, Lagradante asked Castillo to 
hit him and obligingly the latter raised his right hand and slowly 
brought down the bolo.  Lagradante urged Castillo to hit him harder and 
when he did so Lagradante was not able to parry the blow and was hit on 
the left side of the neck.  Then Castillo thrushed the bolo at 
Lagradante, hitting the latter in the abdomen.  Upon being hit both 
grappled with each other until Lagradante fell down dead.  Ortega took 
the carbine from a corner of the house and pressed its trigger to see if
 it was loaded but he could not tell if the shot hit the deceased.  
Ortega and Castillo left the house bringing with them the carbine and 
flashlight.</p>
  <p>    The version thus given by the accused is too absurd to deserve 
consideration.  It is belied not only by the confessions of the two 
accused but by the nature of the wounds found in the body of the 
deceased.  The report of Dr. Yumul shows that the deceased received 
three incise wounds and one penetrating, besides two gunshot wounds, 
which certainly run counter to those allegedly inflicted by Castillo in 
the fencing demonstration narrated by him.  A circumstance which weakens
 this defense is the fact that Castillo who is given practically the 
whole blame for the killing was not presented to corroborate the 
testimony of Ortega, and instead he pleaded guilty to the charge.</p>
  <p>    The claim that Ortega cannot be held responsible for the death 
of the deceased because the two gunshot wounds he inflicted upon the 
latter were apparently not serious cannot be sustained it appearing that
 Ortega and Castillo have conspired to commit the crime, as shown by the
 fact that both went to the house together and did not leave until after
 they were sure that he was dead.  They went to the house of the 
deceased with the common design of committing the robbery and in 
perpetrating it they cooperated in taking his life.</p>
  <p>    The claim that the confessions of the accused cannot be given 
any evidentiary value because they were not given voluntarily cannot 
also be entertained in the light of the testimony of Municipal Judge 
Doroteo de Guzman and the reenactment of the crime made by them which 
tallied in its essential parts with the facts appearing in said 
confessions.</p>
  <p>    Finding no error in the decision appealed from with regard to 
the crime of robbery with homicide, the same is hereby affirmed, with 
costs.</p>
  <p>    With regard to the charge of illegal possession of firearm, the
 accused is acquitted, with costs de oficio.</p>
