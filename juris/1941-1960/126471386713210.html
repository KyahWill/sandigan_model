				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In special proceedings  No. 70708  of the  Court of First Instance of Manila,  Ramon Joaquin, the  duly  appointed administrator of the estate of the deceased spouses Joaquin Navarro and Angela Joaquin, made and returned to the Court an  amended inventory and  appraisal of all the real and personal properties of the deceased spouses which came into his.possession or knowledge, pursuant to section 1 (a), Rule 82, and section 1, Rule 84.  A parcel of land located  on San  Marcelino street, district  of Ermita,  city of Manila, containing an area of 1,553.20 sq. m., described and delimited in original certificate of  title No.  3377 of the office  of the Registrar of Deeds  in and for  the  city of Manila, was included  in the aforesaid inventory among the paraphernal properties of the late Angela Joaquin.</p>
<p>Antonio C. Navarro, a child of the late Joaquin Navarro, objected to the  characterization  of  the  real  properties listed as Nos. 1, 2, 3  and 4  under the heading of "paraphernal property of  Angela Joaquin" in  the  amended inventory and alleged that said four  lots  belonged to the conjugal partnership of the deceased spouses, especially the parcel of  land designated as No. 4; that the inclusion in the amended inventory of  the alleged  paraphernal properties  consisting  of jewelry,  gold coins, personal  and realty, disposed of during the marriage, was not lawful; and that the  value of the inventoried real estate was not the true  and correct one.</p>
<p>The contending parties in this case  are heirs of the late spouses, the administrator Ramon Joaquin being a son of the late Angela Joaquin, and  the  oppositor Antonio C. Navarro,  a  legitimate child  of  the  late Joaquin  Navarro by  another marriage.</p>
<p>After hearing, the probate court held that the parcels of land known as lot No. 6, block No.  1832, and lot No.  9, block No. 1846, covered by transfer certificate  of title No. 8096 of the office of the Registrar of Deeds in and for the city  of  Manila, and lot  No.  6, block  No. 3001, covered by  transfer  certificate  of title  No. 27669 of the same office, were paraphernal properties of the late Angela Joaquin, but that the parcel of land listed as No. 4 under the heading of "paraphernal property of Angela Joaquin" in the amended, inventory was  conjugal property of the late spouses Joaquin Navarro and Angela Joaquin.   The "value of the jewelry, gold coins and personalty of Angela Joaquin  sold or otherwise disposed of during marriage" was ordered excluded from the inventory because they were not found among the properties left by the deceased spouses.  The probate court directed the administrator to return an amended inventory in accordance with its judgment and  to  furnish the Collector of Internal .Revenue with  a copy  thereof so  that the inventoried properties may be  appraised by the inheritance  tax appraisers  of the Bureau of Internal Revenue,  in accordance with  the provisions  of  section 1, Rule 84.</p>
<p>A motion for reconsideration filed by the administrator, objected to by the oppositor, was denied.  The administrator  appealed.</p>
<p>Upon  motion of the  parties filed  on  19 June  1953, reiterated  on  28 December of the same year  by the appellant, by resolution of 11 January 1954  the appeal was certified by the Court of Appeals to this Court for  the reason that the  issues involved  in the case  are  purely legal.</p>
<p>It appears  that on 18 February 1909 Joaquin Navarro and Angela Joaquin who were about to get married signed in  the presence of two witnesses  and a "notary public  an ante-nuptial agreement  known as <span style="font-style: italic;">capitulaciones  matrimoniales</span> where they listed real estate, cash, jewelry and furniture belonging to Angela  Joaquin and whereby the parties agreed that Angela Joaquin reserved or retained the right to administer (manage)  all her properties listed in  the agreement.  For the purpose  of this opinion the other stipulations need not be restated.  On  20 September 1909 Joaquin Navarro and  Angela Joaquin were united in  marriage (Exhibit 1).  The first three lots tinder the heading of "paraphernal property of  Angela Joaquin" in the amended inventory returned by the  administrator are found among the real properties described in the <span style="font-style: italic;">capituta clones  matrimonidles,</span>  whereas the parcel of  land listed as No. 4, under the same heading in the same inventory is not included in the <span style="font-style: italic;">capitulaciones matrimoniales.</span></p>
<p>The trial court is of the opinion that the parcel of land just referred to  having been  acquired  during the marriage the presumption is that it was conjugal despite the fact that  the registration thereof  was decreed  and the original certificate of title was issued in the name of "Angela Joaquin, the wife of Joaquin Navarro" (Exhibit F); and that  such  presumption has not been  overcome by" any other evidence except by the fact already adverted to that it was decreed  registered in the name of Angela Joaquin.</p>
<p>The administrator contends that the parcel of land listed as  No. 4 under the heading "paraphernal  properly of Angela Joaquin" in the amended inventory returned by him to the  Court must be held paraphernal property of her  deceased  mother,  because the original certificate of title was issued in the name of "Angela Joaquin, the  wife of Joaquin Navarro, of Manila," as a result of land registration proceedings, which is conclusive  against the whole world.  But this contention  runs counter to the rule  laid down in a long line of decisions that  no matter in whose name the property is registered under the Torrens System, Act No. 496, as amended, if acquired  during coverture, the same  must be deemed  conjugal unless it be shown that such  property acquired  during coverture was acquired with  ftinds or  property belonging exclusively to one  of the  spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>   We  hold with the probate court that in this  case such presumption has not been overcome because there is no evidence to that effect.  The administrator indulges in conjecture.  He  states that as there were  seven parcels of land listed in  the <span style="font-style: italic;">capitulaciones matrimonidles</span> and only three  remain,  together  with the fact that there are no more jewelry left by the late Angela Joaquin, he assumes that the proceeds of the sale of those parcels of land and the jewelry were invested in the purchase  of the parcel  of land acquired during coverture and which should be deemed now as he did in  his amended inventory as paraphernal property.   A conjecture is not evidence and  may and  should not he  taken as such to rebut or overthrow the presumption established by  law and jurisprudence.   Besides, such surmise has no foundation,  because among the  six  parcels  of  land described in transfer certificate of title No. 2297 that belonged to the late Angela Joaquin as paraphernal, Lot D was partly sold on 29 November 1916 and the rest thereof on 31 August 1943, Lot A was sold on 9 July 1917 and Lot B was sold on 5 January  1913,  whereas original certificate  of  title  No. 3377 covering the  parcel of land listed as No. 4 under the heading of "paraphernal property of Angela Joaquin" in the amended inventory, was issued on 20  September 1916. So the proceeds realized out of the sales of Lots  D and A subsequent to the issuance  of  original  certificate of title No. 3377 could not have been  used to  acquire the parcel of  land  in question.  Furthermore,  in connection  with the decree  of registration which is conclusive against the whole world, the administrator overlooked the provisions of section 70, Act No. 496,  which expressly provides that * *  * Nothing contained in this  Act shall in any way be construed to relieve registered land or the owners thereof from any rights incident to the relation  of husband  and wife, * * *."</p>
<p>As to the inclusion in the amended inventory  of the "value of the jewelry  * *  * of Angela Joaquin sold or otherwise disposed of during marriage," the probate court held that the objection  to its  inclusion by the  oppositor Antonio  C.  Navarro  is  well taken, because  the  administrator admitted that the same were  disposed of during the marriage, for they were not found  among the properties left by the deceased spouses.  The inventory should include only properties existing at the time of the death of the spouses, except when the husband had been entrusted with the administration of the wife's .paraphernal property, in which case such property should  be included in the inventory for the restitution  thereof.  This case does not fall under the exception because the  wife  had reserved  the right to administer and manage all her paraphernal properties.  The opinion of the probate court on this  point is correct, because  section 1 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>), Rule 82,  and section 1, Rule 84, make it incumbent  upon  the administrator  to return  to  the  Court within three months  a true inventory  and appraisal of all the real and personal properties of a deceased person which came into his possession or knowledge.   As these jewelry, gold coins  and personal  property were  not found among the  assets or properties of the  deceased  spouses at the time  of their death, the same could not have come  into the possession of the administrator.   As  to  his knowledge  of  all the real  and personal properties of  the deceased spouses,  it refers to his knowledge of the existence of such properties in possession of others.</p>
