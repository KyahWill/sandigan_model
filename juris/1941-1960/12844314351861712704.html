Vicente&nbsp;&nbsp; also&nbsp; struck Teodorico&nbsp; in reply&nbsp; but the&nbsp; latter was not hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teodorico&nbsp; then ran away and hid behind&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; grasses, about 4 meters&nbsp; away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his hiding place&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; saw&nbsp; that Numoriano, Jose and Vicente&nbsp;&nbsp; continued beating Banaay while&nbsp; Galixto Llanzon and Ramon Burce&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; stoning him. After Teodorico had recognized them,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; left and went to&nbsp; the&nbsp; house of his&nbsp; cousin Daniela Barrameda and related&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; incident identifying Jose,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano,&nbsp;&nbsp; Yicente,&nbsp; Ramon and Calixto&nbsp; as Cayetano's&nbsp; assailants. Teodorico&nbsp; also&nbsp; repaired&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; house of Josefina Bonita and told her&nbsp; that her uncle&nbsp; Cayetano Banaay was killed by the&nbsp; aforementioned 5 persons.<br><br>On the&nbsp; following morning,&nbsp; May 15,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp;&nbsp; at about 8:00 o'clock,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano Balines accompanied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; barrio Lieuten­ant Warciso Hint surrendered to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; of Police,&nbsp;&nbsp; Porfirio Pantalla,&nbsp;&nbsp; and confessed&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; struck somebody. Thereupon,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; of Police&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanied&nbsp; by Dr.&nbsp; Felix Macalino,&nbsp;&nbsp; charity physician oi&nbsp; Sipocot,&nbsp;&nbsp; Camarines Sur,&nbsp;&nbsp; a photographer&nbsp; and Numeriano went&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; scene&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; crime and there&nbsp; found the&nbsp;&nbsp; dead body of&nbsp; Cayetano Banaay. A picture&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; cadaver of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; A)&nbsp; was taken at the&nbsp; place&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; incident,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Macalino&nbsp; conducted n post mortem examination and made&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; following report;<br><blockquote>(a) Fracture of the occipital portion of the skull exposing the brain followed by profuse hemorrharges;<br><br>(b) Blood exit from the mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp; ears,&nbsp;&nbsp; and nose;<br><br>(c) Multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; contusions and swelling all over&nbsp; the&nbsp; face;<br><br>(d) Swelling with hematama at&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; neck (back)&nbsp;&nbsp; - Exhibit C,</blockquote>After&nbsp; due&nbsp;&nbsp; investigation and proper proceedings,&nbsp;&nbsp; a complaint was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Court of First Instances( of Camarines Sur&nbsp;&nbsp; charging Humsri.ano Balines,&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Balines, Vicente Armaza,.&nbsp; Baraon Burce&nbsp;&nbsp; and Calixto Llanzon with the crime&nbsp;&nbsp; of murder&nbsp;&nbsp; qualified&nbsp; by&nbsp; treachery. After hearing, the Court found defendants&nbsp; guilty as&nbsp;&nbsp; charged in the&nbsp;&nbsp; information and each of&nbsp;&nbsp; them was&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp;&nbsp; the penalty of reclusion perpetua,&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; exception of&nbsp; Ramon Burce who,&nbsp;&nbsp; being&nbsp; a minor 17&nbsp;&nbsp; years&nbsp; old,&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; a penalty one&nbsp;&nbsp; degree&nbsp; lower,&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; Article&nbsp;&nbsp; 68&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; to&nbsp; 14 years&nbsp; and 8 months of reclusion temporal;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the accessory penalties prescribed in Article 41&nbsp; of&nbsp; said legal&nbsp;&nbsp; body to pay&nbsp; jointly and&nbsp; severally P3,000.00 as indemnity to&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of&nbsp; Cayetano Banaay;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; to pay one-fifth of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; costs.<br><br>From this&nbsp; verdict&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; appealed to Us and in this&nbsp; instance&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp;&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; interposes the&nbsp;&nbsp; defense of&nbsp; alibi&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; all the&nbsp;&nbsp; accused,&nbsp;&nbsp; except Numeriano Balines who&nbsp;&nbsp; claims&nbsp; self-defense.<br><br>In&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts&nbsp;&nbsp; stated at&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning of this&nbsp; decision,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; prosecution further established the motive&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; assault upon Cayetano Banaay, which is&nbsp; disclosed by the&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony of Josefina Bonita,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We copy from the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision appealed from the&nbsp;&nbsp; following:<br><blockquote>“She&nbsp;&nbsp; (Josefina Bonita)&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that previous&nbsp; to May 14,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano Balines had been making love&nbsp;&nbsp; to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one&nbsp; occasion,&nbsp;&nbsp; while she was&nbsp;&nbsp; alone&nbsp;&nbsp; in the&nbsp; house,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano&nbsp; attempted to&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; her. The&nbsp;&nbsp; arrival&nbsp; of&nbsp; her&nbsp; sister,&nbsp;&nbsp; who come&nbsp;&nbsp; in response to her&nbsp; cries&nbsp; for help,&nbsp;&nbsp; frustrated Numeriano's&nbsp; design,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since&nbsp;&nbsp; then,&nbsp;&nbsp; she&nbsp; was&nbsp; forbidden&nbsp; by her uncle&nbsp;&nbsp; and mother&nbsp;&nbsp; to have&nbsp;&nbsp; any&nbsp; dealings with&nbsp; Nume r ian o.<br><br>"Josefina further&nbsp;&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that on April 16, 19 54,&nbsp;&nbsp; she met Mumeriano&nbsp; and Jose&nbsp; Balines&nbsp; in Sipocot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano proposed that&nbsp; she&nbsp; elope with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon her refusal, they told her that they will kill her uncle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She met them again,&nbsp;&nbsp; together with.&nbsp; Calixto Llanzon,&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp; a dance&nbsp; on May 10,&nbsp;&nbsp; and on that occasion they inquired about h6r uncle. On May 14&nbsp; (1954),&nbsp;&nbsp; she&nbsp; observed that th6&nbsp; 5&nbsp; accused, who were all&nbsp; at the dance&nbsp;&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; Dagupan Sawmill, (would)&nbsp;&nbsp; get&nbsp; together&nbsp; and&nbsp; then look at her uncle."</blockquote>Numeriano Balines admitted having killed&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased but in self-defense,&nbsp; His version of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; incident,&nbsp;&nbsp; as narrated in the&nbsp; decision and adopted by his&nbsp;&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; as follows;<br><blockquote>"x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that after&nbsp; the&nbsp; dance&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Dagupan Sawmill,&nbsp;&nbsp; which he&nbsp; attended,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; left for his house at about 11:00&nbsp; or 12:00 p.m. On his&nbsp; way home,&nbsp;&nbsp; some 200 meters from the&nbsp; dance hall,&nbsp;&nbsp; he was attacked by two men,&nbsp;&nbsp; armed with pieces of wood,&nbsp; who suddenly came&nbsp; out of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; bushes„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; them struck him, but he&nbsp;&nbsp; dodged and was not hit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before&nbsp;&nbsp; they could strike him again,&nbsp;&nbsp; he managed&nbsp; to&nbsp; turn back and escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After running some&nbsp;&nbsp; 60 meters,&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; stumbled on stones, He picked up a stone&nbsp; and threw it at Banaay who was hit,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Banaay went down squatting and dropped the piece&nbsp; of wood he&nbsp; was&nbsp; carrying. Numeriano picked it up,&nbsp;&nbsp; and as he&nbsp;&nbsp; saw Banaay&nbsp; stand up,&nbsp; he hit him in the&nbsp; region of&nbsp; the&nbsp; right ear&nbsp; and in the&nbsp; left forearm,,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; left forearm was also hit because&nbsp;&nbsp; Banaay parried&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; blow with his&nbsp; left hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; the&nbsp; first blow Banaay reeled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he did&nbsp; so,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano&nbsp; struck him again hitting him on the&nbsp;&nbsp; back of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano&nbsp; clubbed him for the&nbsp;&nbsp; third&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp; but he&nbsp;&nbsp; does&nbsp; not know where&nbsp;&nbsp; this blow landed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp;&nbsp; approached the man he&nbsp; hit but did not recognize him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; then fled and surrendered to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; barrio lieutenant of South Villazor."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp;&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court,&nbsp;&nbsp; however,&nbsp;&nbsp; did not give&nbsp;&nbsp; any&nbsp; credence to&nbsp;&nbsp; this version for according to His Honor;<br><blockquote>"This&nbsp; account of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; incident by Numeriano Balines&nbsp; is&nbsp; difficult to&nbsp; believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is&nbsp; true that two men,&nbsp;&nbsp; who&nbsp; from all&nbsp; appearances&nbsp; were&nbsp; out to&nbsp; kill him,&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly emerged from the&nbsp;&nbsp; bushes. and attacked him and he&nbsp; was alone&nbsp; and unarmed, it&nbsp; is highly improbable&nbsp;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; not only was not hit but that he&nbsp;&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; able&nbsp;&nbsp; to- turn back,&nbsp;&nbsp; escape&nbsp; unscatched,&nbsp;&nbsp; and later&nbsp; kill one&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; them with his" own weapon,<br><br>"Besides&nbsp; being highly&nbsp; improbable,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano's story is furthermore&nbsp; confused and full of inconsistencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; declared that&nbsp; before&nbsp; he&nbsp; was struck,&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; did not see&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone&nbsp; and that his assailants&nbsp; suddenly&nbsp; came&nbsp;&nbsp; out of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; bushes&nbsp; on the&nbsp;&nbsp; side of the&nbsp; road;&nbsp;&nbsp; later,&nbsp; he&nbsp; stated that he&nbsp;&nbsp; saw his assailants when they were&nbsp;&nbsp; still about five meters away from him,&nbsp;&nbsp; standing on the&nbsp; road.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp;&nbsp; said he was not hit for he&nbsp; parried&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; blow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; explained he&nbsp; was&nbsp; not hit because&nbsp; he ducked".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In direct examination&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; testified that he fell as lie&nbsp;&nbsp; stumbled on stones,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in cross-examination,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; asserted that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; fell&nbsp; because lie&nbsp; was running fast and the&nbsp; road was&nbsp; small and somewhat descending,<br><br>"Asked why he&nbsp; did not&nbsp; shout for help&nbsp; since he&nbsp; was only 140 meters&nbsp; from the&nbsp;&nbsp; dance&nbsp; hall where there&nbsp; might&nbsp; still be&nbsp;&nbsp; some&nbsp; people,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; answered that if he&nbsp;&nbsp; shouted his&nbsp; speed would have&nbsp;&nbsp; been retarded (how he&nbsp;&nbsp; did not explain),&nbsp;&nbsp; but later he&nbsp;&nbsp; said he did not shout because&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased might have other&nbsp; companions&nbsp; and if&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; (Numeriano)&nbsp;&nbsp; shouted, they might join in the&nbsp; attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In.&nbsp; the&nbsp; examination-in-chief,&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; declared that he hit the&nbsp; deceased as he&nbsp;&nbsp; saw him stand up while&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; cross-examination,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; swore&nbsp;&nbsp; that he&nbsp;&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; the&nbsp; first blow when the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased was&nbsp; already&nbsp; standing,&nbsp;&nbsp; set&nbsp; to fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp;&nbsp; testified that he&nbsp; hit the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased for&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; third time&nbsp; while he was reeling from the second blow but after&nbsp; a while&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp; that he&nbsp; hit Banaay for&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; third&nbsp; time&nbsp; after he&nbsp; fell from the second blow,&nbsp;&nbsp; with his&nbsp; body bent forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp;&nbsp; disclosed&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; direct examination that Banany&nbsp; dropped his&nbsp; club when he&nbsp; was&nbsp; in a squatting position after being hit by the&nbsp;&nbsp; stone&nbsp; whereas&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; cross-examination he&nbsp; manifested&nbsp; that he&nbsp;&nbsp; does&nbsp; not know whether the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased dropped his&nbsp;&nbsp; clud when he&nbsp; was&nbsp; standing or&nbsp;&nbsp; squatting.<br><br>"The&nbsp;&nbsp; injuries found upon the&nbsp;&nbsp; body of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased also&nbsp; furnish&nbsp; convincing evidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; falsity of Numeriano's&nbsp; testimony.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; findings of&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Macalino show that the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased had no&nbsp; injuries either&nbsp; in the&nbsp; right ear or&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; left forearm which he&nbsp;&nbsp; should have&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; true,&nbsp;&nbsp; as Numeriano&nbsp;&nbsp; claims,&nbsp;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; hit him in those&nbsp;&nbsp; parts&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; body with&nbsp; the&nbsp; first blow. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano&nbsp; did not&nbsp; state&nbsp;&nbsp; that he hit Banany in the&nbsp; face&nbsp;&nbsp; and yet,&nbsp;&nbsp; according to&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Macalino,&nbsp;&nbsp; he had multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; contusions&nbsp; and&nbsp; swelling all over&nbsp; the face,&nbsp;&nbsp; indicating that he&nbsp;&nbsp; was hit many times&nbsp; in the face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeriano&nbsp; Balines&nbsp;&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that he&nbsp;&nbsp; gave Cayetano Banaay four&nbsp; blows one&nbsp; with a stone&nbsp;&nbsp; and three with the&nbsp; wooden&nbsp; club.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; true&nbsp;&nbsp; then Banaay should have&nbsp;&nbsp; only four&nbsp; injuries&nbsp; in his&nbsp; body but&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; findings&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Macalino&nbsp; disclose&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the deceased had more&nbsp;&nbsp; than four&nbsp; injuries, for&nbsp; be aides the&nbsp; fracture&nbsp;&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; skull,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; swelling at the&nbsp;&nbsp; neck, he had,&nbsp;&nbsp; as already mentioned,&nbsp;&nbsp; many contusions and swelling all over&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; f ace „&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; incontrovertible proof&nbsp; that the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased was hit more&nbsp;&nbsp; than four times,&nbsp;&nbsp; giving the&nbsp; lie&nbsp;&nbsp; to Numeriano' s&nbsp; assertion&nbsp; that he&nbsp;&nbsp; received only four&nbsp; blows&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; confirming Teodorico Bergonio's&nbsp; declaration&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased was hit&nbsp; by the&nbsp;&nbsp; five&nbsp;&nbsp; accused many times.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp; between Numeriano Salines&nbsp; and Teodorico Bergonio, the&nbsp;&nbsp; latter undoubtedly&nbsp; is&nbsp; the more&nbsp;&nbsp; reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; clearer,&nbsp; more consistent and more&nbsp;&nbsp; probable&nbsp;&nbsp; than that&nbsp; of&nbsp; Numeriano. He&nbsp;&nbsp; is not indicted for murder. He&nbsp;&nbsp; is not related to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased nor has&nbsp; any reason been shown why he&nbsp;&nbsp; should falsely testify to a&nbsp; charge that may bring death&nbsp; to five men against not one of whom he harbors any feelings of hate&nbsp; or resentment.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact that Teodorico Bergonio&nbsp; stated that it was full moon on May 14,&nbsp;&nbsp; when according to the&nbsp;&nbsp; calendar,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; moon was not full until&nbsp; the 18th does not materially impair his&nbsp;&nbsp; credibility. The error is plainly an innocent mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is one&nbsp;&nbsp; anybody&nbsp; is&nbsp; likely to fall&nbsp; into,&nbsp;&nbsp; for where&nbsp;&nbsp; the moon is&nbsp; already big and high in the&nbsp;&nbsp; sky,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; it was at about 11:00 or 12;00 o'clock in the&nbsp; night of May 14 when Cayetano Banany was attacked,&nbsp;&nbsp; it is difficult to&nbsp;&nbsp; say,&nbsp;&nbsp; without consulting a calendar, whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; moon&nbsp; is full or&nbsp; about&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; full."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Decision,&nbsp;&nbsp; pp.&nbsp;&nbsp; 46-49,&nbsp;&nbsp; rec,).</blockquote>As to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of&nbsp; alibi interposed by the&nbsp;&nbsp; other appellants,&nbsp; the Courts have&nbsp; already held that such defense is&nbsp; the&nbsp; weakest that an accused can avail of&nbsp; and&nbsp; cannot prosper when the&nbsp;&nbsp; accused as&nbsp; in this&nbsp;&nbsp; case,&nbsp;&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; been positively and properly identified,&nbsp;&nbsp; when the&nbsp; presence&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; all<br>the appellants at the Dagupan Sawmill dance was established by the testimony of Josefina Bonita and when the identification of all the accused as the assailants was established by the testimony of Teodorico Bergonio who knew them very well. Alibi should be proved by proper evidence which would reasonably satisfy the Court of the of such defense (U.S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Oxiles, 29 Phil. 587). Oral proof of alibi must be clearly and satisfactorily established because it is so easily manufactured and is usually so unrealible that it cannot be given credit (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Badilla et al., 48 Phil. 710).<br><br>As may be&nbsp;&nbsp; seen from the&nbsp; foregoing considerations,&nbsp;&nbsp; there is&nbsp; conflict between&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; produced by&nbsp; the prosecution and the&nbsp;&nbsp; defense. This&nbsp; conflict involves&nbsp; a&nbsp; question of&nbsp; credibility of&nbsp; the&nbsp; witnesses presented by both parties,&nbsp; which depends to a large measure on the&nbsp;&nbsp; sound discretion of the&nbsp; trial Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been repeatedly held in this&nbsp; jurisdiction that;<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; appellate&nbsp;&nbsp; court will not disturb&nbsp; the findings of fact made&nbsp;&nbsp; by the&nbsp;&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court as&nbsp; to the&nbsp;&nbsp; credibility of witnesses,&nbsp;&nbsp; in view of its opportunity to observe&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp; demeanor&nbsp; and&nbsp; con-&nbsp; -duct while&nbsp;&nbsp; testifying and that the&nbsp;&nbsp; said findings will generally be&nbsp;&nbsp; accepted and acted upon&nbsp; (people <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Borbano,&nbsp;&nbsp; 76 Phil.&nbsp;&nbsp; 702,&nbsp;&nbsp; citing People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> De Asis,&nbsp;&nbsp; 61 Phil.&nbsp;&nbsp; 642;&nbsp; People&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Garcia,&nbsp;&nbsp; 63 Phil. 296; People&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Masim,&nbsp;&nbsp; 64 Phil,&nbsp;&nbsp; 757&nbsp; and many others).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor will&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellate&nbsp;&nbsp; court reverse any findings of fact by the&nbsp;&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court made upon conflicting testimony and dependent solely upon the&nbsp;&nbsp; credibility of&nbsp; witnesses,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; the court below failed to&nbsp; take&nbsp; into&nbsp;&nbsp; consideration some material fact or&nbsp;&nbsp; circumstance presented to&nbsp; it for&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; (U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Ambrosio,&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 Phil.&nbsp;&nbsp; 295;&nbsp;&nbsp; U.
