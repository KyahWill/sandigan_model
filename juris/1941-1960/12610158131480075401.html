				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from&nbsp; an order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila, Hon. Bienvenido A.&nbsp; Tan, presiding", dismissing the&nbsp; complaint upon motion of&nbsp; defendant Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc.<br><br>In the first cause of action of plaintiff-appellant's complaint he alleges that defendant Mamerto Tingson, a planter adherent,to the&nbsp; defendant-appellee Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc., obtained from the latter a crop loan of P27,640.00 on&nbsp; the condition that Tingson&nbsp; post a&nbsp; bond&nbsp; equivalent to 25% of the crop&nbsp; loan;&nbsp; that in compliance with said requirement, plaintiff-appellant, at the request of Tingson, executed&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; defendant-appellee a surety bond in the amount of P6,910 to guaranty the payment of 25% of the&nbsp; crop loan extended; that among the&nbsp; provisions of the surety bond&nbsp; are the following:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; "1. The&nbsp; obligee,&nbsp; in accepting this bond, binds&nbsp; itself and agrees that the share of&nbsp; the principal in&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceeds of the harvest of the&nbsp; principal's crop for which&nbsp; the&nbsp; crop loan hereby covered has been granted&nbsp; by the obligee&nbsp; shall be utilized to the full amount of such share towards the&nbsp; liquidation,&nbsp; settlement and&nbsp; payment of principal's indebtedness on account of such crop loan and until such indebtedness is hereby fully covered&nbsp; no part of such principal's share&nbsp; shall be utilized to liquidate, settle and pay any indebtedness of the principal on account of any other crop loan which might have been granted to the principal prior to&nbsp; the execution hereof.<br><br>"2. The obligee further&nbsp; agrees not to grant hereafter&nbsp; any additional loan to the principal in excess of the share of the principal in the expected income from the principal's&nbsp; harvest during&nbsp; the crop year&nbsp; or&nbsp; season covered&nbsp; thereby without the prior written consent of the surety.<br><br>"3. The liability of the ASSOCIATED INSURANCE &amp; SURETY COMPANY, INC., under&nbsp; this bond will&nbsp; expire upon complete&nbsp; payment by the principal and/or said surety of whatever debit balance may remain of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid crop&nbsp; loan,&nbsp; but&nbsp; only&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid limit&nbsp; of&nbsp; P6.910.00, upon liquidation of the Bacolod-Murcia&nbsp; Milling&nbsp; Company. Inc. of the said crop loan pursuant to the terms thereof.<br><br>"4. NOW, THEREFORE if the&nbsp; above bounden principal shall in all respects dully&nbsp; and fully&nbsp; observe and perform all and singular the terms and conditions of the Chattel Mortgage executed in favor of the Bacolod-Murcia&nbsp; Milling Company,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; onâ€”for the crop&nbsp; year 1953-1954, then&nbsp; this obligation&nbsp; shall be null and void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect."<br></blockquote>that&nbsp; defendant-appellee,&nbsp; in violation of express terms of the&nbsp; bond, issued to Tingson&nbsp; a loan much more&nbsp; in&nbsp; excess of the&nbsp; planter's expected income from his harvest&nbsp; during the crop year for which the crop loan was granted, without&nbsp; the prior&nbsp; consent of&nbsp; the surety; that&nbsp; in accordance with paragraph 1 of the&nbsp; terms of the bond, defendant-appellee should have notified appellant of the amount which Tingson had&nbsp; obtained from the credit line granted to&nbsp; him under the crop&nbsp; loan agreement;&nbsp; that also&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to the above-quoted condition appellee should have&nbsp; advised&nbsp; appellant of the actual&nbsp; proceeds from the&nbsp; harvest&nbsp; of Tingson and notified appellant in advance&nbsp; of the sale and disposition of the sugar of the appellee&nbsp; so that appellant may know its&nbsp; liability and adequately protect its interest;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that appellee failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; give the notice required in paragraphs 5 and 7 of the complaint, in violation of the terms and conditions of&nbsp; the surety bond.<br><br>In&nbsp; its second cause of action, appellant alleges that it is&nbsp; a&nbsp; condition <span style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non</span> of the surety bond agreement that appellee should extend to Tingson loans that will be utilized exclusively for planting, clearing, cultivation and harvesting the crop of the planter&nbsp; for the crop year for which the loan&nbsp; was granted&nbsp; and that in violation&nbsp; of the latter deliberately utilized for purposes&nbsp; other than those mentioned in the agreement and herein above mentioned; that as a result&nbsp; of the illegal diversion of the loan Tingson was not able to produce crops sufficient&nbsp; to cover the loan under the agreement;&nbsp; that if such diversion was not made Tingson could have planted in the ordinary course of events more crops than&nbsp; he had&nbsp; actually harvested,&nbsp; thereby&nbsp; relieving appellant&nbsp; of responsibility&nbsp; or liability under the bond.<br><br>As an alternative cause, it is alleged that simultaneously with the execution of the surety bond, defendants Anlap and Cabiles acted as indemnitors in&nbsp; favor of the appellant; that Tingson failed to liquidate&nbsp; in full the loan which he had obtained&nbsp; from the appellee, of which loan&nbsp; 25% was guaranted by the appellant; that appellant was notified by appellee that&nbsp; the&nbsp; planter&nbsp; had an outstanding balance of P20,000, and demand was made by the latter to the former for the payment of P6,910 under the terms of the surety bond; that&nbsp; in the event appellant&nbsp; becomes liable&nbsp; to&nbsp; the appellee under the provisions of the agreement, appellant would have a good and valid cause of action against&nbsp; the defendant planter, and defendants Anlap and Cabiles; and that&nbsp; defendants Anlap and&nbsp; Cabiles had also undertaken to pay 15% of the amount due to&nbsp; the appellant, by way of liquidated damages.&nbsp; It is prayed that appellant be relieved of the&nbsp; obligation under the first and second causes of action, and by&nbsp; way of alternative,&nbsp; that planter Tingson and his&nbsp; indemnitors&nbsp; be required to&nbsp; pay the amount required to be&nbsp; paid from the&nbsp; appellant, with damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>Appellee Bacolod-Murcia moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the cause of action of plaintiff surety has not yet accrued, inasmuch as there has been no allegation whatsoever that the plaintiff has voluntarily paid, or been made to pay the amount&nbsp; guaranteed by it, and that the allegations in the complaint&nbsp; are&nbsp; matters&nbsp; of defense. The court below sustained the above motion and dismissed the complaint, and upon its refusal to reconsider its order of dismissal, the present appeal was brought to this Court.<br><br>The&nbsp; appeal must be sustained.&nbsp; The&nbsp; indemnity agreement contains an express obligation of the&nbsp; obligee Bacolod-Murcia not to grant any&nbsp; loan to&nbsp; the planter in excess of the latter's share in&nbsp; the&nbsp; crop harvest without&nbsp; the prior written consent of the surety.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that the defendant milling company violated this express provision of the bond, giving Tingson an amount as loan much more in excess of his expected income during the crop year, without appellant's prior written consent.<br><br>In the&nbsp; second cause of&nbsp; action, it is alleged in the complaint&nbsp; that the condition&nbsp; of the agreement was&nbsp; that ;the loan&nbsp; to be extended Tingson was to be used exclusively for clearing,&nbsp; planting,&nbsp; cultivating and harvesting the crop year, but that appellee allowed Tingson to utilize the loan for purpose other than those specified, by reason of which Tingson was&nbsp; not able&nbsp; to produce crops sufficient to cover the loan.&nbsp; The truth of the allegations of the complaint must be&nbsp; assumed, in a motion&nbsp; to dismiss, and&nbsp; if it was true that there was an agreement that, the loan would be utilized only&nbsp; for clearing, planting,&nbsp; cultivating and harvesting, but that defendant company gave loans deliberately used for&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; other than those, mentioned,&nbsp; as a result&nbsp; of which Tingson&nbsp; was not able to get an income sufficient to cover the&nbsp; loan, then there was a violation of the agreement.<br><br>Under&nbsp; the&nbsp; first cause of action,&nbsp; the appellee has violated an express condition&nbsp; of the indemnity agreement; under the second cause of action, there was also a violation of an alleged condition <i>sine&nbsp; qua non</i> of the same agreement.<br><br>These&nbsp; violations are a breach of&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms of the agreement and produce a right of action in favor of the plaintiff-appellant.&nbsp; It is true that appellant has not yet paid any amount under the indemnity agreement, but&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; also alleged that&nbsp; a demand for the payment&nbsp; of the sum of P6,910 has already been made upon it&nbsp; (par. 16, complaint). It is also true that the allegations made by the appellant in its complaint could be used as defenses&nbsp; in&nbsp; action for the&nbsp; recovery of the said&nbsp; amount, but&nbsp; that is&nbsp; no reason for holding that plaintiff-appellant has no cause of action.<br><br>The purpose of appellant's&nbsp; action is to obtain a&nbsp; release from liability under the terms of the agreement, and the cancellation of the bond (See Rec. on Appeal, p.&nbsp; 11).&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to this&nbsp; relief is justified by a breach of the terms of the agreement.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations, the order of dismissal appealed&nbsp; from should be, as it is hereby,&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; and set aside, and the case is&nbsp; remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against the appellee.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.
