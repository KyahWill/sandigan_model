				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a judgment in a detainer ease rendered in favor of the tenant. </p><p>In November, 1944, after the Japanese occupants had vacated apartment No. 1382, Dos Castillas street, Manila, appellee occupied it and paid appellant a monthly rental of P30. In May, 1945, appellant gave appellee notice to vacate it. </p><p>There being no agreement as to the term of the lease and the rent being paid monthly, it is understood that it is from month to month.&nbsp; The lease ends upon expiration of the term without necessity of special notice (art. 1581, C. C.; Estrella v. Sangalang, G. R. No. L-65, Feb. 6, 1946; Buhay v. Cobarrubias, G. R. No. L-43, Feb. 27, 1946; Co Tiamco v. Diaz, etc., et al., 42 Off. Gaz., 1169). </p><p>The fact that there was a housing shortage in Manila could not defeat the right of the lessor to recover possession of the leased premises. Social justice applies to both -- landlord and tenant. To provide shelter for a brother, as was appellant's purpose when she brought this action against appellee, is a natural feeling and it cannot certainly be held to constitute a violation of any right or principle that the social-justice clause of the Constitution purports or designs to safeguard. </p><p>Judgment is reversed and one will be entered ordering appellee to vacate the leased premises, to pay P30 a month from July, 1945, to the date when he shall have vacated it, with costs against him.</p><p><em>Paras, Pablo, Perfecto</em>, and<em> Hilado, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
