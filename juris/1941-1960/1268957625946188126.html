				<H3>BIBIANA T. VDA. DE INFANTE AND FEDERICO T. INFANTE, PETITIONERS AND APPELLEES, VS. RUPERTO JAVIER, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE COURT OF SAN ENRIQUE, AND DEOGRACIAS E. LERMA, REPRESENTATIVE OF TENANCY LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Occidental Negros requiring the respondent justice of the peace of 
San Enrique, same province, to issue writs of execution in civil cases numbered 
8 and 9 of his docket. The decision also enjoins the respondent Chief of the 
Tenancy Division of the Department of Justice to refrain from interfering in the 
same cases.
<p align="justify">The main issue concerns the jurisdiction to dispose of a 
controversy in which the landlord seeks to deprive his tenant of possession of 
the farm. Appellants claim exclusive jurisdiction for the Department of Justice, 
whereas the appellees maintain that the justice of the peace has 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">It appears that on April 17, 1947, Bibiana T. Vda. de Infante 
and Federico T. Infante (petitioners-appellees) filed complaints for ejectment 
in civil cases Nos. 8 and 9 of the justice of the peace court of San Enrique, 
Occidental Negros. After due hearing the court rendered judgment ordering the 
defendants therein, Lorenzo Fimeza, et al., to vacate the premises. These were 
tenants of plaintiff who had returned to their farm after having been driven 
away. Defendant's attorney received copy of the decision on May 20, 1947.</p>
<p align="justify">However, on May 8, 1947, Lorenzo Fimeza and companions filed 
with the Tenancy Law Enforcement Division of the Department of Justice 
(hereafter referred to as Tenancy Division) complaints against Bibiana T. Vda. 
de Infante in volving the same parties and properties described in the justice 
of the peace cases Nos. 8 and 9. And on May 25, 1947, the petitioners and their 
tenants agreed to submit their dispute to the Tenancy Division in a written 
stipulation which reads partly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"3. That the complainant tenants objected to the jurisdiction 
of J. P. to hear and decide the ordinary civil cases of ejectment as these cases 
are tenancy cases and the objection of the tenants and the J. P. overruled such 
objection and hence the decision. (Annex 'A'.)</p>
<p align="justify">"4. That the parties agree to submit their above entitled cases 
upon the strength of the stipulation of facts and should the Dept. rule that the 
proceedings had by the J. P. were irregular, to set the above entitled cases for 
reinvestigation. In case of the contrary the parties also agree to abide with 
the decision.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. That the tenants agree to respect the bond filed by the 
respondent landlord in order to secure the temporary possession and use of the 
land involved pending final decision of the case by Dept. with respect to these 
cases."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, having been duly informed by the Department of 
Justice of the provisions of Act No. 461 and its circulars on the subject, the 
justice of the peace of San Enrique declared in an order of August 20, 1947, 
that its actuations in civil cases Nos. 8 and 9 were of no effect and value.</p>
<p align="justify">On December 4, 1947, the Tenancy Division found after 
investigation, for the tenants and issued corresponding orders in their favor. 
Nevertheless, on December 20, 1947, petitioners moved in the justice of the 
peace court for execution of the ouster judgment in the cases numbered 8 and 9. 
Denial of such motion, gave rise to the instant special civil action for 
mandamus and for injunction, which has been favorably acted upon by the lower 
court.</p>
<p align="justify">The respondents appealed, and their main arguments turn around 
the proposition that conflicts between land owners and their tenants as to 
possession or cultivation of the farms do not fall within the jurisdiction of 
the justice of the peace courts, because such controversies have been placed by 
law under the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice by Commonwealth Act No. 
461, as amended, which reads partly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Any agreement or provision of law to the contrary 
notwithstanding, in all cases where land is held under any system of tenancy the 
tenant shall not be dispossessed of the land cultivated by him except for any of 
the causes mentioned in section nineteen of Act Numbered Four thousand and 
fifty-four or for any just cause, and without the approval of a representative 
of the Department of Justice duly authorized for the purpose. The Department of 
Justice is, likewise, charged with the duty of enforcing all the laws, orders 
and regulations relating to any system of tenancy and it may issue such orders 
as may be necessary in pursuance thereof, * * *." (Sec. 1, Republic Act No. 
44.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In a decision promulgated on May 30, 1949 we concluded that in 
view of the above statute, a justice of the peace has presently no jurisdiction 
to entertain complaints for ejectment or illegal detention by landlords against 
their share-croppers or tenants (Ojo, vs. Jamito, G. R. No. L-1511). That 
decision, penned after this appeal had been submitted and argued, is of course 
conclusive on the question at issue herein. The justice of the peace of San 
Enrique had no jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">There is truly much to be said in support of the trial judge's 
view and of appellee's contention that the legislature may not deprive courts of 
their judicial function. But as we declared in the above-mentioned opinion 
"there is no doubt that Congress has power to diminish the jurisdiction of the 
Courts of First Instance" (and of justice of the peace courts), and "confer the 
jurisdiction in question upon the Department of Justice, and the Court of 
Industrial Relations. Section 3, Article VIII of the Constitution empowers the 
Congress to define, describe and apportion the jurisdiction of the various 
courts, with the only limitation that it can not deprive the Supreme Court of 
its appellate jurisdiction * * * therein specified". Such congressional 
authority must furthermore be acknowledged in connection with the express 
constitutional duty of the state "to regulate the relations between landowner 
and tenant and between labor and capital in industry and in agriculture". 
(Article XIII, sec. 6, Constitution.)</p>
<p align="justify">Our conclusion on the matter of jurisdiction necessarily 
requires a reversal of the order of mandamus which is premised on the duty of 
the justice of the peace to carry out its decision in an ejectment case after he 
<i>has acquired jurisdiction</i>. As we hold the justice of the peace had no 
jurisdiction over the subject-matter, it follows that his order to vacate (even 
supposing it had become final) could not be enforced either by himself or by 
others.</p>
<p align="justify">It also follows that injunction against the respondent 
Deogracias E. Lerma as representative of the Tenancy Division may not properly 
be issued, because he is acting or has acted within the scope of the authority 
of the Department of Justice.</p>
<p align="justify">Judgment reversed, without costs.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
