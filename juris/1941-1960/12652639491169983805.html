				<H3>FLAVIANO ROMERO, PETITIONER, VS. POTENCIANO PECSON, AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF SALA NO. VI OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, MACARIO OFILADA, AS SHERIFF OF THE CITY OF MANILA, AND DOLORES P. DE ESPEDIDO, AS PARTY-PLAINTIFF IN CIVIL CASE NO. 3280 FOR EJECTMENT IN THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a special civil action of certiorari instituted by the 
petitioner against Judge Pecson of the Court of First Instance of Manila, et 
al., on the ground that the respondent judge acted with grave abuse of 
discretion in ordering under section 2 of Rule 59, the execution of the judgment 
of the Court of First Instance in the civil case No. 3280, which sentenced the 
petitioner to pay Dolores P. de Espedido the monthly rental of P150 a month from 
February, 1947 to April, 1948, and to vacate the premises in an action of 
forcible entry and illegal detainer.
<p align="justify">According to Exhibit A of the petition or complaint, which is a 
copy of the judgment of the Court of First Instance in the civil case No. 3280 
of forcible entry and illegal detainer, the petitioner was sentenced by the 
Municipal Court of Manila to pay the monthly rental of P120 and to vacate the 
premises. He appealed from the decision, but as he did not file a supersedeas 
bond nor made a deposit with the Municipal Court of the rentals in arrears since 
the month from February, 1947, he was ordered to vacate, and the petitioner 
vacated, the leased premises on April 21, 1947, on a writ of execution. On 
appeal the respondent judge rendered a judgment sentencing the petitioner to pay 
to the respondent Dolores P. de Espedido a monthly rental of P150 from February, 
1947, to April 21, 1948, and to vacate the premises. The petitioner appealed 
from said decision.</p>
<p align="justify">The respondent Espedido moved for the execution of the judgment 
of the Court of First Instance and the latter granted the petition on the ground 
that the defendant appellant had failed to pay the monthly rental neither had he 
filed a supersedeas bond or deposited the rental in arrears with the Clerk of 
the Court, and that the appeal interposed by the petitioner is a dilatory tactic 
which constitutes a great drawback to the administration of justice.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner alleges that the order of execution was issued 
with grave abuse of discretion, because the petitioner had already perfected his 
appeal and the order of execution did not contain any special reason except that 
the petitioner had not filed a supersedeas bond in the inferior court and the 
appeal was a dilatory tactic, and there was no need for the filing of said 
supersedeas bond since the petitioner, who is a party defendant in said case, 
was no longer occupying the premises therein involved.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner's contention is untenable. The order of 
execution was issued under section 9, Rule 72, end not under section 2, Rule 39 
of the Rules of Court. Under the provision of said section 9, the decision of 
the Court of First Instance on appeal from a judgment of the inferior, court in 
an action of forcible entry and illegal detainer, shall not be stayed unless the 
appellant pays either to the plaintiff or into the appellate court the amounts 
referred to in section 8 of the same Rule. The petitioner having failed to pay, 
either to the plaintiff respondent Espedido, or to the Clerk of the Court of 
First Instance or appellate court, the rents for the months, from February to 
April 21, 1948, determined by the judgment of the respondent judge or to file a 
supersedeas bond to secure the payment of the rent in arrears determined by the 
municipal court, and for that reason the decision of the inferior court was 
executed, the judgment of the Court of First Instance shall not be stayed by the 
appeal therefrom taken by the petitioner. Therefore, the respondent judge acted, 
not with grave abuse of discretion, but in accordance with law in ordering the 
execution of the judgment, because the execution of the judgment is not only for 
the restoration of the possession of the premises leased but also for the 
payment of the rents due and payable as determined by said judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">The original provision of section 88 of Act No. 190 provided 
that appeal by the defendant from the judgment of the justice of the peace in 
forcible entry and illegal detainer to the Court of First Instance, shall not be 
allowed unless the defendant files an obligation with sufficient sureties to 
answer for the rents already accrued and to become due from time to time down to 
the time of the final judgment in the action, and that if no such obligation 
were filed the appaal would not become perfected and the judgment shall be 
executed. Said section was amended by Act No. 1778 so as to provide that the 
appeal shall not be allowed if the defendant appellant did not file an 
obligation with sufficient sureties to answer for the rents, damages, and costs, 
and after it had been allowed it shall be dismissed, upon motion of the 
plaintiff, should the appellant fail to pay during the pendency of the appeal to 
the plaintiff or into the court the amount of rents or damages which is the 
reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises due from time to time 
during the pendency of the appeal; and "the dismissal of the appeal shall revive 
the judgment of the justice of the peace, which judgment may be enforced by 
execution as though no appeal has been taken."</p>
<p align="justify">Subsequently Acts 2588 and 4115 amended said section 88 by 
providing that if, during the pendency of the appeal the defendant-appellant 
fails to pay the plaintiff or into court the amount of rents or damages due from 
time to time, the court shall not dismiss the appeal and this may proceed, but 
order the execution of the judgment of the inferior court <i>relative to the 
possession of the property</i> in litigation; and that "in any case wherein it 
appears that the defendant has been deprived of the lawful possession of land 
and a building pending the appeal by virtue of the execution of the judgment of 
the justice of the peace, damages for such deprivation of possession may be 
allowed the defendant in the judgment of the Court of First Instance disposing 
of the appeal."</p>
<p align="justify">The above quoted provisions of section 88 of Act No. 190, as 
amended by Acts Nos. 2558 and 4115, were incorporated in section 8 of Rule 78 of 
the Rules of Court, with the amendment, which the Supreme Court has the power to 
make, for it is a matter of procedure, that should the defendant appellant fail 
to make the payments of rents or reasonable value for the use and occupation of 
the premises from time to time, the court shall order the execution of the 
judgment appealed, without any limitation or qualification, that is, not only 
relative to the possession of the property in litigation but also the rents or 
damages due from the defendant to the plaintiff if there is any adjudged in the 
judgment, as if no appeal has been taken. Because under the provisions of said 
section 8, the stay of the immediate execution of the judgment of the inferior 
court is conditioned, not only upon the filing of a supersedeas bond, but upon 
the periodical payment to the plaintiff, or into the court of the rents or 
damages due from time to time; while under section 88 of Act 190, as amended by 
Act 2588 aid incorporated in Act No. 4115, the execution of the judgment after 
its rendition is stayed by the filing of a supersedeas bond; and during the 
pendency of the appeal, the stay of the execution of the judgment <i>relative to 
the possession of the property</i> in litigation is conditioned upon the payment 
to the plaintiff or into the court of the rents or damages due from time to 
time, and if no such payment is made the judgment relative to possession shall 
be executed. The provision of section 8 of Rule 72 adopts substantially those of 
section 88 of Act No. 190, as amended by section 1778, except that, instead of 
providing for the dismissal of the appeal and execution of the judgment as if no 
appeal has been taken according to Act 1778, it provides for the execution of 
the judgment and not for the dismissal of the appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">The provision of section 9 of Rule 72 which requires, as the 
only condition for staying the execution of the judgment of the Court of First 
Instance, that the defendant appellant shall pay, during the pendency of the 
appeal, to the plaintiff or into the court the rents or the reasonable value of 
the use and occupation of the premises as found by the Court of First Instance, 
is predicated on the assumption that a supersedeas bond or obligation to answer 
for the rents and damages determined by the inferior court has been filed and 
the required payments of rents or damages due from time to time has been made 
during the pendency of the appeal, as it is generally the case. But if no 
supersedeas bond had been filed with the inferior court or the rents or damages 
determined by the inferior court until the judgment of the Court of First 
Instance had not been paid, the defendant appellant must file a supersedeas bond 
to secure the payment of all the back rents or damages determined by the Court 
of First Instance, and also make the payments above referred to in said section 
9 in order to stay the execution of the judgment of the Court of First Instance. 
Otherwise, the defendant, by appealing, may continue in possession of the 
premises without paying or giving any guarantee or security for the payment of 
the rents or damages due and unpaid up to the rendition of the final judgment of 
the appellate court, contrary to the rationale of the law relative to execution 
of the judgment in forcible entry and illegal detainer.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, the petition of certiorari is dismissed. So 
ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">Paras, <i>J., </i>I concur in the result. Failure to file a supersedeas bond or 
to make a deposit in lieu thereof, made or rendered the original decision 
executory.</p></div>
