				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Certiorari  against an order of  dismissal issued by  the Court of First Instance of Manila, and prohibition against the Municipal Court of Manila, Hon.  Ambrosio  M. Geraldez,  presiding, to enjoin it from taking cognizance  of an information filed before it for estafa against the petitioner (Criminal  Case No.  D-057576). <br><br>On March  14,  1955, Assistant Fiscal Gregorio  F.  Lim of Manila filed an information for  estafa  (Criminal Case No.   30750)   against  petitioner  Sotera Dimagiba.  The information charges that  the accused  therein, petitioner in these  proceedings,  defrauded,  misappropriated,  misapplied and converted,  the  sum  of P200.00,  which should have  been  delivered to  complainant.  On November  5, 1955, after the information  had been read and the  accused entered a plea of not  guilty  thereto, the court dismissed the  information  for  want  of  jurisdiction.   Thereafter, on January 17,  1956, Fiscal  Lim  presented   another information  against   the  accused,  this  time   before the Municipal Court of Manila.   The information is a replica of the information  filed  previously in the Court  of First Instance.   Upon the filing of this information the accused, petitioner herein, filed a motion  to quash, alleging double jeopardy.   The motion was denied and upon his failure to obtain a reconsideration  of the  denial of the motion  to quash,  the  accused  instituted the present action  in this Court. <br><br>The petitioner  claim that the Court  of First Instance of Manila had jurisdiction  to try the offense charged  in the information  filed with it  under the authority  of the Revised Charter of the City  of  Manila (R. A. No.  409), particularly Section  41, which provides as follows: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 41. <span style="font-style: italic;">Criminal jurisdiction.</span>-The municipal court  shall  have territorial  jurisdiction  embracing  the entire  police jurisdiction  of the city, and shall hold a  daily session, Sundays and legal holidays alone executed:  <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however,</span> That when  a legal  holiday occurs in two or  more  successive clays or when a Sunday is immediately preceded and/or followed  by  a holiday,  the  municipal court may hold  night session  during said  holidays.  Said  court shall  have jurisdiction exclusive of the other courts sitting in  the  city over all criminal cases arising  under the penal laws  of the Philippines, where the  offense is  committed within  the  police jurisdiction of the city and  the maximum punishment is by imprisonment for not more  than  six  months, or a fine of not more than  two hundred pesos,  or both. <br><br>"It  shall also have concurrent jurisdiction with the Courts of First  Instance over all criminal cases arising under the laws relating to gambling  and  management of lotteries,  to  assaults where the intent to kill is not charged or evident upon the trial, to larceny, embezzlement and estafa where the  amount of money or  property stolen, embezzled  or  otherwise  involved  dees  not  exceed  the  sum or value  of two hundred pesos, to the sale of  intoxicating liquors, to falsely impersonating an officer, to malicious mischief, to trespass on  Government or private  property, and to threatening to take human life.  It may  also  conduct  preliminary examinations for any offense, without regard to the limits of  punishment, and may release, or  commit and bind  ever any  person  charged with such offense to secure appearance before the proper court.' </blockquote>The  cases of People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Palmon,  86 Phil., 350,  47 Off. Gaz.  29, and  People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Colicio,  88 Phil. 196 are cited in support  of  this contention. <br><br>The information  filed  in the Court of First  Instance of Manila charges misappropriation of the sum  of P200.00. The penalty prescribed for this offense is <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto  mayor</span> in  its medium  and maximum period  (Art. 315,  par. 5, Revised  Penal  Code).   The  offense charged,  therefore, falls  within the exclusive jurisdiction  of the Municipal Court of  Manila in  accordance with  Section 41  of its revised charter.   But it  is  argued  that the  second  paragraph of  the same section,  which provides: <br><blockquote>"It  shall  also have  concurrent  jurisdiction  with the Courts of First  Instance over all criminal cases arising  under  the  laws relating to  gambling and management  of lotteries ,to assaults where the intent to kill is not charged or  evident upon the trial, to larceny, embezzlement and estafa where the amount of money or  property stolen, embezzled  or otherwise involved  does  not  exceed  the  sum or value of two hundred pesos, to the sale of intoxicating liquors, to falsely impersonating an officer, to malicious mischief, to trespass on Government or private  property, and to  threatening  to take human life. * * *" </blockquote>is a grant of concurrent jurisdiction to try  the same case to the Court of First Intance. There are various reasons for rejecting this   contention.  Section  41 is  found  in "Article  IX-The  Municipal Court" of the  Charter  of Manila,  and  defines the  jurisdiction of  the Municipal Court of the City,  both original and concurrent.  No implication may be made therefrom of a grant of concurrent jurisdiction to the  Court of First  Instance.   Grants  of jurisdiction cannot  be merely implied.  Then the provision from which the grant is sought.to be implied  defines the jurisdiction  of  the  Municipal  Court only, and cannot possibly  refer to another court,  whose jurisdiction is  defined in  another  law (Republic Act No. 296).  That the Municipal Court should have concurrent  jurisdiction over certain specific crimes triable by a  Court  of First Instance is no bases for the  claim that the Court of First Instance, conversely,  has also concurrent  jurisdiction   over  cases triable  by  the  Municipal  Court.   Lastly,  the Court  of First Instance is a court of general jurisdiction and it is unreasonable  to assume that the Legislature  intended  to grant to  it  concurrent jurisdiction over  minor offenses such as <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa </span>involving such amounts as may be less than P200.00. <br><br>We have also examined the cases that have been cited  by both of the parties to the proceedings and found out that none of them covers the precise question raised and decided in these  proceedings. <br><br>The   petition is  hereby  denied,  with  costs  against petitioner. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.  L.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br></div>
