				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 15, 1947, Cesareo R. Colasito, candidate for mayor of Tolosa, 
Leyte, filed with the Court of First Instance of Leyte, a petition, in pursuance 
of Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code, for the recounting of the 
votes cast in Precinct No. 8 of Tolosa, in view of contradictory official 
statements issued by the Board Election Inspectors as to the votes cast for the 
candidates for mayor, the conflict affecting the result of the Elections.
<p>Colasito alleged: </p>
<p>That on or about November 12, 1947, and immediately After making a statement 
of the counting of the result of the elections, the board of election inspectors 
issued a certificate showing the number of votes polled by the candidates for 
mayor as follows:</p>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td>
<div align="right">92</div></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>That, counting the above votes with those of the nine other precincts of 
Tolosa, he would win by majority of 38 votes as follows:</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<td>
<div align="right">992</div></td>
<td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>That, instead of filing the statement made immediately Aftfter the counting, 
the board of election inspectors submitted another; return which would give Luis 
C. Trinchera the majority, by crediting him 50 votes more than actually cast in 
his favor and subtracting 50 from those polled by petitioner Colasito as 
follows:</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

<p>Accordingly, the lower court issued on November 26 an order for the 
recounting of the votes cast in precinct No. 8 of Tolosa, the recounting to be 
made by the board of election inspectors under the supervision of the clerk of 
court, the board to certify in writing the result of the recounting, and the 
certification to be submitted by the municipal treasurer to the municipal 
council as municipal board of canvassers.</p>
<p>The board of election inspectors of precinct No. 8 of Tolosa, joined by Francisco Arguta, municipal treasurer of Tolosa as members of the municipal 
board of canvassers, and Luis C. Trinchera, filed a petition for a writ of 
prohibition asking this Court to prohibit respondent judge from enforcing its 
order for the recounting of the votes cast in precinct No. 8 of Tolosa.</p>
<p>The sole ground of the petition, as amply explained in the objection to the 
opening of the ballot boxes filed by petitioners with the lower court on 
November 26, 1947, Appendix B of the petition, is that the certificate issued by 
the poll inspectors after the counting on November 12, attesting to the fact 
that Colasito obtained 112 votes and Trinchera 92, is not one of the statements 
contemplated by Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Code.</p>
<p>Neither in their objection of November 26, 1947, nor in the petition before 
us, have petitioners attempted to challenge the serious charge of falsification 
of the election returns filed with the municipal treasurer They do not dispute 
the authenticity of the certificate. They do not dispute the contradiction 
between the authentic certification and the allegedly falsified election 
returns. They do not dispute the fact that, under the authentic certificate, 
Cesareo R. Colastico appears to be the mayor elected by the people. They do not 
dispute that through the election returns challenged in the lower court as 
false, the choice of the people appears to be supplanted by Luis G. Trinchera, 
the one repudiated by the people.</p>
<p>To stop the recounting of votes that would reveal and frustrate a supposed 
election fraud, petitioners would only resort to a legal technicality premised 
on a clumsy misinterpretation of the meaning of words.</p>
<p>The certificate in question is one of the official statements required by law 
to be issued by the poll inspectors immediately after counting, and it is so 
specifically provided by Section 155 of the Revised Election Code. The next 
section, 154, provides that after the announcement of the result of the 
elections in the polling place, the board of inspectors is not to make any 
alteration or amendment "in any of its statements" unless it be so ordered by a 
competent court. It is significant that the words "in any of its statements" are 
used in the section immediately following the section providing for the issuance 
of certificate of the number ©f votes polled by the candidates.</p>
<p>No amount of logodaedaly may conceal the fact that a certificate is a 
statement issued for some specific purpose may be following a form or issued 
with some solemnity, but comprehended within the meaning of the ward 
statement.</p>
<p>A certificate is a "certified statement" or "a written declaration legally 
authenticated." It is a certification which is but a "certified statement." 
(Webster's New International Dictionary). The word came from the Latin word 
<em>certificatus</em>, past participle of <em>certificare</em>, and moans "made 
certain."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Statement" is act of stating, reciting, or presenting verbally or on paper. 
Harrison <em>vs.</em> State 147 N. E., 650, 654. (40 Words and Phrases, Perm. 
ed. p. 37.)</p>
<p>Statement. Webster defines the word as the act of stating, reciting, or 
presenting, verbally or on paper. See Montague <em>vs.</em> Thomason, 91 Tenn. 
158, 173. (Ballentine, Law Dictionary p. 1229.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By statute, the certificate of various officers may be made evidence, in 
which case the effect cannot be extended by including facts other than those 
authorized, * * * (1 Bouvier's Law Dictionary, p. 442.)</p>
<p>A certificate is a declaration in writing. Ticonic Bank <em>vs.</em> 
Stackpole, 41 Me. 302, 305.</p>
<p>The term "certificate" imports the statement of some fact in writing signed 
by the party certifying. Nowell <em>vs.</em> Mayor and Council of Monroe, 171 S. 
E., 136, 141.)</p>
<p>A "certificate" is "a writing giving assurance that a thing has or has not 
been done; * * * that a fact exists or does not exist." Cook <em>vs</em>. Ziff 
Colored Masonic Lodge No. 119, 96 S. W., 618, 620.</p>
<p>The "written statement" mentioned in Township Organization Act, article 7 
sec. 7, Smith-Hurd Stats, c. 139 section 66, requiring the Judges of an election 
to make a written statement or certificate of the number of votes cast, is 
equivalent in meaning to the word "certificate" as used in the act. The term 
does not include a written statement not signed by the judges of election. 
(People <em>vs.</em> Nordheim, 99 Ill. 553, 560. 6 Words and Phrases, Perm. ed. 
p. 427.)"</p></blockquote>
<p>That the contradictory statements or copies thereof mentioned in Sections 163 
and 168 of the Revised Election Code the certificate in question can rightly be 
seen from the fact that according to section 152, only one copy of the election 
returns of each precinct is filed with the municipal treasurer. No one should 
believe that the lawmakers had contemplated difference of votes in other 
authentic copies "of statements" or "copies of the same statements," when the 
municipal treasurer cannot submit to the municipal board of canvassers more than 
one copy of the election returns. Undoubtedly, the other copies referred to are 
the certificates in question, as they arc in fact copies of what the poll 
inspectors have written in the return prepared and signed immediately after the 
counting, in the presence of all watchers and the public, before whom the 
results are announced <em>viva voce</em>, while everybody may check if the 
announcement tallies or not with the figures written on the blackboard.</p>
<p>Even on the wrong hypothesis that there should be a doubt as to whether the 
statements mentioned in Sections 163 and 168 of the Revised Election Cede may 
also include the certificates mentioned by Section 153, the doubt should be 
resolved in favor of the unmistakable intention of the lawmakers that any 
conflict between the several statements and certificates issued by the same 
board of election inspectors as to the result of the election regarding 
municipal and provincial positions should be right away threshed out by the 
summary procedure of the judicial recounting of the votes, which will take a 
small fraction of the day. The purpose of the law is to offer a prompt relief to 
a simple controversy that can immediately be settled through a summary judicial 
proceeding that may dispense with the long drawn and complicated proceedings of 
a full-dressed electoral contest and, at the same time, by the use of a simple 
and effective expedient, to restore public tranquillity by dispelling all doubts 
as to the true number of votes cast in a given precinct. Legal technicalities 
should be used to help in arriving at a clear intention of the law and not to 
defeat said intention.<br><br>Upon the facts alleged by Colasito in the lower 
court, it can bo gathered that on November 12, 1947, Immediately upon tho 
counting, the board of election inspectors issued a certificate of the number of 
votes polled by tho candidates for mayor, and the numbers appearing in the 
certificate tallied with the numbers written on the blackboard and with the 
written statements in quadruplicate required by Section 150 of the Revised 
Election Code, The presumption is that the certificate issued <em>res 
gestae</em> cantained the truth. Being in conflict with the election returns 
filed with the municipal treasurer, the one filed must be presumed to have been 
prepared in substitution of the genuine one, originally signed at the polling 
place immediately after the counting, which must have been withheld, concealed, 
or destroyed. Under the circumstances, the certificate has taken the place, of 
said original;election returns and, like the latter, cannot fail to be described 
also as a statement. Therefore, from the narrow and mistaken point of view of 
petitioners, the contradiction between the authentic statement, the <em>res 
gestae</em> certificate and the one filed with the municipal treasurer and 
challeged by respondent Colasito as falsified, is an undisputable for the 
recounting of votes for determine the true vote polled by each candidate and 
exhibiting the best evidence as to the truth of facts and as to whether fraud 
falsification have been committed or not.</p>
<p>Under Section 157 of the Revised Election Code, the ballot boxes are Fubject 
to any official investigation which may be ordered by a competent court or other 
authority. In the present ougc there is an indication that a criminal 
falsification might have been committed to defeat the will of the people and 
which is ground for starting criminal proceedings. Public interest demands 
Immediate recounting of the votes in question and no delay should bo 
entertained. It is absolutely necessary that, before it is too late, the choice 
of the people be not supplanted by an impostor and that the ones criminally 
responsible for the fraudulent falsification be not allowed to get away with 
their crime. Those tampering with elections are among the worst offenders. They 
are number one enemies of democracy.</p>

<p><strong>PARAS, J.:</strong></p>I concur in the foregoing opinion of Mr. 
Justice Perfecto. It may be added that sections163 and 138 are new provisions of 
the Election Code which were inserted after the promulgation by this Court of 
the decision in the case of Benitez<em> vs</em>. Paredes and Dizon,. 52 Phil., 
18, wherein Chief Justice Avanceña stated: "The. purpose of the law in requiring 
that this certificate be issued to the watchers is precisely to give the latter 
a means of seeing to it that the returns are not tampered with. Considering that 
the certificates of votes issued, are presumed to be no longer in possession of 
the board of inspector, it follows that the law cannot refer to them, but rather 
to the statement which after all, is also certificate of the result of the 
canvass." This explains the insertion in sections 163 and 168 of the Election 
Code of the provisions quoted by Mr. Justice Tuason in his dissenting 
opinion.<br><br><br>
<hr shade="" no="" align="center" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>TUASON, J.:</strong>:</p>
<p>Section 163 of the Revised Election Code reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>When statements of a preinct are contradictory.</em>—In case it appears 
to the provincial board of canvassers that another copy or other authentic 
copies of the statement from an election precinct submitted to the board give to 
a candidate a different number of votes and the difference affects the result of 
the election, the Court of First Instance of the province, upon motion of the 
board or of any candidate affected, may proceed to recount the votes cast in the 
precinct for the sole purpose of determining which is the true statement or 
which is the true result of the count of the votes cast in said precinct for the 
office in question. Notice of such proceeding shall be given to all candidates 
affected."</p></blockquote>
<p>With reference to the canvass for municipal offices Section 168 provides that 
"In case of contradictions or discrepancies between the copies of the same 
statements, the procedure provided in section one hundred and sixty-three of 
this Code shall be followed." </p>
<p>The foregoing provisions make discrepancies among the fout copies of the 
statement the sole ground for a recounting of the votes cast in a precinct. All 
s uch copies in the present case tally with one another. The discrepancy is 
between these copies on the one hand and *a certificate of the number of the 
votes received by a candidate" for mayor on the other.</p>
<p>The decision says "No amount of logodaedaly may conceal the fact that a 
certificate is a statement issued for some specific purpose may be following a 
form or issued with some solemnity, but comprehended within the meaning of the 
word statement." Those who hold the opposite view plead not guilty to indulging 
in logodaedaly. They rest their case on an indubitable precept of the law. It 
does not take much acumen to see that, whatever literal similarity there may be 
bet- ween the words "statement" and "certificate", the Election Code has 
employed them in different senses and for different purposes. A superficial 
analysis of sections 150-169 can not fail to confirm this conclusion. Nowhere is 
there reasonable indication they are intended to convey the same 
meaning.<br><br>Statement is synonymous with return. (Galang <em>vs.</em> 
Miranda and De Leon, 36 Phil. 316.) In the sense in which it is used in the 
Election Code, a statement is a report which "shows the date of the election, 
the name of the municipality and the number of the election precinct in which it 
was held, the total number of yellow and white ballots found in the box for 
valid ballots, the total number of yellow and white ballots withdrawn from the 
box for spoiled ballots because they were erroneously placed therein, the total 
number of yellow and white excess ballots, the total number of yellow and white 
rejected ballots and the total number of votes polled by each candidate." 
(Section 150.) A certificate, according to the same law, section 153, is a 
document which the board of inspectors issues to the watchers giving "the number 
of votes received by a candidate, or by the opposing candidates."</p>
<p>This Court has already had an occasion to say, in Benitez <em>vs.</em> 
Paredes and Dizon, 52 Phil., 1, that although, "in a broad sense, the returns 
are also certificates of votes in regard to the result of the election," "the 
returns and the certificate are two entirely different things." It explains that 
"the returns are the documents to be sent to the authorities indicated in the 
law, and the certificate of votes is the document that is delivered to the 
watchers who may request it."</p>
<p>It is trite to emphasize that legislative intention is the law; that in 
expounding one part of a statute resort should be had to every other part, and 
that where the meaning of one word in one instance is clear, this meaning will 
be attached to it elsewhere, (59 C. J. 1003.)</p>
<p>It is clear beyond cavil from what has been said in the preceding paragraphs, 
that the only consideration which authorizes the court of first instance to 
recount the votes is discrepancy or contradiction among the statements or 
returns. Discrepancy or contradiction between statements or returns on the one 
hand and certificates on the other are not ground for a recounting.</p>
<p>And reason is not lacking for the distinction thus made. Certificates after 
they have been handed to watchers are beyond the control of responsible 
officials. They are more susceptible of falsification, and a recounting of the 
ballots under sections 163 and 168 on the strength of a certificate would be 
likely to entail delay in the proclamation of the result of the election which, 
in the interest of the public, as the majority say, should be released at the 
earliest possible date. Prudence demands that recounting be limited to instances 
where the discrepancies are found in authentic copies kept or received by 
responsible officials who are presumed to be disinterested and to act in good 
faith. As a matter of necessity, the ground for recounting the votes has to be 
confined to contradictions between copies of the document which, to the 
exclusion of all others, the board of inspectors is bound to look to in the 
computation of the votes polled by each candidate. With so many watchers—one for 
each candidate, except candidates for municipal councilors who are entitled to 
only one watcher for each party (section 93)—it is extremely unwise, not to say 
dangerous, to allow an error, intentional or honest, in a certificate of votes 
to serve as foundation for recounting of the ballots. A candidate not satisfied 
with the count of votes could secure a recount by falsifying one of the 
certificates. Forgery of a certificate can be made so perfect as to defy 
detection except with the aid of scientific investigation. If investigation be 
made, that would take time, I make this observation not as a factor for 
disregarding the law but as a help to fix its meanings "We test the rule by its 
results."<br><br>The fact that the prohibition, covered by section 154, against 
making any alteration or amendment win any of its statement" immediately follows 
the provision for the issuance of certificates embodied in section 153, does not 
connote that statement and certificate are synonymous or that the prohibition 
relates to certificates as well as statements. We may presume that for the sake 
of clearness and symmetry, the matter of issuing certificates to watchers 
(section 153) was given precedence in the order of arrangements over the 
prohibition against making alterations or amendments (section 154), because the 
issuance of certificates is contemporaneous with the distribution of the returns 
provided for in section 152 and is closer to the latter in its nature than to 
amendments. It should be noted in this connection that the sections of the 
Election Code axe arranged according to the order in which the successive stages 
and steps of an election are accomplished.</p>
<p>At any rate, it seems to me an incongruity to say that the prohibition of 
section 154 against alterations or amendments refers to certificates issued to 
watchers when the election inspectors, once they have parted with such 
certificates, lose control over them. It is difficult to understand that in 
prohibiting the amendment or alteration of statements section 154 could 
contemplate papers or documents which are beyond the reach of the board of 
election inspectors, the board of canvassers, of the competent court. Can it be 
conceived that any watoher or candidate would surrender a certificate for the 
purpose of amendment if the change; be unfavorable to its holder? And what could 
be the practical good of amending a certificate when it is the returns which the 
board of canvassers has to use as guide in the proclamation of the results of an 
election?<br><br>It is also said that "no one should believe that the law makers 
had contemplated differences of votes in authentic copies or statements or 
copies of the same statements when the municipal treasurer cannot submit to the 
municipal board of canvassers more than one copy of the eleotlon return." This 
argument applies with greater force against the contention that the copies 
mentioned in section 154 comprehend certificates of votes. In the first place, 
while the municipal board of canvassers has one copy of the statement, it does 
not receive a single certificate or copy of a certificate from the municipal 
treasurer or from any other election official. In the second place, a 
certificate is not by any means a copy. In a general sense it is an original—a 
written testimony to the truth that certain candidates obtained the numbers of 
votes certified therein. A certificate contains only a brief extract of one of 
the numerous items specified in the statement.<br><br>The important thing, 
however, is the intention of the legislature. Even though only one copy of the 
statement finds its way into the hands of the municipal or provincial board of 
canvassers, it is plain from the wording of section 153 that it has in view 
discrepancies between the statement submitted to the board from an election 
precinct and the copy or copies thereof submitted to other officials of the 
government. Although the four copies of the statement are distributed among four 
different officials or entities, differences between them do have a sure way of 
showing up, what with the candidates, their followers and the officials 
connected with the holding of the election showing keen interest in the result, 
checking up documents in their possession with those in the hands of others and 
making their own computations. Discrepancies between such copies had cropped up 
time and time again giving rise to controversies, litigations and difficulties 
over the method for adjusting the conflicts. It was in the light of these 
controversies that sections 163 and 168 were, in my opinion, enacted.</p>
<p>Courts cannot transcend the powers granted to them by law, nor will their 
jurisdiction be enlarged by intendment. (5 C.J., 810.) So where a court of 
general jurisdiction exercises in a special statutory manner, or otherwise than 
according to the course of the common law, specific statutory powers not 
'belonging to it as such court, and not within its ordinary jurisdiction, it 
(the court), under such circumstances, stands, with respect to the special power 
exercised, on the same footing with courts of limited and inferior jurisdiction. 
(21 C. J., 152.) Jurisdiction in such cases must affirmatively appear. (Ibid., 
153.)<br><br>This is specially true where, as here, the power to recount the 
votes "is an administrative and supervisory power Intended to secure correctness 
in the amendment of the returns." (G. R. No. 35800; Board of Election Inspectors 
of Boñgalon <em>vs.</em> Sison, 55 Phil., 915-917.) This function formerly 
devolved upon the board of canvassers, but has been transferred to the courts 
with a view, presumably, to secure regularity and fairness in the recount. The 
function has not become judicial by the fact that the courts exercise it. Its 
administrative and ministerial character ia retained. The court's duty remains 
purely mechanical or mathematical, as shown by the fact that the court is not 
called upon to render any judgment, decision or ruling. The court has no greater 
claim to an enlargement of its authority than the board of election inspectors 
or the board of canvassers if these performed that authority.</p>
<p>Of course the certificate of votes has a purpose. Its purpose is not to make 
a certificate the basis for a recount of ballots when the statements conflict 
with it; it is simply and solely to deter election officials of dishonest 
intentions from tampering with the outcome of the voting, or if such tampering 
should in fact be committed, to provide the candidates adversely affected with 
evidence in the ensuing protest. And yet it is not even a primary evidence; it 
is only entitled to weight. Its utility is thus stated by this Court: "While 
this document is not primary evidence in the strict sense, it was nevertheless 
made in obedience to the precepts of the law and was so nearly contemporaneous 
with the making of the return that it is entitled to weight," (Dizon 
<i>vs.<i> Provincial Board of Canvassers of Laguna, 52 Phil., 47, 
54.)</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>The objection then of the petitioners is not a mere "legal technicality, 
premised on a clumsy misinterpretation of the meaning of the words". The 
question goes deeper than that.<br><br>The Election Law has laid down rules with 
minute care, alloting functions to each official and specifying when and how 
they should be performed. These rules are calculated to assure an orderly 
process in the conduct of an election and to safeguard both the interests of the 
candidates and of the public. In consonance with this policy, the law has 
adopted an elaborate procedure for the threshing out of election controversies, 
outlining what pleadings should allege, the time within which they should be 
filed, how the trial is to be conducted, etc., etc. This contest is a judicial 
proceeding. The recounting of votes, which is summary, administrative and 
ministerial in character, has not been devised to take the place of a 
full-dressed contest". Numerous factors enter into an election controversy which 
cannot be attended to in an interlocutory proceeding. To pay slight regard to 
this manifest limitation, to give the law greater effect than its terms require, 
to show disdain for law and precedents, in the name of convenience, efficiency 
and justice, is unjustified judicial legislation, a spurious interpretation 
carried to a harmful extreme. Justice is many-sided, and truth is not always 
what we believe. The courts are not endowed with the power of clairvoyance to 
divine from scanty allegations in pleadings where justice and truth lie. Quite 
apart from the fundamental principle of the separation of powers Involved, the 
prevailing decision will pave the way for an avalanche of petitions for 
recounting of the ballots, and result in prolonging the conditions which the 
court would put an end to quickly by enlarging the precepts of sections 163 and 
l68. If a recounting of the ballots in one precinct might, in some cases, decide 
an election, it does not do so in the majority of cases and so would not, except 
rarely, eliminate a "full-dressed contest." What is more, there may be In 
connection with the recounting of ballots matters which cannot be properly 
alleged and decided except in a regular contest, such as the validity of 
ballots, the legality of the conduct of the election, etc., matters regarding 
which the parties must be given the right and the opportunity to be heard in the 
interest of truth and Justice and, in the last analysis, of efficiency or 
convenience itself. To paraphrase an author, the election procedure is the 
expression of a principle of order to which candidates and the courts must 
conform if friction and waste and delays are to be avoided. Let a judge proceed 
in each case according to his personal idea of the people's interest and public 
convenience, and there will be chaos in the place of order, doubts in place of 
certainty and stability of law. The loss in the long run will be .greater than 
the immediate gain.<br>
