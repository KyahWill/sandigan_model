				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision of the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals. Celestino Co &amp; Company is a&nbsp; duly registered general copartnership&nbsp; doing&nbsp; business&nbsp; under the&nbsp; trade&nbsp; name of Oriental Sash&nbsp; Factory".&nbsp; From'&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1951&nbsp; it paid percentage taxes of&nbsp; 7 per&nbsp; cent on the&nbsp; gross receipts&nbsp; of its sash,&nbsp; door and&nbsp; window factory,&nbsp; in accordance with section one hundred eighty-six&nbsp; of the&nbsp; National Revenue Code imposing taxes on&nbsp; sales of&nbsp; manufactured&nbsp; articles. However&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1952 it&nbsp; began to claim liability&nbsp; only to the contractor's 3&nbsp; per cent tax&nbsp; (instead of 7 per cent)&nbsp; under section 191 of the same Code; and having&nbsp; failed to&nbsp; convince&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau of&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue,&nbsp; it&nbsp; brought the matter to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Tax Appeals, where it also failed. Said the&nbsp; Court:<blockquote>&nbsp;"To support his&nbsp; contention that his&nbsp; client&nbsp; is an&nbsp; ordinary contractor * * * counsel presented * * *&nbsp; duplicate&nbsp; copies of&nbsp; letters, sketches of doors and windows and price quotations supposedly sent by&nbsp; the manager.of&nbsp; the Oriental&nbsp; Sash&nbsp; Factory&nbsp; to four customers who allegedly made special orders for doors and windows&nbsp; from the said factory.&nbsp; The&nbsp; conclusion that counsel&nbsp; would like&nbsp; us&nbsp; to deduce from these few&nbsp; exhibits is that the Oriental Sash Factory does not&nbsp; manufacture&nbsp; ready made&nbsp; doors, sash&nbsp; and windows&nbsp; for the public but&nbsp; only upon special order of&nbsp; its&nbsp; select customers. * * * I&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; believe' that petitioner company&nbsp; would&nbsp; take,&nbsp; as in fact&nbsp; it has taken, all the trouble and expense&nbsp; of registering a special&nbsp; trade name&nbsp; for its sash business&nbsp; and&nbsp; then orders&nbsp; company stationery carrying the&nbsp; bold print '<em>Oriental&nbsp; Sash Factory</em> (Celestino&nbsp; Co &amp; Company,&nbsp; Prop.)&nbsp; 926 Raon&nbsp; St.&nbsp; Quiapo,&nbsp; Manila, Tel. No.&nbsp; 33076, <em>Manufacturers of all kinds of&nbsp; doors,&nbsp; windows, sashes, furnitures,&nbsp; etc. used season-dried and kiln-dried lumber, of the best quality workmanship'</em> solely for the&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; supplying the needs for doors, windows and sash of its special&nbsp; and limited customers.&nbsp; One will note that&nbsp; petitioner has chosen for&nbsp; its trade name and&nbsp; has&nbsp; offered&nbsp; itself to the public as a&nbsp; 'Factory', which means it is out to do business, in its&nbsp; chosen&nbsp; lines on&nbsp; a&nbsp; bigscale. As a general rule, sash factories receive orders&nbsp; for doors&nbsp; and windows of special&nbsp; design only in particular cases but the bulk of&nbsp; their&nbsp; sales&nbsp; is&nbsp; derived from&nbsp; ready made&nbsp; doors&nbsp; and&nbsp; windows of standard sizes for the average home.&nbsp; Moreover, as&nbsp; shown from the&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; of petitioner's books of accounts,&nbsp; during&nbsp; the period from January 1, 1952 to&nbsp; September 30,&nbsp; 1952, it sold sash, doors and&nbsp; windows worth W88,754.69.&nbsp;&nbsp; I find&nbsp; it difficult&nbsp; to believe that this amount which runs to&nbsp; six figures was derived by petitioner entirely from&nbsp; its&nbsp;&nbsp; few&nbsp; customers who made&nbsp; special orders&nbsp; for these items.&nbsp; <p>"Even if. we were to believe petitioner's claim that it does&nbsp; not manufacture&nbsp; ready-made&nbsp; sash, doors, and windows for the public and&nbsp; that it&nbsp; makes&nbsp; these&nbsp; articles only upon special order of its customers, that&nbsp; does not&nbsp; make it a contractor&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; purview of section&nbsp; 191 of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; There&nbsp; are: no less than fifty occupations enumerated in the aforesaid section' of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code&nbsp; subject to percentage&nbsp; tax and&nbsp; after reading&nbsp; carefully&nbsp; each&nbsp; and&nbsp; every&nbsp; one of&nbsp; them, we cannot find one under&nbsp; which the business enterprise&nbsp; of petitioner could&nbsp; appropriately&nbsp; fall.&nbsp; It would&nbsp; require a&nbsp; stretch of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law and much effort to make the business of&nbsp; manufacturing sash, doors: and&nbsp; windows&nbsp; upon special&nbsp; order&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; customers&nbsp; fall&nbsp; under&nbsp; the category of road,&nbsp; building, navigation, artesian&nbsp; well,&nbsp; water works and&nbsp; other construction&nbsp; work&nbsp; contractors;&nbsp; filling contractors'&nbsp; as enumerated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the section&nbsp; being&nbsp; invoked by&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; counsel. Construction&nbsp; work&nbsp; contractors&nbsp; are&nbsp; those&nbsp; who&nbsp; alter&nbsp; or&nbsp; repair buildings, structures,&nbsp; streets, highways, sewers,&nbsp; street railways, railroads,&nbsp; logging&nbsp; roads, electric, steam&nbsp; or&nbsp; water&nbsp; plants telegraph. and telephone plants and lines, electric&nbsp; lines&nbsp; or power lines,&nbsp; and includes any other work for&nbsp; the construction altering or repairing for which machinery driven by mechanical power is used.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Payton. <em>vs.</em> City of Anadardo 64 P. 2d 878, 880,&nbsp; 17&amp; Okl. 68).</p><p>"Having thus&nbsp; eliminated the feasibility of taxing&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; as a contractor under section 191 of&nbsp; the National Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code,&nbsp; this leaves us to decide the remaining issue whether or not petitioner could be&nbsp; taxed&nbsp; with lesser strain and more accuracy&nbsp; as seller&nbsp; of its manufactured articles&nbsp; trader section 186&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same code, as the respondent Collector of&nbsp; Internal Revenue has in&nbsp; fact been doing since the Oriental Sash Factory was established in 1946. "The percentage tax imposed in section 191&nbsp; of our&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Code&nbsp; is generally a tax on the sales of services, in contradiction with the tax&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 186 of the same Code which is&nbsp; a tax on the original sales of articles by the manufacturer, producer or importer. (Formilleza's Commentaries&nbsp; and&nbsp; Jurisprudence on&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code, Vol II, p. 744).&nbsp; The fact that the articles sold are manufactured&nbsp; by the seller does not exchange the contract from the purview&nbsp; of section 186 of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code as&nbsp; a sale&nbsp; of articles."</p></blockquote><p>There was a strong dissent;&nbsp; but upon&nbsp; careful consideration of the whole matter we&nbsp; are&nbsp; inclined&nbsp; to&nbsp; accept&nbsp; the above&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the facts&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; important thing to&nbsp; remember is that Celestino Go, &amp; Company habitually makes sash, windows and doors, as it has represented&nbsp; in its&nbsp; stationery&nbsp; and&nbsp; advertisements to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; it&nbsp; "manufactures" the "same&nbsp; is&nbsp; practically admitted by appellant itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that windows and doors&nbsp; are made&nbsp; by it only when&nbsp; customers&nbsp; place&nbsp;&nbsp; their orders, does not alter the nature of the establishment, for it is obvious that it only accepted such&nbsp; orders as called for the&nbsp; employment of such materials-moulding,&nbsp; frames, panels-as it&nbsp; ordinarily manufactured or was in a position habitually to manufacture.</p><p>Perhaps&nbsp; the following&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; represents&nbsp; in&nbsp; brief "the appellant's position in this Court:</p><blockquote>"Since the petitioner, by clear proof of facts not disputed by the respondent, manufactures sash, windows and doors&nbsp; only for special customers&nbsp; and upon their special&nbsp; orders and in accordance&nbsp; with the desired specifications of the persons ordering the same and not for the&nbsp; general market: since the doors ordered by&nbsp; Don Toribio Teodoro &amp; Sons, Inc., for instance, are not in existence and&nbsp; which never would&nbsp; have existed but for&nbsp; the order of the party desiring it;&nbsp; and&nbsp; since petitioner's contractual relation with his&nbsp; customers is that of a&nbsp; contract for a piece of work or since&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; is engaged in the sale of services, it follows that the petitioner should ie taxed under section 191 of the Tax Code and NOT under section 185 of the same Code."&nbsp; (Appellant's brief,&nbsp; p. 11-12).</blockquote><p>But the&nbsp; argument rests on&nbsp; a&nbsp; false&nbsp; foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any builder or&nbsp; homeowner, with&nbsp; sufficient money,&nbsp; may&nbsp; order windows or doors of the kind manufactured&nbsp; by this appellant.&nbsp; Therefore&nbsp; it is&nbsp; not true&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; serves special customers&nbsp; only&nbsp; or&nbsp; confines its&nbsp; services&nbsp; to them alone. And anyone who sees,&nbsp; and&nbsp; likes,&nbsp; the doors&nbsp; ordered by Don&nbsp; Toribio&nbsp; Teodoro &amp;&nbsp; Sons&nbsp; Inc. may purchase&nbsp;&nbsp; from appellant doors&nbsp; of the same kind, provided he pays the price.&nbsp; Surely, the appellant&nbsp; will not&nbsp; refuse,&nbsp; for it can easily duplicate&nbsp; or even mass-produce the same doors—it is mechanically&nbsp; equipped&nbsp; to do so.</p><p>That the&nbsp; doors and windows must&nbsp; meet&nbsp; desired&nbsp; specifications&nbsp; is neither here nor there.&nbsp;&nbsp; If these specifications do not happen to be of the kind habitually manufactured by appellant—special forms of sash, mouldings or panels— it would&nbsp; not accept&nbsp; the order—and no sale is&nbsp; made.&nbsp; If they do,&nbsp; the transaction would&nbsp; be&nbsp; no different&nbsp; from a purchasers of manufactured goods held is stock for sale; they are&nbsp; bought&nbsp; because&nbsp; they&nbsp; meet&nbsp; the&nbsp; specifications desired by the&nbsp; purchaser.</p><p>Nobody will&nbsp; say that when a sawmill cuts lumber in accordance with the peculiar specifications of a customer sizes not&nbsp; previously held in stock for sale to the publicity thereby becomes an employee or servant of the customer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> not the seller of lumber.&nbsp; The same consideration applies to this sash manufacturer.</p><p>The Oriental&nbsp; Sash Factory does nothing more than sell the goods that it mass-produces or habitually makes; sash, panels, mouldings,&nbsp; frames,&nbsp; cutting them;&nbsp; to&nbsp; such&nbsp; sizes, and&nbsp; combining them in such forms as its customers may desire.</p><p>On the&nbsp; other hand, petitioner's&nbsp; idea&nbsp; of being a contractor doing construction&nbsp; jobs&nbsp; is&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; Nobody would regard the doing of two window panels as construction work in common parlance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>Appellant invokes&nbsp; Article 1467 of the New&nbsp; Civil Code to bolster its contention that in filing orders for windows and&nbsp; doors according to specifications, it did not sell, but merely contracted for particular pieces of work or "merely sold its services".</p><p>Said article reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>"A&nbsp; contract for the&nbsp; delivery at a&nbsp; certain price of an&nbsp; article which the vendor&nbsp; in the ordinary course of his business manufactures or procures&nbsp; for the general market, whether the same is on hand at the time or not, is a&nbsp; contract of sale, but if the goods are to be manufactured specially for&nbsp; the customer and upon&nbsp; his special order,&nbsp; and not for the&nbsp; general market, it is&nbsp; contract&nbsp; 16c a piece of work." </p></blockquote><p>It is at once apparent that the Oriental Sash Factory did not merely sell<em> its services</em> to Don Toribio Teddoro &amp; Co.&nbsp; (To take&nbsp; one&nbsp; instance)&nbsp; because it also sold&nbsp; the materials.&nbsp; The truth of the matter is that it sold materials ordinarily manufactured by it—sash, panels, mouldings— to Teodoro &amp; Co., although in such form&nbsp; or&nbsp; combination as suited the fancy of the purchaser.&nbsp; Such new form does not divest the Oriental Sash Factory&nbsp; of its character as manufacturer.&nbsp; Neither does it take the transaction out of the category of sales under Article 1467 above quoted, because&nbsp; although the Factory&nbsp; does not, in the&nbsp; ordinary course&nbsp; of its business, manufacture and&nbsp; keep on stock doors&nbsp; of the&nbsp; hind sold&nbsp; to Teodoro, it could stock&nbsp; and/or probably had in stock the sash,&nbsp; mouldings and panels it iised therefor (some of them at least).</p><p>In our opinion when this Factory&nbsp; accepts&nbsp; a&nbsp; job that requires the use of extraordinary or additional equipment, or involves services not&nbsp; generally performed by it—it thereby contracts for a <em>piece of work</em>—filling special orders within the meaning of Article 1467.&nbsp; The orders herein exhibited were not shown to be special.&nbsp; They were merely orders for work—nothing is&nbsp; shown to call them&nbsp; special .requiring extraordinary service of the factory.</p><p>The&nbsp; thought occurs to&nbsp; us that if,&nbsp; as&nbsp; alleged—all the work&nbsp; of appellant is only to&nbsp; fill orders previously made, such orders should not be called <em>special work</em>,&nbsp; but regular work.&nbsp; Would&nbsp; a factory&nbsp; do&nbsp; business&nbsp; performing only special,&nbsp; extraordinary or&nbsp; preculiar merchandise?</p><p>Anyway, supposing for the moment that the transactions were&nbsp; not sales,&nbsp; they were neither&nbsp; lease of services nor contract&nbsp; jobs by&nbsp; a&nbsp; contractor.&nbsp; But as&nbsp; the doors&nbsp; and windows had been&nbsp; admittedly&nbsp; "manufactured"&nbsp; by the Oriental&nbsp; Sash Factory, such transactions could be,&nbsp; and should be taxed as "transfers" thereof under section 186 of the National&nbsp; Revenue Code.</p><p>The appealed decision&nbsp; is&nbsp; consequently affirmed.&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
