				G.R. No. L-1861, May 27, 1949</h4>
				<H3>RIZAL SURETY AND INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS. BIENVENIDO A. TAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, BIBIANO L. MEER, COLLECTOR OF INTERNAL REVENUE, GREGORIO GUTIERREZ, SOFRONIO S. PASOLA, AND BENITO D. GUEVARA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On September 19, 1947, Judge Ambrosio Santos of the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against 
the defendants in civil case No. 167 of said court, entitled "Rizal Surety and 
Insurance Company, Inc., plaintiff, vs. Gregorio Gutierrez, Sofronio S. Pasola, 
and Benito D. Guevara, defendants," foreclosing a real estate mortgage executed 
by the defendant Gregorio Gutierrez in favor of the plaintiff. On October 9, 
1947, the Collector of Internal Revenue, through an assistant provincial fiscal 
of Rizal, filed in said case a "motion ot set aside judgment and allow the 
Collector of Internal Revenue to intervene as party plaintiff," alleging that 
two of the defendants, namely, Sofronio S. Pasola and Benito D. Guevara, were 
indebted to the Republic of the Philippines in the amount of P15,727 as 
deficiency specific tax. There is no allegation in the motion that the 
Government had any registered lien on the property the mortgage on which was 
sought to be foreclosed by the plaindiff, it appearing from the complaint that 
the mortgagor of said property was the other defendant Gregorio Gutierrez. Over 
the opposition of the plaintiff, the respondent judge granted the motion of the 
Collector of Internal Revenue and set aside the judgment in said case "to allow 
the Collector of Internal Revenue to present a claim of the Government against 
any of the parties interested in this case."
<p align="justify">The present petition for certiorari was filed in this court by 
the Rizal Surety and Insurance company, Inc., to annul said order of the 
respondent judge. Upon being required to answer the petition the collector of 
Internal Revenue, through the First Assistant Solicitor General, submitted the 
case for decision without filing an answer.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is meritorious. No relation has been shown between 
the claim of the Collector of Internal Revenue for deficiency specific tax 
against two of the defendants and the cause of action of the plaintiff against 
the three defendants in said case to justify the intervention of the said 
Collector of Internal Revenue therein as party plaintiff. It is not explained 
why the Collector of Internal Revenue could not file a separate action or pursue 
an independent remedy against the alleged delinquent taxpayers. Sections 1 and 3 
of Rule 13 of the Rules of Court provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SECTION 1. <i>When proper</i>.—A person may, at any period of 
a trial, be permitted by the court, in its discretion, to intervene in an 
action, if he has legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success 
of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or when he is so situated 
as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property 
in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof."</p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 3. <i>Discretion of court</i>.—In allowing or disallowing 
a motion for intervention, the court, in the exercise of discretion, shall 
consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the 
adjudication of the rights of the original parties and whether or not the 
intervenor's rights may be fully protected in a separate 
proceeding."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The case of the Collector of Internal Revenue does not come 
within the purview of the above-quoted provisions of the rule he invoked in the 
lower court. The Government has not shown that it has "legal interest in the 
matter in litigation," on the one hand, and, on the other , it was apparent that 
the intervention would unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights 
of the original parties. Moreover, "the intervenor's rights may be fully 
protected in a separate proceeding." Furthermore, the motion for intervention 
was filed after the trial and decision of the original case and therefore out of 
time.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence the respondent judge acted without authority of law and 
in excess of his jurisdiction in granting the motion for intervention and in 
setting aside the judgment rendered in said civil case No. 167.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is granted and the order of the respondent judge 
of November 21, 1947, is hereby set aside, without any finding as to costs. So 
ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C. J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon,
