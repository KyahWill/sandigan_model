				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This is&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal by&nbsp; certiorari by&nbsp; the Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Company, later&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to as the&nbsp; Firestone Co., from the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner on&nbsp; a claim&nbsp; by Vicente Tupas,&nbsp; appellant's former&nbsp;&nbsp; employee,&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; company to&nbsp; pay Tupas the amount of P464.53 for alleged partial permanent disability suffered by him.<br><br>The record shows the following facts:&nbsp; On, March&nbsp; 12, 1948, while Tupas, under the employ of the Firestone Co., was unloading boxes from&nbsp; the latter's truck, one&nbsp; of the boxes rolled down from&nbsp; the pile and caused&nbsp; injury to&nbsp; his head.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; sent to the Eiverview Hospital, where&nbsp; he was confined&nbsp; for&nbsp; about&nbsp; twenty-one&nbsp; days.&nbsp; Notice&nbsp; of the injury and claim for compensation was filed&nbsp; by him with the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Division of&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Labor on June&nbsp; 21, 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tupas&nbsp; was referred&nbsp; to the Medical&nbsp; Inspection&nbsp; Division of the Department of Labor for medical examination, after&nbsp; which&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Jose S. Santillan, Chief Medical Officer,&nbsp; and Dr. Teofilo V. Gonzales, Assistant Medical Officer, submitted&nbsp; their report on February 23, 1949, saying: <br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; walking individual fairly nourished and with normal gait. He&nbsp; answers questions&nbsp; intelligently.&nbsp; He&nbsp; complains of occasional dizziness&nbsp; especially during hot&nbsp; weather.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examination&nbsp; shows that heart&nbsp; and lungs are normal ...<br><br>"In my opinion the injury will not result to permanent disability. The dizziness which he is complaining, is only occasional and temporary.&nbsp;&nbsp; . , . <br><br>"ESTIMATE OF DISABILITIES: <br>Temporary Total:&nbsp; Received full pay since accident <br>Temporary partial:&nbsp; None <br>Permanent partial: None</blockquote>"Tupas was&nbsp; released from the hospital and&nbsp; he resumed work with the Firestone Co. on April 12, 1948 in different capacities.&nbsp; In the meantime, computation&nbsp; was made of the amount due to him for his temporary&nbsp; disability, particularly,&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was in the hospital,&nbsp; unable to work, and the Firestone Co. paid to him P78.00&nbsp; and&nbsp; spent P550.09 for his hospital&nbsp; and medical expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of said payment,&nbsp; Mrs. Nieves Baens&nbsp; del Rosario,&nbsp; Chief of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Division&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau of Labor,&nbsp; submitted a memorandum to the&nbsp; Director of Labor&nbsp; showing: said payment and recommending that the case be closed.&nbsp; Acting upon said recommendation, Felipe E. Jose,&nbsp; Director of Labor,&nbsp; closed the case by approving said recommendation on&nbsp; March 25, 1949. <br><br>From what we gather from the brief for the&nbsp; Firestone Co., it would&nbsp; appear that when Tupas reported&nbsp; for&nbsp; work after his&nbsp; release from the&nbsp; hospital, he was&nbsp; assigned as laborer in the company's warehouse&nbsp; at a&nbsp; daily wage of P4.00,&nbsp; and&nbsp; continued&nbsp; in&nbsp; that capacity until&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; when he was assigned and became a watchman,&nbsp; and&nbsp; at the same time as driver of Office Manager A.&nbsp; L. Bartolini, at the same&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; of&nbsp; P4.00 plus&nbsp; extra compensation as such driver from&nbsp; Bartolini.&nbsp; After the departure of the manager&nbsp; in March,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp;&nbsp; Tupas was transferred&nbsp; temporarily to&nbsp; the office&nbsp; as&nbsp; messenger to take invoices and other papers from&nbsp; one department to another, with compensation of P5.00&nbsp; to P6.50&nbsp; a day, until the latter&nbsp; part of July,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; when&nbsp; he was transferred to&nbsp; the warehouse. He was discharged on September 28,&nbsp; 1953, due&nbsp; to alleged insubordination, frequent absences,&nbsp; defaults,&nbsp; and irregularities in&nbsp; the performance of his duties, refusal&nbsp; to take errands,&nbsp; and abandonment of his work without permission from his immediate superior. <br><br>Shortly after his dismissal, he filed&nbsp; a claim with the office of the&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commissioner, a new office created in&nbsp; the Department&nbsp; of&nbsp; Labor,&nbsp; by Republic Act&nbsp; No. 772, approved&nbsp; on June 20,&nbsp; 1952, which Act&nbsp; abolished the old Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Division of the Bureau of&nbsp; Labor,&nbsp; under Act No. 3428.&nbsp; The claim was&nbsp; for&nbsp; alleged partial permanent&nbsp; disability, supposedly supported by a medical&nbsp; report or certificate of&nbsp; one Dr. Jose Jose, dated October 14, 195S,&nbsp; saying that: <br><blockquote>"To all appearances&nbsp; corroborated&nbsp; by the clinical&nbsp; history of the patient and the injury received, the patient has suffered from&nbsp; cerebral&nbsp; contussion and&nbsp; concussion and possible fracture&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of the injury with&nbsp; the late sequelae&nbsp; and&nbsp; complicating&nbsp; traumatic epilepsy and changed personality." </blockquote>It would&nbsp; appear that the Medical&nbsp; Officer of&nbsp; the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Commission also&nbsp;&nbsp; examined&nbsp; Tupas and&nbsp; submitted a medical&nbsp; report, dated November 6, 1953, to the effect that&nbsp; the&nbsp; claimant had suffered&nbsp; a 24% nonscheduled disability, permanent, partial.&nbsp; On the basis&nbsp; of said report,&nbsp; the Commission issued a letter&nbsp; computation, dated November 23,&nbsp; 1953, showing that&nbsp; the Firestone Co. was&nbsp; called upon to pay Tupas the amount of&nbsp; P41.25 under Section&nbsp;&nbsp; 14&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; as amended, and P493.02 under Section 18 of the same&nbsp; law, or a total of P534.27.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Firestone&nbsp; Co. answered the claim of&nbsp; Tupas and moved that it be&nbsp; dismissed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case was&nbsp; referred to a referee&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Commission, Mr.&nbsp; Juan M. Gerardo.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the hearing held by him, the Firestone Co. reiterated its motion&nbsp; for dismissal on the ground&nbsp; that after the case was closed on March 25, 1949 by the Workmen's Compensation Division&nbsp; of the Bureau&nbsp; of Labor, which closure was&nbsp; approved by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director of Labor, its&nbsp; successor, the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commission no longer had jurisdiction to reopen the case.<br><br>Acting upon said&nbsp; motion&nbsp; and&nbsp; over the&nbsp; objection&nbsp; of counsel for claimant&nbsp; Tupas, the referee issued a&nbsp; resolution on&nbsp; February 20, 1954,&nbsp; dismissing the proceedings, on&nbsp; the ground that the case could no longer be reopened for the&nbsp; purpose of awarding claimant Tupas additional compensation; that although&nbsp; Republic Act No. 772, particularly, Section 13 thereof, amending the Old Workmen's Compensation Act (Act No. 3428),&nbsp; providing that after a claimant, has been&nbsp; paid for any disability specified&nbsp; by the Act, the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commissioner may from time to time cause the examination of said disabled laborer with a view to extending1, if&nbsp; necessary, the period of&nbsp; compensation,&nbsp; nevertheless, said&nbsp; legal provision&nbsp; can only be applied to&nbsp; cases arising after its promulgation on June 20, 1952, and cannot possibly cover the case of Tupas which arose in March,&nbsp; 1948,&nbsp; this,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reason that in the absence of a clear intention of the Legislature to the contrary, the Act&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; given&nbsp; a prospective effect. <br><br>Tupas took the&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Commissioner for review,&nbsp; and&nbsp; said Commissioner rendered' a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 9, 19S5, reversing the resolution and awarding to Tupas the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P464.53, which&nbsp; is the amount' of his total&nbsp; compensation of P542.53 minus the sum of&nbsp; P78.00 previously paid to him by the Firestone Co.&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1948. <br><br>The law involved&nbsp; and applied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; referee&nbsp; and&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Commissioner is&nbsp; Section 18&nbsp; of Act No, 3428,&nbsp; as amended&nbsp; by Section&nbsp; 18&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 772, which for purposes&nbsp; of reference, we reproduce below: <br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 18. <i>Amputation</i>.â€”Amputation&nbsp; between&nbsp; elbow and&nbsp; wrist shall be considered as equivalent to the loss of a hand.&nbsp; Amputation between knee and ankle shall be considered as loss of a foot. Amputation at or&nbsp; above the elbow&nbsp; shall be considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; equivalent to the loss of an arm.&nbsp; Amputation at or above the knee&nbsp; shall be considered as equivalent&nbsp; to the loss of a leg. <br><br>"Compensation for&nbsp; the injuries&nbsp; above specified shall exclude&nbsp; all other&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; except the benefits provided&nbsp; for in&nbsp; sections thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen.</blockquote>"In&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; an injury producing a serious disfigurement of the face or head, the Commissioner may, at the request of an interested party, determine and award&nbsp; such compensation&nbsp; as&nbsp; may seem fair and proper in view of the nature of&nbsp; the&nbsp; disfigurement, but which shall not exceed four thousand pesos.<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; all other eases of this kind of disability not&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; in other&nbsp; sections&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Act,&nbsp; the compensation&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; fifty per centum&nbsp; of&nbsp; the difference&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; average weekly wages&nbsp; of the injured person&nbsp; and his&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; earning capacity in&nbsp; the&nbsp; same or&nbsp; some other employment,&nbsp; payable&nbsp; while the partial&nbsp; disability lasts;&nbsp; but subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; of the degree of impairment by the Commissioner&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; request&nbsp; of an-interested&nbsp; party:&nbsp; <i>Provided,&nbsp; however,</i> That the weekly payments shall in no&nbsp; case be continued for a period longer&nbsp; than two hundred and eight weeks. <br><br>"The total compensation&nbsp; prescribed in this and the next preceding section&nbsp; and the total compensation prescribed in sections four- teen and fifteen of this Act shall, together,&nbsp; not exceed the sum&nbsp; of four thousand&nbsp; pesos:&nbsp; <i>Provided,&nbsp; however,</i>&nbsp; That&nbsp; after&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment has&nbsp; been made for the period specified by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Act in each&nbsp; case, the Workmen's Compensation' Commissioner may&nbsp; from time to&nbsp; time cause&nbsp; the examination&nbsp; of&nbsp; the condition of the&nbsp; disabled&nbsp; laborer, with a view to extending, if&nbsp; necessary, the period&nbsp; of&nbsp; compensation which&nbsp; shall not, however, exceed the said amount of four&nbsp; thousand pesos." <br><br>On&nbsp; this point, we quote&nbsp; a portion of the decision of the Commissioner: "The&nbsp; counsel for both parties&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as the trial referee arc laboring under the&nbsp; impression that the award of 24% non-scheduled disability, permanent&nbsp; partial,&nbsp; in&nbsp; this particular&nbsp; case,&nbsp; was based on the provisions of the last paragraph of&nbsp; Sec. 18 of the Act.&nbsp; "We would&nbsp; like to&nbsp; point,&nbsp; however, that the&nbsp; right to this&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; was based&nbsp; on the penultimate paragraph&nbsp; of Sec. 18, which speaks&nbsp; of other&nbsp; cases of permanent&nbsp; partial disabilities and&nbsp; which&nbsp; provision of law was&nbsp; already&nbsp; in '"existence prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; enactment&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rep. Act No: 772.&nbsp; In other words, it refers to those permanent partial disabilities 'which&nbsp; are not&nbsp; scheduled&nbsp; and are aside from&nbsp; the disabilities&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; in&nbsp; Sees.&nbsp; 14, 15, and 17&nbsp; of the Act, like&nbsp; the loss of a&nbsp; spleen, or kidney.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; the&nbsp; last paragraph of See. 18,&nbsp; us&nbsp; amended&nbsp; by Rep. Act&nbsp; 772,&nbsp; speaks of the extension of the&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; compensation by&nbsp; the Commissioner,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; case so warrants, after&nbsp; payment has been&nbsp; made for the period specified by&nbsp; law in each of the different sections of the&nbsp; Act&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; to</blockquote> the&nbsp; case but said compensation shall not exceed the total amount of P4,000.00.<br><br>"The question that&nbsp; should have been resolved&nbsp; here&nbsp; is whether the&nbsp; 24%&nbsp; non-scheduled&nbsp; permanent partial&nbsp; disability suffered by the&nbsp; claimant, which had been&nbsp; traced to his&nbsp; previous&nbsp; injury and which manifested its&nbsp; seriousness&nbsp; only at a later&nbsp; date, should be compensated considering&nbsp; that he was not paid therefor by the respondent as no&nbsp; award on the&nbsp; basis of said&nbsp; disability was&nbsp; made by the Bureau of Labor."<br><br>In saying that the penultimate&nbsp; paragraph of&nbsp; Sec.&nbsp; 18 was&nbsp; already in existence prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; enactment of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act 772, the Commissioner&nbsp; apparently overlooked the fact that said penultimate paragraph&nbsp; before its amendment, referred to&nbsp; reconsideration by "a competent court", and not by the Commissioner, so&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter cannot make the&nbsp; reconsideration except under Republic Act&nbsp; 772. <br><br>After a careful&nbsp; study of the case, it appears to&nbsp; us&nbsp; that the legal point&nbsp; involved is whether Section 18, as&nbsp; amended, whether the last&nbsp; or&nbsp; the penultimate paragraph&nbsp; thereof can&nbsp; be applied to the present case, considering that&nbsp; the. injury took place in 1948, and Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 772 took effect&nbsp; only on&nbsp; June 20,&nbsp; 1952.&nbsp; We agree&nbsp; with&nbsp; Referee Gerardo that&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 772 should be&nbsp; given a prospective&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to the well-settled rule,&nbsp; in the absence of&nbsp; a clear intention of&nbsp; the Legislature to give it a&nbsp; retrospective effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 25 of said&nbsp; Republic Act 772 says that this Act shall take effect upon its approval. Nothing is said about its being made effective prior to its approval. <br><br>In the case of Amado vs. Olabarrieta, Inc., 95 Phil.,&nbsp; 83, we declined to give said Republic Act a retrospective effect. Said this Tribunal through Mr. Justice Roberto Concepcion: <br><br>"Plaintiff's claim is&nbsp; admittedly&nbsp; predicated upon&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No,&nbsp; 3428, otherwise known as the Workmen's Compensation Act.&nbsp; The same was amended, first, by&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 3812, then by&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 210 and, lastly, by&nbsp; Republic Act No. 772.&nbsp; The latter, however, took effect on June 20, 1952 or after the&nbsp; accident upon which plaintiff bases her cause of action.&nbsp; Hence, in the consideration of this case,&nbsp; we shall disregard the provisions&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Republic Act No. 772.&nbsp; * * *." <br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp; injury took place in March, 1948.&nbsp; Two doctors of the&nbsp; then Medical Inspection Division of the Bureau of . Labor&nbsp; examined him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said examination must have taken some time and&nbsp; in&nbsp; all. probability&nbsp; not&nbsp; only once but&nbsp; on different occasions, because as already stated, the report was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; only in February,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; or&nbsp; about a year after . the injury.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said two doctors&nbsp; rendered the opinion that it&nbsp; involved&nbsp; only temporary disability.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; he was able to resume work and continue working from April 12, 1948 until he was dismissed on September&nbsp; 28, 1953, a period of about five years,&nbsp; including driving a&nbsp; car from 1949 until March, 1953, apparently without any complaint about his&nbsp; health, reinforces&nbsp; the belief&nbsp; that there was&nbsp; no permanent disability&nbsp; caused&nbsp; by his injury; and bearing in mind that he thought of claiming&nbsp; further compensation&nbsp; for alleged permanent&nbsp; partial disability only after he had been dismissed from the service, said circumstance does not exactly free&nbsp; one from doubt and&nbsp; suspicion about the validity&nbsp; and merit&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he had himself examined by&nbsp; Dr. Jose Jose, but it should be remembered that the report of a&nbsp; doctor examining&nbsp; a patient is&nbsp; based in great measure upon&nbsp; what said patient tells him&nbsp; about how he feels, his&nbsp; reflexes, the&nbsp; keenness of his senses,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; this, specially when&nbsp; as in the present&nbsp; case, the alleged illness or incapacity is more mental than physical, over which the doctor&nbsp; has not the time, facility or opportunity to check andxonclusively determine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; after the payment by the Firestone Co.&nbsp; to Tupas for the money loss he suffered during the&nbsp; time of his confinement in the hospital,&nbsp; and the expenditure for the medical.and hospital expenses incurred by him amounting to P553.00, Tupas&nbsp; apparently was fully satisfied; the case was&nbsp; finally settled, and upon recommendation of&nbsp; the Chief of the&nbsp; Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Division of the Bureau of Labor, the Director of the Bureau closed the case.&nbsp; It would manifestly be&nbsp; unfair, after a&nbsp; period of more than five&nbsp; years, for Tupas and&nbsp; the&nbsp; present Workmen's Compensation Commission to reopen the case and apply a law which had been&nbsp; promulgated long&nbsp; after&nbsp; said&nbsp; closure of the case.&nbsp; Said case had been settled under the law existing&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time,&nbsp; namely, the Workmen's Compensation Act, (Act No. 3428).&nbsp; The Firestone&nbsp; Co. paid&nbsp; due compensation.&nbsp; Besides, under said&nbsp; Act No. 3428, Section 29, it is provided in&nbsp; the&nbsp; last&nbsp; part thereof&nbsp; "that the employer shall be exempt from all&nbsp; liability under this&nbsp; Act as soon at&nbsp; the&nbsp; compensation has&nbsp; been&nbsp; paid&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with this&nbsp; section". <br><br>We&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that&nbsp; the case&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; definitely&nbsp; closed in 1949, under the provisions of the law&nbsp; existing, and without deciding&nbsp; whether Section 13&nbsp; of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 772 is pertinent to a&nbsp; similar case if arising after the promulgation of said Republic Act, we equally hold that said Republic Act No. 772&nbsp; cannot be applied to&nbsp; the present case. <br><br>In view of the foregoing, the&nbsp; appealed decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner is hereby reversed and&nbsp; the claim of respondent Tupas&nbsp; is hereby dismissed in accordance with the resolution of Referee Gerardo. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception,&nbsp; Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L.,&nbsp; Endencia</i> and <i>Felix,&nbsp; JJ,,</i> concur.</div>
