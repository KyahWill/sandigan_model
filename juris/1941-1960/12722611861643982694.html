				<H3>FELIPE B. PAGKANLUNGAN, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. HON. MANUEL DE LA FUENTE, AS MAYOR, CITY OF MANILA; HON. MARCELINO SARMIENTO, AS TREASURER, CITY OF MANILA; AND HON. AQUILINO CALIXTO, AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CITY TREASURY ANTI-GRAFT-AND-CORRUPTION COMMITTEE, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Court of 
First Instance of Manila denying a petition for a writ of prohibition and 
mandamus filed by Felipe B. Pagkanlungan against the City Mayor, City Treasurer, 
and Assistant City Treasurer, of Manila. 
<p align="justify">The facts which are not disputed are as follows: </p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner is a Civil Service employee of the Market Division, 
City Treasurer's Office of Manila. For some irregularities allegedly committed 
by him in office, he was ordered on October 25, 1949, by the City Treasurer to 
submit within 72 hours a written answer to a set of charges filed against him. 
Although he had complied with the said order in due time, nothing was heard 
about the case from the City Treasurer. However, six months later the respondent 
Mayor required him again to answer and explain the same charges, and ordered at 
the same time his suspension, pending the investigation of the said charges. 
Again nothing was done about these charges, notwithstanding the lapse of six 
months. So, he applied for reinstatement to his position, on the ground that the 
City Mayor has no power, under the law, to investigate City Officers and 
employees, following the ruling enunciated by the Supreme Court in the 
Francia-Subido case. This petition was denied by the respondent Mayor, on the 
ground that the above-mentioned ruling does not apply to him. </p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime the City Treasurer ordered his assistant, who 
is the chairman of the Anti-graft and Corruption Committee of his Office, to 
comply with the Mayor's order, and asked the petitioner to submit to an 
investigation by the said Committee, on Sept. 4, 1950. Forthwith the petitioner 
filed an appeal to the Secretary of the Interior from the Mayor's order, but 
without awaiting the result thereof, he filed this petition. </p>
<p align="justify">The ruling in the case of Francia vs Subido,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> 47 Off. Gaz., (No. 
12, Supp.) 296, does not apply to the herein petitioner, because unlike the City 
Auditor the petitioner is an employee appointed by the Mayor. There, the 
respondent as chief of the Division of Investigation in the office of the City 
Mayor had no power to investigate an officer or employee not appointed by the 
Mayor and could not exercise the powers and perform the duties vested in the 
City Fiscal. Here, the Mayor is clothed with the authority and power to 
investigate the petitioner who is an employee not appointed by the President of 
the Philippines. Section 11 (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) of Rep. Act No. 409, the Charter of the City of 
Manila which took effect on 18 June 1949, vests in the Mayor the power and duty 
"to see that executive officers and employees of the city properly discharge 
their respective duties" and section 22 thereof empowers him to suspend and 
remove, subject to appeal to the Secretary of the Interior, any city officer or 
employee not appointed by the President of the Philippines and to recommend to 
the latter the suspension or removal of any city officer appointed by him. The 
authority and power to make an inquiry or to conduct an investigation, to the 
end that the power to suspend and remove expressly granted may be justly and 
fairly exercised, is implied in the power expressly granted. Section 38 of 
Republic Act No. 409, which provides that the City Fiscal is empowered to 
investigate any neglect or misconduct in office brought to his knowledge and to 
report to the Mayor thereon, does not deprive the latter of the authority and 
power to conduct an investigation under section 22 of the same Act. The powers 
vested in the Mayor and the City Fiscal may coexist.</p>
<p align="justify">Our attention has not been called to nor have we found any 
statute, executive order or regulation promulgated pursuant to law, which makes 
it the duty of the suspending officer to reinstate a suspended subordinate 
officer or employee after two months of suspension and to pay or to order the 
salary paid to the latter. Section 695 of the Revised Administrative Code, as 
amended by Com. Acts Nos. 177 and 598, which provides that the Commissioner of 
Civil Service (now the City Mayor) "may, for neglect of duty or violation of 
reasonable office regulations, * * * remove any subordinate officer or employee 
from the service, suspend him without pay for not more than two months * * *" 
contemplates a final action by the Commissioner (Mayor) after inquiry and has no 
reference to limitation of the period of suspension of the suspended subordinate 
officer or employee, as found in section 2272 of the same Code, as amended, 
dealing with suspension of members of the municipal police. Section 260 of the 
same Code does not limit the suspension of the payment of salary to two months 
but expressly provides that during suspension the salary shall not be paid, 
subject to "the application of the disciplinary provisions of section six 
hundred and ninety-five hereof."</p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant. </p>
