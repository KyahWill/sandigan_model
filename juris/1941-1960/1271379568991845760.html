				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Yolanda E. Sarmiento,&nbsp; the&nbsp; complainant-appellant, filed on October 8, 1954 with the Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace&nbsp; Court of Lilio, Laguna, a&nbsp; complaint for&nbsp; serious illegal detention against&nbsp; Ernesto Natoza and John Doe.&nbsp; Thereupon&nbsp; the Justice&nbsp; of the Peace conducted the corresponding investigation in accordance with&nbsp; Sec. 7, Rule 108 of the Rules of Court and&nbsp; subsequently issued the warrant of arrest against the&nbsp; accused.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the arrest the case was set for October&nbsp; 23, 1954 for the formal preliminary investigation and, to that affect, notices were issued to&nbsp; the accused Ernesto&nbsp; Natoza&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; the complainant and&nbsp; her witnesses.&nbsp; On that date, Natoza entered a formal waiver of his right to a&nbsp; preliminary investigation and at the same time asked that the case be remanded to the Court of First Instance of Lacuna.&nbsp; Accordingly, the record of the case was sent to the Court of First Instance of Laguna where it was docketed as Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 16137.&nbsp; On November&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1954 the&nbsp; assistant provincial fiscal of Laguna reinvestigated the case upon previous notification&nbsp; to the complainant-appellant and her counsel and the accused to be present there.&nbsp; Appellant and&nbsp; her counsel failed, however, to appear at the reinvestigation, while the accused did and presented, evidence in his behalf; and the assistant provincial fiscal&nbsp; of Laguna, after considering the evidence for the complainant formerly presented before the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace of Lilio and&nbsp; that adduced by the accused at the reinvestigation, filed&nbsp; a motion for dismissal, the pertinent portions of which are as follows:<br><blockquote>"A reinvestigation of this case was conducted by the.Office of the Provincial Fiscal on November 6, 1954, notice&nbsp; thereof having been given to the private prosecutor; and at such hearing the accused Ernesto&nbsp; Natoza&nbsp; offered evidence in&nbsp; his own behalf.&nbsp; No&nbsp; appearance was however&nbsp; made by&nbsp; the&nbsp; offended party or her counsel.&nbsp; At such&nbsp; reinvestigation evidence&nbsp; was&nbsp; submitted consisting of no less than&nbsp; five&nbsp; (5) letters addressed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Yolanda&nbsp; Sarmiento to&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; Ernesto Natoza and sufficiently established to be in 'the handwriting of Yolanda Sarmiento, as reflected by a&nbsp; comparison with her classroom theme papers submitted also by the defendant. The nature&nbsp; of these five letters conclusively show an amorous relation between&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused.&nbsp; The&nbsp; profuse&nbsp; endearing&nbsp; terms therein negative&nbsp; the necessity of threat and force that was allegedly employed by the accused on said Yolanda Sarmiento.<br><br>"The time and the occasion for the&nbsp; start of the&nbsp; alleged ,offense in the premises&nbsp; of the Lilio&nbsp; Academy at 9:00 in&nbsp; the morning in the presence of many spectators likewise make it difficult to sustain the claim of&nbsp; intimidation or threat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Testimony has been offered at the reinvestigation by Lina Suiza,&nbsp; a classmate&nbsp; of the&nbsp; offended party, who positively averred that Yolanda Sarmiento was alone when&nbsp; she boarded the LTB&nbsp; truck of&nbsp; her own free will and even entrusted her&nbsp; books&nbsp; to said&nbsp; witness prior&nbsp; to her departure.&nbsp; This is corroborated no less by Miss Josefina Virina, a faculty member of the Lilio Academy who boarded the same bua and saw Yolanda Sarmiento take the truck alone and that the accused Ernesto Natoza was already in the LTB bus even&nbsp; before Yolanda Sarmiento took the same vehicle.&nbsp; This same witness&nbsp; stated that&nbsp; Yolanda Sarmiento sat beside the driver at the left side of the&nbsp; bus, sitting separately and at some&nbsp; distance away from the accused.&nbsp; Throughout the journey from Lilio to San Pablo City there was more than ample opportunity for the offended party to seek help or make an outcry especially under&nbsp; the circumstances above recited and there was none made by her.&nbsp; Upon reaching San Pablo City this opportunity could even&nbsp; be greater for she&nbsp; had to transfer tar another truck to reach Pila and again no protest was registered or shown to have&nbsp; been made.&nbsp; The&nbsp; conduct of these&nbsp; two young people upon their arrival at Pila as testified,to by&nbsp; Lilia&nbsp; Natoza tend strongly to show a simple impulsive adventure&nbsp; of two&nbsp; young people nearly enough to an elopement which was however frustrated by the efforts of the guardian aunt of the Offended party, ' All the foregoing circumstanees supported by evidence both oral and documentary most strongly refute the uncorroborated charge&nbsp; of illegal detention and there is so evidence that any other criminal offense has been committed."</blockquote>On November 9, 1954, this motion was granted by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Laguna.&nbsp; On&nbsp; .November 20, 1954, the complainant's&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; for reconsideration of the order of dismissal on the ground that the&nbsp; complainant-appellant and her witness Regina&nbsp; Sarmiento were not present in the reinvestigation&nbsp; conducted by the&nbsp; assistant provincial fiscal of Laguna, alleging that they&nbsp; were not duly notified&nbsp; therefor and that&nbsp; said reinvestigation was unconstitutional and illegal and made without "due process of&nbsp; law".&nbsp; The court denied this motion for reconsideration on November&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1954, but,&nbsp; again,&nbsp; on December 20, 1954&nbsp; another petition for reconsideration was filed on the&nbsp; ground that the&nbsp; aforementioned reinvestigation of the case done by&nbsp; the assistant provincial fiscal was contrary to sections 5 and 6, Rule 108 of the Rules of Court and in open violation&nbsp; of the due process clause of our&nbsp; fundamental&nbsp; law. Said petition for reconsideration was also denied,&nbsp; hence the present appeal on&nbsp; the ground that the lower court erred in ordering the dismissal of the complaint and in not holding that the procedure followed in the&nbsp; reinvestigation conducted by assistant provincial fiscal Alampay was contrary to law&nbsp; and the Constitution.<br><br>Carefully considered, we find no merit in the foregoing contention.&nbsp; The record does not disclose any abuse on the part of the assistant provincial&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; in&nbsp; conducting the reinvestigation.&nbsp; He filed the&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; dismissal after weighing the testimonies&nbsp; of the complainant-appellant and her&nbsp; witness&nbsp; Regina Sarmiento, which were&nbsp; attached to the record of the&nbsp; case, as&nbsp; well as the evidence presented by the&nbsp; accused during the&nbsp; reinvestigation.&nbsp; He submitted a well-reasoned&nbsp; motion for dismissal and the lower court, after carefully examining the motion for dismissal, granted it.&nbsp; There was, therefore, no abuse either on the part of the provincial&nbsp; fiscal or&nbsp; the trial court in acting on the case as they did.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it appears that the issues raised by the appellant in connection with the power o.f the&nbsp; fiscal to&nbsp; file the motion for dismissal and the authority of the trial court&nbsp; to&nbsp; grant&nbsp; it&nbsp; were squarely resolved by this Court in Gonzales <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Court of First Instance of Bulacan, 63 Phil. 846, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Orais and Jimenez,&nbsp; 65&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 744, where it was held&nbsp; that the provincial fiscal who&nbsp; finds the evidence in the preliminary investigation as well as that presented to&nbsp; him insufficient to establish, at least <span style="font-style: italic;">prima fade,</span> the guilt of the accused, has perfect authority&nbsp; to file&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion for dismissal,&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; judge who dismissed&nbsp; the&nbsp; case, upon motion&nbsp; of the fiscal on the ground of&nbsp; insufficient&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; to&nbsp; establish <span style="font-style: italic;">prima fade</span> the guilt of the accused, commits no reversible error.&nbsp; And this is so because, under Section 4,&nbsp; Rule 106 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court, all criminal&nbsp; actions shall be prosecuted under the&nbsp; direction and control of the fiscal.<br><br>With reference&nbsp; to appellant's contention that&nbsp; the&nbsp; reinvestigation of the case conducted by the assistant provincial&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; of Laguna&nbsp; was&nbsp; illegal and unconstitutional in that it&nbsp; was done without notice to the complainant or her counsel, we find, in the first place, that, according to the motion for dismissal, the complainant and her counsel were notified of&nbsp; said reinvestigation but that they&nbsp; failed to appear thereat, and between complainant's claim that she was not notified and the fiscal's contention that notification was duly issued to the complainant&nbsp; and her counsel', we are more inclined to believe in the fiscal's contention, for&nbsp; the presumption is that the law was obeyed&nbsp; and official duty was regularly performed.&nbsp; In the second place, even&nbsp; without the notification, the&nbsp; provincial fiscal is clothed with authority to make investigation of the case for the purpose&nbsp; of satisfying himself whether the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of record is sufficient for the&nbsp; filing of&nbsp; the corresponding information, and if after his investigation he finds that no sufficient&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; warrants the prosecution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case, it is within his authority, as prosecuting officer, to file the corresponding&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss which, if granted, cannot be appealed by the offended party who, under the law, has no Tight even to compel&nbsp; the fiscal or the court, thru mandamus, to proceed with the case&nbsp; unless there is a clear abuse of discretion on their part, which the record of the&nbsp; case fails to show.<br><br>Wherefore, finding no errors in the order appealed from, the same&nbsp; is hereby affirmed.<br><br><i>Paras, C J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., </i>and <i> Felix, JJ., </i> concur.</div>
