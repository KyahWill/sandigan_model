				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Civil Case No. 4634 of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, 
Domingo Caluya et al. <i>vs</i>. Mariano Asis et al., said court, presided over 
by Judge Francisco E. Jose, issued an order dated July 24, 1941, directing the 
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants and 
their agents or representatives from entering the parcels of land involved in 
the first and second causes of action of plaintiffs' complaint, or interfering 
with the latter's possession. Said order was issued after a hearing in which 
both parties adduced their respective evidence. Under date of May 15, 1946, the 
defendants, through their counsel, filed an unverified motion for the 
dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction, to which motion the attorneys 
for the plaintiffs in due time interposed an opposition. At the hearing of this 
motion the attorneys for opposing parties orally argued their respective sides 
without, however, presenting any evidence. In an order dated September 4, 1946, 
the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, then presided over by Judge Simeon 
Ramos, directed the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction upon the 
filing by the defendants of a bond in the sum of P5,000. Upon motion for 
reconsideration filed by the attorneys for the plaintiffs, Judge Ramos issued 
another order dated October 9, 1946, providing that said injunction should be 
maintained as regards the six parcels involved in plaintiffs' second cause of 
action, upon the filing by said plaintiffs of a bond in the sum of P6,000, and 
that said injunction should be dissolved as regards the three parcels involved 
in plaintiffs' first cause of action, upon the filing by the defendants of a 
bond in the sum of P3,000. The bonds required in the orders of September 4, 
1946, and October 9, 1946, had been filed by the defendants and approved by 
Judge Ramos, although they were previously subscribed before and approved by the 
justice of the peace of the capital. It appears that meanwhile the attorneys for 
the plaintiffs had complained, by proper motions for contempt, before the Court 
of First Instance of Ilocos Norte of alleged violations by the defendants of the 
writ of preliminary injunction prior to the orders dissolving the same, which 
motions have so far remained pending.
<p>In the instant special civil action for certiorari instituted by the 
petitioners (plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 4634) the simple question raised in 
the rather voluminous pleadings is whether Judge Simeon Ramos, now one of the 
respondents, acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of 
discretion, in ordering the dissolution of the writ of preliminary injunction as 
regards the parcels involved in plaintiffs' (petitioners') first cause of action 
in civil case No. 4634.</p>
<p>The first contention of the petitioners is that, as said injunction was 
issued after a hearing, the same cannot be dissolved, specially on the strength 
of an unverified motion for dissolution and in the absence of proper evidence to 
support it. Reliance is placed on section 6 of Rule 60 of the Rules of Court 
which provides that "the injunction may be reduced, or, if granted <i>ex 
parte</i>, may be dissolved," thereby arguing that if an injunction is not 
issued <i>ex parte</i> the same cannot be dissolved. The contention is clearly 
erroneous. Although said section prescribes the grounds for objecting to, or for 
moving the dissolution of, a preliminary injunction prior to its issuance or 
after its granting <i>ex parte</i>, it does not thereby outlaw a dissolution if 
the injunction has been issued after a hearing. This is to be so, because a writ 
of preliminary injunction is an interlocutory order which is always under the 
control of the court before final judgment. (Manila Electric Company <i>vs</i>. 
Artiaga and Green, 50 Phil., 144, 147.) And it is at no moment whether the judge 
dissolving an injunction is different. from that who issued it, since a judge of 
first instance is not legally prevented from revoking the interlocutory order of 
another judge in the very litigation subsequently assigned to him for judicial 
action, and the former is not required to hear the parties, if and when a 
reading of the record convinces him that the order should be revoked because 
improperly granted or that it should be disapproved. (Ong Su Han <i>vs</i>. 
Gutierrez David, 76 Phil., 546.)</p>
<p>Petitioners' criticism that the motion to dissolve filed by the defendants in 
Civil Case No. 4634 was not verified, is also groundless inasmuch as even an 
indirect verbal application for the dissolution of an <i>ex parte</i> order of 
preliminary injunction has been held to be a sufficient compliance with the 
provisions of section 6 of Rule 60 (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 
Second Edition, Vol. II, p. 65, citing the case of Sy Yam Bio <i>vs</i>. 
Barrios, 63 Phil., 206), the obvious reason being that said rule does not 
prescribe the form by which an application for the dissolution or modification 
of an order of preliminary injunction should be presented. (<i>Id</i>.) The fact 
that the defendants in civil case No. 4634 did not submit any evidence in 
support of their motion for dissolution, does not also help petitioners' side, 
for the reason that said motion relied on the evidence already on record. And 
the respondent judge appears to have done the same in granting the motion. At 
any rate, as already stated, the respondent judge was not even required to hear 
the parties, if the record convinced him that the writ of preliminary injunction 
should be dissolved. (Ong Su Han <i>vs</i>. Gutierrez David, <i>supra</i>.) 
Specifically, it has been held that, in dissolving an injunction already issued, 
the court cannot be considered as having acted without jurisdiction or with 
excess of jurisdiction, even if the dissolution has been made without previous 
notice to the adverse party, and without a hearing. (Moran, Comments on the 
Rules of Court, Second Edition, Vol. II, p. 66.)</p>
<p>The petitioners also allege that the bonds filed by the defendants in Civil 
Case No. 4634 for the dissolution of the injunction were approved only by the 
justice of the peace of the capital. The allegation may be admitted, but the 
defect, if any, is cured by the subsequent approval of said bonds by the 
respondent judge himself. Neither is the failure of said defendants to furnish 
the petitioners with copies of the bonds prior to their approval sufficient to 
invalidate the orders now complained of. In the first place, the attorneys for 
the petitioners were notified of the filing of the first bond. In the second 
place, they ultimately received copies of the bonds, after which they had all 
the chances to except to their sufficiency or to the solvency of the sureties, 
this being the only apparent purpose of section 8 of Rule 60 requiring that "the 
party filing a bond * * * shall forthwith serve a copy of such bond on the other 
party." In the third place, the petitioners do not here contend that the 
aforesaid bonds are insufficient or that the sureties are not solvent.</p>
<p>The further circumstance that the petitioners' motions for contempt were 
still pending at the time the preliminary injunction was dissolved, does not 
make the orders of the respondent judge improper, since the contempt incident 
may be looked into even after the dissolution of the injunction, as the 
contemptuous acts are alleged to have been previously committed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is denied with costs against the petitioners. So 
ordered.</p><i>Perfecto, Hilado, Briones,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> 
concur.</div>
