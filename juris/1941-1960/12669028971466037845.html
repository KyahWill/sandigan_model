				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Appeal from the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals sustaining the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue's imposition of a deficiency compensating tax.&nbsp; We think the decision should be affirmed.<br><br>On September&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; the S/S President&nbsp; Wilson brought in a Mercury automobile consigned to F. F. Hamlin, an American resident of Cebu City.&nbsp; Transhipped to Cebu, the car arrived there on September 21, 1950, aboard the F/S Albert.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hamlin took it from the customhouse on September 23, 1950, after paying thereon a compensating tax of P927.95, at the rate of 15% of the total value as evidence by an official receipt dated September&nbsp; 22, 1950. Because Republic Act 588, effective&nbsp; September 22, 1950, had increased the compensating tax to 50% of&nbsp; the total value of the automobile, the Collector of Internal Revenue in 1954, demanded payment of the deficiency tax: P2,164.31.<br><br>Refusing to pay, Hamlin took the matter to&nbsp; the Tax Appeals Court.&nbsp; He contended:&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; he&nbsp; actually&nbsp; paid&nbsp; the tax on September 21 in the afternoon, but pursuant to certain accounting practices, the customs man wrote September 22 on the official receipt; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) in the circumstances&nbsp; he should be&nbsp; charged&nbsp; 15% only—not the 50% effective&nbsp; September 22, 1950.<br><br>The&nbsp; said&nbsp; court&nbsp; refused to believe testimonies of employees presented to contradict the date&nbsp; appearing on&nbsp; the official&nbsp; documents.&nbsp; At any rate it held,&nbsp; "according&nbsp; to Sec. 190 of the Tax Code, the compensating tax&nbsp; is 'to be paid upon withdrawal&nbsp; or removal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the commodities *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * from customs custody/&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the payment&nbsp; to be made should be determined upon such withdrawal&nbsp; or removal.&nbsp; As the removal was actually effected on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1950, the&nbsp; tax should&nbsp; have been paid&nbsp; immediately before such withdrawal and the tax rate of 50% then enforced as of such time would be applied."<br><br>We find no fault with the above reasoning.&nbsp; It is supported by the wording and evident&nbsp; intention&nbsp; of section 190, of the Tax Code, the corresponding portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 190. <span style="font-style: italic;">Compensating Tax</span>.—All&nbsp; persons&nbsp; residing&nbsp; or doing business in the Philippines, who purchase or&nbsp; receive from&nbsp; without the Philippines any commodities, goods, wares, or merchandise, excepting those&nbsp; subject to specific taxes under Title IV of the Code, shall pay on the total value thereof at&nbsp; the time they are received by such persons, including freight,&nbsp; postage, insurance,&nbsp; commission, and all similar charges, a compensating tax.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> to be paid upon the withdrawal or removal of said commodities,</span> good, wares or merchandise <span style="font-style: italic;">from&nbsp; the customhouse</span> or the post office.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *." (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>It is clear from this provision that the tax is to be paid at the time the&nbsp; goods are received, and&nbsp; is to be computed as of the date of withdrawal or removal, because the total value&nbsp; of the merchandise must necessarily&nbsp; include such charges&nbsp; as arrastre, brokerage, warehousing or other expenses incident&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; the delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of tax prevailing on such day has perforce to be applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that this tax takes the place of the sales&nbsp; tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; And ordinarily there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no perfected sale&nbsp; until the&nbsp; delivery (or withdrawal for&nbsp; customs in this case)&nbsp; takes&nbsp; place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note also that this is not an import tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <br><br>Granting, however, that petitioner&nbsp; is right in his proposition&nbsp; that the tax&nbsp; should be computed as of&nbsp; the day he actually&nbsp; paid it,&nbsp; we&nbsp; find&nbsp; no good reason to disturb the factual finding&nbsp; of the Tax Court that payment was actually made on&nbsp; September 22, 1950.&nbsp; The receipt&nbsp; bears that date, and many&nbsp; official steps generally taken <span style="font-style: italic;">before payment</span> of the tax bear the date September 22.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, it takes <span style="font-style: italic;">a&nbsp; very unusual case</span>&nbsp; (not to say unlikely) for employees&nbsp; to remember four or five years after September 22, 1950,&nbsp; that payment had actually been made&nbsp; on the preceeding day.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is more,&nbsp; the first&nbsp; letter addressed to the Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; 5) on behalf of Hamlin regarding this same matter did not question— impliedly admitted—the Customs' statement that payment was made on September 22,&nbsp; 1950.<br><br>The letter reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"GENTLEMEN:<br><br>Our Mr. F. F. Hamlin of Bogo-Madellin Milling Co., Inc., Cebu advises us in a letter dated November 4, 1954 of the following:—<br><br>I imported&nbsp; a Mercury sedan car&nbsp; into&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; which arrived in Manila on&nbsp; September 17,&nbsp; 1950&nbsp; on the S/S&nbsp; President Wilson.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was trans-shipped&nbsp; via&nbsp; the F.S. "Albert" and entered the Port of Cebu for consumption on September&nbsp; 21, 1950. The Bureau of Customs,&nbsp; Cebu put in a telephone call to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, Cebu on September 21, 1954 asking what rate of compensating&nbsp; tax was&nbsp; then&nbsp; in force.&nbsp; The&nbsp; information&nbsp; from the Bureau of Internal Revenue was that 15% was the correct rate.&nbsp; The Bureau of Customs, Cebu now contend&nbsp; that&nbsp; as the actual payment was made on September 22, 1950 the&nbsp; increase to 50% should prevail.&nbsp; This hinges on section 184 of the Internal Revenue Code and a foot note on page number 138."<br><br>For&nbsp; your&nbsp; information,&nbsp; we&nbsp; enclose photostatic&nbsp; copies of&nbsp; the following:—<br><br>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *. <br>(2)&nbsp; Official Receipt No. 160010 dated September 22, 1950&nbsp; in the amount of P927.95. <br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; * *&nbsp; * . <br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *.<br><br>We would be much obliged if your good office would kindly give us your ruling in order that Mr. Hamlin may be guided accordingly in his relations with the Bureau of Customs in Cebu."</blockquote>It will be noted that whereas&nbsp; payment&nbsp; on September 22, 1950 is twice mentioned, the letter&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">never claimed</span>&nbsp; payment on September 21.<br><br>Wherefore, we find no error in the Tax Court's judgment.&nbsp; Affirmed with&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
