				<H3>TAN HOI, PETITIONER  AND  APPELLEE, VS.  REPUBLIC  OF  THE PHILIPPINES,  OPPOSITOR  AND  APPELLANT.

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On  October 4, 1955, one Tan  Hoi filed a  petition for naturalization  with the Court of First Instance  of Manila alleging,  among others, that one of  his children named Tan Nam was born on  October 10, 1949  and was  residing at 117  Burnham St., Hongkong.</p>
<p>On December 28, 1956,  the court, after hearing,  granted the petition ordering that petitioner be admitted as citizen of the  Philippines and that,  upon prior compliance with the provisions of Republic Act No.  530,  and after taking the required oath, a certificate of naturalization be issued to him which  shall be  registered in the civil registry as required  by Act  No.  3753.</p>
<p>On January 17,  1959, upon petitioner's request,  a hearing  was  held  before  the same court preparatory to his oath taking in compliance with the provisions of said Act wherein he declared that during the  two intervening years he had never left the Philippines;  that he had continuously held the position  of manager  of the  Panciteria  Moderna; that he had never been  convicted of any offense or violation of any government promulgated rules;  that  he had filed a statement  of his assets and  liabilities  and  paid his registration fee of P10.00; that he has four children, two with his first  wife and two with  the second; that his eldest child, William Tan, was 21 years and 3 months old, his second Tan  Nam, 9 years old, his third Philip W. Tan, 4 years old, and the fourth Jimmy W. Tan,  1 year  and 8 months old; and that Tan Nam  was living  in Hongkong with his godfather and has never been in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The  Office  of the Solicitor General opposed petitioner's petition to  take the oath of allegiance on the ground that one of  his children, Tan  Nam,  who was already of  school age at  the time of the hearing, was  in Hongkong and had never been  in the Philippines, which indicates that he has, failed to send him to a school recognized by the Office  of Private Education.  And so he has committed an act "prejudicial to  the  interest of  the  nation or contrary to any Government announced policies," as embodied in the Revised Naturalization Law.</p>
<p>Petitioner replied to his opposition with the explanation that his aforementioned son, since the death of his wife  in China,  was placed by him  under  the care and custody  of his godfather who enrolled him in one of the schools  in Hongkong and requested  petitioner's consent to  his  adoption four years before.  Having overruled the opposition  of the government, the trial court on January 28, 1959 issued an order, allowing petitioner to  take the oath of allegiance upon the theory that the question posed  in the opposition is one  which  could  not  be  entertained  at that istage  of the proceedings because,  in its  opinion, the <em>only</em> issue  to be determined is whether petitioner has complied with the requirements  of Republic Act No. 530.</p>
<p>On January 29, 1959,  before  the Office of the Solicitor General  received copy of the order  permitting petitioner to take the oath of allegiance,  petitioner was allowed  to take the oath  by the trial court.  The  government moved for the reconsideration of  the  order as well as for the concellation of  the  oath,  but  the  motion  was  denied. Hence this  appeal.</p>
<p>Section  2, paragraph 6  of the Revised Naturalization Law requires as one of the qualifications of an applicant for  naturalization that  he  must have enrolled his minor children of  school age  in  any of the  public  or  private schools recognized by the Office of Private Education where Philippine history, government and  civics are taught  or prescribed as  part  of the  school curriculum during the entire period of the residence in  the  Philippines required of him prior to the hearing of his petition for naturalization.  The  importance  of  this  requirement  has  been repeatedly emphasized by this Court in a number of cases wherein it was intimated that  such  requirement is mandatory.  Thus, it was held  that the fact that the children of an  applicant when they  left the Philippines for China in 1937 were not yet of school age and  could not be brought back to the Philippines when they were already of school age  due to the civil  war in China, or that the applicant could not finance the return of his minor children to the Philippines in addition to the strictness of the Philippine immigration  authorities, was no  valid  excuse  for non-compliance with this requirement.  (Koe Sengkee  <em>vs</em>. Republic, 90 Phil., 595; Tan Hi <em>vs</em>. Republic, 88 Phil., 117). It was also held that the last world  war was  no reason to dispense  with  the compliance with  such requirement as otherwise  it  would be to establish a  dangerous precedent (Uy Boco  <em>vs</em>. Republic,  85  Phil.,  320; 47 Off. Gaz., 3442, 3445,  3447).  Likewise, a  petition  for  naturalization was  denied where it  was  shown that  one of  the minor children of petitioner Was in China since her infancy and was  never given a  chance to study in the Philippines (Lian Chu  <em>vs</em>. Republic,  87 Phil.,  668; 48 Off.  Gaz., 1780). And since the effect  of naturalization is to extend to the children of the applicant the privilege of citizenship, this Court has emphasized that "It is the  <em>policy</em> of  the Philippine Government to have prospective citizens,  * * * learn and imbibe  the customs, traditions and ideals of the Filipinos as well  as their democratic form of government," as embodied in our Naturalization Law.   (Koe Sengkee <em>vs</em>. Republic, <em>supra</em>; See also Du <em>vs</em>. Republic, 92 Phil., 519.)</p>
<p>Now  there  is no dispute  that  one of the children of petitioner, named Tan Nam, was born in Canton, China on October 10, 1949  and since then has never been in the Philippines which shows that at the time of the hearing of the  petition  for naturalization more than  two years ago he  was already seven years old.   If petitioner  had been  sincere in complying with  the requirement of the law relative to education,  he should have taken  steps to bring his child to the Philippines so that he may be enrolled in a school recognized  by our government.   But this he failed to  do  under the pretext that he was adopted by his godfather, which to us appears flimsy as we will later point  out.  It is true that  this question should  have been raised by the government when the hearing of the naturalization  case came  up  and apparently  it  was  passed up thru an oversight, but we  disagree with the opinion  that it can no  longer be entertained at this  stage of the  proceeding for, as we have already pointed out, the educational requirement of the law is one of the avowed  policies of our government.   And  since  one of the requirements of Republic Act  No.  530  is  that  the  applicant should not commit, during the period of two  years, any  "act  prejudicial to the interest of  the nation or contrary to any Government announced policies"  (Section 1), the inescapable conclusion is that petitioner has  failed to comply with all the  requirements  to entitle  him  to  take the oath of allegiance.</p>
<p>But it is contended that petitioner could not have brought his son Tan Nam to the  Philippines for the reason  that he has  already been  adopted by  his godfather who  was financially  able to  give him education and  support with the logical  result  that his  (petitioner's)   naturalization will not benefit  him (his son) because  under the law he will follow the citizenship  of his adopting father.  In the first  place, there  is no sufficient evidence  to  show  that the  child was in  effect adopted  as  claimed it appearing that the alleged adoption  is  merely  supported  by petitioner's affidavit.   In the  second place, this Court has already held that the rights of a  legitimate child given  to an adopted  child, as stated in Article  341 of our Civil Code, do not  include  the acquisition of the  citizenship  of the adopter (Cheng Ling  <em>vs</em>.  Galang,  L-11931,  October 27, 1958).   Even, therefore, if we assume  that  petitioner's son  has been  adopted  as claimed, the  fact  remains that he would still  retain  the citizenship  of his natural  father with the result  that  he should eventually benefit from it should  his  father  become a naturalized Filipino.   Hence, the  alleged  adoption  cannot justify petitioner's failure  to educate his son Tan Nam as  required by law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed.  We hereby  declare that the oath of allegiance taken by petitioner on January 29, 1959 has no  legal force and  effect. The naturalization  certificate issued  to petitioner, if any, is hereby cancelled.  No costs.</p>
