				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, granting a motion to dismiss.<br><br>The complaint alleges that the spouses&nbsp; Hilarion Martir and Legoria Martir, during their lifetime and&nbsp; up to year 1941, were in the possession and enjoyment of a parcel of public land under fishpond permit issued by the&nbsp; Government, which parcel of land they converted into a fishpond on&nbsp; which bangus was&nbsp; raised; that in his&nbsp; will Hilarion Martir devised said fishpond to Hermogenes Martir, and the will was admitted to probate; that in October, 1940 while Hermogenes&nbsp; Martir was&nbsp; judicial administrator&nbsp; of the estate of his parents, he obtained a loan from the defendants Pedro Trinidad and Carmen Vasquez;&nbsp; that&nbsp; to secure payment of said loan he executed&nbsp; a deed of conditional sale of the fishpond&nbsp; or his&nbsp; rights&nbsp; thereto; that defendants induced the said&nbsp; Hermogenes Martir&nbsp; through deceit, fraud or&nbsp; strategem, to&nbsp; execute the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of conditional sale above mentioned; that said conditional sale was simulated and fictitious and, therefore, null and void. It is further alleged that by reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; such fraud and deceit plaintiffs herein had been caused damages in the amount of P60,000.&nbsp; In the prayer, plaintiffs seek to annul the&nbsp; above-mentioned conditional sale&nbsp; and&nbsp; the return&nbsp; of the fishpond, as well as the payment of damages to them.<br><br>The plaintiffs are minor children of the deceased Hermogenes Martir.&nbsp; From a decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. L-4054-R, entitled "The&nbsp; Government of the Republic of the Philippines and Pedro Trinidad, plaintiffs-appellants, <i>vs.</i> Angela Martir, Antonio Guanzon and Hilario Midez,&nbsp; defendants-appellees," submitted by the defendants in support of their motion to dismiss, it appears that there was a previous litigation for the recovery of the possession of the fishpond, and defendants in this action, plaintiffs in the said case, obtained a decision of the Court of Appeals declaring them entitled to the possession of the fishpond.<br><br>On the basis of the&nbsp; decision of the Court of Appeals, the&nbsp; defendants moved&nbsp; to dismiss, alleging&nbsp; the following grounds:&nbsp; (1) That plaintiffs have no cause of action;&nbsp; (2) That the cause of action, if any, is barred by a prior judgment and by the statute of limitations; and (3) That the action is not brought in the name of the real party&nbsp; in interest.<br><br>The lower court sustained the motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs do not have&nbsp; a cause of&nbsp; action because they&nbsp; are not primarily or subsidiarily liable under the contract; that the action has prescribed because the same should have been filed 4 years from October 1,&nbsp; 1942, but that they filed this case&nbsp; only on June 27, 1957; and&nbsp; that it is also barred by a prior judgment.<br><br>Against the&nbsp; above order&nbsp; of&nbsp; dismissal, plaintiffs have prosecuted this&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>With respect&nbsp; to the first ground upon which the motion to&nbsp; dismiss was sustained,&nbsp; we find that appellants' claim that a cause of action exists or existed in their favor&nbsp; is well taken.&nbsp; Plaintiffs in this action are the children&nbsp; of the late Hermogenes Martir who executed&nbsp; the deed&nbsp; of conditional sale, allegedly&nbsp; obtained by the defendants&nbsp; in a fraudulent manner.&nbsp; As the contract involved is&nbsp; a&nbsp; conditional&nbsp; sale of the rights to the fishpond,&nbsp; the subject&nbsp; of the contract are&nbsp; real rights thereto transmissible&nbsp; to the heirs of the deceased Hermogenes Martir.&nbsp; (Art. 776, old Civil Code).<br><br>Appellants argue&nbsp; also that the judgment&nbsp; rendered by the Court of Appeals is not binding on them.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is also merit in this contention because neither Hermogenes Martir nor his&nbsp; administrator were parties&nbsp; to said&nbsp; action.<br><br>The appellants&nbsp; further&nbsp; argue that the finding of the court below that the action has prescribed is not supported by the facts, for&nbsp; the reason that the plaintiffs herein are still minors&nbsp; and have not yet become of age, so&nbsp; that&nbsp; they can still bring&nbsp; the action.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no merit in this argument.&nbsp; The cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action&nbsp; arose&nbsp; in 1940, when the supposed deed of conditional sale was supposedly secured through fraud&nbsp; and deceit&nbsp; by the defendants&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case at&nbsp; bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of action arose from that date, as there is no allegation that fraud was discovered later.&nbsp; The cause of&nbsp; action accrued&nbsp; not in favor&nbsp; of the minors herein, but in favor of the father who was the person against whom fraud&nbsp; was committed.&nbsp; Their&nbsp; father&nbsp; died&nbsp; in 1943, and upon&nbsp; his death the four year period of filing the action on ground of fraud had not yet expired.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the&nbsp; disability of the plaintiffs can not be&nbsp; tacked to the disability caused by&nbsp; their father's&nbsp; death, because tacking of disabilities is not&nbsp; allowed.<br><blockquote>"Except where the statute&nbsp; otherwise so provides,&nbsp; one disability cannot be tacked to&nbsp; another, nor the disabilities&nbsp; of an ancestor to those of the heir, to protect a party from the operation of the statute; nor can a party avail himself of several disabilities, unless they all existed at the time when the right of action accrued&nbsp; * * * This is an obedience to the universal rule, before stated, that when the statute once begins&nbsp; to run no subsequent disability can stop&nbsp; its operation, unless&nbsp; specially so provided in the statute."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Wood on Limitations, 3d edition, pp.&nbsp; 554-557).<br><br>'Disability cannot be added to disability.&nbsp; If that were permitted a right might travel through minorities for an indefinite timeâ€”for two centuries, Lord Eldon said.&nbsp; Demarest m Wynkoop, 3 Johns, Ch., 129,&nbsp; 139; 8 Am. Dec., 467/&nbsp; (Messinger <i>vs.</i> Foster, 101 N.Y. Supp. 387.)"<br><br>"* *&nbsp; *&nbsp; The&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; stated is&nbsp; in complete harmony with the Civil Law on the&nbsp; subject;&nbsp; the heir or successor acquires the rights of the predecessor&nbsp; and no more.&nbsp; 'The heir represents the person of the deceased, and both are even considered as one same person: <i>haeres censetur, cum defuncto una eademque persona;</i> 'according to law,' says law 13, tit. 9, Part 7, 'the person of the heir and that of him from whom he inherits is considered as one.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (Escriche's Dictionary, title 'Heredere'".<br><br>"* * * The following are general rules as to successors: He who succeeds to the right or property of another must use the same right as he: <i>qui in jus dominumve alterius&nbsp; succedit, jure ejus&nbsp; uti debet.</i> The successor cannot be in a better condition than&nbsp; big predecessor: <i>non debeo meliores esse&nbsp; conditions quam auctor neus, a quo jus ad ge&nbsp; transit.</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ibid.,&nbsp; title&nbsp; "Successor.")&nbsp; (Quijano and&nbsp; Heirs&nbsp; of Francis <i>vs.</i> Gomez Cabale, pp. 49 Phil.,&nbsp; 367).<br></blockquote>Upon their father's death,&nbsp; his administrator or his heirs had the right&nbsp; to continue the action,&nbsp; which&nbsp; has already started&nbsp; to&nbsp; accrue, for the remaining period,&nbsp; which is only one year more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of filing the action within&nbsp; that remaining period of time, the heirs brought the same only after 13&nbsp; years from&nbsp; the time&nbsp; the right to bring it had expired.<br><br>The order of dismissal is hereby affirmed, on the ground of the limitation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; action,&nbsp; with costs against&nbsp; the appellants.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
