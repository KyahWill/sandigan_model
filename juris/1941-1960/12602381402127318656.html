				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order of the Court of Appeals, Fourth Division, in CA-G. R. No. 15444-R, promulgated September 5,&nbsp; 1956, finding Leonardo&nbsp; Azarcon,&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Azarcon and Esteban Abobo guilty of contempt of court,&nbsp; ordering each of them to pay&nbsp; a fine&nbsp; of P100,&nbsp; to remove certain improvements that&nbsp; they&nbsp; have&nbsp; constructed&nbsp; on the land, etc.<br><br>The&nbsp; record discloses that respondent Victor Eusebio and petitioners herein had a dispute over the possession of a certain parcel of&nbsp; public&nbsp; land in the year&nbsp; 1954. Victor Eusebio had filed&nbsp; a lease&nbsp; application, No. V-79, for&nbsp; a parcel&nbsp; of land known as lot No. 3807, containing an area of about 349 hectares.&nbsp; A portion thereof was occupied by petitioners&nbsp; herein,&nbsp;&nbsp; Leonardo L.&nbsp; Azarcon&nbsp; and&nbsp; his&nbsp; companions,&nbsp; under&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; homestead&nbsp; application.&nbsp; The&nbsp; conflict between the lessee and the homesteaders was ordered to be investigated on May 25, 1955 by the Director&nbsp; of Lands and again on August 3,&nbsp; 1955 by the Secretary,&nbsp; of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<br><br>Before the dispute could be settled and on April&nbsp; 28, 1954, Victor Eusebio filed a complaint in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Nueva Ecija, alleging that he had acquired a big parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land,&nbsp; 349 hectares in area, by lease from the Bureau of Lands (lease application No. V-79); that while he was in possession thereof defendants occupied a portion, known as lot No. 2807, containing an area of six hectares more&nbsp; or less.&nbsp; He,&nbsp; therefore, prayed that defendants be ordered to vacate the six hectares occupied by them and&nbsp; pay damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant Leonardo Azarcon answered the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complaint alleging that&nbsp; he is in actual possession of&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion of 24 hectares since 1941 by virtue of&nbsp; a homestead&nbsp;&nbsp; application, No. V-42995;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease application of&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; is&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; to said homestead application of&nbsp; Leonardo&nbsp; Azarcon; that Azarcon had&nbsp; occupied the&nbsp; land&nbsp; since&nbsp; 1941 with interruptions&nbsp; during the war&nbsp; and again in 1950 up to the time of the filing of the&nbsp; action.&nbsp;&nbsp; He, therefore,&nbsp; prayed that&nbsp; the&nbsp; action&nbsp; be&nbsp; dismissed.&nbsp; The answer was filed on June 2, 1954 and on motion of plaintiffs&nbsp; dated March&nbsp; 15, 1955,&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; declared in default.&nbsp; A motion to set aside the default&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied,&nbsp; and a judgment by&nbsp; default was entered by the court on April&nbsp; 26, 1955.&nbsp; It ordered defendants to restore&nbsp; possession of the land to&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having failed&nbsp; to obtain&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; reconsideration of the above decision, defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals. <br><br>While the case was pending in the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; a writ for the execution of the judgment&nbsp; of the lower court was issued on October 3, 1955.&nbsp; On October&nbsp; 8, 1955, defendants&nbsp; moved and&nbsp; the court on October 21 ordered that the said writ of execution be&nbsp; stayed upon defendants' depositing of&nbsp; a&nbsp; supersedeas bond of Pl,000.&nbsp; The writ of execution was&nbsp; actually served on the defendants on October 7, 1955.&nbsp; Various petitions were submitted by the parties, and among them was that of defendants-appellants&nbsp; asking for the lifting of the writ of execution.&nbsp; This petition, dated&nbsp; October&nbsp; 14, 1955, was granted on November 1, 1955,&nbsp; and the court&nbsp; again fixed the supersedeas bond to&nbsp; stay execution in the amount&nbsp; of P1,000 to&nbsp; be filed with and approved by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija as to&nbsp; its sufficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same order of November 7, the Court of&nbsp; Appeals denied&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; of the plaintif-fappellee to file a counter-supersedeas bond as well as plaintiff appellee's motion&nbsp; for injunction.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the defendants-appellants had presented on November 21, 1955 the supersedeas bond required for the approval&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija and the said bond was filed and approved on November 21, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fact was certified&nbsp; to&nbsp; by the clerk of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija on November 14, 1955.<br><br>On December 2, 1955 the&nbsp; Court of Appeals on motion of plaintiff,&nbsp; reconsidered its order or resolution of November 7, 1955 authorizing the stay of execution upon&nbsp; the filing of the&nbsp; bond by the defendants-appellants, on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that the defendants-appellants have not filed any supersedeas&nbsp; bond as required.&nbsp; On January 19, 1956,&nbsp; the Court of Appeals denied a petition of defendants-appellants to reconsider said order of December 2, 1955 on the ground that the writ&nbsp; of execution&nbsp; issued on October&nbsp; 3, 1955 had already been&nbsp; executed.<br><br>The following appear to be clear: (a) the writ of execution dated October 3, 1955 was furnished&nbsp; the defendants on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1955; (6) said order of execution was set aside in an order of October 21, 1955, which order authorized the defendants-appellants&nbsp; to file a supersedeas bond in the amount of P1,000, the same to be approved by&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija; (c) said supersedeas bond was filed with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance on November 21,&nbsp; 1955, but the certificate showing such filing of the bond&nbsp; was issued by the&nbsp; clerk of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Nueva Ecija only on December 14, 1955; and the Court of Appeals, not having been notified of the fact that the defendants have already secured the approval of their supersedeas bond, set aside the order to stay execution on December 2, 1955.<br><br>The evidence shows that in&nbsp; spite&nbsp; of the receipt by&nbsp; the defendants of the notice of the writ of execution of October 3, 1955, which writ of execution commanded defendants "to forthwith <i>remove&nbsp; from said premises</i>&nbsp; and that plaintiff have restitution of the same," defendants-appellants nevertheless entered the land to gather palay which was then pending harvest.&nbsp; We gather further from the record that the rice found on the disputed land at the time of the service of the order of execution had been planted by defendants-appellants, who&nbsp; appear to have been in possession of&nbsp; the land from 1951.&nbsp; While the court order of October 3, 1955&nbsp; ordered the defendant-appellant to move out from the premises,&nbsp; it did not&nbsp; prohibit them from gathering the crop&nbsp;&nbsp; then existing thereon.&nbsp; Under the law a person who is in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possession&nbsp; and who is&nbsp; being ordered to leave a parcel of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land while products thereon are pending harvest, has&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; right to a part of the net harvest, as expressly provided by&nbsp; Article 545 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; <br><blockquote>"Art. 545. If at the time the&nbsp; good faith ceases, there should be any natural&nbsp; or industrial fruits, the possessor&nbsp; shall have a right to a part&nbsp; of the expenses of cultivation, and to a part of the net harvest, both in proportion to the time&nbsp; of the possession."<br><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">*******&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></div><br>As the order of execution did&nbsp; not expressly prohibit the defendants-appellants from&nbsp; gathering the pending&nbsp; fruits, which&nbsp; fruits were the&nbsp; result of their possession and cultivation of the land, it&nbsp; cannot be said that the defendants appellants&nbsp; committed an act which is a clear violation of the courts'&nbsp; order.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants-appellants&nbsp; had&nbsp;&nbsp; presented, after receipt of the&nbsp; order of execution, a motion&nbsp; to set aside the said order of execution, and this motion to stay execution was granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants furthermore presented a bond in accordance with the order of the court&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; had it approved by the Court of First&nbsp; Instance.&nbsp; It was perhaps in expectation of this resolution of the court&nbsp; setting aside the order of execution that defendants-appellants&nbsp; may have felt justified&nbsp; in entering the land and harvesting&nbsp; the fruits existing thereon.<br><br>Again the order of the court&nbsp; setting&nbsp; aside its order to stay execution was issued in the belief that the defendants-appellants&nbsp; had not presented their bond to stay execution (which they had actually presented before the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija and which said court actually approved).&nbsp; Under the circumstances above&nbsp; stated, we are not ready to conclude that the&nbsp; defendants-appellants can be held to have committed a clear defiance of the order of the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their act in harvesting the pending fruits was not only justified by law but was not expressly prohibited by the court's order,&nbsp; and was even ratified when the&nbsp; court ordered the suspension of the execution.&nbsp; There was, therefore,&nbsp; no open, clear and contumacious refusal to obey a definite order of the&nbsp; court such as&nbsp; would constitute contempt.&nbsp; Furthermore, a&nbsp; person who has been ordered to leave certain premises&nbsp; is ordinarily not prohibited from taking&nbsp; with him his own effects and possession,&nbsp; unless there is an express prohibition to&nbsp; this&nbsp; effect.&nbsp; No&nbsp; such prohibition was contained in the order for the defendants to leave the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; There may have been a technical violation of an order not to enter the&nbsp; premises,&nbsp; but not of one prohibiting them&nbsp; from removing anything therefrom. Such&nbsp; technical violation of the order cannot be considered as one amounting&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp; defiance of&nbsp; the court's authority, punishable as contempt.<br><br>For the foregoing considerations,&nbsp; the order appealed from should be, as it&nbsp; is hereby, set aside, and the defendants-appellants&nbsp; acquitted of&nbsp; the&nbsp; charge against&nbsp; them. Without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion</i>, and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
