salaries of Felix Go Chan and Teotimo Tiu Tiam at P250.00 each, and the

  </blockquote>
  <p>
Passing upon said issue, which is, also, the only one raised in this
appeal, the lower court held that "representation * * * expenses fall
under the category of business expenses which" are allowable deductions
from gross income if they meet the conditions prescribed by law",
particularly section 30 (a) (1) of the National Internal Revenue Code;
that, to be deductible, said business expenses must be "ordinary and
necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or
business"; that those expenses "must also, meet the further test of
reasonableness in amount", this test being "inherent in the phase
'ordinary and necessary' "; that <i>some</i> of the representation
expenses claimed by appellant had been evidenced by vouchers or chits,
but others were reimbursed "without presentation of supporting papers;
that the aforementioned vouchers or chits were allegedly "destroyed
when the house of Buenaventura M. Veloso, treasurer of appellant, where
the records were kept was burned"; that, accordingly, "it is not
possible to determine the actual amount covered by supporting papers
and the amount without supporting papers"; that the court should,
therefore, "determine from all available data the amount properly
deductible as representation expenses"; that "during the period of four
(4) years from 1949 to 1952, appellant had gross income, net profits
and claimed representation expenses as follows:</p>

  <p>and
that "from the above figures, we may infer that the sum of P10,000 may
be considered reasonably necessary for entertainment expenses of
appellant in 1951, it having claimed a little over the amount in 1950,
when its gross income was more than its gross income in 1951 and 1952",
and because "it allegedly spent for entertainment purposes in 1948 the
sum of P500.00 only." Hence, the lower court modified the assessment of
the taxes due from appellant herein the manner set forth in the
beginning of this decision.</p>
  <p> In its brief, appellant does not
assail any of the premises upon which the aforementioned conclusion of
the lower court was predicated. What is more, it relied upon, and,
even, quoted some of the views expressed in the decision appealed from.
Appellant, however, maintains that said court had acted arbitrarily in
considering the representation expenses in 1950, not those incurred in
1949 and 1952, in fixing the amount deductible in 1951. This pretense
is clearly untenable. It appears: (a) that part of the alleged
representation expenses had never had any supporting paper; (b) that
the vouchers and chits covering other representation expenses had been
allegedly destroyed; (c) that there is no documentary evidence on
record of any of the representation expenses in question; (d) that no
testimonial evidence has been introduced on any specific item of said
alleged expenses; (e) that there is no more than oral proof to the
effect that payments had been made to appellant's officers for
representation expenses allegedly made by the latter and about the
general nature of such alleged expenses; (f) that the gross income in
1950 exceeded the gross income in 1951 and 1952, and (g) that the
representation expenses in 1948 amounted to P500 only. Under these
circumstances, the lower court was fully justified in concluding that
the representation expenses in 1951 should be slightly less than those
incurred in 1950.</p>
  <p> Upon the other hand, appellant has not
even tried to show why its representation expenses in 1951 should be
deemed bigger than the amount allowed by the lower court. In fact, the
latter had been patently fair and reasonable, if not rather liberal, in
allowing appellant to deduct P10,000.00 as representation expenses for
1951, there being absolutely no concrete evidence of the sums then
actually spent for purposes of representation. It may not be amiss to
note that the explanation to the effect that the supporting paper of
some of those expenses had been destroyed when the house of the
treasurer was burned, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory, for
appellant's records are supposed to be kept in its offices, not in the
residence of one of its officers.</p>
  <p> Being in accordance with
the facts and the law, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed,
with costs against petitioner-appellant, Visayan Cebu Terminal Co.,
Inc. It is so ordered.</p>
