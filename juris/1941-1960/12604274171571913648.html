				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Plaintiffs brought this action in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal for&nbsp; the annulment of a certain document whereby&nbsp; Juana Fariñas Vda. de Baclig released in favor of defendant a portion of public agricultural land which was the subject of a sales&nbsp; application then pending consideration by the Bureau of Lands.<br><br>Plaintiffs are the heirs of one&nbsp; Eustaquio&nbsp; Baclig,&nbsp; Sr., who died in 1944.&nbsp; They alleged that in 1932 Baclig filed a sales application&nbsp; to buy a parcel&nbsp; of public&nbsp; agricultural land&nbsp; situated in Kiañgan,&nbsp; Mt.&nbsp; Province; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1934 Baclig placed defendant as his overseer&nbsp; to take&nbsp; care of the cultivation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; having acted&nbsp; as&nbsp; such continuously up to June, 1956; that on November 4, 1954, after the death&nbsp; of Baclig, defendant requested his widow to be allowed to apply with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Lands for a&nbsp; free patent of a portion of&nbsp; the land covered&nbsp; by their sales application containing&nbsp; an area of 30 hectares to which the widow, moved by his appeal was prevailed upon to agree provided&nbsp; that the&nbsp; portion&nbsp; to be released be taken&nbsp; from the uncultivated part of the land,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; that effect she executed the&nbsp; deed of release Annex A on November 4, 1954; that sometime in 1956, the widow sent a representative to visit the land which&nbsp; was under the supervision of defendant&nbsp; and it was only then that she&nbsp; discovered&nbsp; that the portion of land described in the deed of release was the cultivated portion&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; the agreement and representations made by defendant;&nbsp; and that defendant, acting in bad&nbsp; faith,&nbsp; has caused his&nbsp; wife and daughter&nbsp; to&nbsp; file free patent applications for the parcel of land covered by the deed of release&nbsp; which are now causing delay&nbsp; in&nbsp; the approval of the sales application of plaintiffs because of the conflict occasioned by the aforesaid&nbsp; free patent applications.<br><br>Defendant,&nbsp; in his&nbsp; answer, admitted&nbsp; that he acted as overseer of plaintiffs and their predecessor in interest in the land covered&nbsp; by their&nbsp; sales&nbsp; application,&nbsp; but denied that the deed&nbsp; of release Annex&nbsp; A has&nbsp; been&nbsp; executed by the widow through false representation on his part.&nbsp;&nbsp; He averred that said&nbsp; deed was executed by&nbsp; her&nbsp; because of their agreement to transfer to him&nbsp; a portion of the land covered by their application in consideration&nbsp; of the sum of P1,000.00 which was actually received by her in Manila sometime in 1954,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; if such consideration does&nbsp; not appear in the&nbsp; deed, it was due to fraud&nbsp; committed by&nbsp; the widow.&nbsp; Defendant also set up a counterclaim for damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>When the case&nbsp; was called&nbsp; for trial,&nbsp; defendant moved for the&nbsp; dismissal of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint on the ground that it does not state&nbsp; a cause of action,&nbsp; whereupon the court allowed&nbsp; defendant to&nbsp; submit evidence in support&nbsp; thereof.<br><br>At this juncture, plaintiffs&nbsp; admitted that the portion of land covered by the deed of release sought to be annulled is&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the public agricultural land&nbsp; covered by their sales application pending in the&nbsp; Bureau of Lands&nbsp; which was then under consideration.&nbsp; In view of this admission, defendant desisted from&nbsp; presenting&nbsp; further evidence&nbsp; and submitted his motion for&nbsp; resolution.&nbsp; Thereupon, the court issued an order sustaining the&nbsp; motion and dismissing the complaint.&nbsp; Hence the present appeal.<br><br>The reasons given by the trial&nbsp; court in dismissing the complaint&nbsp; are&nbsp; as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"The only question to be determined in this case is whether the plaintiffs,&nbsp; under the above facts&nbsp; stipulated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; can maintain&nbsp; a&nbsp; separate and&nbsp; simultaneous&nbsp; action in&nbsp; Court against the herein defendant in whose favor was executed the deed of release to the portion of public land before the Bureau of&nbsp; Lands which was likewise applied with Free Patent Applications of the defendant's representatives,&nbsp; now&nbsp; pending action&nbsp; and approval&nbsp; by said&nbsp; office.<br><br>"In this connection,&nbsp; it may not&nbsp; be&nbsp; amiss&nbsp; to state&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands is a quasi-judicial tribunal having exclusive&nbsp; jurisdiction over the disposition of public&nbsp; domain and&nbsp; charged with the administration of all laws relative thereto.&nbsp; It&nbsp; appearing that the Bureau of Lands has taken cognizance of the case,&nbsp; the determination of which&nbsp; depends the present&nbsp; action, the&nbsp; Court believes that it cannot divest of&nbsp; it&nbsp; until after&nbsp; exhausting the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of its authority."<br></blockquote><br>It&nbsp; would&nbsp; appear that the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; considered&nbsp; itself without&nbsp; jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case for the only&nbsp; reason that the portion&nbsp; of&nbsp; land covered by the&nbsp; deed of release which&nbsp; is&nbsp; sought to be annulled is part&nbsp; of a public agricultural land covered&nbsp; by&nbsp; sales application filed by plaintiffs as well as by the free patent application filed by defendant with the Bureau of Lands which were&nbsp; then pending consideration by said office.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court reasoned out that because&nbsp; said Bureau has&nbsp; exclusive&nbsp; jurisdiction over&nbsp; disposition&nbsp; of public lands, the&nbsp; conflict&nbsp; can&nbsp; not be passed upon by the trial court without the&nbsp; parties having first&nbsp; exhausted their administrative remedies,&nbsp; or&nbsp; without said conflict having first been determined by&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands.<br><br>We believe&nbsp; this&nbsp; to be an error.&nbsp;&nbsp; While&nbsp; it is true that the Bureau&nbsp; of Lands has exclusive jurisdiction to act on matters&nbsp; which concern the sale,&nbsp; lease&nbsp; or&nbsp; other disposition of public&nbsp; lands, and that any conflict that may arise in relation&nbsp; thereto comes&nbsp; under its authority, the question herein involved is one that comes under the jurisdiction of the regular courts, for&nbsp; it merely concerns&nbsp; the annulment of a&nbsp; private contract even if it covers&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion of the public domain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears that plaintiffs&nbsp; applied for a sales application of a large tract of public agricultural land&nbsp; with the Bureau of Lands, and while the same was pending consideration,&nbsp; an&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; was&nbsp; entered into between Juana Fariñas&nbsp; widow of Baclig and defendant whereby the latter was allowed to apply for himself a portion thereof containing an area of 30 hectares.&nbsp; On the strength of this&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; defendant was able to&nbsp; file with the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Lands in&nbsp; behalf of&nbsp; his wife&nbsp; and daughter a free patent application covering that&nbsp; portion which during the&nbsp; pendency of this case was&nbsp; also under the consideration of said Bureau.&nbsp; It developed however that the agreement was entered into&nbsp; through&nbsp; fraud&nbsp; and misrepresentation&nbsp; on the part of&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; as claimed in the complaint, for which reason the present action was instituted.&nbsp; As a consequence, the widow wants&nbsp; now to annul the&nbsp; agreement in&nbsp; order&nbsp; that the free patent application submitted by defendant in behalf of his wife&nbsp; and daughter will not be given due course.&nbsp; This gave rise to a conflict&nbsp; between the sales application of the widow on one hand,&nbsp; and the free patent application of the defendant, on the&nbsp; other.&nbsp; It therefore&nbsp; becomes necessary&nbsp; to first determine the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; resolve that conflict.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; not the concern of the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; This comes&nbsp; within the&nbsp; province&nbsp; of the&nbsp; regular courts.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is set aside.&nbsp; The case is remanded to&nbsp; the lower court for further proceedings.&nbsp; Costs against&nbsp; appellee.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
