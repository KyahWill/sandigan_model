				G.R. No. L-856, April 18, 1949</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SUSANO PEREZ (ALIAS KID PEREZ), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Susano Perez <i>alias</i> Kid Perez was convicted of treason by 
the 5th Division of the People's Court sitting in Cebu City and sentenced, to 
death by electrocution.
<p align="justify">Seven counts were alleged in the information but the 
prosecution offered evidence only on counts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, all of which, 
according to the court, were substantiated. In a unanimous decision, the trial 
court found as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"As regards count No. 1—</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Count No. 1 alleges that the accused, together with the other 
filipinos, recruited, apprehended and commandeered numerous girls and women 
against their will for the purpose of using them, as in fact they were used, to 
satisfy the immoral purpose and sexual desire of Colonel Mini, and among such 
unfortunate victims, were Felina Laput, Eriberta Ramo <i>alias</i> Miami Ramo, 
Eduarda Daohog, Eutiquia Lamay, Feliciana Bonalos and Flaviana Bonalos.</p>
<p align="justify">"It would be unnecessary to recite here the testimonies of all 
the victims of the accused; it is sufficient to reproduce here succinctly the 
testimony of Eriberta Ramo. She testified that on June 15, 1942, the accused 
came to her house to get her and told her that she was wanted in the house of 
her aunt, but instead, she was brought to the house of the Puppet Governor 
Agapito Hontañosas; that she escaped and returned to Baclayon her hometown; that 
the accused came again and told her that Colonel Mini wanted her to be his 
Information Clerk; that she did not accept the job; that a week later, the 
accused came to Baclayon to get her, and succeeded in taking some other girls to 
Puppet Governor Agapito Hontañosas; that Governor Hontañosas told her that 
Colonel Mini wanted her to be his wife; that when she was brought to Colonel 
Mini the flatter had nothing on but a "G" string; that he, Colonel Mini 
threatened her with a sword, tied her to a bed and with force succeeded in 
having carnal knowledge with her; that on the following night, again she was 
brought to Colonel Mini and again she was raped; that finally she was able to 
escape and stayed in hiding for three weeks and only came out from the hiding 
when Colonel Mini left Tagbilaran.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"As regards count No. 2— </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Count No. 2 of the information substantially alleges: That the 
accused in company with some Japs and Filipinos took Eriberta Ramo and her 
sister Cleopatra Ramo from their home in Baclayon to attend a banquet and a 
dance organized in honor of Colonel Mini by the Puppet Governor, Agapito 
Hontañosas in order that said Japanese Colonel might select those girls who 
would latter be taken to satisfy his carnal appetite and that by means of 
threat, force and intimidation, the above mentioned two sisters were brought to 
the headquarters of the Japanese Commander at the Mission Hospital in Tagbilaran 
where Eriberta Ramo was forced to live a life of shame. All these facts alleged 
in count No. 2 were testified to by said witnesses Eriberta Ramo and her mother 
Mercedes de Ramo. It is not necessary here to recite once more their testimony 
in support of the allegations in count No. 2; this Court is fully convinced that 
the allegations in said count No. 2 were fully substantiated by the evidence 
adduced.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"As regards count No. 4— </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Count No. 4 substantially alleges that on July 16, 1942, the 
two girls named Eduarda S. Daohog and Eutiquia Lamay, were taken from their 
homes in Corella, Bohol, by the accused and his companion named Vicente 
Bullecer, and delivered to the Japanese Officer, Dr. Takibayas to satisfy his 
carnal appetite, but these two, the accused Susano Perez and his companion 
Vicente Bullecer, before delivering them to said Japanese Officer, satisfied 
first their lust; the accused Susano Perez raping Eduardo S. Daohog, and his 
companion, Vicente Bullecer, the other girl Eutiquia Lamay. Eduarda S. Daohog, 
testifying, said: that while on the way to Tagbilaran, the accused through force 
and intimidation, raped her in an uninhabited house; that she resisted with all 
her force against the desire of the accused, but of no avail; that upon arriving 
in Tagbilaran, she was delivered to the Japanese Officer named Takibayas who 
also raped her. Eutiquia Lamay testified that on July 16, 1942, the accused and 
his companion, Bullecer, went to her house! to take her and her sister; that her 
sister was then out of the house; that the accused threatened her with a 
revolver if she refuses to go; that she was placed in a car where Eduarda Daohog 
was; that while they were in the car, the accused carried Eduarda out of the 
car, and their companion Bullecer took the other witness (Eutiquia Lamay); that 
when the accused and Eduarda returned to the car, the latter, Eduarda, covered 
her face, crying; that later, she and Eduarda were taken to the Governor's 
house; that on arriving and in the presence of the Puppet Governor Hontañosas, 
the Governor exclaimed: "I did not call for these girls"; but the accused 
replied sayings "These girls talked bad against the Japs, and that is why we 
arrested, them"; that the said Governor Hontañosas then, saids "Take them to the 
Japs"; that the accused and Bullecer brought the two girls to the Japanese 
headquarters; that Eduarda Was taken to one room by the Japanese Captain called 
Dr. Takibayas, and she (Eutiquia Lamay) was taken to another room by another 
Japanese, living in that house; that she was raped by that Jap while in the 
room; that she resisted all she could, but of no avail.</p>
<p align="justify">"In the light of the testimonies of these two witnesses, 
Eduarda S. Daohog and Eutiquia Lamay, all the allegations in Count No. 4 were 
fully proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"As regards count No. 5— </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Count No. 5 alleges: That on or about June 4, 1942, the said 
adcused commandeered Feliciana Bonalos and her sister Flaviana Bonalos on the 
pretext that they were to be taken as witnesses before a Japanese Colonel in the 
investigation of a case against a certain Chinese (Insik Eping), and upon 
arriving at Tagbilaran, Bohol, the accused brought the aforesaid two girls to 
the residence of Colonel Mini, Commander of the Japanese Armed Forces in Bohol 
and by means of violences threat and intimidation, said Japanese Colonel abused 
and had sexual intercourse with Flaviana "Bonalos; that the accused subsequently 
brought Flaviana Bonalos to a small house near the headquarters of Colonel Mini 
and through violence, threat and intimidation, succeeded in having carnal 
knowledge with her against her will; that about two days, later, upon the 
pretext of conducting the unfortunate girls to their horns, the said accused 
brought the other girl Feliciana Bonalos to a secluded place in Tagbilaran, 
Bohol, and in the darkness, by means of threat and violence had carnal knowledge 
with her against her will.</p>
<p align="justify">"Feliciana Bonalos testifying in this count, declared that the 
accused came to get her on the pretext that she was to be used as witness in a 
case affecting certain Chinaman before Colonel Mini; that she and her younger 
sister Flaviana were brought in a car driven by the accused; that they were 
brought to the house of Colonel Mini; that her sister Flaviana was conducted 
into a room and after remaining in the same for about an hour, she came out with 
her hair and her dress in disorder; that Flaviana told her immediately that she 
was raped against her will by Colonel Mini; that she (Feliciana), after leaving 
the residence of said Japs officer, was taken by Perez to an uninhabited house 
and there by threat and intimidation the accused succeeded in raping her; that 
when she returned to her (the witness), Flaviana was crying; that the following 
day while conducting the two girls back to their hometown, she (Feliciana) was 
also raped by the accused in an uninhabited house, against her will.</p>
<p align="justify">"Victoriana Arayan (mother of Feliciana and Flaviana Bonalos) 
testified as follows: That on June 15, 1942, the accused came and told her that 
the Japs needed her daughters to be witnesses; that accordingly, her daughters, 
under that understanding, started for Tagbilaran; that later, she went to 
Tagbilaran to look for her daughters and she found them in the office of the 
Puppet Governor; that on seeing her, both daughters wept and told her that they 
were turned, over to the Japs and raped them; that her daughter Flaviana told 
her (the witness) that after the Japs had raped her the accused also raped her 
(Flaviana) in an uninhabited house; that the accused did not permit her two 
daughters to return home on the pretext that the Puppet Governor was then absent 
and in the mean while they stayed in the house of the accused Perez; that when 
her daughters returned to her house ultimately, they related to her (mother) 
what happened; that both daughters told her they would have referred death 
rather than to have gone to Tagbilaran; that Feliciana told her (the mother) 
that the accused had raped her.</p>
<p align="justify">"The information given by Feliciana to her mother is admitted 
in evidence as a part of the <i>res gestae</i> regardless of the time that had 
elapsed between the occurrence and the time of the information. In the manner 
these two witnesses testified in Court, there could be no doubt that they were 
telling the absolute truth. It is hard to conceive that these girls would assume 
and admit the ignominy they have gone through if they we're not true. The Court 
is fully convinced that all the allegations contained in Count No. 5 have been 
iproven by the testimonies of these two witnesses beyond reasonable 
doubt.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"As regards count No. 6—</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Count No. 6, alleges: That the accused, together with his 
Filipino companions, apprehended Natividad Barcinas, Nicanora Ralameda and 
Teotima Barcinas, nurses of the Provincial Hospital, for not having attended a 
dance and reception organized by the Puppet Governor in honor of Colonel Mini 
and other Japs High ranking officers, which was held in Tagbilaran market on 
June 25, 1942; that upon being brought before the Puppet Governor, they were 
severely reprimanded by the latter; that on July 8, 1942, again said nurses were 
forced to attend another banquet and dance in order that the Jap officers Mini 
and Takibayas might make a selection which girl would suit best their fancy; 
that the real purpose behind those forcible invitations was to lure them to the 
residence of said Japanese Officer Mini for immoral purposes.</p>
<p align="justify">"Natividad Barcinas, a Lieutenant of the P. A., testified at 
length. She declared: That on June 29, 1942, she and companion nurses, saw the 
accused coming to the hospital with a revolver and took them on a car to the 
Office of the Puppet Governor where they were severely reprimanded by the latter 
for not attending the dance held on June 25, 1942; that the real purpose in 
compelling them to attend said dances and receptions was to select from among 
them the best girl that would suit the fancy of Colonel Mini for immoral 
purposes; that she and her companions were always afraid of the accused Perez 
whenever he came to said Hospital; that on one occasion, one of the nurses on 
perceiving the approach of the accused, ran up into her room, laid down on her 
bed and simulated to be sick; that said accused not satisfied, went up into the 
room of that particular nurse and pulled out the blanket which covered her and 
telling her that it was only her pretext that she was sick.</p>
<p align="justify">"The testimony of Lt. Natividad Barcinas is fully corroborated 
by that of Nicanora Ralameda. Said testimony need not be reproduced 
here."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In a carefully written brief for the appellant, these findings 
are not questioned, but it is contended that the deeds committed by the accused 
do not constitute treason. The Solicitor General submits the opposite view, and 
argues that "to maintain and preserve the morale of the soldiers has always 
been, and will always be, a fundamental concern of army authorities, for the 
efficiency of an army rests not only on its physical attributes but also, 
mainly, on the morale of its soldiers" (citing the annual report of the Chief of 
Staff, United States Army, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933).</p>
<p align="justify">If furnishing women for immoral purposes to the enemies was 
treason because women's company kept up their morale, so fraternizing with them, 
entertaining them at parties, selling them food and drinks, and kindred acts, 
would be treason. For any act of hospitality without doubt produces the same 
general result. Yet by common agreement those and similar manifestations of 
sympathy and attachment are not the kind of disloyalty that are punished as 
treason.</p>
<p align="justify">In a broad sense, the law of treason, does not proscribe all 
kinds of social, business and political intercourse between the belligerent 
occupants of the invaded country and its inhabitants. In the nature of things, 
the occupation of a country by the enemy is bound to create relations of all 
sorts between the invaders and the natives. What aid and comfort constitute 
treason must depend upon their nature; degree and purpose. To draw a line 
between treasonable and unreasonable assistance is not always easy. The scope of 
adherence to the enemy is comprehensive, its requirement indeterminate, as was 
said in Cramer vs. U.S., 89 Law. ed., 1441. </p>
<p align="justify">As a general rule, to be treasonous the extent of the aid and 
comfort given to the enemies must be to render assistance to them as enemies and 
not merely as individuals, and, in addition, be directly in furtherance of the 
enemies' hostile designs. To make a simple distinction: To lend or give money to 
an enemy as a friend or out of charity to the beneficiary so that he may buy 
personal necessities is to assist him as an individual and is not technically 
traitorious. On the other hand, to lend or give him money to enable him to buy 
arms or ammunition to use in waging war against the giver's country enhances his 
strength and by the same count injures the interest of the government of the 
giver. That is treason. (<i>See</i> U.S. vs. Fricke, 259 F., 673; 63 C. J., 
816, 817.)</p>
<p align="justify">Applying these principles to the case at bar, appellant's first 
assignment of error is correct. His "commandeering" of women to satisfy the lust 
of Japanese officers or men or to enliven the entertainments held in their honor 
was not treason even though the women and the entertainments helped to make life 
more pleasant for the enemies and boost their spirit; he was not guilty any more 
than the women themselves would have been if they voluntarily and willingly had 
surrendered their bodies or organized the entertainments. Sexual and social 
relations with the Japanese did not directly and materially tend to improve 
their war efforts or to weaken the power of the United States. The acts herein 
charged were not, by fair implication, calculated to strenghten the Japanese 
Empire or its army or to cripple the defense and resistance of the other side. 
Whatever favorable effect the defendant's collaboration with the Japanese might 
have in their prosecution of the war was trivial, imperceptible, and 
unintentional. Intent of disloyalty is a vital ingredient in the crime of 
treason, which, in the absence of admission, may be gathered from the nature and 
circumstances of each particular case.</p>
<p align="justify">But the accused may be punished for the rape of Eriberta Ramo, 
Eduarda Daohog, Eutiquia Lamay and Flaviana Bonalos as principal by direct 
participation. Without his cooperation in the manner above stated, these rapes 
could not have been committed.</p>
<p align="justify">Conviction of the accused of rapes instead of treason finds 
express sanction in section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 682, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<i>Provided further</i>, That where, in its opinion, the 
evidence is not sufficient to support the offense (treason) charged, the 
People's Court, may, nevertheless, convict and sentence the accused for any 
crime includes in the acts alleged in the information and established by the 
evidence."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">All the above mentioned rapes are alleged in the information 
and substantiated by the evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel assails the constitutionality of this provision as 
violative of section 1, Paragraph 17, Article III of the Constitution, which 
guarantees to an accused the right "to be informed of the nature and cause of 
the accusation against him." The contention is not well taken. The provision in 
question requires that the private crimes of which an accused of treason may be 
convicted must be averred in the information and sustained by evidence. In the 
light of this enactment, the defendant was warned of the hazard that he might be 
found guilty of rapes if he was innocent of treason and thus afforded an 
opportunity to prepare and meet them. There is no element of surprise or anomaly 
involved. In fact, under the general law of criminal procedure, conviction for a 
crime different from that designated in the complaint or information is allowed 
and practised, provided only that such crime "is included or described in the 
body of the information, and is afterwards justified by the proof presented 
during the trial." (People vs. Perez, 45 Phil., 599.)</p>
<p align="justify">The defendant personally assaulted and abused two of the 
offended girls but these assaults are not charged against him and should be 
ruled, out. The crime of coercion alleged and found on count No. 6 need not be 
noticed in view of the severity of the penalty for the other crimes which he 
must suffer.</p>
<p align="justify">We find the defendant guilty of four separate crimes of rape 
and sentence him for each of them to an indeterminate penalty of from 10 years 
of <i>prision mayor</i> to 17 years and 4 months of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, 
with the accessories of law, to indemnify each of the offended women in the sum 
of P3,000, and to pay the costs; it being understood that the total duration of 
these penalties shall not exceed forty years.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">Paras, <i>J.</i>, I reserve my vote.</p>

<p align="center"><i>DISIDENTE</i></p>
<p align="justify">PABLO, <i>M.</i>: </p>
<p align="justify">Disiento En mi opinion, los hechos probados constituyen delito 
de traicidn.</p>
<p align="justify">El acusado, al reclutar con sus companeros, muchas senoritas de 
buena reputacl6n en Bohol para ponerlas a disposici6n de los oficiales del 
ejSrcito enemigo, ha ayudado a ellos en la obra de destruccifin. En la guerra se 
emplea la destrucci6n para triunfar, y la destrucci6n se realiza en las cosas y 
en las personas, Inutilizar para el trabajo o para la guerra a los habitantes 
del pals invadido es destruirles en mayor o menor grado y violar. o deshonrar a 
las mujeres es tambiSn destruirlas material y moralmente y es peor aun que matar 
y aniquilar. En el caso presente, el acusado ayud&lt;5 al Coronel Mini y Dr. 
Takibayas en deshonrar a varias senoritas, ponie'ndolas en una situacidn peor 
que la de las esclavas. Si el reclutar a hombres o mujeres para ser obligados a 
construir trinciieras para el ejSrcito invasor constituye delito de traicifin; 
si el apoderarse del arroz de los ciudadanos en sus casas para dSrselo a los 
soldados hamtoientos del ejircito japon§s es traici6n; por qu5 no ha de 
constituir traici6n el reclutar a senoritas para ser utilizadas por los enemigos 
en sus deseos bestiales, como 2 G. R. No, L-856 m .medio de entreteniraiento o 
alivio de sus trabajos? Plaviana y Feliciana Bonalos, ilegalmente arrestadas y 
entregadas despuSs a los dos oficiales-bestias, en su declaraci6n, han dicho que 
hubieran preferido morir que ser violadas.</p>
<p align="justify">El argumento del Procurador General, que merece seria 
consideraci6n, es del tenor siguientes</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the United States Army, and we believe this is also true in 
the Japanese Imperial Forces, a unit known as the United Services Organization 
(U.S.O.) functions with the primordial aim and view to keep at peak the morale 
of the soldiers. To achieve this, varied forms of entertainment like movies, 
dances, stage shows and the like are provided for at an enormous expense. In 
fine, the soldiers are surrounded with all the comforts and opportunities that 
they ordinarily enjoy in their normal civilian life. The reason for this is to 
tone their nerves and minimize as much as possible, the heavy strain on them 
incident to the nature of their mission in time of war. Such entertainment 
becomes the more imperative when it comes to soldiers who are assigned overseas, 
on a foreign soil} in a no man's land, devoid of the inspiring association of 
their families, girl friends, and all those dearest to them,</p>
<p align="justify">xxx Clearly, therefore, appellant provided them with what 
should have been the burden of the Japanese Imperial Forces, relieving the 
latter of the trouble, expense, and difficulty of sending over to these Islands 
Japanese women to entertain their soldiers to bolster up their morale. In other 
words, the services of the Japanese women, who were so replaced by ours, through 
the efforts of the appellant, could be diverted to other important phases of 
military activities either in the homeland or in this sector. Hence, the aid and 
comfort to the enemy is evident.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Si el Coronel Mini y Dr. Takibayas del eje'rcito japones no 
encontraban otro consuelo o solaz para olvidar sus preocupaciones y tristezas 
ma's que en saciar su lujuria, enJf £ G. R. No. L-856 tonces el proporcionarles 
mujeres contra la voluntad de Sstas es ayudarles en recuperar entusiasmos 
perdidos e infundirles nuevo vigor para proseguir la guerra de conquista, Bien 
sabido est^ que los soldados no son m&amp;quirias de acero que pueden estar 
peleando todas las horas de todos los dlas; necesitan tiempo de descanso para 
recuperar fuerzas perdidas, de entreteniraiento para olvidar irtJgubres. 
pensamientos y franco esparcimiento para vigorizar su esp£ritu. Si para el 
Coronel Mini y Dr. TaMbayas, el violar la las sefioritas reclutadas por el 
acusado era buena recompensa de sus esfuerzos militares, entonces para ellos 
vale la pena de exponer la vida en la lucha porque. despuls de todo quedan bien 
compensados, Qu^ mayor satisfaccidn para ellos como la de disfrutar libremente 
de las senoritas de la provincia con la ayuda del acusado? Por esa satisfaccKSn, 
redoblarian sus esfuerzos de conquista para tener otras oportunidades de saciar 
sus apetitos bestiales* Bajo tales inclinaciones morbosas, darles 
entretenimientO} solaz y esparcimiento es ayudarles en. la guerra.</p>
<p align="justify">No es exagerado suponer que dichos oficiales japoneses hiayan 
dejado en su pals hijos, esposas y madres a quienes quieren de coraz6n, y en sus 
momentos de soledad, de tristeza y de nostalgia, no es iraposible que se 
acuerden de ellos y lleguen a decir para sf misraosr !'Qu6 sacamos de .esta

hogares abandonados s6lo para h G. R. No. L-856 satlsfacer las ambiciones de

unos Simples instrumentos para sacrificar tantas vidas y haciendas para la 
vanagloria del ;jap6n, se nos rebela la conciencia. Creemos que la guerra es 
inicua, injustar debemos abandonarla. No deberaos continuar invadiendo 
territorios." Si estos pensamientos persistiesen en la mente de dichos 
oficiales, indudablemente perderian su entusiasmo, su eficiencia en el servicios 
su obsesi6n les haria indiferentes, pasivos, inutiles para la guerra. Pueden 
deponer su actitud, ptxeden cruzarse de brazos e inclusive pueden desertar, y 
eso serla fatal para la naci6n invasora, Pero si, por inclinaci6n natural, 
encuenitran entretenimiento, esparcimiento y alegrla en violar raujeres, 
entonces el proporcionarseles es una ayuda efectiva, Es darles calor, entusiasmo 
y valor en la guerra de conquista.</p>
<p align="justify">Hay mayor traicidn como el poner a disposici6n de los enemigos 
al ser mis querido, a la mujer Que se apoderen de todos nuestros productos, de 
todos nuestros recursos de todo cuanto encuentram &amp; su paso; pero, por Dios, 
salvemos el honor de nuestras mujeres.</p>
<p align="justify">Voto por que el acusado sea condenado por el delito de
