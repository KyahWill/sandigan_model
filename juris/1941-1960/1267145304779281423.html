				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners-appellants Apolinario de la Cruz, et al. are appealing the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Dagupan of&nbsp; October 29, 1957,&nbsp; denying their petition for prohibition sought to restrain the&nbsp; City Fiscal of Dagupan City from filing an information against them or further prosecuting them for falsification of public document. <br><br>Carmelita de la Cruz filed in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Lingayen,&nbsp; Pangasinan, a&nbsp; complaint dated&nbsp; August 22, 1957, against Apolinario de&nbsp; la Cruz, for the&nbsp; purpose of declaring null&nbsp; and void the&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; of adjudication executed by him, wherein he declared&nbsp; that he was the only heir of Francisca Bandong and adjudicated&nbsp; unto himself a&nbsp; parcel of land left by her.&nbsp; Carmelita claims that&nbsp; said parcel belongs to her, having inherited the same from her father Ludovico de la Cruz, to&nbsp; whom it had&nbsp; been donated by Francisca.&nbsp; In his answer, Apolinario alleged&nbsp; that the affidavit of adjudication was made by him in good faith, the same having been&nbsp; executed with the consent&nbsp; of all the heirs of Francisca.&nbsp; In his cross-complaint, he claimed that the deed of donation invoked by Carmelita was fictitious, and so should&nbsp; be declared null&nbsp; and&nbsp; void.<br><br>On September&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; petitioners-appellants&nbsp; were summoned by the Dagupan&nbsp; City&nbsp; Fiscal to appear before him&nbsp; for investigation of the&nbsp; charge&nbsp; of&nbsp; falsification of public&nbsp; document&nbsp; in connection&nbsp; with the affidavit&nbsp; of adjudication&nbsp; made by Apolinario.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel for petitioners-appellants&nbsp; informed the&nbsp; fiscal that there were two pending civil&nbsp; cases&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Lingayen, Pangasinan, one for&nbsp; the annulment of the deed of adjudication&nbsp; above referred&nbsp; to, and the other to annulment of the deed of donation said to have been made by Francisca in favor of Ludovico de la Cruz, and that this&nbsp; constituted a prejudicial question which warranted the criminal action being held in abeyance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch&nbsp; as the Fiscal proposed to&nbsp; continue&nbsp; with his investigation, petitioners-appellants filed&nbsp; their petition for prohibition, which as already stated, was&nbsp; denied by the trial&nbsp; court.&nbsp; We&nbsp; reproduce that portion of&nbsp; the appealed order of the trial&nbsp; court, which gives its reason for the denial of the petition:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * the contention of petitioners is untenable, as the civil action for annulment of the&nbsp; deed of adjudication has no connection whatsoever with&nbsp; the investigation being made by the City Fiscal over the fact that the petitioner, Apolinario de la Cruz, in said writ of adjudication&nbsp; made it&nbsp; appear that he&nbsp; was the only&nbsp; heir when in truth and in fact there were other heirs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear that the information&nbsp; of falsification of public document does not in one way or another affect&nbsp; the pending civil case&nbsp; of annulment of said deed of adjudication.<br><br>"With respect to the other pending civil case for the annulment of the deed of donation, it should be&nbsp; noted&nbsp; that Apolinario de la Cruz, the petitioner in this case,&nbsp; is not a&nbsp; party to the donation, and the investigation made on him by the&nbsp; City Fiscal for falsification of public&nbsp; document, is entirely foreign and distinct&nbsp; from that civil case&nbsp; for annulment of the&nbsp; deed of donation.<br><br>"The foregoing facts show that the investigation being conducted by&nbsp; the City Fiscal of&nbsp; this City, for the falsification of public document against the herein petitioner has&nbsp; no bearing nor relation with the two civil cases which were&nbsp; pending&nbsp; for trial before the Court of First Instance of Lingayen, and as such the petitioner, can not now invoke the theory of prejudicial question."&nbsp; (Record, pp. 55-56)<br></blockquote>Prejudicial&nbsp; question has been defined and explained as follows:<br><blockquote>"* * * that which arises in a case, the resolution of which (question)&nbsp; is a logical&nbsp; antecedent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue involved in said case, arid the cognizance of which pertains to another tribunal (Cuestion prejudicial, es la&nbsp; que&nbsp; surge en un&nbsp; pleito&nbsp; o causa cuya resolucion es antecedente logico de la cuestion objeto del&nbsp; pleito o causa&nbsp; y cuyo conocimiento&nbsp; corresponda&nbsp; a los tribunales de otro orden o jurisdiccion.—X Enciclopedia Juridica Española,&nbsp; p. 228).&nbsp; The prejudicial question must be&nbsp; determinative of the case before&nbsp; the court; this is its first&nbsp; element.&nbsp; Jurisdiction&nbsp; to try&nbsp; said question must be lodged in another tribunal; this is the second element."&nbsp;&nbsp; (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Aragon, 94 Phil., 357;&nbsp; 50 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. [10],&nbsp; 4863).<br><br>"Prejudicial question is understood in law to be that which must precede the criminal action, that&nbsp; which requires a decision before a final&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; is rendered&nbsp; in&nbsp; the principal&nbsp; action&nbsp; with which said question&nbsp; is closely connected.&nbsp; Not all previous questions&nbsp; are prejudicial, although all prejudicial questions&nbsp; are necessarily previous,"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Herbari&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Concepcion, 40 Phil.,&nbsp; 837).<br><br>"A civil action is prejudicial when it&nbsp; refers to a fact separate and distinct from the offense charged but yet so intimately related thereto as to be determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused.&nbsp; For example, a civil&nbsp; action for the annulment&nbsp; of the second marriage is, with respect&nbsp; to the criminal charge for bigamy a prejudicial question&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; require&nbsp; its&nbsp; adjudication before the criminal prosecution may proceed.&nbsp; However, where the only&nbsp; ground upon which the&nbsp; civil&nbsp; action for annulment is&nbsp; based is&nbsp; that&nbsp; the second&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; was contracted&nbsp; allegedly in good faith at&nbsp; a time when&nbsp; the first marriage was still in existence, such civil action does&nbsp; not constitute a prejudicial question for there is no issue therein that&nbsp; may&nbsp; be determinative of petitioner's innocence in the criminal case.&nbsp; That second&nbsp; marriage was contracted in good faith is immaterial in the civil action.&nbsp; It is material&nbsp; only in the criminal case to show lack of criminal&nbsp; intent."&nbsp; (II Moran,&nbsp; pp. 652-653, 1957&nbsp; ed.)<br></blockquote>As regards the annulment of the deed of donation sought by&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Apolinario&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; cross-complaint&nbsp; before the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Lingayen, Pangasinan, we agree&nbsp; with the&nbsp; trial court that it has no&nbsp; intimate relation to the criminal investigation&nbsp; being conducted by respondent Fiscal, Apolinario not even being a party to&nbsp; said&nbsp; deed of donation; consequently,&nbsp; it may by no means be regarded as a prejudicial question.<br><br>Now, with respect to the annulment of&nbsp; the affidavit of adjudication&nbsp; sought by Carmella the execution&nbsp; by Apolinario of said&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; with its narration of&nbsp; facts, is&nbsp; intimately related to his guilt&nbsp; or innocence of&nbsp; the charge of&nbsp; falsification being investigated&nbsp; by the Fiscal, it is true; however,&nbsp; resolution of the petition for annulment of the affidavit of adjudication, affirmative or other wise,&nbsp; does not and&nbsp; will not&nbsp; determine&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; responsibility&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; falsification&nbsp; case.&nbsp; Regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; the outcome of the&nbsp; pending civil case for annulment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the affidavit of adjudication, determination&nbsp; of the charge of falsification would be based on the truth&nbsp; or falsity of the narration of facts in the affidavit of&nbsp; adjudication, specially with reference to the existence of heirs of Francisca besides Apolinario.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; the civil case aforementioned does not&nbsp; involve a prejudicial&nbsp; question.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the appealed order is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Conception, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. </div>
