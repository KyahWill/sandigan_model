				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On&nbsp; January 25, 1955,&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; this&nbsp; action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the&nbsp; defendants, alleging in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; that&nbsp; they were&nbsp; employees of the Philippine&nbsp; National Red Cross;&nbsp; that since March 22, 1947, they had rendered overtime services from 2 to 16 hours every day, including Sundays and holidays, for which each of the plaintiffs&nbsp; should be&nbsp; paid&nbsp; the sum of P5,000, <i>more or less</i>, value of their overtime work already earned; that in the case of Esteban&nbsp; Madera said amount of P5,000 includes underpayment&nbsp; not&nbsp; paid to him as provided for in the Minimum Wage&nbsp; Law, and&nbsp; as defendants allegedly&nbsp; failed and&nbsp; refused to pay&nbsp; said overtime work and underpayment, they prayed the Court to render judgment (a) enjoining defendants from dismissing or threatening to dismiss plaintiffs;&nbsp; (b) ordering the&nbsp; defendants to pay each plaintiff the sum of&nbsp; P5,000, more or&nbsp; less;&nbsp; (c) compelling the defendants&nbsp; to pay additional sum of P6,400 as attorney's fees; and&nbsp; (d) granting unto&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs such other reliefs as may be deemed proper in the premises. <br><br>Before&nbsp; answering the&nbsp; complaint the Solicitor&nbsp; General's office filed for the defendants for motion for bill of particulars in order to enable them to plead intelligently or prepare adequately their responsive pleading thereto, giving as a reason for the motion that aside from&nbsp; the fact that the demand of P5,000 for&nbsp; each of the plaintiffs (P60,000 for all of them) is fantastic, the complaint does not state who among the said plaintiffs have&nbsp; rendered 16 hours' work during the&nbsp; said&nbsp; number&nbsp; of years and did not specify the number of supposed overtime hours rendered by each of them, the rate of salaries and wages during the entire period for which such overtime is claimed; the time during which regular and&nbsp; overtime&nbsp; work have been performed during Sundays and official holidays; and the exact amount of undertime, apart from&nbsp; the overtime, supposedly due to plaintiff Esteban&nbsp; Madera. <br><br>This motion for a bill of particulars was objected to by the plaintiffs- and their&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; was retorted by&nbsp; the defendants, after&nbsp; which the Court&nbsp; by order&nbsp; of&nbsp; February 18, 1955, directed plaintiffs to amend their complaint by making sufficient&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; on&nbsp; the points&nbsp; indicated by the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; in paragraph&nbsp; 5&nbsp; of their&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; bill of particulars.&nbsp; After plaintiffs'&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration of this order was denied, plaintiffs submitted a&nbsp; so-called bill&nbsp; of particulars indicating the alleged aggregate total&nbsp; of overtime&nbsp; hours&nbsp; rendered by each&nbsp; plaintiff (such as 14,000 hours, 12,000 hours, 10,000 hours, 8,000 hours or 5,000, <i>more or less</i>, without reference to the dates in which the laborer actually rendered said overtime&nbsp; hours),&nbsp; the rates&nbsp; of salaries&nbsp; per&nbsp; month during the entire period of their&nbsp; employment (or daily,&nbsp; as&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Esteban Madera), and the overtime performed by&nbsp; plaintiffs (undoubtedly, referring&nbsp; to all of&nbsp; them) during Sundays and holidays, which started&nbsp; at 8:00&nbsp; a.m., Sunday or&nbsp; holiday till 4:00 p.m., the&nbsp; next day—Monday or otherwise—equivalent to 32 hours'&nbsp; continuous service,&nbsp; and stating that the underpayment&nbsp; of&nbsp; Esteban Madera&nbsp; amounted to&nbsp; P2,000, <i>more&nbsp; or&nbsp; less</i>. <br><br>Upon receipt of this bill of particulars and without considering&nbsp; if it was sufficiently&nbsp; explicit or&nbsp; clear to&nbsp; enable defendants to answer, counsel&nbsp; for the latter filed on March 23,&nbsp; 1955 a motion to dismiss on&nbsp; the ground that the complaint did&nbsp; not&nbsp; allege facts sufficient to constitute&nbsp; a valid cause of action. <br><br>This motion was&nbsp; objected&nbsp; to&nbsp; by plaintiffs, and after both parties exhausted their arguments in support of their respective contentions, the&nbsp; Court by order of&nbsp; April&nbsp; 18, 1955, dismissed the complaint filed by the plaintiffs without special&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court reasoned out its&nbsp; order as&nbsp; follows: <br><blockquote>"It will&nbsp; be noted from the above provisions&nbsp; (Sec. 2 of Common- wealth Act No. 444)&nbsp; that the law&nbsp; 'shall&nbsp; apply only to all persons employed in any&nbsp; industry or occupation, whether public or private *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *.'&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiffs themselves admit that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant, in truth and&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; is&nbsp; an organization entirely devoted to charity. It&nbsp; is not&nbsp; a&nbsp; profit&nbsp; making&nbsp;&nbsp; organization;&nbsp; its&nbsp; funds are dependent on&nbsp; the voluntary contributions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; public.&nbsp; Plaintiffs maintain that the Philippine National Eed Gross,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; is not among&nbsp; those mentioned&nbsp; in&nbsp; the exception and&nbsp; therefore should&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed to ' be&nbsp; one&nbsp; of those upon&nbsp; whom&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law&nbsp; shall apply.&nbsp; The contention is,&nbsp; in the opinion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court, unfounded.&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; believes and bo holds that the laws, <i>in referring to persons employed in an industry or occupation, does not refer&nbsp; to the</i>&nbsp; EMPLOYEE HIMSELF <i>but to the</i>&nbsp; EMPLOYER&nbsp; <i>who must&nbsp; be engaged&nbsp; in an industry&nbsp; or&nbsp; occupation</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The exception&nbsp; mentioned in&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2 aforecited&nbsp; refer to&nbsp; the&nbsp; employees&nbsp; who, although employed&nbsp; in an industry&nbsp; or occupation, do not fall under the general&nbsp; provision&nbsp; and are not entitled to the benefits: of the law if they are 'farm laborers, laborers who prefer to be paid on weekly basis, and persons in the&nbsp; personal&nbsp; service&nbsp; of another and&nbsp; members of the family&nbsp; of the employer working&nbsp; for&nbsp; him.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; hold&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Eed&nbsp; Cross, Inc., subject to the operation of the law would be tantamount to curtailing its&nbsp; activities&nbsp; to the prejudice of the welfare and&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of the general public,&nbsp; particularly the victims of a catastrophe.&nbsp; One may imagine,&nbsp; for instance, the&nbsp; result if those persons&nbsp; now engaged by&nbsp; the Red&nbsp; Cross&nbsp; in its&nbsp; relief work&nbsp; among&nbsp; the&nbsp; victims&nbsp; of the recent earthquakes should refuse&nbsp; to work overtime unless paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; The funds1 of the&nbsp; Red Cross,&nbsp; meager&nbsp; as&nbsp; they are, would be consumed in overtime&nbsp; pay instead of being spent for the relief of those afflicted. Such a result certainly&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; said to have&nbsp; been intended by the Legislature." </blockquote>After plaintiffs'&nbsp; motion to set&nbsp; aside the order and&nbsp; for trial was&nbsp; denied,&nbsp; plaintiffs brought up this case to Us and in&nbsp; this&nbsp; instance&nbsp; their&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; maintains&nbsp; that the&nbsp; lower Court erred: <br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; In holding that&nbsp; the Philippine National Eed Cross Is&nbsp; not covered by&nbsp; Commonwealth. Act No. 444 otherwise known as&nbsp; the&nbsp; Eight-Hour Labor&nbsp; Law;<br><br>&nbsp;2. In holding that the Philippine National Red Cross; is not covered by Republic Act No. 602 otherwise known as the Minimum&nbsp; 'Wages Law;&nbsp; and <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;3. In dismissing&nbsp; plaintiffs-appelants' complaint. </blockquote>As may be seen from the foregoing, the only question at issue in this appeal&nbsp; refers to the applicability&nbsp; of the provisions of the Eight-Hour Labor&nbsp; Law to charitable&nbsp; institutions like the defendant Philippine National&nbsp; Red Cross. <br>&nbsp;<br>Section 2 of Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 444&nbsp; upon which plaintiffs base their&nbsp; cause of action, reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 2. This Act shall apply to all persons employed in an industry or occupation, whether public or private, with the exception of farm laborers, laborers who' prefer&nbsp; to be paid on piece work basis, domestic servants and persons in the personal service of another and members of the family&nbsp; of the&nbsp; employer working&nbsp; for him."</blockquote>The solution of the whole&nbsp; controversy&nbsp; depends&nbsp; upon whether defendant Philippine National Red Cross is engaged "in an industry or&nbsp; occupation", as this phrase&nbsp; is&nbsp; used in the section just quoted. <br><br>Plaintiffs&nbsp; submit&nbsp; to&nbsp; Our&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; the following: (1)&nbsp; are&nbsp; plaintiffs-appellants the persons&nbsp; excepted&nbsp; from the operation of the Eight-Hour Labor Law as provided for in Section 2 thereof?; and (2) are plaintiffs-appellants <i>employed in&nbsp; any industry or occupation</i>?&nbsp; Answering these questions counsel for plaintiffs states that with regard to the first, the answer is too obvious to require proof, for plaintiffs-appellants have been in the employ of the&nbsp; Philippine National Red Cross as janitors, drivers, technicians and manual laborers.&nbsp; "Occupation", as defined, is a trade, calling, vocation,&nbsp; profession, employment or business&nbsp; by which one generally earns his living (67 C.J.S. 76), and under this definition&nbsp; plaintiffs'&nbsp; employment with the&nbsp; Philippine National&nbsp; Red Cross is&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly an occupation. Hence, counsel argues,&nbsp; plaintiffs are not the presons excepted in said&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2 of&nbsp; the law. <br><br>As&nbsp; to the&nbsp; second question, plaintiffs do not dispute that the Philippine&nbsp; National Red Cross "is not engaged&nbsp; in any industry, for the soJe purpose for which this&nbsp; institution has been created, as known the world over, is to perform purely&nbsp; humanitarian&nbsp; work.&nbsp; Hence, it couid not be&nbsp; said that plaintiffs-appellants&nbsp; are employed in&nbsp; any&nbsp; industry engaged in by the Philippine NationaJ Red Cross."&nbsp; What plaintiffs,&nbsp; however, maintain is that <i>they are employed by the Philippine National&nbsp; Red Cross in&nbsp; its&nbsp; occupation of performing humanitarian work.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewed&nbsp; in the light of the meaning1 of the word "occupation" as given before, plaintiffs ask&nbsp; may it then be said that the Philippine National Red Cross&nbsp; is engaged&nbsp; in an occupation?&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiffs also claim that the answer is obvious, for performance of humanitarian work by the Philippine National Red Cross, though not for any financial reward, does not cease to be an occupation.&nbsp; In support of their contention plaintiffs submitted in the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; the&nbsp; communication&nbsp; of the Secretary&nbsp; of Labor, Jose&nbsp; Fig'ueras, dated&nbsp; November 18, 1952,&nbsp; wherein this Department Head&nbsp; held&nbsp; the opinion that Commonwealth Act No. 444 applies "to all persons employed in&nbsp; any&nbsp; industry or <i>occupation</i>", whether&nbsp; public or private,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; exception&nbsp; enumerated&nbsp; in the law, such as farm laborers, laborers who prefer to be paid on piece work basis, domestic servants, etc., and that on the basis of this&nbsp; provision, the fact that the Philippine National Red Cross is a charitable or non-profit institution does not draw its workers away from the coverage of the law.&nbsp; This question, according to&nbsp; said Secretary,&nbsp; has been settled by this Court in the case of Elks&nbsp; Club&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Rovira,&nbsp; (80 Phil., 272, 45 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. No. 9, p. 3829).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> &nbsp;<br><br>Plaintiffs further argue that the aims and purposes for which the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; National&nbsp; Red&nbsp; Cross was created certainly are noble and lofty&nbsp; and become more so when viewed against the background of a material world.&nbsp; But in the attainment&nbsp; of the same, however noble and lofty, such end should never justify the means.&nbsp; If the Philippine National Red Cross must be uncharitable to its employees in order that it may be&nbsp; charitable to&nbsp; others, this institution would cease to be consistent with the purpose for&nbsp; which it was&nbsp; created.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine National Red Cross can attain its noble aims and purposes without being uncharitable&nbsp; to its lowest paid employees. <br><br>On the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, defendants call attention&nbsp; to. the fact&nbsp; that under&nbsp; Section 3 of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 95, the defendant Philippine National&nbsp; Red Cross&nbsp; was&nbsp; created as a&nbsp; public corporation charged with the duty of assisting the Republic of the Philippines in "discharging the obligations set forth in the Geneva&nbsp; Red Cross&nbsp; Convention&nbsp; and to perform such other duties&nbsp; as are incumbent upon&nbsp; a national red cross society", its main purposes being, among others:&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; to furnish volunteer aid to the sick and wounded of armed forces&nbsp; in time of war, in&nbsp; accordance with the spirit of and under the conditions prescribed by the Geneva Red&nbsp; Cross Convention;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; to act in matters of voluntary relief and&nbsp; in accord with the authorities of the Armed Forces as a medium of communication between&nbsp; the people of the Republic of the Philippines and their Armed Forces; (c)&nbsp; to establish&nbsp; and maintain a&nbsp; system&nbsp; of national and international relief in time of&nbsp; peace and in time of war; and&nbsp; (d) to devise and promote&nbsp; such other services as may be found desirable in improving the health, safety and welfare of&nbsp; the Filipino&nbsp; people.<br><br>Such being the ends and purposes of the creation of the Philippine&nbsp; National Red Cross, defendants claim that it would be stating the obvious&nbsp; to&nbsp; say&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendant Red&nbsp; Cross&nbsp; is a&nbsp; purely charitable organization engaged exclusively in humanitarian work and never as a government entity carrying a trade,&nbsp; industry or occupation.<br><br>Defendants further state that the provisions of the law governing payments of overtime and extra compensation for work done&nbsp; during Sundays and legal&nbsp; holidays—as, embodied in Commonwealth Act No. 444—shall apply only to persons or corporations, whether public or private, which are engaged in any Occupation or Industry and defendant Red Cross not being a government&nbsp; entity engaged in any "occupation&nbsp; or. industry",&nbsp; but in purely humanitarian and charitable work, it may not be held liable for payment of overtime services to its employees, assuming again arguendo that any such overtime work was&nbsp; performed. <br><br>Besides—counsel&nbsp; for defendants&nbsp; continues—the&nbsp; funds supporting the Red Cross come from voluntary contribution from&nbsp; the government&nbsp; and from every&nbsp; man, woman and child throughout the world, irrespective of race and creed, and to hold that the Red Cross, like&nbsp; other public or private entity engaged in&nbsp; "industry or&nbsp; occupation",&nbsp; is liable for overtime pay to its&nbsp; workers&nbsp; and employees,&nbsp; would be to render the noble purposes of its existence useless and illusory, for what should be otherwise&nbsp; devoted to its mission of mercy, could hardly cover up for such overtime&nbsp; wages and, certainly, Congress could not have thought of&nbsp; applying the provisions of the&nbsp; Eight-Hour Labor&nbsp; Law, or any other labor&nbsp; law for that&nbsp; matter, to&nbsp; the Red Cross.&nbsp; As a persuasive authority counsel for&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; submits Opinion No.&nbsp; 102, series of 1954, of Secretary of Justice Pedro&nbsp; Tuazoii holding&nbsp; the points of view just mentioned. <br><br>In passing&nbsp; upon&nbsp; these&nbsp; conflicting contentions,&nbsp; We can state beforehand that We&nbsp; fully agree&nbsp; with the trial&nbsp; Judge that the phrase employed&nbsp; (in an institution engaged) "in an industry or occupation", as used in&nbsp; section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 444, does&nbsp; not refer to the <i>employees</i> but to the <i>employer</i>, who&nbsp; is the&nbsp; one that shall be engaged in an&nbsp; industry or occupation.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; dispute that the Philippine National Red Cross is not engaged in any industry&nbsp; and the Gordian knot of the&nbsp; problems has to be' cut by Our determination&nbsp; of whether&nbsp; the Philippine National&nbsp; Red&nbsp; Cross&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; an <i>occupation</i>, as this word is used&nbsp; in, or&nbsp; according to the&nbsp; meaning Congress intended&nbsp; to impart&nbsp; to&nbsp; said&nbsp; section 2&nbsp; of&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 444.<br><br>As stated by&nbsp; appellants, in&nbsp; common&nbsp; parlance We&nbsp; all may agree&nbsp; that the Philippine National Red&nbsp; Cross is engaged or <i>employed in the occupation</i> of performing humanitarian&nbsp; work.<br><blockquote>"Granting&nbsp; that the 'Salvation&nbsp; Army"&nbsp; is not&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; trade and that it has no profession,&nbsp; and without deciding whether or not it has a business, it must&nbsp; be&nbsp; held .that its activities are&nbsp; described by the word&nbsp; 'occupation'".&nbsp;&nbsp; (67 C. J.&nbsp; S.. 76).</blockquote> But&nbsp; is sueh occupation&nbsp; what was meant by said word in aforementioned provision of&nbsp; the Eight-Hour Labor&nbsp; Law?<br><blockquote>"OCCUPATION.&nbsp; The word may be&nbsp; employed&nbsp; as referring to the act or process of occupying1, the state of being occupied,&nbsp; occupancy or tenure; and as used in this sense the word is denned in the C.J.S. title Property, par. 14, also&nbsp; 46&nbsp; C.J. p. 895 note 72—p-. 896 note 96".<br><br>"The&nbsp; word&nbsp; 'occupation' also is&nbsp; employed as&nbsp; referring to that which occupies time and&nbsp; attention; a calling or a trade; and it is <i>only</i> as applied in this sense that the word is discussed in the following paragraphs" (67 C.&nbsp; J. S. 74).<br><br>"OCCUPATION has been&nbsp; held properly applicable to various activities and pursuits&nbsp; such as the&nbsp; practice of medicine or dentistry, farming, undertaking1 and store-keeping,&nbsp; and in other instances, the term has been held inapplicable."&nbsp;&nbsp; (67 C. J. S. 76) <br><br>"The&nbsp; word&nbsp; 'occupation'&nbsp; is&nbsp; frequently defined&nbsp; as&nbsp; meaning the business&nbsp; in which one principally engages <i>in order&nbsp; to procure&nbsp; a living or obtain wealth</i> (Cohen vs.&nbsp; State, 53 Tex. Cr. 422); the trade, calling,&nbsp; vocation, profession,&nbsp; office,&nbsp; employment,&nbsp; or business&nbsp; by which <i>one generally&nbsp; earns&nbsp; his&nbsp; living</i> (Johnson vs. State,&nbsp; 138 Tex. Cr. 370;&nbsp; Anderson va.&nbsp; State, 70 Tex. Cr. 250; Shed vs. State, 70 Tex. Cr.&nbsp; 10); whatever one&nbsp; follows <i>as the means of making a livelihood</i>,"&nbsp; (Sovereign Camp W.O.W. vs. Craft, 20S&nbsp; Ala. 467)<br><br>"The word&nbsp; 'occupation' has reference to the principal or regular business&nbsp; of one's life, or that to which&nbsp; one devotes&nbsp; his time and attention, such as trade, profession, or other vocation&nbsp; or calling, or that which principally takes up one's time, thought,&nbsp; and energy, specially one's regular business, or .employment,&nbsp; or&nbsp; whatever one <i>follows as&nbsp; a&nbsp; means of making a livelihood</i>&nbsp; (Benefit Ass'n of Ry. Employees vs. Seerest, 239 ILj. 400).&nbsp; The word particularly refers to the vocation, profession, trade, or calling in which a <i>person is engage for hire or for profit</i> (Scott vs. Freeport Motor Cas. Co. of Freeport, 392 111.&nbsp; 332), and&nbsp; it has&nbsp; been&nbsp; repeatedly&nbsp; held that a person's <i>principal business and chief -means&nbsp; of obtaining a livelihood</i> constitute his occupation—Farmers Automobile and Inter-Insurance Exchange vs. Calkins, 39&nbsp; Cal. Apr,. 2d 390" (67 C. J.&nbsp; S. 75-76).</blockquote> From the foregoing authorities We see&nbsp; that the word&nbsp; "occupation" ordinarily implies the idea&nbsp; of one's employ&nbsp; ment in a principal or regular business or the dedication of |||j&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time and attention to&nbsp; a trade, profession or calling which is taken <i>up as a means&nbsp; of making livelihood, or for profit, or for the obtention of wealth</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, the weight of authority is to the effect that in its legal sense and as used&nbsp; in labor laws, the term "occupation"&nbsp; ordinarily involves the idea of gain, profit or return for the time, attention and energies devoted in the performance of the occupation&nbsp; by either the&nbsp; master&nbsp; or the servant concerned. For these reasons We share in the aforementioned opinion of the&nbsp; Secretary of Justice,&nbsp; that the Philippine National Red Cross&nbsp; is&nbsp; not subject&nbsp; to the Eight-Hour Labor Law. It&nbsp; is&nbsp; neither in&nbsp; business, nor&nbsp; an&nbsp; industrial&nbsp; enterprise organized for profit,&nbsp; but engaged in&nbsp; purely humanitarian work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of&nbsp; course, as&nbsp; said Secretary of&nbsp; Justice further explains: <br><blockquote>"This does not mean that it&nbsp; cannot extend the benefits of the Act to its employees.&nbsp; As pointed out&nbsp; in Opinion&nbsp; No. 142,&nbsp; series' of 1939,&nbsp; Common wealth Act&nbsp; No. 444&nbsp; may be extended to employees and laborers&nbsp; of the Government as a matter of&nbsp; administrative policy if (1) tht&gt; current appropriation so allow, and (2)&nbsp; if it is consistent with publie interest.&nbsp; (See also Op. of Sec. of Justice No. 175, series of 1939).&nbsp; Accordingly, a^ ji&nbsp; matter&nbsp; of policy and in the exercise of its power to determine&nbsp; the compensation of the paid staff of the corporation&nbsp; (Sec. 6,&nbsp; Rep.&nbsp; Act No. 95),&nbsp; the Board of Governors of the&nbsp; Philippine National Red Cross may extend&nbsp; the benefits 'of the Eight-Hour Labor Law to its employees if, and to the extent that, the financial&nbsp; condition of the&nbsp; corporation would warrant." </blockquote>We,&nbsp; therefore, declare&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiffs-appellants cannot demand as&nbsp; a matter of right the&nbsp; application to them of the provisions&nbsp; of the Eight-Hour Labor Law.<br><br>Plaintiff's second assignment of error refers to an alleged declaration of the trial Judge "that the Philippine National Red Cross is not governed by Republic Act No. 602 otherwise known as the Minimum Wage Law".&nbsp; We have care- fully gone&nbsp; over&nbsp; the order appealed from and We do not find therein any reference to said Act. <br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from being&nbsp; in consonance with the&nbsp; law on the matter, the&nbsp; same is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L</i>., and <i>Endencia, JJ</i>., concur. Order affirmed.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> This&nbsp; case has&nbsp; no bearing on the points in&nbsp; controversy herein, for it refers to whether air not the employees of the Elks&nbsp; Club could be considered as&nbsp; <i>domestic servants</i>&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; meaning of section 2 of Act No. 444 and not&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; Elks Club was an industrial organization,&nbsp; taking&nbsp; into consideration&nbsp; its&nbsp; purpose and activities.</div>
