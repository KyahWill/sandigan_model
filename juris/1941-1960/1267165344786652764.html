				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review of&nbsp; a decision of the Court of Appeals&nbsp; setting aside the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Nueva&nbsp; Ecija&nbsp; court of first instance in a certain civil case and ordering a new&nbsp; trial.<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; Maxima and Tomasa&nbsp; Grospe&nbsp; filed in said provincial court, a complaint to recover from Augusto Uera, damages in the total sum of P4,500.00 plus attorney's fees, due to malicious prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; the trial, neither defendant&nbsp; nor his&nbsp; counsel appeared. Whereupon, plaintiffs presented their evidence, in view of which judgment was rendered ordering&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; P3,000.00&nbsp; to each of them&nbsp; in addition to costs.&nbsp; Copy of the judgment was received by Uera's counsel on October 20, 1955; and on November&nbsp; 11, 1955, he submitted&nbsp; a petition "for relief from judgment"&nbsp; (which was&nbsp; in&nbsp; effect a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; new trial under Rule 37, inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; had not yet become final),&nbsp; wherein he&nbsp; explained his/absence on the day of trial was due to accident&nbsp; or excusable neglect, because he had been attending to a&nbsp; criminal case&nbsp; before the Court of&nbsp; Appeals in&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp; The petition was&nbsp; supported by&nbsp; several&nbsp; documents&nbsp; allegedly&nbsp; showing a&nbsp; good defense.<br><br>Such petition was denied by&nbsp; order of November 16, 1955, copy of which was sent to Uera's&nbsp; counsel by registered mail.&nbsp; The latter received from the postmaster the&nbsp; first notice of such mail on&nbsp; November 28, 1955,' however, he only claimed&nbsp; and&nbsp; received&nbsp; it on&nbsp; December 20, 1955. (These two dates are important since this decision centers around them.)&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 20, 1955, he filed a motion for reconsideration,&nbsp; which was denied, copy of the denial being served him on January&nbsp; 16, 1956.&nbsp; On this last date, he tendered&nbsp; a&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; appeal, appeal&nbsp; bond and record on appeal; however, upon objection by the adverse party, the appeal was rejected&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that it was late.<br><br>Wherefore, Uera&nbsp; started&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals a special civil action praying either for mandamus to compel the judge to approve the record on&nbsp; appeal or for certiorari to set aside, on the&nbsp; ground of abuse of&nbsp; discretion, the order denying his petition for new trial.<br><br>After&nbsp; hearing both&nbsp; sides, the appellate court held: (1) mandamus may riot be granted because the appeal had not been perfected within the reglementary period; (2)&nbsp; however, the respondent&nbsp; court gravely&nbsp; abused its&nbsp; discretion in denying the motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; it set aside the judgment with directions for new trial.<br><br>At the proper time and in due form,&nbsp; the Grospes submitted to this Supreme Court a petition for review, which was given due course because they raised&nbsp; the legal issue of whether certiorari&nbsp; may be resorted to as a substitute for an appeal which could be, but&nbsp; was not, taken in time.<br><br>Uera defends the use of certiorari, and for&nbsp; good measure, he maintains the timeliness of&nbsp; his appeal.<br><br>Therefore, two questions call&nbsp; for determination:&nbsp; timeliness of the appeal and availability of certiorari.<br><br>On&nbsp; the first, we note at&nbsp; the&nbsp; outset that&nbsp; Uera has not&nbsp; appealed from the Court of Appeals' finding of tardiness of&nbsp; his&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; Admittedly, the appellee&nbsp; may differ with the appealed judgment and&nbsp; submit arguments disputing its grounds of decision; but he may do so only for the purpose&nbsp; of s<span style="font-style: italic;">upporting the dispositive part</span> of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, however, if Uera's position&nbsp; be upheld,&nbsp; the appellate court's decision will have to be overturned, and instead&nbsp; of a new trial, approval of the&nbsp; record on -appeal would have to&nbsp; be directed.<br><br>Nevertheless, overlooking this technical aspect, we have decided to look into the disputed matter to set a definite ruling.<br><br>The Grospes, the court of first instance&nbsp; and the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; made&nbsp; this computation:&nbsp; from October&nbsp; 20 (notice of decision&nbsp; received by counsel)&nbsp; up to November 11 (petition for relief or motion for new&nbsp; trial)&nbsp; 21 days elapsed; from December 3, 1955&nbsp; (notice of denial of motion)&nbsp; to December&nbsp; 20&nbsp; (motion to&nbsp; reconsider denial)&nbsp; 17 days.&nbsp; Therefore, the notice of appeal&nbsp; filed on&nbsp; January 16 was&nbsp; out of time&nbsp; (38 days&nbsp; at least).&nbsp; The herein&nbsp; respondent Uera claims, however, that the computation was&nbsp; erroneous, because the 17 days from December 3 to December 20 should not be included.<br><br>According to the&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of&nbsp; facts, notice of denial of the motion for new trial was sent to Uera's counsel&nbsp; by registered mail.&nbsp; He received <span style="font-style: italic;">the first notice,</span> from the postmaster on November 28,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp; The Grospes&nbsp; and the courts hold that Uera's counsel must be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; to&nbsp; have been&nbsp; notified on the fifth day after November 28, 1955, i.e. on December 3, 1955,&nbsp; according to Rule&nbsp; 27, sec.&nbsp; 8. On the other hand, Uera argues that he should be deemed to have been&nbsp; notified<span style="font-style: italic;"> only on December</span>&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1955, the <span style="font-style: italic;">date when he actually received the mail.</span><br><br>Sec. 8, Rule 27 reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"* * * Service by registerd mail is complete upon actual&nbsp; receipt by the addressee; but&nbsp; if he fails to claim his mail from the post office within&nbsp; five&nbsp; days from the date of first&nbsp; notice of the postmaster, the service shall take effect at the expiration of such time."<br></blockquote>Herein lies the issue: which part of the above provision controls?<br><br>The second part, in our opinion.&nbsp; Uera failed to claim his mail <span style="font-style: italic;">within five days </span>from first notice (November 28, 1955); therefore,&nbsp; he&nbsp; is deemed to have received it on December 3, 1955, no matter whether he never claimed it or received it afterwards (as&nbsp; in this case, on December 20,&nbsp; 1955).&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have held&nbsp; in several cases,&nbsp; "if&nbsp; the addressee is so negligent that he&nbsp; fails&nbsp; to claim his mail from the post office within five days after the first notice by the postmaster, then the service is&nbsp; deemed complete and effective at the expiration of such time."<br><br>It is contended&nbsp; that this second&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the sentence applies only where the addressee never&nbsp; claims&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">never receives</span> the mail.&nbsp; But the words are clear: "If he fails to claim <span style="font-style: italic;">within five days.</span>"&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not say "if he <span style="font-style: italic;">never claims</span>."&nbsp; The best proof that applies even if the addressee receives his mail&nbsp; many days after notice&nbsp; is that we&nbsp; expressly invoked it in Enriquez <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Bautista, 79&nbsp; Phil., 220 wherein the addressee actually received his registered mail on January 6, 1947, but&nbsp; we held he is deemed to have received it on November 3, 1946,&nbsp; five days after he received the&nbsp; first&nbsp; notice of the postmaster on October&nbsp; 28, 1946. Therein, we deemed the service completed <span style="font-style: italic;">on the fifth day after the first notice,</span>&nbsp; even if he <span style="font-style: italic;">actually received</span> the mail months later.&nbsp; And in Roullo <i>vs.</i> Lumayno<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> we tacitly approved identical application of section 8.<br><br>Indeed, the structure of the sentence permits no other inference.&nbsp; The second part is separated by a semicolon, and&nbsp; begins&nbsp; with "but"&nbsp; which indicates that the&nbsp; following is <span style="font-style: italic;">an exception</span> to the rule enunciated in the first that service is <span style="font-style: italic;">completed upon actual receipt</span>.<br><br>To make our thoughts specific, we may give examples: First notice of registered mail&nbsp; is received by&nbsp; addressee on December 1, and he gets his&nbsp; mail on December 3, service&nbsp; is complete on December 3, <span style="font-style: italic;">date of actual receipt</span> (first part of the&nbsp; section).&nbsp; But&nbsp; if he&nbsp; does not get it until December 15, service is deemed complete on December 6, (five&nbsp; days after December 1)&nbsp; (second part).&nbsp; If he never gets the mail, service is also deemed complete&nbsp; on December 6 (second part).&nbsp; If he receives the mail two months after it is registered, but there is <span style="font-style: italic;">no proof of the first notice</span>, actual&nbsp; receipt is the date of service (first part).<br><br>During our discussion,&nbsp; the&nbsp; possibility of injustice was explored where the mail contains a copy of the decision and the addressee gets it only on the thirtieth&nbsp; day after first notice.&nbsp; In the situation,&nbsp; and according to&nbsp; this view, the addressee would have only five days within which to perfect his appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we find no injustice,&nbsp; because&nbsp; anyway&nbsp; such party might ask the&nbsp; court for extension of&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; to&nbsp; perfect his record on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> And at any rate, if he is inconvenienced it is his fault that he did not claim his&nbsp; mail earlier, as directed by the Rules.<br><br>Furthermore, granting for the sake of argument that notice of denial of his motion for new trial was effective on December 20, as claimed by Uera, <span style="font-style: italic;">still his appeal was out of&nbsp; time.</span>&nbsp; It will&nbsp; be recalled that when he filed&nbsp; the motion for&nbsp; new trial,&nbsp; twenty-one days had already elapsed of&nbsp; his 30-day-period&nbsp; to appeal.&nbsp; Supposing he <span style="font-style: italic;">received </span>notice of denial only on&nbsp; December 20,&nbsp; yet <span style="font-style: italic;">he appealed only&nbsp;</span> on January&nbsp; 16, i.&nbsp; e. 26&nbsp; days later so 21&nbsp; days plus&nbsp; 26&nbsp; days&nbsp; equal 47 days;&nbsp; late.&nbsp; We&nbsp; know,&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 20 he&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; "motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration", but being a mere motion to reconsider, reiterating&nbsp; the motion to set&nbsp; aside, and&nbsp; on new&nbsp; ground, it did not suspend the period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Useless&nbsp; to&nbsp; urge,&nbsp; in avoidance of&nbsp; this computation, that the appeal&nbsp; was&nbsp; taken from&nbsp; the&nbsp; denial&nbsp; of the motion for new&nbsp; trial—and not&nbsp; from&nbsp; the original judgment;&nbsp; because in the first place,&nbsp; such is not&nbsp; Uera's theory, whose computation (p. 9 brief)&nbsp; begins&nbsp; from October 20, 1955,&nbsp; date when the&nbsp; original&nbsp; decision was received.&nbsp; In the second&nbsp; place, it is not permissible for one party whose appeal from the original decision has elapsed, to argue in an effort to circumvent its finality that he merely appealed&nbsp; from the order denying&nbsp; his motion for&nbsp; new trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Therefore, looked from every angle, the appeal of Uera was out of time, and&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of the court of first instance of Nueva Ecija became&nbsp; executory.<br><br>Now&nbsp; then, may compliance with such&nbsp; decision be prevented by means of certiorari?&nbsp;&nbsp; If the court had no jurisdiction, undoubtedly.&nbsp; But no: abuse of discretion is Uera's line of remedial action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too bad, certiorari is not available where such abuse could have been the object of an appeal but the time to appeal has elapsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the situation confronting&nbsp; us.&nbsp; Uera&nbsp; could have appealed, and in such appeal, discuss or insist that he should have been allowed to present his&nbsp; side, because&nbsp; accident&nbsp; or excusable neglect prevented&nbsp; him&nbsp; from attending the trial.&nbsp; Therein his pa pers supposedly&nbsp; establishing meritorious&nbsp; defenses&nbsp; could have been compared with the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs and as a result of&nbsp; the comparison,&nbsp; the appellate courts could have taken adequate&nbsp; measures.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless he did not appeal, and chose,&nbsp; designedly perhaps, to submit those papers in this certiorari proceeding, where the record does not disclose the plaintiffs' evidence and it's impossible to check his claim to a tenable stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Never was&nbsp; the rule more fitting which&nbsp; denies a separate revision through certiorari,&nbsp; to a&nbsp; party who neglected to appeal, considering especially that such neglect to appeal constituted the third of a series, the others being&nbsp; neglect to appear and neglect to claim registered mail.<br><br>True, certiorari&nbsp; has been granted&nbsp; on occasions where appeal could have&nbsp; been,&nbsp; but was not, perfected&nbsp; on time.&nbsp; But they were instances wherein the petitioner failed to appeal through accident or excusable neglect.&nbsp; And this is not one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The accident or excusable neglect described here consists in Uera's failure to <span style="font-style: italic;">appear at&nbsp; the trial;</span> not his failure to <span style="font-style: italic;">perfect the appeal</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Consequently, it&nbsp; was improper to grant certiorari. On&nbsp; that score the decision under review must be, and is hereby revoked, with costs.<br><br><i> Padilla, Bautista Angela, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See Moran, Rules of Courts,&nbsp; Comments under Rule 48, sec. 18, Saenz <i>vs.</i> Mitchell, 60 Phil., 69; Villovert <i>vs.</i> Lim, 62 Phil., 178.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Pielagio <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Generosa, 73 Phil., 654.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 103 Phil., 1044.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [4]</sup> Moya <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Barton, 76 Phil., 831.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [5]</sup> Federal Films Inc. <i>vs.</i> Judge of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; 78 Phil., 472; Medran <i>vs.</i> Court of Appeals, 83 Phil., 164;&nbsp; Mallare <i>vs.</i> Panahon, 52&nbsp; Off.

J., </b><br><br>In this&nbsp; case&nbsp; the appeal&nbsp; being sought by herein&nbsp; respondent Uera&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, wherein he&nbsp; was petitioner, from the decision of the trial court,&nbsp; wherein he was defendant,&nbsp; appears&nbsp; to&nbsp; be meritorious.&nbsp; In disposing of the alternative original&nbsp; petition for mandamus or certiorari the Court of Appeals said:<br><blockquote>"We&nbsp; note from&nbsp; the&nbsp; record&nbsp; that petitioner has a&nbsp; substantial defense in the&nbsp; action for damages filed by respondents against&nbsp; hima&nbsp; defense that ought&nbsp; at least to be receive and&nbsp; passed upon&nbsp; if justice&nbsp; is to be subserved.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges that he was the&nbsp; vendee of&nbsp; a parcel of land and&nbsp; had&nbsp; therefor become its owner.&nbsp; The land was subsequently&nbsp; mortgaged without his&nbsp; consent by the vendor, Agustin Grospe.&nbsp; Petitioner appealed to the authorities of his town and the Chief of Police, as the prosecuting officer, filed a compliant for swindling against the said vendor&nbsp; (evidently having in&nbsp; view Article&nbsp; 316&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code),&nbsp; including respondents Maxima and Tomasa Grospe as'&nbsp; co-defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue&nbsp; in the civil action for damages subsequently&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; those two against petitioner is: Was&nbsp; he guilty&nbsp; of malicious prosecution so&nbsp; as to be liable for damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; his&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial, referred to&nbsp; by him as&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition for relief from&nbsp; judgment, he submitted the documents&nbsp; already&nbsp; mentioned earlier&nbsp; in&nbsp; this decision&nbsp; tending to&nbsp; show that respondents Tomasa&nbsp; and Maxima Grospe knew of and&nbsp; authorized the mortgage of the land&nbsp; executed by their brother Agustin Grospe; that such&nbsp; authority&nbsp; was necessary for&nbsp; he mortgage because the&nbsp; land was owned by them in common; and that they knew likewise that the share&nbsp; of&nbsp; Agustin&nbsp; Grospe therein had been&nbsp; previously&nbsp; sold to petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; These&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; if allowed to&nbsp; be proven at the trial, certainly would have a material bearing&nbsp; on the question of malice imputed to petitioner.&nbsp; Material also is petitioner's allegation that&nbsp; all he did, being&nbsp; a man of very&nbsp; limited&nbsp; education, was to&nbsp; consult&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chief of Police as to&nbsp; what should be done&nbsp; to protect&nbsp; his rights to&nbsp; the property bought by him,&nbsp; and it was&nbsp; that official who decided to prosecute respondents for swindling."<br></blockquote>While&nbsp; the appeal could have been bounded upon a meritorious&nbsp; defense, it&nbsp; was not allowed by the&nbsp; trial court, because it&nbsp; was held to have been&nbsp; filed out&nbsp; of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; this point,&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"Petitioner's motion for&nbsp; new trial denominated by&nbsp; him as a petition for relief from judgment, was denied by respondent Court on November&nbsp; IS, 1955.&nbsp; Copy of&nbsp; the order of&nbsp; denial was sent to petitioner's counsel by registered mail, of which the first notice was served upon him on November 28,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp; However, it was&nbsp; not until December 20, 1955, that he claimed&nbsp; his mail and actually received said copy of the order; and on the same day he filed&nbsp; a motion for reconsideration&nbsp; thereof, which was likewise denied&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 3, 1956, copy of the order of denial being received by him on January 16, 1956. On the&nbsp; said&nbsp; dag counsel for&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; filed his&nbsp; notice&nbsp; or appeal,&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; bond&nbsp; and record on&nbsp; appeal, which was&nbsp; thereafter disapproved on the ground that they were filed&nbsp; beyond the&nbsp; reglementary period."<br><br>"The&nbsp; question raised bet-ween the&nbsp; parties is&nbsp; whether or not the appeal&nbsp; was perfected on time.&nbsp; It is admitted that&nbsp; if petitioner should be considered as having been notified of the denial of his motion for new trial only on December 20, 1955, when he actually&nbsp; claimed the registered mail containing such&nbsp; notice, his appeal would be within the prescribed period. However, it is maintained by&nbsp; the respondents that notice to petitioner was complete and effective upon the expiration of five days after November 28, 1955, and thus computed, the period of appeal had&nbsp; already expired when the record on appeal was presented."<br></blockquote>Section 8, Rule 27 of the Rules of Court says:<br><blockquote>"* * * Service&nbsp; by registered mail is complete upon actual&nbsp; receipt by the addressee;&nbsp; but if he&nbsp; fails to&nbsp; claim his mail from the post office within&nbsp; five&nbsp; days from the date of first notice of the postmaster, the&nbsp; service&nbsp; shall take effect at the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of such time."<br></blockquote>It needs no&nbsp; argument to show that notices&nbsp; are <span style="font-style: italic;">either actual or constructive:</span> registered mail is either claimed or <span style="font-style: italic;">unclaimed</span>.<br><br>In my&nbsp; opinion,&nbsp; the first part of the rule above quoted refers to&nbsp; actual notice arising from having claimed&nbsp; the registered mail; whereas, the second part, preceded by a semi-colon, concerns&nbsp; constructive notice only,&nbsp; for&nbsp; failure to claim the said mail.&nbsp; It is incongruous with reality and reason that&nbsp; a letter actually received, for&nbsp; instance,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 10th day&nbsp; from&nbsp; notice&nbsp; should be&nbsp; construed to have been received on&nbsp; the 6th&nbsp; day.&nbsp;&nbsp; To my mind, it is only when a letter is returned unclaimed that there arises the necessity of&nbsp; fixing a date for purpose of&nbsp; record and computation.&nbsp; Hence, the need of the rule on constructive notice.<br><br>To adopt respondents' contention to the contrary is to be needlessly unreasonable.&nbsp; Experience has&nbsp; shown that not infrequently addressees of registered mail, when sent&nbsp; notices, are out of town attending to some legitimate business or occupation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be grossly unreasonable and unfair to visit upon them the rigid interpretation of the rule that service&nbsp; has&nbsp; to be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; completed&nbsp; on the 6th day after first notice&nbsp; should they be&nbsp; able to&nbsp; claim&nbsp; said&nbsp; mail only thereafter.&nbsp; The first Rule of Court on the matter which took effect on January 1, 1919, follows:<br><blockquote>"Rule 13. The period within which all notifications required by these rules shall&nbsp; take&nbsp; effect, unless otherwise expressly&nbsp; provided shall be as follows:<br><br>"Five days,&nbsp; if service is made in the city of Manila,&nbsp; or the Provinces of Rizal, Cavite, or Bulacan; seven days if the service is made in any other province directly connected with Manila by any line of railroad;&nbsp; ten days if&nbsp; service is made in&nbsp; any province of Luzon not directly connected with Manila by&nbsp; any&nbsp; line of railroad, except the Provinces of Cagayan,&nbsp; Isabela, Albay, Ambos Camarines, and Sorsogon;&nbsp; twenty&nbsp; days&nbsp; if service is made in&nbsp; any province in the islands of Panay, Cebu, or Negros, or in the Provinces of Mindoro, Albay, Ambos Camarines or Sorsogon, except the Province of Antique;&nbsp; thirty&nbsp; days&nbsp; if&nbsp; service is&nbsp; made in&nbsp; any&nbsp; province of the Archipelago for which&nbsp; no shorter period is provided by this rule. Such periods shall be&nbsp; computed to&nbsp; begin with&nbsp; the&nbsp; day&nbsp; following that upon&nbsp; which the notice is served."&nbsp;&nbsp; (35&nbsp; Phil. Reports)<br></blockquote>and&nbsp; the second rule which took effect&nbsp; on April 1,&nbsp; 1933, provides:<br><blockquote>"Rule 12. Whenever&nbsp; by these rules&nbsp; a notice&nbsp; is required&nbsp; to be given by the parties, and the period thereof is not elsewhere prescribed, the time of the notice shall&nbsp; be governed by Rule 13.&nbsp; All notices&nbsp; of&nbsp; motions shall be&nbsp; given in, writing by the moving&nbsp; party to the adverse party, shall state generally the nature and grounds of the motion, and shall be&nbsp; accompanied by copies of all&nbsp; affidavits or other papers presented to the&nbsp; court&nbsp; in&nbsp; support thereof.&nbsp; Proof of the service of such&nbsp; notice shall be filed, such proof to consist of a written acceptance of the&nbsp; service, or&nbsp; the&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the person making the service that he has delivered a&nbsp; copy of&nbsp; the&nbsp; papers to the attorney for the adverse party, or has&nbsp; left it at his&nbsp; office or residence in the hands&nbsp; of some person,&nbsp; to be&nbsp; designated by&nbsp; name, employed or resident therein and&nbsp; of sufficient&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; to receive the same, or the&nbsp; certificates of a sheriff or other authorized process server that&nbsp; he has made such service.&nbsp; Service&nbsp; may also&nbsp; be made by&nbsp; sending a copy&nbsp; of the&nbsp; papers to the attorney&nbsp; for&nbsp; the adverse party by&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">registered&nbsp; mail</span>, and proof of such service&nbsp; shall be made by affidavit as to the mailing&nbsp; of the papers, and by the production&nbsp; of the registry return card or the letter unclaimed."&nbsp; (55 Phil. Reports)<br></blockquote>In any event, the&nbsp; period to claim registered mail from the&nbsp; post&nbsp; office&nbsp; is relatively short,&nbsp; as three notices&nbsp; only are sent&nbsp; to the addressee at an interval&nbsp; of three days (See Palisoc <i>vs.</i> Locsin, 57 Phil., 332; Enriquez <i>vs.</i> Bautista, 79 Phil., 220).<br><br>Apart from the foregoing&nbsp; consideration, it will be observed that the return card accompanying&nbsp; the registered mail that has been claimed, when returned to the sender, does not show the date or dates when the first or subsequent notices have been sent to the addressee. The absence of any indication as to their respective dates will give rise to a cumbersome investigation of the records of the post offices concerned so as to verify the date when the five-day period expired.&nbsp; To adopt respondents" interpretation will certainly&nbsp; create situations that&nbsp; will&nbsp; promote or&nbsp; induce protracted litigations as has happened in the case of Roullo <i>vs.</i> Lumayno, 103 Phil., 1044.<br><br>I agree with&nbsp; the majority&nbsp; that certiorari could not be availed of by respondent Uera where he had&nbsp; the remedy of appeal.&nbsp; But he should have been granted the writ of mandamus because his appeal was filed on time: the motion for reconsideration of&nbsp; the order&nbsp; denying his petition for relief suspended the running&nbsp; of the period within which to appeal,<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from should have been set aside and a writ of mandamus issued.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, J., </span>concurs, <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Decision revoked.</span></div>
