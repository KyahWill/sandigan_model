				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Ascribing grave abuse of discretion to the respondent Judge Querube
 Makalintal, the petitioner Marcelino M. Florete seeks to annul the 
order dismissing his amended complaint in Civil Case No. 2048 of the 
Iloilo Court of First Instance.
  <p>    For the purpose of this decision, simplified statement may be 
made as follows:</p>
  <p>    On September 5, 1950, the Iloilo court issued a writ of 
execution to enforce the money judgment the Luzon Surety Co. had 
obtained against Ernesto Solidum in Civil Cases Nos. 1160 and 1189 of 
the same court.  Pursuant thereto the sheriff levied, on September 22, 
1950, a definite attachment upon certain lot of Solidum that had been 
preliminarily attached on February 26, 1949.</p>
  <p>    The petitioner herein, Florete, interposed a third-party claim;
 but the sale on execution proceeded because a bond was duly filed under
 section 15 of Rule 39.  Successful purchaser at the public auction was 
Cesareo Golez for the Luzon Surety Co.</p>
  <p>    Then Florete commenced Civil Case No. 2048 to recover the land 
plus damages, alleging ownership thereof pursuant to a purchase by him 
from Dionisio Barrera, who had acquired the land from Solidum in 
September 1947.</p>
  <p>    Meanwhile as the period for redemption of the property was 
running low, herein petitioner asked the court in Civil Case No. 2048 
for an order suspending it for the duration of his complaint in said 
Civil Case No. 2048.  Even as the court denied his request, he 
repurchased the property shortly before the expiration of the one-year 
term.</p>
  <p>    Thereafter the defendants in said civil case No. 2048 lost no 
time to move fro its dismissal, contending that having received full 
satisfaction of their judgment with the redemption money paid by 
Florete, they perceived no necessity of continuing the litigation, since
 plaintiff could thereby repossesses the land<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>.  The motion to dismiss was 
granted, over the objection and request for reconsideration of Florete, 
who subsequently, formulated the instant certiorari proceedings here.</p>
  <p>    Upon careful deliberation we find that the cause must be 
dismissed, for the reason that petitioner had a plain and adequate 
remedy by appeal from the order dismissing his complaint in Iloilo.</p>
  <p>    If it were argued that his time to appeal had already lapsed 
when he submitted this certiorari petition, the reply would be that such
 circumstance does not alter the legal situation and governing principle<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>.  Otherwise, those which thru 
negligence or some other reason fail to make their appeal in time, will 
resort to special civil action to review decisions that have become 
executory due to expiration of the statutory period.</p>
  <p>    The record discloses no saving or exceptional feature.  On the 
contrary it appears that the herein petitioner acquired this land in 
August 1948, i. e. after a <i>lis pendens</i> (case No. 1160) had been 
duly noted in March 1948, on the corresponding certificate of title at 
the request of Luzon Surety Company.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore this petition is dismissed with costs.  So ordered.</p>
