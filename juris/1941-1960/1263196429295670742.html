That the plaintiff,&nbsp; by&nbsp; reason of the&nbsp; accident met&nbsp; by his&nbsp; said son, Winston. Ortaliz, as above-stated, through the&nbsp; fault, negligence and recklessness&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Segundino&nbsp; Estanda&nbsp; for&nbsp; whose&nbsp; acts the defendant&nbsp; is responsible because he was at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; employed&nbsp; by him (defendant)&nbsp;&nbsp; as his driver,&nbsp; has also&nbsp; suffered, because&nbsp; of the mental anguish, fright, serious&nbsp; anxiety, wounded feelings and&nbsp; moral shook,&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages&nbsp; in&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; TWO&nbsp; thouâˆ§&nbsp; PESOS (F2,000), Philippine Currency;<br><br>"10.&nbsp; That&nbsp; the&nbsp; boy, Winston&nbsp; Ortaliz, was strong, robust and happy&nbsp; before&nbsp; the accident that caused&nbsp; on him&nbsp; physical&nbsp; Injuries which necessitated his hospitalization&nbsp; and medical&nbsp; attention, and was not suffering nor had he&nbsp; ever suffered from&nbsp; any illness;<br><br>"11.&nbsp; That demands have been&nbsp; made on the&nbsp; defendant to pay the&nbsp; plaintiff the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P2,446.55 for&nbsp; actual,&nbsp; consequential and moral damages, but the defendant&nbsp; refused and. still refuses to pay the&nbsp; same,&nbsp; and that by reason&nbsp; of the refusal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendant, the plaintiff was forced&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; the services of an attorney paying the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P500.</blockquote><br><br>"Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that a decision be rendered;<br><br><blockquote><ol><br><li> Sentencing-&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of F2,-146.55 for the&nbsp; actual,&nbsp; consequential and&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages&nbsp; plus&nbsp; an additional&nbsp; sum of P50O for attorney's fees;<br><br></li><li> To pay the costs of&nbsp; this suit, and<br><br></li><li> Plaintiff&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted any&nbsp; other remedy that is just and equit- able and proper in law."</li></ol></blockquote>On March 18, 1953, the defendant-appellee filed a&nbsp; motion to dismiss wherein, after&nbsp; admitting the ownership of the Studebaker Sedan&nbsp; car&nbsp; with plate&nbsp; No. 35-1138, he&nbsp; alleged the following:<br><blockquote>" (a)&nbsp; That&nbsp; the case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar is&nbsp; one for&nbsp; recovery of&nbsp; damages arising from the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of Slight&nbsp; Physical Injuries&nbsp; as borne&nbsp; out by the allegations of&nbsp; the complaint itself.<br><br>"(b) That defendant&nbsp; is&nbsp; being sued&nbsp; in his&nbsp; capacity as&nbsp; the&nbsp; employer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; perpetrator&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; said crime, Segundino&nbsp; Estanda, and,&nbsp; as deducible from&nbsp; the allegations of the complaint,&nbsp; for defendant's supposed subsidiary civil&nbsp; liability&nbsp; arising therefrom under the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>"(d)&nbsp; That&nbsp; the complaint does&nbsp; not allege that defendant was nor&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; any&nbsp; business&nbsp; or industry in&nbsp; conjunction with which he&nbsp; has&nbsp; at any time used&nbsp; the said&nbsp; car, much less&nbsp; on&nbsp; the occasion of&nbsp; the alleged&nbsp; accident,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; that defendant bad at any time put out the&nbsp; said car&nbsp; for hire.<br><br>"(e)&nbsp; That&nbsp; the&nbsp; obligation or liability of defendant, if&nbsp; any,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; damages alleged in&nbsp; the complaint, being&nbsp; an obligation arising from a&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; offense, is governed&nbsp; by Article 1161 oC the Civil Code,&nbsp; which, in turn, makes the penal laws&nbsp; applicable thereto.<br><br>"(f)&nbsp; That, under&nbsp; Article 103&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, it&nbsp; is essential,&nbsp; in order&nbsp; for&nbsp; an employer to&nbsp; be liable subsidiarily&nbsp; for felonies committed&nbsp; by his&nbsp; employee,&nbsp; that the former be engaged in some kind of industry,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the employer had&nbsp; committed the crime&nbsp; in&nbsp; the discharge of Ms&nbsp; duties&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with such industry.<br><br>"(g) That,&nbsp; therefore, defendant cannot "be held subsidiarily liable for the crime committed by his driver&nbsp; as&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; plaintiff's complaint.<br><br>"PREMISES CONSIDERED,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; respectfully prays&nbsp; this Hon. Court to dismiss the complaint,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same having failed to state a cause of action, with costs." <br><br>Thereafter the parties&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; memoranda on whether the complaint&nbsp; failed to state a cause of action and the Court, after&nbsp; taking into consideration the arguments advanced by the parties, dismissed the complaint.</blockquote>Plaintiff now contends that under paragraph 2 of Article 2884 of the&nbsp; Civil Code and paragraphs&nbsp; 1 and 5 of Article 2180,&nbsp; a sufficient cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action has been&nbsp; clearly alleged in the&nbsp; disputed complaint&nbsp; and therefore the same&nbsp; should not have&nbsp; been&nbsp; dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 2180&nbsp; in part provides:<br><blockquote>"Art. 2180.&nbsp; The obligation imposed by artiele 2176 is demandable not only for&nbsp; one's&nbsp; own acts&nbsp; or&nbsp; omissions, but also&nbsp; for those of persons for whom one is responsible.<br><br>"Employers shall be liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; damages caused by their employees&nbsp; and household&nbsp; helpers&nbsp; acting: "within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the&nbsp; former are&nbsp; not&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; any business or industry." </blockquote><br><br>and Article&nbsp; 2184 in its&nbsp; last&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; provides:<br><br><blockquote>"If the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; was not in the motor vehicle, the&nbsp; provisions of Article 2180 are&nbsp; applicable." </blockquote>Having in view&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforequoted&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; law and those&nbsp; of&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 2176&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect that&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoever&nbsp; by act or omission&nbsp; causes damage&nbsp; to&nbsp; another, there&nbsp; being fault&nbsp; or&nbsp; negligence, is obliged&nbsp; to pay for&nbsp; the damage done",&nbsp; there seems to be&nbsp; good&nbsp; reason to support&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiff's contention&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; in question&nbsp;&nbsp; states sufficient&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant-appellee, however, claims that&nbsp; there is no allegation in the complaint that "the&nbsp; defendant was engaged in some&nbsp; kind of&nbsp; industry and that the employee had&nbsp; committed the crime&nbsp; in the discharge of his duties in connection with such industry," hence&nbsp; the defendant cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; held&nbsp; subsidiarily&nbsp; liable for the crime committed by&nbsp; his&nbsp; driver and therefore the complaint&nbsp; failed to&nbsp; state facts sufficient to constitute&nbsp; a cause of action.&nbsp; But paragraph&nbsp; 5 of Article 2180 refutes this contention for&nbsp; it clearly provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; "Employers shall be&nbsp; liable for the damages caused&nbsp; by their employees acting within&nbsp; the&nbsp; scope of&nbsp; their assigned&nbsp; tasks,&nbsp; <i>even though the former are not&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; any&nbsp; business&nbsp; or industry."</i><br><br>Defendant-appellee also contends that when the&nbsp; judgment in&nbsp; Criminal Case No. 2607 of the&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Bacolod was rendered&nbsp; against&nbsp; the driver Segundino Estanda,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; did not&nbsp; reserve the&nbsp; civil&nbsp; action and thus he lost his right thereto and consequently the present action&nbsp; against the defendant-appellee would&nbsp; not lie.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention,&nbsp; however, is untenable, for Article 33&nbsp; of the Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; clearly provides:<br><blockquote>"Art. 33. In cases of physical injuries, a civil&nbsp; action for damages, entirely separate&nbsp; and&nbsp; distinct&nbsp; from the criminal&nbsp; action, may&nbsp; be brought by&nbsp; the&nbsp; injured party.&nbsp; Such civil&nbsp; action&nbsp; shall proceed independently of&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal prosecution, and shall require only a preponderance&nbsp; of evidence."</blockquote>Wherefore, the order of dismissal entered by the&nbsp; lower court is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; revoked and the case remanded&nbsp; to said court for further proceedings.&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
