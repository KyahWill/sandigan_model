				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Laguna denying the petition for naturalization filed by&nbsp; the petitioner-appellant,&nbsp; Manuel Li Kwong.<p></p><p>The trial court,&nbsp; in denying the petition for naturalization, called attention to the facts&nbsp; (1) that the&nbsp; appellant made a wrong choice of jurisdiction, in that while it was alleged in&nbsp; the petition that the appellant is a resident of Baños, the evidence consisting of his marriage certificate, income tax returns, and residence certificate, shows that his residence is in&nbsp; Manila; (2)&nbsp; that while he claimed to be a Catholic, it turned out that he is&nbsp; an Aglipayan;&nbsp; (3) that while he claimed to have twelve employees in his printing press, without any Chinese employee, an&nbsp; ocular inspection made&nbsp; by the&nbsp; court&nbsp; showed that the printing press was not in operation and there were&nbsp; only four Filipinos and one Chinaman;&nbsp; and (4) that although he claimed to have an annual&nbsp; income of P50,000, he had a bank account of only P2 while his wife had a bank account of only P38 thereby&nbsp; casting a&nbsp; doubt as to&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; solvency.</p><p>The Solicitor General in his brief&nbsp; concurs with the appellant in contending that the grounds invoked by the trial court are untenable.&nbsp; Even so, he recommends affirmance of the appealed&nbsp; decision on the sole&nbsp; ground that there is no sufficient evidence to prove that the petitioner has not been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.</p><p>We agree with both the appellant and the Solicitor General in their view that the court<em> a quo</em> erred.&nbsp; With reference to the matter of residence, it may be stated that the record shows that the petitioner has&nbsp; since 1931 lived with his wife in Los Baños, Laguna, although he goes to Manila every day in connection with his business, thereby being absent from&nbsp; his&nbsp; family residence only in&nbsp; the day time. The statement in the marriage contract, residence certificate and income tax returns&nbsp; to the effect that the&nbsp; appellant was a resident of Manila&nbsp; is not conclusive and cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the appellant, corroborated by his witnesses, that his residence is in Los Banos, especially considering the fact that there is absolutely no showing that the appellant owns or is renting a residential home in Manila.&nbsp; We have held in the case&nbsp; of Pajo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Borja, Vol. 47, No. 1 (1951) Off. Gaz., page 310, that&nbsp; a residence&nbsp; certificate is&nbsp; not truly what its&nbsp; name implies, "a certificate of&nbsp; residence"; it is more properly an&nbsp; "identification&nbsp; certificate" for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; the place and date of birth and civil status&nbsp; are required&nbsp; to&nbsp; be placed therein, and&nbsp; these circumstances identify the holder, and for the further reason that the law requires it to be exhibited as a&nbsp; means of identification before a government department, branch or office, or before notaries public.&nbsp; It is obvious that Manila was mentioned in the income tax returns merely because he has his business there.</p><p>In connection with appellant's claim that he has an annual income of P50,000, it is to be remembered that he asked the permission of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court to amend his pleading by alleging&nbsp; that said&nbsp; income&nbsp; was&nbsp; meant&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; gross, as actually&nbsp; shown by&nbsp; the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; This petition to amend was denied by the trial courts and we believe erroneously. The amendment&nbsp; should have been allowed conformably to the Rules of Court so as to make&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegation in the pleading agreeable&nbsp; to the facts proven.</p><p>As&nbsp; to&nbsp; appellant's solvency, the record shows&nbsp; that he has as annual net income of about P7,000.&nbsp; The fact that at the time the court make an&nbsp; ocular inspection of appellant's printing press, only four Filipinos and a Chinaman were&nbsp; found&nbsp; therein, is&nbsp; not sufficient&nbsp; to overcome&nbsp; the positive&nbsp; evidence to the effeet&nbsp; that appellant's&nbsp; income is more&nbsp; or&nbsp; less&nbsp; P7,000, not to mention&nbsp; the circumstance that he owns one-half of the house where he is living in Los Baños costing about P15,600,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same being conjugal property, although in the name of his wife.&nbsp; The number of employees which the appellant has in his printing press, alleged by him to&nbsp; be eleven, is&nbsp; borne out&nbsp; by the corresponding report&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Labor,&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; "P". Upon the other&nbsp; hand the bank balances in&nbsp; favor of the petitioner and the latter's wife, are not a correct index as to the annual income.</p><p>We are constrained to overrule the objection interposed by the Solicitor General that tends to support the appealed decision, namely, that there is no sufficient proof that the appellant has not been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that the present petition for naturalization was unopposed, and the appellant positively testified that he has never' been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude.&nbsp; It is true that ordinarily clearances from the proper authorities are presented&nbsp; in evidence, but there is no law to that effect, with the result that the uncontroverted evidence presented by the appellant on the point has to be given weight.&nbsp; Moreover, the clearances referred&nbsp; to by the&nbsp; Solicitor General have in this instance been.incorporated into the record, and although they cannot be legally considered&nbsp; as formal evidence,&nbsp; they tend at least to satisfy a&nbsp; requirement insisted upon by the Solicitor General but not imposed by&nbsp; law.</p><p>Wherefore, the appealed decision&nbsp; is reversed&nbsp; and the petition for naturalization&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by the petitioner-appellant is&nbsp; hereby granted So ordered without costs</p><p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. </em>L., and&nbsp; <em>Endencia, JJ., concur.</em></p></div>
