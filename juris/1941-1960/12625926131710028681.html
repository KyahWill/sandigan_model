				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Solicitor General, in representation of&nbsp; the Government, seeks&nbsp; the reversal of the&nbsp; decision of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; granting&nbsp; the petition of&nbsp; the appellee&nbsp; for naturalization, on the ground&nbsp; that the&nbsp; trial court erred (1) in finding that the petitioner-applicant has complied&nbsp; with&nbsp; all the requirements&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law; (2)&nbsp; in finding&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioner has&nbsp; all the qualifications for the grant of Filipino citizenship; and&nbsp; (3) in granting him such citizenship. " &nbsp;<br><br>Carefully considered, the evidence of record fully justifies the&nbsp; following findings of fact of the&nbsp; trial court: <br><blockquote>"That the petitioner was&nbsp; born,&nbsp; in&nbsp; Chingkang, China, on&nbsp; May 5, 1914; that he came to the Philippines&nbsp; for the first time in&nbsp; 1932, arriving at tile Port of Manila on&nbsp; board the vessel '<i>Ang Kian</i>,' and has continuously resided&nbsp; in the Philippines—except&nbsp; for short trips to China in 1946 and in 1948, where he stayed each time for less than&nbsp; a year, and then to Hongkong in 1950 and in 1952, where he stayed each time for less&nbsp; than a month, but returning to the Philippines after each of those trips—and&nbsp; in the City of Manila for a term&nbsp; of one year at least immediately&nbsp; preceding the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; the filing' of the petition; that at present, ho is living at No. 362 Camba St., San Nicolas, Manila; that he&nbsp; was engaged in the importation business&nbsp; in the&nbsp; year 1950 and&nbsp; 3951, from which&nbsp; he&nbsp; derived an average annual&nbsp; income&nbsp; of P6,000,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that since&nbsp; 1953 up to&nbsp; the present he&nbsp; is employed as agent of Ong&nbsp; Sing with an annual salary of P2,400;&nbsp; that he is married to&nbsp; Chua Sio Ha who was born in Chingkang, China, by whom he&nbsp; has two children, namely, Ong Yok Him and Luz Ong, both born also in Chingkang, China, on November 5, 1947 and on December 16, 1949, respectively; that his wife and two children have never visited the Philippines, as they&nbsp; continuously resided up to the present in Chingkang, China;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; two children are not enrolled in&nbsp; any school&nbsp; because&nbsp; they&nbsp; are not yet of school age;&nbsp; that he can speak&nbsp; and write English and Tagalog; that he believes in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution; that he has&nbsp; conducted himself in a proper&nbsp; and irreproachable&nbsp; manner during the entire period&nbsp; of&nbsp; his residence in the Philippines in his relations with the constituted authorities and with the community in which he is living;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; has mingled socially&nbsp; with Filipinos and has evinced a sincere desire to&nbsp; learn and embrace their customs, traditions and&nbsp; ideals; that he is not opposed&nbsp; to organized government or affiliated with any association&nbsp; or group of persons who uphold and teach doctrines opposing&nbsp; all organized governments; that he&nbsp; is not defending or teaching&nbsp; the necessity&nbsp; or&nbsp; propriety of violence, personal&nbsp; assault or assassination for the success and predominance of men's ideas; that he is&nbsp; not a polygamist nor a believer in&nbsp; the practice of polygamy; that&nbsp; he has not been&nbsp; convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; is not suffering from&nbsp; any&nbsp; incurable contagious&nbsp; disease;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; nation of which he is a citizen or, subject&nbsp; (Nationalist Republic of&nbsp; China) is not&nbsp; at war with&nbsp; the Philippine; that it is his intention in good faith to become a citizen of ,the Philippines&nbsp; and to renounce&nbsp; absolutely and forever&nbsp; all&nbsp; allegiance&nbsp; and fidelity to&nbsp; any foreign&nbsp; prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, particularly to&nbsp; the Republic of China&nbsp; of which&nbsp; at this time he is a citizen or subject;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he has resided continuously in the Philippines from the date of the filing of this petition up to the present time, and will do so up to the time of his final admission as Filipino citizen;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; he&nbsp; has not heretofore made&nbsp; or filed any petition for citizenship with&nbsp; any other court.<br>&nbsp;<br>"The petitioner presented as his&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; former Congressman Cesar Miraflor and&nbsp; Assistant City Fiscal Pedro Asis, Jr., of Manila, who testified that they have&nbsp; known the&nbsp; applicant for&nbsp; more than ten years; that&nbsp; to their personal knowledge, the petitioner has been and is a person of good repute and morally irreproachable, attached to the&nbsp; principles underlying the&nbsp; Philippine Constitution and well disposed to the good order&nbsp; and happiness of the Philippines; and that they recommend the petitioner to become a Filipino citizen." </blockquote>Under the first assignment of error, it is&nbsp; contended&nbsp; by the Solicitor&nbsp; General&nbsp; that the&nbsp; case should&nbsp; be dismissed because&nbsp; there was no&nbsp; due&nbsp; publication of&nbsp; the notice&nbsp; of hearing&nbsp; as required in section 9&nbsp; of the Revised Naturalization Law, for said notice&nbsp; was only published once&nbsp; in the Official Gazette No.&nbsp; 7, Vol.&nbsp; 49,&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in July,&nbsp; 1953, and therefore&nbsp; the&nbsp; requirement of&nbsp;&nbsp; the law&nbsp; that said&nbsp; notice should be published once a week for three consecutive weeks in the Official&nbsp; Gazette has not&nbsp; been complied with.&nbsp; The notice of&nbsp; hearing was, however,&nbsp; published once&nbsp; in the Official&nbsp; Gazette and for three&nbsp; consecutive&nbsp; weeks&nbsp; in the Voz de&nbsp; Manila, <i>viz</i>.; on&nbsp; July 28, August 2 and August 8 of 1953, and the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; why it has not been published for three consecutive weeks in the Official&nbsp; Gazette was that it&nbsp; is now published&nbsp; monthly and&nbsp; not weekly; hence the appellee&nbsp; contends that there&nbsp; has been a&nbsp; substantial compliance with the law&nbsp; in regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; the publication of the notice of&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; in&nbsp; the present case and therefore the application should&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted. <br><br>Section 9 of&nbsp; the Revised Naturalization&nbsp; Law provides as follows: <br><blockquote>Sec. 9.&nbsp; Notification and appearance. Immediately upon the filing' of a petition, it shall be the duty of the clerk&nbsp; of the court&nbsp; to publish the same at petitioner's expense, <i>once a week for three consecutive weeks, in the&nbsp; Official Guzette</i>, and in one of the newspapers of general circulation&nbsp; in&nbsp; the province "where the petitioner resides, and to have copies of said petition&nbsp; and a general notice&nbsp; of the hearing be posted in a public and conspicuous place in his office&nbsp; or in the&nbsp; building&nbsp; where said office is located, setting forth in such notice the name, birthplace and&nbsp; residence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioner, the date&nbsp; of his arrival in the&nbsp; Philippines, the&nbsp; name of the&nbsp; witnesses whom the petitioner proposes to&nbsp; introduce in support of his petition, and the date of&nbsp; the hearing of the petition, which hearing shall not be held within ninety days&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of the last publication of the&nbsp; notice.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *" </blockquote>It could be&nbsp; seen&nbsp; that, under the&nbsp; aforequoted&nbsp; section&nbsp; of the Revised Naturalization&nbsp; Law, the&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; of the application&nbsp; for citizenship should be&nbsp; published&nbsp; three y&nbsp; times&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Official&nbsp; Gazette, or, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; language of the law, "once a week for <i>three</i> consecutive weeks and so&nbsp; in&nbsp; the order. of publication of the&nbsp; notice of hearing of the present case, it was enjoined that the same be made&nbsp; "once a week for <i>three</i> consecutive weeks in the Official Gazette and in the Voz de Manila."&nbsp;&nbsp; The notice of hearing of this case should therefore&nbsp; have been published three times not only in the&nbsp; Voz&nbsp; de Manila&nbsp; hut in the Official&nbsp; Gazette&nbsp; as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there being&nbsp; only one&nbsp; publication of said notice of hearing in this&nbsp; case&nbsp; the Official Gazette,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same is clearly&nbsp; incomplete&nbsp; and therefore&nbsp; insufficient&nbsp; to confer&nbsp; jurisdiction to the&nbsp; court <i>a quo</i> to try the case and&nbsp; grant the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; argued,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; that there has been it&nbsp;&nbsp; a substantial&nbsp; compliance with law&nbsp; because&nbsp; the notice&nbsp;&nbsp; of hearing in question was&nbsp; published three times in the <i>Voz&nbsp; de Manila</i> and once in the.&nbsp; Official Gazette;&nbsp; but since the&nbsp; law expressly&nbsp; provides that the notice of hearing&nbsp; be published three times, this should&nbsp; be strictly observed, for, as correctly pointed out by the Solicitor General in his&nbsp; brief, <br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; publication required by law in the&nbsp; Official&nbsp; Gazette and in a newspaper of&nbsp; general circulation is a means of screening aliens applying for Filipino citizenship by giving&nbsp; the public&nbsp; a chance to come&nbsp; forward and protest&nbsp; the grant of such citizenship if&nbsp; they possess&nbsp; any information&nbsp; derogatory to the&nbsp; applicant.&nbsp; The&nbsp; official organ of the government&nbsp; caters to&nbsp; the officials&nbsp; and employees of the government&nbsp; and to the lawyers as well.&nbsp; These people, by reason of their&nbsp; occupation&nbsp; are&nbsp; in&nbsp; a better position to acquire knowledge of aliens running afoul of the&nbsp; law than&nbsp; the average reader who scans the newspaper for news.&nbsp; If the law was. not after the number of times the notice&nbsp; is published&nbsp; in the Official Gazette, it could have expressed in plain words that a single publication in the Official Gazette&nbsp; would suffice;&nbsp; but&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; law&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; provides&nbsp; its publication 'once a week&nbsp; for&nbsp; 3 consecutive&nbsp; weeks' the&nbsp; intention to give the reading public 3 chances&nbsp; to&nbsp; read that item is very clear. A single publication therefore of the&nbsp; notice&nbsp; whore the&nbsp; law requires 3 is an&nbsp; incomplete&nbsp; publication, and&nbsp; an incomplete publication is not a&nbsp; valid&nbsp; publication.&nbsp; The grant&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; citizenship&nbsp; is&nbsp; only a&nbsp; mere privilege,&nbsp; and a strict compliance with law&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part of the applicant is essential."</blockquote> Petitioner may contend, however, that the law provides that&nbsp; the publication&nbsp; of&nbsp; the notice of hearing&nbsp; should&nbsp; be made for&nbsp; <i>three&nbsp; consecutive&nbsp; weeks</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; as&nbsp; the- Official Gazette is now being published&nbsp; monthly,, and not weekly as it was&nbsp; before,&nbsp; petitioner cannot actually comply with law;&nbsp; and because he had the notice of hearing&nbsp; in question published,&nbsp; once, in the Official&nbsp; Gazette, he should be&nbsp; given the benefit of&nbsp; having followed the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; contention does not merit&nbsp; serious consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is true that the notice&nbsp; of hearing&nbsp; in question&nbsp; cannot actually be published for&nbsp; three&nbsp; consecutive weeks&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Official Gazette, it is&nbsp; no less true that said notice may be published&nbsp; <i>three times</i> consecutively, although not weekly, in the Official Gazette, and&nbsp; because the true&nbsp; intent of&nbsp; the law is&nbsp; that the said notice be&nbsp; published 3&nbsp; times, it is our considered opinion that in the instant case the single publication of the notice of hearing in question is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a sufficient compliance with law.<br><br>And in view of the foregoing considerations,&nbsp; we find&nbsp; it unnecessary to discuss the question raised in the second assignment of error. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is hereby reversed and the petition dismissed without prejudice,&nbsp; with costs against the appellee. <br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Reyes,&nbsp; J.
