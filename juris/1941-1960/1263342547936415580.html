				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> On May 5, 1955,&nbsp; the special administrator filed a&nbsp; petition in court for&nbsp; authority to pay&nbsp; the accounting firm of Sycip, Gorres, Velayo &amp; Co. the sum of P3,650,&nbsp; for services rendered in taking&nbsp; inventory of assets in&nbsp; 1950, tax&nbsp; consultations&nbsp; in 1950&nbsp; to 1954,&nbsp; and&nbsp; preparation of&nbsp; income tax returns for 1953&nbsp; and 1954.&nbsp; The court below&nbsp; denied this motion, on the ground that the&nbsp; services covered by the fees&nbsp; of the&nbsp; accounting firm&nbsp; were rendered&nbsp; to the former&nbsp; special administrator Philippine Trust Company. Upon being notified of the denial of the special&nbsp; administrator's petition to pay it, the accounting firm appeared in court and&nbsp; asked for the reconsideration of the order of denial.&nbsp; Opposition to this&nbsp; motion for reconsideration was filed by heirs Teresa, Carmen, Consuelo, Manuel, Elena and&nbsp; Alfredo,&nbsp; all surnamed&nbsp; Palanca y&nbsp; Cuartero, on the following grounds: as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fees&nbsp; for services in the taking of the inventory in 1950, Mr. Ozaeta, who asked for said services, was not yet the special&nbsp; administrator when said services were rendered;&nbsp; the tax consultations from 1950 to 1954 cover years in which Mr.&nbsp; Ozaeta was not yet the special administrator, and&nbsp; as&nbsp; the same&nbsp; was rendered during the incumbency of the Philippine Trust, the fees should be paid for by&nbsp; Mr. Ozaeta himself.&nbsp; After various arguments, the court refused&nbsp; to&nbsp; grant&nbsp; the&nbsp; re- consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; its original order&nbsp; denying the&nbsp; petition, and&nbsp; so&nbsp; appeal therefrom&nbsp; was&nbsp; taken to this Court.<br><br>Since the pendency of the case in court, the oppositors-appellees have presented a withdrawal of their opposition, on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; they have already assigned&nbsp; their rights, titles&nbsp; and participations&nbsp; in the said estate to the eight children of Rosa&nbsp; Gonzales&nbsp; Vda. de Palanca, and no longer have any&nbsp; interest in the&nbsp; estate,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; do they have any&nbsp; personality to further intervene in the proceedings. A similar motion has also&nbsp; been filed&nbsp; by Sebastian&nbsp; Palanca, who states that he has transferred his&nbsp; share to the inheritance to Carlos Palanca, Jr.&nbsp; For their part. Rosa Gonzales&nbsp; Vda. de Palanca and&nbsp; her&nbsp; eight children have&nbsp; filed a statement expressing conformity to the payment of the fees.<br><br>The withdrawal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; objections notwithstanding,&nbsp; it seems&nbsp; that it is still necessary to&nbsp; decide&nbsp; the.&nbsp; questions raised, i.e., whether the services rendered to&nbsp; the special administrator named in the will, previous&nbsp; to his actual appointment&nbsp; as&nbsp; such and&nbsp; at his instance, are chargeable against the estate.<br><br>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; question .that the&nbsp; services&nbsp; rendered were for the benefit of the estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rules require&nbsp; that the administrator should submit an inventory of the properties of the&nbsp; estate within&nbsp; three months from his appointment (Sec.&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 84, Rules of&nbsp; Court).&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Ozaeta expected&nbsp; to be appointed&nbsp; administrator of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; immediately, in view of his&nbsp; designation&nbsp; as&nbsp; executor&nbsp; of the will of&nbsp; the&nbsp; decedent, it was&nbsp; proper,&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; and expedient&nbsp; for&nbsp; him, even before&nbsp; his actual appointment, to employ&nbsp; the&nbsp; services&nbsp; of&nbsp; accountants&nbsp; in&nbsp; order&nbsp; that&nbsp; they can&nbsp; prepare the accounts&nbsp; or&nbsp; the inventory in due&nbsp; time and within&nbsp; the period&nbsp; prescribed by the&nbsp; Rules.<br><br>The&nbsp; general&nbsp; rule&nbsp; is that&nbsp; acts&nbsp; done by&nbsp; an executor in the interest of his trust,&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; his qualification as such, become binding on the estate upon his&nbsp; qualification (Baker vs. Cauthorn,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; 55&nbsp; N. E.&nbsp; 963).&nbsp; In&nbsp; the said&nbsp; case the court held:<br><blockquote>"It&nbsp; is contended by appellant&nbsp; that the&nbsp; services&nbsp; rendered by appellees were to the said James E. Baker before he actually became the executor of decedent's will, and that said Baker&nbsp; is individually liable for the value of whatever&nbsp; services were&nbsp; so&nbsp; rendered, and not said estate. It is not contended&nbsp; that appellees were&nbsp; not retained, nor that the&nbsp; advice was not given, nor that the&nbsp; services were not of the value&nbsp; of $100,&nbsp; but&nbsp; the sole contention&nbsp; seems to be that, because the actual work which was done occurred prior to "the time appellant&nbsp; in fact qualified as executor, said&nbsp; Baker was individually liable,&nbsp; and appellees had no&nbsp; claim against the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; which he (Baker) was representing. x x x x x x<br><br>"We think&nbsp; the evidence sustains the&nbsp; finding and judgment of the lower court.&nbsp; It shows that the services rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; appellees were connected&nbsp; with the settlement&nbsp; of his decedent's estate.&nbsp; There was no special agreement between&nbsp; James E. Baker and&nbsp; appellees that they were to look to the estate&nbsp; alone for payment; hence they&nbsp; could, if they so&nbsp; desired, look to said James&nbsp; E.&nbsp; Baker personally for the value&nbsp; of such services.&nbsp; Long&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Rodman,&nbsp; 58 Ind.&nbsp; 58.&nbsp; Appellees "waived the right to hold said James E.&nbsp; Baker personally and elected to hold the estate, for the value&nbsp; of such services. x x x.&nbsp; After the executor&nbsp; has qualified,&nbsp; Ms&nbsp; authority over the decedent's property reaches back to&nbsp; the time of the decedent's death, and&nbsp; covers all acts done&nbsp; by him in the interest' of his trust. Gilkey m; Hamilton, 22&nbsp; Mich. 283.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the evidence in this case, we think the executor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; will oil&nbsp; Nancy&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Baker could&nbsp; have the&nbsp; claim of appellees, and rightfully insisted upon its allowance as a&nbsp; credit in his settlement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the trust.&nbsp; Not&nbsp; having done&nbsp; this, the only "way open to appellees to secure payment for their&nbsp; services from the trust fund&nbsp; was to file his claim&nbsp; against the estate,&nbsp; and&nbsp; proceed as&nbsp; the record&nbsp; shows&nbsp; they&nbsp; have done.&nbsp; We find no error in the record."&nbsp; (Baker vs, Cauthorn, et al.,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>, pp. 963-964.)</blockquote>The services tendered in the years 1953-1954 were also as&nbsp; useful to&nbsp; the estate as those rendered&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with&nbsp; the&nbsp; preparation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the inventory.&nbsp; Whoever&nbsp; may have&nbsp; contracted the services of the accountants, whether it was Mr. Ozaeta before his appointment or the Philippine&nbsp; Trust,&nbsp; such services&nbsp; were&nbsp; for the benefit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate and have redounded to&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate's&nbsp; benefit.<br><br>For&nbsp; the foregoing considerations, the order denying payment&nbsp; to the firm of&nbsp; Sycip, Gorres, Velayo&nbsp; &amp; Co, of the sum&nbsp; of P3,650 is hereby&nbsp; reversed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the authority for the payment of&nbsp; the same by the special&nbsp; administrator from the funds&nbsp; of the estate is hereby&nbsp; granted.&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
