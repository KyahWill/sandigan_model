				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On November 28, 1956, Special Prosecutor Baldomero M. Villamor
presented an information in the Court of First Instance of Manila in
Criminal Case No. 38164, containing the following allegations:<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That in and during the period from June 16, 1949 to
April 28, 1956, and for sometime prior and subsequent thereto, in the
City of Manila, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the above-named accused * * * and others whose identities and
whereabouts are still unknown, who consented, allowed and/or permitted
the aforesaid acts of falsification, to wit: On Back Pay Form No. 1 and
the Processing Questionaire, the accused stated under oath, among other
things, that on December 1 to 8, 1941, they were connected with or
employed in the Labor and Farmer Battalions, CEA, in such capacity or
position and with such rate of compensation, more particularly
described hereunder: * * * on the supporting affidavits attached to
Back Pay Form No. 1 and the plantillas required by prescribed
regulations, accused Alejandro Salazar, Ruperto Cristobal, Aurelio
Intertas, Artemio C. Nabor, Jesus Niñonuevo, Emiliano Lazaro, Marcelo
Garcia and Igmedio Salazar <em>alias</em> Igmedio Mabanta, attested to
the employment of the accused enumerated in TABLE I in the Labor and
Farmer Battalions, CEA, from December 1, 1941 to January 3, 1942, more
particularly described hereunder: * * * when in truth and in fact, as
said accused well knew, the accused enumerated in table I were never in
anyway connected with or employed in the Farmer and Labor Battalions,
CEA, of the Department of Labor, in their above-stated capacity or
position, and therefore were not entitled to any back pay, thereby
making false statements in a narration of facts; that after the said
acts of falsification had been committed as" above-described, the said
accused Alejandro Salazar, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully
and feloniously planned and induced the said accused Bonifacio Gabriel,
Florentino M. Villaflor, Andres Suñga, Emiliano Lazaro, Igmedio Salazar
<em>alias</em> Igmedio Mabanta, Pretestato Navarra, and others
previously accused with pending cases before the Court of First
Instance of Manila, as enumerated in TABLE I with intent to defraud, to
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously present and file, as in fact they
did present and file, the said documents with the Treasurer of the
Philippines, in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,
thereby succeeding in securing Acknowledgments of Back Pay in their
favor and receiving partial redemptions, in conspiracy and
confederation with accused * * * to the damage and prejudice of the
Republic of the Philippines, in the total amount of thirty-three
thousand THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN FESOS and EIGHT CENTAVOS
(P33,377.08) Philippine Currency."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the filing of the information, the prosecution filed a motions
with the court, asking that Andronico Duque, Andres Sunga and
Florentino Villaflor be discharged from the information to be utilized
as state witnesses in accordance with Section 9, Rule 115 of the Rules
of Court. I It is alleged in the motion that there is absolute
necessity for the testimonies of the said accused whose discharge is
requested; that there is no other direct evidence available for the
prosecution of the complex offense committed, except the testimonies of
the said accused; that the testimonies of said defendants can be
substantially corroborated on its material points; that the defendants
do not appear to be the most guilty; that the accused have not at any
time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude.</p>
<p>Accused Aurelio Intertas, through counsel, Atty. Vicente Francisco,
immediately filed an opposition to the above motion. In the memorandum
filed by him, it is argued that the motion shows that persons sought to
be discharged have convicted themselves of the offense charged, as well
as of perjury, and that there is no need for their testimonies as the
same are worthless and because direct evidence is available. It is
further argued that the accused sought to be discharged are major
figures in the case. The prosecutor answered this opposition, stating
that the backpay claimants were induced to participate in the
commission of the offense by the alleged mastermind, Alejandro Salazar,
in conspiracy with other principal figures including accused Aurelio
Intertas; hence the three accused sought to be discharged are not the
most guilty. He also stated that the alleged presence of direct
evidence is incorrect, as the prosecution would not seek to discharge
the three accused if it were in possession of said evidence, and it did
not specify the corroborative evidence for it is a matter of evidence
which is not to be alleged in the information. Furthermore, he claims
that in accordance with the case of U. S. <em>vs.</em> Abanzado, 37
Phil., 664, a trial judge must necessarily rely upon the information
furnished by the prosecuting officer in coming to the conclusion that
the testimonies of the accused sought to be discharged are necessary.
After a rejoinder to the reply of the special prosecutor was filed, the
trial court entered the following order:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"As may be gleaned from the arguments of the parties
and especially by the citation of documentary evidence made by the
accused Intertas, it is crystal clear that the said accused Andronico
Duque, Andres Suñga and Florentino Villaflor were claimants for the
collection of their backpay. They had made sworn applications to that
effect. They answered under oath the processing questionnaires required
for the approval of claims and made affidavits and sworn statements
regarding the same. As a consequence of the said applications,
questionnaires and sworn statements the said accused were able to have
their applications approved and to collect backpay which according to
them they were entitled. Later on they made sworn statements stating
that what they have stated in their applications, questionnaires and
affidavits were not true.</p>
  <p>"In view of these circumstances,
said accused Andronico Duque, Andres Suñga and Florentino Villaflor are
guilty of falsification of public documents and the said documents are
direct evidence against them for the crime that they have committed. *
* *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In consequence, the court denied the motion. Against the denial the
prosecution has come to us after a denial of its motion for
reconsideration, alleging that the ruling of the trial judge denying
the motion is not justified.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the law, Rule 115, Section 9, does not
disqualify an accused sought to be discharged as witness for the State
merely on the ground that he has committed a falsification himself, or
that he had actually committed the crime charged. The rules says that
it is necessary that "the said defendant does not appear to be the most
guilty," from which the conclusion follows that the guilt of an accused
of the crime charged is no reason why he may not be excluded as witness
for the State. As a matter of fact, the candid admission of an accused,
of his participation in a crime, is a guaranty that if he will testify
in court he will testify truthfully; so that even if an accused
actually participated in the offense charged in the information, he may
still be made a witness. Individuals who are candid enough to admit
their guilt are expected to testify truthfully and it is from that
circumstance that all the facts involved shall be expected to be
truthfully disclosed by him.</p>
<p>The reasoning used by the trial court in its order would render
impossible the prosecution of persons guilty of the offense charged,
especially when aside from those who are charged of the crime, none can
be secured to testify against the most guilty, as in the case at bar.
Such a reasoning would render the above Rule 115, Section 9, impossible
of compliance, because the accused who are charged as guilty may not be
excluded for the purpose of testifying for the State and against their
co-accused. The ground underlying the rule is not, to let a crime that
has been committed go unpunished; so an accused who is not the most
guilty is allowed to testify against the most guilty, in order to
achieve the greater purpose of securing the conviction of the more or
most guilty and the greatest number among the accused permitted to be
convicted for the offense they have committed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, we declare that the order appealed from constitutes an
abuse of discretion of the judge below, and said order is hereby set
aside. Let the proceedings below continue in accordance with this
ruling. Without costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C.  J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista  Angelo, Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>,  concur.</p></div>
