				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a&nbsp; petition to review the decision of the Court of Industrial Relations of February 27, 1958 (in Case No. 3-ULP), finding the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; guilty. of&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; labor practice under the&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On June 30,&nbsp; 1953, the&nbsp; respondent union filed with the above-mentioned court a complaint for alleged unfair labor practice committed by the petitioner, in that he locked out from employment 46 drivers, members of the respondent union,&nbsp; on June 27, 1953.<br><br>Before filing his answer,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; asked for&nbsp; the dismissal of&nbsp; the complaint on the grounds&nbsp; that the court had no jurisdiction over the person&nbsp; of the petitioner and the subject matter of the action, and the respondent union was not the real party in interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner claimed that there existed no employer-employee relationship between the&nbsp; petitioner and the&nbsp; drivers,&nbsp; members&nbsp; of the respondent union, the relationship being one of lessor and lessee only, as the jeeps being used by the said&nbsp; drivers were rented&nbsp; out by the&nbsp; petitioner under&nbsp; the&nbsp; so-called "boundary system".&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion was denied by the&nbsp; court in its order of February 16, 1954, but on petitioner's motion for reconsideration, the court,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">en&nbsp; banc</span>,&nbsp; in its resolution of June&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1954, unanimously reconsidered&nbsp; its first order and finally&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that there&nbsp; was no employer-employee&nbsp; relationship between the parties.<br><br>The respondent union, appealed to this Court,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on March 23, 1956, we rendered a decision&nbsp; (in G. R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-7945)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>&nbsp; reversing the said&nbsp; resolution and holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; an employer-employee relationship existed between&nbsp; the parties. The said&nbsp; decision&nbsp; became&nbsp; final on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1956.<br><br>In view of the decision&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Court, the petitioner, on June 4, 1957, filed in&nbsp; the court <i>a quo</i> his answer to the complaint of June 30, 1953, denying (1)&nbsp; the legitimacy of the respondent union, and&nbsp; (2) the charge of unfair labor practice,&nbsp; claiming that he acted in good faith based&nbsp; on his honest&nbsp; belief that he was&nbsp; not an&nbsp; employer&nbsp; of the drivers, members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; union,&nbsp; but&nbsp; only a lessor of&nbsp; his&nbsp; jeepneys.<br><br>Thereafter, the&nbsp; case was&nbsp; heard,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on February&nbsp; 27, 1958, the court&nbsp; rendered a&nbsp; decision, as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"It would appear that&nbsp; the main question at issue is whether&nbsp; the respondent &nbsp; has committed the charges alleged in the complaint.<br><br>"According to the&nbsp; complaint, the respondent had knowledge of the&nbsp; formation of a&nbsp; union on June 26, 1953 and respondent upon learning of the&nbsp; same decided on dismissing all the driver members because he&nbsp; did not want to have a union within his company. This particular&nbsp; union, it turned&nbsp; out, was a chapter or affiliate of&nbsp; the complainant union which was organized sometime on June 24, 1953.<br><br>On June 27, 1953, the respondent dismissed the drivers&nbsp; appearing in the&nbsp; complaint by&nbsp; refusing&nbsp; them&nbsp; the use of&nbsp; the jeepneys regularly assigned to them.<br><br>"On the other hand, respondent claims otherwise.&nbsp; The respondent, it is alleged, fearing&nbsp; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; strike might&nbsp; be called by the&nbsp; drivers decided on not renting out the jeepneys on said&nbsp; date, June 27, 1953.<br><br>"Based on the versions submitted in evidence&nbsp; by the parties, it is clear that the respondent engaged in&nbsp; the unfair&nbsp; labor&nbsp; practice charged in the complaint,&nbsp; amounting to a&nbsp; virtual lockout of his employee drivers, hence constituting discrimination&nbsp; under Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 875.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; records of this case disclose, the&nbsp; act of locking out committed by respondent was made without the required notice and&nbsp; no collective bargaining negotiations&nbsp; were ever made. The&nbsp; mere suspicion by respondent, that a&nbsp; strike might&nbsp; be called by the union, is no justification for such&nbsp; an act.<br><br>"We hold therefore, that respondent is guilty of the unfair labor practices charged in the complaint.<br><br>"However, there are certain aspects&nbsp; of this case which&nbsp; merit&nbsp; consideration.&nbsp; It&nbsp; has been contended by respondent, since the beginning of this case, that he is not the employer of the,drivers listed in the complaint&nbsp; and&nbsp; has&nbsp; honestly acted under such belief.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; very Court itself, unanimously were of the same&nbsp; opinion that&nbsp; there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; employer-employee relationship.&nbsp; In the application of the&nbsp; affirmative reliefs&nbsp; granted by&nbsp; law,&nbsp; this&nbsp; good faith of the respondent must be taken&nbsp; into consideration in those portions where the&nbsp; law allows&nbsp; this Court to&nbsp; use its sound discretion and judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The particular portion we have in mind&nbsp; is section&nbsp; 5 of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 875.<br><br>"Furthermore, it appears that some of&nbsp; the drivers listed in the complaint&nbsp; have either returned to work&nbsp; or are already&nbsp; working elsewhere and there is a need for further proceedings in this respect.<br><br>"IN VIEW&nbsp; OF THE FOREGOING, this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; hereby orders the respondent:<br><br>"(1)&nbsp; To cease&nbsp; and desist&nbsp; from&nbsp; further&nbsp; committing the unfair labor practices complained of;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>"(2)&nbsp; To reinstate&nbsp; the drivers&nbsp; listed in&nbsp; the complaint,&nbsp; except those who have been already reinstated;<br><br>"(3)&nbsp; To pay back&nbsp; wages&nbsp; to&nbsp; all the drivers&nbsp; listed in&nbsp; the complaint, but in the&nbsp; exercise of&nbsp; the Court's discretion said back wages shall commence only&nbsp; from May 29,&nbsp; 1956, based&nbsp; on the&nbsp; minimum daily wage&nbsp; of&nbsp; P4.00, deducting&nbsp; therefrom&nbsp; and&nbsp; from said date&nbsp; the periods when said drivers have&nbsp; found substantially equivalent&nbsp; and regular employment&nbsp; for themselves, for which reason further hearings shall be had&nbsp; for the sole purpose&nbsp; of determining the respective amount of back wage? due each&nbsp; driver&nbsp; up&nbsp; to the time they are actually re-employed&nbsp; by respondent.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<br></blockquote>On March 8, 1958, petitioner filed&nbsp; a motion for reconsideration&nbsp; which was denied by the court&nbsp; in&nbsp; its resolution <i>en banc</i>, of July 30, 1958.&nbsp; Hence, this petition for review.<br><br>It is the contention of respondent union that petitioner, upon learning that his drivers had&nbsp; formed&nbsp; a labor union among themselves, refused on June 27, 1953, to let them use and&nbsp; operate the jeepneys regularly assigned to them, which act, it is alleged,&nbsp; constitutes an unlawful lockout and an unfair labor practice.<br><br>The petitioner,&nbsp; on the other&nbsp; hand, claims that he did not lock out his drivers, members of the respondent union, on June 27,1953, as contended by them.&nbsp; Believing honestly that no employer-employee relationship existed between him and them and fearing that the drivers were intending to declare&nbsp; a strike and might abandon his jeepneys&nbsp; in the streets of the city, he decided, as a precautionary measure to protect his interest,&nbsp; to suspend their operation temporarily&nbsp; and&nbsp; consult his attorney.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; obtaining his counsel's advice, he immediately announced to the drivers the following morning, June&nbsp; 28, that they could then take out his jeepneys.&nbsp;&nbsp; While some four or five of them heeded petitioner's request, the others refused to return to operate. Those who took advantage of petitioner's offer had however, to come back after a few hours because some&nbsp; of the drivers on strike had admonished them to return the jeepneys and join the strike.&nbsp; For&nbsp; some days&nbsp; this situation continued. until on October&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1953, when&nbsp; the&nbsp; case was first submitted for decision, thirty-four (34) of the forty-six&nbsp; (46)&nbsp; drivers had already returned&nbsp; to work under the same conditions as&nbsp; before&nbsp; June 27, 1953.<br><br>We have examined the records and we are satisfied that . what occurred on June 26,&nbsp; 1953, and&nbsp; the days following was&nbsp; substantially as testified to by petitioner&nbsp; Benedicto Dinglasan and his witnesses, three of whom&nbsp; are among the drivers of his jeepneys, two&nbsp; (Julio Ongpin and Francisco Lea√±o) are completely disinterested persons, two are patrolmen, and the remaining two are his employees, as against the sole testimony of Juanito Cruz,&nbsp; President of the local group of the respondent labor union, and on the essentially hearsay declaration of&nbsp; Zosimo Yjares&nbsp; who&nbsp; claims to be the&nbsp; secretary&nbsp; of the drivers' association.<br><br>While we agree&nbsp; with the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; that the act of the petitioner&nbsp; in suspending the operation of his jeepneys on June 27, is&nbsp; legally&nbsp; and technically not in&nbsp; consonance with the Industrial Peace&nbsp; Act (the court <i>a quo</i> termed it "a virtual&nbsp; lockout") so as to entitle the drivers&nbsp; to be reinstated,&nbsp; nevertheless, as the trial court correctly&nbsp; stated in its decision,<br><blockquote>"there are certain aspects of&nbsp; this case which merit consideration. It has been&nbsp; contended&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent, since the beginning of this case, that he is&nbsp; not the employer of the drivers listed in the&nbsp; complaint and has honestly noted&nbsp; under such belief.&nbsp; This very Court itself, unanimously were of the same&nbsp; opinion that there was no employer-employee relationship. In the application of the affirmative reliefs granted by law, this good faith of the respondent must be taken into consideration in&nbsp; those portions where&nbsp; the law allows this court to&nbsp; use its sound discretion and judgment.&nbsp; The particular portion we have&nbsp; in mind is Section 5 of Republic Act No. 875."<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; the exercise of this&nbsp; discretion, that&nbsp; is,&nbsp; whether the reinstatement will be with&nbsp; or without back pay, aside from the fact that there was no willful violation of the Industrial Peace Act, there is an additional circumstance that may be considered in favor of herein&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; As already mentioned above, petitioner, the day&nbsp; following his suspension of the operation of the jeepneys, urged the&nbsp; drivers to return and resume&nbsp; the work,&nbsp; notwithstanding which, the latter not only&nbsp; refused, but even compelled those who&nbsp; did, to join the strike.&nbsp; It is clear therefrom, that the&nbsp; cessation&nbsp; or&nbsp; stoppage of the&nbsp; operation after&nbsp; June&nbsp; 27, was not the direct&nbsp; consequence of petitioner's locking them up or of any willful unfair or discriminatory act of the former, but the result of their (the drivers) voluntary and deliberate refusal to return to work.&nbsp; Taking into account the foregoing&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; and&nbsp; considering their similarity to those&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of Philippine&nbsp; Marine Radio Officers' Association <i>vs.</i> Court of Industrial Relations et al.,&nbsp; 102 Phil., 373, wherein&nbsp; it was held that there is no reason for granting backpay if there&nbsp; has not been any willful unfair labor practice or refusal of the respondent companies to admit&nbsp; their laborers back to work, while the drivers members of respondent&nbsp; union may, in this case, be entitled to reinstatement, we find no&nbsp; justification for their receiving back wages for the&nbsp; period&nbsp; that they themselves refused to return to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Wherefore, the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp; accordingly modified in the sense that the reinstatement will be without back pay.&nbsp; In all other respects, the same is affirmed, without costs.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered. <br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Endencia,</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Gutierrez&nbsp; David,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Republic Act No. 875.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> National Labor Union <i>vs.</i> Dinglasan, 98 Phil., 649; 52 Off.
