				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Alejandra Darang, registered owner of lot No. 842 of the Cadastral
Survey of Rosales, Pangasinan, as evidenced by Original Certificate of
Title No. 31699 in the land records of said province, died intestate in
1935, survived by her husband, Pedro Cabangcala, and five minor
children. Some two years after her death, Severo Domingo filed a
petition in the cadastral case (G.L.R.O. Rec. No. 706), alleging that
the aforementioned lot had been sold to him by the deceased during her
lifetime for P500 but her sudden death had prevented her from making
good her undertaking to execute the corresponding deed for purposes of
registration, and praying that, after notice by publication and after
hearing, the Register of Deeds of Pangasinan be ordered to cancel
Original Certificate of Title No. 31699 and issue a transfer
certificate to petitioner and his wife Sofia Arreola. Acting on the
petition, the court had it set for hearing on a given date and had
notice of the hearing given by publication. But as no one appeared to
contest the petition, the court received petitioner's evidence and
granted the order prayed for, and the order was in due time implemented
by the register of deeds.<p></p>
<p>About ten years thereafter, or on April 8, 1949, the children of the
deceased Alejandra Darang filed an action in the Court of First
Instance of Pangasinan, asking for the annulment of the order above
mentioned and for reinstatement of the original certificate of title in
the name of. the deceased on the ground that the court that rendered
the said order was without jurisdiction, this on the theory that a
Court of First Instance when acting as a land registration court has no
authority to adjudicate issues that should be ventilated in an ordinary
civil action. Plaintiffs also prayed that they be declared owners of
the land in question and that defendant be condemned to pay them
damages for the occupation of the land since November 2, 1939.
Maintaining the validity of the sale made to him by the deceased and
the proceedings had for the transfer of title, defendant in addition
pleaded prescription, alleging "that the right of action of the
plaintiffs to question the sale had already expired." </p>
<p>Upon hearing the cause, the court rendered judgment upholding the
sale and the proceeding had for the transfer of title and dismissing
the complaint with costs. From this judgment plaintiffs appealed to the
Court of Appeals, but that court has certified the case here on the
grounds that the questions presented are legal and raise an issue of
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>As we see it, the question of jurisdiction is decisive of the case.</p>
<p>Section 57 of the Land Registration Act provides that an owner
desiring to convey in fee his registered land shall execute a deed of
conveyance, which, for purposes of registration, the grantor or grantee
may present to the register of deeds in the province where the land
lies together with the grantor's duplicate certificate of title; while
section 127 says that such deed of conveyance shall be signed by the
person executing the same in the presence 'of witnesses and
acknowledged before a notary public or any of the officers mentioned in
that section. The Act thus requires, for purposes of registration, a
deed of conveyance in proper form. As the grantor in the present case
died before she could fulfill her promise to execute the proper deed,
it is obvious that the remedy of the grantee, if he wanted the sale
registered and the title transferred to him, was through an action to
compel the heirs to fulfill the promise. But instead of following this
obvious procedure, the grantee sought to have the transfer of title
made through the procedure indicated in section 112 of the Land
Registration Act. As has been repeatedly declared by this court
(Castillo et al., vs. Ramos,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> 45 Off. Gaz., 183; Miraflor vs. Leano et al.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span>
G.R. No. L-6097) that procedure is not intended for the adjudication of
questions properly pertaining to an ordinary civil action such as the
question of whether the alleged contract of sale was really entered
into or whether the same came under the Statute of Frauds. Moreover,
the section requires "notice to all parties in interest," and in the
present case the children of the deceased (plaintiffs herein) were not
notified or even named in the petition, to say nothing of the fact that
plaintiffs were then minors with no guardian ad litem having been
appointed to represent them. The court thus did not acquire
jurisdiction over the persons of those who should have been made
parties to the case (the heirs of the deceased). For this and for like
want of jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action, the order
rendered by the court was void <em>ab initio</em> and could be annulled at any time.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the
proceedings and orders complained of annulled, and the Register of
Deeds of Pangasinan ordered to cancel the transfer certificate of title
issued to the appellee and reinstate the original certificate of title
in the name of the deceased. With costs against the appellee.</p>
