				<H3>MARIA JOSEFA DE LA PAZ FABIE AND JOSE CARANDANG, PETITIONERS, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS AND NARCISO MORDENO, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Owing to the alleged refusal of the Court of Appeals to follow our applicable 
decisions, due course was given to this petition for review on certiorari.
<p>The facts and issues are simple: During the Japanese occupation plaintiff 
Maria Josefa de la Paz Fabie delivered to defendant Narciso Mordeno a piece of 
realty in Pasay, Rizal, by virtue of a written contract entitled "Agreement of 
Sale with Right to Repurchase." Therein the vendor reserved the right to 
repurchase the property within the period of "three months from and after the 
termination of the war at present raging * * * ." On April 8, 1946 Maria Josefa 
offered to repay the money she had received on account of the sale, but 
defendants refused to accept, claiming her time to repurchase had already 
passed.</p>
<p>Wherefore a complaint was filed on May 24, 1947 in the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal for the return of the premises upon payment of the amount 
received by Josefa. Plaintiffs (husband and wife) based their demand upon two 
propositions: first, the contract was a mortgage, and they were ready to redeem; 
second, even if it were a pacto de retro sale, she had exercised her option 
within the appointed time.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance gave judgment for plaintiffs upholding their 
right to repurchase, for the equivalent amount of P375.00, adjusted to the 
Ballantyne scale. Defendant took the matter to the Court of Appeals; and a 
division therein reversed the adjudication, expressing the opinion that the 
compact was a true pacto de retro, the redemption period of which had already 
expired when Josefa tendered payment in April 1946, inasmuch as the war had 
terminated on February 27, 1945 when General McArthur turned over the Government 
of these Islands to President Osmeña in Malacañan Palace, or at the latest, on 
September 2, 1945, when the document of formal surrender was signed by Japanese 
representatives on board the U. S. battleship "Missouri" at Tokyo Bay.</p>
<p>Requested to apply General <em>vs</em>. Venecia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 178 Phil., 780. 44 Off. Gaz., 4912 wherein 
we ruled that in July 1947 a promissory note had not yet matured because it was 
payable "within six months after peace has been declared."</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals declined, making a distinction between "termination of 
war" and "proclamation of peace," and quoting authorities to the effect that war 
terminates when hostilities cease.</p>
<p>The General case, involved a constant referring expressly to declaration of 
peace; and it is not clearly erroneous to deny its application where parties to 
another contract (as in this litigation) refer to termination of war, without 
express reference to "peace". However, Raquiza <em>vs</em>. Bradford,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 178 Phil., 780. 41 Off. Gaz., No. 7, p. 
262 which was cited in General <em>vs</em>. Venecia, clearly stated that in 
September 13, 1945 the war <em>had not yet terminated</em>, because war, in the 
<em>legal sense</em> continues until, and terminates at the time of, some 
<em>formal proclamation of peace</em> by an authority competent to proclaim it. 
That view was reaffirmed in Yamashita <em>vs</em>. Styer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 178 Phil., 780. 42 Off. Gaz., 664 and in 
Untal <em>vs</em>. Chief of Staff, 47 Off. Gaz., 1147. Such holding is amply 
sustained by additional authorities quoted in petitioners' brief.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals copied several decisions to sustain its view that, as to 
private contracts, war ends "when hostilities cease." These are some such 
pronouncements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is a line of decisions which hold that war does not end with the 
cessation of hostilities but continues until peace treaties are signed and 
ratified or peace is formally proclaimed. The existence of war and restoration 
of peace, according to these authorities, are political questions determined by 
the legislative and executive departments and such determination is conclusive 
and binding on the courts. See Palmer <em>vs</em>. Pokorney, 217 Mich. 284, 186 
N.W. 505; Meier <em>vs</em>. Schmidt, 150 Neb. 383, 24 N.W. 2d 400, 403, 404; 
Industrial Commission of Ohio <em>vs</em>. Rotar 124 Ohio St. 418, 179 N.E. 135; 
Waller <em>vs</em>. United States Ct. CI., 78 F. Supp. 816, and citations; Woods 
<em>vs</em>. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U.S. 138, 68 S. Ct. 421, 92 L. Ed. 596, 
and citations; 56 Am. Jur., War, section 13; 67 C. J., War, sections 
195-197.</p>
<p>However there is an impressive array of authority which supports the trial 
court's decision that, as commonly understood and especially <em>where the 
parties to a contract so intend</em>, war ends when hostilities cease. See 
Keiser <em>vs</em>. Hopkins, 6 Cal 2d 537, 58 p. 2d 1278, 1279; Supp. Hotel 
Operating Co. <em>vs</em>. Donn. 158 Pla, 541, 29 So. 2d 441 (involving a lease 
for the duration of the present World War); * * * (Darnell <em>vs</em>. Day 37 
N.W. 2d 277)."</p>
<p>"Similarly, where private contracts are in terma limited to the 'duration of 
the war,' the courts have generally held that the meaning of that phrase is to 
be decided by <em>determining the intent of the parties</em>, * * *. However 
there is some authority holding that, despite the clear intent of the parties to 
the contrary, such a contract remain in force until peace is formally restored. 
Palmer <em>vs</em>. Pokerny, supra." (Italics is ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It should be observed that the same authorities specifically qualify the rule 
with "where the parties to a contract so intend," or by "determining the intent 
of the parties".</p>
<p>Supposing therefore that the above enunciate the binding principle as to 
contracts, it appears from the same, and the citations therein, that war 
terminates when peace is formally proclaimed, <em>except</em> where the parties 
<em>have intended otherwise</em> and meant mere cessation of hostilities—in 
which case their intention must be given effect.</p>
<p>Indeed, an annotation (1947) in vol. 168 American Law Reports p. 173 et seq. 
on the meaning of "end of war" in a contract reaches the conclusion, after 
review of the cases, that the determination of the question depends upon the 
intent of the parties.</p>
<p>Logically, an exception to the general rule must be proven by adequate 
circumstances, facts, declarations etc. None is described in the decision now 
under scrutiny, and none may be cited to support or require a declaration that 
Maria Josef a de la Paz Fabie and Narciso Mordeno <em>actually intended</em> 
mere cessation of hostilities as termination of the war.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the short period of three months indicates both parties 
contemplated the return of complete normalcy, not merely the end of armed 
conflict, for everybody knows that the months and years after such ending, are 
periods of reconstruction and economic hardship.</p>
<p>Anyway, in this jurisdiction the language of a writing is to be interpreted 
according to the <em>legal meaning</em> it bears in the place of its execution" 
* * * (Rule 123 sec. 58) and as stated in the Raquiza, Yamashita and Untal 
cases, the war terminates <em>in a legal sense</em>, upon official proclamation, 
of peace.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly in April 1946 (when the offer to repurchase was made) no peace 
treaty had been signed between the United States and Japan, and no formal 
declaration of peace had been published (President Truman issued his 
proclamation in December 1946). Therefore, in that month (April 1946) 
plaintiffs' period for repurchase had not yet passed.</p>
<p>Error was thus committed in the Court of Appeals on this major point, which 
error constituted the basis of this petition for the reversal of its decision 
and consequent confirmation of the judgment of the Court of First Instance. And 
as the appellee Mordeno ascribed no other mistake to said inferior court (he 
filed no brief and did not appear at the oral argument);</p>
<p>The decision under review is hereby reversed, and the judgment of the court 
of First Instance affirmed, with costs against respondent Narciso Mordeno. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador Concepcion</em>, and<em> 
Reyes, J.B,L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>
