				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for review of a decision of the Court of Appeals 
modifying that of the court <i>a quo </i>"in the sense that defendant is not bound to 
pay the plaintiff the sum of P2.341.69 as expenses incurred by the latter in 
connection with the installation of the hemp press in its plant, and that upon 
refund of the purchase price of this machine and of the corresponding legal 
interest theraon, plaintiff shall allow defendant to get back the hemp preys 
bought from him in the same condition as it was when delivered."<p></p>
<p>The facts as found by the Court of Appeals are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On March 10, 1949, Co Cho Chit entered a contract with Hanson, Orth &amp; 
Stevenson, Inc., in virtue of which the latter bought from the former one hemp 
press, furnished With marine type reversible clutch; hemp box guide made of 
angular steel and beltings to the main drive power engine' for the sum of 
P8,000.00, which the buyer paid the purchaser under the terms and conditions 
stipulated in the contract of sale (Exhs. A &amp; 1), one of which was that the 
vendor would furnish free of charge the services of a competent mechanic to 
supervise the installation of the above hemp press and turn same over to the 
purchaser in satisfactory running order, as well as the mechanic to supervise 
the installation of the power drive engine to be furnished by the purchaser for 
said hemp press. As per letter of Co Cho Chit of March 10, 1949, to Hanson, Orth 
&amp; Stevenson, Inc. (Exhs. A-l &amp; 4), the vendor further guaranteed that 
the said hemp press would give satisfactory service under reasonable use of the 
same for a period of six months, excepting breakage of any part thereof due to 
careless handling by buyer's operators.</p>
<p>"In consonance with the contract and letter aforementioned, said hemp press 
was shipped to, and installed at, plaintiff's Fiber Plant in Davao City under 
the supervision and direction of the vendor's mechanics, though in spite of all 
efforts and cooperation given by the purchaser, the same has never been up to 
the present in a satisfactory running order, nor could it give satisfactory 
service, because it could not compress and turn out hemp bales to regulation 
size of 12 cubic feet each, or less, in accordance with Section 9, paragraph (d) 
of Fiber Inspection Administration Order No. 5, nor has the vendor ever turned 
over said hemp press to the buyer as provided in said contract.</p>
<p>"By reason of such vendor's alleged failure to comply with his aforementioned 
obligations, the purchaser demanded from him the refund of the sum of P8,000.00 
paid as purchase price of the hemp press, and as Co Cho Chit refused to yield to 
this demand, Hanson, Orth &amp; Stevenson, Inc., instituted on October 13, 1949, 
the corresponding complaint that gave rise to this action in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila against Co Cho Chit, praying in the complaint that this 
defendant be sentenced to refund said sum of P8,000.00 to the plaintiff and to 
further pay the latter the following sums: (1) P2,341.68 spent for freight, 
loading and forwarding charges of the hemp press and for materials and labor in 
the installation of the same at purchaser's Fiber Plant in Davao City and for 
the transportation, board and lodging of defendant's mechanic who supervised and 
directed the installation of the hemp press as well as the power drive engine 
mentioned in said contract; (2) P2,400.00 paid by the purchaser to Arsenio Siy 
as rentals for the warehouse located in Davao City for the months of July and 
August, 1949, that is, after the period that the vendor had to finish the 
installation of the hemp press and the said power engine as per the contract; 
and (3) the sum of P100.00 a month as compensation for the safekeeping of the 
aforesaid hemp press in purchaser's Davao Fiber Plant from July 1, 1949, until 
the said hemp press be removed therefrom.<br><br>"The defendant answered the 
complaint setting affirmative defenses and denying that the hemp press is not in 
a satisfactory-running order; that it does rot give satisfactory service; that 
it does not press and turn out hemp bales in government regulation size; and 
that it has net been turned over to the plaintiff by the defendant, and prayed 
the court to dismiss the complaint, with costs against plaintiff, praying 
further for such other remedy as the court may deem just and equitable in the 
premises.</p>
<p>"As on November 29, 1950, plaintiff Hanson, Orth &amp; Stevenson had sold, 
transferred, conveyed and assigned unto Conrad &amp; Co., Inc. its claims and 
cause of action in this case, the latter applied for the substitution of the 
former in this litigation, which substitution was approved by order of the court 
of May 14, 1951. After hearing the court rendered judgment, the dispositive part 
of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby renders judgments in favor of the 
plaintiff and against the defendant, declaring the contract rescinded and 
ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff the amounts of P8,000.00 and 
P2,341.69, the purchase price and the expense incurred by it for the 
unsatisfactory installation, respectively, with interest at the rate of 6% per 
annum from the date of the filing of the complaint until fully paid. With cost 
against the defendant."'</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>From this decision the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals which 
modified the same as stated above. Petitioner now contends that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED ON A QUESTION OF LAW WHEN, IN EFFECT, IT HELD 
THAT UNDER THE CONTRACT APPELLANT BOUND HIMSELF ON A WARRANTY THAT THE HEMP 
PRESS WOULD RENDER 'SATISFACTORY' SERVICE IN THE SENSE THAT 'THE PRESS COULD BE 
USED, AFTER INSTALLATION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPELLEE'S BUSINESS OF EXPORTATION 
OF HEMP'—</p>

<p>"(a) THERE BEING NO EXPRESS WARRANTY IN THAT SENSE,</p>
<p>"(b) THERE BEING NO IMPLIED WARRANTY AS CONTRACT WAS FOR THE SALE AND 
DELIVERY OF A SPECIAL HEMP PRESS,</p>
<p>"(c) EVIDENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES TENDING TO VARY TERMS OF A WRITTEN CONTRACT 
BEING BARRED BY THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE FROM CONSIDERATION BY THE COURT, 
AND<br><br>"(d) THERE BEING NO CASE OF WARRANTY AGAINST HIDDEN DEFECTS, THE 
DEFECTS COMPLAINED OF BEING NOT HIDDEN DEFECTS AND THE VENDEE NOT HAVING RELIED 
UPON THE KNOWLEDGE OR SKILL OF VENDOR."</p></blockquote>
<p>The contract that was concluded between the parties relative to the sale of 
the hemp press in question is embodied in the letter of March 10, 1949 sent by 
petitioner to respondent which, for purposes of reference, we quote 
hereunder:</p>

<p>In connection with the aforequoted contract, the Court of Appeals also 
considered as important the statement made in 'another letter which says: "In 
connection with the said hemp press, we guaranty same to give 
satisfactory-service under reasonable use of same for a period of six months, 
excepting breakage of any part thereof due to careless handling by your 
operators" (Exhibit A-l). And considering the terms of the two letters in 
relation to the rest of the evidence, the Court of Appeals made the following 
findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is to be also noted in this connection that J. Deane Conrad who carried 
oat the transaction with Co Cho Chit, is not a mechanic, while the vendor is the 
head, if not the owner, of Grace Park Engineering; that Hanson, Orth &amp; 
Stevenson. Inc., for which the hemp press was bought, needed this machine in the 
operation of its business of exporting hemp from the country; that with the 
exception of a very small percentage, almost all of the hemp produced in the 
Philippines is for exportation; that since its installation the hemp press in 
question has not been able to bale hemp of regulation size for exportation; and 
that because of this failure or defect plaintiff has never accepted said hemp 
press. Such being the case, and even if the terms of the contract do not 
specifically or expressly bind defendant to make the installation of the hemp 
press but only to furnish the service of competent mechanics to supervise the 
installation thereof, yet this hemp press had to be installed under the 
supervision of the personnel of the defendant and had 'to give (after 
installation) satisfactory service under reasonable use of same for a period of 
six months, excepting breakage of any part thereof due to careless handling by 
plaintiff's operators; and such service could not be 'satisfactory if the hemp 
press could not be used, after its installation, in accordance with appellee's 
business of exportation of hemp. In the case at bar, the failure in carrying" 
out the installation in question may not be a basis for rescission of the 
contract Exhibit A, but even so, there still would be ground for the resolution 
thereof if one of the parties thereto fails to fulfill his part of the 
contract."<br><br></p></blockquote><p>From the above findings, the following appears clear; that 
respondent, for which the hemp press was bought, needed this machine in the 
operation of its business of exporting hemp from the country; that with the 
exception of a very small percentage, almost all the hemp produced in the 
Philippines is for exportation; that since its installation, the hemp press in 
question has not been able to bale hemp of regulation size for exportation; and 
that because of this failure or defect, respondent has never accepted said hemp 
press. For this reason, the court concluded that petitioner breached his 
contract and so respondent is entitled to its rescission.</p>
<p>The letter-contract Exhibit A shows clearly that petitioner obligated himself 
to perform only two obligations, to wit: first, to sell and deliver to 
respondent the described hemp press, and, second, to furnish free of charge the 
services of a competent mechanic to supervise the installation of the hemp press 
and turn the same over to respondent in satisfactory running condition. In 
addition, it may be said, considering the clarifying letter Exhibit A-l, that 
petitioner guaranteed that the hemp press would "give satisfactory service under 
reasonable use of same for a period of six months." It would appear that these 
commitments of petitioner were complied with, since the hemp press as described 
was delivered, the same was installed to respondent's satisfaction, and it is 
giving satisfactory service under reasonable use for the purpose for which it 
was made. There is nothing in the record to show that the hemp press delivered 
is not in accordance with the specification contained in the contract, nor is 
there any point raised that it is not functioning for the purpose for which it 
was made. Such being the case, it would seem that petitioner has done his part 
in the contract and therefore there Is no reason why it should be rescinded to 
his prejudice. Of course, in the clarifying contract Exhibit A-1, petitioner 
guaranteed that the hemp press would give satisfactory service under reasonable 
use for a period of six months, but this guaranty cannot be interpreted to mean 
that the hemp press would press hemp in bales of any specified size or according 
to the regulation size needed for exportation. Said guaranty only means that the 
hemp press would give satisfactory service if reasonably used for the purpose it 
was made, and this purpose is the one described in the contract.</p>
<p>It is true that the hemp press is not able to bale hemp of regulation size 
for exportation which is the purpose respondent want to be, but why is it that 
such brand of press was not specified in the contract? Why is it that it was not 
clearly expressed therein that the hemp press needed by respondent was intended 
to bale hemp in connection with its business of exportation? The record shows 
that J. Deane Conrad, who carried out the transaction with petitioner, is a 
responsible official who has-had enough experience in the business of hemp and 
as such he should have known what was best for his firm in connection with the 
purchase, and when he failed to make his intention clear and definite, he alone 
should be blamed for the consequences. The vendor cannot be expected to presume 
the particular commodity a customer desires to buy when he goes to his store and 
make his own choice and pays for it. After the vendor has done his part of 
delivering the merchandise the purchaser has chosen, it would be unfair to 
rescind the contract if it turns out not suitable to the purpose the latter has 
intended. This is the situation herein obtained.</p>
<p>Moreover, the hemp press installed was strictly in accordance with the 
description in the contract. There is no claim to the contrary. Such being the 
case, the fact that respondent could not use it to suit its own private and 
specific purpose cannot render the contract rescindable. The vendor has done his 
part and it is but fair that the vendee should do his. The contract in such a 
case is valid and binding and not rescindable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a careful examination of the record, we have not the. least doubt that 
the plaintiff delivered the machine as described in the sales contract, and <i>the 
fact that the defendant could not use it satisfactorily in the three cold stores 
divisions cannot be attributed to plaintiff's fault; as far as we can see, the 
machine was strictly in accordance with the written contract between the parties,</i> 
and the defendant can hardly honestly say that there was any deception by the 
plaintiff. (See article 327, Code of Commerce; Palanca vs. Fred Wilson &amp; 
Co., 37 Phil., 506)." (Pacific Commercial Company vs. Ermita Market &amp; Cold 
Stores, Inc., 56 Phil., 617, 620-621; Italics supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed. The complaint is 
dismissed, with costs against respondent.</p>
<p><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p><p align="center"><i><br></i></p>
<p><b>LABRADOR</b>, J., </p>
<p>The facts found by the Court of Appeals, which cannot be modified by Us, are 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is to be also noted in this connection that J. Deane Conrad who carried 
out the transaction with Co Cho Chit, is not a mechanic while the vendor is the 
head, if not the owner, of Grace Park Engineering; that Hanson, Orth &amp; 
Stevenson, Inc., for which the hemp press was bought, needed this machine in the 
operation of its business of exporting hemp from the country; that with the 
exception of a very small percentage, almost all of the hemp produced in the 
Philippines is for exportation; that since its installation the hemp press in 
question has not been able to bale hemp of regulation size for exportation; and 
that because of this failure or defect plaintiff has never accepted said hemp 
press. Such being the case, and even if the terms of the contract do not 
specifically or expressly bind defendant to make the installation of the hemp 
press but only to furnish the service of competent mechanics to supervise the 
installation thereof, yet this hemp press had to be installed under the 
supervision of the personnel of the defendant and had 'to give (after 
installation) satisfactory service under reasonable use of same, for a period of 
six months, excepting breakage of any part thereof due to careless handling by 
plaintiff's operators'; and such service could not be 'satisfactory' if the hemp 
press could not be used, after its installation, in accordance with appellee's 
business of exportation of hemp. In the case at bar, the failure in carrying out 
the installation in question may not be a basis for rescission of the contract 
Exhibit A, but even so, there still would be ground for the resolution thereof 
if one of the parties thereto fails to fulfill his part of the 
contract."</p></blockquote>The above facts fully justify the conclusion and 
judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals. I, therefore, believe that said 
judgment should be affirmed.
