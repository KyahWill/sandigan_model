				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition  for certiorari against an  order of  the Court of Industrial Relations  entered in  Case  No.  458—V  (1),  dated  July  12, 1956, requiring  petitioner herein H.  E. Heacock Co. to pay  bonuses to all its employees who have not received  the same for the years  1950,  1951 and 1952, equivalent to three  months salary.   This order was issued after trial of a motion filed in the said  court which, for  convenience and  exactness,  is  herein below reproduced: <br><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote> "MOTION <br></blockquote></div><blockquote>"Comes now the petitioner,  by the undersigned attorney, and to this Honorable Court, respectfully  states: <br> <br>"That on April 17,  1948, the respondent granted a bonus equivalent to one month's salary to all of its employees because of the profits that it had realized  for the year 1947 ; <br><br>"That on the occasion of the distribution of the said bonus, the respondent  told its employees that said bonus will be paid yearly if the company is making profits; <br> <br>"That for the years 1950, 1951  and  1962, the company  made plenty of profits, but  instead of  paying  the bonus  to all of  its employees as it had promised, the respondent paid the same only to the high salaried officials  of the  company, thereby discriminating against its  low  salaried employees; <br> <br>"That up to now, the respondent had not paid  the bonus to the latter. <br> <br>WHEREFORE,  it is  respectfully prayed of this  Honorable Court that the respondent be ordered to pay the bonus  to all of its employees who have not  yet received the same  corresponding to one month's salary  for the year 1950, another one month's salary for the year 1951  and an  additional one month's salary  for tho year 1952. <br> <br> "Manila,  May 9, 1953. </blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="33%"> <br></td><td width="34%"> <br></td><td width="33%">(Sgd.)EULOGIO R.

Mesa Blvd., Manila </td></tr></tbody></table><br>The events  leading  to the presentation of  the above motion may  be briefly stated  as follows: On  June 26, 1950, the  National Labor Union, respondent in this action for certiorari, filed  a petition in  Case No. 4S8—V  of the Court of  Industrial Relations,  entitled  "National  Labor Union <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  H.  E. Heacock Co."; alleging, that in the year 1948,  the  respondent  had  granted  bonuses  to  its employees because of profits realized in the  year 1947 and that on the occasion of the distribution of the said bonuses the respondent  then promised its employees the payment of said  bonuses yearly if the company made profits; that the company realized profits in 1948, but had not paid  the  promised  bonuses;  that contrary to their bargaining agreement  of April, 1949,  the company refused to submit  their dispute about bonus  to the labor-management committee, that in May,  1950, the same demand for submission of  the dispute to the  same committee was made but again  it  was refused,  so  the employees of the petitioner declared strike; that the Department of Labor intervened in the dispute and upon its failure to settle the same,  the  matter was  submitted for  arbitration to the Court  of  Industrial Relations in June, 1950.   After the hearing on this petition, the Court of Industrial Relations rendered a decision ordering respondent  therein  to  pay bonuses equivalent to one month salary for the years 1948 and 1949.  Decision in this case was rendered on April 3, 1951, and it was  taken by certiorari to us and we  decided it on July 31, 1954. <br><br>After the motion in the case at bar was  presented (May 9, 1953)  and while the  original case involving  bonuses for the years  1948 and 1949 were pending decision, Congress passed  the Industrial  Peace  Act,  but it was not approved till June  17, 1953. <br><br>The main issue presented to us in the petition  for certiorari is, whether  the Court of Industrial Relations has jurisdiction over  the motion  above quoted.  It is claimed by the petitioner  herein  that the motion covers causes of action, distinct and separate  from those  covered  by the original action, Case No. 458  (V), in the  Court of Industrial Relations.   This objection  was presented before the lower  court, but the same was overruled by  it  on the authority  of the  decisions rendered by us in San Miguel Brewery, Inc.  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Court of Industrial Relations,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>G. R. No. L-4634, prom. April 28,  1952,  and  Manila  Trading  &amp; Supply Company  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Philippine Labor Union,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup>40 Off. Gaz., 149.   The  first case cited, however, is not  applicable to the case now before us, because  it involves  a previous order of the court suspending the dismissal, suspension, and  transfer  of  employees during the pendency  of the principal case, which was violated by the  company.  Neither is  the  second  case  applicable because the order enforced by subsequent motion  was one  directing the  reinstatement of an employee, which reinstatement was ordered by  the Supreme  Court and because the reinstatement was  the main  issue involved  in  the main case. <br><br>From its very context it  is  evident that the motion which the court below considers merely as a continuation of the previous case is not actually a continuation thereof, because what is sought in the motion is the payment of the  bonuses for the years 1950, 1951  and 1952, whereas the  subject matter of  the previous action was bonuses for the  years  1948 and 1949 only.  It is true that the right which is the basis of the payment of bonuses demanded in the motion  now in question is the same as that which gives rise to the bonuses granted  for the years 1947 and 1948.   But the right to recover said bonuses for the years 1950, 1951 and 1952  depended in part upon whether  or not  the company realized profits during those years  (not upon whether  or  not profits were made  in the years 1947 and  1948).  The right  to  enforce the  claims arose only upon the actual  making  of the  profits  by the petitioner during the years 1950, 1951 and 1952.  The  record discloses that  the  petitioner  and  the  respondent do not agree as to the amount of profits made  during the  different years in question,  so  issues of fact existed upon which trial was necessary. <br><br>It can also be seen  that there  is  no allegation in the motion  that a  labor  dispute causing or  likely to cause a  strike, or a possibility thereof is imminent or expected from the violation  or  failure of the petitioner to  comply with its promise.  The respondent, therefore, only seeks in the motion to assert money claims, based on an alleged promise made previously.  This may have occasioned a labor dispute and a previous  strike;  but nowhere  does  it now appear that it has again produced a labor dispute, causing or likely to cause a strike  or lockout.  Under the circumstances,  therefore, the motion  does  not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.   The law  on  the point is clear that the  dispute must give  rise to or probably cause  a strike or  lockout, in order that the  Court  of Industrial Relations  may  have jurisdiction to try  the claims, thus: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 4.—The Court shall take cognizance for purposes of prevention, arbitration, decision,  and  settlement, of any industrial (or agricultural)  dispute causing  or likely to cause a strike or lockout, arising from  differences as regards wages, shares or compensation, dismissals,  lay-offs, or suspensions of employees or laborers,  (tenants or farm-laborers), hours of labor, or conditions of tenancy or employment, between employers and employees or laborers  (and between landlords and tenants or  farmlaborers), provided that the number of  employees, laborers  (or tenants or farm  laborers) involved exceeds thirty, and such industrial (or agricultural) dispute is submitted to the Court by  the Secretary of Labor, or by any or both of the parties to the controversy. * * *."  (Com. Act  No. 103).</blockquote>The certiorari is  hereby granted, the  order  subject of the  petition is hereby  reversed  and the motion dismissed, with costs against the respondent  National Labor Union.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C,  J.,  Bengzon,  Reyes,   A.,  Bautista  Angelo, Concepcion,  Reyes,  J.
