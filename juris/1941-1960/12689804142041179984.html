				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a.petition for&nbsp; review of a decision&nbsp; of the Court of Industrial Relations holding that the collective bargaining&nbsp; and closed shop agreement entered into&nbsp; between the Bacolod-Murcia Milling&nbsp; Co., Inc. and the Allied Workers Association of the Philippines is null and void and finding the former guilty of unfair labor practice as a result&nbsp; of which&nbsp; it was ordered to desist from&nbsp; such practice&nbsp; and to reinstate all the&nbsp; laborers and employees&nbsp; it dismissed from the service with back pay from the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of their discharge to the&nbsp; time of their reinstatement.<p>In the month&nbsp; of July&nbsp; or&nbsp; August, 1953, a good number of laborers&nbsp; of the Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc., hereinafter referred to as Company for&nbsp; short, most of them affiliated with the Allied Workers Association of the Philippines,&nbsp; hereinafter referred to as Allied Workers Association&nbsp; (AWA), organized the National Employees-Workers Security Union (NEWSUN), which was registered in the Department of Labor on January 123, 1954.&nbsp; On December 24,1953, the president of the NEWSUN, one Humberto M. Tutaan, sent a letter to the management of the Company containing&nbsp; several labor demands.&nbsp; The Company, through its manager, on January 7, 1954, acknowledged said letter stating in substance that the Company is not opposed to the formation or&nbsp; organization of any labor union as in fact it&nbsp; has already&nbsp; recognized the Allied Workers Association with which it has concluded a collective bargaining and closed shop agreement, for which reason it has to decline the., demands contained in the letter. In said&nbsp; agreement, it was covenanted that during the life of the agreement, no member of the labor union shall join another labor organization and any member who violates this condition, or ceases to be a member thereof, shall be dropped from the&nbsp; service by the employer.</p><p>On February 5,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the Allied Workers Association addressed a letter to the employer stating&nbsp; that some of its members had been&nbsp; expelled&nbsp; from the association and requesting that they be dropped from the service in line with the closed shop&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp; Finding no other alternative,&nbsp; the management dropped&nbsp; these members&nbsp; from the service&nbsp; after giving them a notice to that effect and paying&nbsp; them a salary equivalent to one month.&nbsp; As a result, these&nbsp; members&nbsp; filed charges&nbsp; of unfair labor practice against the employer which initiated these proceedings before the Court of Industrial Relations.</p><p>The questions to be determined are:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Is the closed shop&nbsp; agreement entered into between the Company and the Allied Workers Association null and&nbsp; void?&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Can the Company be&nbsp; held guilty of&nbsp; unfair labor practice for having&nbsp; dismissed from the service&nbsp; the complaining members in&nbsp; line with said closed shop agreement?</p><p>It appears that&nbsp; the Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co.,&nbsp; Inc. is a corporation operating a sugar central at Bacolod City, Occidental Negros.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has many laborers and employees. Right&nbsp; from the start these&nbsp; laborers organized a labor union known as Allied Wokers Association&nbsp; of the Philippines which&nbsp; since 1947&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into a collective bargaining and closed shop agreement with said Company. Said agreement has been renewed from time&nbsp; to time, that is, in 1949, 1950 and 1953.&nbsp; During the milling season of 1953-1954, there were a total of 1,198 laborers and employees in that Company, both permanent and temporary, and about 736 thereof were members of said&nbsp; union, which shows that at least 2/3 of the total number&nbsp; of employees and laborers were affiliated with said union&nbsp; and as such it has&nbsp; the requisite number to conclude a collective bargaining contract under the law [section 12,&nbsp; subsection (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>), Republic Act&nbsp; 875].&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; it appears that it was only as late as July or August, 1953, that another union was formed, under the leadership&nbsp; of Humberto M. Tiitaan, most 6f whom were members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Allied Workers Association, which union&nbsp; was registered in the Department of Labor only on January 23,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; The new collective bargaining agreement was signed on December 19, 1953.</p><p>Considering this&nbsp; factual background, can&nbsp; we say that the Court of Industrial Relations was correct&nbsp; in holding that this&nbsp; agreement is illegal because, in its opinion,&nbsp; it violates section&nbsp; 12, subsection (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; of Republic Act 875, which permits&nbsp; an employer to petition the court for an election "if there has&nbsp; been no certification&nbsp; election held during the twelve months prior to the date of the request of the employees, and if the employer has reasonable doubt as to the bargaining representative of the employees in the appropriate unit,"&nbsp; Let us analyze the provisions of the law concerning the conclusion of collective bargaining agreements.</p><p>There are four&nbsp; different ways under which a collective bargaining&nbsp; agreement may be&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; between the employer and his employees.&nbsp; These are the ones specified in subdivisions (<em>a</em>),&nbsp; (<em>b</em>),&nbsp; (<em>c</em>)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (<em>d</em>) of section&nbsp; 12&nbsp; of Republic Act 875 which,&nbsp; for purposes of reference,&nbsp; we quote:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"(<em>a</em>) The labor organization&nbsp; designated or selected for the purpose of&nbsp; collective bargaining'by the majority of the employees in an&nbsp; appropriate collective bargaining unit shall be&nbsp; the&nbsp; exclusive representative of all the employees&nbsp; in&nbsp; such&nbsp; unit for the purpose of collective bargaining iii respect to rates of&nbsp; pay, wages, hours of employment, or other&nbsp; conditions of employment: Provided,&nbsp; That any individual employee or group of&nbsp; employees, shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; the right at any time to present grievances to their employer.&nbsp; </p><p>"(<em>b</em>) Whenever a&nbsp; question arises&nbsp; concerning&nbsp; the&nbsp; representation of employees, the Court may investigate such controversy and certify to the parties in writing the name of the&nbsp; labor organization that has been designated or selected for the appropriate bargaining unit.&nbsp; In any such&nbsp; investigation,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; shall&nbsp; provide for a speedy and&nbsp; appropriate hearing upon&nbsp; due&nbsp; notice&nbsp; and&nbsp; if there is&nbsp; any reasonable doubt as to whom&nbsp; the employees have choosen as their representative for purposes of collective bargaining, the Court shall order a secret&nbsp; ballot election to be conducted by the Department of Labor, to ascertain who is the freely chosen representative of the employees, under such rules&nbsp; and regulations as the Court may prescribe, at which balloting representatives of&nbsp; the contending parties shall&nbsp; have the&nbsp; right to attend as inspectors.&nbsp; Such a balloting shall be known as a 'certification election' and the Court shall not order certifications in the same&nbsp; unit&nbsp; more often than once in twelve months.&nbsp; The organization&nbsp; receiving the majority of Votes cast.in such&nbsp; election shall be&nbsp; certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of such employees.&nbsp; </p><p>"(<em>c</em>) In an instance where a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; filed by at least&nbsp; ten per cent of the employees in the appropriate unit requesting&nbsp; an election,&nbsp; it shall be mandatory&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; to&nbsp; order an&nbsp; election for the purpose of&nbsp; determining the representative of the employees for the appropriate bargaining unit.</p><p>" (<em>d</em>) When&nbsp; requested&nbsp; to bargain&nbsp; collectively, an&nbsp; employer may petition the Court for an election if there has been no certification election&nbsp; held during the&nbsp; twelve months prior to the date of the requests of the employees,&nbsp; and if the employer&nbsp; has reasonable doubt as to the bargaining representative of the employees in&nbsp; the appropriate unit."</p></blockquote><p>Note&nbsp; that&nbsp; under the "first method, a majority of the employees may&nbsp; designate the labor organization it may choose to act as its representative for the purpose of collective bargaining, which it can do without court intervention, and the organization so designated may immediately conclude a collective bargaining&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; with its employer,&nbsp;&nbsp; [subsection&nbsp; (<em>a</em>)].&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; second method, on&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; requires judicial investigation&nbsp; to&nbsp; determine which labor organization has.been designated as the representative of the employees whenever a&nbsp; question&nbsp; arises concerning such representation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if the court should find&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; doubt as&nbsp; to whom the employees have chosen&nbsp; after such investigation, it shall order a certification election [subsection (<em>b</em>)].&nbsp; The third method authorizes at least 10 per cent of the employees in the appropriate unit to request an election,&nbsp; which shall be mandatory&nbsp; on the court whenever a petition is filed requesting such election to determine the representation of the employees [subsection&nbsp;&nbsp; (<em>c</em>)].&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fourth method is&nbsp; the one which permits&nbsp; an employer to petition the court for an election if there has been no certification election held during the twelve months prior to the date of the request of the employees,&nbsp; and if the employer has reasonable doubt&nbsp; as&nbsp; to the bargaining representative of the employees in the appropriate unit [subsection&nbsp; (<em>d</em>)].</p><p>In the case at bar, the method pursued "by the Bacolod-Murcia&nbsp; Milling Co., Inc. and&nbsp; its employees is that provided for in subsection (<em>a</em>).&nbsp; This they did when in 1947 they entered into a collective bargaining and closed shop agreement, which was renewed in 1949,&nbsp; 1950 and 1953.&nbsp; And this was made possible because of the organization of the Allied Workers Association.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; this was the only&nbsp; labor union then organized among said employees, for the other union was validly organized only on January 23, 1954, when it&nbsp; was registered&nbsp; in the Department of Labor, there was therefore no reason for the application of the other three&nbsp; methods of collective bargaining,&nbsp; and so it was a mistake to hold that the agreement&nbsp; concluded between them on December 19, 1953 has not been.entered into in accordance with law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor can it be said that the fourth method prescribed&nbsp; in subsection (<em>d</em>) is applicable, as found by the court,&nbsp; for neither the employer&nbsp; has asked for&nbsp; any certification&nbsp; election, nor&nbsp; has it any&nbsp; doubt as to the bargaining representative of the employees.</p><blockquote><p>"* *&nbsp; * labor organization la not considered legitimate in contemplation of law unless&nbsp; that requirement has been complied with. Thus, the law postulates&nbsp; that 'a&nbsp; legitimate labor&nbsp; organization is an&nbsp; organization, association or union, of&nbsp; laborers <em>duly registered and permitted to operate</em> by the Department of Labor', and that 'the registration of, and the issuance of a permit to, any legitimate labor organization shall entitle it&nbsp; to&nbsp; all the rights and privileges granted by law/ (Sections 1&nbsp; and&nbsp; 2, Commonwealth Act No. 213.) To be&nbsp; considered a legitimate labor organization with the&nbsp; right to enjoy all the rights and&nbsp; privileges recognized by law,&nbsp; it is therefore necessary that it be registered and&nbsp; permitted to&nbsp; operate&nbsp; as required by law."&nbsp; (Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union (PLASLU), Inc. <em>vs.</em> Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations, 93 Phil., 747; 49 Off. Gaz.f [9] 3859.)</p></blockquote><p>Another ground&nbsp; on&nbsp; which the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations predicates the invalidity&nbsp; of the agreement in question is that some of its stipulations contravene the&nbsp; provisions of the law which&nbsp; prohibits unfair labor practices.&nbsp; The court&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; that said&nbsp; stipulations tend to impair the right of the employees to self-organization for they have the&nbsp; effect of forcing the employees&nbsp; to become or remain a member of a labor organization on pain of losing&nbsp; their employment if they join any other&nbsp; labor union.&nbsp; And&nbsp; this,&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; contains,&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; labor practice.</p><p>With the finding we disagree, for it ignores the&nbsp; specific provision of our&nbsp; law which precisely recognizes the conclusion of&nbsp; a&nbsp; closed shop agreement&nbsp; Thus, in section 4, subsection&nbsp; (a), paragraph 4, of Republic Act No. 875, it is expressly provided "That nothing in this Act or in any other Act or statute of the Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines shall preclude an&nbsp; employer from making an agreement with a labor organization to require&nbsp; as a&nbsp; condition of employement membership therein, if such labor organization is the representative of the&nbsp; employees * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; And in a similar case where the dismissed employees raised the validity of ah agreement of this&nbsp; nature, this Court made the following comment: '"The&nbsp; closed-up contract.&nbsp; it&nbsp; is said 'is the most prized achievement&nbsp; of unionism. It adds membership and compulsory dues.&nbsp; By holding put to loyal members a&nbsp; promise of employment&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; closed-shop,&nbsp; it welds&nbsp; group solidarity.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (Handler,&nbsp; Notes, 48 Yale Law Journal&nbsp; 1053, 1059;&nbsp; Francisco,&nbsp; Labor&nbsp; Laws&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 186.)" Then, after stating the arguments pro and&nbsp; con, the Court concluded:</p><blockquote><p>"'Closed-shop&nbsp; agreement is&nbsp; an agreement whereby an employer binds himself to hire only members of the contracting&nbsp; union who must continue to remain, members in&nbsp; good standing to keep their jobs. While&nbsp; there are arguments in favor of,&nbsp; and&nbsp; against&nbsp; the closed-shop agreement, Congress, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; exercise of&nbsp; its&nbsp; policy-making power,&nbsp; has&nbsp; approved the closed shop,&nbsp; in section 4, subsection (<em>a</em>) paragraph 4 of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 875."&nbsp; (National Labor Union, <em>vs</em>. Aguinaldo's Echague, Inc., Off. Gaz., No. 6, p. 2899.)</p></blockquote><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
