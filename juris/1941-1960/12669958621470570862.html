				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On May 25, 1935, more than 720 tenants filed an action (civil 
case No. 6663) in the Court of First Instance of Laguna against Colegio de San 
Jose, praying that defendant be compelled to respect its contracts of lease with 
plaintiffs on some parcels of lands located in San pedro Tunasan, Laguna. After 
trial, judgment was rendered declaring that plaintiffs and their privies or 
agents had no longer any right to contiune occupying the property in litigation 
and they were ordered to vacate and deliver the same to the defendant. On 
appeal, the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in a decision 
promulgated on July 31, 1940.
<p align="justify">The property was later purchased by the Commonwealth of the 
Philippines and came under the direct and exclusive management of the respondent 
Rural Progress Administration. On October 9, 1946, an action was filed in the 
Court of First Instance of the same province against the Rural Progress 
Administration and others by numerous plaintiffs allegedly the same plaintiffs 
in the former civil case No. 6663, or their agents or successors in interest. In 
this new complaint, registered as civil case No. 8039, it is prayed that the 
title of Colegio de San Jose on the property in litigation and the sale in favor 
of the Commonwealth of the Philippines be declared null and void. Apparently, 
this second complaint was dismissed on motion of the Rural Progress 
Administration on the ground of <i>res adjudicata</i> and lack of cause of 
action, and from the order of dismissal an appeal was taken to this Court.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the other hand, the Rural Progress Administration filed 
several complaints for forcible entry and detainer on teh same property and 
againtst the same plaintiffs, their agents or successors in interest in the 
justice of the peace court of San Pedro Tunasan, Laguna. To these complaints, 
the defendants filed motions for dismissal alleging that the justice of the 
peace court had no jurisdiction because there was already an action for title 
pending then in the Court of First Instance, which was civil case No. 8039 above 
mentioned. The justice of the peace denied the motion for dismissal on the 
ground that the facts alleged in the complaints constitute forcible entry and 
detainer falling within his jurisdiction. Wherefore, the defendants filed their 
action for certiorari in the Court of First Instance, which was dismissed after 
trial upon the ground that the proer remedy was appeal, and that, furthermore, 
the respondent justice of the peace had jurisdiction over the subject matter and 
over the persons of the parties. The order of dismissal was appealed to this 
Court.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, the cases for forcible entry and detainer were 
tried by the justice of the peace court and judgments were rendered therein 
against the defendants which have become final and executory, some of them 
having been already executed and the others about to be executed. The defendants 
asked for suspension of execution, but because said petition was denied they 
filed the present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no doubt that the justice of the peace court of San 
Pedro Tunasan, laguna, had jurisdiction over all the cases for forcible entyr 
and detainer filed with it by the Rural Progress Administration. The pendency of 
an action for title filed by the defendants against the plaintiffs in the Court 
of First Instance is no good ground for impugning the jurisdiction of the 
justice of the peace court. Furthermore, well known is the rule that an action 
for ownership is not a bar to an action for forcible entry and detainer. Whether 
title is necessarily involved in an action for forcible entry and detainer is a 
question of fact to be determined from the evidence presented by both parties at 
the trial, and that question can be reviewed only on appeal and not by 
certiorari proceedings in the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p align="justify">If the justice of the peace court had jurisdiction over the 
forcible entry and detainer cases, then it had also jurisdiction to try and 
render judgments therein and order the execution of said judgments. True that an 
action for certiorari had been filed in the Court of First Instance to set aside 
the order of the justice of the peace court by which it assumed such 
jurisdiction; but if no writ of preliminary injunction was issued therein by the 
Court of First Instance against the justice of the peace court, the latter could 
continue trying and deciding the said cases and order the execution of the 
judgments rendered therein.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition is dismissed with costs against petitioners.</p>

<p align="justify">Justice Pablo voted for dismissal.</p></div>
