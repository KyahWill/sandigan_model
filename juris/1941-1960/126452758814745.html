				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF  THE  PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLEE, VS. ANACLETO UY ALMEDA BT AL., DEFENDANTS. ANACLETO UY ALMEDA, APPELLANT. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, convicting the  appellant, Anacleto Uy Almeda, of the offense of qualified trespass to dwelling and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for the indeterminate period of from four months  and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em> to two years, four months and one day of <em>prision correctional</em>, with the accessories of the law and one-third of the costs.</p>
<p>The facts established during the trial are substantially as follows:  On the morning of November  13,  1940,  the appellant, in company with other persons, arrived  at the house of  Honorata Limpo in the  municipality of  Bifian, Province of Laguna.  The latter was thereupon informed by  appellant's companion, Potenciano Villano, that  they were going to demolish and repair her house, to which HoHorata Limpo objected, specially  in view of the absence of her husband  at the time.  Unheeding this opposition, and  upon express orders of the appellant, his companions Potenciano Villano and Antonio Dysionglo  proceeded  to gain entry into the house by means of two  ladders which they placed against the front wall and to  remove some boards and iron sheets that served to cover the front side. Appellant's designs were  put to a  stop, however, only by the arrival of Honorata's son named Francisco, who called a policeman to the scene.</p>
<p>It appears that the house in question was built on a lot  inclosed by a  stone fence having an iron grill gate. On the same  lot the  appellant had a warehouse; and  as he had  freely used said gate in going to his property, it is now contended that his entry into the yard of Honorata Limpo, which was a part of her &quot;dwelling,&quot; could not have been unauthorized  or against her will, so as to warrant his conviction under article 280 of the Revised Penal Code. Appellant's argument would require some  inquiry if the lot on which Honorata's house was erected were exclusively hers  and the  appellant had  not  admittedly used  Its gate in common with Honorata,  and  if  said argument would not further lead to a plainly unacceptable, nay undesirable, result that simply because  he had  free entry into and passage on the common lot, he could have the same right as regards  Honorata's house.</p>
<p>Another  defense  pressed  in  this appeal  is that  the opposition registered  by Honorata  Limpo was  directed against the demolition or repair of her  house and  not against the original entry of the appellant and his companions into the yard or premises of her dwelling, and that although the removal of some boards and iron sheets, done by the appellant through his companions after their lawful entry, may constitute an independent offense, the said subsequent act cannot be the trespass  denned and penalized by article 280  of the Revised  Penal Code.  This contention is of course partly disposed of in the preceding paragraph. It is  only necessary to add that Honorata could not have consented to appellant's  intrusion into the house, which made him  a  trespasser,  for the  very  purpose  already objected  to by her.   Moreover, the method employed by appellant's men in  effecting  entry suggests prior refusal on the part of Honorata to admit them through its stairs. Neither is there any point in  appellant's pretense that, one week before  the occasion in question,  he had  notified Honorata about the intended repairs, because said notice did and could not mean  her  subsequent conformity.</p>
<p>The appellant next tries to exculpate himself by maintaining that there is absolutely no proof as to his criminal intent in entering the yard or even the house of Honorata. Indeed, it is insisted that he merely wanted to repair said house over which he  was claiming ownership.  Appellant thus pretended to have bought the house for P70 from the estranged wife of Honorata's son against whose father he subsequently  filed a  suit  to recover the  premises.  This case was however, decided  against him.   We are of the opinion that the alleged ownership is immaterial, for even supposing that the house belonged to  the appellant,  that fact alone did not authorize him to do anything with or enter the house  against the will  of its  actual occupant. He could have invoked the aid of the court for the exercise or protection of  his  alleged  proprietary rights.  What  is intended  to be protected and preserved by the law is the privacy  of  one's dwelling,  and,  except in  those  cases enumerated' in the third paragraph of  article 280 of the Revised  Penal  Code, criminal  intent inheres  in the unwelcome visit of  a trespasser.</p>
<p>The judgment  appealed from is affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.  J., Jaranilla, Feria, Pablo</em>, and <em>Briones, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
