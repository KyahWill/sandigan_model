				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J. B. L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Elias Oyco was charged before the Court of First Instance of  Negros Occidental with the  crime  of  murder, in  an information worded as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That about 7:00 o'clock in  the morning of  April 6, 1957, at sitio Binitinan, municipality of Murcia,  province of Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction  of this  Honorable Court, the herein accused, armed with a bolo which he was then provided, with intent to kill  and with  evident premeditation and treachery did,  then and there,  willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, attack, assault and wound Esmundo Macabibi, a  blind man,  inflicting upon the  latter wounds and injuries which produced  his instantaneous death."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After trial, the court  rendered  judgment finding the accused  guilty of  murder, qualified by  premeditation and aggravated by treachery:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"POR TANTO, el Juzgado declara el  acusado Elias  Oyco, culpable fuera de  toda duda racional del delito de asesinato alegado en la querella, y habiendo concurrido la circunstancia modificativa de alevosia, le  condena a sufrir la pena de reclusidn  perpetua, con  las accessorias  de la ley, y  a indemnizar a los  herederos  del occiso Esmundo Macabibi  en la  siuna de P6,000.00. El acusado pagara las  costas del juicio."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not agreeable to the sentence imposed upon  him, Oyco appealed, urging  that  the  lower  court erred in  not appreciating in his  favor the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and in  taking into account the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation.</p>
<p>The evidence on  record  is conclusive that at about  8:00 o'clock in the morning of April  6,  1957, in the house of Cesar Bacaro in  sitio Binitinan, municipality of  Murcia, Negros Occidental, while Carmelita Bacaro, Florenia Abenido  and  Esmundo Macabibi,  a totally blind man,  were preparing to go  to town, accused  Elias  Oycox arrived, carrying a sheathed bolo  around  his  waist.  Oyco then confronted Esmundo, who  was sitting on the second step of the three-step staircase of the house, and bluntly told him, "Esmundo it is good you are here.   It is your hour," Esmundo was then heard  to have counseled,  "Eling,  let us arrange the matter amicably because this is a small matter."   Accused evidently did not heed Esmundo's plea for he countered,  "You (referring  to  Esmundo)  are a fool and a blind man", and  immediately struck  Esmundo on the forehead with his bolo.   Esmundo fell, and  Carmelita Bacaro, the victim's  half-sister, rushed to help him, but she retreated when defendant threatened to attack her also.   The assailant fled  and surrendered himself and the fatal weapon  to Restituto Bibaoco, the barrio vice-lieutenant, who, in turn, delivered him to the proper authorities.</p>
<p>Esmundo Macabibi was brought to the Negros Occidental</p>
<p>Provincial Hospital where he died.  The medical certificate issued by Dr. Rodolfo  Escalona shows that the  cause of death was due to a-</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"wound, incised, 6 inches  long, between  11  and  2  inches deep, transverse, forehead, fracturing skull  (frantal region)  with brain tissues coming out thru the fracture area"  (Exhibit "A"),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sustained by the deceased.</p>
<p>Motive for  the killing was attributed to a misunderstanding between the accused and the deceased regarding their business which occurred on April 4, 1957.</p>
<p>With the foregoing facts attested to by the eye-witnesses to the  actual slaying,  Carmelita  Bacaro  and  Florenia Abenido, and  by the testimony of Restituto Bibaoco,  the barrio vice-lieutenant to whom the culprit later surrendered after  the  boloing  incident,  and that of the physician, Dr. Rodolfo Escalona, who  certified to the cause  of death, the lower court,  in  our opinion,  correctly discredited  the incredible theory of the  defense1 that the fatal bolo blow was delivered by the victim's half-brother, Cesar Bacaro (who was not even at the scene of the incident according to the prosecution's evidence), when the deceased,<em> a blind man,</em> in an effort to stop the appellant, unfortunately placed himself between  the  accused  and  Cesar  at the precise time when the latter was about to strike appellant;  and that,  as he (accused) successfully side-stepped the blow, Cesar  instead hit his blind half-brother. Since the victim was unarmed and totally blind in  both eyes, the killing was qualified by treachery; the appellant caused the death without risk to himself arising from the defense that the offended party might make.  Upon the other hand, It is_ not clearly  shown that the accused clung to the idea of killing Macabibi  for  a period long enough  to allow  him to  reflect on the consequences of his intended  act, as is required in order that evident premeditation can be held to  exist.</p>
<p>The penalty prescribed  for murder is, under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its maximum period to death.  Taking into account the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender (Art. 13, No. 7, R. P. C), which the lower  court failed to consider, and there being no  aggravating circumstance to  offset it  (since evident premeditation was not proved), the penalty  should be imposed in its minimum period  (Art. 64, No. 2, R. P. C.) or <em>reclusion  temporal</em> in its  maximum period.</p>
<p>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, this Court modifies the judgment appealed from and hereby sentences appellant Elias Oyco to undergo imprisonment for a period ranging from twelve  (12) years  of <em>prision mayor,</em> as minimum, to eighteen (18) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal,</em> as maximum, with all the accessory penalties prescribed by law.   The indemnity adjudged by the lower court is correct and is, therefore, affirmed.   No costs in this instance.</p>
