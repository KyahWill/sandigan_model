				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J. B. L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petition to review on certiorari the decision of May 29, 1958 of the Court of Industrial Relations and its resolution <em>en banc,</em> dated  July  31, 1958, rendered in Case No.  1021-ULP.</p>
<p>On September  10, 1956, respondent Juan Frivaldo filed with the Court of  Industrial Relations an unfair labor practice  (ULP)  case  against the petitioners Permanent Concrete Products, Inc., and  its personnel manager, Enrico M.  Santiago.   The case was tried before the Honorable Judge  Juan L.  Lanting  (now an associate Justice of the Court of Appeals).  On May 14,  1957,  after the parties had  presented their  evidence, both oral and documentary, the case was submitted for  decision.  While the case was pending resolution, it  is averred that Judge Lanting was "commissioned  by the  Philippine Government to assist the government of the  South American  Republics to  codify Labor  Laws", so that on June 14, 1957, he departed for his mission abroad.   On his return to  the Philippines in the latter part  of December  of the same year, however, he underwent medical  treatment, for which  reason he was continually absent from his <em>sala</em>.</p>
<p>On May  29, 1958 or after  the lapse of one (1) year and fifteen (15)  days from the submission of the case for decision, the court <em>a quo</em> rendered its decision from which this  petition was taken.  The dispositive  portion thereof reads  as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,  this Court finds the respondents guilty of  unfair  labor practice  for having discriminated  against Juan Frivaldo in the exercise of his trade union rights  and  for having  discharged  him for union activities.</p>
  <p>Respondents' contention that this Court has no jurisdiction over the  case is untenable because the law applicable is Republic Act 875, and not Commonwealth Act  103, as amended.</p>
  <p>Respondents  are  hereby  ordered  (1) to cease and  desist  from interfering:  with the right  of  their employees to affiliate with or join a union of their own choosing, (2) to reinstate Juan Frivaldo to the position he was  occupying  at the time  of  his  discharge, and (3) to indemnify  him  in  amount equivalent to the  aggregate of the wages he failed to  receive  for the period beginning  from July 7,  1956 t6 the date  of his actual reinstatement."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners  filed their motion for  reconsideration,  but the court,  sitting en banc, denied the  same in its resolution of  July 31, 1958.</p>
<p>In this instance, as well as in their motion for reconsideration filed in the court below,  petitioners  ask that  the judgment  of  May  29,  1958 be  declared null and  void because it was rendered beyond the thirty-day period from" the submission of the case for decision.  Their argument is based  upon  Section  5(d)  of Republic Act  No.  875, which provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(d) The court  shall decide  all incidental motions raised in any unfair labor practice cases  within fifteen  (15) days from submission of the "same.  <em>All  other matters relative  to  such disputes including the main case shall be decided within thirty days  after the  submission of  the  case.   This provision  shall  be  considered mandatory  in  character.</em> (Italics supplied)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are of the opinion that petitioners' laches in waiting for over one (1)  year for the decision  in question places them in estoppel to invoke the provisions  of  said section. It is apparent that petitioners took no steps to call attention to the  delay,  or to  ask that the case be  reassigned and decided earlier, nor did they attempt to take other remedial measures; on the other hand,  they were content to wait until  the  decision, unfavorable to their contentions,  was rendered by Judge  Lanting.  Petitioners in fact  gambled on  the  verdict of the lower court, with  the idea.that they could always attack it as void, on account  of  the delay, if contrary to their interests.   Such attitude on the part of litigants deserves no sympathy from  us,  and should be interpreted as  a waiver  of the benefits of  the statutory provision quoted, for lack of  substantial  prejudice.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Congressional Record (Philippine Senate, Third Session, Vol. II, No. 69, pp. 1266-1267)  shows that the mandatory character of the period fixed for rendering decisions in unfair  labor practice cases was intended  to expedite cases for the benefit of laborers, who (as explained by the author of the provision in question, Senator Lorenzo M. Ta√±ada) "cannot afford such a delay."   But the  Legislature  has not  provided  that  decisions  of the  Industrial Court  rendered after the lapse of  thirty  days would be null  and void;  and  this  omission was evidently dictated by the realization that such nullity  would  only defeat the very purpose of the  clause, as  the parties would be  ultimately driven to bring anew  the case to the courts, thus subjecting the laborers to greater delay and hardship.</p>
<p>As well observed in Bruegger  <em>vs</em>. Cartier (126  N.  W. 491) on a  practically identical question:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Section 7039, Rev.  Codes  1905, provides for  a  compulsory decision within 60  days  after  a  cause  is  submitted to the  Court, sickness  or unavoidable casualty excepted.  The plaintiff contends that, under the  facts  alleged in  the  complaint in this case, Hie Honorable John  F.  Cowan by holding the decision of the  former. action between these parties  for more than  five years lost jurisdiction  under said  section  7039,  and  that the  judgment  entered in said action is  void.  In this he is  in  error.  Said section does not make void a judgment rendered after the expiration of 60 days. Mcquillan <em>vs</em>. Dinahue, 49 Cal.  157; Edmonds <em>vs</em>. Riley, 15 S. B. 470,  90 N. W. 139; Demaris <em>vs</em>. Barker,  et al., 33 Wash.  200, 74 Pac 362.  In Demaris <em>vs</em>. Barker, supra, the court says, in speaking of a similar  statute: 'But certainly, it was never thought that the remedy was to be found in  holding that  the judgment afterwards rendered  is nugatory.  To give it this construction is to  prolong the very evil it was  sought to  avoid,   and  to  punish  the very persons whom it was  intended  should be its  beneficiaries.   If the judgment, when rendered, is  to be declared void, then the litigants, who have already been subjected to an unconstitutional delay, must again be subjected to the additional delays necessary to again bring the cause to the condition  it was before the  court  violated  its sworn  duty.  They  must  also pay the accruing costs  necessary for that purpose.  Were the delay something within  the  control of the litigant, were  it caused by his  own  dereliction, the conclusion contended  for  might  be tolerated.  But the  litigant cannot control the action of  the  court after  he has submitted  his cause for its  decision.  It may  be that  the plaintiff could  by writ  of mandamus have compelled  the judge to render his decision  at any time after the expiration of the  60 days provided in section 7039 had expired,  but the judgment is not void because of the failure of the judge to render his  decision within the time required by law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, the additional statement in the law that the 30-day provision "shall be  considered as  mandatory in character" was simply designed to provide the parties to the industrial dispute  with means to compel  prompt disposition of the case  by the  court  by writ  of mandamus,  administrative complaint or  similar recourse (cf. Bruegger <em>vs</em>.  Cartier, <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p>Our  views  on the  present  issue are  in  harmony with those  expressed  by us in  connection with provisions  of similar import in Section 177 of the Election  Code, requiring electoral contests to be decided  within six (6) months (in case of municipal offices)  and  one  (1) year  (in contests for provincial positions).  In Querubin <em>vs</em>. Court  of Appeals, 82 Phil., 229, this Court said  (cas. cit, pp. 229-230):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"To  dismiss ah  election contest  or the appeal  taken  therein because  the  respective courts, regardless of cause or reason, have failed to render final  decisions within  the time limits of said sections, is to defeat the administration of justice upon factors  beyond the control of the parties.  That would defeat the purposes of the due process of law and would make of  the administration of justice in election contests an aleatory  process  where  the litigants, irrespective of the merits  of their respective claims,  will be  gambling for a deadline.  The dismissal in such case will  constitute  a miscarriage  of  justice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners next question the failure of the lower court to set their motion for reconsideration for oral argument. Whether or not they are given this right is a matter within the sound discretion of the court; and we do not think that the denial in this case is an abuse thereof.   As we pointed out in Manansala <em>vs</em>. Heras, 103 Phil.,  575;  54 Off. Gaz.  (23) 6065, the movant is presumed to have set forth all the arguments in his written motion for reconsideration, thus obviating the necessity of further hearing the parties in oral  argument.</p>
<p>Lastly,  petitioners  assail  as  erroneous the lower  court's decision finding them guilty of unfair labor practice.  There is no merit in this  assertion.  The court's conclusion is substantiated by  the evidence  on record.  Juan Frivaldo, complainant therein, testified that previous to his dismissal, he was  warned by manager Santiago that unless he should desist from his  union activities, something would happen to him.  His testimony was corroborated in all essential parts by witnesses Lazaro San  Luis and  Teodoro Cavintoy. On the other hand, the court did not believe petitioners' assertion  that Frivaldo was discharged for cause,  having allegedly been caught sleeping while on duty  as a  watchman on the night of July 1, 1956.  It  appears  that on said night, complainant  Frivaldo  never missed  punching  the bundy clock every fifteen minutes during his tour of duty around the company's compound.  In giving more credence to herein respondent's attestations than to those  of  the petitioners,  it can not be said that the  court  a quo acted capriciously or with grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the instant petition is dismissed and  the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed.  Costs against the petitioners Permanent  Concrete  Products, Inc., and Enrico  M. Santiago.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, Gutierrez David,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
