				<H3>INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE DECEASED GAVINO REYES. MARIANO RODRIGUEZ, MARTA RODRIGUEZ AND CONCEPCION RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONERS AND APPELLEES, VS. ZOILO REYES, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It is of record that the spouses Gavino Villota y Reyes (<em>alias</em> 
Gavino Reyes) and Rosa Venal had acquired during their marriage certain 
properties among which were lots Nos. 5976, 43, 44, 45 and 46 and 200 of the 
Cadastral Survey of Sariaya, Quezon province. The husband Gavino Villota y Reyes 
having died intestate on April 20, 1935, without leaving issue, his widow Rosa 
Venal, without judicial settlement of her husband's estate, sold the aforesaid 
lots to the appellants Rodriguez sometime in the year 1939.
<p>On June 28, 1948, appellee Zoilo Reyes, allegedly a nephew of the late 
Gavino, instituted proceedings in Court for the settlement of the latter's 
estate, and was appointed Administrator (Special Proceedings No. 3029). In that 
capacity Zoilo filed an inventory of the estate of the deceased, and included 
therein the lots sold by the widow Rosa Venal to appellants Rodriguez. Later, 
the administrator petitioned the Court to declare as heirs of the deceased 
Gavino, his alleged nephews Zoilo and Andres Reyes (children of the late Luciano 
de los Reyes) and Martin Macatangay (son of Luciano's daughter Josef a Reyes, a 
predeceased sister of Andres and Zoilo Reyes). </p>
<p>The declaration of heirship was opposed by the appellants Rodriguez, since it 
would undermine their title by purchase from Gavino's widow, Rosa Venal. The 
Rodriguezes claimed that the widow was the sole true heir of Gavino Villota y 
Reyes; that Luciano Reyes (father of claimants Zoilo and Andres Reyes and 
grandfather of Martin Macatangay) was an illegitimate offspring of Gavino's 
mother (Maxima de los Reyes) of an unknown father, before Maxima married Juan 
Villota, father of the late Gavino Villota y Reyes.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance rejected the opposition of appellants herein, and 
by order of April 27, 1953, held: (1) that the heirship of Zoilo and Andres 
Reyes and of Martin Macatangay was <em>res judicata</em> in view of the decision 
of the same Court in Civil Case No. 4656, Basilia Coronel <em>vs</em>. Rosa 
Venal, Mariano Rodriguez and Concepcion Rodriguez, which decision was affirmed 
by the Court of Appeals in CA-GR No. 6880-R; (2) that the order appointing Zoilo 
Reyes as administrator of Gavino's estate established the relationship that the 
said decedent bore to Andres and Zoilo Reyes; and (3) that Luciano de los Reyes, 
while born illegitimate, had been <em>legitimated</em> by the marriage of his 
mother, Maxima de los Reyes, to Juan Villota and became thus capable of 
inheriting from his brother Gavino; hence the descendants of Luciano were 
entitled to inherit to the exclusion of the widow.</p>
<p>The Rodriguez oppositors appealed to the Court of Appeals. The latter, by 
decision of April 17, 1954 (CA-GR No. 11553-R), affirmed that of the inferior 
court, on the ground that the prior adjudication in Civil Case No. 4656 of the 
Court of First Instance of Tayabas, sustained by the Court of Appeals in a final 
judgment rendered in G. R. No. 6880-R, constituted <em>estoppel</em> by judgment 
on the fact that Zoilo Reyes, his brother Andres and his sister Josefa (now 
represented by her son, Martin Macatangay), were the heirs of the deceased.</p>
<p>We granted <em>certiorari</em> to review this decision of the Court of 
Appeals.</p>
<p>The prior adjudication upon which both Courts below relied, as conclusively 
establishing the successional rights of claimants Reyes and Macatangay, was a 
finding made by the Courts of First Instance of Quezon, Tayabas, in deciding 
Civil Case No. 4656 of that Court. That suit was brought by one Basilia Coronel 
against Rosa Venal (widow of Gavino Villota y Reyes), Mariano Rodriguez and 
Concepcion Rodriguez (the last two being the oppositors-appellants in1 the case 
now before us). The plaintiff therein sought to annul and set aside the 
conveyance of lot No. 46 of the Sariaya Cadastre, made by Rosa Venal in favor of 
the Rodriguezes on July 22, 1939, on the strength of a prior sale in favor of 
said plaintiff, Basilia Coronel, made by the spouses Gavino Villota and Rosa 
Venal in 1929. The Court of First Instance annulled the sale of the lot in favor 
of oppositors Rodriguez, and directed the Register of Iteeds to cancel the 
corresponding certificate and issue another in the name of Basilia Coronel. In 
the course of its decision, the Court found that Rosa Venal included lot 46 by 
mistake among the properties she sold to the Rodriguezes; but it also made the 
following pronouncement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When she (Rosa Venal) sold the whole property again in 1939 alone, she was 
not its exclusive owner for Gavino Reyes left nephews in the persons of Andres 
and Zoilo Reyes, children of his deceased brother Luciano Reyes. In the law and 
order of succession, brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces precede the 
surviving spouse." (Exhibit G.; Appendice 1, Appellee's brief. P. 
.71.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals, where it was docketed as CA-G. 
R. No. 6880-R. In due time. the Fourth Division of said Court rendered judgment 
affirming the decision of the Court of First Instance, holding that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Assuming as fact the due execution of Exhibit B, the instrument through 
which Rosa Venal sold lot No. 46 to the defendants, no validity can be given 
thereto, for Rosa Venal could not have disposed then of that property, as it no 
longer belonged to her. Its inclusion in the sale must have been an obvious 
mistake. * * *</p>
<p>"That appellants' contention that Rosa Venal is liable to them for the value 
of lot No. 46 is preposterous, because she asserted, and we believe it to be 
true, that she sold it to none other than Basilia. Moreover, if that lot was 
really included in the sale, the least that can be said is that it was a 
mistake."</p></blockquote>
<p>But the Court of Appeals passed <em>sub silentio</em> the finding that the 
deceased Gavino Villota Reyes had left nephews who preceded his widow in the 
succession.</p>
<p>Upon these facts we hold that the finding of the Court of First Instance in 
its case No. 4656, as to Zoilo and Andres Reyes, could not give rise to <em>res 
judicata</em> nor to <em>estoppel</em>. Both bars to relitigation require that 
the later suit should be between the same parties or their privies, a condition 
that does not obtain in the present case. The first litigation was between the 
appellants Rodriguez and Basilia Coronel; while the second case, now before us, 
is between the Administrator of the estate of Gavino Villota y Reyes, on the one 
hand, and the Rodriguezes on the other. Obviously, there is no identity of 
parties.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals sought to turn the objection by holding that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It could be said that the herein administrator and the plaintiff in that 
case (i.e., Basilia Coronel) are privies of the deceased Gavino Reyes, while 
Mariano Rodriguez and Concepcion Rodriguez, the herein oppositors-appellants, 
were the defendants-appellants in said civil case."</p></blockquote>
<p>The error in this reasoning lies in the assumption that the rule of 
condusiveness of judgments can operate against or in favor of different 
plaintiffs, provided they are both privies of a common predecessor (causante), 
when in reality the rule requires them to be privies of each other, and such 
privity must be by title <em>subsequent</em> to the commencement of the first 
action or proceeding (Rule. 39, section 44(b); 30 Am. Jur., 957; I Moran, 
Commentaries on the Rules of Court, pp. 869-870 and cases therein cited). The 
administrator of Gavino Villota y Reyes is not a successor in interest of 
Basilia Coronel; if at all, the interest he represents is anterior to that of 
Basilia (who was Gavino's vendee) and hence, it can not be affected favorably or 
unfavorably by the adjudication in her suit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Similarly, a judgment in. favor of or adverse to the interest or title of an 
assignee or grantee, rendered in an action to which the assignor or grantor is 
not a party, is not conclusive as between the assignor or grantor and the 
succesful assailant of the assignee's or grantee's interest or title." 
(Kapiolani Estate <em>vs</em>. Atcherly, 50 L. Ed., 1229; Radford <em>vs</em>. 
Meyers, 58 L. Ed, 454; Bergson <em>vs</em>. Hood, 116 ALE 951)</p></blockquote>
<p>It stands to reason that as the finding that Zoilo and Andres Reyes were 
nephews of Gavino Reyes was made in an action wherein Gavino was not a party, it 
can not be invoked by the appellants Rodriguez against him or his administrator; 
and if this be so, neither should said pronouncement be invoked by the 
administrator against the Rodriguezes, for estoppels must be mutual (Andres 
<em>vs</em>. Pimentel, 21 Phil., 434).</p>
<p>Finally, it is well to note that the finding relied upon is merely to the 
effect that Andres and Zoilo Reyes were nephews of Gavino, but it does not state 
that they were <em>legitimate</em> nephews, as is necessary in order to enable 
them to succeed ahead of the widow; and that such finding was not confirmed by 
the Court of Appeals, that rendered the final judgment setting at rest the prior 
litigation.</p>
<p>Neither is <em>estoppel</em> or <em>res judicata</em> derivable from the 
pronouncement contained in the order of September 2, 1948, appointing Zoilo 
Reyes as administrator of the estate of Gavino Villota y Reyes. The statement 
therein that "the persons nearest of kin to the deceased are his surviving 
spouse and the children of Zoilo Reyes, the herein petitioner, and Andres Reyes, 
both of whom are brothers of the deceased" was entirely extraneous and 
unnecessary (obiter) for the purpose of the order itself; so much so that the 
finding is being modified by the order of declaration of heirs, dated April 27, 
1953, now under appeal. In addition, there is no showing that the 
oppositors-appellants were served with notice of the petition to appoint the 
administrator, nor that they appeared at the hearing thereof.</p>
<p>There being no estoppel, contrary to the holding of the Court of Appeals, we 
are forced to examine the correctness of the finding of the Court of First 
Instance that Luciano de los Reyes (father of claimants Zoilo.and Andres Reyes, 
and grandfather of Martin Macatangay) was a <em>legitimated</em> son of Juan 
Villota and Maxima de los Reyes, and therefore, a legitimate brother, for all 
intents and! purposes, of the decedent Gayino Villota y Reyes, with right to 
succeed the latter in the absence of descedents and ascendants. The point was 
not touched upon by the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>It is unquestioned that according to his baptismal certificate, Exhibit 3, 
Luciano de los Reyes was born on January 7, 1871, of Maxima de los Reyes, 
single, and an unknown father (padre: desconocido); and said certificate 
adds:</p>
<p>"Legitimadad: No legitimado" (legitimo).</p>
<p>It is also admitted that almost two (2) years later, on Noveiriber 26, 1872, 
Juan Villota was eanonically married to Maxima de los Reyes, mother of Luciano 
(Exhibit K). According to the governing law of the time (1871), which was the 
Law of XI of Toro, in order that this marriage should produce the legitimation 
of Luciano, it must appear (1) that Luciano was the son, not only of Maxima, but 
of Juan Villota as well; (2) that Juan Villota and Maxima de los Reyes could 
contract marriage with each other, "justamente y sin dispensacion" when Luciano 
was conceived or when he was born; and (3) that Juan Villota should have 
acknowledged Luciano to be his natural son, though such recognition need not be 
express but may be implied from the acts of the alleged father (Allarde vs. 
Abaya, 57 Phil., 909). Plainly, the marriage is by itself no proof of. 
recognition, for Juan Villota might have been ignorant of Luciano's birth 
(Siguiong <em>vs</em>. Siguiong, 8 Phil., 5).</p>
<p>Now, the record before us is totally barren of proof as to any personal acts 
of recognition by Juan Villota with regard to Luciano; nor is there evidence on 
the question of who was Luciano's father. The Court of First Instance cites no 
proof; and the evidence of the appellees is merely to the effect that Gavino and 
Luciano were "full blood brothers", which is, only a: conclusion of the 
witnesses and irrelevant to the issue .of legitimation or recognition, 
especially under the laws of Toro. For under the Law XI the son had to be 
acknowledged by the parent and by no other person, said law expressly requiring 
"<em>con tanto que el padre le reconozca por su hijo</em>." (Sent Trib. Sup. of 
Spain, 23 June 1868). It is well to recall here that the conferment of the 
status of acknowledged natural child by acts of the members of the parent's 
<em>family</em> (authorized by Article 135, No. 2, of the Spanish Civil Code of 
1889) was entirely without precedent in the pre-Codal legislation of Spain and 
its colonies.</p>
<p>Not only have the appellees failed to prove that their predecessor Luciano de 
los Reyes was the offspring of Juan Villota, or that the latter in any way 
acknowledged Luciano as his son; but these are on record plain indicia that such 
acknowledgment or legitimation never took place. Thus Exhibit J, the certificate 
of the marriage of Luciano de los Reyes with Agripina Gragasa in 1898, expressly 
recites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * case" por palabras de presente y con licencia dada por el R. P. Fr. 
Miguel Gonzalez, en esta Iglesia de mi cargo segun rito de Nuestra Madre 
Iglesia, a <em>Luciano de los Reyes</em>, hijo de Maxima de los Reyes, del 
pueblo de Candelaria del barangay No. 25; con <em>Agripina Gragasa</em>, india 
soltera, hija de Engracio Gragasa y Apolinario Abordo, * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be noticed that (1) the. identity of Luciano's father remains unknown 
down to 1898, since only his mother's name is recorded; (2) that his mother is 
not described as widowed; and (3) that Luciano did not bear the surname of his 
alleged father, Juan Villota. These facts are incompatible with the theory that 
Juan Villota had acknowledged and legitimated Luciano. Had he done so, there 
would be no reason why Luciano should not bear the paternal surnames to which 
the legitimation entitled him, or why he should have withheld the name of Juan 
Villota as his father on such a solemn occasion. The Spanish law, from the Fuero 
Real down to the Code of 1889, strictly and consistently adhered to the maxim of 
the Canon Law (the Decretal of Pope Alexander III) that those legitimated by 
marriage of the parents should be considered legitimated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In view of the social importance given to 
legitimacy, especially in the, past century, it is inconceivable that Luciano, 
if really legitimated by both parents, should prefer to hide his paternity and 
appear as illegitimate before the woman he was to marry.</p>
<p>In the absence of reliable proof that Juan Villota had begotten and 
acknowledged Luciano de los Reyes as his natural son,, his legitimation can not 
be declared duly proved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To hold otherwise would make possible the admission of fraudulent claims 
made after the decease of a married couple, based upon an allegation that the 
claimant was the fruit 'of illicit relations prior to their marriage, and 
without any attempt to show that the putative father had ever recognized the 
claimant as his child or even knew of its existence; and the mere possibility 
that such claimants might present themselves would, cast doubt and confusion on 
many inheritances, and open wide the door to a form of fraud which the 
legitimate heirs would find great difficulty in combating." (Siguiong vs. 
Siguiong, <em>supra.</em>)</p></blockquote>
<p>And without such legitimation, Luciano could not succeed to the estate of 
Gavino Villota y Reyes, in view of Article 943 of the Civil Code of 1889 (later 
clarified by Article 992 of the new Civil Code):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 943. A natural child has no right to succeed ab intestate ligitimate 
children and relatives (of the father or mother who has acknowledged, it; nor 
shall such children or relatives so inherit from the natural child."</p>
<p>"Art. 992. (New Civil Code) An illegitimate child has no right to inherit ab 
intestate from the legitimate children and relatives of his. father or mother; 
nor shall such children qr relatives inherit in the same manner from the 
illegitimate child."</p></blockquote>
<p>And the disqualification of Luciano to succeed Gavino Villota extended under 
these articles to Luciano's own progeny, Zoilo and Andres and Martin Macatangay, 
since they could not represent him (Sent. Tribunal Supremo of Spain, 24 June 
1897; 7 Manresa, Comentarios (6th ed.) pp. 140-141).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we hold: </p>
<p>(1) That a vendor or his administrator may not be concluded,, favorably or 
unfavorably, by a prior judgment rendered in an action between his vendee and 
other parties;</p>
<p>(2) That a finding in an order appointing an administrator for a decedent's 
estate, to the effect that certain persons are the next of kin of the deceased, 
can not conclude persons who were not as yet parties to the proceeding ;</p>
<p>(3) That a natural child, not recognized as required by the law XI of Toro, 
is not legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents; and therefore, he 
is barred from succeeding to the legitimate issue of said parents.</p>
<p>(4) That such disqualification to inherit extends to the descendants of the 
unrecognized natural child.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is reversed and the 
declaration of heirs made on April 27, 1953, by the Court of First Instance 6f 
Quezon in Special Proceedings No. 3029, is revoked and set aside. Let the 
records be remanded to the Court of origin for a new hearing to determine the 
true intestate heirs of the deceased Gavino Villota y Reyes, to the exclusion of 
claimants Reyes and Macatangay, in accordance with law and this opinion. So 
ordered.</p>
