				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition for certiorari to annul an order dated June 3, 1959, of the Court of 
First Instance of Ilocos Norte, Hon. Delfin B. Flores, presiding, issuing an 
alias writ of execution in G. R. No. L-6831, entitled "Primo Quetulio, 
plaintiff-appellant, versus Teresa Dimaya, et al., intervenors."
<p>On November 6, 1956, the Supreme Court promulgated a "Resolution on the 
Motion to Reconsider" in G.R. No. L-6831, amending the dispositive part of its 
original decision. The amended dispositive part reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of all the foregoing, the decision appealed from is modified in the 
sense that any share in Parcels 67 and 68 of Exhibit 'K' (In San Juan and San 
Leon, Banna, Ilocos Norte) that would correspond to the heirs of the late Juan 
Ver, that is to say, to. Maria Ver, and to Florentina Ver, and their successors, 
in interest, (Vicente Ver, Natividad Ver, Geronimo Florentino Ver, and 
intervenors-appellees, surnamed Tesoro, children of Carmen Ver) as heirs of the 
late D. Leon Ver, is hereby declared to he the property of appellant herein, 
Primo Quetulio, and the value of the fruits corresponding to such undivided, 
interest, shall be determined and deducted from the damages awarded against said 
appellant. In all other respects, the decision appealed from is affirmed.</p>
<p>"Let the records be remanded to the court below for further proceedings in 
conformity with this opinion. No costs in this instance." (Par. 3, Petition for 
Certiorari) </p></blockquote>
<p>(An examination of flie original decision promulgated on June 29, 1956 
reveals that Primo Quetulio, petitioner herein, was ordered to pay the 
defendants and the intervenors the sum of P11,500 per annum from 1945 onwards). 
The records of G.R. No. L-6831, <em>supra</em>, having been remanded to the 
Court of First Instance, this court, upon motion of respondent herein Evaristo 
Ver, issued a writ of execution against all the properties of petitioner herein. 
Subsequently, on July 15, 1958, upon petition of Quetulio, the court set the 
case for hearing and cancelled the writ of execution. But on June 1, 1959, upon 
motion of counsel for defendants and the intervenors, the lower court issued 
another wrder continuing the writ of execution previously issued and including 
in the levy against the properties of petitioner his undivided interests in Lots 
67 and 68. Reason for this order is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the proper determination of the shares of the plaintiff Primo Quetulio 
and (he value of the fruits of the portion corresponding to him in lot 67 and 
68, there is, therefore, a need for partition proceedings. But assuming that 
after the partition proceedings, the shave of Primo Quetulio shall have been 
determined, just the same, it will be attached lo be sold at public auction to 
satisfy, the damages. Therefore, in order to avoid multiplicity of suits, that 
is, to do away with the filing of a partition proceedings between plaintiff 
Primo Quetulio on one hand and the co-heirs of Juan Ver on the other, so as to 
determine the corresponding shares of each in these two lots, it is the 
considered opinion of this Court to continue the writ of execution and to 
include in the levied properties of the plaintiff's undivided share in lots 67 
and 68. If the defendants and intervenors will purchase the said interest of 
Quetulio in these two lots, being relatives, they will know what to do with the 
same." </p></blockquote>
<p>After a hearing on Quetulio's motion for reconsideration of said order, the 
court ordered on June 3, 1959, the issuance of the <em>alias</em> writ of 
execution. The ex-parte motion for reconsideration of the last order having been 
denied, petitioner filed this petition.</p>
<p>The sole issue is whether or not the decision of the Supreme Court in G. R. 
No. L-6831 is final and executory. The issue should be decided in the negative 
because: (1) The decision of the Supreme Court itself orders further proceedings 
by the lower court; (2) A partition proceedings in the court below is still 
necessary to determine Quetulio's interest in Lots Nos. 67 and 68; (3) The value 
of the fruits of said lots should be determined, as the same will be deducted 
from the damages awarded against Quetulio. (According to petitioner herein, 
respondents have been in possession of said lots for nine years already in 
September, 1959). The lower court cannot assume that the fruits of said lots 
will not completely pay for or reduce the damages awarded; and (4) Execution is 
being issued also against properties of Quetulio, other than said Lots No. 67 
and 68. How will the lower court know how much of said properties should be sold 
to satisfy the damages, if the actual amount of said damages is not first 
determined?</p>
<p>The above-enumerated circumstances indicate that there are still matters in 
the case left to be determined and settled before the judgment can be executed. 
The decision of the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-6831 did not yet acquire 
finality and is, therefore, not yet executory (Ignacio, et al., <em>vs</em>. 
Hilario, et al., 76 Phil., 605; Cu Unjieng e Hijos <em>vs</em>. Mabalacat Sugar 
Co., 70 Phil., 380).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of the lower court dated June 3, 1959 issuing the 
<em>alias</em> writ of execution, is hereby set aside. No costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, 
J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Order set aside.</em></p></div>
