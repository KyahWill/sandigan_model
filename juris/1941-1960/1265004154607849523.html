				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an action for partition&nbsp; of three parcels of land situated&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; Tayug, Pangasinan based on the claim that they are&nbsp; owned in common&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">pro indiviso</span> by plaintiffs and&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; Plaintiffs&nbsp;&nbsp; also&nbsp; pray&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages&nbsp; representing&nbsp; unenjoyed&nbsp; profits from&nbsp; 1916 to&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a period&nbsp; of 33&nbsp; years.<br><br>The defense&nbsp; of defendant&nbsp; is that said lands were given to him and his&nbsp; wife&nbsp; by his parents&nbsp; Basilio&nbsp; Espique and Maria&nbsp; Diaz as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; his&nbsp; grandfather Julian&nbsp; Espique by&nbsp; way&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; donation <em>propter nuptias</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1906 and since then he and his&nbsp; wife have been in&nbsp; possession and enjoyment thereof for a period of 44 years adversely and&nbsp; without interruption.&nbsp; He pleaded&nbsp; prescription and lack of cause of&nbsp; action.<br><br>On the date set for hearing, the parties submitted a stipulation of&nbsp; facts wherein,&nbsp; among other&nbsp; things, they agreed&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; that plaintiffs&nbsp;&nbsp; and defendant are the&nbsp; legitimate children&nbsp; of Basilio&nbsp; Espique&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria Diaz, the former&nbsp; being the legitimate son&nbsp; of Julian Espique,&nbsp; and (2) that the properties in question were donated <em>propter nuptias</em>&nbsp; by&nbsp; Julian&nbsp; Espique and the spouses Basilio Espique and Maria Diaz in&nbsp; favor of Jacinto&nbsp; Espique and Victorina Abenojar, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; donation&nbsp; was merely&nbsp; made in a private document executed on&nbsp; May&nbsp; 8, 1906.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; above stipulation of&nbsp; facts, defendant submitted a&nbsp; motion to dismiss, to which plaintiffs filed a reply and, thereafter,&nbsp; the court rendered judgment finding that plaintiffs' complaint has no&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of action&nbsp; it appearing that the properties which&nbsp; are sought&nbsp; to be partitioned were donated to defendant since 1906 who has been&nbsp;&nbsp; in possession thereof&nbsp; adversely&nbsp; and continuously for more than forty&nbsp; years&nbsp; and, hence, has acquired title thereto by prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the court dismissed the action without pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs.&nbsp; Plaintiffs appealed from this&nbsp; decision in due course but&nbsp; the&nbsp; Co,urt of Appeals&nbsp; certified the case to this Court on the ground&nbsp; that it&nbsp; merely involves questions of law.<br><br>The question to be&nbsp; determined&nbsp; is whether the&nbsp; lower court erred in&nbsp; concluding that plaintiffs'&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; states no cause of action&nbsp; because, considering its allegations and the stipulation of facts&nbsp; submitted by the&nbsp; parties, the properties in question were donated&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendant by his predecessors-in-interest way back in 1906 and&nbsp; since then he has&nbsp; been in possession and enjoyment thereof adversely,&nbsp; openly&nbsp; and&nbsp; without interruption&nbsp; up to 1949,&nbsp; or&nbsp; for a period of&nbsp; more&nbsp; than forty&nbsp; years.<br><br>Plaintiffs sustain the affirmative&nbsp; on the plain plea that the deed of&nbsp; donation which defendant claims as the basis of&nbsp; his&nbsp; title being one&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; consideration of&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; is null&nbsp; and void and as sueh could not&nbsp; have conveyed&nbsp; or transferred any title, right or interest over the&nbsp; lands&nbsp; in question to defendant because it has not&nbsp; been executed&nbsp; in a&nbsp; public document.&nbsp; And&nbsp; even if said&nbsp; donation may&nbsp; be said to be the&nbsp; basis of acquisitive prescription, plaintiffs contend that there is no&nbsp; evidence whatever showing that the possession of defendant has been&nbsp; continuous, public open&nbsp; and adverse for more than 30 years as found&nbsp;&nbsp; by the trial court.<br><br>There is no question&nbsp; that the donation&nbsp; in&nbsp; question is invalid&nbsp; because it involves an immovable property and the donation was not made&nbsp; in a public document as required&nbsp; by Article 633 of the old Civil Code,&nbsp; in connection with Article 1328 of the same Code (concerning gifts&nbsp; <em>propter nuptias</em>), but it does not follow that said donation may not&nbsp; serve as&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of acquisitive prescription when on the strength&nbsp;&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; the&nbsp; donee has&nbsp; taken&nbsp; possession of the property adversely&nbsp; and in the concept of owner, for, as this Court well said: "While the&nbsp; verbal donation, under which the defendants,&nbsp; and his predecessors in&nbsp; interest have been in possession of the lands&nbsp; in question, is&nbsp; not&nbsp; effective as a transfer of title, yet it is a circumstance which may&nbsp; explain the&nbsp; adverse and&nbsp; exclusive character of the&nbsp; possession"&nbsp; (Pensader&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Pensader, 47 Phil., 959; See also Dimaliwat <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Dimaliwat, 55 Phil.,&nbsp; 673-680).&nbsp; That is also an&nbsp; action for&nbsp; partition.&nbsp; It was shown that the donation of the property&nbsp; was made&nbsp; not even in a private document but only verbally,&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; also shown&nbsp; that the defendants,&nbsp; through their prodecessors-in-interest,&nbsp; were in&nbsp;&nbsp; adverse and continuous possession of the lands for a period&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; over&nbsp; 30 years.&nbsp; Yet, the court decided the case in favor of defendants&nbsp; on the ground of acquisitive prescription.&nbsp; There is also&nbsp; a&nbsp; close parallelism between the facts of .this case and the&nbsp; present.<br><br>It&nbsp; is true that no evidence&nbsp; was presented showing the character of&nbsp; the possession held by the&nbsp; defendant of the lands in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; but&nbsp; such&nbsp; is&nbsp; unnecessary&nbsp; considering the admissions&nbsp; made by plaintiffs&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the complaint and in the&nbsp; stipulation&nbsp; of facts.&nbsp; A careful&nbsp; analysis of the admissions made in both&nbsp; pleadings would at once reveal&nbsp; that defendant has been in open, adverse and continuous possession of&nbsp; said lands since at least 1916 up&nbsp; to&nbsp; 1949 or for a&nbsp; period of 33&nbsp;&nbsp; years.&nbsp; Thus, it appears&nbsp; in&nbsp; paragraphs 4&nbsp; and 5&nbsp; of the first cause&nbsp; of action that defendant has been&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession of the lands in&nbsp; question&nbsp; and has "appropriated&nbsp; unto himself&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole produce of&nbsp; the aforementioned&nbsp; parcels of land,&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1916 up to the present"&nbsp; so&nbsp; much so that plaintiffs prayed that they be given their share of the&nbsp;&nbsp; produce&nbsp; during said period by way of damages in the total amount of&nbsp; P22,000.<br><br>We do&nbsp; not need to stretch our mind to see that Under such allegations&nbsp; plaintiffs intended to&nbsp; convey the&nbsp; idea that defendant&nbsp; has possessed&nbsp; the lands openly, adversely and without&nbsp; interruption&nbsp; from 1916&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; 1949 for&nbsp; he&nbsp; is the one who has possessed&nbsp; them and reaped the whole&nbsp; benefit thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the character of the possession held by&nbsp; defendant during that period one cannot also deny that it is in the&nbsp;&nbsp; concept of owner considering that the lands were donated to&nbsp; him&nbsp; by&nbsp; his predecessors-in-interest on the occasion&nbsp; of his marriage even if&nbsp; the same was not embodied in a public&nbsp; instrument.&nbsp;&nbsp; The essential&nbsp; elements constituting&nbsp; acquisitive prescription are therefore present&nbsp; which negative the right&nbsp; of plaintiffs to ask for partition of said&nbsp; properties.&nbsp; On this point we find pertinent the following&nbsp; observation of&nbsp; the trial court.&nbsp; "Any person who claims&nbsp; right of&nbsp; ownership over immovable properties and does not&nbsp; invoke that right but&nbsp; instead tolerated&nbsp; others in possession for thirty years&nbsp; is guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; laches and negligence and he must suffer the consequences of his&nbsp;&nbsp; acts."<br><br>With regard to the&nbsp; contention that the trial court dismissed the&nbsp; case without&nbsp; first receiving the evidence the plaintiffs may desire to&nbsp; present in support of their contention, it is true that this right&nbsp; was reserved by the parties in the stipulation of&nbsp; facts and plaintiffs&nbsp; asked&nbsp; in&nbsp; their motion for reconsideration&nbsp; that they be given a&nbsp; chance to prove some additional facts, but they failed to state clearly&nbsp; what those facts are and the nature of the evidence they would like to&nbsp; present, for&nbsp; which reason the court denied their request. Undoubtedly, the trial court did not deem necessary any additional&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; considering the admissions&nbsp; made by the plainttiffs as&nbsp; above adverted&nbsp; to.<br><br>Considering the conclusion we have reached, we hold that the trial&nbsp; court did not err&nbsp; in this respect.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><em>Paras, C.
