				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The respondent in the&nbsp; above-entitled administrative case is charged&nbsp; with&nbsp; having appeared&nbsp; as lawyer in&nbsp; several&nbsp; civil,&nbsp; land registration and&nbsp; criminal cases in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Capiz,&nbsp; and&nbsp; having conducted trials&nbsp; therein, examining and 'cross-examining witnesses, moving for postponement of hearings and filing a notice and a record on appeal, after he was suspended from the practice of law by Judge Luis N.&nbsp; de Leon of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Capiz.&nbsp; The respondent&nbsp; does not deny that he appeared in the cases and on the&nbsp; occasions mentioned in the complaint filed&nbsp; against&nbsp; him&nbsp; before&nbsp; Us,&nbsp; but he alleges that&nbsp; the order suspending him from the&nbsp; practice of law is a part of a&nbsp; vindictive scheme or design of the complainant&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; persecute him&nbsp; systematically;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the order&nbsp; suspending him&nbsp; from&nbsp; the said practice of&nbsp; law&nbsp; was issued without due process&nbsp; of&nbsp; law and&nbsp; without giving him&nbsp; his day in&nbsp; court.<p>Upon the filing of the respondent's answer, complainant moved for a judgment on the pleadings, as the respondent&nbsp; had&nbsp; not&nbsp; denied the&nbsp; material&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; of the complaint.&nbsp; We did&nbsp; not,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; resolve&nbsp; this&nbsp; motion, but remanded the case to the Solicitor-General for investigation and report.&nbsp; The Solicitor-General in turn endorsed the case to the Provincial Fiscal of Gapiz for investigation and report.&nbsp; The Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp; as the acts of the respondent herein are related&nbsp; to his&nbsp; acts&nbsp; in relation to&nbsp; another&nbsp; case for&nbsp; contempt&nbsp; (People <em>vs.</em> Boanerjes Venturanza, G. R. No. L-7974), wherein respondent was ordered to pay&nbsp; a fine of P500, the&nbsp; case is now moot or&nbsp; academic and, therefore,&nbsp; recommended&nbsp; its dismissal. The Solicitor-General concurs in this recommendation.</p><p>When the case was submitted to this&nbsp; Court, respondent filed a reply&nbsp; to the report of the&nbsp; Solicitor-General,&nbsp; reiterating his claim that the order declaring his suspension from the&nbsp; practice of law is null and void, because it was issued without&nbsp; giving respondent opportunity to appear and defend himself.</p><p>The record discloses that on December 19, 1953, complainant Judge of First Instance&nbsp; of Capiz, entered an order requiring respondent to appear in court on December 21, 1953,&nbsp; at 9:00&nbsp; a.m., to show cause why&nbsp; he should not be&nbsp; dealth with severely and&nbsp; suspended&nbsp; from the&nbsp; practice of law for having sent the following telegram to the judge:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"COLLECT JUDGE DE LEON<br>CALIBO&nbsp; </p><p>REQUEST SET ASIDE YOUR ORDERS CONFISCATED BOND AND MY ARREST BEING VINDICTIVE ABUSE USE POWERS UNJUST MALICIOUS AS YOU ARE OFFENDED PARTY&nbsp; OTHERWISE&nbsp; WILL CHARGE&nbsp; YOU CRIMINALLY CIVILLY AND ADMINISTRATIVELY ... <br></p><p align="right">ATTY. TORRES"</p></blockquote><p>Respondent did not appear&nbsp; in court on December 21, 1953, as&nbsp; ordered.&nbsp; He&nbsp; merely submitted&nbsp; a medical certificate to the effect that he was&nbsp; sick.&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 25,&nbsp; 1956, he filed a motion&nbsp; praying that instead of appearing personally&nbsp; in&nbsp; court&nbsp; he should&nbsp; be allowed&nbsp; to file a written answer, because of pressure of work and because he was leaving for Manila for&nbsp; some important matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complainant took steps&nbsp; to&nbsp; have the respondent arrested,&nbsp; but the latter could not be located.&nbsp; The reason is thsft he had come to Manila.&nbsp; In his&nbsp; motion of December 25,&nbsp; 1953, however he says:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * * it is respectfully prayed that&nbsp; the promulgation of the decision&nbsp; in the&nbsp; contempt proceedings mentioned in&nbsp; said order be postponed to January,&nbsp; 1954, at 9:30 a.m. and&nbsp; if this&nbsp; is&nbsp; not possible&nbsp; he hereby&nbsp; waives to be present in the reading of&nbsp; said decision&nbsp; and if the decision is&nbsp; against him he&nbsp; hereby gives notice of his intention to&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (p. 14 of the Record.)</p></blockquote><p>As the complainant must have believed that respondent purposely' refused to appear, he entered the&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated December 29, 1953,&nbsp; ordering respondent&nbsp; "suspended from the practice of law&nbsp; in&nbsp; any court&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Islands from the date of the&nbsp; notification&nbsp; of this&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; until&nbsp; further action on the premises&nbsp; by the Honorable&nbsp; Supreme Court." It&nbsp; is this&nbsp; order, duly transmitted to&nbsp; Us,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is now before Us&nbsp; for final&nbsp; decision.</p><p>There is&nbsp; no question that defendant&nbsp; has&nbsp; violated&nbsp; the order of suspension; his&nbsp; appearances in court have not been denied by him in&nbsp; his answer or in his reply memorandum.&nbsp; The only defense&nbsp; put, up&nbsp; by him&nbsp; is that he has had no sufficient opportunity to defend himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find that&nbsp; this defense is&nbsp; without merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; His conduct upon receiving&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of December&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1953 shows that 'he did&nbsp; not like to appear&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaining judge.&nbsp;&nbsp; He refused&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear, alleging&nbsp; illness, and&nbsp; when the judge&nbsp; attempted to have him arrested, he escaped arrest and came to Manila.&nbsp; These&nbsp; acts of the respondent do not evince a desire to defend himself against the charges of contempt filed by the complaining judge against him. He also had waived his right to be present and contest the order in the court below.&nbsp; In view of his failure to appear and the waiver of this&nbsp; right, the complaining judge had no other recourse but to decide the charges against him ex-parte, in accordance with the last sentence of Section 29, Rule 127, cited by respondent himself in his reply memorandum.</p><p>It is, therefore, apparent that notwithstanding the fact that respondent&nbsp; had been suspended from the practice of law&nbsp; and was advised of this&nbsp; order of December 29, 1953, he openly defied the prohibition by&nbsp; appearing as a lawyer&nbsp; in&nbsp; court, defending cases, examining&nbsp; and&nbsp; cross-examining witnesses, filing pleadings and&nbsp; papers&nbsp; in relation to the cases he was defending.&nbsp;&nbsp; These things he had committed from January&nbsp; 25, 1954&nbsp; to June,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the date of the filing of the petition by the&nbsp; complainant in this Court.&nbsp; For all we know, notwithstanding ,the&nbsp; order, he&nbsp; has been&nbsp; continuously appearing for&nbsp; clients&nbsp; in the courts of justice and openly defying the order suspending him from the practice of law.</p><p>We&nbsp; desire to&nbsp; call attention to the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; courts' orders, however erroneous they may be, must be respected, especially by the bar or the lawyers who are themselves officers&nbsp; of the&nbsp; courts.&nbsp; Court orders are to be respected not because the judges who issue them should be respected, but because of the respect and consideration that should be&nbsp; extended&nbsp; to the judicial branch&nbsp; of the Government. This is absolutely essential if our Government&nbsp; is to be a government of laws and not of men.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respect must be had not because of the incumbents to the positions, but because of the authority that vests in them.&nbsp; Disrespect to judicial incumbents is disrespect to that branch of the Government to which&nbsp; they belong, as well as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the State which has instituted the judicial system.</p><p>In order to impress upon&nbsp; the members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bar the duty&nbsp; of respect towards&nbsp; judicial authorities, we&nbsp; have decided, after a careful deliberation,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the acts of the respondent, which were&nbsp; committed&nbsp; in open defiance&nbsp; of judicial authority, should not be allowed to go unpunished' In&nbsp; consonance with&nbsp; this&nbsp; desire,&nbsp; we hereby&nbsp; suspend&nbsp; respondent Jose y.&nbsp; Torres&nbsp; from the practice of law for a period of three months from the date he is notified of this decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; Copies&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; decision shall be furnished the courts where&nbsp; respondent has&nbsp; pending cases,&nbsp; for faithful compliance therewith.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J, B. L.</em>, and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
