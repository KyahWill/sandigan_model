				<H3>CECILIO M. LINO, PETITIONER, VS. VALERIANO E. FUGOSO, LAMBERTO JAVALERA, AND JOHN DOE, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS MAYOR, CHIEF OF POLICE AND OFFICER IN CHARGE OF MUNICIPAL JAIL, ALL OF THE CITY OF MANILA, RESPECTIVELY, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed in behalf of twelve 
persons alleged to be unlawfully detained by respondents Valeriano E. Fugoso, 
Lamberto Javalera and John Doe in their capacity as mayor, chief of police and 
officer in charge of the municipal jail of the City of Manila, respectively. It 
is alleged in respondents' return that ten of the petitioners had already been 
released, no sufficient evidence having been found to warrant their prosecution 
for inciting to sedition, but that the remaining two, Pascual Montaniel and 
Pacifico Deoduco, are being held in custody because of charges filed against 
them in the municipal court for unjust vexation and disobedience to police 
orders, respectively.
<p>After hearing, by minute-resolution we dismissed the case with respect to the 
ten petitioners already released and we ordered the release of the remaining 
two, Montaniel and Deoduco, without prejudice to a reasoned decision which we 
now proceed to render.</p>
<p>The case of the ten petitioners has become academic by their release. The 
purpose of a writ of habeas corpus is only to set them free. After they are 
freed, the writ is purposeless. If they have been tljie victims of illegal 
arrest or detention, they can have recourse to criminal actions in the proper 
courts.</p>
<p>As regards the remaining two petitioners, the pertinent facts as admitted at 
the hearing by respondents, are as follows: Pascual Montaniel was arrested 
without warrant by the police officers of Manila on November 8, 1946, for 
inciting to sedition, and Pacifico Deoduco, on November 7, 1946, for resisting 
arrest and disobedience to police orders. On November 11 when this petition for 
habeas corpus was filed, these two petitioners were still under arrest. They 
were thus held in confinement for three and four days, respectively, without 
warrants and without charges formally filed in court. The papers of their cases 
were not transmitted to the City Fiscal's office until late in the afternoon of 
November 11. Upon investigation by that office, no sufficient evidence was found 
to warrant the prosecution of Pascual Montaniel for inciting to sedition and of 
Pacifico Deoduco for resisting arrest, but both remained under custody because 
of informations filed with the municipal court charging Montaniel with unjust 
vexation and Deoduco with disobedience to an agent of a person in authority 
under the second paragraph of article 151 of the Revised Penal Code. These 
informations were filed on the same day when this case was heard before this 
Court, that is, on November 12, 1946. And so far, no warrants of arrest or 
orders of commitment are shown to have been issued by the municipal court 
pursuant to the informations thus filed.</p>
<p>Under these facts, the detention of Pacifico Deoduco and Pascual Montaniel is 
illegal. Even assuming that they were legally arrested without warrant on 
November 7 and 8, 1946, respectively, their continued detention became illegal 
upon the expiration of six hours without their having been delivered to the 
corresponding judicial authorities. (Article 125, Rev. Pen. Code, as amended by 
Act No. 3940.) Their cases were referred to the City Fiscal late in the 
afternoon of November 11, 1946, that is, four and three days, respectively, 
after they were arrested. The illegality of their detention was not cured by the 
filing of information against them, since no warrants of arrest or orders of 
commitment have been issued by the municipal court up to the hearing of this 
case before this Court.</p>
<p>It must be observed, in this connection, that in said informations, the two 
petitioners1 are charged with light offenses punishable by law with <i>arresto 
menor</i> or a fine ranging from 5 to 200 pesos or both, according to the second 
paragraphs of articles 151 and 287, respectively, of the Revised Penal Code. 
Under Rule 108, section 10, when the offense charged is of that character, "the 
judge with whom the complaint or information is filed, shall not issue any 
warrant or order for the arrest of the defendant, but shall order the latter to 
appear on the day and hour fixed in the order to answer to the complaint or 
information," although in particular instances he may also "order that a 
defendant charged with such offense be arrested and not released except upon 
furnishing bail." The general rule, therefore, is that when the offense charged 
is light the accused should not be arrested, except in particular instances when 
the court expressly so orders in the exercise of its discretion. In the instant 
case, the municipal court has not yet acted on the informations nor exercised 
its discretion to order the arrest of the two petitioners and, therefore, they 
are still detained not because of the informations filed against them but as a 
continuance of their illegal detention by the police officers. While an arrest 
may be made without warrant when there are reasonable grounds therefor (Rule 
109, section 6, Rules of Court), the prisoner cannot be retained beyond the 
period provided by law, unless a warrant is procured from a competent court. (4 
Am. Jur., p. 49; Diers <i>vs</i>. Mallon, 46 Neb., 121; 50 Am. St. Rep., 598; 
Burk <i>vs</i>. Howley, 179 Penn., 539; 57 Am. St. Rep., 607; Karner <i>vs</i>. 
Stump, 12 Tex. Civ. App., 460; 34 S. W., 656; Johnson <i>vs</i>. Americus, 46 
Ga., 80; Leger <i>vs</i>. Warren, L. R. A., 216-218 [Bk. 51.] It is obvious in 
the instant case that the City Fiscal had no authority to issue warrants of 
arrest (<i>vide</i> authorities cited above, and Hashim <i>vs</i>. Boncan and 
City of Manila, 71 Phil., 216) and was powerless to validate such illegal 
detention by merely filing informations or by any order of his own, either 
express or implied.</p>
<p>It is not necessary now to determine whether the City Fiscal is a judicial 
authority within the purview of article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as 
amended by Act No. 3940, for even if he were, the petitioners' case was referred 
to him long after the expiration of the six hours provided by law. And since the 
City Fiscal, unlike a judicial authority, has no power to order either the 
commitment or the release on bail of persons charged with penal offenses (Adm. 
Code, section 2460), the petitioners' further confinement after their case had 
been referred to the City Fiscal was but a mere continuation of their illegal 
detention by the police officers. In the eyes of the law, therefore, these 
prisoners should have been out of prison long before the informations were filed 
with the municipal court, and they should not be retained therein merely because 
of the filing of such informations it appearing particularly that the offenses 
charged are light and are not, as a general rule, grounds for arrest, under Rule 
108, section 10. Under such circumstances, only an order of commitment could 
legalize the prisoner's continued confinement, and no such order has ever been 
issued. Indeed, the municipal court could acquire jurisdiction over said 
prisoners only by the issuance of a warrant of arrest, an order of commitment or 
a writ of summons as provided in the aforementioned rule.</p>
<p>We reiterate the minute-resolution above mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>:</strong></p>
<p>The facts in this case can better be gathered from the pleadings. Copies of 
the petition and of the return, the latter with the annexes, accompany this 
opinion as appendices A and B.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>At the hearing of this case, counsel of both parties disclosed the additional 
fact that the twelve detainees in whose behalf these proceedings have been 
initiated after their arrest, were required to post a bail bond for their 
provisional release of P12,000 each.</p>
<p>The petition was filed in the morning of November 11, 1946. The case was 
heard the next morning, and in the evening of November 12, it was possible for 
this Court to obtain the necessary majority for the early disposal of this case, 
with the result that the two remaining detainees were then immediately released. 
The first ten were released by respondents in the very afternoon of the day when 
the petition was filed.</p>
<p>If we could only have our own way, we would have the case heard and disposed 
of in the very day the petition was filed, by expediting the procedure in the 
same way as we did when we ordered the release on habeas corpus of Special 
Prosecutor Liwag, in Tañada <i>vs</i>. Quirino (42 Off. Gaz., 934). The Rules of 
Court, which provide that the writ of habeas corpus may be issued at any hour in 
the day or at night, and the very nature of the writ, make imperative the 
immediate disposal of cases like the present one, if the remedy is to be 
effective and there is an earnest desire to avoid a failure of justice, 
especially as respondents are bent on exerting all the power and ability at 
their command to mock at the action of the courts, as exemplified by the case of 
Villavicencio <i>vs</i>. Lukban (39 Phil., 778-812).</p>
<p>At the hearing of this case, our attention was called at the significant fact 
that petitioner himself, the ten released detainees, and other persons who came 
to attend the hearing in this Court, were refused entrance in the Malacañan 
compound where the building of the Supreme Court is located. They were allowed 
to come in after we asserted that all the people are free to come to the Supreme 
Court which is an institution that belongs to them.</p>
<p>The present case offers one of the most shocking examples of official 
disregard for fundamental human rights, as guaranteed in our Constitution, and 
as is intended to be promoted and encouraged by the Charter of the United 
Nations.</p>
<p>While Carlos P. Romulo, the eloquent spokesman of the Republic of the 
Philippines in the General Assembly of the United Nations, is making world 
history with his courageous sponsorship of the independence of all subjugated 
peoples and countries and is making for our Republic the proud record as one of 
the staunchest champions of fundamental human rights, always placed in the 
forefront whenever there is a battle for freedom, it seems paradoxical that 
here, in Manila, in the very heart of our country, in the nucleus of our 
national culture, twelve humble, peaceful and law-abiding citizens, while in the 
peaceful exercise of their constitutional rights of freedom of expression and to 
peaceably assemble, the right to enlist public support in the pursuit of their 
right to a decent living wage, and the right to petition their own Government 
for the redress of their grievances, are abruptly interrupted in the exercise of 
their rights and violently hauled into prison as dangerous criminals.</p>
<p>Counsel for respondents tried to justify the unwarranted official invasion of 
private civil liberties by the ignorance of erring officials of the 
constitutional Bill of Rights. Such ignorance does not justify anything. It only 
aggravates the situation. It shows unpardonable dereliction of duty and 
recklessness of responsible high authorities.</p>
<p>It is a universal rule that ignorance of the law does not exempt anyone from 
any responsibility for violating it. Peace officers are duty bound to know the 
law. They are also known as law officers, because it is their essential function 
to enforce the laws. They form part of the Executive Department of our 
Government, the department whose primary function is to execute the laws. No 
peace officers should be allowed to enter in the actual performance of his 
functions without first acquiring the indispensable knowledge of the laws they 
are called upon to enforce. At least they ought to know the Constitution, a copy 
of which they should always carry in their pockets for immediate consultation, 
with the same fidelity as the priests stick to their breviary of prayers. They 
should be compelled to learn by heart the Bill of Rights, if possible, commit to 
memory all its provisions. Peace officers are supposed, not only to enforce the 
laws, but also to protect the citizens in their rights, and in order that they 
may perform this duty, they should first know what these rights are. Without 
that knowledge, they become a menace to social order. If it is dangerous to Jet 
a person drive an automobile when that person does not know how to drive it, it 
is no less dangerous to entrust the enforcement of laws to armed individuals who 
are ignorant of them.</p>
<p>It has been alleged that the twelve detainees were not deprived of their 
personal liberty absolutely, because they were allowed to enjoy provisional 
release upon a bail of P12,000 each. If they choose not to post said bail, they 
cannot complain for having to remain in prison.</p>
<p>If the detention was illegal, and there is no doubt about it, respondents 
themselves admitting the illegality as to the ten detainees they released before 
the hearing of this case, the fact that respondents required them to post bail 
does not legalize their illegal detention. The bail requirement tends only to 
show respondents' stubbornness in insisting to enforce an illegal power to have 
the detainees under an involuntary control.</p>
<p>But even in the false hypothesis that respondents could require the detainees 
to post bail for their provisional release, the fact that respondents fixed the 
large amount of P12,000 for each, seems an unbelievable sarcasm.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the twelve detainees joined the workers' strike in a 
desperate endeavor to secure a decent living wage. They went into strike because 
with what they were being paid for their daily labor they had not enough to make 
both ends meet. At the time of their arrest, they were not even earning the 
insufficient salary or wage against which they were protesting by means of 
strike. If those persons were not earning enough to live as decent human beings, 
and at the time of their detention they were not receiving even the miserable 
pittance they were complaining of, is it not an insulting joke to require them 
to raise each P12,000 for bail, an amount, which even we, the members of the 
Supreme Court, occupying the highest ranks in our judicial system, and receiving 
the highest salary allowed by law to a judicial officer, could not raise with 
the urgency required by the situation of a man who is deprived of his personal 
freedom?</p>
<p>It is also alleged that the officers who arrested the detainees believe that 
the latter committed sedition. Respondents themselves confess that the detainees 
did not commit such crime. Sedition is the crime usually resorted to by tyrants 
as a pretext to silence or suppress those persons who have the firmness of 
character to oppose them and expose their abuses. Socrates was sentenced to 
drink hemlock for the sedition of giving freedom and wings to the Greek thought 
in his painstaking philosophical search for truth. Because he preached the 
gospel of human brotherhood, Jesus was crucified for sedition.</p>
<p>The tyrants of one-fourth of a century ago, who controlled the situation in 
the Philippines—tyrants are wild animals that may appear in any 
country—following the foot-steps of their predecessors in other places, tried to 
smash the crusade for clean government, which was our lot to wage in one of the 
newspapers of Manila, by prosecuting us for the crime of sedition. (United 
States <i>vs</i>. Perfecto and Mendoza, 43 Phil., 58, 62-64.) The following 
paragraphs in the decision of the Supreme Court in that case, seem to us to ring 
with trenchant actuality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the citizens of a state become convinced that the administration of the 
affairs of their government is not carried on in accordance with the law, or is 
not conducted for the best interest of all concerned, they have not only a right 
but it is their duty to present the cause of their grievances to the public, and 
the free press of the state usually affords the best avenue for that purpose. To 
that end, the organic laws of all modern free states have wisely provided that 
'no law shall be passed, abridging the freedom of the press' and that no person 
shall be punished except for an abuse of that freedom. The interest of civilized 
society and the maintenance of good government demand a full and free discussion 
of all affairs of public interest. Complete liberty to comment upon the 
administration of the Government, as well as the conduct of public men, is 
necessary for free speech. The people are not obliged, under modern civilized 
governments, to speak of the conduct of their officials, of their servants, in 
whispers or with bated breath. (United States <i>vs</i>. Bustos, 37 Phil., 
731.)</p>
<p>"The right to assemble and petition the Government, and to make requests and 
demands upon public officials, is a necessary consequence of republican and 
democratic institutions, and the complement of the right of free speech. (United 
States <i>vs</i>. Bustos, <i>supra</i>.)</p>
<p>"The freedom of the press comsists in the right to publish the truth, with 
good motives and for justifiable ends, although said publication may be 
offensive to the Government, to the courts, or to individuals.</p>
<p>"Chief Justice Marshall of the Supreme Court of the United States, in 
discussing the freedom of the press, said: 'The spirit of the constitution and 
the opinion of the people cannot be curbed by those who administer the 
Government. Among those principles which are held most sacred by the people of 
America, there is none more deeply rooted in the public mind than that of the 
liberty of the press.'</p>
<p>"Mr. Daniel Webster had occasion to discuss the same question. He said: 'It 
is important to safeguard to the utmost the right to free speech and the free 
press. It is the ancient and constitutional right of our people to judge public 
matters and public men. It is such a self-evident right as the right to breathe 
the air and to walk on the surface of the earth. I will defend this high 
constitutional prerogative in time of war, in time of peace, and all the time. 
Dead or alive I shall maintain it.'</p>
<p>"It is the particular duty of the people of the state to zealously maintain 
the right to express freely, either verbally or by publication, their honest 
convictions regarding the acts of public officials and the governing class. If 
the people of a free state should give up the right of free speech; if they are 
daunted by fear and threats, and abdicate their convictions; if the governing 
body of the state could silence all the voices except those that extol their 
acts; if nothing relating to the conduct of the governing class can reach the 
people except that which will uphold the men in power, then we may well say 
'Good-bye' to our liberties forever. While under such circumstances free 
governments may still be maintained, their life, their soul, and their 
essentials will be gone. If the publication of the conduct of public officials 
annoys them, let them examine their own act and determine the fundamental cause 
of the complaint. Even during the time of the illustrious Voltaire, he expressed 
the opinion that 'tolerance was never the cause of internal strife in the state, 
but, on the contrary, the pursuit of intolerance has covered the world with 
blood. The tyrants of our thoughts have caused the greater part of the 
misfortunes of the world.'</p>
<p>"Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson in discussing the question before us, said: 'If 
there were a country where knowledge could not be spread without incurring the 
penalty of the law; where there is no free speech, where correspondence and 
publicity are violated, that country would not be civilized, but it would be 
barbarous.'</p>
<p>"Mr. Henry Ward Beecher on one occasion said: 'The term "free" is akin to the 
wind that blows over the regions infected with malaria and exposes to the light 
the germs of the disease. When the freedom of speech is curtailed, infection 
sets in and death quickly follows."</p></blockquote>
<p>Our schoolboys are no more compelled to count "Ichi, ni, san, si," to sing 
"Hamabe No Uta," to salute "ohayoo," or "kombanwa," or to intersperse their talk 
with "arigatoo" or "sayoonara." No more lecturer is teaching us the "tyu no yu" 
and flower arrangement as the highest expressions of culture. The political 
philosophy of "Daitoa Kyoeiken" (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, under 
the Japanese hegemony) has banished as unwanted nightmare. The voice of the 
Nippon geo-politicians preaching "Hakko Ichiu," the Emperor's way, the universal 
brotherhood under the benevolent guidance of the direct descendant of Amaterasu 
Omikami, we do not hear any more. The bowlegged and be-sworded samurai 
successors, indoctrinated in the traditions of Bushido knighthood, ceased to 
plunder, to rape, and to cut throats in our midst. Our sleep is no more 
disturbed by the hobnail terror stalking in our sidewalks at midnight. The 
public bowings to brutal sentries, and by high officials and employees of the 
government towards the Imperial Palace at Tokyo, are no more. But it seems, as 
exemplified in this case, that the feudalistic ideology behind all occupation 
facts and acts has left its pernicious virus in our soil.</p>
<p>The wanton disregard shown by those responsible for the arrest to the rights 
of the twelve detainees, those rights being among the fundamental ones 
guaranteed by the constitution, cannot be explained otherwise.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no legal ground to disturb or obstruct the twelve 
detainees in their absolutely lawful and peaceful activities, and much less to 
deprive them of their personal freedom and then keep them in jail for an 
indefinite period of time, only interrupted upon the filing of a petition for a 
writ of habeas corpus in this case.</p>
<p>It is our opinion that those government officers who are responsible for the 
detention and confinement of the twelve detainees, depriving them of personal 
liberty without due process of law, as guaranteed by the Constitution, are 
liable for prosecution under article 124 of the Revised Penal Code which 
provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Arbitrary detention</i>.—Any public officer or employee who, without 
legal grounds, detains a person, shall suffer:</p>
<p>"1. The penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision 
correccional</i> in its minimum period, if the detention has not exceeded three 
days;</p>
<p>"2. The penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium and maximum 
periods, if the detention has continued more than three but not more than 
fifteen days;</p>
<p>"3. The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i>, if the detention has continued for 
more than fifteen days but not more than six months; and</p>
<p>"4. That of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, if the detention shall have exceeded 
six months.</p>
<p>"The commission of a crime, or violent insanity or any other ailment 
requiring the compulsory confinement ofc the patient in a hospital, shall be 
considered legal grounds for the detention of any person."</p></blockquote>
<p>But even if the detention in question was made "for some legal ground," a 
conjecture in support of which no sufficient ground appears in this case, still 
those who made the arrest are liable for prosecution under article 125 of the 
Revised Penal Code, because they failed to deliver the twelve detainees to the 
proper judicial authorities within the period of six hours after detention. Said 
article is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Delay in the delivery of detained persons to the proper judicial 
authorities</i>.—The penalties provided in the next preceding article shall be 
imposed upon the public officer or employee who shall detain any person for some 
legal ground and shall fail to deliver such person to the proper judicial 
authorities within the period of six hours." (As amended by Com. Act No. 
3940.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of prosecuting them under the above cited articles of the Revised 
Penal Code may appear to be hard, but we must not forget that "dura lex, sed 
lex" and whatever may be the consequences the law must be given its way.</p>
<p>We can imagine how the erring officials will feel at the prospective 
prosecution and how they might consider unbearable the idea of being sent to 
jail, but was it sweet or delicious for the twelve detainees to be illegally 
deprived of their freedom and confined in prison for so many days and nights, 
without any fault on their part at all? If respondents are zealous in keeping 
their own personal freedom, they cannot deny the victims of their recklessness 
the same legitimate desire.</p>
<p>Everybody can imagine the indescribable physical, mental, and moral 
sufferings endured by the twelve detainees and their respective families. The 
indignation felt by one who is the victim of an unjustifiable onslaught upon his 
individual dignity, the paralyzing anguish of the down-trodden who feels 
overwhelmed by brutal superior force against which his weakness cannot offer but 
the answer of futile despair, the excruciating thought of the alarm their 
absence will produce in their humble little homes, where their unprotected wives 
will try to drown their worries in bitter tears, while their little ones are 
trying to understand in infantile amazement the absence of their father and the 
tragedy entailed by that absence, are things that can hardly be attenuated by 
the thought that, after all, the Nippon <i>kempei</i> has already banished as an 
asphyxiating dream, and the unfortunate situation cannot be as bad as the 
sadistic and bestial horrors that the very mention of Fort Santiago conjure in 
our imagination, the mere memory of which produces thick sweat and blood 
congelation. There is no treasure in the world that can adequately compensate 
such sufferings. The only consolation that the situation may offer is the bereft 
hope that such sufferings may have the effect of awakening the conscience of our 
public officials so as to induce them to make the firm resolve to avoid the 
repetition of such abuses as the ones depicted in this case, that the guilty 
ones will earnestly repent of their misdeeds and will henceforth endeavor to 
accord the proper regard to the rights and liberties of their fellow human 
beings, thus contributing to diminish so many rampant manifestations of moral 
misorientation, including attempts to degrade the highest tribunal of the 
country, that now offend the good sense of the average citizen.</p>
<p>The provisions of law punishing arbitrary or illegal detention committed by 
government officers form part of our statute books even before the advent of 
American sovereignty in our country. Those provisions were already in effect 
during the Spanish regime; they remained in effect under American rule; 
continued in effect under the Commonwealth. Even under the Japanese regime they 
were not repealed. The same provisions continue in the statute books of the free 
and sovereign Republic of the Philippines. This notwithstanding, and the 
complaints often heard of violations of said provisions, it is very seldom that 
prosecutions under them have been instituted due to the fact that the erring 
individuals happened to belong to the same government to which the prosecuting 
officers belong. It is high time that every one must do his duty, without fear 
or favor, and that prosecuting officers should not answer with cold shrugging of 
the shoulders the complaints of the victims of arbitrary or illegal 
detention.</p>
<p>Only by an earnest enforcement of the provisions of articles 124 and 125 of 
the Revised Penal Code will it be possible to reduce to its minimum such wanton 
trampling of personal freedom as depicted in this case. The responsible 
officials should be prosecuted, without prejudice to the detainees' right to the 
indemnity to which they may be entitled for the unjustified violation of their 
fundamental rights.</p>
<p>The question of economic rehabilitation of our country is an everyday topic 
in the newspapers. We deem more important still the moral rehabilitation of our 
people; especially that of the officialdom. The Constitution requires (section 
5, Article 14) that "All schools shall aim to develop moral character, personal 
discipline, civic conscience, and vocational efficiency and to teach the duties 
of citizenship," and it will be highly desirable that this mandate should be 
borne in mind by all officers of the government, and that the qualities the 
Constitution ordains to be developed in all citizens should be, with more 
emphasis, required from officials and employees of the government, thus 
correcting the negative tropism shown in this case in regard to fundamental 
civil liberties.</p>
<p>The filing of information for insignificant misdemeanors against Pascual 
Montaniel and Pacifico Deoduco appears to us as a poor face-saving device to 
justify, in some way, their further detention, and should not be countenanced as 
a means to defeat the release of said two detainees.</p>
<p>In explaining in this concurring opinion, our position in voting in favor of 
the resolution of November 12, 1946, we wish to make it clear that we do not 
interpret article 125 of the Revised Penal Code as legalizing detentions not 
exceeding six hours. Said article does not legalize an illegal detention. It 
only offers a justifying circumstance which exempts the erring official from 
criminal prosecution, provided that the detention is made upon legal grounds and 
do not last more than six hours, but it will, and cannot, defeat a petition for 
a writ of habeas corpus in hehalf of a person illegally detained although the 
petition is filed before the termination of the six hours period mentioned in 
the article, as the constitutional guarantee of personal freedom is not subject 
to any time limit.</p>
<p>We wish to emphasize that it is highly dangerous to make of the fundamental 
rights of the citizens a kind of shuttlecock of passing moods or momentary whims 
of persons wielding some kind of government power. When the oestrous of official 
intolerance and braggadocio employed to cow into submission the twelve detainees 
has subsided, everybody will recognize in the cool and serene recesses of their 
conscience, that those who, under the pretext of subduing allegedly seditious 
persons; committed the arbitrariness complained of in the petition, trod a 
perilous path that, as shown by the experience of other countries, usually lead 
to the implantation of a dictatorship, whose whole philosophy is built upon the 
hateful slogan that everything, including the most cherished possessions and the 
most blessed ideals of the people, should be sacrificed for the sake of the 
state supremacy.</p>
<p>We are glad that two civic-minded groups of citizens, the Philippine Civil 
Liberties Union and the Philippine Lawyers Guild, have taken pains to appear in 
this Court in behalf of the twelve detainees, and we congratulate them for the 
success of their endeavors.</p>
<p>By actual personal experience and upon conclusive evidence, we know that it 
is not enough that the civil liberties and fundamental human rights be 
guaranteed in express constitutional provisions in order that they should 
effectively be protected. Eternal vigilance and constant willingness and 
readiness to fight for them are necessary.</p>
<p>When World War I was nearing its end, in the exercise of the freedom of the 
press, guaranteed by the Jones Law, as Editor of <i>La Nacion</i>, we made 
exposures of many unsatisfactory aspects of public affairs as they were then 
conducted. We made revelations regarding the scandals of the Philippine National 
Bank which caused many millions of losses to our Government. The powerful wanted 
us to be silenced. The Governor General, first through his Secretary, Mr. Irwin, 
and later through General Crame, Chief of the Philippine Constabulary, tried to 
intimidate us with drastic action by the Government if we should not stop the 
publication of the irregularities and illegalities we were denouncing then in 
the columns of our paper. They reminded us that the war justified any 
extraordinary measure by the Government, and that our denunciations, by tending 
to destroy public confidence in the authorities, were highly seditious. Our 
invariable answer to Mr. Irwin and General Crame was that the Governor General 
and they themselves were free to do what it would please them, but nothing shall 
deter us from doing what, according to our conscience, was our public duty. As 
we did not allow ourselves to be intimidated, a series of criminal prosecutions 
were instituted against us. Although the lower courts should invariably find us 
guilty, the Supreme Court had always acquitted us, by upholding the freedom of 
the press.</p>
<p>The existence of liberal elements, always watchful and ready to defend the 
victims of violations of the Bill of Rights, is necessary to vitalize democracy 
and to give tangible reality to the guarantees of the Constitution. The fight 
for personal freedom must go on, over and over again, as the forces of reaction 
are always ready to snatch any opportunity to set at naught the guarantees of 
the fundamental law, as happened in the bail incident in People <i>vs</i>. 
Jalandoni (G. R. No. L-777), and all liberal forces must always be ready to 
answer the summons of endangered liberties.</p>
<p>The attainment of great ideals needs faith, passionate adherence to them, the 
militant attitude manifested in the unflinching readiness to fight and face 
hardships and sacrifices, unconquerable steadfastness and unbreakable per 
severance in the face of obstacles and setbacks. These are the conditions and 
qualities with which thinkers and philosophers were able to discover the truth 
which have guided humanity as beacons in the path of progress; the founders of 
great religions, to transmit to millions their message of hope and the gospel of 
eternal moral principles: Columbus, to discover the New World, and Magellan to 
traverse the two largest oceans and encircle the globe; astronomers, to pierce 
the immensity of space to conquer new stars, parsees away; bacteriologists, to 
scavenge dangerous microorganisms; scientists, to fossick in the mysteries of 
matter to wrest new revelations which enhance the intellectual horizon of man 
and increase his means for enjoyment of life and happiness. The same conditions 
and qualities are among those needed by all liberal and progressive spirits to 
keep lighted the torch of liberty, to squelch the hydra of reaction, to conserve 
the moral heritage of advancement and conquests in the emporium of human rights 
bequeathed by the champions and martyrs who waged the heroic battles for real 
spiritual values and for the dignity of man as the image of God.</p>

<p align="center">RETURN OF WRIT</p>
<p>Come now the respondents in the above-entitled case, Valeriano E. Fugoso, 
Lamberto T. Javalera and John Doe, in their respective capacities as Mayor, 
Chief of Police and Officer in Charge of the Municipal Jail, all of the City of 
Manila, through their counsel, the undersigned City Fiscal, and in making their 
return to the petition filed herein, to this Honorable Court respectfully 
allege:</p>
<ol><li>That they admit the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 of said 
petition. 

<p></p></li><li>That they admit the fact, stated in paragraph 3 of said petition, regarding 
the arrest of the persons whose names are listed in paragraph 2 thereof, without 
warrant, by members of the Manila Police Department, and their detention until 
yesterday, November 11, 1946, at the Municipal Jail of the City of Manila; but 
they deny the rest of the allegations, especially that which states for a fact 
that said detained persons were arrested without lawful cause upon order of the 
respondent Valeriano E. Fugoso, as Mayor of the City of Manila, the truth of the 
matter being that the arrest was lawful, it having been made by members of the 
Manila Police Department duly appointed and qualified as such who acted in the 
performance of their official duties, and acting in the belief that the said 
detained persons, before or at the time of their arrest, were committing acts in 
violation of the laws of the land.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>That they admit the fact, alleged in paragraph 4 of said petition, that all 
the arrested persons have been placed under detention until yesterday, November 
11, 1946, at the Municipal Jail of the City of Manila; but they deny the rest of 
the allegations, specially that part which says that no charges have been filed 
against them notwithstanding the lapse of the period of six hours from the time 
of their arrest and commitment, the truth of the matter being that charges for 
inciting to sedition, disobedience to police orders and resisting arrest have 
been filed against them by the arresting police officers with the Office of the 
City Fiscal which has conducted the preliminary investigation of said cases in 
accordance with law.<p></p>

</li><li>That they deny the allegations contained in paragraph 5 of said petition, 
the same being merely conclusions of facts and/or of law. </li></ol>As special 
defenses, respondents hereby allege: 
<p>(<i>a</i>) That all of the twelve detained persons were arrested by police 
officers for acts which the arresting officers believed to constitute inciting 
to sedition, resisting arrest and disobedience to police orders, filing the 
corresponding cases against them with the Office of the City Fiscal immediately 
thereafter.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) That yesterday, November 11, 1946, before and after the receipt by 
them of their respective copies of the petition for habeas corpus herein filed, 
complaints had already been presented with the Municipal Court of Manila against 
Pascual Montaniel and Pacifico Deoduco not for inciting to sedition but for 
unjust vexation and for disobedience to police orders, respectively, the same 
being criminal cases Nos. <i>6765</i> and <i>7666</i> of the Municipal Court of 
Manila, copies of which complaints are being attached hereto and made a part 
hereof as Annexes 1 and 2.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) That likewise, before and after the receipt by them of their 
respective copies of the petition for habeas corpus, said respondents Valeriano 
E. Fugoso and Lamberto T. Javalera had already been notified of the dismissal by 
the Office of the City Fiscal of the cases for inciting to sedition against all 
the detained persons, for insufficiency of evidence, and of filing in the 
Municipal Court of Manila complaints against Pascual Montaniel and Pacifico 
Deoduco, as aforesaid.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) That, similarly, before and after his receipt of a copy of the 
petition for habeas corpusrthe respondent John Doe, in his capacity as Officer 
in ciiarge of the Municipal Jail, had received from the City Fiscal letters 
bearing date of November 11, 1946, copies of which are hereto attached as 
Annexes 3 and 4 of this Return, wherein he was advised that the cases against 
said detained persons for inciting to sedition have been dismissed for 
insufficiency of evidence, but that complaints were being filed against Pascual 
Montaniel and Pacifico Deoduco for unjust vexation and for disobedience to 
police orders, respectively, and wherein said respondent John Doe has been 
ordered by the City Fiscal to forthwith release all of said detained persons 
with the exception of Pascual Montaniel and Pacifico Diodoco, an order which has 
been complied with by said respondent John Doe as shown by the fact that said 
detained persons, with the exception of the latter two, had forthwith been 
released from custody.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) That Pascual Montaniel and Pacifico Deoduco continue to be 
detained and are being deprived of their liberty not without lawful cause, for 
the reason that there are at present pending against them criminal complaints 
with the Municipal Court of Manila for unjust vexation and disobedience to 
police orders as stated above.</p>
<p>Wherefore, respondents herein pray this Honorable Court to dismiss the 
petition, with costs against the petitioner.</p>

<p><strong>BRIONES, M.:</strong></p>
<p>El presente caso es un incidente de la famosa huelga declarada y efectuada en 
Noviembre del año pasado (1946) por obreros organizados de la ciudad de Manila 
en el servicio municipal de limpieza de calles y en obras publicas tambien 
municipales. Como fondo historico del caso en general, y de esta opinion en 
particular, cabe incluir en la narration de hechos el de que—como es 
acostumbrado en este genero de convulsiones sociales—despues de mucho 
apasionamiento por ambos lados, de no poca nerviosidad y de laboriosas 
negociaciones, la huelga que duro unas dos semanas quedo satisfactoriamente 
solucionada, aviniendose los huelguistas a volver a su trabajo a cambio de 
ciertas concesiones que hizo el Municipio de Manila, particularmente en la 
cuestion de bonificaciones y salarios. Sin embargo, resulta de autos y de la 
historia el dia reflejada principalmente en la prensa (de lo cual podemos 
naturalmente tomar conocimiento judicial) que la exaltation de los animos, la 
pasion ai rojo vivo produjeron algunos incidentes, unos dramaticos, otros 
comicos, llegando la tension nerviosa de algunos a exagerar tremendamente las 
proporciones del movimiento hasta el extremo de imaginarse rebeliones y 
sediciones alii donde no habia sino un espiritu algun tanto militante de parte 
de los obreros en la defensa de sus derechos e intereses y en la propaganda de 
su causa con la mira de ganarse la simpatia del publico. Uno de esos incidentes 
es la cogida o aprehension por la policia, sin previa orden de arresto, por el 
especioso pretexto de que estaban incitando y promoviendo nada menos que una 
sedicion contra el gobierno constituido, de doce obreros huelgistas, 
confinandoseles en la carcel por dicho motivo.</p>
<p>En nombre de esos doce se ha presentado esta solicitud de mandamiento de 
<i>habeas corpus</i> por Cecilio M. Lino, presidente de la Union de Empleados y 
Obreros de la Ciudad, filial del "Congress of Labor Organizations" (CLO), 
defendiendoles como abogados Emmanuel Pelaez, Francisco A. Rodrigo y Enrique M. 
Fernando, miembros y representantes de la sociedad civica "Philippine Civil 
Liberties Union," y Manuel M. Crudo, Claudio Teehankee y Jose" W. Diokno, 
miembros, y representantes del "Philippine Lawyers' Guild." En nombre de los 
recurridos ha comparecido ante esta Corte el Fiscal auxiliar Julio Villamor, de 
la ciudad de Manila.</p>
<p>Alegase en la solicitud que los doce obreros de que se trata fueron 
arrestadcs mientras estaban ejerciendo pacificamente sus derechos 
constitucionales, a saber: la libertad de la palabra y de la prensa, y el de 
reunion pacifica para pedir del gobierno el alvio de sus agravios. Se detallan 
especificamente los actos en que estaban ocupados cuando fueron arrestados, a 
saber:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Ricardo Suarez</i> (<i>Juarez</i>), <i>Gregorio Santiago, 
Ismael de Jesus y Serafin Pascual</i> fueron arrestados el 5 de Noviembre, 1946, 
en la calle de Pinkian, arrabal de Tondo, Manila, mientras estaban distribuyendo 
y pegando en las parades hojas volantes en que se explicaban las miserias y 
tribulaciones de los obreros en huelga y se apelaba a la simpatia y sentimientos 
humanitarios del publico para que apoyara la causa de los huelguistas.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Amando Racanday, Antonio Bulagada</i> (<i>Burlagada</i>) y 
<i>Mauro Fernandez</i> fueron arrestados el 6 de Noviembre, 1946, mientras 
estaban tranquilamente parados en la esquina de las calles de California y Gral. 
Luna, Paco, Manila, y sin ningun motivo aparente como no fuese el de que se 
habian adherido a la huelga y se hallaron en su posesion copias de las hojas 
volantes menciondas en el parrafo anterior.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Jose Badeo</i> y <i>Francisco Nevado</i> (<i>Levado</i>) fueron 
arrestados el 6 de Noviembre, 1946, mientras estaban tranquilamente parados en 
la esquina de las calles de Perez y California, Paco, Manila, y tambien sin 
ningiin motivo manifiesto como no fuese el de que se habian adherido igualmente 
a la huelga y tenian en su poder el aviso de una reunion que la organizacion 
obrera a que estaban afiliados iba a celebrar.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Pedro Martinez</i> fue arrestado el 8 de Noviembre, 1946, en la 
calle de Juan Luna, Gagalangin, Manila, y sin ninguna razon aparente excepto que 
el mismo se habia adherido a la huelga y andaba paseandose a lo largo de dicha 
calle con una banda llamativa que llevaba diagonalmente alrededor de su cuerpo y 
en la cual estaban escritas las siguientes palabras en tagalo: ¡DAMAYAN KAMI, 
HUAG MAG-ISKIROL! (<i>Help us! Don't be a scab!—Ayudadnos! ¡No seais 
desertores!</i>)</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>Pascual Montaniel</i> fue arrestado el 8 de Noviembre, 1946, en 
la calle de Cristobal, Paco, Manila, sin ningun motivo aparente como no fuese el 
de que habia saludado amistosamente a uno que no era huelguista.</p>
<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>Pacifico Deoduco</i> fue arrestado el 7 de Noviembre 1946, en 
la citada calle de Cristobal tambien sin razon manifiesta excepto que se habia 
adherido a la huelga.</p>
<p>Se puso de manifiesto en la audiencia, en los informes orales producidos por 
las partes, que los obreros arriba mencionados fueron recluidos en los calabozos 
desde que fueron arrestados hasta que, por recomendacion del Promotor Fiscal de 
la Ciudad, la Policia los puso en libertad, menos Montaniel y Deoduco, a las 
tres y media de la tarde del 11 Noviembre, por haberse hallado, segun la carta 
de dicho Fiscal al oficial de las prisiones de Manila, "que no hay prueba 
suficiente para justificar la prosecucion de dichos acusados ante los 
tribunales, apareciendo que las hojas volantes, manifiestos y otras hojas de 
propaganda que tales acusados distribuyeron entre el publico y exhibieron o 
fijaron en diferentes lugares dentro de la ciudad, no contenian ninguna frase o 
expresion de caracter sedicioso o de tal naturaleza que incitase la comision del 
delito de sedition" (Carta del Fiscal de la Ciudad de Manila, Jose P. Bengzon, 
de 11 de Noviembre de 1946, al oficial de las prisiones de la ciudad, anexo 3). 
Se ordeno, sin embargo, la continuation de la detention de Montaniel y Deoduco, 
a pesar de que tampoco habia pruebas de sedition contra ellos, porque la 
Fiscalia decidio a ultima hora presentar querellas, a saber: (<i>a</i>) contra 
Montaniel, por supuesta vejacion injusta, alegandose que el 8 de Noviembre, 
mientras Jesus Cambare guiaba y manejaba un "jeep" de la oficina del Ingeniero 
de la ciudad, Montaniel trato de pararle diciendole que dejase de guiar al 
servicio de la ciudad de Manila mientras durase la huelga, "con gran disgusto y 
molestia de dicho Jesus Cambare"; (<i>b</i>) contra Deoduco, por supuesta 
desobediencia a un policia, alegandose en la querella que el 7 de Noviembre, 
1946, el acusado entro sin permiso en el deposito de vehiculos de motor 
(<i>motor pool</i>) de la ciudad situado en la calle de Cristobal, Paco, y que 
cuando el policia de guardia, Vicente Celeridad, le intimido que saliera del 
lugar, dicho acusado persistio en quedarse desobedeciendo asi al policia.</p>
<p>Al llegar a este punto parece importante, y hasta necesario, fijar 
especificamente el tiempo en que tuvieron lugar ciertos acaecimientos y 
tramites. Esto nos servira para poner de relieve ciertos hechos capitales y 
ciertos puntos en contencion, y evaluarlos en toda su densidad. De autos e 
informes resultan los siguientes hechos: (<i>a</i>) que la presente solicitud de 
<i>habeas corpus</i> se presento y registro en la escribania de esta Corte el 11 
de Noviembre, 1946, a las 9 de la mañana poco mas o menos; (<i>b</i>) que el 
recurrido Alcalde Valeriano E. Fugoso fue emplazado de la solicitud en aquella 
misma mañana, a las 11:20; (<i>c</i>) que el recurrido jefe de policia Lamberto 
Javalera tambien fue emplazado de la solicitud en aquella misma mañana, a las 
11:30; (<i>d</i>) que el recurrido oficial de las prisiones de la ciudad John 
Doe fue asimismo emplazado en aquella mañana, a las 11:30; (<i>e</i>) que a la 
1:05 p. m. de aquel dia el Fiscal de la Ciudad envio su carta ya citada al 
oficial de las prisiones, dando instrucciones para que se pusiese inmediatamente 
en libertad a los detenidos, menos Montaniel y Deoduco; (<i>f</i>) que la 
policia recibio dichas instrucciones a las 2 de la tarde, y a las 3:30 p. m. las 
cumplimento soltando a los detenidos, excepto los ya mencionados Montaniel y 
Deoduco; (<i>g</i>) que, a pesar de que estos dos ultimos fueron arrestados el 8 
y 7 de Noviembre, respectivamente, la policia no envio a la Fiscalia los papeles 
acerca de sus casos sino en la tarde del 11 de Noviembre, es decir, del mismo 
dia en que se presento la solicitud de <i>habeas corpus</i>; (<i>h</i>) que la 
querella contra Montaniel, por vejacion injusta, se presento ante el juzgado 
municipal de Manila a las 2 de la tarde del 11 de Noviembre, es decir, algunas 
horas despues de presentada la solicitud de <i>habeas corpus</i>; (<i>i</i>) que 
la querella contra Deoduco, por desobediencia a un policia, se presento ante el 
juzgado municipal solamente en la mañana del 12 de Noviembre, o sea, al dia 
siguiente de interpuesto el recurso de <i>habeas corpus</i>.</p>
<p>Tambien resultan de los autos e informes los siguientes hechos: (1) que 
respecto de los diez detenidos que posteriormente fueron puestos en libertad por 
no haberse hallado ningun cargo fundado contra ellos, la Fiscalia admite haber 
recibido a tiempo de la policia los papeles correspondientes, es decir, dentro 
de 6 horas despues de verificados los arrestos, pero que si no pudo presentar 
ninguna querella durante un periodo de 7 dias—del 5 al 11 de Noviembre—o decidir 
que no habia ninguna sedicion como despues decidio, fue porque tenia otros 
muchos trabajos y porqne, ademas, necesitaba de tiempo para leer y desentrañar 
el significado de las hojas volantes y manifiestos, y ver si en ellos habia 
alguna manifestation sediciosa o criminal; (2) la Fiscalia admite que las hojas 
volantes y manifiestos no eran voluminosos sino que se componia de unas cuantas 
hojas y que normalmente no se necesitaban dias ni siquiera horas para leerlos y 
determinar su signification y sentido, pues no estaban concebidos y escritos en 
jeroglificos, sino en un tagalo sencillo, llano y popular, como es usual en 
papeles de propaganda; (3) que durante la detencion de los arrestados se trato 
de gestionar y obtener su libertad provisional y la Fiscalia señalo a dicho 
efecto la prestacion de una fianza de Pl2,000 para cada uno, basando la Fiscalia 
su requerimiento en la gravedad del delito supuestamente cometido—el de 
sedicion; (4) que asi continuaron las cosas hasta que se presento ante esta 
Corte la solicitud de <i>habeas corpus</i> en la mañana del dia 11, viniendo 
luego la rapida sucesion de acontecimientos de que ya se ha hecho merito.</p>
<p>Habiendo sido puestos en libertad diez de los doce detenidos antes de que se 
viera la presente solicitud de <i>habeas corpus</i> ¿es todavia pertinente que 
examinemos la totalidad de los hechos, incluso los relativos a los ya liberados? 
Creemos que si; la cuestion, a nuestro juicio, no ha venido a ser meramente 
academica, por las siguientes razones: <i>primera</i>, porque ya esta Corte 
habia asumido jurisdiccion sobre el caso mediante la presentacion de la 
solicitud de <i>habeas corpus</i> cuando los diez detenidos fueron soltados—de 
hecho, cabe afirmar que la interposicion de este recurso fue cl motivo de que se 
les soltase, pues no podia ser simple coincidencia casual el que, al cabo de 
varios dias de extraña inaccion, se diese como de prisa y corriendo la orden de 
libertad provisional unas cuantas horas despues de registrada en la escribania 
de esta Corte al solicitud de <i>habeas corpus</i>; <i>segunda</i>, porque si 
bien es cierto que Montaniel y Deoduco, los dos que no han sido soltados, fueron 
arrestados independientemente de los otros y en diferentes fechas, sus casos, 
sin embargo, son perfectamente identicos a los de los otros, pudiendo decirse 
que la policia arrestd y detuvo a todos ellos como partes de una conspiracion y 
sedicion organizada; asi que para lograr una adecuada perspectiva no hay mas 
remedio que enfocar conjuntamente los casos, o hay que decirlo mas bien en 
singular—el caso de los doce; y <i>tercera</i>, porque si bien es verdad que en 
los procedimientos de <i>habeas corpus</i> la cuestion principal es la 
liberacion fisica de la persona que esta privada de libertad y que cuando se ha 
obtenido tal resultado parece que los procedimientos deben darse por terminados 
y, por lo general, huelga todo comentario o exposicion de criterio sobre los 
hechos y la ley o doctrina juridica aplicable o deducible de los mismos, es 
evidente, sin embargo, que se dan casos en que los hechos son de tal 
transcendencia en relation con la vida de las instituciones, con la existencia 
del Estado, con las libertades publicas, con el orden social, o con la 
existencia de la misma comunidad civil y politica, que no porque deliberada o 
indeliberadamente se logra hurtarlos a la accion y decision de los tribunales, 
estos quedan excusados de exponer su criterio o hacer algun pronunciamiento, 
maxime si como en nuestro caso, en el caso de esta Corte Suprema, el 
pronunciamiento judicial, la exposicion de criterio puede no ser una cosa 
meramente teorica y academica, sino que puede irradiar un activo y eficaz 
influjo de saludable ejemplaridad y repercusion en la vida juridica sentando 
normas inequivocas de politica y conducta publica, o bien condenando y 
corrigiendo desmanes y abusos si abusos y desmanes se han cometido; y no cabe 
duda de que el que tenemos ante Nos es uno de esos casos. Este es un caso en que 
no hay mas remedio que hablar claro y fuerte para que lo oigan hasta los sordos, 
si se quiere que esta republica pise terreno firme y seguro en su lento caminar 
hacia el cumplimiento de sus destinos humanos e historicos; si se quiere que 
entre nosotros la constitucion, la ley, el orden, la libertad y la democracia no 
sean un mito, juguete de tiranuelos y despotillas, sino realidades vivientes y 
cotidianas; si se quiere, en una palabra, que este colosal experimento en que 
estamos empeñados—experimento de democracia politico-economico-social-cristiana 
en el gran pielago de la Oceania—resulte un acabado exito y una obra que podamos 
legar con orgullo a nuestros descendientes.</p>
<p>Lo primero que salta a la vista es que los doce obreros de que se trata no 
estaban cometiendo ningun delito, mucho menos el de sedicion, cuando sin previa 
orden judicial de arresto fueron aprehendidos como si hubiesen sido cogidos 
<i>in fraganti</i> en el preciso momento de perpetrar un crimen, de esos que dan 
lugar a procedimientos de oficio y captura y detencion inmediatas por cualquier 
agente de seguridad publica. Es verdad que eran huelguistas, pero ¿es acaso la 
huelga un crimen? Es verdad tambien que algunos de ellos fueron cogidos 
repartiendo y distribuyendo en las calles ciertas hojas volantes y pegando en 
muros y paredes ciertos manifestos, pero ¿eran criminosos, incendiarios o 
subversivos estos papeles? Tampoco: la Fiscalia de la ciudad, despues de 
examinarlos por varios dias—¡paciente y minucioso examen!—acabo por dictaminar a 
ultima hora que se trataba de literatura inocente, esto es, que no contenia 
ninguna manifestacion sediciosa, recomendando en consecuencia que diez de los 
doce fuesen inmediatamente soltados despues de una detencion no solo 
absolutamente injustificada, sino ademas ilegal porque excedio con mucho las 6 
horas que fija el codigo penal como tiempo maximo de detencion en los casos en 
que no hay previa orden judicial de arresto y no se entrega al detenido a la 
autoridad judicial correspondiente dentro de dichas 6 horas.</p>
<p>Es cierto asimismo que algunos de los mencionados obreros fueron cogidos por 
la policia mientras estaban pacificamente parados en una esquina formando 
pequeños grupos, hallandose a lo mas en su poder copia del aviso para un mitin 
de la organizacion obrera a que estaban afiliados; pero ¿de cuando aca ha sido 
un crimen el estar pacificamente levantados en una esquina, siquiera fuese en 
pequeños grupos, y el tener en el bolsillo la copia de una convocatoria para un 
mitin pacifico? Esto jamas habia sido un crimen ni en los dias mas obscuros de 
nuestra sujecion a la soberania americana; menos ha de serlo ahora en que somos 
una nacion independiente, constituimos una republica, y estamos cobijados bajo 
la sombra de nuestra propia bandera, teñida en grana de la sangre de tantos y 
tantos martires de la libertad que no, ¡no es posible hayan muerto en vano!</p>
<p>Es cierto igualmente que a uno de dichos obreros se le cogio porque andando 
por las calles tenia arrollada al cuerpo—¡notable experto en el arte de la 
propaganda!—Una banda en que se leian siguientes palabras en tagalo: "¡Damayan 
kami, huwag mag-eskirol!" (Help us, don't be a scab! ¡Ayudadnos, no seais 
desertores!); parece que la policia hallo esto como algo subversivo, como una 
incitacion a cometer sedicion. Resulta patente, sin embargo, que el gesto de 
este obrero propagandista no podia ser mas subversivo ni mas incendiario que el 
de Diogenes, el cinico, aquel que, metido en una barrica y portando una 
linterna, rodaba por las calles de Atenas en pleno dia buscando un 
<i>hombre</i>. Que sepamos, a ningun policia ateniense se le ocurrio coger a 
Diogenes por atentar contra la seguridad de la republica. * * *</p>
<p>Ahora llegamos al caso de Montaniel y Deoduco: el primero fue cogido porque 
trato de parar a un chofer de la ciudad mientras guiaba un "jeep" y le invito a 
que se sumase a la huelga; y el segundo porque entro sin permiso en un deposito 
de vehiculos de motor de la ciudad y no quiso salir de alli desobedeciendo las 
ordenes del policia de guardia. La policia creia que estos actos eran 
sediciosos, y arresto y detuvo a Montaniel y Deoduco por varios dias. Sin 
embargo, la Fiscalia, al igual que en los otros casos, dictamino que tampoco 
habia aqui sedicion, pero recomendo la continuacion de la detencion 
querellandoles por faltas que ni siquiera dan lugar a obligado arresto, segun el 
codigo penal: contra Montaniel, por supuesta vejacion injusta; y contra Deoduco, 
por supuesta desobediencia ligera a unas ordenes policiacas. ¿Verdad que esto 
hace recordar el laborioso parto de los montes? Un raton despues de tanto 
estruendo, tanta batahola. * * * Pero tambien hace recordar algo mas: la hoja de 
parra biblica para cubrir embarazos y verguenzas de ultima hora. * * * Algunos 
podran incluso decir que para el buen nombre y prestigio de la autoridad acaso 
hubiera sido mejor reconocer el error paladinamente, con gallarda hombradia, 
soltando a todos los detenidos sin excepciones forzadas y especiosas. Hay hasta 
grandeza y respetabilidad en la valiente admision de las propias faltas, yerros 
y limitaciones.</p>
<p>Se ha querido atenuar la gravedad de la accion policiaca tomando por sedicion 
Io que no era mas que llano ejercicio de derechos elementales de ciudadania, con 
la excusa de la ignorancia, alegandose que los aprehensores eran simples 
patrulleros o reclutas, por lo que no cabia esperar de ellos que discerniesen 
bien entre el delito de sedicion y un acto puramente inocente o una mera falta. 
Pero ¿es posible tal cuantia de ignorancia en el personal policiaco de este 
pais? ¿No se celebran acaso examenes de servicio civil para la calificacion de 
dicho personal, fijandose ciertas reglas, normas y requisitos de estudios 
escolares para poder ser admitidos en tales examenes? Pero suponiendo ya—lo que 
es mucho suponer—que cupiera invocar la ignorancia o falta de instruccion a 
favor del policia, patrullero o recluta de una aldea, de un villorrio ¿es 
posible, es siquiera medianamente decoroso que eso se invoque a favor del 
policia metropolitan de la ciudad de Manila, la capital de la republica? Ademas, 
tratandose de una huelga obrera de tales proporciones como la que motivo los 
arrestos que nos ocupan—suceso dramatico, sensacional que agito y conmovio a 
todo el vecindario de la ciudad de Manila por afectar a ciertos servicios 
municipales indispensables—¿como se puede concebir que los patrulleros y 
reclutas del cuerpo de policia salieran a la calle para cumplir sus deberes en 
la custodia y mantenimiento del orden publico sin un plan previamente concert 
ado y preparado por sus jefes y superiores, y sobre todo, sin recibir antes de 
estos las necesarias instrucciones sobre como iban a cumplir tales deberes, 
sobre que actos debian considerarse delictivos o sediciosos, sobre que actos y 
manifestaciones podian permitirse y tolerarse, etc., etc.? Es mas: suponiendo ya 
que los aprehensores, en la precipitacion o en el calor del momento, se 
equivocaran o se excedieran abusando de sus poderes, haciendo lo que hicieron, 
esto es, arrestando sin motivo justificado a los doce huelguistas de que se 
trata ¿no tenia, no tiene la policia de Manila un cuerpo o una division legal, 
compuesta de abogados, trabajando tranquilamente en sus mesas, entre las cuatro 
paredes de una oficina, rodeados de libros, sin prisas, sin excitaciones, 
depurando los hechos de cada caso, de cada arresto, examinando su fase legal, 
compulsando y analizando papeles y documentos, evaluando precedentes locales y 
extranjeros, etc., etc.? Y ¿no tenia la policia de Manila, con toda su division 
legal, el periodo de 6 horas que señala la ley para todo ese trabajo de 
investigacion, de examen, de analisis de los hechos y de la ley, para ver si se 
habia cometido o no un crimen, si se habia perpetrado o no el delito grave de 
sedicion? Si hubiera habido el debido respeto, la debida consideracion a la 
libertad, a los derechos constitucionales del individuo—derechos sagrados, 
inviolables, aunque ese individuo fuese un simple obrero, un humilde recogedor 
de cubetas municipales—¿por que la policia de Manila, con toda su bateria de 
abogados, comenzando por el Jefe hasta el ultimo oficial, no habia de exprimir 
ese periodo legal de 6 horas, sacar de el todo el partido posible para estudiar 
y depurar los arrestos y ver que no estaban justificados a la luz de la ley de 
sedicion—conclusion a que despues se llego, pero varios dias despues de tener 
pisoteada la libertad en los calabozos municipales, en contravencion de la 
ley?</p>
<p>Los abusos, arbitrariedades, extralimitaciones y excesos autoritarios por 
parte de la policia o de cualquier agente de seguridad y orden publico son una 
cosa que jamas debe ser tomada ligeramente, frivolamente, con la indiferencia y 
despreocupaeion con que muchas veces se toman ciertas cosas que se estiman 
inevitables o rutinarias—"matter of course," como se dice en ingles—si se quiere 
que la causa de la democracia y libertad no sufra entre nosotros un quebranto 
que puede ser fatal para la existencia misma de la republica. La historia y la 
experiencia nos demuestran de consuno que la indiferencia, la dejadez de los 
pueblos es la que siempre ha echado a perder la libertad en el mundo. Es harto 
significativo que en nuestra misma epoca los gobiernos totalitarios, de sangre y 
de fuerza, hayan todos tenido que afianzarse en la policia para consolidar su 
poder por los cuatro costados y asegurar la castracion, mejor todavia, la 
estrangulacion de la voluntad popular, el abatimiento de toda resistencia 
ciudadana: el nazismo, en Hitler y su <i>gestapo</i>; el fascismo, en los 
rufianes de camisa negra de Mussolini; el despotismo nipon, en su famoso 
<i>kempetai</i>; y el absolutismo comunista, en la <i>ogpu</i>. Y el proceso de 
disolucion ha comenzado siempre por la inercia, la abulia de las masas. Pocas 
frases historicas tienen la perenne significacion vital de esta: "La vigilancia 
es el eterno precio de la libertad." O de estas otras de nuestro gran Dr. Rizal: 
"La resignacion no siempre es virtud; es crimen cuando alienta tiranias"—"No hay 
tiranos donde no hay esclavos." O de esta otra: "Cada pueblo tiene el gobierno 
que se merece."</p>
<p>(Asi que, entre parentesis, merecen placemes las sociedades de caracter 
civico y profesional y algunos de sus miembros que romanticamente, 
desinteresadamente, han comparecido en el presente caso para romper lanzas por 
la causa de la libertad. Ellos pertenecen a una orden benemerita que puede 
propiamente llamarse la Orden de los Vigilantes de la Libertad.)</p>
<p>Se arguye en favor de los recurridos que la policia entrego a la Fiscalia de 
Manila los papeles correspondientes dentro de las 6 horas que fija el articulo 
125 del Codigo Penal Revisado y que, por tanto, la demora ilegal, si la hubo, no 
tuvo lugar en los cuarteles de la policia sino en la oficina del Fiscal. Aunque 
ello no se trasluce clara e inequivocamente en autos, parece que se puede 
admitir que respecto de los 10 que han sido puestos en libertad los papeles se 
entregaron a la Fiscalia oportunamente; no asi respecto. de Montaniel y Deoduco, 
los dos cuya detencion se ha prolongado. Resulta de autos y de los informes 
producidos' en la audiencia que Deoduco fue arrestado el 7 de Noviembre y 
Montaniel el 8; que los papeles en ambos casos se entregaron por la policia a la 
Fiscalia en la tarde del 11 de Noviembre, 4 y 3 dias respectivamente despues del 
arresto, es decir, <i>mucho despues de las 6 horas fijadas por la ley</i>; que 
la querella contra Montaniel se presento, como queda dicho mas arriba, en la 
misma tarde del dia 11, y la querella contra Deoduco, por desobediencia, ya en 
la mañana del 12, esto es, en el mismo dia de la vista de la presente solicitud 
de <i>habeas corpus</i>.</p>
<p>La Fiscalia explica la demora diciendo que por aquellos dias estaba 
sobrecargada de trabajos; que, ademas de los 12 obreros detenidos de que se 
trata, habia otros muchos por diferentes delitos y faltas; que necesitaba de 
tiempo para examinar bien las hojas volantes y demas papeles; que tambien 
necesitaba de tiempo para atar bien los cabos y las circunstancias a fin de ver 
si con la huelga estaba relacionado un movimiento coordinado de sedicion, y si 
los actos de los 12 arrestados formaban parte de ese movimiento. La Fiscalia 
admite haber fijado en la cantidad prohibitiva de P12,000 la fianza que debia 
prestar cada detenido para su libertad provisional mientras se estudiaban los 
casos. Mas tarde, cuando la Fiscalia se convencio de que no habia sedicion ni 
nada que se le pareciera, recomendo una fianza de P100 para Montaniel y de P200 
para Deoduco.</p>
<p>Sin discutir la responsabilidad de la Fiscalia por la demora—si esta se puede 
o no justificar administrativamente es cuestion que no nos compete considerar ni 
resolver—vamos a limitarnos a comentar y discutir la fase juridica, legal. Esta 
en orden naturalmente el hacer la siguiente pregunta: ¿es correcta, es acertada 
la asercion de que el "Promotor Fiscal de Manila es un funcionario judicial 
(judicial officer)," y que, por tanto, la entrega al mismo de la persona de un 
detenido dentro del periodo de 6 horas equivale a la entrega a las autoridades 
judiciales correspondientes (proper judicial authorities) de que habla el 
articulo 125 del Codigo Penal Revisado? Creemos que no: ni por su letra ni por 
su espiritu puede aplicarse por extension la fraseologia de ese articulo al 
Fiscal de la ciudad de Manila o a cualquier otro Fiscal; ese articulo no puede 
referirse mas que a un tribunal, a un juzgado, sea municipal, sea de primera 
instancia. Asi que estoy de perfecto acuerdo con la ponencia cuando 
positivamente sienta la doctrina de que "si bien un arresto puede hacerse sin 
orden cuando hay motivos razonables para ello (regla 109, articulo 6, Reglamento 
de los Tribunales), el detenido no puede ser recluido fuera del periodo 
prescrito por la ley, a menos que una orden de arresto se obtenga antes de un 
tribunal competente" (veanse las autoridades que se citan), y que "en el 
presente caso el Fiscal de la ciudad no tenia autoridad para expedir ordenes de 
arresto y carecia de facultad para convalidar tal detencion ilegal con solo 
presentar las querellas, o con una orden de su propia cuenta, ora tacita, ora 
expresa" (veanse asimismo las autoridades que se citan).</p>
<p>De lo dicho se sigue que cuando la policfa entrega a la Fiscalia de la ciudad 
despues del periodo de 6 horas prescrito por la ley los papeles sobre un 
detenido arrestado sin previa orden al efecto, no por ello se cura la ilegalidad 
del arresto y detencion, sino que dicha ilegalidad continua y persiste hasta que 
el Fiscal presenta la qnerella y obtiene una orden de arresto del tribunal 
competente, o que, tratandose de delito, mediante la prestacion de una fianza 
cuya cuantia se fijare y recomendare por dicho Fiscal, la policfa soltare al 
detenido, a tenor de lo previsto en el articulo 2460 del codigo 
administrativo.</p>
<p>Puede ocurrir, sin embargo, que la policia entregue los papeles a la Fiscalia 
de la ciudad dentro del periodo de 6 horas, pero que la Fiscalia no solo deja 
pasar dicho periodo, sino que transcurren dias, hasta semanas sin actuar sobre 
el caso en uno u otro sentido. La cuestion en orden naturalmente es la 
siguiente: ¿es legal o ilegal la detencion del arrestado en tal caso? En otras 
palabras: ¿queda suspendido el periodo de 6 horas durante el tiempo que el 
Fiscal de la ciudad tarda en actuar sobre el caso? La contestation tiene que ser 
necesariamente negativa. La rigidez, la inflexibilidad del periodo de 6 horas 
reza no solo para la policia, sino hasta para cualquier otra agencia o ramo 
oficial, sin excluir a la Fiscalia de la ciudad de Manila. Si por cualquier 
motivo la Fiscalia dejare de actuar dentro de dicho periodo, el deber de la 
policia o del que tenga la custodia del detenido es soltarle, quiera o no quiera 
el Fiscal, lo recomiende o no lo recomiende. De otra manera, la restriccion que 
estatuye la ley a favor de los detenidos sin previa orden de arresto—restriccion 
que implementa las garantias de la libertad establecidas en la 
Constitucion—resultaria un mito. La filosofia de la ley es, a saber: solamente 
se verifica un arresto sin previa orden cuando hay motivos razonables para ello, 
<i>v. gr.</i>, cuando un individuo es cogido <i>in fraganti</i> cometiendo un 
delito. La ley presupone, por tanto, que el Estado tiene a mano todos los 
elementos necesarios para decidir que accion ha de tomar dentro del periodo de 6 
horas, ya entregando la persona del detenido a las autoridades judiciales 
correspondientes mediante la querella procedente, a tenor del articulo 125 del 
codigo penal revisado; ya poniendole en libertad provisional bajo una fianza 
razonable, de acuerdo con el citado articulo 2460 del codigo administrativo; o 
ya poniendole completamente en la calle por falta de meritos en el caso. Si 
ninguna de estas cosas puede hacer el Estado en 6 horas no puede ser mas que por 
dos motivos: o porque se quiere cometer una arbitrariedad, o la maquinaria 
oficial se halla en un deplorable estado de confusion, ineptitud o 
impotencia.</p>
<p>Se arguye con enfasis que bajo esta interpretacion la prosecucion del crimen 
sufriria un serio quebranto, sobre todo en la ciudad de Manila; que 
materialmente la Fiscalia no puede actuar adecuadamente sobre algunos casos en 
el plazo perentorio de 6 horas. Si esto es verdad el remedio no es infringir la 
ley como cosa inevitable, rutinaria; el remedio seria—o recabar de la 
Legislatura que se reforme la ley en la forma que se estime conveniente, o 
implementar y perfeccionar la maquinaria de la prosecucion criminal colocandola 
a la altura de las circunstancias. No hay nada mas anarquico, mas subversivo y 
fatal para el principio de la autoridad del buen gobierno que el tener leyes que 
no se cumplen, leyes que se infringen hasta por los llamados a ponerlas en 
vigor. "To be or not to be, that is the question." O existe la ley y hay que 
cumplirla; o si la ley es mala o impracticable, hay que reformarla o derogarla. 
Lo que no se debe permitir es el disolvente espectaculo de la diaria 
inobservancia de la ley.</p>Tenemos un precedente recientisimo: la ley sobre el 
Tribunal del Pueblo (Ley del Commonwealth No. 682, articulo 19). Una de las 
disposiciones mas importantes de esa ley es precisamente la que reforma el 
articulo 125 del codigb penal revisado, extendiendo el periodo de 6 horas a 6 
meses a fin de legalizar la detencion de los que, sospechosos de traicion, 
fueron arrestados y detenidos por las autoridades del ejercito americano 
inmediatamente despues de la liberation de Filipinas de la conquista japonesa. 
De paso se puede precisamente decir que esa reforma es uno de los mejores 
argumentos contra la tesis de que durante el tiempo en que la Fiscalia de la 
ciudad estudia el caso el periodo de 6 horas queda en suspenso y se legaliza la 
detencion. Si esto fuese correcto, no hubiera habido necesidad de insertar esa 
disposicion reformatoria en la ley sobre el Tribunal del Pueblo.<br><br><br>

<p>The writ should have been denied or dismissed as to all the persons on whose 
behalf the petition was filed, including Pascual Montaniel and Pacifico 
Deoduco.</p>
<p>According to the return the last two had been arrested by the police for 
inciting to sedition on the occasion of the strike of the City of Manila workers 
and had been duly charged after their arrest with unjust vexation and 
disobedience to public orders, respectively. The complaints had been filed by 
the City Fiscal with the municipal court, and the Fiscal had recommended a bail 
of P100 for Montaniel and P200 for Deoduco for their temporary release. The 
fiscal in his return further stated that these complaints had been docketed on 
"November 11, 1946, before and after the receipt by them (respondents) of their 
respective copies of the petition for habeas corpus herein filed." The last 
allegation contradicts the finding in the decision of the majority that "the 
complaints were filed on the same day when this case was heard before this 
Court, that is, on November 12, 1946."</p>
<p>The allegations in the return are presumed to be correct, the same not having 
been controverted. The return to the writ, of itself, is not conclusive of the 
facts alleged therein, but is <i>prima facie</i> proof of such facts. In the 
absence of a denial, or appropriate pleading avoiding their effect, they will be 
taken as true and conclusive, regardless of the allegations contained in the 
petition, and the only question for determination is whether or not the facts 
stated in their return, as a matter of law, authorizes the restraint under 
investigation. (39 C. J. S., 664, 665.)</p>
<p>Here Pascual Montaniel or Pacifico Diaduco entitled to be discharged upon the 
facts set forth in the return? The decision of the majority says yes. It reasons 
that "Even assuming that they (the prisoners) were legally arrested without 
warrant on November 7 and 8, 1946, respectively, their continued detention 
became illegal upon the expiration of six hours without their having been 
delivered to the corresponding judicial authorities. (Article 125, Rev. Pen. 
Code, as amended by Act No. 3940.) Their cases were referred to the City Fiscal 
late in the afternoon of November 11, 1946, that is four and three days, 
respectively, after they were arrested. The illegality of their detention was 
not cured by the filing of the informations against them, since no warrants of 
arrest or orders of commitment have been issued by the municipal court up to the 
hearing of this case before this Court." The decision goes on to say that "the 
City Fiscal, who has no authority to issue warrants of arrest (Hashim <i>vs</i>. 
Boncan and City Fiscal of Manila, 71 Phil., 261) was powerless to validate such 
illegal detention by merely filing informations or by any order of his own, 
either express or implied."</p>
<p>With all modesty and with due respect to the opinion of the majority, I take 
a different view. The bringing of the prisoners before the City Fiscal made a 
whole lot of difference and totally changed the legal aspects of the detention. 
The Prosecuting Attorney of the City of Manila 13 a judicial officer with powers 
to make investigations on the same level as a municipal judge or justice of the 
peace. (United States <i>vs</i>. Rubal, 37 Phil., 577; section 2, Rule 108, of 
the Rules of Court.) Section 2, Rule 108 provides that "every justice of the 
peace, municipal judge or city fiscal shall have jurisdiction to conduct 
preliminary investigation of all offenses alleged to have been committed within 
his municipality or city, cognizable by the Court of First Instance." And with 
particular reference to the Fiscal of the City of Manila, section 2465 of the 
Revised Administrative Code ordains that he "shall cause to be investigated all 
charges of crimes, misdemeanors, and violations of ordinances, and have the 
necessary informations or complaints prepared or made against the persons 
accused."</p>
<p>I conclude from these provisions that when Montaniel's and Diaduco's cases 
were reported to the City Fiscal, that action put an end to the illegality of 
their detention, assuming that the prolonged detention had been unwarranted. In 
other words, if Montaniel's and Diaduco's detention had become illegal upon the 
expiration of six hours from the time of their arrest, it reacquired its lawful 
character the moment they were taken to the City Fiscal for appropriate action 
on their cases; in fact the prisoners could not thereafter be released by the 
police except in the manner provided by law. What the law is, I shall endeavor 
to explain.</p>
<p>There is legal and rational support for the proposition that after the case 
of an arrested person has been placed in the hands of a fiscal or municipal 
judge, il is the right, let alone the duty, of the police to keep him in custody 
until he is discharged according to law regardless of the illegality of his 
previous detention, which, by the way, is not to be confused with the arrest. 
This practice is made necessary, at least in the City of Manila, by the very 
nature of things as well as by express enactments. The law, statutory and 
common, is that an officer or private individual who has made an arrest of a 
person without a warrant has authority to detain him in custody until a 
preliminary hearing against him can be had (4 Am. Jur., 49) and he may then be 
committed to jail or held to bail (William F. Downs <i>vs</i>. Sherlock Swann, 
23 L. R. A., N. S., 739, citing Brish <i>vs</i>. Carter, 98 Md., 445, and Edger 
<i>vs</i>. Burke, 96 Md., 722). Supplementing and confirming this general rule 
the Manila Charter specifically vests on the Chief of Police the power to keep 
the prisoner in custody or release him on bail, although in cases of violation 
of any penal law, as distinguished from violations of municipal ordinances, the 
bail is fixed by the City Fiscal and the release must be authorized or 
recommended by the latter. Section 2460 of the Revised Administrative Code thus 
states that "the chief of police may take good and sufficient bail for the 
appearance before the city court of any person arrested for violation of any 
city ordinances: <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>, That he shall not exercise 
this power in case of violations of any penal law, except when the fiscal of the 
city shall so recommend and fix the bail to be required of the person 
arrested."</p>
<p>In consonance with the foregoing rule and provision, the practice followed by 
the City Fiscal of Manila, when a person arrested without a warrant is brought 
before him, has been either to fix the bond and order the provisional release of 
the prisoner before filing a complaint or information or making an 
investigation, or else to file a complaint or information and leave it to the 
appropriate court to admit the detained person to bail. In neither case it is 
necessary to, nor does the court, as a matter of fact, issue an order of arrest. 
This is so simply because the accused is already under arrest; and the court 
does not issue a commitment because there is no final judgment and because the 
arrest has not been effected by its order. It is to be remembered that the City 
Fiscal himself has no authority to order, but only to recommend to the police, 
the release of detained persons. Neither is the City Fiscal empowered to order 
the continued detention of such persons for the reason already stated, that it 
is upon the authority and responsibilty of the Chief of Police that this 
functionary holds the prisoners until the court commands his discharge.</p>
<p>The previous illegality of the detention of Montaniel and Deoduco has no 
relevancy to their petition for habeas corpus and it is a mistake for this Court 
to allow itself to be influenced thereby. There can be no serious doubt as to 
the intent of article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3940, 
which says that "The penalties provided in the next preceding article shall be 
imposed upon the public officer or employee who shall detain any person for some 
legal ground and shall fail to deliver such person to the proper judicial 
authorities within the period of six hours." This provision refers solely to 
detention by a police officer prior to the retained person'a delivery to the 
proper judicial officer. It does not restrict the time within which the fiscal 
of the city, a justice of the peace or a municipal judge should act on the case. 
It seeks to prevent abuses by the police—to prevent them from keeping for an 
unreasonable length of time arrested persons who are not properly charged before 
a competent judicial officer, or whose detention has no justifiable cause. It 
does not force the city fiscal, justice of the peace or municipal judge to 
release the prisoners at or before the expiration of six hours from the time of 
their arrest. Nothing could have been farther from the thought of the 
legislature than to tie so tightly the hands of the law, and coddle and pamper 
lawlessness to a calamitous extreme. It requires no mental effort to see that it 
is beyond the ability of any person to make an investigation of a criminal case, 
file a complaint or information, and secure an arrest warrant or commitment in 
six hours, or worse still what remains, if any, of that period computed from the 
time of the arrest. The theory sustained by the majority, if put into practice, 
would play havoc on the efforts of law-enforcement agencies and the 
administration of criminal law, certain to produce disastrous consequences, not 
difficult to imagine, in the maintenance of peace and order. The decision of 
this Court sets a precedent which will open the door to evasions of criminal 
prosecution. The populous conditions of Manila and other centers of population 
in the Philippines as they exist today, and the modern facilities of 
transportation and rapid transit afford easy means for avoiding re-arrest or 
fleeing from justice. Such evasions and such escapes would be the result of the 
holding that a person who has been arrested without a warrant and detained 
beyond the six-hour limit by the police should be discharged irrespective of the 
filing of a complaint after the lapse of that period, on the pendency of an 
appropriate criminal action against him. The situation which I have pictured 
will follow from the ruling that even if a crime has been committed by the 
person arrested and a complaint has been filed against him, he nevertheless 
should be released, without prejudice to his re-arrest on a formal information 
or complaint lodged against him.</p>
<p>I do not justify or condemn the arrest or the detention beyond the six-hour 
limit of the petitioners. This question is not in issue and must be judged in 
the light of the surrounding circumstances of the case which are not before us. 
But I do maintain that the illegal detention, if there was illegal detention, 
and the subsequent lawful restraint are separable and must not be confounded 
with each other. If a crime was committed as a result of the prolonged detention 
of the prisoners, there is the penal law and the proper machinery of justice to 
take care of the erring officials. To prosecution and punishment or correction 
of criminal offenders is a vital concern of the State, vital to its very 
existence. The interests of the people should not be sacrificed or jeopardized 
by the ignorance, negligence or malicious conduct of the police.</p>
<p>The opinion of the majority stems from the erroneous assumption that the 
right to the writ must be determined according to the facts as they appear at 
the time of the filing of the petition. <i>Some early cases</i> did hold that 
valid process obtained after the time of service of the writ of habeas corpus 
was not sufficient, and that a person detained unlawfully must be discharged 
from the imprisonment under the unlawful proceedings, although he might 
thereafter be detained on lawful proceedings. But the better, present-day and 
preponderant rule, which is more in keeping with modern conditions and better 
safeguards against modern facilities for escape, is that a prisoner has no right 
to a writ of habeas corpus unless he is entitled to immediate release, and the 
writ will not issue unless he is presently in restraint of his liberty without 
warrant of law; that the writ of habeas corpus is concerned solely with the 
legality of the restraint at the time of the filing of the petition for its 
issue, or by the conditions existing at the time of the hearing or final 
decision thereon, and does not depend on the legality or illegality of the 
original caption; and that where the detention is lawful at the time of the 
return, it is sufficient to defeat the writ. (39 C. J. S., 443, 444.) The United 
States Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Mr. Justice Brandeis, declares 
that "the validity of a detention questioned by a petitioner for habeas corpus 
is to be determined by the conditions existing at the time of the final decision 
thereon." (United States <i>ex. rel.</i> Mensevich <i>vs</i>. Tod, 68 Law. ed., 
591.) Conversely, it has been held, detention which was lawful in its inception 
may afterwards become unlawful and the prisoner is then entitled to be 
discharged on habeas corpus, as, for example, where a prisoner has been 
pardoned.</p>The statement therefore that "the city fiscal who has no authority 
to issue warrants of arrest (Hashim vs. Boncan and City Fiscal of Manila, 71 
Phil., 261) was powerless to validate such illegal detention by merely filing 
an information or by any other of his own, either express or implied, must be 
qualified. If by validation of the illegal detention is meant wiping out of the 
penal offense that has already been consummated and which resulted from the 
unlawful detention, there can be no disagreement. But if it means that the 
detention having become illegal because it extended beyond six hours nothing 
short of a warrant of arrest issued by a competent judge could stop the release 
of the prisoners under detention, the conclusion is against law and sound 
principles of jurisprudence.</div>
