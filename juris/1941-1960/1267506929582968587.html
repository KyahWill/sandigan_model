				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On December 20, 1944, at about 8 o'clock in the evening, in 
barrio Lantag, Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, Petra Aguilan, an old woman about sixty 
years of age, was in the kitchen of her house with her two sons, Florenclo and 
Narciso Lacasandile, and the latter's wife, Segunda Somera. They had barely 
finished supper and there was some argument as to whether some fish should have 
been eaten that evening or kept for breakfast the following morning. Appellant 
Moises Acosta, who was stationed in a "garita" some distance away as a 
<i>huko</i> guard of the guerrilla forces and who was drunk, heard the argument 
and proceeded there to investigate. Upon arriving at the foot of the stairs of 
Petra Aguilan's house, he demanded—"Who are complaining here, otherwise I will 
kill." Whereupon, Petra Aguilan replied—"No one is complaining," and proceeded 
to descend the stairs which consisted only of two steps. As she went down, 
appellant Acosta mether and immediately stabbed her in the abdomen below the 
left breast with a bolo he was carrying. Upon being wounded, Petra Aguilan 
rushed to a nearby house where a Dr. Gerardo Espejo was residing.
<p>Meanwhile, Narciso Lacasandile who saw the stabbing of his mother, hurried 
down from the kitchen, disarmed appellant, placed the bolo under a bet (papag), 
and hastened to help his mother who was being brought back by Doctor Espejo. 
Petra Aguilan was laid down on her "papag" and while Doctor Espejo was attending 
to her, Narciso grabbed a piece of bamboo and hit appellant on the back. Narciso 
was immediately subdued by the others who were present. Meanwhile, Doctor Espejo 
was questioning Petra Aguilan as to the identity of her assailant and she 
answered that Moises Acosta was the one who stabbed her. When appellant Acosta, 
who remained in the room but was moving about restlessly, heard her statement, 
he denied having stabbed her and claimed that it was her own son Narciso who did 
the stabbing. Petra Aguilan did not make any reply and she died very shortly 
thereafter. Death was due to hemorrhage and shock according to Doctor Espejo in 
the medical certificate issued by him and in his testimony during the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">These facts have been clearly and indubitably established by 
the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. They are Dr. Gerardo Espejo, who 
brought the wounded woman back to her house and who questioned her before she 
died as to the identity of her assailant; Narciso Lacasandile, who saw the 
stabbing from the kitchen, who disarmed appellant Acosta and who was at his 
mother's bedside when she identified appellant and when she died; and, Segunda 
Somera, wife of Narciso, who also witnessed the crime from the kitchen and who 
was with her mother-in-law until she died. The testimonies of these witnesses 
with regard to the dying declaration of Petra Aguilan are supported by the 
testimonies of appellant Acosta himself and of a defense witness, Melchor 
Espiritu, who testified that the statement of the dying woman which he wrote 
down was: "There is no other else who stabbed me except Moises; he hurt me with 
a bolo."</p>
<p align="justify">The evidence for the defense consists only of the testimony of 
Melchor Espiritu which supports the prosecution's evidence of the dying 
declaration, and the testimony of appellant Acosta himself. Appellant alleges 
that he went to the house of Petra Aguilan to stop the quarrel; that he was met 
by Narciso who tried to grab his bolo to use it against his brother Florencio, 
and that in the ensuing struggle for the bolo, the old woman accidentally 
received a bolo thrust. This version does not ring true and is belied by the 
dying declaration of the victim as fully corroborated by eye-witnesses to the 
tragedy.</p>
<p align="justify">One of the errors ascribed by the appellant to the appealed 
decision is the admission of Exhibit C intended to establish appellant's arrests 
and convictions for various offenses in the past. It is rightly argued by 
appellant that under Rule 123, section 15, prosecution cannot initially attack 
the moral character of the accused, unless the same is put in issue by him. The 
lower court's error, however, is immaterial for even without Exhibit C the 
evidence of appellant's guilt is beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court found appellant guilty of murder with the 
qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength which does not appear to 
be alleged in the information. Neither may that circumstance be regarded as 
aggravating, no advantage having been taken actually by appellant of his 
superior strength to accomplish his criminal purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">The felony committed is homicide with the mitigating 
circumstance of intoxication offset by the aggravating circumstance of 
disrespect of age and sex.</p>
<p align="justify">For all the foregoing, the judgment of the lower court is 
modified and appellant Moises Acosta is hereby sentenced to suffer an 
indeterminate penalty of 10 years of <i>prision mayor</i> to 17 years of 
<i>reclusion temporal</i>, with the accessories of the law; to indemnify the 
heirs of the deceased Petra Aguilan in the sum of P2,000; and to pay the costs. 
It is so ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Ozaeta, Feria, Perfecto, Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">MORAN, C. J.:</p>
<p align="justify">Mr. Justice Pablo voted for this decision.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><b>DISSENTING</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>PARAS, J.:</b></p>
<p align="justify">I believe the facts to be, as contended by the appellant, that 
in the evening of December 20, 1944, the appellant went to the house of Petra 
Aguilan upon hearing a rather loud quarrel taking place therein; that upon 
seeing Narciso and Florencio Lacasandile (sons of Petra), exhcange words, the 
appellant, in his capacity as a homeguard, tried to make a peace move, whereupon 
Narciso, after rebuking the appellant for his intervention, snatched the bolo 
from the waist of the appellant and thereafter threatened to use it against his 
brother Florencio. It was to avoid this contingency that the appellant thereupon 
proceeded to recover the weapon from Narciso who, however, offered resistance. 
In the course of the struggle between teh appellant and Narciso, Petra Aguilan 
approached with a view to pacifying Narciso and, unluckily for her, she had so 
come within a striking distance of the two that she was hit by the bolo which 
was still in the hand of Narciso. That blow caused Petra's death, for which the 
appellant should of course not be held responsible.</p>
<p align="justify">The theory of the defense is more logical under the follwokng 
features of the case: (1) There is absolutely no hint in the record that the 
appellant had any motive for killing Petra Aguilan. Upon the other hand, it is 
undisputed that there was a quarrel, and it is not improbable that Narciso was 
in angry mood when the appellant came in. It is true that the appellant is 
alleged to have been drunk, but it has not been shown that he was in such a 
condition as not to have known what he was doing. On the contrary, there are 
indications that his mind was clear. (2) It is pretended that Narciso saw the 
appellant abruptly stab Petra, and yet it is admitted that Narciso thereafter 
merely disarmed the appellant and put the bolo under a bamboo bed, and that it 
was only when Narciso heard his mother incriminate the appellant that Narciso 
grabbed a piece of bamboo and hit the appellant in the back. If the latter fact 
is true, we cannot believe that Narciso actually saw the alleged stabbing, for 
the simple reason that he would have taken some retaliatory measures right after 
his mother was attacked without cause, and should not have waited until his 
mother pointed to the appellant as the author of the assault. At any rate, if 
Narciso was really an eyewitness, he would naturally have followed a more 
revengeful course than merely disarming the appellant and putting his bolo under 
the bamboo bed. (3) It is not denied that the appellant calmly remained in the 
premises, and when he heard Petra Aguilan accused him, he promptly denied the 
same and stated that it was hereson who did it. Appellant's behavior is quite 
inconsistent with a guilty conscience. (4) It is surprising that Florencio 
Lacasandile, admittedly in the house on the occasion in question, was not 
presented as a witness for the prosecution. The explanation is probably that he 
was an active participant in quarrel, particularly as against Narciso.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the above considerations, I vote for the acquittal 
of the accused Molses Acosta.</p>
<p align="justify">BENGZON, J.:</p> I concur in the above dissent.</div>
