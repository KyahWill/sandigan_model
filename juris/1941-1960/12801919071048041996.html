				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case involves a conflict over certain mining claims in Coron, Palawan, 
between the plaintiff-appellant Palawan Manganese Mines, Inc. (hereafter 
referred to as PALAWAN MANGANESE) and the Kalawag Mining Enterprises (hereafter 
referred to as KALAWAG MINING). On February 13, 1948, the Kalawag Mining filed 
administrative case No. 26 with the Bureau of Mines against the Palawan 
Manganese on the ground that the latter had extracted minerals from a lode claim 
Maloocobe No. 1 located by the former in November, 1936. The case having been 
dismissed by the Bureau of Mines, the Klalawag Mining appealed the case to the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources who rendered decision on March 
10, 1953 on April 23, 1953 and filed on July 6, 1953, the present complaint in 
the Court of First Instance of Palawan against Hon. Fernando Lopez as Secretary 
of Agriculture and Natural Resources and certain persons negotiating under the 
name Kalawag Mining Enterprises.
<p>The defendant-appellee Kalawag Mining filed a motion for dismissal on the 
ground that the complaint was filed out of time. The trial court granted said 
motion and dismissed the complaint. The Palawan Manganese is appealing from that 
order of dismissal.</p>
<p>The only question involved in the present appeal is whether or not the 
complaint was filed with the Court of First Instance of Palawan on time. Section 
61 of Commonwealth Act 137 as amended by Republic Act 746 which took effect on 
June 18, 1952, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"61. Conflicts and disputes arising out of mining locations shall be 
submitted to the Director of Mines for decision, provided, that the decision or 
order of the Director of Mines may be appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture 
and Natural Resources within 30 days from date of its receipt. In case any one 
of the parties should disagree from the decision or order of the Director of 
Mines or of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the matter may 
be taken to the court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days from the receipt 
of such decision or order; otherwise the said decision or order shall be final 
and binding upon the parties concerned."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the above quoted provision of Commonwealth Act 137, as amended, it is 
clear that since at the time the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources was rendered, Republic Act 746 was already in effect, the 
period for taking the case as decided by the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources to the Court of First Instance was thirty days to be counted 
from April 23,1953; however, as already said, the present case was filed in the 
Court of First Instance on July 6,1953, or about 44 days late. Apparently, the 
appellant herein had the impression that the period for such filing of the 
complaint was the period of 90 days provided for the Commonwealth Act 137 before 
its amendment by Republic Act 746. It probably overlooked the amendment reducing 
said period to 30 days. From what we have already said about the period for 
filing the complaint, it is clear that the complaint was filed out of time, and 
so the trial court acted correctly in issuing its order dismissing the case. The 
order of dismissal appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
