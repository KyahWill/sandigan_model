				G.R. No. L-2996, March 06, 1950</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PRECIANO MEJARES ET AL., DEFENDANTS. LUCIO LUANGCO, FEDERICO LUANGCO, ANTONIO JARIOL, BERNARDO GANALON AND LUIS GANALON, APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, 
finding the herein appellants, Lucio Luangco, Federico Luangco, Antonio Jariol, 
Bernardo Ganalon and Luis Ganalon, guilty of sedition with murder and sentencing 
each of then to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to 
indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of Eleuterio llanos in the amount of 
P5,000. The same judgment convicted appellants' seven co-accused, but the latter 
did not appeal.
<p>Under the first error assigned by appellants' counsel <em>de oficio</em>, it 
is contended that the appellants were denied time to prepare for trial. The 
Solicitor General agrees to this contention. It appears that on January 31, 
1948, fifty-nine persons were prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of Leyte 
for the offense of sedition with murder committed on May 4,1947, in the 
municipality of Tanauan, Leyte. On February 4, 1949, the information was amended 
by reducing the number of the accused to twelve. In both informations, the 
herein appellants were included. On February 25, 1949, at nine o'clock in the 
morning, Attorney Fernando Sudario, then representing some of the accused, was 
appointed by the court to act as attorney <em>de oficio</em> for all the other 
accused. After arraignment on the sane clay, said attorney moved for the 
postponement of the trial on the ground that he was not prepared therefor, in 
view of the fact that he was appointed only on that day as attorney for some of 
the accused. This motion was denied by the court which ordered the parties to 
proceed with the trial. After said trial, the court rendered the judgment 
hereinabove indicated.</p>
<p>In stating that he was not prepared for trial, Attorney Sudario argued that, 
as the affidavits of the witnesses for the prosecution were not attached to the 
record, he could not learn the basis of the information. In denying the motion 
for postponement, the trial court ruled that the names of the witnesses for the 
Government are listed in the original and amended informations. Regardless of 
the merit of the ground advanced by Attorney Sudario in support for his motion 
for postponement, or of the merit of the denial by the trial court, the fact is 
conspicuous that defense counsel was not ready for trial on the date the 
appellants were arraigned. Under section 7 of Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, 
after a plea of not guilty, except when the case is on appeal from the justice 
of the peace, the defendant is entitled to at least two days to prepare for 
trial unless the court for good cause shown shall allow further time. This 
requirement has been held to be mandatory and, by its terms, the defendant is 
entitled as of right to at least two days to prepare for trial, and a denial of 
this right is a reversible error and a ground for new trial. (Moran, Comments on 
the Rules of Court, 2d ed., Vol. II, page 688, citing the case of People 
<em>vs</em>. Valte, 43 Phil. 907.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, following the recommendation of the Solicitor General, the 
appealed judgment is hereby set aside and the case remanded to the trial court 
for further proceedings, for the reception of such additional evidence as the 
interest of justice may require, and for the rendition thereafter of the 
corresponding judgment. So ordered, with costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Reyes</em>, and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
