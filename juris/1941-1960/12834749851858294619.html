				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For about five&nbsp; years&nbsp; up to the&nbsp; riling of the&nbsp;&nbsp; original complaint&nbsp;&nbsp; in this case,&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; February 19,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; Pedro Dahil, the herein petitioner, was the&nbsp;&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; of Antonio Crispin, the&nbsp; herein respondent,&nbsp;&nbsp; on an&nbsp;&nbsp; agricultural land&nbsp; located at barrio Santiago, municipality of Botolon,&nbsp; province&nbsp; of Zambales..&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp;&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; year of 1950-1951,&nbsp;&nbsp; the land produced 42&nbsp; caverns of&nbsp; palay,&nbsp;&nbsp; from which 2&nbsp; cavans were&nbsp;&nbsp; taken by the&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; In payment&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 cavans&nbsp; of seedlings used&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the 40&nbsp; cavans were&nbsp;&nbsp; to be&nbsp;&nbsp; divided, the petitioner demanded from the&nbsp; respondent that&nbsp; the division be made&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; 75-25% in his favor,&nbsp;&nbsp; in accordance with Sections&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 and 8&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 4054,&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; there&nbsp; was no previous written agreement between&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; and principally because&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; furnished the necessary implements&nbsp; and work animals and defrayed all the expenses&nbsp; for planting and cultivation&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent did not&nbsp; agree&nbsp; to this demand,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner, for&nbsp; fear&nbsp; of being&nbsp; ejected&nbsp; from the&nbsp; land by the respondent, yielded to the&nbsp; wishes of the latter and the&nbsp; crop was&nbsp; divided on&nbsp; a&nbsp; 50-50 basis,&nbsp;&nbsp; to wit:&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 cavans&nbsp; for the&nbsp; petitioner and&nbsp; 20&nbsp; cavans for&nbsp; the respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp;&nbsp; year 1951-1952,&nbsp; he&nbsp; continued working&nbsp; on the land which produced 51 cavans&nbsp;&nbsp; and 4-1/2 gantas&nbsp; of&nbsp; palay&nbsp; in&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When&nbsp;&nbsp; tills last crop was to be divided,&nbsp;&nbsp; a dispute&nbsp; arose again ac&nbsp; to the share each&nbsp; should receive,&nbsp;&nbsp; hence,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner Initiated this&nbsp; case&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; his lawful share In both&nbsp; crops&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1951-1951&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1951-1952.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before&nbsp; the trial of the case,&nbsp;&nbsp; the liquidation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crop&nbsp; of 1951-1952 was&nbsp; amicably settled, thus the&nbsp; case was tried only with regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; the reliquidation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the 1950-1951 crop.<br><br>After&nbsp; the trial,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial&nbsp; Relations,&nbsp;&nbsp; in a decision penned by the Hon. Associate Judge&nbsp; V. Jimenez Yanson, denied the&nbsp; reliquidation prayed for by the&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner. Immediately thereafter&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter filed a motion for reconsideration alleging&nbsp; that the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision&nbsp; is contrary to law,&nbsp; but the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; sitting&nbsp; in banc affirmed .the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; there was no&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp;&nbsp; justification for&nbsp; altering&nbsp;&nbsp; or modifying&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, this appeal on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; (l)&nbsp; in denying the&nbsp; reliquidation of&nbsp;&nbsp; the net harvest&nbsp; during&nbsp; the agricultural year 1950-1951&nbsp; illegally divided between&nbsp; the ten suit-petitioner and landlord-respondent;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2 )&nbsp;&nbsp; in not&nbsp; finding&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 4054.&nbsp;&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp;&nbsp; regarding the&nbsp; apportionment&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the shares between the&nbsp;&nbsp; landlord and the&nbsp; tenant&nbsp;&nbsp; as mandatory;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; in not&nbsp; finding&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; proportion of&nbsp;&nbsp; shares for&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; and the landlord established In Act No.&nbsp; 4054,&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; right granted by statute&nbsp; and as&nbsp; such right prescribes&nbsp;&nbsp; only after the lapse&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; ten&nbsp; (10) years.<br><br>In denying&nbsp; the petition,&nbsp;&nbsp; the lower court&nbsp; ruled that the&nbsp;&nbsp; crop for&nbsp; the&nbsp; year 1950-1951 had been divided long before the&nbsp; tenant filed his&nbsp;&nbsp; complaint;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; to permit the re liquidation prayed&nbsp; for by the petitioner would be&nbsp;&nbsp; opening&nbsp; the&nbsp; door to&nbsp; further confusion in&nbsp; the&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parties herein;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioner had long&nbsp;&nbsp; slept on his right; and&nbsp;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; grievances,&nbsp; if&nbsp; any,&nbsp;&nbsp; should have been brought to&nbsp; the' attention of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; court immediately after his &nbsp; harvest of the&nbsp; crop in question,&nbsp; and for him to bring the&nbsp;&nbsp; same after the lapse&nbsp;&nbsp; of an duller agricultural year was too late. It&nbsp; appears,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; that the petition was filed in the month of&nbsp;&nbsp; February of 1952 and that&nbsp; only one agricultural year had&nbsp; elapsed from the&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; crop&nbsp; of 1950-1951 was divided between&nbsp;&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; in March 7&nbsp; 1951"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp;&nbsp; is, therefore, no unreasonable&nbsp; delay on&nbsp; the part&nbsp;&nbsp; of the petitioner in bringing&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; action "and&nbsp; the lower court was not justified in&nbsp; concluding that petitioner's action has prescribed because&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ms inaction for nearly a year. Besides, Act No.&nbsp; 4054,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; amen do d,&nbsp;&nbsp; contain no provision as&nbsp; to prescription&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; action that may&nbsp; arise&nbsp; thereunder and consequently Art,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1145&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the now Civil&nbsp; Code, which provides that&nbsp; action based upon&nbsp; oral contract&nbsp; can be&nbsp; filed&nbsp; within six&nbsp; years,&nbsp;&nbsp; nay be&nbsp; applicable&nbsp;&nbsp; to the&nbsp; present&nbsp; case.<br><br>On the&nbsp;&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 8 of Act No.&nbsp; 4054,&nbsp;&nbsp; as amended by Republic&nbsp; Act 3STo»&nbsp;&nbsp; 34—clearly provides that&nbsp; "in the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; any written&nbsp;&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; to&nbsp; the contrary and when&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; furnished the necessary implements and work animals and defrays all the&nbsp;&nbsp; expenses for planting and cultivation of the&nbsp;&nbsp; land,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; crop&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; divided as follows: xxx 75% for&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenant&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; 25% for the landlord in case&nbsp; of loud the&nbsp;&nbsp; average normal production of which&nbsp; is not more&nbsp;&nbsp; than 40 cavans of&nbsp; palay par&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; cavan&nbsp;&nbsp; of seeds. This&nbsp; provision of&nbsp; law is&nbsp; completely applicable&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; case at bar and the&nbsp; 40 cavans of palay in question should have been divided in&nbsp;&nbsp; accordance therewith to wit." 30 cavans for&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; and 10 cavans for the&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent. Consequently,&nbsp;&nbsp; the latter who received&nbsp; 20 cavans,&nbsp;&nbsp; or more&nbsp; than what the law authorizes, is bound to return 10 cavans&nbsp; to the petitioner to&nbsp; complete&nbsp;&nbsp; the latter's shore&nbsp; in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; aforequoted provision of law. Moreover, under Section 7 of the&nbsp; aforementioned Act No.&nbsp; 4054, as&nbsp; amended by Commonwealth Act No. 78 and Section&nbsp; 3 of Republic Act No. 34, the tenant should receive nab&nbsp; less than&nbsp;&nbsp; 55%&nbsp; of the net produce and&nbsp; that any stipulation between the&nbsp; landlord and&nbsp; the tenant&nbsp; to the&nbsp; contrary is declared to be against public policy. The petitioner herein was given in&nbsp; ti&amp; partition&nbsp; complained of a share less 55%, so&nbsp; it is very clear that the&nbsp; policy of the law was&nbsp; violated and, therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; the herein petitioner has right to the reliquidation sought for in the petition and to&nbsp; claim&nbsp; the 10 cavans the respondent received in received of&nbsp; his lawful&nbsp;&nbsp; share.<br><br>"WHEREFORE,&nbsp;&nbsp; the decision appealed&nbsp; from is hereby reversed and the respondent Antonio Crispin&nbsp; ordered to deliver to the petitioner the" ten&nbsp; cavans of palay prayed for in&nbsp; the petition and&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; costs,<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., </i>and<i> <i>Endencia,</i> JJ., </i>concur</div>
