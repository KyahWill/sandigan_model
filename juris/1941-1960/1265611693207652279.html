				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. AMADO V. HERNANDEZ, ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>RESOLUTION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This refers to&nbsp; the petition for bail filed by defendant-appellant Amado Hernandez on June 26, 1954, and renewed on December 22, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar petition, filed on December 28, 1953, had been denied by a resolution of this court dated&nbsp; February 2,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; Although not&nbsp; stated in said resolution, the same was due mainly to these circumstances: The prosecution maintains that Hernandez is charged with, and has been convicted&nbsp; of, rebellion completed with murders,&nbsp; arsons and robberies,&nbsp; for which the capital punishment,&nbsp; it is claimed, may be imposed, although the lower court&nbsp; sentenced him merely to life&nbsp; imprisonment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the other hand, the defense contends, among other&nbsp; things, that rebellion can&nbsp; not be complexed&nbsp; with murder, arson, or robbery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch&nbsp; as the issue&nbsp; thus&nbsp; raised had not been previously settled&nbsp; squarely, and this&nbsp; court was then unable, as yet,&nbsp; to&nbsp; reach a&nbsp; definite conclusion thereon,&nbsp; it was deemed best not&nbsp; to disturb,&nbsp; for the time being, the course of action taken&nbsp; by the lower court,&nbsp; which&nbsp; denied bail to the movant.&nbsp; After&nbsp; mature deliberation,&nbsp; our considered opinion on said issue is as follows:<p>The first two paragraphs of the amended information in this case read:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The undersigned accuses&nbsp; (1) Amado V. Hernandez <em>alias</em> Victor <em>alias</em> Soliman&nbsp; <em>alias</em> Amado&nbsp; <em>alias</em> AVH <em>alias</em> Victor Soliman, (2) Guillermo Capadocia <em>alias</em> Huan Bantiling <em>alias</em> Cap <em>alias</em> G. Capadocia,&nbsp; (3) Mariano P. Balgos <em>alias</em> Bakal <em>alias</em> Tony Collantes <em>alias</em> Bonifacio,&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Alfredo Saulo <em>alias</em> Elias <em>alias</em> Fred&nbsp; <em>alias</em> A.B.S. <em>alias</em> A.B., (5)&nbsp; Andres Baisa, Jr. <em>alias</em> Ben <em>alias</em>&nbsp; Andy (6) Genaro de la Cruz <em>alias</em> Gonzalo <em>alias</em> Gorio <em>alias</em> Arong, (7)&nbsp; Aquilino Bunsol <em>alias</em> Anong, (8) Adriano Samson <em>alias</em> Danoy, (9) Juan J. Cruz <em>alias</em> Johnny 2, <em>alias</em> Jessie Wilson <em>alias</em> William,&nbsp; (10)&nbsp; Jacobo&nbsp; Espino, (11)&nbsp; Amado Racanday,&nbsp; (12) Fermin Rodillas,&nbsp; and&nbsp; (13)&nbsp; Julian Lumanog <em>alias</em> Manue, of the crime of&nbsp; rebellion with multiple murder, arsons and robberies committed as follows:&nbsp; </p><p>"That on or about March 15, 1945, and for some&nbsp; time before the said date and&nbsp; continuously thereafter until the present&nbsp; time, in the City&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the place which&nbsp; they&nbsp; had chosen&nbsp; as the&nbsp; nerve center&nbsp; of all their rebellious activities in the different parts of the&nbsp; Philippines, the said.accused,&nbsp; conspiring, confederating, and cooperating with each other, as&nbsp; well as with the thirty-one&nbsp; (31) defendants&nbsp; charged in criminal&nbsp; cases Nos. 14071, 14082, 14270, 14315, and 14344 of the Court of First Instance of Manila (decided May 11, 1951) and also with others whose whereabouts and identities are still unknown, the said&nbsp; accused and their co-conspirators, being then officers and/or members of, or otherwise associated with the Congress of&nbsp; Labor Organizations&nbsp; (CLO) formerly known as the Committee on Labor Organization&nbsp; (CLO), an active agency, organ, and instrumentality of the Communist Party&nbsp; of the Philippines&nbsp; (P.K.P.),&nbsp; with central offices in Manila and chapters and affiliated or associated labor&nbsp; unions and other 'mass organizations' in&nbsp; different places in&nbsp; the Philippines, and as&nbsp; such agency,&nbsp; organ, and instrumentality, fully cooperates in, and synchronizes itjs activities with the&nbsp; rebellious activities&nbsp; of the 'Hukbong Magpalayang Bayan, (H.M.B.) and other organs, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Communist Party&nbsp; of the Philippines (P.K.P.) to thereby&nbsp; assure, facilitate,&nbsp; and&nbsp; effect&nbsp; the&nbsp; complete and&nbsp; permanent success&nbsp; of the armed rebellion against the Republic of the Philippines, as the herein defendants and their co-conspirators have in&nbsp; fact synchronised the activities of the CLO&nbsp; with the&nbsp; rebellious activities of the HMB and other agencies,&nbsp; organs and instrumentalities of the Communist Party of the Philippines and have otherwise master-minded or promoted the cooperative efforts between the CLO and HMB and other agencies, organs, and instrumentalities of the P.K.P. in the prosecution of the rebellion against the Republic of the Philippines, and being then also high ranking officers and/or members of, or otherwise affiliated with, the Communist Party of the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; (P.K.P.), which is now actively engaged&nbsp; in an armed rebellion against the Government of the Philippines through acts therefor committed and planned to&nbsp; be further&nbsp; committed in Manila and other places in the Philippines, and of which party the 'Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan'&nbsp; (HMB), otherwise or formerly known as the 'Hukbalahaps' (Huks), is the armed force, did then and there willfully, unlawfully&nbsp; and feloniously help, support, promote, maintain, cause, direct and/or command the 'Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan' (HMB) or the 'Hukbalahaps'&nbsp; (Huks) to rise publicly and&nbsp; take arms against the Republic of the Philippines, or otherwise participate in such&nbsp; armed public uprising, for the purpose of removing&nbsp; the territory of the&nbsp; Philippines from the allegiance to the government and laws thereof as in fact the said 'Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan' or 'Hukbalahaps' have risen publicly and taken arms&nbsp; to attain the said&nbsp; purpose by then and there making armed raids,&nbsp; sorties and&nbsp; ambushes, attacks&nbsp; against&nbsp; police, constabulary and army detachments as well&nbsp; as innocent civilians, and&nbsp; as a&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; means&nbsp; to commit&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of&nbsp; rebellion, in connection therewith and in furtherance thereof, have then and there committed acts of murder, pillage, looting, plunder, arson, and planned destruction of private and public property to create and spread chaos, disorder, terror, and fear so as to facilitate the accomplishment of the aforesaid purpose, as follows, to wit:"&nbsp; </p><p>Then follows a description of&nbsp; the murders,&nbsp; arsons and robberies allegedly perperated by the accused "as a necessary means to commit the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; rebellion, in connection therewith and in furtherance thereof."</p></blockquote><p>Article 48 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code&nbsp; provides that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"When a single act constitutes two or more&nbsp; grave or less grave felonies, or when an&nbsp; offense is a necessary means&nbsp; for committing the other,&nbsp; the penalty for the&nbsp; most&nbsp; serious crime shall be&nbsp; imposed, the same&nbsp; to be applied in&nbsp; its maximum&nbsp; period."</p></blockquote><p>It is obvious, from the language of this article, that the same presupposes&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of&nbsp; two&nbsp; (2) or more crimes, and, hence,&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; apply&nbsp; when the culprit is guilty of only one&nbsp; crime.</p><p>Article&nbsp; 134 of said&nbsp; code&nbsp; reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The crime of rebellion&nbsp; or&nbsp; insurrection&nbsp; is&nbsp; committed by rising publicly and taking arms&nbsp; against the Government for the purpose of removing from the&nbsp; allegiance to said Government&nbsp; or its laws, the territory of the Philippine Islands or any part thereof, of any body of land, naval or other armed forces, or&nbsp; of&nbsp; depriving the Chief Executive&nbsp; or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any&nbsp; of&nbsp; their powers or&nbsp; prerogatives."</p></blockquote><p>Pursuant&nbsp; to Article&nbsp; 135 of the same code "any person, merely participating or executing the commands of&nbsp; others in a rebellion shall suffer the penalty of<em> prision mayor</em> in its minimum period."</p><p>The penalty is increased to<em> prision&nbsp; mayor</em> and a fine not to exceed P20,000 for "any person who promotes, maintains or heads&nbsp; a rebellion or insurrection or who, while holding any public office or employment, takes part therein":&nbsp; </p><ol><li>"engaging in&nbsp; war against the forces&nbsp; of the&nbsp; government",</li>&nbsp; <li>"destroying&nbsp; property",&nbsp; or</li>&nbsp; <li>"committing&nbsp;&nbsp; serious&nbsp; violence", </li>&nbsp; <li>"exacting contributions or"</li>&nbsp; <li>"diverting public funds from the lawful purpose for which&nbsp; they have been&nbsp; appropriated".</li></ol><p>Whether performed singly or collectively, these five (5) classes of acts constitute only one offense, and no&nbsp; more, and are, altogether, subject to only one penaltyâ€”<em>prision mayor</em> and a fine not to&nbsp; exceed P20,000.&nbsp; Thus for instance, a public officer who assists the rebels by turning over to them, for use in&nbsp; financing the uprising, the public&nbsp; funds entrusted to his custody, could neither be prosecuted for malversation&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; funds, apart&nbsp; from&nbsp; rebellion,&nbsp; nor accused and convicted&nbsp; of the complex&nbsp; crime of rebellion with malversation&nbsp; of&nbsp; public funds.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason is that such malversation&nbsp; is inherent in the&nbsp; crime of rebellion committed by him.&nbsp; In fact, he would not be guilty of rebellion&nbsp; had&nbsp; he not so misappropriated&nbsp; said funds.&nbsp; In the imposition, upon said public officer, of the penalty for rebellion it would even be improper to consider the aggravating circumstance of advantage taken by the offender of&nbsp; his public&nbsp; position,&nbsp; this being an essential element of the crime he had&nbsp; perpetrated.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; then, if the&nbsp; office held by said offender and the nature of the funds malversed by&nbsp; him cannot aggravate the penalty for his offense, it is clear that neither may it worsen the very crime committed by&nbsp; the culprit by&nbsp; giving&nbsp; rise, either&nbsp; to&nbsp; an independent crime, or to&nbsp; a complex crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless&nbsp; to say, a mere participant in the rebellion, who is not a&nbsp; public officer, should not&nbsp; be placed at a&nbsp; more disadvantageous position than the promoters, maintainers or&nbsp; leaders of the movement,&nbsp; or the public&nbsp; officers who join the&nbsp; same, insofar as&nbsp; the application&nbsp; of Article 48&nbsp; is&nbsp; concerned.</p><p>One of the means by which rebellion may be committed, in&nbsp; the words&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Article 135, is by "engaging in war against the forces of&nbsp; the&nbsp; government" and "committing serious violence" in the prosecution of&nbsp; said "war".&nbsp; These expressions imply everything that war connotes, namely; resort to arms, requisition of property and services, collection of taxes and contributions, restraint of liberty, damage to property, physical injuries and loss of life, and the hunger, illness&nbsp; and unhappiness that war&nbsp; leaves in&nbsp; its wakeâ€”except that, very often, it is worse than war in the international sense, for it involves internal struggle, a fight between brothers, with a bitterness and passion or ruthlessness seldom found in a contest between strangers.&nbsp; Being within the purview of "engaging in war" and "committing serious violence'", said resort to arms, with the&nbsp; resulting impairment or destruction of life and property, constitutes not&nbsp; two or&nbsp; more&nbsp; offense, but only one crimeâ€”that&nbsp; of rebellion plain and simple.&nbsp; Thus, for instance,&nbsp; it has been held that "the&nbsp; crime of treason may be committed&nbsp; 'by executing <em>either a single or similar intentional overt acts, different or similar but distinct, and for that reason, it may be considered one single continuous offense.</em>&nbsp; (Guinto <em>vs.</em> Veluz, 77&nbsp; Phil., 801,&nbsp; 44 Off. Gaz., 909.)"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Peoples. Pacheco, 93 Phil., 521.)</p><p>Inasmuch as the acts specified in said Article&nbsp; 135 constitute, we repeat, one single crime, it follows&nbsp; necessarily that said acts offer no&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; for the application&nbsp; of Article&nbsp; 48,&nbsp; which&nbsp; requires therefor the commission of, at least,&nbsp; two crimes.&nbsp; Hence, this&nbsp; court&nbsp; has never in&nbsp; the past, convicted&nbsp; any person of the "complex crime of rebellion with murder".&nbsp; What is more, it appears that in every one&nbsp; of the cases of rebellion published in the Philippine Reports, the defendants were convicted of simple rebellion, although they had killed several persons, sometimes peace officers (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Lagnason, 3 Phil.,&nbsp; 472; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Baldello, 3 Phil,&nbsp; 509, U. S. <em>vs.</em> Ayala, 6&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 151;&nbsp; League <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; People, 73 Phil., 155).</p><p>Fallowing a parallel line are our decisions in the more recent cases of treason, resulting from collaboration with the Japanese during the war in the Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, said cases went&nbsp; further&nbsp; than the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of rebellion,&nbsp; in that the theory&nbsp; of the prosecution to&nbsp; the effect that the accused in&nbsp; said treason&nbsp; cases were guilty of the complex crime of treason with murder and&nbsp; other crimes was&nbsp; expressly and&nbsp; repeatedly&nbsp; rejected&nbsp; therein. Thus, commenting on the&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; People's Court finding the accused&nbsp; in People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Prieto&nbsp; (80 Phil., 138, 45&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 3329)&nbsp;&nbsp; "guilty of&nbsp;&nbsp; * * * &nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of treason complexed by murder and&nbsp; physical injuries"&nbsp; and sentencing him&nbsp; to&nbsp; death,&nbsp; and on&nbsp; the&nbsp; contention of the Solicitor General that Prieto had committed&nbsp; the "complex crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; treason&nbsp; with&nbsp; homicide", this cburt,&nbsp; speaking through Mr. Justice&nbsp; Tuason, said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The execution of&nbsp; some of&nbsp; the&nbsp; guerrilla suspects&nbsp; mentioned in these&nbsp; counts and the infliction of physical injuries on others are not offenses separate from&nbsp; treason.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine treason law and under the United States constitution denning treason, after&nbsp; which the former was&nbsp; patterned, there must concur both adherence to&nbsp; the enemy and giving him aid and comfort.&nbsp; One without the other does not make treason.&nbsp; </p><p>"In the nature of tilings, the giving of aid and comfort can only be accomplished by some&nbsp; kind&nbsp; of action. Its very nature partakes, of a&nbsp; deed&nbsp; or physical activity as opposed&nbsp; to a&nbsp; mental&nbsp; operation. (Cramer <em>vs.</em> U.S., ante.)&nbsp; This deed or physical activity may be, and&nbsp; often&nbsp; is,&nbsp; in itself&nbsp; a&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; offense under&nbsp; another&nbsp; penal statute or&nbsp; provision.&nbsp; Even&nbsp; so,&nbsp; <em>when the deed is&nbsp; charged as an element of&nbsp; treason it becomes&nbsp; identified with&nbsp; the latter crime and can not be the subject of a separate punishment, or used in combination with treason to increase the penalty as&nbsp; Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code provides.</em>&nbsp; Just as one can not be punished for possessing opium in a prosecution for smoking the identical drug, and a robber cannot be held guilty of coercion or trespass to a dwelling&nbsp; in a prosecution for robbery,&nbsp; because possession of opium and force and trespass are inherent in smoking and&nbsp; in&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; respectively, so may not a&nbsp; defendant be made liable for murder as a separate crime or in conjunction with another offense where, as&nbsp; in this case, it is averred as a&nbsp; constitutive&nbsp; ingredient&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; treason.&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; Where murder or&nbsp; physical injuries&nbsp; are&nbsp; charged as overt&nbsp; acts of treason* * * they can&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; regarded&nbsp; separately&nbsp; under&nbsp; their&nbsp; general denomination."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp;&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Accordingly, we convicted the accused&nbsp; of&nbsp; simple&nbsp; treason and&nbsp; sentenced him to life<em> imprisonment.</em></p><p>In People <em>vs.</em> Labra, 81&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 377, 46&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz., Supp. No. 1, p. 159, we used the following&nbsp; language:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The lower court found&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; guilty not&nbsp; only&nbsp; of treason, but of&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; for the killing of&nbsp; Tomas&nbsp; Abella, and,&nbsp; following the provisions of Article 48 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code&nbsp; sentenced him to death,&nbsp; the maximum&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; provided by article&nbsp; 114. "The lower court erred in finding appellant guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; the murder of Tomas Abella.&nbsp; The arrest and killing of Tomas Abella for being a guerilla, is alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; count 3 of the information, as one of&nbsp; the&nbsp; elements of the crime&nbsp; of treason for which&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; is prosecuted.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; element&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; a&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; legal&nbsp; basis upon&nbsp; which appellant stands&nbsp; convicted of the crime&nbsp; of treason. The killing of Tomas Abella cannot be considered as legal ground for convicting&nbsp; appellant of&nbsp; any&nbsp; crime other than&nbsp; treason.&nbsp; The essential elements&nbsp; of&nbsp; a given crime&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; disintegrated&nbsp; in different parts,&nbsp; each&nbsp; one&nbsp; stand&nbsp; as&nbsp; a separate&nbsp; ground to&nbsp; convict the accused&nbsp; of&nbsp; a different&nbsp; crime or&nbsp; criminal offense.&nbsp; The elements constituting a given&nbsp; crime are integral and inseparable parts of a whole.&nbsp; In the contemplation of the law, they&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; used for double or multiple purposes.&nbsp; They can&nbsp; only be used for the sole&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of showing&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of which&nbsp; they&nbsp; form&nbsp; part.&nbsp; The&nbsp; factual&nbsp; complexity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of treason does not&nbsp; endow it with&nbsp; the&nbsp; functional&nbsp; ability&nbsp; of worm multiplication or amoeba reproduction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the accused will have&nbsp; to face as many prosecutions and convictions&nbsp; as&nbsp; there are elements in the&nbsp; crime of treason, in open violation of the constitutional&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; against double jeopardy."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>The same&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; was&nbsp; reached&nbsp; in&nbsp; People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Ali botod&nbsp; 82 Phil.,&nbsp; 164, 46 Off. Gaz., 1005, despite the&nbsp; direct participation of the defendant therein in the maltreatment and killing of several persons.</p><p>In&nbsp; People <em>vs.</em> Vilo 82 Phil., 524, 46 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 2517, we held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The People's Court, however, erred in classifying the crime&nbsp; as treason with murder.&nbsp; The killing&nbsp; of&nbsp; Amado Satorre&nbsp;&nbsp; and one Segundo is charged&nbsp; as an&nbsp; element of&nbsp; treason,&nbsp; and&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore becomes identified with the latter&nbsp; crime, <em>and&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be the subject of a separate punishment or used in combination with treason to&nbsp; increase&nbsp; the penalty as Article&nbsp; 48 of the Revised Penal Code provides,"</em>&nbsp; (People <em>vs.</em> Prieto, L-399, 45 Off. Gaz. 3329.&nbsp;&nbsp; See, also People <em>vs.</em> Labra, L-386,&nbsp; 46&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [Supp. to&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1], 159.)" (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>To the same effect was our decision in People <em>vs.</em> Roble 83&nbsp; Phil., 1, 46&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 4207.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; stated therein:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; court held that the facts alleged in the information&nbsp; is a complex crime of&nbsp; treason with murders, with&nbsp; the result&nbsp; that the penalty&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; the most serious offense&nbsp; was to be imposed on its maximum degree.&nbsp; Viewing the case from&nbsp; the standpoint of modifying circumstances, the court believed&nbsp; that the&nbsp; same result obtained.&nbsp; It&nbsp; opined&nbsp; that the killings were&nbsp; murders&nbsp; qualified by treachery&nbsp; and&nbsp; aggravated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; of&nbsp; evident&nbsp; premeditation, superior strength, cruelty, and an armed band.&nbsp; </p><p>"We&nbsp; think <em>this&nbsp; is&nbsp; error.</em>&nbsp; The tortures&nbsp; and murders set&nbsp; forth in the information are merged in and formed part of the treason. They&nbsp; were in this case the overt acts which, besides traitorous intention supplied a vital ingredient in the crime."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>The&nbsp; accused&nbsp; in People <em>vs.</em> Delgado 83 Phil., 9,&nbsp; 46&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 4213,&nbsp; had been&nbsp; convicted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; People's Court of&nbsp; "the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; treason&nbsp; complexed with the crime of murder" and sentenced to the&nbsp; extreme&nbsp; penalty.&nbsp; In&nbsp; our decision, penned by Mr. Justice Montemayor, we expressed ourselves as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; herein&nbsp; was&nbsp; and&nbsp; is a&nbsp; Filipino citizen.&nbsp; His adherence to the&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; forces of occupation&nbsp; and giving them aid and comfort by acting as&nbsp; their spy,&nbsp; undercover man, investigator, and even&nbsp; killer when necessary to cow&nbsp; and compel the inhabitants to&nbsp; surrender&nbsp; their firearms&nbsp; and&nbsp; disclose&nbsp; information about the guerrillas has been fully established.&nbsp; His&nbsp; manner of&nbsp; investigation and maltreatment of&nbsp; some of his&nbsp; victims like&nbsp; Tereso&nbsp; Sanchez and Patricio Suico,&nbsp; was so cruel, brutal and&nbsp; inhuman that it is almost unbelievable that&nbsp; a&nbsp; Filipino can commit and practice such&nbsp; atrocities especially on his own countrymen.&nbsp; But, evidently, war, confusion and opportunism&nbsp; can and do&nbsp; produce&nbsp; characters and&nbsp; monster unknown during&nbsp; peace&nbsp; and normal&nbsp; times.&nbsp; </p><p>"The&nbsp; People's Court found the appellant guilty of&nbsp; treason&nbsp; complexed&nbsp; with&nbsp; murder.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp; General,&nbsp; however, maintains that the&nbsp; offense&nbsp; committed is simpletreason, citing&nbsp; the&nbsp; doctrine laid down by this court&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; People <em>vs.</em> Prieto,&nbsp; (Lâ€”399, 45&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 3329)&nbsp; but accompanied by the aggravating circumstance under Article 14,&nbsp; paragraph 21,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code, and not&nbsp; compensated&nbsp; by&nbsp; any mitigating&nbsp; circumstance,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he recommends the imposition&nbsp; of the penalty of death.&nbsp; We agree with the Solicitor General&nbsp; that&nbsp; on the basis&nbsp; of the ruling of this&nbsp; court in the case of People <em>vs.</em> Prieto, supra, the appellant may be&nbsp; convicted only of treason, and that the killing and infliction of physical injuries committed&nbsp; by&nbsp; him may&nbsp; not be&nbsp; separated&nbsp; from the crime of treason but&nbsp; should&nbsp; be regarded as acts performed in the commission of treason, although, as&nbsp; stated in said&nbsp; case, the brutality with which the&nbsp; killing&nbsp; or physical injuries were carried out&nbsp; may be taken&nbsp; as an&nbsp; aggravating circumstance."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>and reduced the&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; from death&nbsp; to&nbsp; life&nbsp; imprisonment and a&nbsp; fine of&nbsp; P20,000.</p><p>Identical were the&nbsp; pertinent&nbsp; features&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of People <em>vs.</em> Adlawan,&nbsp; 83 Phil., 194,&nbsp; 46&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 4299, in which,&nbsp; through Mr. Justice Reyes&nbsp; (A),&nbsp; we declared:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * * we find&nbsp; merit in the contention that appellant should have not been convicted of the so-called 'Complex crime&nbsp; of treason with murder, robbery, and rape.'&nbsp; The killings, robbery, and raping mentioned&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; information&nbsp; are&nbsp; therein&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; not&nbsp; as&nbsp; specific offenses but as mere elements&nbsp; of (the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; treason&nbsp; for&nbsp; which the accused is&nbsp; being prosecuted.&nbsp; Being merged in&nbsp; and identified with the general&nbsp; charged, they&nbsp; can not be used in combination vrith the&nbsp; treason&nbsp; to increase the penalty under Article&nbsp; US of the Revised Penal Ctfde.&nbsp; (People <em>vs.</em> Prieto,&nbsp; L-339, January 29,&nbsp; 1948, 45 Off.

But the court&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; and, after petitioner had pleaded&nbsp; not&nbsp; guilty, proceeded&nbsp; to&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; whereupon,&nbsp; the present petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari and&nbsp; prohibition was&nbsp; filed in&nbsp; this&nbsp; court&nbsp; to have the trial&nbsp; judge&nbsp; desist from proceeding with the trial and dismiss the case.&nbsp; </p><p>"It is, however, claimed that the offense charged in the military court different from that charged in the&nbsp; civil&nbsp; court and that&nbsp; even granting that the&nbsp; offense was identical the&nbsp; military court had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same because the People's Court had previously&nbsp; acquired jurisdiction over the case&nbsp; with the result that the conviction in the court martial was void. In support of the first point, it is urged that the amended&nbsp; information filed in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Zamboanga contains overt acts distinct from those charged in&nbsp; the military court.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we note that while certain overt acts specified in the amended information&nbsp; in the Zamboanga court were not specified in the indictment in the court martial,&nbsp; they all are embraced in the general&nbsp; charge of&nbsp; treason, which is&nbsp; a continuous offense and one who commits ft is not criminally liable for as many crimes as there are overt acts, because all evert act 'he has done or might have done for&nbsp; that purpose constitute but a&nbsp; single&nbsp; offense.&nbsp; (Guinto <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Veluz, 44&nbsp; Off. Gaz., ,909; People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Pacheco,&nbsp; L-4750, promulgated July 31, 1953.)&nbsp; In other words, since the offense charged in the amended information in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Zamboanga is treason, the&nbsp; fact that the said&nbsp; information contains an enumeration of additional overt&nbsp; acts not specifically mentioned in the indictment&nbsp; before&nbsp; the military court is immaterial since the new alleged overt&nbsp; acts do not&nbsp; in themselves constitute a new and&nbsp; distinct&nbsp; offense from&nbsp; that of&nbsp; treason,&nbsp; and this court has repeatedly held that a person cannot be found guilty of treason and&nbsp; at the same&nbsp; time also&nbsp; guilty of&nbsp; overt acts specified in the information for treason even if those&nbsp; overt acts considered separately t are&nbsp; punishable&nbsp; by&nbsp; law,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the simple&nbsp; reason that those&nbsp; overt&nbsp; acts are&nbsp; not&nbsp; separate offenses distinct from&nbsp; that of treason&nbsp; but constitute&nbsp; ingredients thereof.**&nbsp; (Italics suuplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Thus, insofar as treason is concerned, the opinion of this court, on the&nbsp; question whether&nbsp; said. crime&nbsp; may be&nbsp; complexed&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp; murder, when the former&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; committed through the latter,&nbsp; and it is so alleged in&nbsp; the information, had positively and clearly crystalized itself in the negative as early as January 29, 1948.</p><p>We have not overlooked the decision in&nbsp; People <em>vs.</em> Labra (L-1240, decided on May 12, 1949), the dispositive part of which partly reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Wherefore, the verdict&nbsp; of&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; must be&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; Articles 48, 114&nbsp; and 248 of the Revised Penal Code&nbsp; are applicable to the offense of treason with murder.&nbsp; However for lack of sufficient votes to impose the extreme penalty, the appellant will&nbsp; be&nbsp; sentenced to life imprisonment.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *."</p></blockquote><p>Although it mentions Articles 48 and 248 of the Revised Penal Code and "the offense of treason with murder," it should be noted that vie&nbsp; affirmed therein the action of the People's Court, which, according to the opening statement of our decision, convicted Labra of "treason aggravated with murder".&nbsp; Besides, the applicability of said articles was not discussed in said decision.&nbsp; It is obvious, from a mere perusal thereof, that this court had no intention of passing upon such&nbsp; question.&nbsp; Otherwise, it would&nbsp; have explained&nbsp; why it did not follow the rule laid down in the previous cases of Prieto, Labra (August 10,&nbsp; 1948), Alibotod,&nbsp; Vilo,&nbsp; Roble,&nbsp;&nbsp; Delgado and Adlawan&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>),&nbsp; in which&nbsp; the issue was&nbsp; explicitly examined and decided in the negative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp; continued&nbsp; adherence to this view in the subsequent cases of&nbsp; Suralta,&nbsp; Navea,&nbsp; Pacheco&nbsp; and Crisologo, without even a passing reference to the second Labra&nbsp; case, shows that&nbsp; we did not consider the same as reflecting&nbsp; the opinion of the court on&nbsp; said&nbsp; question.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate,&nbsp; insofar as&nbsp; it&nbsp; suggests otherwise,&nbsp; the position taken in the second&nbsp; Labra case must be deemed reversed by our decisions in said&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of Suralta,&nbsp; Navea, Pacheco and Crisologo.</p><p>It is true&nbsp; that&nbsp; treason and rebellion are&nbsp; distinct and different from each&nbsp; other.&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not&nbsp; detract, however, from the rule&nbsp; that the ingredients of a crime form part and parcel thereof, and, hence, are absorbed&nbsp; by the same and cannot be punished either separately therefrom or by&nbsp; the application&nbsp; of Article 48 of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides there is more reason to apply said&nbsp; rule in the crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; rebellion than in that of treason, for the law punishing&nbsp; rebellion&nbsp;&nbsp; (Article 135, Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code) specifically mentions tne act&nbsp; of engaging in war and committing serious violence&nbsp; among its essential elementsâ€” thus clearly indicating that&nbsp; everything done in the prosecution of said war,&nbsp; as a&nbsp; means necessary therefor, is embraced&nbsp; thereinâ€”unlike the&nbsp; provision on&nbsp; treason&nbsp; (Article 114,&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code)&nbsp; which is less&nbsp; explicit thereon.</p><p>It is urged that, if the crime of assault upon a person in authority&nbsp; or an&nbsp; agent of a person in authority may be committed with&nbsp; physical injuries&nbsp; (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Montiel, 9 Phil.,&nbsp; 162), homicide&nbsp; (People <em>vs.</em> Lojo,&nbsp; 52 Phil.,&nbsp; 390) and&nbsp; murder&nbsp; (U. S.&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Ginosolongo,&nbsp; 23 Phil., 171; U.&nbsp; S. <em>vs.</em> Baluyot, 40&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 385), and rape may&nbsp; be perpetrated with physical injuries (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Andaya,&nbsp; 34 Phil., 690), then rebellion may,&nbsp; similarly, be complexed with murder, arson, or robbery.&nbsp; The&nbsp; conclusion Does&nbsp; not follow, for engaging in&nbsp; war, serious&nbsp; violence, physical&nbsp; injuries and destruction of life and property are inherent in rebellion, but&nbsp; not&nbsp; in assault upon persons in authority or agents&nbsp; of persons&nbsp; in authority&nbsp; or&nbsp; in&nbsp; rape.&nbsp;&nbsp; The word "rebellion" evokes, not merely a challenge&nbsp; to&nbsp; the constituted authorities, but, also, civil&nbsp; war, on&nbsp; a bigger or lesser scale, with all the evils&nbsp; that go&nbsp; with&nbsp; it,&nbsp; whereas, neither rape nor assault&nbsp; upon&nbsp; persons&nbsp; in authority connotes necessarily, or even&nbsp; generally, either physical&nbsp; injuries, or murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p>In support of the theory that a rebel who kills&nbsp; in furtherance of&nbsp; the insurrection&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; guilty of&nbsp; the complex crime of rebellion&nbsp; with murder,&nbsp; our attention has been called to Article 244 of the old Penal Code of the&nbsp; Philippines, reading:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Los delitos&nbsp; particulares&nbsp; cometidos en una rebeli6n o sedicion, o con&nbsp; motivo de&nbsp; ellas,&nbsp;&nbsp; seran castigados&nbsp; respectivamente&nbsp; segun&nbsp; las disposiciones de este Codigo.&nbsp; </p><p>"Cuando no&nbsp; puedan&nbsp; descubrirse sns autores seran penados comb tales los&nbsp; jefes&nbsp; principales de la rebelion o sedicion."</p></blockquote><p>and to&nbsp; the following observations of&nbsp; Cuelto Calon&nbsp; (Derecho Penal, Vol. II, p.&nbsp; 110), in&nbsp; relation&nbsp; thereto:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Se&nbsp; establece aqui&nbsp; que&nbsp; el&nbsp; en una&nbsp; rebelion&nbsp; o sedicion,&nbsp; o&nbsp; con motivo de ellas, comete otros&nbsp; delitos (v.g., roba, mata olesiona), sera responsable de estos ademas de los delitos de rebelion o sedicion.&nbsp; La dificultad consiste en estos casos en separar los accidentes de la rebelion&nbsp; o sedicion de&nbsp; los delitos&nbsp; independientes&nbsp; de&nbsp; estas, y como las&nbsp; leyes no contienen en este punto precepto alguno aplicable,&nbsp; su solucion ha&nbsp; quedado encomendada a los tribunales.&nbsp; La jurisprudencia que estos han sentado considera&nbsp; como accidentes de la rebelion o sedicionâ€”cuya criminalidad queda embedida en la de estos&nbsp; delitos, y,&nbsp; por&nbsp; tanto, no son punibles especialmenteâ€”los hechos de escasa gravedad&nbsp; (v.g., atentados, desacatos, lesiones menos graves); por el contrario,&nbsp; las infracciones graves,&nbsp; como&nbsp; el&nbsp; asesinato o las lesiones graves, se consideran como&nbsp; delitos&nbsp; independientes&nbsp; de la rebelion o de la sedicion."</p></blockquote><p>It should be noted, however, that said Article 244 of the old Penal&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of the Philippines has not&nbsp; been included in our Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; If the applicability of Article 48&nbsp; to rebellion was determined by the existence of said Article 244, then the elimination of the latter would be indicative&nbsp; of the contrary.</p><p>Besides, the crime of&nbsp; rebellion, referred to&nbsp; by&nbsp; Cuello Calon, was that punished in the Spanish Penal Code,&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 243&nbsp; of which&nbsp; provides:</p><p>"<em>Son&nbsp; reos de rebelion</em>&nbsp; los&nbsp; que&nbsp; se&nbsp; alzaren&nbsp; publicamente y ev abierta&nbsp; hostilidad contra el Gobierno para cualquiera de los objetos siguientes:&nbsp; </p><ol><li>"Destronar&nbsp; al Rey, deponer al Regente o Regencia del Reino, o privarles de su libertad personal n obligarles a ejecutar on&nbsp; acto contrario a su voluntad.</li>&nbsp; <li>"Impedir la celebracion de las elecciones para&nbsp; Diputados a Cortes o Senadores en todo el Reino, o la&nbsp; reunion legitima de las</li>&nbsp; <li>"Disolver las Cortes o impedir la deliberacion de alguno de los Cuerpos Colegisladores o&nbsp; arrancarles alguna resolucion.</li>&nbsp; <li>"Ejecutar cuallquiera de los delitos previstos en el artfculo 165.</li>&nbsp; <li>"Sustraer&nbsp; el Reino o parte de el o algun&nbsp; cuerpo de tropa de tierra&nbsp; o de mar, o cualquiera otra clase de fuerza armada, de la obediencia&nbsp; del&nbsp; Supremo Gobierno.</li>&nbsp; <li>"Usar y ejercer por si o despojar a los Ministros de la Corona de sus facultades constitucionales, o impedirles b coartarles su libre ejercicio.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Articulo&nbsp; 167, Codigo Penal de&nbsp; 1850.â€”Veanse las demas concordancias del articulo 181.)"</li></ol><p>Thus, the Spanish Penal Code did not specifically declare that rebellion includes the act of engaging in war against the forces of the Government and of using serious violence for the purposes stated in Article 134&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of this&nbsp; express statutory inclusion&nbsp; of the acts of war and&nbsp; serious violence among the&nbsp; ingredients of rebellion in&nbsp; the Philippines, it is&nbsp; clear that&nbsp; the distinction made&nbsp; by&nbsp; Cueilo Calon between&nbsp; grave and less grave offenses committed in the course of an insurrection cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; accepted in&nbsp; this jurisdiction.&nbsp; Again, if&nbsp; both classes&nbsp; of offenses are&nbsp; part and parcel of a rebellion, or means necessary therefor,&nbsp; neither law nor logic justifies the exclusion of the one and the inclusion of the other.&nbsp; In fact, Cueilo Calon&nbsp; admits that "the difficulty lies in separating the&nbsp; accidents of rebellion or sedition from the offenses independent therefrom."&nbsp; Ergo, offenses that are not&nbsp; independent therefrom, but. constituting&nbsp; an integral part thereofâ€”committed, precisely, to carry out the uprising to its successful conclusionâ€”are beyond the purview of Article 244.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the above quoted statement of Cueilo Calonâ€”to the effect that grave felonies committed in the course&nbsp; of&nbsp; an insurrection are&nbsp; independent&nbsp; therefromâ€” was based upon a decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of February 5, 1872, which we find reported in the Codigo Penal&nbsp; de&nbsp; Filipinas, by&nbsp; Jose Perez Rubio,&nbsp; as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"El Tribunal Supremo de Justicia&nbsp; en sentencia&nbsp; de&nbsp; 5 de&nbsp; Febrero de 1872, tiene decWado:&nbsp;&nbsp; Que segun los articulos 184 del Codigo Penal de 1830, y 259 del reformado (1870), los delitos particulars cometidos en una rebelion o sedici6n o con motivo de ellas se castigan respectivamente segun las disposiciones de los mismos Codigos;&nbsp; y con arreglo al decreto de amnistia de 9 de Agosto de 1876 estan solo comprendidos en aquella gracia las personas sentenciadas, procesadas 6 aujetas a responsabilidad por delitos&nbsp; politicoa de cualquiera especie cometidos desde el 29 de Septiembre&nbsp; de 1868; Que el asesinato del Gobernador Civil de Burgos no fui resultado de movimiento alguno politico,&nbsp; sino de&nbsp; un&nbsp; mero&nbsp; tumulto&nbsp; que imprimio el fanatismo, y cuya tunica aparente tendencia era impedir jue aquel funcionario inventariase ciertos objetos artisticos, que se&nbsp; decian existentes&nbsp; en la Catedral: Que esto&nbsp; lo demuestran las salvajes voces de muerte proferidas por los asesinos contra la persona del Gobernador;&nbsp; sin que al ejecutar en el mismo recinto del&nbsp; templo los horrorosos hechos que aparecen en la causa, alzasen bandera politica&nbsp; alguna ni dieran otrb grito que el, en aquel momento&nbsp; sacrilego e" impio, de&nbsp; 'Viva la religion:' Que la&nbsp; apreciar la Sala sentenciadora los hechos referentes al Gobernador Civil de delito de asesinato, penarlo con arreglo al Codigo y declarar&nbsp; inaplicable&nbsp; el&nbsp; citado Decreto de&nbsp; Amnistia, no ha cometido el error de derecho senalado en los casos 1.Â°&nbsp; ZJ del articulo 4.Â° de la ley sobre establecimiento de la casacion criminal, ni infringido los articulos 250 y 259 del&nbsp; Codigo Penal de 1870."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Page 239; Italics&nbsp; supplied.)&nbsp;&nbsp; (See, also, "El&nbsp; Codigo&nbsp; Penal", by Hidalgo Garcia,&nbsp; Vol.&nbsp; I, p. 623.)'</p></blockquote><p>It&nbsp; is apparent&nbsp; that said&nbsp; case is&nbsp; not in point.&nbsp; There was no issue therein on whether murder may be completed with rebellion or sedition.&nbsp; The&nbsp; question for determination was whether ttye killers&nbsp; of the&nbsp; victim were guilty&nbsp; of the common crime&nbsp; of murder, or should have been convicted only&nbsp; of rebellion or sedition.&nbsp; The court adopted the first alternative, not because of&nbsp; the&nbsp; gravity of the&nbsp; acts performed by the&nbsp; accused, but&nbsp; because they&nbsp; had no political motivation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the footnote to said quotation from Cuello&nbsp; Calon&nbsp; reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Los&nbsp; atentados desacatos y lesiones a&nbsp; la autoridad u&nbsp; otros delitos contra el orden publico cometidos en la sedicidn o con&nbsp;

said Article 244, which&nbsp; refers, not to all&nbsp; offenses&nbsp; committed&nbsp; in the course of a rebellion or on the occasion thereof, but only to "delitos particulares" or common crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, what are "delitos particulares" as the&nbsp; phrase is used in said article 244?&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote from Viada:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Las disposicidn defi primer parrafo de este artfculo no puede&nbsp; ser mas justa;&nbsp; con arreglo a ella, los delitos&nbsp; particulares o comunes cometidos en&nbsp; una rebelidn&nbsp; or sedici6n no deberanv reputarse corao accidentes&nbsp; inherentes a&nbsp; estas, sino como delitos especiales, a dicha rebelidn y&nbsp;

o sedicion?&nbsp;&nbsp; En&nbsp; cuanto&nbsp; a la rebelion, no&nbsp; ofrece&nbsp; esta cuestion dificultad alguna, pues todo hecho&nbsp; que no este comprendido en tmo y&nbsp; otro&nbsp; de los&nbsp; objetos&nbsp; especificados en los seis numeros del articulo 243 sera extrano a la rebeli6n, y si se ballare definido en algun otro articulo del Codigo, con arreglo a este debera ser castigado como delito&nbsp; particular.&nbsp; Pero tratandose de la sedicion, comprendiendose como objetos de la misma, en los numeros 3.Â°, 4.Â° y 5.Â° del articulo 250, hechos que constituyen otros tantos ataques a&nbsp; las personas o a la propiedad, cuales se consideran como accidentes&nbsp; inherentes a la propria&nbsp; sedici6n,&nbsp; y cuales deberan&nbsp; reputarse como delitos particulares&nbsp; o comunes?&nbsp; En cuanto a los casos de&nbsp; los numeros 4.Â°&nbsp; y 5. , estimanos&nbsp; que el objeto politico y social que se requiera&nbsp; para la realizaci&amp;n&nbsp; de&nbsp; los actos en aqueUos eomprendidos es el que&nbsp; debe servirnos de norma y guia para distinguir lo inherente a la sedicidn de lo que es ajeno o extrano a ella.&nbsp; Cuando no&nbsp; exista&nbsp; ese&nbsp; objeto politico y social, el acto de odio o&nbsp; venganza, ejercido contra los particulares o cualquiera&nbsp; clase del Estado, y el atentado contra&nbsp; las&nbsp; propiedades&nbsp; de los&nbsp; ciudadanos&nbsp; o corporaciones mentados en&nbsp; el numero 5."&nbsp; del articulo&nbsp; 250,&nbsp; no seran constitutivos del&nbsp; delito de sedicidn, sino&nbsp; que deberan&nbsp;

la persona o bienes de alguna Autoridad o sus agentes, estimamos que deberan reputarse como delitos comunes todos&nbsp; aquellos hechos innecesarios <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> para la consecucion del fin particular que se propusieran los&nbsp;

esfuerzos de los&nbsp; sublevados.&nbsp;&nbsp; Asi, en el caso de&nbsp; la Cuesti6n&nbsp; 1 expuesta en&nbsp; el comentario&nbsp; del&nbsp; articulo&nbsp; 258, es evidente&nbsp; que el fin que se propusieron los sediciosos fue no pagar el&nbsp;

lo persiguieron&nbsp; y llegaron hasta lesionarle.&nbsp; Esas amenazas y lesiones no pudieron apreciarse, ni las aprecio tampoco la Sala sentenciadora, como delito comiin, sino&nbsp; como acddente inherente a la misma sedition, por cuanto fueron un medio racionalmente necesario para la consecudin del fin deierminado que se propusieron los culpables.&nbsp; </p><p>"Pero&nbsp; cuando&nbsp; tal&nbsp; necesidad&nbsp; desaparece, cuando se&nbsp; Were por herir, cuando se mata por matar,&nbsp; el hecho ya, no pttede&nbsp; ser&nbsp; considerado&nbsp; como un accidente propio de la&nbsp;

He says:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"La doctrina cientifica considera los delitos llamados politicos como infracdones&nbsp; de un caracter especial distintas de los denominados delitos comunes. De esta apreciacion ha nacido&nbsp; la division de los delitos, desde el punto&nbsp; de vista de su naturaleza intrinseca, en delitos politicos y delitos comunes&nbsp; o de derecho comun.&nbsp; </p><p>"Se reputan delitos comunes aquellos que&nbsp; lesionan bienes juridicos individuales&nbsp; (v. gr., los delitos&nbsp; contra la vida,&nbsp; contra la honestidad, contra la&nbsp; propiedad, etc.).&nbsp; </p><p>"La nocion del delito pcflltico no parece tan clara.&nbsp; Desde&nbsp; luego revisten&nbsp; este caracter los que&nbsp; atentan contra&nbsp; el orden politico del Estado, contra su orden&nbsp; externo&nbsp; (independencia de la&nbsp; nacion, integridad del&nbsp; territorio,&nbsp; etc.), o contra el interno (delitos contra el Jefe del Estado, contra la&nbsp; forma de&nbsp; Gobierno, etc.).&nbsp; Pero tambien pueden eer considerados como politicos&nbsp; todos los delitos,&nbsp; cualesquiera que sean incluso&nbsp; los de derecho com/An,&nbsp; cuando fueron cometidos por moviles politicos.&nbsp; Deben,&nbsp; por tanto,, estimarse como&nbsp; infracciones de&nbsp; esta clase, no solo las que&nbsp; objetivamente tengan tal caracter por el interes politico que lesionan,&nbsp; sino tambien las que, apreciadas subjetivamente, maninestan una motivactdn de caracter politico.&nbsp; </p><p>"Asl&nbsp; podria formulares&nbsp; esta definici6n:&nbsp; es&nbsp; delito politico&nbsp; el cometido&nbsp; contra el&nbsp; orden politico del Estado, asi como todo&nbsp; delito de cualquiera otra clase deierminado&nbsp; por moviles politicos."&nbsp; (Cuello Calon, Derecho Penal, Tomo I,&nbsp; pp. 247-249.)</p></blockquote><p>In short, political crimes are those directly aimed against the political order, as well as such&nbsp; common&nbsp; crimes as may be committed to achieve a political purpose.&nbsp; The decisive factor is the intent or motive.&nbsp; If a crime usually regarded as common, like homicide, is perpetrated for the purpose of removing from the allegiance "to the Government the territory of the Philippines Islands&nbsp; or&nbsp; any part thereof." then said offense becomes stripped of its "common"&nbsp; complexion, inasmuch as, being part and parcel of the crime of rebellion, the former acquires the political character of the latter.</p><p>Conformably&nbsp; with the foregoing, the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of murder against the defendant&nbsp; in U.&nbsp; S. <em>vs.</em> Lardizabal&nbsp; (1 Phil., 729)â€”an insurgent&nbsp; who killed a prisoner&nbsp; of war because he was too weak to march with the retreating rebel forces, and could not be left behind&nbsp; without endangering the safety of the latterâ€”was dismissed&nbsp; upon the ground that the execution of said prisoner of war formed part of, and was included in, the&nbsp; crime of sedition, which, in turn, was covered&nbsp; by an&nbsp; amnesty, to the&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; of which&nbsp; said defendant was entitled.</p><p>True, in U. S. <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Alfont&nbsp; (1 Phil., 115), the commander of an unorganized group of insurgents was, pursuant to Article&nbsp; 244 of our old&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; convicted of homicide for having shot and killed&nbsp; a woman who was driving a vehicle.&nbsp; But the complex crime of rebellion with homicide was not considered in that case.&nbsp; Apart from this, the accused failed to established the relation between her death and the insurrection. What is more, it&nbsp; was neither proved nor alleged that he had&nbsp; been prompted by political reasons. In other words, his offense was independent from the rebellion.&nbsp; The latter was merely the occasion for the commission of the former.</p><p>It is noteworthy&nbsp; that&nbsp; the aforementioned decisions of this court and the&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp; of Spain in&nbsp; cases of treason, rebellion and sedition, are&nbsp; in line with&nbsp; the trend in other countries, as well as in the field of international relations.&nbsp; Referring to the question&nbsp; as to what offenses are political&nbsp; in nature, it was&nbsp; said in&nbsp; In re&nbsp; Ezeta&nbsp; (62&nbsp; Fed. Rep.,&nbsp; 972) :&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"What constitutes an offense&nbsp; of a political character has not yet been determined by judicial authority.&nbsp; Sir James Stephens,&nbsp; in his work, History of the&nbsp; Criminal Law of&nbsp; England&nbsp; (Volume 2, p. 71), thinks&nbsp; that it should be 'interpreted to mean that fugitive criminals are not to be&nbsp; surrendered&nbsp; for extradition crimes if those crimes were incidental to and formed a part of political&nbsp; disturbances.'&nbsp; Mr. John Stuart&nbsp; Mill, in&nbsp; the house of commons,&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1866, while discussing an amendment to the act of 'extradition, on which&nbsp; the&nbsp; treaty between&nbsp; England&nbsp; and France&nbsp; was founded, gave&nbsp; this&nbsp; definition: Any offense committed in the course of or furthering of civil war, insurrection,&nbsp; or political&nbsp; commotion,'&nbsp; Hansard's Debates Vol. 184, p. 2115.&nbsp; In the Castioni Case,&nbsp; supra, decided in 1891, the question was discussed by the&nbsp; most eminent counsel at the English bar, and considered by distinguished judges, without a definition being framed that would draw&nbsp; a fixed and&nbsp; certain line&nbsp; between&nbsp; a municipal or common crime and one of political character. 'I do not think,' said Denman, J., 'it is necessary or&nbsp; desirable&nbsp; that we should&nbsp; attempt to put into&nbsp; language, in the shape of an. exhaustive definition, exactly the whole state of things, or every state of things, which might bring a particular&nbsp; case within the description of an offense of a political character.'&nbsp; In that case, Castioni&nbsp; was&nbsp; charged with the&nbsp; murder of&nbsp; one Rossi, by shooting&nbsp; him with a&nbsp; revolver, in the&nbsp; town of Bellinzona, in the canton of Ticino, in Switzerland.&nbsp; The deceased, Rossi,&nbsp; was a member of the state council of the canton of Ticino. Castioni was a citizen of the same canton.&nbsp; For&nbsp; some time previous to the&nbsp; murder; much&nbsp; dissatisfaction had been felt and expressed by a large number of inhabitants of Ticino&nbsp; at the&nbsp; mode in which the political&nbsp; party then in power were conducting&nbsp; the&nbsp; government of the canton.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request was presented to the government for&nbsp; a&nbsp; revision&nbsp; of the constitution of the canton and, the&nbsp; government having declined to take a popular vote on&nbsp; that&nbsp; question, a&nbsp; number&nbsp; of the citizens of Bellinzona, among whom was Castioni, seized the arsenal of the&nbsp; town,&nbsp; from which they took rifles&nbsp; and ammunition, disarmed the gendarmes,&nbsp; arrested&nbsp; and bound&nbsp; or handcuffed&nbsp; several&nbsp; persons connected with the government, and forced them to march in front of&nbsp; the armed crowd to the&nbsp; municipal palace.&nbsp; Admission to the&nbsp; palace was demanded in the name of the people, and was&nbsp; refused by Rossi&nbsp; and another member&nbsp; of the government,&nbsp; who&nbsp; were in the palace. The crowd then broke open the outer gate of the palace, and rushed&nbsp; in,&nbsp; pushing before&nbsp; them&nbsp;&nbsp; the government&nbsp; officials whom&nbsp; they had arrested and bound.&nbsp; Castioni, who was armed with a&nbsp; revolver,&nbsp; was&nbsp; among&nbsp; the first to enter.&nbsp; A second door, which was locked, was broken open, and at this time, or immediately after, Rossi, who was in the passage,&nbsp; was shot through the body&nbsp; with&nbsp; a revolver, and died very soon&nbsp; afterwards.&nbsp; Some other&nbsp; shots were fired,&nbsp; but no one else was injured.&nbsp; Castioni fled to England,&nbsp; His extradition was requested by the federal council of Switzerland.&nbsp; He was arrested and taken before a police magistrate, as provided by the statute,&nbsp; who&nbsp; held&nbsp; him for extradition.&nbsp; Application&nbsp; was&nbsp; made by the accused&nbsp; to the high court&nbsp; of&nbsp; justice of England&nbsp; for&nbsp; a writ of habeas corpus.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; represented by&nbsp; Sir Charles&nbsp; Russell, now lord chief justice.&nbsp; The&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; general, Sir Richard Webster, appeared for the crown, and the solicitor&nbsp; general, Sir Edward Clarke,&nbsp; and Robert Woodfal, for the federal council of Switzerland. This array&nbsp; of distinguished counsel, and the high character of the court, commends the case as one of&nbsp; the highest authority.&nbsp; It appeared from an admission by one of the parties engaged in the disturbances 'that&nbsp; the&nbsp; death of Rossi was a&nbsp; misfortune,&nbsp; and not necessary for the&nbsp; rising/&nbsp; The opinions of the judges as to the political character&nbsp; of the crime&nbsp; charged against Castioni,&nbsp; upon the facts stated, is exceedingly interesting, but I need only refer to' the following passages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Denman says:&nbsp; </p><p>"The question really is whether, upon the facts, it is&nbsp; clear that the man was acting as one of a number of persons engaged in acts&nbsp; of violence of&nbsp; a political character with a political object, and as part of the political movement and rising in which he was taking part.' "Judge Hawkins, in commenting upon the&nbsp; character of political offenses, said:&nbsp; </p><p>'I cannot&nbsp; help thinking that&nbsp; everybody&nbsp; knows&nbsp; there are, many acts&nbsp; of a&nbsp; political&nbsp; character&nbsp; done&nbsp; vrithout&nbsp; reason,&nbsp; done&nbsp; against all reason;&nbsp; but&nbsp; at the same time one&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; look too&nbsp; hardly, and weigh in golden scales the acts of men hot in their political excitement.&nbsp; We&nbsp; know that in heat,&nbsp; and in heated blood,&nbsp; men&nbsp; often do things which are against and contrary&nbsp; to reason; but none&nbsp; the 'less an act&nbsp; of this description may be done for the purpose of furthering and in&nbsp; furtherance&nbsp; of a political rising, even&nbsp; though it&nbsp; is an act which may&nbsp; be deplored&nbsp; and&nbsp; lamented,&nbsp; as&nbsp; even cruel and against all reason,&nbsp; by those&nbsp; who can calmly&nbsp; reflect upon it after&nbsp; the battle is over.'&nbsp; </p><p>"Sir&nbsp; James Stephens, whose definition as&nbsp; an author has&nbsp; already been cited,&nbsp; was one of the judges,&nbsp; and joined in the views taken as to the political character of&nbsp; the crime charged&nbsp; against Castioni.

Thus, said provision, if construed in conformity with the theory of the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; would be unfavorable to the movant.</p><p>Upon the other, hand, said Article 48 was&nbsp; enacted&nbsp; for tfee purpose of&nbsp; favoring the culprit, not of sentencing him to a penalty more severe than that which would be proper if the several acts performed by him were punished separately.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the word&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rodriguez Navarro:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"La unificacion de penas en los&nbsp; casos de concurso de delitos&nbsp; a que hace referenda este articulo (75 de Codigo de 1932), esta basado francamente en el principio pro reo." (II Doctrina Penal del Tribunal Supremo de Espana, p. 2168.)'</p></blockquote><p>We are aware of the fact that&nbsp; this observation&nbsp; refers to Article 71&nbsp; (later 75)&nbsp; of the Spanish Penal Code&nbsp; (the counterpart of our Article 48), as amended in 1908 and then&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1932,&nbsp; reading:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Las disposiciones del articulo anterior no son aplicables&nbsp; en el caso de que un solo hecho constituya dos o mas delitos, o cuando el uno de ellos sea medio necesario para cometer el otro.&nbsp; </p><p>"En estos casos solo se impondra la pena correspondiente al delito mas grave&nbsp; en su grado maximo, hasta el limite que&nbsp; represente la suma&nbsp; de&nbsp; las que pudieran imponerse,&nbsp; penando separadamente los delitos.&nbsp; </p><p>"Cuando&nbsp; la pena asi computada exceda de este limite,&nbsp; se sancionaran los&nbsp; delitos por separado."&nbsp; (Rodriguez&nbsp; Navarro, Doctrino Penal del&nbsp; Tribunal Supremo, Vol. II,&nbsp; p. 2163.)</p></blockquote><p>and that bur Article 48 does not contain the qualification inserted in said amendment, restricting the&nbsp; imposition&nbsp; of the penalty for the&nbsp; graver offense&nbsp; in&nbsp; its maximum period to the case when it does not exceed the sum total of the penalties imposable if the acts charged&nbsp; were dealt' with separately.&nbsp; The&nbsp; absence of&nbsp; said&nbsp; limitation&nbsp; in&nbsp; our Penal Code does not, to our mind, affect substantially the spirit of&nbsp; said Article 48.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, if one act constitutes two&nbsp; or more offenses, there can be no reason to inflict a&nbsp; punishment graver than&nbsp; that prescribed&nbsp; for&nbsp; each one&nbsp; of&nbsp; said offenses put together.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; directing that the penalty for the graver offense be, in such case, imposed in its maximum period, Article 48 could have had&nbsp; no other&nbsp; purpose than to&nbsp; prescribe a penalty&nbsp; lower than the aggregate&nbsp; of the penalties for&nbsp; each offense,&nbsp; if&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; separately.&nbsp; The reason for this&nbsp; benevolent spirit of Article 48 is readily discernible.&nbsp; When two or more crimes are the result of a single act, the offender is deemed less perverse than when he commits said crimes thru separate and distinct acts. Instead of sentencing him&nbsp; for&nbsp; each&nbsp; crime independently from the other, he&nbsp; must&nbsp; suffer&nbsp; the&nbsp; maximum&nbsp; of the penalty for the more serious one, on the assumption that it is less grave than the sum total of the separate penalties for each offense.</p><p>Did the framers&nbsp; of Article 48 have a different purpose in dealing therein with an offense which is a means necessary for the commission of another?&nbsp; To begin with, the culprit can not, then,&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as displaying a greater degree of malice&nbsp; than when the two offenses are independent of each&nbsp; other.&nbsp; On the contrary,&nbsp; since one offense is a necessary means for the commission of the other, the evil intent is one, which, at least, quantitatively, is lesser than when the two offenses are unrelated to each&nbsp; other, because, in such&nbsp; event, he is twice guilty of having harbored criminal&nbsp; designs and&nbsp; of carrying the same&nbsp; into execution. Furthermore, it&nbsp; must&nbsp; be presumed that the object of Article US,&nbsp; in&nbsp; its entirety, is&nbsp; only one.&nbsp; We&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; assume that the purpose of the lawmaker, at the beginning of the single sentence of which said article consists, was to favor the accused, and&nbsp; that,&nbsp; before the sentence endedf the former had a change&nbsp; of heart and&nbsp; turned&nbsp; about face against the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the second part of Article 48 had been meant to be unfavorable to the accusedâ€”and, hence, the exact opposite&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; first&nbsp; partâ€”each would&nbsp; have&nbsp; been placed in separate provisions, instead of in one single article.&nbsp; If the first part sought to impose, upon the culprit, a&nbsp; penalty less grave than that which he would deserve if the two or more offenses&nbsp; resulting from his single act&nbsp; were punished separately, then this, also,&nbsp; must be the purpose of the second part, in dealing with an offense which&nbsp; is a necessary means for the&nbsp; commission of another.</p><p><em>The accuracy of this conclusion is borne out by the fact that, since 1850,&nbsp; when the counterpart of our Article US was inserted in the Penal Code of Spain,&nbsp; or for&nbsp; over a century,&nbsp; it does not appear to&nbsp; have been applied&nbsp; by the Supreme Court thereof to crimes of murder committed in furtherance of an insurrection.</em></p><p>Incidentally, we cannot&nbsp; accept&nbsp; the&nbsp; explanation&nbsp; that crimes committed as a means necessary for the success of a rebellion had&nbsp; to&nbsp; be prosecuted&nbsp; separately under the provisions of Article 259&nbsp; of the Penal Code of Spain, which is the counterpart of Article 244&nbsp; of our old Penal Code. To begin with, these articles are part of a substantive law. They do not govern the manner or method of prosecution of the culprits.&nbsp; Then again, said&nbsp; precepts ordain that&nbsp; common crimes committed during a&nbsp; rebellion or sedition, or on the occasion thereof, "shall be&nbsp; respectively punished&nbsp; according to the provisions of this Code."&nbsp; Among&nbsp; such provisions was Article 90 (later Article 71, then Article 75) of the Spanish Penal Code, and Article 89 of our&nbsp; old Penal Code, of which Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines is a&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; reproduction. Hence, had the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Spain or the Philippines believed that murders committed as a means necessary&nbsp; to attain the aims of an uprising&nbsp; were "common" crimes,&nbsp; the same would have been complexed with the rebellion or sedition, as the case may&nbsp; be.</p><p>The cases of People <em>vs.</em> Cabrera&nbsp; (43 Phil., 64) and People <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Cabrera (43&nbsp; Phil., 82) have&nbsp; not escaped our attention.&nbsp; Those cases involved members of the constabulary who rose publicly, for the purpose&nbsp; of performing&nbsp; acts of hate&nbsp; and vengeance upon the police force of Manila, and in an encounter with the latter, killed some members thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Charged with and convicted&nbsp; of sedition in the first case, they were accused of murder in the second case.&nbsp; They pieaded double jeopardy in the second case, upon the ground tiiat&nbsp; the facts alleged in the information were&nbsp; those&nbsp; set forth in the charge in the first case, in which&nbsp; they had been convicted.&nbsp; This plea was rejected upon the ground that the organic law prohibited double jeopardy for the same offense, and that the offense of sedition is distinct and different from that of murder, although both were the result of the same act.</p><p>The question whether one offence was&nbsp; inherent in, or identified with, the other was not discussed or even considered in said cases.&nbsp; Besides, the lower court applied, in the murder case Article 89 of the old Penal Codeâ€”which is the counterpart of Article 48 of the Revised Penal Codeâ€” but this Court refused to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, simply because one act may constitute two or more offenses, it does&nbsp; not follow necessarily that a person may be prosecuted for one after conviction for the other,&nbsp; without violating the&nbsp; injunction against double jeopardy.&nbsp; For&nbsp; instance, if a man fires a shotgun at another,&nbsp; who suffers thereby several injuries, one of which produced his death, may he, after&nbsp; conviction for murder or homicide, based upon said fatal&nbsp; injury, be accused or convicted, in a separate case, for the non-fatal injuries sustained by the victim? Or may the&nbsp; former be convicted of the complex crime of murder or homicide with serious and/or less serious physical injuries?&nbsp;&nbsp; The mere formulation of these questions&nbsp; suffices to show that the limitation of the&nbsp; rule on&nbsp; double jeopardy to a subsequent prosecution for&nbsp; the same offense&nbsp; does not constitute&nbsp; a license for the separate prosecution of two offenses resulting from the same act, if one offense is an essential element of the other.&nbsp; At any rate, as regards this phase of the issue, which was not touched in the Cabrera cases, the rule therein laid down must necessarily be considered modified by our decision in the cases of&nbsp; People <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Labra&nbsp; (46&nbsp; Off. Gaz., Supp. No. 1, p. 159) and&nbsp; Crisologo&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> People&nbsp; and Villalobos&nbsp; (supra),&nbsp; insofar as inconsistent therewith.</p><p>The main argument&nbsp; in support of the&nbsp; theory seeking to complex rebellion with murder and other offenses is that "war"â€”within the purview of the laws on rebellion&nbsp; and seditionâ€”may be "waged" or&nbsp; "levied"&nbsp; without killing.</p><p>This premise does not warrant, however, the conclusions drawn therefromâ€”that any killing done in furtherance of a rebellion or sedition is independent therefrom, and may be complexed therewith, upon the ground that destruction of human life is not indispensable to the waging or levying of war.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; person may kill&nbsp; another without&nbsp; inflicting physical&nbsp; injuries upon the latter, such, for instance, as by poisoining, drowning, suffocation or shock. Yet it&nbsp; is admitted that he who fatally stabs another cannot be convicted&nbsp; of homicide&nbsp; with&nbsp; physical&nbsp; injuries.&nbsp; So too,&nbsp; it is undeniable that treason may be committed without torturing or murdering&nbsp; anybody.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, it is well-settled that a citizen who gives aid and comfort to the enemy by taking direct part in&nbsp; the&nbsp; maltreatment and assassination of his (citizen's) countrymen,&nbsp; in&nbsp; furtherance of the&nbsp; wishes of said enemy, is&nbsp; guilty of plain treason,&nbsp; not&nbsp; complexed with murder or physical injuries, the later beingâ€”as charged and provenâ€”mere ingredients of the former.&nbsp; Now then, if homicide may be an ingredient of treason, why can it not be an ingredient of rebellion?&nbsp; The proponents of the idea of rebellion complexed with homicide, etc., have not even tried to&nbsp; answer this question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither have they assailed the wisdom of&nbsp; our aforementioned&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; in treason cases.</p><p>The Court is conscious of the keen interest displayed, and the considerable efforts exerted, by the Executive Department in the apprehension&nbsp; and prosecution of those believed to be guilty of&nbsp; crimes against public order, of the lives&nbsp; lost,&nbsp; and the time&nbsp; and money spent in connection therewith, as well as of the possible&nbsp; implications or repercussions in the security of the State. The careful consideration&nbsp; given to said policy&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; coordinate and co-equal branch of the Government is reflected&nbsp; in the time consumed, the extensive and intensive research work undertaken, and the&nbsp; many meetings held by the&nbsp; members of the court for the purpose of elucidating on the question&nbsp; under discussion and of settling&nbsp; the same.</p><p>The role&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judicial department under the Constitution is, however, clearâ€”to settle justiceable controversies by the application of the law.&nbsp; And the latter must be enforced as it isâ€”with all its flaws and defects, not affecting its&nbsp; validityâ€”not as the judges would have it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; other words, the courts must apply the policy of the State as set forth in its laws, regardless of the wisdom thereof.</p><p>It is evident to us that the policy of&nbsp; our statutes on rebellion is&nbsp; to&nbsp; consider all acts committed in furtherance thereofâ€”as&nbsp; specified in Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Codeâ€”as constituting&nbsp; only&nbsp; one crime, punishable with one single penaltyâ€”namely, that prescribed in said Article 135.&nbsp; It is interesting&nbsp; to note, in&nbsp; this connection, that the penalties provided in our old Penal Code&nbsp; (Articles 230 to 232) were much&nbsp; stiffer, namely:&nbsp; </p><ol><li> <em>Life imprisonment to death</em>â€”for the promoters, maintainers and leaders of the rebellion, and, also,&nbsp; for&nbsp; sub-ordinate officers&nbsp; who&nbsp; held positions&nbsp; of authority,&nbsp; either civil or ecclesiastical, if the purpose of the movement was to proclaim&nbsp; the independence of any&nbsp; portion of the Philippine territory; &nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li><em>Reclusion&nbsp; temporal</em> in its&nbsp; maximum periodâ€”for said promoters,&nbsp; maintainers and leaders of the&nbsp; insurrection, and for its subordinate&nbsp; officers, if the&nbsp; purpose of the rebellion was&nbsp; any&nbsp; of those enumerated&nbsp; in&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 229, except that&nbsp; mentioned in the preceding paragraph;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li><em>Reclusion temporal:</em> (a) for subordinate officers other than those already adverted to; and&nbsp; (b) for mere participants in the rebellion falling under the first paragraph of No. 2 of Article 174; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li><em> Prision mayor</em> in its medium period to reclusion temporal in its&nbsp; minimum periodâ€”for participants not falling, under No. 3.</li></ol><p>After the&nbsp; cession of the Philippines to the United States, the rigors of the old Penal Code were tempered.&nbsp; Its aforementioned provisions&nbsp; were superseded by section&nbsp; 3 of Act No. 292, which reduced the penalty to imprisonment for not more than ten (10) years and a fine not exceeding $10,000, or P20,000, for "every person who incites, sets on foot, assists or engages in any rebellion&nbsp; or insurrection *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; or who gives aid and comfort to any one so engaging in&nbsp; such rebellion or insurrection."&nbsp; Such liberal attitude was adhered to by the authors of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The penalties therein are substantially identical to those prescribed in&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 292.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code increased slightly the&nbsp; penalty of imprisonment for the promoters,&nbsp; maintainers&nbsp; and leaders&nbsp; of&nbsp; the uprising,&nbsp; as well as for public officers joining the same, to a maximum not exceeding twelve (12) years of priswn mayor, it reduced the,&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; of imprisonment&nbsp; for mere participants&nbsp; to not&nbsp; more than&nbsp; eight&nbsp; (8) years&nbsp; of&nbsp; priswn&nbsp; mayor,&nbsp; and eliminated the fine.</p><p>This benign mood of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code becomes more significant when we bear&nbsp; in mind it&nbsp; was approved on December 8, 1930 and became effective on January 1, 1932.&nbsp; At that&nbsp; time the communists in the&nbsp; Philippines had&nbsp; already&nbsp; given ample proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; their widespread activities and of their designs and potentialities.&nbsp; Prior thereto, they had been&nbsp; under surveillance by the agents of the law, who gathered evidence of their subversive movements, culminating in the prosecution&nbsp; of Evangelista, Manahan (57 Phil., 354; 57&nbsp; Phil., 372), Capadocia (57 Phil., 364), Feleo&nbsp; (57 Phil., 451), Nabong (57 Phil., 455), and&nbsp; others. In fact, the first information against the first two&nbsp; alleged that they committed the crime of inciting to&nbsp; sedition "on and during the month of November, 1930, and for sometime prior and subsequent thereto."</p><p>As if this were not enough, the very Constitution adopted in&nbsp; 1935, incorporated&nbsp; a formal and solemn&nbsp; declaration (Article II, section 5) committing the Commonwealth, and, then the Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines, to the&nbsp; "promotion of&nbsp; social justice".&nbsp; Soon&nbsp; later,&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 103, creating the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations, was&nbsp; passed.<br></p><p>Then followed a number&nbsp; of&nbsp; other statutes&nbsp; implementing said constitutional mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not necessary to go into the details of said legislative enactments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffice&nbsp; it to say that the same are predicated upon a recognition of the fact that a good many of the&nbsp; problems confronting the State are due to social and economic evils, and&nbsp; that, unless the latter&nbsp; are removed or, least&nbsp; minimized, the former will keep on harrassing the community and affecting the well-being of its members.</p><p>Thus, the settled policy&nbsp; of&nbsp; our laws&nbsp; on rebellion, since the begining of&nbsp; the century, has been&nbsp; one of&nbsp; decided leniency,&nbsp; in&nbsp; comparison with&nbsp; the laws&nbsp; enforce&nbsp; during the Spanish regime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such policy has not suffered the slightest alteration.&nbsp; Although the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; has,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; past five or six years, adopted a more vigorous course of action in the apprehension of violators of said law and in their prosecution, the established policy of the State,&nbsp; as regards the punishment&nbsp; of the culprits&nbsp; has remained&nbsp; unchanged since 1932.&nbsp; It is not for us to&nbsp; consider&nbsp; the merits and demerits&nbsp; of&nbsp; such policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This falls within the province of the policy-making branch of the governmentâ€”the Congress of the Philippines.&nbsp; However, the following quotation from Cuello Calon indicates the schools&nbsp; of thought on this subject and the reason&nbsp; that may have influenced our&nbsp; law-makers in making their choice:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Durante muchos siglos, hasta tiempos relativamente cercanos, se reputaban&nbsp; los hechos que hoy&nbsp; llamamos delitos politicos como mas graves y peligrosos que los crimenes&nbsp; comunes. Se&nbsp; consideraba que mientras estos&nbsp; solo causan un dano&nbsp; individual,&nbsp; aquellos produqen profundas&nbsp; perturbaeiones en lla vida collectiva llegando a poner en peligro&nbsp; la misma vida del Estado.&nbsp; En consonancia con estas&nbsp; ideas fueron reprimidos con extraordinaria&nbsp; severidad y designados con la denominacion romana de delitos de lesa majestad se catalogaron en las leyes penales como los crimenes mas temibles.</p></blockquote><p>"Pero desde hace&nbsp; poco mas&nbsp; de un&nbsp; siglo se ha realizado&nbsp; en este punto una&nbsp; transformation profunda merced a la cual la delincuencia politica dejo de apreciarse&nbsp; con los severos criterios de antano quedando sometida a un regimen penal, por regla&nbsp; general suave y benevolo.<br></p><p>"El origen de este cambio se remonta, segun opinion muy difundida, a la revolucion que tuvo lugar en Francia en&nbsp; el ano 1830,&nbsp; El gobierno de Luis Felipe&nbsp; establecio una&nbsp; honda&nbsp; separacion entre los delitos comunes y los politicos, siendo estos sometidos a una penalidad mas suave y sus autores exceptuados de la extradicion.&nbsp; Irradiando a&nbsp; otros&nbsp; paises tuvieron&nbsp; estas&nbsp; tan&nbsp; gran&nbsp; difusion que&nbsp; en&nbsp; casi todos&nbsp; los de regimen liberal-individualista se ha llegado&nbsp; a crear un tratamiento desprovisto&nbsp; de severidad para la represi6n&nbsp; de estos hechos.&nbsp;&nbsp; No solo las penas con que se conminaron perdieron gran parte de su antigua&nbsp; dureza, sino que en algunos paises se cre6 un regimen penal mas suave para estos delicuentes, en otros se abolio para ellos la pena de muerte.&nbsp; Tan profundo&nbsp; contraste entre el antiguo y el actual tratamiento de la criminalidad politica en la mayoria de los paises solo puede ser explicado por las ideas&nbsp; nacidas y difundiclas bajo los regimenes politicos liberales acerca de estos delitos y&nbsp; delincuentes.&nbsp; Por una parte se ha afirmado que la&nbsp; criminalidad de estos hechos no contiene la misma inmoralidad que la delincuencia comun, que es tan solo relativa, que depende del&nbsp; tiempo, del lugar,&nbsp; de las circumstancias, de las instituciones del pais.&nbsp; Otros invocan la&nbsp; elevacion de los moviles&nbsp; y sentimientos determinantes de estos hechos, el amor a la patria, la adhesion ferviente a determinadas&nbsp; ideas o principios, el espiritu de sacrifkio por el triunfo de un ideal.</p><p>"Contra su&nbsp; trato benevolo, del que no pocas veces se han&nbsp; beneficiado peligrosos&nbsp; malhechores, se ha iniciado hace algun tiempo una fuerte reaccidn (vease Cap.&nbsp; XV, 3.", b), que Uego a alcanzar considerable severidad en las Iegislaciones de tipo&nbsp; autoritario,&nbsp; y&nbsp; que tambien ha hallado eco, en forma mas suave, en las de otros paises de constitucion democratica en los que, especiahnente en los ultimos anos, la&nbsp; frecuehcia de agitaciones politicas y&nbsp; sociales ha originado la publicacion&nbsp; de numerosas leyes encaminadas a la proteccidn penal del Estado."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cuello Calon,&nbsp; Derecho Penal, Tomo 1, pp. 250-252.)</p><p>Such&nbsp; evils as may result from the failure of the policy of the&nbsp; law&nbsp; punishing&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense&nbsp; to&nbsp; dovetail&nbsp; with&nbsp; the policy of&nbsp; the law enforcing agencies in the apprehension and prosecution of the offenders are matters which may be brought to&nbsp; the attention of the departments&nbsp; concerned. The&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; branch can not amend the former in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; suit&nbsp; the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court cannot indulge in judicial legislation without violating the principle of&nbsp; separation of powers, and, hence, undermining the foundation of our republican system.&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, we cannot accept&nbsp; the theory of the prosecution without causing much bigger&nbsp; harm than that which would allegedly result from the adoption of the opposite view.</p><p>In&nbsp; conclusion, we hold that, under the allegations of the amended information against defendant-appellant Amado V. Hernandez, the murders, arsons end robberies described therein are mere ingredients of the crime of rebellion allegedly committed by said defendants, as means "necessary" (4) for&nbsp; the perpetration of said offense of rebellion;&nbsp; that the crime&nbsp; charged in the aforementioned amended information is,&nbsp; therefore, simple&nbsp; rebellion,&nbsp; not&nbsp; the&nbsp; complex crime of rebellion with multiple murder, arsons and&nbsp; robberies; that the&nbsp; maximum penalty imposable under such charge cannot exceed twelve (12) years of prisidn mayor and a fine of P20,000;&nbsp; and that, in conformity with the policy of&nbsp; this&nbsp; court&nbsp; in dealing&nbsp; with&nbsp; accused persons amenable to&nbsp; a similar&nbsp; punishment, said defendant&nbsp; may may be allowed bail.</p><p>It is urged that,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; its discretion, the Court should deny the motion under consideration, because the security of the State so requires, and because the judgment of conviction appealed from indicates that the evidence of guilt of Amado&nbsp; V.&nbsp; Hernandez is strong.&nbsp; However, as held in a&nbsp; resolution of this&nbsp; court, dated&nbsp; January 29, 1953,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; Montano <em>vs.</em> Ocampo&nbsp; (G. R. L-6352):&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* *&nbsp; * to&nbsp; deny bail it is not enough that the evidence of&nbsp; guilt is&nbsp; strong; it must also appear that&nbsp; in case of conviction the defendant's criminal liability would probably call for a capital punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; No clear or conclusive showing before this Court has&nbsp; been made."</p></blockquote><p>In fact,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case at bar, defendant Amado&nbsp; V. Hernandez was sentenced by the&nbsp; lower court, not to the extreme penalty, but&nbsp; to life imprisonment.&nbsp; Furthermore, individual freedom is too basic, too transcendental and vital in a republican state, like ours,&nbsp; to be denied upon mere general&nbsp; principles&nbsp; and&nbsp; abstract consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; public safety.&nbsp; Indeed, the&nbsp; preservation of liberty is such a major preoccupation of our political system that, not&nbsp; satisfied with guaranteeing its enjoyment in the very first paragraph of&nbsp; section&nbsp; (1) of the Bill of Rights, the framers of our Constitution devoted paragraphs (3), (4),&nbsp; (5),&nbsp; (6), (7), (8), (11), (12), (13),&nbsp; (14), (15), (16),&nbsp; (17), (18), and (21) of said&nbsp; section&nbsp; (1) to the protection&nbsp; of several aspects of freedom.&nbsp; Thus, in&nbsp; line with the&nbsp; letter and&nbsp; spirit of&nbsp; the fundamental&nbsp; law, we said&nbsp; in&nbsp; the aforementioned case of Montano <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Ocampo:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Exclusion from bail in capital offenses being an exception to the otherwise absolute right guaranteed&nbsp; by the constitution, the natural tendency of the courts has&nbsp; been toward a fair and liberal appreciation, rather than otherwise, of the evidence in the&nbsp; determination of the&nbsp; degree&nbsp; of proof and presumption of guilt necessary to warrant a deprivation&nbsp; of that&nbsp; right."&nbsp; </p><p>"In the evaluation of the evidence the probability of flight is one other important factor to be&nbsp; taken into account.&nbsp; The sole purpose of confining accused in jail before conviction, it has been observed, is to assure his presence at the trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, if denial of bail is authorized in capital cases, it&nbsp; is only&nbsp; on the&nbsp; theory that the&nbsp; proof being strong, the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; would&nbsp; flee,&nbsp; if&nbsp; he has the opportunity, rather than face the verdict of the jury.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the exception to the fundamental right to&nbsp; be bailed should be applied in direct ratio to the extent&nbsp; of the probability of evasion of prosecution.&nbsp; </p><p>"The possibility of escape&nbsp; in this case, bearing in mind the defendant's official and social standing and his other personal circumstances,&nbsp; seems remote if not nil."</p></blockquote><p>This view applies fully to Amado V. Hernandez, with the particularity that there is an&nbsp; additional circumstance&nbsp; in his&nbsp; favorâ€”he has been detained since January 1951, or for more than five&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; years, and it may still take&nbsp; some time to&nbsp; dispose of the case, for the same has not been,&nbsp; and is not in a position to be, included, as yet, in our calendar, in-asmuch&nbsp; as the briefs for some appellantsâ€”other than Hernandezâ€”as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; brief for the&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; are pending submission.&nbsp; It&nbsp; should be noted,&nbsp; also, that the decision appealed from&nbsp; the&nbsp; opposition to&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; in question do not reveal satisfactorily and&nbsp; concrete, positive act of the accused showing, sufficiently,&nbsp; that his provincial .release, during the pendency of the appeal, would jeopardize the security of the State.</p><p>Wherefore, the aforementioned motion for bail of defendant-appellant Amado V. Hernandez is hereby granted and,&nbsp; upon the filing of a bond, with sufficient sureties, in the sum of F30,000, and its approval by the court, let said defendant-appellant be&nbsp; provisionally released.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is&nbsp; 13&nbsp; so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.

When the information charges a&nbsp; capital offense the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; is not&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; bail&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; his guilt&nbsp; is strong.&nbsp; Of course&nbsp; this means before&nbsp; conviction.

can be&nbsp; no&nbsp; complex crime of rebellion with multiple&nbsp; murder, robbery,&nbsp; arson,&nbsp; etc., but that these crimes when committed during and on the occasion of a rebellion, are absorbed&nbsp;

it my duty not&nbsp; only to voice my dissent but also to state the reasons in support&nbsp; thereof.</p><p>The resolution cites and&nbsp; quotes Article&nbsp; 135&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code to support its theory that the five acts enumerated therein particularly those of engaging in war against the forces&nbsp; of the&nbsp; government,&nbsp; destroying property and committing serious violence,&nbsp; cover all the murders, robberies, arsons, etc., committed on the occasion of or&nbsp; during a rebellion;&nbsp; and&nbsp; it proceeds to&nbsp; assert that the expressions used in&nbsp; said article, such&nbsp; as engaging in war against&nbsp; the&nbsp; forces of the government and&nbsp; committing serious violence imply everything&nbsp; that war connotes such&nbsp; as physical injuries&nbsp; and loss of life.&nbsp; In this connection, it is of profit and even necessary&nbsp; to refer to Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code defining&nbsp; and describing how the crime of rebellion is committed.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Art. 134. <em>Rebellion or insurrectionâ€”How committed.</em>â€”The crime of rebellion&nbsp; or insurrection is committed by rising&nbsp;

part&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; of any&nbsp; body of land,&nbsp; naval&nbsp; or other&nbsp; armed&nbsp; forces,&nbsp; or of&nbsp; depriving the&nbsp; Chief Executive or the Legislature, wholly or partially, of any of their powers&nbsp; or&nbsp; prerogatives."</p></blockquote><p>According&nbsp; to.the above article, rebellion is&nbsp; committed by rising publicly&nbsp; and taking arms&nbsp; against the government&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose or&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; enumerated&nbsp; in said article.&nbsp; In other words, the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of rebellion is complete and consummated if&nbsp; a group of&nbsp; persons for the purposes&nbsp; enumerated in the&nbsp; article,&nbsp; rise&nbsp; publicly,&nbsp; take up arms and assemble.&nbsp; It is not necessary for&nbsp; its consummation&nbsp; that anybody&nbsp; be&nbsp; injured or killed,&nbsp; be&nbsp; it&nbsp; a government soldier&nbsp; or civilian, or&nbsp; that&nbsp; innocent&nbsp; persons be forcibly&nbsp; deprived of their properties by&nbsp; means of robbery or that their stores and houses&nbsp; be&nbsp; looted and&nbsp; then burned to the&nbsp; ground.&nbsp; Stated differently,&nbsp; murders, robberies, arsons,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; are not necessary or&nbsp; indispensable in the commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; rebellion and,&nbsp; consequently,&nbsp; are&nbsp; not ingredients&nbsp; or elements of the latter.</p><p>Article 48 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code&nbsp; providing for "Penalty for complex crimes" reads thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"ART. 48. <em>Penalty for complex crimes.</em>â€”When a single&nbsp; act constitutes two&nbsp; or more&nbsp; grave or less grave felonies,&nbsp; or&nbsp; when an offense is&nbsp; a necessary means for committing the other, the penalty for the most&nbsp; serious crime shall be imposed, the same&nbsp; to be applied in its maximum&nbsp; period."&nbsp; (As&nbsp; amended by Act No.&nbsp; 4000.)</p></blockquote><p>For better understanding, I deem&nbsp; it advisable to ascertain&nbsp; and explain the meaning of&nbsp; the phrase&nbsp; "necessary means" used&nbsp; in Article 48.&nbsp; "Necessary&nbsp; means" as interpreted&nbsp; by criminologists, jurists&nbsp; and&nbsp; legal commentators, does not&nbsp; mean indispensable means, because&nbsp; if&nbsp; it did,&nbsp; then the offense as a&nbsp; "necessary means" to&nbsp; commit another would be an indispensable&nbsp; element of the latter and would be an ingredient thereof.&nbsp; That&nbsp; would&nbsp; be true in the offense&nbsp; of trespass to dwelling to commit&nbsp; robbery in an inhabited house,&nbsp; or the infliction of physical injuries to commit homicide&nbsp; or murder.&nbsp; The phrase "necessary means"&nbsp; used in Article&nbsp; 48,&nbsp; merely signifies that for instanse, a crime such&nbsp; as simple estafa&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; and ordinarily&nbsp; is&nbsp; committed in&nbsp; the manner&nbsp; defined&nbsp; and described in the&nbsp; Penal Code;&nbsp; but, if the "estafador" resorts to or employs&nbsp; falsification, merely&nbsp; to facilitate&nbsp; and insure his committing the estafa, then he is guilty of the complex crime of&nbsp; estafa thru&nbsp; falsification.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if one desiring to&nbsp; rape a certain woman, instead&nbsp; of waiting for an opportunity where she&nbsp; could&nbsp; be alone&nbsp; or helpless, in the&nbsp; fields&nbsp; or some&nbsp; isolated place,&nbsp; abducts&nbsp; her&nbsp; by&nbsp; force and takes her to a forest&nbsp; to ravish her;&nbsp; or&nbsp; he&nbsp; enters her&nbsp; home&nbsp; through a window at night and rapes her in' her&nbsp; room, then&nbsp; he is guilty of the complex crime&nbsp; of abduction with&nbsp; rape&nbsp; or&nbsp; rape&nbsp; with&nbsp; tresspass&nbsp; to&nbsp; dwelling. The reason is that the&nbsp; commission of abduction of tress pass&nbsp; to dwelling&nbsp; are not indispensable&nbsp; means&nbsp; or&nbsp; ingredients&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime of rape.&nbsp; They&nbsp; are but means selected by the&nbsp; culprit to facilitate&nbsp; and carry&nbsp; out perhaps more&nbsp; quickly&nbsp; his evil.&nbsp; designs on&nbsp; his victim.&nbsp;&nbsp; Says the eminent&nbsp; Spanish&nbsp; commentator,&nbsp; Groizard, on this&nbsp; point:</p><p>"Una cosa anologa acontece respecto&nbsp; de los delitos conexionados con una relacidn de medio a fin.&nbsp; Tambien en ellos la unklad de acto moral, que da vida&nbsp; al delito,&nbsp; hace logica la&nbsp; imposicion de una&nbsp; sola&nbsp; pena* Preciso es, sin embargo,&nbsp; distinguir el&nbsp; caso en que el delito medio&nbsp; sea medio necesario&nbsp; de realizar el delito fin, del caso en que&nbsp; sea puramente medio, pero no medio indispensable. En aquel,&nbsp; el delito&nbsp; medio&nbsp; no es,&nbsp; en&nbsp; realidad, sino&nbsp; una condicion precisa, una circumstancia&nbsp; sine&nbsp; qua non, un&nbsp; elemento&nbsp; integral de la accion&nbsp; punible. concebida&nbsp; como fin.&nbsp; Sin pasar por uno, seria imposible&nbsp; llegar al&nbsp; otro.&nbsp;&nbsp; La voluntad, libre&nbsp; e&nbsp; inteligente, tiene entonces por unico objeto&nbsp; llegar al delito&nbsp; fin.&nbsp; Si&nbsp; al recorrer su camino&nbsp; ha&nbsp; de pasar, indispensablemente, por la&nbsp; comisi6n&nbsp; de otro hecho&nbsp; punible, no&nbsp; dos, sino un delito&nbsp; habra que&nbsp; castigar,&nbsp; toda vez que uno&nbsp; fue&nbsp; el mal Kbremente&nbsp; querido, no siendolo&nbsp; el otro por si, sino en tanto que era necesario para obtener la realizaciqn del mal proposito concebido."</p><p align="center">* * *</p><p>"Asi, hay que reconocer que es plausible que,&nbsp; cuando un delitoes medio&nbsp; de realizar otro,&nbsp; se imponga&nbsp; al culpable la pena&nbsp; correspondiente al mayor en su grado&nbsp; maximo;&nbsp; pero que no los es&nbsp; si resulta que ha&nbsp; sido medio necesario.&nbsp;&nbsp; Por lo contrario, para que sea justo el aumento&nbsp; de pena,&nbsp; con&nbsp; arreglo a la, doctrina general acerca del delito y las&nbsp; circunstancia agravantes, es preciso que existan y no&nbsp; se aprovechen otros procedimientos, otros recursos, mas&nbsp; o menos faciles para consumar el delito.&nbsp; Entonces la responsibilidad se hace mayor eligiendo un medio que sea un delito en si.&nbsp; El que puede, haciendo&nbsp; uso de&nbsp; su libertad y&nbsp; de&nbsp; su&nbsp; inteligencia, escoger entre varios procedimientos&nbsp; para llegar a&nbsp; un&nbsp; fin,&nbsp; y se&nbsp; decide por uno que por&nbsp; si solo&nbsp; constituye delito,&nbsp; de este&nbsp; delito&nbsp; no necessario para la realizacidn del&nbsp; proyectado como fin, debe responder tambien."</p><p align="center">* * *</p><blockquote><p>"Ejemplo:&nbsp; el allanamiento de&nbsp; domicilio como&nbsp; medio&nbsp; de Hegar al delito&nbsp; de&nbsp; violacidn.

In another case, a&nbsp; passenger bus containing&nbsp; about forty civilian passengers&nbsp; in Sta.&nbsp; Cruz, Zambales, was held up by&nbsp; these armed dissidents;&nbsp; the passengers were robbed of their money and jewelry and fourteen of them were shot to death.&nbsp; The party of Mrs. Aurora&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; while on its&nbsp; way&nbsp; to the town of Baler, was ambushed in Bongabong,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija&nbsp; by&nbsp; the dissidents&nbsp; and&nbsp; several members of&nbsp; the party,&nbsp; including herself, her&nbsp; daughter, her son-in-law,&nbsp; Mayor&nbsp; Bernardo of&nbsp; Quezon City,&nbsp; and others were killed,&nbsp; and their persons despoiled&nbsp; of jewelries and belongings.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; clear that all these&nbsp; acts of murder, vandalism,&nbsp; banditry and pillage&nbsp; cannot be regarded as ingredients1 and indispensable elements of the crime&nbsp; of rebellion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The aforecited acts&nbsp; and cases, the enumeration of which is far from complete, are not based on mere suspicion or hearsay.&nbsp; They are&nbsp; alleged as facts in the&nbsp; numerous counts contained in complaints or informations for rebellion with multiple&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; robbery, arson, kidnapping, etc.&nbsp; in several&nbsp; separate&nbsp; cases in the Courts of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance, some still pending&nbsp; trial but quite a number already&nbsp; decided and now pending appeal before us.&nbsp;&nbsp; There must&nbsp; be much truth to these&nbsp; charges and&nbsp; counts&nbsp; because in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; against&nbsp; Huk&nbsp; Supremo Luis Taruc, William&nbsp; Pomeroy et al.,&nbsp; (criminal case No. 19166&nbsp; C.F.I., Manila)&nbsp; Pomeroy&nbsp; pleaded guilty to all the thirty&nbsp; counts against him; so&nbsp; did Taruc&nbsp;&nbsp; after seven counts had been eliminated from the thirty&nbsp; contained in the information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the&nbsp; twenty three counts remaining to which Taruc pleaded guilty were&nbsp; the&nbsp; holding up&nbsp; of forty civilians&nbsp; in a passenger bus in Sta. Cruz,&nbsp; Zambales,&nbsp; and the night raid on Camp Macabulos where hospital&nbsp; patients and a Red Cross nurse were killed. </p><p>Since&nbsp; the&nbsp; above mentioned crimes&nbsp; of multiple&nbsp; murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc., are not ingredients of rebellion nor&nbsp; indispensable to&nbsp; its commission&nbsp; but&nbsp; only means&nbsp; selected and employed by&nbsp; the offenders to commit&nbsp; rebellion&nbsp; and&nbsp; achieve their&nbsp; goal, a complex crime is committed under Article&nbsp; 48 of the Revised Penal Code.</p><p>Going back&nbsp; to the&nbsp; theory of the majority&nbsp; in the&nbsp; resolution that the phrase engaging in&nbsp; war&nbsp; and committing serious violence used&nbsp; in Article 134, covers the crimes of murder, robbery, arson, etc., committed&nbsp; during a&nbsp; rebellion,&nbsp; I&nbsp; emphatically disagree.&nbsp; Engaging&nbsp; in war&nbsp; and levying war, against the government, are general&nbsp; terms employed in the United States statutes to&nbsp; define&nbsp; rebellion and&nbsp; treason.&nbsp; They are used interchangeably&nbsp; and&nbsp; have the same&nbsp; meaning&nbsp; in our&nbsp; law on rebellion&nbsp; and&nbsp; treason, (Articles 114, 134, 135, Revised Penal Code) which are&nbsp; based on Act 292 of&nbsp; American origin.&nbsp; They do&nbsp; not&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; mean&nbsp; actual&nbsp; killing of government&nbsp; troops, much less&nbsp; of innocent civilians.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>Levying&nbsp; War</em>.â€”The&nbsp; assembling&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; body&nbsp; of&nbsp; men for&nbsp; the purpose of&nbsp; effecting&nbsp; by force a treasonable object; and all who perform any part, however, minute,&nbsp; or however remote&nbsp; from the scene of&nbsp; action, and who are&nbsp; leagued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the general conspiracy, are considered as engaged in levying war, within the meaning of the constitution."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Vol. 2,&nbsp; p. 1938.)</p></blockquote><p>This Tribunal&nbsp; defines "levying war"&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of U. S. <em>vs.</em> Lagnason, 3 Phil., 478-9, thus: </p><blockquote><p>"Whatever&nbsp; differences&nbsp; there&nbsp; may&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; among&nbsp; the early judges as to whether an armed resistance to the&nbsp; enforcement of a public law (see Act No. 292, section&nbsp; 5, 1)&nbsp; constituted&nbsp; a levying of war or&nbsp; not,&nbsp; and&nbsp; was or was not treason,&nbsp; yet&nbsp; they were all&nbsp; unanimous&nbsp; in&nbsp; holding that acts&nbsp; of violence&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by an&nbsp; armed body of men with the purpose of overthrowing the Governmerit was "levying war&nbsp; against the United States,"&nbsp; and was therefore treason, whether it was done by ten men or ten thousand. (See United States <em>vs.</em> Han way, 2 Wall., jr., 139; 26 Fed. Cases, 105.)</p></blockquote><p align="center">* * *</p><blockquote><p>"As the act&nbsp; of, engaging in a rebellion&nbsp; is levying&nbsp; war, and therefore&nbsp; treason, the same act seems to be punished by&nbsp; both sections and&nbsp; in&nbsp; different&nbsp; ways."&nbsp; (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Lagnason, 3 Phil., 46-9)</p></blockquote><p>Just as&nbsp; a citizen can commit treason by adhering to the enemy and&nbsp; committing&nbsp; treasonable&nbsp; overt acts such as pointing out and helping arrest guerrillas,&nbsp; accompanying enemy soldiers on patrol and giving valuable information to&nbsp; the enemy,&nbsp; without himself killing anyone of his countrymen, this although Article 114 uses the phrase levying war to define treason,&nbsp; so,&nbsp; although&nbsp; Article 135 iises&nbsp; the&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; "engaging&nbsp; in&nbsp; war",&nbsp; a group&nbsp; of individuals may also commit rebellion by merely rising publicly and taking arms against the government&nbsp; without firing a single shot or inflicting a single wound.</p><p>But the majority says that serious violence mentioned in&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 134 may include murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, this view is untenable.&nbsp; From&nbsp; serious violence to the capital&nbsp; offense of&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; certainly, is&nbsp; a&nbsp; far cry.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; serious violence can&nbsp; also be on things.&nbsp; In my opinion, the different&nbsp; acts mentioned in&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 135,&nbsp;&nbsp; among them, destroying property, committing serious violence,&nbsp; exacting contributions or diverting public funds, instead of giving license and unlimited leave to rebels and dissidents to engage in mass murder, looting and wholesale destruction of property, on the contrary, serve to limit and restrict the violations&nbsp; of law that may be included&nbsp; in&nbsp; and absorbed by rebellion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Article 135 mentions those acts which generally accompany a public armed uprising.&nbsp;&nbsp; When rebels raid a town or barrio,&nbsp; manhandling of civilians&nbsp; who obstruct their movements or fail&nbsp; to carry out their orders such as to lend their carabaos and carts for transportation purposes, or to contribute food, clothes, medicines, money etc., may be expected.&nbsp; The&nbsp; rebels may employ force to disarm the policeman guarding the Presidencia&nbsp; and if he offers resistance beat him up or, once inside, break down the door&nbsp; of&nbsp; the treasurer's office, blow&nbsp; up his safe and carry away&nbsp; the money contents thereof.&nbsp; All&nbsp; these acts involve&nbsp; violence,&nbsp; even serious violence&nbsp; on persons and things, including diversion of public funds.&nbsp; But knowing that these law violations, relatively not serious,&nbsp; are generally unavoidable&nbsp; in public&nbsp; armed&nbsp; uprisings&nbsp; involving hastily assembled&nbsp; persons and groups&nbsp; with little&nbsp; discipline' the law tolerates&nbsp; them, considering them as part of&nbsp; the rebellion.&nbsp; But when rebels rob innocent civilians, kidnap them for purposes&nbsp; of ransom,&nbsp; even kill them merely because they fail&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the&nbsp; ransom, and civilian houses are put to the torch, endangering the lives of the inmates; when civilians&nbsp; are killed for refusing to&nbsp; contribute, or on mere suspicion of their giving information to the&nbsp; government, I cannot believe that these brutal&nbsp; act are condoned by the law and are to be included in the crime of rebellion.</p><p>The majority leans heavily&nbsp; on our decisions in several treason&nbsp; cases wherein we refused&nbsp; or failed to&nbsp; convict of the complex&nbsp; crime of treason with multiple murder.&nbsp; To me, those cases are neither controlling nor applicable&nbsp; for several reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost invariably,&nbsp; indictment in&nbsp; those treason&nbsp; cases alleged the killings committed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; indictees as ingredients and elements of treason.&nbsp;&nbsp; They&nbsp; are mentioned as the overt acts to&nbsp; establish and prove treason. Naturally, the court held that being ingredients of&nbsp; the crime of&nbsp; treason&nbsp; they cannot be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; distinct and separate offenses for the purpose of applying Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Another reason is that, treason being a capital offense, this court did not see any immediate necessity for&nbsp; considering&nbsp; and&nbsp; applying&nbsp; the theory of complex&nbsp; crime because the result would in many cases be&nbsp; practically&nbsp; the same. In other words,&nbsp; treason might yet be said to absjorb the crime of homicide, even of murder, because as&nbsp; regards the penalty, they are of the same category.&nbsp; Still another reason, not an unimportant one is that at that time, opinion among the members of this Tribunal on the question of complex crime of treason with&nbsp; homicide,&nbsp; sedition with&nbsp; murder and&nbsp; rebellion with murder,&nbsp; arson,&nbsp; robbery, etc., had not yet crystalized, one way or the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we preferred to avoid ruling on the issue,&nbsp; specially since&nbsp; by considering the&nbsp; commission of murder, robbery, etc.,&nbsp; in treason as aggravating the crime, we&nbsp; would achieve the same result&nbsp; as regards the penalty to&nbsp; be imposed.</p><p>But in the case of People <em>vs.</em> Perfecto Labra, G. R. No. 1240, May 12, 1949, this court&nbsp; through Mr.&nbsp; Justice Bengzon, accepted the view of the Solicitor General that under Article 48&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code, Labra was guilty of the complex crime of treason with murder, as shown by the dispositive part of our decision in that case, which is quoted below:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Wherefore, the verdict of&nbsp; guilt&nbsp; must be&nbsp; affirmed. Article 48, 114 and 248 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code are applicable to&nbsp; the offense of treason with murder.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; for lack&nbsp; of sufficient votes to impose the&nbsp; extreme penalty,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; sentenced to life imprisonment."</p></blockquote><p>The only reason why&nbsp; the&nbsp; death penalty was not imposed in said case was because&nbsp; of lack of sufficient votes but evidently, the Justices were agreed as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; application of Article 48 of the Penal Code regarding complex crimes.</p><p>Then in the treason case of People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Barrameda, 85 Phil., 789,&nbsp; 47 Off. Gaz., 5082, on the&nbsp; strength of our decision in the case of Labra, the Solicitor General recommended that tearrameda be also convicted&nbsp; of the complex crime&nbsp; of treason with multiple murder and sentenced to death.&nbsp; This&nbsp; Tribunal&nbsp; accepted the&nbsp; Solicitor&nbsp; General's recommendation and&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; the&nbsp; death penalty in the following language:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"We&nbsp; entertain not&nbsp; the least doubt as to&nbsp; the guilt of the appellant.&nbsp; His very counsel de&nbsp; oficio who made an&nbsp; analysis of the testimonies of the witnesses for the&nbsp; prosecution and painstakingly stated them&nbsp; in&nbsp; detail&nbsp; in his brief, agrees that his client is&nbsp; guilty although he prays&nbsp; that the sentence of life imprisonment&nbsp; be&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; The Solicitor General, however, recommends that the penalty of death be imposed upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp; that the treason committed by&nbsp; the appellant was accompanied not only by /the apprehension of Americans (U. S. citizens) and&nbsp; their&nbsp; delivery to the Japanese forces which evidently later executed them, h/ut also by killing with his own hands not only one but&nbsp; several y'Filipinos, his own&nbsp; countrymen, and that in addition to this, he took&nbsp; part&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; mass&nbsp; killing&nbsp; and&nbsp; slaughter&nbsp; of many&nbsp; other Filipinos, we are constrained to&nbsp; agree to said recommendation. However, unpleasant,&nbsp; even&nbsp; painful is the compliance&nbsp; with our duty,&nbsp; we hereby impose upon&nbsp; the appellant&nbsp; Teodoro&nbsp; Barrameda the penalty of&nbsp; death which will&nbsp; be carried out&nbsp; on&nbsp; a day to be fixed by the trial court within thirty (30) days after the&nbsp; return of the record&nbsp; of the case to said&nbsp; court."</p></blockquote><p>With the two&nbsp; aforecited cases, it may not be said that the Supreme Court has always held that there can be&nbsp; no complex&nbsp; crime of treason&nbsp; with murder.</p><p>The theory of the majority is that the crime of rebellion with the&nbsp; maximum penalty&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; twelve&nbsp; years&nbsp; and fine, absorbs the other crimes of murder,&nbsp; robbery, arson, kidnapping, etc.,&nbsp; as long as the&nbsp; latter are committed in the course&nbsp; and&nbsp; in furtherance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; former.&nbsp; The&nbsp; idea&nbsp; of one&nbsp; crime absorbing a&nbsp; more serious one with&nbsp; a&nbsp; more severe&nbsp; penalty does not&nbsp; readily appeal to the reasonable and&nbsp; logical mind&nbsp; which&nbsp; can only&nbsp; comprehend&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; thing absorbing another smaller&nbsp; or less than itself in&nbsp; volume, in importance, in value or in category.&nbsp; That is why Judge Montesa in the three cases, People <em>vs.</em> Hernandez, People <em>vs.</em> Espiritu, and&nbsp; People <em>vs.</em> Medina, criminal cases Nos. 15481,&nbsp; 15479 and 1411 respectively, of the Court of First Instance,&nbsp; Manila, in his decision&nbsp; convicting the&nbsp; accused therein, in disposing of the theory&nbsp; of absorption,&nbsp; urged upon him&nbsp; by counsel for the defense to the effect that the crime of rebellion&nbsp; absorbs the crime&nbsp; of murder,&nbsp; robbery, arson,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; made the&nbsp; following observations:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The theory of absorption tenaciously adhered to by the defense to the effect that rebellion absorbs all these moire serious offenses is preposterous to&nbsp; say the least, considering that it is both physically and metaphysically imposible for a smaller unit or entity to absorb a bigger one."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Montesa, J., People <em>vs.</em> Hernandez G. R. No. 15481, p. 78.)</p></blockquote><p>We need&nbsp; not go into an&nbsp; academic&nbsp; discussion&nbsp; of&nbsp; this , question because as a matter of law,&nbsp; my opinion, criminal jurisprudence, expounding the criminal law namely the Penal Code&nbsp; and the Penal&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Spain, on which it&nbsp; is based, expressly and clearly declare that the common crimes of murder, robbery,&nbsp; arson, etc.,&nbsp; committed in the course or by reason&nbsp; of rebellion, are&nbsp; separate crimes,&nbsp; not to be merged in or absorbed by rebellion and should be prosecuted separately.&nbsp; Article 259 of the Penal&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of&nbsp; Spain,&nbsp; of 1870&nbsp; on which our Penal Code promulgated in 1887,&nbsp; was based, provides as follow:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Los delitos&nbsp; particulares cometidos&nbsp; en una rebellion o&nbsp; sedicion 6 con&nbsp; motivo&nbsp; de ellas, serin castigados&nbsp; respectivamente, segun fefek disposiciones de este Codigo.</p><p>"Cuando no puedan descubrirse sus&nbsp; autores, ser&amp;a penados&nbsp; como tales Ios&nbsp; jefes principales&nbsp; de&nbsp; la rebelion 6&nbsp; sedicion."&nbsp; (Groizaixl, El Codigo Penal de 1870,&nbsp; Tomo III,&nbsp; Articulo 259, p.&nbsp; 649.)</p></blockquote><p>In commenting on Article 259 of the Spanish Penal Code, Viada says:</p><blockquote><p>" 'La disposicion del primer parrafo&nbsp; de este articulo no puede ser mas justa;&nbsp; con&nbsp; arreglo&nbsp; a ella, Ios&nbsp; delitos particulares&nbsp; o comunes cometidos en una rebellion o sedicion no&nbsp; deberan&nbsp; reputarse como accidentes inherentes a estas, sino como delitos&nbsp; especiales&nbsp; a dicha rebellion y&nbsp; sedicion&nbsp; ajenos, Ios que&nbsp; deberan ser&nbsp; respectivamente castigados con las penas que en este&nbsp; Codigo se. les senalan.&nbsp; Pero que delitos deber&amp;n considerarse como comunes, y cualles como constitutivos de la propia rebelion o&nbsp; sedicion?&nbsp; En cuanto a&nbsp; la rebeli6n, no ofrece este cuestion dificultad alguna, pues todo hecho que no este comprendido en uno u otro de&nbsp; Ios objetos especificados en Ios seis ntimeros del Articulo 243&nbsp; sera&nbsp; extraiio&nbsp; a la rebelion,&nbsp; y si&nbsp; se. hallere definido&nbsp; en algun otro&nbsp; articulo&nbsp; del&nbsp; Codigo, con arreglo&nbsp; a este debera&nbsp; ser castigado como delito particular' "&nbsp;&nbsp; (Viada, Codigo Penal, Tomo II, 198-199.)</p></blockquote><p>Pena, another commentator, referring to Article 259 of the Spanish&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; has the following to say:</p><blockquote><p>"La&nbsp; disposicion de este articulo es sobradamente justa, pero cuando se entendera&nbsp; que el&nbsp; hecho es&nbsp; independiente de la insurgencia?&nbsp; </p><p>Tratandose de la rebelion no hay problema, pues todos los fines que se indican en el Articulo 214 se distinguen facilmente de uri asesinato, un&nbsp; robo,&nbsp; una&nbsp; violacidn,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; El&nbsp; problema&nbsp; puede&nbsp; surgir&nbsp; con&nbsp; la sedicion, en cuyos tres ultimos numeros, dice un autor,&nbsp; se tipifican conductas que&nbsp; muy bien pueden&nbsp; ser subsimidas en&nbsp; otros&nbsp; lugares del Codigo.&nbsp;&nbsp; El T.S. parece que&nbsp; sigue&nbsp; este principio general:&nbsp; las infracciones graves&nbsp; se considerdn como delitos independientes, en cambio&nbsp; los hechos de menor gravedad puedan ser considerados como accidentes de&nbsp; la&nbsp; rebelion.&nbsp; En este sentido, el T. S. ha declarado que&nbsp; son accidentes&nbsp; de la rebelion,&nbsp; los&nbsp; desacatos y&nbsp; lesiones a&nbsp; la autoridad y otros delitos contra el orden publieo, asi&nbsp; como la&nbsp; resistencia o acometiendo a la fuerza publica (23 Mayo 1890). El&nbsp; abuso de&nbsp; superioridad&nbsp; tambien&nbsp; es&nbsp; inherente&nbsp; el&nbsp; alzamiento&nbsp; tumultuario (19 noviembre 1906.)"&nbsp; (Peixa Deredes&nbsp; Penal, Tomo&nbsp; II pp. 89-90.)</p></blockquote><p>Another&nbsp; commentator, A.&nbsp; Quintano&nbsp; Ripolles, says&nbsp; of Article 259 of the Spanish&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; counterpart of Article 244 of&nbsp; our old&nbsp; Penal Code:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"La concurrencia de delitos consignada en este articulo no puede ser mds justa, bien que la dificultad persista siempre para determinar&nbsp; cuales han de&nbsp; ser los&nbsp; particulares accidentales y cuales los integrantes de la propia subversion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Una&nbsp; doctrina demasiado simplista,&nbsp; que ha sido a&nbsp; menudo seguida por&nbsp; la Jurisprudencia,&nbsp; es&nbsp; la de estimar que, absorbiendo el delUo&nbsp; mds grave al que lo es menos, todo el&nbsp; que por debajo del'de rebelion o sedicion sera anulado por este.&nbsp; Para&nbsp; los de la&nbsp; misma&nbsp; naturaleza, la cosa es&nbsp; iricuestionable, pero no para los que la tengan diversa,&nbsp; entendiendo por la estrana e imprecisa expresion de (particulares)&nbsp; a las infracciones comunes o no politicas.",&nbsp; (A. Quintano Ripolles, Comentarios al Codigo&nbsp; Penal Vol. II, pp.&nbsp; 101-102;&nbsp; cursivas con nuestras.)</p></blockquote><p>Another&nbsp; distinguished legal commentator gives his&nbsp; view on the same Article 259:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Se establece&nbsp; aqui que en una&nbsp; rebelion o sedicion, o&nbsp; con motivo de ellas, comente otros delitos&nbsp; (v. g., roba, mata o&nbsp; lesioha), seca responsable de estos ademas de los delitos de rebelion o sedicion.&nbsp; La dificultad consiste en&nbsp; estos casos&nbsp; en separar los accidentes&nbsp; de&nbsp; la rebelion o sedicion de los delitos&nbsp; independientes de&nbsp; estas,&nbsp; y como las leyes&nbsp; no&nbsp; contienen en&nbsp; este punto precepto&nbsp; alguno aplicable,&nbsp; su solucion ha quedado encomendada a los tribunales.&nbsp;&nbsp; La jurisprudencia&nbsp; que&nbsp; estos han sentado&nbsp; considera&nbsp; como accidentes&nbsp; de&nbsp; la rebelion o sedicionâ€”cuya criminalidad&nbsp; queda&nbsp; embebida en&nbsp; la&nbsp; de estos delitos, y, por tanto,&nbsp; no son&nbsp; punibles especialmenteâ€”los hechos de escasa gravedad&nbsp; (v:g.,&nbsp; atentados,&nbsp; desacatos, lesiones&nbsp; menos graves); por el contrario, las infracciones graves, como el asesinato o las lesiones graves,&nbsp; se consideran como delitos&nbsp; independientes de la rebelion o de la sedicion."&nbsp; (Cuello Calon, Vol. 2 Derecho Penal p. 110.)</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Groizard, another&nbsp; eminent commentator of the Penal&nbsp; code of Spain, in commenting on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same Article 259 of the Spanish Penal Code of 1870,&nbsp; says the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"No necesita ninguno el parrafo primero de&nbsp; este articulo.&nbsp; Aunque no se hubiera escrito en el Codigo, harian los&nbsp; Tribunates lo que dice. Seria necesario para que asi no sucediera el que fuera la rebelion un motivo de exencion de responsabilidad criminal para las demas clases de delitos."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Groizard&nbsp; Tomo&nbsp; 3, 650.)</p></blockquote><p>It will be seen that Spanish jurists and legal commentators are, with reference&nbsp; to&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 259 of the&nbsp; Spanish Penal&nbsp; Code of 1870, unanimous in the opinion that this provision of the&nbsp; Criminal Law is just&nbsp; and fair because one should&nbsp; not take advantage of his committing the crime of rebellion by committing other more&nbsp; serious crime such as murder, robbery, arson, etc., with impunity.&nbsp; The above much&nbsp; commented Article&nbsp; 259 of the Spanish Penal Code has its counterpart in Article 244 of&nbsp; our&nbsp; old Penal Code in practically the&nbsp; same wording and&nbsp; phraseology:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Art. 24. AM other crimes committed in the&nbsp; course of a rebellion of seditious&nbsp; movement, or on&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; thereof, shall be punished in accordance with the rules of this Code.&nbsp; </p><p>"If&nbsp; the perpetrators of such crimes can&nbsp; not be discovered, the principal leaders of the rebellion&nbsp; or&nbsp; sedition shall be punished therefore as principals."</p></blockquote><p>In&nbsp; this jurisdiction,&nbsp; we have faithfully observed and applied this penal&nbsp; provision.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of U.&nbsp; S. <em>vs.</em> Cabrera, et al., 43&nbsp; Phil., page 64 and page 82 for sedition and multiple murder respectively, wherein members of the Philippine&nbsp; constabulary&nbsp; attacked and killed several&nbsp; policemen&nbsp; in&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court convicted&nbsp; said soldiers,&nbsp; first, of sedition and later, of&nbsp; multiple&nbsp; murder, clear proof that the murders committed in the course of and by reason of&nbsp; the sedition&nbsp; were not included in and absorbed by sedition, this despite the fact that&nbsp; our law on sedition then, section 5 of Act No. 292,, uses the Wordsâ€” rise publicly and tumultuously, in order to attain by force or outside&nbsp; of legal methods any of the&nbsp; following&nbsp; objects are&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of sedition.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; multiple&nbsp; murder case, the sergeants and corporals of the constabulary, who took part in the killing of&nbsp; the&nbsp; city&nbsp; policemen,&nbsp; were sentenced to death.&nbsp; This court in that&nbsp; case&nbsp; said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"It is merely stating the obvious to say that sedition is not the same offense as murder.&nbsp; Sedition is&nbsp; a crime against public order; murder&nbsp; is a&nbsp; crime against persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sedition&nbsp; is a&nbsp; crime&nbsp; directed against the existence&nbsp; of the State, the authority of the government, and the general public tranquility; murder is a crime directed against the&nbsp; lives&nbsp; of&nbsp; individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S. <em>vs.</em> Abad (1902)&nbsp; 1&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 437.) Sedition in its more general sense&nbsp; is the raising of&nbsp; commotions or disturbances in the&nbsp; state; murder at&nbsp; common law is where&nbsp; a person&nbsp; of&nbsp; sound mind and discretion unlawfully kills any human being, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sovereign, with&nbsp; malice&nbsp; aforethought, express&nbsp; or implied.&nbsp; </p><p>"The offenses charged in the two&nbsp; informations for&nbsp; sedition&nbsp; and murder are perfectly&nbsp; distinct&nbsp; in point of law, however, nearly they may&nbsp; be connected&nbsp; in point of&nbsp; fact.&nbsp; Not&nbsp; alone are&nbsp; the&nbsp; offenses "eo&nbsp; nomine" different, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations in the body of the informations are different.&nbsp; The gist of the&nbsp; information for&nbsp; sedition is the public and tumultuous&nbsp; uprising of the constabulary in&nbsp; order to attain by force and outside of&nbsp; legal methods the object of inflicting an act of&nbsp; hate and revenge upon the&nbsp; persons of the police&nbsp; force of the city of Manila by firing at them in several places in the city of Manila; the gist&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; information&nbsp; in the murder case&nbsp; is&nbsp; that the constabulary, conspiring together, illegally and criminally killed eight persons&nbsp; and&nbsp; gravely wounded&nbsp; three&nbsp; others.&nbsp; The&nbsp; crimes&nbsp; of murder and&nbsp; serious physical injuries&nbsp; were not&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; included in the information&nbsp; for sedition;&nbsp; and the defendants could not have been convicted of these crimes under&nbsp; the first information."&nbsp; (Phil. Vol.&nbsp; 43, pages 99-100.)</p></blockquote><p>There is an insinuation&nbsp; made in the majority resolution, that the&nbsp; American&nbsp; Law&nbsp; on&nbsp; sedition&nbsp; and rebellion,&nbsp; the origin of our present&nbsp; law on the subject,&nbsp; is more&nbsp; benign and&nbsp; liberal than its counterpart in the&nbsp; Spanish Penal Code, defining&nbsp; and&nbsp; penalizing sedition and rebellion,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that under&nbsp; American jurisprudence,&nbsp; rebellion and sedition&nbsp; include crimes like murder, robbery,&nbsp; arson,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; committed in the course thereof.&nbsp; But it will be noticed that of the nine Justices who signed the decision in the case of People <em>vs.</em> Cabrera for multiple murder, five, including Mr. Justice Malcolm, who penned the decision, were Americans, supposed to be steeped in American Law and the common law, and yet they all held that sedition where force is expected to be&nbsp; used, did&nbsp; not include murder.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; evident that the insinuation made&nbsp; in the majority resolution is not exactly borne out by the Cabrera case.</p><p>The majority&nbsp; asks why in the past,&nbsp; especially up&nbsp; to 1932,&nbsp; when our&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal Code&nbsp; was&nbsp; promulgated no one had&nbsp; ever been&nbsp; prosecuted, much&nbsp; less convicted&nbsp; of rebellion or sedition complexed with&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; robbery, etc., if it is true that there is&nbsp; such a complex crime of rebellion with murder.&nbsp; For that matter, one may even ask why the constabulary&nbsp; soldiers in the Cabrera case&nbsp; were not charged with the complex crime of sedition with murder. The&nbsp; reason and the answer are obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; Until&nbsp; 1932, the year of the promulgation of our Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, our old Penal Code included Article&nbsp; 244, the counterpart&nbsp; of Article 259 of the Spanish Penal Code, to the effect that common crimes&nbsp; like murder, robbery,&nbsp; arson, committed on the occasion or by reason of a rebellion or sedition, are to be&nbsp; prosecuted separately.&nbsp; That&nbsp; was&nbsp; why insurgents who committed rebellion or insurrection with homicide&nbsp; or murder during the first&nbsp; days of the American regime&nbsp; in the Philippines,&nbsp; could not&nbsp; be charged with the complex crime&nbsp; of rebellion with&nbsp; murder; and that explains why Cabrera and his co-accused could&nbsp; not be&nbsp; charged with the complex crime of sedition with&nbsp; multiple murder, but were prosecuted separately for multiple&nbsp; murder.</p><p>The majority also&nbsp; asks why the insurgents in the year 1901 and 1902 were charged only with rebellion&nbsp; but never with murder despite the fact that there was proof that they also had committed&nbsp; murder in the course of the rebellion or insurrection.&nbsp; The reason to my mind was that, shortly thereafter,&nbsp; came&nbsp; the&nbsp; proclamation&nbsp; of&nbsp; amnesty issued by President McKinley of the United States, which amnesty covered not&nbsp; only the crime of rebellion but also other violations of the law committed in the course of the rebellion.</p><p>Then came our Revised Penal Code promulgated in 1932. It is a revision&nbsp; of our old&nbsp; Penal Code of 1887.&nbsp; One of the purposes of the revision was simplification, and elimination of unnecessary&nbsp; provisions.&nbsp; In&nbsp; proof of this,&nbsp; while our Penal Code of 1887 contained 611 articles, our Revised Penal Code contains only 367 articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the articles of the old Penal Code not included in&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code, is Article 244.&nbsp; Does the omission&nbsp; or&nbsp; elimination of&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 244&nbsp; mean&nbsp; that now,&nbsp; common&nbsp; crimes&nbsp; like murder, robbery, arson,&nbsp; etc., committed in the&nbsp; course of a rebellion or sedition are absorbed by rebellion or sedition? Hardly.&nbsp; It cannot be that the committee on revision and our legislators abandoned the idea and the theory contained in said Article 244, because as I have&nbsp; already explained, all the&nbsp; Spanish commentators and&nbsp; jurists&nbsp; commenting on this&nbsp; particular provision of the Spanish Penal&nbsp; Code .are agreed that it&nbsp; is a just and reasonable provision,&nbsp; so that sedition and rebellion&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be utilized as a cloak of immunity in the commission of other serious crimes.&nbsp; To me,&nbsp; the reason&nbsp; for&nbsp; the omission&nbsp; is that it&nbsp; was really unnecessary.&nbsp; As Groizard said in his commentary already reproduced, even if that provision&nbsp; were not embodied in the penal code, the court would still apply said provision:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"No necesita ninguno el parrafo primero de este articulo.&nbsp; Aunque no se kubiera escrito en el&nbsp; Codigo, harian los Tribunates lo&nbsp; que dice.' Seria necesario para que&nbsp; asi no&nbsp; sucediera el que fuera la rebelion&nbsp; un motivo de exencion de responsabilidad criminal para las demas clases de delitos."&nbsp; (Groizard Tomo 3, p. 650.)</p></blockquote><p>The members&nbsp; of the committee on revision of our old Penal Code&nbsp; who must have been familiar with the opinion and comments of eminent Spanish jurists, particularly the above comment of Groizard undoubtedly, deemed the provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; Article 244 superfluous&nbsp; and&nbsp; unnecessary,&nbsp; and so omitted it in the&nbsp; revision.&nbsp; However, this omission&nbsp; of Article 244 of our Penal Code in the new, has an important effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; No longer shall we be obliged to prosecute murder, robbery, arson, kidnapping, etc.,&nbsp; committed in the course of and by reason of a sedition or a&nbsp; rebellion, separately. The prosecution is now&nbsp; free to combine these common crimes with the crimes of sedition or rebellion&nbsp; and charge a complex crime.&nbsp; And that is&nbsp; what has been dsone in the prosecution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; numerous cases of rebellion.</p><p>This&nbsp; idea, this&nbsp; theory of complex crime of&nbsp; rebellion with mutiple murder, etc., is not such a strange, extravagant or fantastic proposition or&nbsp; idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not the only ones&nbsp; holding this view.&nbsp; Out of seven separate cases, all involving the complex crime of rebellion with multiple murder and etc., decided in the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance, not&nbsp; long&nbsp; ago,&nbsp; cases No. 14070â€”People&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Lava; No. 15841â€”People <em>vs.</em> Hernandez; No. 2878â€”People <em>vs.</em> Capadocia;&nbsp; No. 10400â€”People <em>vs.</em> Salvador No. 2704â€”People <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Nava; No. 19166â€”People <em>vs.</em> Pomeroy and the same case 19166â€”People <em>vs.</em> Taruc,&nbsp; only one judge, Hon.&nbsp; Gregorio Narvasa, of the Court of First Instance of Manila, held that there is no&nbsp; complex&nbsp; crime of rebellion&nbsp; with murder, and his holding was based mainly if not entirely on the decisions of this Tribunal in the treason cases which as I have already explained, are&nbsp; not controlling or applicable.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the other cases, five&nbsp; judges of Courts of First Instance,&nbsp; Judges Ocampo, Castelo, Barcelona,&nbsp; Gatmaitan, and Montesa, held that there is&nbsp; such a complex crime of rebellion with murder and actually convicted the accused of said complex crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, in&nbsp; the case of People <em>vs.</em> Umali, et al., criminal case No.&nbsp; 11037 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Quezon Province,&nbsp; Judge Gustavo&nbsp; Victoriano, convicted&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; of the complex crime&nbsp; of rebellion with multiple murder, etc.&nbsp; Recently, in&nbsp; several criminal cases pending in Pangasinan, involving the complex crimes of rebellion with multiple murder,&nbsp; etc.,&nbsp; Judge Morfe of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of that province&nbsp; acting&nbsp; upon motions to quash the informations on the ground that there was no such complex crime of rebellion with murder and consequently, the&nbsp; informations were&nbsp; not in&nbsp; accordance with law,&nbsp; for&nbsp; charging&nbsp; more&nbsp; than one offense, in a well reasoned and considered order,&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the same and held that there is a&nbsp; complex crime&nbsp; of rebellion with murder. Of course, these opinions of judges of the&nbsp; lower courts are not binding on this tribunal but surely,&nbsp; they are persuasive and can not be ignored.&nbsp; At&nbsp; least,&nbsp; they&nbsp; show&nbsp; that there are others, learned in the law, who subscribe to the theory of complex crime&nbsp; of rebellion&nbsp; with&nbsp; murder, arson,&nbsp; etc.</p><p>Our decision in&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; People <em>vs.</em> Umali,&nbsp; (96 Phil., 185),&nbsp; promulgated&nbsp; on&nbsp; November 29,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; is another proof that murders committed in the course of sedition or rebellion&nbsp; are not&nbsp; absorbed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter.&nbsp; In said case, this court in a&nbsp; unanimous decision&nbsp; found the defendants therein guilty of&nbsp; sedition, multiple murder,&nbsp; arson,&nbsp; frustrated murder&nbsp; and physical injuries and sentenced&nbsp; them accordingly.&nbsp; The question may again be asked, if there is such a complex crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; sedition with&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; arson, etc.,&nbsp; why&nbsp; were Umali&nbsp; and his&nbsp; co-accused not&nbsp; convicted of this complex&nbsp; crime?&nbsp; The answer is found in a portion of our decision&nbsp; in that&nbsp; case which we quote:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The last point&nbsp; to be determined is the nature of the offense or offenses committed.&nbsp; Appellants were charged with and convicted of the complex crime of&nbsp; rebellion with multiple&nbsp; murder, frustrated murder, arson and&nbsp; robbery.&nbsp; Is there such&nbsp; a&nbsp; complex crime&nbsp; of rebellion with multiple murder, etc? While the Solicitor General in his brief claims that appellants&nbsp; are guilty of&nbsp; said complex crime and&nbsp; in&nbsp; support of&nbsp; his stand 'asks&nbsp; for leave&nbsp; to&nbsp; incorporate by reference his previous&nbsp; arguments&nbsp; in opposing Umali's petition for bail, counsel for appellants&nbsp; considered it unnecessary to discuss the existence or non-existence of such complex crime, saying that the nature of the crime committed is of no moment to herein appellants because they&nbsp; had absolutely no part in it&nbsp; whatsoever'.&nbsp; For the present, and with respect to this particular case, we deem it unnecessary to decide this&nbsp; important and controversial question, deferring its consideration and determination to another case or occasion more opportune, when&nbsp; it is more directly and&nbsp; squarely raised and both parties given an opportunity to discuss and argue the question more adequately&nbsp; and exhaustively. Considering that, assuming&nbsp; for the moment that there is no such complex crime of rebellion with murder, etc., and that&nbsp; consequently appellants&nbsp; could not have&nbsp; been legally charged with it, much less convicted&nbsp; of said complex crime, and the information should therefore, be regarded&nbsp; as&nbsp; having&nbsp; charged more than one&nbsp; offense, contrary to Rule 106, section 12 and Rule 113, section&nbsp; 2(e)t of the Rules of&nbsp; Court, but that appellants&nbsp; having interposed no objection thereto, they were properly tried for and lawfully convicted&nbsp; if&nbsp; guilty of&nbsp; the&nbsp; several and separate&nbsp; crimes charged therein, we have decided and&nbsp; we rule&nbsp; that the&nbsp; appellants may properly&nbsp; be&nbsp; convicted of&nbsp; said several&nbsp; and separate crimes, as hereinafter specified.&nbsp; We feel particularly supported and justified in this stand that we take, by the result of the case, namely, that the prison sentence we impose does&nbsp; not exceed, except perhaps in actual duration, that meted out&nbsp; by the court below, which is life imprisonment."</p></blockquote><p>The majority resolution invokes and applies the principle of the&nbsp; so&nbsp; called pro reo in&nbsp; connection with&nbsp; Article 48 of our Revised&nbsp; Penal Code on&nbsp; complex crimes,&nbsp; to the effect that said article should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be applied when the resulting penalty exceeds&nbsp; the sum total of&nbsp; the several crimes committed&nbsp; constituting the&nbsp; complex crime.&nbsp; According to the majority,&nbsp; the theory&nbsp; of pro reo&nbsp; is that&nbsp; the principle of complex crime was adopted for the benefit of the accused and not to his prejudice; so, it&nbsp; is to be applied when the maximum of the&nbsp; penalty for the more serious crime is less in&nbsp; severity or duration of imprisonment than the sum total of the several crimes committed, but not&nbsp; otherwise. This is a novel theory in this jurisdiction.&nbsp; To my knowledge it&nbsp; has never been advanced before.&nbsp; All&nbsp; along and during&nbsp; all these&nbsp; years, the&nbsp; courts&nbsp; of this&nbsp; country not excluding this august tribunal had been applying the provisions of Article&nbsp; 48 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, and its source,&nbsp; Article 89 of&nbsp; our Penal Code of&nbsp; 1887,&nbsp; regardless of whether or not the&nbsp; resulting&nbsp; penalty was prejudicial to the accused.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; in&nbsp; most cases the resulting penalty imposed by this tribunal in complex crimes was much more&nbsp; severe and of longer duration (imprisonment)&nbsp; than the sum total of the two or more crimes committed.&nbsp; In the numerous cases decided by this court involving the complex crime of estafa through falsification, the maximum of the penalty for the&nbsp; more serious&nbsp; crime of falsification was imposed although it exceeded the total of the penalties for estafa and for falsification.&nbsp; In cases of rape with physical injuries the maximum of the penalty&nbsp; for the crime of rape was imposed although it exceeded&nbsp; in duration and&nbsp; severity the total of the&nbsp; penalty for rape&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; for the relatively light penalty for physical injuries.&nbsp; In the case of People <em>vs.</em> Parulan (88 Phil., 615),&nbsp; involving the complex crime of kidnapping with murder,&nbsp; this&nbsp; tribunal applied the provision of Article 48&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code and would have sentenced the accused&nbsp; to death,&nbsp; were it not for one dissenting vote based not on&nbsp; the applicability of Article 48, but on the question of jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said this&nbsp; court:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"La pena que debe imponerse al acusado Parulan es la del delito mas grave de secuestro&nbsp; en su grado maximo, o sea, pena capital. Pero&nbsp; el Magistrado Sr. Tuason, consecuente con&nbsp; su opinion disidente en Parulan contra Rodas, supra, no puede confirmar la pena capital impuesta por el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila que segun el&nbsp; no tenia jurisdiccion sobre la presente causa. En vista de&nbsp; este voto disidente, el presidente del tribunal Sr. Paras y tres magistrados aunque&nbsp; creen que el acusado Parulan, por las pruebas presentadas, merece&nbsp; pena capital, con todo no pueden votar&nbsp; por la confirmacion porque&nbsp; el delito se&nbsp; cometio antes de la aprobacion de la Ley de&nbsp; la ' Republica No. 296,&nbsp; que so1o exige ocho votos para la imposicion&nbsp; de la&nbsp; pena capital. Automaticamente,&nbsp; por&nbsp; ministerio&nbsp; de la ley&nbsp; debe imponerse a Parulan la pena inmediatamente&nbsp; inferior a la de muerte, : que es&nbsp; la de reclusion perpetua con las accesorias."&nbsp;&nbsp; (88 Phil., p. 624.)</p></blockquote><p>Then in the case of People <em>vs.</em> Guillen<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 47 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 3433, involving the complex crime of murder&nbsp; and multiple attempted murder committed by the accused with a&nbsp; single&nbsp; act of hurling a hand grenade at President&nbsp; Roxas, this tribunal in a per curiam decision, ignoring the aggravating circumstances that attended the commission of the crime,&nbsp; applied the maximum of the penalty for&nbsp; the more serious&nbsp; crime of murder in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 48&nbsp; of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code&nbsp; and&nbsp; sentenced the&nbsp; accused to death. Other instances and cases may be cited ad&nbsp; libitum to show that in this jurisdiction and in this tribunal, the&nbsp; principle of pro reo was never&nbsp; entertained,&nbsp; much less accepted.</p><p align="center">Origin of&nbsp; <em>pro reo</em> principle</p><p>Up&nbsp; to the&nbsp; year 1908, the Spanish Penal Code had the following&nbsp; provisions for&nbsp; complex crimes:</p><blockquote><p>"Las disposiciones del articulo anterior no&nbsp; son aplicables&nbsp; en el caso de que&nbsp; un solo hecho constituya&nbsp; dos o mas deflitos, o cuando el uno&nbsp; de ellos sea medio necesario para cometer el&nbsp; otro.</p><p>"En estos casos solo se impondra la pena correspondiente al&nbsp; delito mas grave,&nbsp; aplicandola en su grado maximo."</p></blockquote><p>The above&nbsp; provisions were copied in&nbsp; our Penal Code of 1887&nbsp; under Article&nbsp; 89 which reads thus:</p><blockquote><p>"The provisions of the next preceding article are not&nbsp; applicable to&nbsp; cases in&nbsp; which a single act constitutes two or more&nbsp; crimes, or when one offense is a necessary means for committing the&nbsp; other.&nbsp; </p><p>"In&nbsp; these&nbsp; cases, only the penalty&nbsp; of the more serious crime shall be imposed,&nbsp; the same to be applied in its maximum degree."</p></blockquote><p>On January 3, 1908,&nbsp; the Spanish&nbsp; Penal Code&nbsp; was amended, particularly paragraph 2 of&nbsp; Article 90 thereof so as to&nbsp; add&nbsp; to said paragraph&nbsp; the&nbsp; following clause:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Hasta el&nbsp; limite que represente la suma de las dos que pudieran imponerse, penando separadamente ambbs delitos."</p></blockquote><p>so that since&nbsp; January 1908, Article 90 of the Spanish Penal Code reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Las disposiciones del articulo anterior no&nbsp; son aplicables&nbsp; en el caso de que&nbsp; un solo hecho constituya dos o mas&nbsp; delitos, o cuando el&nbsp; uno de ellos sea medio&nbsp; necesario&nbsp; para cometer el otro.&nbsp; </p><p>"En estos casos solo se impondra la pena correspondiente al&nbsp; delito mas grave,&nbsp; aplicandola&nbsp; en su grado maximo hasta el&nbsp; limite que represente la suma&nbsp; de&nbsp; las dos que pudieran imponerse, penando separadamente&nbsp; ambos delitos."</p></blockquote><p>The amendment is the provision for&nbsp; the so&nbsp; called pro reo rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; we never accepted much&nbsp; less followed said innovation in the Philippines.&nbsp; We did not amend Article 89 of our old Penal&nbsp; Code particularly&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 2 thereof so as to add the clause:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Hasta el limite que represente la suma de las dos que pudieran imponerse, penando separadamente ambos delitos."</p></blockquote><p>inserted by the amending Spanish Law of January 3, 1908 to the second paragraph of Article 90 of the Spanish Pent] Code.&nbsp; Furthermore, when we drafted and promulgated our Revised Penal Code in 1932 (Article No. 3815) we ignored and did not accept the amendment&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Spanish Penal Code that favored one accused&nbsp; of&nbsp; a complex crime as regards the penalty, so that now our law on the subject is contained in Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code which as amended by Act No.&nbsp; 4000, reads as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Art. 48. <em>Penalty for complex crimes.</em>â€”When&nbsp; a single act constitutes two or more grave or&nbsp; less felonies,&nbsp; or when an&nbsp; offense is a necessary means for committing the other, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be applied&nbsp; in its maximum&nbsp; period.&nbsp; (As amended&nbsp; by Act&nbsp; No. 4000.)</p></blockquote><p>The majority resolution makes a more&nbsp; or less extensive dissertation and citation&nbsp; of authorities on the law&nbsp; of extradition, intended to show that common crimes such as murder, etc., committed on the occasion of or in&nbsp; the course of the commission of political&nbsp; crimes like sedition&nbsp; and rebellion,&nbsp; are not&nbsp; subject to extradition.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that these citations and these arguments&nbsp; are&nbsp; neither relevant nor applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp; All we can say is that a murder&nbsp; committed in the course of a rebellion or sedition may be&nbsp; considered a&nbsp; political crime in contemplation of the extradition law and that a person accused of said murder&nbsp; is not subject to extradition.&nbsp; But a crime may be considered political from the&nbsp; standpoint of the extradition law and yet may be regarded by the country where committed as&nbsp; a common crime separate and distinct from the rebellion or sedition in the course of which it was committed, and, consequently, subject to&nbsp; prosecution. Moreover, the fact that a murder committed in the course&nbsp; of a sedition or rebellion&nbsp; is excluded from the scope of the extradition agreement between nations, is proof&nbsp; and argument that were&nbsp; it not for its exclusion, the member nations of the extradition agreement, where murders are committed in the course of a rebellion or sedition may and&nbsp; would extradite the offenders, on the theory&nbsp; that said murders&nbsp; are separate from and are not absorbed by the rebellion or sedition;&nbsp; otherwise, there would be no need for excluding&nbsp; such crimes of murder,&nbsp; arson, etc., committed during a&nbsp; rebellion&nbsp; or&nbsp; sedition, from the scope of the extradition&nbsp; law.&nbsp; And among such&nbsp; nations which consider these common crimes of murder,&nbsp; etc, as separate from rebellion or&nbsp; sedition during which they were committed,&nbsp; are Spain, as shown by&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 259 of&nbsp; its Penal Code, and the&nbsp; Philippines as illustrated in the cases of U.S. <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Cabrera and People <em>vs.</em> Umali, supra.&nbsp; Groizard lists down&nbsp; several countries that consider common crimes committed&nbsp; during a rebellion&nbsp; or sedition&nbsp; as&nbsp; subject to prosecution:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Codigo&nbsp; del&nbsp; Canton de Zurich.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>S.&nbsp; 75.&nbsp;&nbsp; Si con motivo&nbsp; de la sedicio'n o como consecuencia fueren cometidos&nbsp; otros delitos, Â£stos seran castigados conforme a las disposiciones penales para los mismos fijadas.

Their case is now pending appeal in this tribunal and their guilt or innocence of said charges or counts&nbsp; will be decided in due&nbsp; time.&nbsp; And&nbsp; so, I am not&nbsp; imputing or attributing&nbsp; to&nbsp; them the serious violations of law I have mentioned in this opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather, I am making general reference to the&nbsp; informations filed in other cases, especially in the informations against Luis Taruc and William Pomeroy which case&nbsp; is not only decided but also&nbsp; is closed.</p><p>In conclusion,&nbsp; I hold&nbsp; that under&nbsp; the&nbsp; law and under general&nbsp; principles&nbsp; rebellion&nbsp; punished&nbsp; with&nbsp; a maximum penalty&nbsp; of twelve&nbsp; (12)&nbsp; years&nbsp; and&nbsp; fine cannot possibly absorb a much more serious crimes like&nbsp; murder or kidnapping which are capital offenses&nbsp; and carry the maximum penalty of death.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard for the mind to grasp the idea that a person committing one lone murder&nbsp; may be headed for the electric chair; but if perpetrates several&nbsp; murders, kidnappings, arsons, and robberies and during their perpetration, was still committing another&nbsp; crime, that of trying to overthrow his own government by force, then all he gets is twelve years and fine.&nbsp; Since, the&nbsp; serious crimes&nbsp; like multiple&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; robbery,&nbsp; arson,&nbsp; kidnapping,&nbsp; etc., committed during the rebellion are not ingredients of, nor are they indispensable to the&nbsp; commission of rebellion, and were but means freely selected&nbsp; by the rebels to facilitate their commission of rebellion or to achieve and&nbsp; speed up their realization of their object, which was to overthrow the government and implant their own system said to be of communistic ideology, then&nbsp; under&nbsp; Article 48&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code, the complex crime of rebellion with murder, etc., was committed.</p><p>Judging by&nbsp; the&nbsp; numerous acts of&nbsp; atrocity&nbsp; contained in the&nbsp; several informations filed against the rebels in different cases, not only government soldiers&nbsp; and officers, but&nbsp; innocent civilians by the hundreds&nbsp; were murdered. Stores and homes were&nbsp; looted;&nbsp; not&nbsp; only public buildings, like presidendas and government hospitals, but also private buildings and homes were burned to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as a result&nbsp; of these acts of terrorism,&nbsp; entire barrios were abandoned and landowners,&nbsp; especially owners of landed estates, evacuated to the provincial capitals or&nbsp; to the cities for&nbsp; personal security.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it&nbsp; seems&nbsp; that these&nbsp; acts of banditry&nbsp; and pillage still continue though on&nbsp; a&nbsp; smaller scale.</p><p>Settled public policy&nbsp; or the&nbsp; policy of the&nbsp; Government as regards rebellion and the crimes against&nbsp; persons&nbsp; and property&nbsp; committed by&nbsp; the rebels&nbsp; is&nbsp; clear.&nbsp; With their taxes,&nbsp; the citizens&nbsp; are&nbsp; maintaining a&nbsp; large army to put down&nbsp; the rebellion.&nbsp; Substantial rewards ranging from P500 to P100.000 are offered for the apprehension of the rebels, specially the leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp; A rebel leader with a P100,000 price on his head,&nbsp; after a&nbsp; campaign of several years by the army, and&nbsp; after the loss of&nbsp; lives of many soldiers and civilian guides, is finally captured.&nbsp; The government pays down the P100,000 to those responsible&nbsp; for the capture and charges&nbsp; him with&nbsp; the&nbsp; complex crime of rebellion with multiple&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; kidnapping,&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.,â€”a&nbsp;&nbsp; capital&nbsp; offense. Pending trial,&nbsp; he asks to be released&nbsp; on bail and under the&nbsp; doctrine being laid&nbsp; down by us, he is set at liberty, free to go back to the hills to resume his dissident activities where he left off, by merely&nbsp; posting a bond corresponding to a maximum imprisonment of twelve years (P12,000) and a fine the amount&nbsp; of which is left&nbsp; to&nbsp; the discretion of the trial court.&nbsp; If he jumps his bail and assuming that the full amount of the&nbsp; bond is confiscated,&nbsp; still, the Government which paid P100,000 for his capture is the loser. It will have to wage&nbsp; another campaign to&nbsp; recapture him and perhaps offer another reward for&nbsp; his apprehension. This would illustrate the wide divergence between the policy of the Government and the present&nbsp; ruling of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court. That is not as it should be.&nbsp; The three departments of the Government, the Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial Department,&nbsp; though&nbsp; independent&nbsp; of each&nbsp; other,&nbsp; should function as a team, harmoniously, and in cooperation, all for the public&nbsp; welfare.&nbsp; They cannot work at cross purposes. All three should be guided by the settled public policy of the state and&nbsp; this applies to the courts.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case of Rubi <em>vs.</em> provincial board of&nbsp; Mindoro, 39 Phil., pp. 718-19, this court&nbsp; speaking about the&nbsp; relation&nbsp; between&nbsp; interpretation of the law by the courts and public policy, said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"As a point which has been left for the&nbsp; end of this&nbsp; decision and which, in case of doubt, would lead to the determination that section 2145 is valid, is the attitude which the courts should assume towards the settled policy&nbsp; of the Government.&nbsp; In a late decision with which we&nbsp; are in&nbsp; full&nbsp; accord,&nbsp; Gamble <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Vanderbilt&nbsp; University (200 Southwestern Reporter 510) the Chief of&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of the Supreme Court of Tennessee writes:&nbsp; </p><p>'We can see no objection to the application&nbsp; of&nbsp; public&nbsp; policy as a ratio decidendi.&nbsp; Every really new question that comes before the courts is, in the last&nbsp; analysis, determined&nbsp; on the theory,&nbsp; when not determined by differentiation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; principle of&nbsp; a&nbsp; prior case or line of cases, or&nbsp; by the&nbsp; aid of analogies&nbsp; furnished&nbsp; by such prior cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; In balancing conflicting solutions, that one is perceived to tip the scales which the court believes will best promote the public welfare in its probable operation as a general rule or&nbsp; principle.'</p><p>"Justice Holmes, in one of the aphorisms for which&nbsp; he is justly famous, said that "constitutional law, like other mortal contrivances, has to&nbsp; take some chances.&nbsp; (Blinn <em>vs.</em> Nelson&nbsp; [1911] 222 U.S., 1.) If in the final decision of the many grave questions which this case presents, the court must take "a&nbsp; chance," it should bo,&nbsp; with a view to upholding the law,&nbsp; with&nbsp; a view to the effectuation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; general governmental policy, and with a view to the court's performing its duty in no narrow and bigotted sense, but with that broad conception which will make the courts as progressive and effective a force as are the other departments of the Government."</p></blockquote><p>Now, by the majority resolution, this Court would spread the mantle of immunity over all these serious crimes against persons and property on the theory that they are all covered by, included in, and absorbed by the crime of rebellion.&nbsp; Under this protective mantle extended by us, instead of curbing and discouraging the&nbsp; commission of&nbsp; these common serious crimes&nbsp; in accordance with public policy, the commission of said crimes would be encouraged.&nbsp; No longer would evilinded&nbsp; men, outlaws, bandits,&nbsp; hesitate to kill and rob and kidnap, because by&nbsp; pretending to be rebels or to be engaged in rebellion,&nbsp; their acts of atrocity would be covered by&nbsp; rebellion, for which they, would get, at most, twelve&nbsp; (12) years and fine.&nbsp; No longer would the spectre of&nbsp; the&nbsp; death penalty&nbsp; and the electric&nbsp; chair hang sword of&nbsp; Damocles-like&nbsp; over the heads of would be kidnappers, murderers and arsonists&nbsp; because by merely claiming to have committed another additional crime, rebellion, under the doctrine laid down by the majority resolution, capital punishment for all&nbsp; capital crimes they have committed or&nbsp; may&nbsp; commit, is automatically reduced to twelve&nbsp; (12) years and fine.&nbsp; It is evident that the effect of the interpretation by this Court of the law on complex crimes, in relation&nbsp; to rebellion and the common serious crimes committed during and in the course thereof, runs counter to the settled public&nbsp; policy&nbsp; on the subject.</p><p>Sad, indeed, is the role being played&nbsp; by this Tribunal in laying&nbsp; down a&nbsp; doctrine of such far reaching consequences and in my opinion of such baneful not to&nbsp; say disastrous effects on peace and order and personal security, diametrically and utterly opposed to&nbsp; settled public policy, when after all, we have now the opportunity and the choice of accepting and adopting another view,&nbsp; another interpretation of the law on complex crimes, to me more reasonable, more logical and certainly, more in accordance with public policy,&nbsp; and more in&nbsp; keeping with peace and order,&nbsp; personal security and the public welfare.</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, I&nbsp; dissent.</p><p><em>Endencia,</em> JJ., concurs. <br><br><br></p><p></p><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><p></p><p align="center"></p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 85 Phil., 307.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">DISSENTING:</span><br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><p></p><p><strong>LABRADOR, J,, </strong></p><p>I fully agree with the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Montexnayor&nbsp; in so far as he holds that the complex crime of rebellion with&nbsp; murder exists under our law.&nbsp; I&nbsp; also concur with the opinion of&nbsp; Mr. Justice Padilla in so far as he holds that the petition for bail should be denied because&nbsp; of the&nbsp; danger&nbsp; that the&nbsp; release of&nbsp; the petitioner-appellant may cause to the security of the State.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the appellant&nbsp; has, been convicted by&nbsp; the Courtj of First Instance, he may be admitted to bail in the sound discretion of the court.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the interest of security&nbsp; the&nbsp; discretion should not be exercised in favor of&nbsp; the granting of&nbsp; bail.<br></p></div>
