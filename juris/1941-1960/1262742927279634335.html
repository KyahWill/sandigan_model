				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, dated August 11, 1956, ordering the Register of Deeds&nbsp; for the City of Manila to cancel the original&nbsp; of Transfer Certificate of&nbsp; Title No.&nbsp; 4178&nbsp; and to deliver a&nbsp; new&nbsp; title to petitioner or her authorized representative, upon payment of proper registration fees, and&nbsp; from the order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; October 17, 1956,&nbsp; denying oppositor-appellant's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>This case was first elevated&nbsp; to the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals; but in view of its finding that only questions&nbsp; of&nbsp; law were involved,&nbsp; it certified it to this&nbsp; Tribunal&nbsp; for further proceedings by virtue of resolution dated July 24,&nbsp; 1957.<br><br>The case was&nbsp; submitted for decision&nbsp; on&nbsp; a stipulation of facts and on the pleadings of the&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; Said facts as far as they are&nbsp; pertinent to the case may be narrated as follows:<br><br>The parcel&nbsp; of land, subject matter&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; and later referred to as the&nbsp; lot, is&nbsp; lot&nbsp; No. 18-A-8,&nbsp; Block No. 2814, with an area of 95.80 square meters, located at Bambang,&nbsp; Int., Tondo, Manila, under Assessment&nbsp; No. 1068.&nbsp; It was declared&nbsp; for taxation purposes&nbsp; in the name of Florencia 0. Capote.&nbsp; However, the registered owner before the year&nbsp; 1941&nbsp; was one Eusebio&nbsp; Valdez Tan Kee under Transfer Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 56636.&nbsp;&nbsp; He conveyed the lot&nbsp; on October 31, 1941 under&nbsp; Transfer Certificate of Title No. 63121 to Hermogenes Pineda, who later transferred it to Dr. Andres Torres on December 20, 1946 under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 4178.<br><br>On December&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1947, for tax&nbsp; delinquency for&nbsp; the years 1945-1947, the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Treasurer&nbsp; of Manila, after the corresponding publication,&nbsp; sold the&nbsp; lot to&nbsp; Mena de Lara as the highest bidder, for the sum of P18.13.&nbsp; After more than one year, that is, on&nbsp; May 18, 1949, the City Treasurer issued a certificate of sale in her favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; was&nbsp; never presented for registration in the office of the register of deeds of Manila, nor any&nbsp; memorandum&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; made&nbsp; on&nbsp; the back of Transfer Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 4178.<br><br>It should be stated in this connection that at the time of the tax sale made by the City Treasurer on December 29, 1947,&nbsp; the lot in question was registered in the office of&nbsp; the City Treasurer for tax purposes in the name of Florencia O. Capote&nbsp; and was registered in the office of the register of deeds in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Andres Torres.<br><br>In the meantime, on December 20, 1946, Andres&nbsp; Torres. the registered&nbsp; owner, executed an irrevocable power of attorney in favor of Hermogenes Pineda, the same person who sold&nbsp; him the same lot on the same date, December 20, 1946.&nbsp; Said power&nbsp; of&nbsp; attorney covered&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; lot in question as well as another&nbsp; parcel, Lot No. 18-A-7.&nbsp; The power of attorney was&nbsp; in&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of the sum of P15,000.<br><br>On February 25, 1956, Andres Torres&nbsp; "in&nbsp; consideration of P1.00 and other valuable consideration, plus the consideration&nbsp; mentioned in the&nbsp; Irrevocable&nbsp; Power of Attorney&nbsp; executed by&nbsp; me&nbsp; dated December&nbsp; 20,&nbsp; 1946". executed a deed of conveyance of the&nbsp; same lot 18-A-8, in favor of Hermogenes&nbsp; Pineda and Mrs. Amalia Serrano, said to be&nbsp; husband and&nbsp; wife.&nbsp; At that time the lot&nbsp; was assessed at P770 as per&nbsp; Tax Assessment No.&nbsp; 1195.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deed of conveyance stated that the total consideration of the transfer should be considered as P7,500 (1/2 of P15,000 mentioned&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Irrevocable Power of Attorney) plus P1.00 or P7,501.&nbsp; It would appear that Hermogenes&nbsp; Pineda was then already dead because Mrs.&nbsp; Amalia Serrano, one of the transferees, called herself&nbsp; a widow&nbsp; and appointed administratrix of the estate of the late Hermogenes Pineda in Special Proceedings No. 1078,&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Pampanga, and that&nbsp; she was&nbsp; accepting the deed of conveyance for herself and for the estate of Hermogenes Pineda.<br><br>However, the deed of conveyance&nbsp; presented with the office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the register of deeds of&nbsp; Manila could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be registered then because the owner's copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title could&nbsp; not be presented&nbsp; and&nbsp; so an adverse claim was caused to&nbsp; be registered in said office on March 16, 1956.&nbsp; Up to the time&nbsp; of the presentation of the stipulation of facts,&nbsp; the lot in question was still covered by Transfer&nbsp; Certificate&nbsp; of Title No. 4178,&nbsp; in the name of Andres Torres.<br><br>On February 22, 1956, Mrs. Serrano inquired from the register of deeds about any incumbrance or claim&nbsp; on the said lot and&nbsp; the register of deeds&nbsp; issued&nbsp; a certificate stating that the tax&nbsp; sale in favor of&nbsp; Mena de Lara had not been presented in&nbsp; his office for registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the same date, February 22,&nbsp; 1956, Mrs. Serrano was allowed by the City Treasurer to redeem&nbsp; the&nbsp; property in connection with the tax sale,&nbsp; by paying&nbsp; the sum of P20.85. She likewise paid to the Treasurer the land taxes for the years 1949-1955 in the sum of P85.33.&nbsp; On&nbsp; June 9, 1956, Mrs. Serrano also&nbsp; paid the City&nbsp; Treasurer&nbsp; the tax corresponding to the year 1956,&nbsp; in the sum of&nbsp; P11.55.<br><br>On&nbsp; February 1, 1956, the&nbsp; purchaser&nbsp; at&nbsp; the tax&nbsp; sale, Mena&nbsp; de Lara sold the lot to Florentine J. Teehico, the petitioner, for the sum of P1,500.&nbsp; The conveyance was duly registered&nbsp; in&nbsp; the office of the register of deeds in the City of Manila on&nbsp; February 24, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with this sale and&nbsp; the registration in the office&nbsp; of the register&nbsp; of deeds,&nbsp; the stipulation&nbsp; of facts contain&nbsp; the following:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; As reflected&nbsp; from the documentary exhibit&nbsp; attached to the&nbsp; records we&nbsp; submit that the petitioner is&nbsp; a purchaser in good faith, not direct from the City Treasurer but from&nbsp; a&nbsp; third party who acquired&nbsp; the&nbsp; same property by virtue&nbsp; of an&nbsp; auction sale&nbsp; conducted in accordance with law."<br></blockquote>On the basis of the deed&nbsp; of sale made in&nbsp; her favor, petitioner Teehico, on March 12, 1956, filed&nbsp; a petition with the&nbsp; trial court asking that&nbsp; Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 4178-T295&nbsp; in the register of deeds&nbsp; for&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; covering&nbsp; the lot&nbsp; be ordered cancelled and&nbsp; a&nbsp; new certificate of&nbsp; title be issued&nbsp; in her&nbsp; name upon previous payment of the&nbsp; corresponding fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petition was&nbsp; opposed&nbsp; by Mrs. Amalia&nbsp; Serrano&nbsp; for her self&nbsp; and on behalf of the estate of&nbsp; Hermogenes Pineda. After hearing, as already stated, the trial court granted the&nbsp; petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason given&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court in support of its order granting&nbsp; the petition is that after the&nbsp; execution of the&nbsp; final&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale by&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Treasurer which&nbsp; was&nbsp; more&nbsp; than one year&nbsp; after the tax sale&nbsp; was made on December 29,&nbsp; 1947, all rights to redeem the property have become unenforceable.<br><blockquote>"* * *&nbsp; The contention of the&nbsp; oppositor&nbsp; that&nbsp; the certificate of sale&nbsp; was not registered&nbsp; and for that reason the&nbsp; one&nbsp; year period did not&nbsp; commence to run holds true, following the&nbsp; case of Metropolitan Water&nbsp; District <i>vs.</i> Reyes,&nbsp; 74&nbsp; Phil., 142-150, cited by&nbsp; the&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the oppositor and&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Tolentino <i>vs.</i> Agcaoili,&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; ft. Nos. L-4349, 4350&nbsp; and 4351. But&nbsp; this doctrine in these&nbsp; two cases seems&nbsp; to&nbsp; have been abandoned in the case of Paguio <i>vs.</i> Rosado, 93 Phil., 306. * * *"<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; trial court added:<br><blockquote>"Considering that&nbsp; the case of Paguio&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Rosado&nbsp; and the case at bar are substantially the same; that the taxes&nbsp; for the property in question&nbsp; for the&nbsp; years&nbsp; 1948-1955 are immaterial&nbsp; to the case at bar; that the deed of sale of Mena&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> de Lara in favor of the herein petitioner was&nbsp; executed on February 1, 1956, and presented for registration&nbsp; on February 24, 1956, and that the deed of sale&nbsp; executed by&nbsp; Dr. Andres Torres&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of Hermogenes Pineda and Mrs. Amalia Serrano was made only&nbsp; on February 25, 1956,&nbsp; the opposition&nbsp; is hereby denied."<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of our&nbsp; decision in the case of Leon C. Santos <i>vs.</i> Rehabilitation Finance&nbsp; Corporation, 101&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 980, we&nbsp; deem an extended&nbsp; discussion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; unnecessary.&nbsp; In said case which&nbsp; is&nbsp; very&nbsp; similar to&nbsp; the&nbsp; one before&nbsp;&nbsp; us,&nbsp; involving the same&nbsp; question&nbsp; of&nbsp; when&nbsp; the one&nbsp;&nbsp; year&nbsp; period of&nbsp; redemption commences&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; run, reiterating the ruling laid down&nbsp; in the cases of Metropolitan Water District <i>vs.</i> Aurelio&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; 74 Phi., 143, and Tolentino <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Agcaoili, G. R. Nos. L-4349-4351, May 28, 1952, we&nbsp; held that the period&nbsp; of redemption commences to run&nbsp; not from the date of the auction&nbsp; of&nbsp; tax sale but&nbsp; from&nbsp; the day&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; was&nbsp; registered&nbsp; in&nbsp; the office&nbsp; of the Register of Deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp; case&nbsp; we expressly said&nbsp; that the&nbsp; cases of Valbuena and&nbsp; Paguio were not applicable because&nbsp; they&nbsp; did not involve&nbsp; the&nbsp; question of&nbsp; when the period&nbsp; of&nbsp; redemption&nbsp; starts to&nbsp; run.&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote&nbsp; the pertinent portion of said decision:<br><blockquote>"Petitioner-appellant contends that the Metropolitan Water District case as well&nbsp; as the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Marina V.&nbsp; Toientino&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Romarico Agcaoili,&nbsp; G.&nbsp; R. Nos.&nbsp; L-4349-51,&nbsp; cited by&nbsp; the trial court,&nbsp; are not applicable; that what&nbsp; are&nbsp; controlling are&nbsp; those of Mercedes Valbuena&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Aurelio&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; et al., G. R.&nbsp; No. 48177, September 30,&nbsp; 1949, and&nbsp; Lourdes T.&nbsp; Paguio <i> vs.</i> Maria&nbsp; Rosado de Ruiz, 93 Phil., 306.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; In the two cases&nbsp; of Valbuena and Paguio the only&nbsp; question involved therein was the validity of the tax sale made by&nbsp; the City Treasurer of Manila&nbsp; for tax delinquency. There&nbsp; we&nbsp; held that it was not necessary&nbsp; for the&nbsp; City Treasurer to&nbsp; give personal notice of&nbsp; the tax&nbsp; sale&nbsp; and that publication .of the&nbsp; notice of&nbsp; the sale was&nbsp; sufficient. The question&nbsp; of the period of redemption and when&nbsp; it should begin to run was&nbsp; not discussed. On the other hand, we agree&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; that the case of Metropolitan Water District and Tolentino are applicable. In the Tolentino case, which also involved the&nbsp; non-registration of&nbsp; the certificate of sale, this Court went further and&nbsp; extended the doctrine laid down in the Metropolitan Water&nbsp; District case by saying, after citing Section&nbsp; 77 of Act No. 496,&nbsp; the following:<br><br>From the&nbsp; above quoted&nbsp; provision it appears&nbsp; that whenever a registered land is&nbsp; sold on execution,&nbsp; or taken&nbsp; or&nbsp; sold for taxes, or for any assessment to&nbsp; enforce a lien of any character, it is required that the officer's&nbsp; return,&nbsp; or the&nbsp; certificate, or affidavit,&nbsp; or other instrument made in the course of the proceedings which are required by law&nbsp; to be recorded, be filed with&nbsp; the register of deeds for&nbsp; the province where the land lies, be registered in&nbsp; the&nbsp; registry book&nbsp; and a&nbsp; memorandum thereof&nbsp; be made upon&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; proper certificate of title. This&nbsp; provision&nbsp; does not require&nbsp; that&nbsp; the document, to&nbsp; be registrable, be&nbsp; notarized. In fact it expressly permits an officer's return,&nbsp; or a certificate, or other instrument made in the course of the proceedings to be&nbsp; filed for registration.&nbsp; Of course, in effecting the registration the register of&nbsp; deeds does not have to issue a new certificate of title&nbsp; to the&nbsp; purchaser;&nbsp; it is enough that he makes&nbsp; a memorandum entry on the corresponding certificate of title to afford constructive notice to all the world.&nbsp; This is necessary in order that the registered owner may be apprised of the annotation of the encumbrance and may take the necessary steps to his interest.&nbsp; He may choose either to abandon his property or redeem it within the period provided for by law.&nbsp; This requirement is&nbsp; fundamental because it is one of the safeguards that the law establishes in order that owners of land who&nbsp; may have failed to take note of the sale of their&nbsp; properties&nbsp; for delinquency in the payment of&nbsp; taxes may be notified of the action&nbsp; taken in connection with their properties. The failure of petitioner to take this step&nbsp; vitiates fundamentally her petition.<br><br>"In those two&nbsp; cases, specifically in the Tolentino case, we held that the period of&nbsp; redemption of one year&nbsp; should start from&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of the certificate of&nbsp; sale or the final deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of the purchaser, so&nbsp; that the delinquent registered&nbsp; owners or third&nbsp; parties interested in the redemption may know that&nbsp; the delinquent property had&nbsp; been sold, and&nbsp; that they&nbsp; had one year from said constructive&nbsp; notice of the sale by means of&nbsp; registration within which&nbsp; to redeem&nbsp; the property, if they wished to do so.<br><br>"In further support of&nbsp; this doctrine of the necessity of registering auction sales, we have&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; Philippine Executive Commission <i>vs.</i> Abadilla, 74&nbsp; Phil. 68, wherein this Court held that as regards registered land&nbsp; sold at&nbsp; public&nbsp; auction in execution of a judgment,&nbsp; the registered owners may&nbsp; redeem&nbsp; the land&nbsp; so&nbsp; sold within one year,&nbsp; not&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of the auction sale of which they had&nbsp; no notice, but&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date the sale was registered." Leon C.&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, <i>supra</i>.<br></blockquote>It is&nbsp; therefore clear that&nbsp; in the&nbsp; present case the one year period&nbsp; of&nbsp; redemption commenced&nbsp; to run on&nbsp; February 24, 1956 when petitioner Teehico registered the conveyance in&nbsp; her&nbsp; favor by&nbsp; Mena de Lara in&nbsp; the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the register&nbsp; of deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be the date&nbsp; of&nbsp; registration of&nbsp; the tax&nbsp; sale&nbsp; for the reason&nbsp; that, as already&nbsp; stated, said&nbsp; tax sale or&nbsp; rather&nbsp; the certificate issued by the&nbsp; City Treasurer to Mena de Lara was never presented&nbsp; at the office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the register&nbsp; of deeds for registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is equally&nbsp; clear that inasmuch&nbsp; as Serrano redeemed the&nbsp; lot on February&nbsp; 22 or&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 1956, the&nbsp; redemption was made well&nbsp; within the period&nbsp; provided by law.&nbsp; In this connection, it should&nbsp; be stated that the sale made by Mrs, Mena de&nbsp; Lara&nbsp; to&nbsp; petitioner Techico was naturally subject&nbsp; to this right of&nbsp; redemption.&nbsp; Consequently, as&nbsp; a result of&nbsp; said redemption,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; lost all right&nbsp; and title&nbsp; which her vendor may have tried to convey&nbsp; to her. In other words, her petition&nbsp; before the&nbsp; trial court was without any right&nbsp; or basis, and so the trial&nbsp; court erred in granting the same. <br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing, the order appealed from&nbsp; is reversed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
