The facts as found by the Court of Appeals are stated by that court as follows:<br><br>"It appears that in Civil Case No. C-194 of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Sur, Laura Dinio was sued by one Consolacion Nolasco. Said Court of First Instance issued a writ of preliminary attachment which was levied on the property of the defendant in that case, consisting of trucks, trailers, and wreckers, all of various tonnage, to answer for the judgment that might be rendered against her.<br><br>"On December 21, 1946,  defendant  Laura Dinio and  the  Philippine  Guaranty Co.  Inc. filed  a bond in the amount  of P11,000 with the Court of  First Instance of  Ilocos  Sur  for the lifting of the attachment; said bond  was to secure  payment to the plaintiff of any  judgment she may  recover  against the defendant.  On the same  day,  December 21,  1946, said  Laura Dinio  and Raymundo Manalastas executed a counter-guaranty with mortgage (Exh. C) in favor of the Philippine  Guaranty  Co.,  Inc. (the  plaintiff-appellee in the present case)  in order to indemnify the  latter for any damage, prejudice, losses, costs, payments, advances  and any other expenses of whatever  kind and nature, including attorney's fees which the said Philippine Guaranty Co.,  Inc. might incur as a consequence of any execution  that might be levied on said  bond.  The counter  guaranty  with mortgage above mentioned was registered with  the respective  offices  of  the register  of deeds of Ilocos Sur and  Pampanga,  inasmuch  as the  real  property  of  Raymundo Manalastas, subject matter  of  the mortgage described in Exhibit C, is situated in Pampanga."<br><br>On June 30, 1948, judgment  was rendered  in  said  Civil Case No. C-194, ordering defendant Laura  Dinio to return to  plaintiff  Consolacion   Nolasco  the  sum  of  P10,000. Laura  Dinio  failed to satisfy the judgment so the Philippine  Guaranty Co., Inc., petitioner herein, deposited the amount of P10,000 with the sheriff of the  City of Manila to satisfy  the  judgment.  Thereafter, petitioner  herein demanded the payment of the sum  paid  by it to satisfy the judgment in Civil  Case  No. C-194 and as the  payment demanded was not forthcoming, the present action was  brought against respondents Laura Dinio and Pedro Manalastas in execution of the counterbond that they had filed   in  favor  of  the petitioner.   The  Court of  First Instance of  Nueva Ecija found for the plaintiff-petitioner but on appeal to the Court of Appeals the latter reversed the judgment, holding  that, the counterbond executed by Raymundo Manalastas was executed without any valuable consideration.  It  further  held  that  as  the property covered by  the counterbond  was  conjugal property of Raymundo Manalastas  and  Valentina Pelayo and as the encumbrance created by Manalastas was  in  fraud of his spouse,  Article 1413 of the  Civil Code should be  made applicable and in accordance therewith, as Raymundo Manalastas is  already dead,  an inventory of  the  conjugal property be made and  the obligation created by the counterbond be charged against his share in the conjugal property,  the incumbrance  created by the counterbond  being null  and void insofar  as  the  same could not be  covered by the share of Manalastas in  the conjugal property.  The court, therefore, in a final order rendered after a motion to reconsider the  original decision  had  been presented, ordered that the case be returned to the  Court of First Instance for the reception of  additional evidence and for such  other  important  proceedings  as may be  necessary and  proper  to determine  whether  or  not the  rights and interests of Valentina Pelayo, as surviving spouse of Raymundo Manalastas, was prejudiced by the incumbrance in question.   Petition for certiorari was filed in this Court against said decision and  the  same was given due course. <br><br>The important question presented  to Us for decision is whether or not the  counterbond, Exhibit "C," which Raymundo Manalastas,  jointly with Laura  Dinio, executed in favor  of  the petitioner,  The  Philippine  Guaranty Co., Inc., is  null  and void  for lack of  valuable  consideration in favor of Raymundo Manalastas. <br><br>It is  evident  that the counterbond executed jointly  by Raymundo Manalastas  with  Laura Dinio,  Exhibit  "C," was executed  by them  in  order to secure the bond  by the Philippine Guaranty Co., Inc.,  in  favor of  Laura  Dinio. The fact that the bond was for the benefit of Laura Dinio, and not for  Raymundo Manalastas,  jointly or  singly, does not  mean  that  the  counterbond was executed by  Manalastas  without any  valuable consideration.  The consideration in  such case is that which  supports  the principal debtor's obligation. <br></div"><blockquote>"The claim  of the appellants  that there was  no consideration for  their guaranty can not be sustained.  The consideration which supports  the obligation as to the  principal debtor  is  a sufficient consideration to support  the  obligation of  the sureties.  It is  not necessary to  prove  any  consideration as  between  them  and  the creditor."  (Pyle <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Johnson, et al., 9 Phil. 249, 251.) <br><br>"The proof shows that the money claimed in this  action  has never been  paid and is still  owing  to the plaintiff;  and  the only defense  worth  noting  in this  decision  is  the  assertion  on  the part of Enrique Echaus  that he received nothing  for  affixing  his signature as guarantor to the contract which  is the  subject of suit and that in effect the  contract was lacking in consideration as to him. <br><br>"The point  is not well  taken.  A guarantor or surety is bound by  the same  consideration that  makes  the contract effective  between the principal parties  thereto.  (Pyle <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Johnson,   9 Phil. 249.) * * * "</blockquote>See also Enriquez de  la  Cavada <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Diaz, 37 Phil. 982; Acu√±a <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Veloso, 50 Phil. 241. <br><br>The execution of  the bond  by the  Philippine  Guaranty Co., Inc.,  petitioner herein, in  favor of Laura  Dinio,  is, therefore,  the consideration for the  execution of  the counterbond  by  Raymundo  Manalastas.  It  is  not  necessary that such  consideration, the execution of the  bond  by the Philippine Guaranty  Co.,  Inc.,  redound  directly to  the benefit of Raymundo Manalastas; it is enough that it was favorable to Laura Dinio. <br><br>In view of  the  foregoing, the  decision of  the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed and set aside and that of the Court  of First Instance, affirmed, with  costs against the respondents. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
