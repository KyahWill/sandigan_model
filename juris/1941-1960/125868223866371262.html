together with the improvements thereon, and duly registered under Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 59684 of the Office of the Register of Deeds for the

<p>The Court rendered judgment dismissing the complaintwith cost against the 
plaintiff. She has appealed.</p>
<p>In Caoile <em>vs</em>. Yu Chiao, 49 Off. Gaz., 4321; Talento <em>vs</em>. 
Makiki, 49 Off. Gaz., 4331; Bautista <em>vs</em>. Uy 49 Off. Gaz., 4336; Rellosa 
<em>vs</em>. Gaw Chee, 49 Off. Gaz., 4345 and Mercado <em>vs</em>. Go Bio, 49 
Off. Gaz., 5360, the majority, of this Court has ruled that in sales of real 
estate to aliens incapable of holding title thereto by virtue of the provisions 
of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> both the vendor 
and the vendee are deemed to have committed the constitutional violation and 
being thus <em>in pari delicto</em> the courts will not afford protection to 
either party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> From this ruling three 
Justices dissented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>The action is not of rescission because it is not postulated .upon any of the 
grounds provided for in Article 1291 of the old Civil Code and because the 
action of rescission involves lesion or damage and seeks to repair it. It is an 
action for annulment under Chapter VI, Title II, Book II, on nullity of 
contracts, based on a defect in the contract which invalidates it independently 
of such lesion or damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It is very 
likely that the majority of this Court proceeded upon that theory when it 
applied the <em>in pari delicto</em> rule referred to above.</p>
<p>In the United States the rule is that in a sale of real estate to an alien 
disqualified to hold title thereto the vendor divests himself of the title to 
such real estate and has no recourse against the vendee despite the latter's 
disability on account of alienage to hold title to such real estate and . the 
vendee may hold it against the whole world except as against the State. It is 
only the State that is entitled by proceedings in the nature of <em>office 
found</em> to have a forfeiture or escheat declared against the vendee "Who is 
in- capable of holding title to the real estate sold and conveyed to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
<p>However, if the State does not commence such proceedings and in the meantime 
the alien becomes naturalized citizen, the State is deemed to have waived its 
right to escheat the real property and the title of the alien thereto becomes 
lawful and valid as of the date of its conveyance or transfer to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The rule in the United States that in a 
sale of real estate to an alien disqualified to hold title thereto, the vendor 
divests himself of the title to such real estate and is not permitted to sue-for 
the annulment of his contract, is also the rule under the Civil Code. * * * 
Article 1302 of the old Civil Code provides: * * * Persons <em>sui juris</em> 
cannot, however, avail themselves of the incapacity of those with whom they 
contracted; * * *."</p>
<p>Manresa's comment on this clause of article 1302 of the Civil Code is as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Irresponsabilidad del defecto alegada</em>.â€”Es la segunda de las 
condiciones necesarias para el ejercicio de la accidn. Algunos la expresan 
diciendo que solo puede intentar aquella <em>el perjudicado</em>, pero esta 
expresion puede conducir a ideas equivocadas, ya que la nulidad es independiente 
de la lesion, como declara el art. 1.300, y es licito al favorecido 
economicamente por el contrato pedir la nulidad basandose en causas a el no 
imputables, y en cambio no autoriza in ley el caso inverso.</p>
<p>Sencilla la regla contenida en el parrafo segundo de este articulo, puede 
complicarse cuando coexisten dos defectos del contrato, como puede suceder, 
derivandose a veces de un mismo hecho, verbigracia, el contrato celebrado con un 
incapaz por quien ignora que lo es: eneste ejemplo es indudable que la persona 
capaz no podra pedir la nulidad fundado en la incapacidad de la otra, pero si 
alegar el error o el dolo que padecieze si las circunstancias del sujeto eran de 
decisiva infiuencia en el contrato. (<em>Supra</em>, pp. 
708-709.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant argues that if at the time of the conveyance of the real property 
the appellee was incapable of holding title to such real estate, the contract of 
sale was null or void and may be annulled, and his subsequent naturalization as 
a Filipino citizen cannot retroact to the date of the convey ance to make it 
lawful and valid. However, if the ban on aliens from acquiring not only 
agricultural but also urban lands, as construed by this Court in the Krivenko 
case, is to preserve the nation's lands for future generations of Filipinos, 
that aim or purpose would not be thwarted but achieved by making lawful the 
acquisition of real estate by aliens who became Filipino citizens by 
naturalization. The title to the parcel of land of the vendee, a naturalized 
Filipino citizen, being valid that of the domestic corporation to which the 
parcel of land has been transferred, must also be valid, 96.67 per cent of its 
capital stock being owned by Filipinos.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without costs.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>CONCURRING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><strong>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</strong> 
<p>I fully concur with the opinion of Justice Padilla, but wish to stress, as an 
additional reason for the decision in the present case, that when this action 
was instituted in 1948, the disability of the original vendee had been already 
removed, since he was naturalized in 1941; and that the stockholders of the 
second transferee, Li Seng Giap &amp; Sons, Inc., who hold more than 60 per cent 
of its capital stock, had likewise become Filipino citizens before, and not 
after, the action to annul was filed.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
