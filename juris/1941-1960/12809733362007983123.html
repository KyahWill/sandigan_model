				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The accused was originally charged before the People's Court with 
the crime of treason on two (2) counts.  When said Court was abolished, 
the case was transferred to the Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte 
where the crime is supposed to have been committed.  Thereafter, the 
information was amended twice with the result that the accused was 
charged with treason on eleven (11) counts.  No preliminary 
investigation having been conducted with respect to the additional 
counts, counsel for the accused objected to their inclusion in the 
information, but his objection was over-ruled.  After trial, the accused
 was found guilty of counts 3, 4, 6, 7 and 10, and was sentenced to 
suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i><p> to the accessories of the law, to pay a
 fine of P10,000, and the costs.  From this judgment the accused 
appealed.</p>
  <p>    The only counts which in our opinion deserve consideration in 
this appeal are counts 6 and 7.  These two counts in substance are: On 
the morning of August 25, 1942, at about 8:00 o'clock, while Lino 
Ratuita and Segundo Rubio were taking a bath in a river east of the town
 of Pasukin, Ilocos Norte, Isidro Peralta and five policemen arrived and
 arrested them.  Both were taken to the <i>presidencia</i> where Ratuita
 was hit by Peralta with the butt of his rifle rendering him 
unconscious.  Peralta inflicted the same punishment on Rubio.  Ratuita 
and Rubio were then brought to Laoag, where Ratuita was placed in jail, 
while Rubio, with his hands tied, was brought to the west and was never 
seen since then.  Ratuita was later released after giving Peralta the 
sum of P200.</p>
  <p>    On a certain day in August, 1942, Pedro Balatico, a resident of
 Pasukin, was sent for by Peralta and thrown into jail, refused food and
 forbidden to urinate.  The motive for Balatico's arrest was the 
supposition of Peralta that he killed a Japanese.</p>
  <p>    The count which refers to the arrest of Lino Ratuita and Pedro 
Balatico appears supported by their own testimony and by that of Urbano 
Guerrero and Monico Caldito.  It appears that Lino Ratuita was arrested 
because he used to give food to the guerrillas.  Appellant contends that
 the testimony of Ratuita is unworthy of credence because on 
cross-examination he failed to state the names of the policemen who 
accompanied the appellant at the time of his arrest in spite of the fact
 that they were all residents of Pasukin like himself.  This assertion 
is not quite correct.  When questioned on the matter, Ratuita 
categorically answered that he knew at least two of the policemen who 
arrested him, namely, Cariaga and Tagabilla.  He even stated that when 
they arrived at the <i>presidencia,</i> it was policeman Prospero 
Ratuita who helped the appellant in maltreating him.</p>
  <p>    Counsel for appellant also assails the credibility of Pedro 
Balatico for the simple reason that he failed to tell the year he was 
arrested, as well as when he saw Lino Ratuita with his hands tied, 
limiting his statement to the laconic assertion that it might have been 
in 1942 or 1944.  This is true.  But, since eight years had elapsed 
since then, it is not strange that the witness should commit some lapse 
of memory.</p>
  <p>    It is true that Ureano Guerrero did not make mention of the 
arrest and maltreatment of Lino Ratuita, but he bore testimony with 
regard to the maltreatment of Pedro Balatico, which added to the 
testimony of this victim, complies with the requirement of the 
two-witness rule.</p>
  <p>    With regard to the testimony of Monico Caldito, which is also 
assailed by counsel as in violation of the hearsay rule, it appears that
 what Caldito testified as having learned through information refers to 
other matters and not to the act of maltreatment of Lino Rautita as to 
which he testified of his own personal knowledge.</p>
  <p>    With respect to count 7, which refers to the arrest and 
subsequent disappearance of Segundo Rubio, the same appears 
substantiated by the testimony of Lino Ratuita and Monico Caldito.</p>
  <p>    The defense of appellant merely consists of negative testimony.
  He and his witnesses merely denied the imputation made against him by 
the witnesses for the prosecution.  Obviously, such negative testimony 
cannot prevail over the clear and positive testimony of the prosecution 
witnesses.</p>
  <p>    The observation made by the lower court in this matter is 
significant.  It says: "It is obvious that the question is one of 
credibility.  All the witnesses for the prosecution know the accused 
Isidro Peralta very well, and almost all of them have known him since 
their childhood, or because he is their townmate. x x x.  The motives 
alleged by the accused for the said witnesses to declare falsely against
 him have not only been proven, but they have also been validly denied 
and contradicted by the same witnesses.  The denial and <i>alibi</i> of 
the accused cannot prevail over the true and positive testimonies of the
 witnesses for the prosecution, who actually saw, recognized and 
identified the accused in the commission of the overt acts imputed to 
him and proven at the trial, witnesses whose sincerity and truthfulness 
the court has no reason to doubt.</p>
  <p>    As regards the alleged lack of preliminary investigation 
relative to the additional counts, it suffices to state that this issue 
has already been dismissed for lack of merit in G. R. No. L-3880 
affecting the same accused.</p>
  <p>    Finding no error in the decision appealed from, the same is 
hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo</i>
 and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.<br> 
    <i>Feria, J.,</i> did not take part.</p>
