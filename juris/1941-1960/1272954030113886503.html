				<H3>FEDERAL FILMS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. POTENCIANO PECSON, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BULACAN, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>The Federal Films, Inc., a domestic corporation, seeks to annul the decision 
of Hon. Potenciano Pecson in the civil case No. 182 of the court of first 
instance of Bulacan wherein the respondents the Santos couple, were the 
plaintiffs and said entity, the defendant. Grave abuse of discretion is imputed 
to the judge because, according to the petitioner, (<em>a</em>) at the trial he 
permitted defendant's attorney to withdraw without complying with the rules and 
immediately allowed plaintiffs to present' their evidence, (<em>b</em>) he 
decided the case without hearing the defendant and (<em>c</em>) he illegally 
refused to give due course to defendant's appeal to the higher courts of the 
land.
<p>In their answer the respondents aver that "on the day of the hearing of Civil 
Case No. 182 <em>supra</em>, the defendants counsel, Atty. Pedro B. Gonzales, 
appeared and informed the trial Court that he was being induced by his client to 
apply for postponement on the ground that they did not have transportation 
expenses, a fact which he knew to be false and preposterous; that he could not 
allow himself to be an instrument in, or an accomplice to such a deliberate 
obstruction of justice, and that he was, therefore, withdrawing from the case as 
counsel for the defendant; * * * considering the stand of Atty. Gonzales to be 
justified and laudable, the trial Court allowed him to withdraw from the case, 
and inasmuch as the absence of the defendant was unwarranted and at the same 
time it attempted to maliciously delay judicial proceedings, the plaintiffs, 
upon their petition in open court, were allowed to present evidence in support 
of their complaint; * * * bus fare is only fifty centavos P0.50, per passenger 
from Manila to Malolos and it is inconceivable that a corporation or even the 
poorest litigant cannot have one peso P1.00 for a round trip ticket. To say the 
least, the pretext is altogether unfounded and Atty. Gonzales only complied with 
his sworn duty as a lawyer when he refused to be an accomplice to said attempt 
to delay court proceedings and frustrate, as a consequence, the ends of 
justice".</p>
<p>Replying to the blocking of defendant's appeal, respondents assert that the 
trial judge's action was justified, the notice of appeal having been filed out 
of time, the motion for new trial not having suspended the running of the period 
because, among other things, said motion was a mere "scrap of paper" or was 
purely pro-forma. Respondent's hasten to add in this connection, that the 
question of defendant's right to appeal has already been decided by this Court 
in a previous <em>expediente</em> with the same parties, G. R. No. L-2074, 
wherein this Court dismissed a petition for mandamus to require the respondent 
Judge Pecson to give due course and certify the record on appeal in the 
aforesaid civil case No. 162 for substantially the same arguments presently 
rehashed or expanded. This dismissal should be conclusive upon this aspect of 
the litigation. In G. R. No. L-2074 in March of this year, this Supreme Court 
ruled in effect that Judge Pecson had correctly refused to give due course to 
the appeal. That ruling is now final and binding upon the parties hereto.</p>
<p>The point concerning the attorney's withdrawal of appearance;and the 
.defendant's consequent defeat was a matter reviewable on appeal; of course upon 
laying the proper foundations. If any error had been committed by the trial 
judge, it could have been straightened out by seasonable proceedings for 
appellate review. But surely it was no mistake affecting the jurisdiction, nor 
such a departure from regular procedure as to call for the remedy of certiorari, 
specially where, as in this case, the petition is obviously utilized for the 
purpose of securing the revision of a judgment which has become final through 
the failure of the interested party to appeal in due time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>Premises considered, this petition must be declared without merit. It will 
therefore be dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
<p>So ordered.</p><em>Paras, Actg. C.J., Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Briones,
