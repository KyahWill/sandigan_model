				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; the order of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila&nbsp; presided by Judge E. Soriano&nbsp; dated February&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; granting&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; to dismiss filed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Leonardo Castro&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the complaint of the plaintiff Eduardo Brillantes.&nbsp; For a&nbsp; statement of the facts&nbsp; of the case we adopt that made by the trial court&nbsp; which we reproduce below:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>It appears that on December&nbsp; 1, 1953,&nbsp; the plaintiff filed a complaint&nbsp; against the&nbsp;&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Wage&nbsp; Administration Service&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; recovery of&nbsp; alleged unpaid salary&nbsp; and overtime pay,&nbsp; the said&nbsp; case&nbsp; bearing No. C-1046;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 15, 1954; the plaintiff and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant entered into an arbitration agreement whereby&nbsp; they&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; "1. That&nbsp; they&nbsp; submit&nbsp; their case to the Wage&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; Service for investigation"; and "2. That they bind themselves to abide&nbsp; by whatever&nbsp; decision this&nbsp; Office may render on the case and&nbsp; that they recognize&nbsp; said decision to be final and conclusive";&nbsp; that in&nbsp; accordance with the said agreement,&nbsp; the parties,&nbsp; assisted by their respective counsel, adduced evidence before the&nbsp; Wage Administrative&nbsp; Service; that on May 31, 1954, the latter rendered a decision&nbsp; containing its findings and&nbsp; the&nbsp; following dispositive&nbsp; parts "wherefore, considering the&nbsp; evidence presented, the claim for overtime and underpayment is hereby dismissed but the respondent is adjudged&nbsp; to pay to the claimant the amount of fifty pesos&nbsp; and&nbsp; eighty-eight centavos&nbsp; (P50.88)&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; to his salary for services rendered in the month of November, 1953 and to deposit the same&nbsp; within five&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; days&nbsp; from receipt thereof"; that no appeal was taken from the said decision, and that on November 10, 1954, the plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant with this Court over the same subject-matter and cause of action litigated between&nbsp; them&nbsp; before, and decided by,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Wage&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; Service,&nbsp; (pp. 22-23,&nbsp; Record on Appeal.)<br></p></blockquote><p>In support of its order of dismissal, the trial court made the following observation and conclusions which we quote with favor:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>It is evident&nbsp; that the&nbsp; aforesaid&nbsp; decision rendered by the Hearing Officer of the&nbsp; Wage&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; Service&nbsp; was&nbsp; pursuant to" the authority granted to the Secretary of Labor to "delegate any or all&nbsp; of his powers in the&nbsp; administration&nbsp; or enforcement of the Minimum Wage Law to&nbsp; the Chief of the WAS, who may act personally&nbsp; or through&nbsp; duly authorized&nbsp; representative"&nbsp; Republic Act No.&nbsp; 602,&nbsp; The&nbsp; Minimum Wage&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; section&nbsp; 12 (e).&nbsp; Section 7&nbsp; of the same Act also pertinently provides that "Any&nbsp; person&nbsp; aggrieved by an order&nbsp; of the Secretary of Labor&nbsp; issued under this Act may obtain a review of such order&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Supreme Court by&nbsp; filing in such court within&nbsp; fifteen (15) days after the entry and publication of&nbsp; such&nbsp; order&nbsp; a written petition&nbsp; praying that the order of the Secretary&nbsp; of Labor&nbsp; be&nbsp; modified&nbsp; or set&nbsp; aside&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; whole&nbsp; or&nbsp; in part&nbsp; * *.*." The jurisdiction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Wage Administration Service to render&nbsp; the aforesaid decision, as well&nbsp; as the remedy&nbsp; of the aggrieved party against such a decision,&nbsp; is impliedly recognized by the Supreme&nbsp; Court in Gonzales <em>vs.</em> Hon. Secretary&nbsp; of Labor, et als., ' G. R. No.&nbsp; L-6409, wherein it was said:&nbsp; "The&nbsp; point raised by the Solicitor&nbsp; General on behalf of the respondent&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Labor that petitioner's remedy&nbsp; is to appeal to the President of the Philippines is&nbsp; not&nbsp; well&nbsp; taken.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 7 of the law&nbsp; creating the&nbsp; WAS (Rep. Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 602)&nbsp; expressly authorized any person aggrieved&nbsp; by an&nbsp; order of&nbsp; the Secretary of Labor to obtain a review of such order in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court."&nbsp; In view of the failure of the&nbsp; herein plaintiff to avail himself of the remedy marked out by said Section 7 of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 602 within the&nbsp; time&nbsp; therein specified, the aforesaid decision&nbsp; of the Wage1 Administration Service became final&nbsp;&nbsp; . and&nbsp; conclusive, not only by clear&nbsp; implication but also by express agreement&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parties "That they bind themselves to&nbsp; abide&nbsp; by whatever decision&nbsp; this Office (WAS)&nbsp; may render&nbsp; on the&nbsp; case, and that they recognize&nbsp; said decision to be&nbsp; final and conclusive".&nbsp; To permit the herein&nbsp; plaintiff to institute the present case before this Court, atfer&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; had been&nbsp; finally aad&nbsp; conclusively decided by the Wage Administration&nbsp; Service,&nbsp; is&nbsp; therefore to allow him to go back on his own solemn agreement, to set at naught the provisions of Republic Act No. 602; and to encourage duplication&nbsp; of&nbsp; work, if not&nbsp; conflicting judgments,&nbsp; by&nbsp; authorizing a party first to file his case with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Wage&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; Service and thereafter, in case of an&nbsp; adverse&nbsp; decision, to refile the&nbsp; same case&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Court of First&nbsp; Instance.&nbsp; This could not have been the legislator's intention in the enactment of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 602.&nbsp; (pp. 23-24, Record on&nbsp; Appeal.)</p></blockquote><p>Attorney Manuel Y.&nbsp; Macias counsel for appellant in his brief concedes that the decision rendered by the hearing officer of the&nbsp; WAS is an order "issued pursuant to Section 7, above-quoted, of the Minimum Wage Law in relation to Section 12 (a) which authorizes delegation by the Secretary of Labor of his powers in the administration or&nbsp; enforcement of the Minimum Wage Law to the Chief of the Wage Administrative Service."&nbsp; He, however, contends&nbsp; that the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; go&nbsp; to the Supreme Court for review&nbsp; of&nbsp; said order granted by Section&nbsp; 7 of&nbsp; the Minimum Wage Law is not exclusive,&nbsp; because&nbsp; according to&nbsp; him, under&nbsp; said Section 7 the review, by this Tribunal is limited to questions of law and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; findings&nbsp; of&nbsp; fact&nbsp; contained in&nbsp; the appealed decision must be accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not entirely correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; The findings of fact made by&nbsp; the Secretary of Labor or his delegate are accepted and are&nbsp; conclusive only if supported by substantial evidence.&nbsp; So that plaintiff could well have appealed from the decision of the WAS to this Tribunal,&nbsp; even on question of&nbsp; fact, if he was&nbsp; prepared and in a position to show that the findings of fact of the WAS&nbsp; were not supported by substantial&nbsp; evidence. Then counsel for appellant, referring to the hearing officer of the WAS and his decision, says the following:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Appellant cannot accept the findings of fact in the 'decision' of the Hearing Officer of the&nbsp; Wage Administration Service because they are not merely contrary to the facts but a scandalous distortion of them with no other end in&nbsp; view but&nbsp; to favor appellee, the&nbsp; respondent employer.&nbsp; The Hearing&nbsp; Officer, to promote this' end, callously&nbsp; ignored&nbsp; appellant's evidence.&nbsp; His&nbsp; so called 'decision'&nbsp; is&nbsp; a mockery of justice, and absolute nullity for which no fair minded citizen can have any respect,&nbsp; (p. 5, Appellant's Brief.)&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>And of&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Soriano&nbsp; who dismissed plaintiff's complaint, the same counsel comments thus:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The court <em>a&nbsp; quo</em>&nbsp; refused to perform the functions&nbsp; of&nbsp; a trial court&nbsp; and rendered the foregoing ruling&nbsp; without any&nbsp; evidence having been&nbsp; first presented pro or con.&nbsp;&nbsp; It decided an issue in favor of one party and against the&nbsp; other upon the mere representations of the favored party and refused absolutely to hear the other.&nbsp; The court a quo's act in so doing is a plain violation of the right to due process p. 8,.Appellant's Brief.)</p></blockquote><p>The above is couched in strong and disrespectful language unbecoming a lawyer who is an&nbsp; officer of the court, and highly improper in referring to an administrative&nbsp; official authorized to render decisions and especially to&nbsp; a Judge of the Court of First Instance.&nbsp; If plaintiff-appellant and his counsel were&nbsp; dissatisfied&nbsp; with the findings&nbsp; of the hearing&nbsp; officer of the&nbsp; WAS;&nbsp; if&nbsp; they believed&nbsp; that the findings&nbsp; were a distortion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts as contained in the evidence, they should have appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; said&nbsp; decision to this Tribunal.&nbsp; And if&nbsp; they were really convinced that said hearing officer of the WAS delibeartely distorted the facts to favor the employer,&nbsp; they should have&nbsp; prepared charges of partiality&nbsp; and malfeasance and lodged the same with&nbsp; the proper&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; for investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now&nbsp; is neither the time nor the&nbsp; occasion to&nbsp; air&nbsp; said&nbsp; grievance, assuming for&nbsp; the moment&nbsp; that it&nbsp; is real and well founded. And as to the reference to the trial court, said court merely acted upon the motion to&nbsp; dismiss.&nbsp; It&nbsp; considered the complaint and the&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; was&nbsp; enough. There was no need for the presentation of&nbsp; any evidence. So, the action of the trial court was proper and warranted; which cannot be&nbsp; said&nbsp; of&nbsp; the comment&nbsp; and observations of counsel above reproduced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said counsel&nbsp; is hereby admonished to&nbsp; use more temperate and&nbsp; respectful language and observe more proper conduct in the future.</p><p>We fully agree&nbsp; with the trial court&nbsp; in its order dismissing the complaint on the&nbsp; ground that the action is barred by&nbsp; prior judgment.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; no question that the complaint filed by plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; with the&nbsp; WAS may be regarded as a suit by one party against another to enforce a right;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the WAS&nbsp; in&nbsp; entertaining said suit,&nbsp; hearing the parties and deciding the case acted as a quasi-judicial body and the proceedings before it were quasi-judicial proceedings, and conducted&nbsp; in accordance with law, and so was the decision rendered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only this, but the parties before&nbsp; the commencement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the proceedings&nbsp; signed&nbsp; an agreement whereby they submitted their case to the WAS, binding themselves by whatever&nbsp; decision the WAS&nbsp; may render&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same, and that they recognized the decision to be final and conclusive.&nbsp; After signing that agreement or pledge, plaintiff-appellant may not now be&nbsp; heard to say that the decision reridered&nbsp; by the WAS has&nbsp; no legal effect on him. Besides,&nbsp; even&nbsp; assuming&nbsp; that despite&nbsp; the agreement the decision did&nbsp; not automatically become final, still plaintiff's failure to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court as&nbsp; provided by the Minimum Wage Law&nbsp; (Rep., Act 602) rendered it final&nbsp; and conclusive and served as a bar to another action between the&nbsp; same parties&nbsp; involving&nbsp; the same&nbsp; subject&nbsp; matter&nbsp; and&nbsp; cause of action and the&nbsp; same issues.</p><p> In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Penalosa <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Tuason, 22 Phil. 303,&nbsp; 314, we held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; 'a judgment rendered&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; by&nbsp; a court of&nbsp; competent jurisdiction&nbsp; on the .merits,&nbsp; is&nbsp; a bar to any future&nbsp; suit between the same parties or their privies&nbsp; upon the same cause&nbsp; of action so&nbsp; long as it&nbsp; remains unreserved;' or in the language&nbsp; of Mr. Justice Field in the opinion just cited:&nbsp; </p><p>"It is a&nbsp; finality as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; or&nbsp; demand in controversy, concluding parties and those in privity with them, not only as&nbsp; to every matter which was offered and received to&nbsp; sustain or defeat the claim&nbsp; or demand,&nbsp; but as to any other admissible matter which migh have been offered for that purpose."'</p></blockquote><p>And in the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tejedor <em>vs.</em> Palet, 61&nbsp; Phil. 494, 502-503,&nbsp; we equally held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"'The rule is often stated in general terms that a judgment&nbsp; is conclusive&nbsp; not only upon the&nbsp; questions&nbsp; actually&nbsp; contested&nbsp; and determined, but&nbsp; upon all&nbsp; matters&nbsp; which might have been litgated and&nbsp; decided&nbsp; in&nbsp; that suit;&nbsp; and&nbsp; this&nbsp; is&nbsp; undoubtedly true of&nbsp; all matters properly belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; the subject of the controversy and within the scope of the&nbsp; issues.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *' "&nbsp; (citing 34&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., pp. 909-911.)</p></blockquote><p>The authorities above cited on&nbsp; <em>res adjucata</em> refer to decisions rendered by&nbsp; the courts.&nbsp; Are they applicable to decisions of a quasi-judicial body like the Wage Administration Service (WAS) ?&nbsp; The answer is in the affirmative, as may be seen from the following authorities:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The rule which forbids the reopening of a matter once judicially determined by competent&nbsp; authority applies as well to the judicial and&nbsp; quasi-judicial&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of&nbsp; public, executive,&nbsp; or&nbsp; administrative officers&nbsp; and&nbsp; boards acting within&nbsp; their&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the judgments&nbsp; of courts having general&nbsp; judicial powers.&nbsp; This rule has been recognized as applying to the decisions of road or highway commissioners, commissioners of&nbsp; motor transportation,&nbsp; boards&nbsp; of audit,&nbsp; county&nbsp; boards, tax commissioners,&nbsp; boards,&nbsp; or officers, the federal trade&nbsp; commission, school commissioners, police commissioners, sewers commissioners,&nbsp; land commissioners or officers, collector of customs, referees in bankruptcy' court commissioners, boards or other tribunals administering workmen's&nbsp; compensation acts, and other like officers and boards.&nbsp; However, a particular decision or determination may not be conclusive,&nbsp; as where it&nbsp; was not a judicial, as distinguished from a legislative, executive,&nbsp; or ministerial, determination, or the matter was not within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the officer or board. <br>&nbsp;*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *" (50 C. J. S.,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Judgments,</span> Sec. 690, pp. 148-149).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;* * * There are, however, cases in which the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> has been held applicable to judicial acts of public, executive, or administrative officers and boards. in this connection, it has been declared that whenever a final adjudication of persons invested with power to decide on the property and rights of the citizen is examinable by the Supreme Court, upon a writ of error or a<span style="font-style: italic;"> certiori,</span> such final adjudication may be pleaded as<em> res judicata</em>." (30 Am. jur., Judgments, Sec. 164, p. 910). (Italics Supplied).&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>In view of&nbsp; the foregoing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; order appealed&nbsp; from is affirmed.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
