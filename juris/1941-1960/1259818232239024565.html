				<H3>ROSARIO L. DE BRAGANZA, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. FERNANDO F. DE VILLA ABRILLE, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Rosario&nbsp; L.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Braganza&nbsp; and her&nbsp; sons Rodolfo and Guillermo petition for review of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals' decision whereby&nbsp; they were&nbsp; required solidarily to pay Fernando F.&nbsp; de Villa Abrille the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P10,000 plus 2%&nbsp; interest from October 30, 1944.<br><br>The above petitioners,&nbsp; it appears, received from Villa Abrille, as a&nbsp; loan, on October 30,&nbsp; 1944&nbsp; P70,000 in Japanese war notes and in&nbsp; consideration thereof,&nbsp; promised in writing&nbsp; (Exhibit A)&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay him&nbsp; P10,000&nbsp; "in legal currency of the P. I. two years after the cessation of the present hostilities&nbsp; or&nbsp; as soon as International Exchange has been established in the Philippines", plus 2% per annum. Because payment had not been made, Villa Abrille sued them in March&nbsp; 1949.<br><br>In their answer before the Manila court of first Instance, defendants claimed to have received&nbsp; P40,000 only—instead of P70,000 as plaintiff asserted.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also averred that Guillermo and Rodolfo were minors&nbsp; when they signed the promissory note Exhibit A.&nbsp; After hearing the parties and their evidence, said&nbsp; court rendered&nbsp; judgment, which&nbsp; the appellate court affirmed, in the terms above described. There can be no&nbsp; question&nbsp; about&nbsp; the responsibility&nbsp; of Mrs.&nbsp; Rosario&nbsp; L. Braganza&nbsp; because&nbsp; the minority of her consigners does not&nbsp; release her from liability; since it is a personal defense of the&nbsp; minors. However, such defense will&nbsp; benefit her to&nbsp; the extent of the shares for which such minors&nbsp; may be responsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 1148,&nbsp; Civil Code).&nbsp; It is not denied that at the time of signing Exhibit A, Guillermo and Rodolfo Braganza were minors—16 and 18 respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Court of Appeals found them liable pursuant&nbsp; to the following reasoning:<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; * These&nbsp; two appellants&nbsp; did&nbsp; not make&nbsp; it&nbsp; appear&nbsp; in the promissory note&nbsp; that they were not yet of legal age.&nbsp; If they&nbsp; were really fair to their creditor, they should have apprised him on&nbsp; their incapacity, and if the former, in spite of the information&nbsp; relative to their age,&nbsp; parted with his money, then, he&nbsp; should&nbsp; be contended with the consequence of his&nbsp; act. But,&nbsp; that was&nbsp; not the&nbsp; case. Perhaps defendants in their desire to&nbsp; acquire much&nbsp; needed&nbsp; money, they readily and&nbsp; willingly&nbsp; signed the promissory&nbsp; note,&nbsp; without disclosing&nbsp; the legal&nbsp; impediment&nbsp;&nbsp; with respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; Guillermo&nbsp;&nbsp; and Rodolfo. When&nbsp; minors, like in the instant case, <span style="font-style: italic;">pretended to be of legal age,&nbsp; when&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; they were not</span>, they&nbsp; will not later on be permitted to excuse themselves from the fulfillment of the obligation contracted&nbsp; by them or to have it&nbsp; annulled."&nbsp; (Mercado, et&nbsp; al. <i>vs.</i> Espiritu, 37 Phil.,&nbsp; 215.)&nbsp; [Italics Ours.]<br></blockquote>We cannot&nbsp; agree to&nbsp; the above conclusions.&nbsp; From&nbsp; the minors' failure to&nbsp; disclose their minority <span style="font-style: italic;">in&nbsp; the&nbsp; same promissory note they signed</span>, it does not follow as a legal proposition, that they will not be permitted thereafter to assert&nbsp; it.&nbsp; They had no juridical duty to disclose their inability.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; Corpus Juris Secundum, 43 p. 206;<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; consider&nbsp; that a false&nbsp; representation as to age inducing&nbsp; a contract&nbsp; is a&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; contract&nbsp;&nbsp; and accordingly hold that it&nbsp; cannot be the basis&nbsp; of an&nbsp; action&nbsp; in&nbsp; tort. Other authorities hold that&nbsp; such misrepresentation may be the basis of such&nbsp; an action, on the theory that such misrepresentation is not a&nbsp; part&nbsp; of, and&nbsp; does&nbsp; not grow out of, the contract, or that the enforcement of liability for such&nbsp; misrepresentation&nbsp; as a tort&nbsp; does not constitute an&nbsp; indirect method of&nbsp; enforcing liability on the contract. In order to hold&nbsp; the infant&nbsp; liable, however, the fraud must be actual and not constructive.&nbsp; It has been held that his mere silence when making&nbsp; a contract as to&nbsp; his age does not&nbsp; constitute a fraud which can be made the basis of an action of deceit."&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; Ours.)<br><br>"The&nbsp; fraud of which an infant may be held liable to one&nbsp; who contracts with him in the belief that he&nbsp; is&nbsp; of full&nbsp; age must be actual not&nbsp; constructive, and mere&nbsp; failure&nbsp; of the infant&nbsp; to&nbsp; disclose his age&nbsp; is not sufficient."&nbsp; (27 American Jurisprudence, p. 819.)<br></blockquote>The Mercado case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> cited in&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision under review is different because&nbsp; the document&nbsp; signed&nbsp; therein by&nbsp; the minor <i>specifically stated he was of age;</i> here Exhibit A contained no such statement. In other words, in the Mercado case, the minor was guilty of <i>active misrepresentation</i>; whereas in this case,&nbsp; if the minors were guilty at&nbsp; all, which we doubt it is of <i>passive</i>&nbsp; (or constructive) misrepresentation,&nbsp; indeed, there is&nbsp; a growing sentiment in favor of limiting the scope of the application of&nbsp; the Mercado ruling, what with the consideration&nbsp; that the very minority which incapacitated minors&nbsp; from contracting should like- wise exempt them from the results of misrepresentation. <br><br>We hold, on this point, that being minors, Rodolfo and Guillermo&nbsp; Braganza&nbsp; could not&nbsp; be legally bound by&nbsp; their signatures in Exhibit A.<br><br>It is argued, nevertheless, by respondent that inasmuch as this defense was interposed only&nbsp; in 1951, and inasmuch as Rodolfo reached the age of majority in 1947, it was&nbsp; too late&nbsp; to invoke&nbsp; it because more&nbsp; than 4 years had elapsed after he had become emancipated upon reaching the age of majority.&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of Article 1301 of the&nbsp; Civil Code are -quoted to the effect that&nbsp; "an action to annul a contract by reason of minority must be filed within 4 years" after the minor&nbsp; has&nbsp; reached majority age.&nbsp; The parties do not specify the exact date&nbsp; of Rodolfo's&nbsp; birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is undenied, however, that in October&nbsp; 1944, he was 18 years old.&nbsp; On the basis of such&nbsp; datum, it should&nbsp; be held that in October 1947, he was 21 years old, and in October 1951, he was 25 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that when this defense was&nbsp; interposed&nbsp; in June 1951,&nbsp; four&nbsp; years had not&nbsp; yet completely elapsed from October 1947.<br><br>Furthermore, there is reason&nbsp; to doubt the pertinency of the 4-year period fixed&nbsp; by Article 1301 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil Code where minority is set up only as a <i>defense</i> to an&nbsp; action, without the minors asking for any positive relief from the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; For one thing, they have not filed in this case an <i>action</i> for&nbsp; annulment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; They merely interposed&nbsp; an excuse from liability.<br><br>Upon the other hand, these minors&nbsp; may not be entirely absolved from monetary responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Civil&nbsp; Code, even if&nbsp; their&nbsp; written contract is unenforceable because of&nbsp; non-age,&nbsp; they&nbsp; shall make restitution to the extent that they may have profited by the&nbsp; money they received.&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 1340)&nbsp; There&nbsp; is testimony&nbsp; that the funds delivered to them&nbsp; by Villa&nbsp; Abrille were used for their support during the Japanese&nbsp; occupation. Such being the case, it is but fair to hold that they had profited to&nbsp; the&nbsp; extent of the value&nbsp; of such&nbsp; money, which value has been authoritatively established&nbsp; in the so-called&nbsp; Ballantine&nbsp; Schedule:&nbsp; in October&nbsp; 1944,&nbsp; P40.00 Japanese notes were&nbsp; equivalent to PI of current&nbsp; Philippine money.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore,&nbsp; as the share of&nbsp; these&nbsp; minors was&nbsp; 2/3&nbsp; of&nbsp; P70,000 or&nbsp; P46,666.66,&nbsp; they should now return&nbsp; P1,166.67.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; Their&nbsp; promise&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; P10,000 in Philippine&nbsp; currency,&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; A)&nbsp; can not be enforced, as already stated, since they were minors incapable of binding themselves.&nbsp; Their liability, to repeat, is presently declared without regard of said Exhibit&nbsp; A, but solely in pursuance of Article&nbsp; 1304 of the Civil Code.<br><br>Accordingly, the appealed decision should be modified in the&nbsp; sense that Rosario Braganza shall pay 1/3 of P10,000 i.e., P3,333.33<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> plus&nbsp; 2%&nbsp; interest from October 1944; and Rodolfo and Guillermo Braganza shall pay jointly<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to the same creditor the total amount&nbsp; of P1,166.67&nbsp; plus 6% interest beginning March 7,&nbsp; 1949, when the complaint was filed.&nbsp; No costs in this instance.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
