				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva 
Ecija "declaring that the Philippine National Bank had acquired absolute 
ownership of the rights, interests, and participation of the spouses Paulino 
Candelaria and Dionisia Tecson in the parcels of land covered by Transfer

and Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-6242 now Transfer Certificate of Title

Sheriff, Exhibits 6 and 7, except the right of redemption which had been lost; 
ordering the cancellation of the notice of attachment, Entry No. 15019 NT-6364

Company, Entry No. 32264, NT-6241, and the notice of attachment and certificate 
of sale on Transfer Certificate of Title No. NT-12344, Entries Nos. 15019, 
NT-3664, and No. 32264, No. NT-6241; and finally declaring the rights of the 
Philippine National Bank to the said properties free from any claim, lien or 
incumbrances in favor of the Luzon Surety Company. With costs against the 
defendant." From this judgment, the defendant Luzon Surety Company appealed to 
this Court purely on questions of law.<p></p>
<p>Inasmuch as the questions of fact as found by the trial court are not 
disputed, we will quote hereunder the pertinent portion necessary for the 
decision of this case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Civil Case No. 7647 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled, 
'Philippine National Bank us. Paulino Candelaria, et al., the Philippine 
National Bank attached the rights, interest, and participation of Paulino 
Candelaria and Dionisia Tecson in the parcels of land covered by Transfer 
Certificates of Titles Nos. 21035 and 21045 of the Register of Deeds of Nueva 
Eeija, Exhibit B. The writ of attachment which is dated March 25, 1949 was 
registered and annotated in Certificate of Title No. 21035, Exhibit F, and No. 
21045, Exhibit G, on March 25, 1949. Transfer Certificates of Title No. 21035, 
Exhibit F, was cancelled by Transfer Certificate of Title No, NT-6241, Exhibit 
H, which in turn was cancelled by Transfer Certificate of Title No. NT-12343, 
Exhibit J. Transfer Certificate of Title No. NT-6242, Exhibit I, which in turn 
was cancelled by Transfer Certificate of Title No. NT-12344. Exhibit K. All 
these certificates of title carry the attachment in favor of the Philippine 
National Bank. On Octoher 13, 1950, Paulino Candelaria and Dionisia Tecson 
assigned and conveyed to the Philippine National Bank several parcels of land, 
among which were those covered by Transfer Certificates of Title No. 21035 and 
21045 in consideration of the judgment rendered against them in Civil Case No. 
7647. This deed of assignment had not been registered or annotated in the 
certificate of title. Pursuant to the judgment in Civil Case No. 7647, several 
parcels of land, including the parcels of land in question then covered by 
Transfer Certificates of Title No. N-6241 and NT-6242, were sold at public 
auction in which the Philippine National Bank was the highest bidder, and the 
Provincial Sheriff ex-officio executed a certificate of sale in favor of the 
Philippine National Bank dated April 1, 1952, Exhibit D. This certificate of 
sale was registered and annotated on Transfer Certificates of Title No. NT-12343 
and NT-12344 on December 24, 1954.</p>
<p>"In Civil Case No. 5633 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled, 
Rafael Viola vs. Ricardo Linsangan, et al., the rights, interest, and 
participation of the spouses Paulino Candelaria and Dionisia Tecson in the 
parcels covered by T.C.T. Nos. 21035 and 21045 were attached by the Luzon Surety 
Company. The writ of attachment, Exhibit 2-A, was registered and annotated on 
certificate of title on April 5, 1949. By virtue of the judgment rendered in the 
same Civil Case No. 5633, the properties of Paulino Candelaria, including his 
rights, participation, and interests in the lands now in question, covered by 
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 12343 and 12344, were sold at public 
auction, in which the Luzon Surety Company was the highest bidder. The 
provincial Sheriff of the Province of Nueva Ecija executed a certificate of sale 
in favor of the Luzon Surety Company on October 10, 1951, Exhibit 5, which was 
registered on the same date. Paulino Candelaria and his wife having failed to 
redeem the property within the period prescribed by law, the Provincial Sheriff 
executed the final bill of sale on November 29, 1952, Exhibit 6, in favor of the 
Luzon Surety Company.</p>
<p>"Various incidents took place in Cadastral Case No. 51, G.L.R.O. Record No. 
1045, with respect to the conflicting claims of the Philippine National Bank and 
the Luzon Surety Company over the parcels of land covered by Transfer 
Certificates of Title Nos. 12343 and 12344. The Court, being of the opinion that 
the controversy between the parties involved a contentious litigation, did not 
resolve the preference of the parties, but ordered the registration and 
annotation of the final bill of sale executed by the Provincial Sheriff in favor 
of the Philippine National Bank and the Luzon Surety Company. The Philippine 
National Bank registered the final bill of sale in its favor, but no action was 
taken by the Luzon Surety Company." (Decision, Record on Appeal, pp. 
38-41).</p></blockquote>
<p>The several errors assigned by appellant in its brief consist in substance in 
that the trial court failed to hold (1)that the deed of assignment, Exhibit 15, 
operated as a complete payment and satisfaction of the judgment rendered in 
favor of the Philippine National Bank by the Court of First Instance of Manila 
in Civil Case No. 7647; (2) that said satisfaction of judgment served to 
extinguish or dissolve the writ of attachment issued in favor of said bank; (3) 
that the execution sale in favor of said bank was null and void since the 
judgment sought to be executed had already been paid or satisfied; and (4) that 
appellant is the absolute owner of the parcels of land in question by virtue of 
the final bill of sale issued in its favor in Civil Case No. 5633.</p>
<p>There is no dispute that the writ of preliminary attachment in favor of 
appellee in Civil Case No. 7647 of the Court of First Instance of Manila has 
preference over the writ of preliminary attachment in favor of appellant issued 
in Civil Case No. 5633, since appellee's writ was registered prior to the 
registration of the attachment in favor of appellant. There is also no dispute, 
as admitted by appellant, that a sale by virtue of an attachment retroacts to 
the date of the registration of the writ of attachment, and that the preference 
of the attachment creditor is determined, not by the date of the execution sale, 
but by the date of the registration of the writ. With this premise, it would 
appear that appellee has acquired a valid and preferential title to the lands in 
question by virtue of the final bill of sale executed in its favor by the 
sheriff as a result of the auction sale held in Civil Case No. 7647. Since 
appellant was merely a redemptioner who stepped into the shoes of the judgment 
debtors in Civil Case No. 5633 and has failed to exercise the right of 
redemption within the period prescribed by law, its right, if any, to the 
properties in question has become forfeited.</p>
<p>It is claimed however that after judgment was rendered in favor of appellee 
in Civil Case No. 7647 on September 12, 1950, the judgment debtors Paulino 
Candelaria and Dionisia Tecson made on October 30, 1950 an assignment of all 
their rights and interests over the parcels of land in question in satisfaction 
of the judgment rendered in favor of appellee and that said assignment has the 
effect of dissolving the writ of attachment issued in favor of appellee. And if 
we are to hold, it is contended, that the assignment thus made has the effect of 
dissolving the writ in favor of appellee, it follows that the writ issued in 
favor of appellant became prior and preferential and the sale made in its favor 
as a consequence thereof valid and absolute.</p>
<p>While it is true that a deed of assignment was made in favor of appellee by 
its judgment debtors allegedly in satisfaction of the judgment rendered in its 
favor, it appears however that the deed was never registered in the registry of 
property and as such it has not ripened into a conveyance in contemplation of 
law. The assignment failed to bind the land. And since the purpose of the 
assignment is the transfer of the ownership of the land in payment of the amount 
of the judgment which amounted to P63,737.53 and the conveyance did not 
materialize because of failure of registration, it would be incongruous to hold 
that that assignment in contemplation of law operated to dissolve the writ of 
attachment issued in favor of appellee. The best proof that appellee never 
intended to consider such an assignment as a full satisfaction of the judgment 
in its favor is the fact that it took steps to enforce its judgment through an 
auction sale where it bought the property as the highest bidder and was given a 
final bill of sale by the sheriff.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no incompatibility between the deed of assignment and the 
writ of attachment issued in favor of appellee, for the two can co-exist. The 
first is merely. one of the means by which appellee may avail of to insure the 
transfer of the lands subject of the writ in satisfaction of the judgment 
without in any way relinquishing the priority it has acquired over them by 
virtue of the writ,whereas the second is a precautionary measure taken to assent 
its rights over the land against third persons. Ordinarily, a deed of assignment 
may bind the assignee with regard to the land even if the deed is not 
registered, but not so when the right of a third party is involved (Section 50, 
Act 496). This is the situation herein obtained. Because of a conflicting right 
asserted by appellant, appellee deemed it best to carry out its writ of 
execution to the extent allowed by law so that it may derive the full benefit 
that the law grants to a prior lien holder. Under the law and equity, therefore, 
it is clear that the prior lien of appellee over the lands has not been lost 
with the execution of the deed of assignment Exhibit 15. Wherefore, the decision 
appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p>
