				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ALEJANDRO CALMA ALIAS "EAGLE," DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court, of First Instance of Rizal 
finding defendant-appellant Alejandro Calma, alias "Eagle," guilty of the crime 
of homicide, and sentencing him to a prison term of from 17 years, 4 months and 
1 day to 20 years, to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P3,000, and to 
pay the costs. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals, but the latter has 
remanded it to Us on the ground that only questions of law are involved in the 
appeal.
<p>The record discloses that defendant-appellant was charged with the crime of 
murder in an information which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 2nd day of July, 1952, in the municipality of Caloocan, 
province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and known 
premeditation, in the dwelling of Mariano Inocencio, who is 56 years old and the 
father-in-law of the accused, armed with a .45-cal. pistol, did then and there 
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot Mariano Inocencio on the different 
parts of his body, thus inflicting upon the latter three (3) gunshot wounds, and 
as a result thereof, Mariano Inocencio died instantly.</p>
<p>"All contrary to Law, with the qualifying circumstance of treachery and known 
premeditation and the generic aggravating circumstance of insult or disregard of 
the respect due the offended party because of his age and that the crime was 
committed in the dwelling of the offended party and the alternative circumstance 
of relationship, the offended party being the father-in-law of the 
accused."</p></blockquote>
<p>When the defendant was read the information on arraignment, he entered a plea 
of not guilty. When his case was called for hearing, after several 
postponements, the following proceedings took place in the trial courts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ATTY. DE LA CRUZ:</p>
<p>If Your Honor please, after conferring with the accused in this case I found 
out that he had already entered a plea of not guilty. But after we have 
discussed with the Fiscal the circumstances and the facts on record, I suggested 
that because it is not clear that the accused had premeditated the killing of 
the victim, I suggested that the information be amended to homicide in which 
case my client will be willing to change his plea from not guilty to guilty.</p>
<p>"COURT:</p>
<p>What do you say Fiscal?</p>
<p>"FISCAL:</p>
<p>I move, If Your Honor please, that the information in Crim. Case No. 3651 be 
amended from murder to homicide.</p>
<p>"COURT:</p>
<p>Motion granted.</p>
<p>"ATTY. DE LA CRUZ:</p>
<p>In view of the amendment to homicide of the information, the accused would 
beg this Honorable Court for permission to allow him to withdraw his former plea 
of not guilty and permit him to plead guilty.</p>
<p>"COURT: </p>
<p>Permission granted.</p>
<p>"COURT TO ACCUSED:</p>
<p>Your lawyer informed the Court that you are asking that you be allowed to 
withdraw your former plea of not guilty and change it with that of guilty. What 
do you say about that?</p>
<p>"ACCUSED:</p>
<p>Yes, Your Honor,</p>
<p>"COURT:</p>
<p>In view of the plea of guilty of the accused...</p>
<p>"ATTY. DE LA CRUZ:</p>
<p>Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p>"COURT:</p>
<p>Decision, x x x."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the plea of guilty entered by the accused, the court thereupon 
rendered the judgment appealed from. Against this judgment the defendant has 
prosecuted this appeal claiming that there was no valid amended information and 
arraignment and a plea thereto of guilty entered by the accused and that the 
lower court erred in imposing the maximum penalty for homicide and in not 
applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law. The Solicitor General joins the counsel 
for the appellant in the request that the proceedings be declared annulled and 
the case remanded to the court below for the amendment of the information, 
arraignment thereon, etc.</p>
<p>The record does not show that an amended information was filed by the fiscal 
or that amendments were inserted in the body of the original information rend to 
the accused. It is clear, however, from the amendment of the crime charged from 
that of murder to that of homicide, as announced by the fiscal. and approved by 
the court,, that the two qualifying circumstances of murder expressly alleged in 
the information, namely, treachery and evident premeditation, were meant to be 
suppressed from the information. The most proper course for the fiscal and the 
court to follow was to have the information then and there amended by the fiscal 
by making the suppressions or changes on tne original information read to the 
accused, or an amended information filed, and then to have said amended 
information read to the accused for his plea thereon. But the irregularity 
comitted in the case at bar seems to be a technical one, which should not be 
permitted to prejudice the accused and upon which the Rules frown. The prejudice 
to the accused of remanding the case for the filing of an amended information 
and his arraignment thereon would arise from the further delay of the 
proceedings in violation of the right of an accused to a speedy disposition of 
his case. In any case, there seems to be no question that the understanding 
between the prosecution and defense and court at the time of the trial was that 
the allegations of treachery and evident premeditation were to be considered 
eliminated so that the defendant-appellant would be charged with homicide and 
that he was pleading guilty thereto. This understanding is not questioned and 
was taken as correct by the defendant-appellant until the judgment was rendered, 
when he was sentenced to a term which the amended information could not have 
justified.</p>
<p>We find that the accused by his plea of guilty has admitted the commission of 
the crime of homicide attended by the aggravating circumstances of insult or in 
disregnrd of the respect due the offended party on account of his age and of 
dwelling. At the same time we should consider his plea of guilty as a mitigating 
circumstance, which should compensate one of the above aggravating 
circumstances. The defendant-appellant should therefore be sentenced for 
homicide with the attendance of one aggravating circumstance. The judgment 
appealed from is hereby modified, and the defendant-appellant hereby sentenced 
to a penalty which shall not be less than 8 years and one day of <u>prision 
mayor</u> and not more than 17 years 4 months and 1 day of <u>reclusion 
temporal</u>, to indemnify the heirs of the offended party in the sum of P3,000, 
and to pay the costs.</p>
