				<H3>PHILIPPINE TRUST COMPANY, PETITIONER, VS. LUIS MA. ARANETA ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by certiorari filed by the petitioner 
Philippine Trust Co. a banking corporation from the decision of the Court of 
Appeals, which affirms the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila.
<p align="justify">Before the occupation of Manila by the Japanese military 
forces, the respondent and appellee Luis Ma. Araneta was indebted to the 
petitioner and appellant in the sum of P4,000, and as a collateral therefor, 
said respondent pledged the certificates of stock listed in the decision of the 
Court of First Instance. The balance of P3,683.60 was, upon demand of the 
appellant, paid by the appellee on May 2, 1944, in Japanese military notes, but 
the certificates of stocks pledged could not then be released, because according 
to the appellant, at the outbreak of the war, they were turned over to the 
American authorities and sent to the United States for safekeeping. After 
liberation, appellee demanded from the petitioner the return of the certificates 
of stocks, out the petitioner refused to do so, on the ground that the payment 
in Japanese war notes was not valid.</p>
<p align="justify">A complaint was filed with the Court of First Instance of 
Manila by the appellee against the appellant to recover the certificates of 
stock in question, and the latter set up as defense that it accepted the payment 
of the appellee's obligation under duress, and therefore the payment was not 
valid. The Court of First Instance rendered judgment in favor of the appellee on 
the ground that the payment was voluntarily made and accepted, and therefore it 
was valid and extinguished the appellee's obligation to the appellant, and 
ordered the latter to return to the former the certificates of stock listed in 
the decision. On appeal from the decision of the lower court to the Court of 
Appeals the decision was affirmed.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellant admits that, as testified to by the then acting 
president of the petitioner during the Japanese occupation, "neither the 
appellee nor the Japanese military authorities exercised any duress on the 
appellee Bank to accept the payment." But the appellant contends that there was 
a collective and general duress exercised by the Japanese military occupant, 
because the latter ordered that the war-notes may be used in making payments of 
all kinds, and any attempt to interfere with the circulation of said notes, such 
as rejection of payment with said notes will be considered as hostile and will 
be punished severely (Proclamation dated January 3, 1942), and also ordered the 
reopening of such banking institution (not enemy banks) as may be notified in 
the City of Manila, one of them the appellant (Proclamation of January 23, 
1942).</p>
<p align="justify">The question whether or not said orders constituted a 
collective and general duress and invalidated the payment made by the appellee 
to the appellant is a question of law, and not of fact, and for that, reason the 
petitioner asks that the present appeal by certiorari be allowed, under Rule 46 
of the Rules of Court which provides that questions of law may be raised in an 
appeal by certiorari from a judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p align="justify">But even though such a question be raised the Supreme Court 
has, according to said rule, discretion to dismiss the petition if the Court of 
Appeals has decided a question in accord, with law or the applicable decision of 
this Supreme Court. As the judgment of the Court of Appeals in so far as it 
affirms the decision of the Court of First Instance which upholds the validity 
of the payment under consideration is in accord with the decisions of this Court 
in the cases of Laurel vs. Misa (77 Phil., 856), and Haw Pia vs. China Banking 
Corporation, (80 Phil., 604), the appeal by certiorari must be dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case of A. Laurel vs. Misa, this Court held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Considering that, although the military occupant is enjoined 
to respect or continue in force, unless absolutely prevented by the 
circumstances, those laws that enforce public order and regulate the social and 
commercial life of the country, he has, nevertheless, all the powers of a <i>de 
facto</i> government and may, at his pleasure, either change the existing laws 
or make new ones when the exigencies of the military service demand such action, 
that is, when it is necessary for the occupier to do so for the control, of the 
country and the protection of his army, subject to the restrictions or 
limitations imposed by the Hague Regulations, the usages established by 
civilized nations, the laws of humanity and the requirements of public 
conscience (Peralta vs. Director of Prisons, <i>supra</i>; 1940 U. S. Rules of 
Land Warfare, 76, 77); and that, consequently, all acts of the military occupant 
dictated within these limitations are obligatory upon the inhabitants of the 
territory, who are bound to obey thorn, and the laws of the legitimate 
government which have not been adopted, as well and those which, though 
continued in force, are in conflict with such laws and orders of the occupier, 
shall be considered as suspended or not in force and binding upon said 
inhabitants;" (Laurel vs. Misa, G. R. No. L-409,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> pp. 3-4, minute 
resolution.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And in the case of Haw Pia vs. China Banking Corporation we held 
that, under the rules of Public International Law, the right of the military 
occupant, in the exercise of his governmental power, to order the liquidation of 
enemy banks and the reopening of others in the occupied enemy territory, as well 
as to issue military currency as legal tender, has never been seriously 
questioned.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, it is evident that the payment made 
by the respondent-appellee and accepted by the petitioner and appellant during 
the Japanese occupation in compliance with the said orders of the Japanese 
military occupant, can not be considered as made under a collective and general 
duress, because an act done pursuant to the laws or orders of competent 
authorities can never be regarded as executed involuntarily, or under duress or 
illegitimate constraint or compulsion that invalidates the act.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the petition for certiorari is denied and the appeal 
dismissed.</p>

<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><i>CONCURRING</i></p>
<p align="justify">PERFECTO,<i> J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">We concur in the resolution dismissing the petition.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the facts in this case, we do not believe in the existence 
of the collective and general duress upon which the petition is premised. As 
stated in the resolution, neither the appellee nor the Japanese military 
authorities exercised any duress on petitioner to accept the payment in 
controversy.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p align="justify">TUASON, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">I vote to give this appeal due course. It is extremely unfair 
and unjust to the immediate parties and to prospective parties in numerous cases 
of this nature, for this Court to dismiss this appeal without the benefit of a 
full argument and without full deliberation in the light of all the 
evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">This case is of very far-reaching importance. This Court's 
action, arrived at on the basis of the findings of the Court of Appeals alone, 
might be taken as deciding, if it does not indeed actually decide, hundreds of 
cases of payment of pre-war obligations to banks in Japanese war notes. It is a 
matter of general knowledge that almost if not quite all such obligations were 
liquidated under circumstances which constituted menacing if indirect threats of 
severe punishment. It is also a matter of general knowledge that these payments 
if approved would spell the complete brankruptcy of the payees. Under all legal 
precepts and standards of morality and decency, the said payments are 
indefensible. I refuse to be a party to the sanctioning of this mass 
depradation. More it is a pity, because still more numerous 'debts in favor of 
private individuals, who can ill afford to lose what to many of then represent 
life savings, will be adversely affected.</p>
<p align="justify">I maintain that Japanese war notes were not legal tender and 
could not be made so by military orders. Accordingly, acceptance of payment in 
that money under compulsion did not operate to satisfy the debt except to the 
extant the creditor was benefited thereby.</p> The petitioner pleaded "general and collective duress." This 
plea should not be dismissed with a shrug of the shoulder. The point was not 
touched in the appealed decision, and because of its direct bearing on other 
payments involving millions, it is the duty of this Court to give it respectful 
consideration. Such duress was real and imminent. The very order of the Japanese 
High Command for the banks to open was an implied order to accept payments in 
Mickey Mouse notes. And working as they did under the noses of Japanese officers 
in or out of uniform, the 'bank officials had no way of turning down the 
payments without seriously risking their life or liberty. Had there been no 
threat, express or implied, it is inconceivable that the banks would have 
allowed outstanding pre-war obligations to be paid off, without at least a 
protest on their part, in money which in the latter part of 1944 had very slight 
value and in a few months more, as they knew, would be absolutely worthless.</div>
