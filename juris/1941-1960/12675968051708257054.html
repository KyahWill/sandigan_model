				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cebu 
granting the petition for naturalization as a Filipino citizen of Lock Ben Ping 
<i>alias</i> Joseph Lock Ben Ping.
<p>The petitioner is a citizen or subject of China, his legal qualifications to 
become a Filipino citizen is not questioneds and the only contention raised by 
the Solicitor General In his brief refers to the alleged failure of the 
petitioner to establish by competent evidence that under the laws of his country 
Filipinos may become naturalized citizens or subjects thereof. Specifically, it 
is insisted, for the appellant that the purported copy of the Chinese 
Naturalization Law (presented in evidence by the petitioner) should not have 
been considered by the lower court, because it was certified to merely by the 
Chinese Consul in the Philippines who is not the custodian of the original law. 
We need not pass upon this proposition, for "this Court has already accepted it 
as a fact in previous naturalization cases that the laws of China permit 
Filipinos to naturalise in that country." (Yee Bo Mann vs. Republic of the 
Philippines, G. R. No. L-1606, May 28, 1949.)</p>
<p>The appealed judgment is therefore affirmed, without costs. So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
