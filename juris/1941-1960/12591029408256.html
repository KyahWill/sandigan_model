				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The  City  of  Manila  brought  this action  before  the court of first instance of said  city against Arcadio  Pallugna to recover the amount of F2,923.75 being the difference between what  the latter should pay for the operation of  seven  (7) pinball machines under  Ordinance No.  3628 and what  he actualy paid under Ordinance No.  3347.</p>
<p>Defendant  interposed  the defense  that  Ordinance No. 3628  on which plaintiff bases its claim is  invalid for having been enacted in excess of the power conferred by law upon it and,  as  a counterclaim,  he claims the amount of  P735.75 as attorney's fees and expenses of  litigation.</p>
<p>The parties submitted a stipulation  of facts  from which the following may be deduced:  that defendant was granted license  to operate seven pinball machines during the effectivity of Ordinance No. 3628; that said pinball machines are of  the  flipper type and defendant  had  operated  them frcm 1956 to April 24, 1957, having  paid for  their operation a  license  fee  of P12.50 a quarter for each machine, or  a total of F437.50; that on April 24, 1957, when defendant was notified of the increase in the license fees under Ordinance  No.  3628 he retired from  business  and ceased operating his pinball machines; that on September 6, 1957, defendant  was formally advised by the  city treasurer to pay  a deficiency tax, including surcharge  under said ordinance, in  the  amount  of Pl,983.75 for  the operation of said seven  pinball  machines;  and that  on September 12, 1957, defendant requested the city treasurer to desist from collecting the  aforesaid deficiency  tax due  to the pendency of a civil  case pending in  the  same court, but the  request  was  unheeded and the  present action  was brought.</p>
<p>The trial  court, on  February 23, 1959, rendered  decision holding Ordinance No. 3628 null and void following its  ruling  in some previous  cases  wherein it held that said ordinance being a tax measure adopted for the purpose  of raising revenue is  beyond the power of the City of Manila to enact.  Accordingly,  it dismissed the  complaint without  costs.</p>
<p>The City of Manila is now  appealing from said decision assigning  as main error  the finding of  the trial court that Ordinance No. 3628 is invalid  for being a tax measure  which cannot be  enacted by said  city.</p>
<p>In Uy Ha vs. The City Mayor, et al., 108 Phil., 400; 58 Off. Gaz.,  (37)  5997, this Court held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Since  Ordinance No.  3628  seeks  to  regulate and license  the operation of 'pinball machines' within the City  of  Manila  upon payment of an annual license of P300.00 for each 'pinball machine' the same is <em>ultra vires</em>, it being  an exercise of power not granted by  law  to  the  intervenor. As already  stated,  those devices are prohibited by law  and as  such  are not subject  to  regulation. The  attempt,  therefore, on the part of the  intervenor to collect the sum of P4,620.00 as unpaid license fees under  said  ordinance cannot be entertained."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It, therefore, appears that  Ordinance  No. 3628 is <em>ultra vires,</em> not  because it is a tax  measure, but because it was enacted beyond the  power granted  by law  to the  City  of Manila.  Hence,  any  attempt to collect any license  fee under said ordinance is illegal.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.  J.,  Bengzon,  Padilla, Labrador,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.  L., Barrera,  Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
