				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">According to the appellant the facts are these: 
  <blockquote>"On March 1, 1938, the plaintiff sold a house and lot 
situated at Gandara street, Binondo, Manila, registered under his name 
in the Registry of Deeds of Manila (Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
49040) to the herein defendant O Po Poe, married to Yu Kimting, both 
Chinese citizens for the price of P32,000.00; that by virtue of the said
 sale, a new transfer certificate of title No. 5354 was issued to the 
herein defendants; that at the time of the sale, neither of the parties 
was aware that the same was prohibited by the Constitution the parties 
having entered into the transaction in good faith, and that it was only 
after the promulgation of the Krivenko decision that they learned for 
the first time of such Constitutional prohibition; that at the time of 
the sale in 1938 the property sold consisted of a lot and improvements 
of strong materials, which improvements were totally destroyed in the 
battle of liberation and that at the present time there stands on the 
same lot a house of the 'barong-barong type; that the assessed value of 
the house and lot in 1938 was P10,000.00 and P14,016.00, respectively; 
and that the plaintiff is willing and ready to return the purchase price
 of P32,000.00, even without the improvements, upon reconveyance to him 
of the property in question"</blockquote> 
  <p>Alleging that under our Krivenko decision the defendants could not 
lawfully continue owning the property because they are and were Chinese 
citizens, the appellant filed this action in the Manila court of first 
instance for reconveyance of the real estate he had sold in 1938.  That 
court absolved the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed in due time 
and form.</p>
  <p>  In view of our decision in Rellosa <i>v.</i> Gaw Chee Hun, G. R. 
L-1411, promulgated September 29, 1953 and Caoile <i>v.</i> Yu Chiao, G.
 R. L-4068, (Sept. 29, 1953), (copies of which will be given the 
parties) we must hold that although the sale is null and void, the 
plaintiff may not recover his land.  The fact that both parties to the 
contract did not know the law, does not alter the situation.</p>
  <p>  The appealed decision will be affirmed without costs.</p>
  <p><i>Paras, C. J., Tuason, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador,
 JJ.,</i> concur.<br>
    <i>Padilla, J.,</i> no part.</p>
  <p>    <em>Pablo, M</em>., disidente: Disiento por las mismas razones 
que expuse en mis disidencias en las causas de Rellosa <i>contra</i> Gaw
 Chee Hun, G. R. No. L-1411, (Sept. 29, 1953), y Caoile <i>contra</i> Yu
 Chiao Peng, G. R. No. L-4068, (Sept. 29, 1953). </p>
  <p>    <em>Reyes, J</em>., dissenting: 
        The sale in question being forbidden by the Constitution, the 
vendor is entitled to a rescission.  As I stated in my dissent in the 
case of Dionisio Rellosa <i>vs.</i> Gaw Chee Hun, G. R. No. L-1411, the 
in <i>pari delicto</i> rule does not apply to contracts forbidden by the
 Constitution and therefore against public policy. </p>
