				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the first division of the People's Court 
finding the appellant, Agripino Bautista, guilty of treason and sentencing him 
to suffer <em>reclusión perpetua</em> and to pay a fine of ten thousand pesos, 
with costs. 
<p>The information charges two counts, namely: (1) On December 26, 1942, the 
appellant, being an enemy agent, informer and spy, caused the arrest to Aguilino 
Inocencio and Remedios Tello — because of the latter's guerrilla activities — 
and their confinement and torture in the Far Eastern University Garrison 
resulting in the disability for labor of Remedios Tello and in the death of 
Aquilino Inoceneio. (2) From December, 1944, to the year 1945, the appellant was 
a Makapili. </p>
<p>The People's Court held that appellant's membership in the Makapili 
organization was not proved by the necessary two witnesses. Yet, ruling that the 
connection was established by appellant's admission Exhibit "A" made before the 
CIC on March 2, 1945, said court took the same into account merely as an act of 
adherence to the enemy. In the view adopted by us regarding the overt act 
alleged under the first count, it is unnecessary to inquire into the sufficiency 
of appellant's admission (Exhibit "A"). </p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the appellant was instrumental in the arrest of 
Remedios Tello and Aquilino Inocencio, and if it had been conclusively proved 
that the appellant was motiviated by their guerrilla activities, conviction 
would prosper. Upon a review of the evidence, however, we are inclined to 
believe that the appellant made the complaint that led to the arrest of Remedios 
and Aquilino solely for the purpose of apprehending the assailants of his 
brother, Isidro Bautista, who was shot on December 25, 1942 in the vicinity of 
Remedios' house. The following facts are too obvious to be ignored: (1) When 
Benjamin Duarte, son of Remedios, was arrested in the evening of said day by 
Filipino detectives, he was brought to the police station at the City Hall. (2) 
The arrest of Remedios Tello and Aquilino Inocencio on December 26, 1942, was 
effected also by Filipino law agents, unaccompanied by any Japanese. (3) The 
appellant had no participation whatsoever in the alleged torture of Benjamin 
Duarte at the City Hall and of Remedios Tello and Aquilino Inocencio at the Far 
Eastern University Garrison. (4) There is no conclusive showing that Remedios 
and Aquilino were in fact guerrillas. </p>
<p>If the latter had been denounced for their alleged connection with the 
resistance movement, the Japanese would undoubtedly have personally conducted 
the raid in their house. The fact that Benjamin Duarte was arrested by Filipino 
detectives and brought to and investigated in the City Hall, negatives the idea, 
or at least engenders a doubt, that the appellant made a complaint directly to 
the Japanese authorities about the guerrilla connections of Benjamin, Remedios 
or Aquilino. It is not improbable that the Japanese, who maintained their own 
eyes and ears in almost all government offices, came to meddle only in the 
course of the investigation of Benjamin Duarte by the Manila police and that, as 
then usual, they tried to connect every disturbance of peace in Manila and 
elsewhere to their favorite theme — underground movement, — with the result that 
when Remedios Tello and Aquilino Inocencio were arrested the next day, December 
26, 1942, the Manila police agents were under direction from the Japanese to 
bring them to the Far Eastern University Garrison for questioning, something 
over which the appellant had no control. Upon the other hand, it was very 
natural for the appellant to notify the police of the attempt against his 
brother's life and to suspect that Remedios or her son Benjamin knew something 
about it, since it is not disputed that the shot that hit appellant's brother 
came from the direction or vicinity of the house of Remedios. </p>
<p>As there is absolutely no direct proof that the appellant had ever known 
Remedios or her son Benjamin to be in fact guerrillas or at least sympathetic to 
the underground work, the theory of the prosecution becomes the more 
untenable.</p>
<p>In other words, we shall be charitable enough towards the prosecution if we 
state that the evidence gives rise to two probabilities, one consistent with 
appellant's innocence and another indicative of his guilt. Consequently, that 
which is favorable to the accused should be considered. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed judgment is hereby reversed and the appellant 
acquitted, with costs <em>de oficio</em>. So s ordered. </p><em>Feria, Perfecto, 
Bengzon,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.</em> concur. </div>
