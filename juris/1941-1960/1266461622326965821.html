				G.R. No. L-1980, May 25, 1949</h4>
				<H3>CIPRIANO SEVILLA, PETITIONER, VS. CEFERINO DE LOS SANTOS AND DOMINGO CUENTA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In an action for illegal detainer filed in the justice of the 
peace court of Mangatarem, Pangasinan, a decision was rendered in favor of the 
plaintiff (herein respondent Domingo Cuenta) and against the defendant (herein 
petitioner Cipriano Sevilla), but no judgment for any rental was awarded. This 
decision was appealed by the petitioner to the Court of First Instance of 
Pangasinan wherein respondent Domingo Cuenta moved for the issance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction prohibiting the petitioner and his agents form 
cultivating and planting he parcels of land dexribed in the complaint and form 
gathering any crop that may exist thereon. This motion was granted and, upon the 
filing of a bond by the respondent Domingo Cuenta, the corresponding writ of 
prliminayr injuction was issue but, as alleged by herein petitioner, the 
respondent juge explained that said injuction "does not command the petitioner 
herein to pull out his house and leave the land."
<p align="justify">In the present petition for certiorari, the petitioenr alleges 
that the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan acted 
without or in excess of his jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion in 
issuing the above-mentioned writ of injunction.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition should be granted. Under section 3 of Rule of 
Court 72, the court may grant preliminary injuction, in accordance with the 
provisions of Rule 60, to prevent the defendant from committing further acts of 
dispossession against the plaintiff; and it was held that said preliminary 
injunction may be issued only in forcible entry proceedings, but not in an 
action of unlawful detainer. (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 2nd 
edition, Vol. II, p. 251, citing Piit vs. De Lara and Velez, 58 Phil., 765.)</p>
<p align="justify">As the action in the case at bar is one for unlawful detainer 
originating from the justice of the peace court and retaining the same nature 
during the pendency of the appeal in the Court of First Instance, the respondent 
judge had no power to issue the writ of preliminary injunction now complained 
of.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition for certiorari will therefore be, as the same is 
hereby, granted and the order of the respondent judge of July 21, 1947, entered 
in civil case No. 9842, as well as the writ of preliminary injunction issued in 
the same case on September 12, 1947, are set aside. So ordered, with costs 
against the respondent Domingo Cuenta.</p> <i>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
