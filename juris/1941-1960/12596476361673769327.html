				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition&nbsp; for prohibition&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by Jose&nbsp; U. Ochate, Mayor of the municipality of&nbsp; Clarin, province of Misamis&nbsp; Occidental against the Provincial Governor therein, Diego H. Ty Deling or his successor,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the town Vice Mayor, Tomas&nbsp; Torres of the same&nbsp; municipality, praying that the&nbsp; said respondents be&nbsp; prohibited from proceeding in the administrative charges against&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; and&nbsp; to declare unlawful and&nbsp; without authority of law, the order of respondent Governor suspending&nbsp; him&nbsp; from&nbsp; office pending&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Provincial Board.<br><br>The uncontroverted facts are as follows:<br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; U.&nbsp; Ochate is the incumbent municipal mayor of Clarin,&nbsp; Misamis Occidental, while respondents Diego H. Ty Deling and Tomas Torres are the incumbent provincial governor and vice-mayor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said municipality,&nbsp; respectively.<br><br>In an administrative complaint dated December 18, 1957, petitioner was charged&nbsp; before the Provincial Board of:<br><blockquote>"I. Organizing, tolerating, and participating&nbsp; in illegal&nbsp; cockfight and other&nbsp; forms of gambling;<br><br>II. Committing grave public&nbsp; scandals&nbsp; and acts unbecoming&nbsp; of public official;<br><br>III. Corruption of subordinate employees."<br></blockquote>which complaint was later amended on December 23, 1957 to include the following&nbsp; specifications:<br><blockquote>"1. Misconduct in&nbsp; Office—<br><blockquote>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That while the municipal council of&nbsp; Clarin,&nbsp; Misamis Occidental, was&nbsp; in&nbsp; session&nbsp; on August 31,&nbsp; 1956, presided by the petitioner&nbsp; as mayor,&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; abruptly&nbsp; left&nbsp; the&nbsp; said session and slapped his daughter and boxed&nbsp; his wife&nbsp; before the councilors and in the presence of numerous persons inside the municipal&nbsp; building, thereby disturbing and interrupting: the council's meeting with the ensuing commotion and&nbsp; disorder in violation of Articles 144 and 153 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That on&nbsp; and before December 29,&nbsp; 1957, the petitioner,. being a municipal mayor, organized or participated directly in illegal&nbsp; cockfights in unlicensed cockpits,&nbsp; and allowed or tolerated gambling therein.<br><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) That on the same date, the petitioner and his policemen resisted with firearms and violence and prevented the policemen of the neighboring municipality&nbsp; from arresting those&nbsp; engaged in illegal&nbsp; cockfights, instead of assisting the latter in&nbsp; performing their&nbsp; duty.<br></blockquote>2. Neglect of Duty—<br><blockquote>That the&nbsp; petitioner, knowing that illegal cockfights&nbsp; and gambling were held in his presence, maliciously refrained from instituting or causing the prosecution of the&nbsp; violators of the law thereby committing dereliction&nbsp; of&nbsp; duty as&nbsp; mayor in violation&nbsp; of Article 208 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code.<br></blockquote>3. Oppression—<br><blockquote>That he ordered&nbsp; anyone&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; policemen to accompany him to illegal&nbsp; cockpits and&nbsp; gambling, or assigned&nbsp; them as bodyguards of his mistress, or prevented them from enforcing the gambling laws,&nbsp; thereby&nbsp; depriving them of their liberty of&nbsp; action in the performance of their duties, thus&nbsp; inducing them to commit dereliction of duty, as in&nbsp; fact, two of them are now&nbsp; indicted with him for assault."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Memorandum&nbsp; for Respondents, pp. 1-2)<br></blockquote></blockquote>On the same date that the original administrative charge was filed,&nbsp; the respondent Governor issued Executive Order No. 7 suspending the petitioner from office and&nbsp; directing the latter to turn&nbsp; over the same to the respondent Vice-. Mayor.<br><br>The petitioner questions the legality of the administrative&nbsp; charges and of the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; suspension.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; his motion and filing a bond of five Hundred pesos, this Court, by resolution dated&nbsp; January&nbsp; 20, 1958, issued a preliminary prohibitory injunction.<br><br>In the mind of the Court, the pivotal issue in the whole case is the question whether or not&nbsp; the facts alleged in&nbsp; the administrative&nbsp; charge,&nbsp; as substantiated&nbsp; by affidavits&nbsp; of certain&nbsp; complainants, justify&nbsp; the administrative proceedings against petitioner&nbsp; and warrant the order of suspension of the Governor.<br><br>Section 2188 of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code provides, and we quote:<br><blockquote>"<i>Supervisory&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of provincial&nbsp; governor over municipal officers</i>.—The&nbsp; provincial governor&nbsp; shall receive&nbsp; and&nbsp; investigate complaints made under oath against municipal officers for neglect of duty, oppression, corruption or other form of maladministration of office, and conviction by&nbsp; final judgment of any crime involving moral turpitude.&nbsp; For minor delinquency, he may reprimand the offender; and if a more&nbsp; severe punishment&nbsp; seems to be&nbsp; desirable, he shall submit written charges touching the matter&nbsp; to the provincial board, furnishing&nbsp; a copy of such&nbsp; charges to the accused either personally or&nbsp; by registered mail, and&nbsp; he may in such&nbsp; case&nbsp; suspend the officer (not&nbsp; being the&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; treasurer) pending action&nbsp; by&nbsp; the board, if in his opinion the charge be one affecting the&nbsp; official integrity of the officer in&nbsp; question. Where suspension is&nbsp; thus&nbsp; effected,&nbsp; the written&nbsp; charges&nbsp; against the&nbsp; officer shall be filed with&nbsp; the board within five days."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; authority of the&nbsp; provincial governor, under&nbsp; the aforequoted section of the Code, to&nbsp; receive and investigate Complaints against municipal officials&nbsp; rests on two general grounds, and&nbsp; these&nbsp; are&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; neglect&nbsp; of duty,&nbsp; oppression, corruption or other form of maladministration of office and&nbsp; (2) conviction by final judgment of any crime involving&nbsp; moral turpitude.&nbsp; Pending action&nbsp; by&nbsp; the provincial board, the provincial governor may suspend the officer concerned&nbsp; if in his opinion the charge is&nbsp; one affecting the <i>official integrity</i>&nbsp; of the officer charged.&nbsp; Following the statutory&nbsp; construction&nbsp; that&nbsp; "a&nbsp; statute prescribing&nbsp; the grounds for which an officer may be suspended is penal in nature and should be&nbsp; strictly construed", the&nbsp; prepositional phrase&nbsp; "in office qualifies&nbsp; the&nbsp; various grounds for legal suspension."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cornejo <i>vs.</i> Naval,&nbsp; 54 Phil.,&nbsp; 809)<br><br>While&nbsp; it is primarily&nbsp; for the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; governor to determine&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; gravity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the offense&nbsp; charged would warrant&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of administrative charges&nbsp; and the&nbsp; propriety of the suspension, he&nbsp; will only have occasion to exercise&nbsp; such power where the charge is one affecting the official integrity of the officer or is connected with the&nbsp; performance of his duties&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; official. (Mondano <i>vs.</i> Silvosa, et al.,&nbsp; 97 Phil.,&nbsp; 143; 51 Off. Gaz. No. 6, p. 2884).&nbsp;&nbsp; "In office"&nbsp; indicates&nbsp; that&nbsp; the grounds mentioned in&nbsp; the law must be such as affect the officer's performance of his duties as an officer and not such as affect only his character as a private individual.&nbsp; "In such cases it is necessary 'to separate the character of the man from the&nbsp; character of the officer' " (Mechem, Public Offices and Officers, section 457, p. 290; State of Minnesota ex Rel. John G. Rockwell <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; State Board&nbsp; of Education, et al., 143 A. L. R. 503, 512-513; State ex rel. Knabb <i>vs.</i> Frater, 89 P. 2d. 1046; Opinion of the Justices, 33 N. E. 2d 275).<br><br>With these standards in mind, let us examine the administrative charges against the petitioner.&nbsp; Under the charge for&nbsp; "misconduct in office",&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; base&nbsp; the&nbsp; suspension on the mayor's having&nbsp; inflicted&nbsp; injuries&nbsp; upon his wife and daughter&nbsp; inside the municipal building and for which he was later convicted for&nbsp; slight physical injuries by the Justice of the Peace Court of Clarin;&nbsp; on&nbsp; having participated in illegal cockfighting; and in resisting arrest. As correctly maintained by the petitioner, however, such acts&nbsp; or&nbsp; omissions cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; <i>safely</i>&nbsp; said&nbsp; or&nbsp; considered to be related to the performance of his&nbsp; official&nbsp; duties and petitioner does not have to be the mayor to commit the offenses charged.&nbsp; Hence, in the case of Arsenio H. Lacson <i>vs.</i> Marciano Roque, et al., (92 Phil., 456; 49 Off. Gaz. 93, 100101),&nbsp; it&nbsp; was ruled:<br><blockquote>"Misconduct in&nbsp; office&nbsp; has&nbsp; a&nbsp; definite&nbsp; and&nbsp; well-understood legal meaning.&nbsp; By&nbsp; uniform legal&nbsp; definition,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; misconduct such&nbsp; as affects his performance of his duties as an officer and not such only as affects&nbsp; his character&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; private individual.&nbsp; In&nbsp; such cases, it has been said at&nbsp; all times, it is&nbsp; necessary to separate the character of the&nbsp; man from the character&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; officer.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Mechem,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>, section&nbsp; 457)&nbsp; 'It&nbsp; is settled that misconduct,&nbsp; misfeasance, or malfeasance warranting&nbsp; removal&nbsp; from office&nbsp; of an&nbsp; officer,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">must have direct relation&nbsp; to and be connected with the performance of&nbsp; official duties&nbsp; amounting</span> either to maladministration or willful, intentional neglect and&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; discharge the&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of the&nbsp; office * * *' (43 Am. Jur. 39, 40). To this effect is the principle laid down&nbsp; in Cornejo <i>vs.</i> Naval,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>.<br><br>"Judged&nbsp; by the&nbsp; foregoing, standard definition&nbsp; of&nbsp; misconduct in office, the alleged&nbsp; libel imputed to the suspended Mayor was not such misconduct even&nbsp; if the term 'misconduct in office' be taken&nbsp; in&nbsp; its broadest sense.&nbsp; The radio broadcast in which the objectionable utterances were made&nbsp; had nothing&nbsp; or very little to do with&nbsp; petitioner's official&nbsp; functions and&nbsp; duties&nbsp; as mayor.&nbsp; It was not&nbsp; done by&nbsp; virtue or under color&nbsp; of authority.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was not any wrongful&nbsp; official&nbsp; act, or omission to perform a&nbsp; duty of public concern, tacitly or expressly annexed to his&nbsp; position.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; can it be&nbsp; said that Mayor Lacson committed&nbsp; an abuse or took advantage of his office.&nbsp;&nbsp; One does not have to be&nbsp; a mayor to make those remarks or to&nbsp; talk on the radio. The use of the radio is a privilege open to anyone who would allow for reasons of his own.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The mere circumstance that&nbsp; the broadcast was transmitted from the City Hall instead of the radio&nbsp; station did not alter the situation. It is the character of the remarks and their immediate relation to the&nbsp; office that are of 'paramount&nbsp; consideration</span>. It is our considered opinion that the&nbsp; petitioner acted as a private individual and&nbsp; should be&nbsp; made to answer&nbsp; in his private capacity if&nbsp; he&nbsp; committed&nbsp;&nbsp; any breach of propriety&nbsp; or&nbsp; law."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The records fail to indicate that, in the acts complained of,&nbsp; the petitioner was motivated by any official considerations; on the contrary,&nbsp; it appears that it was&nbsp; more for personal reasons that he performed the acts and&nbsp; omissions complained of.<br><br>Of course, abetting gambling by the&nbsp; mayor within his territorial jurisdiction is an&nbsp; infringement of his official oath to compel&nbsp; obedience to the laws and&nbsp; may&nbsp; therefore constitute "misconduct" or "neglect of duty" (which brings us&nbsp; to the charge of "neglect&nbsp; of duty"), but where, as in this case, the&nbsp; alleged violation of&nbsp; gambling laws occurred within another municipality (barrio Casilac,&nbsp; municipality of&nbsp; Tudela, Misamis Occidental), it is too&nbsp; far fetched to say that in&nbsp; organizing,&nbsp; tolerating&nbsp; and participating in gambling thereat, petitioner went&nbsp; beyond his personal and private&nbsp; life&nbsp; and&nbsp; committed&nbsp; a&nbsp; wrongful conduct&nbsp; that affected, interrupted or&nbsp; interfered with the&nbsp; performance of&nbsp; his&nbsp; official duties as mayor of Clarin.<br><br>Neither can the charge of "oppression" be substantiated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; records&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; particularly the&nbsp; affidavit of one Nasciancino Jalalon and the unsworn letter&nbsp; and&nbsp; affidavit of Teodora&nbsp; M.&nbsp; Ochate.&nbsp; "Oppression" has been denned as&nbsp; "an act of cruelty, severity, unlawful exaction, domination, or excessive&nbsp; use of authority"&nbsp;&nbsp; (United States&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Deaver,&nbsp; 14 Fed. 495).&nbsp; The charges made&nbsp; seems to be too superficial to meet&nbsp; the standard fixed in the above definition.&nbsp; It is noticeable that no complaint or&nbsp; written statement was ever made or at least shown in the&nbsp; records by&nbsp; those alleged to have been oppressed by the petitioner.<br><br>The justification&nbsp; of administrative charges under section 2188 of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code is&nbsp; not based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; sufficiency&nbsp; of the complaint&nbsp; as appearing on its surface&nbsp; or form, but must be judged&nbsp; by its substance. In&nbsp; a way, the delay of the provincial governor (for almost a&nbsp; year)&nbsp; in&nbsp; filing the&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; charges&nbsp; against petitioner indicates the non-substantiality or non-sufficiency of&nbsp; the charges.<br><br>Petitioner was accused and convicted of slight physical injuries which did not involve moral&nbsp; turpitude;&nbsp; and&nbsp; although there are other pending criminal&nbsp; charges against him, e.g., for illegal cockfighting and Assault upon Agents of Authority, he&nbsp; does&nbsp; not appear&nbsp; to have been finally convicted thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts, standing alone, cannot therefore be&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of administrative&nbsp; charges&nbsp; against petitioner.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, in considering that the charges filed do not constitute misconduct or maladministration of office, the writ of prohibition&nbsp; is granted&nbsp; and respondent Governor of Misamis Occidental is prohibited from proceeding further with&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation of&nbsp; the charges&nbsp; filed against petitioner Jose U. Ochate, as well as from enforcing the order for his suspension.&nbsp;&nbsp; The writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; heretofore&nbsp; issued&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; permanent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against respondent&nbsp; Diego H.&nbsp; Ty Deling.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
