				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for a writ of certiorari was filed to set aside an order of 
preliminary injunction issued by the Court of First Instance of Baguio in the 
<em>quo warranto</em> proceedings instituted in said Court (Case No. 465), by 
respondent Dr. Andres A. Angara, against petitioner herein Josefina A. 
Gorospe.
<p>It appears that respondent Dr. Andres Angara was appointed the City Health 
Officer of the City of Baguio, and his appointment was confirmed on April 29, 
1947. While discharging his duties as such, said respondent applied on October 
21, 1950, and was granted, on May 15, 1953, a PHILCUSA-FOA (MSA) training grant 
to study and specialize in the United States. He signed a Training Grant 
Agreement to conform to all rules and regulations prescribed by the Philippine 
Council for United States Aid and Foreign Operations Administration, and to 
render upon his return no less than 2 years' service to the Government of the 
Republic of the Philippines for every year of training abroad. Thereafter, 
respondent Angara left for the United States, and vacated temporarily his post 
as City Health Officer of Baguio; and the petitioner Dr. Josefina Gorospe, 
Medical Officer of the Baguio Health Department, was designated Acting City 
Health Officer of Baguio. </p>
<p>Dr. Angara returned to the Islands on August 26, 1954. Before his arrival on 
August 10, 1954, the United States Foreign Operation Mission to the Philippines 
(FOA) sent, to the Secretary of Health a "justification" regarding assignments 
of the trainees under the grant, in order to make "the best use of the special 
training" they had received. With particular reference to respondent Angara, the 
"justification" stated that "he is well equipped to act as Technical Assistant 
to the Department of Health in all matters relating to Tuberculosis." (Petition, 
Annexes G and H). Pursuant to this recommendation, Dr. Angara upon his return 
was verbally instructed by the Secretary of Health not to reassume the office of 
City Health Officer of Baguio, to take a week's vacation leave, and to await 
assignment under the PHILCUSA-FOA agreement. Respondent was appraised of the 
recommendation made in his case, and he objected to the same; then, contrary to 
instructions, he returned to Baguio and took over the office from petitioner 
Gorospe who, unaware of the instructions of the Secretary of Health, raised no 
objection.</p>
<p>On September 14, 1954, the Mayor of Baguio, after a telephone conversation 
with the Secretary.of Health and receipt of a telegram that Dr. Angara had been 
instructed not to assume his old position and that the Department of Health 
contended Dr. Gorospe was still acting City, Health Officer, informed Dr. Angara 
that the salary as City Health Officer would be paid to Dr. Gorospe, and 
suggested that the matter be taken up with the Secretary.</p>
<p>Summoned to Manila for a conference, Dr. Angara directed petitioner Dr. 
Gorospe to take up routine matters in his absence. But Dr. Gorospe, under the 
authority of the Secretary, reassumed office as Acting City Health Officer and 
issued a memorandum to the personnel of the City Health Department to that 
effect.</p>
<p>In Manila, the Secretary of Health advised respondent on September 17, 1954, 
that he would be given a position as Technical Assistant to the Department of 
Health (Answer , p. 55) and on the same day, Department Order No. 167, s. 1954, 
was issued, whereby respondent Dr. Angara</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * is hereby detailed effective immediately to the Division of 
Tuberculosis, Department of Health, to assist the chief of the Division in the 
planning, organization and implementation of the activities provided for under 
Republic Act No. 1136. This detail shall continue until further 
orders."</p></blockquote>
<p>Evidently laboring under the impression that he had been ousted from the post 
of City Health Officer of Baguio, respondent Angara returned thither and on 
September 20, 1954 commenced <em>quo warranto</em> proceedings against 
petitioner Gorospe, the Mayor, the Treasurer, and the Auditor of the City of 
Baguio, alleging usurpation by petitioner of the functions of the office of City 
Health Officer, and praying for the issuance of a preliminary writ of 
injunction. The answer opposed the preliminary injunction and pleaded Dr 
Angara's detail under Department Order No. 167, previously quoted; Dr. Angara's 
PHILCUSA-FOA fellowship contract; that Dr. Gorospe in discharging the duties of 
Acting City Health Officer of Baguio was merely obeying the lawful orders of the 
Secretary of Health; and that the latter was not a party to the proceedings.</p>
<p>On October 11, 1954, the respondent Judge granted a preliminary writ of 
injunction upon the filing of a bond for P3,000; and a motion to reconsider this 
order having been denied, petitioner Gorospe resorted to this Court, which 
ordered a stay of the proceedings.</p>
<p>It is plain from the text of the Department Order No. 167, Series 1954, that 
respondent Dr. Angara has not been suspended, removed or ousted from his 
position as City Health Officer of Baguio, but was merely detailed to serve 
temporarily in Manila, in the Division of Tuberculosis , Department of Health, 
as Technical Assistant therein. Such being the case, our decisions in Santos 
<em>vs</em>. Mallare, (48 Off. Gaz., (5) 1787) ; Jover <em>vs</em>. Borra, (49 
Off. Gaz., (7) 2765), Lacson <em>vs</em>. Romero, (47 Off. Gaz., 1778-); and 
Lacson <em>vs</em>. Roque, (49 Off. Gaz., (1) 93) are not applicable. The detail 
of respondent Dr. Angara, under Department of Health Order No. 167, is a mere 
temporary arrangement which does not have, and is not intended to have the 
effect of removing or suspending said respondent from the position he now holds. 
Said detail, moreover, is supported by the contractual commitments assumed by 
said respondent under the Training Grant Agreement that he voluntarily signed, 
promising to render not less than two years service to the Government of the 
Republic of the Philippines upon his return from training abroad.</p>
<p>The provision in the order in question, that respondent Angara's detail 
"shall continue until further, orders", can not be construed as an indefinite 
assignment, since respondent's contract to serve the Government of the Republic 
limits his service to two years and not more. Hence, the phrase adverted to is 
to be understood as merely referring to the particular detail to the 
Tuberculosis Division, and not to the duration thereof.</p>
<p>Considerable effort is made for the respondent Dr. Angara to show that his 
detail to the Tuberculosis Division is not in line with the special training he 
has received under the grant. Assuming that this is a. matter that could 
properly be determined in these proceedings, it should be enough to point out 
that the agreement subscribed by said respondent (Petition, Annex F) does not 
authorize him to insist that his own discretion or judgment should override that 
of his hierarchical superior , the Secretary of Health. The revised "Memorandum 
to the Agencies of the Philippine Government for the Sending of Filipino 
Technicians abroad under the ECA "Technical Assistance Programme" attached to 
said respondent's answer as its Annex 2, and which he admits to set forth the 
conditions applicable to his application for specialized training, (Answer, par. 
7) contains the following provisions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"8. <em>Obligations undertaken by participants and by the 
Government</em>.—Each participant chosen within the government service is 
required to sign an agreement in which, among other things, he binds himself to 
render not less than two years' service to the Government of the Republic of the 
Philippines upon his return, for every year of training abroad, any period of 
training, study, or observation being computed as a minimum of one year for this 
purpose. The government undertakes to restore the participant to the position 
most advantageous to the government upon the completion of his training 
abroad."</p></blockquote>
<p>What position should be deemed "most advantageous to the government" for the 
respondent to occupy is a question to be decided by the representatives of the 
government , and not by respondent Dr. Angara. Respondent's opinion as to his 
qualifications and capacity may not necessarily coincide with that of the 
government's representatives , and in such event, the decision of the latter 
must control, since the object is to attain the maximum benefit for the 
government itself, not for the respondent. Even if a party were a reliable 
<em>judex in sua causa</em>, the government can not be denied the right to 
determine, experimentally or otherwise, in what position it could make use of 
respondent's services to the best advantage of the service and of the public. Be 
that as it may, the undertaking to place the respondent in the position most 
advantageous to the government for "the best use of the special training" 
received by him necessarily carries with it the duty of respondent Dr. Angara to 
comply with such assignment, even if it does not suit his personal ideas or 
convenience. If the government's undertaking was a duty on its part, respondent 
had no right to prevent the discharge of such duty.</p>
<p>Respondent Dr. Angara has not shown, directly or indirectly , that his detail 
to the Tuberculosis Division was in any way due to improper motives or purposes, 
or that it was made in abuse of discretion or would subject him to indignity or 
humiliation, or is otherwise incompatible with his obligations under the 
Training Agreement. The undeniable importance of tuberculosis control for the 
country at large sufficiently justifies the detail, specially since it is in 
line with the recommendation of the authorities who exercised supervision of the 
training grants. It is not amiss here to call attention to section 951 of the 
Revised Administrative Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 951. <em>Command of services of medical employees in general</em>— 
Subject to the approval of the proper head of Department, the Director of Health 
may require the services, without additional compensation, of any medical 
officer or employee in the Government service."</p></blockquote>
<p>And if the Director of Health can exercise this power, <em>a fortiori</em>, 
his superior, the Secretary of Health, may do so, and call upon respondent to 
serve.</p>
<p>We have held in Rodriguez vs. Del Rosario,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> 49 Off. Gaz. (No. 12) p. 5427, that a 
public officer designated temporarily to act as technical assistant has the 
right to renounce such designation and return to his official post. Said ruling 
does not apply to the case of the respondent Dr. Angara, because the latter, by 
his training agreement, has consented to submit for two years to the designation 
made by the proper government representatives. His claim that the agreement is 
void in so far as it binds him to serve away from the city of Baguio is 
untenable, for petitioner is now in estoppel to urge the nullity of his training 
agreement after having taken advantage thereof . It appears neither fit nor 
seemly that this respondent, after voluntarily applying for and obtaining 
special training advantages upon his promise to serve the national government 
for two years upon his return, should now endeavor to repudiate those very 
promises in consideration whereof he was granted and received the advantages he 
now enjoys. It is well to note in this connection that the City of Baguio is not 
complaining against the temporary loss of respondent's services; in truth, its 
authorities were made by him defendant in the <em>quo warranto</em> proceedings 
interposed against Dr. Gorospe.</p>
<p>We can not agree that respondent's training contract is against public policy 
in so far as it authorizes the Department of Health to detail him to another 
position. Public policy requires, as we have repeatedly held, that officials in 
the classified or unclassified civil service be not removed, suspended or 
indefinitely transferred except <em>with their consent</em> or for sufficient 
cause. But this rule aims primarily to protect the tenure of public officials, 
to guard them from pressure or imposition, and they may voluntarily relinquish 
the protection, at least for a limited period, as this respondent has done 
through his training agreement. "There is no sanctity in such a claim of 
constitutional right as prevents its being waived as any other claim of right 
may be" (Wall <em>vs</em>. Parrot Silver &amp; Copper Co., 244 U. S. 407, 61 L. 
Ed. 1229). "A person may, by his act or omission to act, waive a right he might 
otherwise have under the Constitution". (Pierce <em>vs</em>. Somerset Railway 
171 U. S. 641, 43 L. Ed. 317).</p>
<p>It follows from all the foregoing that the detail made by Health Department 
Order No. 167, Series 1954, was valid and in consonance with the terms of the 
agreement voluntarily executed by the respondent Dr. Angara, and that the 
temporary occupancy of his position, in ah acting capacity, by petitioner Dr. 
Gorospe, did not constitute usurpation or unlawful withholding of the office of 
City Health Officer of Baguio. As all the essential facts were laid before the 
respondent Judge (as evidenced by the copies of the pleadings in the <em>quo 
warranto</em> case in the Court below) and it could not be hidden from him that 
no <em>prima facie</em> case of <em>quo warranto</em> existed; that the case 
involved the validity of the Department Order No. 167, and that, therefore, the 
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction practically nullified said order 
without the Department Secretary being made a party, and being given a chance to 
be heard, we have arrived at the conclusion that the issuance of said writ was 
done in grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we hold: (1) that a temporary detail of a public officer in 
the civil service to another position, pursuant to contract voluntarily entered 
into by the officer, is neither a removal, suspension, or transfer in violation 
of the Constitution, in the absence of showing of manifest abuse of discretion 
or that the detail is due to some improper motive or purpose; (2) that subject 
to the same restrictions, where the government undertakes to place the officer 
upon completion of his special training abroad to the position most advantageous 
to the government, the selection of the position is in the discretion of the 
government representatives; and (3) that where the pleadings and facts before 
the Court of First Instance disclose no <em>prima facie</em> case for <em>quo 
warranto</em>, and all the proper parties are not before the Court, a 
preliminary writ of injunction restraining the respondent from discharging the 
duties of the office is improper, as issued in abuse of discretion and excess of 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ of certiorari prayed for is granted, and the writ of 
preliminary injunction issued by the Court of First Instance of Baguio in its 
Civil Case No. 465 is annulled and set aside, with costs against respondent Dr. 
Andres A. Angara.</p>

<p align="center"><strong><em>DISSENTING OPINION</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>MONTEMAYOR, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>I regret my inability to agree to the interpretation given by the majority to 
paragraph 8 of the training grant agreement signed by respondent Dr. Angara 
before he left for the United States for study under a PHILCUSA-FOA (MSA) 
training grant. For purposes of reference 1 am reproducing that portion of the 
training grant agreement , to,wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"8. <em>Obligations undertaken by participants and by the 
Government</em>.—Each participant chosen within the government service is 
required to sign an agreement in which, among other things, he binds himself to 
render not less than two years service to the Government of the Republic of the 
Philippines upon his return, for every year of training abroad, any period of 
training, study, or observation being computed as a minimum of one year for this 
purpose. The government undertakes to restore the participant to the position 
most advantageous to the government upon the completion of his training 
abroad."</p></blockquote>
<p>The facts in the case are correctly stated in the majority opinion, namely, 
that respondent. Dr. Angara was in the year 1950 a duly appointed City Health 
Officer of the City of Baguio; that he applied for and was later granted in 1953 
a training grant by the PHILCUSA-FOA (MSA) to study and specialize in the United 
States; that he signed the training grant agreement, paragraph 8 of which is 
reproduced above, to conform to all rules and regulations prescribed by the 
Philippine Council for United States Aid and Foreign Operations Administration, 
and to render upon his return no less than two years' service to the Government 
of the Republic of the Philippines for every year of training abroad; that 
thereafter Angara left for the United States and <em>temporarily vacated</em> 
his post as City Health Officer of Baguio and that Dr. Josefina Gorospe , a 
Medical Officer in the Baguio Health Department was designated Acting City 
Health Officer of Baguio; that upon Angara's return he took over his old office 
of City Health Officer of Baguio from Dr. Gorospe; that the Secretary of Health 
objected to his returning to his old post and issued Department Order No. 167 
detailing him, until further orders, with the Division of Tuberculosis, 
Department of Health, in Manila; that Angara declined that detail because he 
wanted to stay in his old post in Baguio and he commenced quo warranto 
proceedings against Dr. Gorospe and obtained an order of preliminary injunction 
from the Court of First Instance of Baguio, which the majority now annuls and 
sets aside as having been improperly issued.</p>
<p>The theory of the majority is that in signing the training grant agreement 
and in taking advantage of the PHILCUSA-FOA (MSA) training grant to study in the 
United States, respondent Angara bound himself upon his return to the 
Philippines to render not less than 2 years service to the Government of the 
Republic of the Philippines for every years' training abroad, in any capacity, 
position, or department that the Government chooses to detail him, although the 
majority admits that under the doctrine laid down by this Court in several 
cases, among them those of Lacson <em>vs</em>. Romero, 47 Off. Gaz., 1778, and 
Santos <em>vs</em>. Mallari, 48 Off. Gaz., (5) p. 1787, and Rodriguez 
<em>vs</em>. Del Rosario, 49 Off. Gaz., No. 12 p. 5427, a civil service employee 
like respondent Angara may not be removed, transferred, or detailed to another 
place or position without his consent.</p>
<p>It is well to remember that Dr. Angara in signing the training grant 
agreement and in going to the United States to study, never vacated his post as 
City Health Officer of Baguio. The majority opinion itself says that in going to 
the United States Angara merely vacated temporarily said post. Consequently 
unless he had bound himself upon his return to the Philippines to accept any 
transfer or detail to another post, in any place, he had every right to go back 
to his old.post in Baguio. It is true that he undertook to render not less than 
2 year's service in the Government for every one year training abroad, but said 
service of two years could well be rendered in his old post because it is just 
the same service to the Government.</p>
<p>Let us now examine section 8 of the training grant agreement and see whether 
as claimed by the majority, the respondent had undertaken or had obligated 
himself upon his return to the Philippines to be transferred or detailed from 
his post in Baguio to another place; in other words, whether or not he had 
signed away his right to resume his old post upon his return to the Philippines. 
The majority evidently banks on the last sentence of paragraph 8 which reads: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The government undertakes to restore the participant to the position 
most advantageous to the government upon the completion of his training abroad." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>It will be seen that the whole question depends upon the meaning and 
interpretation of the word "undertakes". In my opinion, in that sentence above 
reproduced, the Government merely promised or obligated itself to do something. 
It is not a right for but rather an obligation of the Government. According to 
Webster's New International Dictionary, the word Undertake means "to take upon 
oneself solemnly or expressly; to lay oneself under obHgation * * * to 
guarantee, promise * * * to enter into an engagement * * * to pledge * * * to 
give a promise or guaranty or assume responsibility". In none of these 
definitions is there any idea of right; rather there is every idea of obligation 
or promise. The very sub-heading of paragraph 8—"<em>Obligations</em> undertaken 
by participants and by the Government," the very word "obligation" is used. As 
already stated, all that Angara promised and undertook is that upon his return 
to the Philippines he would render service to the Government 2 years for every 
year of training abroad. That, he was willing and ready to perform—he assumed 
his old post in Baguio and was prepared to render service to the Government. He 
never promised to render said service in any other capacity, position, or detail 
away from and other than his old post. If the last sentence of paragraph 8 had 
said that the Government <em>reserves</em> the right to transfer or detail the 
participant (Angara) to the position most advantageous to the Government because 
of his special training abroad, it would be different because that reservation 
would mean a <em>right</em>, far different from the <em>obligation</em> assumed 
by the Government, as the sentence is actually worded.</p>
<p>Supposing that the detail now being imposed by the Government, instead of 
being in Manila, were in some far off isolated place like Batanes which would be 
quite unpleasant, inconvenient, and undesirable to Jhe respondent and wholly 
unsuitable to his health because he and his family had been accustomed to the 
climate of Baguio? Under the theory of the majority he would have to accept the 
detail anyway whether he liked it or not, whether it would mean separation from 
his family or whether his health would suffer by it; or else resign and answer 
for any penalty or damages the Government may impose upon him, and all and only 
because he promised before his going to the United States to serve the 
Government 2 years for every one year of training abroad. If that were the 
correct interpretation of the undertaking made by any government official or 
employee who is sent abroad, then this arrangement or scheme would be a good and 
expedient way of transfering or even removing government officials and employees 
because upon their return to the Islands after their training abroad, they could 
be detailed to a post so undesirable and so inconvenient that there is no 
recourse or alternative left to the employee but to resign.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that when a person accepts a government position, the 
duties thereof and the place of station are important considerations to be taken 
into account. Perhaps, respondent Angara in accepting his original position in 
Baguio, considered that place for purposes of residence as desirable and 
suitable to his health and that of his family. According to our rulings already 
stated, except for cause he may not be transferred or detailed from that place 
without his consent. Here, he is being detailed away from Baguio against his 
consent just because he promised, upon his return, to render service to the 
Government, without specifying where. Without such specification, it is to be 
presumed that that service would be rendered in his old post in Baguio. The 
undertaking and promise made by the Government to restore him to a position most 
advantageous to the Government, as I have already stated, is not a right but an 
obligation, a guarantee or pledge which is up to the participant (respondent 
Angara) to enforce or not. The distinction between an obligation and a right is 
too clear to require explanation. If the government in giving a government 
official or employee a chance to study abroad desires and intends to detail him 
upon his return to any position, place, department or capacity it chooses, it 
should make that point clear in the contract or grant agreement so that those 
accepting the grant may know and decide whether or not to accept the grant.</p>
<p>It may be that respondent Angara in accepting the grant, in taking advantage 
of it and in making special studies abroad is morally obliged upon his return to 
the Philippines to render service to the Government in any capacity chosen by 
the latter, where he could make use of his special training; but here we are 
speaking and treating not of a moral obligation but a legal obligation. I want 
to give force and substance to the rule and doctrine laid down by this Court, 
protecting civil service officials and employees from being transferred or 
detailed away from their posts against their will, unless they themselves have 
previously and clearly consented to said transfer or detail.</p>
<p>I believe that the writ of preliminary injunction granted by the lower court 
was properly issued.</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>
<p><em>Writ granted.</em></p></div>
