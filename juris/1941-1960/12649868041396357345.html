				<H3>JOSE PLATON AND ROMAN CASTILLO, PETITIONERS,  VS. HON. CLAUDIO SANDOVAL, IN HIS CAPACITY AS JUDGE, COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LAGUNA, AND  INES MAILOM, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is&nbsp; an original petition for&nbsp; certiorari and mandamus to annul an order issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the respondent judge whereby the receiver appointed in civil case No. 7385 of the Court of First Instance of Laguna, entitled "Ines&nbsp; Mailom <i>vs.</i> Antonino Castillo and Roman Castillo," was discharged, and to compel the respondent judge to approve the appeal of said receiver from said order.<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that said civil case was&nbsp; instituted by Ines Mailom, one of the heirs of the deceased Servanda Mailom, to annul the sale of certain&nbsp; parcels of land made by the spouses Roman Castillo and Servanda Mailom (previous to the&nbsp; death of the latter)&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of Antonino Castillo, a brother of Roman.&nbsp; After the&nbsp; death Servanda Mailom, her husband Roman Castillo was appointed administrator of the&nbsp; estate left by her.&nbsp; The&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Jose Platon was appointed receiver of. the property in&nbsp; litigation in said civil case No.&nbsp; 7385 at the instance of&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; (now respondent) Ines Mailom.<br><br>It was also Ines Mailom who, through her attorney, moved the&nbsp; court on November 11, 1942,&nbsp; to discharge the receiver on the ground that there was no more necessity for the continuation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the receivership inasmuch&nbsp; as the defendant Antonino Castillo had renounced his claim to said property in a stipulation of facts submitted to the court on November 25,1940,land the heirs of the deceased Servanda Mailom, including the administrator Roman Castillo, had submitted a&nbsp; project of partition in the intestate proceedings of the deceased&nbsp; Servanda Mailom, case Ho. 3148&nbsp; of&nbsp; said court, which project of partition had been approved by the court. Upon&nbsp; such&nbsp; allegations, which&nbsp; the .court found&nbsp; to be true, the respondent judge granted&nbsp; the .motion, discharging the receiver and ordering him to deliver the properties under receivership to the persons entitled to receive the same in accordance with the project of partition aforementioned.<br><br>The receiver Jose Platon filed a motion to set aside said order on the grounds (1) that he had not been notified of the motion upon which the same was issued; (2) that the case in&nbsp; which he was appointed&nbsp; receiver, was&nbsp; still pending decision by&nbsp; Judge Proceso Sebastian; (3) that in the event Antonino Castillo wins the case, the receiver has to deliver to him the properties,, thereby&nbsp; rendering&nbsp; the&nbsp; project of partition useless and of no value; and&nbsp; (4) that irregularities were committed by Attorney Acuña for the plaintiff and the heirs&nbsp; of Servanda Mailom regarding&nbsp; the disposition of the properties in question after the approval of the project of partition. In a memorandum submitted by the attorney for the receiver Jose Platon in support&nbsp; of said motion, said attorney,&nbsp; who also represents the defendant-administrator Roman Castillo, said that the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; joins the&nbsp; receiver in said motion and makes it his own.<br><br>After hearing both parties upon said motion to set aside the order discharging the receiver, the respondent judge reaffirmed his finding that there was no&nbsp; necessity&nbsp; for the continuation of the receivership and denied said&nbsp; motion. Thereupon the receiver filed a notice of appeal from said order and tendered a record on appeal which the&nbsp; respondent judge disapproved on the ground that the order was interlocutory and not appealable.<br><br>With regard to the order discharging&nbsp; the receiver and terminating the receivership, we find&nbsp; no excess of jurisdiction nor grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent judge.&nbsp; The property in&nbsp; litigation and under receivership belongs to the intestate estate of the deceased <servaiida mailom,="" wife="" petitioner="" roman="" castillo.="" defendant="" antonino:="" castillo;="" who ="" is="" heir="" deceased,="" does="" claim="" ownership="" signed="" conformity="" discharge="" receiver. ="" heirs="" deceased="" have="" agreed="" upon="" partition="" property="" with="" approval="" probate="" court. ="" seems="" clear,="" therefore,="" declaration="" respond-="" ent="" there="" was ="" longer="" any ="" was="" well ="" founded. ="" any="" eventi="" it="" cannot.be="" said="" respondent="" judge="" exceeded="" jurisdiction ="" abused ="" his="" discretion="" in="" making="" such="" a="" finding.  ="" furthermore,="" receiver;="" being="" an="" officer="" and="" not="" agent="" or ="" representative ="" either="" party="" action,="" no="" legal="" interest="" or="" standing="" question="" court="" s="" determination="" that="" necessity="" for="" continuation="" of="" the="" receivership="" has="" ceased="" to="" exist.=""><br><br>It is immaterial to decide now whether the receiver was entitled to be heard on the original motion to discharge him, for the reason that he was actually heard in the&nbsp; premises when thru his attorney he filed a motion for reconsideration.<br><br>With regard to the approval of the record on appeal, we agree with the respondent judge that the order sought to be appealed from is interlocutory, and hence mandamus does not lie to compel him to&nbsp; approve and certify the record&nbsp; on appeal.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, certiorari to annul&nbsp; an order and mandamus to approve an appeal from said order are inconsistent remedies. The first is predicated on the theory that the&nbsp; second&nbsp; is unavailable;&nbsp; Having&nbsp; decided to&nbsp; pass upon the&nbsp; petition for certiorari&nbsp; oh the merits, we cannot consistently compel the approval of an appeal from the same order which&nbsp; was the object of the certiorari proceeding. The petition is denied and the orders assailed are affirmed.<br><br>With costs against the petitioners.<br><br><i>Yulo, C.J., Moran, Horrilleno</i>, and <i>Paras, JJ.</i>, concur. </servaiida></div>
