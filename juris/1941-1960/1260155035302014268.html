				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In its petition for a writ of certiorari and prohibition, the National Association, of Trade Unions, a labor organization organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines,&nbsp; prays that a writ of preliminary injunction issued by the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 33913&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; "People's Bank and Trust Co. <i>vs.</i> Association of Bank Employees, et al.," be set aside, that Hon.&nbsp; Froilan&nbsp; Bayona, be restrained, as Judge of said court, from further proceeding&nbsp; with&nbsp; the determination and&nbsp; hearing of&nbsp; said&nbsp; case, and&nbsp; that said petitioner be allowed "to prove damages as well as expenses incurred" on account of "the&nbsp; improvident&nbsp; issuance of the aforementioned writ of preliminary injunction."<br><br>The&nbsp; pertinent facts are not&nbsp; disputed.&nbsp; On September 30,&nbsp; 1957, members&nbsp; of the aforementioned&nbsp; labor organization working in the People's Bank and Trust Co., the main respondent herein,&nbsp; declared&nbsp; a&nbsp; strike and&nbsp; set&nbsp; up&nbsp; picket lines around the premises of said&nbsp; Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon thereafter, or on October 3, 1957, the latter instituted said Civil Case No. 33913&nbsp; against the Association of Bank Employeesâ€” People's Bank and Trust Co. (NATU) and several officers and employees of such&nbsp; labor&nbsp; organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bank in its complaint that the defendants had performed a number of illegal acts specified&nbsp; in said&nbsp; pleading; that said acts would&nbsp; cause&nbsp; substantial and irreparable injury to&nbsp; the Bank,&nbsp; "unless a temporary&nbsp; restraining&nbsp; order,&nbsp; without notice", were&nbsp; "immediately issued to restrain the defendants from&nbsp; committing the illegal acts above described"; that "the public officers charged with the duty to protect" its&nbsp; "property, although&nbsp; willing,&nbsp; are unable to furnish adequate"&nbsp; protection;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Bank has&nbsp; "no&nbsp; adequate remedy at law";&nbsp; and&nbsp; that this case is one cognizable by said court as held&nbsp; in&nbsp; PAFLU <i>vs.</i> Tan (99&nbsp; Phil., 854; 52 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [13]&nbsp; 5836).&nbsp; Relying upon&nbsp; these allegations in the complaint, which was sworn to, on the basis of his own "knowledge, information and&nbsp; belief," by Antonio de&nbsp; las Alas, Jr., secretary of said Bank, respondent Hon. Froilan Bayona, as Judge of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila,&nbsp; forthwith issued, on October&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1957, a writ of preliminary injunction, pertinent parts of which read:<br><blockquote>"To Asso. of Bank&nbsp; Employees-People's&nbsp; Bank &amp; Trust Co. (NATU, et al.)<br><br>Greetings:<br><br>"Complaint having been filed before this Court of First Instance of Manila in the above-entitled cause, against the defendant Association of Bank Employees,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; above mentioned, praying that a preliminary injunction be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; against said defendant restraining them from continuing the performance of certain acts mentioned in the complaint&nbsp; and more&nbsp; particularly described hereafter; upon considering said complaint and affidavit by&nbsp; plaintiff, People's Bank &amp; Trust Co., Inc. and it appearing to the satisfaction of the Court that this is a case where a writ of injunction should issue, sufficient reason having been alleged,&nbsp; and the bond required&nbsp; by&nbsp; law having been given in the sum of five thousand pesos, Philippines currency (P5,000.00), to&nbsp; the satisfaction of the&nbsp; Court:<br><br>"It is hereby ordered&nbsp; by the undersigned Judge of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance that, until&nbsp; further order, you, the said Association of Bank Employees, et al. and all your attorneys, representatives, agents,&nbsp; and any other person assisting you, refrain from engaging in mass picketing,&nbsp; violent&nbsp; picketing,&nbsp; boisterous&nbsp; picketing or&nbsp; any manner of unlawful picketing which prevents the&nbsp; free,&nbsp; normal&nbsp; and unhampered ingress into and egress from the bank's main entrance by any person;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; coercing, intimidating, molesting, harassing, embarassing, interfering&nbsp; with,&nbsp; injuring, and instilling or causing to be instilling or causing to&nbsp; be instilled fear into, the customers desiring to&nbsp; transact business with the&nbsp; bank, or any other person or persons including&nbsp; the plaintiff's employees who are now inside the bank, (<i>c</i>) preventing the free and unhampered entry into&nbsp; and removal from the Bank&nbsp; premises of any foodstuff, papers, mail-matter, clothing,&nbsp; or any&nbsp; matter whatsoever, whether in connection with the bank business or&nbsp; otherwise;&nbsp; (<i>d</i>)&nbsp; preventing the security guards&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; from&nbsp; accompanying&nbsp; or escorting any person to and from the bank; (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)&nbsp; unlawfully impeding, obstructing, hampering or interfering with the business of the bank, until further orders from this Court."&nbsp; (Annex 1.)<br></blockquote>Two (2)&nbsp; days thereafter, or on&nbsp; October 5,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; said labor organization instituted the present case against Judge Bayona and the Bank.&nbsp; In its petition, it alleged, among other things,&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent Judge&nbsp; had unlawfully&nbsp; exceeded his jurisdiction and&nbsp; committed&nbsp; a&nbsp; grave abuse of discretion in issuing the aforementioned writ of preliminary injunction and in taking cognizance of said Case No. 33913 because:&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) the same involves a labor dispute, cognizable only by the Court of Industrial Relations; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) the provisions of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 9(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 875 had been violated.<br><br>In their answer, respondents herein alleged, in substance, that the picketing by members of petitioner's organization had&nbsp; been conducted in an illegal manner; that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by&nbsp; respondent Judge was effective&nbsp; for five (5)&nbsp; days only; that the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide the issues raised&nbsp; in said Case No. 33913, pursuant to PAFLU <i>vs.</i> Tan supra, and PAFLU <i>vs.</i> Barot (99 Phil., 1008; 52&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 6544) ; that petitioner herein has a plain, adequate and speedy remedy in said Case No. 33913; that the issue raised in&nbsp; the case at bar "has become moot and academic" by&nbsp; reason of the expiration of said&nbsp; period of five (5) days, and is "no longer justiciable"; and that any question&nbsp; of damages suffered by petitioner herein in&nbsp; consequence of the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of the restraining&nbsp; order&nbsp; complained of, "should be heard and tried in said&nbsp; Civil Case No. 33913."<br><br>Although the issue between the parties in said case arose, admittedly, out of a labor dispute, this Court has already held&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; PAFLU&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Tan (<i>supra</i>), and&nbsp; PAFLU <i>vs.</i> Barot (<i>supra</i>), that&nbsp; courts of first instance&nbsp; have jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; settle&nbsp; said issue and determine whether a&nbsp; writ of preliminary or permanent injunction should be issued, inasmuch as said labor&nbsp; dispute does not affect an industry which&nbsp; is indispensable to the national interest and is so certified by the President&nbsp; (Sec. 10, Republic Act 875), and the controversy neither refers to minimum wage, under the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act 602), or to hours of employment, under the Eight-Hour Labor Law&nbsp; (Commonwealth&nbsp; Act 444), nor involves an unfair labor practice&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 5[a], Republic Act&nbsp; 875).<br><br>However, it is obvious that respondent Judge had&nbsp; exceeded his jurisdiction&nbsp; in issuing&nbsp; the restraining&nbsp; order complained of, upon the allegations of the verified complaint in said&nbsp; case No. 33913,&nbsp; without taking the testimony&nbsp; of any witness in support&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Reyes <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Tan (99 Phil., 880; 52 Off. Gaz. [14], 6187), this Court, in a unanimous decision, penned by Mr. Justice Reyes (J.B.L.),&nbsp; explicitly&nbsp; declared, more than&nbsp; a year before&nbsp; the institution of said&nbsp; Case No. 33913:<br><blockquote>"Under section&nbsp; 9(d) of Republic Act 875, an injunction&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> can be issued <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> 'upon testimony under&nbsp; oath, <span style="font-style: italic;">sufficient, if sustained, to justify the court in issuing a temporary injunction upon hearing after notice'</span>.&nbsp; In other words,<span style="font-style: italic;"> there is still necessity for a hearing at which sworn testimony for the&nbsp; applicants would be&nbsp; received,</span> and not only that, the court should be satisfied that such testimony would stand under cross-examination by the Court and be&nbsp; sufficient to overcome denial by the defendants.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">As no hearing was held in the Court below and the injunction issued on the basis&nbsp; of mere affidavits </span>submitted by respondents (petitioners-applicants&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court below), <span style="font-style: italic;">the injunction in question is&nbsp; void</span> for not&nbsp; having been issued in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act 875." (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>This view was reiterated in PAFLU <i>vs.</i> Barot (<i>supra</i>), in which,&nbsp; after quoting section 9(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) of Republic Act 875, Mr. Justice Labrador, speaking for the Court,&nbsp; used the following&nbsp; language:<br><blockquote>"Judged by the above-quoted provision, the order complained of is subject to the following objections: (1) <span style="font-style: italic;">there was no hearing of the testimonies of witnesses in open court; </span>(2) there is no finding of fact by&nbsp; the court that unlawful acts have been threatened&nbsp; and will be&nbsp; committed nor that complainant has no&nbsp; adequate remedy at law,&nbsp; and that public officers charged&nbsp; with the duty to protect complainant's property are unable&nbsp; or unwilling to furnish adequate protection."&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>With respect to respondents' allegation to the effect that the&nbsp; restraining&nbsp; order&nbsp; in&nbsp; question was effective&nbsp; for five (5)&nbsp; days only, that said order expired, therefore, on October 8, 1957, and that the question of validity o*f said order has, therefore, become "moot and academic" and is "no longer justiciable", it should be noted that the present case was instituted&nbsp; two (2) days after&nbsp; the issuance of said order and&nbsp; before the expiration&nbsp; of said&nbsp; period of five (5)&nbsp; days. Besides, the writ of&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by respondent Judge specifically&nbsp; and explicitly enjoined the defendants in Case No. 33913&nbsp; to refrain from performing the acts therein specified&nbsp; "until further orders from this Court."&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; apart from neither&nbsp; holding the hearing, nor taking the testimony&nbsp; required in section 9 (d) of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 875, respondent Judge violated the same by imposing a restraint for a longer period than that authorized by said legal provision.<br><br>At any&nbsp; rate,&nbsp; the expiration of said&nbsp; period, after the institution of the proceedings questioning&nbsp; the legality of the writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction,&nbsp; has not deterred this Court from nullifying similar orders&nbsp; in the&nbsp; past.&nbsp; Thus, referring to a temporary restraining order issued on May 10, 1955, this Court in&nbsp; a decision&nbsp; promulgated on August 31, 1956 or over&nbsp; fifteen&nbsp; (15) months later, held in PAFLU <i>vs.</i> Tan&nbsp; (<i>supra</i>):<br><blockquote>"We believe however that in order&nbsp; that an injunction may be properly issued the procedure laid down in section 9(eÂ£) of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 875&nbsp; should be&nbsp; followed and cannot be granted <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> as allowed&nbsp; by Rule 60, section 6, of the Rules of&nbsp; Court. The reason is that the&nbsp; case, involving as it does a labor dispute, comes under said section&nbsp; 9{<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; of the law.&nbsp; That procedure requires that <span style="font-style: italic;">there should be a&nbsp; hearing</span> at which&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties should be given an opportunity to&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">present witnesses</span> in support&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint and of the opposition, if any, with opportunity for cross-examination; and that the other conditions required by said section as prerequisites for the granting of relief must&nbsp; be established and&nbsp; stated in the order of the court.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Unless&nbsp; this procedure is&nbsp; followed, the proceedings would be invalid and of no effect.&nbsp; The court would then be acting in excess of its jurisdiction.</span>&nbsp; (Lauf <i>vs.</i> E. G. Shinner &amp; Co., Inc., supra.)<br><br>"It appearing&nbsp; that in the present case such procedure&nbsp; was not followed, we are&nbsp; persuaded to conclude that <span style="font-style: italic;">the order of respondent court of May 10, 1955 granting </span>the writ of injunction prayed for by plaintiff-respondent is invalid and should be nullified.<br><br>"Petition is granted.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The order of respondent court dated</span> May 10, 1955 is set aside.&nbsp; Costs against RE MA, Incorporated."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>Moreover, in United Pepsi-Cola&nbsp; Sales&nbsp; Organization <i>vs.</i> Canizares, et al., 102 Phil., 887; 55&nbsp; Off Gaz. [21], 3837 in which an <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> writ of injunction was validly issued after taking the testimony of witnesses&nbsp; under&nbsp; oath, we had the following to say:<br><blockquote>"Finally, a temporary restraining&nbsp; order issued <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span>, 'shall be effective for no longer than five days and shall be void at the expiration of said&nbsp; five days',&nbsp; according to sec.&nbsp; 9(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; of Republic Act 875.&nbsp; The order of injunction in question having been issued e<span style="font-style: italic;">x parte</span>, it<span style="font-style: italic;"> became void</span> and&nbsp; of&nbsp; no <span style="font-style: italic;">effect </span>after the fifth day of its issuance, by&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of law&nbsp; and even without&nbsp; any judicial&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp; of that&nbsp; effect&nbsp; (Reyes <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Tan,&nbsp; 52 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 14, 6197;&nbsp; Allied&nbsp; Free&nbsp; Workers&nbsp; Union <i>vs.</i> Apostol, 102 Phil., 292). <br><br>"Wherefore, the&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; certiorari is denied, <span style="font-style: italic;">but the writ of preliminary injunction, issued by the trial court on 25 April 1957, is declared no longer operative.&nbsp; No costs."</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>This notwithstanding, we&nbsp; agree with the&nbsp; respondents herein that the&nbsp; determination of&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of damages sustained by petitioner&nbsp; herein, if any, on account of the restraining order in&nbsp; question,&nbsp; should be made, not in the case at bar, but in Case No.&nbsp; 33913, where the writ was issued.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; a writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; certiorari is granted, but the writ of prohibition prayed for is denied, and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by respondent Judge on&nbsp; October 3, 1957,&nbsp; is hereby declared null&nbsp; and void,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; People's Bank&nbsp; and Trust Company.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
