Gorgonio Armobit and Hosario Armobit in the aforesaid sum of P3,998,00, 
Philippine currency.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the crime was committed with the aggravating circumstance of 
dwelling, as the said robbery was committed in the house inhabited by 
the offended party."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> When arraigned Francisco pleaded not guilty, but on the day of the 
trial, assisted by counsel and with the permission of the court, he 
withdrew his plea of not guilty and instead pleaded guilty to the 
information above reproduced. He was sentenced for the crime defined and
 penalized in Article 294, paragraph 5, of the Revised Penal Code in 
connection with. Articles 29? and 296 of the same Code, to an 
indeterminate penalty of not less than two (2) years, four (4) months 
and one (1) day of <em>prision correccional </em>and not more than eight
 (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>, to indemnify the 
offended party in the sum of P3,998.00, without subsidiary imprisonment 
in case of insolvency, and to pay the proportionate costs.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding his plea of guilty Francisco appealed from the 
decision, and no question of fact being involved in the appeal, the same
 was taken directly to this Court. Atty, Leon S. Viola who was appointed
 counsel de <em>officio</em> for him states in his brief that he 
believes and so recommends that the decision appealed from should be 
affirmed. He further tells us that he conferred with the appellant in 
the Bilibid Prison at Muntinglupa, Rizal; and that apparently to 
establish his innocence, appellant assured him that he could not have 
committed the crime of robbery with violence and intimidation attributed
 to him because at the time of its commission he (appellant) was 
confined at the Boy's Correctional School at Welfareville, Mandaluyong, 
Rizal. Acting upon this assurance Atty. Viola went to the Correctional 
Institution to check up on the record of Francisco in that institution 
and he found that appellant was confined in that School from March 13th 
to March 28th, 1946, while the crime of robbery took place on January 
12, 1946, that is to say, about two months before his confinement at 
Velfarevllie. From all this, we are convinced that appellant Francisco 
is really guilty of the crime charged against him, and that seeing no 
other way of saving himself tie thought of this scheme of proving an <em>alibi</em>.
 Fortunately, however, the records of the Boyfe Correctional School at 
Welfare ville are still intact to flatly disprove his false claim. We 
find the maximum penalty imposed by the trial court to be within the 
range provided by law. We believe, however, that the minimum penalty 
could well and should be raised to four (4) years. </p>
<p>With this modification, the decision appealed from is hereby 
affirmed, with costs. </p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, 
Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, </em>and <em>Diokno, JJ.,</em> 
concur.</p>
