				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal originated from&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Palawan,&nbsp; dismissing the&nbsp; above-entitled case on the ground that the cause of action alleged in the complaint had prescribed, and the plaintiff had no longer any cause of&nbsp; action against the defendant.<br><br>The&nbsp; undisputed facts&nbsp; of this case are&nbsp; as follows: In December&nbsp; 1936, Rio y Olabarrieta (now Rio y Compania), entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; a contract&nbsp; with defendant-appellee,&nbsp; Datu Jolkipli, wherein the&nbsp; latter agreed to&nbsp; undertake&nbsp; the exploitation&nbsp; of a&nbsp; timber concession of the former in the municipality of Brooke's&nbsp; Point, Palawan.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; give&nbsp; Jolkipli&nbsp; the&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to carry on&nbsp; the venture,&nbsp; Rio y Olabarrieta extended credit to him.&nbsp; As of January 1939, Jolkipli had incurred an outstanding obligation of P620.82 in favor of plaintiff-appellant Rio y Compania (successor to Rio y Olabarrieta) and as of the filing of the complaint, on April 19, 1954, the accumulated&nbsp; interests from January 1939 amount&nbsp; to P948.11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon motion of&nbsp; Jolkipli,&nbsp; the complaint was dismissed by the Justice of the Peace on the&nbsp; ground of prescription; and plaintiff appealed to&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Palawan.&nbsp; However, the decision of the Justice of the Peace Court was there sustained and, upon&nbsp; the denial of the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant's motion for&nbsp; reconsideration, it interposed&nbsp; the present&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>Plaintiff&nbsp; predicates&nbsp; its case&nbsp; mainly on two points:&nbsp; (1) that the court below improperly denied it an opportunity to prove that&nbsp; the Justice of the Peace Court at Brooke's Point was&nbsp; not open during the Japanese occupation and the&nbsp; period of&nbsp; military&nbsp; operations&nbsp; for the&nbsp; liberation of the Philippines; and (2) that the court below erroneously declared that the moratorium period to be deducted from the&nbsp; term of&nbsp; extinctive&nbsp; prescription&nbsp; extended&nbsp; only from March&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1945&nbsp; (as&nbsp; declared by&nbsp; President&nbsp; Osmena's Executive Order No. 32) to July 26, 1948 when the Moratorium&nbsp; Law, Republic Act No. 342&nbsp; was enacted.<br><br>We rule&nbsp; for plaintiff-appellant on&nbsp; both points.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the&nbsp; first, while it&nbsp; is&nbsp; true&nbsp; that the&nbsp; suspensive effect of Executive Orders Nos. 26 and&nbsp; 32, together&nbsp; with Republic Act&nbsp; 342, do&nbsp; not cover&nbsp; the period of&nbsp; invasion and the liberation of&nbsp; the Philippines,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court has&nbsp; in&nbsp; several cases already held that:<br><blockquote>"The statute of limitations is only suspended by war, rebellion, insurrection <span style="font-style: italic;">when the regular course of justice is interrupted to such&nbsp; an&nbsp; extent&nbsp; that the courts cannot&nbsp; be kept open."</span>&nbsp; (España <i>vs.</i> Lucido, 8 Phil., 419, 420; Palma &amp; Los Baños <i>vs.</i> Celda, 81 Phil., 416, 46 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; Suppl. No. 1, p. 198.)&nbsp; (Italics supplied.) "The&nbsp; interruption in the&nbsp; functions of the courts by the war interrupted the&nbsp; running&nbsp; of the prescriptive period&nbsp; of actions." (Talens,&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> M.&nbsp; Chuakay &amp; Co.,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-10127, June 30, 1958.)<br></blockquote>In the light of these&nbsp; decisions,&nbsp; it is clear that&nbsp; the statute&nbsp; of&nbsp; limitation&nbsp; is&nbsp; suspended,&nbsp; if&nbsp; during the war time&nbsp; courts&nbsp; are not or can&nbsp; not be kept&nbsp; open.&nbsp; But in order that the plaintiff-appellant may&nbsp; invoke&nbsp; our ruling, it must first show that the Justice of the Peace Court of Brooke's&nbsp; Point was closed or could not&nbsp; be&nbsp; opened for business as a&nbsp; consequence of&nbsp; chaos&nbsp; and confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The determination of this matter&nbsp; is a question of&nbsp; fact, which should be ventilated in the hearing of&nbsp; the case on the merits; and the court below should not have&nbsp; refused the plaintiff an opportunity to substantiate its contention.<br><br>As to the second issue tendered by appellant, it must be pointed out that the obligation of the defendant was contracted before&nbsp; December 31, 1941; hence, the moratorium order applicable to it was the&nbsp; second, i.e., Executive Order No. 32, issued on March 10,&nbsp; 1945.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Regardless whether or not the local court was open during the occupation, the period for the enforcement of appellant's cause of action stopped running on that date.&nbsp; If the&nbsp; defendant was not&nbsp; a war sufferer, the suspension ran only&nbsp; from March 10, 1945&nbsp; to July 26, 1948, when&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 342 went into effect.&nbsp; But if the defendant was a war sufferer,&nbsp; and had filed&nbsp; a war damage claim, then the period of suspension extended from March 10, 1945 until&nbsp; May 18, 1953, when our&nbsp; decision&nbsp; in the Rutter case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> holding unconstitutional the further operation of Republic Act 342, became operative.&nbsp; Admittedly,&nbsp; in this last&nbsp; case, the&nbsp; appellant's complaint was filed on time.<br><br>Under the circumstances, it was Incumbent upon&nbsp; the defendant to plead and prove&nbsp; that he was not&nbsp; covered by the Moratorium Law, Act&nbsp; 342, in order to establish that plaintiff's action was barred by&nbsp; prescription in&nbsp; all cases that may be established under the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule, on the authority of Lyon&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Bertram, 20 How. (U.S.) 149, 15 Law.&nbsp; Ed. 847, is stated by American Jurisprudence to be&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"A plea of the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; (of limitations)&nbsp; can not be sustained which rests upon a supposed state of&nbsp; facts&nbsp; which may not exist. It must be an answer to any case which may be legally established under the&nbsp; declaration.&nbsp; So where the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; a&nbsp; bar&nbsp; on certain contracts after&nbsp; three years and&nbsp; on&nbsp; others&nbsp; after two&nbsp; years the plea of the statute was held&nbsp; to be bad where it&nbsp; did not show that&nbsp; the contract in question was of the latter class."&nbsp; (34 Am. Jur. 341,&nbsp; Sec. 431, note 8.) &nbsp;</blockquote>The defendant has&nbsp; not shown nor&nbsp; pleaded that he was not a war sufferer and had not filed a war damage claim. While constituting&nbsp; negative&nbsp; averments, they&nbsp; are of the essence of his contention that plaintiff's claim was barred, and&nbsp; hence the burden of proving&nbsp; them lay on defendant- appellee&nbsp; (Rule&nbsp; 123, sec.&nbsp; 70).&nbsp; Moreover, it appears that in his&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; offered&nbsp; to&nbsp; prove that defendant was&nbsp; such a war damage&nbsp; claimant,&nbsp; but&nbsp; the&nbsp; court below rejected the&nbsp; offer.&nbsp; Plainly,&nbsp; the rejection&nbsp; is reversible error.<br><br>If&nbsp; defendant is&nbsp; a war&nbsp; damage&nbsp; claimant,&nbsp; appellant's action was initiated only 7 years, 1 month and&nbsp; 10 days after the cause of action accrued, well before the expiration of the ten year limitation period; because from the total of 15 years,&nbsp; 3 months and&nbsp; 18 days that elapsed from the accrual of the cause of action on&nbsp; January 1,&nbsp; 1939,&nbsp; to the filing of the&nbsp; complaint on April 15, 1954, we&nbsp; must&nbsp; deduct the moratorium period of 8&nbsp; years, 2 months and 8 days (from March 10, 1945 to May 18,&nbsp; 1953).<br><br>Wherefore, the order of dismissal of the complaint&nbsp; is revoked and&nbsp; set aside, and the records ordered remanded to the&nbsp; court of origin&nbsp; for&nbsp; further proceedings.&nbsp; Costs against appellee Datu Jolkipli.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
