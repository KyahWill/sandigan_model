				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 17, 1953, Josefina Mortel complained before this Court against Attorney Anacleto F.&nbsp; Aspiras, alleging substantially that:<br><ol type="1"><li>Sometime in August, 1952, the respondent, representing&nbsp; himself as single,&nbsp; courted her&nbsp; and eventually&nbsp; won her affection; 2. on December&nbsp; 22, 1952,&nbsp; following his instructions, she came to Manila so they could get married, and she stayed with her sister at No. 10 Espiritu, Pasay City; 3. on and after December 31, 1952, upon being assured&nbsp; of&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; she allowed him to&nbsp; live with&nbsp; her as her&nbsp; husband; 4. on January 3, 1953, a&nbsp; marriage license was.applied for, with the son of&nbsp; the respondent, Cesar Aspiras, as one of the applicants; 5.&nbsp; upon suggestion of respondent, she was married to said Cesar Aspiras, although she was not in love&nbsp; with the&nbsp; latter; 6. after the marriage,&nbsp; she and&nbsp; respondent continued&nbsp; cohabiting together, the ceremony being a mere formality performed at the indication of respondent, who was a&nbsp; married man and who used his knowledge and education to&nbsp; abuse and destroy her.<br></li></ol>On April 9, 1953, the petitioner filed a motion to "withdraw and/or&nbsp; dismiss" alleging&nbsp; that the&nbsp; contents&nbsp; of her complaint did&nbsp; not&nbsp; "represent her true sentiments", the respondent acted in good faith, and her&nbsp; marriage to respondent's son, Cesar Aspiras, was "without any fraud or deceit whatsoever".<br><br>Believing that the matter was not a mere private affair of petitioner, but that it affected the legal&nbsp; profession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, this Court denied the motion to dismiss, and&nbsp; required the respondent to answer.<br><br>On May 6, 1953, the respondent made his answer, asserting that petitioner had really married his son Cesar Aspiras, and denying having had any amorous&nbsp; or sexual relations with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also said she knew all the time he was a married man.<br><br>On May 13, 1953, the Court referred the case to the Solicitor&nbsp; General&nbsp; for investigation, report&nbsp; and&nbsp; recommendation.<br><br>On November&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the Solicitor General reported that in view of the&nbsp; motion to withdraw filed by the petitioner, he found no other alternative but to recommend the dismissal of the&nbsp; case.<br><br>Of course, for&nbsp; lack of evidence, the complaint was dismissed&nbsp; on November 5, 1953.<br><br>However, on December 17, 1953, the petitioner filed a motion&nbsp; to re-open the matter, alleging that she had asked for&nbsp; dismissal before the office of&nbsp; the Solicitor&nbsp; General pursuant to an amicable&nbsp; settlement with the respondent; but that the truth was, petitioner and respondent lived together as husband and wife, from April to November, 1953 at No.&nbsp; 383&nbsp; Int. 5 Tejeron,&nbsp; Sta. Ana, Manila and that as a result she was on the family way.&nbsp; She also&nbsp; charged the respondent with having ordered his son, Cesar, to live with them, for the purpose of "camouflaging their living together".<br><br>On January 5, 1954, this&nbsp; Court granted the above petition to re-open&nbsp; and&nbsp; referred the papers to the Solicitor General for re-investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>After conducting the proper inquiry, and based on the evidence adduced before him,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Solicitor General filed in accordance with the Rules a complaint against the respondent, praying for his disbarment, on the&nbsp; ground that he seduced Josefina Mortel by a promise of marriage, and to cover up his illicit&nbsp; relations, he made his son, Cesar, a minor to marry the said Josefina Mortel on&nbsp; January 14, 1953; and,&nbsp; what is worse, after the marriage, the respondent continued having&nbsp; sexual relations with the&nbsp; spouse of his own son.<br><br>On May. 6, 1955, this Court ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent to reply to the official charges of the Government prosecutor. He replied in due time repeating the same denials he had previously made in this Court.&nbsp; Then&nbsp; he asked&nbsp; for, and was granted, a&nbsp; chance to introduce evidence in addition to the proofs&nbsp; submitted to, and forwarded by, the Solicitor General.&nbsp; Yet he failed to produce any.<br><br>At the oral argument he did not appear to&nbsp; defend himself, but asked&nbsp; for&nbsp; permission to&nbsp; file&nbsp; a memorandum— which he afterwards presented.&nbsp; Therein he maintains that the complaint's allegations were not supported by the evidence, that the petitioner <i>is in pan delicto</i> and deserves no remedy, and that the alleged misconduct is not&nbsp; sufficient ground for disbarment.<br><br>In regard to the first point, the oral and documentary evidence at hand establish&nbsp; beyond reasonable doubt the following facts:<br><br>In the year 1952 Josefina Mortel, 21 years of age, single, was a teacher residing with her widowed mother in Sar wang Barrio School, Romblon, Romblon.&nbsp; Sometime in August, of that year she met the respondent.&nbsp; Atty. Anacleto P. Aspiras, an employee of the Cebu Portland Cement Co., who represented himself as single, although ne was already married to Carolina Bautista Aspiras with whom he had seven children.<br><br>A reckless Lothario, he wooed her personally and by correspondence until he&nbsp; finally conquered hers trusting heart. He visited her at her house and must have charmed even the&nbsp; mother, because&nbsp; without much ado she approved of him. The climax came when on&nbsp; a certain night of November, 1952, he was invited to stay and spend the night at her house, due to a typhoon which was raging.&nbsp; About 3 or 4 a.m., while the mother was in the kitchen, he crept into Josefina's room and after glibly promising marriage, succeeded in seducing her.&nbsp; From that time on, and without the benefit&nbsp; of marriage she gave him the privileges of a husband.&nbsp; Thereafter yielding to his invitation, Josefina came to Manila in December, 1952, for the purpose of marrying him, despite her mother's desire to have the marriage celebrated&nbsp; the following month of April, so as to&nbsp; enable&nbsp; her to continue teaching until the&nbsp; end&nbsp; of the school term.&nbsp; She&nbsp; stayed with&nbsp; her sister at 10 Espiritu Street, Pasay City.<br><br>Accompanied by the respondent, she went on January 3, 1953 to the Manila&nbsp; City Hall,&nbsp; where&nbsp; for the&nbsp; first time, she met his son Cesar, who was&nbsp; introduced (by respondent) as his nephew,&nbsp; and&nbsp; her bridegroom-to-be.&nbsp; She says respondent again told her to follow his "instructions", and left the two&nbsp; of them&nbsp; (with Atty. Espino)&nbsp; at the City Hall.&nbsp; He&nbsp; then departed for&nbsp; Cebu.&nbsp;&nbsp; She filled&nbsp; up the application for&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; (Exhibits 7, 8,&nbsp; Respondent)&nbsp; and wrote the name of Cesar as her husband-to-be.<br><br>In connection with the above "instructions",&nbsp; it is probable that before filing the application&nbsp; Josefina discovered or was told that respondent was a married man.&nbsp; But she was persuaded&nbsp; by respondent to&nbsp; enter into a sham&nbsp; marriage with his&nbsp; "nephew" Cesar,&nbsp; so that she&nbsp; may rightfully claim to be <i>Mrs. Josefina Aspiras</i> and save her face before her&nbsp; relatives and&nbsp; acquaintances who had&nbsp; known her amorous relations with Attorney Aspiras.<br><br>Accordingly on January 14, 1953, Josenna and Cesar were married<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> at&nbsp; the Manila City Hall before&nbsp; Judge Aragon,&nbsp; with the respondent and Rosario R. Veloso (Cesar's aunt) as&nbsp; witnesses.&nbsp; After the ceremony, the&nbsp; two contracting parties&nbsp; separated,&nbsp; never to&nbsp; Jive together as husband and wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the respondent continued up to November, 1953 his adulterous relations with Josenna, as a result of&nbsp; which&nbsp; she gave birth to&nbsp; a&nbsp; baby&nbsp; boy on January&nbsp; 24, 1954.<br><br>Josefina's sworn testimony that herein respondent pretended to be&nbsp; single and promised marriage, is confirmed by his love letters, portions of&nbsp; which say:<br><blockquote>"* * * You are alone in my life till the end of my years in this world * *&nbsp; * I will bring you along with me before&nbsp; the&nbsp; altar of matrimony * * *." (Exhibit A-6, September&nbsp; 22, 1952.)<br><br>"Through thick&nbsp; and thin, for better or for worse, in life or in death, my Josephine you will always be the&nbsp; first, middle&nbsp; and the last in my life.&nbsp; In&nbsp; short, you will be the only woman to me as I used to&nbsp; say to you."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit A, November 2, 1952.)</blockquote>And her testimony that after her marriage to Cesar she continued living, as wife,&nbsp; with herein respondent is borne out by&nbsp; his&nbsp; letters&nbsp; to Josefina's mother dated February 9,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; and&nbsp; March 6,&nbsp; 1953—Exhibits A-19 and A-21.<br><br>Obviously the courtship and&nbsp; seduction by&nbsp; respondent was morally wrong,&nbsp; and this obliquity became worse when he made&nbsp; use&nbsp; of his minor son&nbsp; Cesar&nbsp; to "redeem" his promise of marriage and/or to cover up his illicit relations, as the Solicitor General&nbsp; alleged.&nbsp;&nbsp; He corrupted his own descendant&nbsp; by&nbsp; turning him&nbsp; into&nbsp; an accomplice&nbsp; of his marital&nbsp; infidelities.<br><br>But he says, the marriage was&nbsp; a true marriage,&nbsp; the contracting parties being actually in love with each other. Granted.&nbsp; Then his moral delinquency becomes all the more unpardonable: he cohabited with the wife of his own son <i>after the marriage</i> which he&nbsp; himself arranged&nbsp; and witnessed.<br><br>It is immaterial that Josefina&nbsp; Mortel the complainant was also&nbsp; at fault<i>—in pari delicto</i>, respondent suggests— because this is not a proceeding to grant her relief, but one to purge the profession&nbsp; of&nbsp; unworthy members, to protect the&nbsp; public and&nbsp; the courts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>.&nbsp; So&nbsp; much&nbsp; so that even if she should presently ask for dismissal, the matter may not be dropped, the evidence at hand being sufficient to warrant disciplinary&nbsp; action.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; <i>pari delicto</i> is not always a complete defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Supposing that respondent's conduct is not one of those mentioned in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules for&nbsp; which an attorney&nbsp; may be disbarred,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>still,&nbsp; in this&nbsp; jurisdiction, lawyers&nbsp; may&nbsp; be removed from office on grounds other than those&nbsp; enumerated by the statutes.&nbsp; (In re Pelaez,&nbsp; 44 Phil. 567.)&nbsp; And we recently applied that principle in Balinon<i> <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.</i>&nbsp; De Leon, 50&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 583.<br><br>In&nbsp; the United States where from&nbsp; our system of legal ethics derives, "the continued possession * * * of a good moral character is a requisite&nbsp; condition for the rightful continuance&nbsp; in the practice of the law * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; and&nbsp; its loss requires suspension or disbarment, even though&nbsp; the statutes do not&nbsp; specify that&nbsp; as a ground for&nbsp; disbarment." (5&nbsp; Am. Jur.&nbsp; 417.)<br><br>As stated by Mr. Justice&nbsp; Owen, of the Wisconsin Supreme Court,<br><blockquote>"One of&nbsp; the&nbsp; requisite qualifications for one who holds the office of an attorney at law is that he or she shall be of good moral character, in so far as it relates to the discharge of the duties and responsibilities&nbsp; of an attorney at law.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is a continuing qualification necessary to entitle one&nbsp; to admission&nbsp; to the bar, and the loss of such qualification requires his suspension. The respondent is a member of the bar of this&nbsp; court. The charges preferred against him challenge his moral integrity.&nbsp; Just as it was the duty of this court to refuse him admission in the first instance upon a&nbsp; showing that he lacked the necessary&nbsp; qualifications, so is it its duty now to remove him upon like proof."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Re Stolen, 193 Wis. 602; 55&nbsp; A. L. R. 1361.)</blockquote>Perhaps&nbsp; mere moral&nbsp; transgression&nbsp; not amounting&nbsp; to crime&nbsp; will&nbsp; not disbar,&nbsp; as some cases&nbsp; hold<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; and on this we do not&nbsp; decide.&nbsp; But respondent's&nbsp; moral&nbsp; delinquency having been aggravated&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; mockery of the inviolable social&nbsp; institution of marriage,&nbsp; and by corruption&nbsp; of his minor son or destruction of the latter's honor, the&nbsp; under signed all&nbsp; agree he is&nbsp; unfit to continue exercising the privileges and responsibilities of members of the bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Wherefore it becomes the duty&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Court to&nbsp; strike, as&nbsp; it&nbsp; does&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; strike his&nbsp; name&nbsp; from&nbsp; the Roll&nbsp; of Attorneys.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
