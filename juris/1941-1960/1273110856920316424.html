				<H3>THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY THE DIRECTOR OF LANDS, APPLICANT, VS. JACINTA ALVAREZ, ET AL., CLAIMANTS. LIM HAY BE, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE. DALMACIO ATILANO AND EUTALIA ATILANO, OPPOSITORS AND APPELLANTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga, Hon. 
Teodoro Camacho' presiding, ordering Dalmacio Atilano and Eutalia Atilano to 
surrender to the Register of Deeds of the City of Zamboanga, owner's duplicate 
certificate of title No. 3843.<p></p>
<p>Petitioner Lim Hay Be, administratrix of the estate of the deceased Laureano 
Madrazo, alleges that the intestate was the owner of the land covered by 
certificate of title No. 3843, having acquired it at a sale by public auction; 
that the sale was confirmed by an order of the court dated July 4, 1939; that 
from that time the owner's duplicate certificate has been in the possession of 
Melchor Rojas; that demands have been made upon said Melchor Rojas for the 
surrender to petitioner of the owner's duplicate certificate, but the same has 
not been delivered; that the duplicate certificate is now in the possession of 
Dalmacio Atilano and Eutalia Atilano. The petitioner prays that the owner's 
duplicate certificate of title in the name of Melchor Rojas and Maria Socorro 
Pantaleon be surrendered by Dalmacio Atilano and Eutalia Atilano to the Register 
of Deeds of the City of Zamboanga in order that the latter could cancel the same 
and issue, in lieu thereof, a transfer certificate of title in the name of 
Laureano Madrazo.</p>
<p>Dalmacio Atilano filed an opposition to the petition alleging that the land 
was sold by the original owners to Alipio Atilano for P160.00 on February 17, 
1920 and that the said Alipio Atilano on February 2, 1936 sold and conveyed the 
same property to oppositors Dalmacio Atilano and Eutalia Atilano; that on or 
after July 4, 1939, the owner's duplicate was no longer in the possession of 
Melchor Rojas and his wife, but was in that of the oppositors; that no demand 
was ever made by the petitioner or by Laureano Madrazo for the delivery of the 
said duplicate certificate; that the possession of the land remained in the 
oppositors; and that the order of the court of July 4, 1939 can no longer be 
enforced by motion.</p>
<p>Upon the above issues, the parties went to trial and thereafter the court 
issued the order subject of this appeal.</p>
<p>The evidence submitted at the hearing discloses that the original certificate 
of title No. 3843 was issued on October 31, 1913, in the name of Melchor Rojas 
and Maria Socorro Pantaleon. On February 17, 1920, the registered owners sold 
the land to Alipio Atilano for P160.00 (Exhibit ''14"). On February 2, 1936, 
Alipio Atilano in turn sold the property to Dalmacio Atilano and Eutalia Atilano 
for P1.00 (Exhibit "13"). None of the above deeds of sale is registered but 
Dalmacio Atilano and Eutalia Atilano obtained possession of the owner's 
duplicate certificate as well as the possession of the land. On March 9, .1935, 
the property was attached in civil case No. 3252 of the justice of the peace 
court of Zamboanga, entitled Tan Tan vs. Melchor Rojas, this attachment being 
noted at the back of the original certificate of title (Exhibit "10"). It 
further appears that on July 4, 1939, upon petition of the intestate the Court 
of First Instance of Zamboanga ordered the cancellation of certificate of title 
No. 3843 and the issuance of a transfer certificate in the name of the intestate 
(Annex "A").</p>
<p>The real issue presented relates to the respective rights of the petitioner's 
intestate and the oppositors to the land in question, because while the 
petitioner asks for the surrender of flie owner's duplicate to enable the 
Register of Deeds to cancel the original and issue a transfer certificate of 
title in the name of the intestate, the oppositors object thereto claiming 
ownership of the land covered by the certificate by virtue of a previous sale, 
possession of the duplicate certificate and that of the land. So the parties at 
the trial submitted the documents, evidencing their respective titles or claims 
to the property in question. The court below should have refused to take 
cognizance of the petition for lack of jurisdiction. However, it did not do so 
although in its order limited itself to requiring the surrender of the 
certificate for the purpose of annotating the intestate's interest, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court after considering the motion of the 
petitioner dated May 26, 1952 and finding1 that the same is in order, hereby 
GRANTS the same. Dalmacio Atilano and Eutalia Atilano are hereby ordered to 
surrender to the Register of Deeds of the City of Zamboanga, Philippines, the 
owner's duplicate of Original Certificate of Title No. 3843 which is actually 
found in their possession." (p. 25, Record on Appeal.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The lack of jurisdiction of the cadastral court over the subject matter of 
the motion and the issues raised in the opposition was opportunely raised before 
the trial court in oppositor's motion for reconsideration (Record on Appeal, pp. 
44-48) and is again raised before us in Appellant's Brief (Record on Appeal, pp. 
35-36.)</p>
<p>Finding that the court below as a cadastral court has no jurisdiction to pass 
upon the petition and the issues raised and tried before it (Miraflor vs. Leano, 
et al. 93 Phil., 466, 49 Off. Gaz., [7], 2775; Cabangcala, et al. vs. Domingo, 
96 Phil., 124; 50 Off. Gaz., [11], 5319; Enriquez, et al., vs Atienza, et al., 
100 Phil, 1072, 53 Off. Gaz., [20], 7231; Castillo vs. Ramos, et al., 78 Phil., 
809, 45 Off. Gaz., 183), the order issued is hereby reversed, and the petition 
is hereby dismissed, with costs against the petitioner and appellee.</p>
