				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><strong></strong>In a foreclosure proceeding instituted 
before the war by the Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros <em>vs</em>. Angela 
Aguilar de Guzman and Fortunato A. Guzman, Case No. 57776 of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, the herein respondent Sixto A. Carlos was the purchaser at 
public auction of the mortgaged property. The sale was confirmed by the Court of 
First Instance of Manila on December 4, 1941, subject only to the right of 
redemption of the herein petitioner, Fidelity and Surety Company of the 
Philippines, as holder of a second mortgage on said property. This reservation 
was made because the petitioner, as second mortgagee, had not bean included in 
the foreclosure proceeding filed by the Monte de Piedad y Caja de Ahorros, as 
first mortgagee. The herein petitioner instituted a separate foreclosure 
proceeding against the Guzman spouses (Civil Case No. 59593 of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila), in which judgment of foreclosure was rendered on 
August 18, 1941. This judgment was appealed by the Guzman spouses to the Court 
of Appeals wherein the case was pending until August, 1943, when the Guzman 
spouses paid their obligation to the petitioner in Japanese military notes and 
the parties moved for the dismissal of the appeal in view of an amicable 
settlement. On August 11, 1945, the herein respondent filed a petition in the 
Court of First Instance of Manila in G. L. R. O. Cad. Record No. 392, praying 
that the Register of Deeds of Manila be ordered to cancel in the certificate of 
title the annotation covering the right of redemption in favor of petitioner. 
After hearing, the Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order granting 
the petition. Upon appeal by the petitioner, the Court of Appeals affirmed the 
order of the Court of First instance of Manila. The petitioner has come to us by 
way of <i>certiorari</i>, seeking the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals. 

<p>The Court of First Instance of Manila predicated its the has der its order 
granting the petition of herein respondent on ground that the right of 
redemption of the petitioner expired. The Court of Appeals, in affirming the or 
of the Court of First Instance of Manila, premised conclusion on the ruling that 
the payment made by Angela Aguilar de Guzman and Fortunato R. Guzman to the 
petitioner in Japanese military notes was valid and therefore wiped out the 
second mortgage in favor of the petitioner.<br><br>The main contention of the 
herein petitioner is that the Court of First instance of Manila, as a court of 
land registration, and the Court of Appeals on appeal, had no jurisdiction of 
the case if their decision necessarily involves the validity or invalidity of 
the payment in question.<br><br>In G.R. No. L-2020, La Orden de Padres 
Benedictinos de Filipinas <em>vs</em>. The Philippine Trust Company,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> decided on December 29, 1949, we made the 
following pronouncement: "In support of first assignment of error, appellant 
cites the case of Castillo <em>vs</em>. Ramos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> G. R. No. L-1031, decided by this Court in 
July, 1947, wherein it was held that the validity of payment with Japanese 
military notes during the war of a pre-war obligation in genuine Philippine 
currency, is such a transcendental question that it is beyond the special and 
limited jurisdiction of a Court of First Instance acting as a court of Land 
Registration. However, in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Haw 
Pia <em>vs</em>. China Banking Corporation, G. R. No. L-554 in which it was 
ruled that payments made with Japanese war notes during the occupation of 
obligations contracted before the war, to the creditors or his legal 
representatives, and accepted by them, are valid and release the said 
obligations, there no longer is any doubt as to the validity of similar 
payments. As was said in the case of Castillo <em>vs</em>. Ramos, supra, if 
there is no substantial controversy between the parties about the cancellation 
of any encumbrance noted in any certificate title as there can be no serious 
controversy between petitioner and oppositor in the present case because the 
payment of the loan and the execution of the corresponding deed of cancellation 
of the second mortgage not denied, then the lower court had jurisdiction to 
order the inscription of the deed of cancellation and the cancellation of the 
annotations on the back of the certificates of title."<br><br>As payment by the 
Guzman spouses in Japanese military notes to the petitioner is admitted herein, 
the ruling above quoted is perfectly applicable. This result makes it 
unnecessary for us to pass upon petitioner's contention that its right of 
redemption has not yet expired.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed decision of the 
Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioner. </p>So 
ordered.<br><br><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, JJ</em>., concur. <br><i>Padilla, J.</i>, see concurring opinion.<br><i>Tuason, J.</i>, joins Justice Padilla in his opinion.<br><i>Feria </i>and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, took no part.<br><br><br>

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING OPINION<br></strong></p><p>PADILLA, <i>J</i>.: <br><br>I concur in the result. 
There seems to be no need o£ invoking the rule laid down in the case of "La 
Orden d«i Padres Benedictinos de Filipinas <em>vs</em>. The Philippine Trust 
Co.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>"G. R. No. L-2020, 29 December 
1949, because, cording to the majority opinion, the debtors paid to the 
petitioner the debt the payment of which was secured by a second mortgage on the 
property "and the parties moved for the dismissal of the appeal (then pending in 
the Court of Appeals) in view of an amicable settlement," and because the right 
of redemption had already expired, as found by the trial court. But if the 
ground for affirming the order of cancellation of the right of redemption in 
favor of the petitioner appealed from is the rule laid down in the case referred 
to, then I dissent from such ground for the same reasons stated in my opinion in 
said case.</p></div>
