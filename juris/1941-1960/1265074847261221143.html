				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 22, 1953,&nbsp; Mariano Acosta, et al.,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Agrarian Relations praying for&nbsp; a&nbsp; readjustment&nbsp; of the sharing ratio governing their tenancy relationship with Hacienda de Santos No. 5 situated in several municipalities of the province of Nueva Ecija and for&nbsp; other&nbsp; sundry readjustment&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with said relationship.&nbsp; The petition makes as party respondents the hacienda&nbsp; itself and one Alberto de&nbsp; Santos as manager of the hacienda.&nbsp;&nbsp; This petition was subsequently amended by&nbsp; introducing therein&nbsp; certain&nbsp; changes which do&nbsp; not&nbsp; materially alter&nbsp; the&nbsp; substance&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the original petition.<br><br>On April&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1954, respondents&nbsp; answered the amended petition setting up as special defense the fact that the court has no jurisdiction to order the&nbsp; reliquidation of tenancy matters of previous years because such matters are governed&nbsp; by the tenancy contracts that had&nbsp; been entered into between&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; management of the hacienda.<br><br>The case was not tried on the merits but was submitted to&nbsp; arbitration&nbsp; upon direction&nbsp; of the President&nbsp; of the Philippines because of the&nbsp; importance of the issues&nbsp; involved, having&nbsp; been designated&nbsp; as&nbsp; arbiter Hon. Arsenio C.&nbsp; Roldan, presiding judge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; On August 5,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; Judge Roldan rendered his award&nbsp; wherein he ordered that a reliquidation be&nbsp; made in&nbsp; accordance with certain conditions&nbsp; and findings he made therein designating for that purpose Atty. Francisco Abella and Examiner Crispulo Tria,&nbsp; both employees of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; basis of the reliquidation made, the Court of Agrarian Relations, on January 10, 1958, issued an order awarding in favor of the tenants whose&nbsp; names&nbsp; appear listed&nbsp; therein, certain amounts of palay that were found to&nbsp; be payable to them, and ordering respondents to make&nbsp; delivery&nbsp; of the&nbsp; palay in accordance with the&nbsp; award.&nbsp; This order not having been complied with, the agrarian&nbsp; court directed that a writ of execution&nbsp; be issued&nbsp; and,&nbsp; on March 12,&nbsp; 1958, the clerk of court&nbsp; acted&nbsp; accordingly&nbsp; by requiring the provincial&nbsp; sheriff to collect from respondents the amounts of&nbsp; palay adjudicated to&nbsp; the tenants, or&nbsp; their equivalent in cash at&nbsp; the rate of P10.20&nbsp; per&nbsp; cavan,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; stating in the&nbsp; writ that&nbsp; the sheriff should "levy upon the properties&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-named&nbsp; respondents, both&nbsp; movable and real and&nbsp; cause to be collected&nbsp; therefrom&nbsp; the total amount due to the petitioners under the aforementioned order dated January 10, 1958."&nbsp; In other words, the sheriff was ordered to levy upon the personal properties not only of the owner of the hacienda but also of Alberto de Santos who was made a co-respondent in the petition.&nbsp; On March 20, 1958, Alberto de Santos filed a motion with the agrarian court praying that the writ&nbsp; of execution issued to enforce the award be quashed&nbsp; insofar as it requires that a levy be made upon&nbsp; his own&nbsp; personal properties considering&nbsp; that he is not&nbsp; involved in the case in his personal capacity, but only as manager of the hacienda.&nbsp; This motion was denied.&nbsp; Hence the present petition&nbsp; for review.<br><br>Petitioner claims that the agrarian court acted in excess of its jurisdiction&nbsp; in ordering in the writ&nbsp; of execution issued to enforce the award made in favor of the tenants that a levy be made not only upon the personal properties of the owner of the hacienda but also upon his own personal properties considering that he is not&nbsp; involved in the case in his personal capacity but only as manager of the hacienda.<br><br>There is merit in this claim.&nbsp; It is clear not only from the original petition filed&nbsp; in this case but also in the amended one that the&nbsp; real party respondent is Hacienda de&nbsp; Santos No. 5 whose owner is Felipe de Santos although Alberto de Santos was included as co-respondent he being then the manager&nbsp; of the hacienda.&nbsp; And this has to be so&nbsp; because the issues involved in&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; refer&nbsp; to&nbsp; a reliquidation of the harvests that had been gathered from said hacienda during several years in the past upon the theory that the sharing ratio that had been observed in the original liquidation was not in accordance with&nbsp; law. It is therefore clear that the only party in interest affected by the petition is the owner of the hacienda.&nbsp; Moreover, there&nbsp; is nothing in the award from&nbsp; which&nbsp; it may be inferred that Alberto de Santos has been made personally liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; any amount of palay&nbsp; which may&nbsp; have&nbsp; been withheld from the&nbsp; tenants, his only intervention in the case being merely&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; his capacity&nbsp; as&nbsp; manager of the hacienda. It is&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; and improper to make him personally liable for the satisfaction of the award or to&nbsp; order the&nbsp; levy upon&nbsp; his personal property to make the execution&nbsp; effective.&nbsp; In this respect,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; agrarian court&nbsp; has clearly acted in excess of its jurisdiction.<br><br>This Court&nbsp; does&nbsp; not find any plausible reason for&nbsp; the action taken&nbsp; by the agrarian court considering that&nbsp; the owner of&nbsp; the hacienda&nbsp; is&nbsp; known&nbsp; and&nbsp; enough&nbsp; properties that may&nbsp; be levied upon&nbsp; belonging to the hacienda can be&nbsp; ascertained and determined with little diligence and discernment without implicating properties of&nbsp; a person who is foreign&nbsp; to&nbsp; the case.&nbsp; Evidently, there is an intent to cause unnecessary harassment to herein&nbsp; petitioner. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; orders&nbsp; appealed from are&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; set aside.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is ordered&nbsp; that the writ&nbsp; of execution issued by the agrarian&nbsp; court&nbsp; be modified&nbsp; by excluding therefrom the properties belonging&nbsp; to Alberto de Santos and&nbsp; by limiting.its scope to&nbsp; those owned by&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner of the hacienda in question.&nbsp; No&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Endencia,&nbsp; Barrera,</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
