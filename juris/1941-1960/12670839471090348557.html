				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petition for review filed by the oppositor-petitioner Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc., against the decision of the Public Service Commission in its Case No. 96322, ordering&nbsp; the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience to the respondent&nbsp; Times Transportation&nbsp; Co., Inc. to operate a TPU&nbsp; (auto-trucks)&nbsp; service on the&nbsp; following lines:<br><br><blockquote>Vigan, Ilocos Sur—Bolinao,&nbsp; Pangasinan&nbsp; (3 units) <br>Vigan, Ilocos Sur—Dagupan City (2 units) <br>Vigan, Ilocos Sur—Baguio City&nbsp; (1 unit).</blockquote><br><br>Petitioner assails the decision on two&nbsp; grounds, namely:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) that&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; presented is not sufficient to reasonably support a grant of the certificate; and&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; that such questioned action of the Commission would only lead&nbsp; to ruinous competition among authorized operators.<br><br>The evidence of record&nbsp; establishes fully the need for more transportation services on the lines sought to be established by the respondent Times Transportation Co., Inc., a domestic corporation wholly owned by citizens&nbsp; of the Philippines.&nbsp; It is disclosed that, due to the fast expansion of commerce and&nbsp; industry in and around the area applied for, there&nbsp; has been&nbsp; increasing demand from the riding public for more and better transportation facilities.&nbsp; Existing&nbsp; operators admit there is no direct and continuous service from Vigan to Dagupan&nbsp; City or from&nbsp; Vigan to Bolinao, and with respect to the Vigan-Baguio City route, that only the Manila&nbsp; Railroad&nbsp; Company renders such service.&nbsp; While the mere&nbsp; absence of a direct&nbsp; or nontransfer service would not necessarily warrant an authorization for more or additional services, such absence, when coupled with an aggravating volume of traffic conditions along the lines proposed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be served, may justify the authorization.&nbsp; In the routes, applied for, witnesses declared that the means of transportation now available are inadequate to cope with the movement of passengers and the&nbsp; latter usually encounter&nbsp; many difficulties, inconveniences and delays before they are able to secure proper accommodations.<br><br>Petitioner would want us to examine and weigh the evidence anew&nbsp; and arrive at conclusions&nbsp; different from the Commission's.&nbsp; This we may&nbsp; not do, except in those instances where "it clearly appears that&nbsp; there was no competent evidence before it to support reasonably its decision" (Espiritu <i>vs.</i> Los Bafios, G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-7121, July 30, 1955, cited and quoted in&nbsp; Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. et al. <i>vs.</i> Hipolito, G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-9278, April 21,&nbsp; 1957), which is not true in this&nbsp; case.<br><br>Petitioner cites 1953&nbsp; and 1956&nbsp; decisions of the Public Service Commission&nbsp; denying previous applications along the same proposed lines (not for direct service), but those were based on circumstances peculiarly their own.&nbsp; Considering that the old&nbsp; applications were filed years before and that it appears that the traffic conditions have actually changed, we cannot&nbsp; attach&nbsp; much&nbsp; significance to&nbsp; these denials.<br><br>That the grant of the certificate in question would only lead to ruinous competition appears ip be mere speculation, not supported by the evidence of record.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision under review is hereby affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia, Barrera,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Gutierrez&nbsp; David,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
