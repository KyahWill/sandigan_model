				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Juanito Solon, a rig driver in the City of Cebu, was prosecuted and 
convicted, first in the Municipal Court and on appeal, in the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu, and sentenced to pay a fine of one Peso (P1.00), with 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, for violation of a city 
ordinance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> requiring drivers of 
animal-drawn vehicles to pick up, gather and deposit in receptacles the manure 
emitted or discharged by their vehicle-drawing animals in any public highways, 
streets, plazas, parks or alleys of the City.</p>
<p>In this appeal, as well as in the lower courts, the accused-appellant assails 
the legality of the ordinance under which he was convicted, as violative of the 
equal protection clause of the Constitution, the same being discriminatory, 
partial and oppressive in the sense that it does not equally apply to all owners 
and possessors of animals, but its application is limited to owners and drivers 
of vehicle-drawing animals.</p>
<p>The principle is well-recognized that the limited application of a statute, 
either in the objects to which it is directed or by the territory within which 
it is to operate, does not necessarily violate the guaranty of "equal protection 
of the laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It is sufficient, for 
purposes of complying with this constitutional mandate, that the classification 
be reasonable, not arbitrary or capricious. And, for the classification to be 
considered reasonable, the same must be based on substantial distinction which 
make real differences; must be germane to the purposes of the law; must not be 
limited to existing conditions only, and must apply equally to each member of 
the class, under similar conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>In the case at bar, there is no doubt that the ordinance in question, seeking 
to eliminate animal wastes in the city streets and other public places, is a 
measure designed to promote the health and well-being of the residents. It is so 
stated in the ordinance. Admittedly, the same is directed only against 
vehicle-drawing animals passing through said places and thoroughfares. But it 
cannot be said that the classification is without reasonable basis.</p>
<p>The danger to the health of the inhabitants, posed by the animal discharges 
littering the city streets and other public places, cannot be minimized. 
Confronted with this unhealthy and unsightly situation, the Municipal Board of 
the City of Cebu-passed the questioned legislation. As stated in the resolution 
of the Board, this condition was principally brought about by the presence of 
about 5,000 horses drawing rigs for hire, that ply the city streets day and 
night which, in the course of their occupation, naturally make the objectional 
discharges. Their stay in these public places must be more or less regular that 
the Board estimated the wastes discharged by these animals and deposited therein 
to be around 5,000 kilos a day. Appellant's objection, however, is against the 
application of the prohibition only to these vehicle-drawing animals and in not 
extending its operation to those animals that, although not so utilized, 
similarly pass through the same streets. It is possible that there may he 
non-vehiele-drawing animals that also traverse these roads, but their number 
must be negligible and their appearance therein merely occasional, compared to 
the rig- drawing ones, as not to constitute a menace to the health of the 
community. There is, likewise, no proof that in its application, the ordinance 
grants favors or imposes restrictions on certain owners of vehicle-drawing 
animals which are not accorded or enforced on others. In the light of the above 
considerations, we are convinced that the questioned ordinance does not violate 
the constitutional prohibition against class legislation.</p>
<p>Appellant, likewise, contests the validity of the provision of Section 4 of 
the ordinance insofar as it imposes, as penalty, the suspension of the rig 
owner's license, it being- alleged that the violation having been committed by 
the driver, the inclusion of the rig owner in the penalty constitutes 
deprivation of his property without due process of law. The allegation is 
untenable.</p>
<p>In the first place, there is no basis for raising this question in the 
instant case. It was never shown that appellant was not fie owner of the rig he 
was driving at the time the violation was committed. On the other hand, if he is 
not the owner, then there is no point in his raising the issue, because he is 
not affected. The question, therefore, of whether the penalty of suspension may 
be imposed upon the driver without including the owner of the rig as party 
defendant, if the driver is not the owner of the rig, is of no moment in this 
case. In the second place, the decision appealed from, rendered by the Court of 
First Instance, does not impose the suspension of the driver's and the 
rig-owner's licenses, although the Municipal Court included the same. This issue 
is, therefore, academic.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
the appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Gutierrez David, Paredes</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>
