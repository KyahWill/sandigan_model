				<H3>SOLEDAD OSORIO DE FERNANDEZ AND VICENTE T. FERNANDEZ, PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. HON. J. HOWARD MCGRATH AS SUCCESSOR OF THE U.S. PHILIPPINE ALIEN PROPERTY ADMINISTRATOR, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT; REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, INTERVENOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs Soledad Osorio de Fernandez and Vicente Fernandez filed this 
action in the Court of First Instance of Rizal (Civil Case No. 4), for the 
annulment of a deed of sale of a parcel of land located in Navotas, Rizal, 
together with the improvements thereon, executed by plaintiff Soledad Osorio de 
Fernandez in favor of the Osaka Boeki Kaisha, Inc., Japanese corporation, on 
December 29, 1942, on the ground of duress and intimidation.
<p>After her claim to the property had been filed with and disallowed by the 
Alien Property Custodian, as required by the Trading with the Enemy Act, the 
case was heard in the Court of First Instance, where the Republic of the 
Philippines was allowed to intervene. After due trial the Court rendered 
judgment setting aside the conveyance as prayed for, and the defendant Alien 
Property Administrator and the intervenor, Republic of the Philippines, duly 
appealed to this Court. Subsequently, the Attorney General of the United States 
was substituted for the Alien Property Administrator, as successor to the latter 
in his authority and powers.</p>
<p>It is unquestioned that the plaintiff-appellee Soledad Osorio de Fernandez 
was the registered owner of the parcels of land known as lots 1, 2 and 3, plan 
P-su-12189, in Navotas, Rizal, covered by Original Certificate of title No. 2541 
of Rizal. Lot No. 2 was contiguous to the Varadero de Yangco in Navotas, which 
the Japanese Navy took over and used, during the occupation, for repairing and 
reconditioning their vessels. On December 29, 1942, said appellee executed two 
documents concerning said lands: one (Exhibit A) conveying lot No. 2, 
P-su-12189, and its improvements, in favor of the Osaka Boeki Kaisha, Inc., a 
Japanese corporation, for a stated price of P70,555; and the other was an 
affidavit (Exhibit 2) requesting cancellation of an annotated lease with option 
to buy covering lot No. 1, P-su-12189, in favor of Da. Filomena De la Rua Vda. 
de Villaescusa, on the ground that both lease and option had already expired. 
Both documents appear acknowledged by plaintiff on the same day before notary 
public, Leandro Sevilla, and bear consecutive numbers (40 and 41) in his 
Notarial Register for 1942; and according to the official records, both 
documents appear presented on the same day, January 5, 1943, by plaintiffs son, 
Jose 0. Fernandez, to the Register of Deeds of Rizal. It also appears of record 
that in view thereof, Original Certificate of Title No. 2541 was cancelled and 
in its stead, the Register of Deeds issued three Transfer Certificates: No. 
44631 (covering Lot 2) in the name of Osaka Boeki Kaisha, Inc. and Nos. 44632 
(for Lot 1) and 44633 (for Lot 3) in the name of plaintiff Soledad Osorio de 
Fernandez, whose son Jose signed the receipt for all three certificates.</p>
<p>Plaintiff-appellee's husband, Vicente Fernandez and her son Jose 0. 
Fernandez, testified in Court that one Mori, manager of the Osaka Boeki Kaisha, 
Inc. had called at their house, and expressed desire to purchase the afore- 
mentioned Lot No. 2, Psu-12189, because the Japanese navy needed it, but was 
told it was not for sale; that said Mori returned one week later, on December 
29, 1942, accompanied by a Japanese officer, and reiterated the offer to buy, 
and by threats that the Navy could appropriate the land and that refusal to 
cooperate would mean punishment or death, succeeded in coercing plaintiff into 
signing the deed of sale and making her husband sign as a witness. It is claimed 
that on this occasion the notary public was not present, nor was any 
acknowledgment clause written below the signatures; and that the Japanese only 
delivered P3,000 by way of advance payment, which plaintiff accepted lest their 
refusal be interpreted as lack of confidence in the military notes.</p>
<p>The witnesses for the plaintiffs further testified that about a week later, 
on January 5, 1943, Mori ordered the plaintiff's son, Jose, to go with him to 
Pasig to register the deed of sale; that the Register asked for the owner's 
duplicate of the Certificate of Title but Mori ordered him to make the record 
and the Register complied; that Mori got all the documents, placed them in his 
portfolio, and ordered Jose O. Fernandez to sign the receipt. Thereafter , both 
returned to Manila and about January 22 Mori paid the balance of the price with 
a check for P67,555, that the plaintiffs deposited in the Bank and from which 
they made withdrawals of P500 a month during the rest of the occupation 
period.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the Court below erred in giving preponderant 
weight to this elaborate story. In the first place, the notary public Leandro 
Sevilla, (who ratified the document) squarely contradicted it, and testified 
that both the deed of sale of Lot No. 2 in favor of Osaka Boeki Kaisha, Inc., 
(Exhibit A) and the affidavit for the cancel- lation of the lease and option to 
buy Lot No. 1 of Psu-12189, (Exhibit 2) were prepared by him at the instance of 
the son of plaintiff, Jose O. Fernandez, who furnished the notary all the 
requisite data; that both documents were signed by plaintiff while sitting in a 
"dokar" (dog-cart) parked on the Escolta, and without Mori or her husband being 
present; that after execution and signature, the deed of sale was brought to the 
Osaka Boeki Kaisha offices in Echague Street where Mori signed on behalf of the 
vendee Company, while plaintiff's husband, Vicente Fernandez, and a Japanese 
called Fuji signed as witnesses, and the downpayment of P3,000 was made. The 
notary further affirmed that he started drafting a petition under Act 496, 
section 44, to segregate the lot sold, but desisted upon advice of Antonio 
Noblejas, clerk of the Judicial Land Title Division of the General Land 
Registration Office (and now Commissioner heading the same) that the petition 
was unnecessary; instead, the notary, accompanied by Jose O. Fernandez and Mr. 
Noblejas, went to the office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal and secured the 
registration of the Osaka deed and the affidavit Lot No. 1 of Certificate of 
Title No. 2541 as well as the issuance of Three Transfer Certificates in lieu of 
the original, delivered to and receipted for by Jose O. Fernandez, the son of 
plaintiff-appellee.</p>
<p>The trial Court has overlooked that the testimony of the Notary Public, whose 
neutrality has not been success- fully assailed, was strikingly supported by the 
execution of the affidavit of cancellation of the option and lease of Lot No. 1, 
(Exhibit 2) which had nothing to do with the alleged forced sale of Lot No. 2 to 
Osaka Boeki Kaisha, Inc. and yet was executed, ratified and recorded 
coetaneously with the questioned sale. Only Soledad Osorio Fernandez could have 
an interest in this affidavit, and its simultaneous execution conclusively 
rebuts her claim that she executed the sale (Exhibit A) under duress. A party 
that is able to carry out an act redounding to its exclusive benefit 
simultaneously with the assailed contract, can net successfully claim in the 
latter case to have acted mechan- ically under the influence of violence or 
intimidation destroying its free agency (Reyes <em>vs</em>. Zaballero, 89 Phil., 
39; Martinez <em>vs</em>. Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank, 15 Phil,, 252; Vales 
<em>vs</em>. Villa, 35 Phil., 769).</p>
<p>Moreover, the testimony for the plaintiff that, when she signed the deed, the 
acknowledgment clause was mis- sing from it, finds no support from the 
appearance of the deed itself, since it is improbable that the acknowledgment 
clause could have been inserted without some horizontal or vertical displacement 
becoming apparent, and Exhibits A and I show none. Also, the receipt Exhibit G, 
issued by Mori for the Transfer Certificate covering Lot. No. 2, Psu-12189, 
belies the testimony of Jose O. Fernandez that in Pasig Mori took with him all 
the transfer certificates issued by the Register of Deeds. Said receipt 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Received from the Register of Deeds for the Province of Eizal (through Dona 
Soledad Osorio de Fernandez) one Owner's Dup- plicate Certificate of Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 44631 (forty-four thousand six hundred thirty-one) in 
the name of the <em>Osaka Boeki Kaisha Inc.</em>, and issued by the Office of 
the Register of Deeds for the Province of Rizal.</p>
<p align="right"><em>Manila, January 22, 1955</em></p>
<p align="right">Osaka Boeki Kaisha Inc.</p>
<p align="right">By:</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) <em>M. Mori</em><br>(Exhibit G)</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if we concede that the sale was executed through threat and intimidation 
by Mori, the action for annulment was waived and the contract ratified by the 
plaintiff's action in depositing the check for the purchase price and 
withdrawing part of the money up to a total of Pll,500 from time to time (Uy Soo 
Lim <em>vs</em>. Tan Unchuan, 38 Phil., 552), specially since according to 
plaintiff's husband they had ample income of their own throughout the 
occupation. The excuse offered, to wit, the fear that if the plaintiff or her 
family did not make the withdrawals, the Japanese might think they did not like 
the Japanese military scrip, might be acceptable to justify one or two 
withdrawals, but does not explain why withdrawals were continued all the way 
from January, 1943, to November, 1944.</p>
<p>As a final argument in annuling the deed of ,sale in question, the lower 
Court held that the transaction being between the military occupant and an 
inhabitant of the occupied territory, over a property that was a war necessity, 
duress may be presumed and no evidence of a particular coercive act is 
necessary. In numerous cases decided before this, particularly Philippine Trust 
Co. <em>vs</em>. Luis Araneta, 83 Phil., 132, 46 Off. Gaz., 4254; People vs. 
Bagalawis, 78 Phil., 174, 44 Off. Gaz., 2655; and People <em>vs</em>. Quilloy, 
88 Phil., 53, this Court has already rejected the theory of "collective" or 
"general" duress allegedly exercised by the Japanese military occupant over the 
inhabitants of this country as a ground to invalidate acts that would otherwise 
be valid and voluntary if done in times of peace.</p>
<p>The decision of the Court below having overlooked significant proof 
supporting the case of appellants, its reversal is warranted. Our conclusion is 
that plaintiffs-appellees Fernandez have failed to rebut the validity and 
regularity of the deed of sale Exhibit A.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the complaint is 
dismissed, with costs against appellees.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador </em>and <em>Concepcion JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
