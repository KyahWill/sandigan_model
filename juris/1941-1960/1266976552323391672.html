prosecutor</i>"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On February 8, 1946, the day set for the hearing appellant 
withdrew his plea of not guilty to substitute it with a plea of guilty to all 
the counts in the amended information, except to four of them, and on the 
condition that a certain phrase from one of the remaining,counts be eliminated. 
The prosecution amended the information by eliminating the phrase objected to in 
.count 19 and discarded counts 13, 17, 18 and 20, to which appellant would not 
plead guilty. Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded guilty to the remaining counts 
in the amended information, except count 9 to which he entered a plea, of not 
guilty, and trial of the case on said count was set for hearing on February 11, 
1946, when the prosecution for want of evidence submitted the case without 
proving said count 9.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in proceeding to 
a consideration of the case when it was clear that, under the circumstances 
obtaining at the time of his arraignment, appellant could not be granted a fair 
hearing, and the trial court erred in sentencing appellant to death, on his plea 
of guilty, without further investigation as to the propriety or impropriety of 
the imposition of said penalty.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant narrated the circumstances under which he pleaded 
guilty in his affidavit attached to a motion for new trial, where he states the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"I, Mariano T. Jaucian, of legal age, Filipino citizen, 
presently interned at the provincial jail, Cebu City, Cebu, after being duly 
sworn, depose and say:</p>
<p align="justify">"That on the 28th of January 1946, one of the guards in the 
provincial jail, City of Cebu, Cebu, called for me inside the jail and told me 
to sign a summons from the People's Court requiring my appearance before the 
aforementioned Court, for trial an the 4th of February 1946 for the crime of 
treason, in Criminal Case No. 204. On the morning of February 4th 1946, fifteen 
other political detainees and myself were then brought to the Court. On that 
very morning all of us were arraigned and all of us pleaded 'not guilty' to the 
charge. On the very same day, after my arraignment and plea of 'not guilty' the 
Court set the following cases for hearing:</p>
<p align="justify">"February 5th—Antonio Racaza Racaza's case<br>"February 
6th—Marcelo Laborte's case<br>"February 7th—the cases against me and Manuel 
Hernandez<br>"February 8th—Cocopate Adlawan's case</p>
<p align="justify">"On the morning of February 5, 1946, Antonio Racaza Racaza was 
brought to the Court for trial and when he was returned to the jail that same 
day, his face was all swollen and was almost unrecognizable in view of the 
injuries he had received from the mob at the provincial capitol, City of Cebu, 
where the People's Court is situated. I asked how it was possible for him to 
have been mobbed when he was guarded, and he answered that his guards, far from 
being concerned about his safety, were the ones who instigated the mob.</p>
<p align="justify">"Racaza's trial was not finished on February 5th. On February 
6th, he was taken back to the Court with Marcelo Laborte, Francisco Concepcion, 
Dionisio Agoncillo and Mateo Perez, all political detainees. When they were 
brought back to jail that day, there were all bleeding from injuries they had 
suffered from the mob. In the afternoon the whole court personnel arrived in the 
provincial jail and held court session there. Antonio Racaza Racaza's trial was 
continued in spite of the fact that he was still groggy because of the physical 
injuries inflicted on him by the mob. When he could no longer endure the pain 
caused by his injuries from the mob on two consecutive days, he called the 
attention of the judges to his physical condition and informed them to stop the 
trial because he would change his plea from 'not guilty' to 'guilty.'</p>
<p align="justify">"On February 7th, Manuel Hernandez and I were brought to the 
court, escorted by ten Filipino military police under one officer. While we were 
on our way to court, our hands were not tied. Then we arrived in Court it was 
overcrowded with people. I saw in the courtroom three American officers. A few 
minutes after our arrival the judges entered the courtroom, and the clerk of 
court ordered silence, as it was very noisy. For a while the crowd kept silent. 
Then the court begun the session. The clerk of court approached me and read the 
information to me and then asked me what my plea was, and I answered him 'not 
guilty'. After this he went to Manuel Hernandez and read to him the information 
filed against him, and after he finished, reading, he asked Hernandez for his 
plea and Hernandez answered 'not guilty.' After this the crowd became very noisy 
and rushed inside the court-room, throwing on us stones, hitting me and 
Hernandez several times. The judges felt powerless and they did nothing to 
suppress the mob. Both of them, Judges Saguin and Borromeo, just went outside 
their chambers and did not return anymore. Luckily the three American officers 
intervened for us at the risk of being hit by the stones thro van at us by the 
mob. I observed also that many people inside the court room were carrying 
hunting knifes, round objects wrapped in handkerchiefs, iron bars wrapped in 
newspaper with their points Obtruding, chicken blade placed in between the 
fingers. I observed also that our Filipino MP guards aid nothing to these 
persons carrying illegal weapons inside the court room.</p>
<p align="justify">"Instead two MPs went to us and tied our hands at the back very 
tightly with the sling of their carbines. With our hands tied, it became more 
difficult for us to evade the stones hurled at us. The American officers sensing 
that danger was imminent, took charge of us (Hernandez and myself). They brought 
us down the capitol building, to the truck that took us back to the provincial 
jail. I did not call for a doctor to attend to my injuries. While on the truck 
on our way to the jail, one of the MPC guard who vras with us on the truck, hit 
me at my back with the point of his carbine, and told me in harsh words that if 
I would not plead guilty the next time they would leave me to the mercy of the 
mob; and if I would not get hurt from the mob, they themselves would be the ones 
to do me harm on the pretext that I attempted to escape.</p>
<p align="justify">"As a consequence of the disturbances, eight of the ten benches 
inside the court-room were broken.</p>
<p align="justify">"The following morning February 8, 1946, Cocopate Adlawan and 
myself were brought back to the court. On our way, the guard who was sitting 
behind me, reminded me of his threats. When we arrived in the Court room, the 
crowd was the same and was very noisy. However, there were no more American 
officers inside the court room. Noting the absence of the U.S.A. officers, who 
were the only ones who could protect us from our MPC guard and the hostile 
crowd, I called my attorney, Mr. Honorato Hermossissima and informed him of my 
decision to change my plea from 'not guilty' to 'guilty'. He told me then to 
wait as he would talk with prosecutor Gatmaitan. After my attorney's conference 
with the prosecutor, he came back to me, and informed me that five of the 
charges against me were cancelled. I told him that I was going to plead guilty, 
not because I was guilty but because of the circumstances, of fear of being 
mobbed or lynched by the hostile crowd who frequented the court during trials. 
The Judges seemed to be disinterested in our safety, inasmuch as day after day 
we were assaulted by the mob in their presence, and sometimes inside the very 
court-room, and they did nothing to stop it. Antonio Racaza Racaza, Francisco 
Concepcion, Marcelo Laborte, Dionisio Agoncillo, Mateo Perez, Manuel Hernandez 
and myself were all injured. As a proof of my innocence, I told my lawyer I 
would not plead guilty to one of those grave charges against me, in count No. 
9.</p>
<p align="justify">"The court then begun with the session with my lawyer informing 
the judge with my change of plea of from 'not guilty' to that of 'guilty', 
except as to charge No. 9. The prosecutor then asked the Hon. Court to set 
the trial on charge No. 9 for the 11th of February. After I entered a plea of 
'guilty', the mob was pacified, and our guards.began to smile on me then. The 
fury of the mob was centered on my companion Cocopate Adlawan who at first did 
not plead guilty. When taken back to the court for trial, he also changed his 
plea of 'not guilty' to 'guilty' for the same reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">"On the 11th of February I was then taken to court together 
with Ignacio Calinawa, another political detainee, scheduled to be tried on that 
day also. Just before the court session begun, the attorney <i>de oficio</i>, 
Mrs. Arnoco, assigned by the court to defend Calinawa in his case, approached 
him and asked him whether he was Ignacio Calinawa. My companion answered her in 
the affirmative. And the next question was whether he had some money. Calinawa 
answered her in the negative, with an explanation that they were very poor, and 
he offered his services to his attorney if she would save him from his 
predicament. Instead his lawyer began to convince his client to plead guilty, as 
his was a hopeless case, according to her, inspite of the defendant's insistence 
that he was innocent of the charge.</p>
<p align="justify">"The judges then entered the court, and the session begun. 
Special prosecutor Attorney Gatmaitan informed the court that he was withdrawing 
Count No. 9 as a charge against me, as he himself together with Special 
prosecutor Doiciano Lambo went to Carcar, Cebu where the alleged crime was 
committed and they could not find witnesses to testify before the court, that 
the widow was demented and one of the sons was still very young, and that one of 
the principal witnesses could not be located. For these reasons, he presented a 
motion for dismissal of the case. Yet, in the decision of the court, it appears 
that I am the author of the crime specified in Count 9, inspite of the fact that 
Special prosecutor Gaitmaitan himself was the one who filed the motion before 
the court withdrawing said charge No. 9.</p>

<p align="justify">Appellant's version is corroborated by the affidavit signed by 
Dionisio Agoncillo, Francisco Concepcion, Antonio Racaza and Mateo Perez which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We, Dionisio Agoncillo, Francisco Concepcion, Antonio Racaza 
Racaza, Mateo Perez, all of legal age, Filipino citizens, political detainees, 
presently interned at the Cebu provincial jail, Cebu City, Philippines, after 
having duly sworn to in accordance with the law, do hereby depose and say:</p>
<p align="justify">"That in the morning of February 6, 1946, we, Dionisio 
Agoncillo, Francisco Concepcion, Antonio Racaza Racaza, Mateo Perez and Marcelo 
Laborte, were summoned to appear before the People's Court at the Cebu 
provincial capitol building, Cebu City, Philippines. We were escorted by (8) 
city policemen. Upon our arrival at the People's Court, we, Dionisio Agoncillo, 
Francisco Concepcion and Mateo Perez, were taken to the office of prosecutor 
Lambo; while there, we were told by prosecutor Larnbo to testify against Marcelo 
Laborte. We refused on the ground that we don't know anything about the 
activities of said Marcelo Laborte; upon our refusal prosecutor Lambo 
threateningly, told us that if we didn't testify in the prosecution against the 
said defendant, Marcelo Laborte, we would be mobbed by the civilians outside. 
These threatening words were uttered in our presence and in the presence of the 
City Police.</p>
<p align="justify">"After the trial of Antonio Racaza was over, we were all 
handcuffed, and on our way down the provincial capitol building, the city Police 
told the civilians that they could do anything against us as long as they would 
not go to the extent of killing us. The city Police were the first ones to 
manhandle us, and later the civilians followed. The civilians would not have 
manhandled us had they not been instigated by no other than the agent of our 
safety, and also by some hunters of the People's Court. As a result, all of us 
received serious physical injuries, as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"Dionisio Agoncillo was hit several times on his head, face, 
and on his back with a certain hard object wrapped with a handkerchief, which he 
presumed to be an iron bar and stones; causing physical injuries such as incised 
wound of about an inch long on his head, bruises and contussions on his face, 
and at his back; and caused him to remain on bed for three weeks.</p>
<p align="justify">"Francisco Concepcion was hit several times on his head, face, 
and on his back with stones, fists, and a certain hard object wrapped with a 
handkerchief, and clubs; causing serious physical injuries, such ass incised 
rounds about an inch long on his head, swollen right eye, bruises and 
contussions on his face, and bodily pains at his back which caused internal 
hemorrhage—vomited blood several times; and caused him to remain on bed for two 
months.</p>
<p align="justify">"Antonio Racaza was hit several times on his head, face and on 
his back with a certain hard object wrapped with a handkerchief, stones, clubs, 
and barefists; causing serious physical injuries, such as; Incised wound about 
an inch and a half long on his head, both eyes blackened, incised wound about an 
inch on his upper lip, dislocated jaw bone, bruises and contussions at his back; 
and caused him to remain on bed for one month and fifteen days.</p>
<p align="justify">"Mateo Perez was hit several times on his head, face, and on 
his back with stones, clubs and bare fists; causing serious physical injuries, 
such as: Bruises end contussions on his head and face and bodily pains at his 
back; and caused him to remain on bed for two weeks.</p>
<p align="justify">"Upon our arrival at the provincial jail, the provincial 
warden, Mr. Paulo Almendras, gave due interest to the injuries inflicted on us, 
and he himself had made all means to secure a doctor and medicines for our 
treatment; for our custodians, instead of bringing us to a hospital for 
treatment, seemed not to give us any interest. After the treatment given us by 
ihe doctor, we requested that we be given medical certificate but the doctor 
refused for obvious reasons.</p>
<p align="justify">"In view of the maltreatments and physical injuries inflicted 
on us right in the presence of the peace officers, and within the premises of 
the court—within sight of the Judges, which were interested by our government to 
give us justice, and the attitude of the Judges who seemed to be disinterested; 
and the fear of being mobbed or lynched by the hostile crowd which were 
instigated and tolerated by no other than the peace officers, makes the majority 
of our comrades believed that this kind of court was only created as a matter of 
formality, but in reality either you are innocent or guilty, you are sure to get 
stiff penalty. </p>
<p align="justify">"In view of these beliefs of some of our comrades, several of 
them had to plead guilty; firstly, to save themselves from the mobs and to 
curtail further sufferings of which they had for so long over enduring since the 
time of their internment.</p>

<p align="justify">Counsel alleges in his brief that appellant made his plea of 
guilty under physical and moral duress and that the People's Court in Cebu was 
itself evidently cowed by the populace and it could not impose a judicial order 
against the disturbances then obtaining and it quotes the following news item 
published in the April 28, 1946 issue of the "Pioneer Press" of Cebu which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"UNDERCOVER MAN BADLY INJURED</p>
<p align="justify">"Pablo Labra, considered a notorious Guadalupe undercover man 
during the Jap regime, is in critical condition as a result of the blows he had 
received yesterday morning from a furious crowd at the trial at the People's 
Court Thursday noon.</p>
<p align="justify">"The people witnessing the court trial were moved to 
indignation against Labra when Maj. Benjamin K. Gorospe, as special prosecutor 
of the PA Judge Advocate Service; vividly and dramatically fired his questions 
at the accused during the direct examination.</p>
<p align="justify">"According to the complaint, Labra, together with some kempeis, 
led a Jap Army patrol which led to the apprehension of former Governor Abellana 
and family. Abellana died at the hands of the Japanese."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">He also quotes the following editorial of the Manila "Evening 
News" of March 1, 1946.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"A DISTURBING LAPSE<br>(By Vicente Albano Pacis)</p>
<p align="justify">"In a recent decision of the People's Court there is injected 
an extraneous element that must be disturbing to all thoughtful people. It is 
embodied in the following portion of the decision of the First Division in the 
case of the People of the Philippines vs. Antonio Racaza, Criminal Case No. 
207:</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">" 'The Filipino people, indeed, abhor collaboration with the 
enemy. In the instant case as an example, a big crowd gathered at the plaza of 
the Cebu capitol, during the three days of trial, and right there the public 
showed visible indignation with an eager desire that the collaborators be dealt 
with by the court of justice without mercy.'</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It was Mr. Justice Holmes who said in the classic case of 
Patterson vs. Colorado:</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">" 'The theory of our (judicial) system is that the conclusions 
to be reached in a case will be induced only by the evidence and argument in 
open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public 
print.'</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Such a concept as this is basic and constitutes an 
indispensable limitation of the democratic theory that the majority rules. In 
the consideration of crimes—in the evaluation of evidence and interpretations of 
the law in general—only the knowledge of the law and its fair application can 
insure justice. That is why litigations are not left to town meetings but to 
courts where obtains a certain insulation from extraneous influences and where 
the points of fact and of law can be decided, in a sort of judicial vacuum. 
Popular vote may indicate confidence in issues or men but it can never 
consistently administer justice.</p>
<p align="justify">"In regard to cases of enemy collaboration, if the courts were 
to take cognizance of demonstrations such as those noted in the decision in 
question, parties concerned would sooner or later resort to all sorts of means 
of bringing about outside pressure to bear. Such a state of affairs would be 
only little removed from anarchy if not revolution.</p>
<p align="justify">"In fairness to the People's Court it should be added that, in 
the case cited, the accused not only had confessed his culpability for most of 
the crimes imputed to him but the prosecution had also presented in open court 
conclusive evidence against the accused. As the decision itself states, '* * * 
the prosecution substantiated the overt acts specified in counts Nos. 2, 3, 4, 
6, 7, 11, 12 and 13 by two competent witnesses and the rest of the (total of) 
fourteen and all of them are likewise proven through the confessions of the 
defendant in open Court.' No outside pressure was, therefore, necessary so that 
the Court would arrive at the decision it reached; namely, death of the accused 
by electrocution and a fine of P20,000. But we believe that the Court's having 
taken cognizance in its written decision of the hostile crowds around the place 
of trial constituted a disturbing lapse—an excursion into territory beyond the 
limit of objective justice."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Appellant points to the significant statement of Attorney 
Hermosisima which appears on page 9 of the transcript, made after the prosecutor 
suggested that a new arraignment be made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Prosecutor Gatmaitan: I ask that he be rearraigned on those 
counts to which he will plead guilty.</p>
<p align="justify">"Atty. Hermosisima: It will only kindle the fire again of the 
public against the accused, your Honor, and instead of promoting peace and 
order, we will only be kindling the fire again."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Considering the unusual circumstances of the case, in an effort 
to reach the bottom of the facts and circumstances surrounding the arraignment 
of the accused in which the plea of guilty was entered, at the hearing of this 
case on September 20, 1947, this Court indicated its willingness to receive 
affidavits that the appellee may file in answer to the affidavits of the 
appellants, and on October 2, 1947, appellee filed nine affidavits which are 
marked as Exhibits 1 to 9. They are reproduced below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"EXHIBIT 1</p>
<p align="justify">"I, Martina L. Arnoco, Filipino, of legal age, married, 
Register of Deeds of the Province of Cebu, and a resident of the City of Cebu, 
after having been duly sworn in accordance with law, hereby depose and say:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. That during the early part of February, 1946, I was 
appointed attorney <i>de oficio</i> of Ignacio Calinawan, one of the political 
detainees then confined in the provincial jail of Cebu, whose case was set for 
trial. At that time, the People's Court stationed in Cebu was holding session in 
the second story of the capitol building trying treason cases of Cebu political 
detainees.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. That I assisted the defendant Calinawan in the trial before 
the People's Court presided over by Judges Fortunato V. Borromeo and Florentino 
Saguin. I remember that I was in Court no less than three days as Calinawan's 
counsel, and the special prosecutor who handled the case for the government was 
Magno S. Gatmaitan.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. Inside the courtroom, the political detainees had a special 
bench with a wooden inclosure (barandilla) where they were guarded closely by MP 
guards. I also saw MP guards posted in different parts of the courtroom and in 
the premises adjoining the courtroom, in order to keep the people orderly and to 
protect the political detainees from any violence from the public. During those 
days that I was in court assisting the defendant Calinawan in his trial, the 
proceedings of the People's Court were orderly. Some people were seated on the 
benches, while those who could not be accommodated were standing behind those 
who were seated, but all behaved peacefully without creating any commotion of 
any kind. I did not see among the crowd in the courtroom any person rushing 
towards the seat of the political detainees; neither have I seen a single person 
throwing'stone, or any object at the political prisoners; neither have I seen 
any person carrying hunting knives, iron bars, clubs or any other dangerous 
weapons inside the Court.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. That the people once in a while murmured or hissed whenever 
they heard remarks not to their liking during the course of the trial, but their 
attention was called by the Judges of the People's Court and the crowd in the 
courtroom would again keep silent. In other words, during my stay in the session 
hall of the People's Court in Cebu, the trial and other court proceedings were 
conducted under the same peaceful atmosphere as that prevailing in the Court of 
First Instance of Cebu, which held trials in the same story of the capitol 
building where the People's Court was then holding its sessions.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. That with respect to the case of Ignacio Calinawan for whom 
I was appointed attorney <i>de oficio</i>, I desire to state the following: I 
accepted the appointment with reluctance, with verbal protest to Judge Fortunato 
V. Borromeo, fearing that I be criticized for handling cases of collaborators by 
my colleagues. Lawyers then did not want to handle cases of this nature. But 
having been ordered by the People's Court, I could not refuse. I did not ask any 
compensation from defendant Calinawan in order to handle his case. Neither money 
consideration was broached between him and myself. I have been in the People's 
Court no less than three times to handle his case. He was convicted by the 
People's Court and while the case was pending in the Supreme Court, I was 
notified by the Clerk of the Supreme Court to handle the case on appeal but at 
that time I mas already appointed Register of Deeds of Cebu and I manifested 
that I could not continue appearing for him in view of my official duties. It is 
not true that I persuaded defendant Calinawan to plead guilty, telling him that 
his case was hopeless. In fact, I had a heated discussion with Special 
prosecutor Magno S. Gatmaitan because he called me at his office and told me to 
persuade my client, Calinawan, to plead guilty. He showed me the array of 
evidence against Calinawan. I told him that that should better be done in open 
court and that should be done by the defendant himself if he so desired. 
Calinawan was arraigned and pleaded 'not guilty,' and so we proceeded with the 
trial of his case until it was finished in the People's Court.</p>
<p align="justify">"6. That I know the defendant Mariano T. Jaucian when he was 
yet a member of the Cebu City Secret Service before the war. I saw him in the 
courtroom of the People's Court during one of the trials of Ignacio Calinawan. I 
noticed that he had no wounds, bandage, or any sign that he was suffering from 
any physical injury. <br></p><p align="justify">"Further affiant sayeth not.</p>

<p align="justify">"I, Florencia Morcilla, of legal age, single, employee in the 
office of the provincial fiscal of Cebu, and a resident of the City of Cebu, 
after having been duly sworn according to law, hereby depose and say:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. That during the month of February, 1946, I was already 
working as Clerk in the Office of the provincial fiscal of Cebu. The main door 
of our office was facing, and until now faces, the session hall of the People's 
Court in the second floor of the capitol building of Cebu. The distance between 
the door and the sala of the People's Court is less than five meters. During the 
trials of Antonio Racaza Racaza, Mariano T. Jaucian and other notorious 
political detainees in the early part of February, 1946, I often stood at the 
door of our office when I was not busy and from there, I witnessed the 
proceedings of the People's Court presided over by Judges Fortunato V. Borromeo 
and Florentino Saguin.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. That during those days, I saw many MP guards, no less than 
eight, all armed, posted in various parts of the courtroom of the People's 
Court, some right on the sides of the detainees, some at the main door of the 
Court near the stairs which lead from the ground floor to the second floor where 
the court sessions were held. The courtroom was jammed with people eager to see 
the court proceedings. There were people even in the third floor looking down at 
the second story where the People's Court held its trials. In the crowd I saw 
several women. Oftentimes, I went nearer and mixed with the crowd in the 
People's Court room to see better what was going on.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. That during the days when Mariano T. Jaucian was in Court 
for the trial of his case, I did not see any disorder among the public. I did 
not see people carrying hunting knives, iron bars, stones or any other kind of 
deadly weapon. The MP guards were there to watch the people and to protect the 
detainees from any violence. I did not notice any commotion. I did not see 
people in the courtroom rush towards Jaucian, and their companion-detainees. I 
did not see anybody inflict bodily harm upon any one of them. The trials were 
orderly and peaceful and the people behaved well as in ordinary trials I have 
seen in the Court of First Instance of Cebu, held also in the second floor of 
the Cebu Capitol Building.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. That what I noticed was on the concrete plaza down below 
and outside the capitol building, many people who did not find accommodations in 
the courtroom of the People's Court in the second floor, because it was 
extremely crowded and warm, gathered and some of them hissed at and uttered 
unpleasant remarks about the detainees while the latter were walking across the 
concrete plaza situated between the door of the ground floor and the waiting 
truck parked on the road in front of the capitol building. Aside from these 
remarks, nothing else took place. I did not see any people in the crowd throw 
stones at, strike or manhandle the prisoners because they were escorted by MP 
guards to the waiting truck. After the political prisoners have boarded the 
truck, the MP guards boarded said car also and conducted the prisoners towards 
the provincial jail.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. That while the People's Court sessions were going on up in 
the second story, there were MP guards posted on the concrete plaza to make the 
people keep quiet whenever they caused any noise sufficient to disturb the Court 
proceeding above. <br></p><p align="justify">Further, affiant sayeth not.</p>

Command, forty years of age, married, and a resident of Cebu City, after being 
duly sworn according to law, depose and say:</p>
<p align="justify">"1. That around the first week of February, 1946, I was sent by 
Major Villanueva, the Provincial Provost Marshal, MPC, of Cebu at that time, to 
reinforce the guard at the People's Court and there were in all sixteen enlisted 
men and four MP officers. These MP's took the political detainees whose cases 
were being called for trial in the People's Court, from the provincial jail to 
the capitol building and escorted them also from the capitol building back to 
the provincial jail;</p>
<p align="justify">"2. That I know Mariano T. Jaucian, one of the political 
detainees whose cases were called for trial in the People's Court on February 7, 
1946. During the court session that day, there were MP guards stationed right in 
the courtroom, no less than eight. Some were posted at the sides of the 
political detainees, others at the main door of the stairs connecting the ground 
floor and the second floor where the People's Court was holding its session, and 
some were distributed in different places in the premises of the courtroom. The 
purpose was to keep order and check arms of the people going inside the court. 
At first there were only eight guards including officers who performed duty in 
the People's Court, but due to the petition of the Judges of the People's Court 
to reinforce the MP guards, the Provincial Provost Marshal increased the number 
of MP guards in order that there would be MP guards posted in the courtroom of 
the People's Court and in the premises of the capitol building, to protect the 
detainees from mob violence;</p>
<p align="justify">"3. That on February 7, 1946, I was at the capitol building of 
Cebu together with, the MP guards. Jaucian was arraigned at that time. He was 
assisted by his counsel, Attorney Honorato Hermosisima. After the information 
was read to him by the People's Court Interpreter, Mr. Tomas H. Nery, Jr., 
Jaucian pleaded 'not guilty.' I did not see the crowd in the courtroom rush 
towards Jaucian and his fellow indictee, Hernandez. Hor did I see any people 
inside the courtroom with hunting knives, iron bars or stones. Some people 
hissed after Jaucian pleaded 'not guilty,' but they remained in their seats and 
they did not rush towards Jaucian and Hernandez. Many MP guards were there 
inside the courtroom precisely to keep order and to protect the indictees from 
any possible attack on the part of the public;</p>
<p align="justify">"4. After the arraignment of Jaucian on February 7, 1946, my MP 
guards and I boarded the weapon's carrier back to the provincial jail. No 
untoward incident happened. There was no guard on board the car who told Jaucian 
that if he would not plead 'guilty', the next time he would be brought to the 
court, he would bad be left to the mob; and that if the mob would not injure him 
the MP guards would do it on the pretext that he (jaucian) tried to escape. Had 
there been such threats uttered by any one of my guards, I would have heard them 
and I could immediately reprimand him, because precisely we were detailed there 
to protect the political detainees;</p>
<p align="justify">"5. That there were many people outside the capitol building. 
They were gathered in the plaza in front of the door leading to the ground 
floor. They had sticks and they caused a lot of noise. In fact, I had to go down 
to call them to observe order. But one of those in the crowd, Tomas Fernandez by 
name, got angry and shouted at me, calling me that I was a sympathizer of the 
undercovers. I called him down and told him to observe order because the 
People's Court was holding session the second floor. But in view of his 
aggressive attitude, I had to approach him and grab him by the shirt with the 
purpose of bringing him to the provincial fiscal, but he resisted and he tried 
to incite the crowd to violence instead. I grabbed his coat and gave him a blow 
to give the crowd, a lesson and warning. After that, the people calmed down;</p>
<p align="justify">"6. That, in the morning of February 8, 1946, Jaucian was again 
brought to the People's Court for trial of his case. However, his attorney, 
Atty. Honorato Hermosisima, manifested to the Court that Jaucian was going to 
plead 'guilty.' So the Court asked Jaucian if that is true and Jaucian confirmed 
that he was going to change his first plea of 'not guilty' to that of 'guilty.' 
The information was read and he entered the plea of 'guilty.' I did not see any 
hostile crowd inside the courtroom at that time. I did not gee any person with 
hunting knives, iron bars wrapped in newspapers or stones wrapped in 
handkerchiefs or any other weapons; otherwise, I and my MP guards would have 
arrested them right then and there;</p>
<p align="justify">"7. That when the detainees were placed on a weapon's carrier 
from the provincial jail to the capitol building, on board the weapon's carrier 
were twelve MP's with arms to protect the prisoners. As soon as they arrived in 
front of the capitol building and the detainees and the guards alighted, the 
latter escorted the detainees to the second story of the capitol building where 
the People's Court was holding sessions. There was a crowd in front of the 
capitol building which shouted and said so many unpleasant words arainst the 
detainees, but the guards kept them away and nothing happened to the detainees 
until they reached the session hall of the People's Court. Then again after the 
trials, the same political detainees were escorted by the MP's until they 
boarded the truck parked in front of the capitol building and the detainees were 
returned to the provincial jail; and</p>
<p align="justify">"8. That during the two days, February 7 and 8, 1946, that 
Jaucian was in the courtroom, I did not notice any incident which disturbed the 
orderly proceedings of the People's Court, and during those two days that I saw 
Jaucian in the courtroom I did not notice that he had any wound or any kind of 
physical injuries until he was returned to the provincial jail after having 
entered the plea of 'guilty' on February 8, 1946.</p>

him. During the course of the reading of the information to Jaucian, there was 
no extraordinary incident of any kind. The People's Court maintained order 
throughout the proceedings with respect to Jaucian's case. I saw not less than 
two Filipino MP soldiers posted right in the place where the indictees were 
seated, to keep watch over said indictees. There were also around six uniformed 
soldiers with arms posted in different parts of the courtroom, two at the main 
door leading to the second story of the building, and others distributed around

of the ground floor of the capitol building while Jaucian and the other 
political detainees were being led to the weapon's carrier. The people made a 
lot of noise and some even made unpleasant remarks towards the political 
detainees, but they could not approach the prisoners, because the MP guards were 
there watching them and, in fact, drove the people away.</p>
<p align="justify">"6. That Mariano T. Jaucian and the other political detainees 
were handcuffed up to the time when they entered the courtroom, but when they 
were already in the courtroom their handcuffs were removed upon the order of the 
Judges. Then after the session and before roing to the ground floor, the 
political detainees were again handcuffed while they were being, returned to the 
provincial jail.</p>
<p align="justify">"7. That In the morning of February 8, 1946, I was in the 
courtroom during the whole court proceedings of the People's Court. The case of 
Mariano T. Jaucian was called by the court for trial and he was accompanied by 
his lawyer, Atty. Honorato Hermosisima. Atty. Hermosisima manifested to the 
Court that his client, Mariano T. Jaucian, was going to change his plea of 'not 
guilty' to that of 'guilty.' Judge Borromeo called the accused, Jaucian, and 
asked him if the statement of his attorney that he was going to plead 'guilty' 
was true; and Jaucian manifested that it was true. Upon the order of the Court, 
I read again the information to the defendant Jaucian. To each and every count 
in the information, except one (which I do not now remember), he pleaded 
'guilty.'</p>
<p align="justify">"8. That In that morning of February 8, 1946, before the 
information was read again to defendant, Jaucian, there was quiet and order in 
the courtroom. There were many people crowded as usual with MP guards and MP 
officers near the political prisoners, at the door and in other plsces in the 
premises of the courtroom. I have not seen any person throwing stone at 
defendant Jaucian or at any other detainee inside the courtroom; nor have I see 
any person carrying iron bars or lcnives wrapped in paper, nor any prohibited 
weapon, because the MP guards were very careful while guarding the courtroom and 
its premises. If there had been people carrying prohibited weapons, they could 
have been easily noticed and they would have been arrested by the MP guards and 
officers.</p>
<p align="justify">"9. That during those two days, February 7 and 8, 1946, that 
Mariano T. Jaucian was in the courtroom, I did not notice that he had any wound 
or scratch of any kind. I can state positively this fact, because Jaucian was in 
front of me at a distance of about half a meter, and at the end of every count I 
stopped, looked at him and asked him his plea. I noticed that he had the 
appearance of a normal person, smiling once in a while without any sign of being 
forced to do anything against his will. His attorney, Honorato Hermosisima was 
always by his side during all the course of the court proceedings against 
Mariano T. Jaucian.</p>

<p align="justify">"I, Domiciano C. Lambo, of legal age, married, practicing 
attorney in the City of Cebu, formerly Special Prosecutor assigned to handle 
treason cases in the City of Cebu, together with Special Prosecutor Magno S. 
Gatmaitan, and a resident of Cebu City, after having been duly sworn in 
accordance with law, hereby testify:</p>
<p align="justify">"(QUESTIONS ASKED BY SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IGNACIO DEBUQUE.)</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Were you present during the sessions of the 5th Division of 
the People's Court held in Cebu provincial capitol, City of Cebu, on February 6, 
7 and 8, 1946?—A. Yes, sir. I was Special Prosecutor then, assigned to the City 
of Cebu.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Mariano T. Jaucian in his affidavit. Annex B attached to 
the Motion for New Trial to the Supreme Court, among other things, stated that 
on February 6, 1946, Dionisio Agoncillo, Antonio Racaza, Francisco Concepcion 
and Mateo Perez were called to your office and you told them to testify against 
an indictee named Marcelo Laborte; that they refused, alleging that they did not 
know anything about the activities of Laborte; that upon their refusal to 
testify, you told them in a threatening manner that if they would not testify 
for the prosecution against defendant Laborte, they will be mobbed by the 
civilians outside, and that those threatening words were uttered in the presence 
of the city police. What do you say about this statement?—A. That is a big lie, 
because on February 6, 1946, I did not call those people—Dionisio Agoncillo, 
Antonio Racaza, Francisco Concepcion and Mateo Perez—to my office. It is true 
that when the case of Laborte was scheduled for trial, I think, more than two 
weeks after the date when Jaucian pleaded 'guilty' before the People's Court (I 
don't remember very well the exact date), upon examining the records of the case 
of Laborte, we found out that there were some political detainees who were 
mentioned in the affidavits attached to the CIC case report against Laborte. 
When one Francisco Concepcion and two other prisoners were brought to court, I 
took occasion to question them whether they knew something about the 
pro-Japanese activities of Laborte. After each one of them answered that they 
had nothing to say against Laborte, I let them alone, and from that time on I 
never had any dealing with those people. As I said, this conference took place 
long after Jaucian had pleaded guilty.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Were there policemen present in your office at that time 
when you interviewed Dionisio Agoncillo, Antonio Racaza, Francisco Concepcion 
and Mateo Perez?—A. I interviewed only Francisco Concepcion, Dionisio Agoncillo 
and Mateo Perez. Antonio Racaza was not with them at that time. They were 
escorted by provincial guards. There were MPs also.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. During your interview with Concepcion, Agoncillo and Perez 
in February, 1946, that is more than two weeks after Jaucian had pleaded guilty, 
did you tell them that if they would not testify for the prosecution against 
Marcelo Laborte, they would be mobbed by the people?—A. No sir, that is a big 
lie; I did not tell them so.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. During the months of February and March, 1946, in the 
course of the trial of political detainee in the People's Court stationed in 
Cebu City, have you at any time threatened any political detainee who refused to 
testify for the prosecution? Have you told them that they would be left to the 
fury of the mob, because of their refusal to testify for the State?—A. No, sir. 
I am a lawyer and I have been in the fiscal's office for many years, and I know 
that is against the law.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Mariano T. Jaucian, in his affidavit marked Annex 'B' 
attached to the Motion for New Trial filed with the Supreme Court, among other 
things, said: That on February 7, 1946, he was brought to the People's Court and 
he was arraigned. After the arraignment he pleaded 'not guilty.' Thereafter, 
Manuel Hernandez, another political indictee, was arraigned and he also entered 
the plea of 'not guilty.' According to Jaucian, immediately thereafter the crowd 
in the courtroom rushed towards them, threw on them stones, hitting Jaucian and 
Hernandez several times; that the Judges felt powerless and they did nothing to 
stop the alleged mob. Luckily, three American officers intervened. The Filipino 
MPs did nothing to stop these people There were people in the courtroom, 
according to Jaucian, who carried hunting knives, round objects wrapped in 
handkerchiefs supposed to be stones, iron bars wrapped in newspapers, chicken 
blades and other deadly weapons. Do you have anything to say with respect to 
these statements of Jaucian?—A. They are all not true. The fact is, that 
although the people at that time were very much interested in the trial of the 
cases of the political detainees, inside the courtroom and in the premises of 
said courtroom, everything was peace and order. In the courtroom and outside the 
courtroom, there were plenty of MP guards in addition to the provincial guards 
and they were posted there precisely to keep order, and to exclude unruly people 
from the courtroom.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. About how many MP guards and provincial guards were inside 
the courtroom and in the courtroom premises?—A. Around twenty of them, I 
believe.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Where were the MP guards and provincial guards posted?—A. 
There were MP guards posted at every strategic corner and point of the capitol 
building and in the courtroom while the People's Court was in session; and even 
after the Court terminated its sessions, before the prisoners were sent back to 
the provincial jail, MP guards kept watch over them.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. During the arraignment of Jaucian on February 7, 1946, when 
he pleaded 'not guilty,' was he accompanied by Counsel?—A. He was defended by 
Atty. Honorato Hermosisima, considered one of the best criminal lawyers in the 
City and Province of Cebu.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Were you present in the courtroom on February 8, 1946, 
when, according to Jaucian, he changed his plea of 'not guilty' to that of 
guilty?—A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Please state briefly what proceedings were held in the 
courtroom and what atmosphere was there in the courtroom during the 
re-arraignment of Jaucian?—A. That morning, as usual, there was peace and order 
in the courtroom as the People's Court was very strict with respect to noise. 
Everything seemed quiet and orderly. Atty. Honorato Hermosisima approached and 
conferred with Special prosecutor Magno S. Gatmaitan who was near me. After the 
conference, Atty. Hermosisima informed the Court that the accused desired to 
change his plea of 'not guilty' given the day before to that of 'guilty,' except 
to one or more counts (I don't remember exactly how many). The Presiding Judge, 
Judge Fortunato V. Borromeo (I believe, he was), of the People's Court thereupon 
asked the accused whether the manifestation of his attorney was true. Jaucian 
answered that it was true. The information was again read to the accused in open 
court by Mr. Tomas H. Nery, Jr., court interpreter and special deputy clerk of 
court, and Jaucian after the reading of each count to him by Mr. Nery was asked 
whether he understood each and every allegation in the information, to which 
Jaucian answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Was he arraigned in English?—A. Yes, sir, In English; 
Jaucian spoke good English. Then he was asked by Mr. Nery whether he would plead 
'guilty' or 'not guilty,' after reading each count and Jaucian pleaded 'guilty,' 
with the exception of one or more counts (I do not remember exactly now).</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Were you able to observe the attitude of the people below 
and around the capitol building while the Court session was going on?—A. Yes, 
sir.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. What was the general attitude of the people?—A. During the 
first days of the trial of the political detainees, the people in Cebu were 
really angry at those whom they believed were responsible for their miseries 
during the Japanese occupation. There were plenty of people outside and below 
the capitol building. There were also many people inside the capitol building 
who were eager spectators of the Court proceedings. But the government 
authorities including the Judges of the People's Court had taken every 
precaution to protect those political! detainees from the indignant crowd who 
were gathered in the plaza in front of the ground floor. When the detainees came 
to Court or went back to the provincial jail after the Court sessions, they were 
accompanied by MPs and provincial guards, and in spite of the fact that the 
crowd outside the capitol building was mad, they could not do anything because 
the MP guards kept close watch over the detainees.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Do you remember of any effotts or steps taken by the Judges 
of the People's Court to appease the public in their outspoken indignation 
against the political detainees?—A. Yes, sir. The Presiding Judge of the 
Division, Judge Borromeo (now Presiding Judge of the People's Court), several 
times told the public that the Court would not open its session unless everybody 
would keep quiet, and so after the quiet was restored and everything was in 
order, the Court would begin session. One time, I remember. Judge Borromeo went 
downstairs to the plaza facing the ground floor of the capitol building and told 
the people not to make so much noise; that they should leave the cases of the 
political detainees to the Court. The people calmed down. After that, Judge 
Borromeo went upstairs to the second story where the People's Court held its 
sessions.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. Has there been any occasion during the arraignment or trial 
of any detainee by the 5th Division of the People's Court in Cebu during the 
month of February, 1946, in which an unruly crowd entered the courtroom and some 
people carried weapons like stones, iron bars, hunting knives, thereby 
disturbing the proceedings of the court?—A. No, sir; there was none of the 
kind.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. During the times that you saw Jaucian in the courtroom, did 
you notice whether he had wounds or any kind of physical injury?—A. He did not 
have any physical injury. In fact, in the courtroom Jaucian was calm, smiling 
once in a while, and appeared as usual, not worried.</p>
<p align="justify">"Q. On page 2 of the affidavit of Jaucian, Annex B, he states 
that on account of the rush of the people to the courtroom on February 7, 1946, 
eight of the ten benches inside the courtroom were broken. What do you say about 
this?—A. That is not true. Not one bench or chair was broken, because there was 
no rush of the crowd while Jaucian was being arraigned for the first time. 
Neither was there disorder when he was arraigned for the second time, when he 
pleaded 'guilty.'</p>

<p align="justify">"I, MAGNO S. GATMAITAN, being duly sworn, depose and say:</p>
<p align="justify">"That I have been asked by Solicitor Mr. Martiniano Vivo to 
give my version of the happenings in the case of the trial of Mariano Jaucian 
and that said happenings are the following to ths best of my memory: </p>
<p align="justify">"1. On 4 February 1946, said accused was arraigned on an 
amended information but the arraignment was postponed to 7 February 1946;</p>
<p align="justify">"2. On 7 February 1946 Count 3 thereof was further amended to 
charge the accused with the rape of two women, Paulina Canaya and Annia 
Alcoseba. This amendment was necessitated because the undersigned had, the day 
before, gone to Carcar, Cebu and secured evidence to sustain this amendment. The 
accused pleaded not guilty and the case was set for hearing for the following 
day;</p>
<p align="justify">"3. On the following day, 8 February 1946, the prosecution was 
ready to prove counts 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 15, with, its witnesses present in 
Court, the majority of whom were from Carcar, Cebu;</p>
<p align="justify">"4. However, Atty. Honorato Hermosisima for the accused, who 
was attorney <i>de-parte</i>, asked for permission of the Court to speak with 
the undersigned and he told the undersigned that the accused was willing to 
plead guilty provided that Counts 3 as amended, 13, 17, 18, and 20 are 
eliminated and also a certain phrase in Count 19. In that conference the 
undersigned was also requested by Atty. Hermosisima to recommend life 
imprisonment as penalty. The undersigned replied that as to the imposition of 
the penalty, he would not make any recommendation of any kind as to the 
withdrawal of the Counts mentioned, the undersigned after some study said that 
he would be willing to drop the counts mentioned except Count 3 because as to 
Count 3, the witnesses were already in the Court and were ready to testify. As 
there was no agreement, the undersigned had to call his first witness and this 
was one of the offended parties in Count 3, a young woman named Annie Alcoseba 
who walked to the witness stand. At this juncture, the accused and Atty. 
Hermosisima again had a conference and Atty. Hermosisima, after that conference 
told the undersigned that the accused was willing to plead guilty to Count 3 as 
amended and he said to the undersigned that even if the supreme penalty might be 
imposed he believes that with a plea of guilty the Supreme Court would in all 
probability change the penalty to life imprisonment. The undersigned retierated 
to him that he would not make any recommendation as to the penalty. Accordingly, 
Atty. Hermosisima announced to the Court that the accused would be willing to 
plead guilty to the full information with the exception of counts 15, 17, 18 and 
20 and the objectionable phrase in Count 19. Then the information was read one 
by one but to the surprise of the Court, the defense Attorney himself and the 
prosecution, when the reading came to Count 9 the accused insisted that he was 
not guilty on said count. Thereupon, the remainder of the information, after 
taking out the Counts 13, 17, 18 and 20 and the objectionable phrase in Count 
19, was read and the accused pleaded guilty to the same;</p>
<p align="justify">"5. Referring to the Count 9, the prosecution was not ready on 
the same and therefore upon its petition the trial was postponed to 11 February. 
On 9 February 1946, Saturday, the prosecutor went to Carcar again to secure 
evidence on this Count 9, but, notwithstanding his efforts and that of 
prosecutor Domiciano Lambo in the examination of people in the municipal 
building of Carcar and even going to the barrio concerned he was not able to 
secure sufficient evidence;</p>
<p align="justify">"6. Therefore, on 11 February 1946 he had to admit to the Court 
that he could not sustain that Count and therefore, he had to submit the case 
without proving that Count. He however stated to the Court, in view of the 
gravity of the offense charged, that he wished to satisfy the Court of the truth 
by presenting his witnesses available on the most serious charges to which the 
accused had pleaded guilty although he was fully aware that the accused was and 
is highly intelligent and the attorney was and is a leading member of the bar of 
Cebu. One reason why he said this was because he knew of the reluctance of the 
Supreme Court in affirming judgments imposing the capital punishment where no 
evidence had been taken upon a plea of guilty altho of course, he also knew that 
this was in cases where accused is ignorant and did not fully understand the 
consequence of his plea. The Court, considering thfe attitude of the accused who 
appeared to be very intelligent and who understood the charges very well, ruled 
that there was no more need. The undersigned remembers even, that the attorney 
for the accused said that there was no need to present evidence and therefore no 
more evidence was presented;</p>
<p align="justify">"7. The case was therefore submitted upon a plea of guilty to 
the information as finally amended, discarding Counts 9, 13, 17, 18, 20 and the 
phrase objected to in Count 19;</p>
<p align="justify">"8. As far as the violence of the people is concerned, the 
undersigned remembers that there were many spectators in the trial which was 
held in the second floor in the center of the provincial capitol of Cebu but the 
audience was separated from the personnel of the Court and the witnesses by a 
rope. On the counsel table, besides the prosecutors and the attorney for the 
defense, who was then a City Counsilor of Cebu interested in the proper 
administration of justice, there were regularly more or less 10 lawyers of the 
bar of Cebu and among these the undersigned remembers Messrs. Filemon Sotto, 
Roque Desquitado and Manuel Zosa. There were times really when the audience was 
very noisy but other than this the proceedings inside the court room were in 
order and the accused being seated towards the right of the court room, rather 
far from the audience. The undersigned can certify that there was no violence at 
all inside the court room, and certainly there was no throwing of stones 
therein;</p>
<p align="justify">"9. However, the undersigned remembers that there was a 
commotion on the road immediately in front of the capitol building sometime in 
the morning after the hearing on February 6, but, the undersigned remembers that 
the accused Mariano Jaucian was not then present as his case was not scheduled 
at that time but the case of Antonio Racaza ;</p>
<p align="justify">"10. At no time so far has the undersigned remembers was the 
accused, Mariano Jaucian the subject of any violence either on Febraary 4 when 
he came to the court for arraignment or on the 7th of February when he pleaded 
not guilty or on the 8th of February when the case was postponed or on the 11th 
of February when the case was finally submitted. The undersigned remembers that 
accused; Mariano Jaucian was a handsome man of mestizo type always dressed in 
clean and smart polo shirt and it could easily be seen if he had been hurt;</p>
<p align="justify">"11. As to alleged intimidation, the undersigned remembers 
perfectly well the several times when said accused insisted on the 8th of 
February to the falsity of Count 9, so that the prosecution had to ask to 
postpone the hearing on that Count 9 to 11 February;</p>
<p align="justify">"12. As to the knowledge of the accused that he might be given 
the death penalty notwithstanding his plea of guilty, all that the undersigned 
can say is that the attorney for the accused mentioned to the undersigned that 
he feared that the People's Court might really impose upon his client the death 
penalty but that he had hopes that by his plea of guilty, the Supreme Court in 
all probability would commute the sentence to life imprisonment;</p>
<p align="justify">"13. The undersigned has been informed that the defense in the 
Supreme Court has made capital of some statements made by the undersigned during 
the course of the trial in which he referred to his consultation with the 
reputable members of the province of Cebu bar, and that his decision to 
eliminate Count 9 was upheld by the townspeople of Carcar (p. 15; Brief of the 
Appellant, p. 24). The reason why the prosecutor made those statements can be 
understood if the following facts are considered;</p>
<p align="justify">"He arrived by plane in Cebu on 1 February 1946 in the 
afternoon; with instructions from Solicitor-General Tañada to secure the moral 
support of the people as much as possible in the prosecution of cases and to use 
his discretion in maintaining that moral support because the prosecution's 
efficiency depends on public support; he was scheduled to prosecute some 25 
cases congested in a calendar of three weeks; he had not interviewed a single 
witness before he arrived in Cebu; the overt acts in the Information covered 
various towns and remote barrios of Cebu; when he arrived in Cebu, there was not 
even sufficient sccomodation; he had to study by candle light; cases were to be 
heard on February 4 so that he had only two clays to prepare. Under the 
circumstances he had to depend upon his ingenuity to interview as many persons 
as possible and he took pains even to appeal to the general public. He went to 
Carcar on February 2 and to remote barrios therein; to Mandate on February 4, 
again to Carcar on February 6 and again on February 9. These towns were 
sufficiently far from the City of Cebu. While he was able to make hurried 
preparations under the circumstances and to bring witnesses on particular counts 
in the first trials, he however, felt that it was possible that several people 
in the court room and also reputable members of the bar who were present might 
be able to help him. He therefore, used his discretion to make time and again 
statements in open court and in public audiences which he calculated would 
secure from these who might know the facts necessary support and cooperation, 
These statements were made by him not because he was influenced by the public 
opinion but because by pleasant diplomatic strokes, he wanted to create an 
atmosphere favorable to his efforts of securing evidence. So in the 
investigation he had in the municipal building of Carcar, Cebu on 9 February, a 
Saturday afternoon, he appealed to the public of Carcar present in the municipal 
building to give him all the evidence and information that might help him in 
establishing Count 9. Thus he said in public in the municipal building of Carcar 
that he wished everyone present to know that he would listen to evidence from 
anybody concerned but that if no one could give evidence he would be compelled 
to drop the count. The people tried to help him but they could not give him 
sufficient evidence. They however, indicated to him how to go to the barrio of 
the crime and accompanied by a municipal policeman he went to that barrio and 
tried his best even though it was already evening to secure evidence but, he 
failed;</p>
<p align="justify">"14. The undersigned came to feel that there was a strong but 
responsible public opinion against collaborators in Cebu, but the personal 
violence inflicted on some prisoners (and accused Mariano Jaucian was not one of 
them), was done only by some irresponsible mischief makers far from the court 
room and on the road immediately in front of the provincial capitol. If the 
undersigned had only believed during the entire proceeding against Mariano 
Jaucian that intimidation or force had been employed upon him to plead guilty he 
would have insisted in the presentation of the evidence just the same because 
the witnesses were present on Counts 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 15, and he was aware as a 
prosecutor that if the death penalty was imposed, the case would have to be 
taken to the Supreme Court for review and if the Supreme Court would have been 
convinced that there was no voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty, the case 
would have to be remanded for new trial with the consequence that in the 
interval something may have happened to his witnesses.</p>

say:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. That I have been asked by Solicitor Mr. Martiniano Vivo to 
give what I remember of the proceedings in the case against Mariano Jaucian 
because, according to him said accused challenges the validity of the trial on 
the ground that there was violence and that he had only been compelled to plead 
guilty.</p>
<p align="justify">"2. That so far as the undersigned remembers, there was really 
a strong public opinion against collaborators in Cebu; the undersigned being 
himself from that province; but, to say that the mob violence dominated the 
trial in that case is not really the truth.</p>
<p align="justify">"3. The truth is that as far as the undersigned remembers, the 
proceedings inside the court room were regular; the undersigned noticed that the 
accused who was apparently a very intelligent man, was acting with full 
voluntariness and consciousness of his acts and his lawyer appeared to be a very 
intelligent attorney. In the court room on the counsel table, there were about a 
dozen lawyers from Cebu who saw the entire proceedings. There was one instance 
when the accused insisted in denying one of the counts and this convinced the 
judges all the more that he was not under any compulsion whatever.</p>
<p align="justify">"4. In the beginning of the trial the undersigned remembers 
that the attorney for the accused, Mr. Honorato Hermosisima, wanted to have a 
private talk with the judges. (Afterwards we came to learn that he had wanted to 
see our view to imposing life imprisonment instead of death upon a plea of 
guilty), but surmising that he wanted us to give him in private a moral 
assurance to that effect, we did not permit that and just told him that he could 
confer with the prosecutor and this was what he did and at the beginning 
apparently they could not agree because the prosecutor called is witness and one 
of them was a young woman, but, when the prosecutor apparently intended to go 
ahead with the case, the accused called his lawyer and they conferred and later 
on the lawyer said that he would plead guilty to the same information discarding 
only several counts which he mentioned.</p>
<p align="justify">"5. When the prosecutor agreed to that statement, the 
information was read again and to our surprise, upon reaching one of the counts, 
not excepted by him in the plea of guilty, the accused insisted on a plea of 
<i>not guilty</i> to that count so that the trial could not take place on that 
count and had to be postponed on that day because the prosecutor said that he 
was not ready on evidence on that particular count that same day. When the day 
of trial came the prosecutor withdrew that count because he said that after an 
investigation in Carcar, he could not sustain that count.</p>
<p align="justify">"6. So far as the charge that there was mob violence is 
concerned, the undersigned can certify that there was really a disturbance in 
front of the provincial capitol, around 40 meters distant from the main entrance 
thereof, after one of the trial in the case of another prisoner, Antonio Racaza, 
but, the accused, Mariano Jaucian was not connected at all with that case, and 
his trial was not on that day but on another day. What the undersigned actually 
saw on one or two occasions was that when the prisoners, the trial, in order to 
be taken back to the provincial jail, a large number of people lined up along 
the patio of the provincial capitol. As the prisoners, guarded by the MP's 
passed along on their way to the truck that was to take them, the crowd 
attempted to mob the prisoners and some of them stoned them. The MP's guarding 
the prisoners defended them and were able to disperse the crowd only after they 
threatened to shoot them. The distance along which the people were lined up from 
the mainentrance of the capitol to the place where the prisoners could be loaded 
on the truck is approximately 40 to 50 meters.</p>

Mariano Jaucian, that he was under compulsion or that he had suffered any 
injury, he would not have permitted the prosecution to submit its case without 
presenting any evidence. But from his appearances, Mariano Jaucian was acting 
voluntarily and very intelligently and he had not been the receiver of any 
injury throughout the course of his trial. And therefore, considering the fact 
that his plea of guilty was made freely and intellicently and he was assisted by 
a very reputed member of the Cebu bar and as the People's Court had on its hands 
many other cases, the Court believed that there was no more use of the 
presentation of the evidence for the prosecution on the counts to which he had 
pleaded guilty.</p>
<p align="justify">"8. In the imposition of the penalty, the Court believed that 
they could not do anything but impose the death penalty because at least four of 
the charges so far as the undersigned remembers, were capital crimes without any 
extenuating circumstances except his plea of guilty, and there concurred several 
aggravating circumstances.</p>

<p align="justify">The Supreme Court devoted considerable time in analyzing and 
weighing the circumstance under which appellant entered his plea of guilty, and 
the members have been evenly divided on the question as to whether or not the 
case should be remanded, to the lower court for a new trial because, as 
contended by appellant's counsel, the plea of guilty was entered into under 
physical and moral duress, against which the lower court was not able to protect 
him.</p>
<p align="justify">Some Justices are of opinion that there is convincing evidence 
on record to show that appellant was the victim of mistrial and, therefore, the 
case should be heard again in the trial court, by setting aside the appealed 
judgment. Other Justices believe that the disturbances complained of have not 
affected the freedom of appellant to properly defend himself and to plead guilty 
or not guilty, and his plea upon which the trial court rendered judgment was 
entered by him voluntarily.</p>
<p align="justify">Because no one side could muster a decisive majority, the 
undersigned, who was one among those who upheld appellant's contention as to 
mistrial due to mob violence, decided to break the deadlock by joining the side 
which will uphold the plea of guilty of the appellant, so as to constitute a 
majority that would convict appellant by modifying the penalty from death to 
that of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">In making this shift, we have carefully considered the 
contentions in appellant's brief and came to the conclusion that appellant does 
not pretend that he is innocent of the crime of treason for which he is accused. 
He complains of mistrial because had it not been for it he would not have been 
sentenced to death, his argument being premised on an unmistakable admission of 
his guilt, and, therefore, his main purpose in securing a new trial is to escape 
the penalty of death. In view of the division of opinion among the members of 
this Court death cannot be imposed on appellant. Appellant's purpose in seeking 
a new trial is attained in a more speedy and direct way by rendering this 
decision which substitutes the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to that of 
death.</p>
<p align="justify">A new trial may satisfy technical requirements of procedure, 
but with it appellant will not attain better objective than the modification of 
penalty decreed in this decision. The machinery of justice should not be clogged 
by empty and useless technicalities. These should not be allowed to hamper 
speedy justice, when the substantial rights of the parties are duly guaranteed 
and protected.</p>
<p align="justify">Wnerefore, finding appellant criminally responsible of treason, 
upon the facts stated in the counts of the amended information to which he 
pleaded guilty, he is sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> instead of death 
and, with this modification, the appealed judgment is affirmed.</p>

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p align="justify">TUASON, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">I vote to remand this case for a new trial.</p>
<p align="justify">It is clear beyond dispute that the defendant's plea of guilty 
was forced by fear of a mob. Spirit of mob violence asserted itself during 
several-day trial from beginning to end. It obtained outside and inside the 
court, at times in the presence of the judges. A large and an unruly crowd it 
was, armed with clubs, knives, stones, etc., which congregated in and about the 
courthouse and which not only threatened the accused but actually inflicted 
physical injuries on him arid other treason indictees. One of these was laid in 
bed as a result of the assault.</p>
<p align="justify">It was a sad commentary on the good sense of the judges and the 
law officers in charge of the prisoner that they seem to have looked upon the 
demonstrations with complacency, lifting not a finger to stop them. It fell upon 
the lot of two American army officers, who happened to be present in the 
courtroom at one stage of the trial, to quell the mob and protect the accused, 
from its fury. But what is more serious is that the court seems to have been 
swayed by the demonstrations, if its decision in a sister case, People vs. 
Antonio Racaza ,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> one of the victims of 
the same mob, is any indication. The court in that case noted with apparent 
approval and sympathy the crowd's "visible indignation with an eager desire that 
the collaborators be dealt with by the court of justice without mercy." And 
without mercy, they were dealt <i>with</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">Thus the appellant was denied freedom to plead. His conviction 
under the circumstances is illegal and void. It was nullified by mental fear and 
terror of uncontrolled attacks. The vilest of criminals under the Constitution 
are entitled to defend themselves against accusation for crime under an 
atmosphere free from menaces of harm, undue passion and emotionalism, and before 
judges unafraid and uninfluenced by outside clamor or pressure. The decision in 
this case would deprive the appellant of his life or liberty without due process 
of law. There is no due process when there is actual interference with the court 
of justice and the defendant is deprived of a fair ana impartial trial according 
to law. The accused is entitled to something more than the mere pretense of a 
trial.</p>
<p align="justify">I take particular exception, to the proposition that simply 
because the court believes the appellant is guilty anyway and a new trial would 
produce the same result, irregularities of the kind above noted should be 
overlooked for the sake of speedy justice. The constitutional guarantee against 
punishment for crime without due process of law admits of no exception. It can 
not be sacrificed upon the altar of expediency or speedy justice or upon any 
other consideration. This right lies at the foundation of human rights and 
democratic institutions to which the Constitution is dedicated.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, the right to speedy trial is essentially alright of 
accused. If an accused, on trial for his life, fully aware of the delay which a 
new hearing would entail, asks for such hearing, that is his concern, not the 
court's. This right is not an "empty and useless technicality" to be cast aside 
when it gets in the way "to clog the machinery of justice," as if there could be 
justice without the observance of this "empty and useless technicality;" as 
though, in other words, the machinery of justice was devised for the benefit of 
the prosecution, of the court, or of the government, and not of the accused.</p>
<p align="justify">This case is of far-reaching importance. It not only affects 
the appellant's life and liberty but it sets a rule for future guidance of 
courts and would be mobsters who would take the law into their hands out of the 
hands of the court that tries them. This is one case in which this Court must 
make known its condemnation in energetic terms of any interference with the 
administration of justice, and must tell judges that it is their bounden duty to 
initiate the suppression of disturbances directly intended to accomplish this 
end. If courts are to maintain their dignity and self-respect, the 
constitutional rights of accused preserved, and mob rule in this country nipped 
in the bud.</p>
