				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Alfredo Fundador and his son Aceeleb Fundador are appealing from the decision 
of the Court of First Instance of Negros Oriental finding them guilty of murder, 
and sentencing each of them to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to Indemnify jointly 
the heirs of the deceased Inocenclo Campaner in the amount of P4,000.00, and to 
pay the costs.
<p>While the evidence for the prosecution and the defense as to the 
responsibility for the death of Inocenclo Campaner are conflicting, there Is no 
conflict as to t he following facts. About noon on December 21, 1951, or shortly 
thereafter, Inocencio Campaner was brought by Nicaslo Marlbao, ranking rural 
policeman and Santos Sigoy, another rural policeman to the house of appellant 
Alfredo Fundador, then lieutenant of the barrio of Pacu-an, municipality of La 
Libertad, Negros Oriental. That evening Cainpaner died as a result of serious 
physical Injuries which produced Internal hemorrhage. He was buried the 
following day, not in the town cemetery but beneath a clump of bamboo trees 
about half kilometer from the house of Alfredo. His death was not reported by 
Alfredo to the authorities. The same day of the burial, Campaner's mother 
complained to the Chief of Police who later detailed Sgt. Mariano Rendal of the 
police force to conduct an investigation. Because it was already late, Rendal 
proceeded to the barrio of Pacu-an the following day, questioned Alfredo, had 
the corpse exhumed and taken to the Poblacion where it was autopsied by Dr. Juan 
S. Castillo, President of the Sanitary Division, who thereafter issued a medical 
certificate (post mortem report), Exhibit "A" which we reproduce below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"December 24, 1951</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Medical Certificate of Inocencio Campaner (Post-Mortem)</p>
<p>TO : Whom it may concern</p>

<p align="right">(Sgd.) JUAN S. CASTILLO<br>President, 2nd San. 
Division"</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the evidence for the prosecution which was accepted by the trial 
court, in the morning of December 21, 1951, Nicasio Maribao was Informed that 
tpere was a man hiding in a cave in the sltio of Mambulao. Marlbao asked his 
informer to return and watch further developments around the cave while he went 
to inform barrio lieutenant Alfredo who told him to go to the cave and verify 
the information. Accompanied by Santos Sigoy, another rural policeman, Marlbao 
on approaching the cave saw Campaner already outside of it and when questioned 
as to what he was doing in the cave, he answered that being tired he went there 
to rest. Maribao dispatched Sigoy to inform Alfredo that the man in the cave was 
Campaner and Sigoy came back with the order of Alfredo to arrest and tie up 
Campaner and bring him to Alfredo's house, which was done, Campaner arrived at 
Alfredo's house healthy and without any physical injuries. Upon order of 
Alfredo, Campaner's hands were untied and he sat on a bench In the waiting room. 
Then the other defendant Acceles, son of Alfredo entered the waiting room and 
approaching Campaner addressed him thus: "By gosh, if these were still the 
guerrilla dajys, I could make you dig your own grave and then bury you in it." 
Campaner did not answer. After eating his lunch in the kitchen Alfredo entered 
the sala, had the clothes of Campaner removed to see if he had any concealed 
weapons and finding none then proceeded to accuse Campaner, charging him with 
the theft of the horse of one Mario Lacson and later selling it to one Jose 
Gallosa, using Alfredo's name so as to Induce Gallosa to buy the horse. Campaner 
denied the charge saying that he; merely used the horse to go to Isabela and 
that upon arriving there Gallosa took the horse, claiming it as his own. Then 
rural policeman Maribao and Sigoy prepared to leave, at the same time suggesting 
to Alfredo to take Campaner to the poblacion for further investigation, but 
Alfredo said "not yet, maybe tomorrow because I have yet many questions to ask 
him." Before they left the two were ordered to again tie thie hands of Campaner 
lest he escape:. Shortly after leaving the house and not far from it the two 
policemen observed that the door and the windows of the house of Alfredo were 
being closed and almost immediately thereafter they heard sounds of gasping or 
moaning which they recjognlzed as coming from Campaner, and also dull noises as 
of blows. At about ten o'clock that night Acceles Fundador went to the house of 
Maribao asking him to come to the house of his father because Campaner was in 
pain and was being given first aid. Maribao went as requested but found Campaner 
already dead, with his forehead, neck and abdomen swollen. Because It was too 
late to render any aid Marlbao went home but the following morning lie was again 
called to help bury the cadaver. He again complied with the request, calling on 
Sigoy and others to help. At the house of Alfredo they prepared the body for 
burial, at the same time suggesting that the body be taken to the town cemetery 
for internment but Alfredo said that there was no necessity of burying the body 
in the town cemetery, and that it was his order that it be burled near the 
bamboo clump.. Then someone suggested that the case be reported to the town 
authorities to which Alfredo answered that there was no need to report the 
matter because there was no aggrieved party and that should there be one in the 
future he was there to answer. Then he said or made the warning that if any one 
should complaln or squeal and make gossip he would have him arrested. Emigdio 
Embajada, assistant barrio lieutenant suggested that the matter be reported to 
the town authorities otherwise danger but Alfredo cut him short, saying Alfredo 
would be in danger but Alfredo cut him short, saying "do not talk too much about 
it, because you do not know anything about the law." Roberto de la Cruz and 
Dominador Bihik aged 15 and 13, respectively, friends of Wilson Fundador aged 12 
and son of defendant Alfredo Fundador said that they were informed by Wilson 
that there was a robber in the house of his father and he invited them to come 
and see. Accepting the invitation to satisfy their boyish curiosity, Roberto and 
Dominador went to Wilson's house about two o'clock in the afternoon of December 
21st, They saw Acceles Fundador pull Campaner who had his hands tied, to the 
middle of the sala and there upon order of his father Alfredo, repeatedly box 
him. Alfredo encouraged Acceles to continue with the maltreatment saying: "Go 
ahead, box him. Anyway, if he dies, we would know how to assume the soul of the 
man." After receiving blows on both hips and the upper part of the abdomen 
Campaner fell heavily on the floor, flat on his face, The two boys were scared 
by what they saw and left the house.</p>
<p>The theory of the defense supported by the testimony of several witnesses, 
including Acceles and Wilson, sons of Alfredo, was that Campaner was maltreated 
by Maribao, Sigoy and their companions before he was taken to the house of 
Alfredo, because Campaner was suspected of having stolen chickens belonging to 
one1 of the group. This was rejected by the trial court. </p>
<p>As to who was really responsible for the ill-treatment of Campaner which 
resulted In his death, depends on which set of witnesses, prosecution or defense 
is to be believed. After studying the evidence we find nothing In the record 
that would warrant lnterferrlng with the findings of the trial court, based on 
the credibility of witnesses, we quote with favor certain portions of the 
decision appealed from on this point: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Court, during the trial of this case, had closely observed the manner 
and demeanor of the witnesses, both for the prosecution and the defense, when 
they testified. It has scrutinized closely the utterances of the said witnesses 
and found that the witnesses for the defense, in most instances, have been 
unnatural and their statements were beset with improbabilities. The supposed 
principal witness, Pedro Villeres, due perhaps to his great desire to save the 2 
accused from the criminal charge and after evading some questions of the Fiscal 
on cross-examination, stated without being asked that he was telling only what 
he knew about the case without adding or subtracting anything therefrom. This 
witness would like this Court to believe that he actually slept In the house of 
Alfredo Fundador In that evening of December 21, 1951, but which the Court Is 
not ready to accept, considering that his house was just In an adjoining barrio 
and he could have returned or proceeded to his house that very afternoon or that 
evening to join his family from whom he was away for days. In many Instances, 
this witness, as well as the other witnesses for the defense, have made serious 
contradictions In their testimonies. He further asserted that when Campaner and 
the 4 persons, who allegedly maltreated him, arrived at the house of Alfredo 
Campaner (should be Fundador). he was already there sitting. This Is contrary to 
the testimonies of the other witnesses of the defense as well as the prosecution 
that Inocencio Campaner was brought to the house of Alfredo Fundador at 2;00 
o'clock or thereabout, while this witness arrived in said house very much 
later,</p>
<p>"Wilson Fundador, one of the sons of Alfredo Fundador, while testifying 
seemed to have committed to memory the facts he had testified to during the 
trial. He admitted that he was asked by his father, one of the accused herein, 
to relate to him the same facts several times, the last time was on October 21, 
1952, the day before the date of trial, when he testified in Court, and while 
they were already in the City of Dumaguete. He also declared that his sister, 
Adoracion, was in their house during the whole day of December 21, 1951, when as 
a matter of fact, as testified to by Adolencia de la Cruz, she and Adoracion 
arrived in the house of Alfredo Fundador late in the afternoon or already 
twilight on December 21, 1951.</p>
<p>"A further examination of the evidence adduced by the defense, as testified 
to by the witnesses, will show many other contradictions, besides those already 
mentioned. The defense of Acceles Fundador is, more or less, an alibi. He wanted 
to impress the Court that from the morning of December 21 up to 5:00 o'clock in 
the afternoon of the same day, he was not in his house, because he was sent by 
his father to look for tobacco seedlings. His assertion, however, is belied by 
all the witnesses for the prosecution who were there in their house from noon up 
to afternoon of that day of December 21, 1951, until Inocencio Campaner has been 
boxed and maltreated by him several times. The defense of alibi may not prevail 
over the testimony of at least 2 witnesses who saw the accused inflict the 
injuries that caused the death of the victim; x x x.</p>
<p>"It Is surprising that while the accused Acceles Fundador was made to take 
the witness stand, the defense did not see it fit to present the other accused 
Alfredo Fundador to deny or counteract the testimonies of the prosecution 
witnesses against him. The prosecution, with its evidence, points to Alfredo 
Fundador as the principal accused by inducement for the death of Inocencio 
Campaner. It has not been established or shown that the witnesses for the 
prosecution had some grudges or ill-feeling against Alfredo Fundador, a barrio 
lieutenant - a prominent citizen of the barrio of Pacu-an - that might have 
induced said witnesses to: testify falsely against him and his son, as the 
defense wanted the Court to believe. It has been insinuated by Acceles Fundador 
that Roberto de la Cruz and Dominador Bihic must have testified in the way they 
did, because of certain misunderstandings about the borrowing of corn or some 
money by the fathers of those 2 boys from the accused Alfredo Fundador. The 
Court, however, could not give credit to this assertion because it is even 
improbable that these 2 boys must have known anything about the dealings of 
their (respective fathers with the! accused Alfredo Fundador."</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, as well observed by the Solicitor General, if Maribao and his 
Companions as contended by the defense really manhandled Campaner to the extent 
of pracltically killing him, they would not have exposed the crime by taking the 
victim to the house of the barrio lieutenant Alfredo, and Carapaner would have 
been unable to walk as he did from the cave to the house of Alfredo; and that if 
this maltreatment by the two rural policemen had really taken place, their chief 
barrio lieutenant Alfredo would have reprehended them for it and would have 
reported the matter to the town authorities. But as it was Alfredo never 
reported Campaner's death to the poblacion; and he even ordered the the body 
buried near a bamboo grove in the barrio instead of inside the town cemetery; 
and when Sgt. Rendal came to investigate the death, Alfredo failed to give any 
satisfactory explanation, thereby compelling Rendal to order the exhumation of 
the body which was done; and after due investigation by Rendal, the Chief of 
Police and the Fiscal, these officials were convinced that it was not Maribao 
and Sigoy and their companions but rather Alfredo and his son Acceles who were 
responsible for the cruel maltreatment of Campaner, and no these last two were 
charged with murder. The fact that Alfredo Fundador failed to take the witness 
stand to deny the damaging testimony against him and his son Acceles or to 
impute the maltreatment to Maribao, Sigoy and his companions, is also 
significant. Although under the law, he was under no obligation to testify, 
under the circumstances it was rather strange why he did not take the witness 
stand to counteract or explain the damaging evidence against him and his 
son.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we are convinced that as found by the trial court, the 
witnesses for the prosecution were more worthy of credence; that the 
maltreatment and death of Inocenclo Campaner occurred as testified to by them, 
and that appellants Alfredo and Acceles are guilty of the crime of murder with 
which they were charged. The decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with the 
modification suggested by the Solicitor General that the indemnity be paid by 
appellants jointly and severally. With costs.</p>
