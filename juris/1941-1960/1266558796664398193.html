				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1606, May 28, 1949</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF YEE BO MANN FOR PHILIPPINE CITIZENSHIP. YEE BO MANN, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for naturalization.
<p align="justify">Petitioner Yee Bo Mann was born in Canton, China, in 1898, of 
Chinese parents, who at an earlier date had become naturalized citizens of the 
United States. In 1915 he immigrated to the Philippines and located in the City 
of Cebu, where he has resided continuously since then. Studying in the public 
schools there and completing the primary and secondary courses, including a 
four-year commercial course, he became a licensed public accountant in 1925 and 
has since then engaged in the practice of that profession in addition to being a 
general merchant and purchasing agent. In 1922 he married Helen Leu, an American 
citizen born in Hawaii, and with her came to have two children, Nellie and 
Philip, born in 1924 and 1933, respectively. Nellie took her primary course 
partly in Hongkong and partly in Cebu and was at the time of the trial a high 
school student in the Saint Theresa College in that city, a school recognized by 
the Government. Philip was enrolled in a public school.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner believes in the principles underlying the Philippine 
Constitution and can speak and write English and the Cebu Visayan dialect. He is 
not a polygamist and has never been convicted of any crime involving moral 
turpitude. He has a sister who is married to a Filipino, Atty. Manuel Veloso, 
and he has no more relatives in China. Asked why he wanted to become a Filipino 
citizen, he answered: "I have been here so long, I was educated here, I have so 
many Filipino friends and I love them and they love me too." He says he has 
already decided to spend the rest of his life in the Philippines.</p>
<p align="justify">The Court of First Instance of Cebu granted the petition, and 
the case is now here on appeal by the Government on the ground that petitioner 
has failed to declare his intention to become a Filipino citizen one year before 
the filing of his petition and to prove at the trial that the laws of China 
permit Filipinos to naturalize in that country.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the first ground, section 5 of the Revised Natrualization 
Law requires an applicant for naturalization to declare his intention to become 
a Filipino citizen one year before the application. But section 6 of the same 
law exempts from that requirement, among others, those who have resided 
continuously in the Philippines for 30 years or more before the filing of their 
application, provided "that the applicant has given primary and secondary 
education to all his children in the public schools or in private schools 
recognized by the Government and not limited to any race or nationality." The 
Solicitor General construes this proviso as requiring completion of both primary 
and secondary education by all the children of the applicant. This court, 
however, has already held in other cases, among them that of Rafael Roa 
Yrostorza vs. Republic of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G. R. No. L-1394, that enrollment in the 
proper school is sufficient compliance with the law. Petitioner's case comes 
within this ruling, since his children are actually studying in school albeit 
they have not yet finished secondary education.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the other ground of appeal, it appears that petitioner 
has presented in evidence a translation of the Chinese naturalization law 
certified to be correct by the Chinese Consulate General in Manila. The 
admissibility of this evidence is challenged on the ground that it does not 
conform to section 41, Rule 123 of the Rules of Court. The objection is of no 
moment, since this Court has already accepted it as a fact in previous 
naturalization cases that the laws of China permit Filipinos to naturalize in 
that country.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is 
affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Tuason,</i> 
and <i>Montemayor, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">Reyes, J.:</p>
<p align="justify">I hereby certify that Chief Justice Moran voted for the 
affirmance of the judgment below.</p>
