				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendants in these twelve cases were each charged with violation of 
Municipal Ordinance No. 4, series 1944, enacted by the Municipal Council of 
Tacloban, Leyte, which provides the following:
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. It shall be unlawful for any person, association, or firm, to 
manufacture, distill, produce, cure, sell, barter, offer or give or dispose of 
in favor of another, possess or to have under control any intoxicating liquor, 
drink or beverage, locally manufactured, distilled, produced or cured wine, 
whiskey, gin, brandy and other drink containing liquor including tuba. </p>
<p>"SEC. 2. All permits and licenses issued for the manufacture, production or 
establishment or distileries and sale of tuba, wine, whiskey, and other 
alcoholic beverages, are hereby revoked and cancelled. </p>
<p>"SEC. 3. Any person, association or firm, who violates the provisions of this 
ordinance, shall be punished, upon conviction by competent court, by a fine of 
not less than one hundred pesos nor more than two hundred pesos and imprisonment 
of not less than three months nor more than six months. In case of a reincidence 
or second offense committed, the violator shall suffer the maximum penalty 
herein prescribed, and in the event of insolvency, the violator shall suffer 
imprisonment of one day for each one peso fine imposed in addition to the 
imprisonment already imposed thereof by the court. </p>
<p>"SEC. 4. Any provisions of municipal ordinance, rules and regulations, which 
are inconsistent hereof, are hereby repealed, void and null. </p>
<p>"SEC. 5. This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its approval.</p>
<p>"Approved, December 2, 1944."</p></blockquote>
<p>The informations filed against Timoteo Esguerra, Criminal Case No. 2 of the 
Court of First Instance of Leyte, G. R. No. L-501, and against Teofilo 
Decatoria, criminal Case No. 4 of the same court, G. R. No. L-502, charged that 
each of said defendants did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, aid 
feloniously sell, barter, convey, offer, give, or dispose of whisky or 
intoxicating liquor to or in favor of soldiers of the United States Army, which 
wine or intoxicating liquor the accused had then in their possession and under 
their custody and control without any legal authority to do so. </p>
<p>The informations against Jose Chan, criminal case No. 7 of the Court of First 
Instance of Leyte, G.R. No. L-505, Felix Labordo, criminal case No. 15, G.R. 
L-510, and Pilar E. Pascual, criminal case No. 16, G.R. No. L-511, and against 
the defendants in other seven (7) separate cases, charged the defendants with 
having, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, had ,in their possession and 
under their control and custody '"tuba" or intoxicating liquor without any legal 
authority to do so.</p>
<p>The cases against Timoteo Esguerra, Jose Chan, Felix Labordo, and Pilar E. 
Pascual were jointly heard, and the defendants moved for the dismissal of the 
charge on the ground that the Ordinance No. 4, Series 1944, which, according to 
the information, was by them violated is null and void, because the municipal 
council of Tacloban, Leyte, had no power to enact it. The lower court, after 
hearing the arguments of the prosecution and the defense, declared the ordinance 
in question null and void, and dismissed the cases against the said defendants; 
and also dismissed the cases against the defendants in all other cases, 
presumably because the ordinance which penalizes as an offense the selling, 
bartering, offering, giving away or dispensing of liquors, having been declared 
null and void, the part of the same ordinance which penalizes the possession, 
custody and control of liquors had to be declared null and void also, since the 
latter cannot be separated from the former. </p>
<p>The prosecuting attorney in behalf of the plaintiff the People of the 
Philippines appealed from the decision of the lower court in the twelve cases, 
and all of them are now before us on appeal. </p>
<p>The appellant contends that the ordinance at bar was enacted by virtue of the 
police power of the Municipality of Tacloban conferred by the general welfare 
clause, section 2238 of the Revised Administrative Code, and is therefore 
valid. Said section reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 2238. <em>General power of council to enact ordinances and make, 
regulations.</em> — The municipal council shall enact such ordinances and make 
such regulations, not repugnant to law, as may be necessary to carry into effect 
and discharge the powers and duties conferred upon it by law and such as shall 
seem necessary and proper to provide for the health and safety, promote the 
prosperity, improve the morals, peace, good order, comfort, and convenience of 
the municipality and the inhabitants thereof, and for the protection of property 
therein." </p></blockquote>
<p>We are of the opinion, and so hold, that the lower court has not erred in 
declaring the ordinance No. 44, Series I944, <em>ultravires</em> and therefore 
null and void. Under the general welfare clause, Sec. 2238 of the Revised 
Adninistrative Code, a municipal council may enact such ordinances, <em>not 
repugnant to law</em>, as shall seem necessary and proper to provide for the 
health and safety, etc., of the inhabitants of the municipality. , But as the 
ordinance in question prohibiting the selling, giving away and dispensing of 
liquor is repugnant to the provision of section 2242 (<em>g</em>) of the same 
Revised Administrative Code, the Municipal Council of Tacloban had no power 
under said section 2238 to enact the ordinance under consideration. The 
prohibition is contrary to the power granted by Sec. 2242 (<em>g</em>) "to 
regulate the selling, giving away and dispensing of intoxicating malt, vinous, 
mixed or fermented liquors at retail"; because the word "regulate" means and 
includes the power to control, to govern and to restrain; and can not be 
construed as synonymous with "suppress" or "prohibit"; "(Kwong Sing <em>vs.</em> 
City of Manila, 41 Phil., 103). Since the municipality of Tacloban is empowered 
only to regulate, it cannot prohibit the selling, giving away and dispensing of 
intoxicating liquors, for that which is prohibited or does not legally exist can 
not be regulated.</p>
<p>The powers, conferred upon a municipal council in the general welfare clause, 
or section 2238 of the Revised Administrative Code, refers to matters not 
covered by the other provisions of the same Code, and therefore it can not be 
applied to intoxicating liquors, for the power to regulate the selling, giving 
away and dispensing thereof is granted specifically by section 2242 (<em>g</em>) 
to municipal councils. To hold that, under the general power granted by section 
2238, a municipal council may enact the ordinance in question, notwithstanding 
the provision of section 2242 (<em>g</em>), would be to make the latter 
superflous and nugatory, because the power to prohibit, includes power to 
regulate, the selling, giving away and dispensing of intoxicating liquors. </p>
<p>Under the charters of municipal corporations in the States of the Union, from 
which the provisions of the Organic Act of our cities and municipalities were 
taken, municipal corporations are generally granted, not only the specific power 
to regulate the sale or traffic of intoxicating liquors, but also the general 
welfare power similar to that conferred by section 2238 Of the Revised 
Administrative Code. And the Courts of last resort in the said States have 
uniformly held that the "legislative authority to license or regulate the sale 
of intoxicating liquors does not authorize a municipality to prohibit it, either 
in express terms or by imposing prohibitive license fees". (15 R.C.L,, p. 
262). And the general powers granted in the general welfare clause does not 
authorize a municipal council to prohibit the sale of intoxicants, because, as 
stated In American Jurisprudence, vol. 30, p. 367, "as a general rule when a 
municipal corporation is specifically given authority or power to regulate or to 
license and regulate the liquor traffic, power to prohibit is impliedly 
withheld".</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the appealed orders or resolutions of the lower, 
court dismissing the informations in the above entitled cases, are affirmed, 
without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered. </p><em>Parás, Actg. C. J., 
Perfecto, Bengzon,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
