				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This appeal is related to the case of People vs. Federico Geronimo 
<i>alias</i> Cmdr. Oscar, et al., G. R. No. L-8936, decided by this Court on 
October 23, 1956 (100 Phil., 90; 53 Off. Gaz. No. 1, 68).<p></p>
<p>Herein appellant Abundio Romagosa <i>alias</i> David was, in an information 
filed by the Provincial Fiscal, accused in the Court of First Instance of 
Camarines Sur of the complex crime of rebellion with murders, robberies, and 
kidnappings, under three counts that are the last three of the five counts 
charged against Federico Geronimo, et al., in said case No. G. R. L-8936, 
<i>supra</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about May 28, 1946 and for sometime prior and subsequent thereto 
and continuously up to the present time in the province of Camarines Sur, 
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court and in other 
municipalities, cities and provinces and other parts of the country where they 
have chosen to carry out their rebellious activities, the above-named accused 
being then ranking officers and/or members of, or otherwise affiliated with the 
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the Hukbong Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan 
(HMB) or otherwise known as the Hukbalahaps (HUKS) the latter being the armed 
force of said Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) having come to an 
agreement and decide to commit the crime of Rebellion, and therefore, conspiring 
together and confederating among themselves with all of the thirty-one accused 
in criminal case Nos. 14071, 142S2 14315, 14270, 15344 and with all the accused 
in criminal case number 19166 of the Court of First Instance of Manila with the 
other members, officers and/or affiliates of the Communist Party of the 
Philippines and the Hukbong Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan and with many others whose 
identities and whereabouts are still unknown, acting in accordance with their 
conspiracy and in furtherance thereof, and mutually helping one another, did, 
then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, help support, promote, 
maintain, direct and/or command the Hukbalahaps (HUKS) or the Hukbong 
Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan (HMB), to rise publicly and take arms against the 
government of the Republic of the Philippines, or otherwise participate in such 
public armed uprisings for the purpose of removing the territory of the 
Philippines from the allegiance to the government and laws thereof, as in fact 
the said Hukbong Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan (HMB) or the Hukbalahaps (HUKS) pursuant 
to such conspiracy, have risen publicly and taken arms against the Government of 
the Republic of the Philippines to attain said purpose, by then and there making 
armed raids, sorties, and ambuscades, attacks against the Philippine 
Constabulary, the civilian guards, the Police and the Army.Patrols and other 
detachments as well as upon innocent civilians, and as a necessary means to 
commit the crime of Rebellion, in connection therewith and in furtherance 
thereof, have then and there committed wanton acts of murder, pillage, looting, 
plunder, kidnappings and planned destructions of private and public property and 
plotted the liquidation of government officials, to create and spread disorder, 
terror, confusion, chaos and fear so as to facilitate the accomplishment of the 
aforesaid purpose, among which are as follows to wit:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>That on or about the years 1951 to 1952 in the municipality of Paaacao, 
Camarines Sur, Philippines, a group of Armed Huks under Commander Rustum raided 
the house of one Nemesio Palo, a Police sergeant of Libmanan, Camarines Sur and 
as a result, said HUKS were able to capture said Nemesio Palo and once captured, 
with evident premeditation, treachery and intent to kill, stab, shot and cut the 
neck of said Nemesio Palo thereby causing the instantaneous death of Nemesio 
Palo.<br><br>
</li><li>That on or about January 31, 1953, at barrio of Santa Rita, Del Gallego, 
Camarines Sur a group of HMBS with Pederico Geronimo <i>alias</i> Commander 
Oscar ambushed and fired upon an Army Patrol headed by CPL Bayrante, resulting 
in seriously wounding of PFC Pancracio Torrado and Eusebio Gruta, a 
civilian.<br><br>
</li><li>That on or about February 1954 at barrio Cotmo, San Fernando, Camarines Sur, 
Abundio Romagosa, one of a group of four HMBS led by accused Commander Oscar 
with evident premeditation, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously killed one 
Policarpio Tipay, a barrio lieutenant." </li></ol>
<p>As in the case of Federico Geronimo, appellant Romagosa, upon arraignment, 
entered a plea of guilty to the information. In view of the voluntary plea of 
guilty, the prosecution recommended that the penalty of life imprisonment be 
imposed on the accused, on the ground that the charge being a complex crime of 
rebellion with murders, robberies, and kidnappings, the penalty provided for by 
law is the maximum of the most serious crime which is murder. Counsel for the 
accused, on the other hand, argued that the proper penalty imposable upon the 
accused was only <i>prision mayor</i>, since there is no such complex crime as 
rebellion with murders, robberies, and kidnappings, because the latter being the 
natural consequences of the crime of rebellion, the crime charged against the 
accused should be considered only as simple rebellion.</p>
<p>On October 13, 1954, the lower court rendered judgment finding accused 
Romagosa guilty of the complex crime of rebellion with murders, robberies, and 
kidnappings; and giving him the benefit of the mitigating circumstance of 
voluntary plea of guilty, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion 
perpetua</i>; to pay a fine of P10,000; to indemnify the heirs of the two 
persons killed named in the information, in the sum of P6,000.00 each; and to 
pay the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p>From the judgment accused Romagosa appealed to this Court, insisting that 
there is no crime of rebellion with murders, robberies, and kidnappings, and 
that he should have been convicted only of simple rebellion and imposed the 
penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period, in view of his voluntary 
plea of guilty.</p>
<p>The question of whether there is a complex crime of rebellion with murder, 
robbery, and kidnapping under Art. 48 of the Revised Penal Code, is exactly the 
same question raised and decided in the cases of People vs. Hernandez, et al.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1">* </span>52 O.G. No. 11, 5506, and People vs. Geronimo, 
<i>supra</i>. None of the members of this Court has found reason to change his 
respective stand on the matter as expressed in the Geronimo case, wherein the 
majority of this Court held that where the crimes of murders, robberies, and 
kidnappings are committed as a means to or in furtherance of the rebellion 
charged, they are absorbed by, and form part and parcel of, the rebellion, and 
that therefore, the accused can be convicted only of the simple crime of 
rebellion. Consistently with that precedent, we hold that the lower court erred 
in holding appellant Romagosa guilty of the complex crime of rebellion with 
murders, robberies, and kidnappings, and in imposing upon him the penalty for 
such crime.</p>
<p>As in the Geronimo case, there is the further question of whether, in view of 
appellant's plea of guilty to the information, he should be deemed to have 
admitted the commission of the simple crime of rebellion alone, or of rebellion 
and other separate crimes, if any of the counts of the information charges 
crimes independent of and not constituting essential acts or ingredients of the 
rebellion charged. As already stated, the three counts of the information 
against herein appellant Romagosa are exactly the same as the last three of the 
five counts charged against Federico Geronimo (G. R. No. L-8936). As ruled by 
the majority in the preceding case, the first count under the present 
information (the third count against Geronimo) does not charge appellant's 
participation and can not, therefore, be taken into consideration in this case; 
the second (the fourth count against Geronimo) alleges an essential act of 
rebellion and is absorbed by that crime; while the third (the fifth count 
against Geronimo) charges the murder of one Policarpio Tibay, a barrio 
lieutenant, which killing, though committed within the jurisdiction of the lower 
court, does not appear to be related to the rebellion and hence constitutes an 
independent offense in itself.</p>
<p>The same majority of six justices of this Court maintain their view expressed 
in the Geronimo case that by his plea of guilty, appellant has admitted the 
commission of the independent crime of murder alleged in count 3 of the 
information, the averment that said crime was perpetrated “in furtherance" of 
the rebellion being a mere conclusion and not a bar to appellant's conviction 
and punishment for said offense, appellant having failed, at the arraignment, to 
object to the information on the ground of multiplicity of crimes charged. 
Therefore, appellant must be held guilty, and sentenced for the commission, of 
two separate offenses, simple rebellion and murder.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is modified in the sense that appellant 
Abundio Romagosa <i>alias</i> David is convicted of the crimes of simple 
rebellion and murder; and considering the mitigating effect of his plea of 
guilty, appellant is sentenced for the rebellion: to suffer 8 years of 
<i>prision mayor</i> and to pay a fine of P10,000.00 (without subsidiary 
imprisonment pursuant to Art. 38 of the Revised Penal Code), and for the murder: 
to an indeterminate sentence of not less than 10 years and 1 day of <i>prision 
mayor </i>as minimum and not more than 18 years of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as 
maximum; to indemnify the heirs of Policarpio Tibay in the sum of P6,000.00 
solidarily with Federico Geronimo, alias Commander Oscar (G.R. No. L-8936), and 
others adjudged guilty of having participated in the slaying of said deceased; 
and to pay the costs. So Ordered.</p>

<p align="center"><i>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CONCEPCION</b>, J.,</p>
<p>In the information herein, it alleged: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about May 28, 1946, * * * in the province of Camarines Sur, 
Philippines, * * * the above-named accused being then ranking officers and/or 
members * * * of the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Hukbong 
Mapagpalaya Ng Bayan (HMB) having come to an agreement and decide to commit the 
crime of rebellion and * * * conspiring together and confederating among 
themselves with all the * * * accused in criminal cases Nos. l4071, 14232, 
14315, 15344 and * * * 19166 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, * * * 
<i>acting in accordance with their conspirary and in furtherance thereof, </i>* 
* * did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, help support, 
promote, maintain, direct and/or command the Hukbalahaps * * * to rise publicly 
against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, * * * for the purpose 
of removing the territory of the Philippines from the allegiance to the 
government and laws thereof * * * and as a necessary means to commit the crime 
of rebellion, in connection therewith and in furtherance thereof, have then and 
there committed wanton acts of murder * * * and plotted the liquidation of 
government officials, * * * so as to facilitate the accomplishment of the 
aforesaid purpose, among which are as follows:</p>
<p>'3. That on or about February at barrio Cotmo, San Fernando, Camarines Sur, 
Abundio Romagosa, one of a group of four HMBS led by <i>accused Commander 
Oscar</i> with evident premeditation, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
killed one Policarpio Tipay,<i> a barrio lieutenant.</i>'" (Underscoring 
ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the light of the specific allegation in said information to the effect 
that the killing of Policarpio Tipay, a barrio lieutenant, was committed by 
Abundio Romagosa, "in accordance with” his conspiracy with other persons "to 
commit the crime of rebellion" * * * and "<i>as a necessary means to commit the 
crime of rebellion in connection therewith and in furtherance thereof</i> * * * 
so as to facilitate the accomplishment of the aforesaid purpose." I find it 
difficult, not to say impossible, to conclude that said killing is "not related" 
to the charge of rebellion and constitutes in itself an "independent offense." 
Besides, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, in the record before Us, to show 
that this allegation of the information is inaccurate. What is more, inasmuch as 
appellant is being sentenced <i>upon his plea of guilty</i>, we should confine 
ourselves, strictly, to the allegations of said Information, in the 
determination of the crime or crimes committed by him and in the imposition of 
the corresponding penalty.</p>
<p>In fact, had he entered a plea of not guilty, appellant would have been 
entitled to object to any evidence tending to prove that the killing of 
Policarpio Tipay was "independent" of and "not related" to the crime of 
rebellion charged in the information. Indeed, had he moved to quash the 
information upon the ground that it charges more than one offense, it would have 
been proper to deny the motion for the reason that only one offense was meant to 
be, and is actually, alleged In said information. In other words, appellant had 
never been advised that he is being accused of more than one (1) offense, and, 
hence, his conviction for murder of Policarpio Tipay, as if it were a completely 
distinct offense, independent and separate from that of rebellion, would be a 
denial of due process of law, one of the most fundamental rights guaranteed in 
our Constitution.</p>
<p>Although, evidently, the decision in the case at bar merely adheres to the 
view of the majority in People vs. Geronimo (100 Phil., 90; 53 Off. Gaz., 
68)—which was <i>not</i> shared by five (5) members of this Court (Chief Justice 
Paras and Justices Bengzon, Alex. Reyes, Concepcion and Reyes, J.B.L.)—I am 
constrained, to dissent, therefore, insofar appellant is convicted of murder, 
and sentenced accordingly, in addition to simple rebellion. </p>
