				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cavite, Hon. 
Primitive L. Gonzales, presiding, dismissing an action filed by 
plaintiff-appellant seeking to recover the sum of P88,177.63 collected by the 
defendant-appellee as municipal amusement taxes during the years 1948 to 1954, 
inclusive.<p></p>
<p>The taxes sought to be refunded were collected under and by virtue of 
Ordinance No. 29, sections 227 to 230 of the City of Cavite, approved on 
December 12, 1946, consisting of the following P0.05 for every balcony admission 
ticket sold and P0.03 for every general admission ticket. The City of Cavite had 
also been collecting under its ordinance a license tax of P800.00 per annum or 
P70.00 per month from proprietors of theatres under Sections 221 to 222 of the 
city ordinance and amusement taxes of from P0.02 to P0.10, according to the 
value of the tickets sold under Section 260 of the National Internal Revenue 
Code, although these two forms of taxes are not subject to question. It is 
alleged in the complaint that the taxes in question were paid under protest 
verbally and/or in writing; that the collection of said taxes are not expressly 
authorized in the Charter of said City; and that the provisions of the ordinance 
under which the same are collected are unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The defendant in its answer expressly denied that the taxes were paid "under 
protest verbally and/or in writing," and alleged that it was only in the year 
1954 that the payment of the taxes for the months of September and October, 1954 
was made under protest; that the amounts collected under the ordinance as taxes 
on the tickets come from cinemagoers, the plaintiff merely acting as agent for 
the collection of the same. In answer to the claim that the taxes are not 
expressly authorized and that the ordinance is unconstitutional, the defendant 
alleges that the collection of the same is authorized by the City Charter and 
that the collection thereof is in no sense objectionable.</p>
<p>Under the above issues the parties went to trial, and thereafter the court 
rendered decision dismissing the action. The court, however, did not pass upon 
all the issues of fact raised in the pleadings, but only on the legal issue as 
to whether or not the ordinance under which the taxes were collected was within 
the power of the municipal council of Cavite to enact, the court holding that 
the enactment of said ordinance was authorized under the City Charter which 
grants the said City the legislative power to (a) provide for the levy and 
collection of taxes for general and special purposes, and (b) regulate and fix 
the amount of license fees for the operation of theatres and cinematographs and 
other places of amusement</p>
<p>On this appeal reliance is placed by plaintiff-appellant on the decision we 
have rendered in the case of Icard vs. The City of Baguio, G. R. No. L-1281, 
promulgated May 31, 1949. It is argued by the plaintiff-appellant that the 
decision was promulgated under provisions of the charter of the City of Baguio 
similar to those of the Cavite City Charter, as follows:</p>

<p>The defendants-appellees do not question the applicability of the decision 
cited to the case at bar. We find that the provisions of the Charter of the City 
of Cavite under which the additional amusement tax of P0.03 and P0.05 per ticket 
was collected, are similar to those of the Charter of the City of Baguio under 
which the taxes sought to be recovered in Icard vs. The City of Baguio, supra, 
were collected. Section 15(a) of the City Charter of Cavite does not authorize 
the imposition of the P0.03 and P0.05 additional tax; it only authorizes the 
levy and collection of taxes "in accordance with law;" so for the authority to 
impose the additional tax of P0.05 and P0.03 recourse must be had to the other 
provisions of the Charter. There is no such provision which grants the 
authority. Paragraph (n), Section 15, of the Charter (of Cavite City) which 
authorizes the City to regulate and fix the amount of license fees for the 
operators of cinematographs and other places of amusement,is merely regulatory 
fixing the amount of license fees for theatres. This is authority for Sections 
221 to 222 of the ordinance of the City of Cavite, which impose a license fee of 
P800.00 per annum on proprietors of theatres. But an authority to collect the 
additional P0.03 and P0.05 tax on tickets cannot be inferred or implied from 
this provision. The P0.03 and P0.05 tax on admission tickets is a tax and not a 
license fee, a tax being an assessment against property or business, whereas a 
license fee is collected for the purpose of regulation. (Cooley on Taxation, 
Vol. 1, 4th ed., p. 110; Calalang vs. Lorenzo, et al., G.R. No. L-6961, June 
17, 1955, 51 O.G. [6] 2859.) We, therefore, find that the claim of the 
plaintiff-appellant that the collection of the tax of P0.03 and P0.05 per 
admission ticket imposed by the ordinance of the City of Cavite is beyond the 
power granted to the said City in its Charter and the collection of said tax is, 
therefore, illegal and void.</p>
<p>As we have heretofore indicated, defendant-appellee does not dispute the 
claim of plaintiff-appellant that the ordinance imposing the tax of P0.03 and 
P0.05 per admission ticket is beyond the power granted the City of Cavite. But 
reliance is placed on the claim that the paymer of the said tax has been 
voluntary until the collection of taxes for September and October, 1954. It is, 
however, unnecessary to consider this defense because the other defense is 
determinative of the action.</p>
<p>With respect to the defense raised to the effect that the taxes collected 
came from cinemagoers and not from the plaintiff, counsel for 
plaintiff-appellant argues that the taxes came from the plaintiff and not from 
the public patronizing the theatres, because the ordinance requires that the 
said taxes should be paid by the "proprietor, lessee or operator of theatre," It 
is also argued that when the taxes were imposed the prices for admission were 
reduced. While it is true that the plaintiff-appellant is the one that paid the 
taxes the evidence submitted at the trial shows that said taxes were charged by 
the plaintiff-appellant against the cinemagoers. This is borne out by the 
admission tickets that the plaintiff-appellant issued to theatre goers, 
thus:</p>
<p align="center">"REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES<br>CAVITE CITY OFFICE OF THE 
TREASURER</p>
<p align="right">December 8, 1955</p>
<p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</p>
<p>This is to certify that the following are the true copies of the balcony and 
general ad mission tickets sold to cinemagoers of Perla theatre.</p>
<p align="center">PERLA THEATRE<br>Cavite City<br>P0.80 Balcony P0.80<br>Inc. Tax 
Admit One Inc. Tax<br>Good for Today only<br>262001 262001</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="right">G. BUSTAMANTE <br>City Treasurer<br></p>
<p align="right">By:<br>RICARDO IÃ‘OLA <br>Chief Collection 
Division"</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be true, as the evidence for the plaintiff seems to indicate, that 
when the taxes were collected the prices for admission were reduced. The 
reduction, however was not made in order that the cinemagoers be relieved from 
the obligation of paying the tax. Notwithstanding the reduction in the price for 
admission, the plaintiff-appellant continued collecting the tax from the 
cinema-goers as proved by the tickets that plaintiff-appellant himself issued. 
The reduction was made in the admission tickets for election purposes, to 
impress upon the public that the plaintiff-appellant was waiving a portion of 
the price of the tickets for the public benefit. The claim of the 
plaintiff-appellant that the taxes were paid with plaintiff-appellant's own 
money is, therefore, not supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>It is also argued on behalf of the plaintiff-appellant that even if the taxes 
collected belong to the cinemagoers the city is merely a trustee thereof. 
Admitting for the sake of argument that because of the illegality of the tax the 
City has become a mere trustee, it does not necessarily follow that 
plaintiff-appellant by the mere circumstance that it collected said taxes for 
and on behalf of the City, thereby acquires the right to recover the same from 
the City. Plaintiff-appellant is not the owner of the taxes collected by the 
City, so he has no right to bring an action for the refund thereof. Without 
pursuing the argument further on this issue, suffice it for Us to state that in 
a similar case, We have decided that the person who collects the tax, which is 
illegal, and pays it to a city, has no right to bring an action to recover said 
tax from the city for said right belongs to the taxpayers themselves. To such 
effect was our holding in the case of Medina, et al. vs. City of Baguio, G. R. 
No. L-4060, Aug. 29, 1952, 48 0, G. (3) 4769:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is evident that the amusement tax was paid by the public thru the manager 
of the plaintiff acting as agent of the government, therefore the amusement tax 
paid to the government is not the property of the plaintiff, and if anybody has 
the right to claim it is the public who paid it and not the plaintiff. If 
anybody has a right to claim it, it is those who paid it. Only owner of the 
property has the right to claim said property."</p></blockquote>
<p>Resuming what We have stated above, We hereby find that while the taxes 
sought to be recovered have been collected under an invalid ordinance, for the 
reason that the City of Cavite had no authority to enact the same, 
plaintiff-appellant is without right to recover the taxes from the City, as such 
right belongs to the cinema-goers or public that had paid the same.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, although on other 
grounds. Costs against the plaintiff-appellant. So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,
