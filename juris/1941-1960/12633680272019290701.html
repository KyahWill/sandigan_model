				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal by&nbsp; certiorari from a decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; declaring the&nbsp; tax&nbsp; title&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendants-appellees to the property&nbsp; subject of the action null and void, and ordering&nbsp; them&nbsp; to pay plaintiffs-appellants&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; sum&nbsp;&nbsp; of P300.00 as attorney's fees;<br><br>The facts&nbsp; material&nbsp; to the case, as&nbsp; found by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals,&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"From the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs, it appears that the two parcels of land&nbsp; involved herein were registered under the Land Registration Act,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; names of&nbsp; the brothers Miguel&nbsp; Pantaleon and Florentina Pantaleon, as co-owners, up to the institution&nbsp; of this action.&nbsp; Florentina Pantaleon&nbsp; was the&nbsp; deceased parent of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; In 1918,&nbsp; Miguel Pantaleon executed in favor&nbsp; of the spouses Francisco Manang Cruz&nbsp; and&nbsp; Bruna Fantalcon a deed of sale of the "derecho, titulo y participacion que el&nbsp; condueno inscrito&nbsp; Miguel Pantaleon tiene sobre el terreno descmto&nbsp; en este certificado&nbsp; de titulo"&nbsp; (referring to&nbsp; O. C. T. Nos. 1380 and 1484).&nbsp; The other halves of the&nbsp; properties covered by these titles which&nbsp; pertained to Florentina Pantaleon&nbsp; and not disposed of by Miguel, were in&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of the plaintiff up to&nbsp; the filing of this action. It appears that those halves&nbsp; were formerly in the possession of defendants Eruna Pantaleon, Demetria M.&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; and Leonida M.&nbsp; Cruz, but&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1945,&nbsp; the plaintiffs were&nbsp; restored to the possession thereof upon demand from said Bruna, Demetria and Leonida,&nbsp; in consideration of the&nbsp; renun- ciation by the plaintiffs of their right to recover from them (defendants)&nbsp; the&nbsp; value of the produce of the&nbsp; undisposed portions and&nbsp; of the obligation undertaken by said defendants to pay all real property taxes&nbsp; thereon.&nbsp; This&nbsp; undertaking,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; was not complied with by the defendants and, in 1951, the two parcels of land, covered by O. C. T. Nos. 1380 and 1484, were sold in their entirety by the defendant&nbsp; Provincial Treasurer&nbsp; of Rizal, for alleged non-payment of P57.57, the taxes due thereon,&nbsp; and&nbsp; were bought by&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; Teodulo&nbsp; Carignra and Demetria&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; for P540, they being the highest bidders at the public auction sale.&nbsp; One year thereafter, the veiidecs were given the final deeds of sale&nbsp; (Exhibit 8) 'which were annotated on the dorsum of the certificates of title. Plaintiffs allege that all these proceedings were not&nbsp; known to them and when later on&nbsp; they learned about them, they hurriedly engaged a lawyer to bring&nbsp; this action."</blockquote>In the complaint&nbsp; plaintiffs allege&nbsp; that their undivided share in&nbsp; the two&nbsp; lots subject of the action&nbsp; was sold for non-payment of land&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; thereon through&nbsp; connivance between the defendants; that their share in&nbsp; the property was sold at public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; without&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; public notice and&nbsp; without notice to them of any tax delinquency thereon, notwithstanding the fact that they were in actual physical&nbsp; occupation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale.&nbsp; They, therefore, pray&nbsp; that the sale of&nbsp; their share&nbsp; in the lands in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendants be&nbsp; declared null and void and that they be paid damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; In their answer the defendants deny&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; most&nbsp; of&nbsp; the material&nbsp; allegations of the&nbsp; complaint and&nbsp; allege&nbsp; that the lands&nbsp; were sold at public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; after due notice of the delinquency,&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the required procedure established by law that plaintiffs do&nbsp; not have&nbsp; any right to the&nbsp; property as they have never claimed such right for the last 34 years and since 1918&nbsp; when&nbsp; the properties were sold&nbsp; to&nbsp; Francisco Manang Cruz and&nbsp; Bruna&nbsp; Pantaleon.&nbsp; As the provincial treasurer of&nbsp; Rizal&nbsp; and the municipal&nbsp; treasurer&nbsp; of Teresa, Rizal were included as defendants, they also presented their answer&nbsp; denying the&nbsp; alleged failure to comply with&nbsp; the procedure established&nbsp; by law&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; of delinquent properties.&nbsp; As special defenses they allege that the tax lien attached to&nbsp; the realty to whomsoever the land is sold&nbsp; or transferred,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; tax liability fall&nbsp; on them.<br><br>The Court of First Instance of Rizal,&nbsp; after trial, dismissed the action,&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; as the plaintiffs&nbsp; had not paid the taxes&nbsp; due, in spite of the fact that they were in possession of the property as co-owners&nbsp; since 1945, the remedy prayed for could not be&nbsp; granted them because they had slept&nbsp; on their rights.&nbsp; Against this&nbsp; decision, the case was appealed to the Court of Appeals, which&nbsp; reversed the judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; and rendered&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision already pointed out above.<br><br>In&nbsp; this Court, petitioners make seven&nbsp; assignments of error.&nbsp; It is not, however, necessary to&nbsp; consider&nbsp; all of them as&nbsp; the&nbsp; main&nbsp; contention in all&nbsp; is that the&nbsp; respondents are guilty of&nbsp; estoppel by laches because&nbsp; they have failed to declare the property in their names&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; period of 35&nbsp; years; that&nbsp; in spite of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; they have been in possession&nbsp; since&nbsp; 1941&nbsp; up to 1952 they have not paid a centavo of&nbsp; the taxes due thereon.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; furthermore claimed that&nbsp; no&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of the delinquency of the tax of the property was&nbsp; made because the property was declared in the name of Francisco M.&nbsp; Cruz and not in their name,&nbsp; it being impossible that a person&nbsp; is not&nbsp; the declared owner of the&nbsp; property be notified of the delinquency.<br><br>There is no&nbsp; question that the&nbsp; whole land was&nbsp; assessed in the name&nbsp; of Francisco M.&nbsp; Cruz from&nbsp; the&nbsp; time he bought the one-half share of&nbsp; Miguel Pantaleon;&nbsp; that the delinquency for taxes&nbsp; was&nbsp; on&nbsp; the two parcels&nbsp; of land in question;&nbsp; designated as lots Nos.&nbsp; 3577&nbsp; and&nbsp; 3579&nbsp; of the cadastral&nbsp; survey of Antipolo,&nbsp; Rizal;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the delinquency was&nbsp; for&nbsp; seven&nbsp; years, from 1944 to&nbsp; 1951; that the heirs of the registered owner&nbsp; of one-half undivided share in the properties,&nbsp; Florentina. Pantaleon, are&nbsp; not included as declared owners of&nbsp; the property,&nbsp; the declared&nbsp; owner being Francisco M. Cruz alone;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Francisco M.&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; was the only one notified of&nbsp; the proceedings&nbsp; for the sale of the property&nbsp; on the ground of delinquency in the payment of real estate&nbsp; taxes, and the heirs of Florentina Pan- taleon were not notified;&nbsp; and that the petitioners Bruna Pantaleon,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; were&nbsp; the purchasers of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; lots at&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale at&nbsp; public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; officials of&nbsp; the municipality.<br><br>With the above facts&nbsp; in mind,&nbsp; the Question&nbsp; presented to&nbsp; us&nbsp; for determination&nbsp; is whether or&nbsp; not the&nbsp; plaintiffs, respondents herein,&nbsp; lost&nbsp; their&nbsp; title&nbsp; and interest&nbsp; in said undivided share because&nbsp; of the administrative proceedings for the sale&nbsp; of said&nbsp; lands&nbsp; in their entirety&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners-appellants herein.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals resolved this&nbsp; question&nbsp; in part in the following&nbsp; manner:<br><blockquote>"Appellants argue that in&nbsp; the supposition that&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; at public auction was regular, still the&nbsp; defendants-vendees did not&nbsp; acquire any right at said sale.&nbsp; The argument is not without merits.&nbsp; The right of Francisco M. Cruz over the&nbsp; land described&nbsp; in O. C. T. Nos. 1380&nbsp; and 1484 was limited&nbsp; to&nbsp; the rights,&nbsp; title&nbsp; and participation of the registered co-owner Miguel Pantaleon.&nbsp; Only one-half of said prop- erties corresponded to said Miguel Pantaleon.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; public auc- tion, however, both parcels of land were sold&nbsp; in&nbsp; their entirety, although&nbsp; the certificates of gale stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; vendee acquired only the rights&nbsp; and interests&nbsp; of Francisco M. Cruz. In other words, if Francisco M. Cruz became delinquent in the payment of real property taxes&nbsp; on his portion acquired from Miguel Pantaleon,&nbsp; then only his right can be sold to satisfy the delinquency.&nbsp; The interest of the appellants over&nbsp; the&nbsp; other half not disposed&nbsp; of in the&nbsp; deed in favor of Francisco M. Cruz cannot be prejudiced or adversely affected&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; act of&nbsp; said Cms&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; Rules 123,&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court), and the title in a tax sale being a mere derivative one,&nbsp; the pur- chasers acquire&nbsp; only the apparent interest, whatever it is, of the fax delinquent&nbsp; (Gov't&nbsp; of the&nbsp; P.&nbsp; I. vs. Adriano, 41 Phil., 112).&nbsp; Defendants-vendees claim good&nbsp; faith and alleged&nbsp; that they bought an apparently good title without notice&nbsp; of anything calculated to impair it.&nbsp; It has been held, however, 'that a purchaser of delinquent property at a tax sale, is subject to the rule of caveat&nbsp; emptor&nbsp; and shall suffer all defect of prior title *&nbsp; * *.&nbsp; There is no warranty by the State of the title to a&nbsp; land sold at&nbsp; a tax&nbsp; sale&nbsp; (Ramirez vs. Ilagan,&nbsp; supra).&nbsp; In the instant case,&nbsp; the annotation&nbsp; on&nbsp; the reverse Side of the O. C.&nbsp; T. Nos. 1380 and&nbsp; 1484 revealed that the rights of Francisco M. Crux over the&nbsp; properties in&nbsp; question were not at all&nbsp; absolute in character.&nbsp; Therefore, the sale&nbsp; conducted by the defendant Provincial Treasurer did not convey the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; title to the&nbsp; defendants-vendees, because the alleged&nbsp; delinquent owners&nbsp; did&nbsp; not own all the properties sold at public&nbsp; auction.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purchaser could not claim&nbsp; any better title than its predecessors&nbsp; (Government&nbsp; vs. Adriano, <i>supra</i>)."</blockquote>It&nbsp; is to be&nbsp; noted that&nbsp; Florentina Pantaleon, mother of the plaintiffs, is the registered owner of an&nbsp; undivided one-half&nbsp; share&nbsp; of the parcels of land&nbsp; in question and plaintiffs succeeded her as&nbsp; owners thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; M. Cruz, under&nbsp; whose name both parcels of&nbsp; land were de- clared in their entirety, had acquired only the&nbsp; undivided one-half share&nbsp; of Miguel Pantaleon, and this limited nature&nbsp; of his&nbsp; right appears at the&nbsp; back of the certificates of title&nbsp; covering&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; lands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Francisco M. Cruz is not,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; the owner of the other undivided one-half share, originally belonging to&nbsp; Florentina Pantaleon.<br><br>The question&nbsp; directly presented&nbsp; by the facts,&nbsp; therefore, is:&nbsp; Are&nbsp; the rights of a&nbsp; registered but undeclared owner of one-half of the property,&nbsp; affected by the&nbsp; administrative or tax delinquency proceeding against the&nbsp; registered owner of the&nbsp; other half of&nbsp; the property, who is&nbsp; the declared owner of the whole?&nbsp;&nbsp; The provisions of the&nbsp; Provincial Assessment Law in force at the time of the promulgation of the decision&nbsp; in Government of the P. I. vs. Adriano,&nbsp; 41 Phil.&nbsp; 112&nbsp; (1920) are still in force.&nbsp; These&nbsp; provisions are now Sections 28 to 41 of Commonwealth Act No. 470 (June 16, 1939).&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the P. I. vs. Adriano,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>, we held that the&nbsp; above&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of the law for the sale of the land for non-payment of taxes establish a proceeding in <i>personam</i>, as the tax is not a charge on the land&nbsp; alone,&nbsp; and only the particular interest of the person to whom the land&nbsp; is&nbsp; assessed is sold.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it was&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"The exact phraseology of&nbsp; the particular&nbsp; statute would seem to determine the&nbsp; doctrine applicable in&nbsp; each jurisdiction.&nbsp; The Philippine law on the subject of taxation, when this tax sale occurred, was found&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Municipal Code, Act&nbsp; No. 82&nbsp; (sections&nbsp; 74-83), as amended by Act No. 1130.&nbsp; According&nbsp; to these&nbsp; provisions, in case of default&nbsp; in the&nbsp; payment of land taxes, the personal&nbsp; property of the delinquent was first seized.&nbsp; Taxes and penalties were thereafter enforceable against the realty arid, if necessary, it could be sold to satisfy the public taxes assessed against&nbsp; it.&nbsp; In case the taxpayer did not redeem the land sold within one year from the date of the sale, the provincial treasurer, as grantor, executed&nbsp; a deed conveying the land to the purchaser free from all liens of any kind&nbsp; whatsoever.<br><br>"It&nbsp; is thus seen that there was&nbsp; no provision in&nbsp; the&nbsp; local&nbsp; law, such as is found in Iowa and other&nbsp; states, vesting&nbsp; in the purchaser 'all the title of the former owner as well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the State and County.' (See Hefner vs. Northwestern Mut. L. Ins. Co. .[1887], 123 U.S., 747.)&nbsp; It is further seen that proceedings in the Philippines for the sale of land for the nonpayment of&nbsp; taxes were <i>in&nbsp; personam</i>.&nbsp; (Valencia vs. Jimenez and Fuster [1908],&nbsp; 11 Phil.,&nbsp; 492).&nbsp; The tax was not a charge upon the land&nbsp; alone.&nbsp; The&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; were first re- quired to hunt up the owner and to make the&nbsp; tax out of his&nbsp; personal property.&nbsp; Only the&nbsp; particular interest or title of the&nbsp; person. to whom&nbsp; the land is assessed was sold.&nbsp; As a&nbsp; stream cannot&nbsp; rise higher&nbsp; than its&nbsp; source, so&nbsp; the&nbsp; purchaser&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; claim&nbsp; any better title than&nbsp; his predecessors."&nbsp; (Government&nbsp; of the P. I. vs, Adriano,&nbsp; 41 Phil. 118-119).</blockquote>That&nbsp; the proceedings&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of delinquent real estate under the&nbsp; Provincial Assessment&nbsp; Law are&nbsp; <i>in personam</i>&nbsp; can be inferred&nbsp; from a comparison thereof with the corresponding provisions of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Charter&nbsp; of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 409.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 56 imposes a duty upon&nbsp; any person acquiring&nbsp; real estate or constructing thereon to prepare a declaration thereof, for purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; assessment,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the assessment then&nbsp; made is made&nbsp; "valid&nbsp; and binding on all. persons&nbsp; interested." Section&nbsp; 57 provides that if&nbsp; an&nbsp; owner&nbsp; fails&nbsp; to make&nbsp; a return&nbsp; or declaration&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; assessor&nbsp; is&nbsp; unable to&nbsp; discover the owner, the latter shall nevertheless list the same for taxation, and charge the tax against the true owner, if known, and if unknown&nbsp; against an unknown owner.&nbsp; Sec- tion 58&nbsp; requires the assessor&nbsp; to list and value&nbsp; property not&nbsp; already listed and&nbsp; charge&nbsp; against the&nbsp; owner thereof the&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; due&nbsp; and past&nbsp; due.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 68&nbsp; provides that taxes and penalties assessed against realty shall&nbsp; constitute a lien&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; superior to all&nbsp; others,&nbsp; thus: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 68. <i>Tax&nbsp; lien.</i>—Taxes and penalties assessed&nbsp; agains realty shall constitute a&nbsp; lien&nbsp; thereon, which shall be superior to all other liens, mortgages, or incumbrances of any kind whatsoever; shall bo enforceable against the property whether in the possession&nbsp; of the delinquent or any of the tax and penalty.&nbsp; A lien upon real estate for taxes levied for each year shall attach on the first day of January of such year."&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 409.) Section 69&nbsp; provides that advertisements for&nbsp; the sale of real estate&nbsp; shall be published&nbsp; in a newspaper of general circulation&nbsp; in&nbsp; the city.&nbsp; It&nbsp; also provides&nbsp; that it&nbsp; is&nbsp; not essential for&nbsp; the validity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; at&nbsp; public auction that distraint&nbsp; of&nbsp; personal&nbsp; property of the&nbsp; delinquent be proceeded&nbsp; with, the&nbsp; distraint&nbsp;&nbsp; being&nbsp; merely&nbsp; cumulative. Section 71&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that the tax deed to be&nbsp; issued upon the sale conveys&nbsp; to&nbsp; the purchaser so much as has been sold,&nbsp; "free&nbsp; from all liens of any kind whatsoever."</blockquote>The above indicated provisions of&nbsp; the Revised Charter of the City of Manila&nbsp; are&nbsp; not found&nbsp; or&nbsp; included&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Provincial&nbsp; Assessment&nbsp; Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had it&nbsp; been the intention of the law&nbsp; to make the proceedings for the sale of&nbsp; delinquent real&nbsp; estate&nbsp; in&nbsp; the provinces <i>in&nbsp; rem</i>,&nbsp; as in the City of Manila,&nbsp; the above provisions, which indicate that&nbsp; the proceedings bind the real estate and all the persons having an interest therein,&nbsp; whether notified&nbsp; or not&nbsp; of the proceedings,&nbsp; would&nbsp; have&nbsp; been inserted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Provincial Assessment Law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the provisions as they are,&nbsp; the proceedings for the sale of&nbsp; real estate for&nbsp; delinquency in the provinces must be held to&nbsp; be <i>in personam</i>.<br><br>As the&nbsp; proceedings in the case at bar are not proceedings in rem. but merely <i>in personam</i>, it follows as a necessary consequence&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; rights&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; registered&nbsp; but undeclared&nbsp; owners were not affected&nbsp; by the&nbsp; proceedings in the sale for delinquency.<br><br>We&nbsp; find&nbsp; no&nbsp; merit&nbsp; in the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendants-petitioners&nbsp; that plaintiffs-respondents&nbsp; are guilty of estoppel by&nbsp; laches.&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; bought the property only in the year&nbsp; 1951, and the action&nbsp; of respondents was&nbsp; instituted in 1953,&nbsp; within a period&nbsp; of one&nbsp; year from the sale. Besides, the rule of <i>caveat emptor</i> applies to the purchaser at the&nbsp; sale.&nbsp; The purchasers&nbsp; should&nbsp;&nbsp; have gone to&nbsp; the<br><br>registry of the property to find out the real nature of the right&nbsp; of the&nbsp; declared&nbsp; owner,&nbsp; which&nbsp; right was the one being&nbsp; sold at auction, and had they done&nbsp; so they would have discovered that his right was only an undivided one-half share of the properties.<br><br>Having arrived at&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; conclusions, it becomes unnecessary to consider the other points&nbsp; raised and&nbsp; upon which the decision of the Court of Appeals are also based. The decision appealed from is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners.<br><br><i>Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion, Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ</i>., concur. <br><i>Paras, C.
