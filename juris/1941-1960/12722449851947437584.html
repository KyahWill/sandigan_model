				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FIDEL FORTUNO, DEFENDANT-APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendant Fidel Fortuno rented from "El Hogar Filipino" a room in the Crystal Arcade; and the rental having become due, he issued in favor of the latter a check for P60 drawn against the Bank of the Commonwealth.&nbsp; This check was, upon presentation to the bank for payment, dishonored for lack of funds.&nbsp; An information for <i>estafa</i> was presented against&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; court of Manila where,&nbsp; upon a plea of guilty, he was&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; two months and one day of <i>arresto mayor</i> and to pay an indemnity&nbsp; of P60 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.&nbsp; Defendant appealed to&nbsp; the Court of First Instance where, after entering a plea of not guilty and thereafter substituting the same with the plea&nbsp; of guilty, he was&nbsp; sentenced to the same penalty imposed by the municipal court.&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; interposed the present appeal from this mcfement<br><br>The issuance of a check with knowledge on the part of the drawer that he has no funds to cover its amount and without&nbsp; informing the payee&nbsp; of&nbsp; such circumstance, does&nbsp; not constitute the crime of <i>estafa</i> if the&nbsp; check was intended as payment of a pre-existing obligation, as in the instant case. The reason for this rule is that deceit, to constitute <i>estafa</i>, should be the efficient cause of the defraudation and as such should either be prior to, or simultaneous with, the act of fraud.&nbsp; (Cf. People <i>vs</i>. Lilius, 59 Phil., 339,&nbsp; 342; People<i> vs</i>. Quesada, 60 Phil., 515 520.)<br><br>Defendant's plea of guilty&nbsp; is of no moment.&nbsp; Such plea constitutes&nbsp; a mere admission&nbsp; of the material allegations of the information but not that the facts thus alleged constitute an offense.<br><br>Judgment is reversed and the defendant is hereby acquitted with costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abad Santos, Diaz,&nbsp; Horrilleno</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ozaeta, JJ</span>., concur.</div>
