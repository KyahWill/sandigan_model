				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Philippine National Bank has appealed from the decision of the 
court of first instance of Negros Occidental restraining it and the 
Sheriff from carrying out the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of Lot No. 
939 of the cadastral survey of Ilog, same province.
  <p>    In 1937, Francisco Gemora and his wife Saturnina Portugalete 
executed a deed of mortgage of said lot to the Bank, authorizing the 
latter, in case of breach, to foreclose extrajudicially in accordance 
with Act No. 3135.</p>
  <p>    In November 1957 the Bank requested the Provincial Sheriff to 
take — and the latter took — steps for extrajudicial foreclosure by 
giving appropriate notices; whereupon Saturnina and the heirs of her 
deceased husband presented a special civil action for prohibition 
against the Sheriff and the Bank to block the foreclosure. They asserted
 prescription, the debt having become payable in 1938.</p>
  <p>    Replying to the petition, the Bank alleged that the mortgage 
fell due in April, 1942; that on April 15, 1955 it had sent a demand 
letter to Francisco Gemora; that such letter had stopped the running of 
the prescriptive period; that discounting the years during which the 
Moratorium Law had been in force, less than ten years had elapsed; and 
that, consequently its right to collect the mortgage debt still 
subsisted.</p>
  <p>    The parties submitted the controversy upon a stipulation of 
facts. In his decision of September 30, 1958, Hon. Jose S. de la Cruz, 
Judge, found the debt to have prescribed; and therefore, he permanently 
restrained the foreclosure proceedings.</p>
  <p>    Copy of such decision was forwarded to the Bank's attorneys by 
registered mail. According to the Registry Return Receipt at p. 92 of 
the record, they received it on September 15, 1958.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Without moving for reconsideration, they 
filed the Bank's notice of appeal on October 9, 1958.</p>
  <p>    The appeal was, therefore, taken on the 24th day after receipt 
of the decision. It was late: the notice should have been docketed on or
 before the fifteenth day, as prescribed by sec. 17, Rule 41, this being
 a prohibition case.</p>
  <p>    Under Rule 52, sec. 1, in connection with Rule 58, sec. 1, this
 appeal is hereby dismissed with costs against appellant. So ordered.</p>
   <em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion, Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ</em>., concur.  <br>
    <em>Endencia, J.</em>, took no part. <br>
