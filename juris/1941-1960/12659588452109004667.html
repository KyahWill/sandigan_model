				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Surigao,&nbsp; appellant Moises Cubelo was charged with the crime of&nbsp; illegal fishing with explosives, allegedly&nbsp; committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 7th day of May, 1955, within the jurisdictional waters of the municipality and province of Surigao, Philippines, and within&nbsp; the jurisdiction of this Honorable&nbsp; Court, the said&nbsp; accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously explode one stick of&nbsp; dynamite without permit to do so as a result of which a certain&nbsp; kind of fish locally called <span style="font-style: italic;">tamban </span>valued&nbsp; at P10.00 was&nbsp; disabled, killed&nbsp; and/or stupefied in violation&nbsp; of Act 4003, as amended&nbsp; by Commonwealth Act No. 471 and further amended by Republic Act No. 462."<br></blockquote>He was arraigned on March 25,1957, the information being read and&nbsp; translated to him in the local dialect.&nbsp; To the charged,&nbsp; he&nbsp; pleaded&nbsp; guilty,&nbsp; whereupon, the. trial&nbsp; court declared him guilty of illegal&nbsp; fishing with the&nbsp; use of explosives as defined in Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 4003, as amended, and considering his plea of guilty as a mitigating circumstance, sentenced&nbsp; him—<br><blockquote>"**&nbsp; *&nbsp; to undergo&nbsp; the indeterminate penalty of one (1) year and six&nbsp; (6) <i>months</i>, as minimum, to<i> two&nbsp; (2) years,</i> as maximum, and to pay&nbsp; a fine in the amount of P1,500, or to serve subsidiary imprisonment which shall not be more than one-third&nbsp; (1/3) of the principal&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; or in any case to not more than one year; and to pay the costs."<br></blockquote>However, in spite of his spontaneous plea of guilty, Cubelo appealed the&nbsp; decision to the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; which certified the case to us on&nbsp; the,&nbsp; ground that it involved only questions of law. <br><br>Appellant contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; may&nbsp; not be&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; of illegal&nbsp; fishing with&nbsp; dynamite because&nbsp; the&nbsp; information fails to allege the intention&nbsp; to fish with explosives.<br><br>Act No. 4003, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 471 and further amended by Republic Act No. 462, under which appellant was accused and convicted, reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Rep.&nbsp; Act 462, par.&nbsp; 2—Any person&nbsp; who shall use explosives m fishing in violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the provisions of section twelve&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Act shall be punished by&nbsp; a fine&nbsp; of&nbsp; not&nbsp; less than one&nbsp; thousand&nbsp; five hundred&nbsp; pesos nor more than five thousand, and&nbsp; by imprisonment for not less than one year and six months nor more than five years, aside from the confiscation and forfeiture&nbsp; of&nbsp; all&nbsp; explosives, boats, tackle, apparel, furniture, and other apparatus used in fishing in violation of said section&nbsp; twelve of this Act." (Approved June 9, 1950)</blockquote><br>Defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of&nbsp; his contention, relies&nbsp; upon the phrase&nbsp; "use explosives in&nbsp; fishing", claiming that in order to hold&nbsp; him criminally liable, the information should make it&nbsp; clear that&nbsp; the explosives or&nbsp; dynamite was used&nbsp; in fishing&nbsp; and not for any other purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Republic Act No. 462 is but an&nbsp; amendment of Section 76&nbsp; of Act&nbsp; No. 4003, providing the&nbsp; penalty for violation of Section 12 of said Act.&nbsp; The said Section 12 reads thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote>"Section 12, Act 4003—The&nbsp; use of dynamite or other explosives for the stupefying, disabling, killing or taking of fish or other aquatic animals,&nbsp; or under water for any purpose except&nbsp; in the execution of bona fide engineering work&nbsp; and the destruction of wrecks or&nbsp; obstacles to navigation, or the gathering&nbsp; by any&nbsp; means of the fishes or other&nbsp; aquatic&nbsp; animals stupefied, disabled&nbsp; or&nbsp; killed by the action of dynamite or other explosives shall be&nbsp; unlawful, provided, that the use of mechanical bombs&nbsp; for killing whales, crocodiles/sharks, or other large dangerous fishes, may be allowed, subject to the approval of the Sec.&nbsp; of Agriculture&nbsp; and Natural Resources and the Sec.&nbsp; of Interior, and provided further, that the Sec. of Agriculture and Natural&nbsp; Resources with the&nbsp; concurrence of&nbsp; Sec.&nbsp; of&nbsp; Interior,&nbsp; may issue permits for the use of explosive in taking fish or other aquatic animals in limited numbers for scientific purposes only.&nbsp; Permittees must be ready at all times to exhibit permits on demand by any peace officer or deputy authorized in Sec. 5 hereof to enforce the provisions of this Act."<br></blockquote>The act charged in the information against Cubelo that he willfully, unlawfully and feloniously&nbsp; exploded one stick of dynamite,&nbsp; which explosion&nbsp; resulted in disabling, stupefying&nbsp; and&nbsp; killing a&nbsp; certain kind of&nbsp; fish, known&nbsp; as <span style="font-style: italic;">tamban </span>valued&nbsp; at ten pesos, comes under the&nbsp; provisions of Section 12 and&nbsp; par. 2 of Republic Act 462, above-quoted. Of course, the Fiscal filing the complaint, to&nbsp; dissipate&nbsp; all doubt, should or could have inserted the phrase "for the purpose of fishing", thereby&nbsp; avoiding any need of interpretation,&nbsp; including the reading&nbsp; of the information, in connection with Section 12 of Act 4003.&nbsp; But that Cubelo exploded the&nbsp; dynamite&nbsp; in order to&nbsp; fish, there&nbsp; can be&nbsp; no doubt.&nbsp; To assume that he exploded the&nbsp; dynamite in the water just for fun, and that said supposedly innocent pastime unexpectedly resulted&nbsp; in the&nbsp; killing&nbsp; of a large fish&nbsp; valued at ten pesos, would&nbsp; involve an&nbsp; unreasonable presumption,&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as&nbsp; an&nbsp; extraordinary&nbsp; coincidence. People do not&nbsp; usually&nbsp; assume the&nbsp; risk&nbsp; of&nbsp; handling explosives such as dynamite with its consequent dangers to human life, and waste the value&nbsp; of&nbsp; said explosives which could&nbsp; otherwise be utilized for legitimate purposes, just for fun.&nbsp; And fishes, like those called <i>tamban</i>, are not so abundant and always near the surface of&nbsp; the sea that any explosion of&nbsp; a stick of dynamite thrown at random, without&nbsp; any purpose&nbsp; other than&nbsp; for fun, and&nbsp; without aim or deliberation, could not but hit them as a target&nbsp; with fatal results.&nbsp; The theory of&nbsp; appellant does&nbsp; not appeal to the credulity of this Tribunal.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; the information in the present case is entitled "Illegal Fishing with Explosives", so that&nbsp; there could have been&nbsp; no doubt&nbsp; in the&nbsp; mind&nbsp; of appellant who was&nbsp; then assisted by&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; being charged&nbsp; with exploding dynamite for purposes of fishing illegally, this apart from&nbsp; the fact that among&nbsp; the&nbsp; exhibits which the prosecution&nbsp; was going to present in evidence to support the charge,&nbsp; evidently confiscated from the accused at the time he was caught in the act of&nbsp; fishing with explosives, and&nbsp; which&nbsp; were&nbsp; listed in&nbsp; the&nbsp; information,&nbsp; were&nbsp; the following:<br><blockquote>One (l) bag of dried fish<br>One (1) Goggles<br>One (1) fish nets<br>One (1) paddle, and<br>One (1) baroto<br></blockquote>The last four articles clearly show that the accused was fishing.&nbsp; And, as already stated, he pleaded guilty to the charge.&nbsp; In&nbsp; addition, the intent may be rightly presumed from the result of the act.&nbsp; Cubelo exploded a stick of dynamite in the water and killed a large fish&nbsp; valued at ten pesos.&nbsp;&nbsp; The logical presumption is that the explosion was for the purpose of fishing, that is to say, to catch that big fish which at the time he knew was&nbsp; near him or within the area where he threw the stick of&nbsp; dynamite.<br><br>Appellant&nbsp; also&nbsp; claims&nbsp; that&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court committed error in ordering him to serve subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency in the payment of the fine, contending that Act No. 4003&nbsp; fails to provide for such subsidiary imprisonment, and being a special law, it is not subject to the provisions&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code.&nbsp; The&nbsp; second paragraph of Article 10 of said code provides that "this Code shall be supplementary to such laws, unless the latter should specially provide the contrary."&nbsp; In the&nbsp; cases of People <i>vs.</i> Dizon (G. R. No. L-8002, November 23,&nbsp; 1955), it has been&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; Articles 100 (civil liability)&nbsp; and 39&nbsp; (subsidiary penalty) are applicable&nbsp; to offenses under special laws, citing the cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Moreno (60 Phil., 178) and Copiaco <i>vs.</i> Luzon Brokerage&nbsp; (66 Phil., 184).<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David,&nbsp; JJ.,</i>concur.&nbsp; </div>
