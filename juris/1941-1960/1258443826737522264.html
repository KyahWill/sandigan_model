				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila annulling an order of the Municipal Court,, also of Manila,&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil' Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 19777&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; dismissing defendant's counterclaim&nbsp; for&nbsp; lack of&nbsp; jurisdiction;. over the same,&nbsp; and ordering the respondent Municipal Court to proceed&nbsp; with the&nbsp; hearing of&nbsp; the case&nbsp; including&nbsp; said counterclaim.<br><br>It appears that on March 22, 1952, Cristeto Reyes filed a detainer&nbsp; (termed "ejectment") case against Librada Proceso Despo in the Municipal Court&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant Despo filed an amended answer denying the allegations of the complaint charging that she was fraudulently induced to become .a lessee, and prayed, by way of counterclaim, for the recovery of the total sum of P6,000 Under 5 causes of action, to wit:<br><blockquote>(1) First cause of&nbsp; action—P500 for&nbsp; alleged improvements introduced by defendant in the premises;<br><br>(2) Second cause of action—P2,000 for moral damages allegedly&nbsp; suffered by defendant because&nbsp; of the untimely removal and demolition&nbsp; of the apartment in question;<br><br>(3) Third cause&nbsp; of action—P1,000&nbsp; for compensatory damages allegedly suffered by&nbsp; defendant because&nbsp; of the demolition of her shop at the apartment in question;<br><br>(4)&nbsp; Fourth cause of action—P2,000 for exemplary or correctional damages because of alleged&nbsp; fraudulent dealings of plaintiff with defendant;&nbsp; and<br><br>(5)&nbsp; Fifth cause of action—P500 for attorney's fees.<br></blockquote>Plaintiff moved for the dismissal of defendant's counterclaim&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggregate&nbsp; sum claimed therein exceeded the jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Court; and finding the motion meritorious, the Municipal&nbsp; Court ordered the&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the counterclaim. .&nbsp; Wherefore, defendant filed&nbsp; a petition for certiorari in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila,&nbsp; charging&nbsp; the Municipal&nbsp; Court with grave abuse of discretion and&nbsp; excess of jurisdiction in dismissing her counterclaim.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court or First Instance of Manila granted the certiorari, held that the counterclaim in question was&nbsp; within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the respondent court because each separate&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action thereunder was for an&nbsp; amount not in&nbsp; excess&nbsp; of P2,000, and, as-already&nbsp; stated, annulled the order of dismissal and directed the Municipal Court to proceed with the hearing of the case&nbsp; including the&nbsp; counterclaim.&nbsp; From&nbsp; this order of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Manila, plaintiff Cristeto Reyes&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to this Court.<br><br>The appeal must be sustained. In&nbsp; the recent case of Soriano <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Omila, 97&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 62, promulgated May&nbsp; 21, 1955&nbsp; (51&nbsp; Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [No. 7]&nbsp; 3465),&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; held that .the jurisdiction of&nbsp; a court depends, not upon&nbsp; the value or demand&nbsp; in each single cause of action&nbsp; contained in the complaint, <i>but upon the totality&nbsp; of, the demand in all the causes of action.</i>&nbsp; The, aggregate, sum of P6.000 demanded under defendant's&nbsp; counterclaim being&nbsp; beyond the , jurisdiction of the Municipal Court&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; said court "&nbsp; correctly dismissed the same for&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction.<br><br>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Go <i> vs. </i> Go, 95 Phil.,&nbsp; 878&nbsp; (June&nbsp; 30,. 1954), we drew a distinction&nbsp; between a, claim composed of several accounts each distinct from the other and arising out of different transactions,&nbsp; and another which is composed of several accounts, arising&nbsp; out of the same transaction; and we held that in the first case, the claims may be joined in a single action even if the total amount demanded exceeds the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court, but each account furnishes the teat&nbsp; of jurisdiction; while in the second case,&nbsp; the claims should&nbsp; be stated in one cause of action and cannot be divided for the purpose of bringing the case within the jurisdiction of the inferior court,&nbsp; and jurisdiction is determined by&nbsp; the total amount claimed. The present case falls within the second class; for all the five items&nbsp; of damages demanded under defendant's counterclaim admittedly arose out of&nbsp; one and the same transaction—the alleged untimely demolition of&nbsp; the apartment from which she was ejected by plaintiff.&nbsp; Hence, defendant cannot be permitted to divide or&nbsp; split her cause&nbsp; of action into several claims for the purpose&nbsp; of bringing the same within the jurisdiction of the municipal court.&nbsp; The totality of&nbsp; the amounts&nbsp; demanded in her counterclaim furnishes the test&nbsp; of&nbsp; jurisdiction; and as it exceeds P2,000, it falls within the jurisdiction of, and must be filed in, the Court of First Instance.<br><br>In support of&nbsp; its opinion that the Municipal Court&nbsp; had jurisdiction over defendant's counterclaim&nbsp; because&nbsp; each separate cause of&nbsp; action thereunder was&nbsp; for an amount not&nbsp; in excess&nbsp; of P2,000, the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila cited the cases of Argonza, et&nbsp; al. vs. International Colleges,&nbsp; (90 Phil., 470)&nbsp; dated November 29,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; and Soriano y Cia.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Jose, 47 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; (12 Sup.) 156.&nbsp; Both cases&nbsp; cited are not in point,&nbsp; for&nbsp; there, several&nbsp; plaintiffs having separate&nbsp; and distinct claims&nbsp; against the&nbsp; same defendant&nbsp; were allowed to litigate together under the rule on&nbsp; permissive&nbsp; joinder of&nbsp; parties, there being a question of&nbsp; fact common to, and a right of relief&nbsp; arising out of the same transaction&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of, all&nbsp; of them (section 6, Rule 3,&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court) ; and while&nbsp; the totality&nbsp; of&nbsp; the claims of the&nbsp; several plaintiffs exceeded the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the inferior court, we held that the&nbsp; demand of each claimant&nbsp; furnished the jurisdictional test,&nbsp; and&nbsp; so&nbsp; the justice of the peace court had jurisdiction.&nbsp; Pointing out the difference between the case of&nbsp; several&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; with separate claims suing&nbsp; under the same complaint,&nbsp; and that of&nbsp; one&nbsp; plaintiff, alleging&nbsp; in&nbsp; one&nbsp; complaint several independent causes&nbsp; of action, like&nbsp; the case at&nbsp; bar, we said:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; believes&nbsp; that the joining&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiffs having separate' claims should be controlled by the&nbsp; principle bearing on the court's jurisdiction in suits&nbsp; where&nbsp; one plaintiff alleges in one complaint several&nbsp; independent causes of action,&nbsp; in which case it is the aggregate amount&nbsp; which determines the jurisdiction..&nbsp; But there is a fundamental&nbsp; difference between such cases and. one like that before us.&nbsp; In the first,,&nbsp; the total demand accrues to one person, while in&nbsp; the latter only part&nbsp; of the combined demand, which does not exceed&nbsp; the jurisdictional&nbsp; amount, pertains to a single plaintiff. In&nbsp; other&nbsp; words, the court takes into account what one party would recover&nbsp; and not what is adjudged to&nbsp; all the&nbsp; parties or&nbsp; some&nbsp; of them."&nbsp; (Soriano&nbsp; y Cia. <i>vs. </i>Jose, supra.)<br></blockquote>&nbsp;The&nbsp; order&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; reversed,&nbsp; and the order&nbsp; of the Municipal&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; dismissing defendant-appellee Librada Proceso Despo's counterclaim is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against&nbsp; defendant-appellee.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><i>Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; J., </i>concurs in the result.<br></div>
