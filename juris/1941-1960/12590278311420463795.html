				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of the order of the Public Service Commission, herein referred to as the Commission dated May 10, 1957, dismissing the application of petitioners Ernesto A. Papa and Conrado&nbsp; V. Atanacio for&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; of public convenience and&nbsp; necessity to&nbsp; operate&nbsp; a telephone service in Pasig, Rizal.<br><br>The facts, as may be gathered&nbsp; from the petition, the order sought to be&nbsp; reviewed, the briefs of petitioners and of respondent Severo J. Santiago, and their&nbsp; memoranda filed in lieu of oral argument, may be stated as follows: Under resolution No. 217, dated November 27, 1954, the Municipal&nbsp; Council&nbsp; of Pasig,&nbsp; Rizal,&nbsp; granted&nbsp; respondent Santiago&nbsp; a municipal franchise to&nbsp; operate&nbsp; a&nbsp; telephone service&nbsp; in Pasig.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that this resolution was&nbsp; not approved by the Provincial Board, as required by Act No. 667 as amended by Act No.&nbsp; 1022.&nbsp; The Provincial Board returned&nbsp; it, disapproving&nbsp; the resolution, advising&nbsp; the Council that the application for said&nbsp; franchise be&nbsp; submitted to public bidding.<br><br>The same Municipal&nbsp; Council of Pasig approved&nbsp; Resolution No. 212 dated December 22,&nbsp; 1955, granting to petitioners Papa and Atanacio a municipal franchise to operate a telephone service in Pasig.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said franchise was granted after a sealed bidding conducted by the council, in which respondent Santiago took part but lost.&nbsp; Santiago claims in his brief that he did&nbsp; not participate&nbsp; in this bidding, but petitioners answered without denial on Santiago's part that he,&nbsp; Santiago,&nbsp; really took part through the Republic Telephone Co., Inc., of which he was president and principal stockholder.<br><br>As required by law (Act No.&nbsp; 667), the&nbsp; said Municipal Resolution No. 212 was referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Provincial Board of Rizal for approval.&nbsp; According to petitioners, it was approved&nbsp; by the Provincial&nbsp; Board on January 25,&nbsp; 1956, in its Resolution No.&nbsp; 119.&nbsp; What the Provincial&nbsp; Board really said in its resolution No. 119&nbsp; was as follows:<br><blockquote>"IT&nbsp; WAS&nbsp; RESOLVED to&nbsp; respectfully&nbsp; forward the aforementioned resolution to the Public Service Commission and&nbsp; the Office&nbsp; of the President of the Philippines, <span style="font-style: italic;">recommending approva</span>l. "Carried."&nbsp; (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>Following&nbsp; said resolution of the&nbsp; Board, petitioners Papa and&nbsp; Atanacio, on February 18, 1956, filed an application in Case No.&nbsp; 24119 of the Public Service Commission&nbsp; for a certificate of public&nbsp; convenience and necessity to operate a telephone service in Pasig, Rizal, and completed submission&nbsp; of their evidence in support thereof on November 28, 1956.<br><br>In&nbsp; the meantime,&nbsp; the same Municipal Council&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pasig passed Resolution No. 245 on December 12, 1956,&nbsp; revoking the franchise given&nbsp; to petitioners Papa and Atanacio,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; they had failed to&nbsp; install&nbsp; a telephone service.&nbsp; This municipal resolution was approved by&nbsp; the Provincial Board on February 13, 1957, by Resolution No. 192, amended by its Resolution&nbsp; No. 204 of February 18, 1957.<br><br>The&nbsp; Municipal Council&nbsp; on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 10,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; in its&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolution&nbsp; No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 186, granted&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Santiago a franchise to operate a telephone service in Pasig.&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; called this resolution&nbsp; a&nbsp; revival&nbsp; of&nbsp; its original Resolution No. 217, dated November 27, 1954, which was not&nbsp; approved by the Provincial&nbsp; Board.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Municipal Resolution No. 186 was approved by the Provincial Board on November 12, 1956 by its Resolution No. 1437.&nbsp;&nbsp; After said Board's resolution Santiago&nbsp; filed his application with the&nbsp; Public Service&nbsp; Commission&nbsp;&nbsp; on November&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1956, amending it on November 23, 1956, also for a certificate of public convenience and&nbsp; necessity to operate&nbsp; a telephone service in Pasig, in case No.&nbsp; 101261.&nbsp; He finished&nbsp; submitting his evidence on February 15, 1957.&nbsp; Both applications of the petitioners and respondent were heard&nbsp; by the Commission,&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; mutually&nbsp; asking for&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal of&nbsp; each&nbsp; other's application.&nbsp; Presumably, because the application of petitioners was submitted first, the Commission acted upon and decided it by its&nbsp; order of May 10, 1957, now sought to be reviewed.<br><br>In his&nbsp; motion for the dismissal of the application&nbsp; of petitioners, Santiago&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioners franchise had been revoked by resolution of the Municipal Council, approved by the Provincial Board, and that consequently, there was no existing franchise on which the Commission could act and base any grant of a certificate of public convenience and necessity.&nbsp; Ruling upon this claim and question raised, the Commission, in our opinion, correctly held that the Municipal&nbsp; Council and Provincial Board had&nbsp; no right to revoke a franchise already&nbsp; granted,&nbsp; unless there be a valid reason for doing so; that a franchise constitutes a contract between&nbsp; the grantor and grantee, and&nbsp; that it cannot be impaired&nbsp; except for good&nbsp; reasons.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason or excuse, according to the Commission,&nbsp; given by the Municipal Council&nbsp; in revoking the franchise granted&nbsp; to the petitioners, was that the latter failed to install the telephone service involved in the franchise.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the&nbsp; Commission rightly argued&nbsp; and ruled&nbsp; that petitioners could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be expected&nbsp; to&nbsp; make the installation until&nbsp; and&nbsp; unless their franchise&nbsp; was acted upon&nbsp; favorably by the&nbsp; Commission by&nbsp; a grant of the corresponding certificate of public convenience and necessity, and approved by the Chief&nbsp; Executive, and at the time of the revocation&nbsp; by the Municipal Council, petitioners&nbsp; had not yet obtained said approval of the&nbsp; Commission and of the&nbsp; President.&nbsp; For&nbsp; this&nbsp; reason, the&nbsp; Commission denied Santiago's petition for dismissal. <br><br>The Commission, however, evidently on its own initiative, found&nbsp; and held that the action&nbsp; taken by the Provincial Board by its resolution forwarding the municipal resolution granting a&nbsp; franchise to&nbsp; petitioners,&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Commission and&nbsp; to the President <i>recommending&nbsp; approval</i>,&nbsp; was not the express and explicit approval required by the lawâ€” Section 2 of Act 667, which states that "no franchise&nbsp; shall become operative until the same shall&nbsp; have been approved by the Municipal Council, and secondly, by the Provincial Board."&nbsp; The question&nbsp; now to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; is&nbsp; whether&nbsp; a recommendation for approval is equivalent to and may be regarded as&nbsp; an approval.&nbsp; Petitioners call our attention to authoritative definitions of and the import of the words and&nbsp; phrase "approval,"&nbsp; "approved,"&nbsp; "recommending approval" and their&nbsp; connotations.&nbsp; We shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; quibble about their significance and shades of meaning.&nbsp; We propose to approach the question from a practical and realistic standpoint.<br><br>By recommending approval,&nbsp; may&nbsp; it be&nbsp; said that the Provincial&nbsp; Board truly and practically approved the Municipal Council resolution granting a franchise to petitioners?&nbsp; It is not improbable that the Provincial Board may have entertained the belief that by recommending approval,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; approving&nbsp; the measure,&nbsp; assuming that the members&nbsp; thereof were adequately informed&nbsp; of the&nbsp; legal provision requiring approval.&nbsp; Another aspects of the&nbsp; question is that&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Council resolution was referred to the Provincial Board, as required by law, the Board was expected to take some positive action&nbsp; on the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could: (1) <i>approve</i>&nbsp; the resolution; (2) <i>disapprove</i>&nbsp; it; (3)&nbsp; forward the&nbsp; case&nbsp; to the Commission and to the President without any recommendation; (4) forward the same&nbsp; recommending <i>disapproval</i>;&nbsp; or&nbsp; (5) <i>recommending approval</i> as it&nbsp; did.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Provincial Board&nbsp; neither&nbsp; disapproved it, nor recommended its disapproval, and although it did not expressly approved the resolution, it recommended its approval by the higher authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; In our&nbsp; opinion, the&nbsp; favorable attitude of the Board to the&nbsp; measure,&nbsp; as clearly expressed in its recommendation for approval may correctly and reasonably be regarded as an approval in the&nbsp; eyes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law.&nbsp; Consequently, the franchise granted by the Municipal Council to the petitioners was perfected and became&nbsp; operative, though still subject to the action&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Commission and Chief Executive.<br><br>Moreover,&nbsp; that intention of the&nbsp; Provincial Board&nbsp; was subsequently clarified and reiterated when upon the request of petitioners that it clarify and define its intention in recommending to the Commission and the President&nbsp; the approval of the municipal&nbsp; resolution, the Board passed a resolution authorizing the secretary to inform petitioners accordingly, which the&nbsp; secretary did, telling them that the Board&nbsp; really&nbsp;&nbsp; approved the&nbsp; measure.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; the Commission had previously accepted and&nbsp; construed, though perhaps incidentally, a recommendation for approval by a Provincial Board of a municipal resolution granting a franchise.&nbsp; In Case No. 76560 of the Commission, the Caramoan Electric Power&nbsp; Cooperative&nbsp; Association secured a municipal franchise to install and operate an electric, light, heat and power service in the municipality of Caramoan by virtue of a municipal resolution.&nbsp; When it reached the Provincial Board,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; instead of approving the resolution, merely referred the same to the Public Service Commission, <i>recommending</i> approval, and said action of the Board&nbsp; was considered&nbsp; and interpreted by the Commission as an&nbsp; approval within the meaning&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law,&nbsp; and the Commission,&nbsp; in its decision of March 2,&nbsp; 1956, granted the corresponding&nbsp; certificate&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; public&nbsp;&nbsp; convenience&nbsp;&nbsp; and necessity.<br><br>Pending appeal, we&nbsp; had issued a writ of injunction on the Commission so as to suspend action&nbsp; on the application of Santiago,&nbsp; because otherwise, if in&nbsp; the meantime the Commission&nbsp; favorably acted upon&nbsp; his application&nbsp; and issued to him a certificate of public convenience and necessity to install and operate a telephone system in Pasig, then the application of petitioners for a similar certificate would be seriously jeopardized, and may even have to be dismissed, or denied.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason is that&nbsp; for&nbsp; a small community&nbsp; like Pasig,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; hard to imagine that&nbsp; more than one party or entity&nbsp; could operate a telephone system. with&nbsp; profit.&nbsp; The Commission&nbsp; would, in&nbsp; all probability allow only one&nbsp; operator, and it is to be presumed that the Municipal Council itself&nbsp; and the Provincial&nbsp; Board&nbsp; inf tended to grant a franchise to only one applicant, as shown. by&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that although Santiago was first in&nbsp; applying for a franchise, the&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; application of petitioners was approved only after Santiago's application was practically disapproved, because it had been submitted to public bidding; and that the&nbsp; application&nbsp; of Santiago&nbsp; was&nbsp; subsequently revived by the Council&nbsp; and approved by the Provincial Board&nbsp; only&nbsp; after&nbsp; the Council&nbsp; and the Board had, presumably,&nbsp; decided to revoke the franchise granted to the petitioners&nbsp; for their failure to&nbsp; install the telephone system.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of&nbsp; the foregoing, the&nbsp; appealed order of dismissal is hereby set aside and the case is ordered remanded to the Commission for further proceedings.&nbsp; As&nbsp; to which of the two applicants is&nbsp; entitled to a certificate of public convenience and necessity, assuming that they&nbsp; are both qualified, rests&nbsp; in&nbsp; the sound discretion of the Commission. The Commission&nbsp; may, however,&nbsp; take into&nbsp; consideration the fact that as between&nbsp; the two, the petitioners&nbsp; obtained an operative franchise from the Council and the Provincial Board first; also that they were the first&nbsp; in&nbsp; filing an application with the Commission and in completing the submission&nbsp; of their evidence.&nbsp; Petitioners also informed the Court in their&nbsp; pleadings that they&nbsp; have already&nbsp; made investments and expenditures&nbsp; in preparation for the future operation of the franchise, in the sum of P60,000.&nbsp; We have no evidence before us as to the correctness and validity of said claim, which may well be considered by the! Commission.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
