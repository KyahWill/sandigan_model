				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is  a  petition for review  of a   decision of  the Public Service Commission  authorizing  respondent  Teodolfo  Ascano  to  operate  three  (3) auto-trucks for  the transportation of passengers  and  freight  on  the  line Tumauini-Baggao via Tuguegarao  and  vice-versa.</p>
<p>It appears that respondent Ascano had filed  an application for authority to operate  six  (6) units on said line; that the Bachrach Motor Company, Inc., and the Red Line Transportation Co., Inc., objected to said application; and that, in due course, the Public. Service  Commission  rendered  a  decision,  pertinent  parts  of  which  reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"From the  evidence  submitted  by the  applicant, it  appears that there are  more 34  barrios  between Tumauini  and  Tuguegarao and  19 barrios between Tuguegarao and Baggao;  that all  these barrios are thickly populated;  that Tumauini alone has from  5,000 inhabitants more or  less, while  Awitan, a barrio  of San Pablo, Isabela, has  around 300 family heads;  that  without  taking into account the inhabitants of the other barrios between Tumauini and Baggao via Tuguegarao, there  are already around 12,000 passengers  in the region  mentioned who may travel along the line  applied for; that from Baggao to Tuguegarao the  oppositor, the Red Line Transportation Company has only one trip a day, while the Rural Transit has no trips from Tuguegarao to Baggao; that on  account of the heavy traffic on the  line  applied  for, trucks operating between Tumauini to points beyond Baybayod Junction are almost always fully loaded with passengers  and  passengers have to wait fof a long time before they could be accommodated.  The Municipal  Council  of Tuguegarao,  Cagayan, realizing  the  need  for additional TPU truck services, either between Tuguegarao  and Tumauini or from  Tuguegarao  to  Baggao  or points after  Tuguegarao but before Baggao, passed Resolution No.  79 on  September 4,  1953,  favorably  recommending approval of the application  filed by  the  herein applicant, stating as one of the reasons  the  fact  that authorized  TPU truck operators operating on long  distance trips do not stop at intermediate points only, especially  so when these  passengers carry baggages. Applicant has P10,000 deposit in the Philippine National Bank; earns about PI ,000 a month as a  dentist and  has properties consisting of dental equipment,  agricultural and residential  lots  and a house worth around P97,000.   Applicant's income from  the  buy and  sell    business is from  P500  to  P600 a  month.  Applicant has  already acquired three of the six units he is applying for and these are now ready for operation  as soon  as his  application  is  approved.</p>
  <p>"On the  other hand, oppositors  presented  evidence to the effect that there are few passengers on the line applied for; that  passengers  between Tumauini and points  before Baybayod  Junction  and Baggao  are being  adequately served not only by  short distance operators  passing  Tumauini,  Tuguegarao  and  Baybayod Junction to points in the direction  of  Aparri; that on ordinary days their buses  carry from 12-15 passengers  only; that in view  of the  few passengers on the line, they  suffered  losses  and the granting of the present application  will  result, in ruinous competition.   Oppositors also reproduced in evidence the report of the  Checkers of the Commission stationed at Tuguegarao,  Cagayan, was made a  record of all Trucks passing Tuguegarao to either south  or north of  Tuguegarao, from May 21, 1953, both  dates  inclusive.  Oppositor, Rural Transit, presented the  toll  collector at  Balasig Bridge who  testified that trucks passing this toll bridge  carry only from 1/2 to  2/3  of their carrying  capacity, altho he admitted on cross examination  that it was not his duty to observe the number  of passengers  in those trucks passing  the toll  bridge and  the  figures given  by  him  are mere calculations.</p>
  <p>"A  scrutiny of the records  of said Checkers stationed at  Tuguegarao, Cagayan, from May 8, to  21, 1953,  reveals that  there  are around thirteen  (13)  trucks  bearing  T plates  operating  between Tuguegarao and Baggao, between Tuguegarao-Nabalan, and  between Tumauini and Tuguegarao which, are devote to the transportation of passengers between said points;  and that these  T trucks  are not authorized for TPU operations and  their  existence and operation in the region indicate the need for additional TPU services therein. "After a careful consideration of the evidence submitted by both parties, as well as the records of the Commission on existing  public services dn the line applied for, the Commission  is convinced that the granting of the present application for three (3) units only, instead of six units originally applied for,  is justified."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only the Red Line Transportation  Company, Inc. has appealed from this decision.   In its brief, it alleges that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>"The  Public Service Commission  erred in  granting the respondent, a certificate of public convenience  to operate a TPU service  on  the Tuguegarao-Tumauini line based principally on  the existence and operation of T-trucks which are devoted  to the  transportation  of passengers.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"The  Public Service Commission erred in holding  that the records of the  Commission on existing public services on the line applied for', justified the  granting of the application.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"The  Public Service  Commission erred  in failing to give due protection  to the capital  investment of  the  petitioner."</li>
</ol>
<p>In support; of the first assignment of error,  it is urged that there is no  evidence to the effect that the  thirteen f (13) T-trucks—not authorized for TPU operations—found to have been transporting passengers between Tuguegarao and Baggao,  between  Tuguegarao and Nabalan, and  between Tumauini and f uguegarao, had charged any fare for the services thus rendered to them and that,  accordingly, we must assume that said  passengers had paid nothing therefor, the presumption being that the law has been complied with, not violated.   This view, however, runs counter , to the ordinary course  of events  for the transportation of passengers, specially when repeatedly made, entails expenditures which the  owners of  said  T-trucks cannot be presumed to be willing to bear gratis  et amore.  In short, it was not unreasonable for the Public  Service Commission to conclude that the passengers of said T-trucks were accommodated for a monetary  consideration, in the absence of proof to the contrary, and there is  none to this effect. Under its second assignment of error petitioner makes, in its brief,  a list of the trips  already authorized to be made  from   Tuguegarao,  northward  and  from  Baggao, southward, and maintains that the  same are  sufficient to) meet the demands of the public convenience in said localities.   This pretense is  untenable, for none of the trips included in said list covers the line Tumauini-Baggao, via Tuguegarao,  and vice-versa, to which respondent's application  refers.  Besides, the Commission took specific note of the  number of  public  utilities already  in  operation therein when it concluded that the granting of respondent's application for three (3) units  would promote public convenience.   Considering the number of barrios traversed by the line in question, as well as the population thereof, the number of passengers traveling  in  said region and the thirteen (13) T-trucks engaged therein in the transportation of passengers, although not authorized for TPU operation, we cannot say  that the Public Service Commission has abused its discretion in making said finding,  which, consequently, should  not be disturbed.</p>
<p>As regards the  third assignment of  error,  petitioner says that it has suffered losses in the sum of 11,215.35, on account of the operation of its service in the line in question, for a period 6i nine (9)  months, and that the order appealed from would have the  effect of  imposing greater losses  upon said petitioner, to  the damage  and prejudice of its business.  The only evidence on said alleged losses consists, however, of a profit  and loss statement  of petitioner herein, without any proof whatsoever of its accuracy.  It is obviously inadequate to establish the existence of said alleged losses.</p>
<p>Besides, the same, if true, may be due to flaws in the management or to causes other than ruinous competition among  the public utility operators  Indeed,  the fact that only two (2)  of them objected to respondent's application, that petitioner was the only one who appealed from the decision in favor of  respondent herein and that there are many  units  operating in the  line in question,  although without authority therefor, apart from the other circumstances pointed out in said decision, strongly indicate that the passenger traffic in  said line is sufficiently heavy to justify the action complained of.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the decision appealed  from  is  hereby  affirmed, with costs against the petitioner,  It is so ordered.</p>
