				G.R. No. L-7685, September 23, 1955</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR PHILIPPINES CITIZENSHIP. NABIH AWAD, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal, taken by petitioner Nabih. Awad, from a decision of the 
Court of First Instance of Davao, denying his application for naturalization as 
citizen of the Philippines, upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to 
establish his ability to read and write a principal local dialect. 
<p>In this connection, petitioner testified that he was born in Lebanon, in 
1924; that he came to the Philippines in 1936; that, since then, he had resided 
continuously in the Philippines, having returned to Lebanon only once in 1948; 
that he studied up to the first year high school; that he knows how to read and 
write English; that he understood the contents of his petition, which is in 
Spanish; and that, he can speak the Visayan and the Tagalog dialects. Although 
there is no direct evidence that he can write either dialect, his ability to do 
so is conceded by the Solicitor General, for, having reached first year high 
school, he is literate and, as such, may be deemed capable of writing the 
dialects he speaks, namely, the Visayan and the Tagalog, which are phonetic. 
(Lao Chin Kieng <em>vs</em>. Republic of the Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> 40 Off. Gaz., 2654, 2656.)</p>
<p>This notwithstanding, we are of the opinion that petitioner's application for 
naturalization has been properly dismissed. Pursuant to section 7 of the Revised 
Naturalization Law (Commonwealth Act No. 473), an applicant for naturalization 
must attach' to his petition the affidavits of at least two credible persons 
stating "that they are citizens of the Philippines <em>and personally know the 
petitioner to be a resident of the Philippines for the period of time required 
by this Act</em>" This period is ten (10) years (Section 2, Commonwealth Act No, 
473), except when petitioner falls within certain specified classes— namely, 
"having been born in the Philippines"; or "being married to a Filipino woman"; 
or "having been engaged as a teacher in the Philippines in a public or 
recognized private school * * * for * * * not less than two years"; or "having 
honorably held office under the government of the Philippines or of its local 
subdivisions"; or "having established a new industry or introduced a new 
invention in the Philippines" (Sec. 2)—to neither of which classes petitioner 
herein belongs. In other words, for the <em>validity</em> of petitioner's 
application (See Cu <em>vs</em>. Republic of the Philippines, L-3018, decided on 
July 18, 1951) it is essential that the same be supported by the affidavits of 
two citizens of the Philippines <em>who knew Mm to be a resident thereof for at 
least ten (10) years</em>.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, petitioner's application was accompanied by the 
affidavits of Jesus V. Oceña and Gregorio P. Manongdo. The latter did not take 
the witness stand, whereas the former testified that he came to know petitioner 
in 1947, or only five (5) years prior to the filing of petitioner's application 
on December 4, 1952. It is obvious, therefore, that the same is fatally 
defective and must necessarily be dismissed.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against 
petitioner herein. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador</em> and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>
