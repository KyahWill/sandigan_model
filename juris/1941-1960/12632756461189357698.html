				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the evening of the 16th of May, 1945 (pp. 39, 41, 45, t. s. n.), Amadeo 
Bernadez, 3rd Lieutenant of Philippine Army, ordered Eustaquio Altamarino, a 
private under his command, to bring Gabriel Ricablanca, who was detained in the 
municipal jail of Guihulngan, Oriental Negros, to a certain place in the beach 
where a pit had been dug. In obedience to the order, AItamarino brought Gabriel 
Ricablanca, tied by the Hands on his back, to the place and there the latter was 
shot six times at the nape and the back by Amadeo Bernadez at a distance of 
three paces (pp. 22, 46, 47, 51, 74, t. s. n.). After emptying his .38-caliber 
revolver, he told Francisco It-it to "finish" Ricablanca, and Francisco fired a 
shot at the latter's back. After Ricablanca had fallen down dead, Amadeo 
Bernadez ordered that lie be buried in the pit. 
<p>For the death of Ricablanca Amadeo Bernadez and Francisco It-it were charged 
with murder. After trial Francisco It-it, was acquitted of the charge, but 
Bernadez was found guilty and sentenced to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, 
with the accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the 
sum of P2,000, and to pay the costs. He appeals. </p>
<p>Appellant admits that he shot Ricablanca to death (pp. 73-74, t. s. n.), but 
pleads in defense that he merely complied with the order of his superior 
officer, as shown in Exhibit 1, and invokes in his favor article 11, paragraph 
6, of the Revised Penal Code. Exhibit 1 purports to be a memorandum signed by C.N. Bernadez, 1st Lieutenant Infantry, Executive Officer, addressed to the 
appellant, ordering the latter to execute immediately a judgment imposing death 
penalty imposing death penalty upon Gabriel Ricablanca rendered on the same date 
appearing in the memorandum order.</p>
<p>Appellant's defense is untenable, because by comparing the signature "C.N. 
Bernadez" in the memorandum order, Exhibit 1, with the admittedly genuine 
signatures "C.N. Bernadez" in Exhibits A to K, marked differences in the 
strokes are noticeable, especially in the capital letter "C" at the beginning, 
and in the small letter "z" at the end, of the signatures. ,The position of the 
letters in the genuine signatures is almost vertical, whereas in the questioned 
signature the letters slant toward the right. In the questioned signature the 
letters are quite apart one from the other, whereas in the genuine signatures 
they are close to each other. There was no report on the arrest of Ricablanca; 
nor was there an investigation of him ordered by the headquarters; neither was 
there a report by Lieutenant Cirilo N. Bernadez on the investigation of 
Ricablanca (p. 85, t. s. n.). There was no report made by the appellant to his 
superior officer on the execution of Ricablanca as it was the requirement in 
such cases (pp. 87, 97-99, t. s. n.). And it is significant that after shooting 
the victim, the appellant told the onlookers or bystanders not to reveal it and 
to say, if asked, that it was merely a target practice (pp. 12-13, t. s. n.). If 
the appellant acted aboveboard, as he pretends, he would not have cautioned them 
not to reveal the shooting of Ricablanca which caused his death.</p>
<p>Marino Jobillo, the batallion commander of the executive officer who signed 
the memorandum order Exhibit 1, testifies that no judgment had been rendered 
against Ricablanca and no order had been issued by him authorizing his execution 
(pp. 91-92, t. s. n.). Hermenegildo Mercado, the commanding officer of the Whole 
East Negros sector (USAFFE) , testifies that his orders were to the effect that 
all persons arrested should be turned over to tiie headquarters and Report 
thereon should be made; that Ricablanca had never been brought to the 
headquarters and no report regarding him had been made; and that he did not 
appoint any court martial to try Ricablanca and did not order his execution (pp. 
97-99, t.s.n.). Cresencio Bernadez, testifying for his first degree cousin, the 
appellant (p. 70, t. s. n.), says that he was the officer of the day on the 16th 
of May, 1943 (p. 63, t. s. n.), and that he did not know that Ricablanca was 
tried on that day (pp. 68-69, t. s. n.).</p>
<p>All these facts show that the execution of Ricablanca was unauthorised and 
unlawful. By the memorandum order, Exhibit 1, an attempt is made to shift the 
responsibility to the late Cirilo N. Bernadez, the executive officer who 
purportedly signed it. He was killed in December 1943 (p. 69, t. s. n.). The 
order to execute Ricablanca being illegal, the provisions of article 11, 
paragraph 6, of the Revised Penal Code can not be invoked to exempt the 
appellant from criminal responsibility arising from the killing of 
Ricablanca.</p>
<p>It is argued that if the intention of the appellant was just to kill 
Ricablanca, he would not have done so in the presence of some witnesses. But the 
latter were appellant's subordinates who had dug the pit, brought the victim to 
the beach, and buried him in the pit. Counsel overlooks appellant's conduct 
after shooting the deceased. He warned those who had witnessed the incident not 
to reveal what they had seen and to say, if asked, that it was merely a target 
practice. As stated elsewhere in this opinion, such conduct shows that the 
appellant acted with malice and criminal intent. </p>
<p>It is urged that even if the memorandum order were forged, still the 
appellant cannot be held responsible for the death of Ricablanca, because it has 
'not been shown that the appellant is the one who had forged it. In other words, 
it is contended that even if the memorandum order were forged, still the 
appellant acted in good faith when he complied with it. From the fact that the 
memorandum order is forged; that no trial or proceedings had taken place where a 
judgment against Ricablanca could or might have been rendered; that the superior 
officers of the appellant had not ordered Ricablanca's execution; that no report 
on said execution had been made, it may logically be inferred that the appellant 
forged it or caused it to be forged to be relieved from criminal responsibility 
arising from the killing of Ricablanca. Appellant's failure to submit a report 
on the compliance with the order of execution is a strong proof that he did not 
receive such memorandum order. At the time of the killing of Ricablanca, 
Guihulngan was in a troubled condition, and from the evidence it may be drawn 
that the Bernadez brothers were in ascendancy in the locality on account of the 
fact that at least two brothers and some close relatives were in the Army (p. 
17, t. s. n.). And suspecting Ricablanca of some wrongdoing, the brother of the 
appellant, Eugenio Bernadez, called him, but as Ricablanca, instead of heeding 
the call, ran away, Eugenio Bernadez shot him for disobeying his order (pp. 
13-14, t. s. n.). There is no doubt that Eugenio Bernadez was quick in making 
use of his gun because of the belief that their power would last for some time 
and that the wrong he might commit could be explained or justified by him. Such 
was also the mental attitude of the appellant when he shot Ricablanca to 
death.</p>
<p>There being no modifying circumstances and the penalty imposed by the trial 
court being in accordance With article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the 
judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Parás, Actg. C. J., Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon, 
Briones,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br>PARÁS: Acting Chief 
Justice. I hereby certify that Mr. Chief Justice Moran voted for affirmance of 
the judgment appealed from.</p></div>
