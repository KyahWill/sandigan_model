				<H3>TAN GIN SAN, PETITIONER, VS. ROSALIA A. TAN CARPIZO ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE INTESTATE OF TAN CUAN, DECEASED, HON. LEOVIGILDO B. MIJARES, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF ZAMBOANGA CITY, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Three litigations are now pending before the court of first instance of 
Zamboanga City concerning two buildings of strong materials in the same city 
owned by Tan Cuan, deceased.<p></p>
<p>The first, Civil Case No. 608, is a suit wherein the administratrix of his 
intestate, his widow Rosalia A. Tan Carpizo, seeks the annulment of a chattel 
mortgage on the building reportedly executed by Tan Cuan during his lifetime in 
favor of Tan Gin San. She denies execution thereof by Tan Cuan, and alleges that 
in case it was duly executed it is illegal as to one-half, since the property 
belongs to their conjugal partnership, and she did not sign the mortgage 
deed.</p>
<p>In the second, Civil Case No. 610, Tan Gin San tries to obtain legal 
possession of the two buildings, which the administratrix refused to surrender, 
even after extra-judicial proceedings to foreclose the chattel mortgage had been 
duly carried out through the intervention of the Sheriff.</p>
<p>As the two buildings were leased to several tenants. the latter were 
subjected to conflicting claims regarding the rents of the occupied premises. 
Consequently, sixteen of tttem, Santiago Bernardo, et al. instituted the third 
Civil Case No. 648 for interpleader. Therein they made deposits of the monthly 
rentals when and as they become due. Therein also were issued the orders of the 
respondent judge dated February 16, 1957, April 29, 1957, May 7, 1957, etc. 
which gave rise to the institution of this petition for certiorari. Said orders 
authorized the administratrix to withdraw and receive from the Clerk of Court 
the amounts deposited as rents by the tenants of the aforesaid buildings.</p>
<p>Citing Rivera vs. Ocampo<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2"><sup>[1]</sup></span> wherein we 
held it impermissible, in interpleader cases, to deliver' to one party the money 
deposited in court even upon the filing of a bond, and alleging excess of 
jurisdiction or abuse of discretion, plus irreparable damages, petitioner asked 
for preliminary injunction, which was in due course granted after submission of 
a suitable bond.</p>
<p>The tenants, who were made respondents expressed, in their answer, their 
objection to the disputed orders. However, inasmuch as they may not be required 
again to pay the rentals they have already deposited, they have really no 
interest in the matter, their stand may be disregarded and the controversy may be 
limited to petitioner against Rosalia Tan.</p>
<p>The respondent judge is a mere nominal party. The respondent administratrix 
is actually the one called upon to defend. And she explains, in her answer, that 
the orders were necessary consequence of the court's directive in Civil Case No. 
610 on December 29, 1956, requiring the sheriff to return the possession of the 
two buildings to her; that possession was thus restored to her; that her 
possession necessarily entailed the right to collect rents from the tenants; 
that it was too late for petitioner to complaint, since he did not appeal nor 
question in a higher court the order restoring possession, which has thereby 
become final; that anyway the rights of petitioner are amply secured by the, 
bond of P140,000 the administratrix had filed in Civil Case No. 610.</p>
<p>Disputing this last proposition, petitioner denies the legal feasibility of 
extending the surety's liability-without its consent-under the bond in Civil 
Case No. 610 to the damages resulting from an order in another Civil Case No. 
648. To settle this point it becomes necessary to describe the background and 
the terms of the bond filed in Civil Case No. 610, which as stated aimed to 
wrest possession of the buildings from the administratrix.</p>
<p>It seems clear from the pleadings and annexes thereto, that in said Civil 
Case No. 610, plaintiff Tan Gin San (secured, by an order of replevin the 
surrender to him of the two buildings which had been extra-judicially 
foreclosed; that subsequently, acting on a petition of Rosalia Tan which 
asserted nullity of said foreclosure in view of the ruling of this Court in 
Manarang vs. Ofilada<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style2"><sup>[1]</sup></span> the judge impliedly 
annulling the foreclosure, declared the administratrix entitled to the return of 
the buildings "upon the posting of a bond of P140,000 to answer for the alleged 
unpaid loan and for any damage which plaintiff" (Tan Gin San) may suffer by 
virtue thereof. (November 16, 1956.) The bond was submitted, and the sheriff 
redelivered possession to the administratrix in January 1957.</p>
<p>Now, in ordering delivery of the rentals deposited in court in Civil Case No. 
648 the Court expressly said it was giving effect to the orders in Civil Case 
No. 610 declaring the administratrix's right to possession of buildings and 
returning them to her. Therefore, it would not be erroneous to hold that if the 
deposited rentals should be lost, the damages, if any, suffered thereby is a 
mere consequence of the return of possession and is chargeable against the bond 
of P140,000.</p>
<p>The petitioner's credit, secured by the mortgage is P40,000 with interest at 
6 per cent beginning February 28, 1958. At the time this petition was filed, 
such credit did not exceed P46,000. He has therefore no serious ground for 
concern because the bond is amply sufficient.</p>
<p>Turning to the issues of jurisdiction or discretion, the court undoubtedly 
had jurisdiction; the moneys were in court in a litigation properly within its 
competence. And no authority is cited to the contrary.</p>
<p>Was there abuse of discretion? We think not. The rentals accrued in and after 
December 1956. Yet in November 1956, the court had declared and upheld the 
possessory right over the buildings of the administratrix, thereby overruling 
the claims of Tan Gin San as mortgage creditor-temporarily of course.</p>
<p>The right to possession of the buildings includes the right to the use or the 
fruits thereof. Rentals, which are civil fruits (Waite vs. Williams, 5 Phil., 
571) belong to the possessor in good faith (Art. 544 New Civil Code). 
Furthermore, and this is conclusive, Tan Gin San considers Tan Cuan the owner of 
the buildings. Therefore, Tan Cuan (or his estate represented by Rosalia Tan) is 
entitled to the rents, in the absence of better rights of Tan Gin San - which the 
latter has not shown.<br><br>And this brings us to Rivera vs. Ocampo, supra, on 
which rests the petitioner's contentions. There we held it was abuse of 
discretion, in interpleader cases, to allow one of the contestants to get the 
money deposited, even upon the filing of a bond. But that case is 
distinguishable from this in that the order permitting withdrawal was avowedly 
for the purpose of helping one of the claimants; whereas here it was permitted 
as a consequence of the court's previous order-final it seems-awarding to 
Rosalia Tan possession of the rented premises. A further distinction is that 
whereas in the Rivera case the right to the money was disputed among several 
interested parties, in this case the right of the owner and the possessor to 
rents is reasonably clear.</p>
<p>Everything considered, we perceive no grave abuse of discretion calling for 
the issuance of <i>certiorari</i>. Accordingly, the petition is denied, and the 
injunction heretofore issued is dissolved. Costs against petitioner.</p>

Endencia, </i>and <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
