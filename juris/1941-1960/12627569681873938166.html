				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Maria Morales was the registered owner of an agricultural&nbsp; land designated as Lot&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 724-C&nbsp; of&nbsp; the cadastral survey&nbsp; of&nbsp; Mabalacat,&nbsp; Pampanga.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Republic of the Philippines, at&nbsp; the&nbsp; request of the&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; Government and pursuant to the&nbsp; terms of the&nbsp; Military Bases Agreement of March&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1947,&nbsp; instituted condemnation proceedings in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Pampanga, docketed as Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 148, for the purpose of expropriating' the lands owned by Man a Morales and others needed for the expansion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clark&nbsp; Field&nbsp; Air&nbsp; Base, which, project is necessary for the mutual&nbsp; protection and defense of the Philippines and&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; Blas Gutierrez&nbsp; was also made&nbsp; a party defendant&nbsp; in said Civil Case&nbsp; No. 148 for being the&nbsp; husband&nbsp; of&nbsp; the landowner Maria&nbsp; Morales. At the&nbsp; commencement of the&nbsp; action, the Republic of the Philippines, therein plaintiff, deposited&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Clerk of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pampanga&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P156,960, which was&nbsp; provisionally fixed&nbsp; as the value of the lands sought&nbsp; to be&nbsp; expropriated,&nbsp; in order that&nbsp; it&nbsp; could take immediate possession of the same.<br><br>On January 27, 1949,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; order of the Court,&nbsp; the sum of P34,580 (PNB Check 721520-Exh. R)&nbsp; was paid by the Provincial Treasurer of Pampanga to Maria&nbsp; Morales out of the&nbsp; original deposit of&nbsp; P156,960&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; therein plaintiff.&nbsp; After due hearing, the Court of First Instance of Pampanga rendered decision dated November 29, 1949, wherein it fixed as just compensation P2,500&nbsp; per hectare for some of the lots and P3,000. per hectare for the others,&nbsp; which values were&nbsp; based on the reports of the&nbsp; Commission on Appraisal whose members were chosen by both parties and by the Court,&nbsp; which took into consideration the different conditions affecting the&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; condemned properties in&nbsp; making their findings. <br><br>In&nbsp; virtue of said decision, defendant Maria Morales was to receive the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; P94,305.75 as compensation for Lot No.&nbsp; 724-C&nbsp; which was one&nbsp; of the expropriated lands. But&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; disapproved defendants' claims for&nbsp; consequential damages considering them amply compensated by the price awarded to their&nbsp; said properties.&nbsp; In order to avoid further litigation expenses&nbsp; and&nbsp; delay&nbsp; inherent to an appeal, the parties entered into a compromise agreement on January 7,&nbsp; 1950, modifying&nbsp; in part the decision rendered by the Court in the sense of fixing the compensation&nbsp; for all the lands, without distinction, at P2,500&nbsp; per&nbsp; hectare, which compromise&nbsp; agreement was approved by the Court&nbsp; on January 9, 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; This reduction of the price to P2,500&nbsp; per hectare did not affect&nbsp; Lot No. 724-C of defendant&nbsp; Maria Morales.&nbsp; Sometime&nbsp; in 1950,&nbsp; the spouses Bias Gutierrez and Maria Morales received the sum of P59,785.75 representing the balance remaining in their favor after deducting&nbsp; the amount of P34,580 already withdrawn from the compensation&nbsp; due to&nbsp; them.<br><br>In&nbsp; a notice of assessment dated January 28, 1953,&nbsp; the Collector of Internal Revenue demanded of the petitioners the payment of P8,481 as alleged deficiency&nbsp; income tax for the year 1950, <i>inclusive</i> of surcharges and penalties.&nbsp; On March 5, 1958,&nbsp; counsel for petitioners&nbsp; sent a letter to the Collector&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; requesting&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; to withdraw&nbsp; . and&nbsp; reconsider&nbsp; said&nbsp; assessment,&nbsp;&nbsp; contending among others, that the compensation&nbsp; paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; spouses by the Government for their property was&nbsp; not&nbsp; "income derived from sale,&nbsp; dealing' or disposition of property"&nbsp; referred to by section 29 of the Tax Code and therefore not taxable; that even&nbsp; granting that&nbsp; condemnation of private properties is embraced within the&nbsp; meaning&nbsp; of the word "sale" or "dealing", the compensation received by&nbsp; the taxpayers must&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as income for 1948&nbsp; and not. for&nbsp; 1S50 since&nbsp; the amount deposited&nbsp; and paid&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1948 represented more than 25 per cent of the total compensation awarded by the court;&nbsp; that the assessment was made after the lapse of the 3â€”year prescriptive period provided for in section 51-(d)&nbsp; of the Tax Code;&nbsp; that the compensation in question should be exempted from taxation by reason of the provision of section 29&nbsp; (6)-6 of&nbsp; the Tax Code; that the spouses Bias Gutierrez and Maria&nbsp; Morales did not realize any&nbsp; profit in said transaction as there were improvements on the land already made and that&nbsp; the purchasing value of the peso at the time of the expropriation proceeding had&nbsp; depreciated if compared to the value&nbsp; of the pre-war peso; and that penalties should not be&nbsp; imposed on said spouses because granting&nbsp; that the assessment was correct, the omission of the compensation awarded therein was due to an honest mistake. <br>&nbsp;<br>This request was denied&nbsp; by the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal Revenue,&nbsp; in a letter dated April&nbsp; 26, 1954, refuting point by point the arguments advanced by the taxpayers.&nbsp; The record further shows that a warrant of distraint and levy was issued&nbsp; by. the&nbsp; Collector of Internal Revenue on&nbsp; the properties of&nbsp; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bias&nbsp; Gutierrez&nbsp; found&nbsp; in Mabalacat,&nbsp; Pampanga, and&nbsp; a notice of tax&nbsp; lien was&nbsp; duly registered with the Register&nbsp; of&nbsp; Deeds of San Fernando, Pampanga,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same&nbsp; date.&nbsp; Counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; spouses then&nbsp; requested that the matter&nbsp; be referred&nbsp; to the Conference Staff of the Bureau of Internal Revenue for proper hearing, to which the Collector answered&nbsp; in a letter dated December 24, 1954,&nbsp; stating&nbsp; that the&nbsp; request would&nbsp; be granted&nbsp; upon compliance by&nbsp; the&nbsp; taxpayers with&nbsp; the requirements of Department of Finance Order No. 213,&nbsp; i.e., the filing of a verified petition to that effect and&nbsp; that one half of the total assessment should&nbsp; be&nbsp; guaranteed by&nbsp; a bond,' provided that the taxpayers would agree in writing to&nbsp; the suspension&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; running" of&nbsp; the period&nbsp; of prescription. <br><br>The taxpayers then served notice that the case would be brought on appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals, which they did by filing a petition&nbsp; with&nbsp; said&nbsp; Court to&nbsp; review&nbsp; the assessment made by the Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue, docketed as C.T.A. Case No. 65.&nbsp; In that instance, it&nbsp; was prayed that the Court render judgment declaring that the taking of petitioners' land by the Government was not a sale or dealing in property; that the amount paid to petitioners as just compensation for their property should not be diminished by way of taxation; that said compensation was by law exempt from taxation and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; period to collect the income taxes&nbsp; by summary&nbsp; methods&nbsp; had prescribed ; that respondent Collector of Internal Revenue be enjoined from&nbsp; carrying"&nbsp; out further steps&nbsp; to collect from petitioners by summary methods the said taxes which they alleged to be&nbsp; erroneously&nbsp; assessed&nbsp; and for&nbsp; such other remedies which would serve the ends of law and justice.<br><br>The Solicitor General, in&nbsp; representation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of Internal&nbsp; Revenue, tiled&nbsp; an answer on February 11, 1955,&nbsp; admitting&nbsp; some&nbsp; of the&nbsp; allegations of petitioners and denying some of them,&nbsp; and&nbsp; as special defenses, he&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; the contention that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court had no jurisdiction&nbsp; to entertain&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; profit realized by petitioners from&nbsp; the sale of the land in question was subject to income tax; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; full&nbsp; compensation received by petitioners should be included in the income received in 1950, same having been paid&nbsp; in 1950 by the Government;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bases&nbsp; Agreement&nbsp; only residents of the United States 'are exempt from the&nbsp; payment of income tax in the Philippines in respects to profits derived under a contract with the&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; Government in connection with the construction, maintenance and operation of the bases;&nbsp; that&nbsp; in the&nbsp; determination&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; gain or&nbsp; loss from the sale&nbsp; of property acquired&nbsp; on&nbsp; or after March 1, 1913, the&nbsp; cost of acquisition&nbsp; and the&nbsp; selling price shall be taken&nbsp; into account without qualification&nbsp; as to the purchasing power of the currency; that the imposition of the&nbsp; 50 per cent surcharge&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the Tax&nbsp; Code; that the Collector&nbsp; of Internal Revenue was empowered to collect petitioners' deficiency&nbsp; income&nbsp; tax; and prayed&nbsp; that the petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; review&nbsp; be dismissed; petitioners be&nbsp; ordered to&nbsp; pay the amount of P8,481 plus the delinquency penalty of 5&nbsp; per cent for late payment and monthly interest at the&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of 1 per cent from April&nbsp; 1, 1953, up to the date of actual payment and for such other relief&nbsp; that may be deemed just&nbsp; and&nbsp; equitable&nbsp; in&nbsp; the premises.<br><br>After due hearing and after the&nbsp; parties had filed their respective memoranda, the Court&nbsp; of Tax&nbsp; Appeals rendered decision on August 31, 1955, holding&nbsp; that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine the&nbsp; case; that the&nbsp; gain derived by the petitioners from the expropriation of their property constituted taxable income and as such was capital gain; and that said gain was taxable in 1950&nbsp; when it was realized. It was also found by said Court that&nbsp; the evidence did not warrant the imposition&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 50 per cent surcharge because the petitioners acted in good faith and without intent to defraud the Government when they failed to include&nbsp; in their gross income the proceeds they received&nbsp; from the expropriated property,&nbsp; and,&nbsp; therefore, modified the assessment&nbsp; made&nbsp; by respondent,&nbsp; requiring petitioners&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay only the sum of P5,654,&nbsp; From this decision,&nbsp; both&nbsp; parties appealed to this Court and in this&nbsp; instance, petitioners Bias Gutierrez and Maria Morales,&nbsp; as appellants in G.&nbsp; R. No. L-9738, made the&nbsp; following assignments of error: <br><blockquote><ol><li> That the Court of Tax Appeals erred in holding that, for income tax purposes, income from expropriation should&nbsp; be deemed as income from sale, any profit&nbsp; derived therefrom is subject to income tax&nbsp; as capital gain pursuant to the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Section 37-(a)-(5) m relation to&nbsp; Section 29-(a)&nbsp; of' the Tax&nbsp; Code; <br><br></li><li> That the Court of Tax Appeals erred in not holding that, under the&nbsp; particular circumstances in which the property of the appellants was taken by the Philippine Government, the amount paid to&nbsp; them as just compensation is exempt from income tax pursuant to Section 29 (b)-(6)&nbsp; of the Tax&nbsp; Code; <br><br></li><li> That the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals erred&nbsp; in&nbsp; not holding&nbsp; that the respondent Collector is definitely barred&nbsp; by the Statute of Limitations from collecting the deficiency income tax in question, whether administratively thru summary methods, or judicially thru the&nbsp; ordinary court&nbsp; procedures; <br><br></li><li> That the Court of Tax Appeals erred in&nbsp; not holding&nbsp; that the capital gain found by the respondent Collector&nbsp; as have been derived by the petitioners-appellants from the expropriation of their&nbsp; property is merely nominal, not subject to income tax, and in&nbsp; not holding that the&nbsp; pronouncement of the&nbsp; court in the expropriation ease in&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; respect&nbsp; is&nbsp; binding upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Collector of&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue; and <br><br></li><li> That the Court of&nbsp; Tax Appeals erred in not pronouncing upon the&nbsp; pleadings of the&nbsp; parties that the petitioners-appellants did not derive&nbsp; any&nbsp; capital gain&nbsp; from&nbsp; the expropriation of&nbsp; their property. </li></ol></blockquote>The&nbsp; appeal of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal Revenue was&nbsp; docketed&nbsp; in this Court as G- R.&nbsp; No. L-9771, and in this case&nbsp; the Solicitor General ascribed to the lower court&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of the following error: <br><blockquote>That the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals erred in holding that respondents. are not subject&nbsp; to the&nbsp; payment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; 50&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent surcharge in spite of the fact that the latter's&nbsp; income tax return for&nbsp; the year 1950 is false and/or fraudulent. </blockquote>The facts just narrated are not disputed&nbsp; and the&nbsp; controversy only arose from the assertion by&nbsp; the Collector of Internal Revenue that&nbsp; petitioners-appellants&nbsp; failed to include&nbsp; from&nbsp; their gross income, in filing their income tax return for 1950, the amount of P94,305.75 which they had received as compensation&nbsp; for&nbsp; their&nbsp; land taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Government by expropriation&nbsp; proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the&nbsp; contention of respondent Collector of&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; that such transfer&nbsp; of property,&nbsp; for taxation purposes, is "sale" and that the&nbsp; income derived&nbsp; therefrom is&nbsp; taxable.&nbsp; The pertinent provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code applicable to the instant cases are the following: <br><blockquote>Sec.&nbsp; 29. Gross Income.â€”(a)&nbsp; General definition.â€”"Gross income" includes gains, profits, and income derived from&nbsp; salaries, wages, or compensation for personal service of whatever kind and in whatever form paid', or from professions, vocations, trades,&nbsp; businesses, commerce, <i>Rales or dealings in property, whether real or personal, growing out of ownership</i> or use&nbsp; of or interest&nbsp; in such property;&nbsp; also from interests, rents, dividends, securities, or the transactions of any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains, profits, and income derived from any source whatsoever. <br><br>Sec. 37. INCOME FROM SOURCES WITHIN THE PHILIPPINES.â€” <br><br>(a) Gross&nbsp;&nbsp; income&nbsp; from sources&nbsp; within the&nbsp; Philippines.â€”The following- items&nbsp; of gross income shall be treated&nbsp; as&nbsp; gross income from sources&nbsp; within the Philippines: <br><blockquote>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </blockquote>(5) SALE OF REAL: PROFERTY.â€” Gains, profits, and income from the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of real property located in&nbsp; the Philippines; <br><blockquote>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</blockquote></blockquote>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no question&nbsp; that the&nbsp; property expropriated being&nbsp; located&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Philippines, compensation&nbsp; or income derived therefrom ordinarily has to&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered as income from sources within the Philippines and subject to the&nbsp; taxing jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; However, it is to be remembered&nbsp; that said property&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquired by the&nbsp; Government through&nbsp; condemnation&nbsp; proceedings and appellants'&nbsp; stand&nbsp; is,&nbsp; therefore, that same&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; sale&nbsp; as&nbsp; said&nbsp; acquisition was&nbsp; by&nbsp; force,&nbsp; there being&nbsp; practically no&nbsp; meeting of&nbsp; the&nbsp; minds between&nbsp; the parties.&nbsp; Consequently, the taxpayers contend,&nbsp; this&nbsp; kind of transfer of ownership must&nbsp; perforce be distinguished from sale, for the purpose of Section 29-(a)&nbsp; of the Tax Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; the authorities in&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States on&nbsp; the matter&nbsp; sustain the&nbsp; view expressed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of Internal Revenue, for it is held&nbsp; that: <br><blockquote>"<i>The transfer of property through&nbsp; condemnation proceedings</i>&nbsp; is a sale or exchange within&nbsp; the meaning of section 117 (a) of the 1936 Revenue Act and <i>profit from the transaction constitutes capital gain"</i>(1942.&nbsp; Com. Int. Revenue us. Kiesclbach (CCA 3) VII F. (24) 359). "<i>The taking of property&nbsp; by&nbsp; condemnation and tile payment&nbsp; of pist compensation therefore is a 'sale' or 'exdiange'</i> within the meaning of section 117 (a)<i> of the Revenue Act of 1939, and profits from. tlhat transaction is capital gain"</i>&nbsp; (David R. Erown vs. Comm., 1942, 42 BTA 139). <br></blockquote>The proposition that&nbsp; income&nbsp; from&nbsp; expropriation proceedings is income from sales or exchange and&nbsp; therefore taxable has been likewise&nbsp; upheld in the&nbsp; case of Lapham vs. U.S.&nbsp; (1949, 40 AFTR&nbsp; 1370)&nbsp; and in&nbsp; Xneipp vs. U.S. (1849, 85&nbsp; F Suppl.&nbsp; 902).&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears&nbsp; then that the&nbsp; ac- quisition by the Government of private properties through the exercise of the power&nbsp; of eminent&nbsp; domain, <i>said properties being JUSTLY compensated</i>, is embraced within&nbsp; the meaning of the term "sale" or "disposition of property", and the proceeds&nbsp; from said transaction clearly fall&nbsp; within the definition of gross income laid down by Section 29 of the Tax Code of the&nbsp; Philippines.<br><br>Petitioners-appellants&nbsp; also&nbsp; averred that granting that the compensation thus received&nbsp; is "income",&nbsp; same&nbsp; is&nbsp; exempted under&nbsp; Section 29-(6)-6 of the&nbsp; Tax Code,&nbsp; which reads as follows: <br><blockquote>Sec. 29.&nbsp; GROSS INCOME.â€” <br><blockquote>(b) EXCLUSIONS FROM GROSS INCOME.â€”The following&nbsp; items shall not be included in gross&nbsp; income and shall be exempt from taxation under this Title: <br><br>(6) <i>Income exempt under treaty.</i>â€”Income&nbsp; of any&nbsp; kind,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the extent required by any&nbsp; treaty&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; binding upon the Govern- ment of the Philippines. </blockquote></blockquote>The taxpayers maintain that since,&nbsp; at the request of the&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; Government, the&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; to expropriate&nbsp; the land in question necessary for the expansion of the Clark Field Air&nbsp; Base- was&nbsp; instituted by the&nbsp; Philippine Govern- ment as part&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; obligation under&nbsp; the. Military&nbsp; Bases Agreement, the&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; accruing&nbsp; therefrom&nbsp; must necessarily fall&nbsp; under&nbsp; the exemption&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; by Section 29-(b)-6&nbsp; of the Tax&nbsp; Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; find this&nbsp; stand untenable,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; same Military&nbsp; Bases Agreement cited by&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; contains&nbsp; the&nbsp; following:<br><blockquote><center>"ARTICLE&nbsp; XXII <br>"CONDEMNATION OR EXPROPRIATION</center> <br>"1, Whenever it is&nbsp; necessary to acquire&nbsp; by condemnation&nbsp; or&nbsp; ex- propriation proceedings real property belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; private persons, association, or corporations located in bases&nbsp; named in Annex 'A' and Annex&nbsp; 'B' in order to carry cut the purposes of this agreement,&nbsp; the Philippines will institute and prosecute&nbsp; such condemnation proceedings m&nbsp; accordance with the laws of&nbsp; the Philippines.&nbsp; The United States&nbsp; agrees&nbsp; to&nbsp; reimburse the Philippines for&nbsp; all the&nbsp; reasonable expenses, damages, and costs thereby incurred, including&nbsp; the value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; property&nbsp; us determined by the Court.

Before&nbsp; that date&nbsp; (1950),&nbsp; appellant taxpayers were still the&nbsp; owners of their whole&nbsp; property that was&nbsp; subject of condemnation proceedings and said amount of P34,580 was not&nbsp; paid to, but&nbsp; merely <i>deposited</i> in court and&nbsp; <i>withdrawn</i> by them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; the <i>payment</i> of the value of Maria<br><br>Morales' Lot 724-C was actually made&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Republic of the Philippines in 1950 and it has to be credited as income for 1950 for it&nbsp; was then&nbsp; when title over said property passed to the Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; Appellant taxpayers&nbsp; cannot say&nbsp; that&nbsp; the title&nbsp; over the property&nbsp; expropriated already&nbsp; passed&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Government when&nbsp; the latter was placed in possession&nbsp; thereof, for in condemnation proceedings, title to the land&nbsp; does not pass to&nbsp; the plaintiff until the indemnity is&nbsp; paid&nbsp; (Calvo vs. Zandueta, 49&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 605),&nbsp; and&nbsp; notwithstanding possession acquired by&nbsp; the&nbsp; expropriator, title&nbsp; does&nbsp; not actually pass&nbsp; to him until payment of the&nbsp; amount adjudged by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court and the registration of the judgment&nbsp; with the Register of Deeds (See Visayan Refining&nbsp; Company vs. Camus et al., 40 Phil. 550; Metropolitan Water District vs. De los Angeles, 55 Phil.&nbsp; 788).&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if&nbsp; said&nbsp; amount&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been&nbsp; reported as income for 1950 in the&nbsp; return that&nbsp; must have been filed on or before&nbsp; March&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; the&nbsp; assessment made by the Collector&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; 1958, is still&nbsp; within the 3-year prescriptive period provided for&nbsp; by&nbsp; Section 51-d and could,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; be collected either&nbsp; by the&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; methods of&nbsp; distraint and levy or by judicial action&nbsp; (See Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Internal Revenue vs.&nbsp; A.P. Reyes et al.,&nbsp; 100 Phil., 822; Collector of Internal Revenue&nbsp; vs. Zulueta et al., 100 Phil.,&nbsp; 872; and Sambrano vs. Court of Tax Appeals et al.,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>,&nbsp; p. 1).<br><br>As to appellant taxpayers'&nbsp; proposition that the&nbsp; profit derived by them&nbsp; from&nbsp; the expropriation of their property is merely nominal and&nbsp; not&nbsp; subject to income tax, We find Section&nbsp; 85&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Code illuminating.&nbsp; Said&nbsp; section reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 35. DETERMINATION OF&nbsp; GAIN&nbsp; OR LOSS FROM THE&nbsp; SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION&nbsp; OF PROPERTY.â€”The gain derived or loss sustained from the&nbsp; sale or other disposition of property, real or personal, or mixed, shall be determined in accordance with the following schedule: <br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <br><br>"(b)&nbsp; In the case&nbsp; of property acquired <i>on or after</i> March&nbsp; first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, the coat thereof if such property was acquired by purchase or the&nbsp; fair&nbsp; market price or value&nbsp; as of the date of the&nbsp; acquisition&nbsp; if the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; by&nbsp; gratuitous title. </blockquote><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></blockquote>The records show that the property in question was adjudicated to Maria Morales by order of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Pampanga on&nbsp; March 28, 1929, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with the aforequoted&nbsp; section of the National Internal Revenue Code, only the fair market price or value of the property&nbsp; as of the date of the acquisition&nbsp; thereof should be considered in determining the gain or loss sustained by the property owner when the property was disposed, without taking&nbsp; into account the purchasing power of the currency&nbsp; used&nbsp; in&nbsp; the transaction.&nbsp; The records placed&nbsp; the value of the said property at the&nbsp; time of its acquisition by&nbsp;&nbsp; appellant&nbsp;&nbsp; Maria&nbsp;&nbsp; Morales&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; P28,291.73&nbsp;&nbsp; and it is a fact that same&nbsp; was compensated with&nbsp; P94,305.75 when it was&nbsp; expropriated.&nbsp; The&nbsp; resulting&nbsp; difference&nbsp; is surely a capital gain and should be correspondingly taxed. <br><br>As to the only question&nbsp; raised by appellant Collector of Internal Revenue&nbsp; in&nbsp; case L-9771, assailing&nbsp; the lower Court's order exonerating petitioners from the 50 per cent surcharge&nbsp; imposed on the&nbsp; latter, on the ground that the taxpayers'&nbsp; income tax&nbsp; return for 1950&nbsp; is&nbsp; false&nbsp; and/or fraudulent, it should be noted that the&nbsp; Court of Tax Appeals found that the evidence did not warrant the imposition of&nbsp; said&nbsp; surcharge because the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; therein acted&nbsp; in good faith and&nbsp; without&nbsp; intent to&nbsp; defraud&nbsp; the Government.<br><blockquote>"<i>The question of fraud is&nbsp; a question of fact </i> "which frequently requires a nicely balanced judgment to&nbsp; answer.&nbsp; All the facts and eircumstamces&nbsp; surrounding the&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; of the taxpayer's&nbsp; business and all the facts incident to the preparation of the alleged fraudvjlent return should&nbsp; be considered".&nbsp; (Mertens, Federal&nbsp; Income Taxation, Chapter BB).</blockquote> The question of&nbsp; fraud being a question of fact and the lower&nbsp; court having made&nbsp; the finding that&nbsp; "the evidence of this case&nbsp; does&nbsp; not warrant the imposition&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 50 per cent&nbsp; surcharge",&nbsp; We are constrained&nbsp; to&nbsp; refrain from giving&nbsp; any&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; question raised&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Solicitor General,&nbsp; for it is already settled&nbsp; in&nbsp; this jurisdiction that in passing upon petitions to review decisions of the Court of Tax&nbsp; Appeals, We have to confine ourselves to questions of law. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision appealed from&nbsp; by both parties is hereby, affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; It is so&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
