<p>"El Juzgado, POR TANTO, aprueba el mencionado convenio, y dicta sentencia

<p>(Annex A, p. 9, Roll).</p>
<p>This decision having become final, the corresponding wttt of execution was 
issued on July 11, 1953. Owing, seemingly, to request of defendant be Guzman, 
who had, meanwhile, made partial payments on account of the sum due under the 
decision, plaintiff Yaldua allowed said writ to lapse. On February 4, 1954, the 
court issued an alias writ of execution, which was delivered to the sheriff on 
February 24 of the same year. Pursuant thereto, on April 13, 1954, the Sheriff 
of Manila levied upon the following personal properties of De Guzman, located in 
his residence, at No. 693 Makiling St., Sampaloc, Manila:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1-Sofa de madera 'Dao' con celujia de bejuco;<br>"l-Mesita de madera 'Dao' 
con cristal;<br>"4-Butacas de madera 'Dao' con celujia de bejuco;<br>"1-Piano 
marca 'P.S. Wick' con su banquito redondo;<br>"1-Refrigirator marca 
'SHELVADOR';<br>"1-Estante de madera con cristal;<br>"1-Aparador platera de 
'Dao' con espejo y cajonitos;<br>"1-Radio de combinacion 
(Cabinet);<br>"2-Espejos de pared, desiguales;<br>"1-Mesa para coniffidor de 
madera con cristal; y<br>"8-Sillas para comedor de madera con asiento de 
bejuco." Petition, p.2.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The next day, said officer issued a notice to the effect that these 
properties would be sold at public auction on April 22, 1954,at 10:00 a.m. about 
thirty (30) minutes before the time scheduled for the auction sale, petitioner 
herein, Servando R. Lara, filed, with the Sheriff of Manila, a verified third 
party claim alleging that said properties were subject to a chattel mortgage 
constituted, in his favor, by De Guzman, by virtue of a deed, copy of which was 
attached to said third party claim, dated December 12, 1952, and registered with 
the office of the register of deeds for the City of Manila. Said deed of chattel 
mortgage states that the same was executed to guarantee the .payment of a debt 
of P5,000. on or before June 12, 1953, with interest thereon at the rate of 12% 
per annum, to be computed and paid, upon maturity, simultaneously with the 
capital. On or about April 26, 1954 Yaldua filed an "urgent motion to quash 
third party claim and/or to determine the valnie of the levied propertyos for 
purposes of filing a bond." Despite the opposition of Lara thereto, the court 
issued, on May 13, 1954,' the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"O R D E R</p>
<p>"After a rareful consideration of the urgent motion filed on April 27, 1954, 
and for the reasons stated therein, this court believes and so holds that the 
same is well taken;</p>
<p>"AS PRAYED FOR, the third party claim filed by one, Servando R. Lara is 
hereby quashed, and the Sheriff of the City of Manila is hereby ordered to 
proceed with the sale of the personal properties of the defendant for the 
satisfaction of the deficiency of the judgment datee March 20, 1954, rendered 
against the defendant in the above-entitled case.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED." (Annex F, p.21, Roll).</p></blockquote>
<p>Two motions for reconsideration of this order having been denied, the last by 
Hon. Froilan Bayona, Judge, the third party claimant., Servando R. Lara, 
instituted the present case, against said Judge, and the Sheriff of Manila, 
Concepcion Yaldua ana Prudencio de Guzman. In the petition, it is prayed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x that a writ of preliminary injunction be forthwith issued against the 
sheriff of Manila to suspend the sale on July 7, 1954 upon filing the necessary 
bond, and that, after due hearing, a decision be rendered declaring the 
aforesaid orders and actuations of Judge Julio Villanor and the respondent Judge 
Froilan Bayona, null and void; that the preliminary injunction be made permament 
and perpetual; and that a writ of prohibition be issued against said respondent 
judge, prohibiting him from issuing another similar order of execution against 
the same properties previously levied upon and finally to order the Sheriff to 
discharge said properties from levy and to deliver the possession thereof to the 
petitioner." (Petition, p. 7, loll.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Soon after the filing of the aforementioned petition, we issued the writ of 
preliminary injunction therein prayed for, upon ,the filing of the corresponding 
bond.</p>
<p>Petitioner contends that the lower court has no jurisdiction to quash his 
third party claim, for: the same was filed, not in court, but with the Sheriff 
of Manila; petitioner is not a party in the case; and the validity of the third 
party claim and the rights of the third party claimant should be determined in a 
separate and independent action.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, aside from maintaining that respondent Judge had full 
authority to issue the order complained of, respondents point out a number of 
circumstances tending to suggest that the chattel mortgage and the debt it 
purports to guarantee are fictitious in nature. It is not necessary, however, 
that the point last adverted to be determined or evesrconsidered. For the 
purpose of this decision, we will assume that said debt and chattel mortgage are 
legitimate, at least, as between the mortgagor and the mortgagee.</p>
<p>It appears that, although dated December 12, 1952, the deed of chattel 
mortgage in favoe of petitioner Lara was not filed with the office of the 
register of deeds until April 22, 1954, at 9:00 a.m., or one (1) hour before the 
time set for the sale at public auction of the properties: in question, and over 
nine (9) days <u>after</u> the levy made by the sheriff, in compliance with the 
<u>alias</u> writ of execution aforementioned. Section 4 of Act No. 1508, 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A chattel mortgage shall not be valid against any person except the 
mortgagor, his executors or administrators, unless the possession of the 
property is delivered to and retained by the mortgagee or unless the mortgage is 
recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the province in which the 
mortgagor resides at the time of making the same, or if he resides without the 
Philippine Islands, in the province in which the property is situated: x x x." 
(Underscoring supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmush as, at the time of the levy, on April 13, 1954, the mortgagee was 
not in possession of the property in dispute and the deed of mortgage was not 
registered in the manner provided by law, it is obvious that petitioner's 
chattel mortgage is not valid as against either the judgment creditor or the 
court. Anyhow, even if said deed had been registered prior to tho levy by the 
sheriff, a sale of said properties in pursuance of the aforementioned writ of 
execution could not affect the rights -if any- of the alleged mortgagee, for 
"such sale conveys to the purchaser all the rights which the debtor had in such 
property on the day the execution or attachment was levied." (Rule 39, section 
22, Rules of Court). In other words, the buyer acquires the propperty subject to 
such liens or encumbrances as existed thereon at the time of the execution or 
attachment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sheriff is an officer of the court. He acted as such when he 
received petitioner's third. party claim. To put it differently, insofar as 
necessary for the exercise of the "inherent" power of the court "to control, in 
furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers" (Rule 124, 
section 5[d] . Rules of Court) and "to do all things reasonably necessary for 
the administration of justice," (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Revised 
Edition [1952] Vol. III, p. 642) said third party claim may be considered as 
filed with the court itself.</p>
<p>Again, in the case of Planas <em>vs</em>. Madrigal (L-6570, decided April 12, 
1954), we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The question to be determined is whether the respondent Judge acted with 
grave abuse of discretion when he ordered the quashing and discarding of the 
first and second third party claims interposed by petitioners on January 28, 
1953, and February 9, 1953, and in ordering petitioner Juan Planas to vacate the 
land of the plaintiff not being a party to the case of forcible entry and 
detainer instituted by Madrigal and Co. Inc., against Concepcion L. Planas and 
Illuminado L. Planas.</p>
<p>"The duty of the sheriff in connection with the execution and satisfaction of 
a judgment of the court is governed by Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, With 
regard to the proceedings to be followed where the property levied in execution 
is claimed by a third person, section 15 provides that if such person makes an 
affidavit of his title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the 
grounds of such right or title, and serves the same upon the offacer making the 
levy, the officer shall not be, bound to keep the property unless the judgment 
creditor, on demand, indemnify the officer against such claim by a bond in a sum 
not greater than the value of the property levied on. If the third party claim 
is sufficient, the sheriff, upon receiving it, is not bound to proceed with the 
lexry of the property, unless he is given by the judgment creditor an indemnity 
bond against the claim (Manga-ang <em>v</em>. The Provincial Sheriff, L-4869, 
May 26, 1952). Of course, <u>the sheriff may proceed with the levy even without 
the indemnity bond</u>, but in such case he will answer for any damages with his 
own personal funds. (Waite v. Peterson, et al., 8 Phil. 449; Alzua, et al. V. 
Johnson 21 Phil. 308; Consulta No. 441 de los abogados do Smith, Bell &amp; Co., 
46 Phil. 565.) And the rule also provides that nothing therein contained, shall 
prevent a third person from vindicating his claim to the property by any proper 
action (Section 15, Rule 39). </p>
<p>"In the present case, the provincial sheriff departed from ths regular 
procedure prescribed by the rules. He chose to proceed with the levy even 
without the indemnity bond in view of the urgent motion to quash filed by the 
judgment creditor in the main case. It should be remembered that the court, 
after proper hearings, wherein the parties were allowed to submit documentary 
evidence,found the third party claims to be without merit and ordered that they 
be discarded and <u>quashed</u>. Indeed, the court found that Juan Planas, the 
third party claimant, is the son of defendants Concepcion L. Planas and 
Illuminado L. Planas, and a stockholder of a firm of which Concepcion L. Planas 
was the pricipal stockholder. It also found : that since the filing of the 
ejectment case against the spouses Planas up to December 29, 1952, the four 
houses claimed by Juan Planas were registered in the name of his mother, 
Concepcion L. Planas, in the assessment rolls of Pasay City, and that it was 
only on said date that said assessments were transferred to Juan Planas. On the 
other hc.nd, the answer submitted by spouses Planas in the ejectment case 
eontains a clear averment that the four houses now in dispute were constructed 
and were the property of said spouses. Likewise, the latter of Atty. Arcadio 
Ejercito, counsel of Concepcion L. Planas, sent to the provincial sheriff in 
connection with the demolition of the four buildings in question, contains an 
avemment which indicates that said buildings belonged to said defendants. This 
circumstantial evidence must have engendered in the mind of the court the 
conviction that the claim of ownership put up by Juan Planas at so late an hour 
is hit an eleventh hour attempt to thwart and frustrate the execution of the 
judgment rendered in the ejectment case.</p>
<p>"<u>We hold that the action taken by the respondent Judge on this matter is 
justified</u>. At any rate, the right of Juan Planas to the property is not 
completely lost, for the rule reserves to him the right to vindicate his claim 
in a proper action (Section 15, Rule 39). (Underscoring 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>At any rate, Rule 39, section 15 of the Rules of Court reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If property levied on be claimed by any other person than the defendant or 
his agent, and such person make an affidavit of his title thereto or right to 
the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and serve 
the same upon the officer making the levy, and a copy thereof upon the judgment 
creditor, the officer shall not be bound to keep the property, unless such 
judgment creditor of his agent, on demand, indemnify the officer against such 
claim by a bond in a sum not greater than the value of the property levied on, 
and, in case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be determined by 
the court issuing the writ of execution, The officer is not liable for damages, 
for the taking or keeping of such property, to any such third person unless such 
claim is made and unless the action for damages be brought within one hundred 
twenty days from the date of the filing of the bond. But nothing herein 
contained shall prevent such third person from vindicating his claim to the 
property by any proper action. When, however, the plaintiff, or the person in 
whose favor the writ of execution runs, is the Republic of the Philippines, or 
any officer duly representing it, the filing of such bond shall not be required, 
and in case the sheriff or attaching officer is sued for damages as a result of 
the attachment, he shall be Represented by the Solicitor-General and if held 
liable therefore, the actual damages adjudged by the court shall be paid by the 
Insular Treasurer out of such funds as may be appropriated for the 
purpose."</p></blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to this provision, nothing contained therein shall prevent 
petitioner "from vindicating his claim to the property by any proper action," 
Neither does the order complained of deprive petitioner herein of the 
opportunity to enforce his alleged rights by appropriate proceedings. In short, 
he has another "Plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of 
law," and, hence is not entitled either to a writ of certiorari or to a writ of 
prohibition, (Rule 67, sections 1 and 2, Rules of Court).</p>
<p>Petitioner alleges that having taken place on April 13, 1954, or more than 60 
days from the issuance of the <u>alias</u> writ of execution, on February 4, 
1954, the levy in question is null and void. Although the lifetime of a writ of 
execution is 60 days, this period should be computed, pursuant to Rule 39, 
section 11, of the Rules of Court, not from the <u>issuance</u> of said writ, 
but from its <u>receipt</u> by the sheriff. Said receipt, in the case at bar, 
took place on February. 24, 1954. It is obvious, therefore, that said period of 
60 days had not expired when the levy was made on April 13, 1954.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is hereby denied, and the writ of preliminary 
injunction heretofore issued dissolved, with costs against the petitioner. </p>
<p>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, Bautista Angelo</em>, and 
<em>Labrador, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
