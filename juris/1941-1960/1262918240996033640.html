No. 995), which&nbsp; was&nbsp; terminated by&nbsp; an agreement&nbsp; entered into by the heirs on 30 December 1922 that partitioned the properties&nbsp; of the state among them (Exhibit C).&nbsp; The project of partition signed by them was submitted&nbsp; to, and approved by,&nbsp; the&nbsp; probate&nbsp; court.&nbsp; Among the properties adjudicated&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; widow&nbsp;&nbsp; (second&nbsp; spouse)&nbsp; Fernanda&nbsp; Manzanilla was a parcel of sugar cane land&nbsp; situated at barrio La Rioja, Patnongon,&nbsp; Antique,&nbsp; containing an area&nbsp; of 27,980 sq. m. more or&nbsp; less (Exhibit C-3) described&nbsp; in paragraph 3 of the plaintiffs'&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 26 March 1940 Fernanda Manzanilla sold the&nbsp; aforesaid&nbsp; parcel of land to Telesforo de la Cruz (Exhibit 3).&nbsp; On 15 October 1945 Fernanda Manzanilla died&nbsp; (Exhibit D).&nbsp; On 27 December 1951 Telesforo&nbsp; de la Cruz sold the&nbsp; same parcel of land by way of <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>&nbsp; to Felix Busayong (Exhibit 2) and on 30&nbsp; March 1954 he&nbsp; repurchased&nbsp; it.<br><br>On 1 October&nbsp; 1955 the four children of&nbsp; Silvestre&nbsp; de la Cruz,&nbsp; the last joined&nbsp; by her husband Jose B.&nbsp; Barcelo, brought&nbsp; an&nbsp; action&nbsp; against Telesforo de la&nbsp; Cruz in the Court of First Instance of Antique to recover&nbsp; possession and ownership of the parcel of land sold to him by&nbsp; their step-mother&nbsp; and mother on the ground&nbsp; that the vendor being&nbsp; a mere usufructuary thereof, the&nbsp; vendee's&nbsp; right thereto terminated upon the vendor's death on 15 October 1945.&nbsp; They also prayed&nbsp; that the defendant be&nbsp; ordered to pay them the same&nbsp; of P2,350, the amount they would have realized from&nbsp; the sale of the share in the&nbsp; produce of the land&nbsp; from 1946 to the date of the filing of the complaint, P5,700 as moral and&nbsp; exemplary damages, and P600 as attorney's fee; and to return to&nbsp; them the excess of the principal&nbsp; and interest of the consideration m the contract&nbsp; (Exhibit 3), as provided for in&nbsp; the Usury&nbsp; Law. They further prayed for other just and equitable relief.<br><br>The defendant&nbsp; moved to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint on the ground&nbsp; that their cause of action is&nbsp; barred by the statute of limitations.&nbsp; After the denial by the Court of his motion to&nbsp; dismiss,&nbsp; the defendant answered the&nbsp; complaint pleading that the plaintiffs have no cause of action against him because he&nbsp; acquired the&nbsp; parcel of&nbsp; land in question&nbsp; by way&nbsp; of&nbsp; absolute sale and for a valuable consideration on 26&nbsp; March 1940, from Fernanda Manzanilla, the plaintiffs' step-mother and mother, she being the owner thereof;&nbsp; that since then&nbsp; he has&nbsp; been in&nbsp; actual,&nbsp; open, public, peaceful, continuous and adverse possession under a claim of ownership;&nbsp; and that for that reason he has acquired&nbsp; title thereto by prescription.&nbsp; Claiming&nbsp; that as a result of the plaintiffs' frivolous claim he has suffered moral damages, the defendant prayed that the plaintiffs be ordered to pay him P10,000 as moral damages,&nbsp; P500 as attorney's fee, and the costs of the suit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiffs controverted his&nbsp; counterclaim.<br><br>After&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the Court rendered judgment holding that Fernanda Manzanilla,&nbsp; as owner of the parcel of&nbsp; land in question, having&nbsp; conveyed&nbsp; it unto the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; by way of absolute sale on 26&nbsp; March 1940, and the latter having been in possession thereof since then as owner, the defendant has&nbsp; acquired title thereto&nbsp; by prescription; dismissing the plaintiff's complaint; and ordering the plaintiffs to pay the defendant&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P124.09 as actual and moral damages&nbsp; and the costs of the suit.&nbsp; The plaintiffs&nbsp; have appealed to this Court on purely questions of law.<br><br>The trial court found that the appellee—<br><blockquote> *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; purchased&nbsp; the property&nbsp; from Fernanda&nbsp; Manzanilla on March 26, 1940&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; 3). Since that time&nbsp; up&nbsp; to the filing of the complaint on&nbsp; October 1, 1955, the plaintiff possessed&nbsp; the&nbsp; land through his tenants, received the produce thereof» paid&nbsp; the&nbsp; taxes of&nbsp; the property, and assessed&nbsp; it in his name.&nbsp; On December 27, 1951, the property was sold a <span style="font-style: italic;">retro </span>to Felix&nbsp; Busayong by the defendant and the land remained&nbsp; in the possession of Felix Busayong until it was redeemed by the defendant on March 30, 1954 (Exhibit 2).&nbsp; From the&nbsp; time the&nbsp; property&nbsp; was&nbsp; redeemed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant repossessed the land up to the present time.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.<br><br>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; There is abundant evidence that since the property was sold by the late&nbsp; Fernanda Manzanilla to the defendant the latter has possessed the land in the concept of an owner.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *.<br></blockquote>and&nbsp; held that—<br><blockquote>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; Section 41&nbsp; of the Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure&nbsp; which was then the law in force at the time the sale was made makes no distinction as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; manner the possession has commenced.&nbsp; In other words, a person who possessed a land&nbsp; for&nbsp; ten years&nbsp; continuously,&nbsp; publicly and in the concept of an owner acquired the land&nbsp; by prescription even though he has no title&nbsp; to the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; This Section 41 of Act No.&nbsp; 190 states partly as follows:<br><br>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; In whatever way the&nbsp; possession may have commenced or continued."<br><br>Plaintiffs' claim that the defendant has only acquired whatever right the&nbsp; late Fernanda Manzanilla has on the land is&nbsp; belied by the deed of sale that the&nbsp; late&nbsp; Fernanda Manzanilla has&nbsp; executed fa favor of the defendant.&nbsp; Beading attentively the deed of sale, Exhibit 3,&nbsp; it appears that Fernanda Manzanilla maintained to be the owner&nbsp; of the property that she has sold.&nbsp; The deed recites in part:<br><br>*****&nbsp; to that parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land&nbsp; of my absolute&nbsp; ownership which&nbsp; it was acquired by us during the life of my deceased husband&nbsp; *&nbsp; *<br></blockquote>and— <br><blockquote>* *&nbsp; * that the&nbsp; defendant has possessed the&nbsp; property in litigation for a period&nbsp; sufficient to acquire it by prescription, whatever right the plaintiffs might have over the&nbsp; property has long prescribed at the time the action was instituted.<br></blockquote>The appellee's possession of the parcel of land having been actual, open, public, peaceful and continuous under a claim of title exclusive&nbsp; of any other right&nbsp; and adverse to&nbsp; all claimants,&nbsp; since&nbsp; 26&nbsp; March 1940,&nbsp; he&nbsp; has&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; title thereto.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J. Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Endencia,</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
