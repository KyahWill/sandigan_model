				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari to annul&nbsp; an&nbsp; order of execution.<br><br>It appears that on June 17, 1948, Nicolas Miras brought an action in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Quezon for the recovery&nbsp; of a&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land, the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; as later amended,&nbsp; alleging that the&nbsp; said land had&nbsp; been conveyed by him by way of mortgage to defendants'&nbsp; predecessor-in-interest and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; withholding it from him&nbsp; by refusing to. allow him to redeem&nbsp; the mortgage.&nbsp; Answering the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; alleged that the conveyance&nbsp; of the land to their&nbsp; predecessor-in-interest was by way&nbsp; of sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto&nbsp; de&nbsp; retro</span> and that the&nbsp; period for&nbsp; redemption&nbsp; had&nbsp; already expired.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trial, the&nbsp; court found for plaintiff, declaring the contract between plaintiff and&nbsp; defendants'&nbsp; predecessor-in-interest to be one&nbsp; of mortgage with usurious interest and therefore null and void, and ordering the defendants to deliver&nbsp; of the land to plaintiff and to pay him the value of the products gathered from the land amounting to P9,670.00, to return the usurious interest paid&nbsp; and to pay the costs. The defendants took steps&nbsp; to appeal&nbsp; but before appeal could be perfected,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; moved&nbsp; for&nbsp; the execution of that part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; judgment which&nbsp; required the&nbsp; delivery of the land&nbsp; to him,&nbsp; alleging that,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; his&nbsp; best information&nbsp; and belief, the&nbsp; defendants were&nbsp; "not solvent enough to meet the&nbsp; damages awarded&nbsp; * * *&nbsp;&nbsp; and those that would accrue during&nbsp; the&nbsp; pendency of the&nbsp; appeal." Defendants objected to the motion for execution, denying that they&nbsp; were insolvent&nbsp; and alleging&nbsp; that their appeal was meritorious and that they&nbsp; had&nbsp; properties to answer for the&nbsp; damages&nbsp; that might finally be adjudged.&nbsp;&nbsp; But notwithstanding this opposition,&nbsp; the court rendered an order granting the motion for execution without specifying any&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; therefor.&nbsp; Reconsideration of the' order having been&nbsp; denied, the defendants&nbsp; brought the case&nbsp; here on certiorari&nbsp; to have the order annulled.<br><br>Section 2 of Rule 39 provides that "before&nbsp; the expiration of the time to&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; execution&nbsp; may issue, in&nbsp; the discretion of the court, on motion of the prevailing party with notice to the adverse party, upon good reasons to be stated in a&nbsp; special order."&nbsp; While&nbsp; this provision gives the court discretion to order&nbsp; execution while an&nbsp; appeal is being perfected, ;it at the same&nbsp; time requires that there be&nbsp; good&nbsp; reasons for the&nbsp; court's action and&nbsp; that those reasons be stated&nbsp; in a&nbsp; special order.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court's special order in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case specifies no reason.&nbsp; And while it is held that statement of&nbsp; the reasons by reference is sufficient, as&nbsp; when those&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; appear in&nbsp; the motion for execution and&nbsp; reference thereto is made in the special order as&nbsp; grounds&nbsp; therefor&nbsp; (Moran's Comments&nbsp; on&nbsp; the Rules of Court, Vol.&nbsp; I,&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; ed., pp. 792-793), the order complained of makes no reference to the reasons alleged by the movant as&nbsp; grounds for immediate execution. <br><br>As stated, the Rules give&nbsp; the court discretion to order execution pending&nbsp; appeal But&nbsp; that discretion must&nbsp; be sound discretion, which must&nbsp; grant such execution only where there are good reasons therefor,&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; to be&nbsp; stated in a&nbsp; special order as&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; required&nbsp; in the Rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compliance with that requirement is important, because unless&nbsp; the reasons for&nbsp; the special&nbsp; order&nbsp; be made&nbsp; known, it would be&nbsp; hard to&nbsp; determine whether judicial discretion has been properly exercised&nbsp; in the case. The requirement is not to be dispensed With just because the special order for execution also permits a .stay&nbsp; upon sufficient, bond. <br><br>In the present case, even were we to suppose that the lower court&nbsp; ordered immediate execution on the strength of the allegation contained&nbsp; in the&nbsp; motion for execution that the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; "not&nbsp; solvent enough," the order would still be without sufficient basis because&nbsp; the allegation, of insolvency—which is&nbsp; not under oath—is denied by the defendants and is not supported by proof. The respondent suggests&nbsp; that the lower court might have taken into account the argument made at&nbsp; the, hearing of the motion for execution that the appeal taken in the case was only for&nbsp; purposes of delay.&nbsp;&nbsp; But whether the court did or&nbsp; did not take that&nbsp; argument into account, the fact remains that the order is silent on&nbsp; the&nbsp; point, and; anyway,&nbsp; there is not&nbsp; enough showing that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal taken by the defendants was only&nbsp; a dilatory&nbsp; move.<br><br>The order&nbsp; complained of being clearly contrary to section 2, Rule&nbsp; 39, the petition for&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; is&nbsp; granted and&nbsp; the&nbsp; order complained of annulled and set aside,, the preliminary&nbsp; injunction heretofore issued being made permanent.&nbsp; Without special pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
