</style><div align="justify">Bruno Unay and his brother Godofredo Unay jointly charged with murder before 
the Court of First Instance of Samar and, after trial, Bruno was found guilty 
and sentenced to suffer <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, with the accessories 
of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P2,000, and 
to pay one-half of the costs. Godofredo was acquitted for lack of sufficient 
evidence. This appeal only concerns Bruno Unay.
<p>In the morning of February 15, 1951, at about 8:00 o'clock, Vivencio Candan, 
together with three companions, namely, namely, Eutiquio Gallenera, Conrado 
Izquerdo and Leoncio Quilicol, went to his land in sitio Babawang, Mondragon, 
Samar to make <u>caingin</u>. While they were thus working, Caadan saw Bruno 
Unay in a squatting position point ????? to the group, and besides him, his 
brother Godofredo holding an unsheathed bolo. As Caadan started to run he heard 
an explosion as a result of which Quilicol fell to the ground and died 
instantly. In the ensuing commotion, Caadan and his companions scampered for 
safety with the exception of Quilicol who fell dead. Eutiquio Gallenera also saw 
Bruno aiming his gun at the group for which reason he hid behind the trunk of a 
dead tree and from there he saw Bruno and his brother fleeing. Caadan and his 
two surviving companions proceeded to the <u>poblacion</u> where they reported 
the incident to the local authorities. In the afternoon of the same day, the 
chief of police and some constabulary soldiers repaired to the place to 
investigate. As an aftermath, the present charge was filed. The autopsy of the 
deceased showed that he sustained a gun shot wound, the bullet entering the left 
shoulder at the back below the neck and making its exit at the right side of the 
throat below the lower jaw, and that the cause of death was shock and 
hemorrhage.</p>
<p>The shooting appears to have been an offshoot of a dispute between Bruno Unay 
and Vivencio Caadan over the ownership of the land which was then worked and 
cleared by the latter on the date of the crime. Caadan testified that ten days 
before the shooting Bruno Unay went to house and warned him that he would shoot 
him and his men if they worked the disputed land.</p>
<p>Appellant set up the defense of alibi. He testified that in the night of 
February 14, 1951 he slept in the house of his sister Teodosia in the 
<u>poblacion</u> of Mondragon, Samar; that in the following morning , between 7 
and 8 o'clock, he went to the house of Mayor Rufo Deguia to ask for advice 
regarding a case of theft he lodged against Vivencio Caadan with the justice of 
the peace sometime in December, 1950; that the mayor gave the opinion that the 
action he should take is civil as suggested by the justice of the peace; that 
thereafter he went to the house one Alberto Cisneros where he took his breakfast 
and indulged in little drinking that Cisneros invited him that same morning to 
the house of his mother-in-law to take part in the celebration of her death 
anniversary where he took his lunch and was asked to deliver a brief speech; 
that thereafter he proceeded to a house of another sister, named Lucia, also in 
the town of Mondragon and did not leave the house until 2:30 o'clock in the 
afternoon.</p>
<p>This defense cannot be sustained in the light of the positive identification 
made of appellant by Vivencio Caadan and Eutiquio Gallenera who actually saw him 
aim his carbine and cause the explosion which resulted in the death of Leoncio 
Quilicol. That he acted in this manner is not strange considering the dispute 
that existed between him and Vivencio Caadan relative to the ownership of the 
land which was worked on by the latter and his companions. It was shown that ten 
days before the tragic event appellant went to the house of Caadan to warn him 
that he would shoot him and his men if they worked the land, and this 
controversy is admitted by appellant himself in his testimony. It may be that 
appellant, to make good his threat, aimed at his gun at Caadan but unfortunately 
the one hit was Quilicol. This circumstance however cannot alter the nature of 
his liability.</p>
<p>Another reason why this alibi cannot be sustained is its inherent 
incredibility, for if his purpose in going to the house of Mayor Rufo Deguia in 
the morning of the incident is merely to consult him regarding the case of theft 
he lodged against Caadan with the justice of the peace in December, 1950 it is 
strange that he had to do it precisely in the same morning, or after the lapse 
of nearly two months. Moreover, the house of Mayor Deguia was only about 3-1/2 
kilometers away from the place of the crime which, even if the alleged 
consultation is true, could not have prevented him from committing the crime as 
claimed by the prosecution. It further appears that Alberto Cisneros, who was 
presented to support the alibi, is an ex-convict who served a long prison term 
for looting, a circumstance which detracts much from the value of his 
testimony.</p>
<p>An attempt was made to discredit the testimony of the two witnesses for the 
prosecution, Vivencio Caadan and Eutiquio Gallenera, because of certain alleged 
discrepancies between their testimony in court and the version they gave of the 
shooting in their affidavits Exhibits 1 and 2, but these discrepancies are more 
apparent than real for they do not destroy the fact that is was Bruno Unay who 
was seen by them having a carbine in his hand immediately after the explosion. 
Whether he was actually seen in the act of shooting or thereafter would appear 
to be immaterial.</p>
<p>As regards the claim of one Roman Lagrimas that ten minutes after the 
shooting Caadan and Gallenera told him that they did not know who shot the 
deceased, it appears that the same was denied by both Caadan and Gallenera, 
aside from the fact that, being relative by affinity of appellant, according to 
his own admission, Lagrimas may have been merely impelled to say so by a desire 
to save him from liability.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from, being in accordance with law and the evidence, is 
hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
