				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 15, 1964,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Artemio&nbsp; G.&nbsp; Barron filed an application with the&nbsp; Public Service Commission for a certificate of public convenience to&nbsp; operate an exclusive ferry service between Calapan, Oriental Mindoro and&nbsp; Batangas, Batangas&nbsp; and vice&nbsp; versa, and between the same municipalities but via the town of Lobo, Batangas, which applications&nbsp; was&nbsp; amended&nbsp; on January 20, 1954.<br><br>On&nbsp; February&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; Elpidio&nbsp; Javellana, Marcelo Cruz, and Januario Jalandonl&nbsp; (motorboat service operators on the same lines) filed&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to dismiss the petition on the ground that&nbsp; the Commission had no jurisdiction to act upon&nbsp; and grant the&nbsp; application&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reason that the&nbsp; motorboat service between the points above referred to was not a ferry service but was in reality coastwise&nbsp; trade falling within the&nbsp; jurisdiction of the Bureau of&nbsp; Customs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion for dismissal was denied&nbsp; and thereafter the Commission proceeded&nbsp; to hear&nbsp; the&nbsp; case up to September 8,&nbsp; 1954, at which time only the applicant&nbsp; had presented evidence that&nbsp; the service&nbsp; applied&nbsp; for would promote, public convenience&nbsp; and necessity in a proper&nbsp; and suitable&nbsp; manner,&nbsp; and oppositors-petitioners had&nbsp; not&nbsp; yet begun presenting their evidence in support of their opposition.<br><br>On September 17, 1954, respondent Artemio G. Barron filed a petition before the Commission asking&nbsp; for the issuance of a provisional permit to operate the alleged ferry service to meet public demand.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was opposed&nbsp; by petitioners-oppositors on the ground&nbsp; of&nbsp; lack of jurisdiction, non-compliance&nbsp; by the applicant&nbsp; with the provisions of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code-concerning ferry service, and because there was&nbsp; no&nbsp; public demand for the&nbsp; said service.&nbsp; In&nbsp; an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; February&nbsp;&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Commission&nbsp; granted&nbsp; a&nbsp; provisional&nbsp; permit&nbsp; but&nbsp;&nbsp; not Javellana, et al. vs. Public Service&nbsp; Commission, et al. an exclusive one, authorizing the applicant to operate the service applied for, employing in the same motor vessels "<span style="font-style: italic;">R. O. Barron I"</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">"R. 0. Barron, II"</span>, subject&nbsp; to the conditions contained in the said provisional&nbsp; permit.&nbsp; On February 9,&nbsp; 1955, applicant requested authority to operate the motor vessel "<span style="font-style: italic;">Batangas Liner</span>"&nbsp; as an additional&nbsp; unit on&nbsp; the same Jerry&nbsp; service,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the Commission,&nbsp; in an order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; February 23,. 1955, granted said request.<br><br>Petitioners-oppositors filed&nbsp; a motion for reconsideration of the two orders of February 9th and 23rd, 1955.&nbsp; In an&nbsp; order dated April 11,&nbsp; 1955, the Commission denied the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; To&nbsp; set aside these three orders of the Commission, petitioners herein have filed the present petition for&nbsp; a writ of certiorari.<br><br>The following undisputed facts which we consider&nbsp; pertinent in the&nbsp; consideration, of&nbsp; this&nbsp; case&nbsp; may be stated. The petitioners as well as&nbsp; the respondent at the time of the application for&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; public&nbsp; convenience in question were old operators of motor vessels on the same lines already mentioned between Calapan, Oriental Mindoro and Batangas, Batangas.&nbsp; The motor vessels "<span style="font-style: italic;">R. O. Barron I",&nbsp; R. O' Barron II" </span>and "<span style="font-style: italic;">Batangas Liner</span>" have a gross tonnage of 244.61,&nbsp; 248-47&nbsp; and&nbsp; 70, respectively.&nbsp; The respondent had presented before the Commission resolutions of the Provincial Boards of the provinces of Batangas and Oriental Mindoro&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Municipal Councils of Calapan and Batangas recommending and endorsing to the commission the approval of applicant's petition to operate the ferry&nbsp; service in question.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; basis of the&nbsp; evidence so far presented before&nbsp; the Commission&nbsp; it made the following findings:<br><blockquote>"The evidence presented by applicant shows that he is&nbsp; a&nbsp; Filipino citizen&nbsp; with residence in Cavite&nbsp; City;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he is the owner registered in the&nbsp; Bureau of Customs of&nbsp; the motor&nbsp; vessels <span style="font-style: italic;">"R. O. Barron&nbsp; 7" </span>and "<span style="font-style: italic;">R. O. Barron 12"</span>; that the motor vessel <span style="font-style: italic;">R. O. Barron"</span> was on November 20, 1948 cleared by the Bureau of Customs to operate as a ferry boat between Batangas, Batangas and Calapan, Oriental Mindoro; that motor vessels "<span style="font-style: italic;">R. O. Barron 7"</span> and "<span style="font-style: italic;">B. O. Barron II"</span> were licensed and permitted to engage&nbsp; in the coastwise trade&nbsp; of the Philippines for the period of one year from August&nbsp; 10, 1953 and from May 5, 1953, respectively; that said licenses expired on August 9,&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; and&nbsp; May 4, 1954, respectively;&nbsp; that in addition to the motor vessels "R. 0. Barron I" and "It. 0. Sarron II" applicant will acquire by purchase or lease two PT&nbsp; boats to be used for the proposed ferry&nbsp; service if&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; by&nbsp; this&nbsp; Commission;&nbsp; that he is financially capable of operating the&nbsp; ferry service applied for; that the Provincial Board of&nbsp; Oriental Mindoro,&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Board of Batangas, the Municipal Councils of Calapan, Lobo, and Batangas and the Mayors League of Oriental Mindoro have&nbsp; recommended and endorsed the approval of the ferry service&nbsp; applied for&nbsp; by applicant; and that the members&nbsp; of the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro and the Municipal Mayors of Calapan, Panamalayan,&nbsp; Roxas,&nbsp; Baco, San Teodoro, Naujan,&nbsp; Victoria, Pto. Galera,&nbsp; Pola, and Bongabong have requested this Commission to&nbsp; give immediate approval to this application in order&nbsp; to serve&nbsp; the best interest of the&nbsp; people.<br><br>"The records and the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; also&nbsp; show that applicant and oppoaitors are&nbsp; authorized by this Commission to&nbsp; charge the same rates&nbsp; for the operation of their motor boats&nbsp; between&nbsp; Calapan and Batangas;&nbsp; that in spite&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; uniform 'rates there have been trouble and&nbsp; keen&nbsp; competition among them in vying with one another in getting&nbsp; passengers, said troubled and&nbsp; keen competition arising chiefly from the fact&nbsp; that, they are not authorized&nbsp; definite time schedules by any government agency; that to avoid said trouble and keen competition&nbsp; they entered into&nbsp; agreement fixing their schedules of trips but&nbsp; said agreement was made only to be broken and violated; <span style="font-style: italic;">and that effective regulation of water pransportation services&nbsp; between Calapan and Batangas&nbsp; can be had and maintained&nbsp; if the.Commission will&nbsp; assume&nbsp; control and&nbsp; supervision&nbsp; over their&nbsp; operations.</span>" (Italics supplied)<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"A certificate of the Assistant Director of the Bureau of&nbsp; Coast and Geodetic Survey dated&nbsp; February 4, 1955 shows that the distance between Calapan and Batangas Port is 2A nautical mftes; between Calapan&nbsp; and Lobo Port, 12.4 nautical miles; and between Batangas and&nbsp; Lobo Fort,&nbsp; 17,9&nbsp; nautical&nbsp; miles.&nbsp; The&nbsp; evidence presented also shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; the distance between&nbsp; Calapan&nbsp; and Batangas over the intervening&nbsp; waters—Mindoro Bay,&nbsp; Verde&nbsp; Island&nbsp; Passage&nbsp; and&nbsp; Batangas Bay—may be negotiated or travelled&nbsp; within&nbsp; two&nbsp; to three hours."&nbsp; (Italic supplied)<br></blockquote>In this connection,&nbsp; for a better understanding&nbsp; of the distances involved, we have&nbsp; reduced the&nbsp; 24 nautical&nbsp; miles between Calapan and Batangas to kilometers, namely, 44.47 kilometers.<br><br>The&nbsp; reasons and&nbsp; considerations which&nbsp; induced&nbsp; and prompted the Commission to consider the&nbsp; service between Calapan,&nbsp; Oriental Mindoro&nbsp; and Batangas,&nbsp; Batangas&nbsp; as a ferry service and to grant the provisional permit already mentioned, may be found in the following paragraph contained&nbsp; in its order&nbsp;&nbsp; of February 9, 1955, granting said provisional permit.<br><blockquote>"Oppositors&nbsp; seem&nbsp; to&nbsp; believe&nbsp; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; ferry&nbsp; service&nbsp; is carried&nbsp; by means of small boat, barge or raft.&nbsp; While this may be true in the past or even at' present in certain places, it must be&nbsp; admitted that the progress of&nbsp; science and technology lias&nbsp; brought about a tremendous improvement in the&nbsp; means of&nbsp; modern&nbsp; transportation' so that our concept of a&nbsp; ferry service must not be&nbsp; confined to the f use of small boat, barge or raft.&nbsp; And this is especially true in the&nbsp; instant case for oppositors&nbsp; themselves claim that&nbsp; the&nbsp; intervening waters between CaJapan and&nbsp; Batangas&nbsp; arewide and dangerous with big waves where&nbsp; small boat, barge&nbsp; or&nbsp; raft are not&nbsp; adapted to the service. Evidently,&nbsp; the size, of&nbsp; a boat&nbsp; or vessel&nbsp; is not the decisive or&nbsp; qualifying factor to determine what a ferry service&nbsp; is. What is important is that the&nbsp; boat or vessel to be used&nbsp; for a ferry service must be&nbsp; well-adapted&nbsp; to the conditions&nbsp; obtaining between the&nbsp; places&nbsp; to be served and to the intervening waters&nbsp; over which it passes so&nbsp; as to afford&nbsp; maximum safety, convenience and&nbsp; comfort to the traveling public."<br></blockquote>The question raised and emphasized before us is, whether or not, the operation of the line in Question,&nbsp; considering the distance&nbsp; involved, the&nbsp; nature of the waters&nbsp; to be traversed, and&nbsp; the vessels&nbsp; used, is ferry&nbsp; service,&nbsp; or&nbsp; constitutes interisland or&nbsp; coastwise trade.<br><br>The following definitions of "ferry"&nbsp; are pertinent and illustrative.<br><blockquote>The term "ferry&nbsp; implied&nbsp; the continuation, by means of <span style="font-style: italic;">boats, barges, or rafts,</span> of a highway or the connection of highways located on the opposite banks of a stream or other&nbsp; body of water.&nbsp; The term necessarily implies&nbsp; transportation for a, short distance, almost invariably between two&nbsp; points, which is&nbsp; unrelated&nbsp; to other transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oppositors'&nbsp;&nbsp; Italic.)<br><br>The term "ferry" is often employed to denote the right or franchise granted by the state or its authorized&nbsp; mandatories&nbsp; to&nbsp; continue&nbsp; by means of boats,&nbsp; an&nbsp; interrupted land&nbsp; highway over&nbsp; the interrupting waters and to charge toll for the use&nbsp; thereof by&nbsp; the public.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this sense&nbsp; it has also been&nbsp; defined as a&nbsp; privilege,&nbsp; a liberty,&nbsp; to&nbsp; take tolls for transporting passengers and goods across a lake&nbsp; or&nbsp; stream, or&nbsp; some other body of water,&nbsp; with&nbsp; no essential difference from a bridge franchise&nbsp; except as to the&nbsp; mode of transportation,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">22 Am. Jut. 553.</span><br><br>A "ferry" has been defined by many courts as "a&nbsp; public highway or thoroughfare across&nbsp; a stream&nbsp; of water or river by boat instead of a bridge."&nbsp; (St. Clare County v. Interstate Car and Sand Transfer Co.,&nbsp; 192&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; 454,&nbsp; 48&nbsp; L.&nbsp; ed. 518;&nbsp; etc.)<br><br>"The&nbsp; term ferry&nbsp; is often employed to&nbsp; denote&nbsp; the right or franchise granted by the state&nbsp; or its authorized mandatories&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">to continue</span> by means of boats, an interrupted land highway over the interrupting waters and to charge&nbsp; toll for the use thereof by the&nbsp; public." (Yallejo Ferry Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Solano Aquatic Club, 165 Cal. 255, 131 P. 864, Ann, Cas.&nbsp; 1914C, 1179; etc.)&nbsp; (Oppositors' Italics.)<br><br>"'Perry'&nbsp; is service necessity for&nbsp; common good to reach point across a stream,&nbsp; lagoon, lake,&nbsp; or&nbsp; bay.&nbsp; (U.S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Canadian Pac. Ry.&nbsp; Co. D.C. Was;, 4&nbsp; Supp.&nbsp; 851, 853)"<br><br>"'Ferry' properly&nbsp; means a&nbsp; place&nbsp; of&nbsp; transit across a river&nbsp; or arm of&nbsp; the sea, but in law it is treated as&nbsp; a franchise, and defined as the&nbsp; exclusive right to carry passengers&nbsp; across a&nbsp; river,&nbsp; or&nbsp; arm of the&nbsp; sea, from one vill&nbsp; to another,&nbsp; or to connect a continuous line of&nbsp; road&nbsp; leading from&nbsp; township or vill to&nbsp; another.&nbsp; (Canadian Pac. Ey. Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> CCA. Wash., 73 F. 2d.&nbsp; 831, 832)"<br><br>"Includes various waters: (1) But an arm of the sea may.include various&nbsp; subordinate descriptions of waters, where the tide ebbs&nbsp; and flows..&nbsp; It may be a river, harbor, creek, basin, or bay; and it is sometimes&nbsp; used to designate very extensive Teaches of waters within the projecting capes or&nbsp; points&nbsp; of a country.&nbsp; (See Rex. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.&nbsp;</span> Bruce, Deach, C.C 1093).&nbsp; (2) In an early case the court said:&nbsp; 'The&nbsp; distinction&nbsp; between rivers&nbsp; navigable&nbsp; and&nbsp; not navigable, that is, where the sea&nbsp; does, or does not,&nbsp; ebb and flow,&nbsp; is very ancient.&nbsp; Rex. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Smith,&nbsp; 2 Dougl. 441, 99 Reprint&nbsp; 283.&nbsp; The former arc called arms of'the sea, while the latter pass under the&nbsp; denomination of private or inland rivers.'&nbsp; Adams <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Pease, 2 Conn. 481, 484.<br></blockquote>We&nbsp; are not unmindful&nbsp; of the reasons&nbsp; adduced by&nbsp; the Commission in considering the motorboat service between Calapan and Batangas&nbsp; as <span style="font-style: italic;">ferry</span>; but from our&nbsp; consideration of the law as it stands, particularly Commonwealth, Act No. 146,&nbsp; known as the Public Service Act and&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of the Revised Administrative Code&nbsp; regarding municipal ferries and those regarding the jurisdiction of the. Bureau of Customs over documentation, registration, licensing, inspection, etc.&nbsp; of steamboat's, motorboats&nbsp; or motor vessels, and the definitions of ferry as above quoted, we have the impression and we&nbsp; are inclined&nbsp; to believe that the Legislature intended ferry to mean the service either by barges or rafts, even by motor or steam vessels,. between the banks of a river&nbsp; or&nbsp; stream to continue&nbsp; the ' highway which is interrupted&nbsp; by the body of&nbsp; water,&nbsp; or in some cases, to connect&nbsp; two points on opposite shores of an arm&nbsp; of the sea such as bay or lake which does&nbsp; not Involve too great a distance or too&nbsp; long a time to navigate. But where the line&nbsp; or service involves&nbsp; crossing the open sea like the body of water between the province of Batangas and the'island of Mindoro which&nbsp; the oppositors describe thus "the intervening waters between Calapan and Batangas are wide and dangerous with&nbsp; big waves where&nbsp; small boat, barge or raft are not&nbsp; adapted .to the service," then it is more reasonable to regard' said&nbsp; line or service as more properly belonging to interisland or coastwise trade According to the finding of the Commission itself the distance / between Calapan&nbsp; and Batangas is&nbsp; about&nbsp; 24 nautical miles or about 44.5 kilometers.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; do&nbsp; not believe that this is , the short&nbsp; distance&nbsp; contemplated&nbsp; by the Legislature&nbsp; in referring to ferries whether within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of a single municipality or ferries between two municipalities or provinces.&nbsp; If we are to grant that water transportation between Calapan and Batangas is ferry service, then there would be no reason&nbsp; for not considering&nbsp; the&nbsp; same service&nbsp; between the different islands of the Philippines, such as Boac, Marinduque and&nbsp; Batangas; Roxas&nbsp; City of Capiz and&nbsp; Romblon; Cebu&nbsp; City, Cebu and Ormoc, Leyte; Guiuan,&nbsp; Samar and Surigao,&nbsp; Surigao;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Dumaguete, Negros&nbsp; Oriental and Oroquieta or Cagayan de&nbsp; Oro.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; makes the distinction&nbsp; between ferry service and motorship in&nbsp; the&nbsp; coastwise trade, thus:<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; ferry service is distinguished from a motorship or motorboat service engaged in the coastwise trade in that the latter is intended for the transportation of passengers and/or freight for hire&nbsp; or compensation between ports&nbsp; or places in&nbsp; the Philippines without <span style="font-style: italic;">definite&nbsp; routes</span> or lines of service."<br></blockquote>We&nbsp; cannot agree.&nbsp; The&nbsp; definiteness&nbsp; of the&nbsp; route&nbsp; of&nbsp; a boat&nbsp; is not the&nbsp; deciding&nbsp; factor.&nbsp; A&nbsp; boat of&nbsp; say the William&nbsp; Lines, Inc.&nbsp; goes&nbsp; from Manila&nbsp; to Davao via Cebu,&nbsp; Tagbilaran, Dumaguete,&nbsp; Zamboanga, every week. It has&nbsp; a definite route, and yet it may not for that reason be regarded as engaged in ferry service.&nbsp; Again, a vessel of the&nbsp; Compañia Mariti.ma makes the trip from Manila&nbsp; to Tacloban.&nbsp; and&nbsp; back, twice&nbsp; a&nbsp; week.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly,&nbsp; it has&nbsp; a definite route.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that service is not ferry service, but rather interisland or coastwise&nbsp; trade.<br><br>We believe that it will&nbsp; be more in consonance with the spirit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law&nbsp; to&nbsp; consider&nbsp; steamboat&nbsp; or motorboat service between the 'different islands, involving more&nbsp; or less great&nbsp; distances and&nbsp; over more or&nbsp; less turbulent and dangerous waters&nbsp; of the open&nbsp; sea, to be coastwise or inter island&nbsp; service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, whether said service between the different islands is regarded as ferry service or&nbsp; coastwise trade service, as&nbsp; long as&nbsp; the water&nbsp; craft&nbsp; used as steamboats,&nbsp; motorboats or motor vessels, the result will be the same as&nbsp; far as&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; is&nbsp; concerned.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is evident from the&nbsp; provisions of section 13 (a) and (6)&nbsp; of the Public Service Act,&nbsp; as amended by&nbsp; Commonwealth Act 454 which reproduce below:<br><br>"Sec. 13.&nbsp; (a) The&nbsp; Commission shall have jurisdiction, supervision, and control&nbsp; over all&nbsp; public, services and their&nbsp; franchises, equipment, and other properties, and in&nbsp; the exercise of&nbsp; its authority, it shall have the necessary powers and the aid of the public force:&nbsp; Provided, That it shall <span style="font-style: italic;">have authority to require steamboats, motarships&nbsp; and steamship lines,</span> whether privately owned, or&nbsp; owned or operated by any Government controlled corporation or instrumentality,&nbsp; to <span style="font-style: italic;">obtain certificates of public&nbsp; convenience or to prescribe their definite routes</span> or lines of service;<br><br>(b) The term 'public&nbsp; service'&nbsp; includes every person that now or hereafter may own, operate, manage, or control in the Philippines, for&nbsp; hire or compensation, with genera] or limited clientele, whether permanent, occasional&nbsp; or accidental, and done for general business purposes any common carrier,&nbsp; railroad, street railway, traction railway, subway, motor vehicle, either for freight or passenger, or both, with or without fixed route and whatever may be its classification, freight or carrier service of any class, express service, steamboat,&nbsp; or steamship line, pontines,&nbsp; ferries, and small&nbsp; water craft, engaged, in the&nbsp; transportation of passengers and&nbsp; freight, shipyard, marine railway, marine repair shop, warehouse, wharf or dock,&nbsp; ice&nbsp; plant,&nbsp; ice-refrigeration plant, canal, irrigation system, sewerage, gas, electrict light, heat and power, water supply and power, petroleum, sewerage&nbsp; system, telephone, wire or wireless telegraph system and broadcasting radio&nbsp; stations."&nbsp; (Italics supplied). <br><br>It is true that steamboats,&nbsp; motorboat&nbsp; and motor vessels are included in the public&nbsp; service over which the Commission has jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is equally true,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; that as regards those means of transportation, whether used in a ferry or in the&nbsp; coastwise trade, the Commission has&nbsp; no&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; require&nbsp; them&nbsp; to&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; certificates&nbsp; of&nbsp; public convenience or prescribe their definite route or line. So, inasmuch as&nbsp; the&nbsp; water&nbsp; craft used by the respondent in&nbsp; the service between Calapan&nbsp; and&nbsp; Batangas,&nbsp; namely "<span style="font-style: italic;">R. O. Barron I", "R. O. Barron II</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">Batangas Liner</span>" are motorboats and&nbsp; of&nbsp; considerable tonnage&nbsp; at that,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission had no authority to require the said boats or the respondent to obtain a certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; public convenience&nbsp; or to prescribe their&nbsp; route such as the trip from Calapan to Batangas via Lobo.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we&nbsp; hold that the Commission had authority to&nbsp; prescribe the schedule&nbsp; of their trips and the&nbsp; rates&nbsp; to be&nbsp; charged. <br><br>There might possibly&nbsp; be some doubt as to the authority of the Commission to prescribe the schedule&nbsp; of&nbsp; trips&nbsp; of&nbsp; steamboats, motorboats and motor vessels when engaged in&nbsp; the coastwise or interisland&nbsp; trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the amendment&nbsp; of the Public Service Law,&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 146, section 13 thereof provided&nbsp; that the control&nbsp; and jurisdiction of the Commission over&nbsp; ships shall be limited to the fixing of freight&nbsp; and passenger rates thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Soichi&nbsp; Furugen Transportation&nbsp; vs. Public&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; 66&nbsp; Phil., 91.)&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words,&nbsp; the Commission's&nbsp; general supervision and regulation&nbsp; of,&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; and control over, public services such as the schedule of trips of transportation service. did not&nbsp; extend&nbsp; to ships.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as may be gathered from section&nbsp; 13-(6) the Public Service Act as amended by Commonwealth Act 454, the public services over which the Commission&nbsp; has&nbsp; jurisdiction, supervision and control now includes&nbsp; steamboat or, steamship&nbsp; line, except that as regards&nbsp; steamboat,&nbsp; motorship&nbsp; and steamship line, the Commission cannot require them tp obtain certificates&nbsp; of&nbsp; public convenience&nbsp; or to, prescribe&nbsp; their respective routes or lines, or service.&nbsp; The logical inference is that in all other respects the Commission has jurisdiction, supervision and control over steamboats, motor vessels and steamship lines,&nbsp; including prescribing the schedule&nbsp; of their departures , and' arrivals.<br><br>We&nbsp; see no reason&nbsp; why&nbsp; the petitioners and respondent ,&nbsp; herein could not continue their motorboat service between Calapan&nbsp; and Batangas whether direct or via Lobo as they have done in the past&nbsp; without&nbsp; any certificate&nbsp; of public convenience. The evils resulting from the competition I&nbsp; could well be remedied by the&nbsp; Commission by fixing a definite schedule for them as well as their rates.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the foregoing,&nbsp; we&nbsp; hold that the&nbsp; motorboat service between Calapan, Oriental Mindoro and Batangas, Batangas, constitutes&nbsp; interisland and coast wise trade; that the Commission has no authority to require petitioners and respondents, operators of said service to obtain a certificate of public convenience, or permit to operate, but that&nbsp; it may prescribe&nbsp; the schedule' of trips and passenger and freight rates.&nbsp; The parties herein are&nbsp; reverted&nbsp; to&nbsp; their status&nbsp; as operators&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; commencement of&nbsp; these proceedings before the Commission,&nbsp; and such proceedings, including the orders involved are&nbsp; held null and void.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bautista Angelo, Conception, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Jugo, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><center><br><i>CONCURRING:</i><br></center><br><br>REYES, A. J.,<br><br>I concur in so far as the decision holds that the Public Service Commission is without authority to require operators of steam or motor boats engaged in transportation for the public to have a certificate of public convenience; but i reserve my vote on the question of whether the Commission is authorized to fix the schedule of trips for those boats.</div>
