				<H3>MANUEL G. TORRES, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF  MALALAG, DAVAO, ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Manuel G.&nbsp; Torres&nbsp; is appealing from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao (Branch II) in&nbsp; Special Civil Case No. 101, dismissing his petition for mandamus, seeking his reinstatement as patrolman,&nbsp; on the ground that the Municipal Ordinance No. 33 of the Municipality of Malalag, Davao, creating the position to which he had been&nbsp; appointed, was invalid&nbsp; for lack of the&nbsp; necessary approval of the Secretary of Finance. <br><br>The facts in the case are not disputed.&nbsp; On September 15,1955, the Municipal Council of Malalag enacted General Appropriation Ordinance No. 33 for the fiscal year 1955-1956, and&nbsp; created six additional positions for patrolman in the police force, at the same time appropriating the sum of P22440.00 for the entire police force, including the six additional positions for patrolman, as against the amount of P14,760.00 for said police force for the preceding fiscal year.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ordinance was sent directly to the Department of Finance, but on&nbsp; November 19, 1955,&nbsp; the department referred the&nbsp; same to the Provincial Treasurer of&nbsp; Davao, who in turn referred it&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Municipal Treasurer&nbsp; of Malalag, requesting&nbsp; that&nbsp; a budget analysis&nbsp; and plantilla of personnel&nbsp; be submitted.&nbsp; On&nbsp; February 21,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; the Davao Provincial Treasurer returned the Ordinance to the Secretary of&nbsp; Finance, recommending that the creation of six additional positions for patrolman be held in abeyance until&nbsp; the. municipality could pay&nbsp; the Provincial Government its obligation amounting to P6,892.20. <br><br>In the meantime, on November 15,1955, appellant Torres, a patrolman civil service eligible; was appointed by Mayor Lanzar to one&nbsp; of the six&nbsp; additional positions&nbsp; created by Ordinance No. 33.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; evidence showing that said appointment was made with the consent of the Municipal Council, as&nbsp; required&nbsp; by Section 2159 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, which reads thus: <br><blockquote>"Appointments to&nbsp; all non-elective positions in. the municipal) service shall be made by the municipal mayor by and with the consent of a majority of&nbsp; all the members of the&nbsp; municipal council except that&nbsp; of the municipal secretary which shall be made exclusively by the mayor.&nbsp; This requirement shall not however apply to the employment of laborers engaged for the performance of authorized works, nor to local employees&nbsp; or laborers whose duties are connected with health work and who shall be appointed by the Chief local health officer upon recommendation of the mayor."&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>On January 9,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; upon the advent of the new local administration,&nbsp; the&nbsp; new Municipal Council passed .Resolution&nbsp; No. 13, abolishing the&nbsp; six&nbsp; positions&nbsp; of&nbsp; patrolman aforementioned, including&nbsp; the one then already occupied by Torres, the&nbsp; reason given for the abolition&nbsp; being that Appropriation Ordinance No. 33&nbsp; had not been approved by the Secretary&nbsp; of Finance&nbsp; and also because there was a letter by the&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Treasurer's Office, advising the Municipal Council to abolish said six&nbsp; positions&nbsp; because the municipality of Malalag had a standing obligation of P7,029.00 as of that date. <br><br>On January 14, 1956, the new Mayor issued&nbsp; an official order implementing Resolution No. 13, declaring appellant Torres one of those separated from&nbsp; the service, effective on the close of&nbsp; office hours on January&nbsp; 15, 1956.&nbsp; Torres went to the Mayor, requesting that he be retained in&nbsp; the service, but the Mayor told him that&nbsp; he&nbsp; could not do anything on the matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Torres next&nbsp; wrote to the PCAC about his alleged illegal&nbsp; dismissal, and although the PCAC sent&nbsp; a representative to Davao to look into the matter, no action&nbsp; was taken&nbsp; on his complaint. <br><br>On June 31,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; the same Municipal Council&nbsp; that passed Resolution No. 13 abolishing1 the six positions&nbsp; of patrolman, passed Resolution No. 76, increasing the police force of Malalag by five (one lieutenant,&nbsp; two corporals, and&nbsp; two&nbsp; patrolmen), the&nbsp; reason given&nbsp; being that&nbsp; "the Municipality of Malalag is now capable to pay the salaries of additional positions&nbsp; in the police force as well as other positions, after paying the standing obligation of the Municipality to the provincial government."&nbsp; Upon the creation&nbsp; of these five additional positions in the police force, Torres again went to the Mayor, asking for his reinstatement, but his&nbsp; request was denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; So,&nbsp; on July 24, 1956, Torres&nbsp; initiated the present case for mandamus.&nbsp; After hearing, the trial court dismissed the petition, holding in effect that the&nbsp; position to which appellant Torres had been appointed did not&nbsp; legally&nbsp; exist, nor the amount&nbsp; appropriated for it, for the reason that Appropriation Ordinance No.&nbsp; 33, Series of 1955, had&nbsp; never been&nbsp; approved by the Secretary of Finance. <br><br>To us,&nbsp; the&nbsp; important and&nbsp; decisive question involved is whether or not Appropriation Ordinance No. 33, Series of 1955, of the Municipal Council of Malalag was valid and effective at the time that petitioner Torres was appointed to one of the six additional positions for patrolman created by said&nbsp; ordinance.&nbsp; After a&nbsp; careful&nbsp; study of this legal point,&nbsp; we&nbsp; agree with the trial court, presided by Judge Amador E. Gomez,, who incidentally, rendered an exhaustive&nbsp; and well&nbsp; prepared decision, that said Appropriation Ordinance No. 33 required the approval of the Secretary of Finance.&nbsp; Section;2296 of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative Code as amended by Republic Act No. 1062, in part reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 2296. <span style="font-style: italic;">Appropriation Ordinance.</span>â€”Upon receipt of the budget, the municipal council shall, on the basis thereof, enact the general appropriation ordinance, <span style="font-style: italic;">including therein all statutory and contractual&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; of the municipality</span>&nbsp; and&nbsp; upon&nbsp; enactment by the council and approved by the mayor, the ordinance&nbsp; shall, on the date therein fixed for its effectivity and subject to appeal to the provincial board as hereinafter provided, be in full force and&nbsp; effect: Provided however, that&nbsp; if the aggregate amount so appropriated&nbsp; exceeds the said&nbsp; estimated receipts, then the ordinance shall be effective only when approved by the Secretary of&nbsp; Finance. * * *" (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>It is true that under the legal provisions above-reproduced, the&nbsp; approval of the Secretary of&nbsp; Finance is required if the aggregate amount appropriated exceeds&nbsp; the&nbsp; estimated receipts.&nbsp; However, it is in our opinion also&nbsp; clear that the inclusion in&nbsp; the said appropriation ordinance of all statutory&nbsp; and contractual obligations of the. municipality is mandatory, otherwise, the&nbsp; non-inclusion of said statutory and&nbsp; contractual obligations and&nbsp; provisions for their payment might&nbsp; result in an unbalanced budget,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; that the municipality would be appropriating and spending more money than&nbsp; It has&nbsp; or it will have during the fiscal year, the very case or situation included in the proviso, namely, the aggregate amount appropriated exceeding the estimated receipts, which require&nbsp; the approval of the&nbsp; Secretary of Finance for&nbsp; the effectivity&nbsp; of the appropriation ordinance.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; trial court wisely observed, failure to state in an appropriation ordinance the statutory and contractual obligations of the municipality and appropriation or provision for their payment would "violate and&nbsp; ignore the essence of all appropriation measures, which&nbsp; is,&nbsp; that they must provide&nbsp; not&nbsp; only for the&nbsp; contemplated expenditures&nbsp; but also for the&nbsp; payment of outstanding obligations." There is a similar provision of law regarding&nbsp; provincial budgets, contained in Section 2120 of&nbsp; the Revised Administrative Code,&nbsp; as amended by Republic Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1063. In the&nbsp; instructions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Provincial Treasurer to all Municipal&nbsp; Treasurers in the Province&nbsp; of Davao,&nbsp; as&nbsp; contained in his Office Circular No. 517, dated April 12, 1956, regarding the effectivity of appropriation ordinances,&nbsp; the following provisions appear: <br><br>"Under the provisions of Republic Acts&nbsp; Nos.&nbsp; 1063&nbsp; and 1062, provincial and municipal budgets shall be in full force and effect on the date therein mixed for their effectivity&nbsp; by the provincial board and municipal council respectively, provided that: <br><br>(1) Full provisions have&nbsp; been made&nbsp; for&nbsp; all statutory&nbsp; and/or current contractual obligations;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>(2) The aggregate amount&nbsp; appropriated&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; exceed&nbsp; the receipts estimated&nbsp; by the Treasurer; Therefore, if any or both of these conditions are met, the budget shall riot take effect unless approved by the Department of Finance in the manner prescribed by law," It&nbsp; is true that said office circular, being dated&nbsp; April 12, 1956,&nbsp; was subsequent to the approval by&nbsp; the Municipal Council of&nbsp; Appropriation Ordinance No.&nbsp; 33, but&nbsp; we find that said Office&nbsp; Circular No. 517 was&nbsp; based on&nbsp; and was copied&nbsp; verbatim from Provincial Circular&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; dated July 81,&nbsp; 1954, of the&nbsp; Department of Finance, which reads as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"Effectivity of Budgets&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></div><br>"Under&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of Republic&nbsp; Acts Nos. 1063 and 1062, provincial and municipal budgets shall be in full force and effect 'on the date therein-fixed for their&nbsp; effectivity by the&nbsp; provincial board and&nbsp; municipal council, respectively&nbsp; provided&nbsp; that:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>(1) Full provisions have been made for all statutory&nbsp; and&nbsp; or current&nbsp; contractual obligations; and &nbsp;<br><br>(2) The aggregate amount appropriated does not exceed the receipts&nbsp; estimated by the treasurer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>"Therefore, if any&nbsp; or both of these two conditions are not met, the budget shall not take effect unless approved by the Department of Finance in the manner prescribed by law."&nbsp; </blockquote>The above-reproduced circular of the Department of Finance of July 31, 1954 certainly was binding on the effectivity&nbsp; of municipal appropriation ordinances&nbsp; passed by municipal councils, particularly, Appropriation Ordinance No.&nbsp; 33; which was passed in 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be observed from this circular No. 10&nbsp; that the approval of the Department of Finance is required not only&nbsp; when the&nbsp; aggregate; amount appropriated&nbsp; exceeds the estimated receipts' but also when there&nbsp; is failure to provide for the payment of all&nbsp; statutory and current contractual&nbsp; obligations of the municipality.&nbsp; This circular of the Department of Finance may be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; as a Contemporaneous interpretation of Section 2296&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code, as amended, by the Department concerned,&nbsp; and constitutes persuasive authority to which we agree.&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that when a&nbsp; municipality has&nbsp; standing obligations,&nbsp; statutory or contractual, it should state the same in its appropriation ordinance and provide for their payment, and if the municipality concerned fails to&nbsp; do so, it is reasonable that the Department of Finance take a&nbsp; hand in the matter and make suggestions or impose conditions for the payment or liquidation of said obligation before the appropriation ordinance becomes&nbsp; effective, which effectivity depends on the approval by the Department of Finance. <br><br>Having arrived at this conclusion, we deem it unnecessary to determine the effect of Resolution No. 13 of January&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1956, abolishing the&nbsp; six positions of patrolman, including the one then occupied by petitioner Torres, for the reason that&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; appropriation ordinance creating said additional&nbsp; positions did&nbsp; not take effect&nbsp; because&nbsp; it was never&nbsp; approved by the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Finance, and consequently, said six additional positions did not legally exist, then&nbsp; there was nothing&nbsp; to abolish. <br><br>In conclusion,&nbsp; we hold that the position to which petitioner Torres was appointed as patrolman did not exist at the time of his appointment on November 15, 1955.&nbsp; Consequently, there was no position to which he could be reinstated.&nbsp; Furthermore, as already stated,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; failed to prove that he was legally appointed with the consent of the municipal council, which consent is necessary for a valid appointment by the Mayor.&nbsp; In a case of mandamus, the petitioner should establish a clear right, not&nbsp; one&nbsp; based on a mere presumption of the law that in the absence of evidence to the&nbsp; contrary, his appointment was&nbsp; consented to by the municipal council.&nbsp; The copy of his appointment, Exhibit&nbsp; "B", shows neither approval&nbsp; of the&nbsp; municipal council nor that of the Commissioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Civil Service.&nbsp; <br><br>However, considering the circumstances surrounding the present case, we cannot help&nbsp; but sympathize with the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; is a civil&nbsp; service eligible, was&nbsp; appointed to a position which he thought existed, accepted&nbsp; the appointment and occupied&nbsp; the position. Legally, there was no such position, and therefore, there could have been no valid&nbsp; appointment.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Council&nbsp; of Malalag&nbsp; later created five positions&nbsp; in its police force.&nbsp; Why&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; considering&nbsp; his&nbsp; civil&nbsp; service&nbsp; elegibility was not appointed to one of said positions,&nbsp; even as patrolman, at least to make amends for the error&nbsp; of the municipal council and the Mayor and for the trouble caused to the petitioner, is not explained.&nbsp; It might&nbsp; be a&nbsp; good idea and an&nbsp; act&nbsp; of simple justice if the Mayor or the council could appoint petitioner to one of said five positions in the police force if not yet filled, or&nbsp; else&nbsp; accord&nbsp; him preference in appointment to the next vacancy.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this is&nbsp; a mere idea or suggestion,&nbsp; not&nbsp; an order. <br><br>In view&nbsp; of the foregoing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; hereby affirmed. &nbsp;<br><br>No costs.&nbsp; We deem&nbsp; it unnecessary to discuss and determine the other questions&nbsp; raised in the appeal. <br><br><i>Paras, C, J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista&nbsp; Angela, Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur. </div>
