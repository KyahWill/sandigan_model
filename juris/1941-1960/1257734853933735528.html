				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 10, 1957, Mariano Cojuangco filed a complaint for forcible entry 
against Eugenio Bardaje, Cecilio Cajefe, and Damasino Cajefe in the Justice of 
the Peace Court of Santa Rita, Samar, involving a parcel of land situated in 
that municipality. During the pendency of the case, plaintiff prayed for the 
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction to be placed in the possession of 
the premises, and upon his filing of a bond in the amount of P600, the motion 
was granted. Defendants, however, filed a counterbond in the sum of P1,200, with 
Bernardo Orosa and Feliciana Bardaje as bondsmen. Thereupon, the writ of 
preliminary injunction was lifted, and defendants remained in the possession of 
the land in question.
<p>On September 26, 1957, judgment was rendered by the justice of the peace 
court in favor of plaintiff, ordering defendants to restore to him possession of 
the land in dispute and to pay him P300 actual damages and P100 attorney's fees. 
Defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance. No motion for immediate 
execution of the judgment was, however, filed by plaintiff either in the 
inferior court or in the court of first instance, so that defendants continued 
to possess the land in question pending the appeal.</p>
<p>On February 19, 1958, the Court of First Instance of Samar rendered judgment 
in the case, declaring plaintiff to be the lawful possessor of the land in 
question, and condemning the defendants to vacate the same and pay plaintiff 
damages of P90 for the year 1956, P360 for the year 1957, and P90 for every 
quarter thereafter until delivery of the land in dispute to plaintiff is 
effected. Defendants received copy of the decision on February 23, 1958, and 
they interposed no appeal.</p>
<p>The judgment having become final and executory, plaintiff, on July 12, 1958, 
moved for the execution thereof, and an order of execution was accordingly 
issued. Because the provincial sheriff could not find sufficient properties of 
the defendants to satisfy the judgment for damages and costs, plaintiff filed a 
petition <em>ex parte</em> for an order of execution against the counterbond 
posted by the defendants in order to lift the writ of preliminary injunction 
issued in the inferior court, which petition the court granted. Notified of the 
order of execution against the bond, defendants moved for the reconsideration 
thereof on the ground that the same was null and void for having been issued 
without notice to them and without giving them their day in court, and that 
furthermore, said bond was good only for the lifting of the writ of preliminary 
injunction in the justice of the peace court but not for the purpose of 
satisfying the award of damages to plaintiff in the court of first instance. 
Reconsideration having been denied, defendants filed a petition for certiorari 
before this Court (G. R. No. L-14831), but for one reason or another, the 
petition was dismissed for lack of merit. In the meantime, the provincial 
sheriff, acting on the order of t execution, advertised for sale at public 
auction on July 28, 1959 the real properties posted by defendant's bondsmen to 
secure the bond in question. To enjoin the sale, defendants and their bondsmen 
filed with this Court the present petition for prohibition. It appears, though, 
that four days after the petition was filed and before the submission of 
respondents' answer, the sale sought to be enjoined had already taken place on 
the date set, July 28, 1959.</p>
<p>We find that the writ of execution against petitioners' counterbond is null 
and void for having been issued without notice to defendants' sureties and after 
the judgment on the merits had already become final and executory.</p>
<p>The present case falls squarely within the doctrine laid by this Court in the 
case of Alliance Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. <em>vs</em>. Hon. Edmundo S. 
Piccio, et al., 105 Phil., 1196. There, a writ of preliminary injunction was 
issued by the Court of First Instance <em>pendente lite</em> in a case for 
recovery of possession of property and damages, which writ was dissolved upon 
defendants' filing a counterbond. After trial the court rendered judgment 
ordering defendants to deliver possession of the property in question to 
plaintiff and to pay the latter the amount of P8,416 as damages. The Court of 
Appeals affirmed the judgment <em>in toto</em>. After the case was remanded to 
the court of origin, plaintiff moved for execution. The writ was, however, 
returned unsatisfied because defendants had no properties with which to satisfy 
the judgment. Whereupon, plaintiff filed a motion for the issuance of an 
<em>alias</em> writ of execution against the surety on the defendant's 
counterbond to lift the writ of preliminary injunction issued in the trial 
court, and the motion was granted. On petition for certiorari to this Court by 
the surety, we held, after reviewing all the cases previously decided by us on 
the matter, that, where plaintiff's claim for damages had already been awarded 
in the main decision <em>without notice to the surety</em> and the decision had 
already become final and executory, said claim can no longer be pressed against 
the surety, because to hold the surety liable, notice to it should be given 
either before the trial or, at the latest, before entry of final judgment, so 
that an award for damages against it may be included in said final judgment, 
pursuant to section 9, Rule 60, in relation to section 20, Rule 59, of the Rules 
of Court, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 9. <em>Judgment to include damages against party and sureties</em>.— 
Upon the trial the amount of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff, or to the 
defendant, as the case may be, upon the bond of the other party, shall be 
claimed, ascertained, and awarded under the same procedure as prescribed in 
section 20 of Rule 59." (Rule 60, Injunction).</p>
<p>"Sec. 20. <em>Claim for damages on plaintiff's bond on account of illegal 
attachment</em>.—If the judgment on the action be in favor of the defendant, he 
may recover, upon the bond given by the plaintiff, damages resulting from the 
attachment. Such damages may be awarded only upon application and after proper 
hearing, and shall be included in the final judgment. The application must be 
filed be-fore the trial or, in the discretion of the court, before entry of the 
final judgment, with due notice to the plaintiff and his surety or sureties, 
setting forth the facts showing his right to damages and the amount thereof. 
Damages sustained during the pendency of an appeal may be claimed by the 
defendant, if the judgment of the appellate court be favorable to him. by filing 
an application there-with, with notice to the plaintiff and his surety cr 
sureties, and the appellate court may allow the application to be heard and 
decided by the trial court." (Rule 59, Attachment.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It has been argued that the reference to section 20 of Rule 59 does not apply 
to counterbonds posted to lift preliminary injunctions already issued, for the 
reason that the sureties in such counterbonds are aware from the very first of 
the existence of a claim for damages, and that the rule applicable to such 
counterbonds is not section 20 but section 17 of Rule 59. We do not believe such 
a distinction is warranted in the case of injunctions, since the express terms 
of section 9 of Rule 60, already quoted, "the amount of damages to be awarded to 
the plaintiff or to the defendant . . . upon the <em>bond of the other 
party</em>," are broad enough to cover both kinds of bonds, whether posted to 
obtain the issuance of a preliminary writ of injunction or filed to secure its 
dissolution; and Rule 59 makes section 20 thereof applicable to either. To apply 
the terms of section 20, Rule 59 only to bonds posted to obtain writs of 
injunction would leave vague and uncertain the procedure for assessing damages 
against the sureties in counterbonds for the dissolution of such writ. This 
Court has already settled the procedure to be followed in proceeding against 
bonds in Del Rosario vs. Nava, 95 Phil., 637; 50 Off. Gaz. (9) 4189.</p>
<p>The fact that the surety in an injunction counterbond is aware that damages 
are being claimed against his principal, while sureties in a bond to obtain a 
writ of injunction do not know whether the enjoined party will or will not claim 
damages subsequently, is not substantial enough to warrant a distinction in 
treatment, since mere allegation of damages is not proof thereof. Even if the 
counterbondsmen know that the party who originally obtained the dissolved 
injunction is claiming damages, the truth and extent of such damages remain 
dependent upon subsequent proof, and the counterbondsmen are certainly entitled 
to be notified and heard on the question before final judgment against them is 
rendered; nor do we see any justification why the uncertainty of a 
counterbonds-man's liability should be prolonged beyond the entry of the 
judgment that finally settles the responsibility of his principal. </p>
<p>The diverse rule in section 17 of Rule 59 for counterbonds posted to obtain 
the lifting of a writ of attachment is due to these bonds being security for the 
payment of any judgment that the attaching party may obtain; they are thus mere 
replacements of the property formerly attached, and just as the latter may be 
levied upon after final judgment in the case in order to realize the amount 
adjudged, so is the liability of the countersureties ascertainable after the 
judgment has become final. This situation does not obtain in the case of 
injunction counterbonds, since the sureties in the latter case merely undertake 
"to pay all damages that the plaintiff may suffer by reason of the continuance 
... of the acts complained of" (Rule 60, section 6) and not to secure payment of 
the judgment recovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> We, therefore, 
hold that the court below acted without jurisdiction in issuing a writ of 
execution against the sureties of defendants in this case on their counterbond 
to lift the writ of preliminary injunction in the justice of the peace court, 
for lack of notice to and hearing of said sureties, and after the judgment in 
the case had long become final and executory. And as the writ of execution 
against the bond is null and void, the execution sale conducted by the 
provincial sheriff pursuant thereto is also completely null and void and should 
be set aside.</p>
<p>Respondents claim, however, that prohibition is not the proper remedy in this 
case, the public auction sale sought to be enjoined having been already 
accomplished, prohibition being available only to prevent, not to correct, an 
act or proceeding. Although prohibition is, indeed, a preventive and not a 
corrective remedy, it does not mean, however, that no affirmative relief may be 
given petitioners in this case. For it is not the title or caption of a 
pleading, but the substance and averments thereof, that is controlling, and this 
Court has held time and again that in the interest of justice, although a 
petition is styled certiorari, it may be considered a petition for mandamus if 
the facts alleged make out a case for the issuance of the latter writ,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> or, conversely, a petition for mandamus 
may be considered one for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>. 
Similarly, the present petition, which makes out a petition for certiorari to 
annul the writ of execution in question and the public auction sale conducted 
pursuant thereto, may be considered as such to justify the issuance of the writ 
of certiorari for the nullification and setting aside of said writ of execution 
and sale.</p>
<p>As for respondent's claim that the present petition ia fatally defective 
because it is not properly verified, that is, counsel who verified the petition 
did not swear that the contents thereof are true of his own knowledge but only 
"to the best of his knowledge and belief"; the claim is untenable because it is 
only when the person verifying is other than the attorney who signs the pleading 
that the affiant must state that the allegations thereof are true of his 
knowledge, but when the complaint is signed by the attorney, the latter's oath 
couched in the usual form "Subscribed and sworn to before me, etc." is 
substantial compliance with the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
Besides, it has been held that where the affiant swears that the contents of the 
complaint "are true to the best of his knowledge, information and belief"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> or "to the best of his knowledge and 
belief,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> verification is 
sufficient.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the writ of execution and public auction sale complained of in 
this petition are declared null and void and hereby set aside, with costs 
against respondent Mariano Cojuangco.</p>
