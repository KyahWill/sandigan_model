				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the afternoon of January 17, 1950, about five o'clock, General 
Mariano Castaneda of the Philippine Army, accompanied by his aide, 
Colonel Valentin Salgado and his orderly Sgt. Manadao were returning on 
horseback from V. Luna Hospital in Kamias District to Camp Murphy, both 
places in Quezon City.  Riding along a winding trail until they reached 
Kamias Road, they turned towards Highway 54.  Colonel Salgado rode 
abreast with the general on the left side, the orderly following them 
slightly to the right.  The party had just passed the corner when they 
were suddenly fired upon, with a burst of an automatic rifle whizzing 
from the direction of some bamboo clumps about fifteen meters distant.  
Mortally wounded in the left armpit, Colonel Salgado dropped from his 
mount; and General Castaneda, sensing grave peril galloped away to the 
City Hall, narrowly missing another hail of bullets.  His orderly 
hurried away too, proceeding to Camp Murphy and leading Colonel 
Salgado's horse.
  <p>    Captain Andres Bambao of the Quezon City Police and his men 
immediately repaired to the scene of the crime, brought Colonel 
Salgado's lifeless body to a hospital, and began the search for the 
sniper or snipers who had decamped in the meantime.</p>
  <p>    People living or found around the vicinity were naturally 
questioned.  Jose Ramos, a stone-cutter in nearby quarries was picked up
 several times for investigation.  He was finally released after he had 
promised to assist in tracking down the guilty persons.  Upon returning 
to work he noticed that two stone-cutters, co-workers of his, Bernardo 
de los Santos and Serapio Torres, had disappeared since the afternoon of
 January 17.  He so informed Captain Bambao and both agreed upon a 
definite plan of action.  Ramos pretended he was hiding in Kamias 
district from the authorities, and the police conducted feigned searches
 for him.  Meanwhile he endeavored and was able to contact Bernardo and 
Serapio then also lying low.  These at first refused to believe Ramos 
was a fugitive.  But when informed of raids conducted by the police to 
apprehend Ramos, they fell for the trick, and gave him their confidence.
  And one day when the three were in conversation partaking a "merienda"
 with Eusebio Santos, Ramos casually remarked to Santos that he wished 
he had a gun for protection against the police.  Completely taken in, 
Serapio Torres volunteered the information that he knew where a gun 
could be obtained, but it was a fatal weapon (delinquente) because it 
had been used in killing (Col.) Salgado.  Serapio further revealed that 
he had concealed that gun in the creek nearby.  Soon Ramos secretly 
relayed the hot tip to Captain Bambao.</p>
  <p>    (The police at that time already knew the kind of firearm used,
 because in the morning of January 18, 1950 Detective Rosauro Alcantara 
discovered 28 empty shells fired from a carbine caliber .30, near the 
bamboo grove and the postmortem showed the bullet that finished Col. 
Salgado was of that kind.)</p>
  <p>    Serapio was arrested, and search for the firearm in the creek 
started.  For two days laborers dived, with no result.  The fire 
department was even requested, and began to pump the water from the 
creek.  The record does not say so, but probably when Torres was told 
and realized that sooner or later the gun would be recovered from the 
creek, he finally confessed to Captain Bambao that he hid it there after
 the shooting because he was forced to do it by Nick Pamintuan.  Then he
 plunged into the water and retrieved the murderous weapon — an 
automatic carbine, which, because of its cut butt, Ramos immediately 
identified as the gun he had seen in the hands of Bernardo de los Santos
 a month before.  Two magazines were also retrieved by him near the 
carbine — from the bottom of the creek.</p>
  <p>    Torres was kept in custody after that, but a few days later he 
escaped and was recaptured by the Manila Police, whose Lieutenant 
Enrique B. Morales took charge of his investigation, in the course of 
which Serapio revealed the existence in Kamias of a group called 
Samahang Sandatahan (Society of Armed Men) the purpose of which was to 
overthrow the government and to liquidate high government officials.  He
 mentioned names in the list Exh. H-1 written by himself (Serapio).  In 
that group Serapio was the consultant and Bernardo de los Santos, 
member.  Other names disclosed by him were those of Nick Pamintuan and 
Pabling.  Thereafter he indicated Bernardo de los Santos "as one of the 
companions of Nicasio Pamintuan and Pabling" responsible for the death 
of Colonel Salgado.  (Jose Ramos had also revealed the existence of such
 organization, with the significant detail that Nick (Pamintuan) and 
Pabling were the "trigger men" thereof.)</p>
  <p>    Lt. Morales reported the news to Captain Bambao; and Bernardo 
de los Santos was apprehended in Longos, Laguna where he had fled, 
according to Serapio Torres.  Quizzed by Sgt. Leones of the Detective 
Division, Bernardo de los Santos declared that afternoon of January 17 
he was at the window of the house of Eusebio de los Santos (near the 
scene of the shooting) and saw Nick (Pamintuan) and Pabling going to the
 bamboo grove; that later he heard a volley of shots and say Nick and 
Pabling hurrying to the creek; that he also ran and overtook them in the
 field; that before they parted Nick gave him a pistol, and then handed 
to Pio (Serapio) a carbine.</p>
  <p>    Mainly on the strength of the above facts, the city attorney of
 Quezon City filed on March 21, 1950 an information for attempted murder
 and murder against Nick Pamintuan, Serapio Torres, Bernardo de los 
Santos and Pabling "Doe".</p>
  <p>    The case proceeded against Serapio and Bernardo because the 
other two had not been arrested.  During the trial held in the months of
 April and May, 1950 before the Hon. Demetrio Encarnacion, General 
Castaneda, Capt. Andres Bambao, Jose Ramos, Rosauro Alcantara, Enrique 
B. Morales, Sgt. Leones and others testified to the events herein set 
forth.</p>
  <p>    There was also evidence that the newly-found carbine and the 
magazines, together with the 28 empty shells picked on January 18 near 
the bamboo trees were submitted to the National Bureau of Investigation.
  And Edgar Bond, Chief of the Ballistics &amp; Questioned Documents 
Section of that Bureau declared in court that the 28 shells had been 
fired from the identical carbine.</p>
  <p>    Furthermore, Eusebio Santos, who lived near the bamboo trees 
testified that afternoon of January 17, he was sick in bed in his house 
near the site of the ambuscade; that startled by the volley of shots 
fired from the bamboo grove, he got up, looked and saw Nick and Pabling 
hurrying to the creek, the first with a carbine in hand, followed by 
Serapio Torres and Bernardo de los Santos; that a little later Pabling 
returned to enjoin him under pain of death not to report to the 
authorities, threat which was repeated three weeks afterwards by Nick 
and Pabling.</p>
  <p>    The trial judge gave full credit to the evidence of the 
prosecution in his decision of May 29, 1950, and declared that Serapio 
Torres, Bernardo de los Santos, Nick Pamintuan and Pabling, being 
members of the Samahang Sandatahan conspired to ambush and did ambush 
General Castaneda and Colonel Salgado, slaying the latter, and 
imperilling the life of the former.  He consequently sentenced them to 
life imprisonment and to pay jointly and severally, the sum of P6,000.00
 to the heirs of the deceased.</p>
  <p>    The two defendants promptly appealed, and the <i>expediente</i>
 was forwarded to the Court of Appeals, wherein their counsel of record,
 by his communication dated July 7, 1950, gave notice that they were 
"withdrawing our intention to appeal".  The Court of Appeals, however, 
required "counsel to submit a petition to said effect signed by all 
appellants in person".  Thereafter, the appellate tribunal forwarded the
 record to this Supreme Court, because the penalty imposed by the trial 
judge was reclusion perpetua.</p>
  <p>    Here the appellants submitted a printed brief vigorously 
maintaining their innocence.  Obviously they changed their minds about 
withdrawing their appeal.  However, inasmuch as the penalty meted out to
 them by the court <i>a quo</i> was less than they deserved, maybe 
someone committed a tactical error.</p>
  <p>    There is no doubt in our minds that the proofs presented by the
 prosecution hereinbefore described sufficiently establish the 
participation of these two appellants in the murder of Colonel Salgado 
and the attempt upon the life of General Castañeda.</p>
  <p>    The evidence for the defense consisted only of the 
uncorroborated, contradicted and incredible testimony of the two 
defendants themselves.</p>
  <p>    Having been tricked into disclosing the whereabouts of the 
murderous weapon and realizing its implications, Serapio Torres related 
the unlikely story that on said afternoon he was cutting stones in the 
quarry; that immediately after the shooting two men "came to the place 
where he was working and ordered him to hide a gun in the creek, with 
the threat that he should follow the said order, otherwise he would be 
killed."  We say unlikely because, as the prosecution says, it is 
ridiculous to believe that a criminal would entrust the disposal of the 
weapon used in the ambuscade to one who was not a co-conspirator — even 
to a total stranger, Serapio Torres having asserted that he was not 
acquainted with Nick.</p>
  <p>    Bernardo de los Santos claimed, and swore before the court, 
that at the time of the shooting he was asleep in the house of his 
sister.  Yet he did not present her in corroboration, nor did he explain
 his failure to do so.  That sister again could have confirmed his 
allegation that afternoon he escaped from Kamias and went into hiding 
because she informed him the authorities were arresting all the men in 
the district.  This wholesale arrest was of course an improbable story; 
but it was intended to counteract the logical inference of guilt from 
his having escaped and hidden for some time until his capture in Laguna 
province.  And Eusebio Santos who testified to having seen him running 
away from the scene of the crime together with Nick, Pabling and Serapio
 Torres was his close relative, his brother having married Eusebio's 
sister.  (P. 189, t.s.n.)</p>
  <p>    In our considered opinion the judgment of conviction rested on 
sufficient evidence.  Two crimes were perpetrated: murder and attempted 
murder.  The appealed decision imposed on these appellants the correct 
penalty for the murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code).  But they should 
also atone for the attempt on the life of General Castañeda with an 
additional imprisonment of not less than four years and 2 months of 
prision correccional nor more than eight years of prision mayor, i.e., 
the medium period, because although the offenses was committed in 
disregard of rank, they are entitled to the mitigating circumstance of 
lack of instruction.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, thus modified, the appealed decision is affirmed, 
with costs against appellants.  So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo</i>
 and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.<br> 
    <i>Bautista Angelo, J.,</i> no part.</p>
