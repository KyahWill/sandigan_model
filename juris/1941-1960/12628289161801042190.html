				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a nutshell the most&nbsp; important question&nbsp; presented to us on this appeal is, Does a parole granted a person convicted of homicide, on condition that he pays one-fifth of his monthly salary to&nbsp; the heirs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased, which condition he complies with, bar or suspend the right of the said heirs to an action to enforce the subsidiary&nbsp; liability against the employer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; convict?<br><br>In a judgment rendered by the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Baguio in Criminal Case No. 766 affirmed by the Court of Appeals in C. A.-G. R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 10361-R, Alejandro&nbsp; Bentres was convicted of homicide committed on the person of Dagtayan Dalasdas and ordered to pay an indemnity of&nbsp; P4,000 to the heirs of the deceased.&nbsp; Execution having been issued against Bentres for the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; indemnity,&nbsp; the sheriff made a&nbsp; return containing the following statements: "'the accused has no property, either real or personal which may be levied upon" and that&nbsp; "Notice of Garnishment was served upon&nbsp; said mining&nbsp; company (Itogon Mining Company, where&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; is now employed&nbsp; as policeman) on January 28, 1954&nbsp; over the salary of the&nbsp; accused, but inspite of the lapse of time, said mining company did not answer&nbsp; our notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; garnishment."&nbsp;&nbsp; So plaintiffs,&nbsp; heirs of the deceased Dalasdas,&nbsp; presented this action against the Itogon Mining&nbsp; Company, Inc, employer of Bentres at the time and on the occasion of the homicide, upon the latter's subsidiary liability in view of the finding in the judgment of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals&nbsp; that Bentres&nbsp; "undoubtedly acted in the&nbsp; performance of a&nbsp; duty or in the lawful exercise of a&nbsp; right of office"&nbsp; (because he as policeman&nbsp; shot the deceased&nbsp; when trying to stop and arrest&nbsp; the latter whom he caught stealing&nbsp; ores from the mines&nbsp; of Itogon Mining Company, Inc.) The above&nbsp; facts appear in the Stipulation of Facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also&nbsp; appears therefrom that Alejandro Bentres was released&nbsp; on parole under Act No.&nbsp; 4103, as amended by Act No. 4225, on the condition, among others, "that he shall give&nbsp; one-fifth of his earnings during the period&nbsp; of his parole to the payment of the indemnity to which&nbsp; he&nbsp; had been&nbsp; sentenced."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; held,<br><blockquote>"* * *„&nbsp; it will be seen&nbsp; that plaintiffs have fully complied&nbsp; with all of the&nbsp; requisites of the law and their claim should be satisfied. But&nbsp; defendant has&nbsp; set up&nbsp; the defense of&nbsp; the&nbsp; conditions on&nbsp; the parole and claims that&nbsp; the effect is a suspension of the sentence, including' the portion of civil indemnity,&nbsp; and thence no&nbsp; subsidiary liability.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court is&nbsp; of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that&nbsp; this defense&nbsp; is&nbsp; not tenable.&nbsp; By final judgment, the&nbsp; accused policeman&nbsp; incurred an obligation&nbsp; of P4,000&nbsp; in favor of plaintiffs, which&nbsp; was immediately demandable."<br><br>"* * *.,&nbsp; The Parole Board&nbsp; was&nbsp; aware of the law.&nbsp; It&nbsp; knew that it could&nbsp; not touch this phase of the civil indemnity—neither&nbsp; reduce it nor change the absolute terms of its payment.&nbsp; The Parole Board was&nbsp; likewise aware,&nbsp; conclusively so, that the salary&nbsp; of the accused policeman was exempt from garnishment—and impose this condition merely as&nbsp; part of the process of&nbsp; rehabilitation to inculcate&nbsp; in the accused&nbsp; policeman a sense&nbsp; of responsibility of his obligations.&nbsp; To hold&nbsp; otherwise would result, in the final analysis, in the anomalous situation of having a novation made of a contract—the payment of the civil indemnity—without&nbsp; the consent of the creditor. A situation that our laws do not permit.&nbsp;&nbsp; From these premises, and holding that&nbsp; the civil indemnity of P4,006 is still entirely and immediately due from the accused policeman, there can be no other&nbsp; conclusion than that&nbsp; in view of his&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; insolvency, defendant is&nbsp; subsidarily&nbsp; liable."&nbsp;&nbsp; (pp. 51-52,&nbsp; Record on&nbsp; Appeal).<br></blockquote>It is&nbsp; argued&nbsp; on this appeal that as Bentres, the convict' under parole, has made payments in accordance with the condition oi the parole, the right of the heirs&nbsp; of the deceased to enforce&nbsp; payment of the&nbsp; indemnity against the Itogon&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; Inc., the party&nbsp; subsidiarily responsible,&nbsp; does not accrue or is suspended.&nbsp; We find no merit in this contention.&nbsp; In addition to the reasons given in the decision appealed from, we may add that the Parole Act contains no provision modifying the&nbsp; liability of the party subsidiarily liable for the crime committed&nbsp; by the paroled convict, or suspending such&nbsp; liability upon the grant of parole.&nbsp; We might venture to anticipate that&nbsp; a modification of such liability&nbsp; or the conditions for&nbsp; the enforcement&nbsp; thereof, without&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the offended party or his heirs to be heard, would be deprivation of property without&nbsp; due process&nbsp; of&nbsp; law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The proceedings&nbsp; leading&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; grant of&nbsp; parole&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp; entirely administrative and&nbsp; ex-parte.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the State and. the convict are parties thereto.&nbsp; They refer only to the service of the sentence.&nbsp; Neither the provisions of the law, nor the proceedings thereunder, nor the purpose and&nbsp; intent thereof purport to affect in any wise the rights of the offended party.&nbsp; How can the rights of others be affected thereby.<br><br>It is also&nbsp; argued&nbsp; that&nbsp; the return&nbsp; of the sheriff&nbsp; is not conclusive evidence of the insolvency of Bentres, the convict.&nbsp; It is at least <span style="font-style: italic;">prima fade</span>, and if it is&nbsp; claimed that he had other properties which&nbsp; could be levied upon, that fact should&nbsp; have&nbsp; been alleged&nbsp; in&nbsp; defense to the action. No such allegation exists in the answer.&nbsp; The stipulation of&nbsp; facts&nbsp; contains&nbsp; no&nbsp; such fact&nbsp; either.&nbsp; The argument must, therefore, be&nbsp; overruled.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; lastly contended&nbsp; that&nbsp; Bentres has&nbsp; so&nbsp; far paid P314.36, this evidently in compliance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; condition of the parole.&nbsp; Our&nbsp; ruling above that the&nbsp; Parole Act does not, and proceedings thereunder cannot, affect the right of the offended party to the&nbsp; subsidiary liability concludes this argument.&nbsp; If payments have been&nbsp; received&nbsp; by the offended party or his&nbsp; heirs,&nbsp; such payments may be&nbsp; deducted from the amount of the judgment on the subsidiary liability; but they may not in any manner suspend or bar the action for&nbsp; enforcement of&nbsp; said liability.<br><br>The judgment is hereby affirmed, with costs.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angela,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
