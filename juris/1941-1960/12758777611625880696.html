				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These are petitions for a writ of certiorari filed by Simeon Ayson and Maura 
Lumanlan (G. R. No. L-6501) and by Primo Arambulo (G.R. No. L-6599) to review 
the decision cf the Court of Appeals rendered in CA-GR No. 7358-R which is of 
the following tenor:
<blockquote>
<p>This action was initiated in the Court of First Instance of Tarlnc on 
December 29, 1942, by appellee Primo Arambulo, to compel Basilio Yalung to 
execute a formal and reglsterable deed of sale of the land covered by 
Certificate of Title No. 41132, replacing a private written contract executed on 
November 24, 1942. Subsequently, Basilio Yalung's sister, Paulina Yalung, was 
impleaded as party defendant for being a co-owner of the land aforesaid. 
Appellant spouses, Simeon Ayson nnd Maura Lumanlan, intervened in the 
proceedings claiming to be vendees <em>a retro</em> of the land in question for 
the price of P3,200.00, which amount was subsequently deposited by plaintiff 
with the Cleric of Court pursuant to an order of July 27, 1944. From the 
decision rendered on August 28, 1950, after reconstitution of the records, 
granting the prayer of plaintiff and declaring the repurchase effective by the 
judicial deposit, only the Intervenors have appealed. Defendants Basilio Yalung 
(substituted by his heirs) and Paulina Yalung did not appeal.</p></blockquote>
<p>The facts upon which the litigation arose are practically undisputed, and can 
be summarized, as follows:</p>
<p>On November 24, 1942, Basilio Yalung signed in Manila a private document 
selling to Primo Arambulo a 10-hectare parcel of land "of the vendor's exclusive 
ownership" in barrio Lawi, Municipality of Capas, Province of Tarlac, with 
Torrens title No. 41132, for the price of P5,000, receipt whereof was duly 
acknowledged (Exh. A-1). Shortly afterwards, the buyer entered into peaceful 
possession, purchased the tenant's house, installed a water pump and other 
improvements, and placed tenants therein.</p>
<p>Because of the seller's subsequent reluctance to formalize a registsrabls 
deea of sale and to surrender the Certificate of Title which he claimed to be 
deposited elsewhere for safekeeping, the buyer and his attorney, Victorino 
Valle, were led to investigate the land records of Tarlnc. To their surprise, 
they discovered that the Certificate of Title No. 41152 was still in the name of 
Basilia Tambengco, mother of Basilio Yalung, and his sister Paulina. Later on it 
was further ascertained that the land was originally mortgaged on December 10, 
1936 by Basilia Tambengco to herein intervenors, Simeon Ayson and Maura 
Lumanlan, of Angeles, Pampanga for P2,000.00 (Exh. 8); and that after tha 
mortgagor's death, her two children Basilio and Paulina Yalung expected another 
notarial deed (Exh. 9) on May 15, 1941, agreeing that in consideration of the 
original mortgage debt, and of the additional sum of P1,200.00, paid by the 
mortgagees, the property should be deemed sold to Ayson and Lumanlan, subject to 
a reserved right of repurchase of P3,200.00 within 4 years (i.e., not later than 
May 15, 1945). The deed was not recorded, but the duplicate. Certificate of 
Title was in possession of the vendees <em>a retro</em>.</p>
<p>In view of these unexpected developments, Arambulo and his representatives 
held various conferences with the Yalungs, and therein, as found by the Court 
below (and the finding is final on Paulina, who has not appealed), the sister 
assented tc the sale by her brother if she would be paid an additional P500.00. 
Matters dragged on, and suit was finally filed first against Basilio and later 
also against Paulina, for specific performance, and a notice of <em>lis 
pendens</em> was duly entered.</p>
<p>During the pendency of the suit, the intervenors-appellants sought a 
preliminary injunction against the appellee, claiming that they, as vendees 
<em>a retro</em>, were owners and possessors; that Basilio Yalung was only 
allowed to plant vegetables therein, and Arambulo obtained possession without 
their knowledge and consent (Rec. App. p. 26). The trial Court however denied 
the injunction (Rec. App. p. 63).</p>
<p>It appears further that in July, 1943, while the case was pending, the 
vendees <em>a retro</em> managed to record the sale in their favor, and to have 
Certificate of Title No. 41132 cancelled and replaced by Certificate No. 19408 
in their names, subject however to the <em>lis pendens</em> of appellees.</p>
<p>As the period of redemption was about to expire, plaintiff Arambulo on May 
10, 1944 asked the Court to order the intervenors to allow the plaintiff to 
repurchase the land and to pay P500.00 to Paulina Yalung (Rec. App. p. 95); and 
after various pleadings the Court entered an order as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is a motion filed by counsel for the plaintiff herein in which he prays 
that he be allowed to repurchase from the intervenors the land in litigation by 
paying to them the sum of P3,200 at which it should be resold by them, according 
to their contract with the defendants; and that he be likewise allowed to 
consign in this court the amount of P500 which is averred by defendant Basilio 
Yalung to be the money value of the participation therein of defendant Paulina 
Yalung.</p>
<p>"To this motion the other parties herein formally objected. But at its 
hearing the intervenors withdrew their opposition thereto upon condition that 
the two sums aforementioned would be consigned in this court. The defendants 
likewise withdrew their objection provided that their withdrawal thereof should 
not be understood as a recognition of plaintiff's right to repurchase that 
property from the intervenors.</p>
<p>After due consideration of this matter, taking into account the fact that the 
period within which the repurchase thereof from the intervenors continues to run 
notwithstanding the filing of this action; that it is necessary that the running 
of the said period be tolled or suspended pending the final determination of the 
issues raised herein, the court has come to the conclusion that, in the interest 
of the administration of justice, the motion aforementioned should be 
granted.</p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, plaintiff is hereby ALLOWED and AUTHORIZED to repurchase from the 
intervenors ths land in controversy by racking a consignation in this court of 
the amount of P3,200, and to offer the payment of P500 to plaintiff Paulina 
Yalung by likewise consigning the said sum. This authorization, however, shall 
not be understood as a resolution on the issues raised by the parties herein but 
witnout prejudice to the plaintiff and to the defendants' continuing to litigate 
the controversy between them.</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED." (Rec. App. pp. 102-104)</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of this order, plaintiff Arambulo remitted the amount of P3,700.00 to 
the Clerk of Court by a cashier's check of the Philippine National Bank and a 
money order for the Clerk's deposit fees of P18.50 (Exhs. V and W), with a 
request that the intervenors and Paulina Yalung be notified thereof.</p>
<p>In its decision on the merits, the Court below ultimately ordered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court renders judgment to the following 
effect:</p>
<p>"a. Dismissing plaintiff's action for specific performance against 
defendants, as well as his action for money claims against defendant Basilio 
Yalung.</p>
<p>"b. Dismissing intervenors' claim for indemnity and damages against 
plaintiff.</p>
<p>"c. Declaring plaintiff absolute owner of the whole of the land in Question 
by virtue of the constructive repurchase of the said land in question from the 
intervenors.</p>
<p>"d. Ordering the Register of Leeds of Tarlac to cancel Transfer Certificate 
of Title No. 19408, and issue in lieu thereof a transfer certificate of title in 
the names of the plaintiff Primo Arambulo ana his spouse. Loreta Sevilla de 
Arambulo; the property here in Question having been acquired by the said spouses 
as conjugal property.</p>
<p>"The Court makes no special pronouncement as to costs."</p>
<p>"SO ORDERED." (Rec. App., pp. 152-153)</p></blockquote>
<p>From this decision the intervenors, Ayson and Lumanlan, duly appealed to this 
Court, making four assignments of error.</p>
<p>Under the first assignment, it is contended that the execution of the 
notarial deed of sale <em>a retro</em>, Exhibit 9, constituted symbolic delivery 
of the land sold to tne intervenors-appellants, who should be regarded as having 
acquired title and possession of land in dispute as of May 15, 1941, when said 
Exhibit was ratified, This argument is not tenable, because the land object of 
the contract was covered by a Torrens Title, and sec. 50 of Act 496 is very 
clear that "no deed xxx purporting to convey or affect registered land, shall 
take effect as a conveyance or bind the land" until actually registered, and 
"the act of registration shall be the operative act to convey and affect the 
land." "In accordance with this section," said the Supreme Court in Tuason 
<em>vs</em>. Raymundo, 28 Phil. 635, 637, "no act of the parties themselves can 
transfer the ownership of real estate under the Torrens system. That is done by 
the act of registration of the conveyance which the parties have made."</p>
<p>The deed Exhibit 9 not having been recorded until 1943, It did not transfer 
to the appellants any ownership or real right of possession before the land was 
sold to appellee. The provisions of the Civil Code regarding passing of title 
upon delivery by execution of public instrument (old Civ. Code., art. 1462) must 
be deemed modified by the provisions of Act 496 in so far as registered land is 
concerned.</p>
<p>It follows from the foregoing considerations that when the appellee purchased 
the land in 1942 from Basilio Yalung and physically entered the lot, introduced 
improvements and worked on it, he becaue a possessor in good faith, as held by 
the Court below. It is undeniable from the evidence that the appellee did not 
suspect at the tiae that thp iand was already sold to intervenors-appellants, 
whose deed was not recorded; nor did he invade any possessory right of said 
parting, since they were not in possession, actually or legally, The 
intervenors-appellants therefore are not entitled to the damages they claim 
under their third assignment of error, inasmuch as the appellee committed no act 
of dispossession concerning then.</p>
<p>The subsequent registration of the <em>pacto de retro</em> sale in 1943 did 
not improve the position of the appellants as against the appellee, for the 
reason that the registration of their right was made subject to the <em>lis 
pendens</em> notice recorded in behalf of the herein appellee.</p>
<p>The claim that the possession in good faith of the plaintiff-appellee ceased 
at all events when he learned of the <em>pacto de retro</em> sale in favor of 
+hs appellant-intervenors, must be disallowed. First, because as already pointed 
out, the sale to intervenors not having been recorded, the same did not confer 
possession in them, and therefore, the deed of sale in their favor was not a 
defect that invalidated the possession of the plaintiff Arambulo; and Article 
433 of the old Civil Code makes good faith depend upon ignorance of a flaw that, 
invalidates the title to the possession. Secondly, because there being no 
registration of the deed in favor of the intervenors, nor of the one in favor of 
the plaintiff, the latter was entitled to preference as prior actual (physical) 
possessor (old Civil Code, Art. 1473, p. 3, first part). In the third place, the 
appellants-intervenors expressly admitted having allowed Basilio Yalung to 
remain in possession, and this right, of possession was transferred to 
plaintiff. Their allegation that Yalung was only given a possession at will, 
terminable at their discretion, was not adequately proved.</p>
<p>It is urged in appellants' fourth assignment of error that appellee should be 
awarded only one-half of the land, because no sale in his favor was made by 
Paulina Yalung. The Court below, however, expressly found that Paulina ratified 
the sale to the plaintiff of the whole land, upon payment of P500.00 
subsequently deposited in Court; and Paulina Yalung not having appealed from 
this finding, it is conclusive upon her and appellants can no longer question 
the fact, since they are not parties to the contract and transactions had 
between Arambulo and the Yalungs. It is elementary that the annulment of a 
contract can only be asked by those who are parties thereto, principally or 
subsidiarily (old Civ. Code, Art. 1302; new Civil Code, Art. 1397; Wolfson 
<em>vs</em>. Martinez, 20 Phil, 340; Martell 0ng <em>vs</em>. Jariol, 17 Phil. 
244). </p>
<p>The same consideration bars these appellants from invoking the Statute of 
Frauds against the conveyance by Paulina Yalung, based on the absence of a 
sufficient written memorandum. In the first place, it nowhere appears on the 
record that Paulina ever invoked the Statute as a defense, before or after 
trial; and in the secona piece, the defense of noncompliance with the Statute 
can not be invoked by strangers to the oral contract (49 Am. Jur. p. 896, et 
seq.)</p>
<p>There remains the question whether the consignation in Court of the 
redemption price of P3,200 pursuant to the order of July 27, 1944 was a valid 
one, and amounted to a repurchase. In their second assignment of error, 
appellants assail such consignation on the theory that it did not comply with 
the legal requisites, because (1) the deposit was by check and not in legal 
tender; (2) it lacked P18.50, the Clerk's fees (which was subsequently remitted 
by money order, Exh, W); and (3) no notice was given to the creditors.</p>
<p>It was proved that thc P3,700.00 (including the P500.00 for Paulina Yalung 
who has not appealed) was remitted to the Clerk of Court in the form of a 
Philippine National Bank Cashier's Check No. 57862 (Exh. V) hence, the 
consignation must be deemed invalid, since the law requires that it should 
follow the rules of payment, and one of those is that payment should be made in 
legal tender (Cuaycong <em>vs</em>. Rius, L-333, April 21, 1950; Villanueva 
<em>vs</em>. Santos, Off. Gaz., March 8, 1941, p. 681). We do not believe that 
the letter of the Clerk of Court (Exh. V) informing the counsel for plaintiff of 
his receipt of the oheck, and of the fact that "the amount of P18.50 
representing the commission of this office was abducted from the sum of 
P3,700.00 which was sent by you to this office through the Philippine Notional 
Bank of Tarlac," constitutes proof that the check was actually cashed by the 
clerk, as found, by the Court below, "for otherwise he could not have deducted 
the sum of P18.50 representing his commission" (Rec. App. p. 142); the Clerk 
there evidently meant that plaintiff could not, bc creditea with a deposit of 
P3,700.00 but only of P3,681.50. The "was deducted" could have been done in the 
account books of the Clerk of Court.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that the actual payment of the repurchase money can 
not be deemed legally made at the time the deposit was made. On the other hand, 
the pendency of the suit prevented a consolidation of the title for 
non-redemption (Ong Chua <em>vs</em>. Carr, 53 Phil. 975).</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is modified and 
plaintiff-appellant is given thirty (30) days from the time final judgment is 
entered, to pay the appellants P3,200.00 in legal tender; whereupon, appellants 
shall execute a proper deed of reconveyance of the land in question to the 
appellee, without costs in this instance.</p>
<p>In G. R. No. L-6501 the petitioners contend that (1) the Court of appeals 
erred in holding that the sale of a parcel of land with a right reserved by the 
vendors to repurchase it executed on 15 May 1941 in favor of the vendees <em>a 
retro</em> and registered only in July 1943 was subject to a notice of <em>lis 
pendens</em> caused to be recorded on 29 December 1942 in the registry of deeds 
of Tarlac by Primo Arambulo on the Torrens certificate of title of the parcel of 
land sold <em>a retro</em> to the a (petitioners), arising from an action for 
specific performance brought in the Court of First Instance of Tarlac by Primo 
ioruubulo against Basllio T. Yalung et al. (civil case No. 7); (2) the Court of 
appeals erred in holding that the recorded notice of <em>lis pendens</em> 
against the share in a parcel of land of a co-owner who sold it subjected also 
that of the other co-owner who did not sell hers; (3) the Court of Appeals erred 
in holding that the defense based on the statute of frauds that may be set up by 
a co-owner is personal and may not be availed of by them (petitioners) who claim 
to be the successors-in-lnterest of said co-owner; (4) the Court of Appeals 
erred in holding that Primo Arambulo continued to be a possessor in good faith 
after he had found out that the vendor of the parcel of land owned only one-half 
thereof and that the owners of the parcel of land had sold it to them 
(petitioners); (5) the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the commencement 
of the action for specific performance referred to prevented the consolidation 
of the title to the parcel of land in their (petitioners') favor; and (6) the 
Court of Appeals erred in not awarding them (petitioners) the sum of P1,000 a 
year as damages until the end of the litigation as prayed for by them in their 
complaint in intervention.</p>
<p>In G. R. No. L-6599 the petitioner claims that the deposit or consignation 
made by him in court of the sum of money to repurchase the parcel of land from 
the vendees <em>a retro</em>, the intervenors in the court of first instance, in 
compliance with its order entered on 27 July. 1944, is valid and releases it 
from the lien of the vendees <em>a retro</em>.</p>
<p>Let us take up the question raised by the petitioner in the last mentioned 
case. Despite the fact that the plaintiff in tne court of first instance, 
appellee in the Court of Appeals and petitioner herein, upon his petition, was 
authorized by the trial court to deposit in court the sum of P3,200 owed to the 
vendees <em>a retro</em>, the. intervenors in the court of first instance, 
appellants in the Court of Appeals and petitioners in G. R. No. L-6501, together 
with the sum of P500 which Paulina Yalung was agreeable and willing to accept as 
the consideration or price for the conveyance of her share in the parcel of land 
to Primo Arambulo, to forestall the consolidation of title to the parcel of land 
upon expiration of the period stipulated for the repurchase of the property from 
the vendees <em>a retro</em>, intervenors in the court of first instance; that 
the sum deposited by the plaintiff as authorized by the trial court was made by 
means of a manager's check; that from all indications the clerk of court cashed 
or collected it from the Tarlac branch of the Philippine National Bank and de 
posited it in the provincial treasury to pay not only the sum of P3,200 
stipulated for ths repurchase of the parcel of land from the vendees <em>a 
retro</em> but also the price of the other half thereof belonging to Paulina 
Yalung, still the provisions of the law on consignation have not been complied 
with, as correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, because no notice of such 
deposit made in court was served upon the. vendee <em>a retro</em>, intervenors 
in the court of first instance, appellants in the Court of appeals and 
petitioners in G.R. No, L-6501, as required by article 1178 of the Civil 
Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Notice of the deposit made by the 
obligor or debtor to the obligees or creditors was necessary to protect their 
interrest. As soon as they were notified of the deposit they might pray the 
court to allow them to withdraw the amount deposited; but no such step could be 
taken by them without the knowledge that the deposit had been made.</p>
<p>Let us now take up the points raised by the petitioners in G. R. No. L-6501, 
The notice of <em>lis pendens</em> caused to be recorded by the petitioner in G. 
R. No. L-6599 subjected the parcel of land to the result of the litigation, As 
aptly stated by the Court of Appeals the registration of the deed of sale of a 
parcel of land registered under the Torrens System with a right reserved by the 
vendors to repurchase it was the operative act of conveying and affecting the 
parcel of land sold. By their unrecorded contract of sale with a right to 
repurchase the vendees <em>a retro</em> could bind the vendors <em>a retro</em> 
but not third parties who were not aware of such contract. The notice of <em>lis 
pendens</em> recorded on the certificate of title of the parcel of land did not 
deprive the vendees <em>a retro</em> of their right to the same. It only meant 
that if the plaintiff, the purchaser of the parcel of land, should secure a 
judgment in his favor, he would step into the shoes of the vendors who had 
reserved the right to repurchase the parcel of land from the vendees <em>a 
retro</em> within the stipulated period.</p>
<p>The second and third points raised by the petitioners are meritless, because 
as found by the Court of Appeals Paulina Yalung, the owner of an undivided half 
share in the parcel of land sold by her brother Basilio T. Yalung, was 
agreeable, and willing to transfer and oonvey her share to Primo Arambulo for 
and in consideration of P500. The predecessor-in-interest of the vendees <em>a 
retro</em> having waived her right to object to the conveyance of her share on 
the ground of lack of a written memorandum, the vendees <em>a retro</em>, her 
successors-in-interest, cannot invoke the statute of frauds waived by their 
predecessor-in-interest.</p>
<p>The claim that the vendee Primo Arambulo could not be deemed a possessor in 
good faith of the parcel of land after finding out that the one who had sold it 
to him owned only one-half thereof and that on 15 May 1941 the vendor and her 
sister had sold the same parcel of land to the vendees <em>a retro,</em> is 
unmeritorious. Such finding subsequent to the purchase of the parcel of land 
made by Primo Arambulo cannot make or convert him into a possessor in bad faith 
of the same, because he tried to compel the part owner who had sold him the 
parcel of land to legalize the sale and succeeded in having the co-owner sell 
her share to him for and in consideration of P500.</p>
<p>The contention that the title to the parcel of land was consolidated in the 
vendees <em>a retro</em> is without foundation in law, because although the 
deposit or consignation was invalid, yet a period of thirty days is granted to 
the vendors <em>a retro</em> or their successor-in-interest "from the time final 
judgment was rendered in a civil action on the basis that the contract was a 
true sale with the right to repurchase, "<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> within which to exercise the right to 
repurchase. And the application of the provisions of article 1606 of the new 
Civil Code is authorized by article 2253 of the same Code. The right of the 
vendees <em>a retro</em> to consolidate title to the parcel of land sold to them 
hinges on the invalidity of the consignation made by the successor-in-interest 
of the vendors <em>a retro</em> to repurchase the parcel of land, and such 
invalidity is not final until after the judgment declaring it invalid becomes 
final and executory.</p>
<p>The judgment under review is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
