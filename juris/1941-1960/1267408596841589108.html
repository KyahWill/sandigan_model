				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review an order of execution by the respondent judge 
issued after the record on appeal was submitted but before it was approved. The 
cause is one over the possession and ownership of a house and lot, and the 
judgment of the court below declares "the plaintiff absolute owner of the 
properties described in the complaint and ordered the defendants to restore its 
possession to the former."
<p>The first ground of attack is grave abuse of discretion. The allegations in 
the pleadings and the facts disclosed thereby do not sustain the charge. These 
allegations and these facts, so far from showing an abuse of discretion on the 
part of the court, satisfy us that there is a good reason for the execution and 
that the court made proper use of its judgment. Far from acting arbitrarily or 
capriciously, the respondent judge appears to have exercised his discretion with 
discrimination and deliberation, ordering, before he decided the motion, an 
ocular inspection of the house and a report on the condition thereof. The result 
of the inspection and other factors reasonably warrant, in our opinion, the 
lower court's order as a suitable measure to preserve the building and protect 
the interests of the parties.</p>
<p>The petitioners would have Section 9 of Rule 72 of the Rules of Court applied 
to this case. That Rule refers to the stay of execution in cases of forcible 
entry and detainer. The applicable Rule is Section 2 of Rule 39. There is no 
warrant for treating the present case on the same level as a possessory action, 
as petitioners urge. The parity which is said to exist between the two cases is 
outweighed by the disparity. Among other differences, we may mention the fact 
that in a forcible entry and detainer case the rights of the plaintiff are 
protected by the continued payment of the rents; in the instant case, no damage 
or compensation for the use of the house is provided in the decision. In a 
possessory action, the owner of the house retains the right to make repairs that 
are necessary for its proper preservation; in the present case, the plaintiff is 
not at liberty to do that. A supersedeas bond is good only "for the performance 
of the judgment or order appealed from in case it be affirmed." It does not 
cover damage caused to the property during the pendency of the appeal. The right 
of the defendant in an ordinary action to stay execution has to be rested on the 
general principles of law in relation to the peculiar circumstances of the 
case.</p>
<p>The petitioners question the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to 
issue execution after the submission of the record on appeal. They maintain that 
after the record on appeal is presented, and even though it has not been 
approved, the court loses jurisdiction over the cause. Neither reason nor 
authority supports this view. The construction which the petitioners put on 
Section 2 of Rule 39 would place it within the power of a losing party to 
nullify the authority of the court to order execution pending appeal. If the 
mere presentation of the record on appeal could prevent the execution of the 
judgment, the defeated party, to forestall that contingency, could file his 
notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on appeal, in any form or manner, 
immediately after the decision is promulgated, or, at the latest, before the 
other party has had time to prepare a motion for execution and to put it in 
shape to be acted upon by the court. For the rest, the Rule specifically allows 
the granting of execution, for good reason, before the expiration of the time to 
appeal. It does not say, by express terms or implication, that execution may not 
issue under any circumstance after the record on appeal has been perfected.</p>
<p>The petitioners invite attention to the provision in Section 2 of Rule 39, 
that the order for execution shall be included in the record on appeal, and 
reason that this requirement could not be fulfilled if execution be issued after 
the filing of the record on appeal. But the incorporation of the order of 
execution into the record on appeal is not indispensable in all cases. The Rule 
makes it clear that inclusion has to be done only when the issuance of the order 
of execution precedes the presentation of the record on appeal. This particular 
provision, by the way, is one more argument for the theory that the time within 
which the court is authorized to have the judgment executed is the time 
prescribed for appeal irrespective of the filing of the record on appeal, 
provided only that the record on appeal has not been approved. It is the 
approval of the record on appeal that removes the case from the trial court's 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The petition is denied with costs against the petitioners.</p><i>Paras, 
Pablo, Perfecto,</i> and <i>Bengzon, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
