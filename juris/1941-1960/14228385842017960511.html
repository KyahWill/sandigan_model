				G.R. No. L-9225, August 21, 1957</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER  OF THE PETITION OF RAMON  TING ALIAS  TING TIAN YU TO BE ADMITTED A  CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER  AND APPELLEE, VS.  REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR  AND APPELLANT.</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Government is appealing from the decision of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Cebu,&nbsp; granting the petition for naturalization filed by&nbsp; Ramon&nbsp; Ting <i>alias</i> Ting&nbsp; Tian Yu.<br><br>The appellant did not file any opposition to the petition for naturalization, but an&nbsp; assistant provincial&nbsp; fiscal appeared during the hearing and cross examined the "witnesses for the&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp; According to the&nbsp; evidence and the findings&nbsp; of the lower court, the petitioner, born in China of Chinese parents in the year 1914, came to the Philippines about the middle&nbsp; of March&nbsp; 1920,&nbsp; and had continuously resided here up to the date&nbsp; of the hearing, except when in 1925, he and&nbsp; his father went to China for&nbsp; a six months visit; that he finished&nbsp; the&nbsp; high school&nbsp; course offered&nbsp; by the Southern&nbsp; Colleges, now known as the&nbsp; University of Southern Philippines,&nbsp; Cebu City, graduating&nbsp; therefrom in 1937; that&nbsp; in 1938, he&nbsp; married Conchita Tan&nbsp; alias Tan Ching Tee,&nbsp; daughter&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; Chinese father&nbsp; married&nbsp; to&nbsp; a Filipina; that his two children,&nbsp; Erlinda Ting and Teodoro Ting, both studied in&nbsp; the San Jose College&nbsp; of Cebu; and that petitioner is a sales agent and bookkeeper of the Hua Kiong Trading of Cebu and at the same time kept the books for other stores, receiving a total income of P3,000.00 a&nbsp; year. The&nbsp; trial court found&nbsp; that during, his long stay&nbsp; in the Philippines, petitioner has&nbsp; observed&nbsp; good&nbsp; conduct and has maintained excellent relations with the Government authorities as well&nbsp; as with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Filipinos; that he has never been accused of any&nbsp; crime or offense and has paid his taxes; and that he does not possess any of the disqualifications&nbsp; for&nbsp; naturalization but&nbsp; on the other&nbsp; hand has the&nbsp; qualifications required by&nbsp; law.<br><br>The Government, however, claims that&nbsp; the petitioner failed&nbsp; to comply&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; naturalization&nbsp; law requiring the filing of a declaration of intention to become a citizen, because&nbsp; although&nbsp; he may have come&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Philippines in 1920,&nbsp; nevertheless,&nbsp; he absented himself by&nbsp; going back to China in 1925, and although he returned to the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; after&nbsp; six&nbsp; months,&nbsp; the continuous&nbsp; residence&nbsp; of thirty&nbsp; years required&nbsp; by law for&nbsp; exemption from the duty of&nbsp; riling the aforementioned declaration should&nbsp; be computed from that year, 1925, in which case,&nbsp; when&nbsp; he filed his&nbsp; petition for naturalization on December&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 1950, his continuous&nbsp; residence was only about twenty-five&nbsp; years. We do not believe that a&nbsp; short absence from the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; such as the visit made by the petitioner to&nbsp; China for a&nbsp; period of six&nbsp; months in 1925, should&nbsp; be held to interrupt his residence begun in 1920.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Leon&nbsp; Miranda&nbsp; Tio Liok <i>vs.&nbsp;</i> Republic of the Philippines, G. R. No. L-4545, October 29, 1952, we&nbsp; held that absence of short duration from the&nbsp; Philippines did not interrupt or affect the continuous residence of thirty years required by&nbsp; law for exemption from&nbsp; the duty to file a&nbsp; declaration of intention.&nbsp; We said:<br><blockquote>* * * "But we find that petitioner is&nbsp; exempt&nbsp; from filing such declaration of intention it appearing from the evidence that he&nbsp; has continuously resided&nbsp; in the Philippines&nbsp; for over thirty years with the exception of&nbsp; two, instances when he went to&nbsp; China for short visits (Exhibit A, pp. 34-35)," * * *<br></blockquote>The appellant also expresses the opinion that the trial court erred in allowing a witness to testify for the petitioner when said&nbsp; witness&nbsp; was not one&nbsp; of&nbsp; those&nbsp; mentioned as a character&nbsp; witness&nbsp; in&nbsp; the petition, and&nbsp; there was no&nbsp; reason&nbsp; given&nbsp; why the character&nbsp; witness so mentioned in the petition, Uldarieo Alviola, was not presented in court to testify, but that the other witness was allowed to&nbsp; testify&nbsp; in his&nbsp; place.&nbsp; We are&nbsp; afraid that&nbsp; counsel of the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; is&nbsp; laboring&nbsp; under a misapprehension or&nbsp; mistake.&nbsp; The other witness,&nbsp; Conrado Costanilla, was presented&nbsp; only as a corroborative&nbsp; witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact,&nbsp; Uldarico Alviola actually testified and was even cross-examined by the&nbsp; assistant fiscal, but&nbsp; inasmuch as he testified in Spanish, another stenographer was utilized to take&nbsp; down&nbsp; his testimony,&nbsp; resulting&nbsp; in&nbsp; two separate transcripts of the stenographic notes taken, one by stenographer Gregorio Maureal, who took down the&nbsp; testimonies of all the witnesses, except Uldarico&nbsp; Alviola&nbsp; whose testimony was taken down by stenographer Candido&nbsp; Jumapao.&nbsp; Appellant's counsel presumably overlooked the second transcript.<br><br>In view of the foregoing,&nbsp; the decision appealed from is hereby&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
