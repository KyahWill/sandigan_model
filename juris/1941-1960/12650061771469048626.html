				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">The plaintiff-appellee filed an action against the&nbsp; defendant-appellant&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Eizal&nbsp; for the collection of a sum of money.&nbsp; The trial was set&nbsp; for October 1, 1951, notice of&nbsp; which&nbsp; was served upon counsel for appellant on&nbsp; September 24, 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day Attys. Tirona&nbsp; and Navarro,&nbsp; counsel for appellant, filed an&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte </span>urgent&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for postponement (signed by Atty. Navarro) based&nbsp; on the ground that counsel&nbsp; had a case in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Manila set for&nbsp; hearing for the same day.&nbsp;&nbsp; On October&nbsp; 1&nbsp; neither&nbsp; the appellant nor his counsel&nbsp; appeared,&nbsp; whereupon the court denied&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; for postponement&nbsp; and proceeded to&nbsp; receive&nbsp; the evidence presented&nbsp; by the appellee,&nbsp; and accordingly&nbsp; to render a decision in&nbsp; appellee's favor.&nbsp; A motion&nbsp; (signed by Atty. Tirona) was filed to set aside said decision and for a new trial, and&nbsp; as the same was denied the&nbsp; present appeal was interposed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant.<p>The latter, in assailing the action taken by the trial court, argues that&nbsp; early&nbsp; action&nbsp; should have been taken by it on the&nbsp; motion for postponement so that in case of denial,&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for appellant could act accordingly;&nbsp; that at any rate&nbsp; no&nbsp; prejudice would&nbsp; be caused&nbsp; to any of&nbsp; the parties by&nbsp; its&nbsp; granting whereas its denial on the very day of the trial in&nbsp; effect deprived the&nbsp; appellant of his day in court.</p><p>We&nbsp; are of the opinion that&nbsp; appellant's position is well. taken.&nbsp; The motion for postponement, which was the first, was filed several days before the trial.&nbsp; While attorneys should not assume that&nbsp; a motion for postponement would be&nbsp; granted, they are none the less entitled to&nbsp; a timely notice of its denial,&nbsp; to know&nbsp; what to do to protect the interest of&nbsp; their client, it being the business&nbsp; or concern of&nbsp; the law&nbsp; office representing the party&nbsp; (and not for the court to assume) to determine whether&nbsp; one or the other of two or more partners can handle the trial.&nbsp; It is noteworthy, in&nbsp; this connection, that the&nbsp; answer sets up the defenses of partial payment and the fact that the appellant was a mere accomodation party which,&nbsp; if proven, would. naturally alter the appealed&nbsp; decision.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; decision&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside and the case remanded&nbsp; to the lower court for a&nbsp; new trial and corresponding judgment</p><p>So ordered, without&nbsp; costs.</p><p><em>Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A,, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
