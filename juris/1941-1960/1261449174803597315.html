				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present appeal was interposed by the City Attorney of Quezon City from 
the order of the Court of First Instance dated December 8, 1953, dismissing the 
case against Amada Reyes de Hernandez, Ricardo and Teofilo Reyes, and Solano 
Hernandez.
<p>It appears from the record that on April 24, 1953, an information for 
qualified theft was filed in the Court of First Instance of Quezon City (Case 
No. Q-972), couched in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned City Attorney of Quezon City accuses Anselmo Reyes y Barican 
as principal, and accused Amada Reyes de Hernandez, Solano Hernandez, Ricardo 
Reyes, Teofilo Reyes and others who are still unidentified as accessories after 
the fact of the crime of qualified theft, committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'That on or about the 19th of April, 1953, in Quezon City, Philippines, the 
accused Anselmo Reyes Y Barican, who at the time was then the trusted driver of 
Mr. and Mrs. Lucas Paredes and has been especially assigned to take charge and 
drive a Cadillac car for the Governor of Abra wherein the jewelries belonging to 
Mr. and Mrs. Paredes were being kept and while said car was under the care and 
custody of Anselmo Reyes y Barican, said accused, without the consent of the 
owner thereof, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, with 
intent of gain and with grave abuse of confidence, open the baggage compartment 
of said Cadillac car and take, steal, and carry away the following jewelries 
belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Lucas Paredes:</p>
<p>'(List of Jewelries)</p></blockquote>
<p>"That the accused Amada Reyes de Hernandez, Solano Hernandez, Ricardo Reyes 
and Teofilo Reyes, having knowledge of the commission of the above described 
crime of qualified theft, and without having participated therein either as 
principals or as accomplices took part in said offense subsequent to its 
commission by then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously concealing 
the aforementioned pieces of jewelry after receiving same from the principal 
accused Anselmo Reyes y Barican, in order to conceal the crime, to the damage 
and prejudice of the said owners thereof in the aforementioned sum of P227,190, 
Philippine currency." (Appellant's Brief, pp. 2-3).</p></blockquote>
<p>The principal accused, Anselmo Reyes, pleaded guilty to simple theft, and was 
sentenced accordingly. Those charged as accessories after the fact (now 
appellees herein) pleaded not guilty, and later filed a motion to quash (Rec., 
p. 58) on the ground that being brothers and sisters of the accused, they were 
exempt of criminal responsibility for the acts charged against them in the 
information, invoking Art. 20 of the Revised Penal Code and submitting evidence 
of the relationship. Thereupon, the prosecution moved (Rec. p. 77) to be allowed 
to clarify the information by adding thereto an allegation that the accused 
Ricardo, Teofilo, and Amada Reyes, and the latter's husband Solano Hernandez, 
<em>profited</em> from the effects of the crime committed by the principal 
accused. In view of this move, counsel for the accused moved to withdraw their 
motion to quash, and objected to the proposed amendment of the information, on 
the ground that it was a material change not allowable after plea without 
consent of the accused (Rec, pp. 79, 86). , On June 15, 1953, the Court issued 
an order denying the motion to amend the information, because it would 
substantially affect the fundamental rights of the accused, who were exempt from 
criminal responsibility under the original information, in view of their 
relationship with the principal accused (Rec, p. 102), but without acting on* 
the motion for the withdrawal of the motion to quash. Then the prosecution. 
moved to dismiss the case against the alleged accessories, with reservation of 
the right to file another information; and the court ordered the dismissal on 
August 26, 1953 (Rec. p. 155), without ruling on the reservation made by the 
prosecution because any such ruling would be, in its opinion, premature.</p>
<p>A new information was then filed (Crim. Case No. Q-1064) in the same Court, 
virtually reproducing the pre- vious one in case Q-972, except for the 
allegation thatâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Amada Reyes de Hernandez, Solano Hernandez, Ricardo Reyes and Teofilo Reyes 
received the following pieces of jewelry and with intent of gain willfully 
unlawfully and feloniously kept them for the purpose of profiting themselves and 
assisting Anselmo Reyes to profit by the effects of the crime above mentioned to 
the damage and prejudice of the above-mentioned owner in the sum of P162,180 
Philippine currency. * * *".</p></blockquote>
<p>The accused moved to quash the second information on the ground that it would 
place them twice in jeopardy for the same offense; and the motion was granted by 
the Court below. Thereupon, the prosecution appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General argues that there could be no second jeopardy for the 
accused because (1) they could not be convicted under the first information, in 
view of their relationship with the accused; and (2) that the second information 
requires evidence (of intent of gain) that could not be admitted under the first 
information, since it charged merely intent to conceal the crime.</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the plea of double jeopardy was erroneously 
sustained. In the first place, the accused- appellees herein filed a motion to 
quash on the ground that tney incurred no criminal liability under the facts 
alleged in the information in the preceding case, No. Q-972, and the trial 
Court, instead of allowing the withdrawal of the motion to quash, virtually 
sustained the same when it denied the fiscal's motion to amend, thereby forcing 
the latter to dismiss the case; hence, it can not be held that the former case 
was terminated without the express consent of the accused. Secondly, the 
defendants themselves showed that the information in case No. Q-972 was 
insufficient to charge them with any criminal offense, in view of their 
relationship with the principal accused; and it is well established doctrine 
that for jeopardy to attach, there must be an information sufficient in form and 
substance to sustain a conviction (Rule 113, sec. 9). Lastly, the herein accused 
having successfully contended that the information in case No. Q-972 was 
insufficient to sustain a conviction, they can not turn around now and claim 
that such information was after all, sufficient and did place them in danger or 
jeopardy of being convicted thereunder. If, as they formerly contended, no 
conviction could be had in the previous case, they are in estoppel to contend 
now that the information in the second case (Q-1064) places them in jeopardy for 
the <em>second</em> time. Their case comes within the spirit of the rule laid 
down in People <em>vs</em>. Acierto, (92 Phil., 534):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Irrespective of the correctness of the views of tbe Military authorities, 
the defendant was estopped from demurring to the Philippine court's jurisdiction 
and pleading double jeopardy on the strength of his <em>trial by the court 
martial. A party will not be allowed to make a mockery of justice by taking 
inconsistent positions which</em>, if allowed, <em>would result in brazen 
deception</em>. It is trifling with the courts, contrary to the elementary 
principles of the right dealing and good faith, for an accused to tell one court 
that it lacks authority to try him and, after he has succeeded in his effort, to 
tell the court to which he has been turned over that the first has committed 
error in yielding to his plea." (Italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>The order of dismissal appealed from is reversed and set aside, and the case 
ordered remanded to the Court of origin with instructions to proceed with the 
case. Costs against accused-appellees.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
