				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On March 21, 1948, Moros Lambayong and Amsia were paid passengers 
in bus No. 24, bearing TPU plate No. 7629, and belonging to the Guinoo 
Transportation Company, on its return trip from Digos to Davao City.  
When said bus came to kilometer 44, it capsized on the road, as a result
 of which Lambayong died and Amsia suffered physical injuries Amsia, 
Ampang and Lumpitan instituted the present action in the Court of First 
Instance of Davao, to recover from the Guinoo Transportation Company and
 its manager, Vicente Guinoo, P2,000.00 as damages for the death of 
Lambayong and P1,000.00 as damages suffered by Amsia for the physical 
injuries.  After hearing, the court dismissed the complaint on the 
following grounds: "Sin embargo, del contenido de la declaracion jurada 
suscrita por Amsia Puna y Lumpitan Dumingay se infiere claramente, que 
el accidente que causo la muerte de Lambayong, las lessiones causadas en
 la persona de Amsia, y la imposibilidad de los pasajeros de llegar a su
 destino, se debio' a un caso forfuito que estaba fuera del alcance de 
los demandados y del chofer Quirino Piezas." The plaintiffs have 
appealed.
  <p>    It appears that the case was submitted for decision practically
 on the pleadings and the meager stipulation of facts entered into by 
the parties in open court, without any attempt on the part of the 
plaintiffs to show by proper evidence that the accident in question was 
due to any fault of the defendants' driver, and not to a fortuitous 
event.  Upon the other hand, the records show that, as a result of the 
accident, a criminal case was filed in the Justice of the Peace Court of
 Sta. Cruz against the driver, Quirino Piezas, but said case was 
dismissed upon the joint affidavit of Amsia and Lumpitan.  This 
affidavit was presented in evidence and the lower court based its 
decision mainly thereon.  In said affidavit Amsia and Lumpitan declared 
as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"That as the HABACCO bus No. 39 was overtaking the QUITRANCO bus 
we felt that the HABACCO bus struck the QUITRANCO bus somewhere on its 
left side, thus suddenly pushing the said QUITRANCO bus toward the canal
 on the right side of the road, and the driver of the QUITRANCO bus 
swerved the truck to the left in order to prevent the truck from falling
 into the canal, and striking a tree standing on the side of the road, 
and the HABACCO bus which was running very fast proceeded on its way.</p>
    <p>"Then when the driver of the truck of the QUITRANCO suddenly 
swerved the truck to the left in order to prevent it from falling to the
 canal and striking a tree on the side of the road, the truck skidded, 
thereby turning the truck upside down and as a result of which we 
suffered injuries including Lamayong Mantuching who later died because 
of the injuries she received."</p>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It is obvious from these statements that the accident could not be 
attributed in any manner to any fault or omission of the defendants' 
driver.  Of course, it is now pretended by counsel for the appellants 
that "After investigation made by the PC officers and policemen in 
charge of the case, the negligence imputed to the driver of the HABACCO 
truck No. 39 was found not true, because no sign or mark of any 
collision was found on said two trucks and the driver of the Habacco 
truck and the passengers of said two trucks denied that any such 
collision has ever taken place." However, this allegation cannot be 
given any weight, there being nothing in the record to sustain it.  Upon
 the other hand, the affidavit of Amsia and Lumpitan was introduced at 
the hearing without any objection from counsel for appellants.</p>
  <p>    It is urged for the appellants that the appellees are liable 
under their contract as transport safely passengers Lambayong and Amsia 
to their destination, regardless of any fault or negligence that cause 
the accident, reliance being placed on the case of Lasam vs. Smith, 45 
Phil. 657.  This authority, however, comes to the aid of the appellees, 
because the carrier is thereunder excused from liability if the accident
 is due to a fortuitous event, and this was the ruling in the appealed 
decision.  This Court, in interpreting "fortuitous event", stated that 
"As will be seen, these authorities agree that some extraordinary 
circumstance independent of the will of the obligor, or of his 
employees, is an essential element of a <i>caso fortuito</i>." From the 
facts of the case at bar it is clear that the defendants' bus which 
carried Lambayong and Amsia capsized after being bumped on the left side
 by Habacco bus No. 39, which caused the defendants' driver to swerve 
his bus to the left so as to prevent it from falling into the canal and 
striking a tree, a maneuver which led the bus to skid and capsize.  
This, in our opinion, resulted from the extraordinary circumstance of 
being resulted from the extraordinary circumstance of being struck by 
the Habacco bus, independent of the will of, and unforseen by the 
defendants' driver, in the absence of any showing to the contrary.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the appealed decision is affirmed, and it is so 
ordered without costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Feria, Bengzon, Pablo, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, Bautista 
Angelo,</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
