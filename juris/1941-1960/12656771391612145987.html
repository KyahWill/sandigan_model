				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action for the recovery of the sum of P5,196.20 with legal 
interest thereon from the date of the filing of the complaint.
<p>On May 20, 1950, the ship "<em>Jupiter</em>", on her voyage No. 149, received 
on board at Carangian, Samar, in good order and condition, 107 bundles of first 
class loose weight hemp weighing 8,273 kilos, of 130.80 piculs, valued at 
P6,736.20, from Lee Teh &amp; Co., Inc., for transportation and delivery to 
Manila, under a bill of lading issued by the carrier to the shipper. The ship 
was owned by Adriano Choa" Joy, doing business under the name of South Sea 
Shipping Line, while the cargo was shipped by the branch office of Lee Teh &amp; 
Co., Inc. at Carangian, Samar, for transportation and delivery to its main 
office at Manila.</p>
<p>The cargo failed to arrive in Manila because the vessel ran aground while 
entering the Laoang Bay, Samar, on May 20, 1950, due to the negligence of its 
captain, Jose Molina, who, in the investigation conducted by the Marine Board of 
Inquiry, was found negligent of his duties and was suspended from office for a 
period of three months. Of the cargo, only 7,590 kilos, or 120 piculs of hemp, 
were saved and because of their damaged condition, they were sold for the sum of 
P2,040, the consignor having spent P500 for their salvage, thereby causing Lee 
Teh &amp; Co., Inc. losses in the sum of P5,196.20.</p>
<p>The cargo was insured by the New Zealand Insurance Co., Ltd., and because of 
the damage caused to said cargo while in transit, the losses were paid by said 
company to the shipper. The carrier having refused to reimburse these damages 
despite demands made to that effect, the insurance company, as subrogee of the 
shipper instituted the present action before the Court of First Instance of 
Manila.</p>
<p>After the parties had presented their evidence, the, court found that, while 
the shipper has suffered damages because of the inability of the carrier to 
transport the cargo as agreed upon, however, the liability of the carrier did 
not attach because of the failure of the shipper or of the consignee to file its 
claim for damages within 24 hours from receipt of the cargo as required by law. 
Consequently, the court dismissed the case, with costs against the plaintiff. 
Plaintiff brought this case on appeal directly to this Court.</p>
<p>Appellant poses in this appeal the following issue: "Whether Lee Teh &amp; 
Co., Inc. of Manila, as consignee, or Lee Teh &amp; Co., Inc., of Catarman, 
Samar, as consignor, should have filed its claim for damages to the cargo with 
the shipping company, herein defendant, within twenty four hours from the date 
the said cargo was salvaged by the consignor, in accordance with Article 366 of 
the Code of Commerce for this action to prosper, or that neither the said 
consignee nor the said consignor was under the obligation to file the said claim 
within the said period, as they are not bound by the provisions of Article 366 
of the Code of Commerce."</p>
<p>Article 366 of the Code of Commerce, which was applied by the court, 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Within twenty-four hours following the receipt of the merchandise, the claim 
against the carrier for damage or average which may be found therein upon 
opening the packages, may be made, provided that the indications of the damage 
or average which gives rise to the claim cannot be ascertained from the outside 
part of such packages, in which case the claim shall be admitted only at the 
time of receipt.</p>
<p>"After the periods mentioned have elapsed, or the transportation charges have 
been paid, no claim shall be admitted against the carrier with regard to the 
condition in which the goods transported were delivered."</p></blockquote>
<p>It would appear from the above that in order that the condition therein 
provided may be demanded there should be a consignment of goods, through a 
common carrier, by a consignor in one place to a consignee in another place. And 
said article provides that the claim for damages must be made "within 
twenty-four hours following the receipt of the merchandise" by the consignee 
from the carrier. In other words, there must be delivery of the merchandise by 
the carrier to the consignee at the place of destination. In the instant case, 
the consignor is the branch office of Lee Teh &amp; Co., Inc. at Catarman, 
Samar, which placed the cargo on board the ship Jupiter, and the consignee, its 
main office at Manila. The lower court found that the cargo never reached 
Manila, its destination, nor was1 it ever delivered to the consignee, the office 
of the shipper in Manila, because the ship ran aground upon entering Laoang Bay, 
Samar on the same day of the shipment. Such being the case, it follows that the 
aforesaid article 366 does not have application because the cargo was never 
received by the consignee. Moreover, under the bill of lading issued by the 
carrier (Exhibit C), it was the tetter's undertaking to bring the cargo to its 
destination—Manila,—and deliver it to consignee, which undertaking was never 
complied with. The carrier, therefore, breached its contract, and, as such, it 
forefeited its right to invoke in its favor the conditions required by article 
366.</p>
<p>One case parallel to the present is Roldan <em>vs</em>. Lim Ponzo &amp; Co., 
37 Phil, 285. In that case, plaintiff sought to recover damages for failure of 
defendant to transport 2,244 packages of sugar from plaintiff's 
<em>hacienda</em> to Iloilo. It was proven that the cargo did not reach its 
destination because the <em>lorcha</em> carrying it was wrecked in the river 
Jalaud through the negligence and lack of skill of the master of ithe 
<em>lorcha</em>. And of the total cargo of 2,244 packages of sugar, only 1,022 
were saved in damaged condition through the efforts made by the shipper. Because 
plaintiff failed to comply with the requirement of article 366 of the Code of 
Commerce, the lower court found for defendant and dismissed the case. But this 
Court held that said article "is limited to cases of claims for damages to goods 
actually received by the consignee; it has no application in cases wherein the 
goods entrusted to the carrier are not delivered to the consignee by the carrier 
in pursuance of the terms of the carriage contract." Elaborating on this point, 
this Court commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Article 366 of the Commercial Code is limited to cases of claims for damages 
to goods actually turned over by the carrier and received by the consignee, 
whether those damages be apparent from an examination of the packages in which 
the goods are delivered, or of such character that the nature and extent of the 
damage is not apparent until the packages are opened and the contents examined. 
Clearly it has no application in cases wherein the goods entrusted to the 
carrier are not delivered by the carrier to the consignee. In such cases there 
can be no question of &amp; claim for damages suffered by the goods while in 
transport, since the claim for damages arises exclusively out of the failure to 
make delivery." * * * </p>
<p>"We are of opinion, however, that the necessity for making the claim in 
accordance with that article did not arise if, as it is alleged, these 1,022 
packages, of sugar were recovered from the wreck by the plaintiff, himself^ in 
an effort, by his own activities, to save his property from total loss. The 
measures to be taken under the terms of Article 367 of the Code when the parties 
are unable to arrive at an amicable settlement of claims for damages set up in 
accordance with Article 866, quite clearly indicate that the necessity for the 
presentation of claims under this article arises only in those cases wherein the 
carrier makes delivery and the consignee receives the goods in pursuance of the 
terms of the contract."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that in the instant case there is some disagreement as to whether 
the salvage of the portion of the cargo that was saved was due to the efforts of 
the carrier itself or to the combined efforts of the latter and the shipper as a 
result of which the salvaged cargo was placed in possession of the shipper who 
sold it and deducted its proceeds from the liability of the carrier. But this 
discrepancy, in our opinion, would seem to be immaterial because the law as well 
as the contract contemplates delivery of the cargo to the consignee at its port 
of destination in order that the benefit of the law may be availed of. The 
liability of the carrier must be determined in the light of the carriage 
contract, and since that contract calls for reciprocal obligations, the carrier 
cannot demand fulfillment of its part from the shipper or consignee unless it 
first complies with its own obligation. (Article 1100, old Civil Code.) The fact 
that the consignor is but the branch office of the company that shipped the 
goods, and the consignee is the main office at Manila, is of no moment, because 
the duties of each party under the law are different. Moreover, even if the 
consignor and the consignee be considered as one and the same party, still the 
carrier cannot disclaim responsibility under its contract for the simple reason 
that it failed to comply with its obligation to bring the cargo to its 
destination. This breach alone justifies its liability under the carriage 
contract.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed, and another one 
will be entered ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of 
P5,196.20, with legal interest thereon from the filing of the complaint, with 
costs against appellee.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>REYES, A., J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>I dissent. While there is dispute as to whether the cargo of hemp was salvage 
through the efforts of the shipper or through those of the carrier, the lower 
court found that what was saved of the hemp was actually received by the 
shipper's agent at Catarman, who, however, did not file a claim for damages 
within 24 hours thereafter as provided in Article 366 of the Code of Commerce. 
The appellant contends that this article did not apply because "there was no 
delivery of goods by the carrier to the consignee." Upholding the contention, 
the majority opinion holds that the article has application only when the goods 
transported are delivered to the consignee at the port of destination but not 
otherwise, this on the theory that where the carrier breaches his contract by 
failing to take the goods to their destination he forfeits his right to invoke 
the article. To this I cannot agree.</p>
<p>The Article reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 366. Within the twenty-four hours following the receipt of the 
merchandise, the claim against the carrier for damages or average which may be 
found therein upon opening of the packages, may foe made, provided that the 
indications of the damage ox average which gives rise to the claim cannot be 
ascertained from the outside part of such packages in which case the claim shall 
be admitted only at the time of receipt.</p>
<p>"After the periods mentioned have elapsed, or the transportation charges have 
been paid, no claim shall be admitted against the carrier with regard to the 
condition in which the goods transported were delivered."</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowhere in this article is it said or even hinted that prompt claim with 
regard to the condition in which the goods transported were delivered is 
required only when the delivery is made to the consignee at destination. And on 
principle I do not see why the article should not apply also where delivery is 
made to the shipper or consignor whether at the port of destination or of 
embarkation or at any other place where the cargo is discharged. Especially 
would this be true in the present case where consignor and consignee are the 
same person or entity and where damage to the cargo was nob necessarily to be 
expected because the ship did not sink but merely ran aground, so that if any 
such damages was in fact noted upon delivery the same should have been promptly 
brought to the attention of the carrier.</p>
<p>The majority cites the case of Roldan <em>vs</em>. Lim Ponzo, 37 Phil, 255. 
That case should be authority against rather than in favor of their conclusion. 
For it is to be noted that in that case the claim was for 2,244 bay ones of 
sugar of which 1,222 bayones did not reach destination because the 
<em>lorcha</em> on which it was loaded was wrecked on the way, while the 
remaining 1,022 bayones were saved in a more or less damage condition, and this 
Court there held that as to the part of the sugar totally lost article 366 did 
not apply, but that as to the 1,022 bayones of sugar that were saved, although 
in a damaged condition, there was need for determining under what conditions the 
same came into the possession of the plaintiff, because while there was 
allegation that the said 1,022 bayones of sugar "were recovered from the wreck 
by the plaintiff himself, in an effort, by his own activities, to save his 
property from total loss", the defendant had not had an opportunity to submit 
his evidence to the court. This court, therefor, remanded the case to the court 
below for a new trial in order to determine whether it was the carrier or the 
sipper that salvaged th6 sugar. The reason for this is to be found in the 
following excerpts from the decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In so far as this action is founded on a claim for damages resulting from 
the wetting of the 1,022 packages of sugar which were saved from the wreck, it 
seems clear that if these 1,022 packages of sugar were delivered by the carrier 
and received by the consignee under and in pursuance of the terms of the 
contract, this claim for damages could be defeated by the plaintiff's failure to 
make claim therefor in accordance with the term of article 866 of the Code.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"Until the defendant has had an opportunity to submit his evidence it is 
impossible to determine under what conditions these 1,022 packages of sugar came 
into the possession of the plaintiff, or to determine whether his claims for 
damages by the wetting of this sugar, if well founded in every other respect, is 
or should be defeated by his failure to make claim for such damages in the 
manner and from indicated in Article 366 of the Commercial 
Code."</p></blockquote>
<p>If we really mean to follow the decision of this Court in that former case, I 
think the proper thing to do is to first determine whether the hemp in this case 
was salvaged by the carrier or by the shipper. But as that is a disputed 
question of fact, the case should be certified to the Court of Appeals since it 
does not involve a purely legal question.</p></div>
