				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The plaintiff Fernando Manuel was the registered owner of a piece of land acquired by him as&nbsp; a homestead.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1937, he&nbsp; mortgaged the&nbsp; land to the Philippine&nbsp; National Bank as security for&nbsp; a loan.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the&nbsp; loan&nbsp; was not paid, the mortgage was foreclosed&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with Act No. 3135 and the&nbsp; land&nbsp; sold&nbsp; at public auction&nbsp; on September 8, 1941, the&nbsp; provincial sheriff giving the buyer, the Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of sale,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was recorded&nbsp; in the&nbsp; register&nbsp; of&nbsp; deeds&nbsp; on the 13th of that same month.<br><br>Plaintiff had,&nbsp; under said Act No.&nbsp; 3135,&nbsp; the&nbsp; right&nbsp; to redeem his land&nbsp; within&nbsp; one year&nbsp; "from&nbsp; and&nbsp; after the date of the sale" in accordance with&nbsp; the procedure prescribed by the Rules of Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he&nbsp; failed to&nbsp; exercise that&nbsp; right&nbsp; within the period&nbsp; given,&nbsp; which expired&nbsp; on September 9, 1942, and&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court, the purchaser&nbsp; at public auction&nbsp; was, from this latter date, entitled to a final deed from the sheriff.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; for reasons which do not appear, it was not until September 2, 1950, or&nbsp; some 9 years after&nbsp; the&nbsp; auction sale,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; final&nbsp; deed&nbsp; was&nbsp; given&nbsp; by&nbsp; the sheriff&nbsp; and&nbsp; recorded in the register of deeds and the corresponding certificate of title issued to the bank.<br><br>The land was subsequently&nbsp; sold by the bank to Roberto Avena and by the&nbsp; latter, in turn, to Lucia&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Babaran who,&nbsp; upon the sales being recorded, was, on September 4, 1950, issued the corresponding transfer certificate&nbsp; of title.<br><br>In&nbsp; October,&nbsp; 1954, plaintiff, invoking&nbsp; the homesteader's right of&nbsp; redemption&nbsp; under&nbsp; section&nbsp; 119&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public Land Law,&nbsp; offered to&nbsp; repurchase&nbsp; the land, and upon the offer being rejected,&nbsp; deposited the redemption&nbsp; money in court and brought the present action against the Philippine National Bank and the subsequent buyers to&nbsp; compel them or any of them to reconvey the land to him.<br><br>The defendants set up the defense that plaintiff's right to redeem&nbsp; the&nbsp; land had already expired.&nbsp; And the lower court having upheld that defense and dismissed the complaint for that reason, plaintiff appealed the case directly to this&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; the questions raised being purely legal.<br><br>The case&nbsp; hinges on&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the 5-year&nbsp; redemption period fixed in&nbsp; section 119 of the Public Land Law should, in the case of&nbsp; a homestead sold as a result of an&nbsp; extra- judicial foreclosure,&nbsp; be&nbsp; counted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of the sale&nbsp; or&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date of the sheriff's final deed of sale.<br><br>The said section provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 119.—Every conveyance of land acquired under the&nbsp; Free Patent or Homestead provisions, when' proper, shall&nbsp; be subject to repurchase&nbsp; by the&nbsp; applicant, his&nbsp; widow or legal heirs within&nbsp; a period of 5 years from the date of the conveyance."</blockquote>In&nbsp; Galanza&nbsp; vs. Nuesa (50&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz. 4213), where&nbsp; a homestead was sold with <i>pacto de retro</i>,&nbsp; we ruled that the buyer's title became absolute&nbsp; when the&nbsp; seller failed to repurchase&nbsp; the&nbsp; homestead within five years&nbsp; from the date of the sale.&nbsp; Applying that ruling in a&nbsp; recent case (Leoncio Monge,&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Lino Angeles,&nbsp; et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>&nbsp; G. R. No. L-9558, May&nbsp; 24, 1957), where a homestead was&nbsp; sold subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; redemption within one&nbsp; year, we held that the 5-year redemption period prescribed in&nbsp; the above section should be&nbsp; counted from the date of the&nbsp; sale and not from the date the ownership&nbsp; of&nbsp; the land "had become consolidated"&nbsp; in the buyers. <br><br>Appellant,&nbsp; however, cites&nbsp; an earlier&nbsp; decision, that of Paras vs. Court of Appeals,&nbsp; et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>&nbsp; (G. E.&nbsp; No. L-4091, May 28, 1962)&nbsp; and&nbsp; on the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; thereof contends that the final deed issued by the&nbsp; sheriff in the present case on September 2, 1950 should be taken as the conveyance referred to&nbsp; in section 119&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public Land Law, so&nbsp; that the 5-year redemption&nbsp; period provided for in that section&nbsp; should be&nbsp; counted from that&nbsp; date&nbsp; and not&nbsp; from&nbsp; the date of the&nbsp; execution sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; The citation does not necessarily help appellant's&nbsp; position.&nbsp; For while we&nbsp; there expressed&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; to&nbsp; the opinion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals that the 5-year&nbsp; redemption period provided for in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Public Land Law does not begin from the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of the sale—when&nbsp; a mere provisional certificate of sale&nbsp; is issued by&nbsp; the sheriff,—we at&nbsp; the same&nbsp; time accepted&nbsp; that court's&nbsp; view&nbsp; that the&nbsp; said&nbsp; 5-year period begins&nbsp; "on the day after the&nbsp; expiration of the period of repurchase" provided&nbsp; for in foreclosure sales.&nbsp; And there is no question that appellant&nbsp; in the present case did&nbsp; not attempt to repurchase his homestead&nbsp; until after 12 years after the expiration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; one-year period&nbsp; of&nbsp; repurchase allowed in an extrajudicial foreclosure.&nbsp; Note must be taken of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that under the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court the expiration of that one-year&nbsp; period&nbsp; forecloses the owner's right to redeem, thus making the&nbsp; sheriff's sale absolute. The issuance&nbsp; thereafter of a final deed of sale&nbsp; becomes a mere formality, an act merely confirmatory of the title that is already in the purchaser and constituting official evidence of&nbsp; that&nbsp; fact.<br><br>Section 50 of the Land Registration Law does not militate against this view.&nbsp; That section provides&nbsp; in&nbsp; effect that&nbsp; a&nbsp; deed in itself&nbsp; does&nbsp; not effect a conveyance and that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is the act of&nbsp; registration&nbsp; that&nbsp; effects&nbsp; such conveyance.&nbsp; As&nbsp; repeatedly declared&nbsp; by&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; "the registration is intended to protect the&nbsp; buyer against claims of third persons arising from subsequent alienations by the vendor, and is certainly not necessary&nbsp; to give&nbsp; effect as&nbsp; between&nbsp; the parties to their deed of sale."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Galanza vs. Nuesa, <i>supra</i>, Galasinao et al., vs. Austria, et al., 97 Phil., 82, 51 Off. Gaz. 2874 and cases&nbsp; therein&nbsp; cited.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, as between the parties themselves, the conveyance is effective from the date&nbsp; of the sale and&nbsp; not from the date of the registration of the deed. <br><br>It follows&nbsp; from the foregoing that&nbsp; appellant's attempt to exercise his&nbsp; right of redemption under the Public Land Law some 13 years from the auction sale or 12&nbsp; years from the expiration of his right of&nbsp; redemption under the Rules of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; was&nbsp; too late,&nbsp; so that the lower court did&nbsp; not err in dismissing his complaint. <br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. <br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp;&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Endencia</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Felix, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Supra, P. 663.<br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">•</sup> 91 Phil., 389</div>
