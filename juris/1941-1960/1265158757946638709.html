				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-1891, March 31, 1949</h4>
				<H3>CO CHIONG, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. THE MAYOR OF MANILA, THE CITY TREASURER OF MANILA, THE MEMBERS OF THE MARKET COMMITTEE OF THE CITY OF MANILA, THE MARKET MASTERS OF DIVISORIA, ARRANQUE, QUINTA, OBRERO, BAMBANG, SAMPALOC, PACO AND OTHER MARKETS OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Petitioners allege that they are lessees of public market 
stalls in the City of Manila by virtue of contracts of lease expressly 
understood to be of continuous duration until the City Mayor, for any reasonable 
or just cause or any violation of the provisions of the market code or any 
ordinance, or any rules relating to the administration of public markets, 
revokes the same; that on October 1, 1946, Republic Act No. 37 was promulgated 
and, to carry into effect its purposes, the Secretary of Finance issued 
Department Order No. 32 on November 29, 1946; that petitioners filed with the 
Court of First Instance of Manila a petition challenging the constitutionality 
of Republic Act No. 37 and of Department of Finance Order No. 32 and praying for 
injunction to restrain their ejection from the leased public market stalls; that 
on April 19, 1947, the trial court rendered judgment annulling Section 2 of 
Department of Finance Order No. 32 and commanding respondents to desist from 
enforcing the provisions thereof, from which decision respondents appealed to 
the Supreme Court; that on June 26, 1947, Ordinance No. 3051, amending Ordinance 
No. 2995, was promulgated, providing for the termination of the occupancy of 
public market stalls by the Chinese petitioners; that petitioners are entitled 
to a writ of injunction to command respondents to desist from enforcing said 
Ordinance No. 3051 because it was returned by the mayor with a qualified 
approval which, therefore, operated as a veto and avoided the promulgation of a 
valid ordinance, as the mayor has no right to qualify his approval and thereby 
amend the ordinances adopted by the municipal board; that while Ordinance No. 
3051 provided for the termination on June 30, 1947 of any existing permission 
granted for the occupancy of public market stalls, the mayor approved the same 
subject to his interpretation that licenses paid, up to December 31, 1947 would 
not terminate until the latter date; that Ordinance No. 3051 is null and void, 
being inconsistent with the public policy of the state as declared in Republic 
Act No. 37; that said ordinance is unconstitutional in that it impairs the 
obligation of contracts, it nullifies the substantial protection of due process, 
it denies petitioners and aliens the equal protection of the law, is 
unreasonable, unfair, oppressive, partial, and discriminatory, and is in 
conflict with common right, it prohibits trade by Chinese stallholders, is 
violative of the generally accepted principles of international law and of the 
treaty obligations of the Philippines with respect to commercial activities by 
Chinese and other aliens, and of the basic principles laid down in the United 
Nations Organization Charter; that said ordinance cannot be enforced while the 
question of the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 37 is pending before the 
courts; and that the ordinance is obviously an attempt by an inferior 
legislative body to evade the decision rendered by the trial court in civil case 
No. 1436.
<p align="justify">Petitioners pray for the issuance of a writ of preliminary 
injunction which was denied on January 8, 1948.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners filed an urgent petition for preliminary injunction 
and motion for reconsideration of said resolution of January 8, but they were 
also denied by resolution issued on January 21, 1948.</p>
<p align="justify">Respondents deny petitioners' allegation with respect to the 
conditions of the contracts of lease, conceding <i>arguendo</i> that petitioners 
were lessees for the occupancy of the public market stalls in question, and 
allege that the fees of stallholders were collected either daily, weekly or 
monthly and, therefore, the contracts of lease which had no definite period had 
expired on December 31, 1947; that petitioners' claim, that said leases are of 
continuous and indefinite duration, is contrary to law and would nullify the 
purpose of Republic Act No. 37, as well as Ordinance No. 3051 independently 
intended to put into effect the provisions of said act; that Ordinance No. 3051 
does not impair the obligation of contracts because the licenses granted to 
petitioners to occupy public market stalls were not contracts but lease 
privileges which may be withdrawn at will; that the establishment, maintenance 
and operation of markets, admittedly governmental in nature, are non-separable 
from the regulation as regards the leasing thereof, and the occupants have which 
no such interest in the stall which a lessee of a store or dwelling has, and 
that the municipal corporation may provide for the revocation of the permit or 
licenses; that petitioners are mere licensees and their licenses are not 
contracts which would create in their favor vested rights protected against 
future and subsequent enactments; that Ordinance No. 3051 does not deprive 
petitioners of the equal protection of law, which does not limit the police 
power of the state to legislate for the promotion of the general welfare and 
prosperity, and the nationalization of retail trade; that the ordinance is not 
unreasonable, unfair, oppressive, partial and discriminatory and it is not made 
the subject of civil case No. 1436 of the Court of First Instance of Manila and, 
by its nature, may be enforced independently of Republic Act No. 37; and that no 
generally accepted principle in international law is violated by its enactment, 
while, on the other hand, the right of a state to self-determination is 
respected by the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no question that the establishment, maintenance and 
operation of public markets are governmental in nature, being among the public 
functions of the state and, therefore, the opportunity of occupying stalls in 
public markets is a privilege that can be granted or withdrawn without impairing 
any one of the guarantees embodied in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution. In 
the case of Co Chiong, et al. vs. Miguel Cuaderno, Sr., et al., L-1440, we have 
already declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Public markets are public services or utilities as much as the 
public supply and sale of gas, gasoline, electricity, water and public 
transportation are. Under the Constitution, the operation of all public services 
are reserved to Filipino citizens and to corporations or associations sixty 
<i>per centum</i> of the capital of which belongs to Filipino citizens.</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">" 'No franchise, certificate, or any other form of 
authorization for the operation of a public utility shall be granted except to 
citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or other entities organized under 
the laws of the Philippines, sixty <i>per centum</i> of the capital of which is 
owned by citizens of the Philippines, nor shall such franchise, certificate, or 
authorization be exclusive in character or for a longer period than fifty years. 
No franchise or right shall be granted to any individual, firm, or corporation, 
except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or 
repeal by the Congress when the public interest so requires.'</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Foodstuffs sold in public markets demand, at least, as much 
official control and supervision as the commodities sold and distributed in 
other public utilities. They affect the life and health of the people, the 
safeguarding of which is one of the basic obligations of a constituted 
government. Official control and supervision can be exercised more effectively 
if public market stalls are occupied by citizens rather than by aliens.</p>
<p align="justify">"In impugning the validity of Republic Act No. 37, appellees 
invoke general guarantees in the Bill of Rights, such as the due process of law 
and the equal protection of the laws. Even if their position could be supported 
under said general guarantees, a hypothesis the validity of which we consider 
unnecessary to decide, said guarantees have to give way to the specific 
provision above quoted, which reserves to Filipino citizens the operation of 
public services or utilities.</p>
<p align="justify">"Furthermore, the establishment, maintenance, and operation of 
public markets, as much as public works, are part of the functions of 
government. The privilege of participating in said functions, such as that of 
occupying public market stalls, is not among the fundamental rights or even 
among the general civil rights protected by the guarantees of the Bill of 
Rights. The exercise or enjoyment of public functions are reserved to a class of 
persons possessing the specific qualifications required by law. Such is the case 
of the privilege to vote, to occupy a government position, or to participate in 
public works. They are reserved exclusively to citizens. Public functions are 
powers of national sovereignty and it is elementary that such sovereignty be 
exercised exclusively by nationals.</p>
<p align="justify">"Although foreigners are entitled to all the rights and 
privileges of friendly guests, they can not claim the right to enjoy privileges 
which by their nature belong exclusively to the hosts."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">With the above pronouncements the whole controversy is disposed 
of against petitioners. Ordinance No. 3051 offends neither, the constitutional 
clause guranteeing the obligation of contracts nor the guarantees of due process 
of law and equal protection of the law. Neither does it violate any principle of 
international law nor any of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations 
Organization. It does not impair any treaty commitment, as the treaties 
mentioned by petitioners have no binding effect upon the Republic of the 
Philippines, which is not a party to said treaties. The Philippines is bound 
only by treaties concluded and ratified in accordance with our Constitution. 
Ordinance No. 3051 of the City of Manila is valid.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and <i>Tuason, 
JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Paras,</i> and <i>Feria, JJ.</i>, concur in the 
result.</p></div>
