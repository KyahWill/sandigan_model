				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On&nbsp; March 3, 1949,&nbsp; the National&nbsp; Airports&nbsp; Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the lessor) and Leopoldo Prieto entered&nbsp; into a concession contract&nbsp; (Exhibit A), whereby the latter&nbsp; was granted the&nbsp; exclusive rights to establish, operate,&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; and&nbsp; maintain&nbsp; a Snack Bar&nbsp; within&nbsp; the International Airport, in the municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; Parañaque, province of Rizal, for a period of two&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; years from March IS,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; in&nbsp; consideration of a monthly rental of P300,&nbsp; plus a royalty of three per centum (3%) of the gross sales&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; telephone, electrical&nbsp; and water charges. Alleging that Prieto wag delinquent in the payment of said rentals,&nbsp; royalties&nbsp; and&nbsp; charges,&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 27, 1949,&nbsp; the lessor instituted this action for&nbsp; the recovery of P2,777.61, with interest and costs.&nbsp; In his answer to&nbsp; the complaint, Prieto alleged a breach of contract on the part of the lessor, upon the ground that it had allowed the establishment, in a building of the Philippine Air Lines,&nbsp; Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the PAL)—to which the International Airport was leased, for the operation of its airline business—of a store engaged in the same business which was the exclusive right of Prieto to do, under his aforementioned concession, and that he, accordingly, had suffered damages, which he prayed, by way of counterclaim, that the lessor be sentenced to indemnify.&nbsp; Thereafter, the lessor filed against the PAL a third-party complaint, stating that said store in the PAL premises had been opened and maintained by the PAL without&nbsp; the knowledge and consent of the lessor and in violation of the rules and regulations, governing commercial activity within&nbsp; the area of said. airport, which&nbsp; are binding to the&nbsp; PAL, and that, consequently,&nbsp; Prieto had sued the lessor&nbsp; for damages resulting from breach of his concession, and&nbsp; praying that the PAL be sentenced to pay to the lessor such amount as the latter may be required to indemnify Prieto, should he obtain a favorable judgment on his counterclaim.&nbsp; Answering the third-party complaint, the PAL asserted that it had authority to permit, and did permit, the operation of the store in question within its premises in the International Airport; that the lessor had consented thereto; and&nbsp; that, at any&nbsp; rate, said store had been opened&nbsp; and run by the PAL Cooperative Association, a corporation distinct and different from the PAL, which is not responsible for the acts&nbsp; of said association.&nbsp; In due course, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision the dispositive part of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"En vista de todo lo expuesto, el Juzgado dicta sentoncia:<br><br>"(<i>a</i>) gobreseyendo Ja&nbsp; demanda contra el demandado;<br>"(<i>b</i>) condenando a Ja demandante National Airports Corporation<br>a pagar al demandado Leopoldo Prieto la cantidad de P7,823.16, en concepto de danos y perjuicios, y&nbsp; las costas; y<br>"(<i>c</i>) condenando a la tercera parte demaadada Philippine Airlines, Inc. a pagar&nbsp; a la&nbsp; demandante&nbsp; National Airports Corporation la referida. eantidad&nbsp; de P7,823.16, eon las costas."<br></blockquote>On appeal taken by the PAL, this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The PAL&nbsp; now seeks a review, by certiorari, of the decision of the latter court.<br><br>It is not disputed that the&nbsp; lessor is guilty of breach of its contract with Prieto; that Prieto had, by reason of the operation of the cooperative store, sustained damages which, after deducting&nbsp; the balance of the rentals and the telephone, electric and water charges due from him, amount to the sum stated in the decisions of the court of first instance&nbsp; and the Court of Appeals;&nbsp; and that the lessor should indemnify said amount.&nbsp; The&nbsp; only issue for determination&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal is whether the lessor is entitled to, reimbursement from the PAL.. The latter maintains the negative, upon two&nbsp; (2) grounds, namely:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; that the. lessor had consented to the establishment&nbsp; and operation of said&nbsp; cooperative store; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that&nbsp; the same&nbsp; was organized&nbsp; and maintained&nbsp; by, and&nbsp; belongs to, the&nbsp; PAL Cooperative&nbsp; Association,&nbsp; not&nbsp; the PAL, which&nbsp; is separate and independent from said association.&nbsp; We find no merit in this pretense.<br><br>To begin with, the Court of Appeals said in its decision:<br><blockquote>"The allogations that the store of the&nbsp; PAL Cooperative was opened only after proper authority&nbsp; therefor&nbsp; had been&nbsp; obtained is untenable.&nbsp; On this point Zosa testified:<br><br>'A. I went to see Col. Villamor, who was then the general manager of the National Airports Corporation, and talked to him and told him&nbsp; about&nbsp; the intention of&nbsp; these boys in&nbsp; having&nbsp; or&nbsp; forming&nbsp; a cooperative&nbsp; association, and he said it was a very good idea and to go ahead with it, and that they arc supposed to follow the paper work, and I wrote him a letter&nbsp; also about requesting permission to construct in our compound a building for' the use of these boys, which was promised by the management and that they were going to avail themselves of the space for their use.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (t. s.&nbsp; n. p. 137) The letter which he sent to the&nbsp; National Airports for the purpose was never answered."<br></blockquote>In other words, said appellate court held that the lessor's alleged consent to the creation and operation of the&nbsp; cooperative store had not been proved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from being conclusive upon us, this finding appears to be fully supported by the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it is admitted that, as early, as&nbsp; February 28, 1949, the lessor had written to the PAL a letter stating that&nbsp; the&nbsp; cooperative store should be closed because it violated existing rules and regulations. Instead of being surprised at&nbsp; the attitude of the lessor as the PAL would have logically reacted, had it secured the lessor's consent to the opening of the cooperative store and of reminding the lessor&nbsp; of its aforementioned consent, had it really been given, and of the&nbsp; inconsistency thereof with its&nbsp; aforesaid attitude, the PAL mildly replied with the statement that said store was catering solely to PAL personnel.&nbsp; Again, on May 10,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; Prieto wrote to the&nbsp; lessor protesting against the operation of said&nbsp; cooperative store as a violation&nbsp; of his&nbsp; concession 'contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; On May&nbsp; 23, 1949, the lessor answered with the following letter:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "May 23, 1049<br></div><br>Atty.
