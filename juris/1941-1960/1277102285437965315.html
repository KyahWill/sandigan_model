				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 6,1925, one Justo Laguna, absolute owner in his lifetime of two parcels  of land described in appellant's petition for certiorari, died intestate and was survived by two children, Bonifacio and Vivencia, his third son Pantaleon having died before him leaving a daughter named Andrea who also died before him leaving a son named Esteban Laguna Fabie.  Bonifacio, in turn, died intestate on May 28, 1929, without descendant and  was survived only by his wife, Ambrosia Levantino.  A month after the death of Bonifacio, his surviving spouse,  Ambrosia Levantino, and the heirs of the deceased Justo—Vivencia and Esteban Laguna Fabie—agreed to divide extrajudicially the respective properties of the two deceased, and to this effect executed  two deeds of  partition,  the  first,  Exhibit A,  by Vivencia  and Esteban Laguna Fabie, purporting to  divide the  properties left by the deceased Justo; and, the second, Exhibit B, by Ambrosia Levantino and Vivencia Laguna, purporting to  divide the properties left by the deceased Bonifacio.  The two parcels of land aforecited  and  which v constitute the  sole subject of the present  litigation, were erroneously included in the second deed of  partition, Vivencia  Laguna then of the belief that said parcels were conjugal property of the deceased Bonifacio and his spouse. Six  years thereafter,  Vivencia Laguna, discovering  the error, instituted an action in  the Court of First  Instance of Pangasinan for the recovery of the portion erroneously assigned to Ambrosia Levantino.   Judgment was rendered declaring, inter alia, the partition null and void and adjudging the two parcels of land to be the exclusive properties of the petitioner Vivencia Laguna.  Respondent Ambrosia Levantino appealed to the Court of Appeals which reversed the  judgment of the trial court, holding that the deceased Bonifacio Laguna, who had declared the two parcels of land in question for tax  purposes since 1914,  had acquired a perfect title thereto by prescription; that petitioner's action for the rescission of the partition has prescribed; and that petitioner is in estoppel she having signed the deed of partition.<br><br>From the undisputed facts of the case,  Bonifacio Laguna's possession of the two parcels in question during the lifetime of his father Justo, appears no more than in the character of trustee.  And  it is a well-settled rule that possession of a trustee is, in law, possession of the  <i>cestui que trust</i> and, therefore, it  cannot be a good  ground for title by prescription.  The  only instance  In  which the possession of a trustee may be deemed adverse to the  <i>cestui que trust</i> is when the former makes an open  repudiation of the trust by unequivocal acts made known to the latter.  It has been held that the trustee may claim title by prescription founded on adverse possession, where it appears (a) that he has performed unequivocal acts of repudiation amounting to an ouster of the <span style="font-style: italic;">cestui que trust;</span>  (6) that such positive acts of repudiation  have been made known to the <span style="font-style: italic;">cestui que trust;</span>  and (c) that the evidence  thereon should be clear and conclusive.  Acts which may be adverse to strangers may not be  sufficiently adverse to the  <i>cestui que trust</i>.  A mere  silent possession of the trustee  unaccompanied with acts amounting  to an ouster of the <span style="font-style: italic;"> cestui que trust</span> cannot be  construed  as an  adverse  possession. Mere perception of  rents  and profits by the trustee, and erecting fences and building adapted for the cultivation of the land held in trust, are  not  equivalent to unequivocal acts of ouster of the <i>cestui que trust</i>.  (Cortes et al. v.  Oliva, 83 Phil., 480; Bargayo v. Camumot, 40  Phil., 857; Espeidel v. Henrice,  120 U, S.  377).   In  the instant case, the sole fact of Bonifacio's having declared the lands in his  name for tax purposes, constitutes no such unequivocal act of repudiation amounting to an ouster of his father,  Justo Laguna, and cannot thus constitute adverse possession as bask for title by prescription.<br><br>From what has been said,  it follows that the two parcels of land in question were of the exclusive ownership of Justo Laguna in his lifetime, and upon his death, should pass to his heirs, Vivencia Laguna, Esteban Laguna Pabie and the heirs,  of Bonifacio Laguna.   The partition  subsequently made upon the erroneous assumption that the two parcels of land were of  the conjugal partnership of the deceased Bonifacio Laguna  and his wife Ambrosia Levantino, and assigning to  her a property to which she had  absolutely no right,  is  a  contract  without consideration  and is void. (Art. 1081 Civil Code; De Torres v, De Torres, 28 Phil., 49).  The Court of Appeals, held,  however, that, as six years had already  elapsed from the  date of the execution of the deed of partition, the action  instituted by the petitioner for the rescission of the partition on the  ground of lesion had prescribed,  under article 1076 of the Civil Code. But, as correctly ruled by the trial court, the  action is not really one of rescission, which presupposes a valid partition, but, one of revindication, ignoring a void partition, and as such, prescribes in ten years.   Such partition  as respect Ambrosia Levantino who has no right  to inherit from Justo  Laguna is legally  non-existing  (7 Manresa, 726) and may be completely ignored.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also  ruled that the petitioner,  in having  signed the  deed of partition, is now estopped  in impugning its validity.  Suffice it to say that, as a general rule, acquiescence  through innocent mistake cannot constitute a basis for estoppel.  (21 C. J., 1125).<br><br>The judgment  of the Court of Appeals  is reversed and that of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, affirmed, with costs against  respondents.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Diaz</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ</span>., concur.  <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Imperial</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Laurel, JJ.,</span>concur  in the result.</div>
