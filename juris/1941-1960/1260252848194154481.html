				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order of dismissal issued by the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Hon. Nicasio Yatco presiding, and a subsequent order denying the motion for&nbsp; its (the first order) reconsideration.<br><br>Complaint in this case was&nbsp; filed on&nbsp; May 16, 1956 and the answer on June 1, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 11, 1956,&nbsp; plaintiff moved the court to set the case for hearing and on the following day, June 12, 1956, the case was set for hearing on July 5, 1956.&nbsp; On June 25, defendant filed a motion for leave to&nbsp; file a&nbsp; third-party complaint,&nbsp; which&nbsp; third-party complaint accompanied the motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; No objection was registered&nbsp; against&nbsp; this petition,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; court on June 30, 1956 granted the&nbsp; petition and admitted&nbsp; the third-party complaint.<br><br>When on July 5, 1956, the case was called for hearing as&nbsp; previously ordered&nbsp; by the&nbsp; court, none of the parties appeared; whereupon,&nbsp; the court dismissed it, without costs.<br><br>The following day plaintiff filed a motion for&nbsp; the reconsideration of the order on the ground that his failure to appear was caused by his belief that inasmuch as the third- party complaint had been admitted on June 30,&nbsp; and the summons to the third-party defendant had not yet been issued,&nbsp; the hearing could not&nbsp; be held.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court&nbsp; denied this motion; hence, this appeal.<br><br>Even if the summons to the third-party defendant has actually been issued, it does not appear that he has already filed&nbsp; his answer as he&nbsp; has fifteen days to do so from the time of the receipts&nbsp; of&nbsp; summons.<br><br>It is apparent that in view of the admission of the third-party complaint on June 30, 1956 and the fact&nbsp; that the defendant thereto must be summoned&nbsp; and&nbsp; be&nbsp; allowed to answer, the case was&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; ready for trial at the time previously set for hearing, i. e., July 5,&nbsp; 1956.&nbsp; If the court was not aware of the existence&nbsp; of the third-party complaint on July 5, 1956, its attention was called to it by the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The order of dismissal was therefore ill-advised and it is hereby set aside, and the case returned to the court<span style="font-style: italic;"> a quo </span>for further proceedings.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Concepcion, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
