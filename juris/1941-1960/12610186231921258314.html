				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On April 25, 1932, spouses Lorenzo Claridad and Isabel Togle executed a deed of sale with right to repurchase of a parcel&nbsp; of land situated in Bago, Negros&nbsp; Occidental, in favor of&nbsp; Paterno Aposagas on&nbsp; condition that the vendors may repurchase the same within a period of&nbsp; 10 years from said date.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was also agreed that during the period of 10 years the vendee may enjoy the land as usufructuary.<br><br>On March 10, 1936, Aposagas transferred all his rights and interests in the sale to Isabel&nbsp; Novella subject to the same&nbsp; conditions stipulated in the&nbsp; contract&nbsp; executed on April&nbsp; 25, 1932.&nbsp; On May 20, 1942,&nbsp; twenty-four days&nbsp; after the expiration of the 10-year period agreed upon for redemption, Isabel Novella consolidated her&nbsp; ownership over the land for failure of the vendors to exercise their&nbsp; right of redemption.&nbsp; On March 27, 1944, the vendors a&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">retro </span>deposited the&nbsp; sum of P800.00 in Japanese notes with the clerk of court&nbsp; of Negros Occidental&nbsp; by way of consignation in an attempt to redeem the land from the vendee&nbsp; Isabel Novella.<br><br>In the meantime, spouses&nbsp; Lorenzo&nbsp; Claridad&nbsp; and&nbsp; Isabel Togle,&nbsp; original vendors a&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">retro</span>, died and because of the refusal of&nbsp; Isabel Novella to allow the redemption of the property&nbsp; notwithstanding the tender of payment they had made, the heirs of said spouses filed on March 13, 1944 an action before&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Negros Occidental against Isabel Novella praying that&nbsp; the latter be ordered to reconvey the&nbsp; land to&nbsp; them after acceptance of the deposit of P800.00 they had made and that she be ordered to&nbsp; pay damages and costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 5,&nbsp; 1944, after due trial, the court, Judge Francisco Arellano presiding, rendered a decision dismissing the&nbsp; complaint and ordering that the&nbsp; deposit of P800.00 made by the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; be returned to them, with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In due time, plaintiffs&nbsp; took the case&nbsp; on appeal&nbsp; to the Court of Appeals, but no action thereon was taken&nbsp; until the records of the case were destroyed as a result of the battle for liberation.<br><br>Plaintiffs, instead of reconstituting the records that were destroyed,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1950 a&nbsp; new&nbsp; case&nbsp; before the same court covering the same subject matter as in the original case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was&nbsp; barred by a&nbsp; prior judgment, referring to&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision rendered by&nbsp; Judge Francisco Arellano.&nbsp; This motion was sustained by Judge Jose Teodoro, Sr. in&nbsp; an order entered&nbsp; on August 11, 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiffs appealed this order to the Supreme Court (G. R. No. L-4207), and on&nbsp; October 24, 1952, the latter rendered decision reversing the order of Judge Teodoro, Sr. and ordering that the case be remanded to the court below for further&nbsp; proceedings.<br><br>While the case was pending trial on the merits as ordered by the Supreme Court, it&nbsp; was discovered that&nbsp; the records of the&nbsp; original case which involved&nbsp; the&nbsp; same parties and subject matter were not destroyed and so, in line with the ruling of this Court in the case of Nacua <i>vs.</i> Alo, 93 Phil., 595;&nbsp; 49 Off. Gaz., 3353, both&nbsp; parties filed a joint&nbsp; motion praying for&nbsp; the dismissal&nbsp; of the case&nbsp; and for&nbsp; the&nbsp; revival of the original Case No. 54, giving to plaintiffs-appellants a period of 30 days within which to present a&nbsp; new record on appeal, notice of appeal and appeal bond for&nbsp; elevation to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; This was done and so the original case&nbsp; then pending&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of Appeals was deemed duly reconstituted and submitted for decision with the only&nbsp; hitch that, upon examination of the records&nbsp; as reconstituted, it was found that&nbsp; while&nbsp; the stenographic notes taken during the the trial were intact, they have not however been transcribed.&nbsp; And on&nbsp; May 23, 1957,&nbsp; considering that the only issue&nbsp; involved in the appeal&nbsp; is one of law, the Court of Appeals certified the case to us for adjudication under the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended.<br><br>Appellants&nbsp; contend&nbsp; that the trial court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in not entertaining&nbsp; their claim that&nbsp; they had offered to repurchase the land from appellee sometime in March, 1942 or before the expiration&nbsp; of the 10-year&nbsp; period of&nbsp; redemption which the latter unreasonably&nbsp; refused to accept for which reason&nbsp; they deposited the sum of P800.00 with the clerk of court by way of consignation as required by law.&nbsp; The trial court, after analyzing the evidence submitted by both parties, made on this&nbsp; point the following findings:<br><blockquote>"Cuando se considera que Juan Claridad en Marzo 27, 1944, casi dos anos despues de expirar el plazo para&nbsp; el retracto,&nbsp; al ofrecer la recompra&nbsp; del&nbsp; lote&nbsp; en&nbsp; cuestion,&nbsp; hubo&nbsp; de hacerse acompanar por Antonio Canellada que le corroboro, para presenciar&nbsp; y atestiguar este el acto, en cambio, ni en Marzo de 1942 ni en igual mes de 1943, en que pretende haber hecho igrual oferta, no solo dejo de tomar igual o similar&nbsp; precaucion, sino que no&nbsp; tpmo&nbsp; absolutamente ninguna, a falta&nbsp; de satisfactoria explicacion, el Juzgado&nbsp; abriga&nbsp; serias&nbsp; dudas sobre&nbsp; la veracidad de si pretension y declaracion. Y si&nbsp; a este se anade que no hizo consignacion de&nbsp; pago,&nbsp; cuando, como pretende, le fue rechazada la oferta en 1942 o en 1943, cosa que lo hizo en 1944 con extra-ordinaria prontitud, estando como esjaba el Juzgado funcionando normalmente en Marzo y Abril hasta el&nbsp; 20 de Mayo de 1942 y en&nbsp; todo el ano&nbsp; 1943,&nbsp; el Juzgado llega a la conclusi6n de que&nbsp; los demandantes no&nbsp; hicieron tal oferta&nbsp; de&nbsp; recompra en 1942, y&nbsp; al&nbsp; no hacerlo, la venta a retro a favor de la demandada queda convertida despues del 25 de Abril de 1942, en una venta absolute y definitiva. La&nbsp; conducta de Juan Claridad durante su testimonio&nbsp; ha&nbsp; sido altamente suspechoso para el Juzgado; sus contestaciones no eran espontaneas tenian la apariencia de una&nbsp; atestacion estudiada y forzada. Por el contrario, la conducta de la demandadla en el banquillo testifical esa natural, y sus declaraciones son, en opinion del Juzgado, espontaneas y sinceras y llevan el sello de la verdad.&nbsp; Habiendo llegado el Juzgado a esta conclusion, la consignacion (Exh. 'A') hecha por&nbsp; los demandantes del precio de la recompra un ano y once meses despues de haber expirado el plazo para el&nbsp; retracto, es una&nbsp; consignacion hecha fuera de tiempo,&nbsp; y por tanto es improcedente."<br></blockquote>Since the issue involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; of error&nbsp; is one of fact,&nbsp; or&nbsp; one&nbsp; which&nbsp; involves an&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; of the evidence, the&nbsp; same cannot now&nbsp; be&nbsp; looked&nbsp; into since&nbsp; this case was certified to&nbsp; us on&nbsp; purely questions of law.<br><br>It&nbsp; is however contended that even if it be&nbsp; considered that&nbsp; appellants, or&nbsp; their&nbsp; predecessors&nbsp; in&nbsp; interest,&nbsp; have failed to&nbsp; redeem&nbsp; the land within&nbsp; the&nbsp; period&nbsp; stipulated, such&nbsp; failure&nbsp; is&nbsp; of no consequence for the reason&nbsp; that the real contract entered into between&nbsp; appellants' predecessors in interest and appellee is not one&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale with right&nbsp; to repurchase but only an equitable mortgage and so appellants should still be allowed to reacquire the property by paying the obligation&nbsp; that&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; due&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee.&nbsp; And&nbsp; in support of this contention,&nbsp; they&nbsp; advance&nbsp; the following arguments:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; inadequacy&nbsp; of&nbsp; price, that&nbsp; is, the price of the sale is P800.00 when the land sold has an assessed value of P1,710.00; (2) the vendee a retro was given, under the contract,&nbsp; the usufruct of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land during the&nbsp; entire period of redemption; and (3) the contract employs the Spanish term "devolviesemos"&nbsp; when referring to the right of the vendor<span style="font-style: italic;"> a retro</span> to repurchase the property.<br><br>To begin&nbsp;&nbsp; with,&nbsp; the&nbsp; contention&nbsp; that the contract in question involves merely an equitable mortgage is a belated one, for right along appellants have always claimed that the transaction concluded by their predecessors in interest is. one&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; with right to&nbsp; repurchase.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; borne out not only by the original&nbsp; complaint filed by appellants' predecessors in interest on March 13, 1944 but also&nbsp; by the complaint filed&nbsp; by them on June 3,&nbsp; 1950 wherein the same averments of sale&nbsp; with right to&nbsp; repurchase appear.&nbsp; In fact, this is the issue submitted by them to the trial court when this case was originally tried&nbsp; and said court&nbsp; held that&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; contract&nbsp; is&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale with option to repurchase.<br><br>In the second place,&nbsp; the claim regarding inadequacy of price is- insubstantial&nbsp; considering that the&nbsp; transaction in question is a sale with <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>&nbsp; and not an absolute sale.&nbsp; In transactions of this nature, the practice is to fix a relatively reduced price to afford the vendor a retro every facility to redeem the land unlike in an absolute sale where the actual market value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property&nbsp; is considered. At any rate, such a reduced price cannot be considered&nbsp; a ground for&nbsp; annulling the contract, as was held by this Court in a number of cases.&nbsp; Thus, in Feliciano&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Limjuco, 41 Phil., 147,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; laid down&nbsp; the&nbsp; following doctrine:<br><blockquote>"Without deciding that the assessed value of a&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; is its true value on sale,&nbsp; the difference between the price of P500 agreed&nbsp; upon by&nbsp; the parties and the assessed value of P1.010 does not, in the absence of sufficient evidence of the true value, of itself justify the annulment of a sale&nbsp; with the right to repurchase. The testimony of persons interested&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case is no sufficient proof of the value of the&nbsp; land.&nbsp; The price fixed in a sale with, the right to repurchase is not necessarily&nbsp; the&nbsp; true value&nbsp; of the land sold. (De Ocampo y Custodio <i>vs.</i> lim,&nbsp; 38 Phil., 579.)&nbsp; And this must bo true, because&nbsp; in this kind of sale as distinguished from absolute sales in&nbsp; which the vendor, in permanently giving&nbsp; away his property, tries to get,&nbsp; as&nbsp; compensation,&nbsp; its real&nbsp; value, the hope of redeeming the&nbsp; land sold&nbsp; and the&nbsp; facility of&nbsp; returning the price received&nbsp; are important&nbsp; factors and in order that this hope may be realized easily the vendor generally fixes a price&nbsp; less than the real value."<br></blockquote>Finally,&nbsp; the fact that the vendee a retro was given the right to enjoy the usufruct of the&nbsp; land during&nbsp; the period of redemption, far from being a factor favoring an&nbsp; equittable mortgage, is an argument in favor of appellee's theory for&nbsp; usufruct is an element of ownership which&nbsp; is involved in a contract of sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as regards the&nbsp; Spanish term "devolviesemos" employed in the contract, appellants' claim cannot be of any help, for that term in English terminology also conveys the idea&nbsp; of repayment which is in line with a right&nbsp; of repurchase.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Labrador</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br><i>Concepcion, J.,</i>&nbsp; concurs in the result.</div>
