				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioner seeks a review and the&nbsp; setting aside of a resolution in bane of the Court of Industrial Relations adopted on 23 June-1954 which held that there exists no employer-employee relationship&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent and the driver complainants represented by the petitioner and for&nbsp; that&nbsp; reason&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial Relations dismissed the complaint filed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; acting&nbsp; prosecutor of the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The resolution in bane complained of reversed an order of&nbsp; an Associate Judge of the Court which declared that&nbsp; there was&nbsp; such&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; of employer-employee&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; and&nbsp; the complainants represented by the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last mentioned order of 16 February 1954&nbsp; was&nbsp; just&nbsp; interlocutory&nbsp; but&nbsp; it was set aside by the resolution of 23 June 1954.&nbsp; The National Labor&nbsp; Union in representation of the&nbsp; complainants appealed from said resolution dismissing its complaint charging&nbsp; the respondent with the commission of&nbsp; unfair labor practices.<br><br>In the resolution&nbsp; complained of there are&nbsp; no findings of facts, ; It merely&nbsp; states that—<br><blockquote>* * *the Court, in bane,&nbsp; finds that the&nbsp; said motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; is&nbsp; well-taken&nbsp; and, therefore, it hereby reconsider&nbsp; the order of February&nbsp; 16, 1954, and thereby declares that there is no employer-employee relation between&nbsp; respondent, Benedicto Dinglasan, and the driver-complainants in his&nbsp; case.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a consequence, the motion to dismiss the complaint, dated October 31, 1953, filed by the Acting Prosecutor of the Court, is hereby granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annex D.)<br></blockquote>This, resolution was&nbsp; adopted upon&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; previous order&nbsp; of 16 February 1954. As&nbsp; there are no&nbsp; findings of fact in the resolution those, bet&nbsp; forth in the previous order&nbsp; must&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; relied. upon by the Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are as follows:<br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) Respondent Dinglasan is , the&nbsp; owner and&nbsp; operator of TPU jeepneys plying between&nbsp; España-Quiapo-Pier and <i>vice versa.</i><br><br>(<i>b</i>) Petitioners&nbsp; are&nbsp; drivers&nbsp; who&nbsp; had verbal&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; with respondent for the use of the&nbsp; latter's&nbsp; jeepneys upon&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of P7 50 for 10&nbsp; hours use, otherwise known as the "boundary system".<br><br>(<i>c</i>) Said drivers&nbsp; did&nbsp; not receive salaries&nbsp; or wages from Mr. Dinglasan; their day's' earnings&nbsp; being&nbsp; the excess over the P7.50 that they paid .for the&nbsp; use of the jeepneys.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the event&nbsp; that they did not&nbsp; earn&nbsp; more,&nbsp; respondent did not have&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay them anything; <br><br>(d) Mr. Dinglasan's&nbsp; supervision&nbsp; over the&nbsp; drivers&nbsp; consisted&nbsp; in inspection of the&nbsp; jeepneys.&nbsp; that they took out, when&nbsp; they passed his gasoline station for water, checking the route prescribed by tho Public&nbsp; Service Commission,&nbsp; or whether any driver&nbsp; was&nbsp; driving recklessly and washing and changing the tires&nbsp; of jeepneys.&nbsp; (Annex c.) <br></blockquote>The&nbsp; main&nbsp; question to determine is whether there exists a relationship&nbsp; of employer-employee between&nbsp; the drivers of the jeeps and the owner thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; findings contained&nbsp; in the first order&nbsp; are&nbsp; not disputed by both&nbsp; parties except the&nbsp; last to which the respondent&nbsp; took exception. But in the resolution setting aside the order of 16 February 1954 the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations <i>in&nbsp; banc</i> did not state.that such finding is not supported by evidence.&nbsp; It merely "declares that there is no employer-employee&nbsp; relation between respondent, Benedicts Dinglasan, and&nbsp; the driver-complainants in this case."&nbsp;&nbsp; If the findings to which . the&nbsp; respondent took exception is unsupported by&nbsp; the evidence, a pronouncement to that effect would have been made&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Court in&nbsp; bane.&nbsp; In; the absence&nbsp; of such pronouncement we are not at liberty to ignore or disregard said&nbsp; finding.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; findings of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations with respect to question of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record shall be conclusive." <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> Taking into consideration the&nbsp; findings of fact made by the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations we find&nbsp; it difficult to&nbsp; uphold the&nbsp; conclusion of the&nbsp; Court set forth&nbsp; in its resolution of 23&nbsp; June&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; The drivers did not invest a single centavo in the business and the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; is the exclusive owner&nbsp; of the jeeps.&nbsp; The management of&nbsp; the business is in the&nbsp; respondent's hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; For even&nbsp; if&nbsp; the drivers of the jeeps take material possession of the jeeps, still the&nbsp; respondent as owner thereof and holder of a certificate of public convenience is entitled to&nbsp; exercise, as he&nbsp; does&nbsp; and under the law he&nbsp; must, supervision over the drivers by seeing to it that they follow the route prescribed by the Public Service Commission and&nbsp; the rules and regulations promulgated by it&nbsp; as regards their&nbsp; operation.&nbsp; And when they pass by the gasoline&nbsp; station&nbsp; of&nbsp; the respondent checking by Ms employees on the water tank, oil and&nbsp; tire&nbsp; pressure&nbsp; is done.&nbsp; The only&nbsp; features that would make the relationship of lessor&nbsp; and lessee between the&nbsp; respondent and the drivers,&nbsp; members of the&nbsp; union, as contended by the respondent, are the fact that he does not&nbsp; pay them&nbsp; any&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; wage but their compensation is&nbsp; the excess of the total amount of fares earned or collected&nbsp; by them over and above&nbsp; the amount of P7.50 which they agreed to pay to the respondent,&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner of the jeeps, and the fact that the gasoline burned by the jeeps is&nbsp; for the account of the drivers:&nbsp; These two features are not, however, sufficient to withdraw the relationship between them&nbsp; from&nbsp; that of&nbsp; employer-employee,&nbsp; because the&nbsp; estimated earnings for&nbsp; fares must be over&nbsp; and above&nbsp; the amount they agreed to pay to the&nbsp; respondent for&nbsp; a ten hour shift or ten-hour a day operation of the jeeps.&nbsp; Not having any&nbsp; interest in the business because&nbsp; they did&nbsp; not invest anything in the acquisition of the jeeps and did not participate in&nbsp; the&nbsp; management&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; their service as drivers&nbsp; of the&nbsp; jeeps&nbsp; being their only contribution&nbsp; to&nbsp; the business, the relationship of&nbsp; lessor and&nbsp; lessee cannot be sustained.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]&nbsp;</span></sup> In the lease of chattels the&nbsp; lessor loses complete control over&nbsp; the chattel leased&nbsp; although the&nbsp; lessee cannot make bad use thereof, for he would be responsible for damages to the lessor should he do&nbsp; so.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this case there&nbsp; is a&nbsp; supervision&nbsp; and a&nbsp; sort of&nbsp; control&nbsp; that&nbsp; the owner&nbsp; of the jeeps exercises over&nbsp; the drivers. It&nbsp; is an attempt by&nbsp; ingenious scheme to withdraw&nbsp; the&nbsp; relationship between the&nbsp; owner of&nbsp; the jeeps&nbsp; and&nbsp; the. drivers thereof&nbsp; from the operation of the&nbsp; labor laws enacted to promote industrial peace.<br><br>As to the point&nbsp; that the National Labor Union&nbsp; is&nbsp; not the real&nbsp; party in interest to&nbsp; bring the complaint,&nbsp; suffice it to say that " 'representative' includes a legitimate labor .organization or any officer or agent of such&nbsp; organization, whether or&nbsp; not employed&nbsp; by the employer or employees whom he represents." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; And whenever&nbsp; it is' charged by an offended&nbsp; party or his representative that any person has engaged or&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaging in any unfair labor practice, the Court of Industrial Relations must investigate such charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Therefore, the objection to the institution of the charge for unfair labor practice by the&nbsp; National Labor Union is not well taken. <br><br>The order&nbsp; of 23&nbsp; June&nbsp; 1954 is reversed and set aside and the case remanded to the Court of Industrial Relations for such further&nbsp; proceedings as&nbsp; may be required by law, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the respondent.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.
