				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari praying that the writ of execution issued&nbsp; by respondent judge on July&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1955 be set aside on the ground that it was issued in&nbsp; excess of his jurisdiction.<p>This&nbsp; petition stems&nbsp; from&nbsp; a decision&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Pangasinan,&nbsp; presided over by his Honor&nbsp; Emanuel M. Munoz, in two&nbsp; civil cases which were&nbsp; jointly tried upon agreement of the parties on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that they involve&nbsp; the same parties&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; same subject&nbsp; matter&nbsp; (cases Nos. 10374&nbsp; and 12672).&nbsp;&nbsp; Case No. 10374 is&nbsp; for&nbsp; recovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; a parcel of land occupied&nbsp; by Pedro Cerezo while&nbsp; case No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 12672 is&nbsp; for unlawful&nbsp; detainer of the&nbsp; same land&nbsp; brought against&nbsp; the same&nbsp; party.&nbsp; The dispositive part of the decision reads as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>a</em>. In&nbsp; civil case&nbsp; No. 10374,&nbsp; declaring&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; Cornelio Barnachea, Fernanda&nbsp; Corpus,&nbsp; Esteban&nbsp; M.&nbsp; Corpus and&nbsp; Eusebio S. Sison as&nbsp; owners&nbsp; and entitled to the possession of the land described in the complaint in the proportion provided for in their agreement evidenced by&nbsp; Exhibit 'C;&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>b</em>. In&nbsp; civil case No. 12672, the&nbsp; defendant Pedro Cerezo is hereby ordered,&nbsp; after this decision becomes final, to deliver the possession of&nbsp; the land to the plaintiffs;&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>c</em>. In&nbsp; civil case No. 12672, defendant Pedro Cerezo is hereby ordered to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; rentals at the rate of PI 50 a&nbsp; year until&nbsp; possession shall have been delivered to the plaintiffs;&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>d</em>. Also&nbsp; in civil&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 12672, the Provincial Treasurer of Pangasinan is hereby ordered to&nbsp; deliver to the plaintiffs&nbsp; or their . attorney&nbsp; of record, Jose G.&nbsp; del Castillo,&nbsp; the sum of Pl,050 deposited under&nbsp; Official Receipt&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 7534896, dated July&nbsp; 14, 1954; and&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>e</em>. The defendant is hereby sentenced to pay the costs in both cases."</p></blockquote><p>On July&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1955, the plaintiffs&nbsp; in&nbsp; both&nbsp; cases&nbsp; filed a motion&nbsp; for execution of the judgment alleging,&nbsp; among other grounds,&nbsp; that&nbsp; defendant has failed to&nbsp; deposit with the clerk of court the rental of the land for the current year and, therefore, they are&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to take&nbsp; immediate possession of the property pursuant to&nbsp; section 8, Rule 72, of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; This motion was favorably provided for in an order issued on July 29, 1955, which was amended on August 16, 1955, by virtue of a clerical error inadvertently committed, with&nbsp; regard to the beneficiaries of the judgment.&nbsp; And when the court refused to reconsider these orders and to set aside the writ of execution, defendant interposed the present petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari.</span></p><p>It should be&nbsp; noted that respondent&nbsp; judge in granting the&nbsp; motion for execution did not state any&nbsp; particular reason for&nbsp; allowing such execution pending appeal but simply stated that&nbsp; the motion was "well taken and in accordance&nbsp; with law."&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly,&nbsp; the court was referring to&nbsp; paragraph c of the motion which states that "in view of the. failure of the defendant to deposit the rental for the current year,&nbsp; execution&nbsp; may issue to place the plaintiff in possession of the premises&nbsp; pursuant to the&nbsp; provisions of Rule 72,&nbsp; Sections 8 and&nbsp; 9."&nbsp; If such were the case,&nbsp; the question that arises is: Was the court justified&nbsp; in ordering the execution on that ground?&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner contends that this case does not&nbsp; came under Section 8, Rule 72, and&nbsp; we believe that this position is well-taken.</p><p>Note that the judgment which is&nbsp; sought to be executed fixes&nbsp; a yearly&nbsp; rental of&nbsp; P150 which should be paid&nbsp; by defendant until possession of the property is returned to the plaintiffs.&nbsp;&nbsp; No damages were assessed against defendant because, with regard to the rentals&nbsp; for&nbsp; the previous years, which amount to P1,050, the same have already been deposited in court even before rendition&nbsp; of the judgment. Not being&nbsp; a monthly&nbsp; rental what defendant is required to deposit in court, section 8, Rule 72 does not&nbsp; apply, for, as this Court aptly said: "This rule contemplates payment of a monthly rental the failure of which would give rise to execution, and&nbsp; not the payment of rental in any other manner.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; present&nbsp; case, the&nbsp; rental&nbsp; fixed by the justice of the&nbsp; peace court is not monthly but yearly, and this is understandable considering the fact that the property subject of lease is a fishpond.&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; As it now appears the rental fixed by the court is not yet due and, therefore, the order&nbsp; of execution issued by the respondent judge&nbsp; is premature." (Victor de la Cruz <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Honorable Ambrosio T.&nbsp; Dollete, et al., 96&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 797).&nbsp; Since the rental&nbsp; which defendant has&nbsp; allegedly failed to deposit&nbsp; is for the "current year", it is evident that; based on this ground, the writ of&nbsp; execution is premature.</p><p>It is true that under Section 2, Rule 39 the trial court may also order that "before&nbsp; the expiration of the time to appeal", in the exercise of its discretion,&nbsp; a writ of execution be issued "on motion of the prevailing party&nbsp; with notice&nbsp; to the adverse party upon good reasons to be stated in a special order",&nbsp; and that,&nbsp; even in that eventuality, execution may be stayed "upon the&nbsp; approval by the court of a sufficient supersedeas bond filed by the appellant, conditioned&nbsp; for the performance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment or order appealed from",&nbsp; but the&nbsp; writ of execution in question cannot be justified even under the above&nbsp; provision of the rules for the order of the court does not&nbsp; state the "good reasons" that may justify such departure from the normal course of appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the reasons justifying such action may be gathered from other pleadings&nbsp; appearing in the record, we fail to find any in this particular instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are therefore persuaded to conclude that the respondent judge&nbsp; has&nbsp; acted in excess&nbsp; of his&nbsp; jurisdiction when&nbsp; he granted the&nbsp; writ of execution under the circumstances obtaining in this&nbsp; case.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; petition is granted, with&nbsp; costs against&nbsp; respondents, other than respondent judge.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
