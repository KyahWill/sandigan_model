				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo, Hon. 
Hilarion Y. Jarencio, presiding, finding Porfirio Taño, Guillermo Camina and 
Roman Caldito guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery in Band 
with Rape, and sentencing each of them to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em>, and to indemnify jointly and severally the offended parties in 
the amount of P210.00, and also finding Dionisio Cantong and Maximino Calico 
guilty of the crime of simple robbery in band and sentencing them also for said 
offense. Porfirio Tano and Dionisio Cantong appealed from the judgment, but 
while the case was pending in this Court, the latter withdrew his appeal. The 
present appeal, therefore, refers to that of Porfirio Taño.
<p>It is not disputed by the appellant, as found in the decision appealed from, 
that on July 25, 1955, at 8:00 in the evening, some persons called at the house 
of the spouses Leodegario Domingo and Herminigilda Domingo in barrio Talacuan, 
municipality of Loon, province of Iloilo, informing the inmates of the house 
that there was a letter for Leodegario. As soon as Leodegario reached the 
ground, carrying a lamp with him, Camina struck his hand holding the lamp and 
the lamp fell down and the light was put out. Then Taño pointed a rifle at 
Leodegario, while Camina tied his hands at the back. After giving a blow on the 
face of Leodegario, Taño ordered his companions to take Leodegario to the river 
bank 40 meters away. Then Taño, Camina and Caldito went up the house, each 
carrying with him a firearm. They searched the house, and upon seeing a trunk 
forced it open and took away some pieces of men's and women's apparel and an 
envelope containing P210.00.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that after the money had been taken away Taño dragged 
Herminigilda, pushing her down the floor. Taño then placed himself on top of 
Herminigilda, while his companions held her legs apart. He gave a blow at her 
left thigh and tore her "panty" away and then had intercourse with her. After 
this Camina also had access to her, while his companions held her down. Caldito 
also did this. After raping her, they went down the house and, thereafter, all 
of them ran away.</p>
<p>Counsel for appellant Taño argues that there is no sufficient evidence to 
sustain the finding that appellant had access to the offended party, for the 
reason that the physician who examined her made no examination of her private 
parts. That no such examination was made is true; the physician who examined 
Herminigilda found a contusion on the face of her left thigh (Exhibit "M"), but 
made no mention of having examined her private parts or having found evidence 
involving intercourse forced on her.</p>
<p>We have, however, carefully examined the evidence in this respect and we 
found that Herminigilda testified that when Taño placed himself on top of her, 
she scratched his face, but Camina came and took hold of, and then stretched her 
legs apart to aid Taño; that Taño hit her on the lap and tore away her "panty"; 
that her "panty" had a coloration at the lower part caused by the semen of Taño 
while on top of her (t.s.n. pp. 16-18). Her testimony is corroborated by the 
finding of a contusion on her left thigh and of a coloration of her "panty" 
which was produced to the court. Besides, the offended party expressly declared 
that Taño was able to have carnal knowledge of her (Id, pp. JS-19). It is a 
well-known fact that women, especially Filipinos, would not admit that they have 
been abused unless that abuse had actually happened. This is due to their 
natural instinct to protect their honor. We can not believe that the offended 
party would have positively stated that intercourse took place unless it did 
actually take place.</p>
<p>Another circumstance which supports the claim that rape was committed is the 
fact that following the day of the commission of the crime of rape, the offended 
party stated in her affidavit that the three accused, including appellant Taño, 
had taken turns in committing the crime of rape on her. The imputation of rape 
is not, therefore, the prpduct of fabrication, because no appreciable time had 
elapsed between the commission of the rape and the execution of tile 
affidavit.</p>
<p>Lastly, the trial judge who heard the offended party testify believed her 
testimony and found that rape was actually committed. We find nothing to 
indicate that the court's findings in this respect are not correct. We are, 
therefore, forced to the conclusion that the claim of appellant Taño that the 
rape imputed to him was not sufficiently proved, is without merit.</p>
<p>We also agree with the trial court that four aggravating circumstances, 
namely, commission by a band, taking advantage of nighttime and dwelling, and 
use of superior strength attended the commission of the offense. There being no 
mitigating circumstance in appellant's favor, the penalty should be imposed in 
its maximum degree.</p>
<p>The judgment of conviction appealed from should, therefore, be as it hereby 
affirmed. With costs against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angela, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
