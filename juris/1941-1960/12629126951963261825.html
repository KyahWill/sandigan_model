				<H3>PHILIPPINE  LAND-AIR-SEA  LABOR  UNION   (PLASLU), EMILIO LUMONTAD, CONSOLADA M. LUMONTAD, EMILIO M.  LUMONTAD, JR. AND RODRIGO  JAMERO, PETITIONERS, VS.  HON. MONTANO A.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original action for certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction, seeking to annul the  decision of the respondent Judge,  dated May  30, 1956,  denying petitioner's motions  to  dismiss, in Civil  Case Nos. 26  and 436  in the Court of First Instance  of Agusan, and his order dated August  18, 1956,  denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration. <br><br>Petitioner Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union  (PLASLU) is a  labor organization and  the  other petitioners are the elected officers  thereof, while respondent  Saturnino Betangcor is a member of the Union PLASLU.  On October 6, 1955, respondent Betangcor filed in the Court of First Instance  of Agusan Civil  Case  No. 26  for  mandamus against the petitioners, as officers of  the  PLASLU, to compel them to issue receipts for  all  his payments, to the Union,  in the  form of "voluntary contributions as well as  other  assessments," and  to  "render  an accounting of the  Union funds  as well as to make all records of the financial  activities of the  Union available  for inspection to the members thereof"; and Civil Case No. 436, to annul the election of the petitioners as officers of the PLASLU,  on the ground  that he, Betangcor, and the other members of the Union NASIPIT CHAPTER, were not allowed to participate  in  said  election  in violation of  the  Union's constitution and by-laws. <br><br>Acting  upon motions to dismiss filed by the petitioners, on the ground  that the Court of First Instance of Agusan had no jurisdiction, respondent Judge rendered the decision now sought to be annulled,  holding that this court had jurisdiction over the two cases,  and claiming  that the two cases did not involve  any  labor dispute, but only an intramural  dispute  between a member and the  officers of  a labor union; that neither did  they involve any unfair labor practice; consequently, the Court of Industrial Relations had no jurisdiction, this aside from the fact that only one member of a labor union filed the two cases, whereas Section 17 of Republic Act No. 875  required  a minimum of ten per cent of the members to report any alleged violation  of internal labor organization procedures. <br><br>This same question  has already been  submitted to and decided by this Court,  for which reason, we do not deem it necessary to discuss it  at length.  In the case of Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa Manila Railroad, et al., <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Paulino Bugay and the  Court of Industrial Relations, 101 Phil., 18; 54 Off. Gaz., [38], 8622, which involved the illegal expulsion of a member of his labor union, we held that under Section 17 of Republic  Act No. 875, questions involving the rights and conditions  of membership in a labor organization fall within the jurisdiction  of the Court of Industrial Relations. Under said section, a union member, among other things, shall be given a receipt  by the union officer for any collection  of any fees, dues, or  other contributions,  and  the books of accounts and other records  of the  financial  activities of a labor organization shall be open to inspection  by any officer or member thereof.  Said section also provides that members of a labor union shall  have the right to elect the officers by secret ballot.  Inasmuch as the issues included in the  two  civil cases in question involve the  right of  a member in  a labor organization as above mentioned,  said cases naturally come within  the  exclusive jurisdiction of the  Court  of  Industrial Relations,  not in  the  ordinary courts, such as the  Court  of First Instance.  It  is  true that Section 17 of Republic Act No. 875  requires a  minimum of ten per cent of the members to make a report or complaint with the Court of Industrial Relations,  of an alleged violation of the procedures in their organization, but  in  the  aforecited  case  decided by  this  Court, supra, we also held:          <br><blockquote>"Of course, the tirst paragraph  of  section 17 provides that  a minimum of ten per cent (10%) of the members of a labor organization may report to the CIR an alleged  violation of these procedures in the labor organization.   But there is reason to believe that said minimum of 10% refers only to  violations which involve  a  group or a sizeable  number of the members  in which  the latter are interested, or which necessarily affect  them;  such  as paragraph (b) about detailed reports from the officers of the union of all  financial transactions;  or  paragraph (c) about  the right to elect officers at intervals of not more than two years and to determine and vote upon questions involving major  policies  affecting the entire membership of the organization;  or paragraph  (h)  about the application of the funds of the  organization only  for those purposes expressly  stated in the constitution or by-laws, etc.  However,  when a violation like the supposed  illegal  expulsion of a member affect only the member so expelled, or under paragraph  (a) an excessive fine is  imposed only  upon one member; or  under paragraph (c)  one member is deprived of his  right to  vote  by secret ballot  in the election  of officers of the union; or under paragraphs (f)  and (g) an  officer collects  from  a member any fees or dues or  contributions without authority pursuant to the constitution, and by-laws, or  refuses  to issue a  receipt to a  member from, whom any fees, dues or other contributions  are  collected, etc., then it is not necessary that 10% of such members of the union make the report or complaint to the CIR, but only the  member immediately affected may do so." </blockquote>In the civil  cases filed  by respondent  Betangcor,  it is claimed that the officers of the  Union failed or refused to issue him  receipts for payments of contributions  and other assessments paid by him, was not allowed to participate in the election of officers of the Union, and evidently was not permitted to inspect the books of accounts  and other records of the  financial  activities   of  the Union, all of which come within the exceptions pointed out by us in the above quotation. Moreover, even if the non-participation in the election of  officers and the inspection of the books and records of the Union were made in general, and  only in particular to respondent Betangcor, and therefore, did  not  fall within the exceptions, it should not be too difficult for him to, persuade ten  per cent of his fellow union members  to join  him  in filing  the  corresponding complaint or  complaints with the  Court of  Industrial Relations,  in order  to enforce their rights as union members. <br><br>One reason, in our  opinion, why cases  involving the rights and conditions of membership in a  labor  union or organization are placed within the  exclusive jurisdiction of the  Court of Industrial  Relations is  that said court is in a better  position and is more qualified than ordinary courts to determine  said  cases, dealing as it does  with problems  of management and labor,  the latter represented by labor unions,  the  activities of  such labor organizations and  their members,  certification  elections  to  determine the labor unions as  a bargaining  agency to deal and negotiate  with the management, etc.                               <br><br>In  view of the  foregoing, finding  that the  Court of First Instance of Agusan had no jurisdiction over Civil Cases Nos. 26 and 436, the order or decision of respondent judge denying the  motions  for  dismissal  is hereby set aside;  and  granting the  present  petition  for  certiorari and  prohibition,  the  writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued enjoining respondent Judge "from proceeding with the hearing of Civil Cases Nos. 26 and 436 of the Court of First Instance of Agusan" is hereby made permanent.  Respondent Saturnino Betangcor will pay the costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
