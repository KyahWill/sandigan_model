				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original  petition  for mandamus.  The petitioner prays this court to issue the writ "directed to the respondent, Far Eastern Broadcasting, commanding it that the petitioner be allowed to broadcast any speech or address without previous censorship."  The allegations of the petition are as  follows:<br><br><blockquote>"1.  That  the petitioner is of legal age,  resident of the City of Manila and campaign manager of the political party Popular Front Sumulong; the respondent is a public utility corporation engaged in  radio broadcasting  service, and organized and existing in and  under the laws of the Philippines, having its principal office in the Insular Life Building, Manila.<br><br>"2.  That, sometime  in  September,  1941, the petitioner, as  campaign manager  of the  Popular  Front Sumulong, asked the respondent,  through its manager, for the purchase of air time for the broadcast of the Popular  Front political  speeches at the  Opera House on September 23, 1941.  But  the  said respondent refused and  still refuses to allow to broadcast  except on  condition that  complete manuscript of contemplated speeches should be submitted in advance.<br><br>"3.  That  the act of the respondent in refusing to allow the use of  its station for broadcasting the  speeches except upon  prior submission of  complete  manuscript of  the speeches to be broadcast is discriminatory and constitutes unlawful censorship and a  violation of the  freedom  of speech guaranteed by our Constitution.<br><br>"4.  That at present the constitutional guarantees are not suspended, the state not  being placed under  martial law, and, consequently, the conduct  of the respondent is unlawful.<br><br>"5. That the respondent, in  refusing to allow the petitioner to use its station except upon prior censorship, unlawfully excludes and  deprives the latter from the  enjoyment and exercise of the right  and freedom of speech.<br><br>"6. That the petitioner  has  no  other plain,  speedy or adequate  remedy  to enforce  his  right  other  than  this action."<br></blockquote><br>To  that petition the respondent answered as  follows:<br><br><blockquote>"1. That the respondent is a corporation organized and existing according to the laws of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and in its aforesaid capacity owner and  operator of stations KZRM, KZRF  and KZUM by virtue of a specific  franchise granted under Act No. 3180.<br><br>"2. That with reference to the purchase of air time mentioned in paragraph 2 of the petition, the  respondent required the petitioner to submit a  manuscript of contemn plated speeches in advance of the broadcast in the exercise of a right granted by existing laws and regulations and in compliance with  its obligation expressly undertaken to safeguard public morality and  to broadcast programs that are educational, entertaining and not prejudicial to  public interest.<br><br>"3. That the act of the respondent mentioned in paragraph 2 hereof is not discriminatory for it is applied to all persons alike, and not violative of the constitutional provision regarding freedom of speech.<br><br>"4. That the act of the respondent mentioned in  paragraph 2 hereof does not signify unlawful censorship and neither  does it mean that it will refuse to furnish the petitioner with air time because the latter merely refused to submit its speeches and never came back.<br><br>"5. That mandamus should not issue in the above entitled case because the facts alleged in the petition do not warrant the same, the act  of the respondent not constituting an unlawful exclusion of the petitioner from the use and enjoyment of a right to which it is entitled.<br><br>"6. That mandamus is not the proper remedy in the instant case."</blockquote><br>The case hinges on whether the petitioner  has a clear legal  right to broadcast any speech over one of the radio stations owned and operated by the respondent without first submitting the manuscript, and whether  there is a corresponding duty devolved by law upon the respondent to permit the petitioner to do so.<br><br>We note at the outset that the respondent did not actually refuse to sell air  time to  the petitioner.  It required the petitioner to submit the script of the speeches to be  broadcasted, and the petitioner refused to do so.  So the question narrows down to  whether or not the Far Eastern Broad- casting has the right to require the submission of the script. Section 2 of Act No. 3180, which is the franchise of the respondent  corporation, provides that  the broadcasting service shall be  open to the  general  public subject  to the general regulations of the grantee for the allotment of time and the class of communications acceptable for broadcasting.  Commonwealth Act No. 98 created a  Radio Board, among the duties of which is "to censor  all programs, sustaining or sponsored, to be broadcasted or rebroadcasted by all broadcasting stations."  Section 2 of said Act provides that pending the appointment of the Radio Board by the President, the Secretary of the Interior  "shall  examine all programs, sustaining or sponsored, of all broadcasting stations with  the power "to eliminate or cancel  from the program such number or parts thereof as in his opinion are neither moral, educational nor entertaining, and prejudicial to public interest."  Section  3 provides  that "any licensee or owner of broadcasting station who shall  broadcast any program or parts  thereof not duly approved or  otherwise eliminated, by the  Secretary of the Interior or the Radio Board, shall, upon  his or its recommendation,  as the case may be, forfeit his license."<br><br>Pursuant to said Act, the  Secretary of the Interior, on November 18, 1936, promulgated  Department Order No. 13. Paragraph 4 of said order requires all broadcasting stations  to  submit  daily  to the Secretary  of the Interior  at least  twenty-four  hours in advance of  the  actual  broadcasting hour, two copies of all programs to be broadcasted by the stations.  Paragraph 6 provides that "if a program contains any speeches,   *  *  *  copies of these or a gist thereof, may be required by the Secretary of the Interior to be submitted together with the program.<br><br>The respondent denies that its requirement that the petitioner submit the script of the speeches to be broadcasted was discriminatory, asserting that "it is applied to all persons alike"; and the petitioner has not adduced any proof of its allegation.<br><br>It seems clear from the laws and regulations herein before adverted to that the respondent had the right to require the petitioner to submit the manuscript of the speeches  which he intended to broadcast.   In his memorandum, counsel for the respondent sustains, and cites numerous authorities in support of his contention, that Commonwealth Act No. 98 is valid as a proper exercise by the state of its police power.  However, we are  not called upon here to inquire into the constitutionality and validity  of said Act, which  directly governs this case,  because the petitioner has not specifically raised that question, and the general rule is that the constitutionality of a law will not be considered unless the point is specially  pleaded, insisted upon, and adequately argued. (11 Am. Jur., 774; 16 C. J. S.,  220-221; 1 Cooley, Constitutional  limitations, 8th ed., 338.)  "The  basic principle which underlies the entire field of legal concepts pertaining to the validity of legislation is that by enactment of legislation, a constitutional measure  is presumed to be created." (11 Am. Jur., Constitutional Law, sec. 128.)<br><br>The  petitioner  argues  that the broadcasting  of  the speeches of the candidates of the Sumulong Popular Front Party in the evening of September  23, 1941,  could not by any means offer any danger to public safety or public morality, and that the respondent was not justified "to previously censor and approve the complete texts of the speeches of said candidates before allowing the same to be broadcasted in its station."  The best proof, the  petitioner asserts, that there was not the slightest danger to public peace and order was that the speeches  that were delivered in  the Opera House in the evening of September 23, 1941, were heard by the vast audience and published in some newspapers without causing a single untoward incident.  We fail to perceive the cogency of such argument.  It does not bolster up the case for the petitioner.  It impliedly admits—and correctly, we think—that a speech that may endanger public safety may be censored and disapproved for broadcasting. How could the censor verify the petitioner's claim that the speeches he intended to broadcast offered no danger to public safety  or public morality,  if the petitioner refused to submit the manuscript or even the  gist thereof?  If the petitioner  had complied with respondent's requirement and the respondent had arbitrarily and  unreasonably  refused to permit  said speeches to be  broadcasted, he might have reason to  complain.<br><br>We find that it  is  not the duty of the respondent as a public service corporation to  broadcast speeches without requiring the submission of the manuscript thereof in advance, but that, on  the contrary, the laws and regulations expressly authorize the respondent to  make such requirement.   Hence the  petition for mandamus  must  be,  as it hereby  is, denied,  with cost  against  the  petitioner.  So ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abad Santos, Diaz, Moran,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ</span>., concur.</div>
