				<H3>VICTORIANO ENRIQUEZ, PETITIONER, VS. BENEDICTO PADILLA AND HON. ALFONSO FELIX, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is a petition for the mandamus to have the Honorable Alfonso Felix, 
Judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila, certify and approve the record 
on appeal in civil case No. 71066 of the court.</p>
<p>It appears that in the early part of December, 1941, the petitioner was given 
by Benedicto Padilla, one of the respondents, an option to buy a house and lot 
situated at No. 23 Tangab, Santa Mesa heights Subdivision, Quezon City, for 
P8,000. The prospective purchaser did not exercise this option within the 
prescribed period; he sought to do so 1945, after liberation of Manil. When the 
owner refused to execute a deed of sale on the ground that the period of option 
had expired, suit was brought on August 16, 1945.</p>
<p>During the pendency of the action, Andres Concepcion. Deputy Clerk, in an 
undated notice summoned the attorneys and their clients for a conference with 
the Judge who was taking cognizance of the case, on February 27, 1946, in his 
chamber, for an amicable settlement of the case. The parties and their 
respective attorneys having appeared on the designated date, proposals and 
counter-proposals were made, as a result of which Judge Felix rendered a decisio 
of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After this case had been submitted for decision, the parties, assisted by 
their respective attorneys, appeared and informed the court that they have come 
to an understanding and entered into the following agreement:</p>
<p>"1. That the defendant Benedicto Padilla shall give, as he does give, the 
plaintiff an opportunity to purchase from him lot No. 6, block No. 166, of the 
Sta. Mesa Heights Subdivision, of an area of 240 square meters, together with 
the improvementd existing thereon, mmore particularly described in transfer 
certificate of title, No. 1711 of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City (Exhibit 
4) and located at No. 23 Tangab, Santa Mesa Heights, Quezon City, at a price to 
be determined later in the manner hereinafter prescribed;</p>
<p>"2. That, in consideration of this attitude of the defendant, the parties to 
this case have agreed that a commission of assessors be appointed by the court 
to appraise and determine the actual and reasonable market price of the property 
mentioned in the preceding No. 1, and for this purpose they suggest the names of 
the following real estate brokers to compose said commission, to wit:</p><p></p><blockquote><blockquote>"Mr. Federico Calero<br>"Mr. Macario Arabejo<br>"Mr. M. S. Balatbat<br>"Mr. 
Pedro R. Revilla<br>"Mr. Cipriano 
Gonzales<p></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
</blockquote></blockquote><p>"3. That these commissioners, separetely and independently, shall immediately 
proceed to assess said property and to submit their assessment in writing and 
under oath to this court not later than 30 days from the date of this 
decision;</p>
<p>"4. That for the services rendered by said commissioners they be requested to 
accept a compensation of P100 each, or P500 in all, the same to be spportioned 
by the parties in equal amount, and to meet this expense both plaintiff and 
defendant bind themsleves ro deposit with the Clerk of this court, within ten 
(10) days from the date of this decision, the sum of P250 each;</p>
<p>"5. That in the event that any of the commissioners should decline to accept 
the appointment, the parties shall immediately suggest to the court the names of 
other real estate brokers that might substitute and take the place of the 
commissioner who shall refuse to assist the parties and the Court in this 
case;</p>
<p>"6. That on the basis of the appraisals submitted by the commissioners and of 
the reasons given in their support, the court shall determine and fix the 
reasonable actual market value that the plaintiff shall have to pay as purchase 
price of said property, which decision shall be final and binding upon the 
parties;</p>
<p>"7. That the price thus fixed by the court shall be final, unappealable and 
binding upon the parties to this case;</p>
<p>"8. That, within 15 days from the receipt by the parties of the valuation 
made by the Court of the property in question, the defendant shall execute the 
corresponding deed of sale and conveyance of said property in favor of the 
plaintiff, who within the same period of 15 days and upon the execution of said 
deed shall fully pay to the defendant in cash the price fixed by the Court for 
the property;</p>
<p>"9. That the sum of P2,000. paid by the plaintiff in 1941 for the option 
granted him by the defendant and the sum of P200.00 recently delivered by the 
plaintiff to the defendant shall be appllied to the payment of rents and said 
property from December 1, 1941, up to the date of his acquisition of said 
property, at the monthly rental of P80, with the exception of the period of the 
Japanese occupation of Manila (January of 1942 to January of 1945, inclusive), 
in which the rent shall be of P40, and the period from November 1, 1945, up to 
the time of the execution by the defendant of said deed of sale, in which the 
rent shall be the monthly sum of P192, equivalent to Â½of 2O per cent 
of the assessed value of the property, which is P11,520;</p>
<p>"10. That as the sum of P2,200 referred to in the preceding paragraph is only 
sufficient to pay the rates of rents agreed upon up to September 30, 1945, the 
plaintiff shall pay to the defendant, not later than March 15, 1946, the sum of 
P848 as rents due for the last quarter of 1945 and for January and February of 
1946, and shall continue to pay the monthly rent of P192 for March and 
succeeding months of this year (up to the date of his acquisition of the 
property), within the first ten (10) days of the mouth following that for which 
the rent shall become due and payable;</p>
<p>"11. That the provisions of paragraphs 9 and 10 hereof shall be complied with 
even in the case that plaintiff shall fail to purchase said defendant's 
property;</p>
<p>"12. That if, upon knowing the value of the property as fixed by this Court, 
the plaintiff shall be unwilling or unable to pay for the purchase price 
thereof, then the plaintiff shall waive any right that he may have to purchase 
defendant's property and <em>shall vacate the premises within three months</em> 
from the date that, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 8 hereof, he 
should have purchased said property, unless the parties herein should enter into 
another lease agreement for the same;</p>
<p>"13. That the rent of said property for the period of three months referred 
to in the preceding paragraph shall be the same sum of P192 monthly, payable in 
the same manner as provided for in paragraph 10 hereof;</p>
<p>"14. That in case the plaintiff shall fail to purchase the property in 
question, then the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of P500 for the 
grills placed by the latter in said premises;</p>
<p>"15. That the plaintiff does not claim to have any other improvement made in 
the premises;</p>
<p>"16. That both parties waive their right to appeal this case to the higher 
court; and</p>
<p>"17. That the parties submit this agreement for approval of the Court and 
pray that judgment be rendered in accordance with the terms thereof.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the court hereby approves the preceding agreement and, as prayed 
for, renders judgment in accordance with the terms thereof, without special 
pronouncement as to costs." </p></blockquote>
<p>The five real estate brokers who had been appointed in line with the above 
decision submitted separate and independent reports of appraisal on different 
dates from March 14 to April 1, inclusive, 1946, and the respondent Judge on 
April 13 promulgated a supplementary decision which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Commissioners on Appraisal have already submitted their assessment of 
the market value of the property involved in this case, located at No. 23 
Tangab, Santa Mesa Heights, Quezon City, covered by Transfer Certificate of 
title No. 1711 (Exhibit 4) of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City. The 
respective valuations made by the Commissioners of said lot, building and 
improvements thereon are as follows:</p>

<p>"Considering the grounds on which the respective valuations are made by the 
Commissioners and that Messrs. Arabejo and Gonzales coincide in the amount of 
P16,000; that tile basis for their valuation is sound; and considering further 
the reasons adduced by Commissioners Calero and Revilla, and based on the 
average of the valuations submitted, that practically gives the same result, the 
Court, in conformity with the provisions of paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement 
of the parties embodied in the decision rendered in this case, hereby declares 
that the present and reasonable market value of the property in question is 
P16,000.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, let the parties comply with the provisions of paragraph 8 of 
their agreement as incorporated in said decision."</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the appeal, from these decisions that the respondent Judge refused to 
allow, on the ground that they are unappealable by the terms of the parties' 
agreement.</p>
<p>We have held that "a judgment on compromise is not appealable and is 
immediately executory unless a motion is filed to set aside the compromise on 
the ground of fraud, mistake or duress, in which event an appeal may be taken 
from the order denying the motion." (Anita de los Reyes vs. De Ugarte, 75 Phil., 
505; <em>see also</em> 2 Amer. Juris., 975.)</p>
<p>The pertinent parts of the petition are paragraphs V and VI which read as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That then and there, the respondent Judge called one of his stenographers 
and begun dictating a series of stipulations; after which dictation, the herein 
petitioner left the court in the belief that he would be furnished with a copy 
of the said stipulations for revision and whatever suggestion he might propose 
for the consideration of the said court and the adverse party to be incorporated 
in the proposed agreement;</p>
<p>"That contrary to his expectation, the respondent Judge rendered a decision 
dated February 27, 1946, based on the stipulations he had dictated to his 
stenographer without giving this representation an opportunity to revise or 
propose any amendment thereto and for this reason, this representation filed a 
motion for reconsideration on A pril 1, 1946, containing the suggestions he 
desired to propose as a part of the said stipulations; that he had not been 
furnished with, a copy of said stipulations; and had net in fact agreed to some 
of the conditions stated therein." </p></blockquote>
<p>The main question presented to us for decision has to do with the truth or 
falsity of these allegations. It is entirely a question of fact.</p>
<p>The petitioner has attached to his petition only a copy of the notice of the 
deputy clerk of court above referred to. Among other papers lacking, copies of 
the motions for reconsideration and the court's orders denying them, which we 
would be curious to know and which might shed some light on the question at 
issue, are conspicuous by their absence. The copies of the decisions which have 
been transcribed herein have been furnished not by the petitioner but the 
respondents.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, we should 'be inclined to refer the matter to a 
coivmiissioner for reception of evidence on the disputed facts. However, the 
petitioner has not made enough showing to warrant such procedure. In fact the 
petitioner has not only failed to make a <em>prima facie</em> case but some of 
his averments carry their own refutation or appear upon their face to be 
untenable.</p>
<p>There is no allegation in the petition denying the correctness of the 
passages in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the main decision, namely, that the parties 
had agreed that "the court shall determine and fix. the reasonable actual market 
value that the plaintiff shall have to pay as purchase price of said property, 
which decision shall be final and binding upon the parties," and that "the price 
thus fixed by the court shall be final, unappealable and binding upon the 
parties to this case." We also gather from a reading of the petition an implied 
admission that a stipulation of facts to be embodied in the said decision was in 
truth made. And in impugning the decision, the petitioner does not now specify 
the parts thereof to which he says he did not agree. What he does is to make a 
general statement that he "had not in fact agreed to some of the conditions 
stated therein." But not even such unspecific imputation of errors appears to 
have been placed by him before the Judge who had signed the decision. Paragraph 
VII of the petition states that a motion for reconsideration was presented 
"containing suggestions and proposals to be incorporated in the proposed 
agreement. * * *"</p>
<p>The petitioner says that the Judge "began dictating a series of 
stipulations," after which he left Judge Felix's private chamber "in the belief 
that he ivould be furnished with a copy of said stipulations for revision and 
whatever suggestion he might propose for the consideration of the said court and 
the adverse party to be incorporated in the proposed agreement."</p>
<p>We are unable to believe this statement; it is illogical, contrary to what a 
normal person in petitioner's position would have done. Being vitally interested 
in the proceeding that was going on, it would have been unnatural for him to 
walk away before the proceeding was over or a definite understanding had been 
reached. It must be remembered at this juncture that the law was against the 
plaintiff in the main case, although he might have some equity on his side, and 
that the Judge endeavored to prevail upon the defendant Padilla to sell the 
questioned property to said plaintiff with a modification of some of the terms, 
primarily for his (petitioner's) benefit. Quite apart from all this, the 
presiding Judge, after having exerted efforts to have the parties come to an 
agreement could hardly have allowed the petitioner to leave the conference 
before a settlement had been concluded or before every hope for such a 
settlement had been given up. The insinuation that the Judge permitted the 
petitioner to quit the conference and agreed to send him a copy of the decision 
for him to muse and meditate upon, without setting a time within which the 
petitioner should make up his mind, does not seem plausible.</p>
<p>That the decision was the result of a definite and final agreement between 
the parties without reserving to either of them the right to retrocede or 
propose changes is borne out by the deposit by the petitioner of P250 
representing one-half of the compensation to be paid the appraisers in 
accordance with paragraph 4 of the said decision. Proofs leading to the same 
result are the allegations in the answer of the respondents, not denied by the 
petitioner in his answer, that"under paragraph 9 (of the decision) petitioner 
inserted the sum of P200 which he had recently delivered to respondent owner," 
that "in paragraph 14 petitioner inserted the sum of P500 as the value of the 
grills lie had placed on the premises," and that one of the commissioners was 
named by him.</p>
<p>The petitioner's reaction, to the decision did not tie up with his assertion 
that it includes onerous conditions and terms to which he did not give his 
assent. We notice that he received a copy of the decision on March 12, according 
to his reply to the respondent's answer, if indeed he did not learn of it 
earlier. Yet he did not move, as far as his petition would show, until April 11 
(he says April 1 in his petition)-a lapse of 29 days-when he filed a motion for 
reconsideration. And, as has been stated before, that motion for reconsideration 
did not appear to have pointed out any misstatements or inaccuracies in the 
decision; it was limited to proposing new matters for incorporation into the 
decision.</p>
<p>The most charitable view to take of the petitioner's case is that he was 
disappointed at the appraisals made by the real estate brokers and not because 
of any omission from the decision of essential particulars of the stipulations 
or inclusion therein of unapprovect details. We are supported in this belief by 
the length of time it took the petitioner to file his first motion for 
reconsideration; by the fact that it was filed only after the submission of the 
last report of the appraisers, and by the fact that in another motion he 
suggested the appointment of a new set of appraisers to be composed of the city 
engineer, the city auditor and the city assessor, in lieu of the real estate 
brokers who had already finished the work entrusted to them, impeaching the 
technical qualifications of the latter, although, as above seen, one of them was 
of his own selection and lie had contributed one-half of the money which had 
been paid them as compensation.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to decide whether the appeal was filed within or without 
the period provided by the Rules of Court, in view of the foregoing 
conclusion.</p>
<p>The petition is dismissed with costs against the petitioner.</p>
