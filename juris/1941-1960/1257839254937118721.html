D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case was filed by the United Employees Welfare Association, respondent 
herein, with the Court of Industrial Relations on June 23, 1953, to secure the 
reinstatement of two pinboys, Avelino Morada and Godofredo Castel, alleged to 
have been illegally dismissed by the Isaac Peral Bowling Alley, petitioner 
herein, by reason of membership in the respondent association. Petitioner 
herein, opposed the motion for reinstatement alleging that the termination of 
the services of the said two pinboys was brought about by just and valid causes 
and never for union activities as alleged in the motion. After hearing, the 
Court of Industrial Relations in a decision dated January 19, 1959 ordered that 
the said pinboys, Morada and Castel, be reinstated with back wages from the time 
of their suspension or dismissal to November 6, 1958, with deduction for any 
amount earned by them during the period of said suspension or dismissal. From 
this decision, which was affirmed by the court <em>en banc</em>, the Isaac Peral 
Bowling Alley prosecuted the present appeal.</p>
<p>The Court below conducted a hearing and made the following findingsâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After a careful perusal of the evidence submitted by both parties in this 
case, this Court finds the following facts to be undisputed; that Avelino Morado 
and Godofredo Castel worked for respondent Isaac Peral Bowling Alley as pinboys 
from 1951 to June 22, 1953 when their services were terminated by the respondent 
company; that Antonio Martinez and Pedro Cedano were likewise employed in the 
respondent company as pinboy and janitor, respectively, with the former still 
working while the latter resigned recently; that Morado and Castel were the 
chapter president and auditor, respectively, of petitioner United Employees 
Welfare Association while still working, and that Martinez and Cedano were 
non-union members; that on June 18, 1953 at about 4:00 P.M. at the back of the 
respondent company, an altercation and a near fight occurred between Morado and 
Castel, on the one hand, and Martinez and Cedano, on the other; that the main 
cause of the said altercation and controversy was Morado's taking and Infante's 
using a bicycle of Martinez who resented what they did, then resulting in a hot 
exchange of words between the parties involved; that an actual physical fight 
with knives and lead pipe between the two groups did not take place as a 
consequence, as one group tried to challenge the other to avoid a fight; that 
immediately after the aforesaid incident, the protagonists were brought to the 
Manila Police Department (Precinct No- 4) for investigation and were released 
thereafter; that on June 19, 1953. the parties were investigated by the 
respondent company who admonished them not to repeat the incident, as the same 
is not only prejudicial to them but to the respondent business; that on June 22, 
1953, the respondent company terminated the services of pinboys Morado and 
Castel and warned pinboy Martinez and janitor Cedano, both of whom were retained 
in their services." (pp. 6-8. Annex "C")</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"It would, however, seem from the facts given that the immediate and 
proximate cause of the dismissal on June 22, 1953 of Morado and Castel was the 
altercation on June 18, 1953 as above described. As to whether the said incident 
is a just cause for the dismissal of the above-named individuals is a question 
which should be resolved in the light of the provisions of Republic Act No. 875 
which took effect on June 17, 1953. This, it is believed, is more in keeping 
with the spirit of the Industrial Peace Act and with the protection to labor 
clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p>"From the evidence on record, this Court believes and so holds that there was 
obvious discrimination manifested by the respondent between Morado and Castel, 
on one side, and Martinez and Cedano, on the other. For while the former who 
were admittedly members of the petitioner union were outrightly separated from 
the service, the latter who were non-union members were merely given warning." 
(pp. 10-11, Annex "C")</p></blockquote>
<p>The first ground raised in this appeal is lack of jurisdiction on the part of 
the court below. The petition alleges unfair labor practices; consequently, the 
claim of lack of jurisdiction is absolutely without merit.</p>
<p>As to the other issue, we cannot agree with the court below that the 
dismissal of the two pinboys was an act of discrimination committed by 
respondent against the members of the union. As the court itself found, the 
immediate cause of the altercation between the dismissed pinboys and the other 
two non-member pinboys was the fact that Morada (union member) took a bicycle of 
one Martinez (non-union member) and gave it to Infante for his use, and as 
Martinez and Cedano (non-union members) resented the taking of the bicycle, the 
altercation arose between them. The altercation was evidently, caused by an act 
of misappropriation of the bicycle and its use through the acts of Morada. Not 
because Morada was the chapter president of the union was he justified in 
appropriating, without the consent of the owner, the bicycle belonging to a 
non-union member. His act was an abuse of his position as president of the 
union, and his subsequent act in thereafter claiming that his dismissal was due 
to discrimination, evinces a predisposition to falsify facts. In a bowling 
alley, which is maintained for public recreation, customers often bring vehicles 
for private use which they leave . beside the alley. It is absolutely necessary 
for the success of the business that pinboys employed should respect these 
customers' vehicles or anybody else's property. This norm of conduct should be 
observed not only with respect to customer's property but also to other 
employee's properties whether belonging to the union or not. To permit such a 
conduct to go unpunished would certainly encourage petty thievery among pinboys 
and employees and further abuses. Unions are not organized to abuse non-union 
members or the latter's rights and any act of abuse by any member of a union 
against a non-union member should not be left unpunished.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations we find that the dismissal of the two 
pinboys, members of the union, was fully justified. The judgment appealed should 
be, as it is hereby, reversed, with costs against the respondent United , 
Employees Welfare Association.</p>

<div align="center"><strong><em><br>DISSENTING OPINION</em></strong> </div>
<p><strong>BARRERA, J.: </strong></p>
<p>I dissent.</p>
<p>From the facts found by the Court of Industrial Relations, it is clear to me 
that the principal, if not the only, reason for the dismissal of the pin-boys 
Avelino Morada and Godofredo Castel, was their union activities, they being the 
chapter president and auditor respectively of respondent labor union. Such 
dismissal could not be the result of the unauthorized use of the bicycle, which 
the majority qualified as misappropriation, because Castel did not take part 
therein (it was Morada who took it and Infante, another pin-boy, who used the 
same) and yet he (Castel) was dismissed. Neither could the altercation be the 
cause of the dismissal, because of the four participants, only Morada and Castel 
were dismissed, while Martinez and Cedano, who were non-members, were retained. 
Under the circumstances, I agree with the Court of Industrial Relations that 
there was obvious discrimination against the unionist pin-boys.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
