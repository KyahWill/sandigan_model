				G.R. No. L-8320, December 20, 1955</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE VS. SIM BEN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sim Ben appeals from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Cebu 
finding him guilty of violating paragraph 3, Article 201 of the Revised Penal 
Code, for having exhibited cinematographic' films of indecent or immoral scenes 
inside his establishment, a restaurant which is a place open to public view in 
the City of Cebu, On the sole. ground that he entered a plea of guilty to the 
information without the aid of counsel.
<p>The minutes of the session of the Court 31 January 1953 disclose that when 
the case was called for trial, the appellant was informed by the Court of his 
right to have counsel and asked if he desired the aid of one. He replied that he 
did not. Then the Court asked, if he was agreeable to have the, information read 
to him even without the assistance of counsel. His answer was in the 
affirmative. The court interpreter translated ths information to him in the 
local dialect and after the translation he entered a plea of guilty: He was 
asked whether he knew that because of the plea of guilty the punishment as 
provided for by law would be imposed upon him and he answered "Yes, sir." The 
Court asked him if he insisted' on his pies of guilty and he answered "Yes, 
sir." At this juncture the fiscal recommended that a fine of P200 be imposed 
upon the defendant. Thereupon, the Court sentenced him to suffer 6 months and 1 
day of <em>prision correccional</em> and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>What transpired when the appellant was arraigned shows that his rights 
were,fully protected and safeguarded. The Court complied with its duty when it 
informed the appellant that it was his right to have the aid of counsel. And 
before pronouncing the sentence the Court took pains to ascertain whether he was 
aware of the consequencss of the plea he had entered. Notwithstanding this 
precaution and warning, he waived his right to have the aid of counsel and 
entered a plea of guilty to the information.</p>
<p>Appellant claims that he entered the plea of guilty because the fiscal 
promised him that only a fine would be imposed. The recommendation of the fiscal 
that only a fine be imposed upon the appellant seems to bear out his claim; but 
such recommendation or one of leniency does not mean that the appellant is not 
guilty of the crime charged against him. A promise to recommend a specific 
penalty such as fine does not render the sentence void if the Court ignores the 
recommendation and metes out to the defendant a penalty which is provided by 
law.</p>
<p>The sentence appealed from is affirmed, with cost against the appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Moniemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
