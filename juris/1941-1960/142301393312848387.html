				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts proved in these cases,&nbsp; as correctly narrated by the Solicitor&nbsp; General, may&nbsp; be summarized as follows:<br><br>On June 1.5, 1951, Domingo Curi met his son-in-law Enrique Arejola&nbsp; in Obo,&nbsp; Tinambac, Camarines Sur, and was requested by the latter to meet him on the following night in the house of Manuel Daet in San Vicente, also in Tinambac. Pursuant thereto, Curi went&nbsp; to the appointed place&nbsp; at 7:00 o'clock of the following evening and there he found Manuel Daet and his wife Cenona Toy, Jose Villaroya and Enrique Arejola, who&nbsp; were then discussing&nbsp; the plan&nbsp; to kill the spouses&nbsp; Felix Refugio and Victoria Toy that same evening.&nbsp; According to their plan, Daet was to shoot Felix Refugio, Villaroya was to stab Victoria Toy, while Arejola was to kill the dog; afterwards they&nbsp; were to carry the body of Felix Refugio&nbsp; to the&nbsp; railroad track to&nbsp; be run over&nbsp; by the&nbsp; train in&nbsp; order to remove any suspicion&nbsp; of foul play and that his&nbsp; death may appear&nbsp; accidental.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch&nbsp; as Curi overheard their plan,&nbsp; the&nbsp; group invited him to join them in their unholy mission, and when&nbsp; he demurred, Daet threatened&nbsp; him with&nbsp; bodily harm.&nbsp;&nbsp; So Curi had no&nbsp; other alternative but&nbsp; to&nbsp; go&nbsp; with them.<br><br>On&nbsp; that&nbsp; same&nbsp; evening Enrique Arejola,&nbsp; then armed with a long <i>bolo,</i>&nbsp; Manuel Daet carrying a home-made revolver, and Jose&nbsp; Villaroya&nbsp; who&nbsp; was&nbsp; armed&nbsp; with a .45 caliber revolver and a hunting knife,&nbsp; together with Domingo&nbsp; Curi,&nbsp; left&nbsp; Daet's place and&nbsp; walked towards&nbsp; the house of their intended victim Felix Refugio which was about 120&nbsp; to 150 meters away.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; nearing the place, Curi was told to stand guard from a distance of five meters from Refugio's&nbsp; house, while Daet, Villaroya&nbsp; and Arejola proceeded towards the stairs.&nbsp; At that&nbsp; hour, the main door of Refugio's&nbsp; house was open and the interior lighted with a petromax lamp.&nbsp; Felix Refugio was then upstairs, seated&nbsp; in front of&nbsp; a desk busy&nbsp; writing&nbsp; and giving his back to the&nbsp; three intruders.&nbsp; As the latter were approaching, the dog which&nbsp; was chained to the stairway barked, whereupon&nbsp; Arejola struck it twice with his&nbsp; bolo on&nbsp; the head and body thus&nbsp; killing it.&nbsp; Almost&nbsp; simultaneously, Daet,&nbsp; from&nbsp; the foot of the&nbsp; stairs, fired&nbsp; a shot with his paltik at&nbsp; Felix Eefugio&nbsp; and&nbsp; then fled from the scene. Felix&nbsp; Refugio was hit on the&nbsp; back&nbsp; of his&nbsp; head and he slumped on&nbsp; the&nbsp; floor.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards, Villaroya and Arejola went up the house&nbsp; and&nbsp; meeting Refugio's wife, Victoria Toy, Villaroya&nbsp; stabbed&nbsp; her twice on the chest with&nbsp; his&nbsp; hunting&nbsp; knife.&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp; Arejola took a can&nbsp; of petroleum from a corner&nbsp; of the house and after spraying the floor and&nbsp; walls&nbsp; with it, applied a lighted match thereto burning the house.&nbsp; As the fire spread inside the house, Villaroya and Arejola hurriedly carried down-stairs&nbsp; the limp body of Felix Refugio who was still alive. Arejola then took&nbsp; a pole from the eamarin in&nbsp; front of the house, and used it to carry the body of Felix Sefugio&nbsp; to the&nbsp; railroad tracks about&nbsp; a kilometer away. Domingo Guri accompanied&nbsp; Villaroya&nbsp; and Arejola,&nbsp; acting&nbsp; as their look-out, and upon reaching the railroad tracks, the latter two left the body&nbsp; of Felix Refugio making his head rest on&nbsp; the rails.&nbsp; Felix&nbsp; Refugio&nbsp; was still groaning at the time,&nbsp; and then Villaroja shot him&nbsp; on the back of the head thereby causing his&nbsp; death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immeliately afterwards, Domingo Curi escaped from that place.&nbsp; (Exhibit 2.).<br><br>The charred remains of Victoria Toy were identified by her son-in-law&nbsp; Filoteo&nbsp; Cruz,&nbsp; from&nbsp; her&nbsp; ring&nbsp; and the&nbsp; 3 keys which she&nbsp; used to&nbsp; carry.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; the cadaver of&nbsp; Felix Kefugio was discovered&nbsp; by Angel&nbsp; Tobale along-side the railroad tracks covered 'by talakib and grass,&nbsp; and&nbsp; not far away, the bloodstained bamboo pole.<br><br>The post-mortem examination conducted by&nbsp; Dr. Pablo T, Platon on the remains of&nbsp; Victoria&nbsp; Toy-Kefugio show the following findings:<br><blockquote>1. Carbonization&nbsp; of the whole&nbsp; body.<br><br>2. Brain&nbsp; substance carbonized.<br><br>3. Bladder; uterus;&nbsp; and&nbsp; small&nbsp; intestines&nbsp; partly carbonized.<br><br>Cause&nbsp; of death:&nbsp; Universal burn with&nbsp; secondary shock.&nbsp; (Exhibit C,&nbsp; p. 21, Record&nbsp; of case G. R.&nbsp; No. L-5781)<br></blockquote>On the&nbsp; cadaver of&nbsp; Felix&nbsp; Refugio,&nbsp; the following&nbsp; are the findings of Dr.&nbsp; Platon:<br><blockquote>1. Bullet wound&nbsp; penetrating skull&nbsp; at the&nbsp; region&nbsp; of the left occipital region.&nbsp; Wound was probed&nbsp; to a&nbsp; depth of 6 1/2 inches; course parallel&nbsp; to the base&nbsp; of the skull.&nbsp; Slug recovered.<br><br>2. Fractured skull—left&nbsp; parietal.<br><br>3. Fractured skull—right occipital.<br><br>4. Bullet wound; penetrating; just above the right scapula (inner border)&nbsp; with exit at the right side of the neck about&nbsp; 1 1/2 inches above the&nbsp; distal end of the clavicle&nbsp; (right) with the&nbsp; course&nbsp; of the bullet travelling upward and slightly inwards.<br><br>Cause of death—wound,&nbsp; bullet, at the left occipital region;&nbsp; with secondary shock; Homicidal.&nbsp; (Exhibit A, p.&nbsp; 19, Esc. of case G.&nbsp; R. No. L-5782.<br></blockquote>Because of&nbsp; these and other facts that appeared at the investigation held by the local authorities, Jose Villaroya, Manuel Daet,&nbsp; Enrique&nbsp; Arejola,&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Morales,&nbsp; Alfredo Ibasco, Jr., Ernesto Tacorda and Loreto Selpo were charged in two separate informations filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Camarines&nbsp; Sur.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; first case&nbsp; said&nbsp; defendants were accused of the crime&nbsp; of murder of&nbsp; Victoria&nbsp; Toy de&nbsp; Kefugio with arson&nbsp; (see CFI No. 2295— G. R. No. L-5781) and in the second of the murder of Felix Refugio&nbsp; (see CFI No.&nbsp; 2296—G. R. No.&nbsp; L-5782).<br><br>The&nbsp; two&nbsp; cases&nbsp; were tried&nbsp; simultaneously and at the conclusion&nbsp; of which&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial judge&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; a&nbsp; single decision&nbsp; finding&nbsp; Jose Villaroya,&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Daet&nbsp; and&nbsp; Enrique Arejola,&nbsp; guilty of&nbsp; complex crime of&nbsp; murder with arson and sentenced each of them to the penalty&nbsp; of death and to indemnify&nbsp; the heirs of Victoria Toy in&nbsp; the sum of P6,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same defendants were also convicted of the crime of murder&nbsp; of Felix Refugio, and&nbsp; each&nbsp; of them again were sentenced to death and to&nbsp; indemnify the heiry of Felix Kefugio&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P6,000.&nbsp; The other accused :&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose Morales, Loreto&nbsp; Selpo, Ernesto Tacorda and Alfredo Ibasco, Jr., were&nbsp; acquitted&nbsp; in both cases.<br><br>From this decision Jose Villaroya, Manuel Daet and&nbsp; Enrique&nbsp; Arejola&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to us&nbsp; and in&nbsp; this instance their counsel makes several assignments&nbsp; of error,&nbsp; ail of them dealing' on the weight of the&nbsp; evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.<br><br>The narration of the facts proved made at the beginning of this&nbsp; decision clearly shows appellants'&nbsp; guilt of two crimes&nbsp; of murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the crimes are so serious&nbsp; and&nbsp; the penalty imposed by the lower&nbsp; Court is the capital punishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will proceed&nbsp; to&nbsp; consider said facts in the light of appellants'&nbsp; defenses interposed.<br><br>There is no dispute to the&nbsp; fact that the&nbsp; spouses Felix Refugio and Victoria Toy met violent deaths on the night of June 16,&nbsp; 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; The principal controverted question in this appeal refers to the&nbsp; identity of&nbsp; the&nbsp; assailants,&nbsp; the prosecution maintaining&nbsp; that appellants were the killers, while the latter disclaim any&nbsp; participation in the crimes by putting-up a defense of alibi.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only eyewitness to the horrible event was Domingo Curi who positively identified appellants, one&nbsp; of whom, Enrique&nbsp; Arejola, is&nbsp; his own son-in-law,&nbsp; as the perpetrators&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; With&nbsp; regard to this point,&nbsp; appellants assail the credibility of said witness&nbsp; because of alleged contradictions&nbsp; and by claiming that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; an old man of 51 years&nbsp; of age&nbsp; and&nbsp; illiterate, his&nbsp; memory&nbsp; being faulty and&nbsp; confused&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; make&nbsp; his testimony "absolutely&nbsp; unreliable".&nbsp; For&nbsp; a man&nbsp; living in the country the age of 51 years does&nbsp; not turn&nbsp; a man very old&nbsp; as&nbsp; to affect&nbsp; his&nbsp; memory&nbsp; to&nbsp; make it&nbsp; faulty.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the second place&nbsp; the&nbsp; Solicitor General states:<br><blockquote>"The rule is well established that&nbsp; contradictions&nbsp; in&nbsp; one's&nbsp; testimony do not necessarily&nbsp; render&nbsp; the&nbsp; entire testimony&nbsp; incredible, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; we&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; to discredit&nbsp; "witness&nbsp; whenever ingenuity can&nbsp; develop the&nbsp; slightest inconsistency&nbsp; (People<i>&nbsp; vs. </i> Buada,&nbsp; 60 Phil. 863; People <i>vs.</i> Cu Unjieng, 61 Phil. 908;&nbsp; Wharton's Criminal Evidence, 11th ed.s&nbsp; 2332).&nbsp; In&nbsp; the instant&nbsp; case, the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; contradictions pointed out by&nbsp; appellants,&nbsp; such as: that while in his direct&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; Curi declared that the dog was <i>barking</i>&nbsp; when&nbsp; it was slain, on cross-examination he stated that the dog was <i>sleeping;</i> that while&nbsp; at&nbsp; first&nbsp; he&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that&nbsp; appellant Daet&nbsp; shot Felix Refugio<i> after </i>Arejola killed the dog, later he stated that the shooting of&nbsp; Refugio&nbsp; took place simultaneously with the killing of the dog; and that&nbsp; while in his direct testimony he&nbsp; stated that immediately after&nbsp; the&nbsp; shooting,&nbsp; Daet&nbsp; went&nbsp; home thereby&nbsp; implying&nbsp; that he merely walked&nbsp; home, on cross-examination he stated that Daet&nbsp; ran away,&nbsp; are more&nbsp; apparent than real, and&nbsp; if at&nbsp; all,&nbsp; refer&nbsp; to&nbsp; unimportant&nbsp; details which do not destroy the&nbsp; effectiveness&nbsp; of&nbsp; the testimony as a whole.&nbsp; 'Deficiencies of translation and&nbsp; transcription and the lack of thoroughness&nbsp; in the examination of the witness have to he taken into account."&nbsp;&nbsp; (People <i>vs.</i> Mangcol, et al., G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-2B44,&nbsp; June&nbsp; 30, 1950).&nbsp; Then again, truthful&nbsp;&nbsp; eyewitnesses&nbsp; do not&nbsp; always&nbsp; make perfect&nbsp; witnesses.&nbsp; We&nbsp; must&nbsp; not lose sight of the fact that a witness has his own&nbsp; way&nbsp; of&nbsp; stating the facts&nbsp; as they are known&nbsp; to him and had come to his perception.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; his&nbsp; degree of education,&nbsp;&nbsp; mental&nbsp; condition,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the solemnity of&nbsp; the court proceedings&nbsp; often account for many defective answers.&nbsp; But judges&nbsp; are&nbsp; trained to make allowances&nbsp; for all&nbsp; these, and&nbsp; consequently pay more&nbsp; attention to&nbsp; the sincerity of the witness&nbsp; and&nbsp; his willingness&nbsp; to&nbsp; tell&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; story.&nbsp; Likewise!, .it has&nbsp; already "been&nbsp; held that the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; an ignorant person is still&nbsp; worthy of&nbsp; credence&nbsp; (People <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Dionlsio Villamin, G- R. No. 45301;&nbsp; U. S. m&nbsp; Burns,&nbsp; 41 Phil. 418), and indeed, simple country folk like&nbsp; Domingo Curi could&nbsp; not&nbsp; have&nbsp; fabricated, much less so clearly&nbsp; described in detail&nbsp; the&nbsp; events that&nbsp; transpired&nbsp; that fateful evening unless he had really witnessed it.<br><br>One significant&nbsp; circumstance which should not escape our notice is that no competent evidence has been introduced by the defense to show why&nbsp; Domingo&nbsp; Curi the principal&nbsp; witness&nbsp; for the prosecution should&nbsp; testify falsely against the&nbsp; appellants, one&nbsp; of whom is his own&nbsp; son-in-law.&nbsp;&nbsp; The testimony of Domingo Curi&nbsp; has&nbsp; been corroborated&nbsp; by the evidence subsequently unearthed,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as the wounds on the dog&nbsp; and the bullet wound on&nbsp; Felix Refugio found above the&nbsp; right scapula&nbsp; with exit&nbsp; at the right side&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; neck ('also the bullet wound&nbsp; penetrating-&nbsp; skull&nbsp; at the left&nbsp; occipital region).&nbsp; According&nbsp; to Dr. Platon, who conducted the&nbsp; autopsy, the bullet travelled upward&nbsp; at&nbsp; the angle of 30&nbsp; degrees.&nbsp; According to Curi. Felix Refugio was sitting1 before a table with&nbsp; his&nbsp; back towards the door when Daet who was on the ground shot him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Curi&nbsp; is corroborated&nbsp; by Honesto Gacer, who&nbsp; declared that at about&nbsp; 7: BO in&nbsp; the evening of June&nbsp; 16, 1951, while&nbsp; on his&nbsp; way home from&nbsp; the&nbsp; store&nbsp; of&nbsp; Filoteo Cruz in&nbsp; San Vicente,&nbsp; Tinambae, he met&nbsp; appellants Villaroya and Daet in&nbsp; company with&nbsp; Domingo Curi&nbsp; going towards the house&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; late Felix Refugio&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 85-86, t.s.n., Vol. Ill).&nbsp; Appellants now question&nbsp; the credibility&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said Honesto&nbsp; Gacer&nbsp; claiming that if it was true&nbsp; that&nbsp; he met the appellants&nbsp; and&nbsp; Curi on the&nbsp; night in question, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; strange that he did not greet them&nbsp; nor was he seen by&nbsp; them on&nbsp; that occasion.&nbsp; We&nbsp; believe&nbsp; the claim is without any&nbsp; merit."</blockquote>As to the reason&nbsp; why&nbsp; Domingo Curi&nbsp; was&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; testify&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case and even implicate&nbsp; Enrique&nbsp; Arejola, his son-in-law,&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; Judge has&nbsp; the following to say:<br><blockquote>"Domingo Curi&nbsp; must&nbsp; either have&nbsp; been, motivated&nbsp; by a&nbsp; desire to tell the truth, or by a consuming hatred to induce&nbsp; him to state a falsehood.&nbsp; The possible&nbsp; motive given by the defense why&nbsp; Domingo Cwri testified for the prosecution was because Enrique&nbsp; Arejola had not followed the wishes&nbsp; of his fathcr-In-law to&nbsp; stay in his&nbsp; land, but instead,&nbsp; had left&nbsp; the house of Domingo&nbsp; Curi&nbsp; with his wife and went to live in Bani; and that later Domingo Curi took&nbsp; his&nbsp; daughter Cresencia from the house of&nbsp; Enrique Arejola and brought&nbsp; her&nbsp; back to his house.&nbsp; According to Enrique&nbsp; Arejola,&nbsp; when he,&nbsp; tried to get his wife back, he was not even able&nbsp; to talk with his father-in-law, because he was chased&nbsp; with a <i>bolo</i>."</blockquote>Even assuming that this was true, the trial&nbsp; Judge did not&nbsp; believe&nbsp; that this reason is&nbsp; sufficient to impel Domingo Curi&nbsp; to testify&nbsp; falsely against&nbsp; all of&nbsp; the appellants&nbsp; and to subject them, including his son-in-law, to the highest penalty that can be imposed under the law.&nbsp; We, certainly, agree with His&nbsp; Honor.<br><br>It is already&nbsp; settled and&nbsp; enunciated in a long line of decisions&nbsp; of this Court, that the trial Judge that saw the witnesses testify&nbsp; and&nbsp; had&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to&nbsp; observe their demeanor and manner of&nbsp; testifying,&nbsp; is&nbsp; in a most preeminent position to&nbsp; gauge&nbsp; their&nbsp; credibility&nbsp; and,&nbsp; consequently, that&nbsp; his findings of fact&nbsp; must not be disturbed, unless the record shall show that some facts&nbsp; or circumstances of weight&nbsp; or&nbsp; influence have been overlooked,&nbsp; or the significance&nbsp; of&nbsp; which has&nbsp; been misinterpreted by the lower Court, or&nbsp; some conclusion established from the facts is inconsistent with those findings,&nbsp; or there is some inherent&nbsp; weakness in&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; upon&nbsp; which the&nbsp; trial judge based his conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Baltazar<i> vs.</i> Alberto, 33 PhiL 336; People&nbsp; <i>vs. </i>Severino Labartene, G. R. No.&nbsp; 6360-R., promulgated October 2,&nbsp; 1951.&nbsp; See&nbsp; also&nbsp; People <i> vs. </i> Rorbano,&nbsp; 78&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 702,&nbsp; citing&nbsp; People <i>vs </i>De Asis,&nbsp; 61 Phil. 384; People <i> vs.</i> Garcia,&nbsp; 63&nbsp; Phil. 296;&nbsp; People <i>vs.</i> Masin, 64 Phil. 757;&nbsp; People <i> vs. </i> Macalindong,&nbsp; 76 Phil. 719; Hermenegildo Lao <i>vs.</i> Director of Lands, 76&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 719, citing Baltazar&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Alberto,&nbsp; 33 Phil.&nbsp; 358; Licad&nbsp; and Vitug <i>vs.</i> Bacani, 51 Phil. 53; U.S.<i> vs.</i> Ambrosio, 17 Phil. 295; U.S <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Molad, 27 Phil. 488;&nbsp; Melliza <i>vs.</i> Towle, 33 Phil.&nbsp; 345; U.S. <i>vs. </i>Remigio, 37&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 599;&nbsp; People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Cabrera, 43 Phil.&nbsp; 64; Corasay <i> vs. </i> Arquiza, 53&nbsp; Phil. 72;&nbsp; Garcia <i>vs.</i> Garcia, 63 Phil. 419).<br><br>&nbsp;The&nbsp; other&nbsp; defense&nbsp; raised&nbsp; by appellants is one of <i>alibi.</i> This Court&nbsp; has&nbsp; already held in numerous&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; that the defense of alibi&nbsp; is the&nbsp; weakest defense" that an accused can avail&nbsp; of,&nbsp; and cannot prosper where the accused has been positively and properly identified by the offended party.&nbsp;&nbsp; An<i> alibi</i> should be proved&nbsp; by probable&nbsp; evidence which&nbsp; reasonably satisfied the Court of the truth of said defense.&nbsp; U. S. <i> vs.</i>&nbsp; Oxiles, 29&nbsp; Phil. 587.&nbsp; Oral proof&nbsp; of <i> alibi</i> must&nbsp; be clearly&nbsp; and&nbsp; satisfactorily established&nbsp; because it is easily manufactured and usually so unreliable that&nbsp; it&nbsp; can&nbsp; rarely be given&nbsp; credit&nbsp; (People<i> vs.</i>&nbsp; Badilla, 48&nbsp; Phil. 710).<br><br>As pointed&nbsp; out by the Solicitor&nbsp; general, "an&nbsp; alibi to be&nbsp; effective&nbsp; must be proved by positive, clear&nbsp; and satisfactory&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; which&nbsp; reasonably&nbsp; satisfy&nbsp; the court of its&nbsp; truth (People<i> vs. </i>Dizon, 76 Phil.,&nbsp; 265,&nbsp; 42&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 2766), and&nbsp; it&nbsp; has been held that&nbsp; an alibi&nbsp; is weak when it is&nbsp; only supported by&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; found&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; related by ties&nbsp; of relationship&nbsp; or friendship to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants as in the instant case (People <i>vs.</i> Japitana et al., 77 Phil., 175). and that even if&nbsp; the proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; alibi ia&nbsp; supported by&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony of witnesses, yet such&nbsp; proof&nbsp; cannot prevail&nbsp; when the&nbsp; identity of the appellants as the person who committed the offense&nbsp; has been established&nbsp; by eye witnesses and<font color="#FF0000">*</font> L-1713)."<br><br>As to&nbsp; appellants'&nbsp; motive&nbsp; for killing the spouses Felix Refugio and Victoria Toy,&nbsp; it is not difficult to find that bad blood had&nbsp; existed between appellants and their victim Felix Refugio.<br>Daet, and Villaroya on one hand and Felix Eefugio on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other, had&nbsp; filed mutual accusations&nbsp; and appellant Villaroya even made attempts upon&nbsp; the life of Felix Refugio even&nbsp; as early&nbsp; as&nbsp; 1948.&nbsp; The&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of Arejola&nbsp; also&nbsp; supplies the motive for Arejola's&nbsp; willingness to join&nbsp; appellants in&nbsp; a common cause to inflict&nbsp; harm upon the person&nbsp; whom they&nbsp; believed&nbsp; to have&nbsp; caused them damaged.<br><br>In&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; case No. 2295 (L-5781), appellants were prosecuted and found guilty of the complex&nbsp; crime of murder&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Victoria&nbsp; Toy de Refugio&nbsp; with arson.&nbsp;&nbsp; To this the Solicitor General does&nbsp; not agree,&nbsp; for&nbsp; he&nbsp; holds&nbsp; that the crime committed in that case is murder qualified&nbsp; by evident premeditation.&nbsp; According to the post-mortem examination conducted&nbsp; by Dr. Pablo T. Platon&nbsp; on&nbsp; the remains of Victoria Toy de&nbsp; Refugio,&nbsp; the cause of death is said to be "universal burn with secondary shock" (Exhibit&nbsp; C,&nbsp; p. 21,&nbsp; rec. of case No.&nbsp; L-5781).&nbsp; Nothing is said that the stab wounds inflicted upon her by appellant Jose Villaroya was the cause of her death.<br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code prescribes the following:<br><blockquote>Art. 248. <i>Murder.</i>—Any person who, not falling within tire provisions of article 246, shall kill another,&nbsp; shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to death,&nbsp; if&nbsp; committed&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; any&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; following&nbsp; attendant circumstances:<br><br>1. With <i> treachery,</i>&nbsp; taking advantage of&nbsp; superior&nbsp; strength, "with .the aid of&nbsp; armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense; or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity;<br><br>2. * * *<br><br>3. By&nbsp; means of&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *,<i> fire</i> (incendio&nbsp; says the Spanish text of the Code)&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *, or with&nbsp; the use of any&nbsp; other means involving great waste and ruin;<br><br>4. * * *<br><br>5. With <i>evident premeditation;</i><br><br>6.&nbsp; With <i>cruelty,</i> by deliberately and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging&nbsp; or&nbsp; scoffing&nbsp; at his person or corpse.<br></blockquote>Arson as a means of killing&nbsp; a&nbsp; person&nbsp; is&nbsp; a qualifying circumstance&nbsp; of&nbsp; murder and in the case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar&nbsp; can&nbsp; not be taken into account to form the complex crime of murder with arson&nbsp; (see Article 62, Nos. 1 and 2, RPC).<br><br>In connection&nbsp; with the death of&nbsp; Victoria Toy&nbsp; the following aggravating- circumstances attended the commission of the offense, to wit, that the crime was perpetrated&nbsp; with treachery, evident premeditation, cruelty, by means of arson and in&nbsp; the dwelling" of&nbsp; the offended party.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; of night time and use&nbsp; of&nbsp; superior&nbsp; strength, the&nbsp; three defendants being&nbsp; armed, are usually&nbsp; included in the circumstance of treachery. One of the&nbsp; first four . circumstances can&nbsp; be used as qualifying and the rest as aggravating circumstances and there&nbsp; being no mitigating circumstances to offset&nbsp; the&nbsp; same, the penalty to be imposed upon each of appellants is death.&nbsp; (Article 64, No. 3, UPC.)<br><br>As regards Criminal Case No. 2296 (G. E. No. L-5782) appellants are found guilty of&nbsp; murder attended&nbsp; by the aggravating circumstances of treachery, evident&nbsp; premeditation and dwelling of the victim.&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstance of evident&nbsp; premeditation may serve as qualifying circumstance while&nbsp; the other two as ordinary aggravating circumstance, and&nbsp; there being no&nbsp; mitigating&nbsp; circumstance to offset the same the three appellants&nbsp; are also sentenced to the&nbsp; capital punishment.&nbsp; (Article 64,&nbsp; No. 3, RPC.)<br><br>In&nbsp; view of&nbsp; the foregoing, the decision appealed&nbsp; from are&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed&nbsp; except in&nbsp; so far&nbsp; as the&nbsp; nature of the&nbsp; crime in&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; No. L-5781 which is&nbsp; murder,&nbsp; with costs against&nbsp; appellants.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; sentence, the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; Articles 81,&nbsp; 82&nbsp; and 84 of the Revised Penal Code shall be strictly applied.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
