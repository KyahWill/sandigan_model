				<H3>FERNANDO GUEVARRA AND MARCOS GUEVARRA, PETITIONERS, VS. VICENTE DEL ROSARIO, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF TAYABAS, HERMOGENES CALUAG, PASTOR C. JAVIER,. CARLOS A. BUENDIA, AND SEBASTIAN A. LIWAG, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>Fernando Guevarra and Marcos Guevarra pray for a writ of mandamus to compel 
the respondent court to conduct a preliminary investigation upon a complaint 
filed by them on June 28, 1944, charging Hermogenes Caluag, Provincial Fiscal of 
Tayabas, Pastor C. Javier, Municipal Mayor of Candelaria, Tayabas; Carlos A. 
Buendia, Justice of the Peace of Sariaya and Candelaria, Tayabas, and Sebastian 
A. Li wag, Clerk of Court of the Justice of the Peace of Candelaria, Tayabas, 
with the crime of falsification of public documents, denned and punished under 
article 171 of the Revised Penal Code. They also pray that the respondent court 
be compelled to communicate on the subject matter of the complaint with the 
Secretary of Justice . so that the latter may appoint an acting fiscal in view 
of the incumbent's disqualification to act in the case.</p>
<p>Two days after the filing of the complaint referred to, the respondent court 
acting thereon ordered the return of the complaint to the petitioners, for the 
reason that the Ministry of Justice or the Bureau of Public Prosecution of the 
Republic of the Philippines should first be heard before the complaint might be 
entertained. A motion for reconsideration of the order was denied on July 14, 
1944.</p>
<p>The Director of Prisons reports in CA-G. R. No. 77 that the petitioners died 
in Bilibid Prisons. Emilio Guevarra and Ciriaco Guevarra, son and brother of the 
petitioners, pray to be allowed to substitute the petitioners in this case.</p>
<p>The substitution prayed for calls for determination of the question whether, 
upon the death of the petitioners, the action brought in this proceeding 
survived to their heirs or legal representatives. The action survived if the 
cause of action survived. The cause of action, upon which this proceeding in 
mandamus is predicated, arose from the failure of the respondent court to 
conduct a preliminary investigation upon a complaint filed by the petitioners 
charging certain officers with the crime of falsification of public documents. 
The right of the petitioners to file a complaint charging the commission of a 
crime is personal. It is so, because as required in section 2, Rule 106, a 
con&gt; plaint charging a person with an offense must be subscribed by the 
offended party. The right being personal, the complaint filed by the petitioners 
with the respondent court abated upon their death.</p>
<p>Likewise, the cause of action, upon which this proceeding in mandamus is 
based, is personal. The failure of the respondent court to conduct a preliminary 
investigation which gave rise to this proceeding was upon petitioners' 
complaint. The heirs or legal representatives of the late petitioners could not 
justly complain of the failure of the respondent court to conduct a preliminary 
investigation, because they had filed no complaint. It was the complaint of the 
deceased petitioners. The cause of action in this proceeding did not survive to 
the heirs or legal representatives of the late petitioners, because the 
complaint filed by the petitioners with the respondent court, from which the 
cause of action in this proceeding arose, abated upon the death of said 
petitioners. Hence this proceeding cannot be prosecuted or continued by the 
heirs or legal representatives of the late petitioners, for the cause of action 
upon which it is predicated is personal and did not survive to said heirs and 
legal representatives.</p>
<p>Motion for substitution is denied and petition for a writ of mandamus abated, 
without costs.</p><em>Hilado, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and<em> Tuason, JJ.,</em> 
concur. <br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>FERIA, J.,</strong> with whom concur <strong>MORAN, C. J.</strong>, 
and <strong>PABLO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the majority decision for the following reasons:</p>
<p>It is true and plain that the abatement of actions, either 1 by operation of 
the law or the will of the parties, does not carry with it the extinction of the 
right of action; but it is also true that the extinction of a cause or right of 
action necessarily and impliedly carries with it the abatement of the pending 
action to enforce it, because the latter is but the legal means of enforcing the 
former.</p>
<p>The common law rule that the death of a party abates a pending action 
irrespective of whether or not the cause of action survives, has never been in 
force or applied in this jurisdiction. Section 119 of the old Code of Civil 
Procedure Act No. 190, from which section 17, Rule 3, of the Rules of Court was 
taken, provided that "In case a party to an action dies while the action is 
pending, the action shall not abate by reason thereof, but the court on motion 
may allow the action or proceeding to be continued by or against his executor, 
administrator or other legal representative, etc."</p>
<p>Where the cause of action is entirely personal to the plaintiff and does not 
survive to his representatives, such as the right to support, divorce, and so 
forth, the action abates on the death of the plaintiff. But if the right of 
action is not personal and survives to the representatives of the deceased, the 
action is not abated or extinguished by the death of the plaintiff, and the 
latter will be substituted by his legal representative under section 17, Rule 3 
of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>According to our Rules of Court, mandamus is a special civil action, and 
therefore the provisions of section 17, Rule 3, on substitution of parties who 
die during the pendency of a suit apply. Rules 1 to 3 of the Rules of Court 
contain general provisions applicable to all civil actions, ordinary and 
special, as contradistinguished from a special proceeding; and section 1, Rule 
65 of the same Rules further prescribes that "the provisions of the preceding 
rules (including said Rule 3) shall apply in actions * * * for mandamus, etc." 
This is in accordance with the rule prevailing in United States, where "it is 
now considered in most jurisdictions, and especially in those where both legal 
and equitable remedies are administered by the same tribunal or where the code 
system of procedure obtains, that a mandamus proceeding: is not a special 
proceeding, but that it is nothing more nor less than an action at law, or a 
civil action under the code." (18 U. C. L., 333.)</p>
<p>The doctrine enunciated in 18 It. C. L., 335, section 287, as laid down in 
the case of People vs. Western Life Indemnity Co. et al. (2G1 111., 513), to the 
effect that "A proceeding in mandamus is in the nature of personal action, and 
it generally abates on the death of the person in whose behalf they have .been 
instituted, is not borne out by the decision in that case. It is true that the 
Supreme Court of Illinois held in said, case that mandamus is a personal action, 
and the language used was broad enough to warrant the conclusion that the court 
takes the position that all mandamus proceedings abate on the death of the 
petitioner; but the subject matter of the action in said case was such that the 
personal representative who sought to be substituted as petitioner had no 
interest in its continued prosecution. Said conclusion can not, therefore, be 
considered as a general rule, but applicable only to cases involving the same or 
similar facts. In the same decision, it is said that 'This Court has stated that 
where a right of action is so entirely personal that a person, by contract, can 
not place it beyond his control, the action will not survive; that, as a general 
rule, assignability and survivality of causes of action are convertible terms. 
(Selden vs. Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, 239, 111., 67, 87, N. E., 860.) * * 
* It appears from the record that the wife is the beneficiary under this 
insurance policy. It is conceded that she is the only one that could recover 
under it and that the representative of the deceased, after his death, would not 
have any interest in said policy, hence the action could not survive to the 
"heir, devisee, executor or administrator" under section 10 of the Abatement 
Act.'"</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we are of the opinion and so hold that the rule is, 
not that a mandamus proceeding as a personal action abates upon the death of the 
relator in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, but that it may 
abate or not depending upon the nature of the right sought to be enforced 
thereby. In other words, the nature of the right of action sought to be enforced 
by mandamus is a material factor in determining whether or not it abates upon 
the death of the petitioner. If the right of action involved is entirely 
personal and, consequently, does not survive upon the death of the party to his 
representative, the action of mandamus to enforce it abates upon the death of 
the relator. But if the right sought to be enforced is not personal as, for 
instance, an action of mandamus to compel a judge to act in an action for 
recovery of a real or personal property, or a register of deed to inscribe a 
real estate in the relator's name, the mandamus proceeding does not abate upon 
the latter's death.</p>
<p>The question to be determined by this Court in the present case is, 
therefore, whether or not the right of the petitioners, as offended party, to 
subscribe and file a complaint of falsification of public documents against 
certain public officers, and compel by mandamus the respondent judge or his 
successor in the office to practice the corresponding preliminary investigation, 
is entirely personal and does not survive upon the death of the said petitioners 
to their representative. If it is not personal and survives or is not 
extinguished by the death of the petitioners, the now pending mandamus 
proceeding is not abated, and may be continued by their representative in 
substitution for the deceased. But if it is entirely personal to the 
petitioners, or the latter could not, by contract or otherwise, place it beyond 
their control, it is extinguished by the death of the relators, and the latters' 
action of mandamus abates and can not be continued by their legal representative 
under section 17, Rule 3, above mentioned.</p>
<p>Under the Rules of Court relating to criminal procedure, all criminal actions 
shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the fiscal, because the 
people represented by the government is the party in interest to prosecute 
offenses or crimes and secure the conviction of the offenders in order to 
preserve the public order. But where a crime or offense not only disturbs the 
public order but also injures the property right of an individual, the latter, 
as offended party, is authorized by law to subscribe and file a complaint and 
prosecute the criminal action, although subject to the direction and control of 
the fiscal. (Sec. 4, Rule 106, Rules of Court.) The Rules of Court do not 
directly define the meaning of "offended party," but from the provision of 
section 11, Rule 106, of the said Rules, it may clearly be inferred that 
offended party is the person against whom or against whose property the crime 
was committed.</p>
<p>Under the American system, the prosecution of public offenses is reserved to 
the representative of the government and the individual citizen can not bring an 
action for that purpose, for he is protected by his right to bring a civil 
action for damages caused by the crime. The old General Orders No. 58, from 
which the Rules of Court on criminal procedure were taken, has compromised only 
with the private penal action of the injured party, but with that of the latter 
alone,—not with the action which under the . former law on the subject of 
criminal procedure might be brought by any citizen who might desire to aid the 
action of the Government. (United States vs. Municipal Council of Santa Cruz de 
Malabon, 1 Phil., 731, 733.) But, while one of the reasons in maintaining the 
private penal action of the injured party himself, was the right of the latter 
to the civil obligation of the defendant resulting from a crime or misdemeanor, 
the right granted by law to the injured party to subscribe and file a complaint 
against the offender, is not made to depend upon his right of action to recover 
from the offender the latter's civil liability arising out of the crime or 
offense in each particular case. Because, although no civil action may arise out 
of an offense, the injured party may subscribe and file a complaint, as in 
bigamy and other offenses in which the injury or damage caused to the victim can 
not be compensated in terms of money. And even though a public offense causes 
damage or injury to and recoverable by the aggrieved party, and the latter 
waives or reserves the right to institute separately the civil action under 
section 1 of Rule 107, the injured party is entitled or preserves his right to 
subscribe and file a compln'mz against the accused, because of his being the 
offended party.</p>This right conferred by law upon the offended party is purely 
or entirely statutory and personal, and upon his death it does not survive to 
his representative. The heirs of the deceased can not exercise the same right or 
continue the proceeding instituted by the decedent, although they may, as any 
other person, inform the prosecuting attorney of the commission of the crime or 
offense, because they are not and can not be considered the offended party. As 
above stated, the right granted by the Spanish Code of Criminal Procedure to any 
citizen who might desire to aid the action of the Government, to bring a penal 
action, was abolished by the rules of criminal procedure contained in General 
Order No. 58 and its amendments. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J., </strong>with whom concurs <strong>PARAS, 
J.:</strong></p>
<p>On June 28, 1944, petitioners commenced a criminal action by filing directly 
with the Court of First Instance of Tayabas a complaint charging several 
officials with the offense of falsification of public documents which was 
docketed as criminal case No. 158 of said court.</p>
<p>Petitioners allege that Judge Vicente del Rosario of the Court of First 
Instance of Tayabas issued on June 30, 1944, an order commanding the clerk of 
said court to return the complaint to petitioners with instructions either to 
file the case with the Ministry of Justice or the Bureau of Public Prosecution 
which should first be heard before the suit is entertained by the court or to 
file said criminal complaint with the justice of the peace court. On July 3, 
1944, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the 
respondent judge on July 14, 1944, ruling that only an information signed by the 
fiscal and not a complaint signed by the offended party may be filed with the 
Court of First Instance directly.</p>
<p>Alleging that the lower court has violated the provisions of section 4 of 
Rule 108, section 4 of Rule 106, and section 1 of Rule 124, petitioners pray 
that judgment be rendered commanding the lower court to conduct a preliminary 
investigation in said criminal case No. 15S.</p>
<p>The rule provisions invoked by petitioners are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Upon complaint or information filed directly with the Court of First 
Instance, the judge thereof shall conduct a preliminary investigation in the 
manner provided in the following sections, and should he find a reasonable 
ground to believe that the defendant has committed the offense charged, he shall 
issue a warrant for his arrest and try the case on the merits." (Sec. 4, Rule 
106.)</p>
<p>"All criminal actions either commenced by complaint or by information shall 
be prosecuted -under the direction and control of the fiscal." (Sec. 4, Rule 
IOC.)</p>
<p>"Courts of justice shall be always open, except on legal holidays, for the 
filing cf any pleading or other proper papers, for the trial of cases, and for 
the issuance of orders or rendition of .iudrrments. Justice shall be impartially 
administered without unnecessary delay." (Sec. 1, Rule 124.)</p>
<p>On August 23, 1944, Solicitor General Sixto de la Ccsta and Solicitor Vicente 
Arguclles filed the following answer to the petition:</p>
<p>"Comes now the undersigned counsel for the respondent Judge of the Court of 
First Instance of Tayabas, and respectfully states:</p>
<p>"That under the Rules of Court a criminal complaint may be filed directly 
with the Court of First Instance by the offended party and that upon the 
complaint filed, it is the mandatory duty of the Judge thereof to conduct a 
preliminary investigation in the manner provided by said rules. (Rule 108, 
section 4 of Rules of Court.)</p>
<p>"That it is a uniform practice that when a complaint is laid before a 
magistrate be he a judge of the Court of First Instance or a Justice of the 
Peace, 'he must make a preliminary investigation, and if he is satisfied that 
the crime complained of has been committed and that there is reasonable ground 
to believe that the party charged has committed it, he must take the action the 
law requires' (United States vs. Banzuela and Banzuela, 31 Phil., 564; People 
vs. Solon, 47 Phil., 443, 453).</p>
<p>"That it is error on the part of the respondent Judge to order the return of 
the complaint filed in the case in question to the aggrieved party for reasons 
stated in the pronouncements made in the orders of the court of June li), 1944 
and July 14, 1944; and that said complaint could have been entertained in court 
without prejudice to endorsing the matter to the Bureau of Public Prosecution 
for such action as said office may deem proper.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, it is submitted that the orders of the Court of First Instance of 
June 30, 1944, and July 14, 1944, subject of1 the present proceedings are not in 
accord with law, and that the petitioners arc entitled to the remedy sought in 
these proceedings."</p></blockquote>
<p>Emilio Guevarra and Ciriaco Guevarra, sons of petitioner Fernando Guevarra 
and brothers of Marcos Guevarra, being co-accused in the criminal case for 
murder wherein the alleged falsification of public documents has been committed, 
filed in this Court a motion to prosecute this case in. substitution of 
petitioners Fernando and Marcos Guevarra who, according to the Director of 
Prisons, died while detained in the Bilibid Prison, in Muntinlupa.</p>
<p>The majority voted to deny the motion for substitution and to dismiss the 
petition, the latter notwithstanding the fact that the Solicitor General 
himself, more than two years ago, had filed an answer agreeing with the petition 
because "the petitioners are entitled to the remedy sought in these 
proceedings."</p>
<p>The majority contend that the right of petitioners to file a complaint 
charging the commission of a crime is personal and abated upon their death; and 
that the cause of action, upon which this proceeding for mandamus is based, is 
also personal and, for that reason, did not survive to the heirs or legal 
representatives of said petitioners, because upon their death the complaint 
filed by them with the respondent court abated.</p>
<p>The whole architectural structure of the majority's theory is built, not upon 
the rocky foundation of any legal principle—either universally accepted or just 
newly discovered by a pioneering juridical or philosophical genius, not even 
upon any plausible legal maxim invented by a resourceful Lord Coke in support of 
a just or equitable solution of a controversy—but upon the haziness and broad 
meaning of an adjective; "personal."</p>
<p>The majority's syllogism starts from the following major premise:<em> All 
things personal abate and do not survive ivith the subject's death, and are 
intransmissible.</em></p>
<p>The thesis can not stand the least analysis. Everybody knows that almost all, 
if not all, things transmitted by the death of a person to his heirs are, or may 
be, designated as "personal." There are, in the first place, things which are 
classified as strictly personal goods, such as, furniture, money, shares, and 
other movable property. Even lands and buildings are "personal" property, as 
distinguished from conjugal or communal property. The paraphernal estate of a 
deceased wife is her "personal" property.</p>
<p>The consequences to which the majority's thesis leads are too obvious and too 
obviously senseless that we feel it needless to expose further its absolute lack 
of any foundation on reason or common sense, on logic or experience.</p>
<p>Now, if the majority, by adopting a novel and arbitrary lexicon, should want 
the adjective limited to a kind of personal things which, by their very nature, 
die with the subject's death, then the major premise of their syllogism must be 
restated to convey that sense.</p>
<p>But then such kind of personal things shall exclusively and absolutely 
comprise alone the organs and other parts of the physical body which dies at his 
death. Of course, they will not include his spirit, his thoughts, or the written 
words in which he had expressed them. Those thoughts, if of permanent value, 
such as those that sprang from the minds of great men, like Rizal or Mabini, or 
from the minds of great thinkers, never die and are transmitted to coming 
generations for mankind to cherish until the end of time.</p>
<p>Even the destructible parts of the physical body of a dead person, 
notwithstanding their superlative personal character, remain transmissible. The 
devilish leaders of Nazi Germany took full advantage of this fact at Maidanek 
where the remains of millions of men, women and children they massacred were 
used to fertilise their orchards and gardens.</p>
<p>The right of filing a complaint for the commission of a crime and the right 
to enforce that right by mandamus can not, surely, be identified with any 
physical limb or organ of the subject of those rights.</p>
<p>If by designating them as "personal" the majority wanted to convey the idea 
that they are exclusively personal, from which they concluded that they are 
intransmissible, they must feel that their theory is completely indefensible, 
when they had to seek refuge under an sphynxian silence, supplying the lack of 
ground and truth of their theory with the emphasis of an unreasoned assertion, 
made with the dogmatism of absolutists who would not countenance any discussion 
of, and would frown with Olympic disdain at, the challenge of an argument. 
"<em>Magister dixit ila est</em>."</p>
<p>Section 2 of Rule 106 is invoked by the majority to support the proposition 
that the right to file a complaint for the commission of a crime is personal and 
is used as a board from which to jump to the conclusion that it is also 
intransmissible.</p>
<p>They assume that because said section defines the complaint as "a sworn 
written statement charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the offended 
party, any peace officer or other employee of the government," no other party 
can sign or file it.</p>
<p>Evidently, the majority have lost sight of the provisions of section 5 of 
Rule 106, regarding sufficiency of criminal complaint or information, which 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 5. <em>Sufficiency of complaint or information</em>.—A complaint or 
information is sufficient if it states tlie name of the defendant; the 
designation of the offense by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of 
as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate 
time of the commission of the offense, and the place -wherein the offense was 
committed.</p>
<p>"When the offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be 
included in the complaint or information."</p></blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that, while section 2 of Rule 106 defines complaint as a 
"sworn written statement charging a person with an offense, subscribed by the 
offended party, any peace officer or other employee of the government or 
governmental institution in charge of the enforcement or execution of the law 
violated," section 5 thereof specifies the essential elements which would make a 
complaint sufficient. Among said elements, the signature "by the offended party, 
any officer or other employee of the government" is not mentioned. In other 
words, under section 5 of Rule 106, a complaint is sufficient although it does 
not bear the signature of the "offended party, any peace officer or other 
employee of the government." Said section admits even the possibility of a 
complaint not bearing the signature, not only of the persons mentioned in 
section 2, but also of any other person.</p>
<p>It must be so under the philosophy underlying our system of criminal law 
which, as it happens in all enlightened countries, starts frcm the principle 
that all criminal offenses undermines the social stability and orderliness of 
society and that the real offended party, aside from the actual victims 
themselves, is the people. An unmistakable statement of that philosophy 
underlying our system of criminal law appears in section 1 of Rule 106, which 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SECTION 1. <em>Commencement of criminal action.</em>—All criminal actions 
must be commenced either by complaint or information in the name of the People 
of the Philippines against all persons who appear to be responsible 
therefor."</p></blockquote>
<p>The error of the majority in insisting, in the present case, that the 
complaint for falsification of public documents ¦ in question did not survive 
upon the death of complainants Fernando and Marcos Guevarra, and in denying 
their surviving sons and brothers, Emilio and Ciriaco Guevarra, the right to 
continue these mandamus proceedings and to prosecute the complaint filed by the 
two deceased, starts from the primitive concept that the crime had offended 
exclusively the victims and that the victims are the only one's entitled to 
prosecute the culprits. All cultured persons ought to know that such an 
underlying concept is outworn and has been discarded, and is outgrown by a more 
advanced system of philosophy in criminal law. The fact, established by 
sociological studies and researches, that the tribes of remote antiquity would 
make reprisals and would even start tribal wars for offense committed against 
one of their members, is a conclusive proof that the primitive concept which we 
are refuting could have only been accepted before the existence of any organized 
human community.</p>
<p>In the present case, the sons and brothers of the deceased complainants, 
Emilio and Cirilo Guevarra, are, after all, as offended parties themselves as 
the deceased for two reasons:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Because, as sons and brothers of the victims of the alleged falsifications, 
they suffered almost as much as the deceased from the effects of the 
falsifications, as it is only natural to persons so closely related.</p>
</li><li>Because they themselves were later included as ac cused in the criminal 
proceedings in which the alleged falsifications were committed, as alleged 
co-authors of the murder imputed to the deceased, and the harm inflicted upon 
them by said proceedings appears self-evident, con sidering the fact that we had 
only recently, by unanimous decision, acquitted them of the crime charged in the 
in formation. (People vs. Guevarra, p. 415, ante.) </li></ol>
<p>We vote for the granting of the motion for substitution and of the prayer of 
the petition, concurred in by the Solicitor General himself in representation of 
the respondent Court of First Instance of Tayabas. The fact that the rules have 
been violated by the lower court more than two years ago and the relief sought 
in the petition, notwithstanding the Solicitor General's answer, has not been 
acted upon for that long period of time, instead of lessening petitioners' right 
to seek the relief prayed for makes stronger the plea for said relief. The law 
must be complied with. No excuses, no compromises, no circumventions should be 
allowed to defeat the unmistakable mandates of the law. Much less when in the 
complaint for falsification of public documents, which was illegally rejected by 
the lower court, the high interests of public morals and society are at stake. 
The fact that the crime was allegedly perpetrated by government officials, 
entrusted with the duty to keep watch over the law and to prosecute all kinds of 
lawlessness, makes more imperative that the petition should not be so lightly 
whitewashed.</p>
<p>The stern attitude of the law against all erring persons must not be relaxed 
because the alleged culprits are law officers. No violation of the law must be 
countenanced only because it will protect the erring officials or because the 
law is invoked by the weak, the defenseless, by one who is under indictment for 
an abhorrent crime, or by a moral leper, spurned by all his fellow citizens. The 
law is incompatible with the iniquities of discrimination.</p>
