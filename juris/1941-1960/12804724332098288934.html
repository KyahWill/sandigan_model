</style><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga 
convicting the appellants of double murder and sentencing them to two life 
imprisonments.
<p>It appears from the record that the victims of the crime were two Moro 
peddlers from Zamboanga City, named Jaila and Maadil, who, on June 13, 1952, 
went by boat to Sangbay Grande Island, within the jurisdiction of Basilan City, 
to collect debts due them from the two defendants, who lived there. With them 
was one Hairan Tumaguidguid, who, from Zamboanga also went to the said island to 
collect a debt from one Abuab. Passing the night of the day of their arrival in 
the house of Hairan's father, Panglima Tumaguidguid, the two peddlers went out 
the next day, and on meeting the defendants required them to pay. But their 
attempt to collect resulted in a brawl in the course of which defendant Masdal 
grabbed Maadil and wrestled his wrist watch. The brawl was, however, stopped by 
Maharaja Alpa or Arpa, the village headman, who advised the peddlers to go home, 
promising to return to them their watch himself in the afternoon.</p>
<p>When the afternoon came, the peddlers went to the house of Moro Alamanza 
whither they had been invited to play the <u>gabang</u>, a moro musical 
instrument, and also to show their wares to the wife of Alamanza, a prospective 
buyer. But while they were in that house, the defendants, one of them (Masdal) 
armed with a Thompson submachinegun and a <u>kris</u>, and the other (Salim) 
with a garand rifle and a <u>barong</u>, came before sunset and inquired of 
Alamanza, who was at the door, whether the two Joloanos, referring to the 
peddlers, were still there, at the same time telling Alamanza to send them down 
because they wanted to kill them. Alamanza asked why they wanted to kill the 
Joloanos when the trouble between them had already been fixed by the headman. 
But at that instant Jaila peeped at the door, and on seeing him, defendant 
Masdal shot him with his submachinegun. Jaila fell. At about the same time the 
other defendant, Salim, went to the batalan (back porch) and from there shot the 
other peddler, Maadil.</p>
<p>The shooting was witnessed not only by Alamanza but also by his wife, who was 
then in the kitchen preparing food for the two peddlers.</p>
<p>Alamanza and his wife fled while defendants were still firing into the house. 
But coming back later after leaving his wife in the house of a relative, 
Alamanza found the two peddlers lying on the ground dead, and at the place at 
the time were Maharaja Arpa, the defendants and the father of one of them. Going 
up the house, he found bullet holes on the walls and on their trunk and its 
contents.</p>
<p>The bodies of the peddlers were buried near the seashore by order of Arpa, 
who with the two defendants thereafter took Alamanza and his wife Hatija on a 
<u>vinta</u> to Zamboanga to report the killing to the authorities. But while on 
the way they were told to corroborate only what Arpa was going to report, with 
warning that they would be killed if they did not follow instructions. And due 
to these threats, Alamanza and his wife signed affidavits before the deputy clek 
of court in Zamboanga, corroborating what Arpa and the two defendants reported, 
which was to the effect that defendants killed the two peddlers in response to 
Hatija's call for help.</p>
<p>But Arpa's and defendants' attempt to conceal the crime was thwarted by 
Hairan Tumaguidguid, the woman who went with the peddlers to Sangbay Grande 
Island. Leaving the island by boat she went to Maluso district, where the seat 
of government was, and reported what had actually happened. She informed the 
acting chief of police there that the peddlers Maadil and Jaila had gone with 
her to Sangbay Grande Island from Zamboanga City for the purpose of collecting 
what the defendants owed them; that when the peddlers demanded payment from 
defendants the latter, who did not have money, got mad; that defendants Masdal, 
in the height of his temper, grabbed Maadil and took his wrist watch; that 
though the trouble was fixed by Maharaja Arpa, defendants shot and killed the 
peddlers in the afternoon of the same day in the house of Alamanza.</p>
<p>Alamanza and his wife were called to Isabela, the seat of the government of 
the City of Basilan, for questioning, and they there signed sworn statements 
before the municipal judge, revealing what really had happened and explaining 
that what they had stated in their previous affidavits before the acting clerk 
of court was not true and that they made such statements under threat of being 
killed.</p>
<p>About two moths after the killing, the bodies of the peddlers were dug out of 
their common grave near the seashore. But the medical officer who examined the 
cadavers found them to have decomposed to such an extent that it was no longer 
possible to determine the injuries that produce death. However, considering 
defendants' affidavit (Exhs. "4" and "5") that defendant Salim struck one of the 
peddlers on the neck, severing the head from the body, it is significant that 
the officer found "no fractures nor injuries on the skeletal remains."</p>
<p>Testifying at the trial, the defendants declared that in the afternoon in 
question, while the inhabitants of the village in Sangbay Grande Island were at 
the <u>mosque</u> praying and they themselves were in their own houses, they 
heard shouts for help coming from the house of Hatija, Alamanza's wife, saying 
that bandit were attacking her house. Coming to the rescue, defendants went to 
said house where, upon arrival, they saw two unknown persons jumped down, one 
holding a <u>barong</u> and the other a <u>kris</u>. Seeing that the two bandits 
were about to attack them, defendant Masdal slashed one of them with his 
<u>kris</u> while defendant Salim on his part hacked the other with his 
<u>barong</u>, as a result of which the two bandits were killed. The people who 
were in the <u>mosque</u>, who also heard shots, came to the house of Alamanza, 
but they arrived there after the bandits had already been killed. Among those 
who came to the place was Maharaja Arpa, who, after learning from defendants 
what had happened and finding nobody in the crowd who could identify the 
deceased, ordered them buried. On the following morning defendants went to 
Zamboanga City and reported the matter to the Philippine Constabulary and to the 
city mayor. They denied having threatened Alamanza and his wife.</p>
<p>Thetrial court found the facts to be substantially as above stated and 
convicted the defendants of double murder.</p>
<p>After going over the record we find no reason for disturbing the conclusions 
of fact made by the trial court, as the case hinges mostly on credibility, and 
the trial judge, who saw the witnesses testify and observed their demeanor on 
the witness stand was in a better position to appreciate their testimony than 
ourselves.</p>
<p>Two of the government witnesses, Alamanza and his wife, actually saw the 
killing and their account thereof is convincing. If in their first affidavits 
they have an entirely different version, it was because they were acting under 
threats from Maharaja Arpa and the defendants themselves. Their credibility is 
assailed by the defense on the theory that they must have had a grudge against 
defendants because some years before the father of one of the defendants had 
imputed the killing of one of his sons to the father of Hatija, Alamanza's wife. 
But it does not seem likely that for this alone, the spouses would invent lies 
that might send the defendants, their recent benefactors, to jail or to the 
electric chair.</p>
<p>The theory of the defense as to how the killing took place has nothing but 
defendants' own bias testimony to support it, unless we believe the first 
affidavits of Alamanza and his wife, which were repudiated by the couple 
themselves as being false and given under threats of death. The theory does not 
jibe with the fact that the deceased were by overwhelming proof shown to be no 
bandits at all but jewelry peddler who had gone to Sangbay Grande Island for the 
purpose of collecting money from the defendants. And if, as claimed by 
defendants the deceased were hacked to death and the head of one of them was 
severed from the body (as stated in their affidavit exhs. "4" and "5"), then why 
is it that their skeleletal remains show no signs of fracture or injury? 
Decomposition of the flesh may have obliterated the wounds; but the condition of 
the skeletons is mute testimony to the fact that, as declared by the prosecution 
witnesses, the victims were killed with bullets, and not with bladed weapons as 
claimed by the defense.</p>
<p>It appears certain, as testified to by Hairan Tumaguidguid, that the deceased 
had gone to Sangbay Grande Island to collect ehat the defendants owed them. And 
it is likewise certain that the defendants and the deceased had a brawl in the 
morning of the day of the killing. Though temporarily pacified by the village 
headman, the defendants must have resented the incident. So, taking advantage of 
the fact that the headman and many of the village inhabitants were in the 
<u>mosque</u> praying, defendants went to the house of Alamanza and attacked the 
deceased. The witness Hairan Tumaguidguid is have any motive for testifying 
falsely against them.</p>
<p>We agree with the Solicitor General that the crime committed is munder, for 
the attack was made with firearms and the victims were unarmed and with no means 
of defense or escape, trapped as they were inside a house. The killing was, 
therefore, committed with <u>alevosia</u>, so that the resulting crime was 
murder. And while according to the evidence one defendant killed one of the 
deceased and the other defendant the other deceased, both must answer for both 
killings, since it is obvious that they were acting in concert as if by 
agreement. Both appeared at the scene of the killing at the same time, both were 
armed to the teeth, and both used their weapons at almost the same time, 
actuated apparently by the same motive. These facts are proof of conspiracy and 
make the two defendants responsible for the killing of each of the deceased. 
Both are, therefore, guilty of two murders.</p>
<p>We must, however, appreciate in favor of the appellants the mitigating 
circumstance of volutary surrender, it appearing that after the killing they 
went to Zamboanga City to report to the authorities. The penalty for murder must 
therefore be imposed in its minimum degree. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence 
Law, the appellants are sentence each to an indeterminate penalty of from 10 
years and 1 day of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u> as minimum to 17 years, 4 months 
and 1 day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as maximum for each of the murder 
committed, with the accessory penalties of the law, to indemnify the heirs of 
the deceased Maadil in the sum of P6,000 and those of Jaila also in the sum of 
P6,000, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>Modified accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed, with cost.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</em> 
and <em>Reyes, J.B.L.,</em> concur.</p></div>
