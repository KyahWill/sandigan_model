				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner Aurea&nbsp; Matias&nbsp; seeks,a writ of certiorari to annul&nbsp; certain&nbsp;&nbsp; orders of Hon. Primitivo L. Gonzales, as Judge of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Cavite, in connection with Special Proceedings&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 5213&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; court, entitled "Testate Estate of&nbsp; the Deceased Gabina Raquel." <br><br>On&nbsp; May 15, 1952, Aurea&nbsp; Matias initiated said special proceedings with a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; the probate&nbsp; of a&nbsp; document purporting to&nbsp; be the last will and testament of&nbsp; her&nbsp; aunt, Gabina&nbsp; Raquel, who died single&nbsp; on May 8, 1952, at the age&nbsp; of 92&nbsp; years.&nbsp; The heir to&nbsp; the&nbsp; entire&nbsp; estate of the deceased—except the properties bequeathed&nbsp; to her other niece&nbsp; and&nbsp; nephews, namely,&nbsp; Victorina&nbsp; Salud,&nbsp; Santiago Salud,&nbsp;&nbsp; Policarpio&nbsp;&nbsp; Salud,&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; Matias&nbsp; and&nbsp; Rafael Matias—is,&nbsp; pursuant to said&nbsp; instrument,&nbsp; Aurea Matias, likewise,&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; therein&nbsp; as executrix&nbsp; thereof, without bond. Basilia Salud, a first cousin of the deceased, opposed the probate of her alleged will, and, after appropriate proceedings, the court, presided over&nbsp; by respondent Judge, issued an order,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; February 8, 1956, sustaining said opposition&nbsp; and&nbsp; denying the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for probate.&nbsp; Subsequently, Aurea Matias brought the matter on&nbsp; appeal to this Court&nbsp; (G.&nbsp; R. No. L-10751), where it is now pending decision. <br><br>Meanwhile,&nbsp; or on February&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1956, Basilia&nbsp; Salud moved for&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal of Horacio Rodriguez, as special administrator&nbsp; of the estate of the&nbsp; deceased, and the appointment,&nbsp; in his stead&nbsp; of Ramon Plata.&nbsp; The&nbsp; motion was set&nbsp; for&nbsp; hearing on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 23, 1956, on which date the court postponed&nbsp; the hearing&nbsp; to&nbsp; February 27, 1956.&nbsp; Al- though&nbsp; notified of this order,&nbsp; Rodriguez did not appear on the&nbsp; date&nbsp; last&nbsp; mentioned.&nbsp; Instead, he&nbsp; riled&nbsp; an urgent motion praying for&nbsp; additional&nbsp; time within which to answer the charges preferred against&nbsp; him by Basilia Salud and for another postponement of said hearing.&nbsp; This&nbsp; motion was not granted, and&nbsp; Basilia Salud introduced evidence in support of said charges, whereupon respondent Judge, by an order, dated February 27, 1956,&nbsp; found Rodriguez guilty of abuse of authority&nbsp; and&nbsp; gross&nbsp; negligence, and, accordingly, relieved him as&nbsp; special&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; of the estate of the deceased and&nbsp; appointed Basilia&nbsp; Salud as special administratrix thereof,&nbsp; to "be assisted&nbsp; and&nbsp; advised by her niece,&nbsp; Miss Victorina Salud," who "shall always act as aide, interpreter and&nbsp; adviser&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Basilia&nbsp; Salud."&nbsp; Said order,&nbsp; likewise,&nbsp; provided that&nbsp; "Basilia&nbsp; Salud&nbsp; shall be helped by Mr. Ramon Plata * *&nbsp; * who is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; appointed as&nbsp; co-administrator." <br><br>On March 8, 1956, Aurea Matias asked that said&nbsp; order of February 27, 1956, be set aside and that she be appointed special&nbsp; co-administratrix, jointly with Horacio Rodriguez, upon the ground that&nbsp; Basilia Salud is&nbsp; over eighty (80). years of age, totally blind and physically&nbsp; incapacitated to perform the duties of&nbsp; said&nbsp; office,&nbsp; and that said&nbsp; movant is the universal&nbsp; heiress of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; and the person appointed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter as executrix of her alleged&nbsp; will. This motion was denied in an order dated March 10, 1956, which&nbsp; maintained "the&nbsp; appointment of&nbsp; the three&nbsp; above- named persons"—Baailia&nbsp; Salud,&nbsp; Ramon Plata&nbsp; and&nbsp; Vic- torina Salud—"for the management of the estate&nbsp; of the late&nbsp; Gabina Raquel pending final. decision&nbsp; on the probate of the&nbsp; alleged will of said&nbsp; decedent."&nbsp; However, on&nbsp; March 17/1956, Basilia Salud tendered her resignation as&nbsp; special administratrix by reason of physical disability, due to old age, and recommended the appointment, in her place, of Victorina Salud.&nbsp; Before any action could be taken thereon, or on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; Aurea Matias&nbsp; sought a reconsideration of&nbsp; said order of March&nbsp; 10, 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; on March 24,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; she expressed&nbsp; her conformity to&nbsp; said resignation, but&nbsp; objected&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointment, in lieu of Basilia Salud, of Victorina Salud, on account of her antagonism to said Aurea Matias—she (Victorina Salud)&nbsp; hav- ing been the principal and most interested&nbsp; witness for the opposition&nbsp; to&nbsp; the probate of the&nbsp; alleged will of the deceased—and proposed that the administration of her estate be entrusted to the&nbsp; Philippine National&nbsp; Bank, the&nbsp; Monte de&nbsp; Piedad,&nbsp; the Bank of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Islands,&nbsp; or any other similar institution authorized by law therefor, should the&nbsp; court be&nbsp; reluctant to appoint&nbsp; the movant as&nbsp; special administratrix of said estate.&nbsp; This motion for reconsideration was denied on&nbsp; March 26, 1956. <br><br>Shortly afterwards,&nbsp; or&nbsp; on June 18, 1966, respondents Ramon Plata&nbsp; and Victorina Salud&nbsp; requested&nbsp; authority to collect the&nbsp; rents&nbsp; due,&nbsp; or which may be due, to the estate of the deceased and to collect all the produce of her lands, which was granted on June 23, 1956.&nbsp; On June 27, 1956, said respondents filed another motion praying for permis- sion to sell the palay&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased, then&nbsp; deposited in different rice mills in the province&nbsp; of Cavite, which respond- ent judge granted on June 10, 1956. Later on, or on July 10,&nbsp; 1956, petitioner instituted the&nbsp; present action&nbsp; against Judge Gonzales, and Victorina Salud and Ramon Plata, for&nbsp; the purpose of&nbsp; annulling the&nbsp; above mentioned&nbsp; orders&nbsp; of respondent Judge, upon the ground that the same had been issued&nbsp; with grave abuse of&nbsp; discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. <br><br>In support of this pretense, it is urged that&nbsp; petitioner should have preference in the choice of special adminis- tratrix of the estate of the decedent, she (petitioner)&nbsp; being :&nbsp; the universal heiress to said estate and the executrix ap- pointed in&nbsp; the alleged will of the deceased,&nbsp; that, until its&nbsp; final disallowance—which has not, as yet, taken place—she has a special interest in said estate, which must be protected&nbsp; by giving representation thereto in the management of said ; estate; that, apart from denying&nbsp; her any such representation, the management was given&nbsp; to persons&nbsp; partial to her main opponent, namely, Basilia Salud, inasmuch as Victorina Salud&nbsp; is allied to her and Ramon Plata is a&nbsp; very close&nbsp; friend&nbsp; of&nbsp; one of her&nbsp; (Basilia&nbsp; Salud's)&nbsp; attorneys;&nbsp; that Basilia Salud was made special administratrix despite her obvious unfitness for said office, she being over eighty (80) years of age and blind;&nbsp; that said&nbsp; disability is borne out by the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; on March 17, 1956, Basilia Salud resigned as special administratrix upon such ground; that the&nbsp; Rules of Court do not&nbsp; permit the appointment of more than one special administrator; that Horacio&nbsp; Rodriguez was removed without giving petitioner a chance to be heard in connection therewith; and that Ramon Plata&nbsp; and Victorina Salud were authorized&nbsp; to collect the rents due to the deceased and the produce of&nbsp; her lands, as well as to sell her palay, without previous notice to the petitioner&nbsp; herein. <br><br>Upon the other hand, respondents maintain that respond- ent Judge acted&nbsp; within the scope of his jurisdiction and without any abuse of discretion; that petitioner can not validly&nbsp; claim any special&nbsp; interest&nbsp; in&nbsp; the estate&nbsp; of the deceased, because the probate of the alleged will and testament of the latter—upon which petitioner relies—has been denied; that Horacio Rodriguez&nbsp; was duly notified of the proceedings for his removal;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that Victorina Salud and <br><br>Ramon Plata&nbsp; have not done anything that would warrant their removal. <br><br>Upon a review of the record, we find ourselves unable to sanction fully the acts of respondent Judge, for the&nbsp; following reasons: <br><blockquote><ol><li> Although Horacio Rodriguez had notice of the hearing: of the motion&nbsp; for his removal, dated February 17, 1956, the record shows&nbsp; that petitioner herein received copy of said motion of February 24, 1956, or the date <i>after</i> that set for the hearing thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, notice of the order of respondent Judge, dated February 23, 1956, postponing said hearing to February 27, 1956,&nbsp; was not served on petitioner herein. <br></li><li> In her motion&nbsp; of February 17,&nbsp; 1956, Basilia Salud prayed for the&nbsp; dismissal of&nbsp; Horacio&nbsp; Rodriguez, and&nbsp; the appointment of&nbsp; <i>Ramon Plata</i>, as special administrator of said estate. Petitioner had, therefore, no&nbsp; notice that&nbsp; her main, opponent,&nbsp; <i>Basilia&nbsp; Salud</i>, and the&nbsp; latter's principal witness,&nbsp; <i>Victorina Salud</i>, would be considered for the man- agement of said estate.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a consequence, said&nbsp; petitioner had&nbsp; no opportunity to&nbsp; object to the appointment&nbsp; of Basilia Salud&nbsp; as special administratrix,&nbsp; and&nbsp; of Victorina&nbsp; Salud as her assistant&nbsp; and adviser, and the order of February 27, 1956, to this effect,&nbsp; denied&nbsp; due process&nbsp; to&nbsp; said petitioner. <br></li><li>Said order&nbsp; was issued with evident knowledge of the physical disability of Basilia Salud.&nbsp; Otherwise respondent Judge&nbsp; would not have directed that she "be assisted and advised by her niece Victorina Salud&nbsp; and that the latter "shall&nbsp; act as aide, interpreter and adviser of Basilia Salud." <br></li><li> Thus, respondent Judge, in effect, appointed three&nbsp; (3) special administrators—Basilia Salud, Victorina Salud and Ramon Plata.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; in the order of March&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1956, respondent Judge maintained "the <i>appointment</i> of the three (3)&nbsp; above-named persons&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; management of&nbsp; the estate&nbsp; of the late Gabina Raquel." <br></li><li> Soon .after&nbsp; the institution of said Special Proceedings No. 5213, an issue arose&nbsp; between Aurea Matias and Basilia P. Salud regarding the person to be appointed special admin- istrator of the estate of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; The former proposed Horacio Rodriguez,&nbsp; whereas&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter urged the appointment of Victorina Salud.&nbsp; By&nbsp; an order dated August 11,&nbsp; 1952, the Court, then&nbsp; presided over by&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; Jose Bernabe, Judge, decided the matter in&nbsp; favor of Horacio Rodriguez and against Victorina Salud,&nbsp; upon the ground that, unlike the latter, who,&nbsp; as a pharmacist and employee in the Santa Isabel Hospital, resides&nbsp; in the City of Manila, the&nbsp; former, a practicing lawyer and&nbsp; a former public prosiecutor, and later, mayor of the City of Cavite, is a resident thereof.&nbsp; In other words, the order of respondent Judge of&nbsp; February 27,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; removing&nbsp; Rodriguez and appointing Victorina Salud to the management of the estate, amounted to a reversal of the aforementioned order of Judge Bernabe of August 11, 1952.<br><br></li><li> Although the probate&nbsp; of the alleged will and&nbsp; testa- ment of&nbsp; Gabina Eaquel was denied&nbsp; by respondent Judge, the&nbsp; order to this effect is not, as yet, final and executory. It is&nbsp; pending review on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; taken by Aurea Matias. The probate of said alleged&nbsp; will being still&nbsp; within the realm of legal possibility, Aurea Matias&nbsp; has—as the&nbsp; uni- versal heir and executrix designated in said instrument— a special interest to protect during the&nbsp; pendency of&nbsp; said appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thns, in the case of Roxas vs.&nbsp; Pecson *&nbsp; (46 Off. Gaz., 2058), this&nbsp; Court held that a&nbsp; widow, designated as executrix in the alleged will and testament of her deceased husband, the&nbsp; probate&nbsp; of which had&nbsp; been&nbsp;&nbsp; denied&nbsp; in an order pending appeal, "has&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; <i>the same beneficial</i> interest after the&nbsp; decision of the court&nbsp; disapproving the will, which is now pending&nbsp; appeal,<i> because the decision, is not yet final and 'may be reversed by the appellate court."</i> <br></li><li> The record shows that there are,&nbsp; at&nbsp; least two (2) factions among the heirs of&nbsp; the deceased,&nbsp; namely, one, represented by the petitioner,&nbsp; and another,&nbsp; to which Basilia Salud and Victorina&nbsp; Salud belong.&nbsp; Inasmuch as the lower court had deemed it&nbsp; best to appoint&nbsp; more than one special administrator, justice and equity demands&nbsp; that both factions be represented in the management of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of the deceased. </li></ol></blockquote>The rule, laid down in Roxas vs. Pecson (supra), to the effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; "only&nbsp; one&nbsp; special&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; may&nbsp; be appointed to administrator temporarily" the estate of the deceased, must be considered in the light of the facts obtaining in said case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower&nbsp; court appointed therein one special administrator for&nbsp; some properties forming part of said estate,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a special administratrix for other prop- erties&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; there were <i>two</i>&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; separate&nbsp; and independent special&nbsp; administrators.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar there is only <i>one</i>&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; special <i>administration</i>, the powers of which&nbsp; shall be exercised&nbsp; jointly&nbsp; by two special&nbsp; <i>co-administrators</i>.&nbsp; In short,&nbsp; the Roxas case is&nbsp; nob squarely in point.&nbsp; Moreover, there&nbsp; are&nbsp; authorities in support of the power of courts to appoint several special co-administrators (Lewis vs. Logan,&nbsp; 87&nbsp; A. 750; Harrison vs.&nbsp; Clark, 52 A.&nbsp; 514; In&nbsp; re Wilson's&nbsp; Estate,&nbsp; 61 N.Y.S. 2d., 49; Davenport vs. Davenport, 60 A. 379). <br><br>Wherefore,,&nbsp; the&nbsp; orders complained&nbsp; of are hereby an nulled and&nbsp; set aside.&nbsp; The lower court should re-hear the matter of&nbsp; removal of Horatio Rodriguez and appointment of special administrators,&nbsp; after due&nbsp; notice to all&nbsp; parties concerned,&nbsp; for action&nbsp; in conformity&nbsp; with the&nbsp; views&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; herein, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against respondents&nbsp; Victorina Salud&nbsp; and Ramon&nbsp; Plata.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so&nbsp; ordered. <br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; reyes, A., Bautista angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
