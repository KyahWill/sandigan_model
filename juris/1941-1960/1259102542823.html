				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal from an  order of the Court of First Instance of Camarines  Norte, Hon. Melquiades G. Ilao, presiding, dismissing an information upon a motion to  quash  filed by defense counsel on  the ground that two  distinct offenses, namely, libel and threats, are  alleged in  the information. The information filed by the fiscal is as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The  undersigned Fiscal accuses  Ciriaco Yebra of the crime of Libel, committed as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That on or about February 7, 1958, in the Municipality of Daet, Province of Camarines Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this  Honorable  Court,  the  above-named  accused, Ciriaco  Yebra, moved by  personal  resentment  and,  with an evident intention of imputing an act or circumstance tending to dishonor or discredit one Luciano Sta. Catalina, and  injure his good name and reputation  did then  and there  willfully, unlawfully, feloniously, publicly, and maliciously impute, threaten and make  against the said  Luciano Sta. Catalina, in a letter written  and  sent  by  said  accused  to  one Narciso  Dames, the following derogatory statements threatening to  inflict upon the said Luciano  Sta.  Catalina a wrong amounting to  a  crime, that is,  to kill the said Luciano Sta.  Catalina,  to  wit:</p>
    <p>* * * Huwag nilang  ipagmatigas and paglilinglang ni Luciano Sta. Catalina sa mga tao" * * *</p>
    <p>"at kung hindi babayaran ni Sta. Catalina  ang mga nagugol ko  o ang  nagugol ninyo sa  donasiyong ito  ay maka-aasa kayo na  ang gagawin ko ay buhay sa buhay laban so  mga taong ito na  manlilinglang sa ating baryo at sa Kapangyarihan  ng ating goviemo sa  wakas ng lahat kong sinabi dito ay  umaasa ako na hindi mo  pagkakaitan ang kahilingan ko."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>which statements are fabricated, false, and without foundation in truth and in  fact, and made solely to dishonor, discredit and to besmirch the good name  and  reputation of the said Luciano Sta. Catalina, as a result of which the said Luciano Sta. Catalina suffered damages, both moral and  actual in the  amount of P10,000.00. </p>
  <p>Contrary to Article 355 of the  Revised Penal Code. </p>
  <p>Daet, Camarines Norte, July 3,  1958."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That portion  of the  letter  sent  by  Ciriaco  Yebra  to Narciso Dames,  barrio lieutenant, which is  quoted in the information, may be translated, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  *  *  They must not be stubborn about  Mr. Luciano Sta. Catalina's fooling the people  *  *  *."</p>
  <p>"* * * And if there is nobody who will care among the authorities in the government  in this request of my being belittled and the belittling of others  and if Sta. Catalina will not pay what I paid and others paid far the donation,  you  can be  sure that  I will do, life for  a  life;  against those people who have been  fooling  our barrio and  to the  authorities  in the government, I hope they will not withhold all what  I  said (asked)  in this respect."  (pp. 5-6, Brief for the  Appellant.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Solicitor  General,  in his brief  before Us, argues that  even if two  distinct offenses are alleged in the  information, namely,  libel and  threats, the second offense of threat  is not  clearly imputed therein; the expressions "life for  life against those people who  have been fooling our barrio"  or "tooth for a tooth,"  may reveal  the anger the  accused  may have been engulfed, at the  time he expressed them, but does not show  an intent  to  kill.  He argues, therefore, that such  statements  may be treated as mere surplusage in the information.</p>
<p>We have carefully read the  letter containing the alleged libelous  remarks, and we find that the letter  is  more threatening  than  libelous,  and the  intent to threaten  is the  principal aim and object  of the letter.  The libelous remarks  contained in  the  letter, if so they  be considered, are  merely preparatory remarks culminating in the final threat.   In other  words, the libelous remarks express the heat of  passion  which  engulfs the writer  of the  letter, which heat of passion in the  latter part of  the  letter culminates into a threat.  This  is the  more important and serious offense committed by the accused.  Under  these circumstances this  Court  believes,  after a  study of the whole letter,  that the offense committed therein is clearly and principally that  of threats and  that  the statements therein derogatory  to a person named do  not constitute an  independent crime of libel, for which the writer may be  prosecuted  separately  from  the  threats  and  which should be considered as  part  of the more important offense of threats.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations,  the order of the  court dismissing  the information  on  the  ground of duplicity should be, as  it is  hereby, set  aside,  and the  case is  remanded to the court below for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.  Without costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C. J., Bengzon,  Padilla, Bautista  Angela,  Concepcion,  Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
