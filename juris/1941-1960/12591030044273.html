				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>From  the order of the  Court of  First  Instance of Davao (in Case No. 2033)  dismissing their complaint, on the ground of their  lack  of legal capacity to bring,the action, plaintiffs Miguel Gamao and Amando Gamao nave taken this appeal. </p>
<p>In their complaint  filed with the above-mentioned court on July 24,4956, plaintiffs alleged that they are the only surviving children and heirs of one Sulutan Culaman, who died in Digos, Davao, in March, 1929; that at the time of his  death,  Culaman was the  owner, possessor,  and occupant, adversely, publicly, and continuously, of a parcel of land and all its improvements,  designated  as Lot  No. 1685, Cad. 275, then covered by Free  Patent  Application No.  35766 filed with  the Bureau of Lands, which is  still subsisting; that Lot ifo. 1690 was originally a portion of Lot No. 1685, but was segregated and designated as such, upon the construction of the,national  highway at Digos; that said Lot No. 1690 continued, however, to be covered by said free patent application of Culaman; that on June 30, 1956, they, executed  an extrajudicial  agreement  adjudicating to  themselves  said Lots Nos. 1685 and 1690; that sometime in  1938, while they were still  minors, defendant  Basilia Bualan  was allowed  by Benedicta Bara (second wife of Culaman) to build her house on a portion of said Lot No.  1690; that without their knowledge  and consent, defendant Bualan fraudulently filed Free Patent Application No.  64345 over said Lot No. 1690,  by misrepresenting that it was a portion  of the lot  covered by PW Patent  Application  Ho. 23316 of Benedicta Bara and that the latter relinquished in her favor said  portion; that the  land of Benedicta Bara  covered by  said Free Patent Application  No. 23316  is designated as  Lot  No. 1686, Cad. 276, and is situated on  the  north of '  Lot  No. 1685; that on December 13, 1946,  defendants  Dominador C. Calamba and Bualan executed a  deed of sale, whereby Bualan sold to Calamba said Lot No.  1690, fraudulently misrepresenting in said  deed that the same was a portion of the land of Benedicta Bara, Lot No. 1686,  covered by Free Patent Application No.  23316 when it was not so; that,by virtue of said  deed of sale, defendant Calamba was  able to  file Free Patent  Application No. V-16391 covering Lot  No. 1690 and, on the  strength thereof, was able to mislead defendant Director of Lands to  reject and cancel Free Patent Application No. 64045 of  defendant Bualan and to give due course, instead, to Calamba'a application; that due  to said fraudulent misrepresentations of defendants Bualan  and Calamba, Free Patent  No. V-8578 was issued to Calamba on February 25, 1955,  on the basis  of which,  Original Certificate of Title No. 4838 covering Lot  No.  1690, wafrissued by the Register  of Deeds of Davao on April 23, 1956; and that said  Original Certificate of Title No, 4838 is void, because it was secured by defendant  Calamba through fraud.   Plaintiffs prayed that  said certificates  of title  be cancelled and revoked, and that defendants Bualan and Calamba be ordered to pay to them P3,000.00 as damages  and attorney's fees.</p>
<p>To said complaint,  defendants  Calamba and  Bualan filed a motion  to dismiss,  on  September 19, 1956, on  the grounds that  (1) plaintiffs have no  legal capacity to sue, they  not being the  real parties in  interest, and  (2)  the complaint states  no cause  of action.  Plaintiffs filed an answer (opposition) to said motion, on Septemper 29,1956, and a supplementary  answer on October 13, 1956. </p>
<p>On October 17, 1956,  the court dismissed plaintiffs? complaint,  in an order which  reads: </p>
<p align="center">"ORDER </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Plaintiffs admitted in paragraph 12 of the complaint, that the patent for the land in question was issued in the name'of defendant   Calamba "on February 25, 1955. </p>
  <p>"Present case was filed on July 24, 1956, one year and five months after the issuance of the  patent, on the ground that said patent was issued in the name of defendant Calamba through frauds and misrepresentations.</p>
  <p>"In view of the foregoing, the  Court has no jurisdiction to review the decree issued by the Director of Lands for the land in question.</p>
  <p>"The  land in question  is a public land for  which a  patent was issued.  In accordance with the  provisions of  the public  land law, the Solicitor General is the one called upon to prosecute and seek the annulment of the patent issued through fraud and misrepresentations.</p>
  <p>"The plaintiffs  have no legal personality to prosecute the present case.</p>
  <p>"WHEREFORE, thcr Court finding the motion to dismiss well taken, orders the dismissal of this case, without special  pronouncement as to the costs of the  proceedings.</p>
  <p>"SO ORDERED."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this order of the lower court, plaintiffs have appealed to us.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs claim  that  the lower court erred in holding that they have no legal capacity  to bring the action and, consequently, in dismissing their  complaint.</p>
<p>The lower court correctly dismissed the complaint.  It appears from the face thereof that the plaintiffs  have as yet acquired no title to the lot in question to entitle them to  sue  in  their own right.   They are  mere applicants thereto, their  application  (Free  Patent  Application No. 35766)  being  still pending  approval  by the  Director of Lands.   The  land  subject  of their  application which, allegedly,  includes the portion (Lot No. 1690) titled in the name of defendant Calamba,  is still public land and, therefore,  subject to  the  exclusive and executive  control and jurisdiction of the Director of Lands.   Nowhere is it alleged in their complaint that they have called the attention of the Director  of  Lands to the overlapping of their application and that  of defendant  Galamba  which became the basis  of the  latter's patent and subsequent certificate of title; much less that such conflict has already been investigated and  decided by that official.  In other words, plaintiffs have not exhausted their administrative remedies. The mere fact that a patent and a title have already been issued to defendant Calamba aoes not preclude administrative investigation by the Director of  Lands,  who, if he Unds  that there  was Mud in obtaining the  same, may himself  or in  representation of  the  Republic  of  the Philippines file an appropriate action for the  cancellation of the patent and title or for the reversion  of  the land to the public domain, as the case may  be.  As it is, Calamba's additional  contention that the complaint alleges no cause of action is likewise correct.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the plaintiffs-appellants.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Bautista Ahgelo,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
