				G.R. No. L-2130, May 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>FRANCISCO SANCHEZ, PETITIONER, VS. PEDRO SERRANO AND SOTERO RODAS, JUDGE OF COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Civil case No. 1709 of the Court of First Instance of Manila 
was set for trial on November 5, 1947, but on October 31 attorney for defendant, 
petitioner herein, asked for postponement and without awaiting for the 
resolution fo the court therein he left for Mindoro to campaign for his 
candidacy. The court postponed the trial to November 13, but notice thereof was 
not received by defendant's attorney who left no clerk in his law office and 
limited himself to asking an employee of a physician to make visits to that 
office. Trial was held on November 13, and a decision was rendered against 
defendant which he received on Jaunary 14, 1948. On January 23, 1948, he filed a 
motion to set aside the decision, under rule 38, but the motion was denied. On 
March 16, 1948, petitioner filed another motion to the same effect which was 
also denied. In the order of denial execution of the judgment was ordered. 
Petitioner filed his notice of appeal and appeal bond an ta the same time filed 
a motion to suspend the execution of the judgment during the pendency of the 
appeal, but the motion was denied. Hence, the present petition for certiorari 
wherein it is prayed that the judgment rendered, and its execution issued, by 
the respondent judge, as well as his order denying the motion for relief filed 
under Rule 38, be set aside because of a grave abuse of discretion therein 
committed.
<p align="justify">Without considering the merits or demerits of the motion to set 
aside filed under Rule 38, we believe the present petition is improper, the 
remedy being an appeal which has already been interposed. As to the suspension 
of the execution of the judgment, the remedy si provided in section 5, of said 
rule. In other words, when the petition for relief under Rule 38 was filed, 
motion for suspension of the execution of judgment could have been presented 
then or hereafter under section 5, of said rule, by offering the bond therein 
provided and if denied it may be renewed on appeal. Such suspension cannot 
properly be examined in certiorari proceedings separately from the motion to set 
aside which shall be reviewed on appeal, for it depends in great apart form the 
circumstances constituting the background of the principal relief to be 
considered on appeal. Under the circumstances disclosed in the record before us, 
it is not clear the the refusal to suspend execution is a grave abuse of 
discretion, it being apparent that petitioner's failure to receive notice of the 
trial held on November 13 was due to his negligence in leaving Manila without 
awaiting for the resolution fo the court on his motion for continuance, and also 
to his failure to provide his law office with some responsible clerk to receive 
notices, and his first motion for relief was filed only on January 22, 1948.</p> <i>Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Tuason,
