				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Certiorari&nbsp; against the decision&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals, 3rd Division, which, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the order of August&nbsp; 30, 1952 of the respondent judge,&nbsp; the Hon. Hermogenes Caluag.&nbsp; (Appendix B)&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; set aside.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Quezon decision&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Q-64 is&nbsp; not&nbsp; enforceable&nbsp; against&nbsp; her alleged rights to&nbsp; one-half of the property involved in said case. Let evidence bo presented to determine&nbsp; solely the question of whether or not petitioner&nbsp; Catalina M.&nbsp; de Leon&nbsp; is a successor in interest by&nbsp; title&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp; to&nbsp; the commencement of the action&nbsp; in Civil Case No. Q-64 as&nbsp; contemplated by Rule 39, sec. 44 (b),&nbsp; Thereafter let&nbsp; the proper action be taken by the court a&nbsp; quo as its findings after the hearing&nbsp; herein ordered may warrant. It? is so checked."</blockquote>In&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. Q-64, a&nbsp; complaint for injunction was instituted&nbsp; by Petronilo&nbsp; Castañeda&nbsp; against&nbsp; Rosario B. de Leon and&nbsp; her&nbsp; husband,&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; de Leon, to&nbsp; restrain the latter&nbsp; from fencing the lot known&nbsp; as Lot No.&nbsp; 11, Block K-19&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Diliman&nbsp; Estate Subdivision and&nbsp; from making construction thereon&nbsp; and to&nbsp; pay damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Q-64 was filed&nbsp; on October&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; and judgment in&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff&nbsp; having been&nbsp; rendered a writ of execution was issued on February&nbsp; 6, 1952,&nbsp; directing the defendants to demolish&nbsp; a house and other improvements erected on the land.&nbsp; This writ of execution was served upon&nbsp; Catalina de Leon, who claims to be the owner of the house and the&nbsp; other&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; on&nbsp; the land.&nbsp; As&nbsp; Catalina de Leon refused to remove the house and the other improvements, the judge issued an order requiring her to appear and explain why&nbsp; the building&nbsp; and the other improvements should not be&nbsp; demolished.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complying&nbsp; with this order, Catalina de Leon filed a written explanation in which she claims that she was not a&nbsp; party in civil&nbsp; case No;. Q-64; that&nbsp; she acquired right&nbsp; to&nbsp; one-half of the land from the&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; Rosario&nbsp; de Leon 'and&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; de Leon for P1,000, and that&nbsp; the latter in turn acquired&nbsp; the whole parcel from Perfecta&nbsp; Roque&nbsp; and Aurelio Bautista on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1949;&nbsp; that Catalina&nbsp; de Leon caused&nbsp; the portion&nbsp; sold to&nbsp; her to be&nbsp; fenced and&nbsp; order the erection of two houses of strong materials with the&nbsp; consent of&nbsp; her predecessors-in-interest,&nbsp; Rosario&nbsp; de&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; and Perfecta Roque;&nbsp; that after the first sale&nbsp; of the property in&nbsp; July, 1949 to Rosario B. de Leon&nbsp; and&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; de Leon, Perfecta&nbsp; Roque and her husband&nbsp; again sold&nbsp; the land&nbsp; to Petronilo Castañeda, who offered to buy the&nbsp; same&nbsp; for a&nbsp; higher price,&nbsp; but that this&nbsp; second sale&nbsp; by&nbsp; Perfects Roque was&nbsp; executed without first rescinding the former sale to Rosario&nbsp; B. de Leon and&nbsp; Francisco de Leon; that previous to the&nbsp; sale by&nbsp; Perfecta Roque&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; to Petronilo Castañeda, Rosario B.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Leon and&nbsp; Francisco de Leon brought an&nbsp; action in the Court of First Instance of Manila for specific performance&nbsp; (No. 9386),&nbsp; and this case resulted in&nbsp; a decision of December 22, 1950, ordering Perfecta Roque to return P900 to plaintiff therein, Bosario B.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Leon, but that the spouses Rosario de Leon and Francisco de Leon, having had some family&nbsp; trouble with Catalina de Leon,&nbsp; connived&nbsp; with&nbsp; Perfecta&nbsp; Roque and Petronilo Castañeda&nbsp; to have the case dismissed&nbsp; to the prejudice of Catalina de Leon; and that before&nbsp; the final disposition of the action in said civil case No. 9366 Perfects Roque had sold&nbsp; the&nbsp; property to another buyer, Petronilo Castañeda,&nbsp; on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 3, 1949;&nbsp; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; the subsequent suit that Castañeda&nbsp; brought against&nbsp; Rosario B.&nbsp; de Leon, No.&nbsp; Q-64,&nbsp; Catalina&nbsp; de&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; asked for permission&nbsp; to intervene but the court denied&nbsp; the same.<br><br>Upon the submission&nbsp; of the above explanation,&nbsp; Petronilo Castañeda&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; opposition alleging that it&nbsp; is not true that Catalina de Leon&nbsp; was&nbsp; not aware of&nbsp; the proceedings between Rosario B. de Leon and Petronilo Castañeda.&nbsp; Upon the filing of this&nbsp; opposition, the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that the&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; Catalina de Leon on the property was a contingent one based upon the ultimate consummation of the sale between Francisco and&nbsp; Rosario de&nbsp; Leon on&nbsp; one hand,&nbsp; and Perfecta&nbsp; Roque and Aurelio&nbsp; Bautista on the other; that as the action that Rosario&nbsp; B.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Leon and&nbsp; her&nbsp; husband brought against Perfecta Roque terminated in a dismissal,&nbsp; no right whatsoever&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; by the claimant&nbsp; Catalina&nbsp; de Leon.&nbsp; In consequence that court&nbsp; found the explanation of Catalina de&nbsp; Leon without merit and&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the removal of&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; and the&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; that Catalina&nbsp; de Leon had constructed on the property.&nbsp; It is against this order that the case was brought to the Court of Appeals, in which&nbsp; the court finally decided the controversy in its order above quoted.<br><br>It will be seen from the order&nbsp; under consideration that the only issue directed to be determined&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the return of the case to the court below is&nbsp; whether or not Catalina de&nbsp; Leon may be considered as a privy to the rights&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; Rosario B.&nbsp; de Leon and Francisco&nbsp; de Leon in civil case No. Q-64, in which Petronilo&nbsp; Castañeda is plaintiff.&nbsp; Upon the resolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; that issue the question as&nbsp; to whether or not the improvements of Catalina de&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; would be&nbsp; removed would&nbsp; be&nbsp; decided,&nbsp; accord- ing to the decision appealed from.&nbsp; It is true&nbsp; that Catalina de&nbsp; Leon would&nbsp; be bound by the judgment in Q-64 if she is&nbsp; a privy to&nbsp; Rosario de&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; and Francisco&nbsp; de, Leon, defendants in the action.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the facts and circumstances disclosed in the explanation of Catalina de Leon show that she had purchased the one-half portion of the land in&nbsp; good faith and&nbsp; also constructed her two houses and the&nbsp; fence surrounding the lot also in good faith.&nbsp; And we can&nbsp; not agree&nbsp; that the limited issue remanded to the trial court for determination would and&nbsp; can finally determine fully and completely the correlative rights&nbsp; and obligations of Petronilo Castañeda,&nbsp; the apparent owner&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Catalina de&nbsp; Leon,&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of the house and&nbsp; the other&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals, while not containing any statement to the effect that the correlative rights of the said parties hava to&nbsp; be decided&nbsp; in an independent&nbsp; suit, may be&nbsp; interpreted to Mean that&nbsp; the decision of the issue as&nbsp; to whether&nbsp; Catalina&nbsp; de Leon&nbsp; is&nbsp; a privy would also determine&nbsp; said&nbsp; correlative&nbsp; rights.&nbsp; Catalina&nbsp; de&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; is not&nbsp; a party to the action&nbsp; instituted by&nbsp; Petronilo&nbsp; Castañeda against Rosario de Leon and her husband,&nbsp; and her attempt to intervene&nbsp; was denied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The explanation filed by&nbsp; Catalina de&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below seems&nbsp; to show that she acquired&nbsp; her rights to the properties,&nbsp; consisting of one-half of the land and&nbsp; two houses and&nbsp; other&nbsp; improvements built thereon, prior to the acquisition of the land&nbsp; by Petronilo&nbsp; Castañeda.&nbsp; Anyway, Catalina de Leon bought one-half of the land on October 5, 1949&nbsp; and the action that Castaneda against Rosario de Leon&nbsp; was subsequent thereto, i.e., on October 17, 1949. Furthermore,&nbsp; it does&nbsp; not appear that any notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>lis penden</i>s was ever noted on the title of the property before Catalina de Leon built the house&nbsp; and made the improvements&nbsp; on the&nbsp; land.<br><br>The&nbsp; problem&nbsp; that has arisen proceeds from the fact that Perfecta&nbsp; Roque had sold the residential&nbsp; land to two vendees,&nbsp; first to Rosario B. de Leon&nbsp; and later to Petronilo Castañeda.&nbsp;&nbsp; If justice is&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; done to&nbsp; the rights&nbsp; of Rosario B.&nbsp; de Leon's vendee,&nbsp; Catalina de Leon, who had constructed two houses&nbsp; and a fence&nbsp; on one-half of&nbsp; the residential&nbsp; lot in question, complicated&nbsp; questions of fact and&nbsp; good faith will have to be investigated&nbsp; and decided and&nbsp; certainly this&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; done in the proceedings for execution.&nbsp; The question can be decided fairly and justly only in an&nbsp; ordinary suit between&nbsp; the parties,&nbsp; as&nbsp; the correlative rights and&nbsp; obligations of owner and builder were never at issue in civil case No. Q-64 because Catalina&nbsp; de Leon was not&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; to be a party to the&nbsp; suit.<br><br>For&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing considerations, the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; affirmed insofar as it sets aside the order of demolition issued by respondent judge, Hon. Hermogenes&nbsp; Caluag, on August 30, 1952, but that portion thereof&nbsp; which&nbsp; directs&nbsp; the ease&nbsp; to be remanded to the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; for&nbsp; determination if Catalina de Leon may be considered&nbsp; a privy to Rosario de Leon, is hereby set aside; and it is hereby declared&nbsp; and ordered that the correlative&nbsp; rights&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Petronilo&nbsp; Castaneda&nbsp; and Catalina de Leon&nbsp; to the land&nbsp; and the improvements&nbsp; thereon&nbsp; be decided in&nbsp; a separate action.&nbsp; No costs in the appeal.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
