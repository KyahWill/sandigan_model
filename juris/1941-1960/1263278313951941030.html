				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to enjoin the Honorable Manuel Blanco, Judge of Iloilo, 
from taking further steps in election case No. 1040, entitled Dr. Jose F. 
Monsale, contestant, <em>versus</em> Paulino M. Nico, contestee. 
<p>It appears that on December 8, 1947, Dr. Monsale protested the proclamation 
of Paulino M. Nico as mayor-elect of Miagao, Iloilo, by a petition alleging, 
among other things, that in the elections of November, 1947, both had duly filed 
their respective certificates of candidacy for the office of mayor of Miagao; 
that he was duly voted for by the qualified electors of said municipality and 
received 2991 votes as against 2291 votes cast for the protestee, and that the 
boards of election inspectors in all precincts of the said municipality 
fraudulently and illegally did not count the ballots in his favor, resulting in 
the unwarranted proclamation of said contestee Paulino M. Nico. </p>
<p>After being summoned, the latter filed a motion for dismissal of the protest, 
on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to act on the matter, because 
Dr. Jose F. Monsale was not a registered candidate voted for in the aforesaid 
elections. In support of his motion, contestee submitted copy of the telegram 
flent by the Commission on Elections to the municipal secretary of Miagao on 
November 9, 1947, stating that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view withdrawal of Jose Monsale on October ten * * * he can no longer be 
a candidate in spite his desire to withdraw his withdrawal stop Jose Monsale is 
therefore no longer a candidate". </p></blockquote>
<p>Replying to the motion, Dr. Monsale argued that to confer jurisdiction upon 
the court it was enough to allege — as he did — that the parties were duly 
qualified voters, were candidates inscribed and had been voted for. He also 
claimed that it was premature for contestee to bring up at that time the 
reported withdrawal of his candidacy, which is a matter of evidence to be 
threshed out when the case is debated on the merits.</p>
<p>The court set a date for admission of proofs to establish the motion to 
dismiss. Documents were introduced on both sides. After considering the same 
Judge Blanco provisionally refused to dismiss, explaining that, "por resultar de 
la prueba (el Exh. A) articulada, sobre la moción de sobreseimiento de la 
solicitud, que el recurrente habia avisado en 6 noviembre 1947 a la Comision 
Electoral que daba por retirado lo manifestado a ella por él en 10 octubre 1947 
y que continuaba adelanto con su candidatura para el cargo de alcalde del 
municipio de Miagao, de este provincia; sin juzgar por ahora, por entenderlo 
prematura, el efecto legal de esa cuestión, dadas los alegaciones de la 
solicitud". Said judge therefore ordered the contestee to answer the motion of 
protest. </p>
<p>This petition for certiorari was immediately submitted to us, upon the 
allegation that respondent Judge Blanco had acted without or in excess of 
jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>It will be observed that although Judge Blanco declined to dismiss, he 
expressly reserved opinion about the legal effect of Dr. Monsale's cancellation 
of the withdrawal of his candidacy, which was the gist of the challenge to the 
court's jurisdiction. In effect the order was a <em>provisional</em> denial 
until the protest is adjudged on the merits. Consequently petition has no basis, 
the court not having definitely ruled on the issue of jurisdiction. If 
petitioner should counter that it was a grave abuse of discretion for the court 
to postpone definite action on his petition for dismissal, the answer would be 
that our rules expressly permit judges "to defer action on such motions until 
the trial, if the ground alleged therein does not appear to be indubitable" 
(Rule 8, section 2). That the point raised in the motion is not so easy to solve 
is shown by the circumstance that here, among the members, there is no unanimous 
view. Anyway it is quite probable that had Judge Blanco categorically overruled 
I herein petitioner's contention, still his remedy would be to raise the same 
question when he appeals from an adverse decision on the merits.</p>
<p>It follows from the foregoing considerations that this petition must be, as 
it is hereby, denied, with costs. So ordered.</p><em>Parás, Actg. C. J., Feria, 
Pablo, Briones, Padilla,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>
<hr shade="" no="" align="center" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING </em></p>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>:</strong> </p>
<p>The procedural grounds stated in the decision penned by Mr. Justice Bengzon 
are not the only ones that induced us to vote for the denial of the petition. We 
are of opinion that there are substantive grounds upon which to base denial, and 
the corresponding legal question should be faced and decided squarely, because 
it has been squarely raised in the pleadings, it was the subject of extensive 
arguments by counsels, and upon it the members of this Court have thoroughly 
deliberated.</p>
<p>The filing of a certificate of candidacy is a technicality that should be 
enforced before the election, but can be disregarded after the electorate has 
made the choosing. This is only in accordance with the doctrine, laid down by 
the Supreme Court, to effect the provisions of the election laws, generally, are 
mandatory before the election and directory after. Here we are reiterating an 
opinion expressed in another case the decision of which is pending promulgation 
weeks ago. If respondent Monsale has garnered the majority of the votes cast for 
Mayor of Miagao, notwithstanding the fact that he has withdrawn his certificate 
of candidacy, withdrawal that he withdrew two days before the election, the 
electors completely disregarding what has been done about said certificate of 
candidacy, it will necessary much more than whole system of political philosophy 
to convince us not to give effect to the will of the people. The solemn 
declaration in the fundamental law that sovereignty resides in the people would, 
otherwise, be whimsical. </p>
<p>No pretense is made that, besides the disputed effects of a withdrawn 
withdrawal of a certificate of candidacy, any Evil has resulted by the shifting 
attitude of a candidate in regards to the orderly holding of suffrage, on any 
sector of public interest. Without putting in issue the legislative wisdom 
regarding the filing of a certificate of candidacy, there is no way of brushing 
aside the universal conviction to the effect that election legal provisions are 
enacted, never to stifle or defeat the popular will, but give it the freest 
sway, as an indispensable factor in the existence, functioning and preservation 
of democracy.</p></div>
