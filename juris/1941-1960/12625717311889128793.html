				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This Action, Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 1642, Was Commenced By The Province Of Ilocos Norte In The Court&nbsp; Of First Instance Of That Province,&nbsp; Under The Provisions Of Sections 2106-(<i>f</i>) Of The Revised Administrative Code And Rule 69.Of The Rules Of Court, To&nbsp; Expropriate Lot No. 2191 Of The Laoag Cadastral Survey Covered By Transfer Certificate Of Title No. 769, Office Of The Register Of Deeds Of Ilocos Norte, Consisting Of 2,214 Square Meters And A Camarin Of Strong; Materials And A&nbsp; Brick Fence, Belonging To&nbsp; The Defendant Compañia&nbsp; General De Tabacos De Filipinas&nbsp; (Later To Be Referred To As Tabacalera).&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff Intends To Use Defendant's&nbsp; Property For The Construction Of, An&nbsp; Office Building To Be Occupied By&nbsp; The Office Of The District&nbsp; Engineer Of Plaintiff and The&nbsp; Personnel Of Said Office'; For The Construction Of A Motor Pool Yard; For The Construction Of A Bodega And Storerooms;&nbsp; For&nbsp; The Establishment Of A Garage For A Plaintiff's Motor&nbsp; Vehicles And&nbsp; For The Establishment Of A Mechanic's Shop."&nbsp; (Defendant's Brief As&nbsp; Appellant, Page 2).&nbsp; Plaintiff Was&nbsp; Duly Authorized By&nbsp; The&nbsp; Office Of The President To Institute These Condemnation Proceedings.<br><br>Tabacalera&nbsp; In&nbsp; A&nbsp; Motion&nbsp; To&nbsp; Dismiss, Objected&nbsp; To The Expropriation,&nbsp; Alleging That&nbsp; In Its&nbsp; Tobacco Business,&nbsp; It Needed And Had Been Using The Property,&nbsp; Presumably For Storage Purposes, While The Plaintiff&nbsp; Had No Real Or Compelling Necessity&nbsp; For The.Use Of Said Property,1 Because&nbsp; It Still Had Enough Space Within The Compound Of&nbsp; The Capitol Building Within Which To Build An Office For The Use&nbsp; Of The Personnel Of The Engineer's Office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant Also Claimed That In&nbsp; Case&nbsp; The&nbsp; Property&nbsp; Was&nbsp; Expropriated, Being&nbsp; A Sociedad Anonima Organized Under&nbsp; The Code Of Commerce Of Spain Of 1829, It Would Not&nbsp; Be Able Under The Law&nbsp; To Acquire Any&nbsp; Other&nbsp; Property In&nbsp; Substitution Thereof And Would Find&nbsp; Itself Completely Unable To Continue Its Business In Ilocos Norte And Will Thereby Suffer Damages And Losses Amounting&nbsp; To Not Less Than&nbsp; P100,000.<br><br>On&nbsp; Plaintiff's Motion, It Was Placed In&nbsp; Possession Of The Property On October 23,1952.&nbsp; Acting Upon The Motion To Dismiss The Complaint&nbsp; Filed&nbsp; By Tabacalera, The Trial Court&nbsp; Issued An Order Dated January 26, 1953,&nbsp; Wherein&nbsp; It Held That Plaintiff Had A "Lawful Right To Take And Expropriate The&nbsp; Property Described In The&nbsp; Complaint Upon The Payment Of Just&nbsp; Compensation."&nbsp; In The Same Order The Trial Court&nbsp; Appointed Three Commissioners To Ascertain And Report To&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court On The&nbsp; Just&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; For The Property Sought To&nbsp; Be&nbsp; Taken.<br><br>Extensive Evidence Was&nbsp; Presented By Both Plaintiff And Defendant Before The Commissioners, The Latter Even Making An&nbsp; Ocular&nbsp; Inspection Of The&nbsp; Property In Question. In&nbsp; A . Unanimous Report Signed By The Three Commissioners Dated May Is, 1953, They Found&nbsp; And Fixed The&nbsp; Value&nbsp; Of The Land To Be P13,284, That Is, At The Rate Of P6 Per Square , Meter And&nbsp; The&nbsp; Value Of The Camarin And The Brick.Fence To Be P11.520&nbsp; Or A Total&nbsp; Of P24,804.&nbsp; Both Parties Filed Objections To Said Report, And Considering Said&nbsp; Objections, the Court In A Decision Dated August 18, 1953, Reduced The Price Of P6 Found By The Commissioners Per Square Meter To P5, Thereby Reducing The Value Of The Jand&nbsp; To P11,070. The Trial Court Fixed The Value Of The Eamarin, At P10.425.46 On&nbsp; The Basis&nbsp; Of&nbsp; The&nbsp; Estimate Of&nbsp; Salvage&nbsp; Value&nbsp; Made&nbsp; By Nemesio Petel And Pedro&nbsp; Braceros, Construction&nbsp; Foremen, Exhibit "O",&nbsp; And The Value Of The Brick Fence At P500 Or P10,925.46 For The Eamarin And The Fence, Or A Total Of P21.995.46 For. The Whole Property.&nbsp; Both Parties Appealed From That&nbsp; Decision.<br><br>In The Appeal,&nbsp; Plaintiff Claims That On The Basis Of The Tax Declarations&nbsp; Of The Property In Question, Which Under Commonwealth Act No. 530 Should Be Considered In Fixing The Value Of Properties For Purposes Of Expropriation, The Values Fixed By Both The Commissioners And The Court Were Too High; Tabacalera On The Other Hand, Contends That&nbsp; Its Property Has&nbsp; Much-More Value&nbsp; Than&nbsp; That&nbsp; Fixed&nbsp; By&nbsp; The Commissioners And The Court And&nbsp; Cited&nbsp; As&nbsp; Part Of&nbsp; Its Evidence A&nbsp; Supposed Offer To&nbsp; Buy The Same Property Made By The St. William's College In The Year 1948 For The Sum Of P40,000.&nbsp; It Also Claims That&nbsp; The Plaintiff Was Not Duly Authorized&nbsp; To&nbsp; Institute Or At Least To&nbsp; Continue&nbsp; With&nbsp; The Condemnation&nbsp; Proceeding's For The Reason That The Authority Given To It By The Office Of The President&nbsp; Was Subsequently Withdrawn; And That Furthermore, Assuming That Plaintiff Was Duly Authorized To&nbsp; Expropriate, There Was&nbsp; No Real Necessity For The Expropriation.<br><br>We Are inclined To Agree With&nbsp; The Plaintiff In Its Contention That Defendant Should Not Now Question The AuthorIty Of Plaintiff To Expropriate Nor The Necessity Therefor For The Reason That Defendant Failed To Appeal From&nbsp; The Order Of January 28, 1953.&nbsp; According To Its Notice&nbsp; Of Appeal, It Was Appealing From The&nbsp; Judgment Of August 18, 195S And The Order Of October 15, 1953,&nbsp; Denying Its&nbsp; Motion To Set. aside&nbsp; The Judgment And For New Trial.&nbsp; It&nbsp; Said Nothing About The Order&nbsp; Of January 26, 1953,&nbsp; Wherein As Already Stated, The Trial&nbsp; Court&nbsp; Found&nbsp; And Held That&nbsp; The Plaintiff Was&nbsp; Duly&nbsp; Authorized&nbsp; To&nbsp; Institute And Continue With&nbsp; The Condemnation Proceedings&nbsp; And&nbsp; That There&nbsp; Was Necessity For Expropriation.&nbsp; But Even Assuming That Defendant Under Liberal&nbsp; Interpretation,&nbsp; May Yet&nbsp; Raise&nbsp; This Question Of Authority And Necessity For&nbsp; Expropriation, We Agree With The Trial Court That Although The Office Of The President By Reason Of The&nbsp; Protest Filed With&nbsp; It By Tabacalera, Requested The Plaintiff To Suspend The Condemnation , Proceedings&nbsp; Until&nbsp; The&nbsp; Protest&nbsp; Was&nbsp; Finally&nbsp; Decided, Nevertheless, Later When The Office&nbsp; Of The President Found&nbsp; That The Proceedings Were Too Far Advanced, It Practically Withdrew Its Request&nbsp; For Suspension And Even Informed&nbsp; The Tabacalera That It Felt That It Could No Longer Intervene , In The&nbsp; Proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; "A",&nbsp; Page 230,&nbsp; Defendant's Record On Appeal.)<br><br>Now&nbsp; As To&nbsp; The&nbsp; Necessity&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; The&nbsp; Expropriation,&nbsp; We Reproduce With&nbsp; Favor&nbsp; The&nbsp; Pertinent&nbsp; Portion Of The Order of The Trial Court&nbsp; Of January 26,-1953, To Wit:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; Secretary Of The Provincial Board Testified That The&nbsp; Office Of The District ,Engineer Needs Expansion.&nbsp; Engineer Aurelio Coloma Testified That There Are Twenty&nbsp; (20) Employees Of The Office Of The District&nbsp; Engineer&nbsp; Who Cannot&nbsp; Be&nbsp; Accommodated In The Present Building Of The Said&nbsp; Office.; That&nbsp; The&nbsp; Said Office Owns Four (4) Automobiles; Two Jeeps, Twenty (20)&nbsp; Trucks,&nbsp; Cranes, Road Rollers And&nbsp; Other&nbsp; Heavy&nbsp; Equipments&nbsp; And The&nbsp; Said&nbsp; Motor&nbsp; Vehicles&nbsp; Have No Parking Place In&nbsp; The Present Office Of The&nbsp; Office Of The District Engineer, So That They Have To&nbsp; Be&nbsp; Parked&nbsp; In&nbsp; The Streets;'&nbsp; That The Office Of The District Engineer Contemplates Building Mechanic&nbsp; Shop$ And&nbsp; Repair Shops For&nbsp; Its R Many&nbsp;&nbsp; Motor&nbsp; Vehicles&nbsp; And Equipment; That There Are So Many Equipment And Materials Belonging To The District Engineer's Office Which&nbsp; Cannot Be Accomodated In Its Present Site, Hence, The&nbsp; Said Engineer's Office Has To&nbsp; Lease Private Lots To Accommodate Those Shops And Motor Vehicles."<br>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"Counsel For Defendant&nbsp; Contends That&nbsp; Plaintiff's&nbsp; Own&nbsp; Evidence Positively Show That It Has Enough Ground Upon Which To Construct Buildings, To House All Its Centralized Offices And He Cites The Testimony Of Engineer Aurelio&nbsp; Coloma To The Effect That There Is Sufficient Space Behind The&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Capitol Building&nbsp; On Which&nbsp; Additional. Office&nbsp; Buildings Can He&nbsp; Constructed; That If&nbsp; The Semi-Permanent office&nbsp; Buildings Now Existing Behind The Provincial&nbsp; Capitol&nbsp; Were Improved And&nbsp; Additional Floors Were Constructed And Added To The Existing Buildings, The Same Would Be&nbsp; Enough To House&nbsp; All The. Centralized&nbsp; Offices Of The Provincial Government Of Ilacos Norte. But Mr. Coloma Continuing1 His Answer To&nbsp; The Question Of he Counsel Said: "For&nbsp; Office Personnel,&nbsp; The&nbsp; Building That May Be Constructed Behind The&nbsp; Provincial Capitol may be able&nbsp; To Accommodate All The Personnel Of&nbsp; The Provincial&nbsp; Government.&nbsp; But Fop The&nbsp; Building necessary For&nbsp; Repairshops, Bodegas And&nbsp; Storage&nbsp; Buildings,&nbsp; That Would not be enough.'&nbsp;&nbsp; (P. 37, t. s. n.),"<br></blockquote>In this Connection,&nbsp; Plaintiff Correctly Said The Following:<br><blockquote>"In Addition&nbsp; To the observation of The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; Stated In The Foregoing: Order, May we Add That It Would&nbsp; Not&nbsp; Be Pleasant To Crowd Office Buildings, Mechanic Shops, Repair Shops, Bodegas And Garages In The Same Compound.&nbsp; The Noise&nbsp; Created By&nbsp; The, Mechanic Shops And Repair&nbsp; .Shops Alone Would Be Sufficient To&nbsp; Disturb&nbsp; The Entire Office Personnel In The Provincial Capitol.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greatest Inconvenience Would Be Caused To&nbsp; The office of&nbsp; The. Provincial Fiscal Which Heeds An Atmosphere of calm And Quiet&nbsp; To Properly&nbsp; Perform Its Duties Of Study And Research.&nbsp; The Noise&nbsp; Would Also&nbsp; Disturb Conferences ', And Sessions Of&nbsp; The Provincial Board."<br></blockquote>And It Cites The Following Authority—<br><blockquote>Necessity does&nbsp; Not Mean An Absolute But&nbsp; Only&nbsp; A Reasonable Necessity,&nbsp; Such As Would Combine The&nbsp; Greatest&nbsp; Benefit To The Public&nbsp; With The Least Inconvenience And Expense To The Condemning: Party And Property Owner&nbsp; Consistent&nbsp; With&nbsp; Such Benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp; (20 Corpus Juris,' 630-632; City&nbsp; Of Manila <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Arellano Law College, 85&nbsp; Phil,, 663.)<br></blockquote>We Agree&nbsp; With The Trial Court&nbsp;&nbsp; And The&nbsp; Plaintiff&nbsp; That The Province&nbsp; Of Ilocos Norte Really&nbsp; Needs The Property&nbsp; In Question And So We&nbsp; Hold That Expropriation Is Justified.<br><br>To Us The More Important Question Involved Is The Fixing Of The Value Of The Property,&nbsp; Specially Of The Land.&nbsp; We Cannot Agree With The Plaintiff That Under Commonwealth Act 530, The&nbsp; Value Of The Property To Be Condemned Should Be Based Exclusively On Those Stated&nbsp; In The Tax Declarations. The&nbsp; Very Act Invoked Says That The&nbsp; Statement Of The Value of The Property Made By The Owner In The Tax Declaration .&nbsp; Shall Constitute, A <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie&nbsp;</span> Evidence Of The Real Value Of The Property In Expropriation Proceedings By The Government And&nbsp; Its Instrumentalities.&nbsp; In&nbsp; Other Words, It Is not Conclusive&nbsp; Evidence.&nbsp; We&nbsp; Have&nbsp; Examined&nbsp; The&nbsp; Numerous Deeds Of Sale Presented By Both Parties Intended To&nbsp; Prove The Value Of Land Near And Around The Property In Question. Much Of Said Evidence We Found To Be Unsatisfactory,&nbsp; Either Because The Sales Therein Mentioned Were Made Long Before The Expropriation,&nbsp; Especially When We Consider The&nbsp; Trend Of Increase In Real Estate Values During The Last Few Years; Also, Because In Many Of Those Deeds&nbsp; Of Sale,&nbsp; There&nbsp; Were Improvements On&nbsp; The Land Such&nbsp; As Buildings,&nbsp; And&nbsp; It Is Difficult, If&nbsp; Not Impossible To Fix&nbsp; The Values Or Prices Of The Land And The&nbsp; Improvements&nbsp; Thereon Separately.&nbsp;&nbsp; But We Find That The Deeds Of Sale Shown By Plaintiff's Exhibits "X",&nbsp; "Z",&nbsp; And "Aa" And The Deeds&nbsp; Of Sale, Defendant's Exhibits "13"&nbsp; And "15", As Tabulated By Us To.Show The Dates Of Sale, Price Per&nbsp; Square Meter&nbsp; And Registration Or Non-Registration Of&nbsp; The&nbsp; Parcels Sold,&nbsp; Are Quite Pertinent And Helpful.<br><br><table align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td>Exhibit&nbsp; "X"— May&nbsp; 12, 1952 ............&nbsp; P6.98&nbsp; —Not Registered</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit&nbsp; "Z"— May&nbsp; 12, 1952 .............&nbsp; P7.19&nbsp; —Registered</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit "AA"— July&nbsp; 6, 1849&nbsp; ..............&nbsp; P6.84&nbsp; —Registered</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit&nbsp; "13"— May 19,&nbsp; 1949 ..............&nbsp; P9.31&nbsp; —Not Registered</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exhibit&nbsp; "15"— November 11, 1937 ... P10.905—Not Registered</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>On The Basis Of&nbsp; These&nbsp; Five Exhibits, We Find&nbsp; The Average Price Per Square Meter To Be Around P7.92 Which We Fix In Round Numbers As F 8.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Addition To This Evidence, We Also Have The Location Of The Property And Its Proximity To The Capital As Shown&nbsp; By The Plan, Exhibit "F".&nbsp;&nbsp; It Is Right Next To The Capitol Building Or Compound, Separated From It Only By A&nbsp; Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, It Is On The Side Of The Capitol Building Compound And Not Behind It.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, The Property Is Registered Under The Torrens System And So Is Relatively More Valuable.<br><br>As Regards The Value Of The Improvements, We Are Satisfied With The Appraisal Made&nbsp; By The Three Commissioners. They Made Detailed Estimates Of The Different Portions Of Camarin Fixing Its&nbsp; Entire Value At P11.070 And The Brick Fence At P450 Or A Total Of P11,520.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Estimate Made By The two Foremen Aforementioned Which Was Accepted By The Court, Is Not Much Different,&nbsp; The Discrepancy Being Only About P1,000.&nbsp; In This Connection, We Note That The Trial Court In Accepting.The Estimate By The Two Foremen In The Amount Of P10.425.46, It Thought That It Referred Only To The Building Or Camarin And So Added To It The Amount Of P500 As The Value Of The&nbsp; Brick Fence,&nbsp; When In Reality The Estimate Of&nbsp; The&nbsp; Two&nbsp; Foremen&nbsp; Already&nbsp; Included&nbsp; The Brick Fence.<br><br>Besides The&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; For The Actual&nbsp; And Market Value Of The&nbsp; Property&nbsp; Appropriated,&nbsp; The Defendant Claims Consequential Damages, Saying That It Is Being Deprived Of Its Camarin Whichit Is Using In Its Business, And That For The Government To Deprive It Of Its Use, It Must Make Due Compensation For The&nbsp; Consequent Damage.&nbsp; According To The Evidence, However, The Defendant Has&nbsp; Other Camarins Of Equal Size And Capacity In Nearby&nbsp; Towns Of Iloeos Norte To Which It Could Send The Tobacco Bought By It For Packing Or Baling. Furthermore,&nbsp; It Is Not Entirely Correct To Say That The Defendant Had&nbsp; Always Been Using The Property And Badly Needs&nbsp; It In Its Business Because Several Times It Had Rented Said Property, Particularly The Camarin To Other Parties For Industrial Purposes And School Purposes; That At One Time, The&nbsp; Office&nbsp; Of The&nbsp; District Engineer Of Ilocos Norte&nbsp; Had Even Used Part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">camarin&nbsp;</span> As Sublessee; And That There Was A&nbsp; Time When The .Property Was Rented And Used As A Cinema Studio And&nbsp; Boxing Stadium.<br><br>In Conclusion, We Find And Hold That The Plaintiff Herein was Duly Authorized To Initiate And&nbsp; Prosecute These Condemnation Proceedings, And&nbsp; That The Condemnation Was Justified Because It Needed The Property In&nbsp; Question For Its Use. We&nbsp; Also Find And Fix The Fair Market Value Of The Land In Question At P17.712 And The&nbsp; Camarin And Fence At P11.520, Or A Total Of P29,232, Which Sum The Plaintiff Is Directed To Pay To The Defendant With Legal Interest From The Time&nbsp; That&nbsp; It Took Possession Of The Property.&nbsp; No Costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
