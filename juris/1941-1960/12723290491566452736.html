				G.R. No. L-4032, October 25, 1952</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF CHUA PIENG TO BE ADMITTED A CITIZEN OF THE PHILIPPINES. CHUA PIENG, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decree of the Court of First Instance 
of Rizal, Quezon City (Branch III) granting the petition of Chua Pieng to be 
admitted a citizen of the Philippines. The record discloses that Chua Pieng was 
born in Amoy, China, on June 18, 1909, and came for the first time to the 
Philippines on January 3, 1919. Since then ha has resided continuously in this 
country, except for four short visits to China. He studied in the Anglo-Chinese 
School in Manila, and speaks and writes both Tagalog and English. He has a 
perfumery business in Manila with a capital investment of P200.000 and owns a 
house and a lot and two other parcels of land in Quezon City. 
<p align="justify">By his first wife named Lee Siok Cheng he has six children, 
namely, Chua Siu Siu, 19 years old, enrolled in Amoy high school, China, in 
1942; Carlos Chua, 16 years old, enrolled at the Ateneo de Manila, Manila, in 
June, 1948; and Lily Chua, 10 years old, enrolled in the Chinese Republican 
School in June, 1946; Manuel Chua, 14 years old, enrolled in the Chinese 
Republican School, Manila, in June, 1946; Nelson Chua, 12 years old, enrolled in 
the Amoy Elementary Schol, Amoy, China, in June, 1948 and Lily Chua, 10 years 
old, enrolled in the Chinese Republican School, Manila. </p>
<p align="justify">Lee Siok Cheng died in June, 1945, and Chua Pieng was married 
for the second time to Go Ay Ty in February, 1950. No child has .as yet been 
born out of this union. Chua Pieng declared that he has never been convicted of 
any crime involving moral turpitude; that he is not suffering from any incurable 
or contagious disease; that he is neither a communist, nor a polygamist, nor a 
believer in the practice of polygamy. He further declared that he believes in 
the principles underlying the Constitution of the Philippines, and that he has 
associated or mingled socially with Filipinos. He presented two witnesses to 
corroborate his declaration as to his business and social activities in the 
Philippines, and both of them testified that they know of no impediment to the 
petition of Chua Pieng for citizenship. </p>
<p align="justify">The original petition of Chua Pieng was filed on March 29, 
1949. Prior to this petition he did not file his declaration of intention to 
become a citizen of the Philippines as required by section 5 of the Revised 
Naturalization Law. The Court of First Instance of Rizal found him fully 
qualified and granted his petition, and against this decision the Solicitor 
General has prosecuted this appeal, contending that Chua Pieng can not be 
admitted for naturalization for two reasons, namely, because he has not enrolled 
all his minor children of school age in the public schools of the Philippines or 
in the private schools thereof recognized by the Bureau of Private Education, 
and because he failed to file a declaration of intention to become a citizen of 
the Philippines, as required by section 5 of the Revised Naturalization Law, 
prior to filing his application. </p>
<p align="justify">With respect to the first objection raised by the Solicitor 
General, petitioner's counsel contends that petitioner's sons, Chua Siu Siu and 
Nelson Chua, could not return to the Philippines on account of the war in China 
and due to the lack of transportation facilities from Amoy to the Philippines. 
Counsel for petitioner has also presented a motion for new trial to admit as 
newly discovered evidence a letter (Annex B) of Dee Han King, father-in-law of 
petitioner, to the effect that the above two children of the petitioner died in 
China on December 5, 1949, and February 24, 1950, respectively.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no explanation given by the petitioner why his two 
children, Chua Siu Siu and Nelson Chua, have been in China. Their existence and 
stay in China have been disclosed by petitioner with reluctance, without any 
plausible reason or excuse. In the original application filed by petitioner with 
the Court of First Instance on March 29, 1949, no mention of the existence of 
these two children is made. In his statement before the National Board of 
Investigation on June 2, 1949, their names are also improperly omitted, the 
petitioner stating that he had only four children by his first wife (Exhibit 2). 
His explanation in court was that his lawyer told him that it was not necessary 
to mention in his application the two children that had resided in Amoy, China, 
but that later on he was told by his counsel that it was necessary to include 
them, so he filed an amended petition including their names. </p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner must have sent his two children, Chua Siu Siu 
and Nelson Chua, to China to study, because when they went there they were still 
of school age. Chua Siu Siu was in China since 1942, and Nelson Chua in June, 
1948. These children must have gone there prior to December, 1941. If petitioner 
sent them soon after the outbreak of the war, it must have been for the same 
purpose or with the same intention. The statement made in petitioners' brief 
that it was impossible for him to bring them back to the Philippines because of 
the war is not borne out by the evidence submitted. We can take judicial notice 
of the fact that after the surrender of Japan in 1945 some two or three years 
passed before China was occupied by the Communists. It was not impossible then 
for the petitioner to bring them back to the Philippines. From all these 
circumstances the least we can say is that petitioner has failed to prove 
satisfactorily that he had always desired to enroll all his children in the 
public or private schools in the Philippines. He has also enrolled two of his 
children in the Chinese Republican School in Manila, an exclusive Chinese 
school. From these we conclude that he has failed to comply with the requirement 
contained in paragraph 6, section 2, of the Revised Naturalization Law. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 2. Qualifications. * * *: </p>
<p align="justify">"Sixth. He must have enrolled his minor children of school age, 
in any of the public schools or private schools recognized by the Office of 
Private Education of the Philippines, where Philippine history, government and 
civics are taught or prescribed as part of the school curriculum, during the 
entire period of the residence in the Philippines required of him prior to the 
hearing of his petition for naturalization as Philippine citizen." 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">This Court, in the case of Hao Lian Chu vs. Republic of the 
Philippines, (87 Phil., 668; 48 Off. Gaz., 1780), held: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Paragraph 6, section 2 of the Revised Naturalization Law 
provides that the applicant for naturalization must have enrolled his minor 
children of school age in any of the public schools or private schools 
recognized by the office of Private Education of the Philippines, where 
Philippine history, government and civics are taught or prescribed as part of 
the school curriculum * * *. The trial judge declared that as petitioner could 
not enroll Magdalena in the Philippines, because she was absent and was not 
under parental care, the requirement of the law as to children's education may 
be deemed to have been substantially fulfilled. </p>
<p align="justify">"This court believes that such requirement is important. The 
legislator evidently holds that all the minor children of an applicant for 
citizenship must learn Philippine history, government and civics, inasmuch as 
upon naturalization of their father they <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> acquire the privilege of 
Philippine citizenship. To excuse the applicant from this requirement it must be 
shown that there was physical impossibility for him to bring Magdalena 
here—impossibility which has not been shown in this case." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">To the same effect is the decision of this court in the case of 
Tan Hi vs. Republic of the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> (G. R. No. L-3354, promulgated on 
January 25, 1951). The application of the petitioner must, therefore, be denied. 
Another ground for denying it is the fact that he has failed to file his 
declaration of intention to become a citizen of the Philippines, when he does 
not fail within the exemption provided by section 6 of the Revised 
Naturalization Law. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Persons exempt from requirement to make a declaration 
of intention</span>.—Persons born, in the Philippines and have received their primary 
and secondary education in public schools or those recognized by the Government 
and not limited to any race or nationality, and those who have resided 
continuously in the Philippines for a period of thirty years or more before 
filing their application, may be naturalized without having to make a 
declaration of intention upon complying with the other requirements of this Act. 
<span style="font-style: italic;">To such requirements shall be added that which establishes that the applicant 
has given primary and secondary education to all his children in the public 
schools or in private schools recognized by the Government and not limited to 
any race or nationality</span>. * * *" (Commonwealth Act No. 535, amending section 6 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 473; italics ours.) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The petition for new trial must also be denied. The subsequent 
death of petitioner's children at the time of the pendency of the proceedings 
for his naturalization can give no benefit nor serve purpose to the petitioner. The requirement of the law is that he must send all his children to the public 
schools or private schools in the Philippines which are recognized by the 
Government and which are not limited to any race or nationality. The petitioner 
undoubtedly failed to comply with this requirement while all his children were 
still living; the death of two of them, who were not in the Philippines, can not 
operate as an excuse for non-compliance with the requirements of the law. </p>
<p align="justify">The decree appealed from should be, as it hereby is, reversed, 
and the petition is dismissed, with costs against the petitioner-appellee.</p>
