				<H3>FLORENCIO  SENO,  PLAINTIFF AND  APPELLANT,  VS.  FAUSTO PESTOLANTE AND TELESFORO BARIMBAO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff brought  this action before the Court  of First Instance of Cebu to recover from defendant Fausto Pestolante  the sum of P600, plus interest, and  the  sum of P250 as attorneys' fees and, in default of payment thereof, to order the foreclosure of the chattel  mortgage executed by said  defendant covering personal properties valued  at P2,500. One Telesforo Barimbao was made party defendant for the reason that he is presently in possession of the the mortgage property and has refused to surrender the same to the  plaintiff. <br> <br>Defendant  Barimbao,  answering the complaint, stated that he refused to  surrender possession of the  mortgaged property because he has purchased it from his co-defendant as evidenced  by  a  deed  of  sale executed  before a notary public.  Defendant  on  the other hand,  filed a motion  to dismiss on the ground, among  others, that the court has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case, it  appearing  that the  action is only  to collect a  balance of P600 which  comes  under  the original  jurisdiction  of the  Justice of  the Peace  Court of  Oroquieta,  Misamis Occidental. <br> <br>On August 1, 1956, the court sustained the motion and dismissed the complaint without pronouncement as to costs. The reasons  on  which the  dismissal is  predicated  are: <br><blockquote>"A careful perusal of the  complaint discloses that the nature of this case is but a collection of the balance of P600 which defendants owe the plaintiff out of the original  debt of P1,900, and to  secure the  prompt and full payment of said principal obligation and  interest thereon,  a  deed of chattel mortgage in favor of the plaintiff was executed.  Later on, P950 was paid by defendant Fausto  Pestolante of said obligation leaving an  unpaid  balance  of P600.  The chattel mortgage was  executed in  the  municipality of Oroquieta, Misamis Occidental on February 17, 1954. The Justice of the Peace Court of Oroquieta, Misamis  Occidental is the proper court who has original and  exclusive jurisdiction to try this case.  Section 3, Rule 5 of the Rules  of Court invoked by plaintiff is not applicable  to the present case  for said  section refers  to foreclosure of mortgage on real property." </blockquote>From  the  order  of dismissal, plaintiff took the  case directly to  this Court  on the ground that  only questions  of law are  involved. <br><br>There is merit in  the appeal.  While   it  is true  that the purpose of the action is to recover the  sum of  P600, plus interest, which comes within the original jurisdiction of the justice of the  peace court,  it  is as  well true that the action involves the foreclosure of  the chattel mortgage executed  by defendant Fausto Pestolante to  secure the payment of his obligation, which mortgage covers personal properties  valued  at  more than P2,000.  Speaking  of foreclosure of a chattel mortgage, former Chief  Justice Moran says: "Of course a chattel mortgage may be  foreclosed judicially, following substantially the same procedure provided  in this Rule  (Rule 70, Rules of  Court).  * *  * When the mortgagor refuses to surrender possession of the mortgaged chattel <span style="font-style: italic;">an action  of judicial foreclosure necessarily arises, </span>or one  of replevin to secure  possession  as  a preliminary step to  the sale contemplated  in  Section 14 of Act No. 1508"  (Moran, Comments on the Rules  of Court, Vol. II,  1957 Ed., 250-251).  And in a similar  case, this Court said: "Where * * * the debtor refuses to  yield up  the property,  the  creditor  must  institute  an  action, <span style="font-style: italic;">either to effect a judicial foreclosure directly, </span>or to secure possession as  a  preliminary to the  sale  above quoted" (Bachrach Motor Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Summers, 43 Phil., 6).  (Italics supplied).<br><br>Plaintiff had to institute the  present action because, as alleged in the complaint,  one  Telesforo  Barimbao  has refused to surrender  the  possession  of  the  mortgaged chattel because he claims  to have  bought it from the mortgagor free from encumbrance by virtue of a document executed before a notary  public. And the action  has to be instituted before  the court  of first instance because the chattel is worth more than P2,000.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby set aside and the case is remanded  to the  trial court for further proceedings, with costs against appellee Fausto Pestolante. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
