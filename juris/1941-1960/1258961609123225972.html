				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Francisco&nbsp; Cidro, Anatolio Calubad and Guillermo Callos were accused with&nbsp; seven other&nbsp; persons of&nbsp; robbery with homicide&nbsp; before the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Albay. Trial was held against&nbsp; all the accused except Guillermo Callos who was then at large and Francisco Cidro. and Anatolio&nbsp; Calubad&nbsp; were found guilty as charged while the&nbsp; rest&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquitted for&nbsp; insufficiency&nbsp; of&nbsp; evidence. They were&nbsp; each&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; c<span style="font-style: italic;">adena perpetua</span>, to&nbsp; indemnify&nbsp; the heirs of&nbsp; the victims&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P6,000.00,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the costs.&nbsp; The two&nbsp; did&nbsp; not appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently,&nbsp; Guillermo Callos was apprehended and after&nbsp; trial was likewise found guilty&nbsp; of the crime charged and sentenced&nbsp; to&nbsp; suffer life imprisonment,&nbsp; to indemnify&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs of the victims&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P6,000.00 and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; His motion for reconsideration having&nbsp; been denied, he interposed the present appeal.<br><br>In&nbsp; evening&nbsp; of&nbsp; February 18,&nbsp; 1949, Segundina&nbsp; Bello, her daughter Adela, 11 years old, and two grandchildren, together with three other persons living with them, namely, Angeles&nbsp; Borromeo,&nbsp; Benedicto&nbsp; and&nbsp; Nemesio Albaniel, were&nbsp; asleep&nbsp; in their house at&nbsp; barrio Cangum,&nbsp; Malinao, Albay.&nbsp; Timoteo Camasis,&nbsp; husband&nbsp; of Segundina,&nbsp; was absent at the&nbsp; time.&nbsp; While thus asleep, they were awakened by voices&nbsp; greeting them&nbsp; and telling them that they were bringing some&nbsp; hemp. Segundina&nbsp; stood&nbsp; up&nbsp; and lighted a small kerosene lamp when a shot was heard from outside.&nbsp; At this moment, one of the intruders kicked open the door and entered the house and then and there began picking some articles&nbsp; that were spread around.&nbsp; Upon seeing Segundina, he&nbsp; fired at&nbsp; her&nbsp; causing her&nbsp; instant death.&nbsp; Then he began ransacking the&nbsp; house taking along rice, sardines, hemp, clothing, jewelry and&nbsp; cash&nbsp; amounting to P200.00.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; same occasion he fired at Benedicto and Nemesio Albaniel and Angeles Borromeo causing also their immediate death.&nbsp; All this&nbsp; time appellant remained at the door and received all the goods which his companion had taken and placed them inside a sack.<br><br>In&nbsp; the morning of the&nbsp; next&nbsp; day, February 19, while Sgt. Cristeto Banares of the Philippine constabulary was somewhere in Bantayan, Tabaco, waiting for&nbsp; a bus,&nbsp; he saw a group of persons, among them, appellant, Dominador Cidro, Francisco Cidro, Candano&nbsp; Canalita,&nbsp; Canaban and Calubad going towards barrio Ilawad, with their clothes wet.&nbsp; At about 10:00 o'clock that same morning,&nbsp; Banares and other PC operatives to whom the&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; was reported, were ordered to shadow them, whereupon Banares went to barrio Instancia,&nbsp; Malinao, and questioned Calubad who indicated a tamarind tree near which he had buried a can of salmon which formed part of the loot.&nbsp;&nbsp; On that occasion&nbsp; Banares&nbsp; saw appellant holding a rooster,&nbsp; but he disappeared the next day.&nbsp; His other companions were later arrested by&nbsp; Capt. Caringal&nbsp; and his men.&nbsp; Dr. Juan Pagtakhan,&nbsp; President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the 7th Sanitary Division&nbsp; of Albay, conducted the autopsy of the victims having found several bullet wounds which caused their death.<br><br>Appellant's defense is alibi.&nbsp; He did not&nbsp; take the witness stand.&nbsp;&nbsp; He sought to&nbsp; prove it merely by evidence aliunde.&nbsp; Thus, Antonio&nbsp; R. Lagos,&nbsp; a foreman of&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Works&nbsp; assigned&nbsp; in&nbsp; Lopez,&nbsp; Quezon, testified that&nbsp; appellant was employed in&nbsp; a&nbsp; project&nbsp; in that place&nbsp; where&nbsp; he worked&nbsp; intermittently&nbsp; from February 22, 1949 to March 31, 1950.&nbsp; Ciriaco Oas, a carpenter&nbsp; residing at Gumaca, Quezon,&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that&nbsp; he saw appellant arrive&nbsp; at that place on February&nbsp; 14, 1949 but began working only on February 22,&nbsp; 1949.&nbsp; Francisco Cidro, a&nbsp; fellow-convict&nbsp; of appellant, testified that the latter&nbsp; was&nbsp; not with them in&nbsp; the commission&nbsp; of the robbery&nbsp; because&nbsp; he&nbsp; and&nbsp; Calubad were the only ones who perpetrated&nbsp; it because of some grudge&nbsp; he&nbsp; (Cidro) had against&nbsp; the&nbsp; victims.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said&nbsp; that it was&nbsp; Calubad who ransacked the&nbsp; house and&nbsp; took the&nbsp; articles&nbsp; stolen.<br><br>The facts&nbsp; as above narrated&nbsp; find support in&nbsp; the testimony of several witnesses for&nbsp; the prosecution, namely, Adela&nbsp; Camasis,&nbsp; daughter of Segundina&nbsp; Bello,&nbsp; Cristeto Baiiares, a member of the Philippine constabulary, and Anatonio Calubad, a&nbsp; fellow-convict of appellant.&nbsp; Adela Camasis,&nbsp; 11 years old,&nbsp; was the&nbsp; only&nbsp; survivor of the massacre&nbsp; and&nbsp; saw&nbsp;&nbsp; how&nbsp; the robbery&nbsp; was committed. She said that while they were asleep some people called from outside saying&nbsp; that they had some&nbsp; hemp&nbsp; for sale and when her mother&nbsp; stood&nbsp; up and&nbsp; lighted a&nbsp; kerosene lamp someone&nbsp; entered the house armed&nbsp; with a&nbsp; gun and flashlight.&nbsp; Then&nbsp; several&nbsp; shots&nbsp; were heard hitting her mother and&nbsp; her three other companions.&nbsp; The armed men then&nbsp; took several articles and money and handed them over&nbsp; to&nbsp; appellant who was standing at&nbsp; the&nbsp; door.&nbsp; She was able to&nbsp; recognize appellant&nbsp; because of the flashlight carried by one of the robbers.<br><br>Ba√±ares on&nbsp; his part&nbsp; said that&nbsp; in&nbsp; the morning&nbsp; of February 19, 1949, while waiting for a bus, he saw appellant in company&nbsp; with his co-accused&nbsp; going&nbsp; towards barrio Ilawad, and when sometime in the afternoon&nbsp; he went to barrio Instancia to investigate,&nbsp; he saw appellant holding a rooster&nbsp; and when he looked for&nbsp; him the following day,&nbsp; he disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; Anatonio&nbsp; Calubad also testified that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon&nbsp; of February&nbsp; 18, 1949 he was invited by appellant and the&nbsp; other co-accused&nbsp; to commit the&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; in question and that in the course thereof&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; stood&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; door&nbsp; and&nbsp; received&nbsp; the loot from Francisco Cidro.<br><br>It thus&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; actually&nbsp; took part in&nbsp; the commission of the robbery.&nbsp; Indeed, he&nbsp; was clearly identified by two eyewitnesses as can be gleaned from the following comment of the trial&nbsp; court:&nbsp; "After a study and&nbsp; consideration of the testimony of the&nbsp; witnesses for&nbsp; the prosecution and&nbsp; the defense, the&nbsp; Court has arrived at the conclusion that Guillermo Callos&nbsp; was one of those who perpetrated the crime of robbery resulting to the killing of Segundina Bello, Angeles Borromeo, Benedicto&nbsp; Albaniel and&nbsp; Nemesio Albaniel.&nbsp; Callos&nbsp; was clearly identified by&nbsp; Adela Camasis,&nbsp; daughter of Segundina&nbsp; Bello.&nbsp; While the defense&nbsp; tried&nbsp; to&nbsp; insinuate that Adela&nbsp; Camasis was&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time of the&nbsp; commission of the robbery, of tender age, hence of doubtful credibility, nevertheless, the Court is fully convinced of her sincerity because&nbsp; of&nbsp; her identification of&nbsp; Callos&nbsp; due&nbsp; to the light of the flashlight&nbsp; which occasionally&nbsp; struck&nbsp; the&nbsp; face of said Callos."&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; can therefore be no&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; as to the guilt of appellant.<br><br>Much&nbsp; stress&nbsp; is&nbsp; laid on&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; incompetence of witness&nbsp; Adela Camasis who was only&nbsp; 11 years old,&nbsp; the defense&nbsp; claiming that she cannot be&nbsp; expected to narrate what she had seen because of her tender age.&nbsp; This contention is untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; rule is well-settled that unless a&nbsp; child's testimony&nbsp;&nbsp; is punctured&nbsp; with&nbsp; serious&nbsp; inconsistencies as to lead&nbsp; one to believe that he&nbsp; was coached, if&nbsp; he&nbsp; can&nbsp; perceive and make known his perception, he is considered a competent witness<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Such a situation does not here obtain,&nbsp; for,&nbsp; as&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court has observed, Adela&nbsp; showed that she was able to&nbsp; relate&nbsp; well her&nbsp; impression of what she had seen despite the rigid&nbsp; cross-examination she was&nbsp; subjected&nbsp; to&nbsp; by the defense.&nbsp; The trial court,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; did not err in giving credence to her testimony.<br><br>We find nothing improper for the trial court to consider in the decision the fact that appellant did not testify in his&nbsp; own behalf and&nbsp; that&nbsp; sensing apprehension&nbsp; he disappeared after the commission of the crime.&nbsp; While his failure to testify&nbsp; cannot be considered against him, it may however help&nbsp; in&nbsp; determining his guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The act imputed to&nbsp; him&nbsp; is so&nbsp; serious that&nbsp; places in the balance his very life and under such predicament common sense dictates that to testify in his behalf&nbsp; might at least help in advancing&nbsp; his defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he preferred to do the contrary undoubtedly in order not to betray himself.&nbsp; His flight subsequent to&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of the crime&nbsp; can leave&nbsp; no other&nbsp; impression&nbsp; than that he&nbsp; did it to avoid apprehension.&nbsp;&nbsp; As this Court has aptly said: "The wicked fleeth,&nbsp; even if no man pursueth, but the innocent is as bold as a lion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Wherefore, finding the decision appealed from&nbsp;
