				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This&nbsp; suit for mandatory injunction was instituted in the Court of First Instance of Cebu by the Cebu. United Enterprise to compel Jose Gallofin, as&nbsp; Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs, Cebu Port, to release and deliver to the plaintiff two imported shipments of 7,834 bales of over-issue newspapers purchased by&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter from&nbsp; the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; As ancillary relief during&nbsp; the pendency of the action,&nbsp; the plaintiff prayed for the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by&nbsp; the court after the plaintiff posted a bond in the amount of P60,000.00 in favor of&nbsp; the defendant.&nbsp; Thereafter, the goods&nbsp; were released to the&nbsp; plaintiff, it&nbsp; appearing&nbsp; further&nbsp; that the advance sales tax due on&nbsp; the same had been&nbsp; duly&nbsp; paid upon&nbsp; arrival of the merchandise at port. <br><br>The importation of the aforesaid shipments was made under and by virtue of an&nbsp; Import&nbsp; Control Commission License&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1225 issued by the defunct Import Control Commission.&nbsp; Under the terms of the license, the plaintiff could import, on a no-dollar&nbsp; remittance basis,&nbsp; over-issue newspapers up&nbsp; to the amount or value of $118,000.00. <br><br>The refusal of the&nbsp; defendant to deliver the&nbsp; imported items is premised on&nbsp; his contention that while the&nbsp; five bills of lading covering the two shipments of the over issue newspapers were all dated at Los Angeles, U.S.A. December&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1953, or one&nbsp; day before&nbsp; the expiration&nbsp; of the import license in question, the vessels M/S Ventura&nbsp; and M/S Bataan, carrying on&nbsp; board&nbsp; the said&nbsp; merchandise, actually&nbsp; left the ports of embarkation, Los&nbsp; Angeles,&nbsp; and San Francisco,&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 12 and January&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1954 respectively.&nbsp; Hence, according to the defendant, the importation must be considered as having been made without a valid&nbsp; import&nbsp; license,&nbsp; because under&nbsp; the&nbsp; regulations issued by&nbsp; the Central Bank and&nbsp; the Monetary&nbsp; Board, "all shipments that left the&nbsp; port of origin after June 30, 1953, and are covered by&nbsp; ICC licenses, may be&nbsp; released by the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Customs&nbsp; without the&nbsp; need of a Central Bank release certificate; provided&nbsp; they left the port of origin within the period of validity of the licenses".&nbsp; No Central Bank certificate for the release of the goods&nbsp; having been shown or&nbsp; presented to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter refused to make the delivery. <br><br>The lower court was thus confronted with the issue of determining whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; valid period of the license in question should be counted <span style="font-style: italic;">up </span>to the time when the&nbsp; vessels carrying the&nbsp; imported items<i> left the&nbsp; ports&nbsp; of origin</i> on January 12 and January 16, 1954, or when the corresponding bills&nbsp; of lading were dated, or December 17,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp; The court chose the latter date, and held:<br><blockquote>"IN VIEW THEREFORE, this Court pronounces judgment making the writ&nbsp; of preliminary mandatory injunction issued against defendant permanent, with orders for the cancellation of plaintiff's bond, this after whatever&nbsp; advance sales tax or any taxes, surcharges and so forth might be due on the goods shall have been paid, without costs."<br></blockquote>The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The question&nbsp; raised,&nbsp; however, being&nbsp; purely&nbsp; one of&nbsp; law,&nbsp; the appeal was certified to us pursuant to a resolution of said court dated July 19, 1957.&nbsp; The&nbsp; appeal has no merit. <br><br>The authority of the appellee to import was contained in the Import Control&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; License No.&nbsp; 17225, validated on June 18, 1953, and under Resolution&nbsp; 70 of the Commission (adopted March 27, 1952), the same had&nbsp; a six-month period&nbsp; of validity counted&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; said date of June 18, 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; This license states-,&nbsp; among other conditions, thatâ€”<br><blockquote>"Commodities&nbsp; covered by&nbsp; this license must&nbsp; be skipped&nbsp; from the country of origin before the expiry date of the license, and are subject to sec. 13 of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 650."<br></blockquote>Although Republic Act No. 650, creating the Import Control&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; expired on&nbsp; July 31,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; to be conceded that&nbsp; its duly executed acts can have valid effects even&nbsp; beyond the life span of said governmental agency. <br><br>What is important to&nbsp; consider&nbsp; only&nbsp; is the legal connotation&nbsp; of the word&nbsp; "shipped" as the term was&nbsp; used in the license.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; maintains that&nbsp; it is when&nbsp; the&nbsp; vessel leaves the port of embarkation, while plaintiff&nbsp; holds that it is&nbsp; the dates of the bills of lading, which&nbsp; are usually issued after the cargo is placed on board the vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp; That the date of the shipment is the&nbsp; date&nbsp; when the&nbsp; goods for dispatch are loaded on board the vessel, and not necessarily when the ship puts to&nbsp; sea, is&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; implied&nbsp; from our ruling in the case of U.S. Tobacco&nbsp; Corporation<i> vs.</i> Rufino Luna, et al., (87 Phil., 4), wherein we said: <br><blockquote>"By section 6 of Act No. 426, all&nbsp; goods including leaf tobacco have&nbsp; been placed under control.&nbsp; Petitioner's&nbsp; merchandise left the port of departure before the passage of that Act but arrived&nbsp; in Manila after its approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of enforcing&nbsp; or applying said Section 6, there can only be one date of importation.&nbsp; Which was the date?&nbsp; The date the goods were ordered&nbsp; the date they were put on board vessel, or&nbsp; the date they reached the port of&nbsp; destination? We are of the opinion&nbsp; that the date of&nbsp; importation is.&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of shipment and not the date of arrival in Manila."&nbsp; (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; issuance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; bill of&nbsp; lading,&nbsp; furthermore, presupposes or carries&nbsp; the&nbsp; presumption that the goods&nbsp; were delivered to the carrier for immediate shipment (13 C. J. S. sec.&nbsp; 123 (2). pp. 235, and cases cited therein).&nbsp; It does not&nbsp; appear here that&nbsp; the bill&nbsp; of lading specified any designated day on which the vessels were to lift anchor, nor&nbsp; was it shown that plaintiff&nbsp; had any knowledge that the vessels M/S Ventura and M/S Bataan&nbsp; were not to depart soon after he placed his&nbsp; cargo on board&nbsp; and the corresponding bills of lading issued to him.&nbsp; From this latter time, the goods, in contemplation of law, are deemed already in transit (New Civil Code, Arts. 1531 and 1736). <br><br>It should also be considered that it is entirely outside the shipper's hands to fix the dates of departure, route or arrival&nbsp; of&nbsp; a vessel&nbsp; (unless he&nbsp; charters the&nbsp; whole ship [see Art. 656, Code&nbsp; of Commerce]). <br><br>Defendant's reliance upon Central Bank regulations that the shipment licensed must have "left the port of origin within the period of&nbsp; validity of&nbsp; the license" is not maintainable in the present&nbsp; case, because the regulations came into effect only on July 1, 1953 already after&nbsp; issuance of the appellee's license and can not be "read into the same (see 49 Off. Gaz. No. 6, p. 2189). <br><br>The Solicitor General's&nbsp; contention&nbsp; that, assuming the six months are counted up to the date the imported goods were placed on board the vessels for shipment the period of validity had&nbsp; likewise already elapsed because, legally, six months mean 180 days, which in this case expired&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; now&nbsp; be&nbsp; entertained because&nbsp; the defendant-appellant, under paragraph&nbsp; 3 of his Answer to the "Complaint, expressly admitted that the date appearing on the bills of lading (December 17, 1953) as the date of loading on board the vessels " is one&nbsp; day before the expiration of the validity of the import license".&nbsp; What&nbsp; he only questioned in the court below is the legal connotation of the word "shipped" under the import license.<br><br>In the light of the&nbsp; resolution we&nbsp; have taken on the main issue, it becomes unnecessary&nbsp; for us to dwell further upon the other&nbsp; questions raised by the parties.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; should&nbsp; be dismissed&nbsp; and&nbsp; the judgment of the&nbsp; lower court affirmed.&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angela, Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
