				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is petition for certiorari and prohibition  filed by Gavino Conjurado and Jorgia Morales against respondents Judge  Modesto R. Ramolete  of  the Court of  First Instance of Surigao, and Assistant Provincial Fiscal Vedasto R. Niere of the same province.  The following facts pertinent  to the case are  not disputed.</p>
<p>On November  27,  1950, petitioners herein  were  accused of frustrated murder  in  the Justice  of the Peace Court (later referred to as  Peace Court) of Dapa, Surigao, in Criminal  Case No. 4388.   The corresponding warrant of arrest was issued and  sent to the Court of First Instance for  certification for service in another province. The district Judge  believing that  the crime charged in  the complaint  was  that of serious physical  injuries  instead of frustrated murder,  returned the warrant to  the  Peace Court,  without certification..  Thereafter,  the Chief  of Police of Dapa amended the charge from frustrated murder to serious physical injuries and another warrant was  issued by the Peace Court.   The warrant, however, was never served because the whereabouts of the petitioners-accused were unknown.  So, on April 4, 1951, the Chief of Police moved for the provisional dismissal of the case (Criminal Case No. 4388) which was granted on the same day.</p>
<p>On December 11, 1952, respondent  Fiscal revived the case  in  the  same Peace  Court by charging  petitioners with the crime of serious physical Injuries  in Criminal Case No. 4449, which was later amended on April 17, 1953.  Petitioners-accuse in said Criminal Case No. 4449 moved to quash the amended information on the ground that the Peace Court had no jurisdiction over their persons for the reason that the first stage of the  preliminary investigation had not been conducted by  the said  court.   Said . motion  to quash was  denied, the court holding that the first stage of the preliminary investigation conducted in Criminal Case No. 4388 which had been dismissed, served the same purpose.  Petitioners-accused brought an action for prohibition before  the Court of First Instance against the Justice of the Peace, Civil Case  No. 639.  In  a decision dated  February 15, 1954, Judge Francisco  Area held that when Criminal  Case No. 4388 iwas  dismissed, all  proceedings had therein  by the Justice of  the  Peace were erased and terminated;  consequently, the  first stage of the preliminary investigation conducted  in said case could not be applied  to  Criminal  Case  No.  4449, and there was need of another preliminary investigation, because Criminal Case No.  4449 was a new case.  Judge Area granted the  petition for prohibition and directed the Justice of the Peace to refrain from further taking cognizance of Criminal Case No. 4449 without conducting the first stage of the preliminary investigation.   He further held that after the first stage of the preliminary investigation was conducted and probable cause was found, respondent may issue the corresponding warrant of arrest against the accused therein, and "after the accused are arrested or have  filed their bond,  then and  only  then can  the  respondent (Justice of the Peace) proceed with the hearing of Criminal  Case  No. 4449 in his court."</p>
<p>On March 1, 1954, respondent Fiscal filed an  amended information in Criminal  Case  No. 4449 with the Peace Court charging petitioners with frustrated murder.  After conducting the first stage of the  preliminary investigation the Peace Court issued the corresponding warrant of arrest against the accused  and the latter filed bond  for their  provisional release.  The Peace Court proceeded to conduct the second stage  of the preliminary investigation but the accused  (petitioners herein),   after entering a plea of not  guilty waived their right to the preliminary investigation and the case was sent up to the Court of First Instance where  respondent-Fiscal filed  the  corresponding information for frustrated murder on April 28, 1954,  docketed as   Criminal   Case  No.   1575.  When arraigned in said  case  on January 31, 1955,  petitioners moved  to  quash  the information  on  several  grounds, among  them that  the court had  no jurisdiction  over  the case;  that the criminal  action had prescribed;  that  the Fiscal had committed grave abuse of discretion in amending the information  in  Criminal  Case No. 4449  charging frustrated murder; and because of double jeopardy.</p>
<p>In an order dated February  9,  1955, respondent Judge Ramolete found and held that there was no prescription for the reason that on the basis of the information, the crime committed was frustrated murder, the period of prescription of  which was 15 years; that it was perfectly proper for the Fiscalto  file the new information in  Criminal Case No. 4449 for the reason that in Criminal Case  No. 4388, the accused  were never  arrested  and no rights of theirs had been placed at  stake and so, as to them nothing happened  and the  situation stood as  if  no case at  all had been filed against them; that as to the amendment of the information,  under the authority  of  section 13,  Rule 106, of the Rules of Court, the information may be amended in substance or form, without leave of court, at any time before the defendant pleads; and as to the alleged lack of jurisdiction, the court acquired  said jurisdiction because the case was sent up to the Court of First Instance by the Justice of the Peace after he had conducted the first  stage of the preliminary investigation to justify his issuance  of the warrant  of  arrest and that after  being arrested  and  after entering a plea  of not  guilty,  they (petitioners) waived their right  to  the preliminary investigation.  Acting on a motion for reconsideration respondent  Judge  denied  the same in  an order  dated February 26, 1955.</p>
<p>The present petition  for certiorari and prohibition was brought in order to annul the orders  of  February 9 and 26, 1955,  and to set  aside the amended information filed by the respondent Fiscal on March 1, 1954, in Criminal Case No. 4449 of the  Peace Court and  the information filed on April 28, 1954, in Criminal Case No. 1575 of the Court of  First Instance of Surigao, "and to restrain the said  respondent Assistant Provincial  Fiscal from further harassing the herein petitioners with new  information."</p>
<p>Considering the proceedings before the Justice of the Peace Court of Dapa, Surigao, and in the Court  of First Instance of Surigao as above related, we see no irregularity or error,  much less,  abuse of  discretion on  the  part  of respondent  Judge or  respondent  Assistant  Provincial Fiscal.  In filing Criminal Case No.  4449 in the Justice of the Peace Court, there  was no  double jeopardy  as against petitioners for the reason that they were  never placed  in jeopardy in  the first case,  Criminal Case No. 4388, for the accused  therein were  never  arrested and arraigned.  For the  same reason respondent Fiscal was perfectly warranted in amending the information in  Criminal  Case No.  4449,  charging  frustrated  murder instead of  serious  physical injuries, having done so before  the accused pleaded.   (Rule 106, section 13, Rules of Court.) Respondent Judge  acquired jurisdiction over   Criminal Case No. 1575 of this Court, because the Fiscal filed  the corresponding-information  in  said  case  after   Criminal Case No. 4449 had been, elevated to  him and  to respondent Judge  by the Peace Court after the  latter had conducted the  first stage  of  the preliminary investigation against  the petitioners  and after the  latter  had waived their right to a  preliminary investigation.</p>
<p>In view  of the  foregoing,  the petition for  certiorari and prohibition is hereby denied, with  costs.</p>
