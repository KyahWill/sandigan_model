				<H3>MARCELINO B. FLORENTINO AND LOURDES T. ZANDUETA, PETITIONERS  AND APPELLANTS, VS.  PHILIPPINE  NATIONAL BANK, RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>JUGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioners&nbsp; and appellants filed with the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; La&nbsp; Union&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; mandamus against&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; and appellee,&nbsp; Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; to&nbsp; compel it to accept&nbsp; the backpay certificate of petitioner&nbsp; Marcelino&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Florentino&nbsp; issued&nbsp; to him by the Republic of the Philippines,&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay an indebtedness to the Philippine National Bank in the sum of&nbsp; P6,800&nbsp; secured by a&nbsp; real&nbsp; estate mortgage on&nbsp; certain properties.<br><br>The case&nbsp; was&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; on&nbsp; an agreed&nbsp; statement of facts, which reads as follows:<br><br>"Parties herein represented by&nbsp; counsel, have agreed on the following facts:<br><blockquote>"1. That&nbsp; the petitioners are indebted to the&nbsp; respondent bank in the amount of P6,800 plus interest, the same having been incurred on January&nbsp; 2, 1953, which is due&nbsp; on January 2,&nbsp; 1954;<br><br>"2. That&nbsp; the said loan is secured by a mortgage of real&nbsp; properties ;<br><br>"3. That&nbsp; the petitioner Marcelino B. Florentino is&nbsp; a&nbsp; holder of Backpay Acknowledgment No- 1721&nbsp; dated October&nbsp; 6, 1954, in the amount of P22,896.33&nbsp; by virtue of&nbsp; Republic Act No, 897 approved on June&nbsp; 20, 1953;&nbsp; and<br><br>"4. That&nbsp; on December 27,&nbsp; 1953, petitioners offered to pay&nbsp; their loan&nbsp; with the respondent bank with their backpay certificate, but the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; bank,&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1953, refused to accept petitioners'&nbsp; offer to pay&nbsp; the said&nbsp; indebtedness with the&nbsp; latter's backpay certificate;<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; legal&nbsp; provision involved&nbsp; is section&nbsp; 2&nbsp; of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 897, which provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 2. Section&nbsp; two of the said&nbsp; Act&nbsp; (Republic Act&nbsp; 304)&nbsp; as amended&nbsp; by&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act Numbered&nbsp; Eight hundred,&nbsp; is further amended&nbsp; to read:<br><br>"Sec. 2. The Treasurer of the&nbsp; Philippines shall,&nbsp; upon application of all persons specified in section one hereof and&nbsp; within one&nbsp; year from the approval of this Act, and under such rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the Secretary&nbsp; of Finance,&nbsp; acknowledge " and&nbsp; file requests for the recognition&nbsp; of the right to&nbsp; the salaries or wages&nbsp; as&nbsp; provided in section one&nbsp; hereof,&nbsp; and notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; such acknowledgment shall be issued to the applicant which shall" state the total amount of such salaries or wages due the applicant, and certify that it shall be redeemed by the Government&nbsp; of the Philippines within ten&nbsp; years from the date of their&nbsp; issuance without interest; Provided,&nbsp; That upon application and subject to such rules and regulations 'as&nbsp; may be&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by the Secretary of Finance a certificate of indebtedness may be issued&nbsp; by the^ Treasurer of the Philippines covering' the .whole or a part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; total salaries&nbsp; or wages&nbsp; the&nbsp; right to which has&nbsp; been&nbsp; duly acknowledged&nbsp; and&nbsp; recognized, provided that the face value of such certificate of indebtedness shall&nbsp; not exceed the amount that&nbsp; the applicant may need for the payment&nbsp; of (1)&nbsp; obligations subsisting at&nbsp; the time of&nbsp; the approval&nbsp; of this&nbsp; amendatory Act&nbsp; for&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicant&nbsp; may directly be&nbsp; liable to the Government or to any of its&nbsp; branches&nbsp; or instrumentalities, ov the corporations&nbsp; owned or&nbsp; controlled by&nbsp; the Government, or to&nbsp; any citizen of the&nbsp; Philippines, or to any association or&nbsp; corporation organized under the&nbsp; laws of the Philippines, who may be willing to accept the same for such settlement."<br></blockquote>The question raised is whether the clause&nbsp; "who may be willing to accept the, same for settlement" refers to&nbsp; all antecedents&nbsp; "the&nbsp; Government, any of its branches or instrumentalities, the corporations owned&nbsp; or&nbsp; controlled&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; etc.,"&nbsp; or <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> the&nbsp; last antecedent "any citizen of the Philippines,&nbsp; or any association or corporation organized under&nbsp; the laws of the Philippines"<br><br>The&nbsp; contention of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent-appellee,&nbsp; Philippine National&nbsp; Bank is that said qualifying. clause&nbsp; refers to all the antecedents, whereas the&nbsp; appellants' contention ia that it refers only to&nbsp; the last&nbsp; antecedent.<br><br>Incidentally, it may be stated that one of the purposes of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 897 was to&nbsp; include veterans&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine Army&nbsp; and their wives, or orphans among&nbsp; the beneficiaries&nbsp; of the Backpay&nbsp; Law, Republic Act No. 304, in recognition&nbsp; of their great sacrifices in&nbsp; the&nbsp; resistance movement, as shown by the following quotation from&nbsp; the Congressional Record:<br><blockquote>"* * * This&nbsp; particular&nbsp; bill,&nbsp; House&nbsp; Bill&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1228,&nbsp; has&nbsp; been filed by this&nbsp; public servant&nbsp; for&nbsp; three objectives:&nbsp; First,&nbsp; to serve as a source of financial aid to needy veterans, like crippled or disabled veterans, and to their wives or orphans.&nbsp; Secondly, to give recognition to the sacrifices of those who joined the last war, and partioularly to those who have given their all for the&nbsp; cause of the last war.&nbsp; And thirdly, to eliminate&nbsp; the discrimination that has been committed either through oversight, or on purpose, against the members&nbsp; of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Scouts, and guerillas&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; so-called&nbsp; civilian&nbsp; volunteers,&nbsp; who&nbsp; joined&nbsp; the resistance&nbsp; movement".&nbsp; (Congressional&nbsp; Record&nbsp; No. 61,&nbsp; 2nd&nbsp; Congress, 4th Regular Session, May 6, 1958, page 74; quoted&nbsp; in Appellants' brief, pages 13-14.)<br></blockquote>Grammatically,&nbsp; the qualifying clause refers only to the last antecedent; that is, "any citizen of the Philippines or any association or corporation organized&nbsp; under&nbsp; the laws of the&nbsp; Philippines."&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be noted&nbsp; that&nbsp; there is a comma before the words or to any citizen, etc.," which separates&nbsp; said&nbsp; phrase from the preceding ones.<br><br>But&nbsp; even&nbsp; disregarding&nbsp; the&nbsp; grammatical&nbsp; construction, as done by the appellee, still there are cogent and powerful reasons why the qualifying clause should be limited to the last antecedent.&nbsp; In the first place,&nbsp; to make the acceptance of the backpay certificates obligatory upon any citizen, association, or corporation, which are not government entities or owned or controlled by the&nbsp; government,&nbsp; would render section 2 of Republic Act No. 897 unconstitutional, for it would amount&nbsp; to&nbsp; an impairment of the obligation of&nbsp; contracts by compelling private&nbsp; creditors to&nbsp; accept a sort of promissory note&nbsp; payable within&nbsp; ten years with interest at a rate very much lower than the&nbsp; current or even the legal&nbsp; one.<br><br>The other reason is found in the&nbsp; Congressional Record, which says:<br><blockquote>"Mr. Tible: On page&nbsp; 4, line&nbsp; 17, between the words 'this and 'act', insert the word 'amendatory'.<br><br>"Mr. Zosa: What is the purpose of the amendment?<br><br>"Mr.&nbsp; TlBLE: The&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of the amendment is to clarify the provision of section 2.&nbsp; I believe, gentleman from Cebu, that section 2, as amended in this amendatory bill permits&nbsp; the use of backpay certificates as payment for obligations&nbsp; and. indebtedness in favor of the government".&nbsp; (Congressional&nbsp; Record No.&nbsp; 64, 2nd&nbsp; Congress, 4th Regular Session, May 11, 1953, page 41; quoted in Appellants' brief, p. 15.)&nbsp; <br></blockquote>As there would&nbsp; have been no need to permit by law the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of backpay certificates in payment of debts to private persons,&nbsp; if&nbsp; they are&nbsp; willing to accept them, the permission necessarily&nbsp; refers to the Government of the Philippines, its agencies&nbsp; or other instrumentalities, etc.<br><br>Another reason is that it is&nbsp; matter of general knowledge that many officials and employees of the Philippine&nbsp; Government,&nbsp; who had served during the&nbsp; Japanese Occupation have already received their backpay certificates and used them for the&nbsp; payment of obligations to the Government and its entities for debts incurred before the approval of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 304.<br><br>The case of Diokno&nbsp; vs. Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance Corporation, '91&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 608&nbsp;&nbsp; (July&nbsp;&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1952),&nbsp; is&nbsp; different from the present one.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the1&nbsp; Diokno. case, his debt to the Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; Corporation was&nbsp; incurred on January 27,&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp; He brought the&nbsp; action on November 10, 1950, under the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 304 (section&nbsp; 2),' which was approved on June 18, 1948; that is, one year&nbsp; and almost eight months before Diokno incurred the debt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Diokno could&nbsp; not&nbsp; avail himself of the provisions of section 2 of Act No. 304, because said section provides&nbsp; that the application for recognition "of backpay, must have been filed within one year&nbsp; after the&nbsp; approval of said Act No. 304, and the debt must be subsisting at the&nbsp; time of&nbsp; said approval,&nbsp; Diokno&nbsp; having incurred the debt on January 27, 1950, and brought action on November&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1950.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was, therefore,&nbsp; discretionary&nbsp; in the Diokno ease&nbsp; for&nbsp; the Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; Corporation to accept or not his backpay certificate&nbsp; in&nbsp; payment. <br><br>The&nbsp; Secretary of Justice,&nbsp; in his Opinion No. 228, series of 1948, held that the phrase&nbsp; "who may be willing to accept the same for such settlement" qualifies only its immediate antecedent and does not apply to the Government or its&nbsp; agencies.<br><br>The appellee&nbsp; asserts in his brief that the Secretary of Justice, in his letter of June 19, 1953,&nbsp; remarked that the clause "who may&nbsp; be willing to accept such&nbsp; settlement" refers to all the antecedents,&nbsp; including the&nbsp; Government . and its agencies. We&nbsp; are not&nbsp; impressed with this observation of the Secretary, for we believe that his Opinion No. 226, series of 1948, is correct for the reasons we have stated above.<br><br>In the&nbsp; present case,&nbsp; Marcelino B. Florentino incurred his debt to the Philippine National Bank on&nbsp; January 2, 1953; hence, the&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; was&nbsp; subsisting&nbsp; when the Amendatory Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 897&nbsp; was approved.&nbsp; Consequently, the&nbsp; present case&nbsp; falls squarely&nbsp; under the provisions of section 2 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Amendatory Act No. 897.</span><br><br>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing, the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is reversed, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee is ordered&nbsp; to&nbsp; accept the backpay&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; above&nbsp;&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant, Marcelino B. Florentino, in payment of&nbsp; his above&nbsp; cited debt&nbsp; to the appellee, without interest from December 27, 1953, he date when&nbsp; he offered said&nbsp; backpay certificate in payment.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp;&nbsp; as to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
