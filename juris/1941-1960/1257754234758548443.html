				<H3>THE  COLLECTOR  OF  INTERNAL REVENUE,  PETITIONER  VS. DOMINGO DE  LARA, AS  ANCILLIARY ADMINISTRATOR  OF  THE ESTATE OF HUGO H. MILLER  (DECEASED), AND THE  COURT OF TAX APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These  are two  separate appeals,  one by the Collector of Internal Revenue, later on referred to as the Collector, and  the other by Domingo de Lara as Ancilliary Administrator of the estate of Hugo H. Miller, from the decision of the Court of Tax  Appeals of June  25, 1955, with the following dispositive  part:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondent's assessment for estate  and inheritance taxes upon the estate  of the decedent Hugo H. Miller is  hereby modified in accordance with  the computation attached as  Annex "A"  of this decision.  Petitioner  is  hereby ordered to pay respondent the amount  of  P2,047.22 representing estate taxes due,  together with the interests and other increments.   In  case of failure to pay the amount of P2,047.22 within thirty (30)  days from  the time this decision has become final, the 5 per cent surcharge and the corresponding interest  due thereon  shall be  paid  as part  of  the tax."</blockquote>The facts  in the case gathered  from  the  record and as found by the  Court of  Tax Appeals  may  be  briefly stated as follows:  Hugo H. Miller,  an American citizen, was born in Santa Cruz,  California,  U.S.A.,  in  1883. In 1905, he  came to the  Philippines. From 1906  to  1917, he was connected with the public school system, first  as a teacher  and later as a division superintendent of schools, later retiring under  the Osmeña Retirement  Act.  After his retirement,  Miller accepted  an  executive position in the  local  branch  of  Ginn &amp;  Co.,  book publishers with principal  offices in New York and  Boston, U.S.A., up  to the outbreak of the  Pacific War.  From 1922 up to December 7, 1941,  he  was stationed  in  the Philippines  as Oriental representative of Ginn  &amp; Co., covering  not only the Philippines, but also China and Japan.  His principal work was selling books specially written  for Philippine schools.   In  or about the year  1922, Miller  lived at the Manila Hotel.  His wife remained at their home in Ben-Lomond, Santa Cruz, California, but she used to come  to the Philippines for brief visits with Miller, staying three or four months.  Miller  also used  to visit   his wife  in California.  He never lived in  any residential  house  in the Philippines.  After the death of his wife in  1931, he transferred from the Manila Hotel to the Army and Navy Club, where he was staying at the outbreak of the Pacific War.  On January 17, 1941,  Miller  executed his last will and  testament in Santa  Cruz,  California, in which he declared that he was  "of Santa  Cruz, California".  On December 7, 1941, because of the Pacific War, the office of Ginn &amp; Co.  was closed, and Miller joined the Board  of Censors of the United  States Navy.  During  the war,  he was taken prisoner by the Japanese forces in Leyte, and in  January,  1944,  he  was transferred to  Catbalogan, Samar, where he  was  reported to have  been  executed by said forces on March 11, 1944, and since then, nothing has  been  heard from him.  At  the  time of  his  death  in 1944, Miller  owned  the following properties:<br><br><table style="text-align: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr align="center"><td style="text-align: left;" width="50%">"Real property situated in Ben-Lomond, Santa Cruz, California valued at................................</td><td width="50%">P5,000.00</td></tr><tr align="center"><td> <br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr align="center"><td style="text-align: left;">Real property situated in Burlingame, San Mateo, California valued at..........................................</td><td>16,200.00</td></tr><tr align="center"><td> <br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr align="center"><td style="text-align: left;">Tangible Personal Property, worth....................</td><td>2,140.00</td></tr><tr align="center"><td> <br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr align="center"><td style="text-align: left;">Cash in the banks in the United States................</td><td>21,178.20</td></tr><tr align="center"><td> <br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr align="center"><td style="text-align: left;">Accounts Receivable from various persons in the United States including notes.............................</td><td>36,062.74</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left;">Stocks in U.

Said court  subsequently issued an order  and decree  of settlement of final account and final distribution,  wherein  it found  that Miller was a "resident of the County of Santa Cruz, State of California" at the  time of his death in 1944.  Thereafter, ancilliary  proceedings were  filed  by the  executors of the will before the Court of First Instance of Manila, which court by order of November  21, 1946, admitted to probate the will of Miller as probated in the California court, and also found that Miller was a resident of Santa Cruz, California, at the time of his death.  On July 29, 1949,  the Bank of America,  National Trust and Savings Association of San Francisco, California, co-executor named in Miller's will,  filed an estate  and inheritance tax return  with the Collector,  covering only  the shares  of stock issued  by Philippine corporations, reporting  a liability  of  P269.43 for estate taxes  and P230.27 for inheritance taxes.  After due investigation,  the Collector assessed estate and inheritance taxes, which was  received  by the  said  executor on April 3, 1950.   The estate of Miller protested the assessment, but the Collector maintained his  stand and made the assessment of the  liability for estate and inheritance taxes,  including  penalties   and  other   increments   at P77,300.92, as of January 16, 1954.   This assessment was appealed  by De  Lara as  Ancilliary Administrator before the Board of Tax Appeals,  which appeal was later heard and decided by the Court of Tax Appeals.<br><br>In determining the "gross estate" of a  decedent, under Section 122 in relation to section 88 of our Tax Code, it is first necessary to  decide whether the  decedent was a resident or a non-resident of the Philippines at the time of his  death.  The Collector maintains  that  under the tax laws, residence and  domicile have different meanings; that tax laws on estate and inheritance taxes only mention resident and  non-resident,  and no reference whatsoever is made to domicile except in Section 93  (d) of  the  Tax Code;  that Miller during his  long stay in the Philippines had  acquired a "residence"  in this  country,  and was a resident thereof at the time of his death, and consequently,  his intangible personal properties situated here as well as in the United States were  subject  to said taxes.  The Ancilliary Administrator, however, equally maintains  that for estate and inheritance tax purposes,  the  term "residence" is synonymous with the term  domicile.<br><br>We  agree  with the Court of Tax Appeals that at the time that the  National Internal Revenue Code was  promulgated in 1939, the prevailing construction  given by the courts to the term "residence" was synonymous with domicile, and that the two were used interchangeably.  Cases were cited in support of  this view, particularly that of Velilla  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Posadas, 62  Phil.  624, wherein this Tribunal used the terms "residence" and "domicile" interchangeably and  without  distinction,  the case involving the application of the term residence employed in the inheritance tax law at the time (sections 1536-1548 of the Revised Administrative Code),  and  that consequently, it will be  presumed that in using the term  residence or resident in the  Tax Code of 1939,  the Legislature was giving it  the  meaning as construed and  interpreted by the Court.  Moreover, there is reason to believe that the Legislature adopted the American (Federal and  State) estate  and inheritance tax system (see  e.g. Report to the Tax  Commission of the Philippines, Vol. II,  pages 122-124, cited in I Dalupan, National Internal Revenue Code Annotated, p. 469-470).<br><br>In the  United States, for  estate tax  purposes, a resident is considered one  who  at the time of  his  death had  his domicile in the United  States, and in American jurisprudence,  for  purposes of estate and  inheritance  taxation, "residence" is interpreted as  synonymous with  domicile, and that—<br><blockquote>"The  incidence  of  estate and succession taxes has historically been determined by domicile  and  situs  and  not by the fact  of actual residence".  (Bowring  vs. Bowers, (1928)  24 F  2d 918, at 921, 6 AFTR 7498, cert, den  (1928) 272 U.S. 608).</blockquote>We also  agree with the Court  of  Tax Appeals that  at the time of his  death, Miller had his residence or domicile in Santa Cruz, California.  During his long  stay in  this country, Miller never acquired a house for residential purposes for he  stayed at  the Manila Hotel and later  on  at the Army and  Navy Club.  Except  for occasional visits, his wife never stayed in the Philippines. The bulk of  his savings and properties were in the United  States.  To  his home in California, he  had  been  sending souvenirs, such as carvings, curios  and other similar collections  from the Philippines and the Far East.  In November,  1940, Miller took out a property insurance policy  and indicated therein his address as Santa Cruz,  California, this  aside from the fact that Miller, as already stated, executed  his will in Santa Cruz,  California, wherein he stated  that he was "of Santa Cruz, California".  From  the foregoing,  it  is clear that as  a non-resident of the Philippines, the only properties of his estate subject to estate  and inheritance taxes are those shares of stock issued by Philippine corporations, valued at P51,906.45. It  is true, as stated by the Tax Court, that while  it may be the  general rule that personal property,  like shares  of stock in the Philippines, is taxable at the  domicile of the owner  (Miller) under the doctrine  of <span style="font-style: italic;">mobilia secuuntur persona</span>, nevertheless, when he during his life time,<br><blockquote>* * * "extended his activities with  respect to his intangibles, so as  to avail  himself of the  protection and benefits of the laws of the Philippines, in such  a way as  to bring his  person  or property within  the reach  of  the  Philippines,  the reason for a single place of taxation no  longer obtains-protection, benefit, and power over the subject matter are no longer confined to California, but also to the Philippines (Wells Fargo Bank &amp; Union Trust Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Collector (1940), 70 Phil. 325).   In the  instant case, the actual situs of the shares of stock is in the Philippines, the corporation being domiciled herein: and besides,  the right to vote the certificates at stockholders' meetings, the right to collect dividends, and the right to dispose of the shares including the transmission and acquisition  thereof  by succession, all enjoy the protection of the Philippines, so that the right to  collect the estate and inheritance taxes  cannot be questioned (Wells Fargo Bank &amp;  Union Trust Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.  Collector, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>).  It is recognized  that  the state may, consistently with due  process,  impose a tax upon transfer by death of shares of stock  in a domestic corporation owned by a decedent whose domicile was outside of the  state (Burnett<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>. Brooks, 288 U.S. 378; State Commission vs. Aldrich,  (1942)  316 U.S.  174,  86 L. Ed. 1358, 62 ALR 1008)." (Brief for the Petitioner, p.79-80).</blockquote>The  Ancilliary Administrator for  purposes of exemption invokes the  proviso in Section 122 of  the Tax Code, which  provides  as follows:<br><blockquote>* * * "<span style="font-style: italic;">And Provided,  however</span>, That  no tax  shall be  collected under this Title in respect  of intangible personal property (a) if the decedent at the time of his death was  a resident of a foreign country which at the time of his death did not impose a transfer tax or death tax of any character in respect of  intangible  personal property of citizens of the Philippines not residing in that  country, or  (b)  if  the laws of  the foreign country of which the  decedent was resident at the time of his death allow a similar exemption from  transfer taxes or death taxes of every character in respect of intangible personal property owned by citizens of the Philippines not residing in that foreign country."</blockquote>The Ancilliary Administrator  bases  his claim of exemption on (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)  the exemption of non-residents from the California inheritance taxes with  respect to  intangibles, and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) the  exemption by way  of reduction of P4,000 from the estates of non-residents, under the United States Federal  Estate Tax  Law.   Section  6  of the  California Inheritance Tax Act of 1935, now reenacted as Section 13851, California Revenue and Taxation Code, reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 6. The following exemption from the tax are hereby  allowed: </blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote>******</blockquote></div><blockquote>"(7) The tax imposed by  this act  in respect of  intangible personal  property shall not be payable  if decedent is  a  resident of a State or Territory of the United States or  a foreign  state or country which at  the time of his death imposed a  legacy, succession of death tax  in respect  of intangible  personal property within the State or  Territory or foreign state or country  of residents of the States or Territory  or foreign  state country, but  did  not impose a legacy or succession or a death tax or a death tax of any character in  respect of intangible personal property  within  the State  or Territory or foreign state or country  of residence of the decedent at the time of his death contained a  reciprocal  provision under which  non-residents were exempted from legacy or succession taxes or  death taxes of every character in respect of intangible personal property  providing the  State or Territory or foreign state or country of residence of  such non-residents  allowed a similar exemption to residents of the State, Territory  or foreign  state or country of residence of such decedent."</blockquote>Considering the State of California  as a  foreign  country in relation  to section  122 of Our  Tax  Code we  believe and  hold, as did  the Tax Court, that the Ancilliary Administrator  is entitled to exemption  from the inheritance tax on the intangible personal property found in the Philippines.  Incidentally,   this   exemption granted to non-residents under the provision of  Section  122 of our Tax Code, was to reduce the burden of multiple taxation, which otherwise would subject  a decedent's intangible personal property to the  inheritance tax, both  in  his place   of residence and domicile and the place where those properties are  found.   As regards  the exemption  or  reduction   of P4,000 based on  the reduction under  the Federal State Tax Law in the amount of $2,000, we agree with the Tax Court that the amount of $2,000 allowed under the Federal Estate Tax Law  is  in the  nature  of  deduction and not of an exemption.   Besides, as the Tax Court  observes—<br><blockquote>* *  * "this  exemption  is allowed  on all  gross estates  of non-residents  of the United States, who are not citizens thereof, irrespective of whether there is  a corresponding or similar exemption from  transfer or  death taxes of non-residents  of the  Philippines, who are  citizens of  the United  States; and thirdly, because this exemption is allowed on all gross estates of non-residents  irrespective of whether it involves tangible or intangible, real or personal property; so that for these  reasons petitioner  cannot  claim  a reciprocity." * * * </blockquote>Furthermore, in the Philippines, there is already a reduction on  the gross estate  for purposes  of the inheritance or  estate tax  in  the amount  of P3,000 under section 85 of the Tax Code, before  it  was amended,  which  in  part provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 85. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rates of estate tax.</span>-There shall be levied,  assessed, collected,  and paid upon  the transfer of the net estate  of  every decedent,  whether a resident  or  non- resident of the Philippines,  a tax equal to the sum  of the following percentages of the value of the net estate determined as provided in sections 88  and 89: <br><br>"One per centum of the amount by which the net estate exceeds three thousand pesos and does not exceed ten thousand pesos;" * * *</blockquote>It  will  be  noticed  from  the  dispositive  part of the appealed decision  of the Tax Court that the Ancilliary Administrator was ordered to pay the amount of P2,047.22, representing  estate taxes due, together with  interest and other  increments.   Said Ancilliary Administrator invokes the provisions of Republic Act No. 1253, which was passed for the  benefit of veterans, guerrillas or victims of Japanese  atrocities who died  during the  Japanese occupation. The provisions of  this Act could not  be invoked  during the hearing before  the Tax Court for the reason that said Republic Act  was approved  only on June 10,  1955.  We are satisfied  that inasmuch  as Miller not only  suffered deprivation of the  war, but was killed  by the Japanese military forces, his estate is entitled to the benefits of this Act.   Consequently, the interests and other  increments provided in the appealed judgment should  not be paid by his estate. <br><br>With  the above  modification,  the  appealed decision  of the Court of  Tax Appeals  is hereby affirmed.  We deem it  unnecessary to  pass upon the other points raised  in the appeal.   No costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A. Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia, </span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br></div>
