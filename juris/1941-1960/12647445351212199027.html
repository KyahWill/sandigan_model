				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of  Nueva  Vizcaya  denying appellant's petition for mandamus. <br><br>It appears that  appellant Manolo  L.  Maddela was, together with two policemen  of Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, accused of murder for having, while he was governor of that province, caused "the arrest and liquidation" of Juan Duran and Victoriano Jimenez, two young men suspected of having  given aid to the Huks in one of  their raids. The information was filed by  the  provincial fiscal; but a special  prosecutor from the Department of Justice later intervened and made a reinvestigation of the case,  taking down  the  testimony  of several  persons,  among them, Guillermo  Domingo, Paulino  Garingan  and  Hilario  S. Dawa, who were  listed as witnesses in the information. The testimony of these three confirmed the charge  that the arrest and liquidation of Juan Duran and Victoriano Jimenez had  been ordered  by Maddela  as governor  of the province.  But as the testimony of Guillermo Domingo revealed that the said  order was  transmitted  by him as chief of police of  Solano to his subordinates, counsel for  Maddela asked that Domingo be also prosecuted, and upon the request  being  denied he filed a formal petition for  a writ of mandamus to compel the prosecution to include Domingo in the information as one of the defendants and, with him, the other witnesses Paulino  Garingan and Hilario S. Dawa, it being alleged as to these two that  they had  concealed the fact that they heard Maddela give the  order  to  kill, and  that such  concealment  made them criminally liable  as  accessories after the  fact.     <br><br>Answering the petition, the prosecuting  officers claimed  that they did  not  find the evidence against Domingo, Garingan and  Dawa sufficient to  justify  their  inclusion in  the information as additional defendants,  explaining that  in the case  of Domingo, all that could be gathered from the evidence was that this man had merely transmitted to his subordinates  Governor Maddela's order "to arrest and liquidate" and that in so doing  he was acting under  the impulse of an uncontrollable fear, the fear of losing  his own life if the order was  not carried out.  And as to Garingan and Dawa, the prosecutors  explained  that  these two could not be  held criminally liable  for merely having  been present at  the  conference where  the  said order was given by  Maddela. <br><br>After trial,  the lower court sustained the prosecuting officers  and dismissed the petition for mandamus. From that decision Maddela appealed  directly to  this Court.<br><br>We find no compelling reason for disturbing the decision below.                                                       <br><br>In the case of Guiao vs. Figueroa, 94 Phil., 1018; 50 Off. Gaz., 4828, we said that the law makes  it the  duty of prosecuting officers  "to  file the  charges  against whomsoever the evidence  may show  to be responsible for an offense."  But we also there said that this does not mean that prosecuting officers shall have no discretion in the matter, for where the law demands that all persons who appear  responsible for an offense shall be charged in the information, it also  implies that those against whom no sufficient evidence of guilt exists are not to be included in the charge; and, needless to say,  the determination of whether or not there is,  as against any person, sufficient evidence  of  guilt to warrant  his prosecution necessarily involves the  exercise of discretion. <br><br>We cannot say that in the present case the prosecuting officers  have not made a legitimate  exercise  of that discretion. With respect to Guillermo Domingo, the evidence against him is found in his own admission that Maddela's order to liquidate Juan Duran and Victoriano Jimenez was transmitted by him to his subordinates. But the admission  is qualified with the explanation that he  had to transmit  the said order  to his subordinates for fear of being himself liquidated if he did not do so and that after the arrest of the victims "their subsequent liquidation was left to the discretion of Isauro Reverente and Sgt. Ambros." The prosecuting  officers  believed that explanation and so did the  trial court.  And it would appear that  Domingo's fear of mortal punishment was not groundless for we gather from  his testimony that, three or four days before, two of his policemen were put to death by the commandos of  Governor Maddela for disobeying  the latter's  order. In the  circumstances, we do  not think the prosecuting officers  could be charged with having  abused  their  discretion  in not  including  Domingo as  a defendant in the criminal case. <br><br>Much less is there evidence of guilt against the witnesses Paulino Garingan and Hilario  S. Dawa. It  is true that these  two admitted having been present at the conference where Maddela gave the  order  "to arrest and liquidate." But there is no showing that they  have done anything to conceal the crime that resulted from the implementation of that order to the extent of making them criminally liable as accessories after the fact. <br><br>We fail to see the abuse of discretion  attributed to the appellees. They appear  to have done their  duty as they saw it. At least it does not  appear that  in the exercise of their  discretion  as prosecuting officers they  have in this case failed to perform a duty which may be enforced through mandamus. <br><br>Wherefore, the decision apptealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
