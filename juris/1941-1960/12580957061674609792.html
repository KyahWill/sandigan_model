				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from the decision of the Davao court of first instance
annulling, on certiorari, the award made by the respondent Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources in connection with the sale of a
parcel of public land.<p></p>
<p>Known as Lot 7131-A Cad. 281 in the District of Guianga; City of
Davao, with an area of ten hectares more or less, the land was the
subject of Sales Application No. V-1138 of Socorro Ke. Ladrera. At the
ensuing public auction, Ladrera offered to pay P50.00 per hectare,
whereas Magdaleno Aportadera submitted a bid of P980.00 per hectare.
Making use of the privilege reserved for applicants, Ladrera equalled
Aportadera's bid, allegedly under protest, and the lot was awarded to
him. Subsequently, however, Ladrera addressed to the Director of Lands
a petition for the reduction of the price to his original bid of
P50.00, for the reason that P980.00 per hectare was exorbitant, unfair
and unreasonable. Acting on such petition, the Director relieved
Ladrera of his offer to equal Aportadera's bid of P980.00, rejected the
latter's bid for being excessive and unreasonable, and therefore
awarded the lot to Ladrera at P50.00 per hectare.</p>
<p>On appeal, the Secretary of the Department of Agricalture and
Natural Resources ruled that Aportadera's bid, being the highest,
should be accepted; that Ladrera may get the land if he equals
Aportadera's bid, and in the event of the former's inability or refusal
to do so, the lot will be awarded to the latter. Motions for
reconsideration failed.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  Ladrera filed this certiorari proceeding to annul the Department's  order on the ground of  abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>Basis of the action is plaintiff's assertion that the Secretary
"disregarded the basic policies and philosophies behind our Public Land
Law", that Aportadera's bid was "exorbitant, unfair, unreasonable and
excessive, considering the prices at which surrounding public lands had
been sold, and that Aportadera acted in bad faith because he took part
in the auction sale solely to prejudice the petitioner. Explaining his
second contention, plaintiff said the Appraisal Committee had appraised
the lot at P50.00 a hectare, and that all the surrounding public land
lots had been disposed at public auction at P50.00 a hectare.</p>
<p>In his answer, the Secretary maintained that considering the
condition of the land, the price offered by Aportadera was not
excessive, the price fixed by the Appraisal Committee being merely "the
basic price of the land upon which to start the auction of the same."
He said he only complied with the purpose of public bidding and the
law's directive of sale to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Aportadera, on the other hand, added other defenses such as laches
(complaint presented after about two years) and failure to exhaust
administrative remedies (no appeal to the President from the
Department's ruling).</p>
<p>Overruling these two procedural defenses, the judge upheld the
theory of the plaintiff. Discounting the Secretary's highest bidder
defense, His Honor premised his conclusion (that the Secretary abused
his discretion) on the idea that profit making is not the purpose of
the Government in disposing of public lands, and that it is rather the
policy of "giving land to the landless". In his own words,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * the fact that the law requires publicity in
the bidding of public land in order that the Government may get the
best price obtainable therefor gives the defendant Secretary the
semblance of a justification to reject the P50.00 per hectare bid of
the plaintiff Ladrera, despite the fact that ho was the applicant and
in possession of the public land in question, and to accept in lieu
thereof the higher bid of Aportadera on the basis of P980,00 per
hectare, whatever his motive might have been. It certainly would be to
the pecuniary advantage of the Government, who stands to profit at the
rate of P930.00 per hectare, or a total of P9,300.00, the area of the
land in question being ten (10) hectares.</p>
  <p>If profit-making
were the only guiding principle of the Government in the sale of public
lands, then the Government may just as well advertise itself as engaged
in real-estate business, and that in doing so, its primordial
objective, like those in private business of realty, is to make profit
for itself, without any thought of promoting and enhancing the people's
general welfare.</p>
  <p>But that is not the policy of the
Government. The disposable public land of this country is actually the
property of the people, and the Government is merely their trustee,
charged with the administration and disposal thereof in the best
interest of the people's collective and general Welfare, The state has
embarked and committed itself to the policy of giving "land to the
landless" in order to create a citizenry that is happy and contented. *
* *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the above were excerpts from a speech in Congress during
deliberations on a bill amending the Public Land Law, none would
probably object to the same. But in the face of positive statutory
provisions, it is impossible to agree to it at the present time. Land
for the under-privileged is provided by the Public Land Law in its
title on "Homestead". The poor may thereunder apply for 24 hectares <em>gratis</em>.
However, on the subject of sale, the law has decreed that public lands
shall be sold to the highest bidder (Sec. 24, Public Land Act) (Sec. 26
also). The Government is not thereby engaged in profit-making; it is
merely getting money in exchange for its property, money to be used for
the benefit of the people.</p>
<p>In the name of social justice, the court <em>a quo</em> would in effect deprive the public treasury of P9,300.00  (P9,800.00 less P500.00) to allow <em>one man</em>
to retain this parcel of land so that he may become a "happy and
contented" citizen. Yet, that same amount could and would be used by
the Government in other ways to make <em>hundreds of citizens</em>
happy and contented: e. g. for teachers in school barrios; for nurses
to attend the sick; for drilling of artesian wells, etc. etc. In this
alternative, the choice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is
not doubtful. And even if doubtful, the Secretary may not certainly be
held to have abused his discretion in choosing to benefit hundreds of
citizens instead of one. Anyway, if plaintiff <em>does not get  this land</em>, he may still apply for <em>other public  lands</em>.   It is written, "Look and you  shall find".</p>
<p>After finding that there was animosity between Ladrera and
Aportadera, that the latter had not submitted any bid for any of the
adjoining lots, and that Aportadera's bid of P980.00 per hectare was
about twenty times more than the bid for practically all the
surrounding lots, the lower court reached the conclusion that
Aportadera acted in bad faith, since he was not acting with the honest
intention <em>alone</em> of acquiring public lands for development  but mainly to harass <em>his enemy Ladrera</em> and prevent him, if possible, from acquiring  the land.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that at one time after the last war, Aportadera
occupied this lot (Exhibit F) (which was part of the bigger public land
leased to Pedro Monteverde), only to be defeated later by Ladrera when
the Government parceled out Monteverde's leased public land to
veterans, it is no wonder that when the lot was offered for sale, he
(Aportadera) bid for it, and not for other lots. It is certain, he knew
the conditions and values of the lot, and most probably he calculated
that even at P980.00 a hectare, he would still get a good bargain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>It may be true that  in  offering a  high price <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
Aportadera prejudiced-his enemy; but that should be immaterial to the
Department. In every public bidding, the winner "prejudices" the loser;
yet that is no reason to disqualify him; that in itself is not bad
faith; he is exercising his right to buy, and if the result prejudices
the losers, these may not complain; <em>damnum absque injuria</em>. In
deed, it would be highly incongruous for the Government to disqualify a
bidder precisely because he offered a high bid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"He  intended  merely  to prejudice me", argues plaintiff because at that price <em>any buyer  of the lot will lose</em>.
Well, if that be true, plaintiff should let Aportadera go ahead, pay
P980.00 a hectare and lose his money: let him fall headlong into the
pit he has dug for his adversary. Anyway, except for "losing face" in
the competition, Ladrera suffers no actual loss, because the
improvements he has made on the land will be paid to him, in accordance
with the order of the Secretary. To insist that the land should be sold
to him at P500.00 when the Government could very well get P9,800.00 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
is to demand that the Government give plaintiff a gift of P9,300.00 on
the plea of "social justice" or "land for the landless".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, then, because the Secretary has elected to abide by the law
expressly requiring the lot to be sold to the highest bidder; and
because he refused to sanction what otherwise would inflict a loss of
P9,300.00 to the Government; will the courts declare said official to
have abused his discretion, and to compel him to sell the lot at P50.00
per hectare? No, indeed. That would be requiring him to donate the
land, and to squander public money or property. He is authorized to <em>sell</em>; he is not authorized to  <em>donate</em>.
Knowingly to "sell" public property at one twentieth of its price is
not selling; it is "donating", and the courts will, if called upon to
do so, declare such "sale" to be invalid, because the officer, in
"donating", has exceeded his power to "sell".</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the appealed decision is reversed and the
complaint dismissed with costs against plaintiff-appellee. So ordered.</p>
<em>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,  Endencia, Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur.

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  In fact the land officers had no choice; the law directs that the land be sold to the highest bidder.
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> "Here is what the Secretary found about the value of the  land:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * in this particular case under review, this
Office has considered the fact that the land in question "was formerly
covered by the rejected Lease Application No. 2680 of Pedro Monteverde
which was involved in the so-called Japanese dummy land holdings. <em>Lands
so involved therein were among the beat that could be had in the
province of Davao or in the entire Philippine Archipelago for that
matter in point of abaca production.</em> Before the last Pacific war
and even during the early part of Japanese occupation, Japanese
interests had developed these lands so well that they were able to
produce the best abaca in this part of the world. The existence of a
big number of growing abaca plants on the land in question when
applicant Ladrera entered upon the same for the first time in 1947 was
proof enough of the high state of development and improvement of the
land. Now, judging from, such condition obtaining on the land coupled
with its easy accessibility to the facilities of transportation, this
Office has come to conclude that Aportadera's bid of P980.00 per
hectare <em>is reasonable and fair and  that Ladrera's  bid of P50.00 per hectare is extremely low</em>." (Italics ours.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  There  were  instances  where lots were  sold  by the  Government <em>at more than twenty times</em> the price fixed by the Appraisal Committee and/or the price paid for adjoining  lots:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In Kidapawan Townsite, Cotabato, a residential lot
duly appraised at P.50 sq. m. was sold at auction sale by the Bureau of
Lands at P20.00 per sq. m. and that lot of 1,000 sq. m. was sold to the
highest bidder for P20,000.00 while adjoining residential lots of the
same class were sold at only P500.00 for the lot of the same area,
1,000 square meters."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Unless such high bid
constitutes an indication that bidder does not intend to pay; or unless
the Government, knows he cannot pay.</p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Aportadera "is
genuinely interested in purchasing and having the litigated property"
as "the same will prove a gaining venture." (Brief for Appellant.)</p></div>
