				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila which dismissed, upon motion of the defendant, the action of the 
plaintiff to compel the former to deliver to the latter the owner's duplicate 
certificates of title of five parcels of land sold with <i>pacto de retro</i> by 
the defendant to the plaintiff "in order that the latter may surrender them for 
the registration and notation of the aforesaid contract of <i>pacto de retro</i> 
executed in his favor by the defendant herein."
<p align="justify">The ground upon which the order of dismissal is based is that 
the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the action, but what the plaintiff 
should do is to present the deed in the office of the Register of Deeds of 
Occidental Negros and if the defendant refuse to surrender his titles after due 
notice, the plaintiff should ask the Court of First Instance of Occidental 
Negros to require the defendant to produce said titles.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court did not commit any error in dismissing the 
plaintifff's complaint on said ground.</p>
<p align="justify">According to the allegations in the complaint, the predecessors 
in interest of the defendant could not deliver their duplicate certificates of 
title of the lands sold by them to the defendant on April 4, 1944, time of the 
sale, because they had lost them during the last war. The same parcels of land 
acquired by the defendant were on the same date sold with <i>pacto de retro</i> 
by him to the herein plaintiff. After liberation the defendant and appellee 
filed a petition with the Court for the reconstitution of the original of the 
abovementioned certificates of title, in order that the deed of sale in his 
favor could be registered. In compliance with an order of the Court of First 
Instance of Occidental Negros the plaintiff and appellant, on January 5, 1946, 
submitted to the Court the deed of sale under <i>pacto de retro</i> with lease, 
executed by the defendant in favor of the plaintiff and prayed that the said 
deed be registered and annotated on the certificates of titles that wauld be 
issued in the name of the defendant Santiago Granada. The Court issued an order 
for the reconstitution of the titles of the aforesaid parcels of land, and on 
May 15, 1946, the Register of Deeds of Occidental Negros issued the transfer 
certificates of title covering said parcels of land in the name of the defendant 
Granada, who received them on lay 17 of the same year, but refused to surrender 
said certificates to the Register of Deeds or deliver them to the plaintiff, and 
hence the filing of the plaintiff's action.</p>
<p align="justify">Attorneys for appellant contend that the plaintiff's action is 
to compel the defendant to deliver to the former the duplicate certificates of 
title issued in the latter's name in order that the plaintiff-vendee may 
register his interest in the land on those certificates issued in the name of 
the defendant-vendor. Because "a contract of <i>pacto de retro</i> sale is a 
voluntary deed of transfer which does not divest the land in fee simple from the 
owner. Hence, the interest of the <i>vendee a retro</i> in the land is less than 
an estate in fee simple. That being the case, according to section 52 of the 
Land Registration Law, no new certificate is entered or issued to the 
transferee, but his interest in the land is registered by filing with the 
Register of Deeds the instrument creating such interest and by memorandum 
thereof made by said Register of Deeds upon the certificate of title. "[Of the 
registered owner]."</p>
<p align="justify">This is obviously untenable. A sale with <i>pacto de retro</i> 
transfers the legal title to the vendee (Alderete vs. Amandoron, 46 Phil., 488), 
and the vendee is subrogated to all the rights and actions of the vendor (art. 
1511, Civil Code), and therefore the vendee is the owner of the estate in fee 
simple subject to the vendor's right of redemption. And he may mortgage the 
property or impose upon it any other charge, but if the vendor redeems it he 
(the vendor) is entitled to "received it free of any charge or mortgage imposed 
by the vendee, but he shall be obliged to respect any lease made by the latter 
in good faith and in accordance with the customs of the place where it is 
situated" (art. 1520, Civil Code). This contention of the attorney for appellant 
signing the brief runs counter to the opinion expressed by the same attorney in 
his book on Land Registration and Mortgages, page 90, to the effect that "the 
legal title is transferred to him (vendee), that is, he has the fee simple which 
is the registrable title in the initial registration, while the right to redeem 
the property retained by the vendor <i>a retro</i> should only be noted in the 
decree and certificate of title," or in the new certificate of title issued in 
the name of the vendee under sections 52 and 57 of the Land Registration Act No. 
496. This opinion is correct for the right to repurchase is a real right or 
interest therein which may be registered as an interest less than an estate in 
fee simple under section 52 of the same Act No. 496 and as such goes with the 
land and may be claimed against any person deriving title from the vendee (Pan 
Daguila vs. Gaza, 12 Phil., 663; Mortera vs. Martinez, 14 Phil., 541; Lucido vs. 
Calupitan, 27. Phil., 148).</p>
<p align="justify">Section 57 of Act No. 496 provides that "an owner desiring to 
convey in fee simple his registered land or any portion thereof shall execute a 
deed of conveyance, which the grantor or grantee may present to the register of 
deeds in the province where the land lies. The grantor's certificate shall be 
produced and presented at the same time the register, of deeds shall thereupon * 
* * make out in the registration a new certificate of title to the grantee, and 
shall prepare and deliver to him an owner's duplicate certificate." And 
according to sec. 111 of the same Act, if the outstanding owner duplicate 
certificate is not presented, the Court may, upon petition of the vendee and 
after hearing, "order the registered owner or any person withholding the 
duplicate to surrender the same, and direct the entry of a new certificate upon 
such surrender." Said section 111, reads as follows: "In every case where the 
clerk or any register of deeds is requested to enter a new certificate in 
pursuance of an instrument purporting to be executed by the registered owner, or 
by reason of any instrument or proceedings which divest the title of the 
registered owner against his consent, if the outstanding owner's duplicate 
certificate is not presented for cancellation when such request is made, the 
clerk or register of deeds shall not enter a new certificate, but the person 
claiming to be entitled thereto may apply by.petition to the court. The court, 
after hearing, may order the registered owner of any person withholding the 
duplicate to surrender the same, and direct the entry of a new certificate upon 
such surrender."</p>
<p align="justify">The petition shall be filed with the Court of First Instance 
and entitled in the original case in which the decree of registration was 
entered, according to the last paragraph of sec. 112 of Act No. 496, which 
provides that "any petition filed under this section, and <i>all petitions</i> 
and motions filed under the <i>provisions of this Act</i> after original 
registration shall be filed and entitled in his original case in which the 
decree of registration was entered." (Italics ours).</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, the order appealed from is affirmed with costs 
against the appellant. So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Tuason,</i> 
and <i>Montemayor, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
