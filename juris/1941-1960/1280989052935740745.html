				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In his lifetime, Nicomedes Infante was married twice: first to 
Pilar Alcazar and later, after her death, to Felisa Conjuico.  His 
children with Pilar were Narciso, Antonio, Abraham, Jorge and Porfirio; 
Felisa gave him Jose, Filemon, Corazon, Arsenio and Aquiles.
  <p>    Nicomedes and Pilar acquired during their marriage certain 
lands known as Lots Nos. 862, 713, 4035, 4036 and 4037 of the Dumaguete,
 Oriental Negros Cadastre.  While married to Felisa, Nicomedes Infante 
conveyed the said five lots<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 to Felix Barot, who subsequently obtained the corresponding transfer 
certificates of title to three lots, the other two continuing to be 
registered in the name of the conjugal partnership of Nicomedes Infante 
and Pilar Alcazar.</p>
  <p>    Two years after the death of Nicomedes Infante, i.e., in 
October 1939, Felix Barot conveyed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 to the children of Nicomedes and Pilar, namely Narciso, Antonio, 
Abraham and Jorge (Porfirio's whereabouts being unknown since 1934) the 
above-mentioned five lots, by a duly notarized document.  Afterwards, 
Abraham and Jorge having died single, Justina Equio and Pablita 
Valencia, representing their minor children with their deceased husbands
 Narciso Infante and Antonio Infante, filed in the corresponding 
Cadastral expedientes, a motion alleging they were the only heirs of the
 four brothers Narciso, Antonio, Abraham and Jorge, who had purchased 
the five lots from Felix Barot, and praying for the cancellation of the 
original certificates of title of the conjugal partnership of Nicomedes 
Infante and Pilar Alcazar, plus the transfer certificates of title in 
the name of Felix Barot, and for the issuance thereafter of separate 
transfer certificates of title in the names of their minor children.  
That was in May, 1951.</p>
  <p>    Advised of the above petition, Nicomedes' second wife and her 
children voiced their opposition, claiming the lots were conjugal 
properties of the first marriage, and that as legitimate wife and 
children of Nicomedes Infante, they were also heirs not only of 
Nicomedes but of the latter's dead sons Abraham, Jorge and Porfirio.</p>
  <p>    After hearing both sides, the Hon. Juan O. Reyes, Judge, 
promulgated an order dated Jan. 30, 1952, recognizing the oppositor's 
rights to participate in the realty, and directing the Register of Deeds
 of Oriental Negros to cancel the certificates of title and to issue 
transfer certificates of title to movants and oppositors, in proportions
 which are immaterial to the litigation pending before us.</p><p>A motion for reconsideration filed by the movants was denied on 
April 19, 1952.  On July 20, 1952, movants' new attorneys made a motion 
to vacate the orders of Jan. 30, and April 19, all of 1952, asserting 
lack of jurisdiction.  Acting thereon, Judge Reyes ruled as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>"Without expressly deciding the question of jurisdiction, 
this Court feels that it is now powerless to vacate said orders of 
January 30 and April 19, 1952, because said orders had already become 
final and executory.  The second order amending the first order was 
served upon all the parties, thru their attorneys including Attys. 
Eleccion and Sindiong who were the attorneys of record of the original 
petitioners, on April 21, 1952.  The motion to vacate was only filed on 
July 30, 1952, or more than 3 months from the date the attorneys of the 
petitioners were duly notified of the last order of this court of April 
19, 1952.  WHEREFORE, said motion to vacate said orders is hereby 
DENIED."</blockquote> 
  <p>Consequently petitioners instituted here the instant petition 
grounded on their proposition that the lower court "transcended its 
jurisdiction": (a) in "ignoring" the transfer of said lots by Nicomedes 
Infante to Felix Barot and (b) in impairing the "unqualified right" of 
Felix Barot to transfer his registered rights over the three lots to 
Narciso, Antonio, Abraham and Jorge.</p>
  <p>    It will be seen that the two grounds of this special civil 
action for certiorari rest upon the allegation that the two deeds of 
conveyance, one by Nicomedes Infante to Felix Barot and another by Felix
 Barot to Narciso and his three brothers, <i>were true and veritable 
contracts of sale.</i> But the answer asserts, that they merely 
represented a mortgage in the form of "pacto de retro" and redemption 
subsequently effected by Narciso Infante for the benefit of all the 
heirs of Nicomedes Infante.  This allegation of fact in the answer, not 
having been traversed by petitioners must be accepted at its face value,
 specially because as may be gathered in the challenged orders, "there 
was no question of fact" and <i>the issues</i> in the court below 
centered around the proportion of the shares to be awarded to the heirs 
of the Infante brothers and their half-brothers, it being admitted that 
all (including Felisa Conjuico) had rights to the said lots formerly 
belonging to the conjugal partnership of Nicomedes Infante and Pilar 
Alcazar.  Now, even if the trial judge had made a mistake in the 
mathematical apportionment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 - a point not decided here - the mistake by itself could not, and did 
not amount to excess of jurisdiction.  It was mere error, if any, 
corrigible by appeal in due time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
  <p>    And this consideration brings out another reason why this 
petition may not be granted: the petitioners had another remedy by 
appeal <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>.  The circumstance 
that, at the beginning of this certiorari proceeding, the period for 
such appeal had already lapsed, does not usually modify the principle<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>.  Otherwise parties who thru 
negligence or other circumstances failed to appeal on time will resort 
to these special remedies to accomplish the revision of executory 
judicial decisions.</p>
  <p>    In connection with the second ground of their petition, 
petitioners assert that the court ignored the unqualified privilege of 
Felix Barot to transfer his registered rights, thereby contravening Sec.
 112 of Art. 496 under which the proceedings in the lower court were 
initiated.  Said section provides in part: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>". . . . . . Provided, however, that this section shall not be 
construed to give the court authority to open the original decree of 
registration, and that nothing shall impair the title or other interest 
of a purchaser holding a certificate for value and in good faith, of his
 heirs or assigns, without his or their written consent."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Petitioners assert that Barot's rights had been impaired.  Yet they
 have shown no authority to litigate for Barot, and defend his 
privileges.  And as the assignees of Barot, they can not complain 
because, having started the proceedings in the lower court, they had 
practically given "written consent" within the meaning of the 
above-quoted statutory provision.</p>
  <p>     Anyway, and again, the error, if any, was corrigible by appeal
 and could not amount to excess of jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>     Petition denied, with costs in favor of respondents.  So 
ordered.</p>
