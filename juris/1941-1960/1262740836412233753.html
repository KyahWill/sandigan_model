				G.R. No. L-710, March 05, 1948</h4>
				<H3>THE REPUBLIC 0F THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. LEANDRO GONZALES, DEFENDANT AND APPELLENT.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant-appellant was accused of treason in the People's Court on seven 
counts. The appealed judgment — which found the appellant guilty and sentenced 
him to <em>reclusión perpetua</em>, with corresponding accessory penalties, and 
to pay a fine of ten thousand pesos and the costs, — contains specific 
pronouncements expressly overruling counts 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. As to the third 
count, the People's Court merely held that; "The accused, on the night of 
December 31, 1944, participated in a raid on barrio Curiba, Lipa, Batangas, made 
by a patrol of Japanese soldiers and other Filipino followers and on that 
occasion apprehended fifteen persons and brought them to the barrio of 
Mataas-na-kahoy of the same municipality. However, while those persons who were 
apprehended were presumably killed because they have not reappeared up to the 
present time, there is no evidence to show that the accused took part in their 
execution. The witnesses on this count were Fidel Hernandez, Remigia Lorzano and 
Marcelo Peña." with reference to the sixth count, the appealed judgment contains 
the following conclusions: "The accused on February 27, 1945, participated in 
the burning of the houses in barrio Cumba, Lipa, Batangas, which was perpetrated 
by a patrol of Japanese soldiers and their Filipino followers, because they 
suspected the people residing therein to be guerrillas. The witnesses who 
substantiated this count were Fidel Hernandez who testified that he saw the 
accused burn his house and the house belonging to Crisanto Mendoza, Julian Sara 
and Enrique Sara; Remigia Lorzano who testified that she saw the accused set 
fire to her house and the houses of her brother-in-law and two consins; and 
Marcelo Peña who testified that he saw the accused apply a torch to his house 
and the houses of Asuncion Hernandez, Benito Hernandez, Sofia Katigbak and 
Melquiades Careng. While it is true that no two witnesses saw the accused burn 
the same house but instead saw him burn separate group of houses the overt act 
of treason in this case is the burning of the houses as a whole in the barrio of 
Cumba, The act was a single, continuous, composite act made of several 
circumstances and passing through several stages. In such a case it is not 
necessary that there be two witnesses to each circumstance in each stage; it is 
sufficient that the witnesses were able to testify to the act as a whole."
<p>Counsel for the appellant has limited the scope of his brief to the task of 
demonstrating that the People's court erred in sustaining count 6, thereby 
assuming that all the other counts upon which the appellant was indicted, did 
not form part of the basis of appellant's conviction under the appealed 
judgment. The brief for the Government, however, undertakes to show not only 
that the error attributed to the People's Court does not exist, but that the 
appellant was not entirely acquitted of count 3 which charges the following 
treasonable acts: "(<em>a</em>) Appellant's participation in the raid in barrio 
Cumba by a patrol composed of Japanese soldiers and the Makapilis. (<em>b</em>) 
His participation in the arrest and apprehension of 15 persons in connection 
with said raid. (<em>c</em>) The execution of 15 of the persons arrested." In 
other words, it is contended for the Government that "the fact that the trial 
court absolved the defendant of the last charge, that is, his participation in 
the execution of most of the persons arrested does not necessarily mean that he 
is cleared of all the charges in said count. It simply means that instead of 
finding him guilty of the complex crime of treason with murder, he was convicted 
merely of treason."</p>
<p>It is our opinion that the appellant cannot, on the merits, be convicted of 
treason as defined and penalized in Article 114 of the Revised Penal Code, even 
if the overt acts charged in the sixth count are admitted as having been proved 
in the manner stated in the appealed Judgment, for lack of compliance with the 
two-witness principle. Indeed, the brief for the appellee points out that "It is 
true, as the trial court said, that no two witnesses saw the accused turn the 
same house. Fidel Hernandez testified that at about 10 o'clock a. m. of February 
27, 1945, he saw the accused and companion, with rags and gasonline, burn his 
(Fidel Hernandez') house, and that of Crisanto Mendoza, Julian Sara and Enrique 
Sara (pp. 19-20, t. s. n.). Remigia Lorzano stated that at about 6:30 a. m. of 
the same day she saw the accused igniting a piece of rag and setting her house, 
as well as the houses of his brother-in-law and her two cousins, on fire (p. 96, 
t. s. n.). The last witness Marcelo Peña testified that at about 9 o'clock a.m. 
he saw the accused and companion pour gasoline on the houses of Asuncion 
Hernandez, Benito Hernandez, Sofia Katigbak and Melquiades Garin and burn said 
houses afterwards (pp. 125-128, t. s. n.)." In People <em>vs</em>. Adriano, 
L—477, decided on June 30, 1947, we already have had occasion to explain, in 
quite emphatic terms, the meaning of the two-witness requirement. There we 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is necessary to produce two direct witnesses to the <em>whole</em> overt 
act. It may be possible to piece bits together of the same overt act, if so, 
<em>each</em> bit must have the support of two oaths."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant's conviction can neither be predicated on the third count, not only 
because the corresponding pronouncements of the People's Court (hereinabove 
quoted) do not specifically intimate that the acts charged in said count and 
proven at the trial constitute treason — a failure or silence amounting to 
acquittal, — but because, even supposing said acts to be treasonable, we are 
inclined to discard the testimony of the witnesses Remigia Lorzano and Larcelo 
Peña who had made the glaring contradiction to the effect that while the first 
testified that Hilario Peña was at the house alleged in count 3 to have been 
raided, Marcelo Peña stated that his father (Hilario Peña) was not in said 
house. Upon the other hand, there can be no doubt that the People's Court 
obviously based the judgment of conviction on the acts charged in the sixth 
count, for it made the express assertion that "<em>the overt act of treason</em> 
in this case is the burning of one houses as a whole in the barrio of 
Cumba."</p>
<p>The appealed judgment will therefore be, as the same is hereby, reversed and 
the defendant-appellant acquitted, with costs <em>de oficio</em>. So 
ordered.</p><em>Moran, C.J., Feria, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and

<p><strong>PABLO, M.:</strong></p>
<p>No estoy conforms con la absolución del acusado. Hay no solaramte dos, sino 
tres, que testificaron que el acusado quemó la mitad del barrio de Cumba, Lipa, 
Batangas. El cargo No. 6 es del tenor siguiente: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"6. That on or about the 27th day of February, 1945, in the municipality of 
Lipa, province of Batangas, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the said 
accused Leandro Gonzales, with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy, did 
join, participate and take part in a raid on the barrio of Cumba of said 
municipality made by a patrol composed of Japanese soldiers and Makapilis, and 
on the occasion thereof the said patrol did burn and set fire to approximately 
one-half (½) of the houses in said barrio for alleged guerrilla activities." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Los autos demuestran que Fidel Hernández declaró que en 27 de Febrero de 
l945, a eso de las 10:00 de la mañana, el acusado y sus compañeros, japoneses y 
espias filipinos, provistos de trapos y gasolina, quemaron su casa (de Fidel 
Hernandez), la de Crisanto Mendoza, de Julian Sara y de Enrique Sara. Remigia 
Lorzano declaró que a eso de las 6:30 a. m. del mismo día el acusado encendió un 
pedazo de trapo con el cual quemó su casa (de Remigia lorzano) como también la 
casa de su cuñado y de sus dos primos. Marcelo Peña declarò que a eso de las 
9:00 a. m. del mismo día el acusado con compañeros vertieron gasolina en las 
casas de é1 (de Marcelo Peña), de Asunción Hernandez, Benito Hernandez, Sofía 
Katigbak y Melquiades Gareng prendiendo fuego después. Todas las trece casas se 
redujeron a cenizas. Fidel Hernández presenció la quema de su casa y la de tres 
personas; Remigia Lorzano vió al acusado quemar su casa de ella y la de su 
cañado y dos primos, y Marcelo Peña presenció el acto del acusado con sus 
compañeros al quemar las casas de él, de Asunción Hernandez, Benito Hernandez, 
Sofia Katigbak y Melquiades Gareng: total, trece casas.</p>Si la acusación 
consistiese solamente en la quema de una casa, como la de Fidel Hernández, por 
ejemplo, no se le puede condenar al acusado porque no hay más que un solo 
testigo y es el cuñado de Fidel Hernandez; pero se le acusó de haber quemado con 
sus compañeros japoneses y Makapilis aproximadamente la mitad de las casas del 
barrio para inutilizar a sus habitantes que son guerrillas para sembrar el 
terror en todas partes y subyugar a todos por medio de la destrucción. Hay pues, 
tres testigos que declararon que trece casas — parte de la mitad de las casas 
del barrio de Cumba, del municipio de Lipa, de la provincia de Batangas — han 
sido quemadas por el acusado y sus compañeros. Una casa es solamente una parte 
de la mitad del barrio; no es necesario que haya dos testigos para probar la 
quema de una casa: lo que se necesita es el testimonio de dos testigos, por los 
menos, de la quema de la mitad de las casas del barrio, que es el objeto de la 
acusación. No debemos olvidar que se le acusó de haber quemado la mitad de las 
casas del barrio y no de haber quemado las casas solamente.<br> Opino que 
debe confirmarse la sentencia condenatoria. <br><br><br>

<p align="center">DISSENTING</p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>In my opinion, there is sufficient evidence, satisfying the two-witness rule, 
to find appellant guilty under count 3, referring to the raid made by the 
Japanese accompanied by him and other Filipino followers on December 31, 1944, 
New Year's Eve, in barrio Cumba, Lipa, Batangas, in which raid fifteen persons 
were apprehended and brought to the barrio of Mataas-na-Kahoy of the same 
municipality. It would be closing our eyes to the reality of things if we were 
not to understand that those fifteen persons were apprehended and dealt with in 
the manner stated, by the Japanese, either because they were guerrillas or 
guerrilla suspects, or other kind of underground movement members, or suspects 
of being such.</p>
<p>Under count 6, although the two-witness rule may not have been satisfied, I 
am of opinion that conviction for arson as a common crime is in order. </p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed;Defendant acquitted.</em></p></div>
