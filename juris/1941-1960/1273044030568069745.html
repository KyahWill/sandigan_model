				<H3>L. G. MARQUEZ AND Z. GUTIERREZ LORA, PLAINTIFFS. L. G. MARQUEZ, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. FRANCISCO VARELA AND CARMEN VARELA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal against an order of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila dismissing the complaint as to plaintiff L. G. Marquez. The 
pertinent allegations of the complaint are as follows: that plaintiff Gutierrez 
Lora was authorized by defendants to negotiate the gale of their share or 
interest in a parcel of land on Plaza Goiti, Manila, and having met his 
co-plaintiff L. G. Marquez, a real estate broker, both of them agreed to work 
together for the sale of defendant's property; that they found a ready, willing, 
and able buyer, which accepted defendants' price and terms, but that thereafter 
defendants, without any jusifiable reason, refused to carry out the sale and 
execute the necessary deed therefor; and that as a consequence plaintiffs failed 
to receive the commission which they were entitled to receive. The defendants 
presented a motion to dismiss the complaint as to L. G. Marquez on the ground 
that he has no cause of action against defendants, and this motion having been 
granted, plaintiff L. G. Marquez has prosecuted this appeal. 
<p align="justify">The complaint was dismissed on «the alleged ground that it 
states no cause of action against the defendants. Is this objection to the 
complaint justified? The term "cause of action" has been held to be synonymous 
with "right of action" (37 Words and Phrases, 642), but in the law of pleading 
(Code Pleading) one is distinguished from the other in that a right of action is 
a remedial right belonging to some person, while a cause of action is a formal 
statement of the operative facts that give rise to such remedial right. The one 
is a matter of right and depends on the substantive law, while the other is a 
matter of statement and is governed by the law of procedure. (Phillips, Code 
Pleading, section 189, page 170.)</p>
<p align="justify">It is not denied that Lora, if he rendered the service alleged 
in the complaint, would have a right to be paid compensation for the service he 
rendered jointly with Marquez. He acted as a broker, and a broker is entitled to 
a commission for his services. (Article 277, Code of Commerce; Henry vs. 
Velasco, 34 Phil, 587; Perez de Tagle vs. Luzon Surety Co., 38 Off. Gaz., 1213.) 
There is no prohibition in law against the employment of a companion to look for 
a buyer; neither is it against public policy. Neither was there even any implied 
understanding between Lora and the defendants that no part of the compensation 
to which Lora would be entitled to receive could be paid to any companion or 
helper of Lora. Marquez's right to compensation can not, therefore, be disputed 
under the operative facts set forth in the complaint. </p>
<p align="justify">The next issue is, is there a cause of action in favor of 
Marquez against the defendants? From the facts alleged in the complaint, it is 
clear that there is a primary right in favor of Marquez (to be paid for his 
services even through Lora only) and a corresponding duty devolving upon the 
defendants (to pay for said services). Since (as alleged) defendants refuse to 
comply with their duty, Marquez now is entitled to enforce his legal right by an 
action in court. The complaint in the case at bar, therefore, contains both the 
primary right and duty and the delict or wrong combined which constitute the 
cause of action in the legal sense as used in Code Pleading (Pomeroy, Code 
Remedies, section 347), and the cause of action is full and complete.</p>
<p align="justify">Objection to the complaint, however, is not that Marquez has no 
right to share in the compensation to be paid Lora, whom defendants had directly 
engaged, but that Marquez can not join in this action and enforce therein his 
rights directly against the defendants, evidently because defendants never dealt 
with Marquez, directly or indirectly, or, in other words, that both Marquez and 
his services were not known to them. The following parts of defendants' motion 
to dismiss show that such in fact was the objection:</p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>This paragraph clearly shows that the authority to sell was 
only given to plaintiff Z, Gutierrez Lora and not to the other plaintiff L. G. 
Marquez. Attention is respectfully called to the word "plaintiff" used in said 
paragraph III and expressed in singular form to the exclusion of the other 
plaintiff L. G. Marquez. If the plaintiff L. G. Marquez had worked at all for 
the sale of the property at the instance of an invitation of his co-plaintiff Z. 
Gutierrez Lora, we maintain that his action if there is any is against his 
co-plaintiff and not against the defendants herein.<p></p>
<p align="justify">As far as the defendants are concerned in this case, plaintiff 
L. G. Marquez is not only a stranger in this case hut also unknown to the 
defendants; and if he had worked at all for the sale of the defendants' share 
and participation in the parcels of lands referred to in the complaint, the same 
was made not only at his own lookout, risk and responsibility but also with no 
authority whatsoever. (Record on Appeal, pages 16, 17.)</p></blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">The principle underlying defendants' objection is one of 
procedure, not of substantive law, recognized under the common law, where no one 
could sue for the breach of a contract who was not a party thereto, and the 
action allowed to be brought only in the name of the one holding the legal 
title. The requirement was based upon the doctrine of privity of contract. </p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>SEC. 234. <span style="font-style: italic;">Plaintiffs in Action ex Contractu</span>.—When an action of 
contract concerns only the original parties to the instrument, it is not 
difficult to determine who should be the plaintiff. Obviously the one seeking to 
enforce it is the real party in interest. At common law, no one could sue for 
tha breach of a contract who was not a party thereto. Hence an action on 
contract, whether express or implied, was required to be brought in the name of 
the one who held the legal interest. This requirement was based upon the 
doctrine of privity of contract. * * * (Phillips, Code Pleading, page 226.) <p></p>
<p align="justify">SEC. 235. <span style="font-style: italic;">Privity of Contract</span>.—<span style="font-style: italic;">When Necessary</span>.—It was a rule 
of the common law that before one may complain of another for breach of 
contract, there must be some direct contractual relation, or privity, between 
them; and this, with only a few exceptions, is a requirement of the law today. * 
* * (Phillips, Code Pleading, page 227.)</p>
<p align="justify">At common law, in order that two or more persons may join in an 
action upon a contract, there must be community of interest between them; that 
is, they must be parties to the contract and jointly interested therein. (47 C. 
J., 54.) </p>
<p align="justify">Persons subsequently admitted to the benefit of a contract, 
without the privity or assent of the promisor, can not join in a suit on the 
contract. (47 C. J., 55.)</p></blockquote> <p></p>

<p align="justify">But we did not import into this jurisdiction the common law 
procedure. Our original Code of Civil Procedure (Act 190) was taken mainly from 
the Code of Civil Procedure of California, and this in turn was based upon the 
Code of Civil Procedure of New York adopted in that stated in 1948. Our system 
of pleading is Code Pleading, that system used in the states of the Union that 
had adopted codes of procedure. The code system of pleading adopted in substance 
the rules of equity practice as to parties, under which "air persons having an 
interest in the subject of the action, and in obtaining the relief demanded, may 
be joined as plaintiffs." (Phillips, Code Pleading, section 251, page 247.) In New York and California interest in the subject matter, or 
in any relief growing out of the same transaction or series of transactions is 
sufficient to allow joinder. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid</span>., Footnote 10<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>, page 247.)</p><p align="justify"> Under the former 
Code of Civil Procedure "every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real 
party in interest," and "all persons having an interest in the subject of the 
action and in obtaining the relief demanded shall be joined as plaintiffs," and 
"if any person having an interest and in obtaining the relief demanded refuses 
to join as plaintiff, he may be made a defendant and the fact of his interest 
and refusal to join to be stated in the com plaint." (Section 114, Act 190.) The 
principle under lying the rule is that all persons having a material interest 
under the substantive law should be made parties, as distinguished from that of 
the common law which allowed only a two-sided controversy, each party to be 
opposed to the other. Phillips, Code Pleading, 2d ed., section 228, page 
216.)</p>
<p align="justify">The above principles have not been changed by the reforms in 
the rules in 1940 and 1941. The action is still to be prosecuted in the name of 
the real party in interest. Under section 6 of Rule 3, "All persons in whom * * 
* any right to relief in respect to or arising out of the same transaction * * * 
is alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally, or in the alternative, may, * * 
* join as plaintiffs * * *, where any question of law or fact comment to all such 
plaintiffs * * * may arise in the action; * * *" Plaintiff Marquez, in the case 
at bar, clearly falls under the above rule. He is entitled to be paid his 
commission out of the very contract of agency between Lora and the defendants; 
Lora and he acted jointly in rendering services to defendants under Lora's 
contract, and the same questions of law and fact govern their claims. The rules 
do not require the existence of privity of contract between Marquez and the 
defendants as required under the common law; all that they demand is that 
Marquez has a material interest in the subject of the action, the right to share 
in the broker's commission to be paid Lora under the latter's contract, which 
right Lora does not deny. This is sufficient to justify the joinder of Marquez 
as a party plaintiff, even in the absence of privity of contract between him and 
the defendants. </p>
<p align="justify">We find, therefore, that the complaint of Marquez was 
improperly dismissed. The order of dismissal is hereby reversed, with costs 
against defendants. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Pablo, Bengzon, Jugo,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bautista Angelo, JJ.</span>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">PARAS, C. J.: </p>
<p align="justify">I concur. For all practical purposes Marquez may be considered 
an intervenor. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>MONTEMAYOR, J.: </strong></p>
<p align="justify">With all due respect to the learned majority opinion with its 
plausible arguments and citations of authorities, I believe that the complaint 
of Marquez against the defendants-appellees was properly dismissed. There was 
absolutely no contractual relation or privity of contract between Marquez and 
the defendants, and as far as the latter are concerned, Marquez never rendered 
service to them, was never authorized to render said service, and he did no't 
exist in their realm of contracts and obligations. I reproduce with favor the 
two paragraphs contained in defendant's motion to dismiss and also reproduced in 
the majority opinion and which for purposes of reference I quote below: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"This paragraph clearly shows that the authority to sell was 
only given to plaintiff Z. Gutierrez Lora and not to the other plaintiff L. G. 
Marquez. Attention is respectfully called to the word 'plaintiff' used in said 
paragraph III and expressed in singular form to the exclusion of the other 
plaintiff L. G. Marquez. If the plaintiff L. G. Marquez had worked at all for 
the sale of the property at the instance of an invitation of his co-plaintiff Z. 
Gutierrez Lora, we maintain that his action if there is any is against his 
co-plaintiff and not against the defendants herein.</p>
<p align="justify">"As far as the defendants are concerned in this case, plaintiff 
L. G. Marquez is not only a stranger in this case but also unknown to the 
defendant; and if he had worked at all for the sale of the defendants' share and 
participation in the parcels of lands referred to in the complaint, the same was 
made not only at his own lookout, risk and responsibility but also with no 
authority whatsoever. (Record on Appeal, pages 16, 17.)" </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Marquez may have rendered some service in connection with the 
offer for sale and the supposed acceptance of said offer by the alleged 
prospective buyer of the property; but such service was clearly rendered at the 
instance of and for the benefit of his co-plaintiff Z. Gutierrez Lora. His 
possible interest in this case would be a share in any money that may be 
obtained or received by Gutierrez from the defendants as compensation for his 
services as broker by virtue of the contract of employment between him and the 
defendants, Marquez may possibly intervene in this case for he is obviously 
interested in the success of Gutierrez in obtaining a favorable judgment, but lo 
proceed directly and file the claim against the defendants with whom he never 
contracted, who never saw him, much less employed him, he may not, in my 
opinion, do legally.</p>
<p align="justify">To sustain a litigation or defend one's self against a suit in 
court involves embarrassment, expenditure of time and money and vexation. A 
party has a right to be protected from being harassed, troubled and otherwise 
vexed by an action in court brought by total stranger with whom the party made 
defendant has never dealt with, much less had any contractual relation. In the 
field of torts, offenses, or violations of property rights such as forcible 
entry or detainer, etc. it is proper that all the persons having an interest in 
obtaining damages for the tort or offense committed or for any other relief 
should all be included as parties plaintiff against the tortfeasor, offender or 
the illegal occupant despite the absence of any previous contract. But in the 
present case the relief sought is the performance of a contract. Consequently, 
only those who were parties or privies to the contract can bring the action 
against the alleged violator of the agreement. Marquez in this case is 
attempting to enforce a contract entered into not between him and the defendants 
but between him, his co-plaintiff and defendants. To me, he has no right to do 
so. His right or cause of action lies against his co-plaintiff and not against 
the defendants. Consequently, I hold that the dismissal of the complaint as to 
Marquez was warranted. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Order reversed.</span></div>
