				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action instituted by&nbsp; plaintiff to annul title to property&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; Nicanor Padilla and Ambrosio&nbsp; Padilla and to have one issued in his own name,&nbsp; with damages&nbsp; representing rentals&nbsp; of said property, or,&nbsp; in case&nbsp; the above&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; granted, to recover the sum of P49,000 from, the defendants,&nbsp; which amount&nbsp; represents the value&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; property,&nbsp; and in either case for attorney's fees&nbsp; and&nbsp; expenses.<p>The principal allegations of the complaint are: That on January 10,&nbsp; 1945 plaintiff bought the&nbsp; property&nbsp; (a residential lot in Sampaloc, Manila)&nbsp; from defendant Arevalo, paying a price&nbsp; of P12,000 therefor, but&nbsp; assuming&nbsp; a mortgage&nbsp; thereon in favor&nbsp; of Pedro&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; in the amount of P30,000, and on. the&nbsp; same date the&nbsp; property&nbsp; was&nbsp; leased to Arevalo for P420 a month; that an option was&nbsp; granted in the contract of lease for the vendor&nbsp; to repurchase the property for the same price; that&nbsp; Arevalo also secured a loan from plaintiff in the amount of&nbsp; P4,000 payable on or before December 31, 1946; and that&nbsp; the contracts of sale and lease were registered in the office of the&nbsp; register of deeds of Manila on January&nbsp; 11, 1945;&nbsp; that on July 22f 1946&nbsp; defendant Arevalo sold&nbsp; the&nbsp; same property&nbsp; to&nbsp; her co-defendants Nicanor&nbsp; Padilla&nbsp; and Ambrosio Padilla for P25,000, notwithstanding the&nbsp; fact that the latter knew of the previous sale of&nbsp; the property to the plaintiff; that on April 11, 1947 Arevalo brought an action against plaintiff for a judicial declaration that the transaction between them, above set forth,&nbsp; is an equitable mortgage and&nbsp; not one&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; with&nbsp; repurchase, but&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp; Court decided that the contract was a&nbsp; sale with right to repurchase, and that if Arevalo wanted to&nbsp; redeem the property,&nbsp; she could do so, only for PI6,000;&nbsp; that defendants Padilla caused the deed of sale in their favor to be registered, notwithstanding the fact that they knew of&nbsp; the pendency of&nbsp; the&nbsp; action instituted&nbsp; by&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; against defendant Arevalo; and that defendant Arevalo has&nbsp; not repurchased the property in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court,&nbsp; and so plaintiff's title&nbsp; thereto&nbsp; has become consolidated.</p><p>Defendants Padilla filed a motion to dismiss the action, but the trial judge refused to consider it until after trial, so they filed their answer&nbsp; to the complaint, denying&nbsp; the supposed&nbsp; registration of the sale in&nbsp; favor of plaintiff; denying knowledge of said sale, or of the decision of&nbsp; the Supreme&nbsp; Court in relation&nbsp; thereto;&nbsp; denying&nbsp; the alleged registration of the sale in their&nbsp; (Padillas)&nbsp; favor during the pendency of the Supreme Court suit and alleging that said registration took place on July 24, 1946; and denying the alleged consolidation&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff's ownership in&nbsp; the property.&nbsp; By way of special defenses they alleged that at the time of the sale in their favor the property was registered in the name of&nbsp; Arevalo and the only encumbrance or lien thereon was the&nbsp; mortgage in favor of Pedro Reyes; that when the sale was agreed upon&nbsp; between Arevalo&nbsp; and themselves, they paid off the mortgage thereon and&nbsp; secured the certificate of title of the property and Arevalo executed an affidavit that the property was free from liens of any kind; that they purchased the property in good faith, for value and without notice,&nbsp; and the sale in their favor&nbsp; was registered, and a transfer certificate of title was issued in&nbsp; their name; and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; transaction between plaintiff and Arevalo was not validly registered,&nbsp; because the certificate of title was not&nbsp; surrendered or delivered for the registration thereon of the alleged sale in favor of plaintiff; etc.&nbsp; By way of counterclaim, they aver that the allegation that they bought the&nbsp; property&nbsp; with actual notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale in plaintiff's favor is a malicious and defamatory imputation,&nbsp; without basis&nbsp; in fact and they have suffered and will suffer as&nbsp; a consequence thereof moral damages estimated at P100,000. On the issues above set forth the parties went to trial and&nbsp; thereafter the court rendered jud&amp;imnt finding that the defendants Padilla did not have any knowledge of the sale&nbsp; by Arevalo in favor of plaintiff, and holding that the attempted registration of said sale cannot prevail over that in favor of defendants Padilla; and further finding that the&nbsp; bringing of the action&nbsp; was&nbsp; malicious.&nbsp; It therefore sentenced plaintiff to&nbsp; pay to defendants Padilla the sum of P100,000&nbsp; as moral damages.&nbsp; The&nbsp; suit&nbsp; was&nbsp; further dismissed with costs against plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the&nbsp; appeal.</p><p>The first error assigned is the refusal of the trial court to admit in&nbsp; evidence Exhibit&nbsp; "A",&nbsp; the deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of plaintiff,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; "B",&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract of lease executed by and between&nbsp; him and Areyalo,&nbsp; Exhibit "C", the&nbsp; promissory note executed&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; favor by Arevalo, Exhibit "D",&nbsp; the decision of this Court in&nbsp; the case between plaintiff and Arevalo, and Exhibit "G", motion&nbsp; of Arevalo that&nbsp; she is not&nbsp; in&nbsp; a position&nbsp; to repurchase the property&nbsp; for&nbsp; P16,000.&nbsp; The above&nbsp; documents&nbsp; were objected to on the ground that they cannot affect the Padillas&nbsp; as they had no previous knowledge thereof.&nbsp; The trial court sustained the objection on the ground that the Padillas were not parties to the execution of the documents. The above ruling&nbsp; is clearly erroneous.&nbsp; The deeds were executed&nbsp; by Arevalo prior to the sale by her in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Padillas.&nbsp; As the latter succeeded&nbsp; to the&nbsp; rights and interests&nbsp; of&nbsp; Arevalo,&nbsp; they&nbsp; are&nbsp; bound by&nbsp; the acts&nbsp; of Arevalo prior to the sale in their favor&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 13, Rule 123, Rules&nbsp; of Court),&nbsp;&nbsp; The Padillas are privies&nbsp; in&nbsp; so&nbsp; far&nbsp; as Arevalo is concerned,&nbsp; as&nbsp; they obtained their title from the&nbsp; latter; hence what is admissible against Arevalo before the&nbsp; sale in their favor is admissible against them.&nbsp; The documents prove&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged purchase&nbsp; made by plaintiff from Arevalo;&nbsp; they are&nbsp; therefore material&nbsp; and relevant to the issues raised in plaintiff's complaint and denied&nbsp; in defendants'&nbsp; answer.&nbsp; The fact that in point of law they may not be of any avail&nbsp; against the Padillas, who are alleged&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; purchasers&nbsp; in good faith, for&nbsp; value&nbsp; and without notice does not in any way affect or destroy their materiality or&nbsp; relevancy or admissibility.&nbsp; The claim&nbsp; that the Padillas are purchasers&nbsp; in&nbsp; good faith&nbsp; is&nbsp; a special defense; the mere fact that this is a valid defense which may destroy plaintiff's right or title does not&nbsp; make the documents indicative or probative of said title&nbsp; or right immaterial or irrelevant and inadmissible.</p><p>The second error relates to the refusal of the trial court to admit evidence&nbsp; offered of&nbsp; the value&nbsp; of the property subject&nbsp; of the&nbsp; action&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; the same&nbsp; is immaterial.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again&nbsp; the trial court committed the error. It is&nbsp; to be&nbsp; noted that the action is against the Padillas and&nbsp; against Arevalo&nbsp; also.&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; asks&nbsp; for an alternative&nbsp; relief, just&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; the original prayer for annulment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Padilla certificate of&nbsp; title can not be granted, which relief&nbsp; is for the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the value of the&nbsp; property and&nbsp; of which value plaintiff&nbsp; would be deprived if&nbsp; his main&nbsp; action is to fail.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of the actual market&nbsp; value was therefore material&nbsp; and relevant to plaintiff's claim to be paid the value of&nbsp; the property if his&nbsp; main case&nbsp; for&nbsp; annulment&nbsp; cannot be sustained. Again the fact that the Padillas have a&nbsp; supervening&nbsp; special defense does not make the evidence&nbsp; of the value less relevant or&nbsp; less material.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court should, therefore,&nbsp; have admitted the prof erred evidence.</p><p>The third error imputed to&nbsp; the trial court is the finding by&nbsp; it that&nbsp; no sufficient evidence was introduced&nbsp; that the Padillas had no knowledge&nbsp; in fact&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; and conveyance of the property in&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; favor.&nbsp; We have carefully read&nbsp; the evidence.&nbsp; The evidence&nbsp; submitted to support&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; on the part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Padillas of the conveyance in&nbsp; plaintiff's favor is the testimony of a&nbsp; witness who supposedly heard a statement made by Arevalo to Ambrosio Padilla that she&nbsp; (Arevalo) had previously sold the property to plaintiff.&nbsp; The making of the statement&nbsp; is improbable;&nbsp; why&nbsp; should&nbsp; Arevalo tell&nbsp; the prospective buyer that the&nbsp; land she is selling had already been sold by her to another? No buyer will court trouble, buying property already sold to&nbsp; another.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; supposed statement&nbsp; is&nbsp; furthermore belied&nbsp; by Arevalo's own affidavit that&nbsp; the property is&nbsp; free&nbsp; from&nbsp; liens of any kind. And the mere fact that the witness who testified thereto could not point out the specific occasion and date thereof when the statement was supposedly made, and the further fact that she spoke, of it voluntarily without being asked about&nbsp; the matter point convincingly to its falsity and the probability of its having been fabricated.&nbsp; On top&nbsp; of all these circumstances, credible evidence was submitted that at the time of the&nbsp; supposed meeting where the statement was supposedly made, Ambrosio&nbsp; Padilla&nbsp; had&nbsp; not&nbsp; yet occupied&nbsp; the&nbsp; room where&nbsp; the&nbsp; meeting&nbsp; was&nbsp; had, and further that&nbsp; it was not&nbsp; Ambrosio&nbsp; Padilla&nbsp; who arranged and concluded the sale with Arevalo, but his brother Dr. Nicanor Padilla. The finding of the trial court is correct; the evidence for plaintiff is insufficient and is&nbsp; completely overcome by&nbsp; the much more credible&nbsp; evidence presented by&nbsp; defendants.</p><p>The fourth&nbsp; assignment of error has&nbsp; reference&nbsp; to the holding of the trial court that the registration of plaintiff's deed of sale is incomplete and cannot prevail over the rights&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; who had secured registration of the deed&nbsp; of sale in&nbsp; their&nbsp; favor and&nbsp; the issuance of a certificate of title in their name.&nbsp; The above conclusion is also correct.&nbsp; In the first&nbsp; place,&nbsp; the act of registration is the operative act to convey&nbsp; and affect the land,&nbsp; an unregistered deed only operating as a contract between the parties and as evidence of authority to the register of deeds to make registration&nbsp; (Sec.&nbsp; 50,&nbsp; Land Registration Act.)&nbsp; The registration&nbsp; of defendants&nbsp; Padillas'&nbsp; deed affected the land conveying title thereto to them, as in fact a new certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title was issued in their favor.</p><p>As to&nbsp; plaintiff's deed&nbsp; of sale, as to which registration is voluntary, not&nbsp; involuntary,&nbsp; its presentation and entry in the day book without surrender&nbsp; of the title, did&nbsp; not operate to convey&nbsp; and affect the&nbsp; land sold or conveyed (Villasor <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Camon,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; CA. G. R. No. 8551, pronu June 29, 1951.)</p><p>Plaintiff appellant seeks excuse for his failure to complete registration in the troubled condition of the city at the time of the presentation of his deed.&nbsp; It is not true that said failure was attributable to the lack of order in the city.&nbsp; If he could secure the entry, he could also have secured complete registration.&nbsp; The&nbsp; real&nbsp; reason for said failure may be found in the fact that he did not surrender the title, which was then in the hands of the mortgagee Pedro&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; further&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; he&nbsp; did&nbsp; not make&nbsp; any effort to&nbsp; obtain its possession.&nbsp; Perhaps&nbsp; he knew that his right was subject to the, vendor's equity of repuchase&nbsp; and he&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; care to have the&nbsp; registration completed.&nbsp; In any case as the title&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; surrendered thru neglect or oversight on his own part,&nbsp; he&nbsp; can&nbsp; not invoke rights secured&nbsp; by&nbsp; registration,&nbsp; which defendants have secured in their favor.</p><p>Another error assigned on the appeal&nbsp; is the dismissal of the case as against Tomasa Arevalo, who&nbsp; does&nbsp; not appear to have answered the complaint and should have been declared in default.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason&nbsp; given by the trial court&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; supposed, failure&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; to prove bad faith.&nbsp; We must note that Arevalo was merely a formal party defendant to the action.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact, according to the record on appeal, plaintiff-appellant did not even care&nbsp; to have&nbsp; her&nbsp; declared in default. The principal purpose&nbsp; of the suit was to&nbsp; cancel the Padilla transfer certificate of title,&nbsp; not&nbsp; recover&nbsp; damages&nbsp; from Arevalo.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the principal parties defendants were&nbsp; absolved, so&nbsp; should the&nbsp; defaulting party Tomasa Arevalo. Besides,&nbsp; an^ claim by plaintiff against Tomasa&nbsp; Arevalo relating&nbsp; to the land subject matter of the action could not have been raised in the action, because said claim was barred by the decision in the previous suit betwwen plaintiff and&nbsp; Arevalo,.</p><p>The last error is the award of moral damages of P100,000. Moral damages have been&nbsp; defined&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:</p><blockquote><p>"ART. 2217.&nbsp; Moral damages include physical suffering, mental anguish,&nbsp; fright,&nbsp; serious anxiety, besmirched&nbsp; reputation,&nbsp; wounded feelings,&nbsp;&nbsp; moral&nbsp; shock, social humiliation, and&nbsp; similar injury. Though incapable of&nbsp; pecuniary&nbsp; computation,&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages may be recovered if they&nbsp; are the proximate result&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendant's wrongful&nbsp; act&nbsp; or omission."&nbsp; (Civil&nbsp; Code.)</p></blockquote><p>The grant of moral damages is not subject to the whims and caprices of judges&nbsp; or court.&nbsp; The court's&nbsp; discretion in&nbsp; granting&nbsp; or refusing it is&nbsp; governed by&nbsp; reason and justice.&nbsp; In&nbsp; order&nbsp; that&nbsp; a person may be made liable to the payment of moral damages,&nbsp; the law requires&nbsp; that his act be wrongful.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; adverse&nbsp; result of an&nbsp; action&nbsp; does not <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> make the act wrongful and subject the actor to the payment&nbsp; of moral&nbsp; damages.&nbsp; The law&nbsp; could&nbsp; not have meant&nbsp; to impose a penalty on the right to&nbsp; litigate; such&nbsp; right is so precious that&nbsp; moral damages may not be charged&nbsp; on those who&nbsp; may exercise it erroneously.&nbsp; For these the law taxes costs.</p><p>The question&nbsp; to be&nbsp; decided,&nbsp; therefore, is,&nbsp; Was&nbsp; the action "wrongful?"&nbsp; It must be&nbsp; remembered that Barreto had a valid&nbsp; deed of sale in his&nbsp; favor.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was entered in the day book of the register&nbsp; of deeds&nbsp; office.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale of the property in favor of the Padillas was subsequent to that&nbsp; in favor of Barreto,&nbsp; and subsequent also to the entry of .Barreto's deed.&nbsp; Granting&nbsp; that the Padilla&nbsp; deed was registered, the same would not avail against Barreto's if the Padillas had knowledge&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; previous&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in favor of Barreto.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barreto was under no obligation&nbsp; to presume that the Padillas did not have knowledge of the sale; here was a mere presumption only that good faith existed.&nbsp; As against such presumption&nbsp; Barreto&nbsp; had&nbsp; the right to introduce&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; to the contrary.&nbsp; He&nbsp; had the right to have that matter&nbsp; of knowledge investigated in a judicial proceeding;&nbsp; he had the right to litigate such fact. And no right to damages can accrue&nbsp; if it happens that the litigation is decided adversely against him.&nbsp;&nbsp; No injury can&nbsp; accrue by the exercise of a&nbsp; right.</p><p>On the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; the Padillas have no right to claim that Barreto should have known that they were purchasers in good faith.&nbsp; Knowledge by the&nbsp; Padillas of Barreto's prior sale may have been fabricated.&nbsp; Supposing&nbsp; it was so,&nbsp; the party&nbsp; introducing the evidence, if innocent of the wrong,&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; held liable for moral&nbsp; damages.&nbsp; The witness may be held to account for perjury, but this does not create the presumption that the&nbsp; party who introduced the witness was aware thereof.&nbsp; Proof&nbsp; of knowledge or of complicity in the perjury must be introduced to make the plaintiff's action&nbsp; wrongful and entitle&nbsp; the adverse party prejudiced thereby to moral damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case&nbsp; at bar, no&nbsp; such proof existed.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; same&nbsp; manner&nbsp; that&nbsp; good faith is presumed on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; Padilla, so&nbsp; should it be in favor of Barreto. The results of litigation, especially on issues of law, are indeed very uncertain; facts and&nbsp; circumstances are elicited in&nbsp; the course of&nbsp; trial which are&nbsp; never expected.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the result&nbsp; of&nbsp; the trial were adverse to&nbsp; Barreto did not alone make&nbsp; his act in bringing&nbsp; the&nbsp; action wrongful.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; we held&nbsp; thus,&nbsp; all actions&nbsp; would be wrongful because in&nbsp; most&nbsp; cases&nbsp; one party will lose; we would be imposing an unjust condition or limitation on&nbsp; the right to&nbsp; litigate.&nbsp; We hold that the award of&nbsp; moral damages in the case at&nbsp; bar is not justified by the facts and circumstances as well&nbsp; as the law. The judgment&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is&nbsp; affirmed insofar as it dismisses&nbsp; the action of&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant, but&nbsp; it is reversed insofar as it&nbsp; awards moral damages to&nbsp; defendants Padilla.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against plaintiff-appellant.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista&nbsp; Angela Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.
