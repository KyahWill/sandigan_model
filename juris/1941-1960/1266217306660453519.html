				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from the order of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; dated December 26, 1957, granting the petition for certiorari with injunction filed with it,&nbsp; and annulling the order of respondent Judge Geraldez of the Municipal Court of Manila, denying the motion to quash the information filed with him against the petitioner,&nbsp; restraining said Judge from further taking cognizance of the case.<br><br>The&nbsp; facts in this case are not in dispute.&nbsp; Petitioner Yao Lit (Yao Dit)&nbsp; was found by&nbsp; members of the&nbsp; Manila Police Department on August 15,1957 at Salazar-Benavides streets in Manila, acting&nbsp; suspiciously, and he was placed under arrest.&nbsp; In his&nbsp; possession,&nbsp; they&nbsp; found&nbsp; a Chinese jueteng list.&nbsp; To establish his identity and other personal circumstances, he was required to produce his alien certificate of registration, which he failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; do,&nbsp; as a result of which, the Office of the City Fiscal filed two complaints against him&nbsp; one&nbsp; for&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of the Gambling Law, Article 195&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code in the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; and another complaint for violation of&nbsp; Section 7&nbsp; of Republic&nbsp; Act 562,&nbsp; as amended, in the Municipal Court of the same city.&nbsp; On September 25, 1957, petitioner filed a motion to quash the&nbsp; second complaint in the Municipal Court on the ground that said court had no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; over the offense charged and that the Fiscal had no&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to file the complaint or information.&nbsp; Acting upon said&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; quash, respondent Judge denied&nbsp; the motion as well as the motion to reconsider his order of denial.&nbsp; Dissatisfied&nbsp; with said orders&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; municipal Judge,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; filed in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila, the present case for certiorari with injunction against the respondent Judge and the Assistant City Fiscal, seeking to annul the said orders of the respondent Judge and to restrain the latter from trying the case against him. <br><br>Appellants take the position that the City Fiscal, under Section 38&nbsp; (b) of Republic Act No. 409, as amended&nbsp; by Republic Act No. 1201, is charged with&nbsp; the prosecution of all crimes&nbsp; and&nbsp; violations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; city ordinances,&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance and&nbsp; in the Municipal Court of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Manila; that&nbsp; he is equally&nbsp; charged&nbsp; with the investigation of all crimes and violations of ordinances committed within said city and that this includes offenses and violations of the law by aliens. <br><br>Section 7 of Republic Act No. 562, as&nbsp; amended by Section 3 of Republic&nbsp; Act 751,&nbsp; provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 7. Every alien subject&nbsp; to the provisions of this Act&nbsp; shall, on demand of any immigration officials, or a&nbsp; member&nbsp; of the Philippine Constabulary,&nbsp; police, or other peace&nbsp; officer,&nbsp; exhibit his certificate of registration.&nbsp; In the case of an alien for whom a parent or legal guardian has applied for&nbsp; the registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; alien, the exhibition&nbsp; of the certificate herein required&nbsp; shall be made by such&nbsp; parent or legal&nbsp; guardian.&nbsp; Every alien, or parent or legal guardian of such&nbsp; alien, violating this section shall,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the option of the Commissioner of Immigration, be subject to an&nbsp; administrative fine not exceeding one hundred pesos, or be&nbsp; prosecuted and&nbsp; upon conviction&nbsp; be punished by a fine not exceeding two hundred pesos, or imprisonment for&nbsp; not more than&nbsp; thirty days, or&nbsp; both."<br></blockquote>It is significant to&nbsp; note that the original provisions&nbsp; of Section 7 of Republic Act&nbsp; 562, provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; the punishment&nbsp; of&nbsp; violation of&nbsp; its&nbsp; provisions,&nbsp; namely, failure&nbsp; to exhibit his certificate of registration when demanded by any immigration official or member of the Philippine Constabulary,&nbsp; police or other peace officer, with&nbsp; a fine not exceeding P200&nbsp; or imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or&nbsp; both, that is to say, that any such violation&nbsp; may immediately be&nbsp; followed&nbsp; by prosecution by the prosecuting official.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the amendment as above-reproduced, introduces the intervention of the Commissioner&nbsp; of Immigration in the sense that he has the choice or&nbsp; option&nbsp; to either subject the erring alien to an administrative fine or indorse his&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; before&nbsp; the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; logical conclusion is that the prosecuting official may not&nbsp; initiate prosecution until and unless the Commissioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Immigration has elected and&nbsp; decided upon said prosecution&nbsp; in lieu of an&nbsp; administrative charge and&nbsp;&nbsp; fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; well prepared&nbsp; appealed decision&nbsp; of Judge Antonio Canizares, he correctly discusses and resolves this question, and we reproduce&nbsp; with favor the pertinent portion of said&nbsp; decision:<br><blockquote>A cursory reading of the original provision&nbsp; (Sec. 7,&nbsp; Republic Act No. 562), shows that a violation thereof subjects the offender to prosecution before the court and if&nbsp; found guilty be punished by a fine&nbsp; not exceeding two hundred pesos,&nbsp; or&nbsp; imprisonment for not more&nbsp; than&nbsp; 30 days, or both,&nbsp; while the&nbsp; amendatory provision (Sec. 3, Rep. Act No. 751) gives the Commissioner of Immigration the discretion to&nbsp; choose&nbsp; whether to&nbsp; impose an administrative fine or&nbsp; to&nbsp; prosecute criminally&nbsp; the&nbsp; offender&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; court.&nbsp; It is clear that under&nbsp; the amendatory provision&nbsp; (Sec. 3,&nbsp; Rep.&nbsp; Act No. 751), the prosecuting official cannot immediately proceed to prosecute the offender without the Commissioner of Immigration having first exercised such discretion. This&nbsp; is obviously&nbsp; the&nbsp; intention of Congress, as can be gleaned from a reading of&nbsp; the Explanatory Note to House Bill No. 2138&nbsp; (Exh. 'H'), which is&nbsp; the bill that&nbsp; seeks to amend the Alien Registration&nbsp; Law&nbsp; of 1950&nbsp; (Rep.&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 562), the&nbsp; Congressional&nbsp; Record&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; and consideration thereof by the Senate (Exhs. '1-2', '1-3'), and also the appropriation of the sum of P50,000 for the&nbsp; employment of additional personnel for&nbsp; the Bureau of&nbsp; Immigration to&nbsp; carry out the provisions of Republic Act No. 751 considering the thousands of violations thereof expected to be&nbsp; investigated&nbsp; by&nbsp; said&nbsp; office. It&nbsp; is also clear that Congress intended to bestow&nbsp; upon the Commissioner of Immigration the&nbsp; duty of investigating and&nbsp; imposing administrative fines upon violators of the provisions of Republic Act No. 751,&nbsp; before&nbsp; their prosecution before the courts, for the&nbsp; reason that said official has better facilities&nbsp; than the prosecuting officials to&nbsp; carry&nbsp; out&nbsp; the provisions of&nbsp; said&nbsp; Act, the former official being the keeper of records pertaining to&nbsp; aliens.&nbsp; Moreover, as indicated in the explanatory note to House Bill No. 2138, the alien violator&nbsp; may&nbsp; have valid reasons for&nbsp; his&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply with the&nbsp; law, and for such light mist demeanor he would be more&nbsp; disposed to pay an&nbsp; administrative fine, assessed by the&nbsp; Commissioner of Immigration in accordance with the facts of the particular case,&nbsp; rather&nbsp; than undergo the trouble&nbsp; and expense&nbsp; of facing&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; prosecution. It&nbsp; can also be&nbsp; inferred that&nbsp; Congress,&nbsp; in enacting&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 751,&nbsp; intended that the prosecuting&nbsp; officials give their attention&nbsp; to more serious offenses than to violations of this Act, which can properly be handled by the Commissioner of Immigration.&nbsp; Furthermore, the Revised Charter of Manila, which has&nbsp; the nature of a&nbsp; general law, under which the Fiscal maintains that he has the duty and&nbsp; authority to investigate and&nbsp; prosecute&nbsp; all&nbsp; crimes and&nbsp; violations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; city ordinances, cannot prevail over&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 751,&nbsp; which is&nbsp; a special law, specially when the Charter of Manila does not contain any provision specifically repealing said special law.&nbsp; Consequently, the prosecuting fiscal, in&nbsp; immediately prosecuting the&nbsp; petitioner in&nbsp; court&nbsp; without first&nbsp; affording&nbsp; the Commissioner of&nbsp; Immigration an opportunity to exercise his&nbsp; discretion over&nbsp; the matter&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in the offense charged&nbsp; against the&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; acted in&nbsp; excess of his authority." <br></blockquote>In view&nbsp; of the foregoing, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed.&nbsp; The motion to quash should have been granted by respondent Judge.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs. <br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Bautista Angela,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
