				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs&nbsp; instituted this&nbsp; action in&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Masbate to recover a parcel of land sold under <i>pacto de retro</i> to defendants and to have the latter execute the necessary deed of resale after receiving from the clerk of court the money consigned by plaintiffs&nbsp; to&nbsp; cover&nbsp; the payment of redemption.<br><br>The main defense of defendants is that plaintiffs failed to comply with the&nbsp; requirements of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law to effect redemption&nbsp; within&nbsp; the period stipulated&nbsp; with the result that defendants irrevocably acquired the ownership of the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; They set&nbsp; up a counterclaim for&nbsp; damages resulting from&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of the action.<br><br>After the&nbsp; parties had submitted a stipulation of facts without reserving the right to present additional evidence the court rendered judgment recognizing the right of plaintiffs&nbsp; to repurchase&nbsp; the land' and&nbsp; ordering defendants to execute a deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; resale&nbsp; in their favor and to receive from&nbsp; the&nbsp; clerk of court the amount of P1,350 deposited by plaintiffs for that&nbsp; purpose, less the damages due&nbsp; the plaintiffs at the rate of P67.50 per quarter from November 15,1951 until delivery of the property, deducting therefrom the sum of P19.25 as expenses incurred by defendants in connection with the execution of the original deed of sale, without pronouncement as to costs. Appeal having been taken&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; the case certified to&nbsp; us on the ground&nbsp; that the&nbsp; questions&nbsp; involved are&nbsp; purely legal.<br><br>It appears that&nbsp; Doroteo de la&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; and his wife Julia Robles&nbsp; sold&nbsp; on&nbsp; January 28, 1949&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendants under <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de&nbsp; retro</span> a parcel of coconut&nbsp; land.&nbsp; The document was&nbsp; registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds.&nbsp; It was expressly agreed upon that the land may be redeemed within a period&nbsp; of&nbsp; three years from the date of the sale. On September 2, 1951, Doroteo&nbsp; de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Cruz went to&nbsp; the house of defendant&nbsp; Rafael L. Resurreccion to tell him that he wanted to redeem&nbsp; the&nbsp; land and, upon being asked if he had the money with him, De&nbsp; la Cruz answered in&nbsp; the negative.&nbsp; Thereupon,&nbsp; Resurreccion tried&nbsp; to dissuade him to redeem the land&nbsp; offering him a premium of P400, to Which De la Cruz replied that he would consult&nbsp; his wife., Thereafter, De la Cruz left promiasing to return later with his wife, but he never returned, and on October 17, 1951 he deposited with the clerk of court the sum of Pl,350 with the request that he notify defendants of the deposit.&nbsp; Then, on November 5, 1951, he&nbsp; and his&nbsp; wife instituted the present action.&nbsp; It further appears that sometimes after the execution&nbsp; of the deed of sale the spouses De la Cruz sold their rights over&nbsp; the land to one Narciso&nbsp; Aligada but of this transfer&nbsp; no&nbsp; advice was given to defendants.<br><br>The main issue to&nbsp; be&nbsp; determined hinges&nbsp; on whether plaintiffs can still redeem the land even if they made the offer to redeem within the period stipulated,&nbsp; considering that&nbsp; they had made the consignation not strictly in accordance with the requirements of the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants contend that&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; have forfeited their right to redeem because, while they made a deposit of the redemption money with the clerk of court, they however failed to give notice of their intention to deposit, and also because the deposit was not accompanied by proof of tender and the notice of&nbsp; consignation&nbsp; which the law requires. Plaintiffs on the&nbsp; other hand, contend&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; had substantially complied&nbsp; with&nbsp; the ' requirements of the law regarding consignation, arid, even if they failed,&nbsp; the tender of payment they made had the effect of&nbsp; preserving their right to the redemption.<br><br>We find merit in plaintiffs' contention.&nbsp;&nbsp; It should&nbsp; be noted that Doroteo de la Cruz offered to redeem the land from defendants&nbsp; on September 2,&nbsp; 1951, much prior to the expiration of the period of redemption, and when defendants tried to dissuade him to redeem the land upon&nbsp; payment of a premium&nbsp; of F400, which De la Cruz interpreted&nbsp; as a refusal to&nbsp; allow the redemption, plaintiffs&nbsp; lost no&nbsp; time in depositing&nbsp; the repurchase&nbsp; money and&nbsp; instituted the present action to enforce&nbsp; their right.&nbsp; These steps are more than necessary in contemplation of law&nbsp; to preserve their right&nbsp; of redemption.&nbsp; Whether&nbsp; therefore all&nbsp; the requirements of the law to make a valid consignation were complied with or not,&nbsp; it would appear to be&nbsp; of no consequence,&nbsp; the important&nbsp; thing being that the tender of payment be made within the period&nbsp; stipulated.<br><br>The above conclusion finds support incur jurisprudence, Thus,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rosales <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; and Ordaveza, 25&nbsp; Phil., 495, this Court said:&nbsp; "The further&nbsp; remarks of the Court to the effect that&nbsp; if the vendee refused&nbsp; to accept the amount of the price&nbsp; when offered it must be placed on&nbsp; deposit&nbsp; in order to&nbsp; prevent title vesting absolutely in the vendee were&nbsp; purely obiter.&nbsp; Such a rule has never been&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; in this jurisdiction. On&nbsp; the contrary, the settled rule, as&nbsp; evidenced by the four decisions&nbsp; discussed above, is that a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide&nbsp;</span> offer of the redemption price, where that is certain and&nbsp; fixed, is&nbsp; sufficient to&nbsp; preserve the vendor's right of action in&nbsp; case where the offer is refused."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, in the case of Canute <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Mariano,&nbsp; 37 Phil.,&nbsp; 840, this doctrine&nbsp; was reiterated thus: "The contention that the plaintiff lost her right to redeem because&nbsp; she&nbsp; failed to make judicial deposit of the purchase price.when the&nbsp; defendant declined&nbsp; to receive it, is not&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to serious&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; in&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the repeated decisions of this Court to&nbsp; the&nbsp; contrary collated and discussed&nbsp; in the case of&nbsp; Rosales <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Reyes and&nbsp; Ordaveza (25 Phil.,&nbsp; 495). In that&nbsp; case and in the cases cited, therein we declared that the settled rule in this jurisdiction is that a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> offer or tender of&nbsp; the price: agreed upon for the repurchase is sufficient to preserve the rights of the party making&nbsp; it, without the necessity of making judicial deposit, if&nbsp; the&nbsp; offer or tender&nbsp; is refused."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied)&nbsp; This is more so&nbsp; if an action is actually brought in court to enforce&nbsp; redemption for such action "tolls the term&nbsp; for the&nbsp; right&nbsp; of redemption"&nbsp; (Ong Chua <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Carr, 53&nbsp; Phil., 975).<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup><br><br>The contention, therefore, that plaintiffs have&nbsp; forfeited their right to redeem because they have failed to comply with the&nbsp; requirements of the&nbsp; law regarding consignation is of no moment, it appearing that plaintiffs not only made a tender of payment within the period stipulated but went to the extent of filing an action in court to protect their right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such&nbsp; steps come within the purview. of the decisions above adverted to.<br><br>The contention of defendants that&nbsp; plaintiffs have&nbsp; lost their right to redeem because pending the period of redemption they sold the land to one Narciso Aligada is also untenable for it appears that the sale was&nbsp; made subject to the <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de&nbsp; retro</span> sale made&nbsp; by; the plaintiffs to defendants.&nbsp; In fact, it was therein stipulated that&nbsp; part of the purchase price would be applied to the redemption payment; Such a clause is in effect a&nbsp; recognition on the part of the vendee of the right of the plaintiffs to&nbsp; redeem the land within the period stipulated.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, this is a&nbsp; defense that&nbsp; can be&nbsp; set up&nbsp; by Aligada&nbsp; and not by defendants.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from, is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
