				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Pedro Defensor&nbsp; and Bienvenida&nbsp; Gayho&nbsp; were the registered owners of lots&nbsp; Nos. 4715&nbsp; and 4724&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Cadastral Survey of January, Iloilo, with Certificates of Title Nos. 29521 and 29522, respectively.&nbsp; On March&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1948, Defensor and&nbsp; Gayno executed&nbsp; a&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of sale over lot No. 4715&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bibiana&nbsp; Defensor&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; A),&nbsp; and another over&nbsp; Lot No.&nbsp; 4724&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; Buenaventura Defensor (Exhibits).<br><br>About, three weeks after the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; Exhibits&nbsp; A and B, Vicente Brillo obtained judgment in Civil Case No. 1182&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Iloilo&nbsp; against Defensor and Gayno for the sum of P1,000.&nbsp; Writ of execution was&nbsp; issued on&nbsp; August 3, 1949&nbsp; and by virtue thereof, Lots Nos.&nbsp; 4715 and 4724 were levied upon by the provincial sheriff,&nbsp; which&nbsp; levy was duly recorded . in the Registry of Property and annotated in the owner's duplicate certificates of title.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 22,&nbsp; 1949&nbsp; Bibiana Defensor and&nbsp; Buenaventura Defensor (the vendees under Exhibits A and B)&nbsp; filed with the sheriff a&nbsp; third party claim over&nbsp; the two lots in question; wherefore, judgment creditor Vicente Brillo&nbsp; filed a bond&nbsp; of Pl,000 in favor of the sheriff,&nbsp; who went ahead, with the&nbsp; execution, sold the lots at&nbsp; public auction to&nbsp; Brillo&nbsp; as the highest bidder on December 13, 1949, and the owners having failed to redeem the lots within one year, executed&nbsp; in favor of Brillo&nbsp; on&nbsp; February&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; a&nbsp; final&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of sale, as a result of which Transfer Certificates of Title No's. T-9500 and T-9501 were&nbsp; issued in the&nbsp; latter's favor. Before the sale of Lots Nos. 4715 and 4724 in satisfaction of the judgment in&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1182, however, third party claimants Bibiana Defensor and Buenaventura Defensor&nbsp; commenced on&nbsp; November 3,&nbsp; 1949 the&nbsp; present action&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Iloilo to be declared owners of the lots in&nbsp; question and to have the levy on said lots in Civil Case&nbsp; No. 1182 annulled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days thereafter, or on&nbsp; November 5,&nbsp; 1949, claimants Bibiana and Buenaventura Defensor filed&nbsp; a notice of<span style="font-style: italic;"> lis pendens</span> in the Office of the Register of Deeds,&nbsp; and on the same day had their deeds of sale Exhibits A and B recorded in the books of the Register, but&nbsp; without the corresponding entries in the owners' duplicate, certificates of title. <br><br>No trial was had in the Court below because the parties submitted the&nbsp; case for decision on an agreed statement of facts&nbsp; (Rec. on&nbsp; App., pp. 18-23); and on the&nbsp; basis thereof, the Court rendered judgment, finding&nbsp; the levy in execution on the lots in question in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 1182 to be superior to the notice of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> in this&nbsp; case; that the&nbsp; deeds of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; Exhibits A and B in favor of claimants Bibiana and Buenaventura Defensor were&nbsp; fictitious&nbsp; and made&nbsp; only&nbsp; to avoid&nbsp; the enforcement of&nbsp; the judgment in Civil Case No. 1182; and dismissed the action. From this judgment, plaintiffs&nbsp; appealed to the Court of Appeals, which forwarded the appeal to us on&nbsp; the ground that it raises&nbsp; any question&nbsp; of law.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment appealed from should be affirmed.<br><br>First: The doctrine is well-settled that a levy on execution&nbsp; duly registered takes&nbsp; preference over a prior unregistered sale&nbsp; (Gomez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Levy&nbsp; Hermanoa, 67 Phil., 134); and that even if the prior sale is subsequently registered, before the' sale in execution but after the levy was&nbsp; duly made, the validity of the execution sale should be maintained, because it retro acts&nbsp; to the date&nbsp; of the&nbsp; levy (Vargas <i>vs. </i>Tansioco, 67 Phil., 308; Chin Liu &amp; Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Mercado, 67 Phil., 409; Philippine Executive Commission <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Abadilla, 74 Phil., 68); otherwise, the preference created&nbsp; by the levy would be meaningless&nbsp; and illusory (Philippine Executive Commission<i> vs.</i> Abadilla, <i>supra</i>).<br><br>Even assuming, therefore, that the entry of appellants' sales in the books of the Register of Deeds on November 5, 1949 operated to convey the.lands to&nbsp; them even without the corresponding entry in the owner's duplicate titles, the levy on execution&nbsp; on the same lots in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 1182 on&nbsp; August 3, 1949,&nbsp; and&nbsp; their&nbsp; subsequent sale to appellee Brillo&nbsp; (which&nbsp; retroacts to the date of the levy) still takes precedence&nbsp; over and&nbsp; must be&nbsp; preferred to appellants'&nbsp; deeds&nbsp; of sale which&nbsp; were&nbsp; registered only&nbsp; on November 5, 1949.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Landig <i>vs.</i> U. S. Comm. Co., 89 Phil., 6S8; Del&nbsp; Rosario <i> vs. </i> Santos,&nbsp; 66&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 254; Gomez <i> vs.</i> Levy Hermanos Inc.,&nbsp; 67 Phil., 134; Worcester <i> vs.</i>&nbsp; Ocampo,&nbsp; 34&nbsp; Phil., 646). <br><br>This result is a necessary consequence of the&nbsp; fact that the properties herein involved were duly registered under Act No. 496, and of the fundamental principle that registration&nbsp; is the operative&nbsp; act that&nbsp; conveys&nbsp; and&nbsp; binds&nbsp; lands covered&nbsp; by&nbsp; Torrens&nbsp; titles&nbsp; (sections&nbsp; 50,&nbsp; 51, Act&nbsp; 496). Hence, if appellants became owners of the properties in question by virtue of the&nbsp; recording of the&nbsp; conveyances in their favor,&nbsp; their title arose already&nbsp; subject to the levy in favor&nbsp; of the appellee, which had been&nbsp; noted ahead in the&nbsp; records of the Register of Deeds.<br><br>Thus, in Gomez <i>vs.</i> Levy&nbsp; Hermanos, Inc., 67&nbsp; Phil., 134, this Court explained (pp.&nbsp; 137-138):<br><blockquote>"The undisputed&nbsp; facts of this case disclose that when&nbsp; Levy Hermanos, Inc. attached the parcels of land in question and when said attachment was noted on the back of the certificates of title, there was nothing to show in the,registry that Apolonia Gomez had any right over the land.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true&nbsp; that&nbsp; she bought&nbsp; the&nbsp; lots with <i>pacto de retro</i> but the fact of her purchase was not noted&nbsp; on the certificates of&nbsp; title until long&nbsp; after the attachment and its inscription on the&nbsp; certificates. In the&nbsp; registry,. therefore, the attachment appeared in the nature of a real lien when Apolonia Gomez had her purchase recorded. The&nbsp; legal effect of the notation of said lien was to&nbsp; subject and subordinate the right of&nbsp; Apolonia Gomez, as purchaser,&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; lien.&nbsp; She&nbsp; acquired the&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; of the said parcels&nbsp; only&nbsp; from the date of&nbsp; the&nbsp; recording&nbsp; of her in the register, which took&nbsp; place on November 21,&nbsp; 1932&nbsp; (section 51 of Tabigue <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Green, 11&nbsp; Phil., 102; Buzon&nbsp; <i>vs. </i> Licuaco, 13 Phil., 854; Act No. 496; Liong-Wong-Shih <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Sunico and Peterson, 8 Phil., 91; and Worcester <i>vs.</i> Ocampd&nbsp; and Ocampo, 34 Phil., 646), and the right of ownership which she inscribed was not an absolute but a limited right, subject to a prior registered lien, by virtue of which Levy Hermanos,&nbsp; Inc. was entitled to the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment credit&nbsp; over&nbsp; the lands in question, a right which is preferred and superior to&nbsp; that&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; (section&nbsp; 51, Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 496 and decisions cited above). If she wanted to have an absolute title, free of all lien, she had to pay the judgment&nbsp; credit of Levy Hermanos, Inc.,&nbsp; or exercise, after the auction, the right of repurchase within one .year&nbsp; granted by law, in order to redeem the property purchased by Levy Hermanos, Inc."<br></blockquote>The present&nbsp; case&nbsp; is&nbsp; clearly differentiated from our decisions in Potenciano <i>vs.</i> Dineros,&nbsp; 97&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 196 and Barrido <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Barreto, 72 Phil., 187;&nbsp; in these cases the conveyances by the registered owners were duly presented for registration before the land was levied upon by the creditor, ' while in the case at bar the reverse obtains.<br><br>Second:&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; adequate proof to support the Court below in holding that the sales Exhibit&nbsp; A and B,&nbsp; made by the former&nbsp; registered owners Defensor&nbsp; and Gayno&nbsp; to appellants, were fictitious and&nbsp; executed merely to defraud appellee Vicente Brillo of his judgment (in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 1182.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that said sales were made during, the pendency of the Case No. 1182 and just barely three&nbsp; weeks prior to the rendition of&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the sales were&nbsp; not recorded in the Registry of&nbsp; Deeds until November&nbsp; 5, 1949, after the sheriff had&nbsp; already&nbsp; levied on the lots&nbsp; in question&nbsp; to&nbsp; execute&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; (in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 1182,)&nbsp; and also&nbsp; after appellants had filed&nbsp; in said ease their third party claim with the sheriff.&nbsp; Finally, no effort or attempt was ever made to complete&nbsp; the registration of the sales by the presentation of the owners' duplicate certificates&nbsp; of&nbsp; title to&nbsp; the Register so that the conveyances could be duly&nbsp; noted thereon.&nbsp; As the lower Court aptly observed, if plaintiffs had truly&nbsp; purchased and paid valuable consideration&nbsp; for the lots&nbsp; in&nbsp; question, they would have seen to it that their purchases were immediately recorded as required by law in order to perfect their titles and&nbsp; protect themselves against any .subsequent&nbsp; adverse claims of third persons.<br><br>The judgment appealed&nbsp; from is affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Endencia,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
