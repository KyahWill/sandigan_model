				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Simeon Salvador filed on May 18, 1954 an action in the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Rizal&nbsp; to&nbsp; recover&nbsp; from Oscar Pajares, among others, the sum of P2,500.00, plus interest, representing the value of&nbsp; extra labor and materials Salvador had used in the construction&nbsp; of the house of Pajares. Salvador claimed that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; to&nbsp; furnish extra labor and. materials because of the&nbsp; changes&nbsp; and alterations in the original plan and specifications which Pajares ordered in the course&nbsp; of construction.<br><br>Pajares admitted that&nbsp; the construction&nbsp; had&nbsp; deviated from the original plan and specifications but claimed that the changes&nbsp; were&nbsp; effected&nbsp; at the instance&nbsp; of Edilio L. Baluyot whom defendant claimed to be the real contractor. Alleging that Pajares&nbsp; could&nbsp; not demand full&nbsp; remedy from Baluyot unless joined in&nbsp; the case, Pajares&nbsp; filed a third party complaint against Baluyot, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; due&nbsp; time admitted over the opposition of plaintiff Salvador.<br><br>On August 5,&nbsp; 1955, the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; decision the dispositive part of which reads:<br><blockquote>"IN VIEW THEREOF, the Court renders judgment one in favor of the defendant and&nbsp; third party plaintiff, Oscar Pajares&nbsp; as against the plaintiff Simeon Salvador and the third-party defendant, Edilio L. Baluyot, for&nbsp; them to pay the former, jointly and severally, the following amounts: P700.00 representing Pajares' expenses on the cement foundation; Pl,390.00 as reasonable expenses to complete the construction; P2,000.00&nbsp; for attorney's fees of Atty. Victoriano Yamson; P5.00&nbsp; daily for&nbsp; failure to finish the house within the required period of time from July&nbsp; 28, 1953,&nbsp; until the&nbsp; house&nbsp; is completed and a building&nbsp; certificate&nbsp;&nbsp; is issued&nbsp; by the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Engineer's office of Quezon City; and F2,000.00 for both moral and&nbsp; exemplary damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint and the counterclaim of plaintiff&nbsp; and&nbsp; third-party&nbsp; defendant, respectively,&nbsp; are hereby ordered.&nbsp; DISMISSED, with&nbsp; costs against&nbsp; both&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; and third-party&nbsp; defendant." <br><br></blockquote>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> in&nbsp; toto</span>&nbsp; the decision of the 
trial&nbsp; court.&nbsp; Baluyot filed a petition&nbsp; for review&nbsp; which&nbsp; was 
favorably&nbsp; entertained by this&nbsp; Court attributing several errors to the 
decision of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; assigns several errors as committed by&nbsp; the Court of Appeals but those which deserve consideration for the purposes of this appeal may be reduced to the following: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) in holding that the admission&nbsp; of the third party complaint was proper;&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; in not holding that petitioner was unduly deprived of his full day in&nbsp; court due to the&nbsp; unwarranted and improper admission of the third party complaint; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) in sustaining the trial court's judgment ordering&nbsp; petitioner to pay respondent&nbsp; the sum of&nbsp; P700.00 representing&nbsp; Pajares'&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; expenses on&nbsp; the&nbsp; cement foundation and the sum of P1,390.00 as reasonable expenses to complete the construction;&nbsp; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)&nbsp; in sustaining the trial court's award to respondent of&nbsp; the attorney's fee in the sum of P2,000.00, exemplary and moral damages in the sum of P2,000.00, and the penalty of P5.00 a day&nbsp; for the contractor's failure to complete the job within the stipulated period&nbsp; of time.<br><br>The first&nbsp; error cannot be entertained.&nbsp; When Simeon Salvador filed a complaint against Oscar Pajares to&nbsp; recover certain amount allegedly&nbsp; for&nbsp; extra&nbsp; labor&nbsp; and materials used&nbsp; by him&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; construction of Pajares' house&nbsp; and Pajares alleged in his answer that the real contractor was Baluyot and not Salvador who merely acted as his&nbsp; dummy or alter ego, Pajares found it necessary to include Baluyot as party defendant in order that he&nbsp; could press for trial all&nbsp; the claims he may have against both Salvador&nbsp; and Baluyot since Salvador deemed it wise&nbsp; to bring the action in his own name without including Baluyot as co-plaintiff. Since there was only one contract involving the construction of Pajares' house, it&nbsp; is evident&nbsp; that&nbsp; whatever claim Salvador may have against&nbsp; Pajares&nbsp; or the latter&nbsp; against Baluyot will have to necessarily refer to the same contract which makes it convenient that it be threshed out in one and the same&nbsp; case.&nbsp; Pajares'&nbsp; moved&nbsp; to&nbsp; have&nbsp; Baluyot brought into the case as&nbsp; party&nbsp; defendant was therefore proper for its main&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; is to&nbsp; avoid multiplicity of actions.&nbsp; Consequently, the&nbsp; trial court did not&nbsp; but act correctly when it admitted the third&nbsp; party complaint filed by&nbsp; Pajares for only&nbsp; in that way could all the questions pertaining to the construction of Pajares' house be threshed out jointly and not separately.<br><br>While under Section 1, Rule 12, of the Rules of Court a defendant who has a claim against a person not party to an action which has relation to&nbsp; plaintiff's claim may file with&nbsp; leave&nbsp; of&nbsp; court&nbsp; against&nbsp; such person a&nbsp; pleading called a third party complaint, and that the test for determining the propriety&nbsp; of the&nbsp; admission of a third party complaint is that there must be a showing that such third party&nbsp; is or might be liable&nbsp; to&nbsp; the defendant or to&nbsp; the plaintiff for <span style="font-style: italic;">all&nbsp; or part of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant,</span> otherwise the remedy is not through a&nbsp; third party&nbsp; complaint but to file a separate&nbsp; and independent action,&nbsp; this&nbsp; test is not exclusive when its&nbsp; effect&nbsp; would result&nbsp; in&nbsp; multiplicity of&nbsp; actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases there are&nbsp; where even if the action that may be taken against a third party defendant is unrelated to plaintiff's claim against the third party plaintiff or defendant,&nbsp; if it appears that&nbsp; the&nbsp; third party is a necessary party to the case or one without whose intervention the real issue involved cannot be fully determined,&nbsp; a&nbsp; third&nbsp; party complaint&nbsp; has been allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact,&nbsp; our rules require that parties in interest without whom&nbsp; no&nbsp; final&nbsp; determination can be had in an action be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants in order that all the issues&nbsp; pertaining to&nbsp; the controversy may be threshed out in a&nbsp; single action with the end in view of avoiding multiplicity of suits&nbsp; (Sections 7 and 8, Rule 3, of the Rules of&nbsp; Court).&nbsp;&nbsp; And in line with this premordial purpose, former Chief Justice Moran cites many instances where a third&nbsp; party complaint&nbsp; was allowed against&nbsp; the third party&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; and the original plaintiff even if the third party&nbsp; defendant's liability is based on a contract unrelated&nbsp; to plaintiff's claim, for it has been aptly&nbsp; said that the question whether a third party complaint should be admitted or not&nbsp; is a matter that rests within the sound discretion&nbsp; of the court (See, I Moran, Comments on&nbsp; the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court, 1957&nbsp; ed., pp. 192-197).&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; therefore find no error either on the part of the trial court or on the part of the Court of Appeals in bringing Baluyot as party to this case it appearing that he is the real contractor with whom&nbsp; Pajares dealt with regard to the construction of his house.<br><br>There is also no merit in petitioner's contention that he was deprived of his day in court during the trial&nbsp; of this case on&nbsp; the&nbsp; merits before the trial court.&nbsp; The incident invoked&nbsp; arose as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; When&nbsp; Pa j ares'&nbsp; counsel was cross-examining&nbsp; Salvador in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with his&nbsp; direct examination, his questions were objected to by Baluyot's counsel to which Pa j ares' counsel objected and the objection sustained by the trial court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such ruling which prevented Baluyot's counsel from objecting to the questions propounded by Pa j ares' counsel is now regarded by petitioner as having the&nbsp; effect of depriving&nbsp; him&nbsp; of his day in&nbsp; court.&nbsp; In&nbsp; our opinion,&nbsp; the ruling was not entirely improper considering that it was the turn of Salvador to present his evidence against defendant Pa j ares and in line with the procedure that should be followed in the trial of a case, it was Salvador's counsel who was called upon to object if he so desired to the questions of Pa j ares' counsel although Baluyot's counsel may also intervene if so allowed by&nbsp; the court in the use of its&nbsp; discretion,&nbsp; but such ruling cannot be considered&nbsp; as having impaired&nbsp; the&nbsp; right of a party to&nbsp; his day in court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much&nbsp; less can be&nbsp; said with regard to Baluyot as a&nbsp; litigant because the record&nbsp; shows that when&nbsp; Pajares offered his evidence,&nbsp; both oral and documentary as against&nbsp; Baluyot, the latter or his counsel, was given the widest latitude in formulating objections to questions propounded to him during his examination and cross-examination.&nbsp; The claim&nbsp; of counsel&nbsp; of Baluyot that he was deprived of his day in court is therefore untenable.<br><br>With regard to the claim that the Court of Appeals erred in sustaining the trial court's judgment ordering petitioner to pay respondent the sum of P700.00 representing Pajares alleged expenses on the cement foundation and the&nbsp; sum of P1,390.00 as reasonable expenses to complete the construction, suffice it to&nbsp; quote what the Court of Appeals says&nbsp; on this point:<br><blockquote>"In going over the evidence of record, we entertain no doubt that third party plaintiff Oscar Pajares is entitled to indemnity&nbsp; or some sort of relief from third party defendant Edilio L. Baluyot who was the real contractor of the house of the former. It had been determined upon investigation conducted by Benjamin L. Abrantes, building inspector of the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of the city engineer of Quezon City, on request of plaintiff,&nbsp; that&nbsp; "the quality&nbsp; of workmanship is poor in general judging by standard construction methods&nbsp; and egineering practice. Connections&nbsp; and joints&nbsp; are&nbsp; not properly constructed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some bolts connecting the posts to the straps&nbsp; have not been tightened in place with nuts, windows&nbsp; cannot be closed with ease and falsity because sashes are warped, indicating the use of unseasoned lumber.&nbsp; Glazed tiles were used for the flooring of the&nbsp; toilet and bath, which is unusual because unglazed type is more proper.&nbsp; Cabinets are unfinished and the finishing of the building proper is roughly done.'&nbsp; And it has further been determined by the commissioner who heard the parties that—<br><br>'To complete the construction of the aforesaid house of Pajares, the following amounts have&nbsp; to be spent: P30.00 for the&nbsp; socale, it being only 80%&nbsp; complete;&nbsp; PI00.00 to smooth the exposed&nbsp; woodwork, 50 work, 50% of&nbsp; the same not being smoothed; P200.00&nbsp; to put the posts on bearing and the framings in order; P500.00 to&nbsp; replace the 2"&nbsp; x 4" joints with those 2" x&nbsp; 5"&nbsp; as called for in the&nbsp; plan (Exh. 41-3—Pajares); P50.00 for the three-quarter moulding on the partitions:&nbsp; P30.00&nbsp; to repair the sagging&nbsp; ceiling; P100.00 to replace twisted&nbsp; windows&nbsp; and doors; P80.00&nbsp; to repair leading roof and gutters; and P300.00 to finish the&nbsp; painting of the house which&nbsp; is only half-done.&nbsp; All&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; expenses total P1,390.00 to which Pajares is&nbsp; entitled against Baluyot.'"<br></blockquote>Since the questions involved in this assignment of error are of fact which involve an evaluation of the evidence, they cannot be entertained by this Court in this appeal. The trial court's award of attorney's&nbsp; fee in the sum of P2,000.00 and the&nbsp; penalty of P5.00 a day for&nbsp; the contractor's&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to complete&nbsp; the job within the&nbsp;&nbsp; stipulated period, we find&nbsp; correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of petitioner's&nbsp; failure to complete the job he bound himself to do through Salvador without any justifiable reason, Pajares was forced to bring this action and engage the services of a lawyer and it is but fair&nbsp; that he&nbsp; be&nbsp; indemnified for&nbsp; such&nbsp; expenses.&nbsp; For the same reason,&nbsp; the penalty of&nbsp; P5.00&nbsp; a day&nbsp; is proper because the same is expressly stipulated in the contract.<br><br>We believe, however, that the award regarding exemplary and moral damages in the sum of P2,000.00&nbsp; is unjustified. There is no clear evidence&nbsp; to show that&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; has acted in bad faith or in "any wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner"&nbsp; (Articles 2220, 2232, new Civil Code).&nbsp; For&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; failure to do his job either personally or through his alter ego, the award for attorney's fees and for the penalty&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; upon in&nbsp; the contract is more than sufficient as a retribution.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, the decision appealed from should&nbsp; be modified.<br><br>Wherefore, with the modification that petitioner should not be made to pay moral and exemplary&nbsp; damages in the amount of P2,000.00, the decision appealed from is affirmed, without&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
