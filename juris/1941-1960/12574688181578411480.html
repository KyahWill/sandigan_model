				<BR><STRONG>PAREDES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On June 24, 1955, in the Municipal Court of Manila, the defendants-appellees 
were charged in an information as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned accuses Benjamin Aguilar y Perez and Jose Oliveros y Olat of 
the crime of multiple slight physical injuries thru reckless imprudence, 
committed as follows:</p>
<p>That on or about the 25th day of April, 1955, in the City of Manila, 
Philippines, the said accused, being then the drivers and persons inchaa-ge of a 
passenger jeepney bearing Plate No. TPU-2271 (Manila), and Liberty taxicab with 
Plate No. 3165 (Rizal), respectively, did then and there unlawfully drive, 
manage and operate their respective vehicles along the corner of Requesens and 
Oroquieta streets, in said city, in a careless, reckless and imprudent manner, 
by then and there giving their respective vehicles a rate of speed greater than 
was reasonable and proper and without taking the necessary precautions to avoid 
accident to persons and damage to property considering the condition of 
vehicular traffic at the time at said place, causing as a consequence of their 
carelessness, recklessness, imprudence and want of precaution the said vehicles 
so driven, managed and operated by them respectively in the manner above set 
forth to bump against and collide with, as they in fact bumped against and 
collided with each other, and as a result of the impact the following passengers 
of the said passenger jeepney 1. Erlinda Saludes y Alfonso, 2. Renato Saludes y 
Alfonso, 3. Rosa Almario (Umali) Amistoso, 4. Leonisa Amistoso and 5. Avelino 
Miranda-sustained physical injuries which have required medical attendance for a 
period of more than one (1) but not more than nine (9) days and which have 
incapacitated them from engaging in their customary labor for the same period of 
time."</p></blockquote>
<p>Motions to Quash the information were presented by the defendants on the 
ground that reckless imprudence is punishable only if the acts complained of 
constitute a grave or less grave felony. The municipal court granted the motion. 
The City Fiscal appealed, and the Court of First Instance of Manila sustained 
the order granting the Motions to Quash and dismissing the case. This is an 
appeal from said order.</p>
<p>The People contends that the trial court erred in dismissing the case on^he 
ground that the facts alleged in the information did not constitute an offense 
and that the law did not provide a penalty therefor. The pertinent portions of 
Article 365 of the Kevised Penal Code, under which the defendants-appellees were 
charged, provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 365. <em>Imprudence and negligence</em>.-Any person who, by reek-less 
imprudence, shall commit any act which, had it been intentional; would 
constitute a grave felony, shall suffer the penalty of <em>arresto mayor</em> in 
its maximum period to <em>prision correctiona</em>l in its minimum period; if it 
would have constituted a less grave felony, the penalty of <em>arresto 
mayor</em> in its minimum and medium periods shall be imposed.</p>
<p>Any person who, by simple imprudence or negligence, shall commit an act which 
would otherwise constitute a grave felony, shall suffer the penalty of 
<em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and maximum periods; if it would have 
constituted a less serious felony, the penalty of <em>arresto mayor</em> in its 
minimum period shall be imposed.</p>
<p>When the execution of the act covered by this article shall have only 
resulted in damage to the property of another, the offender shall be punished by 
a fine ranging from an amount equal to the value of said damages to three times 
such value, but which shall in no case be less than 25 pesos.</p>
<p>A fine not exceeding 200 pesos and censure shall be imposed upon any person 
who, by simple imprudence or negligence, shall cause some wrong which, if done 
maliciously, would have constituted a light felony."</p></blockquote>
<p>The cited provision, therefore, punishes (1) an act by reckless negligence, 
which if intentional, would constitute a grave felony or a less grave felony; 
(2) an act by simple negligence, which if intentional, would constitute a grave 
felony or less grave felony; (3) a negligent*act resulting in the damage of the 
property of another; and (4) an act by simple negligence, which if maliciously 
done, would constitute a light felony. Verily, the article does not include an 
act of reckless imprudence, which if done intentionally, would have constituted 
a light felony, like slight physical injuries. The rule of <em>inclusio unius 
est exclusio alteruis</em> fittingly operates in the present case, and courts 
should not consider as crimes by inference or implication, acts or omissions 
which are not expressly and clearly punishable'by law. In effect, after noticing 
that the Revised Penal Code did not punish slight physical injuries thru 
reckless imprudence, the Legislature, in 1957, filled the hiatus found in 
article 365, by providing the penalty of <em>arresto menor</em> in its maximum 
period, for light felony committed thru reckless imprudence or negligence 
(Republic Act No. 1790, promulgated on June 21, 1957).</p>
<p>This notwithstanding, inasmuch as the information in the case at bar 
heretofore quoted, describes equally reckless and simple negligence, the 
principle enunciated in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Benigno Lingad 103 
Phil., 980; 55 Off. Gaz. (48) 10062, where the accused was prosecuted for slight 
physical injuries thru reckless imprudence, should be similarly made to apply in 
the present case. In that case, this Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. In sustaining the motion to quash, the trial court relied on the 
decision of the Court of Appeals in People vs. Macario Ande y Marino, 51 Off. 
Gaz., p. 5222, wherein it held that 'The law does not declare as a crime and 
does not provide any penalty for the execution of an act-more serious as it 
is-committed thru reckless imprudence which, if intentional, (only) amounts to a 
light felony.' And this decision is predicated on a portion of Article 365&gt; 
of the Revised Penal Code which provides that 'A fine not exceeding 200 pesos 
and censure shall be imposed upon any person who, by <em>simple imprudence or 
negligence</em>, shall cause some wrong which, if done maliciously, would have 
constituted a light felony.'</p>
<p>We have no quarrel with the above citation. The same is in accordance with 
law. But the question is: Bo the acts alleged in the information not fit into 
the framework of said decision, or do they not come under the above quoted 
portion of Art. 365 of the Revised Penal Code?</p>
<p>The answer is obviously in the affirmative if we carefully examine the 
averments of the information. While the information gives the designation of the 
crime as 'slight physical injuries thru reckless imprudence,' the body thereof 
does not specify the kind of negligence or imprudence that qualifies the crime 
charged, for it merely alleges that it was committed 'in a careless, reckless, 
negligent and imprudent manner * * * causing by such careless, recklessness, 
imprudence and lack of precaution,' the collision which resulted in the injury. 
Under such vague allegation of the imprudent act, one may infer that the act may 
have been committed either thru reckless or simple negligence, depending upon 
the nature of the evidence that.may be presented by the prosecution. And even if 
what was intended was to qualify the crime with reckless imprudence, still it 
cannot be said that the same is not punishable by law for it may still be shown 
during the trial that the accused committed the act only thru simple negligence 
upon the theory that what is more or graver includes the less or lighter, in the 
same manner as a serious physical injury includes a slight injury, or robbery 
includes the crime of theft. The question, therefore, in the last analysis may 
boil down to a matter of evidence. In other words, the elements of the two kinds 
of negligence are practically the same, the only difference lies in the degree, 
and this can bte substantiated by proper evidence.</p>
<p>We are, therefore, of the opinion that the trial court erred in sustaining 
the motion to quash and in dismissing the case."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view hereof, we hereby set aside the order appealed from, and direct that 
the case be remanded to the trial court, for hearing on the merits. No 
costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera</em>, and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order set aside.</em></p></div>
