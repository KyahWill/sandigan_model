				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In civil&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 3498 of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Tayabas, the herein appellant Josefa R. Qppus sued the&nbsp; herein M administrator of the intestate estate of the deceased Florentino San&nbsp; Gil for the possession, among others, of the following personalties:&nbsp; 24 beds, 1 "Schkler" piano, 12 chairs, 8 small tables, 2 iceboxes, 1 phonograph,&nbsp; 2 long dining tables, and 1&nbsp; big mirror. On&nbsp; November 1, 1933, the&nbsp; court in said case rendered judgment ordering the defendant to deliver the possession&nbsp; of said furniture to the plaintiff,&nbsp;&nbsp; For reasons&nbsp; that do not appear in the&nbsp;&nbsp; record, that&nbsp; judgment has not been satisfied.&nbsp; On October 6, 1939, Josefa R.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oppus presented a motion&nbsp; in the above-entitled intestate proceeding of Florentino&nbsp;&nbsp; San Gil, asking the court to order the administrator Bonifacio San Gil to deliver&nbsp; to&nbsp; her&nbsp; the furniture above&nbsp; mentioned,&nbsp; The probate court denied said motion on&nbsp; the grounds (1) that the furniture in question does not belong to the estate of the deceased Florentino San Gil and (2) that in any&nbsp; event the execution of the judgment in civil&nbsp; case No. 3498 should be applied for in said case.&nbsp; We are now asked to review and reverse that order.<br><br>The first ground&nbsp; stated by the probate court is correct because it was established in said&nbsp; civil case No. 3498 that the furniture in question belongs&nbsp; to&nbsp; the appellant Josefa R. Oppus, who bought it from&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased Florentino San Gil.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; second&nbsp; ground is also well founded because the administrator Bonifacio San Gil&nbsp; having been sued as such in the ordinary&nbsp; court and judgment having been rendered&nbsp; there against him,&nbsp; we find no legal impediment to the execution of said&nbsp; judgment by order of the court that rendered&nbsp; it.&nbsp; Appellant's contention that she has&nbsp; to apply to the probate court for the execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; said judgment on the theory&nbsp;&nbsp; that the property in&nbsp; question is <span style="font-style: italic;">in custodia&nbsp; legis,</span> is untenable.&nbsp; The&nbsp; judgment in&nbsp; question is not one for a sum&nbsp; of money&nbsp; which has to be satisfied by levying execution on property&nbsp; belonging to the estate&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore <i>in custodia legis</i>. It is a&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; for the manual delivery and&nbsp; possession of specific articles&nbsp; of personal property, the action for&nbsp; which&nbsp; survives by express&nbsp; provision of law "and may be&nbsp; commenced and prosecuted by or against&nbsp; the executor or administrator."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section 703, Code of Civil Procedure; section 1, Rule&nbsp; 88, Rules of Court.)&nbsp; On the one hand, the prosecution of an action against an&nbsp; executor or administrator&nbsp; which the law allows regarding the possession of specific articles, necessarily includes the execution of the judgment that may be entered&nbsp; in said action.&nbsp; On the other hand, once the court determines in such action that the property in litigation&nbsp; belongs&nbsp; to the plaintiff and not to the estate of the deceased, it cannot&nbsp; be maintained that such property is <i>in custodia legis</i>, it not forming part of the estate of the deceased. Hence appellant's motion herein was not in order and was properly&nbsp; denied.<br><br>We might add&nbsp; that perhaps such motion in the probate court was resorted&nbsp; to instead of a petition&nbsp; for execution in the ordinary court that&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; the judgment, because more&nbsp; than&nbsp; five&nbsp; years had elapsed since it became final in December, 1933.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffice&nbsp; it&nbsp; to&nbsp; say,&nbsp; however, that what the law does not permit to be done directly cannot be done indirectly.<br><br>Lastly, we&nbsp; observe&nbsp; from the record (p. 37, B. of E.) that twice did appellant procure writs&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution&nbsp; in said case No. 3498â€”first in February, 1934, and again&nbsp; in September,&nbsp; 1935. We cannot understand why the judgment in question has remained unsatisfied.<br><br>The order appealed&nbsp; from is affirmed; but we refrain from awarding costs to the appellee because we think his obstinate refusal to deliver the furniture in question to the appellant notwithstanding the judgment&nbsp; of a&nbsp; competent tribunal&nbsp; is unjustifiable&nbsp; and unworthy of a law-abiding citizen.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Yulo, C. J., Moran</i> and <i>Bocobo, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1"><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING</span><br></div><br>PARAS J.,<br><br>The appellant may be the owner of the Personalties in question and yet the same may be <i>in custidia legis</i> if the&nbsp; appellee has possession thereof as administrator.<br><br>The judgment in civil case No. 3498 is of doubtful collusiveness.&nbsp; When the defendant administrator in said case alleged that the personalties belonged to one Damasa Melendres, the&nbsp; latter should have been included as party defendant.&nbsp; It is important to observe that the children of the&nbsp; intestate,&nbsp; Florentino&nbsp; San&nbsp; Gil,&nbsp; are claiming ownership&nbsp; and&nbsp; possession not through&nbsp; inheritance from the latter, but by virtue of a donation from Damasa Melendres who is alleged to have bought the controverted&nbsp; properties from Florentino San Gil.&nbsp; Although the validity of this sale was not upheld in a later case (No.&nbsp; 4295 of the Court of First Instance of Tayabas),&nbsp;&nbsp; there was an appeal pending at the&nbsp; time the assailed order was issued.</div>
