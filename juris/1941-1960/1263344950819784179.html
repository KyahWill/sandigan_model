				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff has appealed from the order of Judge Jose N.&nbsp; Leuterio of the Nueva&nbsp; Ecija court of&nbsp; first&nbsp; instance, dismissing his&nbsp; complaint whereby&nbsp; he&nbsp; had asked that defendant be required to vacate&nbsp; a parcel of land and to pay damages.&nbsp; The dismissal rested&nbsp; on&nbsp; two grounds,&nbsp; (a) the&nbsp; case&nbsp; pertained to the Court of Agrarian Relations; and (b) as attorney-in-fact&nbsp; of the true owner of the land, the plaintiff had&nbsp; no right to bring the action.<br><br>The record discloses that&nbsp; on February 4, 1957, Ceferino Marcelo,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in the justice&nbsp; of the peace&nbsp; court of&nbsp; San Antonio,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija,&nbsp; a&nbsp; complaint to recover possession of a lot of 2,000 square meters&nbsp; belonging to Severino P. Marcelo&nbsp; (who had given him a full power-of-attorney) which was held by defendant "on the understanding that one-half of all&nbsp; the products raised in the occupied area, would be given" to the landowner.&nbsp; The complaint alleged that&nbsp; after plaintiff&nbsp; had&nbsp; assumed the&nbsp; administration of Severino&nbsp; Marcelo's properties,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; delivered the products corresponding to the owner; but&nbsp; when in September 1956, plaintiff notified defendant that in addition to giving half of the produce, he&nbsp; would have to&nbsp; pay a rental of two&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; per month,&nbsp; the latter refused, and continued refusing to pay such additional charges. Wherefore, complainant prayed for judgment ordering defendant to leave the premises and to&nbsp; pay damages and&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>The defendant&nbsp; questioned&nbsp; the&nbsp; court's jurisdiction,&nbsp; arguing&nbsp; that the matter involved&nbsp; tenancy relations falling within&nbsp; the&nbsp; authority of&nbsp; the Agrarian Court; he&nbsp; also challenged the capacity of plaintiff to sue.&nbsp; He lost in the justice of the peace court; however, on appeal to the court of first instance, he raised the same issues on a motion to dismiss, and then his views prevailed. <br><br>In this&nbsp; appeal, plaintiff insists he merely filed ejectment or detainer proceedings,&nbsp; which fall within&nbsp; the justice&nbsp; of the peace court's jurisdiction.&nbsp; He claims&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot to be residential,&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; not&nbsp; agricultural.&nbsp; On&nbsp; this&nbsp; point, His Honor noted that "the land covered by the title of plain tiff's&nbsp; principal covers&nbsp; an area of 59,646&nbsp; square meters situated in the barrio of San Mariano, San Antonio,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija.&nbsp; This land obviously is agricultural, and it is too much to presume that barrio folks would occupy an area of 2,000 square meters more or less of land for a residence. The cultivation&nbsp; of the land by the defendant and the sharing of the&nbsp; products&nbsp; thereof with the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the land characterize the&nbsp; relationship between the&nbsp; defendant and the plaintiff's principal as one of landlord and tenant."<br><br>Indeed, from the allegations of the complaint, one could conclude&nbsp; that defendant&nbsp; had&nbsp; physical possession of the land for the purpose of cultivating it and giving the owner a share in the crop.&nbsp; This was agricultural tenancy of the kind called "share tenancy".&nbsp; In judging this relationship, the 2-pesos-a-month-rental alleged in the complaint may be&nbsp; disregarded,&nbsp; because&nbsp; defendant never&nbsp; having&nbsp; agreed to such imposition, it may not be held a part of the compensation payable for holding the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstance that defendant built a dwelling on the agricultural lot does not <i>ipso facto</i>&nbsp; make&nbsp; it&nbsp; residential—considering specially that the dwelling—photograph submitted with brief—does not occupy more than 80 square meters of the 2,000 square meters occupied by him.<br><br>In this connection,&nbsp; plaintiff argues as follows: <br><blockquote>"The defendant does not&nbsp; till or cultivate the land in order to grow the fruit bearing trees because they are already full grown. He&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; even&nbsp; do the&nbsp; actual&nbsp; gathering of the&nbsp; fruits. He merely&nbsp; supervises the&nbsp; gathering, and after deducting the expenses, he gives one-half of the&nbsp; fruits&nbsp; to the plaintiff all in consideration of his&nbsp; stay in the land. He is not, therefore, a tenant&nbsp; within the&nbsp; meaning&nbsp; of that term as used&nbsp; in Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1199 for 'A tenant shall mean a&nbsp; person&nbsp; who, himself and with the aid available&nbsp; from within his immediate farm&nbsp; household, cultivate the land for purposes of production .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .'"<br></blockquote>Anyone&nbsp; who has had&nbsp; fruit trees in his yard, will disagree&nbsp; with the above description of the relationship.&nbsp; He knows the caretaker must water the trees,&nbsp; even fertilize them for better production, uproot weeds and turn the soil, sometimes fumigate to eliminate plant pests,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; Those chores obviously mean "working or cultivating" the land. Besides, it seems&nbsp; that defendant <i>planted&nbsp; other crops,</i> (i. e. cultivated the lot) giving the landowner&nbsp; his corresponding share. <br><br>Now, the&nbsp; statutes provide that 'All cases involving dispossession of a&nbsp; tenant by the&nbsp; landholder * *&nbsp; * shall be under&nbsp; the original and exclusive jurisdiction&nbsp; of such court as may&nbsp; now or hereafter be&nbsp; authorized by law to&nbsp; take cognizance&nbsp; of tenancy relations and&nbsp; disputes". Sec.&nbsp; 2, Republic Act 1199); and the court&nbsp; (Agrarian Relations) "shall&nbsp; have original and&nbsp; exclusive jurisdiction to consider, investigate,&nbsp; decide&nbsp; and&nbsp; settle all&nbsp; questions and matters involving all those&nbsp; relationships established by law which determine the varying rights&nbsp; of persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land where one of the parties works the land'".&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sec. 7, Republic&nbsp; Act 1267 as amended by Republic Act 1409.)<br><br>In Tumbagan <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Vasquez, Lr-8719, July 17, 1956, we impliedly held that where a farmhand occupies agricultural land and erects a house thereon, the tenancy relationship continues subject to tenancy laws—not to those governing leases. <br><br>In fact, the Agricultural&nbsp; Tenancy Law (Republic Act 1199) requires the landholder to give his tenant an area wherein the latter may construct his dwelling (sec. 26), of&nbsp; course without thereby changing the nature&nbsp; of their relationship,&nbsp; from landowner and tenant to&nbsp; lessor and lessee. <br><br>At any rate,&nbsp; this action&nbsp; must fail&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; second ground of defendant's&nbsp; motion to dismiss: the&nbsp; plaintiff is a&nbsp; mere&nbsp; <i>apoderado</i> of&nbsp; the owner,' Severino&nbsp; P. Marcelo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The rule is that every action must&nbsp; be&nbsp; prosecuted&nbsp; in the name of the real party in interest,&nbsp; (sec. 2, Rule 3). <br><br>However, plaintiff quotes that part of sec. 1 of Rule 72, permitting "the&nbsp; legal representative" of&nbsp; any landlord to bring an action of ejectment, and insists in his right now to litigate.&nbsp; Supposing that "legal representative" as used in sec. 1, includes attorneys-in-fact, we find that plaintiff's power attached to the complaint, authorizes him to sue for and <i>in the name</i> of Severino Marcelo, to "pursue&nbsp; any and all&nbsp; kinds of suits and actions for me and <i>in my name</i> in the courts of the land".&nbsp; This action is not <i>in the&nbsp; name</i> of plaintiff's principal.<br><br>For all the foregoing, the appealed&nbsp; order is&nbsp; affirmed with costs chargeable against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Concepcion, Endencia,</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup> Arroyo <i>vs.</i> Granda,&nbsp; 18 Phil., 484; Hilario <i>vs.</i> La Congregacion, 27 Phil., 593.</div>
