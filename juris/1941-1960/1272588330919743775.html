				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners&nbsp; are employees and&nbsp; laborers of the Master Shirt&nbsp; Company&nbsp; and members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Kapisanan ng Mga Manggagawa ng&nbsp; Damit&nbsp; labor union, On April 24, 1955, petitioners, with&nbsp; other workers&nbsp; affiliated with the Kapisanan ng Mga Manggagawa&nbsp; ng Damit,&nbsp; after&nbsp; a protest against the unjust dismissal made by the factory management&nbsp; of one Amelia Sumulong declared a strike, and as a consequence thereof,&nbsp; placed&nbsp; a&nbsp; picket line outside the factory compound. On&nbsp; May&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1955, respondents, also workers of&nbsp; the same shirt company&nbsp; and members of a rival union, the Samahan ng Mga Manggagawa sa Master Shirt&nbsp; Company, brought suit before the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila asking for&nbsp; the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of a writ of preliminary injunction; and&nbsp; on the same&nbsp; date,&nbsp; without previous hearing and&nbsp; on the basis alone of&nbsp; sworn&nbsp; affidavits submitted by the&nbsp; respondents, the Court of First Instance issued the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; prayed for, stating&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasons therefor in his order of May 10, 1955 as follows:<blockquote>&nbsp;"The plaintiffs, in&nbsp; a verified complaint,&nbsp; alleged that,they are non-striking employees of the Master&nbsp; Shirt Factory who,&nbsp; among other things, were prevented through acts of coercion and violence by the defendants from taking their meals at the factory, which they have chosen as their&nbsp; temporary&nbsp; home during the pendency of the strike. Affidavits showing the defendants' unlawful&nbsp; conduct in intercepting the food supplies being delivered to the plaintiffs and the defendants' employment of force&nbsp; and intimidation to prevent&nbsp; any breaking through their&nbsp; picketline, were attached to the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; <p>The&nbsp; plaintiffs made it&nbsp; clear that&nbsp; unless&nbsp; a restraining order&nbsp; is issued&nbsp; by this court they&nbsp; would&nbsp; not&nbsp; be able to pursue their means of livelihood and possibly starve.&nbsp; In the face of&nbsp; such appeal the court cannot&nbsp; simply folds its arms&nbsp; and&nbsp; do&nbsp; nothing to prevent a party from&nbsp; exercising a very human right—to eat.</p><p>This court believes that while picketing is an extension&nbsp; of the right to free&nbsp; speech, it should not&nbsp; be exercised so as to deprive others&nbsp; of their right to eat and, consequently, to&nbsp; live.&nbsp; The right to live&nbsp; is a right to which&nbsp; everyone is entitled, regardless of whether he is an employer or an employee,&nbsp; a striker&nbsp; or non-striker, and under our&nbsp; system of government no one is above the law and everyone is entitled to its equal protection.</p><p>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing consideration,&nbsp; the court hereby&nbsp; orders that, upon the filing&nbsp; by the plaintiffs of a bond&nbsp; in the amount of P10,000&nbsp; to&nbsp; answer for whatever damage&nbsp; that may occur to the defendants&nbsp; and pending the determination of the merits of the complaint, the defendants, their attorneys, agents&nbsp; or representatives should immediately—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(<em>a</em>) refrain and desist from obstructing, stopping, blocking, coercing, intimidating, or in any way or manner preventing the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; and other co-employees&nbsp; from going&nbsp; in&nbsp; and out of the above-mentioned&nbsp; factory&nbsp; in pursuance of&nbsp; their&nbsp; word and .livelihood;</p><p>(<em>b</em>) refrain and desist from obstructing, stopping, blocking, coercing, intimidating, or in any way or manner preventing or hampering any and&nbsp; all deliveries of food and&nbsp; other necessities for the plaintiffs and all&nbsp; deliveries&nbsp; of goods&nbsp; or merchandise&nbsp; on which the plaintiffs work in pursuance&nbsp; of their livelihood;&nbsp; </p><p>(<em>c</em>) refrain&nbsp; and&nbsp; desist from&nbsp; any, all&nbsp; or&nbsp; similar unlawful acts heretofore&nbsp; committed&nbsp; and&nbsp; threatened&nbsp; to&nbsp; be committed against the plaintiffs."&nbsp; (Annex "A", Petition.) <br></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The&nbsp; next day,&nbsp; May&nbsp; 11, 1955,&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; moved&nbsp; to&nbsp; dissolve the injunction, challenging the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the court&nbsp; in&nbsp; issuing&nbsp; the&nbsp; same on the&nbsp; ground that under Republic Act No. 875, the Court of Industrial Relations has exclusive&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to issue&nbsp; writs of&nbsp; preliminary injunctions in labor&nbsp; disputes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent judge denied petitioners&nbsp; motion to dismiss;&nbsp; wherefore,&nbsp; they filed&nbsp; this petition for certiorari&nbsp; and prohibition before this Court.</p><p>The&nbsp; main issue&nbsp; raised by petitioners&nbsp; is&nbsp; the jurisdiction of the respondent judge&nbsp; in issuing the injunction in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; question&nbsp; of&nbsp; whether or not the ordinary courts&nbsp; can issue injunctions in labor disputes has&nbsp; been recently decided by us in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of PAFLU <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Hon. Bienvenido&nbsp; Tan,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.&nbsp; (supra, p. 854), promulgated August 31,&nbsp; 1956, wherein we held that&nbsp; by the&nbsp; passage of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875,&nbsp; the&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; limited to the&nbsp; following cases:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"(1)&nbsp; when the labor dispute affects an industry which is indispensable to the national interest and is so certified by the President to the&nbsp; industrial court&nbsp; (Section 10, Republic Act No, 875);&nbsp; (2) when the controversy refers to minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act No. 602); (3) when it involves hours of employment under&nbsp; the Bight-Hour Labor Law&nbsp; (Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 464); and (4)&nbsp; when it involves an unfair labor&nbsp; practice (Section 5[a], Republic Act No. 875)";</blockquote><p>and that in&nbsp; all other cases involving&nbsp; labor disputes&nbsp; not falling within the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the Industrial Court above enumerated, it is&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinary courts of&nbsp; justice who have the power to issue injunctions.</p><p>There&nbsp; are,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; admissions&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case by both parties that the acts&nbsp; against&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; injunction in question&nbsp; was obtained&nbsp; constitute unfair&nbsp; labor practices (Petition, p. 4; Answer, p. 9).&nbsp; If we are to go by these admissions,&nbsp; then&nbsp; the&nbsp; application&nbsp; for&nbsp; injunction would have been exclusively cognizable by the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; and&nbsp; beyond the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the respondent Court of First&nbsp; Instance.</p><p>On the other hand, assuming that the respondent court had jurisdiction, the injunction issued by it is nevertheless void because the procedure laid down by section 9&nbsp; (<em>d</em>) of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 875 was not followed in its issuance. Respondents argue that they&nbsp; did&nbsp; not comply with&nbsp; said procedure because&nbsp; they sought out the injunction under section 6, Rule 60&nbsp; of the Rules of Court and not under the&nbsp; provisions of Republic Act No. 875.&nbsp; This argument has, however, already been ruled out by us in the same case of PAFLU <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tan case, <em>supra,</em> where we said:</p><blockquote><p>"We believe however&nbsp; that in order that an injunction&nbsp; may be properly issued the procedure laid down&nbsp; in section 9(<em>d</em>) of Republic Act No. 875 should be followed and cannot be granted <em>ex parte</em> as allowed by&nbsp; Rule 60, section 6,&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of .Court.&nbsp; The reason is that the case,&nbsp; involving as it does a labor dispute, comes Tinder&nbsp; said section 9(<em>d</em>)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law.&nbsp;&nbsp; That procedure requires that there should be a hearing at' which the&nbsp; parties should be given an&nbsp; opportunity for cross-examination, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the other conditions required by said section as prerequisites for the granting of relief must be&nbsp; established and stated in the order of the court. Unless this procedure is followed,&nbsp; the proceedings would be invalid and of no effect.&nbsp; The court would&nbsp; then be acting in excess of its jurisdiction."</p></blockquote><p>Under section 9 (<em>d</em>) of Republic Act No. 875, an injunction <em>ex parte </em>can be issued only "upon testimony under oath, sufficient,&nbsp; if sustained, to&nbsp; justify the court in issuing a temporary&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; upon hearing&nbsp; after&nbsp; notice".&nbsp;&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words, there&nbsp; is&nbsp; still&nbsp; necessity&nbsp; for a hearing at which sworn testimony for the&nbsp; applicants&nbsp; would be&nbsp; received, and&nbsp; not only that, the&nbsp; court should be&nbsp; satisfied that such&nbsp; testimony would stand under cross-examination by the Court and be sufficient&nbsp; to overcome&nbsp; denial by the defendants.&nbsp; As no hearing was&nbsp; held in the Court below and the injunction issued on the basis of mere affidavits submitted&nbsp; by respondents&nbsp; (petitioners-applicants&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court below), the&nbsp; injunction in&nbsp; question&nbsp; is void for not having been issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875.</p><p>It&nbsp; should be noted&nbsp; that even if the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; had been properly issued, the express statutory provision is to the effect that a temporary restraining&nbsp; order&nbsp; issued <em>ex parte</em> "shall be&nbsp; effective for no longer&nbsp; than five days and shall become void at the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of said five days" (also section 9&nbsp; (<em>d</em>), Republic Act No. 875).&nbsp;&nbsp; The injunction in question,&nbsp; having been&nbsp; issued ex parte, therefore&nbsp; became void and of no effect after&nbsp; the fifth day of its issuance, by operation of law and without any further&nbsp; need of judicial pronouncement.</p><p>The petition&nbsp; for certiorari is granted and the writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent judge is declared null and void,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against respondent workers Victoria&nbsp; Gonzales, et al.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.
