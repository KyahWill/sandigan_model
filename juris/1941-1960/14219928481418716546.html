Shortly after Bernabe Villalon, the <i>cochero</i>&nbsp; of the calesa had&nbsp; steppe'd down and gone toward a store to take some coffee,&nbsp; the&nbsp; calesa with its occupants and the horse became the target of&nbsp; a concentrated murderous gunfire from in front and behind, resulting in . the death of Alberto Agaran&nbsp; and&nbsp; Jaime Canary and the serious wounding of Lorenzo.&nbsp; Romeo jumped&nbsp; down from the calesa, ran northward and then turned right on Kapulong Street, but was intercepted and stabbed in the neck by Celso&nbsp; Carillo, one&nbsp; of the assailants purposely stationed&nbsp; there to&nbsp; cut of all&nbsp; escape of&nbsp; the&nbsp; victims.&nbsp; The calesa&nbsp; was riddled&nbsp; with bullets, and even&nbsp; the horse was not spared,&nbsp; having received two gunshots.<br><br>For&nbsp; the death&nbsp; of Alberto,&nbsp; the following persons were accused of murder&nbsp; in band in Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 27149, namely: Soriano&nbsp; Alcaraz y Licuanan <i>alias</i>&nbsp; Ano, Amando Santos y Quinto alias Amading, Melchor Martinez y Licuanan alms Melchor, Carlos Espino y Alcaraz <i>alias</i>&nbsp; Carling, Manuel Samonte&nbsp; y Soriano,&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Halili&nbsp; y&nbsp; Alcaraz,&nbsp; Ambrosio&nbsp; Diaz&nbsp; y Dimandal, Santos Cruz, Elino Manzano&nbsp; y Cabansag alias Totoy Manzano alias Totoy&nbsp; Eje, Celso Carillo y Sangca, Moises Halili, William Doe, Peter&nbsp; Doe, and Joseph&nbsp; Doe.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the death&nbsp; of Jaime Canary, the same persons were accused of murder in band in Criminal Case No.&nbsp; 27150.&nbsp; For the wounding of Lorenzo&nbsp; Canary, the same&nbsp; individuals were&nbsp; charged with frustrated murder in band in&nbsp; Criminal&nbsp; Case No. 27165, and&nbsp; for the wounding of Romeo Canary, the same men&nbsp; were&nbsp; accused of&nbsp; frustrated&nbsp; murder&nbsp; in&nbsp; band in Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 27166.&nbsp; Before trial, Elino Manzano was killed in a gun battle with the police that tried to arrest him on&nbsp; June 3, 1954.&nbsp; Ambrosio Diaz&nbsp; was discharged&nbsp; from&nbsp; the informations in the four&nbsp; cases and&nbsp; utilized as a witness&nbsp; for the prosecution.&nbsp; For the reason that William Doe,&nbsp; Peter Doe and&nbsp; Joseph Doe,&nbsp; the three&nbsp; last named accused, had&nbsp; not been apprehended or identified, they were not included in the trial of&nbsp; the&nbsp; four&nbsp;&nbsp; cases.&nbsp; After the&nbsp; joint trial,&nbsp; the lower court&nbsp; finding the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of alibi interposed by Moises&nbsp; Halili, Amando Santos and Melchor&nbsp; Martinez to be well&nbsp; founded, acquitted them in&nbsp; each of the four cases.

They also denied having attended&nbsp; a meeting under the house of Moises Halili shortly before the shooting.<br><br>"All put up&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of alibi.&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Samonte testified that he was on a drinking&nbsp; spree with friends from 8&nbsp; to past&nbsp; 10 o'clock on&nbsp; the night of the quadruple&nbsp; offense.&nbsp; Celso Carillo&nbsp; stated that&nbsp; he was&nbsp; in his&nbsp; house&nbsp; at No. 1407, interior, Bankusay.&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Halili claimed that he was&nbsp; in his father's house at No.&nbsp; 1452 Bankusay, Soriano Alcaraz, too,&nbsp; was&nbsp; at&nbsp; home, asleep, at No. 1453 Bankusay, according to him.&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; Cruz and Carlos Espino said&nbsp; that they were on&nbsp; Kaxa&nbsp; Bago&nbsp; Street,&nbsp; the first playing panguingue in the house of a sister, and the&nbsp; second playing ping-pong with&nbsp; a friend in another house.&nbsp; Melchor Martinez,&nbsp; a fisherman&nbsp; by&nbsp; occupation, was&nbsp; fishing in Manila Bay,&nbsp; according to&nbsp; his testimony,&nbsp; Amando Santos told&nbsp; the court&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was&nbsp; with a friend in a night spot known as&nbsp; the Yellow Bar in Culi-Culi,&nbsp;&nbsp; Paranaque,&nbsp; Rizal.&nbsp; And Moises Halili presented evidence, oral and documentary,&nbsp; to&nbsp; show that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; at&nbsp; the City Jail&nbsp; bailing put three detention&nbsp; prisoners.<br><br>"The&nbsp; court&nbsp; will first&nbsp; consider&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of&nbsp; Moises&nbsp; Halili, Amando&nbsp; Santos and&nbsp; Melchor&nbsp; Martinez.<br><br>"The alibi of&nbsp; Moises Halili is well supported by both documentary and oral evidence, including the testimony&nbsp; of policemen&nbsp; which the court cannot&nbsp; lightly&nbsp; disregard.&nbsp; The testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Amando Santos that he was in&nbsp; the Yellow Bar in&nbsp; Culi-culi&nbsp; is fully corroborated by the&nbsp; testimony of&nbsp; Ismael Javier and that, of Romeo&nbsp; Canary&nbsp; who, testifying&nbsp; as a witness&nbsp; for the prosecution, stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; saw Santos&nbsp; in&nbsp; a passenger jeep&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; shooting;&nbsp; that Santos&nbsp; even invited&nbsp; him to go with&nbsp; him to Culi-culi for a good&nbsp; time but that he declined the&nbsp; invitation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly,&nbsp; Melehor Martinez&nbsp; testified that he was&nbsp; fishing in his own banea in Manila Bay, and Romeo&nbsp; Canary, also testifying for the prosecution, admitted&nbsp; that he did not&nbsp; see&nbsp; him at&nbsp; the&nbsp; scene&nbsp; of the&nbsp; shooting.&nbsp; Nowhere, furthermore, is he mentioned in Exhibits X, X-l and X-2.<br><br>"There is testimony that&nbsp; Ambrosio Piaz was taken to&nbsp; the house of Melchor Martinez&nbsp; after the shooting.&nbsp; Assuming; this to&nbsp; be true, Martinez' failure to&nbsp; report to the&nbsp; authorities when he found Diaz in his house as&nbsp; he came home at midnight would not make him an accessory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Diaz, who left for&nbsp; Bulacan&nbsp; the&nbsp; following morning",&nbsp; did not&nbsp; even&nbsp; mention him&nbsp; as&nbsp; having participated in the&nbsp; discussion of the plan to surrender him to the authorities.<br><br>"Neither is Moises Halili an accessory,&nbsp; even if&nbsp; he&nbsp; took&nbsp; part in the discussion to surrender Diaz&nbsp; to the authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Diaz&nbsp; was not hidden in his&nbsp; house and the&nbsp; evidence does not show that&nbsp; he helped Soriano Alcaraz take Diaz to the&nbsp; house of Melchnr Martinez. "The&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; leave&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp;&nbsp; against&nbsp; Soriano&nbsp; Alcaraz, Carlos&nbsp; Bspino,&nbsp; Manuel Samonte,&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Halili,&nbsp;&nbsp; Santos&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp;&nbsp; and Celso Carillo&nbsp; for consideration.<br><br>"The&nbsp; court at&nbsp; the outset discounts&nbsp; the&nbsp; explanation&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Romeo Canary for&nbsp; his&nbsp; presence&nbsp; and&nbsp; that of&nbsp; his&nbsp; brothers&nbsp; and&nbsp; Alberto Agaran in the neighborhood&nbsp; of Bankusay on the night of May 19, 1954. In the first place,&nbsp; Romeo Canary testified that it was&nbsp; his understanding with Jose Halili that' Kalili would notify&nbsp; him when the pigs were available.&nbsp;&nbsp; He. also&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that he had no previous agreement with&nbsp; his brothers for the latter to go&nbsp; to him&nbsp; for&nbsp; the pigs that night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet they and&nbsp; Carlos Espino&nbsp; went to his house at the same time, allegedly for&nbsp; the same purpose.&nbsp; In the second place, the night was quite&nbsp; advanced.&nbsp; Traveling1 merchants do&nbsp; not bring their commodities into the city&nbsp; or transact business&nbsp; at that&nbsp; unholy hour. Traveling hog dealers&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; no exception.&nbsp; Considering&nbsp; the background of the men who&nbsp; played&nbsp; parts in the bloody drama&nbsp; that followed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; is&nbsp; inclined to&nbsp; think, that the&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; the trip of the Canary brothers and Agaran to Bankusay was&nbsp; connected with some shady deal, as Jose Halili told&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court.<br><br>"Too,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court is not convinced that a meeting&nbsp; was held under the&nbsp; house of&nbsp; Moises&nbsp; Halili&nbsp; immediately preceding&nbsp; the&nbsp; shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; Cruz and&nbsp; Celso Carillo in their confessions Exhibits J and LL,&nbsp; respectively,&nbsp; denied attending&nbsp; such meeting&nbsp; and&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that they were called directly to the scene of the shooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruz makes mention of it' in his confession, but he&nbsp; adds that he did not attend it and was only told of it.<br><br>"Moreover, Romeo&nbsp; Canary&nbsp; and&nbsp; Rernabe&nbsp; Villalon&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that the calcsa reached as far north on Rankusay as Kapulong.&nbsp; Moises Halili's house on Bankusay is the second on the east from&nbsp; Kapulong (see Exhibits&nbsp; X,&nbsp; X-I&nbsp; and X-2), and&nbsp; Canary&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; he saw the upper floor of the&nbsp; house lighted.&nbsp; If there was&nbsp; a meeting going on&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; house the passengers of&nbsp; the&nbsp; calesa&nbsp; would&nbsp; not have failed to notice it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>"The court, however, is convinced that by and large the&nbsp; testimony of Romeo Canary, Ambrosio Diaz and Rernabe Villalon on the events immediately&nbsp; preceding, during&nbsp; and after the shooting is true.&nbsp; The court is also satisfied&nbsp; that the respective participations of Santos Cruz, Carlos Espino,&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Samonte, Celso&nbsp; Carillo,&nbsp; Jose Halili and&nbsp; Soriano Alcaraz as described by&nbsp; Diaz and&nbsp; Canary&nbsp; are&nbsp; substantially correct.<br><br>"Diaz' testimony on the identities of&nbsp; the defendants and the&nbsp; participation&nbsp; of each&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; attack,&nbsp; corroborates the confessions&nbsp; of Samonte, Cruz and Carillo,&nbsp; Exhibits I, J and LL.&nbsp; Discounting their attempts to&nbsp; minimize their&nbsp; participations, and Samonte's effort&nbsp; to implicate all&nbsp; the persons suspected by the police, obviously to impress them and the fiscal&nbsp; of his usefulness as witness for&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution, the court believes that these declarants&nbsp; in the main told&nbsp; the truth in their respective&nbsp; confessions.<br><br>"It is&nbsp; true that Samonte, Cruz&nbsp; and Carillo on&nbsp; the witness stand repudiated their confessions and&nbsp; stated that the statements therein attributed to them were not&nbsp; made&nbsp; by them, the same having been&nbsp;&nbsp; allegedly typed by the&nbsp; police without their intervention,&nbsp; but&nbsp; if their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; is true the inclusion&nbsp; therein&nbsp; of&nbsp; statements which&nbsp; run&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counter&nbsp; to the theory&nbsp; of the&nbsp; police and&nbsp; which in&nbsp; a&nbsp; sense&nbsp; weaken&nbsp;&nbsp; the confessions, finds&nbsp; no logical explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denied having attended a meeting under the house of Moises Halili&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; stated that he&nbsp; was not sure&nbsp; if he saw Amando Santos that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carillo,&nbsp; too, denied&nbsp; attending&nbsp; the&nbsp; meeting&nbsp; and&nbsp; fails&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name some of&nbsp; his co-defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>"Carillo, moreover,&nbsp; led&nbsp; detectives&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; hiding place&nbsp; of&nbsp; the dagger&nbsp;&nbsp; used&nbsp; in stabbing&nbsp; Romeo&nbsp; Canary.&nbsp; The&nbsp; dagger,&nbsp; Exhibit Y, was&nbsp; recovered where&nbsp; he hid it and upon&nbsp; his indication and&nbsp; was found to be stained with&nbsp; human&nbsp; blood, according to&nbsp; tests made by&nbsp; the chemist&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; criminal investigation laboratory&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Manila Police&nbsp; Department.&nbsp; (Exhibit Y-l.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Carillo's confession is thus corroborated&nbsp; not&nbsp; only&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony of&nbsp; Ambrosio Diaz and Romeo Canary but also by the recovery of the dagger used in the&nbsp; stabbing and the chemical tests&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; stains on&nbsp; the weapon.<br><br>Carillo's&nbsp; explanation&nbsp; on the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; stand&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect that he might have patted&nbsp; a wounded&nbsp; foot&nbsp; or leg&nbsp; with the&nbsp; dagger&nbsp; to stop bleeding,&nbsp; thus staining it with his own blood, stretches one's credulity&nbsp; and&nbsp; deserves no&nbsp; serious&nbsp; thought.&nbsp; Dr. Rizalino&nbsp; de&nbsp; la Fuento testified that Canary's&nbsp; wound on the neck was lacerated and not&nbsp; incised, thus ruling out&nbsp; the&nbsp; dagger&nbsp; as&nbsp; the weapon&nbsp; used, but this conclusion is&nbsp; undoutedly&nbsp; due to the&nbsp; doctor's perfunctory&nbsp; observation&nbsp; because he was more interested in saving the life&nbsp; of the wounded&nbsp; man,&nbsp; than in the&nbsp; medico-legal aspect of the wound.<br><br>"Lastly, if&nbsp; Samonte did&nbsp; not make the&nbsp; statements attributed to him in Exhibit I, he&nbsp; gave&nbsp; no&nbsp; satisfactory explanation why,&nbsp; on June 6,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; five&nbsp; days before he gave his&nbsp; confession,&nbsp; he&nbsp; asked to be taken to Major Enrique&nbsp; Morales, the chief of the&nbsp; Secret Service of the Manila Police Department,&nbsp; to tell Major Morales all that he knew or pretended to know of the shooting.&nbsp; Before the motion for&nbsp; his&nbsp; exclusion&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; informations was&nbsp; presented he&nbsp; undoubtedly assured&nbsp; the fiscal that he&nbsp; would testify against his&nbsp; codefendants. Of&nbsp; course,&nbsp; he&nbsp; later&nbsp; testified in-&nbsp; his&nbsp; defense,&nbsp; after the court denied the fiscal's&nbsp; motion, that the motion was made without his consent, but no&nbsp; prosecutor would ask for the&nbsp; exclusion&nbsp; of a defendant in a criminal case without first obtaining&nbsp; the assurance from that defendant that his testimony would be useful to the prosecution.<br><br>"What&nbsp; Soriano&nbsp; Alcaraz,&nbsp; Carlos Espino and&nbsp; Santos Cruz&nbsp; did after the&nbsp; shooting is worthy&nbsp; of&nbsp; note,&nbsp; Alcaraz,&nbsp; according to Jose Licuanan, worked regularly with&nbsp; him until May&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; He did not report for work the&nbsp; next day&nbsp; or on any day thereafter,&nbsp; Licuanan&nbsp; went to see him&nbsp; in his house, but he was not there, Espino had&nbsp; his residence on Eankusay in the vicinity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the shooting,&nbsp; but after the shooting he went to live&nbsp; on Herbosa&nbsp; where he was arrested by&nbsp; the police.&nbsp; He testified that&nbsp; he&nbsp; also lived&nbsp; in&nbsp; the house&nbsp; on Herbosa,&nbsp; but&nbsp;&nbsp; on the witness&nbsp; stand&nbsp; ho could not&nbsp; even&nbsp; give&nbsp; the number of&nbsp; the house. Santos Cruz&nbsp; went to&nbsp; Dampalit,&nbsp; Malabon, Rizal, after the&nbsp; shooting.&nbsp; He gave the lame excuse&nbsp; that he went there to work&nbsp; in the salt beds in Dampalit, but his' sudden change of occupation&nbsp; precisely&nbsp; at the time&nbsp; when he .was wanted by&nbsp; the police, from plumber to salt maker,&nbsp; would be too&nbsp; much to be a coincidence.&nbsp; If these three defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; not haunted&nbsp; by&nbsp; a guilty conscience they did not&nbsp; have to take flight after the&nbsp; shooting.<br><br>"The alibi of Soriano Alcaraz, Manuel Samonte, Jose Halili&nbsp; and Celso Carillo places&nbsp; them in the immediate&nbsp; vicinity of the shooting at the time it took place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their houses and that of Moises Halili, Where Jose Halili&nbsp; was&nbsp; resting,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; him, and the place where Samonte was allegedly with friends,&nbsp; are all&nbsp; in the same neighborhood. Cruz and Espirio, too, live in the same neighborhood and&nbsp; could&nbsp; have been at the&nbsp; scene of&nbsp; the&nbsp; shooting.&nbsp; At any&nbsp; rate, like&nbsp; the&nbsp; alibi&nbsp; of Alcaraz,&nbsp; Samonte, Halili&nbsp; and&nbsp; Carillo, their&nbsp; alibi avails&nbsp; them nothing in the face&nbsp; of their positive identification by witnesses of the prosecution as among the persons they saw at the scene of the shooting.<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></center><br>"Romeo&nbsp; Canary's testimony&nbsp; as a defense&nbsp; witness,&nbsp; repudiating his prior testimony when he was&nbsp; on the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; stand as a witness of the prosecution, heed not be taken seriously.&nbsp; His brother Jaime and&nbsp; his&nbsp; friend Alberto Agaran are dead and there is&nbsp; nothing he can do to bring them back to&nbsp; life.&nbsp; He must consider himself lucky to be alive. After the&nbsp; nightmare&nbsp; that was May 19,&nbsp; 1954, he must have&nbsp; lived&nbsp; in constant fear&nbsp; for his&nbsp; life,&nbsp; so&nbsp; much so&nbsp; that&nbsp; for&nbsp; a time he&nbsp; lived&nbsp; at police headquarters and came to court to testify as a&nbsp; witness&nbsp; for the prosecution&nbsp; in&nbsp; these cases, accompanied by a bodyguard.&nbsp; This setup could not continue indefinitely.&nbsp; He might as well insure his life by testifying for the defense.<br><br>"As to&nbsp; the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Elena&nbsp; Cabangsal,&nbsp; Elino Manzano's mother,&nbsp; this witness knows that his&nbsp; son died&nbsp; for the&nbsp; defendants' misguided&nbsp; cause.&nbsp; She&nbsp; gave&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; for her son's&nbsp; friends&nbsp; out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a mother's loyalty to the memory of a wayward son.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>"The&nbsp; finding&nbsp; that there was&nbsp; no meeting&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; house of Moises&nbsp; Halili&nbsp; notwithstanding, conspiracy to&nbsp; kill&nbsp; the occupants of the calesa is conclusive upon the record: first, Alcaraz gathered his co-defendants, gave them&nbsp; instructions and&nbsp; deployed&nbsp; them along Bankusay&nbsp; between&nbsp; Kapulong&nbsp; and&nbsp; Inocencio to prevent escape;&nbsp; second,&nbsp; Alcaraz&nbsp; instructed Manzano&nbsp; to&nbsp; start firing when he&nbsp; heard the signal. The signal was&nbsp; fired&nbsp; and&nbsp; Manzano started&nbsp; firing at the occupants of the calesa with his grease gun; third,&nbsp; Jose Halili,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Espino,&nbsp; Diaz,&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; and Alcaraz,&nbsp; too,&nbsp; followed&nbsp; by firing&nbsp; at&nbsp; the hapless&nbsp; victims; and&nbsp; fourth,&nbsp; Carillo&nbsp; intercepted Romeo&nbsp; Canary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the latter was escaping from&nbsp; the scene&nbsp; of&nbsp; the attack.<br><br>''Soriano Alcaraz,&nbsp; Carlos&nbsp; Espino, Manuel Samonte,&nbsp; Jose Halili, Santos&nbsp; Cruz and Celso&nbsp; Carillo are equally guilty of&nbsp; the&nbsp; resulting&nbsp;&nbsp; crimes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>"The fiscal alleges iliurder in each of the&nbsp; information in Criminal Cases Nos. 27149 and 27150, the first for the killing of Alberto Agaran, the second for fiat of Jaime Canary.&nbsp; The evidence sustains the 'charge, with treachery as the qualifying circumstance. The information&nbsp; in&nbsp; Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 27165&nbsp; is for frustrated murder, Lorenzo Canary, according&nbsp; to&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Melanlo Paulino,&nbsp; would have died&nbsp; had he not been given timely medical aid.&nbsp; The evidence, too, supports the charge, with treachery as the qualifying circumstance. Rut&nbsp; the evidence in Criminal Case No.&nbsp; 27166&nbsp; only establishes&nbsp; attempted murder, with treachery&nbsp; as a qualifying circumstance.&nbsp; Dr. Eizalino de la Fuente testified that Romeo Canary would have probably died from loss&nbsp; of blood and infection if he had&nbsp; not received timely&nbsp; medical assistance, but he would not give absolute assurance that the absence of such, assistance would have necessarily resulted in death.<br><br>"Each information alleges evident&nbsp; premeditation and abuse&nbsp; of superior strength, but these aggravating circumstances have not been proved.&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; Cruz and Celso&nbsp; Carillo surrendered&nbsp; to the authorities and should be credited&nbsp; with this&nbsp; mitigating circumstance; hence the&nbsp; minimum&nbsp; of the penalty provided for by law should&nbsp; be imposed on them in each case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the rest&nbsp; the medium&nbsp; of such penalty should be&nbsp; imposed.<br><br>"In view of the foregoing,&nbsp; the court finds Soriano Alcaraz y&nbsp; Licuanan alias&nbsp; Ano, Carlos Espino y Alcaraz alias&nbsp; Carling,&nbsp; Manuel Samonte y Soriano, Jose Halili&nbsp; y Alcaraz, Santos Cruz&nbsp; and Celso Carilio y&nbsp; Sangca&nbsp; guilty beyond reasonable doubt in&nbsp; each&nbsp; of the four cases&nbsp; and hereby renders judgment as follows:"&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</blockquote>According to&nbsp; the record,&nbsp; particularly the written statement&nbsp; of Manuel&nbsp; Samonte y&nbsp; Soriano and the testimony&nbsp; of Romeo Canary,&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; herein were members of that notorious group known as the Grease Gun Gang of&nbsp; Tondo, because of the grease&nbsp; gun which&nbsp; the organization possessed and freely used to liquidate its enemies,&nbsp; specially&nbsp; members of&nbsp; rival gangs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Tondo&nbsp; Grease Gun&nbsp; Gang was headed by Soriano Alcaraz&nbsp; alias Ano,&nbsp; but the brains&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was Moises Halili, who made the plans for the killings and took care&nbsp; of filing the&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; bail&nbsp; bonds for&nbsp; those&nbsp; members of the group who, after every killing, were either&nbsp; captured&nbsp; or were made to admit responsibility for the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the&nbsp; grease gun,&nbsp; the gang had an assortment&nbsp; of firearms,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as,&nbsp; a&nbsp; Thompson&nbsp; machine gun, a carbine and revolvers of different calibers.<br><br>It will be&nbsp; noticed from the decision of the trial court that it&nbsp; was not convinced that there was a meeting&nbsp; held under the house of Moises Halili early in the evening&nbsp; of May 19,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; One of the reasons given by&nbsp; it&nbsp; is that, had there been such a meeting, Romeo&nbsp; Canary would have noticed&nbsp; it when he, together with his&nbsp; companions in the calesa,&nbsp; rode&nbsp; along Bankusay Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place, the house&nbsp; of Moises, although on Bankusay Street, is beyond&nbsp; Kapulong Street,&nbsp; going north,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; calesa did not reach&nbsp; that far, so that Romeo was not in a position to notice anything&nbsp; going on under the&nbsp; house.&nbsp; In the second&nbsp; place, a secret meeting&nbsp; at night&nbsp; held by Alcaraz (Ano)&nbsp;&nbsp; and Moises with members of&nbsp; their gang, to decide on&nbsp; the details of liquidating their&nbsp; enemies that same evening, would, naturally, not be held under bright lights, but would be in darkness or semi-darkness, with windows and doors&nbsp; closed in order to avoid detection.&nbsp; Because&nbsp; of this belief of the trial&nbsp; court, and on the additional ground that about the&nbsp; same time&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; shooting took place, Moises&nbsp; Halili was&nbsp; at the&nbsp; City Jail at Meisic,&nbsp; Manila, trying to bail out some&nbsp; prisoners, it acquitted him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Meisic City Jail was not&nbsp; far from the place of the shooting and Moises could easily&nbsp; have hurried from&nbsp; that&nbsp; place&nbsp; to the jail in order to establish a credible alibi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, Moises&nbsp; was among those who attended&nbsp; the meeting under his house that night, and to show that he took part in the conspiracy to kill, and no mean part&nbsp; at that, he was even persuading, if not putting pressure, on Ambrosio Diaz&nbsp; to assume&nbsp; responsibility for the&nbsp; killing,&nbsp; because he (Moises) would see&nbsp; to&nbsp; it that Diaz would be bailed out.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would seem that Moises was&nbsp; either in the bail bonding business, or he was the one charged by the Tondo Grease Gun Gang with bailing&nbsp; out its members when jailed.&nbsp; As&nbsp; already stated, Moises was&nbsp; the brains of the&nbsp; gang, who made the plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was seen at the place of the killing immediately before the actual shooting.&nbsp; It was therefore, in our&nbsp; opinion, an error on the part of the trial court in&nbsp; acquitting him.&nbsp; Unfortunately, because of the inability&nbsp; of the Gov- ernment&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal, this&nbsp; error&nbsp; cannot now be corrected. What we stated about the&nbsp; acquittal&nbsp; of Moises Halili may equally be&nbsp; said of the acquittal of Amando&nbsp; Santos and Melchor&nbsp; Martinez. Both were seen by Ambrosio Diaz being present not only&nbsp; at the meeting held under the house of Moises Halili,&nbsp; but&nbsp; also at the place of the shooting, occupying the strategic positions assigned to them by Ano Alcaraz.&nbsp; But as the law stands, the&nbsp; Government is unable to move&nbsp; to&nbsp; correct the error of the trial court, and this Tribunal is&nbsp; powerless to&nbsp; effect&nbsp; the correction.<br><br>As we have&nbsp; already stated, the accused in this case, including those&nbsp; acquitted by the court were members of the Tondo Grease Gun Gang, which maintained a feud with other rival gangs, such as&nbsp; that to which the Canary brothers and Alberto Agaran&nbsp; belonged.&nbsp; To&nbsp; give an&nbsp; idea&nbsp; of the criminal background&nbsp; and&nbsp; violent&nbsp; character of these gang members,&nbsp; the record reveals that Ambrosio Diaz and Romeo Canary were together in the Boys Training School at Welfareville,&nbsp; Diaz having been detained there for estafa and Romeo for frustrated robbery, from which school they escaped several&nbsp; times.&nbsp; Diaz was for sometime&nbsp; engaged with&nbsp; Moises Halili in the fake&nbsp; ring&nbsp; deal&nbsp; not only&nbsp; in Manila, but in the provinces.&nbsp; Totoy Manzano, one of the accused, fought the police that tried to arrest&nbsp; him,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he was killed in the ensuing gun battle.&nbsp; During the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; of this&nbsp; case and after Ambrosio&nbsp; Diaz had&nbsp; testified,&nbsp; Romeo Canary, convinced that Diaz took part in the firing that killed his brother Jaime&nbsp; and almost killed his other brother&nbsp; Lorenzo, met or followed&nbsp; Diaz&nbsp; to the movie theater Clover, and there stabbed&nbsp; him to death.<br><br>It&nbsp; will also be observed from the decision&nbsp; of the trial court that&nbsp; it could not&nbsp; believe that the purpose&nbsp; of the trip&nbsp; of the, Canary brothers and Agaran to Bankusay Street, that night&nbsp; of May 19, 1954, was to see Jose Halili in relation&nbsp; with his promise and assurance that he would introduce them&nbsp; to the pig vendor who would sell them the animals at&nbsp; a price much lower than that charged&nbsp; by other&nbsp; pig vendors.&nbsp; We&nbsp; have&nbsp; a&nbsp; different&nbsp; impression.<br><br>There is evidence to the effect that&nbsp; the four victims went to Bankusay Street that night for that very purpose, and that their presence there was anticipated and known by Ano&nbsp; Alcaraz&nbsp; and Moises&nbsp; Halili through&nbsp; Carlos Espino, who was&nbsp; sent to the house of Romeo to inform him that Jose&nbsp; Halili was waiting for&nbsp; them&nbsp; at Bankusay Street. Otherwise, Ano&nbsp; Alcaraz would not have been in a position&nbsp;&nbsp; to know that the four victims&nbsp; would&nbsp; be at Bankusay Street&nbsp;&nbsp; at a certain time that evening, round up his followers, including Ambrosio Diaz, get&nbsp; them together under the houae of Moises Halili, and&nbsp; give&nbsp; them instructions&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; their respective strategic places along Bankusay Street, in front and behind the calesa.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, there is reason to believe that the Canary brothers and Agaran were lured to Bankusay&nbsp; Street, thereby establishing the&nbsp; existence of the aggravating&nbsp; circumstance of&nbsp; craft having been employed.<br><br>But even considering&nbsp; and&nbsp; accepting the reasons given by the trial court believing and finding that the victims went&nbsp; to Bankusay Street for&nbsp; a different purpose, namely, on a&nbsp; shady deal, without any intervention whatsoever on the part of the&nbsp; accused herein, and&nbsp; in this respect giving the appellants the benefit of any doubt, we still have the aggravating circumstance that the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; was&nbsp; committed in band. According to the evidence, there were at least four firearms used by the accused on that occasion, namely, one grease gun and three revolvers of .45 caliber.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp; there was&nbsp; the dagger&nbsp; used by Celso&nbsp; Carillo&nbsp; in&nbsp; stabbing&nbsp; Romeo.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial court evidently&nbsp; overlooked&nbsp; this aggravating circumstance,&nbsp; which was duly alleged in the information and to&nbsp; which our&nbsp; attention is being called by. the Solicitor General.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of&nbsp; the existence of&nbsp; this aggravating&nbsp; circumstance,&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; circumstance,&nbsp;&nbsp; despite what&nbsp; has&nbsp; been said&nbsp; in some cases to the effect that it is to be applied only&nbsp; to&nbsp; crimes&nbsp; against&nbsp; property,&nbsp; is in&nbsp; truth, equally applicable to crimes against&nbsp; persons, such as murder,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> the penalty in these four cases must have to be imposed in its maximum degree, except as to Santos Cruz and Celso Carillo who surrendered to the authorities, this mitigating circumstance in their favor offsetting the aggravating circumstance of in band, in which case, the penalty as to them should&nbsp; be imposed in the medium degree.&nbsp; This means the penalty&nbsp; of death for Soriano&nbsp; Alcaraz, Carlos Espino, Manuel Satnonte and Jose Halili, and reclusion perpetwa for Santos Gruz&nbsp; and Celso&nbsp; Carillo,&nbsp; for&nbsp; each of the two killings.<br><br>Following the recommendation of the&nbsp; Solicitor General, the decision appealed from is&nbsp; modified as follows:<br><br>In G. R. No. L-9084 (Criminal Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 27149), Soriano Alcaraz y Licuanan alias Ano,&nbsp; Carlos Espino y Alcaraz alias Car ling,&nbsp; Manuel Samonte y&nbsp; Soriano and Jose Halili y Alcaraz are each&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; the extreme penalty of death, and Santos Cruz and Celso&nbsp; Carillo y&nbsp; Sangca to reclusion perpetua;<br><br>In G.
