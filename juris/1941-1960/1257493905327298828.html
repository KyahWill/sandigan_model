				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by plaintiffs Rosenda Fernandez, et al. from the decision of the Court 
of First Instance of Pangasinan in Civil Case No. 13797 dismissing their 
complaint.
<p>It appears that on October 10, 1932, Patricio Fernandez, 
predecessor-in-interest of plaintiffs, executed a sale <em>con pacto de 
retro</em> in favor of Catalino Fernandez over a parcel of fishpond land located 
in barrio Caloocan Sur, Municipality of Binmaley, Pangasinan, for the price of 
P160, redeemable within four years.</p>
<p>As Patricio Fernandez never redeemed the aforesaid land, the buyer Catalino 
Fernandez, on November 14, 1953, filed an application for the registration 
thereof in his name (Land Registration Case No, N-1494, L.R.C. Record No. 
N-6167). The application was opposed by the heirs of the vendor Patricio 
Fernandez, who also filed Civil Case No. 12419 against Catalino Fernandez to 
quiet their supposed title over the land in question, claiming that the contract 
between their predecessor Patricio Fernandez and defendant was merely an 
equitable mortgage and not a real <em>pacto de retro</em> sale. After a joint 
trial of the two cases, the Court below declared the contract in question to be 
only an equitable mortgage. On appeal by defendant Catalino Fernandez, however, 
the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court, found the 
contract between Patricio Fernandez and defendant to be a true sale with the 
right to repurchase, declared defendant to be the absolute owner thereof, and 
ordered its registration in his name (C.A. G.R. Nos. 21421-R and 21422-R). This 
judgment became final on September 25, 1958.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, or on October 24, 1958, the heirs of Patricio Fernandez 
filed the present complaint against Catalino Fernandez, alleging that they had 
the right to repurchase the land in question from defendant under the provisions 
of the last paragraph of Article 1606 of the New Civil Code, and that they had 
offered to redeem said land from defendant since September 26, 1958 but had only 
met with refusal. Defendant moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the 
same was barred by the prior judgment of the Court of Appeals in Civil Case No. 
12419 and.Land Registration Case No. N-1494, L.R.C. Record No. N-6167, declaring 
him to be owner of the land in dispute and ordering its registration in his 
name, and that furthermore, his ownership thereto had become vested in him 
before the New Civil Code took effect. On November 18, 1958, the lower court 
sustained the motion and dismissed the complaint. From this judgment, 
plaintiffs, as earlier stated, appealed, insisting on their right to repurchase 
under the last paragraph of Article 1606, New Civil Code.</p>
<p>There is no merit in the appeal. It is already settled that where the right 
to repurchase had expired before the effectivity of the New Civil Code, Article 
1606 thereof providing that "the vendor may still exercise the right to 
repurchase within thirty days from the time final judgment was rendered in a 
civil action on the basis that the contract was a true sale with right to 
repurchase," can no longer be applied, as it would be an impairment of a right 
that had already become vested in the vendee under the provisions of the old 
Code (Siopongco <em>vs</em>. Castro, G. R. No. L-12167, April 29, 1959; De la 
Cruz <em>vs</em>. Muyot, et al., 102 Phil., 318). Full ownership over the land 
in question having become consolidated and vested in defendant-appellee since 
1936, his right thereto can no longer be impaired by allowing plaintiffs now to 
sue for the exercise of the right of redemption given by Article 1606 of the New 
Code. It must have also been for this reason that, as pointed out by the Court 
below the Court of Appeals (in C.A. G. R. Nos. 21421-R and 21422-R) did not 
reserve any right of redemption under Article 1606 in favor of 
plaintiffs-appellants, and instead ordered the registration of the land in 
question in defendant's name. The decision of the Court of Appeals merely 
confirmed that the appellee had become the owner of the disputed land long 
before, when the period of redemption expired.</p>
<p>It is not amiss to note here also that the right of action to question the 
nature of the original transaction as well as any action to recover the land, if 
any such rights ever existed, were extinguished by prescription ten years after 
the appellee consolidated his ownership in 1936.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against 
plaintiffs-appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautisia Angelo, Labrador, Barrera, 
Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur..</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
