				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">There is little or no dispute as to these facts. The appellants were members 
of an underground organization called volunteer guards. On February 8, 1943, 
while they and other volunteer guards were gathered at their camp in barrio 
Tagabakid, municipality of Mati, province of Davao, they were attacked by a 
Japanese patrol guided by Primo Jurolan and Demenciano Chavez. On the 12th, the 
appellants, with Ignacio Vicente, Tranqui Manapos and other volunteer guards, 
marched to Jurolan's barrio, one or two kilometers distant from their camp, in 
search of the men who had betrayed them. Finding Jurolan and his wife, Delfina 
Gatillo, below their house, defendants Cerbesa Malimbasao, Arades Lagbawan and 
Sarmiento Panganay tied Jurolan's hands behind his back and led him upstairs. 
Jurolan's wife's hands were similarly bound and she was taken into the house, 
but the identity of the accused who did this is not disclosed by the record. 
Inside the house, the couple were stabbed and killed with daggers, the husband 
by Arades Lagbawan and the wife by Enrique Lemente. When the victims were 
already dead, Mangapa Talbin set fire to the house with Jurolan's three day-old 
live infant, as well as its parents' lifeless bodies, inside, as the result of 
which the child perished in the fire. The accused took Jurolan's two elder 
children out of the house before burning the house.
<p>The court below found the defendants guilty of murder for the death of 
Delfina Gatillo and sentenced Florentino Paterno to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> 
and his five co-defendants to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day to 
17 years, h months and 1 day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, and to indemnify 
the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P2,000. For the death of the child (no 
reference to the burning of the house was made) the court sentenced all the 
accused to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to pay an indemnity of P2,000 to its 
heirs. The accused were also condemned to pay proportionate shares of the costs. 
For the murder of Primo Jurolan, the defendants were pronounced entitled, to the 
benefits of amnesty Proclamation No. 8 for the reason that Jurolan, as the court 
found, was a Japanese spy.</p>
<p>The defendants' plea on this appeal is that they acted in obedience to direct 
orders and threats of one Anselmo Onofre. It is alleged that they committed the 
crimes from fear of that man, fear of being themselves slain if they refused to 
comply. It is said that Onofre was the recognized overall commander of the 
defendants organization and that he was the only one who had a firearm, a .45 
caliber pistol, the defendants being provided with no more weapons than 
bolos.</p>
<p>The accused did not introduce any evidence on their behalf to substantiate 
their plea. They rested their case on the testimony of Ignacio Vicente and 
Tranqui Manapos, two of their companions who were used by the prosecution as 
witnesses.</p>
<p>As the Solicitor General says in his brief, these witnesses turned hostile to 
the prosecution and testified virtually in favor of the appellants. Ignacio 
Vicente swore on direct examination that Paterno was the leader of the band and 
was the man who had Primo Jurolan and his wife killed and their house burned 
with their baby inside. But on cross-examination, in answer to very leading 
questions, he declared that Anselmo Onofre it was who was their supreme 
commander and who ordered the slaying of the Jurolan couple and the destruction 
of their dwelling. The next witness for the prosecution, Tranqui Manapos, in his 
examination-in-chief declared in the same vein as Vicente did on 
cross-examination.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that in these two witnesses' affidavits, sworn to before 
the justice of the peace, and in their testimony before the provincial fiscal, 
not even a hint was made of Anselmo Onofre. For this reason the trial judge 
believes that what is contained in Vicente's and Manapos' affidavits is the 
truth and that in deviating from their previous statements their motive was no 
other than a desire to free Paterno from punishment. In this we concur. 
Vicente's and Manapos' explanation for not naming Onofre to the justice of the 
peace and the fiscal; that is, they were afraid of him, is unconvincing, since 
Onofre was not around when they made their statements—in fact Onofre's 
whereabouts was unknown—and particularly since they were already in the custody 
and under the protection of peace officers. Moreover, the affidavits were made 
in June, 1946, when the war was over, complete peace and order had been restored 
and civil government reestablished.</p>
<p>The defendants themselves made written and sworn confessions before the same 
justice of the peace, and none of them, except Paterno and Lemente, implicated 
Onofre. More, these confessions were produced by the accused before the Amnesty 
Commission as the sole evidence on which they relied for their petition for 
discharge under the amnesty. It is unthinkable that evidence of vital importance 
to their defense, so vital as to be the sole point stressed by them in the court 
below and in this instance, should have been forgotten or withheld by all the 
accused, except two, for no other reason than fear of an absent, or dead, 
man.</p>
<p>The defendants take exception to the admission of their confessions, 
introduced in evidence as Exhibits D, E, F, G and I, on the theory that they 
were mere copies. The objection is not well taken. The impugned exhibits are 
certified true copies of carbon copies of the original, copies which were kept 
at the office of the justice of the peace. The non-presentation of the copies 
which contained the defendants' signatures was explained by the fiscal, who 
stated that the original had been destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>Exhibit D to I, independent of Vicente's and Manapos' testimony, are in 
themselves conclusive proofs of appellants' guilt. Their voluntary character has 
not been challenged. Although Paterno's affidavit (Exhibit D) incriminates 
Onofre, yet it does not speak of compulsion or duress brought to bear on him or 
any of his fellow-defendants. So even if we should assume, for the sake of 
argument, that the crimes at bar were perpetrated by Onofre's order, such order 
would not serve to justify or excuse appellants' deeds.</p>
<p>It was only Lemente, the accused who, besides Paterno, implicated Onofre, 
that made a statement which, if true, might exempt him from criminal 
responsibility with respect to the killing of Delfina Gatillo. Lemente stated in 
his affidavit that Onofre commanded him at the point of a pistol to kill 
Jurolan's wife. But no credence can be given to this part of Lemente's 
statement. There was absolutely no need for Onofre, granting that he was 
present, to force an unwilling tool to take the life of a defenseless woman when 
to do the killing himself would require less effort on his part than to threaten 
and intimidate a comrade.</p>
<p>From the facts set forth in this decision, the appellants have been correctly 
found guilty of murder with reference to the slaying of Delfina Gatillo, but 
they had the same degree of participation in the crime and all should be 
sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. For setting fire to the house with the 
resulting death of the child, they are guilty of arson, not murder, under 
Article 321, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code. Murder or homicide is 
absorbed in arson as defined in this article. Murder or homicide in a juridical 
sense would exist if the killing were the objective of the malefactor and the 
burning of a building were resorted to only as the means of accomplishing his 
purpose. The rule is otherwise when arson, as in this case, is itself the end 
and death is a mere consequences. However, the punishment imposed by the trial 
court is correct in view of all the circumstances. The indemnity for Delfina 
Gatillo's and her baby's death should be raised to P6,000.00 each. With these 
modifications, the appealed decision is affirmed, with costs of the appeal 
charged against the appellants in equal share.</p>
