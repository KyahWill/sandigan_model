				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action&nbsp; of certiorari seeks&nbsp; to&nbsp; set aside a&nbsp; writ of preliminary injunction issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; Riginio B.&nbsp; Macadaeg, presiding, restraining the petitioner herein (a)&nbsp; from impeding, obrstructing,&nbsp; hampering&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; interfering&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiffs' (respondents&nbsp; herein)&nbsp; shipping&nbsp; business;&nbsp; (6)&nbsp; from&nbsp; intimidating, insulting,&nbsp; threatening, coercing and&nbsp; preventing persons desiring and intending to enter the pier gates and&nbsp; render service on&nbsp; plaintiffs'&nbsp; vessels; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; from picketing plaintiffs' vessels&nbsp; at the&nbsp; piers of the Manila South Harbor.<br><br>The above&nbsp; order was issued&nbsp; upon a complaint filed&nbsp; by the respondents, alleging that&nbsp; on&nbsp; February 18, 19S6, the petitioner labor union commenced picketing&nbsp; respondents'&nbsp; vessels docked&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; various piers of the Manila&nbsp; South Harbor for the purpose of intimidating and coercing them to accede to their unlawful demands; that respondents are the shipping agents in the Philippines of various foreign and&nbsp; domestic shipowners and&nbsp; vessels that regularly&nbsp; call at the&nbsp; Port of Manila,&nbsp; and that as such agents they&nbsp; are in charge of provisioning, representing and attending&nbsp; to the needs of said vessels while at this&nbsp; port; that since 1951 respondents&nbsp; have&nbsp; individually&nbsp; contracted&nbsp; with several watchmen agencies, as&nbsp; independent contractors, to perform the work of guarding and protecting said vessels; that the watchmen are&nbsp; employed&nbsp; by the said agencies,&nbsp; and that their salaries are paid by said agencies and&nbsp; not by the respondents; that respondents have no authority to hire or dismiss said watchmen;&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; demanded that the respondents enter&nbsp; into&nbsp; a collective bargaining&nbsp; agreement with it, with regard to the employment of watchmen; that respondents refused to accede to said demands because they are not the&nbsp; employers of said watchmen.&nbsp; The respondents,&nbsp; therefore, prayed that&nbsp; a writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction issued against the petitioner upon their filing a bond.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; filing of a&nbsp; bond&nbsp; of&nbsp; P10,000&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance issued the writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>It is the claim and&nbsp; contention of the petitioners&nbsp; before this Court that the refusal of the respondents to enter into a collective bargaining agreement with it is a labor dispute within the purview of Section 9, Republic&nbsp; Act 875,&nbsp; otherwise known&nbsp; as the Magna Charta of Labor,&nbsp; and that, therefore, the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction without the requisites established by Section 9 thereof is beyond the jurisdiction of the respondent judge and that the writ is&nbsp; a complete nullity.<br><br>In answer to the above contention, respondents&nbsp; allege that the&nbsp; jurisdiction of the respondent judge to issue the writ of preliminary injunction is&nbsp; based on the allegations of the complaint; that there is no&nbsp; labor dispute between the petitioners and the&nbsp; respondent companies;&nbsp; that petitioners' picketing was not peaceful but was accompanied and characterized by violence, coercion, threats, intimidation and fraud; that there were no "amicable negotiations" between respondent&nbsp; and&nbsp; petitioner with&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the terms, tenure or conditions of employment, etc., that there is&nbsp; no&nbsp; labor dispute&nbsp; between&nbsp; petitioner and&nbsp; respondents because&nbsp; there is no&nbsp; employer-employee&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; between them.<br><br>A cursory examination of&nbsp; the&nbsp; original&nbsp; petition filed in the court <i>a quo</i> discloses that the watchmen are employed by the respondents herein thru the watchmen agencies, and in order to justify the granting of the writ of preliminary injunction,&nbsp; care was&nbsp; made in the framing of&nbsp; the original petition&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; court <i>a&nbsp; qu</i>o, to allege that the watchmen were not employees of the respondents because&nbsp; of the existence of an agreement between respondents and the&nbsp; watchmen agencies that the watchmen should be employees&nbsp; of the latter and not the former.&nbsp; But no matter how studiously&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint avoids&nbsp; stating that&nbsp; the watchmen employed by the steamship agencies are not their employees, because they are employees of the watchmen agencies, the stubborn fact remains that the said watchmen are ultimately working for the steamship&nbsp; agencies and ultimately paid for by the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may have been true that these watchmen&nbsp; were contracted for by the watchmen agencies, but the fact remains that their services were availed&nbsp; of and their&nbsp; compensation paid by&nbsp; the&nbsp; steamship agencies, even if such were done thru the agencies and&nbsp; without&nbsp; the direct&nbsp; intervention of the steamship agencies.<br><br>The law expressly provides&nbsp; that a labor&nbsp; dispute exists "regardless of whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of&nbsp; employer and employee."&nbsp; This&nbsp; is the express provision of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 875, which&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>"(j)&nbsp; The term 'labor dispute' includes any controversy concerning terms, tenure&nbsp; or conditions of employment,&nbsp; or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, "inamtaining,&nbsp; changing, or&nbsp; seeking to arrange&nbsp; terms&nbsp; or conditions of employment,&nbsp; regardless of whether&nbsp; the disputants&nbsp; stand&nbsp; in the proximate&nbsp; relation of employer and employee.&nbsp;&nbsp; "*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *." </blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; evident that&nbsp; a "labor&nbsp; dispute"&nbsp; existed between&nbsp; the watchmen,&nbsp; members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioning&nbsp; union,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the steamship agencies, the respondents&nbsp; herein.&nbsp;&nbsp; The allegations&nbsp; in the original complaint filed in the court below that there is no relationship of employer and employee is a conclusion&nbsp; of law.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the watchmen&nbsp; were actually employed in&nbsp; watching&nbsp; and&nbsp; guarding&nbsp; the steamers, no amount of reasoning can deny the&nbsp; fact that they&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; and actually work for the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; steamship agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; If their&nbsp; services were contracted for and are paid&nbsp; thru&nbsp; the watchmen agencies, the relationship&nbsp; may not&nbsp; have&nbsp; been proximate,&nbsp; but&nbsp; this&nbsp; fact can not belie&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of the relationship&nbsp; of&nbsp; employer&nbsp; and employee, nor&nbsp; argue against the existence of a labor dispute.<br><blockquote>"An action may involve a 'labor dispute'&nbsp; within sections 101-115 of this title,&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; that the&nbsp; dispute is not between&nbsp; employer&nbsp; and his&nbsp; own employees.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Coumanis, CCA. Ala. .1943, 135 F. ad. 163, .146 A. L. R. 1241.)"&nbsp; (29&nbsp; USCA 65.)<br><br>"The definitions&nbsp; of&nbsp; 'labor disputes' in this chapter must "be con- fined to&nbsp; the cases involving that&nbsp; exercise of freedom of&nbsp; action of employees&nbsp; dealt with&nbsp; by declared public policy of protecting1&nbsp; employees in&nbsp; freedom of association and in designation of bargaining representatives.&nbsp; Donnelly Garment Co. vs. International Ladies Garment Workers'&nbsp; Union, D.C.

(Id. p. 85.)<br><br>"This&nbsp; chapter was&nbsp; intended to&nbsp; remove&nbsp; the&nbsp; barriers&nbsp; raised in former decisions of the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of the United States which required&nbsp; the&nbsp; relationship of&nbsp; employer&nbsp; and employee in&nbsp; order to constitute a labor dispute and to&nbsp; provide that&nbsp; only&nbsp; an&nbsp; indirect interest was,necessary in order to include a party within the meaning of a labor dispute. Houston and North Texas Motor Freight Lines vs. Local Union No. 886 of International&nbsp; Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs.&nbsp; Stablemen, and&nbsp; Helpers of&nbsp; America,&nbsp; D.C. Old. 1938, 24&nbsp; F.&nbsp; Supp. 619." (Id., p. 86.)<br><br>"A&nbsp; 'labor dispute',&nbsp; within this,&nbsp; chapter,&nbsp; retains its character&nbsp; as such if it involves any question that refers&nbsp; to any of the terms and conditions of. employment&nbsp; or&nbsp; that&nbsp; might&nbsp; involve&nbsp; the betterment of any terms or conditions, and existence&nbsp; of&nbsp; labor dispute is not negatived by&nbsp; fact that plaintiffs&nbsp; and&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; do not&nbsp; stand&nbsp; in relation of&nbsp; employer&nbsp; and&nbsp; employee, or by&nbsp; the fact employees are altogether satisfied with&nbsp; conditions of&nbsp; employment. Petrucci&nbsp; vs. Hogan, 1941, 27 N.Y.S. 2d 718,&nbsp; 176&nbsp; Misc. 140."&nbsp; (Id. p. 86.)</blockquote>We find,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the court should have found that&nbsp; a labor dispute exists&nbsp; and should have&nbsp; proceeded in accordance with Section&nbsp; 9&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 875 before issuing&nbsp; an&nbsp; injuncton.&nbsp;&nbsp; In issuing&nbsp; the injunction without following the&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; outlined in&nbsp; said section, the court&nbsp; exceeded its&nbsp; jurisdiction.<br><br>Assuming, however,&nbsp; that&nbsp; it entertained&nbsp; doubt as&nbsp; 'to whether or not the relation of employer and employee exists between the petitioning union and the respondent&nbsp; steamship agencies, it was also an&nbsp; abuse of&nbsp; discretion on its&nbsp; part to have issued&nbsp; the injunction without hearing the parties and receiving evidence&nbsp; on the main issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; The necessity of a hearing is demanded by the fact&nbsp; that the existence or non-existence of a&nbsp; labor dispute determines the nature of the proceedings that must be followed&nbsp; in the issuance of an injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; a labor dispute&nbsp; exists then the provisions of the Magna Charta of Labor&nbsp; (R, A. No. 875)&nbsp; should be strictly followed, as ruled by&nbsp; Us&nbsp; in various decisions (PAFLU, et al. vs. Tan, et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> L-9115,&nbsp; prom. Aug. 31,1956; paplu, et al. .vs.&nbsp; Barot, et al., L-9281, prom.&nbsp; Sept. 28, 1956) ; and&nbsp; on the other hand, if no labor dispute exists then the court may issue an ordinary injunction in accordance with&nbsp; the Rules of&nbsp; Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; policy of&nbsp; social justice guaranteed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution demands that when cases appear to involve labor&nbsp; disputes&nbsp; courts should take&nbsp; care in the exercise of their prerogatives and discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in that way&nbsp; can the policy enunciated in the Constitution be carried out.&nbsp;&nbsp; We hold that it is evident that the trial judge abused its discretion when&nbsp; it granted&nbsp; the writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction without previous investigation as to whether or not a labor dispute exists within the meaning of the Magna Charta of Labor.<br><br>The order of the trial&nbsp; court granting the writ of pre- liminary injunction having been issued in excess of jurisdiction and&nbsp; with grave abuse, of&nbsp; discretion, the same&nbsp; is hereby set aside, and the writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction issued in favor of the petitioners in this Court&nbsp; is hereby declared permanent.&nbsp; With costs against respondent steamship&nbsp; agencies.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Conception., Reyes, J.
