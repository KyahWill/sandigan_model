				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-3463, March 06, 1950</h4>
				<H3>LEONCIO ROSARES, PETITIONER, VS. DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In his first petition for habeas corpus against the Director of Prisons, 
filed in this Court on November 14, 1948, Leoncio Rosares alleged that his 
maximum term of imprisonment was six (6) years. On that basis, computing his 
period of imprisonment already served, including preventive imprisonment as well 
as the period allowed for good conduct, it was found that he had yet to serve 
the subsidiary imprisonment provided by law because of non-payment of the 
indemnity of P2,000, which formed part of his sentence in a decision of the 
Court of First Instance of Leyte finding him guilty of homicide. For that reason 
his petition was denied in a resolution dated November 17, 1949.
<p>The petitioner has now filed a second petition on February 9, 1950, asking 
for a reconsideration of our resolution, alleging that his true maximum 
imprisonment was six (6) years and one (1) day and not only six (6) years as 
erroneously alleged in his first petition. This addition of one day to the 
period of imprisonment raises the prison sentence from <em>prision 
correccional</em> to <em>prision mayor</em> and places the case within the terms 
of Art. 39, par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code which provides that when the 
principal penalty imposed is higher than <em>prision correccional </em>no 
subsidiary imprisonment shall be imposed upon the culprit. The record shows that 
without this subsidiary imprisonment petitioner has already served his sentence, 
in fact, with a little excess. The Solicitor General who represents the 
respondent Director of Prisons after conducting the necessary investigation 
makes the same finding and recommends that petitioner be now released.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations, the resolution of November 17, 1949, 
is hereby set aside; the second petition is granted and petitioner Leoncio 
Rosares is ordered released, unless, there be any other lawful cause for his 
further detention. No costs.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur. </p></div>
