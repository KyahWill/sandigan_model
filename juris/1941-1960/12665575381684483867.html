				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellants, Valentin Custodio and his two brothers, Tomas and Silvestre, seek 
reversal of a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Quezon (Criminal Case 
No. 11464) sentencing them to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> with the opposite 
accessory penalties and costs, for the murder of one Melanio Balancio, and to 
pay jointly and severally, an Indemnity of P6,000 to the heirs of the 
deceased.
<p>The evidence is that in the evening of February 22, 1953, the spouses Melanio 
Balancio and Ines Edovas were wakened by the bleating of a goat in the corral 
near their home in barrio Mangalang, Sariaya, Quezon. The husband stood up and, 
equipped with a flashlight, went down the rear stairway of the house, at the 
back porch (<em>batalan</em>). As he was descending, he was shot at from behind 
by someone below the house. As Balancio staggered on, more shots were fired at 
him from near a coconut tree standing a few meters north of the house, and he 
fell. Ines Edovas, the wife, upon hearing the shots, came from within the house 
with a gas (petroleum) lamp; she placed it on the porch railing and descended, 
only to find her husband sprawled on the ground and bleeding profusely. She 
wailed, "My God, why is this done to us," ("Dios ko, bakit kami ginanito") to 
which some one, whom she recognized as Valentin Custodio, was heard to reply, 
"That is what befits a bully" ("Yaan ang bagay sa barako"). Thereupon, Valentin 
was rejoined by his brothers Tomas and Silvestre, and the three, bearing 
firearms, went away. Ines Edovas shouted for help, but as no one came, she 
managed to drag her bleeding husband up their house. She then sped to the house 
of a neighbor, Maria Mindanao, and fetched her.</p>
<p>The deed was also witnessed by Antonio Goc, a brother-in-law of the deceased, 
whose curiosity while proceeding toward Meianio's house, was aroused by the 
bleating of a goat as he neared the corral. His view being impeded by the tall 
grass, Goc went around the corral toward the house; and from behind a tree a few 
meters west of it, he saw Valentin Custodio fired at Melanio Balancio as the 
latter descended the stairs, while another series of shots was fired by 
Silvestre Custodio a little later, from a point near another coconut tree north 
of the house. The third brother, Tomas Custodio, then arrived holding a goat by 
the leg; and afterwards, Valentin was heard to say "Patay na ang barako" (the 
bully is dead) as the wife of the deceased reached the scene. Apparently fearful 
of detection, Goc scurried away to his father-in-law's house; from there, 
accompanied by his wife, he returned to the residence of the deceased to furnish 
whatever help he could.</p>
<p>Neighbors began pouring in the Balancio house a short time after the 
shooting. Toward midnight, the wounded man recovered enough to tell his 
brother-in-law to have the Custodio brothers arrested as the ones answerable for 
what happened to him. This statement, given in gasps, was also heard by the 
wife. Shortly thereafter, Melanio Balancio died. The medical certificate is to 
the effect that he received six gunshot wounds; three bullets had coursed upward 
from the buttocks to the abdominal region; two more penetrated from the back to 
the chest; and a sixth grazed the right thigh (Exhibit ,A). The investigating 
officers found .45 caliber rifle shells on the ground, five near the stairway, 
and the other elsewhere. </p>
<p>Upon instructions of the barrio lieutenant Juan Resurreccion, Antonio Goc 
reported the killing to the Chief of Police of Sariaya, who enlisted the help of 
the Constabulary. Sergeant Ernesto Jose" investigated the widow and the 
neighbors, and thereafter, search started for the Custodio brothers. The latter, 
however, voluntarily surrendered before arrest.</p>
<p>The appellants concentrate their attack primarily on the sufficiency of their 
identification, based on alleged inconsistencies and contradictions of the 
eyewitnesses, Ines Edovas and Antonio Goc; the improbability of their being able 
to recognize the culprits in the darkness; the seriousness of Balancio's wounds 
as allegedly precluding his ability to give an <em>ante mortem</em> statement. 
Lastly, they rely on the <em>alibi</em> testified to by the witnesses for the 
defense.</p>
<p>We find no improbability in the testimony of either the widow Edovas or 
Antonio Goc. The Custodios had been former neighbors of Balancio and his wife, 
in barrio Aratan, Sariaya, and hence their features were familiar to the latter; 
nor does the defense contest that Antonio Goc also knew the three brothers. As 
to the possibility of recognition, the Court below was satisfied that the moon 
and the lamp at the "batalan" furnished adequate illumination for it, 
considering that, as found by the Judge at the ocular inspection, the appellants 
were seen in an open space, and the surrounding trees lay. some 6 meters away 
from the spot where the appellants were identified. Counsel's plea that the 
recognition was rendered dubious by shadows cast by the trees and by the slats 
of the "batalan" flooring, disregards the fact that the attackers' positions 
must have changed from time to time, so that there is no denying the possibility 
of their features having been sufficiently revealed during the interval between 
the shooting and their departure. It is to be remembered also that the witnesses 
saw the culprits at close range—ten meters more or less, to judge from the 
evidence. That there was a clear moon, although in its quarter phase, is not 
denied.</p>
<p>While Edovas and Goc differed as to some details, the variations are 
compatible and do not affect their credibility, for they saw the occurrence from 
different angles. Indeed, it would be suspicious if their narrations had 
completely coincided. </p>
<p>Appellants lay much stress on the alleged failure of the widow to disclose 
immediately the identity of the killers to the barrio lieutenant, when the 
latter went to her house shortly after her husband had expired. But she cogently 
explained that her difference was due to her fear of reprisals from the armed 
killers, who might still be lurking near by shortly after the murder; on the 
other hand it is uncontroverted that she denounced the appellants the next day, 
to the Constabulary investigator, and also in her affidavit of February 25. Our 
jurisprudence reveals repeated instances of witnesses silenced by fear until the 
police authorities had intervened. As to the argument that if she or Goc had 
really revealed the identity of the killers to the Sariaya police, the 
constabulary would not have been called, nor would the latter have spent some 
six hours interrogating witnesses and looking for evidence, we find the 
contention based on the worthless assumption that investigators should be 
satisfied with the widow's statements, without taking pains to verify the truth 
thereof, or scrutinizing the scene of the crime. It is also significant in this 
connection that when the Chief of Police of Sariaya testified, the defense did 
not ask for his reasons in referring the case to the Constabulary 
authorities.</p>
<p>For the rest, it is needless to discuss at length whether Balancio could have 
survived his wounds long enough to make the <em>ante mortem</em> statement. The 
matter depends upon the vitality of the individual, for which no general rules 
can be laid. The dying declaration rests on the testimony of Edovas and Goc, who 
heard it, and the trial Court was satisfied of their reliability. The appellants 
have failed to show sufficient reasons to change that conclusion.</p>
<p>The deceased himself had previously revealed to constabulary sergeant Jose 
the motive for the crime, to wit, that he was suspected to have done away with 
one of the Custodio brothers. (Epifanio), shot in barrio Aratan in 1950. And 
none of the appellants denied their having possession of or access to rifles of 
the type used in shooting the deceased.</p>
<p>We find no adequate reason for reversing the trial court's disbelief in 
appellant's <em>alibi</em>. From the testimony of the defense witnesses, their 
memory appears riveted exclusively on the night of the crime, i.e., Sunday, 
February 22, when they claim to remember that Tomas and Silvestre Custodio were 
in Taysan, Batangas, at about eight in the evening; but the same witnesses 
professed inability to recall other dates or occasions in which they met said 
appellants. The lower court also noted the curious coincidence that appellant 
Tomas Custodio should go as far as Taysan, Batangas, to cut bamboos when he had 
other bamboo groves nearer home; and that he should have decided to do so on the 
very same day that his brother Silvestre likewise proceeded. to the same town, 
precisely on a date set for the holding of a baptismal party for a child of 
their brother Valentin, that by custom Tomas and Silvestre would be most 
interested in attending. We find that the <em>alibi</em> can not prevail over 
the positive testimony of the credible witnesses for the prosecution, who 
positively identified the accused as the locus of the crime (People <em>vs</em>. 
De Asis, 61 Phil. 389; People <em>vs</em>. Faltado, 84 Phil., 88; People 
<em>vs</em>. Mendoza, (84 Phil., 148; People <em>vs</em>. Jistiado, 94 Phil., 
825; People <em>vs</em>. Fader, 94 Phil., 522).</p>
<p>The guilt of appellants having been established beyond reasonable doubt, 
there remains the question of the appropriate penalty. The lower court imposed 
the medium, to wit <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, on the theory that the murder 
was characterized by the presence of both <em>alevosia</em> (which also absorbed 
nocturnity) and premeditation, but with one of them compensated by the 
mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. In our opinion, however, it was 
error to consider that evident premeditation existed, merely on the basis of the 
conspiracy between the apellants herein.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions, where the act of conspiracy is directly established, 
with proof of the attendant deliberation and selection of the method, time, and 
means of executing the crime, the existence of evident premeditation can be 
taken for granted. In the case before us, however, no such evidence exist; the 
conspiracy is merely inferred from the acts of the accused in the perpetration 
of the crime. There is no proof how and when the plan to kill Melanio Balancio 
was hatched, or what time elapsed before it was carried out; we are, therefore, 
unable to determine if the appellants enjoyed "sufficient time between its 
inception and its fulfillment dispassionately to consider and accept the 
consequences." (cf. People <em>vs</em>. Bangug, 52 Phil. 91). In other words, 
there is no showing of the opportunity for reflection and the persistence in the 
criminal intent that characterize the aggravating circumstance of evident 
premeditation (People <em>vs</em>. Mendoza, 91 Phil., 58; People <em>vs</em>. 
Itturiaga, 47 Off. Gaz., (Supp. to No. 12) 166; People <em>vs</em>. Lasada, 70 
Phil. 525).</p>
<p>Our view is supported by the Sentencia of the Tribunal Supremo of Spain, 
dated 19 October 1933, wherein, speaking of evident premeditation, it held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Considerando que—no concurre si el veredicto solo expresa que previo 
concierto de voluntades, se ejecuto el acuerdo, sin concretar el tiempo 
transcurrido y los actos de deliberacion, reiterados y persistentes, precedents 
a la ejecucion del delito, pues aquella circunstancia requiere que la 
determinacion del agente de perpetrar el delito concebido se haya formado por 
medio de un raciocinio pleno y reflexivo, de manera tal que revele un proposito 
preserverante en su realizacion, debidamente exteriorizado y 
conocido."</p></blockquote>
<p>It follows that while the crime committed by appellants is murder, qualified 
by treachery, their guilt is attenuated by voluntary surrender. Hence, the 
correct penalty is the minimum provided by law, which is <em>reclusion 
temporal</em> in its maximum degree (Article 248, R.P.C.), i.e. from 17 years, 4 
months and one day to 20 years of imprisonment. Giving them the benefits of the 
Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act 4103, section 2), the appellants should be and 
are hereby sentenced to not less than ten (10) years and one (1) day of 
<em>prision mayor</em> and not more than eighteen (18) years of <em>reclusion 
temporal</em>, plus the corresponding accessory penalties (People <em>vs</em>. 
Ducosin, 59 Phil. 109).</p>
<p>Modified as to the penalty, in the sense indicated, the judgment appealed 
from is otherwise affirmed. Costs against appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
