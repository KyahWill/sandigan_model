				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendant-appellant Eugenio Olaes, together with Cosme Isip and&nbsp; Bienvenido Dayuta, who where then at large and five other men, unidentified and also&nbsp; at large, were accused of the crime of attempted robbery with homicide and frustrated homicide before the Court of First Instance of Rizal. Olaes was the only one who stood trial, after which he was found guilty of robbery with homicide and frustrated homicide and sentenced as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the accused Eugenio&nbsp; Olaes is hereby declared guilty of robbery with homicide and frustrated&nbsp; homicide defined and penalized in Article 294, Case&nbsp; No. 1, Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Although the crime was attended by&nbsp; the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and in band, in&nbsp; view of the attitude of the Chief Executive on death penalty,&nbsp; the accused is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment, to indemnify the heirs of Maria Argame in&nbsp; the sum of P6,000 without subsidiary imprisonment&nbsp; in case&nbsp; of insolvency, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; In the service of his sentence, the accused should be credited with one-half of the period of preventive imprisonment suffered by him since&nbsp; January 24, 1955."<br></blockquote>Because of the penalty imposed, the appeal of Olaes was taken directly to this Court.<br><br>The facts in this case as established by the evidence and found by the trial court are the following: Between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. of November&nbsp; 9, 1954, Bus No. 64 of the Laguna Transportation&nbsp; Company, driven by one Feliciano Limosnero,&nbsp; with one conductor,&nbsp; left the&nbsp; town plaza of Biñan, Laguna,&nbsp; bound for Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the passengers were&nbsp; Mariano&nbsp; Inobio,&nbsp; a resident&nbsp; of&nbsp; Bo.&nbsp; Almanza,&nbsp; Las Piñas,&nbsp; Rizal, Maria Argame and Elena Loyola.&nbsp; When the bus reached&nbsp; the curve in Bo. Almanza,&nbsp; Las Piñas, a man later identified by passenger Inobio as Cosme Isip, holding a rifle or carbine, suddenly appeared on the right&nbsp; side of the road and signalled the bus to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Limosnero, taking him for&nbsp; a prospective passenger, applied his brakes&nbsp; and slowed down, but before the&nbsp; vehicle could come to&nbsp; a complete stop, seven other men,&nbsp; also&nbsp; carrying guns, such as, garands&nbsp; or&nbsp; carbines,&nbsp; emerged from the left&nbsp; side&nbsp; of the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isip&nbsp; shouted,&nbsp; "Para, pasok!"&nbsp; The&nbsp; appearance of these armed men on both sides&nbsp; of the road must&nbsp; have affected the&nbsp; equanimity&nbsp; of Limosnero&nbsp; on the&nbsp; wheel,&nbsp; and he must&nbsp; have forgotten to press the clutch with his foot, resulting in&nbsp; the&nbsp; engine stalling or&nbsp; stopping.&nbsp; Probably convinced that the eight men were&nbsp; net passengers but were&nbsp; bent&nbsp; on holding-up the bus&nbsp; and robbing the passengers, Limosnero started the engine&nbsp; and sped away from the place despite the shouts of the men on both sides of the road for him to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those men immediately commenced firing at the bus&nbsp; which was riddled with bullets.<br><br>One of the shots grazed the head of Limosnero.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another shot hit passenger Maria Argame&nbsp; on the back, the slug penetrating the abdominal wall and entering the abdominal cavity.&nbsp; Still another shot&nbsp; struck passenger Elena Loyola on the shoulder, fracturing her right clavicle.&nbsp; When the bus was out of range of the guns of the eight men&nbsp; on the road and they had ceased firing, passenger Inobio on rising from his prone position in the bus, saw driver Limosnero's wound on the head, which was bleeding profusely, the blood dimming his vision,&nbsp; and so he took over the wheel.&nbsp; On reaching Zapote,&nbsp; an&nbsp; inspector of the&nbsp; Laguna Transportation&nbsp; Company took over the wheel from Inobio and drove the bus straight to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Las Pinas&nbsp; Municipal Building where the incident and shooting was reported to the police. Thereafter, the same&nbsp; bus, with&nbsp; a&nbsp; police officer, drove straight to Manila and to the Philippine General Hospital. Maria Argame was pronounced dead on arrival.&nbsp; The fracture of&nbsp; the right clavicle of Elena&nbsp; Loyola necessitated an operation,&nbsp; which&nbsp; was performed, and she was confined&nbsp; in the hospital&nbsp; for about twenty days, after which she was discharged, though she was not&nbsp; completely&nbsp; recovered,&nbsp; to continue treatment at home.&nbsp; The expert testimony&nbsp; on her condition is that if she had not been given prompt medical attention, she would have&nbsp; died from&nbsp; her wound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Driver Limosnero&nbsp; was treated at the same hospital for his head would and was released, but treatment was&nbsp; continued by the bus company for about a month.<br><br>During the trial, passenger Inobio,&nbsp; star witness for the Government, told the court that he clearly&nbsp; identified the person standing on the right side of the road, who signalled the bus to stop and who cried out "Para, pasok!" as Cosme Isip.&nbsp; Inobio also&nbsp; said&nbsp; that among the seven armed men who emerged from the left side of the road and who fired at the bus when&nbsp; it sped away, he saw and clearly identified defendant-appellant Olaes, because he is a barriomate, both of them being residents&nbsp; of Bo. Almanza, Las&nbsp; Piñas and that Olaes was then&nbsp; carrying&nbsp; a&nbsp; gun, either a garand or a carbine.<br><br>Appellant Olaes at the trial insisted that he&nbsp; was not in the group of men that supposedly tried to hold&nbsp; up the bus, much less was he seen by Inobio because in the course of the investigation made by&nbsp; the municipal&nbsp; police&nbsp; and the Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary, on two&nbsp; occasions when he&nbsp; was present, and while Inobio&nbsp; was making statements to the authorities,&nbsp; Inobio never mentioned&nbsp; his&nbsp; name much less pointed&nbsp; to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence, however, shows that the failure&nbsp; of Inobio to point to appellant as one of the supposed hold-uppers and who stopped&nbsp; the&nbsp; bus was because of fear&nbsp; of reprisal, believing that Olaes&nbsp; was a dangerous character.&nbsp; Appellant also tried to&nbsp; establish a motive or reason for Inobio's accusing him.&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote with favor the pertinent portions of the decision of the trial court on this point:<br><blockquote>"He (Olaes) further averred that a poljeeman from&nbsp; Las&nbsp; Pinas investigated the holdup at&nbsp; 7:30 o'clock in the morning&nbsp; of November 9; that during the questioning of Inobio, Inobio never implicated him, although&nbsp; he was present for some twenty&nbsp; minutes; that at around 1:00 p.m. while on his way home, he met&nbsp; a PC team&nbsp; investigating the crime headed by then Lt. Ver, whom&nbsp; he led to&nbsp; the house of Mariano&nbsp; Inobio; that in the course of the questioning of Inobio which lasted for about half an liour, Inobio never made mention of his (accused's) name and told the PC that he did not&nbsp; recognize the persons who attempted to waylay the bus and hold-up its passengers. When asked for a possible motive why Inobio should testify against him the way he did, the accused narrated that in May, 1954, he tried to pacify and separate Inobio and Dayuta who were quarreling; that as Inobio struggled against him, he encircled Inobio's neck with the arm; that&nbsp; Inobio&nbsp; resented this and&nbsp; accused him&nbsp; of siding with Dayuta;&nbsp; that shortly, Inobio left muttering, "Your day of reckoning will come; you will&nbsp; pay for this"; that from that time on, he&nbsp; and Inobio had strained relations.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"Much stress is laid on Inobio's failure&nbsp; to pinpoint Olaes during the investigation conducted by Lt.&nbsp; Ver of&nbsp; the PC at 2:00 p.m., November&nbsp; 9, 1954.&nbsp; But as explained&nbsp; by&nbsp; Inobio, he did not point to Olaes&nbsp; who was there present as he was afraid of reprisal against himself and members of his family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, two hours later,&nbsp; and feeling secure in the municipal building, he&nbsp; revealed the names of Eugenio&nbsp; Olaes, Bienvenido Dayuta and Cosme Isip&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; chief of police of Las Piñas.<br><br>"Moreover, PC Capt. Ver testifying on rebuttal declared that when he&nbsp; questioned Inobio in his house, in the presence of Olaes, Inobio appeared nervous; that he took him upstairs and during the&nbsp; interrogation, a PC detachment commander investigating the same offense came&nbsp; and advised him&nbsp; (Ver)&nbsp; that Inobio&nbsp; already&nbsp; revealed to&nbsp; him that morning that Olaes was among the hold-uppers;&nbsp; that at&nbsp; this juncture, Inobio informed him&nbsp; (Ver) that that man was his guide and companion who remained&nbsp; downstairs; that when they looked at&nbsp; the place&nbsp; where they had left&nbsp; Olaes, the&nbsp; latter was&nbsp; nowhere to be found, having slipped away&nbsp; unnoticed."<br></blockquote>Defendant-appellant also&nbsp; interposed the defense of&nbsp; alibi. We also reproduce that portion of the decision of the trial court on this point.<br><blockquote>"The defense&nbsp; of&nbsp; alibi must&nbsp; be&nbsp; clearly and&nbsp; satisfactorily proven (People <i>vs.</i> Limbo, 49 Phil., 94).&nbsp; The testimony of the&nbsp; accused that he slept in the house of his father or brother on the night of November 8 does not preclude the possibility that he woke&nbsp; up at, say 3:00 or&nbsp; 4:00&nbsp; o'clock&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; early morning&nbsp; of the&nbsp; next&nbsp; day and joined the band of armed men who at 4; 30 were frustrated in their nefarious&nbsp; plan to waylay the&nbsp; bus&nbsp; and rob its passengers,&nbsp; considering the fact&nbsp; that the houses of his father&nbsp; and.brother&nbsp; are situated in the same barrio&nbsp; where&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; was committed&nbsp; (See People <i>vs.</i> Palamos, 49 Phil., 601).&nbsp; Moreover, the father and/or brother of the accused were available to him&nbsp; at&nbsp; all times to&nbsp; testify in his behalf and corroborate his alibi that he slept in his house that night.&nbsp; This was not&nbsp; done and no plausible&nbsp; explanation given why these corroborative&nbsp; witnesses were not presented&nbsp; (People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Pili, 52&nbsp; Phil., 965),"<br></blockquote>After a careful study of the&nbsp; case, we fully agree with the trial court that defendant Eugenio&nbsp; Olaes&nbsp; is&nbsp; guilty. However, it will be remembered that the charge against him was for attempted robbery&nbsp; with homicide and frustrated homicide.&nbsp; Under this charge, as the Solicitor General well said,&nbsp; he may not be convicted&nbsp; of consummated robbery with homicide as&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court did.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; we agree with&nbsp; the prosecution that&nbsp; inasmuch as no overt&nbsp; acts pointing to robbery or even an attempt thereof have&nbsp; been&nbsp; established, the&nbsp; killing of one passenger and the&nbsp; wounding of two others should be considered as plain murder, frustrated&nbsp; murder, and physical injuries respectively. &nbsp;<br><br>The trial court&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; aggravating&nbsp; circumstances of nocturnity and <i>in band</i>, there being more than three armed men in the group of malefactors, attended the commission of the crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The aggravating circumstance of in band may be considered to qualify the act of killing of Maria as murder, and the wounding of Elena as frustrated murder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence for the defense&nbsp; was to the effect that appellant surrendered to the authorities when&nbsp; he&nbsp; found out&nbsp; that he was wanted&nbsp; by the constabulary. This was not refuted by the prosecution and so, it can be regarded as&nbsp; a&nbsp; fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; This mitigating circumstance will compensate the other aggravating circumstance of nocturnity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The penalty for murder which, is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> in its&nbsp; maximum degree to death, should therefore be imposed in&nbsp; its medium period, namely&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua, </span>so that in the result, we agree with the trial court as to the penalty imposed by it.<br><br>However,&nbsp; we disagree with the lower court as to the reason given by it in imposing the penalty in its medium degree, namely, that "although the crime&nbsp; was attended by the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and in band, in view of the attitude of the Chief Executive on death penalty", the accused was sentenced&nbsp; only&nbsp; to life imprisonment.&nbsp; Without attempting, even desiring to ascertain the veracity&nbsp; or trueness of the alleged&nbsp; attitude of the. Chief Executive on the application of the death&nbsp; penalty,&nbsp; the courts of the land will interpret and apply the laws as they find them on the&nbsp; statute books,&nbsp; regardless of the manner their judgments&nbsp; are executed&nbsp; and. implemented&nbsp; by the executive department.&nbsp; By doing so, the courts will have complied with their&nbsp; solemn duty&nbsp; to administer&nbsp; justice. Until the Legislature sees fit to repeal or modify the imposition of&nbsp; the extreme penalty, the courts will continue to impose the same when the facts&nbsp; and circumstances in a case so warrant.<br><br>For the crime of frustrated murder, appellant is hereby sentenced to not less than six (6) years of <i>prision correctional</i> and not more than fourteen&nbsp; (14)&nbsp; years of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, with the accessories of the&nbsp; law.<br><br>As to the physical injuries, the evidence shows that the period within which the injuries on the head of Limosnero were treated was&nbsp; less than 30 days, for which reason, the offense as&nbsp; to&nbsp; him should be considered as less&nbsp; serious physical injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this, appellant is hereby sentenced to three (3) months of arresto mayor.<br><br>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing, with the modifications above indicated, the&nbsp; appealed decision&nbsp; is hereby affirmed, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
