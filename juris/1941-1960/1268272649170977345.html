				G.R. No. L-2035, August 23, 1949</h4>
				<H3>ANGELITA V. VILLANUEVA AND PABLO C. SANIDAD, PETITIONERS, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF POSTS, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Before the war the petitioner Angelita V. Villanueva maintained 
a savings deposit with the Philippine Postal Savings Bank, which as of October 
22, 1941, had a balance in her favor of P4.60. She made no further deposit in 
said account until the month of October, 1944. Between the 10th and the 31st of 
said month she made four deposits totalling P5,940.
<p align="justify">The Director of Posts refused to recognize the validity of that 
deposit made during the occupation in Japanese military notes on the ground that 
it had been declared invalid by Executive Order No. 49, series of 1945. </p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner, assisted by her husband, seeks to compel the 
Director of Posts to recognize the validity of said deposit, contending that 
Executive Order No. 49 is unconstitutional in that it deprives her of her 
property without due process of law.</p>
<p align="justify">That question has been resolved by this court adversely to the 
petitioner in Hilado vs. De la Costa and the Philippine National Bank, G. R. No. 
L-150, April 30, 1949,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> wherein it was 
held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We are of the considered opinion, and therefore hold, that the 
provisions of Executive Order No. 49, do not deprive the plaintiff of his 
property without due process of law or impair the obligation of contract entered 
into between him and defendant bank; because they are but the logical corollary 
and application to bank deposits in Japanese war notes of Executive Order No. 
25, in so far as it declares that said notes are not legal tender in territories 
of the Philippines liberated from Japanese occupation, the validity of which is 
not, and cannot seriously be, questioned.</p>
<p align="justify">"It may safely be laid down as a rule that when a deposit is 
made with a bank or a person of notes made legal tender or currency by the 
military occupant of an enemy territory, and the occupation does not ripen into 
a conquest by the occupant because the territory is liberated and reoccupied by 
its legitimate government, the deposit must be considered as with specification 
of currency, that is, as a deposit of money made legal tender or currency by the 
occupant, without necessity of stating it expressly, unless there is evidence to 
the contrary, because it is the only kind of money or legal cur rency in 
circulation after the genuine money of the territory has disappeared from 
circulation, as in the present case. It should not be understood to be a general 
deposit without specification of currency, that is, a deposit of lawful money of 
the legitimate government, and it will have the same effect as if it were made 
with money that was legal tender or currency of a foreign country having no 
monetary treaty of agreement with the legitimate government; and therefore if 
such currency becomes valueless, the depositor shall have to suffer the loss, 
because the currency so deposited is exactly of the same condition and validity 
as that kept in the pockets or safe of the depositor."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The petition is denied, without any finding as to costs.</p>
