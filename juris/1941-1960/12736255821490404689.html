				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition to review on certiorari the decision of the Court 
of Industrial relations dated September 20, 1952, which, on motion for 
reconsideration by the herein petitioners, was confirmed unanimously by 
said court <em>in banc</em>, in its resolution dated October 22, 1952, which reads as follows:
<p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"This is a motion for reconsideration of the order of this Court, 
dated September 20, 1952, filed by the counsel for the petitioners on 
September 29, 1952. After a careful perusal of the evidence as well as 
the arguments of both parties, the Court<em> in banc</em> fails to find sufficient justification for altering or modifying the aforesaid order.</p>
  <p>"MOTION DENIED.<br>
"Manila, Philippines, October 22, 1952." (p.7 Rec.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the lenghty statement of facts made by the court of industrial 
Relations in said order of September 20, 1952, we gather the following 
data:</p>
<p>On January 10, 1948, at 3 o'clock on the afternoon, the petitioners, 
through the president of their union, Ramon A. Honorico, presented to 
the Batangas Transportation Co., respondent herein, a set of demands. 
The next day, January, at 8 o'clock in the morning, a strike was 
declared by the petitioners, which completely paralized the 
transportation business of the Company. On January 13, 1948, the Company
 filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations, praying, among
 other things, that the employees and workers belonging to the union of 
the herein petitionersn be ordered to return to work immediately and in 
the event of refusal or failure to do so, the Company be authorized to 
dismiss them and to hire in their stead other employees in order not to 
interrupt the business of the Company, especially that of carrying the 
mails. The case was set for hearing on January 15, at 9 o'clock in the 
morning. Neither the president nor any member of the board of directors 
of the union appeared. The court after taking the testimony of the 
manager of the Company, issued an order on the same date requiring the 
workers who had walked out in the morning of July 11, to return to work 
within forty-eight hours after receipt of said order by the president or
 by any responsible official of the union, and authorizing the Company 
to employ other persons should the strikers fail to return to work. The 
company was likewise ordered to refrain from dismissing any worker 
without the previous consent of the Court. The officers of the union 
evaded the service of said order. On January 27, 1948, the court issued a
 notice hearing for February 2. Although no representative of the union 
appeared at said hearing, the court, considering the conciliatory 
attitude of the counsel of the Company, extended the period of 
forty-eight hours within which the workers should return to work, with 
the warning that, should they fail to do so, the order of January 15 
would be enforced. The officers of the union again evaded the service of
 the new order. Through the intervention of the Governor of batangas, a conference 
was scheduleed to be held on February 7 in the premises of the court. 
Nothing came out of this conference, and it was reset for February 14, 
which also was a failure. Finally, after a prolonged stalling and 
dilly-dallying on the part of the petitioners, Pelagio Potencio, 
purporting to represent the Company, and Ramon A, honorico, the 
president of the BAGONG PAGKAKAISA association, representing the 
strikers, entered into an agreement marked exhibit "A" in the record, 
which reads as foloows:

<p><br>
The herein petitioners afterwards filed a petition asking the Court of 
Industrial Relations to order the performance of said agreement. The 
Industrial Court denied the petition for the reasons stated in its order
 of September 20, 1952, above mentioned. The petitioners filed a motion 
for reconsideration which was denied unanimously by the court<em> in banc</em> on October 22.</p>
<p>The fact is that Pelagio Potenciano had not been authorized by the 
Company to represent it, nor to enter into such agreement. This is a 
finding of fact made by the Court of Industrial Relations which we 
cannot review, especially as it appears from the agreement itself which 
contains the following paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"IKATLO, ipinangangako ng panig ng puhunan (Dr. PELAGIO POTENCIANO)
 na ang pangsama ntalang pagpipigil, sa labing pitong (17) katao ay sa 
loob ng isang (1) bwan ay gagawin niya ang paraan upang ang lahat ng mga
 ito ay mabalik sa kanilang mga gawaing dati sa lob ng pagawaan ng B.T.

  <p>"IKAPAT, ipinangangako din ng panig ng puhunan na kung sakali at

 ng isang buwan ay may pananagutan siya sa pangulo ng KAP. BAGONG 
PAGKAKAISA, RAMON A. HONORICO, sa paghahabol nito;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing to show, according to the findings of the Court of 
Industrial Relations, that the Company ratrified expressly or impliedly 
the unauthorized acts of Potencio.</p>
<p>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the petition is hereby denied with costs against the petitioners.</p>
<p>SO ORDERED.</p><p><i>Paras, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, </i>and <i>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</i>, concur.<br></p></div>
