				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 16, 1956, the plaintiff Rosendo Lequigan filed with the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Negros Occidental a complaint for injunction and&nbsp; damages against defendants Pedro, Quintin, Rosela, Otelia, all surnamed Katalbas, and the spouses Jovito and Constancia Carmales, docketed in said court as Civil Case No. 4095.&nbsp; Among other things, plaintiff's complaint alleges that he is the lawful possessor and actual&nbsp; occupant of a parcel of land described therein; that&nbsp; defendants have, since 1947, repeatedly disturbed and molested him in his free use and&nbsp; enjoyment of the property; and that, by reason of such intrusions, several criminal complaints&nbsp; were filed,&nbsp; some decided&nbsp; adversely against them, others&nbsp; resulting in&nbsp; acquittal and one still pending.&nbsp; Plaintiff, therefore, prays that his peaceful possession over&nbsp; the&nbsp; property in&nbsp; question&nbsp; be recognized by defendants; that&nbsp; a permanent injunction issue enjoining them from further molesting&nbsp; and disturbing him in his possession; that defendants, spouses Jovito and Constancia Carmales,&nbsp; be ordered to remove their&nbsp; house built on the said&nbsp; property; and&nbsp; finally,&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; be&nbsp; awarded damages and such other relief as may be due him under the premises.<br><br>In due time, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; (1) the&nbsp; complaint states no&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; action,&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; the cause of action, if any, is barred by the Statute of Limitations, and (3)&nbsp; the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit.&nbsp; An opposition&nbsp; to&nbsp; this motion was&nbsp; interposed&nbsp; by&nbsp; plaintiff's counsel.<br><br>Acting favorably on the&nbsp; aforesaid&nbsp; motion, the&nbsp; lower court, in an&nbsp; order dated November 27, 1956,&nbsp; dismissed the complaint in this wise:<br><blockquote>"Acting on the motion to dismiss dated November&nbsp; 12, 1956, filer by Atty. Januario L. Jison, for the defendants, and the opposition thereto dated November 23,&nbsp; 1956 filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; Attys. Tupas and del Castillo, for&nbsp; the plaintiff, this&nbsp; Court, finding said&nbsp; motion well founded, hereby grants the same,&nbsp; and&nbsp; order this case dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs."&nbsp; (Rec. App. 50-51)<br></blockquote>Against this order, plaintiff perfected an appeal to this Court.<br><br>The&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; must&nbsp; be&nbsp; sustained.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; avers that plaintiff is&nbsp; in the actual and&nbsp; peaceful possession of the property described therein, subsequent to&nbsp; plaintiff's application&nbsp; for a&nbsp; residence permit with the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Forestry in&nbsp; 1924, a&nbsp; sales application with&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands&nbsp; in 1927, and a free patent application in 1954 and that defendants have been and are continuously and unlawfully interfering1 with his&nbsp; physical&nbsp; and&nbsp; peaceful occupation of the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of allegation that&nbsp; the Bureau of&nbsp; Lands had already made an award on&nbsp; these applications or&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; an entry does not justify defendants'&nbsp; interference with&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; occupancy.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to be noted that plaintiff seeks not a recognition of title or ownership, but of his prior actual possession over the same, which the law and the courts protect&nbsp; against subsequent and baseless&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of dispossession,&nbsp; in order&nbsp; to prevent or&nbsp; settle&nbsp; disorders&nbsp; of breaches&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace.&nbsp; "Possession of a piece of property may wholly be&nbsp; precarious of unrighteous, yet if me possessor has in his&nbsp; favor priority of&nbsp; time, he has the&nbsp; security, that he is entitled to stay on the property until he&nbsp; is&nbsp; lawfully&nbsp; ejected by a person having a better right."&nbsp; (Mediran <i>vs.</i> Villanueva, [Syllabus,]&nbsp; 37 Phil.,&nbsp; 752)<br><br>In a prior case, the question arose as to whether&nbsp; or not a public land applicant may be considered&nbsp; as having any right&nbsp; to the land&nbsp; occupied before&nbsp; award thereof,&nbsp; which may entitle him to&nbsp; a possessory&nbsp; action.&nbsp; In&nbsp; answering the query in the affirmative, this Court ruled:<br><blockquote>"There are compelling reasons of policy supporting1 the recognition of&nbsp; a right in a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona, fide</span> applicant who has occupied the land applied&nbsp; for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognition of the right encourages actual settlement; it discourages speculation and land-grabbing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in accord with well established practices in the&nbsp; United State's.&nbsp; It&nbsp; prevents conflicts and the overlapping&nbsp; of claims.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; an&nbsp; act&nbsp; of&nbsp; simple&nbsp; justice to the enterprise and diligence&nbsp; of the pioneer, without which land settlement can not be encouraged&nbsp; or emigration from thickly populated areas hastened.<br><br>Our&nbsp; answer to the second problem is also&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; affirmative, and we hold that even pending the investigation of, and resolution on, an&nbsp; application by a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> occupant, such&nbsp; as plaintiff-appellee herein, by the priority of his application and record oi his&nbsp; entry, he acquires a right&nbsp; to the possession of the public&nbsp; land he applied for&nbsp; against any&nbsp; other public&nbsp; land applicant, which right&nbsp; may be protected by&nbsp; the possessory action&nbsp; of forcible entry&nbsp; or&nbsp; by any other&nbsp; suitable&nbsp; remedy that&nbsp; our&nbsp; rules provide."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Andres Pitargue <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Leandro&nbsp; Sorilla, 92 Phil., 5;&nbsp; 48&nbsp; Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [9],&nbsp; 3849; 'see also Bohayang <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Maceren, et al., 53 Off. Gaz. No. 13, 4105.)<br></blockquote>On&nbsp; the question of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court's&nbsp; jurisdiction over the case,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; further held:<br><blockquote>"Resuming&nbsp; the consideration we have&nbsp; set&nbsp; forth&nbsp; above, we hold that the&nbsp; grant of power and duty&nbsp; to the Lands&nbsp; Department&nbsp; to alienate and dispose of public lands does not divest the courts of their&nbsp; duty&nbsp; or power to take cognizance of actions instituted by settlers or occupants or applicants against others to protect their respective&nbsp; possessions and occupations, more&nbsp; especially&nbsp; the actions of trespass,&nbsp; forcible entry&nbsp; and&nbsp; unlawful&nbsp; detainer, and&nbsp; that the exercise of&nbsp; such jurisdiction,&nbsp; and control&nbsp; of&nbsp; public lands.&nbsp; The question we&nbsp; have proposed&nbsp; to consider must be answered&nbsp; in the affirmative."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pitargue <i>vs.</i> Sorilla, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.)<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is contended that the&nbsp; patent&nbsp; application&nbsp; made only in&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; was illegal because public lands in Negros are no&nbsp; longer open for patent application after&nbsp; December 31, 1938&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp; section 45&nbsp; of the Public Land&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; Besides the fact that the principle of protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; prior possession&nbsp; or&nbsp; occupation against&nbsp; subsequent ones&nbsp; not showing a better&nbsp; right&nbsp; (as already mentioned above) would&nbsp; have sufficed to dispose of this&nbsp; assertion.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well to remember&nbsp; that the section cited&nbsp; by the&nbsp; defendants was&nbsp; later amended by&nbsp; Republic Act No. 107 enacted in 1947, which extended the privilege to file&nbsp; applications&nbsp; to not later than December 31,&nbsp; 1957 (see&nbsp; also Proclamation No.&nbsp; 70,&nbsp; series of 1948 of the President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; declaring all regions opened to free&nbsp; patent up to December 31, 1957). At any rate, it is only the government that can question plaintiff's entry&nbsp; and&nbsp; occupancy&nbsp; of&nbsp; lands of&nbsp; the public domain.<br><br>Lastly,&nbsp; defendants assail the&nbsp; action for&nbsp; damages, in that&nbsp; the&nbsp; same is&nbsp; unauthorized&nbsp; under&nbsp; article 33<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Civil Code of the Philippines, and that, moreover, assuming&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; sanctioned,&nbsp; it had already prescribed,&nbsp; invoking articles 1146<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1149<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Code.<br><br>This&nbsp; contention is, however, premised on the&nbsp; wrong assumption&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; suit is&nbsp; based on the criminal convictions of some of the&nbsp; defendants years before&nbsp; this suit&nbsp; was filed.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp; not so, for, as stated by&nbsp; the plaintiff, the complaint is based on the continuous and repeated acts&nbsp; of dispossession of defendants, which&nbsp; acts are sought to be enjoined&nbsp; in the case.<br><br>Wherefore, the order of dismissal appealed from is hereby reversed, and the case ordered remanded for further proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs&nbsp;&nbsp; against&nbsp;&nbsp; defendants-appellees.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador</i>, and&nbsp; <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Art. 33. In cases of defamation, fraud, and physical injuries, a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party, Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution, and shall require only a proponderance&nbsp; of evidence<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Art. 1146. The following actions must be instituted within four years:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Upon an injury to the rights of the plaintiff;<br>(2) Upon a quasi-delict.<br></div><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Art. 1149. All other actions whose periods are not fixed in this Code or in other laws must be brought within five years from the time the right of action accrues.<br></div>
