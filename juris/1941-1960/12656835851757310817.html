				<H3>BERNARDO TORRES, PROTESTANT AND APPELLANT, VS. MAMERTO S. RIBO AND ALEJANDRO BALDERIAN, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Leyte 
dismissing a motion of protest for provincial governor on the alleged ground 
that the motion was filed out of time. The question turns upon whether the 
period for filing the protest should be cojanted from the 22nd or from the 24th 
of November, 1947. The court below used the first date as the starting point of 
computation.
<p>The pertinent facts are these: The protestant, Bernardo Torres, and the 
defendants, Mamerto S. Ribo and Alejandro Balderian, were opposing candidates 
for provincial governor of Leyte in the general elections held on November 11, 
1947. As Mamerto S. Ribo, who was provincial governor, and the two members of 
the provincial board were candidates, they were disqualified to form parts of 
the provincial board of canvassers of which they were to be members under 
section 158 of the Revised Election Code. Consequently, and in pursuance of 
Section 159, the commission on elections, in a telegram to the provincial 
treasurer dated November 20 and received on November 21 in Tacloban, Leyte, 
appointed the division superintendent of schools, the district engineer and the 
district health officer to replace the disqualified members, with advice that 
they might assume office upon receipt of their appointments. It so happened that 
the division superintendent of schools and the district engineer were on that 
date on the west coast of the province and did not return to Tacloban until the 
24th. In the meantime, on November 22, F. Martinez, provincial treasurer, as 
chairman, Gregorio Abogado, provincial fiscal, Vicente Tizon, <em>assistant 
civil engineer</em> in the district engineer's office, Evaristo Pascual, 
<em>chief clerk</em> in the office of the division superintendent of schools, 
and W. Enage, acting district health officer, canvassed the votes for provincial 
governor and other officers and proclaimed Mamerto S. Ribo as Governor-elect." 
Vicente Tizon and Evaristo Pascual sat as members "representing the district 
engineer and the division superintendent of schools respectively.</p>
<p>On November 24, 1947, the provincial board of canvassers again met, the 
meeting this time being attended by the provincial treasurer, the provincial 
fiscal the district health officer, the division superintendent of schools, the 
district engineer and the provincial auditor. In that meeting the board made a 
new canvass of the votes and proclaimed Mamerto S. Ribo elected to the office of 
provincial governor.</p>
<p>Were assistant civil engineer Vicente Tizon and chief clerk Evaristo Pascual 
lawful members of the provincial "board of canvassers? Judge Victoriano who 
first took cognizance of the case decided this question in the negative. On a 
motion for reconsideration Judge Edmundo Piccio, another judge sitting in 
Tacloban, reversed Judge Victoriano1s order. Judge Piccio said, "Verily it would 
be absurd to suppose that in this kind of official commitments, the District 
Engineer, the Division Superintendent of Schools could not be represented by 
their Assistants who are in themselves competent and qualified persons, * * * it 
is unreasonable to sustain the argument that the District Engineer and the 
Division Superintendent of Schools could not delegate their prerogatives because 
as contended, this power or prerogative belongs exclusively to the Commission on 
Elections."</p>
<p>A statement in Judge Piccio's decision needs correction although the point, 
in our view of the case, is not material. It does not appear, and there is no 
pretense on the part of the protestee, that the division superintendent of 
schools and the district engineer delegated their authority to Pascual and 
Tizon. Upon whose instance or suggestion these two presumed to act in 
representation of their chiefs is not shown.</p>
<p>Section 158 of the Revised Election Code designates the officers who are to 
comprise the provincial board of canvassers, and section 159 enumerates the 
officers to be appointed substitute members by the commission on elections in 
case of the absence or incapacity of any of the members named in the next 
preceding section. They are the division superintendent of schools, the district 
engineer, the district health officer, the register of deeds, the clerk of the 
court of First Instance, and the justice of the peace of the provincial 
capital.</p>
<p>This express enumeration excludes other officers, <em>Expresio unius est 
exclusio alterius</em>. Not even the commission on elections may lawfully 
appoint any person or officer outside of those mentioned. Much less may any one 
other than these officers act as member of the provincial board of canvassers by 
delegation by a substitute member, by the indication of other members of the 
board, or of his own volition. The appointment of a substitute member is 
personal and restricted and his powers must be performed directly and in person 
by the appointee. To hold otherwise would be to authorize the appointment, say, 
by the provincial treasurer, the provincial auditor, or the provincial fiscal of 
another person to act in his stead and thus take away from the hands of the 
Commission on Elections the authority to appoint under section 159.</p>
<p>An officer to whom a discretion is entrusted can not delegate it to another. 
The powers of the board of canvassers are not purely ministerial, as the court 
below erroneously holds. The board exercises quasi judicial functions, such as 
the function and duty to determine whether the papers transmitted to them are 
genuine election returns signed by the proper officers. Thus, where what 
purports to be two or more returns from the same municipality are received, the 
canvassing board must necessarily determine from the face of the papers which 
one shall be regarded as the true and genuine return. (20 C, J. 201-202.)</p>
<p>In truth, there was presented to the board on the 22nd a matter which 
required the use of judgment. It appears from the minutes of the meeting of that 
date that the returns from four municipalities were incomplete or entirely 
missing, so much so that in accordance with section 161 the provincial treasurer 
notified the provincial fiscal of that fact. The minutes read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The report of the Provincial Treasurer, dated November 21, 1947, to the 
Provincial Fiscal, regarding missing election returns in certain municipalities, 
that is not as yet received by the Provincial Treasurer, was read and considered 
by the Board. Also, certified statements by municipal treasurers of the 
municipalities concerned, showing the votes cast in their municipalities as 
shown in their (treasurers') copies of the election returns for which no copies 
for the provincial treasurer were yet received, are also presented. In order not 
to delay the canvassing, it was decided that such certified statements of the 
respective municipal treasurers bo takan at their face value in lieu of the 
missing election returns, municipalities effected are as 
follows:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>
<p>Hinunangan — (<em>a</em>) No elaction return for board members in Precinct 
No. 1. (<em>b</em>) No election return in Precinct No. 11.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Leyte — (<em>a</em>) No election return in Precinct No. 6 (<em>b</em>) No 
election return for board members in Precinct No.11. (Certified copies of those 
election returns were received from the office of the Municipal Treasurer in tho 
course of the session of the Board of Canvassers.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Pastrana — No election returns for governor and board members in Precinct 
No.1. (The missing returns were received from tho municipality in tho course of 
the session of the Board.)</p>
</li><li>Morida — No election return for board members in Precinct No. 10. </li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, the Provincial Treasurer informed the Board that efforts have 
been and are being exerted by his office to obtain said missing election 
returns. As soon as they are received, authenticity of the said municipal 
treasurers' statements will have to be considered from said 
returns.</p></blockquote>
<p>On this vital question Tizon and Pascual voted. This was not a ministerial or 
mechanical task. That the returns subsequently received tallied with the 
municipal treasurer's certificates does not cure the mistake committed.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the intervention of Tizon and Pascual in the canvass, we are 
of the belief that that canvass was premature and illegal. Section 162 of the 
Revised Election Code provides that "If it should clearly appear that some 
requisite in form has been omitted in the statements, the board shall return 
them by messenger or by another more expeditious means, to the corresponding 
board of canvassers for correction." The board had before it not defective 
returns but papers or documents that ware not returns at all.</p>
<p>The requirement of section 160 that "the provincial board of canvassers shall 
met as soon as possible within fifteen days next following the day of election" 
and that "as soon as all the statement s are before it but not later than 
fifteen days next following the date of the election, the provincial board of 
canvassers shall proceed to make a canvass of all the votes cast in the province 
for national, provincial and city candidates, etc," is merely directory (20 C.J. 199) and does not legalize the making and completing of the canvass before 
all the returns are in.</p>
<p>The protestee maintains that at any rate Pascual and Tizon were <em>de 
facto</em> officers. This contention is without any foundation in law. An 
officer <em>de facto</em> is one who has the reputation of being the officer he 
assumes to be, and yet is not a good officer in point of law. He must have acted 
as an officer for such a length of time, under color of title and under such 
circumstances of reputation or acquiescence by the public and public 
authorities, as to afford a presumption of appointment or election, and indues 
people, without inquiry, and relying on tho supposition that he is the officer 
he assumes to be, to submit to or invoke his action. (46 C. J. 1O53.)</p>
<p>Tizon and Pascual did not possess any of these conditions. They acted without 
appointment, commission or any color of title to the office. There was no 
acquiescene, public or private, in their discharge of the position. In fact the 
very person most greatly affected by their assumption of the office, Bernardo 
Torres, was not notified and was unaware of it.</p>
<p>Tizon and Pascual eliminated, there were only three lawful members sitting on 
the board of canvassers on November 22. Under section 159 of the Revised 
Election Code tho provincial board of canvassers is to be composed of six 
members — the provincial governor, the two members of the provincial board, the 
provincial treasurer, the provincial auditor and the provincial fiscal — subject 
to be replaced by the officers named in the same section in case of their 
absence or disability. The Revised Election Code does not state the number of 
the members of the canvassing board necessary to be present at the canvass. One 
court has held that when one member absents himself from, the session before 
completion of the canvass tha acts of tho remaining members of the board in 
completing the canvass and certifying the result were valid. (Ex parte Smith 
[Okl.] 154 page 521.) Some courts, however, have held that the canvassers can 
not act unless all are present. (Chumasero <em>vs</em>. .Patts, 2 Mont. 242 
[writ of error dismissed 92 U. S., 358; 23 L. ed. 499].)</p>
<p>We do not decide whether the presence of the six members of the board of 
canvassers is essential. We leave this question open. Whatever the law, it is 
our considered opinion that the presence of three members is not enough 
compliance with the law. If it were, two would be, and even one, There must at 
least be a quorum, which is a majority of all the members, or one half their 
number plus one. In the present case, four constitute a quorum. The decisions 
just cited are very helpful on the other aspect of the case. They serve to 
emphasize the importance attached to the office of member of the board of 
canvassers and the gravity and non-delegability of its functions and duties.</p>
<p>Upon the foregoing considerations, our is that the meeting of November 22, 
1947 of the provincial board of canvassers and the proclamation in that meeting 
of the protestee were illegal and of no affect. With this conclusion we refrain 
from discussing the other errors assigned by the appellant.</p>
<p>The appealed order will be reversed with costs against the appellees. It is 
so ordered.</p><em>Parás, Feria, Perfecto,</em> and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> 
concur. </div>
