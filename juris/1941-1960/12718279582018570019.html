				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Commission on Elections,  acting under the  authority of section 5  of  Commonwealth Act  No. 657,  adopted a  resolution providing for the appointment of election inspectors to be proposed by the political parties and  persons named therein.   One of  those  parties,  Pagkakaisa  Ng Bayan, of which petitioner is the President, claiming the exclusive right to propose the appointment of such inspectors, now seeks to nullify that  resolution on the ground that section 5  of Commonwealth Act No. 657 is  unconstitutional, in so far as it requires that a political  party must have polled  at least ten <span style="font-style: italic;">per  centum</span>  of  the  total number of  votes cast  in  the preceding election  in order to have the right to  propose the appointment of one inspector and his substitute.  Petitioner contends that this requirement of  section 5 is a subject  not  expressed in the title of the Act, and that its inclusion in that section  contravenes the provision of the Constitution that "No bill which  may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject which shall be expressed in the title of the  bill." Constitution, Article VI, section 21 (1).<br><br>Commonwealth Act No. 657 is entitled "An Act to reorganize the Commission on Elections."  It implements the provisions  of  the  Constitution by reorganizing the  Commission  on Elections created  under  Commonwealth Act No. 607, and  converting  it into  the Commission on  Elections established  under  Article  X of  the  Constitution. Among the powers conferred by the  Constitution on  the Commission on  Elections is that of deciding administrative  questions affecting the appointment of  election  inspectors; and section 5  of  Commonwealth Act No.  657 provides, among other things,  that "the Commission on Elections shall, directly or through its authorized provincial representatives, appoint  a board of election inspectors for each election  precinct, to be composed  of three  inspectors and  poll clerk."  It  further provides that  the appointment of one inspector  and his substitute and  the poll clerk and his substitute shall be proposed by the  party which polled the largest number of votes in the preceding election, and that the  appointment of another inspector  and his substitute shall be proposed by the party which polled the next largest number of  votes, if  the same  constitute at least ten <span style="font-style: italic;">per centum</span>  of the total number  of votes cast in the said election.<br><br>The constitutional  requirement that the subject of an act shall be expressed in its  title should be reasonably construed so  as not  to  interfere unduly  with the enactment of necessary legislation.  It should be given  a  practical  rather than  technical construction.  It should  be  a sufficient compliance  with such requirement if the  title expresses the  general subject and all the provisions of the statute are germane  to that general  subject.  As stated by the Supreme Court of the United States: "We must give the constitutional  provision a reasonable construction  and effect.  The constitution requires no law to embrace more than  one subject, which shall be expressed  in its title. Now  the object may be  very  comprehensive  and  still be without  objection, and the one before us is of that  character.  But it is  by no means  essential that every  end and means necessary or convenient for the accomplishment of the general object should be either referred to or necessarily indicated by the title.   All that can reasonably be required is, that the title shall not be made to cover legislation incongruous in itself, and which by no fair intendment can be considered as having a necessary or proper connection."  (Blair v. Chicago, 26 S.  Ct. 427, 201 U. S. 400, 50 L. ed. 801.)<br><br>It seems  evident, in the light of the  relevant provisions of the Constitution, that the challenged provision of section 5 of Commonwealth Act No. 657 has a necessary  and proper connection with the reorganization of the Commission on Elections, which is the subject expressed in the title of the Act.  Under the Constitution  the Commission on Elections is empowered to decide  administrative questions affecting the appointment of  election inspectors and other election officials, and the requirement that, to be  entitled  to  propose the appointment of one inspector and  his substitute, a political party must  have polled at least ten <span style="font-style: italic;">per centum</span> of the total number of votes cast in the preceding  election,  is germane to the general subject of the reorganization of the Commission on Elections.<br><br>We find no merit in petitioner's contention that, if its validity is upheld, section 5 of Commonwealth Act No. 657 wou!d have the effect of nullifying the decision of this court in G. R. No. 47940, Juan Sumulong vs. The Commission on Elections.   That decision involved controversies arising out of the elections held on  December 10, 1940.   It construed section 70 of the Election Code in the sense that it gave the Pagkakaisa Ng Bayan the right to propose an inspector for each  and every election precinct in the  municipality of Bauan,  Province of Batangas.   The judgment entered pursuant to that decision had long been executed when Commonwealth Act No.  657 was  approved.<br><br>It is  true that if the law had remained unchanged, the doctrine laid down in the  case mentioned would apply to future similar cases.  But there is no principle or rule of law which prevents the legislative from amending statutes merely because the interpretation given to such statute by the courts would be rendered nugatory.  Instances abound where legislative acts have either been repealed or amended after the courts have had occasion to interpret and apply them.  The question is one  of  power, and  it  cannot be seriously disputed that the organization of  the boards of election inspectors  is a proper subject for legislative cognizance.  Because of the theory of separation of the powers of government, it is a firmly established principle that the propriety, wisdom and expediency of legislation are  exclusively matters for  legislative determination.  The remedy against unwise legislation is  an appeal not  to  the courts, but to the people who elect the members of  the legislative body.<br><br>It remains to  consider  petitioner's contention that the resolution of the Commission on Elections, by giving the so-called rebel candidate or free-zone  faction of the  Nationalista Party  the right to propose one election inspector for each  of the precincts in each of the fifty-three legislative districts mentioned  in paragraph IV of the petition, contravenes section 5  of  Commonwealth Act  No. 657. He argues that under that section the Nationalista Party has the right to propose one,  and only one inspector for each precinct, and that  the  resolution has the effect of giving that party two inspectors in each and every precinct within those legislative districts.  The argument stems  from a misapprehension of the provisions of said section 5.   That section provides, among other things: First, that the appointment of one inspector and his substitute and the poll clerk and  his substitute shall  be proposed by the  party which polled the largest number of votes  at the preceding election; second,  that the appointment of another inspector and his  substitute  shall be proposed by  the party  which polled the  next  largest number of votes,  if  the same  constitute at least ten <span style="font-style: italic;">per centum</span> of the total number of votes cast in the said election; and third, that the third inspector and his  substitute  shall be chosen by  the Commission on Elections, and this  third inspector shall be the chairman of the board.  It also provides, that if the representatives  of the national directorates of political parties should fail  to propose the  names of persons to be appointed as election inspectors in their respective legislative districts, or if there be no political party entitled to propose the appointment  of any  inspectors, the  Commission shall, at  its discretion, choose said. inspectors and their substitutes.<br><br>In the instant case, it appears that in the fifty-three legislative districts  under consideration none of the minority parties  obtained in the  preceding  election the minimum number of  votes required to entitle it to propose the appointment of election inspectors. The question presented, therefore, is whether the Commission on Elections, in giving the so-called rebel candidates and free-zone factions  of the Nationalista Party the right to propose election inspectors for the fifty-three legislative districts, has acted within the limits of the discretion granted to it by law.  Petitioner maintains that  the discretion given by section 5  of  Commonwealth Act No. 657 to the Commission on Elections  in the choice of election inspectors where none of the minority parties  is entitled to propose the appointment of  such inspectors is not absolute, but limited  by the provision of the Act that the majority party shall have the right to propose only one inspector.  We think that  this is taking  a rather narrow view of the law.  We are inclined to take a more liberal view.<br><br>The Commission on  Elections is a constitutional  body. It is intended to play a distinct  and important part in our scheme  of government.  In the  discharge of its functions, it should  not be hampered with  restrictions that would  be fully warranted in the case of a less responsible organization.  The Commission  may err, so may this court also. It should be allowed considerable latitude in devising means and methods that will insure the  accomplishment of the great objective for which it was  created—free, orderly and honest elections.  We may not  agree  fully with its  choice of means, but unless these are clearly illegal or constitute gross abuse  of discretion, this, court should not interfere.<br><br>Politics is a practical matter, and political questions must be dealt with realistically—not from the standpoint of pure theory.  The Commission on Elections, because of its fact-finding facilities, its contacts with political strategists, and its  knowledge  derived from actual experience in  dealing with political controversies, is in a peculiarly advantageous position to decide complex political questions.<br><br>In the answer to the petition filed in this case, it is stated that in providing for the appointment of election inspectors for the fifty-three  legislative districts, the Commission on Elections took  into account the circumstances of each particular district, having considered, among other factors, the availability of teachers and other government employees and the strength of the opposing parties, factions and candidates; and adopted the following formula:<br><br><blockquote>"a. In districts where the majority party is not opposed by  any opposition  party of substantial political strength, and where the real opposition therein is represented by a candidate who  has proven his political strength  in the past according to the records of the Commission, said candidate is given the minority inspector, irrespective of his party.<br><br>"b. In districts  where the opposition  has not obtained at least 10 per cent of the total votes cast, but shows sufficient political strength as evidenced by the Commission's records, the minority inspector is given to such opposition party.<br><br>"c. In districts where the majority party is not opposed by  any opposition party nor  by any candidate of substantial strength, teachers are appointed as  minority  inspec tors.<br><br>"d. In districts where the opposition has not  shown any political  strength,  the minority inspector is denied  them in order to avoid the trafficking with the appointment of inspectors."<br></blockquote><br>There  are no  ready-made formulas for solving  public problems.  Time and experience are necessary to  evolve patterns that will serve the ends of good  government.  In the matter of the administration of the laws relative to the conduct of elections, as well as in the appointment of elec- tion inspectors,  we  must not by any excessive zeal take away from the Commission on Elections the initiative which by constitutional and legal  mandates properly belongs to it.  Due regard  to the independent character of the Commission,  as ordained in the  Constitution, requires that the power of this court to review the acts of that body should, as a general proposition,  be used sparingly,  but firmly in appropriate cases.  We are not satisfied that the present suit is one of such cases.<br><br>The order of  the  Commission  on Elections is  affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Diaz, Moran, and Horrilleno, JJ.</span>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><br><br>Ozaeta, J., concurring and dissenting:<br><br>I concur on the constitutionality of  section 5 of Com- monwealth Act No.  657, but dissent on the interpretation given by the Commission on Elections to said section for the same reasons stated in my dissenting  opinions in the cases of Vinzons vs. Commission on Elections, G.
