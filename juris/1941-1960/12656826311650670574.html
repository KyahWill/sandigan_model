				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the order of the Court of First Instance of Camarines 
Sur, which dismissed the action of the plaintiff and appellant on the ground 
that, according to the allegations in the complaint, said court has no 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, because from the plaintiff's 
complaint it appears that the action is of forcible entry, since the alleged 
illegal possession of the land in question by the defendants took place during 
the one year period provided for by section 1, Rule 72, of the Rules of Court, 
as contended by the attorney for the defendants in his petition for 
dismissal.
<p>Without necessity of discussing and passing upon the question raised in the 
first and second assignments of error that raise a question of procedure, we are 
of the opinion, and so hold, that the facts alleged in the complaint do not 
constitute an action of forcible entry but of recovery of possession of a land 
and damages, and therefore the action is within the jurisdiction of the Court of 
First Instance.</p>
<p>The complaint filed by the plaintiff-appellant with the Court of First 
Instance of Camarines Sur on June 15, 1946, alleges: </p>
<p>That "he is the owner of a parcel of land registered in his name under 
transfer certificate of title No. 76", and that "the defendants are occupying 
about 40 hectares more or less in the northern part of the plaintiff's land of 
251 hectares, lot No. 3, Plan No. PSU-14922, and are cultivating 20 hectares of 
the said 40 hectares. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"4.— That the defendants are occupying about 40 hectares, more or less, which 
is a part of the plaintiff's land lot No. 3, Plan PSU-14922, in the northern 
part and are cultivating about 20 hectares of that said 40 hectares, the value 
is P2,000. </p>
<p>"5.— That on or about the latter part of the year 1943, after the plaintiff 
had bought said land in question, the defendants were notified by the plaintiff 
that they give or pay. the corresponding share or rent of the land they were 
cultivating to the plaintiff herein as owner of said land, but the defendants 
not only refused and continue to refuse or give or pay the corresponding share 
or rent pertaining to the plaintiff herein as owner of the land, but also thru 
threats and intimidation prevented the plaintiff or any of his representative to 
take over the possession of that portion of the land in question. </p>
<p>"6.— That on or about the month of November, 1945, just after the harvest, 
the defendants thru force and intimidation compelled the overseer of the 
plaintiff herein to allow them to take and receive 24 cavanes of palay from one 
of the plaintiff's tenants who is cultivating that part of that 40 hectares of 
land they are occupying. </p>
<p>"7.— That notwithstanding repeated demands made by the plaintiff upon the 
defendants to vacate that portion of the land of the plaintiff detained by them, 
to return the 24 cavanes of palay to the plaintiff and to restore ithe 
possession thereof to the plaintiff, the said defendants refused and still 
continue to refuse to do so."</p></blockquote>
<p>Courts of First Instance have jurisdiction over all actions involving 
possession of land except cases of forcible entry and illegal detainer, and 
therefore the lower court has jurisdiction over the action alleged in the 
appellant's complaint, because it is not either lot illegal detainer or of 
forcible entry. It is not illegal detainer, for this consists in the withholding 
by a person from another, for more than one year, of the possession of a land or 
building to which the latter is entitled after the expiration or termination of 
the former's right to hold possession by virtue of a contract expressed or 
implied, and there are no allegations to that effect in the complaint. Nor one 
of forcible entry, since this action consists in depriving a person of the 
possession of a land or building for a period of time not exceeding one year, by 
force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, and the complaint does not 
contain such averments.</p>
<p>On the contrary, according to the above quoted allegations in the complaint, 
the illegal possession of the land in litigation by the defendants dates back to 
the year 1943, that is, about three years before the filing of the complaint. 
The complaint alleges that "In the latter part of the year 1943, after the 
plaintiff had bought the land in question, the defendants were notified by the 
plaintiff that they give or pay the corresponding share or rent of the land they 
were cultivating to the plaintiff herein as owner of said land, but the 
defendants not only refused and continue to refuse or give or pay the 
corresponding share or rent pertaining to the plaintiff herein as owner of the 
land, but also through threat and intimidation prevented the plaintiff or any of 
his representatives to take over the possession of that portion of the land in 
question". </p>
<p>The averment in the complaint that "on or about the month of November, 1945, 
just after the harvest, the defendants thru force and intimidation compelled the 
overseer of the plaintiff herein to allow them to take and receive 24 cavanes of 
palay from one of the plaintiff's tenants who is cultivating that part of that 
40 hectares of land they are occupying", is a premise for the recovery of said 
24 cavanes or the price thereof prayed for in the complaint. It is not a part of 
the allegation of facts constituting a cause of action of forcible entry, 
because it refers, not to ,the taking possessions of the land, but of the 24 
cavanes of palay from one of the tenants of the plaintiff who is cultivating a 
part of the forty (40) hectares of land they (the defendants) are occupying. 
</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is reversed, and the 
lower court is ordered to proceed with the trial of the case, with costs against 
the appellee. So ordered.</p><em>Parás, Actg., C.J., Perfecto, Bengzon,</em> 
and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
