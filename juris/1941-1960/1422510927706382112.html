				<H3>LEONARDO MONTES, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. THE CIVIL SERVICE BOARD OF APPEALS AND  THE  SECRETARY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner-appellant was on&nbsp; and before&nbsp; January,&nbsp; 1953, a&nbsp; watchman of the&nbsp; Floating Equipment Section, Ports and Harbors Division,&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Public Works.&nbsp; In&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; E-8182 instituted against him for negligence in the performance of duty (Dredge No. 6 under him had sunk because of water in the bilge, which he did not pump out&nbsp; while under his care), the&nbsp; Commissioner of Civil Service exonerated him,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; basis of findings made by a&nbsp; committee.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil Service&nbsp; Board&nbsp; of Appeals modified the decision, finding petitioner guilty of contributory negligence&nbsp; in&nbsp; not pumping the water&nbsp; from the bilge, and&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; that he&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; resigned effective his last day of duty with pay, without prejudice to reinstatement at the discretion of the appointing officer.<br><br>Petitioner filed an action in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila to review the decision, but the said court dis missed the action&nbsp; on a motion&nbsp; to dismiss, on the ground that&nbsp; petitioner had&nbsp; not exhausted&nbsp; all his administrative remedies before he instituted&nbsp; the action.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case Is now before us on&nbsp; appeal against the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of dismissal.<br><br>The law which was applied&nbsp; by the lower court is Section 2 of&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 598,&nbsp; which provides:<br><blockquote>"The Civil&nbsp; Service Board of&nbsp; Appeals shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; the power and authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; hear and decide all&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; cases brought before it on appeal,&nbsp; and&nbsp; its decisions in such&nbsp; cases shall be final, unless revised or modified by the President of the Philippines."</blockquote>It&nbsp; is urged on the appeal that there is no duty imposed on a&nbsp; party&nbsp; against whom&nbsp; a decision has been&nbsp; rendered by the Civil Service Board of Appeals&nbsp; to&nbsp; appeal to the President, and that the tendency of courts has been not to&nbsp; subject the decision of the&nbsp; President to judicial review. It&nbsp; is&nbsp; further&nbsp; argued that if&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Auditor General may be appealed to the courts, those of the&nbsp; Civil Service&nbsp; Board&nbsp; of Appeals need not be acted upon by the President also, before recourse&nbsp; may be had to the courts. It is also argued that if a case is appealed to the President, his action should be final and&nbsp; not reviewable by the courts because such a course of action&nbsp; would be derogatory&nbsp; to the high office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; President.<br><br>The objection to a judicial&nbsp; review of a Presidential act arises from&nbsp; a failure to&nbsp; recognize the&nbsp; most important principle in our system of government, i.e., the separation of powers into three&nbsp; co-equal departments, the executive, the&nbsp; legislative and&nbsp; the judicial, each&nbsp; supreme within&nbsp; its own&nbsp; assigned powers and&nbsp; duties.&nbsp; When a presidential act&nbsp; is challenged before the courts of&nbsp; justice, it is not to be implied therefrom that the Executive is being made subject and subordinate to the&nbsp; courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; legality&nbsp; of his acts are under&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; review, not&nbsp; because the&nbsp; Executive is inferior to&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts, but&nbsp; because&nbsp; the law is above the Chief Executive&nbsp; himself, and the courts&nbsp; seek only&nbsp; to&nbsp; interpret,&nbsp; apply&nbsp; or implement it (the law).&nbsp; A judicial review of the President's decision on a case of&nbsp; an employee decided&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Civil&nbsp; Service Board of&nbsp; Appeals should be viewed in this light and the bringing of&nbsp; the case to the courts should be governed by the same principles as govern the judicial review&nbsp; of&nbsp; all administrative&nbsp; acts&nbsp; of all administrative officers.<br><br>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies requires that where an administrative&nbsp; remedy is provided by statute, as&nbsp; in this case,&nbsp; relief&nbsp; must be sought by exhausting this remedy before the courts will act.&nbsp;&nbsp; (42&nbsp; Am. Jur. 580-581.)&nbsp; The&nbsp; doctrine is&nbsp; a device based&nbsp; on&nbsp; considerations of&nbsp; comity and&nbsp; convenience.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; a&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; is still&nbsp; available within&nbsp; the&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; machinery,&nbsp; this should be&nbsp; resorted to before resort can&nbsp; be&nbsp; made to the courts,&nbsp; not only to&nbsp; give&nbsp; the administrative agency opportunity to decide the matter by itself correctly, but also to prevent unnecessary and premature resort to the courts. (<i>Ibid.</i>)<br><br>Section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 598&nbsp; above-quoted is a clear expression of the policy or principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the President, under whom the Civil Service directly falls in our administrative system as head of the executive department, may be able to grant the remedy that petitioner pursues, reasons of comity and orderly procedure demand that resort be made&nbsp; to&nbsp; him before recourse can be had to the courts.&nbsp; We have&nbsp; applied this same rule in De la Paz <i>vs.</i> Alcaraz, et al.,&nbsp; 99 Phil., 130,&nbsp; 52 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 3037, Miguel,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al. <i>vs.</i> Reyes, et al., 93 Phil., 542, and especially in Ang Tuan Kai &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. The Import&nbsp; Control&nbsp; Commission,&nbsp; 91&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 143, and&nbsp; we are loathe to deviate from the rule we have consistently followed,&nbsp; especially in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the express provision of the law (section 2, Commonwealth Act No. 598).<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp;&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angela, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,&nbsp; Endencia,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
