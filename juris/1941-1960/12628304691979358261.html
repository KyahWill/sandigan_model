				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appellants&nbsp; were charged with murder before&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Manila and&nbsp; were sentenced each to suffer the extreme penalty of death, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P6,000, and&nbsp; to pay the costs. By&nbsp; operation of law,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; was brought&nbsp; before this Court for review.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the morning of&nbsp; April 29,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; at&nbsp; about&nbsp; 2 o'clock, while&nbsp; Ernesto Basa&nbsp; was sleeping in&nbsp; a&nbsp; pushcart&nbsp; placed along the sidewalk of Sto.&nbsp; Cristo Street near the southeast corner of&nbsp; that street&nbsp; and&nbsp; Azcarraga,&nbsp; Manila, and Ernesto&nbsp; Balaktaw&nbsp; was also sleeping&nbsp; on a&nbsp; box situated near the pushcart,&nbsp; with their heads opposite each other, Balaktaw was awakened when someone kicked&nbsp; his&nbsp; hand. Upon awakening,&nbsp; Balaktaw&nbsp; saw&nbsp; Sofronio Palin proceed toward the head of Ernesto&nbsp; Basa and&nbsp; hold the latter by the shoulder&nbsp; at which&nbsp; moment&nbsp; his&nbsp; companion&nbsp; Geronimo, Soliman approached Ernesto&nbsp; Basa and&nbsp; stabbed him&nbsp; many times with&nbsp; a&nbsp; <i>balisong</i>.&nbsp; Thereafter, the&nbsp; assailants ran away. <br><br>Balaktaw&nbsp; took Basa&nbsp; to a calesa and proceeded&nbsp; to a police outpost&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; corner of&nbsp; Azcarraga&nbsp; and Elcano Streets and reported the incident to Patrolman Tolentino. The patrolman&nbsp; boarded&nbsp; the <i>calesa</i> and&nbsp; directed the driver to proceed to Mary Johnston Hospital.&nbsp; From there, the three transferred to an ambulance and proceeded to the North General&nbsp; Hospital where Basa was treated, but he expired in the morning&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; day.&nbsp; At 4&nbsp; o'clock in the afternoon, Dr. Mariano Lara, Chief&nbsp; Medical Examiner of&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; Police Department, made an autopsy of the deceased&nbsp; and found that the&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; death&nbsp; is !as follows:&nbsp; "Profuse&nbsp; exsanguinating hemorrhage (only 850 cc. recovered) and shock due to multiple (7)&nbsp; stab wounds, two (2)&nbsp; being&nbsp; fatal, piercing the pyloric portion of the stomach,&nbsp; duodenum, jejunum,&nbsp; hepatic&nbsp; flexure&nbsp; of&nbsp; colon and right kidney."<br><br>Appellant Soliman testified that prior to the present incident,&nbsp; or&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; deceased tried to borrow his pushcart and, as he was not able to lend&nbsp; it to him, the deceased boxed him&nbsp; and as a consequence, he suffered physical injuries;&nbsp; that that incident was settled amicably on the same day by the companions of the deceased ; that&nbsp; on another&nbsp; occasion the&nbsp; deceased beat&nbsp; up Soliman with an iron pipe and the latter had to undergo medical&nbsp; treatment;&nbsp; that in the&nbsp; night of April&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1955, after he had eaten in Folgueras St., he proceeded to a&nbsp; truck of the United Bus Line of&nbsp; which&nbsp; he was a watchman; that&nbsp; while&nbsp; he was passing Sto. Cristo&nbsp; Street,&nbsp; the deceased called him and asked for a drink; that he told the deceased he&nbsp; had no&nbsp; money,&nbsp; but the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; forced&nbsp; him to give him money&nbsp; and even boxed him; that because the deceased had three companions, he pulled&nbsp; out his knife&nbsp; and upon seeing this,&nbsp; the three&nbsp; companions ran away; that&nbsp; he and the deceased fought&nbsp; in the course of which he stabbed him; that while&nbsp; they&nbsp; were fighting, one&nbsp; Sofronio Palin&nbsp; came and separated them; and that when they were&nbsp; separated Palin advised him to surrender to the police, so he went home and asked his brothers to accompany him to the Meisic Station. <br><br>Appellant Palin merely corroborated&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony of his co-accused by declaring that while he was eating at a restaurant&nbsp; at the corner of Sto.&nbsp; Cristo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Azcarraga Streets in the&nbsp; morning in&nbsp; question, he saw Soliman and the deceased&nbsp; grappling&nbsp; with&nbsp; each other;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he tried to separate them and succeeded in doing so; that&nbsp; after the two&nbsp; were separated, he&nbsp; asked Soliman&nbsp; to surrender and the latter heeded his&nbsp; advice. The&nbsp; two&nbsp; appellants are charged with&nbsp; a very&nbsp; serious crime&nbsp; as in&nbsp; fact they&nbsp; were&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; the extreme penalty of death.&nbsp; It is therefore important that we scrutinize carefully the&nbsp; evidence on which&nbsp; the&nbsp; conviction is made to depend.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this case, we&nbsp; notice that the conviction&nbsp; is mainly predicated&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of one eyewitness&nbsp; supported&nbsp; by some circumstantial&nbsp; evidence. This witness is Ernesto Balaktaw.&nbsp; Whether this witness has told the&nbsp; truth or not in narrating the aggression which led to&nbsp; the death of the&nbsp; victim, much depends&nbsp; upon the degree of his credibility.&nbsp; As&nbsp; usual, this is the function of the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court.&nbsp; Because&nbsp; of its opportunity to observe the conduct, demeanor and&nbsp; manner of&nbsp; testifying of the witness,&nbsp; the trial court&nbsp; is in a&nbsp; better position to pass upon and gauge their credibility. <br><br>In this respect, we notice&nbsp; that the trial court has been most careful in taking notice not&nbsp; only&nbsp; of the conduct of the&nbsp; witness during&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; but of&nbsp; other&nbsp; extraneous matters that may help&nbsp; in reaching a&nbsp; correct conclusion. The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; found the testimony&nbsp; of Balaktaw worthy&nbsp; of credence not only because it is in&nbsp; part&nbsp; corroborated by the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; Soliman&nbsp; himself&nbsp; who&nbsp; admitted having inflicted&nbsp; the wounds that&nbsp; caused&nbsp; the death of the victim, (although by way of self-defense) but also because it is&nbsp; supported by the nature of&nbsp; the wounds as found&nbsp; by Dr.&nbsp; Lara in his autopsy.&nbsp; Thus, in&nbsp; brushing aside&nbsp; the defense of appellant Soliman because the same runs counter to the nature and character&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; wounds inflicted&nbsp; on the&nbsp; deceased, the court&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; contention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defense that the&nbsp; wounds&nbsp; were&nbsp; inflicted while the deceased Ernesto 'Rasa was struggling or grappling with Geronimo is belied by the testimony of the&nbsp; medical examiner and by the&nbsp; nature and character of the wounds&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; body&nbsp; of the deceased, as may be seen in&nbsp; Exhibits&nbsp; D, D-1,&nbsp; D-2 and D-3.&nbsp; An examination of the pictures&nbsp; of the deceased as appears in Exhibits D-1&nbsp; and D-2,&nbsp; especially the wound that&nbsp; appears a little&nbsp; above the duodenum, shows clearly that&nbsp; the&nbsp; wounds were inflicted when the deceased was&nbsp; in a lying&nbsp; position as testified to by the witness for the&nbsp; prosecution, Ernesto Balaklaw.&nbsp; The wounds&nbsp; that&nbsp; may&nbsp; be seen&nbsp; under the left armpit&nbsp; of the deceased could&nbsp; not have&nbsp; been possibly inflicted&nbsp; if the deceased was in a standing position.&nbsp;&nbsp; This wound under&nbsp; the left armpit is the result&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; stab when the deceased was&nbsp; in&nbsp; a lying position with&nbsp; his hand extended upwards in self-defense." </blockquote>On&nbsp; the other&nbsp; hand, the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; made also careful observation&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; and&nbsp; demeanor of&nbsp; the&nbsp; two accused during&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; and in this&nbsp; respect, made the following observation: <br><blockquote>"During the course&nbsp; of the hearing,&nbsp; in order to&nbsp; give every iota of evidence its proper probatory value, the Court had paid special attention to&nbsp; the&nbsp; manner in which the accused and&nbsp;&nbsp; he witnesses testified, as well as their general appearance.&nbsp; The accused Soliman is&nbsp; a&nbsp; well-built man,&nbsp; robust&nbsp; and&nbsp; apparently&nbsp; strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; accused Palm&nbsp; is a&nbsp; little bigger than the&nbsp; other&nbsp; accused&nbsp; and of stranger physique.&nbsp; The deceased, as&nbsp; it appears&nbsp; from&nbsp; the pictures, while&nbsp; he may be slightly higher in .stature than the accused Soliman, has a thinner&nbsp; constitution and&nbsp; much&nbsp; smaller&nbsp; than the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; Palm.&nbsp; Judging these&nbsp; two&nbsp; accused&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; manner they testified in court, their apparent indifference to all&nbsp; the court&nbsp; proceedings in spite of the seriousness&nbsp; of tire crime&nbsp; charged against&nbsp; them, and the manner&nbsp; of testifying in&nbsp; short, curt and&nbsp; confused manner, convinced this&nbsp; Court that they gave little importance to the case against them and&nbsp; to the proceeding in court." </blockquote>The&nbsp; defense,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; claims&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony of Ernesto Balaktaw should&nbsp; not be&nbsp; given credit because it is self-contradictory and inconsistent with the testimony of Pat. Tolentino and Det. Senen.&nbsp;&nbsp; But,&nbsp; aside&nbsp; from the fact that the alleged&nbsp; contradictions refer to unimportant details&nbsp; or circumstances,&nbsp; they&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; explained&nbsp; and reconciled.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was&nbsp; done&nbsp; by the Solicitor General in his brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; After going&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp; explanation and reconciliation made by this official, we are satisfied that the alleged contradictions or inconsistencies cannot destroy the credibility of the&nbsp; witness. <br><br>An important flaw pointed out by&nbsp; the defense&nbsp; refers to the&nbsp; manner&nbsp; the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; identified&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; defendants. It is claimed&nbsp; that when this witness was made to identify accused Soliman he pointed to accused Palin and&nbsp; when he was asked to&nbsp; identify&nbsp; the latter, he pointed to the former. And he also committed a mistake in&nbsp; designating &nbsp; the nick&nbsp; names of the two accused.<br><br>While it is true&nbsp; that&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; start&nbsp; of his testimony this witness&nbsp; was. confused in identifying&nbsp; the accused&nbsp; by their names,&nbsp; however, when&nbsp; he was asked&nbsp; by the&nbsp; court immediately thereafter to&nbsp; put his hands on each&nbsp; of them, he was able&nbsp; to&nbsp; identify them correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court&nbsp; then made the following observation: <br><blockquote>"Witness identified both accused-&nbsp; At the time when&nbsp; he pointed to the accused&nbsp; he apparently&nbsp; made&nbsp; a mistake may&nbsp; be due to the fact that the accused were both seated together and when he pointed to the accused&nbsp; he might have&nbsp; been out of his sense&nbsp; of&nbsp; direction." (pp. 2-3, t.s.n.,&nbsp; Lloren.) </blockquote>The defense also claims that the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred in not granting its motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence which consists&nbsp; of the&nbsp; criminal record of prosecution&nbsp; witness Ernesto&nbsp; Balaktaw.&nbsp; This&nbsp; claim is&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; In the first place,&nbsp; the criminal&nbsp; record of Balaktaw&nbsp; cannot be considered as newly&nbsp; discovered&nbsp; evidence because the same was available to the defense much prior to the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; case.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears&nbsp; that said record can be obtained from the Criminal&nbsp; Identification Section of the Manila&nbsp; Police&nbsp; Department for,&nbsp; with the exception&nbsp; of&nbsp; one conviction&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; on September 1, 1955, all the&nbsp; other convictions and&nbsp; charges date as far back as January 19, 1955, months prior&nbsp; to the trial&nbsp; of the instant case.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; second&nbsp; place, the fact that a person has been previously convicted of a crime&nbsp; does not&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; disqualify him&nbsp; as a witness for he&nbsp; may still prove to&nbsp; be a truthful one.<br><br>The claim that the trial court also erred in not allowing the defense to&nbsp; prove that the deceased&nbsp; had&nbsp; a violent, quarrelsome or provocative character&nbsp; cannot also deserve consideration.&nbsp; While good or bad moral character may be availed of&nbsp; as an aid to determine the probability or improbability&nbsp; of the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; an offense&nbsp; (Section 15, Rule 123), such is not necessary in a crime of murder where&nbsp; the killing is committed through&nbsp; treachery or premeditation.&nbsp; The proof of such character may&nbsp; only be allowed in&nbsp; homicide cases&nbsp; to show "that it has&nbsp; produced a reasonable&nbsp; belief of&nbsp; imminent danger in&nbsp; the mind of the accused and a justifiable&nbsp; conviction&nbsp; that a .prompt defensive&nbsp; action was&nbsp; necessary."&nbsp; (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1952&nbsp; ed.,&nbsp; Vol. 3, p. 126.&nbsp; This rule does&nbsp; not apply to cases of murder. <br><br>While the Court&nbsp; is of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that&nbsp; the evidence is a sufficient to convict both appellants of the crime charged, some members however expressed doubt as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the propriety&nbsp; of imposing&nbsp; the&nbsp; extreme penalty and&nbsp; so, for lack of&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary number of votes,&nbsp; the Court has resolved to&nbsp; impose upon,&nbsp; them the&nbsp; penalty of&nbsp; <i>reclusion&nbsp; perpetua</i>. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; modified in the sense of imposing upon&nbsp; appellants merely the penalty of&nbsp; <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,&nbsp; affirming the decisions&nbsp; in&nbsp; all other respects, with costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
