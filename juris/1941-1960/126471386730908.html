				<H3>CEBU ARRASTRE SERVICE, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT,  VS. COLLECTOR  OF INTERNAL REVENUE,  RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is  an appeal  from the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals affirming  the decision  of the Collector  of Internal Revenue  (later  referred to as collector), denying  exemption to the  petitioner-appellant Cebu  Arrastre Service  (later referred  to  as cebu arrastre)  from the percentage tax under section  191 of the National Internal Revenue Code, and for refund of the amount of F2,867.02 already  paid.</p>
<p>In 1952 the Cebu Arrastre, an  association  of persons engaged in the handling of cargoes carried by coastwise vessels  stopping at  the  port of Cebu,  thru its counsel Atty.  Jose  Muana  petitioned  the  Collector  of Internal Revenue for the exemption and the refund based  on the following  grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(1) That they werp a  group of laborers who had  recently organized themselves  into an arrastre service association  merely for the purpose of centralizing the collection of handling" charges and  making direct payment to the men in  order to insure  the compliance  of the Minimum  Wage Law requirement.</p>
  <p>"(2) That the work  of the men of the said arrastre group is under the direct supervision  and control of the officers of the ships.</p>
  <p>"(3) That the Cebu  Arrastre Service is engaged solely in  the loading and unloading  of cargoes to and from the boats  and is not engaged in the  transportation business."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acting upon the petition, the  Collector referred the matter to  his  agent  in  Cebu   for  investigation.   Mr.  Ignacio Quijano, the Assistant Agent, conducted the investigation and filed  his report, the pertinent  portions of which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"1. The loading and  unloading of cargoes to and from the ship's holds is  done  by the  laborers  under the 'Cebu  Arrastre  Service Co.,  Inc.'</p>
  <p>"2. The supervision of the ship's officers in the work is confined only to the proper handling of  the cargoes according to their nature and to the proper placing of the cargoes inside the ship's holds.</p>
  <p>"3. As to the laborers' actuations outside of the handling and placing of  cargoes inside  the ship's  holds the officers of the ship have no  supervision. </p>

<p align="center">*           *           *           *           *           * </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"6. The 'Cebu Arrastre  Service  Co., Inc.'  is not engaged in the transportation of the cargoes from the wharf to the bodegas of the  shippers. The  shippers  have their own trucks or provide for the transportation of their cargoes from  the wharf to their bodegas.</p>
  <p>"7. The laborers  of  the  'Cebu Arrastre  Service  Co.,  Inc.'  help only in the loading of  the cargoes from the wharf to the shippers' trucks,  for  the shippers'  trucks  are  provided with their  own 'journales'."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the  basis of said  report the Collector  denied  the petition, holding that inasmuch as the Cebu Arrastre was engaged in the loading and unloading of vessels  in port, it may be considered a stevedore  within the meaning of section 191 of the Tax  Code.  In  this connection, it may be  stated  that section  191 of the Tax Code  imposes a tax equivalent to  3  per  cent of the gross  receipts  on certain  businesses  and business  entities,  among them stevedores.</p>
<p>In  his brief  counsel for petitioner-appellant  bitterly assails  the proceedings had in this  case, saying that it "has been most  inquisitorial,  reminiscent of  the ancient and antiquated method  of administering justice by which the defendant was condemned without benefit of confrontation.   The guarantee and protection  jealousy safeguarded by our Constitution has been completely disregarded.   The report of  the BIR  Agent  was a mere unilateral  affair and its  findings  were arrived  at  without the petitioner-appellants'  having  had the slightest  opportunity to  be confronted  and his side heard."   We have examined the record of the proceedings and  find this  attack  unfounded. Although the Board of Tax Appeals as an appellate board usually considers only the  evidence  that comes  with the appeal, nevertheless, in this case a hearing was had before it,  and the very same counsel  Atty.  Jose Muana testified on behalf  of the Cebu  Arrastre,  his client and of which he was the president, but he failed to present any evidence or give any testimony in support of his present contention that the Cebu Arrastre is not engaged  in  the  work of loading cargoes into the holds  of the  boat or unloading the  same  from it.   But in  his memorandum  filed  with the Tax Board,  he made statements which the Tax Board liberally considered as evidence but which the Board regarded as insufficient  and  not  entirely credible.   We reproduce a portion of  the decision  of the  Tax Board  on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In  its memorandum filed with  us in  Support of its  petition for review of the case, petitioner's counsel makes some  additional statements of facts wherein he avers that, 'Their work  (that of the company's laborers)  was  simply the handling of cargoes at the wharf  almost mechanically  under the control  and supervision of the shipping companies.  In cases  where  boats had booms  their work  was  simply  to load on the wharf  at the  ships  tackle  by placing the cargoes in the  sling  and hooking  unto the tackle, and unloading  by unhooking the sling from the  tackle and discharging the cargoes on the wharf.   In rare  cases where the boats have no booms, these men carry the cargoes up to  the deck for the stevedores on board to store  in the hold, in  the case of  loading, and carry cargoes from the  deck which  have been unloaded from the hold by the stevedores to the wharf.'</p>
  <p>"We have here three descriptions of the kind of work performed by the  laborers of petitioner corporation, of which  one  is widely different from the other two: one is from the investigator of the Bureau of Internal Revenue who says that  the laborers in  question  carry cargoes to and  from the  pier to  the hold  of  ships, which agrees with  the description appearing on the original request to the  Collector by the President and Counselor of the Corporation, the other being the contention of the same official of the Arrastre Service who, in his memorandum on appeal, would have  us believe that  its  workingmen merely  place the cargoes in the slings and then leave  the ships tackle to  lift  and drop them into  the  holds or dump them on  decks,  there to  be stowed  by another set of workingmen,  presumably not connected at all with  the Arrastre Service Corporation.  When  ships are not provided with booms, cargoes are carried by  the  Arrastre Service laborers  over planks or ladders  to be  dumped  into  the  deck  or  into  the hold,  there to be  stowed by  another set  of stevedores not related  to the Corporation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">*        * *       *        *        *</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The question, then revolves  around the facts and around the credibility of  the  description depicting the  exact nature  of the work of the laborers  working  under  the contracts  entered  into by  the  Cebu Arrastre Co.  Inc. with Cebu shipowners.  We  just determine therefore,  which  of  the two  conflicting  versions conies nearer the reality of the situation.</p>
  <p>"We may  say at the outset  that  the preponderance of evidence is in favor of the version of the Assistant Agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue  of Cebu.  According to  him the loading and unloading  of cargoes to  and  from  the ships holds is  done by the  laborers under  the Cebu Arrastre  Service Co., Inc.  and the ships officers supervision  is limited  to  the proper  placing  of the same inside  the  ships hold, the inference  being that said 'proper placing (stowing)  is being done by  the  corporation laborers.  This is not contradicted by the  version  of  the petitioner as  given  in its  original petition wherein  it says: The  men working under the Cebu Arrastre Service are same men  of  'Katubusanan sa Maraumuo' who have been  handling the loading of the  boats  of  the Aboitiz &amp; Co. and of the Philippine Navigation Co. since 1947 up  to the present.'   It  says also, further on: 'The Cebu Arrastre Service is dedicated  itself  solely  to the  loading  and  unloading  of  cargoes on the boats .  . .'  It is  true that the  President and Counsel corrected this  description  in  the memorandum on  appeal  to  the effect that  laborers  of the  corporation do  not,  except  on  rare occasions,  engage in loading or unloading  the  boat  but  limit their work on loading or  unloading pele-mele. the  slings of the boats under contract  with  the Arrastre Service, but in  the  opinion  of the  Board  this  amendment  is  not nearer to  the  truth than  the original version  which was  corroborated  by the official  who investigated the case by order of the  Collector of  Internal  Revenue.</p>
  <p>"It is  noteworthy  that in the  agreement  entered  into by  the shipowners  and  the  corporation  mention  is  twice  made of  the 'arrastre service on the  vessels'  (but  never on the piers) to be done  by the  laborers of  the Cebu Arrastre  Service  Inc.  Another circumstance which may  help in  obtaining a clear  picture  of  the situation is that nowhere  in  these papers  is it contended  that the stevedores  actually  performing  the   stowing  work  belong  to an organization not related to the petitioner."</p>
  <p>We quote the  following definitions  of stevedores, viz:<br>
    <br>
    Stevedores is  "one who  works at,  or  one who is responsible for, the unloading and  loading of a  vessel  in  port.  (Webster's New International Dictionary, Second Edition  (unabridged), p. 2473).</p>
  <p>A stevedore  is a person  employed in loading  and unloading a vessel.  (The Owego, D. C. Wash., 292  F.  505, 507).</p>
  <p>Stevedores  are  class of laborers at  the  ports whose business it is to load  and unload vessels.  (The Senator, 21 F. 191).</p>
  <p>"Stevedore" is defined as "one whose occupation is to load and unload vessels in port"; in other words, a contractor or a jobber for  special  business  ready  to  be  employed by  anybody  at  his line  of work (Rankin <em>vs.</em>  Merchants  and Miners  Transp. Co., 73 Ga.  239, 54 Am. Rep. 874).</p>
  <p>"Stevedore" and "longshoreman", are  synonymous terms when interpreted in the light of the work they perform, namely loading and unloading of vessels  (Zampiere <em>vs.</em>  Willian  Spencer and Son Corporation, 185 N.Y.S. 639, 640, 194 App. Div. 576).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the above definitions the Cebu Arrastre admittedly engaged  in the work of loading and unloading coast wise vessels calling at the port of Cebu, should be  regarded as a stevedore and therefore subject to the percentage tax under section 191  of the  Tax Code.  But  even  if  we applied the narrower and more  specific concept of stevedore used by  the Tax Board, namely, that a stevedore is one who places cargoes  in the holds of ships  in  such a way that the boat would maintain an even keel, and that even with the movement of the boat, especially in rough weather, the  cargoes would  not be  displaced from their  original position, still', under the finding  of  fact made by  the Tax Board that  the  Cebu Arrastre is  engaged in  this  work of towing cargo either in the hold  or even on the  deck, appellant would be subject to the tax.   We also agree with the Tax Board that the purpose  for which the petitioner-appellant  was  organized,   and  the   supervision exercised by the ships' officers over its work in loading and unloading vessels including  the towing of cargo, has nothing  to  do  with  the  tax  liability  of  the petitioner-appellant.</p>
<p>In view  of the foregoing, the decision appealed  from is hereby affirmed, with  costs in  both instances.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon,  Padilla, Reyes,  A.,  Bautista Angelo,  Labrador,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.  L., </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
