				<H3>DESTILERIA AYALA Y CIA., INC., PETITIONER, VS. LIGA NACIONAL OBRERA DE FILIPINAS AND THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for certiorari filed in 1941 to review an 
order of the Curt of Industrial Relations. The record having been destroyed 
during the war, the case is not before us on a reconstituted record.
<p align="justify">It appears that under date of December 11, 1940, Detileria 
Ayala y Compa√±ia, Inc., petitioned the Court of Industrial Relations for 
authority to dismiss its bill-collector, Antonio Valdez, and its cashier, 
Francisco Serrano, the first for embezzlement and the second for alleged 
negligence in connection with said embezzlement. At the time, there was pending 
before that Court a dispute between the company and its employees concerning 
wages, and one of the employees affected by the dispute was the said Francisco 
Serrano for whom it was requested that his monthly salary, which was reduced in 
1934, be restored to its former level. The employees were then represented by 
the labor union to which they were affiliated, the "Liga Nacional Obrera de 
Filipinas", one of the present respondents.</p>
<p align="justify">After due hearing, the Industrial Court found Francisco Serrano 
to be "absolutely free from blame" and innocent of the charges imputed to him 
and, attributing his proposed dismissal to the company's desire to get rid of 
him because of his union activities in connection with the movement for increase 
of salaries in the company, denied the petition for authority to dismiss him. It 
is this decision, as contained in the order of the Court of March 13, 1941, that 
we are asked to review.</p>
<p align="justify">It would be idle for us to review the findings of fact of the 
Industrial Court. This we are not supposed to do both under the Rules of Court 
and the law creating that body. It would likewise be useless to discuss the 
petitioner's claim that the Industrial Court erred "when it held that the 
dismissal of Francisco Serrano would be a violation of Section 19 of Act 143 and 
section 5 of Act 213." It does not appear from the order complained of that the 
Industrial Court has so held. The only question for determination is whether, 
with his innocence completely established, Francisco Serrano could still be 
dismissed by his employer on the ground that the latter had already lost 
confidence in him.</p>
<p align="justify">It is contended that in a case where the relation between 
employer and employee is essentially one of trust, such as that existing between 
herein petitioner and its Cashier, the employer is not bound to retain the 
employee after the former has lost confidence in the latter. And it is further 
urged that for the employer to have the right to dismiss such an employee, it is 
not necessary that the employer should have suffered injury from the employee's 
misconduct, it being sufficient that such misconduct might reasonably lead to 
the employer's injury. The argument thus assumes that the cashier in the present 
case has been guilty of misconduct. The assumption, however, is contrary to the 
express finding of the Industrial Court that this employee had not been in any 
way negligent and was entirely free from blame in connection with the 
embezzlement committed by the bill-collector. This conclusion is one of fact, 
and there being evidence to support it, the same cannot be altered by this 
Court.</p>
<p align="justify">Our attention has been directed to the case of Miller vs. Jones 
(178 Iowa, 168) where it was declared that if the employee's "conduct was such 
as to indicate that his interests were hostile to those of his master, it was 
the right of the master to discharge him before any injury was in fact done." 
But it is obvious from this quotation that to give the employer the right to 
discharge his employee before actual injury has been caused, the employee's 
conduct should indicate that his interests are hostile to those of his employer. 
Such, however, is not the case here. Mere suspicion or simple apprehension of 
danger or prejudice is insufficient to justify removal of the employee (39 C. 
J., pp. 80-81), and to dismiss an innocent employee, such as the cashier in the 
present case, who, as found by the Industrial Court, has an untarnished record 
in the company for many years, just because he has identified himself with the 
movement to obtain concessions from the company in the matter of salaries, is to 
discourage legitimate union activities and frustrate the purpose of our labor 
laws.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition for review is, therefore, dismissed and the order 
appealed from is affirmed with costs against the appellant. So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Perfecto, Bengzon, 
Padilla, Tuason,</i> and <i>Montemayor, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
