				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DIONISIO  FELICIANO, DEFENDANT AND  APPELLANT.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by the defendant,&nbsp; Dionisio Feliciano, from the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of Cagayan, finding&nbsp; him guilty&nbsp; of illegal possession of&nbsp; a firearm and&nbsp; ammunition and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for&nbsp; an&nbsp; indeterminate period of not less than one year and one day and not more than three years, with costs, the&nbsp; firearm and&nbsp; ammunition being declared&nbsp; confiscated in favor of the Government.<br><br>In the early morning&nbsp; of&nbsp; June 10, 1950, Constabulary Sergeant Roman Arao conducted a search in&nbsp; the house of Francisco&nbsp; Mamba located in the <i>poblacion</i> of&nbsp; Tuao, Cagayan, in the course&nbsp; of which he found under the pillow of the&nbsp; appellant a revolver, caliber .45, with three rounds of ammunition.&nbsp; It is not necessary to&nbsp; take up&nbsp; appellant's argument that there is absolutely no proof that he had no permit&nbsp; or&nbsp; license to possess the articles&nbsp; in&nbsp; question, because the other contention that the appellant is not liable in view of Republic Act No. 482, is correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Act, in section&nbsp; 1, provides that an unlicensed holder or possessor of any firearm&nbsp; or ammunition may, without incurring criminal liability, surrender the same within&nbsp; the period of one year from the date the Act took effect&nbsp; (June 10, 1950), but that such unlicensed holder or possessor is not exempted if found within said period making use of the firearm and ammunition&nbsp; or carrying&nbsp; them&nbsp; on&nbsp; his person except for purposes of&nbsp; surrender.&nbsp; The statute, in&nbsp; effect legalizing mere unlicensed&nbsp; possession for a limited period,&nbsp; punishes only&nbsp; (1) using a firearm or ammunition or&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; carrying the&nbsp; same&nbsp; on the&nbsp; person except to&nbsp; give them&nbsp; up.&nbsp; The appellant was not charged with any of these two acts.<br><br>Wherefore, and following the recommendation&nbsp; of the Solicitor General, the&nbsp; appealed judgment is&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; and the defendant-appellant acquitted with costs <i>de officio</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Feria, Pablo,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angela</i> and<i> Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
