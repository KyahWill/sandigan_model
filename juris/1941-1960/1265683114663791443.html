				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. DOMINGO MOBE (ALIAS DOMING) ET AL., DEFENDANTS. DOMINGO MOBE (ALIAS DOMING), APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by Domingo Mobe from a sentence of "imprisonment for life" 
for murder. The appellant was also sentenced to pay the heirs of the deceased 
P2,000. as indemnity, jointly and severally with Leonardo Camoro, and the costs. 
With the appellant, Camoro was prosecuted for the same crime but was found 
guilty only as an accomplice and given a lesser penalty. He did not appeal.
<p>Wenceslao Robles, a policeman, testified that on the night of June 10, at 
about 12 o'clock, he and Catalino Tibon, another policeman, heard reports of 
firearms. As it was raining hard they did not move from where they sought 
shelter from the rain. At about 2 o'clock, when the rain had subsided, someone 
told them that there was a wounded man behind the drug store of Dr. Alonso 
crying for help. They rushed to that place and found Emilio Deiparine dead and 
Juan Saldo lying on the ground and groaning in a small alley behind the said 
drug store. When they asked Juan Saldo, after the latter bad given his name, 
what was the matter, Saldo said he was wounded. Saldo went oh to say that he and 
four others had intended to rob the drug store; that when he saw the watchman 
(Deiparine) with a carbine he grasped him to wrest his gun; that Domingo Mobe 
then shot the watchman hitting him in the abdomen. (Saldo was wounded by another 
shot unintentionally and died three days later in a hospital.) </p>
<p>Simplicio Samson testified that in June 1946 he was a member of the secret 
service of Cebu City. At about 1:00 o'clock a. m. of June 11, while on patrol 
duty with four other detectives, and after investigating another shooting, he 
met Robles and Tibon who told him and his companions that there was a wounded 
man on T. Padilla street. When they reached that place, Juan Saldo was already 
inside the store of Dr. Alonso and the watchman lay dead behind the store. At 
about 2:40 or 3 o'clock, he questioned Saldo because he was willing to make an 
ante-mortem confession, Saldo's condition was then very serious. Saldo related 
that his companions were Domingo Mobe, Camoro, Tantoy and longing. When he asked 
Saldo were his companions were he said they could be found in the house of 
Candido Caliso and Crispin, which was 700 or 800 meters away. Proceeding to the 
house indicated, Samson and his fellow officers saw Domingo Mobe in the act of 
jumping from the rear window of the house, with his feet muddy, and arrested 
him. Samson asked Mobe the whereabouts of his companions and Mobe pointed the 
place where they might find Leonardo Camoro. They caught the latter defendant at 
the corner of P. del Rosario and D. Pedro Cui streets spattered with mud and 
gasping.</p>
<p>When, after Domingo Mobe and Leonardo Camoro were arrested, they questioned 
them,the two defendants said that Domingo Mobe and Longing, (who was still at 
large at the time of the trial), were the ones who had killed the watchman. </p>
<p>Camoro made a written statement which he later subscribed and swore before 
the municipal judge. He declared that he was taken along by his four companions 
to rob a house on T. Padilla street; that Longing, Owat and Doming carried a 
pistol each and Tantoy a hunting knife; that he (Camoro) was unarmed; that upon 
arrival at the house which they were to rob they were spied by the watchman who 
followed them; that they took cover and forthwith Owat (Juan Saldo) grasped 
Deiparine; that Longing and Mobe opened fire wounding Owat as well as the 
watchman; that frightened he fled to the house of Crispin where he lived.</p>
<p>The appellant's evidence consists of a brief testimony of his own. He said he 
was asleep in the house of , Crispin at the time the killing was said to have 
occurred, having gone to bed at about 9 o'clock. He denied he knew Leonardo 
Camoro before they were thrown together in the city jail. He said he did not 
know why he was arrested. "I was just sleeping and they just asked my name", he 
said. He also denied he admitted to the police that he had a gun and hid it 
among banana trees at Calle Jonquera, as one of the witnesses for the 
prosecution testified.</p>
<p>The parties have discussed with commendable ability and earnestness of the 
admissibility and competence against the appellant of Saldo's and Camoro's 
declarations. There is no need, however, on our part to decide the nice points 
of law and fact so ably argued. For outside of the controversial confessions 
there is enough evidence to satisfy us beyond rational doubt that the appellant 
was one of the authors of the crime. </p>
<p>It has heretofore been seen that when the police authorities closed in upon 
the house indicated by Saldo at the wee hours of the morning, Mobe made an 
attempt to flee, his feet still covered with mud. It was through his indication 
that Camoro, who is now serving his sentence, was apprehended at an unusual hour 
and where he had no legitimate business to be. The two defendants lived or had 
been staying in the same house. And after both were safely in the hands of the 
police they confessed their participation in the crime, although only Camoro's 
statement was reduced to writing. It has also been seen that by their admission 
Mobe and Longing fired the fatal shots. Mobe further admitted to the police that 
he had concealed his pistol or revolver, so he was accompanied by one of the 
detectives to the place he mentioned, although the arm was no longer there when 
Bacus and Mote arrived. Surely these details were no fabrication. </p>
<p>Charged with a capital offense, the accused made a perfunctuory denial of 
policeman Roble's and detective Samson's testimony. His evidence on his alibi is 
very weak end is likewise conspicuous for its brevity. He did not present any 
witness, which he could have done very easily if his defense were good, to 
corroborate his testimony that he went to bed early and was asleep until awaken 
by the police. His statement that he did not know Saldo and only knew Camoro 
after their arrest is manifestly false and only serves to bring into relief his 
disregard for truth. </p>
<p>The crime committed was properly held by the trial court to be murder. It is 
qualified by treachery. Even though at the inception of the aggression the 
deceased carried a carbine and was at liberty to defend himself against the 
possible attacks by the malefactors, it is a fact that at the time the fatal 
wounds were inflicted he was defenseless. His freedom of movement was being 
restrained by one of the culprits when the appellant and one of his other 
companions fired at the victim. (<em>See</em> U. S. <em>vs</em>. Baluyot, 40 
Phil., 385.) The fact that one of the accused held fast the deceased from behind 
and the other assaulted him while in this position constitutes a form of 
aggression tending to insure its execution without any risk to the aggressors 
arising from any defense which the deceased might make. In other words, this 
assault is treacherous as defined by this paragraph. (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Valdez, 
40 Phil., 876.)</p>
<p>The trial court appreciated the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity, that 
of the crime having been committed by a band of more than three armed people, 
and that "of (accused) taking advantage in employing means to weaken the 
defense." But in spite of these findings and the lack of any mitigating 
circumstances to upset the aggravating circumstanced said to have been proven, 
Mobe was sentenced only to "imprisonment for life". Yet the judgment is correct. 
We believe with the Solicitor General that the aggravating circumstance of band 
has not been clearly established, as only three of the malefactors have been 
shown positively to have been armed. As for nocturnity, this circumstance is 
embraced in treachery and can not be considered separately from the latter. (U. 
S. <em>vs</em>. Salgado, 11 Phil., 56; People <em>vs</em>. Bumanglag, 56 Phil., 
10; People <em>vs</em>. Madrid, G. R. No. 41976, Nov. 4, 1934.) Like nighttime, 
the circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength is inherent in, and 
comprehended by, the circumstance of treachery. When treachery is taken into 
account as a qualifying circumstance in murder, it is improper again to consider 
in addition to that circumstance the generic aggravating circumtance of abuse of 
superior strength, since the latter is necessarily included in the former. (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Estopia, 28 Phil., 97; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Oro, 19 Phil., 548, U. 
S. <em>vs</em>. Vitug, 17 Phil., 1.) </p>
<p>There being neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances present, the 
judgment of the court below is correct in its result, except that the 
"imprisonment for life" should be changed to <em>reclusíon perpetua</em>. It is 
best to employ the legal terminology in the imposition of a penalty for the 
different kinds of incarceration — <em>reclusíon prisión</em>, imprisonment, 
etc. — have their corresponding legal accessories and effects. </p>
<p>With this modification, the appealed decision is affirmed with costs of the 
appeal against the appellant. </p><em>Parás, Feria, Perfecto,</em> and 
<em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
