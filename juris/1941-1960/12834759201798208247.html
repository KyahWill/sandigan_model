				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp;&nbsp; of Cavite&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court&nbsp;&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp;&nbsp; which the&nbsp; latter court ins certified to us on tho ground that "all the questions&nbsp; raised by&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; purely of law.”<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; on July 1,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1910,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp;&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp;&nbsp; through tho Director of Lands,&nbsp;&nbsp; agreed to sell Lot No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1899 of the Santa Cruz de Malabon Estate&nbsp;&nbsp; (Friar lands)&nbsp;&nbsp; in Tanza,&nbsp;&nbsp; Cavite,&nbsp;&nbsp; to Prudencio Nepomuceno under the terms and conditions stipulated in sale certificate No. 1400,&nbsp; among&nbsp; them&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; price&nbsp; was&nbsp; to be&nbsp; paid&nbsp; in instalments,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that "this certificate,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the&nbsp;&nbsp; rights hereunder under conferred,&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be&nbsp;&nbsp; transferred&nbsp;&nbsp; only after&nbsp; the written&nbsp;&nbsp; consent&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Director of Lands&nbsp;&nbsp; thereto&nbsp;&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; been first had&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; obtained.&nbsp; Prudencio Nepomuceno died before Jig&nbsp; could pay all the installments,&nbsp; and his rights and&nbsp; title to&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp; lot&nbsp; were,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Director of Lands, ceded to&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased's only heir,. Marciana Nepomuceno,&nbsp;&nbsp; the cession being recorded in the Bureau of Lands&nbsp; on July 19,&nbsp; 1929.<br><br>On December 23, 1930, Marciana Nopomuceno and her husband Antonio Bobadilla&nbsp;&nbsp; obtained, a loan of P1,000&nbsp; from Quintin B. Dones, which.,&nbsp;&nbsp; in a notarial document signed by them on&nbsp; that day,&nbsp;&nbsp; they promised to pay in the&nbsp; month of April,&nbsp; 1936,&nbsp; with the&nbsp;&nbsp; stipulation that,&nbsp;&nbsp; in case&nbsp;&nbsp; of default,&nbsp; they would&nbsp; give&nbsp; in payment&nbsp;&nbsp; (ipinananagot naming&nbsp; ibayad)&nbsp; the. southern half&nbsp; of the lot&nbsp; above mentioned,&nbsp;&nbsp; it being&nbsp; further agreed that they would cede&nbsp; to Bones,&nbsp;&nbsp; free&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; charge,&nbsp;&nbsp; full possession and enjoyment of the said half from May,&nbsp; 1931,&nbsp; to April,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1937,&nbsp; give him in addition 15 cavans&nbsp;&nbsp; of palay after the 1931 harvest,&nbsp; and also continue 'paying&nbsp; the instalments due&nbsp; the Government on said lot. Apparently in&nbsp; conformity with this agreement,&nbsp; Dones in 1931&nbsp; occupied&nbsp; the southern half&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lot. But&nbsp; this&nbsp; he did without&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; approval of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director of Lands.<br><br>On November&nbsp; 22,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1932,&nbsp; Marciana Neporauceno died intestate,&nbsp;&nbsp; leaving&nbsp;&nbsp; as her heirs her husband Antonio Sobadilla and their children. She&nbsp; died without having? paid either the&nbsp; installments due&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands&nbsp; or the P1,000 borrowed by her and her husband from Danes, For delinquency in the payment&nbsp; of said instalments,&nbsp; the Government,&nbsp; on October 21,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1940, cancelled the certificate of&nbsp;&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in her favor, the cancellation&nbsp; carrying with it&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; forfeiture of all payments already made,&nbsp; which amounted&nbsp; to P1,193-41, and all improvements on&nbsp; the land.<br><br>But&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; land could be disposed of by the Government, Marclana's heirs,&nbsp;&nbsp; on January 15,&nbsp; 1944,&nbsp;&nbsp; that is,&nbsp;&nbsp; during the&nbsp;&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; occupation,&nbsp; applied for the&nbsp; reinstatement of the&nbsp;&nbsp; sales&nbsp; contract&nbsp; in her favor and two months later paid to&nbsp;&nbsp; the Bureau of&nbsp; Lands&nbsp; the balance&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; price.&nbsp; This&nbsp; was&nbsp; as author! zed in&nbsp; section&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp; of Executive&nbsp; Order No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 8,&nbsp;&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the Philippine Executive Commission,&nbsp; which reads:<br><blockquote>“SEC.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.- For the purpose&nbsp; hereof,&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any cancelled sales&nbsp; contract which&nbsp; covers a&nbsp; tract&nbsp; of land&nbsp;&nbsp; that has not&nbsp;&nbsp; yet been&nbsp; disposed&nbsp; of may be&nbsp; reinstated for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; issuing&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; conveyance&nbsp; therefor after&nbsp; the necessary revaluation has been made&nbsp; and&nbsp; upon payment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; purchase price&nbsp; thereof:&nbsp; Provided,&nbsp;&nbsp; That when&nbsp; an expired contract is modified and extended or when a contract&nbsp; that has&nbsp; already been&nbsp; cancelled is&nbsp;&nbsp; reinstated, the land&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyed&nbsp; shall not exceed ten&nbsp; (10) hectares,&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x”<br></blockquote>On February 27,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1944, Quint in B,&nbsp; Dones,&nbsp;&nbsp; on his part,&nbsp;&nbsp; filed with&nbsp;&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of Lands&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; own application for the&nbsp; purchase of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; some lot,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the Director of Lands,&nbsp;&nbsp; on January 31, 1950, approved&nbsp; the&nbsp; application&nbsp; and ordered the sale&nbsp; of the lot&nbsp; to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; a notion for reconsideration,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director of&nbsp; Lands,&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; an order anted June&nbsp; 12.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1950, which was approved by&nbsp; the Secretary&nbsp;&nbsp; of Agriculture&nbsp; and Natural Resources,&nbsp;&nbsp; set aside&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision in favor of Dones&nbsp; and&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; the right of Marclana's hairs&nbsp; to&nbsp; a final&nbsp; conveyance&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp; the Executive Order aforementioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; port&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; order says:<br><blockquote>"For all&nbsp; the foregoing&nbsp;&nbsp; consider at ions,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; order issued by this Office&nbsp;&nbsp; on January. 31, 1950?&nbsp;&nbsp; recognizing Quint in Dones as&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; actual and banafide&nbsp;&nbsp; occupant of Lot No.&nbsp; 1899&nbsp; Is&nbsp; hereby set&nbsp; aside.&nbsp; The&nbsp; legal heirs of Marciana Nepomuceno,&nbsp;&nbsp; having&nbsp; established&nbsp; that they had&nbsp; already perfected their&nbsp; right&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; a final conveyance to them of the&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp; lot&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp; section&nbsp; 5&nbsp; of Executive Order No.&nbsp; 138,&nbsp;&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp; are&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; the benefits granted&nbsp; under the&nbsp; said executive&nbsp;&nbsp; order. Stops&nbsp; should now be&nbsp;&nbsp; taken&nbsp; toward&nbsp; the reinstatement&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp;&nbsp; sales certificate&nbsp; and the&nbsp;&nbsp; Issuance&nbsp; of the necessary deed&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; In favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp;&nbsp; legal heirs,&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x.</blockquote>This&nbsp; last&nbsp;&nbsp; order was affirmed&nbsp; on a motion Tor reconsideration but with the&nbsp;&nbsp; qualification&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was&nbsp; to&nbsp; be —<br><blockquote>“x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; without prejudice&nbsp; to any right which. Quintin Dones may have&nbsp; against the said heirs for the recovery of the&nbsp;&nbsp; amount&nbsp;&nbsp; of P1,000.00 which spears&nbsp; to have been borrowed by their&nbsp; (heirs') predecessor in interest,&nbsp;&nbsp; the late Marciana&nbsp; Nepomuceno,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; has not yet been paid&nbsp;&nbsp; up to the&nbsp; present."</blockquote>Not&nbsp; satisfied with&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp;&nbsp; order,&nbsp;&nbsp; even as&nbsp; thus&nbsp; qualified,&nbsp; Dones on December 26,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp;&nbsp; filed&nbsp; the present action in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp;&nbsp; of Cavite&nbsp; against&nbsp;&nbsp; the Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands and the heirs&nbsp; of Mar clan a Nepomuceno to have the order&nbsp; for the conveyance&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the lot&nbsp;&nbsp; to the&nbsp; sail&nbsp; heirs annulled and&nbsp;&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside&nbsp;&nbsp; and to have&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; at least half of it,&nbsp; deeded over&nbsp; to plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contesting the&nbsp; action,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Director&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; filed&nbsp; their&nbsp; respective&nbsp; answers,&nbsp;&nbsp; with the heirs setting&nbsp;&nbsp; up&nbsp; a counterclaim for&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; products harvested by Dones&nbsp; from the northern half&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; lot&nbsp;&nbsp; allegedly usurped by him through force and&nbsp; intimidation.<br><br>After trial, the court found (1) that the southern half of the lot was delivered to Dones by Marciana Nepomuceno and her husband as,security for a&nbsp; loan of P1,000 but&nbsp; that&nbsp; the mortgage&nbsp; and,&nbsp;&nbsp; in particular,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; cession&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; said half in payment&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; said loan&nbsp; was&nbsp; illegal and without effect, being a violation&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; section 15 of Act No.&nbsp; 1120 and forbidden by the&nbsp;&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of Marciana's&nbsp; soles&nbsp; contract with&nbsp; the Government; (2)&nbsp; that Dones&nbsp; obtained possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the northern half of the&nbsp; lot&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; aid&nbsp;&nbsp; of armed men and cultivated the&nbsp; same and&nbsp; appropriated the products thereof without&nbsp; diaring&nbsp;&nbsp; them with the., heirs;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; hairs&nbsp; had&nbsp; already perfected their right&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; repurchase&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lot from the&nbsp;&nbsp; Government in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the executive&nbsp; order already mentioned so&nbsp;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; the Director&nbsp; of Lands for the final&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyance&nbsp;&nbsp; of the said lot&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs was&nbsp; valid and legal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court, therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; rendered&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>“POR TODO EXPUESTO,&nbsp;&nbsp; se dicta sentencia&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; sobroseyendo la&nbsp;&nbsp; demand a&nbsp; con las&nbsp; costas&nbsp; al demandante;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; ordenando&nbsp; al&nbsp; dauandante&nbsp;&nbsp; a que&nbsp; en tregue&nbsp; a&nbsp; los herederos de Marciana Nepomuceno la parte Norte&nbsp; del Lote No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1899 y a entregarles, ademas sesenta cavanes de palay como renta correspondiente a los años agricolas de 1950-1951 y 1951-1952, y, en su defecto, el valor de los sesenta cavanes de palay, que asciende a QUINCE PESOS (P15.00) el cavan; y (c) ordenando al demante a develover a los hijos de Marciana Nepomuceno la parte Sur del Lote No. 1899 en la misma fecha en que los referidos herederos de Marciana Nepomuceno entreguen o paguen al demante la suma de MIL PESOS (P1,000.00), que debera hacerse dentro de un año desde que quede firme y ejeccutoria la decision en la presente causa.”<br></blockquote>Only plaintiff&nbsp;&nbsp; has appealed from the above&nbsp;&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; vital&nbsp;&nbsp; question appears to&nbsp; be&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands acted legally in&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; resale&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant heris. The&nbsp;&nbsp; appeal is made&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; rest&nbsp; on the&nbsp;&nbsp; contention&nbsp; that the&nbsp;&nbsp; order&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; conveyance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the whole&nbsp; lot&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is void,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the appellant's right to at least one-half of the lot should have been recognized. We find no merit in this contention.<br><br>The record is clear that&nbsp; the heirs complied with the requirements of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 5 of Executive&nbsp; Order No.&nbsp; 136,&nbsp;&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Philippine Executive&nbsp; Commission for the reinstatement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the cancelled sale&nbsp;&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of their predecessor-in-interest. That&nbsp; section.&nbsp;&nbsp; as may be noted,&nbsp;&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that any such&nbsp; cancelled. sale&nbsp; which covers a tract of land that has not yet been disposed of nay be reinstated for the&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of issuing a&nbsp;&nbsp; deed&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; conveyance therefor&nbsp; after the necessary revaluation has-been made and upon payment&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; price, provided&nbsp; the land&nbsp; does not&nbsp; exceed 10 hectares-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; lot in question does not&nbsp;&nbsp; exceed that&nbsp; area,&nbsp;&nbsp; being in&nbsp; fact&nbsp; 6.1995 hectares&nbsp;&nbsp; only,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; it&nbsp; is not&nbsp; disputed that&nbsp; when&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; heirs applied&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reinstatement of the&nbsp; sale&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; land had not&nbsp; yet been disposed of by the Government,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is also&nbsp;&nbsp; on record that following their application for reinstatement,&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs, with the revaluation waived,&nbsp;&nbsp; paid the balance&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; purchase price&nbsp; and were&nbsp; issued an&nbsp; official recent&nbsp; therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the requirements of&nbsp; the executive&nbsp; order&nbsp; for the&nbsp;&nbsp; reinstatement&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; sales&nbsp; contract already&nbsp; fulfilled,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Director of Lands was right&nbsp; in holding that&nbsp; the heirs had perfected their right to&nbsp;&nbsp; the conveyance&nbsp; of the lot&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; their favor.<br><br>The contention&nbsp; that the&nbsp; executive&nbsp;&nbsp; order&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; question was null&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; void&nbsp; as beyond the&nbsp; authority of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Executive&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; to promulgate&nbsp; is already answered&nbsp; in the decision&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; case&nbsp;&nbsp; of Arguieta et al,&nbsp;&nbsp; vs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Corcuera et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; G,&nbsp; R,&nbsp;&nbsp; G.R. L-3537, May 21,&nbsp; 1951, which upholds&nbsp; the&nbsp; validity of said executive&nbsp;&nbsp; order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And while&nbsp;&nbsp; it is true&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the order for the&nbsp;&nbsp; execution&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed&nbsp;&nbsp; of conveyance was not&nbsp; handed down&nbsp;&nbsp; until 1950,&nbsp;&nbsp; tho&nbsp;&nbsp; fact must not be&nbsp; overlooked that the grantee' s right to said conveyanes&nbsp; accrued&nbsp; during&nbsp;&nbsp; the Japanese occupation after&nbsp; compliance&nbsp; on their part&nbsp; of&nbsp; all legal&nbsp; requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; 1950 order was&nbsp; in reality nothing more&nbsp;&nbsp; than&nbsp;&nbsp; a confirmation&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; right&nbsp; long before acquired,&nbsp;&nbsp; which the Government&nbsp; could not&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp; any principle&nbsp;&nbsp; of equity and&nbsp; fair dealing refuse to recognize.&nbsp; That&nbsp; right did not&nbsp;&nbsp; lapse with the alleged abrogation of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; execution order upon the cessation of the Japanese regime,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For "when&nbsp; a right&nbsp; has arisen&nbsp;&nbsp; upon a contract or transaction in&nbsp; the nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; a contract,&nbsp;&nbsp; authorized by statute,&nbsp;&nbsp; and has been&nbsp; so far perfected that&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; remains to be&nbsp; done&nbsp;&nbsp; by the&nbsp; party asserting it,&nbsp; it&nbsp; has become&nbsp; vested&nbsp; and the&nbsp;&nbsp; repeal&nbsp; of the statute&nbsp; does not effect&nbsp; it 0r an action for its&nbsp; enforcement."&nbsp;&nbsp; (11 Am.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jur.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1199,&nbsp;&nbsp; citing Pacific Mail S.&nbsp; S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Co.&nbsp;&nbsp; v.&nbsp; Joliffe,&nbsp; 2 Wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.S.)&nbsp; 450&nbsp; 17 L.&nbsp; ed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 95.) And&nbsp; “ a right&nbsp;&nbsp; one vested&nbsp; does not require for its preservation the continued existance of the power by which it was acquired.” (Ibid., 1200, footnote 20, citing Chirac v. Chirac, 2 Wheat. (U.S) 259, 4 L. ed. 234.).<br><br>Any claim to&nbsp; preference&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; appellant based on the pretension that,&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp; a stipulation contained in the document&nbsp; executed by Marciana Nopomuceno and their husband in connection with&nbsp; the loan,&nbsp;&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; of&nbsp; one-half of&nbsp;&nbsp; tho&nbsp; lot&nbsp; given as security passed&nbsp; to&nbsp; him&nbsp; (appellant)&nbsp; upon failure&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; spouses to pay the&nbsp;&nbsp; loon&nbsp;&nbsp; at maturity,&nbsp;&nbsp; con not prosper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually the stipulation referred to did not&nbsp;&nbsp; provide&nbsp; for&nbsp; an&nbsp; automatic&nbsp;&nbsp; cession of the&nbsp; security&nbsp; upon default.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; nothing more&nbsp;&nbsp; than a promise&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; cede.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event,&nbsp;&nbsp; even&nbsp;&nbsp; considering it as an automatic&nbsp;&nbsp; cession,&nbsp;&nbsp; it would not be binding on tho Cove: view&nbsp; of Section 15 of Act 1120,&nbsp;&nbsp; which&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>“SEC&nbsp; 15. The Government hereby reserves the title each and every parcel of land sold under the provisions&nbsp; of tills Act&nbsp;&nbsp; until&nbsp; the full payment&nbsp; of all&nbsp; installments&nbsp; of purchase money arid interest by the purchaser has been made,&nbsp;&nbsp; and any sale&nbsp; or incumbrance made by him shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; Invalid&nbsp; as against&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of the Philippines Islands and shall be in&nbsp; all respects subordinate to its prior claim.”</blockquote>The decision gives appellant the right to retain the land until the debt of P1,000 is paid by the appellees. There being no complaint against this part of the judgment, we find no reason for disturbing it. And the same may be said as to that part of the judgment which orders the payment of rents for plaintiff's occupation of the northern half of the lot.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment below is affirmed, with costs,<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
