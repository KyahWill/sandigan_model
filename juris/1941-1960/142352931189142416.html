				<H3>PRIMITIVO P.  CAMMAYO, PETITIONER  AND APPELLANT,, VS. GUILLERMO VIÃ‘A, IN SUBSTITUTION FOR THE DECEASED CELESTINO V. RAMOS, RESPONDENT AND  APPELLEE.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the court below, petitioner&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; this action for <i>quo warranto</i> to test the legality and constitutionality of Administrative Order No.&nbsp; 73 issued&nbsp; by the President of the&nbsp; Philippines, removing petitioner herein from&nbsp; office as Assistant&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; as well as the appointment of the respondent Celestino V. Ramos as Assistant Fiscal of Manila to&nbsp; replace&nbsp; him.<br><br>There is practically no dispute&nbsp; as to the facts of the case.<br><br>The petitioner was a&nbsp; duly appointed Assistant Fiscal of Manila who took&nbsp; his&nbsp; oath of office&nbsp; on June 1, 1951.<br><br>On&nbsp; July 19,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; letters&nbsp; written by him&nbsp; to&nbsp; prisoner Domingo Bebania, then serving&nbsp; sentence for parricide at the New Bilibid Prisons in Muntinglupa, Rizal, were found in the latter's hut in a routinary inspection of the prisoners.<br><br>The letters were confiscated by the authorities of the prison and at the investigation&nbsp; of prisoner Bebania, he executed an&nbsp; affidavit stating therein, among other things, that the petitioner asked&nbsp; hint&nbsp; the sum of&nbsp; P200&nbsp; and a rooster so that he could work for Bebania's pardon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently, the Hon. Secretary of Justice charged the petitioner with dishonest conduct&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote> "In view hereof, you are hereby charged with dishonest conduct highly prejudicial to the&nbsp; best interest of the service and given five days from receipt hereof within which to submit to this&nbsp; Department a detailed answer thereto, together with whatever written evidence you may&nbsp; desire to&nbsp; present in support of your&nbsp; side. You are, however, advised that if you&nbsp; so&nbsp; elect,&nbsp; a formal investigation of the&nbsp; charge may be&nbsp; conducted, at which formal investigation you will be given the opportunity&nbsp; to defend yourself personally&nbsp; or by counsel.&nbsp; If&nbsp; you&nbsp; elect to have a&nbsp; formal investigation, you may make a request therefor&nbsp; in&nbsp; your&nbsp; answer." </blockquote>Petitioner chose a&nbsp; formal investigation,&nbsp; hence the Department of Justice&nbsp; appointed a special investigator to conduct&nbsp; a formal&nbsp; hearing"&nbsp; of the charges&nbsp; against the petitioner. Thereafter&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp;&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; was&nbsp; held&nbsp; where evidence was adduced both in&nbsp; support of the charges and in&nbsp; defense of&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation, the investigator found&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; guilty as charged and, on&nbsp; the basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; the findings of the&nbsp; investigator, the Secretary of Justice,&nbsp; in&nbsp; turn, recommended to His Excellency,&nbsp; the&nbsp; President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; the dismissal of the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon receipt of said recommendation, the President issued Administrative Order&nbsp; No. 73 finding the petitioner guilty of dishonest&nbsp; conduct highly prejudicial to the best interest&nbsp; of the service and removing&nbsp; him&nbsp; from the service effective upon receipt&nbsp; of said order, the most pertinent portions of&nbsp; which are as follows:<br><blockquote>"It is undisputed&nbsp; that prisoner&nbsp; Bebania&nbsp; solicited&nbsp; respondent's help to obtain his release from prison;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; respondent asked from Bebania the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P200 and a&nbsp; "Texas" rooster; and that the rooster&nbsp; was never delivered&nbsp; to the respondent.<br><br><center> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </center><br>"The sum total of the&nbsp; efforts exerted by the respondent in&nbsp; behalf of Bebania consisted, it appears, in writing and filing two petitions for executive clemency, the last of which was denied by the President on June&nbsp; 23, 1954. Whatever&nbsp; expenses these efforts&nbsp; entailed could&nbsp; not&nbsp; possibly have come up to P200.&nbsp; As&nbsp; to his request&nbsp; for a fighting cock, even on the assumption that is was really intended for his co-employees, the cold&nbsp; fact remains that he again unconsciously sought to take&nbsp; advantage of a poverty-stricken prisoner by attempting to take away the latter's poor possessions.<br><br>"The&nbsp; foregoing amply shows that the&nbsp; respondent is guilty of the charge.&nbsp; While&nbsp; respondent's&nbsp; actuations&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; had no connection with the discharge of his official duties and while he may not&nbsp; have actually&nbsp; succeeded in&nbsp; obtaining what he sought to obtain,&nbsp; yet his acts&nbsp; clearly show his&nbsp; moral unfitness for public, service. Observance of the&nbsp; highest standards&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; personal&nbsp; integrity and&nbsp; decorum is required of all public officials if the Government&nbsp; is to&nbsp; deserve the trust and&nbsp; confidence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the people, A fiscal, a&nbsp; vital&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the machinery for the&nbsp; administration of justice, who&nbsp; deceives a prisoner hungry for freedom and seeks to extract from him what&nbsp; little he possesses certainly falls far too short of those standards.<br><br>"Wherefore,&nbsp; Mr. Primitivo&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Cammayo&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; removed from office as assistant fiscal of&nbsp; Manila, effective upon receipt of notice hereof."<br></blockquote>On November 15,&nbsp; 1954, petitioner received&nbsp; copy of said order&nbsp; and shortly thereafter he filed with His Excellency, the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines,&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for its reconsideration,&nbsp; but it was denied for lack of merit.&nbsp; As immediately after the issuance of the Administrative Order No.&nbsp; 73,&nbsp; Celestino V. Ramos was&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; Ad interim Assistant Fiscal to&nbsp;&nbsp; replace the petitioner, the latter&nbsp; immediately instituted&nbsp; the present case on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that his removal from office was illegal, that the&nbsp; appointment of respondent Celestino&nbsp; V. Ramos was likewise illegal, and that Administrative&nbsp; Order&nbsp; No. 73&nbsp; was null and void because&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; against&nbsp; the petitioner the requirement&nbsp; of due process&nbsp; of&nbsp; law had not "been complied with,&nbsp; and (b) that the act of which he was found&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; legal&nbsp; ground&nbsp; for&nbsp; his removal. &nbsp;<br><br>After&nbsp; due hearing, the case was&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; mainly&nbsp; on the following grounds:<br><blockquote>"That the&nbsp; petitioner has&nbsp; been&nbsp; legally&nbsp; separated&nbsp; and&nbsp; removed from office&nbsp; can not be&nbsp; disputed.&nbsp; The&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the President was&nbsp; based&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; result of&nbsp; an&nbsp; investigation wherein the petitioner was&nbsp; given an opportunity to&nbsp; be heard and to present his&nbsp; defense.&nbsp; The&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; was&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; by&nbsp; order of&nbsp; the Secretary of&nbsp; Justice,&nbsp; who&nbsp; has&nbsp; general&nbsp; supervision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the office of the&nbsp; City Fiscal (Section 38, Republic Act No. 409,&nbsp; as amended by Sec. 2, of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 1201),<br><br>"The finding of the&nbsp; investigator&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioner is&nbsp; guilty of dishonest conduct highly prejudicial to the&nbsp; best interest&nbsp; of the service,&nbsp; is&nbsp; based&nbsp; on&nbsp; facts&nbsp;&nbsp; established&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing.&nbsp; It has&nbsp; been sufficiently proved&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioner sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; obtain some gifts from Domingo Bebania, Jr., a prisoner in Muntinglupa, who is serving&nbsp; sentence&nbsp; for&nbsp; parricide,&nbsp; in&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner's efforts&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure his&nbsp; pardon.&nbsp; The&nbsp; petitioner's letters&nbsp; to Bebania were&nbsp; all written on&nbsp; official&nbsp; papers bearing the letterhead of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiscal's&nbsp;&nbsp; Office.&nbsp; Evidently he&nbsp; intended&nbsp; to impress Bebania with his official position.<br><br>"That the petitioner's misconduct has no&nbsp; connection with the&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; duties as&nbsp; assistant&nbsp; fiscal is immaterial.&nbsp; As&nbsp; was said in&nbsp; the&nbsp; President's administrative&nbsp; order&nbsp; 'observance of&nbsp; the highest standards&nbsp; of&nbsp; personal&nbsp; integrity and decorum is required of all public officials if the&nbsp; government is to&nbsp; deserve&nbsp; the&nbsp; trust and&nbsp; confidence of the public'&nbsp; The petitioner was&nbsp; fount) guilty of dishonest&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; after&nbsp; proper&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; and&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; and such finding,&nbsp; which the court has no&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; alter, renders him&nbsp; unfit for the&nbsp; office of assistant&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; and undeserving&nbsp; of the trust and confidence&nbsp; of the public."<br></blockquote>Thereupon&nbsp; the petitioner appealed&nbsp; and in this instance he&nbsp; contends that the lower court&nbsp; erred:<br><blockquote>"I.&nbsp; In&nbsp; finding that, petitioner&nbsp; was&nbsp; legally removed from office and&nbsp; in&nbsp; not&nbsp; declaring administrative order No. 73 by the President of the&nbsp; Philippines removing&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; from&nbsp; office&nbsp; as&nbsp; assistant fiscal of Manila illegal&nbsp; and&nbsp; unconstitutional altho&nbsp; the dishonest conduct imputed to the petitioner as ground for his&nbsp; removal was according to the text of said&nbsp; administrative order,&nbsp; not related to nor&nbsp; connected with the&nbsp; performance of the official duties of&nbsp; assistant&nbsp; fiscal of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; and&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; was not&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; nor&nbsp; even prosecuted&nbsp; in court for&nbsp; its commission;<br><br>"II.&nbsp;&nbsp; In not finding that&nbsp; petitioner's removal from office&nbsp; as assistant&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila was&nbsp; in violation, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitutional and legal requirement on due&nbsp; processes of&nbsp; law&nbsp; when he was not given a fair and&nbsp; impartial hearing;<br><br>"III. In holding that the&nbsp; position of assistant fiscal&nbsp; of Manila which petitioner had been holding became vacant upon petitioner's removal&nbsp; from office,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that there&nbsp; was no usurpation and&nbsp; unlawful holding of&nbsp; the&nbsp; office by the&nbsp; respondent altho respondent was appointed to the same office in place of petitioner;<br><br>"IV.&nbsp; In denying the petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; <i>quo warranto</i> and in&nbsp; not rendering judgment in favor of the petitioner ousting&nbsp; and excluding the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; from&nbsp; office and reinstating petitioner&nbsp; to&nbsp; the office of assistant fiscal of&nbsp; Manila with&nbsp; the right&nbsp; to receive all the emoluments appurtenant to said office from date of his removal to his reinstatement in&nbsp; office."<br></blockquote>Upon careful consideration of appellant's contentions as embodied in the foregoing assignments of error,&nbsp; we&nbsp; find that the decisive one&nbsp; is whether&nbsp; he was removed from office without&nbsp; due process of law&nbsp; and whether the facts proven&nbsp; against him during" the investigation&nbsp; do constitute sufficient legal ground for his removal.&nbsp; Petitioner-appellant does not deny that there has been a formal hearing of the charges filed against him by the Department of Justice; that in that hearing, he was given opportunity to defend himself from said charges; that the investigator found him guilty&nbsp; of dishonest conduct highly prejudicial to the&nbsp; best interest of the service&nbsp; and accordingly the Department of Justice&nbsp; has recommended his removal to His Excellency, the President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines, and that the&nbsp; latter approved such recommendation and dismissed him from the service&nbsp; because of his&nbsp; moral unfitness for public service. Evidently,&nbsp; having these&nbsp; facts in&nbsp; view,&nbsp; it cannot be pretended that&nbsp; the&nbsp; constitutional provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; due&nbsp; process of law&nbsp; for the removal&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petitioner has not been complied with.<br><br>As to whether the cause for&nbsp; which he was&nbsp; dismissed constitutes a legal ground sufficient for his removal from office, we concur with the court below that the&nbsp; acts committed by the&nbsp; appellant as conclusively established by the evidence adduced&nbsp; during the investigation so that he could work for the pardon of prisoner Bebania who was at the time serving sentence for parricide, do constitute disgraceful conduct and show his moral unfitness for public service, especially for the position of a fiscal who is an officer entrusted&nbsp; with the duty&nbsp; to prosecute&nbsp; crimes.<br><br>It is&nbsp; vigorously&nbsp; contended by the petitioner-appellant that under Article XII, Section 4, of the Constitution which provides that "No officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be removed or suspended except for cause as provided by. law", the cause for&nbsp; which petitioner-appellant was&nbsp; removed was not one of those "provided by law." It cannot be denied, however, that the cause for which the petitioner was removed, as could be seen&nbsp; from the Administrative Order No. 73, does not constitute dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service&nbsp; which, pursuant to Section 6 of Rule XIII of the Civil Service Rules, are sufficient grounds for removal. And since the&nbsp; President of the Philippines is the&nbsp; administrative head of our Government&nbsp; and as&nbsp; such is empowered&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; from the service, after due investigation, any presidential appointee found guilty of the acts mentioned in the&nbsp; aforesaid Civil Service Rule, we&nbsp; are constrained to hold that the petitioner having been properly removed&nbsp; from office, the present action&nbsp; has&nbsp; no foundation in fact&nbsp; and in law and that the lower&nbsp; court correctly dismissed it.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed <i>in toto </i> without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L.,</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
