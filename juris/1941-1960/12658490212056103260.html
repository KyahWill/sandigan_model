				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by the defendants from the decision of 
the Court of First Instance of Manila.
<p align="justify">Plaintiff is a depositor in current account of the defendant 
bank, and had a balance of P3,687.21 in his favor as of December 29, 1941. 
During the early part of the Japanese occupation he had been making withdrawals 
from said account from February 4, 1942, to February 13, 1943, leaving on this 
last date a balance of P578.37. No deposit was made by the plaintiff during the 
period from December 29, 1941, to February 13, 1943, and for that reason the 
withdrawals had to be taken or paid out of the said prewar balance.</p>
<p align="justify">On February 18, 1943 he deposited P500, and during the year 
1944, he made the following deposits: P2,250 on January 7, P1,000 on February 2, 
P4,500 on April 13, P35,000 on April 19, and P50,000 on October 25, or a total 
of P93,250. From these deposits the plaintiff appellee had been making 
withdrawals, the last having been made on October 26, 1944, so that on December 
26, 1944, he had a balance in his favor amounting to the sum of P14,444.64, 
which, if added to the previous balance of P578.37, make a total of P15,023.01 
(Exhibit I).</p>
<p align="justify">Claiming that he is entitled to his entire balance of 
P15,023.01, and not only to that of P578.37 in Philippine currency, the 
plaintiff has instituted the present action in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila for declaratory relief in order to test the constitutionality of 
Executive Order No. 49, which, in its pertinent part, reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"All deposits made with banking institutions during enemy 
occupation and all deposit liabilities incurred by banking institutions during 
the same period are declared null and void, except as provided in this section. 
All withdrawals made by a depositor, including liquidation payments, during the 
enemy occupation from balances outstanding as of the last date prior to enemy 
occupation shall stand as valid, and banking institutions shall be liable only 
for the lowest minimum balance remaining out of such balance to the credit of a 
depositor on the last date prior to enemy occupation and without interest beyond 
December 31, 1941. The term 'lowest minimum balance' shall be understood to mean 
the lowest level reached as of the close of any business day during the period 
of the enemy occupation by a deposit account or, if there be more than one 
deposit account, by the consolidation of all deposit accounts carried under the 
name of one depositor in the same bank." (Section 2, Ex. Order 
49.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The above-quoted provisions of Executive Order No. 49 contain 
three parts. The first is a declaration that all deposits made with banking 
institutions during enemy occupation and all deposit liabilities incurred by 
them during the same period are null and void, except as provided therein; the 
second provides that all withdrawals made by a depositor, including liquidation 
payments, during the enemy occupation from balances outstanding as of the last 
date prior to enemy occupation shall stand as valid, and banking institutions 
shall be liable only for the lowest minimum balance remaining out of such 
balance to the credit of a depositor on the last date prior to said occupation; 
and the third or last is a definition of the term "lowest minimum balance" used 
therein.</p>
<p align="justify">In his complaint, the plaintiff impugns the constitutionality 
not only of the provision of the Executive Order No. 49 that declares valid the 
withdrawals made by a depositor, including liquidation payments during the enemy 
occupation from balances outstanding as of the last date prior thereto, and that 
banking institutions shall be liable only for the lowest minimum balance 
remaining out of such balance to the credit of a depositor on the last date 
prior to said occupation, but also that which declares null and void all 
deposits made with banking institutions during Japanese occupation and all 
deposit liabilities incurred by banking institutions during the same period 
except as therein provided. Consequently, the plaintiff prays that the court 
render judgment declaring the defendant bank indebted to plaintiff for the 
latter's entire credit balance as of December 26, 1944, in the amount of fifteen 
thousand and twenty-five (P15,025) pesos.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court did not uphold the plaintiff's contention that 
the provision of Executive Order No. 49 that declares null and void all deposit 
liabilities incurred by banking institutions during the Japanese occupation is 
unconstitutional, and that, therefore, the defendant bank was, on December 29, 
1948, and still is, indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of the latter's credit 
balance of fifteen thousand and twenty-five (P15,025) pesos as the plaintiff 
claimed. But the court declared that the defendant bank is indebted to the 
plaintiff in the sum of three thousand six hundred seventy-eight pesos and 
twenty-seven centavos (P3,678.27) which was the latter's credit balance as of 
December 29, 1941, on the ground that said Executive Order is null and void in 
so far as it validates the withdrawals during the enemy occupation from the 
prewar deposits, and invalidates all the deposits during the same period, except 
as therein provided.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court held that "it can not be questioned, and it is 
admitted by the defendants, that the relation existing between a bank depositor 
and the bank is that of creditor and debtor * * *. If this is so It necessarily 
follows that the plaintiff became a creditor of the defendant bank for the 
amounts deposited by him and credited to him by the bank. In so far therefore as 
said Executive Order No. 49 would deprive the plaintiff of his credit or could 
reduce the same to the lowest minimum balance defined in said order, it would 
seem undeniable that said law would be depriving him of his property and 
impairing the obligation of contract between him and the defendant bank implied 
in said deposit."</p>
<p align="justify">This conclusion of the lower court is predicated on the 
following grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Whatever may be said of the Japanese Military notes, as money, 
that is, as representing actual gold or silver reserves, it cannot be denied 
that in the hands of their possessor, said military notes represented real 
valueâ€”the value of the property or service given in exchange for said notes; in 
the same manner that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness 
represents real value to the holder thereof. The Court therefore seriously 
doubts the reasonableness of assuming, as the Executive Order No. 49 in question 
evidently does, that all the deposits made during the enemy, occupation were 
entirely valueless. But, aside from this, it is likewise clear that, whatever 
can be said of the money deposited, must also hold true as to the money used by 
the bank in paying withdrawals during the same period, and the Court cannot see 
the necessity or the justice for discriminating in this connection by declaring 
the deposits void, but the withdrawals from pre-war deposits valid, and limiting 
the present liability of the banks to the so-called lowest minimum balance 
reached by the accounts during the enemy occupation. The Court cannot somehow 
bring itself to reconcile with the manifest injustice and unfairness of so 
allowing the banks to repudiate their deposit liabilities incurred on account of 
their operation during the enemy occupation, and at the same time to retain and 
enjoy the benefits derived therefrom. Elementary justice and equity demand, in 
the opinion of the Court, that those deposits and withdrawals be considered 
either both equally void, or both equally valid.</p>
<p align="justify">"Furthermore, the Court finds that the lowest minimum balance 
provision in question is also unjust and unfair in its operation upon the 
depositors. The auditor of the defendant Bank, who took the witness-stand, 
admitted that, under the said provision, the validity of deposits made by prewar 
depositors during the enemy occupation depend entirely upon whether said 
deposits were made before or after the withdrawals. The Court understood his 
explanation to be that if two persons had deposits of P2,000 each, before the 
occupation, and during the occupation, one withdrew P1,000 first, and deposited 
the same amount afterwards; while the other deposited P1,000 first, and withdrew 
the same amount later on, today the first depositor will have only P1,000, while 
the second will still have P2,000. And yet the unerring fact stands that both 
had taken from and given to the Bank the same amount of money during the same 
period. The Court believes that any legal provision that can countenance and 
produce such obvious inequality and unjust result must indeed be fundamentally 
unsound. It is not good law. It does not certainly fulfil the requirement that 
'a statute to be within this (police) power must be reasonable in its operation 
upon the persons whom it affects.' "</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">As correctly explained on the witness stand by the auditor of 
the defendant bank, Mr. Santiago, the term "lowest minimum balance" means that 
if a prewar depositor who had P5,000 to his credit deposit, deposits during the 
occupation P1,000 and afterwards withdraws 1,000 pesos, his lowest minimum 
balance would be P5,000, because his withdrawal must be taken from the deposit 
of P1,000 previously made during the enemy occupation. But if the prewar 
depositor withdraws P1,000 before making any deposit during the occupation, the 
lowest minimum balance would be P4,000 even if he makes a deposit of P1,000 
after his withdrawal (Posadas, t. s. n. pp. 26, 27).</p>
<p align="justify">We are of the considered opinion, and therefore hold, that the 
provisions of Executive Order No. 49, do not deprive the plaintiff of his 
property without due process of law or impair the obligation of contract entered 
into between him and defendant bank; because they are but the logical corrolary 
and application to bank deposits in Japanese war notes of Executive Order No. 25 
in so far as it declares that said notes are not legal tender in territories of 
the Philippines liberated from Japanese occupation, the validity of which is 
not, and cannot seriously be, questioned.</p>
<p align="justify">According to universal banking practice the daily balance in a 
current account is ascertained by deducting the amount of the check drawn from 
the amount of money the drawer or depositor had deposited in the bank for that 
purpose, and if there is no balance in the depositor's deposit or the amount 
thereof is insufficient to pay his check, the latter is returned to him or not 
honored. The payment by a bank of the amount of a depositor's check is not a 
loan to the latter by the former which may be satisfied by a subsequent deposit, 
but a payment by the bank as debtor to the depositor as creditor, for it cannot 
be disputed that the relationship between a depositor and a bank is that of 
creditor and debtor. Such payment is valid and extinguishes so much of the 
obligation of the bank as is represented by the check paid or honored by the 
bank out of the latter's deposit, because according to the ruling in the cases 
of Haw Pia vs. China Banking Corporation (80 Phil., 602), and Philippine Trust 
Co. vs. Araneta (83 Phil., 132), a payment made by a debtor during the enemy 
occupation of a prewar debt or obligation with Japanese war notes and accepted 
by the creditor, is valid and extinguishes the former's obligation. But a 
deposit subsequently made by a depositor in a bank can not be considered as a 
payment of a debt due from the depositor to the bank, but an additional credit 
opened by said deposit in favor of the depositor and against the bank, and the 
liability of the latter for the payment of said credit upon demand after 
liberation has to be determined in accordance with the domestic law or rule of 
international law applicable to the case; because, as we shall see later on, the 
character of the war notes as legal tender or currency impressed by the Japanese 
military authorities during the enemy occupation did not and could not transcend 
beyond the enemy occupation or after the territory of the Philippines has been 
liberated from the enemy occupant. In other words, while the Japanese military 
occupant had authority to make the war notes legal tender or acceptable as such 
during the enemy occupation, it had no power to make it so or the obligation 
created therewith payable with the same amount of Philippine currency or legal 
tender after the liberation.</p>
<p align="justify">The lower court did not err in not declaring unconstitutional 
the Executive Order No. 49, in so far as it declares null and void all deposit 
liabilities incurred by banking institutions during the enemy occupation, except 
as provided in the same Order in connection with the lowest minimum balance, and 
consequently in not declaring that the defendant bank was indebted to the 
plaintiff as of December 26, 1944, in the sum of P15,023.01; but the court <i>a 
quo</i> erred and did not act logically in the sum of P3,678.27, instead of 
P578.37, since all of the deposits made by the plaintiff during the enemy 
occupation or from February 18, 1943, to October 25, 1944, were of the same 
nature and effect.</p>
<p align="justify">We have already held in the case of Haw Pia vs. China Banking 
Corporation, (80 Phil., 602) that the Japanese military occupant had the right 
to issue war notes as currency and order that they may be used in making payment 
of all kinds, due to military necessity. But such an order, being of political 
character, fell through as of course upon the cessation of the Japanese military 
occupation; because it is a well-established rule in international law that "the 
law made by the occupant within his admitted power, whether morally justifiable 
or not, will, bind any member of the occupied population as against any other 
member of it, and will bind as between them all and their national government, so 
far as it produces an effect during the occupation. When the occupation comes to 
an end and the authority of the national government is restored, either by the 
progress of operations during the war or by the conclusion of a peace, no 
redress can be had for what has been actually carried out but nothing further 
can follow from the occupant's legislation. * * *" (Westlake, International Law, 
seventh edition, p. 518; Peralta vs. Director of Prisons, 75 Phil., 285). 
Therefore, as the Japanese Military Proclamation of January 3, 1942, which 
declared the military war notes legal tender of the same value as the Philippine 
peso and acceptable as currency in payments of all kinds of obligations, ceased 
to be in force and effect, said war notes also ceased <i>ipso facto</i> to be 
legal tender in the territories of the Philippines liberated from Japanese 
occupation. And the Proclamation issued by General Douglas McArthur on October 
23, 1944, that declares null and void all laws, regulations and processes of the 
government established in the Philippines during the Japanese occupation, among 
them the said Japanese Military Proclamation of January 3, 1942, as well as 
Executive Order No. 25 issued by the President of the Commonwealth on November 
18, 1944, which declares that the Japanese war notes are not legal tender in all 
territories of the Philippines liberated from Japanese occupation, are but a 
declaration of the aforesaid well-known rule of international law.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the loss in value of the Japanese war notes after 
liberation, the question for this Court to determine is whether it is the 
plaintiff or the defendant bank that should suffer said loss, and the answer to 
that question depends upon the nature of the contract out of which arose the 
relation of creditor and debtor between them, because said relationship may 
arise out of a contract of loan, deposit, purchase and sale, and some other 
contract.</p>
<p align="justify">There is a conflict of opinion of the authorities in the United 
States as to whether a bank deposit is a loan (Leach vs. Beazley, 207 N. W., 
376), or a transaction peculiar to the banking business (Girard Bank vs. Bank of 
Penn. Twp., 39 Pa., 92; 80 Am. Dec., 507); but in this jurisdiction a bank 
deposit in current account is a transaction peculiar to the banking business, 
that is, a commercial deposit in accordance with article 310 of our Code of 
Commerce, which is still in force and provides that deposits made with the banks 
shall be governed in the first place by the by-law thereof, in the second place 
by the provision of this Code of Commerce, and finally by the rules of the said 
law which are applicable to all deposits. It is evident that it is a commercial 
deposit according to article 303 of the same Code, because the defendant bank or 
depositary is obviously a merchant within the meaning of article I of the Code 
of Commerce; the thing or money deposited is object of commerce, and the deposit 
of money in a bank is of itself a commercial transaction, for "it is an 
important part of the business of banking to receive deposits." (National Bank 
vs. Millard, U. S., 19 Law ed. p. 899.) Commercial transactions, whether or not 
performed by merchants and whether specified in the Code of Commerce or not, 
shall be governed by the provision contained in said Code, and in the absence of 
applicable provisions, by the commercial usages generally observed in each place 
(art. 2, Code of Commerce); and current account deposits are essentially 
mercantile contracts governed by the provisions of the Code of Commerce (Tan 
Tiong Tick vs. American Apothecaries, 65 Phil., 414.)</p>
<p align="justify">Although the current account of the plaintiff in the defendant 
bank was carried during the enemy occupation in terms of Philippine pesos, it is 
an undeniable fact that the deposits made by him during the years 1943 and 1944 
were made in Japanese war notes, which were given the denomination of Philippine 
pesos by the Japanese Military Government, for according to the defendant's 
answer No. 5 to plaintiff's request for admission, the genuine Philippine 
currency had then disappeared from circulation (Record on Appeal, p. 27) and of 
this fact the Court may take Judicial notice. The Japanese war notes, considered 
in themselves and in the light of subsequent events, had no real value but they 
were made current as Philippine pesos by order of the said government, and it is 
hardly less than absurd to say that they may be regarded as identical in kind 
and value with the genuine pesos of Philippine currency, which constitute the 
money of the Commonwealth Government now Republic of the Philippines.</p>
<p align="justify">It may safely be laid down as a rule that when a deposit is 
made with a bank or a person of notes made legal tender or currency by the 
military occupant of an enemy territory, and the occupation does not ripen into 
a conquest by the occupant because the territory is liberated and reoccupied by 
its legitimate government, the deposit must be considered as with specification 
of currency, that is, as a deposit of money made legal tender or currency by the 
occupant, without necessity of stating it expressly, unless there is evidence to 
the contrary, because it is the only kind of money or legal currency In 
circulation after the genuine money of the territory has disappeared from 
circulation, as in the present case. It should not be understood to be a general 
deposit without specification of currency, that is, a deposit of lawful money of 
the legitimate government, and it will have the same effect as if it were made 
with money that was legal tender or currency of a foreign country having no 
monetary treaty or agreement with the legitimate government; and therefore if 
such currency becomes valueless, the depositor shall have to suffer the loss, 
because the currency so deposited is exactly of the same condition and validity 
as that kept in the pockets or safe of the depositor.</p>
<p align="justify">Therefore, while it does not expressly appear that plaintiff's 
deposit in Japanese war notes were made with a specification of the currency 
deposited, the minimum requirements of justice demand that said deposits should 
be considered as made with an implied specification of currency, and hence 
article 307 of the Code of Commerce, which provides that "when the deposits 
consist in cash with specification of the currency constituting the same, * * * 
the increase or reduction in value suffered by the same shall be for the account 
of the depositor," is applicable to the present case.</p>
<p align="justify">Even if we consider <i>arguendo</i> the deposits under 
consideration as a loan from the plaintiff to the defendant bank, the deposit 
liability of the latter to the former after liberation for the credit balance of 
P15,023.01 as of December 26, 1944, would be less than P200 in Philippine 
currency, and therefore could not make up the difference between the lowest 
minimum balance of P578.37 and the sum of P3,678.27 in which, according to the 
lower court, the defendant bank is indebted to the plaintiff. Contracts 
stipulating for payments presumably in Japanese war notes may be enforced in our 
courts after the liberation to the extent of the just obligation of the 
contracting parties, and, as said notes have become, worthless, in order that 
justice may be done and the party entitled to be paid can recover their actual 
value in Philippine currency, what.the debtor or defendant bank should return or 
pay is the value of the Japanese Military notes in relation to the peso in 
Philippine currency obtaining on the date when and at the place where the 
obligation was incurred, unless the parties had agreed otherwise. In the absence 
of evidence of the value of the Japanese war notes in terms of Philippine 
currency, and for the purpose of this decision, we may adopt the Ballantine 
scale of values for the Commonwealth (now Republic) peso in terms of the peso in 
Japanese war notes during the occupation, which gives the ratio of 90 to 120 
pesos in Japanese war notes to one peso in Commonwealth currency on December 24, 
1944, the late of the last liquidation of the plaintiff's credit balance in the 
defendant bank, because from the last deposit of P50,000 made on October 26, 
1944, withdrawals were made by the plaintiff until December 26, 1944, when a 
credit balance of P15,023.01 was left in his favor.</p>
<p align="justify">This finds support in the decision of the Supreme Court of the 
United States in the leading case of Thorington vs. Smith, 8 Wall. (U. S.) 1; 19 
Law ed., 361, in which the question involved was whether a contract for the 
payment of $10,000 in confederate notes, made during the civil war between the 
parties residing within the Confederate States, could be enforced in the Courts 
of the United States after the war, and the Supreme Court held that parol evidence could be received to determine the actual value of the confederate 
notes at the time and place of the contract, in lawful money of the United 
States; and this rule was followed without exception by the same Supreme Court 
in the subsequent cases of Wilmington and W. R. N. Co. vs. King, 91 U.S., 3, 23 
Law. ed., 186; Bissel vs. Heyward, 96 U.S., 580; 24 Law. ed., 678, and Effinger 
vs. Kenney, 115 U.S., 556; 29 Law ed., 495; and others, in all of which the 
same of a similar question was involved.</p>
<p align="justify">The defendant bank could not enrich itself or obtain any 
benefit from the plaintiff's deposits with the said bank during the enemy 
occupation by the application or operation of Executive Order No. 49. Although, 
according to banking practice, current account deposits of legal currency made 
by depositors with a bank are, in normal times, used by the latter for paying 
its obligations and investing them in loans to its clients, in the present case, 
taking into consideration the progressive loss of value of said war notes and 
the considerable inflation of the value of properties which could be sold by the 
owner to obtain money in Japanese war notes necessary to satisfy his prime 
necessities, relatively few persons obtained loans or withdrew or collected 
their pre-war credits from banks, and large amounts of said money were deposited 
with them. And this is shown by the verified answers of the defendant bank to 
the interrogatories served by the plaintiff upon said defendant, which are 
transcribed on pages 21-24 of the Record on Appeal. In said interrogatories and 
answers it appears that the total balance of all deposits in the defendant bank 
as of the last date prior to Japanese occupation was approximately 
P78,638,238.57, and the total amount of withdrawals made during the occupation 
from said outstanding balances amounted only to P21,025,949.60; while the total 
balance outstanding on February 2, 1945, on deposits made during Japanese 
occupation was P146,465,290.99 more or less, and the total amount paid to the 
defendant bank during said occupation on loans and other credits outstanding in 
favor of the bank as of the last date prior to Japanese occupation was 
approximately P37,677,635.50. And the total amount of Japanese war notes held by 
the defendant bank on February 2, 1945, was P27,910,593.85, plus the total sum 
of P138,966,211.34, invested in bonds of the puppet Republic of the Philippines, 
in deposits with the Japanese reserve bank (Southern Development Bank), and in 
loans and credits granted to Japanese firms and individuals, and other 
investments considered valueless by the defendant bank.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and the 
plaintiff's action dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Pablo, Perfecto, Briones,
