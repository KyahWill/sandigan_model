				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In an order issued by Judge Pablo Villalobos, presiding over 
the Court of First Instance of Sulu, on October 31, 1947, it was declared taht 
said court has no jurisdiction over this case and ordered its dismissal with 
costs de oficio and the immediate release of the accused, and, at the same time, 
the transmittal of a certified copy of the complaint and supporting affidavits 
and of the amended information to the provincial fiscal and city attrorney of 
Zamboanga for such action as he may deem proper to take.
<p align="justify">The information in this case, dated August 28, 1947, reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The undersigned provincial fiscal accuses Salip Julmain, 
Alimponos Hadja and Insan-in Hadja of the crime of murder, committed as 
follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"That on or about the 19th day of January, 1947, in the seas 
between Zamboanga and Sulu Provinces, while the said accused were navigating on 
a vinta from Zamboanga City to Luuk, Province of Sulu, Philippines, and within 
the jurisdiction of this Court, the said accused with one slip Minsola, who is 
not yet apprehended, with malice afore-thought, conspiring together and helping 
each other and with deliberate intention to take the life of Moro Aye, did then 
and there, wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and suddenly and treacherously 
attack the latter with a spear, ax and paddle wounding him on his left breast 
and on the forehead both wounds being necessarily mortal, and being the direct 
and immediate cause of death of Moro Aye, after which his dead body was thrown 
overboard. All contrary to law."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It appears, however, according to the affidavits upon which the 
prosecution was initiated, that the alleged cirme of murder was committed in the 
seas between Zamboanga city and Basilan Island while both the deceased and the 
accused were enroute to the Island while both the deceased and the accused were 
enroute to the Island of Jolo on an unlicensed or unregistered vinta. Because of 
the crime, widow Ulka Aye and her children landed from the same vinta at 
Pangasaan, Basilan Island, although the vinta was chartered to carry them from 
Zamboanga to Kambing, Luuk, Sulu.</p>
<p align="justify">Section 14, paragraph 3, Rule 106, upon which the trial court 
issued the order in question reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<i>c</i>) Where an offense is committed on board a vessel 
registered or licensed in accordance with the laws of the Philippines, in the 
course of its voyage, the criminal action may be instituted and tried in the 
proper court of the first port of entry or of any municipality or province 
through which the vessel passed during such voyage."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The trial court declared that the above quoted provisions are 
not applicable to the present case because the vinta in question was 
unregistered or unlicensed and, therefore, the scene of the crime must be 
considered as an ordinary place and that, even assuming that the reglementary 
provisions above quoted may be applied, it appearing that the vinta stopped at 
Pangasaaan, BAsilan Island, under the jurisdiction of the Court of First 
Instance of Zamboanga, the latter is the one competent to try the case.</p>
<p align="justify">After a careful consideration of the undisputed facts of this 
case for the purposes of the appeal, and of the applicable law, we find no error 
in the appealed order. The vinta in question was unregistered or unlicensed and, 
therefore, is not wihtin the purview of section 14, paragraph c, of Rule 106, 
which contemplates a vessel registered or licensed in accordance with law. It 
appearing that the crime was committed in waters within the jurisdiction of the 
Court of First Instance of Zamboanga, the latter is the proper court to try the 
case. And, even if the vinta in question were licensed or registered, it 
appearing that the ifrst port of entry of the vinta was Pangasaan, Basilan 
Island, under the jurisdiction of said court, there cannot by any dispute that 
the case should be tried in Zamboanga. The appealed order is affirmed.</p> <i>Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
