				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of  the Court of First Instance of Rizal, presided over by Hon. Juan P. Enriquez, Judge, granting defendants'  motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint, upon the ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">res adjudicata.</span> <br><br>It appears that on  August 29,  1953, plaintiffs herein, the spouses Baltazar Raymundo and  Agapita San Juan, instituted Civil Case No. 2219 of the  Court of First Instance of Rizal, against the  very same defendants herein, namely, Felisa  A. Afable and Dominga Alvarez, as representative  of the estate of her deceased husband,  Braulio Santos, who  died on  March 27, 1953.  It was alleged in the complaint that  plaintiffs had been, were  and  are the registered owners of  a  house and lot, used  by them as bakery, situated in Pasig, Rizal, and covered by Original Certificate of Title  No. 3199 of the Register of Deeds of said province; that plaintiffs had mortgaged said property to Macondray  &amp; Co.—hereafter referred to  as the  company—to guarantee the  payment of a debt, the outstanding balance of which, as of August 29, 1931, was P3,000.00; that on August 11, 1931, plaintiffs reached an agreement with Mrs. Afable and said company,  whereby the rights of the latter as such  mortgagee would be transferred to Mrs. Afable; that, under the pretext that it was necessary to carry  out this agreement, on August 29,  1931, plaintiffs were induced by Mrs. Afable to  sign  a document which plaintiffs found in June 1945, to be one of sale of the  property in question to Mrs. Afable, in  consideration of the sum of P3,000.00 she  would pay  to the company; that Mrs. Afable succeeded thereby in  securing the cancellation of said Original Certificate of Title No. 3199 and the  issuance of  Transfer Certificate  of  Title No. 20666 in her favor, on November 21, 1931; that, believing that the  property in question was mortgaged to  Mrs. Afable, plaintiffs had  paid her  continuously,  from 1931 to  early in 1943, the sum of P30.00 a month, by way of interest, at the  rate of 12% per annum, the same rate charged by the company,  on the sum of P3,000.00; that in  1943,  plaintiffs tried to  redeem  the property by tendering payment in Japanese military notes, which  Mrs. Afable refused to accept upon  the ground  that she preferred to collect in the same currency paid by her to the company; that when they  again tendered payment to Mrs. Afable  in June, 1945, plaintiffs  learned  that  they no longer owned said property,  because  the  instrument  signed  by them  on August 29, 1931, was a  deed of sale of the property in question, not one for the transfer to Mrs. Afable of the real estate mortgage in favor of the  company;  that  on October 28, 1945, Mrs. Afable supposedly sold the property to  Braulio  Santos,  for  the alleged  consideration  of P22,000.00; that Transfer Certificate of Title  No. 20666, in the name of Mrs. Afable, was, therefore, cancelled, and Transfer  Certificate of Title  No.  48269,  in the  name  of Braulio Santos,  was issued on October 29,  1945;  that,  on October  23,  1946,  Santos instituted  an  ejectment  case against plaintiffs herein in the Justice of the Peace Court of Pasig,  Rizal, which  rendered  judgment in favor  of Santos; that on appeal, the  Court  of First Instance  of Rizal dismissed  the case  on December  31,  1948,  for lack of jurisdiction;  that, on appeal to the  Court of Appeals, the same rendered judgment on April 7, 1951,  in  favor of Santos; that on June 30,  1953, the Supreme Court  reversed the decision of the  Court of Appeals and affrmed that of the Court of  First Instance for lack of jurisdiction of the Justice  of  the Peace Court of Pasig, Rizal, over  the subject matter of the case; that, by reason  of the bad faith of Mrs.  Afable,  plaintiffs had suffered  damages in  the  total sum of P20,000.00;  that the right  of Mrs. Afable to recover from the plaintiffs the sum of  P3,000.00 by her paid to the company has prescribed already;  that,  as a mere transfer of the  real  estate  mortgage  in favor  of  the company,  Mrs. Afable had no right to sell the property or otherwise disposed of it; and  that its sale by Mrs. Afable to Braulio Santos should be declared  null and void.  Plaintiffs prayed, therefore, in said Case No. 2219: <br><blockquote>"* * *   (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That  Dominga Alvarez,  the surviving  spouse of Braulio Santos  or  any other  person who  may be  recommended  by  her, be appointed as legal representative of  the estate  of Braulio Santos;  (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That, after due hearing, judgment be rendered ordering the defendants Feliza  A.  Afable and the estate of  Braulio Santos to pay jointly and severally to the  plaintiffs the sum of  P20,000.00, as losses and damages;  (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) that the alleged sale made by Feliza A. Afable to Braulio Santos of the property involved in this action on October 28, 1945, be declared null and void, and transfer certificate of title No. 48261 in the name of Braulio Santos  together  vith  transfer certificate of title No. 20666  in the name of Feliza  L  Afable be ordered  cancelled  and  a new certificate of title be issued in  the names of the plaintiffs; (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)  that the right of action of the defendant Feliza A. Afable,  if she  had  any,  to recover from  the herein plaintiffs the sum of P3,000.00  which  she  had paid  to  Macondray  and Company, Incorporated, be declared to have already  prescribed, and  (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) that the plaintiffs be  granted any  other just  and  equitable remedy which the facts of this  case and the law applicable thereto  may warrant,  plus the costs of the  action." </blockquote>                   On motion of Mrs. Afable, the  Court of First Instance of  Rizal, by  an order dated  October 23, 1953,  dismissed the case, upon the ground that plaintiffs' cause  of action had accrued in June, 1945,  when  the fraud allegedly committed by Mrs. Afable was discovered by them, according to  the complaint;  that  they had four (4) years only to  secure relief  against such fraud,   pursuant to  section 43(3)  of Act No. 190; and  that plaintiffs  were,  accordingly, barred by the Statute of Limitations, when they instituted  said Case No. 2219  on  August 29, 1953.  This order  of dismissal  was  affirmed  by the Supreme  Court (G. R. No. L-7651)<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> on  February 28,  1955. <br><br>Soon thereafter, or on June  1, 1955, plaintiffs  instituted the case at bar, against the same defendants in the first case.  In their  second complaint,  which was docketed  as Civil Case No. 3638, of the  Court of  First Instance of  Rizal,  plaintiffs  allege that  they have been and are the  registered owners of the property above  referred to, as per Original  Certificate of Title No.  3199  of Rizal; that,  in August 1931, Mrs. Afable agreed to be subrogated into  the rights  of  Macondray  &amp;  Co.,  by  virtue  of  a  real  estate mortgage constituted in its favor to  secure payment of a debt  of  the plaintiffs, the balance  of which amounted to P3,000.00, with the obligation on the part of plaintiffs to pay Mrs. Afable the same  rate of interest  (12% per annum)  they used to pay to said company; that,  pursuant to this agreement, Mrs. Afable paid the sum of P3,000.00 due to the company,  which, in turn, ceded its  right,  as mortgagee, to  Mrs. Afable; that,  from September 1931 to April  1945, plaintiffs had paid to Mrs. Afable the interest on  said  mortgage indebtedness  at the rate of  P30.00  a month; that when plaintiffs tried to redeem the property in  June,  1945, they learned for the first time  that  Mrs. Afable had already secured Transfer Certificate of  Title No. 20666 in  her name;  that plaintiffs  have  been  continuously and still are in exclusive possession of the  property  in question; that the aforementioned real estate mortgage had  never been foreclosed; that, this  nothwithstanding, Mrs. Afable had  on October 28, 1945, sold the property to Braulio Santos,  who died on March 27, 1953, for the  alleged consideration of P22.000.00, said  Santos knowing that  she did not  own  said property,  that the same  "was merely  mortgaged to  her, and that plaintiffs have  been and still are engaged, in the premises  of the property in question,  in the bakery business and  in the sale of bread  and other allied  products and groceries; that, in view of the aforementioned  sale  to Braulio Santos, he secured, on  October 29, 1945, the cancellation  of  Transfer Certificate of  Title  No. 20666  in the name of  Mrs. Afable, and the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 48261 in his  name; and that, on October  23, 1946, Santos  instituted   ejectment  proceedings,  against  plaintiffs,  in the Justice of the  Peace  Court of Pasig, Rizal, for the purpose of taking  possession of the property  in dispute,  but, on appeal  to  thy  Supreme Court,  the  case was dismissed  on  June 30, 1953, for want of jurisdiction their complaint herein, that judgment be rendered. <br><blockquote>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)  declaring  the  herein  plaintiffs to be still  the owners of the property the object of the action; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)  adjudging that the right of action of the defendant Felisa A. Afable, if she had any, to foreclose the mortgage in her favor  of  the said property to guaranty the payment of the sum of P3,000.00 plus interest,  has already  prescribed; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) decreeing that the deceased  Braulio  Santos was  a purchaser in bad faith of the said property, in which case transfer certificate  of title No. 48261 of the Register of Deeds of  Rizal be cancelled and another transfer certificate of title  for the same property be issued in the name of the herein  plaintiffs and  (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)  that the plaintiffs be granted any other just and equitable remedy which the facts of this case and the law applicable thereto may  warrant, plus the costs of the action."</blockquote>The issue before us is whether the present case  is barred by our decision in the first case.  Obviously, the  answer must be  in the affirmative, for the parties are the same and they  represent the  same  interest, the subject matter is the same property, and the same cause  of action is involved.  What is  more,  the two cases were instituted before  the  same  court,  the  jurisdiction  of which  is  not contested, and, for all legal purposes, the  decision in the  first case disposed of the  merits of  the  cause of action asserted therein.                                                    <br><br>Plaintiffs argue that the cause of action herein is  not  the same as that of the first case, because the same sought  relief  against  the fraud  allegedly  committed  by Mrs. Afable, whereas the purpose of the present action is, they say, merely to clear the  title to the property above mentioned.   It is  further urged, in support  of this pretense, that plaintiffs' claim, in  the first  case, to the effect, that the ownership and title to  the property in dispute were involved therein had been rejected by the lower court,  and  that the action of the latter was affirmed by  the Supreme Court, as  if  we, likewise held, that  the ownership and title to said property were  not in  issue therein.   Nothing  can be further from the truth.                                    <br><br>It will be recalled that a motion to dismiss the first case was  filed  upon the ground  of prescription  of action, and that the  order of  the  lower  court  granting the  motion  was  affirmed  by this Court.  The issue  thus raised and   settled was whether plaintiffs' action  was  barred  by  the statute of limitations.   This, in turn, hinged on the period of limitation, or, more specifically, on the statutory  provision, applicable to the case.  Plaintiffs asserted then that it was section 40 of Act No. 190, which provides the period of ten (10) years  for the recovery of title  to, or possession of,  real property.   The defendants in turn invoked section 43 (3)  of said Act,  pursuant to  which "an action for  relief on  the ground of fraud"  may be brought within four  (4) years.  The lower  court  sustained the latter view, relying upon our decision in Rone vs. Claro &amp; Baquiring, (91  Phil., 251), in which we  said among  other things: <br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">It may be</span> that the recovery of title and possession of the lot was the  <span style="font-style: italic;">ultimate</span> objective of  tile plaintiffs, but t<span style="font-style: italic;">o attain that goal  they must need first travel over the road of relief on the ground of fraud </span>* * *."</blockquote>It  is not true,  therefore,  that the lower court  found that the ownership and possession of the  lot in dispute were not the subject matter of the first case.  It declared, however, that for  the purpose of determining the applicable period of prescription, the  means availed  of by  plaintiffs—namely, the annulment of the  conveyance by Mrs. Afable—was the decisive factor.  And this conclusion  was what we sanctioned in our decision in that case. <br><br>The issue thus settled  before is what plaintiffs now seek to  reopen  in the case at bar.   Indeed,  in  view, not only of  the deed of conveyance executed by them in favor of Mrs. Afable, and the issuance of a transfer certificate of title in favor of the latter, upon cancellation  of the transfer certificate of title  in  favor of the plaintiffs, but, also, of the deed  of conveyance subsequently executed by Mrs. Afable in  favor of Braulio Santos and the consequent issuance of  a transfer  certificate of title in his favor, upon cancellation of said transfer certificate of title in the name of  Mrs. Afable, how  could we  declare that plaintiffs  still own  the property in dispute and are entitled to its  possession, without annulling said  two (2)  deeds  of conveyance?  And how could such annulment be decreed without holding that both  deeds are tainted with fraud—the first, upon the ground that Mrs.  Afable had  induced plaintiffs to believe that it was a mere authority  for her to substitute Macondray &amp; Co. as plaintiffs' mortgage creditor, and the second upon the ground that Mrs. Afable and Braulio Santos knew that she had no right to dispose of the property and that the same belonged to plaintiffs herein?   In  fact, there is in the case at bar more reason  to apply the   conclusion reached by us in the first case, because plaintiffs  alleged  therein that  Mrs.  Afable,  not Braulio Santos,   was guilty  of fraud, whereas now plaintiffs, in effect, aver that even Braulio Santos had, likewise, acted fraudulently. Incidentally, this additional  claim  is obviously  due to the circumstance that, in our decision in the first case, we likewise said that:                                                    <br><blockquote>"* *  *  in view of the issuance of certificates of title, another line of         approach conclusive against plaintiffs' side suggests itself:  There being no allegation of bad faith against Santos, his purchase  of the  duly registered title of  Afable may not be  revoked even if Afable,         as alleged in  the complaint, obtained it thru fraud.  Consequently plaintiffs' action for annulment of the deed of  sale will necessarily fail."</blockquote>                                                            It is  clear, therefore,  that plaintiffs'  cause of action in the first case is  identical to their cause of action  in   the case at bar, and that the same is, accordingly, barred by  the decision rendered  in  the former case, for which  reason the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against plaintiffs-appellants.   It  is so ordered.                 <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon,  Montemayor,  Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B.
