				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Court of First Instance of Abra found the defendants Leonora Talledo and 
Buenaventura Timbreza guilty of murder and sentenced them both to <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em>, to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of Gregorio Preza 
in the amount of P2,000 with the accessories of the law and to pay the costs. To 
reverse the judgment of conviction, the two accused have brought the case here 
on appeal.
<p>On July 9, 1946, at about 8:30 p.m., Gregorio Preza and Adriano Billen on 
their way to attend a meeting in the house of the barrio lieutenant of 
Quimalaba, Dolores, Abra, stopped at the house of Juan Timbreza. Before reaching 
said house Billan in passing by the house of appellant Leonora, was requested by 
her to ask Gregorio to come to her house because she wanted to see him. When 
informed of this desire of Leonora, Gregorio left the house of Juan Timbreza and 
repaired to Leonora's abode. Upon entering her door he was shot in the stomach 
by a man who was hiding behind the panel of the door. Gregorio immediately 
unsheathed the bolo he was carrying and attacked his assailant, hitting him four 
or five times. His assailant fled from the house; so did Leonora. Gregorio then 
shouted for help, in response to which, Billen came. He found Gregorio still in 
the house of Leonora. He asked Billen to help him because according to him 
Leonora had him shot, at the same time expressing the opinion that his assailant 
was "if not Alejandro Talledo, Venancio Talledo; if not, the one who was boloed 
by him." (testimony of Billen) From the house of Leonora, Gregorio with the help 
of Billen was able to walk to and go up the house of his mother-in-law about 150 
meters away, where the Justice of the Peace took from him a written statement 
(Exh. F) with its translation (Exh. F-1) at about midnight. Four hours later, 
that is to say, at 4 o'clock the following morning he died of his gunshot 
wound.</p>
<p>In his statement (Exh. F), Gregorio told the Justice of the Peace that he 
supposed that it was Venancio Talledo who shot him but that to be sure, his 
attacker may be identified by the bolo wounds inflicted on him by Gregorio. He 
further stated that he maintained amorous relations with Leonora who called him 
to her house that night; that upon meeting her at the door of her house, she 
pleaded with him, asking that he pity her and that he should comply with their 
agreement; that it was then that he was shot from behind the door, after which 
he attacked his assailant with his bolo.</p>
<p>Acting upon the information contained in this written statement, as well as 
that given by Billen, the police contacted Venancio Talledo but finding that he 
bore no wounds, they continued their search until they found the appellant 
Buenaventura Timbreza who had fresh bolo wounds on his head, arms, and hands and 
who readily admitted that the wounds were inflicted by Gregorio. He was arrested 
and during his confinement and investigation, he made written statements (Exhs. 
H and I) ratified before the Justice of the Peace of Dolores in which he 
admitted having fired the shot that killed Gregorio in pursuance of Instructions 
given to him by Leonora who even gave him the gun (paltik) and who promised him 
that he would not in any way be implicated in the case; and that she promised to 
pay him for shooting Gregorio.</p>
<p>When questioned by the police, Leonora made an elaborate statement which she 
even ratified before the Justice of the Peace, to the effect that on the night 
in question, while she was sleeping, the deceased came up to her house, kissed 
her, seized her hands and pulled her up to her feet and took her to the door 
where he tried to abuse her; that she wanted to cry out for help but that 
Gregorio threatened her with his gun; that finding that it was impossible to 
physically resist the intruder, she adopted another strategy and spoke to him in 
a gentle and conciliatory manner, caressed him and took hold of his hand that 
was holding the revolver and succeeded in maneuvering said hand as well as the 
gun until the end of the barrel pointed to Gregorio's body at which instant, she 
pressed the trigger and shot him. She further stated that Gregorio had been 
courting her for about six months and that she rejected his advances because he 
was a married man.</p>
<p>At the trial however, Leonora claiming that the contents of her statement 
were false and had merely been taught her by the Chief of Police, told a 
different story, namely, that the deceased came up the house and tried to rape 
her; that she shouted for help and evidently one person came to her aid; that 
not long after her cry for help, she heard a noise at her door and Gregorio 
evidently hearing the same noise, got up from her bed and went to the door, and 
that soon thereafter she heard the shot that wounded Gregorio. Then she jumped 
down from the house and ran to the house of her uncle Quintin Talledo.</p>
<p>On the witness stand, Timbreza abandoning the story told by him to the police 
as contained in his affidavits (Exhs. H and I), even claiming that he signed 
said affidavits to avoid suffering and further pain when the police pressed his 
wounds, told the court something else, evidently to fit into the mental picture 
of the event given by Leonora at the trial. He said that hearing the shouts for 
help of Leonora, he went up her house unarmed; that at the door he was 
immediately attacked by Gregorio with a bolo; that he retreated until the two 
men reached the kitchen porch (batalan) where Gregorio pressed his bolo attack; 
that during this unequal struggle, Timbreza saw something gleaming, fall from 
the waist of Gregorio; that he stopped in his efforts at defense, stopped and 
picked up the object which happened to be a <em>paltik</em> and held it in his 
hand; and that when Gregorio struck another bolo blow, his hand was hit causing 
the gun which he was holding to explode or fire.</p>
<p>We agree with the Solicitor General that this story is quite fantastic and is 
incredible. We are satisfied that the version given by Timbreza to the police as 
contained in his affidavits is the correct one; and that the trial court 
committed no error in accepting said affidavits as competent evidence, having 
been made voluntarily by the affiant. As to Leonora's story told in court, we 
equally reject it as did the trial court as not true. People do not usually go 
up other's houses at about 8:30 in the evening to rape women Inmates therein, 
especially, in a neighborhood where the houses are near each other, and much 
more when there are other people in said houses, as was true in this case, 
because Leonora's mother-in-law was lying down near her that night. There were 
houses near that of Leonora, and those of her brother and of her uncle were 
quite near, both within calling distance, but strange to say, despite her 
alleged desperate cries for help, neither one of them responded.</p>
<p>Counsel for the appellant questions the propriety of the admission of the 
statement of Gregorio (Exh, "F" and its translation Exh. "F-1"), claiming that 
there is no proof that at the time of making the statement, Gregorio believed 
that he was going to die, this, because when asked by the Justice of the Peace 
whether or not he believed that he was going to die, he answered:"May be, 
Judge." Examining the original statement (Exh. "F"), we find that the phrase 
used by Gregorio in his native dialect was "cas la casta". Said phrase may be 
translated into "may be" as was done in Exh. F, But it may equally mean "so it 
seems" or "most probably" or "I believe so". Considering the fact that Gregorio 
was being questioned, apparently by a superior in the social scale, and a 
Government official at that, we may regard his answer "cas la casta" as a 
positive belief and assurance but expressed modestly, mildly and courteously by 
a humble barrio resident to a Judicial officer. We therefore find as did the 
trial court that at the time Gregorio made his statement, he was conscious of 
his impending death. Moreover, the fact that Gregorio died four hours later, 
shows that his wound was not only fatal but that he must have been in a critical 
condition at the time of making the statement as further testified to by the 
Justice of the Peace who described the physical condition and appearance of 
Gregorio at the time as he was slowly bleeding to death due to the apparently 
unchecked flow of blood from his wound. The doctor told the court that Gregorio 
died of hemorrhage. Three pellets had plowed thru the stomach, spleen and the 
large and small intestines.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even without this dying declaration, we have the spontaneous 
statement made by Gregorio to Billen, as the latter came to his aid in response 
to his cry for help, describing the person who shot him as one who must have 
sustained several bolo wounds and implicating Leonora as the person who had him 
shot. Said statement is admissible as part of the <em>res gestae</em>.</p>
<p>Considering all the evidence in the case, together with the circumstances 
surrounding the same, we are satisfied that Gregorio a married man and Leonora 
had been maintaining amorous relations; that possibly Leonora became 
dissatisfied with her disadvantageous and precarious situation or that Gregorio 
did not live up to a promise or agreement, vital to her interests and so she 
induced and employed her co-defendant Timbreza to shoot him when he came up to 
her house in response to her summons. Both appellants are clearly guilty of 
murder, Leonora as principal by induction and Timbreza as principal by actual 
participation, the killing having been committed with the qualifying 
circumstance of treachery.</p>
<p>Some members of the tribunal believe that because of the alleged existence of 
some aggravating circumstances, such as premeditation, consideration of a price, 
reward or promise, and the use of craft, the penalty of death should be meted 
out to the appellants. Other members however, are of the opinion that the 
evidence as to the existence of such alleged aggravating circumstances is not 
strong, much less conclusive. For instance, the alleged planning of the killing 
and the promised reward described in the affidavit of Timbreza even if all true, 
cannot be considered against his co-defendant Leonora for the reason that an 
extra-judicial admission or confession is admissible only against the one making 
it. Neither may the supposed aggravating circumstance of price or reward be 
considered against Leonora for the reason that it was not she who committed the 
crime in consideration of said price or reward. Besides, these aggravating 
circumstances with the exception of that of premeditation were not alleged in 
the information, and were not mentioned or discussed in the decision appealed 
from, neither were they considered by the Office of the Solicitor General for 
purposes of increasing the penalty imposed by the trial court. All that the 
Solicitor General asks for, is the confirmation of said decision. Furthermore, 
considering the case as a whole, some Justices believe that the appellants will 
be sufficiently punished with the imposition of the penalty of <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em>. This, aside from the fact that because of lack of sufficient 
votes, the extreme penalty of death cannot here be imposed.</p>
<p>Finding no reversible error in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby 
affirmed with costs.</p>
