				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE VS. BOTO BALONTO, ET AL., DEFENDANTS. BOTO BALONTO DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>DIZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Boto Balonto, Antonio Lumbos, Montos Moso and Turing Moso were charged with 
murder in the Court of First Instance of Cotabato. Upon arraignment Turing Moso 
pleaded guilty and was correspondingly sentenced. After trial on a plea of not 
guilty Lumbos was acquitted, while Montos Moso was found guilty, by direct 
participation, , and Balonto, by induction, of the offense charged.
<p>Balonto and Montos Moso appealed but the latter, on December 22, 1958, 
withdrew his appeal.</p>
<p>At noon on July 31, 1951, Emilio Suazo, Tony Mondares, Jesus Olarte and one 
named Sany were returning to San Jose, Buayan, Cotabato, in a jeep driven by 
Olarte, after spending the morning at Siguil looking for shrimps. At barrio 
Lobo, of the same municipality, Olarte stopped the jeep so that Mondares, who 
was seated beside him, could get off to remove a log placed across the road. At 
that juncture, shots were fired from the left side of the jeep, hitting Olarte 
on the breast. Suazo and Sany jumped out of the jeep and together with Mondares 
started running towards barrio Siguil. Upon reaching said place they told one 
Pedro Sanudo what had happened, so the latter, together with the three and other 
persons, went to Lobo where they found the dead body of Olarte in the jeep.</p>
<p>Soon after the incident, as a result of information furnished by Benito 
Flansal and Sanaon Onggi to the effect that Balonto, Lumbos, Montos and Turing 
Moso were most probably the killers because they hated the deceased, the Chief 
of Police of Buayan, D. Torcuator, investigated them A few days later Balonto 
made the sworn statement Exhibit A, taken down in English and translated to him 
in Tagalog by the chief of police and sworn to before Justice of the Peace 
Yapchiongco. Among other things, he stated therein that his stepson Turing Moso 
was the one who shot Olarte j that he had quarreled with Olarte several times 
because the latter not only had grabbed his land but also had taken to his house 
the wife of his (affiant's) son; that prior to the incident he talked with 
Turing Moso of the plan to kill Olarte, their agreement being that Montos and 
Turing Moso would leave that night for Siguil to kill Olarte, affiant having 
given his carbine to them; that in the afternoon of July 31, 1951 he was 
informed by Montos that Olarte had already been killed.</p>
<p>Turing Moso also made the written statement Exhibit B taken down in English 
by the chief of police and translated in Tagalog by Judge Yapchiongco before 
Turing Moso swore to it and signed it. In said statement Turing Moso admitted 
haying shot and killed Olarte by order of Antonio Lumbos and Boto Balonto.</p>
<p>Montos Moso also made a sworn statement (Exhibit C) under the same 
circumstances. Before he swore to it and signed it, it was translated to him in 
the bilaan dialect by one Pinis Bagotao. He also states therein that he and 
Turing were ordered by Lumbos and Balonto to kill Olarte.</p>
<p>The first contention of appellant Balonto is that his sworn statement Exhibit 
A is not admissible in evidence because he was virtually forced and intimidated 
into signing it. This contention is without merits. The prosecution evidence 
clearly shows that Balonto made and signed the statement voluntarily and freely. 
When, he appeared before the justice of the peace for that purpose he said 
nothing about the threats and intimidations now claimed. In fact, the 
prosecution evidence shows that the justice of the peace first inquired from him 
if he was aware of the contents of the statement, to which he gave an 
affirmative answer. The chief of police likewise testified not only that no 
threats were employed but that no promise of immunity was given to induce 
Balonto to sign the statement.</p>
<p>The second contention of appellant is that the trial court also erred in 
admitting against him the sworn statement of Montos Moso (Exhibit C), in spite 
of the fact that the same was hearsay because the interpreter alleged to have 
translated its contents to him was not presented as a witness.</p>
<p>This point is also without merit. While it might have been better if the 
prosecution had placed Bagotao, the interpreter, on the witness stand, that was 
not necessary to make the statement admissible, the testimony of the chief of 
police being sufficient to prove the fact that the same was translated to the 
affiant before the latter signed it in the presence of Justice of the Peace 
Yapchiongco. Moreover, it appears that the contents of the statements already 
mentioned are substantially corroborated by other facts established by 
independent evidence, such as the existence of the big log across the highway; 
the finding of two carbines used in the killing precisely in the place indicated 
by Montos-on a hilltop 200 meters from the house of Balonto; the fact that the 
circumstances under which the ambush was committed, as described by the 
prosecution witnesses, tally with those described by the, affiants in their 
statements.</p>
<p>Appellant also claims that he should be acquitted on the strength of the 
testimony of Turing Moso that he alone was responsible for the crime. The trial 
court chose not to believe such testimony because Turing testified for appellant 
after he had pleaded guilty, so he had nothing to lose by admitting all the 
blame, while by doing so he could save appellant, his stepfather, as well as his 
brother. His bias, or interest is, therefore obvious. Consequently, we find no 
reason to disagree with the lower court in this respect. </p>
<p>The penalty for the offense, committed is <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its 
maximum period to death, and there being in this case no aggravating nor 
mitigating circumstance to consider, the medium period thereof should be 
imposed, to wit <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. The penalty imposed by the trial 
court is modified accordingly. Similarly, the indemnity of P4,000,00 to be paid 
by Boto Balonto should be raised to P6,000.00. (People <em>vs</em>. Banlos, G.R. 
No. L-3413, Dec. 29, 1955).</p>
<p>Modified as above indicated, the decision appealed from is affirmed in all 
other respects, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, 
Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed with modification.</em></p></div>
