				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Frisco Holgado was charged in the Court of First Instance of 
Romblon with slight illegal detention because according to the information, 
being a private person, he did "feloniously and without justifiable motive, 
kidnap and detain one Artemia Fabreag in the house of Antero Holgado for about 
eight hours thereby depriving said Artemia Fabreag of her personal liberty."
<p>On May 8, 1948, the day set for the trial, the trial court proceeded as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Court:</p>
<p>Is this case ready for trial?</p>
<p>"Fiscal:</p>
<p>"I am ready, your Honor.</p>
<p>"Court:—to the accused</p>
<p>"Q Do you have an attorney or are you going to plead guilty?—</p>
<p>A. I have no lawyer and I will plead guilty.</p>
<p>"Court:</p>
<p>Arraign the accused.</p>
<p>"Note:</p>
<p>"Interpreter read the information to the accused in the local dialect after 
which he was asked this question.</p>
<p>"Q. What do you plead?—</p>
<p>A. I plead guilty, but I was instructed by one Mr. Ocampo.</p>
<p>"Q Who is that Mr. Ocampo, what is his complete name?—</p>
<p>A. Mr. Numeriano Ocampo.</p>
<p>"The Provincial Fiscal is hereby ordered to investigate that man.</p>
<p>"Fiscal:</p>
<p>"I have investigated this case and found out that this Ocampo has nothing to 
do with this case and I found no evidence against this Ocampo.</p>
<p>"Court:</p>
<p>"Sentence reserved."</p></blockquote>
<p>Two days later, or on May 10, 1948, the trial court rendered the following 
judgment:</p>

<p>"This case is called for trial on May 8, 1948. Upon arraignment the accused

<p>"The offense committed by the accused is kidnapping and serious illegal 
detention as defined by Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by 
Section 2 of Republic Act No. 18 and punished by <em>reclusion temporal</em> in 
its minimum period to death. Applying indeterminate sentence law the penalty 
shall be <em>prision mayor</em> in its maximum degree to <em>reclusion 
temporal</em> in the medium degree, as minimum, or ten (10) years and one (1) 
day of <em>prision mayor</em> to twenty (20) years, with the accessory penalties 
for by law, with costs. The accused is entitled to one-half of his preventive 
imprisonment."</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It must be noticed that in the caption of the case as it appears in the 
judgment above quoted, the offense charged is named "SLIGHT ILLEGAL DETENTION" 
while in the body of the judgment it is said that the accused "stands charged 
with the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention." In the information 
filed by the Provincial Fiscal it is said that he "accuses Frisco Holgado of the 
crime of "Slight Illegal Detention." The facts alleged in said information are 
not clear as to whether the offense charged is merely "slight illegal detention" 
as the offense is named therein or the capital offense of "kidnapping and 
serious illegal detention" as found by the trial Judge in his judgment. Since 
the accused-appellant pleaded guilty and no evidence appears to have been 
presented by either party, the trial Judge must have deduced the capital offense 
from the facts pleaded in the information.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, particularly the qualified plea given by the 
accused, who was unaided by counsel, it was not prudent, to say the least, for 
the trial court to render such a serious judgment finding the accused guilty of 
a capital offense, and imposing upon him such a heavy penalty as ten years and 
one day of <em>prision mayor</em> to twenty years, without absolutely any 
evidence to determine and clarify the true facts of the case.</p>
<p>The proceedings in the trial court are irregular from the beginning. It is 
expressly provided in our Rules of Court, Rule 112, sec. 3, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the defendant appears without attorney, he must be informed by the court 
that it is his right to have attorney before being arraigned, and must be asked 
if he desires the aid of attorney. If he desires and is unable to employ 
attorney, the Court must assign attorney <em>de oficio</em> to defend him. A 
reasonable time must be allowed for procuring attorney."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under this provision, when a defendant appears without attorney, the court 
has four important duties to comply with: 1—It must inform the defendant that it 
is his right to have attorney before being arraigned; 2—After giving him such 
information the court must ask him if he desires the aid of an attorney; 3—If he 
desires and is unable to employ attorney, the court must assign attorney <em>de 
oficio</em> to defend him; And 4—If the accused desires to procure an attorney 
of his own the court must grant him a reasonable time therefor.</p>
<p>Not one of these duties had been complied with by the trial court. The record 
discloses that said court did not inform the accused of his right to have an 
attorney nor did it ask him if he desired the aid of one. The trial court failed 
to inquire whether or not the accused was to employ an attorney, to grant him 
reasonable time to procure one or to assign an attorney <em>de oficio</em>. The 
question asked by the Court to the accused was "Do you have an attorney or are 
you going to plead guilty?" Not only did such a question fail to inform the 
accused that it was his right to have an attorney before arraignment, but, what 
is worse, the question was so framed that it could have been construed by the 
accused as a suggestion from the court that he plead guilty if he had no 
attorney. And this is a denial of fair hearing in violation of the due process 
clause contained in our Constitution.</p>
<p>One of the great principles of justice guaranteed by our Constitution is that 
"no person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense without due process of 
law", and that all accused "shall enjoy the right to be heard by himself and 
counsel." In criminal cases there can be no fair hearing unless the accused be 
given an opportunity to be heard by counsel. The right to be heard would be of 
little avail if it does not include the right to be heard by counsel. Even the 
most intelligent or educated man may have no skill in the science of the law, 
particularly in the rules of procedure, and, without counsel, he may be 
convicted not because he is guilty but because he does not know how to establish 
his innocence. And this can happen more easily to persons who are ignorant or 
uneducated. It is for this reason that the right to be assisted by counsel is 
deemed so important that it has become a constitutional right and it is so 
implemented that under our rules of procedure it is not enough for the Court to 
apprise an accused of his right to have an attorney, it is not enough to ask him 
whether he desires the aid of an attorney, but it is essential that the Court 
should assign one <em>de oficio</em> for him if he so desires and he is poor or 
grant him a reasonable time to procure an attorney of his own.</p>
<p>It must be added, in the instant case, that the accused who was unaided by 
counsel pleaded guilty but with the following qualification: "but I was 
instructed by one Mr. Ocampo." The trial court failed to inquire as to the true 
import of this qualification. The record does not show whether the supposed 
instruction was real and whether it had reference to the commission of the 
offense or to the making of the plea of guilty. No investigation was opened by 
the Court on this matter in the presence of the accused and there is now no way 
of determining whether the supposed instruction is a good defense or may vitiate 
the voluntariness of the confession. Apparently the Court became satisfied with 
the fiscal«s information that he had investigated Mr. Ocampo and found that the 
same had nothing to do with this case. Such attitude of the court was wrong for 
the simple reason that a mere statement of the fiscal was not sufficient to 
overcome a qualified plea of the accused. But above all, the court should have 
seen to it that the accused be assisted by counsel specially because of the 
qualified plea given by him and the seriousness of the offense found to be 
capital by the Court.</p>
<p>The Judgment appealed from is reversed and the case is remanded to the court 
below for a new arraignment and a new trial after the accused is apprised of his 
right to have and to be assisted by counsel. It is so ordered.</p>
