</blockquote>
<p>This  case was commenced by a petition filed on November 10, 1950.  The theory of the  petitioners is,  substantially,  as follows: Petitioners Lorenzo,  Guinga,  Rosalia, Adolfo, Saya  and Luisa,  all surnamed Villa Abrille, are descendants  of Francisco Villa Abrille  Lim  Juna—here after referred to as Lim Juna—a Chinese subject  who arrived in Davao, from  China, in  1871  or  187£.  On January 4, 1890, Lim Juna  married  Maria Loreto  Tan Sipo or Sepo—hereafter referred to as Tan Sepo—daughter of Tan Joson (a Chinese)  and  his common law wife,  a Mora, whose name appears nowhere. , Prior thereto, however, Lim Juna and  Tan Sepo  had  already had  extra marital relations, in consequence  of which, Ricardo,  Carlos and  Luisa, all surnamed Villa Abrille, were born on  February 14, 1883,  January 3, 1885 and December 22, 1889, respectively.   During  wedlock, said spouses had  two  (2) children,  namely, Cesareo and Candelaria,  born, respectively, on February 13,1893 and December 2,1895.  Carlos and Cesareo became naturalized citizen's of the Philippines in 1935 and—according to the petition—1916  (before the passage  of  our first naturalization law,  Act No. 2927, approved on March 26, 1920)  or—according to the testimony of Carlos—1925, respectively.  Ricardo Villa Abrille, already deceased, was survived by his children, petitioners Lorenzo,  Guinga, Rosalia, Adolfo and Saya,  all surnamed Villa Abrille.   Saya,  Luisa  and Candelaria  Villa  Abrille are married, respectively,  to Chiu  Eang  Po,  Huang Pit Lin and  Abelardo Tan Chin Hoc, all Chinese subjects.  In the language of the  petition, Lim s Juna "considered  himself as a Spanish subject during the Spanish Regime and had identified  himself  with  the Filipinos,  in all social and civil affairs", as well as  "contributed  to civil  and social  organization during the  Spanish regime and  later during the  period of, American occupation".   After residing continuously in  the Philippines since 1871  or 1872, Lim Juna died therein on March 9, 1943, leaving extensive holdings, among  which were over  800 hectares of  agricultural  lands and more than 30 hectares  of urban lands, situated  in Davao and registered under the Torrens  system. These properties passed by succession  to  his  heirs,  petitioners herein,  who are referred to in the corresponding transfer  certificate of  title—a list of  which  is annexed to the petition—as "Chinese citizens", although they have "considered themselves as  Filipino citizens,"  were "educated  in the public schools' and  "intermingled and associated  with the Filipinos in a proper and irreproachable manner".   We  quote the  prayer  of the  petition:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore, petitioners, Lorenzo, Guinga,  Rosalia, and Adolfo, all  surnamed Villa-Abrille Lim, pray for judgment declaring: them to be Filipino citizens and issue an order directing the  Register of Deeds  of  Davao to change their citizenship status on  the face of the  Transfer Certificates of Title herein before mentioned from Chinese to Filipino citizens;</p>
  <p>"And/or, in the alternative,  petitioners pray  for a declaratory judgment  determining the citizenship status of all the herein named petitioners, with a view of removing all doubt and uncertainty as to their real status; as to petitioners Luisa Villa-Abrille, Candelaria Villa-Abrille Tan, and  Saya  Villa-Abrille Lim, their citizenship from the time of their birth up to the time of their marriage; and as  to petitioners  Lorenzo,  Guinea, Rosalia, and  Adolfo, all surnamed Villa-Abrille  Lim, the citizenship of their father, Ricardo Villa-Abrille Lim, at the time of his birth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  Republic of  the Philippines objected to  the  petition,  upon the ground that petitioners  are  not citizens of the Philippines; that a declaratory judgment is not proper under the allegations of the petition;  and that petitions for "change  of  entry in a Certificate  of Title  should be filed in the G.L.R.O. proceedings of the land in question." </p>
<p>After due hearing, the  Court of First Instance of Davao found  that petitioners  are  citizens of the Philippines, except Luisa, Candelaria  and Saya, who although formerly enjoying such political status have lost it, owing to  their Tnarriage to  Chinese nationals.. Hence, the court issued the order  above referred  to,  dated December  29,  1951, in favor of petitioners Lorenzo, Guinga,  Rosalia and Adolfo, all surnamed Villa  Abrille.</p>
<p>Neither the petition nor the order appealed from cites the legal provision under  which petitioners  apply for an order  directing the Register  of Deeds of  Davao to change their  citizenship status on the face of the Transfer Certificates of Title  herein before mentioned  from Chinese to Filipino citizens," as prayed for in said petition.   However, the language thereof and the tenor of said order insofar as  it directs the aforementioned officer  to amend the certificates of title in question  by stating thereon that Lorenzo, Guinga, Rosalia  and  Adolfo Villa Abrille are Filipinos—suggest,  and  petitioners admit  in their  brief, that  they rely  upon section 112 of Act No.  496, reading:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No  erasure,  alteration,  or  amendment  shall  be  made  upon the registration  book  after the  entry of  a certificate of title or of a memorandum  hereon and the attestation of  the same by the clerk or any register of deeds,  except by order of the court. Any registered owner or other person  in interest may at  any time apply by petition to the court, upon  the  ground that  registered  interests of  any  description,  whether  vested, contingent, expectant, or inchoate, have terminated and  ceased;  or  that new interests have arisen  or  been created which  do not  appear  upon the certificate; or  that any  error,  omission, or mistake  was made in entering a certificate  of  any memorandum thereon, or on  any duplicate  certificate;  or  that  the  name  of  any  person on  the certificate has been  changed;  or  that  the registered owner  has been married; or if registered  as  married, that the marriage has been terminated;  or  that a corporation which owned  registered land and has been dissolved has  not conveyed the  same within three  years after  its dissolution;  or upon any other  reasonable ground;  and  the court shall  have  jurisdiction to hear and  determine the petition after notice to all parties  in interest,  and may order  the entry of a new  certificate, or  grant any other  relief upon such terms and conditions,  requiring security  if  necessary, as  it may  deem  proper:  Provided,  however,  That this  section shall not be construed  to give the court  authority  to  open the original decree of  registration,  and that nothing shall be done or ordered  by the court  which shall impair the title or other interest of a purchaser holding a certificate for value  and in good  faith, or his heirs or assigns, without his or their  written consent.</p>
  <p>"Any   petition filed under this   section  and  all  petitions  and motions  filed  under  the  provisions  of  this Act  after original registration shall  be  filed and entitled in  the original case in which the decree of registration was  entered."   (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner seemingly feels  that  the portion  we  have underscored, referring to case3 of "error,  omission or mistake,"  justifies the order appealed from.  To our mind, however,  it is  clear that, in the case  at bar, they are not entitled  to  the  benefits  of   said  provision,  inasmuch  as: (1) the relief therein  contemplated may be  granted  only "in the original case  in  which the  decree of registration was entered"; (2)  there is no allegation in the  petition, and no  evidence to  the  effect,  that the aforementioned reference, to petitioners  herein as "Chinese" citizens, was due to any "error,  mistake  or  omission";  and  (3)  no evidence whatsoever having been introduced  on how petitioners happened to  be so  referred in  the  certificates  of title, the presumption is that the same had—in all respects, including said reference to petitioners' nationality—been issued in conformity with law, and that no "error, mistake or omission had been committed  in connection therewith. Indeed, considering that petitioners  claim  to  have acquired their propriety rights by inheritance, said transfer certificates  of title  must have been issued in accordance with  a deed of partition, either judicial or extra-judicial, stating that  they  are  Chinese.   This is,  obviously,  one of the main reasons why said section 112 of Act No. 496 provides that all motions or petitions under its provisions "shall be entitled and filed in the original case  in which the decree of registration was entered."   Had petitioners herein adhered to  this mandate,  the G.L.R.O. records of the lands in question would be before the Court and we would now have a  concrete idea of how they came to be described as  Chinese in the transfer  certificates of title above referred to.   Compliance with the  requirement that the petition or motion  for amendment of the certificates of title  shall  be filed  in the  original registration cases is essential, therefore, to the relief provided in  said section  and may not  be  dispensed  with.  Needless to  say, petitioners' omission  from presenting any proof on the specific conditions  under which they happened to be referred to as  Chinese  in said certificates of title,  leads to a  conclusion unfavorable to them.</p>
<p>May we grant "a declaratory judgment determining the citizenship  status of all the herein named petitioners with a view of removing all doubt and uncertainty as to their real  status",  as prayed for in their  petition?   Identical was  the  issue raised  in the case of Hospicio Obiles vs. Republic of  the Philippines (4  Off.  Gaz.,  923),  which was  resolved by this Court, unanimously in  the  negative. We  then said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * upon closer analysis,  especially of the prayer of the petition and the allegation to the effect that he is a Filipino citizen and   is ready  and willing to  submit evidence  to sustain this allegation, what the petitioners desires is to be declared a Filipino citizen  in spite of Ms registration as a Chinese citizen.  As contended  by the Solicitor General, petitioner's remedy is clearly  not by an action for  declaratory relief.</p>
  <p>"For the reason, therefore, that petitioner's action for declaratory relief is not the proper remedy, because his desire is to be declared a Filipino citizen, and because the  facts alleged in his petition constitute no cause for a declaratory judgment, the judgment  appealed, from  should  be, as it  hereby is,  affirmed,  with costs against petitioner-appellant''  (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We  find absolutely no reason to depart  from this view, which is squarely  in point.  What is more, we have no change, in the  matter,  for section 1, of  Rule 66 of  the Rules  of Court says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Any person interested  under  a deed,  will,  contract or other written  instrument, or whose rights  are  affected  by a  statute or ordinance, may  bring an  action  to  determine  any question of construction  or validity  arising under the instrument  or statute and for a declaration of his rights  or duties thereunder"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to  this provision, one cannot secure a declaratory relief except in "an action to determine any question of construction of  validity arising under" an "instrument or statute or for. a determination of his right  or duties thereunder".  Petitioners do not seek a detention of any such question or of their rights or duties under any instrument  or statute.   In short,  the case at  bar is patently beyond  the purview of  said Rule  66  of  the  Rules  of Court:</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the order appealed  from  must  be, as it is hereby reversed,  with  costs against the petitioners.   It is so  ordered.</p>
