				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On&nbsp; November&nbsp; 25, 1953, plaintiff filed an action&nbsp; against defendants&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Cebu to recover&nbsp; the aggregate&nbsp; amount of P4,301.00, plus interest thereon and the&nbsp; costs of&nbsp; action.&nbsp; Basis of the&nbsp; action is<br><br>the claim that the provisions of Section 8, paragraph&nbsp; (ii) and (vv) of Ordinance No. 6 of the City of Dumaguete do not apply to plaintiff and so the collection of said amount as tax is illegal.<br><br>Defendants in answer countered that City Ordinance No. 6 applies to plaintiff and even if it is not, plaintiff is estopped from&nbsp; recovering&nbsp; said&nbsp; amount because it was&nbsp; not paid under protest as required by law. Parties submitted a&nbsp; stipulation of facts plus&nbsp; some documentary&nbsp; evidence and&nbsp; on&nbsp; January&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the court rendered judgment declaring Section 8, paragraph&nbsp; (ii) of Ordinance No.&nbsp; 6&nbsp; of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Dumaguete, as. amended, null and void, and Section 8, paragraph&nbsp; (vv)&nbsp; of the same ordinance,, inapplicable to plaintiff, but holding that plain- tiff cannot ask for refund of the taxes&nbsp; because&nbsp; they were not paid under protest.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; due time, plaintiff&nbsp; appealed but because the only issue raised is one&nbsp; of law, the case was certified&nbsp; to us by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On March, 1917, our government granted to&nbsp; "La Electrica", a <i>sociedad anonima</i>, a franchise&nbsp; to maintain&nbsp; and operate an&nbsp; electric plant for light, heat and power in the Municipality&nbsp; of Dumaguete&nbsp; (now&nbsp; city),&nbsp; Province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Negros Oriental, for a period of fifty (50) years.&nbsp; This franchise was acquired by plaintiff who was given a&nbsp; certificate of public convenience by the&nbsp; Public Service Commission. Under the provisions of Act No. 2791, plaintiff is required to pay quarterly a franchise tax of 2% during a period of thirty&nbsp; (30) years on its gross income.<br><br>On December 14, 1949, the&nbsp; City of Dumaguete enacted Ordinance No. 6, which was amended by Ordinance No. 79, imposing certain license taxes on every operator of an electric plant within&nbsp; the city, and on the strength of its provisions the&nbsp; City of Dumaguete collected the taxes in question.<br><br>The only issue before us is whether the taxes in question were paid&nbsp; under protest, and in the negative, whether the law requires&nbsp; that they be paid under protest&nbsp; before their refund can&nbsp; be demanded by the tax payer.<br><br>With regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; first&nbsp; question, the evidence shows that a portion of the tax was paid under protest while the rest was voluntarily paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; "This appears on the face of the official receipts issued by the City Treasurer when the taxes were paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the portion which&nbsp; was paid under protest, there can therefore be no question with regard to its refund because in the decision appealed from the trial court&nbsp; held that the provisions of the ordinance under which the same was collected are either null or inapplicable to plaintiff.&nbsp; This portion of the decision is now binding upon defendants because of their failure to appeal.<br><br>With regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; second&nbsp; question, plaintiff&nbsp; contends that there is no provision in the&nbsp; Charter&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City of Dumaguete which&nbsp; requires a taxpayer&nbsp; to pay under pro- test to enable him to secure a refund&nbsp; of a municipal tax paid by&nbsp; him under an&nbsp; ordinance&nbsp; approved by said&nbsp; city. This claim has&nbsp; no merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Republic Act No.&nbsp; 327, known as the Charter&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of Dumaguete, lays, down the procedure&nbsp; to be&nbsp; followed relative to the collection of <i>taxes in general</i>.&nbsp; We refer&nbsp; to Section 57 which provides that " (a) The assessment of a&nbsp; tax&nbsp; shall constitute&nbsp; a lawful indebtedness of the taxpayer to the city which&nbsp; may be enforced by a civil action&nbsp; in any court of compentent jurisdiction" and that "(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; No court shall entertain&nbsp; any suit assailing the validity of a <i>tax assessed under this&nbsp; Charter until the taxpayer shall have -paid, under protest, the taxes assessed&nbsp; against him.</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied)<br><br>Note that this section&nbsp; refers to taxes&nbsp; in general and does not limit its scope to real estate taxes even if they come under Article X.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note also that the&nbsp; section&nbsp; refers&nbsp; to a tax <i>assessed under this Charter</i>, which term is all-inclusive. If the intendment of the law is to limit its scope to collections of real estate taxes, it should have mentioned Article X instead&nbsp; of the word&nbsp; "Charter."<br><br>It is true that Section 306 of the National Internal Revenue Code&nbsp; provides that an action for the recovery of any national internal revenue tax may be maintained regardless of&nbsp; whether&nbsp; such tax has. been paid&nbsp; or&nbsp; not under protest, but this provision&nbsp; refers to&nbsp; a national&nbsp; internal&nbsp; revenue tax and not to a tax assessed&nbsp; under a city&nbsp; or&nbsp; municipal ordinance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; requirement&nbsp; concerning the&nbsp; payment of a tax under protest is statutory (Sections 1227&nbsp; and 1298, Cooley on Taxation, Vol. 3,&nbsp; 4th Ed.).<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; modified in the sense that plaintiff&nbsp; may recover the&nbsp; taxes which, according to the records of the City Treasurer of Dumaguete, were paid under protest. In all&nbsp; other&nbsp; respects, the decision&nbsp; is affirmed,&nbsp; without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
