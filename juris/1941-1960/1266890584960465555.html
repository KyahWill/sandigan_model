				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; by Benjamin Celestial and 175&nbsp; others for review of the decision of the Auditor General, dated September 9, 1957,&nbsp; denying their&nbsp; claim for&nbsp; differential pay under the Minimum&nbsp; Wage Law.<br><br>The&nbsp; record&nbsp; discloses&nbsp; that petitioners&nbsp; are&nbsp; employees and/or workers of the Southern&nbsp; Mindanao&nbsp; Experimental Station,&nbsp; later referred to as Experimental Station, Bureau of Plant Industry in Davao City, and that since 1952, they had been paid each a daily wage of P2.50; that some time in March 1957, petitioners filed with the Auditor General's Office their&nbsp; claims for&nbsp; differential pay,&nbsp; alleging&nbsp; among other things that they were entitled to the minimum wage of P4.00 a day,&nbsp; instead of P2.50, which&nbsp; was&nbsp; actually paid them by&nbsp; the Experimental&nbsp; Station;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; as already stated, on September 9,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; the Auditor&nbsp; General rendered a decision, holding that petitioners were not entitled to the minimum daily wage of P4.00, but only to P2.50.<br><br>The resolution of this case depends upon the interpretation and application of Section 3(a),&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; of the Minimum&nbsp; Wage&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; which&nbsp; we&nbsp; reproduce&nbsp; below&nbsp; for purposes of&nbsp; ready reference:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Minimum wage.</span>— (a) Every employer&nbsp; shall&nbsp; pay&nbsp; to each of his employees who is employed by an&nbsp; enterprise other than in agriculture wages at the rate&nbsp; of not less than—<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;(1) * * *<br><br>(2) Three pesos a day on the effective date of this Act and for one&nbsp; year after the effective date,&nbsp; and thereafter P4.00 a day, for employees of establishments&nbsp; located outside of&nbsp; Manila or its environs:&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *.<br></div><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) Every employer who operates a farm enterprise comprising more than&nbsp; 12&nbsp; hectares shall&nbsp; pay each of his employees&nbsp; who is engaged in agriculture, wages at&nbsp; the rate of not less than—<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) ******,<br>(2) ******;<br>(3) One year thereafter, P2.50 a day and no allowances for board and&nbsp; lodging shall reduce this wage below P2.25 in cash. <br></div><br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) Effective on the first&nbsp; of July, nineteen hundred and fifty-two, the minimum wage rates for employees in the Government service shall be those provided in subsections&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; of this section *&nbsp; * *."<br></blockquote>From the legal&nbsp; provisions above-reproduced, it will readily be seen that in order that an employee or laborer may be paid the minimum wage&nbsp; of P2.50 a day, he must be employed by an enterprise (in&nbsp; this case, the Southern Mindanao Experimental Station)&nbsp; engaged in agriculture; that said employer operates a&nbsp; farm&nbsp; comprising more than 12 hectares; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; employee or laborer&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaged in agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second condition is satisfied because the Experimental Station is operating a farm comprising 960 hectares.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; next question&nbsp; to be decided is whether or not said Experimental Station&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; agriculture. To determine this, we have to go back to the functions of the Bureau of Plant Industry&nbsp; (Section 1753, Revised Administrative Code) of which the Experimental Station is an agency&nbsp; or&nbsp; adjunct, said&nbsp; Experimental Station&nbsp; being provided for in Section 1754 of the same&nbsp; Revised Administrative Code. Said two&nbsp; sections are reproduced below for ready reference:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 1753. <span style="font-style: italic;">Functions of Bureau of Plant&nbsp; Industry.</span>—It shall be the function of said Bureau to collect and disseminate useful&nbsp; information pertaining to agriculture in the Philippines, to encourage the use&nbsp; of&nbsp; improved&nbsp; agricultural methods; and, in&nbsp; general,&nbsp; to promote the development of the agricultural resources of the Philippines, as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) By&nbsp; the introduction of new&nbsp; domesticated animals, and the improvement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the breeds&nbsp; of&nbsp; domesticated animals now found in the&nbsp; Philippines;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) By the control and&nbsp; eradication of diseases of live&nbsp; stock;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) By the investigation of soil and climate conditions, and the methods&nbsp; of&nbsp; producing&nbsp; and handling agricultural products;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) By&nbsp; the&nbsp; introduction,&nbsp; production,&nbsp; and&nbsp; distribution of improved seeds&nbsp; and plants;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) By the control and eradication of&nbsp; diseases, insects, and other pests injurious to cultivated plants;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>) By the&nbsp; operation of&nbsp; a system of demonstration and agricultural extension work;<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>) By the collection of agricultural&nbsp; statistics; and<br>(<span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>) By the&nbsp; publication and distribution of bulletins, circulars, and other printed matter."<br></div><br>"Sec. 1754. <i>Experiment stations, farms, and stations for agricultural instruction.</i>—In&nbsp; such&nbsp; places in the&nbsp; Philippines as may&nbsp; be considered suitable for the purpose, the Director of Plant Industry, with the&nbsp; approval of the&nbsp; Head of the Department, shall, as&nbsp; funds shall be available&nbsp; therefore, establish, equip, maintain, and operate experiment stations,&nbsp; farms,&nbsp; stock farms,&nbsp; and stations for practical agricultural instruction.<br><br>"(In the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Agriculture is also&nbsp; vested the&nbsp; supervision and control of&nbsp; American agricultural&nbsp; colonies)."<br></blockquote>On&nbsp; the basis&nbsp; of the legal provisions&nbsp; above-reproduced, we are of the opinion that both the Bureau&nbsp; of Plant Industry and&nbsp; Experimental&nbsp; Station, particularly the latter, are engaged in agriculture&nbsp; or are&nbsp; dedicated&nbsp; to&nbsp; agricultural functions, specially&nbsp; when we&nbsp; take into&nbsp; consideration the definition of&nbsp; agriculture in&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Minimum Wage&nbsp; Law&nbsp; itself,&nbsp; Republic Act No.&nbsp; 602,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is as follows:<br><blockquote>" 'Agriculture' includes farming in all its&nbsp; branches and among other things include the cultivation and tillage of the soil, dairying, the production, cultivation, growing, and harvesting of any agricultural or&nbsp; horticultural commodities, the&nbsp; raising&nbsp; of livestock or poultry, and any practices performed by a farmer or on a&nbsp; farm as an incident&nbsp; to or&nbsp; in conjunction&nbsp; with such farming operations, but does&nbsp; not include&nbsp; the manufacturing or processing of sugar, coconuts,&nbsp; abaca, tobacco, pineapples&nbsp; or other farm&nbsp; products."<br></blockquote>And it is a matter of public knowledge that experimental stations maintained by the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Plant Industry, specially when done on&nbsp; a big scale like the Southern Mindanao Experimental Station that&nbsp; operates&nbsp; a&nbsp; farm comprising 960 hectares, through its employees&nbsp; and laborers, actually till the soil, introduce and plant seeds of the&nbsp; best crop varieties found by it after study and experiment, raise said&nbsp; crops in the&nbsp; best approved methods of cultivation, including the spacing of each plant or seedling&nbsp; and the amount of water needed through irrigation, weeding, etc., and the&nbsp; proper harvesting of the crop,&nbsp; including the timing and method, all for the&nbsp; instruction and benefit of Philippine farmers, and to foster, agriculture in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; Included in this cultivation is&nbsp; the discovery of plant pests and&nbsp; their&nbsp; eradication by&nbsp; means of treatment with the proper insecticides.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter, from the harvest are extracted&nbsp; the seeds which are&nbsp; called certified seeds, for sale and distribution to farmers.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; can be no question that all&nbsp; these&nbsp; acts and functions fall within the definition&nbsp; of agriculture&nbsp; provided in&nbsp; the Minimum&nbsp; Wage Law and,&nbsp; consequently,&nbsp; are agricultural as&nbsp; distinguished from non-agricultural functions.&nbsp; It&nbsp; follows that&nbsp; the laborers and farm workers who actually&nbsp; carry out&nbsp; and perform these functions are also engaged in agriculture.&nbsp; It is possible that&nbsp; not&nbsp; all the laborers and&nbsp; employees in the Experimental Station are actually engaged in preparing the&nbsp; land for planting, such as plowing, tilling,&nbsp; and planting the seeds or seedlings, in weeding the farm,&nbsp; in treating plant diseases and harvesting crops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some employees may be&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; in. office work,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as, clerks, supervisors,&nbsp; maintenance&nbsp; workers, etc.&nbsp; But inasmuch&nbsp; as they are all&nbsp; employed by the Experimental&nbsp; Station, which is a farm enterprise, and&nbsp; their work is incidental to agriculture, they may also be&nbsp; considered as agricultural workers and employees.&nbsp; Interpretative Bulletin No. 14, issued by the United States Wage Administration&nbsp; Service, implementing the provisions of the&nbsp; Fair&nbsp; Labor&nbsp; Standards Act of the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1938,&nbsp; from&nbsp; which our Minimum Wage Law was copied (Morave: Minimum Wage Law,&nbsp; p. 279), under&nbsp; the&nbsp; title "Office Workers, Etc.," says:<br><blockquote><center>"Office&nbsp; Workers, Etc.<br></center><br>"12. We have received inquiries concerning office&nbsp; help—secretaries, clerks,&nbsp; bookkeepers, etc., night watchmen, maintenance&nbsp; workers, engineers, etc., who are employed by a farmer or a&nbsp; farm in connection with the activities described&nbsp; in the definition of 'agriculture' contained in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 3&nbsp; (/).&nbsp; In our&nbsp; opinion such employees&nbsp; are exempt."&nbsp; (Teller:&nbsp; Labor Disputes and Collective&nbsp; Bargaining, Vol. II, p.&nbsp; 1209)</blockquote>The above-reproduced portion&nbsp; of the bulletin,&nbsp; applied&nbsp; in this jurisdiction,&nbsp; means&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; employees&nbsp; mentioned therein are not governed&nbsp; by our Minimum&nbsp; Wage Law,&nbsp; as regards the&nbsp; minimum wage of P4.00 a day for non-agricultural workers; consequently, they may receive&nbsp; only the minimum wage&nbsp; of P2.50&nbsp; a day, prescribed for&nbsp; workers engaged in agriculture.<br><br>But petitioners contend that the Bureau of Plant Industry and the Experimental Station&nbsp; could&nbsp; not be&nbsp; engaged in agriculture for the reason that their farm enterprise is not for profit.&nbsp;&nbsp; In answer to this contention, it is enough to say that&nbsp; Minimum Wage Law in defining agriculture, does not prescribe the condition that the&nbsp; person or entity is engaged in it for purposes of profit.&nbsp; We can well imagine a person interested in research and scientific agriculture who proceeds to cultivate a little farm of, say, one or two hectares,&nbsp; to put into practice the results of his research, introducing in the cultivation the most modern methods, the most suitable fertilizers, etc., so that a hectare so cultivated can produce, say, from 250 to 300 cavans of palay and incidentally to compete for a prize or a medal offered by the Government or any of its&nbsp; agencies.&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; that he does not cultivate the&nbsp; farm for&nbsp; purposes i of profit,&nbsp; but rather in the interest of science and to prove his scientific and&nbsp; agricultural theories,&nbsp; and&nbsp; incidentally enter the contest&nbsp; for&nbsp; a prize,&nbsp; does not&nbsp; make him less agriculturist and&nbsp; his activities&nbsp; as agriculture.<br><br>Incidentally, it may be stated that the Secretary of Justice in an opinion rendered in connection with the different activities of the Davao Regional Fiber Station, holds that the&nbsp; laborers and&nbsp; employees&nbsp; of said fiber&nbsp; experimental station&nbsp; are not entitled to the&nbsp; minimum wage of&nbsp; P4.00.<br><br>In&nbsp; view of the foregoing, the decision&nbsp; appealed from is hereby&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L., Endencia,&nbsp; Barrera,</i>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <i>Gutierrez David,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
