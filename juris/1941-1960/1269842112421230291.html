				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Under date of January 22, 1947, the herein respondents, Natividad Reyes and 
Adriana Reyes, filed a verified complaint (civil case No. 129) in the Court of 
First Instance of Rizal against the herein petitioners, praying that a writ of 
preliminary mandatory injunction be issued ordering the petitioners to restore 
to the respondents the possession of two contiguous lots located in the 
municipality of Pasay, Province of Rizal, and to take away the wire fence built 
around said lots by the petitioners; that after trial said injunction be made 
permanent; that the petitioners be sentenced to pay P20,000 by way of damages, 
and that the respondents be granted such other remedy as may be proper under the 
law. The complaint alleges in substance that the respondents acquired the two 
lots on June 6, 1945, from their former owner, Realty Investments, Inc.; that 
from such date the respondents have been in possession of the lots; that in 
December, 1946, the latter began constructing on the lots four houses of strong 
materials valued at about P14,000; that on January 7, 1947, when the houses were 
about to be finished, the petitioners forcibly entered the lots and ousted 
therefrom the respondents and the persons constructing the house; that said 
petitioners thereafter built around the lots a wire fence and posted armed men 
on the lots with a view to preventing the respondents and their laborers from 
entering therein and proceeding with the construction of the houses above 
mentioned.
<p>Under date of February 1, 1947, the petitioners filed a verified answer in 
said civil case No. 129, alleging in the main that the contract of June 6, 1945, 
between the Realty Investments, Inc., and the respondents, upon which the latter 
base their claim of ownership over the lots in question, was a mere contract to 
sell, which was converted on April 26, 1946, into a conditional contract to buy, 
which was in turn rescinded on December 19, 1946, by the Realty Investments, 
Inc.; that the petitioners are the registered owners of the lots, having bought 
the same from the Realty Investments, Inc., on December 28, 1946; that the 
petitioners have been in peaceful possession thereof, by themselves and through 
their predecessor in interest, Parsram Aildos (who transferred to the 
petitioners his right to buy the lots from the Realty Investments, Inc.), since 
November, 1941; that the respondents, on or about December 28, 1946, over the 
opposition of the petitioners and their predecessor in interest, entered the 
lots and began the construction of the four houses mentioned in the complaint; 
that it was the mayor of Pasay who ordered the suspension of said construction, 
and that the persons guarding the premises are members of the Detective and 
Protective Bureau, Inc., who are merely enforcing the order of said mayor.</p>
<p>Under date of February 1, 1947, the petitioners filed a verified written 
opposition to the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, 
based on practically the same allegations contained in their answer.</p>
<p>After a hearing in which the matter was argued at length, the herein 
respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Honorable Ambrosio 
Santos, issued an order dated March 14, 1947, directing the issuance of the writ 
of preliminary mandatory injunction prayed for by the respondents, upon their 
filing of a bond in the sum of P5,000. Petitioners' motion for reconsideration 
dated March 28, 1946, was denied by the respondent judge in his order of April 
15, 1947. On this latter date, the respondent judge issued an order approving 
the bond of P5,000 filed by the respondents and directing the issuance of the 
corresponding writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.</p>
<p>Whereupon, on April 19, 1947, the petitioners instituted the present petition 
for certiorari with preliminary injunction, praying that the orders of the 
respondent judge of March 14 and April 15, 1947, be annulled and that the 
respondent judge be ordered to set civil case No. 129 for trial on the merits 
with a view to determining the question of title and possession over the two 
lots in question.</p>
<p>The respondent judge, without attempting to settle the issue relating to the 
ownership of the lots, found, in his order of March 14, 1947, that the 
respondents have been in material and physical possession of the lots until 
January 7, 1947, and that in December, 1946, said respondents commenced to build 
four houses of strong materials on said lots and the construction work was 
suspended only on January 7, 1947, due to the forcible entry of the petitioners 
who thereafter built around the lots a wire fence and placed armed men on the 
premises to make the ouster of the respondents and their laborers effective. 
After a careful examination of the record before us, we find said conclusions to 
be correct. It is significant that the petitioners admit the existence of a 
contract in favor of the respondents for the purchase of the lots in question, 
and that said contract preceded the alleged deeds of sale executed by the Realty 
Investments, Inc., on December 28, 1946, in favor of the petitioners. More 
significant still is the stubborn fact that there are actually on the lots four 
houses of strong materials about to be finished, the construction of which by 
the respondents in December, 1946, is not denied by the petitioners. These 
circumstances strongly militate against petitioners' pretense that they had ever 
been in peaceful possession of the lots prior to that of the herein 
respondents.</p>
<p>The legal question that, arises is whether the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary mandatory injunction, such as that ordered by the respondent judge, 
is proper, in view of the established rule that injunction generally will not be 
granted to take property out of the possession or control of one party and place 
it into that of another whose title has not clearly been established by law. 
(Rodulfa <i>vs</i>. Alfonso, 76 Phil., 225, citing earlier cases.)</p>
<p>We are of the opinion that the respondent judge did not gravely abuse his 
discretion in granting the injunction. We hereby reiterate the general rule 
pointed out in Rodulfa <i>vs</i>. Alfonso, <i>supra</i>, but we consider the 
case at bar as not falling thereunder. Rather, it is a situation contemplated in 
the following passages of said decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But the fact that the petitioner might have been in sporadic possession of 
all or some of the lands in question, in the last months of 1945, having entered 
the same, by means of threats and intimidation, will not prevent the issuance of 
a writ of preliminary injunction in favor of herein respondent, as defendant in 
said civil case No. 8930, in whose name said lands had been registered under the 
Torrens System, and who has been in possession thereof, during the last 20 
years, as said possession of the petitioner is completely and absolutely 
illegal.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"The sole object of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the <i>status 
quo</i> until the merits can be heard. The <i>status quo</i> is the last actual 
peaceable uncontested <i>status</i> which preceded the pending controversy. 
(Frederick <i>vs</i>. Huber, 180 Pa., 572, 37 Atl., 90.)</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"In cases involving the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, the 
exercise of sound judicial discretion by the lower court will not generally be 
interfered with; and the refusal of the trial court to permit the plaintiff in 
this case to file a counterbond cannot be considered as an abuse of sound 
judicial consideration, bearing in mind particularly the admission made by the 
plaintiff himself that sometime in 1945, or thereabouts, he occupied and took 
possession of all or some of the lands in question, without waiting for the 
final decision of the competent courts in said civil case No. 8930. It is a 
general principle in equity jurisprudence that 'he who comes to equity must come 
with clean hands.' (North Negros Sugar Co. <i>vs</i>. Hidalgo, 63 Phil., 664.)" 
(Rodulfa <i>vs</i>. Alfonso, <i>supra</i>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The action of the petitioners in encircling the lots in question with a wire 
fence and in guarding the place, may at most be considered as a mere 
interference with or disturbance of respondents' possession and, as such, is 
even of less extent than the possession admittedly held by the petitioners in 
the case of Rodulfa <i>vs</i>. Alfonso, <i>supra</i>. We have therefore a much 
better instance in which a preliminary injunction may be availed of "to preserve 
the <i>status quo</i> until the merits can be heard." Said <i>status quo</i> is 
the "last actual peaceable and uncontested" possession of the herein respondents 
which preceded civil case No. 129, and certainly not the guarded possession of 
the petitioners. The necessity of restoring the parties in this case to their 
former situation is called for by the fact that the suspension of the 
construction of respondents' houses may result in a much greater damage than the 
granting of the injunction upon the filing of a bond which can amply indemnify 
the herein petitioners.</p>
<p>The injunction was granted by the respondent judge almost two months after 
the filing of the complaint, and only after the parties had argued the point in 
open court and after considering the verified pleadings with their supporting 
papers. Again, the petitioners were able to file a motion for reconsideration, 
which was also denied by the respondent judge after taking into account all the 
considerations invoked by the petitioners. We are thus unable to hold that the 
respondent judge acted hastily in the matter and without a hearing. Of course, 
it was not yet necessary for the respondent judge to require and receive such 
evidence as may be sufficient to settle the question of title, which should be 
decided after the trial on the merits. It is needless to state in this 
connection that the complaint in civil case No. 129 clearly makes out an action 
to quiet title.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is hereby dismissed with costs against the 
petitioners. So ordered.</p>
<p><i>Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</i> and 
<i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
<p>MORAN, <i>C.J.</i>:</p>I concur in the result.</div>
