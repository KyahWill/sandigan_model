				<H3>COMPAÑIA MARITIMA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND LIBBY, MCNEILL & LIBBY (PHIL.) INC., RESPONDENTS.

<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner Compañia Maritima appeals by certiorari from the decision Of
the Court of Appeals, ordering it to pay respondent Libby, McNeil &amp;
Libby (Phil.), Inc. the sum of P4,070.95, plus legal interest from June
23, 1955 until full payment, and 20 per cent of said sum, as attorney's
fees.
  <p> The contentions of appellant are: (1) the action is
already barred by the Statute of Limitations; and (2) that respondent
corporation is not entitled to interest and attorney's fees.</p>
  <p>
The Court of Appeals, after analyzing the evidence presented by the
parties, found as satisfactorily established—and we are bound by this
finding—that before the war, respondent Libby &amp; Co. (for short) had
been furnishing and selling different foodstuff to petitioner Compañia
Maritima for the consumption of the crews and passengers of the
latter's vessels, payable within 30 days from date of delivery, after
which period, the unpaid amount would carry an interest of 12 per cent
per annum "unless otherwise arranged", and that in case of litigation,
an additional 20 per cent of the unpaid price would be paid as
attorney's fees; that on account of such deliveries, Compañia Maritima
still owed a balance of P4,070.95, for which judgment was rendered in
favor of respondent Libby &amp; Co., as stated in the beginning of this
opinion.</p>
  <p> Petitioner's contention is that, since respondent's
cause of action accrued on November 30, 1951, according to the terms of
the agreement as evidenced by the invoices and vouchers covering the
goods delivered, and the complaint was filed only on June 23, 1955, the
action had already prescribed. However, we have already held<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
that the Moratorium Law tolled or suspended the running of the Statute
of Limitation from March 10, 1945 (when said law took effect) to July
26, 1948 (date of effectivity of Rep. Act No. 342, which lifted the
moratorium, except as to debtors who had filed war damage claims), or 3
years, 4 months, and 16 days. Since petitioner had filed war damage
claims (See Exh. V), the moratorium was not lifted as to him, pursuant
to the cited Act it continued even after the aforementioned date (July
26, 1948) to May 18, 1953, when the Moratorium Law (Rep. Act No. 342)
was declared unconstitutional by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
or 4 years, 9 months and 22 days. Summing up, the result is 8 years, 2
months, and 8 days, which period, is deductible from the period that
elapsed from November 30, 1941 (date of accrual of respondent's action)
to June 23, 1955 (date of filing of said action), which is 13 years, 6
months, and 23 days. The remainder is 5 years, 4 months, and 15 days.
Respondent's action based upon its signed invoices, therefore, is well
within the 10-year prescriptive period, and has not been barred.</p>
  <p>
On the question of interest and attorney's fees, petitioner simply
submits that in view of the "undisputed fact that all the records of
defendant were destroyed during the fight for the liberation of Manila"
which made it impossible for the defendant to verify whether or not it
was really obligated to pay respondent Libby &amp; Co. any amount, it
would not be "equitable nor just that petitioner should be penalized by
sentencing it to pay legal interest and attorney's fees." However much
appellant is entitled to sympathy, still this Court can not disregard
the express contract of the parties providing for the payment of the
sums which do not appear excessive or unconscionable.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, finding no reversible  error  in the decision of the Court of Appeals,  the same  is hereby affirmed <em>in toto</em>,  with  costs  against  the  petitioner-appellant.  So ordered.</p>
