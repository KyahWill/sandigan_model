				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On February 2, 1948, intestate proceedings were  commenced in the Court of First Instance of La Union covering the estate of the deceased Isabel V. Florendo (special proceedings No. 124).  The petition was filed by Atty. Alfredo C. Florendo, as counsel  for  all the heirs, including Angel F. Alafriz and Pedro F. Alafriz,  petitioners  herein.  On November 21,  1950, Atty. Dominador Alafriz  addressed a letter to the clerk of court,  inquiring about the status of the special proceedings and the name of  the administrator and  amount of his bond, and stating  that said  inquiry was  made for  his clients, the petitioners.  In July, 1952, Atty. Dominador  Alafriz addressed another letter to the clerk of court, requesting that no motion or pleading filed by any party be entertained or acted upon without proof of service upon Atty. Alafriz as  counsel for petitioners, and  that  he be furnished with copies  of all orders from the date  of his appearance on  November 21, 1950.  On July 23, 1952, the clerk  of  court  informed Atty.  Alafriz that Atty, Alfredo C. Florendo, since the  commencement of the proceedings,  had  appeared  as counsel for all the heirs including the petitioners; that in the extra-judicial settlement entered into by the parties concerned, including the petitioners, all the heirs were again represented by Atty. Florendo;  that when  a party  is represented by two attorneys,  official notice is always sent to only one of the attorneys, and that notices  in  special proceedings No. 124 were therefore sent to Atty. Florendo in representation  of all the  heirs, including the petitioners.  Upon discovering that on December 16,  1951, a motion to  dismiss was  filed by Atty.  Florendo,  based on  the ground  that all the  heirs  had executed  an  extra-judicial settlement, and that  on January  15, 1952, the court rendered a decision approving said settlement, instead  of dismissing the proceedings,  Atty. Dominador Alafriz  addressed a letter to the clerk of  court, requesting that he be  furnished with a copy  of the  extra-judicial settlement  and of the order with reference thereto,  which  copies  were  actually received by Atty. Alafriz in September,  1952.   On August 20, 1952, Atty. Constante Ayson, in representation of the petitioners and Sofia Chanliecco, filed a motion to set aside the extra-judicial settlement  and the decision of January 15, 1952, on the ground that said  settlement is null and void.  This motion  was denied  on  January  13,  1954, on file  ground  that  petitioners' remedy should  have  been appeal  or a  separate action for  annulment.  A subsequent motion for  reconsideration having been  denied, the petitioners instituted in this Court the present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>The main criticisms  advanced by the  petitioners  are directed against the lack of timely  notice to attorney for petitioners  of the extra-judicial settlement  and of  the order  of the respondent  judge approving the same;  to the nullity of said settlement for lack of authority on the part of Atty. Florendo to sign said settlement for all the heirs, and because of lesion  by more than one-fourth  of the value of petitioners'  legal  share  in  the inheritance from the deceased Isabel  V.  Florendo.</p>
<p>In answer to petitioners' observations,  the respondents call attention to the facts that Atty. Alfredo C.  Florendo represented all the heirs including the petitioners, and therefore had the right  to be served with  and receive all court notices; that Atty. Florendo upon whom said notices were served, in turn  notified all the heirs; that the best evidence that the petitioners were notified of the decision in question is the circumstances that they had already received their portions  in the  inheritance and petitioner Angel  F. Alafriz had as a  matter of fact, disposed of part of his share; and that the motion to set  aside was filed out  of time, more than six months from January 15, 1952 having expired.</p>
<p>The petitioners have  cited  the case  of  Samaniada vs. Mata, et al., 49 Off. Gaz., No. 1, January, 1953, wherein it was held  that  a judgment is merely an  interlocutory order if  something has yet to be done, and a petition for relief is on time when filed before a compromise agreement is  consummated.   This citation is not controlling,  since in  the present case, according to respondents answer, the extra-judicial settlement in question had been consummated, the petitioners  having received their respective shares in the inheritance, and petitioner  Angel  F.  Alafriz  having already disposed of a part of his share and the  sale having been witnessed, among  others, by petitioner Pedro F. Alafriz.   Moreover, in the case invoked by the  petitioners, it was held: "In arriving at the above conclusion, we have taken into account the fact that the petitioner  in the case at bar had two alternative remedies against the compromise approved by the court.   He could file the petition for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, or file a new action to annul the Agreement  within the  period  established by the statute of  limitations.   Even  if his present remedy is barred, this  would not prevent  him from filing a new action to  declare the  contract void, in accordance  with the provisions of the new Civil Code."   (<em>Supra</em>, p. 86.)</p>
<p>Even assuming, therefore, that the grounds of fraud and lesion set forth by the petitioners for contending that the extra-judicial settlement is invalid, are tenable, the proper remedy would be an action to annul  (Quion, et  al. <em>vs.</em> Claridad, et al., 74 Phil., 100).</p>
<p>Having concluded that the decision of January 15, 1952, approving the extra-judicial  settlement  had  become  final because the partition had been consummated, the motion to set aside filed by the petitioners on August 20,  1952, or more than six months after said decision was entered, was out of time.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition is hereby denied,  without prejudice to the filing of the proper action for annulment by the petitioners if desired.  So ordered without costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,  Concepcion, Reyes,  J. B. L., </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
