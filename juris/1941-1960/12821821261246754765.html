<p>After robbing Emma, one of the two robbers took her to a secluded place, a 
vacant lot south of the street, and then and there hugged her, kissed her on the 
mouth, laid her down face upward on a log, and after pulling down her drawers 
placed himself on top of her with intent to satisfy his lust. In the meantime 
the other robber was holding Marcelino Lontok, Jr., at the point of a pistol at 
a distance of about eight meters from the place where Emma was being ravished. 
Emma cried for help, saying, "Junior, pity me!" But Marcelino Lontok, Jr., was 
threatened by his captor with bodily harm if he should move to help her. The 
satyr did not succeed in raping his victim because she valiantly resisted and in 
the course of the struggle both of them fell on the mire beside the log. At that 
precise moment the other robber left Marcelino and approached his companion, 
telling him to stop and inviting him to leave the place. Marcelino escaped to 
seek help. At a distance of about 15 meters he heard two shots. When later in 
the same evening he returned to the place with a police patrol, they found Emma 
dead, her chest and abdomen pierced by two bullets. Two empty shells were found 
at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>The Detective Bureau of the Manila Police Department mobilized its forces to 
discover the authors of the crime. They got the first tangible clue on the 
morning of June 10 when Detective Leano and Marcelino Lontok, Jr., recovered the 
latter's Bulova wrist watch from a peddler who was offering it for sale in front 
of the Ideal Theater on Rizal Avenue. The peddler, a colored American named 
Samuel Rhones, said that he had received the watch from one Jacinto Cornel, 
alias Wy Teng Seng, to sell. Jacinto Cornel told the detective that he had 
received the watch from one Salvador Custodio. The latter in turn said that he 
had bought it from a man called Big Boy, who turned out to be Brigido Carlos. 
Brigido Carlos said that the watch had been given to him in payment of a debt by 
a man whom he knew by the name of Visaya and who had a stall at the foot of 
Quezon Bridge. Visaya's real name turned out to be Saturnino Macawile. The 
latter at first denied having had anything to do with the watch, but after 
further investigation he admitted having delivered it to Brigido Carlos, alias 
Big Boy. At first he said he had bought the watch from a small boy about three 
years old; but after further questioning he said he had bought it from a fellow 
with tattoos on both arms, on the chest, and on the legs. Finally he revealed 
the identity of the mysterious seller as one known by the name of Romy. In view 
of his possession of the stolen watch, and because of his evasive answers as to 
its origin, Saturnino Macawile was suspected as one of the robbers. Indeed 
Marcelino Lontok, Jr., thought so at first. An information was therefore filed 
against Saturnino Macawile and John Doe on June 14, 1947, for the crime in 
question.</p>
<p>Subsequently, however, the detectives succeeded in establishing the identity 
of Romy as that of an ex-convict whose real name was Alejandro Carillo, alias 
Romy alias Iwahig. They went to the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa, where they 
found his prison records and his photograph. His records show that he was 
convicted of robbery in an inhabited house in criminal case No. 63494 of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila, sentenced to 4 months and 1 day of 
imprisonment as minimum and 2 years, 4 months, and 1 day as maximum, and 
commenced to serve his sentence on June 27, 1941. On January 4, 1942, he was 
released on conditional pardon. In August, 1942, he was again convicted of 
robbery in an inhabited house in criminal case No. 511 and sentenced to 6 
months' imprisonment as minimum and 2 years, 11 months, and 10 days as maximum, 
plus subsidiary imprisonment. He was also made to serve the unserved portion of 
his first sentence, he having violated the condition of his pardon. He was 
released from prison upon the expiration of his sentence on August 30, 1946. 
(Exhibit G.)</p>
<p>After thus ascertaining the identity of Romy, the detectives' next task was 
to find and arrest him. They discovered that he left Manila on a boat bound for 
Tacloban, Leyte, on June 8, 1947. Three detectives were dispatched to Tacloban, 
where they found and arrested Alejandro Carillo in the public market on June 23, 
1947. He was at first brought to the police station of Tacloban, where he 
admitted verbally that he was the one who shot Emma Foronda-Abaya.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of June 24, 1947, Alejandro Garillo was interrogated by 
Detective D. Lapina in the presence of Detective L.O. Garcia in the office of 
the Manila Detective Bureau, the questions propounded to him in Tagalog and his 
answers having been reduced to writing by Stenographer D. B. Ferrer. He gave his 
name and personal circumstances as follows: Alejandro Carillo y Almadin, 23 
years old, single, a native of Tacloban, Leyte, painter, and a resident of 
Magallanes Avenue, Tacloban, Leyte. He declared that he resided first at 1472 
Calavite, La Loma, Rizal, up to 1943 and then at 13 Esperanza, Quiapo, Manila; 
that he left Manila for Tacloban on June 4, 1947, because he happened to commit 
a crime. Answering further questions, he revealed that on the evening of June 4, 
1947, about 8:30, he shot a woman on Aurora Avenue. We quote from his answers 
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On June 4, 1947, I was at 1472 Calavite at 5 p. m. Frank and I drank gin. At 
8 p. m. we went out and walked on Aurora Avenue. While we were walking we met 
two persons, a woman and a man. We held them up and took them to a dark place. I 
took the watch of the man. After that I took hold of the woman and took off her 
drawers. The woman screamed. I pulled her to a muddy place. The woman pushed me. 
I also pushed her and then fired two shots at her. Afterwards Frank and I left 
and we separated. I slept at the Blue Dahlia Hotel. Four days after the woman 
had been killed, I went to Leyte to the house of my sister on Magallanes 
Avenue."</p></blockquote>
<p>He said he had known Frank since May 2, 1947; that Frank did not tell him his 
full name but that Frank told him that he lived on San Juan street, Pasay, 
Rizal, and that he was a private detective; that on the night in question he was 
carrying a 45-caliber pistol and Frank, a Japanese Luger. He gave further 
details of the commission of the crime as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I took the watch of the man and Frank took the watch of the woman; I told 
Frank to watch the man. I approached the woman, and when I saw that she was 
pretty I intended to have carnal knowledge of her; so I took her to a yard and 
laid her on a log under banana trees. I kissed her on the mouth, pulled down her 
drawers, grasped her breasts and laid her on the log. She screamed and 
struggled, so we fell into the mud. When I got up, my feet sank into the mud; I 
got sore and took my pistol and shot her twice."</p></blockquote>
<p>He further revealed that when the woman screamed, she called "Junior" in a 
loud voice; that he sold the man's watch for P11 to Nonoy Macawile, whom he 
identified then and there as the accused Saturnino Macawile, and who according 
to him was his housemate at 13 Esperanza, Quiapo; that he sold the watch to 
Macawile near the Quezon Bridge in Quiapo the day after the crime; that Macawile 
had been his housemate for about two years; that Macawile knew him by the name 
of Romy only; that Macawile did not know that the watch had been stolen from the 
man he and Frank held up; that he learned from the newspapers that the victims 
of the robbery he committed on June 4 were Emma and Lontok. He was shown the 
Bulova watch Exhibit D, and he identified it as the same watch he had taken from 
Lontok. He ratified that when he was arrested on June 23 in Tacloban he admitted 
before the local chief of police that he was the one who had shot Emma 
Foronda-Abaya. He also revealed that when he was seven years old he was confined 
in the Welfareville Training School for theft, and that in 1939 and 1941 he was 
sentenced and incarcerated in Muntinlupa for robbery. After his declaration was 
put in writing, he signed it and then ratified it under oath before Assistant 
City Fiscal Julio Villamor. (Exhibit H.)</p>
<p>The detectives ascertained the identity of Frank mentioned by Alejandro 
Carillo to be Toribio Raquenio, who was apprehended on the night of June 25, 
1947, and who on the evening of June 25, 1947, was subjected to interrogatories 
by Detective Tomas A. Calazan of the Manila Detective Bureau in the presence of 
Detective J. Senen. He gave his name and personal circumstances as Toribio 
Raquenio y Pitas, <em>alias</em> Torin <em>alias</em> Frank, 37 years of age, 
single, jobless, native of Cabugao, Ilocos Sur, and residing at 55 Main street, 
Sampaloc, Manila. The following is an excerpt from his answers to the 
interrogatories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am a graduate of the public grammar school (seventh grade graduate) at 
Stockton, California, in the year 1932. At the age of eighteen I went there to 
work and engaged in cutting asparagus and lettuce in Salinas and Stockton, 
California, earning $7 a day. In July, 1946, desirous of seeing my parents and 
relatives, I returned to the Philippines on the s.s. <em>Marine Lanes</em>, 
paying P400 for my fare. After staying a few months in my home province, I came 
to Manila and stayed in the house of my uncle Jesus Acosta at 73 Nacar, San 
Andres, Manila. I left the house of my uncle on the 1st day of June, 1947, and 
went to reside at 55 Main street, Sampaloc, Manila, up to the time of my present 
arrest. I have been jobless since I arrived in Manila. In May I happened to meet 
one James Lavalle at the Cosmos Restaurant on the corner of Azcarraga and Rizal 
Avenue and he invited me to live with him in his house at 55 Main street, 
Sampaloc, after learning that I was looking for a house to live in. A week later 
I became acquainted with one Romy while I was at the Star Restaurant on 
Azcarraga street. Since then I have met him several times: once at the Central 
Hotel, corner of Azcarraga and Rizal Avenue, and later in the house of Simeon 
Madayag at 1472 Calavite, La Loma; then at the Cosmos Restaurant and again in 
the house of Simeon Madayag; then in the Aroma Cafe near the corner of Rizal 
Avenue and Azcarraga. The last meeting was on the afternoon of June 4, 1947. 
Romy invited me to drink beer and gin at the Star Restaurant after I had met him 
at the Aroma Cafe. About 6 p.m. of that day, June 4, 1947, we proceeded to the 
house of Simeon Madayag on Calavite street, and there Romy ordered again for 
Alcoholic drinks, and we drank in the house in the presence of an old woman. 
After drinking, Romy invited me to a walk after showing me his 45-caliber pistol 
stuck at his belly. Knowing him to be armed, I looked for the 38-caliber 
Japanese Luger which Madayag used to hide underneath the piles of their clothes 
inside their unlocked dresser. Fortunately I found the said firearm, so I took 
it without the knowledge of its owner, Simeon Madayag. I became acquainted with 
Simeon Madayag thru my uncle. I learned that Simeon Madayag was the chief of 
police of Munoz, Nueva Ecija, from his sister-in-law Viring. Romy and I boarded 
a bus in La Loma, heading for Santa Cruz, Manila, and upon reaching the 
crossroads near the Chinese Hospital, we alighted and walked northward on Aurora 
Avenue. While walking Romy told me that we were going to hold up any passers-by 
and not long afterwards he was in pursuit of two persons, one a girl and the 
other a man. He held them at the point of his pistol upon reaching a street 
corner. I then walked towards them and held the man at the point of my gun and 
took his wrist watch which I put inside the left breast pocket of my polo shirt. 
I continued holding the man while my companion Romy held up the girl at the 
point of his pistol. They passed alongside us heading southward until they (Romy 
and the girl) reached the log lying on one side of the street. I did not notice 
what they were doing as I kept holding my man, the companion of the girl. We 
were at a distance of about five meters from them. I then heard the girl 
screaming, so I told Romy, "That is enough; pity her." I noticed then that my 
man was moving away. I did not stop my man from going away taut instead 
approached Romy, whose victim was calling for "Junior," her companion. I told 
Romy to stop and leave the place. While I was about ten meters away from them 
(from Romy and the girl) I again heard the suppressed cry of the girl and 
simultaneously I heard two successive shots fired from the direction of Romy and 
the girl. I continued my pace in haste southward while I noticed that Romy was 
following me. Upon reaching the street corner which I found this morning to be 
that of Oroquieta and Bulacan, we separated from each other, Romy heading 
towards Rizal Avenue while I went to La Loma and returned the .38 caliber 
Japanese Luger to Simeon Madayag. Madayag was surprised to know that I took his 
firearm and he asked me for an explanation. I told him that I was drunk, not 
even telling him about the crime Romy and I committed on that particular night. 
Afterwards I left for my home in Sampaloc. The wrist watch which I forcibly took 
from the man was given by me to Romy on that same night of our robbery, while we 
were about to separate at the corner of Bulacan and Oroquieta streets. I do not 
remember whether I have taken some other articles from our victims, as I was 
drunk at that time. I did not tell anybody about the crime I committed with Romy 
on that night of June 4 because I was afraid of the relatives of the victims and 
of the police. I met Romy again yesterday morning, June 28, when I was made to 
confront him in that office of the other building (pointing to the office of 
Captain Tenorio in the Bilibid Compound). There he is (pointing to Alejandro 
Carillo y Almadin, <em>alias</em> Romy <em>alias</em> Romeo Reynaldo 
<em>alias</em> Amado Vergel). Although the place was dark at that time, I was 
able to recognize the man whom I held up at the point of my gun on account of 
his proximity to me. There is the man (pointing to Marcelino Lontok, Jr.). I 
could hardly recognize the girl because she was led away by Romy, but the memory 
of her features is still fresh in my mind, specially when she was in a reclining 
position on the log while Romy was stooping over her. (Exhibit 
E.)</p></blockquote>
<p>On the afternoon of June 29, 1947, Alejandro Carillo was further interrogated 
by Detective J. P. Senen in the presence of Detective T. Calazan, and he then 
and there pointed to and identified Toribio Raquenio as the same man whom he 
knew as Frank, "who was my companion when we held up a couple at the corner of 
Pampanga and Oroquieta on June 4, 1947." The following is an excerpt from his 
answers to the questions propounded by Detective Senen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gun I used in the holdup was left by me in the possession of Simeon 
Madayag of 1472 Calavite, La Loma, Quezon City. I left it with him on June 7, 
1947, before I left Manila for Leyte. That gun is mine. I bought it from a 
friend of mine who is already dead. It is a .45 caliber Colt pistol. I left it 
with Madayag because he is the only one I trust to take care of it. Aside from 
that, I had to leave it with him because I was afraid I would be searched on the 
boat when I went home to Leyte. I have known Madayag since April, 1947, the same 
day I became acquainted with Frank. The only article I took from my victims was 
the watch of the girl (Emma), but I think I dropped it when she resisted when I 
tried to rape her. The watch of Lontok came to my possession because Frank gave 
it to me. I do not know where the other articles taken from our victims are now. 
As far as I know, the gun used by Frank during the holdup was his, but I do not 
know where he got it. I do not know where Madayag is now. As to my educational 
attainment, I finished the sixth grade. (Exhibit F.)</p></blockquote>
<p>After Alejandro Carillo and Toribio Raquenio had confessed as above narrated, 
and as part of the investigation, they were taken by the detectives on June 29, 
1947, together with Marcelino Lontok, Jr., to the scene of the crime, which was 
ascertained to be the corner of Pampanga and Oroquieta streets. Then and there 
they re-enacted the crime with a policewoman impersonating Emma. Photographs of 
the re-enactment were taken and introduced in evidence during the trial. 
(Exhibits B-8, B-9, and B-10.)</p>
<p>After apprehending and investigating Alejandro Carillo and Toribio Raquenio 
the fiscal, on July 1, 1947, amended the information in this case by dropping 
John Doe and charging Alejandro Carillo and Toribio Raquenio as principals of 
the crime of robbery with homicide and with attempted rape and Saturnino 
Macawile as accessory after the fact.</p>
<p>Simeon Madayag, of 1472 Calavite, La Loma, Quezon City, mentioned by 
Alejandro Carillo and Toribio Raquenio in their confessions, turned out to be a 
secret agent of the Department of the Interior, when he went to that Department 
on July 1, 1947, to surrender, according to him, the .45 caliber pistol which he 
said had been left with his wife by Alejandro Carillo, he was informed that the 
Manila Detective Bureau wanted him for investigation. He was immediately taken 
thereto and asked whether the pistol in question was really in his possession. 
He answered in the affirmative and then and there surrendered it to Detectives 
Calazan and Senen.</p>
<p>Said pistol (Exhibit I) and the two empty shells found at the scene of the 
crime (Exhibits J and J-1) were delivered to the National Bureau of 
Investigation for test and examination by Ballistics Expert Edgar Bond of that 
bureau to determine whether the said pistol was the same gun from which the two 
shells had been fired. Mr. Edgar Bond fired three shots from the pistol Exhibit 
I in order to obtain therefrom the test shells Exhibits K, K-1, and K-2. He then 
examined the two sets of shells under a comparison microscope and found from the 
congruent lines thereof that the two shells Exhibits J and J-1 had been fired 
from the pistol Exhibit I. The congruences of the two sots of shells are 
graphically shown in Exhibits L, L-1, and L-2, entitled "Ballistics 
Microphographic Chart," prepared by Ballistics Expert Edgar Bond and explained 
by him during the trial. He also made a written report (Exhibit M) on the result 
of his ballistics examination, wherein he established the conclusion that the 
two shells Exhibits J and J-1 were fired from the pistol Exhibit I. </p>
<p>Marcelino Lontok, Jr., one of the offended parties, testified during the 
trial to the facts set forth in the first two paragraphs of this decision. He 
also identified the two appellants Alejandro Carillo and Toribio Raquenio as the 
robbers, saying that it was a moonlit night and that he was able to see their 
features. He admitted on cross-examination that at first he pointed to the 
original defendant Saturnino Macawile (in lieu of Alejandro Carillo), but 
explained: "As you will see from these two accused, there is semblance between 
the two, specially when Carillon hair was still long and not cropped." He 
further testified that of the articles taken from him on the night in question 
he had been able to recover the watch (Exhibit D) in the manner and under the 
circumstances narrated in the third paragraph of this decision. He said that he 
was sure that it was the same watch that had been stolen from him because "just 
below the secondary dial, on the face of the watch, there is a small crack on 
the glass," and "in the spring balance on the back there are some 
scratches."</p>
<p>Simeon Madayag, of 1472 Calavite, La Loma, Quezon City, testified during the 
trial in substance as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know Alejandro Carillo because he used to go to my house once in a while 
in May and June, 1947. He wanted to court my sister-in-law. I know also Toribio 
Raquenio because he used to go to my house sometimes with Romy (Alejandro 
Carillo) and one named Nestor; they used to go there about three times a week. 
The Japanese pistol Exhibit N was the service pistol issued to me by the 
Department of the Interior in my capacity as secret agent of said Department, 
and that pistol was defective. I gave it to my wife and secured another permit 
for a .45 caliber pistol. On June 4,1947, that pistol was placed by my wife in 
her vanity case and put under a drawer of the <em>aparador</em> in my house on 
Calavite. I did not at any time lend that pistol to Toribio Raquenio. After June 
23 or 24 (1947) I delivered that pistol (Exhibit N) to a repair shop. Members of 
the Detective Bureau went personally to the repair shop to get it, but because 
they could not get it without my presence I went to get it myself and I gave it 
to them. That was after I had delivered to the Detective Bureau on July 1 the 
.45 caliber automatic pistol Exhibit I. Exhibit I was given to my wife Antonieta 
Salazar by one Romy, according to her, but I was not present when it was given 
to her.</p></blockquote>
<p>Antonieta Salazar, 34) married to Simeon Madayag, and residing at 1472 
Calavite, Quezon City, testified in substance as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know the pistol Exhibit I because that was left in my possession by Romy 
(pointing to Alejandro Carillo) on June 7, 1947. He told me, 'Mining, I am going 
to leave this (Exhibit I) to you first because I have to go somewhere." He did 
not tell me where he was going at that time. I came to know Alejandro Carillo in 
May, 1947, when he went to the Funeraria Nacional. According to him he knew my 
brother-in-law who died. Since then he used to come to our house for a visit. 
Sometimes he would come alone and at other times he would come with companions. 
I also know Toribio Raquenio (pointing to the defendant by that name) because he 
used to be with Romy when he came to the house. I know the Japanese pistol 
Exhibit N "because this is the revolver that my husband used when he was new in 
the Department of the Interior." On June 4, 1947, it was in my vanity case which 
I placed in the drawer under my <em>aparador</em>. Although I received the 
pistol Exhibit I from Alejandro Carillo on June 7, 1947, I did not report the 
matter to my husband until June 29 or 30 because he was not at home. I was 
waiting for the owner to get it. The pistol Exhibit N was taken by the police 
from the repair shop.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have heretofore narrated in chronological order the facts and developments 
of the case as established by the prosecution through the testimony of 
Detectives Jesus P. Senen, Wenceslao R. Leano, Jose Dimagiba, Leon O. Garcia, 
and Tomas Calazan, Police Photographer Remigio Abolencia, Ballistics Expert 
Edgar Bond, and witnesses Marcelino Lontok, Jr., Simeon C. Madayag, and 
Antonieta Salazar, and through the written statements Exhibits H and F of 
Alejandro Carillo and Exhibit E of Toribio Raquenio. We shall now relate the 
evidence for the defense.</p>
<p>Aside from his own testimony, Alejandro Carillo presented only one witness, 
Narciso Villegas. The latter testified that he was 23 years of age, single, a 
prisoner at Muntinlupa, convicted of robbery; that while he was detained in the 
isolation cell in Bilibid Prison, he saw the accused Alejandro Carillo there two 
months before October 1, 1947 (that is to say, about August 1, 1947); that he 
(witness) was the one keeping the key to the cells of the prisoners; that it was 
his duty to search a prisoner for the isolation cell to see whether he had some 
contraband with him; that when he tried to search the person of Alejandro 
Carillo, the latter told him that the sides of his body were painful and 
requested his permission to take off his clothes himself; that witness allowed, 
him to do so "and when he took off his clothes I saw something in his body in 
that the left side of his body and under his chest, left side, was bluish in 
color. I asked him why his body was black, and he told me, 'I was maltreated by 
the secret service men.' I allowed him to get inside the isolation cell, telling 
his companion prisoners to allow him to lie down because he was not feeling 
well. That is all I can say." On cross-examination he testified that the 
conversation he had with Carillo was witnessed by the guard who had brought 
Carillo; that the guard did not attempt to stop him from talking with Carillo 
"because I was the one in charge of the key and it was necessary that I should 
search his pockets."</p>
<p>Testifying in his own behalf, Alejandro Carillo declared that on the 
afternoon of June 4, 1947, he was in Quiapo, Manila, working as a laborer or 
<em>cargador</em> in the market; that he worked until 9 o'clock in the evening, 
when he went home and did not go out any more; that he did not know his 
coaccused Toribio Raquenio until the day the latter was arrested "because the 
policemen were insisting that I was his companion"; that he did not know 
anything as to the accusation against him of having robbed and killed Emma 
Foronda-Abaya on June 4, 1947; that he was not on Aurora Avenue and Pampanga 
Street, Manila, on June 4, 1947; that he was arrested by the police in June in 
Tacloban, Leyte; that after his arrest he was ordered by those who arrested him 
to admit "that case which occurred"; that he did not jet sign any document then; 
that he signed Exhibit F in Manila; that "they ordered me to sign that document 
Exhibit F without my knowing its contents, they only told me to sign it"; that 
he did not give the police the information contained in Exhibit F; that he did 
not sign Exhibit F voluntarily but was forced to do so; that from Tacloban he 
had fear of them because they were pointing their revolvers at him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. They only pointed at you their revolvers?—A. Yes, they pointed a revolver 
at my stomach and they beat me in the body.</p>
<p>"Q. "Who beat you in the body?—A. Those who arrested me."</p></blockquote>
<p>He admitted his signature to Exhibit H but claimed that he signed it without 
knowing its contents and that before signing it they did not read its contents 
to him. He further testified that he did not know the watch Exhibit D; that he 
knew the revolver Exhibit I because on June 6 a friend of his named Nestor 
delivered it to him; that at first he did not want to receive it because it had 
no license, but that he was afraid of Nestor because he always beat him and for 
that reason he told Nestor, "Well, I am going to receive this Exhibit I on 
condition that I shall not use it; I shall keep it"; that when he went to Leyte 
on June B he did not have the revolver in his possession because he left it with 
a friend of his who lived in La Loma. He denied having sold the watch Exhibit D 
to Macawile. He claimed that his acts depicted in the photographs of the 
re-enactment of the crime, Exhibits B-5, B-8, B-9, B-10, B-11, and B-12, were 
not voluntary but that he acceded to the wishes of the police because he was 
afraid of them because they carried long revolvers.</p>
<p>On cross-examination he admitted that the house on Esperanza street where he 
lived on June 4, 1947, was the same house where Saturnine Macawile lived; that 
he had lived with Saturnino Macawile less than two years; that it was true that 
during the Japanese occupation he used to go with Macawile but that he did not 
live with him in the same house then; that before going to Leyte he entrusted 
the revolver Exhibit I to a friend of his whom he knew as Aling Tuning; that he 
delivered said revolver to Aling Tuning although Nestor did not know her 
"because if I kept that revolver in my possession I possibly would be in bad 
plight because that revolver had no license."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. If that is true, why did you accept this revolver from Nestor?—A. Because 
he was in a hurry and he only left this on the table and then left.</p>
<p>"Q. Is that all the explanation you can give?—A. Yes, sir."</p></blockquote>
<p>He reiterated that on June 4 he went home at 9 o'clock; that he knew it was 9 
o'clock because he had many friends in that house and he asked them what time it 
was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. Why did you go home very late that night?—A. I went home quite late that 
night because I entertained myself in the pool.</p>
<p>"Q. What is that pool you are referring to?—A. It is a kind of game. I know 
how to play it.</p>
<p>"Q. Do you play pool every night?—A. I do not play but only used to see.</p>
<p>"Q. Are you very sure that on June 4, 1947, about 9 o'clock in the evening, 
you were playing pool?—A. I was not playing, I was only watching those playing 
pool."</p></blockquote>
<p>He admitted that after he was brought to the police station the police asked 
him many questions, but claimed that he was confused because they asked him many 
things; that he answered them indifferently because he had bad presentiments 
about his mother and he was confused and did not know what he was saying; that 
those who asked him questions did not write anything down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. Did anyone of those who have testified here beat you?—A. None of those 
who testified here beat me, because I know by face those who maltreated 
me."</p></blockquote>
<p>The accused Toribio Raquenio was the only one who testified in his own 
behalf. He gave his personal circumstances as 37 years of age, single, residing 
at 55 Main street, Sampaloc, Manila. He declared in substance as follows: He was 
out of work on June 4, 1947, and was looking for a job then. He did not remember 
having gone out on June 4, 1947. He did not know the accused Alejandro Carillo, 
<em>alias</em> Romy. He did not know anything about the accusation against him 
of having, in company with Alejandro Carillo, held up and robbed Emma 
Foronda-Abaya and Marcelino Lontok, Jr. He did not remember where he was on June 
4, 1947. He was arrested on June 26. The signature on Exhibit E is his. He did 
not know the contents of Exhibit E; it was not read to him by the police. He 
signed it because he was maltreated and in proof of that he had a scar on the 
lower lip. He was maltreated by a detective whom he knew by face but who was not 
then in court. He was maltreated before he signed Exhibit E; he was kicked, and 
when he fell on the floor they continued kicking him and he spat blood. He 
admitted that he knew Simeon Madayag. He did not know whether Simeon Madayag 
possessed the .38 caliber Japanese Luger. He denied that he ever went with 
Alejandro Carillo to the house of Simeon Madayag. He did not know whether the 
contents of Exhibit E are true or not.</p>
<p>On cross-examination he admitted having stayed in America 19 years. He 
indicated Detective Wenceslao Leano as the one and only one who had maltreated 
him. He said that after his arrest the police asked him many questions, but that 
he never answered any of the questions, and that is the reason why "they 
maltreated me"; that the only question he answered was that about his civil 
status. He admitted that he is from Cabugao, Ilocos Sur. He also admitted that 
he has an uncle named Jesus Acosta who lives at 73 Nacar, San Andres. Upon being 
interrogated by the court, he reiterated that he knew Simeon Madayag and knew 
where he lived but did not know the number. He admitted having been to the house 
of Simeon Madayag but that he went there alone for a visit, looking for 
work.<br><br>The accused Saturnino Macawile, testifying in his own behalf, 
declared that he bought the Bulova watch Exhibit D from Romy (indicating the 
accused Alejandro Carillo) for P3 on June 5 at 6:30 a.m. at his (witness') store 
in Quiapo; that he sold it for P10 to one Bidoy; that he did not know that it 
was a stolen watch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. Did the detectives employ force or maltreat you before you told them from 
whom you bought this watch Exhibit D?—"A. No, sir."</p></blockquote>
<p>He said that he knew Alejandro Carillo only by the name Romy; that Romy used 
to go to his house because he courted someone there, the daughter of his 
<em>comadre</em>.</p>
<p>Upon the evidence above set forth, Judge Felipe Natividad found the accused 
Alejandro Carillo guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of 
robbery with homicide, without any mitigating or aggravating circumstance, and 
sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify 
the heirs of the deceased Emma Foronda-Abaya in the sum of P2,000, and to return 
the stolen articles or their value aggregating P231.40; and the accused Toribio 
Raquenio guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of against 
robbery with violence against and intimidation of person, without any mitigating 
or aggravating circumstance, and sentenced him to suffer an indeterminate 
penalty of from 4 years and 2 months of <em>prision correccional</em> as minimum 
to 8 years of <em>prision mayor</em> as maximum and to indemnify, jointly and 
severally with his coaccused Alejandro Carillo, the offended parties in the sums 
of P131 and P100.40, respectively. The accused Saturnino Macawile was acquitted 
on reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>In their joint appeal, Alejandro Carillo and Toribio Raquenio, thru their 
counsel <em>de oficio</em>, challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to 
establish their guilt and ask for their acquittal. The Solicitor General, on the 
other hand, recommends the imposition of the death penalty on the appellant 
Alejandro Carillo and the increase of the maximum penalty meted out to appellant 
Toribio Raquenio.</p>
<p>Having heretofore set forth in detail the evidence adduced during the trial, 
our task in resolving the appeal is reduced to analyzing the chain of direct and 
circumstantial evidence against the appellants to determine whether there is any 
missing or defective link which might warrant reversal.</p>
<p>The direct evidence consists of (1) the testimony of the eyewitness Marcelino 
Lontok, Jr., and (2) the confessions of the accused. The circumstantial evidence 
consists of (1) the sale by Alejandro Carillo to Saturnino Macawile on the 
morning of June 5, 1947, of the Bulova watch Exhibit D, of which Marcelino 
Lontok, Jr., had been robbed the previous evening; (2) the admission by Carillo 
and Macawile during the trial that they had known each other and had lived in 
the same house for a long time, thus precluding any possible mistake by Macawile 
as to the identity of Carillo as the seller of said watch; (3) the .45 caliber 
pistol Exhibit I, which was conclusively established to be the gun from which 
the two empty shells Exhibits J and J-1 found at the scene of the crime had been 
fired; (4) the testimony of the spouses Simeon Madayag and Antonieta Salazar 
that said pistol was left by Alejandro Carillo with Antonieta Salazar on June 7, 
1947, which fact was not denied but indirectly admitted by Alejandro Carillo 
during the trial; (5) the testimony of the same spouses that the two appellants 
knew each other and used to frequent the house of said spouses at 1472 Calavite, 
La Loma, Quezon City; (6) the .38 caliber Japanese Luger pistol Exhibit N, which 
according to the confession of Toribio Raquenio he took from the house of said 
spouses and used in committing the crime in question and which said spouses 
identified during the trial; and (7) the flight of Alejandro Carillo to 
Tacloban, Leyte, shortly after the commission of the crime. We find no defective 
link in this strong chain of circumstantial evidence, which dovetails with the 
chain of direct evidence.</p>
<p>Appellant Carillo hammers on the weakness of the testimony of Marcelino 
Lontok, Jr., as to his identity, it appearing that said witness at first pointed 
to Macawile in lieu of Carillo. Considering that Lontok and his companion were 
held up at night, although with moonlight, and that the robbers were unknown to 
him, his testimony alone as to their identity would not be sufficient to convict 
the appellants, for his identification of them under the circumstances could not 
be absolutely relied upon, as indeed he at first mistook Macawile for Carillo in 
view of some resemblance between the two. It was, however, undoubtedly a mistake 
in good faith, not indicative of a will to 'prevaricate and not sufficient to 
divest his testimony of probatory value as to the identity of the appellants, if 
we consider it, as we must, together with the rest of the evidence in this case. 
The trial judge, who saw both Carillo and Macawile and who took Lontok's 
testimony into consideration, must have been satisfied with Lontok's explanation 
of his mistake due to the resemblance between the said two accused as pointed 
out by Lontok during the trial.</p>
<p>The other link of direct evidence is the written confessions of the two 
appellants before the members of the Detective Bureau. Inasmuch as these 
confessions were respectively repudiated by the appellants during the trial, we 
have to examine with caution and care the circumstances under which they were 
given and the inherent veracity of their contents in relation to appellants' 
testimony during the trial, to determine whether they had been illegally 
extorted from them as they claimed. We are not unaware that some officers of the 
law resort to the illegal and reprehensible tactics of extorting confessions 
thru violence and intimidation, and we have had occasion to express our 
condemnation of such tactics. Thus, in the case of People <em>vs</em>. Ricardo 
Tipay, G.R. No. 49014 (March 31, 1944), we said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this noonday of the twentieth century, when criminology and the 
investigation of crimes have developed into a science in all civilized countries 
abreast with the progress and the ever-increasing enlightenment of the human 
race, to force or induce a suspect to incriminate himself thru violence, 
torture, or trickery is a shameful disgrace—a reversion into the barbarism and 
the inquisitorial practices of the Dark Ages; and the minions of the law who 
would still resort to such crude and cruel methods are universally regarded as 
anachronistic blockheads, who should be immediately lopped off as a cancerous 
excrescence of the body politic."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first written confession of appellant Alejandro Carillo is Exhibit II, 
which was taken by questions and answers in Tagalog by Detective D. Lapiña in 
the presence of Detective L. O. Garcia and written down by Stenographer D. B. 
Ferrer between 3:20 and 6:30 p.m. on June 24, 1947, the day after Carillo was 
arrested in Tacloban, Leyte. Detective Garcia, as a witness for the prosecution, 
swore during the trial that Carillo answered the questions propounded to him by 
Detective Diosdado Lapina and voluntarily signed and swore to Exhibit H before 
Fiscal Villamor after the latter had read and explained its contents to the 
affiant, it is apparent from Exhibit H that it contains information which was 
known only to the affiant and which could not have been known before by the 
investigator: the personal circumstances of the affiant; the places where he had 
resided before; that at the age of 7 he was confined in Welfareville for theft; 
that he knew Frank (his coappellant); that he and Frank were in the house at 
1472 Calavite, La Loma, Quezon City, about 5 o'clock on June 4, 1947, and that 
from that house they went together to commit the crime in question; that he was 
then armed with a 45-caliber pistol and Frank, with a Japanese Luger. At that 
time he told an untruth when he told the investigator that the .45 caliber 
automatic pistol he used belonged to Frank and that after the crime he returned 
it to the latter before they separated. As a matter of fact, it was the 
revelation made by appellant Carillo in Exhibit H that led the detectives to 
arrest his coappellant Toribio Raquenio, <em>alias</em> Frank. And after the 
latter was arrested, Carillo was subjected to further interrogatories by 
Detective Senen in the presence of Detective Calazan, as shown by Exhibit F, in 
which Carillo identified Raquenio as the same person to whom he had referred as 
Frank. It was then that for the first time Carillo revealed the truth that the 
gun he had used had been left by him in the house of Simeon Madayag at 1472 
Calavite and that that gun was his (Carillo's). Again it was thru that 
information that the detectives recovered the .45 caliber pistol Exhibit I from 
Madayag.</p>
<p>It will be recalled that before Carillo was arrested in Tacloban, Leyte, on 
June 23, the detectives entertained the theory that the holdup men were 
Saturnino Macawile and an unknown individual designated in the original 
information as John Doe. The detectives did not then know the facts revealed by 
Carillo for the first time in his confessions Exhibits H and F. We therefore 
cannot give credence to the insinuation made by Carillo for the first time 
during the trial of the case that the contents of Exhibits H and F were mere 
inventions of the detectives. The veracity of tire facts set forth in said 
exhibits, with the exception of the statement made by Carillo in Exhibit H that 
the 45-caliber pistol belonged to Frank and was returned by him to the latter 
after the commission of the crime, cannot be doubted. The very falsity of said 
statement as to the ownership of the pistol, which Carillo subsequently 
rectified in Exhibit F, is in itself a clear proof that the contents of Exhibits 
H and F were not a fabrication of the detectives.</p>
<p>No one can doubt the veracity of a statement that turns out to be in 
conformity with the reality. If a person tells the police that he killed an 
individual with a revolver after robbing him or his watch and that he buried his 
victim at a certain place and hid the revolver in another place and delivered 
the watch to another person, and if the police finds the corpse in the place 
indicated by the killer and identifies it as that of the victim, and finds the 
revolver in the other place mentioned by the confessed killer and also recovers 
the watch from the person to whom the killer said he had delivered it, it would 
be impossible not to believe the statement of the killer even if he should 
subsequently deny it. What could not be believed is such denial.</p>
<p>Equally unbelievable is the testimony of Carillo during the trial when at 
first he said that he signed Exhibits F and H without knowing their contents 
because the detectives ordered him to do so; then later he gave a stronger 
reason by saying that he was afraid of the police because they were pointing 
their revolvers at him; and still later, after being prompted by his counsel, he 
gave a still stronger reason by saying that they beat him in the body. But on 
cross-examination, when asked whether any of the detectives who had testified 
before him had beaten him, he answered that none of them had. He could not point 
to any particular person as his alleged torturer. He did not even care to 
corroborate the testimony of his only witness, Narciso Villegas, for the 
latter's testimony was not in any way referred to by him when he (Carillo) took 
the witness stand.</p>
<p>The testimony of Narciso Villegas is inherently incredible. In the first 
place, he was a convict of a crime involving moral turpitude—robbery. In the 
second place, if as he said he was in the isolation cell, we must assume that he 
was under disciplinary punishment and could not therefore have been entrusted 
with the duty of the a trusty such as keeping the keys. Carillo, who was not yet 
then a convict but a mere detention prisoner, could not have been placed in the 
isolation cell. And, lastly, the alleged physical examination or inspection made 
by Convict Villegas, during which he claimed to have found a bluish spot on the 
chest of Carillo, took place, according to him, about August 1, 1947, that is to 
say, more than one month after Carillo had signed Exhibits H and F. In any 
event, even assuming that there was such a bluish spot on Carillo's body, 
Carillo did not explain or refer to it when he testified.<br><br>In this 
connection it is significant to note that although the detectives at first 
suspected Saturnino Macawile as the one who had robbed, ravished, and killed 
Emma Foronda-Abaya, they did not use any force upon or maltreat him to extort a 
confession from him, according to his own testimony.</p>
<p>We must, therefore, conclude that Carillo's confessions Exhibits H and F were 
made by him voluntarily and without the employment of force or intimidation on 
him.</p>
<p>The alibi set up by Carillo as a defense hardly merits any consideration at 
all. At first he claimed, that he worked in the Quiapo market as a 
<em>cargador</em> until 9 o'clock in the evening on June 4, 1947. Later, on 
cross-examination he said that he stayed out late on that day because he was in 
a poolroora watching the game.</p>
<p>Neither can we believe his testimony that the pistol Exhibit I was delivered 
to him on June 6 by a friend of his named Nestor. At first he said that he 
accepted the gun from Nestor although it had no license because he was afraid of 
Nestor, as the latter always beat him. But on cross-examination he changed that 
testimony by saying that he accepted the gun from Nestor because the latter was 
in a hurry "and he only left this on the table and then left."</p>
<p>The conclusion is inescapable from the foregoing analysis of the evidence 
that it leaves no room for any hypothesis consistent with appellant Alejandro 
Carillo's innocence. We do not entertain the slightest doubt that he is guilty 
of the capital offense of robbery with homicide and attempted rape, with which 
he was charged and duly tried. We shall consider the appropriate penalty 
later.</p>
<p>With regard to appellant Toribio Raquenio, he did not even care to set up an 
alibi. He said he did not remember where he was on June 4, 1947. We find that 
his guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt by his confession Exhibit E; 
by the testimony of Marcelino Lontok, Jr., who identified him as the robber who 
held him up at the point of a gun and robbed him; and by the testimony of the 
spouses Simeon Madayag and Antonieta Salazar. His confession Exhibit E contains 
information regarding himself that could not have been known to the police. His 
claim, therefore, that it was a mere invention or fabrication of the police 
cannot be believed.</p>
<p>Neither can we accept his pretension that he signed said confession because 
he had been maltreated. At first he said that the detective who had maltreated 
him was not in court. Later he indicated Detective Wenceslao Leano, who was in 
court, as the one who had maltreated him. In rebuttal Detective Leano denied 
that imputation, saying that he was not the one who took the statement of 
Raquenio and did not take part in his investigation. Exhibit E shows that it was 
taken by Detective Tomas A. Calazan in the presence of Detective Senen. And 
Detective Jesus P. Senen testified that Raquenio answered the questions 
propounded to him by Detective Calaaan and signed the statement voluntarily 
after having read it.</p>
<p>We likewise, therefore, do not entertain any doubt as to the guilt of this 
appellant.</p>
<p>Appellant Toribio Raquenio did not participate in the attempted rape and 
killing of Emma Foronda-Abaya but tried to induce his companion Alejandro 
Carillo to desist therefrom. The trial court was right in finding him guilty 
only of robbery with violence against and intimidation of person, which is 
penalized in paragraph 5 of article 294 of the Revised Penal Code with <i>prision 
correccional</i> in its maximum to <em>prision mayor</em> in its medium period. 
However, the trial court erred in not considering the aggravating circumstance 
of nocturnity, which facilitated the commission of the offense and rendered 
detection difficult (People <em>vs</em>. Corpus, 43 Off.Gaz., 2249).</p>
<p>Therefore, with the only modification that the maximum of the indeterminate 
penalty imposed should be, as it is hereby, increased to ten years of 
<em>prision mayor</em>, the sentence as to the appellant Toribio Raquenio is 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p>The appellant Alejandro Carillo is guilty of robbery with homicide as well as 
of attempted rape. Robbery with homicide is penalized in paragraph 1 of article 
294 with <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to <em>death</em>. The trial court erred in 
not considering the aggravating circumstances of (1) recidivism, said appellant 
having been convicted twice of robbery; (2) nocturnity, which facilitated the 
commission of the offense and rendered detection difficult; and (3) abuse of 
superior strength, considering his sex and the weapon he used in the act which 
overcame the victim and rendered her unable to defend herself from his savage 
aggression (United States <em>vs</em>. Gonsuelo, 13 Phil. 612). The attempted 
rape committed by this appellant on the same occasion may be penalized 
separately, but we think there is no need to do so, and we consider it only as a 
further aggravation of the offense. There is no mitigating circumstance.</p>
<p>Alejandro Carillo has proved himself to be a dangerous enemy of society. The 
latter must protect itself from such enemy by taking his life in retribution for 
his offense and as an example and warning to others. In these days of rampant 
criminality it should have a salutary effect upon the criminally minded to know 
that the courts do not shirk teas their disagreeable duty to impose the death 
f&amp; penalty in cases where the law so requires.</p>
<p>Conformably to the recommendation of the Solicitor General, we modify the 
sentence of the trial court as to the appellant Alejandro Carillo y Almadin by 
imposing, as we hereby impose upon him, the penalty of death, affirming the 
sentence in all other respects. This sentence shall be executed in accordance 
with the provisions of articles 81 and 82 of the Revised Penal Code on a date to 
be fixed by the trial court within thirty days after the return of the record of 
the case to said court. It is so ordered.</p>
