				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for the review of a decision rendered by the Public 
Service Commission in Cases Nos. 113106 and 113956.
<p>The records show that on February 12, 1958, the herein respondents Teresita 
L. Parpana and Ramon Papa, Jr., filed with the said Commission an application 
for a certificate of public convenience to install and operate an ice plant in 
the municipality of Tagudin, province of Ilocos Sur, with a productive capacity 
of 10 tons of ice daily, proposing to sell the ice they manufacture in said 
municipality of Tagudin and in the towns of Sevilla, Sta. Cruz, Sta. Lucia, 
Candon, Santiago and San Esteban, of the same province, as well as in the towns 
of Balaoan, Bangar, Sudipen, Luna and Bacnotan of the province of La Union. 
(Case No. 113106.) The application was opposed by Ruben L.Â» Valero and his wife 
Estrella; L. de Valero, herein petitioners, who alleged that they are; the 
established operators with ice plants in San Fernando, La Union, and Candon, 
Ilocos Sur; that they are authorized to sell ice in all the towns which 
applicants Parpana and Papa propose to serve with' the plant they seek to 
install in Tagudin; and that, consequently, they (the Valero spouses) have a 
better right to a certificate of public convenience to operate a new ice plant 
in Tagudin. A month later, or on March 12, 1958, petitioners filed their own 
application for a certificate to install and operate a 3.6-ton ice plant in the 
same municipality of Tagudin with authority to sell the produce in said 
municipality as well as in San Fernando, San Juan, Bacnotan, Luna and Bangar, 
province of La Union, and in the towns of Sta. Cruz, Sta. Lucia and Candon, of 
Ilocos Sur. (Case No. 113956.)</p>
<p>Respondents' application, upon their motion, was heard before the Justice of 
the Peace Court of Tagudin, while that of petitioners was heard before the 
Commission in Manila. Before petitioner's application could be decided, however, 
respondents filed a petition asking that it be decided jointly with their own 
application, which petition was granted by the Commission.</p>
<p>From the evidence presented, the Commission found that there is sufficient 
need for ice service in the towns covered by the two applications to warrant the 
authorization of another ice plant in the municipality of Tagudin. Indeed, the 
need could hardly be disputed since both applicants have applied for such 
service. Excluding from those proposed to be served some of the towns which are 
very far from the site of the plant, the Commission authorized the establishment 
of an ice plant capable of producing 5 tons of ice daily. And finding that 
petitioners Valero spouses have not increased for the last 11 years the tonnage 
capacity of their two ice plants so as to meet the increased demand of ice in 
the territory they are authorized to serve, the Commission in its decision dated 
November 3, 1958 denied their application and approved that of Parpana and Papa, 
Jr., herein respondents, for a 5-ton plant in Tagudin, Ilocos Sur, with right to 
sell the ice they manufacture in said municipality of Tagudin, as well as in 
Sevilla, Sta. Cruz and Sta. Lucia of Ilocos Sur and in the towns of Bangar, 
Sudipen, Luna and Bacnotan of the province of La Union.</p>
<p>In seeking a review of the decision below, counsel for petitioners contends 
that the Commission erred in holding that petitioners have failed to meet the 
increased demand of ice in the territory covered by their franchises. On this 
point the Commission made the following findings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Since 1947 or for 11 years up to now, applicants Valeros have been 
satisfied to operate their two plants with a total capacity of 7 tons daily to 
serve the ice requirements of 17 municipalities of La Union and Ilocos Sur. 
Among these municipalities is San Fernando, the capital of La Union. The 
evidence discloses that just the six towns of Sta. Cruz, Bangar, Luna, San 
Esteban, Tagudin and Santiago have at present a total population of 94,0001 San 
Fernando, Candon, and Narvacan are first class towns with big populations and as 
it has shown that with the years these towns as well as the others have 
continued to grow and there are in most of them hospitals, hotels, restaurants, 
refreshment parlors and other business establishments which need ice everyday. 
As operators of the San Fernando and Candon Plants, the Valeros knew or should 
have known that their 7-ton production which probably was adequate 11 years ago 
cannot now and during the last few years meet satisfactorily the ice demands of 
the public in the towns which they are called upon to serve and yet it does not 
appear that the Valeros at any time sought to increase the production of their 
plants so as to meet these increasing demands except when they filed their 
application for a plant in Tagudin one month after the application of Parpana 
and Papa was filed. There seems to he merit in the contention of applicants 
Parpana and Papa that the Valeros did not make any effort to bring about an 
increase in their service until somebody else sought to put up an ice plant 
within their territory. * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p>From an examination of the records, we find the above findings to be amply 
supported by the evidence and consequently cannot now be disturbed. In reviewing 
a decision of the Public Service Commission this Court "will not substitute its 
discretion for that of the Commission on questions of fact and will not 
interfere in the latter's decision unless it clearly appears that there is no 
evidence to support it." (Santiago Ice Plant and Co. <em>vs</em>. Lahoz, 87 
Phil., 221; 47 Off. Gaz. [12] 403; Pineda <em>vs</em>. Carandang, 107 Phil., 
369; 58 Off. Gaz., [32] 5427.)</p>
<p>It is alleged that on August 27, 1957 petitioners actually applied for the 
operation of a 2-ton capacity ice plant in Balaoan, La Union, which application 
is still pending. It would appear, however, that they filed said application 
only after one Victorio B. Flores had the month before filed an application to 
install and operate an ice plant in said municipality of Balaoan, which was also 
opposed by petitioners. (See Cases Nos. 10825 and 109029.) This was exactly what 
happened in Case No. 113106 concerning respondents' application now under 
consideration. Apparently, the subsequent filing by petitioners of an 
application of their own was a tactical move to secure for themselves, as 
established operators, preference in the grant of authority for additional 
service, should the Commission decide after hearing that there is need for such 
additional service. Such tactical move, however, cannot hide the fact, as found 
by the Commission, that over a period of many years, petitioners failed to take 
steps to increase their service and facilities so as to be able to cope with the 
increasing demands of the public. For this reason, the Commission correctly held 
that petitioners cannot claim preferential right as an old operator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Moreover, even assuming for a moment that petitioner were an old operator on 
the line in question, nevertheless he has not applied for an increase in his 
service but allowed another to do so; and according to a line of decisions, it 
has been ruled that the granting of preference to an old operator applies only 
when said old operator has made an offer to meet the increase in traffic and not 
when another operator even a new one, like respondent * * *, has made the offer 
to serve the new line or increased the service on said line." (Manila Yellow 
Taxicab Co., Inc. <em>vs</em>. Castelo, 108 Phil., 394; 59 Off. Gaz., 694; see 
also cases cited therein.)</p></blockquote>
<p>There being no reason to disturb the decision brought here for review, the 
same is hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioners.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed.</em></p></div>
