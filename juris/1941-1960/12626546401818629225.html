				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; seeking to&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside the order entered on December 31,1956 by the Hon. Judge Jose S.&nbsp; Bautista, Presiding Judge, Court of Industrial Relations, denying the motion to.dismiss filed by petitioner on the ground of lack of jurisdiction as well as the resolution of said court <i>en banc</i> dated January ยง, 1957 affirming the aforesaid order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>On&nbsp; May 7, 1956, respondent union declared a&nbsp; strike against petitioner.&nbsp; The strike was&nbsp; preceded&nbsp; by&nbsp; negotiations between respondent union&nbsp; and petitioner regarding the case of 23 union members whom petitioner previously dismissed for cause, and of 12 other union members who were suspended for&nbsp; absenting themselves without&nbsp; leave in violation&nbsp; of the company regulations.<br><br>Shortly after the strike&nbsp; was declared, the Conciliation Service of the Department of Labor took cognizance of the dispute and tried to effect a settlement between petitioner and respondent union.&nbsp; On&nbsp; July 26, 1956, while the negotiations&nbsp; were&nbsp; still&nbsp; in&nbsp; progress,&nbsp; counsel for&nbsp; respondent union&nbsp; wrote the Secretary&nbsp; of Labor requesting that the dispute be referred&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations for compulsory arbitration&nbsp; pursuant to the provisions of Section 16 (c) of the Minimum Wage Law&nbsp; (Republic Act 602).&nbsp; Heeding counsel's request,&nbsp; the Secretary of Labor, on August 8, 1956', wrote Presiding Judge Jose&nbsp; S. Bautista of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations informing him that he is endorsing the dispute to said court pursuant to "Sections 1&nbsp; and 4,&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 103,&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp; in conjunction with Section 16 (c), Republic Act No. 602, as amended,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Section 7, Republic Act No.&nbsp; 875."&nbsp; Acceding to&nbsp; the&nbsp; endorsement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Secretary of&nbsp; Labor,&nbsp; Judge Bautista accepted the dispute, had it docketed as Case No. 1029-V, and ordered summons to&nbsp; be issued to petitioner.<br><br>Shortly upon receipt of the summons, petitioner filed a motion to&nbsp; dismiss based, among others, on&nbsp; the following grounds:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; "that&nbsp; the demand mentioned&nbsp; in&nbsp; Section 16 of the Minimum Wage Law is one for the payment. of minimum wage above the statutory minimum, and not for the recovery of&nbsp; wage differentials";&nbsp; and (2)&nbsp; "That Section 7 of Republic Act 875 has repealed the&nbsp; provision of Section&nbsp; 16&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; of the Minimum Wage Law so that the Court of Industrial Relations had no jurisdiction over the case of the union members dismissed and suspended by petitioner."<br><br>Respondent union opposed petitioners' motion to dismiss contending,&nbsp; among others, that its claim 'against petitioner is one&nbsp; for&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; minimum wage&nbsp; and since this claim is one of the issues involved in the strike of May 7, 1956,&nbsp; the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations has jurisdiction over the case under Section 16 (c) of Republic Act 602.<br><br>On&nbsp; December 13,&nbsp; 1956, after hearing, Judge&nbsp; Bautista issued an order denying petitioner's motion to dismiss.&nbsp; He held that&nbsp; the dispute between petitioner and&nbsp; respondent "refers to minimum wages for the members of the petitioning union claim that deductions&nbsp; from&nbsp; their wages had been made in violation of the&nbsp; Minimum Wage Law and consequently, the wages were reduced below the statutory limit", and that all the conditions required by Section 16 (c)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Minimum Wage Law are present thus giving jurisdiction&nbsp; to the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations to entertain the case.&nbsp; He further held that respondent union's claim also refers to "non-payment of overtime premium" and under Section 7&nbsp; of Republic Act 875,&nbsp; said court has jurisdiction to act on cases involving the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No. 444).<br><br>Dissatisfied with said&nbsp; order, petitioner&nbsp; filed a motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; reiterating&nbsp; practically the&nbsp; grounds already advanced in its motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss, but the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> denied the motion&nbsp; in a resolution entered on May 21, 1957, Judges Bautista, Villanueva and Tabigne voted to sustain the court's jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; Judge Lanting&nbsp; and Martinez dissented from the majority ruling.&nbsp; Hence the present petition for review by&nbsp; way of certiorari.<br><br>The questions raised by petitioner are:<br><blockquote>"1. Is a claim for the refund of illegal deductions&nbsp; from salaries and for underpayment of&nbsp; overtime premium a demand for minimum wage?<br><br>"2. Does the Court of Industrial Relations have jurisdiction to try and decide cases for the recovery of illegal deductions and overtime premium? <br><br>"3. May a case endorsed&nbsp; by the Secretary of Labor to the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations pursuant to Section 16 (c)&nbsp; of the Minimum. Wage Law be heard by a single judge of the said court?<br><br>"4. May the Court of Industrial Relations take cognizance of the issue of the reinstatement&nbsp; of dismissed and&nbsp; suspended union members&nbsp; in a case endorsed by the Secretary of Labor&nbsp; under Section 16 (c)&nbsp; of the Minimum Wage&nbsp; Law?"<br></blockquote>With regard to the&nbsp; first point, petitioner argues:&nbsp; "The claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent union for wage&nbsp; differentials is not a demand for the payment of a minimum wage.&nbsp; Minimum wage is the&nbsp; rate of pay, established either by statute or by minimum wage order, payable to a worker&nbsp; or&nbsp; to a particular class of worker.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wage differentials claimed by respondent&nbsp; union are for alleged illegal deductions, and underpayment." The&nbsp; first&nbsp; item consists of amounts deducted by petitioner from the wages of its&nbsp; employees for the value of the sundry facilities, such as housing, rice, light, water, etc., furnished by petitioner which respondent union claims is not supported by the corresponding evaluation&nbsp; order of the Department of Labor.&nbsp; The&nbsp; second item refers to overtime&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; which respondent union claims&nbsp; has not been&nbsp;&nbsp; correctly&nbsp;&nbsp; computed.&nbsp; From&nbsp; these arguments, petitioner draws the inference that there&nbsp; is no dispute as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; basic wages paid by petitioner to its employees and so the case does not come within the jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations.<br><br>In claiming&nbsp; jurisdiction over the dispute1 between&nbsp; petitioner and respondent union, the industrial court invokes Section 16 (e)&nbsp; of the Minimum Wage Law, which provides:<br><blockquote>"(c) When the demands of minimum wages involve&nbsp; an actual strike, the matter shall be submitted&nbsp; to the Secretary of Labor, who shall attempt to secure a settlement between the parties through conciliation.&nbsp; Should the Secretary fail within fifteen days to effect&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said&nbsp; settlement, lie&nbsp; shall indorsed the matter&nbsp; together&nbsp; with other issues involved, to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; which&nbsp; will acquire jurisdiction&nbsp; on the ease including the minimum wages issue, and after&nbsp; a hearing where the views of the Secretary of Labor will be given, will decide the case in the same manner as provided in other cases.&nbsp; The decision shall be rendered by the court in bane within fifteen: days after the case has been submitted for determination, and its "finding of facts, shall be conclusive if&nbsp; supported by substantial&nbsp; evidence, and shall be&nbsp; subject only to an appeal by certiorari"<br></blockquote>Analyzing the&nbsp; above-quoted provision,&nbsp; it Would&nbsp; appear that the elements that must concur to confer jurisdiction upon the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations are: (a) a demand for minimum wages: (b)&nbsp; the demand must involve actual strike; (c) submission of the matter to the Secretary of Labor for settlement; (d) failure of the Secretary of Labor to effect settlement within 15 days; and&nbsp; (e) endorsement of the dispute "together with other&nbsp; issues involved" to&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations.<br><br>That these elements are present in the instant case, can not be disputed.&nbsp; As the respondent court has said, "The dispute in the instant case refers to minimum wages for&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petitioning union&nbsp; claim that deductions from their wages had been made in violation of the Mini mum Wage Law and consequently, the&nbsp; wages&nbsp; were&nbsp; reduced below&nbsp; the statutory&nbsp; limit."&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; incident which really affects the minimum&nbsp; wages to which union members&nbsp; are entitled, and the court called upon to deter mine it is certainly the Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; This is more so in this&nbsp; case where the parties have already fixed the conditions of employment in a collective&nbsp; bargaining agreement entered into&nbsp; between&nbsp; them&nbsp; and the question that arises&nbsp; is whether said conditions&nbsp; had&nbsp; been complied with.&nbsp; And this Court has already ruled that the Court of Industrial Relations has the exclusive jurisdiction&nbsp; to enforce collective bargaining contracts&nbsp; (Panbujon Sur United&nbsp; Mine&nbsp; Workers&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Samar&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Co., Inc.,&nbsp; 94 Phil., 932; 50 Off. Gaz., [6] 2449).&nbsp; This conclusion is also in line with what this Court has said in another case with regard to the extent of jurisdiction of the industrial&nbsp; court.<br><blockquote>"But this board jurisdiction (of the Court of Industrial Relations under Commonwealth&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 163) was somewhat curtailed upon the approval of&nbsp; Republic Act 875, the purpose being to limit it to certain specific cases, leaving the rest to the&nbsp; regular courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, as the law now stands, that&nbsp; power is confined&nbsp; to&nbsp; the following cases:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; when the&nbsp; labor&nbsp; dispute affects an industry which is indispensable&nbsp; to the national interest&nbsp; and is so&nbsp; certified by the President, to the industrial court&nbsp; (Section&nbsp; 10, Republic Act&nbsp; 875); (2) when the controversy refers to minimum&nbsp; wage&nbsp; under the Minimum Wage Law (Republic Act 602); (3)&nbsp; when it involves&nbsp; hours of employment under&nbsp; the Eight-Hour Labor Law&nbsp; (Commonwealth Act 444); and (4) when it involves an unfair labor practice (Section 5, (a), Republic&nbsp; Act 875)."&nbsp; (Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions, et al. <i>vs.</i> Hon. Bienvenido A. Tan, et al.,&nbsp; 99 Phil., 854; 52 Off. Gaz., [13] 5836; Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>With respect to&nbsp; the second point,&nbsp; it is true that&nbsp; with regard to&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; underpayment&nbsp; of&nbsp; wages, the law provides that the same should be brought to the proper court of first instance and not&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations [Section 16 (a), Republic Act 602], but the&nbsp; present dispute does not merely involve an underpayment&nbsp; but the propriety of the deductions made by petitioner from the wages of its employees for sundry facilities extended to them.&nbsp; Since&nbsp; these&nbsp; deductions&nbsp; may&nbsp; affect&nbsp; the&nbsp; minimum wages which said employees may be&nbsp; entitled, the incident evidently&nbsp; comes under the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations.<br><br>We&nbsp; agree with the claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner that&nbsp; whenever the Secretary of Labor endorses a dispute to the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; concerning&nbsp; a&nbsp; demand&nbsp; for&nbsp; minimum wage which involves an actual strike, the same should be acted upon by the&nbsp; court&nbsp; <i>en banc</i> as&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; by law [Section 16&nbsp; (c), Republic Act 602], but this claim is now of no consequence it appearing that the decision of Judge Bautista was affirmed by the court <i>en&nbsp; banc</i>.<br><br>Finally, the claim that under Section 7 of Republic Act 875 the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations has&nbsp; already been divested&nbsp; of its power&nbsp; to take cognizance of other issues involved&nbsp; in a dispute concerning demand for&nbsp; minimum wages under Section 16 (c) of the Minimum Wage Law because&nbsp; said Section 7&nbsp; provides that "No&nbsp; court of the Philippines shall have the power to set wages, rates of pay, hours of&nbsp; employment or&nbsp; conditions of employment", is untenable for&nbsp; the same overlooks the fact that said section contains&nbsp; an&nbsp; exception insofar as minimum wages and over time payments are concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is inferred from the following clause of said&nbsp; Section 7: "except as in this Act is otherwise provided&nbsp; and except as&nbsp; is&nbsp; provided in Re public Act&nbsp; Numbered&nbsp; Six Hundred&nbsp; Two and&nbsp; Common wealth Act Numbered&nbsp; Four&nbsp; Hundred Forty-Four as to hours of&nbsp; work."<br><br>Wherefore, petition&nbsp; is denied, with costs&nbsp; against petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
