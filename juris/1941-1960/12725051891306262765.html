				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Nita Flores has applied for a writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> to recover the possession of her daughter Asuncion Cruz, from respondent&nbsp; Felisa V. Cruz, who, it is claimed, refuses to surrender said minor to&nbsp; her aforementioned mother.<p>Asuncion&nbsp; Cruz was born outside wedlock, on May&nbsp; 25, 1939. Since then Asuncion had lived continuously with&nbsp; her mother, petitioner herein.&nbsp; In July, 1954, when the latter was staying at No.&nbsp; 14&nbsp; South 10 Street,&nbsp; Diliman,&nbsp; Quezon City, in the house of one Dr. Silva, under&nbsp; whose employment she&nbsp; had.been,&nbsp; and still&nbsp; is, seemingly, as housemaid, petitioner sent Asuncion to her paternal&nbsp; grandmother,&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Felisa V. Cruz, residing&nbsp; at No. 21 K-2 Street, Kamuning, Quezon City, in order to keep&nbsp; her away from a given suitor.&nbsp; About a&nbsp; month later, when petitioner bade Asuncion&nbsp; to return to their&nbsp; house,&nbsp; respondent allegedly did&nbsp; not permit it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; this&nbsp; case was instituted in October, 1954, in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Rizal.</p><p>Respondent testified&nbsp; that Asuncion lives freely&nbsp; in&nbsp; her (respondent's) house and is neither deprived of her liberty nor prevented from returning to her mother, if she (Asuncion) wants to do so.&nbsp; This was corroborated by Asuncion herself.&nbsp; It&nbsp; thus appearing that said minor is&nbsp; under no restraint&nbsp; of any kind&nbsp; whatsoever, the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court dismissed the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the resolution to this effect, petitioner seasonably appealed directly to this Court.&nbsp; Although her brief contests the truth of some of the statements made in said resolution, the substantial accuracy of the facts (as&nbsp; distinguished from the conclusions)&nbsp; therein set forth is impliedly admitted by appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; effect, therefore, the appeal raises merely questions of law.</p><p>The issue is whether a writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas&nbsp; corpus</span> lies when a minor voluntarily decides to stay in a&nbsp; house other than that&nbsp; of the person entitled&nbsp; to her&nbsp; custody and&nbsp; refuses to live&nbsp; with the latter.&nbsp; This question has already been settled in&nbsp; the&nbsp; affirmative.&nbsp; In Salvaña <em>vs.</em> Gaeta&nbsp; (55 Phil., 680), this Court after&nbsp; invoking the&nbsp; precedent established in Reyes&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Alvarez (8 Phil, 723) said:</p><p>"In the case of In re Swall&nbsp; (Ann. Cas. 1915B, pp. 1015, 1016), decided on July 15, 1913, by the Supreme Court of Nevada, the&nbsp; court said:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;'If the contention of counsel for petitioners is&nbsp; correct, that they are entitled to the custody of their minor child by&nbsp; virtue of the mere&nbsp; fact that they are his natural parents&nbsp; and are not shown otherwise to be improper persons to be intrusted with&nbsp; the custody of such minor, petitioners&nbsp; should prevail unless there is something in the contention of respondents that they are not holding said minor&nbsp; under any physical&nbsp; restraint.&nbsp; In this, as in probably&nbsp; most cases&nbsp; where a&nbsp; minor is abiding with persons who as&nbsp; to him are in <span style="font-style: italic;">loco parentis,</span>&nbsp; no physical restraint&nbsp; is necessary, for the natural inclination of the child does away with any necessity of force.&nbsp; But where, as in this case, a&nbsp; right&nbsp; to the possession of the minor is claimed, the right&nbsp; to retain such possession by such&nbsp; force as may be necessary may&nbsp; be assumed and that, if necessary, it would be exercised.&nbsp; Proceedings in&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> habeas corpus</span> have not&nbsp; frequently been reported to determine the&nbsp; right&nbsp; to the possession of a minor that the question of&nbsp; physical restraint need be given little or no consideration where a lawful right is asserted to retain possession of the child.'&nbsp; <p>"The fact, then, that&nbsp; a minor daughter&nbsp; is in the custody&nbsp; of a third&nbsp; person of her own&nbsp; free will, and without said person's having the slightest intention&nbsp; of detaining her,&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; hindrance to the issuance of a writ&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> to enable her parents to regain custody of&nbsp; her person."</p></blockquote><p>To&nbsp; the same effect are our decisions in Celis <em>vs.</em> Cafuir (47 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [Supp. 12]&nbsp; p. 179)&nbsp; and&nbsp; Chu&nbsp; Tian&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Tan Niu G. R. No. L-7509, August 25, 1954).&nbsp; . Said four (4) cases are squarely in point.&nbsp; They are conclusive on the issue&nbsp; before&nbsp; us.</p><p>We are not unmindful of the fact that, in dismissing the present case, His&nbsp; Honor,&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; was,&nbsp; seemingly influenced by the circumstance that Asuncion does not want to&nbsp; return to her&nbsp; mother,&nbsp; because the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; wants her (Asuncion)&nbsp; to be&nbsp; a maid of the aforementioned Dr. Silva. Considering,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; poor,&nbsp; that she herself was,&nbsp; and is, a maid&nbsp; of Dr. Silva, and that nothing dishonest or immoral appears to be&nbsp; connected&nbsp; with such work, we see nothing wrong in said wish of the petitioner. Furthermore, said&nbsp; wish&nbsp; is not&nbsp; even&nbsp; comparable to&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged behaviour&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; in the&nbsp; cases above referred&nbsp; to. </p><p>Thus, for instance, the case of Alvarez <em>vs.</em> Reyes (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>), involved&nbsp; a girl whose&nbsp; parents left her in a convent when&nbsp; she&nbsp; was&nbsp; two and one-half years of age.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirteen years&nbsp; later, the parents sought&nbsp; to obtain her&nbsp; custody by a writ&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span>.&nbsp; In&nbsp; granting the same although it appeared that the Mother Superior of the Convent had&nbsp; no objection thereto and that the child, then fifteen (15) years&nbsp; old,&nbsp; was&nbsp; unwilling&nbsp; to&nbsp; return to&nbsp; the parental&nbsp; home—this Court held:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The guardianship which parents&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; over their children by virtue of&nbsp; the paternal authority granted them by law has for its purpose their physical development, the cultivation of their intelligence,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; development&nbsp; of their intellectual&nbsp; and&nbsp; sensitive&nbsp; faculties.&nbsp; For such purposes&nbsp; they are&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; control&nbsp; their children and to keep them in their company in order to properly comply with their paternal obligations, but it is also their duty to furnish them with a dwelling or a place where they may live together.</p>&nbsp;"Although the right of. the parents may be expressly or tacitly waived, under no consideration can there be a waiver of their duty without violating the provisions of the law, as may be seen from the simple reading thereof.&nbsp; It is, therefore,&nbsp; not possible to prove that the parents of Valentina Reyes&nbsp; had waived, nor&nbsp; could they waive,&nbsp; the duty to support, instruct, educate, and to&nbsp; keep her with them, from the moment when they have expressed their will to take her out of the convent where she has resided for thirteen years. They can not be denied the right to recover their daughter, and with the greater reason, when it appears that the mother superior of said convent has not shown her intention to retain the girl&nbsp; therein."</blockquote><p>The&nbsp; case of Salvaña <em>vs.</em> Gaeta&nbsp; (<em>supra</em>) referred to&nbsp; another girl who abandoned her home and found asylum in the&nbsp; house of the&nbsp; local justice of the&nbsp; peace, alleging&nbsp; that her&nbsp; parents had maltreated her and were compelling&nbsp; her to marry a man she did&nbsp; not love.&nbsp; Despite the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that she&nbsp; was&nbsp; already pregnant, in consequence of illicit relations with another lad whom she&nbsp; wanted to marry, and that said justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; peace had never&nbsp; curtailed&nbsp; her liberty,&nbsp; we&nbsp; declared:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;"(1) That the writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> is the proper legal remedy to enable parents to regain the custody of a minor daughter, even though the latter be in the custody of a third person of her&nbsp; own free will; and; (2) that neither the fact that the parents of a minor daughter sought to compel her&nbsp; to' marry against&nbsp; her will, where it does hot appear such a&nbsp; purpose has continued, nor their refusal to consent, to her marriage to another young&nbsp; man, by whom she is pregnant, is a legal ground for depriving said parents of their parental&nbsp; authority and the custody of said daughter."</blockquote><p>The position of petitioner-appellant&nbsp; in the case at&nbsp; bar is much stronger&nbsp; than that of the petitioners in the&nbsp; (2) two cases already adverted&nbsp; to.&nbsp; Indeed, the former&nbsp; had always had the custody of her daughter, unlike the petitioners in the Alvarez case, who had left their daughter, for 13 years, under the care of a religious institution.&nbsp; Again, petitioner herein is not guilty of any of&nbsp; the acts imputed to the petitioners in the Salvaña case.</p><p>Despite the commendable concern displayed by the lower court for the welfare of Asuncion Cruz, it is incontestable that a denial&nbsp; of the writ&nbsp; prayed for by&nbsp; petitioner herein would defeat the parental authority vested by law in&nbsp; her (Article 316,&nbsp; Civil Code of the Philippines).&nbsp; Obviously, such result—which amounts to a deprivation of said&nbsp; authority—can not be countenanced except in the cases&nbsp; authorized by law&nbsp; (see Articles 327 to 332,&nbsp; Civil Code of the&nbsp; Philippines)&nbsp; and. this not one of them.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolution appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; reversed and the writ&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; for granted, without special&nbsp; pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
