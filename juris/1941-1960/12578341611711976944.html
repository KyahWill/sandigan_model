				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition under Rule 67 for writs of certiorari and mandamus to 
annul an order of the Court of First Instance of Oriental Mindoro denying his 
petition for appointment of a receiver in civil case No. R-802 and to compel the 
court to appoint one.
<p>In a verified complaint dated 9 July 1958 filed in the Court of First 
Instance of Oriental Mindoro, Lauro P. Leviste, the petitioner, seeks to recover 
from the respondents possession of a parcel of land situated at barrio 
Ina-rawan, municipality of Naujan, province of Oriental Mindoro, Lot No. 5013, 
Cad-200-Ext., S. A. No. 22196, containing an area of 132 hectares, 26 areas and 
83 centares, covered by original certificate of title No. P-706, issued in his 
name upon a patent by the Registrar of Deeds of Oriental Mindoro; to secure a 
judicial declaration that he is the owner of the plants and trees sown or 
planted and buildings constructed thereon in bad faith by the respondents; to 
collect the sums of P12,000 as actual damages for the value of the crops that he 
had failed to gather or harvest as a result of the respondents' unlawful 
occupation of the parcel of land, P35,000 as moral damages, P3,300 as expenses 
of litigation including attorney's fee, incurred by the petitioner in defending 
his rights thereto in the administrative case commenced by the respondents, and 
P3,500 as expenses of litigation including attorney's fee, incurred by him in 
this suit. The petitioner further prayed for the appointment of a receiver, 
preferably Gabriel Fernandez of Inarawan, Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, of the 
"crops, plants and improvements sown and/or planted, or otherwise constructed." 
(Annex A.) The respondents an answer to the complaint with a counterclaim of 
P15,000 as moral damages, P900 for attorney's fee and for "expenses M litigation 
(Annex B). On 16 August 1958 the respondent court denied the petitioner's motion 
for appointment of a receiver (Annex C). The petitioner moved for 
reconsideration of the foregoing order (Annex D). On 4 November 1958 the 
respondent court denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration (Annex 
E).</p>
<p>The petitioner claims and contends that the respondent court graveljr abused 
its discretion in denying his petition for appointment of a receiver and that he 
has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of 
law.</p>
<p>A receiver of property in litigation may be appointed by a competent court 
where the action is pending "When it appears from the complaint or answer, and 
such other proof as the judge may require, that the party applying for the 
appointment of receiver has an interest in the property or fund willed is the 
subject of the action, and that such property or fund is in danger of being 
lost, removed, or materially injured unless a receiver be appointed to guard and 
preserve it," or "Whenever in other cases it appears that the appointment of a 
receiver is the most convenient and feasible means of preserving, administering, 
or disposing of the property in litigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The appointment of a receiver largely lies 
in the discretion of the court to which application is made;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and should be made only when there is no 
other means by which the rights of the petitioner could be protected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Just as a writ of preliminary injunction 
should not be issued to put a party in possession of the property in litigation 
and to deprive another party who is in possession thereof, except in a very 
clear case of evident usurpation, so also a receiver should not be appointed to 
deprave a party who is in possession of the property in litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In an action for ejectment where there is 
no claim on the crops, a receiver cannot be appointed to take charge of the 
crops.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Conversely, where the fruits of 
the land are claimed, a receiver thereof may be appointed, but such power should 
be sparingly used.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p>Bearing in mind the foregoing rules evolved by this Court on receivership, it 
is difficult to conceive how the respondent court may be held to have gravely 
abused its discretion in denying the petitioner's motion for appointment of a 
receiver. In his complaint the petitioner avers that sometime in 1955 the 
respondents entered upon the parcel of land without previous authority from him 
and over the objection of his overseer, and cultivated it. One of the remedies 
he prays is that he be declared owner of the crops, plants and trees sown or 
planted and buildings constructed thereon in bad faith by the respondents. In 
their answer, the respondents claim that since 1951 they have been in actual 
possession and occupation of the parcel of land when it was still virgin forest 
and that believing that it was of the public domain, they made clearings thereon 
for the purpose of cultivation without molestation from no one. As the good 
faith or bad faith of the respondents is yet to be determined by the respondent 
court, the status of the parties in relation to the crops plants, trees and 
buildings sown and erected thereon should not be disturbed until after the case 
shall have been fully decided.</p>
<p>The writs prayed for are denied, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
