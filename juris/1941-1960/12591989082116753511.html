				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Johanna Hofer Borromeo, widow of the late Dr. Maximo Borromeo who died&nbsp; on July 31, 1948,&nbsp; brought this action alleging (1) that during her marriage&nbsp; with the deceased, the latter bought a certain real property situated in Cebu, this property becoming&nbsp; one of the conjugal properties of her husband and herself;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that in June,&nbsp; 1948, before his death and at the time when he was seriously ill and bedridden, her husband signed, or was&nbsp; made to sign,&nbsp; a fictitious deed of sale of said property in favor of Dr. Venustiano H. J. Borromeo and Dr.&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; C. Borromeo purporting to convey said property to them for P3,000; (3) that the property was assessed at P42,480 and had a market value of P80.000,&nbsp; and there was a&nbsp; mortgage thereon of P125,000 in favor of&nbsp; the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation ; (4) that the sale was fictitious,&nbsp; as no payment of the stated price was made, and the&nbsp; price stared was in adequate; (5) that defendants took possession of the property in bad faith and&nbsp; deprived plaintiff&nbsp; and the estate of the deceased of the fruits and rentals&nbsp; amounting to not less than P100 a month, and praying that the sale be declared null and void, and the registration of&nbsp; the sale and the title issued to them be cancelled.&nbsp; The complaint includes Canuto C. Borromeo, executor of the estate of the deceased husband, for the alleged&nbsp; reason that he refuses to join.as party plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendants moved to dismiss&nbsp; the&nbsp; action on three grounds, (1)&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff has no legal capacity to&nbsp; sue; (2) that the complaint states no cause of&nbsp; action; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that the action&nbsp; is premature. The&nbsp; trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the interest of the wife in the community property is a mere expectancy, which&nbsp; does not ripen into a&nbsp; legal title, until a liquidation has been had of the conjugal partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; against&nbsp; the order of dismissal&nbsp; that, the appeal to this Court is&nbsp; prosecuted.<br><br>The decision appealed from cites the case of Nable Jose <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Nable Jose,. 41 Phil., 718, as authority for dismissing the action.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this Court the appellees also invoke our decisions in the cases of Baello <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Villanueva, 54 Phil, 213, and De la Cruz <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Buenaventura, et al., 46 Off. Gaz., No. 12, p. 6032.&nbsp; But the principles decided in the above&nbsp; eases are not applicable to the case at bar because&nbsp; the facts involved are&nbsp; entirely&nbsp; different.&nbsp; In&nbsp; Nable&nbsp; Jose <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Nable Jose, the question involved was. the rights of the heirs of the deceased wife to the conjugal property pending liquidation thereof by the husband as administrator.&nbsp; Clearly the heirs of the deceased wife have no direct title or&nbsp; interest in the communal property as such, until a liquidation is made and the net&nbsp; remainder is distributed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case of Baello <i>vs.</i> Villanueva, et al., a donation&nbsp; of&nbsp; conjugal property was&nbsp; made by the deceased husband to the grands children&nbsp; of&nbsp; a brother,&nbsp; so we held that while the gift is illegal, the action for its&nbsp; illegality&nbsp; can be brought by the wife only alter&nbsp; the&nbsp; liquidation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; conjugal&nbsp; partnership, if she is prejudiced&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; donation,&nbsp; because the illegal gilt should be charged against the husband donor and deducted from his capital pursuant to Article 1419 of the old Civil&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; The prejudice can be,&nbsp; ascertained&nbsp; only after&nbsp; liquidation, so an action to&nbsp; annul the gift before liquidation is premature.&nbsp; In the De la Cruz<i> vs.</i> Buenaventura, et al., case, the sale sought to be annulled was alleged to be "fictitious and fraudulent",, but this Court overlooked the allegation of fictitiousness and merely&nbsp; considered the contract&nbsp; as&nbsp; "illegal and fraudulent", void only if&nbsp; it would exceed the amount which the husband&nbsp; would be&nbsp; entitled to upon&nbsp; liquidation.&nbsp; It was, therefore, decided that the case fell under the&nbsp; second paragraph of Article&nbsp; 1413 of. the old Civil Code, and that the action would lie only after the liquidation&nbsp; of the conjugal&nbsp; partnership.<br><br>The case which most&nbsp; resembles the case now under consideration is that of Pascual <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Pascual, 73 Phil.,&nbsp; 561.&nbsp; In that case the&nbsp; sale sought&nbsp; to be annulled by the wife was made&nbsp; by the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; husband during his lifetime&nbsp; <i>without consideration.</i>&nbsp; We&nbsp; said that as the sale is alleged to be <i>fictitious, with absolutely no consideration</i>, it should be regarded as <i>non-existent, not merely annullable.</i><br><blockquote>"El concepto&nbsp; de&nbsp; la&nbsp; causa falsa se confunde por&nbsp; lo relacionadoa que estan, con el de la simulacion, segun&nbsp; advertimos comentando el articulo 1.265 y por tanto,&nbsp; a&nbsp; este precepto, o Sea&nbsp; al 1.276, y&nbsp; a sua concordantes, habra de referirse la solucion en nuestro derecho acerca de la simulacion.&nbsp; Reconociendo' esta analogia tiene declarado la Jurisprudencia que los contratos simulados, o sea celebrados con causa falsa, no confieren dcrechos ni puedert surtir efecto alguno legal (sentencias de 31 de Octubre de 1865 y 21 de" Marzo de 1884), y en la de 23 de Noviembre de 1877 esta declarado que ''la&nbsp; simulaeion de un contrato Heva consigo neeesariamente la falsedad&nbsp; de&nbsp; la causa del mismo, y pueden alegarla&nbsp; todos aquellos a'quienes interese, salva la jesponsibilidad que en su&nbsp; caso eontraigan."&nbsp; De estas&nbsp; declarapiones muy importantes, de la jurisprudencia, se deduce&nbsp; la ineficacia total de l'os' contratos con&nbsp; causa falsa, que, corao expresion del criterio segnido&nbsp; en el derecho&nbsp; anterior al Codig-o Civil, no quedc&nbsp; aplicarse a contratos bajo el imperio&nbsp; de este, aunque si&nbsp; a los anteriores; pero&nbsp; en lo&nbsp; demas,&nbsp; eomo&nbsp; no se oponeh&nbsp; al&nbsp; articulo 1,276,&nbsp; que solo contradice&nbsp; aquella&nbsp; ineficacia.&nbsp; afoosluta,&nbsp; sirven&nbsp; para expresar la relacion de la simulacion eon&nbsp; la causa falsa&nbsp; y&nbsp; para regular&nbsp; el ejercicio de la accion de&nbsp; nulidad fundada&nbsp; en esta, puntp&nbsp; del&nbsp; eual trataremos mas&nbsp; adelante."&nbsp; .(Manresa, Cwdigo Civil Espanol,&nbsp; Tomo 8, paginas 623-623.)<br></blockquote>In the case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar the sale is alleged to be fictitious because no payment of the stated price was made.&nbsp; The sale therefore,&nbsp; was non-existent,&nbsp; because one of the elements, that of&nbsp; consideration,&nbsp; was&nbsp; absent.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; such&nbsp; effect is Article 1261 of the old Civil Code which&nbsp; provides:<br><ol type="1">"There is no contract unless the following requisites&nbsp; exist:<br><br><li>&nbsp;The consent&nbsp; of the contracting parties;<br><br></li><li>&nbsp;A definite object which is the subject-matter of&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract;<br><br></li><li>A consideration for the&nbsp; obligation established."</li></ol>The&nbsp; theory&nbsp; that&nbsp; the right&nbsp; of the widow to&nbsp; contest the simulated&nbsp; sale arises only after the liquidation of the conjugal partnership,&nbsp; is&nbsp; based&nbsp; on&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1413&nbsp; of&nbsp; the old Civil Code, which provides:<br><blockquote>"In addition to his powers as&nbsp; manager the husband may&nbsp; for&nbsp; a valuable consideration alienate&nbsp; and encumber the property of the conjugal partnership without the consent of the wife.<br><br>"Nevertheless, no alienation or&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; which the husband may make "with&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to such&nbsp; property in1 contravention of&nbsp; this code or in fraud&nbsp; of the wife shall prejudice her or her heirs."<br></blockquote>It will be noted from&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; Article that the husband, as the administrator, is given the power to dispose of conjugal property under&nbsp; onerous title without the consent of the wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; second paragraph this power is&nbsp; limited by the reservation that the wife's rights will not be prejudicated by the assignment or sale made by the husband, when the said assignment or agreement violates the provisions of the Code or is in fraud of the&nbsp; rights of the wife. The instances,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; to which said paragraph two refers are those eases of sales, conveyances&nbsp; or assignments which have, been made tvnder onerous title&nbsp; in violation of the provision of the Code or in fraud of the rights of the wife.&nbsp; Said contracts or agreements have the three essential requisites of contracts, namely,&nbsp; consent of the parties, subject-matter and consideration, although&nbsp; they are subject to annullment because they violate the provisions of the Code or are in fraud of the rights of the wife.&nbsp; These kinds of conveyances or contracts&nbsp; must be distinguished from those in which&nbsp; no consideration&nbsp; exists,&nbsp; as already pointed out above; in these latter&nbsp; cases, the contracts or agreements lack one of the&nbsp; essential elements for their validity,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; cause or consideration, and,&nbsp; therefore, they are considered as non-existent.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is under this category&nbsp; (of non-existent&nbsp; contracts)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; fictitious sale, alleged in the case at bar to have been executed by the husband without consideration or with false&nbsp; consideration, falls.&nbsp; In other words, in accordance&nbsp; with the allegations of the complaint filed the simulated sale has nonexistent,&nbsp; because there was no consideration for the execution thereof.&nbsp; The sale executed by the deceased husband was not&nbsp; sale by onerous title, executed in violation of the provisions of the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; or in&nbsp; fraud of&nbsp; the rights of the wife; if it was not a sale or conveyance which suffers from invalidity by&nbsp; reason of&nbsp; the violation of the provisions of the Code or of fraud&nbsp; to the rights&nbsp; of the wife.&nbsp; It is, according to the allegations of the complaint, a non-existent contract&nbsp; which never came into&nbsp; being&nbsp; or effect because of the express provision of Article 1261&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Civil Code. As the deed of sale&nbsp; executed by the&nbsp; deceased husband was, according&nbsp; to the allegations of the complaint, without consideration because the supposed price did not&nbsp; exist and was not paid, it follows that the sale&nbsp; is not the one contemplated by the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 1413 of the old Civil Code, and it is not, therefore, correct to hold that the right of the wife to assail its effectiveness Is made to depend upon the outcome of the liquidation of the conjugal&nbsp; partnership.&nbsp; The case at&nbsp; bar falls clearly under&nbsp; the principle stated in&nbsp; the case of Pascual <i>vs.</i> Pascual, supra, where the wife, who had an interest in the conjugal property subject of the sale, was allowed to bring the action, making the executor a party-defendant because of Ma refusal to institute the&nbsp; suit.<br><br>In view of the foregoing considerations,&nbsp; the order dismissing the complaint is&nbsp; hereby reversed&nbsp; and "fee&nbsp; case remanded to the Court of First Instance of Cebu for further proceedings.&nbsp; With costs against the defendants-appellees.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
