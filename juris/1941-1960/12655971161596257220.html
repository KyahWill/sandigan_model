				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed in the above entitled case on July 
13, 1946, assailed the validity of the judgment of the Court of Appeals which 
affirmed in December, 1942, the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Tayabas against the petitioners, on the ground that the judgment rendered by the 
Court of Appeals during the Japanese occupation was null and void, because the 
question involved in the litigation was the validity or invalidity of a free 
patent issued by the Governor General of the Philippines under the authority 
granted by an Act of Congress of the United States; one of the parties in the 
case was the Director of Lands, as officer in charge with the administration and 
alienation of public lands placed under the control of the Government of the 
Philippines; and the petitioners were claiming vested rights, not only under the 
laws in force in the Philippines, but also under the Act of Congress of July 1, 
1902. The decision of the Court of Appeals was also attacked as being in 
violation of the fundamental right of the petitioners, for the reason that the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance of Tayabas did not contain findings of 
facts, that is, whether or not there was fraud in obtaining the free patent in 
question, and the Court of Appeals made its own findings of fact without hearing 
the appellants nor giving them opportunity to be heard on the questions of fact 
therein raised. And the petitioners prayed that the Court of First Instance of 
Tayabas, to which the case was remanded several years ago for the execution of 
the judgment by the Court of Appeals, be required to send the record of said 
case to this Court for consideration and decision.
<p>We dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in a minute resolution of 
August 14, 1946, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Considering the petition filed in G.R. No. L-718, Juliana Etorma et als., 
petitioners, <i>vs</i>. Lucila Ravelo et al., respondents, praying that the 
decision jointly rendered in the case referred to in the petition, as well as 
all the proceedings had in said cases after January 1, 1942, be declared null 
and void; that the Court of First Instance of Tayabas be required to send up the 
records of said cases, and that the appeal interposed by petitioners be 
considered and decided by this Court: it is ordered that the petition be 
dismissed."</p></blockquote>
<p>This Court did not deem it necessary to render a reasoned decision in 
deciding the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, for it considered the latter 
without merits. Because the decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 
December 22, 1942, which affirmed that of the Court of First Instance of 
Tayabas, has become final several years ago, and the judgments of the Courts in 
the Philippines during the Japanese occupation are valid and binding in 
accordance with the ruling of this Court in the case of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. 
Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (75 Phil., 113). The fact that the question involved 
was the validity of a free patent, and the Director of Public Lands was a party, 
and that the authority to grant free patent was conferred upon the Governor 
General, and the power to regulate the procedure to obtain it upon the 
Legislature of the Philippines by Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, did not make 
the judgment rendered thereon of political nature. The Acts authorizing and 
regulating the grant of free patents to occupants or possessors of public lands 
are municipal laws, and the judgments of the courts which apply said laws are 
not of political complexion.</p>
<p>Now the attorney for the petitioners alleges that the ruling or doctrine laid 
down in the said case of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon is not 
applicable to the present case, inasmuch as the petitioners herein had refused, 
by going up to the mountains, to submit themselves to the authority of the 
Japanese invaders and the government established by them in these Islands; and 
for that reason he now asks this Court to render a decision stating the reasons 
on which it is based, in accordance with section 12, Article VIII, of our 
Constitution.</p>
<p>The allegation that the petitioners had refused to submit themselves to the 
invaders was not set up in their petition for <i>certiorari</i>, and therefore 
could not properly be taken into consideration now for the purpose for which the 
present petition has been filed. But to meet this new contention, it is 
sufficient to state that the omission on the part of the petitioners or their 
attorney to take proper steps, if there were any, to withdraw the case appealed 
by them out of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, which was continued by 
the occupant during the Japanese regime, until the latter has rendered a 
decision against them, constituted an implied submission to the jurisdiction of 
the said court, and the fact admitted in the paragraph VI of their petition for 
<i>certiorari</i>, that after the attorney for the petitioner was notified of 
the decision of the Court of Appeals of December 22, 1942, he had filed a motion 
with the Court of Appeals asking that he be granted a period of time within 
which to file a motion for reconsideration of said decision, was an express 
submission to the said jurisdiction, since the acts of an attorney in all 
matters of ordinary judicial procedure bind his clients (section 21, Rule 127). 
The subsequent filing of "an exception or protest against the decision" of the 
Court of Appeals, instead of a motion for reconsideration, could not have the 
effect of a withdrawal by said petitioners from the court's jurisdiction; for a 
court does not lose its jurisdiction acquired over a party by the latter's 
subsequent refusal to recognize it, specially after the court has decided the 
case against him. To allow the petitioners to avoid the decision rendered 
against them by the Court of Appeals would be utterly untenable, for it stands 
to reason that they should not assail now the validity of said judgment had it 
been in their favor.</p>
<p>The dissenting opinion of Messrs. Justices Hilado and Perfecto is made to 
rest, not only upon the reasons set forth in their dissenting opinion in the 
case of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, <i>supra</i>, but 
principally on the proposition that, in deciding that the governments 
established in these Islands by the Japanese military forces of occupation, 
under the name of Philippine Executive Commission and the Republic of the 
Philippines, were <i>de facto</i> governments, this Court attempted to exercise 
a power which exclusively belonged to the political departments of the United 
States and the Commonwealth Government; because according to the Supreme Court 
of the United States in the case of Jones <i>vs</i>. U.S. (137 U.S., 202; 34 
Law. ed., 691, 696), the question "Who is the sovereign, <i>de jure</i> or <i>de 
facto</i> of a territory is not a judicial, but a political question, the 
determination of which by the legislative and executive departments of any 
government conclusively binds the judges, as well as other officers and subjects 
of the Government." And after citing said excerpt of the decision, the said 
dissenting opinion says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to the doctrine just quoted, the first question to be determined 
by the legislative and executive departments of the government is: Who is the 
sovereign of the territory? The next is: Is he a <i>de jure</i> or <i>de 
facto</i> sovereign? The determination of this second question necesarily 
decides whether the government of that sovereign is <i>de jure</i> or <i>de 
facto</i>, for it is not possible to speak of a sovereign in the instant 
acceptation of the term, without linking him with his government. And a <i>de 
jure</i> sovereign cannot have a <i>de facto</i> government, any more than a 
<i>de facto</i> sovereign have a <i>de jure government</i>. * * * Differently 
expressed, the proposition would be: If the question of who is the sovereign, 
<i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, of a territory is not a judicial, but a 
political question, that of whether the government in the territory is <i>de 
jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, cannot but be a political 
question."</p></blockquote>
<p>This new ground is predicated upon the clearly erroneous assumption that the 
determination of the question whether a government is <i>de facto</i> or <i>de 
jure</i> involves necessarily the question of sovereignty. It is correct that a 
government established in a territory under a sovereign <i>de jure</i> is a 
government <i>de jure</i>, but it is not true that a government established in a 
territory under a sovereign <i>de jure</i> cannot be a government <i>de 
facto</i>. The three classes of governments <i>de facto</i> set forth in the 
decision of this Court in the case of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and 
Dizon and recognized by all the publicist and decisions of the Supreme Court of 
the United States, are governments <i>de facto</i> established in a territory 
which continued under the same sovereign <i>de jure</i>, or in which there was 
no change of sovereignty. In the said case of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan 
Keh and Dizon, this Court said: "There are several kinds of <i>de facto</i> 
governments. The first, or goverment <i>de facto</i> in a proper legal sense, is 
that government that gets possession and control of, or usurps, by force or by 
the voice of the majority, the rightful legal government and maintains itself 
against the will of the latter, such as the government of England under the 
Commonwealth, first by Parliament and later by Cromwell as Protector. The second 
is that which is established and maintained by military forces who invade and 
occupy a territory of the enemy in the course of war, and which is denominated a 
government of paramount force, as the cases of Castine, in Maine, which was 
reduced to British possession in the war of 1812, and of Tampico, Mexico, 
occupied during the war with Mexico by the troops of the United States. And the 
third is that established as an independent government by the inhabitants of a 
country who rise in insurrection against the parent state, such as the 
government of the Southern Confederacy in revolt against the Union during the 
war of secession."</p>
<p>Were the theory advanced in the dissenting opinion correct, the decisions of 
the Supreme Court of the United States in the following cases in which it held 
that the governments in a territory temporarily occupied by the invading enemy 
forces during war, or set up by the insurgents during insurrection or rebellion, 
were <i>de facto</i> governments, would be also necessarily erroneous, and we do 
not think the dissenting Messrs. Justices Hilado and Perfecto mean to so hold. 
The Supreme Court of the United States held in the case of U.S. <i>vs</i>. Rice 
(4 Wheaton, 258), that the government established in Castine, Maine, occupied 
temporarily by the British forces in the war of 1812 was a <i>de facto</i> 
government. The same Court held in the case of Fleming <i>vs</i>. Page (9 How., 
614), that the government established by the American forces in Tampico, Mexico, 
during the war between the latter and United States was a <i>de facto</i> 
government. In the cases of Thorington <i>vs</i>. Smith (8 Wall., 1) ; Williams 
<i>vs</i>. Bruffy (95 U.S., 176 [quoting the decision in the case of Horn 
<i>vs</i>. Lockhert, 17 Wall., 570]), and Baldy <i>vs</i>. Hunter (171 U.S., 
388), it was held that the goverments set up by the Confederate States during 
the war of secession were <i>de facto</i> governments. And in the case of 
McCleod <i>vs</i>. United States (229 U.S., 416), the same Supreme Court of the 
United States held that the short-lived government established by Filipino 
insurgents in the Island of Cebu during the Spanish American War, was a <i>de 
facto</i> government.</p>
<p>The dissenting opinion further says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If President Roosevelt had considered the regime imposed upon this country 
by the Japanese occupation army as a <i>de facto</i> government, within the 
meaning of International Law, he would not have branded the 'Philippine 
Republic' as a 'puppet government', and, since he must be presumed to know that 
a <i>de facto</i> government in international law is a form of government, with 
powers and duties of its own, as contradistinguished from a mere 'puppet', and 
that such a government is entitled to recognition among civilized nations, he 
would never have so vehemently announced in his message to the Filipino people 
on October 23, 1943, that neither the one nor the other had the recognition or 
the sympathy of the government of the United States—he would not have condemned 
them.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"If President Quezon and the other Filipino leaders * * * had considered 
(said government) as not <i>de facto</i> government * * *," they would not have 
requested of the Senate and House of Representatives of Congress of the United 
States, the introduction of what later became S. J. Res. No. 93, which became 
law on June 29, 1944, wherein the government thus imposed upon the Filipinos by 
the Japanese's 'own puppet government which was <i>conceived in intrigue, born 
in coercion,</i> and reared <i>primarily</i> for the purpose of <i>Japanese 
selfishness and aggrandizement</i>.' "</p></blockquote>
<p>In reply to these remarks, suffice it to say that the President and Congress 
of the United States in describing and branding the Philippine Executive 
Commission and the so-called Republic of the Philippines as puppet governments, 
did not recognize them as legitimate or <i>de jure</i> governments, and not 
being <i>de jure</i> they are <i>de facto</i> governments under the rules of 
international law. An organized government established in a territory must be 
either <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, since there is no other class of 
organized government known in political as well as in international law. There 
is no genuine or false <i>de facto</i> government.</p>
<p>It is evidently erroneous to say that the majority "in laying down the 
doctrine in the Co Kim Cham case it has unwittingly refused to be bound by the 
aforesaid prior and adverse determination of the United States and Commonwealth 
governments." The decision of this Court in the case of Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. 
Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon is precisely in conformity with the previous 
determination of the above mentioned message of President Roosevelt and 
resolution and Act of Congress of the United States, in which the so-called 
Republic of the Philippines was branded as "a puppet government, which was 
conceived in intrigue and born in coercion" that is, not a government <i>de 
jure</i>. We have held in the said case of Co Kim Cham that "The so-called 
Republic of the Philippines, apparently established and organized as a sovereign 
state independent from any other government by the Filipino people, was, in 
truth and reality, a government established by the belligerent occupant or the 
Japanese forces of occupation. It was of the same character as the Philippine 
Executive Commission, and the ultimate source of its authority was the same—the 
Japanese military authority and government. As General MacArthur stated in his 
proclamation of October 23, 1944, a portion of which has been already quoted, 
'under enemy duress, a so-called government styled as the "Republic of the 
Philippines" was established on October 14, 1943, based upon neither the free 
expression of the people's will nor the sanction of the Government of the United 
States.' Japan had no legal power to grant independence to the Philippines or 
transfer the sovereignty of the United States to, or recognize the latent 
sovereignty of, the Filipino people, before its military occupation and 
possession of the Islands had matured into an absolute and permanent dominion or 
sovereignty by a treaty of peace or other means recognized in the law of 
nations."</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion that the governments of the Philippine Executive 
Commission and the so-called Republic of the Philippines were now governments 
<i>de facto</i>, because they were not recognized and were called puppet 
governments by the executive and legislative departments of the United States, 
is untenable, for it is premised upon a wrong conception of what a government 
<i>de facto</i> is. It is evident that if said governments established in the 
Philippines had been recognized by the executive and legislative departments of 
the United States, they would have been <i>de jure</i> and not <i>de facto</i> 
governments; and they were called puppet governments because they were not 
established by legitimate sovereign, but they were governments <i>de facto</i>. 
It is simply gratuitous to state that "It goes without saying that a puppet 
government is no government at all, not even a <i>de facto</i> government." A 
puppet government is one that acts as another wills or dictates. The Republic of 
the Philippines was a puppet government, because although set up apparently as a 
free and independent government, was, in truth and in fact, a government <i>de 
facto</i> established by the belligerent occupant or the Japanese military 
forces, as we have already stated in the case of Co Kim Cham above quoted.</p>
<p>And as to what may be considered as territory occupied by the enemy, and Mr. 
Justice Hilado's contention that the laws of international law relating to 
government <i>de facto</i> over territory occupied by Japan are not applicable, 
because the latter started treacherously against the United States, we may quote 
the following from our resolution on the motion for reconsideration filed in 
said case of Co Kim Cham:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) It is contended that the military occupation of the Philippine Islands 
by the Japanese was not actual and effective because of the existence of 
guerrilla bands in barrios and mountains and even towns and villages; and 
consequently, no government <i>de facto</i> could have been validly established 
by the Japanese military forces in the Philippines under the precepts of the 
Hague Conventions and the law of nations.</p>
<p>"The presence of guerrilla bands in barrios and mountains, and even in towns 
of the Philippines whenever these towns were left by Japanese garrisons or by 
the detachments of troops sent on patrol to these places, was not sufficient to 
make the military occupation ineffective, nor did it cause that occupation to 
cease, or prevent the constitution or establishment of a <i>de facto</i> 
government in the Islands. The belligerent occupation of the Philippines by the 
Japanese invaders became an accomplished fact from the time General Wainright, 
Commander of the American and Filipino forces in Luzon, and General Sharp, 
Commander of the forces in Visayas and Mindanao, surrendered and ordered the 
surrender of their forces to the Japanese invaders, and the Commonwealth 
Government had become incapable of publicly exercising its authority, and the 
invader had substituted his own authority for that of the legitimate government 
in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.</p>
<p>" 'According to the rules of Land Warfare of the United States Army, 
belligerent or so-called military occupation is a question of fact. It 
presupposes a hostile invasion as a result of which the invader has rendered the 
invaded government incapable of publicly exercising its authority, and that the 
invader is in position to substitute and has substituted his own authority for 
that of the legitimate government of the territory invaded.' (International Law 
Chiefly as Interpreted and Applied by the United States, by Hyde, Vol. II, pp. 
361, 362.) 'Belligerent occupation must be both actual and effective. Organized 
resistance must be overcome and the forces in possession must have taken 
measures to establish law and order. It doubtless suffices if the occupying army 
can, within a reasonable time, send detachments of troops to make its authority 
felt within the occupied district.' (<i>Id</i>., p. 364.) 'Occupation once 
acquired must be maintained * * *. It does not cease, however, * * *. Nor does 
the existence of a rebellion or the operations of guerrilla bands cause it to 
cease, unless the legitimate government is reestablished and the occupant fails 
promptly to suppress such rebellion or guerrilla operations.' (<i>Id</i>., p. 
365.)</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"(2) It is submitted that the renunciation in our Constitution and in the 
Kellog-Briand Pact of war as an instrument of national policy, rendered 
inapplicable the rules of international law authorizing the belligerent Japanese 
army of occupation to set up a provisional or <i>de facto</i> government in the 
Philippines, because Japan started war treacherously and emphasized war as an 
instrument of national policy; and that to give validity to the judicial acts of 
courts sponsored by the Japanese would be tantamount to giving validity to the 
acts of these invaders, and would be nothing short of legalizing the Japanese 
invasion of the Philippines.</p>
<p>"In reply to this contention, suffice it to say that the provisions of the 
Hague Conventions which impose upon a belligerent occupant the duty to continue 
the courts as well as the municipal laws in force in the country unless 
absolutely prevented, in order to reestablish and insure '1'ordre et la vie 
publice,' that is, the public order and safety, and the entire social and 
commercial life of the country, were inserted, <i>not</i> for the benefit of the 
invader, but <i>for the protection and benefit of the people or inhabitants of 
the occupied territory and of those not in the military service, in order that 
the ordinary pursuits and business of society may not be unnecessarily 
deranged</i>.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"The fact that the belligerent occupant is a treacherous aggressor, as Japan 
was, does not, therefore, exempt him from complying with the said precepts of 
the Hague Conventions, nor does it make null and void the judicial acts of the 
courts continued by the occupant in the territory occupied. To deny validity to 
such judicial acts would benefit the invader or aggressor, who is presumed to be 
intent upon causing as much harm as possible to the inhabitants or nationals of 
the enemy's territory, and prejudice the latter; it would cause more suffering 
to the conquered and assist the conqueror or invader in realizing his nefarious 
design; in fine, it would result in penalizing the nationals of the occupied 
territory, and rewarding the invader or occupant for his acts of treachery and 
aggression." (75 Phil., 371.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The resolution above quoted which upholds the validity of judicial acts which 
are not of political complexion of <i>de facto</i> governments established by 
the military occupant in an enemy territory, is based on the Regulations of the 
Hague Convention that contain the generally accepted principles of International 
Law, adopted as a part of the law of the Nation in section 3 of our 
Constitution, and is supported by Dr. Lauterpacht in his 6th edition of 
Oppenheim, page 51, footnote, in which it is said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'In particular, the illegality of the war undertaken in breach of the 
provisions of the Pact does not automatically deprive the guilty belligerent of 
the rights of warfare, including those resulting from the law of neutrality.' 
(P. 157.) Subsequently he adds: 'For war waged in violation of the Treaty is 
nevertheless war conferring upon the guilty and innocent belligerents alike all 
the rights flowing from the accepted law of war and neutrality.' (P. 512.) He 
further declares: 'No authorization to disregard the duties of neutral 
impartiality against the State breaking the Treaty can be deduced from the 
passage in the preamble which lays down that "any signatory power which shall 
hereafter seek to promote its national interests by resort to war should be 
denied the benefits furnished by this Treaty." The benefits furnished by the 
Treaty are immunity from war waged as an instrument of national policy, not a 
guarantee of the observance of rules of International Law, including the rules 
of neutrality.' " (International Law by Hyde, p. 1684, Vol. III, Second Revised 
Edition.)</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the legal grounds stated in the well written dissenting 
opinion of Mr. Justice Hilado, concurred in by us, there are strong reasons of 
substantial justice and equity in support of the granting of the petition.</p>
<p>Petitioners alleged that they have refused to submit themselves to the 
invaders. The majority dismissed this contention by stating that it was not set 
up in the petition for certiorari and, at any rate, petitioners had impliedly 
submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals under the 
Japanese regime, when they failed to take proper steps to withdraw the case from 
said jurisdiction. But in the majority resolution itself it appears that 
petitioners filed "an exception or protest against the decision" of the Court of 
Appeals. To our mind, that pleading was more than enough to convey to any court 
or person petitioners' attitude of not recognizing the authority and 
jurisdiction of said court.</p>
<p>To ask for more is to ignore the prevailing realities created by the fearsome 
Japanese occupation. To require petitioners to be then and there more explicit 
about their attitude, by stating the grounds of their protest, is tantamount to 
expect petitioners to ogle suicide or invite self-destruction. If petitioners 
had alleged the reason for their refusal to recognize the jurisdiction of the 
Court of Appeals they would have stated that it was because they did not 
recognize the authority of the Japanese imperial government under which the 
court was instructed to function. The Japanese would not then have wasted any 
time to catch petitioners to torture and execute them in Ft. Santiago or in any 
of the many torture chambers or zoning camps established by the enemy all over 
the country. Petitioners used the word "protest" which was strong and reckless 
enough. Only self-delusion can obliterate seeing the far-reaching meaning of a 
"protest" uttered under the circumstances.</p>We vote to grant the 
petition.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>HILADO, J.,</strong> with whom concurs <strong>PERFECTO, 
J.:</strong></p>
<p>We dissent.</p>
<p>With all due respect to our brethren who maintain different views from ours 
upon the very vital legal questions involved herein, we feel constrained to 
dissent from the opinion of the majority. The opinion of our said brethren has 
been written by Mr. Justice Feria in the form of the foregoing resolution. Said 
opinion is predicated upon the doctrine, from which we also dissented, laid down 
in Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (75 Phil., 113). In 
registering this new dissent from that doctrine, we hope that our attitude will 
not be mistaken for systematic stubbornness for it is born solely of a deep 
conviction and inspired by the only purpose which a dissent should pursue 
according to the memorable words of Chief Justice Hughes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal to the brooding spirit of 
the law, to the intelligence of a future day, when a later decision may possibly 
correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have 
been betrayed." ("The Supreme Court" by Charles Evan Hughes, 1928 ed., p. 
68.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The cornerstone on which the opinion of the majority in the Co Kim Cham case 
was based is therein stated thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The question to be determined is whether or not the governments 
established in these Islands under the names of the Philippine Executive 
Commission and Republic of the Philippines during the Japanese military 
occupation or regime were <i>de facto</i> governments. If they were, the 
judicial acts and proceedings of those governments remain good and valid even 
after the liberation or reoccupation of the Philippines by the American and 
Filipino Forces." (75 Phil., 122.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The majority held there and, in effect our said brethren maintain hero, that 
during said "occupation" of the Islands by the Japanese Imperial Forces there 
existed in the Philippines such <i>de facto</i> governments successively under 
the "Philippine Executive Commission" and the so-called Republic of the 
Philippines. We have advisedly placed the word "occupation" within quotation 
marks because we do not admit that <i>all</i> of the Philippines was ever 
occupied by those invaders. In fact, it should be within the judicial notice of 
this Court that said occupation only affected the City of Manila and certain 
other specific areas of the Philippines, but that the greater area of the 
country was never under such an effective control of said forces as would have 
constituted a "belligerent occupation" as this concept is known in International 
Law. According to the very quotation from the Rules of Land Warfare of the 
United States Army on page 5 of the foregoing resolution, belligerent occupation 
is a question of fact. If so, <i>it needs proof</i>. And where is the evidence 
showing that the section of the country to which petitioners herein repaired and 
stayed for the express purpose of placing themselves beyond the effective reach 
and control of the Japanese invaders, was ever effectively controlled by the 
latter? The mere surrender of the military forces—not all of them, let us not 
forget, for many refused to surrender and were not only not punished but were 
eulogized by their very commanders in later days—did not bind the civilian 
population. The Commanders, Generals Wainright and Sharp, had power and control, 
for the purposes of the surrender, only over the armed forces and not over the 
civilians, and it is a matter of history that when Gen. Wainright ordered the 
so-called surrender he was already <i>a prisoner of war and had previously given 
up his command</i>; and as to Gen. Sharp, it is another historical fact that he 
did not <i>order</i>, much less <i>intend</i> to order, all his forces to 
surrender to the enemy, but gave discretion to those who preferred to continue 
the fight, to do so the best they could, so long as they detached themselves 
from the surrendering units.</p>
<p>In thus holding that during said "occupation" there existed in the 
Philippines such <i>de facto</i> governments, the majority of the Court in the 
Co Kim Cham case—be it said with all due respect—have attempted to exercise a 
power which exclusively belonged to the p61itical departments of the governments 
of the United States and of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, represented by 
the executive and legislative branches thereof. Not only this, but the majority, 
in so doing—again we say it with all clue respect—went <i>against</i> the 
previous determination of a political question by the President and the Congress 
of the United States and the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. 
That question precisely was whether or not such <i>de facto</i> governments 
existed here during the Japanese occupation of the aforesaid sections of the 
country.</p>
<p>When the preamble to the Constitution of the so-called Republic of the 
Philippines declared that the Filipino people "do hereby proclaim their 
independence", and when section 2 of Article I of said instrument stipulated 
that "The Republic of the Philippines shall exercise <i>sovereignty</i> 
(underscoring supplied) over all the national territory * * *", and when Japan 
proclaimed to the world that she had given the Philippines its independence, the 
Government of the United States and the exile Commonwealth Government in 
Washington were placed face to face with vital questions of government—who was 
the sovereign in the Philippines then? Had an independent and sovereign 
government really been established in said Islands? Did any form of government 
at all exist therein, and if so, what form? Their determination of these 
political questions was not long in coming. The first government, through 
President Roosevelt, on October 23, 1943, nine days after the inauguration of 
the said "Republic of the Philippines", made one of his most memorable 
pronouncements about the activities of the enemy here in the form of his message 
to the Filipino people of that date (U. S. Naval War College International Law 
Documents, 1943, pp. 93-94) ; the writer's dissent in the Co Kim Cham case (75 
Phil., 199, 203), from which the following is quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'I wish to make it clear that neither the former collaborationist 
"Philippine Executive Commission" nor the present "Philippine Republic" has the 
recognition or sympathy of the Government of the United States.' 
"</p></blockquote>
<p>In the course of that message, in fact in the very first sentence thereof, he 
branded the said "Republic" as "a puppet government". President Roosevelt thus 
expressed the attitude of his government towards those regimes which the 
Japanese had forced upon the Filipino people by a language of unmistakable 
meaning. Not only did he refuse, as the head of the United States government, 
and as the highest officer of the political department thereof, to recognize the 
said "Republic" as a government of <i>any</i> kind, but he categorically 
declared that it was nothing more than "a puppet government". It goes without 
saying that a puppet government <i>is no government at all</i>, not even a <i>de 
facto</i> government, for the simple reason that while a puppet government has 
no power nor authority of its own, a <i>de facto</i> government has certain 
recognized powers and authority belonging to it while it lasts.</p>
<p>Before June 29, 1944, President Quezon, exercising his powers and 
prerogatives as President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines then in exile 
in Washington, together with other Filipino leaders who were at the time in said 
exile government, requested of the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
Congress of the United States the introduction of what later became a joint 
resolution of both Houses in the form of S. J. Res. No. 93, which became law on 
June 29, 1944 (41 Off. Gaz., 3). That joint resolution characterized the 
government which the Japanese Imperial Forces had thrust upon the Filipino 
people as the Japanese's "own <i>puppet</i> government which was <i>conceived in 
intrigue, born in coercion,</i> and reared primarily for the purpose of 
<i>Japanese selfishness and aggrandizement</i>." (Recto's Three Years of Enemy 
Occupation, p. 14; italics supplied; 41 Off. Gaz., 81.)</p>
<p>When General of the Army Douglas MacArthur was only three days on Philippine 
soil after his historic landing on Leyte, he issued his already famous 
proclamation of October 23, 1944 (41 Off. Gaz., 147). In so doing, he was acting 
in a very distinct sense as the representative of his superior commander, the 
President of the United States. As already recalled in our several previous 
dissenting and concurring opinions, General MacArthur, referring to the 
"Republic of the Philippines", declared not that it was a government but that it 
was a "so-called government"; not that it had been formed legitimately under the 
rules and principles of International Law or otherwise, but that it had been 
established "under enemy duress", and that it was "based upon neither the free 
expression of the people's will nor the sanction of the government of the United 
States, and is <i>purporting</i> to exercise executive, <i>judicial</i>, and 
legislative powers of government over the people" (41 Off. Gaz., 147; italics 
supplied.)</p>
<p>That it was President Quezon and said other Filipino leaders who requested 
the introduction of the above cited joint resolution in the Congress of the 
United States, is a duly recorded fact of the contemporary history of the United 
States and Commonwealth Governments during the progress of the Pacific War 
(Three Years in Review, 41 Off. Gaz., 3).</p>
<p>All the foregoing pronouncements and declarations of the highest officials 
and representatives of the political departments of the United States and 
Commonwealth governments prove conclusively and beyond cavil that they did not 
recognize any legality or validity, even only as a <i>de facto</i> government, 
in the "so-called government" thus imposed upon the Filipinos by sheer brute 
force and military strength. On the contrary, said pronouncements and 
declarations are unanimously and emphatically expressive of the strongest 
condemnation. That determination was binding upon the courts because it decided 
a question which, being political in nature, was not for the courts to decide. 
Even conceding that the question of what is a <i>de jure</i> and what is a <i>de 
facto</i> government is a judicial one, still whether or not one or the other 
class of government exists <i>in fact</i> in a certain territory at a certain 
time, is clearly a political question for the exclusive determination of the 
political departments of the government.</p>
<p>From Wingo's "The Last Days of Manuel Quezon", the following passages have 
been quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On February 20 (1943) President Quezon spoke to the people of the 
Philippines over the radio. * * *</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"Warning the Filipino people not to be deluded by the kind of independence 
Tojo was offering them, Quezon said: 'Assuming that tomorrow Japan was to 
declare the Philippines an independent nation, what would that mean? It would 
merely mean that the Philippines would be another "Manchukuo"—a government 
without rights, without powers, without authority, a government charged only 
with the duty to obey the dictates of the Japanese rulers.' "</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, we ask: As events demonstrated, did not the "Republic of the 
Philippines" fulfill to the last detail the prediction of the great leader? Who 
would gainsay that said "Republic" was really another Manchukuo, really a 
government without rights, without powers, without authority, a government 
charged only with the duty to obey the dictates of the Japanese rulers? Who 
would have the temerity to say that President Quezon was a bad prophet, that the 
Japanese did much better than he foretold?</p>
<p>In the case of Jones <i>vs</i>. U. S. (137 U. S., 202; 34 Law. ed., 691, 
696), the following well-settled principle, theretofore invariably upheld by the 
United States Supreme Court under a great variety of circumstances, was 
reiterated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who is the sovereign, <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, of a territory is 
not a judicial, but a <i>political</i> question, the determination of which by 
the legislative and executive departments of any government <i>conclusively 
binds the judges</i>, as well as all other officers, citizens and subjects, of 
that government. This principle has always been upheld by this court, and has 
been affirmed under a great variety of circumstances. (Gelsten <i>vs</i>. Hoyt, 
16 U.S., 2 Wheat., 246, 324 [4:381; 401]; United States <i>vs</i>. Palmer, 
<i>Id</i>., 610 [471]; the Divina Pastora, 17 U.S., 4 Wheat., 52 [4:512]; 
Foster <i>vs</i>. Neilson, 27 U.S., 2 Pet., 253, 307, 309 [7:415; 433, 434]; 
Keene <i>vs</i>. M'Donough, 33 U.S., 8 Pet., 308 [8:955]; Garcia <i>vs</i>. 
Lee, 37 U.S., 12 Pet., 511, 520 (9:1176); Williams <i>vs</i>. Suffolk Ins. Co., 
38 U. S., 13 Pet., 415 [10:226]; United States <i>vs</i>. Yorba, 68 U.S., 1 
Wall., 412; 423 [17:635; 637]; United States <i>vs</i>. Lynde, 78 U.S., 11 
Wall., 632, 638 [20:230, 232]. It is equally well settled in England. The 
Pelican, Edw. Adm. Appx. D; Taylor <i>vs</i>. Barclay, 2 Sim., 213; Emperor of 
Austria <i>vs</i>. Day, 3 De G. F. &amp; J., 217, 221, 233; Republic of Peru 
<i>vs</i>. Peruvian Guano Co., L.R., 36 Ch. Div., 489, 497; Republic of Peru 
<i>vs</i>. Dreyfus, L.R., 38 Ch. Div., 348, 356, 359." (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the doctrine just quoted, the first question to be determined by 
the legislative and executive departments of the government is: Who is the 
sovereign of the territory? The next is: Is he a <i>de jure</i> or a <i>de 
facto</i> sovereign? The determination of this second question necessarily 
decides whether the government of that sovereign is <i>de jure</i> or <i>de 
facto</i>, for it is not possible to speak of a sovereign, in the instant 
acceptation of the term, without linking him with his government. And a <i>de 
jure</i> sovereign cannot have a <i>de facto</i> government, any more than can a 
<i>de facto</i> sovereign have a <i>de jure</i> government. If the legislative 
and executive departments, therefore, decide that the sovereign is <i>de 
jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, they are at the same time deciding that his 
government in that territory is <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>. For the 
spectacle can not be countenanced where the legislative and executive 
departments decide whether the sovereign is <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, 
while the judicial department decides whether his government is <i>de jure</i> 
or <i>de facto</i>, thus giving rise to the possibility that while the former 
two departments, or either of them, decide that the sovereign is <i>de jure</i>, 
the judicial decides that his government is <i>de facto</i>, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Differently expressed, the proposition would be: If the question of who is 
the sovereign, <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, of a territory is not a 
judicial, but a political question, that of whether the government in the 
territory is de jure or de facto, cannot but be a political question.</p>
<p>Indeed, whether a government, <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>, exists at 
all in a territory, entitled to recognition by another government under 
International Law, is in the very nature of things a political question 
addressed to the proper <i>political</i> officers of the latter government. For 
instance, the Department of State, as the immediate representative of the 
President of the United States, was the one which dealt with the question of the 
recognition or non-recognition of the so-called government of Manchukuo. That 
question was never addressed to, nor considered as within the province of, the 
United States Supreme Court. Secretary Stimson consistently refused to recognize 
it because he maintained that it was a mere <i>puppet government</i>. No other 
governmental department, including the judiciary, had any say in the matter. In 
fact, they considered themselves bound by the action of the political 
department. Now, Manchukuo and the "Republic of the Philippines" were creatures, 
exactly alike, of the same "creator"; and there is no gainsaying the fact that 
the "Republic of the Philippines" was no less a puppet than Manchukuo.</p>
<p>In Philipps <i>vs</i>. Payne (2 Otto. [U. S.], 130; 23 Law. ed., 649), the 
Supreme Court of the United States expressly acknowledged that "in cases 
involving the action of the political departments of the government, the 
judiciary is bound by such action." (Williams <i>vs</i>. Insurance Co., 13 Pet., 
420; Garcia <i>vs</i>. Lee, 12 Pet., 511; Kennel <i>vs</i>. Chambers, 14 How., 
38; Foster <i>vs</i>. Neilson, 2 Pet., 309; Nabod of Carnatio <i>vs</i>. East 
Ind. Co., Ves. Jr., 60; Lucer <i>vs</i>. Barbon, 7 How., 1; R. I. <i>vs</i>. 
Mass., 12 Pet., 714.)" And in Nelly <i>vs</i>. Henkel ([1] 180 U. S., 126; 45 
Law. ed., 448), the same court again abided by the determination of a similar 
question by the legislative and executive branches of the government thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * it thus appears that both the legislative and executive branches of 
the government concurred in not recognizing the existence of any such government 
as the Republic of Cuba * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>Presidents Roosevelt and Quezon, the United States Congress and General 
MacArthur all concurred in not recognizing the existence of any such government 
as the "Republic of the Philippines".</p>
<p>This vital point now demands our consideration: Did the political departments 
(legislative and executive) of the United States and the Commonwealth 
Governments determine the political question of whether the "Philippine 
Executive Commission" or the "Republic of the Philippines" was a <i>de facto</i> 
government? From the facts above narrated, it is clear that they have, and that 
their determination was unequivocally in the negative. If President Roosevelt 
had considered the regime imposed upon this country by the Japanese occupation 
army as a <i>de facto</i> government, within the meaning of International Law, 
he would not have branded the "Philippine Executive Commission" and the 
"Philippine Republic" as a "puppet government", and, since he must be presumed 
to know that a <i>de facto</i> government in international law is a form of 
government, with powers and duties of its own, as contradistinguished from a 
mere "puppet", and that such a government is entitled to recognition among 
civilized nations, he would never have so vehemently announced in his message to 
the Filipino people on October 23, 1943, that neither the one nor the other had 
the recognition or the sympathy of the government of the United States—he would 
not have condemned them.</p>
<p>If President Quezon and the other Filipino leaders with him in the exile 
Commonwealth government had considered the "Philippine Executive Commission" or 
the "Republic of the Philippines" as such a <i>de facto</i> government, it is 
obvious that they would never have requested of the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the Congress of the United States the introduction of what 
later became S. J. Res. No. 93, which became law on June 29, 1944, wherein the 
government thus imposed upon the Filipinos by the Japanese Imperial Forces was 
described as the Japanese's "own puppet government which was <i>conceived in 
intrigue, born in coercion,</i> and reared <i>primarily</i> for the purpose of 
<i>Japanese selfishness and aggrandizement</i>." Before suggesting the 
introduction of that joint resolution, that is, in his radio speech to the 
people of the Philippines of February 20, 1943, above partly quoted, President 
Quezon, in predicting that the independence that Tojo was then offering to the 
Filipinos would be another Manchukuo—a government without rights, without 
powers, without authority, a government charged only with the duty to obey the 
dictates of the Japanese rulers—could not have possibly had in mind a <i>de 
facto</i> government as this term is understood in International Law.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States 
Congress, in adopting the aforesaid joint resolution, concurred in the attitude 
of both Presidents Roosevelt and Quezon towards both the "Philippine Executive 
Commission" and the "Republic of the Philippines."</p>
<p>And lastly, had General MacArthur, as the representative of President 
Roosevelt, considered the "Republic of the Philippines" as a genuine <i>de 
facto</i> government, he would not have condemned it as he has in so severe and 
explicit terms, in his proclamation of October 23, 1944, wherein he does not 
confer upon it the honor of even the name "government", simply referring to it 
as a "so-called government."</p>
<p>By their uncompromising attitude of condemnation towards those 
Japanese-imposed regimes, the executive and legislative departments of the 
United States and the Commonwealth governments clearly did not recognize the 
existence here of a <i>de facto</i> government in the form either of the 
"Philippine Executive Commission" or the "Republic of the Philippines." Those 
political departments of both governments were the ones vested with the 
exclusive power to decide that political question (Jones <i>vs</i>. U. S., 
<i>supra</i>, and cases therein cited), and their decision "binds the judges" 
(Philipps <i>vs</i>. Payne, <i>supra</i>, and cases therein cited). The 
recognition or non-recognition of the existence here of such a <i>de facto</i> 
government was a matter pertaining to the foreign relations of the United States 
and the Commonwealth. And it is a truism that a nation is represented in its 
foreign relations, in peace as well as in war, by the political departments of 
its government, and not by the courts. The regimes imposed here by Japan during 
World War II, of course, pertained to the wartime relations between the United 
States and the Commonwealth, on the one hand, and Japan, on the other. And it 
should be recalled that under the ordinance appended to the Commonwealth 
Constitution then in force (sec. 1 [10]), Philippine foreign affairs were under 
the direct supervision and control of the United States.</p>
<p>In considering the attitude of the United States and Commonwealth governments 
towards the "Philippine Executive Commission" and the "Republic of the 
Philippines," we must not lose sight of the fact that the Commonwealth 
Government, headed by President Quezon, maintained throughout the war that, 
having gone into exile beyond the reach of the Japanese invaders, it never 
ceased to exist and to function, despite the military occupation of certain 
parts of the territory of the Philippines by the Japanese Imperial Forces. And 
in this stand the Commonwealth Government was solidly backed not only by the 
United States but by all the other United Nations. (Three Years in Review, 41 
Off. Gaz., 3.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Commonwealth Government was firmly convinced that mere military 
occupation of a territory <i>does not confer sovereign rights on the invading 
army</i> and that its <i>legal status</i>, therefore, under international law 
<i>would not be changed so long as it maintained its nucleus aboard through its 
head, President Manuel L. Quezon and his cabinet</i>, and by means of the 
emergency powers given him by the National Assembly. <i>This view was sustained 
by the United States and the other 42 members of the international group known 
as the United Nations, which officially recognized the Philippine Constitutional 
Government thus established in Washington, D. C.</i>" (<i>Ibid</i>., 3; italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>We need not reiterate here the views and arguments set forth in support of 
our stand against the opinion of the majority in our dissenting and concurring 
opinions in the following cases: Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon 
(75 Phil., 113, 371) (both as to the main decision and to the resolution on the 
motion for reconsideration); in Peralta <i>vs</i>. Director of Prisons (75 
Phil., 285); in People <i>vs</i>. Jose (75 Phil., 612); in Alcantara <i>vs</i>. 
Director of Prisons (75 Phil., 494); and in De Castro <i>vs</i>. Court of 
Appeals (75 Phil., 824).</p>
<p>In the hypothesis that the "Philippine Executive Commission" or the "Republic 
of the Philippines" was not a <i>de facto</i> government, we are confident that 
the majority would agree that the judicial proceedings had in the courts of said 
regimes were null and void. But it is not merely a hypothesis—it has been 
finally and definitely so determined by the political departments of the United 
States and the Commonwealth governments.</p>
<p>And may we be allowed now to express the hope that this Court will see its 
way clear to realizing that in laying down the doctrine in the Co Kim Cham case 
it has <i>unwittingly</i> refused to be bound by the aforesaid prior and adverse 
determination of the political departments of the United States and the 
Commonwealth governments; that it will abide by that determination, recognizing 
that the question at issue was a political, not a judicial one, within the 
province of the political departments, to the exclusion of the judicial, just as 
we would expect those departments to abide by our decisions on judicial matters; 
and that thereby an end may be put to the unfortunate and unseemly conflict, 
thus restoring the equilibrium of governmental powers which has been disturbed 
by the error into which we sincerely, but respectfully, believe the court to 
have been betrayed when it involuntarily went out of its province and entered 
another—to the end that the people may be accordingly governed and guided upon a 
question so vitally affecting their national and private lives.</p>
<p>As to the concern shown, while plausibly, for the interests of the litigants 
who voluntarily submitted their controversies to the adjudication of the 
Japanese-sponsored tribunals, we do not believe that the problem is absolutely 
without solution. Of course, as to the immediate parties who thus voluntarily 
submitted their contentious cases for settlement by said agencies of the 
occupation regimes, we encounter no special difficulty in opining that the 
situation could be likened to the case of parties voluntarily submitting their 
controversies to arbitration, and the decisions therein rendered likened to 
arbitration awards in their effects. Nothing could be further from our minds by 
this statement than to cast any sort of reflection upon the learning and ability 
of the officers, judicial and others, concerned—we simply base our assertion 
upon what to us is a case of clear lack of legal authority for those 
Japanese-created tribunals to exercise judicial functions with like effects as 
tribunals acting by authority of their lawful government, or even as genuine 
<i>de facto</i> courts.</p>In regards to criminal cases, where violations of the 
Commonwealth laws have been committed, altho the judgments of those courts 
would, we submit, also be void, where the accused have already served or 
suffered any penalty thereunder, such penalty can be easily taken into account 
in the judgments of the lawful courts, in which new complaints or informations 
may be filed, by recommending full pardon or <i>pro tanto</i> commutation of 
penalty by the Chief Executive.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISIDENTE</em></div>
<p><strong>BRIONES, M.:</strong></p>
<p>No estoy conforme con la resolucion de la mayoria; mi opinion es que la 
solicitud de <i>certiorari</i> esta bien fundada y, por tan to, debe concederse. 
A mi juicio, el presente caso encaja perfectamente dentro de las apreciaciones y 
conclusiones de mi disidencia en el asunto basico de Co Kim Cham <i>contra</i> 
Valdez Tan Keh y Dizon. Dije entonces, en parte, lo que sigue y lo reafirmo en 
esta disidencia, a saber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Al interpreter la prodama del General MacArthur de 23 de Octubre de 1944 que 
anula todas las actuaciones del gobierno establecido en estas islas bajo la 
ocupacion militar japonesa, creo que la inteleccion mas apropiada es que, como 
regla general, esa proclama anula todo, incluso las actuaciones judiciales 
(<i>judicial processes</i>), sobre todo aquellas cuya entidad y cuyos efectos 
rebasan el periodo de la esclavitud forzosa y transcienden y repercuten en la 
postliberacion. En otras palabras, la nulidad, la ineficacia debe ser la regla 
general; y la validez, la eficacia la excepcion, la salvedad.</p>
<p>"La razon de esto es sencilla. El gobierno de ocupacion representaba en 
nuestra vida un parentesis anomalo, de obligada ilegitimidad, y es nada mas que 
natural que el gobierno legitimo, <i>de jure</i>, al restaurarse, no transigiese 
con los actos y procesos de aquel gobierno, excepto en lo que fuera 
absolutamente necesario e irremediable. Caerian, por ejemplo, bajo esta 
excepcion solamente aquellos actos y procesos resultantes del hecho de que 
formabamos una comunidad civilizada con necesidades e intereses individuales y 
sociales complejos; y de que por instinto de conservacion y para vivir con 
cierto orden y relativa tranquilidad y no precipitarnos en la anarquia y en el 
caos habiamos menester la egida de un gobierno, sin importar que este no fuese 
hechura de nuestra voluntad y que inclusive nos fuera repulsivo. Mas alla del 
minimum de esta forzosidad, no puede haber transaccion con los actos y procesos 
de aquel regimen.</p>
<p>"Como corolario de esta inteleccion es obvio que por mucho que nos tienten y 
atraigan ciertas doctrinas y principios conocidos de derecho internacional sobre 
gobiernos <i>de facto</i>, no es conveniente y es hasta peligroso sentar reglas 
absolutas que a lo mejor no cuadran con las circunstancias peculiares de cada 
caso. Lo mas seguro es enjuiciar por sus propios meritos cada acto o proceso que 
se plantee.</p>
<p>"En la determinacion judicial de esta clase de asuntos nunca se deben perder 
de vista, entre otras, las siguientes circunstancias: (1) que la invasion 
japonesa, aun en el apogeo de su fuerza, jamas pudo quebrantar la lealtad 
fundamental del pueblo filipino a su gobierno y al gobierno de los Estados 
Unidos de America; (2) que en casi todas partes de Filipinas esta lealtad hizo 
posible la articulacion y organizacion soterranea de fuerzas de resistencia 
contra el enemigo; (3) que si bien el control japones era por lo general 
efectivo en las ciudades y grandes poblaciones, era, sin embargo, precario en 
muchos pueblos y barrios, sobre todo en aquellos que no tenian valor estrategico 
o eran poco propicios a la confiscacion y rapiña, dominando practicamente en 
dichos sitios las guerrillas; (4) que en algunas regiones el gobierno del 
Commonwealth seguia funcionando, trasladandose de un sitio a otro para burlar la 
persecucion del enemigo o acuartelandose en zonas a donde no alcanzaba la accion 
de las guarniciones japonesas; (5) que muchos habitantes de los llanos y 
poblados se sustrajeron a la jurisdiccion del gobierno de fuerza predominante 
(<i>paramount force</i>), refugiandose en las montañas y lugares dominados por 
las guerrillas y colocandose bajo la proteccion y salvaguardia de estas, o bien 
en sitios donde no habia ni japoneses ni guerrillas; (6) y por ultimo, que 
despues del desembarco del General MacArthur y de sus fuerzas libertadoras en 
Leyte el 20 de Octubre de 1944, la lealtad filipina y el espiritu de resistencia 
llegaron a su maxima tension y la ocupacion japonesa se fue desmoronando 
rapidamente a pedazos hasta sufrir finalmente un colapso total." (75 Phil., 403, 
404.)</p></blockquote>
<p>De autos resulta, sin eficaz contradiccion, que los peticionarios son vecinos 
de la provincia de Tayabas y se refugiaron en las montañas durante la ocupacion 
enemiga para no someterse a la autoridad de los japoneses y del gobierno 
establecido por estos en el Archipielago. Tambien consta en autos que su 
abogado, "obrando bajo instrucciones especificas", presento una excepcion o 
protesta formal contra la decision del Tribunal de Apelaciones, reservandose el 
derecho de impugnar la validez de dicha decision para despues de la emancipacion 
y reconquista. ¿Que mejor prueba de que los recurrentes no se sometieron a la 
jurisdiccion del llamado gobierno <i>de facto</i> establecido por los japoneses 
en Manila y en tales otras partes donde tuvieron control efectivo, y de que, por 
tanto, no pueden alcanzarles ni afectarles adversamente las consecuencias 
juridicas resultantes de dicho gobierno <i>de facto</i>? Que los recurrentes
