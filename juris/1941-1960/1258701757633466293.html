				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an appeal from the judgment in Criminal&nbsp; Case Nos.&nbsp; 1171 and 1172 of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Quezon, wherein appellant Melquiades Gorospe was found guilty of murder and&nbsp; sentenced in each to "suffer cadena perpetua, with the accessory penalties&nbsp; of the law,&nbsp; to indemnify the&nbsp; respective&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of Leon Padchanan and Melecio Guillen in&nbsp; the amount of P6,000.00&nbsp; in each case, and to pay the costs."&nbsp;&nbsp; These two cases were tried jointly by agreement of the parties, as the facts and circumstances. surrounding both are intimately connected and interrelated.<br><br>Five witnesses testified&nbsp; for&nbsp; the prosecution,&nbsp; namely, Eduardo Paladio, Elpidio de la Torre,&nbsp; David Valenzuela, Bernabe Andres and&nbsp; Lucia Andres,&nbsp; and established&nbsp; the following facts:<br><br>Bernabe Andres, a middle-age fisherman of 50,&nbsp; has two daughters,&nbsp; Irene and Lucia. They married&nbsp; Melecio Guillen and&nbsp; Leon&nbsp; Padchanan, respectively.&nbsp; Guillen was&nbsp; the barrio lieutenant of Sabili, municipality of Baler,&nbsp; Quezon, while Padchanan belonged to the Easy Company, 2nd BCT, of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,&nbsp; both now deceased. <br><br>On the evening of June 10, 1953, between eight and nine o'clock, Bernabe Andres and his son-in-law Leon&nbsp; Padchanan, then on a furlough, left their house in the&nbsp; sitio of Sabang, to attend a dance at the house&nbsp; of Andres&nbsp; Queblar in the barrio of Sabili.&nbsp; On their way thereto, they passed by the house of Melecio Guillen, the other&nbsp; son-in-law of Bernabe Andres, to take him&nbsp; along with&nbsp; them. While Bernabe Andres&nbsp; and&nbsp; Padchanan were&nbsp; in Guillen's house, a&nbsp; certain Matilde Aganad arrived and reported to Guillen that Melquiades Gorospe, appellant herein, was having a quarrel with his nephew Bonifacio Gorospe&nbsp; at the latter's house.&nbsp; Conscious of his duty as barrio&nbsp; lieutenant, Guillen repaired to the place&nbsp; of Bonifacio Gorospe, accompanied by Padchanan&nbsp; and their father-in-law Bernabe&nbsp; Andres. Once there, Guillen called Bonifacio who in turn invited them to come&nbsp; up.&nbsp; Guillen&nbsp; and Padchanan&nbsp; obliged, while their father-in-law remained downstairs about&nbsp; two&nbsp; or three meters from the balcony.&nbsp; The stairs of Bonifacio's house lead&nbsp; directly&nbsp; to&nbsp; a corridor which runs toward the kitchen where there is another&nbsp; staircase.&nbsp; The balcony which consists merely&nbsp; of a protruding extension of the flooring, unenclosed by any walling or railing and measuring around 1 x 1-1/2 meters, is just on the&nbsp; lateral left side of the stairs, and about a meter high from&nbsp; the ground, where one&nbsp; can easily&nbsp; go&nbsp; without&nbsp; ascending the stairs. Guillen and&nbsp; Padchanan&nbsp; squatted&nbsp; side by side near each other on the balcony, facing the lateral side of the stairs and with their backs toward the&nbsp; open space, while Bonifacio&nbsp; squatted at&nbsp; the&nbsp; head of the&nbsp; stairs,&nbsp; facing&nbsp; them. While the trio were talking, appellant Melquiades Gorospe suddenly appeared&nbsp; in the balcony behind Guillen and Padchanan, and&nbsp; without&nbsp; any ado stabbed Padchanan on the right breast with a small bolo Exhibit A.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Guillen was about to turn, appellant held him by the head and stabbed him first on&nbsp; the left&nbsp; forearm and then on the left chest, the bolo penetrating the lung, appellant saying at the same time&nbsp; "I&nbsp; will kill all of you."&nbsp; Taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; surprise, Guillen and Padchanan ran away in&nbsp; different directions, but expired in their flight.&nbsp; Their father-in-law Bernabe Andres upon seeing the stabbing, ran away fearing that he might be&nbsp; the next victim, and&nbsp; hid himself near his house.&nbsp; Appellant made his get-away along the corridor passing through&nbsp; the kitchen&nbsp; stairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this&nbsp; bloody event&nbsp; was happening,&nbsp; or&nbsp; perhaps a little after,&nbsp; Irene Andres (Guillen's wife)&nbsp; called at her father's&nbsp; house and asked&nbsp; her sister Lucia&nbsp; (Padchanan's wife)&nbsp; to go&nbsp; with her to Bonifacio's&nbsp; house to inquire whether&nbsp; their husbands were&nbsp; still there.&nbsp; Lucia told&nbsp; Irene&nbsp; to go&nbsp; ahead as she would follow a little&nbsp; later.&nbsp; Lucia thus went to Bonifacio's house as she promised, but before she could reach the stairs,&nbsp; she was met by Matilde&nbsp; Aganad who told her to go&nbsp; home as her infant breast-fed baby might catch cold, and that her husband Leon Padchanan was no longer in Bonifacio's house.&nbsp; Lucia then started to go back home, but at this juncture she heard someone shout that there was&nbsp; a dead&nbsp; man in the place. It&nbsp; was&nbsp; only then that Matilde Aganad told her that her husband Leon Padchanan was dead.&nbsp; Lucia went to the place where the voice came from,&nbsp; and really&nbsp; found&nbsp; her husband&nbsp; sprawled on&nbsp; the ground, dead.&nbsp; She embraced him and wept. <br><br>At about ten o'clock that same&nbsp; evening,upon receiving a report, the chief of police of Baler, Elpidio de la Torre, accompanied by policemen, together with Dr. Cenon and sanitary inspector&nbsp; Eduardo Paladio, went to the barrio of Sabili to make an investigation of the crime, and found the body of Padchanan, face up some forty meters from the principal stairs of Bonifacio's house, and that of Guillen about twenty&nbsp; meters from the&nbsp; balcony.&nbsp; A handgrenade was&nbsp; found inside the right pocket of&nbsp; Guillen's troussers. Then the chief of police went to&nbsp; the&nbsp; house of Bonifacio and he found that there were bloodstains on the balcony, stairs,&nbsp; and on the sleeping mat spread on the corridor. In view of the reluctance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the inmates of the house&nbsp; to reveal how the killing happened, the chief of police brought them to the municipal building for investigation.&nbsp; Among them were Bonifacio Gorospe, his sister Virginia Gorospe, some visitors of Bonifacio, and&nbsp; appellant himself.&nbsp; There they pointed to appellant as the killer, and the statements of Bonifacio&nbsp; (Exhibit G),&nbsp; visitor Hospicio Libag (Exhibit H) and of appellant himself (Exhibit F) were taken down, which were afterwards sworn to before Mayor David T. Valenzuela.&nbsp; In appellant's statement Exhibit F,&nbsp; he admitted having killed Guillen with the small bolo Exhibit A because he had&nbsp; a grudge against Guillen since a year before when Guillen hit him with a piece&nbsp; of wood on the leg for which he was&nbsp; hospitalized, and&nbsp; he also&nbsp; admitted having killed Padchanan because he had&nbsp; heard Padchanan remark earlier that evening that they would assault him. <br><br>Upon autopsy of the corpses by Dr. Cenan, assisted by sanitary inspector Eduardo Paladio, they found, with respect to Leon Padchanan— <br><blockquote>"*** * a stabbed wound with clean&nbsp; cut borders and edges, measuring 1" x l/2" diameter, with the greater diameter lying perpendicular over the point 1" to the right of stenoclavicular junction right which just exactly corresponds in direction to the slit in the clothing. Probing revealed that the wound has taken an inferosposterior direction to about&nbsp; 4" deep.&nbsp; On&nbsp; opening up, there were clotted blood just beneath the fatty tissue and the clavicle at point 1"&nbsp; to the right of stenoclavicular&nbsp; junction was&nbsp; almost completely severed&nbsp; by a clean sweep of incision on the anterior aspect.&nbsp; The wound has penetrated&nbsp; deep into the lung tissues and almost severed the&nbsp; subclavian vessel."&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp; B). and with respect to Melecio Guillen—<br><br>"* * * there was a&nbsp; stabbed wound&nbsp; with&nbsp; clean cut&nbsp; edges and borders measuring 2" x 1" diameter, with the greater diameter lying horizontally and exactly fit the 5th ICS left chest whose outer extremity&nbsp; is in line with&nbsp; MCL. Clotted blood was found beneath the edges&nbsp; of&nbsp; the wound. On probing the wound has taken a posteriorly direction.&nbsp; On opening up the 5th rib was&nbsp; slightly slashed from "beneath with separation of&nbsp; small fragments toward the left, the pericardium&nbsp; exposed up the left ventricle&nbsp; of the heart and wound&nbsp; ending posteriorly&nbsp; penetrating the left lungs. The wound was&nbsp; 5" deep. "<br><br>There was incised wound, triangular in shape at forearm upper third,&nbsp; anterior&nbsp; with&nbsp; apex&nbsp; directed downward.&nbsp; The&nbsp; base is 21" and altitude is 2" with severance of upper third of superficial flexers of forearm left;&nbsp; and palmaris longus muscle."&nbsp; (Exhibit D).<br></blockquote>The record discloses that appellant herein was originally indicted for this offense in Criminal&nbsp; Cases Nos. 1113 and 1114 upon informations filed on&nbsp; June 30, 1953, but inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; the principal witnesses for the prosecution, particularly Bonifacio Gorospe, turned hostile by subscribing an&nbsp; affidavit favorable to appellant, the Provincial Fiscal had to ask for the dismissal&nbsp; of said cases,&nbsp; and the court then sitting at Baler dismissed&nbsp; them provisionally,&nbsp; with appellant's consent, in its order of July&nbsp; 1st, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was only after&nbsp; such&nbsp; dismissal that&nbsp; witnesses Bernabe Andres who, according to the&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; had&nbsp; kept to himself the knowledge of the facts&nbsp; and circumstances&nbsp; of the killing of his two sons-in-law believing honestly that&nbsp; he could not testify for the government by reason of his relationship, came to the open and subscribed an affidavit&nbsp; before acting Mayor Cesario A.&nbsp; Pimentel on July 2, 1954, relating how the crime was committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the strength of this affidavit, assistant Provincial Fiscal Severino I. Villafranca filed the corresponding informations dated&nbsp; July 6, 1954, which were docketed and now known as Criminal Cases Nos. 1171 and 1172 and asked the court for their revival.&nbsp; The court, after making another preliminary investigation, revived these cases in its order of September 7, 1954, and its judgment is now appealed against. <br><br>Appellant in his defense admits having stabbed the two deceased, but alleges that he killed them in self-defense, and in support thereof he tried to show by his testimony and those of his nephew Bonifacio Gorospe and niece Virginia Gorospe that at about four o'clock in the afternoon&nbsp; of June 10th,&nbsp; 1953, a certain Florencio Carreon who was courting Virginia was visiting her at&nbsp; Bonifacio's house where she lives;&nbsp; that in the course of that visit Florencio held&nbsp; her hand, and her brother Bonifacio did not like Florencio's behavior, so the latter was&nbsp; told to leave and never to return;&nbsp; that later that afternoon while Bonifacio was in the store of Rafael Orlando, Padchanan and&nbsp; Guillen arrived and asked&nbsp; Bonifacio to buy drinks for&nbsp; them,&nbsp; so the three got drunk;&nbsp; that Bonifacio went home and left Guillen and Padchanan in the store; that later that evening, at about 8:30, while the visitors in the house of Bonifacio were already lying down on the mat spread on the corridor of the house,&nbsp; Guillen&nbsp; and&nbsp; Padchanan&nbsp; arrived,&nbsp; Padchanan carrying a .45 caliber&nbsp; gun in his waist; that Bonifacio got the kerosene lamp&nbsp; inside and put&nbsp; it near the door; that in the course of the conversation among the three, Virginia was called and Guillen and&nbsp; Padchanan wanted to take her with them, for her to&nbsp; talk with Florencio Carreon at Guillen's house; that when Virginia refused to go with them, Guillen pulled her by&nbsp; the arm,&nbsp; so she screamed: "I don't want, I don't want; neighbors help;" that when appellant, whose house is&nbsp; just about ten meters&nbsp; from&nbsp; Bonifacio's heard her screams for help, he armed&nbsp; himself&nbsp; with the bolo Exhibit A which&nbsp; was&nbsp; in its scabbard hanging on the wall, and rushed to her rescue; that upon arriving at Bonifacio's house he demanded explanation from Guillen and Padchanan, only to be told by Guillen that he should not interfere, whereupon Padchanan told Guillen to take out his handgrenade and blast the house so that all the inmates would be killed; that Guillen got his&nbsp; handgrenade out and when he was about to pull&nbsp; its safety pin, appellant unsheathed his bolo and stabbed Guillen;&nbsp; that when Padchanan saw this, he squeezed appellant's neck, so appellant stabbed Padchanan without the latter having&nbsp; a chance to draw his gun,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; both Guillen&nbsp; and&nbsp; Padchanan&nbsp; ran&nbsp; away; that appellant then returned to his house, but later went again to Bonifacio's place where he&nbsp; met councilor Tomas Bitong whom he told that he had&nbsp; just killed the two deceased; that&nbsp; appellant took councilor Bitong to his house and there surrendered the bolo and its scabbard, and from there they went back to Bonifacio's house and thence appellant was conducted by the councilor to the municipal jail where his statement Exhibit F was taken by the chief of police.<br><br>After a careful scrutiny of appellant's contention, we find that he tried&nbsp; to take advantage of the fact that&nbsp; a handgrenade was found inside Guillen's pocket after his. death, and has&nbsp; woven his defense around it, coloring the same with situations that are highly incredible and contrary to the natural&nbsp; course of things and human behavior. First of all, it is hard to believe that Guillen took out his. handgrenade&nbsp; and was about to pull its pin before he was stabbed by appellant, for the simple&nbsp; reason that, if this were&nbsp; true, then said grenade should&nbsp; have exploded or at least&nbsp; should have been found near the balcony&nbsp; itself or at any place along his flight, and not right inside his pocket when he expired just twenty meters away from the balcony;&nbsp; secondly,&nbsp; were it true that Padchanan was armed with a .45 caliber gun at the time that Guillen was being stabbed, he would not, as a professional soldier, have just strangled appellant to defend his brother-in-law, but would have&nbsp; conveniently used&nbsp; his&nbsp; pistol.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to&nbsp; Lucia&nbsp; Andres, her husband Leon Padchanan&nbsp; did&nbsp; not carry his gun when he left for the dance but left it&nbsp; with her, and this is corroborated by the testimony of&nbsp; the&nbsp; chief of police who stated that no gun was ever found&nbsp; in the premises during&nbsp; his investigation.&nbsp; Thirdly, it is&nbsp; hard&nbsp; to&nbsp; believe that Padchanan squeezed appellant's neck before he was stabbed, for according to eyewitnesses Bernabe&nbsp; Andres, the first one&nbsp; to be&nbsp; assaulted was&nbsp; Padchanan who immediately&nbsp; ran and died on the way. Lastly, the defense put up by appellant is&nbsp; entirely contrary&nbsp; to what he&nbsp; and his nephew&nbsp; Bonifacio narrated&nbsp; in their&nbsp; statements Exhibits F and G, wherein both admitted that no conversation between appellant, on&nbsp; the one&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; and Guillen and/or Padchanan, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other,&nbsp; had ever ensued,&nbsp; and that the attack was made all of a sudden and&nbsp; without warning; that appellant had a&nbsp; grudge against Guillen since a year before by reason of Guillen's having struck appellant&nbsp; with a piece&nbsp; of wood, and according to appellant himself, he had to kill Padchanan because he had heard&nbsp; him (Padchanan) say to Guillen while the two were passing in front of his house that evening that they would&nbsp; assault him&nbsp; (appellant).&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly it&nbsp; is&nbsp; more reasonable&nbsp; to&nbsp; believe that, with a&nbsp; feeling&nbsp; of revenge against Guillen and&nbsp; goaded at the spur of the moment by Padchanan's threat, appellant armed&nbsp; himself&nbsp; with a bolo and followed them&nbsp; to Bonifacio's house and there&nbsp; dealt with&nbsp; them before they could carry out what they,&nbsp; in appellant's mind, proposed to do.<br><br>The evidence against appellant is so overwhelming&nbsp; that even his counsel de officio stated&nbsp; in his brief, by way&nbsp; of comment, that—<br><blockquote>"After perusing the&nbsp; evidence, the undersigned fully agrees with the reasons given&nbsp; by the&nbsp; trial court for believing the witnesses for the prosecution and discrediting appellant's defense and the testimony of his witnesses. In addition, the undersigned counsel notes that appellant narrated in the witness stand during the trial&nbsp; a&nbsp; story entirely&nbsp; different&nbsp; from what he&nbsp; stated&nbsp; in his confession executed before the chief of police and sworn to before the mayor immediately after the occurrence. Considering that&nbsp; the&nbsp; questions and answers 192 in said confession were explained and translated&nbsp; from Tagalog to Ilocano and vice- versa to appellant before he was made to sign&nbsp; and swore to it, and that these two officials were not shown to have&nbsp; any motive or&nbsp; reason for compelling appellant&nbsp; to execute&nbsp; a fabricated confession&nbsp; appellant himself&nbsp; admits&nbsp; that&nbsp; these&nbsp; officials have no grudge against&nbsp; him and therefore should&nbsp; be taken to have acted regularly in the performance of their official duties in the investigation of the case, the undersigned counsel is constrained to disagree with appellant's claim that&nbsp; the confession in question was executed by him without first understanding its contents. Obviously, appellant's story in the&nbsp; witness&nbsp; stand&nbsp; can not but be an afterthought. Moreover,&nbsp; in line with the&nbsp; reasons given by&nbsp; appellant in his said confession&nbsp; for attempting against the lives of Leon&nbsp; and Melecio, what&nbsp; must have happened&nbsp; was that appellant&nbsp; really&nbsp; followed&nbsp; the victims that night to the house of Bonifacio&nbsp; upon overhearing Leon's remarks that they (Leon and Melecio) were going to strike&nbsp; at&nbsp; him that same evening, and that upon overtaking them in Bonifacio's house, appellant started a&nbsp; fight with the two."&nbsp; (8-9, Appellant's Brief.)<br></blockquote>The facts proven against appellant constitute the&nbsp; crime of murder,&nbsp; he having,&nbsp; as&nbsp; described&nbsp; by&nbsp; Bernabe Andres and supported by appellant's admission&nbsp; in his&nbsp; statement Exhibit&nbsp; F, treacherously stabbed the&nbsp; two deceased&nbsp; one after the other on the night in question.<br><br>Appellant,&nbsp;&nbsp; however,&nbsp; invokes&nbsp; two&nbsp; mitigating&nbsp; circumstances in&nbsp; his&nbsp; favor, namely, voluntary&nbsp; surrender&nbsp; and lack&nbsp; of instruction or schooling&nbsp; which,&nbsp; according to him, the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; failed to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp; respect to the first circumstance, the evidence does not&nbsp; show that appellant&nbsp; surrendered voluntarily; on the contrary,&nbsp; according to the uncontradicted testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; chief&nbsp; of police, he had to take several persons, including appellant, to the municipal building for investigation&nbsp; as&nbsp; nobody&nbsp; in&nbsp; Bonifacio's&nbsp; house&nbsp; volunteered to&nbsp; give information about the killing; and as regards the bolo allegedly&nbsp; surrendered to councilor Bitong, the chief of police assured the court that it was only during&nbsp; the course of his investigation in the municipal building that he learned that&nbsp; the&nbsp; said weapon was hidden in a&nbsp; rice container locally known as&nbsp; "buklod" in&nbsp; appellant's house,&nbsp; and for that&nbsp; reason&nbsp; he&nbsp; had to&nbsp; request the&nbsp; councilor to&nbsp; accompany one Leon Rabor&nbsp; to fetch the bolo. <br><br>Regarding the second circumstance&nbsp; of lack of instruction, the evidence&nbsp; shows that appellant is really an&nbsp; unschooled fisherman&nbsp; of 50 who had only to use his thumbmark in lieu of signature, and the Solicitor-General agrees that this be considered&nbsp; as mitigating circumstance in&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; favor.&nbsp; We do not, however,&nbsp; subscribe&nbsp; to this point of view, for&nbsp; illiteracy&nbsp; alone does not constitute&nbsp; the alternative circumstance&nbsp; of lack of&nbsp; instruction,&nbsp; for,&nbsp; as we&nbsp; have ruled&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; People <i> vs</i>. Ripas,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al., 95 Phil.,&nbsp; 63.<br><blockquote>"The fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; Orbista thumbmarked the&nbsp; document attesting to the promulgation of the decision, a sign that he did not know how to write, is not sufficient to&nbsp; prove the existence of this alternative circumstance. Not illiteracy alone but also lack of sufficient intelligence are necessary to invoke the benefit of the circumstance.&nbsp; A person able to sign his name but otherwise so densely ignorant and of such low intelligence that he does not realize the full consequences of a&nbsp; criminal act, may still be entitled to this mitigating circumstance. On the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, another unable to write because of lack of educational facilities or opportunities, may&nbsp; yet be highly or exceptionally intelligent and mentally alert that he easily and even realizes the full significance of his acts, in which case&nbsp; he may not invoke this mitigating circumstance in his favor."<br></blockquote>Consequently, and there being no aggravating nor mitigating&nbsp; circumstance present, the penalty&nbsp; that should&nbsp; be imposed&nbsp; is&nbsp; <i>reclusion perpetua</i>&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions&nbsp; of Art. 248,&nbsp; in relation to Arts.&nbsp; 77&nbsp; and&nbsp; 64, paragraph&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; and, therefore, the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; which&nbsp; imposes "cadena perpetua" should be accordingly modified. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; with the modification above&nbsp; indicated,&nbsp; the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all other respects, with costs. <br><br><i>Paras C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Reyes J. B. L., JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur. <br></div>
