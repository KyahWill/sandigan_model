				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This is a petition for&nbsp; a writ of&nbsp; certiorari to annul an order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Quezon City directing—<br><blockquote>* *&nbsp; *&nbsp; the National&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Investigation&nbsp; and tho&nbsp; Department of Foreign Affairs&nbsp; for them to take&nbsp; proper steps in order that the&nbsp; accused, Emilio Suntay&nbsp; y Aguinaldo, who is alleged to be in the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States,&nbsp; may be&nbsp; brought back&nbsp; to the:&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; so that he may be dealt with in accordance with law, (Exhibit D) and&nbsp; of prohibition&nbsp; to enjoin the Secretary for&nbsp; Foreign Affairs from&nbsp; cancelling&nbsp; the petitioner's passport without previous hearing.</blockquote><br><br>On 26 June 1954, Dr. Antonio Nubia, father of Alicia Nubia,&nbsp; a minor&nbsp; of&nbsp; 16&nbsp; years,&nbsp; filed a&nbsp; verified complaint against Emilio Suntay in the Office of&nbsp; the City Attorney of Quezon&nbsp; City,&nbsp; as follows:<br><br><blockquote>On&nbsp; or&nbsp; about&nbsp; June&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1954, the&nbsp; accused took&nbsp; Alicia&nbsp; Nubia from&nbsp; St. Paul's College&nbsp; in&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; City&nbsp; with&nbsp; lewd&nbsp; design and took her to somewhere near&nbsp; the U.P. compound in Diliman, Quezon City and&nbsp; was then&nbsp; able to&nbsp; have carnal&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; of&nbsp; her.&nbsp; Alicia Nubia is&nbsp; a minor of 16 years.</blockquote>On&nbsp; 15 December 1954, after an investigation, an Assistant City Attorney&nbsp; recommended to the&nbsp; City Attorney of Quezon City that the complaint be dismissed for lack of merit. On&nbsp; 23&nbsp; December 1954 attorney for the complainant ad- dressed a letter to the City Attorney of Quezon City where- in he took&nbsp; exception to the recommendation of the Assistant City Attorney referred to and urged that a complaint for seduction&nbsp; be filed&nbsp; against the herein petitioner.<br><br>On 10 January 1955 the petitioner applied for and was granted a passport by&nbsp; the Department of Foreign Affairs (No.&nbsp; 5981&nbsp; [A39184]).&nbsp; On&nbsp; 20&nbsp; January&nbsp; 1955 the&nbsp; petitioner left the Philippines for San&nbsp; Francisco, California, U.S.A., where he is at present enrolled in school.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 31 January 1955&nbsp; the offended girl subscribed and swore to a complaint charging the&nbsp; petitioner with&nbsp; seduction which was filed in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Quezon City after preliminary investigation had been conducted (crim. case No.&nbsp; Q-1E96,&nbsp; Exhibit B).&nbsp; On 9 February 1955 the private prosecutor filed&nbsp; a motion praying the Court&nbsp; to issue an&nbsp; order "directing such&nbsp; government&nbsp; agencies&nbsp; as may&nbsp; be concerned,&nbsp; particularly&nbsp; the National Bureau&nbsp; of Investigation&nbsp; and the Department of Foreign Affairs, for the purpose of&nbsp; having the accussed brought back to the Philippines&nbsp; so that he may&nbsp; be dealt with in accordance with law."&nbsp; (Exhibit C.)&nbsp;&nbsp; On 10 February 1955 the Court granted the motion (Exhibit D).&nbsp; On 7&nbsp; March 1955 the respondent Secretary cabled the Ambassador to the United States instructing him to order the Consul General in San Francisco to cancel the&nbsp; passport issued to the petitioner and to compel him to&nbsp; return to the Philippines to answer the&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; charges&nbsp; against him.&nbsp; "The Embassy was likewise directed to make representation with the&nbsp; State Department that&nbsp; Emilio&nbsp; Suntay's presence outside the Philippines is&nbsp; considere<br><br>The petitioner contends that as the order of the respondent Court directing the Department of Foreign Affairs "to take proper&nbsp; steps&nbsp; in order that the"&nbsp; petitioner "may be brought back to the Philippines, so that he&nbsp; may be dealt with&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with law," may&nbsp; be carried out only "through the cancellation of his passport," the&nbsp; said order is illegal because "while&nbsp; a Court&nbsp; may review&nbsp; the&nbsp; action of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs in cancelling a pass- port and grant&nbsp; relief when the Secretary's discretion&nbsp; is abused, the&nbsp; court&nbsp; cannot, in the first instance, take the discretionary power away from the Secretary&nbsp; and itself order a passport to be cancelled."&nbsp; The petitioner further contends&nbsp; that while&nbsp; the Secretary for Foreign Affairs&nbsp; has discretion in the&nbsp; cancellation&nbsp; of passports,&nbsp; "such&nbsp; discretion cannot be exercised until after hearing," because the right to travel or&nbsp; stay&nbsp; abroad is a personal liberty within the meaning and protection&nbsp; of the Constitution&nbsp; and hence he cannot be deprived of such liberty without&nbsp; due process of law. The&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; contention&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; sustained.&nbsp; The petitioner is charged with seduction.&nbsp; And the order of the respondent Court&nbsp; directing&nbsp; the Department of&nbsp; Foreign Affairs "to take proper steps in order&nbsp; that the accused *&nbsp; * * may be brought back to the&nbsp; Philippines, so that he may be dealt with&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with law," is not beyond or in excess&nbsp; of its jurisdiction. <br><blockquote>When by law&nbsp; jurisdiction is conferred on a&nbsp; court&nbsp; or judicial officer, all auxiliary writs, processes and other&nbsp; means necessary to carry it into effect may be employed by&nbsp; such court or officer; and if the procedure to be followed in the exercise of&nbsp; such jurisdiction is&nbsp; not specifically pointed out by these rules, any suitable process&nbsp; or&nbsp; mode&nbsp; of&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; may be&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; which appears most conformable to the spirit of said rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section 6, Rule 124.)</blockquote>Moreover, the respondent Court did not specify what step the respondent Secretary&nbsp; must take&nbsp; to compel the petitioner to&nbsp; return to the Philippines to&nbsp; answer the criminal charge preferred against him.<br><br>Section&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; Executive Order&nbsp; No. 1, series of 1946, 42 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.&nbsp; 1400, prescribing rules&nbsp; and&nbsp; regulations for the grant&nbsp; and issuance of passports,&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that—<br><blockquote>The Secretary of Foreign Affairs as well as any diplomatic&nbsp; or consular officer&nbsp; duly&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; by&nbsp; him,&nbsp;&nbsp; is authorized,&nbsp; m&nbsp; his dixcretion, to refuse to issue a passport, to&nbsp; restrict a passport for use&nbsp; only in certain&nbsp; countries, to restrict it&nbsp; against&nbsp; use in&nbsp; certain countries, to withdraw or cancel a paxaport&nbsp; alread/ij&nbsp; issued,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to withdraw a passport for the purpose of&nbsp; restricting&nbsp; its validity&nbsp; or use in certain countries.&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>True, the&nbsp; discretion granted, to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary for Foreign Affairs&nbsp; to&nbsp; withdraw or&nbsp; cancel a&nbsp; passport&nbsp; already issued may not be exercised at whim.&nbsp;&nbsp; But here&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner was hailed to Court&nbsp; to&nbsp; answer a&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; charge tor seduction and although at&nbsp; first&nbsp; an Assistant City Attorney recommended&nbsp; the dismissal of&nbsp; the complaint previously subscribed&nbsp; and sworn to by the father of the offended girl, yet the petitioner knew that no final action had been&nbsp; taken by the City Attorney of Quezon City as the case was still under study.&nbsp; And as the Solicitor&nbsp; General puts it, "His suddenly leaving the country in&nbsp; such&nbsp; a convenient&nbsp; time, can&nbsp; reasonably be interpreted to mean&nbsp; as a deliberate at- tempt on Ms part to flee from justice, and, therefore, he cannot now be heard to complain if the strong arm of the law&nbsp; should join together&nbsp; to bring him back&nbsp; to&nbsp; justice." In issuing the order in question, the respondent&nbsp; Secretary was&nbsp; convinced that a miscarriage&nbsp; of justice would result by his&nbsp; inaction and as he issued it in the exercise of his sound&nbsp; discretion, he cannot&nbsp; be enjoined from carrying it out.<br><br>Counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the petitioner insists that his client should have been granted a. "quasi-judicial hearing" by&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent Secretary before withdrawing or&nbsp; cancelling the passport issued to him.&nbsp; Hearing would have been proper and necessary if the reason (or the withdrawal or cancellation&nbsp; of the passport&nbsp; were not&nbsp; clear but&nbsp; doubtful.&nbsp; But where the holder of a&nbsp; passport is facing a criminal charge in our courts and left the&nbsp; country to evade criminal prosecution, the Secretary for&nbsp; Foreign Affairs,&nbsp; in the exercise of Ms discretion&nbsp; to&nbsp; revoke a passport already issued, cannot&nbsp; be held to&nbsp; have acted&nbsp; whimsically&nbsp; or&nbsp; capriciously in withdrawing and cancelling such&nbsp; passport.&nbsp; Due process does not necessarily mean or&nbsp; require a hearing.&nbsp; When discretion is exercised by an officer vested with it upon an undisputed fact, such as the filing of a serious criminal charge against the&nbsp; passport holder,&nbsp; hearing may be dispensed with by such&nbsp; officer as&nbsp; a prerequisite to the cancellation of his passport;&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of such hearing&nbsp; does&nbsp; not violate the due process of law clause of the Constitution; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of the discretion vested&nbsp; in&nbsp; him cannot be deemed whimsical and capricious because of the absence of such&nbsp; hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; hearing should always&nbsp; be&nbsp; held&nbsp; in order to comply with&nbsp; the due process of law clause of the Constitution, then a writ of preliminary injunction issued <i>ex parte</i>&nbsp; would be&nbsp; violative&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; clause.<br><br>In the cases of Bauer vs.&nbsp; Acheson, 106 F. Supp.&nbsp; 445; Nathan, vs. Dulles, 129 F. Supp. 951; and Schachtman vs. Dulles No. 12406, 23 June 1955, all decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the&nbsp; district of&nbsp; Columbia, cited by the petitioner, the revocation of a passport already issued or refusal&nbsp; to issue&nbsp; a passport applied for, was&nbsp; on the vague reason that the continued possession or the&nbsp; issuance thereof would be contrary to the best interest of the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States.<br><br>The petition is denied, with costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J. B. L.,&nbsp; Endeneia</i> and <i>Felix JJ</i>.,&nbsp; concur.</div>
