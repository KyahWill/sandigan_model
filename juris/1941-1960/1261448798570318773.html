				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of First Instance of Cebu, the defendant-appellee Po Giok To was 
charged with the crime of falsification under the following information:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 7th day of January 1952, in the City of Cebu, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said 
accused, with intent to falsify or forge a public document, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously falsify, or forge a public document 
consisting of residence certificate No. A—1618529 issued to him in the City of 
Cebu, on January 7, 1952, by a representative of the City Treasurer of Cebu, to 
wit: by misrepresenting to the said representative of the City Treasurer of Cebu 
that his name is Antonio Perez, that his place of birth is Jaro, Leyte and that 
his citizenship is Filipino, and by means of such misrepresentation, said 
representative of the City Treasurer of Cebu was made to issue and write, and in 
fact did issue and write, on the corresponding lines on said residence 
certificate No. A-1618529 the name of Antonio Perez, as the name of the 
taxpayer, Jaro, Leyte as his place of birth, and Filipino as his citizenship, 
thus causing it to appear that the said residence certificate No. A-1618529 
dated January 7, 1952, was issued to one Antonio Perez with his place of birth 
as Jaro, Leyte, and with his citizenship as Filipino, when in truth and in fact, 
as the accused well knew, his true name is Po Giok To, his place of birth is 
Amoy, China, and his citizenship is Chinese."</p>
<p>Contrary to law."</p>
<p>(Appellant's Brief, pp. 2-3).</p></blockquote>
<p>The accused filed a motion to quash on the ground that the information does 
not allege (1) that the accused had the obligation to disclose the truth in the 
document allegedly falsified, nor (2) that the accused had the wrongful intent 
to injure a third person. The City Fiscal opposed the motion to quash, claiming 
that the information alleges all the integral elements of the offense charged as 
defined by the statute. The lower Court, however, found the motion to quash 
meritorious and ordered the amendment of the information. Upon insistence of the 
City Fiscal that the information was sufficient and that he was not in 
possession of any evidence that the accused made use of the residence 
certificate containing the alleged false entries, the Court <em>a quo</em> 
dismissed the case without prejudice. Hence, this appeal by the Government.</p>
<p>The sole issue is whether or not the information in question alleges 
sufficient facts to constitute the crime of falsification of public document. 
The defense contends that the information is insufficient for failure to recite 
two alleged essential elements of the crime charged; namely, the obligation on 
the part of the accused to disclose the truth, and wrongful intent on the part 
of the accused to injure third persons.</p>
<p>We agree with the Solicitor-General that the first element allegedly lacking 
in the information, viz., the obligation on the part of the accused to disclose 
the truth as to the facts that should appear in a residence certificate, is 
inherent in the very nature and purpose of said document. Section 3 of 
Commonwealth Act 465 (otherwise known as the Residence Tax Act) provides "that 
the residence certificate for persons shall contain the full name, place and 
date of birth, citizenship, civil status, length of residence in the 
Philippines, length of residence in the city or municipality where the 
certificate is issued, occupation or calling", all of which facts are required 
to appear therein for the purpose of establishing the true and correct identity 
of the person to whom the certificate is issued. Needless to say, this provision 
implies that the person to whom the certificate is issued must state to the 
officer who issues the same, the true facts, required to appear therein, the 
latter having merely the ministerial function of recording thereon the facts as 
supplied by this person. And to guarantee that the facts given correctly and 
truly identify the holder of the certificate, he is also required by Sec. 3, 
<em>supra</em>, to sign the document and affix his right hand thumb mark 
thereon. There is, therefore, no question that the accused had the duty to 
disclose the true facts about his name, place of birth, and citizenship to the 
officer or employee who issued his residence certificate No. A-1618529; and such 
duty being inherent in the transaction, there was no need for the criminal 
charge to allege that the accused had such duty. Anent the second element 
allegedly lacking in the information in question, the law is clear that wrongful 
intent on the part of the accused to injure a third person is not an essential 
element of the crime of falsification of public document.</p>
<p>Article 172, par. 1, in connection with Art. 171, par. 4, of the Revised 
Penal Code, under which provision the accused is charged, provides as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 171. Falsification by public officer, employee or notary or 
ecclesiastic minister.—The penalty of <em>prision mayor</em> and a fine not to 
exceed 5,000 pesos shall be imposed upon any public oifieer, employee, or notary 
who, taking advantage of his official position, shall falsify a document by 
committing any of the following acts:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4. Making untruthful statements in a narration of facts." </p></blockquote>
<p>"Art. 172. Falsification by private individuals and use of falsified 
documents.—The penalty of <em>prision correctional</em> in its medium and 
maximum periods and a fine of not more than 5,000 pesos shall be imposed 
upon:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Any private individual wko shall commit any of the falsifications 
enumerated in the next preceding article in any public or official document or 
letter of exchange or any other kind of commercial document."</p>
<p>On the other hand, Art. 172, par. 2, defining the crime falsification of 
private document, provides:</p>
<p>"2. Any person who, <em>to the damage of a third party, or with intent to 
cause such damage</em>, shall in any private document . commit any of the acts 
of falsification enumerated in the next preceding 
article."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>The distinction made by the law between falsification by private persons, 
first, of public documents, and secondly of private documents, is clear; the 
first is committed by mere performance of any of the acts of falsification 
enumerated in Art. 171; while the second is committed not only by the 
performance of any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Art. 171; but it 
must likewise be shown that such act of falsification was committed to the 
damage of a third party or with intent to cause such damage.</p>
<p>The reason for the distinction is given in a decision of the Supreme Court of 
Spain dated December 23, 1885, cited by this Court in the case of People 
<em>vs</em>. Pacana, 47 Phil. 48; i.e., that in the falsification of public or 
official documents, whether by public officials or by private persons, it is 
unnecessary that there be present the idea of gain or the intent to injure a 
third person, for the reason that, in contradistinction to private documents, 
the principal thing punished is the violation of the public faith and the 
destruction of the truth as therein solemnly proclaimed.</p>
<p>Our own commentators on the Revised Penal Code are also agreed on this 
distinction. (Francisco, Revised Penal Code.) Sec. ed., Vol. II, Part 1, p. 301; 
Guevara, Comm. on the Revised Penal Code, IV Ed., p. 172; Albert, Revised Penal 
Code, 1948 Ed., p. 398).</p>
<p>Moreover, the acts charged, if true, would result in confusion in the 
government records, since the fingerprint of the accused would not correspond to 
that of the person whose personal circumstances are recited in the certificate. 
Such confusion in its records evidently operates to the Government's prejudice. 
Being the natural and direct result of the criminal act charged, the accused 
must be presumed to have intended it.</p>
<p>Defendant-appellee also advances the theory that a private person can not 
commit the crime of falsification charged, i. e., by making untruthful 
statements in a narration of facts, referring to the opinion of the late Justice 
Albert that "only three of the eight ways of committing falsifications 
enumerated in Article 171, to wit, the first, the fifth, and the sixth, are open 
to a private individual" (Albert, <em>supra</em>, p. 405); and stresses that if 
there had been any falsification at all in this case, it was committed by the 
employee who, though innocently, wrote the allegedly untrue facts on defendant's 
residence certificate. The opinion quoted plainly refers to direct falsification 
by a private person, and does not contemplate situations where the accused, 
though a private person, becomes a principal to the act of falsification 
committed by a public official or employee, by induction, cooperation, or 
planned conspiracy (cf. Sent, of Tribunal Supremo of Spain of 23 Mar. 1885; 28 
Apr. 1905; 28 Mar. 1893). In the present case, although it is true that it was 
the employee of the Office of the City Treasurer of Cebu who performed the overt 
act of writing the allegedly false facts on the defendant's residence 
certificate, it was, however, the defendant who induced him to do so by 
supplying him with those facts. Consequently, the employee was defendant's mere 
innocent agent in the performance of the crime charged, while defendant was a 
principal by inducement.</p>
<p>Finally, it is argued for the defendant-appellee that there being a special 
law with respect to residence certificates expressly punishing their 
falsification (Commonwealth Act No. 465), this special law, and not the 
provisions of the Revised Penal Code, should apply in this case; and since 
Commonwealth Act No. 465, sec. 11, punishes the falsification of a residence 
certificate only when it is done "for the purpose of using the same in the 
payment of revenue or in securing any exemption or privilege conferred by law", 
which element is not alleged in the information, the same was properly dismissed 
by the lower Court. Again this contention is without merit. The fact that 
Commonwealth Act No, 465 punishes the falsification of residence certificates in 
the cases mentioned therein does not prevent the application of the general 
provisions of the Revised Penal Code on other acts of falsification not covered 
by the special law, since under Art. 10 of the Rev. Penal Code, it has 
supplementary application to all special laws, unless the latter should 
specially provide the contrary, and Commonwealth Act No. 465 makes no provision 
that it exclusively applies to all falsifications of residence certificates. 
Then, again, section 12 of Commonwealth Act No. 465 penalize <em>all other</em> 
violations of the residence certificate law not covered by the preceding 
sections thereof. Which law is applicable should be determined when the case is 
decided on its merits. At the present stflge of the proceedings, however, it can 
be stated that whether the crime charged be punishable under the Revised Penal 
Code, or sec. 12 of Comm. Act No, 465, the information was sufficient, and its 
dismissal for insufficiency by the Court below was improper and erroneous. The 
order of the trial court dismissing the information filed in this case is, 
therefore; reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court below for further 
proceedings, with costs against the defendant-appellee.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador</em> and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order reversed, case remanded to lower Court for further 
proceedings.</em></p></div>
