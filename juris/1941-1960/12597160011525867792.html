				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp;&nbsp; from the following&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Capiz&nbsp; dismissing the present case:<br><blockquote>"This is a petition for&nbsp; a reconsideration&nbsp; filed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Fiscal praying&nbsp; that tho ease be considered filed&nbsp; and given&nbsp; due&nbsp; course by this Court. , According to the said motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration,' the City Fiscal alleged that the accused has been given&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; be heard during the&nbsp; investigation;<br><br>"On the other hand, the&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; for the accused alleged that they&nbsp; were not given&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; be&nbsp; heard either&nbsp; in the preliminary examination&nbsp; before the issuance of the warrant of&nbsp; arrest or in the preliminary investigation of&nbsp; the ease before it was remitted to this Court.<br><br>"In order&nbsp; to&nbsp; give&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; who alleged that he had also&nbsp; a complaint&nbsp; for oral defamation against the offended party of&nbsp; this case&nbsp; so&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; determine&nbsp; which case&nbsp; has&nbsp; to&nbsp; be continued&nbsp; by the City Fiscal,&nbsp; this Court&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; to be remitted to tho lower&nbsp; court so as to&nbsp; perform again&nbsp; the&nbsp; preliminary examination&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the preliminary investigation, giving&nbsp; all the opportunities that the accused may&nbsp; like to interpose in these proceedings.<br><br>"On the other hand, the&nbsp; City Fiscal alleged that there was no need for him to conduct the&nbsp; preliminary examination because&nbsp; it is necessary, according to him, that&nbsp; the, accused has to prove that the case&nbsp; that he filed is worthless or the&nbsp; evidence is&nbsp; insufficient. The&nbsp; Court is of&nbsp; the opinion that the&nbsp; City Fiscal&nbsp; should investigate and&nbsp; examine these cases&nbsp; so as&nbsp; to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the filing&nbsp; of the present case. The only way to determine this fact is&nbsp; to make&nbsp; a&nbsp; rigid&nbsp; and&nbsp; careful&nbsp; examination of the witnesses of both&nbsp; cases&nbsp; so as to give justice to those who seek justice.&nbsp; There is nothing&nbsp; to lose, or somebody-prejudiced by the reinvestigation and&nbsp; reexamination but, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, not to give opportunity to the accused&nbsp; who&nbsp; has also a complaint filed before the City Fiscal&nbsp; is far&nbsp; from&nbsp; fair.&nbsp; It&nbsp; must be understood that in&nbsp; many decisions&nbsp; of the Supreme&nbsp; Court in the&nbsp; performance of the preliminary&nbsp; examination before the&nbsp; issuance of a warrant, the accused&nbsp; may be present or waive his right&nbsp; to be&nbsp; represented and&nbsp; once the , warrant&nbsp; of arrest&nbsp; is issued,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; is not allowed&nbsp; to cross-examine in the preliminary investigation&nbsp; of the witnesses for the&nbsp; government.&nbsp; If this is&nbsp; so, therefore,&nbsp; there is no opportunity&nbsp; for the&nbsp; accused to show&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; that all witnesses presented in&nbsp; the&nbsp; preliminary investigation&nbsp; are&nbsp; either&nbsp; invented and manufactured.&nbsp; The only remedy that ho has is to present&nbsp; his&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; preliminary investigation so&nbsp; as approve to the Court that&nbsp; he&nbsp; is innocent and in case found to&nbsp; be true, the case&nbsp; is&nbsp; dismissed.<br><br>"In view&nbsp; of the insistence of the&nbsp; City Fiscal in' his refusal to make further preliminary examination as well as&nbsp; to submit the case&nbsp; to&nbsp; preliminary investigation,&nbsp; the Court hereby order the dismissal of&nbsp; this" case, without cost."<br></blockquote>It appears&nbsp; that on&nbsp; October 1, 1953, the City Attorney of Roxas&nbsp; City, upon previous investigation&nbsp; of the merits of the case at the instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rosita&nbsp; de Fernandez, filed with the Municipal&nbsp; Court of Roxas&nbsp; City an information for&nbsp; Grave&nbsp; Oral&nbsp; Slander&nbsp; against&nbsp; the herein defendant-appellee Lourdes Ramilo.&nbsp; On the same date, the Municipal Judge&nbsp; issued the&nbsp; warrant&nbsp; for the arrest of the&nbsp; accused who&nbsp; immediately filed&nbsp; a bond&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of P1,000 for&nbsp; her provisional release.<br><br>On October&nbsp; 7, 1953,&nbsp; she was arraigned&nbsp; before the Municipal&nbsp; Court, pleaded not guilty and waived her&nbsp; right to preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same date the Municipal&nbsp; Court forwarded&nbsp; the&nbsp; record&nbsp; of the case to&nbsp; the court of First Instance of Capiz. On October 8, 1953, the City Attorney filed with the latter Court an information worded&nbsp; in the same manner as that filed in the&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; On November&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the case was&nbsp; called&nbsp; for the arraignment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused and&nbsp; on that day&nbsp; she&nbsp; appeared but instead&nbsp;&nbsp; of pleading&nbsp; guilty or not&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; to the&nbsp; charges&nbsp; against her,&nbsp; she, filed&nbsp; an urgent&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reinvestigation&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; case on the following&nbsp; grounds:<br><blockquote>"That, while the&nbsp; complaining&nbsp; witness in the above-entitled case was allowed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; heard by herself and her witnesses and&nbsp; even assisted&nbsp; by&nbsp; counsel, the&nbsp; above-named accused was not given&nbsp; the merest opportunity&nbsp; to bo present, heard and assisted by counsel at any time previous to the filing of this case by the prosecuting attorney&nbsp; of&nbsp; Roxas City;<br><br>"That&nbsp; the&nbsp; city&nbsp; prosecuting&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; ignored&nbsp; and&nbsp; disregarded facts and circumstances&nbsp; directly related to the above-entitled case which otherwise would have warranted the dismissal of the complaint filed by the complaining witness;<br><br>"That&nbsp; in obvious partiality&nbsp; towards the above-named&nbsp; accused, the prosecuting city attorney ignored&nbsp; and disregarded the complaint filed by the above-named accused presented by her against complainant" even previous&nbsp; to the complaint filed by the latter."<br></blockquote>Acting&nbsp; upon this&nbsp; motion,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Capiz entered the&nbsp; following order:<br><blockquote>"This is an&nbsp; urgent motion&nbsp; for reinvestigation alleging among other&nbsp; things&nbsp; that&nbsp; Attorney Francisco&nbsp; Fuentes,&nbsp; representing&nbsp; the accused, was not given opportunity to be present nor the accused was allowed to be&nbsp; assisted&nbsp; by&nbsp; any attorney during the investigation.&nbsp; In&nbsp; order to&nbsp; give&nbsp; every&nbsp; opportunity to the accused&nbsp; and for the sake&nbsp; of justice,&nbsp; this Court&nbsp; believes&nbsp; that the&nbsp; urgent motion is&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; and,&nbsp; therefore, should be given due&nbsp; course,<br><br>"In view of the&nbsp; foregoing consideration, the Court orders that this Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 1692 for Grave Oral Defamation be&nbsp; returned to the municipal court&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Roxas so that the same may be indorsed to the City&nbsp; Fiscal for&nbsp; further investigation&nbsp; of the case with the request and advice that if the reinvestigation e carried out, the attorney for the accused should&nbsp; he allowed to&nbsp; be present and at the same time be heard, and to&nbsp; admit and receive any evidence that&nbsp; she may present&nbsp; if she so desires."<br></blockquote>Accordingly, the case was sent back to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Court of&nbsp; the City&nbsp; of Roxas and&nbsp; indorsed by the latter to the City&nbsp; Attorney&nbsp; for further investigation.&nbsp; Complying with the order of the court, the City Attorney&nbsp; set the case&nbsp; for reinvestigation on&nbsp; November 18,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; but on that&nbsp; date the accused asked&nbsp; that the witnesses&nbsp; for the prosecution&nbsp; be first called&nbsp; for cross-examination&nbsp; and&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; submit to&nbsp; the reinvestigation&nbsp; unless&nbsp; she&nbsp; could cross-examine them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; City Attorney&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; yield to this petition, closed the reinvestigation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on November&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1953&nbsp; returned the record&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; to the. Court of First Instance and immediately&nbsp; thereafter filed a&nbsp; motion praying&nbsp; that&nbsp; the case be. given&nbsp; due course on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp;&nbsp; that there&nbsp; is&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; to warrant. the&nbsp; conviction of the accused.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied by&nbsp; the Court in&nbsp; its&nbsp; order of November 24, 1953,&nbsp; worded as follows:<br><blockquote>"Upon petition of the City Attorney&nbsp; praying that this&nbsp; case&nbsp; be considered, the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; denies&nbsp; the said&nbsp; petition inasmuch as the said&nbsp; case is concerned it&nbsp; was already&nbsp; finished in the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance.<br><br>"Therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; hereby remits this case&nbsp; to the Justice of the Peace of the City of Roxas."<br></blockquote>On&nbsp; December&nbsp; 5, 1953,&nbsp; the City&nbsp; Attorney petitioned the Court that the preceding Order be set aside&nbsp; and that the ease&nbsp; be&nbsp; given&nbsp; due&nbsp; course,&nbsp;&nbsp; among&nbsp; other&nbsp; things,&nbsp; on the ground that: <br><blockquote>"That when&nbsp; this case was&nbsp; called for&nbsp; arraignment of "the&nbsp; accused on November 9,&nbsp; 1953, this Honorable Court set aside the&nbsp; arraignment of the&nbsp; said accused and proceeded to hear the urgent motion for&nbsp; reinvestigation&nbsp; filed that&nbsp; same morning by&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; of the accused without serving copy of&nbsp; the same&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; undersigned;<br><br>"That the undersigned objected to the granting of the petition for reinvestigation&nbsp; on the following&nbsp; grounds:<br><br>"1. That the accused has&nbsp; been granted the&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to be heard&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation;<br><br>"2. That under Section&nbsp; II, Rule 108&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court, prior to her arrest she has&nbsp; not&nbsp; the absolute right to&nbsp; participate in the investigation&nbsp; conducted by the undersigned;<br><br>"3. Under&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Rule after her arrest and&nbsp; delivery to the court&nbsp; the&nbsp; only right of&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused is to&nbsp; be informed&nbsp; of the substance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; and evidence presented against her and if she desires&nbsp; to testify and to&nbsp; present witnesses or evidence in her favor; but accused in the above-entitled case waived her&nbsp; right to the&nbsp; preliminary investigation, as shown by the records of the case.<br><br>"That notwithstanding these objections&nbsp; of&nbsp; the undersigned,&nbsp; this Honorable&nbsp; Court&nbsp; granted&nbsp; the&nbsp; said motion&nbsp; for reinvestigation; "That pursuant to this order of this Honorable Court the undersigned&nbsp; scheduled for&nbsp; reinvestigation the above&nbsp; entitled case&nbsp; on November 18, 1953,&nbsp; in order to&nbsp; give opportunity&nbsp; for the&nbsp; accused to show those&nbsp; facts&nbsp; and circumstances mentioned in her&nbsp; motion for reinvestigation which would warrant the dismissal of this case and&nbsp; which were allegedly&nbsp; ignored by the undersigned;<br><br>"That counsel of accused refused&nbsp; to allow&nbsp; the accused and her witnesses&nbsp; to&nbsp; submit to the reinvestigation&nbsp; unless&nbsp; the undersigned produces before said counsel&nbsp; all&nbsp; the witnesses of the prosecution so that he can cross-examine them;<br><br>"That undersigned refused to accede&nbsp; to these demands without the&nbsp; accused and her counsel first showing that the case filed lacks merit; <br><br>"That, the merits of the case as filed&nbsp; not having been disturbed, the&nbsp; undersigned accordingly filed a motion before&nbsp; this&nbsp; Honorable Court&nbsp; on November 10,&nbsp; 1953, to consider the above entitled case filed and to give&nbsp; due&nbsp; course&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; same;<br><br>"That this Honorable Court in its order of November 24, 1953, denied&nbsp; this petition of the undersigned alleging&nbsp; that&nbsp; tho.&nbsp; above entitled&nbsp; case, insofar&nbsp; as&nbsp; this Honorable&nbsp; Court&nbsp; is&nbsp; concerned&nbsp; is already finished;<br><br>"That the aforementioned order of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Honorable.&nbsp; Court&nbsp; is contrary to&nbsp; law&nbsp; and&nbsp; procedure; this&nbsp;&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Court having disposed of&nbsp; the above entitled&nbsp; case by means of the&nbsp; order for reinvestigation and not upon trial on the merits;&nbsp; and,<br><br>"Granting arguendo that the&nbsp; accused was deprived of her&nbsp; right to participate to&nbsp; the preliminary investigation, such&nbsp; deprivation will&nbsp; not warrant the dismissal of the ease as decided&nbsp; by the Supreme Court in the case&nbsp; of Gabino Lozada <i> vs. </i> The&nbsp; Honorable Fernando Hernandez, respondent, G.&nbsp; R.&nbsp; No. L-6177 which held:<br><br>'It has been said time and again that a preliminary investigation is not properly a trial or any part thereof hut is merely preparatory thereto, its only purpose being to determine whether there is probable cause to believe the accused guilty thereof, (U. S. <i>vs.</i> Yu Tuico,&nbsp; 34 Phil. 209;&nbsp; People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Badilla,. 48 Phil.&nbsp; 718).&nbsp; The&nbsp; right to such investigation is not a fundamental right guaranteed&nbsp; by the constitution. At most,&nbsp; it is statutory."</blockquote>On&nbsp; December&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp;&nbsp; Instance denied this motion and&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; the case&nbsp; allegedly "in view of the insistence of&nbsp; the City Fiscal in&nbsp; his refusal to make further preliminary examination as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; to submit the case&nbsp; to&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation."<br><br>It is contended&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred&nbsp; "in not giving&nbsp; due course to&nbsp; the&nbsp; information&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Attorney for&nbsp; grave&nbsp; oral defamation against the&nbsp; accused Lourdes&nbsp; Ramilo&nbsp; and&nbsp; in dismissing the case."&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; find this contention&nbsp; to be&nbsp; well taken.&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, because&nbsp; after the&nbsp; filing&nbsp; of the information by&nbsp; the City Attorney with the&nbsp; Municipal Court of the City&nbsp; of Itaas and&nbsp; after the issuance&nbsp; of the warrant of&nbsp; arrest, the&nbsp; accused filed&nbsp; a bond for her&nbsp; temporary&nbsp; release and&nbsp;&nbsp; when the&nbsp; case&nbsp; was set&nbsp; for&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation before that&nbsp; court,&nbsp; she, assisted by her counsel, having been informed of the&nbsp; nature of the charge against&nbsp; her,&nbsp; pleaded not&nbsp; guilty and explicitly&nbsp; waived her&nbsp; right&nbsp; to a preliminary investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the case was to be reinvestigated by the City Attorney pursuant to the order of the Court of First Instance, the&nbsp; accused, instead of submitting&nbsp; her evidence, demanded that the&nbsp; witnesses for the prosecution be' recalled&nbsp; for cross, examination&nbsp; and refused to&nbsp; continue with&nbsp; the&nbsp; reinvestigation&nbsp; when her demand&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied by&nbsp; the City&nbsp; Attorney&nbsp; who&nbsp; had&nbsp; to forward&nbsp; the&nbsp; record of the case to the: Court of. First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; for trial&nbsp; on the merits.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; could&nbsp; readily&nbsp; be seen&nbsp; that&nbsp; 'Ike&nbsp; accused has been given&nbsp; all the opportunity to present&nbsp; her side of the case with the assistance of counsel not only in the preliminary investigation&nbsp; before the Municipal Court&nbsp; but also during the&nbsp; reinvestigation&nbsp; conducted by the&nbsp; City Attorney&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; the order of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; She cannot&nbsp; therefore now claim that&nbsp; she was deprived&nbsp; of her&nbsp; right to preliminary&nbsp; investigation.&nbsp; If there has been no such preliminary investigation,&nbsp; it was because she explicitly waived her right thereto when&nbsp; she was arraigned for that purpose in the Municipal Court, and when the case was to be reinvestigated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the City Attorney, she made an illegal demand instead of submitting her evidence.<br><br>Section&nbsp; 11 of Rule&nbsp; 108 of&nbsp; the Rules&nbsp; of Court&nbsp; clearly provides:<br><blockquote>"Alter&nbsp; the arrest of the, defendant&nbsp; and&nbsp; his delivery to&nbsp; the court,&nbsp; he shall he&nbsp; informed of the complaint or information&nbsp; filed against him.&nbsp; He shall also be informed&nbsp; oJ the substance of&nbsp; the testimony and evidence presented against him,&nbsp; and, if&nbsp; he&nbsp; desires to testify or to present witnesses or evidence in his&nbsp; favor,, he&nbsp; may be allowed to do so. The&nbsp; testimony of the witnesses need not be reduced to writing but that&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; shall be taken in writing and&nbsp; subscribed by him:"<br></blockquote>From the aforequoted provision of law, the rights of a defendant after&nbsp; his arrest are (1)&nbsp; to be&nbsp; informed of the complaint or information filed&nbsp; against&nbsp; him&nbsp; and&nbsp; of the substance of the testimony and evidence presented against him;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; to be allowed, if he so desires,&nbsp; to&nbsp; testify or to present witnesses of&nbsp; evidence in his favor.&nbsp; As of right,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; in&nbsp; a preliminary investigation,&nbsp; an accused is not entitled to cross-examine the witnesses presented&nbsp; against&nbsp; him.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; the&nbsp; demand of the&nbsp; herein accused during&nbsp; the reinvestigation conducted by the City Attorney&nbsp; that the witnesses&nbsp; for the prosecution&nbsp; be recalled&nbsp; so&nbsp; that&nbsp; she&nbsp; could&nbsp; cross-examine them&nbsp; was&nbsp; not based&nbsp; on&nbsp; any provision&nbsp; of law&nbsp; and therefore&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Attorney of Roxas City has correctly denied such demand. Wherefore, the aforequoted order appealed from is here- by revoked and the Court <i>a quo</i> ordered to proceed with the trial of the case on its merit.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Parás, C.
