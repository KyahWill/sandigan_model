				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. ELIGIO JIMENEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Zambales, declaring the appellant Eligio Jimenez  guilty of murder and sentencing him  to  death,  to indemnify  the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P6,000, and  to pay the  costs.</p>
<p>It appears from the evidence that about 10 o'clock  in the  evening  of  April 3, 1952, while the now  deceased Nicolas de los Reyes was resting on  the floor of the hut of his father-in-law Jose Madriaga in sitio Cruz, municipality of  San Narciso,  Zambales, the appellant Jimenez burst into  the hut and all of a sudden and without warning  attacked him with  a bolo.  Jose  Madriaga was  at the time out in his farm; but in the hut with the deceased were the latter's wife Rosalina  Madriaga, who  was then nursing her  baby, her  other child,  9-year  old  Erlinda, who  was  lying  beside her,  and her stepmother,  Laura Lavandelo, Jose  Madriaga's wife, who  was then busy doing the  dishes.  Seized  by fear,  Rosalina and  Laura gathered the children and fled to  a distant  place  and did not come back to the hut until the following morning.</p>
<p>When Jose Madriaga returned to his hut later  in the evening he found nobody there except the appellant Jimenez  who,   bolo  in hand, was standing  near  the  door. Pointing to a sack, which had its  open end tied, Jimenez told  Madriaga that the remains  of his son-in-law were  in said  sack,  and Madriaga noticed  that the sack, as well as Jimenez's bolo, was  smeared  with  blood,  and that blood, was  also splattered on the floor.  Jimenez said that he had killed the  deceased and threatened that  he  would kill all of  them  if Madriaga did not do as he  was told. Madriaga,  therefore, had to obey  when Jimenez ordered him  to load the sack on a cart, and the two of them then took the cart to  a place about two kilometers away  where Jimenez dumped the sack with its contents into an abandoned well, which was surrounded with  vegetation,  and thereafter  warned Madriaga not to divulge what he had seen  for otherwise he would kill  him.</p>
<p>When Rosalina came back to the hut the next day, she related to her father, Jose Madriaga, what had happened the night before, and Madriaga on his part, taking courage despite appellant's threat, later reported  the killing to the Constabulary.</p>
<p>Going to the well indicated by Madriaga, the authorities were  able  to  fish from the water  of .the  well  the  sack before-mentioned,  which, on being opened, was  found to contain a more or less  complete human skeleton but minus the skull.  Examining the bones, Dr. P. Guerrero, of the Second Sanitary Division, noticed that the clavicle  and certain bones of the breast and some ribs had been severed with a cutting instrument and the  doctor gave  it as his opinion that before the  corpse was placed in  the  sack it had already been dismembered.  Madriaga said  that the bones  were those  of his  son-in-law.</p>
<p>Testifying in his own defense, appellant Jimenez denied having had any part in the killing and declared that from 5 o'clock  p.m.  of April 3,  1952, the day the crime was committed, he did not  leave his house.   His testimony, however, is uncorroborated, and it appears that the house where he stayed was only about 80 meters from the scene of the crime.   His alibi is thus  rather weak  and cannot prevail over the testimony of eyewitnesses to the crime.</p>
<p>The case hinges on credibility,  and we find no  good reason, after  going  over the evidence, for not accepting the finding below that appellant was the one who killed the deceased.  The  finding  is clearly  supported  by the combined testimony of Rosalina Madriaga, Erlinda de  los Reyes, Laura Lavandelo and Jose Madriaga.  The contradictions  or inconsistencies  which the  attorney  de oficio has noted in the testimony of the witnesses refer to mere details and do not necessarily  cast  suspicion  on their credibility.  And it may be added that at least in the case of Rosalina, who, it would appear, was sustaining illicit relations with appellant, nothing has been shown which would  make it likely for her to impute  to him  a crime he had not really committed.</p>
<p>As found by  the trial court, the crime was  motivated by  appellant's desire "to possess  freely and  exclusively" the wife of the  deceased, there being clear evidence that she  was his paramour, for which reason the husband, obviously suspicious of what was  going on, tried  to take her  to  another  barrio  or town while  she, on  her part, tried to separate  from her husband  but was  dissuaded from doing so  by her relatives.   We find the evidence on  this motive to be sufficiently clear  despite the wife's attempt  at the  trial  to hide her  shame by  saying that she believed the reason why appellant killed her husband was because the latter accused him in the  presence  of many persons of stealing their clothes.</p>
<p>The defense tried  to show that Nicolas de  los Reyes had joined the Huks and was still alive.  But the evidence on this point is  unconvincing and was probably presented with the idea of casting some doubt on the built of the accused.</p>
<p>The crime committed is murder qualified by  treachery and aggravated by the circumstance  of dwelling.  We cannot accept the finding that the crime was committed with  evident premeditation, nighttime and cruelty since there is no clear evidence as to the first, the second is inherent in treachery, and the third is not to  be inferred from the fact alone that the body of the deceased was dismembered in  the absence of proof  that this  was done while the deceased was still alive.  There being no mitigating circumstances to  offset  the  aggravating circumstance of dwelling, the  penalty prescribed by law is  death.  But for lack of sufficient votes to impose that penalty, appellant is  sentenced only to life imprisonment, plus  the indemnity imposed below and costs.</p>
<p>Modified accordingly, the judgment  of conviction  appealed from  is  affirmed, with  costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
