				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is  an  appeal  from  the decision of the Court  of First Instance of Pangasinan of April 28, 1956, dismissing the petition  for prohibition filed by appellants, lifting the preliminary  injunction against  the appellees and ordering the removal  of appellants' stalls from the public plaza of appellee municipality, within ten days from notice.  Pending appeal,  counsel for  the appellees  filed a  <span style="font-style: italic;">Manifestation</span> on  September 16,  1957,  copy of which was duly served on appellants, that  several months  after the  oral argument held before this Tribunal on January 25, 1957, appellants had voluntarily vacated the public plaza of Pozorrubio by transferring and removing their buildings and merchandise therefrom to private lots  fronting the  plaza; and that the municipality had already begun the construction of concrete fences in the premises, formerly occupied by  appellants, without  any  complaint whatsoever  from them or their counsel; and that  consequently, the present case has become moot and  academic, and asking that the present appeal be dismissed.   By resolution of this Court of October 21, 1957, appellants were required to comment on   this   <span style="font-style: italic;">Manifestation</span>  and  petition  for   dismissal, within ten days from notice.  Despite notice of this resolution,  appellants failed to file  the required comment.  For this reason, we could well  summarily dismiss this appeal by resolution.  However, for the  satisfaction of the parties and for possible guidance of town officials and residents, we  have  deemed it  convenient  and necessary  to decide the case by  formal decision. <br><br>The facts  are  not disputed.   In fact, no evidence was submitted at the  hearing before the trial court, the parties having petitioned that the case be decided on the pleadings. During the last  world  war,  the market  building of  the town of Pozorrubio was destroyed, and after Liberation, the market  vendors began constructing temporary  and make-shift stalls, even small residences, on a portion  of the town  plaza.  The Municipal  Treasurer collected from these stall owners fees at the  rate of P.25  per square meter a month.  In time, the whole municipal market was rehabilitated,  but the  owners of  the   structures  on  the plaza failed and  refused to transfer to said market place. <br><br>The Municipal Council of Pozorrubio received petitions from civic organizations like the Woman's  Club and  the Puericulture  Center, for the removal of the market stalls on  the  plaza, which  were being used  not only as stalls, but also for residence purposes, said organizations desiring to convert said portion of the plaza into a children's park. The Provincial Board of Pangasinan had also presented to the Council the petition of another  civic organization of Pozorrubio, asking for  the removal of the stalls from the  plaza, and the attention of the Council was also called to the letter-circular of the Secretary of the Interior about the existence of these stalls on the public plaza, said to be illegal. <br><br>As a result, the Municipal Council of Pozorrubio passed Resolution No. 209, Series of 1951, stating that the public market had  already been rehabilitated, and ordering the occupants  and owners  of the structures  on the plaza to remove their buildings within  sixty  days  from receipt of  the resolution.  In answer  to this  resolution,   eight of the market stall building owners filed  a petition for prohibition in the  Court  of  First Instance of Pangasinan against the Municipal Council,  the Municipal Mayor, and the Chief of Police of Pozorrubio.  Pending hearing, the trial court issued  a writ  of  preliminary injunction. <br><br>The trial  court  found  that the fee of P.25 per square meter  collected by the Municipal Treasurer, was not for the  rent of  the portion  of  the public plaza occupied by the  market  stalls, as claimed  by  appellants,  but rather the market stall fees  charges on all market vendors in a public market; and that  there  was absolutely no contract or agreement between the appellants on one side and the municipality on the other, about renting of the Plaza to the former.  There is reason to believe that the occupation of the plaza and the construction  of temporary buildings thereon by appellants mostly for market,  even residence  purposes, was merely tolerated by the municipality, because of the destruction of the public market  during the war, but the  trouble  is that appellants,  even  after the rehabilitation of the  old market,  refused  to  transfer to said market  place,  perhaps to save the trouble and expense of  transferring their buildings, or possibly to continue enjoying the benefits  from the  strategic position of their stalls  at the plaza. There is absolutely no question that the  town  plaza cannot  be  used for the  construction of market stalls, specially of residences, and that such structures constitute a nuisance subject to abatement according to law.  Town  plazas  are properties of public  dominion, to be devoted to public use and to be made available  to the public in general.  They are outside  the commerce of man and cannot be disposed of or even  leased by the municipality to private parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  While in case of war  or during an emergency, town plazas may be  occupied temporarily  by private individuals, as was done and as was tolerated  by the  Municipality of Pozorrubio, when the emergency has ceased, said temporary occupation or use must also cease, and the town  officials should see to  it that  the  town  plazas  should ever  be kept open to the public and free from  encumbrances or illegal  private constructions. <br><br>Appellants must have realized the absolute lack of merit in their  stand  and the futility  of their appeal because they voluntarily removed their buildings on  the plaza.  As a matter of fact,  after the filing of the prohibition with the trial court, two out of  the eight petitioners informed the trial court that they were included as petitioners without their consent, and so asked that they be  excluded from the case. In  view of the foregoing, the decision  appealed from is hereby affirmed.   With costs against  appellants. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
