				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. SEVERO BASCON (ALIAS KID MORO), DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Severo Bascon <i>alias</i> "Kid Moro" is appealing from a 
decision of the People's Court finding him guilty of treason and sentencing him 
to life imprisonment, to pay a fine of P1,000, and to pay the costs.
<p align="justify">Out of the three counts included in the information, evidence 
was submitted to support only one, namely, Count No. 1 which we reproduce below 
for purposes of reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. That during the Japanese occupation, in the City of Cebu, 
Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the accused herein 
with intent to give aid and comfort to the enemy above-mentioned, did then and 
there willfully, illegally, feloniously and treasonably act as a spy and/or 
undercover agent for the Japanese Military Police known as Kempei Tai and as 
such, did arrest, apprehend and identify guerrillas and other persons, engaged 
in the resistance movement far the Kempei Tai, torturing and maltreating persons 
thus arrested by him and did furnish valuable military information regarding 
guerrillas and the USAFFE to the Japanese Imperial Forces;"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">By his own admission the appellant Severo Bascon <i>alias</i> 
"Kid Moro" is a Filipino citizen.</p>
<p align="justify">From a careful study of fee evidence on record we find the 
following facts to have been duly established:</p>
<p align="justify">On May 3, 1943, while Inocencia Mabini and Cristobal Cortes, a 
cousin of her father, were walking along T. Padilla Street, Cebu City, they met 
a party of two Japanese soldiers and three Filipinos, among the latter being the 
appellant who was at that time armed with a revolver land one named Turang who 
forthwith pointed to Cristobal as a guerrilla soldier. As a matter of fact, at 
the time, Cristobal was a sergeant in the guerrilla forces in the province of 
Cebu, aid he had gone to the city upon instructions of his superior officers to 
procure foodstuffs. Bascon immediately arrested. Cristobal and he and Inocencia 
were taken to Tisa, in Mabolo where they were questioned and searched. The party 
or group of which the appellant was a member wanted information about the 
guerrilla activities and also wanted to get a revolver whieh they were informed 
was kept by Cristobal. The two Japanese and the three Filipinos then took 
Inocencia and Cristobal to Inocencia's house in General Loriga Street, Cebu 
City, where in order to obtain the information needed Cristobal was severely 
maltreated by the group including Bascon. Cristobal was punched, beaten and 
strangled until he finally revealed that he had given his revolver to Inocencia 
to hide for him. In ransacking the house, Bascon found the revolver in the 
kitchen under the stove where Inocencia had hidden it. These facts were 
testified to by Inocencia and were corroborated by her younger sister Cristina 
Mabini who was in the house when her sister and Cristobal arrived accompanied by 
the group. Cristina further told the court that during the torture of Cristobal 
the appellant was laughing, and at one time it was he who inserted bullets 
between the fingers of Cristobal,â€”a form of torture of common knowledge, 
sometimes resorted to, by inserting bullets between the fingers and later 
squeezing the hand to cause intense pain. Afterwards, Inocencia and Cristobal 
were taken to the Military Police headquarters in the City where they were kept 
for forty-seven days. The evidence further show that after tills release, 
Cristobal wast later killed by the Japanese in Binalid, and so was unable to 
testify during the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">The evidence further discloses that about August 4, 1944, a 
group of five Japanese and six Filipinos among the latter being the appellant 
Bascon and one Pat. Romales went to the house of Gerardo Ouano located near the 
seashore in barrio Opao, Mandaue, Cebu. At the time Bascon was armed with a 
revolver. The group was looking for firearms and guerrilla soldiers. The whole 
house was ransacked by Pat. Romales and "Kid Moro" and even a locked cabinet was 
opened and searched after the key to it had been taken from Jovita Ouano, 
Gerardo's daughter. The men of the household specially Gerardo and his servant 
Gonzalo Dacuya were maltreated by beating them with the butt of a, revolver, and 
as to Dacuya the group even inserted the barrel of the revolver in his mouth 
apparently, in an endeavor to frighten him. As a result of the search, only a 
toy gun was found. The group arrived at the house about 10 o'clock in the 
morning and left only about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. When they left they took 
with them Gerardo, his son Alfredo Ouano and Gonzalo Dacuya. To these facts 
Gonzalo Dacuya, a servant and Lazaro Jerosa, a laborer of Gerardo employed by 
him in his salt beds, testified. Dacuya further told the court that he and his 
master Gerardo and Alfredo were taken to the San Carlos Building, City of Cebu 
and there kept for two and a half days. During said period Gerardo and Alfredo 
remained tied while he (Dacuya) was suspended in mid air and otherwise tortured 
so much that after his release he was unable to devote himself to work for a 
period of four (4) months and that even on the day of the tidal which took place 
more, than two (2) years after his torture, he still felt pains in his back. 
Dacuya also told the court that Gerardo was already dead and so was unable to 
testify during the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no doubt in the mind of the Court as to the guilt of 
the appellant of foe crime of treason. By his acts and conduct duly proven 
during the trial, he, a Filipino owing allegiance to the United States and to 
the Government of the Philippine Islands adhered to and aided the Government of 
Japan represented by its invading and occupation forces in the Province of Cebu, 
by accompanying and helping them in confiscating firearms and obtaining 
information about the whereabouts, strength, and activities of the guerrilla 
forces by freely using force, intimidation and torture.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellant was a boxer and before the war, had fought in the 
ring under the name "Kid Moro". So, he was well-known in the City of Cebu. He 
was married to a Japanese woman who according to the evidence and by the very 
admission of the appellant, was employed by the Japanese as an interpreter. This 
fact, of course, does not and cannot affect the innocence or guilt of Bascon. 
Neither does it influence this Court in passing upon the merits of the appeal, 
although, it may perhaps serve as an indication or reason why the appellant had 
such sympathy for the Japanese to the extent of going against his own 
people.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellant claims that after liberation he was investigated 
by the C.I.C. (Counter Intelligence Corps of the United States liberation forces) 
and was cleared by it and given clearance papers. However, he was unable to 
produce such alleged clearance papers in support of his claim, saying that he 
had lost them. He further told the court that notwithstanding the clearance 
given him by the CIC, the guerrillas of Cebu were after him, so much so that for 
his own safety he preferred to stay and in fact, stayed in prison and under 
custody. If this is true, it is indicative of the hostile feeling in the 
community against the appellant for being an all-out pro Japanese, arming 
himself with a revolver and accompanying and helping the Japanese soldiers in 
their frequent raids and searches, torturing Filipinos suspected of concealing 
firearms or possessing information about the guerrillas or actually being 
connected with them.</p>
<p align="justify">In conclusion, we find that the guilt of the appellant has been 
established beyond reasonable doubt. The decision being in accordance with law 
and supported by evidence, the same is hereby affirmed with costs against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon,</i> and 
<i>Tuazon, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p align="justify">PERFECTO,<i> J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant is entitled to acquittal upon two grounds, 
namely:</p>
<ol><li>Because not a single overt act has been proved under the two-witness rule of 
article 114 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>
</li><li>Because not one of the two overt acts attempted to be proved by the 
prosecution is alleged in the information. </li></ol>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p align="justify">The first overt act sought to be proved by the prosecution is 
the appellant's alleged participation in the arrest of Cristobal Cortes and 
Inocencia Mabini at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of May 3, 1943.</p>
<p align="justify">The sisters Inocencia Mabini and Cristina Mabini are the only 
witnesses called to testify on the arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">Inocencia testified that the arrest took place at P. Padilla 
St., Cebu City. (2, 3 and 8).</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Question: Now who were present during that arrests? Were there 
any person present during that arrest?</p>
<p align="justify">"Answer: There were plenty of people because it was in P. 
Padilla, <i>but I did not know them</i>." (7).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Cristina agreed that the apprehension took place at P. Padilla 
St. (2 and 5) adding that it took place at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon of 
May 3, 1943. (7). But at the time she was, in her own words, "in my house, at 
Gen. Loriga St." (5, 6). But during the whole day and night she remained in her 
house at said street.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Question: <i>On May 3, 1943, where were you</i>?</p>
<p align="justify">"Answer: <i>In my house</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">"Question: What do you mean? <i>Do you mean to say that you 
stayed in your house from morning until night, you did not go somewhere</i>?</p>
<p align="justify">"Answer: <i>Yes sir</i>." (6)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">It is evident, therefore, that as to the arrest at P. Padllla 
St., there is on record only the testimony of Inocencia Mabini.</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, according to Inocencia, the one who was arrested with 
her, was Cortes, but according to Cristina the one arrested was Ortiz. (3).</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p align="justify">The second overt act attributed to the accused is his alleged 
participation in the arrest at 2 o'clock in the afternoon of Gerardo Ouano, 
Alfredo Ouano and Gonzalo Dacuya.</p>
<p align="justify">Two witnesses were called to testify on the alleged arrest: 
Gonzalo Dacuya and Lazaro Jerosa. Putting aside the discrepancies between the 
two witnesses, we will deal only with the important detail as to the date of the 
arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">Dacuya said that the arrest took place in his house in Mandawe 
"in August, 1944." (1). He did not mention the date of the arrest.</p>
<p align="justify">Jerosa testified that the arrest took place in the "first week 
of August, 1944, (11) on August 4, 1944." (12).</p>
<p align="justify">From the foregoing, it appears that only a witness testified as 
to the arrest on August 4, 1944. No other witness testified as to the arrest on 
said date. The testimony of Dacuya that the arrest took place in August, 1944, 
does not satisfy the two-witness rule.</p>
<p align="justify">When Dacuya mentioned August, he, in fact, mentioned thirty-one 
days, the number of days of said month. The possibility that he could refer to 
August 4 is against thirty other possibilities, from August 1 to 31. This 
conflict of possibilities, in view of the legal presumption of innocence, has to 
be resolved in favor of appellant who, in addition, is overwhelmingly favored by 
a ratio of 30 to 1.</p>
<div align="center">III </div>
<p align="justify">The fact that not one of said overt acts has been proved under 
the two-witness rule can be emphasized by the circumstance that not one of the 
above two overt acts has been and is alleged in the information.</p>
<p align="justify">This omission in the information shows that at the time the 
same was filed, the prosecution did not have the least idea of the two arrests. 
Otherwise, it would have not failed to mention them specifically, as it did in 
count 2 of the information, where it is stated that appellant apprehended and 
shot to death a guerrilla soldier named Pedro Maglasan.</p>
<p align="justify">However, not a single bit of evidence has been presented or 
offered to prove the alleged arrest and killing of Pedro Maglasan. No 
explanation has been given why no such evidence has been presented. No 
explanation has been given why, in a move of surprise, the prosecution instead 
offered evidence of the two arrests above discussed.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant cannot be convicted legally of said two arrests, upon 
which he has not been duly informed by proper allegations in the information. 
Appellant was entitled, as a matter of constitutional right (Art. III, secs. 
1-17 of the Constitution), to be informed of the nature of the specific crime 
imputed to him. This constitutional right has been denied to him.</p>
<p align="justify">A trial is not a game of chance. It is not a bout of fencing 
where opponents are entitled to all ruses, deceptions and surprises. It is not a 
heartless war in which belligerents may resort to treachery, like the 
treacherous Pearl Harbor attack. Because the purpose of a court trial is to 
administer justice, it has to be fair, and it has not to be decided on the 
cunning of litigants and lawyers who thrust their foils against unguarded 
opponents, but on the merits of a controversy in which all the cards have to be 
laid on the table honestly and even in a true Christian spirit.</p>
<div align="center">CONCLUSION </div>
<p align="justify">All the foregoing show that the only alternative for this Court 
in this case is to reverse the appealed.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISIDENTE</i></p>
<p align="justify">BRIONES, <i>M.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">Creo que el apelante debe ser absuelto por no haber 83 prqbado 
la acusacion contra 61 fuera de toda duda razonable.</p>
<p align="justify">Se formularon los cargos contra el acusado enuna poca engue los 
prejuicios sobre la colaboracidn con los japoneses eran muy pronunciados y los 
guerrilleros, unos genuinos y otros falsos, vefan un traldor en eada vecino de 
conducta. algiln tanto sospeehosa durante. la ooupacidn, En el caso. particular 
del acusado y apelante Ostos prejuicios se habrn acentuado por estar el misino 
casado: con una mujer nacidaen Hawaii de padres japoneses, si bien ciudadana 
americana, segiin alegacidn no impugnada. En algunas ocasiones esta mujer fu6 
utilizaia por los niilitares japoneses icomo interprete, en ausencia del que 
regularmente desempenaba este oficio.</p>
<p align="justify">Es harto signif icativo el; neclio de que habi ndose fiormulado 
en la querella tres cargos contra el acusado, doa se sobreseyeron por no 
liaberse presentado. sobre los mismos ninguna prueba. Without any evidence on 
record to prove the charges under counts Nos. 2 and 3. dice el Tribunal del 
Pueblo en su. sentencia. No prueba esto, por lo fienos, la Tigereza conque se 
redactd y presentb, querella.</p>
<p align="justify">Otra cifcunstanci'a que milita en fayor del acusado vj le hace 
acreVdor v a los beneficios de una duda razonble es el liaber sido investigado 
inmediatamente despuds de la liberacion por agentes de la 010, entre ellos un 
teniente americano. llamado Greenwall, saliendo exonerado de dioiia 
Investigacidn. Sin embargo, por consejo del mismo Greenwall el acusado isrefirid 
continual detenido para su propia seguridad personal, pues los guerrilleros le 
miraban mal y temfa que le hiciesen dailo Entre la imparcialidad de los agentes 
de la CIC y el apaslo namiento de los guerrilleros, opto por lo primero.</p>
<p align="justify">Es verdad que el acusado no pudo presentar en la vista los 
papeles que acreditaban su ezoneracidn, pero explica esta omisidn dioiendo que 
los habla perdido en unp de sus traslados. De todas maneras no hay en autos 
ninguna prueba tendente a refutar el liecho de la referida exoneracion.</p></div>
