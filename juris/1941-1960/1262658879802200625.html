				<H3>MANILA  LIGHTER  TRANSPORTATION, INC., PETITIONER  AND APPELLANT, VS. THE MUNICIPAL BOARD, THE CITY TREASURER,  AND  THE  CITY  MAYOR,  ALL  OF  THE CITY OF CAVITE, RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Cavite upholding the validity of an ordinance enacted&nbsp; by the Municipal Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City of Cavite which imposes an annual license tax of P400 upon marine shops located in&nbsp; said city.<br><br>Appellant is&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; engaged in the&nbsp; lighterage and water transportation business&nbsp; and in connection with that business it runs&nbsp; a marine shop in the city of Cavite for the repairs of its own lighters and barges.&nbsp; Having been&nbsp; required&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the annual&nbsp; license&nbsp; tax&nbsp; on. the said shop&nbsp; under the&nbsp;&nbsp; ordinance&nbsp; above-mentioned,&nbsp; appellant brought&nbsp; an action for declaratory relief to challenge the validity of&nbsp; said ordinance&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground, among&nbsp; others, that it&nbsp; is&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; the power of the Municipal Board of Cavite to enact.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellees on the&nbsp; other hand contend that the ordinance is authorized by paragraphs (a.) and (p)&nbsp; of section 15 of the, city's charter&nbsp; (Commonwealth Act No. 547), which&nbsp; provide:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 15.&nbsp; <i>General powers and duties&nbsp; of the. Board.</i>—Except&nbsp; as otherwise provided by law, and subject to conditions and limitations thereof, the&nbsp; Municipal Board&nbsp; shall have the&nbsp; following legislative powers:<br><br>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; To provide for the levy and collection of taxes for&nbsp; general and special&nbsp; purposes in&nbsp; accordance with law including specifically the power to levy real&nbsp; property tax not to exceed two per cent ad <i>valorem.</i><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>(<i>p</i>) To tax, fix the license fee for, regulate the business and fix the location of, match factories, blacksmith shops, foundries, steam boilers, lumber yards, shipyards, the storage and sale of gunpowder, tar, pitch, resin, coal, oil, gasoline, benzine, turpentine, hemp, cotton, nitroglieerin, petroleum, or any of the products&nbsp; thereof, and of all other highly combustible or explosive materials, and other establishments likely to endanger the public safety or give rise to conflagrations or explosions,&nbsp; and, subject to the rules and regulations issued by the Director of&nbsp; Health in accordance with&nbsp; law, tanneries, renderies,&nbsp; tallow chandlerries,&nbsp; embalmers and&nbsp; funeral parlors, bone factories, and soap factories."<br></blockquote>Reading&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; provisions carefully,, we note&nbsp; that paragraph&nbsp; (<i>a</i>) merely expresses in&nbsp; a general&nbsp; way&nbsp; the city's&nbsp; authority1&nbsp; to&nbsp; levy.taxes&nbsp; for&nbsp; general&nbsp; and&nbsp; special purposes, which&nbsp; authority,&nbsp; so&nbsp; the paragraph&nbsp; says,&nbsp; must be&nbsp; exercised "in&nbsp; accordance with, law."&nbsp; In&nbsp; accordance with our decision in Icard vs. City of Baguio, 46 Off. Gaz. (Supp. No. 11) 320, to the effect that where the&nbsp; authority to tax is given in&nbsp; general&nbsp; terms .and subject to&nbsp; the qualification that&nbsp; the authority&nbsp; is to be exercised&nbsp; as&nbsp; provided&nbsp; by law,&nbsp; one&nbsp; must look&nbsp; elsewhere&nbsp; in the&nbsp; statute book for specific&nbsp; subjects of taxation, that is to&nbsp; say,&nbsp; for subjects specifically authorized&nbsp; by&nbsp; law to&nbsp; be taxed.&nbsp;&nbsp; In. the present case,&nbsp; those specific subjects—excepting realty which is already&nbsp; mentioned in the paragraph—are in fact enumerated&nbsp; in&nbsp; various paragraphs&nbsp; of section ,15, among ' them paragraph&nbsp; <i>(p</i>)&nbsp; above,&nbsp; which&nbsp; is the one&nbsp; applicable to the&nbsp; present&nbsp; case.<br><br>Now, going over paragraph&nbsp; (p),&nbsp; we&nbsp; find "shipyards" to be among the&nbsp; subjects of&nbsp; taxation therein enumerated, and&nbsp; since a shipyard is denned&nbsp; as&nbsp; a "yard, place&nbsp; or inclosure where&nbsp; ships&nbsp; are&nbsp; built&nbsp; or&nbsp; repaired"&nbsp; (Webster's International Dictionary,&nbsp; 2nd ed.), the&nbsp; term&nbsp; necessarily includes marine shops, such&nbsp; as&nbsp; those sought to&nbsp; be taxed by the ordinance in&nbsp; question which are. therein defined as&nbsp; "establishments engaged in the&nbsp; repair&nbsp; of boats&nbsp; and other marine and water crafts."<br><br>It is contended, however, that paragraph (p) authorizes the taxing of a shipyard only when it is conducted as&nbsp; a business, and in that connection it is; claimed&nbsp; that appellant's, marine shop is&nbsp; not in itself, a' business because it is devoted to&nbsp; the repair&nbsp; of its own watercraft only and does&nbsp; not accept work from others.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; find merit&nbsp; in this&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; Considering the&nbsp; amount of the charge&nbsp; imposed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinance—P400 yearly—and the fact that the ordinance itself calls it a tax, we are inclined&nbsp; to regard&nbsp; it as&nbsp; such and not as a&nbsp; mere fee for regulatory purposes&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with the,exercise of the police&nbsp; power.&nbsp; As a tax, it may be imposed by the . ordinance&nbsp; upon a shipyard only&nbsp; when this is operated as&nbsp; a business, that is to&nbsp; say, when it builds or repairs ships for others, but not when&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; devoted&nbsp; solely to the repair of the owner's own watercraft used by it in its&nbsp; lighterage&nbsp; and water transportation business,&nbsp; which already&nbsp; pays a tax of its own&nbsp; as such business.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Standard Vacuum Oil Company<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>. M.&nbsp; D. Antigua,&nbsp; et al., 96&nbsp; Phil., 909.)<br><br>The&nbsp; above&nbsp; conclusion,&nbsp; however, does not&nbsp; necessarily call for the invalidation of the questioned ordinance, but only for a declaration&nbsp; that&nbsp; appellant's marine&nbsp; shop in the City of Cavite—so&nbsp; long as it is not operated&nbsp; as a business—is not&nbsp; subject to the payment of the tax provided for in the ordinance. <br><br>As the evidence stands,&nbsp; we cannot say that during the period&nbsp; preceding&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint appellant's marine&nbsp; shop was engaged in building&nbsp; or&nbsp; repairing&nbsp; watercraft&nbsp; for&nbsp; others.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is affirmed in so much as&nbsp; it declares&nbsp; the ordinance in question&nbsp; valid." But.it&nbsp; is&nbsp; also&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; declared that appellant's marine shop in the City of Cavite is not&nbsp; subject to the tax. imposed by said&nbsp; ordinance so&nbsp; long&nbsp; as it is&nbsp; not&nbsp; operated as a business.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp;&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp;&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.
