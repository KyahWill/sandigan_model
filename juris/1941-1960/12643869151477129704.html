				<H3>JESUS AGUIRRE, PETITIONER, VS. HON. HIGINIO B. MACADAEG, AS  JUDGE  OF  THE  COURT  OF  FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, THE  SHERIFF OF MANILA AND LEONORA & COMPANY, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is  a petition for certiorari  and prohibition with preliminary injunction  filed by Jesus  Aguirre,  against respondent Judge Macadaeg of the Court of First Instance of Manila,  the  Sheriff of said city,  and Leonora &amp;  Company.  The petition was  given due  course  and a  writ of preliminary injunction was issued. <br><br>To better understand the background and basis of the present case, it is advisable to narrate some of the facts in two interrelated  cases  of the  lower court.  The National Shipyards and Steel Corporation, later referred to as the nassco, advertised  for the  purchase of  a secondhand belted steel tank  with capacity  of 210,000 gallons, through public bidding.  The Leonora &amp; Company, being the lowest bidder for the amount of P14,500, was awarded the bid, and on December 5,  1954,  it bought  a secondhand belted steel tank from Zosimo Gabriel, who previously had purchased  it from Vicente Aldaba and Teresa Aldaba on December 2, 1954.  It turned out, however, that before the Aldabas  sold the tank to  Gabriel, herein petitioner Aguirre had  bought the same tank from them  and paid the amount of P900 as  purchase price.  Aguirre  tried to take possession of the tank, but the Bureau  of Public Works filed a  claim to it and the municipal authorities of Los Banos where the tank was located, would  not allow Aguirre to take possession of the tank, much less  take  it away. This  was probably the  reason why the Aldabas made a second sale of the same tank  to Gabriel, who in turn made the sale to the  Leonora &amp;  Co. and the latter, after dismantling the same, buying spare  parts therefor and putting the tank in a useable  condition, could  deliver it to the  NASSCO, at Engineers Island, Manila, on December 20, 1954.  Aguirre  immediately filed formal  notice with the nassco of his rights and  claim of prior ownership and demanded suspension of payment by the nassco to Leonora &amp; Company, until the  question of ownership of the tank shall have been settled.   Aguirre  then filed a  complaint in the  Court of First Instance  of Manila, Civil Case No. 24914, against Leonora &amp; Company and the Aldabas for delivery to him of the tank,  with  damages. The  NASSCO suspended payment for the steel tank.  As a result of this  suspension of payment,  the Leonora &amp; Company,  through its manager,  filed  a complaint on Oc tober 24, 1955  against the NASSCO, to recover the amount of P14,500 for the purchase price  of the tank  or else to reimburse it in the  amount of P12,299, which allegedly represents the  actual investment and expenses  made and incurred by it  in  repairing the  tank and putting it in a useable condition,  plus damages and attorney's fees.  This case was  docketed as Civil Case No. 27988.   Aguirre was allowed to intervene  and he filed a complaint in intervention. <br><br>Civil Case No.  24914  was decided first  by  the lower court,  the dispositive part of which decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby declares Jesus Aguirre the absolute owner of the property  described  in his complaint.  The subsequent  sale made by defendants Aldaba to Zoshno Gabriel, the sale made  by Zosimo Gabriel to defendant Leonora and Co.; and the sale made  by defendant  Leonora and Co. to the National Shipyards and  Steel Corporation, are hereby declared null and void and of no effect.  Defendants Aldaba and Leonora and Co. and the National Shipyards and  Steel Corporation  are  hereby ordered to  deliver, to plaintiff Jesus  Aguirre  the tank  in question. Failure to make such delivery, defendant National Shipyards and Steel Corporation, in  whose possession  the tank is at present, shall pay to  the said  Jesus Aguirre the original purchase price of the tank in the amount of P900."</blockquote> It  would  appear  that this decision became final.   Then, on September 29,  1956, the same court  decided  Case  No. 27988, based on a  stipulation of  facts filed by the parties therein, including intervenor Aguirre.   After reproducing the said stipulation of facts and on the basis thereof, the court  rendered  decision thus:<br><blockquote>"In view of the foregoing agreement, judgment is hereby rendered as follows: <br><br>Intervenor Jesus Aguirre, as we have  already declared in Civil Case No. 24914, is hereby adjudged owner  of the oil tank  in question. Defendant  National  Shipyards and  Steel  Corporation  is  hereby ordered to deliver to  the said Jesus Aguirre such tank, but in the event that delivery is not possible,  to  pay to Aguirre the purchase price of P900, and  to  Leonora and  Co. the amount  of P11,299 which represents the costs of the  improvement made by the  said Leonora &amp;  Co. <br><br>"In the event that the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation shall deliver the oil tank to Jesus Aguirre as it is, the latter shall pay to Leonora and Co. the amount  of P11,299 which, as already stated was  spent by Leonora and Co. for the improvement of the tank." </blockquote>Aguirre filed a motion for reconsideration or for new trial in said  Case  No. 27988, which  motion  was denied.  He perfected  his appeal and according to  Annex  B  of  his petition for certiorari, the Clerk of  Court  forwarded  the amended record on  appeal to the Clerk of the Court of Appeals on April 17, 1957.  But  before that date, plaintiff Leonora &amp; Company in said Civil Case No.  27988 filed a motion  for execution of the  judgment,  which motion was opposed by Aguirre.  It would appear that the motion for execution was granted though-belatedly, because according to  Annex C of the petition  for  certiorari, the writ of execution was actually issued  on April 23,  1957 (Case No. 27988), which was  several days  after the record on appeal had been approved and supposedly been forwarded by the  Clerk of Court to the Court  of  Appeals.   On the basis of this issuance of the writ of execution,  Aguirre filed the present petition, claiming that when the writ of execution  was  issued,  the   appeal  had  already  been perfected  and  the record on appeal  had already been forwarded to the  Court of Appeals,  naturally, the lower court had already lost jurisdiction to issue  the writ of execution.<br><br>Under  Section 2  of  Rule   39  of the  Rules  of  Court, before the expiration of the time  to appeal, the trial court is vested with the discretion  to issue a  writ of execution pending appeal. However, once the record  on appeal has been  approved,  specially when said record has already been  forwarded to  the  appellate court, the  trial court no longer  has jurisdiction either  to issue a writ of execution or to dissolve a writ of  execution already  issued before the  perfection  of the appeal. (Syquia  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Concepcion and Palma, 60 Phil. 186; Uvero, et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Court of Appeals et al., 95 Phil., 11; LVM  Transportation Co. et al  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hon. Enrique Fernandez,  G. R.  No. L-9136, May 31, 1953).  It is therefore evident that the writ of execution issued on April 23, 1957, was issued without or in excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>In view  of the  foregoing,  the writ  of  certiorari  is hereby granted, the writ of execution  issued by  the trial court is hereby set  aside and the  writ of preliminary injunction heretofore  issued  is  made   permanent.   Respondent  Leonora  &amp;  Company will  pay the  costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,  Reyes,  A.,  Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
