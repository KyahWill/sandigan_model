				<H3>INTESTATE ESTATE OF THE SPOUSES ANGELA JOAQUIN AND JOAQUIN NAVARRO, DECEASED. <br>RAMON JOAQUIN, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. ANTONIO NAVARRO Y CASTRO, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This is an appeal by the oppositor from an order of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila appointing the petitioner as administrator of the intestate 
estate of the spouses Angela Joaquin and Joaquin Navarro</p>
<p>Counsel for the petitioner presented In evidence Exhibit "3", a certificate 
of the cleric of Court of First Instance of Manila containing entries appearing 
in the probate docket of said court to the effect that in 1910 Ramon Jose 
Joaquin y Patricio was decreed to be the adopted son of Joaquin Navarro and 
Angela Joaquin, and that his name was ordered changed to Ramon Jose Navarro y 
Joaquin. Counsel for the oppositor- appellant did not object to Exhibit "B", but 
it is now contended, under the first.assignment of error, that there is no proof 
tending to show that the 'petitioner is che same person mentioned in said 
exhibit, especially when the name used by him in the case at bar is Ramon 
Joaquin. This point has, however, been satisfactorily explained by petitioner's 
counsel who stated that after the adoption of the petitioner, the latter 
continued to use his old name "Ramon Joaquin" because the adopted name "Ramon 
Navarro" had often elicited jokes in view of its analogy to the name of a 
popular actor Ramon Navarro, and that, as a matter of fact, the petitioner 
filed a petition in the court of first Instance of Manila for a change of his 
name from Ramon Jose Navarro to Ramon Joaquin, the name used in the case at bar, 
which petition had already been granted.</p>
<p>The decisive argument of the oppositor-appellant is that advanced by his 
counsel in the third assignment of error, namely, that even assuming the 
existence of the decree of petitioner's adoption, the same is null and void, for 
the reason that the adoptive parents (Angela Joaquin and Joaquin Navarro) 
admittedly had a legitimate son in the person of the appellant. In this 
connection, the latter invokes Article 174 of the Civil Code prohibiting those 
having legitimate or legitimated descendants from adopting another. The question 
that here arises is whether, as contended by counsel for petitioner, the 
provisions of the Civil Code relating to adoption had been replaced and repealed 
by the corresponding provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure which do not 
contain the prohibition specified by Article 174 of the Civil code. This 
question, unluckily for the appellant, has heretofore been answered by this 
Court in the affirmative in the case of <em>In re</em>, adoption of Emiliano 
Guzman,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> decided June 30, 1941, 40 Off. 
Gaz., No. 10, p. 2083, in which the following pronouncement was made: 
"appellants argue, however, that the provisions of Article 178 of the Civil 
Code, which impliedly sanctions the adoption of a person of age, cannot be 
deemed repealed by the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. It will be 
noted that Chapter XII of the Code of Civil Procedure appears to be a complete 
enactment on the subject of adoption, and may thus be regarded as the expression 
of the whole law thereon. So viewed, that chapter must be deemed to have 
repealed the provisions of the Civil Code on the matter. While, as a general 
rule, implied repeal of a former statute by a later one is not favored, yet if 
the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly 
intended as a substitute it will operate similarly as a repeal of the earlier.' 
(Posadas vs. National City Bank of New York, 296 U.S., 497, 80 Law ed., 351.)" No sufficient reason has here been adduced justifying the reversal of this 
pronouncement .</p>
<p>Appellant in his memorandum further claims that even under the code of Civil 
Procedure petitioner's adoption is null and void, because section 766, which 
provides that "any inhabitant of the Philippine Islands being the husband of 
any woman who has a minor child by a former husband, may petition the Court of 
First Instance of she Province in which he resides for leave to adopt such minor 
child," evidently limits the right of the stepfather to adopt to a legitimate 
minor child; and that since the petitioner is admittedly a natural child of 
Angela Joaquin, his adoption by Joaquin Navarro is illegal. There can be no 
doubt that section 766 refers only to the adoption of a legitimate minor child 
but it does not operate as a prohibition for the adoption by a husband and wife 
jointly of the latter's illegitimate minor child which is clearly permissible 
under the general provision of section 765 providing that "an inhabitant of the 
Philippine Islands, not married, or a husband and wife jointly, may petition the Court of a First Instance of the province in which they reside for leave to 
adopt a minor child.," Moreover, that an illegitimate child may be adopted is 
clearly indicated by section 769 which generally ordains that "if the child to 
be adopted is illegitimate the consent of his father to the adoption shall not 
be required."</p>
<p>Having come to the conclusion that petitioner's adoption is valid under the 
Code of Civil Procedure, we do not need to discuss appellant's third assignment 
of error which refers to the right of the petitioner to present evidence tending 
to show relationship to Angela Joaquin other than his adoption; the fourth 
assignment of error which assails the ruling of the lower court to the effect 
that the validity of the decree of adoption cannot be impeached in the case at 
bar; and the fifth assignment under which the appellant maintains that the lower 
court erred in. appointing the petitioner as administrator, it appearing that 
opposition to petitioner's appointment is principally based on. the ground that 
the petitioner is not an adopted son of the deceased Angela Joaquin and Joaquin 
Navarro.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed order is hereby affirmed, with costs against the 
appellant. So ordered.</p><em>Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones, 
Padilla</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>
