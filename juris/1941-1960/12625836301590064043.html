				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition&nbsp; for review of a judgment&nbsp; rendered by the Court of Appeals reversing an order entered by the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; in&nbsp; special&nbsp; proceedings No. 18569 which allowed&nbsp; the claim of Rosita H. Porcuna&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P3,710&nbsp; and&nbsp; directed the guardian&nbsp; People's Bank&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Trust Co.&nbsp; to pay it out of&nbsp; the&nbsp; available funds of the wards.<br><br>The Court of Appeals found and held as follows:<br><blockquote>In this special proceedings, Rosita H. Porcuna filed a petition in which, for the reasons&nbsp; stated&nbsp; therein,&nbsp; she&nbsp; prays that&nbsp; she be authorized to collect&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P3,710 from the People's Bank and Trust Company, the&nbsp; guardian of the minors Elena and Dominador Coca.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges&nbsp; that from December 20, 1951 up to April 30, 1953, she gave to Visitaci6n Almonte Vda.&nbsp; de Coca, mother of the&nbsp; minors Elena&nbsp; and Dominador&nbsp; Coca,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the maintenance, support&nbsp; and&nbsp; education&nbsp; of said&nbsp; minors several&nbsp; sums&nbsp; of money amounting to P3,710; that she gave these various loans to Visitacion Almonte Vda. de Coca on the condition that they&nbsp; would be paid by the latter from the money due to the minors&nbsp; Elena&nbsp; and Dominador Coca&nbsp; from the U.S. Veterans&nbsp; Administration Office; and that the aforesaid minors&nbsp; have&nbsp; already&nbsp; received certain sums&nbsp; of money from&nbsp; the&nbsp; U.S.&nbsp; Veterans Administration,&nbsp; which&nbsp; money&nbsp; can&nbsp; be applied to the money borrowed by their mother for&nbsp; their&nbsp; maintenance, support and&nbsp; education.<br><br>The U.S. Veterans&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; opposed the&nbsp; petition on the ground (1) that Visitaci6n Vda. de Coca&nbsp; is personally liable for the payment of the claim of Rosita H.&nbsp; Porcuna; and (2) that even granting, without admitting, that Visitacion Almonte Vda. de Coca, mother of the aforementioned&nbsp; minors,&nbsp; obtained funds&nbsp; from Rosita H.&nbsp; Porcuna&nbsp; for&nbsp; the maintenance, support and education of said minors, these amounts of money obtained by her are&nbsp; not payable from the estate of the&nbsp; two minors for the reason that said Visitacion Almonte Vda. de Coca has no power&nbsp; to encumber&nbsp; the property of the wards.<br><br>We opine that the only question to be resolved in this appeal is whether the petitioner appellee Rosita H. Porcuna has the right to collect the amount of P3,710 from the estate of&nbsp; the minors Elena and&nbsp; Dominador&nbsp; Coca.<br><br>There is no dispute&nbsp; that the amounts of money&nbsp; stated in Exhibits A, A-l to A-19&nbsp; amounting to&nbsp; P3,710 were actually&nbsp; given by Rosita H. Porcuna to the mother of the minors Elena and Dominador Coca. According&nbsp; to the testimony of&nbsp; Visitacion Almonte Vda. de Coca she received said sums of money as loans for the&nbsp; expenses of her children Elena&nbsp; and Dominador Coca,&nbsp; who&nbsp; were studying&nbsp; at the Manila Northern College during&nbsp; the years 1951&nbsp; to 1953; that the monthly tuition fees of these&nbsp; two children&nbsp; were P10.00 and P5.00 respectively;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the. monthly&nbsp; expenses for their support, maintenance and education was P250.00 more or less monthly; and that she&nbsp; did not&nbsp; have any means of&nbsp; livelihood&nbsp; during&nbsp; the period from December 20, 1951 to&nbsp; April 30, 1953.<br><br>Oppositor-appellant&nbsp; U.S. Veterans Administration has established that&nbsp; Visitacion Vda. de Coca received from it&nbsp; during the period from December 12, 1951&nbsp; to November 10, 1952 the amount of $2,322.50 as indemnity for the&nbsp; insurance due to Valentin Coca, the deceased father of the minors&nbsp; Elena and Dominador&nbsp; Coca, another amount of P2.600.00 as gratuity pay due to said Visitacion Almonte Vda. de Coca; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; she&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; receiving a monthly pension of $92.90.<br><br>From the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Visitacion Almonte Vda.&nbsp; de Coca&nbsp; we deduced that/for&nbsp; the period of&nbsp; two years&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1951&nbsp; to 1953 she had spent P6,360 for the maintenance,&nbsp; support&nbsp; and education of her two children, the minors Elena and&nbsp; Dominador&nbsp; Coca.&nbsp; She received from the United States Veterans Administration the total sum&nbsp; of P7,245.&nbsp; This amount is&nbsp; even&nbsp; more&nbsp; than what&nbsp; she had actually spent for&nbsp; her&nbsp; two children&nbsp; during the above mentioned period.&nbsp; In addition to&nbsp; this&nbsp; amount, Visitacion Almonte&nbsp; Vda. de Coca had been receiving a monthly pension from the U.S. Veterans Administration.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is apparent that she had sufficient money in her possession to pay the loans she secured from Rosita H. Porcuna, even&nbsp; granting that&nbsp; these loans were for the maintenance, support and education of Elena and&nbsp; Dominador&nbsp; Coca.&nbsp; Consequently there is no&nbsp; reason now&nbsp; why the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; these two minors&nbsp; should answer for said loans.<br><br>Furthermore, legally speaking, said loans&nbsp; can not be paid from the estate of the minors, for the&nbsp; reason that the mother&nbsp; of the minors has no authority to encumber the minors, property in order to guarantee&nbsp; a loan she&nbsp; secured for the purpose of&nbsp; purchasing food, clothing and&nbsp; other necessities for said minors.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case at bar, Visitacion&nbsp; Almonte Vda. de Coca, the mother of the minors Elena and Dominador Coca, is only&nbsp; the natural guardian of the persons of said minors,&nbsp; while the&nbsp; People's&nbsp; Bank and Trust Company&nbsp; is the judicial&nbsp; guardian of&nbsp; said minors' properties.&nbsp; As such judicial guardian,&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; is the&nbsp; only&nbsp; one authorized&nbsp; to secure loans to be&nbsp; paid&nbsp; from the property&nbsp; of the&nbsp; ward.&nbsp; And&nbsp; even then, it needs, the court's approval, before it can validly contract such loans. (U.S.V.A. <i>vs.</i> Bustos, 48 Off. Gaz., 5240; Section 3, Rule 96, Rules of Court.)<br><br>In&nbsp; the light of the foregoing considerations, we&nbsp; declare that the estate of the minors Elena and&nbsp; Dominador&nbsp; Coca is&nbsp; not obliged to pay Rosita H. Porcuna's claim in&nbsp; the amount of P3,710. Premises&nbsp; Considered,&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is. hereby reversed.&nbsp; The petition of Rosita&nbsp; H. Porcuna is dismissed. Costs against appellee.<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; alleged that the&nbsp; sum of P3,710 received by the wards' mother&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; during the&nbsp; period from 20&nbsp; December 1951&nbsp; to&nbsp; 30&nbsp; April 1953 was&nbsp; disbursed for the maintenance,&nbsp; support and education of the minors; and&nbsp; that the said&nbsp; sum&nbsp; was lent by the petitioner&nbsp; to the wards' mother on condition that it would be paid&nbsp; by the latter out&nbsp; of the money&nbsp; due&nbsp; the wards from the United States&nbsp; Veterans&nbsp; Administration.&nbsp; It&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; the ward's mother had received&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States Veterans Administration from&nbsp; 12&nbsp; December&nbsp; 1951 to&nbsp; 10 November 1952 the sum of $2,322.50 or P4,645 as insurance indemnity and&nbsp; P2,600 as gratuity pay due to the estate of Valentin&nbsp; Coca,&nbsp; her&nbsp; deceased husband&nbsp; and&nbsp; father&nbsp; of the minors, or a total&nbsp; of&nbsp; P7,245,&nbsp; in&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to a monthly pension of $92.90 or P185.80; that the guardianship proceedings in this case was&nbsp; begun on 15&nbsp; January&nbsp; 1953; and that only in May 1953 did the wards begin to receive&nbsp; from the United&nbsp; States Veterans Administration&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P30 each for monthly allowance and P50 each for immediate necessities (Annex B to petition).&nbsp; From 20 December 1951&nbsp; to 30&nbsp; April 1953,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the wards'&nbsp; mother borrowed&nbsp; the money from the petitioner,&nbsp; she&nbsp; was&nbsp; in a position to give support to her&nbsp; minor children who had not yet&nbsp; received any&nbsp; benefit&nbsp; from&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States Veterans&nbsp; Administration&nbsp; and were not&nbsp; in a position to support themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following provisions of the Civil Code&nbsp; on support&nbsp; provide;<br><blockquote>ART.&nbsp; 290. Support is everything that is indispensable for sustenance, dwelling, clothing and medical attendance,&nbsp; according to the social&nbsp; position of the&nbsp; family.<br><br>Support also includes the education of the person entitled to be supported&nbsp; until he completes his education&nbsp; or&nbsp; training for some profession,&nbsp; trade or vocation, even&nbsp; beyond the&nbsp; age of majority.<br><br>Art.&nbsp; 291. The&nbsp; following are obliged to support each other to the whole extent set forth in&nbsp; the&nbsp; preceding article:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; The&nbsp; spouses;<br>(2)&nbsp; Legitimate&nbsp; ascendants and descendants;<br><br><center>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *<br></center><br>ART.&nbsp; 294. The&nbsp; claim for&nbsp; support, when proper and two&nbsp; or more persons are obliged to give it, shall be made in the following order:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; From the&nbsp; spouse;<br>(2)&nbsp; From the descendants of the nearest degree;<br>(3)&nbsp; From the&nbsp; ascendants, also of the nearest degree;<br></blockquote>Granting that the sum of money&nbsp; lent&nbsp; by the petitioner was spent&nbsp; for the&nbsp; maintenance,&nbsp; support&nbsp; and education of the wards, still their funds due from the United States Veterans Administration cannot legally be made answerable for 'the loan secured&nbsp; by their&nbsp; mother,&nbsp; because the latter was in duty bound to give them support at a&nbsp; time when they did not have the means to support themselves and she was in&nbsp; a position&nbsp; to do so.<br><br>Appellant contends that pursuant to articles 320 and 326 of the&nbsp; Civil Code, the mother is the administratrix and guardian&nbsp; of the&nbsp; child's properties; that the incurring of debts for the purchase of necessaries and&nbsp; for&nbsp; the maintenance, support and education of the child is a&nbsp; pure act of administration which may be exercised without previous authority of the&nbsp; court;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that pursuant to&nbsp; section 2, Rule&nbsp; 97,&nbsp; such debts&nbsp; must be&nbsp; paid out&nbsp; of the ward's personal estate and the income of his real&nbsp; estate.<br><br>Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 390,&nbsp; approved on 18&nbsp; June 1949, governs the guardianship of incompetent veterans, other incompetents and minor beneficiaries&nbsp; of the United States Veterans&nbsp; Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being&nbsp; a&nbsp; special&nbsp; law&nbsp; limited in operation to money benefits received from the United States&nbsp; Veterans&nbsp;&nbsp; Administration,&nbsp; it&nbsp; prevails&nbsp; over&nbsp;&nbsp; the provisions of the&nbsp; Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Section 17 of the said Act provides:<br><blockquote>A guardian must manage the estate of his ward frugally and without&nbsp; waste, and&nbsp; shall not&nbsp; apply any&nbsp; portion of&nbsp; the income or the estate for the support or maintenance of any person other than the ward, the spouse&nbsp; and the&nbsp; minor children of the ward, except upon&nbsp; petition to&nbsp; and prior order&nbsp; of the Court after a hearing.&nbsp; A signed&nbsp; duplicate or certified copy of said petition shall be furnished&nbsp; the Chief Attorney of&nbsp; the Veterans Administration and notice&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; given the Chief Attorney as provided in the case of hearing on a guardian's account or other pleading.<br></blockquote>Section 18 of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Act provides:<br><blockquote>Guardians appointed&nbsp; under&nbsp; this Act, at their discretion, and with written approval of&nbsp; the Chief Attorney of the Veterans Administration, may make expenditures of guardianship funds for the benefit of their wards, without court approval: Provided, however, That no single expenditure shall exceed the sum of twenty pesos, and&nbsp; the aggregate of all&nbsp; such&nbsp; expenditures in any twelve months period shall not&nbsp; exceed four hundred pesos&nbsp; for any ward.<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; United States&nbsp; Veterans Administration <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Bustos, 48 Off. Gaz., 5240-5242, this Court held:<br><blockquote>Assuming, <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span>,&nbsp; that the mother&nbsp; and her natural children secured loans from claimant-appellant&nbsp; with which&nbsp; to purchase the food, clothing, and necessaries&nbsp; of&nbsp; her&nbsp; minor wards&nbsp; or&nbsp; to provide them with&nbsp; education,&nbsp; she certainly has no&nbsp; power&nbsp; nor authority to encumber&nbsp; the property of the wards to&nbsp; guaranty the loan thus secured, or&nbsp; to bind for the payment of the loan the pensions that the minors&nbsp; may be entitled to&nbsp; receive&nbsp; thereafter.&nbsp; Only&nbsp; a judicial guardian of the&nbsp; ward's property may validly do so, and&nbsp; even then only&nbsp; with&nbsp; the court's&nbsp; prior approval&nbsp; secured in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Rule 96, Rules of Court.) The&nbsp; execution of the "Deed of&nbsp; Loan" in the case at bar is, therefore, clearly beyond the scope of a natural guardian's power or authority.<br></blockquote>Moreover, section 1, Republic Act No. 360, approved on 9&nbsp; June 1949 provides:<br><blockquote>Payments of benefits due or to become due to any person residing in the Philippines under the laws of the United States administered by the United States Veterans Administration shall not be assignable,&nbsp; and&nbsp; such payments made to, or&nbsp; on account of, a beneficiary under any of the&nbsp; laws of the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; administered by the United States Veterans Administration&nbsp; relating to veterans residing in the Philippines&nbsp; shall be exempt from&nbsp; taxation as well as from claims of creditors, and&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not be liable&nbsp; to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatsoever, either before or after receipt-by&nbsp; the&nbsp; beneficiary.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *.<br></blockquote>The judgment under review&nbsp; is affirmed,&nbsp; without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
