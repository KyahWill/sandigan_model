				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a long drawn out litigation that has lasted many years; in its first phase,&nbsp; it has&nbsp; involved a&nbsp; long decision by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals and an&nbsp; eight-page&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of this Tribunal;&nbsp; and in&nbsp; its second&nbsp; phase, an&nbsp; eleven-page decision of the same Court of Appeals and a resolution of this Tribunal dismissing a petition for certiorari to review said last decision&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The third phase of the litigation is the present petition for mandamus to compel the lower court to approve the record on appeal filed by petitioners, wherein they tried to appeal the order of&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of the trial court&nbsp; to implement the&nbsp; last decision of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>For a clear and comprehensive statement of the first part of the history of this case, as well as the issues involved therein&nbsp; and the determination thereof, we&nbsp; can&nbsp; do no better than reproduce&nbsp; a pertinent portion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; well written second&nbsp; decision of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals,&nbsp; penned by Justice Felipe Natividad,&nbsp; based&nbsp; in part&nbsp; on our aforementioned decision&nbsp; in&nbsp; the first phase of the litigation:<br><blockquote>"This case is once more before this Court on the appeal taken by the plaintiffs from an order of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila fixing the value of the two&nbsp; buildings involved therein&nbsp; at P50,000 and providing that the plaintiffs&nbsp; should&nbsp; pay&nbsp; that&nbsp; amount to&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; if they desire&nbsp; to&nbsp; appropriate&nbsp; said buildings.<br><br>"The&nbsp; records&nbsp; disclose that prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; the year&nbsp; 1930&nbsp; defendant Joaquin C.&nbsp; Yuseco,&nbsp; an&nbsp; attorney-at-law, had been rendering without compensation&nbsp; professional services to Maria&nbsp; Lim.&nbsp; To&nbsp; show&nbsp; her appreciation of such services,&nbsp; Maria Lim offered&nbsp; to&nbsp; Joaquin C. Yuseco and his wife, defendant&nbsp; Rosario Yuseco, for them to build a&nbsp; house thereon, Lots 11-A and&nbsp; 11-B, Block 2251, of the Hacienda de San Lazaro, registered in her&nbsp; name under&nbsp; Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 36400 and 36401,&nbsp; Office of&nbsp; the Register of Deeds of the City&nbsp; of Manila. The Yusecos accepted the offer,&nbsp; and in the middle&nbsp; part of that year they built a dwelling&nbsp; house and an annex for garage and servant&nbsp; quarters on said&nbsp; lots.&nbsp; To legalize&nbsp; the possession of said lots by the Yusecos, Maria Lim and the Yusecos executed&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract of lease covering them, which&nbsp; was to run&nbsp; for a&nbsp; period of five years,&nbsp; with a yearly rental of&nbsp; P120.<br><br>"On&nbsp; November&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1945,&nbsp; a few days&nbsp; before her death,&nbsp; Maria Lim sold the&nbsp; two lots&nbsp; above referred to to her daughter, plaintiff Belen&nbsp; Uy Tayag,&nbsp; married to&nbsp; Jesus B.&nbsp; Tayag, for&nbsp; the sum of P4,000.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the year 1946,&nbsp; the Tayags asked the Yusecos to remove their&nbsp; house from the lots, or else&nbsp; pay to them a monthly rent of P120 therefor.&nbsp; The latter&nbsp; refused.&nbsp; Because of this&nbsp; attitude of&nbsp; the Yusecos, the Tayags brought against the latter in the Municipal Court of the city of Manila an action of ejection for the restitution of the lots&nbsp; to them and the recovery of a monthly&nbsp; rental of P500 from November 30, 1945, up to the date of the restitution.&nbsp; Judgment was rendered in that court in favor&nbsp; of the plaintiffs.&nbsp; The defendants appealed.<br><br>"The case was duly&nbsp; tried in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; After such trial, that court rendered judgment adjudicating to&nbsp; the plaintiff Belen Uy Tayag the possession&nbsp; of the two lots involved in the action, with right to appropriate the two&nbsp; building is existing thereon&nbsp; upon&nbsp; payment&nbsp; to the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; of their value, which&nbsp; it assessed at the sum of&nbsp; P50,000, and providing that should the plaintiffs&nbsp; fail to pay this&nbsp; amount within&nbsp; 90&nbsp; days after&nbsp; the decision shall have become&nbsp; final, the defendants&nbsp; shall have the&nbsp; right to&nbsp; purchase said lots for the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P10,000&nbsp; to&nbsp; be paid within 90 days from the date the plaintiffs&nbsp; shall have failed&nbsp; to buy&nbsp; the buildings.&nbsp; From this judgment,&nbsp; the plaintiffs appealed.<br><br>"The Court of Appeals, finding that the defendants were possessors of the lots in good faith, affirmed the judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not satisfied with this judgment, the plaintiffs appealed&nbsp; therefrom&nbsp; by&nbsp; certiorari to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter, after due hearing, rendered judgment,&nbsp; the dispositive&nbsp; part of which&nbsp; reads&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><br>"Affirming the decision of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals in&nbsp; so&nbsp; far as&nbsp; it finds&nbsp; and declares&nbsp; respondents to&nbsp; be&nbsp; possessors in&nbsp; good&nbsp; faith, let this case be remanded to&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court for further&nbsp; proceedings,&nbsp; particularly to&nbsp; give an&nbsp; opportunity to plaintiffs-petitioners to&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; their&nbsp; choice&nbsp; and&nbsp; option;&nbsp; and for&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; said choice and&nbsp; option&nbsp; the trial court&nbsp; will&nbsp; admit evidence&nbsp; and make a&nbsp; finding as to the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the useful expenditures&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; "the increase in&nbsp; value which the thing&nbsp; has acquired by reason thereof", under Art.&nbsp; 453&nbsp; of the&nbsp; old&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code, to be&nbsp; refunded&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; paid by&nbsp; the petitioners should they choose to appropriate the buildings; "the&nbsp; value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land" under Art. 361&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; to be&nbsp; paid by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants-respondents in case plaintiffs-petitioner? elect&nbsp; to compel&nbsp; them&nbsp; to&nbsp; buy the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs."<br><br>"Upon&nbsp; the case being&nbsp; remanded to the Court&nbsp; of First Instance, of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; the latter,&nbsp; in consonance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Directive&nbsp; of the Supreme&nbsp; Court, issued&nbsp; on July 11,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; an&nbsp; order requiring the plaintiffs to make&nbsp; their&nbsp; choice in&nbsp; writing within 10 days whether they&nbsp; would&nbsp; purchase the buildings erected on the lots,&nbsp; or&nbsp; allow the defendants to buy said lots, and set the case for&nbsp; hearing on August 3, 1956, for the reception of the evidence of the parties regarding the value of said&nbsp; lots and&nbsp; buildings.&nbsp; Complying with this order, on&nbsp; July 20, 1956, the plaintiffs, through counsel, filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; manifestation&nbsp; stating that<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"they&nbsp; are not willing&nbsp; to sell the&nbsp; lot involved in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, but that they are willing to appropriate the building erected thereon if&nbsp; its valuation&nbsp; is&nbsp; as it should be and is&nbsp; properly and fairly determined pursuant to, and&nbsp; in accordance with the&nbsp; evidence and the&nbsp; law."<br></div><br>On August&nbsp; 3, 1956, when the case was&nbsp; called for hearing, the&nbsp; trial court, in&nbsp; open court,&nbsp; issued the following order:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">'Considering&nbsp; that&nbsp; choice&nbsp; made by&nbsp; the plaintiffs, the&nbsp; Court is of the opinion that the next step now is to adduce&nbsp; evidence in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with the value of the buildings erected on the&nbsp; land pursuant to the&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the decision of&nbsp; the Supreme Court.&nbsp; And the&nbsp; Court believes that under the circumstances since the&nbsp; defendants will be the&nbsp; sellers,&nbsp; they have&nbsp; the burden&nbsp; of proving the value&nbsp; of the buildings&nbsp; which&nbsp; belong to&nbsp; them, giving the plaintiffs&nbsp; opportunity to offer their own&nbsp; evidence as rebuttal. That is the ruling of the Court.'<br></div><br>The plaintiffs&nbsp; asked for a&nbsp; reconsideration of this order, and&nbsp; for the issuance of another allowing them&nbsp; to&nbsp; adduce evidence on&nbsp; the value of the buildings as well as the lots.&nbsp;&nbsp; This motion was denied.<br><br>"The case was&nbsp; finally heard&nbsp; in, the Court of First Instance of Manila on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 23&nbsp; and&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence was&nbsp; presented in said hearings by&nbsp; the plaintiffs&nbsp; and the defendants.&nbsp; The evidence of the plaintiffs tends to show that the value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; two buildings erected on the lots in question cannot&nbsp; be more than P40,000.&nbsp; That of the&nbsp; defendants,&nbsp; on the other&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; establishes that the value of the chalet erected on the lots was&nbsp; from P45,000 to P50.000,&nbsp; and of the garage and dwelling house, from P5.000&nbsp; to P6,000.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the evidence thus submitted, the trial court, in its order of August&nbsp; 28, 1956, fixed the reasonable value&nbsp; of the two buildings on the lots at P50,000, and ordered that&nbsp; that&nbsp; amount&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; paid&nbsp; by&nbsp; the plaintiffs to the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; if they&nbsp; desire&nbsp; to&nbsp; appropriate said buildings.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp; order&nbsp; appealed from.<br><br>"Appellants concede that the fact that the appellees were possessors in good faith of the lots in&nbsp; question is <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> between&nbsp; the parties.&nbsp; They contend,&nbsp; however, <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>,&nbsp; that the trial court erred in limiting the&nbsp; reception of the evidence&nbsp; to the value of the buildings erected&nbsp; on the lots in&nbsp; question, instead of admitting evidence&nbsp; on the value of both&nbsp; said lots and buildings; and, second,&nbsp; that the trial court erred in assessing at&nbsp; P50,000&nbsp; the&nbsp; value of the&nbsp; two buildings on said&nbsp; lots.<br><br>"1.&nbsp; Appellants contend under the first proposition that the decision of the Supreme Court of October 24, 1955, affirming the finding of the Court of Appeals that the appellees&nbsp; were possessors of the lots in question in good faith and&nbsp; ordering the remand of the case to the court of origin,&nbsp; contemplates the reception of evidence&nbsp;&nbsp; as to the values of&nbsp; both said lots' and the buildings&nbsp; existing thereon irrespective of the choice and option&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; may exercise in the premises, and,&nbsp; consequently, the trial court, in limiting&nbsp; the reception of&nbsp; evidence on the value of&nbsp; the buildings, failed to fully implement the&nbsp; instructions of the Supreme Court.<br><br>"We do not&nbsp; share appellants'&nbsp; view.&nbsp; The pertinent part of&nbsp; the decision of the Supreme&nbsp; Court of October 24, 1955, reads as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">" '* * * and&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; purposes&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; choice&nbsp; and&nbsp; option&nbsp;&nbsp; the trial court will admit evidence and make a&nbsp; finding as to the amount of&nbsp; the useful expenditures&nbsp; or&nbsp; "the&nbsp; increase in&nbsp; value&nbsp; which the thing has&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; by reason . thereof",&nbsp; under Art. 453: of&nbsp; the old&nbsp; Civil Code, to be&nbsp; refunded or paid by the petitioners should they choose to appropriate the&nbsp; buildings;&nbsp; "the value of the land" under&nbsp; Art. 361&nbsp; of the same Code, to be paid by the defendants-respondents in&nbsp; case plaintiffs-petitioners&nbsp; elect to compel them to buy the land.'<br></div><br>"It will be noted that the directive made in the above decision is in&nbsp; alternative. The clause having reference to the admission of evidence regarding&nbsp; the value&nbsp; of the buildings is separated&nbsp; by a semi-colon from the clause&nbsp; referring to the value&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lots on which said buildings are erected; and the first clause ends with tho phrase 'to be refunded or paid to the petitioners should they choose to appropriate&nbsp; the&nbsp; buildings', while the second clause&nbsp; terminates with&nbsp; the phrase 'to be paid by the defendants respondents&nbsp; in&nbsp; case plaintiffs-petitioners&nbsp; elect&nbsp; to compel&nbsp; them&nbsp; to&nbsp; buy&nbsp; the&nbsp; land.' It would seem clear, therefore,&nbsp; from the language of the decision&nbsp; that evidence as to the value of&nbsp; said buildings should&nbsp; be admitted' only if the appellants choose to appropriate&nbsp; the buildings, and that, in case the appellants&nbsp; should elect to compel the&nbsp; appellees to buy the lots,&nbsp; then&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; concerning&nbsp; the value&nbsp; of said&nbsp; lots must be admitted. This, in&nbsp; our opinion, is the most sensible construction that could be given to the decision above referred&nbsp; to.&nbsp; Any other construction would bring about unnecessary confusion&nbsp; in the evidence, to say nothing of the valuable time&nbsp; of the Court that&nbsp; will necessarily be wasted. For, it stands&nbsp; to&nbsp; reason, that&nbsp; if the appellants chose not to&nbsp; sell the lots&nbsp; to&nbsp; the appellees and&nbsp; to&nbsp; appropriate&nbsp; the buildings, which cannot be&nbsp; ordered removed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; builders, the thing in order would be the reception of evidence having reference to the value of&nbsp; said buildings&nbsp; only.&nbsp; Evidence as to&nbsp; the value of the lots&nbsp; would&nbsp; be superfluous, impertinent&nbsp; and immaterial.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was what the trial court did.&nbsp; We, therefore, find&nbsp; the action of the trial court complained&nbsp; of in accordance with law." * * *<br></blockquote>Under&nbsp; the second&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Appeals,&nbsp; the value of the two buildings in&nbsp; question fixed by&nbsp; the trial court at P50,000 was reduced to P47,500.&nbsp;&nbsp; With that modification, the decision of the trial court was affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; As already stated, petitioners herein filed with us a petition for&nbsp; certiorari to&nbsp; review said decision&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals, but we dismissed said petition for lack of merit. In other words, we found said decision to be correct.<br><br>When said&nbsp; decision&nbsp; finally reached&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court, the latter issued&nbsp; the corresponding writ of&nbsp; execution to collect&nbsp; from petitioners the sum of P47,500 for the&nbsp; buildings&nbsp; in litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners protested the&nbsp; writ of execution,&nbsp; claiming&nbsp; that&nbsp; it varied the&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of the&nbsp; final decision, and&nbsp; upon denial of their petition for reconsideration, tried to appeal therefrom by preparing the corresponding record&nbsp; on appeal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court refused to approve the record on&nbsp; appeal, saying that the order for the writ of execution issued by it was fully in accordance with the&nbsp; terms of the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the present petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; mandamus&nbsp; to&nbsp; compel the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; to elevate the case to us on appeal.<br><br>We are satisfied that the trial court' acted correctly in ordering&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ of execution&nbsp; to issue.&nbsp; The&nbsp; main contention of herein petitioners is&nbsp; that they still&nbsp; retain the right of option, that is to say, to make a choice of either buying the house or compelling&nbsp; the&nbsp; owners thereof to buy the land; and that&nbsp; furthermore, even if they already had made that choice, nevertheless, they cannot be compelled to pay the price fixed by the courts for the purchase of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said houses, because of their inability to&nbsp; pay the said&nbsp; price.&nbsp; We&nbsp; find&nbsp; both&nbsp; arguments&nbsp;&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; The question of whether petitioners had&nbsp; finally&nbsp; made their choice,&nbsp; namely, to buy the houses because they were&nbsp; unwilling to sell the land, was directly in issue before the Court of Appeals which definitely decided that petitioners had made their choice not to sell their&nbsp; land but to buy the houses built thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have&nbsp; already said, by our refusal to review said decision of the Court of Appeals, we agreed with the said court on its stand on this point; consequently, the trial court was fully warranted in limiting the presentation&nbsp; of evidence to the value of the said houses, not of the land.<br><br>As&nbsp; regards the alleged inability of petitioners to pay the value&nbsp; of the buildings finally fixed by the courts at P47,500, claimed by them to be a good reason for not compelling them to buy the buildings,&nbsp; we cannot sanction&nbsp; said theory. Otherwise, were that claim or contention to be sustained, and if&nbsp; petitioners were allowed to change their mind, repudiate&nbsp; their choice made in court not to sell the land but to buy the buildings, and then&nbsp; compel the owners of the houses, respondents herein, instead to buy land, then what if respondents also claimed&nbsp; inability to pay the price of the land, claiming that it is also a good and valid reason for not&nbsp; compelling them&nbsp; to make the&nbsp; purchase?&nbsp; How would this litigation end, if it ever would end?<br><br>We hold that once a party, in conformity with a court decision,&nbsp; has&nbsp; made his choice, and has duly&nbsp; informed the court of said&nbsp; choice,&nbsp; and&nbsp; is accordingly&nbsp; ordered to comply&nbsp; with the&nbsp; same by&nbsp; buying the&nbsp; building erected on&nbsp; his land and pay the value thereof fixed by the courts, that duty is converted into a money obligation which can be&nbsp; enforced by execution,&nbsp; regardless of the unwillingness and alleged inability of the party concerned to&nbsp; pay the amount.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here there is a final decision of the petitioners to buy the houses and pay the value thereof.&nbsp; If petitioners were ready, willing and able to pay the amount, there would be&nbsp; no need for execution.&nbsp; It is precisely because they are unwilling and allegedly unready and unable to pay the sum, that&nbsp; execution issues.&nbsp; That is part of&nbsp; the judicial&nbsp; machinery&nbsp; of due process in&nbsp; action,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we find nothing wrong in it.<br><br>As to the alleged absence in the order of execution for the houseowners to make the transfer of&nbsp; the houses to the petitioners, that is to be understood, that upon&nbsp; full payment of the price of the&nbsp; houses, the respondents herein will make and&nbsp; execute the corresponding deed of transfer.<br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; foregoing, the petition for mandamus is&nbsp; hereby denied,&nbsp; with costs.&nbsp; The&nbsp; writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is hereby ordered dissolved.<br><br><i>Paras, C, J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
