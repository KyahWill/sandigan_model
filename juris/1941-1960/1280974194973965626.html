				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On May 21, 1949, the plaintiffs filed in the Court of First 
Instance of Samar a complaint against the defendant, Claudia Latorre, to
 compel the latter to recognize the plaintiffs as the natural daughters 
of Vicente Latorre, deceased brother of the defendant, and to secure a 
partition of the properties left by Vicente Latorre.  In the answer 
filed by the defendant, it is alleged, as an affirmative defense, that 
plaintiffs' causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations.  
With respect to this defense, the parties submitted the following 
agreement of facts:
  <blockquote>
    <p>"1.  That the plaintiffs are not duly recognized daughters of 
Vicente Latorre as provided in Art. 131 of the Civil Code;</p>
    <p> "2.  That the plaintiffs are not judicially recognized daughters
 of Vicente Latorre as provided in Arts. 135 and 137 of the Civil Code;</p>
    <p> "3.  That the plaintiffs have been in the uninterrupted 
possession of the status of natural children of the deceased Vicente 
Latorre, brother of the defendant;</p>
    <p> "4.  That Vicente Latorre died in the year 1933; </p>
    <p>"5.  That the plaintiff Victorina Gabrinao became of age during 
the lifetime of Vicente Latorre, and the other plaintiff Trinidad 
Gabrinao became of age in the year 1934; and</p>
    <p> "6.  That this action was brought for the first time in the year
 1949."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    In its order dated December 28, 1949, the Court of First 
Instance of Samar dismissed the complaint with costs against the 
plaintiffs, thereby sustaining the defendant's contention that 
plaintiffs' action for recognition as natural children had prescribed.  
The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>
  <p>    The applicable legal provision is Article 137 of the Civil Code
 which provides as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Actions for the acknowledgment of natural children may be 
commenced only during the lifetime of the putative parents except in the
 following cases â€”</p>
    <p>"1.  If the father or mother died during the minority of the 
child, in which case the latter may commence the action within the four 
years next following the attainment of its majority.</p>
    <p>"2.  If, after the death of the father or mother, some document, 
before unknown, should be discovered in which the child is expressly 
acknowledged.</p>
    <p>"In this case the action must be commenced within six months next
 following the discovery of such document."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    An action to compel acknowledgment is thus to be brought within
 the lifetime of the supposed parents, unless the case comes within one 
of the two exceptions.  (Capistrano <i>vs.</i> Gabino, 8 Phil. 135; 
Serrano <i>vs.</i> Aragon, 22 Phil. 10.)  It being stipulated that the 
plaintiff, Victorina Gabrinao became of age during the lifetime of her 
natural father, Vicente Latorre, the action brought after the latter's 
death cannot as to her prosper.  It being admitted that Vicente Latorre 
died in the year 1933, and the plaintiff Trinidad Gabrinao became of age
 in the year 1934, it also follows that as to her prescription had set 
in, because under the first exception, in relation to section 45 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, the action for recognition must be brought 
within two years after majority.  (Suarez <i>vs.</i> Suarez, 43 Phil. 
903.)  The second exception cannot be invoked by the plaintiffs, since 
it is neither pretended nor proved that, after the death of Vicente 
Latorre, some unknown document was discovered in which they are 
expressly acknowledged.</p>
  <p>    The plaintiffs-appellants, however, argue that the defense of 
prescription had been waived by the defendant-appellee by reason of the 
alleged fact that the latter, in recognition of their right to inherit 
from their natural father, continuously gave them their share in the 
products of the land and in the rentals for the use of the carabaos in 
question until November 1948 when the defendant for the first time 
desisted.  Even assuming that the defense of prescription may be waived 
in this particular case, the contention is manifestly without basis, 
since there is nothing in the stipulation and there is no proof in the 
record to support plaintiffs' factual allegation.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the appealed order is affirmed without costs in both
 instances.  So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
