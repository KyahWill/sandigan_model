				<H3>RITA GARCHITORENA VDA. DE CENTENERA, APPLICANT AND APPELLEE; MARIANO GARCHITORENA, MOVANT AND APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE SOTTO, H. P. OBIAS AND ANA PATAAN, OPPOSITORS AND APPELLANTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On June 20, 1940, Mariano Garchitorena filed a motion praying that 
subdivision plan Psu-66063-Amd., marked as Annex E, be approved and that it be 
decreed that certificates of title be issued in his name on lots 2, 3, and 4 of 
the original plan Psu-66063 and upon lots 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the subdivision 
plan Psu-66063-Amd.
<p>The movant alleged that on May 14, 1931, a decision was rendered by the lower 
court granting Rita Garchitorena as heiress of her father Andres, title over 
four lots, the same described in her original application, subject to lien in 
favor of Mariano Garchitorena and other creditors, with the exclusion of about 
500 hectares belonging to Ramon and Jose Alvarez, about 300 hectares of land of 
the public domain, a portion of 18 hectares belonging to Hermogenes P. Obias and 
another portion of 24 hectares of land of the public domain, with the exception 
of 4 hectares belonging to Januario Alvarez, all said portions being included in 
lot number 1. It is also alleged that after said judgment was modified by the 
Supreme Court and some steps have been taken as a result of said modification, 
lots 1, 2, 3, and 4 of land Psu-66063 were adjudicated to Mariano Garchitorena 
in consideration of the amount of P28,745.93, a deed of sale having been 
executed to said effect on September 8, 1935, which was approved by the lower 
court on April 26, 1940, and that Mariano Garchitorena bought the 500 hectares 
of Ramon and Jose Alvarez on April 27, 1939.</p>
<p>Several persons appeared to oppose the motion, but only three of them came to 
us appealing against the lower court's order dated June 28, 1941, decreeing the 
issuance of certificate of titles in favor of Mariano Garchitorena on lots 2, 3, 
and 4 of the original plan Psu-66063, and on lots 6 and 8 of the subdivision 
plan Psu-66063-Amd., and on lots 1, 6, and 7 of the same subdivision plan.</p>
<p>The appellants are H. P. Obias, Ana Pataan and Vicente Sotto.</p>
<p>We will deal separately with their respective contentions.</p>
<p align="center">OPPOSITION OF H. P. OBIAS</p>
<p>This oppositor contends that the 300 hectares ordered to be excluded from lot 
number 1 as land of public domain, as provided in the lower court's decision of 
May 14, 1931, in fact should measure not only 300 hectares but 961 hectares, 38 
ares and 9 centares.</p>
<p>The lower court disposed of the opposition by stating that the decision of 
May 14, 1931, was amended, and the Supreme Court affirmed it as amended, and 
that the subdivision plan Psu-66063-Amd. is in conformity with the terms of said 
amended decision.</p>
<p>Appellant Obias complains in his appeal that the lower court erred in 
awarding to Mariano Garchitorena the title on lots 1, 6, and 7 of subdivision 
plan Psu-66063-Amd., belonging originally to Ramon and Jose Alvarez.</p>
<p>No law and no authority has been invoked in support of appellant's 
contention, although he advances several reasons in support of his theory. The 
reasons advanced are stated in his brief as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Ramon Alvarez did not seek any affirmative relief in his opposition to 
the application for registration of Rita Garchitorena so that what the Court did 
in rendering its decision was simply to order its segregation from the plan, and 
hence his supposed successor in interest, Mariano Garchitorena, could not be 
entitled to the issuance of a degree of registration in the name of the 
latter.</p>
<p>"2. Because the decision rendered in this case is already final, and hence 
cannot be amended.</p>
<p>"3. Because the duty of the lower Court in regards to this case is simply to 
comply with that final judgment so that inasmuch as the dispositive part orders 
the segregation from the plan of the portions awarded to Roman Alvarez, the 
lower Court is in duty bound to comply with that mandatory order.</p>
<p>"4. Because the issuance of a decree of registration in favor of the 
movant-appellant for the portions awarded to Ramon Alvarez and Jose Alvarez 
would create an anomaly, in the sense that interested parties would be 
prejudiced thereby. There are several persons possessing portions of land within 
the land adjudicated to Ramon Alvarez and Jose Alvarez. They possessed these 
portions with a claim of right of ownership adverse to that of Ramon Alvarez and 
Jose Alvarez."</p></blockquote>
<p>We do not find merit in appellant's contention.</p>
<p>Section 38 of the Land Registration Act No. 496, as amended by Act No. 3621, 
which took effect on December 5, 1929, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If the court after hearing finds that the applicant or adverse claimant has 
title as stated in his application or adverse claim and proper for registration, 
a decree of confirmation and registration shall be entered * * 
*."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Garchitorena Vda. de Centenera <i>vs</i>. Obias (58 Phil., 21, 
23), the Supreme Court declared that from the evidence "it conclusively appears 
that the late Jose Alvarez and his successors had a considerable extent of land 
in the same place where the applicant's land is situated, and taking also into 
account that the land was surveyed for purposes of registration, we find that 
the weight of the evidence indicates that the land claimed by the opponent Ramon 
Alvarez had been included in the applicant's plan. This land has an area of 500 
hectares. According to Ramon Alvarez, it appears that his father, Ibo Alvarez, 
had held the tract since 1905 and that at the death of said Ibo Alvarez, Ramon 
Alvarez and his co-owner, Jose Alvarez, entered into possession and have 
remained therein since."</p>
<p>From the above, there cannot be any doubt that Ramon and Jose Alvarez have 
been finally declared as the owners of the 500 hectares in question, and such 
declaration is good for all purposes, including the issuance of the 
corresponding certificates of title to said owners or their successors in 
interest, such as buyer Mariano Garchitorena. Appellant's allegation that the 
decree of registration in favor of Mariano Garchitorena for the portions awarded 
to Ramon and Jose Alvarez would prejudice interested parties is groundless, 
because all interested parties were given full opportunity to advance and 
present their respective claims since the original application was duly 
published and the proceedings for registration, which are <i>in rem</i> in 
character, were begun, it appearing that the original application included the 
500 hectares which were finally adjudicated to Ramon and Jose Alvarez. Anybody 
and everybody who had any legitimate claim to said 500 hectares or any part 
thereof, if they wanted to, could have appeared before the court and presented 
their claims. If they failed to do it at the opportune time, it is now too late 
for them to complain.</p>
<p align="center">APPEAL OF ANA PATAAN</p>
<p>This appellant complains that the lower court erred in holding that the free 
patent title number 1406 of said Ana Pataan is null and void <i>ab 
initio</i>.</p>
<p>The lower court's action is based upon the fact that when the free patent 
title number 1406 was issued in 1937, the land of 10 hectares covered by it was 
part of a larger tract which was declared private property according to the 
decision of May 14, 1931, which was later affirmed by the Supreme Court, very 
much earlier than the issuance of the free patent title in question.</p>
<p>We do not find any error in the lower court's action.</p>
<p>The decision of the Supreme Court declaring the land in question as private 
property was promulgated on March 4, 1933 (Garchitorena Vda. de Centenera 
<i>vs</i>. Obias, 58 Phil., 21), that is more than four years before the 
issuance of the free patent title in question on March 21, 1937.</p>
<p>Upon this conclusion, it will serve no purpose to pass upon the question 
raised by appellant Pataan as to the court's denial of her motion for reopening, 
besides the fact that the basis of her contention, that she has not been 
mentioned in the original application as possessor of the land which she is 
claiming, appear to be flimsy by the fact that she is the wife of Senen Pandai 
who was appointed by Jose N. Garchitorena, the administrator of the estate of 
Andres Garchitorena, to take care of the lands in question.</p>
<p align="center">APPEAL OF VICENTE SOTTO</p>
<p>This appellant alleges that on March 4, 1931, the Court of First Instance of 
Manila rendered a judgment ordering Rita Garchitorena Vda. de Centenera to pay 
him the amount of P960.84; that by virtue of a writ of execution issued on March 
22, 1932, the lots in question were attached and sold at public auction, the 
sheriff issuing to appellant the deed of sale on August 7, 1934, which was later 
registered in the office of the Register of Deeds of Camarines Sur.</p>
<p>The lower court found upon the evidence that lots 2, 3, and 4 of original 
plan Psu-66063 and lots 5 and 8 of the subdivision plan Psu-66063-Amd. were 
adjudicated, by virtue of a decision of the Supreme Court on March 4, 1933, to 
Rita Garchitorena as heiress of her father, Andres Garchitorena, the 
adjudication subject to sections 712 and 713 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>Following directives in said decision, Mariano Garchitorena and brothers 
filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur against Rita 
Garchitorena, and secured a judgment on December 20, 1934, ordering Rita 
Garchitorena to deliver to the administrator of the deceased Andres Garchitorena 
the possession of the lands decreed to be adjudicated to her in this case, with 
the declaration that the creditors of the intestate of Andres Garchitorena will 
have the preferent right of retention upon said lands for costs and other 
expenses caused by delays, and that the judicial administrator of the intestate 
was authorized on July 8, 1935, against opposition of appellant Vicente Sotto, 
to sell at public auction the above five lots in order to pay the credits of 
Mariano, Flor, and Marcel Garchitorena.</p>
<p>Oppositor Vicente Sotto appealed against the order to the Supreme Court, 
which affirmed the appealed order, overruling later on several motions for 
reconsideration filed by said appellant.</p>
<p>The judicial administrator, consequently, sold at public auction on September 
7, 1935, the lots in question to Mariano Garchitorena, who happened to have 
appeared as the only buyer, at the price of P28,745.93. The deed of sale was 
executed on September 8, 1935, and approved by the court on April 26, 1940, 
against the opposition of appellant Vicente Sotto.</p>
<p>On April 27, 1939, Mariano Garchitorena bought the 500 hectares adjudicated 
by the Supreme Court to Ramon and Jose Alvarez, comprising lots 1, 6, and 7 of 
the subdivision plan Psu-66063-Amd.</p>
<p>From the foregoing undisputed facts, no issue of facts having been raised in 
any of the appeals in this case, it appears that Rita Garchitorena has never 
become the owner of the lots in question, it appearing that the adjudication 
made in her favor was subject to the provisions of sections 712 and 713 of the 
Code of Civil Procedure, which in substance means without prejudice to the 
rights of the creditors of her deceased father, Andres Garchitorena.</p>
<p>Although the Civil Code provides that succession takes effect from the time 
of the death of the owner, such provision does not create a succession which, as 
a matter of fact, does not exist, as in the case of what the deceased Andres 
Garchitorena could have left to his daughter Rita.</p>
<p>In the contemplation of the law, no succession shall be declared unless and 
until a liquidation of the assets and debts left by the deceased shall have been 
made and all his creditors fully paid. Until a final liquidation is made and all 
debts are paid, there is no way of determining if his heirs may inherit 
anything.</p>
<p>Until such a liquidation has been made, the right of heirs to inherit remains 
to be inchoate. It partakes of the nature of hope. Liquidation is necessary to 
determine if the deceased has left any liquid asset which may be transmitted to 
his heirs. Before any liquid asset is determined, all debts and obligations must 
first be liquidated and paid.</p>
<p>In the instant case it appears that after the lots in question had been sold 
at public auction to Mariano Garchitorena at the price of P28,745.93, with which 
the debt of the deceased Andres Garchitorena to Mariano, Flor, and Marcel 
Garchitorena were paid, no property or asset remained to be adjudicated to his 
daughter Rita Garchitorena. Consequently, at the public auction in which 
appellant alleges he bought the lots in question from Rita Garchitorena to 
collect the amount of P960.84, as a matter of fact appellant bought nothing, it 
appearing that what he bought as belonging to Rita Garchitorena did not belong 
to the latter.</p>
<p>Appellant alleges that he cannot be prejudiced by judgments or orders issued 
in other cases in which he has not been a party, and said other cases are the 
petition for land registration filed by Rita Garchitorena, decided by the Court 
of First Instance of Camarines Sur on May 14, 1931, with the modification 
decreed by the Supreme Court on March 4, 1933 (58 Phil., 21); civil case No. 
5782 of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur instituted by Mariano, 
Flor, and Marcel Garchitorena against Rita Garchitorena, to recover the lots in 
question, on the ground that said properties pertained really to the deceased 
Andres Garchitorena and should be made available to answer for the latter's 
debts, and the intestate of Andres Garchitorena, case No. 2881 of the Court of 
First Instance of Camarines Sur, in which proceedings took place ending in the 
sale of the lots in question to Mariano Garchitorena (SC-G. R. No. 44854).</p>
<p>In the latter case appellant filed on June 4, 1935, an opposition to have the 
properties in question sold to satisfy claims of Mariano, Flor and Marcel 
Garchitorena against the deceased Andres Garchitorena. In said opposition 
appellant alleged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Comparece Vicente Sotto, por si y en su propia representacion, como 
tercerista en este asunto, y se opone a la mocion de Mariano Garchitorena y 
Marcel Garchitorena, de fecha 20 de Mayo de 1935, pidiendo la venta en privado o 
en publica subasta de las parcelas de terreno descritas en la misma, por el 
fundamento de que el infrascrito es el unico y absoluto dueño de dichas parcelas 
de terreno.</p>
<p>"1. En los asuntos R. G. Nos. 36385 y 36547, titulados Rita Garchitorena Vda. 
de Centenera <i>contra</i> Hermogenes P. Obias et al., y Rita Garchitorena Vda. 
de Centenera <i>contra</i> El Director de Terrenos y otros, respectivamente, el 
Tribunal Supremo decreto, en decision de Marzo 4, 1933, que todas las parcelas 
de terreno descritas en la mencionada mocion fuesen registradas a nombre de Rita 
Garchitorena (Gac. Of., Vol. XXXII, No. 18, de Febrero 10, 1934.)</p>
<p>"2. En el asunto No. 38722 del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila, 
promovido por Vicente Sotto <i>contra</i> Rita Garchitorena Vda. de Centenera, 
se dicto con fecha 31 de Mayo de 1931 sentencia en favor del demandante y contra 
la demandada; y, habiendose quedado firme y ejecutoria dicha sentencia, las 
parcelas de terreno en cuestion, que son las mismas descritas en la mocion de 
que se trata en el presente asunto, fueron vendidas en publica subasta por el 
Sheriff Provincial de Camarines Sur, y adquiridas por el compareciente el 7 de 
Julio de 1933 en que se verifico dicha venta en publica subasta.</p>
<p>"3. El dia 1.° de Septiembre de 1933 se expedio por el Sheriff de Camarines 
Sur en favor del comprador Vicente Sotto el correspondiente Certificado de 
Venta, sobre dichas parcelas de terreno, y dicho certificado de venta fue 
anotado en el Registro de la Propiedad de Camarines Sur correspondiente el 20 de 
Septiembre de 1933; y</p>
<p>"4. No habiendose ejercitado por las ejecutadas en el citado asunto su 
derecho de retracto, dentro del plazo legal, el 6 de Agosto de 1934, el citado 
Sheriff Provincial de Camarines Sur expedio en favor de Vicente Sotto el 
certificado de venta absoluta, el cual fue igualmente anotado en el Registro de 
la Propiedad de Camarines Sur correspondiente en la misma fecha, y una copia del 
cual se acompaña a este asunto y se marca como Exhibito 'A-T' del infrascrito 
tercerista.</p>
<p>"De los hechos que preceden como se ve, resulta que el aqui tercerista, 
Vicente Sotto, adquirio las parcelas de terreno en cuestion en virtud de compra 
en publica subasta, anunciada y llevada a cabo por el Sheriff Provincial de 
Camarines Sur el 7 de Julio de 1933, o sea mucho antes de que este Juzgado 
dictara el 20 de Diciembre de 1934 su sentencia en el asunto No. 5782, titulado 
Mariano de Garchitorena, Flor Garchitorena y Marcel Garchitorena <i>contra</i> 
Rita Garchitorena Vda. de Centenera y Jose N. Garchitorena en su capacidad de 
administrador judicial del abintestato del finado Andres 
Garchitorena."</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellant's contentions were overruled by the Court of First Instance of 
Camarines Sur. Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, which, on December 5, 
1938 (G. R. No. 44854), overruling again appellant's contentions, among others, 
stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Claiming to have acquired title to the land in question by reason of a 
sheriff's sale made in his favor, the appellant, after obtaining a permission to 
intervene, filed a written opposition to the aforesaid motion of Mariano de 
Garchitorena, Flor Garchitorena and Marcel Garchitorena. The court below 
rejected this opposition, on the ground that, although the sheriff's sale was 
made prior to the rendition of the judgment in civil case No. 5782, it could not 
prevail against the said judgment, in view of the fact, that, prior to the sale, 
a notice of <i>lis pendens</i> was filed in connection with that case.</p>
<p>"In support of this appeal, it is now contended that the notice of <i>lis 
pendens</i> could not prejudice the right of the appellant to the land in 
question because such notice could only affect land registered under Act No. 
496. Appellant further relies on section 194 of the Administrative Code, as 
amended, which in part provides that 'any registration made under this section 
shall be understood to be without prejudice to a third party with better right.' 
The point thus raised is set at rest by the decisions of this court in Atkins, 
Kroll &amp; Company <i>vs</i>. Domingo, 46 Phil., 362, and Fetalino <i>vs</i>. 
Sanz, 44 Phil., 691. In the latter case, this court held that 'a transferee 
<i>pendente lite</i> of real property in litigation is bound by a judgment 
against his predecessor in interest and is a proper but not an indispensable 
party.'</p>
<p>"Appellant also claims that he could not be affected by the judgment rendered 
in civil case No. 5782, because it was fraudulently obtained. This contention is 
without merit. The judgment in question must be presumed to be legal and valid, 
unless shown by conclusive evidence to have obtained through fraud. No such 
evidence exists in this case."</p></blockquote>
<p>The questions raised in the above opposition are substantially the same as 
those raised in the supplementary opposition filed by appellant in the case at 
bar.</p>
<p>When Mariano Garchitorena filed on February 24, 1940, a motion for the 
approval of the sale in his favor of the lots in question, appellant filed an 
opposition, dated March 11, 1940, reiterating his alleged rights by virtue of 
the levy and sale on execution in his favor. The opposition was overruled by an 
order dated April 26, 1940, in which the sale in favor of Mariano Garchitorena 
was approved. Appellant did not appeal against said order.</p>
<p>The decision of the Supreme Court of December 5, 1938, in case G. R. No. 
44854 and the unappealed order of the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur 
dated April 26, 1940, and special proceeding No. 2881 had finally settled the 
questions raised by the appellant.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, finding no merit in the appeals of appellants H. P. 
Obias, Ana Pataan, and Vicente Sotto, the order of the lower court dated June 
28, 1941, is affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Paras,

<div align="center"><br><br><em>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur partly in the disposition of the case as regards the parcels of land 
decreed by this Court in G. R. Nos. 36385 and 35547 in favor of Rita 
Garchitorena, and dissent from the remainder of the majority decision which 
affects the parcels covered by the oppositions of the herein 
opponents-appellants.</p>
<p>These latter parcels, whose registration the majority decision also decrees 
in favor of movant-appellee Mariano Garchitorena, were never applied for in an 
application for registration, nor the subject of a like petition on the part of 
any opponent in the original registration cases which, after having been 
appealed to this court, were docketed and disposed of herein under G. R. Nos. 
36385 and 36547 (<i>see</i> 58 Phil., 21). Those cases were instituted, 
prosecuted and decided under Act No. 496. The judgment of this Court disposing 
of said cases and promulgated on March 4, 1933, and elevated to the authority of 
<i>res judicata</i> seven years before the motion now under consideration was 
filed in the court below, and more than fourteen years ago today, upheld the 
oppositions filed by the Director of Lands, Hermogenes P. Obias (18 hectares), 
Ramon and Jose Alvarez (500 hectares), and Januario Alferez (24 hectares), and 
ordered the amendment of the Plan Psu-66063 "so as to exclude the portions of 
land pertaining to said opponents." No affirmative relief was granted said 
opponents in the sense of decreeing the registration in their favor of the 
parcels of land respectively covered by their oppositions.</p>
<p>Before the amendment of sections 34, 37, and 38 of Act No. 496 by sections 1, 
2, and 3 of Act No. 3621, the court had no jurisdiction to decree <i>in the same 
proceeding</i> the registration in favor of the opponent, even though it should 
find that, as between the applicant and the opponent, the land belonged to the 
latter. In Tecson <i>vs</i>. Corporacion de los PP. Dominicos (19 Phil., 79, 
80), this Court, <i>inter alia</i>, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * this court has held heretofore that the jurisdiction of the Land Court 
extends no further than the inscription of the land described in its final 
decree and the enforcement of that decree, and that, even though the land 
described in the petition be found by the court, as between the petitioner and 
the <i>oppositor</i>, to be the property of the opponent, such land can not be 
inscribed in his name, the Land Court having, as we have said, no jurisdiction 
or power to do so. It naturally and necessarily follows that the opponent, if he 
desires the land of which he claims ownership to be registered in accordance 
with law, must begin a new proceeding in the Land Court for that 
purpose."</p></blockquote>
<p>In this consisted at that time, the difference between registration 
proceedings under Act No. 496 and those under Chapter VI of Act No. 926. (Sec. 
64, latter Act.)</p>
<p>On December 5, 1929, section 34 of Act No. 496, it is true, was amended by 
section 1 of Act No. 3621, so that the second sentence thereof thereafter reads 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The answer (or opposition, as it is often called) shall state all the 
objections to the application, and shall set forth the interest claimed by the 
party filing the same <i>and apply for the remedy desired</i>, and shall be 
signed and sworn to by him or by some person in his behalf."</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 37 of Act No. 496 was also amended by section 2 of Act No. 3621, so 
that it partly read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 37. *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"* * * in a case where there is an adverse claim, the court shall determine 
the conflicting interests of the applicant and the adverse claimant, and after 
taking evidence shall dismiss the application if neither of them succeeds in 
showing that he has proper title for registration, or shall enter a decree 
awarding the land <i>applied for</i>, or any part thereof, to the person 
entitled thereto * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>But even after the amendment, the underscored portions of the above-quoted 
provisions clearly contemplate that in order for the opponent to obtain from the 
court a decree of registration, <i>he must apply for the same remedy</i>.</p>
<p>It is likewise true that the same amending act reformed section 38 of Act No. 
496 so that said section thereafter read thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 38. If the court after hearing finds that the applicant or adverse 
claimant has title as stated in his application or adverse claim and proper for 
registration, a decree of confirmation and registration shall be 
entered."</p></blockquote>
<p>There can be no dispute that in the original registration cases under 
consideration, no positive decree of registration was prayed for by any 
opponent, as categorically required by section 34 of Act No. 496, as amended; 
and certainly none has been decreed by the above-mentioned final judgment of 
this Court, which was beyond its power to amend, much less that of the lower 
court, when the latter in granting the motion under consideration attempted to 
do so. It seems to me evident, therefore, that even if the opponents themselves 
had sought such an amendment, it could not have been legally made at such a late 
date for the simple reason that they had not applied for a decree of 
registration in their opposition as required in said provision, and furthermore, 
because the judgment of this Court had long before become final and irrevocable. 
If the opponents themselves could not legally have achieved such an end, how 
could their successor in interest, the movant-appellee?</p>
<p>What could be the purpose of Act No. 3621, section 1, amending Act No. 496, 
section 34, in providing that the opponent shall "apply for the remedy desired"? 
It is to be presumed that this phrase was there used for a purpose—it would be 
an insult to the intelligence of the lawmaker to understand the contrary. What 
could be that purpose? To my mind, it could only be to establish a basis for the 
court's jurisdiction to decree registration in favor of the opponent and a 
condition precedent for the exercise thereof. The law undoubtedly aimed at duly 
apprising the applicant and any other adverse claimants that such opponent was 
asserting a right to the registration and was praying for that remedy, so that 
such applicant and other adverse claimants could duly meet the pretensions of 
said opponent and protect their rights and interests accordingly. Under the 
provision, if the opponent applied for a positive registration in his favor as 
the remedy that he desired, in case he should prove title in himself proper for 
registration, the court would have jurisdiction to grant him that remedy. To say 
now that even if he should <i>not</i> apply for the remedy the court could still 
grant it to him, would be tantamount to declaring the quoted phrase utterly 
useless and devoid of meaning.</p>
<p>In Government of the Philippine Islands <i>vs</i>. Tombis Triño (50 Phil., 
708, 718), this Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In a cadastral proceeding, a court has no jurisdiction to decree a lot to 
one who has put in no claim to it. The written declaration claiming certain 
described property is the very basis of jurisdiction to render a judgment. * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p>While the present case is not concerned with a cadastral proceeding, it 
involves the registration of land like such a proceeding and, as is well known, 
a claim in a cadastral proceeding, which is denominated "answer" is for the 
express purpose of securing the registration of the land covered thereby in the 
name of the claimant. That "answer" is the pleading which the claimant files in 
view of and against the petition or application of the Director of Lands which 
starts the case, in much the same way as an opposition or adverse claim in an 
ordinary registration case is in answer to the application of the applicant 
which commences the latter proceeding. Hence, in my opinion, the doctrine above 
quoted from the Triño case is perfectly applicable herein.</p>
<p>It is likewise true that after Act No. 3621, more specifically on November 
17, 1931, Act No. 3901 was enacted, amending section 29 of Act No. 496 so as to 
read in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 29. After the filing of the <i>application</i> and before the issuance 
of the decree of title by the Chief of the General Land Registration Office the 
land therein described may be dealt with and instruments relating thereto shall 
be recorded in the office of the register of deeds at any time before the 
issuance of the decree of title, in the same manner as if no application had 
been made. The interested party may, however, present such instruments to the 
Court of First Instance instead of presenting them to the office of the register 
of deeds, together with a motion that the same be considered in relation with 
the <i>application</i>, and the court, after notice to the parties, shall order 
such land registered subject to the incumbrance created by said instruments, or 
order the decree of registration issued in the name of the buyer or of the 
person to whom the property has been conveyed by said instruments. If such 
motion is made after the decision has become final, the court shall require the 
interested party, before granting his motion, to pay the fees which the register 
of deeds would collect in accordance with section one hundred and fourteen of 
this Act, as amended, if such instruments had been presented for registration in 
the office of the register of deeds after registration of the original 
certificate of title. If the order of the court above mentioned is received by 
the Chief of the Land Registration Office after issuance of the decree of title, 
such order shall forthwith be forwarded by said officer to the register of deeds 
concerned, for compliance therewith. If the proceedings upon the 
<i>application</i> end in the issuance of a decree of title, the property 
included therein shall, as soon as said decree has been registered in the office 
of the register of deeds, as provided in section forty-one, become registered 
land under this Act, * * *." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, under the provision just quoted it was proper for the lower court 
to decree the registration in favor of movant-appellee of the parcels of land 
whose registration was ordered in favor of Rita Garchitorena, as original 
applicant, in G. R. Nos. 36385 and 36547, but "the court shall require the 
interested party, before granting his motion, to pay the fees which the register 
of deeds would collect in accordance with section one hundred and fourteen of 
this Act, as amended, if such instruments had been presented for registration in 
the office of the register of deeds after registration of the original 
certificate of title."</p>
<p>It is clear from the section last above quoted that its provisions are 
confined to the <i>application</i> which starts the registration proceedings. 
The phrase "after the filing of the application" in its first sentence can not 
refer but to that which the applicant files, and this is the self-same 
application which is alluded to in the remainder of the section. If so, the 
provisions of said section do not apply to the <i>opposition</i> filed by the 
opponent. The writer does not mean to be technical at all, but merely acts upon 
the principle that this Court has to exercise its jurisdiction and powers <i>by 
authority of law</i>. Where the law-making body has seen fit to confine the 
provision to the <i>application</i>, it is not for this Court to say that it 
would be more practical to extend it to the opposition. Where the law is clear, 
the duty of the court is merely to apply it. Construction would be out of place 
and, if attempted, would be no more nor less than judicial legislation. It would 
be just as obnoxious to our system of government for the courts to legislate in 
the matter of their own jurisdiction as it would be for the legislature to 
render judgment upon purely judicial questions.</p>I am forced to the conclusion 
that movant-appellee (<i>a</i>) must pay the fees above mentioned pursuant to 
section 29 of Act No. 496, as amended, as a condition precedent to the 
registration in his name of the parcels of land adjudicated to Rita 
Garchitorena, and (<i>b</i>) must file a separate proceeding for the 
registration of the parcels of land covered by the said oppositions or any of 
them, in the regular manner and following the regular procedure.</div>
