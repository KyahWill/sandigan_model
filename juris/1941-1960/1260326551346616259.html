				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From a judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance of Manila denying his petition for naturalization, Manuel So alias Tan Deit appeals to this Court.<br><br>On 16 February 1954, the petitioner filed in the Office of the Solicitor General a sworn declaration of his intention to become a citizen of the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit U.)&nbsp;&nbsp; On 10 October&nbsp; 1955, he filed a sworn petition for naturalization in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila (civil No. 27814) where he avers that he is a citizen pf the Republic of China, born on 1 May 1918&nbsp; in&nbsp; Chuan Chiu, Amoy, China, under the laws&nbsp; of which&nbsp; Filipinos may become citizens by naturalization;&nbsp; that sometime in 1937 he immigrated to the Philippines and arrived in Manila on board the <span style="font-style: italic;">SS Ang Khing;</span>&nbsp; that since then he has resided&nbsp; continuously&nbsp; in the Philippines for a&nbsp; period of seventeen years; that&nbsp; he is married to Remedios&nbsp; B. Santos, who before her marriage to him, was a citizen of the Philippines; that out&nbsp; of&nbsp; their marital union, they have begotten three children namely,&nbsp; Manuel, Jr., Felix and Angelito; that he is a&nbsp; merchant with an average&nbsp; annual income of P5,000; that&nbsp; he can speak&nbsp; and write English&nbsp; and Tagalog; that he believes in the principles&nbsp; underlying the Constitution of the Philippines; that&nbsp; he has&nbsp; mingled socially with the Filipinos&nbsp; and has evinced&nbsp; a&nbsp; sincere&nbsp; desire to&nbsp; learn&nbsp; and embrace their customs, traditions and ideals; and that he has all the qualifications and&nbsp; none of the disqualifications to become a citizen of the Philippines.&nbsp; As character or vouching witnesses, he cites Iluminado&nbsp; G. Roxas, Mariano F. Almeda,&nbsp; Jr., and Jesus&nbsp; Carrasco.&nbsp;&nbsp; After due&nbsp; publication&nbsp; and hearing the Court&nbsp; denied&nbsp; his petition.&nbsp; Hence this&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>The&nbsp; denial of his petition is predicated upon&nbsp; the following:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; two character or vouching witnesses presented&nbsp; by the petitioner hardly know him, their knowledge&nbsp; of him being merely&nbsp; casual and not sufficient&nbsp; for a just&nbsp; evaluation&nbsp; of his character and real intention; and that&nbsp; their testimony&nbsp; is&nbsp; vacillating,&nbsp; incomplete, unsatisfactory, and is based on&nbsp; mere conjecture without sufficient grounds on which to base their opinion; (2) that the petitioner knows&nbsp; very little of our&nbsp; Constitution despite the fact that he claims he believes&nbsp; in the principles&nbsp; underlying&nbsp; it,&nbsp; which principles he&nbsp; could not mention;&nbsp; and (3) that "his conduct during&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; and the manner in&nbsp; which he testified&nbsp; show that he&nbsp; studied well the&nbsp; law on the subject, although&nbsp; his testimony lacks the sincerity of a&nbsp; person who&nbsp; talks from his&nbsp; heart and not by mere memory."<br><br>Iluminado Roxas testifies that&nbsp; he&nbsp; knew the&nbsp; petitioner for thirteen&nbsp; years before he took the witness stand, having met him in&nbsp; Dart, Paco, Manila, sometimes in 1943 when he and his family moved there and where he opened a&nbsp; small store selling cosmetics; that they were&nbsp; neighbors from 1943 to&nbsp; 1945; that&nbsp; in 1945&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; Quiapo to open a&nbsp; small store near the market; that at&nbsp; present he&nbsp; lives on Evangelista&nbsp; street where&nbsp; he&nbsp; has a&nbsp; store selling laces,&nbsp; buttons, thread, buckles&nbsp; and other goods; that he knows his wife Remedios B. Santos, who was a Filipino citizen at&nbsp; the time of&nbsp; her marriage&nbsp; to&nbsp; the petitioner; that he and&nbsp; the petitioner are close friends; that they often go together to&nbsp; church, to excursions&nbsp; and parties because their respective&nbsp; families are intimate with each&nbsp; other;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; everyday he&nbsp; is at&nbsp; the petitioner's place of business.<br><br>Jesus Carrasco testifies that he&nbsp; knew the petitioner&nbsp; for ten or eleven years before&nbsp; he gave his testimony, having met him sometime in&nbsp; 1945 or&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; at his&nbsp; (the&nbsp; witness') barbershop in Quiapo&nbsp; where he used to have his haircut; that he knows the petitioner's wife,&nbsp; Remedios B. Santos, who was a Filipino citizen at the time of her marriage to the petitioner; that he often sees the petitioner because they invite each other to their respective parties; and that they sometimes go&nbsp; out&nbsp; together&nbsp; with their families&nbsp; to Antipolo and other places.<br><br>The fact that Iluminado Roxas had known the petitioner for thirteen years before&nbsp; he testified, having met him in 1943; that they were neighbors in Paco from 1943 to 1945 and became close friends; and that they often go together to&nbsp; church and to excursions&nbsp; and attend each other's parties, qualified him to vouch for his character and conduct. Likewise,&nbsp; the fact&nbsp; that Jesus Carrasco&nbsp; had known the petitioner for ten or eleven years&nbsp; before&nbsp; giving his testimony in&nbsp; Court; that as they are friends they sometimes go out together with their respective families and attend each other's&nbsp; parties, placed&nbsp; him in a position to&nbsp; vouch for the petitioner's character and conduct.&nbsp; Their friendly association with the petitioner has&nbsp; placed them in&nbsp; close and intimate&nbsp; contact&nbsp; with&nbsp; him and&nbsp; has enabled&nbsp; them to&nbsp; observe him at close range.&nbsp; Thus, according to&nbsp; them, their opinion that he has mingled socially with the Filipinos and that he is a good member of the community is borne out by the fact that he helps the poor by giving them alms and employs Filipinos in&nbsp; his place of business.<br><br>The petitioner speaks and writes&nbsp; Tagalog&nbsp; and English, and has satisfied the required degree of&nbsp; proficiency.&nbsp; He testified partly&nbsp; in English&nbsp; and in&nbsp; Tagalog.&nbsp;&nbsp; On cross-examination,&nbsp; he wrote&nbsp; the following&nbsp; sentence dictated to him by the Solicitor: "The sun shines in the&nbsp; east and sets in&nbsp; the west" and translated it into Tagalog as follows: "Ang araw ay sumisikat sa silangan&nbsp; at lumulubug sa kanluran."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit X.)&nbsp;&nbsp; He has taken for wife a woman who at the&nbsp; time of her marriage to him was a citizen of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B).&nbsp; All of&nbsp; these&nbsp; taken together&nbsp; evince a sincere desire on his part&nbsp; to&nbsp; become&nbsp; a citizen&nbsp; of the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that he had all his three children&nbsp; baptized in the Roman&nbsp; Catholic&nbsp; Church and gave them the Filipino&nbsp; names of Manuel,&nbsp; Jr.,&nbsp; Felix and Angelito (Exhibits D,&nbsp; D-l and D-2);&nbsp; and that he himself adopted a Filipino name, strengthens the conclusion that&nbsp; the petitioner has&nbsp; embraced the&nbsp; customs and traditions of the Filipinos.<br><br>On direct examination,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; testified that&nbsp; he believes&nbsp; in the principles&nbsp; underlying the Philippine Constitution.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; cross-examination&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Solicitor,&nbsp; he answered as follows:<br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You said that you believe in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution.
