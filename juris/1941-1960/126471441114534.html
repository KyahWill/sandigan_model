				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These  are  four  petitions  for  a writ  of  certiorari,  to annul an  order of respondent, Hon. Manuel M. Mejia,  as Judge of First Instance of Cebu, dated February 22, 1955, denying a motion of petitioner herein, Bisaya Land Transportation  Co., Inc., as  defendant  in civil cases Nos.  R-1768, R-1769, R-1775 and R-1776 of said court, for the suspension of the trial of said cases until  the rendition of final judgment in criminal case No. V-3142 of the same court.  Upon  the  filing  of  the  corresponding bond,  we issued a writ of preliminary injunction directing respondent judge to desist and refrain, until further orders from this Court, from  trying  or  hearing the four civil  cases already referred to.</p>
<p>It appears  that  on  November 1, 1951,  Tan Sim's cargo truck No. T-17137, driven by Antonio Varga, and passenger truck No.  TPU-10284  of  petitioner  Bisaya  Land Transportation Co., Inc.,  driven by Teofilo Mongaya, collided with each other in  the municipality of Compostela, province  of Cebu.  As a consequence, the  passenger of the  latter  truck  sustained physical injuries, and  some of  them  died.  Hence, on January 17, 1952, the provincial fiscal of Cebu commenced criminal case No. V-3142 of the Court of First Instance of Cebu  entitled  "People vs.  Antonio Varga and  Teofilo  Mongaya"—the  drivers of both trucks—for multiple  homicide  with serious, less serious and slight  physical injuries^ through reckless imprudence.  Moreover, the  heirs of Jose-Yap Cabatingan, Jose Pestano, Cresencia Placencia and Lucas Maramara, some of  the deceased passengers  of the  Bisaya truck No, TPU-10284, instituted in said court, the following civil cases, for damages allegedly sustained by reason of the accident above mentioned:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Civil Case No. R-1768,  entitled  "Angel Cabatingan, et al. vs. Bisaya Land Transportation Co.,  Inc.,  Antonio Varga and Tan Sim;"<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Civil Case No.  R-1769, entitled  "Nely E.  Pestano et al. vs. Bisaya Land Transportation Co.,  Inc.,  Antonio Varga and Tan Sim";<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Civil Case No. R-1775,  entitled  "Macaria Tolda  de Placeneia et  al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Bisaya Land Transportation Co., Inc., Antonio Varga and Tan Sim";  and<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Civil Case No.  R-1776,  entitled "Teofila Misa,  et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Bisaya Land  Transportation  Co.,  Inc.,  Antonio Varga and Tan Sim."</li>
</ol>
<p>On or about February  17,  1955, petitioner herein filed a motion,  in said four (4)  civil cases, praying that the trial thereof, which was scheduled to take place,  jointly,  on February 22, 1955, before the Fifth Branch of the Court of First Instance  of Cebu, presided over by  respondent Judge, be  suspended  until final disposition of the afore-mentioned criminal case No. V-3142, the hearing of which had already begun.  This motion was  denied by an order of respondent Judge dated February 22, 1955.  On  the same date, however, respondent Judge issued another order, postponing the hearing of said civil  cases  to  March 4, 1955,  so that petitioner may have an  opportunity to seek from  this  Court such relief as  it may deem fit.   Hence, soon thereafter, petitioner instituted the cases at bar, for the purpose  of annulling said order denying the  motion for suspension of  the hearing of the civil cases  already adverted to.</p>
<p>Petitioner  assails said order, upon  the ground  that it was issued by respondent Judge with  abuse  of discretion, and without, or in excess  of  his, jurisdiction, as  well  as in  violation of Rule  107,  section  1(<em>c</em>),  of the Rules of Court and of the  doctrines  laid  down  in the  cases of Francisco vs.  Onrubia,  46 Phil.,  327 and De Leon  vs. Mabanag, 70 Phil., 202.  However, said provision of the Rules of Court and the decisions  cited are not in  point. Section 1(<em>c</em>)  of  Rule 107 of the Rules of Court refers to civil  actions "arising from the same offense"  charged in the criminal action.   Such was the civil action instituted by  Francisco against Onrubia, <em>supra,</em> who, while driving a car, hit a pedestrian with whom he had no  contractual relation  whatsoever), killing  the latter.   A judgment of acquittal having been rendered in the corresponding  criminal action against Onrubia, for homicide through reckless negligence, it followed that the civil  action for damages, based upon the crime allegedly committed by  him,  could not prosper.  Upon the other hand,  the principle enunciated in the De Leon  case, <em>supra,</em>  is,  at best, adverse to petitioner's  contention,  it having  been  held, in said case, that a pending civil action,  hinging upon the genuineness or spurious nature  of  a given document, had to  be  decided before a criminal action for  alleged  falsification  of said document be instituted.</p>
<p>Insofar as! herein  petitioner  is concerned, the   complaints in the civil cases aforementioned are  specifically based  upon an alleged breach of the "contractual"  relation between said petitioner, as owner  and operator of truck  No.  TPU-10284, and  its passengers, Jose   Cabatingan, Jose Pestano,  Cresencia Placencia and  Lucas Maramara,  which relation is  governed  by Articles  1755 to 1763  of  the Civil Code of the  Philippines, not  by the Revised  Penal Code, and is, therefore, independent of the provisions of the latter and of such criminal responsibility as may  exist thereunder.   Indeed,  Articles 31  and  33 of the Civil Code of the Philippines  explicitly provide:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"ART. 31. When the civil action is based on  an obligation not arising from the act or omission complained of as a  felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings and  regardless of the result of the latter."</p>
  <p>"ART. 88. In cases of defamation, fraud,  and physical injuries, a  civil action  for damages, entirely separate  and  distinct from " the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party.  Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution, and  shall require only  a preponderance of evidence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of these  clear and positive legal precepts  and in line with the well established  practice  in  this  jurisdiction (Rakes <em>vs. </em>Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co., 7 Phil., 359, 362-365; Barredo <em>vs.</em> GTarcia  and Almario,  73 Phil., 607, 611; Ramcar <em>vs.</em> De Leon, 44  Off. Gaz., 3795; Castro <em>vs.</em> Aero  Taxicab Co., 46 Off.  Gaz., 2023; San Pedro Bus Line  <em>vs.</em>  Navarro,   94  Phil.,  846,  decided  on  April 29,  1954;  Son<em> vs.</em>  Cebu Autobus Co.,  94  Phil.,  892, decided April 30,  1954; Ibañez  et al.  <em>vs.</em> North Negros Sugar  Co.,  96 Phil.,  980,  decided  March  28,  1955; Carandang<em> vs.</em>  Santiago,  97  Phil.,  94,  decided  May 25, 1955), we hold that, as regards  petitioner herein, the aforementioned civil cases Nos. R-1768, R-1769, R-1775 and R-1776 may proceed independently of said  criminal case  No.  V-3142 and that,  accordingly,  His Honor, respondent  judge, did not err  in issuing  the  order complained of.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petitions are dismissed and  the writ of preliminary  injunction heretofore issued hereby  dissolved and  set aside,  with costs against the petitioner.  It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C.  J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo,  Bautista Angelo,  Labrador,  Reyes, J.  B.  L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
