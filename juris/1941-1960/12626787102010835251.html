				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from&nbsp; an&nbsp; order of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila, Hon. Gregorio Narvasa, presiding, which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore, the said counsel&nbsp; for plaintiff are hereby&nbsp; declared in contempt of court, and it appearing that it&nbsp; was&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Eugenio de Gracia of the law firm who received from the Sheriff of Manila a check for the amount of P463.70, it is hereby ordered that said Atty. de Gracia be placed in custody&nbsp; and kept in confinement by the Sheriff until the Order of April 28,&nbsp; 1957, directing the return of the amount therein mentioned&nbsp; to defendant is&nbsp; complied with, or until further order."<br></blockquote>The proceedings leading to the&nbsp; issuance of the&nbsp; above order are briefly stated as&nbsp; follows:<br><br>In C. A.-G. R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 15437-R, entitled&nbsp; "Maximo Galvez, plaintiff-appellee&nbsp; vs. Republic Surety &amp; Insurance&nbsp; Co., defendant-appellant," the Court of Appeals awarded&nbsp; costs to appellee Galvez.&nbsp; Thereupon, the attorneys of Galvez, namely, Raquiza,&nbsp; Supnet,&nbsp; De&nbsp; Gracia and Asuncion, filed with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clerk of&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Manila a&nbsp; bill&nbsp; of costs, in the total&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P502.35.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bill&nbsp; was&nbsp; received&nbsp; by the office of the clerk of court on January 17, and on that same date attorney&nbsp; for defendant-appellant received copy thereof.&nbsp; As&nbsp; no opposition was forthcoming, counsel for Galvez filed an ex-parte motion for execution on January 23,&nbsp; but the following&nbsp; day the motion for execution was. withdrawn and another filed.&nbsp; On January 25,&nbsp; a writ of execution was issued, but on the previous day, January 24,&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; for the Republic Surety&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an opposition to the bill, claiming that as the judgment of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance appealed from made&nbsp; no finding as to costs and only the decision of the Court of Appeals granted costs to appellee, the total&nbsp;&nbsp; amount&nbsp; recoverable&nbsp; should only be P60.00.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the&nbsp; difficulty on the part of the court to&nbsp; determine what was meant by&nbsp; the grant of costs in general terms by the Court&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp; Judge Narvasa issued&nbsp; an order dated February 2,&nbsp; granting the defendant-appellant five days&nbsp; within which to seek clarification of the&nbsp; decision of&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Appeals as to costs.&nbsp; On February 13, as nothing appears to&nbsp; have been made by the appellant to clarify&nbsp; the grant of costs in the Court of Appeals, Judge&nbsp; Narvasa, upon an ex-parte motion of appellee's counsel, ordered, the sheriff to deliver the amount to said counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon counsel for appellant&nbsp; moved to reconsider&nbsp; the order, saying that the petition for clarification was filed on February&nbsp; 7&nbsp; in the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; meantime, however,&nbsp; the writ of execution&nbsp; issued on&nbsp; January 25 had&nbsp; been carried out and&nbsp; funds&nbsp; of the appellant in the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; of Commerce were garnished to the amount of P472.67.&nbsp; The amount&nbsp; was collected by the clerk of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance on January 27, 1957.&nbsp; The same was received by Atty. De Gracia of the&nbsp; law firm which is the counsel for appellee.<br><br>The motion filed by appellant in the Court of Appeals to clarify the&nbsp; grant of costs&nbsp; in that court was acted upon by the said court&nbsp; on February 22, 1957, in a resolution to the effect that the costs granted are those incurred&nbsp; in the&nbsp; appellate court only.&nbsp; This resolution&nbsp; was presented to the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; by counsel for appellant and received&nbsp; by the clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; court on March 13,&nbsp; 1957.&nbsp; On March&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for appellee&nbsp; filed an opposition to&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; of&nbsp; counsel for appellant,&nbsp; to reduce the&nbsp; costs&nbsp; to&nbsp; P20,&nbsp; and to&nbsp; return the balance of the costs already paid to them.&nbsp; On March 16, the&nbsp; court granted&nbsp; the petition of appellant's counsel, reducing costs to P20.00, and ordered the return of the balance of P473.00 to the appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration of the order was presented on March 19, and after the presentation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the opposition and&nbsp; the reply thereto, the&nbsp; court was informed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the sheriff that the amount ordered to be returned,&nbsp; P473, to the&nbsp; appellant,&nbsp; had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been received&nbsp; on February 14 by Atty. De Gracia of the law firm of Raquiza, et al.,&nbsp; counsel for the appellee.&nbsp; As the court found out that the writ of execution for the payment of costs&nbsp; had&nbsp; already been&nbsp; executed, the court set&nbsp; aside its order for the return (by the sheriff)&nbsp; of the excess in the costs to&nbsp; the appellant on March 25.&nbsp; On April 16, the court entered&nbsp; another order&nbsp; requiring the appellee's counsel to return to the appellant the amount&nbsp; of P473.&nbsp; Notice of this order&nbsp; was&nbsp; served on appellee's counsel&nbsp; on April 22, 1957. On April 29, the clerk of court manifested that he had required counsel for the appellee&nbsp; to return the sum of P473 within five&nbsp; days, and that the&nbsp; period of time given has already expired without the return being&nbsp; made. Thereupon counsel&nbsp; for appellant asked for the issuance of a writ of execution against the properties of counsel for appellee,&nbsp; to enforce&nbsp; payment of the amount of P473. Opposition to this motion was presented, but on May 24, the court directed counsel for the appellee to comply with the order dated&nbsp; April 16, requiring them&nbsp; to return the sum of P473 within 10 days from notice, copy of&nbsp; this order was served on said counsel on May 27.&nbsp; Appellee's counsel question&nbsp; the validity of this order of the&nbsp; court, alleging that the amount of F400, out of the sum of P473 received&nbsp; by them, constitute premiums paid by&nbsp; appellee on the injunction bond filed&nbsp; in the Court of Appeals, and that the same&nbsp; was&nbsp; recoverable&nbsp; as&nbsp; part&nbsp; of the costs in the appellate&nbsp; court.&nbsp; As no payment&nbsp; was forthcoming, on June 7, 1957, appellant's counsel moved the court to declared&nbsp; appellee's&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; in&nbsp; contempt,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; court issued&nbsp; an order requiring said counsel to&nbsp; show cause why they should not&nbsp; be&nbsp; declared in&nbsp; contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 26, after hearing the explanations given by appellee's counsel. the court issued the&nbsp; order in question.<br><br>The&nbsp; ground stated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; order&nbsp; why the action of appellee's counsel is contemptuous was their knowledge that the motion for clarification&nbsp; was filed&nbsp; on February 7, in the Court of Appeals, to which they had filed an opposition on February 11, but that&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; this fact they still&nbsp; filed an urgent&nbsp; ex-parte motion for execution, knowing that the Court&nbsp; of Appeals had not yet&nbsp; resolved the motion for clarification.<br><br>On this appeal, it is claimed that the action of appellee's counsel is not&nbsp; contemptuous, for the reason that it&nbsp; was appellant Republic&nbsp;&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; itself that&nbsp; had delayed presentation of motion for clarification because it did so only on February 7,&nbsp; the last day.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order of the&nbsp; court did not state that appellant&nbsp; was to get the order from the Court pf Appeals within&nbsp; five days;&nbsp; the court&nbsp; only requires the appellant to present a motion for clarification within five days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Granting that&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; may have&nbsp; misunderstood the order, it is apparent that knowing as&nbsp; they did that&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for clarification&nbsp; was&nbsp; still&nbsp; pending, they took advantage&nbsp; of the delay to&nbsp; secure delivery to them of the excessive costs.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; also contended that&nbsp; the order of the court&nbsp; constitutes&nbsp; imprisonment for non-payment of a questionable debt.&nbsp; We do&nbsp; not find merit in&nbsp; this contention.&nbsp; Appellant does not&nbsp; claim&nbsp; that he no&nbsp; longer has possession of the disputed&nbsp; amount of money.&nbsp; A cursory&nbsp; reading of the order would show that it only requires compliance with a simple order of the court to return the excess costs&nbsp; paid to them, and&nbsp; this order dates back as early as&nbsp; April 16, 1957.&nbsp; The order appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; was issued only&nbsp; after' the lapse&nbsp; of 70 days from&nbsp; the first order&nbsp; requiring the return.&nbsp; Certainly, courts should not tolerate this unjustifiable delay&nbsp; in returning sums obtained&nbsp; under&nbsp; doubtful conditions.&nbsp; It is only by a&nbsp; threat of&nbsp; imprisonment&nbsp; that a court&nbsp; can compel&nbsp; respect for it&nbsp; and obedience to its orders.&nbsp; The order&nbsp; is expressly in accordance with&nbsp; Section 7 of&nbsp; Rule 64 of the Rules of Court,&nbsp; which&nbsp; provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Imprisonment until order obeyed</span>.— When the contempt consists in the omission to do an act which is yet in the power of the accused&nbsp; to perform, he may be imprisoned by order of a superior court until&nbsp; he performs it."<br></blockquote>In Harden <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Director of Prisons, 81 Phil. 741, 748, we explained&nbsp; the nature of the above-quoted provisions, thus:<br><blockquote>"As stated in&nbsp; a more recent case (De Wees [1948], 210 S.W., 2d, 145-147, 'to order that&nbsp; one&nbsp; be&nbsp; imprisoned&nbsp; for&nbsp; an indefinite period in&nbsp; a civil contempt is purely a remedial measure.&nbsp; Its purpose is to&nbsp; coerce&nbsp; the contemner to do&nbsp; an act within his or her power to perform.&nbsp; He must&nbsp; have&nbsp; the&nbsp; means&nbsp; by&nbsp; which&nbsp; he may purge himself of the contempt.&nbsp; The latter decision cites Staley <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> South Jersey Realty Co.,&nbsp; 83 N. J. Eq., 300, 90 A., 1042,&nbsp; 1043, in which the theory is expressed in this&nbsp; language:<br><br>" In&nbsp; a "civil contempt" the proceeding is remedial, it is a step in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; the object&nbsp; of&nbsp; which is&nbsp; to&nbsp; coerce one party for the benefit&nbsp; of the other party to do or to refrain from doing some act&nbsp; specified&nbsp; in&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of the court.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; if imprisonment be ordered, it is&nbsp; remedial&nbsp; in purpose and coercive in character, and to that end must relate to something to be done by the defendant by the&nbsp; doing of&nbsp; which&nbsp; he may discharge himself.&nbsp; As quaintly expressed, the imprisoned man "carried&nbsp; the keys&nbsp; to his prison in bis own pocket.'"<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; is hereby affirmed,&nbsp; and compliance&nbsp; therewith&nbsp; insofar as it requires&nbsp; return&nbsp; of the amount of&nbsp; P472.00 to&nbsp; the appellant is hereby ordered. otherwise said order&nbsp; would&nbsp; be enforced according to its terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
