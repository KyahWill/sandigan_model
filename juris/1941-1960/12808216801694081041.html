				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance
 of Manila the dispositive part of which reads as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Wherefore, the petition for certiorari and mandamus filed by 
Ignacio Llanco is hereby granted, declaring all proceedings taken by the
 respondents in the suspension and discharge of the petitioner to be 
null and void, and ordering the respondents Mayor, Chief of Police, and 
Presiding Officer of the Police Summary Court of the City of Manila, or 
their successors, to reinstate the said petitioner Ignacio Llanco as 
patrolman in the Manila Police Department and to pay him his salary at 
the rate of P135 a month from July 6, 1951, when he was illegally 
discharged from the service, until his reinstatement as patrolman in the
 Police Department of the City of Manila."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The petitioner-appellee, a member of the Manila Police 
Department, was dismissed from the service by the respondent Mayor on 
June 26, 1951, on recommendation of the summary court of the Manila 
Police Department which conducted the investigation of certain 
administrative charges against the appellee.  The main issue raised in 
the present appeal is whether, as held by the lower court, section 22 of
 Republic Act No. 409, known as the Revised Charter of the City of 
Manila, had been repealed by Republic Act No. 557 which provides that 
charges against members of city police shall be preferred by the City 
Mayor and investigated by the Municipal Board.  In G.R. No. L-5009, 
Manuel vs. de la Fuente, et al., decided on November 29, 1952, we 
already held that Republic Act No. 557 has repealed or modified section 
22 of Republic Act No. 409, insofar as the power of investigation of 
members of the Manila Police Department is concerned.  In said case we 
found that the Municipal Board has been granted the exclusive power to 
investigate, with the Mayor being conferred only the power to prefer 
charges against any member of the city police, although the Mayor, for 
the purpose of determining whether he should exercise the power of 
suspension conferred upon him by Republic Act No. 557, may conduct his 
own investigation, but this inquiry cannot replace the investigation 
required to be conducted by the Municipal Board which should form the 
basis for final administrative action or decision by said Board 
appealable to the Commissioner of Civil Service.  The investigation 
conducted by the summary court of the Manila Police Department in the 
case at bar and the removal based thereon not being in conformity with 
the provisions of Republic Act No. 557, the same must be held — as in 
the case of Manuel <i>vs.</i> de la Fuente, et al., <i>supra</i> — to be
 of no force and effect.</p>
  <p>    Counsel for the appellant has intimated — though not raised in 
respondents' answer in the court below — that Republic Act No. 557 would
 be rendered unconstitutional if construed as repealing section 22 of 
Republic Act No. 409, because while its title speaks of "the suspension 
or removal of members of the provincial governor, city mayor or 
municipal mayor," the body of the Act vests the same power in the 
provincial board and municipal or city council, in violation of section 
21 of Article VI of the Constitution providing that no bill which may be
 enacted into law shall embody more than one subject which shall be 
expressed in the title of the bill.  From a reading of Republic Act No. 
557, however, it is plain that the provincial governor, city mayor and 
municipal mayor are conferred the power of suspension conformably to the
 provisions thereof, and although the Act vests the power of 
investigation in the provincial board and municipal or city council, it 
does not provide that the power or removal is in said bodies.  Hence, it
 cannot be argued that the subject as expressed in the title is not the 
same as that embodied in the body of the Act.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed and it is 
so ordered without costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
