				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by&nbsp; certiorari under Rule 46 of the&nbsp; Rules from a judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals which modified that of the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon in a partition&nbsp; suit&nbsp; (civil No.&nbsp; 120).<br><br>On September 1946 in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Sorsogon Gerarda&nbsp; Gamis&nbsp; and her&nbsp; husband&nbsp; Sebastian&nbsp; Imperial commenced suit against her father Victoriano Gamis arid brother Macario Gamis for partition&nbsp; of several parcels of land&nbsp; (A to C)&nbsp;&nbsp; claimed to be paraphernal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; late Ciriaca Giro,&nbsp; mother of the plaintiff&nbsp; Gerarda Gamis,&nbsp; and those numbered 1&nbsp; to 19, in the second amended complaint dated&nbsp; 4&nbsp; September&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp; to be&nbsp; conjugal of&nbsp; the spouses Victoriano Gamis&nbsp; and Ciriaca Giro.<br><br>After hearing, on&nbsp; 30 September 1954 the Court rendered judgment the dispositive part of which is as follows:<br><blockquote>Por tanto, el Juzgado declara las Parcelas A y B la porcion equivalente a 2/3 partes&nbsp; de la&nbsp; Parcela C&nbsp; como bienes&nbsp; parafernales de la finada&nbsp; Giriaca Giro que deben ser divididas en partes&nbsp; iguales entre la demandante Gerarda Gamis y&nbsp; el demandado Macario Gamis. En cuanto a las Parcelas&nbsp; 1 al 19, se declaran bienes de Ciriaca Giro y Victoriano Gamis las Parcelas 1 y 2,&nbsp; las porciones cubiertas por las hojas declaratorias Exhibits K-2 y K-3 de la Parcela 5, la Parcela 9, la&nbsp; porcion cubierta&nbsp; por la hoja declaratoria&nbsp; Exhibit 1-4 de la Parcela 10,&nbsp; y las&nbsp; Parcelas 11 y 19, y se ordena que las mismas sean adjudicadas y&nbsp; divididas en la forma&nbsp; siguiente:&nbsp; una&nbsp; mitad a favor&nbsp; del&nbsp; demandado Victoriano Gamis&nbsp; y&nbsp; la otra mitad en partes iguales entre la demandante Gerarda Gamis y el&nbsp; demandado Macario Gamis.&nbsp; Se condena al&nbsp; demandado Victoriano Gamis a pagar a la demandante la suma&nbsp; de P2,000.00 en concepto de dafios y perjuicios. SE SOBRESEE la demanda en cuanto a las Parcelas 3, 4,&nbsp; 6, 7,&nbsp; 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,&nbsp; 17 y 18.&nbsp; SE CONCEDE a las partes una plazo de treinta (30) dias para que presenten al&nbsp; Juzgado&nbsp; un proyecto de particidn de conformidad&nbsp; con esta decision&nbsp; en la inteligencia de que no hacerlo dentro de&nbsp; dicho plazo, el Juzgado nombrara, a petici6n de cualquiera de las partes, tres comisionados que verificaran la particion ordenada en la presente decision.<br><br>No se hace ningun pronunciamiento especial en cuanto a las costas. (pp. 85, 104-105, Rec. on&nbsp; App.)<br></blockquote>Victoriano&nbsp; Gamis&nbsp; appealed to the Court of Appeals and there&nbsp; assigned as committed&nbsp; by the trial&nbsp; court the following errors:<br><blockquote>1. The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred in nodding&nbsp; that parcels A,&nbsp; B and C, as described in the complaint, are paraphernal&nbsp; property of Ciriaca Giro,<br><br>2. The trial court erred in&nbsp; finding parcels 1,&nbsp; 2, 9,&nbsp; 11 and 19 as conjugal property of the spouses Victoriano Gamis and&nbsp; Ciriaca Giro.<br><br>3. The trial court erred in condemning appellant&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay plaintiff Gerarda Gamis&nbsp; two thousand pesos as damages.<br><br>4. The trial court erred in not declaring appellant forced heir of Ciriaca Giro, assuming that parcels A,&nbsp; B and C are her paraphernal property,<br></blockquote>On 11 April 1956 the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the lower court with a slight modification as to the remaining one-third&nbsp; undivided share of parcel of land lettered C, described in paragraph 3 of the second amended complaint,&nbsp; which was declared to belong to Gerarda Gamis and Macario Gamis share and&nbsp; share alike,&nbsp; said&nbsp; one-third undivided&nbsp; share having been inherited by them from their deceased&nbsp; uncle Anastacio&nbsp; Giro.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals the following&nbsp; pronouncement is made:<br><blockquote>Finally counsel for appellant contends that the lower court failed to declare appellant forced heir of Ciriaca Giro&nbsp; according to Article 834 of the old Civil Code which&nbsp; provides that&nbsp; a widower or widow who, on the death&nbsp; of his or her spouse is not divorced, or should be so by the fault of&nbsp; the deceased, shall be entitled to a portion in usufruct equal to that corresponding by way of legitime to each of the legitimate children or descendants who have not received any betterment. This is the&nbsp; first time this question is raised by appellant. He failed altogether to call the attention of the lower court to this&nbsp; question and hence it should&nbsp; be understood to have been waived according to a long line of decisions of our Supreme Court.&nbsp; Moreover, the lower court must have taken this fact into consideration&nbsp; when it awarded a nominal damage in the sum of&nbsp; P2,000 to the plaintiffs. (P. 13,&nbsp; Annex A.)<br></blockquote>A motion for reconsideration of the foregoing pronouncement was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; Hence this appeal by certiorari.<br><br>In&nbsp; his brief&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Victoriano&nbsp; Gamis&nbsp; assigns only&nbsp; one error&nbsp; as committed by the Court of&nbsp; Appeals, to wit:<br><blockquote>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in affirming the&nbsp; decision of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Sorsogon in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 120, in so far as it held that parcels A, B and C should be divided equally between Gerarda Gamis&nbsp; and Macario Gamis.<br></blockquote>And after&nbsp; making a short&nbsp; statement of facts under the heading "Discussion" contends thatâ€”<br><blockquote>* * * the Court of Appeals violated Article 834 of the Old Civil Code when&nbsp; it decided to partition equally between Gerarda&nbsp; Gamis and Macario Gamis Parcels A, B and C, ignoring altogether the usufructuary rights of petitioner Victoriano Gamis as surviving spouse of his deceased wife, Ciriaca Giro.<br></blockquote>In support of the contention he invoices article&nbsp; 834 of the old&nbsp; Civil Code,&nbsp; the law&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; because the&nbsp; deceased spouse&nbsp; died on 17 January 1909, which provides:<br><blockquote>A widower or&nbsp; widow who,&nbsp; on the death of his or her spouse, is not divorced, or should be so&nbsp; by the fault of the deceased, shall be entitled to apportion in usufruct equal to that^corresponding by way of legitime to each of the legitimate children or descendants who have not received any betterment.<br></blockquote>Under articles 807 and 834 of the old Civil Code the surviving spouse is a forced heir and entitled to a share in usufruct in the estate of the deceased spouse equal to&nbsp; that which by way&nbsp; of legitime corresponds or belongs to each of the&nbsp; legitimate children or&nbsp; descendants who&nbsp; have not been bettered or have not received&nbsp; any share in the&nbsp; one-third share destined for betterment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right of the surviving spouse to have a share in usufruct in the estate of the deceased spouse is&nbsp; provided&nbsp; by law of&nbsp; which such spouse cannot be deprived and which cannot&nbsp; be ignored. Of course, the&nbsp; spouse may waive it but the waiver must be express.<br><br>True, in his answer filed in the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon the petitioner&nbsp; did not claim that&nbsp; he was a forced heir as surviving spouse and as such entitled to a share in usufruct in the estate of his deceased&nbsp; wife, but the assertion of his usufructuary right as surviving spouse in the estate of his deceased wife would have&nbsp; been inconsistent with his&nbsp; claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; the parcels of land sought to be partitioned were not paraphernal, the main controversy being whether the&nbsp; parcels of land sought to be partitioned were paraphernal of the deceased first spouse, conjugal, exclusive of the surviving spouse, or conjugal of the surviving spouse with his&nbsp; deceased second wife and third wife.&nbsp; And after the Court of First Instance of Sorsogon had rendered its judgment that the first (A), second (B) and 2/3 of the third (C)&nbsp; parcels of land were paraphernal he lost no time in asserting his usufructuary right as surviving spouse in the estate of his deceased first wife and praying that he be&nbsp; so held and&nbsp; declared&nbsp; in his brief submitted to the Court of Appeals,&nbsp; without waiving his right to claim and contend that the parcels of land just referred to were not paraphernal&nbsp; of his deceased&nbsp; first wife but otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; the petitioner cannot be held to have&nbsp; waived his usufructuary right or share in usufruct as surviving spouse in the estate of his deceased wife Ciriaca Giro.<br><br>The judgment of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals under review is modified in the sense that under articles 807 and 834 of the old Civil Code&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; a share&nbsp; in usufruct in the estate of&nbsp; the late Ciriaca Giro, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
