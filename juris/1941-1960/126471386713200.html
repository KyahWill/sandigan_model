				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action to recover damages for  the institution, against  plaintiff-appellant, Ladislao  Palma,  of Criminal case No. V-2135 of the Court of First Instance of Cebu, for "frauds against the public treasury," which was dismissed,  and of  criminal  case No.  V-2763,  of the same court, for malversation of public funds, in which he was acquitted.  It is alleged in the complaint that the information  in said criminal cases were, on or about August 31 and September 26, 1950,  respectively, caused to be filed— through "malicious machination" and in "bad faith", as well as "without any probable cause" and "with the intention of harassing and embarrassing the plaintiff" and "to besmirch" his  "honor and reputation"—by defendant Manuel  Cuenco, then provincial  governor of Cebu who, it is said, acted, "with  evident  premeditation"  and  "due to personal hatred  and vengeance against plaintiff," in  connivance  with defendant Honorato Graciano, as  assistant fiscal of the City of Cebu,  and contrary to law.  Said City of Cebu and the province of Cebu were, likewise, included in the complaint as defendants.</p>
<p>In due  course, each one  of  the  aforementioned four defendants filed separate motions to dismiss, all based upon one and the same ground,  namely, "that the complaint states no cause of action".   By an  order of  August 12, 1953, the Court of  First  Instance of Cebu granted said motions and dismissed the complaint.  Hence, this  appeal by plaintiff Ladislao Palma.</p>
<p>The only question before us is whether or not plaintiff's complaint states a cause of action against any of  the four defendants  herein.</p>
<p>With respect to the province of Cebu and the City of Cebu, it is clear that the order appealed from is well-taken and must be upheld.  Indeed,  if as plaintiff avers  in his complaint,  the  acts therein set forth were performed by defendants Manuel Cuenco and Honorato Garciano, "contrary to law,"  it follows  that they bore neither the approval nor  the authority  of  said political  subdivisions, which, accordingly, cannot be held  liable therefor.  This exemption  from  responsibility  of the  province  of Cebu and the City  of  Cebu  becomes more evident when  we consider that said acts  (prosecution of crimes)  are, not corporate,  <em>but  governmental or political in character, and that, in the  discharge of functions  of  this nature, municipal corporations are  responsible  for  the acts  of its officers, except if and when,  and only  to the extent that they have acted by authority of the law, and in conformity with the requirements thereof</em> (Cooley, Municipal Corporations, 376; 38 Am. Jur. 299-300).  In fact,  section 5 of Commonwealth Act No. 58 (as amended), which is the Charter of the City of  Cebu, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'"The city shall not be liable or  held  for damages or injuries to persons or  property arising from the failure of the mayor, the municipal board, or any other city officer, to enforce the provisions of this charter, or any other law or ordinance, or from  negligence of said  mayor, municipal board, or other officers while enforcing or attempting to enforce said provisions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The situation varies,  fundamentally, as regards defendants Manuel Cuenco and Honorato  Graciano.  The order of dismissal complained of is predicated upon the theory that the filing of  the informations above referred to, is "presumed" to have been made "in good  faith" and that, in fact,  the proper  court had found the  existence  of probable cause against  plaintiff herein,  <em>contrary</em>  to the allegations in the complaint, which specifically charges "bad faith", lack  of "any probable cause", desire to give vent to "personal hatred and vengeance," and intent to harass and embarrass the plaintiff and  to besmirch  his  honor  and reputation.  The only question for determination  by the court,  at the time  of the issuance  of said order,  was whether or not the  complaint states  a cause of  action. This implied that said issue was to  be passed upon on the basis of the allegations of the complaint,  <em>assuming  them</em> <em>to be  true.</em>   Instead, his honor, the  trial judge inquired into the truth of said allegations and, in effect, found them to be  false.  And this  it did without giving  the plaintiff an opportunity to prove his aforesaid allegations.  Thus, the lower court had, not only exceeded its jurisdiction, by going beyond the purview of the issue posed by defendants' motions to dismiss, but, also, denied due process of law to plaintiff herein, by, in effect deciding the case on the merits, before it had been submitted for decision and before plaintiff had had a chance to introduce evidence  in  support of the allegations of his complaint.</p>
<p>Upon the  other  hand, it is impliedly conceded  that a cause  of  action would  exist  against defendants  Manuel Cuenco and  Honorato  Graciano, if said allegations were taken  on  their  face value.   <em>In this connection, it is well settled that  when a public  officer  goes  outside the scope of his  duty,  particularly  when acting tortiously, he is not entitled to protection on  account of his office, but is liable for his acts  like any  private individual </em>(46 C. J.  1046; 22  R.  C. L. 478-479).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed as regards,  only, the  province of Cebu and the City of Cebu, and it is reversed as to defendants Manuel Cuenco and Honorato Graciano, and  let the  record be remanded to the lower court  for  further  proceedings, insofar  as  the last two defendants are  concerned, without  special pronouncement as to costs.  It is  so  ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon, Padillla, Montemayor,  Reyes, A., Jugo,  Bautista  Angelo, Labrador,  Reyes, J. B.  L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
