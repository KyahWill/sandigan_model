				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On&nbsp; 3&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; Angelina&nbsp; F.&nbsp; de&nbsp; Lopez, Pacita F. de Villavicencio and Corazon F. del Castillo, children of the late&nbsp; Jacobo&nbsp; Fajardo&nbsp; y Puno, filed a&nbsp; petition in the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila in&nbsp; Special&nbsp; Proceedings No. 59819,&nbsp; alleging that, pursuant to an agreement dated&nbsp; 18&nbsp; November 1952,&nbsp; as amended&nbsp; by another dated&nbsp; 30&nbsp; September&nbsp; 1953, entered into by&nbsp; and&nbsp; between the&nbsp; widow&nbsp; and heirs of the&nbsp; deceased,&nbsp; they agreed to subdivide into&nbsp; several&nbsp; lots the&nbsp; parcel of land covered by transfer certificate of title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 352&nbsp; and&nbsp; the parcel of land leased by the deceased in&nbsp; his&nbsp; lifetime from the Government, all situate in the province of Cotabato,&nbsp; and adjudicate the lots thus subdivided to the groups of heirs; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; arrive&nbsp; at a&nbsp; fair distribution of&nbsp; the estate, a&nbsp; committee&nbsp; to appraise the value of the&nbsp; share adjudicated&nbsp; to&nbsp; each&nbsp; group of&nbsp; heirs was formed;&nbsp; that the committee formed was composed of&nbsp; Demetrio Fajardo, representing the first group of heirs, and Lucio R.&nbsp; Ildefonso, representing the second group of&nbsp; heirs;&nbsp; that the parties agreed&nbsp; further that in&nbsp; case of&nbsp;&nbsp; conflict in&nbsp; the reports of the&nbsp; two members, Edgardo&nbsp; Villavicencio shall submit a&nbsp; report on&nbsp; the value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lots as appraised by him and his report shall&nbsp; be final&nbsp; and binding upon the parties; that as&nbsp; the two members&nbsp; of the committee submitted different and conflicting reports, Edgardo&nbsp; Villavicencio submitted his own report on 6 September 1954; that in this report the widow Antonia J. Vda. de Fajardo, who is&nbsp; the administratrix&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate, is&nbsp; called upon to pay to the petitioners the sum of P44,539.68, to settle the&nbsp; difference&nbsp; in&nbsp; value&nbsp; between the&nbsp; share&nbsp; adjudicated to the former and&nbsp; the latter;&nbsp; and that all the heirs&nbsp; are about to register the&nbsp; two agreements mentioned&nbsp; and to secure the corresponding certificates&nbsp; of&nbsp; title&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; respective parcels of&nbsp; land adjudicated to them.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; the foregoing allegations the petitioners prayed that the probate court direct the&nbsp; Registrar of Deeds in&nbsp; and for&nbsp; the province of&nbsp; Cotabato&nbsp; to annotate on the transfer certificate of title to be issued to Antonia J.&nbsp; Vda.&nbsp; de Fajardo for&nbsp; the&nbsp; lots adjudicated to her&nbsp; her&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; to pay the&nbsp; sum of P44,539.68 due&nbsp; and owing to the&nbsp; petitioners.<br><br>On 12 November 1954 the&nbsp; administratrix&nbsp; objected to the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to annotate&nbsp; the&nbsp; lien on the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; the sum of P44,539.68&nbsp;&nbsp; awarded to&nbsp; the petitioners has&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; been&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; and for that&nbsp; reason the order to annotate&nbsp; the lien&nbsp; would be&nbsp; premature; that the sum&nbsp; of P44,539.68&nbsp; awarded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the petitioners&nbsp; is unreasonable because&nbsp; the coconut trees planted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; owned by&nbsp; the deceased&nbsp; are given&nbsp; the same valuation&nbsp; as&nbsp; those planted in the parcel of land leased from the Government; that&nbsp; the administratrix has&nbsp; a claim still unpaid in the sum of P3,631.76 against each&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioners which may&nbsp; be set&nbsp; off&nbsp; partially against&nbsp; the sum of P44,539.68; that the administratrix has&nbsp; made&nbsp; certain&nbsp; advances reimbursible by the heirs which&nbsp; may&nbsp; also be set off partially against the&nbsp; sum claimed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; due them;&nbsp; that in the project&nbsp; of partition dated&nbsp; 24&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1952&nbsp; already approved by the Court, the petitioner Angelina F. de Lopez is required to pay the&nbsp; estate of the deceased Abelardo Fajardo&nbsp; the sum of P2,018.40, but&nbsp; the said sum still remains unpaid; and&nbsp; that the report submitted by Edgardo&nbsp; Villavicencio has&nbsp; not yet been approved&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Court.<br><br>On&nbsp; 12&nbsp; January&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; reply to the&nbsp; opposition alleging&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; report&nbsp; of&nbsp; Edgardo Villaviceneio was submitted&nbsp; in compliance with the agreement entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; by the&nbsp; heirs duly&nbsp; approved by&nbsp; the Court on 10 October 1953; that in accordance with article 2044 of the new Civil Code, the report need not be&nbsp; approved&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Court to bind the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; therein; that granting that&nbsp; the sum of P44.539.68 awarded to the petitioners is unreasonable, the objection thereto is not well taken,&nbsp; because unreasonableness is&nbsp; not a&nbsp; ground upon which the validity of the report may be assailed pursuant to article 2038 of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Code; that the administratrix has&nbsp; waived her&nbsp; right to collect from each&nbsp; of the heirs the&nbsp; sum of P3,631.76; that even&nbsp; if&nbsp; there&nbsp; is a sum of money&nbsp; due the estate&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Abelardo Fajardo from petitioners&nbsp; Angelina F.&nbsp; de Lopez, the&nbsp; same&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; set&nbsp; up&nbsp; as&nbsp; ground to object to the&nbsp; report filed&nbsp; by Edgardo&nbsp; Villaviceneio because the&nbsp; creditor&nbsp; is&nbsp; a different estate; and that if&nbsp; any sum of&nbsp; money is due the&nbsp; estate of the&nbsp; late Abelardo&nbsp; Fajardo from the petitioners, their individual&nbsp; liability&nbsp; does&nbsp; not exceed P672.80&nbsp; which they are&nbsp; willing to pay&nbsp; to the&nbsp; said estate.<br><br>On 28 January&nbsp; 1955 the Court issued an&nbsp; order,&nbsp; the dispositive part&nbsp; of&nbsp; which provides:<br><blockquote>Premises considered this Court finds' that the report of Edgardo Villavicencio&nbsp; in question does not require judicial approval in&nbsp; view of the terms of the&nbsp; agreement above quoted, and that the unreasonableness of the amount awarded&nbsp; is not one of the grounds provided for by law to contest the award or decision of an arbitrator.<br><br>However,&nbsp; it appearing' that&nbsp; there are&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; allegedly&nbsp; due and&nbsp; payable to&nbsp; the oppositor from&nbsp; each of the movants,&nbsp; and in order to avoid multiplicity of incidents&nbsp; and actions, this Court is of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that&nbsp; the matter&nbsp; should be&nbsp; set for&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; as it is&nbsp; hereby set for hearing; on February 17, 1955, at 8:30&nbsp; a.m., for the&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; adjusting respective&nbsp; claims of the movants and the&nbsp; oppositor indicated&nbsp; above.<br></blockquote>On 9&nbsp; March 1955,&nbsp; acting upon&nbsp; the various&nbsp; pleadings filed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; motion for reconsideration, reply&nbsp; thereto, rejoinder to reply, and opposition&nbsp; to the rejoinder, the Court issued an order denying the&nbsp; motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The administratrix has appealed.<br><br>The aforequoted dispositive part&nbsp; of the order&nbsp; of the probate&nbsp; court appealed from holds in&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; the rejiort of Edgardo Villavicencio is final and binding upon the parties and&nbsp; that the sum of P44,539.68&nbsp; is&nbsp; due and payable by the administratrix to the petitioners.<br><br>The appellant contends that the said report is&nbsp; not final and binding upon&nbsp; the parties; that&nbsp; it must be&nbsp; approved by the Court to&nbsp; be so;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; that&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; stipulating&nbsp; that&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the arbitrator&nbsp; is final,&nbsp; is&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; public&nbsp; policy,&nbsp; for it deprives the courts of&nbsp; jurisdiction, and for that reason null and void. The appellees, on the other hand,&nbsp; invoke article 2044&nbsp; of the new Civil Code which provides that "Any stipulation that&nbsp; the&nbsp; arbitrators'&nbsp; award or&nbsp; decision shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; final, is valid *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."<br><br>Paragraphs&nbsp; 7&nbsp; and&nbsp; 8&nbsp; of&nbsp; the agreement entered&nbsp; into by and between&nbsp; the parties on&nbsp; 18&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1952, as amended by another on 30 September&nbsp; 1953, provide:<br><blockquote>7.<sup>o</sup>â€”Para&nbsp; la&nbsp; igualacion&nbsp; de Yalores&nbsp; tanto&nbsp; del terreno corno&nbsp; de sus mejoras y&nbsp; plantacioncs, queda&nbsp; constituido&nbsp; un comite&nbsp; de dos micmbros, o sea: uno&nbsp; por parte de la viuda, hijo y nietos (primer grupo)&nbsp; y otro por parte de&nbsp; las trcs hijas&nbsp; (segvmdo grupo).&nbsp; Para el primer grupo&nbsp; queda nombrado el heredero Dn. Demetrio Fajardo y para el segundo grupo, Dn. Lucio Ildefonso;<br><br>8<sup>o</sup>â€”En caso de desaeuerdo en&nbsp; su actuacion entre los dos comsionadoa, actuara como arbitro Edgardo&nbsp; Villavicencio, euya decision sera decisiva y final.<br></blockquote>Nowhere in the&nbsp; aforequoted&nbsp; stipulations of&nbsp; the agreement,&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp; is the arbitrator empowered to award. to any heir the&nbsp; sum of money&nbsp; he did&nbsp; award to&nbsp; the petitioners.&nbsp; The&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; in&nbsp; forming the&nbsp; committee of two was to appraise the value of the estate&nbsp; as a step leading to its&nbsp; just and&nbsp; fair&nbsp; partition&nbsp; among&nbsp; the heirs. At most that part of the report of the&nbsp; arbitrator awarding&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioners the sum of P44,539.68&nbsp; as due&nbsp; from&nbsp; the administratrix,&nbsp; would&nbsp; merely&nbsp; be recommendatory but&nbsp; could&nbsp; not be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; final and&nbsp; binding upon the administratrix.&nbsp; What is final and binding upon the&nbsp; parties is that part&nbsp; of the report&nbsp; appraising&nbsp; the subdivided parcels of&nbsp; land and&nbsp; improvements&nbsp; thereon. Section 24(d), Republic Act No. 876, known as the Arbitration Law,&nbsp; which took effect&nbsp; on 19&nbsp; December&nbsp; 1953, and&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; retroactively applied to the case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar because&nbsp; it&nbsp; is procedural in&nbsp; character,&nbsp; provides that&nbsp; the court may vacate&nbsp; an&nbsp; award of an&nbsp; arbitrator when he has&nbsp; exceeded&nbsp; his powers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The probate&nbsp; court in effect awards to the petitioners the sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P44,539.68 as due from the administratrix upon the&nbsp; ground "that the report of Edgardo Villavicencio&nbsp; in question&nbsp; does not&nbsp; require judicial approval in view of the terms of the agreement above quoted, and that the unreasonableness of the amount awarded is not&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the grounds&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; by law&nbsp; to&nbsp; contest the award or decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; arbitrator." As&nbsp; already&nbsp; adverted to,&nbsp; this&nbsp; is&nbsp; an error, because the agreement entered&nbsp; into by&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; does not give the arbitrator the power to do&nbsp; so.<br><br>The order&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; in&nbsp; so far&nbsp; as it holds "that the&nbsp; report&nbsp; of Edgardo&nbsp; Villavicencio&nbsp; in question&nbsp; does not&nbsp; require judicial approval&nbsp; in&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; terms of the agreement above quoted, and that the unreasonableness of the amount awarded is not one of the grounds provided for&nbsp; by law&nbsp; to&nbsp; contest&nbsp; the award&nbsp; or&nbsp; decision of an arbitrator,"&nbsp; is&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside.&nbsp; Let&nbsp; the&nbsp; probate court proceed with&nbsp; the hearing of the case "for the&nbsp; purpose of adjusting the respective&nbsp; claims&nbsp; of&nbsp; the movants&nbsp; and the&nbsp; oppositor indicated&nbsp; above," without&nbsp; pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.</i>, and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.<br></div>
