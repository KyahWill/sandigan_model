				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Teodoro Yuzon&nbsp; <i>alias</i> Yallejo, together&nbsp; with four&nbsp; other defendants&nbsp; whose&nbsp; names&nbsp; and whereabouts were unknown, was.charged in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga with&nbsp; the&nbsp; complex crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; kidnapping with&nbsp; murder&nbsp; of Francisco&nbsp; Pineda&nbsp; and Quintin Pineda&nbsp; in two separate informations&nbsp; (crim. cases&nbsp; Nos. 2041&nbsp; and 2041-A).&nbsp;&nbsp; The information in the first case, where the victim is Francisco Pineda, is couched in the following terms:<br><blockquote>That on&nbsp; or about the 19th&nbsp; day&nbsp; of May, 1951., at sitio Bisucul of barrio Irong, municipality of&nbsp; Mabalacat,&nbsp; province of Pampanga, Philippines," and&nbsp; within the jurisdiction of this&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Court, the said accused being then private individuals and known members of the HUK organization, all armed with firearms, conspiring and confederating together and all&nbsp; helping one&nbsp; another,&nbsp; did then and there willfully, unlawfully and&nbsp; feloniously, and for the purpose&nbsp; of killing one Francisco Pineda as a suspected government spy, kidnap, carry away, detain, and later, after, having&nbsp; taken him to an uninhabited place in barrio Malamon, Magalang, Pampanga, with treachery,&nbsp; to wit: while the said Francisco&nbsp; Pineda. was deprived&nbsp; of&nbsp; his liberty, with his two hands tied&nbsp; behind his back and way very weak as a result&nbsp; of the physical injuries which had been previously&nbsp; inflicted upon him&nbsp; by the said accused,&nbsp; stabbed&nbsp; him in the vital parts&nbsp; of his body with a bayonet, thereby inflicting upon him&nbsp; physical injuries which caused directly&nbsp; the death&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Francisco Pineda.</blockquote>The information in the&nbsp; second case,&nbsp; where the victim&nbsp; is Quintin Pineda, is&nbsp; couched&nbsp; in similar&nbsp; terms.<br><br>Before arraignment Teodoro Yuzon&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; quash the informations in the two cases on the ground that he had been&nbsp; previously convicted&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime of&nbsp; rebellion and sentenced&nbsp; to suffer 1 year, 1 month and 10 days&nbsp; of <i>prision correcional</i> by the Court of First Instance of Tarlac (crim. case No.&nbsp; 985), after withdrawing his plea&nbsp; of not guilty to the original&nbsp; information for&nbsp; rebellion with&nbsp; murder, robbery, arson and kidnapping and entering one of guilty to the crime of rebellion&nbsp; under the&nbsp; provisions of section 4, Rule 114.<br><br>The prosecution objected to the motion to quash contending that the crime with which the defendant was charged did&nbsp; not place&nbsp; him&nbsp; in danger of being&nbsp; convicted of&nbsp; the same offense for which he&nbsp; had&nbsp; been previously&nbsp; convicted and&nbsp; sentenced, as there is&nbsp; neither identity&nbsp; nor similarity between the&nbsp; complex crime&nbsp; of&nbsp; kidnapping" with&nbsp; murder and&nbsp; that&nbsp; of&nbsp; rebellion;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the crime of&nbsp; rebellion&nbsp; does not necessarily include&nbsp; or is necessarily included&nbsp; in&nbsp; that of murder, arson,&nbsp; kidnapping&nbsp; or robbery; and that&nbsp; the offense with which&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant is&nbsp; charged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; cases at bar&nbsp; was not included&nbsp; nor charged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; information filed in criminal case No. 985 of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac.<br><br>The Court&nbsp; heldâ€”<br><br>* * * that when the accused&nbsp; pleaded&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; and was&nbsp; sentenced by Judge Hilario in Criminal Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 985 of&nbsp;&nbsp; the amended information upon which he&nbsp; was re-arraigned and finally convicted&nbsp; necessarily included the offenses&nbsp; of kidnapping1&nbsp; with&nbsp; murder&nbsp; embodied in the informations in&nbsp; Criminal Cases Nos, 2041&nbsp; and 2041-A&nbsp; tmd&nbsp; that, therefore, if such informations&nbsp; were&nbsp; allowed to&nbsp; stand, the accused would be in danger of being- tried and/or convicted&nbsp; again of the same offense.&nbsp; The&nbsp; ground of double jeopardy&nbsp; is well&nbsp; founded, and&nbsp; granted the motion to quash.&nbsp; The State appeals.<br><br>In&nbsp; his&nbsp; brief the&nbsp; Solicitor General quotes&nbsp; from&nbsp; the transcript part of the&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; had&nbsp; in criminal&nbsp; case No.&nbsp; 985 of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Tarlac which is as follows:<br><br>If&nbsp; your Honor, pleases:&nbsp; The Army Screening Board has recommended that the accused in these&nbsp; cases can plead guilty to the lesser crime of <i>simple rebellion</i>,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; honest and sincere belief&nbsp; that these accused can be redeemed and return, once more&nbsp; to the democratic "ways of life.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; if your Honor, please&nbsp; some of the accused have already been in&nbsp; jail for more than two years, and to continue the prosecution of these&nbsp; cases for the complex crime will mean&nbsp; the presentation&nbsp; of mere&nbsp; than 200&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; in&nbsp; each&nbsp; case. In the case of Layug, we agree to his pleading to&nbsp; the simple: crime of rebellion with <i>reservation</i> to&nbsp; prosecute&nbsp; him further&nbsp; for other crimes&nbsp; as the evidence&nbsp; may warrant taking- into consideration the recommendation of the Screening Board.&nbsp; In this connection, therefore, all allegations in&nbsp; the information for the complex crime of rebellion are hereby discarded and only allegations for the crime of simple rebellion as member or executor shall remain as subsisting in the&nbsp; information.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Assistant&nbsp; Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; Fernando Bartolome speaking; p. 80, record.)<br><br>The record&nbsp; of criminal&nbsp; case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 985&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Tarlac is not before this Court.&nbsp; Attorney for the appellee does not,&nbsp; however, dispute the correctness of the&nbsp; quotation made&nbsp; by the Solicitor General.<br><br>Counsel for the State contends that all the allegations in the information filed in that&nbsp; case constituting the complex crime&nbsp; of rebellion with&nbsp; murder, arson,&nbsp; kidnapping and robbery&nbsp; were&nbsp; discarded&nbsp; or striken out&nbsp; and&nbsp; only the allegations&nbsp; constituting&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of simple rebellion remained subsisting in the amended information.&nbsp; The&nbsp; statement of the&nbsp; prosecuting attorney in that case was to the effect that while he agreed to the entry by the defendant of a plea of guilty to the crime of simple rebellion, he reserved&nbsp; his&nbsp; right to&nbsp; prosecute the defendant for&nbsp; other crimes committed by him which the evidence might war- rant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the appellee contends&nbsp; only that&nbsp; the statement made by the prosecuting&nbsp; attorney above quoted did not amount to or constitute a further amendment of the amended information,&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; intended&nbsp; perhaps&nbsp; by&nbsp; the prosecuting attorney,&nbsp; because there was&nbsp; no such&nbsp; further amendment;&nbsp; that&nbsp; by entering a plea of guilty for a less serious&nbsp; offense&nbsp; included in&nbsp; the&nbsp; amended&nbsp; information&nbsp; the defendant was convicted and sentenced for the less serious offense&nbsp; under the unamended amended information; and that because there was&nbsp; no further&nbsp; amendment to&nbsp; the amended information, the defendant did not waive his right to plead&nbsp; double jeopardy&nbsp; in subsequent&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; for crimes included in the information filed in the previous case where he entered a plea of guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Solicitor General, on the other&nbsp; hand, claims that "by consenting to dismissal, accussed had waived&nbsp; his constitutional right" to&nbsp; be placed&nbsp; twice in jeopardy for the same offense, as such right may be waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup><br><br>But even&nbsp; without an amendment to the amended information&nbsp; filed in criminal case No. 985 of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Tarlac,&nbsp; which amendment would have excluded other crimes alleged therein&nbsp; except&nbsp; that&nbsp; of&nbsp; rebellion, and granting:&nbsp; that there had been no&nbsp; waiver on the part of the defendant of his right not to be prosecuted for crimes included in the crime for which he had been prosecuted,&nbsp; convicted and sentenced,&nbsp; still in the information filed&nbsp; in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Tarlac there is no specific&nbsp; reference&nbsp; either to the&nbsp; date stated in the informations filed in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga or&nbsp; mention of the names&nbsp; of Francisco&nbsp; Pineda and Quintin Pineda.&nbsp; The&nbsp; only allegation in the informations filed in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Pampanga&nbsp; which might involve&nbsp; or include the death&nbsp; of Francisco Pineda and Quintin Pineda in the crime of rebellion for which the appellee had been prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Tarlac are the&nbsp; following:&nbsp; "the&nbsp; said&nbsp; accused&nbsp; being then private individuals and known members of the HUK organization * *&nbsp; *&nbsp; did then&nbsp; and there willfully, unlawfully and&nbsp; feloniously, and&nbsp; for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; killing" one Francisco Pineda as a&nbsp; suspected government&nbsp; spy, kidnap,&nbsp; carry away,&nbsp; detain, etc."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; term&nbsp; "known members&nbsp; or the HUK organization" may be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; descriptive of the appellee and his&nbsp; companions who are still at&nbsp; large;&nbsp; and although the term used&nbsp; in the&nbsp; information "as a suspected government spy" may reveal&nbsp; by inference the motive&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crime, still&nbsp; as there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; evidence to&nbsp; show that&nbsp; the murder committed in this&nbsp; case was in furtherance of the&nbsp; rebellion&nbsp; movement, the&nbsp; dismissal of the information was rather&nbsp; premature and unwarranted. If it be shown by the evidence that the murders committed by the appellee and his four other companions were linked to and were&nbsp; in furtherance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; rebellion,&nbsp; then the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; would be&nbsp; justified in applying the&nbsp; rule&nbsp; laid down in the cases of People vs. Hernandez, 99 Phil.,&nbsp; 515, 52 Off. Gaz. 5506&nbsp; and People vs. Geronimo, 100&nbsp; Phil., 90, 53 Off. Gaz., 68.<br><br>The appellee not having entered a plea to the informations filed in&nbsp; these&nbsp; cases, the appeal by the:&nbsp; State&nbsp; from the order quashing the informations and the trial of the appellee to determine whether the crime committed by him was in connection&nbsp; with&nbsp; or in&nbsp; furtherance&nbsp; of the rebellion&nbsp; movement&nbsp; do not and cannot&nbsp; constitute double jeopardy.<br><br>The&nbsp; order appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; set aside and the&nbsp; cases remanded&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance from whence they came for further proceedings in accordance&nbsp; with law, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Montemayor, J., </i>concurs in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><center><b><i>DISSENTING OPINION</i></b></center><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes, J. B. L</span>. ;<br><br>I regret to differ from the opinion of the majority.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is conceded that&nbsp; having been already&nbsp; accused and&nbsp; convicted " in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Tarlac for the crime&nbsp; of rebellion, the&nbsp; appellant may not be&nbsp; tried again for the same&nbsp; crime or for any act&nbsp; absorbed&nbsp; in that&nbsp; of rebellion without infringing the&nbsp; constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.&nbsp; The reservation made by the prosecution in the Tarlac case,&nbsp; quoted in the majority opinion, was&nbsp; one "to&nbsp; prosecute&nbsp; him <i>for&nbsp; other&nbsp; crimes</i>;" hence it did not retain&nbsp; the privilege of prosecuting appellant&nbsp; again for&nbsp; rebellion or any&nbsp; of its component acts, even granting that&nbsp; such right could have&nbsp; been reserved.<br><br>In the present case, appellant and his co-accused "being known members of the Huk organization", are charged with killing "one Francisco Pineda as a suspected government spy".&nbsp;&nbsp; Descriptive or not, these words plainly charge&nbsp; an act of rebellion, since it is a matter of public knowledge, of which we can take judicial notice, that the Huk organization has rebelled and still is against the government; and it is not denied that the killing of government spies (actual or suspected) is an act in furtherance of the objective to overthrow the government.&nbsp; Hence it is clear, right now, that the crime charged&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga was an act included in the&nbsp; charge of&nbsp; rebellion in the Court of Tarlac to which the appellant has pleaded guilty and for which he has&nbsp; already been sentenced.<br><br>It is idle to speculate&nbsp; that the Fiscal <i>may</i> have intended to charge&nbsp; appellant with a&nbsp; private crime, a&nbsp; killing done with personal motives and not&nbsp; in&nbsp; furtherance of political objectives.&nbsp; If any such intention existed, why should&nbsp; the prosecuting attorney insert in the information the phrases "being known members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Huk&nbsp; organization" and "killing&nbsp; one Francisco Pineda as a suspected government spy"?&nbsp;&nbsp; These words have no relevancy whatever,in a case of ordinary murder;&nbsp; on the other hand, they constitute an admission&nbsp; of the political motivation behind the killing' and&nbsp; would&nbsp; bind&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial&nbsp; now ordered would&nbsp; thus seem to&nbsp; be pure&nbsp; ceremony.<br><br>To prolong&nbsp; appellant's detention and&nbsp; his' uncertainty concerning his&nbsp; fate&nbsp; until the&nbsp; political character of the offense charged is further evidenced, when it is so apparent on the face of&nbsp; the&nbsp; information is, I&nbsp; submit, a&nbsp; violation of the&nbsp; well established rule that doubts should be resolved in favor of the accused. The judgment of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of. First Instance is correct and" should be sustained.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Reyes, A., Conception</i>, and <i>Reyes,&nbsp; J.
