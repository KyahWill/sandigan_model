				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action to&nbsp; recover the amount of P1,800&nbsp; as damages and the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P200&nbsp; as&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees filed before&nbsp; the Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of the City of Manila. Defendants are Benito Macrohon,&nbsp; Sheriff of Quezon City, and two corporations organized under the laws&nbsp; of the Philippines.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the complaint are attached copies of two annexes on which the action is based&nbsp; and which contain the alleged conditional&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in favor of plaintiff&nbsp; of the properties mentioned in the complaint.<br><br>The complaint alleges that plaintiff is entitled to the possession&nbsp; and ownership&nbsp; of certain&nbsp; personal&nbsp; properties listed therein&nbsp; by virtue of a conditional&nbsp; sale executed by Catalina de Leon and Leuterio&nbsp; Limcaco, copies of which are Annexes A and A-1; that on August 23, 1956, defendants,&nbsp; conspiring together, levied upon said&nbsp; properties and sold them&nbsp; at&nbsp; public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; in spite of the third-party complaint filed by&nbsp; plaintiff with sheriff Macrohon; that the sale was&nbsp; carried out in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; an indemnity&nbsp; bond executed in behalf of said sheriff&nbsp; by his&nbsp; co-defendants binding themselves to indemnify him&nbsp; for the damages he may suffer&nbsp; as a consequence of the sale; that because of the sale of the properties as&nbsp; (above-mentioned, plaintiff suffered damages in&nbsp; the amount of&nbsp; P1,800. <br><br>One of the&nbsp; defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground&nbsp; that the complaint&nbsp; fails&nbsp; to state a cause of action, and despite the opposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; the same was granted, the court dismissing the complaint without costs.&nbsp; When the&nbsp; case&nbsp; was taken to the court&nbsp; of&nbsp; first instance on appeal, the&nbsp; same motion to dismiss was reiterated by defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff again opposed this motion, but despite its&nbsp; opposition, the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; again dismissed the case for the&nbsp; same reason that it fails to state a cause of action against defendants.&nbsp; This appeal was taken to us for the reason that only questions of law are involved. <br><br>We find no&nbsp; merit in the appeal.&nbsp; The complaint alleges that plaintiff&nbsp; is the owner of certain personal&nbsp; properties listed therein by virtue of certain conditional sale executed by&nbsp; Catalina de Leon and Leuterio Limcaco in&nbsp; its favor, and in&nbsp; reliance&nbsp; thereon it invokes two&nbsp; agreement which are embodied&nbsp; in Annexes A and A-l.&nbsp; And because said properties&nbsp; were levied&nbsp; upon&nbsp; and sold at public&nbsp; auction by&nbsp; defendants despite the third-party complaint&nbsp; it had filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the sheriff,&nbsp; plaintiff claims&nbsp; that it suffered damages in the amount&nbsp; of P1,800.&nbsp; It now seeks&nbsp; to collect said&nbsp; damages&nbsp; under the indemnity&nbsp; bond executed in favor of the sheriff by his&nbsp; co-defendants.&nbsp; It&nbsp; turned out however, as found by the trial court, that said agreements do not represent any conditional sale of the properties claimed by the plaintiff but merely refer to a chattel mortgage or pledge coving properties which are distinct and different from those listed in the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; If from the very fact of&nbsp; the complaint, as supplemented by&nbsp; its annexes, plaintiff&nbsp; is&nbsp; not the&nbsp; owner,&nbsp; nor entitled to the properties it claims to have been levied&nbsp; upon and sold at public auction&nbsp; by the defendants and for which&nbsp; it now seeks indemnity, it is evident that the complaint does not give plaintiff any right of action against defendants.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; therefore acted properly in dismissing the complaint.<br><br>But it is claimed that the trial court erred in considering the annexes in acting on the motion to dismiss for it could have&nbsp; merely confined its scrutiny to the&nbsp; allegations of the complaint for if the&nbsp; latter were&nbsp; considered independently of&nbsp; those annexes&nbsp; we would find that the plaintiff has a good&nbsp; cause&nbsp; of action because&nbsp; it is alleged therein that it is the owner of the articles which were improvidently sold by&nbsp; defendants to its prejudice.&nbsp; This pretense is untenable for one cannot separate the complaint&nbsp; from its annexes since it clearly&nbsp; appears in said complaint that the claim of&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; to be&nbsp; the owner of the properties in question is predicated on said annexes&nbsp; which are&nbsp; alleged to contain agreements&nbsp; of conditional&nbsp; sale. However, such claim was found to be untrue&nbsp; for as already stated said annexes merely embody a&nbsp; contract of&nbsp; chattel&nbsp; mortgage or pledge of properties distinct and different from those listed in the complaint.<br><br>It&nbsp; is likewise&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; that the&nbsp; lower court erred&nbsp; in dismissing the&nbsp; complaint outright for it could have merely ordered plaintiff to amend the same&nbsp; to&nbsp; make it conform to the contents of the annexes or otherwise reconcile the discrepancies, if any, and require defendants&nbsp; to answer the complaint as&nbsp; held by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme Court in the case of&nbsp; World Wide Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc. <i>vs.</i> Gonzalo L.&nbsp; Manuel,&nbsp; 98 Phil., 46;&nbsp; 51&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp;&nbsp; [12] 6214.&nbsp; This claim is also untenable for it would be futile to make the complaint conform to what appears in the annexes because the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; embody&nbsp; merely&nbsp; certain&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; of chattel mortgage or pledge which would at most give plaintiff a lien on the properties in question.&nbsp; But the great flaw we find in this claim lies in the fact that&nbsp; said annexes refer to properties which are different from those listed in the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case above alluded to is inapplicable for if in that case the complaint and the document annexed thereto were reconciled&nbsp; it was because the alleged discrepancy appears explained in the very body of the complaint. <br><br>Wherefore, the order&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
