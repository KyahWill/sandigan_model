				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. NICASIO YATCO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, QUEZON CITY BRANCH, AND JUAN CONSUNJI AND ALFONSO PANGANIBAN, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In an amended information filed by the City Attorney of Quezon City on March 
22, 1955, Juan Consunji, Alfonso Panganiban, and another whose identity is still 
unknown, were charged with having conspired together in the murder of one Jose 
Ramos (Criminal Case No. Q-1G37 of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City). 
Trial of the case started on May 3, 1955, and in several hearings the 
prosecution had been presenting its evidence. During the progress of the trial 
on May 18, 1955, while the prosecution was questioning one of its witnesses, 
Atty. Arturo Xavier of the National Bureau of Investigation, in connection with 
the making of a certain extra-judicial confession (allegedly made before him) by 
defendant Juan Consunji to the witness, counsel for the other defendant Alfonso 
Panganiban interposed a general objection to any evidence on such confession on 
the ground that it was hearsay and therefore incompetent as against the other 
accused Panganiban. The Court below ordered the exclusion of the evidence 
objected to, but on an altogether different ground: that the prosecution could 
not be permitted to introduce the confessions of defendants Juan Consunji and 
Alfonso Panganiban to prove conspiracy between them, without prior proof of such 
conspiracy by a number of definite acts, conditions, and circumstances. 
Thereafter, according to the transcript, the following remarks were made:
<blockquote>
<p>"Fiscal Lustre:</p>
<p>May we know from counsel if he is also objecting to the admissibility of the 
confession of Consunji as against the accused Consunji himself?</p>
<p>Court:</p>
<p>That would be premature because there is already a ruling of the Court that 
you cannot prove a confession unless you prove first conspiracy thru a number of 
indefinite acts, conditions and circumstances as required by law." Annex "B" of 
the petition, p. 9</p></blockquote>
<p>The prosecution then moved in writing for a reconsideration of the order of 
exclusion, but again the motion was denied. Wherefore, this petition for 
certiorari was brought before this Court by the Solicitor General, for the 
review and annulment of the lower Court's order completely excluding any 
evidence on the extra judicial confessions of the accused Juan Consunji and 
Alfonso Panganiban without prior proof of conspiracy.</p>
<p>We believe that the lower Court committed a grave abuse of discretion in 
ordering the complete exclusion of the prosecution's evidence on the alleged 
confessions of the accused Juan Consunji at the stage of the trial when the 
ruling was made.</p>
<p>Section 14, Rule 123, Hules of Court, is specific as to the admissibility of 
the extrajudicial confession of an accused, freely and voluntarily made, as 
evidence against him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 14. Confession.—The declaration of an accused expressly acknowledging 
the truth of his guilt as to the offense charged, may be given in evidence 
against him."</p></blockquote>
<p>Under the rule of multiple admissibility of evidence, even if Consunji's 
confession may not be competent as against his co-accused Panganiban, being 
hearsay as to the latter, or to prove conspiracy between them without the 
conspiracy being established by other evidence, the confession of Consunji was, 
nevertheless, admissible as evidence of the declarant's own guilt (U. S. 
<em>vs</em>. Vega, 43 Phil. 41; People <em>vs</em>. Bande, 50 Phil. 37; People 
<em>vs</em>. Buan, 64 Phil. 296), and should have been admitted as such.</p>
<p>The rule cited by the Court below in support of its exclusion of the 
proffered evidence is Sec. 12 of Rule 123, providing that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The act or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy and 
during its existence may be given in evidence against the co-conspirator after 
the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such act or 
declaration."</p></blockquote>
<p>Manifestly, the rule refers to statements made by one conspirator <em>during 
the pendency of the unlawful enterprises</em> (''<em>during its existence</em>") 
and in furtherance of its object, and not to a confession made, as in this case, 
long after the conspiracy had been brought to an end (U. S. <em>vs</em>. 
Empeinado, 9 Phil., 613; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Raymundo, 14 Phil, 416; People 
<em>vs</em>. Badilla, 48 Phil., 718; People <em>vs</em>. Nakpil, 52 Phil., 
985).</p>
<p>Besides, the prosecution had not yet offered the confessions to prove 
conspiracy between the two accused, nor as evidence against both of them. In 
fact, the alleged confessions (both in writing and in tape recordings) had not 
yet even been identified (the presentation of Atty. Xavier was precisely for the 
purpose of identifying the confessions), much less formally offered in evidence. 
For all we know, the prosecution might still be able to adduce other proof of 
conspiracy between Consunji and Panganiban before their confessions are formally 
offered in evidence. Assuming, therefore, that section 12 of Rule 123 also 
applies to the confessions in question, it was premature for the respondent 
Court to exclude them completely on the ground that there was no prior proof of 
conspiracy.</p>
<p>It is particularly noteworthy that the exclusion of the proferred confessions 
was not made on the basis of the objection interposed by Panganiban's counsel, 
but upon an altogether different ground, which the Court issued <em>motu 
proprio</em>. Panganiban's counsel objected to Consunji's confession as evidence 
of the guilt of the other accused Panganiban, on the ground that it was hearsay 
as to the latter. But the Court, instead of ruling on this objection, put up its 
own objection to the confessions—that it could not be admitted to prove 
conspiracy between Consunji and Panganiban without prior evidence of such 
conspiracy by a number of indefinite acts, conditions, circumstances, etc. and 
completely excluded the confessions on that ground. By so doing, the Court 
overlooked that the right to object is a mere privilege which the parties may 
waive; and if the ground for objection is known and not reasonably made, the 
objection is deemed waived and the Court has no power, on its own motion, to 
disregard the evidence (Marella <em>vs</em>. Reyes, 12 Phil., 1).</p>
<p>We see no need for the present to discuss the question of the admissibility 
of the individual extrajudicial confessions of two or more accused for the 
purpose of establishing conspiracy between them through the identity of the 
confessions in essential details. After all, the confessions are not before us 
and have not even been formally offered in evidence for any purpose. Suffice it 
to say that the lower Court should have allowed such confessions to be given in 
evidence at least as against the parties who made them, and admit the same 
conditionally to establish conspiracy, in order to give the prosecution a chance 
to get into the record all the relevant evidence at its disposal to prove the 
charges. At any rate, in the final determination and consideration of the case, 
the trial Court should be able to distinguish the admissible from the 
inadmissible, and reject what, under the rules of evidence, should be 
excluded.</p>
<p>Once more, attention should be called to the ruling of this Court in the case 
of Prats &amp; Co. <em>vs</em>. Phoenix Insurance Co., 52 Phil., 807, 
816-817:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the course of long experience we have observed that justice is most 
effectively and expeditiously administered in the courts where trivial 
objections to the admission of proof are received with least favor. The practice 
of excluding evidence on doubtful objections to its materiality or technical 
objections to the form of the questions should be avoided. In a case of any 
intricacy it is impossible for a judge of first instance, in the early stages of 
the development of the proof, to know with any certainty whether testimony is 
relevant or not; and where there is no indication of bad faith on the part of 
the Attorney offering the evidence, the court may as a rule safely accept the 
testimony upon the statement of the attorney that the proof offered will be 
connected later. Moreover, it must be remembered that in the heat of the battle 
over which he presides, a judge of first instance may possibly fall into error 
in judging of the relevancy of proof where a fair and logical connection is in 
fact shown. When such a mistake is made and the proof is erroneously ruled out, 
the Supreme Court, upon appeal, often finds itself embarrassed and possibly 
unable to correct the effects of the error without returning the case for a new 
trial,—a step which this Court is always very loath to take. On the other hand, 
the admission of proof in a court of first instance, even if the question as to 
its form, materiality, or relevancy is doubtful, can never result in much harm 
to either litigant, because the trial judge is supposed to know the law; and it 
is its duty, upon final consideration of the case, to distinguish the relevant 
and material from the irrelevant and immaterial. If this course is followed and 
the cause is prosecuted to the Supreme Court upon appeal, this Court then has 
all the material before it necessary to make a correct 
judgment."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is greater reason to adhere to such policy in criminal cases where 
questions arise as to admissibility of evidence for the prosecution, for the 
unjustified exclusion of evidence may lead to the erroneous acquittal of the 
accused or the dismissal of the charges, from which the People can no longer 
appeal.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order excluding the confessions of the accused Juan Consunji 
and Alfonso Panganiban is annulled and set aside and the Court below is directed 
to proceed with the trial in accordance with law and this opinion. Costs against 
respondents Juan Consunji and Alfonso Panganiban. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Monjtemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
