ROBBERY WITH RAPE; ALIBI.—Appellants were prosecuted for 
robbery with rape and found guilty by the Court of First Instance. The only 
question on appeal is whether or not they were the persons who had perpetrated 
the offense. The appellants were recognized by both the two offended women, they 
having previously visited their house on friendly calls. Both appellants denied 
having been there, and presented several witnesses—mostly relatives and 
friends—to demonstrate their alibi. <i>Held:</i> Their alibi is weak and 
unavailing in the face of positive identification by the victims.</div>
