				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from an order&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Laguna in&nbsp; its election case No. 9518,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; Severino Arambulo,&nbsp; protestant-appellee <i>vs.</i> Sesinando&nbsp; Rizal, protestee-appellant,&nbsp; disapproving&nbsp; the&nbsp; statement of&nbsp; expenses submitted&nbsp; for approval&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; protestee, and&nbsp; from a similar&nbsp; order in election&nbsp; case No. 9519, entitled Matias Belarmino, et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; protestants-appellees <i>vs.</i> Pantaleon&nbsp; F. Alihan,&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; protestees-appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; appeals&nbsp; were certified to this Court by&nbsp; the Court of Appeals, to which appeal was prosecuted, for the reason that only questions of law are involved.<br><br>In&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; rendered by the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; in CA-G. R. No. 11205-R,&nbsp; Arambulo&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Rizal, the judgment of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Laguna in favor of&nbsp; the protestant-appellee was&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside and protestee-appellant Sesinando V.&nbsp; Rizal declared elected.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; dispositive part of the decision, it&nbsp; is expressly stated, "the appellee is hereby&nbsp; sentenced&nbsp; to pay the&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; incurred and costs."&nbsp;&nbsp; (In&nbsp; the other&nbsp; election&nbsp; case,&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 9519, all&nbsp; the protestees&nbsp; were&nbsp; declared&nbsp; winners "with costs and&nbsp; legal expenses of the&nbsp; proceedings against protestants."&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the return&nbsp; of the above cases to the Court of First Instance of Laguna, protestee-appellant Rizal in&nbsp; election&nbsp; case No. 9518 submitted a statement&nbsp; of expenses&nbsp; of litigation (see Record&nbsp; on&nbsp; Appeal, pp. 5, 20-44).&nbsp; In the other case, No. 9519, the protestee submitted a bill of costs and&nbsp; expenses for P6,018, Pl,000&nbsp; for expenses incurred in the litigation and P5,000 for attorneys fees.&nbsp; In the first case, No.&nbsp; 9518, the expenses incurred, which are contained&nbsp; in Annex "A," are classified as follows: (1) transportation and subsistence (from January 8,&nbsp; 1952 to October 16, 1953)&nbsp; of protestee, his party and his&nbsp; representative; (2)&nbsp; expert witness fee. P200;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; transportation and&nbsp; subsistence&nbsp; of witnesses (which are&nbsp; supposedly the actual amount&nbsp; spent);&nbsp; (4) counsel's fee for hearing; and (5) installment of attorney's fees,—all of which reach the total sum of P23,870.40.&nbsp; The bill of expenses was submitted to the Court of&nbsp; First Instance and the presiding judge, Hon. Federico C. Alikpala, in an order dated&nbsp; January 13, 1955, reduced the expenses and costs P728.50&nbsp; (Record on&nbsp; Appeal, p. 63). The judge in his order held that the fees&nbsp; paid to attorneys and to the expert witness, the transportation and subsistence&nbsp; of the litigants and their counsel in going&nbsp; to&nbsp; and attending court trials, cannot be considered incidental&nbsp; expenses in an&nbsp; electoral&nbsp; protest and may not therefore be taxed as costs; and that only witness'&nbsp; fees and lawful traveling as provided in the Rules are collectible, that is, at the rate&nbsp; of one&nbsp; peso a day for each witness and ten centavos per&nbsp; kilometer for his transportation. In the other case, No. 9519,&nbsp; the lower court rejected the claim&nbsp; of P1,000&nbsp; for expenses incurred for the reason&nbsp; that&nbsp; the same&nbsp; is&nbsp; not itemized.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; also rejected the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P5,000&nbsp; as&nbsp; attorneys'&nbsp; fees.&nbsp; It is against the above&nbsp; orders that the appeal has been taken.<br><br>The only provision in the Revised&nbsp; Election Code about expenses and costs in an election contest is&nbsp; that found in Section 180&nbsp; which provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 180. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bond or cash deposit.</span>—Before the courts shall take cognizance of&nbsp; a protest or a&nbsp; counter-protest or admit&nbsp; an appeal, the party&nbsp; who&nbsp; has&nbsp; filed the pleading&nbsp; or&nbsp; interposed the appeal shall file a bond with two sureties satisfactory to the court and for such amount as&nbsp; it may fix,&nbsp; to answer for the payment of all expenses and&nbsp; costs incidental to said motion or&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; or shall deposit with the court cash&nbsp; in&nbsp; lieu of&nbsp; the bond&nbsp; or both as the court&nbsp; may order.&nbsp; * * *.&nbsp; In case the&nbsp; party&nbsp; who&nbsp; has paid the expenses and costs wins, the court&nbsp; shall assess, levy and collect the same as costs from the losing party."<br></blockquote>As election&nbsp; contests are&nbsp; to be&nbsp; tried&nbsp; and decided by the courts, it is&nbsp; evident that with respect to costs such contests&nbsp; shall be governed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of Court on costs. The Rules of Court expressly provides that a witness is entitled to a daily subsistence of one peso and a travelling fee of ten centavos per kilometer for days of trial&nbsp; actually and necessarily&nbsp; attended.&nbsp; May&nbsp; a party&nbsp; in an&nbsp; election contest&nbsp; demand&nbsp; for&nbsp; travelling expenses&nbsp; and subsistence during trials amounts&nbsp; exceeding those&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; fixed in the Rules of Court?&nbsp; We do not believe so.&nbsp; There being no&nbsp; express&nbsp; provision fixing&nbsp; costs&nbsp; in&nbsp; election cases, those fixed&nbsp; by the Rules for ordinary court cases should govern, as&nbsp; trial of such cases are&nbsp; held&nbsp; by the courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither do we believe that they&nbsp; can be justified as expenses because that would authorize a party to&nbsp; collect amounts beyond what the&nbsp; Rules provide.&nbsp;&nbsp; So when the Court of&nbsp; Appeals decreed that the loser&nbsp; shall pay costs&nbsp; it could not have meant that expenses which are ordinarily known&nbsp; as costs were&nbsp; chargeable&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; losing party.<br><br>What&nbsp; then&nbsp; is the&nbsp; concept of&nbsp; the&nbsp; term "expenses" mentioned in the decision and in the law? Two cases decided by this Court,&nbsp; namely, those of Torres <i>vs.</i> Ribo, 92 Phil., 1019 and Fojas&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Garcia, 92 Phil., 983 have explained the concept of this term.&nbsp; In the first case attorneys' fees and expenses incurred for securing&nbsp; stenographic notes as&nbsp; well as for printing&nbsp; the&nbsp; brief in the counter-protest were&nbsp; rejected,&nbsp; but the commissioners'&nbsp; fees of P2,008.00 paid&nbsp; for&nbsp; checking the ballots&nbsp; were considered&nbsp; taxable as&nbsp; expenses.&nbsp; In the second case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P4,672.00 paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; the revisors&nbsp; of the ballots&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P200&nbsp; as fee to the clerk of&nbsp; court&nbsp; for acting&nbsp; as chairman of said revisors, and P200 for transportation, handling and custody&nbsp; of the ballot boxes were&nbsp; allowed.&nbsp; These two decisions establish the&nbsp; rule that&nbsp; expenses incidental to&nbsp; an election contest,&nbsp; like&nbsp; revisors' or commissioners' fees&nbsp; are taxable as expenses.&nbsp; The work of commissioners is a part of the judicial process; so is that of revisors of ballots, and the handling of ballot boxes, etc.&nbsp; The word "expenses" in election contests, therefore, should mean actual expenses connected with&nbsp; the trial and not expenses that attorneys and their clients may have incurred in preparing for trial and in defending their side&nbsp; of&nbsp; the case.&nbsp; So&nbsp; should the collection of ballot boxes, their handling and preservation, the fees of commissioners&nbsp; or referees appointed&nbsp; by the court to examine the ballots and make their reports to the court&nbsp; be considered expenses&nbsp; contemplated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; law.<br><br>The&nbsp; supposed&nbsp; expenses included&nbsp; in the bill of costs submitted by the protestee-appellant which were&nbsp; not for transportation and subsistence of the protestee, his party or his&nbsp; representative, were&nbsp; either for his own attorney's fees and for his&nbsp; expert witness' fee,&nbsp; both of which are entirely for his own&nbsp; personal&nbsp; benefit.<br><br>Attorneys' fees are never considered as costs; unless it&nbsp; is expressly provided by the law&nbsp; or imposed&nbsp; by the judge&nbsp; as costs they&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; charged&nbsp; against the other party.&nbsp; Attorneys' fees are&nbsp; the subject of an express provision of the Civil Code&nbsp; in special&nbsp; cases.&nbsp; The Rules, on&nbsp; the other&nbsp; hand, allow&nbsp; P40.00 only&nbsp; for the appearance of a&nbsp; party and his attorney and this sum may not&nbsp; be increased except&nbsp; under express provisions of law or&nbsp; of the judgment of the&nbsp; court.<br><br>Finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; judgments appealed from&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp; in accordance with the&nbsp; law&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules,&nbsp; it is hereby affirmed,&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; against&nbsp;&nbsp; the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J.
