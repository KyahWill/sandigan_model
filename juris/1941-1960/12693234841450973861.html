				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> The plaintiff-appellant instituted this action in the Court of 
First Instance of Negros Oriental for the partition of two parcels of land 
described in his amended complaint, alleging as cause of action the following 
facts:
<p align="justify">That he is the natural child of Francisca Piñero, born on 
November 4, 1895, when his mother could have legally married his father with or 
without dispensation; and that he has been legally acknowledged by his mother as 
such natural child, and has been in the uninterrupted possession of the status 
of a natural child of said Francisca Piñero, justified by her own conduct and 
that of her family, specially the defendants herein;</p>
<p align="justify">That long after plaintiff's birth Francisca Piñero married the 
defendant Marcelo Enriquez; that the defendant Pedro Enriquez and Paz Enriquez 
are the legitimate children of Marcelo Enriquez and Francisca Piñero; that the 
defendant Randol Ingan is their legitimate grandson, being the only child of 
their daughter Soledad Enriquez, who died on March 14, 1940; and that Francisca 
Piñero died on August 29, 1929, leaving the two parcels of land described in the 
complaint, which she had acquired during her marriage to Marcelo Enriquez;</p>
<p align="justify">That after Francisca Piñero's death, the defendants took 
possession of the parcels of land in question and have since then enjoyed them 
to the exclusion of the plaintiff, and that notwithstanding repeated requests 
the defendants have refused to partition the properties in question or to give 
to the plaintiff his corresponding share in the yearly produce thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff prayed for the partition of said properties in 
the proportions provided by law and for his share in the produce thereof from 
1929 at the rate of P325 per annum.</p>
<p align="justify">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the 
ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
That motion was sustained by His Honor Judge Sotero B. Cabahug on the theory 
that the plaintiff could not inherit from his deceased mother without having 
been legally acknowledged by her as her natural child, and that since his mother 
had died long after he had reached the age of majority, the plaintiff could not 
in the present action ask for such compulsory recognition in order to be 
entitled to the inheritance in question.</p>
<p align="justify">In reaching that conclusion the trial judge considered as 
insufficient proof of recognition the documents attached to the record 
consisting of plaintiff's certificate of birth and baptism and certain letters 
written by the defendants to the plaintiff. Thus in effect the trial judge 
practically decided the case on the merits in resolving defendants' motion to 
dismiss.</p>
<p align="justify">We think that the trial court erred in dismissing the 
complaint. The motion to dismiss was based on the ground that the complaint did 
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. It having been 
expressly alleged in the complaint "that the said <i>plaintiff has been legally 
acknowledged</i> by the late Francisca Piñero <i>as such natural child</i>," and 
that allegation having been hypothetically admitted by the defendants' motion to 
dismiss, the court could not dismiss the complaint on the theory that that 
allegation is not true.</p>
<p align="justify">It seems that after the plaintiff had filed an opposition to 
defendants' motion to dismiss, the trial court ordered him to submit his proofs 
of his status as a natural child of Francisca Piñero, and in compliance with 
said order the attorney for the plaintiff filed a "manifestation" submitting 
five documents consisting of the certificate of birth and baptism (Exhibit A) 
and certain letters marked as Exhibits B, C, C-1, and C-2. In said, 
manifestation counsel for the plaintiff stated: "These are the doctunentary 
evidence in support of the complaint. The oral evidence is ready to be presented 
if the Honorable Court so desires." The trial court resolved the motion to 
dismiss upon said documents and not upon the allegations of the complaint.</p>
<p align="justify">We find such procedure to be irregular and not authorized by 
the Rules. The question submitted to the court upon the motion to dismiss was 
whether the facts alleged in the complaint were sufficient to constitute a cause 
of action, and not whether those allegations of fact were true. If the court 
thought said allegations to be sufficient but doubted their veracity, it should 
deny the motion to dismiss and require the defendants to answer and then proceed 
to try the case on the merits. Section 3 of Rule 8 provides: "After hearing [the 
motion to dismiss] the court may deny or grant the motion or allow amendment of 
pleading, or may defer the hearing and determination of the motion until the 
trial if the ground alleged therein does not appear to be indubitable." The 
trial court should have heard all the evidence before deciding the case on the 
merits.</p>
<p align="justify">Finding that plaintiff's amended complaint states facts 
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, we reverse the trial court's order 
of dismissal and order the case remanded to the court of origin for further 
proceedings, with the costs of this instance against the appellees.</p> <i>Paras, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes,</i> and 
<i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
