				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Plaintiffs instituted this  action in the Municipal Court of Manila to recover from defendant their salary differentials and overtime pay.  Salary differentials  are claimed on the  ground that defendant,  who had employed plaintiffs,  had paid  them wages below  that  provided  for by the Minimum Wage Law, and overtime  pay  is demanded because he made them work for more than eight hours  in violation  of the Eight-Hour Labor Law.  However, 10 days after the action was filed and before defendant could be summoned, plaintiffs filed a notice of dismissal.  There upon the judge dismissed the case, but on the same day he made  the dismissal  with prejudice.   These  dismissals bear the  date of February 10, 1954.   On  February 22, 1954, plaintiffs moved to set aside the order of dismissal and for the  reinstatement  of the complaint  and trial on the merits,  alleging that the plaintiffs'  notice  to dismiss had been  secured by defendant through fraud.   This was supposed  to consist  in defendant's promising to reemploy the plaintiffs but without  doing so after the complaint had been dismissed.  This motion  to  set aside and reinstate the  case was  denied by  the  municipal court on March 16,  1954.  Of  this  order plaintiffs  were notified on March 27.   On March 29, plaintiffs moved to reconsider the order denying the motion to set aside.  The court denied this motion on  April  10, and  upon being notified thereof on April 19, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal dated  April 24, 1954,  seven days from date of notice of order denying motion to set aside.  On April 24, 1954, they also presented a motion to litigate  and  appeal as paupers.  The court approved this motion  on May 20, 1954 and  gave  due course to  the appeal.</p>
<p>The case having  been registered in the Court of  First Instance,  defendant promptly filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the  ground  that the municipal  court denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration properly and that the appeal was not  perfected  within the time  prescribed by the  rules.  After receiving the opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss the  appeal, the court reversed the  order of the municipal court refusing to reconsider its order  to set aside the dismissal, and remanded the case to the court of  origin for further proceedings as  provided by section 10 of  Rule  40 of the  Rules (inasmuch  as there had been no trial in the court below, the case having been dismissed without a valid trial upon the merits).   From this  order of  reversal  and remand, defendant  appealed  to this  Court after an attempt on his part to have the order reconsidered.</p>
<p>On this appeal various assignments of error have been made, among which are the following: that the Court of First Instance  could not consider in the appeal thereto the order of  February 10, 1954, dismissing the complaint, because the notice of appeal expressly states that the appeal is being made  against the order of the court of April 10, 1954; that the order of dismissal of&nbsp; February 10, 1954, was not appealable; that the appeal was  not  perfected in time  (which  is  not  correct);  etc.</p>
<p>Without considering the  merits  of the  errors assigned as above indicated, we are forced to state that the appeal is premature, as no final judgment or order has yet been rendered for one party or the other (section 2, Rule 41). The order of the Court of  First  Instance remanding the case to the justice  of the  peace  for trial on the merits is merely an  interlocutory order which does  not constitute a final judgment terminating  the  case.</p>
<p>The appeal is  hereby  dismissed, with costs  against appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.  J.,  Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,  Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and  <em>Endencia,  JJ., </em>concur.</p>
