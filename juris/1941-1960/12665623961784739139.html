				<H3>AGAPITO ALAJAR, ET AL., PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, VS. HON. COURT OF INDUSTRIAL, RELATIONS AND CIRILO P. BAYLOSIS, ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES. BUREAU OF LANDS, INTERVENOR.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari to review the decision of the Court of 
Industrial Relations in eight tenancy cases (Nos. 871-R to 878-R of that Court) 
wherein it ordered the division of the palay produce of the lands in question 
for the crop year 1950-1951 between petitioners herein (tenants) and respondents 
Cirilo P. Baylosis, et al. (landlords),on the ratio of 70-30 in favor of the 
tenants, the quantity of the harvest of each landholding to be based on the 
estimates of the number of cavanes produced by each, as listed in the decision 
(Annex G, Petition). It is claimed by petitioners that the Court below acted 
with grave abuse of discretion in estimating the harvest in terms of cavans 
instead of cans, allegedly in complete disregard of the decision of the Court of 
First Instance of Batangas in Expropriation Proceedings No. 84, and of this 
Court in G. R. L-6191.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup>
<p>It appears that the landholdings involved herein formed part of the tracts of 
land which the government sought to expropriate in Expropriation Proceedings No. 
84 of the Court of First Instance of Batangas for resale to the tenants. The 
Batangas Court decided in favor of the expropriation and ordered the transfer of 
the lands in question to the Bureau of Lands. On appeal to this Court, however, 
the expropriation proceedings were dismissed (G. R. L-6191). These tenancy cases 
arose before the filing of the expropriation proceedings; and as the Court of 
Industrial Relations found after trial that the tenants-defendants harvested 
their palay produce for the crop year 1950-1951 before the transfer of their 
landholdings to the Bureau of Lands in Expropriation Proceedings No. 84, said 
Court ordered the division of the harvest on the ratio of 70-30 in favor of the 
tenants on the basis of the estimates of the number of cavans produced in each 
landholdings submitted by the landlords. It is this decision that is now the 
subject of the present petition.</p>
<p>The petition is patently without merit. In the first place, it is not even 
sufficient in form and substance to justify the issuance of the writ of 
certiorari prayed for. It charges that the Court of Industrial Relations abused 
its discretion in disregarding the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Batangas in Expropriation Proceedings No. 84 and of this Court in G. R. L-6191; 
yet it does not attach to the petition the decisions allegedly violated by the 
Court below and point out which particular portion or portions thereof have been 
disregarded by $he respondent Court.</p>
<p>We have taken it upon ourselves to look up and consult the decisions referred 
to; and have found that neither our decision in G. R. L-6191, nor the decision 
of the Court of First Instance of Batangas in Expropriation Proceedings No. 84 
(which was reversed in G. R. L-6191) said anything about harvests, or the 
division thereof. We are thus constrained to agree with respondents-appellees 
that these certiorari proceedings were instituted merely to further delay the 
division of the harvest between the parties which has been pending litigation 
since 1950.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the petition for certiorari is dismissed. Petitioners shall pay 
the costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador</em> and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
