Abalos wrote to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, coursing it through&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee,&nbsp; requesting that&nbsp; the temporary&nbsp; stay of&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; visistors&nbsp; be&nbsp; extended&nbsp; for another three months.&nbsp; On 7 November 1955 the appellee wrote to the appellant reminding him that the authorized temporary&nbsp; stay of&nbsp; the two visitors&nbsp; already had expired on&nbsp; 1&nbsp; November&nbsp; 1955, requiring him,&nbsp; as bondsman,&nbsp; to effect their departure not&nbsp; later&nbsp; than 12 November 1955, and enclosing&nbsp; a copy of the letter of the Undersecretary for&nbsp; Foreign Affairs dated 29&nbsp; October 1955, where the latter&nbsp; suggested&nbsp; that, as&nbsp; a matter of policy, the mere filing&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitions for extension&nbsp; of&nbsp; stay&nbsp; of temporary visitors be not considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; a reason for&nbsp; allowing them to stay beyond the period actually authorized and that in cases where the Dapartment of Foreign&nbsp; Affairs should state that the same would be the last extension&nbsp; to&nbsp; be granted the&nbsp; alien&nbsp; concerned,&nbsp; no&nbsp; further petitions&nbsp; be accepted or coursed by that Bureau to that Department; and requested the cooperation of the Bureau&nbsp; of Immigration by taking appropriate steps to effect&nbsp; the departure of&nbsp; all those whose authorized&nbsp; stay already&nbsp; had expired regardless of whether they had filed&nbsp; petitions for extension, if such petitions had&nbsp; not been acted upon on the last day of their&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; stay.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 10 November&nbsp; 1955 the&nbsp; appellant wrote to the appellee&nbsp; requesting that the temporary&nbsp; stay of&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; visitors&nbsp; be extended&nbsp; to&nbsp; 30 November because he and&nbsp; his wife had to wind up family affairs in&nbsp; Manila and that he had to&nbsp; prepare for&nbsp; their airplane booking&nbsp; and necessary&nbsp; bank&nbsp; licenses.&nbsp; On the same date,&nbsp; 10&nbsp; November, the appellee denied his request. On 11 November&nbsp; 1955 the appellant wrote&nbsp; to the appellee acknowledging receipt&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; letter&nbsp; dated 7&nbsp; November 1955,&nbsp; reiterating&nbsp; his request&nbsp; for&nbsp; a few days extension of&nbsp; the visitors'&nbsp; temporary stay and promising not&nbsp; to ask for further extension.&nbsp; He assured the appellee that should they fail to depart from the country at the expiration of the period of grace&nbsp; granted,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; could confiscate the&nbsp; bonds he&nbsp; had&nbsp; filed.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; same date, 11&nbsp; November, Jose R. Abalos,&nbsp; counsel for&nbsp; the appellant, wrote&nbsp; to the appellee requesting&nbsp; for&nbsp; extension up&nbsp; to&nbsp; 18 November&nbsp; 1955 of the visitors' temporary stay.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 14 November 1955 the appellee granted the appellant's request for extension tip to 19 November 1955 within which&nbsp; to cause the departure of the two temporary visitors.&nbsp; On 16&nbsp; November 1955, Attorney&nbsp; Apolonio A. Gonzalez,&nbsp; in behalf of the&nbsp; two visitors, wrote to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary for Foreign&nbsp; Affairs&nbsp; requesting for&nbsp; three&nbsp; months&nbsp; extension of their&nbsp; temporary stay.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 17 November 1955,&nbsp; in&nbsp; his indorsement to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee,&nbsp; the Secretary for Foreign Affairs authorized the temporary stay of the two visitors for another&nbsp; three&nbsp; months from&nbsp; the expiration of&nbsp; the period of their original&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; stay, provided that their&nbsp; reentry permits to&nbsp; Hongkong continue to&nbsp; be valid at least&nbsp; one month over and&nbsp; beyond their extended stay and provided that the cash bonds&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with the Bureau of Immigration in their&nbsp; behalf be&nbsp; maintained.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 22 November 1955 the appellee&nbsp; wrote to the appellant&nbsp; advising him that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; for Foreign Affairs had granted&nbsp; Attorney Apolonio A.&nbsp; Gonzales, request&nbsp; for a three months extension&nbsp; of the two visitors'&nbsp; temporary stay, but that the cash bonds filed by him (the&nbsp; appellant) in favor of the&nbsp; Bureau of Immigration in their&nbsp; behalf were&nbsp; declared forfeited in favor of the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; for violation of the terms and conditions thereof&nbsp; in asking for extension of their temporary stay and in&nbsp; failing to depart from&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; on&nbsp; 19 November 1955,&nbsp; the date set for their departure by the appellee; and requiring him to file new cash&nbsp; bonds in the&nbsp; same amounts for&nbsp; the visitors within&nbsp; 48 hours&nbsp; from receipt of notice.&nbsp; On 25 November 1955&nbsp; the law firm&nbsp; of Gianzon, Uy and&nbsp; Calma wrote&nbsp; to the&nbsp; appellee requesting extension&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; 30 November&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; within which&nbsp; to&nbsp; raise&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount to put up the cash bonds or to avail of other remedies under the circumstances.&nbsp; On 26 November 1955&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellee granted the appellant's request and postponed the issuance of warrants for the arrest of the visistors until 30 November 1955, but required him (the appellant) to file the cash bonds of P14,000 before that date or cause&nbsp; them to leave the country on&nbsp; said date.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 9&nbsp; December 1955 the appellant filed an additional cash bond of P3,000 for&nbsp; the temporary stay of the visitors&nbsp; up to&nbsp; their departure on 7 January 1956.&nbsp; On the last mentioned date&nbsp; the two visitors departed from the Philippines.<br><br>Section 40, paragraph (a), sub-paragraph (1), Commonwealth Act No. 613, provides that "The Commissioner of Immigration shall have the power to exact bonds in such amounts and containing such conditions as he may prescribe" " to control and regulate the admission into, and departure from, the philippines of aliens applying for temporary admission." The cash bonds filed by the appellant in behalf of the temporary visitors, which embody the same terms and conditions, partly provide;<br><blockquote>WHEAREAS, the undersigned ANG LIONG has applied to the Commissioner of Immigration of the temporary admission into the Philippines under Section 9, of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, of one ONG SIU, Chinese female, 35 years of age, a passenger of the ..................due to arrive/ who arrived at the port of Manila, on...................................., 195.....I, C. No.................................;<br><br>AND WHEREAS, the Commissioner of Immigration has agreed to the temporary stay of said ONG SIU upon filing a cash bond of TEN THOUSAND PESOS, Phil. Currency, with the Bureau of Immigration (Official Receipt No. A-0382921, dated June 27, 1955), (P10,000.00), which cash bond is subject to the following conditions:<br><br>(a) That the undersigned, with full knowledge that ONG SIU is a temporary visitor whose authorized stay in this country is limited only up to (status) and including 3 months, 195........, do hereby undertake that said ONG SIU will actually depart from the Philippines on or before said date so specified, or within such period, as in his discretion, the Commissioner of Immigration or his authorized representative may properly allow;<br><br>(a-1) That the undersigned hereby guarantees that no request for extension of the original authorized stay of three (3) months will be filed by him, the alien himself/herself or any other person in his or her behalf;<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*<br><br>That breach of any of the conditions above-mentioned shall entitle the Commissioner of Immigration to declare this cash bond or part thereof forfeited, but shall not release the undersigned from the obligation to produce said ONG SIU for such action as may be taken against him/her.&nbsp; no modification of this agreement shall be valid and effective unless made in writing and&nbsp; signed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; of Immigration or his duly authorized representative.<br></blockquote>Paragraphs (a) (a-1)&nbsp; of the&nbsp; terms and conditions&nbsp; of the bonds filed by the appellant in behalf of the two temporary visitors were violated because instead of departing&nbsp; from the Philippines on 19 November 1955, the date set by the&nbsp; appellee for their departure, on 16 November 1955 Attorney Apolonio A. Gonzales requested the Secretary for Foreign Affairs in their behalf to authorize&nbsp; an extension of three months of their temporary stay from the expiration of the period of their original authorized&nbsp; temporary stay, which request was granted under the terms and conditions&nbsp; stated in an indorsement dated 17 November&nbsp; 1955. Hence the appellee was justified in declaring the bonds forfeited for violation of the terms thereof.<br><br>Appellant's claim that the extensions sought by Attorney Jose R. Abalos on 1&nbsp; October 1955, before&nbsp; the&nbsp; expiration of the original period, and by Attorney Apolonio A. Gonzales on 16 November 1955, in behalf of the two visitors, from&nbsp; the Secretary for&nbsp; Foreign Affairs, are not violative of the terms and conditions of the bonds&nbsp; and of the appellant's promise made in his letter dated 11 November 1955 not to&nbsp; ask for further&nbsp; extensions,&nbsp; is without&nbsp; merit and does not alter&nbsp; the fact that the terms of the bond&nbsp; were violated because of their failure to depart from the&nbsp; Philippines on 19 November 1955, the date set by the appellee for their departure, and for that&nbsp; reason&nbsp; the forfeiture of the bonds, as already&nbsp; stated, was justified.<br><br>The fact that the Secretary for&nbsp; Foreign Affairs granted their request for another three months extension from the expiration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the original&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; their temporary&nbsp; stay&nbsp; does&nbsp; not relieve&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; from liability on the bonds&nbsp; for violation of&nbsp; their terms and conditions.&nbsp; His undertakings in the bonds guaranteeing "that no request&nbsp; for extension of the original authorized stay of three (3) months will be filed by him,&nbsp; the&nbsp; alien himself/herself or any other person in his or her behalf" and to effect&nbsp; their&nbsp; departure&nbsp; upon expiration of&nbsp; their authorized&nbsp; period of temporary&nbsp; stay,&nbsp; or within&nbsp; such period at the discretion of the Commissioner of Immigration&nbsp; or&nbsp; his authorized&nbsp; representative may&nbsp; allow, are contractual, and the Secretary for&nbsp; Foreign Affairs cannot "alter, vary&nbsp; or modify them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 613 governs the entry of aliens into the Philippines:&nbsp; Under section 3&nbsp; of the same&nbsp; Act, the Commissioner&nbsp; is the administrative&nbsp; head of the Bureau of Immigration and in charge of the&nbsp; administration of all&nbsp; laws&nbsp; relating to the immigration of aliens into the Philippines.&nbsp; Under section 47&nbsp; of the same Act, when&nbsp; public interest so warrants, the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; may "admit, as&nbsp; non- immigrants, aliens&nbsp; not&nbsp; otherwise provided for&nbsp; by this Act, who are coming for temporary period only, under such conditions as he may prescribe."&nbsp; The Secretary for Foreign Affairs is not authorized to&nbsp; admit into the&nbsp; Philippines aliens for temporary stay, or&nbsp; extend the period authorized by the&nbsp; Commissioner of Immigration for&nbsp; their stay in the&nbsp; Philippines.<br><br>The letter dated 15 September&nbsp; 1954 of the Executive Secretary to the&nbsp; Secretary for&nbsp; Foreign&nbsp; Affairs,&nbsp; quoted in full by the&nbsp; appellant on pages 45 to 46 of his brief, which does not form part&nbsp; of the&nbsp; stipulation of&nbsp; facts entered into by and&nbsp; between the parties, where the Secretary for Foreign&nbsp; Affairs was informed that the&nbsp; Cabinet at its meeting decided that "requests&nbsp; for extension beyond the three-month period under the Cabinet&nbsp; policy embodied in the letter of this Office dated March 22,&nbsp; 1954 from&nbsp; those who have been admitted&nbsp; to the Philippines as&nbsp; temporary visitors,"&nbsp; "should&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered and acted upon by the Department of Foreign Affairs, along with the power to process and approve applications for&nbsp; entry of aliens under established&nbsp; categories," did not and&nbsp; does&nbsp; not deprive the Commissioner of Immigration of his powers to declare a bond forfeited for&nbsp; violation or breach&nbsp; of its terms or conditions.&nbsp; The Secretary for&nbsp; Foreign&nbsp; Affairs was merely authorized by the Cabinet to act upon requests from temporary&nbsp; visitors for extension of their stay beyond three months, and such authority did not relieve the bondsman from the&nbsp; liability for breach of the terms&nbsp; and conditions of the bonds.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.
