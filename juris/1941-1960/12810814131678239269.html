				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On July 16, 1946, Pedro Ruiz brought the present action in the 
Court of First Instance of Manila for the recovery of P80,440.00, the 
total of various sums alleged to have been advanced by plaintiff to the 
defendant Amos G. Bellis during the Japanese occupation.
  <p>    Answering the complaint, defendant denied the alleged advances 
or loans except as to the sum of P500.00 evidenced by a promissory note 
and invoked moratorium as a defense.  After various hearings had been 
had, defendant filed a motion for the dismissal of the case on the 
ground of moratorium, and the motion having been granted over 
plaintiff's objection, the latter has appealed to this Court, contending
 that Executive Order No. 25, dated November 18, 1944, and Executive 
Order No. 32, dated March 10, 1945, as amended by Republic Act No. 342, 
providing for moratorium are void.</p>
  <p>    This contention we have to uphold in view of our decision in 
the case of Royal L. Rutter <i>vs.</i> Placido J. Esteban, G. R. No. 
L-3708, promulgated May 18, 1953, declaring said Executive Orders void.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the order appealed from is revoked and the case 
remanded to the court below for further proceedings, with costs against 
the appellee.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.<br> 
    <i>Padilla, J.,</i> no part.</p>
