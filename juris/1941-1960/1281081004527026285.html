				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of
 Cebu, Honorable Florentino Saguin presiding, finding Pedro Gerona 
guilty of treason with robbery, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty
 of <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> to pay a fine of P10,000.00 to indemnify 
the offended party Placido Lopez in the sum of P1,600 for the effects 
that he had taken away, and to pay the costs.
  <p>    The information under which the herein accused-appellant was 
tried in an amended information dated October 4, 1950, charging the 
accused-appellant on five counts.  The court found him guilty on three 
counts, that of having acted as a spy, investigating Placido Lopez of 
guerrilla activities and robbing him of jewels and clothes worth 
P1,600.00; that of having investigated Fidel Oberes and Lorenzo Amfre 
for being guerrillas or volunteer guards and beating them; and that of 
having caused the arrest of one Victoriano Primacia, investigating him 
for being a guerrilla, and beating him in the course of the 
investigation, the said Victoriano Primacia having thereafter 
disappeared without coming back to him home.</p>
  <p>    On counts 1 and 2, the evidence for the prosecution shows that 
in the evening of November 3, 1944, after 9:00 o'clock, 
accused-appellant went up the house of Placido Lopez at Calamba street, 
Cebu City, accompanied by Franciso Lopez, Placido's brother.  Placido 
Lopez had just put out the light, and as appellant herein knocked at the
 door and Placido opened it, appellant immediately gave him a blow on 
the face with his fist, knocking him down.  Placido was asked about one 
Quirino (Torres), a guerrilla, and for Placido's revolver, and as 
Placido denied the whereabouts of said Quirino and having any revolver 
at all, appellant hanged him and beat him.  For his part, Francisco was 
brought to a nearby room and was also investigated and maltreated by 
Tenebro, a companion spy of the appellant.  While the appellant and his 
companion were investigating and beating the Lopezes, appellant's 
Japanese companion ransacked the wardrobe and effects of Placido and 
took away cash, jewels, and clothing all amounting in value to 
P1,600.00.  After the investigation and after taking away the articles 
above-mentioned, appellant and his companions took Placido and Francisco
 to a station at the Redemptorist church.  From here they were taken the
 following day to a certain house belonging to one Paulin, which was 
used as Kempetai headquarters.  Here they were again investigated, their
 hands tied at the back, then suspended from the air, and beaten with a 
baseball bat.  The companions of the appellant in conducting the 
investigation and maltreating the two brothers were one Ato Adlawan and 
Tenebro, both well known spies for the Japanese.  The two brothers, 
however, were allowed to go away on the occasion of an American air raid
 on Cebu City.</p>
  <p>    The evidence submitted on count No. 5 is to the effect that on 
December 23, 1944, Fidel Oberes, Lorenzo Amfre, and others started on a 
sailboat from Cebu bound for Bohol, with the intention of evacuating to 
Clarin, Bohol.  While they were between Talisay and Bag-ong Banua, a 
Japanese patrol launch detained them and towed them to Cebu City.  Fidel
 Oberes, Lorenzo Amfre, and others were arrested by two Japanese 
undercovers, Placido Lastimosa and Isidro Cabonesas, who brought them, 
with their hands tied at the back, to a place near the San Nicolas 
church.  From there they were brought to the headquarters of the 
Japanese kempetai, and there they were investigated by a Japanese 
undercover by the name of Ate Adlawan.  Fidel Oberes was later brought 
to a room where he was investigated by the appellant herein Pedro 
Gerona.  The appellant asked Oberes the amount of fish and corn that his
 (Oberes') mother had contributed to the guerrillas, but Oberes replied 
that he did not know as he seldom saw his mother, and the latter had 
just enough to make a living.  After that appellant asked him again who 
among his companions were volunteer guards, but Oberes denied the charge
 that any one of them was a volunteer guard.  The companions of Oberes 
were also investigated by the companions of Gerona.  Thereafter they 
were brought to a house on Figueroa street, and while they were brought 
to a house on Figueroa street, and while they were walking appellant put
 his arm around Oberes' shoulder and under threats asked him to tell the
 truth and admit that he was a volunteer guard.  When they reached the 
house at Figueroa street, Tenebro was ordered to tie Oberes' hand at the
 back, and after he was so tied he was given blows on the face by both 
appellant and Tenebro.  It was while they were thus confined that Oberes
 saw Victoriano Primacia and Juan Unabia got down from the truck at the 
house where they were detained, and they were also investigated and 
maltreated by Gerona.  Both Oberes and Amfre were detained in that house
 on Figueroa street from December 23 to December 31.</p>
  <p>    In so far as Lorenzo Amfre is concerned, it was the appellant 
who also investigated him, and questions were asked him whether or not 
he was a guerrilla or a volunteer guard.  As Amfre made denials, Gerona 
struck him in the mouth and back, as a consequence of which four of his 
front teeth, two up and two down, were pulled out.</p>
  <p>    On the sixth count, the evidence for the prosecution is to the 
effect that on December 26, 1944, while Lebiosa Unabia Primacia was at 
home in Minglanilla, Cebu two Filipino spies came and asked her for her 
husband, Victoriano Primacia.  She told them that he was in the house of
 Attorney Juezan, where he was playing majhong.  After this she saw her 
husband being conducted from the housde of Juezan, with both hands tied 
at the back, and appellant Gerona with him.  Gerona questioned him, 
charging him with being a G.I. or a guerrilla, and showing a list 
supposed to contain the names of G.I. members.  Primacia's brother was 
also charged with being G.I. and investigated and maltreated.  After the
 investigation both brothers were taken to the headquarters of the 
Japanese kempetai.  As Gerona and his companions took them away, 
Victoriano Primacia's wife was told that both her husband and the 
latter's brother were guilty.  Since their arrest Victoriano Primacia 
has never returned.</p>
  <p>    The prosecution proved and the appellant admitted that he is a 
Filipino.  The evidence submitted by the prosecution on the above facts 
satisfies the two-witness rule.</p>
  <p>    The defense presented by the defendant-appellant are a denial 
and an alibi.  He admits that he had been close to the Japanese because 
he had a big business selling them tires, batteries, frigidaires, 
electrical supplies, etc., but claims that he left Cebu before the end 
of October, 1944, evacuating to Clarin, Bohol, where he was investigated
 and detained as a Japanese spy and jailed in the guerrilla barracks 
until March, 1945.</p>
  <p>    Witnesses were submitted by defendant-appellant to disprove the
 charge that he was in Cebu acting as spy.  The first one is Dario Rama,
 but his testimony is limited to stating that he did not see appellant 
in T. Padilla street after the bombing.  The evident reason is because 
by that time the appellant, after leaving his store, which was hit by 
bombs, joined the Japanese kempetai.  Furthermore, this witness declared
 that he left T. Padilla street and went to live in another place, and 
merely stated that he did not know what appellant was engaged in after 
November 20.</p>
  <p>    Another witness presented by the defense is one Jose R. 
Makawili, who claims to have seen Victoriano Unabia arrested, then to 
have evacuated to Clarin, Bohol, with Unabia's family, and to have seen 
appellant in Clarin, Bohol, then already under detention.  But the wife 
of Unabia denied having been with this witness on their trip to Bohol, 
which took place on December 31, not December 28, as claimed by this 
witness.  This witness knowledge about Unabia's arrest is also put to 
doubt by his allegation that the arrest took place in Unabia's house, 
whereas Unabia's wife and daughter testified that the arrest took place 
in another house.</p>
  <p>    A third witness, Samson Sabalones, declared that he was 
appellant detained in Clarin, Bohol, one week after October 29, or about
 November 10.  This is in conflict with the testimony of Placido Lopez 
and Francisco Lopez, who positively identified appellant as the one who 
arrested them on November 10.  It is to be noted that this witness 
declared that the commanding officer of the battalion or company by whom
 appellant was detained was one Pedro Camacho, yet this supposed 
commanding officer was not produced in court to testify.</p>
  <p>    Appellant himself testified that he left Cebu on October 13, 
1944, arriving at Clarin, Bohol, on October 17, 1944, and that thereupon
 the volunteer guards subjected him to an investigation, and thereafter 
detained him until March, 1945.</p>
  <p>    The trial court did not give credit to the denials of the 
defendant-appellant and his supposed absence in Cebu during the days 
when his victims were arrested.  We find no reason or ground for 
disturbing this finding.  We have carefully read the testimonies of the 
witnesses, and while those for the prosecution were clear, positive, and
 direct as to appellant's identity as the spy who caused the arrest, 
those of the defense are mere denials, general assertions, lacking that 
concreteness and details as to facts and circumstances characteristic of
 truthful testimony.</p>
  <p>    The only argument of counsel for appellant which calls for 
serious consideration is the improbability of appellant's responsibility
 for the arrest of Victoriano Primacia in view of the fact that the 
latter was close to appellant, having been the one responsible for 
appellant's marriage to Lina Nolasco, a teacher under Victoriano Unabia.
  It is to be noted, however, that appellant was not alone when Unabia 
was arrested.  He was with two other undercovers, and he could not have 
evaded his duties.  Besides, the wife of Unabia would not have testified
 against appellant if it were not true that he was with the raiding 
party.</p>
  <p>    It can be stated, however, in mitigation of appellant's 
responsibility, that the evidence does not show that he ever maltreated 
Unabia or that he was responsible for his execution.  Under these 
circumstances, it would seem that the penalty imposed by the trial 
court, that of life imprisonment, is not in accord with other decisions 
of this Court, which have imposed only an imprisonment of 15 years for 
those who have acted as Japanese spies, maltreating guerrillas, without 
being responsible for their death or execution.</p>
  <p>    WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction is hereby affirmed in all
 respects, except that the sentence imposed is hereby reduced to 
imprisonment for not less than 15 years of <i>reclusion temporal.</i> 
With costs against the appellant.</p>

Reyes, Jugo</i> and <i>Bautista Angelo, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
