				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original petition for mandamus filed by petitioners Estrella E. 
Serrano, Leonor E. Almazan, Concepcion E. Tobias, Leticia E. Salvador, and Paz 
E. Tolentino, under Section 15, Rule 41, of the Rules of Court, to compel 
respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, to certify and elevate 
to this Court the record on appeal in Special Proceedings Nos. 2598 and 
2600.
<p>It appears that Special Proceedings Nos. 2598 (In the Matter of the Testate 
Estate of the deceased Jose L. Elchico, Eduardo V. Elchico, Petitioner), and 
2600 (In the Matter of the Intestate Estate of the deceased Jose L. Elchico, 
Florencio Elchico, et al., Petitioners) were joined together in the sala of 
respondent Judge since 1957, the above-mentioned petitioners Estrella E. 
Serrano, et al., on the one hand, and respondents Eduardo V. Elchico, Florencio 
Elchico, Elena V. Elchico, Dominador Elchico, Alfredo Elchico, Clara E. Casanas, 
Gloria E. Aldana, and Rosalinda de Pano, on the other hand, being the contending 
parties.</p>
<p>On February 23, 1959, respondent Judge issued an order of the following 
tenor, approving a Compromise Settlement executed by the parties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Petitioner Eduardo V. Elchico, assisted by counsel, submitted a 
manifestation on February 21, 1959, together with the conformity thereto in 
writing of Florencio Elchico, one of the petitioners in Sp. Proc. No. 2600, 
alleging that the compromise settlement between the parties had been duly signed 
by them, a copy of which is attached to said manifestation, and in view of the 
unnecessary delay and the confusion that confront the parties, arising from the 
retention of Atty. Navarro of the original thereof and duplicate originals, 
petitioner Eduardo V. Elchico, 'is left no other alternative but to submit' the 
said compromise settlement for the approval by this Court, the pertinent 
portions of which read as follows:</p>
<p>'1. That all the assets of the estate of the decedent, Dr. Jose L. Elchico, 
shall be divided into fourteen (14) equal portions, after all the debts, taxes 
and other charges shall have been paid:</p>
<p>'2. That the fourteen (14) equal portions shall then be distributed as 
fellow's:</p></blockquote>
<ol><p>a. To Eduardo Elchico shall pertain two-fourteenths (2/14);</p><p>b. To Elena V. Elchico, Alfredo V. Elchico, Gloria E. Aldana, Concepcion E. 
Tobias, Dominador V. Elchico, Florencio V. Elchico, Leonor E. Almazan, Leticia 
E. Salvador, Estrella E. Serrano, Clara E. Casanas and Rosalinda L. de Pano, 
shall pertain one-fourteenths (1/14) each; and</p><p>c. To Paz E. Tolentino shall pertain one-twenty-eight (1/28) and Vicente and 
Visitation Elchico, shall pertain the remaining one-twenty-eight 
(1/28).</p></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>'3. In the interest of family peace, all charges and countercharges of all 
the parties in the above-entitled cases shall be as they hereby are considered 
withdrawn so that no one shall be held liable on the basis of said charges and 
countercharges;</p>
<p>'4. That pending the liquidation of the estate of the decedent Dr. Jose 
Elchico, the administration of the properties of the estate shall devolve 
jointly on Eduardo Elchico and Florencio Elchico;</p>
<p>'5. That pending the payment of the debts other charges of the estate, the 
management of the transportation business, the New Angat Transportation Company 
shall be, as it is hereby vested in:</p>
<p>Florencio Elchico, Manager, and<br>Eduardo Elchico, Treasurer-Cashier.</p>
<p>That all checks, disbursements and withdrawals shall be signed by Florencio 
Elchico, as manager, and countersigned by Eduardo Elchico, as Treasurer; 
Provided that in the event of mismanagement or maladministration or 
unjustifiable orders or instructions on the part of Florencio Elchico or 
mishandling of funds and/or unjustifiable refusal to countersign on the part of 
Eduardo Elchico, both of them shall be subject to recall, upon order of this 
Honorable Court.</p>
<p>'6. That Florencio Elchico and Eduardo Elchico shall exert all efforts to 
settle as soon as feasible all the charges against the estate, liquidate the 
business, and distribute and partition the estate in accordance with the 
proportions established in par. 2 hereof.</p>
<p>'7. This agreement shall take effect upon its approval by the Court.</p>
<p>'Whereof, the parties respectfully submit this compromise settlement to this 
Honorable Court, with the prayer that the same be approved and the 
above-entitled cases considered terminated and closed as to them.</p>
<p>'Manila for Pasig, Rizal, December 22, 1958.</p>

<p>"Considering the allegations of said manifestation, together with the written 
conformity of Florencio Elchico, and finding said compromise settlement to be in 
order the Court hereby approves said compromise settlement and enjoins the 
parties to faithfully comply with the terms and conditions, thereof. Pursuant to 
said compromise and pending the liquidation of the estate, Eduardo V. Elchico 
and Florencio Elchico are hereby appointed joint administrators of the estate, 
with powers, duties and obligations to perform their respective functions under 
the agreement and under the provisions of the Rules of Court. The administrators 
are ordered to exert utmost efforts to liquidate unpaid debts and obligations of 
the estate, including payment of the corresponding inheritance and estate taxes 
due on the, estate, and to submit a quarterly accounting of the income and 
expenses of the estate. </p>
<p>It is so ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p>On March 4, 1959, petitioners filed a motion to set aside said order 
alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that although said compromise settlement was 
signed by them, it was never intended to be delivered to become effective; that 
respondent Florencio Elchico obviously retained or smuggled a carbon copy 
thereof which he showed to the court on February 21, 1959; that their counsel 
(Atty. Emiliano R. Navarro) retained the deed of settlement with their full 
knowledge an4 consent, as they wanted a few alterations made thereon, due to 
subsequent discoveries, and they did not intend to settle on its original terms; 
and that they never authorized respondent Florencio Elchico to deliver said 
settlement to the court, nor were they notified of, nor present at said 
presentation of the settlement in court; however, this motion to set aside. 
"would not have been necessary had not Florencio Elchico. withdrawn his 
resignation and Attorney Salonga objected to his substitution." On March 9, 
1959, petitioners filed a supplemental motion, reciting supposed violations of 
the canons of professional ethics committed by Atty. Jovito R. Salonga, 
respondents' counsel, in securing the order in question. To this motion, 
respondents duly filed an opposition on' March 10, 1959, emphasizing that the 
compromise settlement was agreed upon in the presence of the court and later 
signed by all the parties, and that even the manifestation and urgent motion of 
the petitioners recognized the validity of the compromise settlement and were 
ready to abide by it, were it not for certain questionable. acts of Florencio 
Elchico, for which reason, they wanted him to be removed as co-administrator. 
Finally, respondents called attention to the fact "that there is no pretense on 
the part of movants (petitioners) that their signatures were obtained through 
deceit, violence or intimidation."</p>
<p>On July 7, 1959; respondent Judge issued an order denying said motion to set 
aside.</p>
<p>On July 15, T959, petitioners filed a notice of appeal.. They filed their 
appeal bond and record on appeal on July 17 and August 12, 1959, 
respectively.</p>
<p>On August 15, 1959, respondents filed an opposition to, said record on 
appeal, on y the grounds that (1) the order complained of is unappealable, as it 
embodies a compromise settlement which is <em>res judicata;</em> and (2) even if 
said order is appealable, said record on appeal is defective. To this 
opposition,. petitioners duly filed a reply on August 20, 1959. </p>
<p>On August 28, 1959, respondent Judge issued an order disallowing said record 
on appeal for the reasons, among others, that an order or judgment of a court 
approving a compromise voluntarily and freely entered into, is <em>res 
judicata</em> from the moment it is rendered, and that no evidence of any kind 
was offered to prove any of the legal grounds for revoking or setting aside ar 
compromise agreement or for altering any of its terms.</p>
<p>On September 11, 1959, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of said 
order to which, respondents filed an opposition on September 18,1959. On 
September 28, 1959, respondent Judge issued an order denying said motion for 
reconsideration, on the ground that petitioners failed to substantiate their 
allegations of fraud and connivance relative to the issuance of said order of 
February 23, 1959 which approved the compromise settlement in question, 
notwithstanding the opportunity afforded them to prove or substantiate the same. 
</p>
<p>Hence, this petition for mandamus.</p>
<p>Petitioners claim that the respondent Judge erred in disallowing their record 
on appeal.</p>
<p>We find no merit in this contention. As a rule, a judgment on a compromise is 
not appealable and is immediately executory, unless a motion is filed to set 
aside the compro- mise on the .ground of fraud, mistake, or duress, in which 
event, an appeal may be taken from the order denying the motion (De los Reyes 
<em>vs</em>. Ugarte, et al., 75 Phil., 505; Enriquez <em>vs</em>. Padilla, et 
al., 77 Phil., 373). The reason for the. rule is that when both parties enter 
into an agreement to end a pending litigation and request that a decision be 
rendered approving said agreement, it is only natural to presume that such 
action constitutes an implicit, as undeniable as an express, waiver of the right 
to appeal against the decision. For a party to reserve under the circumstances, 
the right to appeal against said decision, is to adopt an attitude of bad faith 
which courts cannot countenance (De los Reyes <em>vs</em>. Ugarte, 
<em>supra</em>). To be entitled to appeal from a judgment approving a 
compromise, a party must move, not only to set aside said judgment, but also to 
annul or set aside the compromise itself, on the ground of fraud, mistake, or 
duress, vitiating his consent to said compromise.</p>
<p>In the instant case, petitioners did not ask the lower court (and neither do 
they seek in their attempted appeal) to have the compromise settlement entered 
into by them with respondents set aside. Instead, they manifested their 
recognition of the due execution and validity of said compromise settlement, as 
well as their willingness to abide by it, if only respondent Florencio Elchico 
would resign as administrator of the estate subject thereof. Thus, Atty. 
Emiliano R. Navarro, acting as counsel for petitioners, manifested to the court, 
on February 24, 1959, that the only change he wanted in the terms of the 
compromise settlement was the removal of respondent Florentio Elchico as 
administrator of said estate and as manager of the estate's transportation 
business "if the group represented by him would so vote or decide", and that his 
clients (herein petitioners) "need not annul the order of this court (of 
February 23, 1959) referred to above", if such change could be made. And, in 
their very motion dated March 4, 1959, to set aside the order (of February 23) 
approving the compromise settlement, petitioners declared that "this motion 
would have been unnecessary had not Florencio Elchico (respondent) withdrawn his 
resignation (as administrator of the estate) and Atty. Salonga (respondents' 
counsel) objected to his substitution." In fine, petitioners seek to use their 
attempted appeal (which was disallowed, and which they pray this Court to compel 
the lower court, by mandamus, to allow) not to set aside the compromise 
settlement between them and respondents co-heirs, but only to compel an 
<em>alteration or amendment</em> of the same, by the removal of respondent 
Florencio Elchico as administrator of the estate and, if this is done, they 
would not even push through their motion to annul the order approving the 
compromise settlement. In this connection, the lower court observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is no dispute that the duplicate original submitted to this Court 
contains the terms of settlement agreed between the heirs. <em>No signature 
appearing thereon has been challenged by anyone as not genuine. There is no 
assertion that in affixing their signatures, or in the preparation and execution 
of the settlement, error, fraud, force or intimidation intervened. The said 
Compromise Settlement, signed by all the heirs, contains a formal petition 
stating that in their desire to settle amicably their differences and thereby 
preserve family unity and harmony in deference to the memory of the decedent, 
they have agreed to compromise the above-entitled cases, under the terms and 
conditions set forth therein, and asking this Court to approve the same and that 
'the above-entitled cases be considered terminated and closed as to them.'</em> 
That is precisely what this Court did in its order of February 23, 1959. The 
claim as to lack of notice regarding a settlement and petition, signed by all of 
the heirs including the movants themselves, is not therefore correct.</p>
<p>"The Court understands, however, that after the signing of the Compromise 
Settlement, certain iilejgpd irregularities on the part of Florencio Elchico 
pertaining to the management at the transportation business were supposedly 
discovered by the members of this group, and for this reason a motion to revoke 
or reconsider the order of February 23, 1959, approving the Compromise 
Settlement was submitted. <em>Movants' alleged discovery of certain 
irregularities imputed to one who used to be in their own group and who was 
appointed under the settlement as a co-administrator, as a result of their own 
insistence, does not justify the setting aside of the Compromise 
Settlement.</em> It is clear to this Court, that if Florencio Elchico has 
resigned from his position as Manager of the transportation business and as 
Administrator of the estate of the deceased, as the movanta themselves wanted in 
their urgent motion dated February 25, 1959, and as stated by them in their 
motion dated March 4, 1959, there would have been no controversy at all. <em>In 
other words, movants' quarrel is with Florencio Elchico, and not with the. 
Compromise Settlement. Their own urgent motion of Fdenary 25, 1959, seeking the 
replacement of Florencio Elchico as manager of the transportationbusiness and as 
co-administrator of the estate, on the strength of an alleged resignation from 
these positions", recognizes the binding effect of the Compromise Settlement, as 
otherwise there would be no point in the alleged resignation of Florencio 
Elchico. inasmuch as it was under this Compromise Settlement that Florencio 
Eichico was appointed.</em></p>
<p><em>"When the motion to revoke or reconsider the order of February 23, 1939 
was set for hearing and actually heard on June 27, 1959, no evidence of any kind 
was offered to prove any of the legal grounds for revoking or setting aside a 
compromise agreement or for altering any of its terms</em>. Attorney Mojica, who 
then represented the movants, merely submitted the said motion for the 
resolution of this Court, without argument and without proof, or even say, offer 
of proof. Before Atty. Mojica came into the picture, the attorney who 
represented the movants was Atty. Magpoc who asked this Court, in the presence 
of the movants, sufficient time to allow movants to propose for the 
consideration of the other heirs certain amendments to the Compromise 
Settlement. This was granted by this Court in its order of March 10, 1959, as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'By agreement of the parties, the hearing of all pending motions filed by 
Atty. Navarro is postponed until further assignment in order to give the movants 
time to settle amicably with the opposing party on amendments to the existing 
amicable settlement.'</p></blockquote>
<p>This Court was afterwards informed by the parties, through their attorneys, 
that the proposed amendments, were not acceptable to most of the heirs. </p>
<p><em>"It is clear then that if movants' desire was to oust Florendo Elchico, 
the setting aside of the settlement is hot the remedy. As pointed out by the 
oppositors, there is a provision in the'Compromise S&amp;tlement that disposes 
of this situation, sinde under Paragraph 4 thereof, in the event of 
mismanagement or maladministration on the part of Florencio Elchico, he is 
subject to ouster."</em> (Order of Aug. 28, 1959; italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, petitioners were given the opportunity to present evidence to 
substantiate their allegations of fraud and connivance in connection with the 
submission to, and approval bythe lower court of the compromise settlement in 
question,, but tjtey; failed to present the same. On this point,.the.iow;er 
i^drt stated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * On the scheduled hour of hearing of the Motion.for Reconsideration of 
-the Order of-August 28,. 1-959 on September IS, 1959, which was-set at the 
request of. movants, neither movaats nor their attorney appeared. However, Atty. 
Salonga, in representation of Eduardo Elehico, et al. (herein respondents) asked 
that the Motion be called again after the disposition of the other motions on 
the calendar of this Court to <em>give movants the opportunity to prove their 
allejgations of fraud found in said Motion. The alleged fraud relates to"the 
promulgation of the Order of this. Court of February 23, 1959 which approved the 
Compromise Settlement of December 22, 1958</em>. Acceding to the request, this 
Court called the 'aforesaid Motion at 9:20 o'clock. A certain Amado Tobias, who 
signed the motion as attorriey-in-fact of Concepcion E. Tobias, one of the 
heirs, appeared in Court with a pleading 'Reiteration of Opposition wherein 
counsel asked that two Motions of the adverse parties of August 26, 1959, 
regarding the sale of personal properties, be lield in abeyance 'pending 
resolution of the various pending incidents in these cases.' One of these 
pending incidents is a Motion for Reconsideration of the Order of August 28, 
1959. Notwithstanding this act, <em>Atty. Salonga (of Respondents herein) asked 
this Court to give a third opportunity to the movants tend their counsel, Atty. 
Malolos to substantiate their allegations of fraud and connivance as found in 
said Motion</em>, so that this Court may have the benefit of evidence in 
disposing of said Motion, The Opposition filed by Atty. Salonga, and signed by 
the latter's clients, challenging movants to prove their allegations was 
furnished Amado Tobias and transmitted to Atty. Malolos thru a letter dated 
September 19, 1959 of Atty. Salonga, and which the latter read into the records 
of this case. A copy of said letter, showing proof of service, has been 
furnished the Clerk of Court.</p>
<p>"This Court granted the motion of Atty. Salonga and thereupon set the hearing 
for Tuesday, September 22, 1959 at 8:30 in the morning. The records show that 
Atty. Malolos and the movants have been duly informed of this hearing, and the 
letter of Atty. Salonga of September 19, 1959 also informed Atty. Malolos of 
this fact.</p>
<p>"Again on September 22, 1959, neither the movants nor their counsel appeared, 
and instead a certain Urgent Motion dated September 21, 1959 was filed by Atty. 
Malolos for the immediate consideration of this Court. Said Urgent Motion 
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'That if undersigned counsel will be required to present evidence as Atty. 
Salonga demands in his opposition, undersigned counsel would like to have some 
time to consider whether or not to present evidence before the Court;</p>
<p>'That, in any event, undersigned counsel would be unable to present his 
evidence within such short notice; and</p>
<p>'That undersigned counsel has a previous engagement for 
tomorrow.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"The records show that since August 20, 1959, in a 'Reply to Opposition to 
Record on Appeal' Atty. Malolos has made the same serious allegations of fraud 
and connivance. Hence, his assertions that at such short notice, he cannot 
present evidence of fraud is not supported by his own acts, unless he made the 
allegation without taking into account any kind of supporting proof. <em>This 
Court also finds the position of movants inconsistent, since on the one hand 
they make before this Court serious allegations of fraud and connivance, but on 
the other hand assert that they still have 'to consider whether or not to 
present the evidence before the Court.'</em> For that reason, this Court has 
resolve to deny, as it hereby denies, the Urgent Motion for lack of merit, 
taking into account the fact that <em>movants have been given three occasions to 
make good their allegations of fraud and connivance, twice on September 19, 
1959, and a third time on September 22, 1959."</em> (Order of Sept. 11, 1959; 
Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The case of Enriquez <em>vs</em>. Padilla, et ah, <em>supra</em>, relied upon 
by petitioners as authority in support of their petition, is inapplicable to the 
case at bar, because in said case, petitioner assailed the validity of <em>the 
compromise itself</em> and not merely the judgment of the lower court based 
thereon. In the <em>Enriquez</em> case, it appears that the parties were 
summoned by then Judge Alfonso Felix of the Court of First Instance during the 
pendency of the action in his sala, for a conference regarding an amicable 
settlement of the case. The parties and their attorneys appeared, proposals and 
counterproposals were made, and then Judge Felix rendered a decision containing 
the agreement of the parties and approving the same. Petitioner then filed a 
motion for reconsideration, on the ground that "he had not in fact agreed to 
some of the conditions stated" in the stipulations on which the judgment was 
based. In the instant case, petitioners do not assail the fact that they freely 
entered into and signed the compromise settlement in question, and that they 
agreed to all its terms when they executed and signed the same.</p>
<p>At this juncture, it may be pointed out that we dismissed the petition for 
mandamus to compel the certification and approval of petitioner's record on 
appeal in the <em>Enriquez</em> case, not only because the allegations of fraud 
or mistake he made were found to be untrue, but also because his "motion for 
reconsideration did not appear to have pointed out any misstatements or 
inaccuracies in the decision; <em>it was limited to proposing new matters for 
incorporation into the decision</em>." In the present case, the same situation 
obtains. From the record, it is clear that petitioners' allegations of fraud and 
connivance are unproved, and their motion to set aside the order approving the 
compromise settlement, instead of pointing out inaccuracies or misstatements in 
said order relative to the terms of the compromise settlement, <em>is limited to 
proposing the change of respondent Florencio Elchico as administrator of the 
estate</em>, which change, if granted by the lower court or acceded to by 
respondents, would render it unnecessary (in the very words of petitioners 
themselves) for them to annul the said order approving the compromise 
settlement.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing the writ prayed for is denied, and the petition 
dismissed, with costs against the petitioners. So ordered. </p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Labrador, J.</em>, concurs in the result. </p>
<p><em>Writ denied, petition dismissed.</em></p></div>
