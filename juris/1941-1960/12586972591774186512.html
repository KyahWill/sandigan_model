				<H3>PEDRO TOLENTINO, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. RAMON TORRES, IN HIS CAPACITY AS ACTING GOVERNOR OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, RESPONDENT.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The respondent is the incumbent Provincial Governor of Negros Occidental, 
substituting the former governor Ramon Torres, who in June 1953 sent to each of 
herein thirty petitioners, the members of the Provincial guard, letters of the 
following tenor:
<blockquote>
<p>"You are hereby notified that your services as Private, Provincial Guard in 
the Provincial Government of Negros Occidental is no longer needed effective at 
the close of office hours today."</p></blockquote>
<p>The petitioners allege that the removal was made by respondent Torres without 
authority of law, because under Republic Act No. 557 the authority to remove 
members of the provincial guards belonged to the provincial board, to be 
exercised only after preferment of charges, notice and hearing to afford the 
person concerned full opportunity to make his defense. They further aver that 
their removal was motivated by political considerations, they being under 
suspension of being partisan of the opposing faction in the locality. They ask 
that after due hearing the respondent be commanded to reinstate them and to pay 
moral and exemplary damages.</p>
<p>In his answer the respondent denied political motivation saying the true 
causes for removal were:</p>
<ol><li>Petitioners' lack of civil service eligibility excepting petitioner Jose 
Real; 
</li><li>The temporary nature of their appointment; 
</li><li>The expiration of the terms of office of the herein petitioners (except Jose 
Real) in September 30, 1952; 
</li><li>Petitioners were unruly, abusive, and undisciplined. </li></ol>
<p>Respondent further explained that Jose Real failed to meet the condition of 
his appointment: satisfactory report of physical fitness from the Government 
Insurance System. </p>
<p>Replying to the answer, petitioners assert that the reasons advanced by 
respondent were a mere afterthought by which he attempted to justify the 
"political purge" perpetuated by him.</p>
<p>Attached to the record are appointments of petitioners. All of them are 
expressly called "temporary". Excepting five, all expressly stipulate that the 
appointment shall not extend beyond September 30, 1952. These, therefore, 
expired on such date. For this Court to grant their petition would be tantamount 
to requiring respondent to extend to each of them another appointment, which we 
cannot do, having no power to control the respondent's discretion in the 
selection of personnel.</p>
<p>The appointments of Mario Pirano, Reynaldo Valencia, Pedro Barcillo and 
Jovito Bacalangco were temporary too, but fixed no definite date of expiration. 
They simply were effective "until replaced by an eligible." However they were 
expressly made subject to section 682 of the Administrative Code which reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 682. <em>Temporary and emergency employees</em>,â€”Temporary appointments 
without examination and certification by the Commissioner of Civil Service or 
his local representative shall not be made to a competitive position in any 
case, except when the public interests so require, and then only upon the prior 
authorization of the Commissioner of Civil Service; and any temporary 
appointment so authorized shall continue <em>only for such period not exceeding 
three months</em> as may be necessary to make appointment through certification 
of eligibles, and in no case shall extend beyond thirty days from receipt by the 
chief of the bureau or officfc of the Commis- sioner's certification of 
eligibles; * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore the legal validity of their temporary appointments expired after 
three months, earlier than their so-called removal in June 1953.</p>
<p>As to Jose Real, his appointment was, by the Civil Service "Authorized as 
temporary pending report from the Government Service Insurance System as to the 
appointee's physical and medical examination." There is no question that up to 
the "removal" no such report has been made, because petitioner Jose Real failed 
to submit to a physical and medical examination. And yet it must be clear that 
hid appointment was approved subject to his passing such physical examination, 
within a reasonable time, of course. As he has not passed it, we cannot see our 
way clear to require his reinstatement, he having failed to meet a condition 
attached to his appointment.</p>
<p>On this point we have not overlooked petitioner's argument that such 
examination could not have been a condition <em>sine qua non</em> of his 
appointment, it being only for the insurance benefits, because he could not have 
qualified as patrolman civil service eligible if he had not been found to be 
physically fit. However, we have noticed that he took such examination in 1948 
and this appointment was made in 1952. The condition of his health may have 
deteriorated after the passage of four years; and for a guard, health is most 
essential.</p>
<p>From the foregoing we must conclude that the case for petitioners is not one 
wherein respondent excluded1 them from the use or enjoyment of an office to 
which they were entitled at the time of their petition. (Section 3, Rule 67.) 
Hence, their request for the writ of mandamus must be denied, with costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador</em> and <em>Reyes J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Writ denied.</em></p></div>
