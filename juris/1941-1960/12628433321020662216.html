				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This an appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; the order of the Court of First Instance of Rizal&nbsp; (Pasay City Branch)&nbsp; dated December 20,&nbsp; 1956, denying" petitioner-appellant's petition for execution of the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Wage&nbsp; Administration Service (WAS) dated July 12,&nbsp; 1955 in WAS Case&nbsp; No. C-3271 "awarding&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; petitioner-appellant and against respondent-appellee the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P11,618.96 representing unpaid overtime compensation&nbsp; due the former."<br><br>The facts&nbsp; in this case are not disputed.&nbsp; Petitioner Leonardo V. Figueroa&nbsp; was a bus&nbsp; inspector of the Saulog Transportation,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; for several&nbsp; years.&nbsp; He&nbsp; allegedly worked&nbsp; from&nbsp; 6:00 a.m.&nbsp; to&nbsp; 6:00&nbsp; p.m. each day of duty with a break&nbsp; of 15 minutes for&nbsp; lunch time.&nbsp; After&nbsp; his separation from the service, he filed with&nbsp; the WAS a claim&nbsp; for unpaid overtime compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The WAS&nbsp; notified&nbsp; respondent-appellee Saulog Transportation, Inc. of the&nbsp; claim and requested&nbsp; it to appear during the hearing. Despite the notification, however, respondent-appellee never appeared, and Figueroa was allowed to present his&nbsp; evidence after which the WAS issued its so-called "decision" sought to be enforced, at the&nbsp; same time requesting&nbsp; respondent-appellee to pay&nbsp; petitioner the sum of P11,816.96 within five (5) days.<br><br>On October&nbsp; 22, 1956, that is, more than one year&nbsp; from the&nbsp; date of the rendition of the so-called decision of the WAS,&nbsp; Figueroa filed with the trial court&nbsp; his petition for the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of a writ of execution of the decision of the WAS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent-appellee opposed the&nbsp; petition on the ground that the trial court was not authorized to execute or enforce decisions of the&nbsp; WAS, that said&nbsp; decision of the WAS sought to be enforced was illegal, issued without authority of law, unenforceable not only by the WAS but also by the Court of First Instance; and that said decision of the WAS was not <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata,</span> because that body was not a competent court.<br><br>On December 20, 1956 the trial court issued the order appealed from, denying&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for execution&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; it "has&nbsp; no&nbsp; power&nbsp; to&nbsp; execute the decision sought to be executed.<br><br>The case of Venancio&nbsp; Potente <i>vs.</i> Saulog Transit, Inc.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> G.&nbsp; R. No.&nbsp; L-12300, promulgated on&nbsp; April 24, 1959,&nbsp; is quite&nbsp; similar to&nbsp; the present case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff&nbsp; Potente in. that case was also a bus inspector of the same respondent transportation&nbsp; company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Potente filed&nbsp; a claim with the WAS&nbsp; for the&nbsp; collection&nbsp; of overtime compensation.&nbsp; The Acting Chief of the Wage Protection Division recommended approval of the&nbsp; claim,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was approved by the&nbsp; Acting Chief of the WAS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over a year later, Potente filed with the Court, of First Instance of Rizal, a petition for&nbsp; execution&nbsp; alleging that the&nbsp; decision of the WAS on his claim had become final&nbsp; and executory, no appeal having been taken therefrom&nbsp; by the company, and praying that a&nbsp; writ of execution be issued in his favor to&nbsp; satisfy his claim of P8,359.75,&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; approved by&nbsp; the WAS. Without either notice to&nbsp; the company, or&nbsp; hearing, the trial court issued&nbsp; an order granting the petition and ordering the&nbsp; issuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution.&nbsp; On appeal to us, we&nbsp; reversed&nbsp; the appealed order&nbsp; of the trial court.&nbsp; Thru&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; Concepcion, we said:<br><blockquote>"The issue before us is&nbsp; whether a 'decision' of the WAS, finding that Potente&nbsp; is entitled to recover P8,359.75, from his former employer, by way of unpaid overtime compensation, may be ordered executed by a. court of justice, without an ordinary action for the recovery of said&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; money, and&nbsp; without&nbsp; a decision&nbsp; of such court sentencing the employer to pay the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; amount: It is obvious to us that the&nbsp; answer must be negative.<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>"In other words,&nbsp; the WAS&nbsp; may cause the employer to satisfy the unpaid wages through mediation,&nbsp; arbitration, or&nbsp; court action,. and by no other means.&nbsp; It has an authority to render a 'decision'— in the sense in which this term is&nbsp; used in legal parlance—on the claim for wages,&nbsp; except insofar as&nbsp; it has to&nbsp; determine whether, in its&nbsp; opinion, the Claim&nbsp; is meritorious,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a condition precedent to the institution, before&nbsp; 'any competent court,'&nbsp; of an&nbsp; ordinary 'action' for the recovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of money it considers due to the claimant.&nbsp; But, then no writ&nbsp; of execution shall issue, except when&nbsp; the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">judgment rendered by said court</span>—after&nbsp; due notice and hearing, as demanded by&nbsp; the tenets of due process and provided in the Rules of Court-shall have become final and executory."<br></blockquote>On&nbsp; the basis&nbsp; of the aforementioned&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of this Court in Potente&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Saulog Transit,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>,&nbsp; there is no alternative but to affirm&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of dismissal of the trial court.<br><br>Our attention is being&nbsp; called to the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Brillantes <i>vs.</i> Castro, 99 Phil., 497; 56 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., (29)&nbsp; 4621, in support of appellant's theory that&nbsp; a decision of the&nbsp; WAS,&nbsp; if not appealed, becomes final, conclusive and executory.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is, however, a great difference&nbsp; between&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of Brillantes and the present&nbsp; case.&nbsp; In that case of Brillantes, the parties therein formally—<br><blockquote>"entered into&nbsp; an&nbsp; Arbitration&nbsp; Agreement&nbsp; whereby they&nbsp; agreed<br><br>"1. That&nbsp; they&nbsp; submit their&nbsp; case&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Wage&nbsp;&nbsp; Administration Service for investigation;&nbsp; and "2. That they bind themselves to abide by whatever&nbsp; decision this Office may render on the case and that they&nbsp; recognize said decision to&nbsp; be final and conclusive"; that in accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; said&nbsp; agreement, the&nbsp; parties, assisted by their respective&nbsp; counsel, adduced evidence before the Wage Administration Service;"<br></blockquote>In the present case, there was never such an agreement, and as already stated, respondent-appellee&nbsp; never appeared before the WAS&nbsp; or&nbsp; attended any of its hearings.<br><br>In view of the foregoing,&nbsp; the order&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against petitioner-appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.
