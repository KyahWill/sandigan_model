				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Emilio Advincula seeks a&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of certiorari, to annul certain orders of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Negros&nbsp; Occidental.<p></p><p>Said&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; was, on November 22, 1954, appointed, special&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate of&nbsp; his deceased&nbsp; wife, Josef a Lacson Advincula, in special proceeding No. 3245 of said court.&nbsp;&nbsp; In due course, he was, on February 12, 1955, appointed&nbsp; regular&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; of said&nbsp; estate.&nbsp; After Advincula&nbsp; had qualified&nbsp; as such,&nbsp; the brothers&nbsp; of the deceased, who left&nbsp; no issue, submitted to the court, for allowance,&nbsp; a document purporting to be her last will and testament.&nbsp; Petitioner opposed the probate&nbsp; thereof upon the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; it did&nbsp; not bear the signature&nbsp; of the deceased; that the signature thereon, if hers, was secured through fraud and duress;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that,. the instrument had not been executed with the requisite formalities.&nbsp; On may 4, 1955, respondent Enrique Lacson, one of the brothers of the deceased, filed a motion praying that he be appointed administrator of said estate, in lieu of petitioner herein,&nbsp; for the&nbsp; reason that said respondent is the executor named in the aforementioned alleged will.&nbsp; On or about May 16, 1955, Attys. Jose&nbsp; Y. Torres and Antonio Lozada, as&nbsp; counsel for Advincula, filed an opposition to said motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the latter was called for hearing&nbsp; on May 18,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; Atty. Lozada&nbsp; was served, in open court, copy of an amended&nbsp; motion, of respondent Lacson, for change of&nbsp; administrator,&nbsp; dated May 14, 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; alleged therein, in addition to&nbsp; the ground set forth in the first motion:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"5. That the present administrator&nbsp; is incompetent, incapable and unsuitable to the discharge of the trust, he&nbsp; being foreign to the estate, and&nbsp; without&nbsp; changing&nbsp; or removing&nbsp; him&nbsp; as such&nbsp; would be disastrous to&nbsp; the estate and&nbsp; to the&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; named in the will&nbsp; of the decedent."</p></blockquote><p>Atty. Lozada asked&nbsp; a postponement of the hearing upon the&nbsp; ground that Advincula's main counsel,&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Torres, was in Manila,&nbsp; but his request was denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, after hearing the&nbsp; argument of&nbsp; opposing&nbsp; counsel,&nbsp; the court, presided over by respondent, Honorable Jose Teodoro,&nbsp; Sr., Judge, issued, on the same date (May&nbsp; 18, 1955),&nbsp; an order the&nbsp; pertinent parts&nbsp; of which read:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The Court,&nbsp; after hearing&nbsp; the&nbsp; oral&nbsp; arguments of both parties, finds the motion for postponement not well-taken and hereby denies the same;&nbsp; and finding the motion dated May&nbsp; 4, 1955 as amended by&nbsp; the&nbsp; amended&nbsp; motion&nbsp; dated&nbsp; May&nbsp; 14, 1955, well-founded&nbsp; and the opposition&nbsp; thereto&nbsp; dated&nbsp; May 16,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; not&nbsp; well-founded,&nbsp; said motion is hereby granted.&nbsp; </p><p>"Wherefore, in&nbsp; the interest of justice and for the preservation of the property for the heirs, the appointment of Emilio Advincula as administrator is hereby revoked and in his stead,&nbsp; the oppositor, Enrique A. Lacson, is hereby appointed administrator of&nbsp; this intestate estate,&nbsp; and same may qualify by filing a&nbsp; bond in the&nbsp; sum of P5,000&nbsp; and&nbsp; taking and subscribing&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; oath of Office.&nbsp; Once said&nbsp; Enrique A, Lacson&nbsp; has qualified,&nbsp; let&nbsp; letters of administration&nbsp; issue in his favor.&nbsp; </p><p>"The former administrator, Emilio Advincula, is hereby ordered to submit within&nbsp; ten&nbsp; (10)&nbsp;&nbsp; days&nbsp; from receipt&nbsp; hereof,&nbsp; his&nbsp; final account covering the entire period of his administration and should it&nbsp; appear&nbsp; that any deficiency has been, incurred&nbsp; by him during his incumbency, his bond&nbsp; shall answer for said&nbsp; deficiency."</p></blockquote><p>Thereupon, Lacson&nbsp; gave&nbsp; the requisite&nbsp; bond, letters of administration&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued to&nbsp; him, and he&nbsp; tried to t take possession of the estate of&nbsp; the deceased,&nbsp; A reconsideration of said&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; May&nbsp; 1$,&nbsp; 1955, having been&nbsp; denied by another order, dated May 30, 1955, petitioner instituted the&nbsp; present&nbsp; action&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari,&nbsp; against&nbsp; Lacson&nbsp;&nbsp; and Judge Teodoro,&nbsp; to&nbsp; annul&nbsp; his&nbsp; aforesaid orders of May 18 and 30, 1955, upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that&nbsp; the same&nbsp; were&nbsp; issued&nbsp; with grave abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; filing of a&nbsp; bond by Advincula, we issued, as&nbsp; prayed for&nbsp; in&nbsp; his petition, a writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction restraining respondent Lacson and his agents from&nbsp; interfering, molesting and harassing the&nbsp; petitioner in the administration of the estate of the deceased,&nbsp; during the pendency of this case.</p><p>The writ of certiorari prayed for is in order.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacson's appointment, in&nbsp; lieu&nbsp; of Advincula, as administrator&nbsp; of the estate of Josefa Lacson Advincula,&nbsp; is predicated upon the fact that the former is&nbsp; named executor in the alleged will of said deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; provision therein to this effect cannot be enforced,&nbsp; however, until after said&nbsp; document has&nbsp; been&nbsp; allowed to&nbsp; probate, for&nbsp; section&nbsp; 4 of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 79 of the Rules of Court provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>When a will has&nbsp; been proved and allowed</em>, the court shall issue letters testamentary thereon to&nbsp; the&nbsp; person&nbsp; named as&nbsp; executor therein, if&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; competent, accepts the trusts,&nbsp; and gives&nbsp; bond as required by these rules." (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>Besides, the discovery of a document purporting to&nbsp; be the last will and&nbsp; testament of&nbsp; a deceased, after the appointment of an administrator of the estate of the latter, upon the&nbsp; assumption&nbsp; that&nbsp; he or she&nbsp; had died&nbsp; intestate, does&nbsp; not<em> ipso facto</em> nullify the&nbsp; letters of administration already&nbsp; issued&nbsp; or even authorize the&nbsp; revocation thereof, until the alleged will has&nbsp; been&nbsp; "proved and&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; by the court."&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 83,&nbsp; section 1, of the&nbsp; Rules of Court,&nbsp; is plain and explicit on this point.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"If&nbsp; after letters of&nbsp; administration&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; granted&nbsp; on&nbsp; the estate of&nbsp; a decedent as if he had died intestate, his will is proved and allowed by the&nbsp; court, the&nbsp; letters of administration&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be revoked&nbsp; and all powers&nbsp; thereunder&nbsp; cease,&nbsp; and the administrator shall&nbsp; forthwith&nbsp; surrender&nbsp; the&nbsp; letters to the court, and render his account within such&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp; as the court directs.&nbsp; Proceedings for the issuance of letters testamentary or of administration under the will shall be as herein before&nbsp; provided."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>The amended motion for change of administrator endeavored to&nbsp; justify the removal&nbsp; of&nbsp; Advincula "by alleging that&nbsp; he&nbsp; is "incompetent, incapable&nbsp; and unsuitable to the discharge&nbsp; of the trust,&nbsp; <em>he&nbsp; being foreign&nbsp; to the&nbsp; estate</em>" of the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; By holding, in its order of May 18, 1955, that said motion is "well-founded"—with nothing, absolutely nothing&nbsp; else, to&nbsp; indicate the basis of this conclusion— respondent Judge has impliedly adopted the line of argument followed in the above quoted allegation of the amended motion to change administrator.&nbsp; Said argument is, however,&nbsp; devoid&nbsp; of merit.</p><p>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; untenable&nbsp; from the&nbsp; viewpoint of logic and&nbsp; experience, because a stranger to deceased may be competent, eapable&nbsp; and&nbsp; fit to administer her&nbsp; estate, in much&nbsp; the same&nbsp; as a member of her&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; family could be incompetent, incapable and unfit to&nbsp; do so.&nbsp; At any rate, Advincula is not a stranger, either to her or to her estate, he being her surviving spouse and, as such, one of&nbsp; her forced heirs&nbsp; (Arts. 887, 888, 892,&nbsp; 893,&nbsp; 894,&nbsp; 897 to 900, and 995 to 1001,&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp; of the Philippines), whether she died testate or intestate.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is' more,&nbsp; he is <em>prima facie</em>&nbsp; entitled to one-half of all&nbsp; property&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the authority of the administrator of said estate, apart from his share of the other half thereof, as heir of the deceased, for "all property of the marriage is presumed to&nbsp; belong to the conjugal partnership"—of which he is its administrator&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 165,&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code of the&nbsp; Philippines) "unless&nbsp; it be proved that it pertains exclusively&nbsp; to&nbsp; the husband or to the wife" (See Articles 160 and 185, Civil Code of the Philippines).&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, Advincula has not been found guilty&nbsp; of any specific&nbsp; act&nbsp; or&nbsp; omission&nbsp; constituting one of the&nbsp; legal grounds,&nbsp; enumerated in Rule 83, section 2, of the Rules of Court,&nbsp; for the removal&nbsp; of&nbsp; an executor or administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; it is clear that respondent Judge exceeded his&nbsp; jurisdiction in removing Advincula and&nbsp; appointing&nbsp; Lacson as&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; of the estate of&nbsp; the deceased Josefa Lacson Advincula.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; orders&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent Judge, dated&nbsp; May 8 and&nbsp; 30, 1955, are reversed, and&nbsp; the writ of preliminary injunction issued in this&nbsp; case hereby made permanent, with costs against respondent Enrique A. Lacson.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Jugo, Bautista Arbgelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p><p></p></div>
