				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Cayetano Mangahas and Mariano de los Santos Mangahas (Cases Nos. 
742 and 744 of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan) were charged with
 treason.  With their consent both defendants were tried jointly.  After
 trial they were found guilty of the crime charged and sentenced to 
suffer 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal, the 
accessories of the law, and each to pay a fine of P10,000 and the costs.
  Both have appealed.
  <p>    At about 11 o'clock in the morning of 13 December 1944 
(Saturday), Jose Perez, a runner of the guerrillas operating around 
Victory Hill in Norzagaray, province of Bulacan, appeared at the house 
of Martin de la Merced, commanding office of the guerrillas, and 
informed him that about 30 armed Makapilis raided Lawang, a section of 
the town of Norzagaray, and apprehended several guerrilla members.  Upon
 hearing the report Martin went down, joined other guerrillas, ran 
toward the bushes outside the town to escape from Makapilis.  While his 
wife Enriqueta was looking around the house a second runner by the name 
of Julian Payumo came and informed her that the house of Captain Basilio
 Leonardo had already been raided, and not long after a third runner by 
the name of Lucio Ocampo came and told her that the Makapilis were in 
front of the municipal building.  She left her house and went to another
 across the street from where she could see what they were going to do 
in her house.  The Makapilis, among whom were Cayetano Mangahas, Mariano
 de los Santos Mangahas and Francisco Castillo, arrived, surrounded the 
house, some of them went up; and took and brought to the garrison of the
 Makapilis near the municipal building foodstuff intended for the 
guerrillas at Victory Hill, consisting of 5 sacks of rice, 2 cans of 
salted beef, a basketful of camote and another of tomatoes, a small bag 
of salt and a half sack of sardines, salmon and corned beef.</p>
  <p>    Enriqueta B. de la Merced and Engracia de la Cruz testified to 
the foregoing overt acts.</p>
  <p>    On 30 December 1944 five persons, among whom were the two 
defendants, came to the house of Moises Legaspi at Norzagaray, 
apprehended and brought him to the garrison of the Makapilis.  Three 
days after his arrest, or on 2 January, his wife Purita Ramos, together 
with her children the eldest of whom was Matias Legaspi, 11 years old, 
went to the garrison of the Makapilis and there saw her husband, but 
since then he has not returned and has not been seen.</p>
  <p>    Purita Ramos and Matias Legaspi testified to the foregoing 
overt acts.</p>
  <p>    The foregoing evidence supports counts Nos. 2 and 3 of the 
information against Cayetano Mangahas and counts Nos. 3 and 4 of the 
information against Mariano de los Santos Mangahas.</p>
  <p>    In the morning of 29 December 1944 a group of armed Makapilis, 
among whom were the two defendants, took and carried away rice, shoes, 
helmet, clothes and anything they could get hold of in the house of 
Primo S. Cruz at Norzagaray, Bulacan, and at the same time apprehended 
him and, together with other persons whose hands were tied, was brought 
to the San Jose garrison where Japanese soldiers were stationed and 
since then he has not returned and has not been seen.  A similar tragedy
 befell Artemio Nicolas who on 30 December 1944 was taken from his house
 in Norzagaray by the defendants, was tied up and brought to the 
poblacion and then to the San Jose garrison and since then he has not 
returned and has not been seen again.</p>
  <p>    By their own admission the defendants are Filipino citizen.</p>
  <p>    The arrest of Primo S. Cruz and Artemio Nicolas, who as alleged
 in the information was shot to death by the Japanese while attempting 
to escape at the time when the Americans began bombing, cannot be deemed
 sufficient to constitute treason for lack of two witnesses, because the
 arrest of Primo S. Cruz is established only by the testimony of his 
widow Maria S. Cruz and that of Artemio Nicolas only by the testimony of
 his widow Virginia Boluran.  Nevertheless, it is a proof of adherence 
to the enemy.</p>
  <p>    There is no merit in the argument that because there is no 
evidence to show that the defendants acted as informers or that they 
were responsible for the arrest of Moises Legaspi (counts No. 2 against 
Cayetano Mangahas and No. 3 against Mariano de los Santos Mangahas), the
 evidence is insufficient to support a conviction for treason.  There is
 no doubt that the two defendants were present when they arrested Moises
 Legaspi at his house on 30 December 1944.  A mere denial by Cayetano 
Mangahas that he was with those who arrested Moises Legaspi is not 
sufficient to outweigh the testimony of Purita Ramos and Matias Legaspi 
who pointed to the appellants as among the five Makapilis who 
apprehended Moises Legaspi.</p>
  <p>    On the day his father was taken by the Makapilis from his house
 Matias Legaspi was eleven years old and was 16 years old when he 
testified and being then a fifth grade student his senses could perceive
 and transmit those perceptions to others.  The trial court gave him 
credence.  After reading the transcript of his testimony a disregard 
thereof would be unwarranted.</p>
  <p>    The claim that there is no proof of adherence to the enemy is 
without merit.  The acts of arresting guerrillas, commandeering 
foodstuffs, doing sentry work, drilling in the plaza, going around the 
town carrying firearms, and the fact that before the outbreak of the war
 they were members of the Ganap Party and in the latter period of the 
Japanese occupation of the Makapili organization, are more than 
sufficient proofs of adherence to the enemy.</p>
  <p>    Cayetano Mangahas testifies that he and his brother Mariano de 
los Santos Mangahas were arrested by the Japanese on 25 December 1944 
for they were suspected also of being guerrillas; and upon that it is 
argued that they could not have been among the group of 30 Makapilis 
that raided the house of Martin de la Merced on 13 December 1944.  The 
uncorroborated testimony of Cayetano Mangahas cannot prevail over the 
testimony of Enriqueta B. de la Merced and Engracia de la Cruz who on 
that occasion saw the defendants among the raiders.</p>
  <p>    In People <i>vs.</i> Predilla, G. R. No. L-4407, 25 March 1952,
 we said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>    In some cases lack of instruction was taken into account to 
mitigate treason;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in others
 it was not<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In People v. 
Cruz, G.R. No. L-2236. 16 May 1951, lack of instruction was not taken 
into consideration to mitigate treason, but as it appeared that the 
defendants had not taken part in the killing of the victims the minimum 
period of the penalty provided by law was not disturbed.  The evidence 
does not show that the appellant took part in the killing of the 
victims.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the 
appellants.</p>
