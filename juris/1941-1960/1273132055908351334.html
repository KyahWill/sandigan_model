				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Ruben Rodriguez, Leonardo Alvarez, Ernesto Desiderio and Felipe Tan alias 
Peping were charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila with the crime of 
murder. Felipe Tan not having been arrested, trial proceeded only with respect 
to the other 3 accused. But in the course of the hearing, Ernesto Desiderio was 
discharged as a defendant, on motion of the Fiscal, and used as Government 
witness. After trial, the Court found Ruben Rodriguez and Leonardo Alvarez 
guilty of the crime charged and sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of 
<i>reclusion perpetua</i>, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased 
Eulogio Tagle in the sum of P6,000.00, and each to pay 1/4 of the costs. From 
this judgment of conviction, Ruben Rodriguez and Leonardo Alvarez appealed and 
in this instance their counsel maintains that the lower Court erred:<p></p>
<ol><li>In giving full faith and credence to the testimony of Ernesto Desiderio y 
Malonzo coming as it was from a polluted source;<br><br>
</li><li>In disregarding the defense of appellants which was supported by documentary 
and oral evidence; and<br><br>
</li><li>In convicting the defendants. </li></ol>
<p>On January 30, 1957, counsel for the defendants submitted a motion for new 
trial based on newly discovered evidence consisting of an affidavit of Ernesto 
Desiderio retracting from the testimony he had given in the lower Court, action 
on which motion was deferred by resolution of this Court of January 31, 1957, 
until the case be considered on the merits.</p>
<p>The facts of the case as well as the findings and conclusions of the trial 
Judge after weighing and considering the evidence produced at the hearings, are 
clearly and correctly stated in the decision appealed from. We copy from said 
decision the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Felipe Tan and Leonila Tan are brother and sister. Eulogio Tagle was 
Leonila's husband, while Rodriguez is the son of Isabel Joven, a cousin of 
Felipe and Leonila. Rodriguez and Alvarez are brothers-in-law, Rodriguez' wife 
being Alvarez' sister. Eduvigis Rodriguez, nicknamed Edeng, is a sister of Ruben 
Rodriguez and lives at No. 1667 Sande Street, Tondo, Manila.</p>
<p>Eulogio Tagle and Leonila Tan lived in Lucena, Quezon, after liberation, but 
prior to March, 1953, Tagle left Lucena and went to live, first in Baliuag, 
Bulacan, and later in Manila. He sometimes stayed at No, 1481 Franco Street in 
this city occupied by his wife's relatives and sometimes at No. 733 Constancia 
Street occupied by Florentine) Malihan. his mother's brother.</p>
<p>Tagle, obviously the victim of foul play, was found dying in a room on the 
second floor of house No. 1481 Franco on the morning of March. 28, 1953. 
Patrolman Villanueva of Precinct 3, Manila Police Department, had taken him to 
the North General Hospital. The records of the hospital show that he was 
admitted there at 5:30 o'clock that morning. (See Exhibit B.)</p>
<p>Detective Urbano Walker arrived at the house on Franco Street after the 
injured man was taken to the hospital and found a mat still .spread on the 
floor, a pillow and a mosquito net, all stained with blood. Also in the room 
were an army kitchen knife and two galvanized iron pipes. The knife and one of 
the pipes were verified in the Criminal Investigation Laboratory of the Manila 
Police Department to be stained with human blood. There could be no doubt that 
they were the lethal weapons. </p>
<p>Tagle died in the North General Hospital a few minutes after 6 o'clock on the 
same morning of March 28. Dr. Mariano B. Lara, chief medical examiner of the 
Manila Police Department, who examined and performed an autopsy of his dead 
body, found one stab wound on the neck, another stab wound on the lower border 
of the left jaw, and four lacerated wounds on the head. For convenience, Dr. 
Lara at the trial identified the stab wounds as Nos. 1 and 2 and the lacerated 
wounds as Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6. The following are the pertinent portions of Dr. 
Lara's report, marked Exhibit B:</p>
<p align="center">"MISCELLANEOUS EXTERNAL WOUNDS:</p>
<p>(1) Stab wound, antero-lateral upper neck, left, piercing thru skin and neck 
muscles and lateral left portion of oro-pharynx (2 cm. x 12 cm. deep).</p>
<p>(2) Stab wound, lower border, left lower jaw, piercing skin and subcutaneous 
tissues. (2.2 cm. x 0.5 cm.).</p>
<p>(3) Lacerated wound, right lateral region, eyebrow, with periorbital tissue 
hematoma. (Size of lacerated wound, 2 cm. X 0.6 cm.).</p>
<p>(4) Lacerated wound, left eyebrow region, with left pcriorbital tissue 
hematoma. (Size of lacerated wound, 3.5 cm. x 1 cm.).</p>
<p>(5) Lacerated wound, scalp, mastoid region of head, right. (Size of lacerated 
wound, 2 cm. X 0.9 cm.).</p>
<p>(6) Lacerated contusion, upper and lower lips.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>CAUSE OF DEATH:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Severe shock and profuse external hemorrhage due to head and neck stab and 
blunt combined injuries, fracturing the skull, piercing the left oro-pharynx and 
causing extensive subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages in the 
brain'.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Lara testified that the wounds described as Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 were 
necessarily fatal. </p>
<p>The police made no progress towards the identification of Tagle's killer or 
killers until more than one year after his death. "Whether the team of Manila 
detectives headed by Lieut. Baldomero Tiamsec went to Baliuag, Bulacan, on April 
17, 1954, on a tip that Ernesto Desiderio was one of the killers, or whether 
they were called after Desiderio surrendered is not clear. What the record 
clearly discloses is that Desiderio surrendered to his uncle, Sgt. Moises 
Desiderio of the Baliuag police force, who turned him over in Baliuag to Lieut. 
Tiamsec and his men.</p>
<p>Desiderio immediately gave a verbal confession to Lieut. Tiamsec and 
implicated Kuben Rodriguez, Leonardo Alvarez and Felipe Tan. Rodriguez and 
Alvarez were promptly arrested upon the strength of Desiderio's identification. 
Tan had disappeared.</p>
<p>Desiderio's version of the killing of Eulogio Tagle and the events leading to 
it is as follows: Upon Rodriguez' invitation, he and Rodriguez came to Manila on 
March 24, 1953, in the morning, and went directly to the house of Rodriguez' 
sister Edeng on Sande street. Tan arrived at Edeng's house shortly after their 
arrival and told Rodriguez that he could find no one to liquidate Eloy -'titira 
kay Eloy'. He proposed that Rodriguez undertake the job- 'Mabuti pa kayo na ang 
tumira,' and Rodriguez replied, 'I will think it over. You will know my answer 
within a week.' Desiderio and Rodriguez went back to Baliuag the same morning. 
</p>
<p>Desiderio and Rodriguez, accompanied by Alvarez, returned to Manila on March 
27, 1953, in the afternoon. As the three sat at the rear of the bus during the 
trip, Rodriguez proposed that Desiderio and Alvarez do the job-'Kayo na ang 
tumira kay Eloy.' Alvarez readily agreed.</p>
<p>The three got off the bus at Divisoria, then went to No. 1481 Franco street 
in Tondo. Rodriguez conversed with an old man in the street in front of the 
house, then with his two companions took a taxi to No. 733 Constancia street in 
Sampaloc. Tagle was there. He invited them in and served them beer and soft 
drinks. </p>
<p>Night had descended upon the city when Rodriguez, Alvarez, and Desiderio left 
Constancia with Tagle and returned in a taxi to the house at No. 1481 Franco 
street. Tagle spread a mat in a room on the second floor and lay down. But 
Rodriguez, Alvarez and Desiderio did not go to bed; instead they left and went 
to a store about 100 meters from the house. There Rodriguez, Alvarez and 
Desiderio whiled away their time eating1 and drinking.</p>
<p>They returned to the house on Franco at about midnight. Rodriguez told 
Desiderio to occupy a rocking chair in the outer room, saying, 'Magbantay ka 
dian sa pinto.' Then he and Alvarez went into the room where Tagle had earlier 
spread a mat.</p>
<p>Desiderio was awakened at about 4:30 o'clock in the morning, March 28, by a 
noise and a groan and heard Tagle say, 'Ruben, bakit mo ako ginanito?' Rodriguez 
and Alvarez ran uut of the room, their clothes stained with blood, as Desiderio 
was to observe later. Rodriguez pulled Desiderio as he ran out saying, 'Let us 
go.' They went directly to Tan's house a short distance away, where Rodriguez 
and Alvarez changed their blood-stained clothes. The three returned to Baliuag 
the same morning.</p>
<p>Florentino Malihan corroborated Desiderio's testimony on material points. He 
testified that Rodriguez, Alvarez and Desiderio arrived at his residence at No. 
753 Constancia late in the afternoon of March 27, 1953; that Tagle served them 
beer, soft drinks; that it was night when they left in a taxi with Tagle. He 
added that he learned of Tagle's death from his wife the next day.</p>
<p>Alvarez denied that he knows Felipe Tan. He denied that he knew Eulogio Tagle 
or that he was ever at 1481 Franco or 733 Constancia street. He denied taking 
part in the killing. He testified that he was at home in Batohan, San Miguel, 
Bulacan, on March 26, 27, 28 and 29, 1953. Desiderio was also in Batohan 
according to him, because he eloped with Rosalinda Dimaapi on March 26, and 
stayed in his (Alvarez') father's house. About noon of March 27 he, his father 
David Alvarez, Desiderio and Rosalinda attended a pabasa in the house of Aurelio 
Tagalo, his father-in-law, in Barrio Santa Inez, San Miguel, about two or three 
kilometers from his house in Batohan. They returned to Batohan about midnight. 
On March 28, at the request of his father who feared that Desiderio's elopement 
might cause him trouble because Rosalinda was a minor, he asked Desiderio to 
leave Batohan. Desiderio left Batohan with Rosalinda on March 29, and Alvarez 
claims that Desiderio testified against him because he harbors ill feeling 
towards him for sending him and Rosalinda away.</p>
<p>Rosalinda and Aurelio Tagalo corroborated Alvarez on the elopement, her 
continuous presence with Alvarez and Desiderio in Batohan from March 26 to 29, 
and the pabasa on March, 27, 1953.</p>
<p>Rodriguez, too, denied any participation in the killing. He denied coming to 
Manila with Desiderio and meeting Tan in Edeng's house on Sancte street on March 
24, 1953, and his denial was corroborated by Eduvijes Rodriguez, nicknamed 
Edeng. He denied coming to Manila with Alvarez and Desiderio on March 27, 1953, 
or being with Alvarez, Desiderio and Tagle either at Constancia or at Franco on 
that day. Corroborated by Antolin Torres, he testified that he and Torres worked 
during the entire month of March, 1953, hauling rice for Fernando Miranda from 
Bahay Pare to the town of Baliuag.</p>
<p>Rodriguez and Alvarez thus deny any part in the killing of Eulogio Tagle or 
in the events leading to it and rely on the defense of alibi to establish their 
innocence. But their denial avails them nothing in the face of the clear and 
positive testimony of Ernesto Desiderio and Florentino Malihan which points to 
them as the persons who killed Tagle (U.S. vs. Bueno, 41 Phil., 447; People vs. 
Borbano, 76 Phil., 702; People us. Macalindong, 76 Phil, 719, and in the absence 
of any showing that in giving their testimony Desiderio and Malihan were 
actuated by improper motive. (People vs. Niem, et al., 75 Phil., 668, 670.) No 
such motive has been shown. True, Desiderio gave his testimony only after he was 
discharged from the information, but in judging his credibility it should be 
remembered that immediately after his arrest and long before he knew that he 
would one day become a witness for the prosecution, he gave a verbal confession, 
which, was later reduced to writing (Exhibit J), naming his co-accused as his 
companions in crime. His testimony on the witness stand is in substance a 
repetition of his written extrajudicial statement. With the testimony of 
Malihan, it is entitled to full faith and credit. (U. S. vs. Pajarillo, 19 
Phil., 288; People vs. De Otero, 51 Phil., 202; People vs. Borbano, supra).</p>
<p>Coming to their defense of alibi, it should be stated that alibi is at best a 
weak defense and cannot prevail over the testimony of truthful witnesses. The 
reason is that alibi is easy of fabrication (People t's. Badiilla, 48 Phil., 
718), especially between parents and children, between relatives and friends, 
and even between those who are not so related. (People vs. De Asis, 61 Phil., 
384; People vs. Japitana, 77 Phil., 175). Indeed, even in those cases where 
proof of the alibi is well supported by the testimony of witnesses, the alibi 
would not be credited when the identity of the accused, as in this case, as the 
persons who committed the crime is fully established! by clear, explicit and 
positive testimony. (U. S. vs. Pascua, 1 Phil., 31; U. S. vs. Hudieres, 27 
Phil., 4-5). All the witnesses through whose testimony the accused in the 
present case would establish their alibi are their close relatives and friends, 
except Rosalinda Dimaapi who has a reason to so testify as to contradict , 
Desiderio who, she admitted on the witness stand, abandoned her and their child 
and shifted his interest to another woman. (T.s.n., pp. 321-322.)</p>
<p>The accused were not without a powerful motive to kill Tagle. As the husband 
of Leonila Tan and the father of her five living children, Tagle was neglectful. 
He was shiftless; he did not live with her and their children or support them. 
Prom the lips of his wife, she gave him P2,000.00 with which to go to business, 
but he squandered the money in two months, then returned and asked for more. And 
when he finally left Lucena to live in Baliuag, then in Manila, he continued to 
ask support from her. (t.s.n. pp. 334- &amp; 342.) As if to emphasize his 
misconduct, lie maltreated her, according to Felipe Tan when first asked 
Rodriguez to do away with him.</p>
<p>The evidence of the defense that Tagle was killed by the brother of the 
person Tagle killed deserves no serious thought. Leonila's testimony on the 
point has all the earmarks cf a rehearsed testimony. She came to court with 
prepared notes of the points on which she was to testify, as shown on Exhibit O 
which she surrendered to the fiscal in the course of the latters 
cross-examination of her. Canuto Masino, a resident of San Pablo City, testified 
that on a date he could not remember, in a barrio of Tiaong, Quezon, be heard 
one Piciong- tell fellow Huks that he killed Tagle because Tagle killed his 
brother. This testimony is fantastic and cannot discredit the evidence of the 
prosecution on the identities of Table's killers. The court is convinced that 
Tagle was killed for his neglect of his family and his misconduct towards his 
wife and not because he killed a man in Quezon. The case arising from the 
killing was settled to the satisfaction of the victim's family. Tagle paying the 
family P3,000.00 as settlement, (t.s.n. pp. 335-337.) </p>
<p>The information alleges evident premeditation, treachery, the accused taking 
advantage of their superior strength and employing means to weaken the defense, 
and consideration of a price, reward or promise as circumstances attending the 
killing. But treachery has not been satisfactorily established. No one except 
the killers witnessed the assault, and Dr. Lara admitted the possibility that 
the victim and the assailants could have been standing and facing each other at 
the time of the assault. The noise that awakened Desiderio and Tagle's remarks 
shortly before Rodriguez and Alvarez ran out of the room could mean that the 
fatal assault was preceded by an exchange of words.</p>
<p>The same observations apply to the circumstances of the accused allegedly 
taking advantage of their superior strength and employing means to weaken the 
defense of the victim. Too, evidence is totally lacking that Alvarez or 
Rodriguez received any price or reward or was given any promise for killing the 
deceased. It was Desiderio who received P115.00 from Rodriguez, for what, the 
record is not clear. </p>
<p>Evident premeditation, however, is satisfactorily established by the 
evidence. Felipe Tan proposed the killing to Rodriguez on March 24, 1953. 
Rodriguez promised to consider the proposal and to make his decision within a 
week. He must. have considered the proposal long and seriously and finally made 
up his mind to kill Tagle, because he came to Manila on March 27 and killed 
Tagle the next day. On March 27, Alvarez, too, agreed to take part in the 
killing. When he helped Rodriguez kill Tagle the following day he had had 
sufficient time for serious reflection and full opportunity to weigh the 
consequences of his act. The killing was murder, qualified by evident 
premeditation, with no aggravating or mitigating circumstances to modify the 
penalty."</p></blockquote>
<p>The arguments adduced in appellants' brief cannot overcome the conclusions of 
the trial Judge, with whom We concur, as to the guilt of appellants of the crime 
charged in the information, although We likewise agree with the Solicitor 
General that the commission of the crime was attended by the aggravating 
circumstances of nighttime, to which it may possibly be added the aggravating 
circumstance of dwelling, because the deceased was murdered in the house at No. 
1481 Franco street in Tondo, which was one of the two houses (the other being at 
No. 733 Constancia, Sampaloc) where the deceased used to live and have as his 
place of abode during his stay in Manila. Therefore, appellants should be 
sentenced in this case to the supreme penalty of death there being no mitigating 
circumstance to offset the aggravating circumstances attending the commission of 
said crime, but this penalty cannot be imposed upon appellants for lack of the 
necessary votes required by law to that effect.</p>
<p>Coming now to appellants' motion' for new trial, We have to deny the same for 
the reason that, as observed by the lower Court, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"immediately after his arrest and long before he knew that lie would one day 
become a witness for the prosecution, he gave a verbal confession which was 
later reduced to writing (Exh. J), naming his co-accused as his companions in 
the crime. His testimony on the witness stand Is in substance a repetition of 
his written extrajudicial statement. With the testimony of Malihan, it is 
entitled to full faith and credit (U. S. vs. Pajarillo, 19 Phil., 283; People 
vs. De Otero, 51 Phil., 202; People vs. Borbano, 76 Phil., 
702)."</p></blockquote>
<p>Affiant Ernesto Desiderio surrendered voluntarily to his uncle, Sgt. Moises 
Desiderio of the Baliuag" Police Force, to whom he admitted his participation in 
the commission of the crime, and that is why Sgt. Desiderio turned his nephew in 
Baliuag over to Lt. Tiamsec and his men before whom Ernesto Desiderio again gave 
the verbal confession above referred to (Exh. J), implicating Ruben Rodriguez, 
Leonardo Alvarez and Felipe Tan. It is easy to understand that after Desiderio 
was relieved from responsibility for the murder of Eulogib Tagle, he would now 
submit and yield to the pressure that appellants or their families may have 
possibly exerted upon him, but We cannot give to his retraction any value or 
consideration. Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, with 
costs against the appellants. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, </i>and
