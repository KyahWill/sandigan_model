				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>An appeal taken by the Republic  of the  Philippines from a resolution of the Court of First Instance of Manila, dated January 15,  1959,  the  dispositive  part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"WHEREFORE,  the Court hereby grants the amended petition and directs the Local Civil  Registrar of Manila to change the entries in the hirth certificate of George C. Uy in the following manner:</p>
  <p>(1)  Name  of father,  from  Chua Kee  iin to  Chua Tian  Sang alias John Uy;</p>
  <p>(2)  Name of mother, from Helen Tan to Juliana Yu;</p>
  <p>(3)  Residence of both parents,  from 410 San Fernando Street, Manila, to 629  Soler, Manila;</p>
  <p>(4)  Age of the father, from 25 to 37 years, and the age of the mother from  23 to 31 years;</p>
  <p>(5)  Birthplace  of the father from  Amoy, China to  Chinkang, China,  and the birthplace of  the  mother  from Sta. Cruz, Manila to Manila;</p>
  <p>(6)  Religion  of both parents from Roman Catholic to Confuscian;</p>
  <p>(7)  Number  of children born to this mother including present birth,  from 1 to 6; and</p>
  <p>(8)  Number  of children born to this mother  now living,  from 1 to 5."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 18, 1957, petitioners Chua Tian Sang",  alias John Uy, and  Juliana Yu filed, with the  Court  of First Instance of Manila,  a petition,  dated  October  11,  1957, alleging that they are husband and  wife  residing at No. 410 San Fernando Street, Manila; that "on January 20, 1956, George C. Uy was born  to the petitioners at St. Luke's Hospital, Magdalena  Street, Manila,"  that  "due to  an honest mistake,  it  was erroneously entered in the birth certificate of 3aid George  C.   Uy that his parents are the  spouses Chua Kee Lin and  Helen Tan,  who are only  his God-parents' who wish to adopt the child; that "the  error  was recently discovered;" and that "to  avoid confusion, it is very important and necessary"  that the Local Civil Registrar  of  Manila be ordered "to amend and/or correct the entry in the birth certificate of George C. Uy, with respect  to the alleged parents  of said child, to the true and correct names and personal circumstances of the real parents of the said child, the petitioners herein."</p>
<p>The Solicitor General moved to  dismiss the petition, but the lower  court decided  to  consider  the merit of  said motion  upon presentation of the evidence for  the  petitioners.  Under date of July 15, 1958, petitioners filed an amended petition, with specification of tlie particulars to be amended in the birth certificate of George Â£. 1fly.  Jlie prayer in said amended  petition reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore,  your petitioners pray that, .after due hearing, an order be issued, ordering the Local Civii Registrar of Manila to amend and/or correct the entry in the Birth Certiiicate of George C. Uy as follows:</p>
  <p>"1. <em>To change the  name of the  father Chua Kee Lin to Chua Tian Sang alias  John Uy;</em></p>
  <p>"2. <em>To change  the name of  the mother Helen Tan to Juliana Yu;</em></p>
  <p>"3. <em>To  change the residence  gft  both  parents from 410 San Fernando  St., Manila to 629 Soler St., Manila;</em></p>
  <p>"4.<em> To change the  age at the last birthday of the father ftom 25 years to 37 years; </em></p>
  <p>"5. <em>To change the  age at the  last birthday of the mother from 23 years to, 81 years; </em></p>
  <p>"6. <em>To change the birthplace of  the father from Amoy,  China to Chinkang, China; </em></p>
  <p>"7. <em>To  change  the birthplace of  the mother  from Sta.  Cruz, Manila, to Manila;</em></p>
  <p>"8.<em> To change the religion  of both parents from Roman Catholic to Confuscian; </em></p>
  <p>"9.<em> To change  the number of children born to the mother including present birth from one (1) to six (6); and </em></p>
  <p>"10. <em>To change the number of children of the mother now living from one  (1)  to  five (5)."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After  due  hearing, the lower court issued  the order complained. of,  granting  the. relief  prayed . for in said amended petition,  upon  the authority of  Article  412 of the Civil Code of the Philippines.   Hence, this appeal by the Solicitor  General,  which   is based mainly  upon  Ty Kong  Ting vs. Republic (94 Phil., 321; 50 Off. Gaz., 1077). Black vs. Republic (J04 Phil., 848; 56 Off, Gaz. [30] 4752), andAnsaldo  vs. Republic (102 Phil., 1046; 54  Oft. Gaz. [22]  5886).   Upon  the  other  hand,  petitioners-Appellees maintain that  the lower court was justified in issuing said order, upon the ground that the corrections therein directed are not  substantial, but merely clerical, harmless and innocuous in  character.</p>
<p>Appellees' pretense is devoid of  merit.  The  changes sought affect paternity and filiation,  and, hence, the status of the child.   What is  more, it appears from the order appealed from that Chua Kee Lin  and Helen Tan were reported to be the parents of George C. Uy, in pursuance of an agreement reached with petitioners herein, so that the alleged inaccuracy of the data appearing  in his birth certificate was due, not to an error or mistake, but to a deliberate attempt to  pervert the truth in a  public document.  Referring  to Article 412 of  the Civil  Code  of the Philippines  reading:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No entry  in  a civil  register shall be  changed  or  corrected, without a judicial order."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we have already held that "what was contemplated therein are  mere  corrections  of mistakes  that are clerical  in nature, and  not those which may affect the  civil  status or the nationality or citizenship of the persons involved;" that, "if it refers to a  substantial  change which affects the  status or  citizenship of a party, the  matter  should be threshed out in a proper action depending upon the nature of the issue involved" (Ty Kong Ting  vs. Republic, 94 Phil., 321; 50 Off. Gaz.,  1077);  that,  in  order to  be subject to  correction  under  said provision the  error involved must be "one that is visible to  the eyes or obvious to the understanding.  It is an error made by a clerk or transcriber a mistake in copying or writing" (Black vs Republic, <em>supra</em>; and that Article 412 authorizes no more than "harmless  and innocuous changes,  such as  correction  of a name that is clearly misspelled, occupation of the parents, etc." (Ansaldo vs. Republic, <em>supra</em>.)   Obviously, the case  at bar does not come within the purview of said rulings.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the  resolution  appealed  from is  hereby reversed and set aside, and the petition  herein dismissed, with costs against the petitioners.   It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Gutierrez  David, Paredes,</em> and  <em>Dizon, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
