				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Challenging&nbsp; the Leyte&nbsp; court's&nbsp; decision, which&nbsp; allows Tan Bee&nbsp; Chiu alias Alfonso Tan&nbsp; to&nbsp; be naturalized, the Solicitor-General submits&nbsp; three objections,&nbsp; to wit:<br><ol><li>Lack of jurisdiction, because Tan Bee did not reside in Leyte&nbsp; but lived&nbsp; in&nbsp; Cebu;&nbsp; 2. His&nbsp; witnesses who lived in Leyte,&nbsp; could not&nbsp; possibly speak of his good conduct and&nbsp; morality; 3.&nbsp; No proof&nbsp; that&nbsp; Tan Bee Chiu was a citizen&nbsp; of Nationalist&nbsp; China and, therefore, eligible&nbsp; to Philippine citizenship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></li></ol>We&nbsp; have examined the record,&nbsp; and we found no good ground to sustain the first two&nbsp; objections. As to the first, the oppositor itself admits that petitioner was&nbsp; born&nbsp; in Hindang, Leyte,&nbsp; that&nbsp; therein&nbsp;&nbsp; he finished the elementary&nbsp; and&nbsp; secondary courses, that&nbsp; he worked in his father's store&nbsp; in the locality until he left for Cebu&nbsp; in 1954—one year before he filed this application—to be employed as&nbsp; cashier at P300.00 a month and that thereafter, he spent his weekend vacations&nbsp; with&nbsp; his parents in&nbsp; Hindang.&nbsp; This shows&nbsp; his legal&nbsp; residence&nbsp; in Leyte.&nbsp; His work in Cebu as a cashier did not, by itself, Republic of the Philippines<i> vs.</i> Tan Bee Chiu change his residence, where his conduct and his declarations&nbsp; evinced no intention&nbsp; to abandon it,&nbsp; considering specially that he returned to Hindang&nbsp; whenever his occupation permitted.&nbsp; Many doing business in Manila have preserved&nbsp; their residence in their respective native towns. There is&nbsp; no doubt that&nbsp; one&nbsp; person may actually&nbsp; live and work&nbsp; in one&nbsp; place,&nbsp; and&nbsp; yet&nbsp; continue&nbsp; to have his&nbsp;&nbsp; legal residence in his place of birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>This Court has ruled that&nbsp; residence&nbsp; of applicants for naturalization,&nbsp; means&nbsp; legal residence&nbsp; or&nbsp; domicile—not&nbsp;&nbsp; necessarily physical presence,&nbsp; actual continuous&nbsp; stay in&nbsp;&nbsp; one town or&nbsp; province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>In connection&nbsp; with Tan Bee's stay in&nbsp; Cebu since 1954, the competency of his character witnesses is put in issue.&nbsp; Being residents&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Leyte, how could&nbsp; they,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; asked,&nbsp; ascertain his conduct and&nbsp; activities in Cebu?&nbsp; It must&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp; remembered&nbsp; that these witnesses knew&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; Leyte since&nbsp; 1940 and 1942 and&nbsp; had plenty of&nbsp; time&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; inform&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; as to&nbsp; his&nbsp; behaviour and&nbsp; habits.&nbsp; They&nbsp; further declared before&nbsp; the&nbsp; court that&nbsp; after&nbsp; Tan Bee had gone to Cebu they <span style="font-style: italic;">saw him on week-ends</span> when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; came back home on&nbsp; furloughs from that city.&nbsp; To qualify,&nbsp; the witnesses need not have seen&nbsp; the applicant every day and every week.<br><blockquote>"* * * The fact that witness had not&nbsp; actually seen petitioner on other occasions&nbsp; does not mean that he&nbsp; cannot testify as to the&nbsp;&nbsp; moral conduct of petitioner.&nbsp; If the petitioner had really been unworthy, his unworthiness would have come home to the knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp; of the witness, not from observations of the petitioner himself but&nbsp;&nbsp; from other persons who could have called the&nbsp; attention of&nbsp; the witness as to such unworthiness. It is not those who have&nbsp; actually&nbsp;&nbsp; and continuously seen&nbsp; a&nbsp; person&nbsp; alone&nbsp; that can testify as to his&nbsp; good conduct and behaviour.&nbsp; In a&nbsp; community&nbsp; the conduct and behaviour of a person becomes known more from his reputation than from actual&nbsp; observation.&nbsp; * * *"&nbsp; (Yu Tong&nbsp; Su <i>vs.</i> Republic, 101 Phil., 169; 53 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.
