on September 28, 1937, pray for a command from this Court calculated to compel 
the lower court to execute its order of October 2, 1940, which reads as

<p>No appeal has been taken against the foregoing order by any party.</p>
<p>From July 1, 1940, to December 31, 1941, the administratrix, respondent Mary 
McDonald Bachrach, made the payments as ordered. According to respondents, the 
total amount paid amounted to P40,250. The monthly allowances or advances due 
from January 1, 1942, to July 31, 1945, were not paid. The total amount is 
P32,500 or P21,500 for Sophie M. Seifert and P10,750 for Elisa Elianoff. 
Payments were resumed from August, 1945, to January, 1947. Petitioners have been 
demanding from respondent Mary McDonald Bachrach the payment of the monthly 
allowances from January 1, 1942, to July 31, 1945, but respondent refused to 
pay. As alleged in her memorandum, the executrix "decided to stop the payment", 
among several reasons, in view of the "inconsiderate, unappreciated and unkind 
attitude" of petitioners, the increasing burden on Mrs. Bachrach's usufruct, and 
improbability of reimbursement to the estate of the payments and of the return 
to the executrix of the usufructuary value of said allowances.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1947, petitioners filed with the lower court a petition for 
the issuance of a writ of execution ordering, on the authority of the order of 
October 2, 1940, the administratrix to pay the allowances for February, 1947, 
and those in arrears for the period comprising January 1, 1942, to July 31, 
1945, and that in case the administratrix should fail to pay the above amounts 
within 24 hours after receipt of notice, the Hongkong and China Banking 
Corporation be ordered to deliver to attorneys for petitioners the total sum of 
P33,000, to be withdrawn from the funds that the administratrix has on deposit 
in said bank in the name of the estate of E. M. Bachrach.</p>
<p>The petition was denied on February 27, 1947. On March 4, 1947, petitioners 
filed a motion for the reconsideration of said order. On March 14, 1947, the 
motion for reconsideration was denied. Not satisfied with the orders of February 
27, and March 14, 1947, of the lower court, petitioners filed with us the 
petition in this case.</p>
<p>For a proper understanding of the controversy we quote hereunder the text of 
the will of E. M. Bachrach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I, E. M. Bachrach, a naturalized American citizen from the State of New York

<p>"<em>Fifth:</em> I hereby choose and appoint my beloved wife, Mary McDonald

<p>"<em>Seventh:</em> It is my express wish that the business of the Bachrach

dissolved, disposed of, or discontinued for a period of at least FIVE years 
after my death, unless the company is conducted at a losing basis; and the 
payment of the bequests, legacies and gifts above mentioned shall be made from 
my income and estate as shall least disturb or disrupt the business of the 
Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., as a going concern;</p>
<p>"<em>Eighth:</em> It is my wish that upon the death of my beloved wife, Mary 
McDonald Bachrach, all my estate, personal, real and otherwise, and all the 
fruits and usufruct thereof which during her life pertained to her, shall be 
divided as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One-half (½) thereof shall be given to such charitable hospitals in the 
Philippines as she may designate; in case she fails to designate, then said sum 
shall be given to the Chief Executive of these Islands who shall distribute it, 
share and share alike to all charitable hospitals in the Philippines excluding 
those belonging to the governments of the Philippines or of the United 
States;</p>
<p>"One-half (½) thereof shall be divided, share and share alike by and between 
my legal heirs, to the exclusion of my brothers.</p></blockquote>
<p>"Before signing this Last Will and Testament, I hereby declare that I have 
read and understood each and every provision hereof, and hereby publish and 
declare the same as my Last Will and Testament.</p>
<p>"Done in this City of Manila, this 3d day of December, 1935.</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "E. M. BACHRACH"</p></blockquote>
<p>The following facts can also be taken into consideration: (1) A report filed 
by respondent Mary McDonald Bachrach on January 24, 1941, giving in detail a 
list of properties belonging to the heirs of E. M. Bachrach, shows a total value 
of P1,069,494.34; (2) The administratrix has in her possession the sum of 
P351,016.91; (3) The administratrix has made "all the transfers or is proceeding 
with the transfers in the name of the estate of E. M. Bachrach for the heirs of 
the said E. M. Bachrach," of the properties whose total value according to the 
last project of partition is P1,069,494.34; (4) Among the properties in the 
possession of the administratrix is the sum of P351,016.91 which has already 
been adjudicated to, and belongs, although still <em>pro indiviso</em>, to the 
heirs of the deceased E. M. Bachrach, from which, according to petitioners, the 
monthly allowances due to petitioners should be paid in accordance with the 
order of October 2, 1940; (5) Petitioners allege that the monthly allowances due 
them shall not be taken from the one-half of the properties amounting to 
P1,069,494.34 which is the share of the charitable hospitals, but from their 
respective participations in said property; (6) The Solicitor General agreed to 
the payment of the monthly allowances as per his conformity signed at the bottom 
of the petition of September 15, 1940; (7) Respondent Mary McDonald Bachrach has 
made advance payments to charitable institutions amounting to P22,000 from the 
participation of the charitable hospitals without prior authority from the 
probate court; (8) On May 27, 1947, the Solicitor General filed a manifestation 
undoubtedly for the protection of one-half of each and every asset of the estate 
of the deceased E. M. Bachrach, belonging to the charitable hospitals, in 
accordance with the eighth clause of the will; (9) On June 9, 1947, petitioners 
answer by stating that their monthly allowances shall not be taken from the 
shares or participation belonging to the charitable hospitals but from 
petitioner's participation or interest in the other one-half of the estate of E. 
M. Bachrach which belongs to the heirs of the deceased; (10) On June 11, 1947, 
the Solicitor General filed an additional manifestation in which it expresses 
its satisfaction over the statement made by petitioners on June 9, 1947.</p>
<p>There is no question that the monthly allowances provided in the order of 
October 2, 1940, were agreed upon by all the parties for the maintenance of the 
four sisters of the deceased E. M. Bachrach, including herein petitioners. In 
the order of February 27, 1947, Judge Conrado Barrios found that the 
heirs-petitioners Sophie M. Seifert and Elisa Elianoff "are in dire need of 
funds for support."</p>
<p>Several reasons are advanced by respondents in their opposition to the 
compliance with and execution of the order of Judge Abeto dated October 2, 1940. 
We shall pass upon the important ones.</p>
<p>They allege that the conformity given by Mary McDonald Bachrach to the 
petition of September 16, 1940, as well as the payments made by her of the 
monthly allowances under the order of October 2, 1940, "was an act of pure 
liberality on her part and, therefore, could not be construed as giving rise to 
any obligatory relations between said respondent executrix and the parties 
receiving said monthly allowances." The allegation is unacceptable. Conformity 
is consent. According to a universal law, recognized in our Civil Code, consent 
is the source of obligations. That respondent has given her conformity as an act 
"of pure liberality on her part" does not change the nature of the legal effect 
of the consent given. The commitment she made with her conformity cannot be 
dismissed upon the ground that it was given as "pure liberality" or for any 
other motive. Provided the consent was freely given, and regardless of the 
motive behind the act, it gives rise to all proper legal effects. The conformity 
or agreement of all the parties to the petition of September 16, 1940, gives it 
the nature of a contract. The contracting parties are bound to respect and to 
abide by the commitments in said contract. The contract cannot be lightly 
dismissed. Respondent's allegation that Mary McDonald Bachrach had given her 
conformity without any consideration, is belied by her own allegation to the 
effect that she gave said conformity as "an act of pure liberality on her part." 
Pure liberality is a consideration recognized by the Civil Code. No other 
consideration is entertained in donations. The contract in this case has the 
added force and solemnity of having been approved by the order of Judge Abeto of 
October 2, 1940. The contract has been elevated to the category of a judgment. 
Its enforceability depends not only on the good faith of the parties but on a 
legal and executory order issued by a competent court. While respondent Mary M. 
Bachrach cannot ignore her plighted word, she has absolutely no right to 
consider the order of October 2, 1940, as a mere scrap of paper. Otherwise, if 
their orders could be simply ignored, challenged or taken with scorn, there is 
no use for the existence of courts.</p>
<p>Respondents alleged that "there is no provision in the will of the deceased 
E. M. Bachrach or in any statute requiring" the payment of the monthly 
allowances provided in the order of October 2, 1940. But is there any 
prohibition for the parties to agree in the payment of said monthly allowances? 
Was there any reason for the lower court to withhold its approval to the 
agreement? The allegation seems to imply an argument based on the denial of the 
basic right of the parties to enter into any kind of agreement neither forbidden 
by law nor against public morals.</p>
<p>The respondents alleged that the order of October 2, 1940, "was not intended 
to be a judicial mandate but merely an authority for the respondent Mary 
McDonald Bachrach to do certain acts which she could not perform under the law 
or under the provisions of the will of the deceased E. M. Bachrach without 
judicial authority." The allegation finds no support in the order wherein Mary 
McDonald Bachrach is "authorized and instructed forthwith to pay" the monthly 
allowances in question. Instructed means commanded. The inclusion of the last 
word negatives respondent's allegation. Mary McDonald Bachrach did not appeal 
against the order. She cannot now deny validity to the command involved in the 
word "instructed." Besides, an "order", the title of the document, cannot be 
anything other than a mandate, compulsory by nature.</p>
<p>Impairment of her usufruct is also alleged by the administratrix. How can she 
now complain of the alleged impairment after alleging that she gave her 
conformity to the agreement, the basis of the order of October 2, 1940, as "an 
act of pure liberality on her part?" Was she not the owner of her usufruct? 
Could she not give away her usufruct or any part of it in favor of any person? 
If she disposed of a portion of said usufruct for the benefit of the sisters of 
her deceased husband, without being subject to compulsion, or fraud, or mistake, 
but freely and conscientiously, there is no reason for her to complain now. When 
she gave her conformity to the petition upon which the order of October 2, 1940, was issued, she did it undoubtedly in the same spirit of charity with which 
her deceased husband, E. M. Bachrach, had written his will. She deserves 
commendation for the beauty of her act in seconding the attitude of helpfulness 
of her husband towards the petitioners. Charity is the choicest flower of the 
human spirit. While the late E. M. Bachrach and his widow were concerned in 
helping charitable hospitals, they did not forget the needy sisters of the 
deceased, as charity must start at home. We are not willing to help respondent 
withdraw now what she has given to petitioners voluntarily and with noble spirit 
of liberality.</p>
<p>Because petitioners perfected an appeal against the order of the lower court 
granting the administratrix the authority prayed for in her petition of February 
19, 1947, to sell "the portion of the estate destined for charity," respondents 
complain that petitioners have improperly and against the principles of orderly 
procedure, split the order of October 2, 1940, and simultaneously perfected an 
ordinary appeal from a part of the order of February 27, 1947, and filed the 
present petition for a writ of <em>mandamus</em> in connection with the other 
part. The complaint is groundless. The present petition refers to the execution 
of the order of October 2, 1940, while the appeal in question has been filed 
against the order of February 27, 1947, granting the executrix's petition dated 
February 19, 1947, the basic pleading in the record on appeal of March 31, 
1947.</p>
<p>The last important argument of respondents is that no execution can validly 
be issued in connection with the order of October 2, 1940, because of the 
<em>moratorium</em> provided in Executive Order Nos. 25 and 32, which is still 
in full force and effect. The allegation cannot be entertained. The monthly 
allowances provided in the order of October 2, 1940, are not among the money 
obligations for which a <em>moratorium</em> has been decreed. The allowances in 
question are advances of an inheritance. They have been paid and are to be paid 
to petitioners as advances of the respective shares in the estate of their 
deceased brother E. M. Bachrach. They are not debts. The <em>moratorium</em> 
refers to debts. It is enough to look at the title of the executive orders in 
question.</p>
<p>Section 1 of Rule 39 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Execution as of right</em>.—Execution shall issue upon a final judgment 
or order upon the expiration of the time to appeal when no appeal has been 
perfected."</p></blockquote>
<p>The provision is mandatory. There is no question that the order of October 2, 
1940, has become final. Upon the facts in this case and the law applicable 
thereto, it is the ministerial duty of the lower court to order the execution of 
October 2, 1940. Failure to comply with said ministerial duty is a proper case 
for <em>mandamus</em>.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, we grant the petition, and the respondent lower court 
is ordered to proceed with the execution of its order of October 2, 1940, and to 
issue the proper writs.</p>

<p><strong>BRIONES, M.:</strong></p>
<p>Es incuestionable el derecho de las peticionarias a los adelantos devengados 
y acumulados durante la guerra, pero no cobrados a causa de la misma. Habiendose 
autorizado y ordenado el pago de dichos adelantos en virtud de auto judicial de 
fecha 2 de Octubre, 1940, previa conformidad expresa de la administradora 
recurrida, todos los beneficios y derechos derivados del mismo a favor de las 
peticionarias son validos y efectivos, por lo menos hasta que dicho auto se 
revoque o modifique mediante procedimientos apropiados al efecto. No hay nada en 
autos que demuestre que ese auto haya dejado alguna vez de estar en vigor. 
Consta, por el contrario, que cuando despues de la liberacion de Filipinas de la 
ocupacion japonesa las peticionarias trataron de cobrar lo que se les debia en 
virtud del referido auto, este tenia plena fuerza y efectividad.</p>
<p>Asi que sin necesidad de discutir si el auto en cuestion ha creado un estado 
juridico firme e irrevocable, o se halla en todo tiempo sujeto al control del 
Juzgado, susceptible de revocacion, alteracion o modificacion de acuerdo con las 
circunstancias y condiciones variables de la testamentaria, resulta evidente que 
no habiendose revocado o modificado la orden, la misma debe hacerse efectiva con 
efecto retroactivo. Lo contrario seria una mala practica procesal. El buen orden 
de los tramites y procedimientos judiciales exige que las ordenes validas y 
existentes se hagan efectivas.</p>
<p>Carece de importancia el que esto se llame orden de ejecucion, o lo que sea. 
Lo importante es que el Juzgado de cumplimiento a la orden; y si no lo hace, se 
le puede compeler mediante <em>mandamus</em>.</p>
<p>En el presente caso es posible que la administradora y usufructuaria tenga 
derecho a pedir que se le releve o dispense de los efectos de la orden de 2 de 
Octubre, 1940, si tuviere buenos fundamentos para ello; pero no solo no lo ha 
pedido formal y seriamente, de acuerdo con la regla y practica procesal 
pertinente, sino que, aunque lo hiciera, dudamos mucho que pueda prosperar el 
pedimento, constando, como consta, que la herencia yacente no solo no ha sufrido 
una dislocacion irremediable, sino que cuenta con fondos montantes a 351 mil 
pesos—muchisimo mas que suficientes para sufragar los adelantos en cuestion, sin 
detrimento del usufructo de la recurrida.</p>
<p>Ademas, si el Estado ya ha recibido y esta recibiendo sustanciales anticipos 
de la mitad que le corresponde en la herencia ¿por que las peticionarias, que 
son hermanas del testador, no han de tener, por lo menos, el mismo 
derecho?</p>Voto, por tanto, en favor de la concesion del recurso.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>PABLO, M.:</strong></p>
<p>Disiento. En mi humilde opinion no procede el recurso de <em>mandamus</em> en 
el caso presente. La apelacion es el remedio adecuado para revisar la orden del 
Hon. Juez Barrios de 27 de Febrero de 1947 que desestimo la mocion de las 
recurrentes de 18 de Febrero del mismo año. La mocion de reconsideracion esta 
bien denegada.</p>
<p>La orden de 2 de Octubre de 1940 que concede pension a las recurrentes 
(monthly allowance) no es irrevocable, que con el simple transcurso del tiempo 
ya es deber ministerial del Juzgado el cumplir o mandar cumplir por medio del 
Sheriff sus disposiciones. La naturaleza de la obligacion de dar pension esta 
sujeta en algunos casos a las fluctuaciones de la capacidad economica del 
obligado; en otros, en la necesidad del pensionista. Uno que presta pension de 
P200 mensuales, por ejemplo, que esta recibiendo en sus negocios un ingreso 
liquido de P2,000 no esta obligado a continuar concediendo la misma cantidad si, 
por las vicisitudes de una guerra, no obtiene ganancias sino que queda 
arruinado. Un niño recien nacido no ha de recibir una pension igual a la que 
recibiria si estuviese estudiando medicina. Aunque existiera una sentencia final 
sobre la prestacion de una pension, su cuantia no es irrevocable, ni firme: esta 
sujeta a varias circunstancias de cada caso particular y es el Juzgado el que 
tiene la facultad de determinar su aumento o diminucion, su pago completo o 
suspension, despues de oir a las partes interesadas. "Se concede considerable 
amplitud al juzgado de primera instancia para modificar o revocar sus propias 
ordenes, en tanto en cuanto esten pendientes las actuaciones en el mismo juzgado 
y se presenten en tiempo oportuno solicitudes o mociones para tales 
modificaciones por las partes interesadas." (Oñas <em>contra</em> Javillo y 
otros, 54 Jur. Fil., 643.)</p>
<p>Es absurda la teoria de que la orden de 2 de Octubre de 1940 dictada en la 
Testamentaria de E. M. Bachrach es ejecutoria y es deber ministerial del Juzgado 
el hacer cumplir sus disposiciones. El articulo 1.° de la Regla 39 no es 
aplicable al caso presente; no es aplicable a las actuaciones sobre la 
administracion y distribucion de los bienes de difuntos; es solamente aplicable 
a los asuntos ordinarios.</p>
<p>Y si es final esa orden de 2 de Octubre de 1940, como si fuera una sentencia 
dictada en un asunto ordinario, entonces seria mas improcedente aun el 
<em>mandamus</em>. Desde la fecha de su promulgacion hasta el 27 de Febrero de 
1947 en que se dicto la orden, cuya revocacion piden las recurrentes, han 
transcurrido ya seis años, cuatro meses y veinticinco dias. Despues del 
transcurso de cinco años ya no se puede pedir por medio de una simple mocion la 
ejecucucion de una sentencia. (Articulo 6, Regla 39.)</p>
<p>Si es erronea o no la orden de 27 de Febrero de 1947, el error debe 
corregirse en una apelacion y no en un recurso especial de <em>mandamus</em>. 
Solamente se puede hacer uso de tal remedio cuando no existe en el curso 
ordinario de los procedimientos un medio facil, adecuado y expedito como la 
apelacion. (Herrera <em>contra</em> Barretto, 25 Jur. Fil., 253; Gala

<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I am constrained to dissent from the foregoing opinion of the majority. In my 
view of the case, its final analysis boils down to the pivotal question of 
whether the petition dated September 16, 1940, filed by the instant petitioners 
(Sophie M. Seifert and Elisa Elianoff) and Ginda M. Skundina and Annie Bachrach, 
bearing the conformity of the instant respondent Mary McDonald Bachrach as 
"administratrix and usufructuary", as well as that of the Solicitor General, and 
transcribed on pages 3-5 of the majority decision, became so binding upon the 
probate court after it granted said petition by its order of October 2, 1940, 
inserted on pages 1-3 of the same decision, that it became the ministerial duty 
of said court to subject the estate under administration absolutely and 
unqualifiedly to the payment of each and every monthly allowance specified in 
the said petition, regardless of the vicissitudes which the estate might go 
through before its final settlement and distribution after payment of "the 
debts, funeral charges, and expenses of administration, the allowances to the 
widow, and inheritance tax", or any of these concepts, as provided in Rule 91, 
section 1. The majority opinion enumerates these so-called allowances, quoting 
from the lower court's order of October 2, 1940, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left" width="34%">Sophie M. Seifert</td>
<td width="66%">P500.00 monthly;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Ginda M. Skundina</td>
<td>  250.00 monthly;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Elisa Elianoff</td>
<td>  250.00 monthly;</td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Annie Bachrach Levine</td>
<td>  250.00 monthly</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>beginning July 1, 1940, through the war years, to the present, plus an 
additional P3,000 to Sophie M. Seifert "who is in poor health".</p>
<p>Paragraph VI of the petition alleges that of the above amounts the 
administratrix, who is the same widow of the deceased, did not pay petitioners 
the monthly allowances from January 1, 1942, to July 31, 1945, or a total of 
P21,500 for petitioner Sophie M. Seifert, and P10,750 for petitioner Elisa 
Elianoff. Roughly, this would comprise the war years when the business of the 
aforesaid estate was laid prostrate and its properties suffered heavy losses, 
which facts and circumstances must have been taken into consideration by the 
respondent judge Hon. Conrado Barrios, when by his order of February 27, 1947, 
he denied petitioners' petition filed on February 19, 1947, excepting that part 
relating to the "allowances" of petitioners Sophie M. Seifert and Elisa Elianoff 
for the months of February and March, 1947, which said judge ordered to be paid 
"out of the available funds of the estate." These so-called allowances cannot 
be, in my opinion, other than advancements on account of petitioners' hereditary 
portions. They are not real allowances in the sense of something which they have 
a <em>right</em> to receive from the estate pending actual delivery of their 
hereditary portions. There is no law that would give them that right, in view of 
the fact that they are not the widow nor the minor or incapacitated children, or 
members of the family, of the deceased.</p>
<p>Under section 684 of the Code of Civil Procedure, those entitled to such 
allowances were the widow and minor children of the deceased. In section 753 of 
the same Code these are referred to as "the family of the deceased." And under 
Rule 84, section 3, of the present Rules of Court those entitled to such 
allowances are "the widow and minor or incapacitated children" of the deceased. 
But even their right to receive the allowance is there provided to be made 
"under the direction of the court," which implies the continuing power of the 
probate court to control at least the amount of the allowances, according to the 
varied and unpredictable circumstances under which the estate may pass from time 
to time during the judicial administration thereof. The last cited provision 
ends, in referring to the allowances, with the important clause: "such 
allowances as are provided by law." And article 147 of the Civil Code ordains 
that the amount allowed for support, in the cases referred to in article 146, 
shall be reduced or increased proportionately according to the increase or 
reduction of the necessities of the recipient and the <em>means</em> of the 
person obliged to give it. Even if petitioners had been included in the cases 
referred to in article 146 (which are those mentioned in article 143) of the 
Code—which would have given them a <em>legal</em> right to support—it would seem 
clear, even in that hypothesis, that the probate court, in granting the 
aforesaid petition of September 16, 1940, should not be deemed to have given up 
its legal authority and duty to exercise a continuing control over the amount of 
the allowance, as contemplated in said article 147 and as held in Gorayeb 
<em>vs</em>. Hashim, 47 Phil., 87, 88, hereinafter more particularly discussed. 
Neither could said court have validly renounced such a vital part of its 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The pertinent legal provisions to which reference is thus made are found in 
articles 143, 146, and 147 of the Civil Code. Article 147 expressly provides 
that the amount allowed for support (allowance) in the cases to which article 
146 refers shall be reduced or increased proportionately according to the 
increase or reduction of the necessities of the recipient and the <em>means</em> 
of the person obliged to give it. And it was upon such provision that this Court 
held in Gorayeb <em>vs</em>. Hashim, <em>supra</em>, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With reference to the amount of the maintenance allowance awarded by the 
court below, it may be observed that inasmuch as in respect to modifications, a 
judgment rendered in a suit for separate maintenance is not regarded as final 
and may be modified at any time for sufficient reasons upon application to the 
court having original jurisdiction, the appellate courts will, as a rule, not 
interfere with the findings and conclusions of the lower courts in regard to 
such allowances. Upon the evidence before us, we cannot say that in this case 
the allowance is so excessive as to call for our interference."</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, while the case just cited was concerned with the allowance of a 
wife, the governing legal the same in other cases of support comprised within 
the same codal articles providing for a wife's support.</p>
<p>If even in cases of allowance or support provided for by law the competent 
court retains a continuing power in the proceedings or the case involving the 
same, to control and direct the giving thereof as regards its amount, and if "in 
respect to modifications, a judgment rendered in a suit for separate maintenance 
(the rule should be the same in an estate proceeding because the reason therefor 
is the same in both cases) is not regarded as final and may be modified at any 
time for sufficient reasons upon application to the court having original 
jurisdiction", why should the probate court in the instant case be denied that 
power or control when the allowances claimed <em>are not even provided for by 
law, nor by will, nor by contract?</em></p>
<p>Title VI of Book I of the Civil Code does not contain any provision for such 
an allowance to parties situated as are petitioners herein. The will of the 
deceased E. M. Bachrach does not contain any provision therefor.</p>
<p>The majority opinion, however, holds that "the conformity or agreement of all 
the parties to the petition of September 16, 1940, gives it the nature of a 
contract." I cannot subscribe to this holding. The conformity of respondent to 
that petition was given in her double capacity of "administratrix and 
usufructuary." As administratrix, she was a mere agent of the probate court and 
was not acting in her personal capacity. And while as usufructuary she was 
acting in such personal capacity, in the very nature of things, the fundamental 
inquiry which now demands our consideration is whether the probate court's 
granting of the aforesaid petition made it so binding upon said court that it 
has no other alternative but to order or authorize specific payment of 
<em>all</em> the monthly allowances mentioned in the petition—that the court by 
granting said petition lost all control over the matter and became thenceforward 
completely powerless to order a reduction of the so-called allowances even 
though facts and circumstances subsequently supervening advised such reduction 
in the court's judgment and discretion. Such a proposition amounts to 
nothingless than to assert that the probate court was by the will of the parties 
divested of a very substantial part of its jurisdiction and control over the 
estate. It is said that "the conformity or agreement of all the parties to the 
petition of September 16, 1940, gives it the nature of a contract." If we were 
to consider such an alleged contract to have been entered into by respondent, as 
judicial administratrix, it could not be her personal contract—if at all, it 
would be the contract of the probate court, of which she was a mere agent as 
such administratrix, and which granted the petition; but this is entirely 
unthinkable. A probate court, or any other court of justice for that matter, 
cannot, and never does, enter into any contract or agreement regarding its 
jurisdiction, much less to barter it away wholly or partially. And even if it 
should be said that respondent Mary McDonald Bachrach entered into that 
agreement or contract also as a usufructuary—altho I do not admit even this—it 
is obvious that her will, as thus expressed therein, was and is subordinated to 
the superior will of the probate court. In other words, the fact that she, as 
usufructuary, may agree that she be authorized by the court to pay the so-called 
allowances, if the probate court, which is the guardian and keeper of the estate 
of the deceased, should at any time consider such burden as too onerous upon the 
estate for the reasons already stated above or any other that the court might 
have had, it is the will of said court that must prevail and not that of the 
usufructuary. Such a contingency concretely happened with respect to the 
"allowances" corresponding to the war years, which the court evidently 
considered unjustifiable due to the "reduction * * * of the means" of the estate 
by reason of the war; and the court in effect ordered a reduction of the 
"allowances" in general by refusing to order payment of those corresponding to 
said years.</p>
<p>Under clause eight of the will of the deceased (pp. 8-9, majority opinion) 
the testator's legal heirs will have no right to receive the half of his estate, 
personal, real and otherwise, bequeathed to them, until his widow's death—"upon 
the death of my beloved wife," is the testator's textual phrase. During the 
judicial administration of the estate the probate court had the duty to give 
preferential consideration to the payment of the deceased's debts and 
obligations, aside from the administration expenses. The probate court must have 
considered that during that period the estate might suffer losses which would 
diminish its assets, as it actually did during the late war when the business 
and properties of the estate suffered heavy losses and were subjected to a 
terrible financial frustration. Consequently, in the exercise of its control 
over the disbursements to be made, among other things, by way of the so-called 
allowances to the present petitioners, that court had to consider all these 
matters and even eventualities, and to act accordingly, not permitting the widow 
and the legal heirs to deviate it from the course most in consonance with the 
will of the testator and the law, in the court's best judgment and discretion. 
And I am persuaded that this is exactly what Judge Barrios did when he denied 
authority for the payment of the so-called allowances corresponding to the war 
years. If we held the probate court, and after the closing of the estate 
proceeding, the widow, absolutely bound to the payment of each and all of the 
so-called monthly allowances to petitioners, regardless of losses in the 
meantime suffered by the estate, until the widow's death it may happen that upon 
the arrival of the time predetermined by the testator—the demise of his 
widow—for his legal heirs to receive their portion in the estate, petitioners 
will have received, by way of "allowances", more than the portion intended by 
the testator, to the damage and prejudice of other legal heirs who have not 
given their conformity to what the majority opinion calls an "agreement" or a 
"contract" between petitioners and the widow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a sounder construction of the petition of September 16, 1940, 
would be that whatever may have been agreed upon by the parties therein was 
<em>without prejudice</em> to the continuing control and power of the probate 
court over the subject-matter thereof under the applicable provisions of the law 
and rules.</p>
<p>Even though petitioners are among the "legal heirs" mentioned by the testator 
in the 8th clause of his will, under said clause they will not be entitled to 
take delivery of and receive their shares in the estate until the demise of the 
decedent's widow. So that the so-called allowances, or more accurately, 
advancements spoken of in the court's order of October 2, 1940, were not granted 
<em>as a matter of right</em>.</p>
<p>Consequently, I am of the considered opinion that the respondent judge acted 
entirely within the powers of the probate court that he was presiding in 
refusing to issue a writ of execution or otherwise to order payments, as prayed 
for by petitioners, and in entering its order of February 27, 1947. And, as in 
Gorayeb <em>vs</em>. Hashim, supra, I believe we should here apply the same rule 
that "the appellate courts will, as a rule, not interfere with the findings and 
conclusions of the lower courts in regard to such allowances". It is submitted 
that the instant petition should be denied.</p>
