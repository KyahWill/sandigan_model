				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Solicitor General moves to dismiss the appeal interposed by&nbsp; the City Fiscal of&nbsp; Manila from the&nbsp; order of the Court of First Instance dismissing the three above-numbered cases on the ground that the offense complained of had prescribed.<br><br>The offense in question is unjust vexation alleged to have been&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant Victor Tayco against Marcelina Alcacetas, Flora Carreon and Rosalina Valenzuela on May 5, May 6, and May 2 and May 6, 1941, respectively.&nbsp; The offended parties complained to the City Fiscal on May 24, 1941,&nbsp; but the City Fiscal's office did not file the corresponding information&nbsp; in the Municipal Court until&nbsp; July 10, 1941, that is to say, more than&nbsp; two months after the commission and discovery of the offense.&nbsp; The Municipal Court denied defendant's motion to quash, but upon appeal the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance (Judge Jose R. Carlos presiding) dismissed the three cases, and the City Fiscal appealed to this Court.<br><br>Unjust vexation is classified&nbsp; as a light offense,&nbsp; it being punished under the second paragraph of article 287 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code with <i>arresto menor</i> or a fine ranging from P5&nbsp; to P200, or both.&nbsp; Under article&nbsp; 90 of the same Code, light offenses prescribe in two months; and article 91 provides that "the period of prescription shall commence to run from the day on which the crime is discovered by&nbsp; the offended party, the authorities or their agents, and shall be interrupted by the filing of&nbsp; the complaint&nbsp; or&nbsp; information, and shall commence to&nbsp; run&nbsp; again&nbsp; when such proceedings terminate without the accused being convicted or acquitted, or are unjustifiably stopped for any reason not imputable to him."<br><br>We gather from the order of dismissal appealed from that the contention of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; is that the&nbsp; running&nbsp; of the prescriptive&nbsp; period&nbsp; was&nbsp; interrupted&nbsp; from the time the offended parties&nbsp; reported the offense to his office on May 24, 1941.&nbsp; We agree with the lower court and the Solicitor General&nbsp; that&nbsp; such contention is untenable. Section 2465 of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code, upon which the City Fiscal&nbsp; relies, requires&nbsp; him to&nbsp; investigate "all charges of crimes, misdemeanors,&nbsp; and violations&nbsp; of ordinances, and have the necessary informations or complaints&nbsp; prepared&nbsp; or made against&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons accused." From this it is claimed by the City Fiscal that he has the power to conduct a preliminary investigation like a justice of the peace, and that the lodging of a complaint in his office by the offended party is like the filing of a complaint in a justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace court.&nbsp; But&nbsp; under&nbsp; article&nbsp; 91&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code, the running of the period of prescription is interrupted not&nbsp; by the act of the&nbsp; offended party in reporting the offense to the fiscal but by the filing of the complaint or information.&nbsp; Said article further provides that the period of prescription shall commence to run again when the proceedings initiated by&nbsp; the filing of the&nbsp; complaint or information terminate without the accused being convicted or acquitted.&nbsp; Thus, it is clear that the complaint or information&nbsp; referred to in article 91 is that which is filed in the proper court and not the <i>denuncia</i> or&nbsp; accusation lodged by the offended party in the City Fiscal's office.&nbsp; It is needless to add that such accusation in&nbsp; the City Fiscal's office cannot end there&nbsp; in the acquittal or conviction of the accused.<br><br>We consider the Solicitor General's motion to dismiss the appeal as a brief on the merit; and since the result is favorable to the defendant-appellee, we deem&nbsp; it unnecessary to hear the latter.<br><br>The order of dismissal entered by the court below is affirmed and the appeal herein is dismissed for lack of merit, with costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abad Santos, Diaz, Moran</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Horrilleno, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
