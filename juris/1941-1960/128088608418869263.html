				G.R. No. L-5856, December 29, 1953</h4>
				<H3>MARCELINO A. BUSACAY, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ANTONIO F. BUENAVENTURA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PROVINCIAL TREASURER OF PANGASINAN, OR HIS SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE, AND ALFREDO MURAO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In his motion for reconsideration appellant asks that the court 
positively declare that he is entitled to the payment of back salaries 
in order that he "may take the necessary administrative remedy" for 
their collection.
  <p>    It is a universal principle that judgments must be responsive 
to the issues presented by the pleadings.  (49 C. J. S., 117.)  As there
 can be no issues between plaintiff or defendant and a stranger to the 
case, no judgment can be rendered for or against one who has not been 
impleaded.  (41 C. J. S., 117.)  In fact, not only is there no issue 
between plaintiff or defendant and a person not a party to an action, 
but the court has absolutely no jurisdiction of his person.</p>
  <p>    The objection would not disappear if the declaration here 
sought were to be used merely to persuade the proper authorities to pay 
the appellant his claim.  It is also and unvarying rule of courts to 
refrain from making any adjudication the enforcement of which would be 
left to the discretion or will of the debtor, or any pronouncement which
 would affect the rights of parties who have not had their day in court.
  Any declaration holding any officials of the Government liable for the
 payment of appellant's salary for the time he was kept out of the 
position of toll collector would be unfair as prejudging any suit that 
might be brought against them in case they refuse.</p>
  <p>    The prayer that, in the alternative, "The defendant Provincial 
Treasurer be condemned to pay from his own private funds as exemplary 
damages to the plaintiff" the appellant's salary "during the period of 
the latter's legal suspension or dismissal" was amply discussed in our 
decision.  We find no reason for altering our conclusion that the 
Provincial Treasurer cannot be held liable.  There is no proof that he 
acted in bad faith, as charged.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the motion for reconsideration is denied.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista
 Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
