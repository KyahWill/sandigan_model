				<H3>LEE GUAN, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>An appeal by Lee  Guan from a  decision of the Court of First  Instance of  Bulacan  denying  his  petition for naturalization  as a citizen of  the  Philippines, upon two (2) grounds, namely,  (a)  inadequacy of the evidence on petitioner's moral character,  and  (b)  insufficiency of the knowledge of English or Spanish, to enable him to speak and write either language.</p>
<p>Referring to the second ground, the lower court found "that petitioner could not speak and write  English or Spanish.  His  knowledge  of  English is indeed scanty for he does not even know enough words for purpose of daily life so that 'he can understand those with whom he speaks and they can  understand him'  in  turn.   The Court has tried to test his proficiency in English and found that he could not speak and write English except a few  words or sentences which had been dictated to him by his counsel." Indeed,  the transcript of  the hearing in the lower court shows  that the following took  place in the course  of petitioner's testimony:</p>
<blockquote><table border="0" width="100%">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top">"Atty. Ramos:</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q.—</td>
    <td width="90%">Are you in favor  of using  force in order to  get what you want?  Answer in Tagalog without the benefit of translating same  to you  in Tagalog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">"A.—</td>
    <td>I do not understand the question.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">"Q.—</td>
    <td>I will put that in  another  form.  Do you believe in  using force so that you  may get  what you want?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">"Court:</td>
    <td>(To Interpreter)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Do not translate anymore the question just propounded by Atty. Ramos  and let witness answer same  in Tagalog without first waiting for the translation thereof.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">"A.—</td>
    <td>I cannot answer the question.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top">"Atty. Ramos:</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">"Q.—</td>
    <td>Did you understand the question  or do you not understand the question?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">"A.—</td>
    <td>I am not able  to answer the question."  (p. 6, t.s.n., Sess. of Dec 21, 1957).</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table></blockquote>
<p>Again the Court bade him to write in English: "Dear Mayor,  we were  robbed last night."  Instead,  petitioner wrote: "thre mayro will las ne nesutg nelug."  Asked to write in Tagalog:   "Magkano ang halaga nang inyong bigas ngayon?"  "Mayor,  baka po maaring  pabantayan ninyo ng pulis ang aming  bahay upang hindi  kami manakawan."  What he wrote was "Belame any buga inyo ng Bakano ang halaga ng inyo Bigas gayon.  Mayor magkapo maari mag bantayan ng pulis hu  ang amen bahay ng kameng nakawan." </p>
<p>Thus, the  record not only bears out the above-quoted finding  of His Honor, the trial Judge, but, also, indicates that petitioner's  ability to write in Tagalog,  the  only local dialect he  claims to  command,  is  rather deficient.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as petitioner lacks one of the requisite qualifications for naturalization—ability to  speak and . write English or Spanish  (Section  2,  fifth subdivision,  Commonwealth Act No. 473)—a discussion of the first ground for the  denial of  his petition is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision  appealed from is  hereby affirmed,  with costs  against  the petitioner-appellant.  It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.  B. L.,  Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
