				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Plaintiffs filed in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Pangasinan an&nbsp; action seeking to annul the judgment&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; in a registration case&nbsp; (G.L.R.O. Record No. 54794)&nbsp; which&nbsp; was jointly heard with another case&nbsp; concerning recovery of two&nbsp; of the lots that were the subject of registration (Civil Case No. 8853), on the ground that said judgment was obtained through fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant filed a motion&nbsp; to dismiss which, as amended, disputed the&nbsp; sufficiency of the complaint on three&nbsp; grounds;&nbsp; (<em>a</em>) that the court had&nbsp; no jurisdiction of the person&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendant;&nbsp; (<em>b</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp; that the cause of action was barred by a prior judgment;&nbsp; and (<em>c</em>)&nbsp; that the complaint states no cause of&nbsp; action. </p><p>After plaintiffs had filed their&nbsp; objection to said motion and&nbsp; defendant had replied, the&nbsp; court&nbsp; found the motion to dismiss well taken on the ground that the alleged fraud&nbsp; on which the cause of action of plaintiffs is predicated, even if committed, is not extrinsic or&nbsp; collateral to the issues involved in&nbsp; the&nbsp; former&nbsp; case, but&nbsp; intrinsic or one which&nbsp; should have been raised therein because it was part and parcel of the defense&nbsp; that the plaintiffs had set up to protect&nbsp; their&nbsp; interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court dismissed the&nbsp; case without costs.</p><p>The&nbsp; case&nbsp; was originally taken to the Court of&nbsp; Appeals but it&nbsp; was later certified to this&nbsp; Court under section 17, subsection 6 of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 296, because it merely involves questions of law.</p><p>The&nbsp; facts which, according&nbsp; to the complaint,&nbsp; constitute the alleged&nbsp; fraud on which plaintiffs base their cause&nbsp; of action&nbsp; to annul the judgment&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; in&nbsp; the former case, are: (1)&nbsp; the concealment by&nbsp; defendant of the true traces&nbsp; of&nbsp; an old sugar mill and of the house of&nbsp; their predecessors-in-mterest by&nbsp; indicating some&nbsp; big stones&nbsp; with in the&nbsp; perimeter of lot No. 8 is the ocular inspection conducted by the court, because the truth is that said traces are on the western side of lot 8,&nbsp; located in another property belonging to defendant;&nbsp; (2) the&nbsp; refusal of the trial judge&nbsp; to&nbsp; conduct an ocular inspection of the other side of Cabatuan creek to&nbsp; see&nbsp; for&nbsp; himself&nbsp; the location of the true traces of said sugar mill&nbsp; and house without any justifiable reason;&nbsp; and (3) the mysterious&nbsp; disappearance&nbsp; of the record of the proceedings concerning the&nbsp; ocular inspection made by the trial&nbsp; judge as above adverted&nbsp; to.</p><p>But&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears&nbsp; on the very face of the complaint that those facts,&nbsp; which allegedly&nbsp; constitute the fraud on which the action of plaintiffs&nbsp; is&nbsp; predicated,&nbsp; are matters which have transpired in the course of the ocular inspection made by the trial judge in the former case and which said trial judge&nbsp; had already considered and passed upon in his decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; even appears&nbsp; that when the ocular&nbsp; inspection was made, both parties were&nbsp; present&nbsp; with their counsel, and&nbsp; the objection of&nbsp; plaintiffs to&nbsp; the indication of the traces or remains&nbsp; of the old sugar mill and&nbsp; house determinative of&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; possession has been, duly&nbsp; noted by the trial judge only that the same was not given due consideration by him.&nbsp; And it likewise appears that these matters have also&nbsp; been taken up by plaintiffs&nbsp; in connection with their appeal to the Court of Appeals&nbsp; but that said court did&nbsp; not decide them in their favor but instead affirmed the&nbsp; findings of&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is therefore evident that the&nbsp; alleged fraud now&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; by plaintiffs predicated on those facts is not extrinsic&nbsp; or collateral but intrinsic in the sense that they have not only been raised but were the subject of adjudication&nbsp; by both the former court and the Court of Appeals and as such&nbsp; it cannot be considered&nbsp; as sufficient basis for annulling the judgment rendered in the&nbsp; former&nbsp; case.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"There can be no&nbsp; question as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; right of any person&nbsp; adversely affected by a judgment, to maintain an&nbsp; action to&nbsp; enjoin its enforcement, and&nbsp; to have it declared a nullity, on the ground of fraud and collusion practiced in the&nbsp; very matter of obtaining the judgment,&nbsp; when&nbsp; such fraud is extrinsic or collateral&nbsp; to&nbsp; the matters involved in the issues raised at the trial which resulted in such judgment; and&nbsp; fraudulent&nbsp; collusion&nbsp; between&nbsp; an administrator and a third person resulting in an order or judgment where by an&nbsp; interested person is unjustly&nbsp; deprived of his rights&nbsp; in, or to the&nbsp; estate under administration, has&nbsp; always&nbsp; been recognized as a&nbsp; sufficient ground&nbsp; for the grant of relief from the&nbsp; order or judgment thus fraudulently procured."&nbsp; (Anuran <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Aquino and&nbsp; Ortiz, 38&nbsp; Phil., 29)&nbsp; </p><p>"Fraud to be ground for nullity of a judgment must&nbsp; be extrinsic to the litigations.&nbsp; Were&nbsp; not this the rule there would&nbsp; be no end to&nbsp; litigation, perjury being of&nbsp; such&nbsp; common&nbsp; occurrence in trials.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; under the&nbsp; opposite rule, the losing&nbsp; party&nbsp; could attack&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; at&nbsp; any&nbsp; time by attributing&nbsp; imaginary&nbsp; false hood to his adversary's proofs.&nbsp; But the settled law is&nbsp; that judicial determination&nbsp; however&nbsp; erroneous&nbsp; of matters brought&nbsp; within the court's jurisdiction cannot&nbsp; be invalidated in another proceeding. It is the business of a party to meet and repel his opponent's perjured&nbsp; evidence."&nbsp; (Almeda <em>vs.</em> Cruz,&nbsp; 47&nbsp; Off. Gaz., No. 3, 1179, 1180.)</p></blockquote><p>It is true, as plaintiffs claim, that when the former case was appealed&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; they&nbsp; discovered that the record of the proceedings&nbsp; concerning the ocular inspection made by the trial court has "mysteriously" disappeared and for that reason the Court&nbsp; of Appeals could not&nbsp; act&nbsp; properly&nbsp; on the&nbsp; issues&nbsp; raised&nbsp; concerning said ocular inspection, but why did not plaintiffs take the necessary steps&nbsp; in&nbsp; order&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; record of&nbsp; said&nbsp; ocular inspection may be located or&nbsp; reconstituted as&nbsp; required&nbsp; by law?&nbsp; It is preposterous to contend that such disappearance is the&nbsp; result of a conspiracy between the trial judge and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant.&nbsp; In any event, it was the concern of plaintiffs to have the matters&nbsp; investigated in due time, and&nbsp; this they&nbsp; failed to do.&nbsp; But&nbsp; this circumstance alone cannot certainly be the basis of annulment of a judgment duly rendered and affirmed&nbsp; by the. appellate court and which&nbsp; has become final long&nbsp; ago.</p><p>Wherefore, the&nbsp; order&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.</em>, and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
