				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On  April 20, 1952, Rufino  D. Andres filed a  complaint in the Court of  First Instance  of Ilocos  Norte against the  Crown  Life Insurance  Company for the recovery of the amount of P5,000, as the  face  value of a joint 20-year 920  endowment insurance policy issued in favor of the plaintiff Rufino  D. Andres and his wife  Severa G.  Andres  on the 13th  of February,  1950, by said insurance company.   On June  7, 1951,  Rufino Andres presented his  death claim as survivor-beneficiary  of the  deceased  Severa G.  Andres, who  died  May 3,  1951.  Payment having been denied by the insurance company on  April 20, 1952,  this  case  was instituted. <br><br>Defendant Company filed its  answer in  due time  disclaiming liability and  setting  forth  the  special defense that the aforementioned policy had already  lapsed.   Later, on  March  25, 1954,  the parties submitted  the case  for decision by the lower court  upon  a stipulation of facts, fully  quoted hereunder:<br><ol><li>"That on October 20,  1949, plaintiff and Severa  G.  Andres filed  an  application  for insurance No. 536,423, which  are hereto marked  as common Exhibits "1" and "1-A", respectively;<br><br> </li><li>That on  February  13, 1950,  defendant  issued Crown  Life Policy No. 536,423 for the  sum of P5,000,  in the name of Rufino D. Andres, plaintiff, and Severa G. Andres, which is hereto marked as common Exhibit "2";<br><br> </li><li>That the premiums are to be paid as called for in the policy Exhibit  "2", semi-annually, and the amount of P165.15 for  the first semester beginning November  25, 1949 to May 25, 1950 was paid on November 25, 1949, which is hereby marked as common  Exhibit "3",  and  the  premium  likewise  in  the  sum of  P165.15  for the second semester beginning May 25, 1950 to November 25, 1950, was paid  on June 24, 1950, as evidenced by  common  Exhibit "3-A"; and the premium for the third semester  beginning November  25, 1950  to  May 25, 1951  was not paid;<br><br> </li><li>That on January 6,  1951, the defendant, thru Mr. I.  B. Melendres, wrote to Mr.  and  Mrs.  Rufino D.  Andres advising  them that  the said Policy No.  536,423  lapsed  on December 25, 1950 and the amount overdue  was P165.15, giving  them a  period  of  sixty (60)  days  from the date of lapse to file an application for reinstatement, which letter is made as common Exhibit "4";<br><br> </li><li>That on February 12, 1951, the said Mr. I. B. Melendres, branch secretary of the defendant,  wrote Mr. and  Mrs. Rufino  D.  Andres, telling the latter that  Policy  No. 536,423 was no  longer  in  force and it lapsed on December 25, 1950,  which letter is herewith  made as common Exhibit "5";<br><br> </li><li>That in  the  month  of  February, 1951,  plaintiff  executed a Statement of Health which is at the same time  an Application  for Reinstatement  of  the  aforesaid policy, which application  is  herewith made as common  Exhibit "6" (Note: Exhibit "6" is the reverse side  of Exhibit "4").  and  Severa  G. Andres  also executed in  the month of February, 1951,  an Application  for  Reinstatement, which Application  for Reinstatement  is  made  as common Exhibit "7";<br><br> </li><li>That on February 20, 1951, plaintiff  wrote  a letter to the  defendant  and enclosed  therewith a money order  for P100,  which letter was received by  the  defendant  on February 26, 1951, wherein it  is  stated that the  balance unpaid is the sum  of P65.15, which letter is  hereby made  as common  Exhibit "8";<br><br> </li><li>That on April 14, 1951, the said  Mr. I. B.  Melendres, as branch secretary for the  defendant;  wrote plaintiff advising him  that  the Home  Office has approved  the  reinstatement  of  the lapsed policy, subject to the payment of  P65.15 due on November,  1950 premium, a  duplicate original copy   of  the  said letter is  hereby made as common  Exhibit "9";<br><br> </li><li>That on April 27, 1951,  said  Mr.  I.

B. Melendres  wrote a letter  to  Mr.  and Mrs.  Rufino D.  Andres,   enclosing an  Official Receipt for the receipt of  P165.15, which  Official Receipt is hereby made  as common  Exhibit "12",  and  also  enclosed  therewith a Certificate of Reinstatement dated  April 2, 1951, which is herewith made as common  Exhibit  "13", and  the duplicate original copy of the aforesaid letter dated May 15, 1951 is herewith made as common Exhibit "14", and  premium notice addressed to Mr. and  Mrs. Rufino D. Andres,  wherein it is  shown that the semi-annual  premium in the sum  of P165.15 on  the said policy would be due on May 15, 1951, which premium notice  is herewith made as common Exhibit "14-A";<br><br> </li><li>That  on  June 7, 1951,  plaintiff presented his Death Claim as survivor-beneficiary of the deceased  Severa  G.

Melendres wrote to plaintiff stating defendant's reasons for its refusal to pay the  death claim of the plaintiff which letter is herewith made as common Exhibit "16",  in which there was therein enclosed a Death Claim Discharge to be  signed by the plaintiff but the plaintiff refused to  sign, which Death Claim Discharge is  herewith made as common Exhibit "16-A";<br><br> </li><li>That on November 23, 1951, the  said Mr. I. B. Melendres wrote plaintiff  enclosing therewith a National City  Bank of New York Check No. D-115356  for P165.00  payable to  plaintiff,  dated  June 21, 1951, an  original duplicate copy of  which is herewith made as common Exhibit "17";<br><br> </li><li>That on  December 1,  1951, the  plaintiff wrote defendant company and enclosed therewith the  aforesaid  National City Bank of New York Check No. D-115356  dated June 21, 1951, which letter is herewith made  as Common  Exhibit "18", and the check returned to the defendant  company as  Exhibit "18-A";<br><br> </li><li>That with the approval of this stipulation of facts, the parties hereby submit the same and do hereby request  the Honorable Court to give them twenty  (20) days within which to file simultaneously their  corresponding memoranda and another fifteen  (15)  days for a reply memorandum." (Rec. App., pp. 17-22) </li></ol>On  August  5,  1954,  Judge  Julio Villamor  rendered decision absolving the defendant from any liability on  the ground that  the policy having  lapsed,  it was  not reinstated at the time  the plaintiff's wife died.  Not satisfied with the  decision,  plaintiff appealed to the Court of  Appeals, but the appeal was later certified to this Court,  for there is no question of fact involved therein. <br><br>As has  been  correctly  stated by  the  lower court,  the resolution  of the issues in this case centers  on whether or not policy No. 536423  (Exhibit  "2")  which has been in a  state of lapse before May  3,  1951, has  been  validly and completely reinstated after said date.   In  other words, was  there a perfected contract  of reinstatement after the policy lapsed due to non-payment of premiums? <br><br>The  stipulation  of facts and  accompanying  exhibits render it undisputable that the  original policy No. 536423 lapsed  for non-payment  of premiums on December 26, 1950, upon expiration of the customary 31-day  period of grace.  The subsequent reinstatement  of  the policy was provided for in the contract itself in the following terms: <br><blockquote>"If this policy lapses, it may be reinstated upon application made within three years from the date of lapse, and upon production of evidence of the good health of the injured (and also of the  Beneficiary, if the rate of  premium depends upon the age of the  Beneficiary), and such  other evidence  of  insurability at the date of application  for reinstatment  as would then  satisfy  the  Company to issue a new Policy on the same terms as  this Policy, and upon payment of all overdue premiums and  other indebtedness in respect of this Policy, together with interest  at six  per cent, compounded annually, and provided also that no change has taken place in such good health  and  insurability subsequent to  the  date of  such application and before this Policy is reinstated." </blockquote>As stated by the lower  court, the conditions set  forth in the  policy  for reinstatement are the  following:  (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) application shall be made within three years from the date of lapse; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) there  should be a production of evidence of the good health of the insured:  (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) if the rate of premium depends upon the age of the Beneficiary, there should likewise be a production of evidence of his or her good health; (<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>)  there should  be presented  such  other   evidence of insurability at  the  date of application  for reinstatement; (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)  there should be no change which  has taken  place in such good  health and insurability subsequent to the date of such  application  and before  the policy is reinstated; and (f)  all overdue premiums and  other  indebtedness in respect of the policy, together with interest at six per cent, compounded annually, should first be paid. <br><br>The  plaintiff-appellant  did  not  comply with the  last condition; for he only paid P100 (on account of the  overdue  semi-annual premium of P165.15) on  1951, before his wife's death (Stipulation, par.  7);  and, despite the  Company's reminders on April 14 and 27,  he remitted the balance of P65 on May 5, 1951 (received  by the Company's  agency on  May 11), two  days after his wife died.  On  the  face of such  facts,  the Company had the right to treat the contract as lapsed and refuse  payment of the policy. <br><br>Appellant, however,  contends that the condition regarding payment of  the premium  was waived by the insurance Company by its  letters (signed by I. B. Melendres, cashier) Exhibits  4  and  5,  wherein the  Company manifested  to appellant: <br><blockquote>"If you can not pay the full amount immediately, send as  large an amount as possible and  advise us  how soon  you expect to be able to pay the balance. Every consideration will be given to your request  consistent  with the Company's regulations"  (Exhibit  4) <br><br>"If you are unable to cover this amount in full,  send us as big an amount as you are able and we will work out an adjustment most beneficial to you." (Exhibit 5) </blockquote>We see nothing in these expressions that would indicate an intention on the insurer's part to waive the full payment of  the  overdue premium  as  prerequisite to  the reinstatement of the lapsed policy, considering  the well settled rule that a  waiver must be clear and positive,  and intent to waive  shown clearly  and  convincingly  (Fernandez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sebido,  70 Phil.  151, 159; Lang <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Sheriff<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 49 Off.  Gaz. 3323, 3329; Jocson vs. Capitol  Subdivision, Inc. G.  R. L-6573,  February 28,  1955).  The promise to give plaintiff's case every  consideration does not import any decision to renounce  the insurer's rights; and as to the "working out of an adjustment  most beneficial" to the insured, the proposal is  obviously so  vague and indefinite as to require further negotiations between  the parties, for their criteria might  differ as to what  would  be  the   most  beneficial arrangement. <br><br>Upon the  other hand, the subsequent letters of the insurance Company (Exhibits 9 and 10)  patently indicated that  the Company  insisted on  the full payment of  the premium before the policy was reinstated. <br><blockquote>"We take this opportunity of advising you that our Home Office has approved the reinstatement of your lapsed policy <span style="font-style: italic;">subject to the payment of the balance</span>  of P65.15 due on your November 1950  premium.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Kindly remit</span> this amount <span style="font-style: italic;">in order that you may once  more enjoy the benefits</span>  of insurance protection"  (Exibit 9,  April  14, 1951). <br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">We may now reinstate </span>your policy <span style="font-style: italic;">if you will kindly remit to us the balance</span> of P65.15 due on your semi-annual premium for November, 1950.   Please  send  us his  amount by return  mail  and <span style="font-style: italic;">upon  its receipt</span> we will in  turn send  the  Certificate  of  Reinstatement of your policy, <span style="font-style: italic;">thus rendering it  once again in full force and effect,"</span> (Exhibit  10, April  27, 1951)  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Clearly the Company did not consider the  partial payment  as  sufficient  consideration  for the  reinstatement. Appellant's failure to remit the balance  before the death of his wife operated  to deprive him of any right to waive the policy and recover the  face value thereof. <br><br>This  Court,  in  the case of  James  McGuire  vs.  The Manufacturer's   Life Insurance  Co.  (87  Phil.,  370,  48 Off.  Gaz. [1], 114), said: <br><blockquote>"The stipulation  in a life insurance  policy giving the insured the privilege to reinstate it upon written application does not  give the insured absolute right to such reinstatement by the mere filing of an  application.  The Company has the right to deny the  reinstatement  if it is not satined as to the insurability of the insured and if the latter does no pay  all  overdue premium and all other indebtedness to the Company.  After the death of the insured the insurance  Company cannot be compelled to entertain an application for reinstatement  of  the policy because the  conditions  precedent to reinstatement can no longer be determined and satisfied".</blockquote>Wherefore, finding no error in the judgment appealed from, we  hereby  affirm  the same,  with  costs  against appellant.  So ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,  A., Bautista Angelo,  Labrador,  Concepcion,   Endencia, </span> and  <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix,  JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span>93 Phil., 661. <br></div>
