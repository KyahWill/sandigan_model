				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract&nbsp; with defendant&nbsp; to transport between the ports of Manila and Nin Bay, Sagay, Iloilo, 2,916.44&nbsp; barrels of bulk gasoline belonging to plaintiff.&nbsp; The&nbsp; gasoline was delivered in accordance with the contract&nbsp; but defendant&nbsp; failed to transport it&nbsp; to&nbsp; its place of destination and&nbsp; so plaintiff brought&nbsp; this&nbsp; action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to recover the sum of P75,578.50 as damages.<br><div align="justify"><br>Defendant, in&nbsp; its answer,&nbsp; pleaded that its&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to deliver the gasoline was due to fortuitous event or caused by&nbsp; circumstances beyond&nbsp; its control&nbsp; and not to its fault or negligence or that of any of its employees.&nbsp; The court, after receiving the evidence,&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; decision&nbsp; finding that the disaster that had&nbsp; befallen the tugboat was the result of an unavoidable accident and the loss of the gasoline was due to a fortuitous even&nbsp; which was beyond the control of defendant and,&nbsp; consequently, dismissed the case with costs against the plaintiff.<br><br>The facts as found by the trial court are:&nbsp; "that pursuant to an agreement had&nbsp; between the parties, defendant's barge No. L-522 was&nbsp; laden&nbsp; with gasoline belonging to the&nbsp; plaintiff to&nbsp; be&nbsp; transported from Manila&nbsp; to the Port of Iloilo;&nbsp; that&nbsp; early in the morning of February 2, 1947, defendant's tugboat "Snapper'&nbsp; picked up&nbsp; the barge outside&nbsp; the breakwater; that the barge was placed behind the tugboat, it being connected to the latter by&nbsp; a tow rope ten inches in circumference; that behind the barge, three other barges were&nbsp; likewise placed, one laden&nbsp; with some cargo while the other two containing hardly&nbsp; any cargo at all; that the weather was good when on that&nbsp; day the tugboat with its tow started on its voyage; that the weather remained good&nbsp; on February 3, 1947,&nbsp; when it passed Santiago Point&nbsp; in Batangas; that at about 8:00&nbsp; o'clock in the morning of February 4,&nbsp; 1947,&nbsp; the&nbsp; engine&nbsp; of the tugboat came to a dead stop; that the engineer on board the tugboat found out that the trouble was due to a broken idler;&nbsp; that a&nbsp; message was then sent to the' defendant's radio station&nbsp; in Manila&nbsp; informing its officials .of the engine trouble;&nbsp; that upon&nbsp; the receipt of the. message the defendant called up several shipping companies&nbsp; in Manila to find out if they had any vessels in the vicinity where the "Snapper' had stalled but said companies&nbsp; replied in the negative;&nbsp; that thereupon&nbsp; the defendant radioed&nbsp; its tugboat Tamban' which&nbsp; was docked at Batangas, ordering it to&nbsp; proceed to the&nbsp; place where&nbsp; the 'Snapper'&nbsp; was; that at about&nbsp; 6:00 o'clock&nbsp; in the same morning of&nbsp; February&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1947, the master of the 'Snapper'&nbsp; attempted to cast anchor but&nbsp; the water areas around Elefante Island were so deep&nbsp; that the anchor did not touch bottom; that in the afternoon&nbsp; of&nbsp; the same&nbsp; day the&nbsp; weather become worse as&nbsp; the&nbsp; wind increased in intensity and&nbsp; the waves were&nbsp; likewise increased&nbsp; in size and&nbsp; force; that due to the rough condition of the sea the anchor chains of the 'Snapper' and the&nbsp; four barges, broke&nbsp; one by one and as a consequence thereof they were drifted&nbsp; and were finally dashed against the&nbsp; rocks&nbsp; off&nbsp; Banton&nbsp; Island; that&nbsp; on striking the rocks a&nbsp; hole was opened in the hull of the 'Snapper', which ultimately caused it to sink,&nbsp; while the barge&nbsp; No. L-522 was so badly damaged that&nbsp; the gasoline&nbsp; it had on board leaked out; and that the&nbsp; 'Tamban' arrived at the place after the gasoline had already leaked out." <br><br>Defendant&nbsp; is a&nbsp; private stevedoring company&nbsp; engaged in transporting local&nbsp; products, including&nbsp; gasoline in&nbsp; bulk and has&nbsp; a fleet of about 140 tugboats and about 90 per cent of its business is devoted to transportation.&nbsp; Though it is engaged in a limited contract of carriage in the sense that it chooses its. customers&nbsp; and&nbsp; is not opened to the public, nevertheless,&nbsp; the&nbsp; continuity of its operations in this kind of&nbsp; business have earned&nbsp; for it the&nbsp; level&nbsp; of a public utility The&nbsp; contract between the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; and defendant comes&nbsp; therefore under the provisions of the Code of Commerce.&nbsp; The pertinent law is article 361 which provides:<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 361. The merchandise shall be&nbsp; transported at the&nbsp; risk and venture&nbsp; of&nbsp; the shipper, if the contrary was not expressly stipulated.<br><br>"Therefore, all damages and impairment&nbsp; suffered by the goods during the transportation, by reason of accident, force majeure, or by virtue of the nature or defect of the articles, shall be for the account and&nbsp; risk of the&nbsp; shipper.<br><br>"The proof of these accidents is&nbsp; incumbent on the carrier.''<br></blockquote>It therefore&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; whenever&nbsp; merchandise&nbsp; is transported on the&nbsp; sea by virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; a contract entered into between&nbsp; the shipper and&nbsp; the carrier, the&nbsp; merchandies is&nbsp; deemed transported at&nbsp; the risk&nbsp; and&nbsp; venture of the&nbsp; shipper, if the&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; is not&nbsp; stipulated, and all damages&nbsp; suffered by&nbsp; the merchandise during the&nbsp; transportation by&nbsp; reason of&nbsp; accident or force&nbsp; majeure shall be for the account and risk of the shipper, but the proof of these accidents is incumbent on the&nbsp; carrier.&nbsp; Implementing this provision, our Supreme Court has&nbsp; held&nbsp; that all&nbsp; a shipper has to&nbsp; prove in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with sea&nbsp; carriage is delivery of the&nbsp; merchandise&nbsp; in&nbsp; good&nbsp; condition and&nbsp; its&nbsp; non-delivery&nbsp; at the place&nbsp; of destination in order that the&nbsp; burden of proof&nbsp; may shift to the carrier to prove any&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accidents above&nbsp; adverted&nbsp; to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was held that "Shippers who are forced to ship goods&nbsp; on an ocean liner or any other&nbsp; ship have some legal&nbsp; rights,&nbsp; and when goods are delivered on board a&nbsp; ship&nbsp; in&nbsp; good order and&nbsp; condition, and&nbsp; the shipowner delivers them&nbsp; to&nbsp; the shipper&nbsp; in&nbsp; bad&nbsp; order and condition, it&nbsp; then devolves upon the shipowner to both&nbsp; allege and prove that&nbsp; the goods were damaged by reason of some fact which legally exempts&nbsp; him&nbsp; from liability"&nbsp; ( Mirasol&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.&nbsp;</span> Robert Dollar Co.,&nbsp; 53 Phil., 129).<br><br>The&nbsp; issue to be determined is:&nbsp; Has defendant&nbsp; proven. that its failure to deliver the gasoline&nbsp; to its place of&nbsp; destination is due to accident or force majeure or to a cause beyond&nbsp; its control?&nbsp; This&nbsp; would&nbsp; require an analysis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transportation of said gasoline.<br><br>It appears that the&nbsp; tugboat "Snapper"&nbsp; was&nbsp; acquired by&nbsp; defendant from the Foreign Liquidation Commission. It was&nbsp; a surplus property.&nbsp; It was a&nbsp; deep-sea&nbsp; tugboat that had been in the service of the United&nbsp; States Armed Forces prior to its&nbsp; purchase by the&nbsp; Luzon Stevedoring Co.&nbsp; The tugboat was put into operation&nbsp; without&nbsp; first submitting it to an overhaul in a dry-dock. It also appears that this tugboat had previously made several trips and each time.it had to obtain a special permit from the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs because it had never been dry-docked and did&nbsp; not&nbsp; have complete equipment&nbsp; to be able to obtain a permanent permit.&nbsp; The special permits that were issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; said Bureau specifically state that they were issued&nbsp; "pending submission&nbsp; of plans&nbsp; and load&nbsp; line certificate,&nbsp; including test and final inspection of equipment." It further&nbsp; appears that, when&nbsp; the tugboat was&nbsp; inspected by the Bureau of Customs on&nbsp; October 18, 1946,&nbsp; it found it to be inadequately equipped and so the Bureau&nbsp; required defendant to provide it with the requisite equipment but it was&nbsp; never able to complete it.&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; the tugboat was a surplus property,&nbsp; has not&nbsp; been dry-docked, and was not&nbsp; provided with the requisite&nbsp; equipment to make it seaworthy, shows&nbsp; that defendant&nbsp; did&nbsp; not use reasonable&nbsp; diligence in putting the tugboat in such a condition as would make its&nbsp; use&nbsp; safe&nbsp; for&nbsp; operation.&nbsp; It is true, as defendant&nbsp; contends,&nbsp; that there were&nbsp; then no dry-dock facilities in the Philippines, but&nbsp; this&nbsp; does not mean that they could not be obtained elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; It being a surplus property, a dry-dock inspection was&nbsp; a must, to put the&nbsp; tugboat in&nbsp; a sea&nbsp; going condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also be true, as contended, that the deficiency in the equipment was due to the fact that no such equipment was&nbsp; available at the time, but this did not justify defendant in putting such tugboat in&nbsp; business even if unequipped&nbsp; merely to make a profit.&nbsp; Nor could&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that the tugboat was given a special permit by the Bureau of Customs to make the trip relieve defendant from liability.<br><blockquote>"Where&nbsp; owner buys old&nbsp; tug, licensed&nbsp; coastwise,&nbsp; and equips it for ocean going, it is negligence to send&nbsp; tug out without&nbsp; knowing something&nbsp; of&nbsp; her&nbsp; stability and especially&nbsp; without&nbsp; stability&nbsp; test,' where history&nbsp; and performance with respect to crankiness&nbsp; and tenderness are matters of official record.&nbsp; Sabine&nbsp; Towing&nbsp; Co vs. Brennan,&nbsp; C. C. A.&nbsp; Tex., 72&nbsp; F 2d 490, certiorari' denied 55 'S. Ct. 141, 293 U. S. 611, 79 L. Ed. 701, rehearing denied&nbsp; 55&nbsp; S. Ct. 212, 293 U. S. 632, 79 L. Ed. 717."&nbsp; (80 C.'J. Si 803&nbsp; Footnote)<br></blockquote>There are other circumstances which show the&nbsp; lack of precaution and diligence taken by defendant&nbsp; to&nbsp; make the travel of the tugboat safe. One is the failure to carry on board the necessary&nbsp; spare&nbsp; parts.&nbsp; When&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; idler was broken,&nbsp; the&nbsp; engineer of the tugboat examined it for the first&nbsp; time and it was only then&nbsp; that&nbsp; he found&nbsp; that there were no spare parts to use except a worn&nbsp; out spare driving chain. And&nbsp; the necessity of carrying such spare parts was emphasized by the&nbsp; very&nbsp; defendant's witness, Mr. Depree, who said that in vessels motored&nbsp; by diesel engines it is necessary always to carry spare chains, ball bearings&nbsp; and chain drives.&nbsp; And this&nbsp; was&nbsp; not done.<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; tug&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; to tow&nbsp; a barge&nbsp; is liable for damage to the cargo&nbsp; of the barge caused&nbsp; by faulty equipment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the tug.&nbsp; The Raleigh, D. C. Md. 50&nbsp; P. Supp.&nbsp; 961."&nbsp; (80&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.&nbsp; S. Footnote.)<br></blockquote>Another circumstance refers&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; deficiency&nbsp; or incompetence in the man power of the tugboat.&nbsp; According to law, a tugboat of the tonnage and powers of one like the "Snapper" is&nbsp; required to&nbsp; have a complement&nbsp; composed of&nbsp; one first mate, one second mate, one third mate, one chief engineer,&nbsp; one second&nbsp; engineer,&nbsp; and&nbsp; one third engineer,&nbsp; (section 1203,&nbsp; Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code); but when the trip in question&nbsp; was&nbsp; undertaken,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was only manned by&nbsp; one master, who was merely licensed as a bay, river, and lake patron, one second&nbsp; mate, who&nbsp; was licensed&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; third&nbsp; mate, one&nbsp; chief&nbsp; engineer&nbsp; who&nbsp; was licensed&nbsp; as third motor engineer, one assistant&nbsp; engineer, wh6 was licensed&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; bay, river,&nbsp; and lake&nbsp; motor&nbsp; engineer,&nbsp; and one second assistant&nbsp; engineer,&nbsp; who was unlicensed.&nbsp; The' employment of this&nbsp; crew to perform&nbsp; functions beyond its competence and qualifications is not only risky but against the law&nbsp; and if&nbsp; a mishap is caused, as in&nbsp; this case,&nbsp; one&nbsp; cannot but&nbsp; surmise that&nbsp; such incompetence has something to do with&nbsp; the mishap.&nbsp; The fact that 'the tugboat&nbsp; had&nbsp; undertaken several, trips before with practically the&nbsp; same&nbsp; crew&nbsp; without&nbsp; any untoward consequence,&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; furnish&nbsp; any&nbsp; justification&nbsp; for&nbsp; continuing in its employ&nbsp; a&nbsp; deficient or incompetent personnel contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; law&nbsp; and the&nbsp; regulations of&nbsp; the Bureau of Customs.<br><blockquote>"(1)&nbsp; Generally, seaworthiness is that strength, durability and engineering skill made a&nbsp; part of a ship's construction and continued&nbsp; maintenance, together&nbsp; with a&nbsp; competent&nbsp; and sufficient crew, which would withstand the vicissitudes and dangers of the elements which might reasonably be expected or encountered during her voyage without&nbsp; loss&nbsp; or damage/ to&nbsp; her particular cargo. The Cleveco, D.&nbsp; C. Ohio,&nbsp; 59&nbsp; P. Supp. 71, 78, affirmed, -C. C. A., 154 P. 2d 606."&nbsp; (80&nbsp; C. J. S. 997, Footnote.)<br></blockquote>Let&nbsp; us now come to&nbsp; the efforts exerted by defendant in extending help to the tugboat when it&nbsp; was notified of the breakage&nbsp; of the idler.&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence&nbsp; shows that the idler was&nbsp; broken&nbsp; at&nbsp; about 3:00 o'clock in the morning of February 4, 1947.&nbsp; Within&nbsp; a few minutes, a&nbsp; message was sent to&nbsp; defendant by radio informing it of the engine trouble.&nbsp; The weather was good at the time and the sea&nbsp; was smooth,&nbsp; and remained good until 12:00 o'clock noon when the wind&nbsp; started to blow.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to defendant, since it&nbsp; received&nbsp; the&nbsp; message,&nbsp; it called up different shipping lines&nbsp; in Manila asking them if they had any vessel in&nbsp; the vicinity where&nbsp; the&nbsp; "Snapper" stalled but, unfortunately, none was available&nbsp; at the time, and as its&nbsp; tug "Tamban"&nbsp; was&nbsp; then docked in Batangas, Batangas, which&nbsp; was nearest to&nbsp; the place,&nbsp; it radioed&nbsp; said tug to go, to the aid of the "Snapper".&nbsp; Accordingly, the tug "Tamban" set sail from Batangas for&nbsp; the rescue only to return to secure a map of the vicinity&nbsp; where the "Snapper" had stalled, which entailed&nbsp; a delay&nbsp; of two hours. In the meantime, the captain of the "Snapper" attempted to cast anchor.&nbsp; The water areas off Elefante Island were deep and the&nbsp; anchor would not touch bottom.&nbsp; Then the sea became rough and the waves increased in size and force and notwithstanding the efforts of the crew&nbsp; to prevent the tug from drifting away, the force&nbsp; of the wind and the&nbsp; violence of the waves dashed the tug and the barges against the rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tug developed a&nbsp; hole in her hull and sank.&nbsp;&nbsp; The barge carrying the gasoline was so badly damaged that the gasoline leaked out. The tug "Tamban"&nbsp; was finally able to locate the "Snapper"&nbsp; but it was too&nbsp; late.<br><br>The foregoing acts&nbsp; only serve&nbsp; to&nbsp; emphasize that the efforts made by defendant fall short of that diligence and precaution&nbsp; that are demanded by the situation to save the tugboat and the barge it was towing&nbsp; from&nbsp; disaster for it appears&nbsp; that more than twenty-four&nbsp; hours had&nbsp; elapsed before the&nbsp; tug "Tamban" showed up to extend&nbsp; help. The delay was caused not so much because of the lack of available ships in the vicinity where the "Snapper"&nbsp; stalled but because defendant did&nbsp; not have in readiness any tugboat sufficient in tonnage and equipment to attend to&nbsp; the rescue. The tug&nbsp; "Tamban" that was ordered to extend help was fully inadequate for&nbsp; that purpose.&nbsp; It was a small vessel that was&nbsp; authorized to operate only within Manila Bay and did not even have any map of the Visayan Islands. A public utility that&nbsp; is engaged in&nbsp; sea transportation even for a limited&nbsp; service with a fleet&nbsp; of 140&nbsp; tugboats&nbsp; should have a competent tug to rush for towing or repairs in the event of&nbsp; untoward happening Overseas.&nbsp; If defendant had only such&nbsp; a tug ready for such an&nbsp; emergency,&nbsp; this&nbsp; disaster&nbsp; would not have happened.&nbsp; Defendant could have avoided sending a poorly equipped tug which,&nbsp; as&nbsp; it is to be expected, failed to do job.<br><br>While the breaking of the idler may be due to an accident, or to something unexpected, the cause of the disaster which resulted in the loss of the gasoline can only be attributed to the negligence or lack of precaution to avert&nbsp; it&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of defendant.&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; had enough time to effectuate the rescue if it had only a competent tug for the purpose because the weather was good from 3:00 o'clock a.m. to 12:00&nbsp; o'clock noon of February 4, 1947 and it was only in&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon that the&nbsp; wind began to&nbsp; blow&nbsp; with some&nbsp; intensity,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]&nbsp;</sup> but&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to do so because of that shortcoming.&nbsp;&nbsp; The loss of the&nbsp; gasoline certainly cannot be&nbsp; said&nbsp; to be&nbsp; due to <span style="font-style: italic;">force majeure</span> or unforeseen event but&nbsp; to the failure of defendant to extend adequate&nbsp; and&nbsp; proper help.&nbsp; Considering these&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; and those we have discussed elsewhere, we are persuaded to conclude that defendant has failed to&nbsp; establish&nbsp; that it is exempt from liability under the law.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed.&nbsp; Defendant is hereby ordered to pay to plaintiff the sum of P75,578.50, with legal interest from the&nbsp; date of the filing of the complaint, with&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montentayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., </i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i> concur.</div></div>
