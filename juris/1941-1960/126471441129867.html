				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In an action for legal separation brought by Armando Medel   against  Rosario  Matute,  upon  the  ground  of adultery committed  with  his  brother and her  brother-in-law,  Ernesto Medel—which action was docketed as civil case No. 14190 of the Court of First Instance of Manila— decision was,  on  November  6, 1952 rendered  by  the latter,  finding  Rosario guilty  of the charge  against her, decreeing said legal separation, and  awarding to Armando the custody of their four  (4)  minor  children, Florencia, Manuel, Carmelita and Benito,  all surnamed Medel,  then 12, 10,  8 and  4 years of age, respectively.   Thereafter, Armando went to the  United  States, leaving the children in the  City of Davao  under the care of his sister Pilar Medel, in whose house Rosario subsequently lived in order to  be   with her  offspring.   Armando  returned  to  the Philippines  late in  1954.   At the close of the then current school  year, during  which the  children were  enrolled in a school in Davao,  or in March, 1955,  they joined their father  in Cebu.  With his permission, Rosario brought the  children to Manila  in  April,  1955,  to  attend  the funeral  of  her father.   Armando  alleges that he  consented  thereto  on  condition that  she would  return  the children to him within two (2)  weeks.   However,  Rosario did not do  so.  Instead, on June  10, 1955, she filed, in said civil case  No. 14190,  a motion the prayer of which is of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore, movant respectfully prays  this Honorable  Court, after due hearing:</p>
  <p>"(1) to issue  an  order awarding the custody of  the  above-named children to the  herein  movant, their mother, in deference to the  preference expressed  by the  children  (Sec.  6,  Rule  100, Rules of Court); and</p>
  <p>"(2) to order Armando  Medel, father of the said minor children, to support said children by paying their school  fees and  giving them a  reasonable allowance both items in an  amount  not less than P200 a month."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said  motion was  based  upon  the  ground  that the children—three (3)  of whom, namely, Florencia, Manuel and Carmelita, were then  16,  14 and  12  years of age, respectively—do not want to  go back  to  their  father, because he "is living with  a woman other than"  their mother.  Armando  opposed  this  motion  and countered with a petition to declare and punish Rosario for contempt of  court, in  view of her  failure  and alleged refusal  to restore the custody  of  their children to him.  After due hearing the Court of First  Instance of Manila, presided over  by  Hon. Higinio  B. Macadaeg, Judge, issued  an order, dated  June 29,  1955,  absolving Rosario  from the charge  of contempt  of  court, she having secured Armando's consent  before  bringing the children to Manila, but denying her  motion for their  custody  and ordering her to  deliver  them  to  Armando  within twenty-four  (24) hours from notice.   The  dispositive part  of said order reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In view of  the foregoing,  motion for the custody of the minor children,  Florencia,  Manuel, Carmelita, and Benito,  all surnamed Medel, is  hereby denied.  Rosario  Matute is hereby  ordered  to deliver to  Armando Medel the persons of the  said minor children, within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt of copy of  this Order. "Let copies of this Order be served  immediately by  the Sheriff of this Court,  not only on the lawyers  appearing in this case, but also on  the parties  themselves."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereupon, Rosario  instituted,  against  Armando and Judge  Maeadaeg,  the  present  action for  certiorari and prohibition with preliminary injunction, upon the ground that  said order of June 29, 1955, had  been issued with grave  abuse  of discretion,  and  that there is  no  other plain, adequate and  speedy remedy in the ordinary course of  law.   The prayer in her petition, is as  follows;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Wherefore,  petitioner respectfully prays this  Honorable Court to issue a writ of preliminary injunction upon petitioner's filing a bond  in such sum as this  Honorable  Court may fix, ordering respondents, their attorneys, agents and  other persons acting  by and under their orders to cease and desist  from enforcing in any way the order  of the respondent Court dated June 29,  1955, and after hearing, to annul the said Order and to award the custody of the children to your petitioner.</p>
  <p>"Petitioner likewise prays  for such  other or further  relief as may be just and equitable, without costs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon  the filing of the petition, we issued the  writ of preliminary injunction therein  prayed for, without bond. Briefly  stated,  petitioner  herein  maintains  that  the children should be under  her custody,  because: (1) she is their legitimate mother and they wish  to stay with her, not their father  Armando Medel; (2)  three  (3)  of the children are over ten (10)  years of age, and, hence, their aforementioned wish  must, pursuant  to Rule 100, section 6, of the Rules of Court,  be heeded, unless "the parent so chosen be unfit to take charge" of  them "by reason of moral  depravity,  habitual drunkenness,  incapacity  or poverty";  (3) the act of  infidelity of which she had been found guilty in the decision of November  6, 1952, does not involve "moral depravity";  (4)  in any event, it is a thing of the past, not a present reality; (5) respondent Armando Medel is now unfit to have the  children under his care,  for he is living maritally with a woman by the name of  Paz  Jesusa  Concepcion; and  (6)  although  he had married the  latter,  after securing in the United States a  decree of  divorce  dissolving his marriage with  petitioner herein, said decree  is null and void and, accordingly, he  is guilty  of bigamy.</p>
<p>In  the present action,  we do not deem it necessary to pass upon the merits of  such pretense.  The  case before us  is one of  certiorari  and  prohibition,  governed  by sections 1 and 2 of Rule 67 of. the Rules  of Court, reading:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Section  1. <em>Petition for certiorari.</em>—When  any  tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial  functions, has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or  with grave abuse of discretion and there is no appeal, nor any plain,  speedy,  and adequate remedy in the ordinary course  of law, a person  aggrieved  thereby may file  a  verified petition in the  proper court alleging the facts with certainty  and praying that  judgment be rendered annulling  or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal,  board, or officer as the law requires, with costs.</p>
  <p>"Sec. 2. <em>Petition for  prohibition</em>.—When the proceedings of any tribunal corporation board, or person, whether exercising functions judicial  or  ministerial, are  without or  in  excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave  abuse of discretion, and there  is  no appeal or  any other plain,  speedy,  and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,  a  person  aggrieved  thereby  may  file a verified petition in the proper court alleging  the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the defendant to desist from further proceedings in the  action or matter specified therein,  with  costs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuant  to these provisions,  neither the writ of certiorari nor that of prohibition lies unless the act  complained of has been performed "without or in excess of" jurisdiction "or with grave abuse of discretion".  There is no question but that respondent Judge had  jurisdiction to pass  upon the issue raised by  petitioner's  motion of June 10,  1955, for custody of the children, and  the  petition of respondent Medel,  dated June 22,, 1955, to declare petitioner guilty of contempt of court, to wit: whether said custody should be retained by respondent  Medel, as  adjudged  in the decision of  November 6,  1952,  or should be  given  to petitioner  herein.   Which ever  alternative taken by respondent Judge  would not  vitiate  his  choice as  being "without  or  in excess"  of jurisdiction.   Whatever  mistakes, if any, he may have committed in the appraisal  of the situation—on which  we do  not express our  view—in determining the best solution to said  issue or which one of the  litigants is best  qualified  or  least  disqualified  to take  charge  of the  children, would,  at best,  constitute "merely errors  of judgment."   They  are  not  "errors  of jurisdiction", but errors in the exercise of the jurisdiction which the lower court admittedly  had.  Such  errors do not affect  the legality or validity of the order complained of.  They may  be reviewed by appeal,  not  by  writ  of certiorari  or  prohibition.  (Comments on the Rules  of Court,  by Moran, Vol. II, pp.  167 and 168).</p>
<p>Neither does the aforementioned order of June 29, 1955, involve a grave abuse of discretion for it merely enforces the award made in  the  decision of  November 6, 1952, which is admittedly final and executory.   It is true that, insofar as  it refers to the custody of the  minor children, said decision is never final,  in the sense that it is  subject to review  at any time that the Court may deem it  for the best interest of said minors.  It  is no less true, however, that, unless and  until reviewed and modified, said award  must stand.   No  such modification having been made,  at  yet,  respondent Judge  had,   not  only  the authority;  but,  also,  the  duty to execute  and implement said award.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by virtue of said decision of  November 6, 1952, respondent  had,  admittedly, the custody of said minors.   Petitioner  merely  obtained his   permission  to bring them to  Manila, for  the  purpose of attending  the funeral of their maternal grandfather, which took place in April,  1955.  Thus, petitioner  obtained  and has  the physical possession of the minors in a precarious manner. She holds it in the name, on behalf and by authority of respondent  Medel,  whose agent  she,  in  effect,  is.  He may, therefore, demand their return  at any time, and she is bound to comply immediately with such demand.   She cannot even  question his authority to make  it, although she is  free to  seek  a review of  the order or decision awarding  the custody of the minors to him, and  to  ask that they  be placed  under her charge.</p>
<p>Again, it is conceded that children over  ten  (10) years of age, whose  parents  are  divorced  or living separately, may choose which parent they prefer to live with, unless the parent chosen is  unfit to take charge of their care by reason  of  "moral  depravity, habitual  drunkenness,  in capacity or poverty" (Rule 100, section 6, Rules of Court). Without  deciding whether   the  adultery   committed  by herein  petitioner  with her  own  brother-in-law involves moral depravity, it is clear  to our mind that the affirmative assumption implicit in the order complained of cannot be characterized as an "abuse of discretion", much less a "grave" one.</p>
<p>Lastly; said order further declares:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* *  *  The facts remains that defendant-movant is  without means of livelihood and, according to her own admission, she lives on the charily of her brothers.  She has no  home  of her own to offer to  her children, but only she  would shelter them  under the roof of her brothers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the substantial  accuracy  of this  statement  is  not contested.  We are not prepared to  hold, that  a grave abuse of discretion was committed when  the lower court impliedly  deduced,   from   these  circumstances,   that "poverty", among other causes, rendered  petitioner  unfit to take charge of her children or made it unwise to place them under her care.</p>
<p>Wherefore, without prejudice to such appropriate action as  petitioner may deem fit  to  take  for  the purpose of securing a review of the order of respondent Judge of June 29, 1955, or a modification of the award made in the decision of November 6, 1952,  relative to the custody of the children, or both, the petition is  denied  and the case dismissed.  The writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is hereby dissolved, with costs against the petitioner. It  is so  ordered.</p>
