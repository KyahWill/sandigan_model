				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In&nbsp; a petition filed on March 21, 1957, with the Court of&nbsp; Agrarian&nbsp; Relations,&nbsp; Third&nbsp; District,&nbsp; sitting at&nbsp; San Fernando, Pampanga&nbsp; (CAR Case No.&nbsp; 276-Pampanga), Felix S.&nbsp; David sought ejectment of his tenant Jose&nbsp; Rueda from his&nbsp; (David's) 5-hectare piece&nbsp; of land&nbsp; located&nbsp; in Magumbali, Candaba,&nbsp; Pampanga, being worked on by said tenant, alleging that&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenant, despite&nbsp; having received from the landowner 4 cavanes of palay for seedling and the sum of P160.00 for transplanting expenses, neglected to&nbsp; plant&nbsp; on more&nbsp; than&nbsp; 1&nbsp; hectare&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; to the damage&nbsp; and prejudice of the&nbsp; landowner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was prayed that Rueda be dispossessed&nbsp;&nbsp; of his landholding and ejected&nbsp; therefrom.<br><br>In his&nbsp; answer, Rueda claimed that his failure to plant 1 hectare of the land was attributable to causes beyond his&nbsp; control,&nbsp; specifically,&nbsp; destruction&nbsp; of the seedlings by rats and worms and for lack of water; that although he reported&nbsp; the matter&nbsp; to David's overseer, the latter did nothing about&nbsp; it; and that despite his efforts, he was not able to secure enough seedlings to&nbsp; replace those destroyed. Rueda, therefore,&nbsp; prayed that&nbsp; the petition be dismissed.<br><br>The issues having been joined, the case was first set for hearing on April 26, 1957, whereat&nbsp; the landowner and two of his witnesses testified.&nbsp;&nbsp; For lack of material time,&nbsp; the trial was continued for May 20, 1957, on which date the landowner presented one more witness and&nbsp; then rested his case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearing, however,&nbsp; was&nbsp; continued for May 27, 1957, upon&nbsp; motion of the tenant's counsel. On May&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; said&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; again moved for&nbsp; postponement of the hearing&nbsp; on&nbsp; account of his illness, which motion&nbsp; was granted&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same day by the court and the reception of the&nbsp; tenant's&nbsp; evidence was re-set for June 4, 1957, with&nbsp; warning that "no other motion for postponement will be entertained by this Court under any ground, otherwise&nbsp; the case will be submitted for decision". At&nbsp; the hearing of June 4,&nbsp; 1957, neither the tenant nor his counsel of record appeared, but the latter sent another attorney to request a further&nbsp; postponement in view&nbsp; of counsel's inability&nbsp; to inform his client of the trial for lack of material time,&nbsp; claiming that copy of the order&nbsp; setting the hearing for June 4 was&nbsp; received only on June&nbsp; 3&nbsp; at 1:00&nbsp; in the afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; On opposition of&nbsp; the landowner, the court denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; instead&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; to submit&nbsp; their respective memoranda in 10&nbsp; days after which period the case would be considered submitted for decision.<br><br>Counsel for the tenant petitioned to have this order reconsidered contending&nbsp; that such&nbsp; denial of his&nbsp; motion for postponement&nbsp; amounted to a deprivation of his day in court, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition was denied by the&nbsp; court in&nbsp; its order of June 22, 1957.<br><br>On July 2, 1957,&nbsp; the court rendered judgment&nbsp; finding tenant&nbsp; Rueda guilty of&nbsp; negligence&nbsp; in not&nbsp; plowing and preparing l-Â£ hectares of his landholding for planting despite the fact that he had already received&nbsp; the trans- planting&nbsp; expenses therefor&nbsp; thus giving rise to&nbsp; serious injury&nbsp; to the land&nbsp; which would impair&nbsp; its productive capacity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; the&nbsp; complainant Felix S. David was given authority to eject&nbsp; Rueda from his landholding and place thereon another tenant or tenants.<br><br>The decision having&nbsp; become&nbsp; final&nbsp; and&nbsp; executory,&nbsp; the court, at the instance of the&nbsp; landowner, issued a writ of execution&nbsp; dated August 12,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1957, directing&nbsp; the JAGO Tenancy Officer at San Fernando, Pampanga, to eject the tenant from the land.<br><br>Two months&nbsp; later&nbsp; or on October 15, 1957, Jose Rueda filed the present original action&nbsp; for certiorari with preliminary injunction, alleging that the&nbsp; Agrarian Court, in denying his motion for postponement of the&nbsp; hearings of June 4, 1957, acted in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, because in so doing he was deprived of&nbsp; his right to a day&nbsp; in&nbsp; court.&nbsp; Thus, he&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that a writ of preliminary injunction be issued enjoining the respondents landowner and court from ejecting petitioner from his&nbsp; landholding,&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; aforesaid order&nbsp; of June 4 be set aside and all proceedings arising therefrom, including the decision and its execution, be declared null and void.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is further prayed that the&nbsp; case be re-set for&nbsp; hearing in&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court for&nbsp; the reception of petitioner's&nbsp; evidence.<br><br>The petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; devoid&nbsp; of merit.<br><br>As stated, this is&nbsp; a special civil action for&nbsp; certiorari with&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; originally. filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; this Court.&nbsp; Hence, the only question presented&nbsp; is whether the Court of&nbsp; Agrarian Relations has, as&nbsp; alleged, acted in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioner's motion for postponement of hearing scheduled&nbsp; on June 4, 1957 and in considering the&nbsp; case submitted for&nbsp; decision. That the Court of Agrarian Relations has&nbsp; jurisdiction of the subject&nbsp; matter which&nbsp; relates to the ejectment of a tenant by the landowner is beyond question.&nbsp; That it acquired jurisdiction over the parties is likewise&nbsp; undisputed.&nbsp; Where, as in this case, there is&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; both of the&nbsp; subject-matter&nbsp; and of the parties, the decision of all&nbsp; other questions arising in the case is but an exercise of that jurisdiction&nbsp; (Herrera <i>vs.</i> Barretto, et al., 25 Phil., 245,&nbsp; 251).&nbsp;&nbsp; And certainly, the granting or&nbsp; denial&nbsp; of a motion to postpone&nbsp; the hearing of a case clearly&nbsp; within the jurisdiction of the court even if irregular or erroneous, is not overstepping&nbsp; such&nbsp; jurisdiction as to constitute&nbsp; an act "in excess of jurisdiction".&nbsp; Such an error would&nbsp; be not an&nbsp; error of jurisdiction, but merely an error of judgment which&nbsp; can not be corrected by the special civil action of certiorari.<br><br>Has&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court committed a grave abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp; its discretion in denying the verbal motion for postponement? In order to&nbsp; warrant the issuance of the writ of certiorari on the&nbsp; ground of abuse of discretion, the abuse must&nbsp; be such&nbsp; capricious&nbsp; and whimsical exercise of judgment&nbsp; as is equivalent to lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; jurisdiction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> or so&nbsp; despotic&nbsp; or arbitrary or so patent and gross as to amount&nbsp; to&nbsp; an evasion of positive duty as to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In&nbsp; the case at bar, counsel for petitioner,&nbsp; before the hearing on&nbsp; June 4,&nbsp; had&nbsp; already&nbsp; requested&nbsp; and&nbsp; obtained from&nbsp; the trial court two&nbsp; postponements, on&nbsp; May 20 and 27, 1957.&nbsp; In the order granting the&nbsp; motion for postponement and&nbsp; dictated&nbsp; in&nbsp; open&nbsp; court&nbsp; on May 27, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> after re-setting the case for hearing on June&nbsp; 4 gave&nbsp; the warning that no&nbsp; further&nbsp; postponement&nbsp; would be granted "under any ground, otherwise the&nbsp; case will be submitted for decision of&nbsp; the court".&nbsp; This evidently was in compliance with&nbsp; Section 10&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 1267, as amended, which&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"Immediately after the&nbsp; defendant has filed&nbsp; his answer to the complaint or immediately after the expiration of the time limit for the&nbsp; filing of&nbsp; an answer, the&nbsp; Court shall set the case for&nbsp; hearing and not more&nbsp; than two postponements, not exceeding a&nbsp; week each, shall be allowed for any party:&nbsp; Provided, however, that subsequent postponement shall be granted only upon any of the following special or similar reasons:<br><ol><li>When a party involves twenty or more&nbsp; persons and there is no common cause of&nbsp; action or community of&nbsp; defense;<br><br></li><li>When it&nbsp; appears upon affidavit that the&nbsp; presence of a party or witness at the trial&nbsp; is indispensable&nbsp; and&nbsp; the character&nbsp; of his illness is such as to render his&nbsp; non-attendance excusable;<br><br></li><li>When upon affidavit the materiality of evidence expected to be obtained from a party or witness is shown, and that due diligence has been used to procure it.</li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: right;">(Italics supplied). <br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div></blockquote>As stated previously,&nbsp; on June 4 neither the petitioner nor his attorney of record appeared.&nbsp; Only a representative of the latter came to court to ask for another postponement on the ground that counsel was unable to notify his client having received&nbsp; copy of the order allegedly only the day previous.&nbsp; Not satisfied with this explanation and there being no compliance with any of the three special or similar reasons provided in the above-quoted provision of&nbsp; law, the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; denied the&nbsp; petition.&nbsp; Now&nbsp; it appears in the motion for&nbsp; reconsideration filed&nbsp; on June 20, 1957,&nbsp; that since&nbsp; April 26,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; counsel had been sending letters by registered mail to&nbsp; his client, the herein petitioner, but all&nbsp; of them had been returned undelivered. Counsel therefore knew that he could not&nbsp; depend on the mails for reaching his client who was residing at barrio Salapungan, municipality of&nbsp; Candaba,&nbsp; a&nbsp; town&nbsp; only&nbsp; 18 kilometers from San Fernando, Pampanga, where counsel-holds his office.&nbsp;&nbsp; If his&nbsp; client did not appear on May&nbsp; 20 and May 27, dates previously set for the trial of the case, for which reason, among others, counsel&nbsp; had to ask for postponement, he&nbsp; should have taken&nbsp; the only logical step called for under the&nbsp; circumstances,&nbsp; and that is to send a&nbsp; messenger to contact his client.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand, the client, herein&nbsp; petitioner, if he had interest in&nbsp; prosecuting his case, should have taken pains to communicate with his lawyer to find out the status and progress of his case and not stay away from him.<br><br>As it is, considering that as early as May 20, when the respondent landowner rested his case, the&nbsp; tenant's turn to present his evidence became due, and further considering that two&nbsp; postponements extending for over two weeks, the maximum permissible under the law, had already been obtained, with warning that no further&nbsp; request for postponement on any ground would be entertained, counsel had&nbsp; no reason to rely on the liberality&nbsp; of the judge to allow another postponement, and his failure or&nbsp; inability to promptly&nbsp; notify his client&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear&nbsp; in court on the date of trial is inexcusable.&nbsp; (Bufete <i>vs.</i> Victoriano, G. R. No.&nbsp; L-10103, prom.&nbsp; March 28,&nbsp; 1957.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the circumstances of the case,&nbsp; we find&nbsp; no. justification&nbsp; to declare that the lower court acted arbitrarily or&nbsp; abusively in the exercise of its discretion so as to warrant the issuance of a&nbsp; writ of certiorari.<br><br>There is another reason why the writ of certiorari does not lie in this case.&nbsp; It is because petitioner could have availed himself of an appeal or a petition for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court for the correction of the error&nbsp; complained of, and both remedies are&nbsp; adequate. Petitioner, nevertheless, failed to take appropriate&nbsp; action in due time and when the petition for certiorari was filed on October 15, 1957, the&nbsp; respective&nbsp; periods for the&nbsp; two remedies&nbsp; had already elapsed.&nbsp; Inasmuch as the lower court has, as we already stated, jurisdiction over the case and the right to appeal has been lost by the negligence of the&nbsp; party,&nbsp; certiorari will not lie. Again, certiorari will be denied if petitioner is guilty of laches and the judgment is&nbsp; being attacked merely on the ground of lack of notice. (Melocotones <i>vs.</i> Court of First Instance, 57 Phil., 144.).<br><br>For all the foregoing, the petition for certiorari&nbsp; with preliminary injunction is hereby&nbsp; dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
