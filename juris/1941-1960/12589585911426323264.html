				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners originally&nbsp; numbering&nbsp; 45 and formerly composing&nbsp; the Democratic Labor Association and the Katubsanan&nbsp; sa Mamumuo&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; this&nbsp; action&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations on August 5, 1952, praying for&nbsp; reinstatement with&nbsp; back&nbsp; wages, direct&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of wages to the laborers instead&nbsp; of&nbsp; through the&nbsp; union,&nbsp; payment of&nbsp; accrued&nbsp; overtime&nbsp; pay&nbsp; and&nbsp; wage&nbsp; differentials, prohibition from&nbsp; carrying&nbsp; load&nbsp; in&nbsp; excess&nbsp; of&nbsp; 50&nbsp; kilos, minimum daily wage of P5.00, vacation and sick leave, free hospitalization,&nbsp; accident insurance,&nbsp; free choice of&nbsp; labor union&nbsp; and grievance&nbsp; committee.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the&nbsp; original petitioners&nbsp; only five continued to take&nbsp; interest in the action, the others having desisted therefrom.&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations ordered&nbsp; the reinstatement of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; five&nbsp; laborers to&nbsp; their former work&nbsp; and positions in&nbsp; the Sabay group,&nbsp; but&nbsp; without back wages,&nbsp; but dismissed the other claims.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not satisfied with&nbsp; this decision the&nbsp; five remaining petitioners&nbsp; have&nbsp; filed this appeal by a petition for certiorari.<br><br>The&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations made&nbsp; the&nbsp; following findings as to the manner in&nbsp; which&nbsp; the union or group to which&nbsp; the petitioners&nbsp; belong operate;<br><blockquote>"The Hijos&nbsp; de F. Escaño, Inc., hereafter referred to&nbsp; as&nbsp; Escaño or Company, is a domestic corporation engaged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; business of carrying or transporting&nbsp; passengers and&nbsp; goods&nbsp; by&nbsp; water for&nbsp; compensation within the Philippines * *&nbsp; *.<br><br>"The Katubsanan sa Mamumuo, hereafter&nbsp; called the Union or simply&nbsp; Katubsanan, is a&nbsp; labor organization&nbsp; duly&nbsp; registered&nbsp; with the Department of&nbsp; Labor and with office&nbsp; address in Cebu City it is composed mainly of laborers&nbsp; from the Visayas and Mindanao and has&nbsp; respondent Jose Muana and Vitaliano Sabay as its general president and&nbsp; general treasurer, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its members in Cebu are&nbsp; numerous&nbsp; and divided into&nbsp; several&nbsp; groups, sometimes called chapters.&nbsp; One of them is&nbsp; headed&nbsp; by respondent Sabay as its foreman or "Cabo" and known as the Sabay group.&nbsp; To this group, in which&nbsp; there are no less than&nbsp; 150&nbsp; men,&nbsp; formerly belonged some or all&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 45&nbsp; petitioners.<br><br>"The&nbsp; Sabay&nbsp; group was organized in 1947. Its members generally perform&nbsp; work&nbsp; similar to that done by laborers of stevedoring&nbsp; and arrastre&nbsp; firms.&nbsp;&nbsp; They load and unload vessels in the&nbsp; port of Cebu and haul or transport discharged cargo from the waterfront to the consignees'&nbsp; warehouses as well as&nbsp; cargo to be shipped out of <cebu from="" shippers="" warehouses="" to="" waterfront. ="" before="" petition="" was="" filed ="" court, ="" there ="" were ="" occasions="" when ="" also="" performed="" for="" certain="" persons ="" not="" parties="" to ="" the ="" case="" other ="" than="" loading, ="" unloading ="" and ="" hauling ="" cargo. ="" when  ="" petitioners ="" were="" still="" connected="" with="" the="" group,="" they="" almost="" always="" participated="" in ="" every="" work="" undertaken="" by ="" it.=""><br><br>"One&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; carriers&nbsp; for whom the Sabay&nbsp; men&nbsp; regularly serve as stevedores is the Escano.&nbsp; Their relation&nbsp; had&nbsp; its inception&nbsp; in 1947 when,&nbsp; through the&nbsp; representations made by&nbsp; Muana and&nbsp; Sabay, Salvador Sala, general&nbsp; manager&nbsp; of said carrier, permitted&nbsp;&nbsp; the Sabay group to do&nbsp; the&nbsp; work of loading and unloading&nbsp; its vessels to the exclusion&nbsp; of all&nbsp; other&nbsp; persons.&nbsp; From the beginning&nbsp; the Company has not&nbsp; directly paid&nbsp; Muana,&nbsp; Sabay or&nbsp; the group&nbsp; any compensation&nbsp; for&nbsp; the loading or unloading&nbsp; services rendered&nbsp; by Sabay men.&nbsp; Neither has it received any payment for the exclusive privilege&nbsp; enjoyed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the group.&nbsp; The&nbsp; practice which they&nbsp; have continuously&nbsp; followed is that the group collects from the shippers and&nbsp; consignees the&nbsp; charges&nbsp; for the handling&nbsp; of the&nbsp; cargo based on a schedule of rates&nbsp; which&nbsp; appears to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; previously approved by all the parties affected by the work, while the Company receives&nbsp; or&nbsp; collects&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; shippers or&nbsp; consignees&nbsp; only&nbsp; the freightage for the cargo.<br><br>"Aside&nbsp; from Sabay,&nbsp; the group has a collector,&nbsp; a timekeeper, a paymaster, and several&nbsp; capataces and subcapataces.&nbsp; The first three assist&nbsp; Sabay in&nbsp; the&nbsp; collection&nbsp; of the handling&nbsp; fees&nbsp; from&nbsp; the shippers&nbsp; and consignees, the&nbsp; recording of names of members taking part in the&nbsp; work and their working hours, and&nbsp; the payment to them of their respective shares in the earnings of&nbsp; the group.&nbsp; The capataces and sub-capataces&nbsp; help&nbsp; him&nbsp; in supervising the&nbsp; men. During the loading&nbsp; and&nbsp; unloading&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Escaño&nbsp; boats, however, the&nbsp; shipping&nbsp; manager&nbsp; of the Company, who&nbsp; is&nbsp; usually&nbsp; present, calls their&nbsp; attention&nbsp; to&nbsp; their&nbsp; work.&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; its&nbsp; checkers aid&nbsp; the&nbsp; men&nbsp; in&nbsp; determining which&nbsp; cargo to&nbsp; load&nbsp; or unload. And&nbsp; whenever expedient or necessary to finish the work immediately, they are&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; to&nbsp; use&nbsp; the different&nbsp; modern&nbsp; apparatuses&nbsp; of the vessels for the raising and&nbsp; loading of cargo.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; hauling of the cargo, checkers&nbsp; or agents of the shippers&nbsp; and&nbsp; consignees accompany them and&nbsp; look&nbsp; over&nbsp; their work.<br><br>"Generally,&nbsp; only Sabay men are&nbsp; permitted to take part&nbsp; in this work.&nbsp; But when it is voluminous, the group, to avoid delay, enlists the services of non-members.&nbsp;&nbsp; These recruits are treated as casual laborers&nbsp; and paid on&nbsp; daily&nbsp; basis.<br><br>"The amount collected from the shippers and consignees&nbsp; is considered as the gross income of the group.&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; this&nbsp; income are deducted' its expenses if any, for&nbsp; gasoline and spare parts&nbsp; of trucks used, damage to, loss or destruction of, cargo not imputable to any particular&nbsp; individual or&nbsp; individuals, meals,&nbsp; recreation,&nbsp; wages&nbsp; of casual workers, and an amount&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; two per centum for the Katubsanan for&nbsp; the maintenance of the union clinic and newspaper. The net income is then divided&nbsp; into equal shares in accordance with&nbsp; the sharing plan&nbsp; under&nbsp; which each&nbsp; common&nbsp; laborer is entitled to one&nbsp; share&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; rest,&nbsp; including the sub-capataces, capataces, Sabay and the other&nbsp; officers of&nbsp; the group, to one and one-fourth, one and&nbsp; one-half, one and three-fourths, two,&nbsp; three, or more each, depending on&nbsp; the length of&nbsp; membership&nbsp; and importance of the position held in the group.&nbsp; This&nbsp; division&nbsp; of the group's income is done every Saturday&nbsp; and the shares received by&nbsp; the participating members constitute&nbsp; their wages for the week.<br><br>"Before the&nbsp; Minimum Wage Law&nbsp; (R. A. No.&nbsp; 602)&nbsp; went into effect, the number of hours each laborer worked was not taken into account by the group. Even members who did not actually render any service were given shares&nbsp; if their failure to work was&nbsp; found to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; due to a&nbsp; reasonable cause.&nbsp; Certain&nbsp; records were made&nbsp; of&nbsp; the disposition&nbsp; of the group's income but they, together with some payrolls, were destroyed by water1 when Cebu was visited by a strong typhoon in 1951.&nbsp; After August 4, 1951, the share was given&nbsp; a fixed value:&nbsp; P0.39, at first, P0.40, later, and, finally, P0.50 per hour&nbsp; of work or service. Under this modified plan,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the computation&nbsp; would&nbsp; result in&nbsp; wages falling&nbsp; short&nbsp; of the legal minimum because there were many laborers who worked, the group collected&nbsp; additional charges from the shippers and consignees.&nbsp; If further&nbsp; payment was refused for the reason that the work was delayed&nbsp; by the workers,&nbsp; the&nbsp; group&nbsp; covered the&nbsp; deficit from its so-called&nbsp; sinking&nbsp; fund&nbsp; which&nbsp; was accumulated&nbsp; from the&nbsp; small undivided&nbsp; or indivisible amounts&nbsp; remaining after each&nbsp; distribution of net income.&nbsp; At times&nbsp; the&nbsp; laborers were rotated to obviate&nbsp; the possibility of wage shortage.&nbsp; As&nbsp; regards the expenses, whether or not they were&nbsp; deductible from the&nbsp; gross earnings&nbsp; was looked into by the auditor-bookkeeper employed by the Katubsanan.&nbsp; Since the modification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sharing plan was made, the&nbsp; group has been using&nbsp; payrolls&nbsp; printed in the name of the union."</cebu><br></blockquote>The&nbsp; court held&nbsp; that insofar as the&nbsp; stevedores loading and unloading its vessels&nbsp; are concerned, the Hijos&nbsp; de F. Escaño&nbsp; is an employer of the petitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect, however, to the arrastre&nbsp; service, it held that the question is beyond&nbsp; the scope&nbsp; of the&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; between&nbsp; it and the petitioners.<br><br>After a review of the testimonies given by the petitioners and those given on&nbsp; behalf of&nbsp; the respondents, the court below also found that the claimants failed to&nbsp; establish any reasonable basis for all&nbsp; their claims&nbsp; except that for their reinstatement and, therefore,&nbsp; denied them for lack of&nbsp; merit.&nbsp; Claims for overtime pay, wage differentials, maximum load of&nbsp; 50 kilos, minimum wage of P5.00 a day were&nbsp; dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; were the&nbsp; claims for&nbsp; vacation&nbsp; and sick&nbsp; leave,&nbsp; free&nbsp; hospitalization, accident insurance,&nbsp; and free choice of labor&nbsp; union and&nbsp; grievance committee,&nbsp; as the latter were not touched upon by the petitioners in the presentation of their&nbsp; evidence, and that&nbsp; at any rate they should be&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject of collective&nbsp; bargaining under the Industrial&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; Act.&nbsp; As to the&nbsp; reinstatement of the 5&nbsp; petitioners,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; of Eufrocio Bermiso, Fortunato Geteso, Constancio Olaco, Laureano&nbsp; Amistoso&nbsp; and Vicente Tuyogan, to their former work and positions in the Sabay group; their claims&nbsp; for back&nbsp; wages were denied.&nbsp; With respect to&nbsp; the direct payment of wages&nbsp; to the&nbsp; laborers, the court&nbsp; found that there was no&nbsp; reason for changing the practice of&nbsp; apportioning&nbsp; the wages for their&nbsp; joint labor and&nbsp; sharing therein, because&nbsp; of the&nbsp; 150 members only 5 were dissatisfied.<br><br>Petitioners argue&nbsp; before us that&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; violates the law on direct payment&nbsp; of wages.&nbsp; The law relied&nbsp; upon by&nbsp; them is Section 10, par. (b)&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 602, which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 10.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) W<ages,  including ="" wages ="" which="" may="" be="" paid ="" retroactively="" for="" whatever="" reason, ="" shall="" be ="" paid="" directly="" the="" employee ="" to ="" whom="" they="" are="" due, ="" except:="">ages, including wages which may be paid retroactively for whatever reason, shall be paid directly to the employee to whom they are due, except:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; In&nbsp; cases where the employee is insured with&nbsp; his consent by the&nbsp; employer, the latter shall be entitled&nbsp; to deduct from the wage of the employee the amount paid&nbsp; by the employer&nbsp; for premiums on the insurance;<br><br>(2)&nbsp; In&nbsp; cases of force&nbsp; majeure<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>rendering such payments&nbsp; impossible;&nbsp; and<br><br>(3)&nbsp; In&nbsp; cases where the right of the employee or his&nbsp; union to check-off&nbsp; has been recognized&nbsp; by the employer or&nbsp; authorized in writing by&nbsp; the individual&nbsp; employees&nbsp; concerned." </ages, ><br></blockquote>There
 is no question that the work of stevedoring was undertaken by the 
laborers, not in their individual capacities, but as a group.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
contract to perform the service was made&nbsp; by the leader of the group, 
for and&nbsp; on behalf of the latter, not for each and&nbsp; every one of them 
individually.&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; the sake of convenience it was necessary that the 
group must be large enough to be able to&nbsp; perform the task of loading 
and unloading in as short time as possible.<br><br>As the group undertook to render service for vessels other than those of the Hijos de F. Escaño,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; absolutely necessary that some&nbsp; sort of&nbsp; leadership be instituted in the&nbsp; group to determine which of the members&nbsp; will work for&nbsp; one vessel and which for another.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership is also essential to obtain work for the group as employers naturally prefer to deal with a leader of a group than with each member individually.&nbsp; Leadership was, therefore, essential not&nbsp; only to secure work for the group but to arrange the laborers who are to perform the service.&nbsp; The leadership must be&nbsp; paid for and it was not shown that the&nbsp; head of the&nbsp; groups got the lion's share of the cost of the&nbsp; services rendered.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the circumstances we are not prepared to say that the provision of law on direct payment of wages has&nbsp; been violated.&nbsp; The lower court did not find sufficient evidence&nbsp; to show that racketeering was employed by the leaders.&nbsp; If&nbsp; any existed the remedy can not be found in this court; it is for the&nbsp; group to&nbsp; organize&nbsp; into a closely knitted union which would secure the privileges that the members desire thru the selection of officers among themselves who would&nbsp; not&nbsp; exploit them.<br><br>Lastly, the respondent Hijos de&nbsp; F.&nbsp; Escaño did&nbsp; not pay for the stevedoring charges.&nbsp; These were collected by the group from the shippers themselves, without the intervention of the respondent&nbsp; Escaño.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can the court order the latter to&nbsp; pay the charges to the group or its members, when the&nbsp; charges&nbsp; were collected by the latter&nbsp; from&nbsp; the shippers, in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; practice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the group itself?<br><br>We&nbsp; also find no ground for requiring the respondent Hijos&nbsp; de F.&nbsp; Escano to&nbsp; pay back wages. The latter respondent did not&nbsp; deal with&nbsp; the petitioners individually, entering into a contract of employment with them.&nbsp; Said respondent dealt with&nbsp; the group thru its leaders.&nbsp; If the group, thru&nbsp; its leaders, did not allow&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners to work and share&nbsp; in the price&nbsp; paid&nbsp; therefor, the&nbsp; one&nbsp; responsible is not the respondent Escaño but the leader thru whom the group&nbsp; itself made the&nbsp; contract for work&nbsp; and apportioned the time of work for each member and the pay therefor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again&nbsp; as stated&nbsp; above, the remedy&nbsp; must be sought not in&nbsp; the tribunals of the country but&nbsp; in the laborers themselves who should organized and thru such organization as they may&nbsp; establish,&nbsp; as envisioned&nbsp; by the Industrial Peace Act, secure the privileges demanded.<br><br>The third&nbsp; error attributed to the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below&nbsp; is&nbsp; its denial of the other claims,&nbsp; such as&nbsp; vacation and sick leave, accident,&nbsp; insurance, free&nbsp; hospitalization,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; We agree with&nbsp; the court below&nbsp; that&nbsp; these&nbsp; matters&nbsp; must also be sought for thru&nbsp; labor organizations,&nbsp; which&nbsp; should take them up&nbsp; with their employers&nbsp; thru&nbsp; collective bargaining.<br><br>The&nbsp; decision subject of&nbsp; review is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed. Without costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
