				<H3>JOSE B. VILLACORTA, ETC., PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE, FERNANDO VILLAROSA, ETC.,  ET AL., RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is  an appeal from the decision of  the Court of First  Instance of  Rizal,  Branch VII, Pasay  City,  promulgated in a proceeding for certiorari and mandamus with preliminary injunction, setting  aside  the order  of the respondent municipal judge denying permission to a prosecution  witness  whose name was  omitted from the list of witnesses appearing in the information to testify in a criminal  case  in  the  Municipal Court  of Pasay  City, Branch II.</p>
<p>An  examination  of the  information shows  that there is at the bottom a list of names and at the end are added the words  "and  other  witnesses."  It appears that the reason for not indicating the name of the particular witness in the list is the fear of the city  attorney that  said witness, who is material, may be approached and tampered by  the accused.  The only  issue, therefore is  whether a prosecution witness,  whose name does  not appear in the list of witnesses may still  be called  upon  to testify.</p>
<p>We  have already held in  a long line of decisions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> that the prosecution is allowed  to  call  witnesses  other than those named in the complaint or information.  We see no reason  to deviate from said rule.  Section 1,  Rule 112 of the Rules of Court expressly permits the prosecution to present  an  unlisted witness at the  trial and there  is nothing in  said section which requires the previous consent of the court before the  prosecution can present such witness.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the  judgment appealed  from  is  hereby affirmed with  costs  against  respondents-appellants  other than respondent-appellant Judge, Municipal  Court, Pasay City.   So ordered.</p>
<em>Bengzon, Padilla,  Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Gutierrez David,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.,</em> concur.<br>
