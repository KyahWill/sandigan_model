				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal from&nbsp; a judgment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court or First Instance&nbsp; of Manila dismissing&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; (civil No. 27852).&nbsp; The facts are not disputed, the appellant having signified his intention to raise&nbsp; questions of law principally and questions&nbsp; of fact incidentally.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his brief, the appellant does not&nbsp; question the&nbsp; findings of fact of the trial court.<br><blockquote>This case&nbsp; involves the ownership&nbsp; of a parcel of land and the improvements existing thereon consisting of a two-story&nbsp; building of strong&nbsp; materials situated at&nbsp; Nos. 601 &amp; 603&nbsp; Isabel (Corner F. Jocson Streets,&nbsp; Sampaloc,&nbsp; Manila, and more particularly described as follows:<br><br>"PARCELA&nbsp; DE TEBRENO No. 14 Manzana No.&nbsp; 124 de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Subdivision de Solucan, con la casa de dos plantas de materiales fuertes,. sefialada con los Nos. 803 al 307 de la Calle Isabel.&nbsp; Linda por el SE, con la Calle Feliciano Jocson; por el SW, con la parcela 28r por el NW,&nbsp; con la parcela 13;&nbsp; y por&nbsp; el NE,&nbsp; con. la&nbsp; Calle Isabel,. conteniendo Una extension superficial de CIENTO OCHIENTA Y SIETE: METROS CUADRADOS CON CINCUENTA DICIMETROS (187.50).<br><br>At&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the attorneys for&nbsp; both parties entered into the following partial stipulation of facts:<br><br>"1. That&nbsp; they&nbsp; agree&nbsp; on the identity, location&nbsp; and description of the property in question as described in Par.&nbsp; 3 of the complaint and that they likewise agree on the identity of the parties, plaintiff and defendants;<br><br>"2. That the plaintiff paid to the City Treasurer&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila the sum of P611.80 on April 2, 1949, under Official Receipt No. 63220-V certified copy&nbsp; of&nbsp; which receipt is&nbsp; hereto attached&nbsp; as Annex&nbsp; 'A'; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P850.00 on January&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1950,&nbsp;&nbsp; as per&nbsp; official&nbsp; receipt No.&nbsp; 380415-V, hereto&nbsp; attached as&nbsp; Annex 'A-1'; and the&nbsp; sum of P368.49 on May 4, 1950, as per official receipt Â«No. 528339-V, hereto attached as Annex 'A-2';<br><br>"3. That the property in question is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 63708,&nbsp; issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; Marcelina&nbsp; David, predecessor-in-interest of the defendants, from whom the latter inherited said property,&nbsp; which Transfer&nbsp; Certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Title&nbsp; is in the possession&nbsp; of the defendants; and<br><br>"4. That&nbsp; all other facts not covered by this stipulation of facts shall be covered by evidence which the parties may&nbsp; wish to&nbsp; adduce in court."<br><br>It&nbsp; appears that the same&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land&nbsp; and its improvements were the subject-matter of the litigation&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 948 of this&nbsp; Court between Julian M. Manansala&nbsp; and Marcelina&nbsp; David, predecessor-in-interest of the herein defendants, in which said plaintiff;&nbsp; sought to annul two&nbsp; documents,&nbsp; the one a deed of sale&nbsp; and conveyance of&nbsp; said property and the other, a contract of lease and option to repurchase the same property, on the ground that&nbsp; they did not express&nbsp; the true&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the parties. During&nbsp; the pendency of said action, Marcelina&nbsp; David died&nbsp; and she, was&nbsp; substituted by the herein defendants&nbsp; as&nbsp; her heirs. In (a) decision rendered&nbsp; by this Court on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 7, 1950, the defendants were absolved from the complaint and the plaintiff was ordered to vacate said property and to pay the former the sum of&nbsp; P96.00 a month as rant&nbsp; therefor,&nbsp; beginning September 24, 1941, until the premises were surrendered to the defendants by the plaintiff.&nbsp; This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on April&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1955.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>It further appears that during&nbsp; the pendency of said civil case No. 948, in this Court and in the Court of Appeals, the land taxes for said property corresponding to the years 1945,&nbsp; 1946, 1947, and 1948,&nbsp; inclusive,&nbsp; were not&nbsp; paid,&nbsp; because of which, it was among those&nbsp; that were&nbsp; advertised&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Bagong Balita in its issues of March 2, 9 and&nbsp; 16, 1948, which were to be sold at public auction on April 2, 1948. However,&nbsp; at the public auction held on the date aforesaid, there was no bidder for said property.<br><br>On&nbsp; September 14, 1948,&nbsp; the plaintiff Julian M.&nbsp; Manansala; as the declared owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; said property in the tax&nbsp; rolls in the&nbsp; office of the City Treasurer&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; was&nbsp; notified by&nbsp; the latter that the same&nbsp; was forfeited&nbsp; to&nbsp; the City&nbsp; in the&nbsp; public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; sale conducted by him on April&nbsp; 2, 1948, and informed him that he had one year&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; sale&nbsp; within which to&nbsp; redeem said property.&nbsp; On April 2,&nbsp; 1949, or before&nbsp; the expiration of said one year,&nbsp; plaintiff Julian&nbsp; M. Manansala&nbsp; entered into a&nbsp; compromise agreement (Exhibit "C") with the City Treasurer of the City of Manila, as follows:<br><br>"I&nbsp; hereby acknowledge&nbsp; to be&nbsp; indebted to&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Treasurer of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; for&nbsp; real&nbsp; estate&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; charges due&nbsp; on my property at 405&nbsp; Isabel and F. Jocson, Sampaloc, which was forfeited at the&nbsp; tax sale&nbsp; conducted by the office of the City Treasurer on April 2,&nbsp; 1948, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; total&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P1,424.25,&nbsp; which I hereby promise to settle in the following manner:<br><br>"The&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P611.80&nbsp; to be&nbsp; paid at&nbsp; this writing&nbsp; and the balance of P812.45, 30&nbsp; days&nbsp; hereafter.<br><br>"I&nbsp; hereby further agree&nbsp; that should I&nbsp; fail to pay the amount of P812.45&nbsp; on or before the time limit given the City Treasurer is given full authority to confiscate the said&nbsp; property and to take such&nbsp; action as he may deem necessary on the premise."<br><br>On the same&nbsp; date, plaintiff paid to the&nbsp; City Treasurer&nbsp; the sum of P611.80 under Official Receipt No.&nbsp; 63220-V.<br><br>It&nbsp; seems, however, that the plaintiff failed to comply with said compromise agreement because on August 3, 1959, the City Treasurer invited his attention to his letter of May 10,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; arid to&nbsp; the compromise agreement&nbsp; signed by him of April&nbsp; 2, 1949, in connection with&nbsp; the payment of the balance of P812.45 which he promised&nbsp; to pay within 30 days from April 2, 1949, otherwise the City Treasurer would "proceed with the confiscation of the property in accordance with&nbsp; the provisions of&nbsp; the Revised Charter, of the&nbsp; City of Manila" (Exhibit "I").&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 21, 1949, another demand was made upon the&nbsp; plaintiff by&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Treasurer, who&nbsp; gave him 10 days from his&nbsp; receipt of the letter&nbsp; within which to pay said balance "in order to&nbsp; avoid&nbsp; the outright confiscation of the property".&nbsp; On January 3, 1950, plaintiff paid to the City Treasurer the sum&nbsp; of P850.00 under Official Receipt&nbsp; No. 380415-V, and on May 4, 1960, he paid the balance of P368.49 under Official Receipt No. 528339-V. Upon his payment of the last amount, the City&nbsp; Treasurer issued in his&nbsp; favor a certificate&nbsp; of repurchase (Exhibit "A") which reads as follows:<br><br>"This&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp; certify that&nbsp; the land&nbsp; and&nbsp; improvements located at No. 405 Isabel and 251 F.&nbsp; Jocson (Lot 14, Block 124),&nbsp; forfeited to the&nbsp; City of Manila,&nbsp; at the&nbsp; public sale conducted by the undersigned, on April-2, 1948, has&nbsp; been repurchased by&nbsp; Mr. Julian M. Manansala.<br><br>"The amount of P1,828.49 representing taxes, penalties and&nbsp; costs, including&nbsp; interest,&nbsp; was paid&nbsp; under Official&nbsp; Receipts Nos.&nbsp; 63220, 380415 and&nbsp; 528339,&nbsp; dated April 4, 1949, January&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1950, and May 4, 1950, respectively."<br><br>Plaintiff now alleges in his&nbsp; complaint that&nbsp; by virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Exhibit "A", he&nbsp; "acquired and&nbsp; became the absolute legal owner" of said property.&nbsp; He&nbsp; proceeds upon&nbsp; the theory that when the property in question was&nbsp; advertised for sale&nbsp; at public&nbsp; auction for tax delinquency on April 2, 1949,&nbsp; and there&nbsp; was no bidder for&nbsp; it at said auction, said property&nbsp; was forfeited to the City of&nbsp; Manila; and that&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants and&nbsp; their&nbsp; predecessor-in-interest failed to exercise their right of&nbsp; redemption within the&nbsp; period prescribed by law, said forfeiture was&nbsp; rendered absolute and property passed to the ownership of the City of Manila.<br></blockquote>Section&nbsp; 72,&nbsp; Republic Act&nbsp; No. 409,&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>In case there is no bidder at the&nbsp; public sale of such realty who offers a sum sufficient to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; taxes, penalties, and costs, the city assessor&nbsp; and&nbsp; collector shall declare the real estate forfeited to the city, and shall make, within two days thereafter, a return of his proceedings and the forfeiture, which shall be spread&nbsp; upon the records of his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(1)</sup><br></blockquote>Section 73&nbsp; of the same Act&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>Within one year from the date of such forfeiture thus declared the taxpayer, or anyone for him, may redeem&nbsp; said realty as above provided in cases where the same is sold.&nbsp; But,&nbsp; if the realty is not&nbsp; thus redeemed&nbsp; within the&nbsp; year,&nbsp; the forfeiture&nbsp; shall&nbsp; become absolute and the city treasurer shall execute a deed, similar&nbsp; in&nbsp; form as haying the same effect&nbsp; as the deed required to be made&nbsp; by him in case of a sale, conveying the real estate to the city.&nbsp; The&nbsp; deed shall be recorded as&nbsp; required&nbsp; by law&nbsp; or other real estate&nbsp; titles and shall then&nbsp; be forwarded to the mayor for notation&nbsp; and return to the city treasurer who shall file the same and enter it in his records of property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>As found by the trial court,&nbsp; the&nbsp; property in, question was declared in the name of the appellant for purposes of taxation.&nbsp; During the pendency of the case&nbsp; between him and the appellees' predecessor-in-interest, the realty&nbsp; tax due on the property for the years&nbsp; 1945, 1946, 1947 and 1948 were&nbsp; not paid and for&nbsp; that reason&nbsp; the same&nbsp; was advertised for sale&nbsp; at public auction on 2 April 1948 in the Bagong Balita.&nbsp; As there was no bidder&nbsp; at the public sale, it was declared forfeited to the City of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 14 September 1948 the appellant&nbsp; was&nbsp; notified of&nbsp; that fact by the City Treasurer of&nbsp; Manila and&nbsp; that&nbsp; he had one year from the date of forfeiture within&nbsp; which to redeem the property.&nbsp; On 2 April 1949 the appellant entered into a&nbsp; compromise agreement with the&nbsp; City Treasurer for the redemption of the property.&nbsp; After several extensions of time within which to pay the amounts due,&nbsp; the appellant finally made good his promise and&nbsp; undertaking. On 9 May 1950&nbsp; the City Treasurer&nbsp; issued a "Certificate of Repurchase" in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; The appellant did not purchase the property at the&nbsp; public sale conducted on 2 April 1948, for nobody&nbsp; bid for&nbsp; it, but within one year from date of&nbsp; forfeiture&nbsp; he, as declared owner,&nbsp; redeemed the property to prevent the loss of whatever right he might have in&nbsp; it, which&nbsp; was then&nbsp; under&nbsp; litigation between him and the appellees' predecessor-in-interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; As correctly held by the trial court Exhibit A is not the tax deed mentioned in section 71 of Republic Act No. 409, which&nbsp; must&nbsp; be "inform&nbsp; and effect sufficient to convey to the purchaser so much of the real estate against which the taxes have been assessed&nbsp; as&nbsp; has&nbsp; been sold, free from all liens of&nbsp; any kind whatsoever, and the deed shall succinctly recite all&nbsp; the proceedings upon&nbsp; which the validity of the sale depends." The tax deed contemplated in section 71 is that issued to a third person who buys the property at the public sale after the owner or anybody in his behalf&nbsp; has failed to&nbsp; redeem it&nbsp; within one year from the date&nbsp; of sale.&nbsp; To sustain the appellant's contention would in effect nullify the final judgment rendered by the Court of Appeals holding that the appellee's prerecessors-in-interest was the owner of the property in question and the judgment of this Court in G. R. No. L-10223 on 29 August 1957 upholding the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The appellant contends&nbsp; that the appellees cannot assail the validity of the tax sale in his&nbsp; favor because they did not comply with the provisions of&nbsp; section 77, Republic Act No. 409,&nbsp; by paying into court the amount for which the real estate was&nbsp; sold together with interest thereon at the rate of 15 per cent per annum from the date of sale to the time of the filing of the action.&nbsp; That section applies only when it is the owner of the land himself who assails the validity of the tax sale recover the property sold to a third person or forfeited to the City of Manila and&nbsp; not when, as in the case at bar, the property has not been lost or sold to a third person but redeemed by another in behalf of the true&nbsp; owner and the&nbsp; redemptioner claims ownership&nbsp; over it&nbsp; by virtue of his redemption.<br><br>However, considering that by redeeming the property in question from the City of Manila&nbsp; the appellant had prevented its loss to the prejudice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellees, he should be reimbursed by the appellees&nbsp; for whatever amount he had paid to the City of Manila for its redemption, with lawful interest from the time of payment to the&nbsp; City of Manila to the date&nbsp; of reimbursement to the appellant.<br><br>With the foregoing modification, the judgment appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed, without pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
