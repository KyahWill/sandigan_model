				<H3>JEAN V. PLUMELET, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT, VS. MORALES SHIPPING CO., INC., RESPONDENT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Review on certiorari of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the award of 
P14,200 with legal interest, made by the Manila court of first instance in favor 
of herein respondent and against Jean V. Plumelet.
<p>According to the appellate court,</p>
<p>On May 31, 1948 the Morales Shipping Co., Inc., a corporation engaged in 
coastwise shipping employed Jean V. Plumelet as an agent to secure cargo for its 
vessels, "upon condition that the bills Of lading were to be in the name of 
appellee as carrier. On or about June 11 of the same year appellant informed the 
manager of appellee that he had secured cargo from the Bureau of Public Works, 
consigned to the district engineer of Marinduque, at Boac, to be loaded on board 
the <em>MV San Vicente</em>. Pursuant to his request, the said vessel was docked 
alongside Muelle de la Industria on the following day, at 7:00 a.m., and was 
actually loaded with cargo consisting of bridge spans and parts, the loading of 
which was accomplished within the agreed period of 24 hours. The stipulated 
freight was the sum of P4,500. The evidence discloses that appellant made the 
contract with the Bureau of Public Works in his own name, without disclosing his 
principal nor the fact that the vessel on which the cargo was to be loaded 
belonged to appellant. It also appears that the corresponding bill of lading 
issued in the name of appellant made it appear that the latter was the owner of 
the vessel on which the cargo was to be loaded. Due to these circumstances, 
appellee demanded from appellant, as a measure of self-protection, that the 
freight be paid in advance, that is, before the sailing of the vessel. 
Appellant, however, was unable to make payment as demanded and asked that he be 
given time to raise the necessary money. For this reason the cargo in question 
remained on board from June 12, 1948 to July 21, of the same year, during which 
time appellant unsuccessfully tried to raise the needed money. He finally gave 
up and was constrained to unload the cargo from the vessel on the last mentioned 
date."</p>
<p>The record shows that on June 17, 1948 the respondent wrote herein petitioner 
demanding payment of the freight plus demurrage for four days, and indicating 
its unwillingness to unload the cargo unless payment was made. (Annex B of 
complaint.) It also shows that on June 18, 1948 respondent wrote to the Bureau 
of Public Works, the letter Exhibit I saying partly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The vessel San Vicente has been alongside the Muelle de la Industria, since 
8:00 a.m. on Friday the 12th of June, and was completely loaded by you by Monday 
evening June 14, but has been delayed until now pending some sensible agieement 
between the Bureau and ourselves. Unfortunately, in the meantime we will have to 
retain a lien upon this cargo."</p></blockquote>
<p>On July 1, 1948, said shipping corporation filed its complaint which, as 
amended, sought to recover from Plumelet on three causes of action: (<em>a</em>) 
value of freightage, P4,500; (<em>b</em>) demurrage for delaying the ship's 
departure at the rate of P400 per day, or a total of P14,200 and (<em>c</em>) 
damages in the amount of P12,000 for its inability to accept cargo for shipment 
offered by the Atlantic Gulf &amp; Refining Co.</p>
<p>After due hearing, the Manila court found the first and third claims to be 
unjustified, and dismissed the same. However, on the second cause of action, 
demurrage, it rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the amount demanded, with 
legal interest from July 1, 1948. </p>
<p>Plumelet appealed to the Court of Appeals; the Morales Shipping Co., Inc. did 
not; wherefore only one question was submitted to the appellate Court: 
Plumelet's liability for demurrage.</p>
<p>Articles 652, 656, 689 and 691 of the Code of Commerce speak of demurrage: an 
amount stipulated in the charter party to be paid to the shipowner for any delay 
in the sailing of his ship. It is payable by the charterer or shipper.</p>
<p>But Plumelet <em>was not the charterer nor shipper</em>. He was an agent of 
the shipowner, as was expressly found by the Court of Appeals. Hence, demurrage 
is not by law chargeable to him.</p>
<p>It is alleged however that being responsible for the delay of the vessel's 
departure, he is liable for damages. Admitting for the moment, that he must pay 
damages, such damages <em>have to be proven</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Except where the law authorizes the imposition of punitive or exemplary 
damages, a party claiming damages must establish by competent evidence the 
amount of such damages, and courts cannot give judgment for a greater amount 
than that actually proven." (Marker <em>vs</em>. Garcia, 5 Phil., 657; Sanz 
<em>vs</em>. Lavin, 6 Phil., 299; Rubio <em>vs</em>. Rivera, 41 Phil., 39.)</p>
<p>"The Civil Code has made no provision for nominal nor punitive damages." 
(Algarra <em>vs</em>. Sandejas, 27 Phil., 284.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The amount of demurrage stipulated or supposed to be stipulated between 
shipowner and shipper may rot be legally charged to Plumelet, for the simple 
reason that <em>he had not agreed</em> to pay it. The courts below held 
erroneously that such rate of demurrage was chargeable to him.</p>
<p>But, was he responsible for the delay? As stated at the beginning, because 
the freightage had not been paid in advance, Plumelet was given by the shipowner 
time to raise the necessary money. There is no finding that Plumelet, as agent, 
had been instructed previously by his principal to collect the freight charges 
in advance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In fact the Court of 
Appeals impliedly found that no such instruction had been given, when it said 
"if such agreement was not a part of the original contract, appellant accepted 
the condition when the demand therefor was made * * * and then asked for time to 
look for money". Now, supposing this acceptance (by petitioner) was a question 
of fact<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> on which we are concluded by 
the appellate court's statement, still we find it difficult to conclude that he 
also agreed that <em>in case he failed to get money, he would pay 
damages</em>—and at the rate of demurrage at that. And as no period was fixed 
within which Plumelet should produce the money (and the freight kept aboard 
pending production of the money), when he finally gave up, it was a case of 
damages without legal wrong, loss without injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Damages <em>both</em> to the shipowner and 
to Plumelet (who lost his commission) for which no recovery can be had by 
either. Morales Shipping Co. can allege no wrong, because it <em>had agreed</em> 
to give Plumelet time to look for money— and the latter looked for it. In fact 
as petitioner contends, it "assumed the risks of petitioner failing to raise 
money for advance freightage."</p>
<p>The resultant juridical situation is the same as if Plumelet, having 
previously been instructed to require freight in advance, found no shippers 
willing to advance. Obviously the agent on commission basis will not be 
responsible to his principal for damages if he fails to find business for such 
principal.</p>
<p>It might be argued that as the period was not fixed (for producing the 
money), a <em>reasonable time</em> must be understood. Granted 
<em>arguendo</em>. Four days would not be an unreasonable period. At the end of 
it the shipping company could have unloaded when the freightage was not 
forthcoming—and then sailed. But it chose to retain the cargo and wait. It even 
gave notice to Plumelet in its letter Annex B, that it <em>would not unload 
it</em>, unless demurrage was paid for the four days. Now then, it being clear 
that said shipping company had no right to damage for the four days (reasonable 
time to look for money), the retention of the cargo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3a]</sup>—and delay of vessel's departure—was no 
longer imputable to Plumelet, since he had not prevented—could not have 
prevented—the shipowner from unloading it, and sailing, and such retention took 
place because the shipowner asserted <em>erroneously</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> that it had a right to demurrage.</p>
<p>Apparently the respondent's case rests on this implicit proposition: had 
Plumelet not issued the bill of lading in his own name <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>—instead of the shipowner—the Morales 
Shipping Company would not have demanded payment in advance "as a matter of 
self-protection", and no delay would have happened. However it may be asked: 
protection against what? Evidently not against failure or refusal of the Bureau 
of Public Works to pay the freight. Most probably against the possibility of 
said Bureau's directly paying to Plumelet, and the latter's pocketing the whole 
amount. Yet that contingency could easily have been remedied, without advance 
payment: After ascertaining from the Bureau that the freightage had not been 
advanced, Morales Shipping Company could have undertaken the trip to Boac, after 
notifying the Bureau, and the General Auditing Office, in writing that it was 
transporting the cargo, that it was the owner of the vessel, that Plumelet was 
merely its agent and that payment should be made directly to it—and not to 
Plumelet. Morales Shipping would have run no risk, because the law preserved its 
lien on the goods loaded and transported; and Morales Shipping Company actually 
<em>knew that law</em>. (See Annex B of complaint.)</p>
<p>Let it not be argued, in this connection, that inasmuch as Plumelet as agent 
had not disclosed the principal, the latter had no claim against, and therefore 
could not have directly addressed the Bureau; because the vessel belonged to 
Morales Shipping Company and it could claim against the shipper, under article 
1717 of the Civil Code, especially after the latter had been advised of such 
ownership. And in fact said shipping company communicated with the Bureau on the 
shipment.</p>
<p>Wherefore the shipowner's demand for prepayment seems to be an unwarranted 
precaution, and the delay should not be chargeable to Plumelet. Unless the 
latter expressly or impliedly agreed to pay for it—which he did not.</p>
<p>Neither may Plumelet be made responsible on account of his having made the 
contract in his own name instead of the principal's; because supposing he was 
actually instructed <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> to make the 
contract (bill of lading) in the name of the shipping company,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the latter <em>waived</em> such 
irregularity when it <em>agreed to carry</em> the cargo, provided freightage was 
advanced. Obviously both parties hoped that Plumelet could persuade the shipper 
to advance the freightage or could secure money somewhere else; but he failed, 
after trying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <em>Damnum absque 
injuria</em> as explained hereinbefore.</p>
<p>Looking at the matter from the angle most favorable to plaintiff, the most 
that may be said is that Plumelet promised to produce the money, not only to 
try; i.e., he made an absolute promise to pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> But then he will be liable for damages 
only <em>if he defaulted</em>. And he could not have defaulted because no 
deadline had been fixed. And supposing he defaulted, the only amount of damages 
recoverable for the delay would be legal interest of P4,500 it being the rule in 
this jurisdiction that "in the absence of fraud or stipulation, the only damages 
collectible for non-payment of money are limited to interest—legal 
interest".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p>
<p>For the reasons herein explained, the decision under review is reversed and 
the petitioner absolved from liability. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Freightage need not be prepaid, 
because shipowner may retain cargo at port of destination, until freightage is 
paid. </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Might be a question of law. </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <em>Damnum absque injuria</em>. 
See 17 C. J., 1125; Gilchrist <em>vs</em>. Cuddy, 29 Phil., 542. </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3a]</sup> Even if Plumelet owed demurrage, 
cargo could not be legally retained, because <em>he did not own it</em>. </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Not to say, out of cupidity. </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This is debatable, the bill of 
lading Exhibit G being authority to "L.C.T. San Vicente M, Captain J. V. 
Plumelet" to transport the goods; and the receipt being signed by "J. Loderico 
(captain)." Loderico was probably captain of San Vicente, and the bill could be 
considered issued in the name of the vessel and of shipowner. (Cf. Wing Kee 
<em>vs</em>. Monangahela, 44 Phil., 464.) </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Ordinarily an agent may contract 
either in his own name or in that of the principal. </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The letter of Annex A, the 
shipping company authorizing him to look for cargoes <em>did not so 
specify</em>. True its letter Annex B says "we authorized you to negotiate 
cargoes * * * in our name". But that letter was issued June 17, after the 
cargoes had already been loaded (and the contract presumably signed) on June 12. 
</p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It is probable that upon receipt 
of the shipowner's letter Exhibit I, the Bureau of Public Works became doubly 
reluctant to advance the freightage to Plumelet. </p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He was absolved on the first cause 
of action to recover this amount, however; and respondent did not appeal. </p>
