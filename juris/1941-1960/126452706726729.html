				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On May 24,  1945, Benedicto Jose  y Santos was accused of a violation of article  159 of the Revised Penal Code in an information filed  by the City Fiscal  of  Manila, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about some time prior to April 19, 1944, the  said accused was prosecuted and convicted in Criminal Case No.  3 of the Court of Special  and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction of the  City of Greater Manila, for a violation of section 8  (6)  and 2 (6)  of  Act No. 65 of the National Assembly of the Republic of the Philippines in connection  with section 11 of Ordinance No. 1 of the President of said  Republic, and  sentenced  to ten years of imprisonment, which sentence  he commenced  to serve on  the  aforesaid date, April 19, 1944.</p>
  <p>"That after serving about six  months of his sentence aforesaid, the said accused was, on October 15, 1944, granted a pardon by the President  of  the  Republic  of the Philippines,  on.  condition that the said accused should  not again violate any  of the Penal Laws of the Philippines, a condition which was duly accepted  by him, for which reason he was immediately released from  confinement.</p>
  <p>"That some time  prior to April  5, 1945, the said accused, while enjoying the  conditional pardon granted him  as aforesaid, did willfully, unlawfully  and feloniously violate the condition of said pardon, by then commiting1, in the City  of Manila,  Philippines, the crime of qualified theft, for which he was prosecuted, convicted and  sentenced in  Criminal Case No. A-605 of the Municipal Court  of  said city,  the said accused having been  received on the  said date, April 5, 1945, at the new Bilibid  Prison to serve the said sentence imposed upon him.  Contrary to law."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defendant filed a  motion to  quash the information upon the  ground that  the facts charged  do not constitute an offense, because both the judgment rendered by the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction and the conditional pardon granted by the President of the so-called Republic  of the Philippines, are void and without legal effect in accordance with the proclamation of General Douglas MacArthur of October 23, 1944; because, even without such proclamation, the proceedings of said court would be null and void inasmuch as it was exclusively a creature and an  agency of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines and the motives behind its creation are diametrically opposite to the political policies of the present regime; and because the  fundamental constitutional rights guaranteed by  the Constitution of the Commonwealth were denied an accused under the procedure adopted by said court.  Defendant alleged as  a further ground for his motion to quash that the court has  no jurisdiction to  try the case because it has no  authority to take cognizance of and continue to final judgment proceedings commenced  and pending in the  courts  under the so-called  Eepublic  of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The City  Fiscal opposed this motion  to quash on the ground that  "there should  be no question as to the legality of  the sentence  imposed  upon him  (defendant)  by the said Court of Special and  Exclusive Criminal  Jurisdiction and the pardon granted him after serving six months of his sentence  by the then President of the defunct Republic because, as said  before, the defunct Republic being a <em>de facto</em> government, the courts created  by it as well as the laws and  ordinances under it should be upheld as being legal  in conformity  with the principles  of  International Law as elicited in the case of Williams <em>vs.</em> Bruffy (26 U. S. 176, 185; 25 Law. ed., 716), which, among other things, says (referring to <em>de facto</em> government)  'its legislation  is in general recognized and the rights acquired under it are with few  exceptions respected after the restoration of the authorities which  were expelled.' "</p>
<p>The court, after considering both the motion to quash and the  opposition thereto, rendered a resolution dismissing the case with costs <em>de oficio</em>.   In  said resolution the court held: first, that the facts alleged in the information constitute no offense, because article  159 of the Revised Penal Code punishes one convicted by a court of the legitimate or the Commonwealth Government, who violates a conditional pardon granted him by the  Chief Executive, that is, the Governor General or his legitimate successor, the President of the Commonwealth, and not one convicted by a summary criminal court created by the  National Assembly of the  so-called Republic of the  Philippines, who violates a conditional pardon granted him by the President of the said Republic; and besides, the proceedings provided for the trial  of the offenses punishable under Act No. 65 and Ordinance No. 7 are repugnant to and derogatory of the constitutional rights of every accused under the Constitution of the Commonwealth; secondly, that the proceeding's had in said criminal case No. 3 of the said Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction are now void and without legal effect  in accordance with the proclamation of General Douglas  MacArthur; and  thirdly, that granting that the so-called Republic of the Philippines was a <em>de facto</em> government, the validity of its acts against the lawful government and its citizens  depended entirely upon its  ultimate success, and having been  overthrown by the forces  of liberation, all such  acts necessarily  perished with it.</p>
<p>The  City  Fiscal duly  appealed from said  resolution to this Court.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General,  in his brief for the appellant, upheld the  resolution of the lower court on the  ground that, although the so-called Republic of the Philippines was a <em>de facto</em> government and consequently its legislative and judicial acts are valid as a general rule,  as  an  exception to that rule, such acts as are hostile in their purpose and mode of enforcement to the authority of the national government, or impair the rights of the citizen under the constitution, are null and of no effect.  Therefore, the judicial act or punitive sentence imposed upon the appellee Benedicto Jose by the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction, under a  summary procedure which denies an accused  a fair hearing and deprives him of his  right to appeal, is null and void because said act impaired the rights of the citizen under the Commonwealth Constitution, and  was in  excess of the powers of the said <em>de facto</em> government.  As  a logical corollary, the conditional pardon granted to the appellee, which was a mere sequence of said proceedings, should also be deemed  null and ineffective.</p>
<p>The questions involved in this appeal are: (1) whether or not the sentence of ten years' imprisonment imposed upon the defendant by the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal   Jurisdiction  should  be  denied  validity  after the reoccupation of the Philippines and restoration of the Commonwealth  Government, and (2) whether the defendant can  now be prosecuted for having allegedly violated the conditional  pardon granted by  the President of the so-called Republic of the Philippines.</p><ol>
<li>As to  the first question, the alleged  crime of which the  defendant was prosecuted  and convicted  in  criminal case No. 3 of the Court of Special and Exclusive  Criminal Jurisdiction, according to the information above copied, was for a violation of sections 3 (b)  and 2 (b) of Act No. 65 of the National Assembly of the so-called  Republic of the Philippines, in connection with section 11 of Ordinance No. 1 of the President of the said  Republic.  Said section 11 of Ordinance No. 1 reads as follows:
  <p></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No one except the control organization or the persons designated by said organization shall engage in the purchase, importation, sale or transfer of rice and corn, or act as agent, broker, or intermediary in the purchase, sale or transfer of such commodities for the purpose of their sale or transfer unless authorized by the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 3(<em>b</em>) <em>and</em> 2(<em>b</em>) of Act No. 65 provide for the imposition in its  maximum  period of the penalty imposed by section 14 of said Ordinance No. 1 for the violation of the above-quoted  provisions  by private individuals. In accordance with our decision in the case of Co Kim Cham vs. Valdez  Tan Keh and  Dizon (G. R. No.  L-5, promulgated on September 17, 1945, p. 113, <em>ante</em>), judicial acts of the governments <em>de facto</em> established  by the  Japanese forces of occupation in these Islands  remained good and valid, except those which were of  a political complexion, upon  the restoration of  the Commonwealth  Government; and in the case of Peralta <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons (G. R. No. L-49, promulgated on November 12, 1945, p. 285, <em>ante</em>), we have  expounded  our opinion as well as the  opinion  of writers on International Law on the nature and description of a punitive sentence of a  political complexion.</p>
<p>Applying to the present case  what we have stated in the said decisions relating to penal sentences  of a political complexion, it  is evident that the punitive sentence which convicted the  appellee  to ten years' imprisonment, was of  a political  complexion and, therefore, it became of  no effect upon  the reoccupation of the Philippines and restoration of the Commonwealth Government,  because it  penalized as a crime an act "not criminal by the municipal law."  As Hall says,  upon the restoration of  the legitimate government in a territory which has been occupied by an enemy, by virtue of the right of <em>postliminium</em>, "<em>judicial</em> acts done under his control, when  they are not of a political  complexion,  *  *  *  remain good   *   *  *  Political acts on the other  hand fall through as of course  *  *  *  the execution also of punitive sentence ceases as of course when they have  had  reference to the acts not criminal by the municipal law of the state  *  *  *."   (International Law, seventh ed., p. 518.)</p></li><li>As to the  second question, we hold that  the appellee cannot now be prosecuted criminally for  a violation of the conditional pardon granted by the President of the so-called Republic of the Philippines, for the following reasons:
  <p></p></li></ol>
<p>Because, without necessity of discussing and determining the intrinsic validity of the conditional pardon, as an act done  by the President of  the  so-called  Republic of the Philippines,  after the restoration  of the Commonwealth Government, no elaborate argument is required  to  show that the effectivity of a conditional pardon depends on that of the sentence which inflicts upon a defendant the punishment  from, which the latter was exempted by the pardon. If a punitive sentence is or becomes null and void, the conditional pardon which remits the punishment inflicted by that sentence ceases to be of any effect in  so far as the individual upon whom it is bestowed is concerned, for the latter cannot be required  to serve, a void sentence of penalty imposed on him, even  without such pardon.</p>
<p>Besides,  under the  provisions of  Acts  Nos. 1524 and 1561,  which were the sources of article 159  of the Revised Penal Code, a violator of a conditional pardon was  liable to suffer or serve  the unexpired portion  of the original sentence, irrespective  of  the  length  of time of  said unexpired portion; and article 159 of the Revised Penal Code provides that if the penalty remitted by the granting of a pardon  be  higher than six  years, the convict shall  suffer the unexpired portion of his original sentence.  As the unexpired portion of the original punitive sentence imposed upon  the appellee is higher than six years  (inasmuch as he had served only about  six months of the ten years' imprisonment  imposed upon him),  if  the appellee be now prosecuted and convicted,  he shall have to be sentenced to serve  the unexpired portion of  his original sentence; but as the said  sentence is now invalid and of  no effect, it is obvious that the appellee  Benedicto Jose can no longer be prosecuted,  for no  penalty  can  be imposed upon  him for violation of said  conditional pardon.</p>
<p>In  order  to avoid confusion  and  error, it,may not be amiss to say that a conditional  pardon remits the punishment to be served by virtue of a sentence, and does not remit, terminate, or set aside the sentence itself.  Pardon is prospective, that is, remits only the penalty not yet suffered, and not retrospective or does not affect that which has already been served and much less the sentence.  (Robert <em>vs.</em> State, 51 N. Y. Supp., 691, 692; 30 App. Div., 106; <em>In  re</em> Spencer  [U.  S.],  22 Fed.  Cas.,  921,  923.)  The validity of a sentence is one thing, and the enforceability thereof another. A conditional pardon has the effect of suspending the  enforcement of a sentence, or exempting the culprit from serving the unexpired portion of the penalty,  if he does not  violate the conditions  under  which pardon was granted.  But the sentence  is still valid.  This is confirmed by  the second paragraph of article 36  of the Revised Penal Code  which provides that "a pardon shall in no case exempt the  culprit from the  payment of civil indemnities imposed upon him by the sentence."  The punitive sentence  had  not therefore, become null and void before the restoration of the Commonwealth Government by the pardon, but only upon the restoration of said government by  virtue of the right of <em>postliminium</em>, as above stated.</p>
<p>Violation  of  a conditional pardon  is not a  substantive offense or independent of the crime for the commission of which the punishment inflicted in the sentence was remitted by the pardon.  In the case of United States vs. Ignacio (35 Phil.,  202, 204), it was held that "the defendant accepted the conditional pardon and thereby  secured his release  from imprisonment.   Having accepted  the  conditional pardon, he is bound by its terms.   The record shows that he has been guilty  of misconduct after his conditional pardon.  By such misconduct, he forfeited his  pardon and his  right to liberty thereunder.  When  a pardoned person violates the conditions of his pardon, he is left in the exact situation in which he was when the pardon was granted, and <em>the original sentence may be enforced against him</em>. (<em>Ex parte</em> Wells, 18 Howard [U. S.], 307; <em>Ex parte</em> kins,  61 Ark., 321; 30 L.  R.  A.,  736; 54 Am. St. Rep, 209; Kennedy's Case 135 Mass., 48; <em>Ex parte</em> Marks, 64 Cal., 29.)"</p>
<p>Our holding that violation  of a conditional  pardon is not a substantive or independent offense, is in support of our conclusion that the invalidity of the original sentence upon  the restoration of the Commonwealth  Government carried with it the ineffectiveness of the conditional pardon, because "a conditional pardon  delivered and  accepted has1 been said to constitute a contract between the sovereign power or the executive and the  criminal that the  former will release the latter upon the compliance with the conditions."  (State <em>vs.</em> Eby, 170 Mo., 497; 71 S. W., 52; Peo. <em>vs.</em> Potter, 1 Edm. Sel. Cas. [N. Y.] 235; 1 Park Cr., 47; State <em>vs.</em> Smith, 17 S. C. L., 283; 19 Am. D., 679;  Lee <em>vs.</em> Murphy, 22 Gratt. [63 Va.], 789; 12 Am. R., 563; 46 C. J.; 1202.)  Consequently, if a  culprit violates the conditions1 of the contract of conditional  pardon,  this is resolved of set  aside, and the original punitive sentence,  which, has not been nullified  but only suspended in its  force  and  effect by such pardon,  shall have  to be enforced  against him.  But if the said sentence  is no longer good and valid and  cannot be  enforced,  the  defendant cannot be criminally prosecuted for the violation of the conditional pardon.                                                   :</p>
<p>For the foregoing reasons, the resolution appealed from is affirmed,  without costs.   So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Jamnilla, De Joya, Pablo</em>, and <em>Bengzon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"> <em>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>OZAETA,  J.,</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the result.  The  conditional pardon involved in this  case  had no legal  basis  because, for the reasons stated in my concurring opinion in the case of Peralta vs. Director of Prisons (G. R. No.  L-49, p. 306, <em>ante</em>) the  sentence in criminal case No. 3 of the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction, which said pardon purported to remit, was null and void.</p>
<p>I dissent from the <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the majority opinion because I  think  it is  untenable.   The  majority opinion holds that the sentence rendered against the herein appellee in said criminal case No.  3 of the Court of Special and Exclusive Criminal Jurisdiction was  valid but that, as it was of a political complexion, "it became  of no effect upon the reoccupation of the Philippines and restoration  of  the Commonwealth Government."  If  that sentence was valid and effective during the enemy occupation, then  the conditional pardon granted during the same  regime must, also be held valid; and  there was no necessity to declare that "it became of no effect upon the reoccupation of the Philippines" because the penalty imposed  by it  had already been remitted.  The effect of a sentence is, that the convict has  to suffer the  penalty  imposed.  Therefore, from  the moment  the penalty  is remitted by  pardon the  sentence ceases  to have further effect.</p>
<p>If the sentence  as  well as the conditional pardon were valid, it would be  immoral  and against public  policy to sanction or condone a  violation of any of its conditions.</p>
<p>The  majority opinion denies effectivity to the conditional pardon as a result  of its holding that the sentence it purported to remit became ineffective upon the restoration of the Commonwealth Government.  Such reasoning, I think, is unsound. The effectivity of a pardon  is not parallel to or coextensive with the effectivity  of the sentence to which it applies.  The former terminates the latter.  If we  assume, as  the majority  holds, that  the sentence was valid and effective during  the enemy occupation, we could  not escape the conclusion that the conditional pardon in question became effective at once upon its acceptance by  the prisoner as, in fact, he was released by  virtue of it; and after his release the sentence was no longer effective.   Thus the theory of the majority that "the punitive sentence which convicted the appellee to ten years' imprisonment  *  *  * became of no effect upon the reoccupation of the Philippines and restoration of the Commonwealth Government," falls of its own weight, because how could a sentence which had  been remitted and  had ceased to have any force and effect before the restoration of  the  Commonwealth  Government have been rendered ineffective upon such restoration?  That  would be tantamount to declaring that  a person who died in October, 1944 was  killed by a bomb which was dropped in February,  1945.</p>
<p>The weakness of the majority opinion becomes manifest when it  has to resort to Acts Nos. 1524 and 1561 as the sources of article 159 of the Revised Penal  Code, under which the accused has been prosecuted.  Those Acts  have fro application because the accused is  not prosecuted there-under but under the later and superseding penal statute, namely, article 159 of the Revised Penal Code; and under said article  the accused  could be  sentenced to suffer <em>prision correccional</em> in its minimum period if the conditional pardon were valid.  The fact that the second sentence of said article would have been applicable to the accused  were it not for the restoration of the Commonwealth Government and the right of <em>postliminium</em>, would not preclude the application of  the  first sentence  (which  provides  for the penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> in its minimum period) if the sentence against the accused were valid and  effective during the enemy occupation.  That is so because the pardon was granted on October 15, 1944, and the Restoration did not occur until February 27, 1945.  So that if the sentence as  well as the pardon  were valid during enemy  occupation, as the majority  opinion holds, it would result that the period from  October 15, 1944, to February 27, 1945, remained unserved but  remitted.  Hence the untenability of the majority's <em>ratio decidendi</em>.</p>
<p>The dictum of the majority that "violation of a conditional pardon is not a substantive offense or independent of the crime for the commission of which the punishment inflicted in the sentence  was remitted by the pardon, because the penalty imposed for such violation is the unexpired portion of the punishment imposed by the original sentence," is, I think, incorrect.  That may have been so before the enactment of article  159 of the Revised Penal Code;  but since that enactment it is a substantive offense because the penalty therefor is no longer necessarily the remitted portion of the sentence, for when  the unexpired portion is  less than six years the convict who violates the conditions of the pardon shall  suffer the  penalty  of  <em>prision correccional</em> in  its minimum period.</p>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>PARAS, J.,</strong></p>
<p>From the meager details appearing in the record we can deduce that the petitioner had been convicted of a violation of the Food Control Regulations, promulgated by the "President" of the "Republic of the Philippines."  Before the war, during the war and  until the present time, there have been such regulations  on  food control.  (<em>See</em> Commonwealth Act No. 600, enacted on August 17,1940; Executive Order No. 371, dated October 2, 1941; and Executive Order No. 62, dated August 14, 1945).   There is,  of course an honest conflict of opinion as  to the validity of the proceedings under which the  petitioner had been prosecuted and convicted; but I concur in the result for the  following reasons: The prosecution of  offenders at the outset  was a plausible attempt to curb food control violations during the emergency period.  Conditions,  however, had culminated to such a climax that  there  had been serious scarcity of food supplies and consequent starvation.  The instinct of self-preservation and necessity knew no law at  the time, so much so that further arrests  and prosecutions were not made in spite of rampant violation of the regulations.  Indeed, we may take judicial notice of the fact that even the authorities had then violated  said regulations by purchasing commodities over and above the ceiling prices fixed by them.   Under a  realistic  view  of these circumstances, I would consider the alleged conditional pardon granted to the petitioner as having become absolute and therefore beyond the purview of article 159 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p>We concur in the affirmance of appealed Judge Dizon's resolution.   The grounds alleged in said resolution are well-taken, and are in keeping with the legal propositions maintained  in our two opinions  in  the case of Co Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez Tan Ken and Dizon (G.

<p><strong>HILADO, J.,</strong></p>
<p>As in G. R. No. 49 (p.  355, <em>ante</em>),  "Peralta  <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons",  I concur in  the result, as well as in the reasons upon which the majority base their opinion not inconsistent with the views expressed in my dissenting opinion in G. R. No. L-5 (p.  199, <em>ante</em>),  and those set forth in my concurring opinion in "Peralta <em>vs. </em>Director of Prisons." But the importance of the principles involved would seem to  justify  more  elaboration  with a  view  to  further strengthening the grounds upon which  we order the defendant's release.</p>
<p>Besides the arguments  advanced in my dissenting opinion in "Co  Kim Cham <em>vs.</em> Valdez  Tan  Keh and Dizon"  and my concurring opinion in "Peralta <em>vs.</em> Director of Prisons," to show that the so-called Republic of  the Philippines was not even a <em>de facto</em> government within the meaning of International Law, there are three historical facts which, in my opinion,  would  conclusively prove that the said "Republic" was not such a <em>de facto</em> government.  Said facts are:  (1) the Pact of Alliance concluded  and signed by  and between the Imperial Government of Japan and the said "Republic" on October 14, 1943; (2) Proclamation No. 29 of the President of the "Republic of the Philippines", dated September 21, 1944, proclaiming martial law and placing "the Philippines and all parts  thereof"  thereunder for  the  alleged reason that "the danger of invasion" was "imminent"; and (3) Proclamation No. 30 of the same "President" proclaiming the existence of "a state  of war  *  *  * between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America and  Great  Britain, effective September 23, 1944, at 10 o'clock in the morning".   Because of their decisive bearing on the vital questions above referred  to, these  documents are hereinbelow transcribed  at length:</p>

  <p>"WHEREAS,  the Filipino people, during  the  whole period  of their subjection  to  alien rule,  have unremittingly labored for their freedom and independence and to this end fought two wars and countless revolutions;</p>
  <p>"WHEREAS, upon the attainment by the Philippines of this cherished goal of freedom and independence and on the occasion of the inauguration of the Republic of  the  Philippines on October 14,  1943, the President  appeal to  all nations  and  peoples of the world for  amity and goodwill and, to  the United States of America especially, pleaded that the Philippines he spared the suffering  and destruction incident to the resumption of military operations on our soil;</p>
  <p>"WHEREAS,  notwithstanding this  appeal,  the United  States  of America and Great Britain have attacked from the air certain parts of the  Philippines thereby violating- the  territorial integrity of the Republic, and causing death or injury to its citizens and destruction or damage to their property;</p>

  <p>"Face to face with the grim realities of war, I earnestly, call upon every Filipino at this momentous hour to show his unswerving loyalty and to give his support to the Government, so that,  regardless of the trials and tribulations we are undergoing and those we shall have to suffer in the near future, we may closely and  firmly  unite to safeguard the free and independent existence of the Philippines. </p>

<p>If the "Republic of the Philippines" had really been intended to be and to function as such a <em>de facto</em> government, certainly it would not have been in  a position to enter into any Pact of Alliance, nor to proclaim martial  law, nor to declare  war  or the  existence of a state of war—all of which are functions  appertaining solely to a <em>de jure</em> government otherwise empowered to perform them.  In that case, the only power which at the time could have declared martial  law would have been the Commander in Chief of the Imperial Japanese Forces stationed here.   And there would not have been even an occasion for  declaring a state of war since Japan had already declared war on the United States   and  Great  Britain therefore,  and  no  one would ever have thought of declaring a state of war to exist between such a<em> de facto</em> government  and the  United States and Great Britain—an  utter absurdity.  It clearly appears that Japan had so adulterated and corrupted the concept and  purpose  of a true <em>de facto</em> government as known in International Law (granting that this principle is  applicable to the instant case), that the resulting organization cannot find a proper  place in said law. It should be beyond cavil that the primary aim and purpose pursued by those who set  up that organization should determine  its true and real character.   If we find that their primary aim and  purpose  was to devise  an instrumentality  or agency<em> in aid</em> of Japan in her war against her enemies, particularly the United States, no incidental benefit or semblance  thereof, seemingly proceeding from the organization—be it in the form  of  judicial proceedings or otherwise—should be allowed to obscure our sight and becloud our judgment as to its essential reality.   If it was intended to  be and to serve as such instrumentality or  agency, it simply could not be a genuine <em>de facto</em> government.   The two concepts are so essentially different in nature and purpose that they cannot even  be blended  with each other,  as you cannot blend oil with water.  If we say that the "Republic  of the Philippines" was such instrumentality or agency, we cannot say that it was at the same time a <em>de facto</em> government within the meaning of International  Law.   And how can we escape calling it such instrumentality or agency  under the tragic facts of our recent past?</p>
<p>The notorious Pact of Alliance was concluded and signed on the <em>very  day</em> the "Republic of the Philippines" was inaugurated.  In it the "Republic" agreed with Japan to "closely cooperate on matters political,  economic, and military, for  the <em>successful prosecution of the War of Greater East  Asia</em>"  (Art.  II;  <em>italics</em> supplied).  The  unmistakable purpose to create such an instrumentality or agency is here betrayed by the <em>instant</em> harnessing of the "Republic" to Japan's war machine.  It was upon this pretext that <em>slave labor</em> was exacted  from  those thousands of Filipinos who were within the  effective  reach of  the invaders, for work on airfields and  other Japanese military installations, for service in the ill-named "Philippine Constabulary" and "Standing Army"; that direly needed food was taken from the mouths of our hungry children to feed the same Japanese  soldiers who were later  to murder them, etc.  Under Article III "The High Contracting Parties shall closely cooperate with each other for the establishment of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>As we have seen,  the proclamation of martial law took place on September  21, 1944, and the declaration of war on September  22, 1944.</p>
<p>That said proclamation of martial law was made<em> in aid</em> of Japan is patent from its very first paragraph wherein it was declared that "the danger of invasion being imminent and the public safety so requiring", martial law was therein proclaimed—the "invasion" alluded to being no other than the coming and landing  on  Philippine soil of the  American Forces of Liberation.</p>
<p>As to the declaration of war contained in the foregoing Proclamation No.  30,  of course, it was made <em>in aid</em> of Japan  in her  war  against the  United  States and Great Britain.</p>
<p>In the long history of the world, may I  ask, what <em>de facto</em> government has ever  played the role that the "Republic of the  Philippines" agreed to play, and did  play under the Pact of Alliance?</p>
<p>Things being thus, the fact that said  "Republic" had a "Constitution"  in whose  preamble "The Filipino people" proclaimed  "their independence,"  had  a  "President,"  a "Legislature,"  and a "Judiciary", far from proving that it was a <em>de facto</em> government, would conclusively  <em>disprove</em> it. For, in the first place, if it were a truly <em>independent</em> government, it would not be merely <em>de facto</em>, and secondly, if it was not, then it was a mere fraud and a  farce—the organization which has earned from President Roosevelt  no less a condemnation  than the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"I wish to make it clear that neither the former collaborationist 'Philippine Executive Commission' nor the present 'Philippine Republic' has the recognition or sympathy of the Government of the United States."  (Message of President Roosevelt, October  23, 1943, U. S. Naval War College, International Law Documents, 1943, pp. 93-94.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the handful  of Filipinos  who  organized  that "Republic" did so voluntarily,  their conduct would be hostile to the United States and their  own rightful Government, and, of course, no executive, legislative, or judicial act  of such  a  hostile  organization could  possibly  be valid  or binding  as against the rightful governments of the United States and the Commonwealth  of the Philippines, and their citizens.   If said Filipinos  acted under duress exerted by the Japanese  Imperial Forces,  then the whole fabric  of that "Republic" would be an utter nullity, and,  whatever coercive force and effect its acts might have  had <em>by sheer military compulsion</em> whilst the said invading  forces  remained  in this  country,  they  were clearly  devoid  of  intrinsic efficacy as against  said  rightful governments and their  citizens  after  the liberation.   Among  those citizens is the petitioner Benedicto  Jose y Santos.<br>
