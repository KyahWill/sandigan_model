<p>"11. That the attorney for the plaintiffs reserve the right to present a 
memorandum discussing the legal points of these agreement of facts within 3 days 
from date of the se agreement and the defendants counsel will answer the same 
within 3 days, after receipt of the plaintiff's memorandum."</p></blockquote>
<p>Judge Catalino Buenaventura gave judgment for plaintiffs without costs. This 
is an appeal from that judgment.</p>
<p>The gravamen of appellants' contention is good faith. They cite three 
decisions, one of which is Castillo vs. Valdez, 53 Phil. 120, wherein the Court 
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A purchaser for value, who takes property upon the faith of the 
certificate so issued, acquires a good title. Any other conclusion would be 
wholly inconsistent with the spirit and purposes of the Land Registration Law. 
Of course, so long as the property remains in the hands of the person who has 
acquired title irregularly, he can be made to surrender the certificate to be 
cancelled. But it is not so with an innocent purchaser for value * * *." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellants' citations do not fit into the facts of the present case. Good 
faith affords protection only to purchasers for value from the registered owner. 
Deogracias Evangelista, defendants' grantor, is not a registered owner. The land 
was and still is registered in the name of Casimiro Evangelista. In no way does 
the certificate of title state that Deogracias owned the land; consequently 
defendants can not summon, to their aid the theory of indefeasibility of Torrens 
title. There is nothing in the certificate and in the circumstances of the 
transaction which warrant them in supposing that they needed not looked beyond 
the title. If anything, it should have put them on their guard, cautioned them 
to ascertain and verify that the vendor was the only heir of his father, that 
there was no debt, and that the latter was the sole owner of the parcel.</p>
<p>If, as is probably the case, defendants relied on the court's order 
adjudicating to Deogracias Evangelista the entire estate in the distribution 
held under Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, their innocence avails them less as 
against the true owners of the land. That was a summary settlement made on the 
faith and strength of the distributee's self-serving affidavit; and Section lf 
of the above-mentioned rule provides that, "If it shall appear at anytime within 
two years after the settlement and distribution of an estate * * * that an heir 
or other person has been unduly deprived of his lawful participation in the 
estate, such heir or other person may compel the settlement of the estate in the 
court in the manner herein provided for the purpose of satisfying such 
participation." Far from shielding defendants against loss, the adjudication, 
and the rule under which it was made gave them a clear warning that they were 
acting at their peril. "A judicial partition in probate proceedings does not 
bind the heirs who were not parties thereto, lo partition, judicial or 
extrajudicial, could add one iota or particle to the interest which the 
partitioners had during the joint possession. Partition is of the nature of a 
conveyance of ownership, ana. certainly none of the co-owners may convey to the 
others more than his own true right. A judicial partition in probate proceedings 
is not final and conclusive, and not being of such definitive character as to 
stop all means of redress for a co-heir who has been deprived of his lawful 
share, such co-heir may still, within the prescriptive period, bring an action 
for <i>reivindicacion</i> in the province where any of the real property of the 
deceased may be situated. Broad perspectives of public policy are set out in the 
opinion of the Court in support of the wisdom of allowing a co-heir the benefits 
of the law of prescription even after a partition, judicial or extrajudicial, 
has been had." (Lajom vs. Viola, 73 Phil., 563.)</p>
<p>The judgment is affirmed with costs of this appeal against appellants.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones,
