				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 5,&nbsp; 1953, the&nbsp; City Fiscal filed in the Municipal&nbsp; Court, of Manila&nbsp; an information&nbsp; reading&nbsp; as follows:<br><br>"The undersigned accuses Bernardo Reyes and Mariano Beyes of the erime of&nbsp; coercion committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 26th&nbsp; dayf of August, 1953, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused,&nbsp; conspiring, confederating together&nbsp; and mutually' helping&nbsp; each other, through deceit&nbsp; and misrepresentation, did&nbsp; then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously seize, take and hold possession of passenger jeep bearing plate No. TPU-2695 belonging to Ag'ustin Blasco, without the knowledge and&nbsp; consent of the latter, for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; answering for the debt of the said&nbsp; owner, and despite repeated demands made upon them to return the&nbsp; said jeep, they refused and still refuse to do&nbsp; so, to the damage and prejudice of the said&nbsp; owner."<br></blockquote>Upon&nbsp; motion of the defendants, the court dismissed the information because&nbsp; it did pot allege the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of violence, notwithstanding the fact that the offense charged was coercion under Article 287 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code which provides, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; first paragraph, that&nbsp; "Any person&nbsp; who, by means of violence, shall seize&nbsp; anything belonging&nbsp; to his debtor,&nbsp; for the purpose of applying the same to the payment of the&nbsp; debt, shall suffer&nbsp; the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in its minirnum period and a fine "equivalent to the value of the thing, but&nbsp; in no case&nbsp; less than&nbsp; 75 pesos." An appeal to the Court of First Instance of Manila having been dismissed for lack of merit,&nbsp; the prosecution has elevated the case to us in third instance,&nbsp; contending that the offense charged is&nbsp; coercion or unjust vexation under the second, paragraph of Article 287 of the Revised Penal Code which provides that "Any other coercions or unjust vexations shall be punished by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto&nbsp; menor</span> or a fine ranging from 5 to 200 pesos, or both," under which violence is not, an&nbsp; essential element.<br><br>We&nbsp; agree&nbsp; with&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; Although the offense named in the information is coercion,&nbsp; it does not necessarily follow that the applicable provision is the first paragraph, since&nbsp; the&nbsp; second&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; also&nbsp; speaks&nbsp; of "coercions".&nbsp; Inasmuch as the recitals&nbsp; in&nbsp; the information do&nbsp; not include violence,&nbsp; the inevitable conclusion is that the coercion contemplated is that&nbsp; described and penalized in the second paragraph.&nbsp; The offense falling under the second paragraph&nbsp; cannot include&nbsp; violence as an element; otherwise it would come under the first paragraph.'<br><br>Another view we take of the case is that the information, though wrongly calling the offense&nbsp; charged as coercion,&nbsp; alleges&nbsp; facts sufficiently constituting&nbsp; unjust vexation, now mixed with coercion and also penalized under the second&nbsp; paragraph of&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 287.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the old. Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; other coercions&nbsp; and unjust&nbsp; vexations&nbsp; were considered misdemeanors against persons treated under a separate chapter., The principal feature of coercion under the first paragraph is&nbsp; that there be a taking by a person of his debtor's' property for the purpose of applying it to the payment&nbsp; of debt.&nbsp; This feature is recited&nbsp; in the information,&nbsp; consummated not by violence (distinguishing element specified in the&nbsp; first paragraph&nbsp; of Article 287), but thru deceit and misrepresentation no less effective than actual force in depriving the offended party of his free will. The decision in U. S.<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs. </span>Tupular, 7 Phil., 8, relied upon by the court of origin, is not controlling, because the offense involved therein was&nbsp; coercion defined&nbsp; in Article 498 of the old Penal Code which expressly called for violence, and which is the counterpart of the first paragraph of Article 287 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code.<br><br>The contention of defendant-appellees that the present appeal would place them in double jeopardy is unfounded. "Where the complaint or information is in truth valid and sufficient,, but the&nbsp; case&nbsp; is&nbsp; dismissed upon petition of the accused on&nbsp; the ground that the complaint or information is invalid and insufficient,&nbsp; such dismissal will not bar another prosecution for the same offense and&nbsp; the defendant is estopped from alleging&nbsp; in the&nbsp; second prosecution .that the former&nbsp; dismissal was wrong because the complaint or information was&nbsp; valid."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Morgan, Comments on the Rules of Court 52 ed., Vol. II, p. 802.)<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed order is reversed and the .case is ordered remanded to the Municipal Court of Manila for further proceedings.:&nbsp; So ordered, without costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista. Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
