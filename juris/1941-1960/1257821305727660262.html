				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintifffs-appellees instituted this action in the Court of First Instance 
of Quezon to recover title to a certain parcel of land in Unisan, Tayabas 
covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 4219 in the name of Juan Basco 
married to Rufilna Juadilla, dated December 19, 1936. By virtue of a deed of 
sale executed by Juan Basco in favor yof Modesto Alpay, said certificate of 
title was cancelled, and a transfer certificate of title issued in the name of 
the latter on August 5, 1943. The property was in turn sold by Modesto Alpay to 
defendant-appellant Tan Chuan Leong, a naturalized Filipino citizen on August 
30, 1943, as a result of which, sale, the transfer certificate of title in the 
name of Alpay was cancelled and another one issued in the name of Tan Chuan 
Leong. From the judgment declaring the property in question to be one of 
undivided ownership, belonging to the plaintiffs on one hand and the defendant 
Tan Chuan Leong on the other, in undivided equal shares, Tan Chuan Leong has 
prosecuted the appeal directly to Us. 
<p>The record discloses that original certificate of title in the name of Juan 
Basco married to Rufina Juadilla, was issued on December 10 1936, in lieu of 
Homestead Patent No. 40634; that plaintiff Severino Cañgas is the child of 
Rufina Juadilla by her first husband, while Adela Basco is her child by her 
second husband Juan Basco; that the property was acquired by Juan Basco during 
his marriage with Rufina Juadilla. In the amended complaint, it is alleged that 
the sale executed by Juan Basco in favor of Modesto Alpay affected only the 
undivided half belonging to Juan Based but not the other half pertaining to 
Rufina Juadilla or to her heirs, so that when Alpay executed a deed of sale in 
favor of defendant Tan Chuan Leong on August 30, 1943, Alpay transmitted to Tan 
Chuan Leong only the undivided half pertaining originally to Juan Basco. There 
is no allegation, in the complaint that defendant Tan Chuan Leong had knowledge, 
in fact, that Juan Basco owned only an undivided one-half of the property. But 
the court below, nevertheless, decided that Modesto Alpay and Tan Choan Leong 
may not be considered as purchasers in good faith because Juan Basco held the 
property merely as administrator and the purchasers should have known that the 
original certificate of title was in the name of Juan Basco married to Rufina 
Juadilla; that the purchasers were bound by the original certificate of title, 
insofar as it declares that the owner thereof is Juan Basco married to Rufina 
Juadilla.</p>
<p>Defendant Tan Chuan Leong in his answer alleges that he acquired the property 
by purchase from Modesto Alpay, in good faith and for valuable consideration, 
relying on the transfer certificate of the vendor, which did not contain any 
flaw or defect; that the person from whom he purchased the property also relied 
on the fact that the original certificate of title was in the name of Juan 
Basco, from which it was assumed that the phrase "married to Rufina Juadilla" 
was merely a description of the owner Juan Basco. The court states in its 
decision that Modesto Alpay testified ia court that he and Tan Chuan Leong were 
purchasers in good faith, he having been assured at the time of the sale that 
the land belonged exclusively to Juan Basco. Witness for the defendants also 
testified that he made inquiries before Tan Chuan Leong bought the property and 
tfiat he found that the title thereof was free from any encumbrance.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above declarations, however, the court declared that the 
defense of good faith cannot be sustained for the reason that the purchasers 
should have taken notice of the" fact that the original certificate of title 
states that Juan Basco was married to Rufina Juadilla.</p>
<p>The question before Us to decide, therefore, is whether or not the second 
purchaser, defendant-appellant Tan Chuan Leong, should have examined the 
original certificate of title from: which, he could have known that the property 
is held by the registered owner jointly with his wife Rufina Juadilla. We hold 
that the decision of the trial judge on this issue is incorrect. As we have 
already held, a person dealing with registered land is not required to go to the 
original registry to determine the condition of the property but is only charged 
with notice of the burdens on the property which are noted on the face of the 
register or the certificate of title.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whatever might have been generally or unqualifiedly stated in the case 
heretofore decided by this court, it is held that under the Torrens system 
registration is the operative act that gives validity to the transfer or creates 
a lien upon the land (Sees. 50 and 51,and Registration Act). A person dealing 
with registered land is required to go behind the register to determine the 
condition of the property. He is only charged with notice of the burdens on the 
party which are noted on the face of the register or the certificate of title. 
To require him to do more is to defeat one of the primary objects of the Torrens 
system. A bona fide purchaser for value of such property at an auction sale 
acquires good; title as against a prior transferee of the same property if such 
transfer was unrecorded at the time of the auction sale. The existence or 
absence of good faith will, of course, have to be determined upon the facts and 
the legal environment of each particular case." (Anderson &amp; Co., 
<em>vs</em>. Garcia, 64 Phil. 509) (See also Quimson <em>vs</em>. Suarez, 45 
Phil. 906-907; Reynes, et al., <em>vs</em>. Barrera, et al., 68 Phil. 656-657; 
Del Castillo, etc. <em>vs</em>. Sian et al., 105 Phil., 622; 56 Off. Gaz, [26] 
4328).</p></blockquote>
<p>In accordance with our recent decisions, in order that a purchaser may be 
considered as a purchaser in good faith, it is enough that he examines the 
latest certificate of title which, in this case, is that issued in the name of 
Modesto Alpay. (Hernandez <em>vs</em>. Vda. de Salas, 69 Phil. 774; Flores, et 
al. <em>vs</em>. Plasma, et al., 94 Phil., 327; 50 Qff. Qaz., [8] 1078; Revilla, 
et al., <em>vs</em>. Galindez, 107 Phil., 480). The purchaser is not bound by 
the original certificate of title but only by the certificate of title of the 
person from whom he purchased the property. </p>
<p>Good faith is presumed (Article 527, Civil Code). In the case at bar 
defendants-appellants specifically allege acquisition of the property in good 
faith. At the time of the trial witnesses testified for the defendants as to the 
absence of knowledge or notice that persons, other than the registered owner, 
are interested in the property.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances of the case, there being evidence that the 
defendant-appellant Tan Chuan Leong obtained the property in good faith, and 
none to the contrary, the court below should have found that defendant Tan Chuan 
Leong at least was a purchaser of the property in good faith and for value, and 
should have been protected from the claims of the heirs of the wife of the 
originally registered owner Juan Basco.</p>
<p>Wherefore, judgment is hereby rendered, reversing the decision appealed from 
and dismissing the complaint. Without costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p></div>
