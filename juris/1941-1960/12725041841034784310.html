				<H3>JOSE L. LAXAMANA, PETITIONER, VS. JOSE T. BALTAZAR, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When in July 1952 the mayor of Sexmoan, Pampanga, was 
suspended, the vice-mayor Jose T. Baltazar, assumed office as mayor by virtue of 
section 2195 of the Revised Administrative Code. However, the provincial 
governor, acting under section 21 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) of the Revised Election Code (R. A. 180), 
with the consent of the provincial board appointed Jose L. Laxamana, as mayor of 
Sexmoan, who immediately took the corresponding official oath. 
<p align="justify">Result: this <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> proceeding, based solely on the 
petitioner's proposition that the section first mentioned has been repealed by 
the subsequent provision of the Revised Election Code. </p>
<p align="justify">If there was such repeal, this petition should be granted, and 
Laxamana declared the lawful mayor of Sexmoan. Otherwise it must be denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">The two statutory provisions read as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 2195.—<span style="font-style: italic;">Temporary disability of mayor</span>.—Upon the occasion 
of the absence, suspension, or other temporary disability of the Mayor, his 
duties shall be discharged by the Vice-Mayor, or if there be no Vice-Mayor, by 
the councilor who at the last general election received the highest number of 
votes." </p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 21 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>). <span style="font-style: italic;">Vacancy in elective provincial, city or municipal 
office</span>.—Whenever a temporary vacancy in any elective local office occurs, the 
same shall be filled by appointment by the President if it is a provincial or 
city office, and by the provincial governor, with the consent of the 
provincial board, if it is a municipal office." (E. A. 180, the Revised Election 
Code.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">SEC. 21 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)—The portion relating to municipal offices was taken 
from section 2180 of the Revised Administrative Code, which partly provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 2180. <span style="font-style: italic;">Vacancies in municipal office</span>.—(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) In case of a 
temporary vacancy in any municipal office, the same shall be filled by 
appointment by the provincial governor, with the consent of the provincial 
board. </p>
<p align="justify">(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) In case of a permanent vacancy in any municipal office, the 
same shall be filled by appointment by the provincial board, except in case of a 
municipal president, in which the permanent vacancy shall be filled by the 
municipal vice-president" * * * </p></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">It will be seen that under this section, when the office of 
municipal president (now mayor) became <span style="font-style: italic;">permanently vacant</span> the vice-president 
stepped into the office. The section omitted reference to <span style="font-style: italic;">temporary vacancy</span> of 
such office because section 2195 governed that contingency. In this regard 
sections 2180 and 2195 supplemented each other. Paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) of section 2180 
applied to municipal offices in general, other than that of the municipal 
president.</p>
<p align="justify">Under the Revised Administrative Code,—specially the two 
sections indicated—there was no doubt in Government circles that when the 
municipal president was suspended from office, the vice-president took his 
place. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<span style="font-style: italic;">Temporary vacancy in office of municipal president</span>.—Paragraph 
(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) of this section (2180) should be construed to cover only municipal offices 
other than the office of president. Section 2195 of the Administrative Code 
should be applied in case of the absence, suspension, or other temporary 
disability of the municipal president. (Op. Atty. Gen., Sept. 21, 1917; Ins. 
And., Oct. 23, 1927.)" (Araneta, Administrative Code Vol. IV p. 2838)</p>
<p align="justify">"<span style="font-style: italic;">Municipal president cannot designate acting president</span>.—There 
is no provision of law expressly or implied authorizing the municipal president 
to designate any person to act in his stead during his temporary absence or 
disability. From the provision of section 2195 of 4his Code, it is clear that 
the vice-president or, if there be no vice-president, the councilor who at the 
last general election received the highest number of votes, should automatically 
(without any formal designation) discharge the duties of the president.'' (Op. 
Ins. Aud., March 2, 1926.) (Araneta, Administrative Code Vol. IV, p. 2839). 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Now, it is reasonable to assume that the. incorporation of the 
above section 2180 into the Revised Election Law as section 21 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) did not have 
the effect of enlarging its scope,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> to supersede or repeal section 2195, what 
with the presumption against implied repeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> "Where a statute has received a 
contemporaneous and practical interpretation and the statute as interpreted is 
reenacted, the practical interpretation is accorded greater weight than it 
ordinarily receives, and is regarded as presumptively the correct interpretation 
of the law. The rule here is based upon the theory that the legislature is 
acquainted with the contemporaneous interpretation of a statute, especially when 
made by an administrative body or executive officers charged with the duty of 
administering or enforcing the law, and therefore impliedly adopts the 
interpretation upon re-enactment." (Sutherland Statutory Construction, sec. 
5109.) </p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, even disregarding their origin, the allegedly 
conflicting sections, could be interpreted in the light of the principle of 
statutory construction that when a general and a particular provision are 
inconsistent the latter is paramount to the former (Sec. 288, Act 190). In other 
words, section 2195 referring particularly to vacancy in the office of mayor, 
must prevail over the general terms of section 21 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) as to vacancies of 
municipal (local) offices. Otherwise stated, section 2195 may be deemed an 
exception to or qualification of the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> "Where one statute deals with a 
subject in general terms, and another deals with a part of the same subject in a 
more detailed way, the two should be harmonized if possible; but if there is any 
conflict, the latter will prevail, regardless of whether it was passed prior to 
the general statute." (Sutherland Statutory Construction, sec. 5204.) </p>
<p align="justify">In a recent decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> we had occasion to pass on a similar 
situation—repeal by subsequent general provision of a prior special 
provision—and we said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is we!l settled that a special and local statute, providing 
for a particular case or class of cases, is not repealed by a subsequent 
statute, <span style="font-style: italic;">general in its terms, provisions and application</span>, unless the intent to 
repeal or alter is manifest, although the terms of the general act are broad 
enough to include the cases embraced in the special law. * * * It is a canon of 
statutory construction that a later <span style="font-style: italic;">statute, general in its terms</span> and not 
expressly repealing a <span style="font-style: italic;">prior special</span> statute, will ordinarily not affect the 
special provisions, of such earlier statute." (Steamboat Company vs. Collector, 
18 Wall. [U. S.], 478; Cass County vs. Gillett, 100 U. S. 585; Minnesota vs. 
Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373, 396.)</p>
<p align="justify">"Where there are two statutes, the earlier special and the 
later general—the terms of the general broad enough to include the matter 
provided for in the special—the fact that one is speeial and the other is 
general creates a presumption that the special is to be considered as remaining 
an exception to the general, one as a general law of the land, the other as the 
law of a particular case. (State vs. Stoll, 17 Wall. [U.S.], 425.)" 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In fact even after the Revised Election Code was enacted, the 
Department of the Interior and the office of Executive Secretary who are charged 
with the supervision of provincial and municipal governments have "consistently 
held that in case of the suspension or other temporary disability of the mayor, 
the vice-mayor shall, by operation of law, assume the office of the mayor, and 
if the vice-mayor is not available, the said office shall be discharge by the 
first councilor." (Annex 5 of the answer.) </p>
<p align="justify">Needless to say, the contemporaneous construction placed upon 
the statute by the executive officers charged with its execution deserves great 
weight in the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Consequently it is our ruling that when the mayor of a 
municipality is suspended, absent or temporarily unable, his duties should be 
discharged by the vice-mayor in accordance with sec. 2195 of the Revised 
Administrative Code. </p>
<p align="justify">This <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> petition is dismissed with costs. So ordered.
