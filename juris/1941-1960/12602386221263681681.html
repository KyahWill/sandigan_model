				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The spouses Domingo&nbsp; Geronimo&nbsp; and Olimpia Legaspi owned a&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; situated&nbsp; in the municipality of Rizal, province of&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, containing&nbsp; an area&nbsp; of&nbsp; a little&nbsp; more than two hectares, which&nbsp; they&nbsp; sold on&nbsp; April 11, 1936&nbsp; to&nbsp; the spouses&nbsp; Domingo&nbsp; Corpuz&nbsp; and Eugenia Regal, as&nbsp; a result of which&nbsp; transfer certificate&nbsp; of title No. 10229 was isued in their names.&nbsp; Domingo&nbsp; and Eugenia had a son named Isabelo Corpuz who was married to Susana Santiago Corpuz. On June 10, 1939, Eugenia thumb-marked a document acknowledging&nbsp; the receipt of P100 from&nbsp; Domingo Geronimo and Olimpia Legaspi&nbsp; and&nbsp; reciting that the latter&nbsp; could repurchase the&nbsp; land&nbsp; within&nbsp; four years, Domingo Corpuz&nbsp; not being able to&nbsp; sign the&nbsp; document because&nbsp; he was&nbsp; then in Manila&nbsp; for&nbsp; medical treatment, although Isabelo Corpuz&nbsp; was one of the witnesses thereto. Domingo Corpuz died on February 21,&nbsp; 1943.&nbsp; On March 1, 1946, Eugenia Regal thumb-marked another document, this time reselling and reconveying&nbsp; the land to Domingo Geronimo and&nbsp; Olimpia Legaspi&nbsp; for the sum of P550 one of the witnesses to the document being Isabelo's wife, Susana Santiago Corpuz.&nbsp; Eugenia Regal and Isabelo Corpuz&nbsp; died successively, the first&nbsp; on&nbsp; July 6, 1946, and the&nbsp; second soon afterwards.&nbsp; On August&nbsp; 14,1947, Susana Santiago Corpuz, in her capacity as&nbsp; guardian of Renato, Vicente and Erlinda Corpuz her&nbsp; minor&nbsp; children&nbsp; with the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; Isabelo Corpuz), executed an extra-judicial partition of the estate that passed to them&nbsp; from their deceased father (Isabelo Corpuz)&nbsp; and deceased grandparents (Domingo Corpuz and' Eugenia Regal),&nbsp; among which was the land covered by transfer certificate of title No.&nbsp; 10229.&nbsp; By virtue of such partition, transfer certificate of&nbsp; title No. T-1995 was issued in the name of said minors on August 16, 1947.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch as Domingo Geronimo, who&nbsp; was then in possession of the land,&nbsp; had&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to part&nbsp; with&nbsp; said&nbsp; possession,&nbsp; Susana Santiago Corpuz, in her&nbsp; capacity as guardian of the&nbsp; persons and properties&nbsp; of&nbsp; the minors&nbsp; Renato,&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; and Erlinda,&nbsp; she was&nbsp; appointed as such in&nbsp; special&nbsp; proceedings No.&nbsp; 206, filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Nueva Ecija a complaint against Domingo Geronimo, praying that the latter&nbsp; be&nbsp; ordered to vacate the land and to&nbsp; pay to Susana an amount equivalent&nbsp; to 180 cavanes&nbsp; of&nbsp; palay, plus the sum&nbsp; of P500 as damages.<br><br>The defense set up&nbsp; by the defendant in his answer&nbsp; was that the transaction between the spouses Domingo&nbsp; Geronimo and&nbsp; Olimpia Legaspi and the&nbsp; spouses Domingo&nbsp; Corpuz and Eugenia Regal which took&nbsp; place in 1936 was a <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>&nbsp; sale&nbsp; and&nbsp; that, as a matter of fact, Eugenia Regal resold the&nbsp; land to the defendant&nbsp; in 1946, in conformity with a previous agreement.&nbsp; After trial, the court rendered a decision dismissing the complaint and holding that the defendant and his wife are the true and legal owners of the land described&nbsp; and covered by transfer&nbsp; certificate of title No. T-1995.&nbsp; Prom this decision the plaintiff appealed.<br><br>The trial court found that there is&nbsp; no proof to show that the transaction in&nbsp; 1986&nbsp; was&nbsp; a <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>&nbsp; sale, although it ruled&nbsp; that&nbsp; under&nbsp; the evidence defendant's theory that the land was resold to him and his wife should be sustained.&nbsp; Reliance lias been placed on the two documents thumbmarked by&nbsp; Eugenia Regal, the&nbsp; first "on&nbsp; June 10,&nbsp; 1989 and&nbsp; the second on March 1,&nbsp; 1946, and&nbsp; on the fact that the first was witnessed by Isabelo Corpuz&nbsp; (plaintiff's&nbsp; husband&nbsp; and son&nbsp; of the&nbsp; spouses Domingo&nbsp; Corpuz and Eugenia Regal), and the second was witnessed by the plaintiff herself.&nbsp; The trial court moreover held&nbsp; that Eugenia Regal must be&nbsp; considered as having&nbsp; acted&nbsp; as the legal&nbsp; representative of&nbsp; her deceased&nbsp; husband&nbsp; Domingo Corpuz in the matter of the reconveyance which she executed in 1946 in favor of the spouses Domingo Geronimo and Olimpia Legaspi;&nbsp; and that the plaintiff, by acting&nbsp; as&nbsp; a witness to the&nbsp; document of resale,&nbsp; must be&nbsp; considered as having participated there on behalf of her minor children. There can be no dispute that the land in question, after its&nbsp; purchase from the&nbsp; spouses Domingo Geronimo&nbsp; and Olimpia&nbsp; Legaspi,&nbsp; became&nbsp; the&nbsp; conjugal property&nbsp; of the spouses Domingo Corpus and Eugenia Regal&nbsp; (Article 1401, old Civil&nbsp; Code), and&nbsp; that upon the death&nbsp; of&nbsp; Domingo, the conjugal&nbsp; partnership&nbsp; was&nbsp; dissolved&nbsp; (Article 1417, old Civil Code), one undivided half becoming the property of Eugenia (Article 1392, old Civil Code), and the other undivided half (which pertained to the deceased&nbsp; Domingo Corpus) passing to the latter's heir, Isabelo Corpus.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Suiliong &amp; Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Chio-Taysan, 12 Phil., 13, C. J. Arellano in Bondad <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Bondad, 34 Phil.,&nbsp; 232.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Without judicial appointment Eugenia Regal could certainly not&nbsp; be considered as the administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband Domingo Corpus, and it was not enough to assume that, under the law,&nbsp; she would eventually have been appointed as such.&nbsp; Neither was&nbsp; it sufficient to&nbsp; suppose that the reconveyance by&nbsp; Eugenia Regal in&nbsp; 1946 was .merely in virtue of the previous agreement&nbsp; to resell, "first because said agreement was&nbsp; evidenced by&nbsp; a&nbsp; document thumb-marked&nbsp; by Eugenia&nbsp; on June 10,&nbsp; 1939,&nbsp; without&nbsp; any, participation on the part of her husband Domingo Corpus who was then alive, and secondly because the reconveyance executed on March&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1946 was&nbsp; beyond the stipulated period of four&nbsp; years,&nbsp; and there was&nbsp; no finding that any valid extension was ever&nbsp; granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that Isabelo Corpus,&nbsp; deceased husband of the plaintiff and father of the minors Renato, Vicente and Erlinda,' was one of the witnesses of the document of June 10, 1939, cannot have any effect on Isabelo&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the land&nbsp; in question, because Domingo Corpus was then alive and said land was still the latter's property.&nbsp; Much less could&nbsp; the face that the plaintiff acted as a witness&nbsp; to the&nbsp; document of reconveyance thumb-marked by Eugenia Regal on March 1, 1946, bind the minors Renato, Vicente and Erlinda, because&nbsp; Eugenia in the first place had no authority to sell the undivided half of.&nbsp; the conjugal property pertaining to her deceased husband and passing&nbsp; after the latter's&nbsp; death&nbsp; to his heir, Isabelo&nbsp; Corpus.&nbsp; "A&nbsp; sale&nbsp; by a woman of property&nbsp; which pertained to the conjugal partnership of herself&nbsp; and her. deceased spouse, who is survived by legitimate children, is void as the half pertaining to the&nbsp; husband passed&nbsp; by operation of law&nbsp; to the said children upon the husband's demise."&nbsp; (Talag <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Langkengko,&nbsp; et al., No. L-4623, October 24, 1952.)&nbsp; In the second place, even assuming that, by acting as a witness, the plaintiff was estopped, her act could&nbsp; not legally&nbsp; prejudice her minor children, inasmuch as on the date of the.transaction, March 1, 1946,&nbsp; she was not yet&nbsp; the legal guardian of her children's property; and even as&nbsp; natural guardian she was prohibited from selling, ceding or compromising&nbsp; her wards' interest or property without judicial authority.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 169, old&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code; Palanca <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Baguisi, 38 Phil., 172).<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed decision is&nbsp; reversed; the minors Renato, Vicente and&nbsp; Erlinda, all surnamed&nbsp; Corpus,&nbsp; represented herein by the plaintiff-appellant, .are declared owners of an&nbsp; undivided one&nbsp; half of the land covered&nbsp; by transfer certificate of title No. T-1995, the other undivided one half belonging to the&nbsp; defendant-appellee;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; is ordered to&nbsp; return to the&nbsp; defendant-appellee the sum of&nbsp; P275 representing one half of the repurchase price paid by the&nbsp; latter to&nbsp; Eugenia&nbsp; Regal.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered, without costs. &nbsp;<br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bantista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.
