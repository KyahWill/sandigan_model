				<H3>RAYMUNDO  TRANSPORTATION  CO.,  INC.,  PETITIONER TEOFILO CERDA, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Teofilo  Cerda is a holder of a certificate of public convenience granted him  by the Public Service Commission to operate a  bus service for the transportation of passengers and  freight on the line Binangonan (Rizal) to Manila and vice versa.  This certificate  is but a  conversion into a permanent one  of the emergency certificate previously given him by the Commission way back in 1947. On September 12, 1953, he asked for authority to increase his present number of trips  by eight additional  round trips with the use of three additional buses on the ground that public convenience required the operation  of the additional trips.  His application was opposed by Raymundo Transportation Co., A.  Gergaray Tanchingco and the  Hatill Transit alleging that the services they are rendering on the same  line are more than sufficient to  satisfy the needs of the  traveling public, and hence  there  is no need for the additional trips on the same line.</p>
<p>At the  hearing, the  applicant presented the testimony of Sisenando Sison, Pedro Fineza, and Fernando Flores, all residents  of Binangonan, Rizal,  while on the  part of the oppositors, only the first two submitted evidence in support of their opposition, and on the strength of the evidence submitted, tjte Commission found that the preponderance of evidence "justifies the authorization  of additional trips on the line although not in the number asked by the applicant" and granted him authority to operate only four additional round trips with one auto-truck subject to certain specified conditions. From  this  decision,   oppositor  Raymundo Transportation Co.  interposed the  present petition  for review.</p>
<p> It is contended for petitioner that  the  decision  of the Public  Service Commission is erroneous because (1) there is no need for the service applied for because the present service rendered by petitioner and other operators is more than enough  to satisfy  the needs of the traveling public; (2) the four  additional  round trips granted to responden Would  result  in ruinous competition with the  service of petitioner; and  (3)  if  there  is any need for  additional service, petitioner should be given the preference of rendering it  being  an old operator.</p>
<p>With regard to the first point, the evidence submitted by applicant and the oppositor is  conflicting. Yet the Commission  took  pains  in  weighing the credibility  of the' witnesses and found that the preponderance was in favor of the applicant.   Thus,  the Commission found that ."there are hours of the day when the means of transportation are not sufficient because of the volume of  traffic at such hours which can be remedied  by authorizing a few additional trips to take care of the needs of the public.  The  reports of the checking made at Taytay of the buses passing  by that place and the number [of passengers carried by each bus indicate that there is a reasonable number of passengers carried throughout  the day but that at certain hours passengers traffic is much heavier."   This raiding  is supported by sufficient evidence, and following the well-known precedent that when the decision  of  the, Public Service Commission is supported by some evidence, the same should be left undisturbed, it can  readily be seen  that the first point taken by petitioner cannot be entertained.</p>
<p>The contention  that the additional  service might spell ruin to the business of  petitioner  has also no basis for the evidence shows that  the traffic on  the line applied for is of such a volume that warrants the  granting  of the additional trips.   Moreover,  there is  enough evidence  to show that if petitioner had suffered some losses they are due  not  to  competition  but to bad  roads  and to  poor management of the business.  The claim that respondent should not be allowed to undertake additional trips because he does not  have the financial means to do so has also  no merit  for the  Commission  has found that he has such means and  as a  matter  of  fact he  had already acquired one  reserved unit  at  the  time he  filed  the present application.</p>
<p>As to the claim that petitioner shoulcl be given the privilege  of rendering the additional  service because  it  .is an old operator, suffice |t to say that this rule only  applies when the old operator offers to meet  the increase in the demand the moment it arises and not  after another operator had offered  to render  the additional service as was done in the present case (Angat-Manila Trans. Co., Inc. <em>vs. </em>Victoria Vda. de  Tengeo, 95  Phil.,  58).  The  rule protects those who are vigilant  in  meeting the needs of the traveling public.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em>  concur.</p>
<p><em>Montemayor, J., </em>concurs in the result.<br>
