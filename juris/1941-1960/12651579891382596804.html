				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Jose Go was charged with attempted homicide in criminal Case&nbsp; No. 4359 and&nbsp; frustrated homicide&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal case No.&nbsp; 4360&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Rizal, Quezon City&nbsp; Branch.&nbsp; To secure&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant's provisional&nbsp; release from custody, the Alto Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. filed a bail bond in the amount of P4,000 in the first and P5,000 in the second case.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp; day set for trial of the two cases (14 May 1956) the defendant failed to appear despite&nbsp; previous notice.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; motion of the Fiscal,&nbsp; the Court entered an order&nbsp; forfeiting&nbsp; the two bonds;&nbsp; granting the&nbsp; surety company thirty&nbsp; days within which to produce&nbsp; the person of the defendant in Court and&nbsp; to explain&nbsp; why judgment should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be rendered against it on the bonds;&nbsp; and ordering the arrest of the defendant.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 22&nbsp; May the surety company received a copy of the foregoing order.&nbsp; On 24 May the surety company moved to have the order set aside, on the ground that on 14 May 1956, the date set for the trial of the&nbsp; defendant,&nbsp; the brother of&nbsp; the latter went&nbsp; to&nbsp; Court&nbsp; to&nbsp; inform it&nbsp; that&nbsp; his brother was confined in the National&nbsp; Mental Hospital since&nbsp; 10 May&nbsp; 1956, and for that&nbsp; reason&nbsp; he failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear in&nbsp; Court on that date, but that the defendant's brother arrived a few minutes after the cases had&nbsp; been called and the&nbsp; order forfeiting the&nbsp; bonds entered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attached to&nbsp; the motion is a certificate issued by the&nbsp; Chief,&nbsp; National&nbsp; Mental&nbsp; Hospital,&nbsp; attesting&nbsp; to the fact&nbsp; that Jose Go was confined in the&nbsp; hospital since 10 May 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 4 June the Court denied the motion. On 14 June the surety company received a copy of the&nbsp; order denying its motion.&nbsp; On 12 July the surety company filed a motion for reconsideration of the orders of 14 May and 4&nbsp; June. On 14 July&nbsp; the Court denied the motion for reconsideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; two&nbsp; orders&nbsp; just mentioned and ordered the&nbsp; forfeiture&nbsp; in favor of the Government of the two&nbsp; bonds, on the ground that it&nbsp; had failed to produce the person&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; within thirty&nbsp; days&nbsp; from receipt&nbsp; of notice and to give satisfactory explanation of the defendant's failure to appear on the day of the trial.<br><br>On 18 July the surety company moved for the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the defendant.&nbsp; On 19 July the surety company received a copy of the order&nbsp; dated 14 July. On 6 August it filed a motion dated 3&nbsp; August praying that the order of 14 July be reconsidered and the forfeiture of the&nbsp; bonds set aside.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 21 August the Court denied the motion.&nbsp; On 25 August the surety company received a&nbsp; copy of the&nbsp; order denying&nbsp; its&nbsp; motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; On 28 August the surety company filed a&nbsp; notice&nbsp; appealing from the&nbsp; orders of 14&nbsp; May, 4 June, 14 July and 21 August 1956.<br><br>On&nbsp; 4 February 1957,&nbsp; after the&nbsp; appellant had filed its brief in this&nbsp; Court, the appellee moved for the dismissal of the appeal on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that the appellant's notice of appeal and brief were filed out of time.<br><br>The&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; objected&nbsp; to the&nbsp; motion.&nbsp; The appellee replied to the objection.<br><br>On the motion to dismiss the appeal this Court resolved to defer action until the case be considered on the merits.<br><br>The appellee claims that the appellant's appeal&nbsp; should have been perfected within 15 days from receipt of notice of judgment, as provided for in section 6, Rule 118, and its&nbsp; brief should&nbsp; have&nbsp; been filed&nbsp; within 30&nbsp; days&nbsp; from receipt of notice&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; record of&nbsp; appeal was received by the appellate&nbsp; court pursuant to section 3, Rule&nbsp; 120; whereas the appellant contends that&nbsp; its&nbsp; appeal was&nbsp; perfected on time within 30 days from receipt of notice of judgment as&nbsp; provided for&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 3, Rule&nbsp; 41, and its brief was filed within 45 days from receipt of five copies of its printed record on appeal pursuant to section 12, Rule 48, and the notice sent to&nbsp; it by&nbsp; the Clerk of&nbsp; this Court.<br><br>From 19&nbsp; July,&nbsp; the&nbsp; date&nbsp; the appellant received&nbsp; a copy of the order&nbsp; forfeiting in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; Government the two&nbsp; bonds it had filed for the provisional release of the defendant, to 6&nbsp; August, the date&nbsp; it&nbsp; filed its&nbsp; motion for reconsideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; order of forfeiture, a period of 18 days elapsed.&nbsp;&nbsp; From 25 August, the date the appellant received a copy of the order denying its motion for reconsideration to 28&nbsp; August, the date it&nbsp; filed&nbsp; its&nbsp; notice of appeal, 3 days elapsed.&nbsp; The appeal was perfected 21 days after receipt&nbsp; of&nbsp; a copy of the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of forfeiture.&nbsp; The appellee claims that&nbsp; the&nbsp; notice of appeal&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed on 30 and not&nbsp; 28 August, and that the appeal was perfected 23 days after receipt of a copy of the order of forfeiture.<br><br>In People <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Lorredo,&nbsp; 50 Phil., 209, this Court said:<br><blockquote>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the uncertainty as to the period within which an appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; an order directing the execution of the order of forfeiture of&nbsp; a bail&nbsp; bond&nbsp; may be perfected, after&nbsp; the entry of said order of forfeiture&nbsp; and the&nbsp; expiration of the thirty&nbsp; days granted to&nbsp; the sureties within which to present the body of the accused and&nbsp; to&nbsp; show cause&nbsp; why&nbsp; the judgment of forfeiture of said bond should not be executed.&nbsp; without&nbsp; having&nbsp; done either one or&nbsp; the other, or in case they did so, the explanation given not having been satisfactory,&nbsp; appeals taken&nbsp; out of the time required for perfecting an appeal&nbsp; in criminal, as well as in civil, cases have&nbsp; been brought to this court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>The American doctrines on&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject are not uniform.â€”there are&nbsp; some,&nbsp; and&nbsp; which constituted&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority,&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the proceeding for the execution of an&nbsp; order of&nbsp; forfeiture of a bail bond is civil in&nbsp; nature, and there are others holding that&nbsp; the same is of a criminal character, and that the appeal&nbsp; must be perfected in accordance&nbsp; with the law of&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; relating&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Subject.&nbsp; (6 C.
