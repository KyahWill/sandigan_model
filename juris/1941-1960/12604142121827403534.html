				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petition to&nbsp; review the decision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Public Service Commission denying petitioner's application in&nbsp; PSC Case No.&nbsp; 88055 for&nbsp; an increase of trips&nbsp; and equipment on the Biñan-Manila&nbsp; and Manila-Batangas Lines.<br><br>Petitioner, a TPU&nbsp; auto-truck operator on the lines above referred to, filed&nbsp; with the Public Service Commission an application, dated June 2,&nbsp; 1956, for&nbsp; an&nbsp; increase of equipment and additional trips&nbsp; on said&nbsp; lines.&nbsp; Her application was duly opposed by the Biñan Transportation Co., the Batangas&nbsp; Transportation Co. and the Laguna-Tayabas Bus Co., on the&nbsp; ground,<span style="font-style: italic;"> inter alia,</span> that service on the lines subject of the&nbsp; application was more than sufficient to take care&nbsp; of&nbsp; the volume&nbsp; of&nbsp; traffic; that&nbsp; oppositors&nbsp; are ready and willing to&nbsp; meet and provide for any emergency service that might&nbsp; arise from time to time; and that the authorization&nbsp; of the&nbsp; additional service applied for by&nbsp; petitioner would only&nbsp; result in&nbsp; useless duplication of service and promote ruinous competition between petitioner and TPU operators already authorized&nbsp; on&nbsp; said lines.<br><br>Having presented her&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; prayed for the issuance of a provisional permit authorizing&nbsp; her&nbsp; to operate the line applied for with the use of the proposed additional equipment, consisting of&nbsp; four (4) auto-trucks. On the ground that there&nbsp; is&nbsp; "no&nbsp; immediate and urgent public necessity&nbsp; for the operation of the proposed additional&nbsp; services,"&nbsp; the Commission denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; same in&nbsp; an order, dated&nbsp; July 10, 1956.&nbsp; (Record, p. 48).<br><br>After trial,&nbsp; the Commission, not&nbsp; being&nbsp; satisfied from the evidence presented of the necessity for additional service on&nbsp; the lines in question,&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; a decision, dated October 18, 1956, denying the application.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; November&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; having&nbsp; been denied by&nbsp; the Commission in an order dated December 14, 1954, (Record,&nbsp; p. 108) the applicant interposed the present petition to review the decision of the Commission.<br><br>Four errors are assigned by appellant, all of which boil down to one single factual&nbsp; issue, i.e., whether&nbsp; or not there is necessity for the&nbsp; additional&nbsp; service applied&nbsp; for by petitioner-appellant.<br><br>It is argued for&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Commission gave undue&nbsp; credit to the reports&nbsp; of its agents assigned&nbsp; to check on the volume of passenger traffic on the lines involved in her application.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; considering the evidence, the Commission ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>"Although evidence has been presented by the applicant on rebuttal tending to&nbsp; show&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; entries&nbsp; regarding the number of&nbsp; trips recorded by agents&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission in their checkbooks do not reflect the&nbsp; correct number&nbsp; of&nbsp; passengers,&nbsp; we are not inclined to Rive credence to the testimony of the conductors of&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicant, considering&nbsp; that they are her own employees&nbsp; and the&nbsp; agents&nbsp; involved have&nbsp; testified on surrebuttal that the conductors of the applicant, including those of other operators like the Laguna Transportation, always make it&nbsp; a point of check the entries made&nbsp; by them to verify whether the agents record the correct number of passengers&nbsp; in&nbsp; their checkers books.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; if it&nbsp; is&nbsp; really true that&nbsp; some&nbsp; agents of the Commission do not&nbsp; indicate&nbsp; the&nbsp; correct number of&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; in their&nbsp; checkers&nbsp; reports, they should&nbsp; have brought the&nbsp; matter immediately&nbsp; to the attention of&nbsp; the Commission, but the applicant or her employees have not taken&nbsp; any steps either during the&nbsp; course of the checking itself or&nbsp; immediately thereafter in order to&nbsp; bring to our attention&nbsp; this alleged discrepancy in the number of&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; recorded by&nbsp; the&nbsp; agents&nbsp; in their&nbsp; checker's reports.&nbsp; Unless clear and positive proof is presented that the agents of the Commission do not enter in their checker's reports the correct number of&nbsp; passengers, we&nbsp; can not&nbsp; simply&nbsp; disregard&nbsp; the&nbsp; entries made by&nbsp; these&nbsp; agents in their checker's&nbsp; reports."&nbsp; (Petitioner's Brief,&nbsp; pp,&nbsp; 44-45.)<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; effect, appellant would want us&nbsp; to&nbsp; substitute the agents' reports with the&nbsp; testimony of her passenger witnesses, which we can not do inasmuch as there is a complete absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; any positive evidence&nbsp; that&nbsp; such agents are biased or otherwise prejudiced.<br><blockquote>"We&nbsp; have held that the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; one or two passenger witnesses, such as those produced for the appellants, is relatively unreliable as&nbsp; against the Commission's checkers,&nbsp; first, because such witnesses are not entirely free from&nbsp; bias, and second, because they do not make their observations of the&nbsp; volume&nbsp; of traffic during a certain fixed period so as to get the&nbsp; average, but at some&nbsp; hours of the&nbsp; day when they actually board a bus and&nbsp; find&nbsp; it to be either crowded or&nbsp; empty, whether or not&nbsp; the day&nbsp; is&nbsp; a week day or a holiday, or the&nbsp;&nbsp; hour&nbsp; is&nbsp; one when the&nbsp; traffic is heavy or light." (Guico <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Bachrach&nbsp; Motor&nbsp; Co., et al.,&nbsp; L-9570, July 29, 1957.)<br></blockquote>Even&nbsp; if it were&nbsp; true,&nbsp; as petitioner claims, that&nbsp; certain prospective passengers&nbsp;&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp; accommodated&nbsp; in&nbsp; her vehicles at certain hours&nbsp; of the day, that circumstance does not&nbsp; militate against&nbsp; the Commission's&nbsp; holding that&nbsp; the additional&nbsp; service&nbsp; applied&nbsp; for is not&nbsp; necessary.<br><blockquote>"The fact that a prospective passenger on a transportation line, on a&nbsp; certain day and hour, fails to secure transportation, either because at&nbsp; the moment there was no bus passing, or if there were it was already&nbsp; full,&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be a valid&nbsp; test of&nbsp; whether additional service on&nbsp; the&nbsp; line&nbsp; is needed.&nbsp; A person&nbsp; desiring&nbsp; transportation cannot expect, and has no right to expect,&nbsp; available transportation every minute of the day for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason that transportation companies are not&nbsp; required. and&nbsp; are in no position to furnish&nbsp; said transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; is&nbsp; the reason&nbsp; why said&nbsp; companies,&nbsp; including railroad and shipping companies, have time schedules.&nbsp; A traveller has to&nbsp; adjust himself to said schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be that occasionally a bus on which a traveller desires to secure transportation is already filled, thereby requiring&nbsp; him to wait for the&nbsp; next bus:&nbsp; but these may "be ordinary and&nbsp; inevitable incidents in the&nbsp; transportation system over which&nbsp; common&nbsp; carriers have&nbsp; no control.&nbsp; Time&nbsp; schedules and frequency of trips are&nbsp; based&nbsp; and&nbsp; adjusted&nbsp; by said companies and approved by the Commission on the&nbsp; basis of&nbsp; ordinary and usual traffic and not on occasional&nbsp; and unexpected congestion of traffic when, for instance, whole&nbsp; families go visiting relatives in&nbsp; another town, or attend a town fiesta, or parties to a case bring witnesses to&nbsp; court for trial, etc."&nbsp; (Laguna Tayabas&nbsp; Bus Co.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Regodon, 100 Phil., 570; 53 Off. Gaz., [4], 1046.)<br></blockquote>Petitioner is&nbsp; impugning the findings of fact of the Commission, without alleging&nbsp; or&nbsp; showing that there is&nbsp; an absence of evidence to support them.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp; well&nbsp; settled rule that the Commission's findings as to facts&nbsp; are binding and conclusive upon us&nbsp; as long as they are reasonably supported by&nbsp; substantial evidence, which is the case here (Estate of Buan <i>vs.</i> Pampanga Bus Co.,&nbsp; 99&nbsp; Phil., 373;&nbsp; Medina <i>vs.</i> Saulog&nbsp; Transit, Lr-7244, June 28, 1956; Red&nbsp; Line Trans. Co.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Taruc,&nbsp; L-6179, November&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1954;&nbsp; Pangasinanf Trans. Co. <i>vs.</i> Tambo, 95 Phil., 661; Angat-Manila&nbsp; Trans. Co. <i>vs.</i> Vda. de Tengco, 95 Phil., 58; Interprovincial Autobus <i>vs.</i> Mabanag; 88&nbsp; Phil., 66; Manila Yellow&nbsp; Taxicab vs. Danon, 58 Phil., 75). As a matter of fact, we are not even required to&nbsp; examine the conflicting evidence to determine whether or not the preponderance of evidence&nbsp; really justifies the&nbsp; Commissions's findings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; well settled&nbsp; rule&nbsp; is that&nbsp; we can not substitute&nbsp; our discretion for that of the Commission&nbsp; on factual questions unless it clearly&nbsp; appear that there is no evidence to support the&nbsp; contested&nbsp; finding (Guico <i>vs.</i> Bachrach Motor&nbsp; Co., <i>supra</i>.)<br><blockquote>"These findings of fact are&nbsp; conclusive upon this Court,&nbsp; which cannot weigh&nbsp; the conflicting evidence&nbsp; and substitute its own conclusions in lieu&nbsp; of those&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commission, and&nbsp; can&nbsp; not modify or set&nbsp; aside the latter except when it clearly appears that there was&nbsp; no&nbsp; competent evidence before&nbsp; it to support reasonably its decision.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case&nbsp; at bar, petitioner does not claim that such evidence&nbsp; is&nbsp; lacking.&nbsp; He merely questions&nbsp; the&nbsp; weight or sufficiency thereof."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Espiritu <i>vs.</i> Los Baños, L-7121, July 30,&nbsp; 1955.)<br><br>"In the&nbsp; final analysis,&nbsp; the determination of the question as&nbsp; to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the decision of the commission turns on&nbsp; the credibility of the witnesses who testified before it. The jurisdiction of this court to set aside a decision of&nbsp; the commission is limited to cases where it clearly appears that there was no evidence to support reasonably&nbsp; such decision, or that the same is&nbsp; contrary to law,&nbsp; or that it was&nbsp; without the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the commission.&nbsp; We&nbsp; are unable&nbsp; to conclude that any&nbsp; of such grounds exists in the&nbsp; present case."&nbsp; (Cebu Autobus Company&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Bisaya Land Transportation Co., 66 Phil., 37 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., No. 4, p. 86, 63, 67-68.)<br></blockquote>The decision under review&nbsp; is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against petitioner.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
