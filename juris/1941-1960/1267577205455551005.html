				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff instituted this action in the Court of First Instance of Leyte 
praying that support be given her and her four children coupled with a petition 
for support <em>pendente lite</em>.
<p>Defendant in his answer set up as special defense that in the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu there is a case for legal separation pending between the same 
parties on the ground of adultery wherein the right of plaintiff to demand 
support is incidentally involved (Civil Code No. R-3196). This separation case 
was instituted earlier than the present one.</p>
<p>In view of the pendency of the separation case in Cebu, the court deemed it 
proper to hold in abeyance further action on the case for support for the reason 
that the case in Cebu "should have priority in order to ascertain the rights of 
the parties with particular reference to support in favor of the plaintiff." The 
court however modified later this ruling on the premise that, as the legal 
separation case might take a long time before it is finally disposed of, it is 
imperative that the matter of support be given preferential consideration.</p>
<p>Defendant moved to have this ruling reconsidered, and having failed in this 
attempt, he filed a motion to dismiss predicated on the same plea that there is 
between the same parties a casefor legal separation in the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu invoking in his favor the rule that a complaint may be 
dismissed where "there is another action pending between the same parties for 
the same cause." [Rule 8, section 1(<em>d</em>)] And on March 24, 1954, the 
court entered an order dismissing the case in line with the plea of the 
defendant. This is the order subject of the present appeal.</p>
<p>In order that an action may be dismissed on the ground that "there is another 
action pending between the same parties for the same cause" [Rule 8, section 
1(<em>d</em>)], the following requisites must concur: (1) identity of parties, 
or at least such as representing the same interests in both actions; (2) 
identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on 
the same facts; and (3) the identity in the two cases should be such that the 
judgment that may be rendered in one would, regardless of which party is 
successful, amount to <em>res adjudicata</em> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 
1952 ed., Vol. I, p. 169.) Do these requisites concur in the two cases under 
consideration?</p>
<p>An analysis of the facts deducible from the pleadings would reveal an 
affirmative answer. Note that the present action is for support not only of 
plaintiff but of her children. The action is predicated on the infidelity of 
defendant who bacause of his propensity towards other women made him neglectful 
of his marital duties. The case of legal separation, on the other hand, asserts 
adultery on the part of plaintiff which is a valid defense against an action for 
support (Quintana <em>vs</em>. Lerma, 24 Phil., 285). Our new Civil Code 
provides that the obligation to give support shall cease "when the recipient, be 
he aforced heir or not, has committed some act which gives rise to 
disinheritance" [Article 303 (4)], and under Article 921 of the same Code, it 
shall be sufficient cause for disinheritance "when spouse has given cause for 
legal separation." It further appears that in the separation case the wife 
interposed an answer wherein, repudiating the charge of adultery, she demanded 
that she and her children be given the proper maintenance and support to which 
thaey are entitled under the law.</p>
<p>All of the foregoing show that the two cases raise practically the same 
issues. There is therefore no need of prosecuting them separately and 
independently for that would amount to duplicity of action. And as it appears 
that the case of legal separation was instituted earlier than the one for 
support, it is fair that the latter be dismissed as was correctly done by the 
lower court.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Labrador, 
Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J.B.L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
