				<H3>JULIA TUMANENG, PETITIONER, VS. FRANCISCO ABAD, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On January 8, 1935, petitioner Julia Tumaneng sold a parcel of 
land situated in Matayag, Solsona, Ilocos Norte, to the respondent. The price 
was P995, and the vendor and her heirs were granted the right to repurchase it 
from the vendee and his heirs. On March 19, 1944, the respondent received from 
the petitioner the sum of P1,000 in Japanese war notes for the repurchase of the 
property. Receipt of this amount by the respondent appears at the back of the 
private deed of sale. The respondent continued in possession of the property 
even after the year 1944, so in 1946 petitioner brought this action to recover 
the value of the harvests on the land from the date of the repurchase. The Court 
of First Instance dismissed the action but gave petitioner one year from notice 
of the decision within which to repurchase the land for the sum of P995. Against 
this decision petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals. This court affirmed 
the judgment dismissing the case, but reversed it in so far as it granted 
petitioner the right to redeem the property, declaring respondent absolute owner 
of the property and its products from January 9, 1940. In arriving at this 
judgment, it held that the period for the repurchase of the property had expired 
on January 8, 1940, in accordance with the first paragraph of article 1508 of 
the Spanish Civil Code. Against this judgment petitioner has presented an appeal 
to this Court by certiorari.
<p align="justify">The disputed portion of the deed of sale executed between the 
parties contains the following stipulations:</p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>* * *. It is my agreement with Mr. Francisco Abad y Simon that 
after a year after which he shall have received the fruits of said lands, I 
shall have the right to redeem the land with the same amount of money that I 
received from him without any deduction. But if I will have yet no money with 
which to repurchase, I shall nevertheless together with my heirs have the 
freedom to repurchase the land and that he or his heirs will not be atle to 
refuse the repurchase provided, I could return the amount of one thousand pesos. 
It is also agreed with Sr. Francisco Abad y Simon that I will not exercise my 
right to repurchase at a time when the rice seedlings have already been prepared 
for the land but that I will wait until after the harvest.</blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner contends that there is an express agreement on the 
period of repurchase, within the meaning of paragraph 2 of article 1508 of the 
Civil Code. According to petitioner's contention, the right of repurchase may be 
exercised at any time, or for an unlimiated time. It is also argued that as the 
contract expressly provides that if the land is planted to rice when the right 
to repurchase is to be exercised, redemption can not be effected until after the 
harvest, every year the right to repurchase is revived upon termination of the 
harvest, and as no particular year when the harvest or seedling preparation is 
mentioned, the right must subsist from year to year. In. reply, respondent 
contends that no period has been fixed for redemption, arguing that the grant of 
freedom to repurchase is only a recognition of the right, whereas the use of the 
term "heirs" is to provide against the uncertainty of human life.</p>
<p align="justify">There is no question that the terms of the contract are not 
clear on the period of redemption. But the intent of the parties thereto is the 
law between them, and it must be ascertained and enforced. It must be gleaned 
from the language of the contract, as well as from the conduct of the parties. 
The parties expressly agreed that if the vendor could not repurchase the 
property after the expiration of one year from the time that the vendee receives 
the fruits of the land because of lack of funds, she or her heirs shall 
nevertheless have the freedom to repurchase the land from the vendee or his 
heirs, provided the amount of P1,000 be returned. In the first place, freedom to 
repurchase is expressly granted, which can be exercised only after one year from 
the time the vendee receives the fruits of the land, without any other 
limitation whatsoever except as to the price and the existing rice crop on the 
land. In the second place, the grant is made not to the vendor alone but also to 
her heirs, and against the vendee and his heirs also. Our inference from these 
circumstances is that an indefinite or an unlimited period of redemption was 
intended. The presence of the terms as "nevertheless" and "heirs" can be 
explained only by an intent to extend the period for an indefinite time. We may 
not ignore such terms and refuse to give them the effect that they naturally 
imply, which is an indefinite period. We are expressly enjoined by law (article 
1289, Civil Code) to adopt this form of interpretation of the contract, as it 
provides for the least transmission of rights and interests between the 
contracting parties. The right to redeem is, furthermore, a natural right, and a 
construction of the contract favoring it should be followed. (Section 6G, Eule 
123, Rules of Court.) </p>
<p align="justify">In the case of Rosales vs. Reyes and Ordovesa, 25 Phil., 495, 
the parties agreed "that the right to repurchase could not be exercised within 
three years from the date of the contract." This Court held that the most 
logical and just construction is one which would terminate the contract in ten 
years from the date of the execution. As grounds for this conclusion it 
explained that unless limited by the contract of the parties, it was generally 
held that the right to repurchase was perpetual. There was no limitation of the 
period either under the <span style="font-style: italic;">Partidas</span> or under the Roman Law. In modern times, 
however, it has been deemed advisable to limit the time within which the right 
to redemption can be exercised. This limitation is contained in Article 1508, 
paragraph 2, of the Civil Code. (Ibid., p. 497.) In the case at bar, redemption 
was prohibited in the first year, but thereafter the freedom to repurchase is 
expressly given even in favor of and against the heirs of the contracting 
parties, subject to another limitation, i.e., that redemption should not be 
exercised at a time when the seedlings for the land have already been prepared. 
The express recognition of the right to repurchase subject to no limitation 
whatsoever except those indicated necessarily implies that the period should be 
indefinite, under the principle <span style="font-style: italic;">inclusio unius est exclusio alterius</span>. </p>
<p align="justify">Our attention has been invited also to the case of Ban-dong vs. 
Austria, 31 Phil., 480, wherein this Court held that the statutory limitation of 
four years upon the right of redemption was not applicable. In that case the 
vendors stipulated "we will repurchase the land at the same price; neither of us 
to make any stipulation as to the interest on the money or products of the land, 
but in the month of March of any year, if we repurchase." This Court reasoned 
thus: "In the event that they could assert that right in the month of March of 
any year after the date of the contract, it could not be said that there was no 
express agreement authorizing them to do so. Similarly, if the vendor and her 
heirs in the case at bar have the right to repurchase the land without any 
limitation, except during those periods when rice seedlings have already been 
prepared for the land, it is evident that the parties intended that there be no 
limit to the time for redemption, because the planting of the land takes place 
every year.</p>
<p align="justify">Article 1508 of the Civil Code provides: <br></p><p align="justify"></p><blockquote>El derecho de que 
trata el articulo anterior durara, a falta de pacto expreso, cuatro anos 
contados desde la fecha del contrato. <br><p></p><p align="justify">En caso de estipulacion, el plazo no podra 
exceder de diez a√±os.</p></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">We have chosen the Spanish text because the transla'tions do 
not reflect the exact shade of thought conveyed by the two paragraphs of the 
article. Manresa explains the application of each of the paargraphs of the 
article thus: </p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>Viviendo ahora al precepto contenido en el art. 1.508, diremos 
que en el se provee a dos supuestos distintos: primero, el de que, habiendose 
convenido el retro, no se haya estipulado plazo para su duracion; y segundo, el 
de que se haya estipulado ese plazo. En el primer caso se entendera que la 
accion dura cuatro anos, contados desde la fecha del contrato; en el segundo, 
las partes habran njado el que tengan por conveniente, aunque siempre dentro del 
precepto de derecho necesario que determina que ese plazo no podra exceder de 
diez anos. (10 Manresa 276, 4th ed.)</blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">So that the first paragraph is applicable to a case where do 
period has been fixed for the redemption, "cuando no se haya estipulado plazo 
para su duracion"; and the second, when a period has been agreed upon. </p>
<p align="justify">We have examined the decisions upon which the Court of Appeals 
based its decision, and we find that in all of them the contracts did not 
mention any period of redemption. In the last case cited (Ali√±o vs. Adove, 42 
Phil. 302) this Court said that there is always a period applicable, either 
conventional or legal. The former is fixed by the parties and can not exceed ten 
years; the latter is fixed by law at four years. (Ibid., p. 304.) </p>
<p align="justify">In the case at bar we find an agreement on the period. The 
agreement contains the following provisions, namely, first, that redemption can 
not be effected within the first year counted from the time the vendee receives 
the fruits of the land; second, that even if redemption can not be effected at 
the end of the first year as specified above, the vendor and her heirs shall 
nevertheless have the right to redeem it from the vendee and his heirs; and 
third, that redemption can not be effected at a time when the seedlings for the 
land have already been prepared. The agreement, in our opinion, fixes an 
unlimited period, although this is not clear and unequivocal, due perhaps to 
faulty expression. When the parties stipulated that the vendor and her heirs 
shall nevertheless have the right to make the repurchase, they meant that they 
shall have the right to do so any time. We have here, therefore, not a case 
where <span style="font-style: italic;">no period</span> at all has been agreed upon, but one with a period which shall 
start after the first year the vendee receives the fruits of the land, and which 
shall, nevertheless, continue without limitation. In order to be applicable, the 
law (paragraph 2 of article 1508) requires the <span style="font-style: italic;">existence</span> of an agreement, not a 
definite or clear agreement on the period. The mere fact that the agreement is 
obtained by inference does not argue in favor of its non-existence. Lack of 
clearness in the language of the agreement should not be confused with silence; 
in other words, not because the language fixing the period is not clear, 
positive, and unequivocal, may we conclude that an express agreement is absent. 
</p>
<p align="justify">In resume we hold that the parties in the case at bar intended 
that the right of redemption could be exercised at any time after the first 
year, subject to the conditions established, but pursuant to paragraph 2 of 
Article 1508 of the Civil Code, the exercise of the right can be made only 
within ten years from the date of the contract. It follows, therefore, that the 
redemption, which was made in the year 1944, was effected within the period of 
time authorized by law (ten years), and the same is valid and effective between 
the parties. </p>
<p align="justify">With respect to the claim of petitioner for damages for the 
refusal of respondent to return the land, we find that petitioner should not be 
entitled thereto before he filed this action in May, 1946, because it does not 
appear that he ever had demanded the return of the property prior thereto. We 
also take judicial notice of the fact that the period of harvest in the 
Philippines is from November to January. Petitioner should be entitled to the 
owner's share in the products from the agricultural year 1946-1947. The 
respondent admitted that during that year he harvested <span style="font-style: italic;">six uyones</span>, one half of 
which is valued at P150.</p>
<p align="justify">He should be sentenced to pay this sum, and to account for the 
owner's share in the harvests thencefrom until he returns the possession of the 
land to petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify">For the foregoing considerations, we hereby reverse the 
judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we declare petitioner owner of the land in 
question and sentence the respondent to deliver the possession thereof to her. 
Respondent is hereby likewise ordered to pay petitioner the sum of P150 for the 
harvest of the year 1946-1947, and render an accounting of and deliver the 
owner's share in the harvests of all the years from the year 1947-1948, until he 
delivers the land to petitioner. Without costs. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor,</span> and
