				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition  seeking  to  enjoin respondent Judge from enforcing his order of  May 25, 1956  restraining the collection of the sum of P10,518.75 as  deficiency percentage taxes and to set aside the order he has issued denying the motion to dismiss the action  which gave rise to this  incident on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter.  This Court  gave due course to the petition  and issued the writ of preliminary injunction prayed for pending the determination of the case on the merits.<br><br>It appears that the Cebu Olympian Company, hereinafter designated  as plaintiff, filed an  action against the Collector  of Internal Revenue,  hereinafter designated as defendant, before the Court  of  First Instance of Cebu to enjoin the latter from  collecting  certain  deficiency  percentage taxes and, incidentally, to recover consequential and  moral damages as  an incident thereto.  It is alleged that on November 12, 1955 defendant addressed to plaintiff a communication  informing it  that it was deficient in the  payment of  certain percentage  taxes  amounting to P8,375.00 which, in  addition to the  compromise fee of P50  and  a surcharge of 25 percent, makes a  grand total of P10,518.75;  that  on November   21,  1955,  plaintiff, through  counsel,  answered defendant's letter  to the  effect that it is not deficient in the payment of  any  percentage tax as shown by certain official receipts it has  in its possession;  that on December 19, 1955,  defendant wrote another letter to plaintiff informing it that it had employed a business agent in  effecting the  payment of  the aforesaid taxes and, as  a  consequence,  it  must  suffer for any irregularity that said agent  may commit  giving rise to the deficiency in  the  payment of its taxes; that considering  said  claim  to be incorrect,  plaintiff retorted on  January 11, 1956 stating that it had never employed a business  agent in effecting  the payment  of its  taxes,  the truth being that it had paid the same directly to the office of the city treasurer of Cebu by way of checks issued by the plaintiff; that notwithstanding the full payment made by plaintiff of the percentage taxes claimed by defendant, the latter has threatened, and is threatening,  to levy on plaintiff's property thereby causing irreparable damage to plaintiff's business and goodwill;  and that because  of defendant's act in levying on the properties of plaintiff for the purpose of compelling it to pay taxes which had  been already paid, plaintiff has suffered consequential and moral damages in the amount of P8,000.00.  Plaintiff, therefore, prayed for a writ of preliminary injunction pending determination of this case on the merits, which was granted <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> upon a bond in  the amount of P10,518,75. <br><br>On June 18, 1956, defendant moved to dismiss the  complaint on the ground of lack of  jurisdiction, it being his contention that this case  should have been taken  to  the Court  of Tax Appeals which has exclusive jurisdiction to review on appeal all decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases  of disputed  assessments,  refund  of internal revenue taxes, fees,  and other  charges, penalties impose in relation  thereto, and other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue  Code, or other law or  part of law administered by the Collector of Internal Revenue, in accordance with Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125.   On July 6, 1956, the  court denied the motion to dismiss and ordered defendant to enter his plea to the complaint  within the reglementary  period.   And when his motion for reconsideration was  denied,  defendant interposed the present petition for certiorari. <br><br>The question  for determination  is  whether the main case may be taken cognizance of by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> or it should be brought on appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals under  Section 7 of Republic Act No. 1125 in the exercise of its exclusive appellate  jurisdiction. The section above  referred  to  provides, among others, as follows: <br><blockquote>"Sec. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Jurisdiction</span>—The Court  of Tax  Appeals shall exercise exclusive  appellate  jurisdiction  to  review  by  appeal,  as herein provided—<br><br>"(1) Decision of the  Collector of Internal Revenue in eases involving  disputed assessments, refunds of  internal revenue  taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal  Revenue Code or other law  or  part  of law administered by  the Bureau of  Internal Revenue; * * *."</blockquote>From  what appears  in the  complaint in the  light of the provisions above quoted,  there can be  no question that this case comes within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals for  undoubtedly its subject-matter comes within  the purview of  the  words "disputed assessments," or of "other matters  arising under the  National Internal Revenue  Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal  Revenue", specifically mentioned therein.  This is inferable not only from the allegations of the complaint itself,  but  also from the writ of preliminary injunction granted by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> on May  25,  1956, commanding  the  defendant,  his  agents, subordinates  or persons acting in  his  behalf, to  comply with the order of the  court to refrain or desist from levying  by  way  of  distraint on  plaintiff's  properties.   The power conferred by law upon the Collector of Internal Revenue to institute administrative remedies to collect taxes by means  of distraint and levy on the property  of  any delinquent taxpayer  is embodied  in Chapter II, Sections 315-330, of the National Internal Revenue Code. <br><br>Indeed, plaintiff in the present case seeks not only to contest  the collection  of  deficiency  percentage  taxes, surcharges  or  compromises  demanded  in the several letters addressed to it by defendant, but also to dispute the legality or propriety of the levy by distraint on the properties of the plaintiff by reason of  its failure  or refusal to meet the demand on the alleged reason that it has  already fully paid the taxes demanded from it.  The case is, therefore, an indirect appeal from the decision of the Collector of Internal  Revenue on the assessment made by him with regard  to certain  deficiency percentage taxes,  as well as from his decision to collect the same by the coercive summary  measures  prescribed by law,  matters  which  come within  the  exclusive jurisdiction  of the  Court of  Tax Appeals. <br><br>It is true that plaintiff claims that it has already fully paid the  deficiency taxes  demanded from it  by the  defendant, but this claim alone cannot take this  case out of the jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals, for the same still comes  within the  purview  of the words <span style="font-style: italic;">disputed assessment</span>.   The correctness or  incorrectness of  a  tax assessment  is for  that  court to  determine and not  for the regular courts of justice.  Nor can this case be placed beyond the jurisdiction of that  court simply because certain consequential  or moral damages are  demanded,  for they are  but incidental  to the main case.  This  can be passed  upon by  that court if  and  when the  evidence so warrants. <br><br>This case comes squarely within the frame  of the decision rendered in Millares, et al., vs. Judge Amparo, et al.,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 51 Off. Gaz., 3462.  That was a  case of mandamus to compel  the Collector  of  Customs to  surrender certain  merchandise impounded  by  the latter for the failure of  the importer to  obtain the necessary certificate of release from the Central Bank.  Upon petition <span style="font-style: italic;">ex  parte</span>, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> granted the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction. The motion to dissolve  the writ having failed, the  case was taken to the  Supreme Court by  way of certiorari, and one of  the questions  raised was whether "since  the creation of the Court of  Tax Appeals by Republic Act No. 1125, the Manila courts of first instance have lost jurisdiction over customs  cases."  The Court, in upholding the affirmative,  made the following  pronouncement:  <br><blockquote>"Republic  Act No. 1125, section 7, effective June 16,  19B4, gave the  Court  of Tax Appeals  exclusive  appellate  jurisdiction,  to review on appeal, decisions of the  Commissioner  of  Customs,  involving 'seizure,  detention or release of property affected * * * or other matters arising under the Customs law or other  law administered by  the Bureau  of Customs'.  In our opinion this provision necessarily  has taken  away  the  power  of the Manila  Courts  of First Instance to 'review', decisions of the Customs authorities,  'in any case  of seizure'—as in this  case—under  section  1383 et  seq. of the Revised Administrative  Code. <br><br>"Consequently, the respondent judge had no authority to entertain the complaints  of  Serree  Investments, Lim  Hu and Fructuoso Nepomuceno,  which,  although entitled  Mandamus  and  Certiorari were in reality petitions to review the actuations of the proper customs authorities,  now exclusively revicwable by the Court  of Tax Appeals (R. A. 1125).   Furthermore, conceding that the  complaints were strictly  mandamus or certiorari civil actions,  still  they were groundless,  the  petitioners  having  an adequate  remedy by  appeal, as  stated to  the Court  of  Tax  Appeals.   Neither certiorari  nor mandamus, it will be recalled, is available where relief  by appeal  is provided.  Therefore, the  complaints  having  no   merit, issuance of the  preliminary  mandatory  injunctions  was clearly  erroneous, and  the challenged writs should be annulled. <br><br>"This conclusion makes it useless to pass  on  the question whether Circular No. 45  of the  Central Bank prohibits the importation of this  garlic shipment, and whether it is valid under the  law, because the  above is  sufficient  to  dispose of these  litigations.  Neither  is it  necessary  to  discuss  the issue  for guidance in  connection  with future importations, because  Republic  Act  No. 1296,  effective  on the 18th of this month  prohibits,  with penal sanctions, the importation  of  garlic, potatoes, etc., except for seedling purposes, which is  not  the case. <br><br>"WHEREFORE, the preliminary writs of injunction heretofore issued are  hereby made   permanent.  The writs complained  of  are annulled.  Costs  shall  be paid by  the respondents importers.  So ordered."  (31 Off. Gaz., pp. 3464-3465).</blockquote>Wherefore,  petition  is  granted.   The  orders  involved herein are  hereby  set aside and  the injunction issued  by this Court  made permanent, with costs against respondent Cebu Olympian  Company.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
