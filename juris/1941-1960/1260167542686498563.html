				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Domingo Cadiang, Santiago Yumul and Filemon Cenzon appeal from&nbsp; a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga finding&nbsp; them and their co-defendants, who did not appeal, guilty&nbsp; of murder for the&nbsp; death&nbsp; of Pablo Navarro and sentencing them to suffer r<span style="font-style: italic;">eclusion perpetua</span> and to pay indemnity and the proportionate share in the costs&nbsp; (Criminal Case No. 1262).<br><br>In&nbsp; the evening of 16 October 1950, between 8:00 and 9:00&nbsp; o'clock, Eulogio&nbsp; Serrano told Cenon Serrano&nbsp; alias Piping,&nbsp; Domingo&nbsp; Cadiang,&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Yumul,&nbsp; Filemon Cenzon and&nbsp; Anastacio Reyes then gathered at the sola of the house&nbsp; of the first in the barrio of Potrero, Bacolor, Pampanga, that Pablo Navarro had been inducing and prompting people to call on&nbsp; Senator Pablo Angeles David and testify on the Maliwalu massacre, and for that reason he&nbsp; manifested to them his&nbsp; desire and&nbsp; plan to&nbsp; do away with&nbsp; Navarro.&nbsp; Eulogio Serrano instructed them to wait for Navarro&nbsp; in the town of Bacolor, lure him to go with them to barrio&nbsp; Dolores and there kill him.&nbsp; After disclosing to them his&nbsp;&nbsp; plan,&nbsp; Eulogio&nbsp; Serrano&nbsp; told them to&nbsp; go to sleep at the post&nbsp; of the&nbsp; civilian guards&nbsp; near his house.&nbsp; In pursuance of the plan, the next day (17 October), Cenon Serrano <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Piping, Domingo Cadiang, Santiago Yumul, Filemon&nbsp; Cenzon and Anastacio&nbsp; Reyes waited for&nbsp; Pablo&nbsp; Navarro&nbsp; at&nbsp; the gambling&nbsp; casino and Chinese&nbsp; stores in the town of Bacolor&nbsp; where he&nbsp; used to&nbsp; hang around.&nbsp; Navarro&nbsp; did&nbsp; not&nbsp; show up that day. The following day (18 October), the group&nbsp; waited for him at the&nbsp; same places.&nbsp; This time Navarro&nbsp; showed&nbsp; up at&nbsp; the gambling casino and&nbsp; Cenon Serrano <span style="font-style: italic;">alias&nbsp; </span>Piping promptly invited him to a&nbsp; drink but&nbsp; Navarro declined saying that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was going&nbsp; somewhere.&nbsp; On 19 October, the group again waited for their&nbsp; quarry&nbsp; at the&nbsp; same places&nbsp; but failed to make contact with him as he&nbsp; did not show up.&nbsp; At&nbsp; about 10:00&nbsp; o'clock in&nbsp; the morning of 20&nbsp; October,&nbsp; the group waited for Navarro in&nbsp; the same&nbsp; places.&nbsp; Navarro arrived&nbsp; at the gambling casino between&nbsp; 1:00&nbsp; and 2:00 o'clock in the&nbsp; afternoon.&nbsp; Cenon Serrano alias Piping asked him for some drinks.&nbsp; Navarro ordered some&nbsp; drinks and all in the group except Cenon Serrano alias Piping drank.&nbsp; After drinking the contents of six bottles of Black&nbsp; Dog gin, Orange&nbsp; Wine&nbsp; and Sy Hoc Tong&nbsp; wine,&nbsp; Navarro&nbsp; asked&nbsp; Cenon&nbsp; Serrano&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Piping whether what&nbsp; they had drunk&nbsp; was&nbsp; enough,&nbsp; and the latter answered "No, look for some more."&nbsp; Navarro left the gambling casino, went to the market place about 20 meters away and came back accompanied&nbsp; by Simplicio Manguerra&nbsp; bringing four bottles&nbsp; of&nbsp; Orange&nbsp; wine&nbsp; and Sy&nbsp; Hoc&nbsp; Tong&nbsp; wine.&nbsp; Simplicio Manguerra joined&nbsp; the party and all except Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias Piping&nbsp; drank the four bottles of&nbsp; wine.&nbsp; While the spree was going, on, Cenon Serrano alias Piping&nbsp; suggested to Pablo Navarro that they should go to San Fernando for a&nbsp; "good time," to&nbsp; which&nbsp; suggestion&nbsp; Navarro&nbsp; agreed.&nbsp; Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias&nbsp; Piping sent&nbsp; out Domingo Oadiang to look&nbsp; for&nbsp; a jeep,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Cadiang&nbsp; returned&nbsp; with an&nbsp; auto calesa jeep driven by Marcelino&nbsp; Sicate.&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking&nbsp; the four bottles&nbsp; of wine, Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias&nbsp; Piping,&nbsp; Domingo Cadiang,&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Yumul,&nbsp; Filemon Cenzon, Pablo&nbsp; Navarro,&nbsp; Simplicio Manguerra and Anastacio Reyes boarded the jeep, the first and the last&nbsp; sitting&nbsp; at the front with the driver and the rest inside.&nbsp; From the gambling&nbsp; casino the party&nbsp; repaired&nbsp; to Don Q&nbsp; gasoline station to&nbsp; refuel and proceeded to&nbsp; San Fernando.&nbsp; But before reaching San Fernando,&nbsp; Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias&nbsp; Piping remarked that&nbsp; "there is&nbsp; no use&nbsp; having a&nbsp; good&nbsp; time"&nbsp; in&nbsp; San Fernando&nbsp; and&nbsp; suggested&nbsp; that&nbsp; they should&nbsp; proceed to Angeles&nbsp; for the "good time" which suggestion Navarro approved.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way&nbsp; to Angeles Cenon Serrano <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Piping&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the driver to&nbsp; stop at Tony's Place in San Fernando to&nbsp; buy some more&nbsp; wine.&nbsp; After&nbsp; buying another jar of San&nbsp; Miguel gin, part&nbsp; of&nbsp; which Navarro who was&nbsp; already&nbsp; drunk was made to drink,&nbsp; the&nbsp; party resumed their trip; but upon reaching a small&nbsp; road near the schoolhouse of barrio San Isidro, Cenon Serrano alias Piping told&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver to&nbsp; proceed&nbsp; to barrio Dolores, Bacolor,&nbsp; where&nbsp; they arrived at&nbsp; about 4:00&nbsp; o'clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; There Cenon Serrano&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Piping&nbsp; dismissed the. driver of the&nbsp; jeep.&nbsp; At barrio Dolores, the group&nbsp; passed by&nbsp; the house of&nbsp; Simeon&nbsp; Dizon, the barrio lieutenant, told him to come down and ordered him to call&nbsp; for&nbsp; some temporary policemen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; seeing&nbsp; Benjamin&nbsp; Tolentino at&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; of Dizon,&nbsp; Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias Piping beckoned and&nbsp; ordered Tolentino to tie Navarro's hands with&nbsp; rope.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; Cenon Serrano's&nbsp; order Felipe Garcia,&nbsp; a civilian guard who came with Simeon Dizon, pointed a gun at Navarro.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter asked&nbsp; Cenon Serrano&nbsp; alias Piping why he was being&nbsp; tied and&nbsp; Cenon Serrano&nbsp; alias Piping answered "You deserve to be&nbsp; tied up because you are against us."&nbsp;&nbsp; Navarro was brought to&nbsp; the stockade&nbsp; of the civilian&nbsp; guards&nbsp; where&nbsp; he&nbsp; was questioned and&nbsp; accused Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias&nbsp; Piping of bringing witnesses to the house of Senator Pablo Angeles David to&nbsp; testify on the Maliwalu&nbsp; massacre.&nbsp; As Navarro denied the charge, Cenon Serrano alias Piping hit Navarro with his fist, struck him with the&nbsp; butt of his&nbsp; .45 caliber pistol&nbsp; and ordered Domingo Cadiang to beat up Navarro. Cadiang did as he was ordered&nbsp; by beating up Navarro with a piece of bamboo about 4&nbsp; inches in diameter and less than a meter long.&nbsp; As a result of the beating Navarro fell down.&nbsp; Cenon Serrano alias Piping kicked him and ordered him to rise, and as Navarro was rising Cadiang hit him on the back, so Navarro&nbsp; again fell down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cenon Serrano alias Piping then&nbsp; told Filemon&nbsp; Cenzon to&nbsp; beat up Navarro and Cenzon with&nbsp; the same piece&nbsp; of bamboo struck Navarro on his back about the&nbsp; waistline&nbsp; as he made&nbsp; an&nbsp; effort to stand up. Cenon Serrano alias Piping returned to where the jeep was parked and ordered Felipe Garcia to tie the hands of Simplicio Manguerra.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing the order of Cenon Serrano alias Piping, Simplicio Manguerra asked whether&nbsp; he was to be killed.&nbsp; Cenon Serrano answered "I will also have you killed, you son of a whore."&nbsp; Manguerra&nbsp; clung to Anastacio Reyes begging for mercy but the&nbsp; latter disengaged himself from&nbsp; him. Cenon Serrano alias Piping pushed Manguerra and ordered Santiago&nbsp; Yumul to beat him up.&nbsp; Santiago Yumul hit Manguerra with a&nbsp; pestle on the&nbsp; back.&nbsp; Jilanguerra fell to the ground.&nbsp; Then Cenon Serrano alias Piping ordered Domingo Cadiang and Felipe Garcia to bring Manguerra to the post behind the stockade.&nbsp; At this juncture Basilio de Guzman arrived and&nbsp; was ordered by Cenon Serrano alias Piping to kill&nbsp; Manguerra.&nbsp; De Guzman and&nbsp; Garcia brought Manguerra to&nbsp; a field in Dolores where De&nbsp; Guzman dug a&nbsp; pit while&nbsp; Garcia stood guard; and&nbsp; after digging the&nbsp; pit De Guzman shot Manguerra twice and shoved Manguerra's body in the pit and covered it&nbsp; with earth.&nbsp; Afterwards, Cenon Serrano alias Piping, Domingo Cadiang, Santiago Yumul, Filemon Cenzon and&nbsp; Anastacio Reyes repaired to the house of Eulogio Serrano in barrio Potrero to report&nbsp; to&nbsp; him&nbsp; that&nbsp; the, two victims&nbsp; were already in barrio Dolores,&nbsp; arriving at barrio Potrero at past 5:00 o'clock in the&nbsp; afternoon.&nbsp; As Eulogio Serrano was&nbsp; not&nbsp; in his house when Cenon Serrano&nbsp; alias&nbsp; Piping arrived, the latter boarded the jeep of the late&nbsp; Maximino Serrano and&nbsp; drove on it to the town of Bacolor together with Domingo Cadiang, Santiago&nbsp; Yumul, Filemon Cenzon and&nbsp; Anastacio&nbsp; Reyes.&nbsp; Upon reaching the second bridge at barrio San Antonio on&nbsp; the way&nbsp; to Bacolor, Santiago Yumul alighted.&nbsp; The rest resumed&nbsp; driving to&nbsp; town and met&nbsp; Eulogio Serrano in front of the schoolhouse at barrio San&nbsp; Agustin&nbsp; driving a&nbsp; jeep.&nbsp; Cenon Serrano alias Piping reported to Eulogio Serrano that the two men were already in barrio Dolores.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eulogio told Cenon that he would go to Dolores.&nbsp;&nbsp; Domingo Cadiang was left in the barrio of San&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; while&nbsp; Filemon Cenzon, Cenon&nbsp; Serrano&nbsp; alias Piping and&nbsp; Anastacio&nbsp; Reyes proceeded&nbsp; to&nbsp; the town of Bacolor.<br><br>In the afternoon of 20 October&nbsp; 1950, while&nbsp; Emiliano Manalo&nbsp; known also&nbsp; as Isaias, a civilian guard, was in his&nbsp; house at&nbsp; barrio&nbsp; Dolores&nbsp; Bacolor, Pampanga,&nbsp; Benjamin Tolentino came and&nbsp; asked him to&nbsp; help him dig a pit at sitio Oastilang Malati, barrio&nbsp; Dolores, to bury a dead horse of Atilano&nbsp; Gopez.&nbsp;&nbsp; He acceded&nbsp; to his request and helped Tolentino dig it.&nbsp;&nbsp; After digging the&nbsp; pit he went home and then&nbsp; proceeded to his post in sitio Pigulut Mauli, barrio&nbsp; Dolores.&nbsp; Upon reaching his post he&nbsp; was called by Eulogio Serrano who was outside&nbsp; the stockade together with&nbsp; Atilano Gopez, Melchor Esguerra&nbsp; and Benjamin Tolentino talking with&nbsp; another person&nbsp; inside the stockade who&nbsp; he later on&nbsp; learned was Pablo&nbsp; Navarro. He&nbsp; heard Eulogio Serrano ask "Ambo, are&nbsp; you the one bringing those&nbsp; people from&nbsp; Maliwalu&nbsp; to&nbsp; Don&nbsp; Pablo? Navarro answered&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was not&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; one,&nbsp; Eulogio Serrano then&nbsp; told Atilano Gopez to take Pablo Navarro out of the stockade&nbsp; and to bring him along with&nbsp; them (Eulogio&nbsp; Serrano,&nbsp; Atilano&nbsp; Gopez, Benjamin&nbsp; Tolentino, Melchor Esguerra and Emiliano Manalo) to barrio Potrero. When they reached sitio Castilang Malati Eulogio Serrano ordered Melchor Esguerra&nbsp; and&nbsp; Benjamin&nbsp; Tolentino to shoot Pablo&nbsp; Navarro&nbsp; from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Melchor&nbsp; Esguerra and Benjamin Tolentino fired one shot each simultaneously. Navarro fell down dead.&nbsp; Eulogio Serrano&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; them to bring the dead body of Pablo&nbsp; Navarro to the pit&nbsp; that Benjamin Tolentino&nbsp; and Emiliano&nbsp; Manalo&nbsp; had dug and to cover it with earth.&nbsp; Afterwards,&nbsp; they&nbsp; walked&nbsp; back to barrio Dolores.&nbsp; Sometime after the elections in November 1951, Atilano Gopez ordered Emiliano&nbsp; Manalo and Benjamin Tolentino to exhume the bones of the late Pablo Navarro, put them in a sack and threw them into a creek. On 6 December 1951 the chief of police of Bacolor, Benjamin Tolentino, Melchor Esguerra, Eulogio Serrano and Emiliano Manalo, accompanied by Constabulary soldiers, exhumed the bones of the late Pablo&nbsp; Navarro.<br><br>On&nbsp; 17&nbsp; December 1951,&nbsp; Cenon Serrano&nbsp; alias&nbsp; Piping, Benjamin, Tolentino, Melchor Esguerra, Domingo Cadiang, Santiago Yumul,&nbsp; Filemon&nbsp; Cenzon&nbsp; and&nbsp; Anastacio Reyes were charged with illegal detention with murder&nbsp; for the death of Pablo&nbsp; Navarro in an&nbsp; information filed by the provincial&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; of Pampanga.&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 12&nbsp; February&nbsp; 1952, upon motion of the assistant provincial fiscal, the Court ordered the&nbsp; discharge&nbsp; of Anastacio&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; from&nbsp; the information to testify as witness for the prosecution.&nbsp; Eulogio Serrano was charged with the same crime in criminal case No. 1819 but has not yet been apprehended.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cenon Serrano alias Piping charged&nbsp; with the&nbsp; same&nbsp; crime was also at&nbsp; large but later&nbsp; on&nbsp; arrested and brought&nbsp; to&nbsp; trial with his co-defendants in both criminal cases for the death of Pablo Navarro&nbsp; (case No. 1262)&nbsp; and for the death of Simplicio Manguerra (case No.&nbsp; 1263).&nbsp; The evidence for the prosecution&nbsp; heard&nbsp; against&nbsp; his co-defendants before his arrest and arraignment was&nbsp; again presented to afford him the opportunity to&nbsp; confront and cross-examine the witnesses.<br><br>After a joint trial with criminal&nbsp;&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 1263 for the death&nbsp; of Simplicio Manguerra,&nbsp; the Court found.—<br><blockquote>*&nbsp; * *&nbsp; Cenon Serrano alias Piping,&nbsp; Benjamin Tolentino, Melchor Esguerra, Domingo Cadiang, Santiago Yumul and&nbsp; Filemon Cenzon guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the&nbsp; crime of murder in Criminal Case No. 1262 (for the death of Pablo Navarro) and, appreciating No&nbsp; aggravating -or mitigating circumstance, hereby sentences each to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua.</span>&nbsp; They are also&nbsp; sentenced to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of Pablo Navarro in the sum&nbsp; of P6,000.00 and to pay their proportionate shares of the costs.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *.<br></blockquote>Only&nbsp; Domingo&nbsp; Cadiang,&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Yumul and&nbsp; Filemon Cenzon have appealed.<br><br>The&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; deny&nbsp; having&nbsp; been&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; house&nbsp; of Eulogio Serrano&nbsp; at barrio&nbsp; Potrero,&nbsp; Bacolor,&nbsp; Pampanga, in the evening of 16 October 1950, when Eulogio&nbsp; Serrano told them&nbsp; to lure Pablo Navarro to&nbsp; barrio Dolores and to kill him there.&nbsp; Domingo Cadiang claims that on&nbsp; 16 October 1950 he was&nbsp; at the&nbsp; farm of Paquito Liongson in the barrio of San Antonio helping his in-laws thresh palay that they had promised and agreed to do; and that on&nbsp; 17, 18 and 19 October&nbsp; he was&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; yard of&nbsp; his house&nbsp; cutting&nbsp; kapok&nbsp; trees&nbsp; for&nbsp; fuel.&nbsp; Filemon Cenzon claims that&nbsp; on 16 October 1950, between 8:00 and&nbsp; 9:00 o'clock in the&nbsp; evening, he&nbsp; was in the market place&nbsp; of Bacolor;&nbsp; that on&nbsp; 17 October up&nbsp; to the early morning of&nbsp; 18 October,&nbsp; he was&nbsp; at&nbsp; Bagac&nbsp; Bay hauling&nbsp; lumber; that at about 11:00 o'clock in the morning of 18 October he&nbsp; was&nbsp; already in&nbsp; Bacolor where&nbsp; he&nbsp; refilled&nbsp; the&nbsp; tank of his truck with&nbsp; petrol and thereafter he together&nbsp; with Juanito Bognot proceeded to Dagupan to deliver lumber for his employer, Manuel Joseph, to the Liberty Lumber; and that he returned to Bacolor at about&nbsp; 11:00 o'clock in the morning of the next&nbsp; day, 19 October, and brought his truck to the garage&nbsp; of&nbsp; the company and went home. Santiago&nbsp; Yumul,&nbsp; corroborated&nbsp; by&nbsp; Martin&nbsp; Tuason and Martin Yumul,&nbsp; claims that&nbsp; from 16 to 19&nbsp; October&nbsp; 1950 he&nbsp; was working as laborer&nbsp; for Martin Tuason to remove a railroad&nbsp; track&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Pampanga Sugar&nbsp; Development Company leading&nbsp; to Magalang, Pampanga; and&nbsp; for that reason&nbsp; he&nbsp; could not&nbsp; have&nbsp; been with&nbsp; Eulogio&nbsp; Serrano, Cenon Serrano <span style="font-style: italic;">alias&nbsp;</span> Piping, Domingo Cadiang and&nbsp; Filemon&nbsp; Cenzon in the evening&nbsp; of 16 October at the house of Eulogio&nbsp; Serrano, and from&nbsp; 17 to 19 October in the&nbsp; town of&nbsp; Bacolor&nbsp; waiting&nbsp; for Pablo Navarro to carry out the plan&nbsp; of&nbsp; luring him to barrio Dolores and there kill him. And&nbsp; although&nbsp; they&nbsp; admit to have been in the company of&nbsp; Cenon Serrano alias Piping and Anastacio Reyes, who they claim&nbsp; brought Pablo&nbsp; Navarro and&nbsp; Simplicio&nbsp; Manguerra to barrio Dolores in the jeep driven by Marcelino Sicat on 20&nbsp; October 1950, yet they disclaim any knowledge of&nbsp; the plot to&nbsp; kill&nbsp; them, and that if&nbsp; they ever took a hand in&nbsp; maltreating the victims&nbsp; it was out&nbsp; of&nbsp; fear to Anastacio&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; and Cenon Serrano&nbsp; alias&nbsp; Piping, the latter ordering them to inflict injury upon the victims at the point of a gun.<br><br>The weak defense&nbsp; of alibi&nbsp; put&nbsp; up by the appellants to disprove complicity in&nbsp; the&nbsp; murder of Pablo&nbsp; Navarro cannot&nbsp; overcome&nbsp; the&nbsp; clear and&nbsp; positive&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of Anastacio Reyes that they were at&nbsp; the house of Eulogio Serrano&nbsp; in the evening&nbsp; of&nbsp; 16 October&nbsp; 1950 when&nbsp; the latter told&nbsp; them to lure Pablo&nbsp; Navarro to barrio Dolores and there kill him; and that they were&nbsp; together on&nbsp; 17. 18 and&nbsp; 19&nbsp; October waiting for&nbsp; Pablo&nbsp; Navarro in&nbsp; the town&nbsp; of Bacolor to lure&nbsp; him&nbsp; to barrio Dolores, and&nbsp; on 20 October when they finally succeeded in luring him to barrio Dolores where&nbsp; they&nbsp; killed him.&nbsp; It is difficult to believe&nbsp; that&nbsp; a man who had&nbsp; made up&nbsp; his&nbsp; mind to kill another&nbsp; would bring&nbsp; along with him other persons who know nothing about the plan&nbsp; just to&nbsp; witness&nbsp; the commission of the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they were not&nbsp; in the know, as they&nbsp; contend, they also would have been&nbsp; done&nbsp; away with&nbsp; right then&nbsp; and there, in the&nbsp; same way&nbsp; Simplicio Manguerra,&nbsp; who was not to&nbsp; be killed, had been done away with,&nbsp; to prevent him from reporting&nbsp; to the&nbsp; authorities or&nbsp; from testifying against them in Court;&nbsp; or they&nbsp; also would&nbsp; have been&nbsp; sent away upon arriving at barrio Dolores,&nbsp; in the same&nbsp; way that Marcelino&nbsp; Sicat. the driver of the jeep on which they rode&nbsp; in&nbsp; going to the said barrio, was sent away.&nbsp; The way the appellants were&nbsp; seated in the jeep&nbsp; in going&nbsp; to&nbsp; barrio Dolores— Anastacio&nbsp; Reyes and Cenon Serrano alias Piping at the front seat with the driver&nbsp; and the three appellants on the two parallel seats&nbsp; inside&nbsp; the jeep—belies the&nbsp; assertion that they were&nbsp; prevented by&nbsp; Cenon&nbsp; Serrano&nbsp; alias Piping&nbsp; and&nbsp; Anastacio&nbsp; Reyes&nbsp; from&nbsp; running&nbsp; away upon learning that a criminal&nbsp; act was to be&nbsp; committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The assertion that Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias Piping pointed his gun at&nbsp; them at the gasoline station, where&nbsp; they stopped to refuel, to&nbsp; prevent them from deserting, is&nbsp; unbelievable, because&nbsp; the&nbsp; gasoline station is located&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; heart of the town of&nbsp; Bacolor,&nbsp; in a busy street where the slightest commotion&nbsp; or any sign&nbsp; of distress would&nbsp; easily draw the attention&nbsp; of the nearby&nbsp; traffic officer directing&nbsp; the traffic.<br><br>The fact that in the evening of 16&nbsp; October 1950,&nbsp; the three appellants and their co-defendants&nbsp; were&nbsp; gathered at&nbsp; the&nbsp; house of&nbsp; Eulogio Serrano, over-all&nbsp; commander of the civilian guard and temporary police organizations, who ordered them&nbsp; to lure Pablo Navarro to barrio Dolores and to kill him&nbsp; there, because he had been inducing and prompting people to call on Senator Pablo Angeles David to&nbsp; inform him&nbsp; about and to testify&nbsp; on&nbsp; the Maliwalu massacre; that pursuant to the plan laid&nbsp; out by Eulogio Serrano, from 17 to 20 October 1950 the appellants joined Cenon Serrano alias Piping and Anastacio Reyes in waiting for Pablo&nbsp; Navarro at the gambling casino and&nbsp; Chinese stores in the town of Bacolor where he used to frequent: that they were actually with Cenon Serrano alias Piping and Anastacio Reyes when Pablo Navarro was lured to go&nbsp; to Dolores on&nbsp; the pretext of going to San Fernando and then to Angeles&nbsp; for a "good time" after&nbsp; a drinking spree in Bacolor; that they took turns in&nbsp; manhandling the victim as he was hogtied and rendered helpless; and the fact that the&nbsp; appellants went into hiding after&nbsp; the incident together with Cenon&nbsp; Serrano&nbsp; alias Piping in the barrio of Escribania, show that they were in league with Eulogio&nbsp; Serrano and Cenon&nbsp; Serrano alias Piping to&nbsp; kill Pablo&nbsp; Navarro.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each&nbsp; of them&nbsp; is, therefore, guilty&nbsp; as co-principal.<br><br>The appellants contend&nbsp; further that in order that the testimony of a conspirator may be admissible in evidence against his co-conspirator, it must appear and be shown by&nbsp; evidence other than the admission itself&nbsp; that&nbsp; the conspiracy actually existed and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; person who is to be bound by the&nbsp; admission was a&nbsp; privy to&nbsp; the conspiracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as there is&nbsp; nothing but the lone testimony of prosecution witness Anastacio Reyes, a co-conspirator, the trial court erred in&nbsp; finding that conspiracy&nbsp; has been established and&nbsp; in convicting the appellants based upon the lone testimony of their co-conspirator.&nbsp; The contention does not merit serious consideration, because the rule that "The act&nbsp; or declaration of a&nbsp; conspirator relating to the conspiracy and during its existence, may be given in evidence against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such act or declaration," <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> applies&nbsp; only&nbsp; to&nbsp; extra-judicial&nbsp; acts&nbsp; or&nbsp; declaration, but not to testimony&nbsp; given&nbsp; on the stand at the trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; where the defendant has the&nbsp; opportunity&nbsp; to cross-examine the declarant.&nbsp; And while&nbsp; the testimony&nbsp; of accomplices&nbsp; or confederates in crime is always subject to&nbsp; grave suspicion, "coming as it does from a polluted source," and should be received with&nbsp; great&nbsp; caution&nbsp; and doubtingly examined, it is nevertheless&nbsp; admissible and competent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The trial court&nbsp; did not err in convicting the appellants. For lack of sufficient number of votes to impose the death penalty,&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed,&nbsp; with the proportionate&nbsp; costs against the&nbsp; appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
