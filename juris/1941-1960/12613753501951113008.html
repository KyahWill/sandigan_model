				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For having lifted the&nbsp; order of default he had previously issued against&nbsp; the defendant in Civil Case&nbsp; No. 26213 of the Manila&nbsp; Court of First instance, the respondent judge is impleaded&nbsp; together with such defendant and others in this petition for&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; and mandamus.<br><br>In said case,&nbsp; Prudential Bank &amp; Trust Co., sued Saura Import &amp; Export Co.,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; to collect P275,624.62 on a letter of credit, bank draft and trust receipt.&nbsp; Upon its request,&nbsp; the Sheriff of&nbsp; Davao levied&nbsp; preliminary attachment&nbsp; on two parcels of&nbsp; land&nbsp; in Davao&nbsp; belonging to defendant, and&nbsp; caused its annotation&nbsp; in the Office&nbsp; of the Register of&nbsp; Deeds.&nbsp; Summons having been duly served, defendant failed to answer&nbsp; on time.&nbsp; Consequently, upon Prudential&nbsp; Bank's petition,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Court defaulted&nbsp; Saura Import &amp;&nbsp; Export Co., by order of August&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1955.<br><br>On&nbsp; November 22,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; alleging mistake, accident or excusable negligence,&nbsp; Saura Import&nbsp; &amp; Export Co., Inc. filed a petition&nbsp; to set aside the&nbsp; entry of default.&nbsp; Prudential Bank opposed the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; calling&nbsp; attention to its&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; untimeliness,&nbsp; because&nbsp; 80 days&nbsp; had already elapsed from the time Saura Import&nbsp; &amp; Export Co., Inc. first&nbsp; learned&nbsp; of the order of default,&nbsp; and&nbsp; denying the truth of&nbsp; such accident, mistake or excusable negligence, etc., etc.<br><br>On December 20,&nbsp; 1955, the respondent Judge Higinio Macadaeg, issued his order cancelling the previous order of default; furthermore, three days later, at the request of&nbsp; Saura Import&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Export&nbsp; Co., Inc.&nbsp; over the&nbsp; Bank's opposition.&nbsp; His Honor&nbsp; decreed&nbsp; the&nbsp; dissolution&nbsp; of the preliminary&nbsp; attachment&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; filing of a&nbsp; suitable counterbond.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This&nbsp; explains the inclusion as respondents of the&nbsp; Davao Sheriff and Register of Deeds:&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bank requests for mandamus to reinstate the attachment.) After its&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; reconsider the&nbsp; orders&nbsp; cancelling the&nbsp; default&nbsp; and&nbsp; the attachment&nbsp; had&nbsp; failed,&nbsp; the Bank instituted this&nbsp; proceeding to&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; the&nbsp; annulment of both&nbsp; orders plus other&nbsp; allied&nbsp; relief.<br><br>At the outset, it may be stated that certain incidents have&nbsp; not been&nbsp; mentioned, they being immaterial to the issues here.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also&nbsp; be&nbsp; stated that, as petitioner's objection to&nbsp; the&nbsp; dissolution&nbsp; rests on the default order which,&nbsp; it avers, should&nbsp; remain undisturbed, this decision will address&nbsp; itself solely&nbsp; to&nbsp; the questions pertinent to the quashing of the default.<br><br>Elementary, of&nbsp; course, is&nbsp; the principle that&nbsp; an order denying plaintiff's&nbsp; petition to declare defendant in default is interlocutory; no appeal lies therefrom.&nbsp; And we have ruled that as no&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; lies, neither&nbsp; will&nbsp; a&nbsp; certiorari petition be entertained to circumvent the principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <br><br>Now, the circumstances before&nbsp; us&nbsp; present practically the&nbsp; same situation.&nbsp; In&nbsp;&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; judge <span style="font-style: italic;">refused to declare</span> defendant&nbsp; in default;&nbsp; yet Prudential Bank brings the matter here for review.<br><br>Nevertheless,&nbsp; petitioner alleges lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; jurisdiction, the petition to set&nbsp; aside&nbsp; having&nbsp; been filed more&nbsp; than sixty days after Saura&nbsp; Import &amp; Export&nbsp; Co., Inc. had come to know the entry&nbsp; of default.&nbsp;&nbsp; "From September 3, 1955" argues petitioner,&nbsp; "the day respondent&nbsp; Saura positively and undeniably learned of the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; default, to November&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; day respondent&nbsp; Saura&nbsp; filed its&nbsp; petition to&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of&nbsp; default&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground of accident, mistake or excusable negligence, there had elapsed a total of&nbsp; 80 days, or&nbsp; 20 days more than the 60-day period allowed by&nbsp; sec.&nbsp; 3 of "Rule 38&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Rules of Court".<br><br>This contention respondent's&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; denies,&nbsp; because in his view, the order of default was merely interlocutory and was subject to the control of&nbsp; the court until&nbsp; final judgment.&nbsp; He quotes from&nbsp; Larrobis <i>vs.</i> Wislisenus,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; the power of the courts, in accordance with immemorial usage, to set aside&nbsp; an&nbsp; interlocutory&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; default,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> such order being&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; control of&nbsp; the court&nbsp; until&nbsp; the final decision of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; "and may be modified or rescinded on&nbsp; sufficient grounds shown&nbsp; at any&nbsp; time before final judgment".<br><br>At this juncture, it may be noted that after the entry of default,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; presented&nbsp; its&nbsp; evidence;&nbsp; but before&nbsp; decision&nbsp; or judgment&nbsp; or default could be entered, defendant asked for rescision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; entry&nbsp; of default; and then the Judge issued&nbsp;&nbsp; the order&nbsp; now&nbsp; in question. The default entry was,&nbsp; therefore, cancelled before rendition of final judgment.<br><br>In several&nbsp; decisions&nbsp;&nbsp; we said one who&nbsp; has defaulted may apply for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court. (Lim&nbsp; Toco <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Go&nbsp; Pay,&nbsp; 80&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 166;&nbsp; Gequillana&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Buenaventura, 48&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; 63.)&nbsp; This,&nbsp; at first glance, seems to require presentation of the petition within the time limits prescribed therein, i. e.,&nbsp; within 60 days after a knowing the default order and within six months&nbsp; after the entry of such order.<br><br>In Gana&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Abaya,&nbsp; 52 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 231,&nbsp; we annulled on&nbsp; certiorari the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; court of first instance cancelling a decree of default, because the petition for relief had&nbsp; been filed more than six&nbsp; months after the issuance of&nbsp; such&nbsp; decree.&nbsp; We&nbsp; regarded&nbsp; the&nbsp; period fixed in Rule 38 to be jurisdictional.&nbsp; And in&nbsp; Isaac&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Mendoza, L-2820,&nbsp; June 2, 1951,&nbsp; applying the&nbsp; ruling in Lim Toco <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Go&nbsp; Pay, supra,&nbsp; we&nbsp; expressed&nbsp; the&nbsp; view that if&nbsp; the petition for relief from a default order is not presented within the six-month period fixed in Rule&nbsp; 38, the court of first instance loses the power to&nbsp; grant it. However, in&nbsp; other decisions, the opinion was&nbsp; expressed that a&nbsp; default order&nbsp; being&nbsp; interlocutory, is&nbsp; subject to the control of the court and may be modified or rescinded at any&nbsp; time before final judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>From these&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; the resultant principle appears to be that an order of default may be set aside&nbsp; at any time before final&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; provided&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for vacating&nbsp; it is made&nbsp; within six&nbsp; months&nbsp; after&nbsp; entry of the order.<br><br>In applying&nbsp; such resultant&nbsp; principle,&nbsp; we find&nbsp; in this litigation that whereas&nbsp; the default&nbsp; entry occurred&nbsp; on August&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; November 22,&nbsp; 1955,—within&nbsp; six months—defendant petitioned for relief.&nbsp; The court had jurisdiction to&nbsp; lift the order of default.<br><br>Granted the court's jurisdiction&nbsp; to vacate, all issues referring to the reason or reasons for vacating&nbsp; do&nbsp; not need elucidation&nbsp; at this time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; To do so would&nbsp; convert certiorari proceedings&nbsp; into a means of "evading the rule against appeals from interlocutory&nbsp; orders6 with&nbsp; the attending evils which the prohibition seeks to avoid.&nbsp; Specifically, this court has declared itself against&nbsp; appeals from orders&nbsp; vacating default judgments.&nbsp; (Smith <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Mijares, 23&nbsp; Phil., 619.)<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; there being no&nbsp; excess of&nbsp; jurisdiction, action favorable to petitioner&nbsp; must&nbsp; be&nbsp; declined.<br><br>As&nbsp; to&nbsp; alleged&nbsp;&nbsp; insufficiency&nbsp; of&nbsp; the counterbond,&nbsp; the matter may&nbsp; be submitted to the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below for&nbsp; consideration.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
