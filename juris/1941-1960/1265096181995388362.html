				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Juan Mendiola was employed  by Francisco Tan Lim  Te as a truck driver in the latter's rice mill located at Angeles, Pampanga.  On January 28,  1952,  while  Mendiola  was sitting atop several sacks of palay loaded in a jeep-trailer belonging to his  employer which, at the  time, was being driven by another Chinaman,  to  prevent  said sacks from falling, the vehicle happened to pass on a roadhole causing Mendiola to be forcibly  thrown to the ground.  A radiography of the  victim taken  on the day of  the  accident revealed  that he sustained the following  injuries: "Dislocation of the patella,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span> </sup>left;  simple fracture pubis, left and right bones with slight overlapping on the right pubis bone". <br><br>Mendiola received medical  treatment from a physician in Angeles, Pampanga,  and,  allegedly against the  advice of the latter, he was brought by his employer to a Chinese masseur in Manila.  A month thereafter he reported back for  work, although  he was said  to have recurring fever ever since.  On January 25, 1953, Mendiola succumbed to his ailment, diagnosed as "portal  cirrhosis",<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> at the North General  Hospital.  The physician in  the aforesaid hospital who last attended him  declared  that "the  first stage  of  Portal Cirrhosis might have been  present  at the time of the injury  and  weakened resistance might have aggravated the  condition".  This  statement appears to be substantiated by the fact that as of 1951, the deceased was already under  treatment for  "biliousness,  chronic hepatitis<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup>  and mild icterus".<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</span></sup> <br><br>On <span style="font-style: italic;">March 3, 1958</span>, the widow and her 7 minor children filed a claim for compensation with the Workmen's Compensation Commission against Francisco Tan Lim Te for the death of Juan Mendiola (Case No. 25537).  But notwithstanding the fact that the Commission had transmitted a copy of the  claim together with W.C.C.  Form No. 3, Employer's Report of Accident and  Sickness, to the  employer for accomplishment  on September 18, 1958,  the latter submitted the aforesaid  report containing his opposition to the  claim of the  heirs of the deceased only on February 10,1954.   On September 7, 1955, the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner, finding that the  injury sustained by the deceased which caused his death arose out of or in the course of his employment, awarded the widow and the 7 minors, all dependent upon said employee,  the sum  of P2,880.80  as compensation,  plus  the  amount  of P200.00 as burial expenses.  The employer thus moved for a reconsideration of the award on the ground that he was not  given opportunity to present evidence although  he opposed the claim; that his failure to controvert said claim at an earlier date  was due to his unfamiliarity with  the law; and  that the claim was likewise filed out of  time and they could, therefore, be considered to be in part delicto. This motion was denied by the Commissioner in his order of February 23, 1956.  The employer again filed a petition, this time  for review and/or  new hearing contending that if he would be allowed  to  present evidence, he would establish that the Commission had no jurisdiction over the case; that the accident was through the fault, negligence and drunkenness of the deceased; and that  the  death  of Mendiola was not caused bjy accident but due to his chronic alcoholism,  which petition was denied on April 18,  1956, for lack of merit. <br><br>On March 29, 1957,  the Secretary of the Workmen's Compensation Commission,  invoking  the provisions  of Article III, paragraph 12 of  the Reorganization Plan No. 20-A,  issued a  writ of execution  ordering the Provincial Sheriff of Pampanga to satisfy, out of the properties of Francisco Tan  Lim Te, the award  in favor of claimants amounting to P2,802.85,  plus  the  sum  of P29 which will go to the Workmen's Compensation  Fund, and the cost of execution thereof.  Pursuant thereto, the Provincial Sheriff placed under distraint certain properties of Tan Lim Te and  set  the  date for the sale thereof at public auction. The  said employer,  questioning its jurisdiction  to  issue an order of execution, filed with the Commission a motion to cancel said  order, but as  the  public sale would  take place on May  11,  1957, he filed the instant petition for certiorari seeking to nullify the  proceeding and the award in W.C. Case No. 26537  without waiting for  the ruling on the aforementioned motion.  And as prayed, this Court issued a writ  of preliminary injunction restraining the Provincial Sheriff  from enforcing the writ  of execution and  proceeding  with the public sale upon petitioner's filing a bond for P200.<br><br>The record  of the  case  supports the Commissioner's finding that  Tan  Lim  Te filed the  Employer's Report of the  accident involving the  deceased Juan  Mendiola  only on February 10,  1954, despite  the  fact that he was informed  thereof on  January 28, 1952, and was furnished copy of the claim for compensation on September 18, 1953. In  this   connection, the  Workmen's  Compensation  Law (Act No. 3428, as amended) provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 44.—<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*     *     *     *    *    *    *<br></div><br>In case the  employer decides to  controvert the right to compensation, he shall,  either  on  or before the fourteenth  day of disability or <span style="font-style: italic;">within ten days after he has knowledge of the alleged accident, </span>file  a notice with the Commissioner, on a form prescribed by him, that compensation is not being paid, giving the name of the claimant, name of the employer, date of the accident and the reason why compensation is not  being paid.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Failure on the part of the employer or the insurance carrier to comply with this requirement shall constitute a renunciation of his right to controvert the claim </span>unless he submits reasonable grounds for the failure to make  the necessary" reports,  on the basis of which grounds  the Commissioner may reinstate his right to controvert the  claim. </blockquote>  <div style="text-align: center;">*    *    *    *    *    *    *<br></div><br>It is clear from the foregoing that in the event of an  accident which causes death or injury to an employee, the  employer's right to  contest  or controvert any claim for compensation arises  immediately upon  the occurrence of such accident.  But for an employer to invoke such right, the law requires him to  submit a  report of  the  accident within  14  days from the date of disability  or within 10 days after he  acquires knowledge  thereof; otherwise, he shall be considered to have waived the right to  question  the validity  or reasonableness of the injured employee's  claim for compensation.   An exception to this rule may  be obtained where the employer's failure to comply with such requirement is  justified or explained to  the  satisfaction of  the  Commissioner,  who, in  the exercise of his discretion,  may allow the former to controvert or resist the claim.   And as  such  power involves the  use of discretion, this  Court is prone not to disturb the same  unless the exercise  thereof is gravely abused.  In  the  case at bar, we find that the Commissioner  committed no  grave abuse  of  discretion  in  awarding  compensation to the claimants and  in denying petitioner's  motions to  reconsider the same;  hence, there exist no  reason why said award  should  be  altered or  disturbed. <br><br>Petitioner, likewise, contests the power of the Workmen's Compensation  Commission to issue a writ of  execution directing the Provincial Sheriff to execute the  disputed award, asserting that such an award may only be enforced by  filing in  any court of record of the place where the accident occurred a  certified copy of  the decision  from which  no petition for review or appeal has  been  taken within the time  allowed  therefor;  whereupon, the  Court shall render a decree or judgment in accordance therewith and notify the parties accordingly (Sec. 51, Act No. 3428, as amended by Rep. Act No. 772).  Respondents, however, contend that Rule 11 of the Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission promulgated pursuant to paragraph 12, Article  III of the  Reorganization  Plan No.  20—A, as implemented by Executive Order No.  218,  authorizes the Commission to issue a writ of execution.  While it is true that Rule  11 of the aforesaid Rules  provides  that: <br><blockquote> "RULE 11. EXECUTION OF DECISIONS, ORDERS, OR AWARDS.<br><br>SECTION  1. As soon as  a decision,  order  or award  has become final and executory, the  Regional  Administrator or Commission, as the case may be, shall, <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> or on motion of the interested party, issue a  writ of execution requiring  the sheriff or other  proper officer to whom it is directed to execute said decision, order  or award, pursuant  to Rule 39 of the Rules of Court of the Philippines.",</blockquote>yet said rules, which were published in the April 15, 1957 issue  of the Official Gazette, <span style="font-style: italic;">became effective only on April 30, 1957</span>, or 15 days after their publication (Vol. 53, No. 7, Off. Gaz. p. 2112).   Considering that the writ of execution was issued by the Commission on <span style="font-style: italic;">March 29, 1957</span>, or a month and two days before the effectivity of said rules, there is no doubt that the execution of the award; should be governed by the provisions of Rule 51 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  Nevertheless, this fact cannot in any way affect the validity of the award, for it having become final,  it becomes merely the court's   (or  commission's) ministerial  duty to issue a  writ of  execution, and  certainly,  an erroneous or voided writ cannot  work to divest said final order or judgment  of its character of finality. Moreover, an erroneous or voided  writ of execution  will not preclude the  issuance of another writ to  carry out and satisfy a judgment or award, for the prevailing party who  is entitled  to  such  writ  of execution shall  not be prejudiced by the mistake or erroar of the court or  body issuing the  same. <br><br>Wherefore, the petition for  certiorari  now under consideration  is dismissed and the writ  of preliminary injunction  issued  herein  is  hereby  lifted.   However, the Workmen's Compensation Commission shall issue another writ of execution with which to substitute the one issued before  the Rules  of that  Commission  became  effective. With costs against petitioner.  It is so ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J.,  Bengzon,  Montemayor,  Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
