				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from&nbsp; a decision of the Court of Tax Appeals sustaining&nbsp; the validity of a&nbsp; tax amounting to&nbsp; P7,614.60 against the estate&nbsp; of Olimpio Fernandez under the War Profits Tax Law (Republic Act No.&nbsp; 55).<p>Olimpio&nbsp; Fernandez and his wife&nbsp; Angelina&nbsp; Oasan had a net worth&nbsp; of P8,600 on December&nbsp; 8, 1941.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Japanese occupation the spouses acquired several real&nbsp; properties, and at the time of his death&nbsp; on February 11, 1945 he had a net worth of P31,489.&nbsp; The Collector of Internal Revenue assessed a war profits tax&nbsp; on the estate of the deceased at&nbsp; P7,614.60,&nbsp; which his administratirx refused to pay.&nbsp; The case&nbsp; was brought to the Court of Tax Appeals which sustained the validity and legality of the assessment.&nbsp; The administratrix has appealed this decision to, this Court.</p><p>The most&nbsp; important&nbsp; questions raised by the&nbsp; appellant are:&nbsp; (<em>a</em>) the unconstitutionally&nbsp; of the war&nbsp; profits tax law&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason that it is retroactive; (<em>b</em>) the&nbsp; inapplicability of said law to the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; of the deceased Olimpio&nbsp; Fernandez,&nbsp; because the&nbsp; law&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; individuals; and (<em>c</em>) the separate&nbsp; taxation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of the deceased Olimpio&nbsp; Fernandez from that of his wife's, because Olimpio Fernandez died before the law was passed.</p><p>Appellant's contention that the law is invalid or unconstitutional because&nbsp; it acts retroactively, thus violating the due&nbsp; process of law clause, is not&nbsp; supported by reason or authority.&nbsp; The&nbsp; tax, insofar as applicable to the estate of the&nbsp; deceased Olimpio&nbsp; Fernandez,&nbsp; is both a&nbsp; property tax and a&nbsp; tax on&nbsp; income.&nbsp; It is a property tax&nbsp; in&nbsp; relation to the properties that Fernandez had in&nbsp; December, 1941; and it is an income tax in relation to the properties which he&nbsp; purchased during&nbsp; the Japanese&nbsp; occupation.&nbsp; In&nbsp; both cases, however, the war profits tax may not be considered as unconstitutional.</p><p>The doctrine of unconstitutionally raised by appellant is based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; against <em>ex&nbsp; post facto</em> laws. But this prohibition&nbsp; applies&nbsp; only&nbsp; to&nbsp; criminal or penal matters, and not to laws which concern civil&nbsp; matters or proceedings generally, or which affect or&nbsp; regulate&nbsp; civil or private&nbsp; rights (Ex parte Garland, 18 Law Ed.,&nbsp; 366; 16 C. J. S., 889-891).&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"At an early day it was settled by&nbsp; authoritative&nbsp; decisions, in opposition to what might&nbsp; seem the more natural and obvious meaning of&nbsp; the&nbsp; term&nbsp; ex post facto, that in their&nbsp; scope&nbsp; and&nbsp; purpose these provisions were confined, to laws&nbsp; respecting criminal punishments,&nbsp; and had no relation whatever&nbsp; to retrospective legislation of any other description.&nbsp; And it has,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; been repeatedly held, that retrospective laws, when not of a criminal nature, do not come in conflict with the&nbsp; national&nbsp; Constitution,&nbsp; unless&nbsp; obnoxious to its provisions on other grounds&nbsp; than their respective character."&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&nbsp; Cooley,&nbsp; Constitutional Limitations, 544-545.)</p></blockquote><p>We&nbsp; have applied the above principle in the&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of Mekin&nbsp; <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Wolf, 2&nbsp; Phil. 74 and&nbsp; Ongsiako&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Gamboa,&nbsp; 47 Off.&nbsp; Gaz,,&nbsp; No. 11, 5613, 5616.</p><p>It has also been held that property taxes and&nbsp; benefit assessments on real estate, retroactively&nbsp; applied,&nbsp; are not open to the objection that they infringe upon the due process&nbsp; of law clause of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution (Wagner <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Baltimore, 239 U.&nbsp; S. 207, 60 L.&nbsp; Ed. 230); that taxes on income are not&nbsp; subject to the constitutional objection because of their retroactivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; universal&nbsp; practice has&nbsp; been to increase taxes&nbsp; on incomes already earned; yet notwithstanding&nbsp; this retroactive operation,&nbsp; income&nbsp; taxes have not&nbsp; been successfully&nbsp; assailed&nbsp; as&nbsp; invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; uniform ruling of the courts in the United&nbsp; States has been to reject&nbsp; the&nbsp; contention that&nbsp; the retroactive&nbsp; application&nbsp; of revenue acts is a denial of the due process guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment (Welch&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Henry,&nbsp; 305 U. S, 134, 83 L. Ed. 87).</p><p>It has also been held that in order to declare a tax as transgressing the&nbsp; constitutional limitation, it must be so harsh and oppressive in its retroactive application (Idem.) But we hold that far from being unjust or harsh and oppressive our war profits tax is both wise and just The last Pacific war and the Japanese occupation of the Islands have&nbsp; wrought divergent effects upon the different sectors of the population The quiet&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; timid, who were afraid to go out of their homes or who refused&nbsp; to have any dealings with the enemy, stopped from exercising their callings or professions, losing their incomes; and. they&nbsp; supported&nbsp; themselves&nbsp; with properties&nbsp; they already owned,&nbsp; selling these from time to&nbsp; time&nbsp; to raise&nbsp; funds with&nbsp; which&nbsp; to purchase&nbsp; their daily needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; These were reduced&nbsp; to penury&nbsp; and&nbsp; want&nbsp; But the bold&nbsp; and&nbsp; the daring,&nbsp; as well as those who were callous to the criticism of being collaborators, engaged in trading in all forms or sorts of commodities, from&nbsp; foodstuffs&nbsp; to&nbsp; war materials, earning fabulous incomes&nbsp; and acquiring properties with their earnings.&nbsp; Those who were able to retain their properties found themselves possessed of increased wealth because inflation set in, the&nbsp; currency&nbsp; dropped in value and properties&nbsp; soared in prices.&nbsp; It would&nbsp; have been unrealistic for the legislature to have ignored all these facts and circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the&nbsp; war it could not, with&nbsp; justice to all concerned, apportion&nbsp; the expenses&nbsp; of government equally&nbsp; on all the people irrespective of the vicissitudes of war, equally on those who had&nbsp; their properties decimated as on those who had become fabulously rich after the war.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who were fortunate to increase their wealth&nbsp; during the&nbsp; troubulous period&nbsp; of&nbsp; the war were made to&nbsp; contribute&nbsp; a portion of&nbsp; their&nbsp; newly-acquired wealth for the maintenance of the government and defray its&nbsp; expenses.&nbsp; Those who in turn were reduced to penury or whose incomes suffered reductions could not be compelled to share&nbsp; in&nbsp; the expenses&nbsp; to the same extent as those who grew rich.&nbsp;&nbsp; This in effect is what the legislature did when it enacted the War Profits Tax Law,&nbsp;&nbsp; The law may not be&nbsp; considered harsh and oppressive because the force of its impact fell on&nbsp; those&nbsp; who had amassed wealth or increased their wealth during the war, but did not touch the&nbsp; less fortunate,&nbsp;&nbsp; The policy followed is the same as that which underlies the Income&nbsp; Tax&nbsp; Law, imposing the&nbsp; burden&nbsp; upon those who have and&nbsp; relieving those who have&nbsp; not.&nbsp; No one can dare&nbsp; challenge the law as harsh and&nbsp; oppressive.&nbsp; We declare it to be just and sound and overrule the&nbsp; objection thereto on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground of unconstitutionality.</p><p>The contention that the deceased Olimpio Fernandez or his estate&nbsp; should not&nbsp; be responsible because&nbsp; he died in 1945&nbsp; and was no longer living when the law was enacted at a later date, in 1946, is absolutely without merit&nbsp; Fernandez&nbsp; died immediately before&nbsp; the&nbsp; liberation and the actual cessation&nbsp; of&nbsp; hostilities. He profited by&nbsp; the&nbsp; war; there is&nbsp; no reason why the incident of his death should relieve his estate from the tax.&nbsp; On this matter&nbsp; we agree with the Court of Tax Appeals that the provisions of section 18 of the Internal Revenue Code have been incorporated in Republic Act No. 55 by virtue of Section 9 thereof, which provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Sec. 9.&nbsp; <em>Administrative remedies</em>.â€”All administrative, special and general provisions&nbsp; of law, including the&nbsp; laws in relation to&nbsp; the assessment, remission,&nbsp; collection and&nbsp; refund&nbsp; of national&nbsp; internal revenue taxes, not&nbsp; inconsistent with the provisions of the&nbsp; Act, are hereby extended and made applicable to all the provisions of this law, and to the tax herein imposed."</p></blockquote><p>Under section&nbsp; 84 of the National Internal Revenue Code, the term "person"&nbsp; means an individual, a trust,&nbsp; estate, corporation, or&nbsp; a&nbsp; duly registered general co-parnership. If the individual is already dead, property or estate left by him should be subject to the&nbsp; tax in&nbsp; the same manner as if he were&nbsp; alive.</p><p>The last contention is also without merit.&nbsp; The property which Olimpio Fernandez&nbsp; was&nbsp; possessed of&nbsp; in December 1941 is presumed to be conjugal property and so are&nbsp; the&nbsp; properties which were acquired&nbsp; by&nbsp; him&nbsp; during the&nbsp; war, because at that&nbsp; time he was married.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no claim or&nbsp; evidence to&nbsp; support the claim that any of the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; were paraphernal&nbsp; properties&nbsp; of the. wife; so the presumption stands&nbsp; that they were conjugal properties of&nbsp; the&nbsp; husband&nbsp; and&nbsp; wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; these&nbsp; circumstances they cannot be considered&nbsp; as properties belonging&nbsp; to two individuals, each of which shall be subject to the tax independently of the other.</p><p>For the foregoing considerations, the judgment appealed from is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with costs against the appellants.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L., Endencia,</em>&nbsp; and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
