				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an action to recover&nbsp; one-half&nbsp; (1/2) of a parcel of land&nbsp; containing&nbsp; an area of 156&nbsp; hectares situated in San Juan, Batangas, plus the value of the produce gathered thereon from August, 1947&nbsp; until actual&nbsp; recovery&nbsp; and in the alternative, to recover the sum of P47,000 representing reimbursement of&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of useful and&nbsp; necessary expenses incurred to clear and improve the aforesaid&nbsp; land.<br><br>Plaintiff is the judicial&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; the estate of the late&nbsp; Santiago Babao while defendant Florencio Perez is the judicial&nbsp; administrator of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of the&nbsp; late Celestina Perez.&nbsp; The other defendants are purchasers and actual owners&nbsp; of portions&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; which&nbsp; is&nbsp; sought to be recovered in&nbsp; the present litigation.<br><br>The complaint alleges that Celestina Perez was in her lifetime the owner of the parcel of land in question which was not registered either&nbsp; under Act 496 or&nbsp; under the Spanish&nbsp; Mortgage Law; that sometime in 1924 when the deceased&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Babao&nbsp; married Maria&nbsp; Cleofe&nbsp; Perez, niece of&nbsp; Celestina Perez, the latter and the former entered into a verbal agreement whereby Santiago&nbsp; Babao bound himself to improve the land by levelling and clearing all the forest trees standing thereon and planting in lieu thereof coconuts,&nbsp; rice, corn and&nbsp; other crops&nbsp; such as bananas and&nbsp; bamboo trees,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; act&nbsp; at the same time as administrator thereof during the lifetime of Celestina Perez, all&nbsp; expenses for labor and&nbsp; materials&nbsp; to be&nbsp; at his&nbsp; cost, in consideration&nbsp; of which Celestina in turn bound&nbsp; herself to convey to Santiago Babao or his&nbsp; wife 1/2 of the&nbsp; land, together with&nbsp; all&nbsp; the improvements&nbsp; thereon&nbsp; upon her death; that pursuant&nbsp; to said verbal&nbsp; agreement, Santiago Babao in 1924 left his job as administrator of&nbsp; the Liana Estate in San Juan, Batangas for which he was receiving a salary of P150 a&nbsp; month,&nbsp; and started levelling and clearing the land having planted in an area of 50 hectares&nbsp; 5,000 coconuts trees, and&nbsp; rice and corn in another area of 70 hectares,&nbsp; leaving out only about 50 hectares unimproved, all of which having been administered by him from 1924 to 1946; that for clearing and improving the portions of land above-mentioned, he incurred expenses amounting to P7,400 which added to his salary as administrator&nbsp; from 1924 to 1946&nbsp; at the rate of P150&nbsp; a&nbsp; month amounting to P39,600, makes a total of P47,000; that in violation of the aforesaid verbal agreement, Celestina&nbsp; Perez, acting through. Leovigildo Perez,&nbsp; to whom she extended&nbsp; a power of&nbsp; attorney to sell, sold few days before she died about 1271/2 hectares of 'the land in question in consequence of which Santiago&nbsp; Babao was deprived of the possession and administration&nbsp; thereof from 1945;&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; sales&nbsp; were fictitious&nbsp; and were made in clear violation&nbsp; of the oral agreement made between Celestina&nbsp; Perez&nbsp; and Santiago Babao and as such the same are null and&nbsp; void; that Celestina Perez died on August 24, 1947 as a result of which intestate proceedings were instituted&nbsp; for the settlement of her estate and one Florencio Perez was named as judicial administrator; that Santiago Babao&nbsp; died&nbsp; on January 6, 1948 and as a consequence intestate&nbsp; proceedings were&nbsp; instituted for the settlement of&nbsp; his&nbsp; estate and Bienvenido Babao&nbsp; was appointed judicial administrator; and that in the event the estate of Santiago&nbsp; Babao failed to recover the 1/2&nbsp; portion of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land herein litigated,&nbsp; said&nbsp; estate would&nbsp; suffer an&nbsp; irreparable damage of&nbsp; not less&nbsp; than P366.700 representing fruits which it has failed to receive during the last 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore, plaintiff prayed for the conveyance of 1/2 portion of the land in question and for annulment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sales of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; portion&nbsp; thereof for having been&nbsp; made&nbsp; fictitiously, and in the alternative, for judgment in plaintiff's favor for the&nbsp; sum of P47,000 representing the amount of&nbsp; useful and necessary expenses incurred by Santiago Babao in improving the land in line with the oral agreement.<br><br>Defendants denied plaintiff's claim that a verbal agreement was&nbsp; entered into&nbsp;&nbsp; between Celestina&nbsp; Perez and Santiago Babao relative&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; clearing,&nbsp; improving&nbsp; and administering the land&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; former&nbsp; having an&nbsp; area of&nbsp; 156&nbsp; hectares, as&nbsp; well as the other claim that Santiago Babao&nbsp; had&nbsp; actually&nbsp; cleared and improved a great portion thereof&nbsp; at a cost of&nbsp; around P7,400.&nbsp; They&nbsp; alleged that in 1924 and&nbsp; for many&nbsp; years&nbsp; prior thereto, the land in question&nbsp; had already been&nbsp; cleared and cultivated for agricultural purposes with an exception of a portion of 50 hectares; that said land was cleared and cultivated due partly to the effort made by Celestina's&nbsp; husband, Esteban de&nbsp; Villa,&nbsp; her overseers&nbsp; and tenants,&nbsp; and partly&nbsp; to&nbsp; the "trusco" system employed by them whereby persons were allowed to clear the&nbsp; land and plant thereon and from the . harvest were compensated according to&nbsp; a&nbsp; graduated scale of division&nbsp; varying&nbsp; from year to year; that the&nbsp; coconut trees, banana plants&nbsp; and&nbsp; bamboo trees now standing thereon were planted not&nbsp; by Santiago Babao nor at his expense but by the&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; of the spouses Esteban de&nbsp; Villa&nbsp; and Celestina Perez&nbsp; who were duly compensated according to the "trusco" system; that although Santiago Babao&nbsp; and Maria Cleofe Perez were married in 1924,&nbsp; the former did not have anything to&nbsp; do with the land in question&nbsp; for Esteban de Villa was then still living and actively managed the same with the help of his&nbsp; overseer&nbsp; and tenants until he died in 1930; that it&nbsp; was only in. that year when Santiago&nbsp; Babao began administering the land&nbsp; in the capacity of a nephew of&nbsp; Celestina until 1935 when Celestina,&nbsp; disgusted with the conduct of Santiago, left the company of Santiago&nbsp; and&nbsp; his wife&nbsp; and&nbsp; went to live with her nephew Bernardo Perez&nbsp; until her death in 1947;&nbsp; that since then Celestina Perez prohibited Santiago from interfering with the administration&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; and&nbsp; designated another person in&nbsp; his place,&nbsp; and for the work he&nbsp; did from 1930 to 1935, he&nbsp; was more than compensated because the proceeds&nbsp; of the harvests&nbsp; during&nbsp; said years&nbsp; were all&nbsp; given to him and&nbsp; his&nbsp; wife and Celestina was given only what was barely&nbsp; sufficient for her maintenance.<br><br>Defendants also alleged that the sales mads by Celestina Perez through her attorney-in-fact&nbsp; Leovigildo Perez of several portions of&nbsp; the land were not fictitious as alleged but&nbsp; were made&nbsp; with&nbsp; full&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; and&nbsp; authority of Celestina who executed in favor of&nbsp; Leovigildo&nbsp; Perez a power of attorney under the&nbsp; authority of a notary public in the&nbsp; presence of&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Babao himself&nbsp; who did not interpose any objection to the execution of said power of attorney&nbsp; and,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; said&nbsp; sales&nbsp; are&nbsp; real,&nbsp; valid&nbsp; and genuine,&nbsp; having&nbsp; been executed in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; law. Defendants&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that the complaint be dismissed with costs, after&nbsp; awarding to&nbsp; them&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages' in the amount that the court may deem proper&nbsp; to&nbsp; fix.<br><br>After hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court rendered judgment&nbsp; the&nbsp; dispositive part&nbsp; of&nbsp; which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHERFORE, judgment&nbsp; is rendered in favor of the&nbsp; plaintiff and against the defendants,<br><blockquote>(1) Declaring&nbsp; the sales of <i>Lupang&nbsp; Parang</i>&nbsp; by and between the defendants, fraudulent and fictitious, null and void;<br>(2) Ordering: defendant Florencio Perez as&nbsp; administrator of the testate estate&nbsp; of the deceased&nbsp; Celestina Perez, to pay plaintiff the sum&nbsp; of P3,786.66 annually from August 25, 1947 until delivery&nbsp; of the land to the latter, with interest thereon at&nbsp; the rate of 6 per cent&nbsp; per annum from the date of the&nbsp; filing of the complaint;<br>(3) Divesting the title of defendants over 1/2&nbsp; of <i>Lupang Parang</i> both&nbsp; in quantity and quality and vesting title thereover in plaintiff pursuant to&nbsp; section&nbsp; 10 of Rule&nbsp; 39.&nbsp; To carry out&nbsp; this judgment, the Clerk of Court is hereby appointed representative of this Court to designate a disinterested surveyor for the necessary survey and division, the expenses&nbsp; therefor to be defrayed&nbsp; half&nbsp; and half by plaintiff and Floreneio Peres;<br>(4) Ordering defendants to&nbsp; surrender the possession of the half adjudicated and vested in favor of the plaintiff after the&nbsp; same has been designated under&nbsp; the&nbsp; proceeding&nbsp; paragraph; and<br>(5) To pay the costs."</blockquote></blockquote>Defendants in&nbsp; due&nbsp; time took the&nbsp; case on appeal to the Court&nbsp; of Appeals&nbsp; where the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; their respective&nbsp; briefs&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; reglementary&nbsp;&nbsp; period,&nbsp; and thereafter the court rendered judgment reversing <i>in toto</i> the&nbsp; decision appealed from and dismissing the case without&nbsp; pronouncement as&nbsp; to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; But when&nbsp; its&nbsp; attention was called, thru a&nbsp; proper motion, that&nbsp; that&nbsp; court&nbsp; acted without jurisdiction because the amount involved was more than P50,000, the court in&nbsp; a resolution entered on August 14, 1954 set aside its decision and forwarded the case to us&nbsp; to&nbsp; have the case&nbsp; remanded&nbsp; to the Court&nbsp; of Appeals proved futile.<br><br>While this case was pending in the lower court, counsel for appellants filed a motion to&nbsp; dismiss on the&nbsp; ground, among others, that the alleged verbal agreement between Santiago&nbsp; Babao&nbsp; and&nbsp; Celestina&nbsp; Perez&nbsp; was&nbsp; unenforceable under&nbsp; the&nbsp; Statute of&nbsp; Frauds.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court denied this motion on the ground that it&nbsp; appears from the complaint "that&nbsp; Santiago fully&nbsp; complied with&nbsp; his&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the oral contract between the parties&nbsp; and that this is an action not only for specific&nbsp; performance but also&nbsp; for damages." Consequently,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court held&nbsp; that the Statute of Frauds cannot be invoked&nbsp; for&nbsp; the reason that&nbsp; "performance&nbsp; by one party of his&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; contract takes the&nbsp; case&nbsp; out of the statute."&nbsp; And pursuant to such&nbsp; ruling, when&nbsp; the case was tried on the merits, the&nbsp; court&nbsp; overruled all&nbsp; objections&nbsp; of counsel for appellants to the introduction&nbsp; of&nbsp; oral testimony to prove the alleged&nbsp; verbal agreement. The important question then to be determined is whether or&nbsp; not the alleged verbal agreement falls within the prohibition&nbsp; of the Statute of&nbsp; Frauds.<br><br>This statute, formerly incorporated as Section 21 of Rule 123 of our Rules of Court, is now found in Article 1403 of the new Civil Code, which provides, in so&nbsp; far as pertinent to this&nbsp; case, as follows:<br><blockquote>"In&nbsp; the following eases&nbsp; an&nbsp; agreement hereafter made shall be unenforceable by action&nbsp; unless tile same,&nbsp; or some note&nbsp; or&nbsp; memorandum thereof, be&nbsp; in writing, and subscribed by the party charged, or by&nbsp; his agent, evidence&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; of. the agreement&nbsp; cannot be received without&nbsp; the writing, or secondary&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; its contents;<br><blockquote>"(a)&nbsp; An&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; that by its terms&nbsp; is not to be&nbsp; performed within a year from the making thereof.<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br><br></center>"(e)&nbsp; An agreement * * * for the sale of real property or of an interest therein."</blockquote></blockquote>Appellants contend that the alleged verbal agreement falls under paragraphs&nbsp; (a) and (e) above-quoted because the same may be considered as an agreement which by its terms, is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof,&nbsp; or one&nbsp; which&nbsp; involves a&nbsp; sale&nbsp; of&nbsp; real property or&nbsp; of an interest&nbsp; therein.&nbsp; If&nbsp; this&nbsp; premise is correct, appellants&nbsp; contend, then the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of parole&nbsp; evidence to prove the alleged agreement over the vigorous objection of counsel for appellants.<br><br>That&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged verbal agreement is one&nbsp; which by its terms is not to&nbsp; be&nbsp; performed within one year is&nbsp; very apparent from&nbsp; the allegations&nbsp; of&nbsp; the complaint. Thus, it is therein alleged that&nbsp; the agreement&nbsp; was&nbsp; allegedly made in 1924 and by its terms Santiago&nbsp; Babao bound himself&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; to improve&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; 156 hectares of forest lands by levelling&nbsp; and clearing&nbsp; all the forest trees and planting thereon&nbsp; coconuts,&nbsp; rice, corn&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; crops such as&nbsp; bananas and bamboo trees,&nbsp; and (2)&nbsp; to act at the same time as administrator of said land&nbsp; and improvements during the&nbsp; lifetime of&nbsp; Celestina Perez.&nbsp; And in consideration of such undertaking-,&nbsp; Celestina&nbsp; Perez "bound herself&nbsp; to&nbsp; give and deliver,&nbsp; either&nbsp; to Santiago Babao or his wife Cleofe Perez, one-half&nbsp; (1/2) of the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; area of said land&nbsp; as improved with all the improvements thereon "<i>upon her death</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is also alleged in the complaint that&nbsp; Celestina&nbsp; Perez&nbsp; died on August 24,&nbsp; 1947, or&nbsp; 23 years after the making of the alleged&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; while Santiago&nbsp; Babao died&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; From the above terms, therefore, it is&nbsp; not&nbsp; difficult to&nbsp; see that the undertaking assumed&nbsp; by Santiago&nbsp; Babao which was to clear, level and plant to coconut trees and other plants 156 hectares of forest&nbsp; land could not be accomplished in one year.&nbsp; In fact, the alleged improvements were supposedly accomplished during the lifetime of&nbsp; Celestina, which lasted over a period&nbsp; of&nbsp; 28&nbsp; years,&nbsp; and even then not all&nbsp; was cleared and&nbsp; planted but only a portion thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another part&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; undertaking is that he is to administer the land&nbsp; during the&nbsp; lifetime of&nbsp; Celestina, and&nbsp; as we&nbsp; have already said, her&nbsp; death occurred 23 years after the agreement.<br><br>But the trial court expressed the view that the statute does riot&nbsp; apply because it&nbsp; assumed that Santiago&nbsp; Babao <i>fully&nbsp; complied</i> with his&nbsp; part of the oral contract between the parties,&nbsp; and in its opinion "performance by one party of his part of the contract takes the case out of the statute." Even if this assumption were&nbsp; correct, still&nbsp; we find&nbsp; one flaw&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; logic&nbsp; which&nbsp; fully&nbsp; nullifies it for it fails to consider that in order that a partial&nbsp; performance&nbsp; of the contract may take the case out of the operation of the statute,&nbsp; it must&nbsp; appear&nbsp; clear that&nbsp; the full&nbsp; performance has been made by one&nbsp; party within&nbsp; one&nbsp; year,&nbsp; as&nbsp; otherwise the statute would apply.&nbsp; Thus, the rule on this point is well stated&nbsp; in Corpus&nbsp; Juris in the&nbsp; following&nbsp; wise:&nbsp; "Contracts which&nbsp; by their terms are not to be performed within one year, may be taken out of the statute through performance by one party&nbsp; thereto.&nbsp; <i>All&nbsp; that&nbsp; is required in such case is complete performance within the year by one party</i>, however many years may have to elapse before the&nbsp; agreement is performed by the other party.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>But nothing less&nbsp; than full performance by one party will suffice</i>, and it has been held that, if anything remains to be done after the expiration of the&nbsp; year besides the mere payment of money, the statute will apply."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> (Italics supplied).&nbsp; It- is not therefore correct to&nbsp; state that&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Babao has fully&nbsp; complied&nbsp; with&nbsp; his&nbsp; part&nbsp; within&nbsp; the year&nbsp; from the alleged contract in question.<br><blockquote>"When, in&nbsp; an oral contract&nbsp; which, by its terms,&nbsp; is not to be performed&nbsp; within&nbsp; one year from the execution thereof, one&nbsp; of the contracting: parties has complied&nbsp; within the year with the obligations imposed on him by said contract, the other&nbsp; party cannot avoid the fulfillment&nbsp; of those incumbent on him under the same&nbsp; contract by invoking&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; of frauds because the latter&nbsp; aims to&nbsp; prevent and not&nbsp; to protect fraud."&nbsp; (Shoemaker&nbsp; vs. La Tondeña,&nbsp; Inc. 68 Phil.,&nbsp; 2A.)<br><br>"The&nbsp; broad view is that the statute of Frauds applies&nbsp; only to agreements not&nbsp; to be performed on either side within a year from the making thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agreements to&nbsp; be&nbsp; fully performed&nbsp; on one side within the&nbsp; year are taken out of the&nbsp; operation of the statute." (National Bank vs. Philippine Vegetable Oil Co.,&nbsp; 49 Phil, 857, 858.)</blockquote>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the agreement&nbsp; in question falls also under paragraph&nbsp; (a) of Article 1403&nbsp; of the new Civil Code, i. e., it is a contract or&nbsp; agreement for the sale&nbsp; of real property or of an interest therein, it cannot&nbsp; also be contended&nbsp; that that provision does&nbsp; not apply to the present case&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; was part performance on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this&nbsp; connection, it must the noted that this statute is one based on&nbsp; equity. It is&nbsp; based&nbsp; on equitable&nbsp; estoppel or&nbsp; estoppel&nbsp; by conduct. It operates only&nbsp; under&nbsp; certain&nbsp; specified conditions and when adequate relief at law is&nbsp; unavailable&nbsp; (49 Am.&nbsp; Jur., Statute of Frauds,&nbsp; Section 422, p. 727).&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the requisites that need be present is that the agreement relied on must be certain, definite,&nbsp; clear,&nbsp; unambiguous and unequivocal&nbsp; in&nbsp; its terms before&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; may operate. Thus, the rule on&nbsp; this matter is&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"The contract must be fully made and completed in every respect except for&nbsp; the writing required by the statute,&nbsp; in order to be enforceable on the ground of part&nbsp; performance. The&nbsp; parol agreement relied on must&nbsp; be&nbsp; certain,&nbsp; definite, clear,&nbsp; unambiguous, and unequivocal in its&nbsp; terms, particularly where&nbsp; the agreement is between parent and child, and be&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; established by&nbsp; the evidence.&nbsp; The requisite of&nbsp; clearness&nbsp; and definiteness extends to both the&nbsp; terms and the&nbsp; subject matter&nbsp; of the&nbsp; contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the oral contract must&nbsp; be&nbsp; fair, reasonable, and just in&nbsp; its provisions for equity to enforce it on the ground&nbsp; of part performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it would be inequitable to enforce the&nbsp; oral agreement, or if its&nbsp; specific enforcement&nbsp; would be harsh, or&nbsp; oppressive upon the defendant, equity will withhold&nbsp; its aid. Clearly, the doctrine of&nbsp; part performance taking an oral&nbsp; contract out of the statute of&nbsp; frauds does not apply so as to support&nbsp; a&nbsp; suit for&nbsp; specific, performance where both the&nbsp; equities and the statute support the defendant's&nbsp; case." (49 Am. Jur.,&nbsp; p. 729.)</blockquote>The alleged agreement is far from complying with the above requirement for,&nbsp; according to the complaint, Santiago Babao bound himself to convert a&nbsp; big parcel&nbsp; of forest land of 156 hectares into a veritable farm planted to coconuts, rice,&nbsp; corn and other crops such&nbsp; as bananas and bamboo trees and to act as administrator of said farm during the&nbsp; lifetime of Celestina Perez;, while the latter in turn bound herself to give either to Santiago or his wife 1/2&nbsp; of the land as improved&nbsp; with all the&nbsp; improvements thereon <i>upon her death</i>.&nbsp; This agreement is indeed&nbsp; vague and ambiguous for it does not specify how&nbsp; many hectares was&nbsp; to be&nbsp; planted&nbsp; to&nbsp; coconuts, how many to rice and corn,&nbsp; and what portion to bananas and bamboo trees.&nbsp; And as counsel for appellants puts it, "as the alleged contract stands,&nbsp; if Santiago Babao should&nbsp; plant one-half hectares to coconuts, one-half to&nbsp; rice, and another half hectare&nbsp; to corn,&nbsp; and the rest to bananas&nbsp; and bamboo trees, he&nbsp; would be entitled to receive one-half of 156 hectares, or&nbsp; 78 hectares, of land for his&nbsp; services.&nbsp; That certainly would&nbsp; be unfair and unheard of;&nbsp; no&nbsp; sane&nbsp; property&nbsp; owner&nbsp; would enter into such contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; It costs much more time, money, and labor to plant coconut trees than to plant bananas and bamboo trees; and it also costs less to convert forest land to rice&nbsp; and corn land than to convert&nbsp; it into a&nbsp; coconut plantation.&nbsp; On the part of Celestina&nbsp; Perez, her promise is also incapable of execution.&nbsp; How&nbsp; could&nbsp; she give and deliver one-half of the&nbsp; land upon&nbsp; her death?" <br><br>The terms of the alleged contract would&nbsp; appear more vague if we consider the testimony of Carlos Orense who claimed to have been present at the time the alleged agreement&nbsp; was made&nbsp; between&nbsp; Celestina Perez&nbsp; and Santiago Babao for apparently&nbsp; the same does&nbsp; not&nbsp; run along the same&nbsp; line as the one claimed by appellee.&nbsp; This is what Orense said: "You,&nbsp; Santiago, leave&nbsp; the&nbsp; Liana estate and attend to this <i>lupang parang</i>.&nbsp; Have it cleared and planted to coconuts, for&nbsp; that&nbsp; land will&nbsp; eventually&nbsp; fall&nbsp; in your hands" (as translated from Tagalog),&nbsp; which runs counter with the&nbsp; claim of&nbsp; appellee.&nbsp; The agreement&nbsp; being&nbsp; vague and ambiguous, the&nbsp; doctrine of part&nbsp; performance cannot therefore be Invoked to take this case out of the operation of the statute,<br><blockquote>"Obviously, there can bo&nbsp; no part performance&nbsp; until there is&nbsp; a definite and complete,&nbsp; agreement between&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; In order to warrant&nbsp; the specific enforcement of a parol&nbsp; contract for the sale 6% land, on the ground of part performance, all the essential terms of the&nbsp; contract must be established by competent proof, and shown to be definite, certain, clear, and unambiguous.<br><br>"And this&nbsp; clearness&nbsp; and&nbsp; deiiniteness&nbsp; must&nbsp; extend&nbsp; to&nbsp; both the terms&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject-matter&nbsp; of the contract.<br><br>"The rule that a court will&nbsp; not&nbsp; specifically&nbsp; enforce&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract for the sale&nbsp; of land&nbsp; unless its terms have been&nbsp; definitely understood&nbsp; and&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; upon by&nbsp; the parties,&nbsp; and established&nbsp; by the evidence, is especially applicable to&nbsp; oral contracts sought to be en- forced&nbsp; on the ground of part performance.&nbsp; An oral contract, to be enforced on&nbsp; this&nbsp; ground,&nbsp; must&nbsp; at&nbsp; least&nbsp; have&nbsp; that&nbsp; degree of certainty&nbsp; which&nbsp; is required&nbsp; o:f written&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; bff specifically enforced.<br><br>"The parol&nbsp; contract&nbsp; must&nbsp; be sufficiently clear and definite to render the precise acts which are to be performed thereunder clearly ascertainable.&nbsp; Its terms must be so clear and complete as to allow no reasonable doubt&nbsp; respecting its&nbsp; enforcement according&nbsp; to the understanding of the&nbsp; parties."&nbsp;&nbsp; (101 A,&nbsp; L.&nbsp; R., pp. 950-951)<br><br>"In&nbsp; this&nbsp; jurisdiction,&nbsp; as in&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States,&nbsp; the existence of an oral agreement&nbsp; or understanding&nbsp; such&nbsp; as that&nbsp; alleged in the complaint in&nbsp; the case at bar&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; maintained&nbsp; on <i>vague, uncertain</i>, and <i>indefinite</i>&nbsp; testimony, against the reasonable presumption that prudent&nbsp; men who enter into such contracts will execute them in writing, and&nbsp; comply&nbsp; with the formalities prescribed by&nbsp; law for the creation of&nbsp; a valid&nbsp; mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; where&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; as to the existence&nbsp; of such&nbsp; an understanding&nbsp; or agreement&nbsp; is&nbsp; <i>clear, convincing</i>, and&nbsp; <i>satisfactory</i>, the same&nbsp; broad&nbsp; principles&nbsp; of equity operate in&nbsp; this jurisdiction&nbsp; as in the United&nbsp; States&nbsp; to compel the parties to&nbsp; live&nbsp; up&nbsp; to the terms of&nbsp; their contract."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cuyugan vs. Santos, 34&nbsp; Phil., 100, 101.)</blockquote>There is another flaw that we find in&nbsp; the decision of the court <i>a&nbsp; quo.</i>&nbsp; During the trial of&nbsp; this case, counsel for appellants objected&nbsp; the&nbsp; admission&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of plaintiff Bernardo Babao and that&nbsp; of his&nbsp; mother&nbsp; Cleofe Perez as to&nbsp; what&nbsp; occurred between Celestina Perez and Santiago Babao with regard to&nbsp; the agreement on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that their testimony was&nbsp; prohibited&nbsp; by&nbsp; section 26(c) of Rule&nbsp; 123 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; This&nbsp; rule prohibits parties or assignors of parties to a case, or persons in whose behalf a case is prosecuted, against an executor or&nbsp; administrator of&nbsp; a deceased&nbsp; person&nbsp; upon a&nbsp; claim or testifying as to any matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; fact occurring before&nbsp; the death of such deceased person.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the trial court&nbsp; over- ruled&nbsp; the opposition&nbsp; saying that said&nbsp; rule did not apply where the complaint against the estate of&nbsp; a deceased person alleges fraud, citing&nbsp; the case of Ong&nbsp; Chua&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Carr,&nbsp; 53 Phil.,&nbsp; 980.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here again the court is in error&nbsp; because if in that case the witness was allowed to testify it was because the&nbsp; existence of fraud was first established by&nbsp; sufficient and competent evidence.&nbsp; Here, however,&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged fraud is predicated upon the&nbsp; existence of the agreement&nbsp; itself which violates the rule of <i>petitio principii</i>.&nbsp; Evidently,&nbsp; the fraud to exist must be established by evidence aliunde and not&nbsp; by the same evidence which is&nbsp; to sought to be prevented.&nbsp; The infringement of the rule is evident.<br><blockquote>'"* * * The reason for this rule is that 'if death has&nbsp; closed&nbsp; the lips of one party,&nbsp; the policy of the law&nbsp; is to close&nbsp; the lips of&nbsp; the other.'&nbsp; Another reason&nbsp; is that 'the temptation to falsehood&nbsp; and concealment in such&nbsp; cases&nbsp; is&nbsp; considered&nbsp; too&nbsp; great to&nbsp; allow&nbsp; the surviving party to testify&nbsp; in his own behalf.'&nbsp; Accordingly,&nbsp; the jncompetency applies&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the deceased&nbsp; died before or after the commencement of the action&nbsp; against him,&nbsp; if at the time&nbsp; the testimony was&nbsp; given&nbsp; he was dead and cannot disprove it, since the reason&nbsp; for the&nbsp; prohibition, which is to&nbsp; discourage perjury, exists in both instances."&nbsp; (Moran, Comments on the&nbsp; Rules of Court, Vol. 3, 1952 Ed., p, 234.)</blockquote>Having reached&nbsp; the conclusion that all the parol evidence&nbsp; of appellee was submitted in violation of the Statute of Frauds, or of the rule which prohibits testimony against deceased persons, we find unnecessary to&nbsp; discuss the other issues raised in appellants' brief.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the case is dismissed,&nbsp; with costs against appellee.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp;
