				<H3>MARIANO BEYSA, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF  FIRST 'INSTANCE OF CAGAYAN, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L.,  J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On  July 12, 1954, herein respondents Proceso Sebastian, et al., filed an action for forcible entry against petitioners Mariano Beysa, et al., in the Justice of the Peace Court of Solana, Cagayan  (Civil Case  No. 56)  for the  recovery of the possession of a parcel of land located in Finulo, Solana, Cagayan  Province.  Upon  motion of  the plaintiffs,  the Justice of the Peace of Solana inhibited himself from acting in the case on the ground that he had once been counsel for the defendants, and designated the Justice of the  peace of Ehrile, Cagayan,  to  try the  same.  Upon  receipt  of the records, the latter notified the  parties that  the case would be tried by him in  the Justice  of  the Peace Court of Enrile; defendants filed a  special appearance objecting to the venue, the land  in question being located in  the municipality of Solana; but  the  Justice  of  the  Peace  of Enrile insisted in trying the case, notified  the parties anew of the date of the trial, issued upon plaintiffs' instance a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining  defendants from continuing in the possession of the land,  tried the case in the absence of the defendants, and on September 18, 1954, rendered judgment for the  plaintiffs.</p>
<p>On October 23, 1954, defendants sued out  a writ of certiorari in the Court of First Instance of Cagayan to annul all the proceedings taken by  the Justice of the Peace Court of Enrile  in Civil  Case  No. 56  of the  Solana Court as having been made without jurisdiction and in grave abuse of discretion. . The Court of First Instance,  however, held that the Justice of the Peace Court did not act as charged and  dismissed  the  petition.   Wherefore,  defendants filed this  petition for certiorari before this Court.</p>
<p>The petition  must  be granted.</p>
<p>The present  law  on the  matter  is  section 73  of  the Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended, which  reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 73.' <em>Auxiliary  justice</em>—<em>Qualifications  and duties.</em>—The auxiliary justice of  the peace shall have the same qualifications and be subject to the same restrictions as the  regular justice, and shall perform the duties of said office during any vacancy therein or in case  of the absence of the regular justice from the municipality, or of his disability or disqualifications  * *   *.</p>
  <p>In  case there is  no auxiliary justice of  the peace to perform the duties of the regular justice in the case above mentioned the district judge shall designate the nearest  justice of the peace of the province to act as  justice of the peace in  such municipality,  town, or place."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the above provision, which was  taken from  sec. 211 of the Administrative Code of 1917, in case the justice of the peace xof a town or municipality  is disqualified to act in  a  case and there is no auxiliary justice to take over his duties, it is the  district judge  who  should designate the nearest justice  of the peace of the province to act in the municipality or town of the disqualified justice.   In other words, the substitute justice shall not  hear the case in his own court, but shall act in the very court where the case is  pending.</p>
<p>It is true that under section 73 of the old Code of Civil Procedure, where the justice of the peace of a municipal is disqualified and the auxiliary justice is also disqualified or otherwise  disabled, "the  cause shall  be transferred to the nearest justice  of  the peace of the province who is not disqualified"; and it was pursuant to this rule that the justice of the peace of Solana transferred Civil Case No. 56 to the justice of the peace of Enrile, who tried and decided the case in his own court.  However, the  rule prescribed by  the  Code of  Civil  Procedure has been repealed and superseded by the  Judiciary Act of 1948,  which was intended to be a complete reenactment of the entire system of substantive law in the field of administration of justice, and which in express terms  repealed all laws and rules inconsistent  with  its  provisions  (section 99).  Significantly, the Judiciary Act, while  reenacting the provisions of section 211  of the  Administrative Code of 1917  (Act No. 2711), does not make any reference  to  the rule of sec. 73 of Act No. 190, clearly implying that  the latter rule is to be deemed no longer in force (In re Guzman, 73 Phil., 51; Posadas <em>vs.</em> National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497,  80 L. ed. 351).</p>
<p>The case of Valera  vs.  Tuason,  45  Off.  Gaz.,  No. 9 (Supp.), p. 443,  cited by the Court of  First  Instance of Cagayan  as  authority  for sustaining  the action of  the justice of the peace of Enrile, is not applicable to this case, because the same was  decided before the passage and approval of the Judiciary Act of 1948.</p>
<p>The appointment of the justice of the peace of  Enrile by the disqualified  justice of Solana to  act in  Civil Case No. 56 of the latter's court is null and void, for it is the district  judge of Cagayan who,  under  the present  law, should designate  the nearest  justice of the peace of the province to act in the matter; and the proceedings taken by the Enrile judge  in his own court are not  only illegal for the law  requires the substitute judge to act in the municipality where the  case is pending but highly irregular, for defendants had the right to have the case tried in the court of proper venue, the Solana court,  and were  justified in refusing to go to trial in Enrile; and by insisting in hearing the  case in  Enrile  in the absence of defendants, the justice  of the peace  of Enrile virtually  denied them the fundamental right to a day in court.</p>
<p>Wherefore, all  proceedings taken ty the  justice of the peace of Enrile, Cagayan in Civil Case No. 56 of the Justice of the  Peace Court of  Solana are hereby  annulled;  and the district judge of Cagayan Province is instructed to designate the nearest justice of the peace of the province to act  in  said  cause.  Costs against the private  parties respondent.  So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista  Angela, Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
