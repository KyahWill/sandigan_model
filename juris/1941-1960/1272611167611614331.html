				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In October 1950, in the Manila municipal court, Yu Phi Khim 
obtained judgment requiring Teng Giok Yan to vacate plaintiff's premises, on 
Ilaya Street, Manila, to pay the rentals theretofore unpaid, and monthly 
thereafter to pay P440. Judgment was likewise rendered for damages and 
attorney's fees. 
<p align="justify">Teng Giok Yan appealed to the court of first instance, and 
during the pendency of his appeal he deposited in court the monthly rentals. But 
on December 10, 1951 Yu Phi Khim filed a motion for execution of the judgment, 
alleging failure of the defendant Teng Giok Yan to pay the rents "in advance on 
or before the fifth day of each month". The motion was denied.</p>
<p align="justify">Hence this petition for mandamus, based upon the undenied fact 
that the rent for December 1951 was deposited on the sixth day of that month and 
upon Rule 72 section 8 partly providing that execution shall issue unless the 
defendant during the pendency of the appeal "pays to the plaintiff or to the 
Court of First Instance the amount of rent due from time to time under the 
contract, if any, <span style="font-style: italic;">as found by the judgment</span> of the justice of the peace or 
municipal court to exist". Petitioner alleges that under the lease contract he 
had with Teng Giok Yan, the monthly rental was payable in advance on or before 
the fifth day of each month; and as the rental for December was paid on the 
sixth day, execution must issue. </p>
<p align="justify">In his answer filed here, respondent Teng Giok Yan denies that 
the contract contained such stipulation as to time for payment.</p>
<p align="justify">We are all of opinion that under the circumstances the petition 
may not prevail. The judgment of the municipal court attached to this petition 
did not declare that a contract of lease existed between the parties. Neither 
did it declare that under the terms of such contract the rents were payable 
within the first five days of the month in advance. And respondent denies that 
the contract requires payment within five days. As we understand it, the portion 
of the Rules invoked by petitioner requires as condition <span style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non</span> that the 
judgment shall make specific findings as to the existence and the terms of the 
contract. The words "as found by the judgment" are very material. </p>
<p align="justify">Section 8 Rule 72 reads in part: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"If judgment is rendered against the defendant, execution shall 
issue immediately, unless an appeal has been perfected and the defendant to stay 
execution files a sufficient bond approved by the justice of the peace or 
municipal court and executed to the plaintiff to enter the action in the Court 
of First Instance, and to pay the rents, damages, and costs down to the time of 
the final judgment in the action, and unless, during the pendency of the appeal, 
he pays to the plaintiff or to the Court of First Instance the amount of rent 
due from time to time under the contract, if any, as found by the judgment of 
the justice of the peace or municipal court to exist, or, <span style="font-style: italic;">in the absence of a 
contract he pays to the plaintiff or into the court, on or before the tenth 
day of each calendar month</span>, the reasonable value of the use and occupation of 
the premises for the preceding month at the rate determined by the 
judgment."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We think this case falls under the portion underlined by us. 
The words "in the absence of contract" covers not only the situation where there 
is no contract actually, but also where the judgment does not make findings as 
to the existence and/or terms of the contract. The amount required to be paid in 
such case being equivalent to the reasonable value of occupation. </p>
<p align="justify">In other words where the time for payment under the contract of 
lease is not specifically declared in the judgment of the justice of the peace 
or municipal court, the ten day period must be followed. There is no desire or 
purpose to permit the court of first instance, in a motion like this, to go 
beyond the judgment receiving evidence as to the terms of the contract and the 
time of payment. </p>
<p align="justify">Anyway in this case, waiver might be imputed to the petitioner, 
it appearing that although all monthly payments from January 1951 to December of 
that year had been <span style="font-style: italic;">made after the fifth</span> he did not protest until December 10th 
1951.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore the petition is denied with costs. </p>
