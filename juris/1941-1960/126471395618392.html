				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  is  an appeal  by  certiorari under Rule 44  from  a decision rendered  on 2  August 1954  and the resolution in  bane  adopted  on 24 August 1954  by the Court of Inr dustrial  Relations  denying a motion of  13  August 1954 filed by the petitioners for reconsideration  of the decision.</p>
<p>On 15 July 1953 a report in the form  of a  complaint was filed  by the respondents and  members of  the Bisig fig  Manggagawa fig Manila Yellow Taxicab  Co.,  Inc.,  a legitimate  labor union duly registered with the  Department of Labor, hereafter called  Union, representing  at least ten per centum of its  membership, charging the petitioners with unfair labor practices under the provisions of section  17, Republic Act No. 875,  and requesting for certification election under  the provisions of section  12 (<em>b</em>)  and (<em>c</em>)  of the  same Act.  They  alleged that  Ramon Angeles  was  dismissed from  his  employment  as driver in the Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc., hereafter called Company,  and from the  membership in the Union, without  the  benefit of  investigation  and  hearing  but  upon the instigation and  intrigue of the petitioners; and that Felix Mapili, Manuel Salvador and Dominador Bolinao were dismissed  also from their  employment as driver in the Company by virtue of and pursuant to  a closed shop agreement between the Company and the Union, as a result of their unjust  and arbitrary  expulsion  from the  Union  by the  petitioners, president,  vice-president,  secretary and members  of  the board of  directors.  They claimed that their expulsion from the Union caused by the petitioners was due,  among others,  to  their  attempt  to inquire into and inspect the books of account and other records relative to financial  activities of the Union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  They prayed, that the petitioners  be required to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice; that the respondents dismissed from the  Company and the  Union  be reinstated  with back pay in their employment in the Company and membership in the Union; and that an election of the  officers of the Union be ordered.</p>
<p>On 1  August  1953, the  petitioners filed their  answer denying and  admitting  certain  facts set forth  in the complaint  and alleging  that respondent Ramon  Angeles was dismissed  after due  investigation  conducted  on 27 June 1953 and  found guilty of having committed a grave offense against the interest  of  the company,  and  that respondents Felix Mapili, Manuel Salvador and Dominador Bolinao  were  dismissed  also  after due  hearing  and investigation, in order to preserve the collective interest and security of all the members of the  Union.</p>
<p>After hearing, the Court of Industrial Relations rendered a decision the dispositive part of which  is, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>FOR THE ABOVE CONSIDERATION,  the  Court hereby declares the closed-shop condition  of the agreement Exhibit "9"  null and void and  the respondents  guilty  of  unfair labor   practice  under the provisions of Section  4(6)  of  Republic Act No. 875,  and therefore, requires them:</p>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) To cease and desist from such unfair labor practice;</p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) To post this  order  within ten  (10)  days,  after it has become final, in a place  within the  premises  of the Manila Yellow  Taxicab Co., Inc. accessible to  all its  employees  and  to report to this Court that same has  been complied with; and (c) To pay a  fine  collectively  in  the  amount of five hundred pesos (P500).  Annex A.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The  petitioners  contend  that  the resolution  of  the Court in bane  denying  their  motion  for reconsideration of  the decision was not adopted in accordance  with law and hence null and void; that Republic Act No. 875 does not apply to the case at  bar,  because  the  alleged acts constituting  unfair labor practice were  committed before the Act took  effect;  that  even  assuming that  Republic Act No. 875 applies to the  case, still the  Court  of Industrial  Relations committed an error when it  held that the closed-shop agreement  entered  into  by and between the Company and  the Union  is  null and void;  'and that the Court committed  an error  in  imposing  a  collective fine of P500 on the petitioners.</p>
<p>The Court of Industrial Relations  made the  following findings :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The evidence adduced by the parties  established  the following facts:</p>
  <p>That  Ramon Angeles,  Dominador  Bolinao, Manuel Salvador and Felix Mapili  are  tbe complainants  in this case, who are  members of  the Bisig fig Manggagawa  fig  Manila  Yellow Taxicab Co.,  Inc.  and  drivers of  the Manila  Yellow Taxicab  Co., Inc.; that three  of them,  namely, Ramon  Angeles,   Manuel  Salvador and  Felix Mapili,  and  two  others,  also  members of  said  union and  drivers  of the same  company,  on June 2, 1953, filed with the Department of Labor  a complaint against the respondents  in this  case  for forcible deductions  of their salaries and/or  undue collections, etc.;  that pursuant  thereto  the  Labor  Organization Unit  of the  Department  of  Labor  took  cognizance  of  the case and  conducted the  investigation on June  17, 1953; that on June 11,  1953,  however,  the  above  named four complainants  were summoned  to appear before the board of directors of the  union because  of  their  complaint  in  the  Department  of  Labor and upon  their  appearance  and failure of the   board  to   investigate  them, they  (complainants)  requested  the members  of  the board to hold  a general meeting  in  order to air their grievances to all the members of the union and  justify  their  action in filing the  complaint in  the  Department  of Labor;   that  said request was never  granted,  and  instead the  complainants later on  received  letters of dismissal  from the company upon demand  of  the union  pursuant to the  closed shop agreement   executed between the Manila1 Yellow Taxicab  Co., Inc. and the  Bisig  fig  Manggagawa ng Manila  Yellow  Taxicab Co., Inc.  on March  16, 1953 (Exhibit "9").</p>
  <p>The  dates and  causes  of dismissal  of  complainants appear  in the corresponding  letters of dismissal stated below:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li> Ramon Angeles  was dismissed  on July 1,  1953 for  "running with your  flag-up with  passenger"  according to the  letter  dated July 1, 1953  marked  as Exhibit  "3";<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Dominador Bolinao was dismissed on July 3, 1953  upon demand of the union  to the company for  having been expelled as member pursuant  to the close  shop  agreement Exhibit   rt9" as shown  in the letter of  July 3, 1953 marked as Exhibit "B";<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Manuel  Salvador was dismissed  on July  3,  1953 for  the same reason  as  above stated  in  accordance  with the   letter  dated July 3, 1953 marked as Exhibit  "B-l";<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Felix Mapili was dismissed on July 3, 1953  for similar  reason as stated in No. 2 above as mentioned in the  letter of July 3, 1953 marked as Exhibit "B-2".</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>contains a petition for certification  election and  charges of  unfair As may  be seen  from the above quoted complaint  the same labor practice.  However,  as there is  no evidence to  support said petition for certification election the same is hereby denied.</p>
  <p>This case then shall  be treated  only  for  unfair labor practice.</p>
  <p>From the face of the aforesaid facts  it  is clear that the dismissal of the  last  three (3)  drivers  from their work,  except the first  one, was due  to the closed-shop condition of the agreement Exhibit "9", following1 their expulsion  from the  union.  The closed-shop  condition  of  the  agreement,  Exhibit  "9",  states  as follows:</p>
  <p>"3. That  the  Union  manifests   and  recognizes  the right and authority of  the Employer to  select its drivers,  employees and laborers:  Provided, That  in all positions of drivers  in the  company,  no appointee shall  be allowed  to  work unless  he or she is a  bona fide  member of the  Union: And Provided Further,  That the Union shall  be clothed with prerogatives to recommend to the company  the  dismissal or removal  of  any driver who  has  violated the rules  and regulations of the Union or who, thru his misconduct, negligence or disloyalty has become a persona  non grata  to the Union, after  an  investigation."</p>
  <p>The  complainants in this case have  been  expelled  from  the union,  according  to the resolution of the board of  directors  of the^ union dated June  17,  1953  (Exhibit "8"), because  said  complainants  "with  their activities  fomented confusion,  disorder and discontentment"  among  the members  of  the union and tried "to undermine and destroy the Union."</p>
  <p>The  complaint filed by  the complainants in the  Department  of Labor, as shown by the above facts, can not possibly be considered a  violation  of  the  rules  and  regulations  of the  union  nor a misconduct,  negligence or  disloyalty on the part of said complainants pursuant to  the above  quoted  condition inasmuch as  said complaint was  to  seek  an  investigation of  an  irregularity.  It can  be said further that  the  complaint was in  the  exercise  of complainants'  right  as provided for in section 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 213.</p>
  <p>It is obvious,  therefore,  that the action of  the board of directors of the union in expelling  from  its  membership and  demanding the dismissal  from the company of the three (3)  drivers,  namely, Dominador  Bolinao, Manuel  Salvador  and  Felix Mapili  under the  pretext  that they  have  violated the  rules and regulations of the union  or  through misconduct, negligence or disloyalty  they have  become  persona,  non  grata,  to  the union,  without  proving satisfactorily  that  an  investigation into  said  charges  was  ever conducted, is very arbitrary and unjust and not only a violation of  the  above quoted condition  but also  caused the  employer to discriminate against  the said three (3) complainants  in this case. Therefore, pursuant  to section  4(6),  subsection  (2)  of Republic Act No, 875, said action constitutes unfair labor  practice.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, said  close-shop condition of  the  agreement  exhibit "9" is null and void  (section 8[c]  of  said Republic Act).  Because such closed-shop condition  permits either party or both, the commission  of  unfair labor practice  as  in  fact the respondents in this case have  committed  in demanding  from  the  company the dismissal of  the above mentioned three  (3) drivers.</p>
  <p>It may be argued in  this connection that this  Court, being  a special  Court, does not  have the power and  jurisdiction to  declare and decide on the validity or legality  of said closed-shop condition. This is  not  so, because according to section 5(c)  of said Act, this Court has power and jurisdiction  to abrogate such closed-shop condition  if  such  condition' "is  effected by  means of, or  which resulted  in, unfair labor practice"  (Rothenberg on Labor  Relations, p. 577; N. L. R. B.  V8.  Superior Tanning Co., 117 F. [2nd] 881; N.  L. R. B. vs. National  Licorice Co., 309 Co.,  309 U.  S. 350 modifying 104 F.  [2nd]  885;  etc.)</p>
  <p>Since  the dismissal of Ramon Angeles, is other than  an unfair labor practice,  the Court,  therefore, is without  power and jurisdiction  to  decide the  same, even under  Commonwealth Act No.  103, section 19,  for lack of jurisdictional number of workers involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no merit  in  the contention  that the  resolution appealed  from signed by four judges of  the  Court of Industrial  Relations  is  null  and void.   The   fact   that they signed the resolution means that they sat together in  consultation and  in  passing upon the  motion for reconsideration  filed by the petitioners, and  the number of judges  that took part  therein  is  one more   than the number  required  to  render  and  adopt a  resolution.  If the  concurrence of three judges  is enough  for the  Court of  Industrial  Relations to  render  a   valid decision or resolution, it stands to reason that three judges are enough to constitute a quorum.</p>
<p>"The  complainants  (herein  respondents)  in  this  case have been  expelled   from the Union,  according to the resolution of the (its) board of directors * *  *  dated  June 17, 1953  (Exhibit '8'), because said complainants 'with their activities fomented confusion,  disorder and  discontentment' among  the  members of  the  Union  and tried 'to undermine and destroy the Union " but the Court of Industrial Relations found  that "The complaint filed  by the  complainants  (herein  respondents)  in the Department of Labor, as shown by the above facts, cannot possibly be considered a violation of the rules and regulations of the Union nor a misconduct, negligence or  disloyalty on the  part of said complainants  (herein respondents) pursuant to the above quoted condition  inasmuch  as said complaint was to seek an investigation of an irregularity. It can  be said further that the  complaint was  in  the exercise of complainants' right  as provided for in section 4  of Commonwealth Act No. 213."</p>
<p>The petitioners draw  the  attention of  this  Court to the  resolution  of the  board  of directors  of  the Union dated 11 June 1953  (Exhibit 8, Annex E of the petition) and  contend that such resolution of  the board of directors of the  Union found  untrue by the Court  of  Industrial Relations cannot be the basis of  the decision and resolution appealed from  because as the acts complained of  as constituting  unfair  labor practice were  committed  before 11 June 1953, Republic  Act No. 875  which  took effect on 17 June 1953 cannot be  applied.   A law that penalizes an act  not  punishable at the time  it was performed is ex post  facto.   However,  retroactivity of  laws that  are remedial in  nature  is  not  prohibited.  And taking into consideration the declared policy of Republic Act No.  875 to eliminate the causes of industrial  unrest and to promote sound  and  stable industrial  peace,1 there seems to  be no valid  reason  why the  law could not  be  applied to acts  taking place before its enactment which would cause or bring about an  industrial  unrest.   The acts  of  the petitioners, as found by the Court of Industrial  Relations, are  sufficient to  support the  pronouncement  that  they constitute unfair labor practice, as provided for in section 4, paragraph (&amp;),  sub-paragraph  (2)  of Republic  Act No.  875.</p>
<p>But the Court of Industrial  Relations  erred  when  it held that the closed-shop  agreement  (Exhibit 9;  Annex C)  is null  and  void because  it  contravenes  section  8, paragraph (c)  of Republic Act No.  875, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Every undertaking or promise hereafter made, whether  written or oral,  express or  implied,  constituting  or  contained  in  any contract or agreement of hiring or  employment between  any individual firm, company, association or corporation and any employee or prospective  employee  of  the  same shall  be  null and  void  if thereby—</p>
  <p>(<em>a</em>) * *  * ;<br></p>
  <p>(<em>b</em>) *  * * ;<br></p>
  <p>(<em>c</em>)  Either  party  undertakes or promises  to permit the commission  of  any of the unfair  labor practices defined in  section four hereof.</p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">We do not believe that such an agreement is null and void because it is expressly authorized  by section 4(a),  paragraph 4,"  of the  same  Act, which provides: </p>
  <p>It shall be unfair  labor practice for an employer:</p>
  <p>* *  *</p>
  <p>(4) To  discriminate in regard to  hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization:  Provided,  That nothing in this Act  or in any  other Act or statute of the Republic  of the Philippines  shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization to require as  a condition of employment membership therein, if  such labor organization is the representative of the employees as  provided in section  twelve;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>section  8(<em>c</em>) of the Act above coppied  refers to  "Every undertaking or  promise * * *  constituting  or  contained in any  contract  or agreement  of  hiring  or employment between any individual firm, company *  * * and any employee or prospective employes  of  the same shall  be null and void if thereby—* * *  (<em>c</em>) Either  party  undertakes or promises ro permit the commission oi any of the unfair labor  practices  denned  in   section  four  hereof."  It contemplates  and refers to an  undertaking or  promise by  an  individual firm and an  employee or  prospective employee and not to a close-shop agreement which is lawful, as provided for  in section 4(<em>a</em>),  paragraph 4, of the Act.  We fail  to  see  the  illegality of the close-shop agreement entered into by and between  the  Union  and the Company in  the absence of  showing  that the officers of the  Union were not the true choice  of  the  members thereof, as they  should be in accordance with section 12 of the Act.</p>
<p>The prayer or request of the respondents for certification election is no longer  urged by  them.</p>
<p>What was  unfair and discriminatory  was  the unlawful and unjust expulsion or dismissal from the Union of Felix Mapili, Manuel  Salvador  and Dominador  Bolinao, three of the herein respondents, without  justifiable  cause that brought about their dismissal by the Company in accordance with  the  closed-shop  agreement.</p>
<p>Lastly, without deciding and withholding our opinion on whether under the Constitution the Court of Industrial Relations, as  at  present  organized  and constituted,  may be  authorized  or empowered  to impose  a fine  upon a party found by it guilty of unfair labor practice, as provided  for  in section  25 of Republic  Act No.  875,  we agree with counsel for the petitioners that the Court of Industrial  Relations could not impose a fine  collectively upon  the  petitioners,  because section 25 of Republic  Act No. 875, being of penal character,  should not and  could not be applied retroactively.</p>
<p>Upon the  foregoing considerations, the decisions  appealed  from  affirmed by  the  resolution  also  appealed from  is modified by striking therefrom  the  penalty of P500  imposed  collectively upon  the petitioners  and  the declaration  that  the  closed-shop  agreement  is null  and void,  and  adding  to  it  a directive  to  the petitioners, members of  the  Board  of Directors  of the  Bisig ng Manggagawa hg Manila Yellow Taxicab  Co., Inc. to reinstate the three respondents, Felix Mapili, Manuel Salvador and Dominador Bolinap to the membership in the Union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The rest of the decision is affirmed, with  costs against the petitioners.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C.  J.,  Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes,  A., Jugo, Bautista  Angelo, Labrador,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</em> and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
