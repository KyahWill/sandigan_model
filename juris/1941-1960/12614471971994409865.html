				<H3>CEBU PORT LABOR UNION, REPRESENTED  BY ITS  PRESIDENT ALEJO  CABABAJAY, PETITIONER,  VS.  STATES MARINE CORPORATION, NICASIO PANSACALA, ANDRES TURA,  ALFONSO VILLAJAS, AND PERPETUO REGIS, RESPONDENTS. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present appeal is from a decision of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Cebu, Civil Case No. R-3272, to the Court of Appeals which the latter Court certified to Us pursuant to Section 17(3) of the Judiciary Act of 1948,&nbsp; on the ground that it&nbsp; involves a&nbsp; question of&nbsp; jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts of the&nbsp; case may be summarized as follows: <br><br>On September 12, 1953, the Cebu Port Labor Union, a duly&nbsp; registered&nbsp; labor association,&nbsp; represented by its&nbsp; pres- ident, Aiejo Cababajay, filed a petition with the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cebu for&nbsp; "recognition of&nbsp; stevedoring service&nbsp; and injunction" against the States Marine&nbsp; Corporation, Nicasio Pansacala, Andres Tura, Alfonso Villajas, and&nbsp; Perpetuo Regis.&nbsp; It&nbsp; alleged,&nbsp; among others, that the States Marine Corporation is a corporation&nbsp; duly organized and&nbsp; existing under the laws of the Philippines and&nbsp; could be served with summons through Mr. J. Gotianuy, whereas the other respondents are "capataces" of a group of laborers&nbsp; and/or&nbsp; stevedores;&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioning Union&nbsp; was awarded a contract for the exclusive right of loading and unloading of the cargoes of the vessel M/V Bisayas formerly owned by Elizalde &amp;&nbsp; Co., though at the&nbsp; time of the filing of the petition it was owned and operated&nbsp; by the States Marine Corporation; that said&nbsp; vessel would&nbsp; soon resume&nbsp; its voyage and it came to the&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; of said petitioner that the stevedoring work will be given by the respondent corporation to the other respondents in violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the agreement and/or understanding had between the Manager of the&nbsp; respondent corporation and the President of the petitioner Union; that said act would&nbsp; deprive petitioner of its&nbsp; right of loading and unloading the&nbsp; cargoes of said boat&nbsp; and will cause said petitioner&nbsp; irreparable loss&nbsp; and&nbsp; injury.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Union,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; that&nbsp; a writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; enjoining the States Marine Corporation from giving the work of&nbsp; loading and unloading the cargoes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the vessel M/V Bisayas to its corespondents or their representatives or agents or Cebu Port Labor Union vs. States Marine Co., et al. to any other person, and further enjoining the respondents from molesting and preventing the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; from peace fully doing said&nbsp; loading&nbsp; and unloading work; that after hearing, the injunction be made permanent; that the petitioner be&nbsp; declared&nbsp; with the&nbsp; right to load and unload&nbsp; the cargoes of the M/V Bisayas, thereby respecting the contract entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; by petitioner and Elizalde&nbsp; &amp; Co. and subsequently enforced&nbsp; and&nbsp; continued&nbsp; by the&nbsp; respondent States Marine Corporation, and for such other relief consistent with law and equity. <br><br>The Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Cebu,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; receipt of the petition and considering&nbsp; it to be well-founded,&nbsp; ordered <i>ex parte</i> the issuance of the writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction upon petitioner's filing a bond in the sum of P1,000, which writ&nbsp; was&nbsp; actually&nbsp; issued on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp; The Sheriff's return of service of the writ of injunction showed that respondents Alfonso Villajas,&nbsp; Perpetuo Regis, Nicasio Par.sacala and&nbsp; Andres&nbsp; Tura were personally served with said&nbsp; order.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the left&nbsp; part of said return there was a note of this&nbsp; tenor: "States&nbsp; Marine Corp. was&nbsp; dissolve on Oct. 17, 1952" followed by an illegible countersign. <br><br>On September&nbsp; 22, 1953, respondents Nicasio Pansacala, Andres Tura, Alfonso Villajas and Perpetuo Regis,&nbsp; through counsel, filed&nbsp; an ex-parte motion for&nbsp; dissolution&nbsp; (of&nbsp; the writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction),&nbsp;&nbsp; alleging among other things, that said&nbsp; writ would&nbsp; cause great damage to&nbsp; the respondents since the defunct&nbsp; States Marine&nbsp; Corporation never&nbsp; awarded any&nbsp; contract to petitioner and that&nbsp; likewise the present owners of the&nbsp; vessel (M/V Bisayas) never entered into a contract&nbsp; with&nbsp; said&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; relative to stevedoring work; that the allegations of the petition were insufficient since the respondent corporation was no longer existing; that granting that Eliaalde &amp; Co.&nbsp; and petitioner had a contract regarding the loading and unloading of the cargoes of the M/V Bisayas, it cannot be maintained that said petitioner had any right to follow this vessel to whomsoever it may belong; and that they were willing to post a counterbond in the sum of P2,000 for the dissolution of the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of preliminary&nbsp; injunction.&nbsp; This&nbsp; motion&nbsp; was granted by the Court on September 22, 1953. <br><br>On October 2, 1953,&nbsp; respondents filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion to dismiss based on the following grounds: (1) That the Court has&nbsp; no jurisdiction over the parties affected&nbsp; and&nbsp; the subject matter of&nbsp; the action.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; respondents' contention that the case involves an action of a labor union against management and therefore falls within the exclusive jurisdiction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations.&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; That the complaint (petition)&nbsp; states no cause of action.&nbsp; It is alleged&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petition mentions&nbsp; the&nbsp; exclusive&nbsp; right granted by Elizalde &amp; Co. to petitioning&nbsp; Union, but&nbsp; there was no&nbsp; showing that in the transaction&nbsp; between&nbsp; Elizalde &amp;&nbsp; Co. and the&nbsp; States Marine Corporation the contractual obligation of the former&nbsp; to the Union was considered in order that same may deserve the respect of the new owner of the vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; That respondent corporation has&nbsp; no legal capacity to sue&nbsp; or be sued, it having been dissolved on October 17, 1952, and therefore has no personality to enter or refuse to, enter&nbsp; into any contract, much less of threatening the&nbsp; petitioner as alleged in the petition.&nbsp; Petitioner filed on October 5,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; its opposition refuting the grounds&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion to dismiss, to which&nbsp; respondents replied denying&nbsp; some of the averments of the petition and admitting some of them,&nbsp; and at&nbsp; the same time&nbsp; filing a counterclaim charging&nbsp; the President of&nbsp; the petitioning Union, Alejo Cababajay, with bad&nbsp; faith;&nbsp; that&nbsp; due to their malicious inclusion as'&nbsp; respondents, they suffered mental anguish&nbsp; and anxiety and prayed&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; they&nbsp; be&nbsp; awarded p40,000.00 as&nbsp; moral damages,&nbsp; P10,000.00&nbsp; as corrective damages and P10,000.00 for attorney's fees. <br><br>After the Union filed its answer&nbsp; to the counterclaim and the&nbsp; motion to&nbsp;&nbsp; dismiss was&nbsp; heard,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court issued&nbsp; an order denying&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents'&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss and ruled that it had jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case was then set for trial and&nbsp; after the parties&nbsp; had&nbsp; rested&nbsp; their case, the&nbsp; Court rendered decision&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1953, finding that Mr. Joseph&nbsp; Gotianuy,&nbsp; President of the Royal Lines (which is the company operating the M/V Melliza, formerly&nbsp; the M/V Bisayas)&nbsp; agreed verbally to award the stevedoring work to the union headed by Alejo Cababajay; that such agreement was made orally because it was not the practice to put such kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; in&nbsp; writing; that although respondent offered in evidence a&nbsp; certification purportedly made by Joseph Gotianuy to the effect that the stevedoring job of&nbsp; loading and&nbsp; unloading of cargoes on the M/V Melliza was awarded to the group of laborers headed by Andres Tura, said certification was made only after the&nbsp; filing of the present petition thereby strengthen- ing the allegation that&nbsp; respondents'&nbsp; groups tried to&nbsp; grab from petitioner the work&nbsp; already&nbsp; given&nbsp; to them by said Gotianuy; that the preponderance&nbsp; of&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; militates in favor of&nbsp; petitioner, and declared: <br><br><blockquote><br>"In view thereof, this Court hereby&nbsp; renders&nbsp; judgment recognizing&nbsp; petitioner Labor Union under Alejo&nbsp; Cababajay&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; party with authority to render such services of loading and unloading the cargoes&nbsp; on&nbsp; the M/V Melliza while in the port of Cebu, orders the issuance of a permanent writ of injunction prohibiting respondent's laborers from molesting petitioner's laborers therein and respondents to reimburse&nbsp; said, petitioners&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; wages&nbsp; that they failed to earn, with the&nbsp; costs against the respondents." </blockquote><br><br>Respondents' petition to&nbsp; set aside judgment and for new trial dated&nbsp; December 16, 1953, and&nbsp; their motion to stay execution&nbsp; of judgment&nbsp; dated December 18,&nbsp; 1953, having been denied on December&nbsp; 19, 1953,&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; appealed therefrom ascribing to the lower Court the commission of the following errors, to wit: <br><br><blockquote><br><ol><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<li> 1. Tn holding that it had jurisdiction over this&nbsp; case which involves n&nbsp; labor-management dispute; <br>2. Tn&nbsp; declaring defendant States Marine Corporation in default for failing&nbsp; lo answer or&nbsp; appear within&nbsp; the&nbsp; statutory period; <br>3. In&nbsp; refusing to&nbsp; grant a new trial requested by&nbsp; the appellants in order to present a material witness Joseph Gotianuy whose tes- timony could not be had during the hearing- for&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; beyond the control of the respondents,<br>&nbsp;4.&nbsp; In&nbsp; holding that the owner of the M/V Melliza had verbally agreed to&nbsp; recognize the petitioner Cebu&nbsp; Port Labor&nbsp; Union as the party who should undertake the loading- and unloading- of cargoes .611 the said vessel while in the port of Cebu; <br>&nbsp;5.&nbsp; In allowing the petitioner to undertake&nbsp; or perform indefinitely the stevedoring work on the M/V Melliza; <br>&nbsp;6.&nbsp; In not holding that the men under appellant Andres&nbsp; Tura are the proper and rightful group to undertake the loading and&nbsp; unloading of the cargoes on the M/V Melliza; and <br>&nbsp;7.&nbsp; In condemning the respondents to reimburse the petitioner the wages that its members allegedly failed to earn. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> ?<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</blockquote><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;As we&nbsp; have stated at&nbsp; the beginning of this decision, this case was&nbsp; originally appealed to the Court of Appeals which Court certified the same to us on the ground that it involves a&nbsp; question&nbsp; of jurisdiction.&nbsp; This question, however,&nbsp; en- folds two counts, i.e., the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court (a)&nbsp; to take cognizance of the case, and (6) over the person of&nbsp; the respondent States&nbsp; Marine Corporation which, according to&nbsp; the records,&nbsp; appeared&nbsp; to&nbsp; be non-existent at the time of the institution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petition herein, and for the further reason&nbsp; that it was never summoned in this&nbsp; case. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The&nbsp; question of&nbsp; jurisdiction of the&nbsp; lower Court to take cognizance of&nbsp; this case&nbsp; was put&nbsp; in issue not only in the appeal but likewise in the motion to dismiss presented by herein appellants in the lower court.&nbsp; It was maintained by respondents-appellants that paragraphs 4 and&nbsp; 5 of the petition speak of an alleged agreement between the management of the States Marine Corporation and the President of the&nbsp; petitioning Union and, therefore, that it falls within the&nbsp; jurisdiction of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations.&nbsp; In support&nbsp; of&nbsp; such contention appellants cited Section&nbsp; 1 of Commonwealth Act No, 103, which states the following: <br>&nbsp;<br><blockquote><br>&nbsp;"Section 1.—-<i>Jurisdiction—Judges</i>.—There is created a Court of Industrial Relations, hereinafter called the Court, which&nbsp; shall have jurisdiction over the entire&nbsp; Philippines, to consider, investigate, decide&nbsp; and&nbsp; settle. all questions, matters,&nbsp; controversies,&nbsp; or disputes arising"&nbsp; between,&nbsp; and/or&nbsp; affecting employers&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; employees or laborers, and landlords and tenants or farm-laborers, and regulate the&nbsp; relations between&nbsp; them, subject to the provisions of this Act. </blockquote><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;And&nbsp; to&nbsp; substantiate&nbsp; their&nbsp; claim that the&nbsp; controversy in the instant&nbsp; case&nbsp; is a dispute between employer&nbsp; and&nbsp; employees,&nbsp; respondents mentioned the case of Pambujan&nbsp; Sur United Mine Workers vs.&nbsp; Samar Mining Co., Inc.*&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp;&nbsp; L-5694, promulgated&nbsp; May&nbsp; 12,&nbsp; 1954, wherein&nbsp; this Court held that the&nbsp; refusal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the company to&nbsp; abide by the terms&nbsp; of the contract in&nbsp; spite of the repeated written demands of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; for compliance&nbsp; therewith is a dispute&nbsp; and therefore falls within the broad jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; this pro- vision (Sec.&nbsp; 1&nbsp; of Com. Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 103)&nbsp; granting&nbsp; "broad" jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; was curtailed by the passage of. Republic Act No. 875, known as the Industrial&nbsp; Peace Act&nbsp; and&nbsp; approved&nbsp; on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 17, 1953,&nbsp; so as&nbsp; to&nbsp; limit the jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; Court to certain specific cases&nbsp; to the exclusion of the others.&nbsp;&nbsp; This matter was&nbsp; squarely&nbsp; passed&nbsp; upon in recent cases decided by this&nbsp; Court wherein it was stated that:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<blockquote><br>&nbsp;" * * by the passage&nbsp; of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 875, the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations&nbsp; has been limited to the following cases;:&nbsp; (1) when&nbsp; the labor dispute affects an industry&nbsp; which, is indispensable to the national interest and is so certified by&nbsp; the President to the&nbsp; industrial court (Section&nbsp; 10, Republic Act 876);&nbsp; (2) when the&nbsp; controversy refers to minimum wage under the Minimum Wagc&nbsp; Law&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 602); (3) when it&nbsp; involves hours of employment&nbsp; under the Eight-Hour Labor Law (Commonwealth Act A'ii) ;&nbsp; and (4)&nbsp; when it involves an&nbsp; unfair labor&nbsp; practice (Section 5 (a), Republic Act 875)"—Philippine Association of Free Labor Lemons (PAFLU) et al. vs. Hon. Eienvenido A. Tan et al., G. R. No. L-9115, promulgated Auk. 31, 1966; Apolonia Reyes et al. vs.&nbsp; Hon. Bienvenido Tan ct al., 99 Phil., 880.&nbsp; </blockquote><br><br>It appearing that the&nbsp; present controversy is&nbsp; not one of the cases&nbsp; enumerated above&nbsp; which this Court&nbsp; held&nbsp; to be cognizable by the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations, the&nbsp; lower Court acted&nbsp; rightly in maintaining&nbsp; that it had jurisdiction to try and decide this case.<br><br>Anent the question of jurisdiction over the person of respondent States Marine Corporation, the following can be " 94 Phil.,&nbsp; 932&nbsp; said:&nbsp; there is no&nbsp; denial that the&nbsp; vessel M/V Bisaxas, formerly&nbsp; owned by Elizalde&nbsp; &amp; Co. or its subsidiary the Manila Steamship&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; was&nbsp; sold&nbsp; to the States&nbsp; Marine Corporation and later purchased by the Royal Lines, Inc., which renamed it&nbsp; the M/V&nbsp; Melliza.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is not disputed either that Joseph Gotianuy&nbsp; who was the President and General Manager of the States Marine Corporation is the same Joseph Gotianuy, who is presently the General Manager of the Royal&nbsp; Lines, Inc.&nbsp; But there is no showing whatsoever that the Royal Lines, Inc. has anything to do or&nbsp; any connection&nbsp; with the&nbsp; States Marine&nbsp; Corporation. Petitioner's witnesses were unanimous in their testimonies that Joseph Gotianuy awarded the stevedoring jobs on the M/V&nbsp; Melliza to the labor&nbsp; group headed&nbsp; by Alejo Cababajay&nbsp; sometime in May, 1953,&nbsp; and when they received information that the work would&nbsp; be&nbsp; given to another labor group&nbsp; they filed a petition&nbsp; in court against the&nbsp; States Marine Corporation and the&nbsp; four&nbsp; "capataees" to&nbsp; compel the corporation to&nbsp; respect their&nbsp; agreement and&nbsp; to enjoin the other respondents, from&nbsp; taking away&nbsp; their&nbsp; job.&nbsp; Re- spondents, however, were&nbsp; able&nbsp; to&nbsp; present a certification from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the effect that on <i>October 17</i>, 1052, a resolution dissolving the States Marine Corporation was duly registered in said Office, so that when the petition against said corporation&nbsp; was filed on&nbsp; <i>September</i> 12,&nbsp; 1953, the&nbsp; States Marine&nbsp; Corporation was no longer in existence. <br><br>Sections 1 and 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provide the following: "<br><br><blockquote><br>Section 1. WHO MAY BE PARTIES.—Only natural or juridical persons may be parties in a&nbsp; civil action." <br><br>"Sec. 2. PARTIES IN&nbsp; INTEREST.—Every&nbsp; action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in&nbsp; interest." </blockquote><br><br>From the prayer in the petition filed with&nbsp; the lower Court, it was clear&nbsp; that the&nbsp; petitioning Union,&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; herein, seeks&nbsp; to&nbsp; enforce the&nbsp; agreement entered&nbsp; into by&nbsp; Joseph Gotianuy&nbsp; and Alejo&nbsp;&nbsp; Cababajay, the&nbsp; President&nbsp; of said Cebu Port Labor Union vs. States Marine Co., et al. Union.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the fact that&nbsp; counsel for the other&nbsp; re- spondents&nbsp; called already the attention of the Court that the States Marine Corporation&nbsp; was non-existing and sug- gested that proper substitution&nbsp; or amendment of the peti- tion be&nbsp; made, petitioner-appellee relied on the&nbsp; provision of Section&nbsp; 77 of the Corporation Law in its stand to include the saidcorporation as party respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Section 77 of the&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; Law&nbsp; reads&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows: <br><br><blockquote><br>"Sec.&nbsp; 77.&nbsp; Every&nbsp; corporation whose charter expires by its own limitation or is annulled by forfeiture or&nbsp; otherwise, or whose cor- porate existence for other purposes is terminated in any other man- ner, shall nevertheless be continued&nbsp; as a&nbsp; body&nbsp; corporate for three years after&nbsp; the time when it would have been so dissolved,&nbsp; for the purpose&nbsp; of prosecuting and defending suits by or against it and of enabling it gradually to settle and close its affairs, to dispose of and convey its property and to divide its capital stock,&nbsp; <i>but not for the purpose&nbsp; of continuing&nbsp; the business for which it was established</i>."</blockquote><br><br>Even&nbsp; a&nbsp; cursory&nbsp; reading&nbsp; of the above-quoted&nbsp; provision would convey the idea clearly manifested&nbsp; in the limitation "but&nbsp; not for the purpose&nbsp; of continuing&nbsp; the&nbsp; business for which it was established", that the&nbsp; 3-year period&nbsp; allowed by the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; law&nbsp; is only for the purpose of wmding up its&nbsp; affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner-appellee prayed that it be declared to have the right to the stevedoring&nbsp; work in question "thereby respecting the contract entered into by petitioner and the Blizalde&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; and subsequently&nbsp; enforced and continued&nbsp; by the respondent States&nbsp; Marine&nbsp; Corporation". It&nbsp; appearing that the said States Marine&nbsp; Corporation was already dissolved at the time said petition was&nbsp; filed, and the vessel&nbsp; subject of the agreement having changed hands, it cannot be compelled now to respect such agreement specially considering the fact that it cannot even be made a party to this suit (Sec. 1, Eule 3, of the Rules of Court). <br><br>Appellee,&nbsp; however, contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; it seeks&nbsp; the enforce- ment of the agreement entered into by&nbsp; Joseph Gotianuy as manager of&nbsp; the Royal Lines, Inc.&nbsp; If this is so,&nbsp; We must bear in mind the. provision of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 7 of Rule 3, regarding&nbsp; indispensable parties, and that the Royal Lines, Cebu Port Labor Union vs. States Marin e Co., et al. Inc., has not been made a party to this case.&nbsp; The decision making the award&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petitioner-appellee&nbsp; en- forceable against the&nbsp; States Marine&nbsp; Corporation cannot now be altered to suit&nbsp; appellee's defense by interpreting it to include those who should&nbsp; have been the real parties in interest, after its attention was called by none other than counsel for respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; as stated before, when the Sheriff&nbsp; tried to serve the summons and the writ of preliminary injunction on respondent States Marine Corporation, he found out that this corporation was no longer in existence, a&nbsp; fact which was made to appear on the left side of the Sheriff's return of service of the writ, followed by&nbsp; an&nbsp; illegible countersign&nbsp; which&nbsp; is not&nbsp; even&nbsp; that&nbsp; of Joseph&nbsp; Gotianuy, as stated by Tomas&nbsp; Cabrera, the person in charge of the wharf department of the Royal Lines, Inc. This being so,&nbsp; We&nbsp; fail to understand how the&nbsp; Sheriff of Cebu&nbsp; could&nbsp; have stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; his return of service of said writ that the States Marine&nbsp; Corporation was served copy of the writ&nbsp; and instructed them (all&nbsp; the respondents) to avoid molesting&nbsp; the herein&nbsp; petitioner on their work&nbsp; of loading and unloading&nbsp; of&nbsp; cargoes&nbsp; from M/V&nbsp; Bisayas, unless the Sheriff&nbsp; believed&nbsp; that service of&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; on Pansacala, Tura, Villajas and Regis constituted&nbsp; service thereof on the States Marine Corporation, which is evidently erroneous.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Sheriff&nbsp; must have&nbsp; served&nbsp; the summons and the writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; at the same time upon the respondents and if the writ was not accepted and duly receipted&nbsp; by&nbsp; said&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Corporation,&nbsp; We&nbsp; can reasonably infer that the&nbsp; summons&nbsp; on the latter was likewise not properly&nbsp; served&nbsp; on said&nbsp; party.&nbsp; That is undoubtedly the reason why it did not appear or take part in this controversy and, therefore, it cannot be legally declared&nbsp; in default for lack of appearance as the trial Judge wrongly did&nbsp; in this case.<br><br>After We have come to the&nbsp; foregoing conclusions there seems&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; no need for the&nbsp; determination of the other matters raised&nbsp; by appellants. Cebu Port Labor Union vs. States Marine Co., et al. <br><br>RECAPITULATION—From the foregoing considerations, it appears that the alleged verbal contract between the peti- tioning Union and&nbsp; Elizalde &amp; Co. for the exclusive right of loading and&nbsp; unloading the cargo&nbsp; of&nbsp; the vessel&nbsp; M/V BlSAYAS even if really entered into&nbsp; by said&nbsp; parties, could not give the&nbsp; petitioner any right to&nbsp; exercise the award of said job after the&nbsp; M/V Bisayas was bought by the respondent States Marine Corporation which by no means can be compelled to fulfill the part of said company's contracted obligation to the petitioner.&nbsp; The reasons are obvious, to wit:&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; because&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no&nbsp; sufficient and&nbsp; competent evidence on record to&nbsp; show&nbsp; the&nbsp; life and other conditions of the&nbsp; alleged verbal&nbsp; contract&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into&nbsp; between the petitioner and Elizalde &amp; Co.,&nbsp; nor the authority of the latter's representative to&nbsp; bind&nbsp; his principal; (b) because the&nbsp; States Marine Corporation&nbsp; is&nbsp; not and was not in existence at&nbsp; the time of the institution of this case and has&nbsp; no personality&nbsp; herein, for it has&nbsp; not&nbsp; and could not have been duly and&nbsp; properly&nbsp;&nbsp; summoned;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; because the M/V Bisayas was not,&nbsp; at the time of the&nbsp; institution of this case, the property&nbsp; of&nbsp; the respondent States Marine Corporation but of the Royal Lines, Inc., which&nbsp; changed the&nbsp; name of "Bisayas" to&nbsp; that of "Melliza"; and&nbsp; (d) because the bare testimony&nbsp; of the&nbsp; members of the petitioning Union given in this case&nbsp; cannot overcome the certification of Joseph Gotianuy, General Manager of the Royal&nbsp; Lines, Inc., that&nbsp; the&nbsp; job&nbsp; of&nbsp; loading&nbsp; and unloading the cargo of M/V Melliza waa&nbsp; awarded to the group of laborers&nbsp; headed by respondent&nbsp; Andres Tura. <br><br>Now, if&nbsp; petitioner's complaint has&nbsp; to&nbsp; be dismissed as against respondent&nbsp; States Marine Corporation&nbsp; because it has not been summoned in this case, it has no legal existence nor capacity to sue and be sued, and for lack of evidence to substantiate that it contracted&nbsp; any obligation towards the petitioner, We do not see&nbsp; how the respondent laborers can&nbsp; be&nbsp; compelled to decline or refuse&nbsp; the award that Gotianuy, the&nbsp; General Manager of the Royal Lines, Pangasinati Trans. Co., Inc. et al. vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al. Inc.,&nbsp; granted them in connection with the job&nbsp; of&nbsp; loading and unloading the cargo of the M/V Melliza as shown by the former's certification, and much&nbsp; less to reimburse the members of the petitioning Union&nbsp; the corresponding wages that they would have failed to earn. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from and the&nbsp; permanent&nbsp; writ of injunction&nbsp; ordered to&nbsp; be issued are set aside&nbsp; and judgment&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby rendered&nbsp; dismissing the petition&nbsp; that gave rise to this&nbsp; action, with&nbsp; costs against the petitioner in both instances.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.
