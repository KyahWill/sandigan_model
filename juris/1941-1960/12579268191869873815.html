				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila, dated August 10, 
1955, denying its petition to exclude certain pieces of steel matting from the 
assets of the insolvent M. P. Malabanan; the Board of Liquidators appealed to 
the Court of Appeals. The latter certified the case to this Court on the ground 
that only questions of law are involved.
<p>The Board of Liquidators (hereinafter referred to as the Board) is an agency 
of the Government created under Executive Order No. 372 (November 24, 1950), 
and, pursuant to Executive Order No. 377 (December 1, 1950), took over the 
functions of the defunct Surplus Property Liquidating Committee.</p>
<p>On June 14, 1952 Melecio Malabanan entered into an agreement with the Board 
for the salvage of surplus properties sunk in territorial waters off the 
provinces of Mindoro, La Union, and Batangas (Exhibit "A"). By its terms, 
Malabanan was to commence operations within 30 days from execution of said 
contract, which was to be effective for a period of one (1) year from the start 
of operations, extendible for a total period of not more than six (6) months. On 
June 10, 1953, Malabanan requested for an extension of one (1) year for the 
salvage in waters of Mindoro and Batangas; and the Board extended the contract 
up to November 30, 1953. On November 18, 1953, Malabanan requested a second 
extension of one (1) more year for the waters of Occidental Mindoro, and the 
Board again extended the contract up to August 31, 1954. Malabanan submitted a 
recovery report dated July 26, 1954, wherein it is stated that he had recovered 
a total of 13,107 pieces of steel mattings, as follows:</p>

<td><u>10,552</u></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>13,107 (pieces)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Four months previously, Malabanan had entered into an agreement with Exequiel 
Floro, dated March 31, 1954 (Exhibit 1, Floro), in which, among other things, it 
was agreed that Floro would advance to Malabanan certain sums of money, not to 
exceed P25,000.00, repayment thereof being secured by quantities of steel 
mattings which Malabanan would consign to Floro; that said advances were to be 
paid within a certain period, and upon default at the expiration thereof, Floro 
was authorized to sell whatever steel mattings were in his possession under said 
contract, in an amount sufficient to satisfy the advances. Pursuant thereto, 
Floro claims to have made total advances to the sum of P24,224.50.</p>
<p>It appears that as Malabanan was not able to repay Floro's advances, the 
latter, by a document dated August 4, 1954, sold 11,047 pieces of steel mattings 
to Eulalio Legaspi for the sum of P24,303.40.</p>
<p>Seventeen days later, on August 21, 1954, Malabanan filed in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila a petition for voluntary insolvency, attaching thereto 
a Schedule of Accounts, in which the Board was listed as one of the creditors 
for P10,874.46, and Exequiel Floro for P24,220.50, the origin of the obligations 
being described as "Manila Royalty" and "Salvaging Operations", respectively. 
Also attached was an Inventory of Properties, listing certain items of personal 
property allegedly aggregating P33,707.00 in value. In this list were included 
11,167 pieces of steel mattings with an alleged estimated value of 
P33,501.00.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Board, claiming to be the owner of the listed steel matting, 
filed a petition to exclude them from the inventory; and to make the insolvent 
account for a further 1,940 pieces of steel matting, the difference between the 
number stated in the insolvent's recovery report of July 26, 1954 and that 
stated in the inventory. Exequiel Floro opposed the Board's petition and claimed 
that the steel matting listed had become the property of Eulalio Legaspi by 
virtue of a deed of sale in his favor, executed by Floro pursuant to the 
latter's contract with Malabanan on March 31, 1954. The court below, after 
reception of evidence as to the genuineness and due execution of the deed of 
sale to Legaspi, as well as of the contract between Malabanan and Floro, denied 
the Board's petition, declaring that Malabanan had acquired ownership over the 
steel mattings under his contract with the Board; that Exequiel Floro was 
properly authorized to dispose of the steel mattings under Floro's contract with 
Malabanan; and that the sale to Eulalio Legaspi was valid and not contrary to 
the Insolvency Law.</p>
<p>In this appeal, the Board contends that Malabanan did not acquire ownership 
over the steel mattings due to his failure to comply with the terms of the 
contract, allegedly constituting conditions precedent for the transfer of title, 
namely: payment of the price; audit and check as to the nature, quantity and 
value of properties salvaged; weighing of the salvaged properties to be 
conducted jointly by representatives of the Board and of Malabanan; 
determination of the site for storage; audit and verification of the recovery 
reports by government auditors; and filing of a performance bond. </p>
<p>We are of the opinion, and so hold, that the contract (Exhibit "A") between 
Malabanan and the Board had the effect of vesting Malabanan with title to, or 
ownership of, the steel mattings in question as soon as they were brought up 
from the bottom of the sea. This is shown by pertinent provisions of the 
contract as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"10. For and in consideration of the assignment by the Board of Liquidators 
to the Contractor (Malabanan) of all right, title and interest in and to all 
surplus properties salvaged by the Contractor under this contract, the 
Contractor shall pay to the Government Ninety Pesos (P90.00) per long ton (2,240 
lbs.) of surplus properties recovered. </p>
<p>"11. Payment of the agreed price shall be made monthly during the first ten 
(10) days of every-month on the basis of recovery reports of sunken surplus 
properties salvaged during, the preceding month, duly verified and audited by 
the authorized representative of the Board of Liquidators."</p></blockquote>
<p>That Malabanan was required under the contract to post a bond of P10,000.00 
to guarantee compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract; that the 
operations for salvage were entirely at Malabanan's expense and risks; that 
gold, silver, copper, coins, currency, jewelry, precious stones, etc. were 
excepted from the contract, and were instead required to be turned over to the 
Board for disposition; that the expenses for storage, including guard service, 
were for Malabanan's account—all these circumstances indicated that ownership of 
the goods passed to Malabanan as soon as they were recovered or salvaged (i.e., 
as soon as the salvor had gained effective possession of the goods), and not 
only after payment of the stipulated price.</p>
<p>While there can be reservation of title in the seller until full payment of 
the price (Article 1478, N.C.C.), or, until fulfillment of a condition (Article 
.1605, N.C.C.); and while execution of a public instrument amounts to delivery 
only when from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly be 
inferred (Article 1498, <em>supra</em>), there is nothing in the said contract 
which may be deemed a reservation of title, or from which it, may clearly be 
inferred that delivery was not intended.</p>
<p>The contention that there was no delivery is incorrect; While there was no 
physical tradition, there was one by agreement (traditio <em>longa manu</em>) in 
conformity with Article 1499 of the Civil Code, .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Article 1499</em>—The delivery of movable property may likewise be made 
by the mere consent or agreement of the contracting parties, if the thing sold 
cannot be transferred to the possession of the vendee at the time of the sale. * 
* *"</p></blockquote>
<p>As observed earlier, there is nothing in the terms of the public instrument 
in question from which an intent to withhold delivery or transfer of title may 
be inferred.</p>
<p>The Board also contends that as no renewal of the bond required was filed for 
the extension of the contract, it ceased to have any force and effect; and, as 
the steel mattings were recovered during the extended period of the contract, 
Malabanan did not acquire any rights thereto. The pertinent portion of the 
contract provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"12. Jointly with the execution of this contract, the Contractor shall file a 
bond in the amount of Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos to guarantee his faithful 
compliance with the terms and conditions herein; Provided, that this contract 
shall not be considered to have been executed notwithstanding the signing hereof 
by the parties until said bond" shall have been properly 
filed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Malabanan filed a bond dated June 10, 1952, effective for one (1) year, or up 
to June 10, 1953. The principal contract, executed on June 14, 1952, was first 
extended to November 30, 1953, and finally, to August 31, 1954. As can be seen, 
there was no longer any bond from June 11, 1953 to August 31, 1954.</p>
<p>The lapse of the bond did not extinguish the contract between Malabanan and 
the Board. The requirement that a bond be posted was already complied with when 
Malabanan filed the bond dated June 10, 1952. A bond merely stands as guaranty 
for a principal obligation which may exist independently of said bond, the 
latter being merely an accessory contract (Valencia <em>vs</em>. RFC &amp; C.A., 
103 Phil., 444). Significantly, its purpose, as per the terms of the contract, 
was "to guarantee his (Malabanan's) faithful compliance with the terms and 
conditions herein"; and, for violation of the contract, the Board may declare 
"the bond forfeited" (par. 13). Being for its benefit, the Board could legally 
waive the bond requirement (Valencia <em>vs</em>. RFC, et al., <em>supra</em>.), 
and it did so when, the bond already having expired, it extended the contract 
not only once, but twice. In none of the resolutions extending the contract 
(Annexes "C" &amp; "E", pp. 108-112, Record on Appeal) was there a requirement 
that the bond be renewed, in the face of the first indorsement by the Executive 
Officer of the Board (Annex "F", pp. 112-113, Record on Appeal) recommending 
that Malabanan's request for a second extension be granted "provided the bond be 
originally posted should continue."</p>
<p>There is no merit to the suggestion that there being a novation, Article 1299 
of the Civil Code should govern. Novation is never presumed, it being required 
that the intent to novate be expressed clearly and unequivocally, or that the 
terms of the new agreement be incompatible with the old contract (Article 1292, 
N.C.C.; Martinez <em>vs</em>. Cavives, 25 Phil. 581; Tiu Siuce <em>vs</em>. 
Habana, 45 Phil. 707; Pablo <em>vs</em>. Sapungan, 71 Phil. 145; Young 
<em>vs</em>. Villa, 93 Phil., 21; 49 Off. Gaz., [5] 1818.) Here there was 
neither express novation nor incompatibility from which it could be implied. 
Moreover, a mere extension of the term (period) for payment or performance is 
not novation (Inchausti <em>vs</em>. Yulo, 34 Phil. 978; Zapanta <em>vs</em>. De 
Rotaeche, 21 Phil. 154; Pablo <em>vs</em>. Sapungan, <em>supra</em>) ; and, 
while the extension covered only some of the areas originally agreed upon, this 
change did not alter the essence of the contract (cf. Ramos <em>vs</em>. Gibbon, 
67 Phil., 371; Bank of P.I. <em>vs</em>. Herridge, 47 Phil., 57).</p>
<p>It is next contended that the sale by Floro to Legaspi on August 4, 1954 
(within 30 days prior to petition for insolvency) was void as a fraudulent 
transfer under Section 70 of the Insolvency Law. The court below held that the 
sale to Legaspi was valid and not violative of Section 70; but there having been 
no proceedings to determine whether the sale was fraudulent, we think it was 
premature for the court below to decide this point, especially because under 
section 36, No. 8, of the Insolvency Act, all proceedings to set aside 
fraudulent transfers should be brought and prosecuted by the assignee, who can 
legally represent all the creditors of the insolvent (Maceda, et al., 
<em>vs</em>. Hernandez, et al., 70 Phil., 261). To allow a single creditor to 
bring such a proceeding would invite a multiplicity of suits, since the 
resolution of his case would not bind the other creditors, who may refile the 
same claim independently, with diverse proofs, and possibly give rise to 
contradictory rulings by the courts.</p>
<p>The order appealed from is hereby affirmed in so far as it declares the 
disputed goods to be the property of the insolvent; but without prejudice to the 
right of the assignee in insolvency to take whatever action may be proper to 
attack the alleged fraudulent transfer of the steel matting to Eulalio Legaspi, 
and to make the proper parties account for the difference between the number of 
pieces of steel matting stated in the insolvent's recovery report, Annex "B" 
(13,107), and that stated in his inventory (11,167). Costs against 
appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Bautista Angela, Labrador, Barrera, Gutierrez 
David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order affirmed without prejudice.</em></p></div>
