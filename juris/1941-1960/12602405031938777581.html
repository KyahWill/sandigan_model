				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sometime&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1950, Campos Rueda Corporation&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Manila against Sta. Cruz Timber Co. and Alfonso L. Felix&nbsp; (Civil Case No. 8647)&nbsp; to recover the value of two promissory notes for the amounts of P1.125 and P1.075, executed by&nbsp; defendants jointly and severally on&nbsp; November 23, 1948,&nbsp; and November 30, 1948, respectively.&nbsp; Holding that the&nbsp; two notes&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; two separate causes of&nbsp; action each involving less&nbsp; than&nbsp; P2.000, the Court of First&nbsp; Instance dismissed the case for&nbsp; lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>Subsequently, on February 22, 1952,&nbsp; Campos Rueda Corporation filed another action in&nbsp; the Municipal Court&nbsp; of Manila against the&nbsp; same defendants, Sta. Cruz Timber&nbsp; Co. and&nbsp; Alfonso&nbsp; L., Felix,, for collection of 'the same promissory notes object of the former action.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trial on the merits, the Municipal Court likewise dismissed the action on the ground that the amount of&nbsp; the&nbsp; two notes, which plaintiff consolidated&nbsp; under a single cause of action, was in excess of' its jurisdiction; and on appeal to the Court of First Instance of Manila, the latter&nbsp; Court sustained the dismissal of the action&nbsp; by the Municipal Court.&nbsp; Wherefore, plaintiff brought this appeal directly&nbsp; to&nbsp; this Court. The sole question involved herein is whether or not the Municipal Court of Manila has&nbsp; jurisdiction over the subject-matter of appellant's complaint: the two&nbsp; promissory ¦notes set forth therein, executed on November 23, 1948, and November 30, 1948, and for the amounts of,Pl,125 and Pl,075 respectively.<br><br>The pertinent provisions of the&nbsp; Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended,&nbsp; read:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 44. <i>Original jurisdiction</i>.—Courts&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance shall have&nbsp; original jurisdiction: <br><br>(<i>c</i>) In all cases in which the&nbsp; demand,&nbsp; exclusive of interest,&nbsp; or the value of the property in controversy, amounts to more than two thousand pesos; <br><br>Sec. 88. <i>Original jurisdiction in civil cases</i>.—*&nbsp; * *&nbsp; In all civil actions,&nbsp; including those mentioned in Rules 59 and 62&nbsp; of the Rules of Court,&nbsp; arising&nbsp; in his&nbsp; municipality or city, and not exclusively cognizable by the&nbsp; Court of First Instance, the justice&nbsp; of the peace and&nbsp; the judge of, a municipal court&nbsp; shall have exclusive original jurisdiction "where' the value of the subject-matter or amount of the demand does not exceed&nbsp; two&nbsp; thousand pesos,&nbsp; exclusive of interest and&nbsp; costs. * * *"<br></blockquote>Interpreting the&nbsp; above provisions,&nbsp; we held in the cases of Gutierrez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Kuiz,&nbsp; et al., 50 Off. Gaz., No. G, 2480, and Soriano <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Omila, 51&nbsp; Off. Gaz, No. 7, 3465,&nbsp; that the jurisdiction of a court depends, not upon the value&nbsp; or&nbsp; demand in each single cause of&nbsp; action contained in&nbsp; the complaint, but upon <span style="font-style: italic;">the&nbsp; totality&nbsp; of the demand in all&nbsp; the causes of action.&nbsp;</span> The aggregate amount of the two notes claimed by appellant being P2,200, the. Municipal Court has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of its&nbsp; complaint.<br><br>Some doubt appears to&nbsp; have arisen because in our decision in the case of Go <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Go, (95 Phil.,&nbsp; 378), promulgated June 30, 1954,&nbsp; a distinction&nbsp; was drawn between&nbsp; a claim composed of several accounts arising from' different transactions, and&nbsp; another&nbsp; which is&nbsp; composed&nbsp; of several accounts which arise&nbsp; out of the same&nbsp; amount of each account furnishes the&nbsp; test of jurisdiction while&nbsp; in the second, the jurisdiction is&nbsp; determined by&nbsp; the total amount&nbsp; claimed. This ruling, however, was not&nbsp; followed in the recent case of Soriano <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Omila, supra (citing&nbsp; the&nbsp; earlier case of Gutierrez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Ruiz, also supra), wherein&nbsp; we&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; and categorically stated that "the practice has always been to attend to the total amount demanded in the&nbsp; complaint, especially in the prayer, as determinative .of the jurisdiction of the court", and&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; the action filed in the Municipal&nbsp; Court because&nbsp; the&nbsp; aggregate&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the demand&nbsp; (which arose from different transactions) was P2,700 and so was beyond the&nbsp; jurisdiction of the inferior court.<br><br>After mature deliberation, we have reached the conclusion that the correct&nbsp; and sound interpretation&nbsp; of the Judiciary Act of&nbsp; 1948, which bases the&nbsp; jurisdiction of both the Court&nbsp; of First Instance and the&nbsp; municipal court. on "the amount of the demand"&nbsp; (section 44 [c] and&nbsp; 88), is that made by us in the Soriano <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Omila case: that where there are several claims or causes of action between the same parties embodied in a single complaint, the jurisdiction of the court depends, not upon the value or demand in each single cause of&nbsp; action, but upon the totality of the demand in all the&nbsp; causes of action.&nbsp; In other words, "the amount of the demand"&nbsp; means the&nbsp; total&nbsp; or aggregate amount demanded in" the complaint, irrespective of whether the plural causes&nbsp; of action constituting&nbsp; the&nbsp; total claim arose out of the same, or different transactions.<br><br>This rule not only affords the plaintiff a means to avoid multiplicity of&nbsp; suits&nbsp;&nbsp; (which&nbsp; our&nbsp; rules&nbsp; discourage)&nbsp; but permits him to reduce the number of&nbsp; courts that he must resort to in obtaining relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule, furthermore, appears to be in accord&nbsp; with the weight of American authority, including the Federal courts and those of the State of California&nbsp; from which our own rules&nbsp; of practice and procedure were mainly taken.<br><blockquote>"Where there are several&nbsp; causes&nbsp; of action, each&nbsp; of which for less than the jurisdictional amount, if the aggregate demand is for that amount, a court will have jurisdiction&nbsp; whenever the causes of action are such as can be joined in the same action."&nbsp;&nbsp; (14 Am. Jur. p,&nbsp; 415,&nbsp; section 217)<br><br>"The&nbsp; rule&nbsp; in&nbsp; both the&nbsp; Federal and&nbsp; state&nbsp; courts is that&nbsp; where claims, individually less than the required jurisdictional amount, are aggregated through a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide&nbsp;</span> transfer or&nbsp; assignment,&nbsp; with no intention to&nbsp; convey to the plaintiff a&nbsp; full title&nbsp; and these&nbsp; claims aggregate a sum equal to, or in excess of, the jurisdictional requirement is satisfied and the court has jurisdiction."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Bullard <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cisco (U.S.)&nbsp; (reported&nbsp; herewith)&nbsp; ante,&nbsp; 141;&nbsp; 290 U.S.&nbsp; (Ed,&nbsp; Note,&nbsp; 93 A.L.K.,&nbsp; 148)<br><br>"The&nbsp; rule for determining jurisdiction where&nbsp; several claims have been vested in a single plaintiff by assignment is thus clearing stated in&nbsp; Hammell <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Superior Court, 217&nbsp; Cal.&nbsp; 5, 17 P.&nbsp; (2d) 101,102:<br><br>'While the&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of other states&nbsp; are&nbsp; not in complete&nbsp; accord upon this proposition&nbsp; (15 Cor.' Jur.&nbsp;&nbsp; 788-771,&nbsp; sections&nbsp; 64,&nbsp; 65; 7 R.C.L. 1055, section&nbsp; 91), it has long since been settled in&nbsp; this 'state, that, where separate causes of action, properly&nbsp; joinable are united in&nbsp; a&nbsp; single plaintiff and&nbsp; set forth in&nbsp; a single complaint, the&nbsp; superior&nbsp; court&nbsp; has&nbsp; jurisdiction, to&nbsp; the&nbsp; exclusion,&nbsp; of&nbsp; inferior courts,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the aggregate&nbsp; of the&nbsp; several&nbsp; claims equals or exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of the superior court, although no one of&nbsp; the&nbsp; claims&nbsp; equals&nbsp; such&nbsp; jurisdictional&nbsp; minimum.&nbsp; (Bailey&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

If under&nbsp; the allegations of the complaint&nbsp; the plaintiff is entitled to an amount equal to, or in excess, of,&nbsp; the superior court's jurisdictional minimum, that court has jurisdiction of the&nbsp; cause even though the&nbsp; demand&nbsp; be&nbsp; made up of several component&nbsp; parts. This rule, of necessity,&nbsp; applies only to&nbsp; those cases where&nbsp; the total demand concerns and affects&nbsp; all the parties&nbsp; to&nbsp; the litigation.&nbsp; It is without application to' a suit where several complainants, acting individually and not jointly, are seeking to enforce their respective claims against a&nbsp; single defendant, each claim being&nbsp; less than&nbsp; the&nbsp; jurisdictional minimum.&nbsp; (Winrod&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Wolters, 141&nbsp; Cal.&nbsp; 399,&nbsp; 402, 403,&nbsp; 74 P. 1037;&nbsp; Golla&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Carmichael&nbsp; U-Drive&nbsp;&nbsp; Autos,&nbsp; Inc., Ill&nbsp; Cal.

Sierra Valley,' etc., Ass'n,&nbsp; 122 Cal. 669, 65 P. 689)." (Frost et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Mighctto et al., 71 Pac. Rep. 2d. 932, 934)<br><br>"Respondent's objection that this cause is beyond the jurisdiction of the Superior Court because under $1,000 is without merit because the aggregate of&nbsp; the amounts sued for is well within the jurisdictional amount. 7&nbsp; Cal.&nbsp; Jur. p.&nbsp; 692.&nbsp;&nbsp; The demurrer should be overruled, and the plaintiff should&nbsp; be granted leave to amend&nbsp; if is so advised."&nbsp; (Forster et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

Brent, 2&nbsp; Bed. Supp. 425, citing numerous precedents from the federal district courts, it is stated:<br><blockquote>"There&nbsp; is&nbsp; ample&nbsp; authority to sustain the&nbsp; contention made the plaintiff that the amount of the matter in controversy is determined, not by any one cause of action, but by the aggregate amount of all of the causes of&nbsp; action properly joined in an action at law."<br></blockquote>It thus appears that our&nbsp; ruling in Soriano <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Omila, 51 Off. Gaz. (No.&nbsp; 7). p. 3465,&nbsp; that&nbsp; we now reiterate, has the support of reason and precedent.&nbsp; Of&nbsp; course, where&nbsp; the claims joined are separately owned by,&nbsp; or due to, different parties, the&nbsp; rule will be different and each separate claim furnishes the jurisdictional test.&nbsp; (Argonza et al.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. International Colleges, (90 Phil.,&nbsp; 470) November 29, 1951; Soriano y Cia&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Jose,&nbsp; 47 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; (12 Supp. p. 156) 86 Phil., 523.<br><br>Appellant urges that to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that the Municipal Court has no jurisdiction over&nbsp; this case would result in&nbsp; an absurdity, because the Court of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; had previously&nbsp; declared itself&nbsp; without&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; over&nbsp; the same&nbsp; case&nbsp; (Civil&nbsp; Case No. 8647) and&nbsp; so no court would appear to have jurisdiction to grant appellant relief on its two promissory notes.&nbsp; The&nbsp; fallacy&nbsp; in this&nbsp; argument is that the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila did have jurisdiction to try the first&nbsp; case, and so its dismissal&nbsp; of the action for lack of jurisdiction was an error of law.&nbsp; Such error&nbsp; could have been corrected&nbsp; on appeal,&nbsp; had any of the parties appealed; but appellant&nbsp; chose to abide by&nbsp; the decision of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; and filed its action anew&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Municipal Court&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp; As&nbsp; the latter Court never&nbsp; acquired&nbsp; jurisdiction over&nbsp; this case, however, we are not in a position to&nbsp; grant any relief to appellant on appeal and have no choice but&nbsp; to sustain the dismissal of the action by the Court of First Instance.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, without prejudice to the right&nbsp; of appellant Campos Eueda Corporation&nbsp; to file&nbsp; another&nbsp; complaint for the&nbsp; same cause&nbsp; of action&nbsp; in the court of&nbsp; proper jurisdiction.&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion</i>, and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">BAUTISTA ANGELO, </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">J.</i>, concurring and dissenting:<br><br>I concur in the result because it&nbsp; appears that the two promissory notes herein involved arise&nbsp; out of the&nbsp; same transaction,&nbsp; but I still adhere to the ruling laid down in Alicia&nbsp; Go, et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Alberto&nbsp; Go, et al. 50&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 3031 which&nbsp; I believe to be sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; One wholesome effect of this ruling&nbsp; is that it would&nbsp; forestall any attempt at&nbsp; circumvention of the jurisdiction of inferior courts&nbsp; by joining different&nbsp; accounts in one action&nbsp; even if&nbsp; they arise out of different transactions simply because of the desire to place them within the&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; higher court.&nbsp; This would&nbsp; amount to a deprivation of&nbsp; the jurisdiction of inferior&nbsp; courts by judicial ruling. As it was properly held, "where two or more causes of action are improperly united in one suit&nbsp; the amount involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; the different causes cannot be added together so&nbsp; as&nbsp; to make an amount in controversy&nbsp; sufficient to confer&nbsp; jurisdiction on the court in which&nbsp; the&nbsp; suit&nbsp; is brought&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; ."&nbsp; (21&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; pp. 76-78).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Parás, C.
