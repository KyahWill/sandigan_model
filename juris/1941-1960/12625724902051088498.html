				<H3>GREGORIO FURIA,  PETITIONER, VS. COURT OP  APPEALS, RESPONDENT.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This is an appeal by certiorari under Rule 46 to review a&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals. <br><br>The petitioner was charged in the Court of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; with&nbsp; <i>estafa</i>&nbsp; thru&nbsp; falsification&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; public, official and commercial document in&nbsp; an information filed by the Office of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; (criminal case No. 19102). After trial the Court found him guilty of the crime defined and&nbsp; punished under article 166, in connection with article 315, of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, and&nbsp; sentenced— <br><blockquote>*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; him to suffer an indeterminate penalty&nbsp; of from SIX (6) YEARS of <i>prison correctional</i> to EIGHT&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; YEARS&nbsp; and FOUR MONTHS of <i>prison mayor</i>", to pay a&nbsp; fine of P2,000, to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P384.96, without further subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; one-fourth of the costs.&nbsp; (Annex A.) </blockquote>On appeal,&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Appeals convicted him of <i>estafa</i> through falsification of an official and commercial document, as&nbsp; penalized in&nbsp; article&nbsp; 315, paragraph 3, subsection 2, in connection&nbsp; with articles&nbsp; 172&nbsp; and&nbsp; 48, as&nbsp; amended,&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code,&nbsp; and sentenced him&nbsp; to&nbsp; suffer— <br><blockquote>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; from two&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; years&nbsp; and four&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; months&nbsp; to&nbsp; five&nbsp; (5) years,&nbsp; two (2) months and eight&nbsp; (8)&nbsp; days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>, to pay a fine in the sum of P2,000, to&nbsp; indemnify the&nbsp; offended&nbsp; party in the amount of&nbsp; P384.96,&nbsp; or to suffer the corresponding- subsidiary imprisonment&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of insolvency of&nbsp; both fine and indemnity, to the accessories of the law and to pay in lite first instance&nbsp; 1/4&nbsp; of the costs. (Annex B.) </blockquote>The petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals&nbsp; committed the&nbsp; following&nbsp; errors: <br><blockquote>1. The respondent erred in ignoring entirely the first error assigned by the 'appellant in his brief&nbsp; to the effect that the trial court&nbsp; erred in allowing the prosecution&nbsp; to present evidence&nbsp; in&nbsp; (b) variance with the allegations in&nbsp; the information&nbsp; over the objection of the defense;<br>2. The respondent erred in&nbsp; declaring that the amount of the&nbsp; check in question was paid to the&nbsp; supposed&nbsp; payee;<br>3. The respondent erred&nbsp; in holding the&nbsp; appellant criminally and civilly&nbsp; liable for&nbsp; an&nbsp; alleged misrepresentation&nbsp; to the witnesses, Severino Aznar and Simeon Monzon;<br>4, The respondent erred in finding the appellant guilty as charged;<br>5. The respondent erred in&nbsp; not imposing the minimum&nbsp; of the minimum of the indeterminate&nbsp; penalty; and<br>6. The respondent erred&nbsp; in not&nbsp; granting the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for reconsideration filed by the appellant.</blockquote>The information filed against&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; and his co-defendants&nbsp; is as follows: <br><blockquote>That on&nbsp; or&nbsp; about the&nbsp; 20th of June,&nbsp; 1949, in&nbsp; the city of&nbsp; Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together and helping&nbsp; each other, did&nbsp; then and there&nbsp; wilfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and feloniously defraud one Inés B. Bentoso and/or the Bureau&nbsp; of Posts,&nbsp; a government entity under&nbsp; the Department of Public Works and Communications of the&nbsp; Republic of the Philippines in the follow- ing manner, to wit: the said accused Severino Aznar and Juana Doe, the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; with identity and&nbsp; whereabouts still unknown,&nbsp; having somehow obtained or come into possession of a United&nbsp; States Depository check No. 917,109 dated May 11, 1949 in the amount of P384.96 payable to said Inés&nbsp; B. Bentoso,&nbsp; which is a&nbsp; public,&nbsp; official and<br><br>commercial document in that the same is a written act of the sovereign authority of the United States, a foreign country and recognized&nbsp; as a negotiable instrument by the Mercantile Law,&nbsp; did then and there&nbsp; wilfully, unlawfully and&nbsp; feloniously write, print, imitate and forge&nbsp; or&nbsp; cause to be&nbsp; written, printed,&nbsp; imitated&nbsp; and&nbsp; forged the&nbsp; signature&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Inés&nbsp; E.&nbsp; Bentoso at&nbsp; the back of said check and the said accused Gregorio Furia and&nbsp; Simeon Monzon, the latter&nbsp; an employee in the Manila Post Office who&nbsp; taking&nbsp; advantage of&nbsp; his position&nbsp; thereat he&nbsp; being&nbsp; known to his co-employees&nbsp; in said office who in one way or&nbsp; another has something to do with the&nbsp; cashing of said check,&nbsp; signed their signatures at&nbsp; the back&nbsp; of said check as identifiers&nbsp; thereof, thus causing&nbsp; it to appear&nbsp; that&nbsp; the said&nbsp; Ines B. Bentoso duly signed&nbsp; said&nbsp; U. S.&nbsp; Depository check&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 917,109&nbsp; and that she (Inés B. Bentoso)&nbsp; took part&nbsp; in the transaction, although they knew&nbsp; she&nbsp; did not, thereby making&nbsp; untruthful statements in the narration of facts;&nbsp; that&nbsp; as soon as said U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Depository check No.&nbsp; 917,109 had been' falsified&nbsp; in the&nbsp; manner just described, the said accused, with intent&nbsp; to profit&nbsp; thereby and in furtherance of their conspiracy introduced the&nbsp; said accused Juana&nbsp; Doe&nbsp; as&nbsp; the real Inés B,&nbsp; Bentoso&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; teller&nbsp; of the Postal&nbsp; Savings&nbsp; Bank who wanted her check to be&nbsp; cashed, as in&nbsp; fact&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; check was cashed for the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P384.96,&nbsp; they (all&nbsp; of&nbsp; them)&nbsp; knowing fully well&nbsp; that the said check&nbsp; had not been signed by the payee thereof,&nbsp; Inés&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Bcntoso,&nbsp; neither has&nbsp; she authorized&nbsp; anyone&nbsp; of them to act for her, and it is only a forgery; and the said&nbsp; accused, once in possession of said cash amount&nbsp; of P384.96,&nbsp; did then and there wilfully,&nbsp; unlawfully&nbsp; and&nbsp; feloniously misappropriate,&nbsp; misapply and&nbsp; convert the said&nbsp; amount to their own personal&nbsp; use and benefit, to the damage and&nbsp; prejudice of&nbsp; said Inés B. Bentoso&nbsp; and/or the Bureau of&nbsp; Posts&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned sum of P384.96, Philippine currency.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Annex A.) </blockquote>Both the trial&nbsp; and&nbsp; appellate courts found that— <br><blockquote>Sometime on June&nbsp; 21, 1949,&nbsp; Grogorio Furia, an&nbsp; employee of the Investigation Section&nbsp; of the Manila Health Department, City Hall, Manila, approached his co-employee&nbsp; Severino Aznar and introduced him&nbsp; to a woman&nbsp; whom he Referred&nbsp; to as Ines Bentoso,&nbsp; allegedly a townmate of his.&nbsp; Furia also told Aznar&nbsp; that this woman was the payee of check No. 917107 (ExJis. A &amp; A-1)&nbsp; and that he&nbsp; wanted him&nbsp; Aznar) to help&nbsp; said woman in cashing said check. Knowing somebody in the&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of Posts, Aznar accompanied&nbsp;&nbsp; Furia and the alleged&nbsp; Inés Bentoso to that&nbsp; bureau&nbsp; and&nbsp; there he sought&nbsp; Simeon Monzon, an employee&nbsp; of the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Posts,&nbsp; and introduced Furia as his officemate&nbsp; and the&nbsp; woman who went&nbsp; with them&nbsp; as&nbsp; Inés<br><br>Bentoso, the payee of the check.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; convince Aznar and Monzon&nbsp; of&nbsp; the true identity&nbsp; of Inés&nbsp; Bentoso,&nbsp; they&nbsp; presented a residence&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; wherein the name&nbsp; "Ines Bentoso," of Agusan province,&nbsp; appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Forthwith Monzon&nbsp; asked&nbsp; Aznar&nbsp; to sign&nbsp; the back&nbsp; of&nbsp; the check and&nbsp; afterwards he&nbsp; himself signed it also and then&nbsp; accompanied the group&nbsp; to the window of&nbsp; the paying teller. There the&nbsp; full amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the check,&nbsp; P384.96,&nbsp; was&nbsp; paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; the woman (Exhs. A &amp; A-1).<br><br>It also appears that&nbsp; Ines B. Eentoso,&nbsp; 38 years of age, widow, teacher and a resident&nbsp; of Mambalili, Agusan,&nbsp; was a&nbsp; war damage claimant&nbsp; with card&nbsp; No. 100386&nbsp; of the&nbsp; U.S.-Phil. War&nbsp; Damage Commission'and&nbsp; that the check in question was&nbsp; intended by said Commission to satisfy her claim (Exh.&nbsp; B.)&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she&nbsp; did not receive the&nbsp; check and neither&nbsp; did she&nbsp; affix&nbsp; her&nbsp; signature&nbsp; thereon or authorized anyone to do so&nbsp; for&nbsp; her, and&nbsp; she is positive that she does not know Severino Aznar&nbsp; nor&nbsp; Simeon Monzon. <br><br>Because&nbsp; of these&nbsp; facts Severino Aznarj Gregorio Furia,&nbsp; Simeon Monzon and Juana Doe&nbsp; were accused&nbsp; of estafa&nbsp; through falsification of a&nbsp; public and&nbsp; commercial&nbsp; document&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; but upon motion of the Fiscal, Severino Aznar and&nbsp; Simeon Monzon were&nbsp; discharged from the&nbsp; information&nbsp; to be utilized as&nbsp; witnesses for the State.&nbsp; And as Juana Doe was&nbsp; never arrested nor identified, the&nbsp; case proceeded only as against Gregorio Furia who,&nbsp; after proper proceedings, "was&nbsp; found guilty of the&nbsp; crime charged in the information and&nbsp; sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of&nbsp; from 6 years of <i>prision&nbsp; correctional</i>&nbsp; to 8&nbsp; years&nbsp; and 4 months of <i>prision mayor</i>, to pay a fine&nbsp; of P2,000, to indemnify the offended party in the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P384.96,&nbsp; without&nbsp; subsidiary&nbsp; im- prisonment&nbsp; in case of insolvency, and to pay 'A ' of the&nbsp; costs-. <br><br>Not satisfied with&nbsp; this decision Gregorio Furia brought the matter up to us on appeal and in this&nbsp; instance his counsel assigns numerous errors as committed&nbsp; by the trial court, all&nbsp; of&nbsp; which having&nbsp; to do either with&nbsp; the appreciation&nbsp; of the evidence against&nbsp; appellant or in finding him guilty and sentencing him to the&nbsp; penally aforementioned instead of&nbsp; acquitting him at least on reasonable doubt.<br><br>There is no dispute that&nbsp; the&nbsp; check for P384.96&nbsp; (Exhs. A &amp; A-1) was intended for Mrs. Ines B.&nbsp; Bentoso in payment of her aforementioned war&nbsp; damage&nbsp; claim, and&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no question either&nbsp; that she has not signed, nor authorized anybody to sign said check and collect for her the amount&nbsp; represented therein, nor in any way intervened in the cashing of&nbsp; said check.&nbsp; The only&nbsp; facts subject of controversy are&nbsp; appellant's denial of having&nbsp; accompanied the&nbsp; woman&nbsp; posing herself as Ines Bentoso to the Manila Post Office in cashing&nbsp; the check, and&nbsp; of having&nbsp;&nbsp; assured Severino Aznar and&nbsp; Simeon Monzon that the woman with him, whose signature appears at the back of check No. 917107, was Inés Bentoso.&nbsp; He contends that on June 20, 1949, a townmate of his, by the namei of Venancio, Sianteng,&nbsp; approached him in his office together with a woman who was introduced&nbsp; to him as Inés Bentoso; that Sianteng requested him to help them&nbsp; so that his woman companion would cash her check;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he, in turn, accompanied them to Severino Aznar,&nbsp; an officemate of appellant, and asked the former&nbsp; to extend to Sianteng and&nbsp; the woman a helping hand; that Aznar promised him that he&nbsp; would try his best, after which the trio left for the Bureau&nbsp; of Posts<br><br>After due consideration of&nbsp; the evidence produced, We find that the version of the case, as narrated by appellant, is utterly untenable. It appears on record&nbsp; that before contacting&nbsp; Aznar appellant had already accompanied the&nbsp; supposed payee to&nbsp; the Bureau of Posts but was not able to cash&nbsp; the&nbsp; check&nbsp; in question because he did not know anybody in said office, and appellant's bare statement&nbsp; cannot prevail over the testimony of Simeon Monzon and&nbsp; Severino Aznar who&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; was present in&nbsp; the Bureau of Posts when&nbsp; the&nbsp; check in question was cashed.&nbsp; If appellant's&nbsp; contention about the intervention of&nbsp; Sianteng were true, it would be strange that ho would&nbsp; not have presented this man&nbsp; as a witness in his&nbsp; behalf,&nbsp;&nbsp; or made&nbsp; him&nbsp; to be called&nbsp; by the authorities,&nbsp; and We entertain no doubt that appellant was the mastermind who engineered the whole&nbsp; scheme to defraud either Inés&nbsp; E. Bentoso or the Government. Consequently, We cannot declare&nbsp; that the lower&nbsp; court committed any error in finding&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; guilty of the crime he is&nbsp; charged with&nbsp; in the information. </blockquote>True,&nbsp; contrary to what is alleged in the information, the m ,&nbsp; trial&nbsp; and the appellate&nbsp; courts&nbsp; found that the petitioner&nbsp; did not&nbsp; sign on the back&nbsp; of the check in question to identify the&nbsp; signature of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fictitious woman as payee, but that he&nbsp; approached his co-employee Severino Aznar, introduced to&nbsp; him&nbsp; the fictitious woman as the payee of the check, and&nbsp; enlisted Aznar a help to cash&nbsp; the check, who introduced her to Simeon Monzon, an employee of&nbsp; the Bureau of Posts, who in turn accompanied&nbsp; her to the window of the paying teller.&nbsp; It was Monzon and Aznar who signed the check to identify the signature of the payee upon the petitioner's&nbsp; assurance&nbsp; that the&nbsp; fictitious&nbsp; woman&nbsp; was the&nbsp; payee and that the signature written on the check was hers.<br><br>Nevertheless, although the evidence for the prosecution is at variance with the fact alleged in the information that the petitioner together with Simeon Monzon signed on the back of the check to identify the signature of the fictitious payee, yet as the information charges conspiracy between the defendants to commit the crime,&nbsp; the evidence for the prosecution&nbsp; to show and prove such&nbsp; conspiracy could not be objected&nbsp; to and the overruling of the objection is not a reversible error.&nbsp; Had it not been&nbsp; for the introduction hj the petitioner of the fictitious woman to his officemate Severino Aznar&nbsp; who&nbsp; was&nbsp; assured by the&nbsp; petitioner that the fictitious woman was Inés B.&nbsp; Bentoso and&nbsp; the&nbsp; payee of the check, neither Aznar nor Monzon would have signed on the back of the check to identify&nbsp; the signature of the fictitious woman as payee.&nbsp; The identification of the&nbsp; latter and of her signature made possible the cashing of the&nbsp; check and the misappropriation of the amount by the petitioner and the fictitious woman&nbsp; other than&nbsp; the real payee.<br><br>The crime committed is the complex crime&nbsp; of <i>estafa</i> by&nbsp; means of&nbsp; falsification&nbsp; of&nbsp; an official and commercial document denned&nbsp; and penalized in articles 315 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The penalty provided for the more&nbsp; serious crime is&nbsp; <i>prision correctional</i> in its medium and maximum periods which must be&nbsp; imposed in its maximum&nbsp; period pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; article 48 of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, as amended, or from 4 years, 9 months and 11 days to 6 years of <i>prision correctional</i>; and&nbsp; applying the&nbsp; Indeterminate Sentence Law the petitioner&nbsp; is sentenced to suffer a minimum&nbsp; of 4&nbsp; months and 1 day of <i>arresto mayor</i> and a maximum of 6 years of prison correctional.&nbsp; Modified as to&nbsp; penalty only the rest of the judgment appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.
