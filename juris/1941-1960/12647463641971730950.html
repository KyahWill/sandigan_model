				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by the prosecution from an order of the Court of First Instance of Marinduque, in Criminal Case No. 1630 thereof,&nbsp; setting&nbsp; aside its judgment of&nbsp; conviction based&nbsp; on the defendant's plea of guilty,&nbsp; and granting a new trial.<p></p><p>It appears that when&nbsp; Criminal Case No. 1630 for slander by&nbsp; deed was&nbsp; called&nbsp; for&nbsp; trial&nbsp; in&nbsp; the court&nbsp; below, appellee appeared without&nbsp; counsel because he could not afford to pay the services&nbsp; of&nbsp; a lawyer.&nbsp; Thereupon, the trial court&nbsp; appointed for him a&nbsp; public defender.&nbsp; Upon the latter's&nbsp; advice, appellee entered a plea of guilty; and on the basis of such plea, the trial court rendered judgment&nbsp; finding&nbsp; him&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime charged&nbsp; and sentencing him accordingly. A week later, appellee moved to set&nbsp; aside the judgment of conviction, to withdraw his plea of guilt and substitute it with one&nbsp; of not guilty, and for a trial on the merits, which motion the Court granted. Not&nbsp; agreeable with the withdrawal of appellee's plea and&nbsp; the new trial,&nbsp; the fiscal&nbsp; appealed. </p><p>We agree&nbsp; with appellee that the order in question is not appealable. </p><p>Under section 1 of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 118,&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court, only final judgments or orders&nbsp; may&nbsp; be appealed from; that is, such judgments or&nbsp; orders that completely dispose of the cause so that no further questions affecting the merits remain for adjudication (II Moran,&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of Court [1952 ed.], p. 880).&nbsp; The order appealed from allows the withdrawal&nbsp; of the defendant's&nbsp; plea of guilt,&nbsp; sets aside the judgment of conviction, and orders a new trial.&nbsp; Far from disposing the cause on the merits,&nbsp; this order reopens the case and grants&nbsp; a&nbsp; new&nbsp; hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like an&nbsp; order over ruling a motion to quash the information, it leaves further proceedings to be done in the&nbsp; trial court, and is&nbsp; therefore interlocutory and unappealable (<em>cf</em>. People vs. Virola and Alia, 97&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 759;&nbsp; People vs. Manuel, L-6794-95, August y,&nbsp; 1954).</p><p>The Solicitor&nbsp; General claims&nbsp; that the evidence&nbsp; sought to be presented by the accused at&nbsp; the new trial—which is the testimony of a witness who&nbsp; avers that the accused slapped the complainant&nbsp; because the latter&nbsp; abused him in public (Original&nbsp; Records,&nbsp; p. 58)—is&nbsp; only cumulative to the plea&nbsp; of guilty and would not change the result of the case.&nbsp; Assuming such claim to be correct, the state would&nbsp; suffer no&nbsp; substantial damage or prejudice&nbsp; by the new hearing, because&nbsp; it would&nbsp; also result in the defendant's conviction.&nbsp; If,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence intended to&nbsp; be presented by the accused is of such materiality as to prove his innocence,&nbsp; then&nbsp; the interests of justice demand that he&nbsp; be allowed to&nbsp; change his plea of guilt and prove his innocence&nbsp; by such evidence.&nbsp; In any&nbsp; case, it is discretionary&nbsp; with the trial court to allow a change of plea after judgment&nbsp; (section 5, Rule 114), and&nbsp; the appellate court will not interfere with such&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; in the absence of&nbsp; abuse.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the order appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs <em>de oficio</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
