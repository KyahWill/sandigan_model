				<H3>ANG LIN CHI, PETITIONER, VS. OSCAR CASTELO, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, VALENTIN TECH, PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF RIZAL, AND GENARO S. PAZ, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition to annul the order of the respondent judge 
directing the issuance of a writ of execution against Jose Ang and the 
petitioner Ang Lin Chi for P1,800 jointly and severally.
<p align="justify">It appears that in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, in 
civil case No. 181 Genaro S. Paz vs. Jose Ang, et al., the Honorable Oscar 
Castelo, Judge, rendered on June 30, 1948, a decision, the dispositive part of 
which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"En su virtud se dicta sentencia ordenando a los demandados 
Jose Ang y Ang Lin Chi devuelvan al aqui demandante dicho automovil, o en su 
defecto la cantidad de mil ochocientos (P1,800) pesos, con las costas a cargo de 
dichos demandados."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">That decision having become final, a writ of execution was 
issued by the clerk on August 21, 1948. It turned out that the automobile was 
entirely useless, and the sheriff so reported. Whereupon the attorney for the 
plaintiff Genaro S. Paz asked for another writ "ordering the defendants Jose Ang 
and Ang Lin Chi to pay jointly and severally to plaintiff the value of the 
automobile in question, in accordance with the decision promulgated" in the 
case. The defendants' attorney objected to the motion on two grounds, the second 
of which maintained that their liability under the judgment was only joint—not 
solidary. The motion was heard, and on September 18, 1948, the court directed 
the issuance of a new writ "ordenando a los demandados Jose Ang y Ang Lin Chi 
para que paguen mancomunada y solidariamente al demandante Genaro Paz la suma de 
P1,800 como precio del automovil en cuestion". A motion for reconsideration was 
denied. Hence this special civil action hurriedly instituted because the 
sheriff, pursuant to the order, had attached real properties of petitioner for 
sale on execution. At the petitioner's request an injunction was issued by this 
Court on October 11, 1948, to prevent the carrying out of the aforesaid judicial 
directive.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner's case is clearly meritorious. The tenor of the writ 
of execution may not vary the terms of the judgment it seeks to enforce. In 
decreeing that Jose Ang and Ang Lin Chi shall pay the sum of P1,800 the original 
judgment did not specify that they shall do it solidarily. Under the law the 
liability thus imposed on defendants was joint (mancomunada). After that 
judgment had become final, the court had no power to amend it to convert 
defendants' liability into a solidary obligation. Much less could it issue an 
order of execution charging the defeated parties with solidary responsibility 
the latter having possibly chosen not to appeal in view of the joint obligation 
(not solidary) declared by the decision.</p>
<p align="justify">Our views in Contreras, vs. Felix, (78 Phil., 570) are quite 
decisive of this litigation.</p>
<p align="justify">This Court in that case rendered judgment the dispositive part 
of which was in these words and phrases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"For all the foregoing, the deed of mortgage dated November 8, 
1930, is declared null and void as to the one-half of the mortgaged property 
belonging to Jerusalem Gingco and rescinded as to the remaining one-half 
belonging to the spouses Molina, and the appealed decision is modified by 
ordering all the defendants to pay Jerusalem Gingco the amount of P30 monthly 
from September 4, 1934, to September 4, 1941, and to continue paying the same 
monthly amount thereafter until the two new doors of the accesoria in question 
are delivered to said Jerusalem Gingco. The defendants shall also pay the filing 
fees of the complaint in the lower court and the costs in both 
instances".</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defendants were the China Banking Corporation, Juan B. 
Molina and his wife. On execution proceedings in the Manila court of first 
instance the Honorable Alfonso Felix, Judge, declared that under the judgment 
the Bank's liability was only one-third. Upon a suit for mandamus, we sustained 
his view saying in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"There is no dispute, and it can be said with confidence, that 
the China Banking Corporation's liability under the terms of the judgment of 
this court is merely joint, joint in the sense in which the word is understood 
in the civil law. 'It is already a well-settled doctrine in this jurisdiction 
that, when it is not provided in a judgment that the defendants are liable to 
pay jointly and severally a certain sum of money, none of them may be compelled 
to satisfy in full said judgment'. (Oriental Commercial Co. Inc. vs. Abeto and 
Mabanag, 60 Phil., 723, citing De Leon vs. Nepomuceno and De Jesus, 37 Phil., 
180, and Sharuff vs. Tayabas Land Co. and Ginainati, 37 Phil., 655). That ruling 
is in entire harmony with arts. 1137 and 1133 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p align="justify">"Under that doctrine the lower court has no legal authority 
under any circumstances to make the change sought by the plaintiffs; and this 
court itself may not make the change after the judgment has become executory. 
According to that decision a mistake such as that here alleged, if it be a 
mistake, is not clerical; it goes to the very substance of the controversy.</p>
<p align="justify">"Only clerical errors, or mistakes or omissions plainly due to 
inadvertence or negligence may be corrected or supplied after the judgment has 
been entered."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Respondents, however, maintain that Judge Castelo did nothing 
more than to clarify his decision as was done and approved in Lacson vs. 
Paredes, 63 Phil., 87. But the facts in that precedent are distinguishable from 
those presently before us, because there it was obvious that the omission of the 
word "severally" from the dispositive part of the judgment was an inadvertence, 
"the parties as well as the trial judge" having understood all the time that the 
obligation was joint and several; whereas here the petitioner disclaimed any 
obligation to the respondent Genaro S. Paz, and there is no positive indication 
in the original decision that the intention of His Honor was to impose a joint 
and several liability.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the disputed order is hereby set aside, and the 
injunction heretofore issued is made permanent. Petitioner will have costs. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, 
JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p>Briones, <i>M., </i>Conforme con la parte dispositiva.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p>PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">Aside from the views we have expressed in Contreras vs. Felix, 
L-884,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> there are other strong reasons 
to deny the petition. Upon the facts on record, it appears that Ang Lin Chi is 
the father of Jose Ang, with whom he appears to be, guilty, of imposture, in 
relation with fradulent maneuvers, regarding the automobile in question. Said 
Jose Ang has been investigated for forgery in relation with the same automobile. 
As declared by the trial court, the automobile in question was seen, after 
liberation, by the owner in the possession, of Jose Ang. A police officer of 
Manila took possession of the automobile as involved in a criminal action for 
falsification against Jose Ang. But the Court of First Instance of Manila 
dismissed the information, because the Jose Ang that appeared as such before the 
investigator Vicente Ilagan, Chief of Division of Automobile, Bureau of Public 
Works and Communication, was in fact petitioner Ang Lin Chi.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the facts on record, there cannot be any question as to 
the solidarity between Jose Ang and Ang Lin Chi and as to the solidarity of 
their obligation to return the automobile to the owner Genaro S. Paz and, 
failing thereof, to indemnify, him in the sum of P1,800.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner Ang Lin Chi being one of the principals in the 
fraudulent and criminal maneuvers to deprive the owner of his automobile cannot 
now hide behind an insubstantial technicality so as to elude the corresponding, 
civil liability.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition, should be denied as, otherwise, is tantamount to 
rewarding fraud.</p>
