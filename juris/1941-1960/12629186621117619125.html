				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari to review an order of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila. 
<p>It appears that respondent Gabriela de Leon Vda. de Mendoza brought suit for 
unlawful detainer in the municipal court of Manila against Julian Sogueco to 
recover the possession of a house, back rents at P80.00 a month for November and 
December, 1946, and compensation for the use and occupation of the premises at 
the rate of P200 monthly from January 1, 1947. On February 6, 1947, the 
municipal court gave judgment for the plaintiff granting all the reliefs prayed 
for except that the last item—compensation for the use of the house from January 
1, 1947—was reduced to P100. Having appealed from that decision to the Court of 
First Instance, the Honorable Felipe Natividad, Judge, acting upon a motion of 
the plaintiff required the defendant, now petitioner, to file a bond of Pl,000 
as a condition for the stay of execution of the judgment. The defendant took 
exception to this order contending, on the authority of Mitschiener <em>vs</em>. 
Barrios, L-112, 42 Off. Gaz., 1901, that the deposit by him of the rents and 
compensation adjudged by the court makes such a bond unnecessary. </p>
<p>The Mitschiener decision controls the case at bar. The only difference 
pointed out between the two cases is that here, the monthly compensation for the 
use and detention of the house after January 1, 1947, demanded by the lessor has 
been reduced, a diminution which, it. is contended, is an item of lawful and 
recoverable damages in this jurisdiction. Under the rule laid down in the case 
of Mitschiener, the reduction is immaterial. This Court said in that case that 
to stay execution of the decision the defendant is only required to pay or 
deposit the current rents as they fall due. It was held that "the supersedeas 
bond * * * has in effect, the purpose of securing only the payment of rents in 
arrears." The Court stated that there are practically no damages "to be 
adjudicated except the loss of rents or their equivalent", and that "the 
deposits made by petitioner of the back rents * * * may have taken the place of 
the supersedeas bond." </p>
<p>The order complained of is set aside with costs against the respondent 
Gabriela de Leon Vda. de Mendoza. </p><em>Feria, Pablo, </em>and <em>Perfecto, 
JJ.,</em> concur. </div>
