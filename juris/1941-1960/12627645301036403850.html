				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Certiorari to reverse&nbsp; an order&nbsp; issued by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Misamis&nbsp; Occidental,&nbsp; Hon. Patricio C. Ceniza, presiding, granting relief from a judgment against respondents Pedro&nbsp; Calapis and&nbsp; Crispulo Calapis, in civil case No. 1373 of the said&nbsp; court, entitled Feliciano V. Delgado&nbsp; vs. Crispulo Calapis and Pedro&nbsp; Calapis.&nbsp; Ground&nbsp; for certiorari is that the petition for relief from judgment was filed by respondents after&nbsp; six months from&nbsp; the day they were&nbsp; notified&nbsp; of the decision rendered against&nbsp; them.<br><br>The record&nbsp; shows that the action&nbsp; was filed on May 20, 1951&nbsp; by plaintiff to&nbsp; recover possession of a parcel&nbsp; of land with&nbsp; damages.&nbsp; Defendants&nbsp; answered the complaint,&nbsp; alleging as special defense that they are owners of the land subject of the action and had been occupying it as&nbsp; owners peacefully,&nbsp; continuously and adversely&nbsp; against&nbsp; the whole world from 1931.&nbsp; After repeated postponements, the case was again called for hearing on February 18, 1955.&nbsp; The clerk of court sent notices of the hearing&nbsp; by&nbsp; registered mail, but the&nbsp; letters containing&nbsp; the notices were returned to&nbsp; the clerk of court "unclaimed," in spite of the&nbsp; fact that three registry notices&nbsp; to&nbsp; the addressees have been sent by the postmaster.&nbsp; The hearing took&nbsp; place without the presence of defendants or their counsel.&nbsp; After hearing the court rendered a&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; declaring plaintiff&nbsp; entitled to the possession of the land and ordering defendants to&nbsp; vacate the same, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the plaintiff the sum&nbsp; of P1,800 as&nbsp; damages, plus&nbsp; P300, as attorney's&nbsp; fees,&nbsp; plus costs.&nbsp; Copies&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment were&nbsp; sent&nbsp; by&nbsp; registered mail to&nbsp; each&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants,&nbsp; and&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; the affidavit&nbsp; of the postmaster&nbsp; the&nbsp; letters were received by Isidoro Calapis, son of Pedro Calapis,&nbsp; who signed for&nbsp; the addressees (see Annex J,&nbsp; Petition).<br>&nbsp;<br>On January 19, 1956,&nbsp; defendants filed a petition&nbsp; for relief from judgment, alleging that they have&nbsp; not been notified of the trial of the case, nor of the decision&nbsp; rendered therein, and alleging further that they have a good&nbsp; and&nbsp; meritorious defense.&nbsp; Motion&nbsp; was supported by&nbsp; affidavits and executed by both defendants.&nbsp; This motion&nbsp; was heard at a time when a motion to&nbsp; declare defendants&nbsp; for contempt was&nbsp; being heard and jointly with said motion for contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both parties were heard in argument, after which the court rendered the order&nbsp; appealed from, setting aside the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; motion for reconsideration&nbsp; was presented by the plaintiff, but same was denied. The pivotal fact upon which&nbsp; the&nbsp; resolution of the petition depends is the validity of the&nbsp; service of the decision made upon the&nbsp; defendants.&nbsp; According to the record,&nbsp; copies of the decision were sent by&nbsp; registered mail&nbsp; to&nbsp; the defendants, in&nbsp; this manner. <br><blockquote>"To Whom It May&nbsp; Concern: <br>&nbsp;<br>This is&nbsp; to certify&nbsp; that&nbsp; according to our records, this Office&nbsp; has received, for transmission&nbsp; to the respective addressees, the following registered letters,&nbsp; to wit: <br>&nbsp;<br>1. Registered letter No. 2174, addressed to Mr.&nbsp; Crispulo Calapis, Mabini, Baliangao, Misamls Occidental, and sent by the Office of the Clerk of Court, Oroquieta, Misamis Occ.;<br><br>2. Registered letter No. 217S,&nbsp; addressed&nbsp; to&nbsp; Mr. Pedro&nbsp; Calapis, Mabini, Baliangao, MIsamis Occidental, and sent by the Office of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clerk&nbsp; of Court,&nbsp; Oroquieta,&nbsp; Misamis&nbsp; Occ. <br><br>It is&nbsp; certified further, that according to our records, said letters were received by the addressees on March 28, 1955, through Isidoro Calapis, son of Pedro Calapis, who signed for&nbsp; the addressees. <br><br>This&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; is issued&nbsp; after&nbsp; proper permission&nbsp; was granted by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of Posts&nbsp; in connection with&nbsp; Civil Case No. 1373, Court of First Instance of this province,&nbsp; entitled 'Feliciano V. Delgado vs. Crispulo Calapis, et al.,'' and through the written&nbsp; request of the sender, the Clerk of&nbsp; Court. <br><br><div style="margin-left: 280px;">(Sgd.)&nbsp; Buenaventura Arcede <br></div><div style="margin-left: 360px;"><i>Postmaster</i></div></blockquote>Under section&nbsp; 7 of Rule 27, judgments must be served personally or&nbsp; by registered&nbsp; mail.&nbsp; Proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; service&nbsp; by registered&nbsp; mail&nbsp; is made in the following manner: <br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 10. <i>Proof of service</i>.â€”Proof of personal service shall consist of a written admission of the&nbsp; party served, or the affidavit of the party serving, containing&nbsp; a&nbsp; full&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the date, place and manner&nbsp; of the service.&nbsp; If the service is by mail, proof thereof shall consist&nbsp; of an&nbsp; affidavit of the person&nbsp; mailing, together with&nbsp; the registry receipt issued&nbsp; by the&nbsp; mailing office if the&nbsp; letter has been registered.&nbsp; The registry return card shall be filed immediately upon receipt thereof by the sender, or in&nbsp; lieu thereof the letter unclaimed together with the certified&nbsp; or sworn&nbsp; copy of the notice given by&nbsp; the postmaster to&nbsp; addressee,"&nbsp; (Rule 27.)</blockquote> Tested by&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-quoted provision,&nbsp; We find&nbsp; that the service of the judgment rendered in the&nbsp; case suffers from two defects, namely, there is&nbsp; no affidavit of the clerk&nbsp; of court, the person mailing,&nbsp; and there is no registry return card, or a certified&nbsp; or sworn copy of the notice given by the postmaster&nbsp; to the addressee.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also appears that the delivery of the letter (containing the decision) to&nbsp; Isidoro Calapis was not made in accordance with the practice followed by the Bureau of Posts&nbsp; in such&nbsp; cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice is for the notice of the registered letter to be sent or given to&nbsp; the&nbsp; addressee,&nbsp; and&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; addressee, in case&nbsp; he does not receive the&nbsp; registered&nbsp; letter himself, to authorize,&nbsp; in writing upon the notice received, the postmaster to&nbsp; deliver the&nbsp; letter to another&nbsp; person&nbsp; designated&nbsp; therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not appear that this practice&nbsp; was followed; it does not appear that the original&nbsp; notice was&nbsp; received&nbsp; by the addressees,&nbsp; or that they had&nbsp; authorized Isidoro Calapis to receive the letters containing the decision for them. <br><br>While there may be a presumption&nbsp; that Isidoro Calapis, in the ordinary course of&nbsp; events,&nbsp; delivered the&nbsp; letters containing the decision to the addressees, the fact of receipt by them is denied by defendants in their&nbsp; answer.&nbsp; From the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the court setting&nbsp; aside the judgment,&nbsp; which found the petition for relief well-founded, we gather that the&nbsp; judge was impressed and convinced&nbsp; by&nbsp; defendants' claim that they did not receive&nbsp; copies of the decision from Isidoro Calapis, for&nbsp; which&nbsp; reason he granted the relief prayed for.&nbsp; There being no reason for changing this "finding, we conclude that the&nbsp; defendants had&nbsp; not&nbsp; Actually received copies of the decision of the court. <br><br>Two other&nbsp; important issues&nbsp; remain to&nbsp; be&nbsp; determined, which are, was the motion&nbsp; for relief filed within six months from entry of judgment as provided in Section 3 of Rule 38, and presented&nbsp; within sixty days from notice of such judgment?&nbsp; The decision was&nbsp; rendered on February 18, 1955 and the court ordered&nbsp; service&nbsp; of the decision&nbsp; on the defendants&nbsp; by registered mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision was&nbsp; actually sent by registered mail to defendants on March 18, 1955 but as pointed out above service was not made in&nbsp; accordance with the&nbsp; Rules.&nbsp; There appears nothing in the record to show when the judgment was actually entered.&nbsp; In accordance with section 2 of Rule 35,&nbsp; entry is made by&nbsp; the clerk (by notation&nbsp; in the book&nbsp; of entries of judgments) if&nbsp; no appeal or motion for new trial&nbsp; is filed within&nbsp; the time provided&nbsp; (30&nbsp; days).&nbsp; While, as petitioner contends, more than nine months elapsed&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; sending&nbsp; of&nbsp; the notice of the decision on March 18, 1955 and the&nbsp; filing of the&nbsp; petition for relief, there is&nbsp; no positive&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; or assurance&nbsp; that the entry&nbsp; was&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the clerk in the ordinary&nbsp; course of business,&nbsp; especially in view&nbsp; of the fact that the court granted the motion for relief.<br><br>As to the date when defendants actually learned of the decision,&nbsp; the record discloses&nbsp; that on&nbsp; January&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1956 plaintiff presented a motion to declare the&nbsp; defendants in contempt of court&nbsp; (Annex VII&nbsp; to Answer).&nbsp; When this motion was called for hearing1 on January 19, 1956, defendants' counsel, upon being informed of the existence of the decision,&nbsp; immediately&nbsp; presented&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for relief. These facts are not denied.&nbsp; It appears, therefore, that the petition for relief was&nbsp; presented on the very day&nbsp; (January 19,&nbsp; 1956)&nbsp; the defendants learned&nbsp; of the existence of the decision,&nbsp; basis of the&nbsp; petition for contempt. <br><br>Under the circumstances, the Court hereby remands the case to the court below with instructions to grant&nbsp; the relief and reinstate&nbsp; the case for trial, if no entry of judgment was made,&nbsp; or to deny the petition for relief if&nbsp; entry of judgment&nbsp; had been made six&nbsp; months or&nbsp; more&nbsp; before January 19, 1956, the date&nbsp; when the petition for&nbsp; relief was filed. <br><br>Without costs. <br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Conception, Reyes, J.
