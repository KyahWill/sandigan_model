				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The defendant&nbsp; has&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; a decision&nbsp; of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila&nbsp; sentencing him to pay to the plaintiff the&nbsp; sum of Pl,339.90, with legal interest from&nbsp; the date of the filing&nbsp; of the complaint and with costs. The amount&nbsp; represents license fees and&nbsp; Mayor's permit fees due from the defendant on&nbsp; his retail&nbsp; sales&nbsp; of flour under the&nbsp; provisions of Ordinance&nbsp; No. 3364.<p>The appellant&nbsp; insists that the&nbsp; promulgation of&nbsp; Executive Order No. 305 and passage of Republic Acts Nos. 426 and 650 rendered Ordinance No. 3364 oppressive and unenforceable.&nbsp; He expands his view by&nbsp; alleging that this ordinance was&nbsp; conceived when flour was free&nbsp; commodity and could be&nbsp; imported by anyone, unlimited as to quantity or time; when&nbsp; it could be sold to anybody, also unlimited as to price or&nbsp; time; whereas, in view of the passage of Republic Acts Nos. 426 and 650 and the promulgation of Executive Order No.&nbsp; 305, flour is controlled, an importer has to secure an import license, the importation is made in the name of&nbsp; the Government and&nbsp; limited as to quantity, and there is&nbsp; control even&nbsp; as&nbsp; to whom to sell and as to the selling price.</p><p>Upon the other&nbsp; hand, it is contended for the appellee that the circumstances mentioned&nbsp; by the appellant are immaterial, the principal consideration&nbsp; being&nbsp; that there is nothing in&nbsp; Republic Acts Nos.&nbsp; 426 and 650&nbsp; or in Executive Order No. 305 which suspends or repeals Ordinance No. 3364.</p><p>We are of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that the&nbsp; appealed decision is correct.&nbsp; Republic Act No. 426, as amended by Republic Act No. 650, merely enumerates what&nbsp; commodities are controlled,&nbsp; regulates&nbsp; importation,&nbsp; creates&nbsp; the&nbsp; Import Control Office,&nbsp; and provides penalty for violations of its provisions. Executive Order No. 305 merely created the PRISCO and&nbsp; dissolved the PRATRA&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; NARIC. There is absolutely nothing in said Executive&nbsp; Order or acts which suspends or repeals the provisions of Ordinance No. 3364. Apart from the rules that repeal by implication is not favored,&nbsp; it is quite clear that the&nbsp; Acts and Executive Order in question may be enforced&nbsp; consistently with Ordinance&nbsp; No. 3364.&nbsp; The ordinance&nbsp; impose&nbsp; a&nbsp; fee&nbsp; on merchants and dealers who sell goods&nbsp; in retail, based on the amount of sales&nbsp; and regardless of&nbsp; profits, with the result that it cannot&nbsp; be said to&nbsp; be&nbsp; inconsistent with Republic Acts Nos. 426 and&nbsp; 650 which merely impose controls&nbsp; on&nbsp; certain&nbsp; commodities.&nbsp;&nbsp; In making reference&nbsp; to the circumstances affecting a retail flour&nbsp; dealer, the&nbsp; appellant undoubtedly wishes&nbsp; to&nbsp; convey the fact that&nbsp; as flour is now a controlled commodity, his profits will necessarily be diminished,&nbsp; if&nbsp; not&nbsp; altogether eliminated.&nbsp; The point is again immaterial, considering that the lawmakers, in&nbsp; enacting Republic&nbsp; Acts Nos.&nbsp; 426&nbsp; and&nbsp; 650, must&nbsp; be deemed to have taken into account the existing conditions, and if repeal&nbsp; or&nbsp; suspension&nbsp; of any law or ordinance is now&nbsp; in order, that function&nbsp; belongs&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; legislative branch of the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate,&nbsp; it is admitted that,&nbsp; in the fixing of the selling and buying&nbsp; prices&nbsp; of flour as controlled commodity, the profit is&nbsp; usually certain and pro-determined, with the result that the enforcement of the ordinance&nbsp; in question&nbsp; cannot be said to be oppressive and concienceless.</p><p>Wherefore, the appealed decision is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against appellant.</p><p><em>Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,&nbsp; Endencia</em>, and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
