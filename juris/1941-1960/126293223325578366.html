				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Cirilo&nbsp; Punzalan,&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; a property&nbsp; situated&nbsp; at 120-124&nbsp; Lopez Jaena,&nbsp; Paco, Manila, assessed&nbsp; at P83400, instituted this case on June 29, 1949, in the Court of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; (Civil Case No.&nbsp; 8358), to annul the sale of said property at public auction made by the Treasurer of the City of Manila in favor of Alfredo S. Ascafla for P18.21, which was the amount of&nbsp; real&nbsp; estate taxes in arrears,&nbsp; and&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages.<br><br>The record shows&nbsp; that&nbsp; the sale was made in accordance with the provisions of Section 2498 of the Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code;&nbsp; that&nbsp; after the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Treasurer issued the corresponding certificate in&nbsp; the name of the purchaser&nbsp; (Exh. 3)&nbsp; ; that on May 28,&nbsp; 1949, a&nbsp; final&nbsp; and absolute deed of&nbsp; sale was executed by the&nbsp; same&nbsp; officer in favor of the&nbsp; purchaser&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of Sec. 2500&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Code; that on May 31, 1948, the City Treasurer&nbsp; wrote a&nbsp; letter (Exh.&nbsp; A)&nbsp; to Cirilo&nbsp; Punzalan advising him of the&nbsp; sale of his property; that&nbsp; on January 20,&nbsp; 1949, long&nbsp; before the expiration&nbsp; of the time granted by&nbsp; law&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; redemption of&nbsp; said&nbsp; property,&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Treasurer&nbsp; again&nbsp; wrote&nbsp; another&nbsp; letter&nbsp; (Exh. B)&nbsp; to Cirilo Punzalan,&nbsp; which two letters did not&nbsp; reach, the&nbsp; addressee and were returned to the&nbsp; sender; that&nbsp; after the expiration of the period of one year, Punzalan came to learn of the sale&nbsp; of his property because the&nbsp; buyer&nbsp; went&nbsp; to see&nbsp; it personally; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; upon&nbsp; being&nbsp; informed&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; he took the necessary steps to redeem it&nbsp; but to no avail.<br><br>On these facts the lower court&nbsp; rendered decision&nbsp; on November 15,1949, declaring the sale null and void because:<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; The "Bagong&nbsp; Balita&nbsp; Ng Bayan",&nbsp; through which the corresponding notice of sale at&nbsp; public auction was published,&nbsp; had only a circulation of about twenty thousand copies and could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be' considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; a newspaper of general circulation in a city like&nbsp; Manila with more&nbsp; than half a million inhabitants at the time and more than forty thousand&nbsp; properties&nbsp; subject to assessment;<br>(2)&nbsp; The buyer Alfredo S. Ascano being at the time of the sale an officer of the Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippine Islands in charge of&nbsp; the Division of Foreign Fund Control of the&nbsp; Bureau of Treasury, was&nbsp; prohibited from making said purchase in accordance with the provision of Section 579&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same Code which&nbsp; reads:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 579. Inhibition Against Purchase of Property at a Tax Sale.â€”Officials and employees of the Government of the Phdlippirte Islands are prohibited from 'purchasing, directly or indirectly, from the.&nbsp; Government, any&nbsp; property&nbsp; sold&nbsp; by the Government&nbsp; for&nbsp; the non-payment of any public&nbsp; lax.&nbsp; Any such purchase&nbsp; by a public official shall be void." and</blockquote>(3)&nbsp; On&nbsp; the ground of equity.</blockquote>From this&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; Alfredo&nbsp; S. Ascano&nbsp; appealed to the Court of&nbsp; Appeals, but this tribunal&nbsp; certified the case&nbsp; to Us&nbsp; for the reason that the&nbsp; only question of fact involved in the&nbsp; appeal, to wit: "Whether the&nbsp; newspaper 'Bagong Balita&nbsp; Ng Bayan' was of&nbsp; general circulation or not",&nbsp; is relied by appellant on&nbsp; the certification issued by the Chief of Inspection Division of the Bureau of Posts, which reads;<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 400px;">"July 15, 1949 <br></div><br>"To Whom it May Concern: "This&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp; certify that, according to the records&nbsp; of this office, 'Bagong Buhay', <i>a daily publication of general circulation</i>,&nbsp; was entered&nbsp; as second-class&nbsp; mail&nbsp; matter&nbsp; in the Manila Post Office&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1947, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; second class&nbsp; mailing privilege granted&nbsp; said paper was revoked on&nbsp; November 1, 1948, due to the discontinuance&nbsp; of publication&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *". </blockquote>and&nbsp; on the doctrine laid down&nbsp; by the Supreme Court&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; of Basa vs. Mercado,&nbsp; 61 Phil. 632, which reads:<br><blockquote>"The&nbsp; law does not require that publication&nbsp; of the notice * * * should be made in the&nbsp; newspaper with&nbsp; the largest circulation. * * *<br><br>"The&nbsp; records show that Ing&nbsp; Kalipunan is a newspaper of&nbsp; general circulation In view of the fact that it is published for dissemination of local&nbsp; news and&nbsp; general information; that it&nbsp; has a&nbsp; <i>bona fide</i> subscription list of paying subscribers;&nbsp; that it is published&nbsp; at regular&nbsp; intervals,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the trial court ordered the publication to be made in <i>Ing Katipunan</i> precisely because it was a newspaper of general&nbsp; circulation&nbsp; in&nbsp; the province&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pampanga."</blockquote>This&nbsp; question&nbsp; of&nbsp; fact was not touched&nbsp; by appellee thus eliminating this point from the&nbsp; issues&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; the appeal.<br><br>In this instance, counsel for appellant makes the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The lower court&nbsp; erred in declaring&nbsp; the auction sale, subject of the&nbsp; main&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; as invalid, merely on equity; and&nbsp; contrary to the&nbsp; provisions of law involved&nbsp; and the weight of authority and evidence adduced in the trial;<br></li><li> The lower court erred in construing the provisions of Section 579 of the Revised Administrative Code; and<br></li><li> The lower court erred in awarding&nbsp; some&nbsp; kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; damages in favor of the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellee.</li></ol></blockquote>Though We&nbsp; are of the&nbsp; opinion and thus&nbsp; hold that the "Bagong&nbsp; Balita Ng Bayan" is&nbsp; or was a&nbsp; <i>daily publication of general circulation</i>, We&nbsp; find that the only questions that need to be&nbsp; considered in&nbsp; this appeal are&nbsp; (1) whether&nbsp; or not Section 579 of&nbsp; the Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code is applicable to&nbsp; the instant&nbsp; case; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; whether or&nbsp; not damages&nbsp; should have been awarded in favor of appellee. On the first point, the trial Judge&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"Defendant Alfredo S. Ascano is an employee of the&nbsp; Government of the Philippine Islands, now Government of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; He&nbsp; admits&nbsp; in his answer to the&nbsp; supplementary complaint, that on May&nbsp; 21, 1948, the date of sale,&nbsp; he was an employee of said Government.&nbsp; By expressed provision of&nbsp; Section 579&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code&nbsp; said&nbsp;&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in&nbsp; his favor&nbsp; made&nbsp; by defendant&nbsp; Treasurer&nbsp; is&nbsp; null&nbsp; and without&nbsp; value&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court has no other&nbsp; alternative than to comply with&nbsp; the mandate of the law.<br><br>"Defendant Ascano alleges that such legal provision is not applicable to him,&nbsp; because the City of Manila is not the&nbsp; Government of the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; This allegation&nbsp; is devoid of merit because the Government of the City is nothing but a political subdivision of the&nbsp; Government of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, or better said, it&nbsp; is but a part of said Government&nbsp; to&nbsp; which&nbsp; Section 579&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; refers to and, consequently, the prohibition contained therein is applicable to the&nbsp; employees of&nbsp; the Central&nbsp; Government&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as to those of the&nbsp; City of Manila;&nbsp; it is as&nbsp; applicable to&nbsp; the properties levied&nbsp; by the Government of the City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila."&nbsp; (TRANSLATION)</blockquote>Anent&nbsp; the damages, appellant does not raise any ques- tion as to the amount fixed by the lower court.&nbsp;&nbsp; He merely argues that&nbsp; the awarding of damages in&nbsp; favor of plaintiff-appellee was&nbsp; merely on an&nbsp; illegal presumption&nbsp; that the auction sale was invalid, and as he contends that the said auction sale was valid and enforceable against the&nbsp; whole world, hence he concludes that&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no basis in fact or&nbsp; in&nbsp; law by&nbsp; which a Court can&nbsp; look upon the appellee with equity,&nbsp; for he&nbsp; is&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of estoppel&nbsp; by&nbsp; his own "laches".&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; to said&nbsp; damages the trial court&nbsp; said:<br><br>"The Court holds that the damages&nbsp; alleged by plaintiff have been established&nbsp; and considers the sum of P500 as sufficient compensation thereof.&nbsp; Defendant Ascano is the only one liable for these damages because, knowing that he was&nbsp; prohibited by law to make the purchase&nbsp; in said&nbsp; auction,&nbsp; he&nbsp; acted&nbsp; in bad&nbsp; faith&nbsp; in&nbsp; concealing&nbsp; this fact and&nbsp; failing to inform the defendant Treasurer of his status as&nbsp; employee of the Government of the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; We have no doubt that the Treasurer of&nbsp; the City of Manila would not have knowingly&nbsp; sold the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in&nbsp; question in contravention&nbsp; of the legal provision&nbsp; aforesaid."&nbsp; (TRANSLATION)<br><br>We certainly agree with the points of view of His Honor on&nbsp; the two&nbsp; questions&nbsp; discussed&nbsp; above.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed&nbsp; from is hereby affirmed, with costs against appellant.<br><br>It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Conception,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; J.&nbsp; B. L.</i>, and <i>Endencia,&nbsp; J.J.</i>,&nbsp; concur.</div>
