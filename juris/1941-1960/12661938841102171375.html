				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These petitions were filed by the&nbsp; Wack Wack&nbsp; Golf and Country Club,&nbsp; Inc., to review the&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals in&nbsp; two cases involving&nbsp; the same corporation (CA-G. R. No. 15910-R&nbsp; and&nbsp; CA-G.&nbsp; R. No. 15902-R). As&nbsp; the issues&nbsp; raised&nbsp; in&nbsp; said&nbsp; cases relate&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; same principle of law, we shall take them up jointly and resolve the questions assigned therein in a&nbsp; single decision &nbsp;<br><br>Petronilo Arcangel, a&nbsp; former&nbsp; employee of&nbsp; the Wack Wack Golf and Country&nbsp; Club,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila a money claim for overtime services rendered to said employer,&nbsp; for unenjoyed vacation leave, moral damages and attorney's&nbsp; fees.&nbsp; The&nbsp; employer having filed its answer to the complaint, the case was accordingly set for trial.&nbsp; At the hearing&nbsp; of&nbsp; May&nbsp; 6, 1955, however, neither the defendant (employer)&nbsp; nor its counsel, Balcoff, Poblador and Angel C.&nbsp; Cruz, appeared notwithstanding the fact&nbsp; that they&nbsp; were&nbsp; duly&nbsp; notified of the hearing&nbsp; since&nbsp; March 22, 1955; hence, the plaintiff was allowed&nbsp; to continue&nbsp; presenting&nbsp; his evidence without the presence of defendant.<br><br>On May 10, 1955, the&nbsp; lower court rendered judgment for&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; employee,&nbsp; awarding&nbsp; him a total&nbsp; of P7,70278.<br><br>On May 14, 1955, the law firm of Juan T. Chuidian, on&nbsp; behalf of the defendant employer, filed a petition to set aside the judgment on the ground of misunderstanding, mistake and excusable neglect, which petition was denied by the lower court in its order of May 31. <br><br>The employer appealed from this&nbsp; order—not from the decision on the merits—to the Court of Appeals claiming that the court <i>a quo</i> committed a grave abuse of discretion in denying its&nbsp; petition for relief.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals, finding&nbsp; no&nbsp; justification&nbsp; for the&nbsp; employer's&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to appear at the hearing, upheld the order appealed from.<br><br>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no disagreement&nbsp; as to the&nbsp; facts allegedly constituting the mistake,&nbsp; accident or excusable&nbsp; negligence upon which the employer's petition for&nbsp; relief was based. As put down&nbsp; in petitioner-appellant's brief filed&nbsp; in the Court of&nbsp; Appeals,&nbsp; and adopted by&nbsp; said court, they are: <br><blockquote>"The (records of this case show that&nbsp; defendant-appellant&nbsp; (employer)&nbsp; was represented by the law office&nbsp; of Balcoff and&nbsp; Poblador and Angel C.&nbsp; Cruz from the inception&nbsp; of this case&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; May 14,&nbsp; 1955, when Law Office Juan T. Chuidian&nbsp; filed its appearance upon being, referred by law office of Balcoff and Poblador on&nbsp; May 12, 1955 the copy of the decision dated May 10, 1955&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Trial Court.<br><br>'Sometime before May 5,&nbsp; 1955 defendant-appellant&nbsp; Wack Wack Golf and&nbsp; Country&nbsp; Club, Inc., had manifested its&nbsp; desire to replace their counsel Messrs.&nbsp; Paredes,&nbsp; Balcoff and Poblador&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case with Law Office Juan T. Chuidian. On May 5, 1955 Atty. Jesus Sayoc&nbsp; of&nbsp; the undersigned&nbsp; law&nbsp; firm&nbsp; conferred&nbsp; with&nbsp; Atty. Angel Cruz of Messrs. Paredes, Balcoff and&nbsp; Poblador for the purpose of securing the&nbsp; court file in this case and effect the substitution of attorney.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mr. Balcoff&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; in the&nbsp; office&nbsp; at the moment and Atty. Angel Cruz declared he had no&nbsp; authority to turn over to Law Office&nbsp; Juan T.&nbsp; Chuidian the court papers and&nbsp; file in this case;&nbsp; besides, there were&nbsp; unpaid&nbsp; bill&nbsp; due Messrs. Paredes, Balcoff and&nbsp; Poblador.&nbsp; Arriving&nbsp; at the&nbsp; office, Mr. Jesus Sayoc&nbsp; advised Mr. Juan&nbsp; T. Chuidian&nbsp; of the reluctance of Messrs. Paredes, Balcoff and&nbsp; Poblador to turn over the court file of&nbsp; the case to the former.&nbsp; In view of&nbsp; this&nbsp; development, Atty.&nbsp; Chuidian called&nbsp; up&nbsp; Atty. Balcoff by telephone&nbsp; and it&nbsp; was&nbsp; agreed between the two gentlemen that inasmuch as&nbsp; Attys. Paredes, Balcoff and Poblador&nbsp; were&nbsp; still&nbsp; the attorneys of record&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case,&nbsp; Atty. Balcoff would send a&nbsp; representative of his law office to appear at the hearing of&nbsp; the case the following day, May" 6, 1955&nbsp; in order to ask for postponement of the case.&nbsp; Consequently, nobody in Law Office Juan T. Chuidian appeared in behalf of defendant-appellant on May 6, 1955 before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Trial Court.&nbsp; As a&nbsp; matter&nbsp; of fact, the records of&nbsp; the case were turned&nbsp; over to Law Office&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; T. Chuidian only on May 13, 1955 after Law Office Juan&nbsp; T.&nbsp; Chuidian had&nbsp; received&nbsp; on May 12, 1955&nbsp; through&nbsp; Messrs.&nbsp; Paredes, Balcoff and&nbsp; Poblador a copy&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; dated&nbsp; May&nbsp; id,&nbsp; 1955 of&nbsp; the Trial Court.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; hand, Atty.&nbsp; Angel Cruz&nbsp; or&nbsp; any&nbsp; associate lawyer of&nbsp; Messr.&nbsp; Paredes, Balcoff and Poblador&nbsp; did&nbsp; not appear for defendant-appellant on May 6, 1955."<br></blockquote>We are with the Court of Appeals&nbsp; in&nbsp; the observation that&nbsp; as of&nbsp; May&nbsp; 6, 1955, the law&nbsp; firm&nbsp; of&nbsp; Balcoff&nbsp; and Poblador and&nbsp; Angel&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cruz were&nbsp; still the&nbsp; employer's counsel&nbsp; of&nbsp; record,&nbsp; the&nbsp; law&nbsp; office&nbsp; of Juan T.&nbsp; Chuidian having entered&nbsp; its&nbsp; appearance in the' case&nbsp; only on May 14, 1955. As such counsel of record, said law firm must have known that, its impending relief as counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; notwithstanding,&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; under&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; to protect the&nbsp; client's&nbsp; interest&nbsp; (which includes appearance at&nbsp; the hearing) until its final release from the professional relationship with&nbsp; such client.&nbsp; For&nbsp; its&nbsp; part,&nbsp; the court could&nbsp; recognize no other&nbsp; representation, on behalf of&nbsp; the client except such&nbsp; counsel of record until a formal substitution&nbsp; of attorney is effected.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, any agreement or&nbsp; arrangement such counsel of record and its client may reach regarding the&nbsp; presentation of the&nbsp; client's&nbsp; case in court is&nbsp; purely their private&nbsp; concern.&nbsp; Proceedings&nbsp; in court cannot be made to depend on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; lack of coordination or understanding between the two law firms in the instant&nbsp; case cannot be considered as a legal excuse or&nbsp; falling within&nbsp; the ambit&nbsp; of excusable negligence&nbsp; to justify the&nbsp; granting of&nbsp; relief from the&nbsp; order&nbsp; declaring the client in default or, as in this case, from a decision entered after presentation of evidence in his absence. <br><br>Where the defendants were given every reasonable opportunity to try their case and&nbsp; no legal excuse was presented&nbsp; for a further adjournment,&nbsp; and order denying defendant's&nbsp; motion to set&nbsp; aside their default and vacate the&nbsp; judgment against them entered upon such default,&nbsp; was proper (Centerville Creamery Co. <i>vs.</i> Waxier, 30 N.Y.S. 2d.&nbsp; 232, 262 App.&nbsp; Div.&nbsp; 1055.) <br><br>G. R. No. L-11724&nbsp; (CA-G. R.&nbsp; No. 15902-R): <br><br>On&nbsp; February 18, 1953, Antonino D. Bernardo, former official of appellant, filed with the Court of First Instance of Manila a claim against&nbsp; the Wack Wack&nbsp; Golf &amp; Country Club, Inc., for overtime pay, unenjoyed vacation and sick leaves from&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; to 1951&nbsp; and attorney's fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the employer denied the claim, the case was set for trial. <br><br>At the hearing of May&nbsp; 12, 1955, after about 8 previous postponements, nobody appeared for the employer although said defendant was represented from the commencement of the proceeding&nbsp; by Atty.&nbsp; Angel C. Cruz and was duly notified&nbsp; of&nbsp; the hearing&nbsp;&nbsp; since March&nbsp; 26, 1955.&nbsp; Consequently, the&nbsp; plaintiff-employee was permitted to continue presenting his&nbsp; evidence before the Deputy Clerk of Court who was&nbsp; delegated for this purpose. <br><br>On May 14, 1955, the lower court adjudged the plaintiff entitled, to&nbsp; the claim, and sentenced&nbsp; defendant-employer to pay the total sum of P26,422.78. <br><br>On the same day,&nbsp; May 14, 1955, the employer represented by the&nbsp; law office&nbsp; of Juan T. Chuidian,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a petition for relief from the order authorizing the Deputy Clerk of Court to&nbsp; receive&nbsp; plaintiff's evidence and&nbsp; for the re-opening of the&nbsp; case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petition was later&nbsp; supplemented by another similarly praying for the setting aside of the decision rendered therein, on the ground of accident or excusable 'negligence.&nbsp; Upon plaintiff's opposition, these petitions were denied&nbsp; by the court in its order of May 31, 1955.&nbsp; From&nbsp; this&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; denial, defendant&nbsp; employer appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; On October&nbsp; 30, 1956, the Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; affirmed&nbsp; the disputed order,&nbsp; for the reason that under&nbsp; the circumstances,&nbsp; there was&nbsp; no justification for defendant's counsel to anticipate that the Court&nbsp; would&nbsp; grant&nbsp; a motion for postponement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the hearing of May 12, 1955. The accident or excusable negligence referred&nbsp; to&nbsp; by the new&nbsp; counsel for defendant employer is stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the petition for relief filed in the lower court, thus:<br><blockquote>"1. That defendant&nbsp; heretofore&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; represented by Atty. Angel&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Cruz;&nbsp; that for certain reasons the defendant&nbsp; recently contracted&nbsp; the services of Law Office of Juan T. Chuidian to handle this&nbsp; case; in substitution of&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Angel&nbsp; Cruz, the appearance of the undersigned law office&nbsp; has been filed with this Honorable Court on May 12, 1955; <br><br>"2. That it was only&nbsp; in&nbsp; the afternoon of&nbsp; May&nbsp; 11, 1955&nbsp; that the records of this case&nbsp; were sent to the&nbsp; undersigned law office, and that Atty. Juan T. Chuidian&nbsp; was&nbsp; then out of town and, consequently,&nbsp; nobody knew what action to take in this case; <br><br>"3. That in the morning of May 12, 1955, Atty. Juan T. Chuidian telephoned the undersigned law office&nbsp; and&nbsp; requested that&nbsp; one of the assistant&nbsp; attorneys appear at the&nbsp; sala&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with the scheduled hearing of the&nbsp; above entitled case, and to move&nbsp; for the postponement&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; on&nbsp; the obvious&nbsp; reason that&nbsp; the undersigned Jaw firm was&nbsp; not prepared right&nbsp; then and there&nbsp; to proceed with the trial of the case&nbsp; inasmuch as the facts of the case were not then sufficiently known to any of the associate attorney<br><br>"4. That when&nbsp; Attorney Suntay&nbsp; of&nbsp; the undersigned law office arrived at the sala of this Honorable Court, he was informed that the case had been called earlier in the calendar and&nbsp; in view of the failure of any person&nbsp; to&nbsp; appear in behalf&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendant, the Deputy Clerk of Court was&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive the evidence for the plaintiff; <br><br>"5. The subsequent&nbsp; efforts of Attorney&nbsp; Suntay to&nbsp; suspend the reception of&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; evidence and postpone the hearing&nbsp; proved fruitless; ***"<br></blockquote>From&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; facts,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is evident that&nbsp; Atty. Suntay's appearance (late by&nbsp; some&nbsp; 35 minutes) at the hearing of the case was solely for&nbsp; the purpose of securing another postponement of&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial;&nbsp; that his delay was brought&nbsp; about&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; principal counsel in town, and by want of&nbsp; instructions from the latter as to what action&nbsp; his&nbsp; assistants should&nbsp; take&nbsp; on the matter; that the records&nbsp; of the case&nbsp; were&nbsp; only&nbsp; turned over to the&nbsp; new&nbsp; counsel on&nbsp; May 11, and that there&nbsp; was no time to prepare for the trial.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, the employer's charge that the&nbsp; trial court abused its&nbsp; discretion in denying its petition for&nbsp; relief from the order authorizing&nbsp; the reception of plaintiff's&nbsp; evidence in the absence of defendant&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp;&nbsp; rendered in the case,&nbsp; is premised on the ground (1)&nbsp; that counsel's, tardiness or delay as well as&nbsp; his unpreparedness to go&nbsp; to&nbsp; trial&nbsp; are accidental or&nbsp; may&nbsp; be considered as&nbsp; excusable, negligence, arid&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; should have&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; the motion for postponement. <br><br>Both points find adequate answer in the Court of Appeals ruling which we quote with approval<br><blockquote>"The hearing on May 12, 1955 had been fixed, with&nbsp; the conformity of both parties, as early as March&nbsp; 18, 1955.&nbsp; Not&nbsp; only that, but the verbal&nbsp; order&nbsp; issued in open court was&nbsp; supplemented by&nbsp; a written order, copy of which was received by defendant's&nbsp; counsel on March 26, 1955.&nbsp; On the date of the trial&nbsp; defendant was still represented by Atty. Angel C. Cruz as counsel of record.&nbsp; Up to then there had&nbsp; been no substitution of attorneys, nor&nbsp; had&nbsp; Attorney&nbsp; Cruz&nbsp; withdrawn&nbsp; his&nbsp; appearance&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case.&nbsp; Indeed&nbsp; the record doea riot show&nbsp; that he&nbsp; ever&nbsp; did withdraw his&nbsp; appearance or filed a motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; substitution.&nbsp; The responsibility&nbsp; for representing defendant&nbsp; at&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; on May 12, 1955&nbsp; was therefore still his.&nbsp; On the other hand if it is true, as alleged by appellant, that the services of Atty. Juan T. Chuidian had&nbsp; been engaged sometime prior to May&nbsp; 11, 1955&nbsp; then&nbsp; it&nbsp; was the&nbsp; latter's&nbsp; duty to file&nbsp; his&nbsp; appearance&nbsp; opportunely and&nbsp; prepare&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial on May 12.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; to be&nbsp; presumed&nbsp; that&nbsp; in accepting the case Attorney Chuidian knew&nbsp; that the trial was to be held&nbsp; on&nbsp; that date; and he certainly was&nbsp; not justified in&nbsp; accepting&nbsp; the case unless he was prepared to go to trial as&nbsp; scheduled.&nbsp; He&nbsp; had no right to take for granted the liberality of&nbsp; the court or the generosity of plaintiff by&nbsp; appearing,&nbsp; through an assistant of his,&nbsp; after the case had been actually called on the calendar and while the evidence of the plaintiff was already being&nbsp; received,&nbsp; and then only to ask (verbally) for&nbsp; another postponement.<br><br>"All motions&nbsp; for&nbsp; postponement&nbsp;&nbsp; should be&nbsp; presented&nbsp; at&nbsp; such time as is practicable&nbsp; to prevent the adverse party&nbsp; from incuring unnecessary expenses&nbsp; by coming to&nbsp; trial, otherwise postponement shall be denied.&nbsp; And a party moving for postponement should be in court&nbsp; on the day&nbsp; set&nbsp; for trial&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion is not acted upon favorably&nbsp; before&nbsp; that&nbsp; day.&nbsp; He has no right to rely&nbsp; either on the liberality of the court, or on the generosity of the&nbsp; adverse party.' (Moran on Rules of Court, 1952 edition, pp. 651-653, citing Linus <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Rovira, 61&nbsp; Phil., 137; Miranda <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Mun. of Navotas, 2&nbsp; Phil., 667; Quimson <i>vs.</i> Suarez, 64 Phil., 907; Macondray &amp; Co. <i>vs.</i> Paredes, G. R.&nbsp; No. 38255, Sept. 5, 1933; Sunico <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Villapando, 14 Phil., 352.) "<br></blockquote>In addition, the records of these two&nbsp; cases reveal&nbsp; that even prior to May 5, 1955, defendant-appellant had manifested its&nbsp; desire to replace its former counsel&nbsp; Messrs. Paredes, Balcoff &amp; Poblador with&nbsp; the&nbsp; law&nbsp; office of Atty. Juan&nbsp; T.&nbsp; Chuidian.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this&nbsp; were so, it was&nbsp; the bounden duty of both law firms to have made&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary arrangement for the protection of the interest&nbsp; of their client. Their failure to do&nbsp; so cannot&nbsp; certainly be considered excusable neglect to the&nbsp; extent of making the action of the trial&nbsp; court, as well as the Court&nbsp; of Appeals in denying relief based&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; an abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; constituting reversible&nbsp; error. <br><br>Although no longer necessary in&nbsp; view of the conclusions already reached and&nbsp; expressed, attention may be&nbsp; drawn to&nbsp; the lack of the required affidavits of merit to&nbsp; support the&nbsp; petitions for&nbsp; relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are&nbsp; sworn statements on the alleged mistake,&nbsp; accident and/or excusable negligence,&nbsp; there is, in G. R. No.&nbsp; L-11724,&nbsp; total absence of, and in G. R. No. L-11725, insufficient affidavit showing the facts&nbsp; constituting the valid defense which the movant may prove&nbsp; in case a new trial&nbsp; is granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even&nbsp; in the latter&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; only reference&nbsp; made in the affidavit of the&nbsp; assistant lawyer in the law firm of&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Chuidian who, as admitted in the pleadings&nbsp; submitted by them, did not know the facts of&nbsp; the case, was the statement "that the defendant has&nbsp; genuine and&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide&nbsp;</span> defenses to the claims interposed&nbsp; by plaintiff,&nbsp; more particularly&nbsp; set out in its Amended&nbsp; Answer&nbsp; dated August&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1954."&nbsp;&nbsp; This amended&nbsp; answer is not&nbsp; under&nbsp; oath.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; the mere incorporation thereof by reference made by one who had&nbsp; no knowledge&nbsp; of the said defenses does not comply with the&nbsp; requirements&nbsp; of the rules and decisions on the matter.&nbsp; The affidavits&nbsp; of merit must state facts, and not mere conclusions or opinions, otherwise they are not valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup><br><br>Anent the question raised by petitioner in both instances regarding the legality of the lower court's order authorizing the&nbsp; Deputy&nbsp; Clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court&nbsp; to receive plaintiff's evidence, we again make our own the Court of Appeals ruling, thus: <br><blockquote>"Defendant next&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; Court&nbsp; acted contrary to law and&nbsp; gravely&nbsp; abused&nbsp; its&nbsp; discretion when&nbsp; it&nbsp; delegated the Deputy Clerk&nbsp; of Court to receive&nbsp; plaintiff's evidence.&nbsp; It&nbsp; should be borne&nbsp; in&nbsp; mind&nbsp; that&nbsp; the delegation&nbsp; was made in view of the absence of defendant&nbsp; and&nbsp; his counsel and that&nbsp; the function&nbsp; thus delegated was&nbsp; merely ministerial, namely, the taking down of the testimony of&nbsp; the witnesses&nbsp; and&nbsp; the marking&nbsp; down of whatever documentary&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; would&nbsp; be presented.&nbsp; There&nbsp; could be no occasion for&nbsp; the exercise of judicial discretion such&nbsp; as might&nbsp; have been called for if&nbsp; the other&nbsp; party&nbsp; had been present to object to questions that&nbsp; were&nbsp; propounded or to&nbsp; the admission of exhibits. <br><br>It cannot&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; be&nbsp; seriously maintained&nbsp; that&nbsp; any prejudice was caused to defendant by the action taken by the Court."<br></blockquote>Wherefore,&nbsp; finding&nbsp; no error&nbsp; in the&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals sought to be nullified, the petitions filed in these tjwo cases are hereby dismissed, with&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered. <br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
