				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila dismissing an action for prohibition directed against a 
municipal judge.
<p align="justify">It appears that appellants are, and for some time have been, 
tenants of certain <em>accesorias</em> comprised in a building located at Muelle 
de Binondo, Manila, and belonging to the appellee, Benito Gonzales. Early in 
1947 the tenants were required to pay higher rent, but as they refused to do so, 
the landlord chose to terminate the lease with notice for them to vacate the 
premises. Thus faced with imminent ouster, but before they could be taken to 
court, the tenants stole a march on their landlord by interposing, each of them, 
an action in the Court of First Instance to compel him to accept a lesser amount 
consigned in court as tendered rent, followed shortly thereafter by a joint 
action for declaratory relief to have the leased premises declared residential 
in nature for the purposes of the rent thereof. All these actions were dismissed 
by the trial court and are now on appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">After the tenants had filed their actions, the landlord, on his 
part, instituted proceedings in the municipal court to eject them from the 
leased premises on the ground that their lease, which was from month to month, 
had already terminated. Trial of these cases for ejection was, at first, 
suspended pending the outcome of the actions for consignation and declaratory 
relief. But, following the dismissal of these actions the suspension was lifted, 
and trial was about to be resumed when herein appellants sought to restrain it 
through an action for prohibition in the Court of First Instance. It is the 
dismissal of this action by that court that is now before us for review.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellants' claim to stay of trial in the actions for ejection 
is predicated on the existence of other pending cases between the same parties 
and relating to the same subject-matter. But we note that the issue is not the 
same in all the actions. Whereas the ejection cases pose the issue of the 
alleged termination of the lease, the question for ajudication in the 
consignation and declaratory relief cases refers merely to the amount of lawful 
rent. It is obvious that the decision in the cases last mentioned will not 
necessarily dispose of the issue in the others and conclude the controversy 
between the parties. It is, of course, within the sound discretion of a court to 
hold one lawsuit in abeyance to abide the outcome of another where the parties 
and the issues are the same. But it is equally within the court's discretion to 
refuse a stay "where it appears that whatever may be the result of the first 
action, a trial of the second will be necessary." (53 Am. Jur., 36.) As was said 
in a case, "it is only where the decision in one action will determine all the 
questions in the other action, and the judgment on one trial will dispose of the 
controversy in both actions, that a case for a stay is presented." (Rosenberg 
vs. Slotchin [1917], 181 App. Div., 137, 168 N. Y. S., 101; 81 Law. ed., 168.) 
Under this salutary rule of practice, appellants' claim to a stay cannot 
successfully be urged.</p>
<p align="justify">It should also be borne in mind that the practice of allowing a 
stay in one action pending the outcome of another is not of universal 
application. In every case the court will consider whether justice will be done 
by granting the stay, always mindful of the possibility that it may work damage 
to someone else. (53 Am. Jur., 36.) In the present case, the suspension of 
proceedings in the ejection cases would work injustice to the landlord with the 
paralization of his summary remedy for the ouster of tenants who insist on 
occupying his property against his will beyond the period of their lease.</p>
<p align="justify">As we see it, the whole controversy between landlord and tenant 
in the present case may be resolved in the actions for <em>desahucio</em> so 
that if any stay should be granted at all it should be in the consignation and 
declaratory relief cases. A contrary ruling would allow a circumvention of the 
rules by frustrating the purpose of <em>desahucio</em> as a summary remedy. Such 
a result should be avoided.</p>
<p align="justify">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the respondent judge 
made a good use of his discretion in denying the suspension of trial of the 
<em>desahucio</em> cases, so that the petition for prohibition was properly 
denied by the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p align="justify">The decision appealed from is, therefore, affirmed with costs 
against the appellants.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</em> and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>CONCURRING</i></p>
<p align="justify">MORAN, <i>C.J.</i>: </p>
<p align="justify">I concur in the result upon the rule that the pendency of 
another action may be pleaded "only when the judgment to be rendered in the 
action first instituted will be such that, regardless of what party is 
successful, it will amount to <em>res adjudicata</em> against the second 
action." For instance, a pending action to annul a mortgage is not a bar to an 
action for foreclosure of the same mortgage, for the reason that, although the 
parties are or may be the same, if the decision in the first action upholds the 
validity of the mortgage, then it is no obstacle to the prosecution of the 
action for foreclosure. (Manuel vs. Wiggett, 14 Phil., 9; Hongkong &amp; 
Shanghai Banking Corp. vs. Aldecoa &amp; Co., 30 Phil., 255; <em>see also</em> 
Viuda de Hernaez vs. Jison, 40 Off. Gaz., 3646.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In other words "it is not sufficient that 
the result of the first action <em>may be</em> determinative of the second 
<em>in a certain contingency</em>; the situation must be such that the result of 
the first <em>will be</em> determinative of the second <em>in any event</em>." 
(Italics ours.) For instance, an action brought by the holder of an insurance 
policy to reform the contract, and in the alternative, if the granting of this 
relief be found impracticable, to rescind the same, constitutes no obstacle to 
the maintenance of an action by the general agent of the insurance company to 
recover on the note given for the first premium. (J. Northcott &amp; Co. vs. 
Villa-Abrille, 41 Phil., 462.)</p> It is obvious that in the instant appeal the consignation and 
declaratory relief cases which have reference merely to the amount of lawful 
rent do not bar the ejection cases, because if it is adjudged in the former 
cases that the rent agreed upon by the parties is reasonable then the ejection 
cases may go on.<br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><font color="#ff0000">[1]</font> 72 Phil., 203.</div>
