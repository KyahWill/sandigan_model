				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 4 September 1956&nbsp; the President of the Philippines appointed Perfecto&nbsp; Gallardo <span style="font-style: italic;">ad</span> <i>interim</i> Justice of the Peace of Lupao, Nueva Ecija.&nbsp;&nbsp; He took his&nbsp; oath, assumed office and performed&nbsp; his duties as such.&nbsp; On 10&nbsp; April 1957 the Commission&nbsp; on Appointments&nbsp; confirmed his ad <i>interim</i> appointment (53&nbsp; Off. Gaz. 2439).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 12&nbsp; April 1957 the President of the Philippines nominated Francisco Andres&nbsp; for appointment as Justice of the Peace of Quezon, Nueva Ecija.&nbsp; On 24&nbsp; April 1957 the&nbsp; Commission on Appointments approved his&nbsp; nomination (53 Off. Gaz. 2745).<br><br>He also took his&nbsp; oath, assumed office and performed his duties as such.&nbsp; Since their assumption&nbsp; in office, the two Justices of the Peace had been regularly paid their respective monthly salaries until the enactment&nbsp; and effectivity of Republic Act No. 1800, the&nbsp; appropriation law&nbsp; for the fiscal year 1957-1958, which failed to&nbsp; provide for their respective salaries.&nbsp; On 8&nbsp; August 1957&nbsp; the Secretary of Justice recommended to the President that in view of the merger&nbsp; of the towns of San Jose and Lupao, and of Santo Domingo&nbsp; and Quezon, Nueva&nbsp; Ecija,&nbsp; into&nbsp; two&nbsp; separate Justice&nbsp; of the Peace court circuits, Gelasio T. Yusi and Ignacio Lustre be retained as Justices of the Peace of the newly&nbsp; created circuits, respectively&nbsp; (Annex A).&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; 21 August 1957 the President designated Gelasio&nbsp; T.&nbsp; Yusi as Justice of the Peace of San Jose and Lupao, and Ignacio Lustre as&nbsp; Justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Peace of&nbsp; Santo Domingo and Quezon (Annexes B and C).<br><br>On&nbsp; 4 September 1957 the Undersecretary of Justice&nbsp; transmitted to Gelasio.&nbsp; T.&nbsp; Yusi through&nbsp; the&nbsp; Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, Fourth Judicial District, his designation as Justice of the Peace of San Jose and Lupao and requested the Executive Judge to advise&nbsp; Perfecto Gallardo that he had&nbsp; ceased to hold office as&nbsp; Justice of the Peace of Lupao in&nbsp; view of the elimination of his salary item in Republic Act No. 1800, which took effect&nbsp; on 1 July&nbsp; 1957 (Annex D).&nbsp; On 9 September the Executive Judge advised Perfecto Gallardo and Francisco Andres of the merger of their respective courts with another to form circuit court and of the&nbsp; designation by the President of Messrs. Gelasio T. Yusi and Ignacio Lustre as Justices of the Peace of the circuit courts&nbsp; of San&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; and Lupao, and&nbsp; Santo Domingo and&nbsp; Quezon,&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, and requested them (Gallardo and Andres) to turn over all the papers&nbsp; kept in their&nbsp; respective courts&nbsp; to the two designated&nbsp; Justices of the Peace (Annexes E and F).&nbsp;&nbsp; On 4 October&nbsp; 1957 the Secretary of Justice requested the Executive Judge to direct Messrs. Yusi and Lustre to hold court regularly in their respective territorial circuits;&nbsp; that&nbsp; if&nbsp; Messrs. Gallardo and Andres refuse to vacate their respective offices, Messrs.&nbsp; Yusi&nbsp; and&nbsp; Lustre&nbsp; be authorized&nbsp; to&nbsp; hold court in any other place in&nbsp; the municipal building; that they be reminded to observe office&nbsp; hours regularly within their respective jurisdictions, otherwise their salary would be correspondingly reduced;&nbsp; and that the provincial fiscal be requested not to recognize Messrs. Gallardo and Andres as Justices of the Peace of Lupao&nbsp; and Quezon&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; J.)&nbsp; On&nbsp; 11&nbsp; October&nbsp; 1957, in&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the failure of Ignacio Lustre to discharge the functions of his office due to ill health, the Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Nueva Ecija,&nbsp; Fourth Judicial District, designated Joaquin Tabios, Justice of the Peace of Licab, to act in his place&nbsp; (Annex K).<br><br>On 6&nbsp; December&nbsp; 1957&nbsp; Perfecto Gallardo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Francisco Andres filed in this Court a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; and&nbsp; on 28 March 1958 an amended petition contesting the validity and legality of the designation of the respondents Yusi and Lustre as Justices of the Peace of San&nbsp; Jose and&nbsp; Lupao,&nbsp; and Santo Domingo and Quezon, respectively, and of the provisions of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1800&nbsp; eliminating their respective salary items; and praying&nbsp; that&nbsp; the respondent Secretary of Justice&nbsp; be ordered to recognize them as the lawful Justices of the Peace of their respective courts and the&nbsp; Chief Accounting Officer and the Judicial&nbsp; Officer of the Department of Justice to pay their respective salaries beginning 1 July 1957;&nbsp; and for other&nbsp; just and equitable relief.<br><blockquote>Article VIII of the Constitution provides: Section 1.&nbsp; The Judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior&nbsp; courts&nbsp; as may be established by law.<br><br>SEC. 2. The Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts, * * *.<br><br>SEC. 9. The members of the Supreme Court and all judges of inferior courts shall&nbsp; hold office during good behavior, until they reach the age of seventy years, or become incapacitated to discharge the&nbsp; duties of their&nbsp; office.&nbsp; They&nbsp; shall receive. such compensation as may be fixed by law, which&nbsp; shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.&nbsp; * * *.<br></blockquote>SECTION 70, Republic Act No. 296,&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>Justices of the peace haying the requisite legal qualifications shall hold&nbsp; office&nbsp; during good behavior, until they reach&nbsp; the age of seventy years, or become&nbsp; incapacitated to discharge&nbsp; the&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of their office, unless sooner removed in accordance with law or unless his. office be lawfully abolished or merged in&nbsp; the jurisdiction of another justice of the peace; <i>Provided</i>,&nbsp; That&nbsp; in case the public interest requires it, a justice of the peace&nbsp; of&nbsp; one municipality may be transferred to another.<br></blockquote>Republic Act No. 1150&nbsp; (the appropriation law for the fiscal year 1954-1955, p. 284 and Republic Act No. 1350 (the appropriation law for the fiscal year 1955-1956, p. 299)&nbsp; provided salary items for one Justice of the Peace for the circuit court of San Jose and Lupao and another for the circuit court of Santo Domingo and Quezon.&nbsp; In the ensuing&nbsp; fiscal year (1956-1957), Congress provided salary items for one Justice of the Peace for each of the four municipalities, thereby establishing a court for each of them (Republic Act No. 1600, p. 355).&nbsp; This was the appropriation law in force when the petitioners were appointed to their&nbsp; respective positions.&nbsp; In the next fiscal year (1957-1958), Congress&nbsp; merged the salary items of the Justices of the Peace of San Jose and Lupao, and Santo Domingo and Quezon, thereby&nbsp; establishing&nbsp; one circuit court for San Jose and Lupao and another for Santo Domingo and&nbsp; Quezon, and eliminating&nbsp; the salary items for the Justices of the&nbsp; Peace of Lupao and Quezon (Republic Act No. 1800, p. 342).&nbsp; In the succeeding fiscal year, 1958-1959&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 2080, pp. 457-458), and in the present fiscal year, 1959-1960 (Republic Act No. 2300, p. 392), Congress again provided for the salary items of one Justice of the&nbsp; Peace for&nbsp; each of&nbsp; the&nbsp; four municipalities, thereby&nbsp; establishing a court for&nbsp; each of them.<br><br>The question submitted&nbsp; to this Court for determination has become moot&nbsp; in view of&nbsp; the provisions of part&nbsp; One, section F, sub-section 4, paragraph VI,&nbsp; sub-paragraph 2, of Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 2080, the appropriation act for the fiscal year 1958-1959 (p. 484), which provides:<br><blockquote>Justices of the Peace whose position had been created in previous Acts and Who had already&nbsp; been appointed to said positions and whose appointments had been confirmed by the&nbsp; Commission on Appointments but whose items were eliminated in subsequent appropriation Acts and are again restored in this Act shall continue holding said positions unless otherwise disqualified by law.<br></blockquote>A similar provision is found in Republic Act No. 2300, the appropriation act for the fiscal year 1959-1960 (p.413).<br><br>The petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
