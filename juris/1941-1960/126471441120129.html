				<BR><STRONG>JUGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>We are  asked to review on  certiorari  the  decision of the Court of Appeals in these two cases, which were decided together by said Court, on  the  principal  ground  that the Oourt of First  Instance of Quezon Province which tried the case had no  original jurisdiction and, consequently, the Court  of Appeals  had  no appellate  jurisdiction  over the crime charged.</p>
<p>The above two cases were  commenced  in the Court of First Instance of Quezon Province, Marcial Punzalan being the accused in both cases.  In Case No. 11041, the offended party is Moises Escueta, and in Case No.  11041, the  complainant is Isidro Capino.  The information in Case No. 11041 is of the same tenor as that in Case  No.  11041,  with the difference as to the offended party.  Said information reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The undersigned, Provincial Fiscal, accuses Marcial Punzalan of the crime of maltreatment with physical injuries, denned and punished under article 235 in connection with article 266 of the  Revised Penal Code, committed as  follows:</p>
  <p>"That  on or about the 14th day of  November,  1951,  in the Municipality of Tiaong, Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this  Hon.  Court,  the said accused,  being the Municipal Mayor of said municipality, taking advantage of his official position as such, without any justifiable motive, and with evident purpose of extorting confession from one  Moises Escueta did then itnd there willfully, unlawfully and  feloniously illtreat the latter, by then and there assaulting, beating and striking the abdomen, face, breast and arms with an Automatic Pistol, caliber .45 and his fist, while said Moises Escueta was kept in the Camp of the Phil. Ground Force  (PGF)  located in the  said  municipality, thereby causing injuries in the different  parts  of his body which required medical attendance for a  period  of seven (7)  days, and incapacitated  the said offended party from performing his customary labor for the same period of time". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After joint trial, the appellant was found guilty of slight physical injuries only, and sentenced to suffer 30 days of <em>arresto menor</em> with the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay  the costs.</p>
<p>During the trial, the defendant moved to quash the  information on the ground  that the  allegations contained therein  do not  constitute  the crime  of maltreatment of prisoners, and that whatever offenses are charged therein do not fall within the jurisdiction  of the trial court.</p>
<p>The trial  court, in its decision, denied the motion to quash, but acquitted  the  appellant of maltreatment' of prisoners with  physical injuries as defined and penalized in Article 235 in connection with Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code,  and convicted him of slight physical injuries under paragraph 1 of Article 266 of  said Code, sentencing him in each of the two cases to 3D days of <em>arresto menor.</em></p>
<p>The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals, which found him  guilty of grave coercion,  and, compensating the aggravating circumstance of abuse of authority with the mitigating  circumstance  of passion and  obfuscation, sentenced him to suffer 2 months  and 21 days of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> to pay a fine of PI50 with the corresponding subsidiary  imprisonment in  case of  insolvency  and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>In this Court, the appellant contends that the  Court of First Instance had no jurisdiction over the crime alleged in the information, and, consequently, the Court of Appeals had no appellate jurisdiction  and asks for  his  acquittal with costs <em>de oficio.</em></p>
<p>The question at issue is whether the  court of first instance had jurisdiction to take Cognizance of the case in view of the allegations of the information.</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the complaint accuses the appellant of a violation of Article 235 in connection with Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code.  Under Article 235, it is necessary that the maltreated prisoner be under the  charge of the officer maltreating him.  There is no such  allegation in the information above quoted.  The  prisoners, Moises Escueta and Isidro Capino, according  to the information, were  simply kept in the Camp  of the Philippine Ground Force in the municipality of  Tiaong; but it is not alleged therein that they were under the charge of Punzalan as Mayor of Tiaong., Hence, one of the essential elements of the offense under Article 235 was lacking.   Had  that allegation been made in the  information, the punishment being<span style="font-style: italic;"> arresto mayor</span> in its medium period to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correcional</span> in its minimum period. the Court of First Instance of Quezon Province would have had jurisdiction, and, consequently, the Court of Appeals, appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The allegation in  the information that the physical injuries suffered by the  offended party required seven  days medical attendance with incapacity to work for the same period only qualifies the crime as slight physical injuries, which come under the jurisdiction of the  justice of the peace court and not of the court of first instance.  However,  the appellant overlook the allegation in the information that the maltreatment was  committed by the accused with evident purpose  of extorting confession" from the offended party, while the .latter was kept in the Camp of the Philippine Ground  Force in Tiaong.  This  allegation amounts to grave coercion, which is within the jurisdiction of the court of first instance, as it is punished  under Ar tide 286 sof the Revised Penal  Code with <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> and a fine not exceeding P500.</p>
<p>The appellant claims that the coercion  was  not  consummated but frustrated  only for the reason that the offended party did not confess the crime attributed to him. This conclusion is contrary  to  the doctrine laid  down by this  Court in  U. S. <em>vs.</em> Cusi, 10  Phil, 413, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Coercion.</em>â€”The fact that an  individual was maltreated for the purpose of compelling to  confess a  crime which was attributed to him,  constitute the crime of consummated  coercion,  even if  the agents of the authorities who carried out the maltreatment did not accomplish their purpose to draw from him a confession, which it was their intention to  obtain by  the employment of such means".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This  doctrine  was reiterated in the case of  U. S.  <em>vs.</em> Pabalan,  37  Phil., 352, where it did not appear that the offended party acceded to the purpose of the coercion.  It is unnecessary to say that inasmuch as the allegations in the information  conferred jurisdiction on the  court of first instance, the fact that the accused was convicted of a lesser crime included within  those allegations did not deprive the court of  its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision of the  Court of Appeals is affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.   It Is  so ordered.</p>
