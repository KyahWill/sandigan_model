				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For killing a co-inmate in the Bilibid Prisons at Muntinglupa, Rizal, 
Eutiquio Yamson and Primo Romero were charged before the Court of First Instance 
of Rizal with the crime of Murder in an information which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 28th day of February, 1958, in the municipality of 
Muntinlupa, province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who are convicts confined in the New 
Bilibid Prisons by virtue ol final judgments rendered against them, at night 
time, circumstance deliberately sought to insure success in the commission of 
the crime, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping and aiding one 
another, with evident premeditation and treachery, armed with deadly weapons, 
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously kill Maximo Reyes, also 
a ccnvict confined in the same institution,by stabbing him with improvised 
weapons, pointed and/or sharpened, thereby inflicting upon him multiple stab 
wounds which directly caused his death;</p>
<p>That the aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism is present in the 
commission of the crime in that the crime was committed after the accused have 
been convicted by final judgments and while they were serving the said judgments 
in the New Bilibid Prisons.</p>
<p>Contrary to law with the following aggravating circumstances:</p>
<p>1. That the crime was committed with insult to public authorities; <br>2. 
That the crime was committed by armed men or persons who insure or afford 
impunity; <br>3. Use of superior strength or means was employed to weaken the 
defense; <br>4. Cruelty; <br>5. That the crime was committed where public 
authorities were engaged in the discharge of their duties."</p></blockquote>
<p>At their arraignment on March 15, 1958, Atty. Jose Atienza, counsel <em>de 
oficio</em> of the appellants, moved to withdraw his appearance and the 
appellants manifested their desire to secure the assistance of their own 
counsel. The trial court reset the arraignment to April 16, 1958 in the morning, 
but enjoined Atty. Atienza to continue to appear for them until the appearance 
of the new counsel. The arraignment for April 16,1958, was transferred to April 
21, . 1958, on which date both accused, with the assistance of Atty. Atienza, 
entered a plea of guilty.</p>
<p>On May 31, 1958, the trial court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion 
of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime as charged in the information, which also alleges 
that the aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism is present together with 
five other aggravating circumstances. There is only one mitigating circumstance 
present, that is the plea of guilty, but since this is not enough to offset the 
above aggravating circumstances, the Court hereby sentences the accused to 
suffer the maximum penalty provided by law which is death and to indemnify the 
heirs of the offended party in the sum of P3,000.00 and to pay his corresponding 
share of the costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the penalty imposed the case was automatically elevated to this 
Court, for review. Counsel <em>de oficio</em>, Atty. Ricardo D. Gallano, raised 
eight (8) errors which pose only the propriety and correctness of taking into 
consideration the aggravating circumstances described in the information and the 
imposition of the death penalty. The arguments of counsel center on the 
assumption that the aggravating circumstances did not attend the commission of 
the offense and that no evidence was adduced to prove them. Counsel further 
discourses on the alleged improvidence of the plea of guilty on the part of the 
appellants, with veiled insinuation that said appellants were not fully informed 
of the consequences of this plea. </p>
<p>We are fully convinced that before the appellants entered their plea of 
guilty, they were apprised of the import and consequences thereof. They did not 
plead, without the assistance of counsel. Counsel <em>de oficio</em> was all the 
time at hand. The presumption of regularity and faithfulness in the performance 
of official functions, on the part of counsel <em>de oficio</em>, has not been 
overcome. No evidence appears on record that he had failed in his duty to advise 
the appellants of what to do. It would be creating a dangerous precedent to say 
now that the advice to plead guilty by the appointed counsel <em>de oficio</em> 
was improvident. The period embraced from April 21,1958, date of arraignment, 
and May 31,1958, date of promulgation of the sentence, could have given the 
appellants or counsel, ample time to move, or complain if their plea of guilty 
was improvidently given.</p>
<p>The issues raised by counsel in his brief were already answered by us in a 
number of cases. In U.S. <em>vs</em>. Barba, 29 Phil., 206, and U.S. 
<em>vs</em>. Santiago, 35 Phil., 20, it was held that a plea of guilty is an 
admission of all the material facts alleged in the complaint or information. In 
the subsequent cases, we ruled that a plea of guilty when formally entered in 
arraignment is sufficient to sustain a conviction for any offense charged in the 
information, without the necessity of requiring additional evidence, since by so 
pleading, the defendant himself has supplied the necessary proof (People 
<em>vs</em>. Valencia, 59 Phil., 42; People <em>vs</em>. Palupe, 69 Phil., 702.) 
It matters not even if the offense is capital for the admission (plea of guilty) 
covers both the crime as well as its attendant circumstances (People 
<em>vs</em>. Acosta, 98 Phil., 642; 52 Off. Gaz. [4] 1930). The allegation that 
the defendants did not get any practical benefit in pleading guilty to the crime 
charged, is not a plausible argument to dub the plea of guilty, as improvidently 
made. As well observed by the Solicitor General, "The matter of pleading guilty 
to a charge is not a game. An accused pleads guilty because he believes that he 
is guilty. The advantages that he may get by so pleading are mere secondary 
considerations. Using the very argument of appellants that their plea of guilty 
did not'improve their situation we ask, what advantage would appellant achieve 
by undergoing a trial?"</p>
<p>The excuse that they might not have understood the import of their plea of 
guilty, as the aggravating circumstances were described in the information in 
the technical language of the law, is untenable, to say the least. They were 
assisted by counsel and the presumption is. that said counsel informed them of 
the possible aftermaths of their plea.</p>
<p>It is alleged that the trial court should have required additional evidence 
after the plea of guilty, to show the existence of the aggravating circumstances 
described in the information. In answer it would be well to reproduce hereunder, 
the pronouncements of this Court, regarding the suggested practice of calling 
witnesses or presenting evidence, in support of the accused's plea of 
guilty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * (1) The essence of the plea of guilty in a criminal trial is that the 
accused, on arraignment, admits his guilt freely, voluntarily, and with full 
knowledge of the consequences and meaning of his act, and with a clear 
understanding of the precise hature of the crime or crimes charged in the 
complaint or information.</p>
<p>(2) Such a plea of guilty, when formally entered on arraignment, is 
sufficient to sustain a conviction of any offense charged in the information, 
even a capital offense, without the introduction of further evidence, the 
defendant having himself supplied the necessary proof.</p>
<p>(3) There is nothing in the law in this jurisdiction which forbids the 
introduction of evidence as to the guilt of the accused, and the circumstances 
attendant upon the commission of the crime, after "J the entry of a plea of 
'guilty.'</p>
<p>(4) Having in mind the danger of the entry of improvident pleas of 'guilty' 
in criminal cases, the prudent and advisable course, es- 3 pecially in cases 
where in grave crimes are charged, is to take additional evidence as to the 
guilt of the Accused and the circumstances attendant upon the commission of the 
crime.</p>
<p>(5) The better practice would indicate that, when practicable, such 
additional evidence should be sufficient to sustain a judgment of conviction 
independently of the plea of guilty, or at least to have no room for reasonable 
doubt in the mind of either the trial or the appellate court as to the 
possibility of a misunderstanding on the part of the accused as to the precise 
nature of the charges to which he pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>(6) Notwithstanding what has been said it lies in the sound judicial 
discretion of the trial judge whether he will take evidence or not in any case 
wherein he is satisfied that a plea of 'guilty' has been entered by the accused, 
with full knowledge of the meaning and consequences of his act.</p>
<p>(7) But in the event that no evidence is taken, this court, if, called upon 
to review the proceedings had in the court below, may reverse and send back for 
a new trial, if, on the whole record, a reasonable doubt arises as to whether 
the accused did in fact enter the plea of 'guilty' with full knowledge of the 
meaning and consequences of the act. * * *." (U.S. <em>vs</em>. Jamad, 37 Phil., 
305-318.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly, the better practice in serious cases like the one at bar, is 
already stated in the above quoted pronouncements, but the trial judge must have 
been fully satisfied that the appellants entered the plea of guilty, with full 
knowledge of the meaning and consequences of their act, more so when, as in this 
case, the lives of the appellants were involved. The record does not reveal that 
appellants or counsel ever complained or protested at the time of arraignment 
that they did not understand the information and the effect of their plea of 
guilty.</p>
<p>Conceding for the purposes of argument that the aggravating circumstances of 
use of superior strength or means employed to weaken the defense is absorbed by 
or inherent in treachery, the situation would not alter, because there would 
still be five aggravating circumstances, offset bf one mitigating circumstance 
of the plea of guilty.</p>
<p>Conformably with the foregoing, we find the judgment appealed from to be in 
accordance with the evidence and the law. The same should be, as it is hereby 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Gutierrez David,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed</em>.</p></div>
