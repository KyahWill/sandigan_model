				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. PABLO ISAAC ALIAS JOSE DE JESUS, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is being certified to this Tribunal by the Fifth 
Division of the Court of Appeals by means of a resolution which narrates all the 
pertinent facts and which we reproduce below:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Pablo Isaac <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Jose de Jesus interposed an appeal against 
the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, finding him guilty of the 
crime of qualified theft under Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended 
by Republic Act No. 120, and sentencing him to suffer an indeterminate penalty 
of from 4 years, 2 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> to 9 years, 4 months 
and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>, to the necessary penalties provided by law, and to 
pay the costs. </p>
<p align="justify">"Counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> in his brief does net dispute the 
correctness of the statement of facts in the judgment appealed from, which is as 
follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"From the evidence we find that Licerio Velasquez, physician 
and businessman, was the owner of a jeepney with plate No. AC-2553; on or about 
January 18, 1950, Severino Rodriguez, his chauffeur, having asked for a 
vacation, recommended accused in this case; accused represented himself to be 
named Jose de Jesus; that was on the night of January 18, 1950; he came back the 
next day; and Licerio gave him the jeepney for a "pasada", the agreement being 
that he should return it at night and deliver the sum of P9 to the owner as the 
hire for that period of one day; he did not come back any more; therefore 
Licerio asked Severino to accompany him to the house of Jose de Jesus, herein 
accused; but having located the same, accused's father claimed that he already 
considered the accused as a neglected son because of his previous misconduct; 
further efforts of Licerio to locate him by looking for him in the house of his 
grandfather and in the house of his uncle proved fruitless; therefore they went 
to the secret service and reported the matter, and Pablo Isaac alias Jose de 
Jesus was found by them to be a wanted person according to the records a few 
days afterwards, that is on January 25, 1950, Licerio was informed that his jeep 
was in Tarlac; he reported to the secret service; accompanied by Detectives 
Cunanan, Gonzales and Buenaflor they went to Tarlac and found it in an auto 
repair shop of Mr. Dizon; it turned out that accused had, on the 19th of 
January, 1950, in the afternoon, gone to Tarlac with the jeepney; he contacted 
witness Irineo Noeum, a mechanic, and asked him if he knew a painter who could 
paint the jeepney; witness Nocum accompanied him to the painter named Rosendo 
Wagan, who told accused to come back the next day; the jeepney was left at the 
shop of Mr. Dizon; it was there where the secret service located the same on 
January 21, 1950.<br> </p>
<p align="justify">" 'On his investigation, the accused made a declaration in 
Tagalog which is his language, being Exhibit A; in synthesis, he admitted having 
taken the jeep; that a certain Mrs. Juana Lim had waited for him at Balintawak 
monument; and that on the date in question, January 19, 1950, they proceeded to 
Plaridel, Bulacan, and later to Tarlac, Tarlac, with the jeep.'&nbsp;
</p><p align="justify">"It is, however, contended that under the facts stated above, 
the accused could not be convicted of qualified theft, but at most of the 
lighter crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span>. Therefore, the question herein involved is one of law 
and comes under the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p align="justify">"WHEREFORE, the Fifth Division of this Court RESOLVED to 
refrain from deciding this case and to certify it to the Supreme Court for final 
determination, pursuant to section 17 (6) of Republic Act No. 296, otherwise 
known as the Judiciary Act of 1948."</p></blockquote><p></p>
<p align="justify">The Court of Appeals is right in stating that counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> 
for appellant means to raise only a question of law in this appeal. When said 
counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> says in his brief that "the statement of facts found in the 
decision of the trial court is substantially correct" the Court of Appeals is 
warranted in concluding that said counsel "does not dispute the correctness of 
the statement of facts in the judgment appealed from." But it remains to be 
determined whether said counsel can bind his client, the apellant herein in 
admitting or not disputing the facts as found by the trial court. We entertain 
grave doubts on the matter. A defendant in a criminal case, on appealing from a 
decision of conviction may state in his notice of appeal that he will raise only 
questions of law, in which case it will be presumed that he accepts the findings 
of fact of the trial court; in that case the appeal goes direct to the Supreme 
Court. </p>
<p align="justify">In the present case, however, it does not appear that appellant 
made any such declaration of his intention to raise only questions of law, or 
expressed any tacit acceptance of the facts found by the trial court. He would 
appear to have merely given a general notice of appeal, and the presumption is 
that he would raise questions both of fact and law. That may be the reason why 
the appeal went to the Court of Appeals. May his counsel, specially not a hired 
lawyer selected and appointed by him, but an attorney <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>, not of his 
choosing but appointed by the Court, now admit the facts found by the lower 
court, for him? We do not think so. Under similar circumstances, the appellant 
himself must make the admission of the trial court's findings of fact, 
especially those that are material and decisive, so as to confine the appeal to 
only questions of law for decision.</p>
<p align="justify">As things stand we believe that the present appeal involves 
questions both of law and fact. Consequently, the Court of Appeals has 
jurisdiction over it. The case is hereby remanded to that Court.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</span> 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrador, JJ.</span>, concur.&lt;</div>
