				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of 
Zamboanga, convicting appellant Roque L. Dipay of a violation of section 2703 of 
the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 455, and 
sentencing him to six months imprisonment and a fine of P600, with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs. The case has been 
certified to us by the Court of Appeals on the ground that it involves a 
question of jurisdiction.
<p>The record shows that the case began with the filingr of. an information by 
the City Attorney of Zamboanga charging the appellant with the, violation 
mentioned. Appellant having waived preliminary investigation, he was bound over 
to the Court of. First Instance of Zamboanga, where a special counsel of the 
city filed an information charging him with a violation of section 2303 of the 
Administrative Code (as amended by Republic Act No. 455), alleged to have been 
committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 15th day of August, 1951, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Court, viz., in the City of Zamboanga; Philippines, the above named 
accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and fraudulently 
and knowingly buy 81 cartons of Herald Cigarettes manufactured in the United 
States, the same having been imported contrary to law, thereby depriving the 
Government of the Republic of the Philippines of the lawful duty or any portion 
thereof accruing from the said merchandise."</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the criminal act charged in the body of the information, which is 
that of buying cigarettes knowing that they have been illegally imported, falls 
squarely. under section 2702 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, 
which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 2702. Unlawful importation of merchandise. Any person who shall 
fraudulently or knowingly import or bring into the Philippines, or assist in so 
doing, any merchandise, contrary to law, or shall receive, conceal, buy, sell, 
or in any manner facilitate the transportation, concealment, or sale of such 
merchandise after, importation, knowing the same to have been imported contrary 
to law, shall be punished by a fine of not less.than P600 but not more than 
P5,000 and by imprisonment for not less than 3 months nor more than 2 years and, 
if the offender is an alien, he may be subject to deportation.</p>
<p>"When, upon trial for a violation of this sectlorifthe defendant is shown 
have or to have had possession of the merchandise in question, such possession 
shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction, unless the 
defendant shall explain the possession to the satisfaction of the 
court.</p></blockquote>
<p>The act charged does not come under section 2703 and much less under section 
2303 of the same code, for which reason the triaI court, at the commencement of 
the hearing, allowed the information to be amended by having it stated therein 
that the legal provision violated is section 2702. It was under the information 
as so amended that appellant was tried.</p>
<p>It is clear then that appellant went to trial on a charge that he had 
violated section 2702 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended, by buying 
imported cigarettes knowing them to have been illegally imported But while the 
information alleged that the illegal purchase was made "in the City of Zamboanga 
and the trial was held in that city, the evidence shows that the said illegal 
purchase was made in Sitangkay'in the Province of Sulu.</p>
<p>In the case of Beltran <em>vs</em>. Ramos (50 Off Gaz No 12 p. 5762), this 
Court held that the accused should be tried in the province where the offense 
was committed. The Court said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The repondent contends that the provinces of Occidental and Oriental Mindoro 
constitute the" Eighth Judicial District under the provisions of the Judiciary 
Act of 1948 (Republic Act No. 296). There being: no separate court for the 
Province of Occidental Mindoro, it is claimed that the judge of the district may 
hold his sessions in either of the two provinces. This contention is untenable 
in the present case for the reason that the Rules of Court expressly provide 
that a criminal case should be instituted and tried in the municipality or 
province where the offense was committed or any of its essential ingredients 
took place. This is a fundamental principle, the purpose Being not to compel the 
defendant to move to, and appear in a different court from that of the province 
where the crime was committed, as it would cause him great inconvenience in 
looking for his witnesses and other evidence in another place. Although the 
judge of a district may hold sessions in any part of said district, yet he 
should hold the trial in any particular case subject to the specific provisions 
of section 14(<em>a</em>), Rule 106, in order' not to violate the Rules of Court 
and' disregard the fundamental rights of the accused. Sometimes a judicial 
district includes provinces far distant from each other. Under the theory of 
respondent, the accused may be subjected to the great inconvenience of going to 
a lar distant province with all his witnesses to attend the trial there. This is 
prohibited by the Rules of Court as being unfair to the defendant.</p>
<p>"There is no contradiction between the Judiciary Act and Rule 106, section 
14(<em>a</em>). They should, therefore, be1 enforced together harmoniously." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Conformably to the above ruling, the present case should have been tried in 
Sulu and not in Zamboanga.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is set aside and the case remanded to 
the court below for proper trial. No costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, 
Concepcion,</em> and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
