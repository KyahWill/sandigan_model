TREASON.—All the elements of the crime of treason are 
palpable—Filipino citizenship, treasonable adherence to the enemy with overt 
acts of aid and comfort established by the two-witness rule. The defense is 
meagre. It consists mainly in the unsubstantiated denials of the appellant and 
his protestations of innocence on the ground of duress. However, other than his 
own statements there is no proof of such duress. On the contrary, the narration 
of arrests made by Japanese in which appellant participated, clearly shows a 
voluntariness and deliberation in his conduct that could not have been so 
naturally produced by force. The other testimonies presented by the defense are 
based on the lack of knowledge of the witnesses that appellant was a 
<i>Makapili</i> and that he acted as one. In short, there is no proof of 
innocence to offset the prosecution's substantial case. <i>Held:</i> Appellant 
is guilty of treason.</div>
