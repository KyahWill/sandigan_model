				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before&nbsp; the court&nbsp; of first instance of Cagayan, the defendants Maxima Orpilla-Molina, et al., were charged with having committed indirect contempt of the justice of the peace court of&nbsp; Alcala, Cagayan, because&nbsp; they&nbsp; unlawfully re-entered the&nbsp; land&nbsp; from which they had. been&nbsp; previously ejected by the&nbsp; sheriff in virtue of a final decision&nbsp; of said inferior court.<br><br>They raised the question&nbsp; of jurisdiction,&nbsp; pointing out that the punishment provided for such contempt in section 6 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court&nbsp; was a fine not exceeding P100 or imprisonment for not more than one month or both.&nbsp; Such penalty,&nbsp; they contended, fell beyond the original jurisdiction of courts&nbsp; of first instance.<br><br>Over the fiscal's objection, the court sustained&nbsp; defendants'&nbsp; contention and dismissed the complaint in its order of June&nbsp; 29, 1957.<br><br>Hence, this appeal,&nbsp; which&nbsp; we&nbsp; find&nbsp; to be meritorious. Although Republic Act 296 assigned to the justice of the peace courts all criminal&nbsp; offenses penalized with imprisonment for not more than&nbsp; six months or a fine not exceeding P200 or both,&nbsp; this case must&nbsp; be deemed not&nbsp; included in such assignment because under section 4 of Rule 64, proceedings for contempt committed&nbsp; against a justice of the peace court "<i>may be instituted</i>" either in the court of first instance or in such justice of the peace court.<br><br>Rule 64&nbsp; is as much a law&nbsp; as&nbsp; Republic Act 296; and both should be contrued and upheld together, if&nbsp; possible, by making the former an exception to the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeals are not favored, the authorities agree.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; this contempt constituted&nbsp; at bottom a civil contempt, as&nbsp; distinguished from a criminal&nbsp; one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; True, the&nbsp; proceeding is penal in nature as we have heretofore, held,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>; yet it would seem reasonable, considering their&nbsp; true purpose,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> not&nbsp; to classify civil&nbsp; contempts&nbsp; among those ordinary&nbsp; criminal cases&nbsp; alloted to inferior courts by the&nbsp; Judiciary&nbsp; Act&nbsp; of 1948. Upon further reflection&nbsp; it will be&nbsp; noted, in line&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Solicitor General's observation, that adoption of appellees'&nbsp; viewpoint would&nbsp; result&nbsp; in depriving courts&nbsp; of first instance of jurisdiction to punish direct contempts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> against them, and of disabling them effectively to enforce their&nbsp; orders with the&nbsp; consequent loss of their&nbsp; inherent right&nbsp; of self-preservation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; their&nbsp; power to&nbsp; compel obedience to their commands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the appealed order is&nbsp; hereby reversed and the record&nbsp; remanded to the court below for further proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against appellees.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
