				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. NICASIO CAMINERO, ET AL., DEFENDANTS, MANUEL PAKINGAN, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In an amended information, Nicasio Caminero alias Nicasio 
Camerino, Manuel Pakingan, Emilio Martin alias Emiliong Pintong Bato, Antonio 
Martinez, Aurelio Ilas, Miguel Topacio, Crisanto Saratan, Arsenio Corcillo, 
Raymundo Advincula, Emilio Silvestre, Bienvenido Osteria and John Doe were 
charged with the crime of murder before the Court of First Instance of Cavite. 
Nicasio Carminero alias Nicasio Camerino pleaded guilty upon arraignment, and 
was accordingly sentenced. Eight of the defendants being still at large, the 
hearing proceeded as against Manuel Pakingan, Crisanto Saratan and Bienvenido 
Osteria. After the trial, the lower court acquitted the latter two for 
insufficiency of evidence against them and for lack of proof of conspiracy, but 
convicted Manuel Pakingan and sentenced him life imprisonment as well as to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P4,000, whereupon Manuel 
Pakingan appealed claiming that the lower court erred: <p></p>
<ol><li>in finding that most of the prosecution witnesses recognized Pakingan and 
that he was definitely identified by Sabina Torres and Virginia 
Gawaran-Nario;<br><br>
</li><li>in admitting as evidence Exhibit "I", an affidavit allegedly signed by 
appellant Pakingan at the national Bureau of Investigation Office in Manila;<br><br>
</li><li>in rejecting the defense of alibi interposed by defendant-appellant;<br><br>
</li><li>in concluding that Manuel Pakingan killed Cesareo Gawaran for some ulterior 
motives not of his own and may be upon superior orders; and<br><br>
</li><li>in finding Pakingan guilty of the crime of murder beyond reasonable doubt. 
</li></ol>
<p>It clearly appears from the evidence on record that on the election day of 
November 10, 1953, between 12:30 and 1:00 o' clock noon, Cesareo Gawaran, a 
sexagenarian and a diehard Nacionalista partyman, was in bed peacefully reading 
a newspaper in a room on the ground floor of his two-story house situated near 
the seashore in the barrio of Digmaan, municipality of Bacoor, province of 
Cavite. While his family was gathered in the living room on the ground floor, a 
man armed with a long firearm appeared at the window fronting the sea and 
inquired if that was the place where Cesareo Gawaran lived. The three adult 
members of the Gawaran family, namely, his son Augustc, his daughter Virginia 
Gawaran-Nario, and his niece Sabina Torres, were taken aback and speechless as 
the gun was pointed at Augusto. Then another man with a scar on the left 
forehead, also with a long gun, appeared at the door and twice called out 
angrily and in a harsh tone of voice, "Cesareo, lumabas ka" (come out, Cesareo). 
The man at the window was Nicasio Caminero who pleaded guilty, and the one at 
the door was appellant Manuel Pakingan, On second call of Pakingan, the old 
Gawaran, newspaper in hand, came to the living room; whereupon appellant told 
him that they would like to talk to him outside the house. To this, Gawaran 
willingly consented. Caminero then joined Pakingan at the door and both led the 
old man outside, each holding him by the arm between them. Sensing that 
something untoward might happen to her father, Virginia followed them, but no 
sooner had she gone out of the door than another man, identified as Arsenio 
Corcillo (still at large) poked his gun at her and prevented her from following 
her father. She ran towards the back of the house and headed to a neighboring 
yard, from where she watched through the of the bamboo fence of the neighbor's 
yard and saw that, while her father was at standstill, Caminero a shot which 
felled her father, and immediately appellant Pakingan fired four successive 
shots at the prostrate old man, and thereafter both gunmen left the scene. 
Another man who was identified as Saratan, (he acquitted) approached and viewed 
the body. Virginia was just about fifteen meters away, then ran to her father 
who was already dead, crying "Father is dead," Augusto Gawaran and other members 
of the Gawaran household came to where the deceased fell. When autopsied on the 
following day by Dr. Pedro P. Solis of the NBI, five gunshot wounds were found 
on Gawaran's body, one of which was on the left breast, the bullet lacerating 
the heart and lungs which caused instantaneous death.</p>
<p>Gawaran's house in the barrio of Digmaan is situated near the seashore, the 
Manila Bay to its North and fishponds to its South. Just a short distance to the 
West is Muling Pagsilang street that runs straight from the provincial road 
towards the seashore, that is to say, from South to North. This street is the 
only ordinary passage to the barrio of Digmaan from the provincial road, and 
along the way one has to pass the end of Ocampo, Martinez and Patol streets, in 
the order stated, which are at right angles with and which end in Muling 
Pagsilang street, as shown by sketch Exhibit D. One also can just walk along the 
beach hugging the shoreline from the westerly direction, which is the hard way, 
or pass along the fishponds from the South to reach the Gawaran residence.</p>
<p>On that election day, the political atmosphere of Bacoor was tense and 
foreboding, for, earlier that morning, vice-mayor Ocampo of Bacoor who belonged 
to the Nacionalista Party, together with some companions were massacred by 
gunmen in the barrio of Kaiñgin, at about 10:30, just about twenty meters from 
electoral precinct No. 5 of Bacoor. This led Emiliano Gawaran, one of the sons 
of the deceased, who was then the Naclonalista inspector in that precinct, to go 
immediately to Manila to report the matter to the Commission on Elections. Upon 
his return to Bacoor at noon, he found that precinct No. 5 was deserted, so he 
alighted from the passenger jeepney at a place two "callejones" from the 
municipal building, went to the seashore and then walked eastward along the 
beach towards his house. But when he reached Muling Pagsilang street at about 
four houses distant from his residence, he heard four or five shots which made 
him run under the house of Mateo Ogalino to seek cover. This house is in the 
corner of Muling Pagsilang and an unnamed street near the beach which was marked 
as Exhibit H in the sketch Exhibit D. While thus under the house, he saw eight 
armed men with buri hats coming from his place and were heading towards Muling 
Pagsilang, recognizing five of them, namely, Emilio Martin, Corcillo, Caminero, 
Pakingan and Saratan. He already knew appellant before that, as he knew him to 
be a boxer and had seen him once or twice in the ring; besides, he also knew him&nbsp; in the rotonda of Imus where appellant was known as 'kikil."</p>
<p>Atty. Delfin Gawaran, another son of the deceased, after casting his vote at 
a precinct near the municipal building at about 11:00 o'clock, was stopped in 
his car by two policemen who requested him to take them to the barrio of Kaiñgin 
where there had been a shooting earlier that morning, but upon their reaching 
the place of one Mr. Narvaez, they were told not to proceed anymore as there 
were gunmen in town hunting for Nacionalista leaders. The policemen got off the 
car and Atty. Gawaran proceeded to the house of ex-governor Trias, another 
Nacionalista, to warn him and his family of the prevailing danger. This house is 
about 200 meters from the Gawaran residence. The attorney was then apprehensive 
as he had seen some three jeeploads of gunmen pass in town after he had learned 
of the Ocampo massacre. After shutling in his car some three times from the 
ex-governor's house to his residence, Atty. Gawaran was prevailed upon by his 
neighbors to stay and hide in the store of Lorenza Santiago at the corner of 
Patol and Muling Pagsilang streets, which is just 100 or 150 meters from the 
Gawaran residence. <u>It was then about 12:15 noon when, while in that store, he 
saw some nine or ten armed men which came from the direction of the municipal 
building, walking along Muling Pagsilang and heading towards the Gawaran place</u>. In 
fear, he went upstairs and peeped through a hole in the window, and saw the 
chief of police Bienvenido Osteria among them. The gunmen tarried in the store 
for a while asking some questions from the neighbors, and then proceeded towards 
Digmaan, leaving Osteria in the store. Eased somehow of his fears upon seeing 
his friend Osteria, Atty. Gawaran came from his hiding place upstairs down to 
the store and was greeted by Osteria. They had a friendly conversation and the 
attorney was told by Osteria that the men who had just passed were the agents of 
the Governor on a scouting mission. Soon the mother of Atty. Gawaran came 
running, crying and shouting at him to hide because she had just met the armed 
men going to their house, and at that same moment several shots were heard. 
Atty. Gawaran asked Osteria what those shots were and was told that the 
Governor's agents were just having some target practice, but at the same time 
Osteria told him to run and hide himself; whereupon Atty. Gawaran ran to the 
house of his compadre, Arsenio Guinto, and transferred to the house of Marcelo 
Landas. He stayed in the latter's house till late afternoon where he was found 
by Manila newspapermen, who informed him that his father was dead. He wanted to 
see his father, but the newspapermen hid him instead in their car and whisked 
him to Manila, telling him that it was perilous for him to be seen in town by 
reason of the fact that armed men were looking for Nacionalista leaders. Upon 
reaching Manila and upon instructions of the then president-elect Ramon 
Magsaysay, Atty. Gawaran was interviewed by reporters, which was radiocast.</p>
<p>The armed group which went to the barrio of Digmaan at noon that election day 
was seen by neighbors of the vicinity, among them Ricardo Almeda, an employee of 
the Bureau of Labor, who testified that while he was in front of his house at 
Calle Martinez, he saw eight or ten armed men coming from the direction of the 
municipal building, and walking along Martinez street toward Muling Pagsilang. 
He went upstairs and peeped through a window as they passed so as to identify 
them, as he had already heard about the Kaingin killing before that. He 
recognized the chief of police Osteria among them, and he saw that upon reaching 
Muling Pagsilang they turned towards Digmaan. After they had passed, Almeda 
stayed again in front of his house, and later saw the same group taking the same 
route on their way back.</p>
<p>Another neighbor, <u>Marciano</u> <u>Pusieran</u>, who was at the store of a certain Aling 
Tacion at the corner of Martinez and Muling Pagsilang, was chatting with 
Gregorio Mateo and other neighbors, the subject being the killing of vice-mayor 
Ocampo and his men. That noon, he saw the same armed group - nine of them - 
deployed on both sides of the street as they were coming along Martinez street 
and <u>heading</u> <u>towards</u> <u>Digmaan</u>. He recognized chief of police Osteria who was at 
the tail-end, as well as <u>Pakingan</u>, Corcillo, and <u>Caminero</u>. While they were 
walking, he heard Corcillo say in a loud voice, "Let the chief go ahead because 
he knows the place." Pusieran had a good look at appellant who was then wearing 
a white T-shirt and noticed a scar on his forehead as well as small pimples on 
his face. Shortly thereafter, he heard several successive shots coming from the 
direction of Digmaan, and again saw the same persons, now walking fast on their 
way back, Osteria heading straight along Muling Pagsilang to the provincial road 
after waiving a handkerchief to his companions who turned towards Martinez 
street.</p>
<p>Testifying in his defense, appellant limited himself to denying the facts 
testified to by prosecution witnesses. He denied having gone to Bacoor at noon 
on November 10th, 1953; that he never went to Gawaran's house; he has never been 
with Caminero on that day, nor on any day, although he knows him to be a 
"wanted" man; he was not with the chief of police Osteria on that day either, 
nor knows him personally; he did not have a long firearm on that day; he does 
not know Pusieran, Virginia Gawaran and the other witnesses for the prosecution. 
He admitted, however, that he knows Saratan because both of them are from the 
barrio of Anabu, municipality of Imus. In addition to his testimony, his counsel 
presented, without objection on the part of the fiscal, the transcript of his 
former testimony in Criminal Case No. 11653 of the court of first instance of 
Cavite, entitled People vs. Dominador Camerino, et al., for sedition (Exhibit 
4-Pakingan), wherein he testified that on November 10, 1953, he was in his house 
situated in the barrio of Anabu, attending to his wife who had just had a baby; 
that he did not go out of Anabu for three days; that on that election day he was 
seen and had conversation in the street with councilor Remigio Reyes of Imus who 
asked him if he had already voted, to which he answered in the negative; that he 
was seen in his house by Jacinto Purificacion who persuaded him to vote, but 
that he could not leave the house on account of his ill wife. To corroborate 
appellant's testimony, his counsel likewise marked as Exhibit 5-Pakingan the 
transcript of the testimony of Remigio Reyes in Criminal Case No. 11653 
mentioned above, and as Exhibit 6-Pakingan the transcript of the testimony of 
Jacinto Purificacion in the same criminal case. We find, however, that although 
the said two exhibits were admitted by the trial court (35, t.s.n., Villanueva), 
the same were not attached to the record, and according to the minutes of the 
hearing of May 25, 1954, certified copies of said exhibits 5-Pakingan and 
6-Pakingan were yet to be presented, and as a matter of fact they were not 
presented at all nor sent to this Court, as shown by the index of exhibits 
certified to by Ponciano F. Martinez, clerk of the court of first instance of 
Cavite. We have, therefore, that appellants defense consisted merely in his 
uncorroborated testimony.</p>
<p>In view of the alibi put up by appellant and his denial of the acts imputed 
upon him, we have carefully examined the record relative to his identification. <br></p><p><u>Virginia</u> <u>Gawaran</u>-<u>Nario</u>, the eyewitness to the shooting, positively identified 
appellant as the gunman who appeared at the door of their house, her attention 
having been arrested by the scar on his left forehead just above the left 
eyebrow (143, t.s.n., Miranda); she had opportunity to observe his face three 
times: first, when she saw him at the door; second, when he held the arm of the 
deceased and led him outside; and third, when he shot the old man (1, t.s.n., 
Matro). Evidently the features of appellant made a deep impression on her for, 
when she was investigated by a P.C. officer that same afternoon, she gave a good 
description of the killers: Pakingan as having a scar on the left forehead, and 
Caminero as having gold teeth and thick eyebrows (163, t.s.n., Miranda). After 
appellant's arrest about a month later, she again identified him in a line-up at 
the P.C, barracks in Imus, and that was the first time that she ever knew that 
his name was Pakingan (169, t.s.n, Miranda). And to cap it all, she stated that 
even without the telltale scar, still she recognized him by his face and 
features (170, t. s. n., Miranda),</p>
<p><u>Sabina</u> <u>Torres</u>, who was also in the living room with Virginia on that 
occasion, had a good look at appellant and noticed his scar when he appeared at 
the door (82, t.s.n., Miranda). Again she identified him in the municipal 
building of Bacoor after his arrest (85, t.s.n., Miranda), and at the trial of 
the case she did not hesitate to point him out to the court.</p>
<p>Aside from these two eyewitnesses, we have the testimony of <u>Emiliano</u> <u>Gawaran</u> 
who positively identified appellant and four others as among the eight armed men 
who were <u>coming from the scene of the crime right after he heard the series of 
shots</u> (25, t.s.n., Matro). Witness could not have been mistaken in his 
identification of appellant as, according to him, he long knew Pakingan as a 
boxer and had seen him in the ring (25, t.s.n., Matro); besides, he used to see 
him in the rotonda or plaza of Imus where appellant is known as "kikil" (35, 
t.s.n., Mafcro). As a matter of fact, witness was instrumental to the 
apprehension of appellant in the house of a certain Poling in the barrio of 
Aniban, Bacoor, for, sometime after the 10th of November, 1953, he saw appellant 
in a cockpit and "tailed" him, which finally led to his arrest by ten P.C. men 
and two NBI's, witness accompanying the arresting party. (25, t.s.n., 
Matro).</p>
<p><u>Marciano</u> <u>Pusieran</u>, a resident of the vicinity, positively told the court that 
he recognized appellant as one of those armed men that went to the barrio of 
Digmaan, and remembered not only his scar on the forehead but also the small 
pimples on his face (198, t.s.n., Miranda). Again he recognized him when he saw 
appellant, after the latter's arrest, in the P.C. barracks in Imus (200, t.s.n., 
Miranda). On cross-examination, he assured the court that he remembered 
appellant by his very face and that although Pakingan be shown to him attired 
differently from the white T-shirt he was wearing at that time, still he could 
recognize him by his face and by his hair (19, t.s.n., Matro), and when asked by 
defense counsel to show how appellant wore his hat on that occasion, he 
demonstrated it to the court in such a way that not only the "patilla" of the 
haircut could be seen, but that the hair itself on the forehead was visible (20, 
t.s.n., Matro).<br><br>We entertain absolutely no doubt that between 12:30 and 
1:00 o'clock noon on the election day of November 10, 1953, a group of armed men 
coming from the direction of the municipal building of Bacoor, appellant among 
them, went to the barrio of Digmaan by passing along Martinez street, then to 
Muling Pagsilang, and after reaching the shore turned right to the residence of 
the deceased. Once there, triggermen Caminero and appellant Pakingan took him 
out of the house and killed him on the beach, Caminero firing the first shot when Gawaran was at a standstill, and Pakingan finishing him off by a series of 
shots when the victim was already sprawled on the ground. The Bacoor killings 
acquired national notoriety through the radio and newspapers (Exhibit C), and 
although there is no positive evidence on record as to the real motive behind 
the killing of the deceased, the testimony of witnesses strongly indicate that 
politics had much to do with it.</p>
<p>Appellant points out in his brief that the trial court erred in "admitting as 
evidence" Exhibit I (a written statement by appellant before the NBI wherein he 
admits having gone to Bacoor on that election day and arrived there at 1:30 
p.m.) on the ground that it has not been formally offered by the prosecution. 
The transcript of the evidence really reveals that Exhibit I has not been 
mentioned as among the exhibits offered (39, t.s.n., Matro), although there 
appears an instruction by the court to the fiscal that the latter could just 
present it (345 t.s.n., Villanueva), which was not complied with. We agree with 
appellant that this exhibit should not have been considered by the trial court 
in the weighing of the evidence.</p>
<p>However, even brushing Exhibit I aside, the defense of alibi put up by 
appellant is nothing but a flimsy excuse against the overwhelming force of the 
evidence for the prosecution, for at least four credible witnesses have 
sufficiently established his presence and placed him at the scene of the crime 
and its immediate vicinity prior to, during, and soon after its perpetration. 
His contention that he did not leave his house in the barrio of Anabu for three 
days because of his ill wife, is not at all incompatible with his having gone to 
Bacoor on the day and time testified to by prosecution witnesses, as Bacoor and 
Imus are contiguous towns, of which judicial notice may be taken, connected by a 
first-class road, and the barrio of Anabu and Imus, according to appellant 
himself, is just at the roadside. There is no showing, either, that it was 
impossible for him to be at Bacoor on the day and time in question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rule is well settled that the defense of alibi can merit but a scant 
consideration if the presence of the accused appears sufficiently established by 
credible and reliable witnesses. Considering that the accused had not only been 
sufficiently identified, but the role they have played has been well depicted by 
the witnesses, and there is nothing that can detract from their testimony which 
the lower court found them to be truthful, the defense of alibi cannot be 
sustained." (People vs. Caubat, et al., No. L-7585, June 23, 1955).</p>
<p>"Where the accused had been positively identified by witnesses who recognized 
his features and identity, one of whom was even the husband of the sister of the 
wife of the accused and where no motive has been shown on the part of said 
prosecution witnesses that would have prompted them to testify falsely, the 
defense of alibi set up by the accused cannot overcome the testimony of the 
prosecution witnesses." (People vs. Baltazar, et al., No. L-5850, Jan. 4, 
1956).</p>
<p>"The defense of alibi of the accused cannot prevail over the testimony of 
eyewitnesses to the incident wherein the accused had participated especially 
where the testimony of such witnesses are trustworthy, stating in detail the 
participation of the accused had in carrying the plan for liquidating the victim 
and also witnesses who positively identified the appellant as one of those who 
went into the house of the victim to fetch the victim moments before the 
murder." (People vs. Umali, et al., No. L-8399, May 11, 1956).</p>
<p>"The defense of alibi is the weakest defense that an accused can avail of, 
and cannot prosper where the accused has been positively and properly identified 
by the offended party; and alibi should be proven by proper evidence which would 
reasonably satisfy the court of the truth of such defense (U.S. vs. Oxiles, 29 
Phil.,337). Oral proof of alibi must be clearly and satisfactorily established 
because it is so easily manufactured and usually so unreliable that it cannot be 
given credit (People vs. Badila, et al., 48 Phil. 710)." (People vs. Moro Sarabi 
alias Gabriel Macrohon, et al., No. L-8054, September 21, 
1956).</p></blockquote>
<p>The Solicitor General recommends the imposition of the death penalty, 
alleging the presence of three aggravating circumstances which are not offset by 
any mitigating circumstance, namely: treachery, dwelling and abuse of superior 
strength, which appear to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, the evidence 
on record clearly showing that the deceased was taken from his house, brought to 
a neighbor's yard and there killed; that when the deceased was ordered by 
Pakingan to come out of his room and he approached the latter, his right arm was 
held by appellant while Caminero took hold of his left arm, and thus held he was 
taken to a nearby yard 5 while at a standstill, he was fired upon by - Caminero 
causing him to fall, and while sprawled on the ground, appellant fired at him 
four successive shots which caused his instantaneous death.</p>
<p>The Solicitor General holds the view that the crime at bar is murder 
qualified by treachery with the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior 
strength and dwelling, but it having been repeatedly held by this Court that the 
abuse of superior strength is merged in the qualifying circumstance of 
treachery, among the three aforementioned aggravating1circumstances, only 
dwelling should be considered as such. But besides dwelling, there is the 
aggravating circumstance of disregard of the respect due the offended party on 
account of his age, for he was a sexagenarian when killed by the appellant who 
was then 27 years old. And there being no mitigating circumstance that may 
offset the above-mentioned aggravating circumstance and taking into account the 
savagery with which the crime at bar was committed, we agree with the Solicitor 
General's view that the herein appellant deserves the supreme penalty of 
death.</p>
<p>As to the Solicitor General's recommendation that the indemnity to be paid by 
appellant be raised to P6,000, we find it well taken. (People vs. Banlos, G. R. 
No. L-3413, Dec. 29, 1955; People vs. Villareal, G. R. No. L- 3545, Dec. 29, 
1953; People vs. Simbulan and Isip, G. R. No. L-5299, June 30, 1952).</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby modified and the appellant 
sentenced to suffer the<br>the penalty of death and to pay P6,000,00 to the 
heirs of the deceased Cesareo Gawaran, and the proportionate costs.</p>
