				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div r.="" no.="" l-10022.Â ="" january="" 31,="" 1958]="" align="justify.[G.">This&nbsp; is an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations dated November 10,&nbsp; 1955, ordering&nbsp; the&nbsp; reinstatement&nbsp; of Antonio Alcantara,&nbsp; a member of&nbsp; the respondent,&nbsp; National Labor Union,&nbsp; without back wages. <br><br>It appears&nbsp; that Antonio Alcantara&nbsp; was dismissed by the petitioner, Northern Motors, Inc.,&nbsp; on&nbsp; June 12,&nbsp; 1953. Respondent&nbsp; Union&nbsp; contested the dismissal&nbsp; and brought the case before the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; After hearing, Antonio Alcantara was&nbsp; found to have smoked in the painting booth of the petitioner, contrary to its rules and regulations, and was declared to have&nbsp; been justifiably dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting upon a motion for reconsideration filed by&nbsp; respondent Union, the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> affirmed the&nbsp; findings of the trial judge but changed the order of&nbsp; dismissal to that of reinstatement without back wages.&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Martinez dissented,&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground that no reason has&nbsp; been shown for&nbsp; the&nbsp; reinstatement. The petitioner has appealed. <br><br>The only question that arises&nbsp; is whether&nbsp; or not the act of&nbsp; which&nbsp; Antonio Alcantara was&nbsp; found guilty is&nbsp; a just cause for dismissal.&nbsp; It has&nbsp; been&nbsp; proved and is not disputed that&nbsp; Alcantara was an experienced painter and, having worked with&nbsp; the petitioner for some time, he knew that smoking&nbsp; in a painting booth is extremely hazardous. Such&nbsp; smoking has been shown to be&nbsp; dangerous, because the painting booth&nbsp; contained&nbsp; inflammable dusts and&nbsp; materials and there were painters who could&nbsp; proceed to take up&nbsp; a spray gun and paint without warning, thereby multiplying the&nbsp; danger&nbsp; of&nbsp; conflagration&nbsp; from any&nbsp; flame. Indeed, the petitioner insisted in&nbsp; the rule against smoking in&nbsp; the painting&nbsp; booth to protect the very&nbsp; lives&nbsp; of its employees,&nbsp; especially&nbsp; those in&nbsp; the painting booth.&nbsp; We are constrained to hold that Alcantara's offense was&nbsp; grave and warranted his dismissal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order of reinstatement complained&nbsp; of&nbsp; was&nbsp; obviously based&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; sympathy&nbsp; and no&nbsp; back wages having been awarded. <br><br>Consistently with the policy of promoting the welfare of&nbsp; labor, the interest of justice demands that capital&nbsp; should not be abused.&nbsp; Were, as in this case, the employer imposed&nbsp; and&nbsp; insisted&nbsp; in a regulation&nbsp; designed for&nbsp; the safety of&nbsp; the laborers themselves,&nbsp; a violation thereof by the latter is&nbsp; a&nbsp; just&nbsp; cause for outright dismissal which in effect protects&nbsp; labor and at the same&nbsp; time&nbsp; gives capital its due. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision appealed from&nbsp; is hereby&nbsp; reversed and&nbsp; the dismissal&nbsp; of Antonio Alcantara&nbsp; declared to have&nbsp; been for&nbsp; a&nbsp; just cause.&nbsp; So ordered&nbsp; without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J.
