				<BR><STRONG>JUGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appellant  Arturo  R. Silo was accused  before the Court of First Instance of Manila of  the  crime of estafa  upon an information, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That in, about and during the period comprised between August 28, 1951, and November 27, 1951,  in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said  accused  did  then and  there  willfully,  unlawfully  and feloniously defraud the United  States Tobacco Corporation, received cigarettes valued at P3,172 to be sold  by him and under the express obligation to account for and deliver the proceeds of the sale thereof, if sold,  or to return  the  said articles,  if not sold;  but the said accused,  far  from  complying  With  his  aforesaid  obligation  and despite repeated demands  made upon him to do  so, accounted  for the sum of P2,127.65  only, and  with intent to defraud, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously misappropriated, misapplied and converted the rest, to his own personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of  the U. S.  Tobacco Corporation in the amount of P1,044.35, Philippine currency".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>The following facts were found proven by Judge Conrado V. Sanchez, Presiding Judge of said Court.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * From May, 1951, up to January 17, 1952, the defendant was a saleman of the U. S.  Tobacco Corporation  whose duty was to sell cigarettes of  the corporation  in Manila and environments.  He used to  get the products from the warehouse of the U. S. Tobacco Corporation after obtaining an official delivery permit to withdraw the  same. He was under obligation  to sell the stocks issued to him and to turn  over  the proceeds thereof  to the cashier of the corporation.  All cash received by defendant  had to be turned over to the corporation on the same  days, unless reasonably  delayed. "* * * From August 28,  1951, and November  27, 1951, defendant sold to diverse customers  cigarettes of the total value of P8,487.80. Out of these sales Silo turned over in cash and in  stocks the total amount  of P5,880.05.  There  is  due from the customers the sum of Pl,562.50.  Deducting the  sums  of P5,880.95, and P1,562.50, or a total of P7,443.45 from the total  amount of P8,487.80, there remains a total  of P1,044.35".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Auditor Gregorio  Twano of the corporation and defendant Silo examined the accounts of the different customers, and it  was  found that  the  defendant could  not account for the different sums he had collected from the customers. The defendant  signed an  admission that he  had  kept the different amounts for himself without turning  them  over to the  corporation nor advising  the company of the collections.  The amount of the  shortage is, as already stated, P1,044.35.</p>
<p>The  Judge found  him  guilty of  the  crime  of  estafa  as charged, and sentenced  him to  suffer an  indeterminate penalty of from 2 months and 1 day of arresto  mayor to 1 year  and 1  day  of p<span style="font-style: italic;">rision correctional,</span> to  indemnify the U.  S. Tobacco Corporation in the amount of P1,044.35, with  subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the  costs.</p>
<p>The defendant  appealed to the Court of Appeals, but as he raises a question of law only, the case was certified by said Court to this Court.</p>
<p>The defendant-appellant makes the only  assignment of error as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"El juzgado inferior  incurrio en error al no  especificar, clara y distintamente, en su sentencia la disposicion penal por la cual ha sido  procesado el acusado  y bajo  que articulo  del  codigo penal revisado ha sido sentenciado y condenado.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that under the facts stated as proven, the  Court  of First  Instance  found the appellant  guilty of the crime of  estafa.  Estafa is a  well-known  crime not only to lawyers but also to the community in general, and  especially to businessmen and business agents.   Then the  court imposed the  penalty ranging  from 2 months and  1 day  of  <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto  mayor</span> to 1 year  and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional.</span> This  penalty  would  also  indicate the  kind of  estafa  committed.  It  was  not  necessary, therefore, for  the court to  specify the particular article and  paragraph of the  Revised Penal Code, which have been violated by the appellant.  There  are cases  where the law or legal principle involved is not obvious or  clear. It is those cases that it would be necessary for  the  court to specify the particular statute  or principle violated. On the other hand,  where  the statute or principle concerned is so clear and obvious, as in the present case, and  is really understood from the  facts,  the conclusion and  the  penalty imposed, an  express specification of the statute or an exposition of the law is not necessary.</p>
<p>Section 2 of  Rule  116 of the Rules of Court provides, among other things, that a judgment in a criminal case shall contain clearly and  distinctively a statement  of the facts proved  or  admitted  by  the  defendant and  upon which the judgment is based.  If the judgment   is of conviction,  it  shall  state the legal  qualification  of the offense, the aggravating or  mitigating circumstances, the participation of the  defendant in the commission  of the offense, and the penalty as well as the civil  liability. In the present case, the judgment appealed  from states the  qualification  of the  offense as  <em>estafa </em>and fixes the penalty and the civil liability of the defendant. It does not  state the  aggravating  or mitigating  circumstances, because there  are  none  to  speak of.  It does  not  state whether  the defendant  acted  as principal, accomplice  or accessory, for the case is so simple that it is evident that the defendant acted as principal.  The commission of these details shows  that when they  are  evident   and clearly understood, it is not necessary  to express them. The same thing happens  with the particular  paragraph and  article of the Revised  Penal Code concerned, for they are clearly understood from the  facts stated,  the legal  qualification thereof  and  the penalty imposed  by the  court  below. However, for the sake of clearness, we may add here that the legal provision violated is Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, paragraph 3rd in connection with paragraph 4th,  subparagraph  (<em>b</em>), of the  same article, for conversion or misappropriation.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point,  in  the case of  United  States vs. Mendoza, 14 Phil., 202, the court said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"With reference to the second assignment of error that the  lower court failed to designate in his decision the provision of law violated, it is  true that the sentence of the lower court does not indicate the particular  provision of law  violated by the defendants.  This was not error, however, if  the lower court did actually apply the proper provision of the Penal Code to the parts established  by  the  proof during the trial of the case."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the decision  appealed  from  does  not  specify the particular article  and paragraph of the Revised Penal Code,  violated,  it  can not be  held void for  that reason as claimed by the appellant, because it was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.   (Crispulo Talabon<em> vs.</em> The  Iloilo Provincial  Warden, 44  Off. Gaz.,  No.  11,  p. 4326.)</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is  affirmed, with  costs  against the appellant.   It  is  so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L.</em>, and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
