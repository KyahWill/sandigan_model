				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; which seeks to enjoin respondent Judge from enforcing the preliminary&nbsp; injunction issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; him against the&nbsp; members&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioning union&nbsp; restraining them from&nbsp; exercising acts&nbsp; of&nbsp; violence and&nbsp; intimidation in and around&nbsp; the&nbsp; premises&nbsp; of the San Miguel&nbsp; Brewery Box Factory&nbsp; located&nbsp; in Mandaluyong, Rizal instituted by&nbsp; co-respondent Gonzalo Sanchez against the members of the same union and other sympathizing with them for damages arising from said&nbsp; acts of violence and intimidation on the ground that said respondent Judge does not have jurisdiction to act thereon&nbsp; involving as&nbsp; it does an unfair labor practice that comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Eelations.<br><br>On August 22, 1957, one Gonzalo Sanchez filed an action before the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rizal&nbsp; against the members&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; San&nbsp; Miguel&nbsp; Brewery&nbsp; Box&nbsp; Factory Workers'&nbsp; Union, hereinafter referred to as union, seeking to&nbsp; enjoin&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; from&nbsp; committing certain acts&nbsp;&nbsp; of violence,&nbsp; intimidation&nbsp; and other&nbsp; unlawful acts in&nbsp; and around&nbsp; the premises&nbsp; of the&nbsp; San Miguel&nbsp; Brewery Box Factory located&nbsp; in Mandaluyong,&nbsp; Rizal,&nbsp; and to recover certain&nbsp; damages arising from the commission of&nbsp; the aforesaid unlawful acts&nbsp; (Civil Case No. 4655).&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; was alleged that plaintiff is the contractor of the&nbsp; San Miguel Brewery, Inc.&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; manufacture&nbsp; and&nbsp; repair&nbsp; of&nbsp; wooden boxes for&nbsp; all&nbsp; the products of said corporation&nbsp; with the&nbsp; condition that&nbsp; he&nbsp; would furnish the labor&nbsp; but the&nbsp; materials and the place of&nbsp; the factory would be provided for by the&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp; It was also alleged that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant union is an organization of laborers&nbsp; who&nbsp; were contracted by the plaintiff to work in the factpry, the plaintiff having acted only as an independent contractor.<br><br>On May 4,&nbsp; 1947, the members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; union went on strike without giving previous&nbsp; notice to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; or to the&nbsp; Conciliation Service&nbsp; of the Department of Labor and, together with other&nbsp; members of the Philippine Association of Free Labor Union with&nbsp; which the union was affiliated,&nbsp; formed&nbsp; picket lines&nbsp; along the&nbsp; streets leading to&nbsp; the&nbsp; box factory thereby&nbsp; preventing the&nbsp; non-striking laborers and other&nbsp; employees of the corporation from working in&nbsp; the factory and&nbsp; making deliveries of&nbsp; the materials manufactured therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 2, 1957, an agreement was entered into between the union and the plaintiff setting&nbsp; forth the&nbsp; conditions under which the&nbsp; striking laborers would&nbsp; agree to return to work,&nbsp; and after the agreement was executed, said laborers did in&nbsp; fact return to work, but on August&nbsp; 8, 1957, in violation of the agreement, the members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; union went again on&nbsp; strike and&nbsp; started picketing&nbsp; again the&nbsp; streets&nbsp; and&nbsp; premises where the factory is&nbsp; situated and in connection with said picketing, they performed and committed certain acts of violence and intimidation with the aim in view of preventing,&nbsp; as&nbsp; they did&nbsp; prevent, the non-striking laborers&nbsp; and employees&nbsp; of the corporation and&nbsp; of the factory from doing their work to the damage and&nbsp; prejudice&nbsp; of the plaintiff.&nbsp; Wherefore, plaintiff prayed that a preliminary writ of injunction&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued pending&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; of the case on the merits and,&nbsp; thereafter, judgment be rendered making the injunction permanent and ordering defendants to pay&nbsp; damages&nbsp; consisting in not&nbsp; less than P40&nbsp; per day representing his unearned profits&nbsp; from August&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1957 until&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have actually&nbsp; ceased&nbsp; doing&nbsp; the unlawful acts complained of Defendants, on&nbsp; August 28, 1957, moved&nbsp; to dismiss the complaint on the ground that its&nbsp; subject-matter does not come within the jurisdiction of the court.&nbsp; They alleged that on&nbsp; April 4, 1957, a&nbsp; prosecutor of the Court of Industrial Relations, acting on a complaint filed by the petitioning union, filed a charge for unfair labor practice against the San Miguel Brewery Box Factory owned and operated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; San Miguel Brewery, Inc., including one Pedro Bautista alleged to be the superintendent of the&nbsp; factory. Respondents therein filed a motion to dismiss contending that while the&nbsp; box factory is owned by said corporation, it is however operated by one Gonzalo Sanchez who acted as an independent contractor in connection&nbsp; with the work performed in said&nbsp; factory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The union denied that Sanchez was&nbsp; operating&nbsp; the factory as an&nbsp; independent contractor.<br><br>While this&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; labor case was then pending&nbsp; before the industrial court, the members of the union were&nbsp; locked out&nbsp; thereby forcing&nbsp; them to picket the premises&nbsp; of the factory.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, an agreement was entered into between the&nbsp; SMB Box Factory represented by Gonzalo Sanchez&nbsp; on one hand, and the union on the other, setting forth the&nbsp; conditions&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; return&nbsp; of the workers.&nbsp; As a result, the&nbsp; workers&nbsp; returned to&nbsp; work, but on August 8, 1957,&nbsp; the members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; union&nbsp; were again locked-out in&nbsp; violation&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; whereupon they&nbsp; again picketed&nbsp; the&nbsp; premises which&nbsp; gave rise to&nbsp; the institution of&nbsp; the action&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages&nbsp; by Gonzalo Sanchez against the union and other laborers who sympathized with them.<br><br>In view of&nbsp; the petition for preliminary injunction&nbsp; contained in the&nbsp; complaint, the court&nbsp; set&nbsp; a date for hearing to give the parties an opportunity to appear and&nbsp; argue their respective points of view,&nbsp; and&nbsp; after the&nbsp; hearing, but without receiving any testimonial evidence, the court granted&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; 'and issued the corresponding writ. To set aside&nbsp; this order on the ground of lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction,&nbsp; defendants have interposed the present petition for certiorari.<br><br>The&nbsp; only issue before us is whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Rizal has jurisdiction to take cognizance of Civil Case No. 4655 instituted by Gonzalo Sanchez against the members of the petitioning union to prevent them from picketing and&nbsp; coinmitting acts of violence in the premises of the&nbsp; factory&nbsp; operated by him, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; the affirmative, if the writ&nbsp; of preliminai'y injunction issued by it to prevent them from doing the&nbsp; aforesaid acts of violence during the pendency of the case was issued in accordance with law.<br><br>It is contended&nbsp; in&nbsp; behalf&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent Gonzalo Sanchez that the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Rizal&nbsp; can take cognizance of the case instituted by him because the same merely aims at preventing the members of the&nbsp; petitioning union&nbsp; from committing&nbsp; acts of&nbsp; violence in&nbsp; the premises of&nbsp; the&nbsp; factory he&nbsp; is operating&nbsp; and at recovering the&nbsp; damages&nbsp; that&nbsp; he may have&nbsp; suffered resulting&nbsp; from said acts&nbsp; of&nbsp; violence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel contends that that&nbsp; case does not&nbsp; concern any labor dispute nor does it involves an unfair labor&nbsp; practice and&nbsp; so&nbsp; it does not done under the jurisdiction of&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations.<br><br>We&nbsp; fail&nbsp; to&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; this&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; While&nbsp; it&nbsp; is true that&nbsp; the case instituted by Gonzalo Sanchez is merely one&nbsp; which concern the&nbsp; picketing&nbsp; or&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of&nbsp; acts of violence by the&nbsp; members of the petitioning union and its purpose is primarily to prevent them from committing said&nbsp; unlawful acts&nbsp; and incidentally to recover whatever damages he may have suffered as an incident thereto, it cannot&nbsp; be denied that&nbsp; before the institution of said&nbsp; case there was&nbsp; already&nbsp; a formal&nbsp; complaint of unfair labor practice filed against the operator of the San Miguel&nbsp; Brewery Box&nbsp; Factory by&nbsp; the&nbsp; members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said union wherein the same issue&nbsp; concerning the&nbsp; labor relation between&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; in said&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; was involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; The claim that Gonzalo Sanchez was not involved in the unfair labor case&nbsp; pending before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations is not quite&nbsp; correct for&nbsp; precisely the respondents therein moved to dismiss the charge contending that the factory was then being&nbsp; operated, not by the San&nbsp; Miguel Brewery,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; but&nbsp; by Gonzalo Sanchez&nbsp; as an independent contractor,&nbsp; which was denied by the union and this placed before&nbsp; the&nbsp; industrial court the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; of&nbsp; whether&nbsp; it&nbsp; is Sanchez or other&nbsp; subordinate&nbsp; employee&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporation the&nbsp; one&nbsp; responsible for&nbsp; the&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; labor&nbsp; practice complained&nbsp; of.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case instituted by Sanchez the same issue was raised by the&nbsp; union and so it can be said&nbsp; that the two cases are&nbsp; directly interwoven.<br><br>On all&nbsp; fours with the present&nbsp; is the case of National Garments&nbsp;&nbsp; and Textiles&nbsp; Workers'&nbsp; Union-Paflu&nbsp; (Premier Shirts&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Pants Factory Chapter)&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; Hermogenes Caluag, et al.,&nbsp; 99 Phil.,&nbsp; 1067<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>,&nbsp; wherein one Vicente&nbsp; Ang filed in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of Rizal against&nbsp; a labor union an action for&nbsp; injunction because of&nbsp; certain acts of violence committed by its members as a result of a labor dispute that arose between them,&nbsp; and because such labor dispute&nbsp; was already involved in&nbsp; two&nbsp; unfair labor cases that were then&nbsp; pending&nbsp; between&nbsp; the same&nbsp; parties before the Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations,&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court held that the case belonged to the exclusive jurisdiction of the latter court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court said: "It appearing&nbsp; that the issue involved in the main case&nbsp; is interwoven with the unfair labor cases pending&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Industrial Relations as to which its jurisdiction is exclusive, it is&nbsp; evident that it does not come under the jurisdiction of the trial court&nbsp; even if it involves&nbsp; sets of violence, intimidation and coercion as averred in the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; These acts come within the purview of Section&nbsp; 9 (d)&nbsp; of Republic Act 875 which may be enjoined&nbsp; by the Court of Industrial Relations."<br><br>Even&nbsp; assuming&nbsp; <i>arguendo</i> that the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rizal could entertain the&nbsp; case&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; by Gonzalo Sanchez against&nbsp; petitioning&nbsp; union, still&nbsp; we declare that the&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction issued&nbsp; by said court cannot have any legal effect&nbsp; because involving as it does&nbsp; a labor dispute between employer and employee, the same can&nbsp; only be&nbsp; issued following the procedure&nbsp; laid down&nbsp; in Section&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; of Republic Act 875.&nbsp; The court <i>a quo</i> failed to do this but&nbsp; merely followed Rule&nbsp; 60, Section 6 of the Rules, of Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said order is therefore null and void.<br><blockquote>"We believe&nbsp; however that in order that an injunction may&nbsp; lie properly issued the procedure laid down in section 9&nbsp; (d) of&nbsp; Republic Act. 875 should be followed and cannot be granted <i>ex-parte</i> as allowed by Rule 60,&nbsp; Section 6, of the Rules of Court&nbsp; The reason is that the case, involving&nbsp; as it does&nbsp; a labor dispute, comes under said section 9 (d) of the law.&nbsp; That procedure&nbsp; requires that there should&nbsp; be a hearing at&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties should be&nbsp; given&nbsp; an opportunity&nbsp; to present witnesses in support of the&nbsp; complaint and of the opposition, if any, with opportunity for cross-examination, and that&nbsp; the other conditions required by said section as prerequisites for the granting of relief must be established and stated in&nbsp; the order of the court.&nbsp; Unless this&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; is followed, the proceedings&nbsp; would be invalid and of no effect.&nbsp; The court would then be acting in excess of its jurisdiction.&nbsp; (Lauf vs. E. G. Shinner &amp; Co., Inc., <i>supra</i>)" (Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions&nbsp; (PAFLU), et al. vs. Hon. Bicnvenido A. Tan, et al, 99 Phil., 854; 52 Off. Gaz. (13)&nbsp; 5836).</blockquote>Wherefore, petition is&nbsp; granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court hereby sets aside&nbsp; the writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction issued by respondent Judge, without pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.<br><br>The writ of preliminary injunction issued by this&nbsp; Court is declared permanent.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Labrador, Concepcion,, Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.
