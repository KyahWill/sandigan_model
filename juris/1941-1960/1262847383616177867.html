				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Respondent Engracio Santos was charged in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Rizal with the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of rape.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trial, said respondent was&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; and&nbsp; sentenced to the maximum period&nbsp; of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, from&nbsp; 17 years, 4 months and 1 day to 20 years, and to pay&nbsp; the costs.&nbsp; Appealing to the Court of Appeals, respondent filed a&nbsp; motion to quash and for&nbsp; discharge,&nbsp; on the ground that the trial court was without jurisdiction, there having been no valid complaint subscribed and sworn to by the offended party as required by Article&nbsp; 344 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Said motion was granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence&nbsp; this appeal by the petitioners.<br><br>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; contended&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; "salaysay"&nbsp; executed&nbsp; and signed by petitioner Policarpia Bansuelo&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 12, 1954, before&nbsp; and in&nbsp; the presence&nbsp; of Fiscal&nbsp; Nicanor&nbsp; P. Nicolas of Rizal and Capt. Hermogenes Marco of the PCAC, is sufficient in form and substance to serve as the complaint required by Article&nbsp; 344 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; That the law&nbsp; requiring that the&nbsp; crime of rape, among others, shall be commenced by&nbsp; a complaint&nbsp; filed by the offended party is merely "designed for the protection of the offended party and her family who may prefer to suffer the outrage in silence rather than&nbsp; go through with the&nbsp; scandal of a public&nbsp; trial"&nbsp; (Samilin&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Pangasinan,&nbsp; 57 Phil.&nbsp; 298,&nbsp; 304) ; that&nbsp; when&nbsp; petitioner Bansuelo executed&nbsp; said "Salaysay",&nbsp; she had manifested her desire to prosecute the maniacal abuse committed against her;&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; "salaysay"&nbsp; has&nbsp; conformed&nbsp; substantially to the&nbsp; requisites of a, valid complaint;&nbsp; that it&nbsp; cannot be considered&nbsp; as her&nbsp; testimony during the&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; investigation because,&nbsp; if&nbsp; it were&nbsp; so,&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; witnesses should&nbsp; have also signed it.<br><br>After&nbsp; a&nbsp; thorough examination&nbsp; of the "salaysay" in question, we agree with the&nbsp; appealed decision that it&nbsp; is a narration of how the crime of rape was committed against petitioner Bansuelo.&nbsp; Aa correctly&nbsp; pointed out by the Solicitor General&nbsp; in&nbsp; his comment on the motion&nbsp; for recon- sideration,&nbsp; such sworn&nbsp; statement&nbsp; "salaysay" is not&nbsp; the complaint contemplated in and required by&nbsp; sections 1, 2 and 5 of Rule 106 of the Rules of Court and Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code."<blockquote>The complaint is&nbsp; the process which begins the criminal&nbsp; action, and no other pleading on the part of the government is necessary. So, if a criminal&nbsp; action, had been commenced by complaint&nbsp; in appropriate cases, it would he error for the court to dismiss&nbsp; it, because&nbsp; it was not&nbsp; presented through the mediation of the prosecution officer."&nbsp; (Moran's&nbsp; Comments on&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of Court,&nbsp; 3d ed. [1950], Vol. II, p. 548).</blockquote>The complaint contemplated by the law&nbsp; and the rules is necessarily that one&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in court.&nbsp; The&nbsp; "salaysay"&nbsp; was filed with the Fiscal and&nbsp; not with the court;&nbsp; it did not start the criminal proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals dwelt&nbsp; lengthily on&nbsp; this point when it said:<br><blockquote>"Counsel for&nbsp; the complainant vigorously states in the motion for reconsideration, as well as in his&nbsp; reply to the comment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Solicitor General, that in the instant ease there has been substantial compliance with the law requiring the filing of a complaint&nbsp; by the offended party&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to confer jurisdiction to the&nbsp; trial court, for&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; alleged,&nbsp; on January 13,&nbsp; 1954, the offended party has subscribed and sworn to before the provincial fiscal a written statement&nbsp; "salaysay"&nbsp; wherein&nbsp;&nbsp; she&nbsp;&nbsp; narrated&nbsp; how&nbsp;&nbsp; she&nbsp; was&nbsp; raped by&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused.<br><br><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>"Section 1 of Rule 106 provides that:<br><br>'All criminal actions&nbsp; must&nbsp; be commenced either by complaint or information in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of the&nbsp; People&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines against all persons "who appear to be responsible therefor.'<br><br>"Section 2&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule 106&nbsp; defines a&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; as a:<br><br>'. . . sworn statement&nbsp; charging a person with an offense,&nbsp; subscribed by the offended party, any peace officer or other employee of the government or governmental institution in&nbsp; charge of&nbsp; the enforcement&nbsp; or execution of the law violated.'<br><br>"And pursuant to Section 5 of&nbsp; Rule 106, a complaint or information is sufficient:<br><br>&nbsp;'. . . if it states the name of the&nbsp; defendant;&nbsp; the designation of the offense by the&nbsp; statute;&nbsp; the&nbsp; acts or omissions&nbsp; complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate time&nbsp; of the commission of the offense;&nbsp; and the place "wherein the offense was committed.'<br><br>"Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code provides that: 'The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts&nbsp; of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor in any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned by the above named persons, as&nbsp; the case may be.'</blockquote>"In front of these provisions of law, it cannot be certainly pretended&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; 'salaysay'&nbsp; or&nbsp; written statement&nbsp; of the offended party, Exhibit&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; could&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; required by&nbsp; law&nbsp; for&nbsp; the proper initiation of&nbsp; the present case&nbsp; of&nbsp; rape.<br><br>"It&nbsp; is argued, however, that said&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; 1 should&nbsp; be considered&nbsp; as the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; required by law,&nbsp; for on&nbsp; the basis thereof the provincial&nbsp; fiscal of Rizal conducted&nbsp; the preliminary investigation&nbsp; and then&nbsp; filed the information at&nbsp; bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; further&nbsp; argued that&nbsp; since&nbsp; under&nbsp; Republic Act No. 732, provincial&nbsp; fiscals have now the same&nbsp; authority&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Peace to&nbsp; conduct preliminary investigation,&nbsp; said Exhibit 1&nbsp; should be considered&nbsp; as the complaint contemplated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; Court&nbsp; and the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot concur&nbsp; to&nbsp; this&nbsp; theory, for according to Section 2 of Republic Act No. 782,&nbsp; after the provincial fiscal has conducted an&nbsp; investigation of a case, he&nbsp; has the duty&nbsp; to&nbsp; have prepared&nbsp; an information or complaint.&nbsp; The pertinent portion of Section 2 of Republic Act No. 782 provides:<br><blockquote>CA provincial fiscal shall have authority&nbsp; to conduct investigation into the matter&nbsp; of any crime or misdemeanor and have the necessary information or complaint prepared or made against persons charged with the commission of the same.'</blockquote>And the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; in this provision of law&nbsp; is precisely&nbsp; what is denned and mentioned' in the Rules of Court and the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Accordingly, we hold the view&nbsp; that in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar,&nbsp; after the fiscal has investigated the case, he should&nbsp; have procured the filing of a.&nbsp; complaint by the offended party to properly initiate this case and&nbsp; not file by himself an&nbsp; information as&nbsp; he did."<br><br>It&nbsp; is also argued that&nbsp; in affixing&nbsp; her signature and swearing to the allegations of&nbsp; the&nbsp; information together with the fiscal, petitioner Bansuelo had complied with the requirement of a valid complaint.&nbsp; Respondent Santos has answered this argument by saying that such&nbsp; fact is not borne out by the records; that such&nbsp; assertion&nbsp; has never been made before the Court of&nbsp; Appeals; that, the opening paragraph of the&nbsp; information&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; and unmistakably shows that the&nbsp; fiscal&nbsp; alone accuses respondent Santos of the crime of rape; that&nbsp; the offended party has never been referred to in the body of the&nbsp; information as having requested its filing.<br><br>We&nbsp; cannot consider&nbsp; the information,&nbsp; although signed by petitioner Bansuelo together with the fiscal, as equivalent&nbsp; to the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; required&nbsp; by law,&nbsp; because&nbsp; said information lacks the oath of the&nbsp; complainant; the what contained therein is the&nbsp; subscribed and sworn certification of the&nbsp; fiscal that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; conducted the&nbsp; preliminary investigation&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; obviously the&nbsp; offended&nbsp; party had taken no participation "whatsoever;&nbsp; in very&nbsp; unequivocal terms, the&nbsp; information commences&nbsp; with&nbsp; the statement that "the undersigned fiscal accuse Engracio Santos of the crime of rape", the offended party not&nbsp; having been mentioned at all as one of the accusers.<br><br>It is&nbsp; not&nbsp; altogether&nbsp; true&nbsp; that to&nbsp; require the&nbsp; offended party to draft the complaint in legal form and terminology, —otherwise the complaint&nbsp; will be insufficient,—would impose a penalty on&nbsp; ignorance, and that a person with no legal-training will not be able to institute a criminal action for&nbsp; private crimes;&nbsp; because, as may be gathered from the provisions of Section 2&nbsp; of Republic Act 732, it is the duty of the Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal to prepare the necessary complaint after&nbsp; having taken down&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; of the offended&nbsp; party&nbsp; and&nbsp; his witnesses&nbsp; during the preliminary investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; law required this, since the victims of crimes which cannot be prosecuted except upon their complaint may be ignorant of&nbsp; the law,&nbsp; to&nbsp; say the least.<br><br>This Court has invariably&nbsp; maintained strict compliance with the&nbsp; jurisdictional&nbsp; requirement of a complaint by the offended&nbsp; party,&nbsp; as defined&nbsp; in Section 2 of&nbsp; Rule 106 and Article 344&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of People vs. Palabao (L-8027, August 31, 1954), we considered&nbsp; insufficient an&nbsp; information filed with the Provincial Fiscal, wherein&nbsp; the offended party signed at the bottom thereof and above the signature of the prosecuting officer, the information even&nbsp; reciting that the Provincial Fiscal charged defendant with the crime of seduction at the "instance of the offended&nbsp; party."&nbsp; In the case of People vs. Martinez, (76 Phil. 559), this Court <i>motu proprio</i> dismissed the&nbsp; case&nbsp; for failure of the&nbsp; aggrieved party&nbsp; to&nbsp; file the proper complaint&nbsp; for the offense of&nbsp; oral defamation, although the accused&nbsp; never raised&nbsp; the question&nbsp; on appeal, thereby showing the necessity of&nbsp; strict compliance with the legal&nbsp; requirement even&nbsp; at the&nbsp; cost&nbsp; of&nbsp; nullifying all the proceedings&nbsp; already&nbsp; had in the lower court.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed. So&nbsp; ordered, without costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception,</i> and <i>Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L., JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
