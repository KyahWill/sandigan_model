				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. ANASTACIO FIGUEROA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LAUREL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal interposed by the City Fiscal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila declaring the herein defendant-appellee, Anastacio  Figueroa, in double jeopardy and forthwith  dismissing the  information  filed against him for homicide.<br><br>It appears that on June  11, 1940, the accused, Anastacio Figueroa, stabbed one Melchor Aguilar with a knife, causing upon the latter several wounds on a vital part of the body (the chest).  Figueroa was thereupon prosecuted for the crime of frustrated homicide in the Court of First Instance of Manila, and upon plea of guilty, was on June 20, 1940, sentenced to an  indeterminate penalty of  from  2 years, 4 months, and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>to 6 years and 1 day  of  <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>.   Several days later, however, the victim, Melchor Aguilar,  succumbed to his injuries and for that reason the accused was on June 29,  1940, prosecuted anew for the  crime of  homicide. He pleaded not guilty to the charge and then filed a motion to quash the proceedings on the ground of former  conviction or former jeopardy. The trial judge upon  consideration of the  facts  and the merits of the  case, declared the accused in double jeopardy and forthwith dismissed the information.  To this judgment the City Fiscal excepted and brought the case to this Court for a definitive ruling on the legal question involved.<br><br>The  only question presented for adjudication is whether an accused who had previously been convicted of frustrated homicide may subsequently be prosecuted for the consummated  offense if death supervenes after conviction on the lesser charge.<br><br>We are in accord with the appellant's contention that the protection against a second jeopardy is only for  the same offense, not for the same act.  But the question is:  When are two offenses considered the same ?  In the case  of People vs. Tarok, G. R. No. 47453,  promulgated by this  Court on October 9, 1941  (40 Off. Gaz., 3488), we pointed out that in view of the innovation introduced by section 9, Rule 113 of our  Rules, the rule now obtaining in this jurisdiction is that  an offense shall be considered the same  as  the other not only when one is identical to the other but also  when one necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the  offense charged in  the  former  complaint or  information. There we said:<br><br><blockquote>".  .   .  The rules of Court recently promulgated by this Court and which took  effect on  July  1, 1940, prescribe in section 9, Rule 113, thereof as follows:<br><br>" 'Sec. 9.<span style="font-style: italic;">  Former conviction or acquittal or former jeopardy</span>.—When a defendant shall have been convicted or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the defendant,  by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a  valid complaint or information or other formal charge sufficient in  form and substance to sustain a  conviction, and after the defendant had pleaded to the  charge, the conviction or acquittal of the defendant or  the  dismissal  of  the case  shall  be a  bar to another prosecution for the offense  charged, or for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which  necessarily includes or is necessarily  included  in the offense charged in the  former complaint or information.<br></blockquote><br>That is to say, under the New Rules, one offense shall be fir considered the same as the other not only when one is identical to the other but also when one necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the other.  This section 9, Rule 113, is in lieu of sections 26, 27 and 28 of General Orders No. 58.  It will  be noted that this section 9 is a composite of sections 26 and 28 of  General Orders No. 58, with some modifications. It will also be noted that section 27 of General Orders No. 58 has been eliminated.<br><br><blockquote>"Section 26 of General Orders No/58 was the main law on  jeopardy prior to  the promulgation  of  the Rules of Court.  Section 27 merely  provides for  an exception to the general rule expressed in section 26 and contemplates a situation where jeopardy does not attach.  Section 28 is but another defense available to the defendant similar to jeopardy.<br><br>"Under the New Rules, the pleas available to a defendant under sections 26 and 28 of General Orders No. 58 are all considered as pleas of former jeopardy or former conviction or acquittal.  The important change, however, lies in the wording of the last part of the New Rules (sec. 9, Rule 113) which was taken from  section 26, General Orders No. 58.  The original provision  of section 26, General Orders No. 58, states:  'the conviction, acquittal, or jeopardy shall be a bar to another information or indictment for the offense charged, or for an attempt to commit the same, or for a frustration thereof, <span style="font-style: italic;">or for any offense necessarily therein included</span> of which he  might have been convicted under such complaint or information.'<br><br>"To our mind, the principle embodied in the New Rules of Court is a  clear  expression of selection of rule amidst  conflicting theories.  We take  the position  that when we amended section 26 of General Orders No. 58 by providing that the conviction or acquittal of the defendant or the dismissal of the case shall be a bar to another prosecution for any offense not only necessarily therein included but which necessarily includes the offense charged in the former complaint or  information, we meant what we  have,  in plain language, stated. We certainly did not mean to engage in the simple play of words. .  .  .  "<br><br>We observed in that case that "An attempted or frustrated crime is included in the consummated.  Both under the General Orders No. 58 and  the New Rules of Court, a person convicted of a consummated offense may  not be, for the same act, prosecuted for any attempt or frustration thereof.  If, after trial and conviction for an attempted or frustrated offense, there should supervene a consummated offense,  we express the opinion that conviction or acquittal of the lesser offense is a bar to subsequent prosecution for the consummated offense. .  .  ."<br></blockquote><br>The judgment of the trial court herein appealed from, is therefore affirmed, and the information for  homicide filed against  the defendant-appellee, Anastacio Figueroa, hereby dismissed, with costs de oficio.  So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, Pres., Abad Santos</span>, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Horrilleno, JJ</span>.,  concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diaz, </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">J</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.,</span> dissenting:<br><br>Upon the same ground expressed in my dissenting opinion in People vs. Tarok, 40 Off. Gaz., No. 17, page 3488, I dissent from the opinion of the majority that holds that there is a former jeopardy in the present case.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Moran, </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">M</span>., disidente:<br><br>Reproduzco aqui mi disidencia formulada y razonada en el asunto de Pueblo contra Tarok, R.
