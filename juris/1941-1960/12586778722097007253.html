				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 12, 1929,&nbsp; Patricio Basto, now deceased, registered owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; an undivided one-half portion of the land described&nbsp; in&nbsp; Original Certificate of Title No. 25620, sold said property to the&nbsp; spouses of&nbsp; Emerenciana Quinit and Teodoro Gundran for the sum of P280&nbsp; redeemable within ten years&nbsp; (Exh. "A").&nbsp;&nbsp; The redemption&nbsp; period&nbsp; expired without Basto exercising his right of repurchase. <br><br>Sometime in July, 1948, plaintiffs Florida Lagmay and Esteban Madruño filed the present&nbsp; action (Civil Case No. 10330)&nbsp; against&nbsp; defendant Emerenciana&nbsp; Quinit&nbsp; (since widowed)&nbsp; and her children, claiming that they had bought from&nbsp; Quinit&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1943, for&nbsp; the amount of P450,&nbsp; the same land that&nbsp; Quinit and her deceased husband&nbsp; had&nbsp; acquired from&nbsp; Patricio Basto&nbsp; under the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; Exh.&nbsp; "A",&nbsp; as evidenced by the writing in the Ilocano dialect appearing at the back of&nbsp; the last page of Exh.&nbsp; "A",&nbsp; and&nbsp; praying that Quinit be ordered to execute the formal deed of sale as well as to deliver possession&nbsp; of the land in&nbsp; question to them. <br><br>After trial, the court below found that the writing&nbsp; at the back of the&nbsp; last page of Exh. "A" was a subrogation of the rights&nbsp; of the vendor <span style="font-style: italic;">a retro </span>Patricio Basto in favor of the plaintiffs spouses; that&nbsp; before the&nbsp; filing of the present case,&nbsp; Civil Case No. 9859 was filed by one Floserfida Basto (relative of Patricio&nbsp; Basto) against appellee Emerenciana&nbsp; Quinit,&nbsp; claiming ownership of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in question as successor&nbsp; of Patricio&nbsp; Basto&nbsp; by virtue of a repurchase allegedly made by her relative Florida Lagmay and Esteban Madruno (herein plaintiffs-appellants) during the Japanese occupation by virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; writing at the back of Exh.&nbsp; "A"; that said Case No. 9859 was, however, amicably settled, with Basto receiving P350 from&nbsp; defendant Quinit and&nbsp; herein&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; Lagmay and&nbsp; Madruño the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; P450, in&nbsp; consideration for which both Basto and plaintiffs waived, in favor of Quinit,&nbsp; whatever rights&nbsp; they had acquired under the writing at&nbsp; the back of Exh. "A";&nbsp; and rendered judgment holding that plaintiffs have&nbsp; no&nbsp; more right to the&nbsp; property in&nbsp; question and dismissing their complaint. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>From the judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court, plaintiffs&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; directly to this Court, assigning as sole error that the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; erred in interpreting the writing in&nbsp; the Ilocano dialect at the back of Exh. "A" as a subrogation in their favor of the interests of Patricio&nbsp; Basto in&nbsp; the deed of sale <span style="font-style: italic;">con pacto de retro</span> Exh. "A", instead of interpreting it as&nbsp; an absolute sale of&nbsp; the&nbsp; land in question by defendant-appellee&nbsp; Quinit to them. <br><br>We find no merit in the&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; In the first place,&nbsp; the writing in question is in the Ilocano dialect and no translation thereof appears to have been presented in evidence. Admission of this writing was objected to by defendants on the&nbsp; ground that it&nbsp; was not in an official language, and the same&nbsp; was admitted conditionally,&nbsp; subject to plaintiffs' presenting&nbsp; official translation&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; (t.s.n.&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 12-13), which they never did.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, said writing is&nbsp; not admissible in evidence (Sec. 57, Rule 123, Rules of Court). <br><br>In the second place, by limiting their appeal to the legal question of the correct interpretation of the&nbsp; writing in the&nbsp; Ilocano dialect at the back&nbsp; of Exh.&nbsp; "A", appellants are&nbsp; deemed to&nbsp; have&nbsp; admitted the trial&nbsp; court's findings that whatever rights they had acquired under said&nbsp; writing had&nbsp; been&nbsp; bought back from them by&nbsp; appellee Quinit for the sum of P450 incident to the settlement of the former case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 9859 and that therefore, they have no&nbsp; more rights to the land in question. In view thereof, the question of the true nature and import of the contract noted in Exh. "A"&nbsp; has become moot and academic. The judgment appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is,&nbsp; therefore, affirmed, with costs against appellants Florida Lagmay and Esteban Madruño.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,&nbsp;</span> concur. <br><br><br></div>
