				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The facts of this case are  not in controversy and  are correctly  narrated  in  the brief of the State.   They  are as follows: <br><br>Ong  Tin is  undisputedly an alien, he being  a subject of the Republic of China (Exhs. A,  B and  C).   On May 27,  1954,  he  applied  with the  Office of the Mayor  of Quezon City for a  permit and license to open  and operate a  "sari-sari" store to be  located at  the  corner of K-D and  K-3rd, Kamuning, Quezon City, which application was approved  on  the  same  date with  the  issuance  to him  of  <span style="font-style: italic;">Permit No. 4360</span>  (Exhibits D and E).  On August 8,  1954,  Pedro  S.  Bolano, Chief  of the Licenses-Taxes Division,  Office of  the City Treasurer, Quezon City, went to the  said store  and  informed Ong Tin that  pursuant to the memorandum order of the Mayor of Quezon City, he was required to surrender the <span style="font-style: italic;">permit</span> that was previously issued to him.   Appellant  replied that he could not surrender  the permit for the reason  that the  question  of the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 1180 was pending resolution by  the  Supreme Court.            <br><br>Pursuant to the subpoena issued by the First Assistant City  Attorney of Quezon  City directed to  Ong  Tin (Exhibit Y), the  latter appeared before said  official  who then required of him to surrender his license and warned him not to continue engaging in his  retail business as  otherwise he would  be  prosecuted  for  violation of  the law.   Ong Tin  asked for a week time to decide whether or not to surrender  his license after which he informed the  City Attorney that he was not  willing to surrender said license and that he was ready to fight the case in  court.   On October 12, 1954,  Bolano, accompanied by Patrolman  Leonardo San  Jose,  again  repaired to  the  premises of  Ong  Tin and saw that  the "sari-sari" store was still operating and continues to operate up to the present time. <br><br>Because of the  foregoing  facts  that  appeared at  the investigation  conducted  by the authorities, Ong Tin  was charged in the Court of First Instance of  Rizal  (Quezon City Branch)  with violation  of Section  1, in  relation to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 1180,  entitled "An Act to Regulate the  Retail Business", and after  proper proceedings  and hearing the Court found said  defendant  guilty as charged in the information and sentenced him to  suffer: "the penalty of three  (3) years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> and a  fine of  P3.000 and upon defendant's  failure to  pay the same, for  him  to suffer the corresponding subsidiary imprisonment  which shall  not  exceed  1/3  of the  principal penalty; and  to pay the costs.  After the  service of the sentence,  defendant  is  hereby ordered  deported to  the country of his origin." <br><br>From this decision Ong  Tin appealed to this Court, his counsel contending in this instance that the lower  Court erred:<br><ol><li>In  convicting  the accused without  passing upon  the  constitutionality of Republic Act  1180-an  issue  squarely  raised by the accused as  a defense during the trial of this case;<br><br> </li><li>n  not finding that Republic Act 1180 is unconstitutional  and, therefore, null and  void;  <br><br></li><li>In  convicting the  abused  because  Republic Act  1180,  as applied  to  him, is  unconstitutional  and  docs  not  warrant  his conviction;<br><br> </li><li>In not holding  that even assuming Republic  Act 3] 80  to  be constitutional, the same does not  apply to  the accused inasmuch as  lie obtained his  permit  and license to  engage in the  retail trade  before  the  said  law  was  approved  and before it  became effective;  and<br><br> </li><li>In failing to  take into  account the  confusion which reigned  in the mind of  the accused as  a consequence of divergent views held by  the  City  Mayor  and  the City  Attorney  regarding his  continuance in the retail business  and thus  erred  in  finding  the accused  guilty  beyond reasonable  doubt of  the violation  of the provisions of Republic Act 1180.</li></ol>As may  be  seen  the  first three assignments of error deal  with the constitutionality of  the  aforementioned Republic Act  1180,  a  point which was  already  decided by Us in the noted case of Lao H. Ichong vs. Jaime Hernandez et  al.,  (101  Phil,  1155)  penned by  Mr.  Justice  Alejo Labrador and   promulgated   on  May  31,  1957,  In  this decision we said:<br><blockquote>"Resuming  what we  have set forth above  we  hold that the disputed law  (Rep. Act No. 1180) was enacted to remedy a real actual threat  and danger  to national economy  posed  by  alien dominance and  control  of  the  retail  business  and  free  citizens and country  from such dominance and control;  that  the enactment  clearly  falls within  the scope of the police power of the State, thru which and by  which it  protects  its own  personality and insures its security  and future;  that  the law  does  not violate the equal  protection  clause  of  the  Constitution because sufficient grounds  exist  for the  distinction between  alien   and  citizen  in the exercise  of the  occupation  regulated,  nor the  due  process  of law clause, because the law  is prospective in operation  and recognizes  the privilege of  aliens already  engaged  in  the occupation and reasonably protects  their  privilege; that the  wisdom  and efficacy of  the law  to  carry out  its  objectives appear to us  to be  plainly evident—as  a matter of fact it  seems not anly appropriate but  actually  necessary—and that  in  any case  such matter falls within the prerogative of the Legislature, with whose power and discretion the Judicial  department of the  Government may  not  interfere;  that the  provisions of  the law  are  clearly embraced in the title, and this suffers from no duplicity and  has not  misled  the legislators or the  segment of the population  affected; and that  it cannot be said to be void  for  supposed conflict  with treaty  obligations  because no  treaty has actually been entered  into on  the subject  and  tile police power  may not be curtailed or surrendered by any treaty or any other conventional agreement." </blockquote>It  is claimed, however, that in  the  decision  appealed from the trial court failed to pass upon the constitutionality of Republic Act No.  1180,  an issue squaraly raised  by the  accused as  a  defense during the trial  of the  case. We  consider, however, that this alleged error is of  no moment, because laws passed  by Congress  are presumed to be constitutional  until they  are  otherwise declared  by final decision of this Court. <br><br>The next issue raised by defense  counsel  refers to the proposition that even assuming  that  Republic  Act No. 1180 is constitutional, yet the  same does not apply to the accused  inasmuch as he  has  obtained  his  permit and license to engage in  the retail trade <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> said  law was approved  and  <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span>  it  became effective.   We  find  no merit in this  contention because the acts  constituting the crime for which appellant has been convicted in  the case at bar were all executed <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> the effectivity of  Republic Act  No. 1180, and by no  means  can We consider appellant's conviction as  the result  of the application to him of an <span style="font-style: italic;">ex post facto</span> law.  In this connection defense counsel further argues  that  appellant  can not be convicted  of a violation of Republic Act  No.  1180 since he had  secured a license to operate a <span style="font-style: italic;">sari-sari</span> store prior to the date when said  law  became effective on  June  19,  1954.  Said  in other words,  counsel contends  that the license  can not be taken away  from  him  and  much less  can he be held criminally  liable of making use of said license.  But,  as pointed out by  the Solicitor  General, it has  already  been held that the granting of license does  not create  irrevocable rights,  neither is it  property or  property rights (Pedro vs. Provincial Board of Rizal, 56 Phil., 123; Vinco vs.  Municipality of  Hinigaran, 44 Phil.,  790;  Joaquin vs. Herrera, 37 Phil., 705; 12 C.  J. 958, Section 494; 37 C. J. 168).  Moreover,  as appellant himself  admitted in  the instant case that he continued to operate his sari-sari store even after the passage of Republic Act No. 1180,  and that up to the present he continues to  operate the same, it  can not be denied that he has incurred the liability prescribed by  law, because under its provisions  his continued  operation of the store was in violation of the context thereof. <br><br>Going now over the  penalty of  incarceration imposed upon appellant by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, We notice that the convict was  sentenced to three  (3)  years  of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correctional</span>,  a punishment which  does  not come within  the classification of imprisonment penalties provided by special penal laws,  but of the Revised Penal  Code.  The Solicitor General also points  out that  the provisions  of  the  Indeterminate Sentence Act have  not been applied in  his case. <br><br>Wherefore, and in so far  as the penalty  of  imprisonment is concerned, the decision appealed from shall be, as it is hereby modified by sentencing appellant to an indeterminate penalty of from three  (3)  years to three  (3) years and three (3)  months of imprisonment.   With the modifications just stated, the decision  appealed from  is hereby affirmed in all other respects,  with costs against appellant. So  ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Reyes A., Bautista Angelo,  Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
