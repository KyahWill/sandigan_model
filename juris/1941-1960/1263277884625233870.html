				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Gipriano Laniiza,&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of an&nbsp; ice cream&nbsp; business in the city of&nbsp; Davao&nbsp; with&nbsp; an&nbsp; ice-making machine&nbsp; of Ms own, lias&nbsp; applied for a certificate of public convenience to operate a one-ton ice plant&nbsp; in said city.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; application was opposed by Lat &amp; Beltran, operator&nbsp; of an ice plant service&nbsp; in the&nbsp; same city, on the grounds that the&nbsp; oppositor's service was adequate&nbsp; and&nbsp; sufficient to&nbsp; fill the public need and that&nbsp; to allow&nbsp; another&nbsp; plant to&nbsp; operate would only&nbsp; result in&nbsp; ruinous and&nbsp; wasteful&nbsp; competition.&nbsp; And the&nbsp; Commission having,&nbsp; after hearing, denied the application&nbsp; on the&nbsp; grounds&nbsp; that&nbsp; public convenience did&nbsp; net require&nbsp; the&nbsp; operation of another ice plant&nbsp; because the one operated by oppositor&nbsp; was&nbsp; already rendering an&nbsp; adequate&nbsp; and sufficient service,&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; was&nbsp; brought here&nbsp; lor review.<br><br>The question for determination is whether, on the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; presented, the Commission&nbsp; was&nbsp; sufficiently justified in concluding that public convenience&nbsp; did&nbsp; not require the operation&nbsp; of another ice&nbsp; plant in the&nbsp; city of Davao.<br><br>The decision&nbsp; below gives&nbsp; the following&nbsp; analysis&nbsp; of the evidence.<br><blockquote>"Applicant's evidence consists oi! his&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; and that of three other witnesses&nbsp; named&nbsp; Dominador Dima-ano, Vicente&nbsp; Yngayo&nbsp; and Avelina Garm and their testimony&nbsp; is to the effect that&nbsp; the ice service in Davao City is inadequate! due to the failure of the authorized operator&nbsp; to properly distribute its ice and the fact that&nbsp; ice is&nbsp; not available either&nbsp; at the plant or&nbsp; from delivery trucks on many occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp; These witnesses&nbsp; while&nbsp; admitting that&nbsp; the oppositor&nbsp; has trucks&nbsp; used for delivering ice, frequently these&nbsp; trucks do not go by ihc&nbsp; streets where witnesses leside so that they&nbsp; are not able&nbsp; to buy ice when&nbsp; they need it.&nbsp; Applicant&nbsp; testified that he bought ice-making' machine for the purposes of his ice cream business and&nbsp; that he can&nbsp; produce one ton of&nbsp; ice daily which he desires to sell to&nbsp; the public.&nbsp; Evidence of the oppositor purports to establish the authorized capacity&nbsp; and production of its&nbsp; ice plant in Davao&nbsp; City; the actual demand for ice in Davao City, and the fact that its&nbsp; present production is&nbsp; much more than what the public needs.<br><br>"We&nbsp; have gone&nbsp; over the evidence&nbsp; carefully and we&nbsp; can&nbsp; not say that&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicant has established&nbsp; that there is a public need&nbsp; for the propoaod service.&nbsp; Applicant admitted that he made no observations of the actual demands&nbsp; for ice in Davao and&nbsp; that his prinr cipal complaint ia that it is not possible to&nbsp; buy&nbsp; ice worth five or ten centavos from the oppositor's plant&nbsp; and even&nbsp; this&nbsp; complaint, according&nbsp; to him, was voiced to him by other persons.&nbsp; He said that he produces his own ice for his&nbsp; ice cream business and that he has excess ice&nbsp; to sell to the&nbsp; public.&nbsp; Witness&nbsp; Dima-ano&nbsp; also testified that he has ice-making machine also for&nbsp; his&nbsp; ice cream business but that when he&nbsp; runs out of&nbsp; ice,&nbsp; he&nbsp; goes&nbsp; to&nbsp; the plant of the oppositor and while at&nbsp; times he can&nbsp; buy ice&nbsp; at this plant,&nbsp; on other occasions&nbsp; ice can not&nbsp; be delivered to&nbsp; him.&nbsp; He also admitted that delivery trucks of&nbsp; the oppositor&nbsp; go&nbsp; around Davao&nbsp; City&nbsp; but at&nbsp; times these&nbsp; trucks&nbsp; do not&nbsp; pass by&nbsp; the street&nbsp; where&nbsp; he lives. We doubt&nbsp; the testimony of this&nbsp; witness that he has&nbsp; tried to buy ice from the oppositor's plant and&nbsp; could&nbsp; not get it,&nbsp; first&nbsp; because he&nbsp; has&nbsp; his own ice-making: machine,&nbsp; and&nbsp; secondly&nbsp; there&nbsp; are contradictions in his&nbsp; testimony particularly&nbsp; as the number of&nbsp; times which lie claims he went to the&nbsp; plant of&nbsp; the oppositor.&nbsp; In&nbsp; direct he&nbsp; said that he&nbsp; has&nbsp; gone&nbsp; to&nbsp; the plant&nbsp; about&nbsp; ten times&nbsp; and&nbsp; on cross lie stated that it must have been about fifty times that&nbsp; he was able to get&nbsp; ice from the plant.&nbsp; Witness Yngayo admitted that when he noeds&nbsp; ice for his soft-drinks&nbsp; store, he can buy it either from the delivery truck of the&nbsp; opposito or from, the tatter's plant.&nbsp; As&nbsp; to witness Carin, her complaint is also that the truck of the oppositor does&nbsp; not pass&nbsp; by&nbsp; her&nbsp; street and that the plant of the oppositor is&nbsp; too&nbsp; distant for those who&nbsp; want&nbsp; to buy ice in&nbsp; small quantities.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp; the evidence of the oppositor is that it has two ice plants in Davao City, one in&nbsp; Sta. Ana&nbsp; of 12 tons and another&nbsp; in Bolton&nbsp; Street of 10 tons.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also&nbsp; has&nbsp; a 2% ton plant in&nbsp; Digos and a 2-ton plant in Magupo; that these&nbsp; plants are&nbsp; operated continuously except on&nbsp; days&nbsp; When the brine tanks are full of ice&nbsp; and&nbsp; the entire&nbsp; authorized production is&nbsp; available;&nbsp; that&nbsp; it also has ice&nbsp; storage&nbsp; rooms&nbsp; where&nbsp; it&nbsp; keeps ice that&nbsp; is&nbsp; not sold; that aside from&nbsp; its delivery trucks it also sells ice from its Bolton plant and has&nbsp; a&nbsp; place for&nbsp; dispensing ice at Sta. Ana where&nbsp; a man&nbsp; is&nbsp; always&nbsp; on duty&nbsp; to sell&nbsp; ice&nbsp; to&nbsp; customers, and&nbsp; that there has&nbsp; been no&nbsp; occasion where&nbsp; the&nbsp; production of&nbsp; its plants&nbsp; was exhausted m one&nbsp; day&nbsp; so that&nbsp; there was no&nbsp; ice available for&nbsp; distribution.&nbsp; The evidence&nbsp; also shows that oppasitor was the original ice plant operator in Davao and has on two occasions been authorized to increase the capacity&nbsp; of its plants so as to meet the&nbsp; demands of&nbsp; the public".</blockquote>The decision then&nbsp; concludes:<br><blockquote>'"We are convinced from the evidence that public convenience does not&nbsp; require the operation of the plant proposed&nbsp; by the applicant; that the&nbsp; 22 tons of ioe which oppositor produces daily in Davao and more than adequate for the needs&nbsp; of the public; that oppositor rendors a sufficient and adequate ice distribution service in Davao, and that the authorization of another plant "would only result in wasteful competition, for which reason the opposition to the&nbsp; application is sustained and it is ordered that the application filed&nbsp; therein be, as it is hereby denied."</blockquote>The petitioner for review has submitted no brief.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it&nbsp; is argued&nbsp; in the&nbsp; petition for review that&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; basis of one&nbsp; kilo of ice&nbsp; a day&nbsp; for&nbsp; each inhabitant&nbsp; of Davao City&nbsp; the&nbsp; 22&nbsp; tons&nbsp; of ice&nbsp; produced daily by oppositor's plant can only&nbsp; serve 22,000 of the 120,000&nbsp; people living in Davao City.&nbsp; But the argument is based on the gratuitous&nbsp; assumption&nbsp; that every&nbsp; man, woman&nbsp; and child in that city would be buying&nbsp; one kilo of ice a&nbsp; day.&nbsp; On the other hand, it appears from the deposition of&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; M. Lat that even during the&nbsp; dry" season hardly one-half of the ice manufactured&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; oppositor&nbsp; can&nbsp; be sold, so that a good portion thereof&nbsp; is lost through melting.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; conflict of proff as to the availability of oppositor's ice to people living in&nbsp; remote places or on streets&nbsp; where, so it&nbsp; is&nbsp; alleged, the oppositcr's&nbsp; delivery trucks do not&nbsp; go. But&nbsp; there is&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; reasonably to support the finding of the Commission&nbsp; that the oppositor has four&nbsp; ice plants located in different places&nbsp; and that, aside from delivery trucks,&nbsp; it also has a place for selling its ice.&nbsp; We find no justification for going against this finding.&nbsp;&nbsp; As repeatedly held by this Court; the findings of fact of the Commission, when reasonably supported by the evidence, are conclusive upon this Court (Raymundo Transportation Co. vs. Cervo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> G. R. L-3899, May 21, 1952;&nbsp; Angat-Manila Trans. Co., Inc. vs. Tengco,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> G. E. L-5906, May 26, X954;&nbsp; Estate of Florondo Buan vs. Pampanga Bus Co. &amp; La Mallorca,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup>&nbsp; G. R. L-7996, May 31, 1956), and that this Court "cannot weigh the conflicting evidence and substitute its own conclusion in lieu of those made by the Commission&nbsp; and cannot modify or&nbsp; set aside the&nbsp;&nbsp; latter&nbsp; except when&nbsp; it clearly appears&nbsp; that there&nbsp; was no competent&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; before it to support reasonably its decision. * * *."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ice and Cold Storage of the Phil. Inc. vs. Valero, 85 Phil., 7).<br><br>The claim that the oppositor is charging discriminatory rates and is not&nbsp; selling&nbsp; 5 or 10&nbsp; centavos worth of&nbsp; ice may be a proper subject for complaint with a view to the imposition of corrective measures, but it is hardly a ground for authorizing a&nbsp; new service where the evidence is clear that the ice produced by the present operator is more than enough to take care of the public need.<br><br>Lastly, our attention is called to the fact&nbsp; that the operation already authorized by the Commission is in the name of Pedro M.&nbsp; Lat and Luciano&nbsp; Beltran&nbsp; and not in that of Lat &amp; Beltran,&nbsp; which is alleged to&nbsp; be a partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Commission which is supposed to&nbsp; know its own&nbsp; records&nbsp; and may&nbsp; take judicial cognizance&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp; appears to have recognized the operation of the authorized service by Lat &amp; Beltran,&nbsp; and the objection is really of no moment for,&nbsp; regardless&nbsp; of whether the operator authorized is the partnership&nbsp; itself&nbsp; or its members as individuals, the fact remains&nbsp; that there&nbsp; is already an&nbsp; existing service which the Commission has found to be amply sufficient, so that it can not be said&nbsp; that public convenience still requires the establishment&nbsp; of another ice plant.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the decision of the Commission is affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
