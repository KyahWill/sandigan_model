<p>The accused  pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>After trial,  he was  convicted  and sentenced to  suffer 1 month and 1 day of <em>arresto mayor,</em> and to pay the costs, plus 10 years  and 1 day of <em>prision mayor</em> for  habitual delinquency.</p>
<p>He appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila, where he waived his right to the assistance  of  counsel.</p>
<p>Upon being arraigned,  he pleaded not  guilty, but when the case was  called for hearing,  he  asked permission to withdraw his plea of not  guilty and  substitute it  with that of guilty.  After  the permission  was  granted,  he pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>The court then imposed upon him the  principal penalty of 6  months  and  1 day of  <em>prision correctional</em> and to pay the costs, and  for habitual delinquency, an additional penalty of 30 days of <em>reclusion temporal.</em></p>
<p>The defendant appealed to this Court,  assigning  as erroneous the penalty imposed.</p>
<p>The principal  penalty  imposed is  not correct, for the value of the article stolen is  over P5 but does not exceed P50, and,  consequently,  falls under paragraph 5 of Article 309 of the Revised Penal Code, which fixes the penalty of <em>arresto mayor</em> to its full extent.</p>
<p>The plea of guilty should  not  be  considered  as  a mitigating circumstance,  because  to  be  so  considered,  it should have  been made prior to  the  presentation of the evidence for the prosecution. There is the aggravating circumstance of  recidivism  which should  be considered separately from that of habitual  delinquency.  (People <em>vs.</em> Melendrez, et  al.,  59  Phil.,  154; People <em>vs.</em>  Espina,  62 Phil.,  607).  It  is in  the imposition of  the  additional penalty that recidivism should not be  considered  as  an aggravating circumstance.  (People <em>vs.</em> De Jesus,  63 Phil., 760).  The principal penalty  should,  therefore, be <em>arresto mayor</em> in its  maximum degree, which is from 4 months and  1 day to  6  months.   The penalty  of  6 months and 1 day of prision correctional imposed by the lower court Is 1 day in excess of that  which should have been imposed. We,  therefore, correct the principal penalty by imposing 6 months  of <em>arresto mayor.</em></p>
<p>With regard  to the  additional penalty  for habitual delinquency, we quote with approval  what assistant Solicitor General Jose G. Bautista says in the Government's Brief:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We  are also in accord with the defense  that the  additional penalty of 30 years of reclusion temporal is  not only excessive but is even beyond the range of this penalty  as  reclusion  temporal ranges only from  12 years and 1 day to 20 years of imprisonment. Moreover,  in  determining the  number  of  convictions  for the imposition of the additional penalty, the trial court failed to  take into account  the  rule that  the last  conviction  must precede the offense  for which the accused  is  tried. In  other words, when a habitual criminal  has  committed  several  crimes  without being first convicted of any of them before committing the  others he cannot  be' sentenced  for  each  of  said crimes  to the  gradually increasing  penalty, and  for the  purposes of said law  said  crimes must be  considered  as  one  applying  the  additional  penalty to one  of them,  and  ignoring  the  last  (Gf.  People <em>vs.</em>  Santiago, 55  Phil. 266;  People  <em>vs.</em>  Bernal,  63 Phil.,  750; People  <em>vs.</em>  Caw Liong  and  Yu  Siong, 57 Phil.,  839;  People <em>vs.</em>  Lopido, 38  Off. Gaz., p. 1907; People  <em>vs.</em> De Jesus, 68 Phil., 517; People <em>vs.</em> Albuquerque, 69 Phil., 698).</p>
  <p>"Examining now  the  information in  question  and applying the rule above  adverted  to, the  first  two  convictions on  September 5, 1947, should be  considered as  one because  the second offense was committed  two days after the commission of the  first  and before  the date of conviction for the first crime.   The third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eight convictions listed in the  information should also, for the same reason, be considered as equivalent  to one for the purpose  of imposing the additional penalty under Article 62, paragraph  5 of the Revised Penal Code.  The  eleventh  conviction should not be  counted as the  date of  commission in said offense is not  stated in  the information and it has  been  held that averment of the commission of  the  previous crime is  essential and habitual delinquency be  taken  into account for  insufficiency of  allegation on  this point  (People <em>vs.</em> Venus,  435;  People  <em>vs.</em> Masonson, 63 Phil.  866;  People  <em>vs.</em>  Topel,  63  Phil 464;  People  <em>vs </em>Ocbina, 63  Phil., 528).  All in all (including the  ninth conviction) there are three convictions  properly to  be  considered  in the imposition of the  additional penalty.  As the case at bar is appellant's  fourth conviction,  pursuant  to  Article  62, Case  No.  5  paragraph  (<em>b</em>), appellant  should be sentenced  to an additional  penalty of prision mayor in  its  minimum  and  medium   periods.   In imposing  this additional  penalty,  recidivism  should not  be taken into account (People <em>vs.</em> De Jesus, supra) the same being inherent  in habitual delinquency (People <em>vs.</em> Bohol, 40  Off. Gaz., 3114). The additional .penalty should therefore be imposed in its  medium period or from '7 years, 4 months and 1  day to 8 years and  8  months of prisi&amp;n , </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We, therefore, correct the additional penalty for habitua delinquency by imposing 8 years of prision mayor.</p>
<p>The fountain pen, which was stolen, should be ordered returned to  the offended party,  or,  in lieu thereof,  the accused should  be ordered  to  pay him P30 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is modified,  as above indicated, without  costs.  It  is  so ordered.</p>
