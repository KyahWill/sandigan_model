				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an action to recover damages for an alleged breach of 
promise to employ. On May 31, 1946, plaintiff was appointed exclusive dealer for 
defendant's International trucks and their attachments for the provinces of 
Laguna, Batangas, Quezon, and Mindoro, with a commission of 10 per cent on all 
sales made by him to <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> residents in his territory, 5 per cent on those 
made to residents of other territories, and 2 per cent on those made by 
defendant at Manila or elsewhere to customers residing in his territory. His 
employment as such was to expire in one year, but defendant reserved to itself 
the right to cancel it at any time, at its discretion and without need of 
giving its reasons therefor. (Exhibit A.) Plaintiff accepted the appointment 
and rendered service accordingly, earning commissions which amounted to 
P7,055.90 in 1946, P32,005.62 in 1947, and P7,650.67 in 1949. (Exhibits D, F, 
and G.) On December 6, 1948, defendant advised plaintiff of the termination of 
his temporary appointment as commission dealer as of December, 1948, and warned 
him that a new agreement would be available to him only if he would show 
progress in establishing the required facilities in his territory. The advice is 
as follows: 
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>EXHIBIT B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">December 6, 1948</span> <p></p>
<p align="justify">Mr. GIL EXCONDE <br>San Pablo, Laguna </p>
<p align="justify">DEAR SIR: </p>
<p align="justify">During the past year or more, we have repeatedly invited your 
attention to the advantage of your establishing your dealer Base-of-Operations 
at San Pablo. A dealership so established would provide for necessary showroom 
space, parts stock and customer's service facilities. </p>
<p align="justify">The need for such facilities in San Pablo is even more apparent 
now than a year ago. Dealer commissions are allowed to provide for such 
establishments. The time has come when we must see some concrete action on your 
part towards these aims. </p>
<p align="justify">Your temporary appointment as commission dealer is terminated 
as of December 31, 1948. A new commission dealer agreement will be available to 
you only if you can show satisfactory progress in the establishment of the 
required facilities on the territory.</p>
<p align="justify">Because of your experience in selling Harvester products and 
because of your friends and business acquaintances in Laguna, we hone you will 
find it possible to meet the requirements necessary to a new contract. </p>
<p align="justify">Very truly yours, </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER COMPANY OP THE PHILIPPINES </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">By (Sgd.) PAUL H. WOOD</p></blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">In anticipation of his appointment, plaintiff subleased a 
parcel of land for 9 years at a monthly rental of P75 (Exhibit H) and 
constructed a small building thereon at a cost of P1,500. This building was 
going to be used as his "Base-of-Operations." He also purchased spare parts from 
defendants for display and sale therein (Exhibits I, I-1 to I-14), and truck 
tires valued at around P4,000 (Exhibit 1-15). </p>
<p align="justify">On March 24, 1949, plaintiff was advised to make immediate 
arrangements to furnish a bond, thus:</p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>EXHIBIT B-7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">March 24, 1949</span><p></p>

<p align="justify">Mr. GIL B. EXCONDE<br>San Pablo City </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">DEALER BOND </p>
<p align="justify">DEAR MR. EXCONDE: </p>
<p align="justify">The printers have almost completed our new Commission Dealer 
Contract Forms and they will soon be ready for signature. However, we are 
informed by the Credit &amp; Collection Department that you have not yet made 
arrangements for a bond. Since, to hold a dealership, it is absolutely necessary 
that you furnish an adequate bond, we suggest that you make the arrangements at 
once. </p>
<p align="justify">Very truly yours, </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">(Sgd.) L. D. HARRISON</p></blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">but up to the time he brought this action on July 26, iy49, he 
had not done so. </p>
<p align="justify">On June 21, 1949, he was informed that his appointment expired 
as of June 30, 1949, for the reason that the manner in which he had "handled 
your territory has been entirely unsatisfactory." (Exhibit C.) </p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff testified that the site of the building where he 
established his "Base-of-Operations" was approved by, and the building 
constructed in accordance with the plans and wishes of, defendant's agents or 
officials; that he was rated as an efficient salesman of the defendant company; 
that his attention had never been called to any irregularity or mismanagement on 
his part as a dealer; and that it is possible that the defendant's inspector, 
who inspected him, had a "disgusto" (misunderstanding) with him. </p>
<p align="justify">Defendant's manager summarized the defendant's reasons for not 
renewing plaintiff's appointment in the following words: </p>
<p align="justify"></p><blockquote>Q. Will you tell the court why no new commission dealer's 
agreement was entered between plaintiff and defendant? <p></p>
<p align="justify">A. Because the defendant (plaintiff) did not have satisfactory 
facilities or comply with our requirements. </p>
<p align="justify">Q. What requirements? </p>
<p align="justify">A. To handle his territory in a manner satisfactory to us; to 
live in his territory; and canvass in systematic manner new customers; he did 
not establish a satisfactory base of operations and he did not file a 
satisfactory bond. (t. s. n., p. 124)</p></blockquote> <p></p>
<p align="justify">As to the building, the same witness for defendant testified 
that plaintiff failed to complete the building in accordance with agreement, 
namely, that he would enlarge the building so that it would be big enough for a 
show room for the trucks, machinery, and equipments sold by it, or put a cement 
floor for all its rooms, provide it with walls on all sides, etc. He further 
testified that plaintiff was in Manila on an average of three days a week, when 
he should spend more time in his territory, and that plaintiff also failed to 
file the bond; that he had been asking plaintiff to complete his building and 
put up his bond, but that plaintiff, in spite of promises, failed to do so. 
According to this witness, plaintiff informed him he could not put up a bond 
because all his properties were mortgaged.</p>
<p align="justify">Both parties introduced as evidence pictures of the building 
which was to be plaintiff's "Base-of-Operations" (Exhibits U, U-1 to U-4). Those 
introduced by defendant (Exhibits 1 and 2) show that the building is small and 
has no sufficient room for display, is not paved and provided with a siding on 
one side. </p>
<p align="justify">The trial court found that the plaintiff failed in the 
following respects: that he did not construct the building in the manner 
indicated or required by defendant, did not put sufficient time in his 
territory, did not cover his territory in a satisfactory manner, and failed to 
file the bond required. The action was, therefore, dismissed. </p>
<p align="justify">On this appeal plaintiff contends that the finding as to the 
condition of the building is not justified by the evidence. It is to be noted 
that no written specifications were made as to the size and conditions of the 
building to be used as "Base-of-Operations." The pictures submitted by 
defendant, Exhibits 1 and 2, fully justify the claim that it has no sufficient 
space for the display of the trucks, machinery, and equipments intended to be 
displayed, since it contains only one small room for the purpose and does not 
have the necessary siding to have said display room safe, nor the necessary and 
convenient pavement for servicing trucks. </p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff also claims that his failure to file a bond is a 
flimsy excuse, as a bond could have been executed upon the execution of the 
contract. It is sufficient to state, in answer, that as early as March 24, 
1949—three months before cancellation—plaintiff was advised to make 
arrangements "at once" for his bond, but that he neglected to comply with the 
requirement. It is true the bond could have been executed immediately before the 
appointment of plaintiff, but it is to be noted that the plaintiff's failure to 
put up the bond was <span style="font-style: italic;">only one</span> of the many Masons, the main reason being the 
"unsatisfactory manner" in which he handled his business. </p>
<p align="justify">The last and most important contention of the 
plaintiff-appellant is that there was "a definite promise on the part of 
defendant to extend to the plaintiff a permanent dealership contract upon the 
establishment of a base-of-operations at San Pablo City." This claim is made to 
rest on the legal proposition that by its supposed acts in "addressing, treating 
and considering plaintiff as its dealer," defendant is now estopped from 
cancelling his appointment as dealer. We find no evidence to support the claim 
of alleged estoppel; on the contrary, the letters of defendant to him plainly 
show otherwise. Thus, the original appointment, Exhibit A, was for a period of 
one year only, and then subject to defendant's, right to cancel it at any time. 
This appointment was supposed to expire by May, 1947, yet no written extension 
was ever given thereafter. On the contrary, on December 6, 1948, he was advised 
of the termination of his "temporary appointment"—which shows that all the 
while plaintiff-appellant was on a temporary or provisional appointment. This 
same advice warned him that he must "show satisfactory progress," and that a new 
agreement "will be available only" if he did so. What clearer language could 
there have been to show that up to that date plaintiff's services were not 
satisfactory? Can a promise of employment be inferred from such a blunt warning, 
so plainly and positively indicative of the dissatisfaction that defendant felt 
over the manner in which plaintiff had conducted his business as dealer? That 
plaintiff was aware that he was not to be favored with the appointment can be 
inferred alone from the fact that he himself recommended another, one Mr. 
Young, to take his place (t. s. n., P-166). The claim of estoppel must be 
dismissed. </p>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff's counsel makes capital out of the fact that 
defendant's letter, Exhibit C, is given the heading of "Cancellation of Dealer's 
Contract." The body of the letter, however, shows that plaintiff has had no 
contract at all. The body of the letter, not its title, governs. Defendant's 
counsel explained that the heading was made by a "<span style="font-style: italic;">layman</span>" and this seems to be 
correct. </p>
<p align="justify">It is not necessary to follow plaintiff-appellant's counsel 
through his hazy and labyrinthine argumentation. It is enough to state that this 
suffers from an erroneous assumptions, i.e., that plaintiff-appellant was 
already a dealer arid his appointment was unjustly cancelled. The evidence shows 
that plaintiff-appellant was never appointed a permanent dealer and was never 
made to believe so. He may have entertained hopes that out of consideration for 
his past services and his attempt to satisfy the demands of his employer, he 
would be appointed in the end. But in order that his action for breach of 
promise may succeed, nothing short of an actual, clear, and positive promise on 
the part of the defendant-appellee must be shown by him by competent evidence. 
His unjustified hopes, perhaps inspired by courteous dealings of the other 
party, do not constitute promise, the breach of which is actionable at law. We 
are fully satisfied that there is absolutely no evidence of the existence of 
such promise, and we find that plaintiff-appellant has failed to establish a 
cause of action against the defendant-appellee. </p>
<p align="justify">We find no reason or ground for disturbing the judgment of 
dismissal appealed from, and we hereby affirm it, with costs against 
plaintiff-appellant.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo,</span> and
