				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 15 April 1946 in the City of Davao, Ang Liongto was shot to death. On 23 
August 1946, an information for murder was filed in the Court of First Instance 
of Davao by the Provincial Fiscal against Dy Too <em>alias</em> Donato Pomarala, 
Chu Chi Beng, John Doe, Richard Doe and three others for the death of Ang 
Liongto (Criminal Case No. 131). On 18 December 1947, another information for 
murder was filed by the Provincial Fiscal, <em>ex-officio </em>City Attorney, 
against James Young for the death of Ang Liongto (Criminal Case No. 343). On 5 
August 1948, a third information for murder was filed against Go Cam, Ang Tiong, 
Lo Bok, Lim Peng, Te Chaye, Sy Bio, Marcos Enage, six other named defendants, 
and twenty-five (25) other unnamed Chinese Davao residents for the death of Ang 
Liongto (Criminal Case No. 458). The last information was signed by Filemon 
Saavedra, a special attorney in the office of the Solicitor General. On 31 
January 1949, counsel for the defendants moved to quash the information, on the 
ground that it does not conform substantially to the prescribed form, and that 
the Court of First Instance of Davao "has no jurisdiction over the case and over 
the persons of the defendants." On 17 February, the court denied the motion to 
quash. A motion for reconsideration was denied.
<p>Thereupon seven defendants named in the last information instituted these 
proceedings seeking to annul the orders of the court denying the motion to quash 
and the motion for reconsideration; to enjoin the Court of First Instance of 
Davao and Special Prosecutor Filemon Saavedra from trying or in anyway disposing 
of the case; and to have the bail filed by the petitioners for their temporary 
release cancelled.</p>
<p>In his answer the respondent Special Prosecutor states that, under and 
pursuant to Administrative Order No. 94 issued by the Secretary of Justice on 13 
May 1948 detailing him "to temporary duty to the province of Davao there to 
investigate and prosecute the murder of Alfonso Ang Liongto," he was empowered 
to sign and file the information against the petitioners and their co-defendants 
in criminal case No. 458 of the Court of First Instance of Davao.</p>
<p>Petitioners claim that a special prosecutor who is a special attorney in the 
office of the Solicitor General created by Republic Act No. 311 is not 
authorized to sign the information filed against the petitioners and their 
co-defendants in the criminal case referred to, and for that reason the 
information signed and filed by him is illegal and the court acquired no 
jurisdiction over the case. Hence the orders denying the motion to quash and the 
motion for reconsideration are null and void.</p>
<p>The Special Prosecutor, on the other hand, contends that his detail by the 
Secretary of Justice, by virtue and pursuant to Administrative Order No. 94 
referred to, confers upon him authority to sign the information filed against 
the petitioners and their co-defendants.</p>
<p>It would serve no useful purpose to restate the grounds upon which the 
decision in the case of Lo Cham <em>vs</em>. Ocampo et al.; Canape et al. 
<em>vs</em>. Jugo et al.; and People <em>vs</em>. Dinglasan (44 Off.Gaz., 
458<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>) is made to rest. There the original 
law and the subsequent changes made until it reached the present form (section 
1686 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by section 4 of Com. Act No. 
144), are set forth. Under either of the interpretations made of the statute, to 
wit: whether the appointment of a lawyer, "being either a subordinate from his 
office or a competent person not in the public service, temporarily to assist a 
fiscal or prosecuting attorney in the discharge of his duties,n confers upon the 
appointee the authority or carries with it the power to sign and file 
informations, or whether such authority is conferred by the express language of 
the statute which clothes the appointee "with the same authority therein as 
might be exercised by the Attorney General or Solicitor General," the respondent 
Special Prosecutor detailed by the Secretary of Justice possesses the authority 
and power to sign and file the information in question. Hence the respondent 
court did not err neither did it exceed its jurisdiction, nor did it commit a 
grave abuse of discretion, when it denied the motion to quash the information 
filed against the petitioners and their co-defendants.</p>
<p>Petition denied, with costs against the petitioners.</p><em>Moran, C. J., 
Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason</em>, and <em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur. <br><br><br>
