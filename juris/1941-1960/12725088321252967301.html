				G.R. No. L-4512, September 30, 1952</h4>
				<H3>JOHN F. GOTUACO, PETITIONER, VS. HON. HIGINIO MACADAEG, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA; L. C. YANG, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of certiorari to annul an order 
of the respondent court dated 4 January 1951 claimed to have been entered in 
excess of its jurisdiction and for a writ to compel the respondent court to 
order the execution of the judgments rendered by the municipal court in civil 
cases Nos. 9959, 9960, 9962 and 9963.

<p align="justify">Petitioner alleges that on 24 December 1949 he brought an 
action for detainer and recovery of rentals against the respondents L. C. Yang, 
Ma Mon Luk, Shin Un Ting and Lee Beng Hoo in the municipal court docketed as 
civil cases Nos. 9959, 9960, 9962 and 9963, respectively. In their answers the 
respondents filed special defenses and counterclaims for P10,216 in the first 
case and P3,105 in the second case for sums deposited on account of rentals and 
for the value of <span style="font-style: italic;">barong-barongs</span> or structures erected on the respective leased 
premises; for P6,415 in the third case for the value of the <span style="font-style: italic;">barong-barong</span> or 
structure erected on the leased premises and recovery of alleged excessive 
rentals paid to the petitioner; and for P2,032.50 in the fourth case for 
recovery of alleged excessive rentals paid to the petitioner. A motion to 
dismiss the counterclaim in each case was filed by the petitioner on the ground 
that the amounts sought to be recovered by the respondents are beyond the 
jurisdiction of the municipal court. The respondents, in turn, filed motions to 
dismiss the complaints on the ground that there was a pending action in the 
Court of First Iinstance of Manila between the same parties docketed in said 
court as civil case No. 10103 filed on 16 January 1950 and amended on 10 
February 1950 to include as plaintiffs other defendants in the detainer cases. 
In the case referred to the respondents sought to recover the amounts claimed in 
the counterclaims filed by them in the detainer cases. Before proceeding with 
the trial in the detainer cases the municipal court dismissed the counterclaims 
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction but allowed to remain in the answers as 
special defenses. The motion to dismiss the complaint in the detainer cases was 
denied. After trial the defendants in the detainer cases were ordered 
to vacate the premises and to pay to the plaintiff the accrued and unpaid 
rentals from March 1949 to December 1949 amounting to P3,884 and P400 a month 
thereafter until the defendant vacates and. surrenders the possession of the 
premises to the plaintiff with costs in the first case; to pay the accrued and 
unpaid rentals from May 1949 to December 1949 amounting to P1,450 and P200 a 
month thereafter until possession of the premises shall have been restored to 
the plaintiff with costs in the second case; to pay the rentals due and unpaid 
from July 1949 to December 1949 amounting to P1,140 and P200 thereafter until 
the defendant vacates and surrenders the possession of the premises to the 
plaintiff with costs in the third case; and to pay the rentals due and unpaid 
from June 1949 to December 1949 amounting to P1,325 and P220 monthly thereafter 
until the defendant moves out and restores the possession of the premises to the 
plaintiff with costs in the fourth case. From said judgments the defendants 
appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila where the cases were docketed 
as civil Nos. 11832, 11833, 11834 and 11835. On 18 August 1950 the petitioner 
filed in said four appealed cases motions for execution on the ground that the 
defendants therein, the respondents herein, had not paid to the petitioner nor 
deposited in court the sums of money to which the petitioner was entitled as 
adjudged by the municipal court, nor filed a supersedeas bond to guarantee the 
payment thereof, nor paid or deposited in court the sums of money as 
compensation for the use and occupation of the premises up to the month of July 
1950. The respondents did not deny that they had failed to pay to the petitioner 
or deposit in court the sums to which the petitioner was entitled as adjudged by 
the municipal court, but objected to the motion for execution on the ground that 
there was a pending action in the Court of First Instance of Manila for 
reimbursement of the value of improvements and that, if successful, they were 
entitled to secure an order restraining the execution of the judgments rendered 
by the municipal court. At the hearing of the motion for execution the 
petitioner offered to put up a bond to guarantee the payment of whatever amount 
might be found due the respondents, the plaintiffs in civil case No. 10103, and 
reiterated the offer on the resumption of the hearing in said civil case, but 
the motion for execution was denied by the respondent court in an order dated 4 
January 1951 upon the grounds advanced by the respondents, the defendants in the 
appealed detainer cases and plaintiffs in civil case No. 10103. </p>
<p align="justify">In their answer the respondents practically admit the foregoing 
facts. However, during the pendency of this case the respondents, the defendants 
in the appealed detainer cases, the plaintiff, the herein petitioner, would be 
dismissed on the ground that the Court of First Instance of Manila had dismissed 
the appealed detainer cases and rendered judgment for the defendants, the 
plaintiffs in civil case No. 10103, upholding their claim and right to be 
reimbursed for improvements or structures erected by them on the leased premises 
and ordering the petitioner, the plaintiff in the appealed detainer cases and 
defendant in civil case No. 10103, to pay P7,806 to L. C. Yang; P5,305 to Shih 
Un Ting; P1,825 to Ma Mon Luk; P1,650 to Uy Tun; and P355 to Lee Beng Hoo. </p>
<p align="justify">For failure of the defendants, the herein respondents, to pay 
or deposit the rentals due and unpaid as found by the municipal court or to file 
a supersedeas bond to guarantee the payment thereof and to pay thereafter the 
monthly rentals or compensation for the use and occupation of the leased 
premises during the pendency of the appealed detainer cases, filed a motion 
praying that the petition be entitled to have the judgments rendered by the 
municipal court executed. A denial of the motion for such execution would be a 
clear violation of the Rule on the matter. Mandamus would lie to compel the 
Court to issue a writ of execution. But the detainer cases having been disposed 
of against the petitioner, the plaintiff in said cases, by the Court of First 
Instance on appeal, there is no legal way of annulling the order denying the 
motion for execution and of directing the respondent court to issue a writ of 
execution because the judgments for which execution was asked were reversed by a 
higher court on appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is dismissed, without costs. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Jugo,
