				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Those who go up to Baguio by car may remember or may be familiar with that 
stretch of road between the town of Sison and the beginning of the Kennon road 
that goes up to Baguio, near the Kennon bridge. For several hundred meters, this 
road follows the contour of and hugs the mountains to the right, while to the 
left is the Bued river, wide but shallow, part of whose bed is dry during the 
summer months. On this highway is to be found the concrete Doñgon bridge, scene 
of the ghastly crime involved in this case.
<p>At the beginning of the Pacific War, and when the Japanese landed on Northern 
Luzon, In their retreat toward Bataan, the USAFFE forces blasted the southern 
end of this bridge which then became impassable until repaired about the end of 
1947, or about the beginning of 1948. In the meantime, people driving up to 
Baguio from Sison, at a point still far from said bridge, had to make a detour 
to the left until they reached the road running from Rosario to Baguio, then 
turned to the right, crossed the Kennon bridge and then turned to the left to go 
up Kennon road toward the Summer Capital. So, the Doñgon bridge became an 
isolated spot. This explanation is deemed necessary in order to understand the 
sketch (Exh. "O"), trace the route taken by the parties involved in this case, 
from the barrio of Artacho, Sison, Pangasinan to Doñgon bridge on the afternoon 
of June 12, 1947, as well as establish the nature of said bridge as a secluded 
and uninhabited) place. Late that afternoon, two women and four men accompanied 
by one of the appellants and conspirators, named Irineo Boñgog, all riding in 
one Jeep, were lured into and held up on this Doñgon were killed bridge. Three 
of them were killed by gunfire and then despoiled of their belongings, 
principally money amounting to P33,000.. Later about midnight Boñgog, because he 
was not given his share of the loot, and apparently to simulate innocence, 
reported the hold up and killing to the police in Sison, but without revealing 
the identity of the robbers and killers, much less, his connection with the 
conspiracy.</p>
<p>Very early the next day, police authorities from Sison went to Doñgon bridge 
where a most gruesome spectacle met their eyes. On the bridge itself was a 
burned jeep and under it was the charred body of a man who later was identified 
as Frederico Sarmiento. Behind the jeep toward the north and on the left 
embankment of the road was the dead body of Margarita Surisantos Maneclang and 
further north below the embankment or rather on a dry portion of the bed of the 
river was the dead body of Leonor Calderon. The three bodies bore several mortal 
bullet wounds. The nearest house to the scene of the killing was about 200 
meters away up the mountain side to the right. All these details are graphically 
shown on the sketch (Exh. "O").</p>
<p>As a result of the investigation of the police authorities, Irineo Boñgog was 
suspected as forming part of the gang that effected the hold up and the killing 
and so was detained. Pedro Pulido and Crestituto Quinto, <em>alias</em> Tito 
Quinto, were later arrested. Pulido was taken to Doñgon bridge where in the 
presence of Capt, Hidalgo and Lt, Perez and two soldiers, all of the Military 
Police, he re-enacted the hold up and shooting which resulted in the killing and 
robbery of the three victims. Still later, Delfin Gomez and Nicasio Magdaraog 
were arrested. During their confinement and investigation by the Military Police 
in Dagupan, prisoners Quinto, Bongog and Pulido signed and ratified before the 
Justice of the Peace of Dagupan, three statements (Exhs. G, H, and I), 
respectively. The five prisoners, and. Benjamin Esuagen <em>alias</em> "Ben" and 
Santiago Sipos <em>alias</em> "Ago" both of whom have never been arrested, were 
charged with multiple murder before the Justice of the Peace Court of Sison, 
which court after proper proceedings sent the case up to the Court of First 
Instance of Pangasinan where the Provincial Fiscal changed the charge to robbery 
in band with multiple homicide. This new complaint was preliminarily 
investigated by the Justice of the Peace of the capital of the province who 
later elevated the case to the Court of First Instance. In that court, the 
complaint was further amended, dropping Esuagen and Sipos as defendants for the 
reason that they were still at large. Before the trial, upon the recommendation 
of the prosecuting attorney, Delfin Gomez was discharged from the information in 
order to utilize him as a Government witness.</p>
<p>After trial the lower court presided over by Judge Ceferino de los Santos 
acquitted Nicasio Magdaraog, but "declared, the defendants Pedro Pulido, Ireneo 
Boñgog, and Tito Quinto guilty as principals beyond reasonable doubt of the 
crime with which they are charged in the information and imposes upon them the 
penalty of DEATH by electrocution; to return or pay, jointly and severally, the 
amount of P22,000 to the heirs of Margarita Surisantos Maneclang, and the sum of 
P11,000 to the heirs of Federico Sarmiento; to indemnify, jointly and severally, 
the heirs of each of the victims Margarita Surisantos Maneclang, Leonor 
Calderon, and Federico Sarmiento in the sum of P8,000.00 for each victim; and, 
to pay three-fourths of the costs." This case is now here for review.</p>
<p>Piecing the different pieces of the evidence consisting of the testimonies of 
the witnesses for the prosecution and the defense, the written statements or 
admissions made by the appellants and the other exhibits, like we do in a cross 
word puzzle, the resulting picture may be described briefly as follows.</p>
<p>With the establishment of the American Military and Naval Bases in the 
Philippines after Liberation, particularly in Northern Luzon, such as Base M in 
San Fernando, La Union and the Munitions dump at Rosario, same province, through 
pilferage, sometimes, with the active connivance of the persons in charge 
thereof as well as those detailed to guard the same, explosives, such as 
dynamite and blasting caps, in large quantities were channeled from said bases 
into the hands of civilians, especially fishermen who used them to illegally 
catch fish in rivers, particularly in Lingayen Gulf, There developed an illegal 
traffic in this prohibited commodity on a more or less large scale, and the 
business of "buy and sell" with its inevitable agents and middlemen, with which 
tie have become familiar during the Japanese occupation flourished anew, but 
with an innovation or added factor. There sprang groups of people who because of 
lack of capital could not engage in the business, or, spurning the illegal, tho 
profitable traffic in this prohibited article as being too slow or its profits 
as insufficient, found and developed a shortcut or easier way of making money by 
pretending to have dynamite or blasting caps, luring prospective buyers to a 
lonely spot and robbing them of the purchase money carried by them, even killing 
them in order to eliminate all chances of detection thru witnesses. This was 
exactly what happened in the present case. The three appellants in this 
case—Pulido, Bongog, and Quinto and their associates Esuagen and Sipos, were 
engaged in this highly profitable but infamous business or racket off and on 
during 1947.</p>
<p>About June 10 of the same year, these five men met in the barrio of Artacho, 
town of Sison, and decided to renew or to give more impetus to their slackening 
business. Pulido, Boñgog, and Quinto were designated to look for prospective 
buyers of blasting caps. That same day, the three met Delfin Gomez who was 
passing by the barrio of Artacho, Sison on his way to his town, Sual, 
Pangasinan. Boñgog who was acting as spokesman for the three asked him if he was 
interested in blasting caps. Gomez who saw profit in the business said that he 
would look for buyers, and to assure a reasonable margin of profit for himself, 
he bargained and succeeded in having the price of P8,000 a box reduced to 
P7,500. In the afternoon Gomez accompanied by Boñgog went to Dagupan and 
contacted Leonor Calderon, an agent who also promised to look for blasting cap 
buyers. After staying in her house Gomez and Bongog returned to Artacho, Sison, 
in the morning of the 12th with the assurance of Leonor that later she would 
follow; them with a buyer. True enough, that same morning Leonor arrived at 
Artacho, accompanied by a buyer, Margarita Surisantos Maneclang who had with her 
P22,000 in bills, some of which were in large denominations.</p>
<p>In the meantime, and independent of and alien to the plan and measures made 
and taken by the three accused and their associates, Nicasio Magdaraog acting as 
an agent on his own, had been trying to interest Frederico Sarmiento of 
Urdaneta, Pangasinan in the purchase of No. 7 blasting caps. But Sarmiento was 
interested only in No. 10 blasting caps. In going to the town of Rosario where 
the military munitions dump was located looking for No. 10 blasting caps, 
Magdaraog accompanied by Jesus Ostrea, counsin-in-law of Sarmiento, met Leonor 
Calderon and learned from her that Bongog and his associates had plenty of 
blasting caps for sale, apparently the kind wanted by Sarmiento. Ostrea was 
dispatched to Urdaneta to call his cousin-in-law. Later that afternoon of June 
12, 1947, Ostrea arrived at Artacho accompanied by Sarmiento who brought with 
him P11,000, with which to buy blasting caps. Pulido who seems to be, if not the 
mastermind, at least the most active member of the gang, told the prospective 
buyers that he had five cases of blasting caps but which he dared not bring or 
show in public because of their prohibited nature. At the beginning, Leonor and 
Margarita were insisting that they be shown samples of the blasting caps before 
they would seriously consider the purchase thereof. Pulido, pretending to secure 
samples, left but later returned saying that he did not succeed in his mission 
for the reason that the Military Police were confiscating blasting caps and 
furthermore, his uncle who was really the owner of the blasting caps refused to 
open any of the boxes in order to get samples therefrom. Magdaraog showed some 
impatience and said that as long as Pulido and his companions had the stock for 
sale, they could very well dispense with seeing samples thereof. The parties—the 
buyers Sarmiento and Margarita and their agents Magdaraog and Delfin Gomez and 
Leonor, on one side, and the accused represented by Pulido, on the other, 
finally closed the deal. Pulido left them ostensibly to secure the mythical five 
cases of blasting caps and place them at the disposal of the buyers at a 
secluded spot secure from the eyes of the Military Police. He instructed the 
buyers to follow later and go to Doñgon bridge and once there, call out his name 
"Pedro". His associate Boñgog was detailed to accompany the purchasers. Pulido 
had gone to make the final arrangements and put the finishing touches to their 
dastardly scheme. He rounded up his companions Qulnto, Esuagen, and Sipos and 
took them to Doñgon bridge to await the arrival of their victims. Pulido and 
Quinto were provided with a carbine and aQgrand rifle, respectively, while Sipos 
carried a Thompson Submachine gun.</p>
<p>About 6:00 o'clock that afternoon the party of purchasers left Artacho, 
Sison, in a Jeep bound for Doñgon bridge. Sarmiento was at the wheel. To his 
right were the two women—Margarita and Leonor, and at the extreme end of the 
front seat was Nicasio Magdaraog. Seated on the back seat were Jesus Ostrea en 
the left and to his right was Gomez. On the right tool box was seated 
Boñgog.</p>
<p>As stated at the beginning of this decision, the party could not take the 
direct road straight to Dongon bridge because the road from Artacho to that 
bridge was impassable; and so they went around to the left until they reached 
the road from Rosario to Kennon road, turned to the right and crossed the Kennon 
bridge. To apprise drivers of other vehicles who may be coming from the opposite 
direction, Sarmiento snapped on his headlights but after leaving the bridge and 
turning to the right toward Dongon bridge, he put out his lights and continued 
driving up to their destination. On reaching Doñgon bridge, the party saw that a 
large branch of an acacia tree, with fresh leaves, had been placed across the 
southern end of the bridge so as to bar any further advance of the vehicle. 
This, aside from the fact as already stated that the southern end of the bridge 
had been blasted. Sarmiento got down from the jeep and walked forward presumably 
to see or investigate the condition of the blasted end of the bridge and to look 
more closely at the acacia branch laid across it. In order to give way to 
Bongog, who went down the jeep in order to give the signal, Magdaraog had to go 
down first but later it seems that he returned to his seat. Boñgog walked 
forward about seven meters in front of the jeep and called out the name of Pedro 
about twice. Almost immediately thereafter, a burst of fire from at least two 
guns greeted the party. Sarmiento visibly hit, held up his hands and retreated 
but the firing continued and he fell to the ground dead. Magdaraog got down from 
the jeep in a hurry and ran northward and was able to escape. The two women also 
jumped down from the jeep and scurried northward behind the vehicle in a 
crouching position either to avoid the continuous fire or because they had 
already been hit. Delfin Gomez before and in the act of jumping down from the 
jeep and attracted by the source of the fire, distinctly saw Pulido in a 
kneeling position in front of the jeep and about six meters away firing a gun in 
the direction of the jeep. Three meters behind him was Quinto also firing a long 
gun whom Gomez also saw and identified. Jesus Ostrea told the court that he also 
saw Pulido firing a gun in the position already described but although he saw a 
man behind him also in the act of firing, he could not identify said person. 
Both Gomez and Ostrea, running northward and away from their assailants were 
able to escape by jumping off the road into the ravine and later making for the 
mountains. During their flight they both saw the two women crouching and 
crawling away from the jeep.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Pulido, Quinto, Bongog, Esuagen and Sipos searched and robbed 
their three dead victims—Sarmiento, Leonor and Margarita. Esuagen lifted the 
body of Sarmiento, placed it under the jeep and then set fire to the vehicle. 
The bodies of the two women were flung down the embankment.</p>
<p>The defense of <em>alibi</em> interposed by appellants Pulido and Quinto was 
correctly rejected by the trial court on the ground that even assuming that they 
were really at the places where they claim to have been that afternoon of June 
12, 1947 they could well and easily have gone to the scene of the crime to 
commit it. Moreover, although Pulido claims that afternoon he had borrowed a 
horse from a friend and ridden it in search of an astray cow, a disinterested 
witness for the prosecution, who lived not very far from Dongon bridge, told the 
court that shortly before 6:30 that afternoon he had seen Pulido and Quinto 
riding on a horse pass near his house.</p>
<p>Boñgog, one of the appellants herein, naturally, could not put up the same 
defense of alibi for the reason that he was riding in the same jeep with the 
persons who were held up and killed by his co-defendants. But he insists that he 
merely went to accompany the party that was supposed to buy blasting caps from 
Pulido and his companions at Doñgon bridge. There are several reasons for 
believing and finding Boñgog as having taken part in the conspiracy, at least to 
rob the victims if not also to kill them. When Bongog, Pulido, and Quinto tried 
and succeeded in interesting Delfin Gomez in the purchase of blasting caps on 
June 10, 1947, it was he (Boñgog) who acted as spokesman for the trio. In fact 
he accompanied Gomez to Dagupan to look for prospective buyers, and that fateful 
afternoon of June 12th, it was he who accompanied and acted as a guide to the 
party of agents and buyers, and, what is more important, upon their arrival at 
Dongon bridge, it was he who gave the signal for the hold up and, possibly, also 
for the firing, by calling out the name of Pedro Pulido twice. If he were an 
innocent party, merely asked to accompany the purchasers, without any 
understanding or connivance with the robbers and killers, he could very well 
have called out the name of Pedro Pulido from his seat inside the jeep, but that 
would have imperiled his life because at the start of the shooting the 
assailants' fire was mostly concentrated on the jeep and its occupants. So, he 
had to get down from the vehicle which he did. Furthermore, the fact that in 
spite of the intense firing from Pulido, Quinto and Sipos, Bongog received nob 
even a scratch, while Sarmiento who had also gotten down from the jeep and 
walked foward and was standing not far from him, was hit, showed that the firing 
was not intended for him, and that it was purposely withheld until he had 
negotiated a sufficient and safe distance from the jeep and its passengers. 
Moreover, his written statement (Exhibit H), definitely links him with the 
conspiracy.</p>
<p>In this connection, we shall have to rule upon the admissibility and 
competence of the three written statements (Exhs. G, H, and I) of Quinto, 
Boiigog and Pulido, respectively, for the reason that the three appellants claim 
that said statements were given under duress and to avoid further torture by the 
Military Police. We have carefully examined the evidence on this point and we 
are convinced that all the three statements were given voluntarily without undue 
pressure and without any promise of clemency or reward. With the exception tat 
of Pulido, the defendants were unable and failed to show either to the trial 
court or to the provincial fiscal or the justice of the peace, anything on their 
persons showing any sign or trace of any torture or maltreatment. When they 
appeared before Justice of the Peace Hermitaño to sign and ratify their 
statements they made no complaints or remark in this regard. It is true that at 
the trial Pulido, alleging manhandling, showed a scar on his forehead, but it 
was satisfactorily explained by Capt. Hidalgo and Lt. Perez to the Court. 
According to them, one day upon returning to Dagupan from Doñgon bridge where 
Pulido had re-enacted the commission of the crime, they were overtaken by a six 
by six truck and Pulido who was in their jeep and under custody, jumped from it, 
almost right in the path of the truck, either to commit suicide or to escape. 
Fortunately, the wheels of the truck missed him by a matter of inches. The two 
military police privates guarding him in the jeep jumped down and handled him 
rather roughly believing that he was trying to escape, and the wound on his 
forehead may have been caused by said rough handling or by his rolling over and 
along the road after he jumped from the running jeep.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that in none of the three statements (Exhs. G, H, and I) did 
the affiants admit having taken part in the killing. Boñgog, although admitting 
having taken part in the conspiracy, limited the object thereof to merely 
holding up the victims &amp;n&amp; not to inflict any injuries, much less kill 
them. Pulido and Quinto, although admitting having carried a carbine and a 
Garand rifle, respectively, said that they did not take any part whatsoever in 
the killing because although he (Pulido) pressed the trigger of his carbine 
three times, it did not fire; and as to Quinto, he said that his Garand rifle 
was snatched away from him by Ben Suagen. If there had really been undue 
pressure, intimidation, or torture by the Military Police to the extent that the 
three affiants no longer had a will of their own and merely followed whatever 
the police wanted and indicated, to insure conviction for the killing of the 
victims, it would have been easy and convenient to have included in the three 
affidavits admissions and statements of a conspiracy not only to rob but also to 
kill, even actual participation in the actual killing. But this was not done. 
Besides, the affidavits contain so many details that could, have been known only 
to the three appellants but which was difficult or even impossible for the 
Military Police to invent and include in the affidavits. Another consideration 
which should not be overlooked is that although Delfin Gomez and Nicasio 
Magdaraog were strongly suspected by the Military Police as being members of the 
conspiracy and were in fact arrested and held by the Military Police, to say 
nothing of their being included in the complaint or information, unlike the 
three appellants, these two did not subscribe any affidavit linking themselves 
with the conspiracy. All these circumstances persuade and convince us that the 
three statements (Exhs. G, H, and I) were made voluntarily and are competent and 
admissible evidence.</p>
<p>The fact that Bongog reported the robbery to the police authorities of Sison, 
may at first blush appear perplexing if not intriguing, and his counsel seizes 
upon this circumstance to bolster his argument that Bongog would not have done 
this if he were really guilty. Of course, the perpetrators of a crime, 
especially one as hideous as that we have under consideration, do not usually 
report the matter to the authorities just to be, arrested and punished, unless 
they have a good defense, such as self-defense in a crime of homicide or 
physical injuries. But as the trial court has well observed, Bongog may have 
made the report in order to divert suspicion and lead the authorities to believe 
that since he reported the crime, he could not have possibly have taken part in 
it. Another explanation which the record reveals is that Bongog, despite his 
connection with the conspiracy and his active participation in executing and 
carrying it out, was, according to him omitted in the apportionment of the loot, 
this, altho he knew that there was much of it. Furthermore, in making the report 
to the police of Sison, he was careful in excluding himself from any connection 
with or participation in the commission of the crime. He pictured himself as an 
innocent passenger in the jeep, merely requested by the two women victims to 
accompany them and act as their guide. To his simple mind, at the time, in 
making the report he was leading the authorities away from his trail because he 
made himself appear as a mere innocent bystander, but at the same time getting 
even with his co-conspirators who had double-crossed him.</p>
<p>As to the identification of Pulido and Quinto, we are satisfied that the two 
were seen and sufficiently identified by Gomez while he was seated in the jeep 
and while jumping down from it to flee from the firiog. According to him, Pulido 
was not more than six meters away from the jeep at the time, while Quinto was 
only about three meters behind Pulido, both in the act of firing their guns. 
Ostrea who was sitting beside Gomez on the back seat also saw these two men in 
the act of firing. He could identify Pulido, but not the man behind him. The 
fact that Ostrea did not identify Quinto, although he could have done so without 
much fear of contradiction, speaks well for his sincerity and truthfulness.</p>
<p>As to whether at the time of the hold up and shooting, it was still clear and 
bright for one to see and identify a person several meters away, the evidence 
reveals that at about 6:30 p.m. that month of June, although the sun may have 
been setting or may have even set, it was still bright. It will be remembered 
that in driving from Kennon bridge southward to Doñgon bridge, Sarmiento did not 
use the lights of the jeep, showing that there was sufficient light from the sun 
either direct or reflected from the sky, to permit safe driving over a mountain 
road.</p>
<p>It Is true, of course, that at the time the three deceased were engaged or 
were engaging in illegal traffic, trying to buy a prohibited article. They were 
not exactly innocent, law-abiding citizens. At the same time their open, even 
habitual disregard of the law could not in any way minimize the enormity of much 
less justify this cold-blooded slaughter. There was absolutely no necessity or 
reason for the killing, at least from the standpoint of a successful execution 
of the plan of robbery. It was not necessary to fire a single shot to bring the 
jeep to a stop because it was already at a standstill, and besides, its further 
progress was blocked not only by the acacia branch purposely laid across the 
bridge but also by the blasted condition of the southern end of the said bridge. 
There was no necessity for killing the victims because surprised and caught 
unawares, in all probability, they would not and could not have offered any 
resistance against Pulido, Quinto, Esuagen and Sipos, three of whom were armed 
with automatic weapons. This, aside from the fact that Ireneo Boñgog, a 
co-conspirator was armed with a revolver and in case of resistance by the 
victims would assuredly, have helped his co-conspirators. The only conceivable 
object for the massacre was to liquidate all possible witnesses to the robbery. 
This may be inferred from the fact that after the shooting, one of the accused 
remarked that three of the party, obviously referring to Gomez, Ostrea, and 
Magdaraog were able to escape; and forthwith, the conspirators dispersed to 
hunt/them but because of the ensuing darkness, rough terrain and vegetation, and 
inasmuch as they had a head start while the conspirators were busy robbing their 
dead victims, Gomez, Ostrea and Magdaraog were able to escape.</p>
<p>The crime committed was that of robbery with homicide. In its commission we 
should consider the following circumstances. Sipos, Pulido and Quinto were each 
carrying a Thompson Submachine Gun, a carbine and a Garand rifle, respectively, 
and actually used them on the victims. Boñgog was carrying a revolver, although 
he does not appear to have actually used it. The crime was therefore committed 
by a band. The trial court found that the crime was committed with evident 
premeditation. On this point we have our doubts. It is settled that evident 
premeditation is inherent in the crime of robbery. So, to warrant a finding of 
the attendance of this aggravating circumstance in the complex crime of robbery 
with homicide, it must be linked with and considered with the killing, (U.S. 
<em>vs</em>. Landasan, 35 Phil. 365.) But there is no evidence that the 
conspirators previously planned and agreed to kill the victims. The lower court 
also found the crime attended by the aggravating circumstance of treachery. That 
is correct. The sudden and unexpected attack with firearms resulting in the 
death of the unsuspecting and helpless victims constituted treachery. The 
commission of the crime was further attended by the aggravating circumstance of 
craft. The victims were lured into going to Doñgon bridge which at the time was 
an isolated spot because it was the end of the road and no one would or could 
pass there because of the blasted condition of the southern end thereof (as 
shown by Exh. "O"), U.S. <em>vs</em>. Gampoña et al., 36 Phil. 817. The crime 
was also committed in an uninhabited place. According to the Sergeant of Police 
who made an investigation on the spot, the nearest house was about 200 yards 
away up the mountain side (p. 940, t. s. n.), and from the data that can be 
gathered from the record, including the sketch (Exh. "O"), Doñgon bridge was not 
easily accessible because of the trees and other vegetation that stood between 
said house and the bridge, to say nothing of the rough terrain. There is even 
reason to believe that Dongon bridge was not visible from the house. It is also 
obvious that the bridge was purposely sought and chosen by the appellants in 
order to avoid detection of the crime and preclude any interference with its 
commission or any help to the victims. There was also the circumstance that the 
crime was committed by attacking a vehicle. With the attendance of all these 
circumstances, the case comes under the provisions of Art. 295 of the Rev. Penal 
Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 12, Section 2, which provides for the 
imposition of the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death corresponding 
to the complex crime of robbery with homicide in its maximum period, namely, 
death.</p>
<p>We notice however, that at the time Quinto testified in Court in December, 
1947, he gave his age as eighteen, and there is no evidence to disprove his 
claim as to his age. It is, consequently, obvious that at the time of the 
commission of the crime in June of the same year, he was less than eighteen. We 
therefore have to apply the provisions of Art, 68, par. 2 of the Rev. Penal Code 
which provides that upon an offender over fifteen and under eighteen years of 
age, the penalty next lower that that prescribed by law shall be imposed. As 
already stated, the penalty imposed by the law on the crime herein committed is 
death. The penalty next lower is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we find the guilt of the appellants to have been 
established beyond reasonable doubt. On Crestituto (Tito) Quinto, the penalty of 
death imposed by the trial court is hereby reduced to reclusion perpetua. With 
regard to Pedro Pulido and Irineo Bongog, it becomes our painful duty to affirm 
the death penalty imposed upon them by the trial court. With this modification, 
the decision appealed from, is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>
<p>The penalty of death imposed upon Pulido and Boñgog will be carried out and 
executed on a day to be fixed by the trial court, within thirty days after the 
return of the record of the case to the said court.</p>
