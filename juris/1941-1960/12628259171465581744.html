				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the Court of First Instance of Manila, Marina Padan, Jose&nbsp; Fajardo&nbsp; y Garcia,&nbsp; Cosme&nbsp; Espinosa,&nbsp; and&nbsp; Ernesto Reyes&nbsp; were charged with a violation of Article 201&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; said&nbsp; to&nbsp; have&nbsp; been committed&nbsp; as follows: <br><blockquote>That&nbsp; on&nbsp; or&nbsp; about the 13th day of September, 1953,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; city of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; Philippines, the said accused conspiring&nbsp; and&nbsp; confederating together&nbsp; and mutually&nbsp; helping one&nbsp; another,&nbsp; did then&nbsp; and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously&nbsp; exhibit&nbsp; or cause to be exhibited inside a building at the corner of Camba Ext. and Morga Ext., Tondo, this City, immoral&nbsp; scenes and&nbsp; acts, to&nbsp; wit: the&nbsp; said accused Jose&nbsp; Fajador y Garcia,&nbsp; being then&nbsp; the&nbsp; manager&nbsp; and Ernesto Reyes y&nbsp; Yabut, as ticket&nbsp; collector and&nbsp; or exhibitor,&nbsp; willfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and&nbsp; feloniously&nbsp; hired their&nbsp; co-accused&nbsp; Marina Palan y Alova and Cosme&nbsp; Espinosa y Abordo to act&nbsp; as performers or&nbsp; exhibitionists to perform and in fact performed&nbsp; sexual intercourse in&nbsp; the&nbsp; presence of many&nbsp; spectators, thereby&nbsp; exhibiting or performing&nbsp; highly immoral and&nbsp; indecent acts&nbsp; or shows thereat."</blockquote>Upon arraignment, all pleaded not&nbsp; guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, however, Marina Padan, with the assistance&nbsp; of her counsel de parte and counsel de&nbsp; oflcio, asked for&nbsp; permission to Withdraw her former plea of not guilty, which was granted, and upon rearraignment, she pleaded guilty to the charge. In a decision dated October 12, 1953, Marina Padan was found guilty as&nbsp; charged and sentenced to six months and one day of&nbsp; <i>prision correccional</i> and a fine of P200, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, not&nbsp; to exceed one-third of the&nbsp; principal penalty, with the accessory penalties prescribed&nbsp; by the law, and&nbsp; to pay the proportionate&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; After&nbsp; trial of the three&nbsp; remaining&nbsp; accused, they were all found guilty; Cosme Espinosa and Ernesto Reyes were&nbsp; sentenced each to not less than six months and one day of <i>prision correccional</i> and not more than one year, one month and eleven days of <i>prision correctional</i>, to pay a fine of P500,&nbsp; with&nbsp; subsidiary&nbsp; imprisonment&nbsp; in case of insolvency, not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; proportionate&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose Fajardo was sentenced to not less than&nbsp; one&nbsp; year,&nbsp; one&nbsp; month&nbsp; and ten days of&nbsp; <i>prision&nbsp; correccional </i>and not more&nbsp; than one year eight months and twenty days, also of <i>prision correccional</i>, to pay&nbsp; a fine of P1,000, with subsidiary imprisonment in case&nbsp; of&nbsp; insolvency, not to exceed one-third of the principal penalty&nbsp; and to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the proportionate costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The army steel bed, the army woolen blanket, the pillow, the&nbsp; ladies' panties,&nbsp; and the men's underwear, described in Exhibit C, were declared confiscated. <br><br>The four accused&nbsp; appealed in the decision,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal having&nbsp; been sent to&nbsp; us.&nbsp; Appellants Espinosa and&nbsp; Reyes failed to file their briefs within the period&nbsp; prescribed&nbsp; by law&nbsp; and their appeal was&nbsp; dismissed by resolution of this Court of November 25, 1955, and the decision as to them became final and executory&nbsp; on January 7, 1956, as appears from the entry&nbsp; of judgment. <br><br>Because of her plea of guilty in the lower court,&nbsp; appellant Marina in her appeal does not question her conviction; she merely&nbsp; urges the reduction&nbsp; of&nbsp; the penalty by&nbsp; eliminating&nbsp; the prison sentence.&nbsp; We do not feel warranted in interfering with the exercise&nbsp; of discretion&nbsp; in this matter, made by&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court presided&nbsp; by Judge&nbsp; Magno&nbsp; S. Gatmaitan.&nbsp; According to his decision of October 12, 1953, in imposing the sentence, he&nbsp; already considered Marina's plea of leniency, and&nbsp; so despite&nbsp; the recommendation&nbsp; of the fiscal that she be fined P600.00 in&nbsp; addition to the prison sentence of six months and&nbsp; one&nbsp; day, his&nbsp; honor&nbsp; reduced the fine to only P200. <br><br>We believe that the&nbsp; penalty imposed fits the crime, considering its seriousness.&nbsp; As&nbsp; far&nbsp; as&nbsp; we know, this is the first time&nbsp; that the courts in this jurisdiction, at least this Tribunal,&nbsp; have been called upon to take cognizance&nbsp; of an offense&nbsp; against morals&nbsp; and&nbsp; decency of this&nbsp; kind.&nbsp; We have had&nbsp; occasion to consider offenses like&nbsp; the exhibition of still&nbsp; or moving pictures&nbsp; of women in the nude, which we&nbsp; have&nbsp; condemned&nbsp; for obscenity&nbsp; and as offensive&nbsp; to morals.&nbsp; In those cases, one might yet claim that there was involved the element of art; that connoisseurs of the same, and&nbsp; painters and&nbsp; sculptors might find inspiration in the showing of pictures in the nude,&nbsp; or the human body exhibited&nbsp; in sheer nakedness, as models in tableaux&nbsp;&nbsp; vivants. But&nbsp; an actual exhibition of&nbsp; the&nbsp; sexual act, preceded by acts of lasciviousness,&nbsp; can have no redeeming feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; In it, there is no room for&nbsp; art.&nbsp; One can see nothing in&nbsp; it but&nbsp; clear&nbsp; and unmitigated obscenity,&nbsp; indecency,&nbsp; and an offense to public morals, inspiring and causing&nbsp; as it does, nothing but lust and lewdness, and exerting a&nbsp; corrupting- influence&nbsp; specially on&nbsp; the youth of the land.&nbsp; We repeat&nbsp; that because of all this, the penalty&nbsp; imposed by&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court on&nbsp; Marina, despite her plea&nbsp; of&nbsp; guilty,&nbsp; is neither&nbsp; excessive&nbsp; nor&nbsp; unreasonable. <br><br>Going to the appeal of Jose Fajardo&nbsp; y&nbsp; Garcia,&nbsp; while&nbsp; he does not deny the fact of the commission of the offense&nbsp; charged, he insists that he was not the manager or the imperson incharge of the show&nbsp; or proceedings on the night&nbsp; of September&nbsp; 13, 1953; that&nbsp; his participation,&nbsp; if&nbsp; he participated at all, was to play&nbsp; the&nbsp; role of an innocent bystander,&nbsp; but that because of his popularity in the neighborhood, being popularly known as a "siga-siga" character, he was requested by the spectators to select the&nbsp; man and the woman to engage or indulge in the actual act of coitus before the spectators; that&nbsp; after making the selection,&nbsp; he did not even care to witness the act but left the scene and returned to it only when he heard a commotion&nbsp; produced by the raid conducted by the police. <br><br>The evidence&nbsp; on his active&nbsp; participation&nbsp; and that&nbsp; he was the manager and one in charge of the show is however ample, even conclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have carefully examined such evidence, and we are&nbsp; satisfied that they&nbsp; fully support the findings&nbsp; of the&nbsp; trial court. Such facts may be&nbsp; briefly stated as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; At the corner of Morga Extension and Camba Extension, Tondo, Manila, was a one story build- ing which judging from the picture exhibited is nothing but a shed, with a floor space of eight&nbsp; by fifteen meters which was mainly&nbsp; used for playing&nbsp; ping-pong.&nbsp; A ping-pong table must have been placed in the center and&nbsp; on two&nbsp; sides were built benches in&nbsp; tiers, so that&nbsp; the&nbsp; spectators seated on them&nbsp; could&nbsp; look&nbsp; down and see the game. On September 13,&nbsp; 1953, however, the building was used for a different purpose.&nbsp; It was to be the scene of what was said to be an exhibition of human "fighting&nbsp; fish", the actual act of&nbsp; coitus&nbsp; or copulation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; must&nbsp; have been advertised by&nbsp; word of&nbsp; mouth; tickets therefor were sold at P3 each, and the show was supposed to begin at 8:00 o'clock in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; About that time of the night, there was already a crowd around the building, but the people were not admitted&nbsp; into it until about an hour later, and the&nbsp; show&nbsp; did not&nbsp; begin until about 9:15.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Manila Police Department&nbsp; must have&nbsp; gotten wind of the affair; it bought tickets and provided several of its members who later attended the&nbsp; show, but in plain&nbsp; clothes, and after the show conducted a raid and&nbsp; made arrests.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the trial, said policemen&nbsp; testified as to&nbsp; what actually&nbsp; took place inside&nbsp; the building.&nbsp; About two civilians who&nbsp; attended the affair gave testimony as to what they saw.<br><br>The customers not provided with tickets&nbsp; actually paid P3 at the entrance to&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Ernesto Reyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also collected tickets.&nbsp;&nbsp; In all, there were&nbsp; about ninety paying customers, while about sixteen were allowed&nbsp; to enter free, presumably friends&nbsp; of the management.&nbsp; Jose Pajardo y Garcia was clearly the manager of the show.&nbsp; He was at the door to see to it that the customers either were provided with&nbsp; tickets&nbsp; or&nbsp; paid&nbsp; P3.00&nbsp; entrance fee.&nbsp;&nbsp; He even asked them from whom they&nbsp; had bought the tickets.&nbsp; He ordered that an army steel bed&nbsp; be placed at the center of the floor, covered with an&nbsp; army blanket&nbsp; and&nbsp; provided with a pillow.&nbsp; Once the spectators, about 106 in&nbsp; number, were crowded inside that small building, the&nbsp; show started. Fajardo&nbsp; evidently&nbsp; to arouse more interest among&nbsp; the customers, asked them to select among two girls present who was to be one of the principal actors.&nbsp; By pointing to or holding his&nbsp; hand over the head of each of the two women one after the other, and judging by the shouts of approval emitted by the spectators, he&nbsp; decided&nbsp; that defendant Marina Padan was the subject of popular approval,&nbsp; and&nbsp; he selected her.&nbsp; After her selection, the other woman named Concha, left.&nbsp; Without much ado, Fajardo selected Cosme Espinosa to be Marina's partner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter, Cosme and Marina proceeded&nbsp; to disrobe&nbsp; while standing around&nbsp; the bed.&nbsp; When completely naked, they turned around to exhibit their bodies&nbsp; to the spectators.&nbsp; Then they&nbsp; indulged in lascivious acts, consisting of petting, kissing, and touching the&nbsp; private parts of each&nbsp; other.&nbsp;&nbsp; When sufficiently aroused, they lay on the bed and proceeded to consummate the act of&nbsp; coitus&nbsp; in three&nbsp; different&nbsp; positions which we deem&nbsp; unnecessary to describe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The four or five witnesses who testified for the Government when asked about their reaction&nbsp; to&nbsp; what&nbsp; they&nbsp; saw, frankly&nbsp; admitted that they were&nbsp; excited&nbsp; beyond description.&nbsp; Then the police who were among the spectators and who were previously provided&nbsp; with a search warrant&nbsp; made the raid,&nbsp; arrested the four defendants herein, and took pictures of Marina and Cosme still&nbsp; naked and&nbsp; of the army bed, which&nbsp; pictures were presented as exhibits during the trial. <br><br>From all this, there can be no&nbsp; doubt that Jose&nbsp; Fajardo y Garcia contrary to what&nbsp; he claims,&nbsp; was&nbsp; the person in charge of the show.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, as&nbsp; found&nbsp; by the trial court and&nbsp; as&nbsp; shown&nbsp; by some of the tickets collected&nbsp; from the spectators, submitted as exhibits, said tickets while bearing on&nbsp; one side printed&nbsp; matter&nbsp; regarding an excursion to Balara to be held&nbsp; on August 30, 1953, from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., sponsored by&nbsp; a certain club,&nbsp; on the other side&nbsp; appears the following&nbsp; typewritten form, reading: <br><blockquote>"P3.00 Admit one <br>PLEASURE SHOW <br>Place:&nbsp;&nbsp; P. Morga Ext. and Camba Ext. <br>Time:&nbsp; 8:00 o'clock sharp", </blockquote>and superimposed on the same is the rubber stamped name "Pepe&nbsp; Fajardo," which defendant&nbsp; Fajardo&nbsp; admits to be his name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering all&nbsp; the above circumstances,&nbsp; we agree with the trial&nbsp; court that Jose Fajardo is the most guilty of the four, for he was the one who&nbsp; conducted the show and presumably derived the&nbsp; most profit or gain from the same. <br><br>As regards the penalty imposed by the trial court on appellant&nbsp; Fajardo, we&nbsp; agree with the Solicitor&nbsp; General that the same&nbsp; is correct, except&nbsp; the&nbsp; minimum&nbsp; thereof which&nbsp; is&nbsp; beyond the legal&nbsp; range,&nbsp; and which should&nbsp; be reduced from one year, one&nbsp; month, and ten days of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision&nbsp; correctional</span> to only six months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor. </span><br><br>With&nbsp; the&nbsp; modification&nbsp; above-mentioned,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision appealed from by Marina Padan and Jose&nbsp; Fajardo&nbsp; are hereby affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against both. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L., Endencia</span>&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ</span>., concur. </div>
