				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition originally filed before&nbsp; this Court seeking to annul certain writ of execution,&nbsp; public auction sale, and&nbsp; certificate of sale covering certain property situated in Manila carried out by the&nbsp; sheriff allegedly&nbsp; contrary to the judgment rendered in the main case,&nbsp; and to recover damages and attorney's fees.<br><br>The petition, as amended, alleges that in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 12772 of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila, entitled Co Chin Ling <i>vs.</i> Anastacio Morelos, for rescission of contract and recovery of rentals, the court, Judge Higinio B. Macadaeg presiding, after due trial, rendered on March 11, 1952 a decision the dispositive part of which reads:&nbsp; "judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendant, Anastacio, Morelos, to pay to the plaintiff, Co Chin Ling, the amount of&nbsp; Pl,023.00 a&nbsp; month from&nbsp; February, 1950 up&nbsp; to&nbsp; the present time.&nbsp; Defendant shall also pay the costs;" that this case was elevated to the&nbsp; Court of Appeals which&nbsp; on February 8, 1957 rendered a confirmatory judgment, that pursuant 4o said order issued by Judge Macadaeg,&nbsp; a writ of&nbsp; execution of the decision was&nbsp; issued&nbsp; to the Sheriff of&nbsp; Manila on July&nbsp; 31, 1957&nbsp; which&nbsp; in substance commanded the latter to "cause to be made the sum of One Thousand and Twenty Three Pesos (P1,023.00) Philippine currency,&nbsp; a month&nbsp; from&nbsp; the—day of&nbsp; February,&nbsp; 1950, to January, 1957,&nbsp; until the date of payment at the rate of—per cent per annum,"&nbsp; that since said writ of&nbsp; execution is different&nbsp; from the decision originally rendered by Judge Macadaeg,&nbsp; as affirmed by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals, which merely ordered&nbsp; Atty. Anastacio Morelos&nbsp; to pay to Co Chin Ling the sum of P1,023.00 a month from February, 1950 up to the present time (March 11, 1952), date of the decision, which covers a period of 2 years&nbsp; and 11&nbsp; days, petitioner filed on August&nbsp; 5, 1957 with Judge&nbsp; Macadaeg a motion for the correction of said writ of execution&nbsp; to make it&nbsp; conform to the decision aforesaid; that on August 21, 1957, respondent Co&nbsp; Chin Ling filed an&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; to said motion for amendment:&nbsp; that on August&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1957, Judge Macadaeg issued an order denying the motion&nbsp; for amendment; that on August 30, 1957, the sheriff of Manila carried out the&nbsp; writ of execution by selling the property at public auction to&nbsp; one Rufino Co Ling for the sum&nbsp; of P120,000.00; that to avoid the loss of his property and the payment of 1% monthly interest on the sum of P120,000.00 which would accrue if the property is not&nbsp; redeemed, petitioner has been forced to redeem the property for the said sum of P120,000.00, plus the corresponding&nbsp; interest, by reason of which he has been unjustly deprived of the sum of P95,072.90&nbsp; which represents the&nbsp; excess over the real amount of the judgment amounting&nbsp; only&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P24,927.10, at&nbsp; the rate of P1,023.00 a month, from February&nbsp; 1950 up to the&nbsp; present time (March 11,&nbsp; 1952). Wherefore, petitioner prays (1) that the writ of&nbsp; execution, public auction&nbsp; sale and certificate&nbsp; of sale executed by the sheriff of Manila as to the excess of P95,072.90 be annulled and that the latter or his co-defendant Co Chin Ling be ordered&nbsp; to deliver to petitioner said&nbsp; sum of P95,072.90; and (2) that respondent judge and sheriff of Manila be ordered to pay petitioner jointly and severally the sum of P5,000.00 as damages and a reasonable amount of attorney's fees, plus the costs of the proceedings.<br><br>Respondents, answering&nbsp; the petition,&nbsp; stated that the writ of execution issued&nbsp; by respondent judge on July 31, 1957 is in accordance with the decision rendered&nbsp; by him on March&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1962, which was affirmed&nbsp; by the Court of Appeals on February 8, 1957; that respondent judge acted on the matter&nbsp; in the exercise of his&nbsp; jurisdiction and did not commit any abuse of discretion; that the&nbsp; sheriff of Manila, in conducting the public auction sale of&nbsp; the property in question, merely complied with the writ of execution issued&nbsp; by the court on July 31, 1957,&nbsp; and that respondents merely acted in accordance with law and the decision rendered&nbsp; in the main&nbsp; case,&nbsp; and&nbsp; therefore no&nbsp; damages could be caused&nbsp; to petitioner,&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; special&nbsp; defense, respondents alleged that on September 3,&nbsp; 1957, petitioner filed in the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Manila a complaint which seeks the same relief prayed for&nbsp; in the&nbsp; present&nbsp; petition (Civil Case No. 33598), and as said action was prior in time and said court&nbsp; has&nbsp; already assumed jurisdiction over the case, the present petition cannot&nbsp; be entertained.&nbsp; They also prayed for damages in the amount of P5,000.00.<br><br>It should be&nbsp; noted that the main issue submitted to the court for determination in the&nbsp; main&nbsp; case refers to the period of the contract of lease embodied in Exhibit B. It was&nbsp; Co Chin Ling's contention that the lease&nbsp; was to run for 8 years from January 31, 1949, date of said exhibit, while&nbsp; petitioner contended that it was only for one year,&nbsp; and this issue was&nbsp; resolved by&nbsp; the trial court in line with respondent's contention.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; other words, the court found that the period of lease&nbsp; agreed upon was for 8 years beginning from said date.&nbsp; This finding was concurred in by the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It also appear that the rentals&nbsp; of the property amounting to P1,023.00 a month from&nbsp; January to December, 1949&nbsp; and January, 1950 had been paid by petitioner, but beginning the&nbsp; month of February, 1950 to&nbsp; the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of the filing of&nbsp; the complaint, December 12, 1950,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to make&nbsp; further payment of the rentals and so this action was brought.&nbsp; It further appears that the main case&nbsp; was decided&nbsp; by the Court of Appeals only on February 8, 1957, and the petition for review was finally acted upon&nbsp; by the Supreme Court on June 18, 1957.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is undoubtedly for&nbsp; these reasons that when respondent judge issued the writ of execution on July 31,&nbsp; 1957, he commanded&nbsp; the&nbsp; sheriff of&nbsp; Manila to collect the rentals of the property&nbsp; from February, 1950 to January,&nbsp; 1957, which completes the period of 8 years constituting&nbsp; the&nbsp; duration of the lease agreed upon.&nbsp; This command&nbsp; is therefore in&nbsp; line with the&nbsp; decision.<br><br>It is&nbsp; true that in its&nbsp; dispositive&nbsp; part petitioner was ordered to pay only "the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; P1,023.00 from February, 1950&nbsp; up&nbsp; to the present time", but this&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be interpreted as to cover merely the period up to the date of the&nbsp; decision&nbsp;&nbsp; (March 11,&nbsp; 1952),&nbsp; for&nbsp; that&nbsp; would&nbsp; be contrary to&nbsp; its <i>ratio&nbsp; decidendi</i>.&nbsp; When a motion for correction was submitted by petitioner in an attempt to have that portion&nbsp; of the decision amended,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same was denied by respondent judge, stating tensely: "the&nbsp; Court finds&nbsp; no valid&nbsp; reason&nbsp; to&nbsp; disturb&nbsp; its order&nbsp; dated July 31,&nbsp; 1957" (Annex "J"). The clear implication&nbsp; from&nbsp; this&nbsp; statement is&nbsp; that the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of execution&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued in&nbsp; accordance with the&nbsp; decision.<br><blockquote>"While&nbsp; the&nbsp; opinion of the court is not part of the judgment, it may, in ease of&nbsp; uncertainty&nbsp; or&nbsp; ambiguity,&nbsp; be&nbsp; referred to for the&nbsp; purpose of construing the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; (D'Arcy <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Staples&nbsp; &amp; Hanford Co.,&nbsp; 161&nbsp; Fed.&nbsp; 733; Pepper<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Donnelly,&nbsp; 8 S. W. 441; Gentry&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Pacific Live&nbsp; Stock Co,,&nbsp; 77&nbsp; Pac.&nbsp; 115;&nbsp; State <i>vs.</i> Bank of Commerce,&nbsp; 36 S.&nbsp; W. 719), particularly&nbsp; where the&nbsp; law&nbsp; requires the judge to state his&nbsp; reasons for the judgment (Avery <i>vs.</i> Police Jury, 35 Am.&nbsp; Dec. 202)&nbsp; as in case of an&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; by an appellate court (Hardy&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Mayhew, 110&nbsp; Pac.&nbsp; 113),&nbsp; or where the judgment itself refers to the opinion in such a&nbsp; way as to make&nbsp; it part of the record.&nbsp; (Legrant <i>vs.</i> Rixey's Adm. 3 S.&nbsp; E. 864)."&nbsp; (Freeman on&nbsp; Judgments, Vol.&nbsp; I,&nbsp; Sec. 76,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 132)<br></blockquote>Wherefore, the&nbsp; petition is denied, without&nbsp; pronouncement as&nbsp; to costs.;<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Labrador, Concepcion,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
