				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioners, dealers in mineral oils and&nbsp; allied products, have filed this action for prohibition seeking to have the respondent Secretary&nbsp; of Labor restrained by&nbsp; this Court from enforcing his Administrative Order WB-6(<i>a</i>), treating a "Wage&nbsp; Board for the Mineral&nbsp; Oil&nbsp; Industry", for the purpose of&nbsp; "fixing&nbsp; a minimum wage for such industry."&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon their&nbsp; petition we&nbsp; issued&nbsp; a preliminary injunction.<br><br>It appears that&nbsp; a report of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Acting&nbsp; Chief of&nbsp; the Wage&nbsp; Administration&nbsp;&nbsp; Service,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; October&nbsp; 3,&nbsp; 1953 (Annex 1, Answer), called the attention&nbsp; of the then acting Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Labor, Aurelio&nbsp; Quitoriano,&nbsp; to the circumstance that "a&nbsp; preliminary investigation of conditions and relevant labor&nbsp; matters in&nbsp; local oil firms in compliance with your instruction"&nbsp; revealed that "there are a total of , four oil companies operating&nbsp; throughout the Philippines, with an aggregate of&nbsp; around 3,000 employees;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the "approximate living cost per family of&nbsp; 4.9 members in the Manila&nbsp; area",&nbsp; based on current price indexes,&nbsp; was&nbsp; estimated at 128 monthly&nbsp; or&nbsp; P5.03 per&nbsp; day;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; adequate diet&nbsp; recommended by&nbsp; the Institute&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nutrition for an average family "requires at least Pa daily", which, added to non food necessities, gave a "minimum adequate standard of&nbsp; living" cost of between P6 and&nbsp; P7 per day; that the latest prevailing&nbsp; wage&nbsp; study&nbsp; of two of the oil firms showed that the&nbsp; employees received P6.40&nbsp; or less per day, and that the&nbsp; reported minimum wage rate was P5.01.&nbsp; The&nbsp; report recommended the&nbsp; appointment&nbsp; of&nbsp; a wage board.&nbsp; Acting upon this report,&nbsp; the Secretary,&nbsp; as recommended, issued Administrative&nbsp; Order No. WB-6(a) setting&nbsp; up a Wage Board for the Oil Industry, pursuant to section 4 (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Minimum Wage&nbsp; Law&nbsp; (Republic Act No. 602), reading as follows:<br><blockquote>"<i>Wage investigation: Appointment of Wage Board.</i>— (<i>a</i>)&nbsp; Tile Secretary of Labor shall have&nbsp; the power, and it shall be his duty upon petition of six or more employees in any industry, to cause an investigation to be made-of the wages being paid to the&nbsp; employees in&nbsp; such industry and&nbsp; their&nbsp; living conditions to ascertain if any substantial number&nbsp; of such employees are receiving&nbsp; wages which are less than&nbsp; sufficient to maintain them. in health, efficiency and general well-being.&nbsp; If after such investigation&nbsp; the .Secretary of Labor is of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that any substantial number of such employees&nbsp; are&nbsp; receiving such wages, he&nbsp; shall appoint&nbsp; a&nbsp; Wage Board to fix a minimum -wage for such industry."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; contend that&nbsp; said&nbsp; Order&nbsp; WB-6(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; is null&nbsp; and void, because:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) No&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; was conducted as required by law prior to the&nbsp; appointment of;a wage board;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) The Secretary of Labor did not render an opinion that&nbsp; a&nbsp; substantial number of oil industry employees&nbsp; received&nbsp; wage&nbsp; "less than sufficient to&nbsp; maintain&nbsp; them&nbsp; in health,&nbsp; efficiency and general well-being."<br><br>(<i>c</i>) That&nbsp; there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; proof before the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; to justify&nbsp; such&nbsp; an opinion;<br><br>(<i>d</i>) That&nbsp; employers&nbsp; were not heard before the&nbsp; wage board was appointed.<br><br>We find the objections to be without&nbsp; merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The report of the Chief of the Wage Service sufficiently shows, that the Secretary directed that the investigation required by law be&nbsp; made; and the facts&nbsp; disclosed in the report indicate that the average minimum wage in the oil industry was&nbsp; below&nbsp; the&nbsp; estimated requirements&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; adequate standard of living. That the Secretary thereupon reached the, conclusion that&nbsp; such wage were less than required for the health,&nbsp; efficiency and general well-being&nbsp; of&nbsp; the workers- affected is&nbsp; apparent&nbsp; from&nbsp; his&nbsp; creation&nbsp; of the Wage Board. <br><br>It is&nbsp; to be&nbsp; noted that the law does not prescribe that the investigation be&nbsp; made by the Secretary himself; nor attempt to&nbsp; specify what precise facts must be disclosed by his&nbsp; investigation,&nbsp; and for&nbsp; a good reason.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; the Wage Board that will conduct the&nbsp; real&nbsp; inquiry into the facts&nbsp; under -section 5(<i>b</i>) of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Minimum Wage law, and for that purpose the board is empowered to summon witnesses and call for such additional information as it may require.&nbsp; In addition, after the Wage Board has filed its report and recommendations, section&nbsp; 6 (<i>a</i>) of the&nbsp; law requires the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; to&nbsp; notify&nbsp; the interested&nbsp; parties and&nbsp; then hold public&nbsp; hearings thereon before&nbsp; issuing&nbsp; a final wage&nbsp; order.<br><br>Manifestly,&nbsp; the investigation preceding the appointment of a Wage&nbsp; Board is not intended to&nbsp; be final, but merely preliminary and sufficient for what is termed "a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span>&nbsp; case"; otherwise, the fact finding by the Board and the public hearings upon its report would be superfluous repetitions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Courts should not interfere&nbsp; with the preliminary opinion of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary of the effect that the facts before him justify the constitution of the Wage Board,&nbsp; at least&nbsp; in the absence of an abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp; discretion, that here has not been shown to exist.<br><br>It is&nbsp; equally obvious that section 4 (a)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Minimum Wage Act,&nbsp; in requiring&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Secretary&nbsp; should be "<i>of the opinion"</i>&nbsp; that a substantial number of employees in a given industry are receiving wages insufficient to maintain them&nbsp; "in health efficiency&nbsp; and&nbsp; general well-being", does not demand more than a reasonable belief&nbsp; or&nbsp; conviction of the Secretary that such undesirable conditions exist; much less does it prescribe that the Secretary should express or&nbsp; issued written&nbsp; statement of his opinion.&nbsp; Apparently&nbsp; petitioners have unwarrantedly assumed the requirement that the Secretary of&nbsp; Labor should be&nbsp; "of the opinion"&nbsp; that&nbsp; a Wage Board&nbsp; is&nbsp; warranted,&nbsp; to be a&nbsp; condition that he should "render an&nbsp; opinion".<br><br>Likewise apparent is the fact that the law contemplates no hearing or intervention of the employers&nbsp; affected in the investigation prior to the constitution of a Wage Board, precisely because it is&nbsp; a mere preliminary&nbsp; step&nbsp; for the full inquiry that will take&nbsp; place afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp; The protection of the employers'&nbsp; interests&nbsp; is assured by the&nbsp; fact that the Wage Board is to&nbsp; be composed of tyo representatives&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; employers,, two of the employees,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a Chairman representing the public (section 5 (<i>a</i>) Minimum Wage Act); and by the express provisions of section&nbsp; 6 (<i>a</i>) that the public hearings to be conducted by the Secretary of Labor on the Board's report "shall be consonant&nbsp; with due process of law," and upon notice to interested parties. No real&nbsp; injury was therefore caused to the petitioners herein by not&nbsp; giving them a hearing before setting up the Wage Board&nbsp; in question;&nbsp; and this in itself is sufficient ' ground for dismissing the petition (cf. Bautista <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Municipal Council of Mandaluyong,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">supra,&nbsp;</span> p. 409; Race Horse Trainers Association <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> De la Fuente, 88 Phil.,&nbsp; 60).<br><br>That the petitioners and their employees&nbsp; have&nbsp; entered . into collective&nbsp; bargaining agreements can&nbsp; not bar&nbsp; the setting up of Wage Boards under the Minimum Wage Law, the purposes&nbsp; of the latter being, different.&nbsp; We can not ignore the fact that economic pressures may induce collective agreements that do not fully meet the minimum socially desirable.<br><br>The petition is&nbsp; dismissed and the preliminary injunction dissolved. Costs against the petitioner.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, </i>and <i>Endeneia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
