				<H3>THE BACOLOD-MURCIA PLANTERS' ASSOCIATION, INC., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE CHUA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance 
of Occidental Negros dismissing the above-entitled case without costs. The 
appeal is directed not against the dismissal of the case, but solely against the 
court's refusal to adjudge costs.
<p align="justify">It appears that the said case was initiated with a complaint 
filed by the Bacolod-Murcia Planters' Association, Inc., as sole plaintiff, for 
the recovery of P2,373 which defendant had deducted from the purchase price of 
sugar alleged to have been bought by him from plaintiff, the deduction having 
been made on the supposition that defendant was to pay the export duties levied 
by the city of Bacolod on said sugar, but which export duties were later annuled 
by the courts with the result that the amount paid therefor by defendant was 
supposedly refunded to him later. On the strength of said complaint and the 
allegation that defendant was about to dispose of his properties for the purpose 
of defrauding his creditors, plaintiff was able to garnish defendants deposit in 
the Philippine National Bank to the extent necessary to insure payment of 
plaintiff's claim. Alleging that plaintiff had no cause of action against him 
because the sugar mentioned in the complaint was bought by him directly from the 
individual planters and not from the plaintiff association, defendant moved for 
the lifting of the garnishment as well as for the dismissal of the complaint; 
but as a counter-move counsel for plaintiff filed an amended complaint joining 
the individual planters as plaintiffs and reducing the total claim against 
defendant, including that of the planters' association, to P1,121.98. In view of 
the facts revealed by the amended complaint, the court' lifted the garnishment. 
The court also refused to admit the amended complaint on the ground that, while 
the total amount sought to be recovered came under the jurisdiction of the Court 
of First Instance, the individual claims of the planters and of the association, 
none of which amounted to P200, were each within the exclusive original 
jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court. Thereafter, on motion of the 
defendant, and with the conformity of counsel for plaintiff, the court ordered 
the dismissal of the case but without costs. A motion to reconsider the said 
order having been denied, defendant has appealed to this Court.</p>
<p align="justify">The only question presented is whether, on the facts above 
stated, the lower court committed a reversible error when it denied costs to 
defendant.</p>
<p align="justify">Although costs are generally allowed to the prevailing party as 
a matter of course, courts are nevertheless empowered, for special reasons, "to 
adjudge that either party shall pay the costs of an action or that the same be 
divided, as may be equitable." (Sec. 1, Rule 31, Rules of Court.) In practice 
this power has been translated into the proposition that "payment of costs is a 
matter that rests entirely upon the discretion of courts." (III Moran, Rules of 
Court, 2nd Rev. ed., p. 845, citing Roque et al. vs. Vda. de Cogan, 40 Off. Gaz. 
[10th Supp.], 55.) An appeal would hardly lie whose purpose is to interfere with 
that discretion. And there is high authority to support this view for in the 
case of Newton vs. Consolidated Gas Co., 265 U. S., 78, the Supreme Court of the 
United States said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The rule forbidding appeals from decrees for the costs only is 
easily deducible from the discretion vested in thd trial court in fixing them, 
and the better opportunity of that court to exercise that discretion from its 
greater intimacy with details of the pleadings, hearings, and orders in the 
case. * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Plaintiff contends that he should have been awarded costs for 
having been subjected to a vexatious suit and to an unjust garnishment of his 
bank deposit through a misrepresentation of facts as shown by the difference 
between the original and the amended complaint. The contention lacks force when 
viewed in the light of what really took place.</p>
<p align="justify">The reason for the lower court's action in denying costs to 
plaintiff is stated in its order of August 16, 1947, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Encontrando, sin embargo, que el auto de sobreseimiento de 
esta causa, cuya reconsideracion se pide, se ha dictado previa la conformidad de 
la entidad demandante dada en estrados, lo cual, a juicio del Juzgado, es una 
razon especial para que no se hiciera ningun pronunciamiento especial en cuanto 
a las costas, se deniega la mocion de reconsideracion."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In addition, the pleadings disclose a valid cause of action 
against the defendant, who, on the facts alleged, is legally under obligation to 
refund certain sums to which he is not entitled. A mistake was, however, 
committed when counsel at first asserted the cause of action in favor of the 
planters' association alone without naming the individual planters as 
co-plaintiffs or pleading facts sufficient to show that the action was being 
brought in the name of all the real parties in interest. In the circumstances, 
we are not disposed to hold that the lower court committed an error or abused 
its discretion in refusing a judgment for costs. On the contrary, some members 
of this Court even consider the appeal as frivolous and are for imposing double 
costs on the appellant. The majority, however, are of the opinion that the ends 
of justice will be sufficiently served if ordinary costs are imposed.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, with costs 
against the appellant.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Bengzon, Padilla, 
Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
