				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-2752, December 29, 1949</h4>
				<H3>URBANO OLAVARIO ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. JUAN T. VILLANUEVA, RESPONDENT
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court of 
Industrial Relations reversing the decision of the Tenancy Law Enforcement 
Division of the Department of Justice and authorizing and sanctioning the 
ejectment or dismissal of the now petitioners and appellants from their 
landholdings. For answer the respondent alleges, besides several defenses on the 
merits, that the appeal was not "perfected within the fifteen-day period 
provided for by law," and asks for its dismissal.
<p align="justify">A perusal of the record of the Court of Industrial Relations 
and of the appellants' memorandum shows that copy; of the appealed decision was 
received by the petitioners on November 18, 1948; that a motion for 
reconsideration was mailed on November 18, 1948; that copy of the resolution of 
the Court of Industrial Relations denying that motion was delivered to the 
petitioners on January 18, 1949; that notice of appeal was filed on January 21, 
1949; and that the petition for certiorari, docketed in the Supreme Court on 
February 1, 1949, was according to the petitioners, registered for mailing on 
January 29, 1949. Computation of the period on the basis of the material dates 
gives this result: Between January 18, when the attorney for the petitioners was 
notified of the adverse resolution on his motion for reconsideration, and 
January 29, when counsel put his petition for certiorari in the mail, there was 
a complete interval of ten days. In other words, excluding January 18, the 
application for certiorari was mailed on the eleventh day, well beyond his ten 
days to appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">The applicable provision is not section 1 of Rule 44 of the 
Rules of Court, as both parties seem to believe, but Commonwealth Act No. 559, 
amending Commonwealth Act No. 103 and passed after the promulgation of the Rules 
of Court, which Act provides that petition to review on certiorari a decision of 
the Court of Industrial Relations shall be filed within ten days from notice of 
the decision. (Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. vs. Philippine Labor Union, 71 
Phil., 578.)</p>
<p align="justify">Without therefore deciding any of the questions on the merits 
raised in the pleadings, the petition for certiorari should be and is dismissed, 
with costs against the petitioners.</p> <em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, 
Reyes,</em> and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur.</div>
