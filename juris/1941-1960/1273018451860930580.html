				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Appellants' complaint was filed on June 8, 1946, to collect sums of money 
based on commitments made by defendant in a document executed on July 21, 1934t 
that is, 11 years, 10 months and 17 days before the filing of the complaint.<p>Invoking Sections 43 and 44 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 1 
<em>(e)</em> of Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, defendant moved to dismiss the 
complaint oh the ground that plaintiffs cause of action is barred by the statute 
of limitations.</p>
<p>On August 30, 1946, the lower court held that plaintiffs' cause of action 
had prescribed and dismissed the complaint, with costs against plaintiffs, who 
appealed.</p>
<p>Appellants seek our support in favor of the theory that war suspends the 
running of the statute of limitations. If the theory is upheld, by deducting the 
more than three years' duration of the war, there would be less than ten years 
from ;the time of the execution of the document to the filing of, the complaint, 
hence, the complaint should not have been dismissed.</p>
<p>No showing has been made why vie should reverse the doctrine that the statute 
of limitations is suspended by war, rebellion, or Insurrection, "when the 
regular course of justice is Interrupted to such an extent that courts cannot be 
kept open." (España vs. Lucido, &amp; Phil. 419.) The reason of the doctrine is 
obvious. When there are no competent courts to take cognizance of an action, 
failure to file it cannot be held against a plaintiff. <em>Nemo tenetur</em> 
<em>ad impossible</em> Plaintiff having been precluded without his fault from 
filing his complaint, it is evident that there is no sense of justice in not 
suspending the statute in his case.</p>
<p>In the present case the lower court took judicial notice of the fact, not 
disputed by appellants, that in the uninvaded parts of Iloilo, where the 
majority of the municipalities are situated, the Commonwealth courts continued 
functioning regularly for the duration of the war, while in the occupied areas 
there were courts established by the Philippine Excecutive Commission and the 
occupation Republic of the Philippines. There was no material obstacle to 
plaintiffs' filing their complaint before the expiration of the period 
prescribed by the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>The appealed order is affirmed, with costs against appellants.</p>
<p><em>Paras, Acting C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla</em>, and 
<em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
