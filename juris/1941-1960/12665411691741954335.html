				G.R. No. L-2022, May 26, 1949</h4>

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by certiorari against a decision of the Court 
of Appeals promulgated on January 29, 1948, affirming with some modification a 
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila ordering petitioner to vacate 
the premises in question, located at the corner of Ta nduay and Tuberias 
Streets, Manila.
<p align="justify">The decision of the Court of First Instance, rendered on August 
27, 1946, ordered the defendants to vacate the premises and to pay the 
plaintiffs the amount of P60 per month beginning January 1, 1942, the case 
having been initiated in said court with an action filed on March 16, 1943.</p>
<p align="justify">On July 11, 1940, plaintiffs demanded from defendants to vacate 
the premises and to pay a monthly rental of P150 beginning July, 1940. 
Defendants wrote plaintiffs refusing to agree to the increase of the monthly 
rent from P60 to P150. Plaintiffs continued collecting rents at the rate of P60 
a month until October 25, 1940, when plaintiffs again demanded from defendants 
to vacate the premises and insisted on the monthly rent of P150.</p>
<p align="justify">Defendants raised the question of jurisdiction of the trial 
court, alleging that the case was a simple one of ejectment falling within the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the municipal court of Manila. The question was 
dismissed by the Court of First Instance of Manila, and was agian raised before 
the Court of Appeals, which disposed of it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Now, going to the errors assigned by the 
defendants-appellants, and starting with the first one, we cannot agree to the 
contention of the said defendants that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to 
try and decide this case. It is true that the question involves the ejectment of 
tenants, and the recovery by the landlord of the rentals thereof. According to 
law, within one year form the time that premises unlder lease are dtained 
unlawfully the action should be brought in the Municipal Court, and, thereafter, 
it has to be brought in the Court of First Instance for the action would then be 
in the nature of an <i>accion publiciana</i> for the recovery of possession. It 
will be remembered that the defendants-appellants were required to vacate the 
premises since July, 1940, and, therefore, the demand was more than once 
repeated. The defendants neither vacated the premises nor paid the amount of 
P150 demanded by the owners as rentals. From that time, they were in default and 
were detaining the premises unlawfully. The present action was brought only on 
March 16, 1943, <i>i.e.</i>, more than two years after the commencement of the 
unlawful detainer. It is clear that the municipal court would not have 
jurisdiction and that the action could be brought only in the Court of First 
Instance."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We do not see valid reason to reverse the action taken by the 
Court of Appeals. The action filed on March 16, 1943, was intended not only to 
eject petitioners but also to collect from them rents at the rate of P150 a 
month form July 1940, including damages in the amount of P5,000 based on the 
expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in the preparation of the plan and 
specifications for the construction of an eighteen-door apartment on the lot, as 
well as the profits they expected to make form the rents, and it is clear from 
the plaintiffs' action and from the facts as found by the Court of Appeals that 
the illegal possession by defendants of the premises in question started from 
July 1, 1940, or, at least, from October 25, 1940, as the record will show, when 
plaintiffs again demanded from defendants to vacate the premises and insisted on 
the payment of a monthly rentals of P150, that is to say, much more than two 
years before the action was initiated in the Court of First Instance of Manila. 
The jurisdiction of the Municipal Court of Manila over forcible entry and 
detainer cases is circumscribed to illegal possessions not exceeding one year 
before the action is initiated. Beyond that period, the jurisdiction to 
entertain an ejectment case belongs to the Court of First Instance.</p>

<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p> Paras, J.:<p></p>

Cananay vs. Sarmiento, G. R. No. L-1246.</p></div>
