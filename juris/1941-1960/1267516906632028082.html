				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Under date of February 8, 1952 Celedonio Santos Mariano Geronimo, Fabian 
Geronimo, Domingo Valenzuela and Pantaleon Valenzuela, hereinafter to be 
referredto as petitioners, filed a complaint (case No. 3625-R)In the Court of 
Industrial Relations against Fidel Makapugay and Antonio Paulino, in substance 
alleging that the petitioners have been for almost twenty-five years the tenante 
of Fidel Makapugay on the latter's rice land located in Tenejeros, Pulilan, 
Bulacan; that they have been in peaceful possession and cultivation of said land 
until February 1, 1952, when Antonio Paulino, allegedly acting as lessee of 
Fidel Makapugay, tried and in fact was able to enter into the land; that the 
petitioners cannot be summarily ejected in. the absence of any ground therefor 
in accordance with the Tenancy Law. The petitioners prayed that Fidel Makapugay 
and Antonio Paulino be ordered to respect their possession as tenants and that 
an injunction be issued restraining Fidel Makapugay and Antonio Paulino from 
entering the land in the meantime. On February 10,. 1952, Presiding Judge 
Arsenio C. Roldan of the Court of Industrial Relations issued an order 
prohibiting Fidel Makapugay and Antonio Paulino from interfering with the 
possession of the petitioners pending final disposition of the cage on the 
merits.
<p>Under date February 14, 1952, Fidel Makapugay and Anionio Paulino filed an 
answer in substance alleging that the petitioners were ejected from the land, 
because they committed certain acts of unfaithfulness and breach of trust in 
connection with their tenancy and failed to accomplish the necessary farm work 
to insure a good harvest; and that the petitioners' ejectment was in accordance 
with the provisions of Act No. 4054 as amended.</p>
<p>Under date February 21, 1952, Fidel Makapugay filed a complaint (case No. 
3715-R) in the Court Of Industrial Relations against the petitioners, alleging 
in substance that the latter, who are tenants of Fidel Makapugay on the land 
situated in Tenejeros, Pulilan, Bulacan, had committed certain misconduct and 
willful disobedience to the lawful orders of Fidel Makapugay; that the 
petitioners had failed to comply with their obligation, under Act No. 4054, as 
amended, and under their contract of tenancy; that as a consequence the harvest 
from the land was reduced to an unbelievable amount compared with the harvest 
during previous agricultural years. Fidel Makapugay prayed that the case beheard 
jointly with the complaint filed by the petitioners, case No. 3625-R, and that 
after due hearing the petitioners be ordered ejected.</p>
<p>Under date of April 22, 1952, the petitioners filed an answer in case No. 
3715-R, in substance alleging that they have no knowledge of any disobedience on 
their part to lawful orders of Fidel Makapugay, or of any failure to comply with 
their obligations as tenants under Act No. 4054, as amended; that if the harvest 
was ever reduced, it was for reasons beyond petitioners' control; and that the 
parties in the two cases are not identical and the issues, though similar, are 
not the same.</p>
<p>Under date of August 13, 1952, after a joint trial, Presiding Judge Arsenio 
C. Roldan of the Court of Industrial Relations rendered the following 
decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Case No. 3625-R, petitioners Celedonio Santos, Pantaleon Valenzuela, 
Domingo Valenzuela, Mariano Geronimo, Fabian Geronimo claimed that they are 
tenants of respondent Fidel Makapugay, and that they are being ejected without 
just and reasonable cause, from their respective landholdings situated at 
Tenejeros, Pulilan, Bulacan.</p>
<p>"The respondent in his answer alleged that, the petitioners are being ejected 
due to the latters' negligence and non-performance of their duties in connection 
with the necessary farm work which will insure a good harvest.</p>
<p>"In Case No. 3715-E, landlord Fidel Makapugay averred that the hereinabove 
tenants have committed acts of misconduct or willful disobedience to his lawful 
orders and that said tenants failed to comply with their obligations in 
accordance with Act 4054, as amended.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, the respondent tenants denied all the allegations in the 
complaint and maintained that although the issues in both case are similar, they 
are net the same.</p>
<p>"An interlocutory order was issued by this Court dated February 14, 1952. 
maintaining the <em>status quo</em> of the litigating parties in the 
landholdings in question pending the hearing and final disposition of the,case 
on its merits.</p>
<p>"In view of the identity of the parties and subject matter, these cases were 
heard jointly and presently consolidated for purposes of decision.</p>
<p>"From the evidence of record, we find fully established the following 
facts:</p>
<p>"There exist tenancy relations between the landlord and the tenants; the 
lands in question are irrigated first-class lands the crops have been scarce 
considering that these lands are first-class and irrigated; the dikes were 
broken and, at least, dilapidated and too low to hold water necessary for the 
cultivation of the seedlings, which may also be the cause of the poor harvest 
just mentioned; in the landholdings of Pantaleon Valenzuela, Mariano Geronimo 
and Celedonio Santos, the said tenants constructed in their landholdings ponds 
which they use for fishing purposes against the will of the landlord and in 
disobedience to the latter's order; in the landholdings of Mariano Geronimo, 
Celedonio Santos, and Fabian Geronimo, portions thereof were not cultivated and 
so were not planted with palay; Celedonio Santos and Mariano Geronimo do not own 
carabaos and have to resort to 'Palusong' system in the cultivation of their 
landholdings; the tenants planted also rice of the variety called 'malagkit' but 
no share was given to the landlord. </p>
<p>"The question at issue is whether or not there is sufficient cause or causes 
for landlord Fidel Makapugay to eject the herein tenants. </p>
<p>"Premises considered, the Court is of the opinion, and so holds, that the 
herein tenants have been grossly negligent in the performance of their duties to 
the prejudice of the harvest of the entire landholding in question and have 
commited acts which constitute just cause for their ejectment, in accordance 
with sub-paragraph 2 section 19, Act 4054 as amended. </p>
<p>"In view of the foregoing, landlord Fidel Makapugay is hereby authorized to 
dispossess his tenants, Celedonio Santos, Pantaleon Valenzuela, Domingo 
Valenzuela, Mariano Geronimo, and Fabian Geronimo from the landholdings situated 
at Tenejeros, Pulilan, Bulacan, subject to the provisions of sections 21 and 22 
of Act 4054 as amended.</p>
<p>"So ordered." </p></blockquote>
<p>On August 21, 1952, the petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration based 
on the grounds that the decision was not supported by the evidence and is 
contrary to law, and that irregularities were committed or took place during the 
trial, prejudicial to petitioners' rights. Before this motion for 
reconsideration could be acted upon by the Court of Industrial Relations <em>in 
banc</em>, a joint motion dated December 18, 1952, signed by Fidel Makapugay on 
the one hand and lsmael Gali, attorney for petitioners, on the other, was flied 
in the Court of Industrial Relations, praying that movants be allowed to 
withdraw their respective suits, on the ground that, with respect to the harvest 
during the 1952-1953 agricultural year, they arrived at the following 
stipulations, "<em>a</em>. That the sharing shall be on the 70-30 basis; 
<em>b</em>. That the landlord's share of the seedlings sha11 be reimbursed or 
returned; <em>c</em>. That the landlord shall have at his option his 
representative in the liquidation of the harvest who shall take delivery of his 
share; and d. That all the expenses in cultivation shall be in equity and for 
the account of tenants in accordance with law." In the motion it was also prayed 
that the foregoing stipulations be sanctioned by the court. Under date of 
January 8, 1953, Presiding Judge Roldan lssued a resolutlon providing that: "if 
the intention of the parties is to withdraw all suits including the motion for 
reconsideration, this Court has no objection and, therefore, approves the 
withdrawal of the motion for reconsideration," </p>
<p>Under date of, January 20, 1953, the petitioners filed a motion for 
clarification, in essence alleging that it was the primary intention of the 
parties in filing the joint motion of December 18, 1952, to have an amicable 
settlement and to withdraw the two suits, namely, cases Nos. 3625-R.and 3715-R. 
Upon the other hand, Fidel Makapugay filed a motion dated February 13, 1953, 
alleging that he signed the joint motion in the belief that its only purpose was 
to withdraw petitioners' motion for reconsideration in return for the agreement 
of Fidel Makapugay to divide the current harvest on a 70-30 sharing basis; that 
he would have not signed the motion if the result would be the withdrawal of his 
suit against the petitioners wherein he had already obtained a favorable 
judgment; and praying that the parties be placed in <em>status quo</em>.</p>
<p>The, Presiding Judge Roldan issued a resolution dated March 27, 1958, the 
dispositive part of which 'reads as follows; "Evidently, the Court in approving 
the resolution allowing the withdrawal of the motion for reconsideration of 
August 20, 1952, which was pending hearing in the Court <em>in banc</em>, did so 
without including the withdrawal of the suits because they had already been 
decided by the said Court. If it is pretended that the joint motion includes the 
withdrawal of the suits, this Court hereby denies said joint motion but sets 
aside the resolution of January 8, 1953 and reinstates the motion for 
reconsideration of August 20, 1952 in the calendar of the Court." On October 24, 
1953, the Court of Industrial Relations <em>in banc</em> promulgated a 
resolution denying the petitioners' motion for reconsideration, on the ground 
that after a careful perusal of the evidence as well as the oral and written 
arguments of both parties, it failed to find sufficient justification for 
altering or modifying the decision of Presiding Judge Roldan dated August 13, 
1952. 'Hence the petitioners instituted the present petition for review on 
certiorari.</p>
<p>One of the grounds invoked by the petitioners herein is that the lower court 
rendered its decision, based on the evidence presented by only one party, the 
landlord, while petitioners' evidence was not given weight. It is needless to 
state that under the rules and repeated decisions of this Court, findings of 
fact of the Court of Industrial Relations in an appeal by certiorari are 
conclusive and cannot therefore be reviewed. While we are not insensitive to the 
situation of the petitioners who have held the land in question for many years 
under tenancy, we are constrained to accept the facts as found by the Court of 
Industrial Relations, considering that we have to apply the law with impartial 
uniformity. <br><br>The petitioners have pointed out certain irregularities 
which allegedly prejudiced their rights. For instance they claim that (1) their 
motion for a bill of particulars in case No. 3715-R Was denied; (2) the two 
cases were tried and decided jointly although they are not identical, and the 
decision was rendered after the trial of only one case; (3) without authority 
from the Court of Industrial Relations Atty. Miguel Valera replaced Atty. 
Sontuico as commissioner to hear the cases; (4) the Court of Industrial 
Relations did not give due course to petitioners' motion for ocular inspection; 
(5) the hearing on petitioners' motion for reconsideration by the court in bane 
was suspended until the missing portions of the records were found; (6) the 
court failed to approve the amicable settlement and withdrawal of two suits as 
prayed for in the joint motion dated December 18, 1952; and (7) the petitioners 
were not able to cross-examine one of the witnesses for the landlord because 
commissioner Valera took over the hearing in the afternoon of June 20, 1952, and 
prevented the petitioners from cross-examining said witness.</p>
<p>Even if these irregularities were actually committed, we are unable to hold 
that petitioners' substantial rights were prejudiced. It is noteworthy that in 
the hearing held before commissioner Valera in the afternoon of June 20, 1952, 
the parties, through their respective attorneys, entered into the following 
stipulations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Commissioner</p>
<p>"All right, we will now proceed.</p>
<p>"Attys. Lindayag and Gali jointly manifesting ...</p>
<p>"In order to abbreviate the proceedings "of this case, counsel of both 
parties have agreed on the following stipulations of facts, to wit:<br>"1. That 
the petitioner is.intending to lease and/or sell the landholding in 
question,<br>"2. The <em>pilapiles</em> are now repaired,<br>"3. That Pantaleon 
Valenzuela and Celedonio Santos, if presented, would testify that they did not 
plant <em>malagkit</em> in the last agricultural year, and<br>"4. That the balon 
occupies a small portion of the landholding of Celedonio Santos and Pantaleon 
Valenzuela and that it is customary to have this <em>balons</em> in that 
place,<br>"5. That they would deny that a portion of their landholding were left 
uncultivated.</p>
<p>"Atty. Gali</p>
<p>"I am submitting the map representing a rough sketch of the landholding in 
question and I request that it be marked as Exh. 'A' for the tenants.</p>
<p>"The Commissioner</p>
<p>"Let that map be marked as Bxh. 'A' for the tenants.</p>
<p>"Special Deputy</p>
<p>"Mark the map as directed, Exh. 'A' for the tenants.</p>
<p>"Atty Gali</p>
<p>"I am manifesting that the lower portion of the landholding in question are 
already planted and the seedling are already grown and ready for 
transplanting.<br>"In this connection, I pray that the. Court would send a 
Commissioner to verify this statement by going to the premises.</p>
<p>"The Commissioser</p>
<p>"The Court shall, if necessary so as to be guided accordingly in the proper 
determination of the case, by moto proprio, send a representative to go to the 
premises to verify that statement of counsel for the tenants.</p>
<p>"Atty. Gali</p>
<p>"With the presentation of Exh. 'A' for the tenants, I rest my case.</p>
<p>"The Commissioner</p>
<p>"Won't counsels for parties file their respective memorandum?</p>
<p>"Attys. Gali and Lindayag jointly manifesting ...</p>
<p>"We will file, Mr. Commissioner.</p>
<p>"The Commissioner</p>
<p>"All right, counsels are hereby given 5 days upon receipt of their copies of 
the transcript of this case within which to file their respective memorandum 
simultaneously."</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of said stipulations, the petitioners cannot now complain about most, 
if not all, of the irregularities above mentioned, because proper reservations 
or objections could and should have been made during the aforesaid hearing. At 
any rate, under section 20. of Commonwealth Act No. 103, In the hearing, 
investigation and determination of any question or controversy and in exercising 
any duties and power under this Act, the Court shall act according to justice 
and equity and substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities 
or legal forms and shall not be bound by any technical rules of legal evidence 
but may inform its mind in'such manner as it may deem just and equitable."</p>
<p>With reference to the joint motion dated December 18, 1952,.the motion for 
clarification dated January 20, 1953, filed by for petitioners, and the motion 
dated February 13, 1953, filed by attorney for Fidel Makapugay, we are of the 
opinion that the action of the Court of Industrial Relations, first, in issuing 
the resolution of January 8, 1953 and, secondly, in promulgating the resolution 
March 27, 1953, is proper specially in view of the disavowal by Fidel Makapugay 
of the recital or primary object of the joint motion.</p>
<p>The joint trial of and joint decision in the two cases are likewise 
appropriate, since the mam issue in both suits same namely, whether the 
petitioners are guilty of such acts or omissions as would be sufficient to 
warrant their ejectment under Act No. 4054, as amended.</p>
<p>The suspension of the hearing on petitioners' motion for reconsideration on 
September 22, 1952, when it was discovered that a portion of the transcript was 
missing, far from being criticized, was the most logical thing for the court to 
do. Indeed, no sooner had the misplaced transcript been located than the 
consideration of petitioners' motion for reconsideration was resumed on October 
1, 1952, and court resolved the same on October 24, 1952.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision complained of is affirmed. So ordered without 
costs.</p>
