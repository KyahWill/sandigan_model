				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JULIAN ORAZA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, the appellant 
Julian Oraza was prosecuted for serious physical injuries for inflicting upon 
the offended party Hilario Sison injuries which required medical attendance and 
took sixty days to heal, and which, during the aforesaid period of time, 
incapacitated said offended party for the work in which he was theretofore 
habitually engaged. When first arraigned, he pleaded not guilty, but later, with 
leave of the court, this plea was withdrawn and, upon rearraignment, he pleaded 
guilty. After said second plea, and with the permission of the court, he 
proceeded to prove by his testimony that he had voluntarily surrendered to the 
authorities after the commission of the crime and that he was a little bit drunk 
at the time he committed it, his drunkenness not being habitual. The lower 
court, considering his plea of guilty as well as the other mitigating 
circumstances, sentenced him to four months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> and to pay the 
costs, at the same time reserving to the offended party the right to claim 
damages in a separate civil action. From this decision, the defendant appealed, 
alleging that the penalty is excessive, and that, furthermore, the lower court 
erred in making the reservation in favor of the offended party to claim damages 
in a separate civil action, inasmuch as nowhere in the complaint is any claim 
for damages made, aside from the fact that the reservation made by the offended 
party was made after the defendant had pleaded guilty to the information.
<p align="justify">As regards the penalty imposed by the lower court, the same is 
clearly not excessive. Counsel for the appellant, in his brief, admits that the 
penalty of four months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> is within the range provided by law, 
only that, considering the number of mitigating circumstances, namely three, and 
that the injuries inflicted upon the offended party healed in sixty days and not 
in ninety days, which is the maximum period mentioned in article 263, paragraph 
4, of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty imposed should have been only two 
months, which is the minimum of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by 
law. This contention we find to be unfounded. There is no warrant or reason for 
making any fine distinctions based on the period within which injuries inflicted 
upon an offended party may have actually healed,—that is, whether they are 
within the minimum, medium or maximum period, or number of days mentioned in the 
article of the Revised Penal Code involved. In the present case it is sufficient 
that the same came under the provisions of article 263, paragraph 4, of the code 
inasmuch as the period of incapacity and healing of the injuries was more than 
thirty days but not more than ninety days.</p>
<p align="justify">Once the penalty next lower to that prescribed by law is 
applied because of the presence of two or more mitigating circumstances, the 
period,—whether it be in the maximum, medium or minimum—should and must be 
left entirely to the discretion of the trial court, according to the very terms 
of article 64, paragraph 5, of the Revised Penal Code, which provides that "the 
court shall impose the penalty next lower to that prescribed by law, <span style="font-style: italic;">in the 
period that it may deem applicable, according to the number and nature of such 
circumstances</span>." (<span style="font-style: italic;">5 Viada, 5th ed., p. 577</span>.) </p>
<p align="justify">As to the second point regarding the reservation in favor of 
the offended party of the right to claim damages in a separate civil action, 
there is no need to allege in the information that the offended party had 
suffered damages and intends to make a claim for them. Every person criminally 
liable for a felony is also civilly liable. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Art. 100, Revised Penal Code</span>.) So, 
when a complaint or information is filed, even without any allegation of damages 
and the intention to prove and claim them, it is to be understood that the 
offender is liable for them, and that, the offended party has the right to prove 
and claim for them, unless a waiver of the reservation is made. (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. 
Celorico, G. R. No. 45738</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">8 Lawyers' Journal, p. 403; United States vs. Heery, 
25 Phil., 600</span>.) As a matter of fact, the record in the present case shows that 
the reservation was made by the court in favor of the offended party previous to 
the plea of guilty by the appellant. (<span style="font-style: italic;">See page 2, t. s. n. Posadas</span>.)</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is hereby 
affirmed, with costs.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon,
