				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff instituted this action&nbsp; in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Iloilo to&nbsp; have Resolution No. 65 of the&nbsp; Board of Directors of the&nbsp; La Paz Ice Plant and Cold Storage Co., Inc.,&nbsp; removing him from&nbsp; his position of manager of said corporation declared&nbsp; null and void and to recover damages incident thereto. The action is&nbsp; predicated on the ground that&nbsp; said resolution was adopted&nbsp; in contravention of&nbsp; the provisions of the by-laws of the&nbsp; corporation, of the Corporation Law and&nbsp; of the understanding, intention and&nbsp; agreement reached among its stockholders.<br><br>Defendant&nbsp; answered the complaint setting up as defense that&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; removed&nbsp; by&nbsp; virtue&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; valid resolution.<br><br>In&nbsp; connection with this&nbsp; complaint, plaintiff moved&nbsp; for the issuance of a&nbsp; writ of preliminary injunction&nbsp; to&nbsp; restrain defendant&nbsp; Jose Manuel&nbsp; Lezama&nbsp; from managing the corporation pending the determination of this case, but&nbsp; after&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; where&nbsp; parties&nbsp; presented testimonial and&nbsp; documentary&nbsp; evidence, the&nbsp; court denied the motion. Thereafter, by agreement&nbsp; of the parties&nbsp; and without any trial&nbsp; on the merits, the case was submitted for judgment on the&nbsp; sole legal&nbsp; question of whether plaintiff could be legally&nbsp; removed as manager&nbsp; of&nbsp; the corporation merely by resolution of the&nbsp; board of directors&nbsp; or whether&nbsp; the affirmative vote of 2/3 of the paid shares of stocks&nbsp; was necessary for&nbsp; that purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; passing&nbsp; upon this legal point, the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court held that the removal of&nbsp; plaintiff was legal and dismissed the complaint without pronouncement&nbsp; as to costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals&nbsp; but finding that the&nbsp; question at issue is one of law, the latter certified&nbsp; the case to us for decision.<br><br>Section S3 of the Corporation Law provides:&nbsp; "Immediately&nbsp; after the election,&nbsp; the directors of a corporation must&nbsp; organize by the election of a&nbsp; president,&nbsp; who must be one of their number, a&nbsp; secretary or clerk who&nbsp; shall be a resident of the Philippines * * * and such other officers as may&nbsp; be provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; by-laws." The&nbsp; by-laws of the&nbsp; instant corporation in turn&nbsp; provide that in&nbsp; the board of directors there shall&nbsp; be a president, a vice-president, a secretary&nbsp; and a&nbsp; treasurer.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the only ones&nbsp; mentioned therein as officers of&nbsp; the corporation. The manager is not included although the latter&nbsp; is mentioned as the person in whom the&nbsp; administration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the corporation is vested,&nbsp; and&nbsp; with the exception of the president, the&nbsp; by-laws provide that the officers of the&nbsp; corporation may be removed&nbsp; or suspended by the affirmative vote&nbsp; of&nbsp; 2/3 of the paid-up shares of the corporation (Exhibit&nbsp; A).<br><br>From the above&nbsp; the following conclusion is clear: that we can&nbsp; only regard as officers of a corporation those who are given that character&nbsp; either by the Corporation Law or&nbsp; by its by-laws,&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest can&nbsp; be considered merely as&nbsp; employees&nbsp; or subordinate officials.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; considering that plaintiff has been appointed manager&nbsp; by the board of&nbsp; directors&nbsp; and as&nbsp; such&nbsp; does not&nbsp; have&nbsp; the&nbsp; character of&nbsp; an officer,&nbsp; the&nbsp; conclusion is inescapable that he can be suspended or removed by said board of directors under such terms as it may see fit and not as provided for&nbsp; in the by-laws.&nbsp; Evidently, the power to appoint carries with it the power to remove,&nbsp; and it would be incongruous&nbsp; to hold that having been appointed by the board&nbsp; of&nbsp; directors he&nbsp; could only be removed by the&nbsp; stockholders.<br><br>The above interpretation&nbsp; finds also support in the American authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fletcher, in his treatise, states the rule in the following&nbsp; wise:&nbsp; "It is sometimes important to determine&nbsp; whether a person&nbsp; representing&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; is to be&nbsp; classed as&nbsp; an officer&nbsp; of the&nbsp; company or merely&nbsp; as an&nbsp; agent&nbsp; or employee,&nbsp; especially in construing&nbsp; statutes relating&nbsp; only to&nbsp; 'officers' of&nbsp; corporations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally the officers of&nbsp; a corporation are enumerated&nbsp; in&nbsp; its charter or by-laws, and include&nbsp; a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and sometimes&nbsp; others.&nbsp; The&nbsp; statutes&nbsp; in most of the states&nbsp; expressly provide for the election&nbsp; of a president,&nbsp; secretary and treasurer, and&nbsp; then&nbsp; provide that there shall be such other officers, agents&nbsp; and factors as&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; shall authorize&nbsp; for that purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; charter expressly&nbsp; enumerates&nbsp; who&nbsp; shall be officers of the company, a person whose position is not enumerated is not an officer&nbsp; as to members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporation, since the&nbsp; charter is conclusive upon them" (Fletcher, Cyclopedia&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Law&nbsp; of&nbsp; Private&nbsp; Corporations,&nbsp; Vol. II,&nbsp; p. 19).&nbsp;&nbsp; It has&nbsp; been&nbsp; likewise&nbsp; held&nbsp; "that the offices pertaining&nbsp; to a private corporation are defined in its charter and by-laws, and that no&nbsp; other positions in&nbsp; the service of&nbsp; the corporation&nbsp; are&nbsp; offices"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Ann.&nbsp; 53&nbsp; A.L.R., 599).<br><br>Indeed,&nbsp; there&nbsp; are authorities&nbsp; galore that hold that a . general manager is not an officer&nbsp; of a corporation, even if his powers and influence may&nbsp; be as great&nbsp; as those of any officer in said organization.<br><blockquote>"Officers Distinguished from Mere Employees.â€”As&nbsp; already&nbsp; stated, both officers&nbsp; and employees&nbsp; are&nbsp; agents of the corporation and&nbsp; the difference between&nbsp; them is&nbsp; largely one&nbsp; of&nbsp; degree;&nbsp; the officers&nbsp; are the most important employees exercising greater&nbsp; authority or power in the management of the business.&nbsp; Ordinarily, too, the principal offices&nbsp; are designated&nbsp; by statute, charter or by-law provisions, and specific duties are imposed upon certain&nbsp; officers.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; the state statute or a by-law&nbsp; may&nbsp; provide that stock certificates&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be signed by the president&nbsp; and&nbsp; countersigned by the secretary or treasurer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The general&nbsp; manager&nbsp; of a corporation is not ordinarily clashed as an&nbsp; officer, but his powers and influence may be&nbsp; quite&nbsp; as great as those of any person&nbsp; in the organization"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Grange, Corporation Law for Officers and&nbsp; Directors,&nbsp; p. 432; Italics supplied.)<br><br>"One distinction&nbsp; between officers and agents of a corporation&nbsp; lies in the&nbsp; manner of their creation.&nbsp;&nbsp; An officer in created by the charter of the corporation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; officer is elected by the directors&nbsp; or&nbsp; the stockholders.&nbsp; An agency is usually created by&nbsp; the&nbsp; officers,&nbsp; or&nbsp; one or more of them, and the agent is appointed by the same authority. It is clear that the two terms officers&nbsp; and agents are&nbsp; by&nbsp; no&nbsp; means interchangeable.&nbsp; One, deriving&nbsp; its&nbsp; existence&nbsp; from the other, and being dependent upon that&nbsp; other&nbsp; for its continuation, is necessarily restricted in its powers&nbsp; and duties, and such powers and duties are not necessarily the same as&nbsp; those pertaining to the authority creating it.&nbsp; The officers, as such, are the&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp; An agent is&nbsp; an employee.&nbsp; 'A mere employment,&nbsp; however liberally compensated, does not rise to the dignity of an office.'&nbsp; 21 Am. &amp; Eng, Enc. Law&nbsp; (2d Ed.) 836.&nbsp; In Wheeler &amp; Wilson&nbsp; Mfg.&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Lawson, 57 Wis. 400, 15 N. W.&nbsp; 398, it was held that under a&nbsp; statute requiring an affidavit to be&nbsp; made&nbsp; by an officer of a&nbsp;&nbsp; corporation,&nbsp; the general agent&nbsp; or 'managing agent, within the state, of&nbsp; a foreign corporation&nbsp; is&nbsp; not an&nbsp; officer.&nbsp; In Farmers' Loan&nbsp; &amp; Trust Co.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Warring, 20 Wis. 305, Service&nbsp; was made&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; 'principal&nbsp; agent'&nbsp; of a corporation holding in trust&nbsp; a&nbsp; railroad,&nbsp; when the&nbsp; statute required service upon a 'principal&nbsp; officer.'&nbsp; In answering&nbsp; the&nbsp; question whether or not&nbsp; the agent&nbsp; was a principal officer the court said:&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is&nbsp; evident he was net, and must be regarded&nbsp; only&nbsp; as an agent, not as&nbsp; an officer of any kind, much&nbsp; less a&nbsp; principal&nbsp; officer.'&nbsp; A ruling that a 'general manager'&nbsp; of a corporation&nbsp; was not authorized to verify pleadings, under&nbsp; a statute&nbsp; requiring verification&nbsp; by&nbsp; 'an&nbsp; officer' was&nbsp; made&nbsp; in Meton <i>vs.</i> Isham Wagon Co. (Sup.) 4 N. Y. Supp. 215.&nbsp; In Raleigh, etc. U. Co. <i>vs.</i> Pullman Co., 122&nbsp; Ga. 704, 50&nbsp; S.E.&nbsp; 1008 (4),&nbsp; it was held that&nbsp; the term&nbsp; 'general manager.' as applied&nbsp; to one representing a&nbsp; corporation, arid especially a&nbsp; railroad corporation,&nbsp; imported&nbsp; an agent&nbsp; of a very extensive authority; but it&nbsp; was not ruled that even the term&nbsp; 'general manager"&nbsp; would import that&nbsp; the person holding that position was necessarily an officer of the company.&nbsp; One distinction between an officer and an agent suggested in Commonwealth <i>vs. </i>Christian, 9 Phila. (Pa.)&nbsp; 558, is that an officer of a corporation, if illegally excluded from his office, may&nbsp; by&nbsp; mandamus compel the corporation to reinstate him; while an agent may be dismissed without cause, and his only remedy&nbsp; would be&nbsp; compensation in&nbsp; damages. It would not be contended that the 'general agent of the defendant at Columbus,' in the&nbsp; event of his&nbsp; discharge, could be&nbsp; reinstated by mandamus.&nbsp; <i>We do not&nbsp; think the general agent at Columbus was ail officer&nbsp; of the defendant company. Therefore his alleged waiver of a condition in the policy was&nbsp; not binding upon the company.</i>" (Vardeman&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Penn. Mut.&nbsp; Life Ins. Co.,&nbsp; 125 Ga. 117, 54 S.E.&nbsp; p. 66; Italics supplied.)<br><br>"The&nbsp; plaintiff predicates this&nbsp; action on said contract, and&nbsp; claims that the same being signed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant through its 'general manager'&nbsp; if admitted in evidence,&nbsp; would show&nbsp; sufficient authority <i>prima facie</i>&nbsp; to do any act&nbsp; which the&nbsp; directors&nbsp; could authorize&nbsp; or ratify.&nbsp; The instrument in question being signed by James W. Codle, ''<i>General Manager</i>', and no&nbsp; evidence on&nbsp; the trial being&nbsp; produced showing the&nbsp; duties&nbsp; of said manager&nbsp; or&nbsp; what kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; office he was&nbsp; general manager of, the words 'general&nbsp; manager' without proof as to&nbsp; the nature of services&nbsp; performed by the&nbsp; person called 'general manager' have no meaning in law, excepting that the person hearing&nbsp; the&nbsp; title is mi employee who has been&nbsp; designated with&nbsp; a title. ' It does&nbsp; not make him an officer&nbsp; of the&nbsp; company employing him."&nbsp; (Studebaker Bros. Co. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; K. M. Rose Co.,&nbsp; 119&nbsp; N.Y.S. pp. 970,&nbsp; 97; Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>We therefore hold that plaintiff has&nbsp; been properly removed&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; board&nbsp; of&nbsp; directors of the instant corporation approved its Resolution No. 65 on June 3,&nbsp; 1948. We will now clarify some&nbsp; of the points raised by the distinguished dissenter&nbsp; in his dissenting opinion. The&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the "manager"&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; in the several statutes enacted&nbsp; by Congress is held criminally liable for violation of any of the&nbsp; penal provisions there-in prescribed does&nbsp; not&nbsp; make him&nbsp; an "officer"&nbsp; of the corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This liability flows from&nbsp; the nature of&nbsp; his duties which&nbsp; are delegated to him by the&nbsp; board of directors. He is paid for them.&nbsp; Hence, he has to answer for them should&nbsp; he use it in violation of law.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case of Robinson&nbsp; <i>vs. </i> Moark-Nemo Consol Mining&nbsp; Co., et&nbsp; al.,&nbsp; 163 S. W. 889, in connection with the liability of the manager, the&nbsp; court said:<br><blockquote>"Common justice and common sense demand that, where those in charge&nbsp; and control of tile management of a corporation direct it along paths of wrongdoing, they should be held&nbsp; accountable by law * * *. This doctrine will prevent many wrongs, and have a salutary influence in bringing&nbsp; about the lawful and orderly management of corporations."<br></blockquote>It is&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; that the cases&nbsp; of Meton <i>vs.</i> Isham Wagon, 4 N.Y.S., 215 and&nbsp; State&nbsp;<i> vs. </i>Bergs,&nbsp; 217 N. W., 736, supporting the theory that a&nbsp; manager&nbsp; is&nbsp; not necessarily an&nbsp; officer,&nbsp; are&nbsp; in<i> illo&nbsp; tempore</i>.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1] </sup></font>&nbsp; It is submitted that we do&nbsp; not adopt a rule just because it is new nor reject another&nbsp;&nbsp; just because it&nbsp; is&nbsp; old.&nbsp; We adopt a rule&nbsp; because&nbsp; it is a good and sound rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact however&nbsp; is that they are not the only authorities supporting that theory.&nbsp; Additional cases are cited&nbsp; by Fletcher in support thereof,&nbsp; such as the cases&nbsp; of Vardeman <i>vs.</i> Penn. Mut. Life Ins. Co.<i>, supra; </i>Studebaker&nbsp; Bros. Co. <i>vs.</i> E. M. Rose&nbsp; Co.,<i> supra.</i><br><br>The&nbsp; dissenting&nbsp; opinion quotes&nbsp; from&nbsp;&nbsp; Thompson&nbsp; and Fletcher&nbsp; to support the theory that the general manager of a corporation may be considered as its principal&nbsp; officer even though not so mentioned&nbsp; in its charter or by-laws.&nbsp; We have examined the cases cited in&nbsp; support of that theory but we have found that&nbsp; they are not in point. Thus, we have&nbsp; found&nbsp; (1) that the parties involved are mostly outsiders who&nbsp; press their&nbsp; transactions against the corporation; (2) that the&nbsp; point raised is whether&nbsp; the acts of the manager bind the corporation;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that the tendency of the courts is&nbsp; to&nbsp; hold the corporation liable for the acts of&nbsp; the&nbsp; manager so long&nbsp; as they are within the powers granted, hence,&nbsp; the courts&nbsp; emphasized&nbsp; the&nbsp; importance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; position of manager; and&nbsp; (4) the&nbsp; position of manager was discussed from the point of view of an outsider and&nbsp; not from the internal organization of the corporation, or in accordance with its charter or by-laws.<br><br>In the present case, however, the parties are the manager and the&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp; And the solution&nbsp; of the problem hinges on the internal government of the corporation where the&nbsp; charter&nbsp; and&nbsp; the by-laws are&nbsp; necessarily involved in the&nbsp; determination&nbsp; of&nbsp; the rights of the parties.&nbsp; Indeed, it has been held: "But it is urged that a corporation may have officers not recognized by the charter&nbsp; and by-laws. <i>It is possible this may be so as&nbsp; to matters arising between strangers and the&nbsp; corporation." </i> [Com. <i>vs. </i>Christian, 9 Phila. (Pa.)&nbsp; 556; italics supplied].<br><br>The cases on all fours with the present&nbsp; are those of State ex&nbsp; rel Blackwood <i>vs.</i> Brast, et al., 127 S. E. 507 and Denton Milling Co. <i>vs.</i> Blewitt, 254 S. W. 236, 238,&nbsp; where the&nbsp; parties involved are&nbsp; the manager and the corporation. The issue raised&nbsp; is the&nbsp; relation of the manager towards the corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The position of the manager is discussed from the point of view&nbsp; of&nbsp; its internal government.&nbsp; And the&nbsp; holding&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court is that the manager is the creation of the board of directors and the agent through&nbsp; whom the&nbsp; corporate duties of the board&nbsp; are performed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the&nbsp; manager holds his&nbsp; position at&nbsp; the pleasure of&nbsp; the board.&nbsp; This stipulation&nbsp; is well expressed in the following words of Thompson:<br><blockquote> "The "word 'manager' implies agency, control,&nbsp; and presumptively sufficient authority to hind&nbsp; a corporation in a case in "which&nbsp; the corporation was an actual party.&nbsp; It has been said that such agent must have the same general supervision of the corporation as is associated with the office of cashier or secretary. <i>By whatever name he may he called, such managing agent is a mere&nbsp; employee&nbsp; of&nbsp; the board of directors and holds hi? position subject to the particular contract of employment; and unless the contract of employment fixes hiss term of office, it may be terminated at the pleasure of the board.</i> *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; * The manager, like&nbsp; any other appointed agent, is subject to removal when his term expires and on the request of&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper officer he should turn over his business to the corporation and, where he refuses&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply,&nbsp; he may be restrained from the further&nbsp; performance of work&nbsp; for&nbsp; the corporation."&nbsp; (Thompson on Corporations, Vol.&nbsp; III, 3rd., pp. 209-210; Italics supplied.) </blockquote>It is not correct to hold that the theory that a manager is not classed as an officer of a&nbsp; corporation is only the minority view.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; we&nbsp; consider the states that hold that managers are merely agents or employees as among those that hold the&nbsp; theory that managers&nbsp; are not&nbsp; necessarily officers,&nbsp; then our theory&nbsp; is&nbsp; supported&nbsp; by the&nbsp; majority view.&nbsp; Indeed, this view is upheld by&nbsp; nine states,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font> where as only six states adopt the view&nbsp; that managers are considered principal officers&nbsp; of&nbsp; the corporation.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[3]</sup></font><br><br>The dissenting opinion&nbsp; quotes the provision of the by-laws relative to the administration of the&nbsp; affairs&nbsp; of the instant corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is there provided that the affairs of the corporation&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be successively administered&nbsp; by (1)&nbsp; the&nbsp; stockholders;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; the board of directors; and (3) the&nbsp; manager.&nbsp; From this it concludes&nbsp; that the manager should be&nbsp; considered an&nbsp; officer.<br><br>The above enumeration&nbsp; only emphasizes&nbsp; the different organs through which the affairs of the corporation should be administered and the order in which the powers should be exercised.&nbsp; The&nbsp; stockholders are the entity composing the whole&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp; The&nbsp; board&nbsp; of&nbsp; directors&nbsp; is&nbsp; the entity&nbsp; elected by the stockholders&nbsp; to&nbsp; manage the&nbsp; affairs&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; the manager is the individual appointed by the board of directors to carry out the powers delegated to him.&nbsp; In other&nbsp; words,&nbsp; the manager&nbsp; is the creation of&nbsp; the board of&nbsp; directors.&nbsp; He is an&nbsp; alter ego of the board.&nbsp;&nbsp; As our law provides that&nbsp; only those enumerated in the charter or&nbsp; in the by-laws&nbsp; are considered officers,&nbsp; the manager who has&nbsp; not been&nbsp; so&nbsp; enumerated therein,&nbsp; but only incidentally mentioned in the order of management, cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered an&nbsp; officer&nbsp; of the corporation within their purview.<br><br>The mere fact that the&nbsp; directors are not mentioned in the&nbsp; by-laws as&nbsp; officers&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; deprive&nbsp; them of their category as such for their character as officers is secured in the charter. The same is not true with the manager. Custom and corporate usages cannot prevail over the express provisions of the charter and the by-laws. <isÂ  such="" forÂ ="" their="" character="" as="" officers="" is="" secured="" in="" the="" charter.Â ="" theÂ ="" sameÂ ="" not="" trueÂ ="" with="" manager.="" customsÂ ="" andÂ ="" corporateÂ ="" usagesÂ ="" cannot="" prevailÂ ="" overÂ ="" express="" provisions="" of="" charter="" by-laws.<br=""><br><br>There is&nbsp; no comparison between an appointee&nbsp; of the President, especially&nbsp; one in&nbsp; the judiciary, and the&nbsp; appointee of the board&nbsp; of directors&nbsp; of a&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first case, removal is&nbsp; especially provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; by&nbsp; law and in the second, the appointee holds office at the pleasure of&nbsp; the&nbsp; board.&nbsp; And&nbsp; with&nbsp; regard to the&nbsp; powers&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the board of directors to&nbsp; remove a&nbsp; manager&nbsp; of the corporation,&nbsp; Thompson has&nbsp; the following to say:<blockquote>* * * Below the grade of director and such other officers as are elected by the corporation at large, the general rule is&nbsp; that the&nbsp; officers of&nbsp; private corporations hold their&nbsp; offices during&nbsp; the will of the directors, and are hence removable by the&nbsp; directors&nbsp; without assigning any&nbsp; cause for&nbsp; the removal,&nbsp; except so far as their power may be restrained by contract with the particular officer,â€”just as any other employer may discharge his employee.&nbsp; Speaking generally, it may be said that the power to appoint carries with it the power to remove.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * * the directors who&nbsp; appoint a&nbsp; ministerial officer may undoubtedly remove&nbsp; him&nbsp; at&nbsp; pleasure,&nbsp; and he has&nbsp; no&nbsp; remedy other&nbsp; than an action for damages against the&nbsp; corporation for a breach of contract.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * The ordinary ministerial and other lesser&nbsp; officers, however, hold their offices during the pleasure of the directors and&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; removed at will, without assigned cause. Of this doss of officers and agents are the&nbsp; secretary and treasurer of the corporation, the general manager,&nbsp; the&nbsp; assistant manager, the field manager, the attorney of the company, an assistant horticulturist, and the bookkeepers."&nbsp; (Thompson on Corporations, Vol.&nbsp; III, 521-523.)</blockquote>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed, with costs against&nbsp; appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C.

On the other hand more than ten cases from eight states of the American&nbsp; Union support the Thompson and Fletcher excerpts above quoted.&nbsp; Clearly&nbsp; the choice&nbsp; of this Court's majority,&nbsp; reflects the minority view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse still, it ignores the Congressional viewpoint.<br><br>The majority&nbsp; decision&nbsp; draws&nbsp; the&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; that the manager is not an officer, from&nbsp; these two propositions or premises:&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally,&nbsp; the&nbsp; officers&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp; corporation are mentioned&nbsp; in its&nbsp; charter as&nbsp; an&nbsp; officer in the&nbsp; by-laws of the La Paz Ice&nbsp;&nbsp; Plant and Cold&nbsp; Storage Co.,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; Let me analyze these propositions in their order.<br><br>III. <i>By-laws mention manager.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the first,&nbsp; observe the word&nbsp; "generally."&nbsp; The&nbsp; quotations from&nbsp; Thompson and Fletcher do not rest on the charter or by-laws of the corporation.&nbsp; They consider the duties and powers of the position.&nbsp; And our own laws, the Usury Law,&nbsp; the Price Control Law, the&nbsp; Law on Employment&nbsp; of&nbsp; Women and Children,&nbsp; the Chemistry Law, the Minimum&nbsp; Wage Law, the Chemical Engineering Law, the Labor or Sunday Law, etc., postulate the manager's&nbsp; dominant official position in the corporate set-up regardless of whether he is mentioned in the&nbsp; by-laws.&nbsp; The&nbsp; first proposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority decision could&nbsp; be&nbsp; applied&nbsp; to&nbsp; other&nbsp; less&nbsp; known officials, such as the&nbsp; cashier, the auditor, superintendent, branch manager,&nbsp; etc.<br><br>Nevertheless,&nbsp; for the sake&nbsp; of&nbsp; argument, I will admit the first proposition&nbsp; as an absolute&nbsp; rule, with&nbsp; no&nbsp; exceptions:&nbsp; officers of the corporation must&nbsp; be&nbsp; mentioned in its charter and/or by-laws.&nbsp; Is&nbsp; the manager mentioned in the&nbsp; by-laws of the La Paz Ice Plant?&nbsp; I say yes, definitely; and&nbsp; I&nbsp; quote the by-laws:<br><center><br>"ABMINISTBACION"<br></center><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; ll.o-)-Para ]os efectos del Gobicrno y administraeion de la Corporaeion, se eonsidcrara corno central, la ofieina de&nbsp; la Corporacion en La Pan, Iloilo, I.

And our Rules recognize in him power to represent the&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; as an officer<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[11]</sup></font> thereof, because said&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; provide&nbsp; that&nbsp; service of summons upon the manager is service in the corporation.<br><br>VI. <i>Appointing power, sometimes&nbsp; not power to remove.</i><br><br>The&nbsp; majority&nbsp; finds it hard to believe that being&nbsp; an appointee of the board&nbsp; of&nbsp; directors, the manager could not be removed by&nbsp; the latter.&nbsp; They&nbsp; forget that in&nbsp; the law of officers such&nbsp; a&nbsp; situation often obtains.&nbsp; The President appoints the&nbsp; members of this Court, and other officials; but he&nbsp; cannot remove them.&nbsp; True, the Constitution so provides.&nbsp; But in this case also the by-laws&nbsp; of the&nbsp; corporation so provide:&nbsp; its&nbsp; officers may be removed only by two-thirds vote&nbsp; of the paid-up shares.<br><br>Their decision does not explain, but the majority's thinking appears to be influenced by the apprehension&nbsp; that if Gurrea's contention&nbsp; (2/3 vote)&nbsp; is now&nbsp; sustained, he may never be replaced, because he own one-half of the&nbsp; shares, and he&nbsp; may abuse his powers.&nbsp; To me that is a groundless worry.&nbsp; The board&nbsp; of directors has means to&nbsp; check. And&nbsp; then, what are courts for?&nbsp; Where is&nbsp; the protection extended&nbsp; to&nbsp; stockholders against&nbsp; abuses of&nbsp; those&nbsp; in control?<br><br>VII. <i>Stockholders&nbsp; intended&nbsp; security&nbsp; for manager.</i>&nbsp; It would be interesting to inquire whether in approving the two-thirds requirement in the by-laws, the stockholders intended to apply it only to the Vice President, the Secretary&nbsp; and the Treasurerâ€”excluding the&nbsp; managerâ€”as&nbsp; the majority&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; declares.<br><br>It must be remembered that since&nbsp; the beginning, Gurrea's&nbsp; family&nbsp; owned or&nbsp; controlled one-half of the shares and Manuel&nbsp; Lezama's&nbsp; family&nbsp; the other half.&nbsp; Evidently, because Gurrea voted for them, Lezama and two others of his family became directors in the&nbsp; five-man board of directors. In&nbsp; reciprocity for such vote or concession, Gurrea was named manager.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[12]</sup></font>&nbsp; As owner of one-half of&nbsp; the shares Gurrea could&nbsp; effectively block&nbsp; approval of any&nbsp; bylaws&nbsp; that did&nbsp; not protect&nbsp; his interest.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; he would not have approved&nbsp; the by-laws in question if they did not protect his position as manager<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[13]</sup></font>, knowing that <i>being in the minority in the board of directors his position would be&nbsp; at&nbsp; the mercy </i> of the Lezama family.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bargain between the&nbsp; Lezama&nbsp; and&nbsp; Gurrea families must have been this:&nbsp; Majority of directors of Lezama; minority&nbsp; for Gurrea plus&nbsp; the&nbsp; position&nbsp; of manager;<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[14]</sup></font> the Lezama&nbsp; directors cannot be&nbsp; changed by Gurrea alone (he owns one half only); and&nbsp; Gurrea may not be changed by the Lezama directors&nbsp; (they&nbsp; have one-half shares only).<br><br>In fact&nbsp; this arrangement continued for a long period of time (beginning in the year 1927) until the Lezamas thought of the "appointed-by-directors-removed-by-directors" idea in 1948-ironically&nbsp; enough,&nbsp; after the corporation&nbsp; had&nbsp; declared&nbsp; substantial dividends<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[15]</sup></font> under Gurrea's management. VIII. My vote goes without hesitation to appellant Gurrea, with&nbsp; due respect of course to the&nbsp; majority&nbsp; opinion.

It consists&nbsp; in using the same&nbsp; word&nbsp; in different&nbsp; meanings, for example:&nbsp; Spirits are&nbsp; incorporeal; liquors are&nbsp; spirits; therefore, liquors are incorporeal. The wrong conclusion stems from the fallacy of&nbsp; employing "spirits" in&nbsp; a double meaning.<br><br>Reduced to&nbsp; a shorter syllogism,&nbsp; the&nbsp; majority's position is this:&nbsp; manager is agent of the&nbsp; corporation; Agent&nbsp; is not officer; therefore, manager is not officer.<br><br>With all due respect,&nbsp; I say, there is sophistical "equivocation" here.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the major premise "agent"&nbsp; is used in general (common&nbsp; noun)&nbsp; to&nbsp; denote&nbsp; "representative," any one acting or speaking for the corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas, Agent in the second&nbsp; premise&nbsp; (capital letter, because proper noun) is&nbsp; used in particular,&nbsp; i.e.,&nbsp; a person occupying the position in the corporation designated "Managing&nbsp; Agent" "General&nbsp; Agent"&nbsp; "Principal Agent"&nbsp; or simply&nbsp; "Agent". The decisions supporting this second&nbsp; premise simply hold that this or that particular "General Agent" or "Managing Agent" or "Agent" is not classified&nbsp; as an officer of the corporation,&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of his powers or&nbsp; responsibilities.<br><br>There is no decision declaring that "all agents&nbsp; (in general) of the corporation are not&nbsp; its officers"; because&nbsp; it would not&nbsp; be&nbsp; correct, the President of a corporation being admittedly its officer, and also its agent&nbsp; (not capital letter), since he acts for&nbsp; and on behalf of the corporation.&nbsp; Following&nbsp; the majority's reasoning it may be argued:&nbsp; the president&nbsp; of&nbsp; a corporation&nbsp; is agent&nbsp; thereof, Agents&nbsp; of the corporation are not officers thereof; hence, the&nbsp; president&nbsp; is not&nbsp; officer. Absurd, no?&nbsp; "Equivocation" again. Second&nbsp; fallacy.â€”Disputing my position that eight&nbsp; states consider managers as&nbsp; officers, the majority come&nbsp; out with "only six&nbsp; states adopt the view&nbsp; that managers&nbsp; are considered&nbsp; principal&nbsp; officers of the corporation."&nbsp; The issue may&nbsp; I&nbsp; remind them,&nbsp; is whether managers&nbsp; are officers.<br><br>Whether&nbsp; principal or not,&nbsp; is immaterial.&nbsp; One abundant source . of&nbsp; fallacies&nbsp; consists&nbsp; in&nbsp; ignoring or&nbsp; evading&nbsp; the issue.&nbsp; Aristotle called it ignoratio elenchi.<br><br>Twelve&nbsp; states support dissent.â€”Let me now seek&nbsp; to reinforce&nbsp; the ranks&nbsp; of the opposition.&nbsp; Four states, in&nbsp; addition to&nbsp; those already mentioned in my above&nbsp; dissent, may&nbsp; be&nbsp; counted&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the managers-are-officers&nbsp; column.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[4]</sup></font> That makes&nbsp; twelve states&nbsp; on my side, which should&nbsp; be held to&nbsp; be the&nbsp; right side&nbsp; if only in deference&nbsp; to the Congressional viewpoint clearly&nbsp; implied in the&nbsp; statutes I have indicated.<br><br>LABRADOR, <i>J.,</i>&nbsp; concurring in&nbsp; the dissenting opinion&nbsp; of Justice&nbsp; Bengzon:<br><br>I concur in the above&nbsp; dissent of Mr. Justice Bengzon.

It&nbsp; is not, therefore,&nbsp; correct to say that&nbsp; the&nbsp; manager&nbsp; is not an officer&nbsp; just&nbsp; because his&nbsp; duties&nbsp; are&nbsp; not defined&nbsp; in those articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, as Mr. Justice Bengzon points out in his dissent,&nbsp; neither are the duties of the directors enumerated therein&nbsp; and yet&nbsp; there is&nbsp; no denying that the directors are also officers of the&nbsp; corporation.<br><br>I&nbsp; must&nbsp; take exception&nbsp; to the theory&nbsp; of the majority that as&nbsp; the manager is appointed by the Board of Directors he&nbsp; may be suspended or removed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Board&nbsp; "under such terms as&nbsp; it may see fit and not as may be provided by the by-laws."&nbsp; Under what principle of the&nbsp; corporation law could&nbsp; the&nbsp; pretense&nbsp; be justified that&nbsp; the board&nbsp; of directors may&nbsp; disregard the by-laws,&nbsp; when the&nbsp; validity of these are not questioned?<br><br>On the other hand, there is good reason for believing that the by-laws requiring a two-third&nbsp; vote&nbsp; of the paid-up stocks for the removal&nbsp; of an&nbsp; officer of&nbsp; this&nbsp; corporation was meant precisely to prevent the removal of the manager by the Board of&nbsp; Directors alone.&nbsp; This is&nbsp; made clear in the&nbsp; following&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of Mr.&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; Bengzon's dissenting&nbsp; opinion:<br><blockquote>"VI. Stockholders&nbsp; intended security for manager.&nbsp; It would&nbsp; be interesting to inquire whether in approving the&nbsp; two-thirds requirement in the by-laws, the stockholders&nbsp; <i>intended</i> to&nbsp; apply&nbsp; it only to the Vice-President, the Secretary and the Treasurerâ€”excluding the managerâ€”as&nbsp; the majority opinion declares.<br><br>" It must be remembeyed that since the beginning, Gurrea's family owned&nbsp; or&nbsp; controlled one-half&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; shares&nbsp; and Manuel&nbsp; Lezaroa's family&nbsp; the other half.&nbsp; Evidently, because Gurrea voted for them, Lezama and two others of his family&nbsp; became directors in the five man board of directors. In reciprocity for such vote or concession, Gurrea was named manager.&nbsp; As owner of one-half of the shares Gurrea could effectively block&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of any by-laws&nbsp; that did not protect his interests.&nbsp; Therefore, he would&nbsp; not&nbsp; have approved the by-laws in question if&nbsp; they did not protect his position&nbsp; as&nbsp; manager, knowing that being in the minority in the board of directors his position would be at the mercy of the Lezama family.&nbsp; The bargain between the Lezama&nbsp; and&nbsp; Gurrea families must&nbsp; have been&nbsp; this: Majority of&nbsp; directors&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lezama; minority for&nbsp; Gurrea&nbsp; plus the position of manager;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Lezama directors cannot be changed&nbsp; by Gurrea alone&nbsp; (he&nbsp; owns one-half only);&nbsp; and Gurrea&nbsp; may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be changed by the Lezama directors&nbsp; (they&nbsp; have one-half shares&nbsp; only)."</blockquote>With&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; clarification&nbsp; of the&nbsp; situation&nbsp; that led to the approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the by-law on the removal&nbsp; of&nbsp; officers, I think this Court&nbsp; would&nbsp; do&nbsp; well to rely, less on the technicalities&nbsp; of&nbsp; definition and&nbsp; adhere&nbsp; more to&nbsp; its&nbsp; function of&nbsp; giving&nbsp; effect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; by-law&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with its purpose.<br></isÂ ></div>
