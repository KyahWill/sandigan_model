				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an appeal by certiorari against the decision&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Industrial Relations&nbsp; granting&nbsp; twenty-six employees&nbsp; and laborers who are members of the United Employees' Welfare Association&nbsp; an additional&nbsp; compensation of 50&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent for night duty during&nbsp; the period from January 1, 1950 to December 31, 1952.&nbsp; The&nbsp; decision was rendered after trial of Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 244-V, instituted by the said. United Employees'&nbsp; Welfare Association against the Detective and Protective Bureau,&nbsp; Inc.<br><br>Two defenses&nbsp; were set up in the court below, namely, (1) that the defendant corporation had ceased to exist&nbsp; by reason of&nbsp; its insolvency and&nbsp; a new corporation&nbsp; organized distinct from the original one, with which last corporation petitioner&nbsp; had&nbsp; no labor relations&nbsp; or dispute, and&nbsp; (2) that the employees asking for.additional compensation for night duty&nbsp; were made to understand&nbsp; that&nbsp; they would not&nbsp; be paid additional compensation for work at night time because salaries were fixed for such work at night.<br><br>The court below found that the defendant corporation is the&nbsp; same&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; former respondent&nbsp; corporation;&nbsp; it therefore&nbsp; held&nbsp; it&nbsp; to&nbsp; have assumed the&nbsp; obligations and liabilities of the former.&nbsp;&nbsp; No fact or circumstance is given on this appeal why this finding of fact by the court <i>a quo</i> is incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp; contrary, it may be added that&nbsp; as the former corporation had not filed insolvency proceedings, its defense of bankruptcy and insolvency can not be sustained.<br><br>The second defense&nbsp; was also correctly overruled&nbsp; by the court <i>a quo.</i> The decision is&nbsp; based on our ruling&nbsp; in the case of&nbsp; The&nbsp; Shell Co. vs. National Labor Union,&nbsp; 46 Off. Gaz., Sup. to No. 1, 97, July 26, 1948, where we held that work done at night is more strenuous than that performed during the day&nbsp; time;&nbsp; that it is attended by innumerable inconveniences for hygienic, medical,&nbsp; moral, cultural and sociological reasons and, therefore, deserves more compensation than&nbsp; work&nbsp; done&nbsp; during&nbsp; daytime;&nbsp; and that the Court of Industrial Relations has&nbsp; the right to&nbsp; consider these circumstances&nbsp; and grant for&nbsp; night work additional compensation amounting&nbsp; to 50 per cent.<br><br>We find no reason for&nbsp; modifying the&nbsp; decision appealed from and we hereby affirm the same&nbsp; in toto, with costs against&nbsp; the petitioner.<br><br><i>Par√°s, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes,&nbsp; J. B. L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i> concur.</div>
