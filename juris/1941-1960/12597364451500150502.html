				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">.This is a petition filed&nbsp; in the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Rizal&nbsp; for a declaration&nbsp; that petitioner&nbsp; is a widow of her&nbsp; husband Francisco&nbsp; Chuidian who is presumed to be dead and has'-no legal impediment to contract a subsequent marriage.<br><br>The Solicitor General opposed the petition on the ground that the same is not authorized by law.&nbsp; After petitioner had presented&nbsp; her&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court sustained the opposition&nbsp; and dismissed the petition.&nbsp; Hence this&nbsp; appeal. Lourdes G. Lukban, petitioner herein, contracted marriage with Francisco Chuidian&nbsp; on&nbsp; December 10,&nbsp; 1933 at the Paco Catholic Church, Manila.&nbsp; On December&nbsp; 27, of the same year, Francisco left Lourdes after a&nbsp; violent quarrel arid since then he has not been heard from despite diligent&nbsp; search&nbsp; made&nbsp; by&nbsp; her.&nbsp; She also&nbsp; inquired about him from his parents and friends&nbsp; but no&nbsp; one was&nbsp; able to indicate&nbsp; his&nbsp; whereabouts.&nbsp; She&nbsp; has no&nbsp; knowledge&nbsp; if he is still alive, his last known address being Calle Merced, Paco, Manila.&nbsp; She&nbsp; believes&nbsp; that he is already&nbsp; dead because he had been&nbsp; absent for&nbsp; more than twenty&nbsp; years, and because&nbsp; she intends to marry again, she desires&nbsp; that her civil&nbsp; status be defined in order that she may&nbsp; be relieved of any liability&nbsp; under&nbsp; the law.<br><br>We believe that the petition&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar comes within the purview&nbsp; of our&nbsp; decision&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case of Nicolai Szartraw, 46 Off. Gaz., 1st Sup., 243, wherein&nbsp; it was held that a petition for judicial&nbsp; declaration that petitioner's husband is <i>presumed, to be dead</i> cannot be entertained because&nbsp; it&nbsp; is not authorized&nbsp; by law, and if such&nbsp; declaration cannot be made in&nbsp; a special proceeding similar to the present, much less can the court determine the status of petitioner as a widow since this matter must&nbsp; of necessity depend&nbsp; upon the fact&nbsp; of&nbsp; death of&nbsp; the husband.&nbsp; This&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; can declare upon proper evidence, but&nbsp; not to decree&nbsp; that he is merely presumed&nbsp; to be dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Nicolai&nbsp; Szartraw, 46 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 1st sup. 243).<br><br>The philosophy behind the ruling that&nbsp; such&nbsp; judicial pronouncement cannot be made in&nbsp; a proceeding of&nbsp; this nature is well&nbsp; expressed in&nbsp; the case above-cited.&nbsp; Thus, we there&nbsp; said that "A judicial pronouncement to that effect, even if final and executory,&nbsp; would&nbsp; still be a <i>prima facie</i> presumption&nbsp; only.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; still disputable.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is for&nbsp; that reason that it cannot be the subject of a judicial pronouncement&nbsp; or&nbsp; declaration, if it is the only question or matter involved&nbsp; in a case, or upon which a competent court has to pass * *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is, therefore, clear that&nbsp; a judicial&nbsp; declaration&nbsp; that a person is presumptively dead, because&nbsp; he had been unheard from in seven years, being a presumption <span style="font-style: italic;">juris tantum</span> only,&nbsp; subject to contrary proof, cannot reach the stage of finality or become final."<br><br>Appellant&nbsp; claims that&nbsp; the&nbsp; remedy she&nbsp; is&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; for can be granted in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present proceedings because in the case of Hagans<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Wislizenus, 42 Phil., 880, it was declared that a special&nbsp; proceeding is "an&nbsp; application or proceeding to establish <span style="font-style: italic;">the status</span> or right of a party, or&nbsp; a&nbsp; particular fact"&nbsp; but, as already said,&nbsp; that remedy can be&nbsp; invoked if the purpose is to&nbsp; seek the declaration&nbsp; of death of the husband, and&nbsp; not, as in&nbsp; the present case,&nbsp; to "establish a presumption of death.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it can be satisfactorily&nbsp; proven that the husband is dead, the court would not certainly deny&nbsp; a&nbsp; declaration to&nbsp; that effect&nbsp; as has&nbsp; been intimated in the case of&nbsp; Nicolas Szartraw,,<span style="font-style: italic;"> supra.</span><br><br>Appellant&nbsp; also claims&nbsp; that&nbsp; the present petition&nbsp; can&nbsp; be entertained because article 3.49 of the Revised Penal Code, in defining bigamy, provides that&nbsp; a person commits that crime&nbsp; if&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; contracts&nbsp; a second&nbsp; marriage&nbsp; "before&nbsp; the absent spouse has been&nbsp; declared&nbsp; presumptively dead&nbsp; by means of a judgment rendered in the proper proceedings" and, it is claimed, the&nbsp; present&nbsp; petition comes within the purview&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; legal&nbsp; provision.&nbsp; The argument&nbsp; is&nbsp; untenable&nbsp; for the words "proper&nbsp; proceedings" used&nbsp; in said article can only refer to&nbsp; those authorized&nbsp; by&nbsp; law&nbsp; such as those which refer to the administration or settlement of the estate of a deceased person (Articles S90 and 391, new Civil&nbsp; Code).&nbsp;&nbsp; That such is&nbsp; the correct&nbsp; interpretation of the provision&nbsp; in question finds&nbsp; support&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case of Jones <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hortiguela, 64 Phil., 179, wherein this Court made the following&nbsp; comment:<br><blockquote>"For the purposes&nbsp; of the civil marriage law,&nbsp; it is not&nbsp; necessary to have&nbsp; the former&nbsp; spouse&nbsp; judicially&nbsp; declared an&nbsp; absentee.&nbsp;&nbsp; The declaration of absence made in accordance with the provisions of the Civil&nbsp; Code has for its sole purpose&nbsp; to enable the taking of the necessary precautions for the administration of the estate of the absentee.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the celebration of civil&nbsp; marriage, however, the&nbsp; law only requires that the&nbsp; former&nbsp; Spouse has&nbsp; been&nbsp; absent. for seven consecutive&nbsp; years&nbsp; at the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of the&nbsp; second&nbsp; marriage, that, the spouse present does not know his or her former spouse to&nbsp; be living, that such former&nbsp; spouse is&nbsp; generally reputed to be dead and the spouse present so believes at the time&nbsp; of&nbsp; the celebration, of the marriage (section III, paragraph 2, General Orders, No. 68)."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; without&nbsp; pronouncement aa&nbsp; to costs. <br><br><i>Par√°s,&nbsp; C.
