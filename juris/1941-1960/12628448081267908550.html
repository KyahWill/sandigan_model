				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition&nbsp; for certiorari and mandamus filed by Ciriaco P. Garcia&nbsp; against&nbsp; respondents Jose P. Flores, who at one time presided over the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Albay, Juan&nbsp; Garcia, Baldomera Garcia, and Paula Garcia,&nbsp; brother&nbsp; and sisters of petitioner Ciriaco, and Martin Garcia and&nbsp; Mercedes&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Garcia,&nbsp; his&nbsp; nephew and&nbsp; niece, respectively,&nbsp; to&nbsp; set aside certain orders issued by the trial judge in Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 38 of the Albay&nbsp; court, and to compel said&nbsp; trial judge to order some&nbsp; things done in connection with the proceedings in said civil case.&nbsp; The petition&nbsp; was given due&nbsp; course and&nbsp; respondents filed&nbsp; their answers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; later, their memorandum in lieu&nbsp; of oral argument. <br><br>The facts&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case as revealed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; pleadings and their annexes may be briefly stated&nbsp; as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; On July 21, 1880, Martin Garcia, a&nbsp; Catholic Chinese,&nbsp; married Hilaria Pordesimo in&nbsp; Guinobatan,&nbsp; Albay.&nbsp; They&nbsp; had six children&nbsp; named Albina&nbsp; Pordesimo&nbsp; <i>alias</i> Albina&nbsp; Garcia, Pedro Pordesimo <i>alias</i> Juan&nbsp; Garcia;&nbsp; Paula, Baldomera, Ciriaco and&nbsp; Ignacia <i>alias</i>&nbsp; Rosario,&nbsp; all surnamed&nbsp; Garcia, It is said that the first two were natural&nbsp; children&nbsp; of Hilaria by an&nbsp; unknown father, but it is equally&nbsp; claimed that&nbsp; said two&nbsp; children&nbsp; were&nbsp; natural children&nbsp; of&nbsp; both Hilaria and&nbsp; Martin Garcia, who were subsequently&nbsp; legitimated by their subsequent, marriage. <br><br>On July 6, 1904, Martin&nbsp; Garcia died intestate&nbsp; in&nbsp; Guinobatan,&nbsp; Albay, leaving as his heirs&nbsp; his widow&nbsp; Hilaria&nbsp; and their six children.&nbsp; It would appear that on May 16, 1912, said heirs executed an&nbsp; axtra judicial&nbsp; partition, evidenced by Annex A of Juan&nbsp; Garcia's original and amended answers,&nbsp; dividing&nbsp; among themselves&nbsp; the properties left&nbsp; by Martin Garcia.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 1, 1924, Hilaria the widow died&nbsp; intestate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1949, that&nbsp; is, about thirty-seven years after the alleged extra judicial partition, one&nbsp; of the heirs,&nbsp; Paula Garcia, assisted by&nbsp; her&nbsp; husband, Felipe Palencia, commenced Civil Case No.&nbsp; 38 of the Albay court already mentioned, against Juan, Baldomera, Ciriaco, Martin, and&nbsp; Mercedes,&nbsp; all surnamed&nbsp; Garcia, for partition of real and&nbsp; personal&nbsp; properties, referring apparently to the&nbsp; same hereditary estate&nbsp; previously&nbsp; partitioned among&nbsp; herself and&nbsp; her&nbsp; co-heirs in 1912, and&nbsp; for damages.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; defendants in said case filed their respective answers on or about August, 1949, except herein petitioner Ciriaco who filed&nbsp; his answer on&nbsp; October 24, 1949. <br><br>On June 16,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; in&nbsp; said&nbsp; case filed an unverified petition for the appointment of an&nbsp; administrator or receiver,&nbsp; under Rule&nbsp; 61 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court.&nbsp; The petition was opposed by the defendants, except the herein petitioner Ciriaco, on the ground that the action being one for&nbsp; partition, no&nbsp; administration&nbsp; was necessary,&nbsp; and that the&nbsp; appointment of a&nbsp; receiver&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; irregular; that the petition was unverified and did not&nbsp; contain allegations sufficient&nbsp; to&nbsp; warrant the appointment of a receiver under Rule 61&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Rules&nbsp; of Court;&nbsp; that,, furthermore,&nbsp; an application for a&nbsp; receiver should be&nbsp; made not by motion but&nbsp; by a&nbsp; petition under oath supported&nbsp; by affidavits.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp; bases&nbsp; of the opposition, the trial&nbsp; court by&nbsp; order of March 14, 1953 denied the petition to appoint&nbsp; an administrator or receiver.&nbsp; On March 24, 1953, the&nbsp; plaintiffs and herein petitioner&nbsp; Ciriaco&nbsp; moved&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; reconsideration of the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of denial and&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; was denied by order of March 28, 1953.<br><br>On&nbsp; January 20, 1954, that is, almost five&nbsp; years after the&nbsp; defendants, including their&nbsp; co-defendant Ciriaco, had filed their answers to the complaint, Ciriaco&nbsp; filed a motion for&nbsp; a bill of&nbsp; particulars&nbsp; and&nbsp; production of&nbsp; documents, praying&nbsp; that&nbsp; his&nbsp; co-defendants amend their respective answers by&nbsp; making more particular&nbsp; certain&nbsp; allegations in their&nbsp; answer,&nbsp; and&nbsp; to&nbsp; include therein&nbsp; certain documents proving&nbsp; their title or ownership of the lands&nbsp; involved in the&nbsp; action for partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 1, 1954,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court granted&nbsp; the motion for a bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; particulars. <br><br>On February 23, 1954, that is, about&nbsp; one&nbsp; year&nbsp; after the trial court had denied the motion&nbsp; for the appointment of an&nbsp; administrator or a&nbsp; receiver,&nbsp; defendant Ciriaco&nbsp; filed another motion for&nbsp; the&nbsp; appointment of an&nbsp; administrator, which motion&nbsp; was heard&nbsp; on February&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; without opposition&nbsp; because his co-defendants failed&nbsp; to receive a&nbsp; copy of the motion on time.&nbsp; On the same date, and&nbsp; based&nbsp; on the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of any&nbsp; opposition,&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion was granted and one Melencio O. Orbase was appointed&nbsp; administrator. <br><br>On March 11,&nbsp; 1954, petitioner Ciriaco filed a motion for the&nbsp; striking out of certain allegations in his co-defendants' answers and for a judgment on the pleadings. <br><br>After receiving copy of the order of the trial court of February 27,&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; appointing&nbsp; Orbase&nbsp; administrator, respondents filed a motion on March 20, 1954&nbsp; to&nbsp; set aside said order&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; that&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; of Ciriaco for the appointment of an administrator was received by them two days after&nbsp; it was heard on February 27, 1954, besides the fact that the question of the appointment of an administrator&nbsp; had already been&nbsp; finally decided adversely by the court in&nbsp; its order of March&nbsp; 14, 1953. <br><br>On&nbsp; April&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1954, respondents&nbsp; also&nbsp; filed a motion&nbsp; to set&nbsp; aside the&nbsp; order of February 1, 1954, granting the motion for a bill of&nbsp; particulars, on the ground that&nbsp; they did&nbsp; not receive a copy of&nbsp; the motion for&nbsp; said bill of&nbsp; particulars&nbsp; before the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was heard, and that&nbsp; petitioner Ciriaco, being a defendant in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 38, was not the&nbsp; proper party and lacked legal personality to require his co-defendants to make more particular the allegations in their respective answers. <br><br>On June 5, 1954, the lower court reconsidered its order of February 27, 1954, appointing an administrator, on the ground that&nbsp; it had&nbsp; already and finally&nbsp; decided against said appointment of&nbsp; an administrator&nbsp; or receiver by&nbsp; its order of March 14,&nbsp; 1953.<br><br>On August 23,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court issued&nbsp; an order setting aside its orders of February 1, 1954, granting the motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; a bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; particulars,&nbsp; and&nbsp; denying&nbsp; Ciriaco's motion&nbsp; of March&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 1954, praying&nbsp; for the&nbsp; striking out of certain&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; in his co-defendants' answers&nbsp; and for judgment on the pleadings. <br><br>On December 7,&nbsp; 1955, petitioner Ciriaco filed an amended motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; a new&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; and reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the order of August 23, 1955, but said motion was denied by an order dated&nbsp; December&nbsp; 19, 1955. <br><br>As already stated,&nbsp; the&nbsp; present&nbsp; petition for certiorari and&nbsp; mandamus&nbsp; seeks&nbsp; to declare&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court's orders of June 5,&nbsp; 1954 and&nbsp; August&nbsp; 23, 1955 null and void as having&nbsp; been&nbsp; issued in&nbsp; excess&nbsp; of jurisdiction and&nbsp; with grave abuse of discretion, and to order respondent Judge to allow Orbase to resume&nbsp; his duties&nbsp; and functions as administrator of&nbsp; the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; involved&nbsp; in&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Case No. 38; also to&nbsp; strike&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; record&nbsp; all pleadings filed by Atty. Domingo D. Sison&nbsp; in said&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 38, as well as&nbsp; those parts of the&nbsp; answers of his&nbsp; (Ciriaco's) co-defendants (Juan, Martin and Mercedes, all surnamed Garcia), which they failed to amend, as previously ordered by the trial&nbsp; court in its order&nbsp; of February 1, 1954,&nbsp; and for the trial court to&nbsp; render judgment on the pleadings. <br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; claims that once the trial court had&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; the appointment&nbsp; of Orbase&nbsp; as&nbsp; administrator&nbsp; by its order of February&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1954, and&nbsp; after the latter&nbsp; had assumed office, said trial court had lost control over the said&nbsp; appointment and it&nbsp; could not set&nbsp; aside the same even on motion by the&nbsp; proper party;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that furthermore, to' set aside the order authorizing an appointment is&nbsp; equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; a removal of&nbsp; said administrator without&nbsp; cause. What was the nature&nbsp; and effect of the&nbsp; order appointing an administrator&nbsp; in said&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 38?&nbsp; Was it a final or merely an interlocutory order? <br><br>Examining&nbsp; plaintiffs'&nbsp; reply&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendants' opposition to the appointment of&nbsp; an administrator or receiver, their memorandum in support thereof&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as Ciriaco's&nbsp; memorandum supporting&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs' petition for an&nbsp; appointment&nbsp; of an administrator or receiver, it&nbsp; will be seen that they all invoked the provisions of Rules 61 and 81 of the Rules of&nbsp; Court&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; receivership and special administration,&nbsp; respectively, meaning that what plaintiffs and&nbsp; petitioner herein really wanted&nbsp; was the appointment of either a receiver or&nbsp; special administrator.&nbsp; We hold that an&nbsp; order&nbsp; appointing&nbsp; a special administrator&nbsp; or&nbsp; a receiver&nbsp; is&nbsp; of interlocutory nature,&nbsp; merely incidental to judicial proceedings; that the court making the appointment retains control over it and that it may modify,&nbsp; rescind, or revoke the same on sufficient grounds at any time before final judgment;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; an order appointing&nbsp; a special administrator or&nbsp; a&nbsp; receiver is not appealable,&nbsp; for the reason that&nbsp; far from being final, it&nbsp; is merely&nbsp; interlocutory&nbsp; in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such&nbsp; was our&nbsp; holding&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; cases of Samson vs Barrios&nbsp; (63 Phil.&nbsp; 198), Borja vs.&nbsp; Tan 97 Phil., 872; 51 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [11] 5588), and&nbsp; Manila Electric Co. vs. Artiaga&nbsp; and Green&nbsp; (50 Phil.&nbsp; 144).&nbsp; See also Section&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; Rule 61 of&nbsp; the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; authorizing&nbsp; the trial court to discharge a receiver already appointed when convinced&nbsp; that&nbsp; such appointment was&nbsp; procured&nbsp; without sufficient&nbsp; cause; and Section&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; of Rule 105,&nbsp; to the effect that an appointment of a special administrator is not appealable.&nbsp; Fom all this it&nbsp; is clear that the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; not only&nbsp; had jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; revoke&nbsp; his&nbsp; order&nbsp; appointing Orbase&nbsp; as administrator,&nbsp; but that he&nbsp; had authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so&nbsp; in the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; his sound discretion. <br><br>As regards the setting aside by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Judge of his order of February&nbsp; 1, 1954, granting&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; a bill&nbsp; of particulars from&nbsp; his co-defendants, it will&nbsp; be recalled&nbsp; that the reason for&nbsp; issuing said&nbsp; order of February 1, 1954 was&nbsp; because&nbsp; of the failure&nbsp; of the petitioner's co-defendants&nbsp; to&nbsp; oppose petitioner's motion&nbsp; for said bill&nbsp; of particulars.&nbsp; Later&nbsp; on, however, it turned out that said co-defendants were not served a copy of the motion&nbsp; before&nbsp; the hearing thereof, hence their failure to oppose&nbsp; the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; Moreover, petitioner, as a&nbsp; defendant in said&nbsp; Civil Case No.&nbsp; 88, was&nbsp; hardly&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper party to ask&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; bill of particulars from his&nbsp; co-defendants. It was&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; who had&nbsp; such a&nbsp; right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner claims,&nbsp; however, that he&nbsp; was only&nbsp; a&nbsp; pro-forma&nbsp; plaintiff because his&nbsp; interests in the case&nbsp; were identified with those of the plaintiffs' and that his said interests were in conflict with those of his co-defendants.&nbsp; If that&nbsp; was the case,&nbsp; his remedy was&nbsp; to&nbsp; file a&nbsp; cross-claim against said co-defendants,&nbsp; which he failed to do.&nbsp; Furthermore, petitioner's&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; particulars&nbsp; from his co-defendants&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; rather&nbsp; belatedly,&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is, almost five&nbsp; years after&nbsp; said&nbsp; co-defendants had&nbsp; filed&nbsp; their respective answers way&nbsp; back&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1949, the same year when petitioner himself filed&nbsp; his own&nbsp; answer. Even assuming that petitioner were in a position and&nbsp; had the&nbsp; right to ask for a bill of particulars, according to Rule 16, Section 1, he had only ten days after receiving copies&nbsp; of his co-defendants'&nbsp; answers&nbsp; to ask&nbsp; them to&nbsp; make&nbsp; more specific the allegations in their&nbsp; answers.&nbsp;&nbsp; No reason or&nbsp; explanation was given&nbsp; by petitioner why he&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to file his motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; particulars within those ten days, but instead&nbsp; allowed years&nbsp; to pass.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is, therefore,&nbsp; evident&nbsp; that the&nbsp; trial court was&nbsp; fully&nbsp; justified&nbsp; in setting aside its order granting petitioner's motion for&nbsp; a bill of particulars,&nbsp; specially upon being convinced that said order was improvidently&nbsp; issued on the erroneous&nbsp; assumption that respondents herein were duly notified of the hearing of the motion. <br><br>Coming to the denial of petitioner's motion before the trial court to strike from&nbsp; the record the pleadings signed by&nbsp; Atty. Domingo C.&nbsp; Sison,&nbsp; particularly, the&nbsp; motion for reconsideration,&nbsp; in behalf of the defendants-respondents, which led to the setting aside of the order of February 27, 1954, ordering the&nbsp; appointment of&nbsp; an&nbsp; administrator, petitioner&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that although Atty.&nbsp; Sison&nbsp; formerly represented the&nbsp; defendants, he had&nbsp; subsequently withdrawn his appearance&nbsp; for&nbsp; them;&nbsp; that&nbsp; at the time that he&nbsp; filed&nbsp; the&nbsp; pleadings&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; stricken from&nbsp; the record, Atty. Sison no longer represented&nbsp; the defendants; and that the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that he&nbsp; signed for Atty. Pio&nbsp; Duran, counsel&nbsp; for said&nbsp; defendants, did&nbsp; not&nbsp; make him&nbsp; (Sison) their&nbsp; attorney.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true that by signing the pleadings for Atty. Pio&nbsp; Duran, that did&nbsp; not&nbsp; make him an attorney for the&nbsp; said&nbsp; defendants, but we&nbsp; find nothing wrong in Atty. Sison&nbsp; signing&nbsp; for Atty. Duran&nbsp; if he&nbsp; was&nbsp; duly authorized to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so, which&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of evidence to the contrary,&nbsp; should be presumed, so that pleading may be&nbsp; regarded as&nbsp; having&nbsp; been filed&nbsp; by Atty.&nbsp; Duran&nbsp; and, therefore, valid. <br><br>Finally, petitioner claims&nbsp; that respondent Judge&nbsp; abused his discretion in denying petitioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings.&nbsp; The&nbsp; record,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; shows that judgment&nbsp; on&nbsp; the.pleadings at the time that&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; prayed for the same was not called for, for the reason that the answers filed by the defendants to the complaint tendered an&nbsp; issue as well as specifically&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the material allegations&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; For&nbsp; instance,&nbsp; while&nbsp; the complaint alleged&nbsp; that&nbsp; Albina&nbsp; Garcia&nbsp; and&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; Garcia were natural children of Hilaria Pordesimo by an unknown father, the answer stated that&nbsp; they were natural children of both&nbsp; Martin Garcia&nbsp; and Hilaria Pordesimo and were legitimated by their subsequent marriage; and as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the allegation in the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; that the properties, real and personal, left by Martin Garcia were still owned in common because,&nbsp; although&nbsp; they were in the possession&nbsp; of Pedro Pordesimo alias Juan&nbsp; Garcia, the latter was&nbsp; merely holding them in trust for his co-heirs, the answer&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; stated that there had been&nbsp; no&nbsp; such trusteeship, but that&nbsp; in the year 191.2,&nbsp; by means of an extrajudicial deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; partition,&nbsp; all&nbsp; said properties had&nbsp; been duly divided and allocated&nbsp; among all the heirs, including the widow Hilaria Pordesimo&nbsp; and the petitioner&nbsp; himself,&nbsp; Ciriaco&nbsp; Garcia.<br><br>We deem it unnecessary to touch&nbsp; upon and discuss the other points raised in&nbsp; the petition. <br><br>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing&nbsp; and&nbsp; finding&nbsp; the petition for certiorari and mandamus to be without merit, the same is hereby denied, with costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
