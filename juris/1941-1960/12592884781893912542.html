				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Remedios&nbsp; Sian&nbsp; Villanueva&nbsp; and&nbsp; Eusebio&nbsp; Villanueva, spouses,&nbsp; are the owners of&nbsp; four apartment houses for rent situated in Iloilo City, to wit: the first&nbsp; house consists of&nbsp; 11&nbsp; apartments situated at the corner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Iznart and Aldeguer Sts.; the second consists of 14 apartments situated at Aldeguer St.; the third consists of 7 apartments situated at the&nbsp; corner of Aldeguer and J. M.&nbsp; Basa&nbsp; Sts.;&nbsp; and the fourth&nbsp; consists&nbsp; of&nbsp; 2 apartments situated&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; same place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each apartment is occupied by one family and the food for each&nbsp; is cooked therein.<br><br>On September 30, 1946,&nbsp; the Municipal Board&nbsp; of&nbsp; Iloilo City enacted Ordinance No. 86,&nbsp; amending Ordinance No. 33, wherein the following&nbsp; was&nbsp; provided: (1)&nbsp; tenement house&nbsp; (casa de&nbsp; vecindad),&nbsp; P25 annually; (2)&nbsp; tenement house partly or wholly engaged in or dedicated to business in the streets of J.&nbsp; M. Basa, Iznart and Aldeguer, P24 per&nbsp; apartment;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; tenement&nbsp; house partly or wholly engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; business&nbsp; in&nbsp; any&nbsp; other streets, P12.00 per apartment.<br><br>Pursuant to Ordinance&nbsp; No. 86, the city sought to collect from the&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; an annual&nbsp; license&nbsp; tax&nbsp; fee&nbsp; of P24 for&nbsp; each of their 34 apartments,&nbsp; or the total&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P1,610 allegedly&nbsp; due during the period&nbsp; from the fourth quarter&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1946 to the third quarter of 1948,&nbsp; plus the sum of&nbsp; P332&nbsp; representing 20%&nbsp; penalty.&nbsp; The&nbsp; spouses having refused&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the same, the City of Iloilo filed in the municipal court an&nbsp; action to recover&nbsp; the tax and penalty above-mentioned.<br><br>Defendant spouses answered the complaint contending that the ordinance under&nbsp; which&nbsp; the tax&nbsp; is&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to be collected infringes&nbsp; the&nbsp; powers&nbsp; granted&nbsp; to&nbsp; the city by its Charter&nbsp; and that said ordinance is violative&nbsp; of the constitutional provision requiring uniformity of taxation upon&nbsp; the theory that it is oppressive, unreasonable and discriminatory.&nbsp; Because of the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; of&nbsp; constitutionality raised,&nbsp; the case was&nbsp; elevated&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Iloilo.<br><br>Counsel for both parties submitted a stipulation of&nbsp; facts, which was&nbsp; supplemented by an oral admission&nbsp; of&nbsp; other facts in&nbsp; open court.&nbsp; Thereafter, the court rendered&nbsp; judgment upholding the legality of the ordinance and ordering defendants&nbsp; to pay the taxes claimed, with&nbsp; interest and costs.&nbsp; Defendants&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; this&nbsp; decision to the Court&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp; but this case&nbsp; was&nbsp; elevated&nbsp; to this Court because it involves only questions of law.<br><br>It is&nbsp; clear from the&nbsp; Charter of Iloilo City that its municipal board is given the power to&nbsp; impose a license fee upon the owner of any business or occupation established&nbsp; in&nbsp; the city in the&nbsp; exercise of&nbsp; its police power. This is clearly inferred from paragraph (cc), section 21, of the Charter&nbsp; (C.A. No. 158), which&nbsp; provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; the municipal board has the express power&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; to&nbsp; regulate any business&nbsp; or occupation, and (b) to&nbsp; require&nbsp; licenses from persons engaged in such&nbsp; business or occupation in the city.&nbsp; But in fixing the fee that may be exacted, it becomes important to determine its nature and purpose to ascertain whether the power thus conferred has been properly exercised.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; this&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; it&nbsp; becomes&nbsp; equally important to&nbsp; bear in mind if the&nbsp; fee&nbsp; is&nbsp; imposed either as&nbsp; a police regulation or purely as a&nbsp; revenue measure, for the rules that govern its validity are different.&nbsp; Thus, it has been held that "License fees&nbsp; for revenue rest upon the taxing power as&nbsp; distinguished from the police power, and the power of the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; to&nbsp; exact such&nbsp; fees must be expressly granted by&nbsp; charter&nbsp; or statute and is not to&nbsp; be&nbsp; implied from&nbsp; the conferred power to license and regulate merely"&nbsp; (Cu Unjieng&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Patstone,&nbsp; 42 Phil., 818).<br><br>It is therefore imperative to determine&nbsp; when a license fee is&nbsp; charged merely&nbsp; for purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; regulation&nbsp; and when&nbsp; for purposes&nbsp; of&nbsp; revenue in order to&nbsp; see if&nbsp; the power has been exercised within the scope of the express powers granted by the law or statute.&nbsp; One test formulated by the authorities to attain this objectives is the following: "If the fee is designed to raise substantially more than the cost of the regulation to which it purports to be&nbsp; an incident, its&nbsp; purpose is to&nbsp; raise revenue.&nbsp; If it&nbsp; is a fee attached to&nbsp; a&nbsp; particular provision for&nbsp; regulation,&nbsp; and appears to be imposed to cover the cost of that regulation, and does substantially only&nbsp; that, then&nbsp; it is merely&nbsp; for the&nbsp; cost-paying&nbsp; part of a regulatory measure"&nbsp; (Carter <i>vs.</i> State Tax Commission, 126&nbsp; A.L.R., 1402).<br><br>This Court has also had occasion to lay down certain rules for determining the nature of the license fees that may be imposed on the business or occupation&nbsp; that may be&nbsp; established in a&nbsp; given&nbsp; place,&nbsp; and&nbsp; so that&nbsp; the same may&nbsp; guide us in&nbsp; drawing the&nbsp; demarcation line&nbsp; in&nbsp; the exercise of the power one way or the other,&nbsp; we will quote hereunder the portions we consider pertinent:<br><blockquote>"(1) The first two of&nbsp; these classes is&nbsp; based on the&nbsp; exercise of the police power and, though there is some conflict of authority on this point, the better rule seems to be that^the conferred power to regulate and to issue&nbsp; such&nbsp; licenses carries with it the right to fix&nbsp; a license fee.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is well&nbsp; settled&nbsp; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence of special authority to impose a&nbsp; tax for revenue the fee for&nbsp; this class of licenses may only be&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; amount to&nbsp; include the expense of issuing the license&nbsp; and the&nbsp; cost of the necessary expense&nbsp; of direct&nbsp; regulation but also incidental consequences.<br><br>"(3)&nbsp; The fee in the third class of&nbsp; cases,&nbsp; those for revenue purposes, is, perhaps, not a&nbsp; license fee&nbsp; properly speaking&nbsp; but&nbsp; is generally so termed.&nbsp; It rest upon the taxing power as distinguished from the&nbsp; police&nbsp; power,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; power of the municipality&nbsp; to exact such fees must be expressly granted by charter or statute and is&nbsp; not to be implied from the conferred power&nbsp; to license and regulate merely."&nbsp; (Cu Unjieng <i>vs.</i> Patstone, supra.)<br></blockquote>It can therefore be said that&nbsp; in order&nbsp; that&nbsp; a license fee may be considered&nbsp; merely as a&nbsp; regulatory measure, it must be&nbsp; only "of&nbsp; a sufficient amount to include the expenses of issuing the license and the cost of the necessary inspection or police surveillance,&nbsp; taking into&nbsp; account not only the expense of&nbsp; direct regulation but also incidental consequences."&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp; the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; if the&nbsp; fee&nbsp; charged is a revenue measure, the power&nbsp; to exact&nbsp; such fee "must be&nbsp; expressly granted by charter or&nbsp; statute and is&nbsp; not to be&nbsp; implied from the&nbsp; conferred&nbsp; power to license&nbsp; and regulate&nbsp; merely."<br><br>A cursory reading of&nbsp; the&nbsp; ordinance in question would at once reveal that the&nbsp; license fees&nbsp; charged therein are not merely&nbsp; for regulation but for revenue,&nbsp; because the fee of P24 <i>per&nbsp; annum</i>&nbsp; charged therein for every apartment&nbsp; far exceeds "the expense&nbsp; of&nbsp; issuing the&nbsp; license", plus "the cost of inspection&nbsp; or&nbsp; police surveillance",&nbsp; and other incidental expenses.&nbsp; Thus, for the first house which consists of 11&nbsp; apartments, the defendants would have to pay a&nbsp; license&nbsp; fee&nbsp; of&nbsp; P264&nbsp; annually;&nbsp; for the&nbsp; second house which consists&nbsp; of 14&nbsp; apartments, the fee would be&nbsp; P308 annually; for&nbsp; the third house which consists of&nbsp; 14 apartments,&nbsp; the fee&nbsp; would be&nbsp; P308 annually; for the third house which consists of 7 apartments, and the fourth which consists&nbsp; of 2&nbsp; apartments, the fee&nbsp; would be P216&nbsp; annually.&nbsp; All in&nbsp; all,&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; would&nbsp; have to pay a license&nbsp; tax fee&nbsp; amounting&nbsp; to P888&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">per annum</span>. This, in addition to the fees that may be exacted from many other residents similarly situated,&nbsp; would&nbsp; constitute a sizeable sum&nbsp; of revenue which would engross the coffers of the City.&nbsp; These fees&nbsp; cannot therefore&nbsp; be considered as merely for regulation purposes as contended.<br><br>It is however claimed that even if&nbsp; the fees exacted in the ordinance be considered as taxes for purposes of revenue still their exaction may be justified because the same comes within the&nbsp; power granted to the city by its Charter.&nbsp; And in that advocacy the city invokes section&nbsp; 21, paragraph j, of the Charter, which gives the&nbsp; city the power&nbsp; "To&nbsp; tax, fix&nbsp; the&nbsp; license fee&nbsp; for,&nbsp; and regulate&nbsp; hotels,&nbsp; restaurants, refreshment&nbsp; parlors,&nbsp; cafes,&nbsp; lodging&nbsp; houses,&nbsp;&nbsp; boarding houses,&nbsp; livery&nbsp; garages, public&nbsp; warehouses,&nbsp; pawnshops, theaters, cinematographs."&nbsp;&nbsp; The city claims that a tenement house can&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered as one belonging to the group of&nbsp; hotels,&nbsp; lodging houses,&nbsp; or&nbsp; boarding houses therein enumerated.<br><br>We disagree. As may be&nbsp; seen from the definition of each establishment hereunder quoted, a tenement house is different from&nbsp; a hotel, lodging house, or&nbsp; boarding house. These are different business enterprises.&nbsp; They have&nbsp; been established for different purposes.&nbsp; And it is preposterous to contend that a tenement house may be considered as included in the clause&nbsp; "other&nbsp; establishments&nbsp;&nbsp; likely to endanger public safety&nbsp; or&nbsp; give&nbsp; rise&nbsp; to&nbsp; conflagration or explosions" mentioned&nbsp; in the Charter, for as&nbsp; to&nbsp; them the power given&nbsp; to the&nbsp; city&nbsp; is merely to&nbsp; fix&nbsp; their location to&nbsp; protect the safety of the public, and not&nbsp; to&nbsp; impose&nbsp; a license fee&nbsp; or tax.<br><blockquote>"A <span style="font-style: italic;">hotel </span>is a place for the accommodation of travelers with food and&nbsp; lodging."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Judell <i>vs.</i> Goldfield Realty&nbsp; Co., 108 P. 455, 457)<br><br>" 'Lodging houses' is the term applied to&nbsp; houses containing furnished apartments which are let out by the week&nbsp; or&nbsp; by&nbsp; the month, without meals, or with breakfast simply."&nbsp; (Cromwell <i>vs.</i> Stephens, N.Y., 2 Daly, 15, 25, 3 Abb. Prac. 26, 35, Cited in Vol. 25,&nbsp; Words and Phrases, p. 583)<br><br>"A <span style="font-style: italic;">boarding house</span>&nbsp; is not in common parlance1 or in&nbsp; legal meaning, every private house&nbsp; where one or more boarders are&nbsp; kept occasionally only and upon special considerations.&nbsp; But&nbsp; it&nbsp; is a&nbsp; quasi-public house, where&nbsp; boarders&nbsp; are generally and&nbsp; habitually kept, and which is held out and known as a&nbsp; place of entertainment of that kind."&nbsp; (Cady <i>vs.</i> Mcdowell, 1 Lans. N.Y. 486, State <i>vs.</i> MacRae 170&nbsp; N.C.&nbsp; 712, 86 S.E.,&nbsp; 1039;&nbsp; Friedrich Music House&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Harris, 200 Mich.&nbsp; 421, 166 N. W. 869 L.R.A. 1918D, 400.)<br><br>"A<span style="font-style: italic;"> tenement&nbsp; house</span> is any house or building, or portion thereof, which is&nbsp; rented,&nbsp; leased, let, or hired&nbsp; out&nbsp; to be occupied,&nbsp; or is occupied,&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; home&nbsp; or residence of&nbsp; three&nbsp; families or&nbsp; more living independently of each other and&nbsp; doing&nbsp; their cooking&nbsp; in the premises,&nbsp; or by more than two families upon any floor, so&nbsp; living and&nbsp; cooking,&nbsp; but&nbsp; having a common right in the halls, stairways, yards, water-closets,&nbsp; or privies,&nbsp; or&nbsp; some&nbsp; of&nbsp; them."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Webster's New&nbsp; International Dictionary,&nbsp; 2nd&nbsp; Ed., p. 2601.)<br></blockquote>It is well-settled that a&nbsp; municipal&nbsp; corporation, unlike. a sovereign state, is clothed&nbsp; with&nbsp; no inherent&nbsp; power of taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp; "The charter or&nbsp; statute&nbsp; must plainly show an intent&nbsp; to confer that power&nbsp; or the&nbsp; municipality&nbsp; cannot assume it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the power when granted is to be construed <i>strictissimi juris.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any doubt&nbsp; or&nbsp; ambiguity&nbsp; arising out of the term used in granting that power must be resolved against the municipality.&nbsp; Inferences, implications, deductions—all these—have&nbsp; no place in the interpretation of the&nbsp; taxing&nbsp; power of&nbsp; a municipal corporation." (Icard <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Baguio, 83 Phil., 870;&nbsp; 46 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; 11&nbsp; Sup., 320; Medina <i>vs.</i> City of Baguio, 91&nbsp; Phil., 854; 48 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., [11] 4769; Yu <i>vs.</i> City of Lipa, 99 Phil., 975; 54 Off. Gaz., [13] 4055.&nbsp; And it not appearing that the power to tax owners of tenement houses is one among those clearly and expressly granted to the City of Iloilo by its Charter, the exercise&nbsp; of such power cannot be assumed and hence the ordinance in question is <span style="font-style: italic;">ultra vires</span> insofar as it taxes a tenement house such as those belonging to defendants.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision&nbsp; appealed from is reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint is&nbsp; dismissed, without&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
