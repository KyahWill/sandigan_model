				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On September 13, 1931, Eulogia Antaso, a resident of Binangonan, Rizal, 
died. She was predeceased by her husband Mariano Aralar, and their two children, 
Maxima and Martina Aralar. Maxima was the mother of petitioners-appellants 
Adoracion, Jovenal and Porvenir, all surnamed Barretto, while Martina was the 
mother of plaintiffs Felimon and Cristina Cenido. Respondent-appellee Valentin 
Antazo was the cousin of Eulogia Antazo de Aralar.<p></p>
<p>On September 21, 1931, Valentin Antazo commenced Special Proceedings No. 
4915, of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, for the probate of a will of the 
deceased, Eulogia Antazo, distributing her property. Valentin Antazo was 
appointed administrator in the testate proceedings. All the herein appellants 
were minors at the time, but the Barrettos were represented by guardians <i>ad 
litem</i>. On January 14, 1932, the court approved the project of partition; and the 
administrator on October 21, 1936, asked the court with the heirs' consent to 
relieve him from accounting; to be authorized to cede two parcels of land to 
Mateo Celerian in payment of the obligations of the deceased (Exh. E-2); and for 
the closure of the proceedings. The motion was granted by the court on February 
13, 1937 (Exh. E-3).</p>
<p>On June 26, 1950, the grandchildren of Eulogia Antazo filed a motion in the 
testate proceedings to punish for contempt and remove administrator Antazo. 
Since the re constitution of the lost records of the testate case appeared 
impossible, the court suggested in an order, dated July 17, 1950, the filing of 
separate and independent actions. This resulted in the filing of Civil Cases 
Nos. 1160 and 1208 on July 17 and August 3, 1950, respectively.</p>
<p>In Civil Case No. 1160 (CA-G.R. No. 11719-R) against Valentin and Adriano 
Antazo, plaintiffs (grandchildren of Eulogia Antazo) urged the annulment of the 
project of partition submitted in the testate proceedings on the ground of fraud 
on the part of Valentin Antazo, as administrator, in asserting that the deceased 
Eulogia Antazo left no forced heirs, when she left grandchildren, and two of 
them, Felimon and Cristina Cenido were then minors; and sought recovery of three 
parcels described in paragraph 3 of their complaint, with damages and costs; 
and, in the even that the project of partition be declared valid, then 
plaintiffs pray for the partition of parcel (a), and the delivery of parcel (c), 
which was omitted in the project of partition. Valentin Antazo averred that 
parcel (a) was bequeathed by the deceased to him and his brother Adriano Antazo, 
pursuant to the order of the original owner ;and with respect to parcel (b), 
that it was delivered and transferred by him to Adriano Antazo, in the 
administration proceedings. As to parcel (c), the record discloses that this was 
adjudicated to the plaintiffs by the trial court in its judgment on the 
pleadings dated November 13, 1952. Anyway, Valentin Antazo claimed that he had 
never been in possession of this parcel of land in his capacity as administrator 
of the estate of Eulogia Antazo.</p>
<p>In Civil Case No. 1208-(CA-G. R. No. 11720-R), involving 14 parcels of land 
(including the three claimed in the other case) and a religious carriage locally 
know as a <u>trescaida</u>, allegedly belonging to the estate of the Aralar spouses, 
plaintiffs prayed for the value of the products of said lands, for the return of 
the <u>trescaida</u> and for damages. According to Valentin Antazo, parcels (e) and 
(g), the last being the same as parcel (c) in Civil Case No. 1160, have never 
come into his possession as administrator; that parcels (h) and (i) have been 
sold by him to Mateo F. Celerian, with the approval of the court, to satisfy all 
claims against the estate; and the remaining parcels of land have already been 
delivered to the legatees named in the will aid project of partition.</p>
<p>After a joint hearing of the cases, the Court of First Instance rendered 
judgment on February 26, 1953, and adjudicated parcel (c) of case No. 1160 to 
the plaintiffs, by a prior judgment for the pleadings; held that plaintiffs 
action accrued in 1931 and therefore barred by prescription and by the orders 
issued in the probate proceedings; and dismissed the actions, sentencing 
plaintiffs Barretto and Cenido to pay P2,000.00 damages to defendants.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which, after tearing, duly 
rendered a decision setting aside the award of damages to the defendants Antazo, 
but upholding the dismissal of the cases saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These three cases are essentially the offshoot of the testate proceedings. 
The project of partition was prepared strictly in accordance with the 
dispositions made in the will (Exhibits E and Q-1). Even the sale to Mateo 
Celerian of the parcels of land described under paragraphs 2 (h) and (i) of the 
complaint in Civil Case No. 1208, which are the same as parcels Nos. 9 and 10 in 
the will, for the satisfaction of all claims against Idle estate, was in 
conformity with the will. The termination of the proceedings by the probate 
court on February 13, 1937 (Exhibit E-3) meant that a final distribution of the 
estate of the testatrix was made and approved by the court. This final 
distribution vested title to the lands composing the estate in the distributees 
or legatees (Santos v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Nueva Caceres, 45 Phil. 893). 
Assuming that at least Cristina Cenido and Felimon Cenido were not duly 
represented in the testate proceedings, the evidence of record does not show 
that they have been left out in the partition and distribution to warrant a 
reopening of the probate proceedings and let another court or judge throw out a 
decision or order already final and executed (Ramos v. Ortuzar, G. R. No. 
L-3299, August 29, 1951). If the lands were not actually delivered to the 
respective legatees after the termination of the proceedings the cause of action 
accrued in February, 1947, when all the appellants have attained the age of 
majority because the youngest of them, Provenir Barretto, became of age in May 
1940. In Ramos v. Ramos, 45 Phil. 362, it was held that if the three-year saving 
clause in favor of a minor expires before the full ten-year prescriptive period 
has elapsed, prescription becomes effective at the expiration of the latter 
period. The law, said the Supreme Court in that, case, does not unconditionally 
give the period of three years in addition to the ten years allowed for 
prescription. It is clear therefore, that the causes of action of appellants 
have bees barred by prescription when the cases at bar were filed in 1950." 
(Petitioners' Brief, pp. 36-38)</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellants Barretto and Cenido then resorted to this Court, We granted 
certiorari. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In their brief, appellants make the following assignment of 
errors:<br><br>"1. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DECLARING THAT COURT CLOSED THE 
ADMINISTRATION ON FEBRUARY 13, 1937', WHEN IT ALSO SAID THAT 'ON FEBRUARY 24, 
1937, ADMINISTRATOR ANTAZO FILED A CONSTANCIA' WHICH SHOWS THAT ON SAID DATE OF 
FEB. 24, 1937, THE ADMINISTRATOR WAS JUST PRAYING THAT HE BE ORDERED TO DELIVER 
THE SHARE OF ADORACION BARRETTO, AND THE REFORE THE ADMINISTRATION PROCEEDINGS 
COULD NOT BE TERMINATED PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 24, 1937.</p>
<p>2. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT DECLARING THAT THESE CASES ARE GOVERNED 
BY ACT 3110, AND THAT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ACT 3110, SECTION 7. AN ORDER. OF 
PROBATE OF A WILL AND A FINAL ORDER OF TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE 
PROVED EXCEPT BY AN AUTHENTIC COPY THEREOF.</p>
<p>3. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT AWARDING THE WHOLE OF PARCEL (A) AND 
PARCEL (B) TO THE PLAINTIFFS, TOGETHER WITH THE HARVESTS THEREOF AT LEAST FROM 
1937 UP TO AND UNTIL THEY ARE DELIVERED TO THE PLAINTIFFS.</p>
<p>4. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT AWARDING MORAL DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS 
FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF P10.000,00 CLAIMED BY THE PLAINTIFFS FOR BAD FAITH AND 
FRAUDS COMMITTED BY DEFENDANT ADMINISTRATOR.</p>
<p>5. THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT AWARDING DAMAGES IN PAST HARVESTS IN 
FAVOR OF THE PETITIONERS AFTER THE LOWER COURT HAD RENDERED JUDGMENT ON THE 
PLEADINGS WHICH DECLARED THE PLAINTIFFS THE COMPLETE AND ABSOLUTE OWNERS OF 
PARCEL (C), WHICH PARCEL THE DEFENDANT ADRIANO ANTAZO CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN IN 
HIS POSSESSION 'SINCE 1918' UNTIL IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE PLAINTIFFS BY THE 
SHERIFF ON EXECUTION ISSUED BY THE TRIAL COURT, ON DEC. 19, 
1952."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first error raises a question of fact. The only reason advanced against 
the holding of the Court of Appeals that the administration of the estate of 
Eulogia Antazo was in fact closed by the order of February 13, 1937, is that on 
the 24th of said month, said Valentin Antazo as Administrator filed a motion 
(Exh, I) for the removal of Cirilo Barretto as guardian <i>ad litem</i> of his minor 
children (petitioners and appellants Barretto) and to authorize the 
Administrator to make delivery of her share to Adoracion Barretto herself, since 
she had already married and was released from her father's parental power. We do 
not believe that this motion contradicts the finding of the Court of Appeals, 
for obviously the motion concerned merely the execution of the project of 
partition, which was unquestionably passed upon and approved by the court on 
January 14, 1937 (Rec. App, pp. 25-26) and again on February 13, 1937 (Rec, App. 
p. 30), thus fixing the rights of the heirs and legatees as of the later 
date.</p>
<p>Anyway, whether the proceedings were or were not closed on February 13, 1937, 
there is no question that the order of approval of the project of partition had 
become final by that time, since ao appeal was interposed. Any right of the 
distributees accrued as of that date in conformity with the approved partition; 
and by 1950, when the present cases were instituted, it was too late to have the 
partition reviewed or altered. Even in the case of the heir Cristina Cenido, who 
did not become of age until July 8, 1939 (since according to Exh. M, she was 
born on July 8, 1918), it was too late for her in 1950 to reinvindicate any 
properties to which she might lay claim because she had allowed more than the 
ten-year maximum period of limitation (1939-1949) to elapse without asserting 
her rights.</p>
<p>The second assignment of error is untenable. Act 3110 applies to 
reconstitution of records of pending cases, and did not apply to the Estate of 
Eulogia Antazo, which the court had declared terminated as of 1937.</p>
<p>As to the third error, parcel (b) of case No. 1160 (CA-G.R. No. 11719-R) was 
adjudicated in the final partition to appellee Adriano Antazo. This adjudication 
was in strict conformity with paragraphs 11 and "e" of the will or the deceased 
(Exh. Q-1). More than ten years having elapsed during which Adriano was in 
possession of said land, appellants are barred from questioning either the 
adjudication to Adriano or his ownership thereof.</p>
<p>But as to parcel (a) (land in Mambalon, Binangonan, Rizal, covered by Tax 
Declaration No. 20867), we agree with appellants that it was error to dismiss 
their claim in toto. Valentin Antazo's averment that said parcel had been 
"devuelto, transferido y entregado absolutamente y a perpetuidad a dicho 
demandado y a su hermano Adriano Antazo por la finada Eulogia Antazo" (Rec. App. 
p. 35) is contradicted by his own evidence. Paragraph (g) of the testament provided the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"g. Que devuelvo, entrego y transfiero en absoluto y a perpetuidad a primos 
Adriano Antazo y Valentin Antazo la propiedad descrita en el numero 12 de este 
documento, porque la citada propiedad de dos balitas y media es de la propiedado 
del Santo (Tres Caidas) de acuerdo con el testamento otorgado por nuestro 
abuelo, Capitan Pedro Antazo el 31 de Diciembre de 1891; y la otra mitad 
restante, lego y dono en partes iguales, a mis nietas Adoracion Barretto y 
Cristina Cenido." (Rec. App. p.42)</p></blockquote>
<p>The property described in No. 12 of the testament is precisely parcel (a) of 
paragraph 3 of the complaint in case No. 1160; as can be seen, only one half was 
bequeathed to the brothers Antazo, while the other half was devised to the 
granddaughters of the testatrix. And this is confirmed by the prorject of 
partition submitted by Valentin Antazo himself, as Judicial Administrator; for 
it adjudicated to Adoracion Barretto "una cuarta (1/4) proindivisa" of said land 
(See. App. p. 20); to Cristina Cenido also an undivided fourth interest (Rec. 
App. p. 21); another fourth to Adriano Antazo (Rec. App. p.22); and a like 
interest to Valentin (Rec. App. p.23). Valentin Antazo is estopped, therefore, 
both by his own act and the court's decree, from denying that appellants 
Adoracion Barretto and Cristina Cenido have each a fourth interest in this land 
in Barrio Mambalon, Binangonan, Rizal, prewar Tax Declaration No. 20867, and 
that interest carries with it the right to partition and to a share in the 
fruits received by Valentin Antazo.</p>
<p>Adverse possession does not lie between coownesrs In the absence of express 
repudiation brought home to the other coovoiers (Laguna vs. Levantino, 71 Phil. 
566; Mallari vs. Sunga, G. R. No. L-5043, Dec. 17, 1952). None having been 
proved in this case, appellants' action for revindication, partition, and 
accounting of the fruits was erroneously dismissed.</p>
<p>We see no error in the refusal of the Court of Appeals to award moral damages 
(fourth assignment of error) to plaintiffs, it appearing that the partition was 
strictly in conformity with the testament of the deceased grandmother of the 
appellants, and that most of the prejudice allegedly suffered by them is either 
non-existent or attributable to their concurrent negligence to enforce their 
rights. Neither is there any showing that the legitimes of the grandchildren 
were impaired.</p>
<p>As to the fifth assignment of error, suffice it to observe that the Court of 
First Instance awarded parcel (c) of the complaint in Case No. 1160, to herein 
appellants by a judgment on the pleadings on November 13, 1952, but refrained 
from making any pronouncement on the harvests thereof; yet the appellants 
acquiesced therein, and did not protest or prosecute an appeal from that award. 
The same having become final, appellants have only themselves to for the 
incomplete relief granted.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the judgment appealed from is modified by declaring 
each one of appellants, Adoracion Barretto and Cristina Cenido, the owner of an 
undivided fourth of the land described paragraph 3(a) of the complaint in case 
No. 1160 of the Court First Instance of Rizal, and ordering the records remanded 
to said court for further proceedings regarding partition of the property and 
accounting and distribution of its fruits from and after 1937, by appellee 
Valentin Antazo, In all other respects, said decision is affirmed. No costs.
