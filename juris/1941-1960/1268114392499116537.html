				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">As assignee of a right of action arising from due and unpaid&nbsp; wages and those for&nbsp; overtime, as&nbsp; provided for in Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 444,&nbsp; earned by Julio&nbsp; Carlos who had worked as latheman for the defendant, a limited partnership, from 16 November 1949 to 21 March 1952 when he&nbsp; died, leaving&nbsp; as only heirs&nbsp; his parents&nbsp; named Lazaro Carlos and Candida Reyes who, for valuable consideration, assigned their right, the plaintiff brought this action in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; against the defendant to recover such due and unpaid wages and those for&nbsp; overtime amounting to P1,952.55, lawful interest therein from&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing of&nbsp; the complaint, the defendant having refused to pay it despite demand, and 10%&nbsp; thereof as attorney's&nbsp; fees, whose services the&nbsp; plaintiff had been compelled to engage, and costs.<p>After filing. an&nbsp; answer with a counterclaim, the defendant moved for the dismissal of the complaint&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that as the&nbsp; amount of money sought to&nbsp; be recovered was Pl,952.55 only, the Court had no jurisdiction to hear&nbsp; and decide the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 22 June 1955 the Court dismissed&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint relying upon the case of Rosario <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Carandang, 51&nbsp; Off. Gaz. 2387,&nbsp; where it was&nbsp; stated that "costs&nbsp; and attorney's fees are&nbsp; excluded from the jurisdictional amount that confers&nbsp; jurisdiction upon courts * *&nbsp; * On 9 July 1955 the motion&nbsp; for reconsideration filed by the plaintiff was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp; He&nbsp; appealed.</p><p>The action brought in the case just mentioned was one of forcible entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; jurisdiction of the courts&nbsp; in&nbsp; such cases is determined by&nbsp; the nature of the action and not by&nbsp; the amount of money&nbsp; sought to&nbsp; be recovered which may&nbsp; exceed P2,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; So,&nbsp; any statement or&nbsp; proposition that may have been made in the case referred to which was not necessary for the determination of the controversy involved in the action is <em>obiter dictum</em>.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 88, Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 296,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; provides that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; determination of the jurisdictional amount only interest&nbsp; and&nbsp; costs shall&nbsp; be excluded from the amount of money sought to be recovered&nbsp; in&nbsp; an&nbsp; action where the remedy prayed for&nbsp; is recovery of a sum of money.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in Teresa Vda. de Rosario <em>vs</em>. Justice&nbsp; of the Peace of Camiling, Tarlac, et al, (99 Phil.,&nbsp; 693) this Court&nbsp; held that-&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>While some doubt&nbsp; had&nbsp; arisen in the past as to whether the jurisdiction&nbsp; of a court depends, in cases where several claims&nbsp; or causes&nbsp; of action between&nbsp; the&nbsp; same parties are&nbsp; embodied&nbsp; in&nbsp; a single complaint, on the amount of each single claim or&nbsp; upon the totality of the demand in&nbsp; all the causes of action, we have finally held in the cases of&nbsp; Soriano <em>vs</em>. Omila,&nbsp; 51 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; (No.&nbsp; 7)&nbsp; p. 3465, and Campos Rueda. Corporation <em>vs</em>. Sta. Cruz Timber Co. Inc. (52 Off. Gaz., (No. 3) p.&nbsp; 1387), that the jurisdiction of the court depends <em>upon the totality of the demand in&nbsp; all the causes of action,</em> irrespective&nbsp; of&nbsp; whether the plural&nbsp; causes constituting the total claim&nbsp; arose out of&nbsp; the same or different&nbsp; transactions.&nbsp; The only exceptions to this rule are (1) where the&nbsp; claims joined under the same&nbsp; complaints are&nbsp; separately&nbsp; owed by,&nbsp; or&nbsp; due&nbsp; to,&nbsp; different parties, in which case each separate claim furnishes the jurisdictional test (Argonza, et al. <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; International Colleges,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-3884, November&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1951; Soriano y&nbsp; Cia. <em>vs</em>. Jose, 47&nbsp; Off. Gaz. (12 Supp.), p. 156); and&nbsp; (2) where not all the causes of action joined are demands or claims for money.</p></blockquote><p>Section 3, Commonwealth Act No. 444, grants&nbsp; additional or overtime compensation to laborers working beyond the eight-hour period provided for by law.&nbsp; And article&nbsp; 2208 of the new Civil Code provides that attorney's fees may be recovered in actions for the recovery of wages of laborers and skilled workers.&nbsp; Adding 10% to the amount&nbsp; claimed by the&nbsp; plaintiff for wages and&nbsp; overtime&nbsp; the&nbsp; total sum sought to be&nbsp; recovered is&nbsp; within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance.</p><p>The orders&nbsp; appealed from dismissing the complaint and denying the motion for reconsideration&nbsp; are set aside and the case remanded to the court&nbsp; below for further proceedings in&nbsp; accordance with law.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
