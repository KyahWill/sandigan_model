				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On  September 8,  1958, J. M.  Tuason &amp; Co.,  Inc. filed an action for ejectment against  Guillermo Renosa  before the Court  of  First Instance of  Quezon City where, after issues  were joined, judgment was rendered ordering defendant to surrender the possession of the land to plaintiff, to remove the building he has erected thereon, and pay a  rental  of  P12.00 a month  from February 6, 1957 until the property 13  restored.</p>
<p>Defendant received a copy of  the decision on  May 11, 1959.  On June  10,  1959, defendant  filed a  motion for reconsideration  which was  denied.  Copy of  the order denying the motion was  received by defendant  on September 7, 1959.  On  September 8, 1959, the last day for perfecting the appeal, defendant filed a motion asking for five days extension within which to file his record on appeal, at the  same time filing his notice  of appeal and tendering to the clerk of  court  the sum of  P60.00  as appeal bond as required by the rules, but as the money so tendered was short of P0.30 representing  the commission fee which according to the clerk of court should also be paid, said clerk of court declined to receive the money telling the messenger to come back the next day bringing  with him  the complete amount  of  P60.30.  So the messenger returned the following day, September 9, 1959, bringing with him  a check  dated September 8, 1959, for the  sum of P60.30, which  was then received by the clerk of court for  which an official  receipt was issued.  On September 10, 1959, the court granted the motion for extension filed by defendant, and on September 11, 1959 defendant filed his record on appeal.  On  September  21,  1959, plaintiff filed  his opposition to the approval of the record on appeal on  the ground that defendant failed to perfect his appeal within the reglementary period, which opposition the  trial court entertained,  it having found that the notice of appeal and the appeal bond had been filed on September 9, 1959, or one day late.  Defendant filed a motion for reconsideration,  which was  denied.  Hence the present petition  for mandamus.</p>
<p>We find merit in the petition.   The record shows that the last day within which defendant may perfect his appeal is September 8, 1959 and on this date he sent a messenger to the clerk of  court bringing wjth him a notice of appeal, the amount of  P60.00 as <em>cash</em> appeal bond, and an urgent motion for extension of time  to file the record  on appeal. The record also shows that after  the  clerk  of court  had affixed the seal of hi3 office on the notice of appeal indicating that it was filed on  September 8, 1959,  he returned said notice with the sum of P60.00 tendered to him by the messenger for  the reason that said amount  was short of P0.30 telling him to return the next day bringing with him the same notice of appeal and the amount of P60.30.  The messenger complied  with the  instruction  by returning the next  day,  September 9, 1959, with a cheek  bearing date of September 8,  1959 in  the amount of P60.30.   And because the appeal bond was apparently filed one day late, the trial court, sustaining the opposition of plaintiff, dismissed the appeal as having been  perfected outside of the reglementary period.</p>
<p>We  find the  action  of the trial court to  be improper under the circumstances.  In the  first place, Section 5, Rule  41 prescribes that the appeal bond in appeals from a  decision of the court of first  instance  is  only P60.00 unless the court fixes a different  amount.  The rule  does not require any commission to be paid, and  even if this be  so, the  fact is  that  defendant has  actually tendered          the appeal bond of P60.00 on  time but that the  clerk  of        court erroneously  returned  the money simply because it         was short  of  P0.30.  The proper step for the clerk  of        court to have  taken was to retain the  P60.00, issue  an          official receipt  therefor,  and ask  the  messenger  to complete the same with an additional P0.30.  This additional          amount is  not  part of the bond,  The mistake therefore,          if any, was committed  by the clerk of court and the same cannot be blamed  on defendant.   At any rate, it  may  be         said that defendant has  substantially  complied  with  the requirement of the rule relative to the filing of an appeal bond, and so it was error to dismiss the appeal (Contreras vs. Dinglasan, 79 Phil., 42; 45  Off.  Gaz., 257).</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is granted.   The trial court is  ordered to give  due course to the  appeal.  No pronouncement as  to costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
