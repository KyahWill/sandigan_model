				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July 14, 1960, Congressman Sergio Osmeña, Jr., submitted to this Court a 
verified petition for "declaratory relief, certiorari and prohibition with 
preliminary injunction" against Congressman Salipada K. Pendatun and fourteen 
other congressmen in their capacity as members of the Special Committee created 
by House Resolution No. 59. He asked for annulment of such Resolution on the 
ground of infringement of his parliamentary immunity; he also asked, 
principally, that said members of the special committee be enjoined from 
proceeding in accordance with it, particularly the portion authorizing them to 
require him to substantiate his charges against the President, with the 
admonition that if he failed to do so, he must show cause why the House, should 
not punish him.
<p>The petition attached a copy of House Resolution No. 59, the pertinent 
portions of which read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas, on the 23rd day of June, 1960, the Honorable Sergio Osmeña, Jr., 
Member of the House of Representatives from the Second District of "the province 
of Cebu, took the floor of this Chamber on the one hour privilege to deliver a 
speech, entitled A Message to Garcia;'</p>
<p>Whereas, in the course of said speech, the Congressman from the Second 
District of Cebu stated the following:</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>"The people, Mr. President, have been hearing of ugly reports that under your 
unpopular administration the free things they used to get from the government 
are now for sale at premium prices. They say that even pardons are for sale, and 
that regardless of the gravity or seriousness of a criminal case, the culprit 
can always be bailed out forever from jail as long as he can come across with a 
handsome dole. I am afraid, such an anomalous situation would reflect badly on 
the kind of justice that your administration is dispensing. * * *."</p>
<p>Whereas, the charges of the gentleman from the Second District of Cebu, if 
made maliciously or recklessly and without.basis in truth and in fact, would 
constitute a serious assault upon the dignity and prestige of the Office of the 
President, which is the one visible symbol of the sovereignty of the Filipino 
people, and would expose said office to contempt and disrepute; * * *</p>
<p><em>Resolved by the House of Representatives</em>, that a special committee 
of fifteen Members to be appointed by the Speaker be, and the same hereby is, 
created to investigate the truth of the charges against the President of the 
Philippines made by Honorable Sergio Osmeña, Jr., in his privilege speech of 
June 23, 1960, and for such purpose it is authorized to summon Honorable Sergio 
Osmeña, Jr., to appear before it to substantiate his charges, as well as to 
issue <em>subpoena</em> and/or <em>subpoena duces tecum</em> to require the 
attendance of witnesses and/or the production of pertinent papers before it, and 
if Honorable Sergio Osmeña, Jr., fails to do so to require him to show cause why 
he should not be punished by the House.- The special committee shall submit to 
the House a report of its findings and recommendations before the adjournment of 
the present special session of the Congress of the 
Philippines."</p></blockquote>
<p>In support of his request, Congressman Osmeña alleged r first, the Resolution 
violated his constitutional absolute parliamentary immunity for speeches 
delivered in the House; second, his words constituted no actionable conduct; and 
third, after his allegedly objectionable speech and words, the House took up 
other business, and Rule XVII, sec. 7 of the Rules of the House provides that if 
other business has intervened after the Member had uttered obnoxious words in 
debate, <em>he shall not be held</em> to answer therefor nor be subject to 
censure by the House.</p>
<p>Although some members of the court expressed doubts of petitioner's cause of 
action and the Court's jurisdiction, the majority decided to hear the matter 
further, and required respondents to answer without issuing any preliminary 
injunction. Evidently aware of such circumstance with its implications, and 
pressed for time in view of the imminent adjournment of the legislative session, 
the special committee continued to perform its task, and after giving 
Congressman Osmeña a chance to defend himself, submitted its report on July 
18,1960, finding said congressman guilty of serious disorderly behaviour; and 
acting on such report, the House approved on the same day-before closing its 
session-House Resolution No. 175, declaring him guilty as recommended, and 
suspending him from office for fifteen months. </p>
<p>Thereafter, on July 19, 1960, the respondents (with the exception of 
Congressmen De Pio, Abeleda, San Andres Ziga, Fernandez and Baltao)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed their answer, challenged the 
jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the petition, defended the power of 
Congress to discipline its members with suspension, upheld House Resolution No. 
175 and then invited attention to the fact that Congress having ended its 
session on July 18,1960, the Committee-whose members are the sole 
respondents-had thereby ceased to exist.</p>
<p>There is no question that Congressman Osmeña, in a privilege speech delivered 
before the House, made the serious imputations of bribery against the President 
which are quoted in Resolution No. 59, and that he refused to produce before the 
House Committee created for the purpose, evidence to substantiate such 
imputations. There is also no question that for having made the imputations and 
for failing to produce evidence in support thereof, he was, by resolution of the 
House, suspended from office for a period of fifteen months, for serious 
diorderly behaviour.</p>
<p>Resolution No. 175 states in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas, the Special Committee created under and by virtue of Resolution No. 
59, adopted on July 8, 1960, found Representative Sergio Osmeña, Jr., guilty of 
serious diorderly behaviour for making without basis in truth and in fact, 
scurrilous, malicious, reckless and irresponsible charges against the President 
of the Philippines in his privilege speech of June 23, 1960; and</p>
<p>Whereas, the said charges are so vile in character that they affronted and 
degraded the dignity of the House of Representatives: Now, Therefore, be it</p>
<p>Resolved by the House of Representatives, That Representative Sergio Osmeña, 
Jr., be, as he hereby is, declared guilty of serious disorderly behaviour; and * 
* *."</p></blockquote>
<p>As previously stated, Osmeña contended in his petition that: (1) the 
Constitution gave him complete parliamentary immunity, and so, for words spoken 
in the House, he ought not to be questioned; (2) that his speech constituted no 
disorderly behaviour for which he could be punished; and (3) supposing he could 
be questioned and disciplined therefor, the House had lost the power to do so 
because it had taken up other business before approving House Resolution No. 59. 
Now, he takes the additional position (4) that the House has no power, under the 
Constitution, to suspend one of its members.</p>
<p>Section 15, Article VI of our Constitution provides that "for any speech or 
debate" in Congress, the Senators or Members of the House of Representatives 
"shall not be questioned in any other place." This section was taken or is a 
copy of sec. 6, clause 1 of Art. 1 of the Constitution of the United States. In 
that country, the provision has always been understood to mean that although 
exempt from prosecution or civil actions for their words uttered in Congress, 
the members of Congress may, nevertheless, be questioned <em>in Congress 
itself</em>. Observe that "they shall not be questioned in any <em>other</em> 
place" than Congress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Rules of the House which petitioner himself has invoked 
(Rule XVII, sec. 7), recognize the House's power to hold a member responsible 
"for words spoken in debate."</p>
<p>Our Constitution enshrines parliamentary immunity which is a fundamental 
privilege cherished in every legislative assembly of the democratic world. As 
old as the English Parliament, its purpose "is to enable and encourage a 
representative of the public to discharge his public trust with firmness and 
success" for "it is indispensably necessary that he should enjoy the fullest 
liberty of speech, and that he should be protected from the resentment of every 
one, however powerful, to whom the exercise of that liberty may occasion 
offense." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>Such immunity has come to 
this country from the practices of Parliament as construed and applied by the 
Congress of the United States. Its extent and application remain no longer in 
doubt in so far as related to the question before us. It guarantees the 
legislator complete freedom of expression without fear of being made responsible 
in criminal or civil actions before the courts or any other forum 
<em>outside</em> of the Congressional Hall. But it does not protect him from 
responsibility before ttye legislative body itself whenever his words and 
conduct are considered by the latter disorderly or unbecoming a member thereof. 
In the United States Congress, Congressman Fernando Wood of New York was 
censured for using the following language on the floor of the House: "A 
monstrosity, a measure the most infamous of the many infamous acts of the 
infamous Congress." (Hinds' Precedents, Vol. 2, pp. 798-799). Two other 
congressmen were censured for employing insulting words during debate. (2 Hinds' 
Precedents, 799-801). In one case, a member of Congress was summoned to testify 
on a statement made by him in debate, but invoked his parliamentary privilege. 
The Committee rejected his plea. (3 Hinds' Precedents 123-124.)</p>
<p>For unparliamentary conduct, members of Parliament or of Congress have been, 
or could be censured, committed to prison<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>, suspended, even expelled by the votes of 
their colleagues. The appendix to this decision amply attests to the consensus 
of informed opinion regarding the practice and the traditional power of 
legislative assemblies to take disciplinary action against its members, 
<em>including imprisonment, suspension or expulsion</em>. It mentions one 
instance of suspension of a legislator in a foreign country.</p>
<p>And to cite a local illustration, the Philippine Senate, in April 1949, 
suspended a senator for one year.</p>
<p>Needless to add, the Rules of Philippine House of Representatives provide 
that the parliamentary practices of the Congress of the United States shall 
apply in a supplementary manner to its proceedings.</p>
<p>This brings up the third point of petitioner: the House may no longer take 
action against me, he argues, because after my speech, and before approving 
Resolution No. 59, it had taken up other business. Respondents answer that 
Resolution No. 59 was unanimously approved by the House, that such approval 
amounted to a suspension of the House Rules, which according to standard 
parliamentary practice may be done by unanimous consent. .</p>
<p>Granted, counters the petitioner, that the House may suspend the operation of 
its Rules, it may not, however, affect past acts or renew its right to take 
action which had already lapsed.</p>
<p>The situation might thus be compared to laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> extending the period of limitation of 
actions and making them applicable to actions that had lapsed. The Supreme Court 
of the United States has upheld such laws as against the contention that they 
impaired vested rights in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Campbell 
<em>vs</em>. Holt, 115 U. S. 620). The states hold divergent views. At any rate, 
courts have declared that "the rules adopted by deliberative bodies are subject 
to revocation modification or waiver at the pleasure of the body adopting 
them,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>And it been said that 
"Parliamentary rules are merely procedural, and with, their observance, the 
courts have no concern. They may be waived or disregarded by the legislative 
body." Consequently, "mere failure to conform to parliamentary usage will not 
invalidate the action (taken by a deliberative body) when the requisite number 
of members have agreed to a particular measure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p>The following is quoted from a reported decision of the Supreme Court of 
Tennessee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The rule here invoked is one of parliamentary procedure, and it is uniformly 
held that it is within the power of all deliberative bodies to abolish, modify, 
or waive their own rules of procedure, adopted for the orderly conduct of 
business, and as security against hasty action." (Bewiet <em>vs</em>. New 
Bedford, 110 Mass, 433; Holt <em>vs</em>. Somerville, 127 Mass. 408, 411; City 
of Sadalia <em>vs</em>. Scott, 104 Mo. App. 595, 78 S. W. 276; Ex parte Mayor, 
etc, of Albany, 23 Wend. CN.Y.] 277, 280 j Wheelock <em>vs</em>. City of Lowell,

of Corinth <em>vs</em>. Sharp, 107 Miss. 696, 65 So. 888; McGraw <em>vs</em>.

145 Ky. 181, 186, 140 S. W. 159, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 802.) [Taken from the case of 
Rutherford <em>vs</em>. City of Nashville, 78 South Western Reporter, p. 
584.]</p></blockquote>
<p>It may be noted in this connection, that in the case of Congressman Stanbery 
of Ohio, who insulted the Speaker, for which Act a resolution of censure was 
presented, the House approved the resolution, despite the argument that other 
business had intervened after the objectionable remarks. (2 Hinds' Precedents 
pp. 799-800.)</p>
<p>On the question whether delivery of speeches attacking the Chief Executive 
constitutes disorderly conduct for which Osmeña may be disciplined, many 
arguments pro and con have been advanced. We believe, however, that the House is 
the judge of what constitutes disorderly behaviour, not only because the 
Constitution has conferred jurisdiction upon it, but also because the matter 
depends mainly on factual circumstances of which the House knows best but which 
can not be depicted in black and white for presentation to, and adjudication by 
the Courts. For one thing, if this Court assumed the power to determine whether 
Osmeña's conduct constituted disorderly behaviour, it would thereby have assumed 
appellate jurisdiction, which the Constitution never intended to confer upon a 
coordinate branch of the Government. The theory of separation of powers 
fastidiously observed by this Court, demands in such situation a prudent refusal 
to interfere. Each department, it has been said, has exclusive cognizance of 
matters within its jurisdiction and is supreme within its own sphere. (Angara 
<em>vs</em>. Electoral Commission, 63 Phil., 139.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 200. <em>Judicial Interference with Legislature</em>.-The principle is 
well established that the courts will not assume a jurisdiction in any case 
which will amount to an interference by the judicial department with the 
legislature since each department is equally independent within the powers 
conferred upon it by the Constitution.* * *."</p>
<p>"The general rule has been applied in other cases to cause the courts to 
refuse to intervene in what are exclusively legislative functions- Thus, where 
the state Senate is given the power to expel a member, the courts will not 
review its action or revise <em>even a most arbitrary or unfair decision</em>." 
(11 Am. Jur., Const. Law, sec. 200, p. 902.) [Italics Ours.]</p></blockquote>
<p>The above statement of American law merely abridged the landmark case of 
Clifford <em>vs</em>. French.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In 1905, 
several senators who had been expelled by the State Senate of California for 
having taken a bribe, filed mandamus proceedings to compel reinstatement, 
alleging the Senate had given them no hearing, nor a chance to make defense, 
besides falsity of the charges of bribery. The Supreme Court of California 
declined to interfere, explaining in orthodox juristic language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Under our form, of government, the judicial department has no power to 
revise even the most arbitrary and unfair action of the legislative department, 
or of either house thereof, taking in pursuance of the 'power committed 
exclusively to that department by the Constitution</em>. It has been held by 
high authority that, even in the absence of an express provision conferring the 
power, every legislative body in which is vested the general legislative power 
of the state <em>has</em> the implied <em>power to expel a member for any cause 
which it may deem </em>sufficient. In Hiss <em>vs</em>. Barlett, 3 Gray 473, 63 
Am. Dec. 768, the supreme court of Mass, says, in substance, that this power 
<em>is inherent in every legislative body; that it is necessary to enable the 
body 'to perform its high functions, and is necessary to the safety of the 
state;' 'That it is a power of self-protection, and that the legislative body 
must necessarily be the sole judge tof the exigency which may justify and 
require its exercise</em>. '* * *<em>There is no provision authorizing courts to 
control, direct, supervise, or forbid the exercise by either house of the power 
to expel a member. These powers are functions of the legislative department and 
therefore, in the exercise of the power thus committed to it, the senate is 
supreme</em>. An attempt by this court to direct or control the legislature, or 
either house thereof, in the exercise of the power, would be an <em>attempt to 
exercise legislative functions</em>, which it is expressly forbidden to 
do."</p></blockquote>
<p>We have underscored in the above quotation those lines which in our opinion 
emphasize the principles controlling this litigation. Although referring to 
expulsion, they may, as well be applied to other disciplinary action. Their gist 
as applied to the case at bar: the House has exclusive power; <em>the courts 
have no jurisdiction to interfere</em>.</p>
<p>Our refusal to intervene might impress some readers as subconscious 
hesitation due to discovery of impermissible course of action in the legislative 
chamber. Nothing of that sort: we merely refuse to disregard the allocation of 
constitutional functions which it is our special duty to maintain. Indeed, in 
the interest of comity, we feel bound to state that in a conscientious survey of 
governing principles and/or episodic illustrations, we found the House of 
Representatives of the United States taking the position on at least two 
occasions, that <em>personal attacks upon the Chief Executive</em> constitute 
unparliamentary conduct or breach of order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> And in several instances, it took action 
against offenders, <em>even after other business</em> had been considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p>
<p>Petitioner's principal argument against the House's power to suspend is the 
Alejandrino precedent. In 1924, Senator Alejandrino was, by resolution of the 
Senate, suspended from office for 12 months because he had assaulted another 
member of that Body for certain phrases the latter had uttered in the course of 
a debate. The Senator applied to this Court for reinstatement, challenging the 
validity of the resolution. Although this Court held that in view of the 
separation of powers, it had no jurisdiction to compel the Senate to reinstate 
petitioner, it nevertheless went on to say the Senate had no power to adopt the 
resolution because suspension for 12 months amounted to removal, and the Jones 
Law (under which the Senate was then functioning) gave the Senate <em>no power 
to remove an appointive member</em>, like Senator Alejandrino. The Jones Law 
specifically provided that "each house may punish its members for disorderly 
behaviour, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds votes, expel an 
<em>elective</em> member (sec. 18). Note particularly the word "elective."</p>
<p>The Jones Law, it must be observed, empowered the Governor General to appoint 
"without consent of the Senate and without restriction as to residence senators 
* * * who will, in his opinion, best represent the Twelfth District." 
Alejandrino was one appointive Senator.</p>
<p>It is true, the opinion in that case contained an <em>obiter dictum</em> that 
"suspension deprives the electoral district of representation without that 
district being afforded any means by which to fill that vacancy." But that 
remark should be understood to refer particularly to the <em>appointive 
senator</em> who was then the affected party and who was by the same Jones Law 
charged with the duty to represent the Twelfth District and maybe the views of 
the Government of the United States or of the Governor-General, who had 
appointed him.</p>
<p>It must be observed, however, that <em>at that time</em> the Legislature had 
only those powers which were granted to it by the Jones Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>; whereas <em>now the Congress has the 
full legislative powers and prerogatives</em> of a sovereign nation, except as 
restricted by the Constitution. In other words, in the Alejandrino case, the 
Court reached the conclusion that the Jones Law <em>did not give the Senate</em> 
the power it then exercised-the power of suspension for one year. Whereas now, 
as we find, the Congress <em>has the inherent legislative prerogative of 
suspension</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which the 
Constitution did not impair. In fact, as already pointed out, the Philippine 
Senate suspended a Senator for 12 months in 1949.</p>
<p>"The Legislative power of the Philippine Congress is plenary, subject only to 
such limitations as are found in the Republic's Constitution. So that any power 
deemed to be legislative by usage or tradition, is necessarily possessed by the 
Philippine Congress, unless the Constitution provides otherwise." (Vera 
<em>vs</em>. Avelino, 77 Phil., 192, 212.)</p>
<p>In any event, petitioner's argument as to the deprivation of the district's 
representation can not be more weighty in the matter of suspension than in the 
case of imprisonment of a legislator; yet deliberative bodies have the power in 
proper cases, to commit one of their members to jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
<p>Now come questions of procedure and jurisdiction. The petition intended to 
prevent the Special Committee from acting in pursuance of House Resolution No. 
59. Because no preliminary injunction had been issued, the Committee performed 
its task, reported to the House, and the latter approved the suspension order. 
The House has closed its session, and the Committee has ceased to exist as such. 
It would seem, therefore, the case should be dismissed for having become moot or 
academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Of course, there is nothing 
to prevent petitioner from filing new pleadings to include all members of the 
House as respondents, ask for reinstatement and thereby to present a justiciable 
cause. Most probable outcome of such reformed suit, however, will be a 
pronouncement of lack of jurisdiction, as in Vera <em>vs</em>. Avelino <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and Alejandrino <em>vs</em>. Quezon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>
<p>At any rate, having perceived suitable solutions to the important questions 
of political law, the Court thought it proper to express at this time its 
conclusions on such issues as were deemed relevant and decisive.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the petition has to be, and is hereby dismissed. So ordered.</p>

<div align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION </strong></em></div>
<p><strong>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur with the majority that the petition filed by Congressman 0smeña, Jr. 
does not make out a case either for declaratory judgment or certiorari, since 
this Court has no original jurisdiction over declaratory judgment proceedings, 
and certiorari is available only against bodies exercising judicial or 
quasi-judicial powers. The respondent committee, being merely fact finding, was 
not properly subject to certiorari.</p>
<p>I submit, however, that Congressman Osmena was entitled to invoke the Court's 
jurisdiction on his petition for a writ of prohibition against the committee, in 
so far as House Resoluti6n No. 59 (and its sequel, Resolution No. 175) 
constituted an unlawful attempt td divest him of an immunity from censure or 
punishment, an immunity vested under the very Rules of the House of 
Representatives.</p>
<p>House Rule XVII, on Decorum and Debates, in its section V, provides as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If it is requested that a Member be called to order for words spoken in 
debate, the Member making such request shall indicate the words excepted to, and 
they shall be taken down in writing by the Secretary and read aloud to the 
House; but the Member who uttered them shall not be held to answer, nor be 
subject to the censure of the House therefor, if further debate or other 
business has intervened."</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, it is not disputed that after Congressman Osmena had delivered his 
speech and before the House adopted, fifteen days later, the resolution (No. 59) 
creating the respondent Committee and empowering it to investigate and recommend 
proper action in the case, the House had acted on other matters and debated 
them. That being the case, the Congressman, even before the resolution was 
adopted, had ceased to be answerable for the words uttered by him in his 
privilege speech. By the express wording of the Rules, he was no longer subject 
to censure or disciplinary action by the House. Hence, the resolution, in so far 
as it attempts to divest him of the immunity so acquired and subject him to 
discipline and punishment, when he was previously not so subject, violates the 
constitutional inhibition against <em>ex post facto</em> legislation, and 
Resolutions Nos. 59 and 175 are legally obnoxious and invalid on that score. The 
rule is well established that a law which deprives an accused person of any 
substantial right or immunity possessed by him before its passage is <em>ex post 
facto</em> as to prior offenses (Cor. Jur. Vol. 16-A, section 144, p. 153; 
People <em>vs</em>. McDonnell, 11 Fed. Supp. 1015; People <em>vs</em>. 
Talkington, 47 Pac. 2d 368; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Garfinkel, 69 F. Supp., 849).</p>
<p>The foregoing also answers the contention that since the immunity was but an 
effect of section 7 of House Rule XVII, the House could, at any time, remove it 
by amending those Rules, and Resolutions Nos. 59 and 175 effected such an 
amendment by implication. The right of the House to amend its Rules does not 
carry with it the right to retroactively divest the petitioner of an immunity he 
had already acquired. The Bill of Rights is against it.</p>
<p>It is contended that as the liability for his speech attached when the 
Congressman delivered it, the subsequent action of the House only affected the 
procedure for dealing with that liability. But whatever liability Congressman 
Sergio Osmena, Jr. then incurred was extinguished when the House thereafter 
considered other business; and this extinction is a substantive right that can 
not be subsequently torn away to his disadvantage. On an analogous issue, this 
Court, in People <em>vs</em>. Parel, 44 Phil., 437, has ruled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In regard to the point that the subject of prescription of penalties vnd of 
penal actions pertains to remedial and not substantive law, it is to be observed 
that in the Spanish legal system, <em>provisions for limitation or prescription 
of actions are invariably classified as substantive and not as remedial 
law</em>; we thus find the provisions for the prescription of criminal actions 
in the Penal Code and not in the 'Ley de Enjuidamiento Criminal/ This is in 
reality a more logical law. <em>In criminal cases prescription is not, strictly 
speaking, a matter of procedure; it bars or cuts off the right to punish the 
crime and consequently, goes directly to tJie substance of the action</em>. * * 
* (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I see no substantial difference, from the standpoint of the constitutional 
prohibition against <em>ex past facto</em> laws, that the objectionable measures 
happen to be House Resolutions and not statutes. In so far as the position of 
petitioner Osmena is concerned, the essential point is that he is being 
subjected to a punishment to which.he was formerly not amenable. And while he 
was only meted out a suspension of privileges, that suspension is as much a 
penalty as imprisonment or a fine, which the House could have inflicted upon him 
had it been so minded. Such punitive action is violative of the spirit, if not 
of the letter, of the constitutional provision against <em>ex post facto</em> 
legislation. Nor is it material that the punishment was inflicted in the 
exercise of disciplinary power. "The <em>ex post facto</em> effect of a law," 
the Federal Supreme Court has ruled, "can not be evaded by giving civil form to 
that which is essentially criminal" (Burgess <em>vs</em>. Salmon, 97 L. Ed. 
[U.S.] 1104, 1106; Cummings <em>vs</em>. Missouri, 18 L. Ed. 276).</p>
<p>The plain purpose of the immunity provided by the House rules is to protect 
the freedom of action of its members and to relieve them from the fear of 
disciplinary action taken upon second thought, as a result of political 
convenience, vindictiveness, or pressures. It is unrealistic to overlook that, 
without the immunity so provided, no member of Congress can remain free from the 
haunting fear that his most innocuous expressions may at any time afterwards 
place him in jeopardy of punishment whenever a majdrity, however transient, 
should feel that the shifting sands of political expediency so demand. A rule 
designed to assure that members of the House may freely act as their conscience 
and sense of duty should dictate complements the parliamentary immunity from 
outside pressure enshrined in our Constitution, and is certainly deserving of 
liberal interpretation and application.</p>
<p>The various precedents, cited in the majority opinion, as instances of 
disciplinary action taken notwithstanding intervening business, are not truly 
applicable. Of the five instances cited by Deschler (in his edition of 
Jefferson's Manual), the case of Congressman Watson of Georgia involved also 
<em>printed</em> disparaging remarks by the respondent (III Hinds' Precedents, 
sec. 2637), so that the debate immunity rule afforded no defense; that of 
Congressmen Weaver and Sparks was one of censure for actual disorderly conduct 
(II Hinds, sec. 1657); while the cases of Congressmen Stanbery of Ohio, Alex 
Long of Ohio, and of Lovell Rousseau of Kentucky (II Hinds, sees. 1248, 1252 and 
1655) were decided under Rule 62 of the U. S. House of Representatives as it 
stood before the 1880 amendments, and was differently worded. Thus, in the 
Rousseau case, the ruling of Speaker Coif ax was to the following effect (II 
Hinds' Precedents, page 1131) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This sixty-second rule is divided in the middle by a semicolon, and the 
Chair asks the attention of the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Wilson) to the language 
of that rule, as it settles the whole question:</p>
<p>"62. If a Member be called to order for words spoken in debate, the person 
calling him to order shall repeat the words excepted to"-</p>
<p>That is, the "calling to order" is "excepting" to words spoken in debate "and 
they shall be taken down in writing at the Clerk's table; and no Member shall be 
held to answer, or be subject to the censure of the House, for words spoken in 
debate, if any other Member has spoken, or other business has intervened, after 
the words spoken, and before exception to them shall have been taken."</p>
<p>The first part of this rule declares that "calling to order" is "excepting to 
words spoken in debate." The second part of the rule declares that a Member 
shall not be held subject to censure for words spoken in debate if other 
business has intervened after the words have been spoken and before "exception" 
to them has been taken. Exception to the words of the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. 
Grinnell) was taken by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Harding), the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. Banks), the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rousseau), and 
also by the Speaker of the House, as the records of the Congressional Globe will 
show. The distinction is obvious between the two parts of the rule. In the first 
part it speaks of a Member excepting to language of another and having the words 
taken down. In the last part of the rule it says he shall not be censured 
thereafter unless exception to his words were taken; but it omits to add as an 
essential condition that the words must also have been taken down. The 
substantial point, indeed the only point, required in the latter part of the 
rule is, that exception to the objectionable words must have been 
taken."</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference between the Rules as invoked in these cases and the Rules of 
our House of Representatives is easily apparent. As Rule 62 of the United States 
House of Representatives stood before 1880, all that was required to preserve 
the disciplinary power of the House was that <em>exception should have been 
taken</em> to the remarks on the floor before further debate or other business 
intervened. Under the rules of the Philippine House of Representatives, however, 
the immunity becomes absolute if other debate or business has taken place before 
the motion for censure is made, whether or not exceptions or point of order have 
been made to the remarks complained of at the time they were uttered.</p>
<p>While it is clear that the parliamentary immunity established in Article VI, 
section 15 of our Constitution does not bar the members being questioned and 
disciplined by Congress itself for remarks made on the floor, that disciplinary 
power does not, as I have noted, include the right to retroactively amend the 
rules so as to divest a member of an immunity already gained. And if Courts can 
shield an ordinary citizen from the effects of <em>ex post facto</em> 
legislation, I see no reason why a member of Congress should be deprived of the 
same protection. Surely membership in the Legislature does not mean forfeiture 
of the liberties enjoyed by the individual citizen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Constitution empowers eaeh house to determine its rules of proceeding's. 
<em>It may not by its rules ignore constitutional restraint or violate 
fundamental rights</em> and there should be a reasonable relation between the 
mode or method of proceeding established by the rule and the result which is 
sought to be attained. But within these limitations all matters of method are 
open to the determination of the House, and it is no impeachment of the rule to 
say that some other way would be better, more accurate or even more just." (U. 
S. <em>vs</em>. Ballin, Joseph &amp; Co., 36 Law Ed., 324-325.)</p>
<p>"Courts will not interfere with the action of the state senate in 
reconsidering its vote on a resolution submitting an amendment to the 
Constitution, <em>where its action was in compliance with its own rules, and 
there was no constitutional provision to the contrary</em>" (Crawford 
<em>vs</em>. Gilchrist, 64 Fla. 41, 59 So. 963) (Italics 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, that this Court possesses no power to direct or compel the 
Legislature to act in any specified manner, should not deter it from recognizing 
and declaring the un-constitutionality and nullity of the questioned resolutions 
and of all action that has been taken up in pursuance thereof. Although the 
respondent committee has been disbanded after the case was filed, the basic 
issues remain so important as to require adjudication by this Court.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<div align="center"><em><strong>DISSENTING OPINION </strong></em></div>
<p><strong>LABRADOR, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I fully concur in the above dissent of Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, and I 
venture to add:</p>
<p>Within a constitutional government and in a regime which purports to be one 
of law, where law is supreme, even the Congress in the exercise of the power 
conferred upon it to discipline its members, must follow the rules and 
regulations that it had itself promulgated for its guidance and for that of its 
members. The rules in force at the time Congressman Osmena delivered the speech 
declared by the House to constitute a disorderly conduct provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * but the Member who uttered them shall not be held to answer, nor be 
subject to the censure of the House therefor, if further debate or other 
business has intervened." (Rule XVII, Sec. 7, Rules, House of 
Representatives.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Congressman Osmeña delivered the speech in question on June 23, 1960. It was 
only on July 8, or 15 days after June 23, 1960 when the House created the 
committee that would investigate him. For fully 15 days the House took up other 
matters. All that was done, while the speech was being delivered, was to have 
certain portions thereof deleted. I hold that pursuant to its own Rules the 
House may no longer punish Congressman Osmeña for the speech delivered fifteen 
days before.</p>
<p>The fact that no action was promptly taken to punish Congressman Osmeña 
immediately after its delivery, except to have some parts of the speech deleted, 
shows that the members of the House did not then consider Osmeña's speech a 
disorderly conduct. The idea to punish Congressman Osmeña, which came 15 days 
after, was, therefore, an afterthought. It is, therefore, clear that Congressman 
Osmeña is being made to answer for an act, after the time during which he could 
be punished therefor had lapsed.</p>
<p>The majority opinion holds that the House can amend its rules any time. We do 
not dispute this principle, but we hold that the House may not do so in utter 
disregard of the fundamental principle of law that an amendment takes place onjy 
after its approval, or, as in this case, to the extent of-punishing an offense 
after the time to punish had elapsed. Since the rule, that a member can be 
punished only before other proceedings have intervened, was in force at the time 
Congressman Osmeña delivered his speech, the House may not ignore said rule. It 
is said in the majority opinion that the rule limiting the period for imposition 
of a penalty for a speech to the day it was made, is merely one of procedure. 
With due respect to the opinion of the majority, we do not think that it is 
merely a rule of procedure; we believe it actually is a limitation of the time 
in which the House may take punitive action against an offending member; it is a 
limitation (in reference to time) on the liability to punishment. As Mr. Justice 
J. B. L. Reyes points out, the rule is substantive, not merely a procedural 
principle, and^ may not be ignored when invoked.</p>
<p>If this government is a Government of laws and not of men, then the House 
should observe its own rule and not violate it by punishing a member after the 
period for indictment and punishment had already passed. Not because the subject 
of the Philippic is no less than the Chief Magistrate of the nation should the 
rule of the House be ignored by itself. It is true that our Government is based 
on the principle of separation of powers between the three branches thereof. I 
also agree to the corollary proposition that this Court should not. interfere 
with the legislature in the manner it performs its functions; but I also hold 
that the Court cannot abandon its duty to pronounce what the law is when any of 
its (the House) members, or any humble citizen, invokes the law.</p>
<p>Congressman Osmeña has invoked the protection of a rule of the House. I 
believe it is our bounden duty to state what the rule being invoked by him is, 
to point out the fact that the rule is being violated in meting out punishment 
for his speech; we should not shirk our responsibility to declare his rights 
under the rule simply on the broad excuse of separation of powers. Even the 
legislature may not ignore the rule it has promulgated for the government of the 
conduct of its members, and the fact that a coordinate branch of the Government 
is involved, should not deter us from performing our duty. We may not possess 
the power to enforce our opinion if the House chooses to disregard the same. In 
such case the members thereof stand before the bar of public opinion to answer 
for their act in ignoring what they themselves have approved as their norm of 
conduct.</p>
<p>Let it be clearly understood that the writer of this dissent personally 
believes that vituperous attacks against the Chief Executive, or any official or 
citizen for that matter, should be condemned. But where the Rules, promulgated 
by the House itself, fix the period during which punishment may be meted out, 
said Rules should be enforced regardless of who may be prejudiced thereby. Only 
in that way may the supremacy of the law be maintained.</p>
<p><em>Petition dismissed</em>.</p>
<p>Appendix-Suspension op Member op Legislative Body</p>
<p>I. Whatever is spoken in the house is subject to the censure of the house; 
and offenses of this kind have been severely punished by calling the person to 
the bar to make submission, <em>committing him to prison</em>, expelling him 
from the house or <em>inflicting other punishment</em>. (Mason, Manual of 
Legislative Procedure, pp. 402-403.)</p>
<p>II. 171.-(1) If a Member is named by the Speaker, or by the chairman of a 
committee of the whole House, immediately after the commission of the offence of 
disregarding the authority of the chair, or of persistently and wilfully 
obstructing the business of the House, by abusing the rules of the House, 
then-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<em>i</em>) If the offence has been committed by a Member in the House, the 
Speaker forthwith puts the question, on a motion being made, no amendment, 
adjournment or debate being allowed, that the Member (naming him) <em>be 
suspended from the service</em> of the House; and * * *</p></blockquote>
<p>(2) The suspension of a Member on the first occasion continues until the 
fifth day, and on the second occasion until the <em>twentieth</em> day on which 
the House sits after the day on which he was suspended, <em>but on any 
subsequent occasion it continues</em> until the House resolves that such 
suspension be terminated. A Member suspended under this rule must forthwith quit 
the precincts of the House. (House of Commons, Manual of Procedure in the Public 
Business, p. 114.)</p>
<p>III. In the course of the debate, Mr. Nelson W. Aldrich, of Rhode Island, 
read the following from Cushing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The power to expel also includes in it a power to discharge a Member, for 
good cause, without inflicting upon him the censure and disgrace implied in the 
term "expulsion', and this has accordingly been done, in some instances by the 
House of Commons.</p>
<p>Analogous to the right of expulsion is <em>that of suspending</em> a Member 
from the exercise of his functions as such, for a longer or shorter period; 
which is a sentence of milder character, than the former, though attended with 
somewhat different effects; for during the suspension the electors are deprived 
of the services of their representative, without power to supply his place; but 
the rights of the electors are no more infringed by this proceeding than by an 
exercise of the power to expression." (Hinds Precedents II, Sec. 
1665.</p></blockquote>
<p>IV. <em>The suspension of members</em> from the service of the House is 
another form of punishment. (May's Parliamentary Practice, p. 53, cited by 
Hinds, p. 1141, Vol. II.)</p>
<p>V. The Leader of the House then moves that the Member <em>be suspended</em> 
from the service of the House, and the motion must be put to the question 
'without amendment, adjournment or debate.'</p>
<p>If the member is named in Committee of the whole House by the Chairman, the 
latter immediately suspends the proceedings and reports the circumstances to the 
House when the Speaker has resumed the Chair. From this point matters proceed as 
described above.</p>
<p><em>If the House agrees to the suspension</em>, the Speaker again directs the 
member to withdraw and, if he still persists in refusing to do so, even when 
summoned under the Speaker's orders by the Sergeant-at-Arms, force is resorted 
to. If this is necessary, the Speaker calls the attention of the House to the 
fact, and in such a case the suspension of the member is for the remainder of 
the session. The normal period of suspension is now fixed at five sitting' days 
for the first offence and twenty for the second, the uncompleted portion of the 
sitting during which the offence was committed counting as one day. The first 
offence is taken to mean the first during that session.</p>
<p>A member <em>who is suspended</em> is not exempt from serving on a Private 
Bill Committee but, apart from this exception, suspension from the service of 
the House of Commons means exclusion from the precincts of the Palace of 
Westminster.</p>
<p>A member guilty of a breach of privilege or contempt <em>may be 
suspended</em> without being named, but in such a case the motion for his 
suspension would be subject to debate. The practice of 'naming' a member was 
first introduced by Speaker Lenthal (q.v.) in 1941. (An Encyclopaedia of 
Parliament by Wilding and Laundy, p. 366.)</p>
<p>VI. Offences which are not sufficiently grave to warrant imprisonment are 
punished by admonition to reprimand, the latter being the more serious 
punishment of the two. * * * Members of Parliament who commit offences are 
liable to two further penalties: <em>suspension from the service</em> of the 
House and expulsion. (An Encyclopedia of Parliament by Wilding and Laundy, p. 
456.)</p>
<p>VII. A portion of the majority, Messrs. L. E. McComas of Maryland, Albert J. 
Beverridge of Indiana, and J.C. Pritchard of North Carolina, submitted views in 
favor of <em>suspension</em> of the two senators. After discussing the power to 
punish generally, they submitted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Like Parliament, it may imprison or expel a member for offenses.<em> 
The suspension of members from the service of the, House is another form of 
punishment. (May's Parliamentary Practice 53). </em>This author gives<em> 
instances of suspension </em>in the seventeenth century and shows the<em> 
frequent suspension </em>of members under a standing' order of the House of 
Commons, passed February 23, 1880."</p></blockquote>
<p>Says Cushing, section 280: <em>"Members may also be suspended</em> by way of 
punishment from their functions as such, either in whole or in part or for a 
limited time. This is a sentence of a milder character than expulsion."</p>
<p>During the suspension, says Cushing, section 627, the electors are deprived 
of the services of their representatives without power to supply his place, but 
the rights of the electors are no more infringed by this proceeding than by an 
exercise o£, jhe power to imprison. (Vol. II, Hinds' Precedents of the House of 
Representatives, p. 1141.)</p>
<p>VIII. <em>Suspension from the service</em> of the House was a punishment 
employed by the House of Commons under4 its power of enforcing discipline among 
its Members, long before it was prescribed by standing order for particular 
offenses, such as disregard of authority of the Chair, or obstruction, and it 
can still be imposed at the discretion of the House, although, of course, not 
under the summary procedure authorized by that standing order (see p. 471).</p>
<p>In 1641, Mr. Gervaise Hollis was suspended by the House during the 
session.</p>
<p>In 1643, Sir Norton Knatchbull was suspended by the House during the pleasure 
of the House.</p>
<p>For nearly two centuries this form of punishment had been in abeyance, no 
cause of suspension having occurred since 1692. But at the discretion of the 
House on 25 of July 1877, as a result of persistent obstruction by Members who 
supported Parnell, Mr. Speaker Brand gave the following ruling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The House is perfectly well aware that any Member persistently and wilfully 
obstructing public business without just and reasonable cause is guilty of a 
contempt of this House, and is liable to punishment whether by censure, 
<em>suspension</em> from the service of the House, or commitment, <em>according 
to the judgment of the House</em>" (Parl. Deb. [1877] 235, c. 
1814).</p></blockquote>
<p>On 20 February 1911, Mr. Ginnell, <em>a Member was suspended</em> for one 
week as a punishment for a breach of privilege in publishing a letter reflecting 
on the Speaker's conduct in the Chair. C. J. (1911) 37.</p>
<p>In February 1880, the procedure for suspending a Member for particular 
offenses was laid down by Standing Order No. 22 (see p. 471), <em>and suspension 
under</em> this Standing Order not infrequent. (The Law, Privileges Proceedings 
Usage of Parliament, 6th Ed. pp. 48-53, Fellows and Cocks.)</p>
<p>IX. Resp. having entered the Chamber of the New South Wales Assembly, of 
which he was a member, within a week after it had passed a resolution that 
<em>he be "suspended from the service</em> of the House," he was removed 
therefrom and prevented from re-entering it:-Held: the resolution must not be 
construed as operating beyond the sitting during which the resolution was 
passed.-Burton <em>vs</em>. Taylor (1886), 11 App. Cas. 197, P. C.- AUS (Copied 
from English and Empire Digest (1927) Vol. 36, p. 295.)</p></div>
