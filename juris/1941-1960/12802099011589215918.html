				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The original information filed on March 6, 1946, against the petitioner in 
the People's Court charged him with the crime of treason in that he being a 
Filipino citizen, and owing allegiance to the United States and the Commonwealth 
of the Philippines, in violation of said duty of allegiance during the period 
comprised between November 1, 1944, and February 3, 1946, in the City of Manila, 
the petitioner for the purpose and with the intent of giving aid and comfort to 
the enemy, did willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and traitorously join and 
accept, hold and perform the functions and duties, of a spy or informer for the 
Japanese Military Police, helping them in the apprehension of guerrillas and 
other pro-American elements; and more particularly on or about December 15, 
1944, arrested one Ernesto Simpao, a guerrilla, tied his hands behind his back 
and forced him to jump into the water in the Manila North Harbor, and while said 
Ernesto Simpao was in such helpless, condition he was shot to death.</p>
<p>Before the defendant has pleaded, the Office of the Official Prosecutors 
filed on May 25, 1945, an "Amended information by way of a Bill of particulars 
on the original information," in which, besides the overt act alleged in the 
original, other overt acts are alleged or specified, to wit: That in the City of 
Manila the petitioner, in his capacity as spy or informer of the Japanese 
Military Police, for the purpose and with the intent of giving aid and comfort 
to the enemy, on or about October 29, 1944, did willfully guide and help five 
(5) armed" Japanese spies and informers in the arrest of one Albino Rutao, a 
guerrilla suspect, who was taken by them to places unknown, and since then he 
has never been seen again or heard from; that on or about January 24, 1945, the 
petitioner did lead, accompany and help six (6) armed Filipino spies and 
informers in the arrest of one Ariston Tamon and another guerrilla companion of 
said Tamon (name unknown), because of their guerrilla activities, and after 
punishing said Tamon and companion severely, they were taken to places unknown, 
and since then they have never been again seen or heard from; and that on or 
about the afternoon of January 24, 1945, the petitioner did lead, guide, and 
help three (3) armed Japanese spies and informers in the arrest of one Felix de 
Leon, a guerrilla belonging to Ramsey unit, and took him to the Japanese 
Military garrison at the Air Port Studio, Azcarraga, Manila, and since then said 
De Leon has never been seen again or heard from.</p>
<p>The attorneys for the petitioner filed a motion to quash the allegation of 
three additional overt acts in the amended information, on the ground that the 
amendment constitutes a new information filed after the period of six months 
fixed by law from the passage of Commonwealth Act No., 682, has elapsed. The 
People's Court denied the motion to quash, as well as the motion for 
reconsideration filed by the petitioner on September 4, 1946.</p>
<p>This case is now before us because the petitioner has filed a petition for 
<em>certiorari</em> on the ground that the respondents acted in excess of the 
People's Court's jurisdiction in admitting said amended information.<br>Section 
2 of Act No. G82 provides:</p>
<p>"SEC. 2. The People's Court shall have jurisdiction to try and decide all 
cases of crimes against national security committed between December eight, 
nineteen hundred forty-one and September two, nineteen hundred forty-five, and 
filed within six (6) months from the passage of this Act: <em>Provided, 
however,</em> That any such cases not so instituted within said period of six 
(6) months shall be filed with, tried and determined by the proper Court of 
First Instance; * * *."</p>
<p>The only question to be determined in the "present case is, whether or not 
after an information charging a person with the crime of treason has been filed 
within the period of six months from the passage of Act No. 682, said 
information may be amended, before the defendant has pleaded, by alleging in the 
amended information additional overt acts committed by the defendant in aid of 
the enemy within the period of time alleged in the information.</p>
<p>After a careful consideration of the matter, we are of the opinion, and 
therefore so hold, that the amended information is not a new information, and 
the presentation thereof is not the filing of a new case of treason, because it 
does not charge another offense different or distinct from that charged in the 
original one. It merely amends the original information by more particularly 
specifying the charge or laying what is termed "to adhere to the enemies, giving 
them aid and comfort"; and consequently, in accordance with elementary rules of 
procedure, the amended information relates back to the date at which said 
original information was filed, that is, within the prescribed period of six 
months. The crime of treason such as charged against the petitioner may be 
committed by executing, either a single, or several intentional overt acts, 
different or similar but distinct, and for that reason it may be called or 
considered a continuous offense. A person who commits treason is not criminally 
responsible for as many crimes of treason as overt acts ho has intentionally 
committed to aid the enemy. All overt acts he has done or might have done for 
that purpose constitute but a single offense.<br>The overt acts alleged in the 
amended information are but a specification of the crime charged in the original 
It is necessary to make such specification, because it is a well known rule that 
treason can only be established by proof of overt acts; and those overt acts 
only which are charged in the indictment or information can be given in 
evidence. It is perfectly clear that it would not be sufficient to allege 
generally that the accused had adhered to the enemy giving her aid and comfort, 
as alleged in the second paragraph of the original and amended information. The 
charge must be more particularly specified by laying what is termed an overt act 
of giving aid and comfort to the enemy. A person charged with treason can only 
be convicted of the overt act or acts laid in the information, because, 
according to section 1 (b), Rule 111, of the Rules of Court, a defendant has the 
right to be informed, not only of the nature of the accusation or the offense 
charged, but also of the cause thereof, that is, the acts committed by the 
defendant constituting that offense.</p>
<p>As a matter of procedure, the amendment was properly admitted, because 
section 22 of Act No. 682 provides that "The prosecution, trial, and disposal of 
cases before the People's Court shall be governed by existing laws and Rules of 
Court unless otherwise provided for herein." And section 13, Rule 106, of the 
Rules of Court prescribes that "the information or complaint may be amended, in 
substance or form, without leave of court, at any time before the defendant 
pleads." There is nothing in Act No. 682 which provides otherwise. To uphold the 
contention of the petitioner would be tantamount to authorize the Government 
to file in the proper Court of First Instance another information against the 
petitioner for treason constituted by the overt acts alleged in the amended 
information, splitting thereby the single crime of treason committed by the 
petitioner into two, and put him in danger of being convicted twice for the same 
offense.</p>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, the respondents or the People's Court acted 
within its jurisdiction in admitting the amended information in this case, and 
therefore the petitioner's petition is dismissed with costs against him. So 
ordered.</p><em>Moran, C.J., Paras, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones,</em> and 
<em>Tuason, JJ.,</em> concur. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>CUNCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the foregoing majority opinion. The filing of the so-called 
amended information dated May 25, 1946, within the very same case wherein the 
original information had been presented against the self-same accused, did not 
bring the case within the purview of the proviso of section 2 of Commonwealth 
Act No. 682. The reason is that said proviso, in express terms, refers to cases 
not instituted before the People's Court within six months from the passage of 
said Act, which took place on September 25, 1945 and the original information 
having been lodged within the said six-month period, namely, on March 6, 1946 
and the filing of the so-called amended information thereafter not constituting 
the institution of a new case, it is clear that we are not dealing here with a 
case not instituted within said six-month period.</p></div>
