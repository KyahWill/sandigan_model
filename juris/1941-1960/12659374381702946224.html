				<H3>LEONARDO GARCIA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. FRANCISCO BONIFACIO AND SIMPLICIO PEÑA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Leonardo Garcia has appealed the order of the Manila court of first instance, 
dismissing his complaint whefeby he attempted to recover damages and compel 
defendants to convey to him the certificate of public convenience issued by the 
Public Service Commission covering a certain jeepney. He claimed to have 
purchased both. The Hon. Bienvenido Tan, Judge, held that plaintiff had no 
rights enforceable before the courts—not even damages—since he had not secured 
the sale's approval by the said Commission. Thither, he implied, plaintiff 
should go for relief. <p></p>
<p>Such certificate of public convenience plaintiff-appellant relates—"was 
issued by the Public Service Commission, to Eustacio Lazcano in PSC Case No. 
63399 (Exhibit G). Lazcano sold this certificate to defendant Simplicio Peña on 
February 15, 1953 (Exhibit A), and Peña in turn sold it to defendant Francisco 
Bonifacio on June 19, 1953 (Exhibit B). Plaintiff acquired the said certificate 
from Bonifacio by deed of absolute sale dated February 27, 1956 (Exhibit F), 
together with one TPU jeepney." </p>
<p>Subsequently, the plaintiff discovered that the certificate in the name of 
Lazcano which he bought from defendant Bonifacio "had already been cancelled" 
because defendant Peña presented to the Commission a false deed of sale by 
Lazcano to him of April 28, 1955, and obtained another certificate for himself, 
even as he requested for—and received—permission to drop from the service the 
very jeepney he (Peña) had previously transferred to Bonifacio (which plaintiff 
acquired). For that reason, plaintiff avers, he was prevented from operating the 
jeepney. </p>
<p>There are other circumstances, which defendants-appellees bring to our 
attention to explain their side, particularly to support their defense that upon 
plaintiff's failure to secure the Commission's approval, steps had to be taken 
to prevent the certificate's cancellation through abandonment. But these need 
not be recounted, inasmuch as we agree that the courts were not the appropriate 
place wherein to obtain what the plaintiff desired: conveyance of the 
certificate, with the concommitant privilege to operate the jeepney as common 
carrier. </p>
<p>The law is quite clear and specific. No sale of a certificate of public 
convenience shall be operative.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> without 
the approval of the Public Service Commission, which may be given even after the 
contract of sale is perfected. The consummation of the sale, however, <span style="font-style: italic;">takes 
place</span> and the operation under the certificate<span style="font-style: italic;"> begins</span>, on the date to be fixed by 
the Commission in its decree of approval.</p>
<p>Here are the statutory provisions;</p>
<p></p><blockquote>"SEC. 20.—Acts requiring the approval of the Commission.—Subject to 
established limitations and exceptions and saving provisions to the contrary, it 
shall be unlawful for any public service or for the owner, lessee or operator 
thereof, without the approval and authorization of the Commission previously had 
* * * <p></p>
<p>"(g) To sell, alienate, mortgage, encumber or lease its property, franchises, 
certificates, privileges, or rights, or any part thereof; * * * The approval 
herein required shall be given, after notice to the public and after hearing the 
persons interested at a public hearing, if it be shown that there are just and 
reasonable grounds for making * * * the sale, alienation, lease, merger, or 
consolidation to be approved, and that the same are not detrimental to the 
public interest, and in case of a sale, the date on which the same is to be 
consummated shall be fixed in the order of approval: Provided, however, That 
nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the transaction from 
being negotiated or completed before its approval. * * * "</p></blockquote> <p></p>
<p>Obviously, the Manila court had no authority to grant the relief demanded, 
because the sale had not been okayed by the Commission. Plaintiff admitted he 
never asked for such approval, which, by the way is not a mere formality that 
could be dispensed with or taken for granted. As the statute directs, the 
Commission must, before approving, be convinced after a hearing and notice, that 
the sale shall not hinder the public's convenience. </p>
<p>"I could not properly go to the Commission"—argues appellant—"because there 
was a dispute as to the terms of the sale: whereas I claimed the <i>whole</i> 
certificate for three jeepneys, defendant Bonifacio asserted he had sold <i>part 
only</i>." "The Commission," he continues "can not be expected to act on a 
petition for approval of a sale if the vendor himself denies having made the 
sale."</p>
<p>Herein lies the erroneous assumption, root and basis of plaintiffs, 
contentions. </p>
<p>In Del Rosario <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Vergara<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> the alleged 
seller denied having made the sale (of certificate) for which the approval of 
the Commission was requested by the purchaser. The Commission, after listening 
to both sides, approved the sale notwithstanding the seller's objection. On 
appeal, we affirmed. </p>
<p>Indeed, if as appellant represents, the certificate sold to him was later 
illegally transferred to Peña, who now holds the Commission's approval and 
certificate, there is no better place than the Commission itself to thresh out 
the respective rights of the parties, bearing in mind that said Commission is 
the only entity empowered to withdraw the certificate from Pena and to transfer 
it to herein plaintiff or grant him a new certificate. Of course, if the 
evidence and the law applicable thereto so warranted. </p>
<p>Again, appellant doubts the usefulness of a resort to the Commission, because 
he wishes to collect monetary damages, which, he believes, that Body has no 
power to award. </p>
<p>Let us concede, for the moment, the alleged lack of authority on. the 
Commission's part—a point we do not decide. </p>
<p>Plaintiff's amended complaint asked for: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"P-2a. Damages, by way of loss of earning, from February 28, 1956, up to the 
time the certificate of public convenience above referred to is finally conveyed 
to plaintiff, at the rate of P30.00 per day; </p>
<p>P-2b. Moral damages in the sum of P2,000.00; </p>
<p>P-2c. Attorney's fees in the sum of P1,000.00, plus the costs of this suit; 
</p>
<p>P-3. Ordering defendant Simplicio Peña to pay to plaintiff exemplary damages, 
by way of example or correction for the public good, in the sum of 
P1,000.00."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first item could not evidently be granted, because plaintiff had <i>no 
right to operate</i> the jeepney without having previously secured the approval 
of the Commission which he never asked. Therefore, he could claim no loss of 
earning. The moral and exemplary damages may only be recovered, if at all, after 
plaintiff's position is upheld. Yet even if the sale be disapproved, perhaps 
plaintiff may recover, if such disapproval should rest on actionable acts of 
defendants, or one of them. At any rate, damages if any should be awarded only 
after the matter of the sale has been clarified, and/or approved. </p>
<p>As to attorney's fees, when the complaint is dismissed—as in this case—the 
defendant could not obviously be charged with plaintiff's counsel fees. </p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, and finding no reversible error in the appealed 
order, we hereby affirm it, with coats against appellant. </p>
