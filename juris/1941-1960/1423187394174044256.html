				<H3>METROPOLITAN INSURANCE CO.,  SUBSTITUTED BY THE SPOUSES LORETO Z. MARCAIDA AND  MIGUEL  DE MARCAIDA, PETITIONERS AND APPELLEES, VS. ELINO PIGTAIN AND TEODGRA CARPIO PIGTAIN, OPPOSITORS AND APPELLANTS.</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The issue involved in this case is whether the petitioners have&nbsp; right&nbsp; to the cancellation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the preliminary attachment lien recorded in favor of the oppositors&nbsp; at&nbsp; the back of Transfer Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 48508 in the&nbsp; name of Daniel A. Jordan and his wife and carried over and copied at the&nbsp; back of Transfer&nbsp; Certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Title No. 38065 subsequently issued in the name of the petitioner Metropolitan Insurance Co., one of the&nbsp; appellees.<br><br>The record discloses that on June 3,&nbsp; 1952, Daniel&nbsp; A. Jordan executed a&nbsp; real estate mortgage in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Metropolitan&nbsp; Insurance Co.&nbsp; over&nbsp; a&nbsp; parcel&nbsp; of land with improvements&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; covered&nbsp; by&nbsp; Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 49508,&nbsp; to secure&nbsp; the payment of a loan of P12,000.&nbsp; For failure of&nbsp; the mortgagor Daniel A. Jordan to pay his loan plus interest, the Metropolitan Insurance Co. foreclosed the mortgage&nbsp; and the&nbsp; property&nbsp; was&nbsp; sold by the&nbsp; Sheriff of Manila at public&nbsp; auction on December 15,&nbsp; 1953, under the&nbsp; provisions of Act 3135&nbsp; as amended, upon&nbsp; previous publication of the corresponding notices required by law&nbsp; which were published, once&nbsp; a week,&nbsp; for three consecutive weeks,&nbsp; on November 9,&nbsp; 16 and 23, 1953, in The Manila&nbsp; Chronicle,&nbsp; a newspaper of general circulation.&nbsp; In&nbsp; that extrajudicial sale at public auction,&nbsp; the Metropolitan Insurance Co. was the highest bidder, hence the mortgaged property&nbsp; was sold unto it for the sum of P14,5OO and, subsequently,&nbsp; on <i>January 6,&nbsp; 1954,</i> the Sheriff of Manila executed&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale, the last portion of&nbsp; which clearly states:<br><blockquote>"<i>I&nbsp; HEREBY CERTIFY</i> that said purchaser&nbsp; <i>METROPOLITAN INSURANCE Company,</i> being the highest bidder and the mortgagee, considered&nbsp; himself paid to the amount&nbsp; of fot:rtdrn thousand five hundred pesos&nbsp; (P14,500) the sale price of tho property.&nbsp; I, therefore, issued to him/her this certificate under the grantees&nbsp; prescribed by law.<br><br>The period of redemption of said property sold expires on the 16th day of December,&nbsp; 1954."</blockquote>Prior to the sale at public auction, to wit, on<i> January 15, 1958,</i> in Civil&nbsp; Case No. 18482, entitled Elino Pigtain and&nbsp; Teodora Carpio&nbsp; Pigtain&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Daniel&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Jordan and Anastacia Angeles Jordan, the oppositors-appellants&nbsp; obtained from the Court of First Instance of Manila a, writ of preliminary attachment,&nbsp; by&nbsp; virtue of which the properties mortgaged to the Metropolitan Insurance Co. were levied, upon.&nbsp; The writ of&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; attachment was filed&nbsp; in the office&nbsp; of the Register&nbsp; of Deeds of Manila on <i>June 7, 1053,</i> and annotated at the back of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 48508, but not in the owner's duplicate of said Transfer Certificate of Title which was in the possession of the petitioner Metropolitan Insurance Co.<br><br>Neither&nbsp; Elino Pigtain and Teodora&nbsp; Carpio Pigtain, as attaching creditors, nor Daniel&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Jordan&nbsp; and&nbsp; Anastacia Angeles Jordan, as mortgagors, did exercise the right of redemption granted by Section&nbsp; 6 of Act 3135 as amended up to December 16, 1954, hence on <i>December 17, 1954</i> the Metropolitan Insurance Co. registered in&nbsp; the Office of the Register of Deeds&nbsp; the certificate of sale executed in&nbsp; its favor by the Sheriff of the&nbsp; City of Manila together with an affidavit of consolidation and, by virtue of these instruments, on the same date, the Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title No. 48508 in the name of Daniel A. Jordan was cancelled and in lieu thereof Transfer Certificate of Title No. 38065 was issued in the name of Metropolitan&nbsp; Insurance Co. On February 17, 1955, the oppositors-appellants Elino&nbsp; Pigtain and Teodora Carpio Pigtain tendered to the&nbsp; Metropolitan Insurance Co. the sum of P14.500, covered by the National City Bank of New York manager's check No. M-59127, to redeem the properties&nbsp; in question, but the&nbsp; Metropolitan Insurance Co.&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; accept it.<br><br>Prior to February 17, 1955, or&nbsp; to be more&nbsp; exact,&nbsp; on February 14, 1955, the Metropolitan Insurance Co. filed a petition for the cancellation of the preliminary attachment recorded in favor of the oppositors-appellants at the back of the Transfer Certificate of Title No. 48508&nbsp; as well as in the Transfer Certificate of&nbsp; Title No.&nbsp; 38065 subsequently issued in the name of the petitioner-appellee Metropolitan Insurance Co., on the ground that the latter had acquired absolute ownership&nbsp; of the properties&nbsp; in question for the period of redemption expired on December 16, 1954 without the herein appellants as attaching creditors&nbsp; having exercised their right to redeem the properties in question sold at public auction.&nbsp; Answering the petition, the oppositors-appellants averred that on February&nbsp; 17, 1955 they tendered the sum of P14,500, covered by a, bank manager's check, in payment of the redemption price&nbsp; of the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; in question; that said payment&nbsp; was tendered within one year&nbsp; from December&nbsp; 17, 1954, the date of the&nbsp; registration of the certificate of sale executed by&nbsp; the Sheriff of the City&nbsp; of Manila and&nbsp; the&nbsp; issuance of the Transfer Certificate of Title No. 38065 in the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of the Metropolitan Insurance&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; and that&nbsp; the annotation of&nbsp; the preliminary&nbsp; attachment in question should be&nbsp; maintained because it should be&nbsp; given preference over&nbsp; the sale&nbsp; at public auction of the mortgaged properties in&nbsp; question in favor of the petitioners.<br><br>After due&nbsp; trial, the&nbsp; court <i>a quo</i> ordered the cancellation of the annotation of the preliminary&nbsp; attachment in&nbsp; question, hence this appeal on the ground that&nbsp; (1) the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; has no jurisdiction to summarily decide the case at bar by reason of the&nbsp; controversial nature&nbsp; of the&nbsp; same; and (2)&nbsp; that the&nbsp; court erred&nbsp; in ordering the annotation of the cancellation of the attachment&nbsp; lien at&nbsp; the back of Certificate of Title No. 38065 issued&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of the petitioner-appellee Metropolitan Insurance Co.<br><br>While the&nbsp; appeal was pending, the&nbsp; Metropolitan&nbsp; Insurance Co. sold the properties involved&nbsp; in this case&nbsp; to&nbsp; the spouses Loreto Z.&nbsp; Marcaida&nbsp; and&nbsp; Miguel de Marcaida and, upon petition duly acted upon&nbsp; by this&nbsp; Court, said spouses were&nbsp; made parties&nbsp; in this case&nbsp; in&nbsp; substitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the original petitioner.<br><br>As could readily be seen, the main question is whether the&nbsp; annotation of the preliminary attachment in question in&nbsp; the aforecited transfer&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; title should be cancelled in view&nbsp; of the facts surrounding the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioners sustain&nbsp; the affirmative&nbsp; contending that the oppositors-appellants having failed to exercise their right to redeem the properties in question within one year,&nbsp; or to be more exact, up to December 16,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; the preliminary attachment in&nbsp; question had become&nbsp; valueless and should not&nbsp; remain in the Transfer Certificate of&nbsp; Title No. 38065 to the&nbsp; prejudice of the Metropolitan&nbsp; Insurance Co., the true owner of said properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is undisputed that only on <i>February&nbsp; 17, 1955</i> did the oppositors-appellants tender to the petitioner-appellee, the manager's check No. 159127 for&nbsp; the sum of P14,500 to redeem the properties in question and unquestionably,&nbsp; and&nbsp; on that date the period of one&nbsp; year granted to the oppositors-appellants as judgment creditors to&nbsp; redeem&nbsp; the&nbsp; land,&nbsp; had&nbsp; already elapsed, for Section&nbsp; 6&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 3135 provides:<br><blockquote> "In all cases in which an&nbsp; extrajudicial&nbsp; sale is made under the special power herein before referred to, the debtor, his successors in interest or any judicial creditor of said debtor, or&nbsp; any person having a lien on the property&nbsp; subsequent to&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage or deed of trust under&nbsp; which the property is sold, may redeem the&nbsp; same at any time within the term of one&nbsp; year from and after the <i>date of the sale; </i>and such&nbsp; redemption shall be governed by the provisions of sections four hundred and sixty-four to&nbsp; four hundred and sixty- six inclusive, of the&nbsp; Code of Civil Procedure, (now sections&nbsp; 25 to 31 of Rule&nbsp; B9&nbsp; of the Rules&nbsp; of Court)&nbsp; insofar&nbsp; as these are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act." </blockquote>It is however claimed that on December&nbsp; 1, 1954,&nbsp; the appellants wrote the appellee,&nbsp; the Metropolitan Insurance Co.,&nbsp; signifying&nbsp; their willingness to assume the obligation to pay all the accounts of Daniel A. Jordan and Anastacia Angeles Jordan with the appellee; that subsequently&nbsp; they personally manifested said readiness to the appellee and its counsel and that on February 17, 1955 they tendered to the appellee&nbsp; a manager's check for the&nbsp; sum of P14,500 to redeem the properties&nbsp; in question, and&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; the preliminary&nbsp; attachment should&nbsp; be maintained&nbsp; until&nbsp; the decision in Civil Case No. 18482 mentioned above is finally decided by the corresponding court.&nbsp; We find&nbsp; no merit in their contention.&nbsp; Carefully examined, the offer&nbsp; made by the oppositors-appellants to the petitioner-appellee through their letter&nbsp; of December 1, 1954 and their personal interview with the petitioner-appellee and its counsel, at most can&nbsp; be considered as an&nbsp; offer to pay the&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; of Daniel A. Jordan to the petitioner-appellee,&nbsp; but the same cannot be legally considered as tender of payment for&nbsp; the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; exercising&nbsp; their right of redemption.&nbsp; And when on&nbsp; February 17, 1955 they&nbsp; tendered&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid manager's check for the sum of P14,500, their&nbsp; right to redeem had already elapsed, for in the certificate of sale executed by&nbsp; the Sheriff of Manila, the period&nbsp; of redemption was&nbsp; fixed to December 16,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; But again&nbsp; the appellants claim that in this particular case, the statutory redemption period of one year should begin&nbsp; from December&nbsp; 17, 1954 when the auction&nbsp; sale was actually recorded in&nbsp; the&nbsp; office of the Register of Deeds of Manila, and not from December 15, 1953 when the sale at public auction of the properties in question&nbsp; took&nbsp; place.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; find&nbsp; this contention&nbsp; to&nbsp; be also&nbsp; untenable in view of the clear provision of the aforesaid&nbsp; Section 6&nbsp; of Act No. 3135&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; the right of redemption should&nbsp; be exercised within&nbsp; one year from the date of the sale.&nbsp; It should not&nbsp; be overlooked that&nbsp; the extrajudicial&nbsp; sale&nbsp; in&nbsp; question was&nbsp; in pursuance of a mortgage and not by&nbsp; virtue of an ordinary writ of execution in a civil case.&nbsp; The Metropolitan&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; Co. was&nbsp; a <i>mortgagee&nbsp; whose right</i> to be paid&nbsp; the&nbsp; entire loan guaranteed by the mortgage is preferential to&nbsp; that of any subsequent creditor&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgagor&nbsp; might have&nbsp; after&nbsp; the execution of the mortgage.&nbsp; The preliminary&nbsp; attachment in question was therefore subordinate to the mortgage in favor of the Metropolitan&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; and unless&nbsp; the whole indebtedness for which the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; in&nbsp; question were mortgaged is&nbsp; wholly&nbsp; satisfied, the herein&nbsp; appellants as attaching creditors acquired no right over said mort- gaged properties for the satisfaction of their&nbsp; credit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter,&nbsp; therefore cannot claim&nbsp; preferential right&nbsp; on&nbsp; the mortgaged properties in&nbsp; question for the&nbsp; satisfaction&nbsp; of. their credit over that of the petitioner-appellee, the Metropolitan Insurance Co., because the mortgage in the latter's favor was recorded prior to the attachment lien&nbsp; of the appellants.&nbsp; And since the appellants had failed to redeem the land in question within the time&nbsp; allowed by Section 6 of Act 3135, the appellee has perfect right to secure the cancellation of the attachment lien in question.<br><br>The&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; also claim that there being&nbsp; a controversial matter&nbsp; in the present case, the court can not summarily order&nbsp; the cancellation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; annotation&nbsp; of the attachment lien in&nbsp; question and&nbsp; that the same should be brought&nbsp; in an ordinary&nbsp; civil action.&nbsp; This contention&nbsp; is also untenable, for&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 112 of the&nbsp; Land Registration Act provides as follows:<br><blockquote> "* * * * Any&nbsp; registered owner&nbsp; or other person&nbsp; in interest may at any time apply by&nbsp; petition to the&nbsp; court, upon the ground that registered&nbsp; interests of&nbsp; any description, whether vested, contingent, expectant,&nbsp; or inchoate, have terminated&nbsp; and&nbsp; ceased; or that new interests have arisen or heen created which do not appear upon the certificate; or that any error, omission, or mistake&nbsp; was made&nbsp; in entering&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; or&nbsp; any&nbsp; memorandum&nbsp;&nbsp; thereon,&nbsp; or&nbsp; on any duplicate certificate;&nbsp; * * *; <i>Provided, however,</i>&nbsp; That this section shall not&nbsp; be construed to give&nbsp; the&nbsp; court authority to open&nbsp; the original decree of registration, and&nbsp; that nothing&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be done or ordered by the court which shall impair the title&nbsp; or&nbsp; other&nbsp; interest of a purchaser holding a certificate for value&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; good faith, or his heirs&nbsp; or assigns,&nbsp; without his or their&nbsp; written&nbsp; consent." </blockquote>We believe that the above provision of law is completely applicable to&nbsp; the present case because there&nbsp; has&nbsp; been entered in the&nbsp; Transfer Certificate of Title&nbsp; No. 38065 an attachment lien which should&nbsp; not be&nbsp; maintained&nbsp; for&nbsp; it had lost its legal value and its&nbsp; annotation at&nbsp; the back of the said title&nbsp; will work to the prejudice of the true owner of the&nbsp; properties&nbsp; in question who,&nbsp; for value and&nbsp; in good faith,&nbsp; had acquired them at&nbsp; a legally conducted public auction sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; We hold that the matter in controversy has been properly&nbsp; brought in the original registration case under the provisions of Section 112 of&nbsp; the Land Registration Act mentioned above and&nbsp; pursuant to the ruling laid down in the case of&nbsp; Cavan <i>vs.</i> Wislizenus, 48&nbsp; Phil. 632.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; hereby affirmed<i> in toto,</i> with costs.<br><br><i>Paras C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista&nbsp; Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.&nbsp; B. L.</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.<br></div>
