				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT VS. ARTEMIO PERVEZ, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 8, 1958, the appellee Artemio Pervez was charged with attempted 
rape before the Justice of the Peace of San Miguel, Iloilo. After conducting the 
first and second stages of preliminary investigation, the Justice of the Peace, 
on January 30, 1959, dismissed the charge for insufficiency of evidence. 
Disagreeing with the findings of the Justice of the Peace, the Provincial 
Fiscal, on February 19, 1959, filed an information for attempted rape against 
Pervez in the Court of First Instance, certifying that he had conducted a 
preliminary investigation in accordance with Republic Act 732, as amended; that 
there is reasonable ground to believe that the offense charged has been 
committed, and that the accused is guilty thereof.
<p>On a motion to quash, the court below dismissed the information, sustaining 
the contention of the defense that after the dismissal by the Justice of the 
Peace, the Provincial Fiscal had no authority to file the information unless 
upon a new preliminary investigation, in which (more intimated than directly 
averred), the accused had the right to be present and submit his evidence; that 
Republic Act 732, as amended by Republic Act 1799, applies only to crime 
cognizable by the Court of First Instance <em>and filed directly with said 
court, not to those originally filed with the Justice of the Peace</em>. Cited 
for the above proposition are Villanueva, et al. <em>vs</em>. Hon. Gonzales, et 
al., 99 Phil., 679; 52 Off. Gaz., (12) 5497, and People <em>vs</em>. Magbanua, 
et al., C.A.-G. R. No. 19544-R, 54 Off. Gaz., 4500.</p>
<p>From the order quashing the information, the Government appeals, contending 
that under Republic Act 732, as amended, the Provincial Fiscal is properly 
authorized to conduct a preliminary investigation even without the presence of 
the accused who did not request to be present, regardless of whether it was 
originally filed with the Justice of the Peace or with said Provincial Fiscal; 
that the law itself does not make such distinction; that the Provincial Fiscal 
is not bound by the findings of the Justice of the Peace, and way conduct his 
own preliminary investigation, to be guided accordingly by the result 
thereof.</p>
<p>We find merit in the appeal. It can not seriously be disputed, and needs no 
citation of authorities,, that the Provincial Fiscal is not precluded from 
conducting his own preliminary investigation of a case previously dismissed by 
the Justice of the Peace, since such dismissal creates no bar to another 
prosecution. There is need only to determine whether he may do so without the 
presence of the accused. In a line of cases (Villanueva, et. al., <em>vs</em>. 
Hon. Gonzales, et al., <em>supra</em>.; Lozada <em>vs</em>. Hernandez, 92 Phil., 
1051; Rodriguez <em>vs</em>. Arellano, 96 Phil., 954; People <em>vs</em>. 
Napagao, 97 Phil., 785; 51 Off. Gaz., [11] 5634), this Court has repeatedly held 
that the legality of a preliminary investigation by the Provincial Fiscal, 
pursuant to Republic Act 732, as amended, is not affected by lack of previous 
notice to the accused, for said notice is required only after the accused 
requested to be present. It is not averred or shown tliat the accused herein had 
requested to be present; hence, the Provincial Fiscal was within his authority 
in conducting the investigation without the attendance of the accused. That 
there had been a previous dismissal by the Justice of the Peace of the same 
charge would not alter the above rule. Indeed, we see no substantial distinction 
between those cases originally investigated by the Justice of the Peace, <em>and 
dismissed by him</em>, and those originally investigated by the Provincial 
Fiscal (as in the <em>Villanueva</em> tmd <em>Napagao</em> cases, with respect 
to some of the accused), in both of which, before filing an information in 
court, the Provincial Fiscal has to rely on the result of his own investigation. 
If, in the latter cases, the Provincial Fiscal may conduct the investigation 
without the accused who did not request to be present, we see no reason for 
changing the rule where a Justice of the Peace, in a preliminary investigation, 
had previously dismissed the charge, when, as aforesaid, the findings of the 
Justice of the Peace do not bind the Provincial Fiscal. (Of course, where a 
Justice of the Peace forwards a case to the Court of First Instance with the 
finding that there is a <em>prima facie</em> case, the Fiscal cannot, on his own 
authority, dismiss the case, but should file with the court a motion to 
dismiss.)</p>
<p>We are cited to our ruling in Villanueva, et al., <em>vs</em>. Hon. Gonzales, 
et al., <em>supra</em>, in support of the proposition that Republic Act 732, as 
amended, does not apply to those cases originally filed and investigated by the 
Justice of the Peace, and, thereafter, forwarded to the Court of First Instance. 
This argument springs from a total misapprehension as to the real import of the 
<em>Villanueva</em> case. In that case, this Court ruled that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Republic Act 732 'governs preliminary investigations conducted by provincial 
fiscals in cases originally instituted by them in courts of first instance. It 
does not apply to cases begun in Justice of the Peace Courts and thereafter 
forwarded to the corresponding Court of First Instance . . . !"</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the ruling refers to those cases where the Justice of the Peace 
conducted the second stage of preliminary investigation, and found a <em>prima 
facie</em> case, or where the accused waived preliminary investigation therein. 
In such cases; the Provincial Fiscal <em>may</em> rely on the evidence presented 
in the Justice of the Peace, and is under no obligation to conduct an entirely 
new preliminary investigation. But certainly, there is nothing in said decision 
to justify the conclusion that after a previous dismissal by the Justice of the 
Peace, the Provincial Fiscal may not conduct a separate, independent 
investigation of his own, and this, without the presence of the accused, if the 
latter did not so request. In fact, the <em>Villanueva</em> case upheld the 
legality of the preliminary investigation conducted by the provincial fiscal 
with respect to one of the accused who was not among those originally 
investigated by the Justice of the Peace, and who was not given notice by the 
provincial fiscal in his own investigation.</p>
<p>In resume, we reiterate our previous rulings that if the charge for a crime 
cognizable by the Court of First Instance is filed by a competent party or 
officer in the Justice of the Peace Court, and the accused waives preliminary 
investigation therein, or the Justice of the Peace, after regular preliminary 
investigation, finds that a <em>prima facie</em> case exists, and consequently, 
elevates the records to the Court of First Instance, the Provincial Fiscal is 
not called upon to conduct another investigation, and may forthwith file the 
information in the Court of First Instance. Republic Act No. 732 does not apply 
in such a case. But if the Justice of the Peace, after due investigation, 
dismisses the charge, then the case stands as if no charge had been made, and 
the Provincial Fiscal may thereafter conduct his own investigation of the same 
charge under the aforesaid Republic Act 732, making it in the presence of the 
accused if and when the latter.so requests.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is reversed, with costs against the 
appellee.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera, 
Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Order reversed.</em></p></div>
