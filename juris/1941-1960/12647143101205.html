				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Certiorari against a decision of the Court of Industrial Relations  denying petitioner's claim for overtime  pay for its members.</p>
<p>The members whose claims for overtime pay were disapproved  by the court  testified that  they stayed  in  the barges of respondent for  fully 24  hours,  guarding  the barges and the equipment therein, with responsibility for these  in  case of  loss.   Many of  them  also  had  their families staying, sleeping and living  in  the  barges  with them.   Respondents in  an affidavit answer  alleged  that the claimants had not rendered overtime work; that said claimants,  at their own request, were allowed to stay, live and sleep in the barges without paying rentals, and that said privilege was extended as a  favor to them as there was nothing in the barge over which to keep guard.</p>
<p>The court found that when the  bargemen were required to work overtime, the patrons of the barges were issued dispatch tickets.  When the work was done, these dispatch tickets  were returned with the signature of the  patrons and of the parties who hired the barges or their representatives.  Sometimes the overtime work was entered by the patrons in their log books or  in  pieces of paper.  Upon the  submission  of  the  dispatch tickets signed as above indicated, or the pieces  of paper above set forth, payment of  overtime  work  would  be  made  upon  respondents' vouchers.</p>
<p>The court granted overtime to those who  proved  their claims  by  such dispatch tickets,  or records  of overtime work,  or  receipts,  but  denied  it to  those who  did not produce such or similar kinds of evidence,  or to those whose claims were based on their testimonies alone, without supporting papers such as those  mentioned above. Petitioner argues in  this Court that it was error for the court to ignore the uncontradicted and  corroborated parol evidence submitted by the claimants  of their overtime services rendered after the respondent company had failed to produce the dispatch tickets and bills  to customers for tug boats from the year 1947 to 1952.</p>
<p>It is  not true that the testimonies of the claimants  as to the  rendition by them of  overtime services was not contradicted.  According to  the  report  of  the  referee, most of the claims  for  overtime  pay  were based on the lact that  the  claimants stayed  in their barges for  24 hours.  Neither  is it  true  that  these  claims were not denied.  They were denied by respondent's answer, which explained,  under oath of respondents' manager,  that they stayed in the barges  at their own request.  Even without this explanation, the claim  that  the bargemen were  on a 24-hour  duty in thier barges only for  guarding purposes, is difficult to believe, even if not denied.   No barge owner would employ  bargemen on a 24-hour duty simply to stay,  sleep and live in the  barges with thier families. The court  was not bound to accept the testimonies of the bargemen;  their  inherent  probability  was  within the court's power to judge.  The court in  its discretion refused  to believe the  testimonies.   We believe its discretion was wisely exercised.</p>
<p>The validity of the argument that dispatch tickets existed merely  because  th  claimants  called for  them  by subpoena <span style="font-style: italic;">duces  tecum</span>  is beyond  our comprehension.  In order that the respondents may be considered as having suppressed the  tickets, the  existence of  these must first be approved.  Testimonies of bargemen that they served is no  evidence  of  the  existence of  dispatch tickets.  And failure to produce supposed documents alone,  is no reason for giving  credence to  incredible testimony.</p>
<p>The petitioner must have been  induced to take this appeal because of the statement of the court that majority of  the  claimants  failed "to offer  any competent proof to  sustain their claims.  The  court did  not mean that the oral testimonies  of the witnesses were  incompetent or  inadmissible.  What it means  is that  their evidence was <em>not satisfactory,</em> not sufficient to persuade the court of  the validity  of the claims or the quantum thereof. The court,  therefore,  did not ignore the said testimonies; it only refused to believe them, in view of their improbability and in the absence of the most competent proof of the rendition of the services, namely the dispatch tickets, records,  and receipts.  Neither did  it rule thereby that Government Service Insurance System <em>vs.</em> Vda. de Say son overtime  pay  can be proved  by  documentary  evidence alone.</p>
<p>On the whole we are satisfied that the court<em> a quo</em> did not  refuse  to admit  the  parol evidence submitted,  as claimed,  and  committed no abuse of discretion  in  its appraisal.</p>
<p>The petition is  denied, with costs.</p>
