<p>"5. On or about July 16, 1956 the plaintiff, through its counsel, Atty. 
Marcelino C. Ilao informed the defendant, by letter, that 'we are willing to pay 
such amount subtracting therewith the following municipal license fees, to wit 
(<em>a</em>) Transportation by land Class A (214) units—F750.00; <em>b</em>) 
Motor Vehicle Depository Class A (more than 2,160 square meters)—P412.50, the 
total of which amount to PI,162.50. We earnestly believe that the aforementioned 
municipal license fees should not be imposed on us on the ground that the law 
does not empower municipal corporations to impose municipal license fees upon 
enterprises operating transportation business.' A true copy of the 
aforementioned letter is hereto attached marked Annex 'A' and made an integral 
part of this Stipulation :</p>
<p>"6. On or about July 17f 1956, the defendant rejected the objection of the 
plaintiff in a letter addressed to the plaintiff, and reiterated his demand for 
the payment of the total amount of P2.582.50. A true copy of the letter 
aforementioned is hereto attached marked Annex 'B' and made an integral part of 
this Stipulation;</p>
<p>"7. On or about August 6, 1956 plaintiff paid the sum of P2,582.50, which 
payment was accompanied by a letter dated August 4, 1956, a true copy of which 
is attached hereto is Annex 'C and made an integral part of this 
Stipulation;</p>
<p>"8. Plaintiff has demanded from defendant the refund of the total amount of 
P2.582.50, but despite repeated demands, defendant lias failed and refused, and 
still refuses to refund the same;</p>
<p>"9. The storages of gasoline and crude oil, mentioned in paragraph 4 hereof, 
are used exclusively for the operation of the above-mentioned public utility 
concern owned and operated by the plaintiff;</p>
<p>"10. The ordinance No. 2673 of Quezon City, the validity of which is in 
question reads as follows (in so far as material to this case);</p>
<p>" 'Chapter XVI, Section 2-Fees-There shall be paid and collected for each 
license granted for storage of any explosive or combustible substance as herein 
provided, an annual license fee as follows;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * </p>
<p>Gasoline more than 5,000 but not more than 50,000 gallons P1,600.00 Other 
substances not mentioned herein * * * over 1,000 gallons..200.00</p>
<p>"'Chapter XXII, Sec. 3-Fees-There shall be paid for every license granted to 
pay operator of any public utility conveyance mentioned in Section 1 hereof, the 
following annual license fees in addition to the depository of said public 
utility vehicles; Class A-Public conveyance operating 100 or more vehicle f 
1,000.00 Establishment or depositing any of the motor vehicles mentioned above 
according to space:<br></p>
<p>Sub-Section A-2</p>
<p>Class A with space of more than 2,160 square meters 550.00' 
"</p></blockquote>
<p>From a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the refund sought and 
declaring Section 2, Chapter XVI, and Section 3, Chapter XXII, of Ordinance No. 
2673 of Quezon City null and void, the defendant has appealed. It is contended 
that Section 12, Sub-sections (<em>c</em>) and (<em>d</em>), of the Revised 
Charter of Quezon City (Rep. Act No. 537) empowers the council to enact 
ordinances or pass resolutions, on the matter of taxing, fixing Ihe license 
fees, and regulating the business of transportation companies and agencies, 
public vehicles, and storage and sale of gasoline and other combustible 
products. To quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 12. <em>General powers and duties of the council</em>.-The City Council 
shall have power by ordinance or resolution:</p>
<p>"(<em>c</em>) To tax, fix the license fee, and regulate the business of the 
following: * * * transportation companies and agencies; * * * public vehicle * * 
* the storage and sale of * * * oil, gasoline, * * * or any of the products 
thereof and of all other highly combustible or explosive materials, * * *.</p>
<p>"(<em>d</em>) * * * to regulate the storage and sale of * * * oil, gasoline * 
* * or any of the products thereof and of all other highly combustible or 
explosive materials."</p></blockquote>
<p>The provisions relied upon by the appellant reveal the indubitable purpose of 
authorizing impositions on business or transactions involving profit. 
Particularly, the use of the conjunction "and" between "storage" and "sale" in 
subsections (c) and (d) necessarily implies that the powers conferred on the 
city council is with reference to the storage and sale of gasoline or other 
combustible materials, not merely to the storage of gasoline and crude oil by 
the appellee for the latter's exclusive use and consumption. Section 2, Chapter 
XVI, of Ordinance No. 2673, being in contravention of that authority, is 
therefore null and void.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the appellant insists that the council is empowered by the City 
Charter (Republic Act No. 537) "to tax, fix the license fee, and regulate the 
business of * * * establishments for the storage of highly combustible or 
explosive materials, * * * and other establishments likely to endanger the 
public safety or give rise to conflagration or explosions * * *." (Sec. 12, Par. 
[c]) There is likewise no merit in this observation, since the power thus 
granted refers only to the business of (Storing highly combustible or explosive 
materials, and the appellee is unquestionably not engaged in said business. It 
is noteworthy that Section 2, Chapter XVI, of Ordinance No. 2673 imposes a 
license fee upon storage, not upon the business of storage.</p>
<p>It is well-established that "subordinate entities like municipal councils can 
exercise the power of taxation only to the extent specified by law; and this 
power cannot be extended by strained implications." (<em>See</em> Hercules 
Lumber Co. <em>vs</em>. Municipality of Zamboanga, et al., 55 Phil., 653, 655) ; 
and that "legislative powers in regard to taxes and licenses are not inherent in 
municipal corporations but must be granted by statute either expressly or by 
necessary implication," and "like other delegated powers, they are subject to 
strict construction." (<em>See</em> Cu Unkieng <em>vs</em>. Patstone, 42 Phil., 
818.)</p>
<p>The other phase of this case deals with the license fees imposed on the 
transportation business of the appellee. This aspect of the case involves the 
question whether Sec. 12 (<em>c</em>) of the Revised Charter of Quezon City 
conflicts with and, hence has been, repealed by Section 17 of Republic Act No. 
587 which amended subsection (<em>b</em>) of Section 70, of the Revised Motor 
Vehicles Law. The appellee sustains the affirmative and, we think, correctly. 
Section 17 of Republic Act No. 587 provides that "no other taxes or fees than 
those prescribed in this Act shall be imposed for the registration or operation, 
or on the owner of any motor vehicle, or for the exercise of the profession of 
chauffeur, by any municipal corporation, the provisions of any city charter to 
the contrary notwithstanding." Being a later enactment, it must be deemed to 
have repealed <em>pro tanto</em> Section 12 (<em>c</em>) of Republic Act No. 
537, the Revised Charter of Quezon City. The business of transportation 
comprises simply the operation of motor vehicles defined in the Revised Motor 
Vehicles Law (Section 3 of Article 11) as including "all vehicles using the 
public highways, if propelled by any power other than muscular power". To tax or 
impose a license fee on the transportation business of the appellee is therefore 
to tax or impose a license fee on the operation by the appellee of its vehicles, 
already exclusively covered by the Revised Motor Vehicles Law.</p>
<p>From the stipulation of facts it appears that, in the letter of the appellee 
dated July 16, 1956, he informed the appellant about his willingness to pay the 
amount (P2,582.50) demanded as fees, after deducting P750.00 charged as license 
fee for "Transportation by land Class A (214) units", and P412.00 for "Motor 
Vehicle Depository Class A (more than 2,160 square meters)," or a total of 
P1,162.50. The appellant having refused to accede to the proposal, the appellee 
in his communication of August 4, 1956, paid in check the amount of P2,582.50 
under protest and stated that he was "contesting the legality of the imposition 
on the ground that municipal corporations are inhibited from imposing license 
fees for the operation of motor vehicle for hire and compensation." From what 
the appellee had thus said and done, we are constrained to hold that the payment 
under protest referred only to the two items of P750.00 and P412.50; and this is 
obvious not only from his first letter but also from the specific ground invoked 
in support of the protest, namely, that a municipal corporation has no power to 
impose license fees on the operation of motor vehicles for hire or 
compensation-meaning undoubtedly appellee's transportation business which of 
course includes the motor vehicle depository. It results that the other items 
covered by appellee's remittance of August 4, 1956, were voluntarily paid and 
may not be recovered (Sec. 63, Republic Act No. 537; see also Visayan Electric 
Co., S. A. <em>vs</em>. City of Dumaguete, et al., 102 Phil., 566).</p>
<p>Wherefore, it being understood that the appellant is ordered to refund to the 
appellee the sum of Pl,162.50 instead of 12,582.50, the judgment appealed from 
is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera, Gutierrez David</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed</em>.</p></div>
