				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila sentencing&nbsp; Jesus&nbsp; O. Hiponia and the Far Eastern Surety &amp; Insurance Co.,&nbsp; Inc. to pay plaintiff, jointly and severally, the sum of P2,778.90, plus legal&nbsp; in- terest&nbsp; thereon from&nbsp; December 21, 1949, and&nbsp; dismissing the cross-complaint of said&nbsp; company&nbsp; with respect to&nbsp; its co-defendant, Juan C. Capalad. The Manila Terminal Co.,&nbsp; Inc., hereinafter referred to as plaintiff, was a contractor and operator of&nbsp; the government arrastre service in the port of Manila,&nbsp; while Jesus O.&nbsp; Hiponia was a&nbsp; custom broker engaged in brokerage business in the City of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; To expedite the delivery of goods,&nbsp; wares and merchandise to Hiponia in connection with&nbsp; his&nbsp; customs brokerage business, plaintiff&nbsp; required that he&nbsp; posts arrastre&nbsp; bonds to secure&nbsp; the payment of arrastre charges that may be due against him.&nbsp; In&nbsp; compliance&nbsp; with this requirement, Hiponia posted on&nbsp; March 6,&nbsp; 1947&nbsp; an&nbsp; arrastre&nbsp; bond&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Guaranty Co,, Inc. in the amount of P5,000, to expire on December&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1947 to&nbsp; guarantee the payment&nbsp; of "all arrastre and other charges that may have accrued or may be due&nbsp; on all&nbsp; and every goods, "wares and merchandise which may be imported into, or exported from, the&nbsp; Philippine Islands" by Hiponia "upon export and import permits issued to him."<br><br>On April 8,&nbsp; 1947,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; again required Hiponia&nbsp; to post a second arrastre bond&nbsp; and the same company again issued a second arrastre bond in the amount&nbsp; of P10,000 in favor of plaintiff under the same terms and conditions set forth in the first arrastre bond.&nbsp; As plaintiff required Hiponia&nbsp; to post another arrastre bond, on May 29, 1947, the Far&nbsp; Eastern Surety &amp; Insurance Co.,&nbsp; Inc. posted the third bond in the amount of P5,000 under the same terms and&nbsp; conditions set forth in the first and&nbsp; second bonds. <br><br>It&nbsp; appears that Hiponia&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; the arrastre and other charges&nbsp; in the amount of P11,2315.58 over a period of from March 6, 1947 to December 31, 1947 and so it required Hiponia and the sureties to pay the same. Out&nbsp; of said claim, the Philippine Guaranty Co., Inc. paid the sum&nbsp; of P8,486.68 and Hiponia the sum of P50, leaving a balance of P2,778.90.&nbsp; It is this balance which plaintiff now seeks to collect from the&nbsp; Far Eastern Surety Insurance Co.,&nbsp; Inc. primarily and, in the alternative,&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Philippine Guaranty Co., Inc., jointly and severally,&nbsp; with Jesus O. Hiponia. <br><br>Defendant Hiponia, having&nbsp; failed to answer,, was declared in default.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two&nbsp; sureties filed their respective answers after&nbsp; their motions to dismiss&nbsp; were denied&nbsp; by the court.&nbsp;&nbsp; On August 14, 1950, the Far&nbsp; Eastern&nbsp; Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; amended&nbsp; answer&nbsp; with&nbsp; a view to&nbsp; including&nbsp; a cross-complaint&nbsp; against Jesus&nbsp; O. Hiponia and Juan C. Capalad based on the fact that they&nbsp; executed in its i'avor an indemnity agreement to indemnify it against any&nbsp; damage which it may sustain&nbsp; for&nbsp; haying issued&nbsp; an arrastre bond&nbsp; in&nbsp; behalf of. Jesus&nbsp; O. Hiponia. Hiponia did not answer this cross-complaint.&nbsp; On his part, Capalad answered&nbsp; alleging that he only acted as a witness in&nbsp; said indemnity agreement and so he cannot bo&nbsp; held liable.&nbsp;&nbsp; After trial, the court rendered judgment as stated in&nbsp; the&nbsp; early part of this&nbsp; decision.<br><br>After this case was&nbsp; taken to the Court of Appeals, the latter certified the case to us on the ground that the question raised&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal is purely one of law.<br><br>The&nbsp; only question involved in&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; is whether appellant&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; held answerable&nbsp; for the&nbsp; balance&nbsp; of P778.90&nbsp; as part&nbsp; of the arrastre charges which Hiponia had failed to pay&nbsp; to plaintiff under its&nbsp; bond&nbsp; executed&nbsp; on May 29, 1947,&nbsp; it&nbsp; appearing that the same&nbsp; can be fully covered by the two bonds previously executed by the other surety&nbsp; in favor of the&nbsp; plaintiff. <br><br>It appears that three&nbsp; arrastre bonds&nbsp; were executed in favor of appellee to&nbsp; guarantee all arrastre charges that&nbsp; may be due from&nbsp; Hiponia and which he may&nbsp; fail&nbsp; to pay to appellee: one for P5,000&nbsp; dated&nbsp; March 6,&nbsp; 1947 executed by the&nbsp; Philippine Guaranty Co., Inc.; another for 1*10,000 executed by the same&nbsp; company on April 8, 1947, and a third for&nbsp; P5,000&nbsp; executed&nbsp; on May 29,&nbsp; 1947&nbsp; by the Far Eastern Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.&nbsp; It&nbsp; also&nbsp; appears that the total&nbsp; arrastre charges&nbsp; that&nbsp; accrued&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of appellee amounts to P11,315.58 and that, while the&nbsp; Philippine Guaranty&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc. paid its proportionate share&nbsp; of P8,486.68&nbsp; under its bonds, the Far Eastern Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc. refused to pay the balance of P2,778.90. <br><br>The&nbsp; refusal of this company to&nbsp; pay this balance is pre- dicated on two grounds:&nbsp; (1) when&nbsp; it executed its bond on May 29, 1947,&nbsp; it did so&nbsp; with&nbsp; the understanding that it will&nbsp; only be liable&nbsp; thereon after&nbsp; the first&nbsp; two bonds previously executed&nbsp; would&nbsp; be . found insufficient&nbsp; to pay the charges that may be due from Jesus 0. Hiponia,&nbsp; and (2)&nbsp; the balance of P2,778.90 due from Hiponia had already accrued when&nbsp; it executed said bond&nbsp; and, therefore, the same&nbsp; is not covered&nbsp; by&nbsp; it&nbsp; since it&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be given a retroactive&nbsp; effect.<br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp; first ground does not&nbsp; find&nbsp; support in the&nbsp; evidence. There&nbsp; is nothing in the bond executed by appellant from which&nbsp; it may be inferred&nbsp; that it&nbsp; undertook to answer for the&nbsp; arrastre charges that may be due from Hiponia&nbsp; only in case the two&nbsp; bonds&nbsp; previously executed would&nbsp; be in- sufficient&nbsp; to cover them.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the&nbsp; contrary,&nbsp; that&nbsp; under&nbsp; taking&nbsp; appears&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; distinct&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; separate&nbsp; from the undertaking of the&nbsp; other surety&nbsp; and&nbsp; it should&nbsp; therefore be considered&nbsp; exclusively&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; its terms and&nbsp; conditions.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this&nbsp; respect, we&nbsp; find&nbsp; correct&nbsp; the&nbsp; following findings of the court <i>a&nbsp; quo</i>: <br><blockquote> * * * A&nbsp; perusal of Exhibit 'C reveals the faet&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Far Kastern Surety&nbsp; &amp; Insurance&nbsp; Company,&nbsp; Inc. bound&nbsp; itself&nbsp; to pay, jointly and severally with Jesus 0. Hiponia, all arrastre and&nbsp; other changes that may&nbsp; havo arisen or which may fall due. on&nbsp; all and every goods, ware and merchandise which&nbsp; may be imported&nbsp; into, or exported from the&nbsp; Philippines by Jesus O. Hiponia up to December 31, 1947.&nbsp; It does&nbsp; not mention anything about the arrastre bonds, Exhibits 'A' and 'B' executed&nbsp; by plaintiff Philippine&nbsp; Guaranty&nbsp; Company, Inc.&nbsp; It cannot, therefore, be claimed that the liability assumed by the surety under Exhibit 'C is&nbsp; a subsidiary to the&nbsp; liability assumed by the&nbsp; surety in&nbsp; Exhibits 'A' and 'B'&nbsp; The .relationship between the parties as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiponia&nbsp; and&nbsp; the Philippine Guaranty Company,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; are solidarily liable to the plaintiff for arrastre charges up&nbsp; to December 31,&nbsp; 1947 in the sum of&nbsp; P15,000. Hiponia and the Far Eastern Surety&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Insurance Company, Inc., in a separate and&nbsp; independent obligation, are solidarily&nbsp; liable in. favor of the plaintiff for&nbsp; arrastre charges up to December 31, 1947 in the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P5,000.&nbsp; But&nbsp; the surety&nbsp; in&nbsp; Exhibits 'A'&nbsp; and&nbsp; 'B' has&nbsp; nothing whatsoever to do with, the liability of&nbsp; the surety in Exhibit 'C.&nbsp; Likewise,&nbsp; the&nbsp; surety in Exhibit 'C has nothing&nbsp; to do with the liability of the surety in. Exhibits 'A' and 'B,:"</blockquote>The&nbsp; second&nbsp; ground&nbsp; requires&nbsp; an&nbsp; examination of&nbsp; the bond executed by appellant, the pertinent portion&nbsp; of which we quote: <br><blockquote>"The condition of this bond&nbsp; is such, that if the above-bounden principal&nbsp; shall&nbsp; well and truly pay, or cause to be paid unto the above-named&nbsp; MANILA TERMINAL company, inc.,&nbsp; all&nbsp; the arrastre and other&nbsp; charges that may have&nbsp; arisen or due on all&nbsp; and every goods, wares and merchandises which&nbsp; may be imported&nbsp; into or exported from&nbsp; the Philippine Islands&nbsp; by&nbsp; the above-bounden principal upon export or import permits issued to&nbsp; him, then this obligation shall he void; otherwise to remain&nbsp; in full force and effect." </blockquote>Before we&nbsp; proceed, a&nbsp; little digression is necessary on the nature&nbsp; and extent of the liability&nbsp; of a&nbsp; surety.&nbsp;&nbsp; In El Vencedor vs.&nbsp; Canlas, 44 Phil., 699, this Court said: "The rule is&nbsp; well known that a bond or contract of suretyship is strictly&nbsp; construed and cannot&nbsp; be extended beyond its specified limits (Civil&nbsp; Code, Article 1827).&nbsp; It is not retrospective&nbsp; and no liability attaches for defaults occurring before it is entered into&nbsp; unless .an intent to be&nbsp; so&nbsp; liable is indicated."&nbsp;&nbsp; In a later case, this Court also said: "Bonds or other contracts of suretyship&nbsp; are&nbsp; ordinarily not&nbsp; to be construed as&nbsp; retrospective, but that rule must yield to the intention of the contradicting parties as revealed by the evidence, and does&nbsp; not interfere&nbsp; with the&nbsp; application of the&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; tests&nbsp; and&nbsp; canons&nbsp; followed&nbsp; in the&nbsp; interpretation of&nbsp; other&nbsp; contracts"&nbsp; (Bank&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands vs.&nbsp; Foerster, 49 Phil., 843).<br><br>Considering that&nbsp; the arrastre&nbsp; charges which&nbsp; are now demanded&nbsp; from appellant had&nbsp; already accrued when the if&nbsp; company executed its bond on&nbsp; May 29, 1947 in&nbsp; favor of appellee, it follows&nbsp; that in line with&nbsp; the principle above enunciated,&nbsp; appellant cannot&nbsp; be held&nbsp; liable therefor, because its bond cannot be&nbsp; given a retroactive effect unless an intent to be so liable clearly appears from the evidence. Here such&nbsp; intention does&nbsp; not appear clear.&nbsp; While&nbsp; the bond&nbsp; states that it&nbsp; shall answer for "all the arrastre and other charges that&nbsp; may&nbsp; have&nbsp; arisen&nbsp; or due" from&nbsp; the principal debtor, such sentence is however qualified by the following words "on all and every goods, wares and merchandise which <i>may be</i> imported into,&nbsp; or&nbsp; exported from, the Philippine Islands", which give the connotation that the undertaking only covers charges that may accrue in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied)&nbsp; The&nbsp; least&nbsp; that we&nbsp; can&nbsp; say is&nbsp; that&nbsp; the wording of the bond is ambiguous or equivocal and as such it cannot be considered as an exception to the rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; And considering that a&nbsp; contract of suretyship is strictly construed against the creditor when the intention of the parties&nbsp; is not clearly expressed, we&nbsp; have no other alternative&nbsp; than to hold that appellant is&nbsp; not liable for the payment of the amount claimed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; In this respect, we find erroneous&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision of the lower court.<br><br>The decision appealed from should therefore be modified in the sense that the action should be dismissed&nbsp; in so far as&nbsp; appellant is&nbsp; concerned.&nbsp; The rest&nbsp; of the&nbsp; decision as regards&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Jesus&nbsp; O. Hiponia&nbsp; should&nbsp; stand.&nbsp; No pronouncement as&nbsp; to&nbsp; costs. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; A., Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.B.L</i>., and <i>Endencia, JJ.</i>, concur. </div>
