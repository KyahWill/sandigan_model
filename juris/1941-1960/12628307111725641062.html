				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The&nbsp; intestate&nbsp; estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Fausto Bayot, represented by Celeste&nbsp; Bayot,&nbsp; judicial administratrix,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an application with the Court of First Instance of Masbate for the registration&nbsp; under&nbsp; Act No. 496 of&nbsp; a&nbsp; parcel of&nbsp; land in the barrio of Potot, municipality of Milagros, Masbate, containing an area of 11,354,093 square meters, with an alternative prayer that. it&nbsp; also be&nbsp; given&nbsp; the benefit&nbsp; of Chapter VIII of Commonwealth Act No. 141 on the ground that it had&nbsp; been in&nbsp; "peaceful&nbsp; possession under claim&nbsp; of ownership, exclusive of any right,&nbsp; by itself and through its&nbsp; predecessor-in-interest, since time immemorial, having dedicated the land&nbsp; for pasture and other&nbsp; agricultural uses."<br><br>The&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands&nbsp; opposed the petition&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that neither the applicant nor its predecessor-in-interest possess sufficient title which would entitle them to&nbsp; the land, the same not having&nbsp; been acquired&nbsp; either by&nbsp; composition title&nbsp; from the Spanish Government or by possessory information under the&nbsp; Royal Decree of&nbsp; February 13, 1894, and that&nbsp; said land&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; portion of the public&nbsp; domain belonging to the Republic.<br><br>After&nbsp; the reception&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the evidence, the court&nbsp; rendered judgment ordering the&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; entire land applied for, whereupon the Director of Lands&nbsp; took the present&nbsp; appeal.<br><br>On November 10, 1883, one Natividad Perez was granted title by the&nbsp; Spanish&nbsp; Government&nbsp; to a parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; with an&nbsp; area of&nbsp; 151 hectares,&nbsp; 47 ares and&nbsp; 80 centares, the boundaries of which are: "Norte con el Monte Layat,&nbsp; al Este con el&nbsp; rio Potot, al Sur eon la playa de la ensenada Asid y&nbsp; al Oeste con el rio&nbsp; Buracay."&nbsp; On&nbsp; November 20, 1920, Lucas Bayot bought said parcel of land from Isabelo Bordeos, grandson of Natividad, for the sum of P200.&nbsp; On November 30, 1920,&nbsp; Lucas&nbsp; Bayot sold the&nbsp; land to Fausto Bayot&nbsp; for the&nbsp; sum of P300.&nbsp; On November&nbsp; 29,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1920 Fausto Bayot declared the land for taxation stating under oath that its area is 151 hectares, 47 ares and 80 centares and its value P1.520.&nbsp; On August 28, 1928, Fausto Bayot again&nbsp; declared the land for taxation this time increasing the area to 1,085 hectares, 52 ares and 20 centares.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter&nbsp; Fausto Bayot had the land surveyed by one Gervacio Aguinaldo,&nbsp; a private&nbsp; surveyor,&nbsp; who&nbsp; stated in the&nbsp; plan prepared by him that the area is 11,354,093 square meters. Thereupon,&nbsp; a new declaration of the land for the&nbsp; year 1931 'was made&nbsp; and this time its&nbsp; area was&nbsp; once more increased to 1,13S hectares.<br><br>The applicant tried to show that in 1910 one&nbsp; Pascual Bacolod&nbsp; used to&nbsp; pass through the land in question and saw some cattle&nbsp; there&nbsp; which,&nbsp; according to his information,&nbsp; belonged to&nbsp; Natividad&nbsp; Perez;&nbsp; that&nbsp; when&nbsp; Isabelo Bordeos&nbsp; sold&nbsp; the land to Lucas&nbsp; Bayot on November 20, 1920,&nbsp; the former told the latter that Natividad&nbsp; was&nbsp; in possession of the same as owner, and that the land was dedicated to the pasture of large&nbsp; cattle.<br><br>Abraham&nbsp; Aganan declared that from 1920 to 1930&nbsp; he was the&nbsp; overseer of Fausto Bayot in the land which was dedicated to&nbsp; the&nbsp; raising of cattle;&nbsp; that&nbsp; Fausto&nbsp; placed therein in&nbsp; 1920&nbsp; 170 heads of cattle;&nbsp; that&nbsp; this&nbsp; number reached&nbsp; 3,000 but when he (Aganan)&nbsp; turned over the management to&nbsp; Ariastacio Zurbito in 1930 this&nbsp; number was reduced to 400 because of&nbsp; rinderpest; that Fausto constructed&nbsp; thereon a house with galvanized iron&nbsp; roofing, a warehouse and a torril, and that the land was enclosed with barbed wires.<br><br>Anastacio Zurbito testified that he succeeded&nbsp; Abraham Aganan&nbsp; as&nbsp; overseer&nbsp; in&nbsp; 1931; that the 400&nbsp; heads&nbsp; that were turned over to&nbsp; him by Aganan increased to&nbsp; 1,010 during the&nbsp; Japanese occupation;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Japanese took the cattle and burned the house&nbsp; of Faosto; that&nbsp; he left the place in 1946&nbsp; when&nbsp; all&nbsp; the cattle existing there was gone;&nbsp; that Vicente Oliva occupied a&nbsp; portion of the land in 1946; that after the&nbsp; cattle was gone he&nbsp; planted rice and camotes over&nbsp; an area of about three hectares; that two other&nbsp; also&nbsp; tilled portions&nbsp; of the land and the total area tilled, is about six hectares.<br><br>Vicente Oliva, a witness for the opposition, testified that on&nbsp; December 8, 1948 he&nbsp; applied for a pasture permit to occupy a.portion of the land containing 245 hectares; and that this portion is included in the land now applied for; this witness indicating the&nbsp; place where&nbsp; Bayot kept his. cattle,&nbsp; the spot&nbsp; where his&nbsp; house&nbsp; was&nbsp; erected, and the portion covered by the&nbsp; barbed wire&nbsp; fence.<br><br>The&nbsp; question to be determined is whether the applicant is entitled to the registration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land it is applying for containing&nbsp; an area&nbsp; of&nbsp; 1,135&nbsp; hectares even&nbsp; if the Spanish&nbsp; Government only mentions an&nbsp; area of 151 hectares, 47&nbsp; ares and 80 centares.<br><br>As may be&nbsp; noted,&nbsp; the land&nbsp; applied for&nbsp; involves&nbsp; an increase&nbsp; of more than seven times the area stated&nbsp; in the Spanish&nbsp; title&nbsp; obtained by&nbsp; its&nbsp; original owner, but&nbsp; this notwithstanding, the lower&nbsp; court chose&nbsp; to adjudicate the entire&nbsp; land taking shelter under the&nbsp; ruling in the&nbsp; cases of&nbsp; Escudero and Marasigan <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Director of&nbsp; Lands,&nbsp; 44 Phil, 83, and&nbsp; Government of&nbsp; the Philippine Islands&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Abaja, 52 Phil.,&nbsp; 261.&nbsp; The first case held&nbsp; that&nbsp; "* * * that which really&nbsp; defines a piece of ground&nbsp; is not the area calculated with more&nbsp; or&nbsp; less certainty,&nbsp; mentioned in its description, but the boundaries therein laid down as inclosing the land and indicating&nbsp; its limits *&nbsp; * *", and the second that "when the boundaries are certain and no alteration&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; has been proven, the area included within such boundaries shall prevail over that which the title shows."<br><br>We have no quarrel with the ruling&nbsp; laid down&nbsp; in the cases mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, many more could be&nbsp; cited holding that what really defines a piece of&nbsp; land&nbsp; is not the area mentioned in its description but rather the&nbsp; boundaries therein laid down.&nbsp; As&nbsp; stated in the case of&nbsp; Loyola&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Bartolome (1919), 39 Phil., 544, "It is not of vital consequence that&nbsp; a deed or contract&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sale of land should&nbsp; declare the area with mathematical&nbsp; accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp; sufficient if its extent is&nbsp; objectively indicated&nbsp; with sufficient precision to enable one to identify it; and where the boundaries given are&nbsp; adequate for this purpose,&nbsp; an error as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; superficial area&nbsp; is immaterial."<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]&nbsp;</span></sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">But a careful review of the applicable&nbsp; case&nbsp; wrf&amp;l&nbsp; show tliat it is only when the .boundaries&nbsp; given are sufficiently certain Â¦ and the identity of the&nbsp; land clearly proved by the boundaries thus indicated that an erroneous statement concerning the area, can be disregarded&nbsp; or&nbsp; ignored..&nbsp; Otherwise, the area stated should be followed</span>&nbsp; (Sanchez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Director of Lands,&nbsp; 63 Phil.,&nbsp; 378,&nbsp; 386).&nbsp; This is&nbsp; the&nbsp; exception to the. rule. This can be better seen by mentioning some illustrative&nbsp; cases.<br><br>In the case of Pamintuan <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Insular Government (1907), 8 Phil.,&nbsp; 512,&nbsp; it appears that the Spanish Government made a grant of&nbsp; 92 hectares and&nbsp; 10&nbsp; ares of public&nbsp; land to. the&nbsp; ancestors&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner,&nbsp; however, claimed in his application&nbsp; 626 hectares,&nbsp; 38&nbsp; ares, and&nbsp; 95 centares of&nbsp; land.&nbsp; This Court said:&nbsp; "While the proposition of&nbsp; law&nbsp; laid down by the court&nbsp; below&nbsp; may&nbsp; be true to the&nbsp; effect that natural boundaries&nbsp; will&nbsp; prevail&nbsp; over area, yet&nbsp; when the land sought to be registered is almost seven times&nbsp; as much&nbsp; as that&nbsp; described&nbsp; in the&nbsp; deed,&nbsp; the evidence as&nbsp; to natural boundaries must be very&nbsp; clear and convincing before that rule can be&nbsp; applied.&nbsp;&nbsp; No such evidence was given in this&nbsp; case, and the judgment of the court below&nbsp; cannot stand."<br><br>In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Paras <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Insular Government&nbsp; (1908), 11 Phil., 878, petitioner likewise tried to prove his ownership of&nbsp; 67 hectares of land by presenting a patent&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Spanish&nbsp; Government covering&nbsp; only 43 hectares, but failed in&nbsp; view of the ruling&nbsp; already stated, and in the case of Carillo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Insular Government&nbsp; (1908), 11 Phil., 379, the petitioner also&nbsp; failed in his attempt to prove his ownership of 107 hectares of land by presenting a patent from the Spanish Government covering only 26 hectares, by virtue&nbsp; of the same ruling.<br><br>In the case of Waldroop <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Castaneda (1913), 25 Phil., 30,&nbsp; it&nbsp; appears that the&nbsp; Spanish&nbsp; Government conveyed to Hilario Castaneda 23 hectares, 11 ares and 12 centares of public&nbsp; land.&nbsp; This&nbsp; land&nbsp; was&nbsp; later' conveyed to&nbsp; petitioners.&nbsp; Due&nbsp; to lack of proof that the land which&nbsp; Castaneda had&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Government had natural boundaries sufficient to clearly segregate&nbsp; it from the adjoining lands, it&nbsp; was held that the&nbsp; only land to which the&nbsp; petitioners were entitled was the land which Castaneda had obtained from the Spanish Government.&nbsp; In this case, the&nbsp; following doctrine&nbsp; was&nbsp; laid&nbsp; down:&nbsp; "In&nbsp; order&nbsp; that natural boundaries&nbsp; of land may be accepted for the&nbsp; purpose of varying the extent&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; included in&nbsp; the deed of&nbsp; conveyance,&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; as&nbsp; to&nbsp; such natural boundaries must be clear and convincing.&nbsp; Such natural boundaries must be of. such&nbsp; a character as to definitely and&nbsp; accurately segregate&nbsp; the land in question from&nbsp; the adjoining&nbsp; property.&nbsp; There&nbsp; must&nbsp; be no&nbsp; doubt left&nbsp; that the&nbsp; land included within the natural boundaries is&nbsp; the same land which was intended to&nbsp; be&nbsp; sold by the deed of conveyance."<br><br>It should be recalled that the boundaries of the&nbsp; land which&nbsp; was originally acquired by Natividad Perez from the&nbsp; Spanish&nbsp; Government&nbsp; and which was later acquired by&nbsp; Fausto Bayot are&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; "Norte eon el Monte Layat,&nbsp; al&nbsp; Este con el&nbsp; rio Potot, al Sur&nbsp; con la playa da la ensenada Asid y al&nbsp; Oeste&nbsp; con el rio Buracay."&nbsp;&nbsp; While on the east, south, and west&nbsp; sides of the land&nbsp; it may be stated&nbsp; that the boundaries are&nbsp; definite&nbsp; and certain,&nbsp; the same cannot be said with regard to the boundary on the north&nbsp; which&nbsp; is Mt. Layat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; boundary on this&nbsp; side is indeed&nbsp; very vague and indefinite&nbsp; for&nbsp; it does not definitely and accurately segregate&nbsp; the&nbsp; land applied&nbsp; for from the adjoining&nbsp; property.&nbsp; It&nbsp; does&nbsp; not state&nbsp; where the Jand&nbsp; ends&nbsp; and the mountain begins.&nbsp; The&nbsp; enormous disparity&nbsp; in the area applied&nbsp; for and that stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Spanish title of its&nbsp; original owner can&nbsp; only&nbsp; be due&nbsp; to this indefiniteness in the&nbsp; northern part&nbsp; of the land which ia bordered by&nbsp; Mt. Layat.<br><br>There are other factors which weigh&nbsp; heavily against the claim of the applicant.&nbsp; One&nbsp; is that under the Royal Decrees in&nbsp; force at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time of the acquisition by Natividad Perez of the land in guestion no one could acquire public Jand&nbsp; in&nbsp; excess of 1,000 hectares&nbsp; (Royal Decree&nbsp; of November 25, 1880); (See Valdez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Director&nbsp; of Lands, 62&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 362).&nbsp; This&nbsp; Royal&nbsp; Decree provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; "La extension de los terrenog&nbsp; a los&nbsp; cuales&nbsp; se refiere dicho deereto, no&nbsp; podra exceder de <span style="font-style: italic;">mil hectareas para los terrenos de secano;</span> quinientos para los&nbsp; de igual clase poblados de&nbsp; arbolado maderable, y ciento&nbsp; para los clasificados en el artieulo 6." del mismo&nbsp; deereto con la frase 'que a poca costa puedan hacerse&nbsp; de regadio'"&nbsp; Another&nbsp; factor&nbsp; is that the lands&nbsp; of the public domain were as&nbsp; a rule&nbsp; sold only by unit of measure, that is&nbsp; to say, at a fixed price per hectare or per <span style="font-style: italic;">quiÃ±on</span> and not&nbsp; in the mass (cuerpos ciertos);&nbsp; (Valdez <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Director of Lands, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>) and "it should&nbsp; also&nbsp; be&nbsp; observed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the amount of&nbsp; permissible error in the measurement&nbsp; of&nbsp; public lands was only five per&nbsp; cent&nbsp; of the total&nbsp; area"&nbsp; (Royal&nbsp; Decree of January 19,&nbsp; 1883);&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sanchez&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lands, supra).<br><br>Verily,&nbsp; the&nbsp; land in question does&nbsp; not fit into the pattern. of the above requirements&nbsp; of&nbsp; pertinent royal&nbsp; decrees.<br><br>With regard to the contention that applicant&nbsp; can claim title to the&nbsp; entire land under Chapter VIII of&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 141 because it has&nbsp; been in peaceful&nbsp; possession&nbsp; thereof under&nbsp; claim of ownership, exclusive&nbsp; of any other right, by&nbsp; itself and through&nbsp; its predecessor- in-interest, since time immemorial, it should be noted that in order that this claim may&nbsp; be&nbsp; justified it is&nbsp; necessary to establish that the possession&nbsp; has been peaceful, open, continuous,&nbsp; adverse and under&nbsp; concept of&nbsp; owner s<span style="font-style: italic;">ince July 26, 1894</span>&nbsp; (Tiglao <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.&nbsp; Insular Government,&nbsp; 7 Phil., 80).&nbsp; This the applicant failed to prove because according to its evidence its earliest&nbsp; possession only dates&nbsp; as&nbsp; far back as&nbsp; 1910.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; appealed from,&nbsp; is&nbsp; modified in the&nbsp; sense that&nbsp; the applicant&nbsp; is&nbsp; only entitled to&nbsp; register 151&nbsp; hectares, 47 ares and&nbsp; 80 centares&nbsp; as stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the title&nbsp; obtained by applicant's predecessor-in-interest from the&nbsp; Spanish Government.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
