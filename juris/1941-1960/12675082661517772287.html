				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In the Court of First Instance of Manila 
appellant was Accused of, and pleaded guilty to, attempted bribery Forthwith he 
was sentenced to suffer two months and one day of <em>arresto mayor</em> and to 
pay a fine of P3, with subsidiary Imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 
the costs.<br><br>From that sentence he appealed to this Court, contending that 
(1) "the lower court erred in considering that the statement given by the 
accused during his arraignment to the court interpreter that he gave a peso to 
the complaining witness is a manifestation or a declaration of a plea of 
guilty," and (2) "the lower court erred In forthwith sentencing the accused to a 
prison term of two months and one day and to pay a fine if P3 on the day of the 
arraignment, without giving him a chance to defend himself."</p>Appellant's first assignment of error is premised upon allegations of fact 
which were not proven during the trial and do not appear in the record before 
us. We cannot sustain an assignment of error based on such allegations.
<p>The record shows that when the case was called for the arraignment of the 
accused on November 3, 1947, the accused waived his right to be assisted by 
counsel and then and there entered the plea of guilty. That plea necessarily 
foreclosed the right of the accused to defend himself and left the court with no 
other alternative than to impose the penalty prescribed by law. Therefore the 
second assignment of error is also devoid of merit.</p>
<p>The only questions for us to determine in this appeal are (1) the nature of 
the crime committed and (2) the propriety of the penalty imposed.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The offense charged in the information falls under article 212 of the Revised 
Penal Code, entitled "Corruption of Public Officials," in relation to the third 
paragraph of article 210 of the same Code. The trial court found the accused 
guilty of the crime charged in the information, according to the contention of 
the Solicitor General, is <em>frustrated</em> corruption of a public official. 
We note, however, that the penalty imposed by the trial court corresponds to 
that of <em>consummated</em> corruption of a public official, as penalized in 
article 212, in relation to the third paragraph of article 210, of the Revised 
Penal Code. Was the crime alleged in the information attempted, frustrated, or 
Consummated?</p>
<p>The information charged the appellant with attempted bribery, alleging that 
on September 23, 1947, in the city of Manila, he wilfully, unlawfully, and 
feloniously did offer and deliver the amount of one peso to Patrolman M. Garcia 
in order to dissuade him from complying with his duty of arresting said accused 
for a violation of City Ordinance No. 2646 and filing charges against him, 
adding, however (using the language of article 6 of the Revised Penal (Code, 
which defines an attempt to commit a felony), that "the said accused did not 
perform all the acts of execution which should have produced the crime of 
bribery as a consequence by reason of a cause other than his own voluntary 
desistance, that is, because the said police officer did not allow himself to be 
corrupted. This additional allegation seems to contradict the main allegation 
that the accused offered and delivered the money to the police officer. Be that 
as it may, and assuming that the accused really offered sand delivered the money 
to the police officer, there is no question that the latter refused to bo 
corrupted. In similar cases this court has repeatedly held the crime to be 
attempted. (U.S. <em>vs.</em> Paua, 6 Phil. 740; U.S. <em>vs.</em> Camacan, 7 
Phil. 329; U.S. <em>vs.</em> Tan Gee, 7 Phil. 738; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Sy-Suikao, 
18 Phil. 482; and U.S. <em>vs.</em> Te Tong, 26 Phil. 453.)</p>
<p>In the last of the cases herein cited, it appears that the accused Te Tong 
offered and delivered P500 to a police bfficer in consideration of the latter's 
agreeing to deliver to the Chinaman certain books, which the police officer had 
seized from hin and which showed that he was guilty of playing the prohibited 
game of jueteng, and to substitute said books with others fraudulently concocted 
for the purpose. Immediately after the delivery and substitution of the books 
and the receipt of P500, the police officer arrested the Chinaman. The court 
said that the only question was whether the crime was attempted, frustrated, or 
consummated bribery. Following the previous cases above cited, which Involved 
similar facts, the court held that "while there is some authority to the 
contrary, we are of the opinion that we should follow the substantially uniform 
holding of this court which declares the crime to be attempted bribery."</p>
<p>We do not feel inclined to disturb that ruling in this case in the absence of 
compelling reasons and in view of the ambiguity of the information to which the 
herein appellant pleaded guilty, which ambiguity should be resolved in this 
favor. We therefore hold that the crime committed was attempted corruption of a 
public official. </p>
</li><li>The penalty prescribed in the third paragraph of article 210, in relation to 
article 212, of the Revised Penal Code for the <em>consummated</em> crime of 
corruption of a public official is <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and 
maximum periods and a fine of not less than the value of the gift and not snore 
than three times such value. In accordance with article 51 of the Revised Penal 
Code, a penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed by law for the 
consummated felony should be imposed upon the principal in an attempt to commit 
a felony. Two degrees lower than <em>arresto mayor</em> in its medium and 
maximum periods is <em>destierro</em> in its minimum and medium periods. 
(Article 71, Revised Penal Code, as amended by section 3 of Commonwealth Act No. 
217.)
<p></p></li></ol>
<p>Conformably to articles 27 (paragraph 4) and 87 of the Revised Penal Code, 
the accused-appellant should be as he is hereby sentenced to suffer six months 
and one day of <em>destierro</em> or banishment, during which period he shall 
not be permitted to enter or be in any place within the radius of twenty-five 
kilometers from his present place of residence, 419 T. Pinpin, Manila. As thus 
modified, the sentence appealed from is affirmed in all respects, with costs.</p><p>SO
