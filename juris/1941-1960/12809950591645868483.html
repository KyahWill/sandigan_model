				<BR><BR><div align="justify">El Juzgado Municipal de Manila dicto sentencia el 5 de junio de 1946 en el 
asunto de desahucio, Pedro Santos contra Santos Contreras, condenando al ultimo 
a pagar al demandante la cantidad de P160 en concepto de alquiler de la casa 
ocupada durante los meses de abril y mayo de 1946 y la suma de P100 mensual 
correspondiente a los meses subsiguientes hasta que el demandado restituya la 
casa. Contra esta sentencia el demandado apelo para ante el Juzgado de Primera 
Instancia. No presento fianza de apelacion de P25, pero presto una 
<i>supersedeas bond</i> en la cantidad de P300 para responder de los alquileres, 
daños y costas.
<p>Desde julio de 1946, el demandado-apelante comenzo a depositar la cantidad de 
P100 mensual en la escribania del juzgado para el pago de los alquileres de la 
casa por los meses que vayan venciendo.</p>
<p>En 10 de octubre de 1946 el Juzgado de Primera Instancia dicto sentencia 
condenando al demandado a desalojar la casa y a pagar la cantidad de P40 para el 
mes de abril de 1946 y la cantidad de P100 mensual para mayo y meses 
subsiguientes hasta que el demandado haya desalojado la finca.</p>
<p>El 14 de noviembre de 1946 el demandado presento su mocion de nueva vista que 
fue denegada.</p>
<p>El 28 de noviembre de 1946 el demandado presento un escrito excepcionandose 
de la decision y anunciando su intencion de apelar para ante el Tribunal Supremo 
y al mismo tiempo presento su expediente de apelacion con señalamiento del dia 7 
de diciembre para su vista.</p>
<p>En 9 de diciembre de 1946 antes de actuar el Juzgado sobre la aprobacion del 
expediente de apelacion, el demandado presento una <i>supersedeas bond</i> en la 
cantidad de P400 para responder de los alquileres, daños y costas. En el mismo 
dia el Juzgado de Primera Instancia desaprobo el expediente de apelacion por la 
razon de que no ha sido perfeccionado de acuerdo con la regla 41.</p>
<p>El 16 de diciembre de 1946 el demandado presento una mocion de 
reconsideracion de la orden de 9 de diciembre y fue denegada el 24 del mismo 
mes.</p>
<p>El 20 de enero de 1947 el Juez ordeno la ejecucion de la sentencia.</p>
<p>Como recurrente, el demandado-apelante acude a este Tribunal en un recurso 
original de <i>mandamus</i> con un interdicto prohibitorio preliminar y pide que 
la orden del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila de 9 de diciembre de 1946 
desaprobando el expediente de apelacion sea revocada juntamente con la orden de 
24 de diciembre denegando su mocion de reconsideracion y que se ordene al mismo 
Juzgado que apruebe el expediente de apelacion.</p>
<p>Los recurridos sostienen que no se ha perfeccionado la apelacion porque el 
apelante no presto fianza de apelacion de P60 con infraccion de la Regla 41, 
articulo 5. Los recurridos no se percatan que el mismo articulo dice en parte 
"or unless a supersedeas bond is filed." Como se habia prestado ya una 
<i>supersedeas bond</i> en el Juzgado Municipal para responder de las rentas o 
daños y costas, la fianza de apelacion de P60 es innecesaria. Los recurridos 
alegan, ademas, que la <i>supersedeas bond</i>, segun como esta redactada, 
responde solamente de las costas en que pueda ser condenado el apelante en el 
Juzgado de Primera Instancia y no incluye las costas que el Tribunal Supremo 
pueda imponer contra el.</p>
<p>El recurrente contiende que su <i>supersedeas bond</i> de P300 ya le releva 
de su obligacion de prestar una fianza de apelacion de P60 al apelar contra la 
decision del Juzgado de Primera Instancia y como argumento invoca la decision en 
el asunto de Belmonte <i>contra</i> Marin (76 Phil., 198). El apelado Belmonte 
en dicha causa sostuvo que el Juzgado de Primera Instancia debio haber 
sobreseido la apelacion contra la decision del Juzgado Municipal porque el 
apelante Marin no presto fianza de apelacion de P25. (Regla 40, art. 3.) Este 
Tribunal dijo que como el demandado habia prestado ya una <i>supersedeas 
bond</i> en la cantidad de P80 para responder de las costas "hasta que se dicte 
sentencia definitiva," la prestacion de una fianza de apelacion era 
innecesaria.</p>
<p>En el asunto de Fernando <i>contra</i> De la Cruz (61 Jur. Fil., 460), cuando 
estaba en vigor aun el articulo 88 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil tal como 
fue enmendado por la Ley No. 4115, el Tribunal Supremo dijo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Debe observarse que es preciso que el demandado preste una fianza para el 
registro del asunto en el juzgado de primera instancia y para el pago de los 
alquileres, daños y perjuicios, y costas." En este ultimo caso no solamente 
perfecciona su apelacion sino que tambien suspende la ejecucion de la sentencia. 
En otras palabras, el demandado, que apela al juzgado de primera instancia, 
puede prestar una fianza para el pago de las costas solamente, o puede prestar 
una fianza para el pago de las rentas, daños y perjuicios, y costas. Es 
perfectamente evidente, por lo tanto, que la fianza para el pago de las rentas, 
daños y perjuicios, y costas incluye la obligacion de pagar las costas. ¿Por que 
habra de prestar dos fianzas para el pago de las costas? No se nos ha llamado la 
atencion a ninguna disposicion legal ni a ninguna decision de este Tribunal en 
que se requiera que el apelante preste una fianza separada por P50 para el pago 
de las costas cuando presta una fianza satisfactoria para el pago de rentas, 
daños y perjuicios, y costas. Por el contrario, la misma fraseologia de la ley, 
que dispone que si el demandado desea suspender la ejecucion de la sentencia 
mientras este pendiente la apelacion, debera prestar una fianza 'para el 
registro del asunto en el juzgado de primera instancia, y para el pago de los 
alquileres, daños y perjuicios, y costas,' parece prever la prestacion de una 
sola fianza, siempre que se preste dentro del plazo para la interposicion de la 
apelacion".</p></blockquote>
<p>El articulo 8 de la Regla 72 del Reglamento vigente dispone que:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Si se dictare sentencia contra el demandado, se expedira inmediatamente la 
ejecucion, a menos que se perfeccionare una apelacion y el demandado prestare 
fianza bastante para suspender la ejecucion de dicha sentencia, aprobada por el 
juez de paz o municipal y otorgada en favor del demandante para el registro de 
la causa en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia y para el pago de los alquileres, 
daños y costas hasta que se dicte sentencia definitiva, * * *. Se transmitiran 
por el juzgado de paz o municipal la fianza antes mencionada, asi como los otros 
papeles, a la escribania del Juzgado de Primera Instancia ante el cual se 
apelare."</p></blockquote>
<p>La fianza de suspension o <i>supersedeas bond</i> garantiza el pago de la 
renta adeudada o daños y costas hasta que termine definitivamente el asunto. 
Como una de las partes no se conformo con la decision del Juzgado de Primera 
Instancia sino que, por el contrario, interpuso apelacion, no podia terminar el 
asunto definitivamente en dicho juzgado. La fianza, pues, no debe responder 
solamente de las costas en el Juzgado de Primera Instancia sino hasta de las del 
tribunal en que terminara definitivamente el asunto en sentencia final.</p>
<p>El articulo 9 de la misma regla dispone que cuando el demandado apela de la 
sentencia del Juzgado de Primera Instancia, la ejecucion de la sentencia no sera 
suspendida a menos que el apelante pague al demandante o al juzgado de apelacion 
los alquileres que vayan venciendo. Este articulo no ordena la prestacion de 
otra <i>supersedeas bond</i> para suspender la sentencia como se exige en el 
Juzgado de Paz o Juzgado Municipal. Es porque ya existe una, la que se presta en 
alguno de dichos juzgados cuando se apela contra su decision.</p>
<p>En el caso presente se presto una <i>supersedeas bond</i> defectuosa: su 
texto no concuerda con los terminos del articulo 8 de la Regla 72; solamente 
responde por las rentas, daños y costas que pudiera dictar el Juzgado de Primera 
Instancia, cuando deba responder de las rentas, daños y costas hasta la 
terminacion final del asunto. El apelado podia haber impugnado la fianza y 
pedido que se prestase otra para subsanar el defecto de la ya prestada, y el 
Juzgado indudablemente hubiera accedido a la peticion. Era y es de justicia 
ordenar la prestacion de una fianza de acuerdo con los terminos de la Regla 72, 
articulo 8 en vez de ordenar la ejecucion de la sentencia. "El Juzgado de 
Primera Instancia tiene discrecion para ordenar su prestacion en lugar de 
ordenar la ejecucion de la sentencia." (Zamora <i>contra</i> Dinglasan e 
Hilario, 77 Phil., 46, 50.) En el asunto de Mejia <i>contra</i> Alimorong (4 
Jur., Fil., 582), se decidio que "una fianza de apelacion es suficiente cuando 
se ajusta sustancialmente a lo que manda la ley, aunque difiera en sus terminos, 
con tal de que su efecto legal sea el de asegurar al apelado todos los derechos 
que se propuso, garantir la ley, en cuya virtud se exige la fianza." En De 
Castro y Morales <i>contra</i> Juez de Paz de Bocaue (33 Jur. Fil, 638), este 
Tribunal dijo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Con vista de la doctrina enunciada en el asunto de Tirangbuaya contra Juez 
de Primera Instancia de Rizal (14 Jur. Fil., 629); Requepo contra Juez de 
Primera Instancia de Ilocos Sur, y Rosales (21 Jur. Fil., 79) es evidente que 
las recurrentes tienen derecho al recurso que solicitan y a que se anule y se 
deje sin efecto la sentencia en cuya virtud se sobreseyo la apelacion 
interpuesta por dichas recurrentes.</p>
<p>"En el asunto de Tirangbuaya <i>contra</i> Juez de Primera Instancia de Rizal 
(14 Jur. Fil., 629), declaramos expresamente que en casos de apelaciones contra 
sentencias recaidas en juicios sumarios en las cuales resulta que, de buena fe, 
y no con el proposito de retrasar el asunto, se presta 'una fianza, compromiso u 
otro documento cualquiera el cual 'garantiza el apelado cuando menos una 
proteccion parcial de sus derechos, tal fianza, obligacion u otro instrumento, 
una vez aprobado por el Juez de Paz, es suficiente para conferir jurisdiccion al 
Juez de Primera Instancia,' cuando menos al objeto de permitir que se enmienden 
los defectos que pudiera tener la fianza; y expusimos nuestra creencia de que la 
competencia asi adquirida por el Juzgado de Primera Instancia, abarcaria tambien 
al acto de permitir que se subsanase la omision de no haber hecho el deposito 
del dinero que se declara adeudado en concepto de alquileres o uso de la finca. 
Segun la doctrina sentada en aquel asunto, pudieramos haber fundado nuestra 
sentencia en el presente, en la razon de que el Juez recurrido tenia competencia 
para conceder a los apelantes un plazo razonable a fin de que subsanasen el no 
haber depositado el importe de la sentencia dictada por el Juez de Paz, 
constando que la fianza prestada se proponia claramente a responder de todos 
cuantos daños y perjuicios pudieran adjudicarse en apelacion."</p></blockquote>
<p>Que tenia el apelante intencion de garantizar el pago de todas las costas 
hasta la terminacion del asunto no hay duda alguna, pues solo respondia por P160 
por alquileres de abril y mayo y P25 por apelacion segun Regla 40, articulo 3: 
del importe de la fianza de P300 quedaba un remanente de P135, dos veces mas que 
la fianza de apelacion (P60), Regla 44, articulo 5.</p>
<p>La justicia sustancial es el ideal hacia el cual deben dirigirse todos los 
esfuerzos de los tribunales al interpretar y aplicar las disposiciones del 
Reglamento. (Regla 1, articulo 2.)</p>
<p>En su mocion de 2 de junio, el recurrido pide la ejecucion de la sentencia 
dictada en la Causa Civil No. 73144 del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila 
porque el recurrente no deposito los alquileres correspondientes a los meses de 
Febrero y siguientes. Este Tribunal no puede actuar sobre dicho asunto porque no 
esta elevado aun en grado de apelacion; precisamente el recurrente pide que se 
ordenase al Honorable Juez recurrido que apruebe el expediente de apelacion y 
que lo eleve a esta Superioridad. Una mocion pidiendo la disolucion del 
interdicto prohibitorio preliminar tal vez hubiera sido procedente; pero el 
apelante ha depositado ya la cantidad de P400 para los meses de febrero a junio, 
ademas de estar ya garantizado el pago de las rentas, daños y costas con la 
segunda <i>supersedeas bond</i> de P400 presentada en 9 de diciembre de 1946 sin 
contar con la fianza de P200 para responder de los daños y perjuicios que 
pudiera causar la expedicion de la orden de interdicto prohibitorio 
preliminar.</p>
<p>Procede revocarse la orden del Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Manila de 9 de 
diciembre de 1946 desaprobando el expediente de apelacion, la orden de 24 del 
mismo mes denegando la mocion de reconsideracion y la orden de 20 de enero de 
1947 ordenando la ejecucion de su sentencia y debe ordenarse al Honorable Juez 
recurrido que apruebe el expediente de apelacion y que lo eleve al Tribunal de 
Apelacion correspondiente.</p>
<p>Dictese sentencia a tenor de lo resuelto.</p><i>Moran, Pres., Perfecto,

<p>PARAS, <i>J.</i>:</p>I dissent because the defendant-petitioner 
knew that the decision against him had become final. He had even asked for the 
suspension of the execution of the judgement under the provisions of 
Commonwealth Act No. 689 as amended by Republic Act No. 66.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p>FERIA, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>This is a petition for <i>mandamus</i> to compel the respondent judge to 
approve the record on appeal filed by the petitioner in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, which refused to approve said record on the ground that no 
appeal bond was filed by the appellant for the perfection of an appeal from the 
Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Before proceeding it may not be amiss to note that in an action for 
<i>mandamus</i> to compel a respondent judge to allow or approve a record on 
appeal under section 15, Rule 41, the jurisdiction of this Court is limited to 
order the respondent judge to do the act complained or allow the record on 
appeal, if it is shown that the notice of appeal, appeal bond and record on 
appeal have been filed within the period fixed by law for the perfection of an 
appeal, and the respondent judge has refused to approve said record. No other 
question may properly be raised and decided in the action, and therefore the 
majority decision which revokes the order of the respondent judge denying the 
motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner and ordering the execution of 
the judgment on the ground that judgment has become final, is improper and 
unnecessary, because such revocation would be a necessary legal sequence of the 
approval of the record on appeal if ordered by this Court.</p>
<p>It is also to be observed that the filing of the so-called supersedeas bond 
for P400 on December 9, 1946, the same date on which the respondent judge 
disapproved the record on appeal, conditioned upon the payment of rents or 
damages and costs which may be awarded against the petitioner on appeal in the 
Supreme Court, can not be taken into consideration in the resolution of this 
case, because it does not appear that said bond was not even submitted on said 
or any other subsequent date for approval by the respondent judge as required by 
section 5, Rule 41, and it was attached to the record nine days after the 
expiration of the period for perfecting an appeal.</p>
<p>Going into the merits, we are sorry to dissent from the majority decision, 
inasmuch as from the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto it clearly 
appears that the petition for mandamus is without merit, because (1) the 
petitioner has not only lost but waived his right to appeal if he had still any, 
and therefore has no cause of action to compel the respondent judge to approve 
the record on appeal; and (2) the respondent judge has not failed to perform a 
duty enjoined by law but has, on the contrary, acted in accordance with law in 
disapproving the record on appeal.</p>
<p>(I) That the petitioner has not only lost his right to appeal as we shall 
show later, but has waived or abandoned it, is evident. Convinced that the bond 
he has filed in the municipal court to suspend the execution of the appealed 
judgment does not cover the appeal bond required by section 5, Rule 41, for the 
perfection of an appeal from the Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court, 
as shown by the clear and express terms of the said bond, the petitioner, after 
the court had ordered the execution of the judgment on December 9, 1946, filed 
on January 2, a petition for suspension of the execution of the judgment against 
him for a period of six months in accordance with section 4, of Commonwealth Act 
No. 689, as amended by Republic Act No. 66, which motion was set for hearing by 
the petitioner on January 11, 1947, and denied by the respondent judge on 
January 16, 1947.</p>
<p>The filing of said petition for suspension of execution of judgment 
constitutes a waiver or an abandonment on the part of the petitioner of his 
right to prosecute the appeal by <i>mandamus</i>, for the simple reason that, 
according to law, such petition may only be filed and passed upon by the court 
after the judgment has become final. An appeal will be considered as abandoned 
where appellant fails to present or prosecute it within the time prescribed by 
statute or rule of court, or <i>does an act</i> inconsistent with a prosecution 
of it (3 Cyc., 201). And that the attorney for the petitioner knew that it had 
that effect, is evidenced by the fact that on January 15 the petitioner filed 
<i>ex-parte</i> a motion to be allowed to withdraw his said petition, and now he 
asks this Court to annul the order of the respondent judge dated January 16, 
1947, denying his motion for withdrawal of said petition. His motion to withdraw 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">"MOTION TO WITHDRAW</p>
<p>"Comes now the undersigned on behalf of the defendant and to this Honorable 
Court respectfully shows:</p>
<p>"1. That the undersigned desired to have a ruling by the Supreme Court on the 
right of the defendant to appeal from the decision of this Court which was 
denied in the order of this Court dated December 24, 1946, by filing a petition 
for a writ of mandamus;</p>
<p>"2. That the undersigned reiterates his contention that inasmuch as there is 
a <i>subsisting</i> supersedeas bond which was filed in this Court when this 
case was appealed from the Municipal Court and that said supersedeas bond 
answers also for costs, and inasmuch as an <i>appeal bond</i> is required to 
answer for costs, and inasmuch also as it was held in a recent case decided by 
the Supreme Court that a supersedeas bond <i>filed before rendition of the 
decision of the Court of First Instance continues in effect when the defendant 
appeals to the Supreme Court</i>, the appeal in this case should have been 
allowed.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, the undersigned respectfully prays that he be allowed to withdraw 
his petition for the suspension of the execution of the judgment filed on 
January 2, 1947.</p>
<p>"Manila, January 15, 1947."</p></blockquote>
<p>The evident purpose of the petitioner in filing a motion to be allowed to 
withdraw his motion for suspension of the execution of the judgment, was to 
prosecute his appeal abandoned by such motion, in order that he can have, 
according to what he states in the same motion, a ruling of this Court on the 
sufficiency of the supersedeas bond filed in the municipal court for the 
perfection of an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance to the 
Supreme Court. But the respondent judge denied the petition for the suspension 
of the execution of judgment and, by necessary implication, the motion to 
withdraw said petition, on the ground that the court has "found in its decision 
dated October 10, 1946 that the premises in question are being used by the 
defendant to carry on his ice cream business and therefore not used solely for 
dwelling purpose," and consequently the petitioner was not entitled to such 
suspension granted only to tenants of residential premises.</p>
<p>(II) The respondent judge acted in conformity with the provision of sections 
3 and 13, Rule 41, in disallowing or dismissing the appeal on the ground that no 
appeal bond has been filed by the petitioner, because the supersedeas bond filed 
by the petitioner with, and approved by, the municipal court included only the 
appeal bond for the perfection of the appeal from the municipal court to the 
Court of First Instance, and not the appeal bond required by section 5, Rule 41, 
for the perfection of an appeal from the Court of First Instance to the Court of 
Appeals or the Supreme Court. The supersedeas bond Exhibit A-1 filed by the 
petitioner with the municipal court expressly stipulated that the principal 
(petitioner) and his surety Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. "bind 
themselves jointly and severally in favor of the plaintiff, that the defendant 
will diligently prosecute <i>his appeal to the Court of First Instance of 
Manila</i>, and he will pay whatever rents, damages and acts which may be 
awarded against him <i>on the appeal</i> or as a dismissal thereof not exceeding 
the amount of three hundred pesos (P300) Philippine currency."</p>
<p>The execution of the judgment ordered by the respondent judge on the ground 
that the judgment against the petitioner has become final, because no appeal 
bond has been filed, should not be confused with the execution of a judgment of 
the municipal judge during, and without prejudice to, the pendency of an appeal 
in the Court of First Instance because of failure on the part of the 
defendant-appellant to file a supersedeas bond to answer for the rents or 
damages awarded by the inferior court in its judgment, or to pay to the appellee 
or deposit with the court the rents or damages accruing during the pendency of 
the said appeal. The law governing the effect of failure to file said 
supersedeas bond and to pay or deposit said rents or damages has lately been 
construed liberally by this Court in order to carry out the intention of the 
Legislature in enacting Commonwealth Act No. 689, as amended by Republic Act No. 
66. But the law regulating the perfection of an appeal in forcible entry and 
illegal detainer as well as in all other cases, or the effect of failure to file 
on time an appeal bond on the right to appeal, has not been and can not be 
construed liberally in favor of the tenants, for the legislative intent in 
enacting Commonwealth Act No. 689 as amended by Republic Act No. 66 can not be 
extended thereto.</p>
<p>The ruling in the decision of this Court in the cases of Fernando <i>vs</i>. 
De la Cruz (61 Phil., 435), and Belmonte <i>vs</i>. Marin (76 Phil., 198), 
quoted in the majority decision, in which it was held that the supersedeas bond 
to pay rents, damages and costs, includes the appeal bond for perfecting an 
appeal <i>from the inferior court to the Court of First Instance</i> is not 
applicable to the present case, for the question now in issue is whether the 
supersedeas bond filed by the petitioner in the municipal court covers the 
appeal bond required for perfecting an appeal <i>from the Court of First 
Instance to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court</i>. And the ruling in the 
case of Zamora <i>vs</i>. Dinglasan (77 Phil., 46) does not also apply, because 
it referred to execution of the judgment of the inferior court during the 
pendency of the appeal to the Court of First Instance for failure to make on 
time the monthly deposit required by section 8, Rule 72, of the Rules of 
Court.</p>
<p>The majority decision is grounded upon two premises, to wit: (1) That the 
bond required in section 8, Rule 72, answers not only for costs in the Court of 
First Instance but also for those in the Supreme Court, because the bond is 
executed to "pay rents, damages and costs down to the time of final judgment in 
the action;" and (2) that the bond filed by the petitioner in the municipal 
court includes the appeal bond for appeal to the Supreme Court, and though 
defective it guarantees a partial protection of the right of the appellee to 
costs which may be awarded by the Supreme Court, and therefore it may be amended 
in accordance with the ruling of this Court in the cases cited in the 
decision.</p>
<p>(1) Section 8 in its pertinent part, and section 9, Rule 72, read as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If judgment is rendered against the defendant, execution shall issue 
immediately, unless an appeal has been perfected and the defendant to stay 
execution files a sufficient bond approved by the justice of the peace or 
municipal court and executed to the plaintiff to enter the action in the Court 
of First Instance, and to pay the rents, damages, and costs down to the time of 
the final judgment in the action, and unless, during the pendency of the appeal, 
he pays to the plaintiff or to the Court of First Instance the amount of rent 
due from time to time under the contract, if any, as found by the judgment of 
the justice of the peace or municipal court to exist, or, in the absence of a 
contract, he pays to the plaintiff or into the court, on or before the tenth day 
of each calendar month, the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the 
premises for the preceding month at the rate determined by the judgment. All 
moneys so paid to the Court of First Instance shall be deposited in the 
provincial treasury, or in the City of Manila in the Insular Treasury, and shall 
be held there until the final disposition of the appeal. * * * if the case is 
tried on its merits in the Court of First Instance, any money paid into court by 
the defendant for the purposes of stay of execution shall be disposed of in 
accordance with the provisions of the judgment of the Court of First Instance, * 
* *.</p>
<p>"SEC. 9. <i>Stay of execution on appeal to Court of Appeals or Supreme 
Court</i>.—Where defendant appeals from judgment of the Court of First Instance, 
execution of said judgment shall not be stayed unless the appellant pays either 
to the plaintiff or into the appellate court the same amounts referred to in the 
preceding section to be disposed of in the same manner as therein 
provided."</p></blockquote>
<p>The first premise is wrong, because it clearly appears from the above quoted 
provisions that the bond provided in section 8 includes only an appeal bond for 
perfecting an appeal to the Court of First Instance, and not an appeal bond 
required for an appeal from the Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeals 
or Supreme Court, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Because, according to the provisions of said section 8, if the 
defendant appeals and desires to stay the execution of the judgment, he must 
execute a sufficient bond "to the plaintiff <i>to enter the action in the Court 
of First Instance</i>, and to pay the rents, damages, and costs down to the time 
of the <i>final judgment in the action</i>," and to pay to the plaintiff or to 
the court the amount of rent due from time to time during the pendency of the 
appeal; all money so paid to the Court of First Instance shall be deposited in 
the provincial treasury or the Insular Treasury, and shall be held there until 
the <i>final disposition of the appeal</i>; and if the case is tried on its 
merit in the Court of First Instance, any money paid into the court by the 
defendant for the purpose of stay of execution shall be disposed of <i>in 
accordance with the provisions of the judgment in the Court of First 
Instance</i>. And from the above it clearly appears that the phrase "down to 
final judgment in the action," refers to the "final judgment in the action" 
entered in the Court of First Instance, or "final disposition of the appeal" in 
said court, "in accordance with the provisions of the judgment of the Court of 
First Instance"; for it is an elementary rule of statutory construction that 
particular words and phrases employed in a statute are not to be considered in 
themselves alone and construed as if isolated from the rest, but they are to be 
interpreted with reference to the language surrounding and accompanying them—to 
the whole context.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Because the subject matter of section 8, Rule 72, is the stay of 
execution of the judgment of the inferior court in case of defendant's appeal to 
the Court of First Instance, and that of section 9 is the suspension of 
execution of the judgment of the Court of First Instance on defendant's appeal 
to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court; and according to a 
well-established rule of statutory construction, the words of a statute should 
be construed with reference to the subject matter, and if they are susceptible 
to several meanings that one is to be adopted which best accords with the 
subject to which the statute relates. Therefore, as the subject matter of 
section 8 is appeal from the judgment of justice of the peace or municipal court 
and suspension of execution of the said judgment during the pendency of the 
appeal, the words "final judgment in the action" should be construed to mean 
final judgment in the action by the Court of First Instance on appeal, for such 
construction best accords with the subject to which said section 8, Rule 72, 
relates, and not final judgment in the proceeding in the Court of Appeals, or 
Supreme Court on appeal, to which said section 8 does not relate.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Because to construe that the bond under consideration includes the 
appeal bond from the Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeals or the 
Supreme Court would lead to great inconveniences and absurdities, and would make 
the appeal by the defendant burdensome if not prohibitive. Such a construction 
would lead to great inconveniences, for it is difficult if not impossible to fix 
the amount of the bond to be required from defendant-appellant, which according 
to the decision has to cover the rents or damages and costs which may be awarded 
to the plaintiff by the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court, since the total 
amount of monthly rents or damages which would accrue from time to time during 
the pendency of the appeal depends upon the length of time it would take for the 
Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court to dispose of 
the appeals. It would lead to absurdities for such a construction or theory 
assumes, without any basis, that the Court of First Instance will decide the 
appeal against the defendant-appellant, and besides that the defendant shall 
necessarily appeal from the adverse decision of the Court of First Instance. And 
it would make the appeal from the inferior court to the Court of First Instance 
more burdensome if not prohibitive, because the defendant-appellant would have 
to file a supersedeas bond to answer not only for said rents or damages that 
have already accrued, and costs which may be awarded by the Court of First 
Instance, but also for rents or damages which would accrue from time to time 
down to final judgment by the Supreme Court and costs which may be awarded by 
this Court; and the amount of the supersedeas bond may be such as to be in many 
cases beyond the limited means of the defendant-appellant.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Because section 2, Rule 40, relating to perfection of appeal from 
the inferior court to the Court of First Instance in all civil actions including 
forcible entry and illegal detainer, requires only the filing of an appeal bond 
of P30 or a cash bond of P25; and there is no reason why in case a 
defendant-appellant desires to appeal and stay the execution of the judgment of 
the inferior court in forcible entry and illegal detainer, he should be required 
to put up a bond which shall cover not only the appeal bond required for the 
perfection of an appeal to the Court of First Instance, but also the appeal bond 
of P60 required by sections 3 and 5 of Rule 41 for perfecting an appeal to the 
Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, irrespective of whether or not he would 
subsequently appeal to said courts.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) And, finally, because this Supreme Court in the case of 
Mitschiener <i>vs</i>. Barrios (76 Phil., 55), in construing the supersedeas 
bond required in section 8, Rule 72, held that said bond answers only for rents 
or the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises 
adjudicated by the inferior court in favor of the plaintiff, and not those which 
may accrue from time to time during the pendency of the appeal, and that the 
deposit made by the defendant with the court of the amount of rents or damages 
in arrears awarded by the municipal court to the plaintiff and of P25 as appeal 
bond (together with the notice of appeal and deposit of docket fees), was 
sufficient to perfect his appeal and to suspend the execution of the judgment of 
the municipal court. In view of said ruling in the decision in said case, penned 
by Mr. Justice Perfecto, and signed or concurred in by Mr. Justice Paras, Mr. 
Justice Briones, Mr. Justice Pablo, the undersigned and the then Justices 
Jaranilla and De Joya, and promulgated on February 1, 1946, the majority can not 
now hold, without reversing itself for no reason whatever, that the supersedeas 
bond under consideration answers for the costs which may be awarded by this 
Court, on the ground that under section 8, Rule 72, said bond is to pay the 
rents or damages which may be awarded by the court of last resort, and therefore 
also the costs therein.</p>
<p>(2) The second premise on which the decision is based is also wrong, because 
in the present case there is a complete failure on the part of the petitioner to 
file the appeal bond required for the perfection of appeal from the Court of 
First Instance to the Supreme Court. The bond for three hundred pesos (P300) 
filed by the petitioner expressly states that it covers only the costs in the 
Court of First Instance, and does not guarantee even a partial protection of the 
right of the appellee to the costs which may be awarded by the Supreme Court on 
appeal, and therefore it can not confer on the appellate court the power or 
jurisdiction to allow such defects in the bond to be amended. And it is an 
elementary rule in civil law that "The liability of a surety is not to be 
extended by implication beyond the terms of his contract. To the extent, and in 
the manner, and under the circumstances pointed out in his obligation, he is 
bound, and no further." (La Insular <i>vs</i>. Machuca, 39 Phil., 567; 
Government of the P. I. <i>vs</i>. Herrero, 38 Phil., 410.) Therefore, the 
decision of this Court in the cases of De Castro <i>vs</i>. Justice of the Peace 
of Bocaue based on the ruling laid down in the case of Requepo <i>vs</i>. Judge 
of First Instance of Ilocos Sur and Rosales (21 Phil., 77) and Tirangbuaya 
<i>vs</i>. Judge of First Instance of Rizal (14 Phil., 613), far from being in 
support thereof, are against the theory of the majority.</p>
<p>In the case of Requepo <i>vs</i>. Judge of First Instance of Ilocos Sur and 
Rosales, this Court held the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The defendant, in the justice of the peace court, did not comply or even 
attempt to comply with these express provisions of the statute. He presented, as 
we have said, in that court no bond or obligation whatever, neither did he offer 
to present any such obligation. He did not pay or deposit or offer to do so the 
damages and costs. He presented a bond only when directed to do so by the Court 
of First Instance, after the plaintiff had presented a motion asking that court 
to dismiss the appeal. He has not yet paid or deposited the damages and 
costs.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"In the case of Tiranbuaya <i>vs</i>. Judge of First Instance of Rizal (14 
Phil., 613), this court said:</p>
<p>" 'We have frequently held that the Legislature, under its general authority 
to regulate appellate procedure, may require appeal bonds of the appellant in 
both civil and criminal cases, and in our decisions we have on many occasions 
recognized and accepted the general principle that acts required by statute to 
perfect an appeal are jurisdictional, and must be complied with to vest the 
appellate court with power to entertain the appeal. Manifestly, therefore, 
neither the appellate nor the trial court, over the objection of appellee, can 
dispense with the statutory security or accept a security of a different 
character from that named in the statute, and it follows, as of course, that 
where no bond is given, the appeal must, upon motion of the appellee, be 
dismissed or stricken from the docket, unless it appears that the requirement 
has been waived by the appellee, as a technical step in appellate procedure 
purely for the appellee's benefit.</p>
<p>" 'So also when an instrument purporting to be an appeal bond is so fatally 
defective as to be absolutely void or is not such an instrument as is 
contemplated by the statute, the appellate court acquires no jurisdiction. 
(Macondray &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. Quintero et al., 6 Phil., 429.)</p>
<p>" 'But an appeal bond or undertaking is sufficient where it substantially 
complies with the statute, although it varies from its language, provided its 
legal effect is to secure to the appellee all the rights contemplated by the 
statute requiring the bond. (Mejia <i>vs</i>. Alimorong, 4 Phil., 572.)'</p>
<p>"Had the defendant Rosales presented the bond or undertaking to the justice 
of the peace and if such bond or undertaking had been defective, these defects 
could have been cured in the Court of First Instance, even over the objection of 
the plaintiff, provided that it had been made to appear to the Court of First 
Instance that the appeal was taken in good faith and not for delay; but where, 
as in the case under consideration, no attempt whatever was made to comply with 
the express provisions of the statute, the Court of First Instance acquired no 
jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action, except to dismiss the appeal 
if the appellee, in due time, requested the dismissal. We find no adjudicated 
case, either in this jurisdiction or in the United States, where the appellate 
court has been allowed to take and retain jurisdiction where no attempt was made 
in the justice of the peace court to comply with the statute."</p></blockquote>
<p>PADILLA, <i>J.</i>:</p>I concur in this opinion.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p>HILADO, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>I regret my inability to see eye to eye with the majority in the disposition 
of this case.</p>
<p>Petitioner himself says (Petition, par. 9; Annex C of same, par. 5) that the 
period within which he had to perfect his appeal from the judgment of the Court 
of First Instance to the Supreme Court expired on November 28, 1946. Rule 41, 
section 3, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 3. <i>How appeal is taken</i>.—Appeal may be taken by serving upon the 
adverse party and filing with the trial court within thirty days from notice of 
order or judgment, a notice of appeal, an <i>appeal bond</i>, and a record on 
appeal. * * *" (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 5 of the same Rule stipulates, among other things, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The appeal bond shall be in the amount of sixty pesos (P60) unless the court 
shall fix a different amount, or <i>unless a supersedeas bond</i> is filed. * * 
*" (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Sections 9 and 13 of the same Rule ordain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 9. <i>When appeal deemed perfected; effect thereof</i>.—Upon the filing 
of the notice of appeal and the approval of the appeal bond and the record on 
appeal, the appeal is deemed perfected and the trial court loses its 
jurisdiction over the case, except to issue orders for the protection and 
preservation of the rights of the parties which do not involve any matter 
litigated by the appeal, and to approve compromises offered by the parties prior 
to the transmittal of the record on appeal to the appellate court.</p>
<p>"SEC. 13. <i>Effect of failure to file notice, bond, or record on 
appeal</i>.—Where the notice of appeal, appeal bond, or record on appeal is 
filed <i>but not within the period of time herein provided</i>, the appeal shall 
be dismissed." (Italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Considering the provisions of the aforequoted sections of Rule 41 together, 
it seems apparent that the appeal must be perfected within 30 days from notice 
of the order or judgment appealed from (of course, discounting any interruption 
of said period pursuant to other pertinent provisions of the Rules), failing 
which the order or judgment automatically and by operation of law becomes final 
and inappealable, subject in proper cases to the equitable remedy afforded by 
Rule 38. As specifically provided in section 13, where the notice of appeal, 
appeal bond, or record on appeal is filed but not within the period prescribed, 
the appeal <i>shall</i> be dismissed. In the case where a supersedeas bond is 
filed, as contemplated in section 5, the appeal bond is naturally dispensed 
with. But when should that supersedeas bond be filed in cases like the present? 
I answer this question by saying that normally it will have been filed even 
before the commencement of the thirty-day period in forcible entry and detainer 
cases where such supersedeas bond is filed with the justice of the peace or 
municipal court, pursuant to section 8 of Rule 72, and in exceptional cases, it 
may be filed thereafter but in my opinion never <i>after the expiration</i> of 
the thirty-day period for perfecting the appeal under Rule 41. The reason is not 
far to seek. The right of appeal not being inherent but purely statutory (Layda 
<i>vs</i>. Legazpi, 39 Phil., 83, 85), and the Rules having prescribed, among 
other cases, a definite period and specified other conditions for perfecting 
such appeal from the Court of First Instance to the superior courts, compliance 
with such conditions within such period is jurisdictional under pain of the 
judgment becoming final (Layda <i>vs</i>. Legazpi, <i>supra</i>). Said period 
has been set because the definite determination of judicial controversies is a 
matter of public concern. It is against public policy to hold the rights and 
liabilities of the parties in suspense for any period beyond what the law and 
rules have considered justifiable (Dy Cay <i>vs</i>. Crossfield &amp; O'Brien, 
38 Phil., 521; Layda <i>vs</i>. Legazpi, 39 Phil., 83, 88). The time limit is 
fixed upon the last day of the period for perfecting an appeal. Upon the 
expiration of that day, the court rendering the order or judgment, as well as 
all other courts, the litigants, as well as other parties who may have to do 
presently or in future with the case determined,—all should be able to know 
whether the determination is final or still subject to change.</p>
<p>The following fundamental principles laid down in the Layda case, 
<i>supra</i>, are still good law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. * * * Jurisdiction of appellate courts is not conferred by consent of the 
parties. The right to appeal is statutory.</p>
<p>"2. * * * Judgments in ordinary civil actions become final and may be 
executed the moment the time for perfecting an appeal has elapsed. If the 
appellant allows that time to elapse, his right to appeal is lost. A failure to 
perfect the appeal, within the time prescribed, is jurisdictional and the 
certification of a bill of exceptions (now record on appeal) thereafter cannot 
restore the jurisdiction which is lost.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*</p>
<p>"5. * * * Public policy and sound practice demand that, at the risk of 
occasional errors, judgments of courts should become final at some definite date 
fixed by the law. The very object for which courts were constituted was to put 
an end to controversies * * *."</p></blockquote>
<p>In the specific case under consideration, the lower court, as well as all 
other parties concerned were confronted with the question of whether or not upon 
the expiration of the 28th day of November, 1946, the last of the thirty-day 
period, the judgment of said court became final, considering that petitioner on 
that same day filed his notice of appeal and submitted to the Court of First 
Instance of Manila his record on appeal <i>without</i> any appeal bond, nor a 
supersedeas bond for the appeal from the Court of First Instance to the Supreme 
Court. That question could not any longer be held in the air until the appellant 
saw fit to file a supersedeas bond for said appeal or announced his choice for 
not doing so, suspending in the meantime the answer to the all-important 
question of whether or not the litigation was over and the judgment could be 
relied and acted upon as the law of the case. In this case, that supersedeas 
bond was not filed until December 9, 1946 (Annex A-2 of petition), <i>eleven 
days</i> after the expiration of the thirty-day period.</p>
<p>But it is said in the majority decision that this supersedeas bond was 
unnecessary because a supersedeas bond (Annex A-1 of petition) for P300 had 
already been posted on June 15, 1946, in the municipal court when the case was 
still there and in course of being appealed to the Court of First Instance. 
However, one does not need to read this bond twice to see that it was given only 
for the purposes of the appeal to the Court of First Instance, as clearly 
appears from the following undertaking therein: "* * * that the defendant will 
diligently prosecute his appeal to the <i>Court of First Instance of Manila</i> 
and he will pay whatever rents, damages and costs which may be awarded against 
him on <i>the</i> appeal * * *", clearly meaning the appeal to the Court of 
First Instance antecedently mentioned in the same sentence. This undertaking 
makes it as clearly referring to the appeal from the municipal court to the 
Court of First Instance as the second supersedeas bond refers to the appeal from 
the Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court from the following undertaking 
therein: "* * * that the defendant will diligently prosecute his appeal to the 
Supreme Court of the Philippines * * *".</p>
<p>The filing of the second supersedeas bond is a conclusive proof that the 
first was intended as <i>exclusive</i> of the appeal from the Court of First 
Instance to the Supreme Court. Moreover, said first bond expressly stipulates 
that it was to secure the diligent prosecution of the appeal to the Court of 
First Instance of Manila and the payment of whatever rents, damages and costs 
which may be awarded against the appellant "on the appeal"; and suretyship and 
guaranty contracts being strictly construed (Gov't. of P. I. <i>vs</i>. Herrero, 
38 Phil., 410; La Insular <i>vs</i>. Machuca, 39 Phil., 567), said bond can not 
be interpreted so as to extend its obligation beyond the natural scope of its 
express terms. In Government of Philippine Islands <i>vs</i>. Herrero, 
<i>supra</i>, it was held that "Sureties are only chargeable according to the 
strict letter of the bond. The extent of their liability is to be measured by 
the terms of their contract." In La Insular <i>vs</i>. Machuca, <i>supra</i>, it 
was said that "The liability of a surety is not to be extended by implication 
beyond the terms of his contract. To the extent, and in the manner, and under 
the circumstances pointed out in his obligation, he is bound, and no 
further."</p>
<p>The rule of liberality established in Rule 1, section 2, is invoked. But the 
construction of the first supersedeas bond, as executed by the obligors, is 
different and distinct from the construction of the Rules of Court. However, 
even the cited rule, in establishing the general principle of liberality, 
expressly provides that such liberality should be aimed at assisting the parties 
in obtaining just, <i>speedy</i>, and inexpensive determination of their 
controversies. We have advisedly underscored the word "speedy", for to encourage 
or aid an appeal from a judgment through the perfection thereof <i>beyond</i> 
the airtight time limitation of Rule 41, section 3, would be going 
<i>against</i> the objective of speediness in the determination of judicial 
controversies. If the appellee could not have <i>shortened</i> the period within 
which the appeal should have been perfected as little as by <i>one</i> day, why 
should the appellant be permitted to <i>lengthen</i> it by <i>eleven</i> 
days?</p>
<p>The effect of the majority opinion is to return to a most unsatisfactory and 
confusing state of affairs existing before the promulgation of Rule 41, section 
3, the remedying of which, I take it, was the very object of said section. That 
was the condition of the law which was deplored by this Court itself in Layda 
<i>vs</i>. Legazpi, <i>supra</i>, from which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the decision in the case of Gomez Garcia <i>vs</i>. Hipolito (2 Phil., 
732), hundreds of motions have been made for the purpose of dismissing bills of 
exceptions. The court has been annoyed by such motions, due to the fact that the 
time for the presentation of bills of exceptions <i>has not been definitely 
fixed</i>.</p>
<p>"Since the pronouncement of numerous decisions upon the question when bills 
of exception should be presented, the Legislature adopted Act No. 2347 (sections 
26 and 27), which has made more certain that period. By virtue of section 26 of 
said Act, the losing party in a land registration case must present his bill of 
exceptions within thirty days, counting from the date on which he received a 
copy of the decision, unless that period is extended by order of the court 
before its expiration. (Roman Catholic Bishop of Tuguegarao <i>vs</i>. Director 
of Lands, 34 Phil., 623; Bermudez <i>vs</i>. Director of Lands, 36 Phil., 774; 
Estate of Cordoba and Zarate <i>vs</i>. Alabado, 34 Phil., 920.)</p>
<p>"From said thirty days there may be deducted the time which the court 
occupied in considering a motion for a new trial and until notice of the 
decision on said motion is received.</p>
<p>"Since the announcement of the rule in the two above-cited cases, <i>scarcely 
a motion has been presented for the dismissal of a bill of exceptions in a land 
registration case</i>. The question whether or not the bill of exceptions is 
presented within time in a land registration case, <i>now</i>, is simply <i>a 
matter of counting the days</i>. Uncertainty leads to confusion, annoyance and 
delay.</p>
<p>"A more difficult question is presented when we consider the exact period 
within which a bill of exceptions must be presented in <i>ordinary actions</i>. 
That period is not definitely fixed, in the terms of days, by any statute. In 
fact, <i>that period is about as uncertain and indefinite as it could possibly 
be made</i>." (Pp. 85-86; italics supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The provision of section 3, Rule 41, in fixing at thirty days from notice of 
order or judgment the period for appeal, did exactly in the way of fixing the 
period what section 26 of Act No. 2347 did for appeals in land registration 
cases, namely, to make the period "simply a matter of counting the days", as 
this Court remarked in the Layda case. And said provision of the Rules of Court 
afforded the most needed remedy to cure the vagueness and confusion then 
prevailing in the matter of the period for appeal in ordinary actions which, as 
this Court truly said in the said case, was "about as uncertain and indefinite 
as it could possibly be made." Now, by allowing the present petitioner, as 
appellant in the main case, virtually to lengthen by eleven days the period for 
perfecting his appeal, what could prevent a future appellant from lengthening 
the period by thirty days, or more? Are we going to base the resolution of this 
question upon the <i>varying</i> circumstances of each particular case, and say 
that the extension should only be "reasonable"? How could litigants and lower 
courts definitely and with certainty decide what would be and what would not be 
reasonable in those cases without again and constantly coming to this Court for 
final decision? This would jettison the salutary effects of the very rule which 
was promulgated to remedy the preexisting confusion and throw judicial 
proceedings again into the same chaos of uncertainty and doubt. It would surely 
usher in a repetition of the "confusion, annoyance and delay" which this Court 
so justly lamented in the Layda case.</p>
<p>One of the cases cited in support of the majority decision is that of 
Fernando <i>vs</i>. De la Cruz (61 Phil., 435), a case which was also cited in 
Belmonte <i>vs</i>. Marin (76 Phil., 198). But it will be seen that in the 
Fernando case, this Court in saying that the supersedeas bond to be given for 
the appeal to the Court of First Instance had rendered unnecessary a separate 
appeal bond expressly added: "provided it is filed within the time for taking 
the appeal" (p. 440 of report). If said case is to be, by analogy, an authority 
here where the appeal is from the Court of First Instance to the Supreme Court, 
it will be in support of my stand that the supersedeas bond to be given for the 
purposes of such appeal should be filed <i>within the time for taking the same 
appeal</i>.</p>
<p>Neither can I agree that the supersedeas bond filed in the municipal court 
was merely defective in so far as the securing of the costs in the Supreme Court 
is concerned. If the intention of the makers of said bond had been also to 
include said costs but the idea was only inaccurately or inartificially 
expressed in the instrument, then I would agree that it would have been only 
defective. But the supersedeas bond filed in the municipal court did not provide 
that it was to cover "rents, damages and costs, down to the final judgment in 
the case", as petitioner now contends in paragraph 9 of his petition. In other 
words, if the supersedeas bond is made and executed in terms materially 
different from those required in Rule 72, section 8, it can not legally produce 
the effects contemplated by said provision, for the obligation of the sureties 
is not what the Rule expects but what the obligors voluntarily undertake, their 
contract being a voluntary one.</p>
<p><i>Last but not least</i>: We must remember that this is a case of mandamus 
to compel approval of the record on appeal. To prosper it must come within the 
provisions of Rule 41, section 15. To be within the said section, the lower 
court must have erroneously disallowed the record on appeal—it must have 
disallowed what it was its ministerial duty to allow. Or otherwise expressed, 
the allowance of that record on appeal must have been "an act which the law 
specifically enjoins as a duty" of said court. But how could we say this when 
the appeal had not been perfected within the reglementary period of thirty days, 
because the supersedeas bond (Annex A-2), which would have been the substitute 
for the appeal bond, was filed eleven days thereafter.</p>
<p>The majority decision (p. 47, <i>ante</i>) contains this quotation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'El Juzgado de Primera Instancia tiene discrecion para ordenar su 
prestacion (of a bond) en lugar de ordenar la ejecucion de la sentencia' (Zamora 
<i>contra</i> Dinglasan e Hilario, 77 Phil., 46, 50)."</p></blockquote>
<p>If, applying the above doctrine to the case at bar, Judge Dinglasan had 
<i>discretion</i> to admit the belated supersedeas bond, and allow the record on 
appeal, instead of taking the course that he took, he necessarily had discretion 
to make his choice between the two courses of action, for discretion, by its 
very nature, does not operate <i>only in one direction</i> but in more than one. 
A one-way course of action would only imply a duty. Where the court has 
discretion, the manner of its exercise can not, of course, be controlled by 
mandamus, although the exercise itself can be thus compelled.</p>
<p>I vote to deny the petition.</p>
