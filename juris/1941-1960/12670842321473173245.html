				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; commenced In the&nbsp; justice&nbsp; of the peace court&nbsp; of Hermosa,&nbsp; Bataan,&nbsp; an action&nbsp; of forcible entry and detainer against&nbsp; the defendants,&nbsp; covering a parcel of&nbsp; land situated in the barrio&nbsp; of Saba, Municipality of Hermosa, Province of Bataan. After&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the justice of&nbsp; the peace&nbsp; court rendered a decision&nbsp; dated May&nbsp; 11, 1940, in favor of the plaintiffs, from&nbsp; which the defendants appealed to the Court of First Instance of Bataan which after the trial, rendered a decision dated October 8,&nbsp; 1941, sentencing&nbsp; the defendants to vacate the land in&nbsp; question and deliver the same&nbsp; to the plaintiffs and to pay jointly and severally to the latter the sum of P455, plus the costs. On&nbsp; December 2, 1941,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a record on appeal with&nbsp; notice of&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; stating&nbsp; that,&nbsp; being&nbsp; poor litigants, they might not&nbsp; file the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; bond&nbsp; in&nbsp; pursuance of&nbsp; section 22&nbsp; of Rule 3&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Rules&nbsp; of Court whereupon&nbsp; the clerk&nbsp; of court served a notice upon&nbsp; the parties that said record&nbsp; on appeal would be heard&nbsp; for approval&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1941.&nbsp; On December 5, 1941 the court, acting upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion filed by the plaintiffs on November 19, 1941,&nbsp; ordered the issuance of a writ of execution Nothing appears to have subsequently been done&nbsp; in the case until April 23, 1947 when the plaintiffs filed a petition for the reconstitution of the records, which was granted by the court in its order of&nbsp; June 16,&nbsp; 1947, allowing said reconstitution by copies filed by the plaintiffs and&nbsp; attached to&nbsp; the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; On July&nbsp; 5, 1952,&nbsp; the plaintiffs&nbsp; filed a petition praying that the appeal interposed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the defendants be dismissed for lack of&nbsp; prosecution and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the judgment be&nbsp; ordered executed.&nbsp; On August 4, 1952,&nbsp; the court issued&nbsp; an&nbsp; order requiring&nbsp; attorney for&nbsp; the plaintiffs to&nbsp; notify the defendants of&nbsp; the hearing&nbsp; of said&nbsp; motion. On&nbsp; September&nbsp; 30, 1952,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; issued an order&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal taken&nbsp; by the defendants and ordering the execution of the&nbsp; judgment dated October 8, 1941.&nbsp; On January 30, 1953,&nbsp; Atty. Eliseo M. Tensa, in representation&nbsp; of the defendants, filed a&nbsp; petition praying that&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of September 30,&nbsp; 1952, be reconsidered&nbsp; and the&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; execution immediately lifted and that the defendants, through their new counsel, be heard&nbsp; in connection with their&nbsp; appeal.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the&nbsp; opposition filed by the&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; on March&nbsp; 2, 1953,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; issued&nbsp; an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated March&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1953, setting aside the order of September 30, 1952, and&nbsp; allowing the defendants to perfect their appeal within the reglemenary period.&nbsp; On&nbsp; March 30,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; the defendants filed a motion for&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial&nbsp; under Act No. 3110, alleging that the appeal could&nbsp; not be&nbsp; prosecuted because the transcript was not available.&nbsp; On October 30,&nbsp; 1953, the court&nbsp; issued an order denying the motion for reconsideration of March 30, 1953 filed by the plaintiffs, and granting motion&nbsp; for new trial filed by the defendants.&nbsp; From&nbsp; this order&nbsp; the present appeal was taken by the plaintiffs.<p>The appellants&nbsp; contend&nbsp; that the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; should have&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">motu&nbsp; propio</span> dismissed&nbsp; the appeal&nbsp; taken by&nbsp; the defendants for having failed to take any steps to perfect it during more than 11 years; that the petition filed on January 30, 1953,&nbsp; by Atty. Tensa&nbsp; was not accompanied by affidavits of merits; that the appeal&nbsp; interposed by the defendants should&nbsp; at any rate have&nbsp; been dismissed for their failure to file an appeal bond;&nbsp; and that the lower court should not have ordered a&nbsp; new&nbsp; trial especially because&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; institute&nbsp; reconstitution proceedings within the period of one year fixed in Republic Act No. 441.</p><p>These contentions are untenable.&nbsp; The lower court could not of course dismiss the appeal taken by&nbsp; the defendants from the decision of October 8, 1941, without&nbsp; in the first&nbsp; place the records&nbsp; having been&nbsp; duly reconstituted. After the reconstitution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; records in pursuance of the&nbsp; order of June 16, 1947, it was not at all clear&nbsp; that the&nbsp; defendants had not&nbsp; taken&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary steps to perfect their appeal.&nbsp; Upon the other hand,&nbsp; it appears that the hearing for the approval of the record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal was set for December 10, 1941, and this was not&nbsp; held due to the outbreak&nbsp; of the last war.&nbsp;&nbsp; The alleged&nbsp; failure of the defendants to file an appeal bond cannot be invoked against&nbsp; them&nbsp; since&nbsp; the&nbsp; record&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; show that the court had ruled on the notice of&nbsp; appeal, stating that they could not file&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; bond for being paupers; and much less&nbsp; is&nbsp; there&nbsp; any&nbsp; indication in the&nbsp; reconstituted records that&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants in&nbsp; fact failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; file an appeal bond.</p><p>That&nbsp; the petition filed by&nbsp; the new counsel for&nbsp; the defendants&nbsp; on January 30, 1953,&nbsp; was not accompanied by affidavits of merits is of no moment,&nbsp; since it was granted on&nbsp; the&nbsp; premise that the plaintiffs had failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply with&nbsp; the order requiring them&nbsp; to send&nbsp; notice of their ex parte motion&nbsp; of July 5,&nbsp; 1952 to the defendants, and this was a&nbsp; matter&nbsp; that could be&nbsp; seen&nbsp; from the&nbsp; records under the control of the court.</p><p>In&nbsp; view of&nbsp; the loss&nbsp; or destruction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; transcript, it necessarily follows that the defendants could not have prosecuted their&nbsp; appeal in the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals, even if duly perfected.</p><p>That no reconstitution proceedings&nbsp; were initiated by the defendants is not a ground for the dismissal of their appeal, since the remedy of reconstitution was&nbsp; also available to the plaintiffs who, in view&nbsp; of the judgment in their&nbsp; favor,&nbsp; were more called upon to reconstitute, as they did, the records.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one&nbsp; year period fixed in Republic Act No. 441 cannot be invoked against the defendants,&nbsp; since the latter were not the ones who sought the reconstitution of this case.</p><p>Wherefore, the appealed order is affirmed with costs against the appellants.</p><p><em>Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</em> and<em> Felix, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
