				<BR><BR><div align="justify">About 11 o'clock in the evening of March 7, 1947, in the barrio of Amistad, 
municipality of Angadanan, Isabela, various individuals armed with rifles and 
revolvers broke into the house of the spouses Victoriano Vallejo and Primitiva 
Pagaduan. At that time the spouses and their six children were sleeping in the 
bedroom, and. four other persons including Braulio Simon, granduncle of 
Primitiva Pagaduan, were sleeping in the <em>sala</em>. Both the bedroom and the 
<em>sala</em> were lighted by a kerosene lamp. The spouses, who got up startled 
by the intrusion, were ordered by the intruders to lie on the floor face down 
and then asked for their money. They told the robbers to look for it in the 
trunk (<em>baul</em>) located in the bedroom. The robbers ransacked the trunk 
and took P900 in cash, jewelry consisting of watches, rings, necklace, and 
earrings, and two blankets. The total value of the loot, including the cash, was 
P1,460.
<p>Not content with the robbery, one of the robbers dragged Primitiva Pagaduan, 
31s downstairs and handed her to two other robbers, who took her to a rice field 
about 100 meters north of the house, where three of the robbers raped her one 
after another. The last one to rape her was the same robber who had dragged her 
down from the bedroom, and he warned her that should she reveal their identity 
she and all the members of her family would be killed. While the last rapist was 
performing the bestial act, Primitiva Pagaduan heard a gunshot somewhere near 
the house. The robbers fled immediately afterwards. Primitiva found her husband 
dead about 17 meters south of the stairway of the house. He had been shot thru 
the head.</p>
<p>The crime was reported that same night to the nearest authority, the barrio 
lieutenant named Severiano Kasing, who lived about 400 meters from the scene of 
the crime and who early the following morning went there to investigate. 
Primitiva Pagaduan did not reveal to him the identity of the malefactors but 
told him that she did not recognize them. However, she asked the barrio 
lieutenant to send for the chief of police of Angadanan. when the latter came in 
the afternoon of March 8, Primitiva confided to him that she recognized six of 
the robbers who entered her room and who, according to her, were Leonilo Ganal, 
Arcadio Ramos, Casimiro Clemente, Venancio Nolasco, Mauro Nolasco, and Venancio 
Lagrmay. She did not reveal to the chief of the police, Antonio Melad, that she 
had been raped because, she said, she was ashamed.</p>
<p>By order of the chief of police the body of Victoriano Vallejo was taken to 
the municipal building of Angadanan, where it was examined and embalmed by Dr. 
Eligio A. Montero. The following day, March 9, the family took the corpse to 
Tayug, Pangasinan, for burial.</p>
<p>A complaint for robbery in band with homicide was filed by the chief of 
police in the justice of the peace court of Angadanan on March 17, 1947, against 
the six persons named by Primitiva Pagaduan.</p>
<p>On March 16, 1947, since the robbers who were known to Primitiva Pagaduan and 
some of whom were residents of the same barrio of Amistad had not been arrested, 
Primitiva went to the town of Gamu, Isabela, and there reported to Lt. Artemio 
P. Bahia of the Constabulary that she could not return to her home in Amistad 
because Leonilo Ganal and his companions were still at large. Lieutenant Bahia 
accompanied Primitiva Pagaduan the following day to the barrio of Amistad, where 
he continued the investigation. She revealed to Lieutenant Bahia the same names 
of the six persons whom she said she recognized as the robbers. Upon being 
questioned by him as to what the robbers did to her after being dragged to the 
rice field, she revealed that she was raped by them one after another. On March 
21 Lieutenant Bahia filed an amended complaint accusing the six persons above 
named of robbery in band with homicide and rape. Of the six accused, only 
Leonilo Ganal, Arcadio Ramos, and Casimiro Clemente were apprehended, the other 
three—Mauro Nolasco, Venancio Nolasco, and Venancio Lagmay—having escaped and 
not having been arrested up to the time of the trial of this case.</p>
<p>The trial court found the said three accused guilty of robbery in band with 
homicide and rape and sentenced each of them to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and 
to indemnify Primitiva Pagaduan in the amount of P1,460, the value of the 
articles and money stolen by the accused.</p>
<p>The appellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to prove their 
guilt.</p>
<p>The witnesses who testified as to the identity of the robbers were Primitiva 
Pagaduan, her granduncle Braulio Simon, and her 11-year-old daughter Eufegenia 
Vallejo. Primitiva Pagaduan swore that she was able to recognize six of the 
robbers, namely, Leonilo Ganal, Arcadio Ramos, Casimiro Clemente, Venancio 
Nolasco, Mauro Nolasco, and Venancio Lagmay. Braulio Simon said that he was able 
to recognize only two of the robbers, namely, Mauro Nolasco and the cross-eyed 
man, pointing to the accused Arcadio Ramos. And Eufegenia Vallejo said that she 
recognized only Mauro Nolasco and Venancio Nolasco, both of whom were still at 
large.</p>
<p>We shall examine the proofs as to the identity of each of the three 
appellants.</p>
<ol><li><em>Leonilo Ganal</em>.—This appellant was well known to Primitiva Pagaduan 
because he resided in the barrio of Amistad, he being married to a niece of the 
barrio lieutenant, Severiano Kasing, and because in 1946-1947 he cultivated as 
tenant a parcel of land belonging to the spouses Victoriano Vallejo and 
Primitiva Pagaduan. As a matter of fact he admitted having been to the house of 
said spouses several times before the crime in question was committed. Primitiva 
Pagaduan identified him as one of the six robbers who entered her bedroom on the 
night in question and as the one who dragged her downstairs and later raped her 
and warned her not to reveal his and his companions' identity on pain of death. 
She said that she did not recognize the two other robbers who raped her because 
each of them covered her face with his hat while raping her. Leonilo Ganal 
admitted during the trial that there was no enmity between him and Primitiva 
Pagaduan and that he knew of no reason or motive why she should testify falsely 
against him. </li></ol>
<p>The fact that Primitiva Pagaduan did not reveal to barrio lieutenant 
Severiano Kasing the identity of any of the robbers including Leonilo Ganal was 
satisfactorily explained by her during the trial by saying that she feared that 
Leonilo Ganal and his companions might kill her and the members of her family if 
she then and there revealed their identity. Besides, she did not feel free to 
denounce Leonilo Ganal to Severiano Kasing in view of the latter's relation of 
affinity to the former.</p>
<p>A perusal of the testimony of Primitiva Pagaduan convinces us of her 
sincerity and veracity. Besides, if she had no regard for the truth and intended 
to make a false accusation, she could have induced her 11-year-old daughter 
Eufegenia Vallejo and her granduncle Braulio Simon to corroborate her testimony 
that Leonilo Ganal was one of the robbers.</p>
<p>Although Frimitiva Pagaduan's testimony as to the identity of Leonilo Ganal 
is uncorroborated, we believe with the trial court that it is sufficient. She 
had ample opportunity to recognize Leonilo Ganal unmistakably. Leonilo Ganal was 
well known to her. She knew his voice. There was light in the bedroom which 
Leonilo Ganal and his companions entered to rob, and it was a moonlit night. It 
was Leonilo Ganal who dragged her downstairs, followed his two unrecognized 
companions in raping her, and then warned her not to reveal their identity on 
pain of death.</p>
<p>We think the trial court did not err in not believing Leonilo Ganal's alibi. 
He said that on March 7, 1947, he was in the barrio of Magrumbuan, Cauayan, 
Isabela, threshing palay from 7 o'clock in the morning up to midnight. It is 
certainly unusual for rice threshers to work continuously from early morning to 
midnight. He also said that he transferred to that barrio to live with his 
mother on March 6, 1947, the day before the crime in question was committed. 
Nevertheless he was arrested in the barrio of Amistad while he was playing 
blackjack in the house of one Alberto de Jesus. He testified on 
cross-examination that in May, 1946, he talked to Primitive Pagaduan regarding 
his tilling of her land.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Q. And you talked to her <em>in her house</em>, is not that a fact?— </p>
<p>A. <em>Yes, sir</em>.</p>
<p>"Q. You are familiar in /with/ the house because you have been there for many 
days. Is it not?—</p>
<p>A. <em>Yes sir</em>.</p>
<p>"Q. You know that house has one room and also has one sala. Is it not?—</p>
<p>A. I never went up the house of Primitiva Pagaduan, I only reached the yard 
of the house." (Pages 365-366, t.s.n.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The last answer contradicts the previous answers and to our mind evinces 
prevarication. Why should he lie about knowing that the house of the victim has 
one room and one <em>sala? </em>He was evidently afraid to admit the truth lest 
he exposed his guilt.</p>
<p>We are convinced by the evidence of this appellant's guilt.</p>
<ol start="2"><li><em>Arcadio Ramos, alias Dominador Ramos</em>.—This appellant is also well 
known to Primitiva Pagaduan because he is married to the sister of the wife of 
an uncle of hers named Mariano Simon. He was positively identified by Primitiva 
Pagaduan as one of the robbers who entered her bedroom on the night in question. 
Braulio Simon, the granduncle of Primitiva Pagaduan who was her visitor on the 
night in question and who slept in the sala, also identified Arcadio Ramos as 
the one who pointed a revolver at him while Mauro Nolasco held him down by the 
neck. Although at that time Braulio Simon did not know Arcadio Ramos' name, he 
said he recognized him by face and that he is cross-eyed. No reason is suggested 
by this appellant why Primitive. Pagariuan and Braulio Simon should testify 
falsely against him. </li></ol>
<p>The testimony of this appellant in his defense is patently unbelievable. He 
said that he did not know Victoriano Vallejo and had not even heard of his name 
before March 7, 1947. He also said that he did not know Primitiva Pagaduan. He 
even denied having heard the news of the killing of Primitiva Pagaduan's 
husband, when he was arrested by the constabulary on March 20, 1947, he gave his 
name as Dominador Ramos and not Arcadio Ramos, and during the trial he insisted 
that his name was Dominador Ramos, although at the beginning when he was asked 
to state his name and other personal circumstances he replied: "Arcadio Ramos, 
42 years of age, carried, farmer, residing in the barrio of Pinoma, Gauayan, 
Isabela." He admitted on cross-examination that when the interpreter called the 
name of Arcadio Ramos he responded to that name, and that when Braulio Simon 
pointed to him the interpreter asked his name and he answered, "Arcadio Ramos." 
He testified that on March 7, 1947, he did not leave his house because he was 
taking care of his wife, who was then complaining of headache.</p>
<p>In view of the apparent insincerity of the testimony of this appellant, on 
the one hand, and of his positive identification by the witnesses Primitiva 
Pagaduan and Braulio Simon as one of the robbers, on the other, we believe the 
trial court did not err in finding him guilty.</p>
<ol start="3"><li><em>Casimiro Clemente</em>.—This appellant was identified by Prirnitiva 
Pagaduan as one of the six robbers who entered her bedroom on the night in 
question. Her testimony, however, as to this appellant is debilitated by that of 
Eduardo A. Abesamis, justice of the peace of Angadanan, who testified that on 
Sunday, March 9, 1947, he met Primitiva Pagaduan in Echague. Isabels, on her way 
to Tayug, Pangasinan. to bury her deceased husband, and that he then and there 
took the opportunity to ask her how her husband was killed, and that she told 
him that he was killed by robbers; "that there were six of them and among those 
six she said she recognised four of them"; that Casimiro Clemente was not 
mentioned by Primitiva Pagaduan as one of the robbers; that she mentioned 
Leonilo Canal, Arcadio Ramos, and the two Nolascos; that she also did not 
mention the name of Venancio Lagmay (one of those still at large). </li></ol>
<p>In view of the fact that when Primitiva Pagaduan was called as a witness in 
rebuttal she was not asked to comment on tho testimony of Justice of the Peace 
Abesamis, that, testimony remains uncontradicted. Hence triers is no explanation 
from her as to why she failed to mention to the justice of the peace the name of 
Casimiro Clemente as one of the robbers. There is a possibility that she was not 
very positive as to this appellant's identity. Her testimony on this point being 
uncorroborated, and having been weakened by that of the justice of the peace, we 
entertain doubt as to the sufficiency of the proof of this appellant's identity. 
Such doubt must necessarily be resolved in favor of the accused, it being 
preferable to acquit a guilty person rather than convict an innocent one. </p>
<p>It results from the foregoing that the appellants Leonilo Ganal and Arcadio 
Ramos are guilty, while the appellant Casimiro Glernente is entitled to an 
acquittal on reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>The crime committed is robbery with homicide and rape. Robbery with homicide 
is punished by paragraph 1 of article 294 of the Revised, Penal Code with 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death. The fact that the crime was committed by a 
band and was accompanied by rape must be considered as aggravating 
circumstances. Under the second paragraph of article 296, any member of s. band 
who is present in the commission of a robbery by the band shall be punished as 
principal of any of the assaults committed by the band, unless it be shown that 
he attempted to prevent it. The appellants Ganal and Ramos must therefore be 
punished as principals of the crime of robbery with homicide. The penalty should 
be imposed in the maximum degree, but in view of the lack of sufficient votes to 
impose the death penalty, we are constrained to affirm the penalty of life 
imprisonment imposed by the trial court. The trial court, however, erred, in not 
sentencing the appellants to pay indemnities for the killing of Victoriano 
Vallejo and the rape of his wife.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the sentence of the trial court is modified as follows: Leonilo 
Ganal and Arcadio Ramos, <em>alias</em> Dominador Ramos, shall suffer 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em>, shall jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of 
the deceased victoriano Vallejo in the sum of P6,000 for the homicide and 
Primitiva Pagaduan in the sura of P4,000 for the rape, plus the sum of P1,460 as 
the value of the stolen articles, and shall each pay one third of the costs.</p>
<p>The appellant Casimiro Clemente is acquitted on reasonable doubt, with one 
third of the costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p>
<p><em>Moran, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor</em>, and 
<em>Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur. </p></div>
