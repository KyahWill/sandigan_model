				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The&nbsp; petitioner-appellant, an&nbsp; association&nbsp; of registered massagists&nbsp; and licensed&nbsp; operators&nbsp; of massage&nbsp; clinics in the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Manila and other parts of the country, filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila for declaratory&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; regarding the validity of Municipal Ordinance No.&nbsp; 3659, promulgated by the Municipal Board and approved&nbsp; by the City Mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp; To stop the City from enforcing said ordinance,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; secured an&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; upon&nbsp; filing of a bond in the sum of P1,000.00. A hearing was held, but&nbsp; the parties without introducing any evidence submitted the case for decision on the pleadings, although they submitted written memoranda.&nbsp;&nbsp; There after,&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; dismissed&nbsp; the petition and&nbsp; later dissolved the&nbsp; writ of injunction previously issued.<br><br>The petitioner appealed said&nbsp; order of dismissal directly to this Court.&nbsp; In support of its appeal, petitioner-appellant contends&nbsp; among&nbsp; other things that&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court erred in holding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Ordinance in question&nbsp; has not restricted the practice&nbsp; of massotherapy in massage clinics to hygienic and aesthetic massage, that the&nbsp; Ordinance is valid as it does not regulate the practice of massage, that the Municipal Board of Manila has the power to enact the Ordinance in question&nbsp; by virtue of Section 18, Subsection (<i>kk</i>), Republic&nbsp; Act 409, and that the permit fee of P100.00 is moderate&nbsp; and not unreasonable.&nbsp; Inasmuch as the appellant assails&nbsp; and discusses certain provisions regarding the ordinance in question, and it is necessary to pass upon the&nbsp; same, for&nbsp; purposes of&nbsp; ready&nbsp; reference, we are&nbsp; reproducing said&nbsp; ordinance <i>in&nbsp; toto.</i><br><blockquote><center> ORDINANCE NO. 3659 <br><br></center>AN ORDINANCE REGULATING THE OPERATION&nbsp;

Ordinance shall&nbsp; take&nbsp; effect upon&nbsp; its approval.<br><br>Enacted, August 27, 1954.<br><br>Approved, September 7, 1954,</blockquote>The main contention&nbsp; of the appellant in its appeal and the principal&nbsp; ground of its petition for declaratory judgment is&nbsp; that the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; is&nbsp; without&nbsp;&nbsp; authority to&nbsp; regulate the operation of massagists and the&nbsp; operation. of&nbsp; massage&nbsp; clinics&nbsp; within&nbsp; its jurisdiction;&nbsp; that&nbsp; whereas under the Old City Charter,&nbsp; particularly, Section 2444&nbsp; (<i>e</i>) of&nbsp; the Revised Administrative Code, the Municipal Board was expressly granted the power to regulate and fix the license&nbsp; fee&nbsp; for&nbsp; the occupation&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; massagists,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the New Charter of Manila, Republic Act 409, said power has been withdrawn or&nbsp; omitted and that now&nbsp; the Director of Health, pursuant&nbsp; to authority conferred&nbsp; by Section 938 of the Revised Administrative Code and Executive Order No.&nbsp; 317, series of 1941,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended by Executive Order No.&nbsp; 392, series, 1951, is the&nbsp; one who exercises supervision over the&nbsp; practice&nbsp; of&nbsp; massage and&nbsp; over massage clinics in the Philippines; that the&nbsp; Director of Health has issued Administrative Order No. 10, dated May 5, 1953, prescribing&nbsp; "rules and regulations governing the examination for admission&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; practice of massage,&nbsp; and the operation of massage clinics, offices, or establishments in&nbsp; the Philippines", which order was approved&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of Health and duly&nbsp; published&nbsp; in the Official&nbsp; Gazette;&nbsp; that Section 1&nbsp; (<i>a</i>) of Ordinance No.&nbsp; 3659&nbsp; has&nbsp; restricted&nbsp; the practice of massage to only hygienic and aesthetic massage prohibits or does not allow qualified massagists&nbsp; to practise therapeutic massage in&nbsp; their massage clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant also contends that the license fee of P100.00 for operator in Section 2&nbsp; of the Ordinance is&nbsp; unreasonable, nay,&nbsp; unconscionable.<br><br>If we can ascertain the intention of the Manila Municipal Board in promulgating the Ordinance in question, much of the&nbsp; objection&nbsp; of appellant to&nbsp; its&nbsp; legality may be solved. It would appear to us that&nbsp; the purpose&nbsp; of the Ordinance is not to&nbsp; regulate&nbsp; the practice of massage, much less&nbsp; to restrict the practice of&nbsp; licensed and&nbsp; qualified&nbsp; massagists of therapeutic massage in the Philippines. The&nbsp; end sought to be attained in the Ordinance is&nbsp; to prevent the commission of immorality and the&nbsp; practice of&nbsp; prostitution in an establishment masquerading&nbsp; as a massage clinic where the operators thereof&nbsp; offer to massage or manipulate superficial parts of the bodies of customers&nbsp; for hygienic and aesthetic purposes.&nbsp; This intention can readily be understood by the&nbsp; building requirements in Section 3 of the Ordinance, requiring that there be separate rooms for male and&nbsp; female customers; that&nbsp; instead of said&nbsp; rooms being separated by&nbsp; permanent partitions&nbsp; and swinging doors, there should only be sliding curtains&nbsp; between them; that there should be "no private&nbsp; rooms or separated compartments, except those assigned&nbsp; for toilet, lavatories, dressing room, office or kitchen"; that every massage clinic should be provided with&nbsp; only one entrance and shall have no direct&nbsp; or&nbsp; indirect communication whatsoever with any dwelling place,&nbsp; house or&nbsp; building-; and&nbsp; that no operator, massagist, attendant or helper will be allowed "to use or allow the use of a massage clinic as a place of assignation or permit&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission therein&nbsp; of&nbsp; any immoral or indecent act", and in fixing the operating hours&nbsp; of such clinic between 8:00 a.m.&nbsp; and 11:00&nbsp; p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; This intention of the Ordinance was correctly ascertained by Judge Hermogenes Concepcion, presiding&nbsp; in the trial court, in his order of dismissal where he said:&nbsp; "What the Ordinance tries to avoid is that the massage clinic run by an operator who may not be a masseur or massagista may be&nbsp; used as cover for the running or <i> maintaining</i> a house of prostitution."<br><br>Ordinance No. 3659, particularly, Sections 1 to 4, should be considered as&nbsp; limited to massage clinics used&nbsp; in the practice of hygienic and aesthetic massage.&nbsp; We&nbsp; do not believe&nbsp; that the Municipal Board of the&nbsp; City of&nbsp; Manila and the Mayor wanted or intended to regulate the practice of massage in general or restrict the&nbsp; same to hygienic and aesthetic only.<br><br>As to the&nbsp; authority of&nbsp; the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Board to enact the Ordinance&nbsp; in question, the City Fiscal,&nbsp; in representation of the appellees, calls our&nbsp; attention&nbsp; to&nbsp; Section 18&nbsp; oi the New Charter of the City of Manila, Republic Act No. 409, which, gives legislative powers to the Municipal Board to enact all ordinances it may deem necessary and proper for the promotion of the morality, peace, good order, comfort, convenience and general&nbsp; welfare&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City and&nbsp; its inhabitants.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is generally referred to&nbsp; as the General Welfare Clause, a delegation in&nbsp; statutory form&nbsp; of the police power,&nbsp; under which&nbsp; municipal corporations&nbsp; are authorized to&nbsp; enact ordinances to provide for the&nbsp; health and safety,&nbsp; and promote the morality,&nbsp; peace and general welfare of its inhabitants. We agree with&nbsp; the City Fiscal.<br><br>As regards&nbsp; the permit fee&nbsp; of&nbsp; P100.00,&nbsp; it will be&nbsp; seen that said fee is made payable not by the masseur or massagist, but by&nbsp; the operator of a massage clinic&nbsp; who&nbsp; may not&nbsp; be a massagist&nbsp; himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared&nbsp; to&nbsp; permit&nbsp; fees required&nbsp; in other operations,&nbsp; P100.00 may appear to be too large and&nbsp; rather unreasonable.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; much discretion is given to&nbsp; municipal corporations in&nbsp; determining the&nbsp; amount of said fee without&nbsp; considering' it as a' tax for revenue purposes:<br><blockquote>"The amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fee or charge is&nbsp; properly&nbsp; considered&nbsp; in determining whether it is a. tax or an&nbsp; exercise of the police power. The&nbsp; amount may be so&nbsp; large as to itself&nbsp; show that the purpose was to raise revenue&nbsp; and not to regulate, but in regard&nbsp; to this matter there is&nbsp; a marked&nbsp; distinction between license fees imposed upon useful and&nbsp; beneficial occupations which the sovereign wishes to regelate but&nbsp;&nbsp; not restrict,&nbsp; and those which&nbsp; are <i> inimical and dangerous&nbsp; to ¦public health, moral or&nbsp; safety.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter case the&nbsp; fee may&nbsp; be very&nbsp; large&nbsp; without&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; being a,&nbsp; tax.",</i> (Cooley on Taxation, Vol.&nbsp; IV, pp.&nbsp; 3516-17;&nbsp; underlining supplied.)<br></blockquote>Evidently, the&nbsp; Manila Municipal Board considered the practice of hygienic and aesthetic massage not as a useful and beneficial&nbsp; occupation which "will promote and is&nbsp; conducive&nbsp; to public morals, and&nbsp; consequently, imposed the said permit fee for its regulation.<br><br>In conclusion,&nbsp; we find and hold that the Ordinance in question&nbsp; as we interpret it and as intended by the appellees is valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; We deem it unnecessary to discuss and&nbsp; pass upon the other points raised&nbsp; in the appeal,&nbsp; the order appealed&nbsp; from is. hereby affirmed.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L. Endencia</i> and <i>Felix, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
