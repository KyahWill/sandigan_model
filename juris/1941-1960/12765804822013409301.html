				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div aign="justify">The question passed by this appeal is identical with that decided recently (August 30, 1950) in Paz Lopez Constantion <em>vs</em>. Asia Life Insurance Co., G.R. No. L-1670, <em>supra</em>,
p. 248. In fact, counsel for appellants herein tell us that the Asia
Life Insurance cases have been filed as a test case for the case at be
and others of similar nature, adding that if the Statham doctrine is
upheld in the test case "judgment here must perforce be affirmed."
<p>The parties submitted a stipulation of facts in the lower court, the pertinent paragraphs of which are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the plaintiffs are of legal age and residents
of Manila. Philippines; and that defendant is a life insurance
corporation, organized under and by virtue of the laws of the Dominion
of Canada and, duly licensed to engage in insurance business in the
Philippines at all times material to the case, with principal place of
business at Toronto, Canada, and branch office at Manila, Philippines;</p>
  <p>"That
on February 7, 1934, defendant's Manila Branch Office issued a policy
on the life of Juan Carrero y Borras, Philippine citizen, under and
pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in policy No. 632496,
attached hereto as Exhibit 'A', signed and sealed at Toronto, Canada;</p>
  <p>"That
semi-annual premiums on said policy up to and including that due on
September 10, 1941, were duly paid by the insured; and receipts similar
to Exhibit 'B' were issued by defendant to the insured; and that the
policy, Exhibit 'A' was in full force and effect when Japanese forces
occupied the City of Manila, on January 2, 1942;</p>
  <p>"That on
June 23, 1941, the insured obtained a cash loan of $6,000 on his
policy as evidenced by the voucher and agreement hereto attached and
made a part hereof as Exhibit 'C' and 'D', respectively; and that since
said cash loan exceeded the cash value of $5,500 available at the time,
the sum of $500 thereof was transferred against the other policy on the
life of the same insured bearing No. 632495 as evidenced by the voucher
and agreement hereto attached and marked Exhibit 'A' is actually
$5,500.00;</p>
  <p>"That the semi-annual premiums on the policy, Exhibit 'A', which became due during the years 1942, 1943 and 1944 were not paid;</p>
  <p>"That
Juan Carrero y Borras died in the Court of Manila on February 17, 1945;
that he was a resident of , and had actually lived in the Philippines
since prior to February 7, 1934, up to the time of his death; and that
plaintiffs were also residents, and were living in, the Philippines,
during the period of enemy invasion;</p>
  <p>"That on or about
January 2, 1942 because of the entry of Japanese forces into the City
of Manila and subsequent occupation of the same, defendant was forced
to close its branch office in the City of Manila; that the defendant
was required to submit and did submit its records to the Finance
Section of the Japanese Military Administration, by virtue of an order
from the said Japanese Military Administration; that defendant's office
in the City of Manila remained closed until October 1, 1945; and that
during the period from January 2, 1942 to February 17, 1945; the
defendant's agent in the Philippines to whom payments of premiums could
have been made by Juan Carrero y Borras, against official receipts of
defendant with facsimile of the General-Manager and signature printed
thereon and counter-signed by said agent, was in the custody of the
Japanese Imperial Forces; while the cashier, who was also authorized to
receive payment was not holding office at the time;</p>
  <p>"That
under the laws and regulation promulgated by the Japanese Military
Administration during the period of enemy occupation, it was not legal
for Juan Carrero y Borras to pay to defendant in the Philippines, and
it would have been illegal for defendant itself to receive in the
Philippines, payments of premiums due on the policy, Exhibit 'A',
defendant contending, however, that payment could have been legally
made to the Fiance Section of the Japanese Military Administration,
while plaintiffs contend that the Finance Section of the Japanese
Military Administration never set up an office nor designated any person
or company to collect premiums or loans or interest, due from foreign
insurance companies, nor was a demand ever made upon policy-holders to
pay their corresponding life insurance premiums, or loans, or
interests, to said custodian or his nominee or agent; and that, as a
matter of fact, it was not legally possible for defendant itself,
during the period of enemy occupation, to have received payments of
premiums in the Philippines from Juan Carrero y Borras, even, if such
payments had been tendered in United States Currency or in Philippine
currency;</p>
  <p>"That during the period of enemy occupation it was
not legally and physically possible for Juan Carrero y Borras to remit
the amount of the premiums due on his policy to defendant's office in
Toronto, Canada, nor was it legally and physically possible for him to
have left the Philippines for Toronto, Canada, in order to make the
payment of premiums there;</p>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
  <p align="left">"That among the 'Particulares' and 'Estipulaciones' of the Insurance Policy, Exhibit 'A', are the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5"><li>Prima pagadera y Fecha en que Vence—Setecientos cuatro Dolares a la
entrega de esta Poliza y una suma igual en lo secesivo cada dia diez de
SEPTIEMBRE y MARZO hasta que se hayan pagado las primas de VEINTE AÑOS
completos.</li></ol>
<ol start="2"><li>Pago de las Primas. * * * * Todas las primas son
pagaderas, sea a la Oficina Principal de la Compañia, o sea a un Agente
o Cajero a cambio del recibo oficial de la Compañia firmado pro un
Agente o Cajero de la Compañia.* * *</li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"That prior to the war, insurance premiums on local
policies payable to defendant in United States currency were paid at
defendant's branch office in the Ciry of Manila, in its equivalent in
Philippine Currency;</p>
  <p align="left">"That Juan Carrero y Borras
had the financial ability and was willing and ready to pay teh premiums
corresponding to said policy, Exhibit 'A', during the period of enemy
occupation; and that in the Intestate Estate of Juan Carrero, No. 70047
of the Court of the Court of First Instance of Manila, a provisional
Inventory was filed on September 19, 1946, wherein the properties were
vauled at P274,153.78;</p>
  <p align="left">"That on December 31,
1941, the cash reserve value of policy, Exhibit 'A', issued to Juan
Carrero y Borras is approximately $5,500.00; against which the cash
loan of $5,500.00 mentioned in Paragraph IV hereof was granted;"</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">In the Asia Life Insurance Co. cases, <em>supra</em>,
we followed the Federal or statham rule in preference to the so-called
Connecticut or New York rule, as one that more accords with the
peculiar nature of insurance contracts, in that actual payment of the
premiums is of the essence of the policy; that premium is not a debt on
which the insurer can be sued, but a privilege performance of which is
a condition precedent to the continuance of the policy, according to
the express agreement of the parties.</p>
<p align="left">There is no use going into this appeal beyond quoting
from this Court's decision in the aforesaid Asia Life Insurance cases,
where the same issues were thoroughly discussed. There, the Court,
speaking through Mr. Justice Bengzon, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">In Glaraga <em>vs</em>. Sun Life Ass.
Co., 49 Phil., 737, this Court held that a life policy was avoided
because the premium had not been paid within the time fixed, since by
its express terms, non-payment of any premium when due or within the
thirty-day period of grace, <em>ipso facto</em> caused the policy to
lapse. This goes to show that served and should not lightly be thrown
out, will we do not hesitate to enforce the agreement of the parties.</p>
  <blockquote><p align="left">Forfeitures
of insurance policies are not favored, but courts cannot for that
reason alone refuse to enforce an insurance contract according to its
meaning. (45 C. J. S., p. 150.)</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p align="left">Nevertheless, it is contended for plaintiffs that
inasmuch as the non-payment of premiums was the consequence of war, it
should be excused and should not cause the forfeiture of the policy.</p>
<p align="left">Professor Vance of Yale, in his standard treatise on
Insurance, says that in determining the effect of non-payment of
premiums occasioned by war, the American cases may be divided into
three groups, according as they support the so-called Connecticut Rule,
the York Rule, or the United States Rule.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p align="left">The United States rule declares that the contract is
not merely suspended, but is abrogated by reason of non-payment of
premium, since the time of the payment is peculiarly of the essence of
the contract. It additionally holds that it would be unjust to allow
the insurer to retain the reserve value of the policy, which is the excess of the premiums paid over the actual risk carried during the
years when the policy had been in force. This rule was announced in the
well-known Statham case which, in the opinion of Professor Vance, <em>is the correct rule</em>.</p>
<p align="left">The appellants and some <em>amici curiae</em> contend that the New York rule should be applied here. The appellee and other <em>amici curiae</em> contend that the United States doctrine is the orthodox view.</p>
<p align="left">We have read and re-read the principal cases upholding
the different theories. Besides the respect and high regard we have
always entertained for decisions of the Supreme Court of the United
States, we cannot resist the conviction that the reasons expounded in
its decisions of the Statham case are logically and juridically
sound.Like the instant case, the policies involved in the Statham
decision specify that non-payment on time shall cause the policy to
cease and determine. Reasoning out that punctual payments were
essential, the Court said:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><p align="left">* * * it must be conceded that
promptness of payment is essential in the business of life insurance.
All the calculations of the insurance company are based on the
hypothesis of prompt payments. They not only calculate on the receipt
of the premiums when due, but on compounding interest upon them. It is
on this basis that they are enabled to offer assurance at the favorable
rates they do. Forfeiture for non-payment is a necessary means of
protecting themselves from embarrassment. Unless it were enforceable,
the business would be thrown into utter confusion. It is like the
forfeiture of share in mining enterprises, and all other hazardous
undertakings. There must be power to cut off unprofitable members, or
the success of the whole scheme is endangered. The insured parties are
associates in a great scheme is endangered. The insured parties are
associated in a great scheme. This associated relation exists whether
the company be a mutual one or not. Each is interested in the
engagements of all; for out of the co-existence of may riks arises the
law of average, which underlies the whole business. An essential
feature of this schem is the mathematical calculations referred to, on
which the premiums and amounts assured are based. Ant these
calculations again, are based on the assumption of average morality,
theron. Delinquency cannot be tolerated nor redeemed, except at the
potion of the company. This has always been the understanding and the
practice of this department of business. Some companies, it is true,
accord a grace of thirty days, or other fixed period, with which the
premium in arrear may be paid, on certain conditions of continued good
health, etc. But this is a matter of stipulation, or of discretion, on
the part of the particular company. When no stipulation exists, it is
the general understanding that time is material, and that the
forfeiture is absolute if the premium coming due, demonstrates the
common view of this matter.</p></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p align="left">The case, therefore,
is one in which time is material and of the essence of the contract.
Non-payment at the day involves absolute forfeiture if such be the
terms of the contract, as is the case here. Courts cannot with safety
vary the stipulation of the parties by introducing equities for the
relief of the insured against their own negligence.</p></blockquote>
  <p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </p>
  <p align="left">The
above considerations certainly lend themselves to the approval of
fair-minded men. Moreover, if, as alleged, the consequences of war
should not prejudice the insured, neither should they bear down on the
insurer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">In view of the foregoing considerations, the judgment
appealed from, holding that the insurance policy in question lapsed by
reason of non-payment of premiums due, is hereby affirmed, with costs of
this appeal against the appellants.</p>
