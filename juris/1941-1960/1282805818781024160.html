The complaint prays for the annulment of a deed of sale 
purporting to convey to defendant F.M., for and in consideration of P400,000, a 
lot with its improvements at 79 San Rafael, Manila. The deed was supposed to 
have been signed in Manila by the spouses S.T. and A.R., who both died in 
February 1945. It was proven that on the date stated in the document of sale, 
S.T. was not in Manila; that plaintiff had asked S.T. whether she was selling 
the house on Calle San Rafael and she answered that she was not and will never 
sell it. A handwriting expert testified that the signatures on the said document 
of sale were false. Considering all the evidence in the case, the court <i>is 
convinced</i> that the deed of sale is a forgery.</div>
