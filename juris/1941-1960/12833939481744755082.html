				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This controversy over a five-hectare land in Ilocos Norte between 
the Cruz and the Quevedo families, started in 1932. Despite three 
litigations won by the latter, it still occupies the courts' attention. 
It should have ended in June 1942 when this Tribunal decided G. R. No. 
L-48790 between the same parties; but the shrewdness of counsel 
exploiting a clerical error, managed to prolong the dispute.
  <p>  In October 1932, Teodora de la Cruz, the predecessor of the 
present plaintiffs, filed (with others) an application for registration 
of a parcel of land of more than 90 hectares (Registration Case No. 
241). Among the oppositors were Santos Quevedo, (ascendant of present 
defendants) who asserted ownership over a 5-hectare portion. Cruz 
prevailed in the court of first instance. The Court of Appeals, upon 
review, approved the registration, but modified it by sustaining the 
opposition and claim of Quevedo in these lines, immediately following a 
complete description of the 5-hectare not claimed by him:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "por la proponderancia de las pruebas, dicha porcion <u>debe 
excluirse de la solicitud y adjudicarse a Santos Quevedo x x x"</u></p>
    <p>    x x x</p>
    <p>"Por las consideraciones expuestas, modificamos la sentencia 
apelada, estimando las oposiones de Felix Ponce, de los herederos de 
David Flor y de Santos Quevedo, desestimando todas las demas, y <u>adjudicando
 a ellos las porciones reclamadas por los referidos opositores</u> 
Ponce, Flor y Quevado, sujeto a los contratos exhibitos O, P y Q 
otorgados entre aquellos y los opositores llamados zanjeros. x x x Los 
solicitantes deben presentar un plano enmendado de acuerdo con esta 
decision, y dentro del pplazo que el Juzgado inferior designe. x x x."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>  (Note: the words underlined in the above quotation are pivotal in
 the case at bar.)</p>
  <p>  The Court of Appeals decision became final. Thus, upon the return
 of the expediente (Registration Case No. 241) the Ilocos Norte Court of
 First Instance required Cruz to submit an amended plan of the real 
property by excluding the portions <u>adjudicated</u> [sic] to Santos 
Quevedo, (Felix Ponce and Herederos de David Flor ... other successful 
oppositors). Unwilling to submit such amended plan and maintaining that 
the portion adjudged to Santos Quevedo was not included in the plan 
originally submitted by her, Teodora Cruz came to this Court with a 
certiorari petition challenging the order. Her petition, however, was 
dismissed in January 1940 by a resolution that ended with these words: x
 x x el Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Ilocos Norte no solamente obro 
dentro de su jurisdiccion sino que obro <u>precisamente en cumplimiento</u>
 de la decision dictada por el Tribunal de Apelaciones."</p>
  <p>  This 1940 decision, however, in quoting the dispositive part of 
the Court of Appeals' decision omitted or rephrased through clerical 
mistake or erroneous transcription the portion which reads "y 
adjudicando a ellos las porciones reclamadas por los referidos 
opositores Ponce, Flor y Quevado."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 We say it was a mistake because the official copy of the decision 
attached to Registration Case No. 241 contains the omitted portion; and 
the very 1940 decision makes an acknowledgement that certain parcels <u>had
 been adjudicated</u> to the oppositors Santos Quevedo, Felix Ponce and 
Herederos de David Flor.</p>
  <p>  After 1940, Quevedo took steps to carry out the Court of Appeals 
decision in his favor; but Cruz presented again a petition to review, on
 the ground of fraud, the award in favor of Quevedo, which fraud was 
made to consist in the manifestation of Quevedo that "the land applied 
for by Cruz included parcels belonging to him", when in fact it did not.
 The petition was denied â€” naturally, because the alleged fraud being 
intrinsic could not justify reopening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> And when she appealed the denial, the court disallowed 
the appeal. She took the matter to this Court by petition for mandamus 
(G. R. No. L-48790). However, such petition was here dismissed in June 
1942, because as this Court found, "the motion for revision can have 
evidently no other purpose than malicious delay, and the appeal taken 
from the order denying such motion is frivolous." This decision again 
expressly referred to the parcel that "had been adjudged" to Quevedo.</p>
  <p>  These rebuffs notwithstanding, Cruz continued to refuse to submit
 an amended plan, as directed by the Court of Appeals, showing the area 
claimed by and adjudicated to Quevedo. So, the latter obtained a court 
decree permitting a government surveyor to prepare the technical plan 
thereof. Upon submission of the surveyor's plan, the court ordered, in 
December 1946, the Sheriff to put Quevedo in possession of the land 
therein described. This order was accordingly complied with.</p>
  <p>  Four years later, i. e. in September 1950, the heirs of Cruz 
initiated the present lawsuit of <u>reivindicacion</u>, alleging they 
had been illegally deprived of the land given to the Quevedos by the 
Sheriff.</p>
  <p>  There is no doubt that the land was identically the same parcel 
described in the opposition and claim submitted by Quevedo in the 
original Registration Case No. 241. Nevertheless, plaintiffs contend it 
was not adjudicated to Quevedo in that Case No. 241; and they rely 
principally on the <u>mistaken quotation in our decision of 1940</u> in 
the certiorari case. Fortunately, however, the court of first instance 
took cognizance of its own records, and following the tenor of the 
official copy of the Court of Appeals decision attached to Registration 
Case No. 241, correctly held that the parcel had been adjudicated to 
Quevedo. Indeed, our very decision of 1940 explicitly approved the lower
 court's order to segregate from the original plan "las porciones <u>adjudicadas</u>
 a los opositores Quevedo, x x x." Therein, we thought the court "obro 
precisamente en cumplimiento de la decision dictada por el Tribunal de 
Apelaciones."</p>
  <p>  In fact, up to 1950 when this case was instituted, the court of 
first instance in several directives, ad this Court, have regarded the 
lot as awarded to Santos Quevedo.</p>
  <p>  It is now too late to aver, as appellants do, that such piece of 
land was not included in Registration Case No. 241, or was different 
from the lot he claimed in said registration proceeding or that he had 
no title to it. The Court of Appeals' decision constitutes <u>res 
judicata</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on the point 
of Quevedo's ownership.</p>
  <p>    Consequently, the lower court's dismissal of the instant 
attempt to recover the land from his successors must be, and is hereby 
affirmed, with costs against appellants.
