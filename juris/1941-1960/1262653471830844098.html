				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before&nbsp; February 4, 1957, petitioner Lauro B. Isidro was duly authorized to&nbsp; operate and had been operating TPU jeepneys&nbsp; on the&nbsp; following lines:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="61%"><div align="left">North Harbor—Sta. Mesa via<br> Quiapo and Divisoria<br> </div></td> <td valign="bottom" width="20%"><div align="right">3&nbsp; units</div></td> <td width="19%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="left"></div></td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right"></div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="left">Camp Murphy— Divisoria via <br> Sta. Mesa</div></td> <td valign="bottom"> <div align="right">3 units</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>and respondent Raymundo Ocampo was authorized to operate and was operating on the following lines:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="61%"><div align="left">Sta. Mesa—Divisoria<br> </div></td> <td valign="bottom" width="20%"><div align="right">&nbsp; 2 units</div></td> <td width="19%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="left">Blumentritt—Piers</div></td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">2 units</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="left">Velasquez—Plaza, Miranda</div></td> <td valign="bottom"> <div align="right">4 units</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>North Harbor—Divisoria</td> <td valign="bottom"><div align="right">3 units</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>North Harbor—South&nbsp; Harbor</td> <td valign="bottom"> <div align="right">3 units</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On the date above mentioned, Ocampo filed an application to modify and consolidate his&nbsp; lines and re-route his 14 units so as to reduce his&nbsp; lines to only two, namely, Velasquez Plaza Miranda ma Divisoria with 7 units instead of 4, and&nbsp; North Harbor-Plaza Miranda via Divisoria with 7&nbsp; units thereby&nbsp; eliminating his 3&nbsp; lines,&nbsp; Sta. Mesa-Divisoria, Blumentritt-Piers, and North Harbor-South Harbor. The reason for said application as shown by the evidence presented in support of the same was that the volume of passenger&nbsp; traffic from Velasquez to Plaza Miranda had increased, thereby justifying the addition of 3 units from 4 to 7 and that&nbsp; passengers from North Harbor to&nbsp; Plaza Miranda would have to disembark&nbsp; either at Divisoria or at the corner of Quezon Boulevard and Azcarraga and take another jeepney to Plaza Miranda; and those from Plaza Miranda to North Harbor would have to get down either at the corner of Evangelista&nbsp; and Azcarraga or at Divisoria and board another jeepney for North Harbor, in either case, having to pay an extra 10&nbsp; centavos, thereby justifying the extension&nbsp; of his lines from North Harbor to Divisoria up to Plaza Miranda and the increase of his units from 3 to 7.<br><br>Petitioner Isidro, together with some big bus, taxi and jeepney operators filed written oppositions.&nbsp; However, during the several hearings held by the Public Service&nbsp; Commission on the application,&nbsp; only Isidro was left to prosecute his position and&nbsp; introduce evidence in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of the same.&nbsp; By order&nbsp; of April 1, 1957, the Public Service Commission overruled the oppositions and&nbsp; granted the application.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isidro in his&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from said&nbsp; order makes the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote>1, The Public Service Commission erred in its order of April 1, 1957 in not finding that petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; financially capable, ready, and willing to improve,&nbsp; through increase&nbsp; of equipments, his service&nbsp; on the line North Harbor-Sta. Mesa&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">via </span>Quiapo.<br><br>2. The PSC erred&nbsp; in its order of April 1, 1957&nbsp; granting respondent Raymundo Ocampo's application to&nbsp; operate seven (7) jitney units on the&nbsp; line North&nbsp; Harbor — Plaza&nbsp; Miranda (Quiapo), without first granting ah opportunity to petitioner&nbsp; Lauro B. Isidro as prior operator to improve, through increase&nbsp; of equipments,&nbsp; his service along that line.<br></blockquote>In the present&nbsp; appeal, only&nbsp; the line North Harbor-Plaza Miranda granted&nbsp; to Ocampo with 7 units&nbsp; is involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; The burden of the opposition of petitioner Isidro is that&nbsp; he&nbsp; is an old operator on this line; and following the well-settled rule&nbsp; laid&nbsp; down&nbsp; in a line of&nbsp; cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>,&nbsp; before others like respondent Ocampo&nbsp; are authorized to operate on the line: in question, he (petitioner) as an old operator, should be&nbsp; given an opportunity or preference to&nbsp; improve&nbsp; his service if deficient or inadequate or to add trips to his present service if found necessary.&nbsp; The trouble is that&nbsp; petitioner is not really&nbsp; and&nbsp; strictly speaking&nbsp; an&nbsp; operator on the&nbsp; line&nbsp; in question,&nbsp; namely, North Harbor-Plaza Miranda and <span style="font-style: italic;">vice versa.</span>&nbsp; It is true that he operates the line&nbsp; North&nbsp; Harbor Sta.&nbsp; Mesa <span style="font-style: italic;">via </span>Quiapo, but his line does not pass by&nbsp; Plaza Miranda.<br><br>The line or stretch of road really involved in petitioner's opposition is that&nbsp; portion of Azcarraga street between Divisoria and Quezon Boulevard.&nbsp;&nbsp; On this line,&nbsp; petitioner may be considered an&nbsp; old operator, but so is respondent on his lines&nbsp; Velasquez-Plaza .Miranda&nbsp; and Sta. Mesa-Divisoria, with the advantage that on the former line, respondent&nbsp; is operating a line from the corner of Quezon Boulevard and Azcarraga up to Plaza Miranda.&nbsp; Consequently, petitioner's contention of preference to be given to old operators is untenable.&nbsp; Moreover, even assuming for a moment that petitioner were an old operator on&nbsp; the&nbsp; line in&nbsp; question, nevertheless he has not applied for an increase in his service but allowed&nbsp; another to do so; and&nbsp; according to a line of decisions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> it has been ruled that the granting of preference to an old operator applies only when said old operator has made an offer to meet the increase in traffic and not when another operator even a new one, like respondent Ocampo, has made the offer to serve the new line or increase the service on&nbsp; said line.<br><br>At the beginning,&nbsp; we entertained some doubts about granting the line North&nbsp; Harbor-Plaza Miranda via Divisoria to respondent for the reason that the main if not the only reason for the application on said line was the relatively short distance&nbsp; (involving a few hundred meters) between the corner of Quezon Boulevard and Azcarraga and Plaza Miranda, which passengers could well negotiate on&nbsp; foot.&nbsp; However, the&nbsp; Public Service Commission after due consideration has&nbsp; found&nbsp; it a good and adequate reason for the purpose of serving the public.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, during the rainy season it might really be inconvenient for passengers bound for Plaza Miranda to walk the distance from the corner of Quezon Boulevard&nbsp; and Azcarraga&nbsp; street to their destination, so that they would be forced to board another jeepney&nbsp; and pay 10 centavos.<br><br>Finding no error in the order appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
