<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>On August 21, 1946, appellee filed a motion praying for the execution of the 
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered, on January 22, 1946, 
in order that appellant may be ousted from the premises in question, because he 
failed to pay or deposit on or before August 10, 1946, the rent of P25 for the 
preceding month of July.</p>
<p>Not denying said failure, appellant alleges (a) that, besides having filed 
the appeal bond of P60, he deposited with the clerk of the court of first 
instance on October 6, 1945, a four-month rent supersedeas bond which, according 
to the appellee, amounted only to P80; and (b) that section 9 of Rule 72 of the 
Rules of Court does not require the monthly rentals to be paid or deposited 
within the first ten days of the calendar month.</p>
<p>The supersedeas bond in the amount of P80, deposited by appellant, does not 
relieve him from the obligation of paying or depositing the current rents 
pending his appeal to the Supreme Court, as we had already declared in the case 
of Mitschiener <i>vs.</i> Barrios, (76 Phil., 55), that the purpose 
of the supersedeas bond in ejectment cases is to insure the payment of the 
unpaid back rents or reasonable value of the use of the premises in question, 
but not to take the place of the payment or deposit of the current ones.</p>
<p>Section 9 of Rule 72 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 9. <em>Stay of execution on appeal to Court of Appeals or Supreme 
Court</em>.—Where defendant appeals from judgment of the Court of First 
Instance, execution of said judgment shall not be stayed unless the appellant 
pays either to the plaintiff or into the appellate court the same amounts 
referred to in the preceding section to be disposed of in the same manner as 
therein provided."</p></blockquote>
<p>Although it is a fact that the above provision does not specify when the 
monthly rents, as fomd in the decision of the court of first instance, must be 
paid, reason counsels that the payment or deposit of said rents pending appeal 
to the Supreme Court can not be left to the discretion of appellant. Section 8 
of Rule 72 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 8. <em>Immediate, execution of judgdment. How to stay same</em>.—If 
judgment is rendered against the defendant, execution shall issue immediately, 
unless an appeal has been perfected and the defendant to stay execution files a 
sufficient bond approved by the justice of the peace or municipal court and 
executed to the plaintiff to enter the action in the Court of First Instance, 
and to pay the rents, damages, and costs down to the time of the final judgment 
in the action, and unless, during the pendency of the appeal, he pays to the 
plaintiff or to the Court of First Instance the amount of rent due from time to 
time under the contract, if any, as found by the judgment of the justice of the 
peace or municipal court to exist, or, in the absence of a contract, he pays to 
the plaintiff or into the court, on or before the tenth day of each calendar 
month, the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises for the 
preceding month at the rate determined by the judgment. All moneys so paid to 
the Court of First Instance shall be deposited in the provincial treasury, or in 
the City of Manila in the Insular Treasury, and shall be held there until the 
final disposition of the appeal. Should the defendant fail to make the payments 
above prescribed from time to time during the pendency of the appeal, the Court 
of First Instance, upon motion of the plaintiff, of which the defendant shall 
have notice, and upon proof of such failure, shall order the execution of the 
judgment appealed from, but such execution shall not be a bar to the appeal 
taking its course until the final disposition thereof on its merits. If the case 
is tried on its merits in the Court of First Instance, any money paid into court 
by the defendant for the purposes of stay of execution shall be disposed of in 
accordance with the provisions of the judgment of the Court of First Instance, 
and in any case wherein it appears that the defendant has been deprived of the 
lawful possession of land or building pending the appeal by virtue of the 
execution of the judgment of the justice of the peace or municipal court, 
damages for such deprivation of possession may be allowed the defendant in the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance disposing of the appeal. The bond above 
referred to shall be transmitted by the justice of the peace or munioipal court, 
with the other papers, to the clerk of the Court of First Instance to which the 
action is appealed." </p></blockquote>
<p>There being en analogy between the legal position of the parties when the 
case is pending appeal from the justice of the peace court to the Court of First 
Instance the one when the case is pending appeal from the Court of First 
Instance to the Supreme Court, it is logical that similar procedure must be 
followed in both situations, tod this interpretation, besides being fair to both 
parties, is in a sense more favorable to the tenant as he is given ten 
additional days within which to pay or deposit the rent, as otherwise he will 
ordinarily be compelled to make said monthly payment or deposit not<br>later 
than the last day of the month for which the rent must be paid.</p>
<p>Appellee's petition for the execution of the appealed decision of the lower 
court is granted,without prejudice to the appeal Interposed by 
defendant.</p>Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, and Tuason, JJ., concur.

<p><strong>FERIA, J.</strong><em>,</em> with whom concurs <strong>MORAN, C. 
J.:</strong></p>
<p>We concur in the result.</p>
<p>We have already decided in the case of Mitschiener vs. Barrios, (76 Phil., 
55), that a supersedeas bond filed in the justice of the peace or municipal 
court does not relieve the defendant-appellant from making the payments required 
in section 8, Rule 72, to suspend the execution of the judgment during the 
pendency of the appeal. Therefore the only question for us to determine is 
whether or not, under section 9 of the same Rule, if the defendant appeals from 
the judgment of the Court of First Instance, he is required to make the payments 
in the manner provided in section 8 of rents or compensation for the use and 
occupation of the property due from time to time during the pendency of the 
appeal, to prevent the execution of the judgment appealed from.</p>
<p>Section 8 of Rule 72 provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 8. <em>Immediate execution of Judgment. How to stay same</em>.— If 
judgment is rendered against the defendant, execution shall issue immediately, 
unless an appeal has been perfected and the defendant to stay execution files a 
sufficient bond approved by the Justice of the peace or municipal court and 
executed to the plaintiff to enter the action in the Court of First Instance, 
and to pay the rents, damages, and costs down to the time of the final judgment 
in the action, and unless, during the pendency of the appeal, he pays to the 
plaintiff or to the Court of First Instance the amount of rent due from time to 
time under the contract, if any, as found by the judgment of the justice of the 
peace or municipal court to exist, or, in the absence of a contract, he pays to 
the plaintiff or into the court, on or before the tenth day of each calendar 
month, the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises for the 
preceding month at the rate determined by the judgment. All moneys so paid to 
the Court of First Instance shall be deposited in the provincial treasury, or in 
the City of Manila in the Insular Treasury, and shall be held there until the 
final disposition of the appeal. Should the defendant fail to make the payments 
above prescribed from time to time during the pendency of the appeal, the Court 
of First Instance, upon motion of the plaintiff, of which the defendant shall 
have notice, and upon proof of such failure, shall order the execution of the 
judgment appealed from, but such execution shall not be a bar to the appeal 
taking its course until the final disposition thereof on its merits. * * 
*"</p></blockquote>
<p>And section 9 of the same rule reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 9. <em>Stay of execution on appeal to Court of Appeals or Supreme 
Court</em>.—Where defendant appeals from judgment of the Court of First 
Instance, execution of said judgment shall not be stayed unless the appellant 
pays either to the plaintiff or into the appellate court the same amounts 
referred to in the preceding section to be disposed of in the same manner as 
therein provided." </p></blockquote>
<p>It is a well settled that "the rule that a relative or qualifying word refers 
to its last antecedent is not invariable. It will yield to the evident sense and 
meaning of the statute. It is a rule of grammar, and a statute is presumed to be 
grammatically expressed. But this will not be told in the fact of the apparent 
and rational interpretation of the act. 'It is true that in strict grammatical 
construction, the relative ought to apply to the last antecedent; but there are 
numerous examples in the in best writers to show that the context may often 
require a deviation from this rule, and that the relative may be connected with 
nouns which go before the last antecedent, and either take from it or give to it 
some qualification.' * * * Also it is said that general words occurring at the 
end of a sentence are presumed to refer to and qualify the whole, * * *." (Black 
on Interpretation of Laws, pp. 224-226, Second Edition)</p>
<p>For instance, in the case of Hart <em>vs.</em> Kennedy, (14 Abb. Prac. [N. 
Y.] 432), a statute provided that certain officers should not be "liable to 
military or jury duty, nor to arrest on civil process, or to service of 
subpoenas from civil courts, whilst actually on duty." According to the usual 
rules, of English composition, the qualifying phrase "whilst actually on duty" 
would apply only to the last antecedent, "service of subpoenas," etc. But it was 
held that this would not carry out the plain and evident intention of the 
legislature, and consequently the act should be read as exempting these persons, 
whilst actually on duty, both from arrest and from the service of process. Again 
in Eby's Appeal, (70 Pa. 311), a statute authorized exterritorial service of 
process on nonresident defendants in suits in equity "concerning goods, 
chattels, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, or for the perpetuating of 
testimony concerning any lands, tenements, and so forth, situate or being within 
the jurisdiction of such court." It was held that the qualifying phrase "situate 
or being within the jurisdiction" referred not merely to the last antecedent, 
"perpetuating of testimony," etc., but also to the first clause of the sentence 
quoted. (Black on Interpretation of Laws, p. 225.)</p>
<p>Applying the above rule in construeing the above quoted provision of section 
9, the words "in the same manner as therein provided" must be considered as 
qualifying not only the words "to be disposed of" immediately preceding, but 
also the words "the appellant pays either to the plaintiff or into the appellate 
court the same amounts," which go before the last antecedent, in order to effect 
a meaning clearly shown by, or to carry out an intent expressed in, the above 
quoted provision of section 8 of the said Rule.</p>
<p>The reason of the law or section 8, Rule 72 in requiring the payment or 
deposit of rents or reasonable compensation for the use of the premises by 
defendant-appellant due from time to time during the pendency of the appeal, is 
to seoure or guarantee the right of the plaintiff to such rents and 
compensations should the Court of First Instance affirm the judgment of the 
lower court. As the same reason exist during the pendenoy of the appeal from the 
Court of First Instance to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, it is 
evident that the intention of the law making body in providing in section 9 for 
the payment by defendant appellant to the plaintiff or into the appellate court 
the same amounts referred to him in section 8, is to have said payments effected 
in the same manner as provided in said section 8, Rule 72.</p><br><br><br>

<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the foregoing resolution. However, I would make it clear that, in 
my opinion, under section 9, in relation with section 8 of Rule 72, when there 
is a contract of lease between the parties, the time for the payment or deposit 
of the rentals, during the pendency of the appeal in this court, the same as 
during the pendency of the appeal in the Court of First Instance, is determined 
by the contract of lease: so that in such a case, in ay opinion, said rentals 
should be paid or deposited as they become "due from time to time under the 
contract", in the textual words of said section 8. As I construe this section, 
the payment or deposit required by it to be made "on or before the tenth day of 
each calendar month" (textual words of the section) refers to the payment of 
"the reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises for the 
preceding month" (again textual words of the section), of course, where there is 
no contract between the parties. There being a contract, any change in the due 
date determined by the contract would impair the obligation thereof.</p>
<p><strong>BRIONES, M.,</strong> disidente:</p>
<p>No estoy conforme con la resolucion de la mayoria, por las siguientes 
razones:</p>
<p>(a) Es verdad que el apelante no deposito en la Escribania de esta Corte el 
alquiler correpondiente a Julio proximo pasado antes del 10 Agosto, pero algunos 
dias despues lo hizo y, ademas, deposito por adelantado el alquiler de Agosto. 
El Articulo 9, regla 72, del Reglamento de los Tribunales, no provee 
especificamente que los alquileres deberan depositarse en la Escrabania de esta 
Corte durante los diez primeros dias de cada mes, en notorio contraste con el 
articulo 8 que contiene esa disposicion concreta y espicifica con relacion a los 
Juzgados de Primera Instancia. El mencionado articulo 9 solo dice que se 
dispondra delos alquires depositados en la forma provista en el articulo 
anterior.</p>
<p>Se arguye, sin embargo, que como quiera que el articulo 9 no señala plazo 
para los depositos, por analogia debe regir el plazo de que habla el articulo 8. 
COnvengo en que estamos facultados para formular esta interpretacion. Desde 
luego lo mejor y mas correcto seria que se enmendase antes el precepto, 
eslabonando ambas disposiciones legales con la fraseologia propia, clara, 
categorica y pertinente. Pero si se quiere el camino mas corto, estoy dispuesto 
a conformarme con que ello se haga por medio de interpretacion judicial 
simplemente. Lo que no me parece aceptable y justo es que la doctrina se aplique 
de hoy en adelante, es decir, <em>in furturo</em>. Razones de equidad aconsejan 
este proceder. La ejecucion de la sentencia en un caso de desahucio es siempre 
algo oneroso, maxime en las presentes circumstancias en que el problema del 
albergue es extraordinariamente dificil; asi que no se debe favorecer durante la 
pendencia de la apelacion a menos que lo justifique una disposicion legal 
terminante o una doctrina firmemente es tablecida, y no es este el caso que 
tenemos, pues ya hemos visto que la frasiologia del articulo 9 arriba citado es 
vaga e emprisa, siendo esta, la primera vez que lo interinterpretamos 
ampliandolo, por analogia, en relacion con el articulo 8.</p>
<p>(b) Consta en autos que el apelante, ademas de su fianza de apelacion, 
registro en la escribania del Juzgado de Primera Instancia otrat fianza para 
suspender la ejucucion de la sentencia (<em>supersedeas bond</em>) por luma de 
P80, esto es equivalente a cuatro meses de alquiler. Teniendo en cuenta que el 
retraso en esta instancia del deposito del alquiler correspondiente a Julio ha 
sido solo por algunos dias y que inclusive el alquiler de Agosto se ha 
depositado por adelantado, de suerte que ahora el apelante estal al corriente de 
su obligacion, creo que no se causa ningun perjuicio a la parte apelada no 
ordenando la ejecucion de la sentencia a su favor. La Filosofia de la ley no es 
que se trate de de favorecer particularmente a la parte demandante y vencedora 
con a la ejucucion de la sentencia durante la pendencia de la apelacion, sino 
tan solo de asegurar sus intereses contra la morosidad del demandado; asi que 
cuandro de autos resulta evidente, como en el presente caso, que los intereses 
de la demandante y apelada estan asegurados con exceso y ningun daño puede 
seguirse de la no ejecucion de la sentencia, esta no debe decretarse so pena de 
darle un caracter estrictamente punitivo, lo cual no es la intencion de la 
ley.</p>
<p>(c) El espiritu de algunas de nuestras recientes decisiones abona en favor de 
la tesis que sostengo en esta desidencia. En el asunto de Mitschiener <em>contra 
</em>Barrios y otros (76 Phil., 55) hemos declarado que la fianza para suspender 
la ejucucion de la sentencia (<em>supersedeas bond</em>) tiene por objeto 
asegurar el pago de los alquileres atrasados o devengados. Pero la decision mas 
aplicable al caso que nos ocupa es la recaida en el asunto de Caluag DOmingo 
<em>contra</em> Juzgado de Primera Instancia de Nueva Ecija. (p. 170, ante), en 
el cual tambien se pidio la ejecucion de la sentencia la pendencia de la 
apelacion por no haber el demandando pagado ni depositado los alquileres 
vencidos. Alli hemos dejado sin afecto la orden de ejucucion de la sentencia 
expedida por el tribunal inferior porque de autos resultaba que el demandado 
habia depositado una <em>"supersedeas bond"</em> de P1,000—fianza que cubria con 
exceso alquileres atrasados, los cuales montaban solamente a P290. Alli hemos 
hecho justicia sustancial, por encima de tecnicismos. El asunto que nos ocupa es 
perfectamente analogo al citado ultamamente, porque, como ya se ha dicho, el 
apelante en el presente caso presto ante el Juzgado de Primera Instancian una 
fianza de "<em>supersedeas</em>" por la suma de P80, esto es, equivalent a 4 
meses de alquiler, y el retraso en esta instancia ha sido solo por un mes, y aun 
eso ya se halla subsanado. Mas todavia: la posicion del demandado en el presente 
caso es hasta mojor que en el asunto de Caluag, <em>supra</em>, porque alli la 
morosidad del demandado cubria varios meses.</p>
<p>Mi conclusion, pues, es que debe denegarse el pedimento de ejucucuion sin 
perjuico de sentar desde hoy la docrtina de que el articulo 9 debe interpretarse 
por analogia en relacion con el articulo 8, a saber: que los alquileres deben 
depositarse en la Escribania de este Corte dentro de los primeros 10 dias de 
cada mes al igual que en los primeros 10 dias de cada mes al igual que en los 
Juzgados de Primera Instancia.</p>
