				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">[.&nbsp; May 23, 1957] In&nbsp; eleven&nbsp; (11)&nbsp; separate informations of the&nbsp; same tenor, <i>John&nbsp; Canson&nbsp; Jr</i>.,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al. were,&nbsp;&nbsp; on&nbsp;&nbsp; November&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; .1954, charged&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace Courts, of Makati, San Juan del Monte, Mandaluyong and&nbsp; Paranaque,&nbsp; Rizal, with&nbsp; the&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 195&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, committed&nbsp; as follows: <br><blockquote>"That, on or about the&nbsp; 28th&nbsp; day of&nbsp; July, 1954,&nbsp; and for sometime prior&nbsp; thereto, in the municipality of Makati, province of&nbsp; Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Court, the abovenamed accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; another, did,&nbsp; then,&nbsp; and&nbsp; there willfully, unlawfully and&nbsp; feloniously take&nbsp; part in the exploitation or use&nbsp; of&nbsp; slot machines&nbsp;&nbsp; (jackpots)&nbsp; as maintainer and. operator; which&nbsp; are mechanical inventions or contrivances&nbsp; to&nbsp; determine by chance&nbsp; the loser or winner&nbsp; of money&nbsp; or any&nbsp; object representative of value&nbsp; and/or mechanical inventions&nbsp; or contrivances used as a game&nbsp; of&nbsp; scheme, the result of which&nbsp; depends wholly or&nbsp; chiefly upon&nbsp; chance, or hazard, and&nbsp; permit&nbsp; the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of said&nbsp; slot machines&nbsp; in their place of business." </blockquote>In&nbsp; each of&nbsp; said cases counsel&nbsp; for the accused filed&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; quash on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of&nbsp; prescription.&nbsp; The Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Courts dismissed all said&nbsp; cases.&nbsp; The Provincial Fiscal appealed&nbsp; said&nbsp; orders of dismissal to the Court of First Instance of Rizal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Involving&nbsp; as&nbsp; they did a&nbsp; common question&nbsp; of law, by&nbsp; agreement of&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties, all&nbsp; the cases were heard jointly,&nbsp; after&nbsp; which, the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; affirmed the&nbsp;&nbsp; appealed orders&nbsp; of dismissal.&nbsp; The prosecution is now appealing said order to us.<br><br>The lower&nbsp; court ruled that the offense charged in each case. was. a&nbsp; light&nbsp; felony under&nbsp; paragraph 3 of Article 9 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads: <br><blockquote>"Light&nbsp; felonies are those infractions&nbsp; of law for the commission of which&nbsp; the penalty&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>arresto menor</i> or a&nbsp; fine&nbsp; not exceeding 200&nbsp; pesos or both,&nbsp; is provided.", and applied article&nbsp; 90 of the same Code, the fifth&nbsp; paragraph of&nbsp; which&nbsp; reads: </blockquote> "Light&nbsp; offenses prescribe&nbsp; in&nbsp; two months." The Solicitor&nbsp; General cites Article 26&nbsp; of the same Code which provides: <br><blockquote>"Art. 26. Fine—<i>When afflictive, correctional,&nbsp; or light&nbsp; penalty</i>.— A fine, whether imposed as a&nbsp; single, or as an alternative penalty, shall be considered&nbsp; an&nbsp; afflictive penalty, if it exceeds 6,000 pesos; a correctional&nbsp; penalty,&nbsp; if it&nbsp; does not&nbsp; exceed 6,000&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; but&nbsp; is not&nbsp; less&nbsp; than 200&nbsp; pesos; and&nbsp; a light penalty, if it&nbsp; be less than 200&nbsp; pesos."</blockquote>and contends that inasmuch as the penalty imposable&nbsp; under Article&nbsp; 195&nbsp; of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code is <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span>, or&nbsp; a fine&nbsp; not exceeding 200 pesos,&nbsp; then a&nbsp;&nbsp; fine of&nbsp; 200 pesos, imposable&nbsp; as&nbsp; a single or&nbsp; as an&nbsp; alternative penalty, may be&nbsp; considered as a correctional penalty and&nbsp; so&nbsp; under Article 90 of the same Code whose paragraph&nbsp; 2 reads: . <br><blockquote>"Those&nbsp; punishable by&nbsp; a correctional penalty shall prescribe in&nbsp; ten years;&nbsp; with the exception&nbsp; of those&nbsp; punishable by <i>arresto&nbsp; mayor</i>, which shall prescribe in five years.",</blockquote>the offense&nbsp; charged prescribes&nbsp; in ten years&nbsp; and not two months. <br><br>We deem it unnecessary to enter into an extended and elaborate discussion of the legal point raised in this appeal, for the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; that we&nbsp; have&nbsp; already&nbsp; passed upon and ruled&nbsp; on the same in&nbsp; at least two&nbsp; cases,&nbsp; as&nbsp; recently as last year.&nbsp; In the case of the People of&nbsp; the Philippines vs: Yu Hai <i>alias</i> "Haya",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> G. R. No. L-9598, August 15, 1956, this&nbsp; Tribunal, through Mr. Justice J.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Reyes, held that&nbsp; a violation of Article&nbsp; 195 of, the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, punishable with <i>arresto menor</i> or a fine not exceeding P200.00, is&nbsp; a&nbsp; light&nbsp; felony&nbsp; under&nbsp; Article 9 of said Code&nbsp; and prescribes in two months, according to Article 90, paragraph&nbsp; 6, of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason behind our ruling is well&nbsp; explained in the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said ruling was reiterated and applied in&nbsp; our decision&nbsp; through Mr. Justice Bautista&nbsp; Angelo,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; more recent case of The People of the Philippines vs. Pedro Aquino,&nbsp; et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup>&nbsp; G.&nbsp; R. Nos. L-9357-70,&nbsp; promulgated on August 21, 1956, which involved&nbsp; the same&nbsp; violation of Article&nbsp; 195&nbsp; of the Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, particularly the exploitation&nbsp; or use&nbsp; of slot machines (jackpots). <br><br>We&nbsp; see&nbsp; no reason&nbsp; for&nbsp; abandoning&nbsp; the doctrine laid down in&nbsp; said two cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we realize the conflict or discrepancy between&nbsp; Articles 9&nbsp; and 26&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code, as&nbsp; pointed&nbsp; out&nbsp; by the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court and&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution.&nbsp; It would&nbsp; greatly be&nbsp;&nbsp; desirable&nbsp; if the Legislature resolved this conflict by suitable legislation, or amendment of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The Executive Department, through the&nbsp; office of the&nbsp; Secretary, of. Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General, might make representations&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Legislature&nbsp; as to&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessity&nbsp; or wisdom of making an&nbsp; exception&nbsp; in the case of a violation of the gambling law&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 195&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised&nbsp; Penal Code), classified&nbsp; as a light offense,&nbsp; for purposes&nbsp; of prescription.&nbsp; It has always been&nbsp; the&nbsp; policy&nbsp; of the Government to&nbsp; curb and minimize, even eliminate, the evils&nbsp; of&nbsp; gambling, specially in the form of slot machines, popularly known&nbsp; as "one-arm bandits", which are often patronized by that element of the community which could least afford to lose money on the same, not&nbsp; realizing the inexorable law of averages, namely, that&nbsp; despite occasional and&nbsp; rare hits of the jackpot, in the long run,&nbsp; they&nbsp; always&nbsp; lose. Or if the Legislature&nbsp; is not favorably&nbsp; inclined towards the amendment suggested, the Department of Justice might . brief and circularize prosecuting attorneys&nbsp; to be&nbsp; more alert in the&nbsp; prosecution of&nbsp; violations of the&nbsp; gambling law, so that the corresponding complaints or&nbsp; informations could&nbsp; be&nbsp; filed within the&nbsp; present prescriptive period of two months. <br><br>The present case&nbsp; involves no less than eleven&nbsp; separate violations&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; gambling&nbsp; law&nbsp; (exploitation&nbsp; of&nbsp; slot machines), and the&nbsp; last cited&nbsp; case, of&nbsp; the The People of the&nbsp; Philippines vs.&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Aquino,&nbsp; et&nbsp; a]., 99 Phil.,&nbsp; 713, involved no&nbsp; less&nbsp; than&nbsp; fourteen&nbsp; separate cases,&nbsp; also for operating the same&nbsp;&nbsp; slot machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; informations in all these cases had to be quashed, hot because the persons accused were&nbsp; not&nbsp; guilty, but simply because the prosecuting attorneys&nbsp; filed the informations beyond the&nbsp; relatively short two month&nbsp; period. <br><br>In view of the foregoing,&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; dismissal ap- pealed from is hereby affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs. <br><br><i>Padilla, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
