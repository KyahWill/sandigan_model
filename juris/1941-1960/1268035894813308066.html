				<H3>JACINTO NOTOR, PETITIONER, VS. RAMON MARTINEZ, AS GUARDIAN OF THE INCOMPETENT, PEDRO MARTINEZ, AND THE COURT OF APPEALS, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On February 28, 1943, Pio Martinez, as guardian of Pedro 
Martinez, executed a promissory note for P2,000 in favor of Jacinto Notor, with 
interest at 10 per cent annually, and payable within two years from said date. 
In a mortgage executed on March 28, 1943, covering said note, it was furhter 
provided that the contract was "renewable at the discretion of the mortgage," 
and that the mortgagor promised to pay the sum specified in the note "according 
to the terms thereof". Due to additional sums subsequently obtained from Jacinto 
Notor, plus interest, the total indebtedness amounted as of January 29, 1945, to 
P10,111.
<p align="justify">Some time prior to this date, the guardian of pedro Martinez 
offered to pay the debt, but hte creditor Jacinto Notor refused to accept the 
payment, as a result of which the present action was instituted by the guardian 
of Pedro Martinez in the Court of First Instance of Batangas, wherein, the 
necessary amount was deposited. In the complaint (filed before the liberation of 
the Philippines), it was prayed that the debtor be declared as having fully paid 
his indebtedness to Jacinto Notor. After trial, the lower court, on August 18, 
1945, (already after liberation) rendered judgment declaring that the plaintiff, 
Ramon Martinez, as guardian of Pedro Martinez, had paid in full his indebtedness 
to the defendant, Jacinto Notor, from the time he consigned the amount thereof 
by depositing it with the clerk of court of First Instance of Batangas. From 
this judgment, Jacinto Notor appealed to the Court of Appeals which, on November 
25, 1947, rendered a decision affirming the judgemnt of the court of origin. 
From the later decision, Jacinto Notor (the petitioner) has come to this court 
in an appeal by way of certiorari. He alleges that the Court of Appeals erred in 
holding (1) that there was a valid consignation; (2) that the respondent debtor 
can pay off the mortgage within two years although the parties agreed "that this 
contract is renewable at the discretion of the mortgagee"; and (3) that the 
courts of the Commonwealth and their successors, the courts of the Philippine 
Republic, have jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p align="justify">It appearing from the stipulation of the parties that the 
defendant Jacinto Notor "admits the allegations contained in the complaint in 
sub-paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and that "the only question to be raised in the 
complaint is whether, according to the contract Exhibit A, the 
defendant-mortagee has the right to renew or not the mortgage contract at his 
discretion, as embodied in paragraph 2 of Exhibit A," the herein petitioner 
cannot now allege that there was no valid consignation. It is true that there is 
no allegation in paragraph 5 and 6 of the complaint to the effect that there was 
notice of consignation, as required by article 1177 of the Civil Code, but the 
absence of such allegation is cured by the positive stipulation that the only 
question to be raised is whether the creditor has the right to renew the 
mortgage contract at his discretion. The first assignment of error is therefore 
without merit.</p>
<p align="justify">It is the view of the herein petitioner that he has the 
absolute right to renew the term of the promissory note and accordingly refuse 
to accept payment form the debtor. It is noteworthy that hte note is payable 
wihtin two years from February 28, 1943, and that the clause providing that the 
contract is renewable at the discretion of the creditor, contains the condition 
that the debtor promises to pay according to the terms of the promissory note. 
Since at the time (prior to January 29, 1945) the promissory note in question 
was undeniably in force, the debtor had the right thereunder to pay within two 
years from February 28, 1943. The pact allowing payment within two years will be 
meaningless, if the theory of the herein petitioner were correct. At any rate, 
it is futile to speak of any renewal before the note had even matured and unless 
the debtor was unable to pay within the original term of two years. The second 
assignment of error is also untenable.</p>
<p align="justify">There can be no doubt as to the jurisdiction of the courts of 
the Commonwealth and of the Republic. In the case of Co Kim Cham vs. Valdez Tan 
Keh, 75 Phil., 113, 371; 41 Off. Gaz., 779, we have held that the judicial acts 
and proceedings of the courts of justice during the Japanese military occupation 
which are not of a political complexion, were good and valid and, by virtue of 
the principle of postliminy in international law, remained good and valid after 
the liberation of the Philippines. The litigation between the parties herein is 
certainly not of a political complexion, since it involves merely their civil 
rights, and it is immaterial whether the currency in dispute was Japanese 
military notes. At any rate, the tender of payment was made during the Japanese 
military occupation when said military notes were legal tender. Under the rules 
of Public International Law, the right of the military occupant, in the exercise 
of his governmental power, to issue military currency as legal tender has never 
been seriously questioned. (Haw Pia vs. China Banking Corporation, 80 Phil., 
604; 45 Off Gaz. (Supp. to No. 9), 229; Philippine Trust Company vs. Araneta, G.R. No. L-2734, March 17, 1949<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>). In the 
case of Haw Pia vs. China Banking Corporation, supra, we have already recognized 
the validity of a payment of a mortgage indebtedness in Japanese military notes. 
This has to be so, because "the law made by the occupant within his admitted 
power, whether morally justifiable or not will bind any member of the occupied 
population as against any other member of it, * * * as far as it produces an 
effect during the occupation." (Hilado vs. De la Costa and Philippine National 
Bank, G.R. No. L-150, April 30, 1949<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>). In the case at bar we are not 
authorizing the circulation of Japanese military notes, as legal tender at 
present, but we are merely giving effect to a payment that was valid and binding 
at the time it was made. The third assignemtn of error is likewise without 
merit.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals is 
affirmed with costs against the herein petitioner. So ordered.</p>
