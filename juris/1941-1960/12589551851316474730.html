				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Forwarded by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of Appeals,&nbsp; this lawsuit coming from Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, concerns&nbsp; a small&nbsp; parcel of land. Submitted for decision below upon a stipulation of facts, it raises legal questions only. <br><br>A portion of Lot No. 3786, Cabanatuan Cadastre (admittedly&nbsp; alienable or&nbsp; disposable&nbsp; public land way back&nbsp; in 1916)&nbsp; is covered&nbsp; by Sales Patent No. 251 issued to Margarita Juanson,&nbsp; and&nbsp; also by&nbsp; lease&nbsp; No. 49&nbsp; executed&nbsp; by the Bureau of Lands&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; Andres de Vera.&nbsp; The overlapping was&nbsp; recently&nbsp; discovered, and their&nbsp; successors in interest now litigate for possession and/or ownership.<br><br>The Sales Patent&nbsp; was&nbsp; inscribed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Register of Deeds on July&nbsp; 11,1927, and Original&nbsp; Certificate of Title&nbsp; No. 68&nbsp; was&nbsp; accordingly issued in&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of Margarita Juanson, who&nbsp; later sold the land to Remigio Juanson Bautista (1928), who in turn sold&nbsp; it to&nbsp; Balarin Incorporated&nbsp; (1929).&nbsp; In&nbsp; May 1950, Simeon T.&nbsp; Dagdag bought it from Balarin, Inc.&nbsp; After every sale, the corresponding Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title was given out.<br><br>On the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lease to De Vera signed in June 1916&nbsp; covered adjoining land of a bigger area.&nbsp; It was transferred by him to&nbsp; Regino Nepomuceno.&nbsp; Originally for a&nbsp; 25-year period&nbsp; expiring on&nbsp; June 30,&nbsp; 1941, it was&nbsp; extended for another like period in 1949.&nbsp; Dagdag's title, and those of his&nbsp; predecessors contained&nbsp; no annotation&nbsp; of such lease, of which neither he nor they had any knowledge.<br><br>After purchasing the land,&nbsp; Simeon T. Dagdag&nbsp; had it relocated&nbsp; and the portion in question&nbsp; turned out to&nbsp; be in possession of the heirs of Regino Nepomuceno, appellants&nbsp; herein allegedly by&nbsp; virtue of the lease.&nbsp; The latter refused to surrender&nbsp; it,&nbsp; even in&nbsp; the face&nbsp; of&nbsp; Dagdag's patent and&nbsp; title, and&nbsp; despite the Director of Lands' administrative determination in&nbsp; February 1953, practically holding that their contract of lease did not, could not and should&nbsp; not extend to the&nbsp; area&nbsp; granted&nbsp; to&nbsp; Dagdag's predecessors.<br><br>Hence, this&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; proceeding instituted by Dagdag in the Nueva Ecija court of first instance, wherein he&nbsp; was declared to&nbsp; be the owner of the whole Lot 3786 and entitled to the&nbsp; products thereof.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Jose N. Leuterio, Judge, explained that "the&nbsp; sales patent issued in the name of Margarita Juanson having been registered with the office of the Register of Deeds, and title having been&nbsp; issued by the Register&nbsp; of&nbsp; Deeds in the&nbsp; name of Margarita&nbsp; Juanson,&nbsp; Lot&nbsp; 3786&nbsp; was&nbsp; thereafter&nbsp; brought under the operation of the Land Registration Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title issued&nbsp; in the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Margarita Juanson, Original Certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; Title&nbsp; No. 68 was free&nbsp; from all liens&nbsp; and incumbrances. This land was transferred successively, until it was acquired&nbsp; by the plaintiff herein, and the certificate of title was issued in his name free from&nbsp; any lien or encumbrances, and free from the claim of Regino Nepomuceno&nbsp; as losses.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiffs herein cannot,&nbsp; therefore, be bound&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that Lot 3786&nbsp; is within&nbsp; the lease of Andres de&nbsp; Vera which had&nbsp; been transferred to Regino Nepomuceno, the father and predecessor of the defendants herein.&nbsp; The said lease not having been annotated on the certificate of title, and it not having been either proved or alleged that the plaintiff had purchased the land knowing that Lot 3786 is a portion of&nbsp; the land leased to Andrea de Vera which had been acquired by the defendant's predecessors-in-interest, it cannot&nbsp; prejudice the plaintiff who is presumed to be an innocent purchaser for value.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the&nbsp; lease in&nbsp; favor of Andres de Vera&nbsp; had&nbsp; been registered, cannot bind and prejudice the plaintiff for Lot 3786&nbsp; being a registered land, he need not go farther&nbsp; than the title."<br><br>The above observations deserve&nbsp; our approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; They conform with our decisions on indefeasibility of public land patents when registered in the corresponding Register&nbsp; of Deeds Office. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]&nbsp;</sup> We regard these to&nbsp; be veritable Torrens Titles&nbsp; subject to&nbsp; no&nbsp; encumbrances&nbsp; except&nbsp; those&nbsp; stated therein, plus those specified by the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; (lease&nbsp; is not one of them). <br><br>In addition to&nbsp; the above reason given by His Honor, it should be remembered that <i>when the lease was renewed in 1949,</i> the portion in question <i>was no longer public land</i> subject to the disposition of the Director of Lands because it had already been granted to&nbsp; Margarita Juanson and had become <i>private</i> property; therefore, <i>it could not have been</i> included&nbsp; in the renewal of such lease&nbsp; of public land. <br><br>Defendants' position may be summed up,&nbsp; in&nbsp; their own words, as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"When the contract of lease&nbsp; of the predecessor of the defendants was duly issued and registered in the office of the register of deeds&nbsp; of Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, and when the patent&nbsp; for the&nbsp; certificate of sale in favor of&nbsp; the predecessor of&nbsp; the plaintiff was issued&nbsp; and&nbsp; registered in the said register of deeds of Nueva Ecija, both documents&nbsp; have the force and effect of registered properties under the Land&nbsp; Registration Act as provided for in * * * (section 122 of the Land&nbsp; Registration Law). <br><br>"As&nbsp; the titles of the parties have come under the&nbsp; operation&nbsp; of the Land Registration Act, and in case of overlapping titles, the older title should prevail. The title of the defendants was issued&nbsp; and registered on June 14, 1916.&nbsp; The&nbsp; title&nbsp; of the plaintiff was registered on August&nbsp; 5, 1927.&nbsp; The <i>title of the defendants</i> should,&nbsp; therefore prevail, and they should&nbsp; have been&nbsp; declared&nbsp; the&nbsp; owners&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in&nbsp; question."&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 8-9 Appellants&nbsp; Brief)&nbsp; [Italics&nbsp; Ours]<br></blockquote>The flaw in their argument lies in the assumption that their lease contract constituted a "title", or&nbsp; deed or conveyance within the&nbsp; meaning&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 122,&nbsp; which for convenience is quoted below:<br><blockquote>"Whenever&nbsp; public&nbsp; lands in the Philippine Islands belonging to the Government of the United&nbsp; States or the Government&nbsp; of the Philippine Islands are alienated, granted, or conveyed to persons or to public&nbsp; or private corporations,&nbsp; the same shall be brought forthwith under the&nbsp; operation of this Act and shall become&nbsp; registered lands. It shall be the duty of the official issuing the instrument of alienation,&nbsp; grant,&nbsp; or conveyance in behalf of the Government to cause&nbsp; such&nbsp; instrument,&nbsp; before its&nbsp; delivery to the grantee,&nbsp; to be filed with the&nbsp; register of deeds for the&nbsp; province where the land lies and to be there registered like other deeds and conveyances, whereupon a certificate shall&nbsp; be entered&nbsp; as in other cases of&nbsp; registered land,&nbsp; and&nbsp; an&nbsp; owner's&nbsp; duplicate&nbsp; issue&nbsp; to the&nbsp; grantee.&nbsp; The deed, grant, or instrument of conveyance from the Government to the grantee shall not take effect as a conveyance or bind the land, * * *.&nbsp; After due registration&nbsp; and issue&nbsp; of the certificate and owner's&nbsp; duplicate such&nbsp; land&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; registered land for&nbsp; all purposes under this&nbsp; Act."<br></blockquote>Upon carefully reading the above, we think it clear that the documents mentioned, wherein lands&nbsp; are "alienated, granted, or&nbsp; conveyed", are documents transferring ownership—not&nbsp; documents&nbsp; of&nbsp; lease, transferring mere possession.&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe especially that&nbsp; the statute directs the issuance to the grantee of&nbsp; "an owner's duplicate certificate". Appellants may not, therefore, assert a title just as good—so they&nbsp; claim—as appellee's and older besides.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the Torrens Title&nbsp; of appellee must prevail.<br><br>Judgment affirmed,&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against appellants.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,&nbsp; C.
