				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In a&nbsp; direct appeal&nbsp; to&nbsp; this Court, Jaime L.&nbsp; Porta prays for the reversal of the&nbsp; decision of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Iloilo,&nbsp; in its Civil Case No. 1599,&nbsp; setting aside as fictitious the P30,000&nbsp; mortgage on&nbsp; seventeen (17)&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of&nbsp; registered&nbsp; land&nbsp; in Sta. Barbara and San Miguel, Iloilo,&nbsp; valued&nbsp; at P80,000, executed in&nbsp; his&nbsp; favor&nbsp; by&nbsp; the late&nbsp; Dr, Mariano&nbsp; B. Arroyo, as mortgagor,&nbsp; on July 3, 1939; annulling the judicial proceedings had in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 11630 of Iloilo for&nbsp; foreclosure of the aforesaid mortgage, including the judgment&nbsp; of foreclosure and the&nbsp; sale thereunder&nbsp; of the mortgaged&nbsp; properties&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; the mortgagee Porta, for having&nbsp; been obtained by fraud and collusion, and ordering&nbsp; the cancellation of the mortgage in question.<br><br>The appealed judgment was rendered by Judge Querube Makalintal&nbsp; (now of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals), upon suit&nbsp; filed on June 28, 1949, by Dr. Arroyo's widow, Dolores Vasquez de Arroyo, both in&nbsp; her&nbsp; own&nbsp; behalf&nbsp; and as&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; administratrix of her husband's&nbsp; estate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Judge made a thorough and exhaustive study of the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and his findings are to the effect that the mortgage was simulated and fictitious, and that the foreclosure suit, judgment, and sale&nbsp; (which was never judicially&nbsp; confirmed), were the result of a connivance between the mortgagor Dr. Arroyo, and mortgagee Jaime L. Porta&nbsp; (appellant herein).<br><br>It is not controverted that appellee Dolores Vasquez had obtained against her husband Mariano B. Arroyo a judgment&nbsp; for separate&nbsp; maintenance&nbsp; at P500 a month.&nbsp; Dr. Arroyo repeatedly sought to evade fulfilling the judgment by simulated sales&nbsp; of his properties,&nbsp; two of which&nbsp; were finally set aside by the Courts1 before the last war.&nbsp; Later, in 1938,&nbsp; the husband attempted to make a simulated sale of the very properties&nbsp; here in&nbsp; question&nbsp; in favor of his step-mother Dña. Trinidad Vda. de Arroyo,&nbsp; but the latter refused to accept the simulated&nbsp; conveyance (Exhibit Z).<br><br>The evidence now before us fully supports the findings of the trial Court&nbsp; that, after&nbsp; the&nbsp; rebuff from&nbsp; his&nbsp; stepmother, the late Dr. Arroyo persisted in his plan of fictitiously encumbering his properties to defeat the judgment in favor of his&nbsp; wife, appellee herein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence on July&nbsp; 3, 1939,&nbsp; he executed a second mortgage&nbsp; (Exhibit F) on the lands&nbsp; in question in favor of appellant Jaime L. Porta, and ratified it&nbsp; before.&nbsp; Notary&nbsp; Public&nbsp; Advincula, whose office&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; the same room&nbsp; as Arroyo's lawyer,&nbsp; Jose G. Ganzon.&nbsp; The consideration recited&nbsp; was P30,000, and receipt thereof&nbsp; was&nbsp; acknowledged; but no money&nbsp; was paid over when&nbsp; the mortgage was signed.&nbsp; At that&nbsp; time, on the contrary, the mortgagor remarked&nbsp; to Advincula, in appellant's presence&nbsp; that the recited&nbsp; P30,000 "did not exist."&nbsp; Appellant said nothing against this&nbsp; manifestation. The testimony&nbsp; of Attorney Advincula&nbsp; and stenographer Figueroa is corroborated to the fact that on the day the mortgage deed was signed the balance, of Porta's banking account stood at only P326.03;&nbsp; and the first mortgage&nbsp; in favor of the National Bank was never&nbsp; paid.&nbsp; Porta's explanation that the price was paid in installments between April&nbsp; and September 1939 is contradicted by the mortgage deed and the deposition of witness Ligio Gramonte (Exhibit 20),.<br><br>It appears also that&nbsp; the foreclosure&nbsp; complaint (Civil Case No. 11630)&nbsp; was filed on October 11, 1939, only three months after the execution&nbsp; of the mortgage deed;&nbsp; yet according to the&nbsp; tenor of the contract the debt was payable in five (5)&nbsp; years, i.e., on&nbsp; July of 1944.&nbsp;&nbsp; The alleged default of&nbsp; the mortgagor in the payment of&nbsp; quarterly interest&nbsp; since&nbsp; April 1939,is contradicted&nbsp; by&nbsp; Porta's&nbsp; own testimony that the P30,000 was not fully delivered to&nbsp; the mortgagor&nbsp; until September of 1939, only one month before the suit. To cap it all, the complaint, according; to Advincula and Figueroa, was prepared in the office of Arroyo's own Attorney, Ganzon, though signed by Porta's&nbsp; lawyer, Cabaluna (who did not testify); and these witnesses&nbsp; are confirmed on this point&nbsp; by the subsequent finding of an unsigned copy of the complaint of foreclosure (Exhibit G—1), among the&nbsp; papers&nbsp; that Arroyo left at his demise.<br><br>Summoned on October 17,&nbsp; 1939,&nbsp; Arroyo answered just four days later, with a simple general denial.&nbsp; Thereupon on October 27, 1939,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Porta's lawyer moved&nbsp; for judgment on the pleadings, and with the assent of Arroyo's counsel, judgment was rendered, as prayed for, on October 31,&nbsp; 1939.&nbsp;&nbsp; Execution was issued in 1940; the foreclosure sale was had, and the certificate of sale in favor of&nbsp; the mortgagee&nbsp; was issued&nbsp; on January 18, 1941 (Exhibit&nbsp; L); but no order confirming the sale is of record, though&nbsp; the defendant's file of the proceedings appears otherwise complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; prior to the&nbsp; execution&nbsp; and sale,&nbsp;&nbsp; the appellant Porta appears&nbsp; to have executed a <i> cancellation</i> of the&nbsp; mortgage debt,&nbsp; dated December 1939&nbsp; (long before the foreclosure sale);&nbsp; and the signed copy of this cancellation, though not notarized, was found by the widow among the papers of her late husband (Exhibit K). This explains why Arroyo continued possessing as owner the mortgaged properties,&nbsp; even after their sale to Porta; he leased them to one&nbsp; Miguel Cupang in 1945, and in 1947 sold them to Tirso Jamandre for P80,000&nbsp; (Exhibit Q),&nbsp; altho this&nbsp; sale was cancelled in 1948 by&nbsp; agreement between&nbsp; Jamandre and Arroyo's widow.<br><br>In view of these facts, the Court below correctly&nbsp; concluded :<br><blockquote>"By direct testimony of witnesses,&nbsp; by the undeniable&nbsp; implications of the&nbsp; documents presented by the plaintiff and&nbsp; by&nbsp; the logical import of events and of the actuations of the parties to the mortgage, the&nbsp; proof of its fraudulent and simulated character is overwhelming. It was executed on July 3, 1939, for a term of five years. Less than four months thereafter it was foreclosed for alleged non-payment of interest.&nbsp; Judgment&nbsp; was confessed by the&nbsp; mortgagor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mortgagee,&nbsp; who seemed&nbsp; to&nbsp; be in such a hurry to protect&nbsp; his rights, thereafter lost all interest and allowed the mortgaged properties to remain&nbsp; in the possession of the mortgagor, for him to do with&nbsp; them as he pleased—leasing them, getting all their fruits, filing a war claim in&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to the products taken by the army&nbsp; during the occupation, all in his name and for his benefit without the least intervention on the part of the mortgagee to whom the said properties had already been ostensibly sold."&nbsp; (Rec. App. 60-61.)<br></blockquote>It is thus incontestable that the mortgage&nbsp; in favor of appellant Porta was simulated, fictitious and&nbsp; without&nbsp; consideration ; and that&nbsp; the foreclosure proceedings in Case No. 11630, the judgment and the&nbsp; sale of the supposedly mortgaged properties were the result of collusion and&nbsp; connivance between Arroyo and appellant Porta.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of foreclosure in said&nbsp; case can&nbsp; not constitute res jiidicata nor be a valid defense&nbsp; to&nbsp; an action to set&nbsp; aside the judgment (Kule 123, section&nbsp; 45; Almeda <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Cruz,&nbsp; 47 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 1179, 84&nbsp; Phil., 636;&nbsp; Anuran <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Aquino,&nbsp; 38 Phil., 89; Garchitorena <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Sotelo, 74&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 25).<br><br>The appellant&nbsp; asserts&nbsp; that&nbsp; the appellee,&nbsp; Dolores Vasquez,&nbsp; as administratrix&nbsp; and&nbsp; representative&nbsp; of the&nbsp; late Mariano Arroyo,&nbsp; can&nbsp; not&nbsp; now impugn the fraudulent transactions of her husband; but in&nbsp; so doing the defense loses sight of the fact that the mortgage and sale in favor of appellant Jaime L. Porta were fictitious, simulated&nbsp; and without&nbsp; consideration.&nbsp; They were,&nbsp; therefore, not&nbsp; merely voidable but totally void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio,</span>&nbsp; and inexistent in&nbsp; law. Consequently,&nbsp; the lands .involved&nbsp; remained, the property of&nbsp; the late&nbsp; Dr. Arroyo as Porta himself&nbsp; ostensibly acknowledged by his inertia in allowing the doctor to exercise dominical power thereon without any protest on his part. Wherefore, as&nbsp; administratrix of Arroyo's&nbsp; estate and as liquidator&nbsp; of the conjugal partnership,&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; Vasquea had the right to sue for the recovery&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; lands, in consonance with her duty to marshall his assets&nbsp; (Rule 88, section 2; Rule&nbsp; 75, section 2).<br><br>The&nbsp; principle "<i>in pari delicto non oritur actio</i>"&nbsp; does not apply to bar appellee's action: first,&nbsp; because she&nbsp; sued not only as administratrix of the deceased, but also in her own behalf;&nbsp; secondly, because the maxim applies only in case of existing contracts with illegal consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Articles 1S05, 1306, Civil&nbsp; Code of 1889; Articles 1411 and 1412, new Civil Code)&nbsp; and is not applicable to simulated or fictitious contracts nor to those that are inexistent for lack of an essential requisite (consideration in this case). The fact that&nbsp; the&nbsp; collusive&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; between Arroyo and Porta had the illegal purpose of defrauding Arroyo's wife does&nbsp; not bring the case within the purview of the maxim and the&nbsp; articles mentioned, since an illegal purpose can not supply the want of consideration that renders the contract inexistent (Gonzales <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Trinidad, 67 Phi},, 682).<br><br>While the&nbsp; appellee Dolores Vasquez agreed in 1940&nbsp; to&nbsp; a liquidation of her conjugal partnership with Mariano Arroyo and relinquished all her claims to the seventeen&nbsp; parcels of&nbsp; land now in question, in consideration of the&nbsp; sum of F15.000, payment of which was guaranteed by appellant Porta but has not been&nbsp; fully paid so far, it is clear&nbsp; that she did so in the erroneous belief&nbsp; that&nbsp; the mortgage to Porta was a valid and subsistent transaction.&nbsp; Not having knowledge of the true&nbsp; facts, her assent can not constitute confirmation or ratification,&nbsp; specially&nbsp; because&nbsp; only voidable contracts can be validly confirmed or ratified, inexistent contracts not being susceptible of confirmation or ratification (old Civil Code, Article&nbsp; 1309, 1311; new Civil Code, Articles 1S92, 1393 and 1409, last paragraph).<br><br>Anent the defense of prescription, suffice it to say that, even under the prior legislation (Act 190), the statute of limitations&nbsp; only commenced to run against the&nbsp; appellee from the time of her discovery of&nbsp; the fraudulent&nbsp; maneuvers of which she was a victim; and she had no inkling of them until 1948, when her husband died and she found among his&nbsp; papers Porta's cancellation&nbsp; of the mortgage in his favor, and the draft of the complaint for foreclosure. Having initiated these proceedings in 1949, the four year limitation&nbsp; from the&nbsp; discovery of the&nbsp; fraud had not yet elapsed, and her action was not extinguished or barred.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed.&nbsp; Appellant, Jaime L. Porta, will pay the costs in both instances. So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.
