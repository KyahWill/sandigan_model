				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Involving about P2,000.00 only, this suit is here because appellant announced 
in the court below her intention to raise points or questions of law before this 
Court.<p></p>
<p>She sued Leander Almiñe and his parents seeking to recover damages for his 
breach of promise of marriage. She alleged that relying on his pledges of 
sincere love and of matrimony, she allowed the said Leander the privileges of a 
husband, as a result of which she gave birth to a baby boy, but without any 
reason whatsoever, he refused to fulfill his promise; and that his parents in 
various ways helped him accomplish his deceitful purposes, yet they would not 
make compensation for his wrongful behaviour. Hence, she asked for damages which 
she specified, and for other relief.</p>
<p>Witnesses testified, and documentary evidence -mainly the letters of 
defendant Leander - was introduced. However, the judge presiding the court of 
first instance of Masbate held that although carnal relations had been proven, 
the evidence showed no n promise on the part of the defendant Leander Almiñe to 
marry the herein plaintiff." Consequently, he dismissed the case and this appeal 
followed.</p>
<p>The letters and the transcript of the stenographic notes are attached to the 
record before us. The plaintiff's brief insists that the testimonial and 
documentary evidence sufficiently established a promise of marriage. Indeed, the 
love-letter Exh. A says in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In my vision I hold you and me kneeling and praying before priest infront of 
the altar swearing to be true to each other until death separates 
us."</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet the question whether promises had been made is one of fact, for the Court 
of Appeals to decide in view of the amount involved.</p>
<p>There is of course the rule (Sec. 3, Rule 42) that where the appellant states 
in his notice of appeal that it "is based purely on questions of law", no other 
question shall be allowed, such statement being construed as a waiver of all 
questions of fact.<span class="style1"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span> </sup></span>Herein plaintiff's 
notice of appeal said she was "appealing the decision" to the Supreme Court "on 
points or questions of law." This statement could mean either "appeal <u>purely</u> on 
questions of law" or "appeal <u>mainly</u> on questions of law." It could also imply 
the plaintiff's impression that whenever questions of law are raised, the appeal 
should be carried directly to the Supreme Court - even if questions of fact are 
also involved.</p>
<p>As this is a pauper's litigation<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> and 
as appellee objected not to the consideration of the factual issue raised by 
appellant, we deem it more consistent with the interests of justice not to 
preclude revision of the evidence.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the record will be referred to the Court of Appeals for 
adjudication according to law.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Montemayor, 
Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L., Endencia,</i> 
and<i> Felix, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br>
