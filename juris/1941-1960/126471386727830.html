				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an action instituted by plaintiff to eject the defendants from two parcels of land situated north of Espa√±a Extension and  east of an imaginary line  extending northward from the intersection  of said street and Cordillera Street, Quezon  City, and to collect the rental value thereof. Defendants deny plaintiff's title to said  lands and  allege open, public, notorious and  continuous possession thereof under claim of ownership from time immemorial.  They further claim that if plaintiff has a registered title thereto, the same was secured through collusion with public officials and in fraud of defendants.  By way of counterclaim they pray that plaintiff be required to reconvey the lands to them or otherwise pay them the sum of P500,000, value of the property.</p>
<p>There is no  question  that the lands  are  within the big parcel originally registered on July 8,  1914 in G.L.R.O. Record No. 7681  under Original  Certificate of Title No. 735.  The survey of the big  parcel took place in 1910 and 1911 and  registration  proceedings began in  September, 1911 (see Exh. "5").  The  lands in question ,are now included in a parcel registered in the name  of plaintiff J. M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc.,  a corporation, under  transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267  (37687) of the Office of the Register  of Deeds of Rizal (Exhs. "A"  and  "B").  Plaintiff is the owner of the lands,  having obtained title thereto by purchase from the heirs of D. Tuason,  Inc. (Exh. "E"). The evidence shows that about forty or  more years ago, one Florencio Sanchez, father of defendant Lucia Sanchez, had been occupying both parcels of land, planting the bigger parcel  to rice and corn and the smaller one to sweet potatoes and  vegetables,  personally and  through  the help of tenants.  Upon  the death of Florencio Sanchez in 1919 Toribio Arrinquin cultivated the bigger land for Lucia Sanchez with  the assistance  of  Carlos  Javier.  Upon Toribio's death,  Javier  continued  the  cultivation.  Both Toribio and Javier were tenants of Lucia Sanchez and shared the products with her.</p>
<p>In 1940  Lucia Sanchez was  asked to declare the  land for tax purposes and she did so  (Exh. "3").  But  her own tax declaration contained the note that it was a duplicate of and included  in Tax Declaration No. 764  in  the name of J.  M.  Tuason.   While Lucia claims to have paid taxes on the land, no tax receipt  was produced by her. In the year 1948 people began  to  construct their houses on the land, some with Lucia's permission, other without permission at all. Lucia collected rentals from those who were willing.   Rentals were from P2 up per house.</p>
<p>It is important to  note that defendants  did  not prove in what concept Lucia Sanchez's father had been occupying and cultivating the lands subject of the action. Neither was there  any  pretense that her occupation was adverse against the Tuasons or the whole world, except that Lucia, in the course of her testimony, said she attends to the land because she is the owner (t. s. n. Lerma, p. 30).  She made this statement when  it was  disclosed  that  she  has  a brother, who has made no  claim to the  land.  On  the other hand, plaintiff  sought to  prove by the testimonies of Domingo Ramos and Policarpio  de Jesus that Lucia's father,  one by  the name of Sisong Paud,  had been paying rentals to the Tuason family; that he died after the first world war,  and that upon his death his son continued  cultivating the land. The above witnesses showed they knew the land and the deceased father  of Lucia Sanchez  and knew the character of  the land  in  the neighborhood  and knew them to be  lands of the Tuasons to whom occupants paid rentals.</p>
<p>A consideration of the facts  proved leads to the conclusion  that Lucia Sanchez and  her father must have occupied and cultivated the land paying nominal rentals to the owners of the land, the Tuason family, or merely by sufferance of the latter.   We note that the lands were not used by defendants for building their houses on.  Only temporary houses were  built thereon for the  tillers  of the soil.</p>
<p>The trial court correctly declared plaintiff owner of the lands and dismissed  defendant's  claim  of ownership  of the lands and their prayer for reconveyance.  Plaintiff has a title thereto, which defendants have  not been able  to contest.  No evidence was submitted to show that defendants ever  occupied the  lands  as owners,  and  adversely against the registered owners.   But its award of damages in the sum of P72,000 and Pl,800 are not justified.  P72,000 represents the interest that the owner would have realized, if the lands were converted into  a subdivision and sold. There no competent  evidence introduced that the said land could have been  sold at the  price fixed  or that buyers would have paid or could have paid said price.  We hold that the damages are speculative.  P1,800 was fixed as  the  sum received by Lucia Sanchez from  squatters. But Lucia  Sanchez  herself  testified,  on being called  as witness  for plaintiff,  that many  of the  squatters who constructed their houses did not pay, or if they paid in the beginning, failed to pay later on.  All she admitted was P30 a month in  1949 and  P50 in 1950  (t. s.  n. Duque, p. 15) or a total of P960 for two years.  For subsequent years, she refused to state how much she  collected.   This notwithstanding,   the  amount   could  have  been around P500.  The sum  of Pl,800 awarded as damages should, therefore,  be reduced to P1,500.</p>
<p>The claim of defendants-appellants that plaintiff is not entitled to bring the action because Gregorio Araneta, Inc. is entrusted with the management of the land is without merit. The action is to  quiet  title and for ejectment, and the party entitled to bring it  is the owner, which is the plaintiff.  The other claims are so obviously  unfounded as to merit any consideration at all.</p>
<p>The judgment is modified insofar as the award of damages  is concerned.  The award  of P72,000 is hereby set aside and that of P1,800 reduced to P1,500.   In all other respects the judgment is  affirmed, with costs against defendants-appellants.</p>
