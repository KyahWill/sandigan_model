				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On 28 March 1941, Walter E. Hicks, then a resident of Manila, and the  Philippine Trust  Company,  a  domestic corporation, entered into a trust agreement whereby,  for and in consideration of the trust assumed by  the trustee, the Philippine Trust Company, as well as of  the sum of PI paid by the grantor, Walter E. Hicks, to and received by the trustee, the grantor granted, bargained,  sold,  assigned, transferred and set over, and by the trust agreement did grant, bargain,  sell, assign, transfer and set over unto the trustee, its successors and assigns the properties therein enumerated and described.  The trustee  accepted and  entered upon the administration  of the trust as stipulated in the trust agreement.  On 8 December 1941 the Pacific war broke out.   Walter E. Hicks became incompetent and  the People's Bank and Trust Company was appointed  guardian of the estate of the incompetent.  On 4  September 1947, the Court approved the action of the guardian in advising the Philippine Trust Company, as trustee, of the revocation of the trust and ordered the latter to turn over to the guardian the remaining assets of the incompetent after deducting the stipulated compensation.  On 23 October  1947, the Philippine  Trust  Company, as trustee, turned over to  the People's Bank and Trust Company,  as guardian, corporate shares and bank deposits which were held by the defendant, as trustee, in compliance with the order of 4 September 1947.  On  11 May  1949, John D. Singleton was appointed guardian of the  estate of the incompetent in lieu of  the People's Bank and  Trust Company  in Special  Proceedings No. 59253 of the Court of First Instance of Manila. After his appointment  he inquired  into  the assets  of the incompetent and discovered that the trustee, Philippine Trust Company, had failed to turn over to the former guardian, the  People's  Bank and  Trust  Company, the   sum of P44,286.27,  representing a balance  as of  31 October 1941 belonging to the estate of the incompetent in possession of the trustee under the trust agreement at the  outbreak of the war on  8 December 1941.  Demand was  made by the present and former guardians of the estate of the incompetent for the delivery of the said trust fund but the trustee failed, neglected  and refused  to pay any or  part of said  amount alleging as  excuse therefor that the  said trust  fund had been transferred to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd.,  on 29 September 1944, in obedience to the order of the Japanese Military  Administration, "ZAI"  No.  257, promulgated  on 4 October  1943.  In  truth  and in fact, however, the amount allegedly  transferred by the trustee to the Bank  of Taiwan, Ltd. on 29 September  1944  was entirely different from and  unrelated to  the cash funds amounting to P44,286.27 held by the defendant on  December 1941 in trust  for the estate  of the incompetent and for which the trustee is  accountable under the law and terms of the trust  agreement  of  28  March 1941.   Stripped of arguments and conclusions, these are the substantial facts pleaded in the complaint filed on 2 February 1950 by John D. Singleton, as guardian of the estate of the incompetent Walter E. Hicks against the  Philippine Trust Company as trustee.   The plaintiff prayed that after hearing  judgment be rendered ordering the defendant to pay to him, as guardian of the estate of the incompetent Walter E. Hicks, the sum of  P44,286.27, together with lawful  interest thereon from  31  October  1941 to the date of payment, and costs. He also prayed for such  other  and further relief  as  law, equity and justice may warrant.</p>
<p>On  15 January 1951 Walter E. Hicks was declared competent by the Superior Court of the State of California, in and  for the County  of  Los Angeles,' and arrived in Manila on 2 July 1951.   Upon motion of the guardian the guardianship  in  the  Manila Court was  terminated, the guardian discharged and the incompetent released from guardianship on  6 August 1951 (Special  Proceedings No. 59253, Court of  First Instance of  Manila).</p>
<p>In  its answer the defendant admits and denies certain facts  pleaded in the complaint and alleges that on  23 October  1947 it turned  over to  the People's Bank and Trust Company, as guardian of the incompetent, all the remaining assets in full  compliance with the aforesaid order of the probate court of 4 September 1947;  that the former guardian, the People's Bank and Trust Company, knew that the sum of P44,286.27 sought to be  recovered by the plaintiff had been transferred to  the Bank of Taiwan,  Ltd.  by order of the Japanese Military Administration on 29  September 1944 and denies specifically the allegation of the plaintiff that the money allegedly transferred by the trustee to the Bank of  Taiwan, Ltd. on 29 September 1944 was entirely  different from and unrelated to  the  sum  of P44,286.27 held by the defendant on December 1941 allegedly in  trust for the estate of the said incompetent Walter E. Hicks, as set forth by the plaintiff in paragraph 7 of his complaint.   As affirmative defenses and  counterclaim the defendant alleges  that in accordance with the  trust agreement it, as trustiee, deposited on 10 January  1941 the cash fund in question in a current  account with the  Philippine Trust Company, a commercial bank, in the name of "W. E. Hicks, Trust No. 1098; that the former guardian of the estate  of the incompetent  Walter E. Hicks, the People's Bank and Trust Company,  had knowledge of and did not object to said current  account deposit;  that  on 4 October 1943 the Director of the Department ot General Affairs of the Japanese Military Administration in the Philippines promulgated "ZAI"  No. 257 ordering all deposit  accounts of hostile people  (including that of W.  E. Hicks, Trust No. 1098) to be transferred to the  Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., as depositary of the Bureau of Enemy Custody; that on or about 2 March 1944 the defendant  bank was ordered by  the  Japanese Military Administration to open and transact business and  on  29 September 1944 it was compelled to transfer  and turn over to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., pursuant to "ZAI" No. 257, all deposit accounts of hostile  people including that of W. E. Hicks, Trust No. 1098, and that in compliance with the said order the defendant turned over to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. the aforesaid balance of current acount in the  name of "W. E. Hicks, Trust No. 1098;" that on 28 September 1949 the Philippine Trust Company received a letter from the guardian of the estate of Walter E. Hicks requesting the remittance of the sum of P44,286.27; that in reply to said letter, on 8 October 1949 the  Philippine Trust Company by its counsel wrote a letter informing the  guardian  of the decision of the Supreme Court in Everett Steamship Corporation <em>vs.</em> Bank of the Philippine Islands, 47 Off. Gaz. 165, which released  the Philippine Trust  Company from any obligation or  responsibility to Walter E. Hicks regarding the said sum; and that  in spite of said  information about the decision of the Supreme Court in the said case, the plaintiff brought this frivolous action against the defendant causing the latter damage in the sum of P5,000.  It prayed that the complaint be dismissed and the plaintiff be ordered to pay the defendant the sum of P5,000 as damages, and costs.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the filing of the complaint it came to the knowledge of the plaintiff that there  was another sum of P5,090.06 accountable by the defendant and due to the plaintiff.  So  on 6 October 1951 the plaintiff sought to amend his complaint to plead another cause of action for the recovery from the  defendant of the sum of P5,090.06, but the motion for allowance of  an  amended  complaint was denied on 5  November  1951.</p>
<p>On 14 December 1951 the defendant  moved for a summary judgment on the  ground that on 29 July 1949 the plaintiff, in his capacity as guardian  of the estate of the incompetent Walter E. Hicks, filed a notice of claim for payment of debt with the Philippine Alien Property Administration and swore that the claim for the sum of P44,286.27 was the cash balance of the deposit in the name of Walter E. Hicks in the Philippine Trust Company and transferred to the Bank of  Taiwan, Ltd. on 29 September 1944 by order of the Japanese Military Administration; that for that reason the Philippine Trust Company  had denied responsibility for such amount transferred to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., and that the claim was filed because Walter E. Hicks had no recourse against the Philippine Trust Company.  He further swore that in compliance with the order of the probate court on 23 October 1947, the Philippine Trust Company transferred all the assets of Walter E. Hicks to the People's  Bank  and Trust Company, the guardian  of the estate of the incompetent Walter E. Hicks, except the cash balance of  P44,286,27, and that the defendant disclaimed any  responsibility for it because of the transfer made of said sum or cash balance to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. In the motion for summary judgment the defendant contended that the admission  made by the guardian was binding upon the ward and that in view of the admission, except as to the amount of damages sought to be recovered by the defendant in its counterclaim, there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and for that reason prayed for such judgment to which it was entitled as a matter of law, dismissing the plaintiffs complaint with costs.  Despite objection of the plaintiff to the motion for summary judgment, as set out in his pleading of 26 January 1952 and of 8  February 1952  attaching thereto  an affidavit executed by John D. Singleton on 31 January 1952, wherein he swore that all the facts stated in the claim filed by him, in his capacity as  guardian  of  the estate  of the  incompetent Walter E. Hicks, with the Philippine Alien Properly Administration, had been obtained and secured from the defendant  Philippine Trust  Company,  and of several other pleadings to the same effect,  on 10 March 1952 the Court entered an order granting the motion  for summary judgment and dismissing the plaintiff's complaint without costs. The  defendant's counterclaim also was dismissed.   Motion to set aside the judgment  was denied.  Hence this  appeal. The  Court of Appeals certified the case to  this Court on the grcfund  that only questions of law are raised.</p>
<p>The appellant assigns as error the denial by the Court below of a motion to allow an amended complaint so as to include a second cause  of action for the recovery of the sum of F5,090.06 which the  plaintiff learned was  due to the estate of the incompetent Walter E. Hicks only after the filing of the complaint.  We cannot pass upon this alleged error because from such denial no appeal has been taken by the  plaintiff. </p>
<p>Section 2, Rule 36, provides</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A party against whom a claim, counterclaim,  or  cross claim is asserted  or a declaratory relief is sought may, at any time, move with supporting affidavits for a summary judgment is his favor as  to all or any part thereof. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 3 of the same Rule provides—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* *  *  The judgment sought  shall be rendered forthwith if  the pleadings, depositions,  and admissions on file, together with  the  affidavits, show that, except as to  the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue  as  to  any  material  fact and  that the moving party  is entitled to a judgment as a mutter  of law. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last quoted provisions which  give courts'  authority to grant relief by summary  judgment  are intended  to expedite or promptly dispose  of cases where the facts appear  undisputed  and certain from the pleadings,  depositions,  admissions and  affidavits.  But if there be a  doubt as to  such facts and there  be an issue  or issues of fact joined  by the parties neither  one of them  can pray for a summary  judgment.   Where the facts  pleaded  by the  parties are  disputed or contested proceedings for  a  summary  judgment cannot take the place of a trial.   For  that  reason  section  5 prescribes  and  requires that "supporting and  opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge,  shall  set forth  such  facts  as would  be admissible  in  evidence,  and shall  show  affirmatively that the affiant is  competent to testify to the  matters stated therein."   Depositions  and  affidavits  are those supporting  o?  denying the  facts stated in the pleadings  by the parties to an  action, and  from  which  it may  clearly  be drawn  that  certain  facts pleaded by either party are certain, undisputed and indubitable which dispense with the hearing or trial of the  case.  Admissions that may be availed of to pray for a  summary judgment are those  made  in pleadings  filed  by the parties or made by a party to an action, as provided for  in Rule 23.  The fact stated in the sworn declaration executed by the guardian of the incompetent to support his claim filed with the Philippine Alien Property Administration that the cash balance of P44,286.27 of the deposit in the name of Walter E. Hicks  in the Philippine Trust Company was transferred to the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd., on 29  September 1944 by order of the Japanese Military Administration is neither an admission on nle referred to in section 3, Rule 36, nor an affidavit  contemplated in section 5 of the same Rule, because the facts stated therein were not made on personal knowledge but were obtained, secured or derived from the defendant itself and the facts stated therein being  hearsay the affiant is not competent  to testify to such facts.  The affidavit of John D. Singleton of 31  January 1952 attached to the plaintiff's pleading of 8  February 1952 shows that the facts stated in the claim filed by him with the Philippine Alien Property Administration had been obtained from the defendant.  And this must be true because all such  facts  were only known to the officer of the defendant in charge of those transfers or the officer of the receiving bank, the Bank of Taiwan, Ltd. Aside from what  has just been stated, paragraph  7 of the complaint  alleges—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That in truth and in fact, the money allegedly transferred by defendant to the Bank of Taiwan,  Ltd. on  September 29, 1944 was entirely different from  and unrelated to the cash funds  amounting to P44,286.27 held by the defendant on December, 1941 in trust for the estate of said Walter E. Hicks and for which  it is still accountable under the law and the terms of  the aforesaid Trust Agreement of March  28,  1941  (p.  4, record on appeal.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allegation at least raises a cloud and creates a doubt on or as to the certainty of the transfer by the defendant to the Bank  of  Taiwan, Ltd.  of  the  cash balance  of P44,286.27 of the deposit in the name of Walter E. Hicks— a  cloud and doubt  which  withdraw the case from  the the operation of Rule 36 and must be removed and cleared by holding a  trial of the case.</p>
<p>The summary judgment rendered by  the trial  court at the instance and upon motion of the defendant is erroneous under the provisions of Rule 36 providing for entrepot summary judgments. </p>
<p>The judgment appealed  from is set aside and the case remanded  to the trial  court for further proceedings  in accordance with law, with costs against the appellee.</p>
