and plotted the liquidation of acting and elected government officials, to 
create and spread chaos, disorder, terror, and fear so as to facilitate the 
accomplishment of the aforesaid purpose, among which are a* follows, to wit:</p>
<p>"(1) On May 6, 1946, the 10th MP Co., led by First Lt. Mamerto Lorenzo, while 
on patrol duty in barrio Santa Monica, Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, was with evident 
premeditation, ambushed and treacherously attacked by a band of well-armed Huks. 
Ten enlisted men of the MP Company were killed and First Lt. Mamerto Lorenzo was 
captured and beheaded by the rebels.</p>
<p>"(2) On August 6, 1946, a group of more than 30 Huks under the leadership of

Stalin, Commander of Joint Forces No. 108, with about 108 men, entered the town

hours. The municipal officials did not offer any resistance because of the 
superiority in number of the Huks. After demanding from the civilians foodstuffs 
such as rice, chickens, goats, and carabaos, they left the town, admonishing the 
civilians always to support the Huk organization. The MP forces under Capt. 
Ponciano Halili, S-3, Capt. Federico G. Olares, then Assistant S-3 of Nueva 
Ecija province, proceeded to Pantabangan with forces of the 112th MP Co. under 
Capt Nicanor Garcia, to verify the information, but were not able to contact the 
dissidents at Pantabangan. They proceeded to barrio Marikit, between Pantabangan 
and Laur, where they engaged some dissidents. When our forces were on their way 
home, they were pocketed by the dissidents at the zigzag road, but our forces

casualties.</p>

machine guns, and grenades. Lt. Pablo Cruz and Pvt. Santiago Mercado were killed 
and six other were wounded.</p>

the rendition of the decision appealed from are set forth therein in the 
following language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The prosecution having reamended the information filed in this case, in 
compliance with the order of this Court of August 18, 1954, the defendant Luis 
M. Taruc again appeared this morning with his counsel, for arraignment. When 
asked if the defendant was ready to be arraigned, defense counsel answered in 
the affirmative and at the same time manifested that if counts 1 to 6, 
inclusive, as well as count 8, were suppressed from the amended information, the 
defendant would plead guilty. After securing assurance from defendant himself, 
the City Fiscal filed the corresponding petition, suppressing from the amended 
information the counts referred to, that is, counts 1 to 6, inclusive, and 8. 
Thereupon, the defendant waived the reading of the information as lastly 
amended, and manifested that he was already informed of the contents of the 
same, and that he pleaded guilty thereto." (CFI Decision, 1st 
Par.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Thereupon, the Court of First Instance of Manila, presided over by Hon. 
Gregorio Narvasa, Judge, rendered the decision aforementioned, from which the 
Government has appealed. The questions raised for our determination are:</p>
<p>1. May the prosecution appeal from the aforesaid decision of the lower court, 
upon the ground that defendant-appellee Luis Taruc should have been sentenced to 
a more severe penalty than that meted out therein?</p>
<p>2. In the affirmative case, what penalty should be imposed upon said 
defendant-appellee?</p>
<p>The first question has already been settled by this Court in cases G. R. Nos. 
L-6687-6688 entitled People vs. Ang Cho Kio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup>" The defendant in said cases was charged 
with murder, in one case, and with grave coercion with murder, in another case. 
Having pleaded guilty to both charges, the lower court sentenced him, in the 
first case, to an indeterminate penalty ranging from 12 years of <em>prision 
mayor</em> to 20 years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, to indemnify the heirs of 
the deceased in the sum of P6,000, and to pay the costs; and, in the second 
case, to life imprisonment, with indemnity in the sum of P6,000 and costs. The 
prosecution appealed from the decision thus rendered, upon the theory that the 
defendant should have been sentenced, in the first case, to life imprisonment 
and, in the second case, to the extreme penalty. In dismissing the appeal, we 
asid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"?Puede el ministerio fiscal apelar?</p>
<p>"El articulo 2 de la Regla 118 dice asi:</p>
<p>'<em>Quien puede apelar</em>.—El Pueblo de Filipinas, sin embargo, no podra 
apelar cuando el acusado se viese expuesto a doble <em>Jeopardy</em>. En todos 
los demas casos, cualquiera de las partes podra apelar de una sentencia 
definitiva o de auto dictado despues de la sentencia que afecte los derechos 
esenciales del apelante.'</p>
<p>"Este articulo es reproduction de los articulos 43 y 44 de la Orden General 
No. 58 tal como fue emendada por el articulo 4 de la Ley No. 2886. La Orden 
General No. 58 es de origen americano y, por eso, los precedentes 
anglo-americanos deben tenerse muy en cuenta.</p>
<p>"En una larga lista de decisiones despues de decidida en casacion la causa de 
Kepner contra Estados Unidos, 195 U. S. 100; 11 Jur. Fil., 689, se ha 
establecido invariablemente por este Tribunal la doctrina de que ,1a acusacion 
no puede apelar contra una sentencia en que se absuelve al acusado, por la razon 
de que por segunda vez se le pone en peligro de ser castigado por el misrao 
delito. 'El ; derecho comun americano prohibia tambien un segundo juicio por el 
misnio delito hubiera el acusado sufrido o no algun castigo, o sido absuelto o 
condenado en una causa anterior.'</p>
<p>"En la causa de Estados Unidos contra Sanges, citada en la de Kepner, se 
dijo: 'Desde la epoca del Lord Hale hasta la fecha del caso de Chadwick que 
acabamos de citar, los libros de texto, con raras excepciones, 6 dan por 
supuesto 6. afirman que el acusado, (o su representante), es el unico que puede 
obtener un nuevo juicio 6 recurrir en casacion en causa criminal, y una 
sentencia en ^u favor es definitiva y concluyente. (Veanse 2 Hawk., c. 47, sec. 
12; c. 50, secciones 10 y siguientes; Bac. Ab. Trial, L. 9; Error, B; 1 Chit, 
Crim. Law, 657, 747; Stark. Crim. PI. Segunda Edicion 357, S67, 371; Archb. 
Crim. PL, (Duodecima Edicion Inglesa y Edicion sexta americana) 177, 199, 
Segunda Edicion, 357, 367, 371; Archb. Crim. P. I.)</p>
<p>"* * * No se ha dado ningun caso de recurso de casacion contra una sentencia 
en favor del acusado, despues de absuelto.'" (Archbold Cr. PI &amp; Pr., 
Pomeroy's Ed., 199.)</p>
<p>'No error, however flagrant, committed by the court against the estate, can 
be reserved by it for decision by the supreme court when the defendant has once 
been placed in jeopardy and discharged, even though the discharge was the result 
of the error committed. (State vs. Rook, 49 L. R. A. 186, 61 Kan. 382, 59 Pac. 
653.' (1 . L. R. A. 242.)</p>
<p>"Este Tribunal nunca ha resuelto una cuestion parecida a la causa presente en 
que el acusado fue condenado por una pena menor que la seiialada por la ley y el 
ministerio fiscal, en apelacion, pide que de acuerdo con el Codigo Penal 
Eevisado, se imponga al acusado una pena mayor. Si el fiscal-como el 
acusado—puede apelar para corregir un error de ley, entonces sera forzoso 
imponer al acusado la pena de reclusion perpetua. Despues de haber sido ya—por 
error— condenado or el tribunal inferior a la pena de 12 anos de prision mayor a 
20 anos de reclusion temporal, ?no es poner otra vez al acusado en peligro de 
ser condenado a mayor pena por el mismo delito? Si el acusado fuese el apelante, 
no tendria derecho a quejarse si se le impusiera una pena mayor; en el caso 
presente el que apela es el ministerio fiscal, y dicha apelacion pone en peligro 
al acusado de recibir otra condena mayor. Creemos que en el caso presente se 
pone al acusado en doble <em>jeopardy</em>, esto es, en el peligro de recibir la 
condena de reclusion perpetua despues de haber sido condenado ya por el juzgado 
inferior a una pena menor. Por este peligro, el ministerio fiscal no puede 
apelar, de acuerdo con el articulo 2 de la Regla 118 y siguiendo la garantia 
constitutional de que 'No se pondra a una persona en peligro de ser castigada 
dos veces por la misma infraccion' o en <em>jeopardy</em>."</p></blockquote>
<p>The prosecution in the case at bar urges a reexamination of the question 
decided in the Ang Cho Kio cases and a reconsideration of the view therein 
expressed by this Court. To our mind, however, the reasons advanced by the 
Solicitor General in support of his pretense are not sufficiently weighty to 
warrant a reversal of said view which is a mere corollary of the practice 
established in the Philippines and in the United States, for so long a time as 
to form part and parcel, not merely of the settled jurisprudence, but, also, of 
the constitutional law, in both jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the prosecution cannot appeal from the decision against herein 
defendant-appellee, the propriety of the penalty therein meted out to him is 
beyond our power to review.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appeal is dismissed, without special pronouncement as to 
costs. It is so ordered.</p>
