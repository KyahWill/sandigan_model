				<H3>EDUARDO HILVANO, PETITIONER, VS. FIDEL FERNANDEZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF SAMAR, RESPONDENT.<br><br>
D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Eduardo Hilvano was accused of the crime of malversation of public 
funds in criminal case No. 2585 of the Court of First Instance of Samar. Upon 
arraignment, he entered a plea of not guilty to the information, but prayed for 
a continuance, which was granted. At the hearing of Juanary 16, 1953, however, 
he petitioned the court to allow him to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to 
substitute it with one of guilty. His petition was granted, and on the same day, 
judgment was rendered sentencing him to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from 
8 years to 10 years and 8 months of <em>prision mayor</em>, with perpetual 
disqualification, to pay a fine of P12,000, to indemnify the government in the 
sum of P12,644.50, and to pay the costs. The petitioner, who was out on bail, 
requested through the Department of Justice, that he be allowed to serve 
sentence in Muntinlupa prison, waiving the reading of the sentence in Samar; and 
accordingly, the sentence was read to him in the New Bilibid Prisons in 
Muntinlupa, Rizal, on April 3, 1954; and on the same day, he commenced serving 
sentence.
<p>On April 12, 1954, petitioner filed a motion for the reconsideration of the 
aforesaid judgment, upon the ground that the penalty meted out by the Court was 
excessive. This petition was denied and copy of the order of denial was received 
by petitioner on May 24, 1954. On May 27, 1954, petitioner filed notice of 
appeal with the Office of the Director of Prisons, together with a motion for 
the reduction of his personal bail bond to enable him to file an appeal bond. He 
swore to his notice of appeal on May 27, 1954, and submitted to the trial court 
on June 1, 1954. Because the trial court refused to give due course to his 
appeal and denied his motion for reduction of bail, petitioner filed this 
petition for a writ of <em>mandamus</em> with this Court to compel the 
respondent Judge to allow his appeal and to fix his appeal bond at P10,000.</p>
<p>It is admitted by the petitioner that the judgment of the lower Court finding 
him guilty of the crime charged in Criminal Case No. 2585 was promulgated on 
April 3, 1954, and that he commenced to servo sentence on the same day (Amended 
Petition, par. 3). In fact, in an affidavit attached to his petition before this 
Court to be allowed to litigate as pauper, he states that he is at present 
confined in Muntinlupa serving sentence because of the decision in question. 
Therefore, the judgment rendered against him had become final and nonappealable 
on April 3, 1954, when he commenced serving sentence (Rule 116, section 7; 
Gregorio <em>vs</em>. Director of Prisons, 43 Phil., 650; People <em>vs</em>. 
Quebral, 76 Phil., 294, 42 Off. Gaz., 2788; People <em>vs</em>. Feliciano, 89 
Phil., 664); hence, the lower Court did not err in disallowing his appeal filed 
after it had already lost jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p>Petitioner contends that he was committed to prison on April 3, 1954, not for 
the purpose of commencing service of sentence, but on account of his inability 
to procure bond for his provisional release; and that his commitment not having 
been accompanied by his assent or conformity to the judgment, said judgment did 
not become final on said date. There is no merit in this contention. As we have 
already pointed out, petitioner admits in his petition that he was committed to 
the New Bilibid prisons on April 3, 1954 "to serve the sentence"; and it appears 
from the order of the Court below of March 19, 1954 (Annex 3, Memorandum for 
Respondents) that petitioner was not only out on bail before his commitment, but 
that he had even requested the Secretary of Justice to ask the trial Court to 
authorize the Director of Prisons in Muntinlupa to read sentence to him, because 
he desired to enter jail without appearing in the Court of First Instance of 
Samar for the promulgation of the judgment against him.</p>
<p>Considering that petitioner himself expressed his desire to serve sentence 
meted upon him, and that sucii desire necessarily imports knowledge of and 
willingness to abide by the penalty meted by the trial Court, the judgment 
against petitioner became final and executory on April 3, 1954 when he started 
serving sentence thereon. Therefore, it becomes unnecessary for us to determine 
whether or not his notice of appeal was filed within fifteen days from 
promulgation of the judgment.</p>
<p>The petition for mandamus is denied. Without costs.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Acting C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo</em>, and 
<em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition denied.</em></p></div>
