				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This  is  an appeal by certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals. <br><br>Briefly,  the  facts  are:   On  June  4, 1949, petitioner herein,  Santos  Evangelista, instituted  Civil Case  No.  8235 ef the Court of First Instance  of Manila, entitled "Santos Evangelista <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ricardo Rivera," for a sum of money.  On the same date,  he obtained a  writ of attachment, which was levied upon a house, built by Rivera on a land situated in Manila and  leased to him,  by filing  copy of said writ and the corresponding notice of attachment with  the  Office of the Register of Deeds of Manila, on June 8,  1949.   In due course, judgment was rendered in favor of Evangelista, who,  on October 8, 1951, bought the house at public auction held  in compliance  with the  writ of execution  issued  in said  case.  The corresponding  definite  deed  of  sale  was issued to  him on October 22,  1952, upon expiration of the period of redemption.  When Evangelista sought to  take possession of the house, Rivera refused to  surrender it, upon  the ground  that he had  leased the  property from the Alto Surety &amp;  Insurance Co., Inc.—respondent herein—and that the latter is now the true owner of said  property. It appears that on May 10,  1952, a definite  deed of sale of the same  house  had  been  issued to  respondent,  as  the highest bidder at  an auction  sale held,  on September 29, 1950, in compliance  with a  writ of  execution issued in Civil  Case  No. 6268  of the same  court,  entitled "Alto Surety  &amp; Insurance Co.,  Inc. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Maximo Quiambao,  Rosario  Guevara  and Ricardo Rivera," in which judgment, for the sum of money, had  been rendered  in  favor of respondent herein, as plaintiff  therein.  Hence,  on June 13, 1953, Evangelista instituted the present action against respondent and Ricardo Rivera,  for the  purpose  of  establishing  his  (Evangelista) title  over  said  house, and securing possession, thereof, apart  from recovering  damages. <br><br>In  its answer, respondent alleged, in  substance,  that  it has a better right to the house,  because the sale  made, and the definite  deed of sale executed, in its favor, on September 29, 1950 and May 10, 1952, respectively, precede the sale to Evangelista (October 8, 1951) and the definite deed  of sale in his favor  (October 22, 1952).  It, also, made  some special defenses  which are  discussed hereafter. Rivera,  in effect,  joined  forces with respondent.   After due trial,  the Court of First Instance  of Manila  rendered judgment  for Evangelista, sentencing Rivera and respondent to deliver the house in question  to petitioner herein and to pay him, jointly and severally, forty pesos  (P40.00) a month  from October,  1952,  until  said  delivery, plus costs. <br><br>On  appeal taken  by respondent,  this decision was reversed by  the  Court  of  Appeals, which  absolved said respondent from  the complaint,  upon  the ground  that, although  the writ of attachment in favor  of Evangelista had been filed with the Register of Deeds  of Manila prior to  the sale  in favor of respondent, Evangelista  did not acquire thereby a preferential lien, the attachment having been levied  as if the house in  question were immovable property, although, in the  opinion of the Court of Appeals, it is "ostensibly a personal property,"   As such, the Court of  Appeals held,  "the  order of  attachment  * * * should have been  served in the  manner  provided in subsection (e)  of section  7 of Rule  59,"  of the  Rules  of Court, reading: <br><blockquote>"The property of the defendant shall be attached  by the officer executing the order in the following: manner: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*******<br></div><br>"(<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>)  Debts and credits, and other personal property <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> capable of manual delivery, by <span style="font-style: italic;">leaving with the person owing such debts, or having  in his possession or under his control, such credits or other personal property, or with his agent, a copy  of the order, and a notice that the debts owing by him to  the defendant,</span> and the credits and other personal property in his possession, or under his control, belonging to the defendant, are attached in pursuance of such order." (Italics ours.) </blockquote>However, the Court of  Appeals  seems to have  been of the  opinion,  also, that  the house of Rivera should  have been attached in accordance with subsection  (c)  of said section 7, as "personal property capable of manual delivery, <span style="font-style: italic;">by  taking and  safely keeping in his custody"</span>, for it declared that  "Evangelista  could  not  have  *  * *  validly purchased Ricardo Rivera's house from the sheriff a<span style="font-style: italic;">s the latter was not in possession  thereof</span> at the time he sold it at a public auction." <br><br>Evangelista now seeks a review,  by  certiorari,  of this decision of the Court of Appeals.   In  this  connection, it is not disputed that although the sale to the respondent preceded that made to Evangelista, the latter would have a better right if the writ  of  attachment, issued  in  his favor  <span style="font-style: italic;">before</span> the  sale to the respondent, had been properly executed or enforced.  This question, in turn, depends upon whether the house of Ricardo Rivera is real property or  not.  In the affirmative case,  the applicable provision would be subsection (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) of section 7, Rule  59 of the Rules of Court, pursuant to which the attachment should be made "by filing with the registrar of deeds a copy of the order, together with a  description  of  the  property attached, and a notice  that it is attached, and by  leaving a copy of  such order, description, and notice with the occupant of the property, if any there be."<br><br>Respondent maintains, however, and the Court of Appeals held,  that Rivera's house is personal property,  the levy upon which must be made in conformity  with subsections  (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) and  (<span style="font-style: italic;">e</span>) of said section 7 of Rule 59.  Hence, the main issue before us is whether a house, constructed by  the lessee  of  the land on which it is built,  should be dealt with, for  purposes of  attachment,  as  immovable property, or as personal  property. <br><br>It is  our considered opinion that  said house is  not personal  property, much less  a  debt,1 Credit  or  other personal  property not capable of  manual delivery, but immovable property..   As explicitly held, in  Laddera  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hodges  (48 Off. Gaz.,  5374), "a true  building  (not merely superimposed on the soil)  <span style="font-style: italic;">is  immovable or real property,</span> whether it is erected by the owner of the land or by  a usufructuary or <span style="font-style: italic;">lessee.</span>  This is the doctrine of our Supreme  Court  in Leung Yee  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Strong  Machinery Company, 37  Phil., 644.  And  it is amply supported  by the rulings of the French Court *  *  *." <br><br>It is true that the parties to a deed of chattel mortgage may agree to consider a house as personal property for purposes of said contract (Luna <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Encarnacion,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span>48 Off. Gaz., 2664;  Standard Oil Co. of New York <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Jaramillo, .44 Phil.,  630;  De  Jesus  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Juan Dee Co.,  Inc., 72 Phil., 464).   However,  this view  is good only  insofar  as  the contracting  parties  are  concerned.  It  is  based,  partly, upon the  principle  of  estoppel.  Neither  this  principle, nor said view, is applicable to strangers to said contract. Much less is it in  point where there has been no contract whatsoever, with  respect to  the  status of the  house  involved,  as in  the  case at bar.  Apart from this,  in Manarang  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Ofilada (99 Phil.,  108; 52 Off. Gaz.,  3954),  we held: <br><blockquote>"The question  now before us,  however, is:  Does  the fact  that the parties  entering  into a  contract regarding a  house gave  said property the  consideration of personal property in their  contract, bind the sheriff  in advertising the property's sale at  public auction as personal property? It is to be remembered that in the case at bar the action was  to collect a loan secured by a chattel mortgage on the house.  It is  also to be remembered that in  practice it is the judgment creditor who points out to  the  sheriff  the properties that the sheriff  is to levy  upon  in execution, and  the judgment creditor in the case  at bar is the party in whose  favor the owner of the house had  conveyed it by way of chattel mortgage and, therefore,  knew its consideration  as personal property. <br><br>"These considerations notwithstanding, we hold  that the rules on execution do  <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>  allow, and  we should  <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> interpret  them  in such a way as to allow, the special consideration that parties to a contract may have desired to impart to real estate,  for  example, as personal property, when they are not ordinarily so. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sales on execution affect the public  and third persons.  The regulation governing  sales on execution are for public officials to follow.</span>   The form of proceedings prescribed for each kind of property is suited  to its  character,  not to the character which the parties  have  given to it or desire to  give it.  When the rules  speak of personal  property, property which is ordinarily so  considered is meant;  and when real property is spoken of, <span style="font-style: italic;">it means  properly which is  generally  known, as real property. The regulations  were never intended to suit  the consideration  that parties may have privately given to the property levied upon.</span>  Enforcement of  regulations  would be difficult were the convenience or agreement of  private  parties to determine  or govern  the nature of the proceedings.   We, therefore, hold that the <span style="font-style: italic;">mere fact that a house was the subject of a chattel mortgage and was considered as personal property by the parties does  not make said house personal property for purposes of the notice to be given for  its sale at public, auction</span>. This  ruling  is demanded  by the  need  for a  definite, orderly  and  well-defined regulation for official and public  guidance and which would prevent confusion and misunderstanding. <br><br>"We, therefore, declare that <span style="font-style: italic;">the house  of mixed materials levied upon on execution,</span> although subject of a contract of chattel mortgage between the owner and a third person, <span style="font-style: italic;">is real property within the purview of Rule 39, section 16, of the Rules of Court as it has become a permanent  fixture of the land, which is real  property. </span> (42 Am. Jur.  199-200; Leung Yee <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Strong Machinery Co.,  37 Phil., 644; Republic <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>  Ceniza, et al., 90 Phil., 544; Ladera,  et al. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hodges, et al.,  [C.A.], 48 Off. Gaz., 5374.)" (Italics ours.) </blockquote>The foregoing considerations apply,  with  equal force, to the conditions for the levy of attachment, for it similarly affects the public and third persons. <br><br>It is argued, however, that, even if the house in question were immovable property, its  attachment  by  Evangelista was void or ineffective, because, in the language of the Court of Appeals, "after presenting a  copy of the order of attachment in the Office of the Register of Deeds, <span style="font-style: italic;">the person who might then be in possession of the house, the sheriff took  no  pains to  serve Ricardo  Rivera, or other copies thereof."</span>   This finding of the Court of Appeals  is neither conclusive upon  us,  nor accurate. <br><br>The Record  on Appeal, annexed to the petition for certiorari, shows that petitioner alleged, in paragraph 3 of the complaint, that he acquired the house in  question "as a consequence of the  levy of an attachment and execution of the judgment in Civil  Case No.  8235" of the Court of First Instance of Manila.  In his answer  (paragraph 2), Ricardo  Rivera  <span style="font-style: italic;">admitted</span> said  attachment  and execution of  judgment.  He  alleged, however, by way  of  special defense,  that  the  title of  respondent  "is  <span style="font-style: italic;">superior</span> to that of plaintiff because  it  is  based on a public  instrument,"  whereas Evangelista  relied  upon  a  "promissory note"  which  "is only a  private instrument"; that  said public instrument in favor of respondent "<span style="font-style: italic;">is superior</span> also to the judgment in Civil Case  No. 8235"; and that plaintiff's claim against Rivera amounted only to P866,  "which is much below the real  value" of said house, for which reason it  would be  "grossly  unjust to allow plaintiff  to acquire the property for such an inadequate consideration". Thus,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Rivera impliedly admitted that  his  house  had been attached,</span> that the house had  been sold to Evangelista<span style="font-style: italic;">  in accordance with the</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">requisite formalities</span>, and  that  said attachment was valid, although  allegedly <span style="font-style: italic;">inferior</span> to the rights of  respondent,  and  the consideration  for the  sale to Evangelista was claimed to be <span style="font-style: italic;">inadequate</span>. <br><br>Respondent, in turn, denied the allegation in said paragraph 3 of the complaint, <span style="font-style: italic;">but  only "for the reasons stated in its special  defenses"</span> namely: (1) that by virtue of the sale at public auction,  and the final deed  executed by the sheriff in favor  of  respondent,  the  same  became  the "legitimate owner of  the  house" in  question;  (2) that respondent "is a buyer in good faith and  for value";  (3) that  respondent  "took  possession  and  control  of said house";  (4)  that "there "was  no valid  attachment by the plaintiff and/or the Sheriff of Manila of  the property in question a<span style="font-style: italic;">s neither took  actual or constructive possession or control of the property  at any time"</span>; and  (5) "that the alleged registration of plaintiff's attachment, certificate of sale and final deed  in the Office, of Register of Deeds, Manila, if there was any,  is likewise,  not valid <span style="font-style: italic;">as there is no registry of transactions' covering houses erected on land  belonging to  or  leased from  another.</span>"   In this manner, respondent claimed a better right, merely under the theory that, in case of double sale of immovable property,  the purchaser who  first  obtains  possession in good faith,  acquires title,  if the sale  has not  been  "recorded * * * in the Registry of  Property" (Art. 1544, Civil Code of the Philippines), and  that the writ of attachment and the notice  of  attachment in favor of  Evangelista should be considered  unregistered, "as there  is  <span style="font-style: italic;">no  registry</span>  of transactions covering houses erected on land belonging to or leased from another."  In fact,  said article   1544  of the Civil Code of the Philippines, governing  double sales, was quoted  on page 15 of the brief for respondent in the Court of .Appeals, in support of its fourth assignment of error therein,  to  the effect  that  it  "has preference or priority over the sale of the same property" to Evangelista. <br><br>In other words, <span style="font-style: italic;">there  was no issue</span> on whether copy of the writ  and notice of  attachment  had been  served  on Rivera.   No <span style="font-style: italic;">evidence whatsoever</span>, to the effect that Rivera had not been served  with copies of said writ and notice, was introduced in the  Court of First Instance.  In  its brief in the Court of Appeals, <span style="font-style: italic;">respondent did not aver, or even intimate, that no  such copies  were served by the sheriff upon Rivera</span>.   Service thereof on Rivera had been <span style="font-style: italic;">impliedly admitted by the defendants,</span> in their respective answers,  and by their behaviour throughout the proceedings in  the Court of  First  Instance, and,  as regards respondent,  in the Court of Appeals.  In fact,  petitioner asserts in his brief herein (p. 26) that <span style="font-style: italic;">copies of said writ and notice were delivered to Rivera,  simidtaneously with copy of the complaint, upon service of summons</span>, prior to the filing of copies of said writ and notice with the register of  deeds, and  <span style="font-style: italic;">the truth of  this  assertion  has not been directly and positively challenged or denied in the brief filed before us by respondent herein</span>.  The latter did not dare therein  to go beyond making a statement—for the first time in the  course  of these proceedings, begun  almost five (5) years ago  (June 18,  1953)—reproducing substantially the aforementioned finding of the Court  of  Appeals and then quoting the same. <br><br>Considering, therefore, that <span style="font-style: italic;">neither the pleadings, nor the briefs in the  Court of Appeals, raised am  issue on whether or not copies  of the  writ of attachment and notice of attachment had been served upon Rivera; that the  defendants  had impliedly  admitted—in  said pleadings and briefs, as well as  by their conduct during the entire proceedings, prior to the rendition of the decision of the Court of Appeals—that Rivera had received copies of said documents</span>;  and that, for this reason, evidently,  no proof was  and introduced thereon, we are of the opinion, and so hold that the finding of the Court of Appeals to the effect that said copies had not been  served  upon Rivera  is based upon a misapprehension  of the specific issues involved therein and goes  <span style="font-style: italic;">beyond</span> the range of such issues, apart from being <span style="font-style: italic;">contrary</span> to the aforementioned  admission by the parties, and  that,  accordingly, a  grave  abuse  of discretion was committed in making said finding, which is, furthermore, inaccurate. <br><br>Wherefore,  the  decision  of  the Court of Appeals  is hereby reversed, and  another one shall be entered affirming that of the Court  of First  Instance  of Manila, with the costs  of this instance against respondent, the Alto  Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.  It is so  ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B.
