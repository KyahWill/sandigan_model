				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; from&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; finding appellant&nbsp; Joaquin Guzman guilty&nbsp; of the crime of qualified theft.<p>The facts, as&nbsp; found by the Court of&nbsp; Appeals, are&nbsp; as follows:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"That&nbsp; accused Joaquin&nbsp; Guzman&nbsp; was a travelling sales&nbsp; agent of the New&nbsp; Life&nbsp; Commercial of Aparri,&nbsp; Cagayan.&nbsp; On&nbsp; March&nbsp; 2, 1953, Guzman left Manila with 45 cases of different assortments&nbsp; of La&nbsp; Tondeiia&nbsp; wine, in a&nbsp; truck driven by Andres Buenaventura, with&nbsp; Federico&nbsp; Cabacungan&nbsp; as washing&nbsp; (helper),&nbsp; on&nbsp; their return trip&nbsp; to Aparri, by way&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ilocos Norte.&nbsp; Along&nbsp; the&nbsp; route, the accused made various cash sales of wine&nbsp; and when they reached Ballesteros, Cagayan, at&nbsp; about 3 o'clock&nbsp; in the&nbsp; afternoon&nbsp;&nbsp; of March 5,&nbsp; 1953, said accused had in his possession the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P4,873.62.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, they parked their truck&nbsp; at the&nbsp; Sambrano&nbsp; Station and&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused left his&nbsp; companions until supper&nbsp; time at past 7:00&nbsp; p.m.&nbsp; When they retired for&nbsp; the night, driver Buenaventura and&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused occupied the driver's&nbsp; compartment of the&nbsp; truck, Buenaventura lying on the&nbsp; driver's seat&nbsp; and the&nbsp; accused taking the upper deck with&nbsp; which the truck was provided&nbsp; (see photograph Exhibit. A).&nbsp; The&nbsp; washing,&nbsp; Cabacungan, slept in the body of the 'truck where the&nbsp; wines were kept.&nbsp; There&nbsp; was a wall between the body of the truck and&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver's compartment;&nbsp; and on that night&nbsp; all the windows were&nbsp; locked&nbsp; from&nbsp; inside.&nbsp; In the morning&nbsp; of March 6, 1953,&nbsp; accused Guzman told&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver that he&nbsp; lost the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of P2,840.50,&nbsp; and his firearm license.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the advice of the&nbsp; driver,&nbsp; said accused reported the matter to the Chief oÂ£ Police of Ballesteros, who gave him a certificate of loss of his firearm license.&nbsp; They were&nbsp; proceeding to their home journey when, at the outskirts of Ballesteros, they were met by&nbsp; a&nbsp; tax collector and&nbsp; policeman&nbsp; Mariano David who told the accused to&nbsp; return&nbsp; to Ballesteros and execute&nbsp; an&nbsp; anidavit regarding the&nbsp; alleged theft. Before the accused returned to Ballesteros,&nbsp; he entrusted to the driver Buenaventura, the amount&nbsp; of Pl,630 in dash and a check for P403.12 under the proper receipt&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; C), with the sales invoices, for&nbsp; delivery to the&nbsp; manager,&nbsp; Enrique Go, of the company of Aparri. Driver and washing continued the trip and arrived&nbsp; at Aparri between 3&nbsp; and 4 o'clock in&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon of the same day. The driver delivered the money and invoices&nbsp; to&nbsp; Enrique Go and informed&nbsp; the latter of the&nbsp; loss.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go&nbsp; reported&nbsp; the matter to the Philippine Constabulary.&nbsp; The PC&nbsp; investigators and Go picked the accused at his house at Aparri at 8&nbsp; o'clock in the morning, on March 7, 1953, after having failed to see him (accused) at Ballesteros the previous night. Questioned at the PC barracks&nbsp; as to how much money he still had, the accused stated that he had&nbsp; only P3, in his person.&nbsp; On March 10, 1953,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused wrote to Go,&nbsp; requesting him to defer the filing of the criminal complaint until March 16, 1953, on which date he promised to refund the amount lost (Exhibit G).&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 17, 1953, the said accused paid the amount of P1,500 to Go.&nbsp; On April 1,&nbsp; 1953, the accused was prosecuted for theft for the&nbsp; shortage of P804.70."&nbsp; (Appellant's Brief, pp.&nbsp; 13-15.)</p></blockquote><p>Appellant Guzman claims,&nbsp; first,&nbsp; that under the&nbsp; above findings of fact,&nbsp; he had&nbsp; committed only&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa;</span> and second, as the crimes of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> and theft are essentially&nbsp; different offenses,&nbsp; he should be acquitted of the present charge for qualified&nbsp; theft,&nbsp; although proceedings may be filed anew against him for the proper offense. We&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; appellant that under the above&nbsp; facts, the Court of&nbsp; Appeals erred in holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; he "had only the material&nbsp; or physical possession of&nbsp; the said merchandise or its proceeds, because he was not the owner&nbsp; thereof; he was simply holding the money&nbsp; for&nbsp; and in behalf of&nbsp; his&nbsp; employer".</p><p>While&nbsp; it is true&nbsp; that&nbsp; appellant received&nbsp; the proceeds of&nbsp; his&nbsp; wine&nbsp; sales&nbsp; as travelling salesman&nbsp; for the&nbsp; complainant, for and in behalf of the latter as&nbsp; his principal, and that&nbsp; possession of the&nbsp; agent&nbsp; is&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the principal, an agent, unlike a servant&nbsp; or messenger, has both the physical&nbsp; and juridical&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the goods received&nbsp; in agency,&nbsp; or&nbsp; the proceeds thereof, which takes the place of the&nbsp; goods&nbsp; after their sale by the&nbsp; agent. His duty to turn&nbsp; over the proceeds of the agency depends upon his discharge, as&nbsp; well as the result of the accounting between&nbsp; him and the principal; and he may set up his&nbsp; right of&nbsp; possession as against that of&nbsp; the&nbsp; principal until the agency&nbsp; is&nbsp; terminated.</p><p>The&nbsp; case cited&nbsp; by the Court&nbsp; of Appeals (People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Locson, 57 Phil., 325), in support of its theory that appellant only had the material possession of the merchandise he&nbsp; was selling for his&nbsp; principal, or&nbsp; their proceeds, is not in point.&nbsp; In&nbsp; said case, the receiving teller&nbsp; of a bank&nbsp; who misappropriated,&nbsp; money received by&nbsp; him&nbsp; for the bank, was held guilty&nbsp; of qualified theft on the theory that the possession of the teller is the possession of&nbsp; the bank.&nbsp; There is an essential distinction&nbsp; between the possession by a receiving teller of funds received&nbsp; from third persons paid to the bank,&nbsp; and an&nbsp; agent&nbsp; who receives the proceeds&nbsp; of sales of merchandise&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; to&nbsp; him&nbsp; in agency&nbsp; by&nbsp; his principal.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the former case,&nbsp; payment by&nbsp; third&nbsp; persons&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; teller&nbsp; is payment&nbsp; to the bank itself; the teller is&nbsp; a mere custodian&nbsp; or keeper&nbsp; of&nbsp; the funds received,&nbsp; and&nbsp; has no&nbsp; independent right or title to retain or&nbsp; possess the same&nbsp; as against&nbsp; the&nbsp; bank.&nbsp; An agent, on the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; can even&nbsp; assert,&nbsp; as against his own principal, an independent,&nbsp; autonomous, right to retain the&nbsp; money or goods received&nbsp; in&nbsp; consequence&nbsp; of the agency; as when they principal fails to reimburse him for advances he has made,&nbsp; and indemnify him for damages suffered&nbsp; without his fault&nbsp; (Article 1915, new Civil Code; Article 1730, old).</p><p>As appellant converted to&nbsp; his own&nbsp; use proceeds&nbsp; of sales&nbsp; of merchandise delivered&nbsp; to him&nbsp; as agent, which he&nbsp; received in&nbsp; trust&nbsp; for and&nbsp; under obligation to&nbsp; deliver and turn over&nbsp; to&nbsp; his principal, he is guilty of the crime of&nbsp; estafa as defined by Article 315,&nbsp; paragraph 1, subparagraph (e), of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code.&nbsp; This has been the consistent&nbsp; ruling of&nbsp; this Court&nbsp; in&nbsp; cases&nbsp; where&nbsp; a sales&nbsp; agent misappropriates or&nbsp; fails to&nbsp; turn&nbsp; over to his principal proceeds of things&nbsp; or goods&nbsp; he was commissioned or&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; to&nbsp; sell for&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; (U. S.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Reyes, 36 Phil., 791; U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Lim,&nbsp; 36 Phil.,&nbsp; 682; People <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Leachon, 56 Phil., 737).</p><p>The next question is&nbsp; whether the present&nbsp; information for qualified theft&nbsp; alleges&nbsp; sufficient facts to&nbsp; sustain&nbsp; a conviction for estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1, subparagraph&nbsp; (b), of the Revised Penal Code. The information reads:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The undersigned accuses&nbsp; Joaquin&nbsp; Guzman&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of Qualified Theft, defined&nbsp; and penalized under Articles&nbsp; 308 and 309, No. 3 in connection with Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Commonwealth Acts Nos. 273 and 417 and Republic Act No. 120, committed as follows:</p></blockquote><p>That on or about the 6th day of March, 1953, in the municipality of Aparri, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Court, the&nbsp; said&nbsp; accused Joaquin&nbsp; Guzman, while in the employ of Enrique Go and with grave abuse of&nbsp; confidence did then&nbsp; and&nbsp; there, willfully, unlawfully,&nbsp; and&nbsp; feloniously,&nbsp; with intent to&nbsp; gain&nbsp; but without violence against or intimidation of persons&nbsp; nor force upon things, without the consent of the owner Enrique Go alias Ngo Yat,&nbsp; take and&nbsp; carry away for his personal use and benefit&nbsp; the sum of&nbsp; eight hundred four pesos and seventy eentavos&nbsp; (P804.70)&nbsp; to the damages and prejudice of said Enrique Go altos&nbsp; Ngo Yat, in the amount of&nbsp; P804.70."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Original Records p. 22.)</p><p>Article 315, paragraph 1, subparagraph&nbsp; (6),&nbsp; on&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>Surindling</em>&nbsp; (<em>estafa</em>).âAny&nbsp; person&nbsp; who&nbsp; shall&nbsp; defraud&nbsp; another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:</p></blockquote><p align="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>(2) With unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence, namely:</p><p align="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *</p><p>(b) By misappropriating&nbsp; or converting, to the prejudice of another, money, goods, or&nbsp; any other&nbsp; personal&nbsp; property&nbsp; received by the offender in&nbsp; trust or on commission, or&nbsp; for&nbsp; administration, or under any other obligation involving the&nbsp; duty&nbsp; to&nbsp; make delivery of, or to&nbsp; return the same,&nbsp; even though such obligation&nbsp; be totally or partially guaranteed by a bond;&nbsp; or by denying having received such money, good, or other property;</p></blockquote><p>Under the above definition of<em> estafa,</em> it is an&nbsp; essential element of the crime that the money or goods misappropriated&nbsp; or converted&nbsp; by the accused&nbsp; to the&nbsp; prejudice of another was&nbsp; received by him "in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any&nbsp; other obligation involving the duty to&nbsp; make delivery of, or to retain&nbsp; the same".&nbsp;&nbsp; No such allegation appears in the above&nbsp; information.&nbsp; Consequently, we&nbsp; agree with appellant that he&nbsp; can not&nbsp; be&nbsp; convicted thereunder of the&nbsp; crime of <span style="font-style: italic;">estafa</span> as defined&nbsp; by the&nbsp; article above.</p><p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed,&nbsp; and appellant Joaquin Guzman acquitted of the crime&nbsp; of qualified theft.&nbsp; Appellant should, however, be held in custody pending the&nbsp; filing of&nbsp; another&nbsp; information&nbsp; against him for estafa under Article 315,&nbsp; paragraph 1, subparagraph (6),&nbsp; of the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code.&nbsp; Without costs in this instance.&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia, </em>and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em>&nbsp; concur.<br></p></div>
