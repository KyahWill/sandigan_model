				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Appeal against an order dismissing the complaint. On November 20, 1952,  defendant leased to plaintiff a parcel of land situated along Taft Avenue, Ermita, Manila, for a monthly rental  of P490, payable  on or before the fifth day of each month.   The contract  provides that the term  of  the lease is two years, beginning on October 1, 1952, which may be extended for Another period not exceeding two years with the written consent of both parties. (Par. 2,  Exh. A of Exh. 1, p. 24, Record on Appeal.) </p>
<p>On October 15, 1954, defendant wrote plaintiff that the lease  expired on October 1, 1954, and that as the latter has lost  interest in renewing  the same and the retention by the lessee will mean a great financial loss to the owner, defendant is giving plaintiff notice of the termination of the contract.   (Par. 2, Complaint, p. 2, Record on Appeal.)</p>
<p>It is alleged  in plaintiff's complaint that it is not true that plaintiff has lost  interest in the renewal  of the lease contract; that as defendant allowed plaintiff to choose to continue  the lease for another two years, defendant is now estopped from denying that the said period had actually  been extended for another period of two years; and that plaintiff has already paid defendant a considerable sum of money, besides spending another big sum  for  the improvements on the land.  Plaintiff prays that the court fix a longer  term for the lease, or rather extend the lease for another period of two years and that defendant be also required  to pay plaintiff P10,000 as indemnity for  moral damanges, because defendant's wife had stated that a check issued by the plaintiff had been dishonored, such statement having been made  for the purpose of affecting adversely plaintiff's business. '</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the summons, defendant promptly filed a motion  to dismiss  the complaint on the following grounds: that the  court has no jurisdiction  to graift  the  remedy prayed for in the complaint that there  is another action pending between the same parties and for the same cause; that the complaint states no cause of action against defendant; and that plaintiff's claim can not  be enforced because the same  is barred by the Statute of Frauds.  In connection with the allegation that another action is pending between the same parties and for the same cause, a copy  of a  complaint for ejectment filed by the defendant against plaintiff in the Municipal Court of Manila on December 20, 1954,  was attached as Exhibit  1.  The complaint for ejectment alleges that the lease was terminated on  October 1, 1954, and  that even if the contract could be extended for another period of two years the same  had already expired on December 20, 1954.</p>
<p>In his reply to the motion for dismissal, plaintiff argues that as the ejectment suit in the Municipal  Court of Manila was filed  later than  plaintiff's action in the  Court of First  Instance,  the former  must be  dismissed;  that the plaintiff is claiming moral damages for P10,000,  and this must be determined in  the  Court of  First Instance; and that by the letter  that the defendant has sent plaintiff, the defendant  is estopped from denying that the contract of lease has been extended for another period  of  two years. The trial  court, after  considering a rejoinder of  defendant to plaintiff's reply,  sustained the motion for dismissal on  the ground  that in  view of the filing of the action for  ejectment  or  unlawful  detainer,  all matters alleged in  the plaintiff's complaints could  be  decided therein.  After the denial of plaintiff's  motion for the reconsideration of the  order, plaintiff appealed  to  this Court.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in our mind that the  order of dismissal appealed  from should be sustained.  The  real  issue between the parties is whether  or not  the plaintiff-appellant should be allowed to continue occupying  the  land under the, terms  of the  lease contract.  This is  the  subject matter  of the action for unlawful detainer filed by defendant  in the Municipal Court, and it is also the main or  principal  purpose of  this Action.   As we have held in the case of Pue, et al.  vs. Gonzales, 87 Phil., 81 and in the recent case of Lim Si<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs. </span>Lim, 98 Phil., 856, the right of a lessee to occupy the  land leased against the lessor should be decided under Rule 72 of the Rules of Courts  The mere fact that the unlawful detainer  or ejectment case was filed later  did  not deter us from  applying this ruling in  the case of Lim  vs. Lim,  supra.</p>
<p>In  case at bar, we are led to the belief that the present action in  the  Court of First Instance was prompted by a  desire on plaintiff's part to anticipate the action for unlawful detainer,  the probability of which was  apparent from  the  letter of  the defendant to  the plaintiff advising the latter that  the contract of lease expired on October 1, 1954.   The  defendant evidently desired  to give plaintiff sufficient time to leave the premises  because no action for unlawful  detainer was filed immediately after the giving of the notice of the expiration of the lease.  But plaintiff took advantage of  defendant's  delayed' unlawful detainer suit to file this case in the Count of First Instance of anticipation  of the action  for unlawful  detainer,  in  order perhaps that he, may  claim that the action in the Court of First Instance was  prior to the unlawful detainer case, and,  therefore, should enjoy preference  over  the action filed  in  the Municipal  Court.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the Rules  do not require as  a ground for dismissal of a complaint  that  there is a prior pending  action.  They provide  that there is  a pending action, not a pending  prior action.  The fact that the  unlawful detainer suit was of a later date is no bar to  the dismissal  of the present action. We  find, therefore, no error  in the ruling of the court a quo that  plaintiff's action should be  dismissed  on the  ground of  the  pendency of another more appropriate action between the same parties and for the same cause.</p>
<p>It is also asserted by appellant that there is no identity between  the unlawful detainer case  filed by defendant and the ease at bar, first because this one is  for specific performance  or for declaratory  relief and second,  this suit also includes  a demand  for  moral damanges in the sum of P10,000, both of which remedies may not be be within tile municipal court's jurisdiction to try and  decide.  In answer  it may be stated that,  be that as it  may, plaintiff's action for declaratory relief  is improper;  this action  is mean  only  for  those cases where  a contract is  desired is be construed<em> prior to its</em> breach because of an impending controversy, that the parties thereto may be informed of their  rights thereunder. In  the  case at  bar, the  lease contract had  already expired  and there has already been a breach thereof, hence the action for a declaratory judgment  is no  longer proper.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Sec. 2. <em>Before Breach</em>.—A contract or statute may be  construed before  there as been a breach thereof."  (Rule 66, Rules of Court.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides, cognizance  of  actions  for declaratory  relief  is vested in the sound discretion  of the court, which may dismiss  the  action if a declaration is no longer necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Sec. 6. <em>Discretionary</em>,—The court may refuse to  exercise the power  to declare rights and to construe instruments in  any case where  a  decision under  it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy which gave rise to the action, or  in any case where the declaration, or construction is not necessary and proper at the time under all the circumstances."   (Id.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no  longer any need for the action,  even if proper, because  the  matter could be threshed out in the unlawful detainer suit that the defendant  had institute in  the municipal court.</p>
<p>It is  not  true  that  plaintiff's  supposed  rights to an extension can not be decided in the unlawful detainer suit. If the  plaintiff has any right to the extension of the lease at all, such right is a proper and legitimate issue that could be raised in  the  unlawful detainer  case, because it may be used as  a defense  to  the  action. Plaintiff suit, therefore, violates  the  principle prohibiting multiplicity of suits,  as the court a  quo correctly ruled.</p>
<p>The claim for damages is also invoked as a  ground for allowing the continuance of the action.  We note that this supposed cause of action is merely an incident of the main question of whether pr  not plaintiff should be allowed to continue the lease for two yejar3 more.]  It is  not alleged as an independent cause of action.   It is not set forth in a paragraph different from the others as the Rules require. If plaintiff wants to insist on  these damages,  he may do so clearly and plainly in another action; he may not assert it in the action for declaratory relief,  as an excuse or reason for continuing his said  suit for declaratory relief, which is improper under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The order of dismissal may also be sustained  on  another ground, namely that on the face of the complaint the plaintiff has no  cause of action against  defendant.  The contract expressly provides that the lease is for two years from October  1, 1952, but may be extended  by written consent of both parties for another  two years.   But there is no allegation in the complaint that this period of time was extended by the written consent of the parties.</p>
<p>The allegation  in the complaint that  the defendant's assumption that plaintiff was no longer interested in renewing the lease is false and estops defendants from claiming  that the lease has  been  terminated is either  a  conclusion of law  or it does not create  any right of action in favor of plaintiff for the extension of the lease.  As  the contract of lease can be extended, according to its terms, only by written consent  of the parties,  no right for extension can arise without such written consent. There is no allegation  that such  written  consent  was ever, given. Hence there is no sufficient ground alleged in the complaint for the plaintiff to be entitled to the extension.  The order of dismissal was, therefore, further justified by the  fact that plaintiff's complaint alleges no cause of action against defendant.</p>
<p>For the foregoing considerations, the judgment appealed from is hereby  affirmed,  with costs  against plaintiff-appellant.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J.,  Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor,  Jugo, Concepcion, Reyes,  J.  B. L., </em>and  <em>Endencia, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
