				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By a communication of respondent Arsenio H. Lacson, as Mayor of the City of 
Manila, reading:
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"<em>July 18, 1952</em></p>
<p>The Chief of Police<br>Manila</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>Under and by virtue of the provisions of Executive Order No. 264 issued by 
the late President Manuel L. Quezon of the former Commonwealth of the 
Philippines, the following officers and members of the Detective Bureau, Manila 
Police Department, are hereby summarily dismissed from the service, effective 
upon their being notified hereof, to wit:</p>
<ol><li>Det. Lt. Rosendo Meneses 
</li><li>Sgt. Mariano Litao 
</li><li>Det. Cpl. Eduardo Advincula 
</li><li>Det. Oscar Olegario 
</li><li>Det. Jesus Duran 
</li><li>Det. Jose C. Gonzales 
</li><li>Det. Mariano B. Rodriguez 
</li><li>Det. Alfredo Garcia 
</li><li>Det. Domingo Gomez" </li></ol>
<p align="right">Very respectfully,</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) Arsenio H. Lacson<br><em>Mayor, City of 
Manila</em></p></blockquote>
<p>copy of which was furnished the herein petitioners-appellees, Rosendo Meneses 
and Mariano Litao, together with a memorandum of the Chief of Police of Manila, 
of the following tenor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"<em>July 19, 1952</em></p>
<p>Memorandum for<br>The Chief, DB</p>
<p>1. I am sending herewith a copy of the order from His Honor, the Mayor of 
Manila, dated July 18, 1952, dismissing from the service Det. Lt. Rosendo 
Meneses and eight others effective upon their being notified thereof.</p>
<p>2. You are hereby instructed to notify them immediately of their dismissal, 
requiring them to acknowledge receipt of the notice on the duplicate thereof, 
which shall henceforth be forwarded to the Police Headquarters for record 
purposes. </p>
<p>3. They will be required to turn in their service equipment and other 
government properties and to have them comply with the attached clearance forms, 
which shall also be forwarded to the Police Headquarters." </p></blockquote>
<p>said petitioners-appellees were summarily dismissed from the service as 
detective lieutenant and sergeant, respectively, of the Manila Police 
Department. Hence, on July 26, 1952, said petitioners instituted the present 
action in the Court of First Instance of Manila for the purpose of securing a 
writ of mandamus directing the respondent Mayor of Manila to reinstate them in 
their aforementioned positions and to pay them their respective salaries, with 
damages and costs. </p>
<p>The case was submitted for decision upon a partial stipulation of facts and 
some testimonial and documentary evidence introduced by both parties. Pertinent 
parts of said stipulations are quoted hereunder: </p>

<p>Again, the last appointments extended to petitioners herein (Exhibits A and 
D) appear to be permanent in nature.</p>
<p>Upon the other hand, respondent mayor testified that Rosendo Meneses gambled 
beyond his means; that in the year 1950 or 1951, when he (respondent) was still 
a Congressman, he saw Meneses gambling heavily in the races; that Meneses was 
spending money beyond his means; that Mariano Litao sold a jeep officially 
assigned to him (Litao), and, as a consequence, an information for malversation 
of public property (Exhibit 1) was filed against him after his dismissal; that 
respondent received verbal reports from reliable people that Litao had committed 
extortions in the Chinatown; and that, in the course of the investigations 
conducted by respondent, he found out that it was very hard to prove the 
extortions made by Litao owing to the reluctance of the parties concerned to 
testify thereon. </p>
<p>In due course, the lower court rendered a decision, the dispositive part of 
which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, the petition for mandamus filed by Rosendo Meneses and Mariano C. 
Litao is hereby granted, and the respondent Mayor of the City of Manila is 
ordered to reinstate the petitioners in their respective positions as detective 
lieutenant at P3,120 per annum and detective sergeant at P2,580 per annum, 
respectively, in the Detective Bureau of the Manila Police Department, with 
right to receive their salaries from the respective dates of their dismissal. 
</p>
<p>Petitioners' claim for damages against the respondent in the amount of 
P23,000 is hereby denied. </p>
<p>No pronouncement is made as to costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>In his appeal from this decision, respondent maintains that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p>"The Trial Court erred in not holding that the position of detective is 
primarily confidential in nature as per Executive Order No. 264 of the President 
dated April 1, 1940, in relation to section 671(<em>j</em>) of the Revised 
Administrative Code.</p>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p>"The Court <em>a quo</em> also erred in not sustaining that Republic Act No. 
557 did not repeal hnpliedly Executive Order No. 264 and also said section 671 
(<em>j</em>) of the Revised Administrative Code, and that neither doea it 
constitute an exception to the provisions of section 682 of the Revised 
Administrative Code nor does it in any way, modify, amend, or repeal impliedly 
the same <em>pro tanto</em>.</p>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p>"The Court <em>a quo</em> likewise erred in ruling that the appointment of 
the appellee Mariano Litao was governed by Commonwealth Act No. 698 which was 
unconstitutional and therefore null and void and no longer in force, even if 
legal and valid, as it was repealed by Republic Act No. 271 approved June 15, 
1948, that provided expressly the revival of the laws applicable thereto before 
the enactment of said Commonwealth Act No. 698 such as section 2447 of the 
Revised Administrative Code until the enactment and approval of Republic Act No. 
409 (sections 11[<em>q</em>] and 12) and Executive Order No. 264 in relation to 
section 671 (<em>j</em>) of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended.</p>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<p>"The Trial Court finally erred in not finding that the appellees who are not 
civil service eligibles do not come under the provisions of Republic Act No. 557 
(Orais, et al. <em>vs</em>. Ribo, et al. G. R. No. L-4945) in accordance with 
section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, and because of the fact that the 
position of detectives is primarily confidential in nature which is the reason 
for not requiring appointees thereto to take and pass any civil service 
examination."</p></blockquote>
<p>These were the same issues raised in the case of Oscar Olegario <em>vs</em>. 
Arsenio H. Lacson (G. R. No. L-7926), and decided therein, on May 21,1955, in 
the following language.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is contended for the appellant Mayor that (1) the position of detective 
in the Manila Police Department is confidential in nature, having been so 
declared by Executive Order No. 264, Series of 1940, and that Republic Act 557 
did not repeal or affect said Executive Order; and (2) that appellee Oscar 
Olegario not being a Civil Service eligible, his appointment, in 1947, should be 
viewed as merely temporary under section 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, 
and, therefore, he was subject to summary dismissal at the expiration of three 
months.</p>
<p>The first issue tendered by the appellant has been thoroughly considered and 
resolved in previous decisions of this Court. In Mission <em>vs</em>. Del 
Rosario (1954) (50 Off. Gaz., 1571), this Court held that Executive Order No. 
264, Series of 1940, upon which appellant now relies, has been repealed by 
Republic Act 557, in so far as it may be in conflict with the latter, and that 
detectives or secret service agents may now be removed only as provided in said 
Act. This ruling was applied to similar offices in other localities (Abella 
<em>vs</em>. Rodriguez, 50 Off. Gaz., 3041; Palamine <em>vs</em>, Zagado, 50 
Off. Gaz., 1566), and we see no reason for not upholding it with respect to 
detectives or secret service agents of the Manila Police Department.</p>
<p>With regard to the appellee's lack of civil service qualifications, it is to 
be remarked that such lack does not necessarily mean that his appointment was 
temporary in character, considering that when appellee was appointed, Executive 
Order No. 264 was as yet in , force, and under its terms, positions of secret 
agent or detective were excepted from civil service requirements. The records of 
the case at bar, in fact, show that appellee Olegario's appointment was not 
temporary in character (Exhs. E to H).</p>
<p>We have held in Uy <em>vs</em>. Rodriguez, G. R. No. L-6772, July 30, 1954, 
that unless it is shown that a detective's appointment was temporary, he may not 
be dismissed except in accordance with Republic Act No. 557, and that ruling is 
decisive of this case.</p>
<p>'The question raised in this special civil action has already been decided 
squarely by Us in the cases of Palamine, et al. <em>vs</em>. Zagado, et al., G. 
R. No. L-6901, promulgated March 15, 1954; Mission, et al. <em>vs</em>. Del 
Rosario, G. R. No. L-6754, promulgated February 26, 1054; and Abella 
<em>vs</em>. Rodriguez, G. R. No. L-6897, promulgated June 29, 1954. In said 
cases, We have held that a member of the detective force of Cebu City is a 
member of the police department of said city and may not be removed except in 
accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 557.'</p>
<p>'The statement submitted by the petitioner shows that he is not a civil 
service eligible, but neither does it appear from the record that his 
appointment as member of the detective force was temporary in character or for 
period of three months merely, and that he had been reappointed every three 
months until bis separation. These circumstances in addition to the fact that he 
was promoted as senior detective inspector, show that his appointment is not in 
a temporary capacity. He may not, therefore, be . dismissed or removed except in 
accordance with the provisions of existing law.'</p>
<p>The difference between the present case and those involved in Orais 
<em>vs</em>. Ribo, 49 Off. Gaz. (12) 5386; Paña <em>vs</em>. Medina, 50 Off. 
Gaz. (1) 46, and Manigbas <em>vs</em>. De Guzman, G. R. No. L-6137, invoked by 
appellant, lies in that the present appellee was not appointed under section 682 
of the Administrative Code, but under the exceptional provisions of Executive 
Order No. 264, and Commonwealth Act No. 698, in force before Republic Act 557 
was enacted. Hence, said section 682 is inapplicable to him. The repeal of 
Commonwealth Act 698 by Republic Act 271 after he was appointed, could not 
retroact to the prejudiced of the appellee."</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, Olegario, the plaintiff in the case cited, is the same Detective 
Oscar Olegario, whose name is the fourth in the list of officers, including the 
petitioners herein—at the end of the letter of respondent mayor, quoted at the 
beginning of his decision who were dismissed from the Police Department of the 
City of Manila by virtue of said communication. Hence, respondent herein, who 
was the afame respondent in the Olegario case, admits that the doctrine laid 
down in Mission <em>vs</em>. Del Rosario, <em>supra</em>, upon which the 
decision in the Olegario case was predicated, is decisive in the case at bar, 
for which reason said respondent urges a reconsideration of the view expressed 
in the Mission case. However, the reasons given in support of respondent's 
pretense were already considered in disposing of the Olegario case and we are 
far from satisfied that the present case should be decided differently. Indeed, 
the decision in the Mission case merely followed the pattern set in Manuel vs. 
De la Fuente<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (48 Off. Gaz., 4829) and 
reiterated in Palamine <em>vs</em>. Zagado<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (50 Off. Gaz., 1566), Abella <em>vs</em>. 
Rodriguez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (50 Off. Gaz., 3039) and Uy 
<em>vs</em>. Rodriguez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (50 Off. Gaz., 
3574).</p>
<p>In fairness to respondent herein, it should be noted, however, that he acted 
as he did because of certain communications of the Commissioner of Civil 
Service, dated October 2, 1951 and May 2, 1952, expressing the opinion that 
detectives in the Manila Police Department hold primarily confidential positions 
from which they may be summarily dismissed, for lack of trust or confidence on 
the part of the appointing authority, and that said opinion was given, and the 
dismissal of petitioners herein took place, before the rendition of our 
decisions in the cases above referred to. Needless to say, these decisions must 
prevail over said opinion, regardless of its weight, from the administrative 
viewpoint, and of the good faith with which respondent herein had acted and of 
the commendable zeal which, obviously, animated him. At any rate, the 
reinstatement directed in the decision appealed from does not bar such 
appropriate administrative action as the behaviour of petitioners herein may 
warrant, upon compliance with the requirements of due process.</p>
<p>Wherefore, said decision is hereby affirmed, without special pronouncement as 
to costs. So ordered.</p>
