				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The Court of First Instance of Batangas sentenced appellant to <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em>, together with the accessory penalties provided by law, to 
indemnify the heirs of Gerundio Alcazar in the sum of P2,000, and to pay the 
costs, for the crime of murder committed in barrio Ba√±gin, Lemery, Batangas, on 
November 19, 1941.</p>
<p>According to three witnesses for the prosecution, Juan Mendoza, Irineo 
Sangalang, and Agripina Alcazar, at about 1 o'clock p. m., at a place near a 
fallen <em>siniguelas</em> tree, Alejandro Tolentino held with his left hand the 
rein of the horse Gerundio Alcazar was riding and with his right hand stabbed 
the latter with a pen knife. Alcazar fell down on the ground, the horse running 
away, and he was unable to stand up because he was again stabbed several times 
by the accused, who left him at the spot dead.</p>
<p>According to Irineo Sangalang, the motive for the crime was Gerundio 
Alcazar's being able to secure from his mother, Picola Landicho, permission to 
use a <em>madre cacao</em>, post in the building of his house to the disgust of 
the accused, who was married to his sister, Felisa Alcazar. When Gerundio began 
to cut the post, Tolentino told him: "Don't cut that <em>madre cacao</em> 
because I also need it." Gerundio answered: "I asked it from our mother and I 
have to cut it." The accused then said: "Don't cut it, otherwise something will 
happen." Gerundio was able to cut the post in August, 1941, and in September 
transferred it to another place.</p>
<p>Agripina Alcazar testified that at about six in the morning of November 19, 
1941, she saw accused sharpening his pen knife in the kitchen of her house. She 
asked him why he was sharpening it, and Tolentino answered; "leave me alone. You 
will know it before the afternoon."</p>
<p>Ruperta Balani declared that at 9a. m. of the same day, she had a 
conversation with the accused in an open lot of Barcelisa de Rojas in which 
Tolentino said: "Baguio would occur before the afternoon." Upon hearing this 
statement, Ignacio de Rojas asked him: "Are you, mayhap, God?" The accused did 
not answer directly, but only reiterated: "Before the afternoon arrives, 
something would happen."</p>
<p>When the trial in the lower court began on January 26, 1943, counsel for the 
defense announced that accused was willing to enter a plea of guilty if the 
fiscal would amend the information for murder by alleging only homicide. The 
private prosecution opposed the proposed amendment. The information was read to 
the accused who answered: "I plead guilty if it is for homicide, but if it is 
for the crime of murder I plead not guilty."</p>
<p>No evidence was presented by the accused as to how Gerundio Alcazar was 
killed other than his uncorroborated testimony. He declared that upon seeing 
him, Gerundio dismounted from his horse and stabbed him with his bolo. To avoid 
the attack, the accused ran away, but Gerundio pursued him and, cornered by a 
fence, accused then defended himself with a pen knife. In the ensuing struggle, 
both combatants fell down. Gerundio threw away his bolo and tried to wrest the 
pen knife from the hands of the accused. In the struggle Gerundio was wounded. 
When the accused left the place, he saw Gerundio falling. </p>
<p>Accused alleged that the motive of Gerundio in attacking him was Gerundio's 
opposition to his marriage with the sister of the deceased and the conflict 
concerning the <em>madre cacao</em>.</p>
<p>Accused's wife Felisa Alcazar also testified but only to support her 
husband's testimony concerning the motives the deceased had for nurturing ill 
feeling against the accused.</p>
<p>The testimony of the accused as to how Gerundio was killed can not prevail 
over the overwhelming evidence presented, by the prosecution. There is 
absolutely nothing in the record to show why the witnesses should falsely 
testify against the accused, specially when majority of them are his relatives. 
Even if it is true that Gerundio was not agreeable to the marriage of his sister 
with the accused, which took place sometime in 1936, it is unbelievable that his 
opposition to said marriage would induce him to bolo the accused five years 
thereafter,, or on November 19, 1941. The conflict about the <em>madre 
cacao</em> post, which the ccused ried to show as the reason that impelled the 
deceased to attempt the killing of his brother-in-law, rather corroborates the 
testimony of Irineo Sangalang to the effect that it was the accused who felt 
spited because Gerundio succeeded in cutting and in taking with him the 
<em>madre cacao</em> post, and who tried to stop the deceased from cutting it 
and warned him that something unuttered would happen if the deceased insisted in 
cutting it. Finally, the attitude of the accused himself in spontaneously and 
freely manifesting to the lower court his decided purpose to plead guilty, if he 
would only be charged with homicide, tends to create the belief that the accused 
himself is convinced that he is not blameless in the killing of his 
brother-in-law.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, the sentence of the lower court, being in accordance 
with the corresponding provisions of law (article 248 of the Revised Penal Code 
and Commonwealth Act No. 284), is affirmed, with costs against the appellant, 
whose motion for new trial for lack of merit, is denied.</p><em>Moran, C. J., 
Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</em> and <em>Tuason, JJ.</em>,

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>In consonance with my now well-known opinion on the question of validity or 
nullity or judgments and other judicial proceedings in cases heard and 
detarmined by the Japanese-sponsored courts during the Japanese occupation of 
the Philippines, I dissent from the foregoing opinion of the majority, without 
prejudice to the accused being prosecuted under and pursuant to tha laws and in 
the courts of this rightful government.</p>
