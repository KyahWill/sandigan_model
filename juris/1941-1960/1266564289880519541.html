Appeals holding petitioners Li Seng Giap, et al. liable for gift taxes in 
accordance with the assessments made by the respondent Collector of Internal 
Revenue.
<p>Petitioners Li Seng Giap (who died during the pendency of this appeal) and 
his wife Tang Ho and their thirteen children appear to be the stockholders of 
two close family corporations named Li Seng Giap &amp; Sons, Inc. and Li Seng 
Giap &amp; Co. On or about May, 1951, examiners of the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue, then detailed to the Alias Committee of the Congress of the 
Philippines, made an examination of the books of the two corporations 
aforementioned and found that each of Li Seng Giap's 13 children had a total 
investment therein of approximately P63,195.00, in shares issued to them by 
their father Li Seng Giap (who was the manager and controlling stockholder of 
the two corporations) in the years 1940, 1942, 1948, 1949, and 1950 in the 
following amounts:</p>

<p>The Collector of Internal Revenue regarded these transfers as undeclared 
gifts made in the respective years, and assessed against Li Seng Giap and h 
ischildren donor's and donee's taxes in the total amount of P76,985.31, 
including penalties, surcharges, interests, and compromise fee due to the 
delayed payment of the taxes. The petitioners paid the sum of P53,434.50, 
representing the amount of the basic taxes, and put up a surety bond to 
guarantee payment of the balance demanded. And on June 25, 1951, they requested 
the Collector of Internal Revenue for a revision of their tax assessments, and 
submitted donor's and donee's gift tax returns showing that each child received 
by way of gift <em>inter vivos</em>, every year from 1939 to 1950 (except in 
1947 and 1948) P4,000 in cash; that each of the eight children who married 
during the period aforesaid, were given an additional P20,000 as dowry or gift 
<em>propter nuptias</em>; that the unmarried children received roughly 
equivalent amounts in 1949, also by way of gifts <em>inter vivos</em>, so that 
the total donations made to each and every child, as of 1950, stood at P63,190. 
Appellants admit that these gifts were not reported; but contend that as the 
cash donated came from the conjugal funds, they constituted individual donations 
by each of the spouses Li Seng Giap and Tang Ho, of one-half of the amount 
received by the donees in each instance, up to a total of P31,505 to each of the 
thirteen children from each parent. They further alleged that the children's 
stockholdings in the two family corporations were purchased by them with savings 
from the aforesaid cash donations received from their parents.</p>
<p>Claiming the benefit of gift tax exemptions (under sections 110 and 112 of 
the Internal Revenue Code) at the rate of P2,000 a year for each donation, plus 
P10,000 for each gift <em>propter nuptias</em> made by either parent, the 
appellants' aggregate tax liability, according to their returns, would only be 
P4,599.94 for the year 1949, and P228.28 for the year 1950, or a total of 
P4,838.22, computed aa follows:</p>

<p>The Collector refused to revise his original assessments; and the petitioners 
appealed to the then Board of Tax Appeals (created by Executive Order 401-A, in 
1951) insisting that the entries in the books of the corporation do not prove 
donations; that the true amount and date of the donation were those appearing in 
their tax returns; and that the donees merely bought stocks in the corporation 
out of savings made from the money received from their parents. The Board of Tax 
Appeals upheld the decision of the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue; 
hence, this petition for review.</p>
<p>The questions in this appeal may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Whether or not the dates and amounts of the donations taxable against 
petitioners were as found by the Collector of Internal Revenue from the books of 
the corporations Li Seng Giap &amp; Sons, Inc. and Li Seng Giap &amp; Co., or as 
set forth in petitioners' gift tax returns;</p>
<p>(2) Whether or not the donations made by petitioner Li Seng Giap to his 
children from the conjugal property should be taxed against the husband alone, 
or against husband and wife; and</p>
<p>(3) Whether or not petitioners should be allowed the tax deductions claimed 
by them.</p>
<p>On the first question, which is of fact, the appellants take the preliminary 
stand that because the Collector failed to specifically deny the allegations of 
their petition in the Tax Board, he must be deemed to have admitted the annual 
and <em>propter nuptias</em> donations alleged by them, and that he is estopped 
from denying their existence. As the proceedings before the Tax Board were 
administrative in character, not governed by the Rules of Court (see Sec. 10, 
Executive Order 401-A), and as the Collector actually submitted his own version 
of the transactions, we do not consider that the Collector's failure to make 
specific denials should be given the same binding effect as in strict court 
pleadings.</p>
<p>Going now to the merits of the issue. The appealed findings of the Board of 
Tax Appeals and of the Collector of Internal Revenue (that the stock transfers 
from Li Seng Giap to his children were donations) appear supported by the 
following circumstances:</p>
<p>(1) That the transferor Li Seng Giap (now deceased) had in fact conveyed 
shares of stock to his 13 children on the dates and in the amounts shown in the 
table on page 2 of this decision.</p>
<p>(2) That none of the transferees appeared to possess adequate independent 
means to buy the shares, so much so that they claim now to have purchased the 
shares with the cash donations made to them from time to time.</p>
<p>(3) That the total of the alleged cash donations to each child is practically 
identical to the value of the shares supposedly purchased by each donee.</p>
<p>(4) That there is no evidence other than the belated sworn gift tax returns 
of the spouses Li Seng Giap and Ang Tang Ho, and their children, appellants 
herein, to support their contention that the shares were acquired by purchase. 
No contracts of sale or other documents were presented, nor any witnesses 
introduced; not even the claimants themselves have testified.</p>
<p>(5) The claim that the shares were acquired by the children by purchase was 
first advanced only after the assessment of gift taxes and penalties due thereon 
(in the sum of P76,995.31) had been made, and after the appellants had paid 
P53,434.50 on account, and had filed a bond to guarantee the balance.</p>
<p>(6) That for a parent to donate cash to enable the donee to buy from him 
shares of equivalent value is, for all intents and purposes, a donation of such 
shares to the purchaser donee.</p>
<p>We cannot say, under the circumstances, that there is no sufficient evidence 
on record to support the findings of the Tax Board that the stock transfers 
above indicated were made by way of donation, as would entitle us to disregard 
or reverse the Board's findings.</p>
<p>The filing of the gift tax returns only after assessment and part payment of 
the taxes demanded by the Collector, and the lack of corroboration of the 
alleged donations in cash, amply justify the Tax Board's distrust of the 
veracity of the appellants' belated tax returns. The Internal Revenue Code (C. 
A. 466 as amended) requires donors and donees to file gift tax returns "on or 
before the first of March followingfthe close of the calendar year" when the 
gifts were made (Sec. 115, par. [<em>c</em>]; and besides the return a written 
notice to the Collector of each donation of P10,000 or more, must be given 
within thirty days after the donation, Sec. 114). These yearly returns and 
notices are evidently designed to enable the Collector to verify promptly their 
truth and correctness, while the gifts are still recent and proof of the 
circumstances surrounding the making thereof is still fresh and accessible. On 
their own admission, appellants failed to file for ten successive years, the 
corresponding returns for the alleged yearly gifts of P4,000 to each child, and 
likewise failed to give the notices for the P20,000 marriage gifts to each 
married child. Hence, they are now scarcely in a position to complain if their 
contentions are not accepted as truthful without satisfactory corroboration. Any 
other view would leave the collection of taxes at the mercy of explanations 
concocted <em>ex post facto</em> by evading taxpayers, drafted to suit any facts 
disclosed upon investigation, and safe from contradiction because the passing 
years have erased all trace of the truth.</p>
<p>The second and third issues in this appeal revolve around appellants' thesis 
that inasmuch as the property donated was community property (gananciales), and 
such property is jointly owned by their parents, the total amount of the gifts 
made in each year should be divided between the father and the mother, as 
separate donors, and should be taxed separately to each one of them.</p>
<p>In assessing the worth of this contention, it must be ever borne in mind that 
appellants have not only failed to prove that the donations were actually made 
by both spouses, Li Seng Giap and Tang Ho, but that precisely the contrary 
appears from their own evidence. In the original claim for tax refund, filed 
with the Collector of Internal Revenue, under date of June 25, 1951 (copied in 
pages 6 and 7 of the appellants' petition for review addressed to the Board of 
Tax Appeals), the father, Li Seng Giap, describes himself as "the undersigned 
donor" (par. 1) and speaks of "cash donations made by the undersigned" (par. 3), 
without in any way mentioning his wife as a co-participant in the donation. The 
issue is thus reduced to the following: Is a donation of community property by 
the father alone equivalent in law to a donation of one-half of its value by the 
father and one-half by the mother ? Appellants submit that all such donations of 
community property are to be regarded, for tax purposes, as donations by both 
spouses, for which two separate exemptions may be claimed in each instance, one 
for each spouse.</p>
<p>This pretension should be viewed in the light of the provisions of the 
Spanish Civil Code of 1889, which was the governing law in the years herein 
involved, 1939 to 1950. The determinative rule is that of Arts. 1409 and 1415, 
reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 1409. The conjugal partnership shall also be chargeable with anything 
which may have been given or promised by the husband to the children born of the 
marriage solely in order to obtain employment for them or give them a 
profession, or by both spouses by common consent, should they not have 
stipulated that such expenditures should be borne in whole or in part by the 
separate property of one of them."</p>
<p>"Art. 1415, p. 1.—The husband may dispose of the property of the conjugal 
partnership for the purposes mentioned in Art. 1409."</p></blockquote>
<p>In effect, these Articles clearly refute the appellants' theory that because 
the property donated is community property, the donations should be viewed as 
made by both spouses. First, because fhe law clearly differentiates the 
donations of such property "by the husband" from the "donations by both spouses 
by common consent" ("por el marido ... o por ambos conyuges de coimin acuerdo," 
in the Spanish text).</p>
<p>Next, the wording of Arts. 1409 and 1415 indicates that the lawful donations 
by the husband to the common children are valid and are chargeable to the 
community property, irrespective of whether the wife agrees or objects thereto. 
Obviously, should the wife object to the donation, she can not be regarded as a 
donor at all.</p>
<p>Even more: Suppose that the husband should make a donation of some community 
property to a concubine or paramour. Undeniably, the wife cannot be regarded as 
joining in any such donation. Yet under the old Civil Code, the donation would 
stand, with the only limitation that the wife should not be prejudiced in the 
division of the profits after the conjugal partnership affairs are liquidated. 
So that if the value of the donation should be found to fit within the limits of 
the husband's ultimate share in the conjugal partnership profits, the donation 
by the husband would remain unassailable, over and against the nonparticipation 
of the wife therein. This Court has so ruled in Baello <em>vs</em>. Villanueva 
(54 Phil. 213, 214) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"According to article 1413 of the Civil Code, any transfer or agreement upon 
conjugal property made by the husband in contravention of its provisions, shall 
not prejudice his wife or her heirs. As the conjugal property belongs equally to 
husband and wife, the donation of this property made by the husband prejudices 
tbe wife in so far as it includes a part or the whole of the wife's half, and is 
to that extent invalid. Hence article 1419, in providing for the liquidation of 
the conjugal partnership, directs that all illegal donations made by the husband 
be charged against his estates and deducted from his capital. But it is only 
then, when the conjugal partnership is in the process of liquidation, that it 
can be discovered whether or not an illegal donation made by the husband 
prejudices the wife. And inasmuch as these gifts are only to be held invalid in 
so far as they prejudice the wife, their nullity cannot be decided until after 
the liquidation of the conjugal partnership and it is found that they encroach 
upon the wife's portion.'</p></blockquote>
<p>Appellants herein are therefore in error when they contend that it is enough 
that the property donated should belong to the conjugal partnership in order 
that the donation be considered and taxed as a donation of both husband and 
wife, even if the husband should appear as the sole donor. There is no blinking 
the fact that, under the old Civil Code, to be a donation by <em>both</em> 
spouses, taxable to both, the wife must <em>expressly</em> join the husband in 
making the gift; her participation therein cannot be implied.</p>
<p>It is true, as appellants stress, that in Gibbs <em>vs</em>. Government of 
the Philippines, 59 Phil., 293, this Court ruled that "the wife, upon 
acquisition of any conjugal property, becomes immediately vested with an 
interest and title equal to that of the husband"; but this Court was careful to 
immediately add, "subject to the power of management <em>and disposition</em> 
which the law vests on the husband." As has been shown, this power of 
disposition may, within the legal limits, override the objections of the wife 
and render the donation of the husband fully effective without need of the 
wife's joining therein. (Civil Code of 1889, Arts 1409, 1415.)</p>
<p>It becomes unnecessary to discuss the nature of a conjugal partnership, there 
being specific rules on donations of property belonging to it. The consequence 
of the husband's legal power to donate community property is that, where made by 
the husband alone, the donation is taxable as his own exclusive act. Hence, only 
one exemption or deduction can be claimed for every such gift, and not two, as 
claimed by appellants herein. In thus holding, the Board of Tax Appeals 
committed no error.</p>
<p>Premises considered, we are of the opinion and so declare:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) That the finding of the defunct Board of Tax Appeals to the 
effect that shares transferred from Li Seng Giap to his children were conveyed 
to them by way of donation <em>inter vivos</em> is supported by adequate 
evidence, and therefore cannot be reviewed by this Court (Comm. of Internal 
Revenue vs. Court Holding Co., L. Ed. 981; Comm. of Internal Revenue vs. 
Scottish American Investment Co., 89 L. Ed. 113; Comm. of Internal Revenue vs. 
Tower, 90 L. Ed. 670; Helvering vs. Tax Penn. Oil Co., 81 L. Ed. 755).</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) That under the old Civil Code, a donation by the husband alone 
does not become, in law a donation by both spouses merely because it involves 
property of the conjugal partnership;</p>
<p>(<em>c</em>) That such a donation of property belonging to the conjugal 
partnership, made during its existence, by the husband alone in favor of the 
common children, is taxable to him exclusively as sole donor.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is affirmed with costs to the 
appellants. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, 
Jugo, Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
