<blockquote>
  <p> "On November 28, 1947 a writ of execution of the
judgment just above quoted was issued by the Judge of the Municipal
Court of Rizal City. On June 23, 1948, in order to suspend execution of
said judgment issued on April 23, 1948, parties again entered into an
agreement, paragraph 6 of which reads as follows:</p>
  <p> '6. That
the Second Party, further agrees that his failure to comply with any of
the provisions of this agreement will be sufficient cause to order him
vacate the above-mentioned leased premises within fifteen (15) days
after having been served by the First Party with notice to that effect;
and if he fails to vacate the premises within such time to be specified
in the notice, First Party will revive the force and effect of the
judgment above-mentioned in which case the Second Party shall bear all
the expenses the First Party will incur in taking such action.'</p>
  <p>
"On November 2, 1948, parties entered into another agreement which was
duly approved by the court for the purpose of giving the defendant in
said case and petitioner herein until December 20, 1948 a chance to
comply with their agreement dated June 23, 1948 and upon their failure
to do so, the Judge of the Municipal Court of Rizal City issued the
following order:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 'On December 22, 1948,
the plaintiff filed a petition for the execution of the terms of the
amicable settlement of the parties dated June 23, 1948, as the
defendant failed to comply with the provisions of the same. The said
motion for execution was set for hearing on December 29, 1948, and
evidence was submitted by the parties to the effect that the defendant
has not complied with the aforesaid agreement, notwithstanding the
several opportunities given by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p> 'Wherefore,
the court finding the motion for execution of the plaintiff well
founded, the same is hereby granted. Let the corresponding writ of
execution be issued for the enforcement of the agreement entered into
by the parties dated June 28, 1948, and duly approved by the court.</p>
    <p> 'So ordered.</p>
    <p> 'Rizal City, January 8, 1949.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
"On motion of the plaintiff in said case and respondent in this
petition, the judge of the municipal court of Rizal City issued the
following order:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 'On February 9, 1949, the
plaintiff thru his attorney filed a petition for the demolition of the
house of the defendant situated on the land object of the complaint.
The court after hearing both parties, finds that said petition for
demolition is well founded;</p>
    <p> 'Wherefore, the Sheriff of
Rizal City is hereby ordered to demolish the house of the defendant
situated at 570 Harrison, Rizal City, without prejudice to the
collection of the rentals from the defendant due to the plaintiff for
the premises occupied by the defendant.</p>
    <p> 'So ordered.</p>
    <p> 'Rizal City, February 18, 1949.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
"In order to stop and prevent the execution of the last abovequoted
order, the defendant in said case and petitioner herein filed a
complaint in the Court of First Instance of said City on April 7, 1949,
known as Civil Case No. 813 of said court, asking, among other things
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction which was granted
upon deposit of a bond for P1,000, enjoining the defendants therein
from proceeding with said writ.</p>
  <p> "Issues having been joined
in said case and the same having been tried, the herein respondent Hon.
Bienvenido A. Tan, Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal City,
rendered his decision dismissing the case, with costs against the
plaintiff and ordered the lifting of the writ of preliminary
injunction, of which decision, dated October 3, 1949 notice was served
on October 19 on said plaintiff who, on November 10, filed a motion for
new trial which was denied on December 2. On December 20 counsel for
plaintiff petitioned for an extension of period for the filing of his
record on appeal and the respondent Judge granted said extension until
January 10, 1950.</p>
  <p> "On January 25, 1950, the respondent Judge issued the following order:</p>
  <p>
"The Record on Appeal presented in this case by the plaintiff will be
approved upon his filing a bond in the sum of P3,000, which amount will
be applied for the payment of the rents due on the premises.'</p>
  <p>
"On February 10, 1950, the plaintiff filed an urgent petition asking
for the fixing of a period within which the bond ordered to be posted
in the sum of P3.000 should be given and for the reduction of said bond
to P1,000. Nowhere in the record appears the action taken by the
respondent Judge on said urgent motion.</p>
  <p> "Said plaintiff on February 25, 1950, filed a petition for certiorarf, prohibition and mandamus in this Court. * * *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The main purpose of the petition is to have an order issued by the
Court of Appeals to compel the respondent Judge, Hon. Bienvenido A.
Tan, to approve the record on Appeal filed by the petitioner without
having to post the bond of P3,000 required by the judge in his order of
January 25, 1950. The order makes the approval of the record on appeal
dependent on the filing of the bond to be applied to the payment of the
rents due. The Court of Appeals found this requirement justifiable
under section 5, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, and denied the
petition; hence this appeal.</p>
<p> We do not agree to this view of the Court of Appeals. It should be
noted that the petition for certiorari filed in the Court of Appeals
had its origin in an unlawful detainer case filed in the municipal
court of Rizal City, which was submitted and decided on an agreed
statement of facts. This decision became final and a writ of execution
thereof was issued upon motion of the plaintiff. The execution was
however, suspended because of several compromise agreements entered
into between the parties to give to the defendant a chance to comply
with the original stipulation. But defendant again failed to live up to
his commitment and as a result the writ of execution was renewed.
Plaintiff went further than that. He asked the court to issue an order
for the demolition of the house of the defendant situated on the land
object of the complaint, which was granted, and to stop and prevent the
execution of this order the defendant filed a complaint in the Court of
First Instance of Rizal praying, among other things, that a writ of
preliminary injunction be issued enjoining the plaintiff from
proceeding with the writ of execution and the demolition of the house
of the defendant. Issues having been joined, and trial had, the court
rendered decision dismissing the case and ordering the lifting of the
writ of preliminary injunction. This decision, dated October 3,1949,
was served on October 19, on said plaintiff who, on November 10, filed
a motion for new trial which was denied on December 2. On December 20,
counsel for plaintiff asked for an extension of the period for filing
his record on appeal and the court granted an extension until January
10, 1950. However, on January 25, 1950, the court issued the disputed
order which required the plaintiff to put up a special bond of P3,000.</p>
<p> If civil case No. 813 instituted by the defendant, now petitioner,
has been dismissed, and a writ of preliminary injunction dissolved, as
above stated, and the judgment rendered in the case of unlawful
detainer is already final and executory, so much so that a writ of
execution has already been issued, and the court has ordered the
demolition of the house of the defendant, we find no plausible reason
nor justification for the action of the respondent judge in requiring
the plaintiff to post a bond of P3,000 as a condition precedent to the
approval of the record on appeal. As the records show, the main purpose
of said case is to question the legality of the lease contract entered
into between the parties which was allegedly executed in violation of
Republic Act No. 76, known as the Rental Law, although incidentally
plaintiff asked for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.
But this case was dismissed and the injunction dissolved, with the
natural result that the defendant found himself free to enforce and
carry out the writ of execution issued in the detainer case. There was,
therefore, no need for requiring the plaintiff to post a special bond
to perfect his appeal from the decision. Nor can that bond be
considered a <em>supersedeas</em> bond because the purpose of the
latter is "to stay an execution or other final process on the judgment"
(Moran, Com. on the Rules of Court, Vol. I, p. 820). Here, there is no
judgment to stay because the case was dismissed. The writ of injunction
was dissolved and the defendant was free to enforce the writ of
execution in the detainer case. Section 5, Rule 41 of the Rules of
Court, which the Court of Appeals invoked to justify the action of the
respondent judge has, therefore, been misapplied. The respondent judge
should have approved the record on appeal with the usual bond of P60
which is the only one justified by the nature of the case. To require a
further bond, as was done in this case, constitutes an abuse of
discretion.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby reversed.
Let a writ of mandamus issue as prayed for by the petitioner.</p>
<p> <em>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Reyes </em>and<em> Jugo, JJ.,</em> concur.</p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">

    </strong><em>DISSENTING AND CONCURRING </em><strong>
    </strong></p><p>
<strong><strong>FERIA</strong>, <em>J.,:</em></strong></p><p>This is an appeal by certiorari from the decision of the
Court of Appeals which denied the petition for mandamus filed by the
appellant against respondent Judge Bienvenido A. Tan of the Court of
First Instance of Rizal, which required the appellant a bond of P3,000
before approving the record on Appeal filed by the appellant from an
order of the said court dismissing his action filed in case No. 813 of
said court and dissolving the writ of preliminary injunction issued in
said case.</p>
<p> The action filed in said case No. 813 is an action for
injunction or in which the whole or part of the relief demanded
consists in restraining the execution of an order or judgment rendered
against the herein appellant in another case, and for that reason the
Court of First Instance of Rizal had issued a writ of preliminary
injunction in said action. Because according to section 3 of Rule 60,
"a preliminary injunction may be granted at any time after the
commencement of the action and before judgment, when it is established
(among others) that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded
and the whole or part of the relief consist in restraining the
commission or continuance of the act complained of for a limited period
or perpetually."</p>
<p>Under section 4, Rule 39, in an action for injunction, the
final judgment or order granting, dissolving or denying the injunction,
shall not be stayed after its rendition and before the appeal is taken
or during the pendency of an appeal. "The trial court, however, in its
discretion, when an appeal is taken for a judgment granting,
dissolving, or denying an injunction may make an order suspending,
modifying restoring or granting such injunction during the pendency of
the appeal," upon petition of the interested party who shall be
required to put up "a bond under such terms and conditions as it may
consider proper for the security of the right of the adverse party."</p>
<p>&lt; As an appeal from the order dismissing the appellant's
action and dissolving the preliminary injunction issued in the Case No.
813 would not stay the execution of said order dissolving the
injunction, which is final and executory after its rendition, the trial
court acted in excess of its jurisdiction in requiring the appellant to
file a bond of P3,000.00 for the perfection of his appeal. And the
Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the trial judge or court did
not act in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion
in requiring said bond of P3,000 before approving the Record on Appeal
filed by the appellant in said case No, 813.</p><p> The amount of three thousand (P3,000) pesos required as
bond by the trial court can hot be considered as appeal bond under
section 5, Rule 41, of the Rules of Court. Because under said section
5, "the appeal bond shall be in the amount of sixty (P60) pesos unless
the court shall fix a different amount," and "is conditioned for the
payment of costs which the appellate court may award against the
appellant"; and as section 3 of Rule 131 provides that "when an action
or an appeal is found to be frivolous, double or treble costs may be
imposed on the appellant," it is obvious that the maximum amount of
appeal bond which may be fixed by the court cannot exceed three times
the sum of P60 fixed by said section 5, Rule 41.</p><p> And the trial court had no power to require said bond of
three thousand (P3,000) pesos as a supersedeas bond, because the appeal
filed by the appellant from the order dismissing the complaint and
dissolving the preliminary injunction issued in the case No. 813, did
not stay the execution of said order or the dissolution of the
injunction. Had the appellant filed a petition for the restoration
during the pendency of his appeal of the injunction dissolved, then and
only then could the trial court, in granting such petition, require the
petitioner, under the provisions of section 4 of Rule 39, to file a
bond upon such terms as it might consider proper for the security of
the rights of the adverse party.</p><p> Therefore I concur in the dispositive part of the decision of the majority for the reasons or on the grounds above set forth.</p>
