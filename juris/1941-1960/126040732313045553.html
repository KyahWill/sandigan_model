				<H3>LORENZO B. FAJARDO, PETITIONER, VS.  HONORABLE  FROILAN BAYONA,  JUDGE  OF THE  COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE  OF MANILA, AND ESTER TOLOSA DE FAJARDO, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a petition for certiorari and mandamus to compel&nbsp; the Judge&nbsp; Froilan Bayona&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila to give course to an appeal presented by petitioner against&nbsp; the court's order denying&nbsp; petitioner's application for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court. The record discloses&nbsp; that&nbsp; the following&nbsp; proceedings have taken place before the&nbsp; respondent judge:<br><br>In civil case&nbsp; No. 12435&nbsp; of the respondent&nbsp; court entitled "Lorenzo B.&nbsp; Fajardo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.&nbsp;</span> Ester Tolosa&nbsp; de Fajardo",&nbsp; decision was rendered on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1953 in&nbsp; favor of defendant dismissing&nbsp; plaintiff's complaint.&nbsp; Plaintiff Fajardo tried to perfect.an&nbsp; appeal from said judgment&nbsp; but failed to.present the record on appeal within the period 'fixed by the&nbsp; trial court, for which reason the&nbsp; appeal was declared abandoned and the appeal dismissed.&nbsp; This&nbsp; order is dated January 9, 1954.&nbsp; Three&nbsp; days before the&nbsp; dismissal of this appeal, that is on January 6, 1954, Fajardo filed a&nbsp; petition for relief under Rule&nbsp; 38 of the Rules, alleging that he did not have sufficient time to present the amended record on appeal within the time fixed&nbsp; by the court, because he left Manila&nbsp; for Jolo&nbsp; on December 31, 1953 and did not come back until January 6, 1954,, after the period for&nbsp; the&nbsp; presentation&nbsp; of the amended&nbsp; record on appeal had expired.&nbsp; It is also alleged in the petition that counsel&nbsp; could not have prepared the amended record on, appeal in time as it was voluminous, consisting of 117 pages, and the period granted for the presentation of the amended record on appeal was only five (5) days, too short a period for him for its preparation. Opposition&nbsp; to this petition (for relief)&nbsp; was presented&nbsp; on&nbsp; three&nbsp; grounds, namely, plaintiff's negligence was inexcusable;&nbsp; plaintiff's counsel is guilty of laches; and plaintiff is barred from filing the petition for relief because he had presented a petition with the Supreme Court to compel the judge to give course to the appeal he had tried to perfect but which petition was denied, and that he is therefore, prohibited from&nbsp; seeking relief under Rule&nbsp; 88 of the&nbsp; Rules.&nbsp; The trial judge sustained this last objection on&nbsp; the strength of our ruling in the case of Palomares vs. Jimenez <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span>, G.&nbsp; R. No. Lr-4513,&nbsp; promulgated January 31, 1952. In connection with the previous&nbsp; attempt&nbsp; of petitioner to&nbsp; appeal from the judgment,&nbsp; it is worthy to note that the petition for .mandamus was filed with us, but we dismissed the petition on&nbsp; January 12, 1954&nbsp; "without prejudice&nbsp; to the filing&nbsp; of the proper action in the Court of Appeals, the remedy being in aid&nbsp; of&nbsp; its appellate jurisdiction."&nbsp; On presenting the petition for mandamus in the Court&nbsp; of Appeals, this court also denied the petition on&nbsp; February 9, 1954.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Reply Memorandum, pp. 2-3.)<br><br>The question&nbsp; now before us&nbsp; is, was&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; barred by his previous attempt to appeal through a petition for certiorari and mandamus instituted in the Court of Appeals, which&nbsp; attempt, however, was&nbsp; unsuccessful, or may petitioner&nbsp; obtain the same end by first&nbsp; presenting a petition for relief under Rule 38 of the Rules and&nbsp; then&nbsp; appealing from the order denying said petition?&nbsp; One of the most important&nbsp; principles underlying&nbsp; our rules of procedure is that denying multiplicity of&nbsp; suits or remedies.&nbsp; When a litigant comes before a&nbsp; court of justice all causes of action or matters&nbsp; of&nbsp; defense arising out&nbsp; of&nbsp; or&nbsp; related&nbsp; to&nbsp; the controversy must be joined by him in the action or defense and&nbsp; he may not again bring up the said matters in a subsequent&nbsp; action&nbsp; or&nbsp; proceeding, whether&nbsp; or&nbsp; not! said matters were set forth and litigated in&nbsp; the previous suit. The&nbsp; purpose and aim of the principle is to have controversies and the&nbsp; matters directly related&nbsp; thereto&nbsp; settled once and&nbsp; for all&nbsp; once they are brought to&nbsp; the courts&nbsp; for determination.&nbsp; Litigation is costly&nbsp; both to&nbsp; litigants&nbsp; and to the&nbsp; State, and the objective of procedure is&nbsp; limit its number or extent.&nbsp; In consonance with the above principle, we&nbsp; have the rules&nbsp; against multiplicity&nbsp; of&nbsp; suits,&nbsp; the rule of estoppel by judgment (section 44, Rule 39), and&nbsp; the rule&nbsp; of res judicata (section 45, Rule 39).&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also provided&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Rules that the&nbsp; special civil&nbsp; actions of certiorari,&nbsp; prohibition and mandamus can only be availed of if there is no&nbsp; other&nbsp; plain, speedy&nbsp; and adequate remedy in the ordinary&nbsp; course of law&nbsp; (Sees.&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 2 and 3, Rule 67).&nbsp; So also with&nbsp; respect to motions.&nbsp; Provision is made that a motion&nbsp; attacking a pleading or proceeding shall include all objections then available and&nbsp; that all objections not so&nbsp; included are waived (section&nbsp; 8, Rule 26).&nbsp;&nbsp; And in connection with&nbsp; pleadings,&nbsp; defenses and&nbsp; objections&nbsp; not raised&nbsp; are deemed&nbsp; waived&nbsp; (section . 10, Rule 9).&nbsp;&nbsp; With these principles and&nbsp; provisions in mind one can not&nbsp; fail to understand that in the&nbsp; case at bar the presentation of the petition for relief under Rule 38, for the purpose of securing an appeal from the judgment,&nbsp; should not be allowed petitioner&nbsp; again because&nbsp; he already had the&nbsp; opportunity to prosecute&nbsp; or&nbsp; compel&nbsp; the&nbsp; allowance&nbsp; of&nbsp; his appeal from the judgment, when he&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; the action of certiorari&nbsp; and mandamus against the judge who&nbsp; had refused to&nbsp; approve his record on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such was the import&nbsp; of&nbsp; our&nbsp; ruling in&nbsp; Palomares <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Jimenez, Supra. This ruling is supported by competent authority.<br><blockquote>"Except where such remedies are cumulative under&nbsp; the governing statutes, a motion to vacate or set aside a Judgment will not be entertained&nbsp; when the proper remedy&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; party aggrieved is by appeal, error, or certiorari, * * *"&nbsp; (49&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J. S.&nbsp; p. 511.)<br></blockquote>The remedy first pursued by petitioner when he&nbsp; tried to have his appeal admitted was. a remedy at law. ,&nbsp; That which he subsequently pursued when he sought&nbsp; relief was a&nbsp; remedy in&nbsp; equity.&nbsp; It has been held a vicious practice indeed for a party first to pursue a legal remedy and&nbsp; later abandon it and prosecute that in equity.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Mellerio&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Freeman, 211 Pa. 202, 60 Atl. 735).&nbsp;&nbsp; There will.be no end to litigation were parties&nbsp; allowed to avail&nbsp; of all&nbsp; remedies one after another.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we said the remedy under Rule 38 is&nbsp; to&nbsp; be availed of only in exceptional&nbsp; cases, and where there&nbsp; is other remedy at law,&nbsp; it should&nbsp; not be allowed to&nbsp; be used&nbsp; (Palomares<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Jimenez, supra).<br><br>But there is another potent reason&nbsp; why the appeal&nbsp; must be denied and the order appealed from affirmed.&nbsp; Appellant Fajardo&nbsp; would&nbsp; not&nbsp; profit by the allowance of&nbsp; his appeal,&nbsp; even if his appeal&nbsp; against the order, were allowed. His motion for relief is accompanied&nbsp; by an affidavit which counsel gave the title of "affidavit of merit."&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; examining this&nbsp; affidavit, one&nbsp; will find that it is not the affidavit of merits that Rule 38 requires.&nbsp; It is an affidavit supporting counsel's excusable&nbsp; negligence, not an affidavit that petitioner Fajardo has a meritorious cause&nbsp; of action. As a matter of fact, neither his petition in the court below nor his petition in this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; contains any allegation or claim that he has a&nbsp; good&nbsp; or meritorious cause of action against the respondent.&nbsp; Neither is his complaint attached&nbsp; to his petition&nbsp; in the court below or in this Court.&nbsp; In Paher, <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Yatco, et al., 48 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 59, we held through Mr. Justice Montemayor:<br><blockquote>"* * *, but&nbsp; when it is very evident as shown&nbsp; by&nbsp; the facts&nbsp; of the case that the granting of the writ would not profit the petitioner to obtain&nbsp; said remedy,&nbsp; for&nbsp; like&nbsp; a&nbsp; mirage it would&nbsp; merely raise false hopes and in the end avail the petitioner nothing, said petition for mandamus will be dismissed."&nbsp; (Syllabus.)<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; denied with costs&nbsp; against the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> 90 Phil., 778.</div>
