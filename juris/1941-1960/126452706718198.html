  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>HILADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Petitioner Haydee  Herras Teehankee is a political  detainee delivered by the Counter Intelligence Corps, United States Army, to the Commonwealth Government, pursuant to the Proclamation of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, dated December 29, 1944.   She was one  of  the petitioners in  case  No. L-44, "Raquiza <em>vs.</em> Bradford," of this court  (p. 50, <em>ante</em>).  She  is  now  confined in  the Correctional Institution  for  Women under the custody of the Commonwealth Government since October, 1945, when she was thus delivered to  the said government.</p>
<p>Under  date  of October 2, 1945, petitioner, through her husband,  Alberto Teehankee, filed with the People's Court a petition wherein, invoking the  provisions  of  Executive Order No. 65, promulgated  by His Excellency,  the  President of  the Philippines, dated  September 3,  1945, she prayed  that her  immediate  release  be ordered  on the ground  that no evidence exists upon which she could be charged with any act punishable by law, or, alternatively, that the People's Court fix the bail for her  provisional liberty, in conformity with the aforesaid executive order, and upon approval of such bail, that an order be forthwith issued directing the officer having official custody of her person to immediately release her.</p>
<p>On October 4, 1945, the Hon. Antonio Quirino, one of the Associate Judges of the People's Court,  upon considering the said petition, required the Solicitor General "to file his comment and recommendation as soon as  possible."</p>
<p>On October 5, 1945, the Solicitor General filed recommendation in compliance with said order, stating:  "that on the strength of the  evidence  at hand,  the reasonable bail  recommended for the provisional release of the petitioner be fixed at Fifty Thousand Pesos  (P50.000)."</p>
<p>On October 9, 1945, the Hon. Leopoldo Rovira, Presiding Judge of  the People's Court, entered  an order referring the petition for provisional release above mentioned for consideration by the Fifth Division of said Court, but adding the following statement:  "in my opinion, it should be denied notwithstanding the recommendation of the  Solicitor General for her provisional release under a bond of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000)."</p>
<p>On the same date, October 9, 1945, the  Hon. Pompeyo Diaz, Associate Judge of said Court, entered an order disposing of said petition and denying the same "in view of the gravity of the offense  as can be deduced from  the fact that the office of the Special Prosecutors recommends as high as  Fifty Thousand Pesos  (50,000) for her provisional release." A motion having been filed by petitioner with the People's Court praying said  court to  reconsider  its order of October 9, 1945, denying her petition for provisional release, the Court, through Associate Judge Pompeyo Diaz, denied said motion.</p>
<p>In her  present petition for the writs of certiorari and mandamus originally filed with this Court  on October 19, 1945, petitioner avers that the above-mentioned Judges of the People's Court, in denying her petition  for  provisional liberty under bail, as well as her motion for reconsideration, acted  in excess  of jurisdiction and with grave  abuse  of discretion.  Paragraph  VII of this  petition  contains her allegations in support of this charge.</p>
<p>Under date of October 21, 1945, respondent Judge Pompeyo Diaz  filed his answer stating that the order denying bail "was issued  under express mandate of the law", citing section 19  of Commonwealth Act No. 682.</p>
<p>Article  III, section 1  (16)  of the Commonwealth Constitution provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All persons shall before conviction be bailable by sufficient  sureties,  except  those charged  with capital offenses  when  evidence of guilt is  strong.  Kxcessive bail shall not  be required." Rule 110 of  the Rules of Court provides in the following sections:</p>
  <p>"SEC.  3. <em>Offenses less than capital before conviction by the Court of First Instance.</em>—After judgment by a justice of the peace and before conviction by the Court of First Instance, the defendant shall be admitted to bail as of right.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  4. <em>Noncapital offenses after conviction by the Court of First Instance.</em>—After conviction  by the  Court  of First  Instance, defendant may, upon application, be bailed at the discretion of the court.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  5. <em>Capital offenses  defined.</em>—A  capital offense,  as the  term is  used in this rule, is an offense which, under the law existing at the time of its commission,  and at  the time of the application to be admitted to bail, may be punished by death.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  6. <em>Capital  offense not bailable.</em>—No  person  in custody for the commission of a capital  offense  shall be admitted to bail if the evidence of his guilt is strong.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  7. <em>Capital offenses-burden  of proof.</em>—On the hearing of  an application for admission to bail made by any person who is in custody for the commission of  a capital offense, the burden of showing that evidence of guilt is strong is on the prosecution.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  8. <em>Notice of application  to fiscal.</em>—When  admission to  bail is  a matter of  discretion, the court must require that reasonable notice of the hearing  of the application for bail be  given to the fiscal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section  66 of General Orders, No. 58 stipulates:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When admission  to bail is a matter of discretion, the court must require that reasonable notice of the hearing of the application for bail be given to  the <em>promotor fiscal.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section  19 of  Commonwealth Act No.  682 contains  the following  proviso:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  19.  * *  *  <em>Provided, however,</em> That existing  provisions of law to the  contrary notwithstanding, the aforesaid political prisoners may, in the discretion  of the People's Court, after due notice to the office of Special Prosecutors and hearing, be released on bail, even prior  to the  presentation  of  the  corresponding  information, unless the Court finds that there is  strong evidence of the commission of a capital offense.  *  *   *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section  22 of Commonwealth  Act No. 682 ordains:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  22. The prosecution, trial and disposal of cases before the People's Court shall be governed by existing laws and rules of court, unless otherwise expressly provided  herein  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Against the petitioner herein no information  had  yet been presented when she filed  her petition dated October 2, 1945, containing the alternative prayer for the fixing of bail for her provisional liberty.  She there invokes Executive Order No. 65 of the  President of  the Philippines, dated September 3, 1945.  The proviso above quoted from section 19 of the People's Court Act (Commonwealth Act No. 682) also  existed in the statute books at the time.</p>
<p>The able arguments adduced  on both sides have received the most  careful consideration  of the Court as befits  the importance of the  questions involved.  However, in  the view we take of the case,  a majority of the Court are of opinion that the  only questions calling for  decision at this time are:  (1) whether Article III, section 1(16)  of  the Commonwealth  Constitution is applicable  to the  instant case; (2) whether a hearing should be held of the application for bail with the attendance of the petitioner and the Solicitor General or the latter's representative; and  (3)  if so, what kind of hearing it should be.</p><ol><li> As to the first question, we hold that Article III, section 1(16) of the Commonwealth Constitution is applicable to  the  instant case.  This constitutional mandate  refers to <em>all persons</em>, not only to persons against whom a complaint or  information has already  been formally filed.   It lays down the rule that all persons shall before conviction be bailable except those charged with capital offenses when evidence of guilt is strong.  According to this provision, the general  rule is that any person, before being convicted of any  criminal offense, shall be bailable, except when he is charged with a capital  offense and  the evidence  of his guilt is strong.   Of course, only those persons who have been either arrested,  detained  or otherwise  deprived of their liberty will ever have occasion to seek the benefits of said provision.   But in order that a person can invoke this constitutional precept, it is not necessary  that he should wait until a formal complaint or information is filed against him.  From the moment he is placed under arrest,  detention or restraint by the officers of the law, he can claim this guarantee of the Bill  of Rights, and this right  he retains unless and until he is charged with a capital offense and evidence of his guilt is strong.   Indeed if, as admitted on all sides, the precept protects those already charged under a formal complaint or information, there seems to be no legal or  just reason for denying its benefits to one as against whom the  proper authorities  may even yet conclude that there exists no  sufficient evidence of guilt.  To place the former in a more favored position than the latter would be, to say the least, anomalous and absurd.   If there is a presumption of innocence in favor of one already formally charged  with  criminal  offense  (Constitution,  Article III, section 1 [17], <em>a fortiori</em>, this  presumption should be indulged in favor of one  not yet  so charged,  although already arrested or detained.<p></p>
<p>In Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 7th edition, pages 436-438,  we read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Perhaps the most important of the protections to personal liberty consists in  the mode of trial which is secured to every person accused of crime.   At the common law, accusations of f«lony were made in the form of an indictment  by a grand jury; and this process is still retained in many of the States, while others have  substituted in its stead an information  filed  by the  prosecuting officer of the State or county. Th§ mode of investigating the facts, however, is the  same in all; and this is through a trial by jury, surrounded  by  certain safeguards  which are a well-understood part  of  the  system,  and which  the  government cannot dispense with.</p>
  <p>"First, we may  mention that the  humanity of our law  always presumes an accused  party innocent until he is proved to be guilty. This is a presumption  which attends all the  proceedings against him, from  their initiation  until they result in  a verdict, which either finds the party guilty  or converts  the presumption  of innocence into an adjudged fact.</p>
  <p>"If there were any mode short  of  confinement which would,  with reasonable  certainty, insure the attendance of the accused to  answer the accusation, it would not be justifiable to inflict  upon him that indignity,  when  the effect  is  to subject him, in a greater  or less degree, to the punishment  of a guilty person, while as  yet it is not determined that he  has committed  any crime.  If the punishment on conviction cannot exceed in severity  the forfeiture of a  large sum of money, then it is reasonable to suppose that such a sum of money, or an agreement by responsible parties to pay it to the government in case the accused  should fail to appear, would be  sufficient security for his attendance; and therefore, at the common  law, it was customary to take security of this character in all cases of misdemeanor • one or more friends of the accused undertaking for his appearance for trial, and agreeing that a certain  sum of money should be levied of their goods and chattels, lands and tenements, if he made default. But in the case of  felonies, the privilege of giving bail before  trial was not a matter of right;  and in this country, although tfie criminal code is much more merciful than it formerly was in England, and in some cases the allowance of bail is almost a matter of course, there are others  in ¦which it is discretionary with the magistrate to allow it or not,  and where it will sometimes be  refused if the evidence of guilty is strong or the presumption great.  Capital offenses are not generally regarded as bailable; at least, after indictment, or when the party is charged  by the finding of a  coroner's jury;  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that Justice  Cooley  says in the foregoing quotations regarding the humanity of the law  in his jurisdiction and its presumption that an accused party is innocent until he is proved to be guilty, is distinctly true also in ours where the constitutional,  statutory,  and reglementary provisions on the point have been borrowed from America.  The same should be said  of what he  says regarding the granting of bail for provisional liberty before conviction, and even after,  in  exceptional  cases,  of  course,  always  subject to the limitations established by our own Constitution, laws, and  rules of court.  From  the  last  part  of said quotation  it follows, firstly, that before indictment or charge by the coroner's jury, in trie jurisdiction to which  the author refers, there  may  be cases  in  which even a capital offense is bailable,  and, secondly, that even after indictment or the finding of  a coroner's jury  in  these jurisdictions, there may be exceptional  cases where a capital offense is still  bailable.  Under our  Constitution, as we have seen, all offenses are  bailable before  conviction  except capital offenses when evidence  of guilt is strong.   In consonance with this constitutional  provision, section 3 of Rule  HO of the Rules of Court stipulates that non-capital offenses before conviction  by the  Court of First Instance shall be bailable as of right;  section 4 of the same Rule provides that after conviction  by the Court of First Instance such offenses may, upon application, be  bailable at the discretion  of the court;  and section 6  of  the said Rule provides that "no person in custody for the commission of a capital offense shall be admitted to bail if the evidence of his guilt is strong."</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"By the  common law, all offenses including treason, murder, and other felonies,  were bailable<em> before indictment  found</em>, although the granting or refusing  of such bail in case of capital offenses was a matter within the discretion of the  court."  (6  C. J., 958;<em> italics</em> supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p></li><li>As to  the second  question, we hold that  upon application  by a political prisoner or detainee to the People's Court for provisional release  under bail, a hearing, summary or otherwise, should be held with due notice to the Office of Special Prosecutors, as well as to the prisoner or detainee.  It will be remembered that  section 22  of the People's Court Act subjects the  prosecution, trial, and disposal of cases before the People's Court to "existing  laws and rules of court," unless otherwise expressly provided in said act.  Consequently,  the hearing and disposal  of application for bail for provisional release before  the People's Court should be governed by existing laws and rules of court, the hearing and disposal  of such  applications being a mere part of the "prosecution, trial, and disposal"  of the corresponding cases  before said court.  If attention should  be directed to the clause "unless otherwise expressly provided herein" in said section 22, in connection with the first proviso of section 19 of the same act, it should  be borne in mind that the provisions of said act should  be construed in harmony with those of the Constitution, under  the well-settled rule of  statutory  construction  that legislative enactments should be construed, wherever possible, in a manner that would avoid their conflicting  with the fundamental law.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li>As to  the third question.  While  it is true that the Solicitor General  on October 3, 1945, recommended Fifty Thousand Pesos  (P50,000)  as a reasonable bail "on the strength of  the  evidence at hand,"  it  may happen  that thereafter his office may have secured additional evidence which,  in addition  to or in  connection with  that  he already possessed,  in his  opinion is sufficiently strong  to prove petitioner's  guilt for a capital  offense, in which case, he may yet  decide to oppose the application for bail heretofore filed  by the petitioner at the hearing thereof hereinafter ordered.  It will be remembered that  petitioner, while under the custody of the Counter Intelligence Corps, United States Army, was charged  with (<em>a</em>)  "Active collaboration with the Japanese"  and  (<em>b</em>) "Previous association with the enemy" (Raquiza <em>vs</em>. Bradford, p. 50, ante). Under the definition of treason in the Revised Penal Code, active collaboration with the Japanese and association with them  during  the  war  in the  Philippines may  constitute treason, a capital  offense.
  <p></p></li></ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>"ART. 114. Any person who, owing allegiance to the United States or the Government of the Philippine Islands, not being a foreigner, * *  *  adheres to their enemies, giving them aid or comfort within the Philippine Islands or elsewhere, shall be punished by <em>reclusion temporal</em> to death and  shall pay a fine not to exceed 20,000 pesos." (Revised Penal Code.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it may also  happen that, either because no such further evidence has come into his possession or because, in his judgment, the public interest would be better served  by his withholding the  evidence that he has until the trial in  the merits,  he would prefer not to oppose the application for bail.   At the hearing of the application the Solicitor General will be  free to adopt one course or  the other.  If he opposes, the burden of proof will be on him to show that petitioner is not entitled to  bail.   Petitioner will have  the  right to  offer  evidence  to  prove her  right thereto.   In fine, the hearing is for the purpose of enabling the People's Court to exercise  its sound  discretion as to whether or not under the Constitution and laws in force petitioner  is entitled to  provisional release under bail.</p>
<p>Wherefore, it is the judgment of this Court that: (<em>a</em>) the order of the People's Court, dated October 9, 1945, denying petitioner's petition for provisional release  under bail, and the order of said Court, dated October 13, 1945, denying petitioner's motion  for reconsideration of  said order of October 9, 1945, which we  declare to have been entered with grave abuse of discretion, be set aside; and (b) that for the proper application of the pertinent constitutional, statutory, and reglementary provisions alluded to in the body of this decision, a hearing of petitioner's application for bail be held before the People's Court with due notice to the Solicitor General, as  well  as  to the petitioner,  as hereinabove outlined, said  hearing, whether summary  or otherwise, to  be  such as would enable the People's Court to exercise its sound discretion in the disposal of the aforesaid petition.  Without costs.  So ordered.</p>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING  AND DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>OZAETA, PARAS,</strong> and <strong>PERFECTO, JJ.,</strong></p>
<p>We concur in the opinion prepared by Mr. Justice Hilado in so far as it holds that subsections (16) and (17), section 1, Article III of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[a]</sup> are  applicable to the instant case; and that  the Rules  of Court, particularly sections 3 to 8 of Rule 110, govern the procedure in the People's Court as to applications for bail under the first proviso of section  19 of Commonwealth  Act No.  682.</p>
<p>But we are constrained to dissent from said  opinion and its dispositive  part  in so far as the Court fails to  enforce and  give practical effect to the said constitutional provisions in the  present case, with  the lamentable result that the herein petitioner, who has been confined in prison for about ten months without any formal  charge having been filed against  her, but  who under said  constitutional provisions and the  Rules of Court cited is clearly entitled to be forthwith released  on bail, will have to undergo further unnecessary delay to secure  her  provisional liberty.</p>
<p>We shall briefly express our conception of the force and effect of the mandatory provision of  the Constitution on the admission to bail of  all  persons before  conviction  as applied to the undisputed facts of this case:</p>
<p>The main  question involved herein is the interpretation of the second proviso of section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 682,  which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Provided, however,</em> That existing provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the  aforesaid political  prisoners may, in the discretion  of the People's Court,  after due notice to the Office of Special Prosecutors and hearing, be released  on  bail, even prior to the presentation of the corresponding information, unless the Court finds that  there is  strong evidence of the commission of a  capital offense."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This  statutory provision  must  be  construed  congruently with  the provision  of  the  Constitution and  in harmony with the  existing laws on the subject, particularly sections 3 to 8 of Rule 110 of the  Rules of  Courts. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[b]</sup></p>
<p>Subsection (16), section  1 of Article III of the  Constitution provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(16) All persons <em>shall</em> before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties,  except those charged with capital offenses when  evidence of guilt is strong.   Excessive bail shall not be required."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rule  110 of  the Rules of Court contains the following provisions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC.  3. <em>Offenses less than capital before conviction of the Court of First Instance.</em>—After judgment by a justice of the peace and before conviction by the  Court  of  First Instance, the defendant  shall be admitted to  bail as of right.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  4. <em>Noncapital offenses after conviction by the Court of First Instance.</em>—After conviction by the Court of First Instance, defendant may, upon application, be bailed at  the discretion  of the court.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  5.<em> Capital offenses defined.</em>—A capital offense, as the  term ia used in this rule, is an offense which, under the law existing at the time of its commission,  and at the  time  of the application to be admitted  to bail, may  be  punished by death.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  6.<em> Capital  offense not bailable.</em>—No person in custody for the commission of a  capital offense  shall be admitted to bail if the evidence of his guilt is strong.</p>
  <p>"SEC.  7.<em> Capital  offense—burden of proof.</em>—On the hearing of an application  for admission  to bail made by any  person who is in custody for the commission of a capital offense, the burden of showing that evidence of guilt is strong is on the prosecution.</p>
  <p>"SEC. 8.<em> Notice of application  to fiscal.</em>—When admission to bail is a matter of discretion, the court must require  that reasonable notice of the hearing1 of the application for bail be given to the fiscal."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In accordance with  section 2  of said Commonwealth Act No. 682, the political  prisoners subject  to the  jurisdiction of the People's  Court  may be accused of any of  the crime against  national security, to wit,  (1)  treason,  (2) conspiracy, and proposal to commit treason,  (3)  misprision of treason, (4)  espionage,  (5)  inciting to war or giving  motives for reprisals, (6) violation of neutrality,  (7)  correspondence with  hostile country, and  (8) flight to enemy's country.   (<em>See</em> Title One, Book Two, Revised Penal Code, entitled  "Crimes Against  National Security," under which are found  articles 114-121, penalizing the specific  crimes just mentioned.)   Of these  eight  crimes only the  first— treason—is a capital offense; none of the  seven others is punishable with death.</p>
<p>Under  the constitutional  provision and the  Rules  of Court above quoted, admission to "bail before conviction of all persons not  charged with capital offenses is mandatory and  not discretionary  with the court; they  "shall  be admitted to bail as of right."  No statute can in any manner impair  that constitutional right.  Therefore, the proviso in question to the effect that the political prisoners may, in the discretion of the People's Court, after due  notice to the Office of Special Prosecutors and hearing, be released on bail, even prior to the presentation of  the corresponding information, unless  the court finds that there is strong evidence of the commission of a capital offense, can only be construed to refer to such political prisoners as may be actually or prospectively  charged  with a  capital offense; because if that  statutory provision be construed to include political prisoners not charged or chargeable with  a  capital offense, it would be unconstitutional, since under the Constitution such political prisoners before conviction are entitled to bail as of right and not in the discretion  of the court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[c]</sup></p>
<p>Let us  cite a concrete example.   A  political prisoner is charged or chargeable  only with the simple crime of espionage, which is punishable with <em>prision correccional</em>.  He or she applies to the People's Court for release on bail.  The Solicitor General,  upon being  notified of  the application, does not oppose it but  recommends  a specific amount for the bail.  Can it be successfully contended that such a case is governed  by  the proviso in question  and that the application  for  bail has to be  set for hearing, after which the People's Court has the discretion to deny it?   No, because  such a  person under the Constitution "<em>shall</em> before conviction be bailable  by  sufficient sureties."   In such a case there is  no need for any hearing because there is no discretion to be exercised by the court on the matter.  The hearing mentioned in the proviso in question can only have for its purpose the determination of whether or not "there is strong evidence of the commission of a capital  offense." Therefore, when there is no  claim on the part of the Solicitor General  that  the applicant  for  bail is charged or chargeable with a capital offense, there is no necessity for any hearing.</p>
<p>Under  the  provision  of law then—it may be  asked— may the  People's Court admit such an  applicant to bail? Under section 3 of Rule 110  of the Rules of Court, which provides  that before conviction by the  Court of First Instance (the People's Court in such a case takes the place of the Court  of First  Instance),  "the  defendant shall be admitted to bail as of  right."  Section 22 of the  People's Court Law provides that  "the prosecution, trial  and disposal  of cases before the People's  Court shall be governed by existing laws and rules of court, unless otherwise expressly provided herein."   The "otherwise" does not apply to the hypothetical case  at hand because, as we have shown, the  proviso in  question cannot be applied to noncapital offenses without violating the Constitution.</p>
<p>What then  is the proper procedure to  be followed by the People's  Court  in disposing  of applications for bail? In accordance with the constitutional  and statutory provisions above quoted, all of which must  be harmonized and applied,  the procedure should be as follows:</p>
<p>As soon as  the application is led  the People's Court  shall notify the Solicitor  General  thereof.  If according to the proofs in the possession of the Solicitor General the applicant has been or may be charged with a  capital offense, he shall immediately either oppose the application or agree to it and recommend the amount of the bail bond, depending upon whether or not his proofs against the applicant are strong.   If he opposes  the  application,  the People's Court shall immediately set it for a summary hearing with the presence of both parties  for  the sole purpose of determining whether or not there  is strong  evidence of the commission of a capital offense.   If "there is, the court must deny the  application; if there is  not,  it must grant  it. Therein lies the  court's discretion to grant or deny  the bail—in the appreciation of the evidence.  If the Solicitor General does not  oppose  the application, either because the applicant  is  not  chargeable  with a capital offense or because he is  not yet in a position to determine whether or not the applicant is chargeable  with  a capital offense  or because even if the applicant has been or may be charged with a capital  offense the evidence he has at hand is  not strong, there is no necessity for a hearing because there is no issue to be  litigated and determined.  In that case the only discretion to be  exercised  by the court lies  in  the fixing of the amount of the bail bond, taking into consideration the recommendation of  the  Solicitor General and the constitutional mandate that  "excessive bail  shall  not  be required."</p>
<p>In the instant case the Solicitor General, upon being notified of the petitioner's application for bail, did not oppose said application  but  recommended that the bail bond  be fixed at P50,000.  The Solicitor General  is a responsible high officer of the Government  having the  same rank as the Under Secretary of Justice.  Under the People's Court Law he is the head of  the  Office  of  Special Prosecutors, charged with the heavy and delicate responsibility of prosecuting the  political prisoners mentioned in sections 2 and 19 of the People's Court  Law.  We see no reason or justification whatsoever to distrust and disregard his recommendation.  We have every reason to believe that he  knows his duty in the  premises under the Constitution and the existing laws, and that he has acted in accordance therewith.  It is therefore to be  presumed that when he did not oppose the petitioner's application for bail but on  the  contrary agreed  thereto by recommending the amount of the bail bond, it was either because the petitioner was not chargeable with  a capital offense or because the Solicitor General was not yet in a position to determine whether or not she Avas chargeable with a capital offense or  because even if she were so chargeable the evidence he  had  at hand was not strong.  Moreover, in failing to  oppose the  application  and in  recommending  that it be  granted,  the Solicitor General was undoubtedly, and properly, guided by the consideration that after all, even if the applicant should be provisionally released on bail, he would have a perfect right to move for  its cancellation and for her rearrest if he should  find later that there is strong evidence against her of the commission of a capital  offense and he should decide to charge her therewith.  We find therefore that the Solicitor General has acted strictly in accordance with law, equity, and justice.  It is unfair to him to compel him to disclose whatever evidence he may have  in his possession at this stage of the case by ordering a hearing on the application for bail in spite of his nonopposition thereto and his recommendation that  it be granted; and it is unjust to the petitioner, who has been confined in prison for about ten months without any formal  charge  having been  filed against her, to further withhold  from her  the provisional liberty on  bail to which she is of right entitled under  the Constitution and the existing laws.</p>
<p>Instead of firmly, fearlessly, and  instantly  applying  the constitutional and  statutory provisions,  which it admits are applicable, to the facts of the case as presented to us, the Court seems to waver, speculating on possibilities, and would  have  the  People's  Court  toy and dally with  the detainer's liberty.  The Court says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  *  *   While it  is true that the Solicitor  General on  October 5, 1945, recommended Fifty Thousand  Pesos (P50,000) as a reasonable bail 'on the strength of the evidence at hand,'  it may happen that thereafter his office may have secured additional  evidence which, in addition  to or in connection with that  he already possessed, in his opinion  is sufficiently strong  to  prove petitioner's guilt for  a capital offense, in which case, he  may yet  decide to oppose  the application for bail heretofore  filed by the petitioner at the hearing thereof hereinafter ordered.  * * *  Of course, it may also happen that, either because no such further evidence has  come into his possession or because, in his  judgment, the public interest would be better served by his withholding the  evidence that he  has until the trial on the merits, he would prefer not to oppose the application lor bail.  At the hearing; of  the application the Solicitor Genera] will be free to adopt one course or the other.  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the only  reason why  the Court does not grant the petition outright  is that it may  happen that after the Solicitor General  had recommended the bail to  the People's Court he  might have secured additional evidence which  in his opinion is sufficiently  strong to  prove petitioner's guilt of a capital offense, and  he may yet decide to  oppose the application for bail; that  is to say,  in such event he  should be given a chance to oppose  the application for bail if he cared to reveal his evidence before  the trial on the merits. But why waver in deciding the case as presented and speculate on unforeseen and unproven happenings when, after all, the release on bail before conviction is necessarily provisional and  not  final?  At  any time that the Solicitor General can convince the  court that he has strong evidence of the commission of a capital offense by  the petitioner, he may have  her rearrested  and her bond cancelled.</p>
<p>The Court says that at the hearing of the application which it  orders the People's  Court to hold, the Solicitor General will  be free to adopt one course or the other— meaning to oppose or not to oppose the  bail.  It directs what the  Solicitor General should do if  he should oppose, but does not indicate what the People's Court should do if the Solicitor  General should  not oppose.   In  the dispositive part the Court directs "that for the proper application of the pertinent constitutional, statutory and reglementary provisions alluded to in the body of this decision, a hearing of petitioner's application for bail be held  before the People's Court with due notice to the Solicitor General, as well as to the petitioner, as hereinabove outlined, said hearing, whether summary or otherwise, to be such as would enable the People's Court to exercise its sound discretion in the disposal of the aforesaid petition."  This seems to indicate that whether or not the Solicitor General opposes the application a hearing should be held—for what purpose if there  is no opposition, we do not know.  In the body of the decision, from which we have quoted above, it is stated that the Solicitor General may prefer not to oppose  the  application  for bail  either because no further evidence has come  into  his possession or because in his judgment  the public  interest  would  be better served by withholding the  evidence he  has until the trial  on the merits.  Why order a hearing  when the Solicitor General desires to withhold his evidence and prefers not to  oppose the bail?</p>
<p>We fear that such apparent inconsistency and ambiguity will be productive of unnecessary disputes and delays in the final disposition of the application for bail, which will probably necessitate another recourse to this Court. In the meantime the detainee, whose  constitutional right has been  disregarded, must continue to languish in jail.</p>
<p>On the threshold of our existence as an independent nation this Court  ought to define its attitude unequivocally and set a  definite line  of conduct to be followed  in deciding such question of vital importance as this, involving personal liberties.  Our decision in this and similar cases will form  a weather-vane by  which the  people can see whether we are traveling on the path of freedom and democracy or are wobbling in the direction  of the opposite way of life.  If  we condone,  tolerate,  or gloss over unlawful restraints or violations of  personal liberties and other rights guaranteed and protected by the Constitution, our  profession of adherence to freedom and democracy would be taunted as sheer mockery and undiluted  hypocrisy,  and we would not only disappoint the great  nation that initiated us in the democratic way of life but would also lose the  respect of all liberty-loving peoples.</p>
<p>We  think that the decision of  the  Court  in  this  case is another step in the  wrong direction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[d]</sup>.  Like a  woman's first lapse  of virtue,  the first wrong step of the Court will easily  be followed by another, and the rights of the citizens enumerated  in  the Bill  of  Rights  will gradually  be whittled away until they exist only in theory.</p>
<p>This dissent is intended as a warning against such  a calamity.  We deem  it pertinent to quote in this connection the noble words of Justice Jackson as United States Prosecutor of war crimes in Germany :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We  must never forget that the record on which we judge  these defendants today is  the  record on which history  will  judge  us tomorrow.</p>
  <p>"To pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well. We must summon  such detachment and  intellectual integrity to our task that this trial will commend itself to posterity as  fulfilling humanity's aspiration to  do justice." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our conclusion is that upon the record of the case before us the petitioner is  entitled to be released on  bail as  of right under subsection  (16),  section 1,  Article III of the Constitution and  section  3 of Rule 110 of the Rules  of Court, and that, therefore, there is no necessity to remand the case for further proceedings.</p>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING</em></p>
<p><strong>DE JOYA, J.,</strong></p>
<p>I fully concur in the opinion prepared by Mr. Justice Hiiado.   The observance  of the procedure  outlined  in the decision which is nothing new (Payao <em>vs.</em> Lesaca, 68 Phil., 210, 214; Marcos <em>vs.</em> Judge of the  Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte, G. R. No. 46490), will prevent any  possible criticism of the fairness and impartiality of the court, which are  absolutely essential to secure public confidence, which may be  undermined by a misapprehension of the true  spirit of the law, due perhaps to impetuosity or inexperience on the part  of a particular judge.   The  political prisoners now under custody are entitled to the same rights under the Constitution as those, actually accused of crimes.</p>

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[a]</sup>"Subsection (16).—"All persons shall before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties  *  *  *."
<p>Subsection (17).—"In all criminal  prosecutions the accused shall be presumed innocent until the  contrary  is proved  *   *  *." '</p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[b]</sup> "In construing statutes with  relation  to constitutional provisions, the courts  take into consideration the principle that every statute is to be read in the light of  the Constitution and  that the Constitution and a statute involving constitutional rights will be construed tog-ether as one  law,  ?  *  *."   (11 Am. Jur. Const. Law, sec. 96.)</p>
<p>"All statutes are  presumed to be enacted by the Legislature  with full knowledge of the existing condition of the law and with reference to it.  They are therefore to be  construed in connection and in harmony with the existing law, and as a part of a general and uniform system  of jurisprudence, and their meaning and  effect is to  be determined in  connection,  not only with  the  common  law  and  the constitution, but also  with reference to  their statutes  and the  decisions of the courts."   (59 C. J.,  1038.)</p>
<p>"No  single statute should be interpreted solely  by its own  words. Upon enactment it becomes a part of, and is to be read in connection with, the whole  body  of the law.  Its interpretation  is to be in the tight of the general policy  of previous  legislation and of the  long established principles  of law  and equity.  Every statute which  is properly the  subject of judicial  construction  should  receive such a construction as  will  not conflict with general principles and  will make it harmonize with the pre-existing body of  law.  *   *  * Statutes are to be construed with reference to the common law in existence at the time  of  enactment, and in  connection with other statutes which  relate  to the same subject matter."   (24  K.  C. L., 1052.)</p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[c]</sup> It is an elementary principle that where the validity of a statute is assailed and there are  two possible interpretations, by one of which the statute would be unconstitutional and by the other it would be valid, the court should adopt the construction which would uphold it.  It is the duty of courts  to adopt a construction of a statute that will bring it into harmony with the Constitution, if its language will permit."   (11 Am. Jur., Const. Law, sec. 97.)</p>
<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[d]</sup> The first wrong step, in our humble  conception, was the decision in the  case of  Eaquiza <em>vs.</em> Bradford  (September 13,  1945, p. 50, <em>ante</em>), wherein this  Court failed to enforce the due process clause of the  Constitution.<br>
