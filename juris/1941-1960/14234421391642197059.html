				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE  PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. PEDRO  R.  EXCONDE DEFENDANT AND  APPELLANT.</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The&nbsp; accused Pedro R. Exconde was convicted&nbsp; in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; of violating Central Bank Circular No. 37, approved September 25, 1952, limiting&nbsp; to P100&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of Philippine currency&nbsp; that an outgoing passenger&nbsp; could have on&nbsp; his person.&nbsp; The court below meted upon&nbsp; him&nbsp; a&nbsp; sentence&nbsp; four&nbsp; (4) months&nbsp; of imprisonment and fine of P100 and costs.<br><br>The facts are not&nbsp; disputed.&nbsp; On&nbsp; May 5, 1954, the appellant Pedro R. Exconde&nbsp; was&nbsp; on&nbsp; board the s.s. President Wilson, as one of its passengers bound for Japan.&nbsp; Supervising agent Jose A. Fojas,&nbsp; of the Department of&nbsp; Finance, found&nbsp; in Exconde's possession P5,090 in&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; currency,&nbsp; plus U. S.&nbsp; $50 in cash; travelers' checks for $100; and a&nbsp; Bank of America remitter's receipt for&nbsp; $350,&nbsp; Admittedly&nbsp; Exconde's&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; P5,000&nbsp; was&nbsp; not licensed, and was. in violation of&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank Circular No, 37&nbsp; (48 Off. Gaz. 3823) providing" as follows:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. Pursuant to section&nbsp; 34 of Republic Act No. 265 the Monetary Board&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby promulgating&nbsp; this circular.&nbsp; Violation of any&nbsp; of its&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; shall&nbsp; subject the&nbsp; offender to the penal provisions of said Act.<br><br>SEC. 2. The&nbsp; import and&nbsp; export&nbsp; of Philippine&nbsp; coins&nbsp; and notes without the necessary license&nbsp; issued&nbsp; by the Central Bank&nbsp; is prohibited except in&nbsp; the following cases:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) Travelers entering&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; may&nbsp; bring in&nbsp; Philippine coins and notes&nbsp; in an amount&nbsp; not exceeding&nbsp; P100, provided the coins do not exceed P50.&nbsp; In case&nbsp; of travelers arriving on ships, the coins they bring in shall not exceed P50 for first class passengers, P20 for second&nbsp; class&nbsp; passengers&nbsp; and P10 for third class passengers.<br><br>(<i>b</i>) Travelers leaving the Philippines&nbsp; may take with them&nbsp; Philippine coins and notes in an&nbsp; amount not exceeding P100, provided the coins do not exceed P5.<br><br>SEC. 3. The following shall also be held liable within the meaning of this circular:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) Any outgoing: passengers already booked and ready to&nbsp; leave the country found having in&nbsp; his person or among his luggage, at the airport or piers, an amount exceeding P100&nbsp; or Philippine&nbsp; coins exceeding P5 when no license&nbsp; has been previously obtained&nbsp; for the excess amount.<br><br>(<i>b</i>) The sender of any mail matter, envelope, or package&nbsp; already deposited in&nbsp; the&nbsp; mails, manifested or&nbsp; put on board an outgoing international carrier found to&nbsp; contain&nbsp; an&nbsp; amount&nbsp; exceeding Pl00 when no license has&nbsp; been previously obtained for the excess amount.<br><br>SEC. 4.&nbsp; All circulars, notifications or regulations previously promulgated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Monetary&nbsp; Board inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed.<br><br>SEC. 5. This&nbsp; circular shall take effect immediately."</blockquote>The&nbsp; aforesaid circular was promulgated in connection with sec.&nbsp; 34 of Republic Act&nbsp; 265 (Central Bank&nbsp; Act) providing that:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 34. <i>Proceedings&nbsp; upon violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; laws&nbsp; and regulations.</i>—<br><br>Whenever any person or entity willfully&nbsp; violates this Act or any order, instruction, rule or regulation legally issued by the Monetary&nbsp; Board, the person or persons responsible for such violation shall be punished by a fine of not&nbsp; more than twenty thousand pesos&nbsp; and by imprisonment of not more than five years.<br><br>"Whenever a banking institution&nbsp; persists in violating its&nbsp; charter or by-laws or any law, or orders, instructions, rules or regulations legally issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Monetary&nbsp; Board,&nbsp; or&nbsp; whenever a&nbsp; banking institution persist in&nbsp; carrying on its&nbsp; business in an unlawful or unsafe manner, the&nbsp; Board shall,&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Solicitor&nbsp; General,&nbsp; and without prejudice to the penalties provided in the preceding paragraph of this section, file a petition in the Court of First Instance praying the assistance of&nbsp; the court&nbsp; to compel the banking institution to discontinue the violations or practices objected to in the petition&nbsp; of the Board.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Monetary Board may,&nbsp; with the approval of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court, take such&nbsp; action as&nbsp; the court&nbsp; may deem necessary to compel the banking institution complained&nbsp; against to discontinue&nbsp; the violations&nbsp; or&nbsp; practices&nbsp; set forth in the&nbsp; Board's petition, and,&nbsp; if necessary, the Board&nbsp; may,&nbsp; under order of the Court, direct the&nbsp; Superintendent of Banks to liquidate the business of the institution."<br></blockquote>Two appeals were taken from&nbsp; the decision of the trial court&nbsp; and are&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; to us for decision.&nbsp;&nbsp; One&nbsp; is&nbsp; the appeal perfected by Exconde,&nbsp; who alleges that&nbsp; Circular No.&nbsp; 37 is invalid, and the other is the appeal taken&nbsp; by the Government&nbsp; from&nbsp; the lower court's refusal to order&nbsp; the confiscation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; P5,000.00 unauthorizedly held&nbsp; by&nbsp; Exconde and&nbsp; found in his&nbsp; possession by agent&nbsp; Fojas.<br><br>The first argument of appellant Exconde is that sec. 34 of the Central Bank Act can not validate the&nbsp; issuance of Circular No. 37 because sec. 34 refers solely to regulations under Art, IV, Chapter&nbsp; B of the Act, concerning activities of the "Department of&nbsp; Supervision and Examination" of banking institutions.<br><br>We see no merit in this&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; The&nbsp; first paragraph of sec. 34, heretofore quoted, is so broad in terms that it was evidently designed to establish penal sanctions for&nbsp; any and all violations of the&nbsp; Act&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; of&nbsp; the regulations&nbsp; legally&nbsp; issued by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Monetary&nbsp; Board;&nbsp;&nbsp; and there&nbsp; being&nbsp; no other sanctioning&nbsp; provision elsewhere in the&nbsp; Act itself,&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; stand,&nbsp; if upheld,&nbsp; would lead to the result that, with&nbsp; the exception of&nbsp; Art. IV, Chapter B, all other provisions of the Central Bank Act could be violated with impunity.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; effect the&nbsp; law&nbsp; could not have&nbsp; intended.<br><br>It is next argued that see. 14 of the Central Bank Law does&nbsp; not&nbsp; grant authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Monetary Board to prohibit&nbsp; the exportation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Philippine currency,&nbsp; and that if any such authority was in fact granted, the same is void as an invalid delegation of legislative power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 14 is as follows:<br><br>SEC. 14. <i> Exercise of authority</i>.—In order to exercise the authority&nbsp; granted to it under this Act, the Monetary Board shall:<br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp; Prepare and&nbsp; issue&nbsp; such rules and regulations as it considers necessary for the&nbsp; effective discharge&nbsp; of the&nbsp; responsibilities and exercise of&nbsp; the powers&nbsp; assigned to the Monetary Board and&nbsp; to the Central Bank under this Act;<br><br>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp; Direct the&nbsp; management, operations and&nbsp; administration of the Central Bank and&nbsp; prepare such rules and regulations&nbsp; as it may deem&nbsp; necessary or convenient for this purpose;<br><br>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; On the recommendation of the Governor, appoint, fix the remunerations, and remove all officers and employees of the Central Bank, with tho exception of the Governor; and<br><br>(<i>d</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp; Authorize&nbsp; such&nbsp; expenditures&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Central Bank as&nbsp; are in the interest of the effective administration&nbsp; and operation of the Bank."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is well established in&nbsp; this&nbsp; jurisdiction that,&nbsp; while the making of&nbsp; laws is a non-delegable activity that corresponds&nbsp; exclusively&nbsp; to Congress,&nbsp;&nbsp; nevertheless&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter may&nbsp; constitutionally delegate authority to promulgate rules and regulations to implement a given legislation and&nbsp; effectuate its&nbsp; policies, for&nbsp; the reason that the&nbsp; legislature&nbsp; often finds&nbsp; it impracticable&nbsp; (if not impossible) to anticipate and provide for the&nbsp; multifarious and complex situations that may&nbsp; be met in carrying the law into&nbsp; effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; All&nbsp; that is required&nbsp; is&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; regulation should&nbsp; be germane to&nbsp; the objects and purposes of the law; that the regulation be not in contradiction with it,&nbsp; but conform to the standards that&nbsp; the&nbsp; law prescribes&nbsp; (Calalang <i>vs. </i>Williams, 70.Phil. 727;&nbsp; Pangasinan Transportation&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Public Service&nbsp; Commission, 70 Phil.&nbsp; 22;&nbsp; Peo. <i> vs. </i> Rosenthal, 68 Phil.&nbsp; 328; Peo. <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Vera, 39 Phil.&nbsp; 660; Rubi <i> vs.</i> Prov. Board of Mindoro, 39 Phil.&nbsp; 660).<br><br>Thus, in Calalang <i> vs.</i> Williams, <i>supra, </i>we ruled (p. 732):<br><blockquote> "In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; People&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Itosenthal&nbsp; and Osmena, G, R.&nbsp; Nos. 46076 and 46077, promulgated&nbsp; June 12, 1939,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> and in Pangasinan Transportation <i>vs.</i> The Public Service Commission, G. R. No. 47065, promulgated&nbsp; June&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1940,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font> this Court had&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; to&nbsp; observe that the principle of&nbsp; separation of powers has been made to adapt itself to the&nbsp; complexities&nbsp; of modern&nbsp; governments,&nbsp; giving&nbsp; rise&nbsp; to the adoption, within certain limits, of&nbsp; the principle&nbsp; of subordinate legislation, not&nbsp; only&nbsp; in the United States and England&nbsp; but&nbsp; in practically all modern governments.&nbsp; Accordingly, with the Rowing. complexity of modern life, the&nbsp; multiplication,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the subjects&nbsp; of governmental regulations, and the increased difficulty of administering the laws, the rigidity&nbsp; of the theory of separation of&nbsp; governmental&nbsp; powers has, to a large&nbsp; extent,&nbsp; been relaxed by&nbsp; permitting the delegation of greater&nbsp; powers by tho legislative and&nbsp; vesting a larger amount of discretion in administrative and executive officials, not only in the execution of the laws, hut also in the&nbsp; promulgation of&nbsp; certain&nbsp; rules&nbsp; and&nbsp; regulations&nbsp; calculated&nbsp; to&nbsp; promote&nbsp; public interest."</blockquote>Considering that the "responsibilities&nbsp; and—powers" assigned to the Bank and its Monetary&nbsp; Board, mentioned in sec 14 (<i>a</i>), are those&nbsp; specified in sec. 2 of the Act:<br><blockquote>"SEC- 2. <i>Responsibilities&nbsp; and&nbsp; objectives.</i>—It shall be the responsibility of the Central Bank&nbsp; of the Philippines&nbsp; to&nbsp; administer the monetary and&nbsp; banking system of the Republic.<br><br>It&nbsp; shall be the&nbsp; duty&nbsp; of the Central&nbsp; Bank to use the&nbsp; powers granted to it under&nbsp; this Act to achieve the following objectives:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) To maintain monetary stability&nbsp; in the Philippines;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) To preserve&nbsp; the&nbsp; international value of the&nbsp; peso and the convertibility of the peso into&nbsp; other freely&nbsp; convertible currencies; and<br><br>(<i>c</i>) To promote a&nbsp; rising&nbsp; level&nbsp; of production, employment&nbsp; and real income in the Philippines."<br></blockquote>as well as those prescribed in sec. 64 of same law, to wit:<br><blockquote> "SEC. 64.&nbsp; <i>Guiding&nbsp; principle</i>,—The Monetary Board shall endeavor to control any&nbsp; expansion&nbsp; or&nbsp; contraction in tho supply, or any rise or fall in prices, which, in&nbsp; the opinion of the&nbsp; Board, is prejudicial to the attainment or maintenance of a high level of production,&nbsp; employment, and real income.&nbsp; In&nbsp; adopting policies and measures in accordance with&nbsp; this, principle&nbsp; the&nbsp; Monetary&nbsp; Board shall have due regard for their effects on the availability and cost of money to particular sectors of the economy as well as to&nbsp; the economy as a whole,&nbsp; and their effects on the relationship of domestic prices and costs to&nbsp; world prices and costs," </blockquote>we experience no&nbsp; difficulty in concluding that Circular No. 37 here in question was&nbsp; a&nbsp; valid exercise of the regulatory power delegated by the&nbsp; Central Bank&nbsp; Act, and that said Circular is in harmony&nbsp; with the objectives sought to be achieved by that&nbsp; law, particularly the control of any prejudicial&nbsp; "expansion and&nbsp; contraction of the money supply" (sec. 64) and&nbsp; "the preservation of the international value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peso"&nbsp; (sec. 2, par.&nbsp; b).&nbsp; It requires&nbsp; no effort to understand that unless the exportation of currency is curtailed, the value of the peso in terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; other&nbsp; currencies can not be maintained, for the increase of the peso supply in foreign countries would tend to depress its value therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; How&nbsp; far&nbsp; the limitation should&nbsp; go may&nbsp; give rise to honest differences of opinion, but the power to restrict the export&nbsp; of Philippine currency&nbsp; is undoubtedly there, and courts are only concerned&nbsp; with the question of authority, not the wisdom of the measure&nbsp; involved.<br><br>Appellants does not dispute that the objectives set&nbsp; forth in sees.&nbsp; 2&nbsp; and 64 of the Central Bank Act constitute adequate standards&nbsp; to guide&nbsp; the Bank&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Monetary Board; nor may&nbsp; doubt be entertained&nbsp; on that score, specially when compared to&nbsp; those&nbsp; criteria upon which this Court has&nbsp; previously affixed the&nbsp; stamp&nbsp; of its approval, like "public welfare"&nbsp; (Cardona <i> vs. </i>Binangonan,&nbsp; 37 Phil. 547); "necessary in the&nbsp; interest of law and order"&nbsp; (Rubi <i>vs. </i>Provincial Board,&nbsp; 39 Phil.&nbsp; 660);&nbsp; "public&nbsp; interest" (People <i>vs. </i>Rosenthal, 68&nbsp; Phil. 328);&nbsp; "justice and equity and the substantial&nbsp; merits&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case"&nbsp; (Int. Hardwood <i>vs.</i> Pañgil Fed. of Labor, 70 Phil. 602).<br><br>Having reached these conclusions, we must likewise assent to the proposition that the violation of&nbsp; Circular No. 37 comes within the penal sanctions of the Central Bank Act; because a violation or infringement of a rule or regulation validly issued can constitute a misdemeanor or&nbsp; a crime&nbsp; punishable as&nbsp; provided in the&nbsp; authorizing statute, and by virtue of the latter.<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *, the&nbsp; regulations adopted lander legislative authority by a particular department must be in harmony with&nbsp; the provisions of the&nbsp; law, and for the sole purpose of carrying&nbsp; Into&nbsp; effect its general provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; By such regulations, of course, the law itself can not be extended.&nbsp; So long,&nbsp; however, as&nbsp; the&nbsp; regulations?&nbsp; relate solely&nbsp; to carrying&nbsp; into effect the provisions of the law, they are valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; A violation of a regulation prescribed by an executive&nbsp; officer of the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; in&nbsp; conformity with&nbsp; and&nbsp; based upon&nbsp; a statute authorizing such regulation, constitutes an. offense and renders the offender liable&nbsp; to punishment in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of .law." ("United&nbsp; States<i> vs. </i>Bailey, 9 Pet., 238, 252, 254, 256;&nbsp; Caha <i>vs.</i> United&nbsp; States,&nbsp; 152&nbsp; IT. S., 211,&nbsp; 218, United&nbsp; States<i> vs. </i> Eaton, 144 U.&nbsp; S.,&nbsp; 677), (U. S, <i>vs.</i> Tupasi, Molina, 29 Phil. 124)<br><br>"The legislature&nbsp; cannot delegate to a board or to an executive officer&nbsp; the&nbsp; power to declare&nbsp; what acts shall constitute a criminal offense.&nbsp; It is competent for it, however, to authorize a commission to prescribe duties on which the law may&nbsp; operate&nbsp; in&nbsp; imposing&nbsp; a penalty and in&nbsp; effectuating the&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose designed in enacting the law.&nbsp; There are numerous eases&nbsp; in which the courts&nbsp; have sustained statutes authorizing administrative officers to promulgate rules on a&nbsp; specified&nbsp; subject&nbsp; and&nbsp; providing' that&nbsp; a&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; such rules or orders should constitute a misdemeanor,&nbsp; punishable as provided in the&nbsp; statute."&nbsp; (11 Am. Jur. pp. 965-966)<br><br>"Where&nbsp; statutes&nbsp; provide that&nbsp; violation of a rule or&nbsp; regulation of an administrative agency shall be a misdemeanor, if&nbsp; the rule or 'regulation&nbsp; is reasonable,&nbsp; the enforcement&nbsp; of the penalty for its violation is sustained by the courts, for the legislature and not the administrative agency made the action penal."&nbsp; (Vol. 1, Sutherland Statutory&nbsp; Construction, p. 92)<br></blockquote>Turning now to the State's appeal, it is apparent that the refusal of the court below to order the confiscation of the unlicensed&nbsp; money&nbsp; found in&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of the accused Exconde is contrary to the provisions of Art. 10 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal Code, that read as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 10. <i>Offenses not&nbsp; subject to the provisions of the&nbsp; Code</i>.— Offenses which are or in the future may be punishable under special laws are not&nbsp; subject to the&nbsp; provisions of this Code.&nbsp; This&nbsp; Code shall&nbsp; be supplementary to such. laws, unless&nbsp; the latter should specially provide the contrary."<br></blockquote>Pursuant&nbsp; to this rule, Art. 45 of the Penal Code (providing for the confiscation or forfeiture of the instruments or tools&nbsp; employed&nbsp; in the&nbsp; commission&nbsp; of a crime)&nbsp; has repeatedly been&nbsp; applied to&nbsp; crimes penalized by&nbsp;&nbsp; special laws, in default of a contrary mandate&nbsp; therein.&nbsp; Such a course&nbsp; was adopted in U. S. <i>vs.</i> Bruhez, 28 Phil. 305, involving a violation of the Opium Law; U. S. <i>vs. </i>Filart, 30 Phil. 80 (infraction of the&nbsp; lottery act, No. 1757); Villaruz <i>vs.</i> Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance, 71&nbsp; Phil. 72 (usury); Commissioner of Customs <i>vs.</i> Sadia, 95 Phil., 439, 50 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. 3560&nbsp; (violation of the Revised Administrative Code).<br><br>In the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Bruhez,<i> supra, </i> this&nbsp; Court affirmed the&nbsp; confiscation of seven P500-peso bills&nbsp; delivered to&nbsp; a customs official in consideration of his allowing: an illegal importation of opium, and considered the money as an instrument for the commission' of the crime.&nbsp; Similarly, in&nbsp; Commissioner of Customs&nbsp; <i>vs</i>.&nbsp; Encarnacion,&nbsp; we held that dutiable articles imported&nbsp; without&nbsp; having&nbsp; been declared as required by law&nbsp; should&nbsp; be declared forfeited to the Government under Art.&nbsp; 45 of the Eevised Penal Code.<br><br>If in People <i>vs.</i> Paet, 58 Off. Gaz. 668, and People <i>vs. </i>Sanchez, supra,&nbsp; 745, this Court&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to&nbsp; entertain&nbsp; the<br><br>Government's&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; refusal of&nbsp; the1&nbsp; Court of First Instance to decree such,a forfeiture, it did so, not because Article 45 of the penal Code did not apply, but exclusively on the ground that in a criminal case wherein the accused&nbsp; had&nbsp; not&nbsp; appealed,&nbsp; no appeal&nbsp; can be&nbsp; interposed by the Government with&nbsp; a view to increasing the penalty imposed by the court below; and confiscation being an additional penalty,&nbsp; the accused would be placed twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense, should the Government's&nbsp; appeal be entertained.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the present case of accused Exconde, his own appeal has removed all bars to the review and correction of the penalty imposed by the court below, even if an increase&nbsp; thereof should be the result.&nbsp; (Rule 12C, sec. 11)<br><br>Summing up, we hold: (1) that Circular No.&nbsp; 37, issued by the&nbsp; Monetary&nbsp; Board of the Central Bank, is a valid exercise of the regulatory power constitutionally delegated to the same&nbsp; under the terms&nbsp; of the Central Bank&nbsp; Act (Rep. Act No. 265);&nbsp; (2) that violations of said&nbsp; circular are punishable as criminal offenses under the provisions of the first paragraph of section 34&nbsp; of said&nbsp; Act; and&nbsp; (3) that, pursuant to&nbsp; Article 10 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, Art. 45 of the said code applies to criminal proceedings for violations&nbsp; of the Central Bank Act&nbsp; or&nbsp; of the&nbsp; regulations validly&nbsp; issued in accordance with the&nbsp; same.<br><br>Wherefore&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; therefore modified by ordering that the unlicensed money found in the possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant Exconde be declared&nbsp; forfeited&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; all&nbsp; other respects,&nbsp; the appealed judgment is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against the accused appellant&nbsp; Pedro R. Exconde,&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
