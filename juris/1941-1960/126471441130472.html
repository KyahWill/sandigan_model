				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>These  two cases were jointly tried before, and  decided by, the Court of First Instance of  Manila,  the questions involved therein being identical.</p>
<p>Defendant Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa  Manila Railroad Company,  is a duly registered  labor union and relief association, composed as its name indicates, of employees of the Manila Railroad Company, hereinafter referred to as the  company.  Bienvenido Pacia,  plaintiff  in case G. R, No. L-8787, and Vicente Vinas and Guillermo  Orbeta, plaintiffs in case G. R. No. L-8788, were  members  of said association: Pacia, from May 1946  to June 1951, when he was dismissed, from the service of the Manila Railroad Company for prolonged absence; Vinas,  from April 1946 to September 10, 1952, when he was dismissed by the company, for "falsification. and conversion of the amount of P6.40"; and Orbeta, from May 1946 to December 24,  1952, when he was dismissed, with prejudice to future reinstatement, for theft of one can of lubricant.</p>
<p>At the time of said dismissals of plaintiffs herein, Article VI, section 1, paragraph (<em>f</em>)  of the  Constitution  and by-laws of the defendant,  which had been approved in  1950, provided that any member separated from the service of the company  shall be  given by the defendant a gratuity of P1,000,: if he had served the company  continuously for forty years, and that,  otherwise, he shall have a gratuity of P100 for each year  of service, not exceeding the aggregate amount of  P1,000.   So,  after their  aforementioned dismissals,  plaintiffs filed, with the  defendant,  their  respective claims for gratuity: Pacia, in April 1952; Vinas, on June  30, 1953; and Orbeta, on January 30,  1953,  although the last two plaintiffs had made their verbal claims before  the  dates  stated  after their  respective  names. Defendant rejected  these claims for gratuity, upon the ground that  plaintiffs had been dismissed for cause.  Hence plaintiffs instituted these two cases, in the Court of First Instance  of  Manila, for  the  recovery of the  gratuities allegedly  due them under the aforementioned provision of defendant's constitution and by-laws, as approved in 1950.</p>
<p>The only defense  set up in defendant's answer is that,. having been  dismissed for cause, plaintiffs are not entitled to gratuity under the provisions of said constitution and by-laws,  as  amended on  March 27, 1953, which amendment is  said "to  have a  retroactive effect"  (Record  on Appeal, pp.  7  and 24).  It appears that, as amended  on the  date  last mentioned,  defendant's members  dismissed by the company for breach of the laws  in force  in the Philippines or of the rules or regulations of the company, involving moral turpitude, such as, larceny,  fraud, deceit and complicity in the commission of similar offenses, were excluded  from the benefits of the gratuity above referred to.  The only issues submitted for determination and passed upon by  the Court of First Instance of Manila  was, accordingly, whether said amendment had retroactive effect. In  disposing of these two cases,  said court, therefore, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The only question now before  the court is:  Shall the amendment  to the  by-laws  of the  association promulgated on  March 27, 1953, have  a retroactive effect?</p>
  <p>"The court holds  and so sustains that said amendment  has  a retroactive  effect  because when' one becomes a  member of  an association, he  submits himself  to the rules, regulations and by-laws of said association; and as long as the by-laws of said association are promulgated and approved legally, then there  is no question that  it  has a retroactive effect.  Since  the plaintiffs in these cases do not question the legality or the propriety  of the amendment to the  by-laws of the  association upon  which they now claim compensation, they are not, under the rules, regulations and by-laws of the association, entitled to the compensation which they now demand and claim"</p>
  <p>"In view of the foregoing, the case is hereby dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs  in both  cases  have appealed  from this decision, upon the ground that, having been dismissed by the company prior  to  the aforementioned  amendment, the same  should not, and cannot,  be applied to  them.  This contention is well taken for:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every  amendment is  deemed to have a prospective effect,  in  the  absence of  express or clear  provision  to the contrary, which does not exist in the cases under consideration.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The right of plaintiffs,  Pacia,  Viñas  and  Orbeta, to  gratuity, under  defendant's constitution and  by-laws, as approved in 1950, accrued upon  their separation from the service, on June  1, 1951, September  10,  1952, and December  24,  1952,  respectively.  Hence, even  if the amendment  adopted on March 27, 1953,  had  provided for its  retroactive operation,  it  would  have  been  null and void,  and,  accordingly, ineffective,  insofar as it  affected the right thus previously vested in plaintiffs herein, for the defendant  could not,  and cannot,  by its unilateral act, impair  its contractual  obligations.   The questionable character of defendant's contention becomes more apparent when we  consider  that the amendment in question was adopted eleven months after  the filing  of the claim  of plaintiff Pacia, and about two months after the submission of the formal claim of plaintiff Orbeta.   Had said amendments been meant  to operate  retrospectively,  it would appear as if the approval  thereof  by the  defendant had been prompted by a desire  to evade or defeat  said  pending and other similar claims.</li>
</ol>
<p>In  this  connection, it should be noted, also, that, contrary to defendant's pretense, the aforementioned gratuity is not an act of liberality or donation on its part, because its  members—like  those of any other labor  union and relief association—are required to pay dues, in consideration of the rights and privileges attached to their membership,  including,  in the present cases,  the  gratuity  in question.  Moreover,  if said gratuity  were regarded as a donation, it would be one "with  an onerous cause" which is  "governed  by the rules  on  contracts"  (Article  733, Civil Code of the Philippines).   At any rate, even a pure and simple donation, or a promise to donate, for a valuable consideration, once accepted, is  binding upon the donor or  promisor,  who  may not  revoke  or  withdraw it,  at pleasure, either  totally or partially.</p>
<p>It is  urged by the defendant that it is "implicit"  in the provisions  of  the  constitution and by-laws  thereof that its members shall serve the company honestly, faithfully and satisfactorily.  In support  of  this  proposition, defendant quotes, in its brief,  alleged portions of  said constitution and by-laws,  which are  said to  have been taken from its  preamble and the provisions  relative  to the objectives of the  union and the duties of its members. However,  said  alleged  portions  of the  constitution and by-laws were not introduced, or even  offered  in evidence in the lower court, to which these cases  were submitted for decision upon  stipulations  of facts,  in  which only paragraph  (<em>f</em>)  of section 1 of Article VI of said instrument,  as adopted  in 1950,  and  the  amendment thereof, approved  on March 27,  1953,  were transcribed.  Besides, defendant's  answer  in both cases and  said stipulations  of facts had the effect  of limiting  the issue to the question whether said amendment operated  retrospectively.  This, in turn, implied that, as understood and construed by the very  defendant, plaintiffs were  entitled  to the gratuity in question,  before said amendment.  Indeed,  the  same would have  been unnecessary if the condition therein provided were  already imposed in  the constitution and by-laws,  prior  thereto.  Independently of the foregoing,  defendant may not now be permitted to change fundamentally, much less reverse the nature of its  defense.</p>
<p>Considering that  plaintiffs  Pacia,  Vinas  and  Orbeta, . had been  in  the .service of the company  for 5  years,  6 years and 5 months and 6 years and 7 months, respectively, it follows that,  under  the  provisions of  paragraph  (<em>f</em>) of section 1, Article VI, of  said constitution and by-laws, as it was in force at the time of their  dismissal by the company,  said plaintiffs are  entitled  to  collect  from the defendant the sums  of P500, P640 and P656, respectively.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision  appealed from is hereby reversed, and another one  shall be entered  sentencing the defendant to pay to plaintiffs Bienvenido  Pacia,  Vicente Viñas  and Guillermo Orbeta,  the  aforementioned  sums of P500, P640 and P656, respectively,  with interest thereon, at the legal rate, from  December 10, 1953, as to the first sum, and  from February 20,  1954,  as  to  the last two sums,  these being the dates of the  filing  of  their respective complaints.  The defendant shall, also, pay the costs.   It  is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C.  J.,  Bengzon,  Montemayor,  Jugo,  Bautisia Angelo, Labrador, Reyes,  J.  B.  L.</em>,  and  <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
