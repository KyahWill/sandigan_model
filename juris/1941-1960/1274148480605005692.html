				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On August 28, 1946, Feliciano Sarmiento filed against petitioners-appellees, 
a complaint which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"Comes now the plaintiff, thru his undersigned counsels, and to this 
Honorable Court, respectfully alleges:</p>
<p>"1. That the plaintiff is of age and residing at San Dionisio, Parañaque, 
Rizal; while the defendants are also of age, with Angelina Canaynay, Prudencia 
V. Asprec and Cleto Asprec having their residence and postal address at San 
Dionisio, Parañaque, Rizal, and Pedro O. Jose residing at his postal address in 
409 Real Street, Parañaque, Rizal;</p>
<p>"2. That plaintiff is the lawful owner of that certain parcel of unregistered 
and unsurveyed residential land located at San Dionisio, Parañaque, Rizal, and 
more particularly described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>" 'A parcel of unregistered and unsurveyed residential land located at San 
Dionisio, Parañaque, Rizal, bounded on the N by Callejon Moras, on the E by 
Calle Real, on the S by Simon San Agustin and on the W by Cirilo Jaramillo, 
containing an area of 161.06 square meters more or less, covered by Tax 
Declaration No. 11466 of the municipality of Parañaque, Province of Rizal, 
declared for taxation purposes by Feliciano Sarmiento since July 26, 
1922.'</p></blockquote>
<p>"3. That on or about January 15, 1920, the defendants, Angelina Canaynay and 
her daughter, Prudencia V. Asprec, then single and now married to Cleto Asprec, 
entered into a verbal contract with the herein plaintiff whereby the latter 
leased to the former the land above-described under an agreed rental of P3 a 
month, payable at the end of each month;</p>
<p>"4. That by virtue of the contract of lease referred to in the preceding 
paragraph, the defendants, Angelina Canaynay and Prudencia V. Asprec, then 
single, bought and acquired, on or about January 15, 1920, a residential house 
erected on the said lot from a former lessee, Atty. Manuel Jose of Parañaque, 
Rizal;</p>
<p>"5. That defendant Pedro O. Jose is presently the occupant of the house 
mentioned in paragraph 4 hereof;</p>
<p>"6. That defendants Angelina Canaynay and Prudencia V. Asprec have so far 
paid to plaintiff the amount of P130 corresponding to the rentals for the months 
of January 15, 1920 to August 25, 1923, inclusive;</p>
<p>"7. That plaintiff has several times verbally demanded of the defendants to 
pay the unpaid rentals and to vacate the premises in question, the last demand 
having: been made on them personally and in writing on August 3, 1946, but they 
failed and refused and still continue to fail and to refuse to pay the rentals 
now amounting to P828 and to vacate the premises described above to the 
prejudice of the plaintiff;</p>
<p>"8. That plaintiff is now in need of the premises subject of this complaint 
for the construction of his own house.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed that, after due hearing, judgment be 
rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants:</p>
<p>"(<i>a</i>) For the restitution of the above-mentioned premises;</p>
<p>"(<i>b</i>) For the payment of the sum of P828 representing the rentals in 
arrears, with legal interest thereon from the filing of this complaint;</p>
<p>"(<i>c</i>) For the immediate removal of the house from the premises at 
defendant's expense;</p>
<p>"(<i>d</i>) For costs of this suit and attorney's fees and such other 
remedies as shall be deemed just and reasonable in the premises.</p>
<p>"Manila, Philippines, August 28, 1946."</p></blockquote>
<p>Defendants answered admitting the allegations in paragraphs 1 and 5, denying 
the allegations in paragraph 2, and averring lack of knowledge as to the truth 
of the allegations of paragraphs 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 of the complaint, and as an 
affirmative defense alleged that defendant Angelina Canaynay acquired ownership 
of the property in question by prescription for having possessed it over a 
period of twenty years.</p>
<p>In September, 1946, petitioners-appellees filed with the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal, a petition for a writ of certiorari, impugning the 
jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace Court of Parañaque, alleging that its 
jurisdiction in forcible entry and unlawful detainer cases extends only within a 
period of one year from and after the date of the accrual of the cause of 
action, and because defendants have interposed an affirmative defense of 
prescription, which necessarily involves the question of ownership of the land, 
and that the petitioners moved for the dismissal of the case, but Judge 
Guillermo Romero, of the justice of the peace court, denied the motion, thus 
acting in excess of his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>On September 24, 1946, Judge Eulalio Garcia of the Court of First Instance of 
Rizal, required respondents to answer the petition and ordered Judge Romero to 
refrain from trying the ejectment case until further orders.</p>
<p>On November 12, 1946, Judge Garcia rendered decision, ordering Judge Romero 
of the Justice of the Peace Court of Parañaque, to desist from continuing taking 
cognizance of the ejectment case in question, declaring final the writ of 
preliminary injunction ordering Judge Romero to refrain from proceeding with the 
case, and dismissing the complaint in the same, with costs against Feliciano 
Sarmiento.</p>
<p>The latter appealed against the decision.</p>
<p>Appellant Sarmiento made five assignments of error in his brief. Appellees 
choose not to file any brief. They did not even appear to argue the case at the 
hearing which took place on March 21, 1947.</p>
<p>Two main questions are raised in this case: First, whether the complaint was 
filed within the one-year period prescribed by section 1 of Rule 72, and second, 
whether the defense of ownership set up by defendants had the effect of 
divesting the justice of the peace court of its jurisdiction to take cognizance 
of the case.</p>
<p>Section 1 of Rule 72 provides that the one-year period provided therein must 
be reckoned from the date of the "unlawful deprivation or withholding of 
possession."</p>
<p>In paragraph 7 of the complaint, it is alleged that plaintiff has several 
times verbally demanded the defendants to pay the unpaid rents and to vacate the 
premises, the last demand having been made on them personally and in writing on 
August 3, 1946. Under the said paragraph, it is evident that the "unlawful 
deprivation or withholding of possession," mentioned by section 1 of Rule 72, 
started on August 3, 1946, when formal demand for vacating the premises was 
made. This position is strengthened by the allegation in paragraph 8 of the 
complaint to the effect that "plaintiff is now in need of the premises subject 
of this complaint for the construction of his own house."</p>
<p>The fact that it is alleged in the complaint that defendants failed to pay 
the rents since after August 25, 1923, does not make unlawful defendant's 
withholding of possession of the property. Mere failure to pay rents does not 
<i>ipso facto</i> make unlawful tenant's possession of the premises. It is the 
owner's demand for tenant to vacate the premises, when the tenant, has failed to 
pay the rents on time, and tenant's refusal or failure to vacate, which make 
unlawful withholding of possession. There is no legal obstacle for the owner to 
allow a defaulting tenant to remain in the rented property one month, one year, 
several years, or even decades. That consent, no matter how long it may last, 
makes lawful tenant's possession. Only when that consent is withdrawn and the 
owner demands tenant to leave the property is the owner's right of possession 
asserted and the tenant's refusal or failure to move out makes his possession 
unlawful, because it is violative of the owner's preferential right of 
possession.</p>
<p>On the next question, it is a well-established doctrine that what determines 
the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court in cases like the one at bar 
is the nature of the action pleaded as appears in the allegations of the 
complaint. The averments of the complaint and the character of the relief sought 
are the ones that must be consulted. Defendant's claim of title acquired by 
prescription cannot defeat the jurisdiction once established by what is pleaded 
in the complaint. Only when, after hearing the evidence, the justice of the 
peace court shall have found that what is litigated in effect between the 
parties is the ownership, is when said court shall lose its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, the appealed decision of the Court of First Instance 
of Rizal is reversed. The Justice of the Peace Court of Parañaque may proceed 
with the hearing and trial of the ejectment case No. 9, entitled "Feliciano 
Sarmiento <i>vs</i>. Angelina Canaynay et al.," until final 
judgment.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Hilado, Bengzon, Briones, Padilla,</i> and 
<i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p>PARAS, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p>The only actual occupant of the house standing on the lot claimed by the 
respondent-appellant is one Pedro O. Jose. There is no allegation whatsoever in 
the detainer complaint filed by said respondent regarding any agreement of lease 
between him and said occupant or any privity between the latter and the herein 
petitioners-appellees, the defendants in the detainer case. It is alleged in the 
complaint that the occupancy by the appellees of the lot in question without 
payment of the stipulated rent commenced in August, 1923, and that several 
demands for payment of rentals and to vacate the premises had been made on the 
appellees, the last one in writing on August 3, 1946.</p>
<p>The justice of the peace court has jurisdiction in a detainer case, if and 
when the complaint is filed within one year from the date of "unlawful 
deprivation or withholding of possession." A demand to vacate need not be in 
writing, and inasmuch as the appellees have allegedly defaulted in paying the 
agreed rentals since 1923, and several demands have admittedly been made, 
without any specification that said demands were all for the default occurring 
within the one-year period prior to the date of the filing of the detainer 
complaint, the logical conclusion is that one or some of such demands had been 
made more than one year or long before the written demand of Agust 3, 1946. From 
the very allegations of the complaint, therefore, the case is not within the 
jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court, and the appealed decision of the 
Court of First Instance of Rizal dismissing said complaint should be 
affirmed.</p>
