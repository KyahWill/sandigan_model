				<H3>JOSEPH FELDMAN, PETITIONER, VS. HON. BEMETRIO ENCARNACION, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, VICTORIO LACHENAL, ALFONSO LACHENAL AND JOSE VILLAFLOR, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The petition seeks to annul the order of the respondent court
entered on 30 June 1953, the dispositive part of which reads as follows:
<blockquote>
  <p>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the second motion of the
defendants in the opinion of this Court is in order, and the plaintiff
is hereby ordered to deposit with the Clerk of Court of this Court the
accumulated unpaid rentals including interest thereon in the total
amount of P119,700 and the corresponding rental on the said property
every month from May 1, 1953 until the appeal is finally decided; * * *
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for lack of jurisdiction of the respondent court to enter it.</p>
<p>The petitioner and the respondents are agreed that in civil case No.
7799 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal entitled Joseph Feldman,
plaintiff; Mercedes H. Vda. de Hidalgo, intervenor, as party-plaintiff;
Hon. Herbert Brownell, Jr., Attorney General of the United States in
lieu of the Philippine Alien Property Administrator of the United
States, intervenor versus Ramon L. Corpus, etc., defendants ; Victorio
Lachenal, Ildefonso Lachenal, and Jose Villaflor, joinders, as
parties-defendant, judgment was rendered on the counterclaim of the
defendants, the pertinent dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* * * .On the counterclaim of the defendants, the
plaintiffs and his business partners, Henry Pile and George Feldman,
are hereby ordered to vacate and to surrender to the defendants the
property formerly known as Varadero de Navotas * * * and to pay the
defendants, by way of rentals on the shipyard the amount of P1,000 a
month from and beginning June 1, 1946, up to the date the physical
possession of the entire property or shipyard with all its accessories
and improvements thereon shall have been actually returned to and duly
received by the defendants, the registered owners thereof, with legal
interest thereon from the date of the filing of the counterclaim; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>that from such judgment a notice of appeal, an appeal bond and a
record of appeal were filed on 30 October 1950; that on 10 March 1952
the record on appeal was amended; that on 24 March 1952 the trial court
issued an order which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There being no opposition to the amended record on
appeal, dated March 10, 1952, filed by counsel for the plaintiff, which
is also adopted by the above named intervenor, and finding the same to
be correct and in order, the said amended record on appeal is hereby
approved.</p>
  <p>The Clerk of Court is hereby directed to certify
and elevate the same to the Court of Appeals, together with all the
exhibits adduced during the trial, oral and documentary, within the
period prescribed by the Rules of Court; that the record on appeal was
forwarded to and docketed in the Court of Appeals as CA-G. R. No.
9375-R; that on 3 August 1953 the case was forwarded to this Court by
the Court of Appeals; that on 14 May 1953, the respondents Victorio
Lachenal, Alfonso Lachenal and Jose Villaflor, defendants therein,
filed in the respondent court a supplemental motion, the prayer of
which reads as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol><li> That the plaintiff (now petitioner) be ordered to deposit
with the Clerk of this Court (Court of First Instance of Rizal) the
accumulated rental plus interest in the total amount of P119,700 and
the monthly rentals of P1,000 every month beginning June 1, 1953,
until the decision appealed from shall have been finally considered and
disposed of by the appellate court;<br><br>
  </li><li> That the
plaintiff and his business partners be ordered and enjoined not to
sell, encumber, remove, dismantle, or otherwise dispose of any of the
installation, equipments, machineries and motor vehicles listed in the
Annex "B" hereto attached, without the consent and approval by this
Honorable Court;</li></ol>
<p>that on 30 June 1953 the respondent court granted the motion in an
order the dispositive part of which is quoted at the beginning of this
opinion; and that a motion for reconsideration of the order just
referred to on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the trial
(respondent) court was denied;</p>
<p>It is the contention of the petitioner that upon approval or
allowance of the record on appeal the respondent court lost its
jurisdiction over the case and, consequently, the order of 30 June 1953
complained of was entered without jurisdiction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the respondents claim that despite the appeal the
respondent court retains the power "to issue orders for the protection
and preservation of the rights of the parties which do not involve any
matter litigated by the appeal." pursuant to section 9, Rule 41. In
support of their pretense they cite the assignment of errors made by
the petitioner, appellant therein, to wit:</p>
<ol><li>The lower court erred in holding that the consent of
appellant to the waiver of his rights over the varadero on May 5, 1943
(Exhibit G-l) was voluntary and for good consideration and not under
duress;<br><br>
  </li><li> The lower court erred in holding that the appellant had not exercised the option granted by the original lease, Exhibit "A";<br><br>
  </li><li>
The lower court erred in finding that the appellant was a possessor in
bad faith, and the appellees in good faith, for purposes of article 361
of the Civil Code. (Pp. 10-11 appellant's brief, CA-G.R. No. 9376-R,
now SC-GR No. L-7195.)</li></ol>
<p>It would seem that the respondents' theory is that taking into
consideration the assignment of errors of the petitioner, appellant
therein, the directive to the petitioner to deposit with the clerk of
court the accumulated unpaid rentals including interest thereon
amounting to P119,700 and the corresponding rental of the property
every month from 1 May 1953 until the appeal is finally decided, does
not involve a matter litigated in the appeal of the petitioner in the
original action. This contention is not well taken, because if the
consent of the petitioner, appellant therein, to the waiver was not
voluntary and for good consideration but under duress as he contends,
he might be entitled to exercise the option granted in the lease;
because if the petitioner, appellant therein, had exercised the option,
granted as he contends, he would be entitled to continue in possession
of the leased premises; and because if he was a possessor: in good
faith, as he contends, then the judgment of the trial court, which
unfortunately has not been brought to us by the parties but only the
pertinent dispositive part directing the petitioner, appellant therein,
to vacate ,the teased premises and to pay the rentals would have to be
reversed. The accumulated unpaid rentals and interest thereon and the
future rentals of the leased premises are then matters involved and
litigated in the appeal. To order the deposit thereof with the clerk of
court is virtually, if not actually, an execution of the judgment which
the respondent court cannot direct but for good reasons to be stated in
a special order and to be set forth in the record on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
The good reasons do not appear. The order complained of is not the one
contemplated in the rule just referred to because it was issued not
while the case was still within the jurisdiction of the respondent
court. If it be true as contended by the respondent, appellees therein,
that the order of the respondent court complained of was just to
supplement the writ of execution issued against Mercedes H. Vda. de
Hidalgo, intervenor and party-plaintiff therein, who has not appealed
from the judgment rendered against her, then it would be pertinent to
ask why the liability under the judgment of the intervenor and
party-plaintiff who has not appealed from the judgment rendered against
her should be supplemented by making the petitioner, appellant therein,
responsible for her obligation or liability under the judgment? Are
they severally (<em>solidariamente</em>) responsible?</p>
<p>That part of the order which enjoins and prohibits the petitioner,
appellant therein, "to sell, encumber, remove, dismantle or otherwise
dispose of any of the installation, equipments, machineries and motor
vehicles as listed aforesaid, without the consent and approval of this
Court," is not being questioned by the petitioner. It need not be
passed upon.</p>
<p>The order in so far as it directs the petitioner, appellant therein,
to deposit with the clerk of court the accumulated unpaid rentals
including interest thereon in the total amount of P119,700 and the
corresponding rental of the property every month from 1 May 1953 until
the appeal is finally decided, is annulled and set aside for lack of
jurisdiction of the respondent court to enter it, without pronouncement
as to costs.</p>
