<p>On December 3,19S9, respondent Ignacio filed the petition with which said 
election case No. 1326 was initiated, praying for a "recounting" of the votes 
cast in precinct No. 19 of Santiago, Isabela, "and/or correction" of the 
election return (Election Form No. 23) for said precinct, upon the ground that 
he had obtained therein-as candidate for the provincial board as stated in the 
certificate of votes of candidates (Election Form No. 24), issued by the board 
of election inspectors of the aforementioned precinct, copy of which was 
attached to the petition and made an integral part thereof—174 votes, which were 
not included in said election return due to inadvertence, and would affect the 
result of the election. Moreover, Ignacio prayed "that a writ of preliminary 
injunction be issued to restrain the Provincial Board of Canvassers from 
effecting a proclamation pending a determination of the petition." Respondent 
court immediately heard Ignacio and then issued an order, dated December 3, 
1959, from which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. The Board of Election Inspectors in said precinct * * * must appear in 
this Court not later than 2:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, December 4, 1959, and 
make the necessary correction of the clerical mistakes committed by them, if 
they can, in the preparation and accomplishment of Election Form No. 23 so as to 
conform with the true statements made by them on Election Form No. 24 (Annex A), 
in accordance with Section 154 of the Revised Election Code;</p>
<p>"2. If the correction aforesaid could not be effected for valid reason, the 
judicial recounting of the votes cast in favor of Leocadio E. Ignacio be made 
before the court on said date and hour in the presence of all the candidates for 
members of the Provincial Board of Isabela or their respresentative and the 
Chairman of the Provincial Board of Canvassers;</p>
<p>"3. The Municipal Treasurer of Santiago, Isabela must immediately bring to 
the Court on said date and hour the ballot box for valid ballots and the box for 
spoiled ballots used in Precinct No. 19, Santiago, Isabela in the last election 
held on November 10, 1959;</p>
<p>"4. The Provincial Commander, the Provincial Fiscal and the Provincial 
Treasurer of Isabela must bring to this Court on said date and hour the 
corresponding key in their possession of the ballot boxes used in said precinct; 
and</p>
<p>"5. The Chairman of the Provincial Board of Canvassers must bring to the 
Court Election Form No. 23 of said precinct as canvassed by the Provincial Board 
of Canvassers.</p>
<p>"Let the Provincial Sheriff of Isabela, or hig deputy, immediately serve a 
copy of this order upon the parties and the officials concerned by personal 
delivery.</p>
<p>"In order not to render nugatory the purpose of this petition, the petition 
for preliminary writ of injunction is granted, and upon the petitioner filing a 
cash bond in the sum of P100.00, let a writ of preliminary injunction be issued 
restraining the Provincial Board of Canvassers from proclaiming the winning 
candidates until after the correction of said Election Form No. 23 is effected 
or the judicial recounting is terminated."</p></blockquote>
<p>Although Gumpal was neither summoned nor officially notified of this order, 
he appeared at said hearing. So did the chairman and members of the board of 
canvassers, and its poll clerk, all of whom were unanimous in their testimony to 
the effect that Ignacio had obtained in precinct No. 19, as candidate for the 
provincial board, 174 votes; that this is confirmed by the tally sheet used in 
said precinct and the aforementioned certificate of votes of candidates ; that 
owing to inadvertence, they failed to include said votes in the election return 
for said precinct; and that they were willing to make therein the necessary 
correction and/or amendment. On December 7, 1959, the court issued an order, the 
dispositive part of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, pursuant to the provisions of Section 154 of the Revised Election 
Code, the Court hereby order (a) that the Board of Election inspectors in said 
precinct No. 19 of Santiago, Isabela, should correct and/or amend immediately in 
open its statement in Election Form No. 23 (Election Returns No. 23712) * * * by 
inserting and writing thereon the name of the petitioner Leocadio E. Ignacio on 
the space for candidate for member of the Provincial Board, and the 174 votes 
received by him should be written in words and in figures; (b) that after the 
corresponding corrections herein indicated are effected with their corresponding 
initials the said Election Form 23 (Election Returns No. 23712), should be 
returned immediately to the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Isabela which 
should immediately meet and re-canvass and count the true number of votes 
received by petitioner Leocadio Ignacio appearing on the corrected statement 
corresponding said precinct; (c) that upon compliance of this order by the 
Provincial Board of Canvassers, let the writ of preliminary injunction be 
dissolved and petitioner's bond cancelled.</p>
<p>"Let a copy of this order be attached to Election Form No. 23 (Election 
Returns No. 23712), copy for the Provincial Treasurer, and another copies be 
sent, by registered mail, to the Commission on Elections and to the Municipal 
Treasurer of Santiago, Isabela."</p></blockquote>
<p>Herein petitioner Alejandro L. Gumpal, moved for a reconsideration of said 
order, which was denied immediately.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, or on December 10, 1959, the chairman and members of the 
board of election inspectors of precinct No. 23 of Santiago, Isabela, as well as 
its poll clerk, filed a verified petition, which was docketed as Election Case 
No. 1330 of the court aforementioned, stating that, during the canvass being 
made by the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Isabela, they came to know that, 
according to the election return for said precinct No. 23, respondent Ignacio 
had obtained therein one hundred-four-teen (114) votes, which is, however, 
"untruthful", for "in fact and in truth"—as evidenced by a certificate of votes 
of candidates issued by said board of election inspectors, and attached to and 
made an integral part of the petition— said respondent had received and obtained 
one hundred forty (140) votes, and praying that said board of election 
inspectors be authorized 'to correct and/or amend" its aforesaid election return 
"by inserting * * * in the proper space * * * 'One Hundred Forty * * * 140' 
opposite and/or following the name of candidate Leocadio Ignacio."</p>
<p>Alejandro L. Gumpal was neither served with copy of the petition in said case 
No. 1330 nor notified of its hearing, which took place on the same day. On that 
occasion everyone of the petitioners therein took the witness stand and 
testified that Ignacio had obtained, in said precinct No. 23 of Santiago, 
Isabela, one hundred forty (140) votes, as attested to in the certificate of 
votes of candidates above referred to, which was copied from the tally sheet 
deposited in the corresponding ballot box; that they had committed an honest 
mistake in the preparation of the election return, by erroneously writing 
thereon "one hundred fourteen 114", instead of " one hundred forty 140"; and 
that they were willing to rectify such mistake, which was due to inadvertence on 
their part. Thereupon, respondent court issued an order granting the petition in 
said case. A motion for reconsideration, filed by petitioner Gumpal on December 
11, 1959, was denied on the same date. </p>
<p>Thereupon, the Provincial Board of Canvassers completed the canvass of the 
votes cast for members of the Provincial Board of Isabela, relying, insofar as 
precincts Nos. 19 and 23 of Santiago were concerned, upon the election returns 
thereof as corrected in pursuance of the proceedings aforementioned, and 
proclaimed Felicisima Cabasal Pinpin, Gabriel E. Visaya and respondent Leocadio 
E. Ignacio as the elected members of the Provincial Board of Isabela, with 
46,049, 33,336 and 32,903 votes, respectively, thus giving herein appellant, 
Leocadio B. Ignacio, a plurality of ten (10) votes over his closest opponent, 
petitioner Gumpal, who was credited with 32,893 votes. On December 23, 1959, 
petitioner Gumpal filed: (a) a "petition for protest" docketed as Election Case 
No. BR-II-I of the Court of First Instance of Isabela—contesting the election of 
Ignacio as third member of the Provincial Board of Isabela; and (b) the 
petitions herein docketed as G.R. No. L-16409, as to precinct No. 23, and G. R. 
No. L-16416, as to precinct No. 19, against said court, first branch, the 
Provincial Board of Canvassers of Isabela, the Board of Election Inspectors of 
Precinct No. 23 (in case G.R. No. L-16409), and the aforementioned Leocadio E. 
Ignacio. Subsequently, or on January 1, 1960, the latter assumed office as 
member of the Provincial Board of Isabela. ;</p>
<p>The two (2) cases before us (L-16409 and L-16416) have been jointly heard, 
owing to the intimate relation between both, for which reason only one decision 
will be rendered therein. Petitioner Gumpal maintains: '</p>
<p>I. That the board of election inspectors for precinct No. 23 of Isabela may 
not file, pursuant to the provisions of section 154 of the Revised Election 
Code, a petition for the correction of its election return (Form No. 23), "after 
this statement had already been canvassed by the Provincial Board of 
Canvassers."</p>
<p>II. That a petition for correction, under section 154 of the Revised Election 
Code, may not be heard and resolved without notice to the other affected 
candidates, when the correction sought to be made will materially affect the 
result of the election.</p>
<p>III. That an affected candidate may not validly file a petition for 
correction under the provisions of section 154 of the Revised Election Code, or 
the filing of a petition under this provisions is limited to the board of 
election inspectors.</p>
<p>IV. That a court of record may not validly apply the provisions of section 
154 of the Revised Election Code to a petition for recounting of votes filed by 
an affected candidate.</p>
<p>V. That a court of record may not validly decide a petition for recounting of 
votes filed by an affected candidate without actually recounting the votes in 
question.</p>
<p>VI. That a court of record may not validly take cognizance of, hear and 
decide a petition for recounting of votes filed by an affected candidate without 
notice of said proceeding having been properly given to all candidates 
affected.</p>
<p>VII. That the First Branch of the Court of First Instance of Isabela may not 
validly take cognizance of a case which originated or came from the Municipality 
of Santiago, Province of Isabela, without the previous approval of the 
Department of Justice, in the light of this Department's Administrative Order 
No. 17, T, dated January 20, 1955.</p>
<p>VIII. That an alleged discrepancy between what appears in Election Form No. 
23 (Election return) and what appears in Election Form No. 24 (certificate of 
votes of candidates, issued by boards of election inspectors to watchers under 
Section 153 of the Revised Election Code) may not constitute a sufficient legal 
ground for a court to order the correction of the entries appearing in Election 
Form No. 23, to make the entries in this statement conform to the entries in 
Election Form No. 24.</p>
<p>1. Petitioner assumes that Election Case No. 1830 was instituted after the 
<em>return</em> for precinct No. 23 had been <em>canvassed</em> by the 
provincial board of canvassers. However, the latter is charged by law (Sec. 160, 
Republic Act No. 180) with the duty to make a canvass, not of the <em>"election 
return"</em> for each <em>precinct</em>, but "of all the <em>votes</em> cast in 
the <em>province</em> for national, provincial and city candidates", and such 
duty is not deemed complied with until: (1) <em>"upon completion</em> of the 
canvass * * * <em>separate</em> <em>statements</em> of all the votes received" 
by said candidate shall have been <em>made</em>; and (2) the board shall have 
<em>proclaimed</em>, in accordance with said statements, "who has been elected 
to the House of Representatives from each legislative district and who has been 
elected to each provincial and city office." The Provincial Board of Canvassers 
of Isabela took these two (2) steps, insofar as the Provincial Board of Isabela 
was concerned, in the afternoon of December 11, 1959, after respondent court had 
issued the order granting the petition in election case No. 1330, and denied the 
motion for reconsideration therein filed by herein petitioner, Alejandro L. 
Gumpal.</p>
<p>If the latter intends to question the feasibility of correcting an election 
return, after its examination by the provincial board of canvassers, but before 
its aforementioned task has been fully discharged, then petitioner's pretense is 
belied by sections 162 and 163 of Republic Act No. 180, reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 162. <em>Material defects in form of the statements</em>.—If it should 
clearly appear that some requisite in form has been omitted in the statements, 
the board shall return them by messenger or by another more expeditious means, 
to the corresponding boards of inspectors for correction. Said statements, 
however, shall not be returned for a recount of the ballots or for any 
alteration of the number of votes set forth therein.</p>
<p>"Sec- 163. <em>When statements of a precinct are contradictory.</em>—In ease 
it appears to the provincial board of canvassers that another copy or other 
authentic copies of the statement from an election precinct submitted to the 
board give to a candidate a different number of votes and the difference affects 
the result of the election, the Court of First Instance of the province, upon 
motion of the board or of any candidate affected, may proceed to recount the 
votes cast in the precinct for the sole purpose of determining which is the true 
statement or which is the true result of the count of the votes cast in said 
precinct for the office in question. Notice of such proceeding shall 'be given 
to all candidates affected."</p></blockquote>
<p>The correction mentioned in section 162 and that which may be required by the 
result of the recount authorized in Section 163, could only take place 
<em>after</em> the corresponding election return has been examined by the board 
of canvassers.</p>
<p>Petitioner cites, in support of his pretense, section 154 of Republic Act No. 
180, which we quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After the announcement of the result of the election in the polling place, 
.the board of inspectors shall not make any alteration or. amendment in any of 
its statements, unless it be so ordered by a competent court."</p></blockquote>
<p>This provision contains, however, nothing that would bear out petitioner's 
claim.</p>
<p>2. Section 154 above quoted does not require notice upon tile candidates. The 
absence of such requirement becomes significant when contrasted with the last 
sentence of section 163 specifically directing that notice of the proceedings 
for the recounting of votes be "given to all candidates affected."</p>
<p>It is true that, as stated by petitioner herein, "the summary nature of the 
proceedings under section 154 does not preclude notice to other affected 
candidates if the alteration or amendment sought to be made would materially 
affect the election". Indeed, it would be a good practice to require such notice 
in appropriate cases, particularly when there is sufficient time therefor and 
there are circumstances indicating that the allegations of the petition for 
correction may not be entirely truthful. In election case No. 1330, however, no 
such time was available, for the fifteen (15) days within whRSl' the Board of 
Canvassers was required by section 160 of Republic Act No. 180 to discharge its 
duties had expired on November 26, 1959, or fourteen (14) days prior to the 
institution of said case.</p>
<p>Neither were the circumstances above referred to present in said election 
case No. 1330. On the contrary, all indications pointed to the veracity of the 
petition therein. Thus: (a) the petition was subscribed and sworn to by the 
chairman (a public school teacher) and members of the board of election 
inspectors of precinct No. 23—including inspector Miguela C. Gabriel, who 
represented the Nacionalista Party, to which Gumpal belongs—and the poll clerk 
(another teacher) ; (b) the petition was corroborated by a certificate of votes 
of candidates, issued by said board of election inspectors; (c) it was fully 
substantiated by the testimony of the chairman, the members of said board and 
its poll clerk; and (d) it is in accord with the normal course of events for, 
considering that numbers one-hundred fourteen (114) and one-hundred forty (140) 
are <em>idem sonans</em>, as well as possible deficiencies in pronounciation (as 
testified by said witnesses), it is not unlikely that the one may have been 
mistaken for the other. In this connection, it is interesting to note that, in 
the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner herein in election case No. 
1330, he did not deny the truth, either of the allegations of the petition in 
that case, or of'the testiVnony therein introduced in evidence, as set forth in 
the appealed order of respondent court, dated December 10, 1959.</p>
<p>3. Section 154 of the Revised Election Code does not specify the party who 
may institute the proceedings therein contemplated. Upon the other hand, it is 
already well settled that the alteration therein provided may not be sanctioned 
unless the members of the corresponding board of election inspectors are 
unanimous on the existence of an error in the return and are wiling to rectify 
the same. (Benitez vs. Paredes and Dizon, 52 Phil., 1; Board of Inspectors of 
Bongabong, vs. Sison, 55 Phil. 914.) So long, therefore, as these conditions are 
present and the proceedings have been instituted by a party who has a 
justiciable interest in the matter, the court may authorize the aforementioned 
correction. A candidate affected by the alleged mistake has such justiciable 
interest.</p>
<p>4. Petitioner herein assumes that election case No. 1326 was instituted for 
the sole purpose of securing a "recounting" of the votes cast in precinct No. 19 
of Santiago, Isabela. Such assumption ft belied by the record of said case. It 
was alleged in the petition therein that the one-hundred seventy-four (174) 
votes allegedly obtained by Ig-nacio in said precinct were "inadvertently 
omitted" from the election return, and Ignacio prayed in said petition that "a 
recount of the votes cast in precinct No. 19 of Santiago, Isabela, <em>and/or 
correction</em> of the Election Form No. 23 for said precinct be made." 
Moreover, the order of respondent court, dated December 7, 1959, authorizing 
said correction, expressly relied upon section 154 of Republic Act No. 180. In 
other words, the petition in said case sought, also, the correction of said 
election return.</p>
<p>5. Although the petition in election case No. 1326 was for a "recounting 
and/or correction" of election return, the order of respondent court disposing 
of the case was limited to the second alternative. The court did not act, 
therefore, on the matter of recounting, the same having become moot.</p>
<p>6. Respondent court did not "take cognizance of, hear and decide a petition 
for recounting," in ejection case No. 1326. It heard and decided the same, 
insofar only as the petition for "correction" was concerned. Hence, the 
provisions of section 163 of Republic Act No. 180, relative to the procedure for 
a "recounting", are inapplicable to test the legality of the proceedings in the 
lower court or the wisdom of the action taken by the same. At any rate, 
petitioner was actually present at the hearing of said case on December 4, 1959, 
and was duly represented by Attorneys Antonio M. Orara and Buenaventura Baccay, 
who cross-examined the witnesses and otherwise participated actively in the 
proceeding. After the presentation of the evidence for the petitioner in said 
election case No. 1326, petitioner herein did not offer to introduce any 
evidence. In short, he had every opportunity to present his side of the case, 
and made use of it.</p>
<p>7. On January 22, 1955, the Department of Justice issued Administrative Order 
No. 17, T, distributing the cases coming from the different municipalities of 
the province of Isabela between the two branches of the court of first instance 
thereof. Said order provided, also, that "whenever the interest of the 
administration of justice so requires, either of the two Judges may try any case 
coming from any municipality, with the previous approval of this Department." 
Election cases Nos. 1326 and 1330 were heard and decided by the Judge presiding 
the first branch of said court, with station in Ilagan, without previous 
departmental approval, although, pursuant to said Administrative Order No. 17, 
T, cases coming from the municipality of Santiago are cognizable by the Judge of 
the second branch, with station in Cauayan. It is trite to say, however, that 
the validity of a given judicial action is dependent upon the jurisdiction of 
the court taking it, and that, by specific constitutional mandate, "the power to 
define, prescribe and apportion the jurisdiction of the various courts" is, 
subject to the limitations set forth in the fundamental law, within the 
exclusive province of Congress. Since, being legislative, said power cannot be 
delegated to the Secretary of Justice, the aforementioned Administrative Order 
No. 17, T, must be construed, not as a limitation upon the <em>jurisdiction</em> 
of either branch of the Court of First Instance of Isabela, but, as an 
<em>administrative</em> measure tending to regulate the <em>exercise</em> of 
said jurisdiction. No matter, therefore, how reprehensible or suspicious the 
action of respondent court may have been in taking cognizance of said cases Nos. 
1326 and 1330, without previous approval of the Department of Justice, the 
validity of the orders complained of is unaffected thereby.'</p>
<p>8. Petitioner herein assumes that these orders are based upon the discrepancy 
between the election returns on the one hand and the certificates of votes of 
candidates on the other. In fact, however, said orders were predicated upon the 
unanimous testimony of the members of the board of election inspectors and the 
poll clerks of precincts Nos. 19 and 23 of Santiago, Isabela. The certificates 
of votes of the candidates merely corroborated said testimony and indicated the 
veracity thereof. Said documentary corroboration, was not indispensable for said 
testimony to warrant the correction of the returns. Hence, instead of impairing 
the validity of the orders complained of, the existence of such corroboration 
tends to bolster up the wisdom of said orders.</p>
<p>Considering lastly, that petitioner herein has filed a protest contesting the 
proclamation and/or election of respondent Ignacio as member of the Provincial 
Board of Isabela, and praying that he (petitioner) be declared the one elected 
to said board, in lieu of respondent Ignacio, and that the latter has already 
assumed office as member of the board and is discharging his duties as such, 
petitioner herein should seek his relief in the aforementioned protest, not in 
his present petitions for mandamus and certiorari (The Municipal Board of 
Canvassers, Borongan, Samar, et al. <em>vs</em>. Hon. Emilio Benitez, et al., 
L-16319 [promulgated June 30, 1960]).</p>
<p>Wherefore, said petitions are hereby dismissed, with costs against petitioner 
herein. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., Barrera, 
Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petitions dismissed</em>.</p></div>
