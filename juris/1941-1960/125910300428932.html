				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal  from an order of the Court  of First Instance of  Manila  dismissing  plaintiff's  complaints  in Civil Cases  No's. 26343,  26344,  26404, 26405, 26406  and 26442 "without prejudice to the filing of  other complaints, should  the plaintiff so desire."</p>
<p>In said civil cases, which were originally  filed  before the Municipal Court  of Manila, plaintiff,  a mechanic-operator, seeks  to recover the amount of P650.00,  for Injuries to his left hand causing  temporary total disability, from six different  insurance companies with which he  had entered into  contracts  of insurance  against  death or  disability caused by accidental means. N Judgment  having been rendered in plaintiff's faVor,  all six defendants  appealed to the  Court of First Instance of  Manila,  the complaint against defendant Filipinas Cia.  de Seguros being reproduced in Civil Case No. 26343  (G. R. No.  L-15928), that against People's  Surety &amp; Ins.  Co.,  Inc.,  in Civil  Case No. 26344 (G. R. No. L-15929),  that against South Sea Surety &amp; Ins. Co., Inc., in Civil  Case No. 26404  (G. R. No. L-15930), that against the Philippine  Guaranty Co., Inc., in Civil Case No. 26405 (G. R.  No. L-15931), that against Universal Insurance &amp;  Indemnity  Co., in  Civil Case No. 26406  (G.  R. No. L-15932)  and that against Plaridel Surety &amp; Ins. Co., Inc., in Civil Case No. 26442 (G. R. No. L-15933).</p>
<p>As the cases involve a common question of fact and of law, they were assigned to one  Judge  for joint  trial. On July 31, 1956, the day set for hearing, plaintiff  testified and was cross-examined by  counsel for defendants. However, the cross-examination was not finished and continuance of hearing was set for August 30, 1956.  In the morning  of  that day, when the  cases were called for hearing,  defendants  thru counsel  manifested  that they were ready for  trial.  But  as  plaintiff had not yet arrived and was, according to his counsel,  "probably just delayed," the lower court informed said counsel that the cases would  be called for hearing again 'in 10:30 of the same morning.   As plaintiff was still  absent when the cases were called at said hour, the lower court on  that same day issued an order dismissing plaintiff's complaints but  without prejudice,  as already  stated, to the  filing of other complaints should plaintiff so desire.</p>
<p>On September 26, 1956, plaintiff's counsel filed a motion praying that the order of dismissal be set aside, it  being alleged that plaintiff's failure to appear  at the hearing was due to  sickness as  he  was  then suffering from influenza with acute bronchitis and his doctor advised him to  rest in bed  for  about six days.  Although  plaintiff's affidavit of merit and the sworn  statement of his attending physician were  attached  to the motion in support thereof, the same was denied.   Whereupon, plaintiff appealed  to the  Court  of Appeals  alleging  as his lone assignment of error  that  "the lower  court erred in dismissing  the cases notwithstanding the accidental or excusable absence  of  the  plaintiff at  the  trial."  As the question involved is purely legal, the appeal was certified to this Court.                                   .</p>
<p>After  going  over the records,  we do  not think the motion to  set aside the order of dismissal was properly overruled.   Said motion, which Van only be considered as a petition for relief  under Rule 38,  was admittedly filed within the reglementary period prescribed  and was accompanied by an affidavit of merit which tends to show that plaintiff has a  good and substantial  cause of action. Indeed, the judgment rendered by the inferior court, was in his favor.  It is,  likewise, undisputed that  plaintiff, as stated by him in his affidavit, was at  the  time of the hearing, sick and confined  in bed.  He further explained that he  wanted to  send  his  wife  to inform  his counsel, but  he was afraid  she would only get lost  as she was not  familiar with the places  in  Manila  much less his counsel's office.  These circumstances, in our opinion, constitute sufficient ground to warrant the reopening of the cases,  if for  no other purpose than to  give plaintiff  a chance to  submit evidence in support of  his  claims.  A slight  delay in the adjudication of the cases occasioned by a reasonably justified continuance of the hearing thereof to afford plaintiff  the opportunity to present his evidence  would  certainly not materially prejudice  the defendant  insurance companies.  On  the contrary,  it is in consonance with fairplay and justice.</p>
<p>Moreover, we really see  no practical advantage either to the parties or to the court for the cases to be dismissed only to  allow plaintiff, to file anew the same complaints "should  he so  desire."  A  continuance  of the  hearing would have been more in accord or consistent with justice, especially  since the  plaintiff  is a poor man and is prosecuting these cases  as a pauper.</p>
<p>In  view of the foregoing, the order of dismissal complained of is hereby set aside and the records of the cases remanded to the trial court for further  proceedings.  So ordered without costs.</p>
