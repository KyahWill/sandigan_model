				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff brought this action against defendants in the Court of First Instance  of Davao seeking the reconveyance  of  a parcel  of  land situated  at Bansalan, Davao which was allegedly acquired by the  latter through fraud. This property is covered by a certificate of title issued by the Register of Deeds of Davao on July 26, 1955 pursuant to a  homestead patent issued by the  Director of Lands on April 11,  1955. <br><br>Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on  the  grounds (1)  that there is another  action pending  between the same parties  in the Office of  the Bureau  of Lands regarding  the same property;  and (2) that the complaint states no cause of  action.  Plaintiff opposed in writing this motion to dismiss stating, among the reasons relied upon for its  denial, the fact that  plaintiff has already withdrawn the motion for  reconsideration he had filed with  the Director of Lands  so that  the action mentioned therein as pending between  the parties has  already become moot. <br><br>The court  in an order issued on August 31, 1956 sustained the motion holding that, in the light of the allegations of the  complaint, the same in its opinion does not state facts sufficient to constitute a  cause of action, and, consequently, dismissed the complaint without pronouncement as  to costs.   In due time plaintiff directly appealed to this Court raising purely questions of law. <br><br>It  is alleged in the complaint  that on  September  9, 1929, one Cobalan (Bagobo)  was in possession of a portion  of  agricultural land situated  at Bansalan,  Davao, containing an  area of 14 hectares more or less; that he applied for the acquisition   of  said land  as  homestead from the Bureau of Lands, and after complying with the requirements  regarding possession and  cultivation, said Bureau issued an order on June 22, 1940 directing the issuance  of a patent for said land in favor  of Cobalan; that Cobalan died intestate in September, 1945 while his wife  died also intestate in April,  1946, leaving as heirs the following children:  Trining Cobalan,  20  years old; Damayuan Cobalan, 18 years old; and Hat  Cobalan,  16 years old; that sometime in  1949  intestate  proceedings were instituted for the settlement of the estate of Cobalan wherein plaintiff was appointed as  judicial administrator; that after the death of the spouses above-mentioned, one Perfecto Diray,  taking advantage of  the minority  of Cobalan's  heirs,  illegally occupied the land in question and wrote  a  letter  to the  Director  of Lands  wherein he fraudulently misrepresented that Cobalan  and  his entire family were killed during  the Japanese occupation after the former had  sold his homestead rights  over the controverted  land to one Maxima Guilaran and praying that the order  granting to Cobalan the said property as homestead be set aside and the same be adjudicated to the heirs of one Felix Alivio who has also filed an application for homestead with regard to the same property; that by reason of  said  misrepresentation,  defendants  succeeded in having  the application  of Cobalan  cancelled,  instead were able  to secure the approval  of the application of Felix Alivio and the consequent issuance of a  patent in their favor and  of the corresponding certificate of title from the Register of Deeds of Davao; and that  by reason of the fraud practised upon  them  by defendants, they pray that the  latter be ordered to  reconvey to  the heirs of the deceased Cobalan the property in question and to pay damages in the amount of  P18,536.00. <br><br>In dismissing the complaint on the ground that it does not state sufficient  cause of action,  the lower court made the following pronouncement: <br><blockquote>"The second question to determine is whether the complaint, as asserted by the defendants in their second ground for their motion to  dismiss, state no cause of action.  It will be observed that the plaintiff in his complaint no where asserts  that he is the 'owner' of the property involved in  this litigation.  All that he claims is that this  property formed  part of a homestead, applied for by his predecessor in interest, the deceased Cobalan (Bagobo), in whose favor the Director of Lands has allegedly issued an order sometime on June 22, 1940 for the issuance of a  patent. <br><br>"The action of  reconveyance  of  a  property, that  is  already covered by a Torrens Title, under the Land Registration Act, may only be maintained by  the 'owner'  of the property  who has been prejudiced by the actual fraud imputed  to him, who succeeded in securing the  registration of the said property in his name.  Thus Sec. 55 of the  Land Registration Act  in its pertinent provision reads as follows:<br><br>'That in all cases  of  registration procured by fraud the owner may pursue  all his legal and  equitable  remedies  against  the parties to such fraud, without prejudice, however, to the rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of title.' <br><br>Is the herein plaintiff  'the  owner'  of  the property in litigation within the contemplation of  the Land Registration Act such  that he may avail  of  the remedies provided  for in Section 55 thereof? If he is  not, then even if  it should develop in this case that  the registered owner of this  property, the herein defendants,  secured the registration  thereof through actual fraud, the Court cannot direct the reconveyance  of the said property to him, because  insofar as he is  concerned, he has not yet  acquired the private ownership of this property since all the right that he claims therein is that of a mere  homestead applicant.   Whether or  not  such a right in  expectancy may  ripen into one of absolute ownership  is for the Bureau of Lands to pass  upon in the  exercise of the  administrative powers conferred  on it  by  Commonwealth Act No. 141,  the  Public Land  Act.  And this may only be feasible if the property is caused to be reverted to the Government as part of the public domain under the provisions of  Sections 91 and 124 of the Public Land Act."<br><br>We find  no  error in the  above findings  of  the trial court.  Indeed, in  order that the  heirs of Cobalan  may claim reconveyance of the property in their favor there is need  for them  to show <span style="font-style: italic;">that they are the owners thereof</span> but that  they had been  deprived of its ownership and possession through fraud practised  by defendants.   The complaint does not show nor claim that they are the owners of the property,  for it merely alleges that their father Cobalan  applied for  the property as homestead  from  the Bureau  of Lands and that after complying  with the requirements of the law an order was issued  directing the issuance  of the  patent  to Cobalan.  But the complaint also shows that this order was later set aside by the Bureau  of Lands in  view of  an alleged misrepresentation made  by  one Perfecto Diray in behalf  of  the heirs of Felix Alivio, and  that said order became final when plaintiff withdrew the motion  for reconsideration  he had filed when he  learned  of the existence of such order.  Indeed, the order  of the Director of Lands above adverted to was issued on  November 5, 1954, and it reads as follows: <br><br>"As upon investigation conducted  by  a representative of this Office  it has been found  out that applicant Cobalan (Bagobo) has relinquished for valuable  consideration his right and  interests  in the land covered by  his above  application in favor  of  Maxima Guilaran, his Homestead Application No. 151923,  (E-60033)  is hereby cancelled forfeiting in favor  of the government whatever amount  has been paid on account thereof. <br><br>"SO ORDERED. <br><br>"November 5 (15),  1954. <br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(S/t) VICENTE TORDESILLAS <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Asst. Director </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">AC/ajm" </span></div></blockquote></div><div align="justify">The  step taken by  the heirs  of  the deceased  Cobalan in presenting a motion for reconsideration before the Director of Lands seeking to set aside his order of November 5, 1954 was the most  appropriate under the circumstances for it was the occasion for them to  prove that defendants succeeded in cancelling the interest of their predecessor-in-interest through fraudulent  misrepresentation  for which reason they were not given their day  in  court.  It is true  that the order of cancellation was predicated  upon the ground that Cobalan violated the law when he transferred his homestead rights over the  property for valuable consideration  without official  approval, but they can also disprove the truth of such claim, as they now try to do, by showing that what their father did was not to transfer but merely to mortgage his interest  in the property; but all such opportunity was wasted when they withdrew the motion for reconsideration apparently in the belief  that it was no longer necessary in view of  the pendency of the present  case in the  Court of  First  Instance  of Davao. Under our law and precedents on the  matter, that motion was necessary if they wanted to obtain a reconsideration of the order of the Director of Lands  and if the ruling is adverse, their remedy  is  to  appeal to the Secretary  of Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources.   They should  first exhaust their administrative remedies  before bringing the matter to court (Miguel vs. Reyes, 93 Phil., 542; Lachica vs. Ducusin,  102 Phil., 551).   As the situation now stands, we find no other alternative than to conclude that the court a quo did not err in dismissing the complaint on the ground that it does not state a cause  of action.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, without prejudice to whatever administrative  action the  heirs  of Cobalan may desire to take under the  law in the  Office  of the Bureau of Lands in view of their claim of fraud allegedly practised by defendants.  No pronouncement as  to costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.  J., Bengzon,  Reyes,  A.,  Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
