				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiff filed an action in the Court of&nbsp;First Instance of&nbsp;Manila&nbsp;against the&nbsp;Price Stabilization Corporation (Prisco) praying that the Manager&nbsp;of the defendant,&nbsp;or the person acting in his place, be ordered to immediately issue to plaintiff&nbsp;a monthly quota allocation and import license for 7,918 bags of wheat flour commencing the month of August,&nbsp;1950,&nbsp;under&nbsp;the provisions&nbsp;of&nbsp;section 12&nbsp;of Republic Act No. 426.<br><br>Plaintiff is an old importer duly&nbsp;licensed to do business in the Philippines.&nbsp;It has been importing Wheat flour into the Philippines since the year 1890, and was&nbsp;duly registered with the Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabilitation&nbsp;(Pratra), predecessor of the defendant Prisco, for quota allocation of wheat&nbsp;flour and&nbsp;for licensing.<br><br>Plaintiff contends that under the provisions of sections 12 and 14 of Republic&nbsp;Act No.&nbsp;426, 70 per cent&nbsp;of&nbsp;the total import quota of wheat flour for the year 1950-51 shall be allocated to old importers and 30 per cent thereof shall be allocated to new importers; that as an old importer, it is entitled to a yearly&nbsp;quota&nbsp;allocation of 96,016 bags of wheat flour, or 7,918 bags per month, on the basis laid down by&nbsp;sections&nbsp;12 and 14 of Republic Act No.&nbsp;426; and that,&nbsp;when it&nbsp;requested&nbsp;the defendant to&nbsp;issue in its favor the&nbsp;corresponding&nbsp;quota allocation&nbsp;and import license for&nbsp;wheat&nbsp;flour&nbsp;as&nbsp;above&nbsp;mentioned, defendant refused to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so,&nbsp;whereupon&nbsp;it instituted the&nbsp;present action.<br><br>Defendant, on the other hand, eontends&nbsp;that under section 15 of Republic Act No. 426, it has the&nbsp;exclusive power and&nbsp;authority&nbsp;to&nbsp;determine&nbsp;and&nbsp;regulate the&nbsp;allocation of wheat flour among importers; that it has been allocating wheat flour in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order No.&nbsp;305 and the rules&nbsp;and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Wheat Flour Board; and that, in allocating wheat flour which our Government is&nbsp;entitled to purchase under the International Wheat Agreement, it is not subject to the restrictions imposed by sections 12 and 14 of Republic Act No. 426.<br><br>After due trial, the court rendered judgment for plaintiff holding in its dispositive part:<br><br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp;That the provisions of&nbsp;Sections 12&nbsp;and 14, of&nbsp;Republic Act 426 are applicable&nbsp;to the defendant and Price&nbsp;Stabilization&nbsp;Corporation, otherwise&nbsp;known as PRISCO;<br><br>"2.&nbsp;That under the&nbsp;provisions of Sections&nbsp;12 and 14 of Republic Act No. 426, plaintiff is entitled&nbsp;to a&nbsp;yearly quota&nbsp;allocation of 96,016 bags of wheat flour, or 7,918 bags per month, and the defendant PRISCO is hereby ordered to&nbsp;give plaintiff such monthly quota allocation, commencing the month&nbsp;of&nbsp;August,&nbsp;1950;<br><br>"3.&nbsp;That 'new importers',&nbsp;as defined in Section&nbsp;1&nbsp;of Republic Act No. 426, are&nbsp;not entitled to wheat&nbsp;flour quota allocation unless they come and qualify&nbsp;under&nbsp;the&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;of Section 14 of the Act; and<br><br>"4. The defendant PRISCO is hereby ordered to stop or discontinue the wheat flour quota allocations&nbsp;given by its predecessors, PRATRA,&nbsp;to new importers who did&nbsp;not&nbsp;come&nbsp;or&nbsp;qualify under the provisions of&nbsp;Section&nbsp;14 of&nbsp;Republic Act No. 426, and&nbsp;that the wheat flour allocated to&nbsp;the said&nbsp;unqualified&nbsp;importers be&nbsp;allocated to the 'old importers', as defined&nbsp;in Section 14 of the&nbsp;Act.<br><br>No costs are allowed."</blockquote><p>From this judgment defendant&nbsp;appealed, assigning as lone error the following:<br><br></p><blockquote>"The lower court erred in holding that the Pratra,&nbsp;and now its successor the defendant-appellant, in allocating the wheat flour in question among importers, ia subject to&nbsp;the restrictions established by Sections&nbsp;12 and 14 of Republic Act No. 426."</blockquote><p>The only&nbsp;issue involved&nbsp;in&nbsp;this case&nbsp;is whether the Pratra,&nbsp;now&nbsp;Prisco,&nbsp;shall make the allocation of import quota on wheat flour m accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 426, as claimed by the appellee, or shall make such allocation in accordance with sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order No. 305, in conjunction with section 15 of Republic Act No. 426, as claimed by the appellant.<br><br>This is the same issue which this Court had occasion to consider and pass upon in Chinese Flour Importers Association,Manila, Philippines, <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Price Stabilization Board (Prisco) and Philippine Wheat Flour Board, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>,&nbsp;p. 439.<br><br>In that&nbsp;case, we discussed at length&nbsp;the import of the provisions&nbsp;of section 15 of Republic Act No. 426, particularly the&nbsp;effect of the proviso included therein which, as contended by appellant, operates as an exception to exclude wheat flour from the provisions of the Act.&nbsp;We there held that said proviso has no other meaning than that the function of allocating wheat flour instead of being assigned to the Import Control Commissioner was assigned&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Pratra which&nbsp;heretofore has been charged&nbsp;with said duty by Executive&nbsp;Order No. 305,&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;if the&nbsp;intention of Congress is to exempt wheat flour from the provisions of Republic Act No. 426, an exception to that effect would have been&nbsp;stated in section 22,&nbsp;which contains&nbsp;the repealing clause.&nbsp;We also said that the exclusion of wheat flour from appendix "C" of Republic Act No. 426 does not necessarily indicate an intention to remove&nbsp;it from the scope and operation of said Act,&nbsp;but was done merely to&nbsp;convey the idea that the&nbsp;amount of wheat flour&nbsp;which&nbsp;may be imported&nbsp;into the Philippines and its price are already fixed and&nbsp;determined in the&nbsp;International Wheat Agreement.&nbsp;We finally said that to interpret Republic Act No. 426 as&nbsp;excluding&nbsp;wheat flour&nbsp;from its operation would be tantamount to an undue delegation of powers to the Pratra which&nbsp;would render the Act unconstitutional and void, as&nbsp;it would vest&nbsp;in an administrative officer an arbitrary discretion&nbsp;to be exercised without any policy rule or standard by&nbsp;which it can be measured or controlled.&nbsp;We concluded&nbsp;that while the allocation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;import quota of wheat flour is given by section 15 of Republic Act No. 426, to the PRATRA,&nbsp;now PRISCO, such allocation has to be made in accordance with the pattern laid down in sections 12&nbsp;and&nbsp;14 of said Act.&nbsp;We held that these findings and conclusions fully apply and are decisive of the present case.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby affirmed, without pronouncement as to&nbsp;costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.&nbsp;J., Feria,&nbsp;Pablo, Bengzon,&nbsp;Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor</span> and&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Jugo,&nbsp;JJ., </span>concur<br></p></div>
