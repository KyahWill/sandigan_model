				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>In the Pampanga court of first instance in November 1956, Ponciano S. Reyes, petitioned for administration of the estate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> left by his deceased mother, Raymunda Soriano, a resident of Arayat, Pampanga.</p>
<p>Opposing the petition, Simplicia Reyes Berenguer, moved for dismissal due to improper venue, since the deceased had become a resident of Quezon City at the time of her death.</p>
<p>The petitioner insisted that the deceased never abandoned her permanent residence in Arayat.</p>
<p>After hearing the parties, and considering evidence, the Court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>
<p>Whereupon, oppositor appealed to this Court.</p>
<p>The Rules do not allow this appeal. Sec. 1 of Rule 105, enumerates the instances wherein an appeal may be taken in special proceedings. This is not one of them.</p>
<p>Lest it be argued that this is a ''final order or judgment", or a "final determination of the rights" of the person appealing, under subsection (e) and (f) of the above section, it may be explained that we have held in previous rulings that a decree denying a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction—not venue only as in this case—is not appealable, because it is only, interlocutory, and not a final order in the litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>Wherefore, this appeal is hereby dismissed, with costs against appellant.</p>
<p><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista, Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,, Endencia,</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
