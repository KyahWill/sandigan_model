				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Policarpio Katangkatang and Gonzalo Hembra were, together with four
 unknown persons, accused of robbery in band with double homicide in the
 Court of First Instance of Leyte.  As the four unknown persons were not
 apprehended, Policarpio Katangkatang and Gonzalo Hembra were tried 
alone and, having been found guilty as charged and sentenced to death, 
indemnity and costs, they have appealed to the Court of Appeals, but 
because of the nature of the penalty, the case has been elevated to this
 Court.
  <p>    From the evidence for the prosecution it appears that on the 
night of October 21, 1950, Luis Grana, his wife Victoria Cahinde, and 
their two sons Juan and Crestituto were in their house in barrio 
Villapas, Jaro, Leyte.  With them were their guest Sotera Ca単ezo and her
 three little children.  At about 8 o'clock that evening those in the 
house became aware of the approach of strangers, because of the barking 
of dogs, and very soon heard footsteps outside and voices saying: "Padi,
 Padi Luis, abrehi ako, tague sapi" (Compadre, Compadre Luis, let in, 
give me money).  As no one in the house gave reply, those below fired 
shots in the air and tried to open the main door, but failing to do so, 
they went to the door of the kitchen and opened it by cutting the rope 
by which it was secured.  Then two armed men, identified as the 
appellants herein, entered.  They had their faces covered with 
handkerchiefs from the nose down.  Addressing Luis Grana they asked him 
for money, and when he refused, he was fired upon by the appellant 
Policarpio Katangkatang.  He was hit in the neck, but he did not die at 
once.  Seeing that further resistance was useless, Luis Grana got out 
P200 from his pocket and handed it to the appellants, and thereafter 
remarked: "Now I know that you were the same ones who had robbed us 
before." Believing obviously that he and his companion had been 
recognized, Katangkatang shot Luis in the stomach, killing him.  
Thereafter, the other inmates of the house were ordered to lie on the 
floor face down, including Crestituto, who was already wounded.  And as 
soon as the latter had done so Katangkatang finished him off by stabbing
 him five times in the back with a bolo.  The intruders then asked for 
more money and ordered Luis Grana's other son, Juan (aged 16), to look 
for more.  Seeing his chance to escape, Juan stood up, jumped out of the
 house and ran away, whereupon the intruders put out the light and left.</p>
  <p>    Both appellants put up an alibi.</p>
  <p>    Denying any participation in the crime, Policarpio Katangkatang
 claimed that he was in his house in barrio Jupit (about 8 kilometers 
from the scene of the crime) on the night in question and on this he was
 corroborated by Fernando Hipe, a school teacher in that barrio, who 
said that he was boarding in the house of this appellant though he had 
his own house and family in another barrio about three kilometers away. 
 The trial court, however, thought it unlikely that this teacher would 
pass the night in question (which was a Saturday) in another man's house
 when his own was not far away.  And anyway it was not at all impossible
 for this appellant to have slipped out of the house and gone to Luis 
Grana's place without his absence being noticed by Hipe, who was busy 
preparing his lesson plan.</p>
  <p>    Gonzalo Hembra on his part also denied having participated in 
the commission of the crime and testified that from 7 to 12 o'clock that
 night he was at a dance in Jaro Elementary School together with a 
friend, Norberto Lompa.  The latter corroborated the testimony.  But as 
the Solicitor General points out, it is surprising that intimate friend 
though he claims to be of this appellant, Lompay does not know whether 
appellant is married or not; and that while Lompay could recall the date
 of the dance he attended with this appellant, he could not remember the
 dates of any of the other dances he attended that same month.</p>
  <p>    Though the defense claims that the robbery part of the charge 
has not been established because of the confusion in the testimony of 
the widow as to the source of the P200 taken by the appellants from the 
deceased, we find that the handing of the money to the malefactors is a 
clearly proven fact, and that the widow's confusion may be attributed to
 her ignorance and lack of schooling if not to a defective memory.  
Moreover, no other motive has been proved or even suggested to account 
for the killing of father and son in their own house that night.</p>
  <p>    The really important question for determination refers to the 
identification of the appellants.</p>
  <p>    Appellants were identified by three witnesses: the widow 
Victoria Cahinde, her son Juan Grana, and their guest Sotera Ca単ezo.  
There is no question that all three were in the house that night and saw
 appellants at close range.  It is true that appellants had their faces 
partly covered.  But then there was light in the house and appellants 
were familiar figures to the three, living as they did not far from them
 and having been known to them for a long time.  In the case of the 
appellant Hembra, there is the further circumstance, admitted by him, 
that he was a former sweetheart of the witness Sotera Ca単ezo.  The 
widow's mistake in pointing to Katangkatang as Hembra and vice-versa may
 indicate that she did not know them by name but does not necessarily 
prove that she did not know them by face.  And in any event, there is 
still the clear and positive testimony of Juan Grana and Sotera Ca単ezo 
respecting the identity of the malefactors even if that of the widow 
should be doubted.  The circumstance that the names of the perpetrators 
of the crime were not immediately revealed to the authorities appears to
 have been due to the survivors' fear of reprisals which made them 
withhold that information until they had moved to the <i>poblacion</i> 
after the burial of the deceased and the end of the customary number of 
days of prayer in their house in the farm.</p>
  <p>    After going over the evidence we find appellants guilty of 
robbery with homicide.  The defense is right in saying that the evidence
 does not show that the crime was perpetrated by a band.  And with the 
exception of nocturnity, we are also with the defense in rejecting the 
aggravating circumstances appreciated by the trial court.  But as 
nocturnity is not compensated by any mitigating circumstance, the 
penalty impossable is still death.  However, there is no sufficient vote
 for the imposition of this penalty so that appellants can only be 
sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua.</i></p>
  <p>    Wherefore, reducing the penalty imposed below from death to <i>reclusion
 perpetua,</i> the judgment appealed from is affirmed in all other 
respects, with costs against the appellants.</p>

Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
