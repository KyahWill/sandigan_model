				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In two separate&nbsp; informations,&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-mentioned defendants were charged before the&nbsp; Manila Court of First Instance with violations of Central&nbsp; Bank Circular No. 31 in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with section&nbsp; 34 of Republic Act No. 265, because&nbsp; as&nbsp; officers of&nbsp; Henderson&nbsp; Trippe&nbsp; (Philippines) Inc., they obtained two&nbsp; excessive allocations&nbsp; of&nbsp; foreign exchange&nbsp; for the purchase of cattle&nbsp; from Australia to the Philippines by falsely representing the price to be $114.20 per head,&nbsp; when as a matter of fact, thew knew the price to be only $66.20 per head,&nbsp; ($43.90 in the other information).<br><br>Through their counsel,&nbsp; defendants moved to quash the informations on&nbsp; several&nbsp; grounds, some of which were:<br><ol><li>That Special&nbsp; Prosecutor Guillermo&nbsp; B. Guevara&nbsp; had no&nbsp; legal authority to sign the informations;<br><br></li><li>That no preliminary investigation had&nbsp; been conducted as&nbsp; to Charles E. Henderson III and Augustus S. Trippe;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></li><li>That the allegedly violated Circular No. 31 was illegal; and ;<br><br></li><li>That&nbsp; assuming the legality of&nbsp; Circular No.&nbsp; 31, the facts described&nbsp; in&nbsp; the informations&nbsp; do&nbsp; not constitute violations&nbsp; thereof.<br></li></ol>After hearing the parties, the judge overruled the first, second and fourth&nbsp; objections, as well&nbsp; as other objections&nbsp; Testing on procedural&nbsp; requirements; but&nbsp; he&nbsp; sustained&nbsp;&nbsp; objection&nbsp; No. 3, declared Circular No. 31 to be illegal,&nbsp; and therefore&nbsp; dismissed the informations. <br><br>Both the People and the defendants appealed, the former maintaining the legality of Circular No. 31, and the latter insisting on its three other&nbsp; objections above-stated.<br><br><i>The People's Appeal.</i>—The trial judge opined that&nbsp; as Circular No. 31 had been avowedly issued by virtue&nbsp; of the powers of the Central Bank&nbsp; and Monetary Board under&nbsp; section 74 of Republic Act 265, it was invalid because it&nbsp; had not been approved (a) by at least five Members of the Monetary&nbsp; Board, and (6)&nbsp; by the President of the Philippines, and because (c) it was not in accordance with the Executive and&nbsp; International Agreements of which the&nbsp; Republic is now a member.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>As to the first ground,&nbsp; the record shows that Circular No. 31 has been approved by the&nbsp; vote of seven members&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Board;&nbsp; and defendants&nbsp; do&nbsp; not&nbsp; now insist on&nbsp; it. <br><br>As to the third ground, it has not been established how the Circular conflicts with other executive or international&nbsp; agreements. On the other hand, the People contends that Circular No. 20 of the Bank had been&nbsp; approved by the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Monetary Fund,&nbsp; and that Circular No.&nbsp; 31&nbsp;&nbsp; constituted merely an implementation thereof.&nbsp; And defendants&nbsp;&nbsp; herein,&nbsp; in their&nbsp; brief&nbsp; as&nbsp; appellees,&nbsp; paid&nbsp; no particular attention to this&nbsp; phase of the controversy. There remains for consideration, the lack of Presidential&nbsp; approval.&nbsp; Fully to understand the issue involved,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; to transcribe section&nbsp; 74&nbsp; of Republic Act 265:<br><blockquote>SEC. 74. Emergency&nbsp; restrictions&nbsp; on exchange operations.— Notwithstanding the provisions of the third paragraph of the preceding section, in order to protect the international reserve of the Central Bank during an exchange crisis and to&nbsp; give the Monetary&nbsp; Board and the Government time in which to take&nbsp; constructive measures to&nbsp; combat such a crisis, the Monetary Board, with concurrence of at&nbsp; least five of its members, and with the approval of the President of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; may&nbsp; temporarily suspend or restrict sales of exchange by the Central Bank and may&nbsp; subject t all transactions in gold&nbsp; and foreign exchange to&nbsp; license by the Central Bank.&nbsp; The adoption of the emergency measures authorized&nbsp; in this section shall be&nbsp; subjects to any executive and international agreements to which the Republic of the Philippines is a party."<br></blockquote>In view of our rapidly&nbsp; declining dollar&nbsp; reserves,&nbsp; the Monetary Board by unanimous vote of all its six members present at its meeting&nbsp; of&nbsp; December&nbsp; 9, 1949,&nbsp; approved Circular No. 20 entitled&nbsp; "Restriction on Gold and Foreign Exchange Transactions".&nbsp; Consisting of&nbsp; nine paragraphs,. its first read as follows:<br><blockquote>"1. Pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act No. 265 (Central Bank Act) the&nbsp; Monetary Board, by unanimous vote&nbsp; and with the approval of the President of&nbsp; the Philippines,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in accordance with Executive and International Agreements to which the Republic of the Philippines is a party, hereby restricts sales of exchange by the Central Bank and subjects&nbsp; all&nbsp; transactions in gold and foreign exchange to licensing.by the Central Bank."<br></blockquote>One of its paragraph provided that no person or company shall purchase foreign exchange directly or indirectly except from or through authorized agents of&nbsp; the Central Bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; And its last paragraph gave&nbsp; notice that "further regulations&nbsp; in&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; transactions&nbsp;&nbsp; covered&nbsp; by&nbsp; this Circular will be&nbsp; issued separately".<br><br>Said Circular No.&nbsp; 20 carried&nbsp; the&nbsp; President's approval. Other circulars&nbsp; were later issued, among them Circular No. 31&nbsp; (December 1951)&nbsp; section 6&nbsp; of&nbsp; which provides:<br><blockquote>"Any&nbsp; person,&nbsp; directly&nbsp; or through his&nbsp; agent or representative, who shall&nbsp; apply with the&nbsp; Central Bank or any of its Authorized Agents for purchase of&nbsp; foreign exchange who shall make material misrepresentations in any application or other papers or documents required in accordance with the exchange control regulations issued&nbsp; by the Central Bank by virtue&nbsp; of which misrepresentations, the Central Bank or any of&nbsp; its Authorized Agents was led to grant him on exchange license&nbsp; for any purpose, shall be guilty&nbsp; of violating&nbsp; this section."<br></blockquote>The People admits that&nbsp; this&nbsp; Circular No. 31 bore no specific&nbsp; sanction of the President of the Philippines.&nbsp; It contends,&nbsp; however, that such approval&nbsp; was unnecessary, because it merely implemented or clarified Circular No. 20 by&nbsp; defining&nbsp; different violations&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Circular,&nbsp; which&nbsp; had the Chief Executive's&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> imprimatur. </span><br><br>This issue may&nbsp; now be considered settled by&nbsp; our&nbsp; recent&nbsp; decision&nbsp; in People vs.&nbsp; Jolliffe<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; wherein the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; of k Central&nbsp; Bank Circular No. 21 was assailed on identical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grounds: lack of Presidential endorsement.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Circular merely&nbsp; implemented&nbsp; Central Bank&nbsp; Circular No.&nbsp; 20, by providing that "any person desiring to export gold in any form, including jewelry *&nbsp; * * must&nbsp; obtain a license from&nbsp; the Central Bank."&nbsp;&nbsp; Prosecuted&nbsp; for exporting gold bullion&nbsp; without license of the Bank,&nbsp; in&nbsp; violation of&nbsp; said Circular No. 21 and section 34 of Republic Act 265, Jolliffe attacked the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; thereof for&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; sanction. Resolving the issue, we held&nbsp; that after the President had&nbsp; approved&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank Circular No. 20, other circulars&nbsp; to&nbsp; implement&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; did not&nbsp; need Presidential&nbsp; approval. Speaking&nbsp; through&nbsp; Mr. Justice Concepcion,&nbsp; we&nbsp; explained that "the original&nbsp; circular subjecting to licensing by the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank"&nbsp; all transactions&nbsp; in gold and foreign exchange",&nbsp; is&nbsp; Circular No.&nbsp; 20, which,&nbsp; as approved and&nbsp; published,&nbsp; stated,&nbsp; that, "pursuant to&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 265",&nbsp; it&nbsp; had&nbsp; been&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; by&nbsp; "the Monetary Board, by unanimous vote and <i>with the approval of the President of the Philippines."</i>&nbsp; What is more, the last paragraph of Circular&nbsp; No. 20, provides&nbsp; that "further&nbsp; regulations in respect to transactions covered by this circular will be issued separately."&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the President had approved not only the "licensing by the&nbsp; Central Bank"&nbsp; of "all transactions in gold and foreign exchange but, also, the issuance, subsequently to the promulgation of Circular No. 20, of "further regulations in respect" of such transactions.&nbsp; Said further regulations were incorporated into Circular No. 21, which thus bears the stamp of presidential sanction, although&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> this is not specifically required by law.</span> It is&nbsp; only the decision of the Monetary Board <span style="font-style: italic;">to subject</span> to license&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Central&nbsp; Bank&nbsp; all transactions&nbsp; in gold and foreign exchange that&nbsp; needs the approval of&nbsp; the President.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the same has been given,&nbsp; the details in the implementation of said decision&nbsp; may be determined by&nbsp; said. Board,&nbsp; through such regulations&nbsp; as may be promulgated from time to time.&nbsp; The assent of the President is not&nbsp; a prerequisite to&nbsp; the&nbsp; validity and&nbsp; effectivity&nbsp; of these regulations,&nbsp; as distinguished&nbsp; from the aforementioned decision thereby sought to&nbsp; be enforced or executed. The authority of the Monetary&nbsp; Board to make regulations is governed, not by&nbsp; section 74 of Republic Act&nbsp; No. 265, but by section 14 thereof * * *."<br><br>Needless to say, Circular No.&nbsp; 31 now in question, stands on&nbsp; the same footing as&nbsp; Circular No. 21.&nbsp; It&nbsp; must&nbsp; be declared valid.&nbsp; .<br><br><i>Defendants' Appeal</i>.— In their first assignment of error, accused-appellants&nbsp; assail&nbsp; the validity of this prosecution because the information had been signed by&nbsp; "Guillermo B. Guevara, Special Prosecutor".<br><br>It appears that Judge Guevara —a practicing attorney&nbsp; — was designated by the President as&nbsp; special investigator of certain alleged&nbsp; anomalies in the Government and&nbsp; in connection therewith, the&nbsp; Secretary&nbsp; of&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; assigned him "to assist the City Fiscal of Manila in the investigation and prosecution of violatons&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Central&nbsp; Bank Act, including violations of circulars and regulations issued&nbsp; by the Monetary&nbsp; Board, Central&nbsp; Bank *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * relative&nbsp; to importation and exchange control".&nbsp;&nbsp; This designation was lawfully done&nbsp; under section 1686 of the&nbsp; Administrative Code, as amended.<br><br>After&nbsp; conducting an&nbsp; investigation of written charges against the officers of&nbsp; Henderson Trippe (Philippines) Inc., Judge Guevara filed the informations against herein defendants, who now question his authority to initiate the proceeding, inasmuch as said investigation and prosecution had been carried out and filed without the consent of the City Fiscal of&nbsp; Manila.<br><br>The question is not new.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have held in People vs. Dinglasan3 that a lawyer appointed by the&nbsp; Secretary of Justice, pursuant to section 1686 of the Revised Administrative Code,&nbsp; as amended,&nbsp;&nbsp; to assist the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Fiscal, is authorized&nbsp; to sign&nbsp; informations, make investigations and&nbsp; conduct prosecutions.&nbsp; This lawyer does not need to secure the consent of the corresponding Fiscal to start a prosecution.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; it is not a secret that&nbsp; the power in&nbsp; said section has often been&nbsp; exercised by the Department&nbsp; of&nbsp; Justice, whenever it did not see eye to eye with the Fiscal&nbsp; on certain&nbsp; matters involving offenses and/or prosecutions.<br><br>Concerning the appellants' contention that Republic Act 1201,&nbsp; section 38-A,&nbsp; has given the City Fiscal of Manila, rather the Prosecution Division&nbsp; of that Office, the <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusive power to investigate and sign informations</span>, we agree&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court's interpretation of&nbsp; said&nbsp; section&nbsp; as&nbsp; merely referring to the internal administrative organization of the office, establishing therein a sort of division&nbsp; of labor for purposes of efficiency. <br><br>In the second assignment&nbsp; of error, defendants Charles E. Henderson&nbsp; III and Augustus S. Trippe, claim a procedural&nbsp; irregularity by&nbsp; asserting&nbsp; that the prosecutor had not given them the benefit of a preliminary investigation.<br><br>We have before&nbsp; us&nbsp; the transcript of the notes&nbsp; of&nbsp; the investigation conducted.&nbsp; Therein the "respondents"&nbsp; named&nbsp; were Alfred Segal and Mr. Helmuth Koenig; but the investigation was&nbsp; really against the corporation Henderson Trippe&nbsp; (Philippines)&nbsp; Inc. as shown&nbsp; by the following heading of such notes:<br><blockquote>"IN THE MATTER OF THE CHARGES FILES) BY THE&nbsp; CENTRAL BANK AGAINST THE HENDERSON TRIPPE (PHILIPPINES) INC. FOR VIOLATION OF THE REGULATIONS OF THE MONETARY BOARD AND IN RESPONSE TO THE SUBPOENA ISSUED BY JUDGE GUILLERMO B. GUEVARA, DATED JANUARY 23, 1956&nbsp; MESSRS. ALFRED SEGAL&nbsp; AND HELMUTH KOENIG APPEARED PERSONALLY THIS&nbsp; MORNING,&nbsp; JANUARY 25,&nbsp; 1956, AT 10:00&nbsp; SHARP"<br></blockquote>And&nbsp; the written charges specifically mentioned&nbsp; said officers&nbsp; along with&nbsp; others.<br><br>In fact, Attorney Lobrin,&nbsp; who appeared for the above "respondents" <i>also appeared for the officers of the corporation,</i> (including naturally, Henderson III&nbsp; and Trippe, who were&nbsp; admittedly President and&nbsp; Director, respectively, of the corporation&nbsp; under&nbsp; probe.<br><br>Moreover, the statute concerning preliminary investigations merely&nbsp; requires&nbsp; that the&nbsp; accused shall be given a chance to be heard&nbsp; where such accused can be subpoenaed and appears before&nbsp; the investigating fiscal, with the right to cross-examine the complainant and his witnesses.&nbsp; From the notes, one could gather that during the investigation, Judge Guevara told Mr. Segal and Atty. Lobrin to convey to Henderson III the information that&nbsp; he "would welcome his presence here if he deems it wise for the&nbsp; protection of his interests to do so".&nbsp; And in fact, Henderson appeared and witnessed the investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was, in our opinion, sufficient compliance with the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not ask nor was he denied the right to cross-examine.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to Augustus Trippe,&nbsp; it seems he was abroad, and it&nbsp; was unnecessary to give him a chance, because he could&nbsp; not be subpoenaed. At any&nbsp; rate, his interests were&nbsp;&nbsp; represented by the Attorney&nbsp; representing the corporate&nbsp; officers.<br><br>We find&nbsp; no mistake on this score.<br><br>In their&nbsp; last assignment, defendants claim that, admitting the validity of&nbsp; Circular No. 31, the informations on file do not describe any criminal offense.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of this assignment, one of the informations must be copied below:&nbsp; (except&nbsp; for&nbsp; the figures,&nbsp; the other&nbsp; is the same).<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"INFORMATION"<br></div><br>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *"<br><br>"That&nbsp; on&nbsp; or about June&nbsp; 8, 1954, and&nbsp; for some time prior and subsequent thereto, in the City of Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable&nbsp; Court, the said defendants, being then and there the President, Vice-President&nbsp; and General Manager, and Director, respectively,&nbsp; of&nbsp; a domestic corporation&nbsp; known as the Henderson Trippe&nbsp; (Philippines), Inc. conspiring&nbsp; together&nbsp; confederating with each other, and through the use of false&nbsp; pretenses and gross misrepresentations, did then and&nbsp; there&nbsp; opened, or caused to&nbsp; be opened, Letter of Credit No.&nbsp; 61329&nbsp; through the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank, one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; agent&nbsp; banks of&nbsp; the Central Bank,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum . of $91,360,&nbsp; U,&nbsp; S.&nbsp; dollars,&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; Henderson&nbsp; Trippe Shipping (Australia),&nbsp; Pty.,&nbsp; Ltd., represented by the defendant Augustus's. Trippe.&nbsp; in&nbsp; Australia&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; beneficiary, on the&nbsp; strength of&nbsp; a representation made to the said agent bank, the Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the letter&nbsp; of credit&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; used&nbsp; to finance the purchase of 800 heads&nbsp; of cattle in Australia, at the agreed price of $114.20 F. O. B.,&nbsp; per head,&nbsp; including feed&nbsp; and fodder, as per "firm offer"&nbsp; which the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; accompanied or&nbsp; caused&nbsp; to be accompanied&nbsp; to the application for the Letter of Credit, when in fact and in truth, as the defendants well knew, the real cost F. O. B. per head of the cattle,&nbsp; including feed&nbsp; and fodder was $66.20 only; that in pursuance to the plan of the defendants to withdraw more foreign&nbsp; exchange than&nbsp; legally and&nbsp; actually&nbsp; necessary, defendant Augustus S.&nbsp; Trippe for and on behalf of a dummy entity under the style of Henderson-Trippe Shipping&nbsp; (Australia)&nbsp; Pty., Ltd., posed himself as&nbsp; shipper&nbsp; of the cattle and withdrew from and/or negotiated the Letter&nbsp; of Credit 61329&nbsp; in the&nbsp; sum of $74,226.76 for 578 heads, that&nbsp; is, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; basis of $128.42&nbsp; per head, instead&nbsp; of $38,263.60 or&nbsp; $66.20 per&nbsp; head, thereby defrauding the dollar reserve of the country in&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of $35,963.16."<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; alleges violation of Circular No. 31, particularly of section&nbsp; 6, herein-before quoted.<br><br>It seems quite clear from the information&nbsp; above transcribed that the defendants as officers of Henderson Trippe (Philippines) Inc. applied for — and got — foreign exchange (91,360 U. S. dollars) for the purchase&nbsp; of cattle&nbsp; in&nbsp; Australia, and in so doing, they made the material misrepresentation&nbsp; that&nbsp; such&nbsp; head&nbsp; of cattle&nbsp; would&nbsp; cost $114.20, whereas they knew that&nbsp; it would cost $66.20&nbsp; only.&nbsp; No better description can be made of a violation of the above provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 6, Circular&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 31.&nbsp;&nbsp; And section 34 of Republic Act 265 provides the penalty for such violation.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; overruling the defendants' assignments of error, and sustaining the&nbsp; appeal of the prosecution, we hereby direct the&nbsp; return&nbsp; of the&nbsp; expediente&nbsp; to the court below&nbsp; for further proceedings&nbsp;&nbsp; in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; this opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp; ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Reyes, A., J.,</i> concurs&nbsp; in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Or not shown to accord with.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, p. 677.</div>
