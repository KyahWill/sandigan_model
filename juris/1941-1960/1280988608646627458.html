				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of 
Iloilo which directs the defendant to give to the minor children, 
Reynaldo Carissimo and Maria Sylvia, a monthly allowance of P200 by way 
of alimony <i>pendente lite</i> from November 6, 1950 until the 
principal case has been finally decided.
  <p>    This appeal was originally taken to the Court of Appeals but 
was later certified to this Court because it only involves questions of 
law.</p>
  <p>    On November 2, 1950, Rosita Suelo Salazar, plaintiff, filed an 
action in the Court of First Instance of Iloilo praying that Ignacio 
Salazar, defendant, be ordered to pay her a monthly allowance of P300 as
 alimony <i>pendente lite,</i> and that, after trial, said monthly 
allowance be made permanent.</p>
  <p>    Plaintiff avers that she is the lawful wife of defendant, they 
having been married on July 24, 1947 before the Municipal Court of 
Manila, and, later, they repeated the ceremony before the parish priest 
of Espiritu Santo Catholic Church on July 28, 1947; that out of the 
marital relation, two children were born, namely, Reynaldo Carissimo, 2 
years and 5 months of age and Maria Sylvia, 11 months of age; that on 
August 9, 1950, defendant abandoned the conjugal home and refused to 
give support and maintenance to plaintiff and the children; that 
defendant is receiving a monthly salary of P600 from the Negros 
Navigation Company, Iloilo City, and another monthly salary of P550 from
 the Southern Lines Inc., also of Iloilo City, while plaintiff is 
without any source of income.  Copies of the marriage certificates were 
attached to the complaint.</p>
  <p>    Defendant, in his answer, admitted the celebration of the 
marriage alleged in the complaint, but averred that they were sham and 
fictitious and were merely celebrated for reasons of convenience and to 
avoid scandal, the plaintiff and defendant being at the time already 
legally married, the plaintiff to one Ramon Perez and defendant to Maria
 Olea Salazar, and therefore, said marriages are null and void and of no
 legal effect.  Defendant also admitted having had illicit relations 
with the plaintiff and that out of said illicit relations, the children 
mentioned in the complaint were born.  Defendant claims that he had an 
arrangement with plaintiff to end their illicit relations and place the 
children under his custody but that plaintiff ignored this arrangement. 
 Defendant further claims that he is still willing and ready to have the
 two children under his custody and to support them in his home.</p>
  <p>    On December 6, 1950, plaintiff filed an <i>ex parte</i> motion 
praying that her petition for alimony <i>pendente lite</i> be set for 
hearing, and accordingly it was set for hearing on December 9, 1950.  On
 the latter date, the motion was argued orally by counsel of both 
parties, who supplemented their oral arguments with written memoranda.  
Thereafter, on January 26, 1951, the court issued an order awarding the 
two minor children a monthly allowance of P200 as stated in the early 
part of this decision.</p>
  <p>    His motion to set aside the order having been denied, defendant
 took steps to take the case on appeal to this Court.  The case however,
 through inadvertence, was forwarded to the Court of Appeals.  In due 
time, defendant paid the docketing fees and the cost of printing the 
record on appeal which amounted to P174.75, and said record on appeal 
was duly printed in accordance with the rules.  Thereafter, or on 
December 28, 1951, appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the 
ground that the order appealed from is not appealable because it is 
merely interlocutory in nature.  On January 7, 1952, appellant submitted
 his written opposition to said motion.  The case was later certified to
 this Court on the ground that it was inadvertently forwarded to the 
Court of Appeals and it merely involves a question of law, but no action
 has been taken on the motion to dismiss.</p>
  <p>    The motion to dismiss filed by appellee during the pendency of 
this appeal on the ground that the order appealed from is not appealable
 because it is merely interlocutory, cannot be entertained.  While an 
order denying or granting alimony <i>pendente lite</i> is interlocutory 
and consequently non-appealable (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 
Vol. II, 1952 ed., page 120), however, if appeal is taken therefrom, and
 no timely objection is interposed thereto, the objection is deemed 
waived.  Thus, when the objection is founded on the ground that the 
judgment appealed from is interlocutory, but the appellee, before making
 such objection, has allowed the record on appeal to be approved and 
printed, and has allowed the appellant to print his brief, such 
objection is too late and is deemed waived (Slade-Perkins <i>v.</i> 
Perkings, 57 Phil. 223, 225; Luenvo &amp; Martinez <i>v.</i> Herrero, 17
 Phil. 29; Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. I, 1952 ed., p. 
987).  The motion to dismiss should therefore be denied.</p>
  <p>    In his first assignment of error, appellant questions the 
procedure followed by the court <i>a quo</i> in the determination of the
 alimony <i>pendente lite.</i> He claims that the court did not follow 
the procedure prescribed in Section 5, Rule 63, which, according to him,
 enjoins the court to determine provisionally the pertinent facts of the
 case, having due regard to the necessities of the applicant, the means 
of the adverse party, and such other circumstances as may aid in the 
proper eludication of the question involved.</p>
  <p>    We find that the court has substantially complied with the 
prescribed rule on the matter.  The rule requires that the court shall 
determine provisionally the pertinent facts in the same manner as is 
provided in connection with motions (Section 4).  This means that to 
determine the pertinent facts there is no need of receiving oral 
testimony.  It is enough that those facts be established by affidavits 
or other documentary evidence appearing in the record.  In the instant 
case, the court has relied on the main allegations of the complaint 
which is verified and supported by documentary evidence.  On the other 
hand, the main facts were not disputed especially those which refer to 
the illicit relations between plaintiff and defendant and the monthly 
earnings of the latter.  Moreover, the court set the incident for 
hearing and the parties, as well as their counsel, were given enough 
opportunity to be heard.</p>
  <p>    But there is one reason which weakens the claim that the lower 
court did not weigh the defense that the marriages which plaintiff 
alleges to have been celebrated between her and the defendant were but 
sham and fictitious and were celebrated merely for reasons of 
convenience.    We refer to the fact that the alimony <i>pendente lite</i>
 was granted by the court not to the plaintiff but to the two children 
born out of their illicit relations.  The right of these children to 
support exists regardless of marriage under the present law.  These 
children are entitled not only to support but also to inherit.  (Art. 
287, New Civil Code).</p>
  <p>    As regards the contention that the court fixed the monthly 
allowance of P200 without considering the necessities of the applicant, 
or the means of the adverse party, as required by the rules, the same is
 likewise untenable, for it appears from the complaint, and this is not 
disputed, that appellant has a monthly income of P1,150.  This is a 
sufficient basis in determining the amount of alimony <i>pendente lite</i>
 until the contrary is shown when the case is decided on the merits.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, without costs.</p>
