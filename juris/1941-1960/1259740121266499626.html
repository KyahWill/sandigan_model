				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila.<br><br>The appellant&nbsp; was&nbsp; charged, in the&nbsp; court below with&nbsp; a violation of article&nbsp; 195, Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; committed, according to the&nbsp; information, as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on .or&nbsp; about&nbsp; November 7, 1954,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the, City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, Philippines, the&nbsp; said accused, being&nbsp; then a jueteng collector of the <i>Jueteng</i> Den known as.&nbsp; 'Peping'&nbsp; and 'Bago', did then and&nbsp; there willfully,&nbsp; unlawfully and&nbsp; feloniously&nbsp; have&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; possession and custody the following:&nbsp; cash money in the amount of P7.90, one (1) Eberhand Faber 'Mongol' pencil and two&nbsp; (2) pieces of jueteng lists,&nbsp; which have been used&nbsp; or intended to be&nbsp; used. in a game of chance and hazard commonly known as Jueteng&nbsp; in which money and other things&nbsp; of value&nbsp; are played for, in said City."<br></blockquote>Pleading guilty to&nbsp; the charge, he&nbsp; was&nbsp; sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of&nbsp; from 6 months anH^l&nbsp; day&nbsp; of <i>prision correctional,</i> as minimum, to 2 years, 4 months and 1 day of <i>prision correctional,</i> as maximum, and to pay the costs.<br><br>It&nbsp; would&nbsp; appear that&nbsp; appellant was&nbsp; sentenced under subdivision (c)&nbsp; of article&nbsp; 195 of the Revised Penal Code, which prescribes&nbsp; a&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; of&nbsp; <i>prision correctional</i> in its medium degree for illegal possession of lottery lists and , other&nbsp; articles used&nbsp; in the game of jueteng.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant's counsel now contends that this was error and&nbsp; that appellants&nbsp; should&nbsp; have&nbsp; been sentenced only&nbsp; to&nbsp; a&nbsp; fine under subdivision (<i>a</i>) of&nbsp; the same article.<br><br>The contention is&nbsp; without merit.&nbsp; The article in question reads:<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 195. <i>What&nbsp; acts&nbsp; are&nbsp; punishable&nbsp; in&nbsp; gambling.â€”</i> (<i>a</i>) . The penalty of <i>arresto menor</i> or a fine of not exceeding two hundred pesos, and, in case of&nbsp; recidivism, the penalty of&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor </span>or a fine . ranging from two hundred to&nbsp; six thousand pesos,&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; upon;<br><br>"1. Any person other than those referred to in subsections&nbsp; (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>)&nbsp; who, in any manner, shall .directly&nbsp; or indirectly&nbsp; take&nbsp; part&nbsp; in any game of <i>monte, jueteng, </i>or any other form of lottery, policy, .banking or percentage game,&nbsp; dog&nbsp; races,&nbsp; or any other games&nbsp; or scheme the result of which depends&nbsp; wholly or chiefly upon chance or hazard; or wherein wagers consisting of money, articles of value, or representative of value are made;&nbsp; or in the&nbsp; exploitation or use of any other mechanical invention or contrivance to&nbsp; determine by chance the loser or winner of money or any object or representative of value."<br><br>"2. Any&nbsp; person who shall knowingly permit any form of gambling referred to in&nbsp; the preceding subdivision&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; carried&nbsp; on in&nbsp; any inhabited or uninhabited place&nbsp; or&nbsp; any building,&nbsp; vessel, or other means of transportation owned or controlled by him. If the place where gambling is carried on has the reputation of a gambling place or that&nbsp; prohibited gambling&nbsp; is&nbsp; frequently carried on therein,&nbsp; the culprit shall be punished by the penalty provided for in&nbsp; the article in its maximum period.<br><br>"(<i>b</i>) The penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision&nbsp; correctional</span> in its maximum degree shall be imposed&nbsp; upon the maintainer, conductor,&nbsp; or banker in a game of<span style="font-style: italic;"> jueteng</span>&nbsp; or&nbsp; any similar game.<br><br>"(<i>c</i>) The penalty of&nbsp; <i>prision correctional</i> in its medium degree shall be imposed upon any&nbsp; person who shall, knowingly and&nbsp; without lawful purpose, have&nbsp; in his possession&nbsp; any lottery list,&nbsp; paper,&nbsp; or other matter containing 1 letters,&nbsp; figures, signs,&nbsp; or&nbsp; symbols&nbsp; which pertain to or are in any manner used in the game of <i>jueteng</i>&nbsp; or any similar game which has&nbsp; taken place&nbsp; or about to&nbsp; take place,"</blockquote>It is clear that a person would&nbsp; come under subdivision&nbsp; (<i>a</i>) of&nbsp; this article&nbsp; only if&nbsp; he&nbsp; did not come either under subdivision&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; or subdivision&nbsp; (<i>c</i>).&nbsp; But in the case before us, the accused comes under subdivision (<i>c</i>)&nbsp; because&nbsp; the information&nbsp; to which he pleaded guilty charges&nbsp; him with unlawful possession of, among&nbsp; other things, <i> jueteng</i> lists used or intended to be used in a game of chance, commonly known as<span style="font-style: italic;"> jueteng.</span>&nbsp; The&nbsp; information,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; true,&nbsp; alleges that he is a&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">jueteng</span> collector.&nbsp; But this&nbsp; allegation is&nbsp; obviously&nbsp; made&nbsp; for the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; showing&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; had possession of the&nbsp; article&nbsp; mentioned "knowingly and without lawful purpose" and&nbsp; should&nbsp; not be construed in&nbsp; the sense that he took part in&nbsp; the&nbsp; game of<span style="font-style: italic;"> jueteng</span> other than as maintainer, conductor or&nbsp; banker under subdivision&nbsp; (<i>b</i>) or illegal possessor of any lottery list under subdivision&nbsp; (<i>c</i>)'.<br><br>The judgment below being in accordance with law, the same is hereby affirmed with costs against the appellant.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
