				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff has appealed to this Court from the decision of the Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rizal&nbsp; dismissing his complaint for support on the ground that hid own evidence failed to establish his right thereto, inasmuch as he did not show he was one of the children entitled to support from their&nbsp; parents namely,&nbsp; (1) legitimate children;&nbsp; (2) acknowledged natural children;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; natural&nbsp; children&nbsp; by legal fictions; (4) illegitimate children who are not natural.<br><br>In his&nbsp; notice of&nbsp; appeal, plaintiff announced the intention to bring the matter to&nbsp; this Court to&nbsp; raise questions of law only.&nbsp; And in the printed brief filed here, he contended that under the facts found by the trial judge, he was entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; support, as&nbsp; an illegitimate&nbsp; child&nbsp; who is&nbsp; not natural.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendant meets the points&nbsp; raised; and&nbsp; in addition&nbsp; discusses&nbsp; the&nbsp; vital&nbsp; question&nbsp; of&nbsp; paternity.&nbsp;&nbsp; He claims, and quotes from the testimonial evidence, that plaintiff ; <span style="font-style: italic;">is not his</span> son, or has failed to establish filiation. <br><br>This appeal&nbsp; involves, therefore, issues of fact, and does not belong here, the amount in controversy being less than P50.000<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * when a&nbsp; case is&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; directly to the Supreme&nbsp; Court for the reason that appellant is raising only a question of law, but appellee in his brief raises questions of fact disputing the findings of the&nbsp; trial Court, the appeal should be referred to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; An appellee who obtains a favorable&nbsp; judgment is&nbsp; not called upon to appeal and attack a decision that favors him; neither is he in a position to&nbsp; decide which Court he wants the appeal of the appellant&nbsp; to&nbsp; go&nbsp; to, until the (appellee)&nbsp; has read the brief of said&nbsp; appellant and, appraised himself of&nbsp; the&nbsp; issues&nbsp; raised,&nbsp; the arguments addressed, and the chances of having the appealed decision&nbsp; reversed or modified on those issues&nbsp; and arguments&nbsp; alone. Consequently,&nbsp; after reading the appellant's brief, appellee may raise issues of fact in his brief to maintain the judgment on other grounds without the necessity, in such case, of&nbsp; appealing.&nbsp; And if appellee, under such circumstances, does raise questions of fact in his brief, it is proper to certify the whole&nbsp; case to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals." (Moran, Rules of Court&nbsp; [1957&nbsp; Ed.] Vol.&nbsp; I, p. 674&nbsp; citing&nbsp; Justo, et al.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Hernando, 89 Phil., 268; Saenz <i>vs.</i> Mitchell, 60&nbsp; Phil., 60, 80; Villovert&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Lim,&nbsp; 62 Phil., 178 etc.;&nbsp; Relativo vs Castro, 76 Phil.,&nbsp; 563.)<br></blockquote>Accordingly, the record&nbsp; should&nbsp; be referred, as&nbsp; it&nbsp; is hereby referred, to the Court of Appeals for adjudication.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angela, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia,</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
