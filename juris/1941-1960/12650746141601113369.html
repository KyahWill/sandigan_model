				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Plaintiff brought this action originally in the Municipal Court of Manila to&nbsp; recover from&nbsp; defendant the sum of P11,446 as unpaid balance of his compensation for the loss of sight of his eyes,&nbsp; under the Workmen's Compensation Law.&nbsp; The municipal court dismissed the case, and on appeal, the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila likewise dismissed&nbsp; it.<br><br>Briefly stated, the undisputed facts clearly&nbsp; shown by the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; on&nbsp; record are as follows:<br><blockquote>Plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; was&nbsp; an&nbsp; employee of defendant-appellee Co Cho Chit at the latter's shop named Grace Park Engineering,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp; On&nbsp; May&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1948, at&nbsp; about&nbsp; eleven o'clock&nbsp; in&nbsp; the morning, while plaintiff was sharpening an auger on&nbsp; the&nbsp; grinding machine&nbsp; in&nbsp; defendant's shop, a flying piece of metal pierced his right eye.&nbsp; He reported the&nbsp; matter immediately to Manuel&nbsp; Castro, his foreman, and&nbsp; upon&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; instructions,&nbsp; he was sent&nbsp; to the Chinese General&nbsp; Hospital.&nbsp; There he was operated on by Dr.&nbsp; Amando&nbsp; V.&nbsp; Santos, who extracted the foreign&nbsp; body at the&nbsp; cornea.&nbsp; After&nbsp; iridectomy,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was found that the lens&nbsp; was&nbsp; completely opaque, thus the injury resulted in the&nbsp; total loss of vision of his right eye.&nbsp; He stayed nine days in the hospital, and&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; paid for the hospital and doctor's bills, as well as his wages during his confinement.&nbsp; Immediately&nbsp; after&nbsp; his&nbsp; operation, plaintiff began feeling pains on his left eye.&nbsp; After his discharge&nbsp; from the&nbsp; hospital,&nbsp; he went&nbsp; to inform defendant&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was willing to work but&nbsp; cannot do so in view&nbsp; of his continued vomiting and dizziness and the condition of his aching left eye which&nbsp; was bothering him;&nbsp; so&nbsp; he was&nbsp; informed that he should&nbsp; not&nbsp; resume his work as the company had&nbsp; no funds&nbsp; to pay to idle workers.</blockquote>On June 14,&nbsp; 1948, plaintiff went to the Bureau of Labor for help and was accordingly examined by&nbsp; Drs.&nbsp; Teofilo V. Gonzales and Jose S. Santillan of the Medical Division who found that there was—<br><blockquote><ol><li> Total blindness of the&nbsp; right eye. <br></li><li> Right pupil&nbsp; is widely dilated and&nbsp; cannot react to light. <br></li><li> Presence of&nbsp; an irregular opacity as big&nbsp; as a seed of maize.<br></li><li> Pain on the right eye&nbsp; (injured)&nbsp; and&nbsp; also&nbsp; in&nbsp; the left&nbsp; eye (normal)."</li></ol></blockquote>This finding is embodied in&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; J.&nbsp; Appellant was then given a blank No. 77-B form to be filled up by his attending physician&nbsp; at the Chinese General Hospital (Exhibit I).&nbsp; This&nbsp; form was duly accomplished by Dr. Amando V. Santos&nbsp; of the hospital on June&nbsp; 15, 1948, wherein said doctor certified that "a small foreign body was found at the cornea; detachment of 1/3 of iris above with opacity of the&nbsp; lens of the right eye,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that after four days' observation he&nbsp; found that the optic nerve was atrophied, and therefore the extraction of the cataract was&nbsp; no longer advisable."&nbsp; On June 17th,&nbsp; upon appellant's return to the Bureau, he was again examined and his left eye was subjected&nbsp; to the Snellen's test as he was already complaining of dimness of&nbsp; sight on&nbsp; that eye.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; also told to report again should any&nbsp; untoward symptoms develop&nbsp; on his left eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; On September'&nbsp; 20th, he returned&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Bureau and&nbsp; Dr. Alfredo A.&nbsp; Gorospe, medical&nbsp; officer&nbsp; in charge of eye injury cases,&nbsp; examined him and found that there was "light perception" of his&nbsp; left&nbsp; eye&nbsp; (Exhibit F-1). On November 22nd, he was again examined by Dr. Gorospe (Exhibit&nbsp; E)&nbsp; and was given&nbsp; a letter&nbsp; addressed&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Director of the&nbsp; San&nbsp; Lazaro Hospital&nbsp; (Exhibit D)&nbsp;&nbsp; requesting examination of&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; blood for Kahn's test to determine syphilitic&nbsp; infection.&nbsp; On that same day, appellant&nbsp; accomplished the printed form&nbsp; of notice of injury and claim for compensation (Exhibit A-1)&nbsp; which he just thumb-marked as he could no&nbsp; longer see with his left eye.<br><br>On December 13th he saw Mrs. Baens-Del Rosario, then Head&nbsp; of&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; of the Bureau of Labor,&nbsp; about his case,&nbsp; and was&nbsp; referred to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Medical Division&nbsp; for opinion (Exhibit G).&nbsp; On the same day,&nbsp; he was&nbsp; finally examined by Dr. Gorospe who found that the loss of sight of the left eye was due to sympathetic ophthalmia (Exhibit F), meaning that "the infection was transferred from&nbsp; the injured eye&nbsp; by way&nbsp; of the optic&nbsp; nerve or optigism&nbsp; of the blood stream"&nbsp; (17 t.s.n.).&nbsp; And he arrived&nbsp; at this conclusion in view of the absence of syphilitic infection as shown by the negative Kahn's test.&nbsp; Hence, on December&nbsp; 16th, the&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Medical Inspection&nbsp; Division returned the papers to Mrs. Baens-Del&nbsp; Rosario thru&nbsp; the Director of&nbsp; Labor, for&nbsp; action&nbsp; (Exhibit H).<br><br>In&nbsp; the meanwhile, however,&nbsp; or as early&nbsp; as July,&nbsp; 1948, defendant made overtures to settle the case amicably and caused his lawyers, thru Atty. Alberto E. Galban, to prepare&nbsp; a written agreement&nbsp; whereby, for a consideration of the sum&nbsp; of P1,402.47, appellant would&nbsp; agree&nbsp; to&nbsp; settle the matter and waive his right&nbsp; to any further compensation arising out&nbsp; of the&nbsp; accident.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; document, Exhibit X, was brought to&nbsp; Mrs. Baens-Del Rosario&nbsp; by Atty. Galban, and a check for the same amount was deposited with&nbsp; the Bureau on July 12, 1948, as shown by official receipt No. A-769621 Exhibit "8".&nbsp; When appellant saw Mrs. Baens-Del Rosario&nbsp; on July 14th, the check was&nbsp; shown&nbsp; to him and&nbsp; was told by her&nbsp; to&nbsp; sign&nbsp; the&nbsp; document&nbsp; "as an&nbsp; ac- knowledgement of the receipt of the check for the sum of P1,402.47&nbsp; in compensation for the loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; the vision of the right eye" (17&nbsp; t.s.n.).&nbsp; Upon his reluctance to do so by reason of the fact that he was feeling pains in his left eye,&nbsp; he was&nbsp; assured by&nbsp; her "that&nbsp; this&nbsp; amount was not in payment&nbsp; for his left eye but for his right eye" (19 t.s.n.).&nbsp; Belying on&nbsp; this assurance, he signed the document as payment for his&nbsp; right eye (20 t.s.n.).&nbsp; We have, there- fore, that while the claim for the left eye was&nbsp; being processed and studied by the Bureau of Labor, there existed already a written agreement (Exh. X)&nbsp; signed on July 14, 1948.&nbsp;&nbsp; This document was not&nbsp; however notarized&nbsp; on that date but on March 2, 1949,&nbsp; a delay&nbsp; not explained in the record.<br><br>The municipal court, in dismissing the case, relied mainly on the release agreement,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; X,&nbsp; and on the alleged absence of statutory&nbsp; provision authorizing compensation for&nbsp; aggravated injury.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; the court&nbsp; of first instance dismissed the same quite&nbsp; on the&nbsp; same grounds, and on the finding that Dr. Gorospe&nbsp; who testified&nbsp; for the plaintiff, was&nbsp; not an&nbsp; eye specialist&nbsp; and therefore "his conclusion that the blindness of the left&nbsp; eye was due&nbsp; to sympathetic ophthalmia&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; be given&nbsp; due weight and consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; appealed&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; this Court&nbsp; contending that the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court erred—<br><blockquote><ol><li> In not considering' the&nbsp; educational qualifications, training and experience of Dr. Alfredo Gorospe as sufficient background to testify as an expert; <br></li><li> In not&nbsp; declaring that the loss&nbsp; of vision&nbsp; of plaintiff's left eye was&nbsp; due to&nbsp; transferred&nbsp; infection&nbsp; (sympathetic ophthalmia)&nbsp; from the injured eye&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; normal&nbsp; eye, and as&nbsp; such, is compensable under the provisions of the "Workmen's Compensation Act No.&nbsp; 3-128, as amended; <br></li><li> In&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that the release agreement&nbsp; marked&nbsp; Exhibit "X" operates to&nbsp; exempt&nbsp; the defendant from any future liability which may&nbsp; arise from&nbsp; the same injury,&nbsp; and consequently shall constitute a bar to any claim for&nbsp; additional&nbsp; compensation; and <br></li><li> In not sentencing the defendant to pay&nbsp; plaintiff the sum of one thousand four hundred forty six pesos (P1,446) with legal interest from the filing'&nbsp; of the complaint, with costs&nbsp; of&nbsp; the suit.''</li></ol></blockquote>Carefully considered, the&nbsp; questions are reduced to&nbsp; the following propositions:&nbsp; first, whether defendant is liable for the loss of sight of plaintiff's left eye which, according" to the&nbsp; latter's&nbsp; contention, originated&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; injury he suffered on his right eye; and second,&nbsp; whether plaintiff is entitled&nbsp; to compensation for the loss of sight of&nbsp; his left eye notwithstanding that the parties&nbsp; had already entered into an amicable&nbsp; settlement as shown by the so-called release agreement of July 14, 1948,&nbsp; which was ratified on<br><br>March 2, 1949, the concluding paragraph of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"NOW, THEREFORE, for&nbsp; and&nbsp; in consideration of&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of ONE THOUSAND&nbsp; FOUR HUNDRED TWO&nbsp; PESOS AND&nbsp; FORTY-SEYEN CENTAVOS (P1,402.47) paid by&nbsp; the EMPLOYER&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; EMPLOYEE, receipt of which sum is&nbsp; hereby acknowledged by&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter to his entire satisfaction, the EMPLOYEE docs hereby freely and voluntarily and without force and intimidation release completely and forever what- ever&nbsp; claim or claims for&nbsp; compensation the EMPLOYEE has or might have&nbsp; in the premises; and docs further waive any and all claims for compensation or benefit for any cause arising directly or&nbsp; indirectly from&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-mentioned accident."</blockquote>There is&nbsp; no&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; the relation between plaintiff and defendant as&nbsp; employee and employer, nor that on May 27, 1948, plaintiff's right eye was&nbsp; injured&nbsp; and as a consequence thereof its vision was lost despite medical attendance.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp; defendant admitted his liability for the loss of sight of plaintiff's right eye when he paid the sum of P1,402.47.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the testimony of Dr. Gorospe, in nowise&nbsp; refuted or&nbsp; contradicted by any evidence&nbsp; on the part of defendant, it has&nbsp; been established that&nbsp; the&nbsp; loss of vision of the left eye was due to transferred infection from the&nbsp; right eye to the&nbsp; left eye&nbsp; or&nbsp; to what&nbsp; he calls "sympathetic ophthalmia."&nbsp; Dr. Gorospe testified that&nbsp; "there was&nbsp; practically no&nbsp; injury on the left&nbsp; eye&nbsp; but there was traumatism on the right eye which, according to authorities, had penetrated the dangerous part of&nbsp; the other eye, which, in few cases I would say,&nbsp; may result to that,&nbsp; and that in the absence of syphilis as determined by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Kahn's test&nbsp; of the examination and also&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence of other diseases, we&nbsp; came to the conclusion&nbsp; that the infection was transferred from&nbsp; the&nbsp; injured eye&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; uninjured&nbsp; eye by way of the optic nerve&nbsp; or optigism of the blood stream." (17&nbsp; t.s.n.).&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked by the lower court&nbsp; about the meaning&nbsp; of&nbsp; sympathetic&nbsp; ophthalmia,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Gorospe&nbsp; explained—"That means a&nbsp; pathologenie agent or probably a filtrable virus has come to the first&nbsp; eye&nbsp; or the exciting eye through the wound and after its development it reaches the second&nbsp; eye or sympathizing eye&nbsp; through the optic nerve or optic chiasm of the blood vessel or blood stream" (39 t.s.n.).&nbsp; This conclusion, however, is&nbsp; assailed by defendant on the grounds that Dr. Gorospe is not sufficiently qualified or competent to testify on the cause of the loss of vision of plaintiff's left eye, the doctor not&nbsp; being&nbsp; a specialist on eye&nbsp; diseases; that his equipment in his clinic is direly&nbsp; deficient; that his knowledge on the particular subject is likewise deficient, for he does not know how to define&nbsp; "aqueous flare" nor the causes of "aqueous flare"; neither could he define a&nbsp; "photopic"&nbsp; or "scotopic&nbsp; eye" nor has he read Adler's "Text&nbsp; Book&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ophthalmology" which is the textbook used on this subject in the University of the Philippines; that Dr. Gorospe&nbsp; has examined and diagnosed only about 48 eye cases in the Bureau of Labor and there was not one of them that he&nbsp; did not recommend for compensation.&nbsp; It appears&nbsp; of record, however,&nbsp; that Dr. Gorospe became a physician in 1926 and&nbsp; had a private practice in&nbsp; Ilocos Sur for&nbsp; one&nbsp; year; from&nbsp; 1927 to&nbsp; 1944 he was the Preaident of the&nbsp; Sanitary&nbsp; Division in Cagayan; in 1946 he joined the Bureau of Labor and up to&nbsp; the time of the&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; of this case,&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; eye&nbsp; injury cases coming to the&nbsp; Bureau were assigned to him,&nbsp; and during that period&nbsp; he&nbsp; has&nbsp; had&nbsp; occasions to&nbsp; treat traumatic and non-traumatic&nbsp; eye diseases, some&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; required surgical&nbsp; operation, such as glaucoma, cataract, pthisis bulbis, iridocylitis, optic&nbsp; atrophy, sympathetic&nbsp; ophthalmia, herpes,&nbsp; zooster, ophthalmitis; he has also&nbsp; read the works of Drs. Ubaldo and Yambao on&nbsp; eye injuries, the work of Dr. Geminiano de Ocampo&nbsp; on cataract and glaucoma as well as the&nbsp; works of these&nbsp; specialists on Iris in Ophthalmology, and Godar's&nbsp; Ophthalmology.&nbsp; Accordingly, we hold that Dr. Gorospe, by&nbsp; his professional&nbsp; training and practical&nbsp; experience,&nbsp; is&nbsp; fully qualified to testify on&nbsp; the cause of the loss of vision of plaintiff's left&nbsp; eye which&nbsp; he personally observed&nbsp; and&nbsp; examined&nbsp; on&nbsp; several&nbsp; occasions before reaching his conclusion on the&nbsp; matter.&nbsp; Moreover we find&nbsp; that&nbsp; Dr. Gorospe's opinion is not contradicted by any expert testimony of a&nbsp; specialist on eye&nbsp; diseases, thus&nbsp; such opinion remains&nbsp; in&nbsp; all force and&nbsp; effect.<br><br>Anent the second question as to whether defendant should be held liable&nbsp; for compensation for the loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; sight&nbsp; of plaintiff's left eye, he having already settled and paid for the latter's&nbsp; right eye, we find that the loss of vision of the left eye&nbsp; might be termed&nbsp; as <i>an aggravation of disability</i> or the immediate&nbsp; sequence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; vision&nbsp; of the right eye which was admittedly due to the injury&nbsp; caused thereon while&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; was in the performance of duty in the defendant's shop.&nbsp; The&nbsp; evidence shows that after the operation of plaintiff's right eye at the Chinese General Hospital,&nbsp; he has been all along complaining of&nbsp; pains in his left eye; that such pains persisted up to and after he signed Exhibit X on July 14,&nbsp; 1948; and that accompanying such pains was the gradual dimness of his sight on that remain- ing eyfi&nbsp; until&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; completely&nbsp; disabled for industrial purposes.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand, there is&nbsp; no&nbsp; showing&nbsp; that before plaintiff suffered injury on May 27,&nbsp; 1948, his left eye was abnormal, or that the loss of vision&nbsp; of.&nbsp; that eye was due&nbsp; to causes&nbsp; other&nbsp; than the&nbsp; transferred&nbsp; infection from the&nbsp; right eye.&nbsp; The disability, therefore, of plaintiff's left eye&nbsp; is&nbsp; only traceable&nbsp; to the injury&nbsp; of his right eye, hence the general&nbsp; rule that compensation must be allowed for all the&nbsp; consequences flowing from&nbsp; 'the original&nbsp; injury and not attributable to other&nbsp; intervening causes&nbsp; should be applied.<br><br>Defendant contends, however, that there is no provision in our&nbsp; Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Act covering&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of aggravation of disability,&nbsp; but Section 2 of Act&nbsp; 3428,&nbsp; as amended by Act 3812, provides "compensation for personal injury from <i>any accident suffered</i> by an employee arising out of and&nbsp; in the course of his employment", which embraces a&nbsp; wide scope, and&nbsp; because, as stated&nbsp; above, the loss of sight&nbsp; of plaintiff's left eye&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; due to any other cause than the transferred infection from the right eye, the present case is certainly within the&nbsp; purview&nbsp; of said Sec. 2 of Act 3428 as amended, which Act should be interpreted liberally in order that the&nbsp; laborer&nbsp; may not remain unprotected, otherwise the purposes for which the law was promulgated&nbsp; might be defeated.<br><br>With&nbsp; reference to appellee's contention that&nbsp; by reason of the release agreement Exhibit X he is no longer liable to plaintiff for further compensation, we&nbsp; find the&nbsp; same to be untenable, not only because appellant positively and convincingly asserted that he signed said document on the honest belief&nbsp; that it merely referred to&nbsp; compensation for his right eye, otherwise he would not have signed it on July&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1948 as all&nbsp; along he has been suffering pains on his left eye and as early as June 17th he already noted dimness&nbsp; on that eye, but also because&nbsp; the record strongly indicates that defendant procured the signing of the agreement on July 14, 1948&nbsp; due to his eagerness to compromise the case, as soon as possible, in order&nbsp; to avoid more&nbsp; compensation than was expressed in the&nbsp; document,&nbsp; and this could be gathered from the fact that said agreement was only ratified on March 2, 1948, after he&nbsp; had received the amended&nbsp; demand&nbsp; Exhibit A, dated&nbsp; January&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1949, wherein&nbsp; the claim for the disability of&nbsp; the&nbsp; left eye was formally included.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp; Section 7 of Act 3428&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 7. <i>Contract Prohibited</i>—Any contract, regulation, or device of any sort intended to exempt the employer from all or part of the liability created&nbsp; by this Act shall be null and void." Exhibit X clearly runs counter to the aforequoted provision and cannot be invoked by defendant to secure exemp- tion&nbsp; from&nbsp; the compensation in&nbsp; question.</blockquote>In view of the foregoing,&nbsp; the decision appealed from is hereby reversed, and defendant ordered to pay plaintiff the sum of P1,446.00 sought for in the complaint, with costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i> and <i>Reyes, J.
