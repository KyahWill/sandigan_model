				G.R. No. L-1916, April 30, 1949</h4>
				<H3>PABLO C. SIBULO, PETITIONER, VS. LOPE ALTAR, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Pablo Sibulo, owner of first class agricultural land, entered 
into a contract of tenancy with Lope Altar whereby the former was to furnish the 
work animals and farm implements, the latter to defray all the expenses of 
planting and cultivation, and the net produce to be divided equally between 
them.
<p align="justify">The contract having been disapproved by the Tenancy Law 
Enforcement Division of the Department of Justice on the ground that the crop 
division therein stipulated contravenes subsection (<i>c</i>) of section 7, in 
relation to the last clause of the first paragraph of section 8 of the Tenancy 
Law, as amended, the matter was taken to the Court of Industrial Relations by 
appeal. After hearing, that court upheld the contention of the Department of 
Justice, declared the contract illegal as against public policy, and ordered 
that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"If the parties decide to continue with the proposed contract 
it should be so modified as to conform with the sharing basis above set forth; 
i.e., 60 per cent for the tenant and 40 per cent for the landlord. Should they 
deci'de to have no contract at all, then section 8 of Act No. 4054, as amended, 
shall govern."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The case is now before us on appeal by certiorari upon petition 
of Pablo Sibulo.</p>
<p align="justify">The question for determination is whether or not the contract 
involved in this case is against public policy within the intent of the Tenancy 
Law (Act No. 4054, as amended by Republic Act No. 34). Among the stipulations 
prohibited by that law as against public policy are those described in 
paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of its section 7 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<i>a</i>) If the tenant shall receive less than 55 per cent 
of the net produce, in case he furnishes the work animals and the farm 
implements, and the expenses of planting and cultivation are borne equally by 
said tenant and the landlord.</p>
<p align="justify">"(<i>c</i>) If the landlord is the owner of the work animal, 
and the tenant of the farm implements, and the expenses are equally divided 
between the landlord and the tenant, for the tenant to receive less than 50 per 
centum of the net crop."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Apparently, the contract in question does not fall squarely 
under either of the above two paragraphs; but the Court of Industrial Relations 
has taken the view that, in substance, it comes within the policy of the legal 
prohibition. There is logic in the reasoning which led the lower court to this 
conclusion. Section 8 of the Tenancy Act provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 8. <i>Share basis</i>.—In the absence of any written 
agreement to the contrary and when the tenant furnishes the necessary implements 
and the work animals and defrays all the expenses for planting and cultivation 
of the land, the crop shall be divided as follows: the tenant shall receive 70 
<i>per cent</i> of the net produce of the land and the landlord 30 <i>per 
cent</i> for first-class land, the normal production of which, based on the 
average yield for the three preceding years, is more than forty cavans of palay 
<i>per</i> one cavan of seeds; 75 <i>per cent</i> for the tenant and 25 <i>per 
cent</i> for the landlord, in case of land the average normal production of 
which is not more than forty cavans of palay <i>per</i> one cavan of seeds. In 
case the landlord furnishes the necessary work animals and farm implements and, 
likewise, bears all the expenses of planting and cultivation, the landlord shall 
receive 70 <i>per cent</i> and the tenant 30 <i>per cent</i> of the crop; but if 
the landlord furnishes the necessary work animals and farm, implements and bears 
equally with the tenant the expenses of planting and cultivation, the crop shall 
be divided equally between the parties.</p>
<p align="justify">"Expenses for harvesting and threshing shall be deducted from 
the gross produce. Expenses for the maintenance of irrigation systems within the 
respective areas shall be for the account of the tenant, but amortizations for 
the cost of construction, of the system itself shall be for the account of the 
landlord. The expenses for construction and maintenance of privately-owned 
irrigation systems shall be agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, but in 
case of disagreement, all expenses for the construction of the system shall be 
for the account of the landlord, provided that the cost of constructing the 
distribution canals shall be for the account of the tenant.</p>
<p align="center">"* * * * * * *"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Reading sections 7 and 8 together, the lower court has 
correctly determined the percentage that should correspond to each factor of 
production in the division of the crop according to the policy of the law. Says 
the court on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It is clear from sections 7 and 8 of Act No. 4054, as amended, 
that the division of the harvest depends upon the apportionment of the different 
items of expenses, such as (1) work animals, (2) farm implements, and (3) the 
expenses of planting and cultivation. The rate of percentage for every item of 
the expenses or cost of production may be obtained by the following process 
based on sections 7 and 8:</p>
<blockquote><p align="justify">'1. Under section 8, the tenant shall receive 70 per cent of 
the net product of the land and the <i>landlord</i> 30 per cent, for first class 
rice land, when the tenant furnishes the <i>farm implements</i> and the <i>work 
animals</i> and defrays <i>all the expenses for planting and cultivation</i>, 
whereas, under section 7(<i>a</i>), the tenant shall receive not less than 55 
per cent of the net produce, in case he furnishes the work animals and the 
<i>farm implements</i> and <i>one-half </i>(<i>1/2</i>)<i> of the expenses for 
planting and cultivation</i>. The difference between the share of the tenant in 
this case is 15 per cent (70 minus 55 per cent), and the said 15 per cent 
represents <i>one-half </i>(<i>1/2</i>)<i> of the expenses for planting and 
cultivation</i>, which justifies his receiving only 55 per cent of the net 
produce under section 7(<i>a</i>), because he did not furnish all (<i>2/2</i>) 
<i>the expenses of planting and cultivation</i>. Therefore, if 15 per cent 
represents 1/2 of the expenses for planting and cultivation, then 2/2 or <i>all 
the expenses for planting and cultivation</i> are equivalent to 30 per cent.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p align="justify">'If under section 8 the tenant receives 70 per cent when he 
furnishes the farm implements and work animals and defrays all the expenses of 
planting and cultivation, it must follow that the landlord is given 30 per cent 
for being the owner of the land and for his management thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">'Under the same section, if the landlord furnishes the work 
animals and farm implements and at the same time defrays all the expenses, he 
shall receive 70 per cent. It therefore follows that the remaining 30 per cent 
goes to the tenant for his labor.</p>
<p align="justify">'c. Comparing section 7(<i>c</i>), which provides that the 
tenant shall receive at least (least) 50 per cent of the net crop if he 
furnishes the <i>farm implements</i> and <i>one-half </i>(<i>1/2</i>)<i> of the 
expenses for planting and cultivation</i>, with the provisions of section 
7(<i>a</i>) where the tenant receives 55 per cent of the net produce, if he 
furnishes the <i>work animals</i> and the <i>farm implements</i> and <i>one half 
</i>(<i>1/2</i>)<i> of the expenses for planting and cultivation</i>, the 
difference between the share of the tenant in this case is 5 per cent (55 per 
cent minus 50 per cent), and the said 5 per cent represents the <i>work 
animals</i> which he did not furnish under the said section 7 (<i>c</i>). </p>
<p align="justify">'3. Under section 8, in case the landlord furnishes the <i>work 
animals</i> and <i>farm implements</i> and, likewise, bears all the <i>expenses 
of planting and cultivation</i>, the landlord shall receive 70 per cent and the 
tenant 30 per cent of the crop; whereas, under section 7(<i>c</i>) if the 
landlord is the owner of the <i>work animals</i> and the tenant of the <i>farm 
implements</i>, and the <i>expenses of planting and cultivation</i> are equally 
divided between the landlord and the tenant, the tenant should receive at least 
50 per cent of the net crop and the remaining 50 per cent pertains to the 
landlord's share. The difference between the share of the landlord in this case 
is 20 per cent (70 per cent minus 50 percent), and the said 20 per cent 
represents the <i>farm implements and one-half </i>(<i>1/2</i>)<i> of the 
expenses for planting and cultivation</i> which the said landlord did not 
furnish under section 7(<i>c</i>). Therefore, if one-half (1/2) of the expenses 
for planting and cultivation is equivalent to 15 per cent (see paragraph No. 1), 
then 20 per cent minus 15 per cent equals 5 per cent, and the said 5 per cent 
represents the percentage for <i>farm implements</i>.' </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Following the foregoing formula, the sharing ratio between the 
parties in the case at bar should be as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">"<i>For the tenant</i>—</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) 30 per cent for defraying all the expenses of planting and 
cultivation.<br>(2) 30 per cent for his labor. </p>
<p align="justify">____<br>60 per cent total share.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<i>For the landlord</i>— </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">(1) 5 per cent for furnishing the work animals.<br>(2) 5 per 
cent for furnishing the farm implements.</p>
<p align="justify">____<br>"40 per cent total 
share."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="justify">From the above computation the Court of Industrial Relations 
concludes that the contract involved in this case is against public policy as 
contemplated in section 7 of the Tenancy Law, for the reason that "instead of 
receiving 60 per cent of his total share, the tenant shall receive 50 per cent 
only."</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner takes exception to the above conclusion, 
contending that his contract with the respondent is not among those expressly 
declared to be against public policy by section 7 of the Tenancy Law, this on 
the theory that only those stipulations expressly mentioned in said section are 
outlawed as such. We cannot subscribe to this narrow interpretation of the 
Tenancy Act. In declaring certain stipulations to be against public policy, the 
legislature could not have meant to sanction other stipulations which, though 
not specified, are in effect similar to those expressly mentioned. Otherwise, by 
sutlety in the framing of the contract, the law might easily be circumvented and 
its purpose defeated.</p>
<p align="justify">The Tenancy Act is a remedial legislation intended to better 
the lot of the share-cropper by giving him a more equitable participation in the 
produce of the land which he cultivates. Being a remedial statute, it should be 
construed so as to further its purpose in accordance with the general intent of 
the lawmaker. Adopting the construction placed upon it by the petitioner would 
open the door to evasions and render the law useless.</p>
<p align="justify">The point is made that it is error to apply to the present case 
the division of crops established for the different cases specified in section 8 
of the law, since the provisions of that section apply only t in the absence of 
a written contract. It will be noted, however, that the lower court has not 
exactly applied to the case at bar the division of the crops established in said 
section, but has merely had resort thereto as an aid in determining the 
percentage which, in the opinion of the legislator, should correspond to each of 
the factors of production in the division of the crop.</p>
<p align="justify">We find no merit in the appeal and we therefore affirm the 
decision below, with costs against the petitioner.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, 
Tuason,</i> and <i>Briones, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
