				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 20, 1948, the plaintiffs filed in the Court of First 
Instance of Pampanga a complaint against defendants for the partition of a 
parcel of land situated in barrio Batasan, municipality of Macabebe, province of 
Pampanga, containing an area of about 19,527 square meters, and for the 
liquidation and accounting of the fruits thereof from 1940. On November 23, 
1948, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint for partition and reconveyance 
and for liquidation and accounting. In this amended complaint the land is 
admitted to be lot No. 50 of cadastral case No. 21, G. L. R. O. No. 981 of the 
Court of First Instance of Pampanga.
<p align="justify">The defendants, who had already filed a motion to dismiss the 
original complaint, also moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds 
that there is no cause of action and that the same is barred by a prior judgment 
and by the statute of limitations. On July 19, 1949, the Court of First Instance 
of Pampanga issued an order dismissing the complaint on the grounds that the 
land had previously been judicially adjudicated in favor of the defendants and 
that plaintiffs' right of action, if any, has prescribed. From this order the 
plaintiffs have appealed. </p>
<p align="justify">It appears from the amended complaint that lot No. 50 was 
awarded to the spouses Francisco Bartolo and Macaria Suñga in cadastral case No. 
21, G. L. R. O. No, 981 of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga, by decision 
of January 22, 1930; that on March 29, 1930, said court ordered the issuance of 
the corresponding decree of registration; that in said cadastral case Francisco 
Bartolo (predecessor in interest of the defendants) claimed ownership of the lot 
through purchase from Jose Meneses; that since the year 1929, the defendants 
have been in possession of the land, enjoying the fruits thereof exclusively, 
without giving the plaintiffs any share thereof. Assuming, therefore, that the 
plaintiffs had once been co-owners of the land, the defendants have acquired 
title by prescription over the property by reason of their adverse and exclusive 
possession from the year 1929, or very much longer than ten years before the 
filing of the complaint on October 20, 1948. (Bargayo vs. Camumot, 40 Phil., 
857; Solla vs. Ascueta et al., 49 Phil., 333.) </p>
<p align="justify">The appealed order is therefore hereby affirmed, without costs. 
So ordered. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrador, JJ.</span>, concur.</div>
