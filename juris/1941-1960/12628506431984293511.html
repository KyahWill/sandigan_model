				<BR><STRONG>PANGANIBAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a pauper's petition for a writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; certiorari to annul&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; of the Justice of the Peace Court of Santa&nbsp; Rita, Pampanga, dated&nbsp; 20 October&nbsp; 1954, ordering the petitioner to â€”<br><blockquote>(1) Vacate the&nbsp; four&nbsp; (4) parcels&nbsp; of land described in the plaintiff's complaint, thus, restoring its possession to the plaintiffs;<br><br>(2) Pay the plaintiffs&nbsp; the amount of one hundred&nbsp; and thirty (130)&nbsp; cavanes of palay, as the annual share of the plaintiffs on said land,&nbsp; or its equivalent in the sum of&nbsp; One thousand and forty (P1,040) pesos, at the&nbsp; rate of PS&nbsp; per cavan;<br><br>(3) Pay the plaintiffs the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of One&nbsp; hundred&nbsp; (Pl00) pesos, as attorney's fees; and<br><br>(4) Pay the costs&nbsp; of this&nbsp; suit.&nbsp; (Case&nbsp; No. 63.)<br></blockquote>and&nbsp; the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Pampanga,&nbsp; dated 27 December&nbsp; 1954, directing the&nbsp; execution of the&nbsp; judgment for failure&nbsp; of the petitioner to pay&nbsp; the respondents&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; of palay&nbsp; or&nbsp; its equivalent&nbsp; in money as adjudged by the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace Court or to file&nbsp; a&nbsp; supersedeas bond to&nbsp; stay the execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the judgment pending&nbsp; appeal in the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance (Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 773).<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; on 3 September 1954 the&nbsp; respondents filed a complaint for forcible entry in the Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace&nbsp; Court of Santa Rita,&nbsp; Pampanga, against the petitioner&nbsp; praying&nbsp; armmg other, that he be&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; to&nbsp; vacate the four parcels of land described in the complaint that were being cultivated by&nbsp; him without the respondents' consent.&nbsp; On 13&nbsp; September&nbsp; 1954 the petitioner&nbsp; answered the complaint and&nbsp; by way of affirmative defense averred that as&nbsp; the case involved the&nbsp; relationship of landlord and&nbsp; tenant, the Justice of the Peace Court had no jurisdiction to hear&nbsp; and decide the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding such&nbsp; objection the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court proceeded to hear&nbsp; and&nbsp; decide&nbsp; the case&nbsp; and&nbsp; on&nbsp; 20 October 1954 rendered judgment&nbsp; as&nbsp; stated&nbsp; at the beginning&nbsp; of this opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner&nbsp; appealed to the&nbsp; Court of First Instance.&nbsp; On 2 December 1954&nbsp; the petitioner filed a "motion to dismiss and/or&nbsp; to suspend proceeding" in the Court of First Instance of Pampanga on the&nbsp; ground that tenancy cases fall under the&nbsp; exclusive&nbsp; jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations pursuant to Republic Act No. 1199 approved 30 August&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; On 27&nbsp; December 1954, upon motion of the respondents,&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; ordered the execution of the judgment rendered by the Justice of the Peace Court for failure of the petitioner to pay&nbsp; the respondents&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of money as adjudged&nbsp;&nbsp; therein or to file a supersedeas&nbsp; bond&nbsp; to stay the execution of the judgment pending appeal.<br><br>When on S September 1954&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents filed their complaint for forcible entry against the&nbsp; petitioner in the Justice of the Peace Court, the&nbsp; facts pleaded therein which negative any&nbsp; landlord-tenant&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; between&nbsp; the respondents and the&nbsp; petitioner, the Justice&nbsp; of the Peace Court&nbsp; of Santa Rita, Pampanga, acquired jurisdiction of the case.&nbsp; When on 13 September 1954 the petitioner filed his answer averring, among&nbsp; other defenses, that there was such relationship and for that reason the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court&nbsp; had no jurisdiction over the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; by such defense did not lose nor was it deprived of its jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when the evidence presented at the hearing showed that the&nbsp; possession of the parcels of&nbsp; land was held by the petitioner's grandfather for many years,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the respondents'&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; to support&nbsp; their&nbsp; claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; he had&nbsp; returned&nbsp; the possession thereof on account&nbsp; of his inability to continue cultivating the&nbsp; same due to&nbsp; advanced age&nbsp; was&nbsp; contradicted&nbsp; by the petitioner's to the effect that&nbsp; he was holding possession&nbsp; thereof as tenant, successor of his&nbsp; grandfather, supported&nbsp; by the fact that he had held possession thereof for at least one agricultural year, because&nbsp; if such possession were not true the respondents would not have prayed&nbsp; for their share in the&nbsp; produce of the parcels of land,&nbsp; the Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace&nbsp; Court should&nbsp; have concluded that there was such relationship by preponderance of evidence&nbsp; and dismissed the complaint.&nbsp; Section 21&nbsp; of Republic Act No. 1199, approved on SO August 1954, provides :<br><br>All cases involving the dispossession of a tenant by the landlord or a third party and/or the&nbsp; settlement and disposition of disputes arising from the relationship of&nbsp; landlord and&nbsp; tenant, as well&nbsp; as" tho violation' of any provisions of this Act,&nbsp; shall be under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of such court as may now hereafter be authorized by law to take cognizance&nbsp; of tenancy relations and disputes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>And the conclusion&nbsp; would be reasonable and logical&nbsp; in view of the provisions of&nbsp; section 9, Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1199, to the effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; upon the extinction of the tenancy relationship by the voluntary surrender of the land by the tenant,&nbsp; "his heirs or the&nbsp; members of his immediate&nbsp; farm household may continue to work the land until the close of the agricultural year,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and of the finding by the Justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Peace Court&nbsp; that "the defendant had&nbsp; been working&nbsp; together&nbsp; with his&nbsp; grandfather, Ciriaco Basilio, ever since he was fifteen years old on&nbsp; the said&nbsp; land&nbsp; as helper *&nbsp; * *."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> His dispossession by the respondents&nbsp; of the four parcels of land is a controversy that falls within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of fact&nbsp; on 3&nbsp; November 1954 the&nbsp; petitioner filed a petition with the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations praying that the controversy between him&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Zoila David be determined' and that he be reinstated&nbsp; in,his&nbsp; landholding (Annex Q).<br><br>True, there is a&nbsp; defect of party respondents by the failure&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioner to&nbsp; join as respondents the courts whose judgment and&nbsp; order&nbsp; are sought&nbsp; to be annulled. However,&nbsp; the defect&nbsp; may be cured by allowing,&nbsp; as it&nbsp; is hereby allowed, the&nbsp; amendment of the petition to include the courts as respondents.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts can allege no&nbsp; new or additional facts&nbsp; which&nbsp; would&nbsp; alter&nbsp; the&nbsp; conclusion arrived at and consequently after the amendment shall&nbsp; have been made within ten days frorii notice of this decision, let judgment be entered granting the writ prayed for.<br><br>The&nbsp; decision of the Justice&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Peace&nbsp; Court&nbsp; dated 20&nbsp; October 1954&nbsp; and the order of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; dated&nbsp; 27; December 1954 are annulled, with costs against the respondents except the&nbsp; Courts.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Jugo, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J.
