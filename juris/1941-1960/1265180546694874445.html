				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a&nbsp; petition for certiorari and&nbsp; prohibition with preliminary injunction by Teotimo&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Saavedra, Carolina Layague and Filemon&nbsp; Lucasan,&nbsp; to annul amended order of the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Zamboanga, dated&nbsp; August 23, 1957, and to enjoin said court from placing respondent Siari Valley&nbsp; Estates, Inc.,&nbsp; in&nbsp; possession of Lot No. 8&nbsp; of Parcel No. 11 and of Parcel No. 9, mentioned in said order. In Civil Case No. 134 of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Zamboanga del Norte,&nbsp; entitled Siari Valley Estates, Inc., <i>vs.</i> Filemon Lucasan, a decision was rendered on June 30, 1952, the dispositive&nbsp; part of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>". . . adjudicating to the Siari Valley&nbsp; Estates all the cattle that may be found in the cattle ranch of Filemon Lucasan, specially the 321 heads that had been&nbsp; entrusted to&nbsp; his care . . . ordering the defendant&nbsp; to deliver to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; (respondent herein)&nbsp; all said cattle or their value amounting to P40,000.00, .to pay damages to the Siari Valley Estates for the&nbsp; 400 heads of cattle. .&nbsp; . at the rate&nbsp; of P100.00 per head or P40,000,&nbsp; plus interest&nbsp; at the rate of 6% from the date of the trial of&nbsp; this&nbsp; case in January, 1951, and to pay the costs of the proceeding."<br></blockquote>To satisfy the judgment, levy was made on twelve&nbsp; parcels of land,&nbsp; among them Lot&nbsp; 8 of&nbsp; Parcel 11 and Parcel&nbsp; 9, involved in the parcel petition, which twelve parcels were later sold at public auction on January 14, 1956, to Siari Estates, being the highest bidder.&nbsp; Two&nbsp; days before the sale, petitioners&nbsp; Saavedra and Layague&nbsp; filed with&nbsp; the Sheriff their third party claims to Lot No. 8, Parcel 11 and Parcel 9,&nbsp; respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other third&nbsp; party claimants filed their claims to the other&nbsp; parcels levied upon,&nbsp; and subsequently, they filed the corresponding suits for annulment of the execution sale, against the Siari Estates&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Sheriff, which cases are now pending in the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del&nbsp; Norte.<br><br>After the expiration of one year from the date&nbsp; of the sale, a&nbsp; final deed of safe covering the twelve parcels was executed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Sheriff, in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; Siari Estates. Thereafter, the Siari Estates tried to obtain possession of the properties bought by it, but it was opposed by defendant&nbsp; Lucasan, claiming that the parcels sold at the&nbsp; execution sale were&nbsp; owned and possessed by third party claimants, the same persons who had&nbsp; filed their third&nbsp; party claims with the Sheriff and had brought the corresponding actions in court against the Siari Estates to annul&nbsp; the execution sale.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite&nbsp; said opposition, however, the trial court, through Judge Ortega, issued an order dated February&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1957, supplemented&nbsp; by&nbsp; a&nbsp; writ of possession, directing the Provincial Sheriff to deliver&nbsp; to the Siari Estates all the&nbsp; properties covered by the final deed of sale. Said order,&nbsp; however, was refused compliance by defendant Lucasan; and the failure of the Sheriff to execute the order and&nbsp; the writ of possession prompted the Siari Estates to ask&nbsp; that said writ be implemented and to pray that&nbsp; the Sheriff&nbsp; be directed to deliver all properties covered&nbsp; by the deed of sale, to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant Lucasan, as well as the third party claimants, opposed the motion,&nbsp; alleging that since they (third party claimants)&nbsp; were in&nbsp; actual possession of the properties, they could not be deprived thereof, pending determination of their claims&nbsp; of ownership, nor could they be summarily ousted therefrom without due process.&nbsp; The trial court heard the motion and the oppositions thereto, and&nbsp; after receiving&nbsp; evidence,&nbsp; it&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; % 3; 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were&nbsp; covered either by homestead&nbsp; or free patents&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of third party claimants,&nbsp; and&nbsp; it issued&nbsp; an&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; April&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; directing the Sheriff to—<br><blockquote>***"place the plaintiff in possession of parcels Nos. 1, 9, Lot 8 in parcel No. 11 and parcel 12 and of all other parcels mentioned in the Certificate of Sale issued&nbsp; by the Provincial Sheriff&nbsp; in favor of the plaintiff."<br></blockquote>On motion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the defendant and the third party claimants, the trial court on August 7, 1957, amended its order of April 30, 1957, by striking therefrom parcel 12, and the phrase "and&nbsp; of&nbsp; all other parcels, etc.", so&nbsp; as to read:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore, premises considered the Provincial Sheriff is hereby ordered to place the plaintiff in possession of Parcel Nos.&nbsp; 1, 9 and Lot No. 8 in Parcel No. 11 as mentioned and&nbsp; described in the Sheriff sale issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; the provincial sheriff in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; the plaintiff." ( Annex J, Petition, p. 47, Record)<br></blockquote>Dissatisfied with the last order, defendant&nbsp; and the third party claimants&nbsp; moved to reconsider the same, attacking ihe validity of the execution sale.&nbsp; Acting on said motion, the trial court sustained defendant's&nbsp; claim as to&nbsp; Parcel No. 1, holding that the sale of&nbsp; said parcel was invalid, for the reason that it turned out later that it was registered property, covered by a certificate of title,&nbsp; the Provincial Fiscal having failed to make reference to the&nbsp; number&nbsp; of said certificate and the volume and page of the registration book where said certificate was entered.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as to parcel 3 and lot 8 of parcel 11, the&nbsp; court observed that defendant . Lucasan did not act in&nbsp; good faith in transferring them to third parties,&nbsp; said transfers&nbsp; having&nbsp; been made&nbsp; in fraud&nbsp; of creditors.&nbsp; The trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; found that&nbsp; Parcel 9&nbsp; originally belonged to&nbsp; Filemon Lucasan,&nbsp; but was later sold to his own son, Lorenzo&nbsp; Lucasan, on&nbsp; June 4,&nbsp; 1955, who in turn&nbsp; sold it on January 10, 1956, to third party claimant Carolina Layague, second cousin&nbsp; of Natividad Castellano, wife of Filemon Lucasan himself; while Lot 8 of Parcel 11, originally belonging to&nbsp; Filemon&nbsp; Lucasan, was sold by him to his own daughter Bruna on September 24, 1954, who in turn sold it on November 19, 1955, to third party claimant Teotimo&nbsp; Saavedra.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial court also said that&nbsp; Parcel&nbsp; 9&nbsp; and Lot 8 of Parcel 11,&nbsp; were not specifically described&nbsp; in the notice of sale made&nbsp; by the Sheriff.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; prejudice to determining the question of ownership and possession raised by the petitioner in their complaint to annul execution sale, the lower court ordered the Sheriff to give to the Siari Estates possession of Lot No. 8 of Parcel&nbsp; 11 and Parcel 9.&nbsp; The dispositive part of said order,&nbsp; dated August 23, 1957,&nbsp; (now subject of this petition)&nbsp; reads:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore, premises considered, the Provincial Sheriff is ordered to give to the plaintiff the possession of Lot&nbsp; No. 8 parcel 11 and parcel 9, as mentioned and&nbsp; described in the Sheriff's sale issued by the Provincial Sheriff in favor of the plaintiff."<br></blockquote>Not satisfied with the above order, third party claimants filed the present petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners Saavedra and Layague contend that the lower court acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction for&nbsp; the reason that they were not parties in the original case and, therefore,&nbsp; may not be bound by the judgment; that inasmuch as they were in actual possession of the property,&nbsp; adverse to the debtor, they may not be ordered ejected; that there was no valid levy and in the notice of sale, the parcels&nbsp; involved were not&nbsp; specifically described; and lastly, that they were not given their&nbsp; day in court.<br><br>Where a parcel levied upon on execution is occupied by a party&nbsp; other&nbsp; than a judgment&nbsp; debtor, the procedure is for the court to order a hearing to determine&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature of said&nbsp; adverse possession.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the case&nbsp; of Omaña <i>vs.</i> Gatulayao (73 Phil.,&nbsp; 66, 68),&nbsp; this&nbsp; Tribunal said:<br><br><blockquote>"* * * Judgment rendered in actions <span style="font-style: italic;">in personam</span>, as the instant case, are enforcible only between the parties&nbsp; and their successors in interests, but not against strangers thereto.&nbsp; (Sec. 306, par. 2, of Act No. 190, now Rule 39, sec. 44 (b), Rules of Court.)&nbsp; There may be cases when the actual possessor may be claimed to be a privy to any of the parties to the action, or&nbsp; his bona-fide possession may be disputed, or&nbsp; where it is alleged, as in the instant case, that such possession has been taken in connivance with the defeated litigant with a view&nbsp; to frustrating the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any of these&nbsp; events, the&nbsp; proper procedure would be to order a hearing on the matter of such possession and to deny or accede to the&nbsp; enforcement of a writ of possession as&nbsp; the finding shall warrant. * * *"</blockquote><br><br>The&nbsp; reason for this hearing wherein the adverse possessors are given an opportunity to present their evidence and justify their&nbsp; possession, is given by the Court in the case of Gozon <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; De&nbsp; la Rosa&nbsp; (77 Phil., 919, 922),&nbsp; thus:<br><blockquote>"es necesario este&nbsp; procedimiento sumario para evitar que algunas personas, para frustrar los verdaderos fines de la ley, invoquen sin razon alguna la teoria de sentencia in personam:&nbsp; que&nbsp; no han sido demandadas; que la orden de ejecucion no va contra ellas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Entonces habria que demandar a todas las personas que dependen del demandado o que ocupan la casa por consentimiento solo del demandado. Una persona cualquiera podria ponerse en combinacion con el ejecutado y, entrando en la casa, invocar la defensa de que no ha sido parte de la causa contra&nbsp; la orden de ejecucion."<br></blockquote>And in the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Sheriff&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; (77 Phil., 740, 743-44), this Court said:<br><blockquote>"La sentencia dictada en el presente asuiito es in personam, y como tal solo es obligatoria para las partes y no para extranos.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Art. 44. par.&nbsp; (b), Regla 39.)&nbsp; Si el recurrente Anacleto&nbsp; Santiago, que no fue parte en la&nbsp; causa por desahucio, era poseedor de buena&nbsp; fe&nbsp; de la finca&nbsp; en cuestion,&nbsp; la sentencia dictada en&nbsp; dicha causa no&nbsp; podia ejecutarse&nbsp; vaiidamente contra&nbsp; el. Se puede&nbsp; insistir, sin embargo, en la ejecucion&nbsp; de la sentencia si&nbsp; se&nbsp; prueba que el&nbsp; poseedor&nbsp; es simplemente un causahabierite, o un huesped, o un&nbsp; agente del ejecutado en&nbsp; el&nbsp; proposito fraudulento&nbsp; de&nbsp; frustrar&nbsp; la&nbsp; sentencia; en tal caso, debe haber un&nbsp; procedimiento en&nbsp; el Juzgado&nbsp; de Primera Instancia que expidio la orden&nbsp; de&nbsp; ejecucion para la&nbsp; dilucidacion del caracter&nbsp; de&nbsp; la posesion del&nbsp; ocupante extraiio."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; <br></div><br>" .&nbsp; . .Si en tal procedimiento el juzgado encuentra que el extraño no es mas que un mero causahabiente o agente a huesped del ejecutado, entonces&nbsp; se&nbsp; seguira la orden&nbsp; de&nbsp; ejecucion contra el.&nbsp; Esto no es obice, sin embargo, para que el ocupante pueda valerse de cualquier&nbsp; otro remedio legal&nbsp; para la determinaci6n definitiva&nbsp; del titulo o la posesion&nbsp; sobre la propiedad."<br></blockquote>It will be observed that after the hearing, the trial court made&nbsp; the finding that petitioners were presumably party to the scheme to defraud the judgment creditor, being the assigness or transferees of the&nbsp; parcels in question after judgment had been rendered&nbsp; against&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Filemon Lucasan,&nbsp; their/predecessor in interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently, the court did not err in&nbsp; ordering the Sheriff to deliver possession to the creditor, Siari Valley Estates.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; petitioners herein still have their remedy in court by prosecuting the actions filed by them to vindicate their claims to the properties in question.&nbsp; In the case of Madrigal,<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs.</span> Planas, 94&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 754, 759), we said:<br><blockquote>"Anent the order of&nbsp; respondent Judge dated Feb.,2, 1953,&nbsp; which directs that Jose Isla, Carlos Neri, Jose T. Jose, Juan Planas and the San Miguel Brewery, Inc. vacate the land of plaintiff pursuant to the judgment of&nbsp; the court in the ejectment case, which&nbsp; order, is now attacked as illegal because they were not parties to that&nbsp; case; the record shows that before issuing said order, the court&nbsp; conducted summary hearing to determine the nature of the possession of the property claimed by Juan Planas and&nbsp; other occupants, and that at that hearing respondent judge&nbsp; summoned&nbsp; all of them to appear to show cause why they should not be ejected from the premises. And after the hearing was over, respondent Judge found that Juan Planas and the other occupants were&nbsp; mere transferees or possessors pendente lite&nbsp; of the property in question. Respondent judge found that if they had any right at all to occupy the property that right is merely&nbsp; subsidiary to that of defendant&nbsp; Concepcion L. Planas.<br>As such, they are bound by the judgment rendered against the latter in consonance with the doctrine laid&nbsp; down in the cases of Brodett <i>vs.</i> De la&nbsp; Rosa, 77 Phil., 752; 44 Off. Gaz., No, 3, pp.&nbsp; 874-875, and Gozon <i>vs.</i> De la Rosa,&nbsp; 77 Phil., 919;&nbsp; 44 Off. Gaz., pp. 1227-1228. Of course, there are questions of fact as to which there may be controversy, but the proper place where this&nbsp; should be threshed out is not in this proceedings, but&nbsp; in&nbsp; an ordinary action.&nbsp; For the present, we are satisfied that the respondent Judge has acted on the matter in the exercise of his sound discretion."<br></blockquote>As regards the contention that there was no valid levy and notice of sale because the parcels were not specifically described, after examining the record, we are satisfied that the parcels in question&nbsp; could have been easily identified from the description contained in the levy;&nbsp; and as to the notice of sale, it was duly published in the newspaper Vanguard, published in Dumaguete City and of general circulation in Zamboanga&nbsp; del&nbsp; Norte, this, aside from the fact that petitioners had actual notice of said levy, otherwise, they would not have filed their third party claims before the execution sale.<br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the foregoing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of certiorari and prohibition is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; denied,&nbsp; with costs against petitioners.&nbsp; The writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is ordered dissolved.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
