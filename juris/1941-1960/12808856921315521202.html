				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an action to compel defendant to accept certain mining 
shares bought for him by plaintiff in 1937 and to pay for the price of 
the same after deduction of the sum advanced by him on account of the 
said price.  Defendant denied his liability and, when the case was 
called for trial, asked for the dismissal of the case on the ground of 
moratorium.  The motion was granted but, upon appeal to this Court, the 
order of dismissal was set aside and the case remanded to the court of 
origin so that defendant could produce proof that he had presented a war
 damage claim since the debts sued upon came within the purview of 
sections 2 and 3 of Republic Act No. 342, without prejudice to 
plaintiff's raising the question of the constitutionality of said Act in
 the court below.  This the plaintiff did in a pleading subsequently 
filed in the trial court.  But that court, after trial, found that 
defendant had filed his war damage claim, and being of the opinion that 
the Act in question was constitutional, rendered a decision dismissing 
the action.  From this decision plaintiff appealed to this Court, and 
the only issue is the constitutionality of the Act.  As this Court has 
already declared the said Act unconstitutional in the case of Rutter vs.
 Esteban, G. R. No. L-3708, promulgated May 18, 1953 (49 Off. Gaz., 
1807), the defense of moratorium set up by defendant can no longer be 
upheld.
  <p>    Wherefore, the decision appealed from is ordered set aside and 
the case remanded to the court below for further proceedings.  Without 
costs.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
