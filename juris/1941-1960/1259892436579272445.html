				<H3>OTILLO R. GOROSPE AND VITALIANO GOROSPE, PETITIONERS, VS. MAGNO S. GATMAITAN, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA,  CEFERINA SAMU, FRANCISCO DE LA FUENTE, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari which seeks&nbsp; to set aside an order of&nbsp; respondent judge rendered, on August 2, 1955 in criminal&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 29736&nbsp; entitled People of the Philipines <i>vs. </i> Cef erina Samu, et al., pending in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila, granting the motion of defendants to disqualify&nbsp; the, counsel for the&nbsp; private 'prosecution&nbsp; to intervene in behalf of the offended party.<br><br>On October 6,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; petitioners filed&nbsp; an action&nbsp; in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan against respondents Ceferina Samu, Ester Campus <i>alias</i> Rosa Lopez, Carmelita de la Cruz alias Josefina Dizon, and the General Indemnity Co.,&nbsp; Inc., to&nbsp; annul certain&nbsp; contracts entered into by the latter and to recover the damages they suffered as a consequence thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; initiative of petitioners,&nbsp; an action&nbsp; for estafa through falsification of a&nbsp; private document was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the same&nbsp; respondents, with&nbsp; the exception of the insurance&nbsp; company, who,&nbsp; upon arraignment, pleaded not guilty&nbsp; to the charge.<br><br>Ester Campus filed a petition in the criminal case praying that the&nbsp; counsel for the offended parties be prevented from intervening on the ground that the latter have already filed a&nbsp; civil action for the annulment of the same documents involved in the criminal case and for the recovery of damages resulting therefrom, and as such they&nbsp; have no right nor authority to assist the&nbsp; fiscal,in the prosecution of the case.&nbsp; The trial court found the petition meritorious and disauthorized the private prosecutor to intervene in behalf of the&nbsp; oil ended parties.&nbsp; A motion to reconsider the order was filed which was denied in an order entered on August 2, 1955.&nbsp; To set aside this order, the present&nbsp; petition for certiorari has been interposed.<br><br>It appears that, upon the instance of petitioners, an action for estafa&nbsp; through falsification of&nbsp; a private&nbsp; document was filed by the city fiscal of Manila against respondents Ceferina Samu,&nbsp; Ester Campus,&nbsp; Carmelita de la Cruz and Francisco de la Fuente who, upon arraignment, pleaded not guilty to the charge.&nbsp; It likewise appears that before the&nbsp; institution of the criminal ease petitioners filed an action against the same respondents for annulment of the same documents involved in the criminal case for damages resulting&nbsp; from their execution.&nbsp; The attorneys&nbsp; for&nbsp; the offended&nbsp; parties entered their appearance in the criminal case but, upon petition&nbsp; of respondent Ester Campus, they were&nbsp; prevented from doing&nbsp; so on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that,&nbsp; the offended parties&nbsp; having already instituted&nbsp; a&nbsp; civil action, they.have no right nor&nbsp; authority to be represented in the criminal case.&nbsp;&nbsp; Has respondent judge abused his discretion in issuing the order of disqualification?<br><br>Section&nbsp; 15, Rule 106 provides that "Unless the offended party has Waived the&nbsp; civil action or&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; reserved the, right to institute it after the termination of the criminal case&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * he may intervene, personally&nbsp; or&nbsp; by attorney, in the&nbsp; prosecution of the&nbsp; offense."&nbsp; The&nbsp; wording of the law is clear.&nbsp; It states that an offended party may intervene, personally or by attorney, in the prosecution of the offense if&nbsp; he has&nbsp; not waived the civil action&nbsp; or&nbsp; expressly reserved&nbsp; his&nbsp; right to&nbsp; institute&nbsp; it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; reason&nbsp; of the law in not&nbsp; permitting the offended&nbsp; party&nbsp; to&nbsp; intervene in the&nbsp; prosecution of&nbsp; the offense if he&nbsp; has waived or reserved his right to institute the civil action is that by such action his interest in the criminal case has disappeared. Its prosecution becomes the&nbsp; sole function of the public prosecutor.&nbsp; This is our ruling in the decisions&nbsp; hitherto rendered in this jurisdiction&nbsp; interpreting the above provision of our rules of court.<br><br>In&nbsp; People<i> vs.</i> Maceda,&nbsp; 73&nbsp; Phil., 676, this court said that "the&nbsp; offended party&nbsp; may, as of right,&nbsp; intervene in the prosecution of a criminal&nbsp; action,&nbsp; <i>but then only when,</i> from the nature of the offense, he is entitled to indemnity and&nbsp; <i>his action&nbsp; therefor has not&nbsp; by him been waived or expressly reserved."</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics supplied,)&nbsp;&nbsp; The same ruling Was reiterated in People vs. Velez, 77 Phil., 1026 and People <i>vs.</i> Capistrano, 90&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 823.&nbsp; In the former&nbsp; case, we. said,&nbsp; "The reason&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law&nbsp;&nbsp; in not&nbsp; permitting the offended party to intervene in the prosecution of a criminal case if&nbsp; he&nbsp; has waived his right to institute a civil action arising&nbsp; from the criminal act, or&nbsp; has reserved or, a <i>fortiori, already instituted the said civil action,</i> is that he has no special interest in&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution of the&nbsp; criminal action."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)&nbsp; And in another case we likewise said that since&nbsp; the offended&nbsp; party has already filed a civil&nbsp; action arising from the criminal act,&nbsp; "he has no right to intervene in the prosecution of the case"&nbsp; (People <i>vs.</i> Olavides, 80 Phil., 280; 45 Off. Gaz., 3834).<br><br>It therefore appears from the foregoing that an offended party losses his right to intervene in the prosecution of a criminal case, not only when he has waived the civil action or&nbsp; expressly reserved his right to&nbsp; institute&nbsp; it, but) also when he&nbsp; has actually instituted the civil action even if he has not made the waiver or reservation above adverted to.&nbsp;&nbsp; This ruling is&nbsp; further strengthened by Article 33 of the new Civil Code, which provides that "In cases of defamation,'fraud,&nbsp; and&nbsp; physical&nbsp; injuries, a&nbsp; civil action for damages, entirely separate and&nbsp; distinct&nbsp; from the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party", and that such action may proceed independently of the criminal "and for its&nbsp; determination preponderance of evidence would, suffice. The present case comes within the purview of&nbsp; this provision.<br><br>Petition is&nbsp; denied,, with costs against petitioners.<br><br><i>Par√°s,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
