				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal by certiorari from a decision and a resolution of the Court of Industrial Relations.<p></p>
<p>The petitioner Bay View Hotel Employees' Union is a legitimate labor
organization within the meaning of Republic Act No. 875, the respondent
Bay View Hotel, Inc. is a corporation duly organized and existing under
the laws of the Philippines, and the other respondents are officers of
the said corporation.</p>
<p>On June 9, 1954, the petitioner, represented by its president,
Antonio V. Policarpio, and the respondent corporation, represented by
its Executive vice president, Mrs. Esperanza Zamora, entered into a
working agreement providing, among other things, for the recognition of
the aforesaid union as the sole collective bargaining agency for all
the employees of the hotel, and for the setting up of a Labor
Management Committee for the settlement of disputes arising under the
agreement in the course of the relationship between the said petitioner
and respondents.</p>
<p>On February 18, 1955, the petitioner union filed with the Court of
Industrial Relations a complaint for unfair labor practice against the
herein respondents, alleging that the latter had discriminated against
Antonio V. Policarpio, president of the union, and six (6) security
guards, namely, Raymundo de la Cruz, Moises Montoya, Ubaldo Luna,
Nicasio Aquino, Timoteo Manalo, and Toribio Macapagal, with regard to
terms or conditions of employment in order to discourage membership in
the union or because of union membership or activity, in violation of
section 4(a), sub-paragraph 4 of Republic Act 875, committed thus:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(a) That shortly after the execution of the
collective bargaining agreement entered into by and between the Bay
View Hotel Employees' Union and the Bay View Hotel, Inc. on June 19,
1954, respondent Floro Santos, Jr. required Antonio Policarpio to turn
over his work to two (2) new employees hired by the respondents; and
that at the suggestion of respondent Floro Santos, Jr., Antonio
Policarpio approached Mrs. Esperanza Zamora who told him to just sit
behind his desk for the whole eight (8) hours a day with pay;</p>
  <p>"(b)
That more or less at the same time, respondent Floro Santos, Jr.
demoted six (6) security guards named above by assigning them as linen,
room and elevator boys thereby depriving them of their coffee
allowances and insurance benefits.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The complaint further alleged that respondents also committed unfair
labor practice under section 4 (a) sub-paragraph 6 in relation to
section 13 of Republic Act 875, in refusing to bargain collectively in
good faith with the union relative to some four-point demand or
grievance submitted to the management of the respondent hotel, after
the execution and during the effectivity of the collective bargaining
agreement, committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"(a) That after the execution and during the
lifetime of the collective bargaining agreement, complainant union
submitted to the management of respondent Hotel 4-point demands or
grievances, one of which is the withdrawal of the coffee allowances
given to and enjoyed before by respondent's telephone operators;</p>
  <p>"(b)
That said 4-point demands or grievances having been submitted to the
Labor Management Committee provided for in clause No. 10 in relation
with clauses Nos. 2 and 14 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement for
settlement of differences, said committee, after hearing, handed down a
unanimous decision recommending to the management of respondent Hotel
the grant of the demands or grievances of complainant union;</p>
  <p>"(c)
That despite the unanimous decision of the Labor Management Committee,
respondents refused to comply therewith and even failed to answer said
demands or grievances;</p>
  <p> (d) That when the representatives of
complainant union approached Mrs. Esperanza Zamora to ask her to
consider the unanimous recommendation of the Labor Management Committee
on the 4-point demands or grievances, Mrs. Esperanza Zamora refused to
do so, which caused the complainant union to serve a copy of the notice
of its intention to declare a strike on November, 1954, and the actual
declaration of the strike on January 1, 1955."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answering the complaint, the respondents maintained that Policarpio
was not discharged nor suspended but was merely assigned to work in the
office, this step having been taken because the said employee had not
been performing his duties properly and efficiently, had wasted his
time and loitered uselessly during office hours, and had usurped a
function not assigned to him, thereby disrupting the smooth functioning
of the organization.</p>
<p>Respondents claimed further that the action taken on the six (6)
security guards was prompted by the fact that those guards had been lax
in their vigilance so much so that an inventory showed that at least
eight (8) table radio receiving sets belonging to the hotel were
missing and none of the said security guards could account for them.</p>
<p>As to the alleged refusal to bargain, the respondents denied
altogether such claim, asserting that they acted in accordance with the
collective bargaining agreement and that the employer has the right to
approve or disapprove the decision of the Labor Management Committee.</p>
<p>Upon joining of the issues, the case was heard by a trial examiner
of the Court of Industrial Relations. And after trial, during which
oral and documentary evidence were presented by both parties, the case
was submitted for decision.</p>
<p>The respondents were absolved of the charges on October 6, 1955.
Reconsideration of the decision having been denied by a resolution of
the lower court <em>en banc</em>, concurred in by Judges Arsenio I.
Martinez, Juan L. Lanting and V. Jimenez Yanson, and dissented to by
Judge Jose S. Bautista, the petitioner has brought the case to us for
review.</p>
<p>The first issue raised is whether or not the assignment of
Policarpio and the six (6) security guards to other positions
constitute discrimination. Paragraph 2 of the "Working Agreement"
entered into by the petitioner union and the respondent employer
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"2. <em>Management Supervision.</em>â€”Subject'" to
the conditions of this agreement, the operation of the hotel and the
supervision control and rotation of the employees therein shall be
vested in the EMPLOYER, including the right to suspend and/or discharge
for cause, depending upon the nature and gravity of the offense,
provided, however, that any member of the UNION with a complaint or
grievance shall have the right to present same to the EMPLOYER or the
"Labor Management Committee" hereinafter established.</p>
  <p> "Cause means, but is not restricted to, the following: </p>
  <p>"(a) Fraud or breach of trust in the work intrusted to the employees;</p>
  <p>"(b) Tardiness  and  drunkenness  interfering  with employment; </p>
  <p>"(c)  Incompetence  and inefficiency; </p>
  <p>"(d)  Violation  of  a  company  policy;</p>
  <p>"(e)  Violation of reasonable company rules  and regulations; </p>
  <p>"(f) Misfeasance or malfeasance in the performance of duties or towards the employer;</p>
  <p>"(g)  Failure to observe proper discipline;</p>
  <p>"(h)  Unprovoked insolvence or disrespect on the part of the employee toward the employer or the latter's representative;</p>
  <p>"(i)
Refusal to be transferred from one position to another in the same
organization (Bay View Hotel) provided that the transfer shall not
amount to an unjustified demotion or undue discrimination; </p>
  <p>"(j)  Competing with  employer's  business; </p>
  <p>"(k) Immoral,  disreputable  and unbecoming  conduct;   and </p>
  <p>"(l)  Other similar  reasons."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the employer is entitled to operate the hotel and
supervise, control and rotate the employees thereof, And as may be
inferred from item (i) of the above-quoted provision of the working
agreement, the employer may also transfer its employees from one
position to another in the same organization, "provided that the
transfer shall not amount to an unjustified demotion or undue
discrimination." On this point, the only question left for us to
determine is whether there was demotion or undue discrimination in the
transfers of Policarpio and the security guards to their new
assignments.</p>
<p>It appears that before the transfer of Policarpio to his new office
assignment, he had the duties of mailing letters, collecting accounts,
assisting the chief accountant and paying taxes and various matters at
the City Hall. Supporting its claim that Policarpio had been
discriminated against, the petitioner union made imputations of
anti-union attitude on the part of the Executive Vice-President of the
respondent company, which, however, were not substantiated. Apart from
the fact that the said imputations were vigorously denied by the
respondent, the lower court observed that Policarpio, as a witness for
petitioner was unreliable. Thus, while he averred that he was an
Accounting Clerk, the payrolls and a description of his real duties
show that he was a mere clerk-messenger. On the other hand, the Court
of Industrial Relations found that the cause of Policarpio's
reassignment was his inefficiency and tardinessâ€”a valid cause under the
agreement. And we find no reason why this factual finding should be
disturbed. </p>
<p>Likewise, the allegation that the transfer of the six security
guards' amounted to a demotion has not been established. For as found
by the court below, their salaries were not decreased and there had
been no indication that their transfer was motivated by their union
affiliation or union activities. As correctly stated by the lower
court, the anti-union attitude charges against the respondents are
belied by: "first, the management voluntarily entered into a working
agreement with complainant union even without the instrumentality of a
certification election, which working agreement practically gave almost
all the demands of the union. Second, the union was the recipient of
moral and financial aids when the basketball and bowling teams were
provided with uniforms and their members afforded a chance to earn
additional income in the shoe-shine concession."</p>
<p>Considering that the transfer of these employees from their old
positions was effected after they had proved themselves to be incapable
of efficiently doing their duties, the said transfer was nothing but a
protective and corrective measure on the part of the respondent.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * Fair play requires that the company assume
the responsibility of giving new opportunity to employees who have
performed their tasks conscientiously, but have failed in a particular
job on account of lack of ability to do it well or because of an
absence of interest in it. In another position, the worker may prove
unusually competent." (The Management of Labor Relations by Watkins and
Dodd, p. 298).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon the whole, we believe that the holding of the lower court to
the effect that the transfer of complainants to other positions was a
valid exercise by the respondent corporation of its right in accordance
with the provisions of the working agreement above-quoted is correct.</p>
<p>As to the alleged breach of the collective bargaining agreement,
petitioner contends that under paragraph 14 of the said agreement the
decision of the Labor Management Committee on disputes between the
employer and the employee, as those covered by the 4-point demands, are
final and may not be disturbed by the employer. This contention is not
well taken. The pertinent provisions of the agreement readâ€”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"10. <em>Labor Management Committee.</em>â€”A 'Labor
Management Committee' composed of two members elected by the UNION and
two members to be designated by the EMPLOYER shall be immediately
constituted. The Committee shall, upon the instance of the employee
concerned, investigate all cases involving, according to present rules
and practices, not more than three (3) days of suspension. The
Committee's decision in such cases shall be binding on both parties. In
cases involving more than three (3) days of suspension, the Committee
shall likewise investigate the employee concerned and make its report
and recommendation to the EMPLOYER. The EMPLOYER shall decide the case
and its decision shall be final and binding, provided, however, that if
said decision of the EMPLOYER overrules the recommendation of the
Committee THE UNION MAY APPEAL THE SAME within five (5) days in which
case the matter shall be submitted to the Conciliation Service of the
Department of Labor. * * *"</p>
  <p>"14. <em>Settlement of Disputes.</em>â€”The
parties shall endeavor to maintain harmonious, just and cooperative
relations with each other, so that efficiency may be achieved for the
benefit both of labor and management. To this end, they agree that,
during the term of this agreement, their relations shall be governed by
the provisions thereof, which they mutually undertake to carry into
effect with the utmost good faith. However, in case of any
disagreement, they shall refer the same to the Labor Management
Committee created in Paragraph 8 hereof."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first place, there is nothing in paragraph 14 stating that
the decision of the committee shall be final. If the contracting
parties to the collective bargaining agreement really intended to
include such a rule, they would have expressed it in unequivocal terms
as in paragraph 10 wherein it is clearly ordained that the "committee's
decision in such cases shall be binding on both parties." In the
absence of any such provision in the agreement, the rule applicable
would be section 13 of Republic Act 875 stating that the duty to
bargain collectively does not compel any party to agree to a proposal
or to make concession.</p>
<p> Paragraph 14 merely provides that the disagreement be referred to
the Labor Management Committee. Reference to the committee was so done
in this case, but it appears that the said committee itself would not
and, in fact, did not, interpret paragraph 14 as conferring upon it
final powers to decide disputes other than those involving less than S
days suspension as mentioned in paragraph 10. This may be gleaned from
the fact that when confronted with the 4-point demands submitted by the
Union, the committee did not assume the authority to settle the dispute
once and for all but choose to make a recommendation to the management.
It is clear that only in specified cases (paragraph 10) does the
decision of the Labor Management Committee enjoy final and binding
effect upon the parties and that in all other cases the committee may
only make its recommendation to the management or employer who may
approve or disapprove the same. In the present case, therefore, the
nonapproval by the management of the committee's recommendation on the
union's 4-point demands was not a violation of the collective
bargaining agreement.</p>
<p> There is not much to the point raised by petitioner, that the
decision of the lower court was based merely on the report of the trial
examiner, for it is clearly stated in the decision that the
observations of the said court were based not only on the report
aforementioned but also on "all pleadings and evidence, oral or
documentary" presented by both parties. And the claim that the report
of the trial examiner was erroneous was not substantiated. There is
nothing in petitioner's arguments that would impute any distortion or
misrepresentation of facts on the part of the trial examiner.</p>
<p>Neither is there merit in the claim that there was irregularity in
the proceedings before the trial examiner due to the non-observance of
the procedure prescribed by sections 10 and 11 of Rule 34 of the Rules
of Court, that is, notice to the parties of the filing of the report of
a trial commissioner and the setting of such report for hearing. In
Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. <em>vs</em>. Philippine Labor Union, 71 Phil., 539, it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"When the Court of Industrial Relations refers a
case to a commissioner for investigation, report and recommendation,
and at such investigation the parties are duly represented by counsel,
heard or at least given an opportunity to be heard, the requirements of
due process has been satisfied, even if the Court failed to set the
report for hearing, and a decision on the basis of such report, with
the other evidence of the case, is a decision which meets the
requirements of a fair and open hearing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Premises considered, the decision and the order of the Court of
Industrial Relations must be, as they are hereby affirmed in all
respects. Without costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.</em>, and <em>Barrera, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
