				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an appeal from a judgment rendered&nbsp; by the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Davao dismissing the appellant's petition for mandamus&nbsp; (civil No. 103).<br><br>On 23 June 1956, Guillermo&nbsp; T. Garcia brought in the Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of the&nbsp; City of Davao a detainer action against Johnny Anthony and Crisostomo Paner to recover the possession&nbsp; of a house&nbsp; (civil&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2253).&nbsp; On 6&nbsp; July Apolonio Paner filed a motion praying that he be allowed to intervene, attaching thereto his answer in intervention.<br><br>On 19 July the Municipal Court&nbsp; denied his motion.&nbsp; Motion for reconsideration filed by&nbsp; him was&nbsp; denied on 27&nbsp; July. On 31 July&nbsp; Apolonio Paner filed in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Davao a&nbsp; petition for a writ to compel the Municipal Court to allow him to intervene in the&nbsp; detainer case.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 14 August&nbsp; respondent Garcia&nbsp; and on&nbsp; 17 August respondent Judge&nbsp; of the Municipal&nbsp; Court filed&nbsp; their answers.&nbsp; After hearing and after the petitioner had filed his&nbsp; memorandum,&nbsp; on 26&nbsp; September the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; rendered judgment&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; mandamus.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion for reconsideration which&nbsp; was denied on&nbsp; 6 October.&nbsp; The&nbsp; petitioner has appealed.<br><br>It appears that after judgment had become final and executory in civil case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1213 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Davao,&nbsp; Guillermo&nbsp; T.&nbsp;&nbsp; Garcia,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Benita B.&nbsp; Vda. de Mercado&nbsp; and Apolonio&nbsp; Paner et&nbsp; al., defendants, the Court&nbsp; issued a writ&nbsp; of execution;&nbsp; that pursuant thereto, the Sheriff of Davao levied upon execution and on 26&nbsp; April sold at public auction to Guillermo T. Garcia&nbsp; all&nbsp; interests,&nbsp; rights and&nbsp; title of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant in and to a house&nbsp; located at Tiongko Avenue, Davao City, erected on&nbsp; a parcel&nbsp; of&nbsp; land&nbsp; owned by Vicenta M.&nbsp; Vda. de&nbsp; Tiongko, subject&nbsp; to appellant's&nbsp; right of redemption within one&nbsp; year from the date of sale; that the appellant having failed to redeem the house&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; statutory period, the Sheriff of Davao executed&nbsp; and&nbsp; issued a certificate of&nbsp; absolute sale&nbsp; thereof in favor of Guillermo T. Garcia, the purchaser of the house at public auction; that on&nbsp; 23 June 1956, the&nbsp; latter brought in&nbsp; the Municipal Court of the City of&nbsp; Davao a&nbsp; detainer action&nbsp; against Johnny Anthony and Crisostomo Paner to recover possession of the house (civil No. 2253);&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant Apolonio Paner moved to&nbsp; intervene&nbsp; in the detainer&nbsp; case; and that in the appellant's answer in intervention attached to his motion&nbsp; for intervention,&nbsp; he&nbsp; impugns the&nbsp; validity of the execution sale&nbsp; for lack of notice to him and failure to comply&nbsp; with the rules of court,&nbsp; and alleges that&nbsp; he is still in possession of the house which&nbsp; is sought to be recovered by the&nbsp; purchaser at public&nbsp; auction Guillermo T. Garcia in the detainer case.<br><br>If the appellant Apolonio Paner be allowed to intervene in the detainer action by which the plaintiff, the purchaser of the house at public auction, seeks&nbsp; to recover it&nbsp; from the&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; Johnny&nbsp; Anthony and&nbsp; Crisostomo Paner, the appellant&nbsp; could raise questions&nbsp; tending&nbsp; to defeat the plaintiff's title to the house over which the Municipal Court has no jurisdiction.&nbsp; In view thereof, the Municipal Court was&nbsp; correct in not allowing the appellant to intervene&nbsp; in the detainer case.<br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs against the appellant.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
