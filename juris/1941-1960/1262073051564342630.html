				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petition for mandamus to compel Hon. Enrique A. Fernandez,&nbsp; Judge of Davao, to give due&nbsp; course to the appeal presented by herein petitioners&nbsp; in&nbsp; Special Civil Case No. 68 of his court of First Instance. The respondents say the appeal was filed out of time. That&nbsp; civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; commenced&nbsp; with an&nbsp; action&nbsp; by Felipe Deluao to modify the award&nbsp; of the Secretary of Agriculture ana Natural Resources&nbsp; in&nbsp; an administrative contest<br><br>between&nbsp; him&nbsp; and&nbsp; Supremo&nbsp; Deluao regarding&nbsp; fishponds under the control of the Bureau of Forestry, in the Municipality of Padada,&nbsp; Davao.&nbsp; The said Secretary approved. Felipe's fishpond application&nbsp; for&nbsp; Lot No.&nbsp; 3907 (area 38. hectares)&nbsp; and Supremo's fishpond application&nbsp; for Lot No. 3162&nbsp; (area 20&nbsp; hectares).&nbsp; Felipe&nbsp; Deluao&nbsp; claimed both. lots, for reasons not necessary to mention&nbsp; now. <br><br>After hearing the parties&nbsp; and their evidence,&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent judge&nbsp; rendered judgment for the plaintiff,&nbsp; declaring him to be the rightful applicant and possessor of both lots, and issuing other suitable directives. <br><br>Notice and copy&nbsp; of the decision was sent to Atty. Marfori representing the&nbsp; Solicitor General's&nbsp; Office who had appeared for the herein petitioners,&nbsp; had filed the answer and had attended the trial in September and October, 1955; such notice&nbsp; was received on March 27, 1956.&nbsp; The Clerk of Court&nbsp; likewise&nbsp; served notice&nbsp; of the decision on the Assistant Fiscal of Davao on&nbsp; April&nbsp; 11, 1956, because said Fiscal had also appeared in November 1955 for the same officials.&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 12, 1956,&nbsp; the latter filed&nbsp; a notice of appeal,&nbsp; which was objected to by Felipe Deluao,&nbsp; on the ground that it had been submitted beyond&nbsp; the&nbsp; period of appeal, counted from the receipt by Atty. Marfori of notice of the decision. <br><br>The&nbsp; fiscal replied to the&nbsp; objection; but the&nbsp; court found the appeal to be untimely, and turned it down. <br><br>It is contended in this petition that Atty. Marfori had previously withdrawn as counsel, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal became&nbsp; the&nbsp; sole counsel of petitioners&nbsp; and that consequently the time for appealing should be reckoned from: April 11,&nbsp; 1956. <br><br>This contention is premised on the following incidents, as related by the court itself: <br><blockquote>"On&nbsp; October 25, 1955, Atty.&nbsp; Marfori in open court made the following&nbsp; manifestation, which&nbsp; reads, as follows: <br><br>'Atty. Makfori: <br><br>I want to make it of record that if this court will ever postpone' the trial of this case, this representation might, not, be. able to come to this Court in view&nbsp; of the fact&nbsp; that the traveling; expenses for our Department has&nbsp; already&nbsp; been&nbsp; exhausted.&nbsp; In view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the importance of these&nbsp; records which are now here, I should like to request this Honorable Court to issue an order to the Department for the submission&nbsp; of&nbsp; these records&nbsp; to this&nbsp; Court in&nbsp; care of the&nbsp; Clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court, because this representation might not be&nbsp; able to come at the&nbsp; time this case will be&nbsp; transferred' .",&nbsp; </blockquote>"On November&nbsp; 5, 1955,&nbsp; the Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal received ¦the following communication&nbsp; which&nbsp; reads as follows: <br><blockquote>November 5, 1955 <br>The Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal Davao City <br>Sir: <br><br>This is to&nbsp; request your good office to represent the respondents Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources&nbsp; and the Director of Fisheries in&nbsp; Sp. Civil Case No. 63 (Felipe Deluao ve. Honorable Secretary of&nbsp; Agriculture and Natural Resources,&nbsp; et al.) now&nbsp; pending&nbsp; before the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Davao&nbsp; and set for&nbsp; hearing on November 25, 1955,&nbsp; in the sala of Judge Fernandez&nbsp; thereat. </blockquote>In this connection, tho District Fisheries Officer&nbsp; at&nbsp; Davao&nbsp; City, on even&nbsp; date,&nbsp; has&nbsp; been instructed&nbsp; to extend his cooperation to .your office on the matter,' "<br>&nbsp;<br>It is clear&nbsp; that&nbsp; there was no&nbsp; substitution.&nbsp; Apart from the fact that no proceedings for substitution of attorneys had taken place, the assistant fiscal herself<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> never claimed in the lower&nbsp; court that there&nbsp; had been&nbsp; such <i>substitution</i>.&nbsp; All she&nbsp; claimed was that the&nbsp; Fiscal's Office had actually appeared as&nbsp; counsel for respondents—not&nbsp; provisionally— and was entitled&nbsp; to notice, which was received only on April 11, 1956. <br><br>Under the Rules where a. party has two attorneys, notice to one of them is notice to&nbsp; such party.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Section 2&nbsp; Rule :27).&nbsp; "Wherefore the notice&nbsp; to&nbsp; Atty.&nbsp; Marfori on March 27, 1956 was notice to respondents, and the&nbsp; period for appealing—fifteen days<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup>—started from that&nbsp; date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> <br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; having been interposed on the sixteenth day,&nbsp; (March 27&nbsp; to April&nbsp; 12) it was late by one day—tardiness&nbsp; which has heretofore&nbsp; been declared sufficient to bar an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">4</sup> <br><br>In one case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">5</sup> it is true,&nbsp; we relaxed this rule because notice was&nbsp; given&nbsp; to&nbsp; an attorney&nbsp; who "appeared&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">provisionally</span> absence of the attorney who had entered his appearance&nbsp; in&nbsp; the case."&nbsp; And in another <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">6</sup> we found reasons not to apply the principle,&nbsp; because the notice had not been given to the <i>principal</i> attorney, who&nbsp; was considr ered as such by the <i>adverse party itself </i>and by the court. <br><br>However&nbsp; in this litigation no similar circumstances are brought to our attention to&nbsp; justify&nbsp; relaxation of the Rule. Indeed, if any attorney appeared provisionally or "in collaboration," it was probably&nbsp; the assistant&nbsp; fiscal of Davao, because the&nbsp; Fiscal would not have supplanted the Solicitor General's Office, which is supposed&nbsp; to be primarily the legal counsel of national officials and&nbsp; offices. <br><br>And&nbsp; if any&nbsp; equitable consideration is&nbsp; to be borne in mind, it is&nbsp; this: the&nbsp; party&nbsp; most directly affected&nbsp; by the court decision was&nbsp; Supremo&nbsp; Deluao&nbsp; who lost Lot No. 3162 to Felipe Deluao.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet he did not care to' appeal. <br><br>This&nbsp; petition&nbsp; should be, and it is&nbsp; hereby,&nbsp; denied. &nbsp;<br><br><i>No costs.
