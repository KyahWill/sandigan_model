				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal against&nbsp; a judgment&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Quezon finding Marcelo Alvarez,&nbsp; Alejandro Bordallo, Anacleto Prado, Aurelio Amulong&nbsp; and Federico de Vera,all guilty of murder of a detainee, Esteban Malaluan, and sentencing each and every one of them&nbsp; to <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> and all&nbsp; of&nbsp; them, jointly&nbsp; and severally, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P6,000.&nbsp; The appeal of Alejandro Bordallo has been&nbsp; withdrawn and that of Anacleto&nbsp; Prado dismissed for failure to file a brief.<br><br>It appears from the record that in the afternoon of November 29, 1951, a fight took&nbsp; place&nbsp; between two individuals&nbsp; at&nbsp; the railroad&nbsp; station&nbsp; at&nbsp; Barrio&nbsp; Katimo, Tagkawayan,&nbsp; Quezon.&nbsp; Appellant Aurelio Amulong, who was in the&nbsp; company of Sgt. Pauaan, intervened but he thrust his carbine at one of the combatants,. so Esteban Malaluan, assistant barrio lieutenant, who happened to be present, asked that he be allowed&nbsp; to&nbsp; settle the dispute between the&nbsp; combatants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amulong&nbsp; refused to recognize Malaluan's authority or his request and cocked his carbine,&nbsp; so Malaluan set aside the barrel,&nbsp; but Amulong elbowed him.&nbsp;&nbsp; One&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; Lopez&nbsp;&nbsp; intervened and' took away the carbine and gave it to Amulong's&nbsp; companion.<br><br>When Amulong and Pauaan returned to their&nbsp; camp at Tagkawayan,&nbsp; they reported the incident to Lt. Alejandro Bordallo, the detachment commander, so the latter ordered 6gts. Federico de Vera and Amulong to organize.a small force to bring in those who had participated in the disarming of Amulong.&nbsp; They did so, and&nbsp; proceeded the following&nbsp; day to Katimo and from&nbsp; there&nbsp; they took&nbsp; into custody the persons of Esteban Malaluan, Bernarditio Ana and Inocencio Inuval, bringing them to the army barracks at Tagkawayan.<br><br>Malaluan was taken to the office of Lt. Bordallo.&nbsp; Capt. Marcelo Alvarez happened to be there at that time.&nbsp; Sgts. de Vera, Prado and Amulong were also present.&nbsp; Malaluan was asked about the disarming incident at Katimo,&nbsp; and in the course of&nbsp; the investigation, Bordallo, de Vera, Prado and Amulong took turns in beating him giving him blows on the face,&nbsp; and on the&nbsp; stomach with the&nbsp; acquiescence of Capt. Alvarez.&nbsp; Malaluan claimed innocence and asked for&nbsp; their mercy but to no avail.&nbsp; Ana and&nbsp; Inobal, who were in a contiguous room, heard his shouts of pain,&nbsp; Lt. Bordello hit him on the face with the butt of his service pistol&nbsp; So hard was the beating that he received that he fell flat&nbsp; on the floor.&nbsp; At noon of the same day Malaluan' s wife brought him food to eat, but Malaluan refused to eat, saying he could not swallow because&nbsp; he felt pain in the neck and throat, and&nbsp; pains also in the chest and back. Malaluan&nbsp; told her&nbsp; that four had beaten him up, Bordallo, Amulong, Prado and de Vera.<br><br>&nbsp;That day Alvarez,&nbsp; Bordallo, de Vera and Amulong attended a luncheon. In the afternoon,&nbsp; they attended some games, in which Bordallo acted as starter&nbsp; at the races while de Vera and Amulong as&nbsp; guards.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; the&nbsp; evening they attended a&nbsp; dance at the school building.&nbsp; When&nbsp; at about midnight they came back to the barracks, Lt. Bordallo found that Malaluan was found dying at the stockade. Attempts to revive him by artificial respiration failed and Malaluan died.&nbsp; Capt. Alvarez ordered that he be placed in a cot and covered by a blanket.&nbsp; Then they improvised a&nbsp; coffin and&nbsp; placed&nbsp; him&nbsp; therein; then the&nbsp; corpse was brought in a truck and Malaluan was interred in&nbsp; a place outside the&nbsp; cemetery, without the benefit of any religious ceremony.<br><br>Alvarez had reported&nbsp; the&nbsp; death of Malaluan&nbsp; to the Justice of the Peace,&nbsp; who requested the President of the Sanitary Division at Tagkawayan to make an autopsy of the dead body. As Malaluan had already been buried, the corpse was&nbsp; exhumed.&nbsp; Upon&nbsp; examination&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; corpse, the President of the Sanitary&nbsp; Division made the following findings:<br><br>The body was&nbsp; in a state of partial decomposition, but still&nbsp; there <i>are</i> signs of discoloration of the&nbsp; skin at the head, face, neck, chest, abdomen,&nbsp; scrotum, both legs and at the back.&nbsp; While the body was rigid, the head&nbsp; could be easily bent in any direction.&nbsp; Both eyes were bulging and swollen; the&nbsp; nose depressed and the bones broken. The incissors of the upper jaw were detached from the gums and the upper maxilla was fractured in front.&nbsp; The tongue was swollen and protruding.&nbsp; Face and ears greatly swollen, liquefied blood coming from the ears.&nbsp; The cervical bones showed fracture, because the neck was soft, flabby, and the head could be easily bent in any direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Contusions were in the breast and abdomen.&nbsp; The testicle was swollen&nbsp; to the size of mango, with signs of contusion on each side.&nbsp; Both legs were dark in color, showing signs of extravation of blood&nbsp; in the tissues.<br><br>Signs showed use of blunt instruments on various parts of the body,&nbsp; like&nbsp; the nose, the&nbsp; mouth, and&nbsp; the fracture of the&nbsp; base&nbsp; of the&nbsp; skull.&nbsp; The blows that caused the fractures had caused the death of deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exh. "G"). In the&nbsp; lower court, the judge found that the accused had conspired to inflict the injuries that caused Malaluan's death, so he found all of them guilty.&nbsp; Only the appeals of Marcelo Alvarez, Aurelio Amulong and Federico de&nbsp; Vera need be considered as Alejandro Bordallo has withdrawn his appeal and that of Anacleto Prado dismissed for failure on his part or that of his counsel to file a brief and give satisfactory reasons for such failure.&nbsp; We will now consider,&nbsp; therefore, the&nbsp; appeals&nbsp; of Alvarez, Amulong and de Vera.<br><br>It is a&nbsp; fact that defendant-appellant Alvarez,&nbsp; who was the&nbsp; Commanding&nbsp; Officer&nbsp; of the unit stationed at&nbsp; Tagkawayan, with Lt.&nbsp; Bordallo&nbsp; as detachment commander, arrived at Tagkawayan and passed the night at the headquarters,&nbsp; supposedly&nbsp; on&nbsp; his way to Guinayangan; that in the morning of November 30,&nbsp; 1951, Lt. Bordallo reported to him that three civilians had been detained for questioning&nbsp; in&nbsp; relation to the&nbsp; disarming of Sgt. Amulong the day previous; that that same&nbsp; morning, evidently in&nbsp; pursuance of appellant's order to investigate, Bordallo, assisted by Sgts. de&nbsp; Vera and Prado&nbsp; beat Malaluan, giving him blows on the stomach and on his face, while Bordallo beat him on the mouth with the butt of his service pistol.<br><br>The&nbsp; defense&nbsp; of Capt. Alvarez argues (2nd assignment of error) that the trial court erred in holding that Alvarez conspired in the mauling of the deceased Malaluan.&nbsp; In the first place&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; Alvarez&nbsp; himself admitted&nbsp; that he gave Lt. Bordallo express order to&nbsp; further investigate Malaluan.&nbsp; As&nbsp; there was&nbsp; no question&nbsp; that Malaluan had disarmed Sgt. Amulong, the supposed order to investigate could have meant nothing more&nbsp; than&nbsp; that Malaluan be beaten&nbsp; to make him recognize his error and compel him (Malaluan)&nbsp; to&nbsp; respect the&nbsp; armed&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers.&nbsp; The investigators had called Malaluan a tough guy, of which fact Alvarez was informed.&nbsp; His order to investigate could be interpreted in no other light than that he (the tough guy) be punished for his&nbsp; arrogance.<br><br>Besides, Alvarez's order was to investigate Malaluan further, which shows he had investigated him already.&nbsp; To such effect is the testimony of Avelino Ripule&nbsp; (t.s.n. pp. 92-101) that while he&nbsp; (Ripule) was in the quarters of Lt.&nbsp; Bordallo at 10:00 in the morning, he saw the three civilians brought to the camp.&nbsp; Of these, two&nbsp; were&nbsp; sent away while one remained with Alvarez&nbsp; to be investigated. This was&nbsp; in the headquarters.&nbsp; As Alvarez&nbsp; investigated Malaluan,&nbsp; who&nbsp; was&nbsp; left because&nbsp; Inobal and Ana were sent out, Alvarez closed the door then called in Lt. Bordallo, who asked for the name of Malaluan.&nbsp; After that witness declared that Alvarez in an angry manner demanded&nbsp; why Malaluan&nbsp; grabbed the&nbsp; firearm of&nbsp; Sgt.&nbsp; Amulong.&nbsp; Malaluan's&nbsp; answer was&nbsp; not heard,&nbsp; but then witness&nbsp; heard that someone was struck and the&nbsp; one&nbsp; struck fell&nbsp; down, lying on the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; This witness&nbsp; also&nbsp; heard&nbsp; Alvarez ordering his soldiers to bring Malaluan. to the stockade.<br><br>Evidence was also&nbsp; submitted that at noon of that day (November 30)&nbsp; the wife of Malaluan came to bring&nbsp; him food and&nbsp; she saw and heard Malaluan say&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had been beaten&nbsp; and could&nbsp; not&nbsp; eat.&nbsp; The&nbsp; beating Malaluan had received must have been the cause of the swollen face and mouth&nbsp; and neck of Malaluan&nbsp; at&nbsp; noon.<br><br>Alvarez&nbsp; admits having&nbsp; directed Bordallo to&nbsp; continue with the investigation of Malaluan. That shows that he had already investigated Malaluan.&nbsp; Note, however, that the supposed investigation directed was not to elicit anything more than that Malaluan had disarmed Sgt. Amulong. Having ordered the&nbsp; investigation, Alvarez is certainly as guilty&nbsp; as the one who&nbsp; actually did investigate because he was the&nbsp; commanding officer, and according&nbsp; to Alvarez himself the practice of the army is "that once a case&nbsp; is submitted to the higher commander, the lower commander has&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; more&nbsp; to&nbsp; do&nbsp; with the&nbsp; case."&nbsp;&nbsp; (t.s.n. 11, Enriquez).<br><br>The&nbsp; conduct of Alvarez after he was told that Malaluan had died also&nbsp; discloses his guilty conscience.&nbsp; The following morning,&nbsp; he&nbsp; ordered that the corpse of Malaluan be wrapped, a coffin improvised, and taken near a&nbsp; cemetery there to be buried, without&nbsp; first&nbsp; giving&nbsp; opportunity to the Judge to&nbsp; conduct an inquest and it was&nbsp; only upon exhumation that the&nbsp; wounds causing his death were found. Again when the wife of Malaluan came to visit her husband and&nbsp; saw.that he (Malaluan)&nbsp; was not&nbsp; there&nbsp; any&nbsp; more, Alvarez&nbsp; pleaded&nbsp; with her not to&nbsp; file any complaint as she would be&nbsp; amply rewarded.<br><br>Counsel&nbsp; for Alvarez&nbsp; claims. that there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; proof of conspiracy. This claim is&nbsp; groundless.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alvarez himself had ordered those under him to continue&nbsp; the "investigation"&nbsp; and&nbsp; report&nbsp; their&nbsp; findings&nbsp; to&nbsp; him.&nbsp; The investigation was not a real investigation as usually meant or understood. It was&nbsp; rather an order to beat Malaluan in revenge&nbsp; for having&nbsp; attempted to wrest&nbsp; a&nbsp; soldier's firearm.&nbsp; This is the finding of the&nbsp; Army Investigator himself (Exhibit "7").<br><br>Appellant Amulong disclaims any participation&nbsp; in the manhandling, but he, among&nbsp; the soldiers, had the gravest cause or reason to complain against Malaluan.&nbsp; The wife of the deceased pointed to him as one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; four who did maltreat the deceased.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bernardino Ana, one of those detained with&nbsp; Malaluan,&nbsp; declared categorically that as soon as&nbsp; the three detainees were brought to&nbsp; the&nbsp; head-quarters just after their arrest, they&nbsp; were beaten up by Bordallo, de Vera and&nbsp; Amulong.&nbsp; Amulong himself beat up&nbsp; Malaluan (ts.n.&nbsp; pp. 122-123,&nbsp; Profugo).&nbsp; The&nbsp; effects of the beating were apparent at noon&nbsp; when Malaluan's wife brought him food and Malaluan said he&nbsp; could not eat because of&nbsp; the beating he&nbsp; had received at&nbsp; the hands of de Vera, Amulong and Bordallo.&nbsp; The above&nbsp; testimony of Ana as to the beating of Malaluan by&nbsp; Bordallo, de Vera and Amulong is corroborated&nbsp; by Marcelino Inobal, who declared that&nbsp; after&nbsp; the three&nbsp; had been brought&nbsp; to the Army camp, Malaluan was brought to&nbsp; a&nbsp; neighboring room where he was beaten up, having heard the shouts of pain that Malaluan&nbsp; made while being&nbsp; beaten,&nbsp;&nbsp; (t.s.n. p. 163, Profugo).<br><br>The participation&nbsp; Of appellant de&nbsp; Vera on&nbsp; the manhandling of Malaluan is proved by the&nbsp; same testimonies of detainees Ana and Inobal as well as&nbsp; by the&nbsp; testimony of Malaluan's wife.&nbsp; Witness Eduardo Araneta, who happened to be in the quarters of Lt.&nbsp; Bordallo at four o'clock in the afternoon, declared that&nbsp; Lt.&nbsp; Bordallo&nbsp; questioned Malaluan for about&nbsp; half an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bordallo hit him with the butt of his service pistol and Malaluan&nbsp; fell&nbsp; down and lost consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The soldiers, who&nbsp; assisted Bordallo in investigation were Prado and de Vera (t.s.n. pp. 145-146, Profugo).&nbsp;&nbsp; At the&nbsp; beginning of&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation according to Araneta&nbsp; the mouth of Malaluan was already swollen, thus corroborating the testimonies of Ana and Inobal that in the&nbsp; morning Malaluan had already&nbsp; been beaten by&nbsp; de&nbsp; Vera&nbsp; and Amulong.<br><br>The evidence on record,&nbsp; both oral and&nbsp; documentary, has been carefully&nbsp; studied and all&nbsp; together&nbsp; they produce the reasonable conviction that defendant-appellant Alvarez took part in the manhandling the deceased Malaluan and had directed his subordinates to continue with the&nbsp; said manhandling; that&nbsp; both defendants-appellants de&nbsp; Vera&nbsp; and Amulong have also participated directly&nbsp; in&nbsp; beating the deceased. The trial court also found them all guilty of manhandling the deceased and there is no reason for rejecting its finding&nbsp; in that respect.<br><br>We now come to consider the legal nature of the crime committed on the&nbsp; person of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased.&nbsp; It is clear that there was use&nbsp; of superior strength, not only because the officers used their weapons but&nbsp; the manhandling' and beating&nbsp; took&nbsp; place with the&nbsp; cooperation of Sergeants, specially de Vera, Prado, and Amulong.&nbsp; The deceased was alone, helpless, without means&nbsp; of defending himself.&nbsp; The qualifying circumstance of&nbsp; the use of superior strength must be&nbsp; considered as&nbsp; having attended&nbsp; the&nbsp; commission of the crime&nbsp; and raises it to murder.&nbsp; On the other hand we find&nbsp; no circumstances that may be considered for or. against the&nbsp; defendants-appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crime committed being murder, without any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the penalty to be imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua.</i> This penalty was imposed by the trial court.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from should be affirmed with costs against defendants-appellants.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.

Bordallo at 10:00&nbsp; in the morning, he saw the three civilians brought to the camp.&nbsp; Of those, two&nbsp; were sent&nbsp; away&nbsp; while one remained with Alvarez&nbsp; to&nbsp; be investigated.&nbsp; This was in the headquarters. As Alvarez investigated Malaluan, who was left because of Inobal and Ana were sent out, Alvarez closed the door then called in Lt. Bordallo, who asked for the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Malaluan.&nbsp; After that witness&nbsp; declared&nbsp; that Alvarez in an angry manner, demanded&nbsp; why Malaluan&nbsp; grabbed the firearm of Sgt.&nbsp; Amulong.&nbsp; Malaluan's&nbsp; answer&nbsp; was not heard,&nbsp; but then witness heard that someone was struck and&nbsp; the one struck&nbsp; fell down, lying on the floor.&nbsp; This witness also heard Alvarez ordering his soldiers to bring Malaluan to the stockade."<br></blockquote>But&nbsp; witness Avelino Ripule, whose&nbsp; testimony&nbsp; appears on the third&nbsp; volume&nbsp; of the transcript of stenographer Enriquez&nbsp; (pp. 92-98), was submitted by&nbsp; defendant-appellant Alejandro&nbsp; Bordallo.&nbsp; So that the aforecited testimony of said Ripule was inadvertently considered against defendant-appellant Alvarez when it should not have been so&nbsp; considered.<br><br>After discarding the testimony&nbsp; of&nbsp; Avelino. Ripule as against the defendant-appellant Alvarez, the question that presents itself is: After such elimination of direct evidence would the evidence still be&nbsp; sufficient to prove the guilt of Alvarez beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The participation of Alvarez may be briefly summarized as follows: As commanding officer&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; unit&nbsp; stationed&nbsp; at Tagkawayan, Alvarez passed the&nbsp; night&nbsp; at&nbsp; Tagkawayan&nbsp; in&nbsp; the headquarters; in the morning of November 30, 1951, Lt. Bordallo,&nbsp; detachment&nbsp; commander in the&nbsp; town, ordered the arrest and detention of three civilian&nbsp; for disarming Sgt. Amulong on&nbsp; the previous&nbsp; day;&nbsp; Alvarez ordered&nbsp; the investigation&nbsp; of Malaluan,&nbsp; one of&nbsp; the&nbsp; civilians,&nbsp; and by reason of such order Bordallo, with the assistance of De Vera and Prado, beat Malaluan,&nbsp; giving him blows on the stomach and the&nbsp; face while Bordallo beat&nbsp; him&nbsp; on the mouth with the barrel of his service pistol.<br><br>There is no question that Alvarez, as commander, had directed the investigation of Malaluan and his companions and that in pursuance of such order Bordallo and his non-commissioned officers beat Malaluan to such&nbsp; an extent that he&nbsp; afterwards died in consequence thereof.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, the legal question for us to resolve is: If by reason of the order of investigation which Alvarez gave, his subordinates beat the civilian to such an extent&nbsp; that he&nbsp; died, may Alvarez be held criminally responsible for the death of the said civilian?&nbsp;&nbsp; The order given by Alvarez was to investigate; but the officers went beyond merely questioning the civilian, by beating him&nbsp; severely as a result of which he&nbsp; died.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Revised Penal&nbsp; Code provides&nbsp; that a person may participate in&nbsp; the commission of&nbsp; a crime as principal, by direct participation or by provocation or cooperation.&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 17, Rev.&nbsp; Penal Code.)&nbsp; The acts of Alvarez&nbsp; were limited to&nbsp; ordering the&nbsp; investigation of civilian Malaluan; he seems to have meant that Malaluan should be subjected&nbsp; to some punishment for his insolence against and&nbsp; resistance to&nbsp; the&nbsp; police&nbsp; officers, but there is nothing beyond that;&nbsp; there&nbsp; is nothing to show that his, orders were&nbsp; to&nbsp; beat&nbsp; Malaluan to such an extent as to produce his&nbsp; death. In order that Alvarez&nbsp; may be considered as principal by induction, it&nbsp; would be necessary for the&nbsp; prosecution to prove that he actually directed, whether directly or indirectly,&nbsp; the beating of Malaluan, which evidence does not exist in the case at bar.<br><br>Under the&nbsp; circumstances already indicated, namely, that the testimony of Avelino Ripule should not be&nbsp; taken into account against defendant-appellant Alvarez and that the order&nbsp; of Alvarez&nbsp; was limited to the investigation of Malaluan without a clear direction that he be beaten, we are forced to agree with the conclusion of the&nbsp; Solicitor General&nbsp; that the participation&nbsp; of defendant Alvarez in the killing of Malaluan has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision should&nbsp; be reconsidered&nbsp; and defendant-appellant Marcelo Alvarez is hereby, as he should be, acquitted,&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; costs&nbsp; chargeable against&nbsp; him proportionately <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
