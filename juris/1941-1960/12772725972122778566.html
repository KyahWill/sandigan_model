				<BR><BR><p>Certiorari to annul an order issued by the Fifth Division of the People's 
Court cancelling the bail filed by petitioner for his provisional liberty and 
ordering the arrest of the latter</p>
<p>Petitioner, a political detainee, was, on September 15, 1945, released on a 
bail of P20,000 granted by the Solicitor General, pursuant to the authority 
vested in the latter by the provisions of Executive Order No. 65 (41 Off. Gaz., 
p. 416).</p>
<p>On February 5, 1946, the Office of Special Prosecutors filed in the People's 
Court an indictment on twelve counts charging petitioner with the high crime of 
treason. Simultaneously, the office of Special Prosecutors filed in the same 
court a petition for the cancellation of petitioner's bail, planted upon the 
ground that the evidence of guilt then in their possession was strong.</p>
<p>The foregoing petition was heard on March 2 and 11, 1946, before the 
Honorable Jose P. Veluz, one of the Judges of the Fifth Division of the People's 
Court. In the course of the hearing, the Special Prosecutor recited what he 
terms "a few of the summary of the evidence in the hands of the prosecution in 
support of the counts of treason alleged in the information against the 
accused," taken from the affidavits of witnesses. No further evidence was 
introduced by the prosecution. Counsel for petitioner objected to the competency 
and sufficiency of the recital made by the Special Prosecutor. He invoked the 
right to cross-examine the witnesses for the prosecution. Counsel moved for a 
ruling on his objection, without prejudice to petitioner's right to present 
evidence on his behalf. <br>Judge Veluz overruled the objection upon the ground 
that the Special Prosecutor declined to reveal his evidence and had expressed 
his desire to present the the witnesses for the prosecution only at the trial of 
the case. Petitioner then presented two witnesses, namely, Dalmacio Maniquis and 
Major Fernando Perello of the Philippine Army. The subatance of their testimony 
is ttiat the accused had knowledge of the guerrilla activities of these two 
witnesses and helped the latter. Said witnesses, however, had no knowledge of 
the charges<br>against the petitioner.</p>
<p>Predicated upon the ground that the evidence which sustains the acts charged 
in the information against the accused is strong "according to the recital made 
on the record by the Special Prosecutor", and that said evidence was not 
rebutted or strengthened by the testimony of the witnesses presented by the 
defense, the respondent Judges, in an order dated March 14, 1946, ordered the 
cancellation of the bail and the arrest of petitioner.</p>
<p>A motion for reconsideration having been denied by the respondent Judges in 
an order dated April 13, 1946, petitioner brought the case before this court on 
certiorari. It is urged, <em>first</em>, that the respondent Judge Honorable 
Jose P. Veluz, sitting alone, was without authority to hear the petition for the 
cancellation of the bail; and <em>secondly</em>, that the respondent Judges of 
the People's Court committed a grave abuse of discretion in ordering the 
cancellation of the bail without a showing, on the part of the prosecution, of 
competent and strong evidence of guilt.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The question as to the number of Judges required to be present in order to 
authorize the legal transaction of business by the People's Court is to be 
determined from the law of its creation. The general rule is that the death, 
disqualification, resignation, or absence of a Judge "will not deprive the 
surviving or remaining Judges of authority to hold court and transact the 
business of the court * * * provided, however, the number of the court is not 
reduced below that legally required for the transaction of its business" (14 Am. 
Jur. 282-283). By Section 6 of the People's Court Act, the said court may sit in 
five divisions of three judges each. Section 9 of the same Act provides that two 
judges shall constitute a <em>quorum</em> "for the sessions in division", and 
added that: "In the absence of a <em>quorum</em>, the * * * division shall stand 
<em>ipso facto</em> adjourned until such time as the requisite number shall be 
present, and a memorandum to this effect shall be inserted by the clerk in the 
minutes of the court." In the absence of a <em>quorum </em>owing to the legal 
disqualification of a Judge, Section 7 of the law directs that the president 
shall designate a District Judge of First Instance, Judge-at-Large of First 
Instance, Cadastral Judge, Judge of the Court of Industrial Relations, 
Securities and Exchange Commissioner, or Public Service Commissioner "to sit and 
vote" in lieu of the disqualified Judge, in connection with the case which 
brought about the disqualification. Section 12 enjoins the People's Court to try 
and decide or otherwise dispose of its cases in the manner provided for in the 
Act and in existing laws not inconsistent therewith.</p>
<p>A circumspect and considerate examination of the foregoing provisions of the 
People's Court Act discloses that Congress made it abundantly clear that in the 
absence of a <em>quorum</em>, a division of the People's Court must suspend its 
sessions, and it shall stand <em>ipso facto</em>, adjourned until such time as 
the requisite number shall be present. The statutory requirement of a 
<em>quorum</em> for the sessions in division is mandatory. The phraseology of 
the law is clear. There is no room for doubt. Short of the presence of two 
Judges, a division of the People's Court has no authority to sit for the 
transaction of business; it has no power to hear a petition for the cancellation 
of bail. Consequently, the respondent Judge Honorable Jose P. Veluz, sitting 
alone, was without authority to hear the application for the cancellation of 
petitioner's bail.</p>
<p>The mere fact that the order directing the cancellation of the bail was 
subsequently signed by the three respondent judges constituting the Fifth 
Division of the People's Court, is of no moment. The mandatory requirement of a 
<em>quorum</em> in the People's Court Act cannot be detoured by the simple 
expedient of permitting one of the judges of a division to hold sessions and 
thereafter submit the case for the consideration of the members of that 
division. A man's liberty is so precious as to be treated so lightly. In this 
particular case, petitioner received less than a fair hearing. For, under the 
law, he was entitled to a resolution handed down at the hearing by at least two 
of the Judges of the Fifth Division, sitting in court, upon a question of 
substance, namely, his objection to the competency and sufficiency of the 
recital of the evidence made by the special Prosecutor.</p>
<p>Upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion and so hold that the proceedings 
had before the respondent Judge Honorable Jose P. Veluz on the matter of the 
petition for the cancellation of the bail herein, are null and void.</p>
</li><li>Constitutional law has established the basic rule that all persons shall 
before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties, except those charged with 
capital "offenses when evidence of guilt is strong (section 1 [16], Article III 
of the constitution; Ocampo <em>vs</em>. Hon. Jose Bernabe, p.55, 
<em>ante</em>). It is now well-settled that at the hearing of an application for 
the cancellation of ball in a capital offense, the burden of proof is on the 
prosecution (Marcos <em>vs. </em>Cruz, 67 Phil., 82; Ocampo <em>vs.</em> 
Bernabe, <em>supra</em>). And, in Ocampo<em> vs. </em>Bernabe, <em>supra</em>, 
this court said;</li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The determination of whether or not the evidence of guilt is strong 
is, as stated in the Herras Teehankee case, a matter of judicial discretion. 
This discretion, by the very nature of things, may rightly be exercised only 
after the evidence is submitted to the court at the hearing. Since the 
discretion is directed to the weight of evidence and since evidence cannot 
properly be weighed if not duly exhibited or produced before the court (Ramos 
<em>vs.</em> Ramos, 45 Phil. 362), it is obvious that a proper exercise of 
judicial discretion requires that the evidence of guilt be submitted to the 
court the petitioner having the right of cross-examination and to introduce his 
own evidence in rebuttal. * * *" </p></blockquote>
<p>In the present case, the charge against petitioner is a capital, offense, 
namely, treason. Therefore, for the petition to cancel his bail to prosper, the 
prosecution must present strong evidence of guilt. No evidence, however, was 
adduced by the Special Prosecutor at the hearing of the application to cancel 
the bail. It is true that the Special Prosecutor made a recital in the form of a 
summary of a portion of the evidence in the hands of the prosecution in support 
of the counts of treason against respondent, taken from the affidavits of 
witnesses. But this recital was objected to by the defense. And, as was 
correctly stated in Ocampo <i>vs.</i> Bernabe, 
<i>supra</i>, the rule is that "mere affidavits or recital of their 
contents are not sufficient since they are hearsay evidence, unless the 
petitioner fails to object". Really, if the rule were otherwise, a Special 
Prosecutor would be virtually clothed with the power of an arbiter on the 
question of determining whether or not a person accused of treason is entitled 
to bail. This would amount to an abdication of the court's prerogatives. Such is 
not the law.</p>
<p>It appearing that no evidence was presented in support of the motion for the 
cancellation of the bail, the respondent Judges of the Fifth Division of the 
People's Court committed an abuse of discretion in ordering the cancellation of 
petitioner's bail and the arrest of the<br>latter.</p>
<p>But the People's Court order in question had heretofore produced its effects. 
It was executed. The bail in effect was cancelled, and petitioner was arrested 
and now is in the custody of the law. We are faced by a <em>fait accompli</em>. 
From the moment petitioner was arrested upon cancellation of his bail, his 
surety ceased to be his mancupator-his jailer, was deprived of control over and 
custody of petitioner, and was thus effectively prevented from discharging its 
legal obligations (section 2, Rule 110, Rules of Court) under the undertaking. 
Consequently, the surety was discharged and the bail bond ceased to be in force. 
Said bail bond is beyond recall. Reversal of the executed order of cancellation 
and arrest will not revive it. Our duty in the premises is plain. It is to 
restore petitioner to his <em>status quo ante</em> as far as is possible, 
petitioner, accordingly, is entitled to be released upon the filing and approval 
by the People's Court, of a new ball bond in the same amount as the original 
bond, that is, P20,000.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order of the respondent judges dated March 14, 1946, directing 
the cancellation of bail and the arrest of petitioner, and the order of the said 
Judges dated April 13, 1946, denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration are 
hereby set aside; and the People's Court is hereby ordered to admit petitioner 
to a new bail in the sum of P20,000, without prejudice to the right of the 
Office of Special Prosecutors thereafter to petition the People's Court for the 
cancellation of said bail, which petition shall be heard and decided in 
accordance with the opinion herein. Without costs.</p>
<p><em>Feria, Pablo, Hilado, JJ., and De la Rosa, Santos, Angeles, Ramos, 
</em>and <em>Benitez, Acting JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<p><strong>FERIA, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I hereby certify that Acting Associate Justice Nicasio Yatco voted in 
accordance with this decision, but could not sign the same because of his being 
assigned in Sta. Cruz, Laguna.</p>
<p>PERFECTO, J., concurring and dissenting:</p>
<p>We concur in the majority opinion in so far as it reiterates the principles 
and doctrines which we have enunciated in our dissenting or concurring opinions 
in Duran vs. Abad Santos, (42 Off. Gaz., 263, 1945), in Herras Teehankee 
<em>vs</em> Rovira, (75 Phil., 634), in Teehankee <em>vs</em>. Director of 
Prisons, (76 Phil., 756), and in Ocampo <em>vs</em>. Bernabe, (p.55, 
<em>ante</em>).</p>
<p>We also fully agree with the pronouncement that the proceedings had before 
one of the respondent judges without the presence of at least another one, are 
null and void, being in violation of the People's Court let which provides that 
two judges shall constitute a <em>quorum</em> for the sessions in division of 
the People's Court and that, in the absence of a <em>quorum</em>, the division 
shall stand <em>ipso facto</em> adjourned until such time as the requisite 
number shall be present.</p>
<p>But, as in De la Rama <em>vs</em>. Misa, (42 Off. Gaz., 1544), in Ocampo 
<em>vs</em>. Bernabe, supra, and lastly in De la Rama <em>vs</em>. People's 
Court (p. 461, <em>ante</em>), we are compelled to dissent from the dispositive 
part of the majority opinion in the present case as being inconsistent with the 
legal principles and doctrines enunciated as, premises in the body of the 
majority opinion.</p>
<p>We are of opinion that petitioner Procopio Beltran is entitled to immediate 
release, without the necessity of posting any new bond, as his bond in the 
amount of P20,000, posted on September 15, 1945, must be considered surviving 
and continued by the decision setting aside the order of respondent judges dated 
March 14, 1946, ordering the cancellation of the bail and the arrest of the 
petitioner, and the one dated April 13, 1946, denying petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration.</p>
<p>The orders of March 14 and April 13, 1946, being null and void as having been 
issued in violation of law and with grave abuse of discretion, must be, for all 
legal purposes, considered as if they had not been issued at all and, therefore, 
they have not the effect of cancelling the bail of petitioner. It is, besides, 
highly unjust to compel petitioner to support the heavy expenses entailed in 
posting a new bond in the amount of P20,000.</p>
<p>If logic and consistency have any meaning, the annulment of the two orders 
complained of must restore petitioner to the legal status which was illegally 
disturbed by the two illegal orders. Petitioner must be set free and given 
freedom on the bail bond posted on September 15, 1945.</p>
<p>To require petitioner to file a new bond in the amount of P20,000, which must 
be submitted to the approval of the People's Court, and to reserve to the Office 
of Special Prosecutors the right or privilege "to petition the People's Court 
for the cancellation of said bail," seems to us not only contrary to all 
elements of consistency, but tends to make of judicial procedure not as a means 
of settling rights and ending litigations, but as a sort of cloth of Penelope or 
a jigsaw puzzle which Is made and broken, remade and again broken, until the 
player gets tired or exhausted.</p>
<p>We vote to order the immediate release of petitioner on his bail bond posted 
on September 15, 1945, without the necessity of filing another one.</p>
