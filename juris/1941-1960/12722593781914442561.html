				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner was one of the candidates for councilor of the 
municipality of Makati, Province of Rizal, in the elections held on 
November 13, 1951. There were eight councilors to be elected and as a 
result of the canvass made by the board of canvassers on November 
18,1951, petitioner occupied the eighth place and was proclaimed 
elected, having obtained 3,160 votes. On April 12, 1952, or four months 
and twenty-four days after petitioner's proclamation, Fortunato 
Gutierrez, hereafter designated as respondent, filed a petition in the 
Commission on Elections alleging that due to a mistake in addition the 
municipal board of canvassers credited petitioner with 3,160 votes when 
in fact he obtained only 3,060 votes, whereas respondent obtained 3,098 
votes, or a majority of 38 votes over petitioner. Respondent prayed that
 the municipal board of canvassers be ordered to make a new canvass and a
 new proclamation declaring him the eighth councilor-elect in lieu of 
petitioner.
<p> On May 26, 1952, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss alleging among
 other things that the Commission on Elections has no power to order the
 correction asked for on the ground that the period within which it 
could be made has already prescribed. This motion was denied and the 
Commission directed the municipal board of canvassers to reconvene and 
recanvass the election returns as prayed for, and, having found that 
respondent had polled more votes than petitioner, proclaimed the former 
eighth councilor-elect of Makati.</p>
<p> The present petition, as amended, seeks the annulment of this 
proclamation as illegal and the reinstatement of petitioner to the 
office of eighth councilor of Makati. And, incidentally, it may be 
stated, that petitioner has, in addition, filed in the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal an election protest dated June 2, 1952, contesting the
 election of respondent.</p>
<p> The only question posed in this petition is whether the Commission 
on Elections has the power to order the municipal board of canvassers of
 Makati to correct a mistake committed in addition in the canvass it has
 made after the candidate erroneously proclaimed had assumed office and 
the period to contest his election had expired.</p>
<p> The powers of the Commission on Elections are defined in the 
Constitution. It provides that it "shall have exclusive charge of the 
enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the conduct of 
elections and shall exercise all other functions which may be conferred 
upon it by law. It shall decide, save those involving the right to vote,
 all administrative questions, affecting elections, including the 
determination of the number and location of polling places, and the 
appointment of election inspectors and of other election officials." 
(Art. X, Section 2.) The Revised Election Code supplements what other 
powers may be exercised by said Commission. It is clear that powers not 
expressly or impliedly granted to it are deemed withheld.</p>
<p> In a municipal election, the board of inspectors counts the votes, 
makes a statement of the count, proclaims the result of the election, 
and issues a certificate of the number of votes polled by each 
candidate. After the announcement of the result, the board of inspectors
 "shall not make any alteration or amendment in any of its statements, 
unless it be so ordered by a competent court" (Section 154, Revised 
Election Code).</p>
<p> The municipal board of canvassers shall meet immediately after the 
election, shall count the votes cast for each candidate and proclaim as 
elected those who have polled the largest number of votes. The board 
shall not recount the ballots nor examine any of them but shall proceed 
upon the statements presented to it. In case of contradictions or 
discrepancies between the copies of the same statements, the same may be
 corrected by the Court of <em>First Instance of the province</em>, upon
 motion of the board or of any candidate affected. (Section 168, in 
connection with Section 163, Revised Election Code.)</p>
<p> The above constitute the only pertinent provisions regarding the 
canvass and proclamation of municipal officials. They clearly postulate 
that any alteration or amendment in any of the statements of election, 
or any contradiction or discrepancy appearing therein, whether due to 
clerical" error or otherwise, cannot be made without the intervention of
 a competent court, once the announcement of the result of the election,
 or the proclamation of the winners, had been made. These provisions are
 all-inclusive in the sense that the power to authorize the correction 
can only be made by a competent court. They reject the idea, as now 
entertained by respondent, that such error can be ordered corrected by 
the Commission on Elections by virtue of its constitutional power to 
administer the laws relative to the conduct of elections.</p>
<p> That the above is the correct interpretation of the law seems to be 
implied from the cases decided by this Court (Galvez <em>vs.</em> 
Miranda, et al., 36 Phil., 316, 320; Cordero <em>vs.</em> Judge, 40 
Phil., 246). Thus, it was held that "when it appears that the board of 
canvassers has failed or refused to perform a purely ministerial duty, 
then <em>mandamus</em> is the proper remedy. If the board of canvassers 
should, for example in its return, show that A had received a majority 
of the votes cast and, in the face of that fact, declare that B had been
 elected, certainly it should be required to make its certificate 
conform with the facts stated in its return. Under such circumstances, 
and in the face of such facts, A cannot be considered the person elected
 to the office in question. <em>Mandamus</em> is the most effective and 
expeditious remedy for such error." (Municipal Council of Las Piñas<em> vs.</em>
 Judge of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, 40 Phil., 279, 282-284.)</p>
<p> But in order that the remedy of <em>mandamus</em> may be available, 
it is necessary that it be asserted within the two-week period within 
which an election may be contested. After that period has elapsed, the 
right of the candidate proclaimed to the office is deemed vested. The 
reason is obvious. This period is jurisdictional, as it has the effect 
of divesting a losing candidate of his remedy to contest the election. 
This is what this Court in effect said when in a recent case it made the
 following pronouncement:</p>
<p>"Before the proclamation of election, any candidate may petition the 
Court of First Instance to recount the votes cast in any precinct in 
case of discrepancies between copies of statements of election (Sections
 163 and 168, Revised Election Code). After the proclamation, any 
candidate may file an election protest within two weeks (Section 174, 
idem.). These specific legal provisions logically compel any candidate, 
within short time limits, to seek in the Court of First Instance the 
corresponding relief against the regularity of a canvass of election, 
and to the same extent relieve the Commission on Elections from the duty
 of conducting similar investigations.' (Ramos <em>vs.</em> Commission 
on Elections,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[*]</sup></span> 45 Off. Gaz., 
Supp. No. 9, 345, 347.)</p>
<p> The theory entertained by the respondent tends to circumvent this 
mandatory provision which limits the period within which an election 
contest should be filed. This is the result which the action of the 
Commission on Elections has led into in the present case. It appears 
that Isidro de Leon, petitioner herein, was proclaimed councilor-elect 
by the municipal board of canvassers on November 18, 1951, but four 
months and twenty-four days thereafter, or on April 12, 1952, the 
defeated candidate, Fortunato Gutierrez, petitioned the Commission on 
Elections to order said board to make a recanvass of the votes alleging a
 clerical mistake, and this was done on May 31, 1952, thereby 
proclaiming Fortunato Gutierrez as the winner. The result was that 
Isidro de Leon filed an election protest within the legal period counted
 from the last proclamation disputing the legality of the election of 
Gutierrez. If we will hold that the Commission on Elections has acted 
properly, as entertained by the respondent, the inevitable result would 
be that the election contest was filed within the statutory period. This
 is a clear circumvention of the law which is destructive of the very 
essence and spirit which underlies the summary nature of an election 
proceeding while it sets a precedent which enlarges to a dangerous 
extreme the, administrative powers conferred upon the Commission on 
Elections by the Constitution. We cannot subscribe to such unwarranted 
interpretation.</p>
<p> Wherefore, the petition for certiorari is granted, with costs 
against respondent. The new proclamation made on May 31,1952 is hereby 
set aside and the original proclamation made on November 18, 1951 should
 stand.</p>

<h3 align="center">  <strong>CONCURRENTE</strong>  </h3>
<p><strong>DIOKNO, M.:</strong></p>
<p> Concurro con la opinion de que se conceda el remedio aqui 
solicitado.</p>
<p> Los hechos y la cuestion en este asunto se hallan bien expuestos en 
la ponencia en los siguientes terminos:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "This is a petition for certiorari.</p>
  <p> "The facts are not in dispute. Isidro de Leon and Fortunato 
Gutierrez were among the candidates for municipal councilors of Makati, 
Rizal, voted for in the election held on November 13, 1951. There were 8
 councilors to be elected, and on the basis of the votes shown in the 
election returns from the different precincts Gutierrez had occupied 8th
 place with a total of 3,098 votes in his favor as against 3,060 votes 
in favor of De Leon, his closest contender for that place. But due to a 
mistake in addition, the municipal board of canvassers, which met on 
November 18, 1061, to canvass the returns, credited De Leon with 3,160 
votes and proclaimed him the elected 8th councilor of the municipality.</p>
  <p> "Informed, of the error committed by the municipal board of 
canvassers, Gutierrez on April 12, 1952, petitioned the Commission on 
Elections to annul the proclamation of De Leon and order the board to 
make a new canvass. De Leon opposed the petition. But the Commission, 
after hearing, granted the petition, annulled the proclamation in favor 
of De Leon and directed the board to reconvene and recanvass the votes 
received by these two candidates and proclaim the one that came out 
winner according to the result.</p>
  <p> "Proceeding as directed by the Commission, the municipal board of 
'canvassers reconvened on May 31, 1952, to recanvass the election 
returns and, having found that Gutierrez had polled more votes than De 
Leon, proclaimed the former elected 8th councilor of Makati.</p>
  <p>"The present petition, as amended, seeks the annulment of this 
proclamation as illegal and the restoration of petitioner to the office 
of 8th councilor of Makati. But it appears that petitioner has, in 
addition, filed in the Court of First Instance of Rizal an election 
protest, dated June 2, 1952, contesting the election of Gutierrez.</p>
  <p> "It is admitted that the municipal board of canvassers had made a 
mistake in adding up the votes reported in the election returns and that
 due to this mistake in addition De Leon was proclaimed elected.  The 
question presented is whether a mistake of that kind may be ordered 
corrected by the Commission on Elections after the candidate erroneously
 proclaimed has already assumed office.'' (Decision original, No. 
L-5758, pp. 1-2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Las facultades de la Comision de Elecciones se definen en ei 
Articulo X, seccion 2, de la Constitution cpmo sigue:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 2. The Commission on Elections shall have exclusive charge 
of the, enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the 
conduct .of elections and shall exercise all other functions which may 
be conferred upon it by law. It shall decide, save those involving the 
right to vote, all administrative questions, affecting elections, 
including the determination of the number and location of polling 
places, and the appointment of election inspectors and of other election
 officials. * * * The decisions, orders, and rulings of the Commission 
shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> El administrar y hacer cumplir las leyes relativas a la celebracipn 
de las elecciones y el decidir las cuestipnes administrativas que 
afectan a las elecciones que no envuelvan el dereeho de votar suppnen 
estistencia de tales leyes y respeto y reverencia a las mismas. No hace 
de la Comision, solo por haber sido elevada al rango de cuerpo 
constitutional, superior a dichas leyes.</p>
<p> En materia de escrutinio electoral, la Comision deberia desplegar 
todo su ingenio y tener una maquinaria tan completa como los fondos a su
 disposition permitan, para asegurar que las diferentes juntas al efecto
 cumplan puntual y fielmente con sus deberes, y para prevenir sobre la 
marcha todo posible error, irregularidad o fraude en las proclamaciones.
 No es su funcion sentarse como jueces y esperar que los otros 
interesados acudan a ella en demanda de remedio. Es funcion activa 
durante la celebration de las eleciones la que la Constitution ha 
encomendado a la Comision. Por su parte, los partidos y los candidates 
deberian ejercer la maxima vigilancia, y llamar oportunamente la 
atention de cuantas autoridades intervienen o deben intervenir en la 
ejecucion de las leyes electorates para evitar que ocurran retrasos, a 
se cometan o consuman errores, irregularidades o fraudes. En el caso de 
estos autos, el alegado error de suma de votos se hubiera advertido y 
evitado inmediatamente si el afectado hubiera sido un poco vigilante, o 
su partido hubiere designado un interventor despierto en la junta de 
escrutinio como provee el articulo 168, en relation con el articulo 159,
 del Codigo Electoral Revisado. Tambien se hubiera podido evitar si un 
representante de la Comision en el municipio hubiera atendido el 
escrutinio municipal.</p>
<p> Despues de hecha la proclamation, nuevos factores entran en juego 
que no pueden desconocerse. La Junta no puede, <em>motu propio</em> 
reunirse y corregir el acta de proclamation del resultado de la 
election, como no sean meros errores clericales u otros de analogo 
caracter, sin orden judicial. Galvez <em>vs.</em> Miranda, 36 Phil., 
316, 320. Como esta Corte dijo en el caso de Cordero <em>contra</em> 
Juez de Primera Instancia de Rizal (1919) 40 Jur. Fil., 261, 266, 267:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Los recurridos pretenden que la Junta Municipal de Escmtinio 
carecia de facultades para recontar las papeletas y hacer enmiendas en 
su primitive. proclamacion. El articulo 477 de la Ley No. 2711,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> dispone que inmediatamente despues,
 de la election, el Concejo Municipal se reunird en sesion especial, y 
procedera a actuar como Junta Municipal de Escrutinio; y contara los 
votos emitidos para cada uno de los cargos municipales en la misma forma
 que se dispone en el Articulo 469, para la Junta Provincial de 
Escrutinio. Dicho articulo (477) dispone, ademas, que la Junta Municipal
 de Escrutinio no tendra la facultad de recontar los votos ni die 
inspeccionarlos, sino que procedera con vista de las actas, tal como se 
hayan corregido, si es que ha habido necesidad de correcciones. La 
resolucion de dicha Junta se hard constar por escrito en triplicado<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> firmado por los que la componen o 
por la mayoria de ellos. Cuando se hayan cumplido los deberes de tal 
suerte impuestos a la Junta Municipal de Escrutinio, y esta extiende su 
certificado conforme exige la Ley, su tarea, como tal junta, ha 
terminado, y no se dispone nada sobre su continuation como junta de 
escrutinio * * *"</p>
  <p> "El objeto de la ley es dar fin de modo definitivo, por lo que a 
la Junta Municipal de Escrutinio afecta, al escrutinio de los votos que 
se han emitido para cada uno de los cargos municipales. Aunque la Junta 
Municipal de Escrutinio se compone de los que constituyen el Concejo 
Municipal, no actuan como concejales, sino como una entidad distinta y 
diferenteraente organizada para un fin expreso, y cuando dicho objetivo 
queda cumplido, desaparece y termina su existencia como tal Junta de 
Escrutinio. "Por tanto, la Junta Municipal de Escrutinio carecia de 
facultades para volver a practicar el recuento y hacer nueva 
proclamacion, sin haber sido autorizada para ello por una orden del 
Juzgado, de conformidad con Io que dispone el articulo 479 de la Ley No.
 2711."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Cuando el error importante se debe a que la Junta de Escrutinio no 
ha tenido en cuenta actas electorales de otros precintos, o que ha 
tornado ntimeros de votos distintos de los que constan en las actas 
electorales, se le puede obligar mediante <em>mandamus</em> a que 
complete el escrutinio o tenga en cuenta las cifras verdaderas y haga 
nueva proclamacion conforme a lo resuelto de las actas legitimas.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Que procede la expedicion de un <em>mandamus</em> para obligar a 
la Junta de Escrutinio que declare en su certificado el resultado del 
escrutinio, es doctrina perfectamente sentada ahora, sobre todo, cuando 
resulte, con vista de las actas, que el certificado no se sjusta a los 
hechos que en ellas constan. Esta apoyada por abundante jurisprudencia 
la doctrina de que, cuando la Junta de Escrutinio se negare a contar 
cualquiera de los votos, podra obligarsela, mediante <em>mandamus</em>, a
 que los cuente. En principio no ouede haber diferencia entre negarse a 
contar cualquiera de los votos o negarse a contar solo parte del 
resultado. El <em>mandamus</em> es el recurso adecuado para obligar a 
una junta municipal de escrutinio para que corrija su certificado, de 
conformidad con sus propias actas. (15 Cyc, 383; People <em>vs.</em> 
Nordham, 90 111. 553; State <em>vs.</em> Hardin County Judge, 13 Iowa, 
139; Rich <em>vs.</em> Bogard State Canvassers, 100 Mich., 453; People <em>vs.</em>
 Onondaga County, 129 N. W., 335.)</p>
  <p> "Aunque no procedera el <em>mandamus</em> para obligar a que se 
declara que un individuo tiene derecho a un cargo discutido, o para 
determinar cuestiones discutidas relativas al derecho al cargo, es el 
recurso adecuado en casos en que los funcionarios de eleccion dejen de 
cumplir con sus deberes ministeriales, en relation con la eleccion. 
Procedera el <em>mandamus</em> para obligar a la Junta de Escrutinio a 
que redacte y complete actas exactas. (Steward <em>vs.</em> Payton, 77 
Ga., 668; McCreary sobre Elecciones, pag. 301; Paine sobre Elecciones, 
pags. 755, 756.)</p>
  <p> Hasta que la Junta de Escrutinio haya complido con el preciso 
deber que la ley Ie impone, debe considerarsela contumaz, y, en un caso 
como este, seria una anomalia legal pennitir que la Junta se atuviera al
 hecho de que habla librado un certificado de eleccion a uno que no 
habia recibido el mayor numero de votos, en <em>contra</em> de lo que 
expresamente dispone la ley, como razon bastante para que no se le 
obligue a cumplir un deber imperativo. (pp. 300-301.)</p>
  <p> * * * Cuando resulta que la Junta de Escrutinio ha dejado de 
cumplir, o se ha negado a cumplir un deber puramente ministerial, 
cntonces el <em>mandamus</em> es el recurso adecuado. Si, por ejemplo, 
la Junta de Escrutinio hubiera hecho constar en su acta que A recibio la
 mayoria de los votos emitidos, y en vista de tal hecho declarara que B 
habia sido elegido, ciertamente que se le debe exigir que redacte su 
certificado con arreglo a los hechos expuestos en sus actas. En virtud 
de tales circunstancias, y con vista de tales hechos, A no podrd 
considerarse como elegido para el cargo en cuestion. El <em>mandamus</em>
 es el recurso mas expedito y eficaz para subsanar tal error." Consejo 
Mun. de Las Piñas<em>contra</em> Juez de 1. Inst de Rizal, 40 Jur. Fil. 
296, 300-301, 302.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Un recurso de <em>mandamus</em> no es una protesta electoral, aunque
 participa en parte de la naturaleza de la misma, y la decision que alli
 se dicta es inapelable.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Aunque la solicitud de <em>mandamus</em>, en realidad, era una 
protesta <em>contra</em> el resultado de la eleccion, de hecho no era 
una morion de protesta. La solicitud de <em>mandamus</em> no tenia por 
objeto que se resolviera una eleccion protestada. No puede el <em>mandamus</em>
 utilizarse para tal fin. Cuando se hace necesario recurrir a las actas y
 considerar cuestiones que afectan a la legalidad o irregularidades de 
la eleccion, o al fraude, emision ilegal de votos etc., el <em>mandamus</em>
 no es el recurso adecuado en tales casos. Dichas cuestiones deben 
suscitarse, ya por una mocion de protesta, ya mediante quo warranto, en 
relacion con los hechos especiales del caso. (pp. 301-302.) * * * La 
sentencia del Juzgado inferior en un <em>mandamus</em>, asi como las 
demas sentencias en asuntos electorates municipales, es firme e 
inapelable." (pag. 303.)</p>
  <p> Concejo Mun. de Las Piñas<em>contra</em> Juez de 1.a Inst. de 
Rizal, <em>supra</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Si el recurso de <em>mandamus</em> prospera y se hace nueva y 
distinta proclamation en su virtud, el candidate afectado adversamente 
por la modification puede protestar <em>contra</em> la eleccion del 
nuevamente declarado electo dentro de los respectivos plazos fijados por
 la ley. Arts. 172, 173 y 174, Cod. Elect. Rev. Pero si pierde el 
recurso, y en el entretanto han transcurrido los diferentes plazos 
legales para protestar sin que separadamnnte, haya protestado <em>contra</em>
 la proclamada eleccion de su adversario, ha perdido definitivamente 
derecho de impugnarla. De la Rosa <em>vs.</em> Yonson, 52 Phil, 446; 
Ferrer <em>vs.</em> Gutierrez David, 43 PhiL, 795; Nisperos <em>vs.</em>

Municipal Council of Masantol <em>vs.</em> Guevara, 44 Phil., 580; 
Hontiveros <em>vs.</em> Altavas, 24 PhiL, 632.</p>
<p> Puede la Comision de Elecciones librar el <em>mandamus</em>, en vez 
de los tribunales de justicia, o concurrentemente con estos? No se 
encuentra en la Constitucion, ni en el Codigo Electoral Revisado una 
disposicion expresa sobre el particular. Los que opinan por la 
afirmativa o deducen de la facultad ejecutiva de la Comision de 
administrar y hacer que se cumplan las leyes sobre la celebracion de las
 elecciones. Sin embargo, en el asunto de Concejo de Las Piñas<em>vs.</em>
 Juez de Rizal, 40 Jur. Fil., 296, esta Corte dijo:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Hemos declarado, en casos en que la Ley Electoral era deficiente,
 que podria recurrirse al procedimiento que dispone la Ley No. 190 
(Arnedo <em>contra</em> Llorente y Liongson, 18 Jur. Fil., 267; Campos <em>contra</em>
 Wislizenus y Aldanese, 35 Jur. Fil., 380, Deogracias cofCtra Abreu y De
 la Santa, 36 Jur. Fil., 523.)"</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Y la competencia para la expedition del remedio de <em>mandamus</em>
 esta prescrita expresamente para los tribunales de justicia. Judicature
 Act. Rep. Act No. 296, Sees. 17, 30, 44; Rules of Court, Rule 67, sees.
 3, 4. Y ciertamente es una prerrogativa judicial.</p>
<p> En el asunto de Ramos <em>vs.</em> Comision de Elecciones, 45 Off. 
Gaz. Supp. 9, pag. 345, se trataba de una peticion de <em>mandamus</em> 
para que se ordene a la Comision a investigar y anular el escrutinio 
hecho por la Junta Municipal de Escrutinio de Bato, Camarines Sur por el
 fundamento de que utilizo un acta falsificada del precinto 10 del 
citado municipio en lugar de la genuina, pues la Comision se abstuvo de 
hacerlo por estar pendiente una protesta electoral tendente a anular la 
eleccion del proclamado electo. En esta Corte hubo empate en la votacion
 del recurso por lo que quedo sobreseido. Regla 56, sec 2, Reglamento de
 los Tribunales. Tres de los Magistrados opuestos al recurso opinaban 
por su desestimacion 1.° porque la facultad era discrecional y 2.° 
porque no puede esperarse que la Comision conozca de quej as similares 
que surgirian en todo Filipinas, por sus limitadas facilidades y 
personal (p&amp;gs. 346, 347). Dos de los opuestos al recurso votaron, 
sin embargo, por otras razones, que el entonces Magistrado Sr. Tuason, 
expuso como sigue:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "I can not share the opinion that the Commission on Elections has 
discretionary power to annul a canvass by the board of canvassers. If it
 had such power I would be inclined to agree that a grave abuse of 
discretion was committed when the Commission denied or declined to act 
on the petition of the local representatives of the Nacionalista Party, 
in the face of its commission's finding that the returns used in the 
canvass were forged. In my opinion the commission had no other 
alternative but to refrain, as it did, from taking cognizance of the 
complaint. A machinery of justice with special, summary jurisdiction and
 clearly outlined procedure has been set up to hear and decide precisely
 such irregularities as are charged in the case at bar. The Commission 
on Elections is an administrative body endowed with administrative 
functions only. Determination of which of two or more conflicting 
returns is authentic is a judicial prerogative. It requires the taking 
of evidence the holding of regular trial, if justice is to be done to 
both parties. It amounts to a power to declare, in some cases as in 
this, that one candidate has been elected over another candidate or 
other candidates. (pag. 348.)</p>
  <p> "As I have said, the subject-matter of the present petition is one
 which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of First 
Instance. If ballot boxes have been destroyed together with their 
contents, that is no ground for taking the case out of the method of 
procedure provided by law. The counting of ballots is not the only mode 
by which a protestant can established his right to be declared elected 
to an office." (pag. 349.)</p>
  <p> Ramos <em>vs.</em> Commission on Election, 45 Off. Gaz. Supp. 9, 
pp. 848-349.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Pero se dice que la facultad de la Comisidn de Elecciones de anular 
una proclamacion de una junta de escrutinio y ordenar un nuevo 
escrutinio ya no puede ponerse en duda, por virtud de la decision de 
esta Corte en el Asunto de Mintu <em>vs.</em> Enage, G. R. No. L-1834 
(Die. 31, 1947). Conforme a la opinion de dos senores magistrados, tal 
facultad esta limitada a errores cometidos en cosas ministeriales y 
administrativas "which do not call for the exercise of judgment." 
Dijeron, en efecto:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "The Commission on Elections has both the power and the duty to 
correct any error committed by election officials in ministerial and 
administrative matters which do not call for the exercise of judgment. 
The case of Mintu et al., <em>vs.</em> Enage et al., G. R. No. L-1834, 
comes under this category- There, the board of canvassers failed to 
perform an administrative duty by omitting to count the votes in some of
 the returns. To count all the returns instead of only some is an 
administrative function which the commission had the authority and the 
duty to compel the board of canvassers to act when the latter refuses 
absolutely to make any canvass."</p>

</blockquote>
<p> Pero todavia otra limitation a la facultad ejecutiva debe notarse. 
La facultad debe y puede ejercerse solamente antes de que alguna parte 
interesada pueda alegar derecho indisputable al cargo por vencimiento 
del plazo para protestar. En efecto, vencido que fuese ese plazo, el 
derecho al cargo queda investido f uera de toda disputa por el acta de 
proclamation, ya que la tinica manera de privarsele del cargo es 
mediante la protesta electoral prescrita por la ley.</p>
<p> En el caso de Concejo Municipal de Las Piñas<em> vs.</em> Juez de 
Primera Instancia, <em>supra</em>, se declaro procedente un <em>mandamus</em>
 judicial en un caso identico al de Mintu <em>contra</em> Enage, <em>supra</em>,
 y la sec. 2 del Art. X de la Constitution no ha privado a los 
tribunales de dicha jurisdiction. La jurisdiction de los tribunales en 
la materia es cosa que preexistia a la Comision y a esta se ha 
encargado, no usurpation de dicha jurisdiction judicial sino observancia
 de dichas leyes, en el desempeno de sus funciones.</p>
<p> De lo expuesto se sigue que, despues de haber quedado firme el acta 
de proclamation de election, por vencimiento del plazo para protestar, 
la Comision de Elecciones pierde toda la autoridad que anteriormente 
podia haber tenido de ordenar su anulacion y alteration de modo que otro
 candidate resulte elegido en lugar del proclamado. Solo puede hacerse 
esto por or den judicial en los casos y en la forma prescritos por la 
ley.</p>
<p> Nos damos cuenta de que, asumiendo que hubo error de suma, el 
proclamado electo.va a continuar en el cargo, no obstante no haber sido 
elegido para el mismo. Si esto no tiene ya remedio, el candidate y 
partido perjudicados no pueden quejarse, porque la culpa es de ellos por
 no haber desplegado un poco de vigilancia que lo hubiera evitado. Es el
 tribute que pagan por su descuido. Desde luego, no es el presente el 
recurso apropiado. Si puede serlo un quo warranto iniciado por el 
Procurador General por orden del Presidente de Filipinas conforme a la 
Regla 68, art. 3, de los Reglamentos, o mediante permiso del Juzgado 
conforme al art. 4 de dicha Regla, y si la prescription de action 
prescrita en el art. 16 de la citada regla ha quedado ihterrumpida, o si
 otro remedio mas existe, quaere. Lo qiie ahora debe enfatizarse es que 
no de curarse un error con otro error, esto es improvisando una facultad
 y un procedimiento irregular y arbitrario, por muy bien intencionado 
que esto fuese. Un regimen bien ordenado requiere que los remedios se 
otorguen por la autoridad llamada por la ley a ello y conforme al 
procedimiento regular prescrito.</p>
<p> Voto por que se conceda el remedio solicitado, y consecuentemente 
que se dejen sin ningun valor ni ef ecto la orden de anulacion de la 
proclamacion de eleccion del recurrente ordenada por la Gomision de 
Elecciones, asi como la nueva proclamacion de eleccion a favor de 
Gutierrez hecha en su virtud por la Junta Municipal de Escrutinio, sin 
especial pronunciamiento en cuanto a las costas.<br>

<h3 align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></h3>
<p><strong>REYES, J.:</strong></p>
<p> This is a petition for certiorari. As stated in the majority 
opinion, the only question posed is whether the Commission on Elections 
may order a municipal board of canvassers to correct a patent error 
committed by said board in adding up the total votes reported in the 
returns from the different precincts when the candidates erroneously 
proclaimed as a result of the wrong addition has already assumed office 
and the period for contesting his election has already expired. The 
returns are not here in dispute. The error in addition is admitted. Its 
correction is a purely clerical and ministerial task not calling for the
 exercise of judgment. And yet the majority opinion answers the question
 in the negative and would install in an elective public office one who,
 admittedly, has not been thereunto elected. To this I can not agree.</p>
<p> The facts are not in dispute. Isidro de Leon and Fortunato Gutierrez
 were among the candidates for municipal councilors of Makati, Rizal, 
voted for in the election held on November 13, 1951. There were 8 
councilors to be elected, and on the basis of the votes shown in the 
election returns from the different precincts Gutierrez had occupied 8th
 place with a total of 3,098 votes in his favor as against 3,060 votes 
in favor of De Leon, his closest contender for that place. But due to a 
mistake in addition the municipal board of canvassers, which met on 
November 18, 1951, to canvass the returns, credited De Leon with 3,160 
votes and proclaimed him the elected 8th councilor of the municipality.</p>
<p> Informed of the error committed by the municipal board of 
canvassers, Gutierrez on April 12, 1952, petitioned the Commission on 
Elections to annul the proclamation of De Leon and order the board to 
make a new canvass. De Leon opposed the petition. Bat the Commission, 
after hearing, granted the petition, annulled the proclamation in favor 
of De Leon and directed the board to reconvene and recanvass the votes 
received by these two candidates and proclaim the one that came out the 
winner according to the result.</p>
<p> Proceeding as directed by the Commission, the municipal board of 
canvassers reconvened on May 31, 1952, to recanvass the election returns
 and, having found that Gutierrez had polled more votes than De Leon, 
proclaimed the former elected 8th councilor of Makati.</p>
<p> The present petition, as amended, seeks the annulment of this 
proclamation as illegal and the restoration of petitioner to the office 
of 8th councilor of Makati. But it appears that petitioner has, in 
addition, filed in the Court of First Instance of Rizal an election 
protest, dated June 2, 1952, contesting the election of Gutierrez.</p>
<p> It is admitted that the municipal board of canvassers had made a 
mistake in adding up the votes reported in the election returns and that
 due to this mistake in addition De Leon was proclaimed elected. The 
question presented is whether a mistake of that kind may be ordered 
corrected by the Commission on Elections after the candidate erroneously
 proclaimed has already assumed office.</p>
<p> Section 168 of the Revised Election Law provides that the municipal 
board of canvassers shall meet immediately after the election, count the
 votes cast for candidates for municipal offices as reported in the 
returns or statements of election from the different precincts "and 
proclaim as elected for said offices those who have polled the largest 
number of votes for the different offices." The next section then 
provides that immediately after the completion of the canvass, the board
 shall make a statement in quadruplicate of the results, which statement
 shall be signed by the members of the board present, and a copy of the 
same shall be filed with each of the offices mentioned in said section. 
The signing of this statement concludes the work of the board and for 
that reason the board is thereafter usually deemed <em>functus oficio</em>.
 But this notwithstanding, it has been held that where the board has 
made an illegal proclamation, it may thereafter, without any court 
order, meet again, annul the proclamation and make a new one (Yap <em>vs.</em>
 Court of First Instance, 66 Phil., 112). And the board may also meet 
again to correct an error in its certificate when "by some proper 
authority it is ordered so to do". (Cordero <em>vs.</em> Judge, 40 
Phil., 246-) Thus, in the case of Municipality of Las Piñas <em>vs.</em>
 Judge, 40 Phil., 279, where the board of canvassers had certified that a
 certain candidate for a municipal office received 139 votes in one 
precinct when actually he received 143 votes, it was held that the board
 could be ordered to reconvene to correct its certificate. Citing Paine 
on Elections, this Court said in that case that "until the board of 
canvassers had performed the exact duties imposed upon it by law it must
 be considered as in default."</p>
<p> It is argued, however, that after the board has made its certificate
 of election only a court could order it to reconvene, and this seems to
 be implied in the decisions above cited. Petitioner also cites section 
154 of the Revised Election Law which forbids "the board of inspectors" 
from altering or amending any of its statements after the announcement 
of the result of the election unless so ordered by a competent court. 
But the section cited refers to the election inspectors and not to the 
municipal board of canvassers, which, as declared in Galvez <em>vs.</em>
 Miranda et al., 36 Phil., 316, 320, is authorized "to correct clerical 
errors and other errors of a like character." And as to the decisions 
requiring judicial authority for making corrections, it should be 
recalled that those decisions were rendered before the creation of the 
Commission on Elections, the agency set up by the Constitution for "the 
enforcement and administration of all laws relative to the conduct of 
elections" (Art. X, sec. 2, Constitution of the Philippines.)</p>
<p> The authority of the Commission on Elections in a proper case to 
annul a proclamation made by a municipal board of canvassers and order a
 new canvass of the election returns can no longer be doubted. That 
authority has already been upheld by this court in Mintu <em>vs.</em> 
Enage, G. R. No. L-1834 (Dec. 31, 1947). In that case the Commission had
 annulled a proclamation made by a municipal board of canvassers on the 
basis of returns from only some of the election precincts, and this 
court ruled that the Commission in so doing had neither exceeded its 
jurisdiction nor committed a grave abuse of discretion. If the 
Commission has to correct an irregularity of this nature there is no 
reason why it may not also correct a mere clerical error such as that 
committed by the municipal board of canvassers in the present case. As 
stated by Mr. Justice Tuason in Ramos <em>vs.</em> Commission on 
Elections, 45 Off. Gaz. (Supp. No. 9) 345, 348, "the Commission on 
Elections has both the power and the duty to correct any error committed
 by election officials in the ministerial and administrative matters 
which do not call for the exercise of judgment."</p>
<p> There is nothing to the suggestion that the petition for correction 
which Gutierrez addressed to the Commission was but "a disguised 
election protest" cognizable only by the courts. The petition did not 
make it "necessary to go behind the returns and to consider questions 
touching the legality or irregularities of the election, or of fraud, 
illegal voting, etc." (Municipality of Las Piñas<em>vs.</em> Judge <em>supra</em>.)
 All that was required was the correction of a manifest mistake in 
addition, which was a purely ministerial or mechanical duty. Not being 
an election protest, the petition for correction did not have to be 
filed in the Court of First Instance and within a time prescribed in 
section 174 of the Revised Election Law. The remedy invoked was purely 
administrative for which no prescription period has so far been 
provided.</p>
<p> Neither could the fact that the candidate erroneously proclaimed has
 already assumed office preclude the exercise of the corrective power of
 the Commission. If the Commission had that power before the candidate 
assumed office, there can be no reason why it should not have that same 
power thereafter. The doctrine of estoppel or laches cannot properly be 
invoked in this case for the office of the municipal councilor is a 
public trust and it is against the law to have it occupied by one who is
 not the true choice of the electorate.</p>
<p> In view of the foregoing, I vote for the denial of the present 
petition for certiorari.</p>
<p> <em>Padilla, Jugo, </em>and <em>Concepcion, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
<hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<h3 align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MONTEMAYOR, J.,:</strong></p>
<p> In the learned dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Reyes, I fully 
concur. I just wish to stress the point that in ordering the correction 
of a clear, undisputed, simple mistake—either a clerical error or a 
mistake in addition the Commission on Elections did not exercise a 
judicial power of function and invade the province and jurisdiction of 
the courts, but it merely performed a purely administrative duty in 
connection with its being in charge of the enforcement and 
administration of laws related to the conduct of elections, and its 
right and obligation to decide, save those involving the right to vote, 
all administrative questions affecting elections, as set forth in the 
Constitution.</p>
<p> Respondent Gutierrez may have been a little negligent and law in his
 vigilance. But his fault if any was his trust and confidence in the 
care and ability of the members of the Board of Canvassers to add short 
and simple numbers of two or three digits. Anyone of us unless extremely
 wary, and suspicious of fraud or deception, is liable to incur in the 
same laxity or fault arid repose implicit confidence in the ability of 
the Board of Canvassers, composed of the members of the municipal 
council to perform a ministerial and mathematical duty—simple addition, 
known and daily performed by elementary grade pupils.</p>
<p> The ordinary citizen who makes up the bulk of our population, not 
versed in the law and its intricacies and technicalities, finds it 
difficult if not impossible to understand why a candidate for councilor 
receiving 3,060 votes js made to win over another candidate garnering a 
larger number of votes—3,098, just because thru a clerical error or a 
mistake in addition the votes for the first candidate were made to 
appear as 3,160 instead of 3,060. Said ordinary citizen's immediate and 
only reaction would be to wonder and ask why such a thing can happen in a
 free country, and why the error should not and cannot forthwith be 
corrected. He is confused, and added to his confusion, he is baffled by 
the refusal of the majority of this Tribunal to correct the mistake, and
 its insistence in continuing and perpetuating a grievious error—that of
 maintaining in the municipal council a candidate not duly elected 
thereto except thru a clerical error or mistake in addition, in place of
 another candidate receiving a larger number of votes and therefore the 
choice of the electorate:</p>
<p> Petition granted.</p>
