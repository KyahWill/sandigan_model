				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the general elections held on November 8, 1955, Mateo V. Tupaz, Filemon 
Durano, Godiardo Guillen, Teofilo H. Sanchez and Gabriel R. Banaag were on 
November 25, 1955, proclaimed by the City Board of Canvassers elected councilors 
of the City of Butuan. On December 6, 1955, Ramon Rosales and others filed their 
election protest, and on December 10, 1955, the protestees moved for the 
dismissal of the protest on the ground of lack of cause of action. The protest 
having been dismissed, the protestants filed on April 24, 1956 a motion for 
reconsideration and on April 25, 1956, an amended election protest. As the 
motion for reconsideration was denied and the amended election protest was not 
admitted for having been filed out of time, the protestants have appealed. 
<p>The lower court dismissed the original protest on the ground that it states 
no allegation that the frauds, errors, irregularities and violation of election 
law mentioned therein would in any way alter the result of the election in favor 
of the protestees." This is erroneous, considering the allegations of 
sub-paragraph (i) of the protest, in relation to those contained in 
sub-paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), 
(<i>f</i>), (<i>g</i>), and (<i>h</i>) of paragraph 4. As the last part of 
sub-paragraph (i) avers "which causes directly affected the election results in 
all precincts in the City of Butuan in favor of the protestees and against the 
protestants", a reasonable construction would be that the word "causes" refers 
to the irregularities, frauds, errors, and violations of the Election Law 
enumerated in the preceding sub-paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), 
(<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), (<i>f</i>), (<i>g</i>), and (<i>h</i>) and in the first 
part of sub-paragraph (i). In other words, were it not for the existence of 
those "causes" the results of the election would have been different, and the 
protestants should have won and the protestees would have lost. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the amended protest filed by the appellants should not have been 
dismissed. No new grounds were inserted therein, the amendments consisting 
merely of clarifications of the allegations of the original protest. There was 
as yet no trial, and it was filed within a reasonable period. </p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed order of dismissal is hereby set aside and the lower 
court is ordered to give due course to the protest. So ordered. </p>
<p><i>Bengzon, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and 
<i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur. </p></div>
