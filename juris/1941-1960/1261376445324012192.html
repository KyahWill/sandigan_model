				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal from&nbsp; a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dismissing an action brought by&nbsp; the spouses Manuel Buason and Lolita M. Reyes for annulment of a deed of sale in favor of the defendant, cancellation of transfer certificate of title No. 8419 issued in the name of the defendant and his wife, declaration that the sale in their favor is valid, recovery of possession of&nbsp; the parcel of land described&nbsp; in the complaint from the defendant, damages,&nbsp; attorney's fees and costs.&nbsp; (Civil No. 2144.)<br><br>In&nbsp; their lifetime&nbsp; the spouses&nbsp; Buenaventura Dayao and Eugenia&nbsp; Vega acquired by&nbsp; homestead patent a parcel of land situated at barrio Gabaldon, municipality of Mu√±oz, province of Nueva&nbsp; Ecija, containing an area of 14.8413 hectares&nbsp; covered&nbsp; by original certificate&nbsp; of title No. 1187 (Exhibit C).&nbsp; On 29 October 1930 they executed a power of attorney authorizing Eustaquio Bayuga to engage the services&nbsp; of an attorney to prosecute their&nbsp; case against Leonardo Gambito&nbsp; for annulment of&nbsp; a contract of sale of the parcel of land (civil No. 5787 of the same court) and after the termination&nbsp; of the case in&nbsp; their&nbsp; favor to&nbsp; sell it,&nbsp; and from the proceeds of the sale&nbsp; to&nbsp; deduct whatever expenses he had incurred in the litigation (Exhibit&nbsp; B).&nbsp; On 14 March 1934 Buenaventura Dayao died leaving his wife&nbsp; Eugenia Vega and children Pablo, Teodoro, Fortunata&nbsp; and Juliana, all surnamed&nbsp; Dayao.&nbsp; On 21&nbsp; March&nbsp; 1939 his four children&nbsp; executed a deed of sale conveying&nbsp; 12.8413 hectares of the parcel of&nbsp; land to the appellants,&nbsp; the&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Buason and Lolita&nbsp; M. Reyes (Exhibit A).&nbsp;&nbsp; Their&nbsp; mother Eugenia&nbsp; Vega affixed her thumbmark to the deed of&nbsp; sale as witness&nbsp; (Exhibit A).&nbsp; The appellants took possession&nbsp; of the parcel of&nbsp; land through their tenants&nbsp; in 1939. On 18 July 1944 Eustaquio Bayuga&nbsp; sold 8 hectares of the same&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; to the spouses&nbsp; Mariano&nbsp; Panuyas&nbsp;&nbsp; (appellee&nbsp; herein)&nbsp; and Sotera B. Cruz (Exhibit D).&nbsp; Eustaquio&nbsp; Bayuga&nbsp; died on 25 March 1946 and Eugenia Vega in 1954.<br><br>The appellants and the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; claim ownership to the same parcel of land.&nbsp; In their complaint the appellants prayed that the appellee be ordered to deliver possession of the part of the parcel of land held by him;&nbsp; that the deed of sale of that&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; parcel of land held by the appellee executed by Eustaquio&nbsp; Bayuga&nbsp; in his favor and of&nbsp; his wife&nbsp; (Exhibit D) be&nbsp; declared null and&nbsp; void and that transfer certificate of title No. 8419 issued in their&nbsp; name be cancelled; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed of&nbsp; sale of the parcel of&nbsp; land&nbsp; executed by the&nbsp; children and&nbsp; heirs of Buenaventura Dayao&nbsp; in&nbsp; their favor&nbsp; (Exhibit A) be declared valid; that the appellee&nbsp; be ordered to pay&nbsp; them damages and attorney's&nbsp; fees in the sum of P9,600; and that he be ordered&nbsp; to pay the costs of the suit.&nbsp; The appellee's&nbsp; affirmative&nbsp; defenses are that&nbsp; he and&nbsp; his&nbsp; wife were buyers in good faith and for valuable consideration; that appellants' causes of action are&nbsp; barred by the statute of limitations;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; the complaint&nbsp; states no cause of action;&nbsp; that the claim&nbsp; on&nbsp; which their&nbsp; action&nbsp; is based is unenforceable&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; of frauds; and&nbsp; that the appellants are guilty of laches.&nbsp;&nbsp; By way&nbsp; of counterclaim, he&nbsp; prayed that for&nbsp; bringing a clearly unfounded suit against him which depreciated the value of the&nbsp; land and injured his good&nbsp; reputation, the appellants be ordered to pay&nbsp; him the&nbsp; sums of P5,000 as&nbsp; actual damages and P 10,000 as&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages.<br><br>After trial on 20 August 1956&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court rendered judgment&nbsp; holding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants'&nbsp; action is barred by the&nbsp; statute of limitations and dismissing their&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp; Their motion for reconsideration filed on 23&nbsp; August 1956&nbsp; was&nbsp; denied&nbsp; on 28 August&nbsp; 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence&nbsp; this appeal upon questions of law.<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that the appellants did&nbsp; not register&nbsp; the sale of 12.8413 hectares of the parcel of land&nbsp; in question executed in their favor&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Dayao children&nbsp; on 21 March 1939 after the death of their father Buenaventura Dayao.&nbsp; On the other hand, the power of attorney executed by Buenaventura Dayao on 29 October 1930 authorizing Eustaquio Bayuga to sell the&nbsp; parcel of land (Exhibit B) was annotated or&nbsp; inscribed on&nbsp; the back of original&nbsp; certificate of&nbsp; title No. 1187&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; C)&nbsp; as&nbsp; Entry&nbsp; No. 16836/H-1187, and the sale executed by Eustaquio Bayuga in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; appellee Mariano Panuyas and his wife Sotera B. Cruz&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforesaid&nbsp; power of attorney was annotated&nbsp; or inscribed&nbsp; on the back of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same original certificate of&nbsp; title (Exhibit&nbsp; C)&nbsp; as Entry&nbsp; No. 778/H-1187.&nbsp; It does not&nbsp; appear that the appellee&nbsp; and his&nbsp; wife had actual knowledge&nbsp; of the previous sale. In the absence&nbsp; of such knowledge, they had&nbsp; a right to rely on the&nbsp; face of the certificate of title of the registered owners and of the authority conferred by them upon&nbsp; the agent&nbsp; also&nbsp; recorded&nbsp; on the&nbsp; back of the&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of title.&nbsp; As this is a case of double sale of land registered under&nbsp; the Land&nbsp; Registration&nbsp; Act, he who recorded&nbsp; the sale in the Registry of Deeds&nbsp; has&nbsp; a better right than he who did not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>As to the appellants'&nbsp; contention that, as the death of the principal on&nbsp; 14 March 1934 ended the authority of the agent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; the sale of 8 hectares of the parcel of land by the&nbsp; agent to the appellee&nbsp; Mariano Panuyas and&nbsp; his wife Sotera B.&nbsp; Cruz was null and void, suffice&nbsp; it&nbsp; to state that it has not been shown that&nbsp; the&nbsp; agent knew of his principal's&nbsp; demise,&nbsp; and&nbsp; for&nbsp; that reason&nbsp; article 1738, old&nbsp; Civil Code&nbsp; or 1931, new&nbsp; Civil Code, which provides:<br><br>Anything&nbsp; done&nbsp; by the agent,&nbsp; without knowledge of the&nbsp; death of the principal&nbsp; or&nbsp; of any other cause which&nbsp; extinguishes the agency, is valid and shall be fully effective with respect to third persons who may&nbsp; have contracted with him in good faith. is the law applicable to the point raised by the&nbsp; appellants.<br><br>The judgment appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
