				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition&nbsp; for certiorari&nbsp; to&nbsp; review the decision of the Court of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations&nbsp; in&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 215— Pampanga&nbsp;&nbsp; (later&nbsp; transferred&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Agrarian Relations which&nbsp; denied&nbsp; reconsideration of the&nbsp; Industrial Court's&nbsp; decision)&nbsp; authorizing the ejectment&nbsp; of petitioners from their respective landholdings,&nbsp; and their&nbsp; replacement by other tenants of&nbsp; their landlord's&nbsp; choice. It appears that petitioners&nbsp; Apolonio Pangilinan, Mariano Bundalian, Miguel&nbsp; Galang, and Valentin Santos are tenants of respondents Felisa Alvendía in barrios San&nbsp; Nicolas and Sto.&nbsp; Cristo,&nbsp; Florida Blanca,&nbsp; Pampanga, under tenancy contracts&nbsp; executed&nbsp; on July 17, 1953&nbsp; (Exhibits A, B,&nbsp; C, and&nbsp; D).&nbsp; On July 27,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; respondent Alvendia filed a petition in the Court of Industrial Relations for the ejectment of petitioners on the ground that for the agricultural years 1953-54 and 1954-55, they did not personally&nbsp; perform the principal work&nbsp; of plowing&nbsp; and harrowing on their respective&nbsp; landholdings, but entrusted said work&nbsp; to other persons, notwithstanding repeated demands by respondent&nbsp; that they do&nbsp; the farm work&nbsp; themselves.&nbsp; Petitioners, in their answer, denied respondent's claims, and alleged that they were the ones working the land although at times, they&nbsp; were helped by their children&nbsp; and&nbsp; sons-in-law;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; filed&nbsp; the&nbsp; ejectment&nbsp; action against them because they refused to&nbsp; sign&nbsp; tenancy&nbsp; contracts with her on the&nbsp; 45-55 sharing&nbsp; basis and insisted on a 70-30 sharing basis.<br><br>After trial, the Industrial Court found that petitioners were being helped&nbsp; either by&nbsp; their sons, sons-in-law, or grandsons on their landholdings; held that&nbsp; a contract of tenancy&nbsp; is personal in nature&nbsp; and&nbsp; can&nbsp; not&nbsp; be entrusted to a son, son-in-law or&nbsp; grandson,&nbsp; especially where there is a&nbsp; specific&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; in the tenancy contracts against allowing third persons to do the principal phases of farming for the tenants; and authorized petitioners' ejectment and&nbsp; replacement by other tenants.&nbsp; The case&nbsp; was later transferred to the Court of Agrarian Relations upon its creation where petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of the&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Court's&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; which was denied. Hence, their present appeal.<br><br>The&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; found that the "third persons" referred to by respondent Alvendia to whom petitioners allegedly entrusted the work of&nbsp; plowing and&nbsp; harrowing on their respective landholdings&nbsp; were&nbsp; either their sons-in-law&nbsp; or grandsons who&nbsp; were not, however, dependent upon them for&nbsp; support&nbsp; and were living separately from them.&nbsp; The issue, therefore, is whether&nbsp; petitioners violated the law and their tenancy contracts in entrusting their farm work to such relatives.<br><br>Republic Act 1199,&nbsp; which&nbsp; took&nbsp; effect on August&nbsp; 30, 1954, defines "tenant"&nbsp; as:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; * *&nbsp; a person who, himself and&nbsp; with&nbsp; the aid available from within his&nbsp; immediate farm household,&nbsp; cultivates the land belonging to, or possessed&nbsp; by&nbsp; another, with the&nbsp; latter's consent, for purpose of production, sharing the produce with the landholder under&nbsp; the share&nbsp; tenancy system, or paying to the landholder&nbsp; a price certain or ascertainable&nbsp; in&nbsp; produce&nbsp; or in&nbsp; money&nbsp; or&nbsp; both,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the leasehold tenancy system";<br><br>While "immediate farm&nbsp; household,"&nbsp; according to the same Act, includes:<br><br>"* *&nbsp; * the members of&nbsp; the family&nbsp; of the tenant, and&nbsp; such other person or persons, whether related&nbsp; to&nbsp; the tenant or not,&nbsp; who&nbsp; are dependent upon him for&nbsp; support and who usually help him operate the farm enterprise".</blockquote>Under&nbsp; the above&nbsp; definition of "tenant"&nbsp; given&nbsp; by Republic Act 1199, petitioners were within their legal rights in asking assistance in their farm work from their sons-in-law or&nbsp; grandsons.&nbsp; Such relatives fall within the phrase "the members of the family of the tenant"; and. the law does not require that&nbsp; these members of the tenant's family be dependent on him for support, such qualification being applicable only to "such other person&nbsp; or persons, whether related to the&nbsp; tenant&nbsp; or&nbsp; not",&nbsp; whom,&nbsp; as&nbsp; they&nbsp; are "dependent&nbsp; upon him for&nbsp; support"&nbsp; and&nbsp; "usually&nbsp; help him operate the farm enterprise", the law considers&nbsp; also part of the tenant's immediate household.<br><br>But respondent Alvendia&nbsp; claims that as&nbsp; her&nbsp; contracts with&nbsp; petitioners were&nbsp; entered&nbsp; into when&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 4054, the old Tenancy Act, was still in force, the definition of the word "tenant" given&nbsp; in said Act&nbsp; should be applied in this case,&nbsp; to wit:<br><blockquote>" *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * farmer&nbsp; or&nbsp; farm laborer who undertakes&nbsp; to&nbsp; work and cultivate land for another&nbsp; or a&nbsp; person who furnishes the labor with the consent of the landlord."</blockquote>Granting&nbsp; that&nbsp; Act 4054 applies to&nbsp; this case, there&nbsp; is, however,&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; above definition of&nbsp; "tenant"&nbsp; to prohibit the farmer who undertakes to work and cultivate the&nbsp; land&nbsp; of another, from doing&nbsp; such&nbsp; work with the assistance of his family, who are under his control and authority.&nbsp; The above definition is,&nbsp; in fact,&nbsp; so broad that it even&nbsp; includes the&nbsp; labor of third persons&nbsp; hired&nbsp; by the farmer&nbsp; to work on&nbsp; his&nbsp; farm,&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; clause&nbsp; "or&nbsp; a person who furnishes the labor with&nbsp; the consent&nbsp; of the landlord".&nbsp; It is the hiring of&nbsp; third&nbsp; persons to&nbsp; do the farm&nbsp; work&nbsp; for the&nbsp; tenant that the&nbsp; new&nbsp; tenancy&nbsp; law, Republic Act No. 1199, eliminated from the old concept of "tenant" under Act&nbsp; 4054,&nbsp; thus restricting&nbsp; the&nbsp; meaning of "tenant"&nbsp; to&nbsp; one&nbsp; "who, himself and&nbsp; with&nbsp; the aid avail- able from within his immediate farm household, cultivates the&nbsp; land&nbsp; belonging to,&nbsp; or possessed&nbsp; by,&nbsp; another,&nbsp; with the latter's&nbsp; consent * *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; Whether under the&nbsp; new&nbsp; or the&nbsp; old&nbsp; tenancy law, therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; work&nbsp;&nbsp; done&nbsp; by the members of a&nbsp; tenant's family is, in legal contemplation, included in the&nbsp; work that the tenant undertakes to perform on the land given&nbsp; to&nbsp; him in tenancy.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of clear&nbsp; and categorical imperatives, we will&nbsp; not construe statutes&nbsp; in a sense&nbsp; inconsistent with the traditional unity of the Filipino&nbsp; family.<br><br>Respondent&nbsp; Alvendia&nbsp; also&nbsp; contends that&nbsp; her tenancy contract with&nbsp; petitioners, Exhibits&nbsp; A, B, C, and&nbsp; D, expressly prohibit the latter from asking for and accepting help in&nbsp; the&nbsp; cultivation&nbsp; of their landholdings from their sons-in-law and grandsons, under the provision in&nbsp; said contracts that:<br><blockquote>"(a)&nbsp; The Tenant&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; one&nbsp; to plow,&nbsp; harrow and&nbsp; prepare the land to be planted, and likewise, he&nbsp; is the one to plant and fence the&nbsp; seedbed.&nbsp; With respect to this work, tho&nbsp; LANDLORD&nbsp; shall not&nbsp; spend&nbsp; for anything,&nbsp; but&nbsp; she has the&nbsp; power to tell or order the&nbsp; TENANT when to plow,&nbsp; harrow,&nbsp; or what&nbsp; to&nbsp; do pertaining&nbsp; the tenant's work,"</blockquote>The above provision&nbsp; contains&nbsp; no prohibition&nbsp; for&nbsp; the tenant to accept assistance from the members&nbsp; of his&nbsp; family<br><br>in the plowing, harrowing, preparing, planting, or fencing of his landholding.&nbsp;&nbsp; It simply enumerates the exact duties expected of the tenant&nbsp; by his landlord; and the tenant is referred to as "the one" to perform these duties, only to distinguish his&nbsp; obligations from those of his&nbsp; landlord. We&nbsp; see nothing in farming tasks that requires individual specialized&nbsp; skill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; a fact&nbsp; that petitioners Galang and Santos were&nbsp; already&nbsp; 74 and 64,&nbsp; respectively, when respondent signed the tenancy contracts with them in 1953.&nbsp; Respondent's having accepted petitioners&nbsp; Galang and Santos as her tenants in spite of&nbsp; their advanced age not&nbsp; only disproves her claim&nbsp; that they&nbsp; are&nbsp; already too old&nbsp; to&nbsp; perform&nbsp; their duties as tenants,&nbsp; but&nbsp; proves that she&nbsp; had&nbsp; impliedly agreed&nbsp; that these petitioners would be&nbsp; helped&nbsp; by their&nbsp; families&nbsp; in&nbsp; their farm&nbsp; work, since respondent must have realized that at their&nbsp; advanced age, these petitioners could&nbsp; not by&nbsp; themselves alone&nbsp; perform all&nbsp; the&nbsp; farm work without family assistance.<br><br>The decision&nbsp; appealed from is,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; reversed, and the&nbsp; ejectment&nbsp; action filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; against petitioners&nbsp; dismissed, with costs&nbsp; against respondent Felisa Alvendía.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception,&nbsp; Endencia</i>,&nbsp;&nbsp; and <i>Felix,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
