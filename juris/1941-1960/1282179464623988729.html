				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant, waiving the right to be 
assisted by counsel, pleaded guilty to the following information filed against 
him in the Court of First Instance of Manila:<br>
<blockquote>
<p>"The undersigned accuses Rafael Balmores y Caya of attempted estafa thru 
falsification of a security, committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about the 
22nd day of September, 1947, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said 
accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously commence the 
commission of the crime of estafa thru falsification of a security directly by 
overt acts, to wit: by then and there tearing off at the bottom in a cross-wise 
direction a portion of a genuine 1/8 unit Philippine Charity Sweepstakes ticket 
thereby removing the true and real unidentified number of same and substituting 
and writing in ink at the bottom on the left side of said ticket the figure or 
number 074000 thus making the said ticket bear the said number 074000, which is 
a prize-winning number in the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes draw last June 29, 
1947, and presenting the said ticket so falsified on said date, September 22, 
1947, in the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office for the purpose of exchanging 
the same for the corresponding cash that said number had won, fraudulently 
pretending in said Office that the said 1/8 unit of a Philippine Charity 
Sweepstakes ticket is genuine and that he is entitled to the corresponding 
amount of P359.55 so won by said ticket in the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes 
draw on said date, June 29, 1947, but the said accused failed to perform all the 
acts of execution which would have produced the crime of estafa thru 
falsification of a security as a consequence by reason of some causes other than 
his spontaneous desistance, to wit: one Bayani Miller, an employee to whom the 
said accused presented said ticket in the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office 
discovered that the said ticket as presented by the said accused was falsified 
and immediately thereafter he called for a policeman who apprehended and 
arrested the said accused right then and there. </p>

<p>and was sentenced by Judge Emilio Pe√±a to suffer not less than 10 years and 1 
day of <em>prision mayor</em> and not more than 12 years and 1 day of 
<em>reclusion temporal</em>, and to pay a fine of P100 and the 
costs.<br><br>From that sentence he appealed to this court, contending (1) that 
the facts charged in the information did not constitute an offense and (2) that 
the trial court lacked jurisdiction to convict him on a plea of guilty because, 
being illiterate, he was not assisted by counsel.<br><br>In support of the first 
contention, counsel for the appellant argues that there could be no genuine 1/8 
unit Philippine Charity Sweepstakes ticket for the June 29, 1947, draw; that 
this court has judicial notice that the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office 
issued only four 1/4 units for each ticket for the said draw of June 29, 1947; 
that the information does not show that the true and real unidentified number of 
the ticket alleged to have been torn was not and could not be 074000; that the 
substitution and writing in ink of the said number 074000 was not falsification 
where the true and real number of the ticket so torn was 074000.<br><br>This 
contention is based on assumptions not borne out by the record. The ticket 
alleged to have been falsified is before us and it appears to be a 1/8 unit. We 
cannot take judicial notice of what is not of common knowledge. If relevant, it 
should have been proved. But if it is true that the Philippine Charity 
Sweepstakes Office did not issue 1/8 but only 1/4 units of tickets for the June 
29, 1947, draw, that would only strengthen the theory of the prosecution that 
the 1/8 unit of a ticket which appellant presented to the Philippine Charity 
Sweepstakes Office was spurious. The assumption that the true and real 
unidentified number of the ticket alleged to have been torn was the winning 
number 074000, is likewise not supported by the record. The information to which 
appellant pleaded guilty alleged that the appellant removed the true and real 
unidentified number of the ticket and <em>substituted</em> and wrote in ink at 
the bottom on the left side of said ticket the figure or number 074000. It is 
obvious that there would have been no need of removal and <em>substitution</em> 
if the original number on the ticket was the same as that which appellant wrote 
in ink in lieu thereof.<br><br>The second contention appears to be based on a 
correct premise but wrong conclusion. The fact that appellant was illiterate did 
not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to convict him on a plea of guilty 
although he was not assisted by counsel. The decision expressly states that 
appellant waived the right to be assisted by counsel, and we know of no law 
against such waiver.<br><br>It may be that appellant was either reckless.or 
foolish in believing that a falsification as patent as that which he admitted to 
have perpetrated would succeed; but the recklessness and clumsiness of the 
falsification did not make the crime impossible within the purview of paragraph 
2, article 4, in relation to article 59, of the Revised Penal Code. Examples of 
an impossible crime, which formerly was not punishable but is now so under 
article 59 of the Revised Penal Code, are the following: (1) Mien one tries to 
kill another by putting in his soup a substance which he believes to be arsenic 
when in fact it is common salt; and (2) when one tries to murder a corpse. 
(Guevara, Commentaries on the Revised Penal Code, 4th ed., page 15; decision, 
Supreme Court of Spain, November 26, 1879; 21 Jur. Crim. 343.) Judging from the 
appearance of the falsified ticket in question, we are not prepared to say that 
it would have been impossible for the appellant to consummate the crime of 
estafa thru falsification of said ticket if the clerk to whom it was presented 
for payment had not exercised due care.<br><br>The penalty imposed by article 
166 for the forging or falsification of "treasury or bank notes or certificates 
or <em>other obligations arid securities"</em> is <em>reclusion temporal</em> in 
its minimum period and a fine not to exceed P10,000, if the document which has 
been falsified, counterfeited, or altered is an obligation or security of the 
United States or of the Philippine Islands. This being a complex crime of 
attempted estafa thru falsification of an obligation or security of the 
Philippines, the penalty should be imposed in its maximum period in accordance 
with article 48. Taking into consideration the mitigating circumstance of lack 
of instruction, and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum cannot 
be lower than <em>prision mayor</em> in its maximum period, which is 10 years 
and 1 day to 12 years. It results, therefore, that the penalty imposed by the 
trial court is correct.<br><br>The alteration, or even destruction, of a losing 
sweepstakes ticket could cause no harm to anyone and would not constitute a 
crime were it not for the attempt to cash the ticket so altered as a 
prize-winning number. So in the ultimate analysis appellant's real offense was 
the attempt to commit estafa (punishable with eleven days of <em>arresto 
menor</em>); but technically and legally he has to suffer for the serious crime 
of falsification of a government obligation. We realize that the penalty is too 
severe, considering all the circumstances of the case, but we have no discretion 
to impose a lower penalty than that authorized by law. The exercise of clemency 
is vested by the Constitution in the Chief Executive and not in this 
court.<br><br>We are constrained to affirm the sentence appealed from, with 
costs against the appellant</p>
<p><em>Moran, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes</em>, 
and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur.<br><br></p>

<p>PARAS, J.: dissenting: </p>
<p>The accused-appellant, instead of being the victimizer, has become the 
victim. He was accused of having falsified a genuine 1/8 unit of the Philippine 
Charity Sweepstakes ticket for the June, 1947, draw by tearing off at its bottom 
in a cross-wise direction a portion, thereby removing the true and unidentified 
number of said ticket and substituting and writing in ink at the bottom on the 
left side the number 074000, thus making said ticket bear a prize-winning 
number. He was convicted of attempted estafa thru falsification of an obligation 
or security and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from 10 years and 1 day 
of <em>prision mayor</em> to 12 years and 1 day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, 
and to pay a fine of P100 plus the costs. He waived the right to be assisted by 
counsel and merely pleaded guilty to the information.<br><br>The appellant is 
admittedly an illiterate and, in my opinion, had committed only an impossible 
crime now punishable under paragraph 2, article 4, in relation to article 59, of 
the Revised Penal Code. I say impossible, because in the way the alleged 
falsification was done, it was inherently inadequate or ineffective and 
accordingly certain to be detected. Stated otherwise, the appellant could not 
have succeeded in cashing the ticket. For who would cash a ticket which, in the 
first place, has a missing portion and, in the second place, contains a number 
written in ink. Hot even boy-agents who conduct their trades on street 
sidewalks, and much less the employee of the Sweepstakes Office to whom it was 
presented. As a natter of fact, the falsification was readily detected by said 
employee. The crime is just as impossible as passing a counterfeit paper bill 
concocted in regular newsprint and in ordinary handwriting.<br><br>A doubt also 
arises from the fact that the ticket is a 1/8 unit, in the face of the 
contention of attorney for appellant in this instance that the tickets for the 
June, 1947, Sweepstakes draw consisted of only four units. Of course, this may 
not be a matter of judicial notice, but the point remains that if appellant was 
assisted by competent counsel in the trial court, the fact might have been duly 
proven. It is true that the appellant waived his right to be assisted by 
counsel, but we cannot help pointing out that a miscarriage of justice may 
sometimes result by force of circumstances. In such cases, any capital doubt 
should be resolved in favor of the accused.<br><br>My vote, therefore, is to 
reverse the appealed judgment and to release the appellant immediately as he has 
been in prison since November 11, 1947.</p></div>
