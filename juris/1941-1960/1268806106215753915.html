				G.R. No. L-1605, September 13, 1949</h4>
				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF INTESTATE ESTATE OF MARCELINO BELMONTE. APOLONIA JIMOGA-ON, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. JULITA AND ULPIANO, BOTH SURNAMED BELMONTE, MOVANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance 
of Negros Occidental dated June 23, 1947, in relation to the order of July 12, 
1947, appointing the herein petitioner-appellee, Apolonia Jimoga-on, as judicial 
administratrix of the estate of Marcelino Belmonte, who died intestate, and 
failing (<i>a</i>) to adjudge the herein movants-appellants, Julita and Ulpiano 
Belmonte, to be acknowledged natural children of Marcelino Belmonte and 
(<i>b</i>) to appoint Julita Belmonte as administratrix of the properties 
acquired by the deceased Marcelino Belmonte before his marriage to Apolonia 
Jimoga-on.
<p align="justify">Under section 6 of Rule of Court No. 79, the surviving spouse 
is the first in the order of preference for appointment as administrator; and 
the appealed order, it goes without saying, is in consonance with this 
reglementary provision. It is not pretended that Apolonia Jimoga-on is 
unsuitable or otherwise disqualified.</p>
<p align="justify">Even having in view the rule that the order of preference is 
based on the interest which the appointee has in the estate left by the 
deceased, we are inclined to hold that the herein appellee is still to be 
preferred because, according to the appealed order—and the appellants do not 
contend otherwise,—the greater part of the estate left by the deceased Marcelino 
Belmonte was acquired during his marriage to the appellee. This is not a case 
where the whole of the estate to be under administration has been acquired 
before marriage, nor a case where those opposing the appointment (as appellants 
herein) have a greater Interest.</p>
<p align="justify">Even assuming that the properties acquired before the marriage 
are more than those amassed during the period of the conjugal partnership, the 
appealed judgment is still tenable, because the six legitimate children are 
agreeable to the appointment of the appellee, as against only the two appellants 
who claim to be acknowledged natural children. The interest of the legitimate 
children is undoubtedly far greater than the participation that may accrue to 
the alleged natural children.</p>
<p align="justify">The appellants also argue that the lower court erred in not 
making an adjudication to the effect that they are acknowledged natural children 
of the deceased Marcelino Belmonte. This argument is without merit. In the first 
place, as pointed out in the appealed order of July 12, 1947, the matter so far 
taken up by the lower court was limited to the appointment of the judicial 
administratrix of the estate of Marcelino Belmonte. In other words, while no 
adjudication was made on the status of the appellants, this fact does not 
preclude future action on the point. In the second place, while the jurisdiction 
of the probate court includes the power to entertain the question of whether or 
not a person is a natural child acknowledged by the decedent (Conde vs. Abaya, 
13 Phil., 249; Severino vs. Severino, 44 Phil., 343; Lopez vs. Lopez, 37 Off. 
Gaz., 3091), it is only aften, and not before, the payment of all debts, funeral 
charges, expenses of administration, allowance to the widow, and inheritance tax 
shall have been effected that the court should make a declaration of heirs or of 
such persons as are entitled by law to the residue. (Moran, Comments on the 
Rules of Court, 2nd ed., Vol. II, p. 397, citing Capistrano vs. Nadurata, 49 
Phil., 726; Lopez vs. Lopez, 37 Off. Gaz., 3091.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>) The adjudication sought to be obtained by 
the appellants is therefore premature.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the appealed orders are affirmed, and it is so 
ordered with costs against the appellants.</p>

Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur. </p>
