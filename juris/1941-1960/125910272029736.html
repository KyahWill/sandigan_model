<p>On March 19, 1947, the Pacific Trading Corporation, as principal, andt the Manila Surety  and Fidelity Co., Inc., as surety, hereinafter referred to  as the taxpayer and the surety, respectively, executed, in favor of the Republic of    the  Philippines a bond stating that the taxpayer had a pending tax liability, in favor of the Bureau of  Internal Revenue, amounting to P52,8?3.43, as percentage tax and surcharge and as  commercial broker's percentage tax corresponding to the  period from the 1st to the  3rd  quarters of 1946,  plus P100.00 as  compromise; that, upon request of  the  taxpayer,  the  Government  had "agreed to the settlement of said  tax obligation by installment,  P13,933.43 as first installment, and the balance of P39,000.00 payable in  six equal  monthly installments of P6,500.00 * * * beginning April, 1947," that the Government  had  required the taxpayer to file a bond  for P39,000 to secure  the payment of said installments; and that, accordingly,  said corporation and the surety bound  themselves, jointly and severally, in favor of the Government  in the  aforementioned sum of P39,000, to be paid in the manner above stated.</p>
<p>On August 28,  1951,  the Government instituted Civil Case No.  14572 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, against the  taxpayer and  .the surety for  the  recovery under  said bond, of the sum of P26,000.00, representing the balance of the aforementioned tax liability, which said defendants allegedly  refused  to pay,  despite  repeated demands.  Apart from pleading release, based upon some alleged extensions and modifications of the original agreement between the Government and the taxpayer, the surety set  up, in its answer,  a cross-claim against the latter, and a third-party complaint  against  A. M. Rosado and Paul Miraflores, as alleged counter guarantors.  On December 18, 1952, the case was dismissed  without prejudice, owing to inaction of the parties, but, soon  later, or on January 7, 1953, it was reinstated on  motion of the plaintiff.  By an  order of said court,  presided  over  by Hon. Froilan Bayona,  Judge, dated March 16,  1956,  the record was forwarded to the  "Board of Tax Appeals"  (referring to the Court of Tax Appeals)  "for proper proceeding," upon the ground that  the  case fell within the jurisdiction of said board.</p>
<p>On or about November 7,1916, the third-party defendants moved that  the  third-party  complaint  against  them  be dismissed. By resolution, dated December 27, 1956,  the motion was denied by the Court of Tax Appeals.  Meanwhile,  or on November  16, 1956,  the taxpayer  had filed its answer to the complaint,  alleging mainly that its present management "is  without knowledge or information sufficient to  form a belief as to the truth of the allegations' thereof and, accordingly,  denying  said  allegations.  On May 27,  1958,  the taxpayer filed an  amended answer alleging,  <em>inter alia,</em> by  way of  special and affirmative defense, that plaintiff's cause of action  is barred by  the statute of limitations.  By a resolution dated November 11, 1958, the Court of Tax Appeals held that it had no jurisdiction to hear and decide the case and remanded the record thereof "to the Court of origin for  its final  disposition." A reconsideration of this resolution having been  denied, th? issue has been brought to us by petition  for a writ of certiorari and mandamus with  preliminary injunction filed by the plaintiff in the main case.</p>
<p>The only question for determination in  this  case  is whether the same falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of  Tax  Appeals.  Section 7  of  Republic  Act No.  1125 partly provides that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The Court  of Tax Appeals shall exercise exclusive  appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal, as herein providedâ€”</p>
  <p>(1) <em>Decisions</em> of the Collector of Internal Revenue in  cases involving <em>disputed</em> assessments, refunds  of internal revenue  taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue." (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to  section 22 of said  Act:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All cases involving <em>disputed</em> assessment of Internal Revenue taxes or customs duties pending determination before the Court of First Instance shall  be certified and  remanded by the respective clerk of court to the Court of Tax Appeals for final disposition thereof." (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present action does not come under any of the cases enumerated in the foregoing provisions.   It involves neither a <em>disputed</em> assessment nor a <em>decision</em> of the Commissioner of  Internal Revenue.  It is  an  ordinary  action  for the collection of a sum of  money, representing the  unpaid balance of  a tax liability <em>the existence of which is acknowledged</em> in the bond above mentioned, which guarantees its payment.  As held in Republic <em>vs</em>. Vda. de Del Rosario, et al.,  (105 Phil., 277; 57 Off. Gaz. [31] 5543) and Uy Ham <em>vs</em>. Republic, et al., G. R. No. L-13809  (October 20, 1959) the cause of action  of petitioner herein is within  the exclusive original jurisdiction of courts of first instance, and cannot be entertained by the Court of Tax Appeals.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the resolution appealed from is  hereby affirmed,  without  costs.  It is  so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes J. B. L., Barrera,  Gutierrez David, Paredes,</em> and <em>Dizon, JJ.,</em> concur. </p>
