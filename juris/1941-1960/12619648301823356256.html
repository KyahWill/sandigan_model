				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">There is&nbsp; no&nbsp; dispute as&nbsp; to the following facts: on&nbsp; December 13,&nbsp; 1952, Atty.&nbsp; Tranquilino F. Cachero boarded a Yellow Taxicab,&nbsp; with plate No.&nbsp; 2159-52 driven by Gregorio&nbsp; Mira Abinion&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; owned&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp; the Manila&nbsp; Yellow&nbsp; Taxicab&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp; On passing Oroquieta between Doroteo Jose&nbsp; and&nbsp; Lope de&nbsp; Vega streets,&nbsp; Gregorio&nbsp; Mira Abinibn bumped said taxicab against a Meralco post,. No. 1-4/387, with&nbsp; the result that the cab was badly&nbsp; smashed and the plaintiff fell out&nbsp; of the&nbsp; vehicle to&nbsp; the ground, suffering thereby physical injuries, <i>slight in nature</i>. <br><br>The chauffeur was subsequently prosecuted by the City Ifiscal and on&nbsp; February 26, 1953, upon his plea of guilty the Municipal&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Manila&nbsp; sentenced&nbsp; him to suffer 1 month and 1 day&nbsp; of <i>arresto mayor</i>, and to pay the costs. <br><br>On&nbsp; December&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; Tranquilino&nbsp; F.&nbsp; Cachero&nbsp; addressed a letter to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Manila Yellow Taxicab Co.,&nbsp; Inc., which was followed by another of January 6, 1953, which reads&nbsp; as follows: <br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 360px;">"Manila, <i>January 6, 1953</i><br></div> <br>The MANILA YELLOW TAXICAK CO., INC. <br>1338 Arlegui, Manila<br><br>Dear Sirs: <br><br>As you have been already advised* by the letter dated December 17,&nbsp; 1952, on December 13,&nbsp; 1952, while&nbsp; I was a passenger of your taxieab bearing plate No. 2159 and driven by your chauffeur Gregorio Mira and through his&nbsp; negligence and the bad condition of the said car, he bumped the same against&nbsp;&nbsp; the pavement on the&nbsp;&nbsp; street (Oroquieta—between Doroteo Jose and Lope de Vega streets, Manila) and hit the Meralco post on said street, resulting in the smashing of the&nbsp; said taxicab,&nbsp; and as&nbsp; a result thereof I was gravely injured and suffered&nbsp; and is&nbsp; still&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering physical,&nbsp; mental&nbsp; and&nbsp; moral damages&nbsp; and not being able to resume&nbsp; any&nbsp; daily calling. <br><br>For the said damages, I hereby make a demand for the payment of the sum of P79,245.65, covering&nbsp; expenses for&nbsp; transportation&nbsp; to the hospital for&nbsp; medical treatment,&nbsp; medicines, doctors&nbsp; bills, actual monetary loss, moral,&nbsp; compensatory and&nbsp; exemplary damages,&nbsp; etc, within&nbsp; 5 days from date of receipt hereof. <br><br>I trust to hear from you on the matter within the period of 5 days above specified. &nbsp;<br><br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 480px;">Truly yours, &nbsp;<br></div><blockquote><br><div style="margin-left: 200px;">(Sgd.)&nbsp; TRANQUILINO F.&nbsp; CACHERO <br>2256 Int. B, Misericordia St.<br>Sta. Cruz,&nbsp; Manila" (Exhibit K)</div></blockquote>The Taxicab Co. to avoid expenses and time of litigation offered to&nbsp; settle the case amicably with plaintiff but the latter only agreed&nbsp; to&nbsp; reduce his&nbsp; demand to the sum of P72.050.20 as his only basis for settlement which, of course, was not accepted by said&nbsp; company.&nbsp; So plaintiff instituted this action on February&nbsp; 2,&nbsp; 1953, in&nbsp; the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila, praying in the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; that the defendant&nbsp; be condemned&nbsp; to pay him: • <br><blockquote>"(a) The&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P72,050.20, the total sum of the itemized losses and/or damages&nbsp; under paragraph 7 of the complaint,&nbsp; with legal interest thereon from the&nbsp; date of&nbsp; the filing&nbsp; of the complaint; <br>(b) The sum of P5,000 as&nbsp; attorney's fee; and the costa of&nbsp; the suit; and <br>Plaintiff further&nbsp; respectfully prays for such other and further reliefs as the facts and the law pertaining to&nbsp; the case may&nbsp; warrant." </blockquote>The&nbsp; defendant answered&nbsp; the complaint&nbsp; setting forth affirmative&nbsp; defenses;&nbsp; and a&nbsp; counterclaim&nbsp; for&nbsp; P930&nbsp; as damages and praying for the dismissal of plaintiff's action. After&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; rendered decision&nbsp; only July 20, 1954, the dispositive part of&nbsp; which is as follows: <br><blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff and&nbsp; against the defendant, sentencing&nbsp; the latter to pay the former the&nbsp; following: (1)&nbsp; For medicine, doctor's fees for services rendered and&nbsp; transportation, P700;&nbsp; (2) professional fee as&nbsp; attorney for the defendant in&nbsp; Criminal Case&nbsp; No. 364, 'People vs. Manolo Maddela et&nbsp; al. of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Nueva Vizeaya, P3,000;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; professional&nbsp; fees as attorney Tor the defendant in Civil Case No. 23891 of the Municipal Court of Manila, 'Virginia Tangulan vs. Leonel&nbsp; da Silva,' and for the taking of the deposition of Gabina Angrepan in a case&nbsp; against the Philippine National Bank, P200; and&nbsp; (4) moral damages iri'idie amount of P2,000. </blockquote>Defendant's countercl4im. is hereby;&nbsp; dismissed. <br>Defendant shall&nbsp; also&nbsp; pay the costs." <br>From this decision both parties appealed to Us, plaintiff ¦ limiting his appeal to the part of the decision which refers to the moral damages awarded to 'him which&nbsp; he considered inadequate, and to. the failure of said&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; to grant the attorney's fees asked for in the prayer of his complaint. Defendant in turn alleges that the trial&nbsp; Court erred&nbsp; in awarding to the plaintiff the following: <br><blockquote>"(1) P700—for&nbsp; medicine,&nbsp; doctor's&nbsp; fees and&nbsp; transportation expenses; <br>(2) P3,000—as supposedly unearned full professional fees as&nbsp; attorney for the defendant in Criminal Case No. 364, 'People&nbsp; vs. Manob Maddela et al.; <br>(3) P200—as supposedly unearned professional fees as attorney for the defendant in Civil Case No. 23891 of the Manila Municipal Court, 'Virginia&nbsp; Tangrulan vs. Leonel&nbsp; de Silva',&nbsp; and for failure to take the deposition&nbsp; of a certain Gabina Angrepah in&nbsp; an unnamed case; and<br>(4). P2,000—as moral damages,&nbsp; amounting to the grand&nbsp; total of P5,900, these amounts being very much greater&nbsp; than what&nbsp; plaintiff deserves."</blockquote> In&nbsp; connection with his appeal,&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; calls&nbsp; attention to&nbsp; the&nbsp; testimonies of Dr. Modesto S.&nbsp; Purisima&nbsp; and&nbsp; of Dr. Francisco&nbsp; Aguilar,&nbsp;&nbsp; a member of&nbsp; the staff&nbsp; of the National Orthopedic Hospital, which he considers necessary as&nbsp; a basis for ascertaining&nbsp; not only&nbsp; the physical sufferings undergone by him, but also for determining the&nbsp; adequate compensation&nbsp; for&nbsp; moral damages that&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; should&nbsp; be awarded&nbsp; by reason of&nbsp; said&nbsp; accident. <br><br>The&nbsp; exact nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff's injuries, their&nbsp; degree of&nbsp; seriousness and the period of&nbsp; his involuntary disability&nbsp; can be&nbsp; determined by the medical certificate&nbsp; (Exhibit D) issued by the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Orthopedic Hospital on&nbsp; December 16,&nbsp; 1952,&nbsp; and the testimonies&nbsp; of Dr. Francisco Aguilar, physician&nbsp; in said hospital, and of Dr. Modesto Purisima, a private practitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; The medical&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; (Exhibit D)&nbsp; lists:&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; a&nbsp; <i>subluxation</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; the right shoulder joint; (b) a <i>contusion</i> on the right chest; and (c) a "suspicious fracture"&nbsp; of the upper&nbsp; end of&nbsp; the&nbsp; right humerus.&nbsp; Dr. Aguilar who issued the&nbsp; medical&nbsp; certificate admitted, however, with regard to the&nbsp; "suspicious fracture", that in his opinion with (the&nbsp; aid&nbsp; of),&nbsp; the x-ray there was&nbsp; no fricttlre.&nbsp; According to&nbsp; this doctor plaintiff went to the'<br><br>National&nbsp; Orthopedic Hospital&nbsp; at&nbsp; least&nbsp; six&nbsp; times during the period from December 16, 1952, to April 7, 1953; that he strapped&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; body&nbsp; (see Exhibit K),&nbsp; which&nbsp; strap was not removed until after&nbsp; a period of six weeks&nbsp; had elapsed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr, Modesto&nbsp; Purisima,&nbsp; a private&nbsp; practitioner, testified&nbsp; that he <i>advised</i> and&nbsp; <i>treated</i> plaintiff&nbsp; from&nbsp; December&nbsp; 14, 1952, to&nbsp; the end of March&nbsp; (1953),&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff was never hospitalized for&nbsp; treatment of&nbsp; the injuries he received&nbsp; in said accident.<br><br>Counsel for the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; delves 'quite&nbsp; extensively on these&nbsp; injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; says&nbsp; in&nbsp; his brief the following: <br><blockquote>"Just what is a subluxation?&nbsp; <i>Luxation</i> is another term for dis- location (Dorland, W.A.N., The&nbsp; American Illustrated Medical&nbsp; Dictionary (13th ed.)3 P- 652), and hence, a <i>subluxation</i> is an incomplete or partial <i>dislocation</i>&nbsp; (Ibid., p.&nbsp; 1115).&nbsp;&nbsp; While a dislocation&nbsp; is the displacement of a&nbsp; bone&nbsp; or bones from&nbsp; its&nbsp; or&nbsp; their normal setting (and, therefore, applicable and&nbsp; occurs only to joints&nbsp; and not&nbsp; to rigid or non-movable parts of the skeletal&nbsp; system)&nbsp; (Ibid., p.&nbsp; 358; Christopher, P., A Textbook- of Surgery (5th ed.),.p.&nbsp; 342), it should be distinguished from a fracture which,&nbsp; is a&nbsp; break&nbsp; or&nbsp; rupture&nbsp; in a bone or cartilage, usually due&nbsp; to external violence (Christopher, F., A Textbook of&nbsp; Surgery (5th&nbsp; ed.), p. 194; Dorland, W.A.N., The American&nbsp; Illustrated Mediical Dictionary&nbsp; (13th ed.), p.&nbsp; 459),&nbsp; Because, unlike <i>fractures</i> which may be partial (a crack in the bone) or total (a complete break in&nbsp; the bone),&nbsp; there can be no halfway situations with regard&nbsp; to&nbsp; dislocations&nbsp; of the shoulder&nbsp; joint, (the head or ball of the humerus—the humerus is the bone from, the elbow&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; shoulder)&nbsp; must&nbsp; be either&nbsp; inside the&nbsp; socket of&nbsp; the scapula or shoulder blade&nbsp; (in which case there is no&nbsp; dislocation) or put of&nbsp; the latter&nbsp; (in&nbsp; which&nbsp; event&nbsp; there is&nbsp; a dislocation),&nbsp; to denote&nbsp; a&nbsp; condition where due to&nbsp; external violence,&nbsp; the muscles and ligaments&nbsp; connecting the&nbsp; Giunierus&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; scapula have subjected to strain&nbsp; intense&nbsp; enough&nbsp; to&nbsp; produce temporary distension or less sening of&nbsp; their tautness and feonsequently resulting in the loosening' or wrenching of the ball of the&nbsp; humerus from its snug fit&nbsp; in. the socket&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; scapula,&nbsp; by&nbsp; using the terms&nbsp; subluxation or partial dislocation (as, used in the medical certificate), is&nbsp; to fall into a misnomer—a term often used&nbsp; by 'chiropractors' and by those who would&nbsp; want to sound impressive, hut&nbsp; generally unfavored by the medical profession. To describe&nbsp; the above condition more aptly, the&nbsp; medical ¦ profession&nbsp; usually employs the&nbsp; expression <i>luxatio imperfecta</i>, or, in simple language,&nbsp; a sprain (Dorland, W.A.N., The American Illustrated Medical&nbsp; Dictionary&nbsp; (13th ed.)&gt;&nbsp; p. 652).&nbsp; The condition we have&nbsp; described is a paraphrase&nbsp; of the definition of&nbsp; a sprain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff suffered this very injury (a sprained or wrenched&nbsp; . shoulder joint) and a cursory&nbsp; scrutiny of&nbsp; his x-ray plates&nbsp; (Exhibits A and B)&nbsp; by&nbsp; a qualified orthopedic surgeon&nbsp; or by a layman with a picture or x-ray plate of a normal&nbsp; shoulder&nbsp; joint&nbsp; (found&nbsp; in any standard textbook on human anatomy;&nbsp; the one we used was Scheffer, J.P., Morris' Human Anatomy (10 ed., p. 194)&nbsp; far comparison will bear&nbsp; out our&nbsp; claim. <br><br>Treatment for&nbsp; a&nbsp; sprain in by&nbsp; the use of&nbsp; adhesive&nbsp; or&nbsp; elastic bandage, elevation of the joint, heat,&nbsp; effteurage and!&nbsp; later massage&nbsp; , (Christopher, F.,&nbsp; A Textbook of&nbsp; Surgery&nbsp; (5th- ed.,&nbsp; p. 116).&nbsp; The treatment&nbsp; given to the plaintiff was just exactly that&nbsp; Dr. Aguilar bandaged (strapped) plaintiff's right&nbsp; shoulder&nbsp; and chest&nbsp; (t.s.n,, p. 31)&nbsp; in&nbsp; an&nbsp; elevated&nbsp; position&nbsp; (with the&nbsp; forearm horizontal&nbsp; to&nbsp; the ' chest&nbsp; (see&nbsp; photograph,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; E),&nbsp; and certain&nbsp; vitamins were prescribed&nbsp; for&nbsp; him&nbsp; (t.s.n., p. 131).&nbsp; He also&nbsp; underwent massage for some time by&nbsp; Drs. Aguilar and&nbsp; Purisima.&nbsp; The&nbsp; medicines and appurtenances&nbsp; to&nbsp; treatment purchased by plaintiff from the Orthopedic Hospital, Botica&nbsp; Boie and Metro Drug Store were, by his own admission, adhesive plaster, bandlage, gauze, oil and 'tintura' arnica' (t.s,n.,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 3—continuation of&nbsp; transcript),&nbsp; and Dr.&nbsp; Purisima also prescribed 'Numotizin', a heat generating&nbsp; ointment&nbsp; (t.s.n.,&nbsp; p. 23), all of which are&nbsp; indicated for a&nbsp; sprain, and&nbsp; by their nature,&nbsp; can cure&nbsp; nothing more serious than a sprain&nbsp; anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fractures and true&nbsp; dislocations&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; cured by the kind&nbsp; of treatment and " medicines which plaintiff received.&nbsp; A true dislocation, for instance, is treated&nbsp; by means of reduction&nbsp; through traction of the arm until the&nbsp; humeral head returns to the proper position&nbsp; in the scapular' socket&nbsp; (pulling the arm at a 60 degree&nbsp; angle&nbsp; and&nbsp; guiding the ball of the humerus into proper position, in its socket) while the patient is under deep&nbsp; anaesthesia, and then, completely immobilizing the part&nbsp; until&nbsp; the&nbsp; injured&nbsp; capsule&nbsp; has&nbsp; healed&nbsp;&nbsp; (Christopher, F., A Textbook of Surgery, pp. 343&nbsp; and 344).&nbsp; No evidence was submitted that&nbsp; plaintiff ever received the latter&nbsp; kind of&nbsp; treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Purisima even declared that after the plaintiff's first visit to&nbsp; the Orthopedic Hospital&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter informed him that&nbsp; <i>there was no fracture or dislocation</i>&nbsp; (t.s.n., p. 26).&nbsp; Dr. Purisima's statement is the truth of the matter&nbsp; as we have already explained—joints of the shoulder being only&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to total&nbsp; dislocation&nbsp; (due&nbsp; to their&nbsp; anatomical design), not to partial&nbsp; ones, and any&nbsp; injury approximating&nbsp; dislocation but not&nbsp; completely, it being classified&nbsp; as&nbsp; mere&nbsp; aprains, slight or bad.<br><br>The second and last&nbsp; injury plaintiff&nbsp; sustained&nbsp; was a&nbsp; contusion. What is&nbsp; a contusion?&nbsp; It is&nbsp; just a&nbsp; high&nbsp; flown&nbsp; expression for a bruise&nbsp; or the act of bruising&nbsp;&nbsp; (Dorland,&nbsp; W.A.N., The&nbsp; American Illustrated Medical Dictionary (13th ed., p. 290):&nbsp; No further discussion need&nbsp; be&nbsp; made&nbsp; on this particular injury&nbsp; since the&nbsp; nature of a bruise is of common knowledge&nbsp; (it's&nbsp; a bit uncomfortable but not disabling&nbsp; unless it&nbsp; occurs on&nbsp; movable parts&nbsp; like the&nbsp; finders or elbow, which is not the case herein having occurred in the right chest)&nbsp; and the kind of medical&nbsp; treatment or&nbsp; help&nbsp; it deserves&nbsp; is also well known."&nbsp; (pp.&nbsp; 10-14, defendant-appellant's brief). </blockquote>The trial Judge undoubtedly did&nbsp; not give&nbsp; much&nbsp; value to the&nbsp; testimonies of the doctors&nbsp; when in&nbsp; the statement of facts made&nbsp; in his decision he referred to the&nbsp; physical injuries received&nbsp; by the plaintiff <i>as&nbsp; slight in&nbsp; nature</i> and the latter is estopped from discussing the same&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to make them&nbsp; appear&nbsp; as serious, because in the statement of&nbsp; facts made in&nbsp; his brief as appellant,&nbsp; he says&nbsp; the following: <br><blockquote>"The facts of the case as found by. the lower court in its decision, with the&nbsp; permission of this Honorable Court, <i>we respectfully quote them hereunder as our&nbsp; STATEMENT OF&nbsp; FACTS</i> for the purpose of this appeal." </blockquote>Before&nbsp; entering into&nbsp; a&nbsp; discussion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the merits&nbsp; of plaintiff's&nbsp; appeal,&nbsp; We&nbsp; will&nbsp; say&nbsp; a few&nbsp; words as to&nbsp; the nature of the&nbsp; action&nbsp; on&nbsp; which his&nbsp; demand for&nbsp; damages is predicated. <br><blockquote>"The nature of an action as in contract&nbsp; or in tort is determined from the essential elements of the complaint, taken as a&nbsp; whole,&nbsp; in the ease&nbsp; of doubt a construction&nbsp; to sustain the action 'being1 given to it, <br><br>While the prayer for&nbsp; relief or measure&nbsp; of damages sought does not necessarily determine&nbsp; the character of the&nbsp; action, it may be material&nbsp; in the determination&nbsp; the question and&nbsp; therefore entitled to consideration&nbsp; and in&nbsp; cases of doubt will often determine the character of the action and indeed there are actions whose character is&nbsp; necessarily determined thereby."&nbsp;&nbsp; (1&nbsp; C.J.S.&nbsp; 1100) </blockquote>A mere perusal of&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; will show that his action against the defendant is predicated on an alleged breach&nbsp; of&nbsp; contract&nbsp; of carriage,&nbsp; i.e., the&nbsp; failure of&nbsp; the defendant to&nbsp; bring&nbsp; him&nbsp; "safely and without mishaps" to his destination, and it is to be noted that the chauffeur of defendant's taxicab that plaintiff used when he received the injuries involved herein,&nbsp; Gregorio Mira, has&nbsp; not even been&nbsp; made a party&nbsp; defendant to this case. <br><br>Considering,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; the nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; plaintiff's action in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case,&nbsp; is&nbsp; he&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; for&nbsp; moral damages?&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 2219&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil&nbsp;&nbsp; Code&nbsp; says&nbsp; the following: <br><blockquote>"Art. 2219. Moral damages may&nbsp; be recovered in the following and analogous cases: <br><blockquote>(1) A&nbsp; criminal offense&nbsp; resulting in physical&nbsp; injuries; <br>(2) Quasi-delicts causing physical injuries; <br>(3) Seduction, abduction, ¦ rape, or other lascivious acts; <br>(4) Adultery or concubinage; <br>(5) Illegal or arbitrary&nbsp; detention or arrest; <br>(6) Illegal search; <br>(7) Libel, slander or any other&nbsp; form&nbsp; of defamation; <br>(8) Malicious&nbsp; prosecution; <br>(9) Acts mentioned in&nbsp; Article 309; <br>(10) Acts and actions referred to in- Articles&nbsp; 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,&nbsp; 32, 34 and&nbsp; 35.</blockquote></blockquote> <center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>" Of the&nbsp; cases enumerated in the just quoted Article 2219. only&nbsp; the&nbsp; first two may&nbsp; have any bearing on the ease at bar.&nbsp; We find, however, with regard to the first that the defendant herein has not committed&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with this case&nbsp; any&nbsp; "criminal offense resulting in physical injuries".&nbsp;&nbsp; The one that&nbsp; committed the offense against the plaintiff&nbsp; is .Gregorio&nbsp; Mira, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; is why he has been already prosecuted and&nbsp; punished&nbsp; therefor.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; (a) owners and&nbsp; managers of&nbsp; an establishment&nbsp; or&nbsp; enterprise are responsible for&nbsp; damages caused by&nbsp; their&nbsp; employees in the&nbsp; service&nbsp; of the branches in which the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; are employed&nbsp; or' on&nbsp; the occasion&nbsp; of their&nbsp; functions;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) employers are&nbsp; likewise&nbsp; liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages&nbsp;&nbsp; caused by their&nbsp; employees and&nbsp; household helpers acting&nbsp; within&nbsp; the scope;&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; assigned task&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 2180 of the Civil Code) ;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; employers&nbsp; and&nbsp; corporations&nbsp; engaged m any&nbsp; kind&nbsp; of industry are&nbsp; subsidiarily&nbsp; civilly liable for felonies committed by their employees in the&nbsp; discharge of their duties&nbsp; (Art.&nbsp; 103,&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code),&nbsp; plaintiff herein does&nbsp; not maintain this&nbsp; action under the provisions of any&nbsp; of the&nbsp; articles&nbsp; of the&nbsp; codes just&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; and against&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons who&nbsp; might'&nbsp; be&nbsp; liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; the damages&nbsp; caused,&nbsp; but&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result of an admitted&nbsp; breach of contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; carriage&nbsp;&nbsp; and against the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; employer alone.&nbsp; We,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at&nbsp; bar does not&nbsp;&nbsp; come&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; exception&nbsp; of&nbsp; paragraph 1, Article&nbsp; 2219&nbsp; of the Civil Code. <br><br>The present complaint&nbsp; is&nbsp; not based either on a "quasi-delict' causing; physical injuries"&nbsp; (Art. 2219, par. 2, of the Civil Code).&nbsp; From the&nbsp; report&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; Commission on the new Civil&nbsp; Code We copy the following: <br><br>"A question of&nbsp; nomenclature confronted the Commission,&nbsp; After a&nbsp; careful' deliberation, it&nbsp; was agreed to use the term 'quasi-delict' fo those obligations&nbsp; <i>which do not arise from law,.contracts, quasi-contracts, or&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; offenses</i>. , They are&nbsp;&nbsp; known in&nbsp; Spanish legal treatises&nbsp; as <i>'culpa&nbsp; aquiliana',. 'culpa-extra-contractual'&nbsp; or&nbsp; 'cuasi-delitos'</i>.&nbsp; The&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; 'culpa-extra-contractual'&nbsp; or its translation 'extra-rcontractual&nbsp; fault* was&nbsp; eliminated because it did not&nbsp; exclude quasi-contractual or&nbsp; penal obligations.&nbsp; 'Aquilian fault' might have been selected, but&nbsp; it&nbsp; was thought inadvisable to refer to so&nbsp; ancient a law as the&nbsp; 'Lex&nbsp; Aquilia'.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 'quasi-delicts' was chosen, which more nearly corresponds to the Roman Law classification of obliga tions, and is in harmony with the nature of this kind of&nbsp; liability." <br><br>"The Commission also thought of the possibility of&nbsp; adopting the word 'tort-' from Anglo-Ameriean law.&nbsp; But&nbsp; tort' under that system is&nbsp; much broader than the Spanish-Philippine concept&nbsp; of obligations arising from non-contractual&nbsp; negligence.&nbsp; 'Tort' in Anglo-American jurisprudence includes&nbsp; not&nbsp; only negligence,&nbsp; but&nbsp; also- intentional criminal acts, such' as&nbsp; assault "and battery,' false imprisonment&nbsp; and deceit. In&nbsp; the general plan&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine legal system, ' intentional&nbsp; and malicious acts&nbsp; are&nbsp; governed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code, although certain exceptions are made in the Project."&nbsp; (Report of the Code Commission, pp. 161-162). <br><br>In the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Cangeo vs. Manila Railroad,&nbsp; 38 Phil. 768,&nbsp; We&nbsp; established the distinction between obligation&nbsp; derived&nbsp; from negligence and&nbsp; obligation as&nbsp; a result of&nbsp; a breach&nbsp; of a contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, We said: <br><blockquote>"It is important to note that the foundation of the legal liability of the defendant is the contract of carriage, and that the obligation to respond&nbsp; for&nbsp; the damage which plaintiff&nbsp; has suffered arises,&nbsp; if at all, from the breach&nbsp; of&nbsp; that contract' by reason of the failure of defendant to exercise due&nbsp; care in its performance.&nbsp; That is&nbsp; to say, <blockquote>its liability is direct and immediate, differing&nbsp; essentially. in the legal&nbsp; viewipoint&nbsp; from&nbsp; that&nbsp; presumptive&nbsp; responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; the negligence&nbsp; of its servants, imposed by Article 1903 of the Civil Code (Art.&nbsp; 2180&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; new), which can&nbsp; be rebutted by proof of the exercise of&nbsp; due&nbsp; care in their selection or supervision.&nbsp; Article 1903 is&nbsp; not&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; to&nbsp; obligatiovis a rising&nbsp; EX&nbsp; CONTRACTU,&nbsp; hut only to extra-contractual obligations—or&nbsp; to use&nbsp; the technical&nbsp; form&nbsp; of expression,&nbsp; that article relates only to culpa </blockquote>AQUILIANA&nbsp; and not fO CULPA&nbsp; CONTRACTUAL,.</blockquote>" The decisions&nbsp; in the cases of Castro&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Aero Taxicab ¦ (82 Phil.,&nbsp; 359, 46 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., No. 5, p. 2023) ; Lilius et al. vs. Manila Railroad, (59 Phil. 758)&nbsp; and others, wherein moral damages were awarded to the&nbsp; plaintiffs, are&nbsp; not&nbsp; applicable to the case&nbsp; at bar because&nbsp; said decisions were rendered before the eft'ectivity&nbsp; of the new Civil Code (August&nbsp; 30, 1950)&nbsp; and for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; further&nbsp; reason that&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaints filed therein&nbsp; were&nbsp; based on&nbsp; different&nbsp; causes&nbsp; of&nbsp; action. <br><br>In&nbsp; view of the&nbsp; foregoing the sum of P2,000 awarded as moral damages&nbsp; by&nbsp; the trial Court has to be eliminated, for under the law it&nbsp; is&nbsp; not a compensation awardable&nbsp; in a&nbsp; case&nbsp; like&nbsp; the&nbsp; one&nbsp; at bar. <br><br>As to plaintiff's demand for&nbsp; P5,000&nbsp; as&nbsp; attorney's fees, the Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; provides the&nbsp; following: <br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 2208. In the absence of&nbsp; stipulation,&nbsp; attorney's .fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, <i>except</i>: <br><blockquote>(1) When exemplary&nbsp; damages are awarded; <br>(2) When&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant's act&nbsp; or omission has compelled&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; to litigate with third&nbsp; persons&nbsp; or to incur&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; to protect his&nbsp; interest; <br>(3) In criminal&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of malicious&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; against&nbsp; the plaintiff;<br>(4) In case&nbsp; of a clearly&nbsp; unfounded civil action or proceeding against&nbsp; the plaintiff; <br>(5) Where the defendant&nbsp; acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to&nbsp; satisfy the plaintiff's plainly&nbsp; valid, just and&nbsp; demandable claim; <br>(6) In actions&nbsp; for legal support; <br>(7) In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled&nbsp; workers; <br>(8) In actions for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability&nbsp; laws; <br>(9) In a separate civil action to recover civil&nbsp; liability arising from&nbsp; a&nbsp; crime; <br>(10) When&nbsp; at least double&nbsp; judicial costs are awarded; <br>(11) In any&nbsp; other&nbsp; case where the&nbsp; court&nbsp; deems&nbsp; it just and equitable that&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees and&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; of litigation&nbsp; should be recovered. </blockquote></blockquote>In all cases, the attorney's fees&nbsp; and expenses of litigation must be&nbsp; reasonable." <br><br>The present case does&nbsp; not come under any&nbsp; of the exceptions&nbsp; enumerated&nbsp; in the preceding&nbsp; article,&nbsp; specially of&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 2&nbsp; thereof,&nbsp;&nbsp; because&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to ' meet its&nbsp; responsibility was not&nbsp; the&nbsp; canse that compelled the plaintiff to litigate or to incur&nbsp; expenses to&nbsp; protect his interests.&nbsp; The&nbsp; present&nbsp; action&nbsp; was&nbsp; instituted&nbsp; because plaintiff demanded&nbsp; an exorbitant&nbsp; amount for&nbsp; moral damages&nbsp; (P60,000)&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; naturally the&nbsp; defendant did not and&nbsp; could not yield to such&nbsp; demand.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is neither&nbsp; a case&nbsp; that comes under paragraph&nbsp; 11 of Article 2208 because the Lower Court did not deem it just&nbsp; and equitable to award any amount for attorney's&nbsp; fees.&nbsp;&nbsp; As We&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; Judge on,this point,&nbsp; We cannot declare that he erred for&nbsp; not&nbsp; awarding&nbsp; to plaintiff&nbsp; any such fees&nbsp; in this case.<br><br>Coming now to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal of the defendant,&nbsp; the Court, after&nbsp; due&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; appearing&nbsp; on record: <br><br>(1) Approves the award of P700 for medicine, doctors' fees and transportation&nbsp; expenses;<br>(2) Reduces&nbsp; the&nbsp; award of P3,000&nbsp; as&nbsp; attorney's fees to the&nbsp; sum of P2,000,&nbsp; as Manolo&nbsp; Maddela, defendant in Criminal&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 364&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Nueva&nbsp; Vizcaya&nbsp; testified&nbsp; that, he has&nbsp; already&nbsp; paid to plaintiff&nbsp; part of&nbsp; the latter'a&nbsp; fees&nbsp; of P3,000,&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; which&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; disclosed,&nbsp; though&nbsp; it&nbsp; was. incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish how&nbsp; much he had been paid of said&nbsp; fees; <br>(3) Approves the&nbsp; award of P200 as&nbsp; unearned professional fees as attorney for&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant in&nbsp; Civil Case No.&nbsp; 238191 of the Municipal&nbsp; Court of Manila whom plaintiff&nbsp; was&nbsp; unable to&nbsp; represent, and&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter's failure to take&nbsp; the deposition&nbsp; of one Agripina&nbsp; Angrepah due to the&nbsp; automobile&nbsp; accident referred to&nbsp; in this case. Before&nbsp; closing&nbsp; this decision We&nbsp; deem&nbsp; it convenient to quote the&nbsp; following&nbsp; passage&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendant's brief&nbsp; as appellant: <br><blockquote>"Realizing its obligation under&nbsp; its contract of carriage with the plaintiff,&nbsp; and because&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; of the&nbsp; case,&nbsp; as have been shown, mark it as more proper for the Municipal Court only, the defendant, to avoid&nbsp; the expense&nbsp; and time of litigation, offered to&nbsp; settle the case&nbsp; amicably with&nbsp; plaintiff, but the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; refused&nbsp; and insisted on his demand&nbsp; for.&nbsp; P72,050.20. (Exhibit&nbsp; K)&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; only&nbsp; basis for settlement, thus adding&nbsp; a clearly petty ease to the&nbsp; already overflowing&nbsp; desk of the Honorable Members of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court.<br><br>We admire and respect at all times a man for standing&nbsp; up and fighting' for his rights,&nbsp; and when said&nbsp; right consists in injuries sustained due to a breach of a contract&nbsp; of carriage with us, sympathy and understanding are' added&nbsp; thereto.&nbsp; But when&nbsp; a person starts demanding&nbsp; P72,050.20&nbsp; for&nbsp; a solitary. bruise and sprain, injuries&nbsp; for&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; court, even&nbsp; at&nbsp; its generous&nbsp; although erroneous best, could only grant P5,900,&nbsp; then respect&nbsp; and&nbsp; sympathy give way to something else.&nbsp; It is time to fight, for&nbsp; in our humble opinion, there is nothing more loathsome nor truly worthy of condemnation than one who uses his injuries for&nbsp; other purposes than just&nbsp; rectification.&nbsp; If plaintiff's&nbsp; claim is&nbsp; granted, it would be&nbsp; a blessing,&nbsp; not a&nbsp; misfortune, to be injured."&nbsp; (p. 34-35). </blockquote>This case was. instituted by a&nbsp; lawyer who, as an&nbsp; officer of the courts, should be the first in helping Us in the administration of justice,&nbsp; and&nbsp; after going over the record of this case, we do&nbsp; not&nbsp; hesitate to&nbsp; say that&nbsp; the&nbsp; demand of P72,050.20 for a subluxation of the right humerus bone and an insignificant contusion&nbsp; in&nbsp; the chest, has not even the semblance&nbsp; of&nbsp; reasonableness.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a matter&nbsp; of&nbsp; fact, Dr. Aguilar himself&nbsp; said&nbsp; that&nbsp; the x-ray&nbsp; plates&nbsp; (Ex- hibits A,&nbsp; B and C)&nbsp; <i>"did not show anything significant</i> except that it&nbsp; shows&nbsp; a slight subluxation of the right shoulder, and that there is a suspicious fracture", which ultimately he&nbsp; admitted not to exist.&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; himself must have&nbsp; felt embarrassed by his own attitude when after&nbsp; receiving defendant's brief&nbsp; as appellant, he makes in his brief as appellee the categorical&nbsp; statement&nbsp; that he "does not now insist not pretend in the least to collect from&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant all the damages he had&nbsp; claimed in his complaint,&nbsp; but instead&nbsp; he is submitting his case to the sound discretion&nbsp; of the Honorable Court&nbsp; for the award of&nbsp; a reasonable and equitable damages allowable by law, to compensate the&nbsp; plaintiff of the suffering&nbsp; and losses he&nbsp; had&nbsp; undergone&nbsp; and&nbsp; incurred because&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accident oftentimes mentioned in this brief in which plaintiff was injured" (p.&nbsp; 17-18).&nbsp; This acknowledgment comes too late,&nbsp; for plaintiff has&nbsp; already deprived the Court of Appeals of&nbsp; the occasion&nbsp; to exercise its appellate&nbsp; jurisdiction over this case which he recklessly&nbsp; dumped to this Court.&nbsp; We&nbsp; certainly cannot look with&nbsp; favor&nbsp; at&nbsp; this attitude of plaintiff. <br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; decision appealed from is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; modified by reducing the amount awarded&nbsp; as unearned professional fees&nbsp; from&nbsp; P3,000&nbsp; to&nbsp; P2,000 and by&nbsp; eliminating the moral damages of P2,000 awarded by the Lower Court to the plaintiff.&nbsp; Said decision is&nbsp; in&nbsp; all other&nbsp; respects affirmed, without&nbsp; pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs. It is so ordered. <br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp;&nbsp; Reyes, A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B.
