				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendants Go Tiong and Luzon Surety  Co. are  appealing from the  decision of  the  Court of First Instance of Manila,  Judge  Magno S. Gatmaitan presiding, the dispositive part of which reads as  follows:<br><blockquote>"In view whereof, judgment  is rendered condemning defendant Go Tiong and Luzon Surety Co., jointly and severally, to pay plaintiff the  sum of P4,920  with legal interest from the date of the  filing of the  complaint until fully paid; judgment is also rendered against Go  Tiong to  pay the sum of  P3,680 unto plaintiff, also with legal interest from the date of the filing of the complaint until fully paid. Go  Tiong is also condemned to pay the sum of P1,000 as attorney's fees, plus costs."</blockquote>The appeal was first taken to the Court of Appeals, the latter indorsing the case to  us later under the provisions of Section 17 (6)  of  Republic  Act No. 296, on the ground that the issues raised were purely questions of law. <br><br>Go Tiong owned a rice mill and  warehouse,  located at Mabini,  Urdaneta, Pangasinan.  On February 4, 1953, he obtained a  license to  engage in  the business of a bonded warehouseman  (Exhibit N).   To  secure the performance of  his  obligations as  such bonded warehouseman,  the Luzon Surety Co.  executed Guaranty Bond No. 294 in the Bum of 118,334 (Exhibit 0), conditioned  particularly  on the fulfillment by Go Tiong of his duly or obligation to deliver to  the depositors in his  storage  warehouse,  the palay received by  him for storage, at any  time demand is made, or to pay ihe market value thereof, in case he was unable  to  return  the same.  The  bond was  executed  on January 26,  1953.  Go Tiong insured the  warehouse and the palay deposited therein with the Alliance Surety and Insurance  Company.                   <br><br>But prior  to the issuance of the license to  Go Tiong to operate as bonded warehouseman, he  had on several occasions received palay for deposit from plaintiff Ramon Gonzales, totalling 368 sacks, for which he issued receipts, Exhibits A, B, C, and D.  After he was licensed as bonded warehouseman,  Go Tiong again received various deliveries of palay from plaintiff,  totalling 492 sacks, for which he issued the  corresponding receipts,  all the deliveries having a grand total of 860 sacks, valued at P8,600 at the rate of P10 per sack. <br><br>On or about March 15, 1953, plaintiff demanded from Go Tiong the value of his deposits in the amount of P8,600, but he was told to return  after two days, which he did, but Go Tiong again told him to come back.  A few days later,  the  warehouse burned  to  the ground.  Before  the lire, Go Tiong had been  accepting deliveries of palay from other  depositors and at the time of the fire, there were 5,847  sacks of palay in the warehouse, in excess of  the 5,000  sacks  authorized  under his  license.  The  receipts issued by Go  Tiong to the plaintiff were ordinary  receipts, not the "warehouse  receipts" defined by  the Warehouse Receipts Act (Act No.  2137). <br><br>After the  burning of the warehouse, the depositors of palay, including plaintiff, filed their claims with the Bureau of. Commerce, and it would appear that with the proceeds of the insurance policy,  the Bureau of Commerce paid  off some of  the claims.  Plaintiff's  counsel later withdrew his claim with the Bureau of Commerce, according to Go Tiong, because  his claim  was denied by the Bureau, but according to the decision of the trial court, because nothing came from plaintiff's efforts to have his claim paid.  Thereafter, Gonzales  filed the present action  against Go  Tiong and the Luzon Surety fdr the sum of P8,600, the value of his palay, with legal interest, damages in the sum of P5,000 and P1,500 as attorney's fees.  Gonzales later renewed his claim with  the  Bureau of Commerce (Exhibit  S). <br><br>While  the case was pending in court,  Gonzales and Go Tiong  entered into a contract of  amicable settlement to the effect that upon the settlement of all accounts due to him  by Go  Hong, he, Gonzales,  would  have  all actions pending  against  Go  Tiong  dismissed.  Inasmuch  as Go Tiong failed to  settle the accounts,  Gonzales  prosecuted his court action. <br><br>For purposes  of reference, we reproduce the assignment of errors of Go  Tiong, as well as the  assignment of errors of the  Luzon Surety, all reading thus:<br><blockquote>"I. The trial court erred in  finding that  plaintiff-appellee's claim is covered by the  Bonded Warehouse Law,  Act 3893,  as amended, and not by  the Civil Code. <br><br>"II. The trial court erred in not exempting  defendant-appellant Go Tiong  for the  loss of the palay deposited,  pursuant  to the provisions  of  the New Civil Code."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *  *  *  *  * <br></div><br>"I. The trial court erred in not declaring that the amicable settlement by and between plaintiff-appellee  and defendant Go  Tiong constituted a  material alteration of the surety bond of appellant Luzon Surety which extinguished and discharged its liability. <br><br>"II. The trial court erred in holding  that the receipts for the palay received by Go Tiong, though not  in the  form of "quedans" or warehouse  receipts are chargeable  against the surety bond filed under the  provisions of the  General Bonded Warehouse Act (Act No. 3893 as  amended by Republic Act No. 247) as a result of  a loss. <br><br>"III. The trial court erred in not holding that the plaintiff had renounced and abandoned his rights under  the  Bonded  Warehouse Act by the withdrawal of his claim from the Bureau of Commerce and the execution of the 'amicable settlement'.      <br><br>"IV. The trial court erred in not holding that the palay delivered to Go Tiong  constitutes gratuitous deposit which was extinguished upon the loss and destruction  of  the  subject-matter. <br><br>"V. The trial  court erred in not declaring that the transaction between defendant Go Tiong and plaintiff was more of a sale rather titan a  deposit. <br><br>"VI. The trial court erred in declaring that the  Luzon Surety Co.,  Inc.,  had  not  complied  with its undertaking despite  the liquidation of all the claims by the Bureau of Commerce. <br><br>"VII.  The lower court erred  in adjudging the herein surety liable under the terms of the  Bond." </blockquote> We  shall discuss the  assigned errors at the same time, considering the close  relation between them,  although we do not  propose to discuss and  rule upon all of  them.  Both appellants urge that  plaintiff's claim  is governed by the Civil Code  and not by  the Bonded Warehouse Act  (Act No.  3893, as amended by Republic Act No. 247),  for the reason that, as already stated, what Go Tiong issued  to plaintiff were ordinary receipts, not the warehouse receipts contemplated by the Warehouse Receipts  Law, and because the deposits of palay  of plaintiff  were  gratuitous. <br><br>Act  No.  3893 as amended is  a special  law regulating the  business of  receiving  commodities  for  storage  and denning the rights and obligations  of a bonded warehouse- man  and  those  transacting  business  with   him.  Consequently, any deposit made with him as a bonded warehouseman must necessarily be governed  by the provisions of Act No. 3893.  The kind or nature of the receipts issued by him for the deposits is not very  material, much  less decisive.  Though it is  desirable that receipts issued by a bonded warehouseman should conform  to the provisions of the  Warehouse Receipts Law,  said provisions  in  our opinion are not mandatory and indispensable  in the sense that if they fell short  of the requirements of the Warehouse  Receipts Act,  then  the commodities delivered for storage become ordinary deposits and will not  be governed by the  provisions of the Bonded Warehouse Act.  Under Section 1 of the Warehouse Receipts Act, one would gather the impression  that the  issuance of a warehouse receipt in the form  provided  by  it  is  merely  permissive and directory and not obligatory: <br><blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Persons who may issue receipts.</span>â€”Warehouse receipts may  be issued by any warehouseman.", and  the Bonded Warehouse Act as amended permits the warehouseman  to issue any receipt, thus:<br><br>"* * *. 'receipt' as any receipt issued by a  warehouseman for commodity delivered to him." </blockquote>As the trial court well observed,  as far as Go Tiong was concerned, the fact that the receipts issued by him were not "quedans" is no valid ground for  defense  because he was  the principal obligor.   Furthermore, as found by the trial  court, Go  Tiong had  repeatedly promised plaintiff to issue to him "quedans"  and had assured him that he should not worry; and that Go Tiong was in the habit  of issuing ordinary receipts (not "quedans") to his depositors. <br><br>As  to  the  contention that  the deposits  made by the plaintiff were  free  because he paid no fees  therefor,  it would appear  that  Go Tiong induced  plaintiff to deposit his palay in  the warehouse  free of charge in  order  to promote his business and to attract other depositors,  it being understood  that because  of  this  accommodation, plaintiff  would  convince  other palay  owners  to deposit with Go Tiong. <br><br>Appellants contend that the burning of the warehouse was  a fortuitous event and not  due to  any fault of Go Tiong and that consequently,  he should not be  held liable, appellants supporting  the contention with  the ruling  in the case of La Sociedad Dalisay vs. De los Reyes, 55 Phil. 452,  reading as follows: <br><blockquote>"Inasmuch as the fire,  according to the judgment appealed from, was neither intentional nor due to the negligence of the appellant company or its officials;  and  it appearing from the  evidence that the then manager attempted to  save the palay, the appellant company should not be held responsible for  damages  resulting  from said fire. ***."<br></blockquote>The trial court correctly disposed of  this same contention, thus:<br><blockquote>"The defense that the palay was  destroyed by fire .neither does. the  Court consider to be good for while the contract was in the nature  of a deposit and the loss of the thing would exempt the obligor in a contract of deposit to return the goods, this exemption from the responsibility for the damages must be conditioned in his proof that the loss was by  force majeure, and without his  fault. The Court does not see from the evidence that the proof is clear on the legal exemption.   On the contrary, the fact that he exceeded the  limit  of the  authorized  deposit  must  have  increased the risk and  would militate against  his defense of nonliability.  For this reason, the Court does not follow La Sociedad vs.  De Los Santos, 55 Phil. 42 quoted  by Go Tiong."   (p. 3,  Decision)<br></blockquote>Considering the  fact,  as  already  stated, that prior to the  burning of the warehouse, plaintiff demanded the payment  of the value  of his palay  from Go Tiong  on  two occasions but was put off without any valid reason, under the  circumstances,  the better rule which  we  accept is the following: <br><blockquote>"* * * This rule proceeds upon the  theory that the facts surrounding the care of the property by a bailee are peculiarly within his knowledge and power to prove, and that the enforcement of any other rule would impose great difficulties upon the bailors. * * * It is illogical and unreasonable  to hold that the presumption of  negligence  in case of this kind is rebutted by the bailee by simply proving that the property bailed was destroyed by an ordinary fire which broke out  on  the bailee's own premises, without regard to the care exercised by the latter to prevent  the fire, or to  save the property after the commencement of the fire.  All  the  authorities seem to  agree that  the rule  that there shall be a  presumption of negligence in bailment cases  like the present one,  where  there is default in delivery or accounting,  for the goods  is just a necessary one.  * * * " (9  A.L.R. 566; see also Hanes vs. Shapiro, 84  S.E. 33; J. Russel Mfg. Co. va. New Haven, S.B. Co., 50  N.Y. 211; Beck vs. Wilkins-Ricks Co.,102 S.E. 313; Fleishman vs. Southern R. Co., 56 S.E.  974).</blockquote>    Besides, as  observed by  the trial court,  the  defendant violated  the  terms of his license by accepting for  deposit palay in excess of the limit authorized by his license, which fact must have increased the risk. <br><br>The Luzon  Surety claims that the amicable settlement by and  between  Gonzales  and Go Tiong  constituted  a material, alteration of its bond, thereby extinguishing and discharging its liability.   It is evident, however, that while there was an attempt to settle the case amicably, the settlement was  never consummated because Go Tiong  failed to settle the accounts of Gonzales to the Tatter's satisfaction. Consequently, said nonconsummated compromise settlement does not discharge the surety: <br><blockquote>"A compromise or  settlement between the creditor or obligee and the principal,  by which the  latter is discharged from liability, discharges the, sorely, * * *.  But an unconsummated * * *  agreement to compromise, falling short of an effective settlement,  will not discharge  the surety."  (50  C. J. 185) </blockquote>In relation to the failure of Go Tiong to issue the  warehouse  receipts contemplated by the Warehouse  Receipts Act,  which   failure,  according  to  appellants, precluded plaintiff from suing on the  bond, reference may  be made to Section 2  of Act No. 3893, defining receipt as any receijjt issued by a warehouseman  for commodity delivered  to him, showing that the law does not require as indispensable that a warehouse receipt be  issued.  Furthermore, Section 7  of said  law provides  that as long as the depositor is injured by a breach of any obligation of the warehouseman, which obligation is secured by a bond, said depositor may sue on said bond.  In other words, the surety cannot avoid liability  from the mere  failure of the warehouseman  to issue the prescribed receipt.  In the case of Andreson vs. Krueger, 212  N.W. 198,  199, it was held: <br><blockquote>"The surety company  concedes that the bond which  it  gave contains the  statutory conditions.  The statute * * * requires that the bondâ€”'shall be conditioned  upon the faithful  performance  of the public local  grain warehouseman of all the provisions of  law relating to the storage of grain by  such warehouseman.'<br><br>"The surety company thereby made itself responsible for the performance  by the warehouseman  of all the  duties and obligations imposed  upon him by the statute; and, if he failed  to  perform any such duty to the loss or detriment of those who delivered grain for  storage,  the surety  company  became  liable  therefor.  Where the warehouseman receives grain for storage and  refuses to return or  pay it,  the  fact that he failed to issue the receipt, when the statute required him  to issue on receiving it, is  not available to the surety as a defense against an action on the bond.   The obligation of the  surety covers the duty  of the  warehouseman  to issue the prescribed receipt, as well as  the other  duties imposed upon him by the  statute."</blockquote>We deem  it unnecessary to discuss and  rule upon  the other questions  raised in  the  appeal. In view of the foregoing, the appealed decision is hereby affirmed,  with costs.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
