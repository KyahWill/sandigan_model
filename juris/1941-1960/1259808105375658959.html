				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 6, 1952, Dee&nbsp; Sam alias Samuel Dee, a Chinese subject,&nbsp;&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; application&nbsp; for naturalization&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the usual proceedings,&nbsp; the application was granted on January&nbsp; 27, 1953 and&nbsp; it was ordered that in due course and upon compliance with the&nbsp; requisites prescribed by law a&nbsp; naturalization certificate&nbsp; issue to the&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; On February 16,&nbsp; 1955, more than two years&nbsp; from the granting of the application for&nbsp; naturalization, the applicant&nbsp; petitioned the court to allow him&nbsp; to&nbsp; take his&nbsp; oath of&nbsp; allegiance&nbsp; as a&nbsp; Filipino citizen.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; his petition, he alleged, among other things, that he had "continuously resided in the Philippines since the promulgation of the decision".&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; he admitted that in 1953&nbsp; he made a trip to Saigon where he remained for&nbsp; two weeks to settle, according to him, the estate of&nbsp; his&nbsp; father&nbsp; who had died in&nbsp; Paris. In view&nbsp; of this admission, the&nbsp; Solicitor General&nbsp; opposed the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the court, after hearing, granted it just the same, holding that petitioner's short absence from the Philippines in 1953 was not violative of Republic Act No. 530.&nbsp;&nbsp; From that resolution the&nbsp; Republic of&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; has&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to this Court.<br><br>Sections 1 and 2 of said Republic Act No. 530 provides:<br><blockquote>"Section&nbsp; 1. The&nbsp; provisions of existing laws&nbsp; notwithstanding, no petition for&nbsp; Philippine citizenship shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; heard by&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts until after six months fronl the publication of the application required by law, nor&nbsp; shall&nbsp; any decision granting the&nbsp; application become executory until&nbsp; after two years from its promulgation&nbsp; and&nbsp; after the court, on&nbsp; proper hearing, with the attendance of the Solicitor General or his representative, is&nbsp; satisfied, and so finds, that during the intervening time the applicant has (1) not&nbsp; left the Philippines, (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; had dedicated himself continuously to&nbsp; a lawful&nbsp; calling&nbsp; or profession, (3) has not boon&nbsp; convicted of any&nbsp; offense or violation of Government promulgated rules, (4)&nbsp; or committed any act prejudicial to the interest of the nation or&nbsp; contrary to&nbsp; any Government announced policies. <br><br>"Sec. 2. After the&nbsp; finding&nbsp; mentioned in section one,&nbsp; the order of the&nbsp; court granting&nbsp; citizenship shall be registered and the oath provided by existing laws shall be taken by any applicant', whereupon, and not before, he will be entitled to all the privileges&nbsp; of Filipino citizen."<br></blockquote>The above provisions postpone&nbsp; for two&nbsp; years the execution&nbsp; of the decision granting an application&nbsp; for.Philippine citizenship.&nbsp; The purpose obviously is to&nbsp; put the applicant on probation for the length of time, and thereafter he is to be&nbsp; invested with the,privilege&nbsp; of Philippine citizenship only if he proves to the satisfaction of the court that since the granting of his application for naturalization he (1) has&nbsp; not left the Philippines,&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; had dedicated himself continuously to a lawful calling or profession, (3) has not been convicted of any offense or&nbsp; violation of Government promulgated rules,&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; or committed any act prejudicial to the interest&nbsp; of the nation or contrary to&nbsp; any Government announced policies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Strict compliance&nbsp; with these&nbsp; conditions is essential if the purpose of&nbsp; the law&nbsp; is to be achieved, so that a violation of any of them ,bars applicant's admission&nbsp; to Philippine citizenship.<br><br>Counsel for applicant,&nbsp; however, calls&nbsp; attention to&nbsp; the case of Luis Uy <span style="font-style: italic;">vs. </span>Republic of the Philippines <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span>&nbsp; G. R. No. L-7054,&nbsp; promulgated April 29,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; where this&nbsp; Court said—albeit by way of dictum—that the requirement as to non-absence might possibly admit of some exceptions,&nbsp; as where the applicant is sent abroad on a Government mission, or kidnapped or forcibly removed from the Philippines or obliged to £0 and stay abroad to undergo&nbsp; an&nbsp; operation to save his life.&nbsp; But it is obvious that&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case does not come under any, of those exceptions, and further relaxation of the aforesaid requirement in&nbsp; deference&nbsp; to private need or convenience should be avoided as not to open the door to evasions and render the law ineffective. In&nbsp; view of the foregoing, the order appealed from is revoked and set aside and applicant's petition for the taking of oath denied, with costs. against the&nbsp; appellant.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
