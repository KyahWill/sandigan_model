				<H3>M. M. DE LOS REYES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. CORONET, INC., DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The plaintiff and&nbsp; appellant filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila a complaint&nbsp; against the defendant and appellee&nbsp;&nbsp; for breach of&nbsp; contract&nbsp; and/or for damages. Alleging&nbsp; that this complaint is a mere reproduction&nbsp; of appellant's counterclaim in Civil Case No.&nbsp; 40884, Coronet, Inc. vs.&nbsp; M. M. de&nbsp; los Reyes, which had already been dismissed by&nbsp; the Municipal Court of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; the appellee filed a motion to dismiss&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">res juridicata</span>. As the Court of First Instance of Manila sustained this ground of dismissal, the present appeal was taken&nbsp; by the plaintiff. <br><br>The records show that&nbsp; the Municipal Court of Manila dismissed appellant's counterclaim&nbsp; because the same was already the&nbsp; subject matter of&nbsp; a separate (the present) complaint between the same parties in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila, without trial on&nbsp; the merits.&nbsp; In fact there could not have been a trial on the merits, inasmuch as said counterclaim&nbsp; (for actual damages&nbsp; of P20,000 and moral damages of&nbsp; P5,000) was beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court.&nbsp; The Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila therefore erred in sustaining&nbsp; the plea&nbsp; of res&nbsp; juridicata (L-9640, Manlapaz&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Pagdanganan, November 26, 1957.) <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the order&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; reversed and the case remanded to the Court of First Instance of Manila for further proceedings.&nbsp; So ordered&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the appellee. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L., Endencia,</span> and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Felix, JJ., </span>concur. <br></div>
