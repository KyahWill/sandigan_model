				<H3>RAMCAR, INC., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. CHINA BANKING CORPORATION, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 12,&nbsp; 1950 the Manila court of first instance rendered judgment requiring the China Banking Corporation, defendant, to pay plaintiff Ramcar&nbsp; Inc. the sum of P16,271.72 with interest, plus&nbsp; damages&nbsp; of P5,000&nbsp; etc. The defendant appealed to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; Nevertheless plaintiff asked for, and obtained, execution pending appeal;&nbsp; and pursuant&nbsp; thereto,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; turned over to the former the total&nbsp; sum of P21.089.39&nbsp; on January&nbsp; 11,. 1951.<br><br>In due course the matter&nbsp; was decided by the Court of Appeals&nbsp; whose judgment on February 28, 1953 as amended, contained this dispositive part:<br><blockquote>"Wherefore, the Court renders judgment in favor of the Plaintiff-Appellee and against&nbsp; tile&nbsp; Defendant-Appellant, ordering the&nbsp; latter to pay the&nbsp; former the sum of P16,168.88, with interest at&nbsp; the rate of 6 per cent from the&nbsp; date of the filing of the complaint, until the&nbsp; said sum shall have been fully paid, with costs against the said&nbsp; Defendant-Appellant."<br></blockquote>Upon&nbsp; return of&nbsp; the expediente,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant pointed to its overpayment and asked that plaintiff refund&nbsp; to it "whatever amount&nbsp; is due the latter after deducting the interest&nbsp; and cost from the filing of the case&nbsp; until January 10, 1951 inclusive."&nbsp; The Manila court&nbsp; so ordered.<br><br>The plaintiff appealed such&nbsp; order reiterating&nbsp; its contention that, it may deduct interest <i>not only up to January 10, 1951 but up to&nbsp; the decision of the Court of Appeals, February 28, 1953.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiie defendant argued, and the Manila court held,&nbsp; that interest was not 'due after January&nbsp; 10, 1951 inasmuch as defendant had delivered&nbsp; P21,088.39, to plaintiff on January 11, 1951.<br><br>This&nbsp; appeal has no&nbsp; merit.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals in February 1953 modified the order of the Manila court of first instance&nbsp; by&nbsp; requiring&nbsp; the&nbsp; China, Bank to&nbsp; pay Ramcar Inc. P16,168.88 (instead of&nbsp; P21,088.S9) with&nbsp; interest * * *&nbsp; until the said sum shall have been <i>fully paid.</i> Inasmuch as the said sum had been fully paid January&nbsp; 11, 1951' (upon execution pending appeal), it logically follows that plaintiff is entitled to interest only up to January 10, 1951.&nbsp; The&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; had full&nbsp; use of the money on January 11, 1951; wherefore in law and equity it may not demand interest thereon for the days thereafter.<br><br>The&nbsp; order is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.&nbsp; L. </i>and <i>Endentia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
