				<H3>FEDERAL FILMS, INC., PETITIONER, VS. JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, BRANCH IX, JOSE GUTIERREZ DAVID AND PABLO ROMAN, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an original proceeding for certiorari instituted by the petitioner, 
Federal Films, Inc., for the purpose of annulling the order of the respondent 
Judge, Honorable Jose Gutierrez David, dated December 17, 1946, dismissing 
petitioner's appeal in civil case No. 73256, Pablo Roman, plaintiff, <i>vs</i>. 
Federal Films, Inc., defendant.
<p>On September 27, 1946, the petitioner received notice of the judgment 
rendered by the respondent Judge in civil case No. 73256. The next day, 
September 28, the petitioner filed a petition to set aside the judgment. On 
October 8, 1946, the petitioner was notified of the order denying its petition. 
On October 17, 1946, the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration based on 
the same grounds alleged in its petition to set aside, the order denying said 
motion having been served on the petitioner on October 31, 1946. On November 7, 
1946, the petitioner filed its notice of appeal, record on appeal, and appeal 
bond. The question that arises—which was resolved by the respondent Judge 
adversely to the petitioner—is whether petitioner's appeal was perfected within 
the reglementary period of thirty days, counted from the date the petitioner was 
notified of the judgment and after deducting the time during which the petition 
to set aside was pending (Rule of Court No. 41, section 3).</p>
<p>At the outset, it must be ruled that the 30-day period was not interrupted by 
the filing on October 17, 1946, of petitioner's motion for reconsideration 
(which was a mere reiteration of its petition to set aside), in view of Rule of 
Court No. 37, section 4 (<i>see</i> Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 
I, p. 345). Hence our task is merely to determine the period transpiring between 
September 27 and November 7, 1946, and the period transpiring between September 
28 and October 8, 1946, and thereafter to deduct the second from the first, the 
result showing the number of days used up by the petitioner for the perfection 
of its appeal.</p>
<p>Rule of Court No. 28 defines the manner of computing any period of time 
prescribed or allowed by the rules, oy order of court, or by any applicable 
statute, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>How to compute time</i>.—In computing any period of time prescribed or 
allowed by these rules, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the day 
of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins 
to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be 
included, unless it is a Sunday or a legal holiday, in which event the time 
shall run until the end of the next day which is neither a Sunday nor a 
holiday."</p></blockquote>
<p>Vulgarly stated, this rule adopts the exclude-the-first and include-the-last 
day method for computing any period of time. By simple mathematical operation, 
we therefore find that from September 27 (the date petitioner received notice of 
the judgment) to November 7, 1946, when the appeal was perfected, there are 
actually 41 days, September 27 being excluded and November 7 included in the 
counting. We find also that from September 28 to October 8, 1946, the period 
during which the petition to set aside was pending, there are actually 10 days, 
September 28 being excluded and October 8 included in the counting. Deducting 10 
from 41, the result is 31. Which means that petitioner's appeal was filed one 
day late.</p>
<p>Petitioner's appeal may be considered as having been filed within 30 days 
only if the decision in the case of Taroma <i>vs</i>. Cruz and Galinato (68 
Phil., 281), were still to be followed. After re-examining said decision, 
however, we are constrained, to overrule so much thereof as included the date of 
the filing of the motion for new trial and the date the movant was notified of 
the order of denial in the time consumed by the court in considering said motion 
for new trial and deducted from the 30-day period for perfecting the appeal. 
Indeed, we have recently refused to follow the Taroma decision, when invoked, in 
G. R. Nos. L-381 to L-384, Vda. de Celis <i>vs</i>. Palileo.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>The petitioner complains about the motion which gave rise to the order sought 
to be annulled, because it was filed in the Court of First Instance on December 
13, 1946, and set for hearing on the following day. Of course, section 4 of Rule 
of Court No. 26 requires that "notice of a motion shall be served by the 
applicant to all parties concerned, at least three days before the hearing 
thereof," but in the same breath the rule states that "the court, however, for 
good cause may hear a motion on shorter notice, specially on matters which the 
court may dispose of on its own motion." Even without holding that the 
respondent Judge could dismiss on his own initiative petitioner's appeal under 
section 13 of Rule of Court No. 41, we cannot say that the motion in question 
was heard on shorter notice without good cause, it appearing that the respondent 
Judge was appointed Justice of the Court of Appeals and was supposed to hold his 
last session in the Court of First Instance on December 14, 1946. Moreover, it 
is noteworthy that the petitioner, through counsel, received notice of the 
motion, filed a written opposition thereto on the merits, and appeared and 
argued at the hearing, with the consequence that no substantial right of the 
petitioner can be alleged to have been prejudiced.</p>
<p>The petition will therefore be, as the same is hereby, dismissed with costs 
against the petitioner. So ordered.</p><i>Pablo, Bengzon, Hontiveros,</i> and 
<i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Notice of judgment of the lower court was received by petitioner on September 
27, 1946. Petitioner filed a petition to set aside the judgment on September 28. 
He was notified of the denial of said petition on October 8. Notice of appeal, 
record on appeal and the appeal bond were filed on November 7. The lower court 
dismissed the appeal on the ground of its alleged lateness. The question is 
whether the appeal was filed within the thirty days provided in Section 3 of 
Rule 41 which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>How appeal is taken</i>.—Appeal may be taken by serving upon the adverse 
party and filing with the trial court within thirty days from notice of order or 
judgment, a notice of appeal, an appeal bond, and a record on appeal. The time 
during which a motion to set aside has been pending shall be 
deducted."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no quarrel between the majority and us on the fact that from 
September 27, the date of notice of the judgment, to November 7, date of the 
appeal, forty-one days had elapsed. But, under the above-quoted provision, "the 
time during which a motion to set aside has been pending shall be deducted" in 
reckoning the thirty-day period within which appeal may be taken.</p>
<p>The motion to set aside the judgment has been pending <i>since September 
28</i>, date of its filing, to <i>October 8</i>, when petitioner was notified of 
the denial of the petition. Therefore, the motion to set aside has been pending 
for <i>eleven days</i>, that is: September 28, 29, and 30 and October 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Three days of September and eight days of October all in all 
make, in classical mathematics, eleven days. There should not be any question 
that the motion begun to be pending since September 28, the date of its filing, 
and remained so until October 8, when petitioner was notified of the order 
denying it.</p>
<p>But in counting the days during which the motion to set aside the judgment 
has been pending the majority arbitrarily <i>exclude September 28</i>. They 
invoke in support of their stand the provisions of Rule 28. The application of 
the rule is flagrantly wrong. Rule 28 applies only to periods of time 
"prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of court, or by any applicable 
statute." Can the majority point out any part of the rules, or any order of 
court, or any statute prescribing or allowing any period of time within which 
<i>a motion to set aside judgment should remain pending</i>? There is none that 
can be pointed out.</p>
<p>The time of pendency of the motion cannot be fixed or determined, because it 
depends on many unpredictable circumstances, such as the time it will take 
either party to argue or file their memoranda, the time it will take the court 
to study the question or questions raised, the time it will take the clerk of 
court and other employees to deliver the corresponding order to the parties.</p>
<p>The majority <i>expressly exclude September 28</i>, the date when the motion 
to set aside was filed. The exclusion is an open violation of the provision of 
Section 3 of Rule 41 which says that "the time during which a motion to set 
aside has been pending shall be deducted" and, as a matter of fact, there should 
not be any dispute, unless truth is to be twisted, that <i>the motion begun to 
be pending since September 28</i>.</p>
<p>We feel that all discussion of the decisions in the Taroma and Celis cases 
cannot conceal the conclusive fact that the motion to set aside here in question 
has been filed on September 28, and since then it begun to be pending. Besides, 
in the Celis case mentioned by the majority there cannot be found any 
pronouncement of any doctrine, unless we can avail ourselves of the divination 
help of the Delphian oracle, or a spiritualistic medium, or a simple 
crystal-gazer. The absurdity of the majority's position can be conclusively 
shown if we take the hypothesis that the lower court had denied the motion to 
set aside in the afternoon of the same September 28. As, according to the 
majority, the motion should have begun to be pending only from <i>September 
29</i>, the second day following the day of its filing, then the majority will 
have to declare as an absolute truth that the motion had not been pending at any 
time, although it took the court several hours before disposing of it. And 
anyone who should aver that it has been pending from 9 a. m., supposing that it 
was filed on that hour, until 4 p. m., when it was denied and the denial was 
notified to the parties, will commit a falsehood. We cannot agree with a 
proposition which leads to such a preposterous conclusion.</p>
<p>Whether the motion to set aside the judgment was or was not pending on 
September 27 seems to be a very simple question and easy to answer. Pending 
means "not yet decided; in continuance; in suspense." It means also "hanging; 
overhanging; imminent or impending." The word came from the Latin 
<i>pendens</i>, <i>pendentis</i>, from the verb <i>pendere</i>, which means to 
hang, to be suspended. Applied to a judicial process, it means "remaining 
undetermined; waiting decision." So it is self-evident that the motion begun to 
be pending <i>since September 28</i>, the very day of its filing.</p>
<p>But the majority declared that it begun to be pending <i>only since September 
29</i>. What then was the condition of the motion on September 28? If it was not 
pending, was it decided, determined, or in any way acted upon? No. If it begun 
to be pending only on September 29, how could it have been decided on September 
28, <i>one day before</i>?</p>
<p>Decision can only be rendered on something waiting to be decided. It is an 
action upon a pre-existent condition of things. It is the disposition of a 
pre-existent controversy. It is the selection of two or more alternative 
solutions to a juridical or moral problem. So, if the motion was neither pending 
nor decided on <i>September 28</i>, what was its condition then? To properly 
answer this question there is an imminent peril of going to the extent of 
declaring that <i>on September 28 it was not existing at all</i>. That seems to 
be the only alternative not to incur in the falsehood of declaring that <i>it 
was not pending on September 28</i>. But the alternative drags us to fall in an 
evident untruth.</p>
<p>Such is the irony in man that, while there are no bounds to limit his 
ambition in unravelling the most recondite riddles of the universe and trying to 
answer the most esoteric and abstruse questions of metaphysics, it fails to see 
what is simple and obvious. There are many people who continue to identify the 
absolute certainty of number thirteen with aleatory bad luck. They never 
hesitate to undertake the adventure of exploring the farthest horizons of the 
unknown, but have no eyes to see the bridge of their nose. Perhaps that is the 
way the Einstenian principle of relativity works in human beings. What produces 
dejection is that the paradox in this case results in an unjust deprivation of 
petitioner's legal right to appeal against the lower court's decision.</p>
<p>Our opinion is that petitioner's appeal has been filed and perfected with the 
thirty-day period allowed by the rules, after deducting the eleven days within 
which the motion to set aside the judgment has been pending, as expressly 
provided by Section 3 of Rule 41. The reduction of said eleven-day period to 
only ten days, as made by the majority, is wholly groundless and arbitrary and, 
besides, contravenes a specific provision of Section 3 of Rule 41.</p>We vote to 
grant the petition and that a mandate be issued ordering the respondent lower 
court to give due course to the appeal of petitioner.</div>
