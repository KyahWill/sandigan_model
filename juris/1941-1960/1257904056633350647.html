				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of Industrial Relations, an unfair labor practice case was 
instituted by CIR Acting Prosecutor Julio R. Logarta in behalf of petitioners 
Concha Sibal, Olimpia Arcilla, Maria Bulatre, Magdalena Sigua, Alfonso Lopez, 
Marieta Cabangal, Remedios Lumabas, and Estela Dublada, members of the Local 7, 
Press and Printing Free Workers (FFW), alleging that petitioners were dismissed 
by their employer respondent United Cardboard Box Factory upon request of the 
latter's co-respondent, Democratic Labor Union, with which respondent Company 
has a collective bargaining agreement with a close shop clause; that 
petitioners, upon hearing of the close shop agreement, applied for membership 
with the respondent Union but were not accepted, and instead, were dismissed by 
Tan Tiong So, manager of respondent Company; and that said acts of respondents 
Union and Company are in violation of Section 4 (a) (4) and 4(b) (2)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of Republic Act No. 875. It is prayed, 
among others, that respondents Union and Company be declared guilty of unfair 
labor practice as charged; that respondent Union be directed to accept said 
petitioners as its members; and (3) that respondent Company be ordered to 
reinstate petitioners to their former positions with back wages from the time of 
their dismissal to the date of their actual reinstatement.
<p>Although both respondents filed their respective answers, neither appeared at 
the hearing at which petitioners were allowed to present their evidence. The 
court, on January 29,1959, rendered, judgment, the pertinent portion of which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Issues having been joined, this case was heard on August 15, 1958 with 
complainants presenting as their first witness Benjamin Umali who testified that 
complainant union is duly registered and that individual complainants are its 
members who were formerly employed in respondent company; that individual 
complainants were dismissed on or about May 27, 1957, because they were 
discriminated against in regard to their union membership; that despite repeated 
requests, both respondents refused to furnish complainant union copy of the 
collective bargaining agreement embodying the closed-shop provision; that 
individual complainants wanted to see the closed-shop agreement to verify its 
existence before joining the respondent union, and that he (Umali) was able to 
see the same in the Department of Labor only on May 29, 1957; that upon 
verification, he (Umali) immediately told complainant union members to join 
respondent union pursuant to said closed-shop provision, that is, as a condition 
of their continued employment; that on May 30, 1957, complainant union members 
applied for membership in respondent union which refused them, and that for this 
sole reason, respondent company likewise did not accept them for work.</p>
<p>"On cross-examination, Umali declared that he was informed of the existence 
of the closed-shop agreement when he received &amp; letter from one Alegria B. 
Jose, but he was not shown copy of the collective bargaining contract containing 
the closed-shop in question; that individual complainants, although informed of 
the closed-shop agreement, have never seen copy of the same which they have been 
requesting from respondents; and that they (individual complainants) saw the 
agreement in question only on May 29, 1957 when he (Umali) went to the Labor 
Department to copy the same upon Suggestion of respondent company manager. "When 
asked by the Hearing Examiner, Umali stated that he had been dismissed at the 
time he saw the collective bargaining contract.</p>
<p>"Another witness for complainants, Mrs. Concha Sibal, was presented, 
testifying that she has been employed in respondent company since 1946 and that 
her co-complainants have likewise been working there for a long time; that 
complainant union was organized in November, 1953, much ahead of respondent 
union; that individual complainants were refused membership in respondent union 
and were not allowed to work anymore in respondent company. And in all other 
respects, Mrs. Sibal practically and substantially corroborated the testimony of 
witness Umali. She was not cross-examined,</p>
<p>"With the testimony "of the above Witnesses, the complainants rested their 
case. After several "notices of hearing duly sent to and received by the 
parties, respondents failed to appear and adduce their evidence. For this 
reason, this Court, in a hearing conducted on January 21, 1059, considered this 
case submitted for decision.</p>
<p>"From the evidence on record, it can be readily seen that complainant union 
members, have expressed their willingness to join respondent union upon 
verifying the existence of the collective bargaining: agreement embodying the 
closed-shop provision when they proceeded to the Department of Labor on May 29, 
1957, to copy said agreement. In fact, the following day, May 30, 1957, said 
complainants applied for membership in respondent union, but the latter refused 
them, for which reason, respondent company justified its stand for not accepting 
them for re-employment. It is therefore evident that individual complainants 
have shown their sincere desire to abide by the closed-shop contract entered 
into by respondent company and respondent union. The fact that they were not 
able to join respondent union within the period prescribed in the agreement, 
assuming there is such time limit, should not militate ggainst them for they 
were not furnished copy of the contract, notwithstanding their persistent 
requests from botfe respondents. Vigilant and zealous perhaps as they were, the 
individual complainants merely exercised the necessary diligen&amp;e and 
prudence as- union members before entering into the folds of another labor 
organization by requiring the respondents to prove the existence of the 
closed-shop provision in question. This, the respondents could have easily done 
by the simple expediency of showing to the complainants a copy of the collective 
bargaining contract which the former are supposed to possess.</p>
<p>"Closed-shop contract is the most prized achievement of unionism, as it adds 
membership and' compulsory dues. By holding out to loyal members a promise of 
employment in the closed-shop, it wields group solidarity. la keeping with this 
doctrine and with the protection to labor policy envisioned in our Constitution, 
this Court will liberally construe the closed-shop provision in question in 
favor of the increased membership, of the certified union and of the security' 
of tenure of the workers concerned. Respondent company even admitted in its 
answer that in spite of the length of period of absence of complainants, it will 
not refuse complainants' employment anytime, if the Court believes it will not 
violate closed-shop agreement. This Court holds there is no such intended 
violation.</p>
<p>"Wherefore, in view of the foregoing considerations, this Court hereby orders 
the respondent union to accept as additional members all the above-named 
individual complainants; namely,. Concha Sibal, Dolores Sison, Olimpia Arcilla, 
Maria Dulatre, Magdalena Sigua, Alfonso Lopez, Marieta Cabangal, Remedios 
Lumabas and Estela Dublada, directs the respondent Company to reinstate the said 
individual .complainants with full back wages from the time of their respective 
dismissals to their actual reinstatement; and requires the Court Examiner to 
examine the books and records of accounts and services at respondent company in 
order to compute the back wages of the individual complainants.</p>
<p>"So ORDERED.</p>
<p>"Manila, Philippines, January 29, 1959.</p>
<p align="right">"(Sgd.) Jose S. Bautista <br><em>Presiding 
Judge</em>."</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem that respondents Company and Union filed their respective 
motions for reconsideration of said decision, although these pleadings do not 
appear in the record. On February 26, 1959, the court <em>en banc</em> issued a 
resolution denying respondent Company's motion for reconsideration (nothing was 
said about the Union's motion) for failure to file arguments in support of its 
motion within the 10-day reglementary period prescribed by the rules of the 
court. No appeal was taken from this order.</p>
<p>On August 5, 1959, petitioners filed a motion for execution of the judgment, 
which was granted by the court, in its order of September 24, 1959.</p>
<p>However, on September 26, 1959, the court <em>en banc</em>, in considering 
respondent Union's motion for reconsideration (of the order of January 29, 1959) 
re-opened the entire case in a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the dispositive part of which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wherefore, the motion for reconsideration is hereby granted; and this case 
is, therefore, remanded to the Trial Court to reopen this case, allow the 
respondents to crose-examine the witnesses already presented by. the 
petitioners, and permit them to submit their evidence in support of their 
respective defenses, "So Ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p>Against this resolution, petitioners have filed the present petition for 
certiorari.</p>
<p>The resolution in question can not be sustained, insofar as it directs the 
reopening of the case as to respondent Company. In the answer filed in behalf of 
the Company, it admitted that it dismissed the herein petitioners, but alleged 
that it did so upon demand of the respondent Union on the strength of the 
closed-shop clause of its collective bargaining agreement. The record shows that 
it did not appear in any of the dates on which,the case was set for trial. The 
records further show that the Company's motion for reconsideration of the order 
(dated January 29, 1959) of the lower court directing the Company to reinstate 
the petitioners to their positions with back wages, was denied by the lower 
court, in its resolution <em>en banc</em> of February 26, 1959. Respondent 
Company did not appeal from said order or resolution; and the same, having 
become <em>final and executory</em>, petitioners, on August 5, 1959, filed a 
motion for execution of said order (of January 29), which the lower court 
granted, in its order of September 24, 1959. In the circumstances, the. lower 
court committed a grave error in reopening the case as to respondent 
Company.</p>
<p>At this juncture, it may be stated that petitioners' dismissal by respondents 
Company is unjustified, considering that the closed-shop clause contained in the 
collective bargaining agreement it entered into with respondent Union is 
inapplicable to petitioners who were already in the Company's service at the 
time of its execution (I Francisco, Labor Laws [3rd Ed.] 374-375, citing 
Electric Vacuum Cleaner Co., NLRB No. 76 [1989], cited in II Teller Labor 
Disputes and Collective Bargaining, 867-868). </p>
<p>Respondent Company's claim that the order of January 29, 1959 is not a final 
order and, therefore, is unappealable is correct, only insofar as it directs the 
CIR Examiner to examine its (the Company's) books and records of accounts and 
services, in order to compute the back wages of petitioners, but not as the 
portion of said order directing petitioners' reinstatement with full back wages 
from the time of their respective dismissals to their1 actual reinstatement. To 
our mind; an order of reinstatement, unlike an award, becomes final, upon the 
expiration of the time of appeal, as-it finally disposes of the pending action 
(for reinstatement), so that nothing more can be done with it in the . trial 
court (Mejia <em>vs</em>. Alimurong, 4 PhiK, 572; Olsen &amp; Olsen Co. 
<em>vs</em>. Olsen, 48 Phil., 238; 1 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court 
[1952] Ed. 894-895).</p>
<p>The aforementioned resolution' should, however, be upheld, insofar as it 
orders the case reopened with respect to the respondent Union, and allows It to 
cross-examine petitioners' witnesses and submit evidence for its defense. 
Respondent Union's motion for reconsideration, it will be noted, was filed in 
due time, before the resolution became final. The records disclose Borne 
justification for' the Union's failure to appear at the hearing of the case oh 
January 21,1959, which would indicate that the lower court committed no grave 
abuse of discretion as to constitute a reversible error. It appears that the 
previous hearings of the case were had before the CIR Hearing Examiner. Prior to 
the last date of hearing on January 21, however, the case was, without due 
notice to respondent union, withdrawn from the Examiner and assigned to CIR 
judge Jose S. Bautista. it is claimed for the union that due to the absence of 
said notice of the transfer of the hearing to the trial judge, respondent union 
failed to appear before the latter on said date.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is reason to reopen the case as' to respondent Union, to 
afford'it the opportunity to present evidence for its refusal or failure to 
admit petitioners as members thereof, considering that, as a rule, no laborer or 
employee has an abstract or absolute right to union membership (I Francisco, 
<em>op. cit.</em>,68-69, citing 31 Am. Jur. 861; 4 Am. Jur. 462; 97 ALR 
594).</p>
<p>For all the foregoing, the resolution appealed from is reversed, insofar as 
it directs the .reopening of the case as to respondent Company, but affirmed, 
insofar as it orders its reopening with respect to respondent Union. As to the 
latter, we hereby order the case remanded to the court <em>a quo</em>, for 
further proceedings consistent herewith. Without costs. It is so ordered. </p>

J.B.L., Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
