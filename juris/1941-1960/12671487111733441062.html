				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF FELISA F. HARRIS, DECEASED.  ANNE  H. MOLL, ADMINISTRATRIX AND APPELLANT, <I>VS.</I> ROSE HARRIS  AND  WILLIAM HARRIS,  PETITIONERS  AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; an appeal&nbsp; taken from&nbsp; an order issued&nbsp; by the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal&nbsp; (in&nbsp; Special&nbsp; Proceeding No.&nbsp; 2144)&nbsp; on January 30, 1956, removing appellant Annie Harris Moll from her office&nbsp; as Administratrix of the Intestate Estate of her deceased&nbsp; mother, Felisa F. Harris; ordering her to reimburse to&nbsp; the funds of the estate within 30 days from notice of the order, the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P11,687.67; directing her to submit a statement of the&nbsp; value of the 55 common shares of the "La Fabrica de Cerveza&nbsp; de San Miguel" sold on March 19, 1955 and to deposit with the Clerk of Court the sum of P1,700 placed in her own account at the Commercial Bank &amp; Trust Co.<br><br>It appears that on September 15, 1955, the administratrix-appellant filed a&nbsp; verified <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> petition for authority to mortgage the house and lot Under her administration, situated in San Juan, Rizal, with an assessed&nbsp; value of P10,340.00, for the purpose of securing funds to be used in finishing the construction of the house erected on said lot,&nbsp; with the express conformity of&nbsp; petitioners-appellees William and Rose Harris, two of the five surviving children of the deceased.1&nbsp; On September 17, 1955, the court issued an&nbsp; order granting&nbsp; her the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; to&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; said house and lot, for a sum not to exceed P20,000.00&nbsp; "said amount to be utilized for the purpose stated in the petition, namely,&nbsp; in&nbsp; finishing the construction&nbsp; of said&nbsp; house and lot."<br><br>On September 22,1955, contrary to the authority granted her, the administratirx-appellant obtained from the Philippine&nbsp; National Bank an&nbsp; agricultural&nbsp; and&nbsp; or&nbsp; commercial loan for P19,000.00, and out of the proceeds thereof, she paid&nbsp; Caruso S. Moll, her husband, the sum of P6,000.00 in reimbursement, so she alleged, of his advances for the construction of the house of the deceased during her lifetime; P500.00 each to appellees Rose and William Harris; and the&nbsp; balance in the sum of P11,687.67 she invested&nbsp; in the Moll Enterprises allegedly "for the purpose of deriving profits with which to pay all the obligations of the intestacy."&nbsp; The mortgage constituted in favor&nbsp; of the Philippine National Bank to&nbsp; guarantee the loan has never been submitted to&nbsp; the&nbsp; court for approval.<br><br>Required&nbsp; to make an explanation of her actuation, the administratrix-appellant filed a written manifestation claiming that the dispositions of the proceeds of the mortgage were&nbsp; made&nbsp; with the verbal conformity&nbsp; of the petitioners-appellees.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the same manifestation, she prayed (1) that the order of the court dated December 10, 1955, requiring her to deposit the proceeds of the mortgage with a banking institution be&nbsp; reconsidered and set aside; and (2) that the order of the court dated&nbsp; September 17, 1955, be modified to the extent of authorizing the dispositions she had already made of the amount obtained from the Philippine National Bank, the same having been made in good faith and being beneficial to the intestate estate tinder administration.<br><br>On January 25, 1956, the petitioners-appellees filed an opposition to the aforesaid manifestation (explanation) of the&nbsp; administratrix-appellant, and the court finding the dispositions a grave violation of the authority granted, on January 30, 1956, issued an order in the tenor&nbsp; set&nbsp; forth at the beginning of this&nbsp; opinion.<br><br>On&nbsp; February 6,&nbsp; 1956, the administratrix-appellant appealed to the Court&nbsp; of Appeals, but&nbsp; said Court, in its resolution of April 28, 1958,&nbsp; certified the case to this Court stating:<br><br><blockquote>"The main&nbsp; questions&nbsp; poised&nbsp; in this&nbsp; appeal are:&nbsp; whether the authority to mortgage was validly granted; whether the mortgage contract executed in virtue thereof is valid and binding upon the estate; and whether the proceeds of the said mortgage are funds of the administration of the estate which must be&nbsp; accounted for by&nbsp; the&nbsp; administratrix-appellant.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; previous resolution&nbsp; of these&nbsp; questions depends the&nbsp; final&nbsp; judgment on whether&nbsp; the order appealed from&nbsp; should be affirmed or&nbsp; reversed.<br><br>"Considering that the foregoing questions, predicated on undisputed facts, are purely of&nbsp; law and come under&nbsp; the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, let this case&nbsp; be certified&nbsp; to the Supreme Court for&nbsp; final disposition, as prayed for&nbsp; by counsel for appellant."</blockquote><br>We agree with the Court&nbsp; of Appeals that the issues raised by appellant-administratrix in this appeal are as stated in the foregoing quotation. But in&nbsp; the view we take of the case as a whole, these questions&nbsp; need not be decided&nbsp; in this instance because appellant&nbsp; is&nbsp; in estoppel to&nbsp; invoke the invalidity of the authority granted her at her own behest as well as of the mortgage executed by her, specially in&nbsp; the absence of the mortgagee, the Philippine National Bank, as a party to these proceedings.&nbsp; She can not take advantage of her own irregular, if not illegal, acts and argue therefrom that she is not accountable&nbsp; to the intestate&nbsp; estate&nbsp; under her&nbsp; administration for the&nbsp; funds received by her because the authority with which she succeeded in obtaining them was invalid and that, therefore, the money did not belong to the estate. The&nbsp; fact is that the money&nbsp; was delivered to, and&nbsp; receipted for by her as administratrix&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate.&nbsp; Whether&nbsp; the&nbsp; authority granted to her was sufficient or not, and&nbsp; whether the estate is bound or not, she must account for the funds and place the same under the disposal of the court that extended the authority to her.&nbsp; This is exactly what&nbsp; the trial court did and we find no&nbsp; reason to disturb its finding.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
