				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> In Special Proceedings No. 163&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of La Union,&nbsp; appellee Severo Viloria was,&nbsp; on October 27, 1948,&nbsp; appointed guardian&nbsp; of the person&nbsp; and estate of&nbsp; the&nbsp; minor&nbsp; Roy Reginald Lelina,&nbsp; beneficiary of arrears&nbsp; in pay, insurance, and other benefits from the U. S. Veterans Administration due to the death of his late father Constancio&nbsp; Lelina,&nbsp; supposedly&nbsp; a&nbsp; member&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; U. S. Armed Forces&nbsp; during the war.&nbsp; On&nbsp; March 31, 1950, the court authorized the guardian to withdraw from the estate of his ward the sum of not to exceed P30 a month for the boy's support and other expenditures. <br><br>On March 20, 1952, the&nbsp; U. S. Veterans Administration filed a motion in&nbsp; the guardianship proceedings,&nbsp; alleging receipt of certain letters&nbsp; from its central office in Washington, D.&nbsp; C., to the&nbsp; effect that the minor's deceased father had no guerrilla or other service in the armed forces of the United States, and that consequently, Ms heir was not entitled to the payment of gratuitous National&nbsp; Service life Insurance, and prayed that the guardian&nbsp; be ordered to stop further payment of monthly allowances to&nbsp; the minor. The court found the motion well-founded and granted the same.&nbsp; A few years later,&nbsp; on February ]5, 1955, the Administrator of Veterans&nbsp; Affairs again filed a motion in the same guardianship proceedings&nbsp; for a refund&nbsp; to the U. S. Veterans Administration of the sum of $2,879.68, the balance of gratuitous insurance benefits allegedly wrongfully paid to&nbsp; the minor&nbsp; Roy Reginald Lelina, which was still on deposit with the Philippine National Bank, San Fernando, La Union Branch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon opposition of the guardian, who submitted&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; service record of the minor's deceased father duly recognized by both the Philippine and U.&nbsp; S. Armies,&nbsp; the motion for&nbsp; refund&nbsp; was denied.&nbsp; Then on Am il&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; the guardian&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; be allowed to withdraw&nbsp; P4,000&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; minor's&nbsp; estate&nbsp; to meet&nbsp; the minors needs.&nbsp; This motion&nbsp; was&nbsp; opposed by the Administrator&nbsp; of Veterans&nbsp; Affairs,&nbsp; arguing&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; minor's right&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; National&nbsp;&nbsp; Service.&nbsp; Life&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; is governed&nbsp; exclusively by&nbsp; the U. S.&nbsp; Code&nbsp; Annotated,&nbsp; which provides&nbsp; (Tit.&nbsp; 38,&nbsp;&nbsp; section&nbsp; 808)&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; decisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Administratorâ€” <br><blockquote>"<i>shall be final and conclusive on all questions of law or fact and no other official of&nbsp; the&nbsp; United States, except a, judge or judges&nbsp; of the United&nbsp; State?, courts,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to review&nbsp; any such decisions;</i>" </blockquote>In the same motion, the&nbsp; Administrator prayed for the&nbsp; set- ting aside of the&nbsp; court's order denying&nbsp; the&nbsp; refund&nbsp; of&nbsp; the money in the&nbsp; hands&nbsp; of the minor's guardian,&nbsp; on the ground of&nbsp; "lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction". <br><br>Acting on the pending motions&nbsp; of the guardian and the Administrator,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; held: <br><blockquote>"If the legal&nbsp; provisions alleged in the petition of the Veterans Administration&nbsp; is correct, and&nbsp; should&nbsp; be taken into account,&nbsp; this Court may&nbsp; not have&nbsp; the right to order&nbsp; the return of the amount of $2,879.68 at present&nbsp; credited&nbsp; as funds of the minor, and deposited in the name of said minor with the Philippine National Bank.&nbsp; Precisely, the&nbsp; issue&nbsp; now&nbsp; pending&nbsp; in this&nbsp; guardianship proceeding&nbsp; is&nbsp; whether or not, the father&nbsp; of&nbsp; the minor the deceased&nbsp; Constancio&nbsp; Lelina,&nbsp; has a valid military service to&nbsp; justify the&nbsp; payment to&nbsp; him&nbsp;&nbsp; or to his heirs&nbsp; of the National Life&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Insurance benefits. The minor Reginald&nbsp; Lelina through&nbsp; his guardian&nbsp; and his&nbsp; counsel claims&nbsp; that his father had&nbsp; rendered services&nbsp; as shown by&nbsp; certain&nbsp; papers&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case to support that claim.&nbsp; As a matter&nbsp; of fact,&nbsp; the said minor was granted and&nbsp; paid those benefits as&nbsp; shown&nbsp; by the statements of accounts submitted and duly approved by&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court up to and&nbsp; including&nbsp; March 31,&nbsp; 1954, in the&nbsp; Order of&nbsp; Judge Primitivo L. Gonzales dated&nbsp; April 22, 1954.&nbsp; On the other hand the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attorneys of the Veterans Administration now&nbsp; claim that such payment was an error&nbsp; because&nbsp; the deceased Constancio Lelina had no recognized&nbsp; military&nbsp; services&nbsp; or&nbsp; was he a member of the Commonwealth&nbsp; Army in&nbsp; the service of the Armed Forces of the United&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States Government.&nbsp; This is, therefore,&nbsp; a&nbsp; matter&nbsp;&nbsp; that should be determined in an&nbsp; appropriate action filed with the competent court.<br><br>This being&nbsp; the case, until this&nbsp; issue is finally&nbsp; determined&nbsp; by the competent court in an appropriate action, the balance of the&nbsp; amount now deposited in the name of the minor throug his guardian could not be disposed by this&nbsp; Court one way or another.&nbsp; In this proceeding, the matter at issue cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; finally&nbsp; determined.&nbsp; Hence, this Court believes and&nbsp; so holds,&nbsp; that in the meantime, the&nbsp; <i>status&nbsp; quo</i> should be maintained with respect&nbsp; to the&nbsp; funds now existing and deposited with the Philippine National Bank, La Union Branch in the name, of the herein minor."&nbsp; (Rec. on Appeal, pp. 47-49) </blockquote>and denied both&nbsp; the guardian's motion to withdraw from the minor's deposits, and the Administrator's position for refund.&nbsp; The Administrator of&nbsp; Veterans&nbsp; Affairs sought reconsideration&nbsp; of the above&nbsp; order,&nbsp; which was denied; wherefore, it appealed to this Court. <br><br>We are&nbsp; of the opinion that the appeal should be&nbsp; rejected. The provisions of the IT.&nbsp; S. Code, invoked by the appellant, make the&nbsp; decisions of&nbsp; U.S. Veteran Administrator final and conclusive&nbsp; when made&nbsp; on claims&nbsp; properly submitted to him for resolution;&nbsp; but they are&nbsp; not applicable&nbsp; to the present case, where the&nbsp; Administrator&nbsp; is not acting as a judge&nbsp; but&nbsp; as a&nbsp; litigant.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; is a great difference between actions against the Administrator&nbsp; (which&nbsp; must be filed strictly in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the conditions that are imposed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Veterans'&nbsp; Act,&nbsp; including&nbsp; the&nbsp; exclusive review by United States&nbsp; courts),&nbsp; and those actions&nbsp; where the&nbsp; Veterans' Administrator&nbsp; seeks&nbsp; a&nbsp; remedy&nbsp; from our courts and submits to&nbsp; their jurisdiction by filing actions therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our attention has&nbsp; not been called&nbsp; to any law or treaty that would make the findings&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Veterans&nbsp; Administrator, in actions&nbsp; where&nbsp; he is a party, conclusive on our courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; That, in effect, would&nbsp; deprive our tribunals of judicial discretion and render them mere subordinate instrumentalities of the&nbsp; Veterans' Administrator. <br><br>In an analogous case,&nbsp; We&nbsp; have ruled: <br><blockquote>"By filing this action of partition in the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, the Philippine Alien Property Administrator has submitted to its jurisdiction and&nbsp; put in&nbsp; issue the legality&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; vesting order.&nbsp; He can&nbsp; not therefore now dispute this&nbsp; power."&nbsp; (Brownell vs.&nbsp; Bautista,&nbsp; 50 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 4772.)</blockquote>From the time the amounts now sought to be recovered were paid to the appellee guardian, for&nbsp; the ward's benefit, the latter became their&nbsp; lawful&nbsp; possessor&nbsp; and he&nbsp; tan not&nbsp; be deprived thereof&nbsp; on the&nbsp; sole&nbsp; allegation of&nbsp; the Veterans' Administrator that the money was erroneously paid.&nbsp; The burden lies upon him to satisfy the court that the alleged mistake was&nbsp; really committed; and the Philippine&nbsp; courts' determination of the&nbsp; question is as binding upon the&nbsp; Veterans'&nbsp; Administrator&nbsp; as&nbsp; upon&nbsp; any&nbsp; other litigant. <br><br>Concerning&nbsp; the claim itself, We&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; the&nbsp; court below that it&nbsp; was not properly filed in the guardianship proceedings, since the latter&nbsp; are solely concerned with the ward's care and custody and the proper administration or management of his properties.&nbsp; Conflicts regarding ownership or title to the property in the hands of the guardian, in his capacity as such,&nbsp; should be litigated in a separate proceeding. <br><br>The order of the court below,&nbsp; dated 22 June 1955, is hereby&nbsp; affirmed, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the&nbsp; appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. .J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp;&nbsp; Conception</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ</span>., concur. </div>
