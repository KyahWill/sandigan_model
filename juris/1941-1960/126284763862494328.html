				<H3>SY SUAN AND PRICE INCORPORATED, PETITIONERS, VS. PABLO L. REGALA, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ENDENCIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal by certiorari&nbsp; against&nbsp; the decision of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; adjudging&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Pablo L.&nbsp; Regala&nbsp; the sum of P6,998.85, with legal interest, said to be the unpaid balance due him from&nbsp; petitioners Sy Suan and Price Incorporated,&nbsp; as a result&nbsp; of their verbal&nbsp; contract whereby the said petitioners agreed to&nbsp; pay 10 % of the value&nbsp; of the licenses which respondent might&nbsp; obtain from&nbsp; the defunct Import Control Commission for the importation of&nbsp; industrial&nbsp; starch for candy manufacture,&nbsp; plus P500 as&nbsp; attorney's fees, and&nbsp; costs.<br><br>The facts of the case&nbsp; as found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on April 11, 1953, defendant Sy&nbsp; Suan, who was at the time president&nbsp; and general manager of his&nbsp; co-defendant [Price Incorporated] and owner&nbsp; of practically all&nbsp; the capital stock of said corporation,&nbsp; executed&nbsp; in favor of plaintiff a special power of attorney authorizing the latter&nbsp; to prosecute the former's applications for import licenses with the Import Control Office per Exhibit 'B.'&nbsp; At the time of the execution of the said power of attorney, defendants&nbsp; had&nbsp; pending' in the Import Control Office the following applications:&nbsp; Application No. 001705 for industrial starch&nbsp; in the sum of $16,477.34 filed on&nbsp; April 6, 1953&nbsp; in the name of&nbsp; defendant, Price Incorporated; Application&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 001797 for industrial starch in the sum of&nbsp; $21,678.48&nbsp; filed on April 6, 1953 in the name of defendant Price Incorporated; and Application No.&nbsp; 001800 for industrial starch in the sum of $15,778.11 filed on Aprils, 1953 in the name of&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Price Incorporated (Exh, 'A').&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to said special power&nbsp; of attorney, plaintiff followed up&nbsp; and prosecuted&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-mentioned applications with and through&nbsp; the different offices&nbsp; and divisions of&nbsp; the Import&nbsp; Control Office,&nbsp; conferring with&nbsp; the corresponding&nbsp; Import&nbsp; Control&nbsp; officials. On&nbsp; or about May&nbsp; 19, 1953, the Import Control&nbsp; Office issued the following licenses as&nbsp; a result of&nbsp; the effort made by the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; plaintiff: license No. 15030 on&nbsp; Application No. 001795;&nbsp; License&nbsp; No. 15029 of Application No. 001797; and License&nbsp; No. 15028 on Application No. 001800, the amount&nbsp; of which had been reduced to $11,888.50.<br><br>"Shortly before&nbsp; the&nbsp; execution of the special power&nbsp; of attorney above referred to, plaintiff&nbsp; and defendant Sy Suan agreed verbally that&nbsp; plaintiff's services for&nbsp; securing the said&nbsp; licenses&nbsp; would be paid&nbsp; or compensated with&nbsp; ten&nbsp; (10%)&nbsp; per cent&nbsp; of the total value of the&nbsp; amounts approved&nbsp; on the said applications.&nbsp; On May 19, 1953, upon&nbsp; the release of&nbsp; the aforementioned&nbsp; licenses, defendants paid&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P3,000.00 on&nbsp; account of the latter's services."<br></blockquote>Under the facts&nbsp; above set forth&nbsp; and&nbsp; from the briefs submitted, the main issue&nbsp; in this appeal&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; validity of the parole&nbsp; contract of remuneration which petitioners assail as&nbsp; contravening&nbsp; public policy&nbsp; and interest, hence null and void <i>ab initio.</i><br><br>Petitioners argue that the 10% commission sought by respondent and&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals is&nbsp; inimical&nbsp; to&nbsp; public policy&nbsp; in that it tends to&nbsp; increase&nbsp; the cost&nbsp; of production&nbsp; of candies which&nbsp; they&nbsp; manufacture; that this&nbsp; increase&nbsp; will&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; be passed on to&nbsp; the consuming public by way of increased prices, thus frustrating the avowed purpose of the government to lighten the burden&nbsp; of the people and to place essential consumers goods such as candies within the reach of the masses; that&nbsp; if the giving of 10%&nbsp; to intermediaries&nbsp; in&nbsp; the procurement of import&nbsp; licenses is sanctioned, this practice would serve as a deterrent, rather than an incentive, to the&nbsp; creation of&nbsp; new&nbsp; industries encouraged&nbsp; by&nbsp; the government,&nbsp; as it would syphon off a substantial percentage of the capital&nbsp; invested by the fledging&nbsp; industries&nbsp; to the private pockets of so-called "tenpercenters;" and that inasmuch as&nbsp; the granting of licenses&nbsp; depends&nbsp; solely upon the&nbsp; merits&nbsp; of&nbsp; each application, the&nbsp; intervention of&nbsp; such intermediaries&nbsp; would&nbsp; tend to influence&nbsp; and&nbsp; corrupt the judgment of the government agencies processing the application.<br><br>Against this argument, respondent claims that the contract in question is not violative of sound public policy; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; contract&nbsp; should not be&nbsp; declared void as against public policy except when the cases is clear and free from doubt and the&nbsp; injury to the public is substantial and not theoretical or problematical; that the usual and most important function of courts of justice is rather to maintain and&nbsp; enforce contracts&nbsp; than to enable&nbsp; parties thereto&nbsp; to escape their obligation&nbsp; on the&nbsp; pretext&nbsp; of public policy, unless it clearly appears that they contravene&nbsp; public right or public welfare;&nbsp; and that contracts,&nbsp; when entered into freely and&nbsp; voluntarily, should be enforced&nbsp; by courts&nbsp; of justice.<br><br>Upon careful consideration of the contentions of&nbsp; both parties, we find&nbsp; undeniable that the contract in question sought to be enforced by the respondent and assailed by petitioners as null and void for being against public policy, is what is commonly .known as 10% contracts' which the press decries and the public condemns as inimical to public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can&nbsp; take judicial notice that this kind&nbsp; of contract&nbsp; sprouted as&nbsp; a result of the controls&nbsp; imposed by the government on imports and dollar allocations, despite the enunciated government&nbsp; policy that&nbsp; applications&nbsp; for imports and foreign exchange should be considered&nbsp; and acted upon&nbsp; strictly on&nbsp; the&nbsp; basis of merit of each&nbsp; application and without the intervention of intermediaries, which policy is revealed by Sections 15 and 18 of Republic Act 650 which read:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 15. The president may&nbsp; summarily&nbsp; bar&nbsp; firms or individuals from&nbsp; filing applications for import and/or from doing business in the Philippines for any of the following acts:<br><br>"1.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *. <br>"2.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *. <br>"3.&nbsp; The payment to any public official, directly or indirectly, of any fee, premium&nbsp; or compensation&nbsp; other than&nbsp; those allowed&nbsp; by laws&nbsp; or&nbsp; regulations,&nbsp; in connection with the issuance&nbsp; or granting of quota allocations&nbsp; or licenses."<br><br>"SEC, 18. The penalty or fine&nbsp; of not less than" two thousand&nbsp; pesos (P2,000)&nbsp; nor more than twenty thousand pesos (P20,000)&nbsp; or imprisonment&nbsp; of not&nbsp; less than two years&nbsp; nor&nbsp; more&nbsp; than&nbsp; five years, or both&nbsp; such fine and imprisonment at the&nbsp; discretion of the Court shall&nbsp; be imposed upon persons who may&nbsp; he&nbsp; found guilty of the following acts:<br><br>"1.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *.<br>"2.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *.<br>"3.&nbsp; The receiving or accepting by any public official&nbsp; or employee directly or indirectly, of&nbsp; fees,&nbsp; premiums or compensation&nbsp; of any kind other than those allowed by law or by the rules&nbsp; and&nbsp; regulations, for the performance of any act&nbsp; or&nbsp; service&nbsp; connected&nbsp; with the issuance of import license or quota allocation."<br></blockquote>If&nbsp; the granting of&nbsp; import&nbsp; licenses or&nbsp; quota allocations depended solely upon the merits of&nbsp; each application, there being a prohibition to&nbsp; firms or&nbsp; individuals&nbsp; applying for such&nbsp; licenses or quota allocations&nbsp; from paying&nbsp; "to&nbsp; any public official, directly or indirectly, of any fee, premium or&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; other than those allowed by law or&nbsp; regulations, in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with the issuance or granting of quota&nbsp; allocations&nbsp; or&nbsp; licenses,"&nbsp; and&nbsp; these&nbsp; officials&nbsp; are equally&nbsp; prohibited from "receiving or accepting,&nbsp; directly or&nbsp; indirectly, of fees, premiums or compensations of&nbsp; any kind&nbsp; other than those allowed by law or&nbsp; by,the rules&nbsp; and regulations,&nbsp; for the performance of any&nbsp; act&nbsp; or service connected with the issuance&nbsp; of import&nbsp; license or&nbsp; quota allocation,"&nbsp; certainly the intervention&nbsp; of intermediaries, such&nbsp; as herein respondent, would be unwarranted&nbsp; and uncalled for,&nbsp; as such intervention would not render an unmeritorious application deserving, nor&nbsp; undeserving applications meritorious, but would serve no&nbsp; other purpose than&nbsp; to influence,&nbsp; or possibly corrupt,&nbsp; in&nbsp; unmeritorious cases, the judgment&nbsp; of the public official or officials&nbsp; performing an act or service connected with the&nbsp; issuance of&nbsp; Impart&nbsp; license&nbsp; or quota&nbsp;&nbsp; allocation—an&nbsp; eventuality Which the law precisely sought to avoid.<br><br>The present case is&nbsp; similar to that of Mathew S. Tee <i>vs.</i> Tacloban&nbsp;&nbsp; Electric &amp;&nbsp; Ice Plant&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> L-11980, February 14, 1959.&nbsp; In&nbsp; that&nbsp; case,&nbsp; Mathew S. Tee was approached by the agents of the Tacloban&nbsp; Electric for him to secure dollar&nbsp; allocation from&nbsp; the Central Bank for the&nbsp; company,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the "standard fee" of 10% of the value of the allocation obtained.&nbsp; Tee filed the necessary papers, followed them up for six months, and&nbsp; finally obtained the&nbsp; allocation&nbsp; of&nbsp; $243,500.00&nbsp; for the company.&nbsp; Upon failure to collect his 10%, Tee filed the appropriate action with the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; where&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; moved to&nbsp; dismiss the complaint, which was granted, on&nbsp; the ground that the contract was null and&nbsp; void&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> as being against public morals and public policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal, we&nbsp; sustained the dismissal and&nbsp; held that said contract was&nbsp; really contrary to&nbsp; good customs/ public order&nbsp; and public policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The doctrine laid down in that case is certainly applicable to the present, as both involve the collection of&nbsp; 10% of the value of the license that may have been obtained.<br><br>Respondent claims, however, that there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no evidence showing that the contract in question has&nbsp; violated&nbsp; any public policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not agree to this, as the very contract in question is self-evident.&nbsp; As we have cited in the aforementioned case.<br><blockquote>"It is a general rule that agreements against&nbsp; public policy are illegal and void.&nbsp; Under the principles&nbsp; relating to the doctrine of public policy, as applied to the law of contracts, courts of justice will not recognize or uphold any transaction which, in its object operation, or tendency, is calculated to be prejudicial to the public welfare, to sound morality, or to civic honesty.&nbsp; The test is&nbsp; whether the parties&nbsp; have stipulated for something inhibited by&nbsp; the law or inimical&nbsp; to, or inconsistent with,&nbsp; the public&nbsp; welfare.&nbsp; An agreement is against public policy if it is&nbsp; injurious to the interests of the public, contravenes some established interest of society, violates some public statute, is against&nbsp; good morals, ends to interfere with the public welfare or&nbsp; society, or as it is sometimes put, if it is at war with the interests of society and is in conflict with the morals of the time.&nbsp; An agreement&nbsp; either to do anything&nbsp; which, or not to do anything the omission of which,&nbsp; is in&nbsp; any degree clearly injurious&nbsp; to the&nbsp; public and an&nbsp; agreement of such a nature that it cannot be&nbsp; carried&nbsp; into&nbsp; execution without&nbsp; reaching&nbsp; beyond the parties&nbsp; and exercising an injurious influence&nbsp; over the community at large are against public policy.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; many things which the law does not prohibit, in the sense of attaching&nbsp; penalties, but which&nbsp; are so&nbsp; mischievous&nbsp; in their nature&nbsp; and tendency&nbsp; that&nbsp; on grounds of public policy they cannot be admitted&nbsp; as&nbsp; the subject of a valid contract.&nbsp; The question whether a contract is against public policy depends upon&nbsp; its purpose and&nbsp; tendency, and&nbsp; not upon the fact that&nbsp; no harm&nbsp; result from it.&nbsp; In other words, all&nbsp; agreements the purpose.of&nbsp; which is to create a situation&nbsp; which tends to operate to the detriment of the&nbsp; public&nbsp; interest&nbsp; are against&nbsp; public policy and void,&nbsp; whether in the&nbsp; particular case the purpose&nbsp; of the agreement is or is not effectuated.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">For a particular undertaking&nbsp; to be against public policy actual injury need not be shown; it is enough if the potentialities for harm are present."</span>&nbsp; (12 Am. Jur., pp. 662-664)<br></blockquote>On the other hand,&nbsp; Articles 1306&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1409&nbsp; of the new Civil Code provide:<br><blockquote>"ART. 1306. The&nbsp; contracting parties&nbsp; may&nbsp; establish&nbsp; such&nbsp; stipulations, clauses, terms and&nbsp; conditions as&nbsp; they, may deem convenient provided they are not.contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or&nbsp; public policy."<br><br>"ART. 1409. The following contracts&nbsp; are inexistent and void from the beginning:<br><br>(1) Those whose&nbsp; cause,&nbsp; object or&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; is&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; to&nbsp; law, morals, good customs, public order or public&nbsp; policy."<br></blockquote>Wherefore, the&nbsp;&nbsp; decision&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; is hereby reversed, without costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Barrera, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Supra</span>, p. 168.</div>
