				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> In civil case No. 53926 of&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; entitled "Perfecto M. Alejo <i>vs.</i> Pablo&nbsp; S. Sison," for a&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; money, the plaintiff procured a writ of preliminary&nbsp; attachment which was&nbsp; levied upon&nbsp; the personalties&nbsp; of the defendant.&nbsp; The herein appellant Visayan Surety and Insurance Corporation executed&nbsp; a bond&nbsp; of P1,000 "under the condition that&nbsp; it and the plaintiff will pay all costs&nbsp; which may be&nbsp; adjudged to the defendant&nbsp; Pablo S. Sison, and all damages which the said defendant&nbsp; may sustain by reason of the attachment if the same shall finally be adjudged to have been&nbsp; wrongful or without&nbsp; sufficient cause."&nbsp;&nbsp; After the trial of the case&nbsp; on the merits, Judge Sixto de la Costa, on November 27, 1940, dismissed the complaint with costs against the plaintiff.&nbsp; Thereafter, and on March 24,&nbsp; 1941, the attorneys for the defendant presented a bill of costs aggregating P934.04, the largest&nbsp; items of which were the following:<br><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="60%">Clerk's fees <i>in re</i> guarding&nbsp; of defendant'schattels&nbsp; (Exhs. "21" to "21-h")&nbsp; ..........</td> <td width="15%"><div align="right">P813.00</div></td> <td width="25%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Ditto <i>in re</i> storage of defendant's&nbsp; automobile (Exh. "23")........................&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td> <td><div align="right">91.60</div></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Copy&nbsp; of said bill of costs&nbsp; Was served on the attorney for the plaintiff on the same date, March 24,&nbsp; 1941.&nbsp;&nbsp; A week later, that is to say, on March 31, 1941, the&nbsp; defendant petitioned the court&nbsp; for&nbsp; the issuance of&nbsp; a writ of execution against&nbsp; the plaintiff "in accordance with the judgment rendered by this&nbsp; court on November 27, 1940, and the bill of costs&nbsp; filed."&nbsp;&nbsp; That petition was granted by Judge&nbsp; de la Costa "como se pide."&nbsp; On April&nbsp; 8, 1941, the clerk of court sent a notice to the attorneys for both parties setting the bill of costs for hearing before him on April&nbsp; 15, 1941, at 9:30&nbsp; a.m.&nbsp; It does not appear that&nbsp; either&nbsp; the plaintiff or his attorney objected then or at any other&nbsp; time to any of the items of the&nbsp; bill&nbsp; of&nbsp; costs presented by the defendant. Evidently the clerk of court taxed the costs as claimed by the defendant, from which taxation&nbsp; of costs the plaintiff did not appeal to the court; for a writ of execution was thereafter&nbsp; issued against the plaintiff&nbsp; to enforce the&nbsp; collection of the costs.&nbsp; That writ, however, was subsequently returned unsatisfied by the sheriff, who reported that the plaintiff was insolvent.<br><br>Thereafter, and on May 5, 1941, the herein appellee Benedicto&nbsp; Javier, as assignee of&nbsp; the defendant, presented a motion in court for the issuance of a writ of execution against the appellant Visayan Surety&nbsp; and Insurance Corporation, as plaintiff's bondsman, to make good its bond above mentioned.&nbsp; That motion was opposed by the Visayan&nbsp; Surety and Insurance Corporation, which contested the legality of the two items of costs hereinbefore set forth.&nbsp; Judge Jose R. Carlos, in his order dated May 21, 1941, overruled the opposition and granted Benedicto Javier's&nbsp; motion for the issuance of&nbsp; a writ of execution against the herein appellant.&nbsp; Hence this appeal.<br><br>The appellant insists&nbsp; that the trial court should have sustained appellant's objection to the inclusion in the bill of costs of&nbsp; the expenses&nbsp; defrayed by the defendant&nbsp; for guarding his chattels&nbsp; and for the storage&nbsp; of his automobile in connection with the maintenance of&nbsp; the attachment thereon.<br><br>Section 8&nbsp; of Rule 131 of the Rules of Court provides as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 8.—<i>Costs,&nbsp; how&nbsp; taxed.</i>—In inferior&nbsp; courts,&nbsp; the costs shall be taxed by the justice of the peace or municipal judge and included&nbsp; in the judgment.&nbsp; In superior&nbsp; courts, costs shall be taxed by the clerk on five days' written notice given by the prevailing party to the&nbsp; adverse party. With&nbsp; this notice shall be served a statement of the items of costs claimed by the prevailing party,&nbsp; verified&nbsp; by his oath or that of his attorney.&nbsp; Objections to the taxation shall be made in writing, specifying the items objected to. Either party may appeal to the court from&nbsp; the clerk's taxation.&nbsp; The costs shall be&nbsp; inserted in the judgment if taxed before its entry, and payment thereof shall&nbsp; be enforced by execution."</blockquote>The plaintiff,&nbsp; in whose shoes the appellant now stands, aside&nbsp; from the&nbsp; reglementary five&nbsp; days' notice&nbsp; given him by the defendant, was given by the clerk of court another notice of a hearing on the taxation of the costs, but did not avail himself of the opportunity to present any objection thereto.&nbsp; Neither did he appeal to the court from the clerk's taxation.<br><br>Altho section 8 of Rule&nbsp; 131 above quoted does not fix the time within which either party may&nbsp; appeal to the court from the clerk's taxation, we cannot regard appellant's objection to appellee's motion for the issuance of a&nbsp; writ of execution- against appellant as&nbsp; an appeal,&nbsp; and much less as a timely appeal, from the clerk's taxation to the court. The appellant surety or its principal,&nbsp; the plaintiff, should have presented the appeal expressly, in due&nbsp; form, and within a reasonable time.&nbsp; We fix five days from the date of notice of the clerk's taxation&nbsp; as a reasonable time within which to present such appeal.<br><br>Since the clerk's taxation of costs had become&nbsp; final, it was no longer reviewable by the court when appellant presented&nbsp; its objection thereto in connection with its&nbsp; opposition to appellee's motion for the issuance of a writ of execution.<br><br>The&nbsp; order&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed, without any&nbsp; finding as to costs in this instance wherein appellee entered no appearance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Yulo, C. J., Moran, Paras</i>, and <i>Bocobo, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
