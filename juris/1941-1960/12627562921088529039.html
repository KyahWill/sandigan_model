				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order  issued by the  Court of First Instance of Bulacan dismissing the complaint filed by plaintiffs against defendants. <br><br>Raymundo Sto. Domingo contracted two marriages, the first with Juana Dilag  out of which Urbana was born, and the second with Pilar  Evangelista, the game having produced Leoncia as the only issue.   Raymundo Sto, Domingo died on May 1, 1935.  Days before his death, he executed a deed of donation of his properties in  favor of his daughter Urbana  in  the  first marriage  which  was accepted  and the properties were placed in the possession of the donee. When Raymundo died, the heirs surviving him were Urbana Sto. Domingo, daughter in the first marriage, Leoncia Sto. Domingo, daughter in the second, and his widow Pilar Evangelista, mother of  the latter. On March  10, 1936, Urbana Sto. Domingo sold the  properties donated to her by  her deceased father  to one  Deogracias Matias.  The deed of sale was duly registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Bulacan who subsequently issued in favor of the vendee the corresponding certificate of title." <br><br>Subsequent to the sale above referred to, there followed a series of litigations involving the annulment of the deed of donation and of the deed of  sale.   The first was  Civil Case. No. 5315 instituted in  the Court of  First Instance of Bulacan by Pilar Evangelista, the  widow, in her behalf and as guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem </span>of her minor daughter Leoncia Sto. Domingo  against Urbana  Sto.  Domingo  and  Deogracias Matias  wherein  they  alleged  that  the  donation as well as the sale  of the properties  of the deceased were fictitious and therefore null and void.  The complaint was filed on August 28, 1936.  Defendants therein interposed a demurrer which was overruled.  After issues were joined by the filing of their answer, the case  was amicably settled, the  parties  filing a motion  asking for the dismissal of the case. As a result of such settlement, plaintiffs received the sum of  P1,000.00 by way  of compromise.  The  settlement was approved by the court and the case was dismissed.<br><br>After the lapse  of  twenty-two months, or to be exact, on October 7, 1938, the same widow, who in the meantime married one Aquilino Robes, in her own  behalf and as guardian  <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> of  her minor child  Leoncia, again instituted  another  action in the  same court praying for the identical relief concerning the annulment of  the donation and sale of  the properties involved, in the first case against  the same  defendants.  The latter  answered interposing  the  same defenses.  This case was again  dismissed on  petition of plaintiffs who were  not  ready to go to  trial but without prejudice  to reviving the case if they so desired.                   <br><br>In the meantime, intestate proceedings for the settlement of the estate of the late  Raymundo Sto. Domingo were instituted and one Severino Alberto was appointed administrator of the estate.  This administrator  on February 22, 1954 filed a complaint  against the same defendants for the annulment of the same deed of donation and sale based  on the  same ground  that  they were executed through fraud and  without  consideration. Defendants moved to dismiss the  complaint  on the ground of lack of legal capacity to  sue  on the  part of the plaintiff. The motion was sustained  and the  case was  dismissed. <br><br>And  now comes the present case which  was instituted by  the  same  widow  in her  personal  capacity   and  as guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad  litem</span> of her  daughter Leoncia against the same defendants seeking the annulment of the same deed of donation and sale based  on the same grounds of fraud and lack of consideration.  This time defendants filed  a motion to dismiss  based on the  grounds, among others, that (1)  the cause of action has  already prescribed and (2) that the cause of action is already barred by a prior judgment. The court  found this motion well  founded and dismissed  the  complaint.   Plaintiffs  took   the  present appeal  to  the Court of Appeals which  was certified  to us on the ground that only questions of law are involved. <br><br>The appeal must  be dismissed.  It appears that prior to the present  case  there  were three others that were instituted, two by the same plaintiff herein,  and one  by the judicial administrator of the Estate of the late Raymundo Sto. Domingo. The first case was instituted on August 28, 1936 by Pilar Evangelista, widow of the deceased, in her own behalf and as guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> of her minor daughter Leoncia Sto. Domingo, which was amicably settled and the settlement was duly approved by the court. To the motion submitted to the court by the parties praying for its dismissal, there was attached an  affidavit signed by the widow wherein she acknowledged having voluntarily entered into an amicable settlement  of the case, and in this settlement she acted not only in her personal capacity but as guardian ad litem  of her minor  daughter. It also appears that she agreed to the settlement after receiving the sum  of P1,000.00 by way of compromise.  The order approving the settlement  become final for lack  of appeal on the part of either party.  As  a  matter of fact,  the second was filed by the same plaintiffs twenty-two months thereafter and the same was also dismissed. Considering that the  present case  involves the same  parties and  the same issues as those involved and raised in the first case, the conclusion is  inescapable  that the present  case  is already barred by a prior judgment. <br><br>The  fact that one of the party-litigants is a minor is of no moment, for  she had been represented  right along by her guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem.</span>  This is recognized by our Rules of Court which provide that "A minor  * * *  may sue  or be sued through his  guardian, or if he  has none, through a guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> appointed by the court"  (Section 5, Rule 3).   It cannot also be contended that because  the minor was merely represented by a guardian ad litem, said guardian  cannot bind  the  minor with  regard  to  the amicable settlement. The rule is well settled that "If * * * the compromise was considered and <span style="font-style: italic;">sanctioned by the court </span> and was  rendered on testimony in addition  to the admission  or confession  of the guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span>, the judgment will  not afterward be set aside where there was no fraud, in its procurement"   (43  C.J.S.,  344;  Italics supplied).  Ordinarily, it is  true, a guardian  <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> has no  authority to  act or bind  a minor in any transaction with regard to his estate, but he can  however  do so with the approval of  the court.  This  is what was done in the present  case: <br><blockquote>"Ordinarily  his (referring  to the guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem's</span>) authority is recognized only for certain specific purposes, and  it is restricted to matters connected with the litigation at hand; he has no authority to act in any other matters and he cannot otherwise bind the infant or his estate;  and  it has been held that he cannot bind the infant by anything that he may do, except with the consent of the court." (43 C.J.S., 299) </blockquote>Wherefore,  the  order  appealed  from  is affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
