				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Francisca Celis&nbsp; was charged&nbsp; with&nbsp; slander in&nbsp; the Municipal Court of Manila, in a complaint&nbsp; subscribed and sworn to on 7 July 1955 by Dominga B. Mutya and&nbsp; filed&nbsp; on 12 July&nbsp; 1955, committed as follows: <br><blockquote>That on or about the 9th&nbsp; day of&nbsp; June, 1955, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused did&nbsp; then&nbsp; and there willfully, unlawfully&nbsp; and feloniously and publicly utter and proffer&nbsp; slanderous words and expressions against the undersigned&nbsp; complainant&nbsp; such as "Puta ka&nbsp; ina-asawa&nbsp; ka ng asawa ko&nbsp; sa cuarto namin.&nbsp; Akala mo hindi na ako&nbsp; babalik kaya ikao pumatol sa asawa ko," and other expressions of similar import, thereby bringing the said undersigned into public contempt,&nbsp; disgrace,&nbsp; dishonor&nbsp; and ridicule,&nbsp; (Case No. D-45987.) </blockquote>Upon arraignment,&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; entered a plea of not guilty and after&nbsp; trial the court&nbsp; found her&nbsp; guilty of slander as provided for&nbsp; in Article 35S of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced her to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; a fine&nbsp; of P100,&nbsp; with&nbsp; subsidiary imprisonment&nbsp; in case&nbsp; of insolvency,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the costs.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; appealed to the Court of&nbsp; First Instance where it was docketed as Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 32104. <br><blockquote>The defendant was arraigned under the same&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; filed in the Municipal Court and again she entered a plea&nbsp; of&nbsp; not guilty. The&nbsp; offended&nbsp; party Dominga B.&nbsp; Mutya&nbsp; testified that on&nbsp; June 9, 1955 at about 2:00 o'clock in&nbsp; the&nbsp; afternoon while she was in&nbsp; her room at the&nbsp; second floor of the house situated at 2531 E. Fernandez, Tocson, Tondo,&nbsp; Manila, she was called by her landlady&nbsp; Dionisia Tiongson who said that the accused was uttering bad words against her.&nbsp; When&nbsp; she&nbsp; went down and asked&nbsp; why,&nbsp; the accused told&nbsp; hey "Nagmamaangmangan ka pa.&nbsp; Hindi&nbsp; ba ina-asawa ka&nbsp; ng asawa ko sa cuarto namin?&nbsp; Akala mo&nbsp; yata hindi na ako babalik kaya ka pumatol sa asawa ko." These words, translated into English, mean "You pretend to be innocent.&nbsp; Is it not true that my husband was having&nbsp; sexual&nbsp; intercourse with you&nbsp; in our&nbsp; bedroom?&nbsp; Probably, you thought that I would not come back,&nbsp; that is why&nbsp; you acceded to the&nbsp; desires of my husband."&nbsp; These words were uttered&nbsp; publicly and&nbsp; in&nbsp; a&nbsp; loud voice in the presence&nbsp; of Letieia Torres,&nbsp; Fordeliza Limjeuco and Dionisia Tiongson, the landlady of&nbsp; the offended party. The&nbsp; offended party answered&nbsp; "Baka ikaw," meaning "May be you fire the one."&nbsp; Whereupon, the accused&nbsp; grabbed&nbsp; the offended&nbsp; party by the hair.&nbsp; At this juncture, the husband of the&nbsp; accused arrived and&nbsp; separated the&nbsp; combatants.&nbsp; He brought&nbsp; the accused to their house which was just behind&nbsp; the&nbsp; residence of&nbsp; the&nbsp; offended party. In their house, the accused kept on uttering bad and insulting words against the&nbsp; offended party in the&nbsp; presence of their neighbors who gathered in.&nbsp; front of the&nbsp; house listening to her. <br><br>At 4:00 o'clock that afternoon,&nbsp; the husband of the accused who owns a jeep for hire was driving the&nbsp; jeep.&nbsp; Upon passing&nbsp; in front of the residence of the offended party who was then in the dress shop on the first floor of the house&nbsp; where she was residing,&nbsp; the husband of&nbsp; the accused turn his face towards the dress&nbsp; shop.&nbsp; He was seen by the accused who immediately shouted the following words "Talagang&nbsp; hindi maaring&nbsp; hindi ka&nbsp; lumingon sa puta," which words, translated into&nbsp; English, mean "It&nbsp; is really impossible&nbsp; for&nbsp; you&nbsp; not to look at the prostitute." Following the uttering&nbsp; of those words, the accused went in front of the dress shop where the offended party was&nbsp; and said, referring&nbsp; to tlie offended party "Talagang makapal ang mukha ng babaeng iyan," which, translated into English, mean<br><br>"That woman is really shameless."&nbsp; The offended party told her to come nearer if what she was saying was true.&nbsp; The accused answered "I will and why not?&nbsp; I really saw my husband having sexual intercourse with you in our room."&nbsp; These words were uttered&nbsp; in the presence of many&nbsp; persons.<br><br>After the accused&nbsp; (the complainant)&nbsp; was cross-examined, counsel for&nbsp; the accused, after conferring with her, manifested that it is the desire of the accused to withdraw her plea of not guilty and to substitute it with a plea of&nbsp; guilty and made a motion to that effect. The court granted the&nbsp; motion and, upon re-arraignment,&nbsp; the accused pleaded guilty to the&nbsp; information.&nbsp; (Decision of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance.) </blockquote>Whereupon the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; found&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of serious oral defamation&nbsp; and sentenced her to 4 months and 1 day of&nbsp; <i>arresto mayor </i>and&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay the costs.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; has&nbsp; appealed,&nbsp; assigning&nbsp; the&nbsp; following&nbsp; errors claimed&nbsp; to have&nbsp; been committed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the trial court: <br><blockquote><ol><li> The trial court erred in finding the accused guilty of tlie offense of serious oral defamation&nbsp; instead of&nbsp; simple defamation penalized Â¦under Article 358&nbsp; of the Revised Penal Code. <br></li><li> The&nbsp; Court erred in imposing&nbsp; on&nbsp; the defendant appellant the penalty of&nbsp; four months&nbsp; and one day of arresto mayor. </li></ol></blockquote>The appellant contends&nbsp; that the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; subscribed and sworn to by the offended&nbsp; party charged only slight or simple slander as provided for in&nbsp; the last clause of article 358 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code, because according to her it was filed in&nbsp; the Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; where&nbsp; after trial she was found guilty and sentenced to pay&nbsp; a fine of P100, with subsidiary imprisonment, and costs; that&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal the Court of First Instance could&nbsp; not&nbsp; find her guilty of&nbsp; a more serious offense,&nbsp; because according to her if the complaint charged a more serious crime the Municipal&nbsp; Court did not have jurisdiction to try, convict and sentence her for such more serious offense; and that the Court of First Instance as&nbsp; an appellate&nbsp; court, had jurisdiction&nbsp; only to dismiss the appeal&nbsp; and the complaint filed in&nbsp; the Municipal Court and not to&nbsp; try her&nbsp; upon such complaint. <br><br>What confers jurisdiction upon a court to try,&nbsp; convict and&nbsp; sentence a&nbsp; defendant is not&nbsp; the filing of a complaint or information but the crime charged therein.&nbsp; The facts pleaded in the&nbsp; complaint filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; case&nbsp; charged&nbsp; the crime of slander as defined and punished in the first clause of article 358 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The Municipal Court did not have jurisdiction to try the appellant upon the complaint filed by the offended party.&nbsp; Its verdict&nbsp; and sentence are null&nbsp; and void for&nbsp; lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; The appellant should have raised in the Court of First Instance the question&nbsp; of nullity of the verdict&nbsp; and sentence;&nbsp; but instead&nbsp; of doing so she entered a plea of not guilty when arraigned and&nbsp; went ahead without objection&nbsp; with&nbsp; the trial, and after the offended party had testified she offered to withdraw&nbsp; her plea of not guilty to enter one of guilty, upon&nbsp; which&nbsp; the sentence appealed from was&nbsp; rendered. The&nbsp; trial court entered upon&nbsp; and exercised its original jurisdiction when&nbsp; it tried and sentenced the appellant. <br><br>There being no modifying circumstance the penalty to be imposed is in its medium period, or 1 year and 1&nbsp; day to 1 year and 8 months of <i>prision correctional</i>; and pursuant to the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum penalty&nbsp; is 1&nbsp; month and 1 day of <i>arresto&nbsp; mayor</i> and&nbsp; the maximum, 1 year and 8 months of <i>prision correctional</i>,&nbsp; and the accessories of the law. Modified as to penalty only the sentence appealed from is affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the appellant. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Bengzon, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A., Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador,&nbsp; Conception, Reyes, J.
