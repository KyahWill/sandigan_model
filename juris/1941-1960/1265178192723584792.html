				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is an appeal&nbsp; through certiorari&nbsp; from the order of December 21, 1954 of Judge Jose Bautista, now presiding&nbsp; Judge of&nbsp; the Court of&nbsp; Industrial&nbsp; Relations (CIR) dismissing the complaint filed against the Asia Printing and/or&nbsp; Lu Ming&nbsp; for unfair labor practices as&nbsp; well as the resolution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the CIR&nbsp; en bane&nbsp; of January 20, 1955, denying the motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; order of Judge Bautista.<p>Francisco&nbsp; Dacanay was employed as pressman in&nbsp; the printing establishment of the Asia&nbsp; Printing managed by Lu Ming.&nbsp; On August 23, 1953, he was dismissed&nbsp; according to him,&nbsp; because&nbsp; of his union activities&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Union of Printing Workers, of which he was a member. Charges were filed by&nbsp; petitioner against the&nbsp; printing establishment and its manager with the CIR. Judge Bautista designated&nbsp; Atty. M.&nbsp; A. Ferrer,&nbsp; acting prosecutor of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court, to conduct&nbsp; an investigation.&nbsp; Finding&nbsp; a prima facie case, Ferrer filed the corresponding complaint against the Asia Printing and its manager Lu Ming with the CIR and Judge Bautista&nbsp; held hearings at which both parties, complainant and respondents adduced its evidence.</p><p>In his order Annex "F" dismissing the complaint, Judge Bautista found that Dacanay was not dismissed due to his union activities but was&nbsp; separated&nbsp; as claimed by the respondent because of inefficiency, incompetence, lack of interest ik his work and for being troublesome, having guarded with a number of his co-employees.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his petition for&nbsp; certiorari, Dacanay&nbsp; raised&nbsp; the following questions:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"<em>1st</em>. That the trial court had no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; and abused its discretion&nbsp; after&nbsp; the "Charges" for&nbsp; unfair labor practices were already proved by the&nbsp; Union before&nbsp; the CIR&nbsp; Commissioner, and erred by&nbsp; directing the Union to give&nbsp; evidence again before&nbsp; him, a procedure not sanctioned by any law;&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>2nd.</em> That the trial&nbsp; court erred in adopting&nbsp; a procedure not provided for by Republic Act&nbsp; 875 by not itself directly hearing the complainant union's "charges"&nbsp; instead of a so-called "perliminary investigation" by a CIR&nbsp; Commissioner,&nbsp; said procedure transforming the Court into an Inquisitor, Prosecutor and&nbsp; Judge in one; instead of being a Court only;&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>3rd.</em> That the records&nbsp; of the investigating Commissioner, being public documents, exposed unnecessarily the evidence of the complainant union so that the employer respondent knew in advance the evidence of the complainant to the disadvantage of the complainant union;&nbsp; </p><p>"<em>4th.</em> That the established&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; in&nbsp; unfair labor practices as decreed in sections 5 and 6 of Republic Act 875 do not require&nbsp; any so-called "preliminary investigation" unlike&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal proceedings,&nbsp; but an investigation by the Court&nbsp; (or&nbsp; duly&nbsp; designated&nbsp; Judge) who shall decide thereon the Court itself&nbsp; or&nbsp; issued&nbsp; an&nbsp; enjoining&nbsp; order&nbsp; if necessary to prevent&nbsp; further&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; labor&nbsp; practices." </p></blockquote><p>In the instant proceeding, Dacanay advances the theory that assuming that the investigation conducted by Acting&nbsp; Prosecutor,&nbsp; Ferrer,&nbsp; was proper and&nbsp; legal, after&nbsp; finding&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondents were&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; unfair&nbsp; labor&nbsp; practices for having dismissed&nbsp; him for his&nbsp; union activities,&nbsp; then on the basis of said findings of the prosecutor, the CIR&nbsp; should have rendered judgment&nbsp; in&nbsp; his favor, ordering respondents to reinstate him and to pay his backwages. It is obvious&nbsp; that this contention&nbsp; is&nbsp; untenable.&nbsp; In the first&nbsp; place, according to the respondents, the investigation conducted by Ferer was "ex parte". Respondent were never given an opportunity&nbsp; to be present and to take part in&nbsp; said&nbsp; investigation and present&nbsp; their&nbsp; side. That&nbsp; may&nbsp; be the reason why Ferrer found a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie </span>case against them.&nbsp; Furthermore, said finding that respondents were guilty of unfair&nbsp; labor practice was only <em>"prima facie</em>",&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; made&nbsp; only by&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecutor&nbsp; and not&nbsp; by&nbsp; the CIR itself. Consequently, it could not be made the basis&nbsp; of a&nbsp; decision or award. </p><p>Petitioner&nbsp; also claims&nbsp; that the&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; adopted&nbsp; by the CIR&nbsp; having&nbsp; the&nbsp; charges filed by&nbsp; him&nbsp; against the&nbsp; respondent investigated by&nbsp; its acting&nbsp; prosecutor instead&nbsp; of by the CIR itself, is not sanctioned by the&nbsp; law because&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act No. 875&nbsp; known as the Industrial Peace Act does&nbsp; not require any preliminary investigation;&nbsp; besides, said&nbsp; procedure is disadvantageous&nbsp; to&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; in that it exposed&nbsp; unnecessarily his evidence&nbsp; to the&nbsp; respondent who&nbsp; then knew in advance what said evidence was. We see no objection to the so-called exposure of the evidence of&nbsp; the petition unless he wanted&nbsp; to&nbsp; spring&nbsp; a surprise on&nbsp; the respondents.&nbsp; In&nbsp; civil&nbsp; cases, the plaintiff always presents&nbsp; his&nbsp; evidence first,&nbsp; thereby giving&nbsp; the defendant time&nbsp; and opportunity not only to present its own evidence but to&nbsp; repute that already&nbsp; presented&nbsp; by&nbsp; plaintiff.&nbsp; In criminal&nbsp; cases,&nbsp; the&nbsp; offended&nbsp; party or&nbsp; complainant invariably&nbsp; submits his evidence first, to establish a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case to justify the charges, and&nbsp; in serious offense, preliminary investigation&nbsp; is conducted to establish probable&nbsp; cause&nbsp; before the offender is required to&nbsp; stand trial and to present his own evidence. For&nbsp; better understanding of the procedure provided for by Republic Act No. 875 in unfair labor practice cases, we reproduce section 5(b)&nbsp; of the same:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 5 Unfair Labor Practice.—&nbsp; </p><p>"(<em>b</em>) The&nbsp; Court shall&nbsp; observe the&nbsp; following procedure without resort to mediation&nbsp; and conciliation as provided in&nbsp; section four&nbsp; of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; Numbered One hundred and three, as amended, or to&nbsp; any pre-trial procedure.&nbsp; Whenever it&nbsp; is charged by an of fended party or&nbsp; his representative that any person&nbsp; has engaged or&nbsp; is&nbsp; engaging in&nbsp; any such&nbsp; unfair labor practice, the&nbsp; court&nbsp; or any agency or&nbsp; agent designated by the&nbsp; Court must investigate such charge and shall have&nbsp; the power to issue and cause&nbsp; to be served upon&nbsp; such person a complaint stating&nbsp; the charges&nbsp; in that&nbsp; respect and containing a notice of hearing&nbsp; before the Court or a member thereof, or before&nbsp; a&nbsp; designated Hearing Examiner&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time and place fixed therein not less than five nor more than ten days after&nbsp; serving the said complaint."</p></blockquote><p>From the above quoted legal provision, it is, to us, clear that the Court&nbsp; (CIR) must&nbsp; first investigate the charges filed and that said&nbsp; investigation may&nbsp; be conducted either by the Court itself or&nbsp; a member&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; or any. agent, like the acting&nbsp; prosecutor or a&nbsp; commissioner. Such&nbsp; investigation,&nbsp; is mandatory,&nbsp; because&nbsp; the&nbsp; law&nbsp; uses the word "must". Now,&nbsp; whether or&nbsp; not a&nbsp; regular complaint is to be filed by him depends&nbsp; upon the result of said investigation.&nbsp; It is when&nbsp; a regular complaint based on&nbsp; the said investigation is filed that the CIR intervenes by requiring respondent to answer the complaint and then both parties are heard to receive the evidence to be adduced by them. The investigation is really necessary not&nbsp; only for&nbsp; the protection of the respondent but also for the&nbsp; benefit of the CIR itself so&nbsp; that the&nbsp; respondent may&nbsp; not be&nbsp; required to depend itself against frivolous and unfounded charges, and the valuable time of the CIR dissipated and unnecessarily&nbsp; spent in hearing charges without&nbsp; any basis.</p><p>Interpreting a&nbsp; similar provision of the National Labor Relation Acts, the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals in the Case of National Labor Relations Board vs. Barrett Co.,&nbsp; et al., 120 F. 2nd. 583 referring to the National Labor Relations Board, the counterpart of our CIR, said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *.&nbsp; Its powers and&nbsp; its&nbsp; duties&nbsp; are closely related.&nbsp; Its duty to investigate&nbsp; before it&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; its&nbsp; power to file a complaint seems to us clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, its exercise of power&nbsp; without investigation&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; justifiably questioned&nbsp; and&nbsp; legitimately criticized." "Certainly few would deny the wisdom of such a course. There may be criticisms which arise out of making the investigator, also, the trier&nbsp; of the fact.&nbsp; But that&nbsp; criticism, whatever&nbsp; its&nbsp; merits, is in no way involved in our inquiry, which is to ascertain&nbsp; whether the Act required the Board,&nbsp; as appellants contend, to act,&nbsp; that is, to issue&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; and then&nbsp; investigate the&nbsp; facts—or, as the Government urges, required the Board&nbsp; to investigate the facts set forth in the charge of the employee and issue its complaint only if it finds merit&nbsp; in the charge.&nbsp; In other words, if it appears that reasonable grounds&nbsp; exist for&nbsp; believing the allegation of&nbsp; the employee&nbsp; to be true, and&nbsp; that the employer is engaged in interstate commerce and has been&nbsp; guilty&nbsp; of unfair labor practice condemned by the Act, the&nbsp; Board should&nbsp; act, but not until its investigation established&nbsp; or tended to establish such facts.&nbsp; </p><p>"It would seem&nbsp; highly desirable that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Board's position be upheld, for,&nbsp; if not, the&nbsp; employer would be in the unhappy&nbsp; position of being called&nbsp; upon to defend against false charges preferred by&nbsp; malicious or irresponsible&nbsp; parties. Somewhat comparable to such a situation would be the case of a prosecuting attorney who started&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; proceedings first&nbsp; and investigated&nbsp; afterwards.&nbsp; </p><p>"Specifically the questions are: (1) Does section 10(6) give the power to investigate? and (2) if so, are the powers&nbsp; to investigate and to&nbsp; issue&nbsp; subpoenas&nbsp; therefor, restricted by these&nbsp; sections to cases which have reached the&nbsp; stage&nbsp; where&nbsp; a complaint against the&nbsp; employer has been issued by the&nbsp; Board?.&nbsp; </p><p>"* * *.&nbsp;&nbsp; The power of the Board&nbsp; to&nbsp; issue complaints, to conduct hearings,&nbsp; and to&nbsp; make findings, does not, expressly or&nbsp; impliedly, exclude the investigatory powers.&nbsp; On&nbsp; the other hand, the investigatory powers are complementary to the powers&nbsp; expressly granted to the Board."&nbsp; </p><p>"Section&nbsp; 10&nbsp; (<em>b</em>) does not require the Board to issue a complaint. It expressly provides that the Board&nbsp; "shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; power to issue and cause to&nbsp; be served * * *&nbsp; a complaint&nbsp; stating the charges in that&nbsp; respect "* *.*'&nbsp; "Power to&nbsp; issue" is different from&nbsp; "shall issue."&nbsp; The difference&nbsp; is important.&nbsp; In one the Board's duty is mandatory.&nbsp; It has no&nbsp; discretion. In the other, the Board&nbsp; has a discretion—it acts judicially.&nbsp; It is in the exercise of&nbsp; this&nbsp; discretionary power, that investigation becomes necessary.&nbsp; The&nbsp; power to investigate is a necessary power,&nbsp; which is incidental to the exercise of&nbsp; the power to&nbsp; issue a complaint.&nbsp; It is an implied power, quite as clearly granted as any&nbsp; express power enumerated in said section 10(<em>b</em>.)."</p></blockquote><p>We are,&nbsp; therefore, satisfied&nbsp; that the CIR acted&nbsp; correctly in exercising its investigatory power by designating its&nbsp; acting prosecutor&nbsp; to&nbsp; conduct&nbsp; an investigation of the charges filed by the petitioner, and later having the&nbsp; complaint filed on&nbsp; the&nbsp; basis of&nbsp; the&nbsp; result of said investigation and requiring the respondent to file his&nbsp; answer and then hearing both parties.</p><p>As to&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasons&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of Dacanay, the CIR through&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Bautista,&nbsp; found that he could not have been dismissed for his union activities in the National Union&nbsp; of Printing&nbsp; Workers, for the reason that at the time of his dismissal on August 23, 1953, said union was not yet in existence. On the other hand, the CIR found from the evidence submitted by respondents, Asia Printing and/or its manager, Lu Ming, that Dacanay had been guilty of&nbsp; a series of&nbsp; act&nbsp; of inefficiency, incompetence,&nbsp; lack of interest in his work, disobedience, and as a trouble-maker, ranging from disobeying instructions given to him by the manager of the printing.establishment, to vexing, seriously annoying and quarreling with women employees of the establishment. On several instances, the manager asked Dacanay to place the numbering machine in a can of gas after the mold was finished. This was necessary in order to prevent the&nbsp; machine&nbsp; from becoming rusty.&nbsp; Dacanay never obeyed said instructions saying that, that was for the compositor to do. In other instances, after being given cans of ink&nbsp; to&nbsp; be used in the&nbsp; printing, Dacanay would remove the; labels thereby&nbsp; leaving the ink cans&nbsp; without any&nbsp; identification as to the color and the&nbsp; kind of ink&nbsp; in them,&nbsp; thereby confusing the other employees.&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time, Dacanay quarreled with Isabelo de la Paz, designated by the management&nbsp; to&nbsp; distribute jobs to the workers because Dacanay&nbsp; wanted the position for himself.&nbsp; Then, at another time, Dacanay&nbsp; with&nbsp; a drawn knife about&nbsp; 5 inches long,&nbsp; challenged Roberto&nbsp; Bernardo&nbsp; to&nbsp; fight.&nbsp; Roberto, evidently felt that he&nbsp; could not ignore the&nbsp; challenge, and so he took the big&nbsp; knife used in cutting paper and addressed Dacanay thus:</p><p>"What is in your mind?</p><p>If you like, whatever you like, I am ready."</p><p>Fortunately,&nbsp; the other employees were able to separate them.&nbsp; As to seriously&nbsp; annoying and quarreling with women&nbsp; employees and co-workers,&nbsp; particularly Elena del Rosario, for&nbsp; reasons of decency we refrain from relating the&nbsp; incident; but it is described&nbsp; in the order of Judge, Bautista as related&nbsp; by the woman employee herself, who happened to be married.&nbsp;&nbsp; We reproduce a pertinent portion of the order of Judge Bautista about the charge of inefficiency, incompetence and&nbsp; of being troublesome against Dacanay.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"* * *. As&nbsp; to&nbsp; the imputation&nbsp; of inefficiency&nbsp; and disobedience, Dacanay did&nbsp; not&nbsp; even deny it. He merely stated that, tact Mr. Ming found anything not proper in my behavior,&nbsp; during the last 18&nbsp; and one half years, he would not have given me the wage of P9.80 a day.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp; fact, however, that from&nbsp; 1946 to 1949, the company granted to all its employees increases of&nbsp; wages and consequently&nbsp; Dacanay received them; and the last general increase was given in 1949 by virtue of a decision of the Court of Industrial Relations.&nbsp; </p><p>"With respect to the charge of being troublesome,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the said five altercations, only the case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Roberto Bernardo was&nbsp; denied by&nbsp; Dacanay.&nbsp; The rest remained uncontradicted."</p></blockquote><p>In view of the foregoing, the order of&nbsp; Judge Bautista of&nbsp; December 21,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; dismissing&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; Dacanay's complaint, and&nbsp; the resolution of the CIR<em> en banc</em>&nbsp; dated January 20,&nbsp; 1955, denying&nbsp; Dacanay's motion for&nbsp; reconsideration, are hereby affirmed, with costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
