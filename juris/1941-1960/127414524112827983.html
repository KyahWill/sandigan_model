				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> On February 2, 1953, an information for malicious mischief was filed against 
the accused by the city attorney of Legaspi, Albay, before the Municipal Court 
of Legaspi. He pleaded not guilty. After the prosecution has presented its 
evidence, he moved to quash the information on the ground that the prosecution 
failed to prove all the elements of the crime charged, but the motion was 
denied, thereafter, the accused presented his evidence, after which the court 
rendered a decision finding him guilty of the crime of malicious mischief as 
defined in Article 327 of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced him to suffer ten 
(10) days of <u>arresto</u> <u>menor</u> or pay a fine of P75.00, to indemnify the offended 
party in same amount, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to 
pay the costs.<p></p>
<p>From this decision, he appealed to the court of first instance where again he 
was charged with the same offense. On November 10, 1956, he reiterated his 
motion to quash the information on the same ground that it does not allege the 
necessary elements to constitute the crime of malicious mischief. This time the 
court sustained the motion and dismissed case. The court cancelled the "bond for 
his provisional release. The Government appealed.</p>
<p>The fundamental rule in considering a motion to the ground that the 
averments of the information sufficient to constitute the offense charged is 
whether the facts alleged, if hypothetically admitted, would meet the essential 
elements of the offense as defined in the law. te above ground imports a 
hypothetical admission of the alleged in the information "but challenges their 
sufficiency for failure to meet the essential requisites of the as specified by 
substantive law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> However, it was held that "<u>Prima</u> <u>facie</u>, the 'facts charged' 
are those described in the complaint, but they may be amplified or qualified others 
appearing to be additional circumstances, upon admissions made by the people's 
representative, which admissions could anyway be submitted by him as amendments 
to same information. x x x Of course, it may be added that upon similar 
motions the court and the fiscal are not required to go beyond the averments of 
the information, nor is the latter to be inveigled into a premature and risky 
revelation of his evidence" (People v. Navarro, 75 Phil., 516, 518-519). Does 
the herein information meet this test? </p>
<p>The information filed in the lower court reads :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about January 13, 1953, in the District of Daraga, City of 
Legaspi, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused <u>moved by resentment and anger and with intent to damage 
another's property</u> did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot 
to death a female white pig spotted brown owned by Julian Stabella which act of 
the accused caused damage and prejudice to said Julian Marbella in the amount of 
P75.00 Philippino Currency." (Information, p. 31, Record; Underlining 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>Analyzing the information we find that, as alleged, the accused wilfully 
damaged the property of one Marbella when he shot to death a pig owned by the 
latter with the felonious intent of causing an injury because of resentment and 
anger. In other words, the accused caused damage to the property of another, 
with the intent to cause injury, due to an evil motive, and these are precisely 
the elements instituting the crime of malicious mischief (Article 327, Revised 
Penal Code; see Padilla, Revised Penal Code, Annotated, Vol. II, p. 645, 1955 
ed.)</p>
<p>Commenting on the acts committed by the accused as charged in the information 
and as admitted by the solicitor General, this official said: "Certainly the 
deliberate act the accused Segovia in shooting to death the female white pig 
owned by Julian Marbella was obviously due to malicious intent on his part. As 
it has been established before the Municipal Court the accused shot not only 
once but four times this female white pig with his shotgun, Caliber .22 when he 
saw it among the plants. There was certainly the element of vengeance and anger 
with malicious intent of avenging whatever damage the pig might have done to his 
plants. The proper thing which the accused should have done when he saw the pig 
among his plants, was to drive it away, and after assessing the value of 
whatever damages the pig might have caused to his plants, he should have filed a 
civil action for damages against the owner, in accordance with the provisions of 
the Civil Code. But in this case he took the law in his own hands x x x." We 
agree with this comment. It is obvious that the trial court erred in sustaining 
the motion to quash.</p>
<p>The plea is advanced that the Government can no longer appeal from the 
decision of dismissal without placing the accused in double jeopardy considering 
that he was already convicted by the Municipal Court of Legaspi. This claim 
ignores the fact that he appealed from the judgment of conviction and hence it 
was vacated. The rule is that when an appeal has been perfected, the judgment of 
the justice of the peace or municipal court is vacated and the case is tried <u>de</u> <u>
novo</u> in the court of first instance <u>as if it were originally instituted therein</u> 
(section 8, Rule 119). No new information need be filed in the latter court in 
order that it may acquire jurisdiction to try the case (Crisostomo v. Director 
of Prisons, 41 Phil., 368; People v. Cu Hiok, 62 Phil., 501). If the case, on 
appeal by the accused, is as originally instituted, and the motion was filed 
<u>before arraignment or plea</u>, it is obvious that the dismissal of the case was no 
bar to appeal because it does not place the accused in jeopardy under Section 9, 
Rule 113, of the Rules of Court, The claim is therefore without merit.<br></p>
<p>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby set aside, the case is reiuanded 
to the lower court for hearing on No costs.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" align="center">DISSENTING OPINION<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FELIX</b>, <i>J</i>., </p>
<p>I only need a few words to establish my point and I fully confident of making 
a perfect bull's-eye hit on ruling pronounced on jeopardy in the majority 
decision.</p>
<p>I have no quarrel with my colleagues as to the sufficiency of the information 
in the case at bar. Probably the lower Court was erroneous in dismissing the 
information but I consider that the act of setting aside the order appealed from 
and of remading the case to the lower court for hearing on the merits, is 
absolutely uncalled for and improper, for in so doing we place the defendant in 
double jeopardy. In the majority Decision it is stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On February 2, 1953, an information for malicious mischief against the 
accused was filed by the City Attorney of Legaspi, Albay, before the Municipal 
Court of Legaspi, wherein he pleaded not guilty. After the prosecution <u>had 
presented its evidence</u>, he moved to quash the information on the ground that the 
prosecution failed to prove all the elements of the crime charged, but the 
motion was denied. Thereafter, the accused <u>presented his evidence</u>, after which 
the Court rendered a decision finding him guilty of the crime of malicious 
mischief as defined in Article 327 of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced him 
to suffer ten (10) days of <u>arresto</u> <u>menor</u> or pay a fine of P75.00, to indemnify 
the offended party in the same amount, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>
<p>From this decision he appealed to the Court of First Instance where <u>again he 
was charged with the same offense</u>. On November 10, 1956, he reiterated his 
motion to quash the information on the same ground that it does not allege the 
necessary elements to constitute the crime of malicious mischief. This time the 
court sustained the motion and dismissed the case. The court cancelled the bond 
for his provisional release. The Government appealed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 9 of Rule 113 of the Rules of Court proscribes: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>SEC. 9. FORMER CONVICTION OR ACQUITTAL OR FORMER JEOPARDY.-When a defendant 
shall have been <u>convicted</u> or acquitted, or the case against him dismissed or 
otherwise terminated without the express consent of the defendant, by a court of 
competent jurisdiction, <u>and after the defendant had pleaded to the charge</u>, <u>the 
conviction</u> or acquittal of the defendant or the dismissal of the case <u>shall be a 
bar to another prosecution for the offense charged</u>, or for any attempt to commit 
the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes 
or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or 
information.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case at bar, the defendant pleaded not guilty of the offense in the 
Municipal Court of Legaspi where the formation was filed, and both the 
prosecution and the accused presented evidence which, despite the defenses 
interposed by the latter, caused his conviction and sentence to the penalty 
aforementioned. On appeal, however, and upon motion to quash, the information, 
rightly or wrongly, was dismissed and the defendant exonerated from criminal 
liability. Confronting the provisions of the aforequoted Section 9 of Rule 113 
of the Rules of Court with the acts established and enumerated in the majority 
decision, it cannot be denied that the defendant was prosecuted and convicted of 
the offense charged in a Court of competent jurisdiction and that his conviction 
therein after he had pleaded not guilty to the charge and after evidence was 
submitted the case, constitutes, <u>in the language of the Rules of Court</u>, a bar to 
another prosecution for the same offense though he may have been latter 
acquitted thereof on appeal to the proper Court of First Instance. It is true it 
the defendant appealed from the decision to the lower Court; that, for 
procedural purposes, the decision convicting the defendant of such offense was <u>
vacated</u>; and that the elevation of the case to the Court of First Instance for 
trial <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> was upon the instance and on appeal of the defendant, but all this 
succession of events cannot be any means obliterate nor wipe out facts that have 
already existed and brought to life, a <u>metaphysical</u> impossibility even our 
Creator cannot accomplish, so that once the defendant is acquitted or the case 
dismissed in the upper Court under the circumstances of the case at bar, he is exonerated forever and the prosecution of his case cannot subject to further 
proceedings.</p>
<p>In the case of People vs. Doyle, 54 Phil. 862, this Court held that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This dismissal of a criminal case of estafa which was appealed from a 
Justice of the Peace to the Court of First Instance, the former being vested 
with jurisdiction to try and decide, is equivalent to an acquittal of the 
defendant in said case, <u>and the filing of a new information in which the case 
dismissed is included</u>, exposes said defendant to a second conviction of one and 
the same offense, and therefore constitutes double jeopardy".</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of People vs. Fajardo, 49 Phil. 206, the same principle was 
upheld:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Justice of the Peace having, as he had jurisdiction to entertain the 
complaint for <u>estafa</u> filed in the case, <u>the trial court committed an error of 
law in holding that it had no jurisdiction to try the case on appeal</u>; <u>but its 
judgment</u>, however, in dismissing the case and releasing the accused <u>is 
unappealable for the reason that he was already placed in jeopardy</u>, and 
therefore the motion for dismissal must be granted".</p></blockquote>
<p>That We cannot disregard what has been done in the Municipal Court of Legaspi 
is a matter already repeatedly decided by this Court. We see for example that in 
the case of People vs. Hermino, 64 Phil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Appellant <u>confessed his crime after the prosecution had presented its 
evidence</u>, at least in the Municipal Court where the case originated. <u>It cannot 
he stated that the appeal taken by him to the Court of First Instance again 
restored the case to its original stage for the very reason that the law 
requires a trial DE NOVO, that that there had been no presentation or evidence 
before he confessed or admitted his crime, because a trial DE NOVO gives the 
impression and necessarily implies the existence of a previous trial</u>. The 
confession, in order to constitute a mitigating circumstance, must not only be 
spontaneous but also be made prior to the presentation of the evidence for the 
prosecution (Art. 13, Sec. 7, Revised Penal Code)".</p></blockquote>
<p>The same doctrine was enunciated in the case of People vs. Bawasanta, 64 
Phil. 409, wherein it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Trial de novo means a new trial in the same manner, with the same effect, 
and upon the same issues as the case was tried in the lower Court, in accordance 
with the rules of practice in the appellate court (Sandlin vs. State - 1910 - 3 
Okla. Cr. 578; State vs. Fort - 1909 - 164 Ala. 578; Crisostomo vs. Director of 
Prisons, 41 Phil. 368), <u>and it does not mean that all the proceedings in the 
lower court had thereby bean wiped out so as to preclude the ascertainment of 
whether the defendant voluntarily pleaded guilty in the lower court for the 
purpose of determining the existence of this mitigating 
circumstance</u>".<br><br></p></blockquote><p>See also the cases of People vs. Sy Chay (alias Sy Kuan), 
44Phil. 900 and People vs. De la Peña, 66 Phil. 45l.</p>
<p>Now, if the trial <u>de novo</u> does not wipe out the proceedings in the inferior 
court and the law allows this Court, for purpose of determining the 
circumstances attending the in the court of origin, to go over the record 
thereof, in cases of trials <u>de novo</u> after appeal to the Court of Instance, under 
what principle of justice or even reason and logic are We to disregard in the 
case at bar the fact that the defendant has already been convicted in the 
inferior court? This question is unanswerable and, as stated before, constitutes 
a bull's-eye hit majority decision. Said in Latin, that is "<u>quod erat 
demonstrandum</u>".</p>
<p>WHEREFORE, I firmly and unhesitatingly maintain that remanding of this case 
to the lower court for trial on merits is equivalent or tantamount to placing 
the defendant in double jeopardy. So the present appeal of the government must 
be necessarily dismissed, without pronouncement to costs.</p></div>
