				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> <i>The case</i>.&nbsp; Appellants seek to reverse the order of Hon. Pantaleon Pelayo, Judge of the Iloilo court of first instance refusing to&nbsp; interfere&nbsp; with the&nbsp; alias writ of execution issued in Civil Case No. 2942 pending&nbsp; in another aala of the same court. <br><br><i>The facts</i>.&nbsp; In April 1953&nbsp; Amador Tajanlangit and his wife Angeles,&nbsp; residents of Iloilo, bought from the Southern&nbsp; Motors&nbsp; Inc. of Iloilo two&nbsp; tractors and a thresher.&nbsp; In payment&nbsp; for&nbsp; the same, they executed&nbsp; the promissory note Annex A&nbsp; whereby they undertook to satisfy the total purchase price of P24,755.75 in several installments (with interest) payable on&nbsp; stated dates from&nbsp; May 18,&nbsp; 1953 to December&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp; The note&nbsp; stipulated&nbsp; that&nbsp; if&nbsp; default be made in the payment of interest or of any installment, then the&nbsp; total principal&nbsp; sum&nbsp; still&nbsp; unpaid with&nbsp; interest shall at once become demandable etc.&nbsp; The spouses failed to meet any installment.&nbsp; Wherefore,&nbsp; they were sued, in the&nbsp; above&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 2942, for the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the promissory note.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; The spouses defaulted,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the court, after listening to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Southern Motors' evidence entered judgment for&nbsp; it&nbsp; in the total sum of P24.755.75 together with interest at&nbsp; 12 per cent,&nbsp; plus 10 per cent of the total amount due&nbsp; as attorney's fees&nbsp; and costs&nbsp; of collection. <br><br>Carrying out the order of execution,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sheriff levied on the same machineries and farm implements which had been bought by the spouses; and later sold them at public auction to the highest bidder—which turned out to be the Southern Motors itself—for&nbsp; the total sum of P10,000.<br><br>As&nbsp; its&nbsp; judgment called for&nbsp; much more, the&nbsp; Southern Motors subsequently asked and obtained, an <i>alias</i> writ of execution; and pursuant thereto,&nbsp; the provincial&nbsp; sheriff levied attachment on the Tajanlangits' rights and interests in&nbsp; certain real properties—with a&nbsp; view to another sale on execution.<br><br>To&nbsp; prevent&nbsp; such sale, the Tajanlangits instituted this action in&nbsp; the Iloilo court of first instance for the purpose among others, of annulling&nbsp; the <i>alias</i> writ of execution and all proceedings subsequent thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their&nbsp; two main theories:&nbsp; (1) They had returned the machineries and farm implements to the&nbsp; Southern Motors Inc., the&nbsp; latter accepted them, and had thereby settled their accounts; for that&nbsp; reason, said spouses did&nbsp; not contest&nbsp; the&nbsp; action&nbsp; in Civil Case No. 2942; and (2) as the Southern Motors Inc. had repossessed&nbsp; the machines&nbsp; purchased on installment (and mortgaged)&nbsp; the buyers were thereby relieved from&nbsp; further responsibility,&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of the Recto Law, now article 1484&nbsp; of the&nbsp; New Civil&nbsp; Code. <br><br>For&nbsp; answer, the company denied the alleged "settlement&nbsp; and understanding" during the pendency of civil case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 2942.&nbsp; It also denied&nbsp; having&nbsp; repossessed&nbsp; the machineries,&nbsp; the&nbsp; truth being that they were&nbsp; attached by the sheriff and then deposited&nbsp; by the latter in its shop for safekeeping,&nbsp; before the sale&nbsp; at&nbsp; public auction. <br><br>The case was&nbsp; subrhitted&nbsp; for&nbsp; decision mostly upon&nbsp; a stipulation of&nbsp; facts.&nbsp; Additional testimony&nbsp; was offered together&nbsp; with documentary&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; Everything&nbsp; considered the court&nbsp; entered judgment,&nbsp; saying in part: <br><br><i>"The proceedings&nbsp; in Civil Case No. 2942 above referred to, were had in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; (Branch 1) of the Province and of the City of Iloilo.&nbsp; While this court&nbsp; (Branch&nbsp; IV)&nbsp; sympathizes with plaintiffs, it cannot grant, in this&nbsp; action, the relief prayed for in the&nbsp; complaint because&nbsp; courts of similar jurisdiction cannot invalidate the judgments, and&nbsp; orders of each&nbsp; other. Plaintiffs have not pursued&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; remedy.&nbsp; This court is without authority and jurisdiction to declare null and void the order directing the issuance of alias writ of execution because it was made by another court of equal rank and&nbsp; category&nbsp; (see&nbsp; Cabiao&nbsp; and&nbsp; Izquicrdo&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Del&nbsp; Kosario&nbsp; and Lim, 44&nbsp; Phil., 182-186). <br>&nbsp;<br>Wherefore, judgment&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby rendered dismissing, the&nbsp; complaint with&nbsp; costs against plaintiffs.&nbsp; Let the&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; preliminary injunction issued on&nbsp; August 26, 1954,&nbsp; be lifted."</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; reasonably brought&nbsp; the&nbsp; matter&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Court of Appeals, but the latter forwarded&nbsp; the expediente, being of the opinion&nbsp; that.&nbsp; the appeal&nbsp; involved questions of&nbsp; jurisdiction and/or law. <br><br><i>Discussion</i>.&nbsp; Appellants'&nbsp; brief&nbsp; elaborately&nbsp; explains&nbsp; in the nine&nbsp;&nbsp; errors assigned,&nbsp; their&nbsp; original&nbsp; two&nbsp; theories, although their "settlement" idea appears to be somewhat modified. <br><br>"What is being sought in this present action" say&nbsp; appellants "is&nbsp; to&nbsp; prohibit and&nbsp; forbid&nbsp; the appellee&nbsp; Sheriff of&nbsp; Iloilo from attaching and selling at public&nbsp; auction sale the real properties of appellants because that&nbsp; is&nbsp; now forbidden by&nbsp; our law after the chattels that have been purchased and duly mortgaged to the vendor-mortgagee had already been repossessed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; vendor-mortgagee and later&nbsp; on sold at public&nbsp; auction sale&nbsp; and purchased&nbsp; by the same&nbsp; at such meager&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P10,000." <br><br>"Our law" provides, <br><br>"Art. 148-4. In a contract&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale of personal property the price of&nbsp; which is&nbsp; payable in installments, the vendor may exercise&nbsp; any of&nbsp; the following remedies: <br><br>(1) Exact fulfillment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; obligation, should the&nbsp; vendee&nbsp; fail to&nbsp; pay; <br>(2) Cancel the sale, should&nbsp; the vendee's&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay cover two or&nbsp; more installments; <br>(3) Foreclose&nbsp; the chattel mortgage&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; thing sold,&nbsp; if&nbsp; one has been constituted, should the vendee's failure to pay cover&nbsp; two or&nbsp; more installments.&nbsp; In&nbsp; this case, he&nbsp; shall&nbsp; have&nbsp; no further action against the&nbsp; purchaser to&nbsp; recover any unpaid balance of the price.&nbsp; Any agreement to the contrary shall be void."&nbsp; (New Civil Code.)<br><br>Appellants would invoke the last paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there has&nbsp; been&nbsp; no&nbsp; foreclosure&nbsp; of the&nbsp; chattel&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; nor a&nbsp; foreclosure sale.&nbsp; Therefore the prohibition against further collection&nbsp; does not apply. <br><br><i>"At any rate it is&nbsp; the actual sale of the&nbsp; mortgaged chattel in accordance with section 14 Act No. 1508 that would bar&nbsp; the creditor (who chooses&nbsp; to foreclose)&nbsp; from recovering&nbsp; any&nbsp; unpaid&nbsp; balance. (Pacific Com.&nbsp; Co. vs.&nbsp; Tie la Kama, 72 Phil. 380.)"&nbsp; (Manila&nbsp; Motor Co. vs.&nbsp; Fernandez, 99 Phil., 782.) </i><br><br>It is true&nbsp; that there was a chattel mortgage on the goods&nbsp; sold.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the&nbsp; Southern Motors elected to&nbsp; sue on the- note exclusively, i.e. to exact fulfillment of the obligation to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; had&nbsp; a right&nbsp; to&nbsp; select among&nbsp; the three remedies&nbsp; established&nbsp; in Article 1484.&nbsp; In choosing to sue on the note,&nbsp; it was not&nbsp; thereby&nbsp; limited&nbsp; to&nbsp; the proceeds of the&nbsp; sale,&nbsp; on execution,&nbsp; of the mortgaged good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> <br><br>In Southern Motors Inc. vs. Magbanua,&nbsp; (100 Phil., 155) a&nbsp; similar&nbsp; situation&nbsp; arose in connection with the purchase on installment of a Chevrolet truck by Magbanua.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; latter's default, suit&nbsp; on the note was&nbsp; filed, and the truck levied on together with other properties of the debtor. Contending that the seller was limited to the truck, the debtor&nbsp; obtained a discharge of&nbsp; the other properties.&nbsp;&nbsp; This court said: <br><br><blockquote>"By praying&nbsp; that the defendant&nbsp; be ordered to&nbsp; pay the sum of P4,690 together&nbsp; with the stipulated interest&nbsp; at 12%&nbsp; per annum from&nbsp; 17 March 1954&nbsp; until&nbsp; fully&nbsp; paid, plus&nbsp; 10 per cent of the total&nbsp; amount due&nbsp; as&nbsp; attorney's fees and cost of&nbsp; collection,<i> the plaintiff elected&nbsp; to exact&nbsp; the fulfillment of the&nbsp; obligation and not to foreclose</i> the mortgage on the truck.&nbsp; * * * <br><br>As&nbsp; the plaintiff has&nbsp; chosen to exact&nbsp; the fulfillment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; de- fendant's obligation, the former&nbsp; may&nbsp; enforce&nbsp; execution&nbsp; of the judgment rendered in its&nbsp; favor on the personal and real properties&nbsp; of the latter not&nbsp; exempt from execution sufficient to&nbsp; satisfy the judgment.&nbsp; <i>That part of the judgment</i> depriving the&nbsp; plaintiff of its right to enforce judgment against the properties, of&nbsp; the defend- ant except the mortgaged truck and discharging the writ of at- tachment on his other properties is <i>erroneous</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Italics ours.) </blockquote><br>&nbsp;<br>Concerning their second&nbsp; theory,—settlement or&nbsp; cancel- lation—appellants allege that the&nbsp; very implements sold "were&nbsp; duly returned" by them, and "were duly received and accepted by the&nbsp; said vendor-mortgagee".&nbsp; Therefore, they argue, "upon the return of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same chattels and due acceptance of the same by the&nbsp; vendor-mortgagee, the conditional sale is <i>ipso facto</i> cancelled, with the right of the vendor-mortgagee&nbsp; to&nbsp; appropriate whatever&nbsp; down- payment and posterior monthly installments made&nbsp; by the purchaser as it did happen in the present case at bar." <br><br>The&nbsp; trouble with the argument is that it assumes that acceptance of the goods&nbsp; by the Southern Motors Co.&nbsp; with a view to "cancellation"&nbsp; of&nbsp; the sale.&nbsp; The company denies such acceptance and cancellation, asserting the goods were deposited&nbsp; in&nbsp; its shop when the sheriff attached them&nbsp; in pursuance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the execution.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its assertion is backed up by the sheriff,&nbsp; of whose credibility there is no&nbsp; reason to doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway this cancellation or settlement theory may not be heeded now, because it would contravene the&nbsp; deci- sion in Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 2942&nbsp; above-mentioned—it would show the Tajanlangits owned nothing to Southern Motors Inc.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; decision&nbsp; is&nbsp; binding upon&nbsp;&nbsp; them,&nbsp; unless and until they manage to set it&nbsp; aside in&nbsp; a proper proceeding— and this is not it. <br><br>There are other points involved in the case, such as the authority of the judge of one branch&nbsp; of&nbsp; a court of first1 instance to enjoin proceedings in&nbsp; another branch&nbsp; of the same court.&nbsp; As stated, Judge Pelayo refused to interfere on&nbsp; that ground.&nbsp; Appellants&nbsp; insist this&nbsp; was&nbsp; error on several&nbsp; counts.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; deem it unnecessary to&nbsp; deal&nbsp; with this procedural&nbsp; aspect,&nbsp; inasmuch as we find that,&nbsp; on the merits,&nbsp; plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief demanded.<br><br>Judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; decision dismissing the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; is affirmed, with costs&nbsp; against appellants.&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.
