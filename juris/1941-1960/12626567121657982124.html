				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an action to recover the sum of P165, by&nbsp; way' of&nbsp; separation pay&nbsp; under Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1052.&nbsp;&nbsp; After due trial, the Municipal&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Manila rendered judgment for the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendant,&nbsp; Philippine Education Co., appealed to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of. First Instance&nbsp; of Manila, with the same result.&nbsp; Hence, said defendant has brought the&nbsp; case before Us&nbsp; for review on a question purely of&nbsp; law.<br><br>The&nbsp; case had been submitted, by both parties,&nbsp; for decision upon&nbsp; a stipulation of facts.&nbsp; They&nbsp; agreed:<br><blockquote><ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; That plaintiff&nbsp; employed the defendant as a sales&nbsp; clerk in its store&nbsp; in 1947 and she was continuously in the service until the close of business on August 7, 1954, her salary at that time being P165.00 a&nbsp; month.<br></li><li>&nbsp; That due&nbsp; to&nbsp; absences&nbsp; of several employees in the store of the defendant on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; Catalino de la Cruz, Assistant Manager&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Retail&nbsp; Department,&nbsp; and&nbsp; after&nbsp; him,&nbsp; Harold B. Mannings, Manager of the said&nbsp; department, asked the&nbsp; plaintiff to help in another&nbsp; section of the store which&nbsp; at&nbsp; that time was shorthanded due to several absences; <br></li><li>&nbsp; That the&nbsp; plaintiff claimed&nbsp; that she&nbsp; should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; pushed around and refused to go to the section where&nbsp; she&nbsp; was being assigned temporarily; <br></li><li>&nbsp; That in view of plaintiff's&nbsp; refusal to follow&nbsp; the order of the defendant as&nbsp; above indicated, said defendant thru&nbsp; its paymaster Laureano Fernandez delivered to&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; a&nbsp; memorandum signed by&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; which reads as follows: <br><blockquote>'MEMO TO: <br><br><center>ROSITA A. MAECAIDA </center><br>It is with regret that we notify that your&nbsp; services with&nbsp; this company&nbsp; are terminated as of this date. <br>'This drastic&nbsp; action is of&nbsp; your own making. <br>Many&nbsp; of&nbsp; our people&nbsp; are&nbsp; out&nbsp; sick&nbsp; which of course&nbsp; necessitates close&nbsp; cooperation on the part of all employees. <br>You were&nbsp; asked&nbsp; this morning by&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Catalino de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Cruz to assist in another&nbsp; section.&nbsp; You refused.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp; were again asked by&nbsp; Mr. Manning and&nbsp; you again refused. <br>We&nbsp; cannot permit&nbsp; an employee&nbsp; to defy the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; of the management&nbsp; thereby destroying the factor of control. <br>Your pay will terminate as of&nbsp; 5:30&nbsp; P.M. today and you&nbsp; are&nbsp; free to draw your salary from the pay&nbsp; clerk at your own convenience. <br><br><div style="margin-left: 200px;">(Sgd.)&nbsp; David&nbsp; &amp;. Gunnel <br><i>General&nbsp; Manager'</i></div> </blockquote></li><li>&nbsp; That by&nbsp; virtue of&nbsp; the above&nbsp; memorandum,&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; employment was terminated as of August 7,&nbsp; 1954, that very&nbsp; day she was notified&nbsp; of&nbsp; her separation from the service; "6.&nbsp; That plaintiff was not paid&nbsp; a&nbsp; month's&nbsp; salary in lieu&nbsp; of a month's&nbsp; notice&nbsp; as provided for&nbsp; in&nbsp; Republic Act No. 1052, known as&nbsp; the Termination Pay Law."</li></ol></blockquote>The only issue is whether an employee dismissed, without one-month advance notice, for a just cause imputable to his or&nbsp; her fault,&nbsp; such as&nbsp; insubordination,&nbsp; is&nbsp; entitled to the separation pay provided in Republic Act No. 1052, reading; <br><blockquote>"AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE MANNER&nbsp; OF TERMINATING EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT A DEFINITE PERIOD IN A COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, OR AGRICULTURAL, ESTABLISHMENT OR ENTERPRISE, <br><br>"Section&nbsp; 1. In cases&nbsp; of employment, without a definite period, in a commercial, industrial, or agricultural establishment&nbsp; or enterprise, neither the&nbsp; employer nor the&nbsp; employee shall terminate the employment without serving' notice&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; other at least one month in advance. <br><br>"The employee, upon whom no such notice was served, shall be entitled to one month's compensation from the date&nbsp; of termination of his employment. <br><br>"Sec. 2, Any contract&nbsp; or agreement contrary to&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of section one of this Act shall&nbsp; be null and void. <br><br>"Sec. 3. This Act shall take effect&nbsp; upon its approval." </blockquote>The lower&nbsp; court decided&nbsp; said&nbsp; issue in&nbsp; the affirmative, upon&nbsp; the authority of Dee&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Chuan vs. Nahag et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> G.&nbsp; R. Nos. L-7201 and&nbsp; 7211&nbsp; (September 22, 1954),&nbsp; in which we&nbsp; upheld&nbsp; the right&nbsp; of employees&nbsp; separated from the service, on account of the closing of the&nbsp; employer's business, to&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned separation&nbsp; pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said decision&nbsp; is&nbsp; not controlling,&nbsp; however, in the&nbsp; case at bar, for plaintiff herein was dismissed due to&nbsp; her fault, namely, insubordination,&nbsp; whereas, the&nbsp; employees&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Dee&nbsp; C. Chuan case were separated for a cause&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; their control.&nbsp; It is true&nbsp; that, in disposing of the Dee&nbsp; C. Chuan case,&nbsp; we declared that "whether the&nbsp; cause of&nbsp; the termination of the employment is the&nbsp; closing of business <i>or other justifiable&nbsp; cause</i>, a laborer&nbsp; is&nbsp; entitled to separation pay if the requisite notice is not&nbsp; given him."&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant&nbsp; to the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i>,&nbsp; the phrase "or&nbsp; other justifiable&nbsp; cause''&nbsp; must&nbsp; be construed, however, to&nbsp; refer, not to any justifiable cause, but only to such justifiable causes as&nbsp; are analogous, similar or&nbsp; akin to&nbsp; the&nbsp; "closing of business."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Murphy, Morris &amp; Co. vs. Coll. of Customs, 11&nbsp; Phil., 456; Go Tiaoco y&nbsp; Hermanos&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Union Ins. Society of Canton, 40 Phil., 40;&nbsp; Chartered Bank vs. Imperial &amp; National&nbsp; Bank, 48 Phil., 931; Director of Public <br><br>Works vs. Sing&nbsp; Juco, 53&nbsp; Phil., 205;&nbsp; Co&nbsp; Kim Cham vs. Valdez Tan&nbsp; Peh, 75&nbsp; Phil., 371.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; the employee is&nbsp; not responsible&nbsp; for&nbsp; this&nbsp; cause,&nbsp; it&nbsp; follows that the&nbsp; authority of the&nbsp; Dee&nbsp; C. Chuan case,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a precedent, must&nbsp; be&nbsp; deemed limited to cases&nbsp; in which the employee is separated for causes&nbsp; independent of&nbsp; his will. <br><br>The question&nbsp; varies materially when&nbsp; the separation is due to malfeasance,&nbsp; misfeasance or negligence equivalent thereto.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; for instance, if the&nbsp; employment is terminated on&nbsp; account of embezzlement&nbsp; committed by the employee or&nbsp; serious&nbsp; physical injuries illegally&nbsp;&nbsp; inflicted&nbsp; by him upon the employer,&nbsp; would the latter be bound,&nbsp; either to&nbsp; retain&nbsp; him for&nbsp; another month,&nbsp; with&nbsp; notice&nbsp; that his service would be dispensed with at the end thereof, or to give&nbsp;&nbsp; him&nbsp; one&nbsp; month&nbsp; separation&nbsp; pay ?&nbsp;&nbsp; Common&nbsp; sense readily suggests a negative&nbsp; answer. <br><br>Plaintiff-appellee maintains,&nbsp; however, that said question must&nbsp; be settled&nbsp; in the affirmative in the light of the legislative history of Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1052.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; this connection,&nbsp; it appears that Senate&nbsp; Bill&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 17,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> a&nbsp; with&nbsp; which this&nbsp; legislation&nbsp; was&nbsp; initiated,&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for said advance notice or separation pay when&nbsp; the employment was terminated by the employer "for any just cause not attributable to the fault of the employee concerned."&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; bill further specified&nbsp; the&nbsp; "just causes for dismissing an&nbsp; employee". Subsequently, Senator&nbsp; Primicias,&nbsp; the&nbsp; original author of said, bill, and Senator Ta√±ada, introduced an&nbsp; amendment by&nbsp; substitution&nbsp; the&nbsp; main&nbsp; feature&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; were&nbsp; the amendment of the title, which&nbsp; stated&nbsp; specifically that the measure referred to the termination of services "for causes <i>not attributable&nbsp; to the fault&nbsp; of the employees</i>"; a provision excluding from the operation of the Act those cases in&nbsp; which the employees are&nbsp; granted better or&nbsp; more&nbsp; ad- vantages under&nbsp; other&nbsp; laws;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the elimination&nbsp; of&nbsp; the section enumerating the just causes&nbsp; for&nbsp; dismissal. <br>&nbsp;<br>Still later, Senator Sumulong introduced an amendment to the amendment by&nbsp; substitution,&nbsp; which, eventually,&nbsp; became Republic Act No. 1052.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch as the latter does not require that the&nbsp; separation be "for any just&nbsp; cause&nbsp; not attributable to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fault of&nbsp; the employee" or&nbsp; "through no fault of his own/' plaintiff concludes that the lawmaker intended to give the employee the&nbsp; benefits of the advance notice and&nbsp; separation&nbsp; pay&nbsp; provided in Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1052, regardless&nbsp; of whether or not he is to blame for&nbsp; the termination of&nbsp; his&nbsp; employment. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The&nbsp; force of&nbsp; this argument cannot&nbsp; be denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; How- ever, a careful&nbsp; review of the legislative proceedings relative to said&nbsp; statute&nbsp; fails to reveal&nbsp; anything tangible‚Äî apart&nbsp; from the omission&nbsp; above mentioned‚Äîin support of plaintiff's pretense.&nbsp; On the other hand, several members |of Congress expressly favored the limitation of the benefits y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; question to employees separated without&nbsp; any fault on their part.&nbsp; Thus, Senator&nbsp; Montano said:<br><blockquote>"I think that every senator will agree&nbsp; with me when&nbsp; I&nbsp; say that any employee of this country who is separated from his&nbsp; employment should&nbsp; at least be&nbsp; given&nbsp; a one month compensation, <i>if&nbsp; the separation was not due to any&nbsp; fault&nbsp; of&nbsp; the employee</i> and&nbsp; without any advance notice given&nbsp; to him by the employer.&nbsp; I&nbsp; think on&nbsp; this general&nbsp; principle&nbsp; all&nbsp; the members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Senate can&nbsp; agree." (Italics ours.) (CongressionalRecord for the Senate‚ÄîVol. I, p. 268.)</blockquote> Senator Ta√±ada and Senator&nbsp; Primicias even&nbsp; amended the&nbsp; original bill&nbsp; so&nbsp; that" <i>its very&nbsp; title</i>&nbsp; may&nbsp; specify&nbsp; the limitation&nbsp; above referred&nbsp; to. <br><br>More significant,&nbsp; still, is the&nbsp; fact that none of the members of Congress&nbsp; objected to the aforementioned qualification.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lawmakers&nbsp; indicated&nbsp; their&nbsp; conformity therewith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; introduction‚Äîand&nbsp;&nbsp; adoption‚Äîof the Sumulong Amendment was due exclusively to the need of&nbsp; "making&nbsp; reciprocal&nbsp; the&nbsp; requirement&nbsp; of notice&nbsp; by the employer or&nbsp; by the employee, in case the&nbsp; contract of employment" is&nbsp; not&nbsp; for a definite&nbsp; period.13&nbsp; (Congressional Record for the Senate, Vol. I, pp. 394-395.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Said amendment did&nbsp; not explicitly declare that&nbsp; the&nbsp; separation&nbsp; must be&nbsp; due to causes&nbsp; not attributable to the fault&nbsp; of&nbsp; the employee,&nbsp; because no such requirement appears&nbsp; in&nbsp; Article 302&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Commerce,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup> and Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1052&nbsp; was&nbsp; passed to&nbsp; fill&nbsp; the "void"&nbsp; or&nbsp; "gap"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">4</sup> resulting from&nbsp; the&nbsp; repeal of&nbsp; said&nbsp; provision&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Civil&nbsp; Code of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">5</sup>&nbsp; In&nbsp;&nbsp; the words&nbsp; of Senator Primidas, the bill,&nbsp; which became Republic Act No. 1052,&nbsp; had merely the purpose of&nbsp; "<i>restorin</i>g&nbsp; the&nbsp; sense and spirit of&nbsp; Article 302 of the&nbsp; Code of Commerce," which,&nbsp; although&nbsp; silent on the cause of the termination of the&nbsp; employment,&nbsp; has been repeatedly held to apply&nbsp; only to employees separated <i>without any fault oil&nbsp; their part</i> (Lopez vs.&nbsp; Roces, 73 Phil., 605, 1 Off. Gaz.&nbsp; [October 1942]&nbsp; 672; Sanchez vs. Harry Lyons Construction Inc., 87 Phil.,&nbsp; 532, 48&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 605-607; F. del Puerto&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Gregg&nbsp; Car Co. Inc.,&nbsp; 40&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 12th Supp.&nbsp; [No.&nbsp; 18],&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 103, 105-106).<br><br>The intention&nbsp; of Congress to exclude from&nbsp; the benefits of Republic Act 1052&nbsp; those employees&nbsp; removed&nbsp; for&nbsp; good cause,&nbsp; imputable to&nbsp; them,&nbsp; becomes more manifest when we consider that the original Senate Bill No.&nbsp; 17&nbsp; referred, in its title,&nbsp; to&nbsp; "<i>dismissed employees</i>," and that the term "dismissed" was substituted, in the&nbsp; amendment by substitution, introduced&nbsp; by Senators Primieias&nbsp; and Tanada, by the verb&nbsp; "terminated," which&nbsp; was,&nbsp; also, used&nbsp; in the Sumulong amendment to&nbsp; said&nbsp; amendment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to the word&nbsp;&nbsp; "dismissed",&nbsp; Senator Montano&nbsp; explained&nbsp; that&nbsp; it "gave&nbsp; an idea that the&nbsp; separation&nbsp; of the employee was" <i>due to a&nbsp; "misdemeanor&nbsp; committed&nbsp; by"&nbsp; him</i>&nbsp; whereas <i>the word "separated" is&nbsp; "more descriptive of the intention</i> of the bill under consideration."&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Sumulong, in turn, stressed the "distinction&nbsp; between termination of employment, dismissal for cause&nbsp; and lay-off."&nbsp; He said: <br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; * Those&nbsp; are&nbsp; three <i>different&nbsp; matters</i> which, are&nbsp; treated&nbsp; by our&nbsp; laws differently&nbsp; because&nbsp; they cover <i>different&nbsp; situations</i>&nbsp; In the case of <i>dismissal</i> * * *&nbsp; even if the employment is not yet terminated, even if the employment is in force, the employer&nbsp; can dismiss <i>for just cause</i>.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; But&nbsp; when an&nbsp; employment&nbsp; is&nbsp; <i>terminated</i> you&nbsp; do not&nbsp; need&nbsp; to show cause because&nbsp; that is the agreement of the parties, that upon a certain date the employment will terminate and you do not need&nbsp; to show&nbsp; cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; * * * I believe the provision of section 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; the amendment by substitution covers&nbsp; more&nbsp; precisely the situation of a <i>lay-off</i>, rather than&nbsp; termination&nbsp; of employment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose an employee and an employer enter&nbsp; into a contract for a <i>definite</i> period of one year.&nbsp; But. then when they began&nbsp; the business, somehow <i>circumstances supervened which made it&nbsp; impossible for the employer to produce as much&nbsp; an he&nbsp; was expecting to produce</i>.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; the demand became&nbsp; less, or *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * raw&nbsp; material that he was&nbsp; expecting * * * could not be gotten because&nbsp; he could not get an import control license.&nbsp; So it&nbsp; became necessary for him to reduce personnel&nbsp; because&nbsp; his&nbsp; output&nbsp; became&nbsp; less&nbsp; due to the reduction in&nbsp; demand&nbsp; and in the raw materials coming from&nbsp; the United&nbsp; States to the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; <i>That would&nbsp; be a&nbsp; good&nbsp; case covered&nbsp; by Section 1</i>, because in&nbsp; case of a <i>lay-off</i>, the employer should show&nbsp; that&nbsp; it has been&nbsp; made for a <i>good&nbsp; cause</i> and that&nbsp; <i>the employee was without fault.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the&nbsp; fault of the&nbsp; employee</i> that business lagged,&nbsp; and yet&nbsp; under such a situation our courts by constant jurisprudence&nbsp; has always given the&nbsp; employer&nbsp; the <i>right of lay-off</i> a certain number of personnel in order to be able to&nbsp; continue business.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *."&nbsp; (Cong.&nbsp; Rec. for the&nbsp; Senate,&nbsp; Vol.&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; pp. 322-323; Italics ours.) </blockquote>Thus, Republic Act No. 1052 makes reference to <i>termination</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; employment,&nbsp; instead of&nbsp; <i>dismissal</i>,&nbsp; precisely to exclude employees&nbsp; separated&nbsp; from the services <i>for causes attributable to&nbsp; their own&nbsp; fault.</i> <br><br>Again, Republic&nbsp; Act No.&nbsp; 1052 is limited,&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; operation,&nbsp; to cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; employment <i>without a definite period</i>. When&nbsp; the&nbsp; employment is for&nbsp; a <i>fixed duration</i>,&nbsp; the&nbsp; employer&nbsp; may terminate&nbsp; it, even&nbsp; before the&nbsp; expiration of the&nbsp; stipulated period, should there be&nbsp; a substantial breach of&nbsp; his&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; by the employee (Articles 1169, 3191 and 1198, Civil Code of the Philippines; Pabalan&nbsp; vs. Velez, 22&nbsp; Phil., 29;&nbsp; Gonzales&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Haleerer, 47&nbsp; Phil., 380; Hodges vs.&nbsp; Granada,&nbsp; 59&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 429;&nbsp; De&nbsp; la Cruz vs.&nbsp; Legaspi,&nbsp; 98 Phil., 43, 51 Off.&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 6212), in&nbsp; which&nbsp; event the latter as not entitled to advance notice or separation&nbsp; pay.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would patently, be absurd to grant a right thereto&nbsp; to an employee guilty of the&nbsp; same breach&nbsp; of obligation, when the employment is <i>without&nbsp; a definite period</i>, as if&nbsp; he were entitled to greater&nbsp; protection than&nbsp; employees engaged&nbsp; for a fixed duration. <br><br>Lastly, in the words of the Secretary of&nbsp; Justice:<br><br>"The right to dismiss an employee for cause&nbsp; is&nbsp; inherent in every employer. As&nbsp; announced&nbsp; in&nbsp; tho leading&nbsp; case&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila, Trading . Company&nbsp; vs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zulueta,&nbsp; 40 Off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaz.,&nbsp; 6th&nbsp;&nbsp; Supp.,,&nbsp; .1,&nbsp;&nbsp; 183, Sept. 6, 1341,&nbsp; an&nbsp; employer&nbsp; <i>cannot&nbsp; be legally&nbsp; compelled</i>&nbsp; to continue with the employment of&nbsp; a person&nbsp; guilty of misfeasance&nbsp; or malfeasance towards his&nbsp; employer, and whose continuance in tho&nbsp; service of the latter is&nbsp; patently inimical&nbsp; to&nbsp; his interests.&nbsp; 'The law,&nbsp; in&nbsp; protecting the right of the laborer,&nbsp; authorizes&nbsp; neither oppression nor self-destruction of the employer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; And in line with the above doctrine, it was further held in Philippine! Sheet Metal&nbsp; Workers&nbsp; Union&nbsp; vs. Court of Industrial Relations, G.K. No.&nbsp; L-2028, 46 Off. Gaz., No. 11,&nbsp; p. 5462,&nbsp; <i>that the right to dismiss cannot be denied&nbsp; when it is shown that the laborers are not discharging their duties in a manner consistent with&nbsp; good&nbsp; discipline</i> and&nbsp; the efficient&nbsp; operation of the industrial enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See also:&nbsp; Manila Chauffeur's League&nbsp; vs. Baehrach Motor&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; 40 Oft'.&nbsp; Gaz., 7th Supp.,&nbsp; p. 159; Jacinto&nbsp; vs. Standard Vacuum OiJ Co., 40 Off.

But, when the said Civil Code took effect,&nbsp; no&nbsp; special&nbsp; law was enacted to&nbsp; protect&nbsp; the rights of&nbsp; many&nbsp; workers who, since then, have been dismissed from their employment without the benefit of one month's compensation. <br><br>"<i>To fill the void</i> left by the enforcement of the aforesaid Code, immediate approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; attached&nbsp; bill&nbsp; is, therefore, strongly recommended." <br><br>In his sponsorship speech on said bill, Senator i.lontano declared that it was "intended to <i>fill a gap</i> in our legislation, because of the repeal of that provision of the Code of Commerce"‚Äîreferring&nbsp; to section 302 thereof‚Äî"giving- one month's compensation&nbsp; for laborers&nbsp; who have been separated from their employment."&nbsp; (Congressional Record for the Senate, Vol.&nbsp; I, p. 269.) <br>Senator Primielas,&nbsp; author&nbsp; of&nbsp; said bill, and&nbsp; Senator Sumulong author of the&nbsp; amendment to the&nbsp; amendment by&nbsp; substitution, which because Republic Act&nbsp; No. 1052, confirmed said&nbsp; statement of Senator Montano (Cong', liec. for&nbsp; the Senate, Vol. I,&nbsp; pp. 317 and 318).</blockquote> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">5</sup> Indeed, in Lara vs. Canlas, (94&nbsp; Phil., 778) we held:<br><blockquote>"As to the month pay (mesada)&nbsp; under Art. 302 of the&nbsp; Code of Commerce, Article 2-270&nbsp; of the new Civil Code (Republic Act 386) appears to have repealed said&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 302 when&nbsp; it repealed the provisions of the Code of Commerce&nbsp; governing Agency.&nbsp; This repeal took place on August 30, 1950, when the&nbsp; new Civil Code went into effect, that is one year after its&nbsp; publication&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Official Gazette."</blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> In his opinion&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 33, dated .
