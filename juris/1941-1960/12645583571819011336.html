				G.R. No. L-2120, March 09, 1949</h4>
				<H3>JOSE ALVAREZ ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. FIDEL IBAÑEZ, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LAGUNA AND COLEGIO DE SAN JOSE, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PERFECTO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners pray that the Court of First Instance of Laguna be declared 
without jurisdiction to take cognizance of civil case No. 9039, entitled 
"Colegio de San Jose <i>versus</i> Jose H. Guevara, et al.," and that the orders 
issued in said case on December 10, 1947, January 22, 1948 and February 13, 
1948, be set aside.
<p>The complaint in said case was filed on December 10, 1947, and on said date 
the lower court appointed Segundo C. Mastrili as receiver.</p>
<p>According to petitioners, said receiver, with the assistance of MP soldiers, 
compelled petitioners to deliver to him their crops of palay, and that 
petitioners filed on December 22, 1947, an urgent petition asking for the 
reconsideration of the appointment of the receiver, but that said motion has 
never been acted upon. On Janaary 21, 1948, petitioners filed a petition seeking 
resolution of their motion, but the lower court failed to resolve said 
motion.</p>
<p>It is also alleged that on December 31, 1947, petitioners moved for the 
dismissal of the complaint but their motion was denied on January 22, 1948. Then 
they moved for the reconsideration of this order of denial, but their motion for 
reconsideration was also denied on February 13, 1948;</p>
<p>Petitioners contend that the order of December 10, 1947, appointing Segundo 
C. Mastrili as receiver, and the orders of denial of January 22 and February 13, 
1948 are illegal and null and void for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Because the order appointing the receiver was issued without 
complying with the requirements of the law, and in a complaint where no specific 
land, improvements, or crops of palay are litigated, much less concerning the 
crops of palay in the lands occupied by petitioners as owners, and that said 
complaint has the effect of depriving petitioners of the possession of said 
lands.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The lower court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter 
because the money claimed in the complaint is covered by the law on moratorium; 
the judgment in civil case No. 6663 intended to be revived, has prescribed; 
there is no jurisdictional or positive allegation in the complaint to the effect 
that petitioners are responsible for the payment of said judgment; the whole 
judgment in said case was transferred by the Colegio de San Jose to the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines on September 27, 1939; the Colegio de San Jose 
who appears as plaintiff is non-existing having been abolished by the decree of 
expulsion of Jesuits in 1767; and petitioners were not parties in the civil case 
No. 6663.</p>
<p>Petitioners further allege that the receiver has deprived petitioners of 
their properties to the extent of reducing them to complete destitution and 
misery.</p>
<p>Respondents answered that the lower court has jurisdiction over the subject 
matter controverted in civil case No. 9039; that petitioners are either parties, 
privies or successors in interest, agents or representatives, tenants or 
<i>aparceros</i> of the parties-plaintiff in civil case No. 6663 whose judgment 
is intended to be revived; and that the petition for receivership falls under 
the cases enumerated in Sectional, of Rule 61, Rules of Court, because 
petitioners are insolvent and have refused for several years to have the produce 
of the land in question applied to the satisfaction of the judgment sought to be 
revived, and that the appointment of the receiver is authorized by Section 3 of 
said Rule 61.</p>
<p>Respondents allege also that the ownership of the Colegio de San Jose over 
the property in question is recognized by contracts, ratified by law and 
confirmed by courts of justice; that the rights and choses of action over the 
judgment sought to be enforced were never sold or transferred to the Government; 
that the right to enforce said judgment is not covered by the moratorium and has 
not prescribed; that the lower court did not act with grave abuse of discretion 
in not resolving petitioners petition for reconsideration of the order 
appointing a receiver because a petition for prohibition with preliminary 
injunction, involving the same issues raised in the petition, was presented 
before the Supreme Court on December 24, 1947, on behalf of the other defendants 
in civil case No. 9039, and the respondent judge had no other alternative than 
to issue the order dated January 9, 1948, suspending any action on the aforesaid 
petition for reconsideration until the Supreme Court shall have decided said 
petition for prohibition.</p>
<p>The issues in the present case are substantially the same as those in the 
case of Ramirez vs. Ibañez, (83 Phil., 97), wherein it was decided by majority 
decision to dismiss the case on the ground that the lower court should first be 
given the chance of deciding the issues pending therein, before petitioners 
could be allowed to seek remedy from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In the present case, the lower court did not act upon petitioners' motion for 
reconsideration of the order appointing Segundo C. Mastrili as receiver because 
of the filing of the petition for prohibition in said case (Ramirez vs. Ibañez, 
<i>supra</i>). The lower court should be given the chance of deciding said 
question before petitioners can appear before us to raise the same question.</p>
<p>As regards the orders of the lower court of January 22 and February 13, 1948, 
because of which petitioners failed to secure the dismissal of the complaint in 
civil case No. 9039, the proper remedy for petitioners is by ordinary appeal in 
due time.</p>
<p>Petition dismissed. With the dismissal of the petition it is not necessary to 
make any pronouncement on the incidental matters raised by petitioners.</p>
<p>The foregoing is the decision of the majority, from which the writer 
dissents.</p>
<p>The writer, consistent with his dissent in L-1878,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> is of opinion that, pending the decision 
on the merits of civil case No. 9039, the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained 
to the effect that petitioners' possession of the lands they hold be respected 
and that they be not deprived of their crops of palay because receivership does 
not have the purpose of disturbing a legal status quo, but rather to preserve 
it.</p>
<p><i>Moran, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.</i>, 
concur.<br><i>Paras, J.</i>, concurs in the result.</p>
<p>FERIA, J.:</p>
<p>I concur in the dismissal of the petition.</p>
