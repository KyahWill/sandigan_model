				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On October 22, 1954, Yu Hai alias "Haya" was accused in the Justice of the Peace Court of Caloocan of a violation of Article 195, sub-paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, for having allegedly permitted the game of <span style="font-style: italic;">panchong or paikiu</span>, a game of&nbsp; hazard,&nbsp; and having acted as maintainer thereof, in the municipality of Caloocan on or about the 26th day of June,&nbsp; 1954.&nbsp; The accused moved to quash the information&nbsp; on the ground that it charged more than one&nbsp; offense and that the&nbsp; criminal action&nbsp; or liability therefor had already been extinguished; and the Justice of the Peace Court, in its order&nbsp; of December&nbsp; 24, 1954, sustained the motion to quash&nbsp; on the theory that the&nbsp; offense&nbsp; charged was a&nbsp; light&nbsp; offense which,&nbsp; under Article 90 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code, prescribed in&nbsp; two months.<p>The provincial fiscal&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; to the Court of First Instance of the province, which&nbsp; affirmed the order of dissmissal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; information.&nbsp; Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; provincial fiscal appealed directly to this&nbsp; Court.</p><p>The sole issue is the period for the prescription of the offense charged,&nbsp; punishable under Article&nbsp; 195 of&nbsp; the Revised Penal Code by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> or a fine not exceeding P200.&nbsp; The lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; held that&nbsp; the crime charged&nbsp; is a light offense as&nbsp; defined in Article&nbsp; 9 of the&nbsp; Code, and prescribed&nbsp; in two&nbsp; months;&nbsp; while&nbsp; the Solicitor&nbsp; General argues that as the&nbsp; crime charged may be punished&nbsp; by a maximum fine of P200 (a correctional penalty&nbsp; under Article 26), the same prescribe,&nbsp; also under Article 90,&nbsp; in ten years.</p><p>The&nbsp; pertinent legal provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Revised Penal</p><p>Code are:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Art, 90. <em>Prescription&nbsp; of crimes.</em>—</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><blockquote>&nbsp;Those punishable by&nbsp; a correctional penalty&nbsp; shall&nbsp; prescribe&nbsp; in ten&nbsp; years; with the exception of those punishable&nbsp; by&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>, which shall prescribe in&nbsp; five&nbsp; years.&nbsp; <p>The crime of libel or other&nbsp; similar offenses prescribe in two years. The&nbsp; offenses&nbsp; of oral&nbsp; defamation&nbsp; and&nbsp; slander&nbsp; by&nbsp; deed&nbsp; shall prescribe&nbsp; in&nbsp; six months.</p><p>Light offenses prescribe in two months.</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><blockquote><p>'Art. 9.<em> Grave felonies, less grave felonies, and light felonies</em>.—</p></blockquote><p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p><blockquote><p>Less grave&nbsp; felonies&nbsp; are&nbsp; those which the&nbsp; law&nbsp; punishes with penalties which in their&nbsp; maximum&nbsp; period&nbsp; are correctional,&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with the&nbsp; above&nbsp; mentioned article.</p><p>Light felonies are&nbsp; those infractions of law for&nbsp; the commission of&nbsp; which&nbsp; the&nbsp; penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> or&nbsp; a&nbsp; fine not&nbsp; exceeding 200 pesos or both, is&nbsp; provided."</p><p>"Art. 26.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Fine,&nbsp; when&nbsp; afflictive, correctional,&nbsp; or&nbsp; light</span>.—A&nbsp; fine, whether imposed as a single&nbsp; or as an alternative penalty, shall&nbsp; be considered an afflictive&nbsp; penalty,&nbsp; if&nbsp; it exceeds 6,000 pesos;&nbsp; a correctional&nbsp; penalty,&nbsp; if&nbsp; it&nbsp; does not exceed 6,000&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; but is&nbsp; not less than&nbsp; 200 pesos; and a&nbsp; light penalty&nbsp; if it&nbsp; be less&nbsp; than&nbsp; 200 pesos."</p></blockquote><p>Under Article 90, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra,</span> "light offenses&nbsp; prescribe&nbsp; in two&nbsp; months".&nbsp; The definition&nbsp; of "light&nbsp; offenses"&nbsp; is&nbsp; in turn to be&nbsp; found&nbsp; in Article&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; which classifies&nbsp; felonies into&nbsp; grave,&nbsp; less grave, and&nbsp; light, and defines "light felonies" as "those infractions of&nbsp; law&nbsp; for&nbsp; the commission of which the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> or a fine not exceeding 200 pesos&nbsp; or both is&nbsp; provided"'.&nbsp; The offense charged&nbsp; is&nbsp; punishable&nbsp; by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto&nbsp; menor </span>or&nbsp; a fine&nbsp; not exceeding 200&nbsp; pesos (Article&nbsp; 195).&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; it is a "light offense"&nbsp; under Article 9&nbsp; and prescribes&nbsp; in&nbsp; two months under Article 90.</p><p>The Solicitor General argues that as the crime charged may be punished by a maximum fine of P200, which under Article 26&nbsp; is&nbsp; a correctional&nbsp; penalty, the time for prescription&nbsp; thereof is ten&nbsp; years,&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to&nbsp; paragraph 3 of Article 90.&nbsp; This argument is untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place,&nbsp; while Article 90 provides that light&nbsp; offenses prescribe in two months,&nbsp; it does not define what is meant by "light offenses",&nbsp; leaving it to Article 9 to fix its meaning. Article 26,&nbsp; on the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; has&nbsp; nothing to do&nbsp; with the definition of offenses, but merely classifies fine, when imposed as a&nbsp; principal&nbsp; penalty, whether&nbsp; singly&nbsp; or&nbsp; in the alternative into the categories of afflictive, correctional, and light penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the question at&nbsp; issue is the prescription of a crime and not the prescription of a penalty, Article 9 should&nbsp; prevail over Article 26.</p><p>In the second place,&nbsp; Article 90 could not have intended that&nbsp; light&nbsp; offenses as defined&nbsp; by&nbsp; Article 9 would&nbsp; have two&nbsp; prescriptive periods—two&nbsp; months if&nbsp; they are penalized by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto&nbsp; menor</span> and/or a fine of&nbsp; less than P200, and&nbsp; ten years if penalized&nbsp; by a maximum&nbsp; fine of P200. Under the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Solicitor General, the difference of only one peso in the imposable fine would mean all the difference&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; nine years&nbsp; and&nbsp; ten&nbsp; months&nbsp; in&nbsp; the prescriptive period&nbsp; of the offense.&nbsp; And what&nbsp; is worse, the proper prescriptive period could not be ascertained until and unless the court decided which of the alternative penalties should be imposed; which the court could not properly do&nbsp; if&nbsp; the&nbsp; offense had prescribed, for&nbsp; then it&nbsp; could no longer be prosecuted.&nbsp;&nbsp; These absurd results the law-makers could not have wittingly intended, especially since more serious offenses as&nbsp; those punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> (a correctional penalty)&nbsp; prescribe, also&nbsp; under Article 90, in five years, while other "less grave" offenses like libel, and oral defamation and slander, prescribe in even shorter periods of time, two years and six&nbsp; months respectively. As held in the case of People <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Florendo, 73 Phil. 679, there is no reason to suppose that the law-maker would raise the prescriptive period for certain&nbsp; light&nbsp; offenses over other light offenses.</p><p>It should also&nbsp; be noted that under Article 9, a light felony is one punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto&nbsp; menor</span> of a&nbsp; fine not exceeding 200 pesos&nbsp; or both.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; if we are to follow the&nbsp; argument of&nbsp; the Solicitor General that Article 26 should prevail over Article 9 if the&nbsp; offense is punishable by&nbsp; a maximum fine&nbsp; of&nbsp; P200, we would again&nbsp; have the absurd situation&nbsp; that an&nbsp; offense penalized&nbsp; by&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> or fine not exceeding P200 in the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> alternative</span>, would be a less grave felony, while&nbsp; the more serious one, which the law penalizes with both imprisonment of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto menor</span> and a fine&nbsp; not&nbsp; exceeding P200,&nbsp; remains&nbsp; only&nbsp; a&nbsp; "light offense".</p><p>Finally,&nbsp; criminal statutes are to. be&nbsp; strictly construed against the&nbsp; government and liberally&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused.&nbsp; As it would be more favorable to the herein accused to apply the&nbsp; definition of "light felonies"&nbsp; under Article 9 in connection with the prescriptive period of the offense charged, the same should&nbsp; be followed.&nbsp; Under Article 90, the offense charged, being a&nbsp; light offense,&nbsp; prescribed in two months.&nbsp; As it was allegedly committed on June 26, 1954 and the information filed only&nbsp; on October 22, 1954, the lower court correctly ruled that the crime in question has already prescribed.</p><p>The decision appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed, with costs <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio.</span>&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
