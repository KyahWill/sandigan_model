				[ G. R. No. 313, December 20, 1946</h4>
				<H3>CIRIACO IBAÃ‘EZ, PETITIONER, VS. HERNANDO HERNANDEZ, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LEYTE, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The petitioner was prosecuted in seventeen (17) cases for violation of 
article 213 of the Revised Penal Code, and in four (4) cases for 
misappropriation of public funds defined and penalized in article 217 of the 
same Code.</p>
<p>The Court of First Instance of Leyte, in its sentence dated May 22, 1941, 
found the petitioner guilty in the said seventeen cases for violation of article 
213 of the Penal Code, and four (4) cases for misappropriation of public funds 
(all of which were tried jointly by agreement of the parties); but convicted him 
only in three of the aforementioned seventeen cases and in three of the four 
cases' for misappropriation of public funds, in accordance with article 70 of 
the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p>Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, and the latter affirmed with 
modification the sentence of the lower court. No appeal by ceritiorari having 
been taken by the petitioner to this Court, the decision of the Court of Appeals 
became final after fifteen (15) days from its promulgation, and after the entry 
of the judgment the case was remanded to the lower court with a certified copy 
of the judgment or sentence for execution, in accordance with sections 8 and 9 
of Rule 53, made applicable to criminal cases by section 17, of Rule 120.</p>
<p>The judgment of the Court of First Instance as affirmed by the Court of 
Appeals could not be executed, because the defendant had been hiding in the 
mountains of Leyte according to what the petitioner alleges in his petition.</p>
<p>On June 8, 1915, petitioner filed with the Court of Firsl Instance of Leyte a 
motion asking the court "to suspend the reading of the decision of the Court of 
Appeals" on the ground that "all acts of said Court of Appeals, being a creation 
of the Japanese-sponsored government, are null and void; and that the said Court 
of First Instance has no jurisdiction to have the aforesaid decision read to the 
accused in view of the fact that a Court of Appeals duly constituted in 
accordance with the Constitution of the Philippines and the laws of the 
Commonwealth, has not yet passed upon the merits of the case on appeal to said 
court." The provincial fiscal of Leyte filed a well prepared opposition to said 
motion, and the Court of First Instance of Leyte denied the motion on the 
strength of the doctrine laid down by this Court in the case of Co Kim Cham vs. 
Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, (75 Phil., 113).</p>
<p>This case is before this Court by virtue of petition for certiorari, as 
special civil action, filed by the petitioner under section 1, Rule 67.</p>
<p>The grounds for the petition called "motivos de accion" by the petitioner, 
are (1) that the petitioner has not been able to attend to his said cases 
appealed to the Court of Appeals, nor to file a motion for a new trial and to 
appeal by <em>certiorari</em> to this Court from the Court of Appeals' decision, 
because he had' been hiding in the mountains in onler to preserve his loyalty to 
the Commonwealth and avoid serving the invader; (2) that the Japanese government 
had tried to arrest him and made him serve the said sentence; (3) that the 
latter was set aside by the judicial authorities of Leyte by virtue of the 
amnesty granted by the President of the so-called Republic of the Philippines; 
(4) that the cases against him, having been decided by the Court of Appeals 
under the Japanese government, had acquired international character and required 
the application of the International Law; (5) that three of the seventeen cases, 
and three of the four cases above mentioned refer to the same subject matter, 
and therefore he was charged with several offenses based on one and the same 
act, contrary to a circular of the Attorney General issued to provincial fiscals 
on October, 1941; and (6) that the respondents have issued orders and taken 
steps to have the decision of the Court of Appeals executed, in excess of their 
powers and jurisdiction.</p>
<p>All the so-called "causes of action" or grounds in support of the petition 
are without merit and deserve no serious consideration.</p>
<p>In the case of Co Kim Cham vs. Yaldez Tan Keh and Dizon, <em>supra</em>, as 
well as in that of Alcantara vs. Director nf Prisons (75 Phil., 491). this Court 
has laid down the doctrine that the judgments and sentences, not of political 
complexion, of the ordinary courts in these Islands. during the Japanese 
occupation are good and valid. Therefore the respondent Judge did' not act 
without or in excess of its-jurisdiction in ordering the petitioner to appear in 
order to serve the sentence complained of which is not of political complexion. 
</p>
<p>The fact that after submitting, without objection his appeal to the Court of 
Appeals, the petitioner had -absconded himself in the..mountains to avoid 
serving the sentence rather than for the reasons stated or alleged in his 
petition, and for that reason he was prevented, according to his allegation, 
from filing a motion for new trial, or an appeal "by <em>certiorari</em> to this 
Court, did not affect the validity of the said sentence.</p>
<p>Messrs. Justices Hilado and Pcrfccto quote, as a new ground for their 
dissent, an excerpt of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in 
the case of Jones vs. United States (137 U. S., 202), which says that the 
question "who is the sovereign, <em>de jure or de facto</em>, of a territory is 
not a judicial, but a political, question, the determination of which by the 
legislative and executive departments of any government conclusively binds the 
judges, as well as all other officers, citizens and subjects, of that 
government." The only conclusion that may be drawn from the said quotation by 
the dissenters is, that they propounded the new theory that the question whether 
a government is <em>de facto</em> or <em>de jure</em> involves necessarily that 
of sovereignty, which, being a political question, is to be determined by the 
legislative and executive departments of a government, and not by the courts of 
justice. This theory is clearly erroneous. It is true that a government 
established in a territory under a sovereign <em>de jure</em> is a government 
<em>de jure</em>, but it is not true that a government established in a 
territory under a sovereign <em>de jure</em> can not be a government <em>de 
facto</em>. The three classes of government <em>de facto</em> set forth in the 
decision of this Court in the case of Co Kim Cham vs. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon 
and recognized by all the publicists and decisions of the Supreme Court of the 
United States, are governments <em>de facto</em> in a territory under the same 
sovereign<em> de jure</em>, or in which no question is involved as to change of 
sovereignty. In the said case of Co Kim Cham vs. Valdez-Tan Keh and Dizon, this 
Court said: "There are several kinds of <em>de facto</em> governments. The 
first, or government <em>de facto</em> in a proper legal sense, is that 
government that gets possession and control of, or usurps, by force or by the 
voice of the majority, the rightful legal government and maintains itself 
against the will of the latter, such, as the government of England under the 
Commonwealth, first by Parliament and later by Cromwell as Protector. The second 
is that which is established and maintained by military forces who invade and 
occupy a territory of the enemy in the course of war, and which is denominated a 
government of'paramount force, as the cases of Castine, in Maine, which was 
reduced to British possession in the war of 1812, and of Tampico, Mexico by the 
troops of", the United States. And the third is that established as an 
independent government by the inhabitants of. a country who rise in insurrection 
against the parent state, such,as the. government of the Southern Confederacy in 
revolt against the Union during the war of secession."</p>
<p>Were the theory advanced in the dissenting opinion correct the decisions of 
the Supreme Court of the United States in the following cases in which it held 
that the governments in a territory temporarily occupied by the invading enemy 
forces during war, or set up by the insurgents during insurrection or rebellion, 
were <em>de facto</em> governments, would be also necessarily erroneous, and we 
do not think the dissenting Messrs. Justices Hilado and Perfecto mean to so 
hold. The Supreme Court of the United States hold in the case of United States 
vs. Rice (4 Wheaton, 258), that the government established in Castine, Maine, 
occupied temporarily by the British forces in the war of 1812 was a <em>de 
facto</em> government. The same Court held in the case of Fleming vs. Page (0 
How., 614), that the government established by the American forces in Tampico, 
Mexico, during the war between the latter and United States was a <em>de 
facto</em> government. In the cases of Thorington vs. Smith (8 Wall. 1), 
Williams vs. Bruffy (95 U. S., 176) (quoting the decision in the case of Horn 
vs. Lockhart, 17 Wall., 570), and Bairly vs. Hunter (171 U. S., 888), it was 
held that the governments set up by the Confederate States during the war of 
secession were dc facto governments. And, in the case of McCleod vs. United 
States (229 U. S., -116), the same Supreme Court of the United States held that 
the short-lived government established by Filipino insurgents in the island of 
Cebu during the Spanish-American War, was a dc facto government.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that there are only five Justices concurring in this 
opinion, and after a rehearing the voting remained the same, the petition for 
certiorari is dismissed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 56 section 2, 
in relation with Rule 58, section 1, of the Rules of Court. So 
ordered.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Paras, Pablo,</em> and <em>Bengzon, JJ.,</em> 
concur. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>HILADO, J.,</strong> with whom concurs<strong> PERFECTO, 
J.:</strong></p>
<p>We dissent.</p>
<p>In this case the result of the voting failed to obtain a majority. In 
accordance with the provisions of Rule 56, section 2 in relation with Rule 58, 
section 1, this case was set for rehearing, but no party appeared when it was 
called on the day set. Thereafter, the respective opinions of the Justices and 
the voting remained the same, with the consequences that, pursuant to said 
section 2, this action, which was originally commenced in this Court, will be 
dismissed. With all due respect to our brethren who maintain different views 
from ours upon the very vital legal questions involved herein, we feel 
constrained to dissent from said determination of the case. The opinion of our 
said brethren has been written by Mr. Justice Feria in the form of the foregoing 
decision. Said opinion is predicated upon the doctrine, from which we also 
dissented, laid down in Co Kim Cham vs. Valdez Tan-Ken- and Dizon (75 Phil., 
113).</p>
<p>In order that the majority decision, with the dissents, in this case may be 
promulgated without further delay, we have decided to merely summarize the 
reasons supporting ours, without prejudice to our registering a more extended 
dissent in Etorma vs. Ravelo and Director of Prisons (78 Phil., l45). Briefly, 
this dissent is 'based upon: (1) the reasons set forth-in my dissent, both from 
the main decision and from the resolution on the motion for reconsideration, in 
Co Kim Cham vs. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon, <em>supra</em>: (2) those set. forth 
in my concurring opinion in Peralta rs. Director of Prisons (75 Phil., 285) ; 
(3) those set forth in my concurring opinion in People vs. Jose (75 Phil., 612) 
; (4) those sot forth in my dissent in Alcantara vs. Director of Prisons (75 
Phil., 494) ; (5) those set forth in my dissenting opinion in Castro vs. Court 
of Appeals (75 Phil., 824) ; and (6) the doctrine in Jones vs. United States 
(137 U. S., 202; 34 Law. ed., 691, 696), and in the cases therein cited, 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who is the sovereign, <em>de jure</em> or <em>de facto</em>, of a territory 
is not a judicial, but a political, question, the determination of which by the 
legislative and executive departments of any government conclusively binds the 
judges, as well as all other officers, citizens and subjects, of that 
government. This principle has always been upheld by this court, and lias been 
affirmed under a great variety of circumstances. (Gelston vs. Hoyt, 16 U. S., 3 
Wheat., 246, 324 [4:381, 401]; United States es. Palmer, Id., 610 [471]; The 
Divina Pastora, 17 U. S., Wheat., 52 [4:512]; Foster vs. Neilson, 27 U. S., 2 
Pet., 253, 307, 309 [7:415, 433, 434]; Keene us. M'Donough, 33 U. S., 8 Pet, 308 
(8:955); Garcia vs. Lee, 37 U. S., 12 Pet., 511, 520 (9:1176); Williams vs. 
Suffolk Ins. Co., 38 U. S-, 13 Pet., 415 [10:226]; United States vs. Yorba, G8 
U. S-, 1 Wall., 412, 423 [17:635, G37]; United States vit. Lynde, 78 U. S., 11 
Wall., C32, 638 [20:230, 232]. It is equally well settled in England. The 
Pelican, Edw. Adm. Appx. D; Taylor vs. Barclay, 2 Sim., 213; Emperor of Austria 
vs. Day, 3 De G. F. &amp; J., 217, 221, 233; Republic of Peru vs. Peruvian Guano 
Co., L. R., 36 Ch. Div. 489, 497; Republic of Peru vs. Dreyfus, L. R., 38 Ch. 
Div., 348, 356, 359."; (137 U. S., 202, 213; 34 Law.-ed., 
696.)</p></blockquote>In the case of Etorma vs. Ravelo and Director of Prisons, 
<em>supra</em>, we propose to show the pertinence and applicability of the 
doctrine in Jones vs. United States, <em>supra</em>, and make an'extended 
discussion of the other grounds of<br>our dissent therein. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISIDENTE</em></p>
<p><strong>BRIONES, M.:</strong></p>
<p>Disiento de la poncncia por las mismas razones expnestas en nii'disidenda 
registrada en el asunlo de Co Rim Cham contra Yaldez Tan Ken and Dizon (75 
Phil., 371).</p>
<p>Es un hecho no impugnado seriamente que el recurrcnte se replego en las 
montanas de Leyte para huir del gobierno de fuerza predominante o <em>de 
facto</em> establecido por los japoneses en estas Islas durante la ultima 
guerra. El tenia derecho de hacerlo; no estaba obligado a rendir vasallaje a 
dicho gobierno. Cuando seremonto todavia le quedaban ciertos recursos para 
defenderse; y si no pudo utilizarlos fue por dicho remontamiento.</p>
<p>Por tanto, ahora, en la liberacion, es nada mas que justo el que se le de la 
oportunidad de <br>agotar tales recursos, permitiendole proseguir su 
apelacion.</p>
<p>El recurso debe estimarse.</p>
