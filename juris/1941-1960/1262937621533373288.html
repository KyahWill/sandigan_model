				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> This appeal involves a question of priority between creditors that the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila resolved in favor of the&nbsp; appellee&nbsp; Alto Surety and Insurance Co., Inc.<br><br>It appears&nbsp; that&nbsp; on&nbsp; April&nbsp; 21,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; one Primitivo&nbsp; P. Ferrer executed in&nbsp; favor of La&nbsp; Tondeña, Inc.,&nbsp; a&nbsp; second chattel mortgage upon certain properties&nbsp; described in the complaint,&nbsp; to&nbsp; guarantee&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; certain&nbsp;&nbsp; amounts. Some of these properties&nbsp; were already subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; a first mortgage in favor&nbsp; of one&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Ruiz.&nbsp;&nbsp; All&nbsp; mortgages were duly&nbsp; registered.<br><br>On August 18, 1949, Pedro Ruiz sought foreclosure of the first mortgage&nbsp; in his favor, alleging default by&nbsp; the mortgagor Ferrer;&nbsp; and in view of the latter's refusal to surrender the&nbsp; properties mortgaged,&nbsp; Ruiz started&nbsp; action&nbsp; in court (Case No. 10880 of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Pangasinan) and asked for their replevin.&nbsp; However, Ferrer secured&nbsp; their release by means of a redelivery bond for P20,000, guaranteed&nbsp; by the Alto Surety and Insurance Co. The case having been tried, the court rendered&nbsp; judgment on&nbsp; December&nbsp; 1, 1950, sentencing&nbsp; Ferrer to pay&nbsp; Ruiz (P6,590.00 plus interest and attorneys' fees. As Ferrer defaulted, the Alto Surety paid for him on June 19, 1952.<br><br>While this first case was still pending, La Tondeña, Inc. instituted court proceedings&nbsp; against Ferrer on November 15,&nbsp; 1949&nbsp; (No.&nbsp; 9658&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Manila&nbsp; to&nbsp; foreclose its&nbsp; second&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; and to recover various other suras; and on June 7, 1950, judgment&nbsp; was rendered sentencing Ferrer to pay P7,122.49 plus interest and costs on account of the mortgage debt, with a decree for its foreclosure if not paid within ninety days.&nbsp; Ferrer was also sentenced to pay P6,608.00 on the other cause of action. In view of the foreclosure decree the Provincial Sheriff of Pangasinan levied on the mortgaged properties and advertised them for sale.&nbsp; The sale was postponed from time to time, until on December 13, 1950, upon request of Ferrer and&nbsp; to&nbsp; save him&nbsp; the&nbsp; custody fees, plaintiff directed the sheriff&nbsp; to&nbsp; release&nbsp; the properties from levy, on condition that Ferrer would satisfy the judgment by March 81, 1951, and should he fail to do so, La Tondeña would be at liberty to proceed with the foreclosure.<br><br>On March 13,&nbsp; 1951,&nbsp; the Alto&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; filed&nbsp; complaints (Civil Cases Hos. 241 and&nbsp; 242&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance of Baguio)&nbsp; against Ferrer to recover bond premiums and&nbsp; indemnities paid&nbsp; for his account, and secured writs of preliminary attachment.&nbsp; Then on April 23, 1951 the Provincial Sheriff, at&nbsp; the behest of Alto Surety, attached the very properties mortgaged&nbsp; by&nbsp; Ferrer to La Tondeña, Inc., and which had been the subject of the writ of execution released as heretofore narrated.<br><br>Ferrer&nbsp; not having paid his debt&nbsp; to&nbsp; La Tondeña&nbsp; at the end&nbsp; of&nbsp; March 1951, as stipulated, the mortgagee obtained an alias writ of&nbsp; execution of&nbsp; the judgment in its favor on May 26.&nbsp; But as the&nbsp; properties had been in&nbsp; the meantime attached by&nbsp; Alto Surety,&nbsp; and Alto Surety refused to lift its attachment, the foreclosure sale could not proceed. La Tondeña then filed with the&nbsp; Sheriff a third party claim to the property;&nbsp; the Alto Surety in turn issued an&nbsp; indemnity bond&nbsp; in favor of the Sheriff, guaranteed by the Associated&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; Company, to&nbsp; maintain&nbsp; its levy; and&nbsp; on May 19,1952, the goods were sold at auction at the instance of Alto Surety and purchased&nbsp; by the same for P3,507.50.<br><br>Thereupon La Tondeña, Inc. filed the present complaint for damages against Alto Surety, the Associated Insurance Co., and the Provincial Sheriff of Pangasinan.&nbsp;&nbsp; After due trial,&nbsp; the Court of First Instance dismissed the complaint on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; (1).the release of the levy originally made by the Sheriff in the&nbsp; foreclosure proceedings of La Tondeña's mortgage,&nbsp; extinguished its lien on the goods, and deprived it of preference; (2)&nbsp; that the judgment of foreclosure&nbsp; was novated and extinguished by extension&nbsp; of time and release of execution levy&nbsp; granted by La&nbsp; Tondeña to Ferrer; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; that&nbsp; since Alto Surety&nbsp; had paid off the claims of the first mortgagee,&nbsp; Pedro Ruiz, the surety company&nbsp; became subrogated to the rights of the first mortgagee, and therefore Alto Surety's rights became superior to those of the second mortgagee La Tondena, Inc.&nbsp; The latter appealed the judgment to this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; on points of law exclusively.<br><br>1. As to the alleged&nbsp; extinction&nbsp; of the lien of La Tondeña because of its release of the&nbsp; execution levy, the court below appears to have missed the fact that La Tondeña held a mortgage lien,&nbsp; independent&nbsp; of that arising from the levy. It is&nbsp; true&nbsp; that if&nbsp; the&nbsp; creditor, instead of foreclosing the mortgage,&nbsp; files an ordinary&nbsp; action against the mortgagor, the creditor&nbsp; is deemed to have&nbsp; abandoned&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage (Bachrach Motor&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; vs. Icarañgal, 68 Phil. 287; Manila Trading and Supply Co. vs. Co Kim, 71 Phil. 448 and cases cited).&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is not the&nbsp; case now,&nbsp; for La Tondeña here&nbsp; precisely&nbsp; sued for the foreclosure&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage in&nbsp; its favor, and can&nbsp; not&nbsp; have intended to abandon its mortgage.<br><br>It is&nbsp; apparent that,&nbsp; not having been&nbsp; waived actually or constructively, the mortgage lien&nbsp; held by La Tondeña could not be deemed released merely because the execution levy was discharged without the credit being satisfied.&nbsp; Had La Tondeña not secured a writ of execution on its foreclosure judgment, undeniably the attachment levied at the behest of Alto&nbsp; Surety would have been&nbsp; subordinate to&nbsp; the registered mortgage in favor of La Tondeña and would not supersede it.&nbsp; We&nbsp; see no reason why Alto Surety&nbsp; should&nbsp; be&nbsp; in&nbsp; a better position when an execution levy is&nbsp; made and later lifted than in&nbsp; the case where no&nbsp; such levy at all is had.<br><br>The theory that the judgment lien merged&nbsp; or absorbed (and&nbsp; thereby extinguished) the mortgage&nbsp; lien ignores the fact that the judgment lien depends upon the levy but that of the mortgage is based upon its registration; and that the very&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; the mortgage&nbsp; lien&nbsp; is&nbsp; precisely to assure that a judgment&nbsp; for the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the debt&nbsp; will remain collectible&nbsp; and will&nbsp; be satisfied&nbsp; from the&nbsp; proceeds of the mortgaged property; hence,&nbsp; the purpose of the mortgage lien would be defeated unless it&nbsp; is allowed&nbsp; to stand as long as the foreclosure judgment is in force and is. not satisfied. Until then it&nbsp; can not&nbsp; be&nbsp; contended&nbsp; as appellees do, that the mortgage&nbsp; has become <i>functus officio.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore, as stated in American Jurisprudence, Vol. 37, p. 79,&nbsp; section 596,—<br><blockquote>"Alto there is some conflict on the question, the weight of&nbsp; authority favors the&nbsp; doctrine that a&nbsp; decree&nbsp; of&nbsp; foreclosure does not merge the lien of the mortgage until&nbsp; it&nbsp; has been&nbsp; consummated by sale and satisfaction. The decree does&nbsp; not, it has been said, destroy the lien of&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; but, rather,&nbsp; judicially determines&nbsp; the amount thereof."</blockquote>2.&nbsp; The&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; act&nbsp; of La Tondeña,&nbsp; Inc. in dissolving&nbsp; the execution levy and giving .&nbsp; its debtor until March 31,&nbsp; 1951, wherein to pay, constitutes a novation that extinguished the original judgment, is contrary to the rulings of this Court in Zapanta&nbsp; vs. De Rotaeche, 21 Phil.&nbsp; 154 and Inchausti vs. Yulo, 34 Phil. 978.&nbsp;&nbsp; In both cases, this&nbsp; Court ruled that in order to extinguish or discharge an&nbsp; obligation by&nbsp; novation the intent&nbsp; of the&nbsp; parties to do so&nbsp; (<i>animus novandi</i>) must be either expressed or else&nbsp; clearly apparent&nbsp; from&nbsp; the incompatibility "on all points" of the old and the new obligations&nbsp; (Art. 1204, Civil Code of 1889; Article 1292, new Civil Code); and&nbsp; that the act of giving a debtor <i>more time</i> to pay an obligation is not&nbsp; a novation that will extinguish the&nbsp; original debt. As in the De Rotaeche case, the&nbsp; subsequent arrangement between&nbsp; La Tondeña and&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; debtor&nbsp; Ferrer clearly recognized&nbsp; that the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; of foreclosure&nbsp; continued&nbsp; to be in force, because the arrangement&nbsp; was&nbsp; that if Ferrer did not&nbsp; pay until March 31st, 1951, La&nbsp; Tondeña, Inc. would&nbsp; ask for&nbsp; the&nbsp; execution of&nbsp; the judgment. <br><blockquote>"In the present case, the contract&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to does&nbsp; not expressly extinguish the obligations existing in said judgment.&nbsp; Upon the contrary it&nbsp; expressly recognizes&nbsp; the obligations existing between the parties in said judgment and&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; provides a method by which the same&nbsp; shall be extinguished,&nbsp; which&nbsp; method is,&nbsp; as expressly indicated in&nbsp; said contract, by monthly payments.&nbsp; The&nbsp; contract, instead of containing provisions 'absolutely incompatible' with the&nbsp; obligations of the&nbsp; judgment,&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; ratifies&nbsp; such&nbsp; obligations and&nbsp; contains provisions for satisfying them.&nbsp; The said agreement simply gave the plaintiff a method and more time for the satisfaction of&nbsp; said judgment.&nbsp; It&nbsp; did not&nbsp; extinguish&nbsp; the obligations&nbsp; contained in the judgment, until the terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; contract&nbsp; had&nbsp; been fully complied with.&nbsp; Had the&nbsp; plaintiff continued&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply with the&nbsp; conditions of said contract,&nbsp; he&nbsp; might have&nbsp; successfully invoked&nbsp; its&nbsp; provisions against the issuance of an execution upon&nbsp; the said&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp; The contract and&nbsp; the punctual compliance with its terms only delayed the right of the defendant to&nbsp; an&nbsp; execution&nbsp; upon the judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment&nbsp; was not satisfied and&nbsp; the obligations existing thereunder still&nbsp; subsisted until&nbsp; the&nbsp; terms of&nbsp; agreement had&nbsp; been&nbsp; fully&nbsp; complied with.&nbsp; The plaintiff&nbsp; was&nbsp; bound&nbsp; to&nbsp; perform the&nbsp; conditions mentioned in said contract punctually and fully, in default of which the defendant was remitted&nbsp; to the&nbsp; original rights&nbsp; under his judgment."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Zapanta&nbsp; vs. Be Rotaeche,&nbsp; <i>supra</i>.)</blockquote>That an extension&nbsp; of time does&nbsp; not constitute extinctive novation is&nbsp; evident from&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; extension had to be made a&nbsp; special ground for the&nbsp; extinguishment of the&nbsp; contract of guaranty in&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1851 of&nbsp; the old&nbsp; Code (Article 2079 new Civil Code) notwithstanding that Article 1847 (now 2076)&nbsp; applies or guaranty the same grounds that extinguish all&nbsp; other&nbsp; obligations, naturally including&nbsp; novation. If the extension of the&nbsp; period&nbsp; for payment&nbsp; were included in novation, Article 1851&nbsp; (now 2079), making it a separate ground of discharge&nbsp; would&nbsp; be&nbsp; unnecessary.<br><br>3. The last argument for the appellees is that, by paying off&nbsp; the first mortgage of Pedro Ruiz, Alto&nbsp; Surety became legally surrogated to the rights of the first mortgagee. This stand fails to take into account that such subrogation only occurs upon <i>payment</i> of the first mortgage (Civil Code of 1889, Article 1210; new Civil Code, Article 1302), and that Alto Surety did not begin paying off the first mortgage until March 1952, nor complete its payment until June 19, 1952, while&nbsp; its attachment was&nbsp; levied <i>one&nbsp; year before</i>, in April of 1951.&nbsp; The complaint upon which Alto Surety obtained the&nbsp; attachment in question was not for the foreclosure of&nbsp; first mortgage, and in fact, did not even allege that the first&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; had been&nbsp; paid&nbsp; by Alto Surety.&nbsp; Hence, the subrogation in its favor <i>did not&nbsp; exist</i> when the attachment was levied, nor make the latter&nbsp; superior to the lien of the second mortgagee, La&nbsp; Tondeña,&nbsp; Inc., <i>as&nbsp; of the time be the attachment</i>; nor&nbsp; would it justify the refusal of the appellees to allow the foreclosure sale to proceed, or their rejection of the third party claim filed by the second mortgagee&nbsp; on September 5, 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latter date, La Tondeña, Inc. was already entitled to seize and sell the security&nbsp; (of&nbsp; course, subject to the first "mortgage), and the attaching creditor, Alto Surety, had only a lien subordinate to that of its&nbsp; opponent.&nbsp; The refusal to surrender the mortgaged property being evidently wrongful,&nbsp; the appellees are liable for&nbsp; damages.<br><br>As to the extent of such damages, there is no evidence en record other than the third party claim of La Tondeña, asserting&nbsp; that&nbsp; the goods&nbsp; attached&nbsp; by Alto Surety were worth not less than P7,500; the indemnity bond subscribed by both Alto Surety and Associated Insurance and Surety Co., in the&nbsp; sum of P7,500; and that the attached goods were sold at the instance of Alto&nbsp; Surety, and purchased by it at P8,507&nbsp; (Exhibt 14-Alto).&nbsp; Since&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; did not petition for an&nbsp; increase of the indemnity&nbsp; bond, it&nbsp; is inferable that it was agreeable that the goods attached were not worth&nbsp; more.&nbsp; Considering that La Tondeña&nbsp; was not entitled to the ownership of the disputed goods, but only claimed the right to seize and sell them at public&nbsp; auction <i>subject to the first&nbsp; mortgage</i>,&nbsp; and there&nbsp; being no&nbsp; other pertinent evidence, we believe&nbsp; that there is no&nbsp; basis&nbsp; at present for&nbsp; assessing the&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; damages.&nbsp; As this failure appears due to the concentration of the parties on the main legal question of preference, equity justifies a reopening of&nbsp; the case&nbsp; to admit evidence on the particular issue of&nbsp; damages.<br><br>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing, the decision appealed&nbsp; from is reversed,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the attachment levied on&nbsp; the goods&nbsp; in question&nbsp; by&nbsp; the appellee Alto&nbsp; Surety and Insurance Co. is declared&nbsp; illegal and&nbsp; void.&nbsp; The records&nbsp; are&nbsp; ordered remanded to&nbsp; the court of origin with instructions&nbsp; to re-open the case&nbsp; and&nbsp; receive&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; on&nbsp; the question&nbsp; of damages&nbsp; caused by the&nbsp; illegal&nbsp; attachment.&nbsp; Costs in this instance&nbsp; shall be taxed against the appellees, Alto Surety and&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; and&nbsp; Associated&nbsp; Insurance&nbsp; Co.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Endencia,, JJ</i>., concur.</div>
