				<H3>MORTON F. MEADS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT VS. LAND SETTLEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by plaintiff Morton F. Meads directly to this Court 
from an order of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 21174, 
dismissing his complaint against the Land Settlement and Development Corporation 
for lack of cause of action.
<p>Against plaintiff's original complaint for specific performance of a contract 
of barter, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint 
stated no cause of action. Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that his offer to 
exchange his sawmill equipment and spare parts for some surplus used tractors 
belonging to the defendant, was accepted thereby creating a legal and binding 
contract of barter, but that defendant later refused to comply with the 
contract. The trial court directed plaintiff to exhibit the writing on which the 
allegation or claim of acceptance was based; and the complaint was amended and 
to it was attached and made part thereof the written offer made by plaintiff and 
the written supposed acceptance of said offer. For purposes of reference, we are 
reproducing the two writings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"P. O. Box 1094 <br>Manila, Philippines <br><em>April 20, 
1952</em></p>
<p>The General Manager<br>Land Settlement and Development Corporation <br>Pureza 
Compound, Sta. Mesa Boulevard <br>Manila </p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>I have some sawmill equipment "which I am hereby offering to trade to the 
Land Settlement and Development Corporation for Caterpillar, International or 
Alliz Chalmer tractors.</p>
<p>The sawmill equipment is as described below: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oneâ€”Corinth Sawmill, portable, 60% hand saw, complete with edger, rails husk 
frame, and carriage, and edger ilder.</p>
<p>Plus additional spare parts for all machineries of the sawmill and enough 
parts for one complete additional carriage.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sawmill is rated by the manufacturer at 10,000 board feet in ten hours. 
The sawmill has been only slightly used and it still has the pinewood timber on 
it that the manufacturer placed thereon in the United States. The pinewood not 
being strong enough for Philippine conditions needs replacements on the rails, 
hut otherwise the timber is still satisfactory on all other machineries.</p>
<p>The present price for this type of sawmill, now, is (P18,500), and the spare 
parts on this basis are worth at least (P12,000), for there is almost enough 
additional parts to complete another sawmill.</p>
<p>Since your tractors are in various states of condition and with a variety of 
prices, it is impossible for us to be ttiore specific at this time. However, if 
the Land Settlement and Development Corporation is interested, then the exact 
tractors subject of trade would have to be investigated and considered on the 
basis of their book value.</p>
<p align="right">Very truly yours,<br>(Sgd.) Morton F. Meads"</p>
<p align="right"><em>May 5, 1952 </em></p>
<p>Mr. Morton F. Meads <br>P.O. Box 1094 <br>Manila</p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>In reply to your letter of April 29, 1952 proposing to trade a sawmill for 
some of our tractors, please be informed that we are willing to accept the 
proposition, in which case please see our Mr. F. J. Domantay, of the Property 
Department for a possible arrangement.</p>
<p align="right">Very truly yours,<br>(Sgd.) Marcelo Adduru<br>General 
Manager</p></blockquote>
<p>After examining the two writings, the trial court in its order of March 25, 
1954, now under appeal, found that there was no meeting minds of the parties; 
the tenor of the letter of defendant Corporation is clearly indefinite and did 
not amount to an express and final acceptance, as it uses the phrase "a possible 
arrangement."</p>
<p>We understand that the main and decisive issue involved in the appeal is 
whether the defendant definitely accepted' the offer of plaintiff for exchange. 
Examining the letter of the supposed acceptance, we agree with the trial court 
that the tenor of said letter cannot be construed as an acceptance on the part 
of the defendant. Appellant contends that the clause "we are willing to accept 
the proposition, in which case please see our Mr. F. J. Domantay, of the 
Property Department for possible arrangement" implied acceptance. We disagree. 
We believe that said clause does not in any manner show that defendant had 
definitely accepted the offer. The phrase "willing to accept" does not mean 
acceptance. It merely signifies that the defendant was disposed to accept or was 
agreeable to the proposition or offer, in principle, but that other 
considerations still remained before a contract of barter was perfected. 
Moreover, defendant's letter or answer of May 5, 1952, supposedly expressing 
acceptance, suggested that plaintiff see Mr. Domantay of their Property 
Department "for a possible arrangement" which is an implication that there was 
nothing definite in the contemplated barter, but only a possible arrangement. 
Surely, before definitely agreeing to the barter or exchange, the defendant 
would want first to examine the sawmill equipment offered for exchange, 
especially since it is second hand, according to plaintiff, only slightly used, 
and perhaps would need overhauling and extensive repairs. Again, the offer 
speaks of additional spare parts valued at P12,000.00. Said spare parts had to 
be examined to determine their true value and their relation to the mill itself. 
All this, as regards the sawmill equipment. Now, we come to the number and kind 
of tractors including their prices, which the plaintiff would want for the 
exchange and which the defendant would be willing to give in exchange. The 
parties must also come to a definite agreement as to the said tractors. 
Considering all this, it is clear that as we have already said, the defendant 
merely expressed active interest in the proposed barter because perhaps it could 
make use of the sawmill and that it had more surplus tractors than it had need 
for. In other words, everything was indefinite and in a fluid state, requiring 
further consideration, perhaps even bargaining, and that is why the letter of 
May 5,1952, speaks merely "of a possible arrangement." This is certainly far 
from the acceptance claimed by the appellant.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing., the order appealed from is affirmed, with 
costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista, Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
