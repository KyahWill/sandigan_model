				G.R. No. L-2056, April 27, 1949</h4>
				<H3>SANTIAGO ALERIA ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLANTS, VS. JUAN MENDOZA AND ROMUALDO MOVILLA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> A civil case was filed, for unpaid wages due to a number of 
laborers. There was then a criminal action pending against one of the defendants 
for protracted delay in the payment of said wages as penalized by Commonwealth 
Act No. 503. Said defendant, under Rule 107, of the Rules of Court, asked for 
the suspension of the civil action until the criminal case be finally disposed 
of. The Court granted the request and the laborers appealed.
<p align="justify">The order of suspension is wrong. The rule that a civil action 
shall be suspended until final judgment is rendered in the criminal case, 
applies when the civil action arises from the offense charged in the criminal 
case. Here, the offense charged is extended delay in the payment of wages which 
is penalized by law, and the civil action arises not from such an extended delay 
but from the contract of services entered into by the parties. Whether or not 
there has been a protracted delay, the payment of wages due is demandable. The 
success of the civil action does not depend upon proof of an existing 
offense.</p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, the rule of preference in favor of a criminal case 
does not apply when the civil action is a prejudicial question. (10 
<i>Enciclopedia Juridica Espa√±ola</i>, pp. 229-231.) For instance, in a criminal 
case for bigamy, the civil action for annulment of the second marriage is a 
prejudicial question. In the instant case, the obligation to pay wages is a 
prejudicial question for there can be no extended delay in the payment of such 
obligation unless the obligation be first proved.</p>
<p align="justify">And, finally, action for laborer's wages must be disposed of 
promptly for it concerns necessaries of life for the poor.</p>
<p align="justify">From all the foregoing, the order appealed from is reversed and 
the lower court instructed to try and dispose of the civil action as soon as 
possible, without costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Paras, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p></div>
