				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C. J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>According to the Court of Appeals, "it is  clearly established by  the evidence that on  May 8, 1941, defendant Manuel  Chua Kay in consideration of P17,000 executed  a deed of mortgage in favor  of Lim  Chang  over his  five parcels of land described in Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 52317 and  32915 of Manila and Rizal, respectively, at  12 per  cent  interest per  annum,  payable within  one year from the date of execution (Exhs. '1' and 'A-l'); that on September 19, 1941, Manuel Chua Kay executed another deed of mortgage on the four parcels  of land  described in  the aforementioned  Transfer  Certificate of  Title  No. 52317 in favor of Lim  Chang to secure  the  payment of another sum  of P3,000  within  one year  from  said  date (Exh. '2'  and 'B-1') ;  that mortgagor Manuel Chua Kay failed to  pay his obligation upon the  maturity  of  the two deeds of  mortgage on May 8, 1942  and  on September 19, 1942;  respectively', that sometime in 1944 the mortgagor delivered  the amount of P5,000 to plaintiff as payment  of the  interest due on the mortgage debts up to and including August  31,  1943; and  that on   June 29, 1944,  after plaintiff allegedly refused to  accept payment in Japanese military notes,  defendant deposited with  the Court of First Instance of Manila the sum of P22,066.66 in the so-called mickey mouse money (Exh. '5')."</p>
<p>On  September  8, 1948, the plaintiff  Lim  Chang  (respondent herein)  filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila a complaint for the foreclosure of the two mortgages executed by the defendant  Manuel Chua Kay (petitioner herein).  In his  answer the petitioner  set up  the defense  that the mortgage  debt had already been paid by  the  consignation in  the  Court of  First  Instance of Manila  of  the sum of  P22,066.66 in  war  notes  (Civil Case No. 2547).   On May  11, 1948,  the Court rendered a decision the dispositive part of which reads as follows: "In view of  the  foregoing considerations,  judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and  against the defendant for the sum of Pl,301.99, with compounded interest at the rate of twelve per centum per annum from June 30, 1944 to the  date of the filing of  this complaint, that is,  on September 8, 1948,  and with  interest  at  the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of filing this complaint until the  full amount due is  paid.  The total amount due mentioned above must be paid by  the defendant to the plaintiff or same deposited with the Clerk of Court within  ninety days from the receipt of a copy of this decision, otherwise, the real properties which  are subject of the contracts of mortgages will be sold at public auction  in accordance with law.   Upon payment, however, of the total  amount  due the plaintiff by the defendant within the period mentioned above, the mortgages will be deemed  cancelled and discharged, and the  said defendant shall be entitled to have in  his possession  the  Certificates of Title Nos. 32915 and 52217 free from any  lien or  encumbrance in favor of the plaintiff.  Without pronouncement  as to costs,"</p>
<p>Upon appeal by  the respondent, the Court of Appeals rendered on May 19,  1952,  a decision with the following dispositive part:   "Wherefore,  judgment is  hereby rendered declaring that the sum of  P5,000  tendered  by de-defendant to plaintiff as valid  payment  of  the  interests accruing on the mortgage debts up to and including August 31, 1943; that the  consignation  of 722,066.66 made by defendant on June 29, 1944, was  invalid  and of no force and effect; and sentencing the defendant to pay plaintiff within ninety  (90)  days from  finality of  judgment the total sum of P20,000, the aggregate principal of the two mortgage loans  with interest thereon at the rate of 12 per cent per annum, compounded monthly,  from September 1, 1943, until fully paid, plus  10 per cent of the  total amounts due as attorney's  fees.   Failure  to fully pay the sums which the defendant is sentenced to  pay the plaintiff within said period of ninety (90) days, will  entitle the latter to the foreclosure of the mortgaged properties.  As thus modified,  the  judgment  appealed  from is  hereby affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs."  From this decision  the petitioner has appealed to this  Court by way of certiorari, assigning the  following errors: "I. The Court of Appeals erred in invalidating the consignation made by the petitioner mortgagor in 1944  and in not holding that his liability to the respondent mortgagee was extinguished by such consignation.  II.  The Court  of Appeals erred in not  absolving  the petitioner  from  the payment  of interest and attorney's fees, or at least in  not ordering the revaluation, according to the Ballantyne  scale, of the interest which accrued during the  Japanese occupation.   III. The Court of Appeals erred in awarding excessive damages in the form of attorney's fees."</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals held that the amount of P5,000 delivered by the  petitioner sometime in  1944 and accepted by the respondent,  in payment of interest due on the mortgage debt up to and including August 31, 1943, was binding in view of the respondent's voluntary  acceptance,  although  subject to the condition that he would insist  in  the  future  in  the exact compliance  with  the mortgage contracts.</p>
<p>The  Court of  Appeals held  that the  consignation  of P22,066.66  was not valid  and binding on the  respondent and the loss of said sum consigned in  Japanese military notes should be borne  by  the  petitioner.  The Court  of Appeals expressed  its views on  the  point as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We  shall  now  consider  the sum  of  722,066.66  consigned  by defendant  in  the Court of First Instance of Manila  on  June 29, 1944, for  the  purpose of relieving  himself  from  his  liability to plaintiff  who  allegedly refused  the acceptance thereof.  Under the second paragraph of Article  1177 of the  old Civil  Code 'consignation shall  have no effect  unless made strictly' in accordance with the provisions  governing payment, and according to  Article 1171 of the same  Code, 'payment shall be made at the place designated in the obligation.'  Among the stipulation of the  mortgage contracts (Exhibits  '1'  and 'A-l' and '2' and 'B-1')  is  that payments for the loans,  whether for the  account  of the  principal, interests  or interests on interests,  shall be made  in the domicile of the creditor at Dagupan, Pangasinan.  As the amount of 722,066.66 was deposited with the office of the Clerk of Court  of Manila,  we  are of the opinion  that  it was not done strictly in conformity with the provisions  of  Article  1177 in  relation to  Article 1171  of  the old Civil  Code. Besides,  according to Article 1178  of the  same Code, 'consignation  shall be made  by the  delivery  of  the things  due to the court'  It is undeniable  that only the amount of 722,066.66 in Japanese military notes was deposited in court on  June  29, 1944 (Exh. '5').  Adopting the Ballantyne schedule of values, the Supreme Court held  in the case of Hilado V8. De la Costa, No. L-150, April 80, 1949, that  one Japanese military peso was in June, 1944, equivalent to 7.0220 in terms of Philippine Commonwealth peso or U.S.  dollar. By way  of computation said  722,066.66 is  equal to only 7485.47 in genuine Philippine  peso which is  grossly too small for  720,000, the principal  alone,  excluding the   compounded interests  thereon from  September 1, 1943, to  June 29, 1944.   Even if we  take the face value of the sum  of 722,066.66 still, according  to the trial court, the  same was  short by 71,301.99  for the  satisfaction of the two  mortgage  debts.  And according to  Article 1169  of  the old Civil Code  'unless the contract expressly authorizes it the  creditor cannot be  compelled to accept partial  performances of the undertaking of  which  the  obligation  consists.'  True  that  consignation was  really  made, but  the  same has  neither been made in accordance with  law, nor accepted  by  the  creditor nor approved  by the court, and  in any event there is no clear  proof  before us that the essentials of  a valid  consignation are  here present,  specially the conformity of the preferred payment with the terms of the obligation  which is to be paid.  It  should be stated in this  connection that  strict conformity in that  regard is required, for, as Manresa says, * * * el acreedor  tan solo, y no  el juez puede  autorizar la variation que para los derechos de aquel suponga  la que se intente en el objeto, cuantia o forma de  las  obligaciones.'   (8  Manresa, 312.)   (China Insurance &amp; Surety Co.,  Inc.  <em>vs.</em> B.K. Berkenkotter, C. A.—G.R. No. 332,  April  29, 1949, 46  Off.  Gaz., No. 11, p. 5466.)</p>
  <p>"In view  of the foregoing,  we are of the opinion  and so  hold that  there was no valid consignation made  by defendant on June 29, 1944, and consequently  he could not be released from his obligation  to  plaintiff. For  the purpose of  this  conclusion, it may  be asked:  Who  shall  bear  the  loss  of   the  sum  of P22,066.66  in Japanese military notes?   While  we are  not unmindful  of  the ruling of this Court in  the case of Sia <em>vs.</em>  Valencia, C. A.—G. R. No. 3564-R,  that in a  valid  consignation the loss of the object consigned shall be borne by the creditor, yet, in the  instant  case there has been  no  valid  consignation  and  consequently  it is  the consignor who shall bear  the  loss."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The petitioner  has argued at length on  the  validity of payments made in war notes  during  the Japanese occupation.  Upon  the other hand, the  respondent has  stressed the fact that under  the mortgage  contracts the petitioner was bound to pay in Philippine peso or in United States dollars.  For  the  purpose   of this decision,  we  deem  it unnecessary to touch the aspects of the case thus referred to by the parties, inasmuch as we find the appeal untenable on two grounds, namely, (1) there was no valid consignation and (2)   the consignation case,  No.  2547,  was  not reconstituted.</p>
<p>As to the first, we need only state  that, as  finding of fact, the  Court  of  Appeals  held that  "in the  instant case there has been no  valid consignation and consequently it is the consignor who shall bear the loss."  Indeed, quoting the decision in China  Insurance and Surety  Co., Inc. <em>vs.</em>  Berkenkotter,  C. A.-G. R.  No.  332, April  29, 1949, 46 Off. Gaz., No. 11, p.  5466, the Court of Appeals pointed out: "True that  consigntaion  was really made,  but  the same has neither been  made in accordance with  law,  nor accepted by the creditor nor approved by the court, and in any  event there  is no  clear proof before  us  that the essentials of a valid consignation are here present, specially the conformity of the preferred  payment with the terms of the obligation which is  to be paid.   It should be stated in this  connection that strict  conformity in  that regard is required, for as  Manresa says, '*  * * el acreedor tan solo, y  no  el juez puede autorizar 1a variacion que para los derechos de aquel suponga la que se intente  en el objeto, cuantia  o forma de  las obligaciones"  (8  Manresa, 312.)"</p>
<p>With  reference to the  second ground, even assuming that there was a valid consignation in Civil Case No. 2547, the failure of  the petitioner to  have said case duly reconstituted, has reduced the same to  a nothingness (Vda. de Valenzuela <em>vs.</em> De Aquino, 84 Phil., 507, 47 Off. Gaz., 139), and amounted to a waiver  on the  part  of  the petitioner of his right to said consignation (Felicidad Ambat <em>vs.</em> The Director of  Lands, 49 Off. Gaz., p. 129).</p>
<p>There is no  merit in petitioner's second assignment  of error, regarding the award of  interest and attorney's fees in favor of the  respondent, since  they are items stipulated in the mortgage  contracts and there  was default on the part of  the petitioner.  The interest accrued under the  contracts executed before the war.   The rate fixed for attorney's fees is obviously reasonable, considering the duration of the litigation and the services  rendered by counsel  for the respondent in  three instances.</p>
<p>Even from the point view of equity,  we readily  think that the appealed decision is proper, considering that the loans were granted before  the war in  Philippine currency.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
