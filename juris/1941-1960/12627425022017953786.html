				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Maria L. Aldana filed a complaint for disbarment against Attys.&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; M.&nbsp; Abad&nbsp; and Dominador&nbsp; Somera.&nbsp; In view of their failure to&nbsp; file&nbsp; an answer&nbsp; to the&nbsp; complaint within the period granted them, and upon motion of Atty. Francisco M. Abad,&nbsp; the Court referred&nbsp; the matter to the Solicitor&nbsp; General&nbsp; for investigation, report and recommendation.&nbsp; On January&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1954, the&nbsp; Solicitor General filed a formal complaint&nbsp; only against Atty.&nbsp; Francisco M. Abad,&nbsp; alleging in substance that the respondent agreed to take charge of&nbsp; collecting the retirement gratuity of. Feliciano Aldana, deceased husband of&nbsp; Maria de Aldana, under the Osmeña Retirement Act No. 2589; that the respondent caused Maria de&nbsp; Aldana to execute in his favor a power of attorney to receive and sign the retirement check; that the respondent delivered to Maria&nbsp; de Aldana the sum of P696, out of which&nbsp; she paid to the respondent the sum of P50&nbsp; as fee;&nbsp; that subsequently Maria&nbsp; de Aldana learned from other sources that&nbsp; the&nbsp; retirement&nbsp; gratuity collected by the respondent amounted to P4,000; that without notice to and previous conformity of Maria de&nbsp; Aldana, the respondent disposed of the said P4.000 in the following manner: P2.500 to the&nbsp; heirs of Feliciano Aldana by his first marriage; P696&nbsp; to Maria de&nbsp; Aldana&nbsp; (in representation of the heirs of Feliciano Aldana by his&nbsp; second marriage) ; and&nbsp; P800 for expenses and fees&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent; that the sum of&nbsp; P800 retained by the respondent as expenses and fees are excessive and&nbsp; unreasonable; that the acts of the respondent constitute&nbsp; abuse of the&nbsp; confidence reposed in him by Maria&nbsp; de Aldana.&nbsp; The Solicitor General prayed that proper&nbsp; disciplinary action be taken against the respondent; that the fee of respondent be fixed, considering that the&nbsp; laws&nbsp; of the United States and&nbsp; the Philippines allow&nbsp; only ten&nbsp; per&nbsp; cent; ,and that&nbsp; the respondent be ordered to return to the heirs of the&nbsp; deceased Feliciano Aldana the&nbsp; difference between P800&nbsp; and the&nbsp; fee&nbsp; to be thus fixed by this&nbsp; Court.&nbsp; In his answer the respondent alleged in substance and effect that he acted in good faith in the matter,&nbsp; having divided&nbsp; the sum&nbsp; of P4,000 in the manner alleged by the Solicitor General, bearing in&nbsp; mind the interest of the heirs of the deceased Feliciano Aldana both by&nbsp; his first marriage and&nbsp; by his&nbsp; second marriage, the heirs of the first marriage being represented by Lt. Emiliano Aldana who was in a more solvent position and willing to&nbsp; make necessary adjustments&nbsp; should Maria&nbsp; de Aldana&nbsp; claim&nbsp; and be&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; to an&nbsp; amount&nbsp; more than P696; that the sum&nbsp; of P800 kept by the respondent1 was&nbsp; not excessive,&nbsp; considering&nbsp; that he took many steps, went from one office to another, and&nbsp; made several&nbsp; trips from&nbsp; Pangasiñan to Manila, all because Maria de Aldana wanted to collect the gratuity as soon as possible.<br><br>All things considered, we held that while the disbursements made by the&nbsp; respondent might have been in good faith, because there&nbsp; are admittedly two&nbsp; sets of heirs and the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P800&nbsp; kept by the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; represented not&nbsp; only his fee but also his&nbsp; expenses,&nbsp; nevertheless the respondent should have informed his&nbsp; principal, Maria&nbsp; de Aldana,&nbsp; about the exact amount paid by the Government and consulted her before delivering to the heirs of Feliciano Aldana by his first marriage the sum of P2,500.&nbsp;&nbsp; In failing to observe that formality&nbsp; which seems to be elementary, but&nbsp; which is&nbsp; not so grave an&nbsp; omission as&nbsp; to warrant suspension or disbarment, the&nbsp; respondent merits at&nbsp; least a reprimand.<br><br>It may be claimed on behalf of Maria de Aldana or the heirs of&nbsp; Feliciano Aldana by his second marriage that the sum of P696 is legally insufficient or out of&nbsp; proportion; the&nbsp; matter of&nbsp; adjustment may&nbsp; be&nbsp; threshed out by said heirs on the one hand and the heirs by the first marriage.<br><br>Wherefore, the respondent is hereby reprimanded,&nbsp; with the warning that a repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely.<br><br><i>Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Concepcion</i> and <i>Reyes, J.
