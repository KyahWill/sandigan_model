				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The four appellants were prosecuted in the Court of First Instance of 
Cotabato for murder. Having been found guilty and appealed, they have made the 
following assignments of error:
<ol><li>
<p>The trial court erred in holding that the alleged crime was committed within 
its territorial jurisdiction;</p>
</li><li>
<p>The trial court erred in holding that the evidence was sufficient to 
establish the existence of the alleged victim;</p>
</li><li>
<p>The trial court erred in believing the witnesses for the prosecution and in 
refusing to believe the witnesses for appellants;</p>
</li><li>
<p>The trial court showed bias against appellants;</p>
</li><li>
<p>The trial court erred in interpreting unfavorably against three of the 
appellants their failure to testify on their behalf; and</p>
</li><li>
<p>The trial court erred in denying appellants' motion for a new trial and in 
convicting appellants.</p></li></ol>
<p>Two witnesses who swore to having seen the commission of the crime gave 
evidence for the prosecution. Talib Gotum testified that on April 27, 1945, at 
about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, he went to the house of Malantawan Midsapac in 
Maridagao, taking along a bolo. Malantawan was working in the field and he sat 
under the house. Later the four accused arrived, took his bolo from him, told 
him to catch chickens, and called for Malantawan. When Malantawan appeared they 
told him to give them palay and Malantawan said he could not give them any 
because he had very little. Angered by Malintawan's refusal the accused 
surrounded and seized him, and one of them, Anganan, held and tied his hands, 
Malantawan cried out for help, and while he was struggling to free himself the 
accused Sobanon struck him on the left shoulder with the witness' bolo which 
sank down to the middle of the breast. Malantawan fell dead. The witness, who 
had stopped chasing chickens and hid behind banana clumps, ran awoy after he saw 
Malantawan struck, to warn his foks that there were bad people around. At night 
he went to report the crime to Datu Tomindog in the latter's house.</p>
<p>The other witness, Malabong Bodad, said he lived in Maridagao near Malantawan 
Midsapac, and knew the accused. At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon on April 27, 
1945, he saw the accused "wrestling with Malantewan." They succeeded in tying 
Malantawan, after which Sabanon slashed him at the base of the neck. Malantawan 
fell down upon which he (witness) ran with his wife and other members of his 
household to the house of Datu Tomindog and reported what he had seen.</p>
<p>Datu Sorotan Tomindog testified that at 7 o'clock p. m. of April 27, 1945, he 
met Talib Gotum running and trembling. Gotum told him that Sobanon had killed 
Malantawan and that he was afraid. After hearing this he went to see the 
deceased. He found Malantawan dead and buried him. Malabong Badad had arrived at 
his house before he met Talib Gotum. Malabong Bodad was trembling too when he 
came.</p>
<p>Sobanon Kalim and his cousin, Sastria de Falle, were put on the stand for the 
defense. The other three accused did not testify. Sobanon Kalim and Sastria de 
Falle testified in substance that the Americans returned to Pikit on April 20, 
1945, at 2 o'clock p. m. In the morning of that date they evacuated from Pikit 
to Along because there were Japanese forces in Pikit and they wanted to get away 
from the fighting. With them were the defendants Kamad, Palalisan Tamiki and 
Anganan Pala-lisan. In Along they stayed two nights; as Japanese were 
patrolling, they moved on to Tacupan Creek on April 22 building a shack there. 
On April 24, 1945, they continued the work on the shack. On the 25th Sobanon and 
Anganan were attacked by malaria. On the 26th they were seriously ill. Their 
chill, complicated with "pasmo", persisted on to the 27th. Until the 30th these 
two defendants were sick. On the 7th of May Sobanon and Anganan had recovered. 
The four accused then went out to see how conditions were.</p>
<p>Sobanon's land was not far from Tacupan Creek, the witnesses declared. They 
visited Sobanon's land in April and met Sobanon's half-sister who told them that 
Datu Tomindog had planted posts on that land with intention to build a house and 
grab the homestead. What Sobanon did was pull out the posts, after which they 
returned to Tacupan Creek with some bananas. On the 8th of May they went back to 
Pikit. At Maridagao crossing, the four accused were arrested and placed "in the 
compound". At 8:30 Datu Tomindog arrived and said to Sobanon, "I want to take 
revenge on you because you pulled out my posts. I can revenge because I am a 
datu. But, Sobanon, if you will give me your land I think I can help you. If 
not, you will rot in jail." They remembered these dates because they kept a 
handwritten calendar for April.</p>
<p>The trial court did not give credence to the testimony of Sobanon and Sastria 
de Falle pointing out flaws in said testimony which it considered fatal to its 
veracity. On the otherhand it gave full credit to the testimony of the witnesses 
for the prosecution which it said is positive and clear.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the respect to which the findings of the trial Judge are 
entitled, the relation of the prosecution witnesses to the deceased and the 
defendants and the tenor and quality of their story, reveal no circumstance 
which impeaches their credibility. Their statements are consistent, cogent, and 
ring with naturalness, frankness and sincerity. Granting that Tomindog had a 
grudge against Sobanon - a commonplace formula resorted to to discredit a 
witness - the defendants have not so much as attempted to show that the other 
two witnesses had any improper motive to perjure themselves. Nor have they tried 
to explain why Tomindog included in his "revenge" his enemy's co-accused with 
whom Tomindog had not had any unpleasantness.</p>
<p>The insinuation that Malantawan Midsapac was a fictitious person and that 
this prosecution is a fabrication out of whole cloth is even more unreasonable. 
The defendants would have us believe that unlettered, untutored country folks as 
are the government witnesses, utterly inexperienced in the ways of the courts, 
they succeeded in putting over the prosecuting attorney and the trial court a 
hoax which not many able lawyers could put through.</p>
<p>It is said that "the only evidence presented to establish the existence of 
the alleged victim is the oral testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution" 
and that "neither a death certificate nor a burial certificate of the alleged 
victim was presented in evidence" The absence of death or burial certificate 
ought not, In the least, to put in doubt the reality of the killing. Malantawan 
Midsapac was killed and buried in a country place far from the seat of the 
district or municipality and at a time when, to judge from the defendants' 
evidence, the battle for liberation of the province was just about to begin or 
had just begun. The province of Cotabato was declared liberated on November 11, 
1945. As a matter of practice and procedure, death certificate is not 
indispensable. If it were, numerous murders would go unpunished. Corpus delicti 
is the fact of the commission of the crime which may be proved by the testimony 
of eye-witnesses who saw it. The testimony of Talib Gotum, Malabong Budad and 
Datu Tomindog is, legally and factually, overwhelmingly sufficient to establish 
the death of the offended party.</p>
<p>With reference to the venue there is abundant evidence to prove that the 
place of the crime is in the province of Cotabato. Talib Gotum and Malabong 
Budad lived in Maradigao, and Datu Tomindog styled himself as mayor of that 
barrio or sitio. The court correctly took cognizance of the fact that Maradigao, 
as alleged in the information, is in the municipal district of Balatican, in the 
province of Cotabato. It is said, without a scintilla of proof, that there are 
other places called Maridagao in Lanao and Bukidnon. But the witnesses for the 
defense themselves have shown by their testimony that they lived in Pikit, the 
jurisdiction of whose justice of the peace comprised the municipal district of 
Balatican; they spoke of "Maridagao crossing" as the place where the four 
defendants were arrested; and they accused Datu Tomindog of trying to usurp the 
land of Subanon. These details induce the inference that the accused and the 
witnesses for the prosecution lived not far from one another in the province of 
Cotabato. There is not the slightest suggestion in the record that the crime at 
bar may have been perpetrated outside that province.</p>
<p>The unfavorable comment made by the trial court on the failure of the three 
defendants to testify is not a reversible error, supposing without deciding, 
that it was error. This comment does not destroy or weaken the evidence against 
the accused.</p>
<p>The alleged bias of the trial judge does not appear on the record. Anyhow, 
there is no showing that the conduct of the trial judge has prejudiced in any 
manner the appellants' constitutional right to a fair hearing.</p>
<p>The appellants were properly found guilty of murder. The killing was 
qualified by treachery. Sobanon Kalim who had attended school up to the 7th 
grade was sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. The rest of the defendants 
were sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from 12 years of prision mayor to 
20 years years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, the court having appreciated in 
their favor the mitigating circumstance of lack of education. The four accused 
were also sentenced to pay jointly and severally P2,000 to the heirs of the 
deceased as indemnity and each to pay one-fourth of the costs.</p>
<p>The judgment is correct and the same is affirmed with costs of this appeal 
against the appellants.</p><em>Parás, Feria, Perfecto</em>, and <em>Bengzon, 
JJ.</em>, concur. </div>
