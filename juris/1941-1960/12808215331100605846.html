				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The petitioner-appellant is a member of the Manila Police 
Department.  He was charged administratively before and investigated by 
the summary court of the Manila Police Department for gross misconduct, 
and based on said investigation the respondent Mayor ordered his 
dismissal from the service effective September 20, 1950, the date of his
 suspension.
  <p>    The appellant instituted a petition for certiorari and mandamus
 in the Court of First Instance of Manila, praying that the proceedings 
followed by the respondents City Mayor de la Fuente, Chief of Police 
Quintos and Colonel Juan that led to his suspension and dismissal be 
declared null and void, and that he be reinstated as regular member of 
the Manila Police Department with salary from September 20, 1950.  After
 hearing, the Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision 
dismissing the petition, from which the petitioner has appealed.</p>
  <p>    In the appealed decision the Court of First Instance of Manila 
held that Republic Act No. 557, approved on June 17, 1950, has repealed 
Republic Act No. 409 with reference to the matter of suspension and 
removal of members of the Manila Police Department.  Even so, the court 
proceeded to dismiss appellant's petition on the ground that, in his 
affidavit of September 13, 1950 (Exhibit 1), he had admitted the 
commission of gross misconduct in office.  In other words, the lower 
court held that, although the procedure prescribed in Republic Act No. 
557 was not followed, in view of appellant's alleged admission, his 
immediate dismissal by the respondent Mayor was in order.</p>
  <p>    The lower court erred.  In the petition for certiorari and 
mandamus the question presented is whether the summary court of the 
Manila Police Department had jurisdiction to conduct the investigation 
of the administrative charges against the appellant, and whether the 
dismissal based on said investigation is legal.  Said petition does not 
involve the merits of the findings of the summary court and of the 
decision of the respondent Mayor.</p>
  <p>    It being admitted that the procedure followed by the 
respondents in investigating, suspending and dismissing the appellant is
 not in conformity with Republic Act No. 557 which, as we have already 
held in Manuel vs. de la Fuente, et al., G.R. No. L-5009, decided 
November 29, 1952, has repealed or modified section 22 of Republic Act 
No. 409, insofar as the power of investigation over members of the 
Manila Police Department is concerned, we have to rule, as we hereby 
rule, that the investigation conducted by the summary court of the 
Manila Police Department and the appellant's suspension and removal 
premised on said investigation are of no force and effect.</p>
  <p>    Counsel for the appellant has intimated — though not raised in 
respondent's answer in the court below — that Republic Act No. 557 would
 be rendered unconstitutional if construed as repealing section 22 of 
Republic Act No. 409, because while its title speaks of "the suspension 
or removal of members of the provincial governor, city mayor or 
municipal mayor," the body of the Act vests the same power in the 
provincial board and municipal or city council, in violation of section 
21 of Article VI of the Constitution providing that no bill which may be
 enacted into law shall embody more than one subject which shall be 
expressed in the title of the bill.  From a reading of Republic Act No. 
557, however, it is plain that the provincial governor, city mayor and 
municipal mayor are conferred the power of suspension conformably to the
 provisions thereof, and although the Act vests the power of 
investigation in the provincial board and municipal or city council, it 
does not provide that the power or removal is in said bodies.  Hence, it
 cannot be argued that the subject as expressed in the title is not the 
same as that embodied in the body of the Act.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby reversed and the 
respondents are ordered to reinstate the petitioner-appellant in his 
position as regular member of the Manila Police Department, with right 
to receive his salaries from September 20, 1950.  So ordered without 
costs.</p>

Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i> and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur. </p>
