				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-2423, May 26, 1949</h4>
				<H3>M. A. ZARCAL, MAGDALENA DE ZARCAL AND HERIBERTO ZARCAL, PETITIONERS, VS. S. HERRERO, REMEDIOS HERRERO VDA. DE GONZALES, FILOMENA VDA. DE HERRERO, FELIPE NATIVIDAD, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, AND THE SHERIFF OF CITY OF MANILA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In an ejectment case between respondent S. Herrero, as 
plaintiff, and herein petitioners, as defendants (civil case No. 2801), the 
municipal court of Manila rendered a decision on March 5, 1947, sentencing the 
petitoners to vacate the premises in question and to pay to respondent Herrero 
the monthly rental of P77 from January 1, 1947, until the premises shall have 
been vacated, plus the costs.
<p align="justify">Upon appeal by the petitioners to the Court of First Instance 
of Manila, the respondent Judge, Hon. Felipe Natividad, rendered a decision 
dismissing the complaint, with costs against the plaintiffs (it appears that in 
the Court of First Instance the complaint was amended so as to include other 
parties plaintiff). The plaintiffs (herein respondents other than the respondent 
judge and the respondent sheriff), duly submitted their record on appeal as one 
of the steps for elevating the case to the Court of Appeals. In the meantime, or 
on May 9, 1948, the respondent Herrero and others filed a petition with teh 
Court of First Instance of Manila for the execution of the decision of the 
municipal court, on the ground that the defendants (herein petitioners) failed 
to pay or deposit the rentals for the months of January to May, 1948. On August 
9, 1948, the respondent judge of the Court of First Instance of Manila issued an 
order granting the aforesaid petition and directing the issuance of a writ for 
the execution of the judgment of the municipal court. On the same date, or 
August 9, 1948, the record on appeal filed by the plaintiffs (herein respondents 
other than respondent judge and respondent sheriff) was approved by the 
respondent judge, and the case was ordered certified to the Court of 
Appeals.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioners have instituted the present petition for 
certiorari, with a view to obtaining the annulment of the order directing the 
issuance of a writ of execution against the petitioners. There is merit in said 
petition. We have already held that the judgment of the municipal court is 
superseded by the judgment of the Court of First Instance, and the latter court 
cannot order the execution of said judgment of hte municipal court which has 
become <i>functus oficio</i> (De la Fuente and Teodoro, vs. Jugo and Borromeo, 
76 Phil., 262). The action of the respondent judge in ordering the execution of 
the decision of the municipal court, in spite of the judgment of said respondent 
in favor of the herein petitioners, amounts to a reversal of his own judgment 
pending appeal by the plaintiffs (herein respondents other than respondent judge 
and respondent sheriff).</p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, it appears that the execution was ordered on the 
ground that herein petitioners failed to pay the rentals awarded in the decision 
of the municipal court. This is erroneous not only because the rental to be paid 
or deposited by the defendant in an ejectment case pending appeal form a 
judgment o fthe Court of First Instance, is that determined by the latter court 
(Romero vs. Pecson, 83 Phil., 308)—in the case at bar the judgment of the Court 
of First Instance dismissed the complaint,—but because the defendant in an 
ejectment case has to pay or deposit said rentals only in case he appeals from 
the judgment of the Court of First Instance, in order to stay ececution. In the 
case now before us, the petitioners are not bound to pay or deposit said 
rentals, because it is the plaintiffs (herein respondents other than respondent 
judge and respondent sheriff) who have appealed from the decision of the Court 
of First Instance. (Rule of Court No. 72, section 9.)</p>
<p align="justify">The petition for certiorari is hereby granted and the order of 
the respondent judge in civil case No. 2102, directing the issuance of a writ 
for the execution of the judgment of the municipal court, is set aside. The writ 
of preliminary injunction heretofore issued is made permanent. So ordered, with 
costs against the respondents other than respondent judge and respondent 
sheriff.</p> <i>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, 
Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
