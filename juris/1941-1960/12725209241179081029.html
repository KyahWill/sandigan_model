				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision by the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila,&nbsp; then presided by Judge Conrado V. Sanchez, new an Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, dismissing&nbsp; plaintiff's complaint as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as&nbsp; the counter-claim of the defendants.<p>The appeal is predicated on the grounds that the lower court erred: </p><blockquote><p>"I.&nbsp; In finding that the defendant Drr Cornelio S. Tantoco&nbsp; was not a&nbsp; party&nbsp; to the contract of lease of the fishpond in question, and consequently erred in exempting&nbsp; him from&nbsp; any&nbsp; and all liabilities&nbsp; arising out&nbsp; of the lease&nbsp; agreement;</p><p>II. In finding the P200,000 Japanese war notes' as full payment and satisfaction of rentals from November 15, 1944 to November 15, 1945, and in not finding the same&nbsp; as deposit to guarantee and secure the payment of the corresponding , monthly&nbsp; rentals at the rate of Pl6,666.66 1/3 which deposit is amply supported by the&nbsp; surrounding circumstances and&nbsp; the abnormal&nbsp; and&nbsp; chaotic conditions prevailing&nbsp; at the time;</p><p>III.&nbsp; In not finding document Exhibit J, dated&nbsp; October 17, 1944 as a mere&nbsp; 'receipt and provisional contract of lease'&nbsp; subject to such clear&nbsp; and&nbsp; manifest intention of&nbsp; the parties thereto to&nbsp; execute at a later date (October 19,&nbsp; 1944)&nbsp; a final contract of lease containing the true, real&nbsp; and agreed terms&nbsp; and conditions&nbsp; as contained on document&nbsp; Exhibit K;</p><p>IV.&nbsp; In not finding that the&nbsp; true, real and agreed&nbsp; terms and conditions&nbsp; of the lease agreement&nbsp; are those&nbsp; appearing on&nbsp; document&nbsp; Exhibit K, which defendants deliberately&nbsp; and&nbsp; intentionally failed to&nbsp; execute;</p><p>V. In not condemning the defendants to pay, jointly and severally, the plaintiff&nbsp; the corresponding rentals at the&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of P16,666.16 1/3 Philippine&nbsp; currency a&nbsp; month,&nbsp; commencing February 15, 1945 to November&nbsp; 15, 1945, inclusive, and in holding that plaintiff's intention was to enrich himself at the expense of&nbsp; (or to&nbsp; the&nbsp; injury of) another;</p><p>VI.&nbsp; In finding that the plaintiff is seized with that atavistic propensity to&nbsp; jump from one theory to another in the hope of obtaining beneficial&nbsp; results, and in&nbsp; considering independent cases&nbsp; of the plaintiff in other courts as basis for such findings (Exhibits 7 and 8-Tamayo), thereby creating in the mind of the court prejudice and contempt against the&nbsp; plaintiff by&nbsp; dismissing in toto plaintiff's claims in the case at bar;</p><p>VII.&nbsp; In finding that the&nbsp; plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified in the sum&nbsp; of P6,000 Philippine&nbsp; currency, representing the&nbsp; value of 3,700 bangus try which defendant failed to&nbsp; deliver&nbsp; to the plaintiff at the expiration of the lease, pursuant to the agreement.</p><p>VIII. In .finding that the&nbsp; damages on the fishpond represented by photographs&nbsp; A-3, A-4 and A-5&nbsp; refer to. tot&nbsp; l-B-3 which does not belong to plaintiff and in further finding that these photographs were taken by photographer&nbsp; Pablo Calayag not in November 1945; shortly after the expiration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; lease,&nbsp; but in June or July&nbsp; of 1946; and consequently erred in denying plaintiff's claim for damages for P50,000;</p><p>IX. In finding that the plaintiff failed to prove that repairs were made on&nbsp; the fishpond before and after the lease, and&nbsp; in holding the lack&nbsp; of authenticity and genuineness&nbsp; of the&nbsp; various receipts evidencing payments for such repairs among them Exhibits&nbsp; G, G-l,&nbsp; G-2, G-8, G-4 and G-5; H,&nbsp; H-l, H-2, H-3&nbsp; and M-l and consequently&nbsp; in denying the plaintiffs claims for actual damages in the sum of M.4,100;</p><p>X, In&nbsp; finding that the fishpond&nbsp; was delivered tot and accepted by&nbsp; Ciriaco Calayag&nbsp; in good conditions&nbsp; and in further holding that Ciriaco Galayag was an encargado of the plaintiff duly authorized to accept the same&nbsp; for the&nbsp; defendants;</p><p>XI. In denying plaintiff's motion for a new&nbsp; trial dated September 3, 1953, the A admission of&nbsp; such newly discovered evidence&nbsp; being of such material and transcendental importance&nbsp; that would enable the trial court to have a more full, detailed and&nbsp; complete facts&nbsp; of the case at bar that&nbsp; would have helped the said trial cemrfc to arrive at a&nbsp; just, fair and impartial judgment en&nbsp; the issues&nbsp; involved.".</p></blockquote><p>The issues involved in&nbsp; the appeal, as clearly pointed out by the appellant&nbsp; on page&nbsp; 18 of Ms&nbsp; brief,&nbsp; are reduced&nbsp; to the following propositions:&nbsp; </p><ol><li> Whether&nbsp; or not Dr. Cornelio S. Tantoco was a party to the contract of lease of the fishpond in question;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>Whether or not the P200,000&nbsp; in&nbsp; Japanese&nbsp; war notes&nbsp; was&nbsp; a mere deposit to guarantee or secure the&nbsp; payment of the monthly rentals at the&nbsp; rate of P16,666.66 1/3 from November 15, 1944&nbsp; to November 15, ,1945; or in full payment and satisfaction&nbsp; of&nbsp; a year rentals of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; fishpond;<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Whether or not Exhibit J, is the final contract of lease between the parties; or&nbsp; that the true, real and agreed terms and conditions of the&nbsp; lease agreement are&nbsp; those embodied on Exh. K which the defendants deliberately and intentionally failed to execute; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>Whether or not&nbsp; Ciriaco&nbsp; Calayag was the&nbsp; encargado&nbsp; of&nbsp; Dr. Vicente Valencia, with authority to accept the return and delivery of&nbsp; the&nbsp; fishpond in question&nbsp; on November 15, 1945;<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Whether or not the fishpond was actually&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; in&nbsp; good conditions by the defendants on&nbsp; November 15, 1945, or was it left and&nbsp; abandoned by the&nbsp; defendants as a retaliatory&nbsp; act for filing the plaintiff's complaint on July 26, 1945;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to the damages claimed, and the defendants are jointly and severally liable for said damages.</li></ol><p>We have read the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from and the evidence presented by both parties and We find that none of the&nbsp; errors assigned by the appellant has&nbsp; been committed by the lower court.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the issues now raised were fully. clearly and exhaustively discussed&nbsp; and&nbsp; disposed&nbsp; of in&nbsp; the decision which we could&nbsp; hardly improve, for which reason we adopt it as our own. It says</p><blockquote><p>"Plaintiff, Vicente&nbsp; Valencia,&nbsp; seeks to recover from&nbsp; defendants Cornelio Tantoco and Amado C. Tamayo (1)&nbsp; rentals at the rate of P16,666.66&nbsp; per&nbsp; month&nbsp; from February 15, 1945 to&nbsp; November&nbsp; 15, 1945, on&nbsp; a fishpond&nbsp; located in Marulao,&nbsp; Hagonoy,&nbsp; Bulacan;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) P6,000 damages&nbsp; arising out&nbsp; of&nbsp; defendants' failure&nbsp; to replace about 3,700 bangus seedlings left with the fishpond at the time defendants took possession thereof; and (3) P64,000 damages suffered by plaintiff by reason of defendants' abandonment of said fishpond in an unserviceable&nbsp; condition upon the expiration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; one year lease , from November 15, 1944 to November 15,&nbsp; 1945.</p><p>Defendant Cornelio&nbsp; Tantoco&nbsp; disclaims&nbsp; liability&nbsp; under the lease agreement sued upon, alleges&nbsp; that he&nbsp; is neither&nbsp; party nor&nbsp; privy to that contract, and&nbsp; sets up&nbsp; a counterclaim for&nbsp; damages planted upon the&nbsp; averment&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff included said defendant&nbsp; in&nbsp; the complaint&nbsp; maliciously&nbsp; and knowing that no cause of action exists against the latter.</p><p>Defendant Amado C.

First, ;fche contract is no&nbsp; longer with&nbsp; Amado C. Tamayo alone&nbsp; but with both Tamayo and Tantoeo, defendants herein.&nbsp; Second,&nbsp; it requires that monthly rentals should be paid at the rate of P16,666.66 1/3 every month beginning with&nbsp; the month of November, 1944,&nbsp; and any and all payments of monthly rental must be of the actual currency as&nbsp; recognized&nbsp; by the&nbsp; constituted government&nbsp; in the Philippines.'&nbsp; Both Tamayo and&nbsp; Tantoco refused to sign&nbsp; this proposed contract Exhibit&nbsp; K.</p><p>Pursuant to an understanding had between plaintiff and defendant Tamayo on November 10, 1945, after the last&nbsp; fishes (simot) were taken, the&nbsp; fishpond&nbsp; was returned&nbsp; to&nbsp; Ciriaco&nbsp; Calayag,&nbsp; plaintiff's encargado.&nbsp; Calayag went around the fishpond,&nbsp; found it in good condition, and&nbsp; accepted the same from Tamayo.</p><p>1. First in point of inquiry is the question whether or not plaintiff lias a cause&nbsp; of action&nbsp; against&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Cornelio&nbsp; Tantoco. Plaintiff's theory in all his pleadings—in his original, first amended, and second&nbsp; amended complaints&nbsp; consistently was that the two defendants leased the fishpond&nbsp; from him.</p><p>On the witness stand, however, plaintiff, testifying in his favor, presented for the court's consideration three theories contradictory to&nbsp; each other.&nbsp; First theory:&nbsp; Plaintiff testified that, in reference to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fishpond in question, the lease&nbsp; agreement was between him and Cornelio Tantoco alone, and that defendant Amado Tamayo was merely&nbsp; a 'go-between'&nbsp; for&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; tr. p. 470.&nbsp; On&nbsp; this&nbsp; point, plaintiff's testimony is&nbsp; buttressed by documentary evidence&nbsp; of his own making, Exhibits B, B-2, B-3, B-U, B-5 and C.&nbsp; In fact, he said that Tamayo had written authority to sign for Tantoco, tr.&nbsp; p. 247. See also tr. pp. 131, 134, 144, 148, 161. Second theory:&nbsp; The second theory&nbsp; saddled upon the court&nbsp; by plaintiff is that the contract of lease was between&nbsp; him on&nbsp; one hand and defendants Tantoco&nbsp; and Tamayo&nbsp; on the other, tr. pp.&nbsp; 142, 153, 158-159,&nbsp; 161, 166, 167, 172-174, 176, 177,&nbsp; 184. Plaintiff's third&nbsp; theory&nbsp; is&nbsp; that&nbsp; really the lease&nbsp; contract&nbsp; was&nbsp; with&nbsp; defendant Tamayo,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that defendant Tantoco only acted&nbsp; in&nbsp; representation&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tamayo.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>'Q. Why was Atty.&nbsp; Macapagal&nbsp; able&nbsp; to put&nbsp; in&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; 2- Tamayo from&nbsp; whom&nbsp; you received the money,&nbsp; if you did not tell him from whom you&nbsp; received it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A. I told him that&nbsp; I had received the P20,000 delivered personally by Dr. Tantoco in representation of Mr. Tamayo.'&nbsp; tr. 241.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>It thus appears that&nbsp; plaintiff, in open court, has actually bandied his theory as to who was the lessee, from Tantoco,&nbsp; to Tamayo and Tantoco, and then to Tamayo&nbsp; and finallyback to&nbsp; Tantoco alone. tr. p. 470.</p><p>The rigmarole&nbsp; into which the court's&nbsp; mind is ushered by such conflicting&nbsp; theories&nbsp; will prevent the court&nbsp; from&nbsp; giving its imprimatur to plaintiff's wobbly claim that Tantoco is&nbsp; a party to the contract.&nbsp; Registering indelibly in the mind of the&nbsp; court&nbsp; is that plaintiff,&nbsp; by&nbsp; his&nbsp; own words&nbsp; and his&nbsp; pleadings,&nbsp; failed to&nbsp; nail down the question of Tantojco's liability.</p><p>Examining&nbsp; the&nbsp; written evidence of record,&nbsp; it will appear&nbsp; that Exhibits 2 and 3&nbsp; (J)&nbsp; totally&nbsp; repudiate plaintiff's claim that Tantoco is a party to&nbsp; the lease.</p><p>Exhibit 2, which is a receipt for the sum of P20,000 as advance payment of the rentals; shows that said amount was received from Amado C. Tamayo&nbsp; alone. Said receipt&nbsp; specifies&nbsp; certain conditions such as the period of the lease and the covenant that in the event of failure to pay&nbsp; the remaining rental of P180,000,&nbsp; the P20,000 received thereby would be forfeited by way of&nbsp; losses and damages. This Exhibit 2 bears the signature of Amado C. Tamayo <span style="font-style: italic;">personally</span> written below the words&nbsp; 'aking tinatanggap ang&nbsp; sinasabi sa itaas'. In this document&nbsp; Exhibit 2 the name of Cornelio&nbsp; Tantoco is&nbsp; conspicuous by its absence.&nbsp; He was not named here&nbsp; as&nbsp; Tamayo's principal or lessee or co-lessee.</p><p>Exhibit 3 Tamayo or Exhibit J, which is the&nbsp; receipt and provisional contract of lease executed on&nbsp; the 17th&nbsp; of&nbsp; October, 1944, is as&nbsp; illuminating.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contract recites&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff received from defendant Amado C. Tamayo the sum of&nbsp; P180,000 which completed the agreed rental of P200,000; that plaintiff has ceded, transferred and conveyed&nbsp; unto&nbsp; the said&nbsp; Araado C. Tamayo, his heirs and&nbsp; assigns,&nbsp; by way of lessee, the fishpond&nbsp; in question.&nbsp; Amado C. Tamayo&nbsp; for his part accepted the lease under the precise terms and&nbsp; conditions set forth&nbsp; therein and in the receipt of October 11, 1944, Exhibit 2.&nbsp; The document also stated that Amado&nbsp; C. Tamayo 'further manifests that he&nbsp; has inspected the property and that he obligates&nbsp; himself&nbsp; to return the possession of&nbsp; the&nbsp; same' to plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; As in Exhibit 2, the only contracting parties&nbsp; who appear&nbsp; in and&nbsp; signed&nbsp; the document Exhibit 3 were Vicente Valencia&nbsp; 'lessor', and&nbsp; Amado C. Tamayo, 'lessee'.&nbsp; Once again, no mention was made of defendant&nbsp; Cornelio&nbsp; Tantoco&nbsp; in&nbsp; Exhibit 3.&nbsp; When asked why he did not tell the notary to place the name of Tantoco in that document Exhibit&nbsp; 3, plaintiff simply stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; Tamayo had&nbsp; written authority to sign&nbsp; for Tantoco.&nbsp; tr. p.&nbsp; 247, and&nbsp; yet,&nbsp; Tamayo&nbsp; signed the document irt<span style="font-style: italic;"> propria persona.</span></p><p>Plaintiff and his&nbsp; son Mario&nbsp; Valencia&nbsp; in&nbsp; an effort&nbsp; to&nbsp; pin down defendant Tantoco, would further&nbsp; palm off&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; court the claim that it was said Tantoco who&nbsp; allegedly gave his son P25,000&nbsp; on the afternoon of the 11th of October, 1944.&nbsp;&nbsp; This obviously is not true. For, paragraph III&nbsp; of the original complaint, paragraph III of the first amended complaint and paragraph III&nbsp; of the&nbsp; second amended complaint, in&nbsp; unison, state&nbsp; that the sum of.P180,000—of which this P25,000 forms part—was delivered to plaintiff&nbsp; on October 17, 1944. Another proof that plaintiff's claim does not bear the usual earmarks of truth is the fact that although plaintiff and his own son Mario averred that a receipt was issued by the&nbsp; latter to Tantoco for the said sum of P25,000 the notices to produce Exhibits 4, 4-A, 4-B, and 4-C, issued&nbsp; by plaintiff's attorneys for the production of documents failed to mention&nbsp; that alleged receipt of KJ5,000 issued on October 11, 1944.&nbsp; Finally, plaintiff himself&nbsp; had&nbsp; to&nbsp; admit that there was no agreement as to the delivery of P25,000 on that same day, October&nbsp; 11, 1944. tr. pp. 263, 266.&nbsp; </p><p>Exhibits 2 and 3 uniformly speak of the contract of lease between plaintiff and Tamayo alone.&nbsp; This and the morass of contradiction into which&nbsp; plaintiff has&nbsp; involved himself and&nbsp; the complete unpredictability of plaintiff's&nbsp; theory,&nbsp; certainly will not&nbsp; permit&nbsp; this court to read into Exhibits 2 and&nbsp; 3 the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cornelio Tantoco&nbsp; as a party&nbsp; lessee.</p><p>Both&nbsp; Attorneys&nbsp; Santiago&nbsp; Macapagal&nbsp; who&nbsp; prepared Exhibit&nbsp; 2 and Alejandro de&nbsp; Santos who&nbsp; wrote Exhibit&nbsp; 3&nbsp; are&nbsp; practicing attorneys in the City of Manila.&nbsp; They are both alive.&nbsp; That plaintiff should prefer that this case be in umbilical dependence upon his sole testimony without the support of these two distinguished gentlemen, is proof enough that, if presented,&nbsp; the said attorneys would belie plaintiff's claim.</p><p>Needless&nbsp; to state, the proposed contract of lease Exhibit&nbsp; K&nbsp; is not&nbsp; binding upon&nbsp; Tantoco: <span style="font-style: italic;">First,</span> because it&nbsp; has not&nbsp; been signed by him; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Second,&nbsp;</span> because whatever Tamayo had stated at the back thereto,&nbsp; Exhibits&nbsp; K and K-l,&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; binding&nbsp; on&nbsp; Tantoco. At all events, the&nbsp; notations, Exhibits K and K-l, made by Tamayo do not afford&nbsp; as much as&nbsp; cold comfort to plaintiff's claim for Tamayo&nbsp; merely&nbsp; said&nbsp; there&nbsp; that&nbsp; he wanted to&nbsp; consult Tantoco and the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; interested in the&nbsp; partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp; This plainly implies that defendant Tantoco is&nbsp; not interested in&nbsp; the partnership&nbsp; and confirms&nbsp; what&nbsp; Tamayo statecl in&nbsp; court to&nbsp; the effect that he had&nbsp; to consult Dr. Tantoco—his&nbsp; consultant in&nbsp; fishpond deals—by reason of his&nbsp; (Tantoco's)&nbsp; experience in fishery&nbsp; business, tr. pp. 401, 402.</p><p>Upon all the foregoing, the court&nbsp; is fully convinced that plaintiff has no cause of&nbsp; action against&nbsp; defendant Cornelio Tantoco.</p><p>2. Is plaintiff entitled to recover that rentals sought in&nbsp; his complaint.</p><p>The quintessence of&nbsp; plaintiff's testimony is that the total sum&nbsp; of P200,000, consisting of P20,000 received by him under the terms&nbsp; of the&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; Exhibit 2 and P180,000 thereafter paid to him as shown in Exhibit J&nbsp; (or&nbsp; 3), was merely&nbsp; a deposit&nbsp; as security that&nbsp; he would receive the&nbsp; corresponding monthly&nbsp; rentals on the fishpond&nbsp; in question.</p><p>A&nbsp; cursory examination of the receipt Exhibit 2 dated October 11, 1944 will readily show that the&nbsp; sum of P20,000 received there under was an advance payment on account of rentals in the total amount of P200,000 for the lease of the fishpond from .November 15, 1944 to November&nbsp; 15, 1945.&nbsp; The following lifted from Exhibit 2 amply&nbsp; proves this fact:&nbsp; 'Tinanggap ko kay J. Amado C. Tamayo * * * ang halagang veinte mil pesos (P20,000)&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">bilang paunang bayad ng kabuuang buwis</span> na halagang P200,000 ng taking pinabubuwisang sa kanilang palaisdaan&nbsp; ko na&nbsp; nasa barrio&nbsp; Sta. Elena, Marulao, Hagunoy, Bulacan.'&nbsp; Said&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; 2&nbsp; Iikewise provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; the lease is for one year, so that&nbsp; the amount of P200,000 was the total rental&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">kabuuang&nbsp; buwis</span>) for&nbsp; the one-year period.&nbsp; In like manner, the third paragraph of&nbsp; Exhibit 2&nbsp; recites that the total rental of P200,000&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">kabuuan ng buwis</span>)&nbsp; was to be paid&nbsp; as&nbsp; follow:&nbsp; (a<span style="font-style: italic;">t ang pagbabayad ay gay a ng&nbsp; sumusunod</span>): P20,000 on that date, and the remaining P180,000 was&nbsp; to&nbsp; be paid (<span style="font-style: italic;">ay&nbsp; babayaran</span>) on October 19, 1944.&nbsp; Finally, the last&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; of&nbsp; Exhibit 2 states that in the event of the failure of Tamayo to pay the said amount of P180,000 (sakaling hindi&nbsp; mabayaran&nbsp; ang nasabing halagang P180,000) on the date aforementioned,&nbsp; the contract would be null and void and the sum of P20,000&nbsp; paid (<span style="font-style: italic;">na naibayad na</span>) would be forfeited to plaintiff as&nbsp; losses and damages.</p><p>As will be seen, the word 'deposit' or&nbsp; any&nbsp; other term of similar import&nbsp; is totally&nbsp; absent from&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The words utilized to express <span style="font-style: italic;">payment</span> of rentals are clear, the language plain and simple, and&nbsp; intention unmistakable.&nbsp; Plaintiff, a&nbsp; doctor of&nbsp; Medicine, is an intelligent businessman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhibit 2&nbsp; was prepared by&nbsp; an&nbsp; attorney of his&nbsp; own choice, Santiago&nbsp; Macapagal.&nbsp; The&nbsp; document was prepared&nbsp; by Atty. Macapagal after he had interviewed plaintiff&nbsp; and Tamayo, tr, pp. 237-238.&nbsp; It&nbsp; was read by&nbsp; Macapagal in plaintiff's; presence,&nbsp; tr. p. 242.&nbsp; Therefore, Exhibit&nbsp; 2 must be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; to represent the&nbsp; true intention of the parties.</p><p>But&nbsp; if&nbsp; the foregoing&nbsp; were&nbsp; not yet&nbsp; sufficient, there is Exhibit J (Exhibit 3) i the receipt&nbsp; and provisional&nbsp; contract of lease, a public document&nbsp; executed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the 17th day of&nbsp; October,&nbsp; 1944.&nbsp; The&nbsp; document written in English which&nbsp; is understood&nbsp; by&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; recites that 'I, Vicente&nbsp; Valencia * *&nbsp; * having received the further sum of one hundred eighty thousand&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; (P180,000)&nbsp; Philippine currency from Amado&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Tamayo * * * this&nbsp; 17th day of&nbsp; October,&nbsp; 1944 * * * which amount&nbsp; completed the&nbsp; agreed rental&nbsp; of&nbsp; P200.000 * * * does hereby cede,&nbsp; transfer and&nbsp; convey unto said Amado&nbsp; C.

Alejandro de Santos of the law firm oJt Francisco Delgado, counsel for plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Atty. De Santos prepared Exhibit J (Exhibit 3), so plaintiff&nbsp; himself admits, plaintiff and defendant Tamayo talked to Santos; they informed Santos about th contents of Exhibit 2 Tamayo,&nbsp; and of the terms and conditions of the present&nbsp; contract&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; J&nbsp; (Exhibit 3); and Santos&nbsp; understood the terms of the contract&nbsp; before&nbsp; the latter prepared&nbsp; Exhibit J (Exhibit 3)&nbsp; tr. pp.&nbsp; 251, 252, 270.</p><p>So&nbsp; clear&nbsp; indeed are the documents&nbsp; Exhibits&nbsp; 2 and&nbsp; 3 (J)&nbsp; that one&nbsp; unschooled in the ways of the law or&nbsp; another&nbsp; possessed&nbsp; of naivete will readily see that the&nbsp; sum of P200,000&nbsp; is in full payment of rentals—not deposit.</p><p>It&nbsp; has&nbsp; been held that a recital in a public document&nbsp; celebrated with&nbsp; all&nbsp; the&nbsp; legal formalities under the safeguard of a&nbsp; notarial certificate is&nbsp; 'evidence against&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties'&nbsp; and&nbsp; 'a high&nbsp; degree of proof is&nbsp; necessary to overcome&nbsp; the legal&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; that&nbsp; such recital&nbsp; is true.'&nbsp; (Naval <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.

Olviga, 60 Phil., 17, 21.</p><p>The&nbsp; court is not unmindful of the proposed&nbsp; contract&nbsp; Exhibit K drawn&nbsp; at plaintiff's behest by Atty. Santiago Macapagal who prepared Exhibit 2.&nbsp; At best it is self-serving.&nbsp; Defendants&nbsp; refused to sign&nbsp; it.&nbsp; That this proposal was an&nbsp; after thought is not&nbsp; difficult to realize.&nbsp; Mickey mouse money was already outlawed; plaintiff wanted to make&nbsp; sure that he get hold of Dr.&nbsp; Cornelio Tantoco&nbsp; and&nbsp; clamp not only upon Tamayo&nbsp; but also upon said Tantoco the payment of P110,000&nbsp; in genuine&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; currency by&nbsp; way&nbsp; of&nbsp; rentals&nbsp; from liberation up to the end of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it any wonder then that plaintiff&nbsp; should have eschewed Exhibits 2 and 3?</p><p>From another point of view, plaintiff's claim that he is entitled to collect rentals, month. by month,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the rate&nbsp; of P16,666.66 1/3&nbsp; in genuine&nbsp; money is at&nbsp; war with the facts.&nbsp; Lease of fisheries under the common&nbsp; practice&nbsp; is 'kung ano ang pasok ay siyang&nbsp; labas' that is, if the lease commences on November 30,&nbsp; it will end on November 30 of&nbsp; the succeeding year,&nbsp; a one-year period.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; never a contract of lease of fishponds&nbsp; on a&nbsp; month&nbsp; to month basis.&nbsp; Exhibits&nbsp; I; tr. pp.&nbsp; 403-404.&nbsp; That is why&nbsp; the lawyers who&nbsp; prepared Exhibits 2 and 3 (or J) <span style="font-style: italic;">did not</span> provide for the payments of rentals on monthly&nbsp; installments.</p><p>Plaintiff received&nbsp; the P200,000 in Japanese currency&nbsp; which was good at the time; and now he wants an additional P110,000&nbsp; in actual currency.&nbsp; 'No man may wrongfully (tertiously) enrich himself at the&nbsp; expense&nbsp; of (to the injury&nbsp; of)&nbsp; another.&nbsp;&nbsp; (E&nbsp; aun&nbsp; dixeron,&nbsp; que ningunono deue enriquesszer&nbsp; tertizeramente con&nbsp; dano&nbsp; de otro).

Santos, 34 Phil., 100, 116.</p><p>It would&nbsp; appear appropriate&nbsp; at this point to state that plaintiff gave cause for belief that he&nbsp; (plaintiff)&nbsp; is seized with that atavistic propensity to jump from one theory to another in the&nbsp; hope of obtaining beneficial results.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the suit covering a&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of the big fishpond in question, lot l-B-3 of the&nbsp; plan Exhibit D, he sustained the theory that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; a vendee in <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span>&nbsp; thereof. He lost in the Supreme Court.&nbsp; See Exhibit 7-Tamayo.&nbsp; Thereafter, he&nbsp; started&nbsp; land registration&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; covering the same&nbsp; land, lot l-B-3, and adopted an entirely different theory, to&nbsp; wit:&nbsp; that he&nbsp; was the exclusive owner&nbsp; of the property having inherited the same from his grandfather&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Crisostomo.&nbsp; And,&nbsp; he likewise lost in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan.&nbsp; Exhibit 8-Tamayo. This seemingly spineless pattern of behavior is once&nbsp; again apparent. in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present&nbsp; case.</p><p>The court, therefore, is constrained to state that it is not&nbsp; merely a matter&nbsp; of choice but of stern&nbsp; necessity that this court must withhold its stamp of approval on plaintiff's claim that the&nbsp; P200,000 received by him under Exhibits 2 and 3 (J)&nbsp; was in the&nbsp; form of deposit.&nbsp; The court finds, by overwhelming proof, that&nbsp; said sum of P200,000 was&nbsp; paid by way of rentals in advance for&nbsp; the one-year lease of the fishpond in question.</p><p>3. Plaintiff&nbsp; claims&nbsp; damages&nbsp; for defendants'&nbsp; failure&nbsp; to replace the bangus fry&nbsp; from which&nbsp; according to&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; he could&nbsp; have harvested fish at about P6,000.</p><p>Plaintiff's theory is that when defendant took possession&nbsp; of the fishpond there were about 3,700 <span style="font-style: italic;">bangus</span>&nbsp; seedlings, tr.&nbsp; pp. 181-182.. On this point there is no evidence but his sole uncorroborated testimony.</p><p>Oddly enough,&nbsp; the last time that plaintiff saw the&nbsp; fishpond before the liberation, was in August,&nbsp; 1944, that&nbsp; is, three months before defendant Tamayo took possession thereof, tr. pp. 211, 294.&nbsp; During the whole thne that defendant&nbsp; Tamayo was in possession, plaintiff never&nbsp; saw the&nbsp; fishpond personally, tr.&nbsp; 167. As a&nbsp; mater of&nbsp; fact, the fishpond was&nbsp; returned not&nbsp; to&nbsp; plaintiff but to Ciriaco Calayag,. the latter's encargado.</p><p>Damages&nbsp; must be proven even when not denied.&nbsp; Section 8,&nbsp; Rule</p><p>9.&nbsp; How could plaintiff know&nbsp; the amount of bangus seedlings which was in the fishpond when he was not present at the time of the&nbsp; delivery.&nbsp; How many of the fry&nbsp; would develop into&nbsp; marketable fish is not&nbsp; known.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; is there&nbsp; competent proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; prevailing price of hangus or bangus fry in Marulao,&nbsp; at the time of the surrender of the fishpond to plaintiff or at the&nbsp; time plaintiff could have harvested the fish following the return of the possession of the said fishpond. This court cannot predicate&nbsp; a finding of substantial damages upon conjecture or guess work.&nbsp; The amount claimed by&nbsp; plaintiff could be ascertained with reasonable accuracy. But he failed in this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff could Tiave placed on the stand his overseer Ciriaco Calayag, a competent witness who was taking care&nbsp; of the fish&nbsp; fry (tr. p. 211), but&nbsp; did&nbsp; not.&nbsp; A, stricter proof is required of him.

Plaintiff also claims damages suffered by the fishpond&nbsp; itself which allegedly was left unserviceable for the purpose.&nbsp; (Paragraph XIV,&nbsp; second amended&nbsp; complaint).</p><p>The utter lack of dependability in plaintiff's position is&nbsp; once more manifest in this&nbsp; cause of action." Plaintiff's theory in the first&nbsp; and second amended&nbsp; complaints is that the fishpond&nbsp; was abandoned by defendasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in Exhibits&nbsp; B-2, B-3, B-5 and C, which are documents prepared by plaintiff himself, plaintiff reneged on the theory that the fishpond was abandoned—he wrote therein that it&nbsp; was returned in a damaged condition.</p><p>Plaintiff&nbsp; admits&nbsp; that he did not&nbsp; know the condition of the fishpond when&nbsp; the same was left by the purchasers of the fish to&nbsp; whom he (plaintiff) sold the fish in said fishpond&nbsp; in September, 1944. re. pp.&nbsp; 235,&nbsp; 291.&nbsp; He did not know the condition of the fishpond&nbsp; on November 15, 1944, date&nbsp; of&nbsp; delivery,&nbsp; to Tamayo, because the&nbsp; last time he saw the said fishpond before liberation was in August, 1944. There is evidence to show that defendant&nbsp; Tamayo had to put&nbsp; the fishpond in&nbsp; shape before&nbsp; putting fish&nbsp; fry therein, tr. pp. 333-334, 365-366, 370, 397.</p><p>An examination of the receipts presented by plaintiff to prove that repairs were made on the fishpond before and after&nbsp; the lease, casts ;serious doubts as to their authenticity.&nbsp; Take&nbsp; for instance Exhibits H and H-l both thumbmarked by Francisco Salamat,&nbsp; for the sums of Pl,120 and P400 respectively.&nbsp; These two receipts bear the same date,&nbsp; July&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1944.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; H-2 for Pl,550 and Exhibit H-3 for P683 both thumbmarked by Jose de la Cruz and Francisco Salamat likewise bear one date, July 28, 1944.&nbsp;&nbsp; These last two receipts apparently were on sheets plucked from a composition book. Francisco Salamat, testifying in court, stated&nbsp; that&nbsp; after the foregoing receipts were thumbmarked by him, plaintiff Valencia&nbsp; just paid him the amounts therein, solely and exclusively upon his representation&nbsp; that he had done so much work.&nbsp; For, Valencia, never bothered to go to the fishpond, tr. p. 106.&nbsp; The court also examined the receipts&nbsp; Exhibits G, G-l, G-2, G-4 and G-5 dated&nbsp; respectively July&nbsp; 6,&nbsp; 1946,&nbsp; July 16,&nbsp; 1946, July&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1946,&nbsp; July 31,&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; and August&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; .1946.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; amounts&nbsp; in&nbsp; these&nbsp; receipts&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; paid without&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; intervention of&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Salamat,&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; overseer&nbsp; of plaintiff,&nbsp; and&nbsp; without&nbsp; plaintiff knowing personally&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of work done.&nbsp; Is it possible for plaintiff, a careful, intelligent man, to just give away money without tangible proof that work had&nbsp; been done? tr.&nbsp; pp. 57, 58 and 89.&nbsp; See also tr. pp. 297-298.&nbsp; The&nbsp; answer, most&nbsp; emphatically,&nbsp; is&nbsp; "No".</p><p>And then,&nbsp; the repairs extended from November, 1946&nbsp; {Exhibit D)&nbsp; to December,&nbsp; 1946 (Exhibit D-l).&nbsp; Between November&nbsp; 1945 and&nbsp; December,&nbsp; 1946,&nbsp; so many things could have&nbsp; happened,&nbsp; such as storms or floods which could have destroyed or damaged the fishpond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p><p>Turning to another&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; for&nbsp; repairs&nbsp; Exhibit M-l the court finds&nbsp; that in&nbsp; one&nbsp; single&nbsp; sheet&nbsp; three receipts&nbsp; widely&nbsp; varying&nbsp; in dates as follows, October 7, 1945, August 15,&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; and August 11, 1945 were successively written. This&nbsp; is irregular, to say the least.</p><p>The damages claimed, according to plaintiff, appear in the photographs Exhibts A&nbsp; to A-5.&nbsp; But Exhibits A-3, A-4&nbsp; and A-5&nbsp; refer to lot l-B-3&nbsp; which does not and did not belong to plaintiff, tr. pp. 281,&nbsp; 286.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is evidence to show that&nbsp; these photographs were taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; photographer&nbsp; Pablo Calayag n6t&nbsp; in November,&nbsp; 1945, shortly&nbsp; after the&nbsp; expiration&nbsp; of the lease, but in June, or&nbsp; July, 1946. tr.&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 322, 356.&nbsp; Referring&nbsp; now to&nbsp; the photograph&nbsp; Exhibit A-5,&nbsp; which&nbsp; purports&nbsp; to show the so-called&nbsp; 'balut' in&nbsp; lot&nbsp; l-B-3 (tr. p. 288), according to plaintiff's witness Francisco Salamat, there was no balut in August, 1944,&nbsp; as they cleaned&nbsp; the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; He added that balut would not&nbsp; grow&nbsp; in&nbsp; a year's time. tr. p. 122.&nbsp; If&nbsp; such is the case, why is it that&nbsp; there was balut in the fishpond according to Exhibit A—57.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; balut occupied an area of about ten&nbsp; hectares according to&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; tr. p.&nbsp; 187.&nbsp; It cannot&nbsp; be said&nbsp; that defendant Tamayo filled that extensive area only out of spite&nbsp; because plaintiff filed a suit against him.&nbsp; The fact is that that balut&nbsp; was there ever since before, tr. pp. 365, 371, 396.</p><p>Furthermore, Ciriaco Calayag, plaintiff's encargado, instruction of plaintiff&nbsp; and after going&nbsp; over&nbsp; and&nbsp; checking the fishpond&nbsp; in question, received the same&nbsp; in good order and condition, tr. pp.&nbsp; 340, 342.&nbsp; 350,&nbsp; 373-374.</p><p>Really,&nbsp; defendant Tamayo could&nbsp; not have harvested anything&nbsp; if the water gates and the pieces of wood&nbsp; for water gates were not in order and pilapiles were broken.&nbsp; Fish naturally&nbsp; would have escaped, tr. p. 335&nbsp; .It&nbsp; must be borne in&nbsp; mind that the last harvest made by defendant Tamayo was&nbsp; on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; 1945, and&nbsp; the fishpond was returned on November 10, 1945.&nbsp; Damages&nbsp; such&nbsp; as were described by plaintiff could not have occurred within so short an interval of time. tr. pp.&nbsp; 338, 395.</p><p>There is&nbsp; information to the&nbsp; effect that&nbsp; Ciriaco Calayag&nbsp; is still alive, tr. 347.&nbsp; Yet plaintiff did not&nbsp; present&nbsp; Calayag, his overseer, as a witness. No reason&nbsp; was advanced for non-presentation. The&nbsp; presumption&nbsp; is that&nbsp; if presented Ciriaco&nbsp; Calayag&nbsp; would&nbsp; not support plaintiff's claim. Section 69 (e), Rule 123.</p><p>The court accordingly is of the opinion and so holds that plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages arising out of the alleged damaged condition of the fishpond&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the termination of&nbsp; the lease. In view of all the foregoing,&nbsp; the court concludes that&nbsp; plaintiff is entitled to&nbsp; take nothing by his complaint.</p><p>No evidence was presented to support the counterclaims. Wherefore, this case, in all&nbsp; its parts, is hereby&nbsp; dismissed, with costs against plaintiff."</p></blockquote><p>As to the eleventh assignment of error to the effect that the&nbsp; court&nbsp; erred in&nbsp; denying plaintiff's&nbsp; motion for new trial, dated September 3,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; We likewise find&nbsp; that no such error was committed, for the evidence to be introduced by the&nbsp; appellant,&nbsp; if new&nbsp; trial had been granted, was not a newly&nbsp; discovered evidence&nbsp; but one which existed at&nbsp; the time of the trial,&nbsp; although, according to the&nbsp; appellant, he could&nbsp; not present&nbsp; it because during the&nbsp; trial of&nbsp; the case the&nbsp; residence of Ciriaco Calayag&nbsp; was not&nbsp; known. We also find that, had the&nbsp; court permitted the&nbsp; new trial, the testimony of Ciriaco Calayag&nbsp; would be&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect that the defendants did not deliver to him,&nbsp; as&nbsp; encargado of the plaintiff, the fishpond in question in good condition; but this testimony, even admitted,&nbsp; would not be sufficient to alter the findings of&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court regarding delivery of the fishpond in question to the defendant, which are fully supported by&nbsp; the evidence of record.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; has&nbsp; been, therefore, no substantial prejudice&nbsp; to the appellant by the denial&nbsp; of his motion for new trial which&nbsp; may constitute reversible error.</p><p>Again, as to Annex B of the motion for new trial, consisting of a decision of&nbsp; the Court of Appeals reversing a decision of the Court of First Instance of Bulacan, which was invoked as a ground for new trial, We find said decision of the Court of Appeals not to have much bearing on the principal question&nbsp; involved in this case and therefore its&nbsp; rejection does not likewise&nbsp; constitute&nbsp; reversible error. Wherefore, finding no error in the decision appealed from, the same is hereby affirmed, without pronouncement with regard to costs.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
