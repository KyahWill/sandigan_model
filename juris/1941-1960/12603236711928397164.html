				G.R. No. L-5631, April 27, 1954</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FELIX GARCIA Y FULGENCIO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The defendant Felix Garcia y Fulgencio was charged in the Court of
First Instance of Manila with having sold tickets for "Have" races of
the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes, in violation of Act 4130, as
amended by Commonwealth Act No. 301. Upon arraignment on March 17,
1952, he entered a plea of guilty; whereupon the court rendered a
decision finding him guilty as charged, and sentencing him to undergo
one month of imprisonment, with the accessories of the law, and to pay
the costs. The defendant has appealed, contending that the lower court
erred (1) in entering a plea of guilty, and (2) in rendering judgment
under an information that charges no offense.
<p>The second assignment of error, with which the Solicitor-General
agrees, being well-taken, there is no need of passing upon the first.
The pertinent provision of Act No. 4130, as amended by Commonwealth Act
No. 301, penalizes with imprisonment for not less than one month nor
more than three years, any person who, without being a duly authorized
agent of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes, sells tickets of said
corporation or, being such agent, sells tickets, fractions or coupons
thereof not issued by the corporation, representing or tending to
represent an interest in tickets issued by the corporation.</p>
<p>The appellant is accused of selling tickets for "have" races of the
Philippine Charity Sweepstakes which are different from and not tickets
issued by said corporation, or tickets not issued by it representing or
tending to represent an interest in tickets issued by said corporation.
The law relied upon does not include "Have" tickets for Sweepstakes
races. Neither was there any other statute that prohibited and punished
the act imputed to the appellant.</p>
<p>The decision appealed from is, therefore, hereby reversed and the information dismissed. So ordered without costs.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,</em> and <em>Concepcion, JJ., </em>concur.</p>
