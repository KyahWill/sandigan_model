				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal involves another <em>pacto de retro</em> document allegedly 
concealing a real estate mortgage. Many similar disputes have heretofore passed 
the judicial mill, the issues having become somewhat commonplace. It is a 
tribute to their patience that judges do not, in utter weariness refuse to 
discover the concealed pact behind the written document, holding the parties to 
what they have signed <em>scienti et volenti</em>, and thereby reducing the 
number of lawsuits. 
<p>The record discloses that on March 31, 1941, the following document (Exhibit 
A) was notarized by Carlos M. Sison and Pilar Balmori on behalf of her father 
Joaquin Balmori (immaterial parts omitted): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This agreement, made and executed this 31st day of March, 1941 by and 
between Carlos M. Sison, of legal age, married to Priscila de la Fuente, and 
resident of 1298 Pennsylvania, 4 Int., City of Manila, hereinafter to be called 
the VENDEE, and Pilar Balmori, of age, single, Filipino, and resident of 131 
Alhambra, Eraita, Manila, acting in representation of Don Joaquin Balmori by 
virtue of a general power of attorney executed in her favor by the latter on 
June 29, 1935 empowering her to sell, lease, and otherwise encumber his real 
estate properties * * *</p>
<p>"That Don Joaquin Balmori is the absolute owner of two parcels of land with a 
house of strong materials standing thereon, his title thereto being evidenced by 
Certificate of Title No. 23920 and Certificate of Title No. 23923 issued by the 
Register of Deeds of the City of Manila, said lot and house being situated in 
Calle Alhambra No. 131, Ermita, Manila, and bounded and described as follows: 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="center">" *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * "</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That for and in consideration of the sum of eight thousand pesos (P18,000) 
the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, by the VENDOR in her 
above-mentioned capacity, the said VENDOR hereby sell, cedes and transfers the 
properties herein described, included the house of strong materials located 
thereon, to the said VENDEE, his heirs, adminstrators, executors and subject to 
the conditions herein below set forth: </p>
<p>"(1) That the VENDOR reserves the right to repurchase from the VENDEE the 
property herein described within a period of five years from the time this 
contract is consummated by paying to the said VENDEE the purchase price stated 
herein.</p>
<p>"(2) That pending the repurchase by the VENDOR, the said VENDOR, with her 
immediate family, shall have the right to lease from the VENDEE the pr operty 
herein described by paying a monthly rent of one hundred fifty pesos (P150.00) 
payable at the law office of the VENDEE located at 340 Regina Building within 
the first twenty-five days of the month that it falls due; provided, further, 
that in the event that the VENDOR shall sublet the place to anybody else, the 
written consent of the VENDEE shall first be secured; </p>
<p>"(3) That the VENDOR shall have the right to accumulate the maximum of four 
months rent; provided, however, that the VENDEE shall also have the right to 
refuse the payment of the current rent if the back rent or rents, including the 
current rent, is not paid. </p>
<p>"(4) That the VENDOR shall insure in the name of the VENDEE who shall have 
the right to collect the amount for which the house is insured in the event of 
fire, the house located in the properties herein described against fire in the

to the VENDEE, who shall be responsible for its payment to the Insurance Company 
five days before the expiration of the contract of insurance. </p>
<p>"(5) That the vendor shall pay any and all taxes that may be levied on the 
property herein described by delivering the amount or amounts to the VENDEE, who

<p>"(7) That any violation on the part of the VENDOR of any of the 
above-mentioned conditions or failure on the part of said VENDOR to pay five 
months consecutive rent shall forfeit her right to repurchase the property 
herein described and the VENDEE shall become the absolute owner thereof." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is undisputed that on the above-mentioned day Pilar Balmori received from 
Carlos M. Sison the sum of P18,000. </p>
<p>Thereafter the Balmori family continued occupying the house until June 30, 
1942 when Sison recovered possession thereof by virtue of a complaint he had 
filed in the Municipal Court of Manila for nonpayment of the stipulated rents 
from November, 1941 to June 3, 1942. </p>
<p>On December 2, 1942, Carlos M. Sison consolidated his title to the property 
on the ground of the vendor's breach of the terms of the lease i. e. failure to 
pay rents for five months. He obtained from the Register of Deeds new 
certificates of title. </p>
<p>Subsequently, in March, 1943, the Balmoris, through Rosario Vda. de Balmori, 
moved to repurchase the property, offering Carlos K. Sison the sum of P26,500. 
(Joaquin Balmori had died in December, 1941). He declined, however, saying they 
had forfeited their right to repurchase through their failure to pay rents for 
more than seven months. </p>
<p>Wherefore, on April 14, 1943, the plaintiffs, the only legal heirs of Joaquin 
Balmori (his widow and children) instituted these proceedings in the Manila 
court to obtain relief, advancing the theory that their transaction with Sison 
was a loan of money secured by realty, and not a sale with the right to 
repurchase. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, on April 8, 1943, Carlos M. Sison sold the property to his brother 
Juan A. Sison for the sum of P27,000.00 by means of a document that was 
immediately recorded in the Registry of Deeds. Branding this as a fictitious 
conveyance plaintiffs included Juan A. Sison as defendant for the corresponding 
remedies against him. </p>
<p>After hearing the parties and their evidence, the trial court rendered 
judgment holding that their contract was a mere mortgage and "declaring the 
defendant Carlos M. Sison creditor of plaintiff's predecessor, in the sum of 
P20,000, with 10 per cent interest per annum; ordering Carlos M. Sison to accept 
from the plaintiffs the sum of P20,000, plus the corresponding interests, in 
payment of this indebtedness; declaring the deed of sale between Carlos M. Sison 
and Juan A. Sison (Exhibit 6) null and void; and ordering the Register of Deeds 
to cancel Transfer Certificates of Title issued in the name of Juan A. Sison by 
virtue of said exhibit 6 and to issue other ones in favor of the heirs of 
Joaquin Balmori". </p>
<p>This main issue has been thoroughly discussed in the briefs of both sides. 
The nature of the agreement is mostly a question of fact. The plaintiffs' story 
is that "sometime prior to March 31, 1941, Joaquin Balmori,* * * who was then 
very ill, was in need of money, but as he could not go out of his bed to make 
the necessary negotiations, he executed a power of attorney in favor of his 
daughter, Pilar Balmori, authorizing the latter to negotiate a loan using the 
above-mentioned property as security. Pilar Balmori, acting upon the information 
given by her brother-in-law, Pelagio Villegas, approached Carlos M. Sison and 
solicited from him a loan of P20,000 to be guaranteed by the above-mentioned 
property. Carlos M. Sison, after inspecting the proposed security with his 
brother, Juan A. Sison, an engineer, agreed to extend a loan of P18,000, to be 
increased later to P20,000 payable within five years from said date, with 
interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent per annum, payable at the rate of 
P150 a month. In addition, however, he required the borrower to pay a supposed 
commission to him of 4 per cent in connection with the grant of the loan. 
Evidently, he intended to give this amount to his brother Juan as compensation 
for the latter's above technical services. On March 31, 1941 Carlos asked Pilar 
to sign the corresponding document. Pilar immediately noticed that the document 
was in the form of a 'pacto de retro' sale. Carlos, however, assured her that it 
would be, in essence, the same as a mortgage and that she need have no fear 
whatever of losing the property in the event they should fail to pay the 
proposed rent for five consecutive months, because he (Carlos) would not take 
advantage of such a default. In view of these assurances, and considering that 
they were then hard pressed for money, Pilar signed the document identified in 
the records as exhibit A. Thereupon, Carlos advanced the loan after deducting 
P100 as attorney's fees to himself and P720 as commission to himself of which 
the sum of P700, according to Carlos, was given to his brother Juan, as 
above-mentioned. </p>
<p>"On July 21, 1941, Carlos M. Sison extended the additional loan of P2,000 to 
Joaquin Balmori, still represented by Pilar Balmori, but Carlos M. Sison caused 
to be prepared and executed Exhibit 2, which purports to be a mortgage in favor 
of Juan A. Sison of Joaquin Balmori's right to repurchase the above properties. 
This latter loan was payable within five years, at 10 per cent per annum, 
payable monthly. On the same date, July 21, 1941, the sum of P45O was paid to 
Carlos in full payment of the so-called rent on exhibit A for the months of May, 
June and July at the rate of P150 per month (exhibit 3). Again, on December 25, 
1941, there was paid to Carlos the sum of P499.98 allegedly 'in full payment of 
the rent of the property in question corresponding to August, September and 
October, 1941' at the rate of P166.66 per month (exhibit 1). The difference of 
P16.66 in the monthly rental represented the 'interest' on the additional loan 
of P2,000." </p>
<p>On the other hand, Carlos M. Sison, the defendant, swore that "several days 
before March 31, 1941, my brother approached me and proposed that I invest some 
money on the Balmori property. He told me of the advantages of the investment, 
it is on the boulevard, of strong materials, well located. The Balmoris wanted a 
mortgage on the property, but I told him I do not want to enter into a mortgage 
contract for it involved a lot of things, foreclosure, the 90-day period, 
computation of interest. I told him I would give P18,000 provided we enter into 
a <em>Pacto de Retro</em> sale and in order not to have their father vacate the 
premises, he is so sick, I am going to make him a tenant at P150.00 a month All 
these facts were made very clear to Pilar Balmori, that she was entering into a 
contract of <em>pacto de retro</em> sale and as a matter of fact this contract, 
Exhibit A, was copied from a decision of the Supreme Court which states that it 
is a <em>pacto de retro</em> sale. And I told them that although a contract of 
<em>pacto de retro</em> sale is quite different from a mortgage, I am going to 
give them a lee-way of five months before starting ejecting them and they all 
consented". </p>
<p>Without explaining why he doubted the personal credibility of defendant 
Carlos M. Sison, whose version tallies with the words and phrases of the 
document evidencing the transaction, the trial judge opined that the parties had 
concluded a loan, because of "their conduct and the negotiations that took place 
prior to March 31, 1941" and because (1) the vendor remained in possession of 
the property sold paying rents of P150.00 a month which is exactly 10 per cent 
of P18,000 and (2) because the document "contains provisions such as the payment 
of land taxes, insurance premiums and costs of repairs by the vendor-lessee". 
</p>
<p>By "conduct of the parties" the court obviously alluded to, and believed, the 
plaintiffs' testimony that Joaquin Balmori had authorized his daughter Pilar to 
borrow money, that she approached Sison for a loan and that he agreed to the 
request provided the transaction be evidenced by a deed of the tenor of Exhibit 
A. Yet it clearly appears that Pilar was authorized by her father <em>not 
only</em> to borrow on that property, <em>but also to sell</em> it. (See the 
power of attorney). </p>
<p>And contrary to the court's opinion, the circumstance that the vendor 
retained possession as lessee is perfectly compatible with a true <em>pacto de 
retro </em>sale<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>. So are the stipulations 
about payment by the lessee or vendor of land taxes, insurance, premiums, 
etc.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span> And the clause establishing 
forfeiture of the right of redemption is valid. (Vitug <em>vs</em>. Coronel, 40 
Phil. 686. See also El Hogar Filipino <em>vs</em>. Paredes, 45 Phil. 178.) </p>
<p>On the other hand, Carlos M. Sison had no motive to camouflage a mortgage 
with the habiliments of a pacto de retro. There was no usury, as the trial court 
found. Even supposing that in addition to the rents (10%) the "borrower" paid 4 
per cent as commission or interest, inasmuch as the "loan" was for five years 
the 4per cent commission would hardly make a one per cent addition to the yearly 
interest (10%). Eleven per cent per annum is not usurious. </p>
<p>Wherefore, it is quite unlikely that Sison should plan a concealment. It is 
very probable that, as he asserted under oath, he eschewed a mortgage, for the 
troublesome foreclosure proceedings. He wanted a sale, reserving to the Balmoris 
the privilege to repurchase. This arrangement must have been acceptable to the 
Balmoris. It gave both parties what they ultimately desired. To the Balmoris, 
P18,OOO which they could "return" by repurchasing their property within five 
years. To Sison, the property itself, if the Balmoris failed to repurchase it. 
No foreclosure difficulties. Extremely remarkable is the absence of any evidence 
that the property's value was much greater. Striving to overcome the tenor of 
the instrument, plaintiffs should have established that point, to show the 
unlikelihood that the Balmoris would have consented to a sale with <em>pacto de 
retro</em>. Indeed, there is indirect proof that the assessed value was P17,222. 
(Exhibit 11). </p>
<p>Proof positive that there was actually a sale is the fact that when in 1942 
Sison sought to recover possession of the premises by a court proceedings, and 
when he consolidated his title thereto not a single voice was raised to claim 
that the contract was a mortgage. </p>
<p>It was only in 1943, when realty prices in Manila began to rise, that 
plaintiffs thought of repurchasing the property, and failing in the attempt, 
they suddenly remembered the rights of a mortgage. Those who have unadvisedly 
sold lands that subsequently increased in value know the frequent and powerful 
temptations to exaggerate or minimize details supporting any theory that would 
enable them to reclaim their former possessions, specially recalling our 
doctrines that oral evidence may be introduced, under certain circumstances, to 
alter or contradict the terms of a written instrument , and that contracts of 
<em>pacto de retro</em> being disfavored, documents of such nature will not be 
upheld as sales, but as loans, when there is something in their language or in 
the conduct of the parties which clearly shows .that they intended a mortgage — 
not a sale. Certainly, there is no purpose to discard those views now.</p>
<p>However, the document here in question is plain. There is nothing in its 
language to engender the suspicion that it meant other things. It is exactly the 
form of instrument which was declared a pacto de retro sale in Tolentino vs. Sy 
Chiam, <em>supra</em>. Indeed, Carlos M. Sison, a lawyer by profession, swore 
before the court that Exhibit A was modelled after the contract in that case. 
</p>
<p>And what about the conduct of the parties? Except for what Pilar Balmori 
declared, no act of the plaintiffs before this litigation had in any way given 
indication of a contract of mortgage. On the contrary, their silent acquiescence 
in the ouster, and in the consolidation of ownership, is corroborative of that 
transfer of dominion differentiating a mortgage from a sale. And the subsequent 
act of Pilar Balmori in mortgaging <em>their right of redemption</em> to Juan A. 
Sison is added indication that there was a veritable sale with <em>pacto de 
retro</em>. True, it is reported that this mortgage was a part of the original 
scheme of Carlos M. Sison to disguise the mortgage. But this is improbable, 
because seven months had lapsed between the original <em>pacto de retro</em> 
sale and the subsequent mortgage, and it is inconceivable that Pilar Balmori 
could again be "forced" to sign a document that misrepresented the agreement, 
relieved as her family was, of the pressing financial necessity that compelled 
her in the first instance to acquiesce in Exhibit A. </p>
<p>To cap it all, the herein plaintiffs about March, 1943 attempted to buy back 
the property, offering Carlos M. Sison the sum of P26,500. A slip that gave 
plaintiffs away, this is conclusive admission that Carlos M. Sison had become 
the owner, through the <em>pacto de retro</em> sale and his consolidation of 
title. This distinctive, persuasive feature is not to be found in the cases 
brought to our attention holding <em>pacto de retro</em> documents as mere 
mortgages. </p>
<p>In Gatmaitan <em>vs</em>. Nepomuceno, 42 Phil. 295, we reversed the trial 
judge's finding that a <em>pacto de retro</em> document executed by Nicolas 
Espinosa was a mortgage. This conclusion was prompted by the clear provisions of 
the power of attorney given to Espinosa empowering him to sell, plus the 
stipulations in the document which were plainly those of a <em>pacto de 
retro</em> sale. This Court found error in the acceptance of the "self-serving 
declaration" of one of plaintiffs that they had understood the transaction to be 
a mortgage. In that case we made these pronouncements: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are not unmindful of the fact that sales with pacto de retro are not 
favored, and that the court will not construe an instrument to be one of sale 
con <em>pacto de retro</em>, with the stringent and onerous effects which follow 
unless the terms of the document and the surrounding circumstances require it. 
(Padilla <em>vs</em>. Linsangan, 19 Phil., 65, 68; Olino <em>vs</em>. Medina, 13 
Phil., 379.) In consonance with this doctrine, we, have also decided that 'parol 
evidence is competent and admissible in support of allegations that an 
instrument in writing, purporting on its face to transfer the absolute title to 
property, or to transfer the title with a mere right of repurchase, was in truth 
and in fact given merely as security for the repayment of a loan.1 (Cuyugan 
<em>vs</em>. Santos, 34 Phil., 100; Rodriguez <em>vs</em>. Pamintuan and De 
Jesus, 37 Phil., 876; Cuyugan <em>vs</em>. Santos, 39 Phil., 970.) </p>
<p>"In the present case, however, the terms of the contract entered into between 
the parties clearly show that the transfer of the land in question by the 
plaintiffs to the defendant was in the nature of a sale with <em>pacto de 
retro</em>, and the plaintiffs have shown no circumstances whatever which would 
justify us in construing the said contract to be a mere loan with guaranty. </p>
<p>"In every case in which we have construed a contract to be a mortgage or a 
loan with guaranty instead of a sale with <em>pacto de retro</em>, we have done 
so either because the terms of such contract are ambiguous (i. e., capable of 
being interpreted either as a loan with guaranty or a sale with <em>pacto de 
retro</em>), or because the circumstances surrounding the execution or the 
performance of the contract were incompatible or inconsistent with the theory 
that said contract was one of purchase and sale. (<em>See</em> Olino 
<em>vs</em>. Medina, 13 Phil., 379.) In the case of Padilla <em>vs</em>. 
Linsangan (19 Phil., 65, 66), the term employed in the contract to indicate the 
nature of the conveyance of land was '<em>pledged</em>' instead of 
'<em>sold</em>'. In the case of Manlangit <em>vs</em>. Sanchez Dy Puico (34 
Phil., 325), while the obligor used the terms 'sell and transfer with a right to 
repurchase', yet in said contract he described himself as a 'debtor', the 
obligee as a 'creditor', and the contract as a 'mortgage'. In the case of 
Rodriguez vs. Pamintuan and De Jesus (37 Phil., 876), the person who executed 
the instrument purporting on its face to be a deed of sale of certain parcels of 
land, had merely acted under a power of attorney from the owner of said land, 
'authorizing him to borrow money in such amount and upon such terms and 
conditions as he might deem proper, and to secure payment of the loan by a 
mortgage' on said lands. In the case of Villa <em>vs</em>. Santiago (38 Phil., 
157, 161), although a contract purporting to be a deed of sale was executed, the 
supposed vendor remained in possession of the land and invested the money he had 
obtained from the supposed vendee in making improvements thereon; the value of 
the land was more than P10,000, whereas the money borrowed was only P2,300; and 
there were other circumstances connected with the conduct of the plaintiff (the 
supposed vendee) which justified the court in holding that the transaction was a 
mere loan. In the case of Cuyugan <em>vs</em>. Santos (34 Phil., 100), the 
purchaser accepted partial payments from the vendor, and such acceptance of 
partial payments 'is absolutely incompatible with, the idea of irrevocability of 
the title of ownership of the purchaser at the expiration of the term stipulated 
in the original contract for the exercise of the right of repurchase' ." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Pilar Balmori, we are told, knew at the time she signed Exhibit A that it was 
a <em>pacto de retro</em> sale, entirely different from a mortgage. We may 
gather that at that time, or subsequently thereto, the certificates of title 
were delivered to Carlos M. Sison. (Otherwise he could not have obtained new 
certificates of title). It is therefore quite probable that a <em>pacto de 
retro</em> sale was really intended (cf. Arevalo <em>vs</em>. Dimayuga, 49 Phil. 
894 at p. 900). </p>
<p>Wherefore, fully persuaded that Sison and Balmori had really agreed to a sale 
with <em>pacto de retro</em>, we deem it unnecessary to pass on the validity of 
the conveyance to Juan A. Sison and the other incidental issues in the 
controversy. The defense that defendants were excused from the violation of the 
contract of lease because of the Japanese occupation, is precluded by the final 
judgment revoking the lease in 1942 and restoring possession to Carlos M. Sison. 
</p>
<p>The defendants are absolved from the complaint, with costs against the 
appellees. </p><em>Feria, Pablo,</em> and <em>Padilla, JJ.,</em> concur.
