				G.R. No. L-9725, October 18, 1955</h4>
				<H3>FLORA CADIMAS, PETITIONER, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.B.L., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">It appearing that petitioner's husband, Donato Cachola, is at present a 
prisoner at the Iwahig Penal Colony, under the control of respondent Director of 
Prisons, pursuant to a final decision of the Court of First Instance of Ilocos 
Sur dated January 18, 1955, sentencing him to five (5) years imprisonment and a 
fine of P1,000, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, for the 
crime of illegal possession of military ammunition (hand grenade), committed on 
or about March 16, 1951, allegedly in violation of Republic Act No. 4;
<p>Considering that in March of 1951, such unlicensed possession of firearms or 
ammunitions was not unlawful, for the reason that Republic Act No. 482 had 
extended the period for the surrender of unlicensed arms and ammunition to June 
10, 1951; that during the extended period, only making <em>use</em> thereof, or 
carrying them <em>on the person</em> of the possessor, was made punishable; and 
neither of these acts was attributed to the accused Donato Cachola;</p>
<p>Considering, further, that while Donato Cachola pleaded guilty to the 
information, such plea, as pointed out in the return of the Solicitor General, 
constituted only an admission of the facts alleged in the information, but was 
not an admission that the acts charged were unlawful, nor did it have the effect 
of curing the defect in the Court's juridiction (People <em>vs</em>. Santos 
Lopez, 45 Off. Gaz., [No. 5] 2089);</p>
<p>Considering that the information against Donato Cachola did not charge any 
crime, and therefore, his conviction was void;</p>
<p>The writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> prayed for is granted, and in view of the 
admitted facts, the prisoner Donato Cachola is ordered released from custody. 
Without costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
