				<H3>CECILIO BUENAVENTURA, PETITIONER, VS. EMILIO PEÑA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioner, Cecilio Buenaventura, is the plaintiff in civil case No. 971 
of the Court of First Instance of Manila, wherein he sought to obtain a judicial 
declaration upholding his right over the occupancy and lease of stalls Nos. 1162 
and 1495 of the Quinta Market, and an order restraining the defendants therein 
from ousting him from said market stalls. A writ of preliminary injunction was 
issued by the respondent Judge, Hon. Emilio Peña, directed against Mayor 
Valeriano Fugoso and his co-defendants. After trial, said respondent Judge 
rendered a decision declaring the respondent Domingo Coquiat to be the lawful 
occupant of the stalls in question, and setting aside the writ of preliminary 
injunction aforementioned. From this decision the petitioner has appealed, but 
prior to the expiration of the period for appeal, the respondent Domingo 
Coquiat, one of the defendants in civil case No. 971, filed an urgent motion for 
execution based mainly on the following grounds:
<blockquote>
<p>"It is to be remembered that Domingo Coquiat has long been deprived of the 
occupancy of Market Stalls Nos. 1162 and 1495, Quinta Market, Manila, 
consequently depriving, him for so long a time of the only means of support for 
himself and his family. Each day of delay in the execution of the judgment means 
a corresponding day of difficulty on his part and that of his family in 
procuring the necessary provision for their support. Aside from the fact that 
plaintiff has several other stalls in the Quinta Market, Manila, besides the two 
stalls in question that he is illegally occupying he has already profited so 
much from the said market stalls in question at the expense of the defendant 
Domingo Coquiat, the lawful occupant of the same. Nobody should be allowed to 
enrich himself at the expense of another."</p></blockquote>
<p>This motion was granted by the respondent judge, and the order to that effect 
was entered at the foot of the second page of said motion.</p>
<p>In the present petition for certiorari, the petitioner contends that the 
order of the respondent judge directing immediate execution of his decision in 
civil case No. 971 constitutes a grave abuse of discretion on his part, there 
being no good reasons therefor.</p>
<p>Under section 2 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the trial court may, in its 
discretion, order execution before the expiration of the time to appeal, upon 
good reasons to be stated in a special order. The sufficiency of the reasons for 
ordering such execution is naturally to be determined by said court; and we will 
not substitute our own way of thinking for that of the trial court with 
reference to such matters, if its discretionary power is to have any 
meaning.</p>
<p>Of course, interference by this Court may be in order, if it be shown that 
there has been an abuse of discretion or that "since the issuance of the order, 
conditions have so far changed as to necessitate the intervention of the 
appellate court to protect the interests of the parties against contingencies 
which were not, or could not have been, contemplated by the trial judge at the 
time of the issuance of the order." (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 
1, 2d ed., p. 644, citing Calvo <i>vs</i>. De Gutierrez, 4 Phil., 203; Case 
<i>vs</i>. Metropole Hotel and Restaurant, 5 Phil., 49; Gamay <i>vs</i>. 
Gutierrez David, 48 Phil., 768.) In the case at bar, however, we cannot hold 
that the fact that the respondent Domingo Coquiat has long been deprived of the 
possession of the market stalls awarded to him by the decision in civil case No. 
971, and the consequent loss on his part of the benefits that should daily 
accrue to him by occupying said stalls, are reasons not good enough for ordering 
immediate execution. And the cogency of such reasons are not affected by the 
lack of any finding in the decision in said case as to damages.</p>
<p>There is another ground making the present petition untenable. The decision 
in civil case No. 971 set aside the writ of preliminary injunction issued at its 
commencement. Under section 4 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, unless otherwise 
ordered by the trial court, a judgment dissolving or denying an injunction shall 
not be stayed after its rendition and before an appeal is taken or during the 
pendency of an appeal, although said court, in its discretion, may restore such 
injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such terms as to bond or 
otherwise as it may consider proper for the security of the rights of the 
adverse party. In the instant case, the respondent judge not only did not 
restore the writ of preliminary injunction dissolved in his decision, but 
expressly ordered its execution and refused to allow the herein petitioner to 
file a supersedeas bond. In the absence of such injunction, the defendant City 
officials in civil case No. 971 could have proceeded with the ouster of the 
petitioner from the stalls in question. Indeed, there is really nothing to be 
executed under the decision which merely determined who has a better title to 
said stalls; and the order of the respondent judge now complained of, can only 
be interpreted to mean as an authorization for the City authorities to carry 
out, with the aid of the sheriff, the said ouster.</p>
<p>The petition is hereby dismissed, and writ of preliminary injunction 
heretofore issued accordingly dissolved. So ordered, with costs against the 
petitioner.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Feria, Pablo, Hilado, Bengzon, Hontiveros, 
Padilla,</i> and <i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>Petitioner filed a complaint against the Mayor of Manila and other city 
officers to restrain them from ousting plaintiff from stalls 1162 and 1495 in 
the Quinta Market. The complaint is dated October 18, 1946. Domingo Coquiat 
filed an answer claiming to be the rightful occupant of said stalls. The other 
defendants filed an answer praying for the dismissal of the complaint On January 
30, 1947, respondent judge rendered decision declaring Coquiat the lawful 
occupant of the stalls, with costs against the plaintiff.</p>
<p>On February 12, 1947, Coquiat moved for the execution of the judgment "by 
authorizing the sheriff of Manila to eject Cecilio Buenaventura and his 
representatives from market stalls Nos. 1162 and 1495, Quinta Market, Manila, in 
order that Domingo Coquiat can immediately occupy" them. Plaintiff filed an 
opposition to said motion on February 20, 1947. Respondent judge issued an order 
of execution addressed to the sheriff of Manila to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Now, therefore, we command you to cause the plaintiff Cecilio Buenaventura 
to forthwith vacate the stalls Nos. 1162 and 1495 of the Quinta Market, Manila, 
and that defendant Domingo Coquiat have restitution of the 
same."</p></blockquote>
<p>The above writ was issued upon respondent judge's order of February 21, 1947, 
consisting of two words, "Motion granted," written in the second page of the 
motion for execution filed on February 12, 1947.</p>
<p>The power of the lower court to order execution of judgment before the 
expiration of the time to appeal is regulated by section 2 of Rule 39, where it 
is provided that execution may be issued "upon good reasons to be stated in a 
special order."</p>
<p>This provision appears to have been violated as in the two words "Motion 
granted" written by respondent judge there is no reason stated at all, whether 
good or bad, in support of the issuance of execution.</p>This clear violation of 
law is more than enough ground why said order should be set aside, and so we 
vote.</div>
