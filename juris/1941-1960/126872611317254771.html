				<H3>AMADO BUENAVENTURA, PETITIONER, VS. EULALIO GARCIA, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, AND BASILIO GARCIA, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner asks that the respondent judge of first instance of Rizal be 
commanded to issue an order for the execution of the judgment of that court in 
civil case No. R-7848, entitled "Basilio Garcia <i>vs</i>. Amado 
Buenaventura."
<p>It appears that on January 7, 1946, the herein petitioner filed, in the Rizal 
court, a motion for the reconstitution of the record of the said litigation 
alleging, among other things, that the papers had been destroyed during the war, 
that decision of the case had been rendered by the Rizal court on November 21, 
1941; that the appeal therefrom had been dismissed by the Court of Appeals; that 
such dismissal had been affirmed by the Supreme Court sometime in July, 1944, 
and that subsequently the <i>expediente</i> had been returned to the court of 
origin. Copy of the motion was sent to the adverse party, and after hearing, the 
following "Auto" dated January 28, 1946 was issued by Judge Emilio Peña:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No habiendo comparecido la representacion del demandante el dia señalado 
para la vista de la reconstitucion del presente expediente, no obstante haber 
sido debidamente notificado, dese por reconstituido el mismo, con las copias de 
los escritos presentados y la declaracion prestada por la representacion del 
demandado."</p></blockquote>
<p>The record now contains a copy of the decision of the court of first instance 
of November 21, 1941, and of the resolution of the Court of Appeals dismissing 
the appeal therefrom. Attorney Tansinsin testified at the reconstitution 
hearing, that an appeal to the Supreme Court had been made from the resolution 
of the Court of Appeals, but that said resolution had been affirmed by this 
highest court.</p>
<p>More than one month after the above-quoted order had been promulgated, herein 
petitioner asked for a writ of execution of the decision.</p>
<p>Counsel for respondent objected to the petition on the ground that there was 
"nothing in the record to show that the Supreme Court has acted on the appeal by 
certiorari" from the Court of Appeals. He argued that the mere verbal allegation 
of counsel for herein petitioner was insufficient, unless supported by 
documentary evidence to show that the Supreme Court had said the last word. The 
respondent, Judge Garcia, was convinced, and refused to issue the order of 
execution.</p>
<p>Hence, this petition.</p>
<p>His Honor, the trial judge, undoubtedly fell into error. The "auto" declaring 
the record reconstituted "con las copias de los escritos presentados y la 
declaracion prestada por la representation del demandado" was already final. 
Respondent Basilio Garcia never attempted to have that order modified or 
revoked, in spite of the fact that he knew the reconstitution proceedings were 
going on according to the rules, his attorney having actually gone to the court 
hearing, although he arrived late that day. Supposing <i>arguendo</i>, that 
Judge Peña erred in accepting, for purposes of reconstitution, the testimony of 
Atty. Tansinsin to the effect that the Supreme Court had refused the appeal from 
the Court of Appeals, his error, if any, was not jurisdictional. So that another 
judge of the same court has no authority to modify or revoke the order after it 
had become final. It may be stated, in this connection, that we perceive no 
unsurmountable objection to the admission of oral testimony concerning such 
resolution where circumstances are shown permitting secondary proof of 
documentary evidence, specially when the resolution was limited to the single 
point regarding admission or rejection of the appeal. As a matter of fact, 
section 45 of Act No. 3110 specifically directs that nothing contained in that 
law shall affect section 321 of Act No. 190 which permits the introduction of 
secondary evidence to prove the contents of a document.</p>
<p>We notice that counsel for respondents is careful not to deny under oath that 
the Supreme Court had already acted on the case. He merely affirms that there is 
(now) no record of such action "before the outbreak of the war on December, 
1941" or "after the last war"; assertions which obviously do not meet the 
attorney's testimony that said Supreme Court had finally acted on the matter 
<i>sometime in July, 1944</i>, i. e. "during the war or occupation". Should 
respondents wish to insinuate that the action of the Supreme Court "during the 
war" is null and void, they are reminded that that contention has been found 
unmeritorious in the Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon 
decision.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span></p>
<p>Therefore, inasmuch as the court's order of January 28, 1946, amounted to a 
declaration that its judgment of November 21, 1941, had become final and 
executory, and since that order is now unappealable, the conclusion follows that 
it is the court's ministerial duty to carry out the decision and must issue the 
writ of execution.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>Let the prayer be granted, with costs against the respondent Basilio 
Garcia.</p><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Feria, Pablo, Hontiveros, Padilla,</i> and 
<i>Tuason, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br>

<p><strong>HILADO, J.:</strong></p>I concur in the result. Although under my 
consistent stand from Co Kim Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (75 Phil., 
113), through subsequent cases down to the present, I accord no validity to the 
proceedings had in the occupation Court of Appeals and Supreme Court in the 
case, the fact is that since the recreation of the Court of Appeals of this 
Republic (in my opinion a different tribunal from the occupation Court of 
Appeals as shown in my dissent in G. R. No. 48911, Facundo <i>vs</i>. Laurente), 
respondent Basilio Garcia has done nothing to perfect an appeal to said Republic 
Court of Appeals, supposing that the judgment of the Court of First Instance had 
not acquired finality before the war. This fact in my opinion gave way to the 
judgment of the Court of First Instance becoming final and executory before the 
petition herein was filed.<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<div align="center"><br><br><em>DISSENTING</em></div>
<p><strong>PERFECTO, J.:</strong></p>
<p>The petition must be denied.</p>
<p>Petitioner seeks to compel the respondent judge to issue immediately an order 
for execution of the judgment in civil case No. R-7848 of the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal, rendered on November 21, 1941.</p>
<p>There is no question that the case was appealed. Petitioner alleged that the 
Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal and said dismissal was affirmed by the 
Supreme Court in July, 1944.</p>
<p>Respondent Basilio Garcia alleges that there is nothing in the record to show 
that the Supreme Court has acted on the appeal by certiorari, arguing that the 
allegation of counsel for petitioner is insufficient, not being supported by 
documentary evidence.</p>
<p>Judge Eulalio Garcia stated in his order of March 29, 1946, denying the 
petition for execution of judgment, that in the reconstituted case neither the 
alleged resolution of the Court of Appeals dismissing the appeal, nor the 
alleged decision of the Supreme Court denying or dismissing the petition for 
certiorari, appear.</p>The case having been appealed and there being no 
documentary evidence to show that the appeal has been dismissed, the petition to 
execute the appealed judgment is unmeritorious. Besides, if it is true that the 
dismissal of the petition for certiorari was ordered in July, 1944, the 
dismissal must have been ordered by the Supreme Court of the puppet republic 
established by the Japanese occupants. We recognize no validity in the actions 
of said Supreme Court, for the reasons already stated in our opinions in Co Kim 
Cham <i>vs</i>. Valdez Tan Keh and Dizon (75 Phil., 113).</div>
