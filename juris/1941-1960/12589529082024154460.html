				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a petition for a review of a judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals under section&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; Republic Act No. 1125, affirming&nbsp; the assessment&nbsp; made by the&nbsp; Collector of Internal Revenue&nbsp; and ordering the petitioner to pay the sum of P2,938.20&nbsp; as deficiency&nbsp; sales tax imposed&nbsp; by section&nbsp; 186,&nbsp; as amended by Republic Acts Nos.&nbsp; 588, 594 and 894, of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code and surcharge&nbsp; for the&nbsp; period from 1949&nbsp; to 1953&nbsp; inclusive. The facts are not disputed.&nbsp; As found by the Court&nbsp; of Tax Appealsâ€”<br><blockquote>This is an appeal&nbsp; from the decision of the&nbsp; respondent Collector of Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; assessing and demanding&nbsp; from the petitioner the payment of the&nbsp; sum of P2,938.20 as&nbsp; deficiency&nbsp; sales&nbsp; tax and surcharge, and the additional sum of P250.00&nbsp; in extra-judicial settlement of his&nbsp; penal liability&nbsp; for&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the provisions of the National Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code, or a total of P3,188.20.<br><br>&nbsp;It appears&nbsp; that petitioner&nbsp; Lim&nbsp; Tiong&nbsp; owns and&nbsp; operates the Manila Lumber which is provided with C-13 privilege tax receipt for buying&nbsp; and selling&nbsp; logs and lumber,&nbsp; and&nbsp; C-14&nbsp; privilege tax receipt for&nbsp; buying logs&nbsp; intended to be&nbsp; sold&nbsp; after&nbsp; having&nbsp; been cut into standard sizes of&nbsp; lumber.&nbsp; The petitioner,&nbsp; not&nbsp; being&nbsp; an owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; a sawmill, merely buys logs and have&nbsp; them processed into lumber of various&nbsp; sizes by&nbsp; the Oriental Sawmill, Pio Barretto &amp; Sons and other&nbsp; sawmills in&nbsp; Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then pays the sawmill owners&nbsp; for their&nbsp; services rendered&nbsp; computed&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; number&nbsp; of board&nbsp; feet cut and/or&nbsp; sawn.&nbsp; (Memorandum&nbsp; for&nbsp; the Petitioner, p. 1;&nbsp; Stipulation of&nbsp; Facts, par. 2.)<br><br>Prior to September 22, 1950,&nbsp; the&nbsp; date when Republic Act No. 588 took effect, the&nbsp; petitioner had&nbsp; been paying 5 per cent sales tax on the gross&nbsp; selling&nbsp; price&nbsp; of the lumber&nbsp; after deducting the cost of the logs.&nbsp; After the date just mentioned, the petitioner continued&nbsp; to pay the 5&nbsp; per cent sales tax but computed on the 33 1/3 % of&nbsp; the gross cost of logs purchased and1 from which said lumber were processed,&nbsp; pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 186 of the&nbsp; National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended by Republic Acts&nbsp; Nos. 588, 594&nbsp; and 894.<br><br>On&nbsp; May 21, 1954,&nbsp; the respondent Collector of Internal Revenue issued&nbsp; an&nbsp; assessment and demand against the&nbsp; petitioner requiring the payment of the&nbsp; sum of P2,938.20 as deficiency sales tax and surcharge&nbsp; covering the&nbsp; period from&nbsp; 1949 to 1953,&nbsp; inclusive, plus the additional amount of P250.00 in extrajudicial settlement of his penal&nbsp; liability.&nbsp; The said deficiency assessment which is the subject of&nbsp; the&nbsp; present appeal,&nbsp; was computed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent on&nbsp; the basis of 5% sales&nbsp; tax&nbsp; on the gross&nbsp; sales of lumber less the cost of&nbsp; the&nbsp; logs converted&nbsp; into such lumber in accordance with&nbsp; the first paragraph of&nbsp; Section 186 of the Tax Code, as amended.&nbsp; The petitioner admits the correctness and accuracy of the figures in the deficiency&nbsp; assessment but questions the basis&nbsp; on which&nbsp; the said assessment was computed.<br><br>The only question&nbsp; at&nbsp; issue&nbsp; in this case is the determination&nbsp; of whether or not the&nbsp; petitioner is "an&nbsp; operator of a&nbsp; sawmill"&nbsp; in order&nbsp; that&nbsp; he can&nbsp; take advantage of the provisions of the&nbsp; second paragraph&nbsp; of section 186 of the National Internal Revenue Code with respect to the payment of the&nbsp; 5% sales tax on&nbsp; the lumber he&nbsp; is&nbsp; selling.<br></blockquote>The petitioner contends that he is an operator of a sawmill or at least one&nbsp; by fiction of law, as&nbsp; according to him a sawmill&nbsp; is a&nbsp; factory&nbsp; or manufacturing&nbsp; establishment where logs are cut, sawn and converted into lumber of&nbsp; different&nbsp; sizes, and&nbsp; as&nbsp; in the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; sales tax he&nbsp; is considered a manufacturer of lumber under section 186 of the National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code, he must be deemed also to be an operator of&nbsp; a sawmill, for one cannot be a manufacturer of lumber without being an operator of a sawmill.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court held:<br><blockquote>* * * the records clearly show that&nbsp; he does not&nbsp; own or operate one, nor did he, at one time or another, ever enter into a contract of&nbsp; lease of a sawmill.&nbsp; No iota of evidence was presented to show that during the period in question, the petitioner was in possession of, or at&nbsp; least had something&nbsp; to do with&nbsp; the running&nbsp; of any sawmill.&nbsp;&nbsp; He merely hired&nbsp; the services of&nbsp; operators&nbsp; and owners of&nbsp; sawmills on piece of work basis, and paid them for their work rendered computed on the number of&nbsp; board&nbsp; feet cut and/or sawn. <br><br>* * * It is&nbsp; our considered opinion&nbsp; that the term "operators of sawmills"&nbsp; as used in section&nbsp; 186 of the National Internal&nbsp; Revenue Code refers only to those who&nbsp; actually supervise,&nbsp; manage&nbsp; and control the operation of&nbsp; sawmills.&nbsp; In the instant&nbsp; case, the petitioner has no&nbsp; say whatsoever in&nbsp; the&nbsp; management&nbsp; and operation of&nbsp; any&nbsp; sawmill and we&nbsp; hold that he is&nbsp; not&nbsp; an&nbsp; operator&nbsp; of&nbsp; a sawmill.<br><br>Moreover, the petitioner does&nbsp; not possess the necessary permit from the Director&nbsp; of Forestry for the operation of a sawmill which is required by Republic&nbsp; Act No. 460. To our mind, this&nbsp; is&nbsp; a clear index that the petitioner is in reality not an&nbsp; operator of&nbsp; a sawmill&nbsp; which&nbsp; he&nbsp; pretends to be, and bolsters our&nbsp; conclusion that he&nbsp; should&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the percentage sales tax under the first paragraph of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 186 of&nbsp; the National&nbsp; Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code.<br></blockquote>There&nbsp; is no reason which would justify a contrary pronouncement.<br><br>The petitioner claims that the judgment under review if not reversed&nbsp; would violate the rule of uniformity in taxation ordained by the&nbsp; Constitution,&nbsp; because&nbsp; there would be&nbsp; original&nbsp; sales of sawn&nbsp; lumber manufactured&nbsp; out of purchased&nbsp; logs&nbsp; taxed&nbsp; on their&nbsp; gross&nbsp; selling&nbsp; price&nbsp; less the cost of logs purchased and original sales of the same sawn lumber taxed&nbsp; on the 33 1/3%&nbsp; of&nbsp; the gross cost of logs purchased&nbsp; and&nbsp; intended for manufacture.&nbsp; Section 186, as amended,&nbsp; of the National Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code makes a&nbsp; distinction between the&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of the tax on original sales of forest products payable by the manufacturer or&nbsp; producer and that on original sales payable&nbsp; by operators and proprietors of sawmills who&nbsp; buy logs for the purpose of sawing&nbsp; and/or&nbsp; cutting&nbsp; them into lumber of standard sizes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within&nbsp; each class&nbsp; there is&nbsp; uniformity of&nbsp; taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the constitutional&nbsp; mandate on uniformity of taxation&nbsp; is not&nbsp; infringed upon. Republic Act No.&nbsp; 460 requires operators of sawmills to obtain&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director of Forestry&nbsp; permits for&nbsp; the operation of such sawmills.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why the petitioner did not secure any&nbsp; permit&nbsp; was because he&nbsp; did not and does&nbsp; not operate a&nbsp; sawmill.<br><br>The&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; under&nbsp; review is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs against the petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
