				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal by certiorari from the decision of the Court 
of Appeals.
<p align="justify">According to the findings of said Court, in 1927 respondent 
Joaquin Chan Chico built a house on his lot No. 7, described in transfer 
certificate of title No. 24239. When that house was constructed, Prudencia 
Rodriguez was yet the owner of the adjoining lot No. 6 belonging now to 
petitioner Co Tao. About a year after petitioner bought lot No. 6, he built a 
house thereon and he used lumber that butted in respondent's house. Respondent 
protested and his protest was resented by petitioner. Hence, the present 
suit.</p>
<p align="justify">It is now claimed by petitioner that the respondent's house 
took a portion of petitioner's land. The Court of Appeals, after examining the 
evidence, found that respondent's house occupies 6.97 square meters of 
petioner's lot, but that respondent acted in good faith. Accordingly, the Court 
of Appeals declared "that the plaintiff (petitioner) has the right to elect to 
purchase that portion of the defendant's (respondent's) house which protrudes 
into the plaintiff's property, or to sell to the defendant the land upon which 
the said portion of the defendants house is built." And the case was remanded to 
the Court of First Instance "with direction to require the plaintiff to make the 
election as herein provided, within the time that the Court shall fix, and 
thereafter to reset the case for the admission of the evidence on the value of 
the improvement, in case the plaintiff elects to buy the same, or the value of 
the land, in case he elects to sell it, and to render decision as the result of 
the new trial shall warrant." From this decision petitioner appealed by 
certiorari to this Court.</p>
<p align="justify">All the questions raised by the petitioner are unmeritorious. 
He alleges, for instance, that respondent could not have acted in good faith in 
building a portion of his house beyond the limits of his land, because he ought 
to know the metes and bounds of his property as stated in his certificate of 
title. But, as rightly stated by the Court of Appeals: "It is but stating the 
obvious to say that outside of the individuals versed in the science of 
surveying, and this is already going far, no one can determine the precise 
extent or location of his property by merely examining his paper title. The fact 
is even surveyors cannot with exactitude do so. The disagreement among the three 
surveyors in the case at hand who have made a resurvey of the ground with the 
aid of scientific devices and of their experience and knowledge of surveying, is 
a graphic and concrete illustration of this truth."</p>
<p align="justify">And there is another circumstance showing respondent's good 
faith. The Court of Appeals found that "the defendant's title dated back to 
March 12, 1923, and he built his house as early as 1927. When this was done, it 
has also been shown, there was a stone wall which had existed since as early as 
1902, and inside which the defendant's house is constructed. Prudencia Rodriguez 
herself, who was still the owner of the adjoining land when the defendant built 
his house in 1927, must have been under the same impression, since, as has been 
stated, she allowed the construction without making any protest during or after 
the construction."</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner alleges that it is not fair for him to pay for the 
building erected on his lot which is not only prejudicial but is certainly a 
nuissance to his property. The petitioner is indeed overlooking the circumstance 
that he is not being forced to buy the building for he has the option to sell 
the portion of his lot occupied by that building. The provisions of article 361 
of the Civil Code admit of no distinction.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed 
with costs against the petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Paras, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, 
concur.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p align="justify">FERIA, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">I dissent.</p>
<p align="justify">Under Rule 46 of the Rules of Court, appeal by certiorari from 
a judgment or decision of the Court of Appeals under said Rule lies only in 
cases in which question or questions of law are involved, because only questions 
of law may be raised therein, and consequently this Court can not review the 
findings of fact of said court.</p>
<p align="justify">In all judicial cases, the justiciable question is always 
either one of fact and law, or of law only if the facts on which it is 
predicated are admitted or not in issue. It can never be a question of fact 
only, because the administration of justice consists in the application of the 
law to the facts of each case submitted to the Court for decision. The facts are 
the minor premise of the sylogism, the law applicable to them the major premise, 
and the conclusion drawn from the sylogism is the conclusion or finding of law 
necessary for the decision of cases or lawsuits by the courts.</p>
<p align="justify">If the facts as found by the Court of Appeals are not 
questioned or in issue, and only the law applicable to the case or the 
conclusion of law to be drawn from such application is in issue in an appeal, 
the question involved is of law and the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review 
and pass upon the conclusions or findings of law of the Court of Appeals, 
however, if not only the law applicable and, consequently, the inference or 
conclusion to be drawn from the application thereof, but the findings of fact of 
the Court of Appeals are in issue, the question involved in the appeal is not of 
law but of fact; because no question of law may arise before the facts to which 
the law may be applied have been finally determined or found.</p>
<p align="justify">In the present appeal, the questions involved are of fact 
because the issue is whether or not the findings of fact of the Court of 
Industrial Relations discussed and passed upon by the majority in the decision 
are supported by the evidence in the record, that is, whether or not the 
respondent acted in good faith in building his house on part of the lot claimed 
by the petitioners, which depends upon whether or not the respondent knew then 
that part of the lot on which he erected the building belonged to the 
petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify">The question whether or not it is fair for the petitioners to 
pay for the building erected on his lot, depends also on the question of fact 
whether the building was erected on it by the respondent in good or bad 
faith.</p>
<p align="justify">This Supreme Court has, therefore, no jurisdiction to review 
the decision of the Court of Appeals in the present case, because the appeal 
does involve not a question of law but of fact, and this Court has no power to 
review the findings of fact in the decision of the said Court of Appeals, as 
already stated above. A decision of the said Court on questions of fact is final 
and not appealable.</p>
<p align="justify">We should have dismissed the petition for certiorari by way of 
appeal from the start filed in this case, but the fact that we have given it due 
course in order to determine whether appeal lies after hearing the adverse 
party, does not necessarily authorize us to pass upon the findings of fact of 
the Court of Appeals and affirm or referse the decision appealed from. To affirm 
or reverse a judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case presupposes a review 
by us of the findings of fact on which it is based, which we have power to 
do.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition for certiorari by way of appeal is therefore 
dismissed. We can not review and affirm or reverse the decision of the Court of 
Appeals in this case. So ordered.</p></div>
