				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In an amended decision dated October 9, 1951, issued in Land Registration Case No. 12, G. L. R. O. Rec. No. 2835, the Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Sorsogon decreed the registration of Lots Nos. 1798&nbsp; and 1799 of the Juban (Sorsogon) Cadastre, under the following terms and conditions:<br><blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, and it appearing that the notices have been duly published and posted as required by law, and that the title of the applicant to the above-mentioned two parcels of land is registrable in law, it is hereby adjudged and decreed, and with reaffirmation of the order of general default, that the two parcels of land described in&nbsp; plan SWO-24152, known as Lots Nos. 1798 and 1799 of the Cadastral Survey of Juban, with their improvements, be registered in the name of Maria Cano, Filipina, 71 years of age, widow and resident of Juban, province of Sorsogon, with the understanding that Lot No. 1799 shall be subject to the right of reservation in favor of Eustaquia Guerrero pursuant to Article 891 of the Civil Code. After this decision shall have become final, for lack of appeal therefrom within the 30-day period from its promulgation, let the corresponding decree issue.<br><br>SO ORDERED." (Rec. App. pp. 18-19)<br></blockquote>The decision having become final, the decree and the Certificate of Title (No. 0-20) were issued in the name of Maria Cano, subject to, <span style="font-style: italic;">reserva troncal</span> in favor of Eustaquia Guerrero. In October 1955, counsel for the reservee (<span style="font-style: italic;">reservatario</span>) Guerrero filed a motion with the Cadastral Court, alleging the death of the original registered owner and <i>reservista's</i>, Maria Cano, on September 8, 1955, and praying that the original Certificate of Title be ordered cancelled and a new one issued in favor of movant Eustaquia Guerrero; and that the Sheriff be ordered to place her in possession of the property.&nbsp; The motion was opposed by Jose and Teotimo Fernandez, sons of the <i>reservista's</i>. Maria Cano, who contended that the application and operation of the <i>reserva troncal</i>&nbsp; should be ventilated in an ordinary contentious proceeding, and that the Registration Court did not have jurisdiction to grant the motion.<br><br>In view of the recorded <i>reserva</i> in favor of the appellee, as expressly noted in the final decree of registration, the lower court granted the petition for the issuance of a new certificate, for the reason that the death of the <i>reservista's</i> vested the ownership of the property in the petitioner as the sole <i>reservatario troncal</i>.<br><br>The oppositors, heirs of the <i>reservista's</i> Maria Cano, duly appealed from the order, insisting that the ownership of the <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatario </span>can not be decreed in a mere proceeding under sec. 112 of Act 496, but requires a judicial&nbsp; administration proceedings, wherein the rights of appellee,&nbsp; as the <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatario</span> entitled to the reservable property,&nbsp; are&nbsp; to&nbsp; be declared.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this&nbsp; connection, appellants argue that the reversion&nbsp; in favor of the <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatario </span>requires the declaration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of the following facts:<br><blockquote>"(1) The property was received by&nbsp; a descendant&nbsp; by&nbsp; gratuitous title from&nbsp; an ascendant&nbsp; or from a brother or sister;<br>(2) Said descendant&nbsp; dies without&nbsp; issue;<br>(3) The property is&nbsp; inherited by&nbsp; another ascendant by operation of law;&nbsp; and<br>(4) The existence of relatives&nbsp; within the third degree belonging to the line from&nbsp; which&nbsp; said property came." (Appellants' Brief,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 8)<br></blockquote>We find the appeal untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The requisites&nbsp; enumerated by appellants have already been&nbsp; declared&nbsp; to exist by&nbsp; the&nbsp; decree of registration wherein the&nbsp; rights&nbsp; of the appellee as&nbsp; <i>reservatario troncal</i> were expressly recognized:<br><blockquote>"From the above-quoted&nbsp; agreed stipulation of&nbsp; facts, it is evident.that Lot No.&nbsp; 1799 was acquired&nbsp; by the applicant Maria Cano by inheritance from her deceased daughter. Lourdes Guerrero who, in turn,&nbsp; inherited the&nbsp; same from her father Evaristo Guerrero and, hence,&nbsp; falls squarely under the provisions of Article&nbsp; 891 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil Code;&nbsp; and that each and everyone of the private&nbsp; oppositors are within the third degree of consanguinity of&nbsp; the&nbsp; decedent Evaristo Guerrero, and who belong to the same&nbsp; line from which the property came.<br><br>It appears, however,&nbsp; from the agreed stipulation of facts that, with the exception&nbsp; of Eustaquia Guerrero, who is the only living daughter of&nbsp; the decedent Evaristo Guerrero, by his former marriage,&nbsp; all the other oppositors are grand-children of the said Evaristo Guerrero&nbsp; by his former marriages.&nbsp; Eustaquia Guerrero, being the nearest of kin, excludes all the other private&nbsp; oppositors, whose&nbsp; degree of relationship to the decedent is remoter (Article&nbsp; 962, Civil Code; Director of Lands&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Aguas, 62 Phil. 279)."(Rec. App. pp. 16-17)<br></blockquote>This decree having become final,&nbsp; all persons&nbsp; (appellees included) are barred thereby from contesting the existence of the constituent elements of the reserva. The only requisites for the passing of the title from the <i>reservista</i> to the appellee are: (1) the death of the <i>reservista</i>; and (2) the fact that the <span style="font-style: italic;">rersevatario </span>has survived the <i>reservista</i>. Both facts are admitted, and their existence is nowhere questioned.<br><br>The contention that an intestacy proceeding is still necessary rests upon the assumption that the reservatario will succeed in, or inherit, the reservable property from the <i>reservista'</i>s. This is not true.&nbsp; The <i>reservatario</i> is not the <i>reservista's</i> successor <i>mortis causa</i> nor is the reservable property part of the <i>resersvista's</i> estate; the <i>reservatario</i> receives the property as a conditional heir of the descendant (<i>prepositus</i>),"said property merely reverting to the line of origin from which it had temporarily and accidentally strayed during the <i>reservista's</i> lifetime.&nbsp; The authorities are all agreed that there being <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatarios </span>that survive the <i>reservista</i>, the latter must be deemed to have enjoyed no more than a life interest in the reservable property.<br><br>It is a consequence of these principles that upon the death of the <i>reservista</i>, the <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatario </span>nearest to the <span style="font-style: italic;">prepositus </span>(the appellee in this case) becomes, <i>automatically and by operation of law</i>, the owner of the reservable property. As already stated, that property is no part of the estate of the <i>reservista</i>, and does not even answer for the debts of the latter.&nbsp; Hence, its acquisition by the <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatario </span>may be entered in the property records without necessity of estate proceedings, since the basic requisites therefor appear of record.&nbsp; It is equally well settled that the reservable property can not be transmitted by a <i>reservita</i> to her or his own successors <i>mortis causa</i>, (like appellants herein) so long as a reservatario within the third degree from the <i>prepositus</i> and belonging to the line whence the property came, is in existence when the <i>reservista</i> dies.<br><br>Of course, where the registration decree merely specifies the reservable character of the property, without determining the identity of the <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatario </span>(as in the case of Director of Lands <i>vs.</i> Aguas, 63 Phil. 279) or where several <span style="font-style: italic;">reservatarios </span>dispute the property among themselves, further proceedings would be unavoidable.&nbsp; But this is not the case.&nbsp; The rights of the <i>reservataria</i> Eustaquia Guerrero have been expressly recognized, and it is nowhere claimed that there are other <i>reservatarios</i> of equal or nearer degree.&nbsp; It is thus apparent that the heirs of the <i>reservista</i>, are merely endeavoring to prolong their enjoyment of&nbsp; the reservable property to the detriment of the party lawfully entitled thereto.<br><br>We find no error in the order appealed from and therefore, the same is affirmed with costs against appellants in both instances . <br><br>So Ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion</i> and <i>Endencia JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
