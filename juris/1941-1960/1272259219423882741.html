area of 24,179 square meters and to return the land to its former 
condition under the expenses of the defendant." * * *</p>

<p>y ademas a pagar P9,756.19 de daños y P5,000 de honorarios de 
abogado, con las costas R. on A., pp. 5-6.</p>
<p> El demandado, por medio del Procurador General, presento mocion de 
sobreseimiento de la demanda por el fundamento de que el Juzgado no 
tiene jurisdiccion para dictar sentencia valida contra el, toda vez que 
judicialmente la reclamation es contra la Republica de Filipinas, y esta
 no ha presentado su consentimiento a la demanda. El Juzgado inferior 
estimo la mocion y sobreseyo la demanda sin perjuicio y sin costas.</p>
<p> En apelacion, la demandante sostiene que fue un error considerar la 
demanda como una contra la Republica y sobreseer en su virtud la 
demanda.</p>
<p> La mocion contra "Isaias Fernando, Director de Obras Publicas, 
encargado y responsable de la construction de los sistemas de irrigation
 en Filipinas" es una dirigida <em>personalmente</em> contra el, por 
actos que asumio ejecutar en su concepto oficial. La ley no le exime de 
responsabilidad por las extralimitaciones que cometa o haga cometer en 
el desempeno de sus f unciones oficiales.</p>
<p> Un caso semej ante es el de Nelson <em>vs</em>. Bobcock (1933) 18 
minn. 584, 24 NW 49, 90 ALR 1472. Alii el Comisionado de Carreteras, al 
mejorar un trozo de la carretera ocupo o se apropio de terrenos 
contiguos al derecho de paso. El Tribunal Supremo del Estado declaro que
 ea personalmente responsable al dueno de los danos causados. Declaro 
ademas que la ratification de lo que hicieron sus subordinados era 
equivalente a una orden a los mismos. He aqui lo dijo el Tribunal.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "We think the evidence and conceded facts permitted the jury in 
finding that in the trespass on plaintiff's land defendant committed 
acts outside the scope of his authority. When he went outside the 
boundaries of the right of way upon plaintiff's land and damaged it or 
destroyed its former condition and usefulness, he must be held to have 
designedly departed from the duties imposed on him by law. There can be 
no claim that he thus invaded plaintiff's land southeasterly of the 
right of way innocently. Surveys clearly marked the limits of the land 
appropriated for the right of way of this trunk highway before 
construction began. * * *.</p>
  <p> "'Ratification may be equivalent to command, and cooperation may 
be inferred from acquiescence where there is power to restrain.' It is 
unnecessary to consider other cases cited, * * *, for as before 
suggested, the jury could find or infer that, in so far as there was 
actual trespass by appropriation of plaintiff's land as a dumping place 
for the rock to be removed from the additional appropriated right of 
way, defendant planned, approved, and ratified what was done by his 
subordinates."—Nelson <em>vs</em>. Bobcock, 90 A. L. R., 1472, 1476, 
1477.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> La doctrina sobre la responsabilidad civil de los funcionarios en 
casos parecidos se resume como sigue:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Ordinarily the officer or employee committing the tort is 
personally liable therefor, and may be sued as any other citizen and 
held answerable for whatever injury or damage results from his tortious 
act."—<em>49 Am. Jur. 289.</em></p>
  <p> * * * If an officer, even while acting under color of his office, 
exceeds the power conferred on him by law, he cannot shelter himself 
under the plea that he is a public agent."—<em>43 Am. Jur. 86.</em></p>
  <p> "It is a general rule that an officer executive, administrative 
quasi-judicial, ministerial, or otherwise who acts outside the scope of 
his jurisdiction and without authorization of law may thereby render 
himself amenable to personal liability in a civil suit. If he exceeds 
the power conferred on him by law, he cannot shelter himself by the plea
 that he is a public agent acting under color of his office, and not 
personally. In the eye of the law, his acts then are wholly without 
authority." Am. Jur. 89-90.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> El articulo 32 del Codigo Civil dice, a su vez:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "ART. 32. Any public officer or employee, or any private 
individual, who directly or indirectly obstructs, defeats, violates or 
in any manner impedes or impairs any of the following rights and 
liberties of another person shall be liable to the latter for damages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> "In any of the cases referred to in this article, whether or not 
the defendant's acts or omission constitutes a criminal offense, the 
aggrieved party has a right to commence an entirely separate and 
distinct civil action for damages, and for other relief. Such action 
shall proceed independently of any criminal prosecution (if the latter 
be instituted), and may be proved by a preponderance of evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Se revoca la orden apelada y se ordena la continuacion de la 
tramitacion de la demanda conforme proveen los reglamentos. Sin especial
 pronunciamiento en cuanto a las costas. Asi se ordena.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></h3>
<p><strong>CONCEPCION, J.,:</strong></p>
<p> To my mind, the allegations of the complaint lead to no other 
conclusion than that appellee Isaias Fernando is a party in this case, 
not in his personal capacity, but as an officer of the Government. 
According to said pleading the defendant is "Isaias Fernando, Director, 
Bureau of Public Works." Moreover, in paragraphs '4 and 5 of the 
complaint, it is alleged:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "4. That the defendant <em>as</em> <em>Director of the Bureau of 
Public Works</em> is in charge of irrigation projects and systems, and 
the official responsible for the construction of irrigation system in 
the Philippines;</p>
  <p> 5. That the defendant, <em>as</em> <em>Director of the Bureau of 
Public Works</em>, without authority obtained first from the Court of 
First Instance of Ilocos Sur, without obtaining first a right of way, 
and without the consent and knowledge of the plaintiff, and against her 
express objection, unlawfully took possession of portions of the three 
parcels of land described above, and caused an irrigation canal to be 
constructed on the portion of the three parcels, of land on or about the
 month of February 1951 the aggregate area being 24,179 square meters to
 the damage and prejudice of the plaintiff." (Italics supplied.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The emphasis thus placed upon the allegation that the acts 
complained of were performed by said defendant "as Director of the 
Bureau of Public Works," clearly shows that the designation of his 
office was included in the title of the case to indicate that he was 
being sued in his official capacity. This conclusion is bolstered up by 
the fact that, among other things, plaintiff prays; in the complaint, 
for a judgment</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "Ordering the defendant to return or caused to be returned the 
possession of the portions of land unlawfully occupied and appropriated 
in the aggregate area of 24,179 square meters and to return the land to 
its former condition under the expense of the defendant." (Paragraph a, 
of the complaint).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> We take judicial notice of the fact that the irrigation projects and
 system referred to in the complaint—of which the defendant, Isaias 
Fernando, according to the same pleading, is "in charge" and for which 
he is "responsible" as Director of the Bureau of Public Works—are 
established and operated with public funds, which pursuant to the 
Constitution, must be appropriated by law. Irrespective of the manner in
 which the construction may have been undertaken by the Bureau of Public
 Works, the system or canal is, therefore, a property of the Government.
 Consequently, in praying that possession of the portions of land 
occupied by the irrigation canal involved in the present case be 
returned to plaintiff herein, and that said land be restored to its 
former condition, plaintiff seeks to divest the Government of its 
possession of said irrigation canal, and, what is worse, to cause said 
property of the Government to be removed or destroyed. As held in Syquia
 <em>vs</em>. Lopez<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[*]</sup></span> (47 Off. 
Gaz., 665), the Government is, accordingly, "the real party in interest 
as defendant" in the case at bar. In other words, the same partakes of 
the nature of a suit against the state and may not be maintained without
 its consent.</p>
<p> Hence I am constrained to dissent.<br>
