				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance 
of Rizal, Rizal City Branch, dismissing the above entitled case as to Maria D. 
Pastrana and her husband, Prudencio Castrence, with costs, upon motion of these 
defendants. The other defendants did not file any motion to dismiss.
<p align="justify">The defendants are several, majority of whom bought lots from 
the plaintiff, the rest being subsequent purchasers. The plaintiff's causes of 
action against them are separate and distinct from one another save for the fact 
that the lots involved are in the same subdivision belonging to the plaintiff 
and the issues are identical in their essential features. In this decision we 
shall state only the facts as they relate to Maria D. Pastrana and her 
husband.</p>
<p align="justify">According to the amended complaint, plaintiff Realty 
Investments, Inc. is the registered owner of the Valhalla Gardens Subdivision 
situated in Rizal City and mortgaged to the Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Company. On 
May 8, 1941, Maria D. Pastrana bought from the plaintiff one let known as 
262-VV, with a house of strong materials erected thereon, for P7,200, and paid 
P700 on account of the purchase price upon the execution of the deed of sale. 
The deed provided that the purchaser should pay to the vendor at its principal 
office in Manila the balance of P6,500, together with interest thereon at 10 per 
cent per annum, a monthly installment of not less than P85.93, beginning with 
the 31st of that month until she should have completed payment of the purchase 
price. It was further provided, among other conditions, that should the 
purchaser fail to make any of the payments due under the contract within 30 days 
after due date, all the unpaid balances would automatically become due and 
demandable in their entirety and the owner could, at its option, "either 
(<i>a</i>) consider this contract as rescinded, in which case the owner shall be 
at liberty to dispose of the property to any other person in the same manner as 
if this contract had never been made, and all sums of money paid hereunder shall 
be considered and treated as rents for use of the said property, the purchaser 
hereby waiving all right to ask for or demand the return thereof and agreeing to 
peaceably vacate the said property, or (<i>b</i>) repossess and sell the 
property at public or private sale and recover the balance of the purchase price 
and other amounts due after applying thereto the proceeds of such sale, together 
with reasonable attorney's fees."</p>
<p align="justify">Defendant Maria D. Pastrana had paid eight installments 
totalling P687.44, (of which P426.10 was applied to interest and P261.34 to 
principal, leaving a balance on her contract of the sum of P6,238.14), when the 
war between the United States and Japan broke out. On account of the war 
payments were interrupted, the plaintiff's office having been closed and its 
officers, being American citizens, interned.</p>
<p align="justify">In 1944, Maria D. Pastrana paid to the Enemy Property 
Custodian, Japanese Imperial Army in the Philippines, the remaining unpaid 
installments, after which, on the 21st of October of that year, the Register of 
Deeds of then Greater Manila, defendant Mariano Villanueva, cancelled the 
plaintiff's title with respect to lot 262-VV and issued to this defendant 
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 75513.</p>
<p align="justify">The complaint, after setting forth the above facts, and others 
not essential for the determination of this appeal, prays the Court to declare 
as due and payable on account of the purchase price the sum of P6,238.14; to 
declare null and void the purported sale executed by the Japanese Military 
authorities; to declare that plaintiff is the legal owner of lot 262-VV; and to 
order the Register of Deeds to reinstate plaintiff's title to said lot, "or in 
the alternative, order payment to the Realty Investments, Inc. * * * by 
defendant Maria D. Pastrana of the sum of P6,238.14 for lot 262-VV with the 
stipulated interest from April 1, 1945." It is a lso prayed that in the event of 
default in such payment, plaintiff Realty Investments, Inc. be adjudged entitled 
to the restoration of the premises as well as to reasonable rentals for the 
period during which defendants were in possession thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">The motion to dismiss is premised on the moratorium proclaimed 
in Executive Order No. 25 as amended by Executive Order No. 32. Judge Bienvenido 
A. Tan in granting the motion relied on Luis General vs. Hon. Jose de Venecia, 
78 Phil., 780, cited by the defendants in support of their motion.</p>
<p align="justify">In Ricardo Medina vs. Ambrosio Santos, 78 Phil., 464, it was 
held that a case for the recovery of a truck with prayer for payment of its 
value in case the truck was not returned, could proceed notwithstanding the 
moratorium law. The Court observed that the indemnity sought was a subsidiary 
liability and would not come into being unless and until decision was rendered 
against the defendants for such payment. In Moya vs. Barton, 79 Phil., 14, the 
Court said that when the cause of action was in part covered by the moratorium 
and in part not, it was not unjust to render judgment for the payment of the 
entire obligation with the understanding that execution with respect to the 
amounts that full due before March 10, 1945, would be stayed. And in Alejo vs. 
Gomez, L-1969, May 30, 1949<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, the Court 
ruled that suit for unlawful detainer and rents in arrears was not affected by 
the moratorium, the recovery of the unpaid rentals, it was said, being accessory 
to the main action.</p>
<p align="justify">A close examination of plaintiffs' allegations and prayer will 
disclose that the primary object of the action is to obtain a determination of 
the validity of the payments made by the defendants to the Japanese Alien 
Property Custodian, and of the title issued in pursuance of those payments. The 
case was improperly dismissed.</p>
<p align="justify">In the case at bar, the money judgment prayed for is not even 
an accessory or subsidiary to the main action. It is an alternative remedy and 
as such is contingent upon the defendants' unwillingness or inability to permit 
the cancellation of the title issued to them and to surrender the land. Whereas 
in an unlawful detainer suit, the defendant has no escape from the payment of 
the back rentals if he loses, the payment of money in the instant case rests on 
defendants' own choice between the two remedies demanded by the plaintiffs.</p>
<p align="justify">The case of De Venecia vs. General, <i>ante,</i> is easily 
distinguishable from this, in that the former was an action on a promissory note 
stripped of all other objectives, principal, accessory, subsidiary or 
alternative. Maao Sugar Central Co. vs. Conrado Barrios, 79 Phil., 666, is also 
unavailing to the defendants. That action, like General vs. De Venecia, had for 
its sole object the enforcement of a monetary obligation.</p>
<p align="justify">As a final word, let it be noted that the moratorium orders 
were conceived exclusively for the benefit of debtors in the strict sense of the 
term; <i>i.e.</i> for the suspension of payments in money during the time of 
financial distress occasioned by the late war. They were not intended to suspend 
other rights of action. And, as moratorium is in derogation of the protection 
against the impairment of the obligations ob contract and other constitutional 
guarantees, justified only as an emergency measure, Executive Orders Nos. 25 and 
32 are rigidly to be confined to cases which embrace only matters falling within 
the scope of their express purpose.</p>
<p align="justify">The appealed order is reversed and the respondent Judge is 
ordered to proceed with the trial of the case on the merits, with costs of this 
appeal against the appellees.</p>

and <i>Torres, JJ.</i>, concur. </p>
