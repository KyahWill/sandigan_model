				<H3>MIGUEL FLORES Y CAUBALIJO, PETITIONER, VS. THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS, RESPONDENT.

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus originally filed in 
this Court claiming that petitioner is being deprived of his liberty 
illegally by the respondent.
  <p>    It is alleged that petitioner was on July 22, 1949, indicted 
before the Court of First Instance of Bohol with other persons for 
illegal possession of explosives, and that when petitioner was 
arraigned, together with his co-accused, he pleaded guilty to the 
charge; that he was sentenced to suffer two years imprisonment and to 
pay a fine of P2,000 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency;
 that he was committed to prison on May 17, 1950 to serve his sentence 
which commenced to run on April 10, 1950; that he has fully served his 
sentence, considering the allowance to which he is entitled for good 
behavior; that about the end of June, 1952, he was notified by the 
prison authorities that as a result of the appealed interposed by his 
co-accused, the sentence imposed upon them was affirmed by the Court of 
Appeals and that, being one of those who appealed, he should be kept in 
confinement pursuant to the sentence imposed by the latter court; that 
it is not true that he appealed from the decision of the court of 
origin, the truth being that he pleaded guilty and began serving his 
sentence on April 10, 1950; and that, therefore, his continuance in 
prison under the decision of the Court of Appeals constitutes a 
deprivation of his liberty without due process of law.</p>
  <p>    The Solicitor General, in the return he submitted for 
respondent, claims that petitioner has not yet served his sentence in 
full for the reason that he is one of those who appealed from the 
decision of the court <i>a quo</i> to the Court of Appeals, finding them
 guilty of the crime charged; that the Court of Appeals affirmed the 
decision with respect to petitioner and acquitted seventeen (17) of his 
co-accused; that, as a result of the appeal, petitioner began serving 
his sentence on October 9, 1951, so that the penalty imposed upon him 
should expire on June 8, 1954; and that, giving him credit for 
preventive imprisonment (9 months and 3 days), for his work as sentenced
 prisoner (2 months and 29 days), and allowance for good conduct (2 
months and 25 days), he should be due for release on March 12, 1953 at 
the earliest.</p>
  <p>    We have gone over the pertinent portion of the brief submitted 
by the Solicitor General in connection with the appeal interposed by the
 accused in the instant case, as well as the decision of the Court of 
Appeals promulgated on October 9, 1951, and we are satisfied that the 
claim of the Solicitor General that petitioner is one of those who 
appealed from the decision in question, is correct.  The Court of 
Appeals, in affirming the decision of the trial court, stated petitioner
 is guilty of the crime charged beyond reasonable doubt and affirmed the
 sentence as to him.  The court even went as far as stating that 
petitioner is not entitled to the mitigating circumstance of plea of 
guilty because he was indicted under a special law.</p>
  <p>    Petition is denied.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Feria, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor, Reyes</i> 
and <i>Jugo, JJ.,</i> concur. <i><br>
    Pablo, J.,</i> no part.</p>
