				<H3>ALFONSO UMALI, FOR AND IN BEHALF OF 201 MEMBERS OF THE INDEPENDENT EMPLOYEES UNION, PETITIONER, VS. PRIMITIVO LOVINA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF LABOR OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PADILLA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for a writ of mandamus. It is alleged that on 25
November 194#, two hundred one (201) employees of the Jai Alai
Corporation of the Philippines banded and organized themselves into an
association or union adopting "Independent Employees Union" as the name
of their guild. The objectives, aims, or purposes of the union are as
those set forth in section 2 of Commonwealth Act 213. On 29 December,
the union filed with the Department of Labor a copy of its constitution
and by-laws (Appendices A and A-1). On 7 January 1949, the President of
the Independent Employees Union wrote a letter to the Secretary of
Labor requesting immediate and favorable action on the pending
application for registration of their labor organization (Appendix B).
On the same date, the Secretary of Labor wrote a letter to the
President of the Jai Alaistas Union of Employees, a registered and
licensed union, granting it an extension of time, or until the 15th of
the month, to hold an election under the supervision of the Department
of Labor, and warning the President of the union that should the
election be not held within the time granted, he would be compelled to
register and issue a permit to the Independent Employees Union
(Appendix C). In answer to said letter, the President of the Jai
Alaistas Union of Employees informed the Secretary of Labor that his
union had advanced the date of the general meeting to 23 instead of 30
January and reiterated that if the by-laws be amended and the term of
office of the board of directors be shortened, another election would
immediately be held for the purpose of electing a new board of
directors in accordance with the by-laws (Appendix D). On 15 January,
the Secretary of Labor wrote a letter to the President of the
Independent Employees Union, advising him that, in connection with the
application for registration of the Independent Employees Union, he
would not register it, because its registration would be contrary to
his policy of allowing one union only in one company, especially if the
unions be of the same nature, but that should the Jai Alaistas Union of
Employees fail to hold an election on 23 January 1949, in accordance
with the amended by-laws, he would register the Independent Employees
Union on the following day—24 January (Appendix E). Despite the failure
of the Jai Alaistas Union of Employees to hold a general election and
the promise of the Secretary of Labor that should such an election be
not held, he would register the Independent Employees Union the
following day, the said secretary has refused and still refuses to
register the application and to issue a permit to the Independent
Employees Union to operate as a legitimate labor organization.
<p> In his amended answer, the respondent justifies his failure to
register and to issue the permit applied for upon the following
grounds: (1) that there is no formal application filed by the
petitioner's union; (2) that up to the time of the filing of his
amended answer he has not investigated the activities, real aims, and
purposes of the Independent Employees Union, as required of him by
section 3 of Commonwealth Act 213, due to the failure of the
petitioner's union or its officials to accomplish and submit to him the
mimeographed questionnaire required to be filled out by the labor union
applicant; {3} that such failure to register and issue the permit is
due to his policy of recognizing one union only in one company, which
does not contravene any of the provisions of Commonwealth Act 213; (4)
that there is no fixed period provided for in Commonwealth Act 213,
within which he as Secretary of Labor must complete his investigation
and act upon the application; (5) that he has not denied or turned down
the application for registration and the issuance of the permit to
operate as a legitimate labor organization, nor has he committed a
grave abuse of discretion in not registering the papers filed by the
petitioner's union and issuing the permit applied for; and (6) that he
is clothed with discretion to issue or not the permit applied for.</p>
<p> Although there is no allegation either in the original or in the
amended petition that a formal application for registration and permit
was filed, the fact is that the respondent in his letter of 15 January
1949 addressed to the petitioner, as President of the Independent
Employees Union, made reference to an application for registration
(Appendix E). In the letter of 7 January 1949 of the Independent
Employees Union to the respondent, mention was made four times of a
pending application or petition for registration. On 3 February 1949 a
formal application for registration and permit was filed in behalf of
the Independent Employees Union by the National Labor Union (Annex 2 of
the answer).</p>
<p> Section 3 of Commonwealth Act 213 provides that after the filing of
an application to register and operate as a legitimate labor
organization, the Secretary of Labor "shall conduct an investigation of
the activities of the applying labor organization and if, on such
investigation, it shall appear that the applicant is entitled to
registration, he shall issue a permit therefor upon payment of the
registration fee of five pesos: * * * " It is claimed that this
investigation has not been completed or accomplished because of the
union's failure to fill out a questionnaire. An investigation to be
conducted by the Secretary of Labor need not take the form of a
questionnaire. What is asked in the questionnaire may be secured by
other means. He or his representative should conduct and complete that
investigation within a reasonable time. The failure of the officials of
the petitioner's union to answer or fill out the questionnaire is no
lawful excuse or reason for the respondent to neglect the performance
of his duty of conducting and completing the investigation required by
section 3 of Commonwealth Act 213. That the objectives, purposes, or
aims of the petitioner's union are lawful and in accordance with the
provisions of section 2 of Commonwealth Act 213 cannot be successfully
gainsaid, for the respondent had written to the President of the Jai
Alaistas Union of Employees that, if an election be not held on or
before the 15th of January 1949, he would be compelled to register and
issue the permit to the petitioner's union—Independent Employees Union
(Exhibit C). Again, on 15 January 1949, in connection with the
application of the petitioner's union for registration, the respondent
informed the petitioner, as President of the union, that should the Jai
Alaistas Union of Employees fail to hold an election on the 23rd day of
January 1949, he would register the petitioner's union the following
day—24 January 1949. These statements could not have been made by the
respondent without his department having conducted an investigation of
the activities of the petitioner's union to determine whether it is
entitled to registration and without he having found in or as a result
of such investigation that the purposes, aims, or objectives of the
petitioner's union do not tend "to undermine and destroy the
constituted government or to violate any law or laws of the
Philippines," which is the only ground or reason for refusing the
registration and permission to operate as a legitimate labor
organization, as provided for in section 2 of Commonwealth Act 213.</p>
<p> There being no lawful reason for the respondent to refuse the
registration of the application for the petitioner's union and
permission to operate as a legitimate labor organization; it being the
duty of the respondent to register the application and issue the permit
upon payment of the required fee, as provided for in section 3 of
Commonwealth Act 213, the investigation to be conducted by him, as
required by law, having been conducted and completed, as may be
inferred from his official statements in connection therewith, the
conclusion is inescapable that he has neglected the performance of an
act which the law specifically enjoins him to perform as a duty
resulting from his office, and that such neglect unlawfully excludes
the petitioner's union from the use and enjoyment of a right to which
it is entitled. It appearing further that there is no other plain,
speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the writ
prayed for should be, as is hereby, granted, without costs.</p>
<p> Writ granted.</p>

<p>PABLO, M., disidentes</p>
<p> Disiento.</p>
<p> La Ley No. 213 del Commonwealth en su artlculo primero dispone que
la constltucion y reglamento interior de un organismo obrero no deben
ser "contrarios o incorapatibles con las leyes de Filipinas." Y el
artlculo 2 en parte dispone que "no se denegard dicha inscripcion y
permiso a ningtln organismo obrero, a menos que Iste tenga por objeto
socavar y destruir el Gobierno constituldo o infringir cualquiera ley o
leyes de Filipinas, caso en que se ledenegard la ihscripcion y el
permiso de funcionar como organismo obrero legitimo." El artlculo 3
dispone que la solicitud de inscripcion se presentard al Secretario del
Trabajo, "y dicho Secretario investigarl las actividades del organismo
obrero solicitante y, si de dicha investigaci6n resultare que el
solicitante tiene dereeho a la inscripcidn, se le expedird el permiso
correspondiente."</p>
<p> Segun la contestacion del Secretario, los funcionarios de la union
solicitante no han devuelto aun el cuestionario con las contestaciones
correspondientes. A falta del cumplimiento de este requisito, el
Secretario del Trabajo no considera terminada Su investigacidn. No
consta en quo consiste este cuestionario pero debe ser importante, debe
requerir ciertos datos indispensables para que el Departamento del
Trabajo tenga perfecto conocimiento de los fines que persigue la union
y los medios de que dispone. El Departamento del Trabajo es el que debe
determinar que clase de informaciones necesita para poder decidir a
conciencia si un organismo solicitante esta en condiciones o no de
llevar a cabo los fines que persigue. No nos consta que las
contestaciones no son indispensables; pero cuando el Secretario del
Trabajo las requiere es de presumir que no son datos inutiles. Obligar
al Departamento del Trabajo que expida el permiso a un solicitante, sin
haber Iste devuelto aun sus contestaciones al cuestionario es
convertirle no en departamento con poderes para gobernar sino
convertirle en un simple titere. Eso equivale a ordenar a un juzgado
que dicte sentencia en un sentido deterrainado estando aun pendiente la
presentacion de ciertas pruebas—en el caso presente, contestaciones al
cuestionario—que en su opinidn son indispensables para esclarecer la
verdad. No creo que fue la intencion de la Legislatura crear
departamentos-maniqules. Las partes de los artlculos de la ley
transcritas demuestran a la legua que el Secretario del Trabajo tiene
discrecion para conceder o no el permiso. Lo mas que este Tribunal
puede ordenar, bajo los hechos sobre que descansa la opinion de la
mayoria, es ordenar al Secretario que resuelva la peticion concediendo
el permiso o no.</p>
<p> Voto por que se deniegue la solicitud.</p>
