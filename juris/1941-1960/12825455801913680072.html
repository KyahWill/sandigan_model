</style><div align="justify">In the proceedings of guarianship of the minor Josefa Ponce (Sp. Proc. No. 
11-R of Cebu), appellant Gregoria Daclan, second wife of the deceased Dionicio 
Uy Ching Siong (great grandfather of the said minor) and administratrix of his 
estate, had filed a motion asking for the annulment and revocation of previous 
orders authorizing the mortgage, and later the sale, of the minor's interest in 
lots Nos. 2668 and 8057 of the Cebu Cadastre, issued by the Court to the 
guardian Jose Ponce. The ground alleged was that said orders were secured 
without due notice to movant as representative of the heirs of Dionisio Uy Ching 
Siong; it being alleged by her that said lots 2668 and 8057 belonged exclusively 
to the estate of her deceased husband, because the latter had allegedly 
purchased all the interest of his first wife Catalina Taboada in said lots from 
the latter's heirs. The Court below denied the motion, finding that movant 
Gregoria Daclan, being only the minor's step-grandmother, "no es pariente de la 
citada menor de acuerdo con la ley" and hence was not entitled to notice of the 
guardianship proceedings (Rec. App. pp. 21-22). Daclan moved to reconsider said 
order but failed, hence this appeal.
<p>Said appellant now urges that the petition for the guardianship of the minor 
Josefa Ponce, as well as the motions for the mertgage and sale of her properties 
filed by her guardian Jose Ponce, are void and did not confer jurisdiction upon 
the Court for lack of notice to her (appellant) as next of kin.</p>
<p>The argument is without merit. By her own admission, appellant is the second 
wife of Dionisio Uy Ching Siong, great-grandfather of the minor; i.e., she is 
only the step great-grandmother of the child. Under Rule 94, Rules of Court, 
only the "next of kin" of the ward are entitled to notice of the guardianship 
proceedings, and "next of kin" has been interpreted by this Court to mean those 
relatives whose relationship is such that they are entitled to share in the 
minor's estate as distributees. (Lopez vs. Judge Teodoro, 47 Off. Gaz. (Suppl. 
to No. 12) p. 141) As the second wife of the minor's great-grandfather, 
appellant has absolutely no interest in her estate, since she would not even be 
a remote heir in case of the minor's death, not being related by blood to the 
latter. In our system of law, inestate succession devolves only upon blood 
relatives of the decedent, with the sole exception of the surviving spouse. 
Consequently, notice of these proceedings need not be given to appellant.</p>
<p>Appellant also claims that the petition for the appointm4ent of a guardian 
over the property of the minor did not confer jurisdiction upon the court 
because the same did not allege the names, ages and residence of the minor's 
relatives. Again the claim is untenable. Even assuming that the allegations as 
to the names, ages and residences of the minor's relatives is jurisdictional, 
the same was not necessary in this case, for the petition was filed by the 
minor's relatives themselves, to wit, her surviving great-grandmother Ignacia 
Zabate, grandaunt Dolores Taboada and her granduncles Flaviano, Francisco and 
Pedro Taboada, with the written consent of her widowed father, Jose Ponce. As 
for the fact that appellant was not named therein, appellant is not, as we have 
already stated, such relative as is entitled to notice of the petition and other 
proceedings of the guardianship.</p>
<p>Appellant's intervention in these proceedings appears to be, not for the 
purpose of protecting the interest and rights of the minor Josefa Ponce, but to 
claim and prove the interest adverse to that of the minor's, for it is the 
contention of appellant that the parcels of land represented by the guardian to 
belong to his ward, and mortgaged and sold by him as such guardian with 
authority of the court, do not belong to the minor but are properties of 
appellant and her children as heirs of her deceased husbandDionisio Uy Ching 
Siong. It is clear that such intervention is not proper in guardianship 
proceedings, which are aimed at safeguarding the rights and interest of the 
incompetent person. If it be true, as appellant claims, that the alleged 
properties of the minor Josefa Ponce really belong to her and her children as 
heirs of the late Dionisio Uy Ching Siong, her remedy, as pointed out by the 
Court below, is to ventilate said question in a separate action in the court of 
proper jurisdiction. Specially so, because the transactions under attack have 
already been consummated, and third persons' interests have become vested.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the orders appealed from are affirmed, with costs against 
appellant Gegoria Daclan.</p>
<p><em>Paras, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador</em>, and <em>Concepcion, JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
