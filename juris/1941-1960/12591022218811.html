				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This is an appeal from a decision rendered by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija in Civil Cases Nos.  1001 and  1006, which were  tried jointly.  The appeal was taken to the Court of  Appeals but that court has  certified the case to  us on the ground that the issues raised are purely legal.</p>
<p>The record  shows that sometime in August, 1931,  Prudencio Anastacio acquired the  homestead  rights of  one Eligio Paginag over a parcel of land known as Lot  No. 3875 of the Cadastral Survey of San Jose, Nueva Ecija, situated in barrio San Agustin of said municipality.  The transfer was,  upon recommendation of  the  Director of Lands,  approved by  the Secretary  of Agriculture  and Natural  Resources.  Consequently, the homestead  patent was  granted in the name of Prudencio Anastacio and on April 7, 1936, Original Certificate of Title No. 3849 was issued in his  name.   The lot  covered by the title, it appears, was a portion of Lots Nos. 3101, 3102  and 3108. Claiming  a  superior right,  Clemente  Lazaro contested the  right and  title of Prudencio Anastacio over Lot  No. 3875 with respect to the area embraced by Lots Nos. 3101 and 3102,  which,  according  to  him, had previously been awarded to him by the Bureau of Lands in a public  sale made under his Sales Application No. 10288.  In a decision rendered by the Director of Lands on August 5, 1937, Lazaro's claim and rights over Lots Nos. 3101 and 3102 were upheld and the award thereof to him was confirmed. No further action, however,  was taken on  his sales application.   In fact, no sales  patent has ever been  issued to  him.</p>
<p>For the cancellation of Original Certificate of Title No. 3849  issued is the name of Prudencio Anastacio, Clemente Lazaro, on October 18, 1937, filed an action in the Court of First Instance  of Nueva Ecija (Civil  Case No. 7725). On March 16 of the following year, he filed another action for injunction also against Prudencio Anastacio (Civil Case No. 7842).  On October  15, 1938, judgment was  rendered in Civil Case No. 7725 cancelling Original Certificate of Title  No.  3849 and  declaring the  land described therein to be public land duly covered by the sales application of Clemente Lazaro.  In the other  case, judgment was likewise  rendered making permanent the preliminary injunction issued  against Prudencio Anastacio.  Both  decisions became final and executory.  It appears, however, that no notice of <em>lis pendens</em> was registered in either case and that the decision ordering the cancellation of Original Certificate of  Title  No. 3849 was  not  registered  or annotated  on said certificate of title.</p>
<p>In  1943, Prudencio Anastacio disappeared.   Nine years thereafter, or on July 5,  IÂ§52,  his heirs  executed  a deed of extra-judicial settlement adjudicating  unto themselves Lot No. 3875.   In the same  deed, they sold  said  lot for P4,000.00 to Fidela R. Gomez.  The deed of extra-judicial settlement  and  sale was approved by the  Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources  and registered with the lands  record  of  Nueva  Ecija.   Thereafter,  Original Certificate  of Title No.  3849 in the name of Prudencio Anastacio covering Lot No. 3875 was cancelled and in lieu thereof Transfer Certificate  of Title No.  NT-12016 was issued in the name of Fidela R. Gomez, subject to the provisions of Section  4, Rule 74 of the  Rules of Court.</p>
<p>On July 29, 1952, herein  appellees Antonino, Filemon, and Nicomedes, all  surnamed Lazaro, claiming to be the heirs of Clemente Lazaro, who died  intestate in 1940, and invoking the  judgment rendered on October 15, 1938 in Civil Case No.  7725, filed an action before the Court of First Instance of Nueva  Ecija for  the annulment of the deed of extra-judicial settlement executed by Prudencio Anastacio's heirs and the  cancellation  of Original Certificate of Title  No.  3849 as well as Transfer Certificate of Title No. NT-12016 in the name of Fidela R. Gomez (Civil Case No. 1001).  On the other hand, upon discovering that Lot No.  3875,  which she purchased from the heirs of Prudencio Anastacio, was in the possession of herein appellees, Fidela R. Gomez filed in the same court an action against said  appellees for  the recovery of the said lot (Civil  Case No. 1006).</p>
<p>After joint trial of the cases above referred to, the court below,  on. August 6, 1955,  rendered a decision declaring the deed of extra-judicial settlement null and void  and ordering the  cancellation of  Original Certificate of Title No. 3849 in the name of Prudencio Anastacio and Transfer Certificate of Title  No. NT-12016 in the  name of  Fidela R.  Gomez.  In the same decision, the court dismissed the action  filed by  Fidela R. Gomez in Civil Case  No. 1006. From said decision, Fidela  R. Gomez and the heirs of Prudencio interposed the present appeal.</p>
<p>We find merit in the appeal.  Appellees' right of action, as  plaintiffs in Civil Case No^ l6oi,  is predicated upon the judgment in Civil Case No.  7725, which was rendered way back on October 15, 1938.   Indeed, their  action was  filed simply to enforce that judgment.  It is not disputed, however, that said  judgment has long become final, and  executory,  more than  10 years having elapsed before their action  to enforce it was filed on July 29, 1952.  It being the  rule  that an  action  upon a judgment can  only be brought within ten  years from the  date the judgment became final (Sec.  43, Code of Civil Procedure; Art. 1971, old Civil  Code; see also Sec. 6,  Rule 39, Rules of Court; Arts.  1144 and 1152, new Civil Code),  the  defense of prescription set up by herein appellants must be sustained. "If  eternal vigilance  is the  price  of safety,  one cannot sleep on one's right for more than a tenth of a century and  expect it to be preserved in its pristine purity."  (Associacion  Cooperativa de Credito Agricola de  Miagao w. Monteclaro, 74 Phil., 281.)</p>
<p>Having arrived at the above conclusion, we find it unnecessary to pass upon the other questions raised by the parties.</p>
<p>Wherefore,  the decision appealed from  is reversed  and defendants-appellees  in Civil Case No. 1006  are hereby ordered to vacate Lot No. 3875 and to surrender possession thereof to plaintiff-appellant Fidela R. Gomez.  So ordered without costs.</p>
