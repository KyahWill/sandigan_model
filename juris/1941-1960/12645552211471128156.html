				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 2, 1942, the defendant (a non-stock corporation) issued to  Iwao Teruyama Membership Certificate No. 201 which was assigned to M. T. Reyes on April  22, 1944.  Subsequently in the same  year  1944, M. T. Reyes transferred and assigned said certificate to the plaintiff. On April 26, 1955, the plaintiff filed an  action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the  defendant, alleging that shortly after the rehabilitation of the defendant after the war, the plaintiff asked the defendant to register in its books the assignment in favor of the plaintiff and to issue to the latter a new certificate, but that the defendant had  refused and still refuses to do so unlawfully; and praying that the plaintiff be declared the owner of one share of stock of the defendant and that the latter be ordered to issue a correspondent  new  certificate.  On  June 6, 1955, the defendant filed a motion to  dismiss, alleging that from 1944, when the plaintiff's right of  action had accrued, to April 26, 1955, when the complaint was filed, eleven years have  elapsed, and that therefore  the complaint was filed beyond the 5-year period fixed in Article 1149 of the Civil Code.  On  July 30, 1955,  the Court of First Instance of Manila issued an order dismissing the complaint. As plaintiff's motion for reconsideration filed on August 27, 1955 and second motion  for reconsideration  filed on  September 13, 1955,  were both denied,  the plaintiff  has  taken the present appeal. <br><br>The certificate in question  contains  a condition to the effect that no assignment  thereof "shall  be effective with respect to  the  club until such assignment is registered in the books of the club, as provided in the By-Laws."  The decisive question that arises is  whether  the plaintiff was bound, under said condition and By-Laws of the defendant or any statutory rule for that matter, to present and register the certificate assigned to him in  1944 within any definite  or fixed period.  The defendant has not made herein any pretense to that  effect; but it contends that from the moment the certificate was  assigned to the plaintiff,  the latter's right to have the assignment registered commenced to exist.  This contention is correct, but it would not follow that said  right should be exercised immediately or within a definite period.  The existence  of a right is one thing, and the duration of said right is another. <br><br>On the  other hand, it is stated  in the appealed  order of dismissal  that  the plaintiff sought to register the assignment on April 13,  1955;  whereas in plaintiff's brief it is alleged  that it was only in February,  1955, when  the defendant refused to recognize the plaintiff.  If, as already observed,  there is no  fixed period for registering an  assignment, how can  the complaint  be considered as already barred by the Statute  of Limitations when it was filed on April 26,  1955, or barely a few  days (according to  the lower court) and two months (according to the plaintiff), after the  demand for registration and  its denial by the defendant. Plaintiff's right was violated only sometime in 1955, and it could  not accordingly  have asserted any cause of action against the  defendant before  that. <br><br>The defendant seems to  believe that the plaintiff was compelled immediately to register his assignment.  Any such compulsion  is obviously for  the benefit of the plaintiff, because it is only  after  registration that the transfer would be binding against the defendant. But we are not here concerned with a situation where the plaintiff claims anything against the defendant allegedly accruing under the outstanding certificate in question between the date of the assignment to the  plaintiff and the date of the latters demand for registration and issuance of a new certificate. <br><br>The defendant has also  intimated property  holdings of Japanese nationals  were vested after the  liberation upon the Alien  Property Administration or Custodian;  that  the plaintiff should have thereupon registered the assignment to him  of Certificate No. 201  issued to Iwao Teruyama; and that in  the meantime rights to said certificate by their pre-war registered  American owners were filed with the defendant and correspondingly  acted upon.  These,  however, are matters which may  affect the validity  of the assignment to the plaintiff or his right to register the same constituting special defenses, but certainly have no bearing on the question of prescription. <br><br>Wherefore,  the appealed order is  hereby reversed and the  case  remanded to  the  court of origin for further proceedings.   So ordered with costs against the defendant. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,  A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.
