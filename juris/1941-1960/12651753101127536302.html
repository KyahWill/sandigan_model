				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendant&nbsp; Kamad&nbsp; Arinso was&nbsp; accused, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Cotabato,&nbsp; of illegal possession&nbsp; of a hand grenade.&nbsp; When the case was&nbsp; called for trial&nbsp; on the merits,&nbsp; on July 17, 1953, Arinso—then a detention prisoner,&nbsp; for failure to&nbsp; file&nbsp; a&nbsp; bail bond—with the leave of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court,&nbsp; withdraw his previous plea of&nbsp; not&nbsp; guilty and entered, in lieu thereof, that of guilty.&nbsp; Thereupon, applying&nbsp; the provisions of section 106&nbsp; of the Administrative Code for Mindanao&nbsp; and Sulu, and&nbsp; considering, in favor of&nbsp; the defendant, the mitigating&nbsp; circumstances of plea&nbsp; of guilty and lack of sufficient instruction,&nbsp; said court sentenced&nbsp; him to imprisonment for six (6) months, with the accessory penalties provided by law, and&nbsp; to pay the costs, apart from ordering&nbsp; the&nbsp; confiscation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; hand grenade&nbsp; aforementioned.&nbsp; The&nbsp; prosecution moved&nbsp; for a reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; sentence,&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that said&nbsp; section&nbsp; 106 should not have&nbsp; been applied,&nbsp; but the motion was&nbsp; denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the&nbsp; present&nbsp; appeal by the Government, upon the ground&nbsp; that:&nbsp; <ol><li>"The&nbsp; lower court erred in&nbsp; finding that at the&nbsp; time of filing the motion for reconsideration by the provincial fiscal, the appellee had already commenced serving the sentence imposed, and in denying said motion on the ground that the decision has become final.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>"The lower court erred in interpreting that the motion for reconsideration filed by the&nbsp; provincial fiscal was in effect a motion for new trial,&nbsp; and in denying said motion allegedly because to grant it for the&nbsp; purpose of raising the penalty would&nbsp; constitute double jeopardy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>"The lower court erred in considering in favor of the appellee the provisions of section 106 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu, and in sentencing him to six (6) months of imprisonment only."</li></ol><p>The first assignment of&nbsp; error need4 not be considered, for,&nbsp; even if&nbsp; it&nbsp; were well taken, the appeal is&nbsp; devoid&nbsp; of merit.&nbsp; What is more,&nbsp; it cannot even be entertained.</p><p>The Government maintains&nbsp; that the penalty meted out to the defendant&nbsp; is&nbsp; too light, inasmuch&nbsp; as&nbsp; said&nbsp; hand grenade had&nbsp; been used by him to commit&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; of robbery in band with homicide, with which he is charged in another case.&nbsp; However, under the provisions of section 106&nbsp; of&nbsp; said Administrative&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court had' discretion to impose said penalty,&nbsp; which, accordingly, cannot be assailed as erroneous, from&nbsp; the legal viewpoint.</p><p>More important still, the lower court admittedly had jurisdiction to render the decision appealed from, as well as over the&nbsp; subject&nbsp; matter of the&nbsp; case&nbsp; and. over the parties.&nbsp; Likewise, it is not disputed&nbsp; that&nbsp; the information&nbsp; against the accused is&nbsp; sufficient in form and in&nbsp; substance, and that he had been&nbsp; arraigned&nbsp; and had&nbsp; entered his plea prior to the rendition of said&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; In other words, he has already been placed in jeopardy of&nbsp; punishment for the&nbsp; offense charged in the lower court, and the appeal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution,&nbsp; with&nbsp; a view&nbsp; to urging an increase of his&nbsp; penalty, places him twice in jeopardy&nbsp; of punishment for said offense, as held&nbsp; in People <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Ang Cho&nbsp; Kio (95 Phil., 475, 50 Off. Gaz., 3563) and reiterated in People <em>vs.</em> Taruc (87 Phil., 927, decided&nbsp; November 28, 1955).</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; plaintiff's appeal is&nbsp; hereby dismissed,&nbsp; with costs <em>de oficio</em>.&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. L., </em>and <em>Endencia, JJ.,</em> concur.<br></p></div>
