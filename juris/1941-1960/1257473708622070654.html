				<H3>LINO P. BERNARDO, PETITIONER, VS. EUFEMIA PASCUAL, ET AL., AND WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION COMMISSION, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to review on certiorari a decision of the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission, awarding compensation to the widow and children of the 
deceased Pedro Pascual who met death as a result of an accident while felling a 
tree in petitioner's lumber concession.
<p>The record shows that on March 9, 1955, the deceased Pedro Pascual was, 
together with Rogelio Bacane and Martin Quinto, in the woods at Corona, San 
Miguel, Bulacan. Bacane and Quinto, both loggers admittedly in the employ of 
herein petitioner, were cutting timber, while fifty meters away from them the 
deceased was felling a tree which he had started hewing three days before. When 
Bacane and Quinto heard the sound of the falling tree—and following the practice 
among loggers—they shouted to Pascual to find out if he was alright. As the 
latter did not answer, they rushed to where he was and there found him prostrate 
on the ground with blood trickling from his mouth. Shortly thereafter, he died 
from a fractured skull and his companions took his body home in petitioner's 
truck.</p>
<p>On March 31, 1955, the widow of the deceased on behalf of herself and their 
children filed a claim for compensation with the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission. Originally filed against the Bernardo Sawmill, the claim was on 
February 6, 1956 amended to include herein petitioner Lino P. Bernardo, the 
timber concessionaire and owner and operator of the sawmill, as party 
respondent. In his answer, the latter denied that he was a timber concessionaire 
before October 13, 1955, or that he had an employer-employee relationship with 
the deceased. He also objected to the claim on the ground of prescription. The 
referee assigned to hear the case having denied the claim, the claimants 
petitioned for review. On August 27, 1957, the reviewing commissioner reversed 
the referee's decision and ordered Lino P. Bernardo to pay claimants P3,120.00 
as compensation, to reimburse them P200.00 for burial expenses and to pay to the 
Workmen's Compensation Fund P32.00 as fees. Reconsideration of this award having 
been denied, Lino P. Bernardo brought the present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>Petitioner first charges that the respondent Commission abused its discretion 
in reversing the decision of the referee and finding that the deceased was his 
employee. Petitioner, however has failed to substantiate the charge. On the 
other hand, Rogelio Bacane and Martin Quinto, whose employment with the 
petitioner was never denied and who were present and were working together with 
the deceased at the time the latter met his death, testified at the hearing of 
the case that the said deceased was their co-laborer in the lumber concession of 
petitioner Lino P. Bernardo. Indeed, the respondent Commission, expressly found 
that their testimonies "clearly point to the existence of an employer-employee 
relation between the respondent (herein petitioner) and the deceased." It also 
appears that the deceased, Bacane and Quinto used to receive their wages from 
Emilio Bautista, petitioner's "katiwala". As a matter of fact, the widow of the 
deceased received from said Bautista the wages corresponding to services last 
rendered by her husband. Petitioner claims that Bautista was a forest guard of 
the Government and was not his employee. This claim, however, loses its force 
when we consider the fact that forest guards hired by lumber concessionaires, 
though appointed by the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources (under 
Forestry Order No. 11), are still deemed employees of the concessionaires. 
(<em>See</em> Martha Lumber Mill <em>vs</em>. Lagradante, et al., 99 Phil., 434; 
52 Off. Gaz. [9] 4230.)</p>
<p>In disclaiming employer-employee relationship with the deceased, petitioner 
has made the rather reckless accusation that the said deceased was a "lumber 
smuggler" who had been stealing timber from the concession area. No explanation, 
however, was given why the deceased at the time of his death was felling a tree 
in broad daylight and in the presence of petitioner's two loggers. In this 
connection, we might add that the finding of the respondent Commission that the 
deceased was petitioner's employee at the time of his death is a finding of fact 
and there being no sufficient showing that the same is unsupported by 
substantial evidence, the same should be deemed final and conclusive upon this 
Court. (Madrigal Shipping Co. <em>vs</em>. Del Rosario, et al., G. R. No. 
L-13130, October 31, 1959; NLU <em>vs</em>. Sta. Ana, 101 Phil., 297; 54 Off. 
Gaz. [6] 1817; <em>see also</em> PAL <em>vs</em>. PAL Employees Association, G. 
R. No. L-8197, October 31, 1958; Donato <em>vs</em>. Phil. Marine Officers 
Association, G. R. No. L-12506, May 18, 1958; 15c and Up Employees' Association 
<em>vs</em>. Dept. and Bazaar Free Workers' Union, G. R. No. L-9168, October 18, 
1956; NLU <em>vs</em>. Dinglasan, 98 Phil., 649; 52 Off. Gaz. (4) 1933; Batangas 
Transportation Co. <em>vs</em>. Rivera and WCC, supra, p.175.)</p>
<p>Petitioner also argues that the claim was made out of time and therefore 
already barred because it was filed only on February 6, 1956. It will be 
recalled that claimants filed their original claim on March 31, 1955 against the 
Bernardo Sawmill, and on February 6, 1956, amended it to include petitioner Lino 
P. Bernardo as party respondent, it appearing that he was the owner and operator 
of the sawmill. It will thus be seen that in amending the claim, claimants 
merely specified the real party in interest in accordance with the rule that 
every action must be prosecuted in the name of such party in interest (Section 
2, Rule 3, Rules of Court). Since the amendment did not state a new cause of 
action but merely made more determinate the real party respondent, it evidently 
relates back to the date of the original complaint or claim, which was 
admittedly filed within the 3-month period from the death of the employee as 
fixed by tsection 24, of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>
<p>With respect to petitioner's claim that he became a lumber concessionaire 
only on October 13, 1955, suffice it to say that prior to that date, he was a 
partner to several persons owning the concession in San Miguel, Bulacan, and 
subsequent thereto, he acquired the interest of his partners and became the sole 
concessionaire. Under those circumstances he became liable to the creditors of 
the partnership. (Art. 1840, new Civil Code.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission sought to be 
reviewed is affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J. B. 
L., Barrera</em>, and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision affirmed</em>.</p></div>
