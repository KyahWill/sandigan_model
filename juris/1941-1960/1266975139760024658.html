				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken from the decision&nbsp; dated March 28,&nbsp; 1958 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance oi Manila&nbsp; (in Civil Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 3S940), denying petitioner's petition for the use of an&nbsp; alias name.<br><br>On&nbsp; October 7,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-mentioned court, a petition for the use of an alias name, to wit:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"PETITION <br></div><br>"COMES NOW&nbsp; the petitioner, by counsel, and&nbsp; to&nbsp; this Honorable court respectfully alleges:<br><br>"1. That he is of legal age, Chinese, married, residing at 962-A (Now 1854)&nbsp; Alvarado Extension, Manila, at which City he has been a <span style="font-style: italic;">bona fide</span> resident since 1925;<br><br>"2." That the petitioner's real&nbsp; name is Yu&nbsp; Khehg; the word Yu, in the Chinese language, being one and the&nbsp; same with Yang or Young, and symbolized by the same written character: <span style="font-style: italic;">Yu </span>being the pronounciation in the Amoy dialect; <span style="font-style: italic;">Yang </span>in the Cantonese dialect; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Young</span>, in the Mandarin dialect which is the national language of China;<br><br>"3.&nbsp; That for these reasons the petitioner has also been known as 'Young' or 'Kheng Chiau Young' to his Filipino and foreign friends and business colleagues; and accordingly, in his&nbsp; business and ordinary transactions, the petitioner has been signing his name as 'Kheng Chiau Young', Kheng C. Young', or simply 'K. C. Young', by which name, written in Occidental fashion, he has come to be better known and identified;<br><br>"4. That the signature and name: 'Kheng Chiau Young', or 'Kheng C. Young', is found by the petitioner not&nbsp; only necessary for better identification, but also more convenient for business&nbsp; purposes in the Philippines where the occidental way of signing is practiced;<br><br>"5. That the&nbsp; petitioner further&nbsp; desires&nbsp; to comply with the strict letter of&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 142.<br><br>"WHEREFORE,&nbsp; it is respectfully prayed&nbsp; that the petitioner be authorized by this&nbsp; Honorable Court,&nbsp; pursuant to law,&nbsp; to use and employ the alias 'Kheng Chiau Young', as well as any of the Occidental forms thereof, to wit:&nbsp; 'Kheng C. Young' or 'K. C. Young', and sign himself in such manner or&nbsp; style."<br></blockquote>After&nbsp; due publication of the petition and order of hearing and after receiving evidence, the court on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 28,. 1958 rendered a decision which,&nbsp; in part, reads:<br><blockquote>"The Court understands the predicament of the&nbsp; petitioner; but it is not disposed to grant his petition.&nbsp; It may be true as petitioner says that in China, Young is the same as Yu so that Kheng Chiau Young is the same as Yu Kheng Chiau; but in the Philippines, Yu is not Young,&nbsp; To grant&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition would be to add more confusion. More than that, the Court gathers from&nbsp; petitioner's evidence that he intends to reside permanently in the Philippines;&nbsp; the Court takes this from the fact that he has initiated a petition for naturalization; this being the case, it is only proper that he follow the Filipino way of using&nbsp; only one name; if he believes that it would be better for him to write his&nbsp; name following the Occidental method, he can easily file a petition for change of name, so that in lieu of the name, Yu Kheng&nbsp; Chiau" he can,&nbsp; abandoning the same, ask for authority&nbsp; to adopt the name 'Kheng Chiau Young.'<br><br>"In view whereof, denied."<br></blockquote>Petitioner's&nbsp; motion for reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; said decision filed on&nbsp; April 24, 1958 having been denied,&nbsp; he appealed to us on May 22, 1958.<br><br>Petitioner, in this instance, claims that the lower court erred in denying his petition for the use of an alias name, on the grounds stated in the&nbsp; decision above-quoted.<br><br>We&nbsp; do not&nbsp; agree with petitioner.&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 2 of Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 142 provides that "Any person desiring to use an alias or aliases shall apply for authority therefor in proceedings like those legally provided to obtain judicial authority for&nbsp; a change of name" under Rule 103 of the Rules of Court,&nbsp; which states in Section 5, as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Judgment</span>.â€”Upon satisfactory proof in&nbsp; open court on the date fixed in the order that&nbsp; such&nbsp; order&nbsp; has been published as directed and that&nbsp; the allegations of the petition are true, the court shall, if proper&nbsp; and reasonable cause&nbsp; appears&nbsp; for change the name of the petitioner, adjudge that such name be changed in accordance with the prayer&nbsp; of the petition."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Under this&nbsp; provision,&nbsp; a petitioner&nbsp; seeking the&nbsp; change of his name or the use of an alias name, as in the&nbsp; instant case, must&nbsp; show to the satisfaction of&nbsp; the court&nbsp; "proper and&nbsp; reasonable" grounds, in&nbsp; order to&nbsp; entitle him to the grant of his petition.&nbsp; An order granting&nbsp; or denying the petition is a matter of judicial discretion, not of right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><blockquote>"Such a petitioner is required,&nbsp; among other things, to state the is no statutory duty resting on the district court to make the order demanded except:<br><br>Upon being duly satisfied, by proof in open court, of the truth of the allegations&nbsp; set forth in the petition, and that there exists proper and&nbsp; reasonable cause&nbsp; for changing the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioner.'<br><br>"Proof of proper and reasonable&nbsp; cause sufficient to&nbsp; satisfy&nbsp; the district court is&nbsp; a condition of the statutory relief.&nbsp; At common law a man may change his name any time; but in this state, if he desires a&nbsp; judicial record thereof, he&nbsp; must adduce&nbsp; evidence to&nbsp; satisfy&nbsp; the court that there is sufficient&nbsp; and reasonable cause&nbsp; for the change. In exercising the power&nbsp; to change names the district court is&nbsp; not subject to the whims of every petitioner.&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; Under the statute requiring&nbsp; sufficient and reasonable cause for a change&nbsp; of&nbsp; name,&nbsp; a decree is not a matter of right, but of judicial discretion. Sufficient and&nbsp; reasonable cause&nbsp; for changing&nbsp; the name of petitioner has&nbsp; not been&nbsp; shown."&nbsp;&nbsp; (In re Taminosien, 97 Neb.&nbsp; 514;&nbsp; 150&nbsp; N.W.&nbsp; 824; Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>There can hardly be any doubt that petitioner's use of the alias&nbsp; "Kheng Chiau Young"&nbsp; in&nbsp; addition to his real name "Yu Kheng&nbsp; Chiau" would&nbsp; add to more&nbsp; confusion. That&nbsp; he&nbsp; is known&nbsp; in his&nbsp; business, as&nbsp; manager&nbsp; of the Robert&nbsp; Reid, Inc. by&nbsp; the former name, is&nbsp; not. sufficient reason to&nbsp; allow him its use.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, petitioner admitted that he is known to his associates by both names.&nbsp; In fact, the Anselmo Trinidad, Inc., of which&nbsp; he is a customer, knows him by&nbsp; his&nbsp; real name.&nbsp; Neither would the fact that he had encountered certain difficulties in his transactions with governments offices, which required him to explain&nbsp; why he bore two names, justify&nbsp; the&nbsp; grant&nbsp; of his petition, for petitioner could easily avoid&nbsp; said&nbsp; difficulties by simply&nbsp; using&nbsp; and sticking only to his real name "Yu Kheng Chiau." &nbsp;<br><br>The fact that petitioner intends to reside permanently in the Philippines, as shown by his having filed a petition for&nbsp; naturalization in Branch V&nbsp; of the above-mentioned court, argues the more against the grant, of his petition, because&nbsp; if&nbsp; naturalized as a Filipino citizen, there&nbsp; would then be no necessity for his further using said alias, as it would be contrary to the usual Filipino way and practice of using only one name in&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as business transactions.&nbsp; And,&nbsp; as&nbsp; the lower court correctly observed, if he believes (after he is naturalized)&nbsp; that it would be better&nbsp; for&nbsp; him to write his name following the Occidental method,&nbsp; "he can easily file a petition for change of&nbsp; name, so that&nbsp; in lieu&nbsp; of the name 'Yu&nbsp; Kheng Chiau', he&nbsp; can, abandoning the&nbsp; same, ask for authority to adopt the name 'Kheng Chiau Young'".<br><br>All things considered,&nbsp; we&nbsp; are&nbsp; of the opinion and so hold, that&nbsp; petitioner has not&nbsp; shown satisfactorily proper and&nbsp; reasonable grounds under the&nbsp; aforequoted provisions of Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. 142 and the&nbsp; Rules of Court, to warrant the&nbsp; grant of his&nbsp; petition for the use of an alias name.<br><br>Wherefore, finding no error&nbsp; in the judgment of the court <i>a quo</i>, we hereby affirm the same, with costs against the petitioner-appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur. &nbsp;<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In re Ross, 67 P. 2d&nbsp; 94, 8 Cal. 2d 608, 110 ALR&nbsp; 217;&nbsp; In re Useldinger, 96 P. 2d. 958, 35 Cal.
