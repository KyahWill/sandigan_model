				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Anastacio Viana owned&nbsp; the&nbsp; fishing sailboat "Magkapatid", which, in the night of September 3, 1948, sunk in the waters&nbsp; between&nbsp; the&nbsp; province of Bataan and the&nbsp; island&nbsp; of&nbsp; Corregidor,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a consequence of&nbsp; a collision with the USS "Tingles", a&nbsp; vessel of the U.S. Navy,&nbsp; In asmuch as Alejandro Al-Lagadan, a&nbsp; member of the crew of the&nbsp; "Magkapatid",&nbsp; disappeared&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; craft,&nbsp; his parents, respondent Ale jo Al-Lagadan and Filomena Piga, filed the corresponding claim for compensation under Act No 3428.&nbsp; After appropriate proceedings,&nbsp; a Referee&nbsp; of the Workmen's Compensation Commission rendered a decision, dated February&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1953:&nbsp; <blockquote><p>"1. Ordering Mr.&nbsp; Anastacio Viaiia to pay the above-named claimants through the Workmen's Compensation Commission, Manila, the sum of P1,560 in lump sum with interest at 6 per cent from September 3,&nbsp; 1948 until fully paid; and&nbsp; </p><p>"To pay the sum&nbsp; of P16&nbsp; to the Workmen's Compensation Commission as costs."</p></blockquote><p>Said decision was, on petition for review filed by Viana, affirmed&nbsp; by the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner, on&nbsp; or about October&nbsp; 22, 1954, "with&nbsp; additional&nbsp; fee&nbsp; of P5.00".&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Commissioner, having subsequently denied a reconsideration&nbsp; of this&nbsp; action,&nbsp; Viana&nbsp; has&nbsp; brought&nbsp; the matter to us, for review by certiorari, upon the ground that this case&nbsp; does not&nbsp; fall within the purview of Act No. 3428, because the gross income&nbsp; of his&nbsp; business&nbsp; for the year 1947 was allegedly less than P10,000, and because Alejandro Al-Lagadan was,&nbsp; at the time of his death,&nbsp; His (petitioner's)&nbsp; industrial&nbsp; partner, not his employee.</p><p>The first ground is untenable, petitioner not having invoked it before the rendition of the Referee's&nbsp; decision on February 23,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp; The objection to the application&nbsp; of Act No.&nbsp; 3428,&nbsp; upon said ground, was made&nbsp; for&nbsp; the first time when .petitioner sought a review of said decision&nbsp; by the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commissioner.&nbsp; The non-applicability of said Act to&nbsp; employers whose&nbsp; gross income does not reach P20,000 is, however, a matter, of defense, which cannot be availed of unless pleaded in the employer's answer to the claim for compensation filed by&nbsp; the employee or his heirs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner herein having failed to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so, said&nbsp; defense&nbsp; may not&nbsp; now be&nbsp; entertained&nbsp; (Rolan&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Perez, 63 Phil.,&nbsp; 80, 85-86).</p><p>As&nbsp; regards&nbsp; the second ground,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; maintains, contrary to the finding of the Referee and said&nbsp; Commissioner, that the deceased was his industrial partner, not employee.&nbsp; In this connection, it is alleged in paragraph (6)&nbsp; of the&nbsp; petition:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"That&nbsp; the&nbsp; practice&nbsp; observed then&nbsp; and now in&nbsp; engaging&nbsp; the services of crewmen of sailboats plying between Mindoro and Manila is on a partnership basis, to wit: that the owner&nbsp; of the&nbsp; vessel, on one hand receives one-half of the earnings of the&nbsp; sailboat after deducting&nbsp; the expenses&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; maintenance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crew,&nbsp; the other half is divided pro rata among' the members, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crew, the&nbsp; 'patron'&nbsp; or&nbsp; captain receiving&nbsp; four&nbsp; parts,&nbsp; the 'piloto' or next in command&nbsp; three parts, the wheelsman or 'timonel'&nbsp; 1 1/2&nbsp; parts and the&nbsp; rest of the members of the crew&nbsp; one part each, as per&nbsp; Annex 'B' hereof."</p></blockquote><p>It&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that,&nbsp; before rendering' his aforementioned decision, the Referee requested&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; O.&nbsp; Morente, an&nbsp; attorney of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Commission, "to look into and inquire and determine&nbsp; the method of and the basis of&nbsp; engaging&nbsp; the services of crewmen for sailboats&nbsp; (batel)&nbsp; of&nbsp; twenty&nbsp; (20)&nbsp; tons&nbsp; or more&nbsp; plying between Manila and Mariveles and&nbsp; moored along Manila North Harbor", and that, thereafter, said Atty.&nbsp; Morente reported:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; basis of&nbsp; engaging the services&nbsp; of crewmen of a&nbsp; batel is determined in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with the&nbsp; contract executed between the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; and the patron.&nbsp; The contract commonly followed is on a share basis after deducting all the expenses incurred on&nbsp; the voyage.&nbsp; One&nbsp; half goes to the owner&nbsp; of the batel and&nbsp; the&nbsp; other half&nbsp; goes to the patron and the members of the crew and divided among themselves on a share basis also&nbsp; in accordance with their agreement with the patron getting the lion's&nbsp; share. The&nbsp; hiring of the crew is done by&nbsp; the patron&nbsp; himself.&nbsp; Usually, when a patron enters into a&nbsp; contract with the owner of&nbsp; the batel, he has a crew ready with him."&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>In sustaining the Referee's finding to the effect&nbsp; that the&nbsp; deceased was an employee of Viaña, the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner&nbsp; said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"The trial&nbsp; referee found that there&nbsp; was&nbsp; an employer-employee relation between the respondent and the deceased, Alejandro Al-Lagadan, and the share which the deceased received at the end of each trip&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; nature&nbsp; of&nbsp; 'wages' which&nbsp; is&nbsp; defined&nbsp; under section 39&nbsp; of the Compensation Act.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is so because such share could be reckoned in terms of money.&nbsp; In other words, there existed the relation of employer and employee between the&nbsp; respondent and Alejandro .Al-Lagadan at the&nbsp; time of the latter's death.&nbsp; </p><p>"We. believe that the trial referee did&nbsp; not err&nbsp; in finding the deceased an employee of the respondent.&nbsp; We cite the following cases which&nbsp; illustrate the point at issue:&nbsp; </p><p>The officers&nbsp; and crews&nbsp; of whaling and&nbsp; other&nbsp; fishing vessels who are&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive certain proportions of produce of the voyage in lieu of wages;&nbsp; (Rice <em>vs.</em> Austin, 17 Mass. 206; 2Y &amp; C. 61); Captains&nbsp; of. merchant ships who,,&nbsp; instead&nbsp; of&nbsp; wages, receive&nbsp; shares in the profits of the adventure; (4 Maule &amp;&nbsp; C. 240); or who take&nbsp; vessels under&nbsp; an agreement&nbsp; to pay certain&nbsp; charges&nbsp; and receive a&nbsp; share&nbsp; of&nbsp; the earnings;&nbsp; (Tagard <em>vs.</em> Loring,&nbsp; 16 Mass. 336, 8 Am. Dec. 140; Winsor <em>vs.</em> Cutts, 7 Greenl. Me. 261) have generally been held not to be partners with the respondent, and&nbsp; the like. Running&nbsp; a&nbsp; steamboat on shares does not make the owners partners&nbsp; in respect to the vessel (The Daniel&nbsp; Koine,&nbsp; 35&nbsp; Fed.&nbsp; 785); so of an&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; between&nbsp; two&nbsp; parties to&nbsp; farm on shares; (Hooloway <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Brinkley, 42 Ga. 226);&nbsp; A seaman who&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp; receive pay in proportion to the amount of fish caught is not a partner;&nbsp; (Holdren <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; French,&nbsp; 68 Me. 241);&nbsp; sharing profits in&nbsp; lieu of wages&nbsp; is&nbsp; not a&nbsp; partnership.&nbsp; There&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; no true contribution;&nbsp; (Crawford&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Austin, 34&nbsp; Md. 49; Whitehill <span style="font-style: italic;">vs,&nbsp;</span> Shickle, 43&nbsp; Mo. 538;&nbsp; Sankey&nbsp; <em>vs.</em> Iron Works, 44&nbsp; Ga. 228.)'"&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied.)</p></blockquote><p>In other words, in the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; of the Referee,&nbsp; as well as&nbsp; of said Commissioner, the mere&nbsp; fact that Alejandro's share in the understanding "could be&nbsp; reckoned in terms of&nbsp; money", sufficed to characterize him&nbsp; as&nbsp; an employee of Viaña.&nbsp; We&nbsp; do not&nbsp; share this view.&nbsp; Neither can we accept, however, petitioner's theory to&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect that&nbsp; the deceased was his partner, not an employee, simply&nbsp; because he (the deceased) shared in the profits, not&nbsp; in&nbsp; the losses. In&nbsp; determining&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of&nbsp; employer-employee relationship, the following elements are generally considered, namely: (1)&nbsp; the selection and engagement of the employee; (2)&nbsp; the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; the power to control the&nbsp; employees' conduct— although the latter is the most important element (35 Am. Jur. 445).&nbsp; Assuming&nbsp; that the&nbsp; share&nbsp; received by&nbsp; the deceased could partake of the nature of&nbsp; wages—on which we need not, and&nbsp; do not, express&nbsp; our view—and&nbsp; that the second element, therefore, exists in the case at bar, the record does not contain any specific&nbsp; data regarding the third&nbsp; and fourth elements.</p><p>With respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the first element, the facts before&nbsp; us are insufficient&nbsp; to&nbsp; warrant a&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; conclusion, one way or the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the one hand, Atty. Morente said, in his aforementioned report, that "the contract commonly followed is on a&nbsp; share basis.&nbsp; * *&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; The hiring of a crew is done by the&nbsp; patron himself.&nbsp; Usually,&nbsp; when a&nbsp; patron enters into&nbsp; a contract&nbsp; with the&nbsp; owner of the batel,&nbsp; he has a&nbsp; crew ready&nbsp; with him".&nbsp;&nbsp; This statement suggests that the members&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crew are chosen by the patron, seemingly, upon his sole responsibility and authority.&nbsp; It is noteworthy,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; report&nbsp; referred to&nbsp; a practice commonly and "usually" observed in a given place. The record&nbsp; is silent&nbsp; on&nbsp; whether&nbsp; such practice had been followed in the case under consideration.&nbsp; More important still, the language&nbsp; used in said report may be construed as intimating,&nbsp; not only, that&nbsp; the&nbsp; "patron"&nbsp; selects and engages the&nbsp; crew,&nbsp; but,&nbsp; also,&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; members thereof are subject&nbsp; to his control and may&nbsp; be dismissed by him. To&nbsp; put it&nbsp; differently, the literal import&nbsp; of said&nbsp; report is open to the conclusion&nbsp; that the crew has a&nbsp; contractual relation, not with the owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the vessel, but with&nbsp; the patron, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the latter,&nbsp; not the&nbsp; former, is either their employer or their partner.</p><p>Upon the other&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; the very allegations of the petition show otherwise, for petitioner explicitly averred there in&nbsp; that&nbsp; the deceased&nbsp; Alejandro Al-Lagadan&nbsp; was&nbsp; his "industrial partner".&nbsp; This implies that a contract of partnership existed between them and that, accordingly, if the crew was selected and engaged by the "patron", the latter did so merely as agent or representative of petitioner here in.&nbsp; Again,&nbsp; if&nbsp; petitioner were&nbsp; a partner&nbsp; of the&nbsp; crew members, then&nbsp; neither the&nbsp; former nor the patron could control&nbsp; or dismiss the latter.</p><p>In the interest of justice and equity, and&nbsp; considering that a decision&nbsp; on the merits of the issue before us may establish an&nbsp; important precedent, it would be better to remand the case to the&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation Commission for further evidence and findings on the following questions: (17&nbsp; who selected the crew of the&nbsp; "Magkapatid" and engaged their services;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; if selected and&nbsp; engaged by the "patron", did the latter act in his own name and for his&nbsp; own account, or on behalf and for the account of Viaña;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; could Viana have&nbsp; refused to&nbsp; accept&nbsp; any of the crew members chosen and&nbsp; engaged by the "patron"; (4) did&nbsp; petitioner have&nbsp; authority to determine the time when, the place where and/or&nbsp; the manner&nbsp; or conditions in or under&nbsp; which the crew would&nbsp; work;&nbsp; and (5) who could&nbsp; dismiss its members.</p><p>Wherefore, let the case be remanded to the Workmen's Compensation Commission, for further proceedings in conformity with this decision,&nbsp; without special pronouncement as to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.
