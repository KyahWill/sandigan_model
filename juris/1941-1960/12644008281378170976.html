				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a dispute over the ownership of a piece of land left by
Elias Naval, who died on January 1, 1942. The dispute is between the
surviving children of the deceased's first marriage on the one hand and
his widow and surviving children of the second marriage on the other.
<p>It appears that Elias Naval married his first wife, Dorotea
Malanyaon, in 1888. He had 11 children with her but only two of
them—Francisco and Concepcion—survived, the others having died in
infancy. Dorotea died in 1908, and in 1912 Elias married his second
wife, Dolores Jonsay. With her he had three children: Serafin, Jose,
and one who died in childhood.</p>
<p>During the existence of the first marriage, Elias Naval took
possession of the land in question and commenced to cultivate it in a
small scale; but it was not until 1917, that is, nine years after the
death of his first wife, that he applied for a free patent therefor. At
that time he was already married to his second wife. On February 10,
1925, the application was approved by the Director of Lands who, on
that same day, ordered applicant's entry to be recorded in his name.
Then on August 29, 1928 a free patent was issued to applicant, who,
upon the patent being registered, received Original Certificate of
Title No. 346 from the register of deeds for the province.</p>
<p>As the occupation and cultivation of the land began during the first
marriage but title thereto was applied for and granted during the
second marriage, the question arose as to whether the land should
belong to the first conjugal partnership or to the second. To settle
the question the surviving children of the first marriage, claiming
that the land should belong to them, instituted the present action in
the Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur against the widow and the
surviving children of the second marriage, who on their part claim that
the land belongs to the second conjugal partnership. Upon hearing the
cause the court decided in favor of defendants, whereupon plaintiffs
appealed to the Court of Appeals, but that court has endorsed the case
here on the ground that the questions raised are purely legal.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs-appellants' position is that the patent granted to Elias
Naval is a mere confirmation of a vested right acquired since 1907
through continuous possession and cultivation of the land in question.
The trial judge, after analyzing the applicable sections of the Public
Land Law, held that mere possession and cultivation since 1907 does not
give the entry man a vested right to the land. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"El Juzgado, sin embargo, del analysis de los
terminos en que estan concebidos dichos articulos, es de opinion que
Elias Naval, per su posesion y cultivo interrumpidos desde el afio
1907, solo tuvo un derecho para obtener titulo gratuito sobre el
terreno en litigio de acuerdo con el articulo 41; y dicho derecho era
entonces imperfecto o incoativo, porque dependia de una contingencia
posterior, cual es el resultado de la investigacion que mas despues
practico el Director de Terrenos tal como se ordena en el art. 43.
Aquel derecho solo se quedo establecido y se convertio en real,
perfecto y absolute cuando, despues de la investigacion practicada el
efecto, el Director de Terrenos dicto el 10 de Febrero de 1925 la
orden. de expedicion del titulo. En este momento fue cuando Elias Naval
Be hizo dueno del terreno en cuestion y tuvo un <em>derecho adquirido</em> sobre el mismo, que se patentizo y se hizo efectivo mediante la expedicion del correspondiente titulo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are inclined to agree with the view taken by the lower court.
Occupation and cultivation of the land in question since 1907
unquestionably gave Elias Naval the right to apply for a free patent
therefor under the provisions of the Public Land Law. But in order that
that right might ripen into a free patent title, it was necessary,
among other things, that an application be actually filed. Without this
requisite no such title could be acquired, so that if Elias Naval had
never filed his application, he could have acquired no right of
ownership which he could transmit to his heirs. As was said in a case,
it is an erroneous theory, adopted by some courts, that the entryman
acquired an equitable title piecemeal, or on the installment plan,
until he earned a perfect or complete title by having complied with all
the conditions prerequisite to obtaining a patent. The entryman in fact
acquired nothing until the instant he was entitled to everything. If
his compliance with the statutory conditions fell short in any
essential, he had nothing, but the instant he had fully complied with
them, the equitable estate burst into full blossom as his property, and
simultaneously therewith he acquired the right to a patent. (Petition
of S. R. A. Inc., 18 NW 2d 447, 449.)</p>
<p>While no case directly in point has been found, the following from American Jurisprudence is illuminating:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The rights and interests of the spouses in land
acquired from the United States are governed by the Federal laws until
the title thereto is completed by the issuance of a patent and, thereafter, the state laws control the determination of whether the land is
separate or community property. Hence, in order that a right to such
land initiated during coverture but not consummated until the
dissolution of the marriage shall fall into the community, it is
necessary that it should have proceeded beyond a mere occupancy or
possessory right and arisen to the dignity of ownership!.; In respect
of lands acquired under the Federal Homestead Act, upon the death of
one spouse after the initiation but before the completion of the right
to the homestead, the survivor acquires the absolute title thereto as
his separate property free from any community interest under the laws
of the state, especially where "the Homestead entry was commuted by the
survivor; after the death of the other spouse. <em>Where the wife is
divorced after Tier husband's entry on the land but before the
completion of his right to the homestead, she acquires no interest in
the property. Where the entry was made before marriage and the patent
was issued afterwards, the land is the separate property of the entryman</em>.
But where the title was initiated and the patent was issued during the
existence of the marriage, the land is community property." (11 Am.
Jur. 193, citing McCune <em>vs.</em> Essig, 199 U. S. 362;<em> italics supplied</em>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we are with the trial court in holding
that the land in question belongs to the second conjugal partnership,
so that one-half of it should pertain to Elias Naval's second wife,
while the other half, which corresponds to the deceased Elias Naval,
should be divided equally among his surviving children: Francisco,
Concepcion, Serafin, and Jose, all surnamed Naval. And it being
understood that the shares of the children shall be subject to the
usufruct of the surviving spouse as provided by law, the judgment
appealed from is affirmed, without special pronouncement as to costs.</p>
