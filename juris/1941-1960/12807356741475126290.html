				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>In June 1945 the plaintiff Dolores F. Alberto was the owner of a 
parcel of land with improvements in San Juan, Rizal.  On the 21st of 
that month she sold it for twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) to 
defendant Tan C. Sing, whose wife is the other defendant Dee Bun.  On 
April 7, 1947, Tan C. Sing conveyed the same property to Alexandra Y. de
 Pascual married to Ramon Pascual, Filipino citizen, for the purchase 
price of P24,000.
  <p>    On January 8, 1948 Dolores F. Alberto commenced this litigation
 against the Sing spouses to annul the sale, upon the ground that they 
were Chinese citizens, disqualified by the Constitution from acquiring 
private agricultural lands.</p>
  <p>    Ramon Pascual with his wife intervened to defend the legality 
of his acquisition.</p>
  <p>    After hearing the parties, the court of first instance of 
Manila annulled both transfers holding that under our Krivenko decision 
Tan C. Sing had acquired no right to the land and conveyed none to the 
Pascual spouses.</p>
  <p>    The latter appealed, maintaining that even if the sale by 
Alberto to Sing violated the Constitution, the seller could not recover 
the property thus sold, especially, because the property had been 
subsequently transferred to Filipino citizens.  Their attorneys maintain
 that when a foreigner acquires land in violation of the Organic Act, he
 may hold such land against all persons, except the State.  And until 
the State takes action, the alien "may dispose of his interest either by
 conveyance or devise and his grantees or devises will thereupon acquire
 title notwithstanding his alienage." (2 C. J. 1053)</p>
  <p>    This appeal may be disposed of without enunciating the 
governing principle where proceedings are instituted by the State.  For 
the present it is enough to apply the ruling we have recently 
promulgated to the effect that the seller of reality to a Chinese 
citizen has no right to recover his property and annul the sale invoking
 the Krivenko decision, both parties being, in the eyes of the law, in 
pari delicto <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>.  
Consequently it was error for the trial judge to permit Dolores Alberto 
to recover the property she had sold in 1945.  The fact that Tan C. Sing
 and Dee Bun have not appealed is no obstacle to this pronouncement, 
they being nominal parties, the real parties affected being the 
intervenors-appellants.</p>
  <p>The appealed decision will therefore be reversed, and the complaint
 dismissed with costs.  So ordered.</p>

  <p><strong>PABLO, M.:</strong></p>
  <p> La venta hecha por Dolores F. Alberto a Tan C. Sing es nula 
(Krivenko <i>contra</i> Registrador de Titulos, 44 Gac. Of., 485).  
Siendo nula la venta, Tan C. Sing no adquirio legalmente el terreno, 
tampoco puede venderlo legalmente a Alexandre Y de Pascual.</p>
  <p>    Opino que la demandante puede recuperar el terreno vendido 
mediante devolucion de precio (Art. 1303, Cod. Civ. Español) "para 
restablecer la virtualidad de la prohibicion" constitutional.  
(Sentencia del Tribunal Supremo de España de 11 de abril de 1894).
