				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In&nbsp; the early part of June, 1952, the Philippine American General Insurance Company, Inc., PHILAMGEN for short, a private corporation engaged in the&nbsp; insurance business in the Philippines, was approached by Epifanio J. Alano to give&nbsp; a&nbsp; bond to&nbsp; guarantee the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of a&nbsp; loan of P25,000 which&nbsp; he was seeking&nbsp; to&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; from&nbsp; Antonio I. Roque.&nbsp; In consideration of the issuance of the bond, Alano offered to execute with his wife&nbsp; in favor of PHILAMGEN a first mortgage on three (3) parcels&nbsp; of land which were&nbsp; covered by&nbsp; Torrens&nbsp; titles.&nbsp; In&nbsp; order that PHILAMGEN may&nbsp; be in a position to consider&nbsp; Alanos application, it asked C. M. Hoskin &amp; Co., Inc., HOSKINS for short, to conduct an ocular inspection&nbsp; of said&nbsp; three parcels of land and to submit an appraisal report thereon.<br><br>On June 20, 1952, HOSKINS&nbsp; submitted its appraisal report, together with a document purporting to be a location&nbsp; plan for the property, wherein the following representations appeared: (<i>a</i>) that&nbsp; the property&nbsp; was within twenty-six (26) kilometers from the City of Manila; (b) that the property was&nbsp; accessible by regular bus service; and (c) that the property was at least ¾&nbsp; productive and had a fair valuation of at least&nbsp; P43,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Relying on this appraisal&nbsp; report, the&nbsp; PHILAMGEN issued&nbsp; on June 23, 1952, a bond for P25,000 in&nbsp; behalf of Alano and his wife, in favor of Antonio I. Roque, to secure the payment of a&nbsp; promissory note for&nbsp; the same&nbsp; amount executed by the Alanos in favor of Roque on&nbsp; June 23, 1952.&nbsp; In turn, the Alanos executed a first mortgage on the three parcels of land in favor of PHILAMGEN, but because the register of deeds&nbsp; of Bulacan refused to register the mortgage because the property had&nbsp; been originally acquired as&nbsp; a homestead and could not be mortgage to a private&nbsp; corporation such as&nbsp; PHILAMGEN, an arrangement was made whereby Miguel&nbsp; Campos,&nbsp; PHILAMGEN's president, became the mortgagee of the property, thus facilitating the registration of the&nbsp; mortgage in the office of the&nbsp; register of deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Campos, however, executed in favor of PHILAMGEN an indemnity agreement in behalf of the Alanos.<br><br>The Alanos failed to pay&nbsp; the promissory note to&nbsp; Antonio I. Roque, who thereupon made demand for payment upon PHILAMGEN pursuant to its bond, and accordingly PHILAMGEN paid to Roque on October 4, 1952, Alanos' obligation amounting to P25,000.&nbsp; After&nbsp; Roque was paid, Campos instituted an action in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan for the foreclosure of Alanos' mortgage,&nbsp; which in due time was decided against the Alanos, the&nbsp; Court decreeing the foreclosure of the mortgage.&nbsp; After the decision had become final, the&nbsp; provincial sheriff sold at&nbsp; public auction the three parcels of land covered by the mortgage, the same having been awarded to Campos as the highest bidder for the sum of P10,000.&nbsp; And&nbsp; by virtue of the sale executed by the provincial sheriff, the register of deeds issued new certificates of title in the name of Campos in lieu of those originally issued&nbsp; in the name of&nbsp; Alanos, which were in due course cancelled.<br><br>After obtaining title to&nbsp; the aforesaid three parcels of land, Campos sought to take possession of them and for this purpose&nbsp; he asked&nbsp; Antonio Varias, Hoskins'&nbsp; vice-president, who had prepared and submitted the&nbsp; appraisal report, to accompany him and indicate the location of said three parcels of land.&nbsp; Varias agreed to do so, but&nbsp; after motoring&nbsp; to Novaliches with Campos, Rodis, manager of PHILAMGEN's Bonding Department,&nbsp; and one Jose Florentino Varias was tmable to indicate any of the three parcels, although the entire area mentioned in the&nbsp; appraisal report had been covered.&nbsp; Varias gave us an excuse for his inability that&nbsp; when he had&nbsp; inspected the&nbsp; property&nbsp; as pointed to him by Alano, there was then a marker which served as&nbsp; an identification mark but which could&nbsp; no longer be found when he made the&nbsp; trip with Campos and his other companions.&nbsp; After several attempts to have Varias locate the&nbsp; property&nbsp; had failed, Varias referred Campos&nbsp; to&nbsp; a realtor by the name of&nbsp; Ildefonso,&nbsp; who promised&nbsp; to look for someone who know the&nbsp; location&nbsp; of the property.&nbsp; Ildefonso made an attempt to&nbsp; locate the&nbsp; property, and when he failed, Campos, upon Ildefonso's recommendation, engaged&nbsp; the services of&nbsp; surveyor&nbsp; Pedro Bundang.&nbsp; As&nbsp; a result of his work, Bundang was able to indicate to Campos the property in question and submitted a plan showing the location of the&nbsp; three parcels&nbsp; of land in relation to the Manila-Novaliches-Ipo road.<br><br>In view of glaring discrepancies existing between the appraisal&nbsp; report of Varias&nbsp; and the findings made by the surveyor hired by Campos to locate&nbsp; the property which show that the&nbsp; representations&nbsp; made by Varias&nbsp; in his report were inaccurate and false, the PHILAMGEN and Manuel Campos filed the present action on July&nbsp; 26, 1954, against HOSKINS seeking to recover P50,000 as&nbsp; damages, and&nbsp; rMO,000&nbsp; as attorney's&nbsp; fees&nbsp; and other incidental expenses.<br><br>Defendant, in its answer, set up the following defense: "That plaintiff sent Epifanio Alano to defendant,&nbsp; with a plan of the property to be appraised&nbsp; by defendant;&nbsp; and that the appraisal of the property in question made by the defendant, as set forth in its report * * * was based upon the information that plaintiff told&nbsp; defendant that&nbsp; said Epifanio Alano&nbsp; would give, in&nbsp; fact, gave to defendant, and upon study made&nbsp; by defendant of the facts, to the best of defendant's knowledge."&nbsp; Defendant&nbsp; set up&nbsp; a counterclaim for damages and attorney's fees in the aggregate amount of P60,000.<br><br>After&nbsp; both&nbsp; plaintiffs and&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; had&nbsp; submitted testimonial and documentary evidence, the Court rendered decisions,&nbsp; absolving defendant-from plaintiffs' complaint, but dismissing&nbsp; defendant's counterclaim, without&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp; as to&nbsp; costs.&nbsp; Both&nbsp; parties appealed&nbsp; in&nbsp; due time, plaintiffs in view pf the dismissal of their complaint,. and defendant because of the dismissal of its counterclaim, and the case was taken directly to this Court because the amount in litigation involves more than P50,000.<br><br>The appraisal&nbsp; report,&nbsp; Exhibit&nbsp; "E", submitted by HOS KINS, through its vice-president Antonio Varias, to PHILAMGEN&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to the latter's&nbsp; request to conduct an ocular inspection of the property which Alano was offering as a security to&nbsp; PHILAMGEN so&nbsp; that it may issue a bond in his behalf in favor of one Antonio Roque, states that said property&nbsp; was actually&nbsp; inspected by Varias and that "it&nbsp; is situated approximately 800 m. east of the Novaliches-Ipo Road, at a point about 7 kms. after&nbsp; the Municipality of Novaliches, or approximately 26 kms. from Manila."&nbsp; But an examination&nbsp; of the index map,&nbsp; Exhibit "S", drawn to the scale&nbsp; of 1:50,000, shows that the area referred&nbsp; to is within the Municipality of Caloocan, province of Rizal, the boundary, on&nbsp; the&nbsp; same road, between the provinces of Rizal and Bulacan being situated&nbsp; at kilometer 28 post.&nbsp; On the other hand, it clearly appears that the property subject of&nbsp; appraisal is not in Novaliches nor in Caloocan,&nbsp; Rizal,&nbsp; but is situated in different towns of an&nbsp; entirely&nbsp; different province—Bulacan.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the two parcels of land are located&nbsp; in Norzagaray, Bulacan, while the third is situated in San Jose&nbsp; Del Monte, Bulacan. The fact appears not&nbsp; only in the location&nbsp; plan&nbsp; accompanying defendant's report but is borne out by the certificates of title of Alano, copies of which were given to Varias on the day of the ocular inspection.&nbsp; The statement given in the appraisal report with regard to the&nbsp; location of the property is, therefore,&nbsp; inaccurate.<br><br>Again, the&nbsp; statements made in the&nbsp; appraisal report as to public services and the possibilities of the property, its&nbsp; productivity and income analysis, proved also to be inaccurate.&nbsp; Thus, as to public services and possibilities, the report states that "there is&nbsp; a regular&nbsp; bus service on the Novaliches-Ipo dam and&nbsp; trips to and from&nbsp; Manila to subject&nbsp; property by public&nbsp; transportation take&nbsp; less than an hour."&nbsp; As to production, the report states that the "information gathered&nbsp; from farmers in the vicinity and from certain persons familiar with this&nbsp; section, confirms owner's claim of 20-30 cavans of palay per hectare harvest from&nbsp; his farm.&nbsp; Owner's farm had also informed us that no less than half of the area is&nbsp; already&nbsp; newly planted with&nbsp; this season's&nbsp; crop&nbsp; of rice and they expect to be able to plant at least&nbsp; ¾ "&nbsp; As to income, the&nbsp; report states that the estimated net income of the property&nbsp; is P2,000&nbsp; a year.<br><br>It appears, however, that the two parcels of land situated in&nbsp; Norzagaray,&nbsp; according&nbsp; to surveyor&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Bundang, can only be reached by a foot trail branching southeastward from kilometer 44 post along the Manila-Novaliches-Ipo Road, which foot trail is the only most direct means of access to said parcels of land.&nbsp; No vehicle of&nbsp; any kind can be&nbsp; used on said foot trail.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parcel of land situated in San Jose&nbsp; del Monte, according to&nbsp; Bundang, can&nbsp; also be reached only by&nbsp; a foot trail&nbsp; branching&nbsp; eastward from kilometer 36&nbsp; post along the Novaliches-Ipo&nbsp; Road, which foot trail is likewise the only most direct means of access to said parcels of land.&nbsp; No vehicle of any kind can also be used on&nbsp; said foot trail.&nbsp; The&nbsp; first two&nbsp; parcels are "overgrown with tall grasses",&nbsp; containing no evidence of having been planted to any crops like rice, and with the exception of&nbsp; about&nbsp; five mango&nbsp; fruit-bearing trees, they are entirely without improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp; The third parcel contains also no improvements of any kind and appears not to have been&nbsp; cultivated at all.<br><br>In view&nbsp; of the above discrepancies, the trial court made the following finding:&nbsp; "It is undeniable that the appraisal report referred to does not&nbsp; fit&nbsp; the&nbsp; lands&nbsp; covered by the certificates of Alano because they are not the ones pointed out&nbsp; by Alano to&nbsp; Varias.&nbsp; In this sense,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; report may be said to be false or fabricated."<br><br>But why has the trial court absolved defendant from liability?&nbsp; Its reasons are: "It was a rush appraisal work or job, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; interested party was sent to defendant to specifically&nbsp; point out&nbsp; the&nbsp; location&nbsp; of the&nbsp; property. Plaintiff company&nbsp; must&nbsp; have&nbsp; known&nbsp; from experience it would take time&nbsp; for defendant company, composed of realtors, not surveyors, to locate the property to be appraised; and it&nbsp; must&nbsp; have been for&nbsp; this&nbsp; reason that Mauricio Rodriguez&nbsp; of plaintiff company&nbsp; had to call defendent's office to inform that the owner of the property would specifically point&nbsp; out the location of the same to save time.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, it is not&nbsp; seen how defendant company could be held liable for complying with instructions."<br><br>The above&nbsp; finding is now vigorously disputed by&nbsp; appellants who claim&nbsp; that the same&nbsp; is contrary&nbsp; to the&nbsp; truth. They claim that the&nbsp; same is belied by their&nbsp; evidence. In fact they&nbsp; contend,&nbsp; if it were&nbsp; true that&nbsp; Varias merely followed the&nbsp; instruction given to him by Mauricio Rodriguez&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; appraisal was&nbsp; a rush job&nbsp; and should be expedited,&nbsp; and that he was sending&nbsp; over Epifanio Alano, the interested party,&nbsp; who will indicate to him the property to be appraised,&nbsp; and that Varias&nbsp; merely&nbsp; followed&nbsp; the instruction by inspecting&nbsp; and&nbsp; appraising the&nbsp; property indicated by Alano, it is strange that the appraisal report he&nbsp; later submitted does&nbsp; not contain any statement to that effect, or that it was made hurriedly&nbsp; because it&nbsp; was a rush job, for which reason&nbsp; he was not able to make use of a surveyor as&nbsp; is to&nbsp; be expected from&nbsp; a reliable&nbsp; and competent appraiser as&nbsp; defendant.<br><br>There is indeed&nbsp; more&nbsp; than&nbsp; what the eye&nbsp; can see in&nbsp; this claim.&nbsp; The record shows&nbsp; that HOSKINS&nbsp; had been engaged to do appraisal work not only for PHILAMGEN but also for its sister companies,&nbsp; The Philippine American Life Insurance Company,&nbsp; and the United States&nbsp; Life Insurance Company, and&nbsp; as such,&nbsp; has&nbsp; collected from said companies&nbsp; considerable sums in appraisal&nbsp; fees.&nbsp; HOSKINS, therefore, can be considered as a confidential adviser to PHILAMGEN on appraisal matters, such that the latter had&nbsp; every right&nbsp; to rely on its&nbsp; advice&nbsp; and recommendation&nbsp; without further inquiry&nbsp; or&nbsp; investigation of its own.&nbsp; This requires that HOSKINS&nbsp; make its appraisal work as accurate as possible even if&nbsp; it were a rush job. The urgency of the work can not justify misrepresentation. Aside from this, there is one circumstance which creates doubt in our minds as&nbsp; to the manner the appraisal was made by Varias even if we&nbsp; assume that&nbsp; he&nbsp; merely&nbsp; followed the&nbsp; instruction&nbsp; given by&nbsp; his&nbsp; employer.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; a matter&nbsp; that appears&nbsp; in the evidence that when&nbsp; Alano showed&nbsp; up&nbsp; in the office of Varias, in order to have his property appraised, he&nbsp; not only&nbsp; presented&nbsp; himself to be the interested party but handed over to Varias a blueprint of the property as certified by a surveyor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Bureau of Lands,&nbsp; together with photostatic&nbsp; copies of his titles and tax declarations.&nbsp; In said blueprint the natural boundaries of the property are clearly&nbsp; indicated,&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as its&nbsp; exact location&nbsp; and area.&nbsp; And&nbsp; there it appears that two parcels of land are located in Norzagaray,&nbsp; Bulacan, whereas the other parcel is situated in San Jose del Monte, of the same province.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Varias had only observed ordinary diligence and exerted&nbsp; the&nbsp; effort a prudent man in The Phil. American General Insurance Co.. Inc., and&nbsp; . Campos <i>vs.</i> C. H. Hoskins &amp; Co., Inc. locating the&nbsp; property, he would have&nbsp; found by a mere examination of the blueprint that the property indicated by Alano is not in Bulacan, but in Caloocan, or Novaliches, province of Rizal, and would have&nbsp; immediately detected evil design Alano had then in mind in carrying out hia&nbsp; objective.&nbsp; But Varias failed to take&nbsp; such&nbsp; rudimentary&nbsp; precaution and now tries to shield himself behind so flimsy&nbsp; a&nbsp; claim that he just followed blindly&nbsp; what&nbsp; was told to him by Alano.&nbsp; There is therefore enough reason to believe that while it may be&nbsp; true that&nbsp; the appraisal&nbsp; job given to Varias is urgent in nature, Varias' action&nbsp; has&nbsp; not been one that may be justified under the circumstances. <br><br>We believe however that it is now of no moment to determine if&nbsp; under the circumstances HOSKINS could be&nbsp; held liable for the consequences of its professional conduct, which appellants claim has cost them the&nbsp; loss of a&nbsp; portion of their investment.&nbsp; The reason is&nbsp; one of procedure which in our opinion is decisive of this case.&nbsp; We&nbsp; refer to the claim that appellants have no cause&nbsp; of action&nbsp; against HOSKINS&nbsp; for&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; clear showing that they&nbsp;&nbsp; have actually&nbsp; sustained damages&nbsp; arising&nbsp; from such&nbsp; actuation.<br><br>The evidence shows that&nbsp; in consideration of the bond which PHILAMGEN executed&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; Antonio I. Roque to guarantee the loan obtained from him by Epifanio G. Alano, Miguel Campos personally took a first mortgage on Alanos' property because the register of deeds of Bulacan had refused to register the mortgage executed by&nbsp; Alano in favor of PHILAMGEN on the claim&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; property had&nbsp; been originally acquired as a homestead, and that subsequently Campos executed in favor of PHILAMGEN an indemnity agreement in&nbsp; behalf of the Alanos for the purpose of indemnifying the aforesaid bond.&nbsp; The evidence also shows&nbsp; that Alano defaulted and so Roque demanded payment from PHILAMGEN who&nbsp; immediately made good its&nbsp; obligation under the bond.&nbsp; The&nbsp; evidence further shows&nbsp; that Campos foreclosed&nbsp; the mortgage of&nbsp; Alano and&nbsp; that&nbsp; although he obtained judgment against the latter, he however bought the&nbsp; property&nbsp; of&nbsp; Alano as the highest&nbsp; bidder&nbsp; only for the&nbsp; sum of P10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recourse therefore of PHILAMGEN is&nbsp; against Campos under the latter's indemnity agreement, while the remedy of Campos&nbsp; to recover the balance is to&nbsp; ask&nbsp; for an&nbsp; alias writ&nbsp; of&nbsp; execution against&nbsp; Alano.&nbsp; There is&nbsp; no&nbsp; showing that such steps had been taken.<br><br>It is with reason that the trial court made the&nbsp; following observation: "Plaintiff Campos&nbsp; has no&nbsp; cause of action against the herein defendant because it was not he, but plaintiff company, that paid the loan of&nbsp; Alano to Roque; on&nbsp; the other hand,&nbsp; plaintiff company&nbsp; has&nbsp; no&nbsp; cause of action against defendant because it has a counter-security in the form of counter-bond in its favor, the&nbsp; condition of which being that it would not collect the loss of Campos until&nbsp; the&nbsp; property is sold; hence, plaintiff company's recourse is against plaintiff Campos."&nbsp; As the situation now stands, appellants' action is premature.<br><br>We are therefore constrained to affirm, as we hereby do, the decision of the trial court, without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
