				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Sy Beng&nbsp; Guat&nbsp; was charged with&nbsp; estafa&nbsp; in two cases before the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Rizal.&nbsp; He posted a bail bond in the sum of&nbsp; P4,000.00 subscribed by the Manila&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Fidelity&nbsp; Co., Inc. for his provisional liberty.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the date set for the continuation of the trial, the bondsman moved for postponement on the ground that it was&nbsp; still&nbsp; trying&nbsp; to locate the accused who,&nbsp; according to its information, was confined in jail in connection with two other cases pending in Quezon City.&nbsp; The court denied the motion&nbsp; and ordered the forfeiture of the bond giving the&nbsp; bondsman 30 days&nbsp; within which to&nbsp; produce the accused&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; show cause why&nbsp; judgment should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be rendered&nbsp; against it for the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of the bond.&nbsp; The bondsman filed a motion for an extension of 30 days within which to comply with the court's order, which was granted. A second motion for extension of&nbsp; 30 days was filed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; bondsman,&nbsp; and&nbsp; again&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was&nbsp; granted.&nbsp; The bondsman having failed to produce&nbsp; the accused within the period&nbsp; extended, the court&nbsp; granted it another&nbsp; period&nbsp; of grace to expire on October&nbsp; 20, 1955.<br><br>After the surety company failed to produce the.accused even after the several postponements given&nbsp; to it, the trial court on&nbsp; November 24, 1955 rendered judgment against it on the bond and ordered&nbsp; that a writ of execution&nbsp; be issued for the satisfaction&nbsp; of the judgment.&nbsp; On&nbsp; November 25, 1955, the bondsman learned that the accused was confined in the New Bilibid Prisons at Muntinglupa serving the sentence imposed upon him in two criminal cases by the Court of First Instance of Manila, for which reason it could not produce him in court as required, and so on December 8, 1955 it filed a motion to lift the order of confiscation praying that it&nbsp; be relieved&nbsp; from its liability under the bond.&nbsp; As this motion was denied, the bondsman&nbsp; took the present appeal.<br><br>The law governing the forfeiture of bail is Section 15, Rule&nbsp; 110,&nbsp; of the Rules of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; which provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 15. Forfeiture of bail.â€”When the appearance of the defendant is&nbsp; required by the court, his&nbsp; sureties shall be notified to produce him&nbsp; before&nbsp; the&nbsp; court on a&nbsp; given&nbsp; date.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; fails to appear&nbsp; as required, the bond is declared forfeited and the bondsmen are given thirty days within which&nbsp; to produce their principal and to show cause why a judgment should not be rendered against them for&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of their&nbsp; bond.&nbsp; Within&nbsp; the&nbsp; said period&nbsp; of thirty&nbsp; days, the bondsmen (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>)&nbsp; must&nbsp; produce&nbsp; the body of their principal or give the reason&nbsp; for&nbsp; its non-production; and&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) must explain satisfactorily why&nbsp; defendant did not appear before&nbsp; the court when first required so to do.&nbsp; Failing in&nbsp; these two requisites a&nbsp; judgment shall be&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; against&nbsp; the bondsmen."<br></blockquote>It would appear that when a&nbsp; case is&nbsp; set&nbsp; for trial the duty of the&nbsp; bondsman is to see&nbsp; to it that&nbsp; the accused appears on the date of trial.&nbsp; If he fails to&nbsp; do so,&nbsp; he should be given 30 days&nbsp; within which to produce the accused&nbsp; and to show cause&nbsp; why judgment should not&nbsp; he rendered&nbsp; against him for the amount of the bond, and within said period,&nbsp; the bondsman&nbsp; is required to do two things.&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; to produce the&nbsp; body of the&nbsp; accused or give reasons for his non-production; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; to&nbsp; explain satisfactorily&nbsp; why&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to appear when&nbsp; first required to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to do either&nbsp; may subject&nbsp; the bondsman to liability.<br><br>It thus clearly&nbsp; appears&nbsp; that the mere production&nbsp; or appearance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused within&nbsp; the period set by the court after his failure to appear when first&nbsp; required&nbsp; for trial would not suffice to exonerate the bondsman&nbsp; from liability,&nbsp; nor entitle him to release&nbsp; as&nbsp; a matter of right, but it is still necessary that he give satisfactory reasons why he failed to appear when <i>first required to do so</i>.&nbsp; In the instant case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; bondsman not&nbsp; only was&nbsp; not able to&nbsp; produce the body of the accused&nbsp; despite the several extensions&nbsp; granted to it, but failed to explain satisfactorily why&nbsp; it was not able to produce him during the trial set on July 19, 1955.&nbsp; It,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; failed to comply with the&nbsp; law.<br><br>In its&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to lift&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of confiscation, the bondsman stated: "From reliable information the herein movant was informed that the accused&nbsp; Sy Beng&nbsp; Guat has already been confined at&nbsp; the Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Prisons&nbsp; (Muntinglupa) serving&nbsp; sentence in&nbsp; connection with&nbsp; Criminal Cases Nos.&nbsp; 10900&nbsp; and 11037 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; as&nbsp; evidenced&nbsp; by a&nbsp; certificate of the Bureau of Prisons."&nbsp; It was there stated that he was&nbsp; committed to said penitentiary only on November&nbsp; 30,&nbsp; 1955. If it is true, as certified by the&nbsp; Director of Prisons,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; accused was&nbsp; involved in two other&nbsp; criminal&nbsp; cases pending&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Manila&nbsp; and, as it is to be presumed, he was at all&nbsp; times available to that court during&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution and&nbsp; trial of said two cases, we see no plausible reason for the bondsman not to know his whereabouts and not to produce him for the trial in the instant&nbsp; cases considering the several extensions granted by the court to locate and produce him&nbsp; The fact that the accused was&nbsp; dealt with in due course in the two cases above-mentioned so much so that he was eventually confined&nbsp; in&nbsp; prison,&nbsp; confirms&nbsp; our view&nbsp; that&nbsp; the bondsman has failed to do its duty to keep&nbsp; a continuous surveillance over him which accounted&nbsp; for&nbsp; its failure&nbsp; to produce him when required by&nbsp; the&nbsp; court.<br><br>In a recent&nbsp; case&nbsp; decided&nbsp; by this&nbsp; Court, we said: "It is obvious from the above-quoted section&nbsp; that&nbsp; if after notice to produce the defendant is served upon the sureties the defendant fails to appear at the time required by the court, the bail bond shall be declared forfeited, and the forfeiture can only be&nbsp; discharge if,&nbsp; within thirty&nbsp; days, the defendant appears when&nbsp; required to&nbsp; do so.&nbsp; <i>The personal appearance&nbsp; of the defendant&nbsp; is therefore not sufficient;</i> it is still&nbsp; necessary that it&nbsp; be accompanied by a satisfactory explanation&nbsp; of&nbsp; his&nbsp; failure to&nbsp; appear.&nbsp; <i>Mere explanation is not also enough.&nbsp; It is of prime importance that&nbsp; it be&nbsp; satisfactory</i> in order that the surety may be discharged from liability.&nbsp; And it is well settled that the question&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; explanation given is&nbsp; or is not sufficient is&nbsp; a&nbsp; matter&nbsp; that&nbsp; lies&nbsp; within&nbsp; the discretion&nbsp; of the court"&nbsp; (People <i>vs.</i> Felix,&nbsp; G. R. No. L-10094, May 14, 1957; Italics&nbsp; ours).&nbsp; Here the&nbsp; explanation given&nbsp; is not satisfactory; neither can&nbsp; it entitle the&nbsp; bondsman to a mitigation of its&nbsp; liability.<br><br>Wherefore, the order&nbsp; appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A., Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i>&nbsp; concur.</div>
