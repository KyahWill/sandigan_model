				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a special civil action for certiorari.
<p align="justify">Respondent Feliciano Sarmiento filed an action for illegal 
detainer against petitioners Angelina Canaynay, Prudencia V. Asprec and Cleto 
Asprec in the Justice of the Peace Court of Para√±aque, Rizal. Petitioners filed 
an answer claiming ownership of the property and after trial asked for the 
dismissal of the case upon the ground that it involved a question of title over 
which the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction. The motion was denied and 
judgment was rendered against petitioners, who appealed to the Court of First 
Instance. Upon the docketting of the case in that court, petitioners filed what 
they called a "Constancia", wherein they impugned the jurisdiction of the 
justice of the peace and objected to the exercise by the Court of First Instance 
of its original jurisdiction over the case and prayed that "after hearing the 
above-entitled case be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction of the justice of the 
peace court." According to the petitioners themselves, this "Constancia" was not 
meant as a motion to dismiss but merely to make of record their objection to 
both the jurisdiction of toe justice of the peace and the original jurisdiction 
of the Court of First Instance, and their prayer was that "after the trial of 
this case when this court (of First Instance) shall have found from the evidence 
presented that the real question involved is one of ownership and not merely 
possession, to declare that the justice of the peace court is without 
jurisdiction, and, consequently, should dismiss the case." But the prayer 
contained in this "Constancia" was denied by the court.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, petitioners failed to file their answer to the 
complaint which was deemed reproduced in the Court of First Instance upon the 
docketing of the case therein, and for that reason, the court, on motion of the 
plaintiff, declared petitioners in default. Petitioners fled a motion for 
reconsideration upon the ground that the answer filed in the justice of the 
peace court should have been deemed reproduced also in the Court of First 
Instance, but the motion was denied. The Court, after receiving the evidence for 
the plaintiff, rendered judgment against petitioners ordering them to vacate the 
property and to pay the rents thereof to plaintiff. Whereupon, petitioners, 
instead of appealing from this decision and from the order of default filed this 
special civil action for certiorari in this Court.</p>
<p align="justify">The only ground alleged by petitioners against the order of 
default issued against them is that, upon the docketing of the case in the Court 
of First Instance, not only the complaint but also the answer filed in the 
justice of the peace court should have been deemed reproduced. However, this 
contention is contrary to Rule 40, section 7, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Upon the docketing of the cause under appeal, the complaint 
filed in the justice of the peace or municipal court shall be considered 
reproduced in the Court of First Instance and it shall be the duty of the clerk 
of the court to notify the parties of that fact by registered mail, and the 
period for making an answer shall begin with the date of the receipt of such 
notice by the defendant."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">According to this provision, what is deemed reproduced in the 
Court of First Instance upon the docketing of the case therein, is only the 
complaint, but not the answer, filed in the justice of the peace or municipal 
court. The reason is that there may be no answer filed in the justice of the 
peace court, or that if there is any filed therein, it may be changed in the 
Court of First Instance where a trial <i>de novo</i>, is to be held. Although 
neither the plaintiff nor the defendant may change on appeal in the Court of 
First Instance the questions raised by the pleadings in the inferior court, a 
denial that may have been made in the justice of the peace court may be changed 
into an admission, or a special defense interposed therein may be withdrawn in 
the Court of First Instance. It is then necessary for the defendant to re-define 
his stand in the Court of First Instance by filing an answer in due time, and 
his failure to do so is ground for default.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition is dismissed, with costs against the petitioners.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Paras, Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Briones, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><i>CONCURRING </i></p>
<p align="justify">PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">We concur in the decision as a correct exposition and 
interpretation of section 7 of Rule 40.</p>
<p align="justify">We feel, however, that it is our duty to express our opinion to 
the effect that the said section should be amended as being unreasonable and 
unfair to the defendant. We do not see any reason why the defendant should be 
compelled to file a new answer or reproduce his answer as filed in the municipal 
court, while plaintiff is relieved from the obligation of reproducing his 
complaint.</p></div>
