				<BR><STRONG>OZAETA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On October&nbsp; 3, 1934, appellant&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; judgment against Manuel Soriano for the sum of P1,000 in civil case No. 6380 of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Laguna.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter Manuel&nbsp; Soriano delivered to appellant two powers of attorney dated, respectively, December 31, 1932, and September 22, 1933, executed by his sister, the herein appellee Sor Josefa Soriano, whereby she authorized&nbsp; him to mortgage to appellant and to the Pagsanjan Agricultural Association one half <i>pro indiviso</i> of her land known as lot No. 4066 of the Pagsanjan cadastre&nbsp; and described in&nbsp; original certificate of title No. 11277 to guarantee his indebtedness&nbsp; to them, and bound herself to recognize any incumbrance that might be&nbsp; constituted on&nbsp; said&nbsp; property&nbsp; in&nbsp; their&nbsp; favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Manuel Soriano did not execute any mortgage on his sister's property in favor&nbsp; of appellant by virtue of said powers of attorney,&nbsp; but the appellant considered the delivery to it of said powers of attorney as sufficient security.<br><br>On January 19, 1937, appellant procured a writ of execution in said civil case No. 6380&nbsp; against Manuel Soriano and caused the sheriff to levy&nbsp; upon and sell at public auction one half pro indiviso of said lot No. 4066,&nbsp; on the assumption that appellee had guaranteed the payment of Manuel Soriano's obligation.&nbsp; The sheriff adjudicated said property to appellant as the highest bidder in the sum of P1,308.69, and after the lapse of one year issued to it a final deed of sale.<br><br>After failing in its attempt to have the certificate of title transferred to its name by means of a motion in&nbsp; the cadastral case, appellant instituted the present action&nbsp; to recover the possession and ownership of the land in question from the appellee.&nbsp; His Honor,&nbsp; Judge Alejo Labrador, absolved the&nbsp; appellee from the complaint,&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that appellant acquired no right as purchaser at the sheriff's sale because the&nbsp; execution debtor Manuel&nbsp; Soriano had&nbsp; no interest or participation in the&nbsp; property levied upon.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; the undisputed facts&nbsp; above set forth,&nbsp; we are at a loss to see how plaintiff's action could prosper.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that appellee authorized her brother to&nbsp; mortgage the land in question in favor of appellant;&nbsp; but until that authority was exercised, it&nbsp; is too obvious for argument that appellant could claim no right either to said land or against appellee.&nbsp; Appellee's obligation to recognize any incumbrance that might be constituted&nbsp; on her land certainly did not accrue until such incumbrance was actually constituted. Even if appellee had authorized Manuel Soriano to sell the&nbsp; land in question to pay his obligation, as contended by appellant, the stubborn fact remains that Manuel Soriano did not exercise that authority.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; the sheriff who sold the&nbsp; land in question on the assumption that Manuel Soriano had an interest or participation therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; That assumption being false, the purchaser acquired nothing by virtue of the&nbsp; sale.<br><br>Appellant further contends that the trial court should have granted&nbsp; its alternative&nbsp; prayer that&nbsp; Manuel&nbsp; Soriano and the appellee be sentenced to pay appellant the&nbsp; total sum of P2,761.83 with compound interest at 12% per annum from July 3, 1938, on the theory that appellee had constituted herself a surety for&nbsp; her&nbsp; brother and codefendant. There is no basis in fact and in law for such contention.<br><br>his appeal is entirely devoid of merit.&nbsp; The judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Yulo, C.J., Moran</i>,&nbsp; and <i>Bocobo, JJ.</i>, concur. <i><br>Paras, J.</i>, concurs in the result. </div>
