				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. JOSE PALICTE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the People's Court finding the appellant 
guilty of treason and sentencing him to 15 years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, 
with the accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay a fine of P5,000 plus 
the costs.
<p>The evidence for the prosecution tends to show that in the month of August, 
1943, the appellant led a group of Japanese soldiers and Filipino undercovers to 
the barrio of Sacsac, Catmon, Cebu City, in search of a guerrilla officer named 
Mercado. Upon arrival at the place, the appellant and his companions 
investigated Ambrosio Ares and Cornelio Diores as to Mercado's whereabouts, and 
when no information was obtainable from them, the appellant and his companions 
gathered the people together. Thereupon, a Japanese delivered a speech, the 
appellant acting as interpreter. After the meeting, the appellant and other 
Filipino undercovers burned the house of Mercado.</p>
<p>The same evidence tends to show that a group of Japanese led by the appellant 
arrested on October 18, 1943, at about five o'clock in the afternoon, Jose 
Bontuyan in his house in Sirao, Cebu City, on the charge of guerrilla 
connections; that the said Bontuyan was boxed and later investigated, and 
tortured, by the appellant.</p>
<p>The defense set up by the appellant is alibi, in that from June to November, 
1943, he was a prisoner of the Japanese Kempei Tai. Appellant's testimony is 
corroborated by defense witness, Raymundo Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Counsel <em>de oficio</em>, aside from relying on the alibi, contends that 
the appellant could not have acted freely on the occasions invoked by the 
prosecution.</p>
<p>We are inclined to sustain appellant's contention that he had merely followed 
Japanese orders. Prosecution witness Ambrosio Ares testified that he did not 
know who ordered the burning of Mercado's house, and that a Japanese captain 
ordered the soldiers to group together, after which the Filipinos started to get 
torches and burn Mercado's house. From this it is inferable that, even assuming 
that appellant was one of those who applied fire to the house, he did so upon 
orders of the Japanese captain.</p>
<p>With respect to the alleged arrest of Jose Bontuyan, we also believe that the 
appellant was a mere follower of the Japanese. This is to be deduced from the 
testimony of prosecution witness, Amada Solon Bontuyan (wife of Jose Bontuyan), 
to the effect that, "we heard the Japanese who investigated, one called 
Nagasima; he said cone here Jose Palicte, that is the time I know his name." In 
other words, the one who investigated on the occasion when Jose Bontuyan was 
allegedly arrested was a Japanese who even called for the appellant.</p>
<p>Another prosecution witness, Cornelio Diores, in referring to the occasion in 
which Mercado was sought by the Japanese soldiers and Filipino undercovers, 
testified that the Japanese ordered the people to group together, from which it 
is again clear that it was the Japanese who gave commands.</p>
<p>We cannot help entertaining a doubt as to the veracity of witnesses for the 
prosecution when we take into account some material inconsistencies in their 
testimony. For instance, while Ambrosio Ares and Cornelio Diores testified that 
the appellant made his own speech, Mariano Laude emphasized that the appellant 
only interpreted the speech of the Japanese. While Ambrosio Ares testified that 
there were sis Filipinos, Cornelio Diores stated that there was only one 
Filipino. Whereas, Cornelio Diores declared that Ares was investigated before 
the alleged meeting, Mariano Laude testified that the investigation of Ares took 
place after the meeting.</p>
<p>Another doubtful point engendered by the evidence for the prosecution is 
that, although Mercado was allegedly sought by the appellant and his companions 
in August, 1943, there is absolutely no showing as to the reason for the search. 
The bare fact that Mercado might have been a guerrilla is not sufficient to 
prove that ho was wanted on that ground. The foregoing considerations make it 
unnecessary for us to discuss appellant's assignment of error with reference to 
the admission by the trial court of the amendment of the original information 
after the expiration of the six-month period fixed by Commonwealth Act No. 
682.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed judgment is reversed and the appellant acquitted, 
with costs <em>de oficio</em>. So ordered.</p><em>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Pablo, 
Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes</em>, and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur. 
<br><br><br>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p>TUASON, <em>J</em>., dissenting:</p>
<p>I think the appellant was a wilful collaborator. The Japanese did not coerce 
unwilling people to do what they themselves could easily do and were experts in 
burning homes, torturing and massacring people. And unwilling collaborators did 
not go to the extent of committing such atrocities. I am therefore constrained 
to dissent.</p></div>
