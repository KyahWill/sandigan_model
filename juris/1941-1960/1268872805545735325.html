				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> In testate proceedings, civil case No. 51955 of the Court of 
First Instance of Manila, the will of E. M. Bachrach, who died on September 28, 
1937, provided for the distribution of the considerable property which he had 
left. The provisions of the will which are important in this case are contained 
in the sixth and eighth paragraphs which read as follows:
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Sixth: It is my will and do herewith bequeath and devise to my 
beloved wife Mary McDonald Bachrach for life all the fruits and usufruct of the 
remainder of all my estate after payment of the legacies, bequests and gifts 
provided for above; and she may enjoy such usufruct and use or spend such fruits 
as she may in any manner wish."</p>
<p align="justify">"Eighth: It is my wish that upon the death of my beloved wife, 
Mary McDonald Bachrach, all my estate, personal, real and otherwise, and all the 
fruits and usufruct thereof which during her life pertained to her, shall be 
divided as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">'One-half thereof shall be given to such charitable hospitals 
in the Philippines as she may designate; in case she fails to designate, then 
said sum shall be given to the Chief Executive of these Islands who shall 
distribute it, share and share alike to all charitable hospitals in the 
Philippines excluding those belonging to the governments of the Philippines or 
of the United States;</p>
<p align="justify">'One-half thereof shall be divided, share and share alike by 
and between my legal heirs, to the exclusion of my brothers.' " 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The widow Mary McDonald Bachrach as administratrix and 
executrix had been administering the property left by her deceased husband and 
enjoying the usufruct thereof. The other heirs Sophie M. Seifert, Ginda M. 
Skundina, Elisa Elianoff and Annie Bachrach Levine on September 14, 1940, filed 
a petition, agreed to by usufructuary Mary McDonald Bachrach, and the Solititor 
General representing the Government of the Philippines, asking that the 
administratrix "be authorized to pay your petitioners from and after July 1, 
1940, and until they receive their share of the estate left by the deceased E. 
M. Bachrach upon the death of his widow, a monthly allowance of P500, P250, 
P250, and P250, respectively, and the additional sum of P3,000 to the heir 
Sophie M. Seifert, who is in poor health, the said allowances to be deducted 
from your petitioners' share of the estate of the deceased E. M. Bachrach upon 
the death of the widow." Acting upon the said petition, the Court of First 
Instance of Manila issued an order dated October 2, 1940 granting the petition 
in the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Petition granted; and the administratrix and usufructuary Mary 
McDonald Bachrach is hereby authorized and instructed forthwith to pay to the 
said Sophie M. Seifert, Ginda M. Skundina, Elisa Elianoff and Annie Bachrach 
Levine a monthly allowance of Five Hundred (P500) Pesos; Two Hundred Fifty 
(P250) Pesos; Two Hundred Fifty (P250) Pesos, and Two Hundred Fifty (P250) 
Pesos, respectively, beginning July 1, 1940, and until the said heirs receive 
their share of the estate left by the deceased E. M. Bachrach upon the death of 
his widow, and the additional sum of Three Thousand (P3,000) Pesos to the heir 
Sophie M. Seifert."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">From July 1, 1940 to December 31, 1941, the administratrix made 
the payments as ordered, having paid the total amount of P40,250. Payments 
during the Japanese occupation which would have amounted to P32,500, was 
suspended. Then payments were resumed from August, 1945 to January, 1947. 
Thereafter, the executrix declined to make further payments. The heirs 
petitioned the lower court for a writ of execution, ordering the administratrix 
to pay the allowances for February, 1947 and those in arrears for the period 
comprising from January 1, 1942 to July 31, 1945. This petition was denied and 
the heirs filed a petition for mandamus in the Supreme Court under G. R. No. 
L-1379.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The petition for mandamus was 
granted by this Court and the lower court was ordered to proceed in the 
execution of its order of October 2, 1940 and to issue the proper writ.</p>
<p align="justify">In the meantime, the administratrix Mary McDonald Bachrach, 
filed in the same case No. 51955 in the Court of First Instance of Manila a 
petition on February 19, 1947, recommending the liquidation of the assets of the 
estate of her deceased husband destined for charity because due to the havoc and 
miseries brought about by the last war, the charitable institutions to be 
benefited badly needed the property bequeathed to them under the will.</p>
<p align="justify">In another petition by the same administratrix Mary McDonald 
filed on February 18, 1947, she alleged that under the order of the court of 
October 2, 1940, she had already paid to the heirs P40,250; that besides that 
amount the heirs were demanding the amount of P32,500 representing the 
allowances that had accrued during the Japanese occupation while the estate was 
financially and economically prostrate; that the allowances paid to said heirs 
were taken from the fruits and income of the estate which belong exclusively to 
her as a usufructuary, that is to say, that the allowances paid to the heirs 
were advances from her personal funds; and that unless the heirs gave sufficient 
security for the protection of the administratrix, the 1/2 of the property 
corresponding to the heirs which consists mainly of shares of stock, when sold 
later, may not be sufficient to reimburse her estate after her death for the 
allowances made or given to the heirs from her personal funds. On the basis of 
said allegations, the administratrix prayed the court that she be relieved from 
the obligation to pay the heirs the monthly allowances ordered by the court in 
its order of October 2, 1940, and in the alternative, in the event that the 
court ordered her to continue the payments of said allowances, that she be 
authorized to sell as much of the assets of the 1/2 destined for the instituted 
heirs as may be necessary to enable her to continue the payment of said 
allowances.</p>
<p align="justify">Evidently, acting upon these two petitions, the lower court 
issued its order dated February 27, 1947, expressing its opinion that pending 
the determination of the proceedings, it would be advisable to sell the property 
destined for charity and also those of the instituted heirs. It authorized the 
administratrix to sell at the best price obtainable in the market, not only 
those properties destined for charities but also the one-half adjudicated to the 
instituted heirs, the proceeds thereof, to be distributed accordingly later on. 
Acting upon a motion for reconsideration filed on behalf of the heirs, the lower 
court denied said motion, justifying its order sought to be reconsidered with 
the allegation that the case had been pending for several years; that the sale 
of said properties included in the testate proceedings and distribution of the 
proceeds of the sale to the beneficiaries was one way of winding up said 
proceedings and the beneficiaries would be benefited in that they would receive 
their shares earlier. The heirs appealed from that order of February 27, 1947, 
and the order denying their motion for reconsideration. That appeal under G. R. 
No. L-1592 of this Court, is now the case under consideration.</p>
<p align="justify">Our first impression was that the appellants had no valid 
reason for objecting to the sale of the 1/2 of the estate adjudicated to them 
because in that way they would receive their shares earlier; furthermore, that 
the administratrix was warranted in asking for the sale of said 1/2 of the 
property adjudicated to the heirs or as much thereof as was sufficient to 
reimburse for the allowances being paid by her to the heirs from her personal 
funds or from the fruits of the said 1/2 which, as a usufructuary, belonged to 
her. Upon a closer scrutiny of the record however, not only of this case (G. R. 
No. L-1592) but also of G. R. No. L-1379 of which we take judicial notice, for 
which reason, said last case was cited and referred to for purposes of 
background so as to give a clear understanding of the facts in this case, we 
find that the allowances being paid to the heirs are really not paid from the 
personal funds of the administratrix but from the cash corresponding to the 1/2 
of the estate adjudicated to the heirs, which cash, is deposited in the bank. 
According to the decision of the Supreme Court in the mandamus case (G. R. No. 
L-1379) promulgated on December 19, 1947, the administratrix had in her 
possession the sum of P351,116.91 which has already been adjudicated to and 
belongs, although <i>pro indiviso</i>, to the heirs of the deceased E. M. 
Bachrach and that furthermore, the monthly allowances being paid to the heirs or 
due them should be paid from this sum and not from the personal funds of the 
administratrix Mary McDonald Bachrach. Furthermore, the very order of the lower 
court of October 2, 1940, authorizing the administratrix to pay to the heirs the 
monthly allowances already mentioned, stipulated in its fourth paragraph that 
said allowances should be taken from the properties to be turned over to the 
heirs of the deceased E. M. Bachrach and shall be deducted from the share of 
said heirs upon the death of the widow.</p>
<p align="justify">In the opinion of this Court, the cash in the possession of the 
administratrix corresponding to the 1/2 of the estate adjudicated to the heirs 
is sufficient for the monthly allowances being paid to the heirs and that there 
is no necessity for the sale of the 1/2 of the estate corresponding to them. The 
main objection of the heirs to the sale of 1/2 of the estate adjudicated to 
them, which 1/2 besides the cash already mentioned, consists mostly of shares of 
stock, is that said shares if sold now may not command a good price and that 
furthermore said heirs prefer to keep said shares intact as long as there is no 
real necessity for their sale. Of course, once said cash in the hands of the 
administratrix, corresponding to the heirs is exhausted because of the payment 
of the allowances made to the heirs, some other arrangements might be necessary. 
The administratrix would then have a right and reason to refuse the payment of 
said allowances from her said personal funds or from the fruits of the estate, 
which as a usufructuary, belong to her during her lifetime. But, until that 
point is reached, we see no valid reason for ordering the sale of the 1/2 of the 
estate belonging to the heirs over their objection.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of the foregoing, the order appealed from, insofar as 
it directs the sale of the one-half share of the estate destined and adjudicated 
to the instituted heirs, is hereby reversed. With costs.</p>
