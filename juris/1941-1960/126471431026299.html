				<H3>MALATE  TAXICAB & GARAGE, INC., PETITIONER,  VS.  THE COURT OP INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND NATIONAL LABOR UNION, RESPONDENTS.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Following  the dismissal  of some 360  drivers of the Malate  Taxicab &amp; Garage,  Inc.,  hereinafter  referred  to as Malate Taxicab, as a result of the sale of its franchise and taxicabs  to  another taxicab operator  on  September 10,  1954,  the  National  Labor Union, on the  13th of  that same month, filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations on behalf of the dismissed drivers, asking that they be  paid  one month's separation pay.   Malate Taxicab moved for the dismissal of the petition on the grounds, among others, that it stated no  cause  of action and that the court  had  no jurisdiction  over the  subject matter. On a day set the motion  was argued, but the court after hearing  both sides announced  that,  to  abbreviate  proceedings, it would defer its resolution on the motion "until after  the  reception of  the  whole  evidence in  order  to decide the case finally", whereupon the parties entered into a stipulation  of facts and informed the court  that with said stipulation they "were submitting their case for decision."  The stipulation reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That the petitioner is  a commercial establishment; that it operates a fleet of  taxicabs under franchise  from the Public Service Commission; that  to operate those taxicabs,  it had hired drivers; that the drivers were paid on commission basis  of 25  per cent of their gross earnings;  that on September  10,  1954, these cars operated by the  taxicab firm were sold to the  Manila Yellow Taxicab  Co.; that on the same  date, the 360  drivers  of the petitioner were dismissed;  that there  was no  one month prior notice given to these drivers and neither were they paid one month salary in lieu  of such  notice."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view  of the above stipulation,  the court denied the motion to  dismiss and  ordered  Malate Taxicab  to  pay each of the 360 drivers "P120 as separation pay, based on  30 working days at P4  per day, which is the minimum wage fixedly law."  Reconsideration of this order having been denied by the court in bane, Malate Taxicab brought the case here on a petition to review by certiorari.</p>
<p>The  main question for  determination is whether taxicab  drivers  "paid on commission basis  of 25 per  cent of their gross earnings", are  entitled to a month's separation pay if 'dismissed without one month's prior  notice.</p>
<p>Invoking our  decision in  the  case of Lara,  et al. vs.. Del Rosario, 50 Off. Gaz., 1975, Malate Taxicab maintains that the question should be answered  in the negative.  But to this  we cannot agree.</p>
<p>The question presented in the  case cited was whether taxicab drivers receiving by way  of compensation certain percentage  of  their  gross  fare receipts  were, on  being dismissed without a month's  advance  notice,  entitled to the <em>mesada;</em> or month's  salary, mentioned in  article  302 of the  Code of Commerce, and we there held  that  the said article  could no longer  be  applied  because it  had already been repealed by the new Civil Code.   But by way of dictum  it was also there said that even assuming that the article mentioned was still in force,  nevertheless, since it spoke  of "salary corresponding  to  said month, commonly known  as<em> mesada</em>", it would have no application to employees having "no fixed salary either by the day, week or the month", since computation of  the month's salary payable in that case  would be impossible.</p>
<p>It appears, however,  that subsequent to  this  decision, and  possibly as a consequence thereof, Republic  Act  No. 1052 was approved on June 12, 1954.   The Act provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Section 1. In  cases  of employment, without a definite period,, in a  commercial,  industrial, or agricultural establishment or enterprise, neither the employer nor the employee shall terminate the employment without  serving notice  on the other at least one month in advance.</p>
  <p>"The  employee, upon whom no  such notice  was served,  shall be entitled to one month's compensation from the date of termination of  his employment.</p>
  <p>"Sec. 2. Any contract or agreement  contrary to  the  provisions, of section one of this Act shall be null and void."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note must  be  taken of the  fact that  the  new  law no longer speaks of  "salary" but of  "compensation", a term broad enough to include all forms  of remuneration.  And we  do not think  it could  be successfully argued  that  remuneration paid  to  taxi  drivers   on a percentage  basis does not constitute <em>compensation.</em></p>
<p>The  point is  made that the object of Republic  Act  No. 1052 is only to fill  a void left by the repeal of article 302  of the Code  of Commerce,  or  in other words, to revive  the <em>mesada mentioned</em> in said article.   This narrow interpretation  is  not  in accord with  the  liberal  spirit  of our labor laws.  As correctly contended by the labor union and sustained  by the  lower  court,  what  was revived by the  Act was  the principle of giving  aid  to  a laborer, who, suddenly  deprived of his livelihood through dismissal without sufficient notice, would have no means of  supporting himself  and family  until he had found another job.  This aid  is just  as necessary in the case of a laborer earning compensation on a  percentage basis  as it is where he is  paid a fixed  salary.   It  is, therefore, our  opinion that under the law as it  now stands  an employee  who has  been hired without a definite period and earning compensation, on a percentage  basis is, upon  being  dismissed without a month's previous notice, entitled to the month's compensation therein  provided for.</p>
<p>There is nothing  to the claim that  Malate Taxicab was deprived  of its  day  in  court  because the lower  court, instead of merely resolving the motion for dismissal, went further and decided the  case on  the  merits.  It is  clear from the record  that it was not the motion alone but the whole case that  was  submitted  when, after stipulating on the facts, the parties, thru  their respective attorneys, informed  the  court that with  the  said stipulation  they were submitting  the case for decision.  It may  be added that the stipulation of facts  is  comprehensive enough to be the basis for a decision  on the merits so  that the new trial asked for would  really be  unnecessary.</p>
<p>With respect to the claim  that the award  complained of is vague as to the number and identity of the awardees, suffice  it to say  that  the  number of drivers  affected is fixed in the stipulation of facts, and surely  Malate Taxicab cannot pretend not to know those who had been  employed by,  and worked for it as  drivers.   In  any event, should any question arise as to the identity of any of those drivers,  that matter  may  be taken  up with the  lower court when the time comes for implementing its decision.</p>
<p>The  lower court  awarded compensation equivalent  in amount to the minimum wage authorized by law.  In the absence of any  showing that the  awardees  were, before their dismissal,  earning more  or less than  that amount we see no jurisdiction for  changing the award.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the order  appealed  from  is affirmed  with costs.</p>
