In&nbsp; reply, plaintiffs&nbsp; contended,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the trial&nbsp;&nbsp; jingo&nbsp; so declared,&nbsp;&nbsp; that the&nbsp;&nbsp; five-year period&nbsp; began&nbsp; iron 1949 when&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; transfer had been officially recorded upon presentation of the aforesaid “extrajudicial partition”.<br><br>The main&nbsp; question in&nbsp; this&nbsp; appeal&nbsp;&nbsp; is whether&nbsp; the five-year period of&nbsp; redemption began from the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; execution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract&nbsp;&nbsp; (1941)&nbsp;&nbsp; or iron the&nbsp; date&nbsp; of&nbsp; its registration in the&nbsp; office&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the register of&nbsp;&nbsp; deeds&nbsp;&nbsp; (1949). There&nbsp;&nbsp; is no doubt&nbsp; that the&nbsp;&nbsp; conveyance&nbsp;&nbsp; to Melecia 3.&nbsp; Corpuz&nbsp; was fully executed in&nbsp; 1941,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed of&nbsp;&nbsp; sale&nbsp; having been&nbsp;&nbsp; approved by the&nbsp; Department .of Agriculture&nbsp;&nbsp; on April&nbsp; 22,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1941.<br><br>The lower court,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiffs,&nbsp;&nbsp; point&nbsp;&nbsp; out&nbsp;&nbsp; that,&nbsp;&nbsp; because&nbsp; the homestead was registered under the Torrens system, that&nbsp; section of Act 496 providing;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; "registration&nbsp;&nbsp; (in the&nbsp; registry&nbsp; of deeds)&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; operative&nbsp; act&nbsp; to convey and&nbsp; affect the&nbsp;&nbsp; land governs the&nbsp;&nbsp; situation;&nbsp;&nbsp; aid that o on consequently,&nbsp;&nbsp; the homo stead&nbsp; should be deemed to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; conveyed on June 23,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1949, from which date&nbsp; the five-year period&nbsp; should be&nbsp; computed.<br><br>This&nbsp;&nbsp; Court has resolved&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; very in sac&nbsp;&nbsp; in Galasinao&nbsp; v. Austria,&nbsp;&nbsp; L-7918,&nbsp; May&nbsp; 25,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1955.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp;&nbsp; Justice&nbsp; Labrador for this Court said:<br><blockquote>“Does&nbsp;&nbsp; 'conveyance' as&nbsp; used above&nbsp;&nbsp; (sec&nbsp; 119 C.&nbsp; Act 141) mean&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; actual&nbsp; sale or transfer,&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; does it mean&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; registration of&nbsp; the deed evidencing it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court&nbsp;&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp; 'conveyance'&nbsp; implies registration,&nbsp; because Section 50&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Land&nbsp; Registration Act provider that the act&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; registration shall be the operative&nbsp; act&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; convey and affect&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And plaintiffs-appellees&nbsp; argue&nbsp;&nbsp; in support&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; this&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; that an unregistered deed&nbsp; does not&nbsp; convey&nbsp; title or ownership bat&nbsp;&nbsp; operates&nbsp;&nbsp; only as&nbsp; an executory&nbsp; contract&nbsp; to convey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a&nbsp; construction is belied by the language&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law&nbsp; (Section&nbsp; 50,&nbsp;&nbsp; Land Registration Act)&nbsp;&nbsp; it self,&nbsp; which is&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>'x x x.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no deed x x&nbsp;&nbsp; x shall take effect&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; convoyance&nbsp;&nbsp; or bind the land,&nbsp; but&nbsp;&nbsp; shall&nbsp; operate&nbsp;&nbsp; only as a contract&nbsp; between&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; parties&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; as evidence&nbsp;&nbsp; of authority to the cleric or registry of&nbsp;&nbsp; deeds&nbsp; to make&nbsp;&nbsp; registration.x x x.', </blockquote>In a long&nbsp; line&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions we have&nbsp; held,&nbsp;&nbsp; following the language of the law, that as between the parties of a contract of sale registration is not necessary to make it valid and effective, for actual notice is equivalent to registration x x x.<br><br>It&nbsp; can&nbsp; be&nbsp; seen,&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; that in so far&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; homestead,&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Lagon,&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned, the conveyance mentioned in Section 119 of the Public land Law is the actual date thereof, and not the date of the registration of the deed of sale. x x x<br><br>As&nbsp; respects&nbsp; tic&nbsp;&nbsp; children&nbsp; of&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Lagon,&nbsp; the other&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiffs-appellees,&nbsp;&nbsp; they may not be&nbsp;&nbsp; considered&nbsp; third&nbsp; parties because&nbsp; there is a privity&nbsp; of Interest between&nbsp; them and&nbsp; their&nbsp; father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They only succeed to whatever rights their father had and what is valid and binding against him is also valid binding as against him is also valid and binding as against him is also valid binding as against them.” (Underscoring ours )<br></blockquote>Hence,&nbsp;&nbsp; it must&nbsp; be&nbsp; hold&nbsp; tint&nbsp; plaintiffs&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; lost&nbsp; their right&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; repurchase&nbsp;&nbsp; and their&nbsp; demand&nbsp; for consequential damages must&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessarily fail.<br><br>On the&nbsp;&nbsp; other hand&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; defendants'&nbsp;&nbsp; claim&nbsp;&nbsp; attorney's&nbsp; fees&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; expenses&nbsp; under Art.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2208 par. 4, New Civil Code Civil&nbsp; Code should not be granted, considering that our direct pronouncement on the issue was promulgated only on May 21, 1955, after the&nbsp;&nbsp; submission by plaintiffs&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp; printed brief.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed judgment will be reversed, and the defendants absolved from all liability. No costs. So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
