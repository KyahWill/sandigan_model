				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; certiorari&nbsp; to&nbsp; annul the&nbsp; order of the respondent judge directing execution&nbsp; of the&nbsp; supersedeas bond filed by the&nbsp; Luzon Surety Company, in Civil Case&nbsp; No. 3450 of the Negros Occidental&nbsp; court of first instance.<br><br>In&nbsp; that case&nbsp; it appears,&nbsp; judgment "was&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; on September 5, 1955,&nbsp; in favor&nbsp; of therein plaintiff&nbsp; Rieardo Nolan against&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Marino&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Rubin,&nbsp; rescinding the lease between the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; of&nbsp; Lot No.&nbsp; 1500&nbsp; of the Cadastral Survey of Pontevedra, declaring plaintiff's right to&nbsp; re-possess&nbsp; it,&nbsp; and ordering&nbsp; defendant to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; him P5,000.00 plus&nbsp; 100&nbsp; cavans of&nbsp; palay on&nbsp; or before&nbsp; the end&nbsp; of March&nbsp; 1956. <br><br>From&nbsp; such, decision defendant Marino P. Rubin&nbsp; took steps&nbsp; for&nbsp; an appeal; but before the approval thereof the plaintiff&nbsp; applied for&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; execution&nbsp; which&nbsp; the respondent&nbsp; judge&nbsp; authorized in&nbsp; his&nbsp; order&nbsp; dated&nbsp; October 13,&nbsp; 1955. <br><br>Upon being informed of&nbsp; the above order, the defendant Marino P. Rubin&nbsp; immediately filed&nbsp; a motion to stay the execution, attaching thereto&nbsp; a&nbsp; supersedeas&nbsp; bond,&nbsp;&nbsp; Annex C,&nbsp; subscribed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Luzon&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; as surety,&nbsp; the pertinent&nbsp; portions&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; stipulated: <br><br><blockquote>"Whereas,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; above-entitled case&nbsp; the&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp;&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Negros&nbsp; Occidental,&nbsp; Branch&nbsp; II, has&nbsp;&nbsp; ordered under&nbsp; date of&nbsp; October 13,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; the&nbsp; discretionary execution&nbsp; of the Decision&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; above-entitled&nbsp; case&nbsp; rendered on&nbsp; September 5,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; taken&nbsp; by&nbsp; the defendant to the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals; * * * <br><br>Whereas, the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; desires the stay&nbsp; of the execution of the&nbsp; judgment ordered on October 13,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; by filing&nbsp; a&nbsp; sufficient supcrsedeas bond in&nbsp; accordance with the provisions of Sec.&nbsp; 2 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court,&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to preserve&nbsp; the status quo of&nbsp; the parties pending&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Honorable Court of Appeals, <br><br>Now Therefore, in consideration&nbsp; of the premises and&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; such appeal by the defendant,&nbsp; I,&nbsp; Marino P.&nbsp; Rubin,&nbsp; as&nbsp; principal,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; LUZON&nbsp; SURETY COMPANY,&nbsp; INC., of Manila,&nbsp; thru its&nbsp;&nbsp; Bacolod Agency, at the City of&nbsp; Bacoiod, a corporation&nbsp; duly organized and existing under and by virtue&nbsp; of the laws of the&nbsp; Philippines, hereby undertakes and promise to pay the sum of six thousand pesos&nbsp; (P6,000.00)&nbsp; Philippine currency, to&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; stay and&nbsp; prevent the&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; execution of the&nbsp; said judgment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in the above-entitled case of September 5, 1955,&nbsp; and to pay all interests and costs down to the time of the final judgment of the action, if any." </blockquote><br>&nbsp;<br>When Rubin's motion was&nbsp; called for hearing on October 15,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; some negotiations&nbsp; took place between the contending&nbsp; attorneys,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a result&nbsp; of&nbsp; which&nbsp; an order was issued&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; judge&nbsp; which&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended&nbsp; later (October 21,1955), read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"When&nbsp; said motion was called&nbsp; for hearing on&nbsp; October 15, 1955, Atty.&nbsp; Plaridel&nbsp; Katalbas,&nbsp; appeared for the defendant&nbsp; and&nbsp; Atty. Rieardo&nbsp; Nolan,&nbsp; for and&nbsp; in&nbsp; behalf of himself,&nbsp; as plaintiff.&nbsp; Both attorneys stated&nbsp; in&nbsp; open court&nbsp; that they have&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; on the suspension of the execution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment until tile&nbsp; end of March, 1956, to&nbsp; give&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; an&nbsp; opportunity to&nbsp; harvest the&nbsp; palay&nbsp; from the land&nbsp; of the&nbsp; plaintiff;&nbsp; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; said&nbsp; month of&nbsp; March, 1956,&nbsp; or&nbsp; March&nbsp; 31,&nbsp; 1956, the&nbsp; said&nbsp; defendant would likewise&nbsp; pay the plaintiff&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of&nbsp; P5.000.00 and&nbsp; deliver the&nbsp; 100&nbsp; cavans&nbsp; of palay to said plaintiff or their corresponding value; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; superscdeas&nbsp; bond already filed by the&nbsp; defendant, and&nbsp; approved by the&nbsp; Court, to&nbsp; be&nbsp; declared&nbsp; cancelled&nbsp; and&nbsp; said defendant to withdraw&nbsp; the appeal interposed by him in this case, and,&nbsp; finally,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; would ask&nbsp; the&nbsp; sheriff to&nbsp; cancel the&nbsp; writ of execution&nbsp; of the judgment which said&nbsp; sheriff&nbsp; is in the&nbsp; process&nbsp; of&nbsp; executing, provided that the&nbsp; defendant shall pay to the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P6,000.00 and&nbsp; deliver to&nbsp; him&nbsp; 100 cavanes of palay on&nbsp; or before March 31,&nbsp; 1956,"</blockquote><br><br>Allegedly in pursuance of the above understanding Marino Rubin did not&nbsp; insist in the approval&nbsp; of his&nbsp; appeal papers,&nbsp; and&nbsp; complied&nbsp; with the decision by&nbsp; surrendering the&nbsp; land on February&nbsp; 20, 1956; but&nbsp; unfortunately&nbsp; at the end of March&nbsp; 1956 he failed to deliver to plaintiff P5,000.00 and twenty cavans&nbsp; of&nbsp; palay. <br><br>Whereupon plaintiff&nbsp; Nolan&nbsp; submitted on&nbsp; April 10, 1956 a motion praying for&nbsp; execution of the bond&nbsp; (Annex C). The Luzon Surety&nbsp; opposed the motion, calling the&nbsp; court's attention&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact that&nbsp; no appeal had&nbsp; taken place as&nbsp; contemplated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; bond, and that anyway&nbsp; it&nbsp; had already&nbsp; been cancelled as per&nbsp; order&nbsp; of October&nbsp; 21, 1955 <i>supra</i>.<br><br>On&nbsp; May 16, 1956, the&nbsp; respondent judge&nbsp; ordered ex- ecution&nbsp; against the&nbsp; Luzon&nbsp; Surety; wherefore&nbsp; the latter instituted&nbsp; the present petition.&nbsp; We issued, at petitioner's request, a preliminary injunction restraining the enforce- ment&nbsp; of such&nbsp; order. <br><br>The responsibility&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; surety&nbsp; never extends&nbsp; beyond the terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bond&nbsp; signed by it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; The bond here Annex C was avowedly to stay and prevent the immediate execution&nbsp; "in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to&nbsp; preserve&nbsp; the status quo&nbsp; of the parties pending the&nbsp; appeal to the&nbsp; Honorable&nbsp; Court of Appeals" and&nbsp; "in consideration of such&nbsp; appeal";&nbsp; all "in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of Sec.&nbsp; 2 of Rule 39 of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court". Assuming that by the&nbsp; reference to&nbsp; such section it became a part of&nbsp; the bond,&nbsp; Annex C, then the&nbsp; Luzon&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; in&nbsp; this case bound&nbsp; itself "for the performance of the judgment or&nbsp; order appealed from in&nbsp; case it&nbsp; be affirmed wholly or in part". <br><br>Now, it&nbsp; seems to us that as there&nbsp; had been no&nbsp; appeal, and the judgment had never been affirmed by the appellate court,&nbsp; liability of the surety never arose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Insisting in&nbsp; the surets^s&nbsp; liability, the&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; cite&nbsp; the case of&nbsp; Dugas&nbsp; vs. New York Casualty&nbsp; Co. 181 La.&nbsp; 322,&nbsp; 159 So.&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 572-575 wherein&nbsp; it&nbsp; was said in&nbsp; connection with a&nbsp; similar bond,<br><br><blockquote>"the&nbsp; appellant may render&nbsp; the surety liable as well by abandon- ing the appeal,&nbsp; as&nbsp; by&nbsp; prosecuting the&nbsp; appeal and then&nbsp; failing to&nbsp; satisfy whatever&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; may be rendered against&nbsp; him." </blockquote><br><br>From a reading of the&nbsp; case it appears that "abandoning the appeal" meant perfecting the appeal, and then&nbsp; <i>in the&nbsp; appellate court</i>,&nbsp; commit such neglect as to be considered an abandonment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruling is correct of&nbsp; course, because&nbsp; such abandonment&nbsp; will justify&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; of&nbsp; the appeal, which&nbsp; according&nbsp; to&nbsp; our precedents "amounts&nbsp; to&nbsp; an affirmance of the judgment".&nbsp;&nbsp; (Vacani vs. Llopis,&nbsp; 12 Phil. 7S4-758.) <br><br>But that situation&nbsp; does&nbsp; not obtain here.&nbsp; Rubin never perfected&nbsp; his&nbsp; appeal; never&nbsp; "abandoned"&nbsp; it&nbsp; and&nbsp; there- fore no affirmance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; judgment could&nbsp; be spelled out to impose liability&nbsp; on the&nbsp; surety.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the Luisiana Code contained&nbsp; this&nbsp; expression "that&nbsp; the surety&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; liable in&nbsp; his&nbsp; place"&nbsp; meaning "that the&nbsp; surety&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; whatever&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; the&nbsp; principal&nbsp; on the bond shall be liable for".&nbsp;&nbsp; This expression is found neither in the Luzon Surety's bond nor in&nbsp; sec.&nbsp; 2 of Rule 89. <br><br>From all the foregoing one&nbsp; may&nbsp; conclude,&nbsp; (1) because Rubin desisted from appealing with the&nbsp; consent of Nolan, the&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; for the&nbsp; surety's&nbsp; promise&nbsp; failed&nbsp; and therefore the bond never became binding; and (2) supposing&nbsp; the bond&nbsp; had become binding, the surety's liability never&nbsp; arose because&nbsp; its obligation was to perform the judgment&nbsp; "in case it be&nbsp; affirmed wholly or in&nbsp; part" and such judgment was&nbsp; <i>never affirmed</i>, since it never reached the appellate&nbsp; court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> <br><br><blockquote>"A contract of indemnity, and the obligation of&nbsp; a surety are strictly construed."&nbsp; (Asiatic Petroleum&nbsp; vs. De Pio, 46 Phil. 167; Standard Oil Co. vs. Cho Siong, 62 Phil. 612.) </blockquote><br><br>The respondents&nbsp; seem to entertain the belief that be- cause&nbsp; on&nbsp; March 30,&nbsp; 1956&nbsp; Marino&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Rubin failed to pay plaintiff&nbsp; (Nolan) P5,000.00 and to&nbsp; complete delivery of 100&nbsp; cavans the surety became liable.&nbsp; Nothing in the bond&nbsp; executed by the Luzon&nbsp; Surety would justify&nbsp; such belief.&nbsp; It does not mention the amounts,&nbsp; nor the&nbsp; date. The&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; of&nbsp; "both attorneys"&nbsp; at the hearing of October&nbsp; 15. 1955<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> did not&nbsp; operate&nbsp; to&nbsp; change the terms of the bond.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; true&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; of the surety was present at the hearing; but he&nbsp; denies having given his assent thereto&nbsp; and bearing in mind that a bond must be&nbsp; in writing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> any idea of amendment must be rejected. <br><br>In fact as we read&nbsp; the order of October 21, 1955, here- inabove transcribed, we incline to&nbsp; the view&nbsp; that&nbsp; it can- celled&nbsp; the bond—as&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; contends—because Rubin agreed to withdraw his appeal&nbsp; and promised&nbsp; to&nbsp; deliver oh&nbsp; or&nbsp; before March 31, 1956, to plaintiff P5,000.00&nbsp; and 100 cavans of&nbsp; palay.&nbsp; It says, both attorneys have agreed on&nbsp; the&nbsp; suspension of&nbsp; the execution; they&nbsp; also&nbsp; agreed that on&nbsp; March 31, 1956 the defendant would pay&nbsp; (money and palay); that&nbsp; the supersedeas&nbsp; bond already&nbsp; filed&nbsp; by defendant " (to) be declared cancelled" and said defendant to&nbsp; withdraw the&nbsp; appeal interposed etc. <br><br>The respondents argue that the order meant such cancellation and withdrawal shall take&nbsp; place only after Rubin shall have&nbsp; paid&nbsp; on March 31,&nbsp; 1956.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not&nbsp; the tenor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; order." Besides&nbsp; it&nbsp; couldn't&nbsp; have been&nbsp; the idea to&nbsp; incorporate a&nbsp; surplusage&nbsp; after&nbsp; payment,&nbsp; both the bond and&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal become <i>functus&nbsp; officio</i>, automatically set aside. <br><br>Consequently, for the reason&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Luzon&nbsp; Surety never&nbsp;&nbsp; became liable&nbsp;&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; its bond and/or said bond&nbsp; had&nbsp; been discharged by the order of October 21, 1955, it is our opinion that the order directing execution constituted&nbsp; a clear&nbsp; error amounting to excess of jurisdiction&nbsp; or grave abuse of discretion&nbsp; corrigible&nbsp; by eertiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup>&nbsp; Such order of execution is&nbsp; revoked, even&nbsp; as the preliminary injunction&nbsp; heretofore issued is made permanent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Ricardo Nolan.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered. <br><br><i>Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A.
