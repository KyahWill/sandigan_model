				G.R. No. L-1792, January 28, 1948</h4>
				<H3>FLAVIANO ROMERO, PETITIONER, VS. SOTERO RODAS, LADISLAO PASICOLAN, AND DOLORES P. DE ESPIDIDO, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petitioner began this special civil action of cetiorari to impede his 
ejectment from the premises at 1547 Rizal Avenue, Manila, which was decreed by 
the Honorable Sotero Rodas, in civil case No. 328O of the Manila Court of First 
Instance.
<p>It appears that in a detainer litigation between Dolores P. de Espedido and 
Flaviano Romero, — petitioner here — in the judge of the municipal court of this 
city rendered, on July 23, 1947, a decision ordering the defendant therein 
Romero to return the aforesaid premises to plaintiff espedido, and to pay her 
"as reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of said commercial 
premises and by way of damages, the sum of P200 a month from February 1, 1947." 
The defendant appealed, and filed a supersedeas bond for one thousand pesos.</p>
<p>During the pendency of the suit in the municipal court the defendant Romero 
deposited therein the amount of P240 for rents. After appealing to the Court of 
First Instance he failed to make any other deposit for rents. Wherefore, on 
October 17, 1947, the landlord (Espedido) prayed for execution in accordance 
with Rule 72, section 8; and her prayer was granted by Judge Rodas, 
notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of said tenant, who immediately resorted 
to this Court for a preliminary injunction and a writ of certiorari annulling 
the ouster decree.</p>
<p>Romero's objection, formulated in the lower court and repeated here, may 
practically be reduced to four propositions:</p><p></p><blockquote>(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) The amount of P200 ordered by the municipal court to be paid monthly was 
composed of P120 as rent and P80 as damages;<p></p><p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) The tenant is obliged to deposit during the pendency of his appeal the 
monthly amount of rents — not the damages;</p><p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) Inasmuch as the tenant (herein petitioner) had deposited P240 and filed a 
bond for P1,000 or a total of P1,240 (sic), he had in effect deposited the rent 
for ten months from February to November, 1947; and</p><p>(<span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>) Consequently, when the motion for execution was filed in October, 1947, the 
tenant was not yet in arrears.</p></blockquote><p>After considering the arguments on both sides, we reach the conclusion that 
the order of execution was properly issued under the Rules of Court and the 
pertinent decisions. The second proposition of petitioner is undeniable. The 
first may be accepted for the <em>purposes of argument</em> only, although there 
is good reason to doubt it. But the inference in the third and the conclusion in 
the fourth must be disputed and overruled, because we have heretofore held that 
<em>besides the supersedeas bond</em> the tenant-appellant in ejectment cases 
must deposit every month the rents adjudicated<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span>, and that appellant's failure to pay such 
monthly charges will entitle the plaintiff-landlord to immediate execution of 
the ouster decree of the municipal court.<span class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>True it is that Republic Act No. 66 directs that no tenant shall be ejected 
for non-payment of rents unless such non-payment is deliberate or intentional; 
but that law is inapplicable here, according to some members because the 
building is commercial, and according to others because it may not be invoked at 
that stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Petition denied. With costs.</p><em>Moran, C.J., Feria,</em> and <em>Pablo,
