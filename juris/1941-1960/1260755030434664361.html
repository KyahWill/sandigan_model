				G.R. No. L-12140, April 29, 1959</h4>
				<H3>IN RE: CORRECTION OF ENTRY OF CIVIL REGISTER PERTAINING TO CITIZENSHIP OF  ROSA  TAN, MINOR.  ALFONSO TAN SU, PETITIONER AND APPELLEE, VS. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, OPPOSITOR  AND  APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Tan Su filed in the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Cebu a petition&nbsp; praying that the Civil Register&nbsp; of Cebu City be ordered to correct the citizenship of his minor daughter Rosa Tan from Chinese to Filipino in the Civil Registry. In spite of&nbsp; the&nbsp; opposition of&nbsp; the fiscal, the trial&nbsp; court, after hearing,&nbsp; rendered decision&nbsp; ordering the Civil Registrar to change not only the citizenship&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rosa Tan but also that&nbsp; of her&nbsp; father&nbsp; and her&nbsp; mother&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Civil Registry from Chinese to Filipino.&nbsp; The fiscal in due time interposed the present appeal.<br><br>The purpose of the&nbsp; petition of Tan&nbsp; Su is to&nbsp; correct the&nbsp; citizenship of his&nbsp; daughter&nbsp; Rosa&nbsp; Tan that&nbsp; appears in the Civil Registry of Cebu from Chinese to&nbsp; Filipino contending&nbsp; that,&nbsp; in&nbsp; making said entry,&nbsp; the midwife of Rosa when she was born gave&nbsp; wrongly the information that&nbsp; she&nbsp; was a&nbsp; Chinese&nbsp; citizen.&nbsp; The Government opposed&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition on&nbsp; the ground&nbsp; that the&nbsp; error&nbsp; to be corrected is not merely clerical&nbsp; but one that affects the status or&nbsp; nationality of Rosa Tan, as&nbsp; well&nbsp; as&nbsp; of her father and mother, and hence it cannot be threshed out by a mere&nbsp; petition but&nbsp; in an&nbsp; appropriate action.<br><br>There is merit in&nbsp; this&nbsp; opposition.&nbsp; In the case of Ty Kong&nbsp; Tin <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; of the Philippines, 50&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz., No. 3, p.&nbsp; 1077,&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts of which are similar to those involved in the instant case, this Court said:<br><blockquote>"It is our&nbsp; opinion that&nbsp; the petition&nbsp; under consideration does not merely call for a correction of a clerical error.<span style="font-style: italic;"> It involves a matter which concerns the&nbsp; citizenship not&nbsp; only of petitioner but of children</span>.&nbsp; It is therefore an&nbsp; important&nbsp; controversial&nbsp; matter which can and should only be threshed out in an appropriate action. The philosophy behind this requirement lies in the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that the books&nbsp; making up the civil&nbsp; register&nbsp; and&nbsp; all&nbsp; documents&nbsp; relating thereto&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be considered public documents&nbsp; and shall be prima facie evidence of&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts&nbsp; therein&nbsp; contained' (Article&nbsp; 410, new Civil Code), and&nbsp; if the entries in the civil register could be corrected or changed through a mere summary&nbsp; proceeding, and not through&nbsp; an&nbsp; appropriate&nbsp; action wherein&nbsp; all parties who may be affected&nbsp; by the entries are notified&nbsp; or&nbsp; represented&nbsp; we would&nbsp; set wide open the&nbsp; door to fraud&nbsp; or&nbsp; other&nbsp; mischief&nbsp; the&nbsp; consequence of which might be detrimental and far reaching.&nbsp; It is for these reasons that the law has placed the necessary safeguards to forestall such eventuality that even on matters which call for a correction&nbsp; of&nbsp; clerical&nbsp; mistakes&nbsp; the&nbsp; intervention&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; courts was found&nbsp; necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; innovation not&nbsp; originally&nbsp; found in the&nbsp; law&nbsp; which&nbsp; placed this&nbsp; matter&nbsp; exclusively&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; sound judgment and discretion of the&nbsp; civil registrars.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; was&nbsp; found by&nbsp; Congress&nbsp; unwise and&nbsp; risky in view&nbsp; of the far reaching importance of the subjects&nbsp; covered&nbsp; by the civil register.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; under the&nbsp; present&nbsp; innovation the law&nbsp; even exacts&nbsp; civil&nbsp; liability from the&nbsp; civil&nbsp; registrar&nbsp; for&nbsp; any unauthorized alteration, which shows the concern of Congress in&nbsp; maintaining the&nbsp; integrity&nbsp; and genuiness of the entries contained in our civil registers.&nbsp; (Article 411, New Civil Code)."&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; ours.)<br></blockquote>This&nbsp; Court has also&nbsp; had occasion to&nbsp; point out&nbsp; for the guidance of the&nbsp; public what clerical&nbsp; errors may&nbsp; be corrected&nbsp; under Article&nbsp; 4-12&nbsp; of&nbsp; the new Civil Code.&nbsp; Thus, in&nbsp; the&nbsp; case&nbsp; of Ansaldo <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines, 102 Phil., 1046, this&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; through&nbsp; Mr. Justice&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; made the following comment:<br><blockquote>"For&nbsp; the&nbsp; information of&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties concerned, and for the guidance of the&nbsp; public in general, we may&nbsp; venture&nbsp; the opinion that the&nbsp; clerical&nbsp; errors which&nbsp; might&nbsp; be&nbsp; corrected&nbsp; through judicial sanction under Article&nbsp; 412 of the New Civil Code, would be those harmless&nbsp; and&nbsp; innocuous&nbsp; changes,&nbsp; such&nbsp; as,&nbsp; correction&nbsp; of a&nbsp; name that is nearly misspelled,&nbsp; occupation of the parents, etc., but for changes&nbsp; involving the civil status of the parents,&nbsp; their nationality or citizenship, those are grave and important matters which may have a bearing and effect on&nbsp; the citizenship&nbsp; and nationality not only&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; parents, but of the offsprings&nbsp; and&nbsp; to seek said changes,&nbsp; it is necessary to&nbsp; file&nbsp; a&nbsp; proper&nbsp; suit wherein&nbsp; not only the&nbsp; State, but&nbsp; also&nbsp; all parties concerned&nbsp; and affected should&nbsp; be parties defendants or respondents,&nbsp; and evidence&nbsp; should&nbsp; be submitted,&nbsp; either&nbsp; to&nbsp; support the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; of the petition&nbsp; or complaint,&nbsp; or also&nbsp; to&nbsp; disapprove the&nbsp; same so that&nbsp; any order&nbsp; or decision in the case may be made with due process of law and&nbsp; on the basis of facts&nbsp; proven.&nbsp; Then and only&nbsp; then may the change&nbsp; or changes be made in the entry in a civil&nbsp; register that will&nbsp; affect or even&nbsp; determine conclusively the&nbsp; citizenship&nbsp; or&nbsp; nationality&nbsp; of a&nbsp; person therein&nbsp; involved."<br></blockquote>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, with costs against appellee.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span>&nbsp; concur.</div>
