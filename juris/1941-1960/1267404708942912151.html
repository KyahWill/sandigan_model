				<H3>HIPOLITA ASEJO, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. BONIFACIO LEONOSO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE.

				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from an order of the Court of First Instance of Masbate, 
the Honorable Judge Vicente Varela presiding, dismissing the complaint on the 
ground that "the plaintiff had previously waived all her rights and claims over 
the property in question." This was a second order, modifying or replacing the 
first which gave as reason for the dismissal, that the plaintiff lacked legal 
capacity to sue.
<p>The suit has been brought by Hipolita Asejo against Bonifacio Leonoso to 
recover, under a first cause of action, a parcel of land planted with coconut 
trees and, under a second cause of action, the value of its products. Another 
action had previously been instituted by the present defendant, Bonifacio 
Leonoso, against the present plaintiff and three others, all relatives of 
Hipolita Asejo's deceased husband. The purpose of the first action was to 
foreclose a mortgage constituted on the land that is the subject matter of the 
second. The first suit was not decided on the merits. Although the decision 
"absolved the defendant, without costs," it was in reality a dismissal of the 
complaint without prejudice, on the ground that the judicial administrator of 
the mortgagor's estate was not made defendant.</p>
<p>The dismissal of the case at bar was ordered on a motion for that purpose, 
which alleges three of the grounds enumerated in Section 1 of Rule 8. One of the 
grounds so alleged is that the plaintiff's demand has been released. This 
remains as the sole basis of the dismissal. The objection that the plaintiff has 
no legal capacity to sue has, it seems, been given up as unfounded, as indeed it 
is.</p>
<p>Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 8 outline the procedure in cases where one or more 
of the grounds of dismissal are asserted. Two courses are open: (<i>a</i>) to 
deny or grant the motion or allow amendment of pleading; (<i>b</i>) to "defer 
the hearing and determination of the motion until the trial if the ground 
alleged therein does not appear to be indubitable." Any of the grounds to 
dismiss which has not been brought before the court by motion may be pleaded as 
an affirmative defense. In either case there must be a hearing. And of necessity 
the hearing, although called preliminary, should be conducted as ordinary 
hearings: the parties should be allowed to present evidence and the evidence 
should be taken down. Otherwise in the event of appeal from an order of 
dismissal, as in this case, the appellate court would have no means to judge the 
legality of the proceedings and the sufficiency of the proofs on which the order 
is predicated. If after the hearing the court is of the opinion that the ground 
alleged in the motion to dismiss or in the answer is not indubitable, it shall 
defer the determination of the question until the trial.</p>
<p>The lower court dismissed the complaint on the strength of Exhibit B. What 
legal or evidentiary force does this exhibit possess? Is it "indubitable" 
necessitating no extraneous evidence? "Indubitable" is variously defined in 42 
Corpus Juris Secundom, 1370 as "something which cannot be doubted; also certain 
and unquestionable; without doubt."</p>
<p>Exhibit B is in the nature of a quitclaim deed by which Hipolita Asejo and 
her coheirs are said to have renounced all rights and interests in the property 
mortgaged by Asejo's deceased husband to Bonifacio Leonoso. It was introduced in 
evidence in the mortgage foreclosure suit. In that case, according to the 
decision rendered therein, Hipolita Asejo testified, among other things, that 
there had been an agreement entered into in the month of March 1935 between her 
and Leonoso, stipulating that the latter should reimburse himself for the amount 
of his credit out of the products of the mortgaged land, possession of which had 
been turned over by her to the mortgagee. The court did not give credit to that 
testimony, saying that it was belied by Exhibit B. The decision commented that 
Asejo's oral evidence could not prevail over Exhibits A and B.</p>
<p>Exhibit B does not, in and of itself, establish beyond doubt the truth of the 
transaction recited therein. Although it purports to have been subscribed and 
sworn to before a justice of the peace, it does not preclude the possibility 
that, for some reason or other, it does not reflect the real intention of the 
plaintiff. The document is not one to which no possible objection could be made, 
however trivial. For once, the plaintiff at bar repudiated it in one of her 
pleadings in the prior case, in which she was a defendant, stating that "If she 
ever did give her consent at all (to that document), such consent must have been 
obtained by the plaintiff (defendant herein) by means of fraud and deceit," The 
bringing of the suit is itself a clear manifestation of her negation to 
recognize the binding effect of Exhibit B. Under the circumstances, it would 
have been better practice to postpone consideration of this matter until the 
trial.</p>
<p>The plaintiff should at least have been accorded a hearing. This is the least 
she is entitled to. And this is true regardless of any strong opinion the court 
may have as to the truthfulness of the document. No such hearing was held. 
Without hearing the plaintiff would be barred from pursuing her action and is to 
be deprived of what she claims to be her property without being given an 
opportunity to affirm or deny the validity of Exhibit B.</p>
<p>Perhaps His Honor relied on the finding of the court in the case for the 
foreclosure of the mortgage. If the court <i>a quo</i> took that finding as 
concluding the present demand, it is gravely mistaken. The first case, it has 
been seen, was dismissed without prejudice. According to Section 44 of Rule 39, 
the order or judgment of a court is conclusive between the parties only on the 
matter directly adjudged. And Section 45 of the same Rule provides that that 
only is being conclusively adjudged in a former judgment which appears upon its 
face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included 
therein or necessary thereto. There was no adjudication whatsoever in the 
previous case. The dismissal left the parties in <i>status quo</i>.</p>
<p>The court's finding of fact in the previous case was a surplusage. There was 
no need to make it. Even if the court thought it proper or necessary to state 
its opinion on the evidence, the opinion could not produce any adverse effect on 
the rights of the defendants over the property in controversy in the face of the 
dismissal of the complaint which is the controlling part of the decision.</p>
<p>In view of these considerations, the appealed order of dismissal is reversed 
and the case is remanded to the court of origin for further and appropriate 
proceedings in accordance with this decision, with costs of this appeal charged 
to the appellee.</p><i>Paras, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon,</i> and <i>Hontiveros, 
JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
