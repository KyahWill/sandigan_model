				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review by certiorari of a decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pertinent&nbsp; facts are&nbsp; set forth in said decision, from which we quote:<br><blockquote>"This case being the sequel to, and aftermath of, a previous litigation between the parties that reached the&nbsp; Supreme Court through the former Court of Appeal's,&nbsp; it becomes necessary to restate the essential&nbsp; antecedent facts to view the issues in proper perspective. For this purpose, it is important to recall that on "August 26, 1931, Victorino&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Guevara, a&nbsp; resident of Bayambang, Pangasinan, executed&nbsp; a will&nbsp; (Exhibit A), distributing assorted movables and a residential lot&nbsp; among his children, Rosario and Ernesto Guevara,&nbsp; and his stepchildren, Vivencio, Eduvigis, Dionista, Candida, and Pio Guevara. To his second wife Augustia Posadas, the testator bequeathed, in addition to various movables, a portion of 25 hectares to lie .taken out of a 259 odd hectare parcel outlined in Plan Psu-68618, plus another five&nbsp; (5) hectares in settlement, of her widow's usufruct. The balance of the 259 odd hectares ho distributed as follows:<br>100&nbsp; hectares&nbsp; reserved&nbsp; for&nbsp; disposal during the testator's lifetime and for payment of his&nbsp; debts&nbsp; and family expenses;<br><br>108.0854 hectares to&nbsp; his legitimate son Ernesto&nbsp; Guevara, including therein 43.2342 hectares by way of mejora;<br><br>21.6171 hectares to 'mi hija natural reconocida Rosario Guavara.' Ernesto Guevara was&nbsp; appointed&nbsp; executor&nbsp; without bond. <br><br>On July&nbsp; 12, 1933, the&nbsp; same testator executed&nbsp; a deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale in favor of Ernesto&nbsp; Guevara, conveying to the&nbsp; latter the southern half of 'the 259-hectare lot heretofore mentioned, and expressly recognized Ernesto&nbsp; Guevara&nbsp; as&nbsp; owner of the northern half.<br><br>Prior&nbsp; to&nbsp; this sale, oh November 1,&nbsp; 1932,&nbsp; Victorino and his son Ernesto&nbsp; had jointly applied for registration&nbsp; of the big parcel&nbsp; (case No. 15174), but in&nbsp; view of the sale from the former to&nbsp; the latter, the decree was issued&nbsp; in the name of&nbsp; Ernesto Guevara exclusively and for the whole tract a certificate of title&nbsp; (No. 51691&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pangawnan) being issued in his sole&nbsp; name on October 12, 1933.<br><br>Fifteen days previously,&nbsp; i.e., on September 27, 1933,&nbsp; Victorinc Guevara died,&nbsp; but his ¦will was not filed&nbsp; for probate.&nbsp; About four years later,&nbsp; Rbsario Guevara, claiming; to be a recognized natural child of the deceased Victorino,&nbsp; and on the assumption that&nbsp; he had died intestate,&nbsp; brought'&nbsp; suit against' Ernesto&nbsp; Guevara&nbsp; to recover. 423,492 square&nbsp; meters of the&nbsp; tract covered by&nbsp; certificate of title No.&nbsp; 51691 as the portion that&nbsp; should correspond to her&nbsp; (Rosario). by way of&nbsp; legitime.<br><br>The case&nbsp; reached the former Court of Appeals&nbsp; in due&nbsp; course and was decided in Rosario&nbsp; Guevara's&nbsp; favor (Exhibit&nbsp; E)';&nbsp; but&nbsp; upon certiorari, the&nbsp; Supreme Court rnodified&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment in&nbsp; December, 1043, as follows (Exhibit F);<br><blockquote>'Wherefore, that part of ,the&nbsp; decision of the Court&nbsp; of Appeals which declares in effect that notwithstanding exhibit&nbsp; 2 and the issuance of original&nbsp; certificate of title No, 51691&nbsp; in the name of Ernesto&nbsp; M. Guevara;&nbsp; one-half of the&nbsp; land described in said 1 certificate of&nbsp; title belongs to the estate of Victorino L. Guevara and: the other half to Ernesto M. Guevara in consideration&nbsp; of the latter's assumption of the obligation to&nbsp; pay all the debts of the&nbsp; deceased, is hereby affirmed;&nbsp; but the Judgment of said court insofar&nbsp; as it awarded any relief&nbsp; to the respondent Rosario Guevara, in this action is hereby reversed and set aside, and the parties&nbsp; are hereby ordered to present the document Exhibit A to the proper) court for probate in accordance with law, without prejudice to such action as the provincial&nbsp; fiscal Pangasinan may take against the responsible party or&nbsp; parties under section 4 of Rule 76.&nbsp; After the said document, is approve and allowed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; court as the last will&nbsp; and testament of the deceased Victorino L. Guevara, the heirs and legatees herein named may take such action, judicial or extra judicial,&nbsp; as necessary to partition the estate of the testator, taking&nbsp; in consideration. the pronouncements&nbsp; made in part II of this opinion No -finding as to costs&nbsp; in&nbsp; any of the three instances.' (Appellant's&nbsp; Brief, pp. 13-14.)<br></blockquote>Claiming to act pursuant to the foregoing decision Rosario Guevara commenced on October 5, 1945,&nbsp; special proceedings No. 2646 in the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Pangasinan for&nbsp; the probate of the will of Victorino Guevara.&nbsp;&nbsp; In paragraph 10 of the petition, it was alleged:<br><blockquote>'10. Que dicho testamento, o sus disposiciones testanientarias, ha sido de,&nbsp; jure revocado,&nbsp; o revoeados, en&nbsp; eua la parcela de terreno de 259 hectareas descrita&nbsp; en&nbsp; dicho testamento,&nbsp; por haber el testador enajenado o dispuesto intervivos misma en la forma mencionada en&nbsp; las&nbsp; tres decisiones sup meneionadas; y&nbsp; que la solieitante&nbsp; pide&nbsp; l<span style="font-style: italic;">a&nbsp; legalizacio</span> testamento tan solo&nbsp; para&nbsp; los&nbsp; efectos del reconocimiento&nbsp; de hija natural&nbsp; hecha en dicho testamento&nbsp; a favor de la demandante y en obediencia al mandato de la Corte Suprema en su decision supra.'&nbsp; (Record on Appeal, p.&nbsp; 5.)<br></blockquote>Notice of the petition having been&nbsp; duly&nbsp; published pursuant to Rule of Court 77,. section 4,&nbsp; Ernesto Guevara&nbsp; appeared and opposed the&nbsp; probate.&nbsp; Pedro L.&nbsp; Quinto,&nbsp; counsel for Rosarioin theformer litigation,&nbsp; was&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; to intervene in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; his recorded attorney's&nbsp; lien.<br><br>On January 31, 1946,&nbsp; Ernesto. Guevara, through counsel, filed a motion to&nbsp; dismiss the petition on' the grounds that (<i>a</i> petition itself alleged that the will was revoked;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>b</i>) that 'whatever right to probate the parties may have has&nbsp; already&nbsp; prescribe (Record on Appeal,, p. 14);&nbsp; and&nbsp; (<i>c</i>)&nbsp; that the purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; th probate was, solely&nbsp; to have petitioner Rosario declared&nbsp; an acknowledged&nbsp; natural child of the deceased. <br><br>By order&nbsp; of&nbsp; December 9, 1946, Judge Sotero&nbsp; Rodas denied&nbsp; the motion, to&nbsp; dismiss; but upon motion of reconsideratio Judge Mainalac of the same&nbsp; court, on June 23, 1937, reconsidaration set aside the previous resolution&nbsp; and ordered the petition dismissed on the&nbsp; ground that Rosario Guevara's petition&nbsp; did&nbsp; not for&nbsp; the probate&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> of the will,&nbsp; contrary to the order of Supreme Court;&nbsp; that her&nbsp; right to petition for the probate&nbsp; o testament . of&nbsp; Victorino L. Guevara had&nbsp; prescribed; and that&nbsp; her&nbsp; action for judicial declaration of acknowledgment had likewise prescribed. <br><br>An&nbsp; amended petition for the probate of the will&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> in toto </span>and another petition to reconsider the previous order were subsequently denied; the former on the ground, that there&nbsp; was a radical change of&nbsp; theory&nbsp; from that embodied&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; original petition,&nbsp; and the second for the same reasons stated&nbsp; in the order of June, 23,&nbsp; 1947. Rosario L,&nbsp; Guevara and&nbsp; Pedro L. Quinto thereupon brought the case-on appeal to this Court,&nbsp; assigning no less than&nbsp; twenty&nbsp; (20) alleged errors committed by the court below."&nbsp; (Guevara&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Guevara, C.A.—G. R.&nbsp; No. 5416-R, promulgated December 26, 1951; see Appendix to brief&nbsp; for the petitioner-appellant, pp. 1-6.)<br></blockquote>The dispositive&nbsp; part of the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"The order of dismissal of the petition&nbsp; for probate is reversed and the&nbsp; court of origin ordered to reinstate the&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; and to&nbsp; hear and decide whether the will of Victorino Guevara, deceased, should be allowed to probate.&nbsp; Costs&nbsp; against appellees in&nbsp; both&nbsp; instances." (<i>Ibid.</i>)<br></blockquote>In&nbsp; his appeal therefrom, petitioner&nbsp; Ernesto&nbsp; M. Guevara raises the following questions, to wit:&nbsp; (a) Did respondents herein'duly&nbsp; perfect their&nbsp; appeal from the decision of. the , Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Fangasinan?&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Did the Court qf Appeals&nbsp; have jurisdiction to&nbsp; entertain said appeal?&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Is the petition for probate of the alleged will of the deceased Victorino L,&nbsp; Guevara barred by&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute of limitations?<br><br>(1) With reference to&nbsp; the first&nbsp; question, petitioner has submitted the following statement<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> of the steps taken since June&nbsp; 23, 1947,&nbsp; date of the resolution of Judge&nbsp; Manalac, dismissing the&nbsp; petition for probate&nbsp; of&nbsp; the last&nbsp; will and testament of Victoriano L.

Guevara&nbsp; filed,&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; Appeals, a motion praying that the appeal be dismissed:<br>&nbsp;<br>"(<i>a</i>) Because due to the&nbsp; appellant's&nbsp; many and repeated dilatory tactics, the prosecution of their appeal&nbsp; has been&nbsp; unduly and&nbsp; unreasonably delayed for a period&nbsp; which should strike anyone&nbsp; as&nbsp; totally without justification.&nbsp; The resolution appealed from was dictated by the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; on&nbsp; June 23,&nbsp; 1947, so&nbsp; that&nbsp; a&nbsp; period of over <i>two</i> (2) years and <i>nine </i> (9)&nbsp; months until the date of this writing has elapsed, thus&nbsp; establishing a record-holding delay which should not be sanctioned by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Courts&nbsp; as&nbsp; prejudicial to the: administration of justice.<br><br>"(<i>b</i>) Because appellants, in violation of Rule&nbsp; 48, section&nbsp; 3, did not diligently prosecute their appeal by failing to&nbsp; have the&nbsp; record sent Up to this&nbsp; Honorable Court within thirty (30) days from the time their Second Re-amended Record on&nbsp; Appeal was approved on September 28, 1949; and it was only so transmitted on December&nbsp; 8, 1949, that is after the lapse of two (2)&nbsp; months and ten (10)&nbsp; days.<br><br>" (<i>c</i>) Because, at&nbsp; any&nbsp; rate, the first Amended&nbsp; Joint Record on Appeal was filed beyond the extension granted by the Court and, consequently, the appellants' right to appeal has lapsed."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exhibit A, pp. 1-2).<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals denied said motion to&nbsp; dismiss for the following reasons:<br><blockquote>"A&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; question was posed by&nbsp; the appellee who prayed for the dismissal of the appeal on the ground that petitioners-appellants had unreasonably delayed the&nbsp; perfection of the appeal,&nbsp; as the Second Re-amended&nbsp; Joint Record&nbsp; on Appeal was&nbsp; not certified to this Court until December, 1949.&nbsp; After considering the voluminous record, and the arguments of both parties, "we are of the&nbsp; opinion that both parties have contributed to the delay with lengthy&nbsp; memoranda, and repeated motions and objections.&nbsp; Moreover, the&nbsp; points in question are important enough to deserve adequate&nbsp; consideration upon the merits.&nbsp; Wherefore, the motion to dismiss the&nbsp; appeal should be, and is hereby, overruled and denied."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Appendix&nbsp; to&nbsp; Brief for the Petitioner-Appellant, pp. 6-7.)<br></blockquote>It is urged by petitioner herein that respondents' appeal from the decision of the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Panga sinan had not been duly perfected because:&nbsp; (<i>a</i>) the original of the record on appeal did&nbsp; not comply&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Rules of Court;&nbsp; (<i>b</i>)&nbsp; the record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal was filed after the lapse of the reglementary period; (<i>c</i>) there has&nbsp; been an unprecedented delay in the filing of a satisfactory record on appeal;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (<i>d</i>) the appeal should be deemed&nbsp; abandoned for violation of Rule 48,&nbsp; section 3, of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The first&nbsp; ground is predicated upon the&nbsp; fact that, instead&nbsp; of transcribing the&nbsp; motions,&nbsp; petitions,&nbsp;&nbsp; orders and resolutions incorporated in the original record on appeal, respondents&nbsp; herein&nbsp; merely attached to the original&nbsp; copy of said record on appeal,&nbsp; filed&nbsp; with the Court&nbsp; of First Instance of Pangasinan, their own copies of said motions, petitions, orders and resolutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the copy of said record on appeal&nbsp; furnished to&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; herein did not contain&nbsp; or enclose the aforementioned parts&nbsp; of the record.&nbsp; It appears, however, that the respondents&nbsp; were given&nbsp; several extensions&nbsp; of time within which to comply with the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court and that respondents eventually did so.&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp; being no&nbsp; question about&nbsp; the authority of the court of first instance&nbsp; to grant said extensions of time, it is clear that the" first ground, relied&nbsp; upon by petitioner herein, is untenable.<br><br>In support of the second ground, it is alleged:&nbsp; (<i>a</i>)&nbsp; that the original record on appeal was filed by Pedro C.&nbsp; Quinto only, and&nbsp; does not inure to the benefit of Rosario Guevara; and&nbsp; (<i>b</i>) that respondents had lost their right to&nbsp; appeal by the lapse of the&nbsp; reglementary period.&nbsp; As regards the first proposition,&nbsp; petitioner asserts that respondent Pedro C. Quinto&nbsp; had withdrawn his appearance as&nbsp; counsel for respondent Rosario&nbsp; Guevara; that Quinto had, thereafter, intervened in the' case <i>in his own behalf,</i> in&nbsp; order&nbsp; to enforce&nbsp; his&nbsp; attorney's lien,&nbsp; as&nbsp; former counsel&nbsp; for Rosario Guevara;&nbsp; that, consequently, the&nbsp; original record on&nbsp; appeal and the petitions for extension of time to file an amended record on&nbsp; appeal, filed by Pedro C. Quinto, were good&nbsp; only insofar as <i>he</i> is concerned, and cannot profit Rosario&nbsp; Guevara,&nbsp; she having&nbsp; ceased to be his client&nbsp; long before the filing&nbsp; of said original record on&nbsp; appeal and petitions for extension of time; that this interest in the case arises from his rights as former attorney for respondent Rosario&nbsp; Guevara, and, as such, is subordinate to, and dependent upon, the&nbsp; interest therein&nbsp; of said Rosario Guevara and&nbsp; the&nbsp; success of her claim therein; and that, her&nbsp; appeal not having been duly perfected, his appeal&nbsp; must be&nbsp; deemed&nbsp; to have no legal effect.&nbsp; There is no merit in this pretense, for it appears, at the foot of Said record on&nbsp; appeal, that Pedro C. Quinto had filed the same,&nbsp; "for himself as&nbsp; appellant <i>and in behalf of Rosario Guevara,</i> who authorized him to perfect the appeal for both appellants," and that similar statements were&nbsp; made in the body and at the foot of said petitions for extension of time.&nbsp; It is clear, therefore, that the aforementioned record on&nbsp; appeal and motions should be deemed submitted, also, by respondent Rosario Guevara. The&nbsp; position then&nbsp; hela by Pedro&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Quinto, as special ( prosecutor in the office of the&nbsp; Solicitor General, did not nullify hia aforesaid acts on&nbsp; behalf of Rosario&nbsp; Guevara. Besides,&nbsp; said acts&nbsp; would seem to&nbsp; have been performed by him, more as attorney-in-fact&nbsp; than as counsel for Rosario Guevara,&nbsp; and this&nbsp; merely&nbsp; in connection&nbsp; with&nbsp; the perfection of her appeal.&nbsp; We do not find therein anything objectionable, either legally or&nbsp; morally, in the light of the circumstances surrounding the case.<br><br>The second proposition is based upon the following reasons ;<br><br>(<i>a</i>) The aforementioned&nbsp; record on appeal and motions for extension of&nbsp; time filed by Quinto on behalf of Rosario Guevara did not inure to her benefit, for which reason the reglementary period to appeal had expired before the perfection of her appeal.&nbsp; For the reasons already&nbsp; adverted to, this argument ia clearly untenable.<br><br>(<i>b</i>) The petition for reconsideration filed by respondents on July 14, 1947, did not suspend the running of the period to perfect the record on appeal, because said petition did not comply with the provisions of&nbsp; Rule 37, section&nbsp; 1, of the Rules of Court, reading as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"Within&nbsp; thirty days&nbsp; after notice&nbsp; of the judgment in&nbsp; an&nbsp; action, the aggrieved party&nbsp; may move the trial court to set&nbsp; aside the judgment and grant a new trial for one or more of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of said party:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) Fraud,&nbsp; accident, mistake or excusable&nbsp; negligence which ordinary prudence could&nbsp; not have guarded against and by&nbsp; reason of which such aggrieved party has probably been impaired in his rights;<br><br>(<i>b</i>) Newly discovered evidence, -which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered, and produced at the trial, and which if presented would&nbsp; probably alter the result;<br><br>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp; Because excessive damages have been awarded, or the evidence was insufficient to justify the decision, or it is against the law."<br></blockquote>Said petition for reconsideration appears, however,&nbsp; to be predicated, in effect, upon the ground that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision of the court of first instance, and that&nbsp; said decision is contrary to law.&nbsp; It partakes, therefore, of the nature of a&nbsp; motion for new trial, stating specifically the&nbsp; reasons in support thereof, and,&nbsp; hence,&nbsp; it suspended the&nbsp; period to appeal&nbsp; until the determination of said motion.<br><br>Relative to the alleged unprecedented delay in the filing of a&nbsp; satisfactory record on&nbsp; appeal, we agre'C. with the finding&nbsp; of the Court of Appeals to the effect that the delay was&nbsp; due to the acts of&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondents, as well&nbsp; as of the petitioner herein, for both had asked several postponements and extensions of time, filed memoranda and&nbsp; reply&nbsp; memoranda, and raised or provoked a number of&nbsp; other issues or incidents which&nbsp; necessarily delayed the perfection&nbsp; of the appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp; petitioner should not be allowed to profit by said delay, to which he had actively contributed,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </span></sup>Lastly, petitioner&nbsp; maintains that, although the&nbsp; record on appeal&nbsp; had been approved on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 28, 1949,&nbsp; it was&nbsp; not forwarded&nbsp; to the Court of Appeals until December 8, 1949.&nbsp; Section 3 of Rule&nbsp; 48 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>"If the record on appeal&nbsp; is not received by&nbsp; the Court of Appeals within thirty days after the approval&nbsp; thereof, the appellee may, upon notice to the&nbsp; appellant, move the court to grant an order directing the clerk of&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court forthwith to&nbsp; transmit such record on appeal or to declare&nbsp; the same abandoned&nbsp; for failure to prosecute."<br></blockquote>Considering that respondents&nbsp; herein were <i>not notified</i> of the approval of the record on appeal until&nbsp; December 8, 1949, on which date the record&nbsp; on appeal was&nbsp; forwarded to the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals, and that&nbsp; the aforementioned provision of the&nbsp; Rules of Court does impose upon&nbsp; said court the mandatory duty to declare the appeal abandoned for failure to prosecute, we&nbsp; believe&nbsp; that no&nbsp; error&nbsp; was committed in giving due&nbsp; course to the appeal and that the same has been duly perfected.<br><br>(2)&nbsp; Did the Court of&nbsp; Appeals have jurisdiction to try the case, on appeal from the decision of the court of first instance?&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; maintains&nbsp; the&nbsp; negative,&nbsp; upon the ground that the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; involved only questions&nbsp; of&nbsp; law. This is not correct, for the very motion for reconsideration adverted to above, indicated that the appeal raised some issues of fact, such as, for instance, whether or not the will in question was&nbsp; in the possession of respondent&nbsp; Rosario Guevara and whether respondent Quinto had been authorized by her to perfect the appeal on her behalf.&nbsp; At any rate, the case is now before us and, upon examination of the record and consideration of all the issues therein raised, we are of the opinion that, had the appeal been forwarded directly to this Court, we would have disposed of it in the manner set forth in the&nbsp; decision of the Court of Appeals, the review of which is sought by herein appellant.<br><br>(3)&nbsp; The last question&nbsp; for determination in&nbsp; this case is whether or not&nbsp; the petition for probate of&nbsp; the will&nbsp; of Victorino L. Guevara is barred by&nbsp; the statute&nbsp; of limitations, considering that the testator died on September 27, 19S3, and that the petition for probate&nbsp; of&nbsp; said will was filed twelve (12) years later, or, to be exact, on October 5, 1945.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals resolved the question in the negative, upon the following grounds:<br><blockquote>"We&nbsp; are of the opinion that the Court&nbsp; below was in&nbsp; error&nbsp; when it&nbsp; declared that the petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; probate of the will of&nbsp; Victorino Guevara was barred by prescription.&nbsp; The provision of&nbsp; Article 756 of the old Civil&nbsp; Code (1042 of the New) and of Rule 76 of the Rules of Court, reiterating those of the old Code of Civil Procedure (Act 190), point out that the presentation&nbsp; of a decedent's will to the competent court has&nbsp; always been deemed by our law as&nbsp; more of a duty than a right,&nbsp; and the neglect&nbsp; of such obligation carries with it the&nbsp; corresponding penalty;&nbsp; and it is inconsistent with that policy that the court should refuse to admit wills to probate, without inquiry into their validity.&nbsp; The authority given&nbsp; to testators&nbsp; to dispose freely&nbsp; of a portion&nbsp; of their&nbsp; estate&nbsp; would&nbsp; be imperfectly safeguarded, unless adequate measures were provided by the state to assure that the&nbsp; wishes of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deceased&nbsp; would&nbsp; be carried out. Because the&nbsp; decedent&nbsp; may no longer act to have&nbsp; his testamentary dispositions&nbsp; duly executed, the state&nbsp; authority&nbsp; must&nbsp; take over&nbsp; the opposite vigilance and supervision,&nbsp; so that free testamentary disposition does not remain a delusion and a dream.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was expressly recognized by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in its&nbsp; previous decision, G.&nbsp; R. No. 48840 '(Exhibit&nbsp; E) when it said:<br><br>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; we hold that under section 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 74, in&nbsp; relation to Rule 76,&nbsp; if&nbsp; the decedent left a will&nbsp; and no&nbsp; debts 'and the heirs and legatees&nbsp; desire to&nbsp; make an extra-judicial&nbsp; partition of the estate, they must first present that will to&nbsp; the court for probate and divide the estate in accordance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; will.&nbsp; They may&nbsp; not&nbsp; disregard the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; will unless those provisions are contrary&nbsp; to law.&nbsp; Neither may they do away with the presentation of the will to the&nbsp; court for probate,&nbsp; <i>because such suppression&nbsp; of the will&nbsp; is contrary to&nbsp; law&nbsp; and&nbsp; public&nbsp; policy. </i> The&nbsp; law&nbsp; enjoins the&nbsp; probate of the&nbsp; will and <i>public policy&nbsp; requires</i> it, because unless the will&nbsp; is probated and notice thereof given to&nbsp; the&nbsp; whole world, the right&nbsp; of ¦a person to dispose of his property by will may be rendered nugatory, as is&nbsp; attempted&nbsp; to&nbsp; be done&nbsp; in the instant case.&nbsp; Absent legatees and devisees, or&nbsp; such of them as&nbsp; may have no knowledge of the will, could be cheated of their inheritance thru the collusion of some of the&nbsp; heirs who might agree to the&nbsp; partition&nbsp; of the estate among themselves to the exclusion of&nbsp; others.'&nbsp; (Italics&nbsp; supplied)<br><br>"In&nbsp; holding&nbsp; the statute of limitations&nbsp; applicable to the&nbsp; probate of wills,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; below&nbsp; failed , to&nbsp; notice&nbsp; that its doctrine&nbsp; was destructive of the right of testamentary disposition and violative&nbsp; of the owner's&nbsp; right to&nbsp; control&nbsp; his property within&nbsp; the legal&nbsp; limits. The appealed order in fact&nbsp; leaves wills&nbsp; at the mercy&nbsp; and whim of custodians and heirs interested in&nbsp; their suppression.&nbsp; The lower court would&nbsp; in&nbsp; effect abdicate the tutelary power that passed to the Republic from the former sovereigns, that 'potestad suprcma que&nbsp; en ml reside&nbsp; para velar&nbsp; por el&nbsp; puntual cumplimiento de las&nbsp; ultimas ¦voluntaries',&nbsp; asserted as one of the&nbsp; royal&nbsp; prerogatives in&nbsp; the&nbsp; 'Real Cedula'&nbsp; of March 18, 1776.<br><br>"It is not without purpose&nbsp; that Rule&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court 77 prescribes that any 'person interested in&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate&nbsp; may, <i> at&nbsp; any time</i>&nbsp; after the death of the&nbsp; testator, petition the court having&nbsp; jurisdiction to have the will allowed'. Taken from the Code of Procedure of&nbsp; California, this provision has&nbsp; been interpreted as meaning that the statute of limitations has&nbsp; no&nbsp; application to probate of wills.&nbsp; In case of In&nbsp; re&nbsp; Hume's Estate,&nbsp; 179&nbsp; Calif. 338,&nbsp; 176 Pac. 681, th California Supreme Court&nbsp; ruled that:<br><br>'The chapter&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; relating to the probate of wills does not provide for&nbsp; opposition to such&nbsp; probate&nbsp; on the ground of the bar of&nbsp; the&nbsp; statute&nbsp; of&nbsp; limitations, but, in effect, exclude it from the category of grounds allowed&nbsp; as a&nbsp; basis for such opposition. Section 1299 declares that&nbsp; any person&nbsp; interested in&nbsp; the estate 'may at any time after the death of the testator, petition the court having jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; have the will proved. This implies&nbsp; tha is no arbitrary time limit.'<br><br>As&nbsp; additional reasons,&nbsp; the&nbsp; same Court stated:<br><br>*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 1317 declares:&nbsp; 'If the court is sa upon the proof taken, or from&nbsp; the facts&nbsp; found by the jury, that the will was duly executed, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the will testator at of its execution was of sound&nbsp; and disposing mind and not acting under duress,&nbsp; menace,&nbsp; fraud,&nbsp; or undue influence,&nbsp; a certification of the proof and the facts found, signed by the judge&nbsp; and attested by the seal of the court, must be&nbsp; attached to the will.'<br><br>'This excludes the bar of the statute of limitation from consideration as one of&nbsp; the&nbsp; matters which may&nbsp; be shown in opposition to the probate.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is further emphasized by&nbsp; section 1341 which, in substance, declares that,&nbsp; if upon the verdict of the jury facts mentioned in&nbsp; section 1317&nbsp; as aforesaid appear to be established, the court 'must'&nbsp; admit the will to probate.&nbsp; Section 1314 makes it imperative that&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; shall&nbsp; admit the "will to probate if the execution&nbsp; is&nbsp; proven and the&nbsp; grounds&nbsp; of opposition authorized by section&nbsp; 1312&nbsp; are not&nbsp; established.&nbsp; This&nbsp; clearly implies that no grounds of&nbsp; opposition other than those enumerated in section 1312 may be set&nbsp; up,&nbsp; and it leaves no&nbsp; place&nbsp; for the application of&nbsp; the statute&nbsp; of limitations.<br><br>'It is further&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; observed that,&nbsp; notwithstanding the positive and comprehensive language of sections 343 and 369, if taken literally, there can he no doubt that&nbsp; they&nbsp; cannot apply to&nbsp; all special&nbsp; proceedings of&nbsp; a civil nature. Proceedings for a chang name, or in arbitration, or for voluntary dissolution of a corporation, or for guardianship, or for a&nbsp; married woman to become&nbsp; a&nbsp; sole trader, are all&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; definition of&nbsp; the phrase, and&nbsp; each is enumerated, classed, and defined as&nbsp; such proceeding by the Code.&nbsp; If statute of limitations applied, it would begin to run against such proceedings as soon as the right to institute them accrued.&nbsp; Yet from very nature of these&nbsp; proceedings it is obvious that neither of could be subject to such&nbsp; limitation.<br><br>'This construction&nbsp; of these Code&nbsp; provisions is confirmed by&nbsp; the long-continued and uniform practice and the universal understanding of the bench&nbsp; and bar&nbsp; of the state on&nbsp; the subject.'<br><center><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></center><br>'Action to quiet title frequently involve wills of persons who have died many&nbsp; years before the action was begun.&nbsp; The section contemplates that such&nbsp; a will, although not&nbsp; yet&nbsp; probated, may&nbsp; be construed in&nbsp; the&nbsp; action and may be&nbsp; afterwards probated, and it clearly shows that the&nbsp; Legislature did&nbsp; not understand that the right to probate such will&nbsp; would bo barred if the&nbsp; testator had&nbsp; died more than four years before the petition&nbsp; for probate was filed.<br><br>'This uniform&nbsp; practice and understanding of the bench and bar, and of the legislative department of the state&nbsp; also, is a&nbsp; <i>strong argument to the effect that the statute&nbsp; of limitations ddus not apply to&nbsp; such&nbsp; proceedings. The authorities on the effect of such long acquiescence are&nbsp; numerous.</i><br><br>"The Statute of Limitations upon which the court below&nbsp; has relied, sections&nbsp; 38 to 50&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; old&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Civil Procedure, Act 190, undertakes&nbsp; to fix limits for the filing of 'civil actions', but none for 'special proceedings' of which probate is admittedly&nbsp; one.&nbsp; The distinction is&nbsp; not purely verbal,&nbsp; but&nbsp; based on differences that&nbsp; make the limitation to 'actions' inapplicable&nbsp; to&nbsp; 'special&nbsp; proceedings'.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, the&nbsp; Supreme Court of&nbsp; New York has&nbsp; adequately&nbsp; remarked (In re Canfield's Will,&nbsp; 300 NYS 502) :<br><br><i>'A&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; in&nbsp; a private&nbsp; proceeding owes&nbsp; no&nbsp; legal duty&nbsp; or obligation to&nbsp; the proponent&nbsp; as&nbsp; such, wherefore&nbsp; it is impossible&nbsp; for him to&nbsp; violate such&nbsp; non-existent obligation.&nbsp; Furthermore&nbsp; such a proceeding is not instituted for the vindication of any personal right to the proponent.&nbsp; The subject-matter is&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; wholly absent which could give rise&nbsp; to any 'cause of action'&nbsp; against any&nbsp; respondent therein.</i><br><br><i>'The primary purpose of the, proceeding&nbsp; is not, to establish&nbsp; the existence of the right of any living person, but to determine whether or not the decedent has performed the acts specified by the pertinent statutes which are the&nbsp; essential&nbsp; prerequisites to personal direction of the mode of devolution of his property&nbsp; on death.&nbsp; There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no legal but merely&nbsp; a moral duty resting&nbsp; upon a proponent&nbsp; to attempt to ¦validate the wishes&nbsp; of the departed, and he may&nbsp; and frequently does receive no personal benefit from, the&nbsp; performance of&nbsp; the act.</i><br><br>'One of the most fundamental conceptions of probate law, is that it is the duty of the court to effectuate, in so far as may be compatible&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; public interest, the&nbsp; devolutionary wishes&nbsp; of a deceased person (Matter of Watson's Will, 262 N.Y. 284, 294, 186 N.E. 787; Matter of Marriman's&nbsp; Estate, 124 Misc.&nbsp; 320, 325, 208 N.Y.S. 672; Foley,.S. affirmed 217 App. Div. 733,&nbsp; 216 N.Y.S. 842; Matter of Lensman's Estate,&nbsp; 137&nbsp; Misc.&nbsp; 77, 78, 243 N.Y.S. 126, Henderson, S., Matter of Drake's Estate, 160 Misc. 587,&nbsp; 593, 290&nbsp; N.Y.S.&nbsp; 581). To that end, the court is, in effect,&nbsp; an&nbsp; additional party to&nbsp; every litigation affecting the disposal of the assets&nbsp; of the deceased.&nbsp; Matter of Van Valkenburgh's Estate, 164 Misc.&nbsp; 295,&nbsp; 296, 298 N.Y.S. 219. <i>A determination, therefore,&nbsp; that the mere&nbsp; non-action of a person upon ivhmn no legal duty rested&nbsp; in this regard, could have the effect of subverting the wishes of one who&nbsp; was no&nbsp; longer&nbsp; able to protect his own unquestionable&nbsp; rights, would strike at the very foundation of all&nbsp; conceptions of&nbsp; justice&nbsp; as&nbsp; administered&nbsp; in&nbsp; probate courts.'</i><br><br>"These decisions are&nbsp; of high&nbsp; persuasive&nbsp; value (Cu&nbsp; vs. Republic, G. R.&nbsp; L-3018, July 18, 1951); they represent&nbsp; the trend of authority (57 Am. Jur.&nbsp; 535),&nbsp; and enable&nbsp; us&nbsp; to&nbsp; conclude&nbsp; that reason and precedent reject the applicability of&nbsp; the Statute of Limitations to probate proceedings, because these are not exclusively&nbsp; established in the interest of&nbsp; the surviving heirs, but primarily for the protection of the testator's expressed wishes, that are&nbsp; entitled to&nbsp; respect as an effect&nbsp; of his ownership and right&nbsp; of disposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the&nbsp; probate of validly executed wills is required by public&nbsp; policy, as declared by the Supreme Court&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; previous&nbsp; case, G.R.&nbsp; 48840&nbsp; (Exhibit E), the state could&nbsp; not have intended the&nbsp; statute of limitations to&nbsp; defeat that policy.<br><br>"It&nbsp; is true, as ruled by the trial court, that the rights of parties 'should not be&nbsp; left&nbsp; hanging&nbsp; in uncertainty for periods of time far in excess of the maximum period of&nbsp; ten&nbsp; years allowed by law'; but the obvious remedy&nbsp; is&nbsp; for the&nbsp; other interested&nbsp; persons to&nbsp; petition for the production of the will and for its probate, or to inflict upon the guilty&nbsp; party the penalties&nbsp;&nbsp; prescribed&nbsp; by Rule&nbsp; 76 or&nbsp; declare the unworthiness of&nbsp; the heir under&nbsp; the Civil Code for&nbsp; concealing or suppressing the testament; but not to&nbsp; dismiss the petition for probate, however belatedly submitted, and thereby refuse sanction to testamentary dispositions executed with all the formalities prescribed by law, incidentally prejudicing&nbsp; also those testamentary heirs who do not happen to be successors ab inlestato.&nbsp; That in this particular case the appealed rule may not&nbsp; work injustice would not excuse its adoption as a general norm&nbsp; applicable to all cases..<br><br>"It&nbsp; is likewise reasonable to assume that if the Supreme Court had considered&nbsp; the&nbsp; ten-year limitation applicable to probate proceedings, it&nbsp; would not have&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; on December&nbsp; 29, 1943&nbsp; 'to present the document Exhibit A to the proper court for probate in accordance&nbsp; with law', because the ten&nbsp; years from the&nbsp; death&nbsp; of the testator expired in September of that same year, two months&nbsp; before the&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; It is safe to assume that the high Court would not order a&nbsp; useless step.&nbsp; The reasoning that the&nbsp; phrase 'in&nbsp; accordance with law' was&nbsp; a&nbsp; qualification signifying 'if&nbsp; still legally possible*, appears&nbsp; to be far-fetched and unjustified.&nbsp; The plain import of the words employed by the&nbsp; high&nbsp; Court is that the probate should follow the&nbsp; procedure provided for the&nbsp; purpose."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>"The&nbsp; other reasons&nbsp; advanced by the court a&nbsp; quo in&nbsp; support&nbsp; of its order dismissing the petition are also untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The allegation contained&nbsp; in&nbsp; paragraph 10 of the&nbsp; original&nbsp; petition, that 'the will, or its testamentary dispositions, had been <span style="font-style: italic;">de jure</span> revoked in so far as the parcel of&nbsp; 259 hectares described in&nbsp; said&nbsp; will is concerned, does not justify&nbsp; the&nbsp; finding that the&nbsp; probate would be pointless. What is alleged is a partial revocation, only&nbsp; as to the parcel of land affected; but&nbsp; as previously shown,&nbsp; the will disposed of other&nbsp; property besides&nbsp; that&nbsp; one.&nbsp; And&nbsp; even granting&nbsp; that, the&nbsp; next allegation&nbsp; to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that&nbsp; plaintiff sought to&nbsp; probate 'only for&nbsp; the purposes&nbsp; of her&nbsp; acknowledgment as natural&nbsp; child&nbsp; in said will', constitutes&nbsp; an averment&nbsp; that&nbsp; the will had&nbsp; been&nbsp; fully&nbsp; revoked,&nbsp; the same would&nbsp; at the&nbsp; most constitute a&nbsp; conclusion or inference that the lower court was not&nbsp; bound&nbsp; to admit.&nbsp; Because the appellant claimed&nbsp; or believed that the revocation of the will as to&nbsp; the large parcel of land constituted&nbsp; a total revocation of the testament is&nbsp; no reason&nbsp; why the court should concur in&nbsp; the same belief or conclusion,&nbsp; especially when the&nbsp; will itself, appended to the&nbsp; petition, showed that&nbsp; there&nbsp; were other&nbsp; properties&nbsp; and other&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; or&nbsp; legatees, and&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; trial court had before it the decision&nbsp; of the Supreme' Court&nbsp; ordering the filing of the will for&nbsp; its probate because, as stated in its decision, such a step was enjoined by law and public policy.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; the defect, if any, incurred in failing to ask for the probate <i> in&nbsp; toto</i>&nbsp; of&nbsp; the will, was subsequently&nbsp; cured and corrected in the&nbsp; amended petition, where not&nbsp; only the objectionable statements&nbsp; were eliminated,&nbsp; but others added indicating the existence of&nbsp; a partible&nbsp; estate.<br><br>"Assuming that&nbsp; the&nbsp; original petition violated&nbsp; the order of the Supreme Court in&nbsp; so&nbsp; far as it&nbsp; did not&nbsp; ask&nbsp; for the allowance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; entire will, the court below&nbsp; erred in&nbsp; dismissing1 the&nbsp; petition, for&nbsp; it thereby&nbsp; sanctioned&nbsp; further&nbsp; disobedience to the order of the superior court.&nbsp; Once again, it must be repeated&nbsp; that the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of dismissal failed to take into&nbsp; account that the case involved&nbsp; not only the&nbsp; interests&nbsp; of Eosario Guevara,&nbsp; and those of the appellee Ernesto Guevara and the&nbsp; other legatees,&nbsp; but specially the&nbsp; express desires of the testator; and that the&nbsp; protection and&nbsp; defense of the latter developed&nbsp; upon the court&nbsp; itself,&nbsp; since&nbsp; no one else made any&nbsp; move to enforce them.<br><br>"Even if the&nbsp; other heirs had failed to&nbsp; show interest i case (a&nbsp; fact&nbsp; not properly&nbsp; inferable from their&nbsp; non-intervention in the case, because the order of publication of the petition on only called for those interested to&nbsp; 'appear to contest the allowance' and not to support&nbsp; it)&nbsp; (Rec. on App., p. 7), and&nbsp; even if the other&nbsp; heirs had already received their shares, the order refusing the probate&nbsp; remains indefensible.&nbsp; If the other heirs were not&nbsp; interested, there remained the wishes of the testator to&nbsp; be supported and protected if validly expressed.&nbsp; If the heirs had distributed the estate, the distribution was illegal&nbsp; and improper&nbsp; unless&nbsp; the will be first prob The Supreme Court&nbsp; so ruled in its previous&nbsp; decision&nbsp; (G. R. 48840)&nbsp; heretofore quoted.<br><br>'Even&nbsp; if the decedent left no debts and nobody raises any question as tot the authenticity and due execution of the will, none of heirs may sue for the partition of&nbsp; the estate in&nbsp; accordance with that will without first securing its&nbsp; allowance&nbsp; or probate&nbsp; by the court: first, because the law expressly provides that 'no will shall pass either real or&nbsp; personal estate unless it&nbsp; is proved and allowed in the&nbsp; proper court; and, second, because&nbsp; the probate of a will, which is a proceeding in rem,&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; dispensed with and substituted by&nbsp; any other proceeding, judicial or extrajudicial, with offending against&nbsp; public&nbsp; policy&nbsp; designed to effectuate the testator's right to dispose of his property by will in accordance with law and to protect the&nbsp; rights of the heirs and legatees under the will thru the means provided by law,&nbsp; among which are the publication and the personal notices to each and&nbsp; all of said&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; and&nbsp; legatees. Nor may the court approve and allow the will presented in evidence in such an action for&nbsp; partition, which is&nbsp; one in personam, any&nbsp; more than it could decree the registration under&nbsp; the Torrens system of the land involved in an&nbsp; ordinary action for <i>revindicacion</i> or partition.'<br><br>"From whatever angle the case is viewed, a hearing on the allowance of the will is unavoidable.&nbsp; The persistent,&nbsp; albeit obnoxious, attempts of Rosario Guevara to sidetrack the will are not remedied by dismissing the petition for probate of&nbsp; will, and allowing Ernesto to&nbsp; retain a greater interest than that intended by&nbsp; the testator."
