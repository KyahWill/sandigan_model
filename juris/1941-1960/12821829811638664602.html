				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Leyte, 
convicting Fructuoso Rabandaban of parricide.
<p>The evidence shows that appellant and the now deceased Florida Hapala were 
husband and wife living together in a house in one of the barrios of the 
municipality of Abuyog, Leyte. Coming home one night from his camote plantation, 
appellant found his wife lying in bed with another man. The man was able to 
escape through the window, but the wife received a severe scolding from her 
husband and was ordered to leave the house. Calling her husband names, the wife 
gathered her clothes and picked up a bolo in the kitchen, and when her husband 
followed her there, she attacked him with the bolo, wounding him twice in the 
abdomen. Wresting the bolo from his wife, appellant stabbed her with it in the 
breast. She died from her wound that same night. But appellant, though seriously 
wounded, survived and is now being made to answer for the killing of his 
wife.</p>
<p>We are with the trial court in not giving appellant the benefit of Article 
247 of the Revised Penal Code, it appearing that although he found his wife in 
bed with another man, he did not kill her on that account. For her reprehensible 
conduct he merely unbraided her and bade her leave the house.</p>
<p>But we think that the trial court erred in not finding that appellant had 
acted in self-defense. The evidence shows unlawful serious aggression on the 
part of the victim without sufficient provocation, and it also seems apparent 
that there was reasonable necessity for the means employed to repel the assault. 
But speculating that appellant could have perhaps saved himself by throwing away 
the bolo after wresting it from his wife, the trial court opined that there was 
no need for him to stab her once she was disarmed. To this we cannot agree. When 
appellant got possession of the bolo he already must have been in a precarious 
condition because of his wounds, one of which was described by the sanitary 
inspector as"fatal" since the large intestine came out of it. And appellant, we 
think, was justified in believing that his wife wanted to finish him off 
because, according to the evidence, she struggled to regain possession of the 
bolo after he had succeeded in wresting it from her. With the aggressor still 
unsubdued and showing determination to fight to the finish, it would have been 
folly on the part of appellant, who must already have been losing strength due 
to loss of blood, to throw away the bolo and thus give his adversary a chance to 
pick it up and again use it against himÂ« Having the right to protect his life, 
appellant was not in duty bound to expose himself to such a contingency.</p>
<p>The case for the present appellant is not unlike that of the accused in U. 3. 
vs. Molina, 19 Phil. 277, 231, 232, where this Court made the following 
pronouncement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * It was clearly shown by the testimony of the accused, corroborated by 
the witness Elseco, that after the commencement of the assault by the deceased, 
the struggle between the latter and the accused did not cease for one moment, 
now each combatant trying to wrest the bolo away from the other, now the 
deceased endeavoring to arm himself with the hatchet which undoubtedly was 
within his reach, until finally the deceased himself was disabled and could no 
longer continue to struggle in consequence of the wounds which he received 
during the affray. Considering the decidedly aggressive attitude of the deceased 
from the commencement of this struggle until its termination, it can not be said 
that there was a cessation of the danger for the accused, even for a single 
instant. If, through the various incidents of the struggle, or any favorable 
accident whatever, the deceased had succeeded in recovering the bolo or in 
possessing himself of the hatchet, as he attempted to do to the last, the result 
of the combat would probably have been very different; perhaps the accused, 
instead of being the slayer, would himself have been killed. The accused 
certainly was not in duty Bound to expose himself to such a contingency, and 
while the struggle continued, and, consequently, the danger to his person or to 
his life subsisted he had a perfect and indisputable right to repel such danger 
by wounding his adversary, if necessary, as from the circumstances of the case 
it was, without any doubt whatever, and even to disable him completely so that 
he could not continue the assault. In our opinion, the means employed by the 
accused were rationally necessary to repel the assault, and as the latter was in 
all respects unlawful and was not preceded by any provocation of any kind on the 
part of the accused himself, we declare the said accused to be exempt from 
criminal liability, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of article 
8 of the Penal Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, we think that the appellant should have been 
declared exempt from criminal liability on the ground of self-defense. The 
judgment appealed from is, therefore, reversed and appellant acquitted with 
costs <em>de oficio</em>.</p><em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, 
Tuason, Montemayor</em>, and <em>Torres, JJ.</em>, concur. <br><i>Paras </i>and<i> </i>Feria, <i>JJ.</i>, no part.<br><br>
