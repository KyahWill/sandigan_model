				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> In&nbsp; Civil Case&nbsp; No. 3269 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of Occidental Negros,&nbsp; entitled&nbsp; "Jesus&nbsp; Quiatchon,&nbsp; Jose T. Real,&nbsp; Manuel Cabiles&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; Alfredo T. Schwab,&nbsp; petitioners, vs. Manuel Villanueva, in his&nbsp; capacity as&nbsp; Acting Mayor of the City of Bacolod, respondent/' which was an action for mandamus to&nbsp; compel the defendant&nbsp; to reinstate the plaintiffs as policemen of said city and to pay&nbsp; them their salaries during the&nbsp; period of their&nbsp; ouster in&nbsp; additon to moral and exemplary damages,&nbsp; the said court&nbsp; under date of September 23, 1955 rendered a&nbsp; decision&nbsp; the dispositive part&nbsp; of which reads;<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the writ&nbsp; of mandamus prayed for is hereby granted and judgment is rendered&nbsp; ordering the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Acting&nbsp; City Mayor of Bacolod&nbsp; City, to&nbsp; forthwith reinstate the petitioners in their former&nbsp; positions,&nbsp; declaring the petitioners with&nbsp; the right to collect&nbsp; their&nbsp; salaries corresponding&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; period from the day they were&nbsp; illegally ousted from their,&nbsp; positions,&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; time when&nbsp; they&nbsp; shall be actually reinstated, further&nbsp; ordering the respondent to pay the petitioners&nbsp; out&nbsp; of&nbsp; his personal funds and by way of moral damages the amount of P5,000 to each of the&nbsp; petitioners, and&nbsp; by&nbsp; way of exemplary&nbsp; damages, the further sum of P2,500&nbsp; also&nbsp; to each of the petitioners. The costs&nbsp; of these proceedings, shall be taxed against the respondent."</blockquote> That&nbsp; case is now&nbsp; in this Court on appeal taken by the defendant&nbsp; jointly with the City of&nbsp; Bacolod.&nbsp;&nbsp; But before the appeal was perfected, the court, at the instance of the petitioners and over the&nbsp; objection of the defendant, issued sxi&nbsp; order for the&nbsp; immediate execution of the judgment, the dispositive part&nbsp; of the order reading as follows: <br><blockquote>"Wherefore,&nbsp; finding the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the petitioners&nbsp; well taken, the Clerk of Court is&nbsp; "hereby ordered&nbsp; to issue the&nbsp; corresponding order of execution of the decision rendered in the above entitled case insofar as&nbsp; it orders the reinstatement&nbsp; of the petitioners in their respective positions by the respondent Acting Mayor,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; payment of their back salaries from the time of their removal until they shall be actually reinstated by the official in&nbsp; charge of making said payment.&nbsp; The execution shall be directed to the Acting City Mayor of the City of&nbsp; Bacolod insofar as&nbsp; the&nbsp; reinstatement&nbsp; is concerned and to the&nbsp; Treasurer of said City with&nbsp; regards to the payment of their back salaries.&nbsp; Compliance with the order of execution should be as prescribed under Section 9, Rule 39 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court." </blockquote>Reconsideration of the order having been denied, the City of Bacolod, in conjunction with the defendant, filed in this Court&nbsp; the&nbsp; present petition for certiorari to enjoin the respondent&nbsp; Judge from compelling the&nbsp; petitioner Manuel Villanueva&nbsp; to reinstate the respondents policemen&nbsp; and to annul&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; order of&nbsp; immediate execution insofar&nbsp; as it would authorize a levy on the properties of the&nbsp; city to satisfy the judgment for the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the policemen's salaries during&nbsp; the&nbsp; period of their ouster.<br><br>Answering the&nbsp; petition, the&nbsp; respondents&nbsp; set up the defense that the issuance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; order complained&nbsp; of is authorized by section 2 of Rule 39 and that, as provided in that same section, petitioner's remedy is to file a bond to stay execution.<br><br>Upon the filing of the present&nbsp; petition, this Court,&nbsp; as prayed for therein, issued a writ of preliminary injunction, without bond,&nbsp; to restrain&nbsp; the&nbsp; enforcement of the order complained of.&nbsp; After&nbsp; going over the case, we now come to the conclusion that the petition should be granted and&nbsp; the preliminary injunction&nbsp; made permanent.<br><br>It is true that section 2&nbsp; of Rule&nbsp; 39 allows execution to issue pending appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; But such execution can only&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; against&nbsp; one who is a party to the&nbsp; action and not against one who,&nbsp; not being a, party in the case, has not yet had his day in court&nbsp; (Tayson and Angeles vs. Ycasiano,&nbsp; et&nbsp; al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup> G.&nbsp; R. L-2283, May 31, 1949;&nbsp; Manza vs. Santiago, etc.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup> G. R. L-7830, April 30, 1955; Angara vs. Gorospe, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">3</sup>&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; L-9230,&nbsp; April&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1957).&nbsp; The record shows that the city of Bacolod was not made&nbsp; a party&nbsp; to the case&nbsp; of mandamus filed against its&nbsp; acting mayor. True, the order&nbsp; of execution is specifically directed to&nbsp; the&nbsp; acting mayor&nbsp; and the city treasurer, and not to the&nbsp; city itself, but&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no denying that the said order means to&nbsp; have the back salaries of the respondents policemen paid from city&nbsp; funds, so that in the last analysis, it is the city that is being&nbsp; made to satisfy that part of the judgment in the case. <br><br>It should&nbsp; also be noted that, in authorizing execution before appeal, the said section 2 of Rule 39 requires that such execution be allowed only "upon&nbsp; good reasons to be stated in&nbsp; the special&nbsp; order."&nbsp; This&nbsp; requirement&nbsp; is&nbsp; important&nbsp; and&nbsp; must&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; overlooked&nbsp;&nbsp; for,&nbsp; as&nbsp; Chief Justice Moran says, "if the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; is executed and, on appeal, the&nbsp; same is reversed, although there are provisions for restitution, oftentimes damages may arise which cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; fully&nbsp; compensated.&nbsp; Accordingly,&nbsp; execution should be granted only when these considerations are clearly outweighed by superior circumstances demanding urgency, and the above provision requires&nbsp; a&nbsp; statement&nbsp; of those circumstances as a security for their existence."&nbsp; (1 Moran on the Rules of Court, 1952 ed., p.&nbsp; 794, citing Aguilos vs. Barrios, et al., 72 Phil.&nbsp; 285.) The respondent Judge states&nbsp; in his order as a justification for allowing execution that the appeal in this case&nbsp; is untenable&nbsp; and, inferentially, that it is resorted to only for purposes&nbsp; of delay.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is prejudging the appeal now before us, and the&nbsp; assertion that it is&nbsp; intended merely as a&nbsp; means&nbsp; of delay appears to be deduced only from the belief that the appeal is untenable.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then&nbsp; there&nbsp; is' the consideration&nbsp; that the reinstatement of the respondent policemen&nbsp; pending resolution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; taken against the judgment in&nbsp; their favor means the ouster of those now occupying their positions before their right to continue holding the same has been&nbsp; finally&nbsp; determined in the appeal&nbsp; that is&nbsp; now before this Court.&nbsp; Lastly, if the respondent policemen are now&nbsp; reinstated and paid&nbsp; their back&nbsp; salaries from city funds&nbsp; and then the appeal in the main case is&nbsp; decided&nbsp; against&nbsp; them,&nbsp; the&nbsp; city stands to&nbsp; suffer irreparable injury because if&nbsp;&nbsp; it is hardly to be expected&nbsp; that the said&nbsp; policemen&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be able to make restitution.<br><br>While the&nbsp; issuance of immediate execution under, section 2 of Rule 39 is discretionary with the trial court, we are persuaded&nbsp; that in&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case&nbsp; that&nbsp; discretion has not been properly exercised, for which&nbsp; reason the petition for certiorari&nbsp; must be,&nbsp; as&nbsp; it is hereby,&nbsp; granted, the order complained of annulled and the writ of preliminary injunction already issued made permanent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without costs. <br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J.
