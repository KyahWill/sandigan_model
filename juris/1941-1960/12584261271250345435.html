				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 28, 1955, Ernesto A. Bernabe, special counsel of Pasay City, accused Lydia Padilla of a violation of Article 364 of the Revised Penal Code before the Municipal Court in an information which reads as follows;<br><blockquote>"That on or about or during the period of February 2 and 3, 1955, in Pasay City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused Lydia Padilla, with the principal purpose of blemishing the honor and reputation of one Fausta Bravo, a married woman, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously utter, circulate and spread gossips, rumors,&nbsp; or stories highly offensive and defamatory to her honor, virtue and reputation, by then and there telling some people in the neighborhood that said Fausta Bravo was a paramour of one Sangalang, a man not her husband,"<br></blockquote>The accused filed a motion to quash on the grounds (1) that the special counsel has no authority to file the information; and (2) that more than one offense is charged therein, This motion was opposed by the special counsel.&nbsp; On. April 25, 1955, the court-issued an order dismissing the information for the reason that the case was not initiated by a complaint filed by the offended party pursuant to paragraph 4, article 360 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; On appeal to the Court of First Instance, the latter sustained the order, whereupon the special counsel took the present appeal.)<br><br>While the information filed by the special counsel of Pasay City states that the accused is,'.charged with a violation of Article 364 of the Revised Penal Code, however, the information avers facts which constitute a different offense.&nbsp; In other words, while said Article 364 penalizes any intrigue which has for its purpose to blemish the honor or reputation of a person, the in formation avers facts which do not merely constitute an incriminatory machination or a defamatory intrigue but go as far as accusing a married woman of having illicit relations with a man not her husband which in effect constitutes the crime of adultery, Thus,&nbsp; the&nbsp; information alleges that "with the principal purpose&nbsp; of blemishing the honor and reputation of one Fausta Bravo, a married woman, (the accused did ) circulate and spread gossips, rumors or stories highly offensive&nbsp; and defamatory to her honor, virtue and reputation,<span style="font-style: italic;"> by&nbsp; then and there telling some people in the neighbor hood that said Fausta Bravo was a paramour of one Sangalang,</span> a man not her husband," (Underlining supplied)&nbsp; The import of this allegation cannot be mistaken.&nbsp; It charges&nbsp; Fausta Bravo with committing adultery pure and simple.<br><br>Considering that under article 360, paragraph 4, of the Revised Penal Code, no criminal action for defamation which consists in the imputation of a&nbsp; crime which cannot be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> can be brought except upon the complaint filed by the offended party, and the crime of adultery is one that cannot be prosecuted&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> de oficio</span> (Article 344, <span style="font-style: italic;">Idem</span>.) , it is obvious that the information filed in this case is insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court of origin.&nbsp; The trial court was therefore correct in quashing the information.<br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is&nbsp; affirmed,<br><br>without pronouncement as to costs. <br><br><i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
