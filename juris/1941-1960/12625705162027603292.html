				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the&nbsp; general elections held&nbsp; on&nbsp; November&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1955, Mariano B. Delgado, Angel B. Tiu and Alfredo Laure were candidates for the office of Mayor&nbsp; of Barugo, Leyte.&nbsp; The municipal board&nbsp; of&nbsp; canvassers certified that Delgado obtained 1,429 votes, Tiu 1,428 votes&nbsp; and&nbsp; Laure&nbsp; 1,400 votes, and accordingly,&nbsp; it proclaimed Delgado as mayor-elect with a plurality of&nbsp; 1&nbsp; vote over Tiu&nbsp; and 29&nbsp; votes over Laure.<br><br>Dissatisfied with&nbsp; this&nbsp; result, Tiu filed a protest before the Court of First Instance of Leyte&nbsp; against Delgado and Laure alleging the commission of fraud and irregularities in&nbsp; Precincts Nos, 2, 4-A,&nbsp; 7, 8, 25 and 27.&nbsp; In&nbsp; due time, Delgado&nbsp; filed&nbsp; his answer&nbsp; and a&nbsp; counter-protest&nbsp; wherein he&nbsp; challenged the election in Precincts&nbsp; Nos. 11, 13, 19, 20 and 26.&nbsp; Laure&nbsp; also filed his answer and counter-protest impugning the election in Precincts Nos. 7, 12, 15 and 27.<br><br>During the pendency of the case,&nbsp; Delgado withdrew his counter-protest in Precincts&nbsp; Nos. 13, 19 and 26 with the result that only 10 precincts became the subject of trial, namely, Precincts Nos. 2, 4-A, 7, 8, 11,&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 20, 25 and 27.&nbsp;&nbsp; On April&nbsp; 25, 1956,&nbsp; after&nbsp; due trial,&nbsp; the court rendered its decision proclaiming Angel B. Tiu as the Mayor duly elected&nbsp; with a margin&nbsp; of&nbsp; 3 votes over Mariano&nbsp; B. Delgado and 29&nbsp; votes over&nbsp; Alfredo Laure.&nbsp; Delgado appealed the decision to the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals which&nbsp; on September 24, 1957 rendered a decision declaring that the election for the Mayor of Barugo, Leyte was a tie between Delgado and Tiu&nbsp; and so&nbsp; it&nbsp; ordered that the&nbsp; case be remanded to the&nbsp; lower court in order that the&nbsp; tie may&nbsp; be decided by lot as authorized by law.&nbsp; Delgado ultimately filed the present&nbsp; petition for review wherein he assigned several&nbsp; errors involving 15 ballots.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiu on his part made a counter-assignment of errors covering 17 ballots.<br><br>We will first take up the assignments of error of appellant.<br><br>The first assignment&nbsp; of error refers to two (2) ballots (Exh. "A",&nbsp; Precinct No. 20, and Exh. "Q", Precinct No. 25), which were rejected by&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Court of Appeals on the ground that "M&nbsp; Delgado", name of petitioner, was written on the line for&nbsp; Vice-Mayor,&nbsp; invoking the doctrine laid down in the cases of Avidado <i>vs.</i>.&nbsp; Talens&nbsp; (52 Phil., 661) and Villaviray <i>vs.</i>. Alvarez&nbsp; (61 Phil., 42, 45) to the effect that "in order that a&nbsp; vote may be counted in favor of the candidate for a particular office,&nbsp; his name must be written in the&nbsp; space reserved on&nbsp; the ballot for the name of the candidate for that office."<br><br>Petitioner claims that his&nbsp; name was written below the line for Mayor, which is blank, followed by the name "M. Cafieda", a candidate for Vice-Mayor, written below the line reserved for said office, which in turn was followed by the name of a candidate for Councilor, written&nbsp; on the first line&nbsp; for said office.&nbsp; He&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; considering the nature of the ballot,&nbsp; the&nbsp; intention of the voters to&nbsp; vote for him for the office of Mayor can be clearly ascertained. To bolster his contention, he cites the cases of Hilao <i>vs.</i>. Bernados (G. R. No. L-7704, Dec 14, 1954); Mandac <i>vs.</i>. Samonte (54 Phil., 709); Coscolluela <i>vs.</i>. Gaston (63 Phil., 41; 69), and Villavert <i>vs.</i>. Fornier (84 Phil., 756; 47 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. 1789).<br><br>An examination of the ballots in question, however, shows that the name "M. Delgado" was written exactly on the line for Vice-Mayor, which&nbsp; is a clear case of a stray&nbsp; vote under Rules 3 and 13, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code, which provide that any vote in favor of a candidate for an office for which he did not present himself shall be&nbsp; void&nbsp; and counted&nbsp; as a&nbsp; stray&nbsp; vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cases cited by&nbsp; petitioner are inapplicable to the instant case, because said cases&nbsp; refer to votes written&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">immediately below</span> or a little&nbsp; above the&nbsp; line for the office&nbsp; under&nbsp; consideration, where the&nbsp; intention of the voter&nbsp; to vote for a candidate for said office can be&nbsp; ascertained in an indubitable manner, and not&nbsp; where a&nbsp; candidate&nbsp; for an office&nbsp; was voted clearly for&nbsp; another office.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also&nbsp; be inferred from the arguments of the&nbsp; petitioner that the voters who&nbsp; cast these two&nbsp; ballots may have merely committed a general misplacement of the votes intended for Mayor, Vice-Mayor and Councilor.&nbsp; But this Court had already occasion to rule on ballots of similar nature&nbsp; in the case of Amurao <i>vs.</i>.&nbsp; Calangi&nbsp; (104 Phil., 347), wherein it held that such&nbsp; misplaced votes are considered "stray and invalid for having been cast in violation of the provisions of Sections 135 and 149 (13) of the Revised Election Code."&nbsp;&nbsp; For the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appeals did not err in rejecting the two ballot subject of this assignment of error.<br><br>The second&nbsp; assignment of error refers to only one&nbsp; (1) ballot&nbsp; (Exh. "2", Precinct&nbsp; No. 11), which&nbsp; was admitted for respondent Angel&nbsp; B. Tiu under Rule 17, Section 149 of the Revised&nbsp; Election Code.&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; contends&nbsp; that the "two short parallel lines" in the spaces on&nbsp; which the voter did not vote show the intention of the&nbsp; voter to mark his ballot&nbsp; with such lines.&nbsp; The&nbsp; contention&nbsp; is untenable. We agree with the Court of Appeals that such lines merely indicate the voter's&nbsp; desistance from voting which shall not invalidate the ballot&nbsp; as provided for in the aforecited rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ballot was properly admitted&nbsp; for respondent Tiu.<br><br>The third assignment&nbsp; of&nbsp; errors covers&nbsp; one&nbsp; (1) ballot (Exh, "3", Precinct No.&nbsp; 11), which&nbsp; was admitted by the respondent court for Angel Tiu.&nbsp; Petitioner contends that this ballot should be rejected as marked because the name "Proceso Cardines", who&nbsp; was not&nbsp; a candidate, was written thereon three timesâ€”on line 2 for Senators,&nbsp; on line 2 for Members of the Provincial Board and on line 2 for Councilors.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals invoked Rule 13, Section&nbsp; 149 of the Revised Election Code in admitting this ballot, which provides that a vote&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; a non-candidate shall be void and counted as a stray vote but shall not invalidate the whole ballot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :<br><br>We disagree with the conclusion reached by the respondent court.&nbsp; We believe that&nbsp; Rule 13, Section 149 of&nbsp; the Revised Election&nbsp; Code contemplates &amp; vote for&nbsp; a non-candidate which was&nbsp; innocently&nbsp; placed&nbsp; by the voter in the belief&nbsp; that&nbsp; said&nbsp; person&nbsp; was&nbsp; a candidate.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that this voter wrote&nbsp; the name "Proceso Cardines", who was not a candidate, three times on three spaces provided for different offices, reveals that the writing of this name was intentional and serves no other purpose than to identify the ballot.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cases of Gutierrez <i>vs.</i>. Aquino (G.R. No. L-14252 and Gutierrez <i>vs.</i>. Reyes&nbsp; (G. R. No. L-13137), both decided&nbsp; by this Court on&nbsp; February 28,&nbsp; 1959,&nbsp; we held that&nbsp; the name of a candidate for an office written several times&nbsp; on the same ballot shows the clear intention of the voter to&nbsp; identify the&nbsp; ballot.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the present case, the name of a non-candidate&nbsp; was written three times which&nbsp; indicates that&nbsp; the&nbsp; intention to mark the&nbsp; ballot is more&nbsp; evident.&nbsp; This ballot should, therefore, be rejected as marked.<br><br>The fourth assignment of&nbsp; error involves one&nbsp; (1) ballot (Exh. "5", Precinct No. 25), which was admitted by the Court of Appeals&nbsp; as a valid vote for respondent&nbsp; Tiu. Petitioner claims that it is an error to admit this ballot because&nbsp; it contains only the initials "A.B.T.U" on&nbsp; the line for Mayor, invoking Rule 15, Section&nbsp; 149 of the&nbsp; Revised Election&nbsp; Code.<br><br>The respondent court admitted this ballot under Rule 2, Section 149&nbsp; of the Revised Election Code&nbsp; stating&nbsp; that "A.BT. U" is <span style="font-style: italic;">idem&nbsp; sonans</span> with A. B Tiu&nbsp; (Angel B. Tiu). In the case of Gutierrez <span style="font-style: italic;">v</span>. Reyes, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, this Court ruled that the&nbsp; letters "ABCD" which corresponded to the name of candidate Abcede could be read for him under the rule of <span style="font-style: italic;">idem sonans</span>.&nbsp; Following this ruling, and considering&nbsp; the fact that the voter&nbsp; is not well versed in writing, we agree with the Court&nbsp; of Appeals that&nbsp; this ballot should&nbsp; be counted in favor of Angel B. Tiu.<br><br>The fifth assignment of&nbsp; error&nbsp; refers to&nbsp; six&nbsp; (6) ballots (Exh. "3", Precinct&nbsp; No. 8;&nbsp; Exh, "5", Precinct No.&nbsp; 11; Exh. "3", Precinct No.&nbsp; 20;&nbsp; Exhs. "13",&nbsp; "14" and "16", Precinct&nbsp; No. 27), which were admitted by the Court of Appeals in favor of respondent Angel B. Tiu.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner contends that the words written&nbsp; on the line for Mayor do not sufficiently&nbsp; identify the candidate voted for.<br><br>The contention is not well taken because&nbsp; after examining the ballots in question, we find that the name "Atiu"; "A.&nbsp; Ten" or "A. Teu"; "A. teo"; "A. Tu"; "A Teur"&nbsp; and "A teo",&nbsp; which appear written on the line for Mayor, can be read as Tiu,&nbsp; and&nbsp; so they can be admitted for respondent under the rule of <i>idem sonans</i> (Rule 2, Section 149, Revised I Election&nbsp; Code).<br><br>The sixth assignment of error covers two (2) ballots which were both admitted in favor of respondent Tiu. <span style="font-style: italic;">Exh. "1", Precinct No. 25</span>. Petitioner claims that&nbsp; this ballot should be rejected as marked&nbsp; considering the word "Ariba" written after the&nbsp; name&nbsp; "A. Ponferrada" on&nbsp; the 6th line for councilors.&nbsp; This contention is&nbsp; not well founded, because the word "Ariba" can be considered merely as an "appellation of affection and friendship" under Rule 9, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code.<br><br>Exh. "9", Precinct No. 27.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; is also contended&nbsp; that this ballot is marked because&nbsp; the&nbsp; impertinent expression "good for all" appears&nbsp; written&nbsp; on the upper portion&nbsp; of the ballot.&nbsp; This contention is&nbsp; meritorious, because of the ruling: that&nbsp; the&nbsp; writing of impertinent, irrelevant&nbsp; and unnecessary words or expressions invalidates the ballot for it serves&nbsp; no other purpose&nbsp; than to mark or identify the voter&nbsp; (Valenzuela <i>vs.</i>. Carlos, 42&nbsp; Phil., 428;&nbsp; Cecilio <i>vs.</i>. Tomacruz, 62 Phil., 689; Caraecle <i>vs.</i>. CA and Del Castillo, 94 Phil., 308; 50 Off. Gaz., 571).<br><br>The seventh assignment of errors refers to two (2)&nbsp; ballots (Exh.&nbsp; "F"&nbsp; and "G", Precinct No. 27), which were admitted&nbsp; as valid votes for respondent.&nbsp; Petitioner&nbsp; contends that&nbsp; it is&nbsp; an error to&nbsp; consider these&nbsp; two&nbsp; ballots because the same were&nbsp; already classified by the board of inspectors&nbsp; as "marked&nbsp; ballots",&nbsp; the marks consisting&nbsp; of the name "T. Cardines",&nbsp; a non-candidate, written on&nbsp; line 2 for Senators on ballot Exh. "F" and the name "Egnacio", also a non-candidate, written&nbsp; on the 6th line for Councilors on ballot Exh. "G".<br><br>The contention&nbsp; is&nbsp; without merit, because&nbsp; by express provision of the law,&nbsp; the courts may examine&nbsp; or consider all the ballots involved&nbsp; in a contested&nbsp; election regardless of the opinion of the inspectors of election&nbsp; (Sections 175 and 176, of the Revised&nbsp; Election Code; Reforma <i>vs.</i>. De Luna,* G. R. No. L-13242, July 31, 1958).&nbsp; The decision of these inspectors is not binding upon the courts but&nbsp; it&nbsp; is subject to&nbsp; review in case of protest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The alleged&nbsp; marks in these&nbsp; two ballots are&nbsp; not sufficient&nbsp; to&nbsp; invalidate them under Rule 13, Section 149 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Election Code, which&nbsp; provides that the vote in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; non-candidate shall be void and counted as stray vote but shall not invalidate the whole ballot.&nbsp; We&nbsp; therefore, affirm the ruling of the Court of Appeals that these ballots&nbsp; are valid for respondent who was voted thereon for the office of Mayor.<br><br>We shall now consider the counter-assignments&nbsp; of error of respondent.<br><br>The first counter-assignment of error refers to&nbsp; one (1) ballot&nbsp; (Exh. "B", Precinct No.&nbsp; 4-A), which&nbsp; was admitted by respondent&nbsp; court in favor of petitioner. Respondent claims that it was error to count this ballot&nbsp; for petitioner because the name "Romualdez" was written on&nbsp; the&nbsp; line for Mayor and&nbsp; "Delgado" written below said line.<br><br>An examination of this ballot shows that the second line for Members of the Provincial Board is blank,&nbsp; and the name "Romualdez", a candidate for Member of the Provincial Board,&nbsp; was written&nbsp; on the line for Mayor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately below said line for Mayor, "Delgado" was written, followed by the name "Caneda", candidate for ViceMayor, written&nbsp; immediately below the line for Vice-Mayor. The Court of Appeals noted that perhaps the voter made a mistake in writing the name "Romualdez" on&nbsp; the&nbsp; line for Mayor and discovered later his mistake, he&nbsp; inserted therein the&nbsp; name&nbsp; "Delgado", whom he intended&nbsp; to vote for Mayor, and so the ballot was counted for him under the rulings&nbsp; in&nbsp; Mandac <i>vs.</i>. Samonte, supra, Villavert <i>vs.</i>. Fornier,&nbsp; supra, and Hilao <i>vs.</i>. Bernados,&nbsp; supra.<br><br>We agree with the conclusion because the intention of the voter can&nbsp; be&nbsp; ascertained&nbsp; in an indubitable&nbsp; manner. Although it appears that Romualdez and Delgado were voted for the office of Mayor, the misplaced vote&nbsp; for Romualdez, who was a candidate for Board Member,&nbsp; shall be considered merely as a stray vote&nbsp; (Rules 3 and&nbsp; 13, Section 149, Revised Election Code).&nbsp; In the case of Gutierrez <i>vs.</i>. Aquino, supra, this Court ruled that where the names of the candidate for Mayor and the candidate for Vice-Mayor are written on the line for Mayor,&nbsp; the vote for the candidate for Vice-Mayor shall be considered as a stray vote and the vote for the candidate for Mayor as&nbsp; valid.<br><br>Following this ruling, this ballot was&nbsp; correctly admitted for petitioner.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second counter-assignment of error relates to two (2) ballots (Exhs. "F" and "G", Precinct No. 4-A),which were admitted as valid votes for petitioner.&nbsp; Respondent contends that these two ballots were written by one&nbsp; and the same person.<br><br>We disagree, because after examining these ballots we find that the same were not written by one. person.&nbsp; They were therefore properly admitted for petitioner.<br><br>The third counter-assignment of error involves fourteen (14)&nbsp; ballots&nbsp; which were likewise admitted by respondent court in favor of petitioner.<br><br><i>Thirteen (13)&nbsp; ballots (Exhs. "A", "B", "D", "E", "F", "G",&nbsp; "H", "I", "J", "K",&nbsp; "L",&nbsp; "AT, and "N", Precinct No. 25).</i>&nbsp; Respondent contends that these 13 ballots should be rejected as marked, the&nbsp; mark on the first four ballots consisting of&nbsp; writing the name "Cesario" or "Cesar" on the first line for Senators accompanying the name "Sabido", a senatorial candidate; and the mark in the remaining 9 ballots (Exhs. "F" to "N") consisting of the name "Gregorio" written uniformly&nbsp; on the 8th space for Senators, except Exh. "N" where the name "Dregorio" was placed on the first line for Senators after the name "Sabido".<br><br>The Court&nbsp; of Appeals observed that&nbsp; the appearance of the names&nbsp; of persons who are&nbsp; not candidates (Cesar and Gregorio)&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ballots in question "is really suspicious", but invoking&nbsp; Rule 13, Section 149 of the Revised Election Code, which provides that a vote in favor of a non-candidate shall be counted as a stray vote, but shall not invalidate the whole ballot,&nbsp; it admitted them in favor of petitioner.<br><br>We agree with&nbsp; the observation&nbsp; of respondent court that the appearance of the names "Cesar" and "Gregorio" on several ballots on precisely&nbsp; the same space of the ballots is&nbsp; suspicious, but we do not agree to the applicability of Rule 13, Section 149, supra, to said ballots.&nbsp; As we have stated above&nbsp; (see third assignment of error),&nbsp; said rule for the&nbsp; appreciation&nbsp; of ballots contemplates&nbsp; the writing of a name of a non-candidate innocently and not where such name or names are used as a means to&nbsp; identify the ballots.<br><br>This is the situation here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examining&nbsp; the ballots, we find that voters who had difficulty in writing exerted themselves in placing&nbsp; the name "Gregorio" on their ballots, such that the name "Gregorio" was misspelled "Dregorio" (Exh. "N"); where not a single senatorial candidate was voted for and&nbsp; yet the name&nbsp; "Gregorio"&nbsp; was written&nbsp; on the 8th line&nbsp; (Exh.&nbsp;&nbsp; "K");&nbsp; where senatorial&nbsp; candidate "Warns" was voted on the&nbsp; 8th line and yet the voter still wrote therein the name "Gregorio" (Exh. "G").&nbsp; This&nbsp; is indeed a case where&nbsp; the ballots conclusively show that a name of a non-candidate was used as a means to mark them.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; conclusion&nbsp; is strengthened by the fact that all these 13 ballots&nbsp; in question were cast in&nbsp; only one precinct.&nbsp; In the case of Ferrer <i>vs.</i>. De Alban (101&nbsp; Phil., 1018), we&nbsp; held:<br><blockquote>"Ballots Exhibits&nbsp; Y,&nbsp; Y-l, Y-2 and&nbsp; Y-3.&nbsp; These ballots were rejected&nbsp; as marked because there&nbsp; appears written the capital letter "A" on the first&nbsp; space for councilors in each of them.&nbsp; The Court of&nbsp; Appeals ruled that the use of that letter&nbsp; by several electors could not be innocent but must have been&nbsp; in pursuant of a previous agreement to identify these&nbsp; ballots. We have examined these ballots and have reached the same conclusion.&nbsp; They&nbsp; were therefore&nbsp; properly&nbsp; rejected."<br></blockquote>For the foregoing reasons, these ballots should be rejected and&nbsp; deducted from the votes credited&nbsp; to petitioner.<br><br><i>Ballot Exh. "P", Precinct No. 25.</i>&nbsp; Respondent likewise questions the admission of this ballot&nbsp; on the ground that it was marked with the impertinent words "Enay Takya" before the name&nbsp; "Cefranca", a candidate for&nbsp; Councilor, written on the&nbsp; 3rd line for said office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is admitted that "Enay Takya" is the pet name of the wife of candidate Sefranca, the&nbsp; same can&nbsp; only be&nbsp; counted as a stray vote which does not invalidate the whole ballot&nbsp; (Rule 13, Section 149,&nbsp; Revised Election Code).&nbsp; This ballot was properly admitted.<br><br>In recapitulation, we&nbsp; find that two &lt;2)&nbsp; ballots (Exh. "3", Precinct No. 11 and Exh.&nbsp; "9", Precinct No. 27) were improperly admitted in favor of respondent Angel B. Tiu. These 2 votes should be deducted from 1,429 votes credited to him by the Court of Appeals, thereby leaving 1,427 votes.&nbsp; We also find that thirteen (13) ballots&nbsp; (Exhs. "A", "B", "D", "E", "F",&nbsp; "G'V'H", "I", "K","J",&nbsp; "L",&nbsp; "M", and "N", Precinct&nbsp; No. 25) were improperly&nbsp; counted for petitioner Mariano B. Delgado.&nbsp; These 13 votes should be. subtracted from&nbsp; 1,429 votes&nbsp; adjudicated to&nbsp; him&nbsp; by&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp; thereby leaving 1,416 votes.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is hereby modified in the sense that&nbsp; respondent Angel B. Tiu&nbsp; is the duly elected Mayor of Barugo, Leyte, with a plurality of eleven: (11) votes over petitioner Mariano B. Delgado,&nbsp; with costal against the petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C.
