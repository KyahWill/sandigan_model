				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA  ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>Maximo Sison  sometime in 1951  became the lessee of a  parcel of  land  situated  in  Sampaloc,  Manila, known as Lot No. 15-A,  Block No. 37 of  the Subdivision Plan of the  Legarda Estate on which  lot Sison erected a  house where, he lived with his family.</p>
<p>On February 9; 1954, Mauro Prieto,  the lessor, brought an action for ejectment against Sison before  the Municipal Court of  Manila for  nonpayment of  the agreed rental. On April  12, 1954, the municipal court  rendered judgment sentencing Sison to pay the sum of  P200.28  as unpaid rentals due  up to February 1954, plus the rentals that may  accrue  from March 1,  1954, at  the  rate of  P8.00 a  month  until  the property is vacated, plus  attorney's fees and  coats.   From this decision Sison appealed.</p>
<p>In his answer filed in the court of first instance  Sison alleged that he has been occupying the property for approximately 10 years; that he has never  refused to pay the rentals; and that he  has made  improvements thereon worth  P6,000.00.   Because of  Bison's  failure to  file  a supersedeas  bond,  plaintiff moved  for  the execution of the  judgment, including the demolition of Sison's  house.</p>
<p>The court gave Sison time within which  to deposit with the  court the amount of P137.00 representing rentals in arrears with the warning that should he fail to make that deposit the execution prayed for will  be issued.  In compliance with said order Sison made the deposit on September 23, 1957.</p>
<p>On December ,3,  1957, because of Sison's failure  to file a  supersedeas bond as well as to deposit the rentals that were becoming  due as embodied in the judgment of the municipal court, plaintiff again filed a motion for execution and  demolition.  This motion  was  granted in an  order issued on December. 10, 1957.</p>
<p>On December 15, 1957, Sison moved to quash the  order stating that  he  has already deposited the  proper amount to cover the rentals  in arrears and those that were becoming due, while on the other hand the lot  in dispute is already  included in the expropriation proceedings instituted  by  the Land  Tenure Administration pursuant to Section 1, Republic Act No. 1162, as amended by Republic Act  No. 1599.   The motion to  quash was denied.  Since the efforts made by Sison to have the order reconsidered failed,  he  interposed the present petition  for  certiorari.</p>
<p>It is contended that since petitioner  has already complied with the order of the trial court dated September 12, 1957 wherein he was required  to deposit  with the  clerk of court the amount of  P137.00 within a period  of 15 days, the trial court committed an abuse of discretion in issuing the order  of  execution of the  judgment of. the justice of the peace, including the demolition of petitioner's house, for the reason that the same has been issued without legal justification.</p>
<p>The order above referred to reads as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"In the decision of the lower court, the defendant, is sentenced to pay the sum of  P200.28 representing unpaid  rentals computed to include the rentals  up to February 1954 at the rate of P8.00 per month. The defendant started depositing the  said rentals only in June  1954  without filing a supersedeas bond.  Counting from March 1954 to August  1957  is 42 months, and at  the rate of P8.00 per month, it would total P336.00 which should  have been deposited with the Clerk of Court, but only P190.00 has so far been deposited, which was withdrawn  by the herein plaintiff  from  this  Court leaving still a balance of P137.00.  It is clear, therefore, that  the said defendant is in arrears by way of rentals  in  the said sum of P137.00 </p>
  <p>"Wherefore, the defendant is hereby ordered  to deposit with  the Clerk of Court the said amount  of  P137.00  within fifteen  (15) days from today.  If the payment of said  sum is not made at the end of said period of 15  days, the defendant should vacate  the premises  and  remove his house and other  improvements belonging to him within  sixty (60)  days  from today.  In the event this order is  not complied  with, the City  Sheriff of  Manila is hereby authorized  to  demolish  any. and all  buildings and  improvements belonging to the defendant in the premises  of the plaintiff."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It  is  apparent  that "the trial court  did not properly interpret  the law relative to the  steps to  be  taken  by defendant in an ejectment case against whom a judgment is rendered  requiring him  to pay back rentals and to restore  the  possession  of the  property  to the plaintiff, which makes it necessary  to  restate herein the  procedure to be followed by defendant should he desire to avert the execution  of the judgment  pending appeal.</p>
<p>The pertinent law  is  Rule  72, Section  8,  from  which the  following procedure may be inferred:  If  the judgment is in favor  of defendant there is  no judgment for possession that may be executed  because defendant  is entitled  to continue  in possession  of the  property.  But when the judgment  is  in  favor  of plaintiff the rule  requires that it be executed immediately in order to prevent further damages to him caused  by the  loss of his possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> However,  defendant may  stay  execution  (a) by perfecting an appeal and filing a supersedeas bond; and (b)  by paying  from time to  time either to  plaintiff or to the court  of  first instance,  during the pendency of the appeal; the amounts of  rentals or the reasonable  value of the use and occupation of  the property  as may be fixed by the justice of the peace court in its judgment This  rule is mandatory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the only exception being  when the delay is  due to fraud, accident, mistake or  excusable negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
<p>A  supersedeas  bond, on the other  hand,  has  for its purpose  to secure  payment of the  rents, damages and costs that may  have been adjudged in  the appealed  judgment, which bond becomes unnecessary if defendant deposits in court  the amount of  back rentals fixed in the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In  other  words,  the  supersedeas  bond answers only for back rentals as fixed in the judgment and not  for  those that may accrue during the pendency of the appeal which are guaranteed by the periodical deposits to be made by defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
<p>It would, therefore,  appear that the trial court  erred in denying the motion for execution by  allowing  petitioner to deposit the  amount necessary to  complete  not  only the back rents fixed in the judgment but also the  current rentals that  had  accrued  during the pendency  of the appeal, because such action is contrary to the procedure laid down in the  law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> As already stated,  if petitioner wanted to stay the  execution he should have put  up a supersedeas  bond  or  should have deposited  the amount necessary to pay the back rents.  This  he failed to do, although he made partial deposits to  cover current rentals which always fell short of those required  in the judgment. Verily, under  the law, plaintiff  became entitled to the writ  of execution prayed  for,  which the  court should have  granted outright, instead of issuing  the order quoted above.  But  the court rectified its mistake when it issued later  a writ of execution.  Hence,  the  present petition has no merit.</p>
<p>While it may be true that during  the  pendency of the ejectment  case  special  proceedings  were started  by the Land  Tenure  Administration  for the  expropriation  of several lots including the  lot in question pursuant to the provision of  Section 1, Republic Act No. 1162, as amended by  Republic  Act  No, 1599,  which action may  have the effect of suspending for a period of two years the present ejectment case, it should  be noted that  under Section 5 of  said Act  No. 1162 this benefit of suspension is only accorded to a defendant <em>who pays his current rentals,</em> and is not extended to one who is delinquent.   Here petitioner has proven to be a frequent delinquent tenant and as such is not entitled to the benefit of the law.</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is denied.   The writ of  injunction issued by this  Court is  dissolved.  No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
