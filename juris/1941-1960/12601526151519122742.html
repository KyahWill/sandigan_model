				<H3>GREGORIO ARONG, ET AL., PETITIONERS AND APPELLANTS, VS. VICTOR WAJING, ET AL., RESPONDENTS AND APPELLEES.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of
Cebu upholding the legality of the petitioners' removal from office by
the respondent Mayor, Victor Wajing. Appellants were former temporary
employees of the municipality of Cordova, Cebu.
  <p> In violation
of Section 17, Rule 48, of the Rules of Court, the appellants' brief
does not contain an assignment of errors. Dismissal of the appeal is in
order, not only because want of specific assignment of errors in the
appellants' brief is a ground therefor under section 1 (f) of Rule 52,
but because section 5 of Rule 53 provides that no error which does not
affect the jurisdiction over the subject matter will be considered
unless stated in the assignment of errors. We have time and again
enforced said reglementary provisions, and there is nothing in the
present case to warrant its exclusion from the established practice.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, the  appeal is dismissed with costs  against the appellants.   So ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Bengzon, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Barrera</i>, and <i>Gutierrez  David, JJ</i>.,  concur. </p>
