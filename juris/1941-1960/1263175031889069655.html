				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by petitioner Romulo Qua, an applicant for naturalization, from the decision of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Manila, denying his&nbsp; application.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Order is quite short and we are reproducing it, as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"ORDER<br></div><br>This is&nbsp; a petition for naturalization&nbsp; of Romulo Qua, a citizen&nbsp; of the Nationalist Republic of China,&nbsp; under whose laws Filipinos may become&nbsp; naturalized Chinese citizens.<br><br>He was <span style="font-style: italic;">allegedly </span>born in Manila on May 28, 1917, and has&nbsp; resided continuously in the Philippines&nbsp; since his birth and in the City&nbsp; of Manila&nbsp; at least one year prior to the filing of this petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is single and has been employed since 1955 and a salary of&nbsp; P300.00 per month in the Chua&nbsp; Po Chooh &amp; Co., which is a firm engaged in the textile business.&nbsp; He&nbsp; has had no formal education and acquired his knowledge of English thru private tutoring.<br><br>The petitioner has no birth certificate to prove that he was born in the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; In lieu thereof he presented&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Local Civil&nbsp; Registrar (Exhibit C) stating&nbsp; that the record&nbsp; of births of his office does&nbsp; not contain the name&nbsp; of Romulo Qua&nbsp; alleged to have been born on May 28, 1917.&nbsp; This document is not sufficient proof of his alleged birth in this country.&nbsp; Aside from this, there is a strong objection of the Philippine Army Headquarters to the petitioner's&nbsp; application&nbsp; for admission as citizen of the Philippines on the ground that 'in the interest of National&nbsp; Security' he should not be given G-2 clearance because of an unfavorable information about him existing&nbsp; in the files of the General Headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (Exhibit 4).&nbsp; He is suspected of subversive activities.&nbsp; Furthermore, the evidence shows that in the course of the hearing of his application for 6-2&nbsp; clearance he offered P5.00 to&nbsp; the investigating&nbsp; officer to&nbsp; expedite the proceeding.<br><br>Premises considered the petition for naturalization is hereby denied.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br>Manila, February 15, 1957.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">(Sgd.)&nbsp; Rafael Amparo<br>T. Rafael Amparo<br>Judge:"</div></blockquote>According to the&nbsp; unrefuted testimony of the petitioner, he was born in Manila on May 28, 1917&nbsp; of a Chinese father&nbsp; and&nbsp; a Filipino mother; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; has resided&nbsp; in the Philippines all the time up&nbsp; to the filing of his application for naturalization;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had&nbsp; studied&nbsp; under a private tutor in English and&nbsp; attained the equivalent of&nbsp; second year high school; that he is a duly registered alien, being a citizen of the Republic of Nationalist China; that he is a salesman in the Qua Po Chooh and&nbsp; Company, receiving a salary of P300.00 a month; that he&nbsp; knows the underlying principles of the Philippine Constitution;&nbsp; that he has mingled socially&nbsp; with the Filipinos and has&nbsp; adopted their customs, traditions and practices; that he does not believe in&nbsp; the practice of polygamy or&nbsp; in the&nbsp; use of force for the predominance of man's ideas; and&nbsp; that it is his intention in good faith to become a Filipino citizen.<br><br>The petitioner, through his&nbsp; counsel, tried&nbsp; to&nbsp; establish his birth in Manila by his&nbsp; own testimony, his Alien Certificate of Registration, his Native Born Certificate of Residence, and the testimony of Juliana Panganiban,&nbsp; a witness to&nbsp; his birth.&nbsp; The&nbsp; trial court, however, cut short her testimony, for the&nbsp; reason that, according to the said court, the best evidence is the record of birth.<br><br>In the case of Chua Guan Tan <i>vs.</i> Republic, 101 Phil., 164, 53 Off. Gaz., (18) 6107, thru Mr. Justice Endencia, we held that the fact of birth&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner was sufficiently proven, even in the absence&nbsp; of his certificate of birth, by the testimony&nbsp; of the petitioner&nbsp; himself,&nbsp; corroborated by an unsworn certificate&nbsp; of the doctor who purportedly at- tended the&nbsp; delivery.&nbsp; And in the case of Victoriano Yap Subieng <i>vs.</i> Republic, 102 Phil., 892; 56 Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; (14) 2940, thru&nbsp; Mr. Justice Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; we again said that:<br><blockquote>"Petitioner it is true did not file such declaration of intention, but this is because he claims to have&nbsp; been born in the Philippines, and this he has established not&nbsp; only by his own testimony and&nbsp; that of his father but by sufficient documentary evidence.&nbsp; Thus, he presented his Alien Certificate of Residence No. 40086 and his Native Born Certificate of Residence&nbsp; No. 57370, wherein it appears that he was born in Manila on May 5, 1923.&nbsp; There&nbsp; are official documents which were issued in due course by the immigration authorities and unless their genuineness&nbsp; is assailed, which was not, we have&nbsp; to give&nbsp; them due probative value. It is&nbsp; not therefore correct&nbsp; to say that&nbsp; the evidence of the petitioner on&nbsp; this point is not supported by documentary evidence."<br></blockquote>On the basis&nbsp; of the&nbsp; two above-cited&nbsp; cases, it is&nbsp; clear that the trial court erred&nbsp; in ruling that in the absence of a certificate of record of birth, the birth&nbsp; of petitioner in Manila&nbsp; could not be established by&nbsp; any&nbsp; other evidence. Moreover, it has also been shown that the petitioner has resided continuously in&nbsp; the Philippines for more than 30 years, thereby&nbsp; exempting him from the&nbsp; requirement of filing a declaration of intention.<br><br>The main objection of the&nbsp; trial court to the granting of petitioner's application&nbsp; for naturalization was&nbsp; the refusal of the Philippine Army&nbsp; G-2 Department to give him a clearance on the ground that he was suspected by two officers of the Philippine Army&nbsp; of subversive activities. A G-2 agent of the Philippine Army and Manuel Maravilla, a captain of the Armed&nbsp; Forces&nbsp; of the Philippines, testified as to the supposed subversive activities of the petitioner; but both witnesses refused to&nbsp; specify and reveal what those&nbsp; supposed subversive activities&nbsp; were on the ground that it was&nbsp; confidential&nbsp; and also for&nbsp; security reasons.&nbsp; They even refused to name the organization or entity supposedly communistic to which the petitioner was said to belong.&nbsp; We can not&nbsp; refuse or deny a petition for naturalization on mere suspicion from the Armed Forces of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; supposed to investigate alleged subversive activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; If those&nbsp; suspicions are based&nbsp; on and supported by facts they should be placed on record so that petitioner may have an opportunity to examine them and, if possible, refute them.<br><br>On the other hand, the evidence presented on behalf of&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; is quite impressive.&nbsp; Besides&nbsp; the testimony&nbsp; of his two character witnesses, Primitivo S.&nbsp; Concepcion and Simeon C. Raymundo, petitioner has established the fact that he has been getting Certificates of Residence "A" and "W" for several years; that he has been paying his income&nbsp; taxes;&nbsp; that&nbsp; he is a&nbsp; Catholic and&nbsp; has been regularly attending church services in Binondo and Quiapo; that he has obtained&nbsp; a&nbsp; Tax Clearance certificate&nbsp; for Naturalization&nbsp; (Exhibit K); that he is a member of the Philippine Veterans Legion&nbsp; (Exhibit N); that he has at clearance certificate from the Manila Police Department, from the Office&nbsp; of&nbsp; the City&nbsp; Fiscal of Manila, from the Philippine Constabulary, from the Bureau of Immigration, from the&nbsp; Deportation Board,&nbsp; from the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Manila, from the Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities, House of Representatives, from the Land Registration Commission, from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Anti-Dummy Board of the Department of Justice, from the Central Bank of the Philippines,&nbsp; from the Bureau of&nbsp; Prisons, and from the National Intelligence&nbsp; Coordinating Agency.&nbsp; All these clearances&nbsp; in the form of exhibits were presented and admitted in evidence by the court without objection on the part of the Government.&nbsp; When he was questioned about his knowledge of the Government of, the Philippines and its high officials, his&nbsp; answers were more than satisfactory.<br><br>Then there is the incident that when petitioner was being investigated by the G-2 of the Philippine&nbsp; Army,&nbsp; he gave the sum of five pesos to the G-2 Agent, Fortunato P. Jose, which the latter official&nbsp; considered to be a sort of bribe to cut short the investigation, but&nbsp; which the petitioner stoutly denied claiming that he gave the&nbsp; money to&nbsp; buy food for him (petitioner) because he had not taken any breakfast in his hurry to attend the investigation at seven o'clock in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; incident was&nbsp; investigated&nbsp; by the Armed Forces, but no positive step was taken toward prosecuting petitioner for the supposed attempted bribe.&nbsp; On the other hand, all that the Army could present in&nbsp; evidence is the statement&nbsp; made by&nbsp; petitioner before them (Exhibit 2) for the Government,&nbsp; wherein he admitted having delivered the sum of five pesos to Mr.&nbsp; Jose, but at the same time claimed that it was&nbsp; only to buy food for him&nbsp; because he was already feeling hungry not having had breakfast and the investigation lasted&nbsp; until three o'clock in&nbsp; the afternoon and the investigator refusing to let him go out to eat.<br><br>After&nbsp; the trial court&nbsp; had&nbsp; denied&nbsp; his&nbsp; application for naturalization,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; for new&nbsp; trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.&nbsp; Although said evidence may have&nbsp; been&nbsp; available&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing, petitioner,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; did not expect that&nbsp; his&nbsp; application would be turned down on the&nbsp; ground of supposedly communistic activities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, he&nbsp; saw no reason or necessity for&nbsp; presenting&nbsp; further&nbsp; evidence.&nbsp; He desires to be given that opportunity to present&nbsp; the testimonies of John E.&nbsp; Curtin, attorney, a U. S.&nbsp; citizen and&nbsp; a resident&nbsp; of Manila;&nbsp; and Lt. Col. Amadeo&nbsp; M. Cabe, Inf., P.C. whose affidavits we reproduce below&nbsp; to the effect that the petitioner could not possibly be or have been engaged in communist activities because he was a member of the Guerrilla during the war, that he took an important&nbsp; part therein. and that he also served in&nbsp; the U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Government:<br><blockquote>"REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES<br>CITY OF MANILA<br><br><center>AFFIDAVIT<br></center><br>I. JOHN E. CURTIN, an attorney and United States&nbsp; citizen of legal age, presently residing at No. 1967 Azcarraga St., Manila, Philippine Republic, after having been duly sworn in accordance to law hereby depose and say:<br><br>That I have known ROMULO QUA, a Chinese National, residing at 209 San Vicente St., Manila, P.I. since&nbsp; July 1945,&nbsp; when I was a C.I.D.&nbsp; Agent for the U.&nbsp; S. Army.<br><br>That after a&nbsp; most careful background&nbsp; investigation particularly into any possible Communistic affiliations or connections, I had the C.I.D.&nbsp; employ ROMULO QUA, and had him enrolled in late 1945, as a member&nbsp; of the Manila&nbsp; Police Department.&nbsp; The&nbsp; character&nbsp; and background investigation of ROMULO QUA, made at that time, showed! him to be a former legitimate guerrilla of the COWHM group, and showed furthermore that he had&nbsp; fought in the hills for several months against&nbsp; the, Japanese armed&nbsp; forces.&nbsp; He was moreover&nbsp; &amp;. rabid&nbsp; anti-communist.<br><br>ROMULO QUA worked directly under me for&nbsp; several months in 1945, and for two months in&nbsp; 1946, mainly gathering and&nbsp; furnishing information of the activities of the&nbsp; Communist Wha Chi and Kung Fan groups.&nbsp; His life was endangered&nbsp; by these groups on at&nbsp; least two occasions that I know of while he worked for me.<br><br>That I have&nbsp; known him intimately&nbsp; since that time for he&nbsp; has called&nbsp; on me repeatedly&nbsp; over and past&nbsp; ten&nbsp; years.&nbsp; In&nbsp; our&nbsp; conversations during these visits Qua has frequently shown his&nbsp; continued&nbsp; anti-communist feelings.<br><br>Any information that the Philippine Army's G-2 or&nbsp; M.I.S. sections possesses that Romulo Qua has ever participated in any subversive activity against&nbsp; the Philippine Government,&nbsp; could&nbsp; only have come from a most unreliable source and is totally untrue.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are few if any Chinese citizens in the Philippines who have served the Philippine government, without&nbsp; remuneration, more loyally&nbsp; than&nbsp; Qua. Moreover he is&nbsp; a man of the highest moral principles and&nbsp; honor, and would be an&nbsp; asset to the Philippines as a&nbsp; citizen of the Republic.
