				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Plaintiffs&nbsp; (nine in&nbsp; number,&nbsp; hereinafter called&nbsp; Millare-Ballena)&nbsp; filed Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 94 in the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Abra,&nbsp; claiming&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; over&nbsp; eight&nbsp;&nbsp; (8) parcels of land.&nbsp; Originally,&nbsp; there&nbsp; were&nbsp; two groups&nbsp; of defendants, which for convenience we may designate,&nbsp; the first group as Millare-Lazo and the second, composed of husband and wife, as Adame-Tabor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; complaint seeks recovery of&nbsp; parcels 2, 3, 4,&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 6, 7&nbsp; and 8 from Millare-Lazo&nbsp; and&nbsp; of parcel 1&nbsp; from&nbsp; Adame-Tabor,&nbsp; with prayer for damages&nbsp; and costs.<br><br>Later, upon&nbsp; motion of&nbsp; defendants Adame-Tabor&nbsp; who claimed parcel 1, two other individuals, to be referred to as Cariño-Tabor, were included as additional&nbsp; defendants, because&nbsp; they too claimed&nbsp; ownership of this lot&nbsp; No. 1. Upon&nbsp; being&nbsp; impleaded,&nbsp; Cariño-Tabor filed&nbsp; a cross-claim against Adame-Tabor.&nbsp; Hence, with respect&nbsp; to this Parcel 1, there&nbsp; was&nbsp; a three-cornered controversy&nbsp; among&nbsp; the plaintiffs Millare-Ballena,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendants Adame-Tabor, and&nbsp; the additional&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; Cariño-Tabor.<br><br>After&nbsp; due&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint, confirming the title of defendant Flora Lazo over Parcels 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and affirming the claim of&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; Cariño-Tabor over Parcel 1. Plaintiffs Millare-Ballena appealed from this&nbsp; decision dismissing the&nbsp; complaint to the Court&nbsp; of Appeals,&nbsp; and there the appeal was dismissed 4on July 9, 1958, for failure to pay the docket fee and the estimated cost of printing of the record&nbsp; on appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Final&nbsp; judgment was entered on August 16, 1958 and the record was remanded&nbsp; to the lower court on October 21, 1958 (See certification of the&nbsp; Deputy Clerk of Court at Large&nbsp; of the Court of&nbsp; Appeals dated 1 July 22, 1959), Defendants&nbsp; Adame-Tabor,&nbsp; or&nbsp; specifically,&nbsp; defendant Marcela Tabor, appealed from the portion of&nbsp; the decision finding&nbsp; the&nbsp; other&nbsp; defendants&nbsp;&nbsp; Cariño-Tabor&nbsp;&nbsp; entitled to Parcel 1 and&nbsp; ordering appellant Marcela&nbsp; Tabor to vacate the same and to pay Cariño-Tabor&nbsp; (the latter substituted by&nbsp; his&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; upon&nbsp; his&nbsp; death during the&nbsp; course&nbsp; of the proceedings) the sum of P9,760.00 and the&nbsp; additional sum of P800.00 per year from 1956 until she&nbsp; finally&nbsp; vacates the&nbsp; land,&nbsp; plus&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P300.00&nbsp; as&nbsp; damages.&nbsp; This appeal of Marcela Tabor was taken directly to this Court, wherein appellant raises only a question of law, contained in her&nbsp; single assignment of error, to wit: "THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE CROSS-COMPLAINT OF MARCELA TABOR"..<br><br>This&nbsp; sole assignment of error is undoubtedly&nbsp; directed against the finding of the lower court as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"In view hereof, the Court holds that there is no need of analyzing and evaluating the evidence presented by Marcela Tabor in support of her claim in answer to the cross-claim, Marcela&nbsp; Tabor is now estopped from questioning&nbsp; the validity&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sale in favor of Jose Cariño and Felix Tabor.&nbsp; Pio&nbsp; Adame, having&nbsp; in the words of the Court of Appeals 'eschewed his share in the land,' the whole parcel 1 belongs now to Jose Cariño and Felix Tabor,"<br></blockquote>The basis of the legal conclusion of the&nbsp; trial court is Case No. 35 of the same Court of First Instance of Abra covering the same Parcel 1&nbsp; and between the&nbsp; same parties. The facts of this case,&nbsp; as they&nbsp; appear in&nbsp; the appealed decision,&nbsp; are briefly&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:<br><br>Jose Cariño and Felix Tabor filed&nbsp; a complaint against Pio Adame for the partition of the same Parcel&nbsp; I, alleging that the&nbsp; three had purchased the land from one Francisca Flores and that&nbsp; Adame&nbsp; later&nbsp; refused to give plaintiffs their&nbsp; share in&nbsp; the produce of the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; Adame,&nbsp; in&nbsp; his answer,&nbsp; disclaimed any&nbsp; interest&nbsp; in the land and&nbsp; denied that he&nbsp; had bought&nbsp; the land with&nbsp; plaintiffs.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Adame's wife, Marcela Tabor, filed a complaint in intervention claiming the land&nbsp; as&nbsp; her&nbsp; own for having acquired&nbsp; it from&nbsp; Francisca Flores by way of donation inter&nbsp; vivos and impugning the deed&nbsp; of sale in favor of Cariño and Tabor as&nbsp; fraudulent and fictitious and,&nbsp; therefore, null and void.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon these pleadings, the case went to trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the hearing, during which evidence both testimonial and documentary was presented by both parties in support&nbsp; of their respective&nbsp; contentions, the trial court rendered judgment&nbsp;&nbsp; expressly finding&nbsp; as&nbsp; satisfactorily proven the following&nbsp; facts: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="center">(a)</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">That Francisca Flores, the undisputed owner of the land, sold the same absolutely and irrevocably in favor of Jose Cariño, Felix Tabor and Pio Adame for P300.00 by virtue of a public document Exh. 3 executed on June 21, 1937 and registered in the Register of Deeds on August 16, 1939; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> That since the execution of the deed of sale, the purchasers took possession of the land and divided its produce equally up to 1940; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That in 1941, Pio Adame took advantage of the chaotic condition during the Japanese occupation and refused to give participation to his co-owners alleging that the land had been donated to his wife, Marcela Tabor, by Francisca Flores;,</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(d) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">That in 1938, Jose Cariño declared the land in his name for land tax purposes (Exh. 2) although later he included the name of Felix Tabor (Exh. 2-a), but excluding Pio Adame for the reason stated in (c);</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(e)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That Cariño and Tabor had been paying the land taxes as evidenced by Exhs. 3 to 3-e; . </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(f) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">That on May 10, 1940, that is, three (3) years after the execution of the deed of sale Exh. 1, Francisca Flores donated the land to Marcela Tabor for services. rendered Exh. "A"; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(g)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That Marcela Tabor also declared the same land in her name and had been paying the land taxes since April, 1943 (Exhs. B, C to C-3); </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(h) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">That at the time of the execution of Exh. 1, Francisca Flores was not blind; and</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(i)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">That she died in March, 1943.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote>Upon these findings and after declaring that&nbsp; the deed&nbsp; of sale Exh.&nbsp; 1 in favor of Carino,&nbsp; Tabor and&nbsp; Adame&nbsp; is not void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> nor voidable and that since Francisca Flores was no longer&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner at&nbsp; the time of&nbsp; the&nbsp; alleged donation, Marcela Tabor acquired no&nbsp; right over&nbsp; the land, the&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; judgement&nbsp; the dispositive part of which&nbsp; reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"EN VIRTUD DE TODO&nbsp; LO EXPUESTO, el&nbsp; Juzgado dicta decision&nbsp; en este asunto absolviendo de la demanda de terceria a Jose Cariño y Felix Tabor, o desistimando de piano las pretenciones&nbsp; de la demandante tercerista&nbsp; Marcela Tabor y&nbsp; condenando a esta a pagar las costas del juicio. <br>"ASI SE ORDERNA. <br>"Bangued, Abra, 27 de Octubre de&nbsp; 1948."<br></blockquote>From this judgment Marcela Tabor appealed to the Court of Appeals, which court,&nbsp; after&nbsp; reviewing&nbsp; the&nbsp; evidence, came to the same&nbsp; conclusion, holding that "the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; in question is valid and&nbsp; subsisting"; that "there&nbsp; is no merit to appellants' motion for new&nbsp; trial" and that "the affidavit,&nbsp; Exhibit E,&nbsp; (upon which reliance&nbsp; is&nbsp; urged in this present appeal)&nbsp; cannot be admitted in evidence"; and&nbsp; accordingly rendered judgment, the dispositive part of which is as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding no error&nbsp; in the judgment appealed from, the same is hereby&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the intervenor appellant Marcela Tabor. "it is so&nbsp; ordered."<br></blockquote>In view of these previous&nbsp; decisions, the&nbsp; trial court, in this present case,&nbsp; declared in&nbsp; effect that&nbsp; the&nbsp; matter of the&nbsp; validity of&nbsp; the deed&nbsp; of sale in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of appelees Cariño-Tabor is already <i>res adjudicata</i> and&nbsp; Marcela Tabor is now estopped from questioning the same.<br><br>This is the supposed error which appellant now contends the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; has committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her submission&nbsp; is that the&nbsp; abovequoted dispositive&nbsp; portions of the&nbsp; decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals in Case&nbsp; No. 35 did&nbsp; not have any reference&nbsp; to the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; at all, and since&nbsp; only the dispositive part or <i>fallo</i> in&nbsp; a decision is what constitutes "judgment",&nbsp; the&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; pronouncements&nbsp; made elsewhere in the previous decisions are not conclusive.&nbsp; In support of&nbsp; this contention, appellant cited the cases of Government <i>vs.</i> Ramon y Vasquez, et&nbsp; al. (73 Phil.,&nbsp; 669) and&nbsp; Contreras,&nbsp; et al. <i>vs.</i> Felix,&nbsp; et al.&nbsp; (78 Phil,, 570).<br><br>The&nbsp; statements "the judgment or <i>fallo</i> is found in the dispositive part of the decision" (Ramon y&nbsp; Vasquez case) and "there is a distinction between the findings and conclusions of a court and its&nbsp; judgment—as expressed in the dispositive part, so called, of the decision" (Contreras case)&nbsp; are&nbsp; correct&nbsp; when considered in the light&nbsp; of the facts of those cases or in cases of similar facts.&nbsp;&nbsp; But they cannot be&nbsp; lifted&nbsp; out of context and&nbsp; applied as inflexible doctrines in all&nbsp; situations.&nbsp; In fact&nbsp; a reading of those decisions will reveal their limited&nbsp; application; the&nbsp; Ramon case, to cases where the dispositive part is not ambiguous or is a complete&nbsp; adjudication by itself, and the Contreras case, to "lapses, findings, loose statements and generalities <i>which&nbsp; do not bear on the issues or are apparently opposed to the&nbsp; otherwise sound and considered result reached&nbsp; by the court as expressed in the dispositive part,</i> so called, of the decision".<br><br>The dispositive parts of the decisions&nbsp; of both courts, in Case No.&nbsp; 35, while not ambiguous, are, by themselves alone, far from&nbsp; being complete&nbsp; and final&nbsp; adjudications of&nbsp; the issues involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; findings&nbsp; and&nbsp; conclusions contained in the&nbsp; body of the decisions (that the deed of sale in favor of&nbsp; Carino-Tabor was neither void&nbsp; <i>ab-initio</i> nor voidable, but valid and subsisting and&nbsp; that&nbsp; Marcela Tabor did not acquire any right&nbsp; over the land)&nbsp; are, not only not opposed to the result&nbsp; reached by the court but precisely the very basis thereof, the very <i>ratio decidendi</i> of the judgment&nbsp; dismissing the complaint in intervention of Marcela Tabor, and&nbsp; of&nbsp; the affirmance&nbsp; by the appellate court of&nbsp; that&nbsp; appealed judgment.&nbsp; Appellant's citations of authorities&nbsp; are, therefore,&nbsp; inapplicable. <br><br>On October 1, 1957, a motion for contempt was filed in this Court by appellant Marcela&nbsp; Tabor charging defendants-appellees Jose Cariño, Felix Tabor's widow, Gabina Terrenal,&nbsp; and&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Flora&nbsp; Lazo with&nbsp; having&nbsp; committed an abuse of, or an&nbsp; unlawful interference with, the process or proceedings of&nbsp; a court&nbsp; (Section 3 [c]&nbsp; of Rule 64)&nbsp; by selling or otherwise&nbsp; disposing&nbsp; of the&nbsp; land in question pending&nbsp; this appeal.&nbsp; There being no attachment, injunction or receivership&nbsp; issued with respect to the land and in view of the conclusion&nbsp; reached on the merits of the case, we see no reason&nbsp; to declare&nbsp; the respondents guilty&nbsp; of&nbsp; contempt.&nbsp; The&nbsp; petition&nbsp; is denied.<br><br>The appealed&nbsp; decision being in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with law, the same is affirmed, with costs against the&nbsp; appellant. It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Endencia,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
