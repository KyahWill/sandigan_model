				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On July 16, 1958, appellant entered his appearance as counsel for the accused in Criminal Case No. 44304 pending in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp; On July 23,&nbsp; 1958, appellant received copy of a notice setting the hearing of the case on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1958.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; same date he received copy of said notice, he filed a motion for transfer for the reason that on August 5 and 6, 1958 he will appear as counsel for the accused in a criminal case for&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; in band pending before the Court of First Instance of Quezon attesting to the fact that appellant did upon agreement&nbsp; made&nbsp; between the prosecution and the defense on June&nbsp; 6, 1958,&nbsp; at the same time praying that the hearing be set on August 4 or 11, 1958 if the calendar of the&nbsp; court would so&nbsp; permit. This motion was denied on&nbsp; July 24,&nbsp; 1958&nbsp; of which&nbsp; appellant&nbsp; was notified&nbsp; on July 29, 1958.<br><br>Upon&nbsp; being notified&nbsp; of this denial, appellant filed&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; withdraw his&nbsp; appearance as&nbsp; counsel for&nbsp; the accused for the reason that&nbsp; he could&nbsp; not attend&nbsp; to the hearing of the case set for August 5, 1958 on account of his previous commitment with the Court of First Instance of Quezon, furnishing a copy of his motion to the accused. On August&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1958, the accused filed a motion for postponement giving&nbsp; as ground&nbsp; the&nbsp; withdrawal&nbsp; of his attorney,&nbsp; but the court denied both&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; of appellant to withdraw and the motion&nbsp; of the accused&nbsp; to&nbsp; postpone the hearing,&nbsp; and on August 5, 1958, it&nbsp; issued an&nbsp; order citing appellant to appear to show&nbsp; cause why he&nbsp; should not be punished for contempt for his failure to appear at the hearing of the case set on said date.&nbsp; Appellant appeared before&nbsp; the court as ordered, and&nbsp; by way&nbsp; of explanation&nbsp; he reiterated what&nbsp; he&nbsp; had&nbsp; already advanced before to the effect that his failure was due to his appearance as counsel for the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; at the&nbsp; hearing of&nbsp; the criminal case pending before the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Quezon&nbsp; which&nbsp; was set long prior to the hearing&nbsp; of the present case.&nbsp; This explanation not having been found satisfactory,&nbsp; the court declared&nbsp; appellant guilty of contempt and imposed upon him a&nbsp; fine of F25.&nbsp; Hence this appeal.<br><br>It&nbsp; appears that when appellant&nbsp; received on&nbsp; July 23, 1953&nbsp; the notice setting the hearing of the instant case on August 5, 1958, he filed on&nbsp; the same date a&nbsp; motion for postponement&nbsp; giving as reason&nbsp; the fact that on that same date of August 5, 1958 he will&nbsp; appear as counsel for the accused in the case of robbery in band pending before the Court of First Instance of Quezon, the hearing of which was set upon agreement made between the prosecution and&nbsp; the defense in open court on June 6, 1958. It likewise appears that this&nbsp; agreement took place much prior to the institution of the&nbsp; instant case and even before appellant entered his appearance as counsel for the accused, and these facts appear undisputed for at the hearing of the motion citing&nbsp; appellant for contempt&nbsp; he submitted a certification&nbsp; of the clerk of court of the Court of First Instance of Quezon attesting to the fact that appellant did in fact appear&nbsp; as counsel for the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; on August 5 and 6, 1958&nbsp; in the case pending before that court.&nbsp; And to show that appellant moved to postpone&nbsp; the&nbsp; hearing not for purposes of delay but for a justifiable reason,&nbsp; he asked" that the hearing be postponed to August&nbsp; 4 or 11, 1958, which&nbsp; is one day before or several days after the date&nbsp; set for that&nbsp; purpose by the&nbsp; trial court.&nbsp; But notwithstanding this&nbsp; explanation, appellant was found&nbsp; guilty and was convicted.&nbsp; He now comes&nbsp; to this Court alleging that the trial court committed&nbsp; a grave abuse of&nbsp; discretion. While it is a settled doctrine that a motion to&nbsp; postpone is not a matter&nbsp; of right (Linis <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rovira, 61 Phil., 137; Parina&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Cabangbang, G. R.&nbsp; No. L-8398,&nbsp; March 21, 1956), but a matter&nbsp; that is addressed to the sound discretion of the court (Dimayuga <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Dimayuga, 51 Off. Gaz., No. 5, 2397;&nbsp; Bautista <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. The Municipal Council of Mandaluyong, Rizal, et al., 98 Phil., 409), there are however cases where the granting of the motion becomes imperative to afford substantial justice.&nbsp; As this Court has aptly said: "While the granting or refusal of motions for continuance is discretionary, that discretion must be exercised wisely with a view to substantial justice"&nbsp; (Capitol&nbsp; Subdivision <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Province of Negros Occidental, 99&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 633).&nbsp; The discretion should be exercised in the light of the peculiar circumstances obtaining in each case.<br><br>In the instant case, appellant appears to&nbsp; have the&nbsp; law on his side; and to show this suffice it to quote what the Solicitor General&nbsp; says on&nbsp; the matter:&nbsp; "He&nbsp; deserved&nbsp; a more sympathetic understanding of&nbsp; his&nbsp; plight than&nbsp; he was able&nbsp; to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court,&nbsp; zealous as&nbsp; it was undoubtedly for&nbsp; a speedy trial of the principal case. When appellant committed&nbsp; himself to a trial&nbsp; for August 5&nbsp; and 6, 1958&nbsp; at&nbsp; Lucena, Quezon&nbsp; in&nbsp; People of&nbsp; the Philippines <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Juan Masaes for Robbery&nbsp; in Band, the agreement was made in open&nbsp; court on June 6,&nbsp; 1958 between the&nbsp; prosecution and&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense * * * at&nbsp; a&nbsp; time&nbsp; when the case against the&nbsp; herein accused Antonio&nbsp; Martinez had not even been filed in court.&nbsp; The instant case for grave threats&nbsp; was only&nbsp; filed on June 12, 1958 and&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellant filed his appearance&nbsp; herein on July&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1958 when&nbsp; the hearing at the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Quezon had already been&nbsp; calendared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the circumstances, he immediately filed on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 1958 a motion&nbsp; to transfer the date of the hearing&nbsp; for&nbsp; grave threats&nbsp; to August&nbsp; 4 or 11, 1958.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact alone that appellant was willing to go to trial on August 4, one day before the actual date selected by the lower&nbsp; court in the grave&nbsp; threats case is convincing proof that appellant's motion for&nbsp; postponement was&nbsp; not dilatory, but a solution to his predicament, considering his commitment at the Quezon court."&nbsp; We fully agree to this comment.<br><br>The Elks Club<span style="font-style: italic;"> vs</span>.
