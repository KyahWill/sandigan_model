				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">As this is an appeal by certiorari, we are hereby adopting the following narration of facts contained in&nbsp; the decision of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>Plaintiffs&nbsp; Leonora Manaois,&nbsp; Gregorio Manaois,&nbsp; Juliana Manaois and Inocencia Manaois and defendant Florencio Manaois arc brothers and sisters and, together with&nbsp; a&nbsp; niece,&nbsp; one Francisca de&nbsp; Guzman, who is not a&nbsp; party to this action, were formerly&nbsp; owners pro-indiviso and in&nbsp; common of the&nbsp; parcel of land&nbsp; described in the complaint. This parcel&nbsp;&nbsp; of land, which&nbsp; is&nbsp; situated&nbsp; in the&nbsp; barrio of&nbsp; Lomboy, municipality&nbsp; of Binmalcy, Province of Pangasinan, and contains an area of&nbsp; 18,975 square meters,&nbsp; more or&nbsp; less, Is rural, and&nbsp; it was one of&nbsp; three lots which the above named persons&nbsp; inherited from Cenon Manaois, father of tho first five and grandfather of the last.<br><br>"On January 10, 1943, the properties left by Cenon Manaois were partitioned among his heirs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that partition, which recorded in a public deed&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; "1"),&nbsp; the lot described in complaint was&nbsp; adjudicated&nbsp; as&nbsp; follows:&nbsp; one-fourth, towards&nbsp; its southeastern&nbsp; side to Gregorio Manaois; one-fourth, towards its southwestern side, to Florencio&nbsp; Manaois;&nbsp; one-eighth,&nbsp; towards its norther to Francisca de Guzman; one-eighth, towards&nbsp; its northeaste side, to Leonora Manaois, and&nbsp; one-eighth, towards its northweste sidet to Inocencia&nbsp; Manaois.&nbsp; Aftex the execution of this deed, the parties thereto entered into the possession of the portions of l respectively adjudicated to them.<br><br>"On April 2, 1943, Florencio Manaois, in consideration the sum of P500, paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; him by&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Jose Zamora, sold and conveyed to the latter his one-fourth&nbsp; share in&nbsp; the above- mentioned lot, and executed for the&nbsp; purpose of a public deed&nbsp; of conveyance (Exhibit "2").&nbsp; On the same&nbsp; date, after the execution of this deed of sale, Jose Zamora constituted himself in the land conveyed to him and&nbsp; took&nbsp; possession&nbsp; thereof in&nbsp; the&nbsp; presence&nbsp; and with the acquiescense of Gregorio Manaois, and&nbsp; the letter's brothers-in Miguel Fabia and Crescendo&nbsp; Rosario,&nbsp; husbands of Leonora Manaois&nbsp; and Inocencia Manaois, respectively, whom&nbsp; he found in the place.<br><br>"On April 30, 1043,&nbsp; Zamora&nbsp; went to the law firm De la Pe√±a Cruz,&nbsp; Arboleda and&nbsp; Pefia, in&nbsp; Lingayen,&nbsp; Pangasinan, get the certificate of&nbsp; title&nbsp; covering&nbsp; the property&nbsp; acquired which, he&nbsp; was told,&nbsp; was&nbsp; in&nbsp; the possession of said&nbsp; law&nbsp; firm Attorney Arboleda&nbsp; of&nbsp; the firm&nbsp; told Zamora that if he wanted to have the certificate of title he had to&nbsp; bring at least one of the children of the deceased Cenon Manaois and pay the amount of P45 which said deceased&nbsp; owed their firm. Thus&nbsp; advised, Zamora&nbsp; went back to Binmaley and&nbsp; in succession&nbsp; asked&nbsp; Inocencia,&nbsp; Juliana Leonora Manaois to accompany him to the office of Attorney Arboleda, but these sisters&nbsp; refused&nbsp; and referred him to their&nbsp; brother Gregorio Manaoia.&nbsp; The latter agreed, and&nbsp; on May 1, 1943,&nbsp; he accompanied Zamora to&nbsp; the&nbsp; office of&nbsp; Attorney Arboleda, who upon being paid the sum of P45, immediately&nbsp; executed the necessary deed of release and told&nbsp; Zamora and&nbsp; Gregorio Manaois to record&nbsp; the same in the office of&nbsp; the&nbsp; register&nbsp; of deeds, from which&nbsp; they&nbsp; could get the certificate of title of the property of Cenon&nbsp; Manaois. Zamora&nbsp; and Gregorio&nbsp; Manaois presented this deed of release in the office of the register of deeds on May 3,&nbsp; 1943, and, after paying the necessary fees, they were&nbsp; given&nbsp; the owner's duplicate of two certificates of title.&nbsp; Kamora retained the title which covered his property (owner's duplicate of certificate of title&nbsp; No. 52914) and gave the other to Gregorio&nbsp; Manaois.<br><br>"Once in the&nbsp; possession of the duplicate of&nbsp; certificate of title No. 52914, Zamora presented the deed of conveyance of the property in the office of the register&nbsp; of deeds.&nbsp; He was, however, advised that said deed cannot be recorded unless a copy of the deed of partition of the lot among the heirs of Cenon Manaois be also presented for record.&nbsp; Due to&nbsp; the difficulties encountered&nbsp; by Zamora to secure&nbsp; a copy of the deed of partition, he did&nbsp; not insist&nbsp; on&nbsp; the registration of the&nbsp; deed of conveyance&nbsp; above referred to.<br><br>"However, on&nbsp; July&nbsp; 22, 1940, Zamora went&nbsp; back&nbsp; to the office of the register of deeds&nbsp; for Pangasinan and&nbsp; once more presented the deed of conveyance above-refened to for record, advising said office why he could not file&nbsp; the deed of partition.&nbsp; The register of deeds, upon being advised of the situation, accepted&nbsp; the deed and entered it in the entry book of his office.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the same date, July 22, 1946, the plaintiffs commenced this action."<br></blockquote>The action instituted by the plaintiffs&nbsp; (herein petitioners)&nbsp; was for legal redemption&nbsp; under&nbsp; Articles&nbsp; 1523 and 1524 of the old Civil Code.&nbsp; The petitioners lost both in the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pangasinan and in the Court of&nbsp; Appeals, and the case is&nbsp; now before us&nbsp; on review&nbsp; by certiorari.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the deed&nbsp; conveying the land in question to respondent Jose Zamora was registered on July 22, 1946, when the present action was commenced. It&nbsp; also found&nbsp; that the evidence "clearly shows that the plaintiffs&nbsp; (herein petitioners)&nbsp; had knowledge&nbsp; of the sale in&nbsp; question since its execution on April 2, 1943."<br><br>The petitioners&nbsp; admit&nbsp; that&nbsp; the law involved&nbsp; is Article 1524&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; old Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; providing&nbsp; that&nbsp; "the right of legal&nbsp; redemption can be&nbsp; exercised only within nine days, counted&nbsp; from, the&nbsp; inscription&nbsp; in the registry, and in the absence thereof from the time the redemptioner&nbsp; shall have had&nbsp; knowledge of the sale,"&nbsp; and that the only question to be decided is whether the nine-day period should start from July 22, 1946 (date of registration), or from April 2, 1943&nbsp; (when petitioners had actual knowledge).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeals sustained the view&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; starting point is the latter date.<br><br>We agree.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of Spain, in its decisions of December 14, 1905 and June 30,&nbsp; 1910, had already held that the date of registration was intended to be applied to all cases where the date of actual knowledge is unknown, the idea being that knowledge of the sale may be presumed from its&nbsp; mere&nbsp; registration; and&nbsp; not to cases&nbsp; where the date&nbsp; of prior knowledge&nbsp; is determined, otherwise a&nbsp; legal presumption would be given more importance than a real fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; following is the commentary of Manresa:&nbsp; "El Codigo, dice la sentencia de 14 de&nbsp; Diciembre de 1905, no quiere&nbsp; establecer para todos los&nbsp; casos de titulos sujetos a inscripcion,&nbsp; un plazo uniforme de nueve dias a contar desde ella para ejercitar el retracto, sino solo para el easo de no poder acreditarse si el, retrayente tuvo o&nbsp; no conocimiento anterior de la venta,&nbsp; caso en el que establece una presuncion&nbsp; juris&nbsp; et de jure, basada&nbsp; en la publicidad de registro.&nbsp; Si el retrayente conocia la venta, el plazo&nbsp; ha de contarse desde ese conocimiento: lo&nbsp; mismo viene a afirmar, en el fondo, la sentencia de 30&nbsp; de Junio de&nbsp; 1910.&nbsp;&nbsp; (10 Manresa, 340, 4th&nbsp; ed.)"<br><br>We can&nbsp; think of no valid justification for departing from the rule&nbsp; laid down&nbsp; by the Supreme Court of Spain. It is&nbsp; desirable that purchasers of real property&nbsp; should not be left guessing or in suspense as&nbsp; to the status&nbsp; of&nbsp; their title, so as&nbsp; to allow or enable them to decide without delay on what to do with&nbsp; said property.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true&nbsp; that, as intimated by&nbsp; counsel for the petitioners, the&nbsp; matter of registering a&nbsp; sale is within the&nbsp; power of the purchaser who&nbsp; should be blamed for any delayed registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there may be instances where, as in the case at bar, early registration cannot be effected due to the legitimate causes beyond the&nbsp; control of the purchaser.&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp; other hand, a redemptioner who has&nbsp; actual knowledge is afforded the same,&nbsp; if&nbsp; not more, opportunity to&nbsp; exercise his right, as a redemptioner charged with knowledge of the&nbsp; sale merely in virtue of a registration.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; appealed decision is&nbsp; affirmed, and it is so ordered&nbsp; with costs against the petitioners.<br><br><i>Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
