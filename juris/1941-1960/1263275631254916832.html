				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Statement.</span> On  June 14, 1956, Mayor Generoso B. Tokong of Labason, Zamboanga del Norte,  suspended Sergio G. Martinez from his office as Chief of  Police of the Municipality for "negligence in the prosecution of  offenses and malicious delay in the administration of justice." <br><br>Ninety days  thereafter, on September  14, 1956, Martinez filed this  mandamus proceeding in the court of first instance there to obtain reinstatement plus the payment of his corresponding  salary. <br><br>The petition  was  opposed.  The  controversy was submitted for decision upon a stipulation  of  facts,  in view  of which the Hon. Wenceslao M. Ortega, Judge,  denied the petition for two reasons:<br><br>(a)  Reinstatement could not be ordered  because the municipal council after investigation had  decreed the petitioner's dismissal from  the service, said council being furthermore no  party to the proceeding; and (b) To question the validity  of the council's actuations, petitioner's remedy was to appeal to the Commissioner of Civil Service, in which case the  special civil action of mandamus became unavailable. <br>In due time petitioner took the matter  directly to this Court. <br><blockquote>"That petitioner was serving  as Chief of  Police of  Labason, Zamboanga del  Norte, since August  16,  1948,  when he took his oath  of office up to June 15, 1956, when  he was  temporarily suspended from the  service  until the final  decision  of the administrative case  filed against him which in  no case  shall it exceed  sixty (60)  days; <br><br>That the period of sixty (60) days from June 15, 1956, had expired on August  13, 1956; <br><br>That petitioner  had been  suspended by reason of the  administrative case filed against  hint before the Municipal Council of Labason and  that, respondent Mayor  Generoso  Tokong refused  to reinstate  petitioner  herein on  the ground  that the said Council found him guilty of the charges filed against him and ordered his dismissal  from the service; * *  * <br><br>That on July 2, 1956,  Municipal Resolution No. 07 was passed, copy  of which is  attached to the petition and  marked as Annex "H"; <br><br>That on July 24, 1956, the Municipal Council of Labason resolved to  reinvestigate  the   administrative case against the petitioner herein and passed Municipal Resolution No". 109; * * * <br><br>That on August 13, 1956, the Municipal Council of Labason proceeded to hear ex-parte the  administrative case against petitioner herein after the latter had walked out when his motion for postponement  was denied;                       <br><br>That the Municipal Council of Labason had  rendered its  decision in  the  administrative case against the petitioner on  August 13, 1956, and  the  petitioner  had filed a notice  of  appeal  from  said decision with  the  Municipal  Mayor  of  Labason on September  3, 1956,  and which  administrative  case is  now on  appeal for the final  resolution by the Commissioner  of Civil  Service." * * *</blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Issues</span>. The arguments in the printed  brief  for the petitioner-appellant  may be reduced  to the following propositions :<br>  <br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="5%"><div align="center">(a)</div></td><td width="90%"> Reinstatement of petitioner was mandatory after the sixty-day suspension, the delay not having been caused by his fault, negligence or petition;</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td><div align="center">(b)</div></td><td> It was unnecessary to include the municipal council as part respondent. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td><div align="center">(c)</div></td><td> The suspension and removal rested on grounds not mentioned by the statute.</td></tr></tbody></table><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Discussion</span>.  I.  The first  proposition invokes  sec.  3 of Republic Act No.  557 providing that: <br><blockquote>"When  charges are filed against  a  member  of  the  provincial guards, city police or municipal  police under this Act, the provincial governor,  city mayor or municipal mayor, as the case may be, may  suspend  the accused, and  said  suspension  to  be  not  longer than  sixty days.  <span style="font-style: italic;">If during the period of sixty days, the  case shall not have been  derided finally, the accused, if he is suspended, shall ipso facto be reinstated in office</span> without prejudice to the continuation of the  case until its  final  decision  unless  the delay  in  the disposition of  the case is due to the fault,  negligence,  or petition of the accused, in which case the period of  the  delay shall  not be counted in  computing  the period of  suspension  herein  provided,"</blockquote>and emphasizes the portion above underlined. <br><br>It  will  be noticed  however,  that on the  sixtieth  day the  council voted by  resolution  to  remove the petitioner from his position.   Such resolution would have decided the matter finally if petitioner has not filed a notice of appeal to the Commissioner of Civil Service. Therefore, his case was not finally disposed  of  <span style="font-style: italic;">because of his own</span> voluntary act of appealing, which amounted to a <span style="font-style: italic;">petition</span> for review. Such petition excused  any delay in the definite disposition of the charges. <br><br>Indeed, it would be contrary to the spirit of mandamus proceedings to compel reinstatement of a suspended  officer after the latter had been found guilty and dropped  from the service by the competent official body.  Such suspended official, it  may  be said, did not have a clear legal  right (to return) enforceable by mandamus.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>And the court's discretion  should not  be  exercised  in a way  injurious to public interest;<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup>  nor  should mandamus  issue where  it would not promote substantial  justice.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</span></sup> <br><br>In  this connection it appears that on October 27,  1957, before the submission  of this appeal for adjudication, the Commissioner of Civil Service decided administratively the appeal of Sergio G. Martinez in the sense that "he is hereby considered resigned effective on  the date  of  his suspension, without prejudice  to reinstatement in the discretion of the appointing official." <br><br>II. In  our view  of the cause, the second  proposition concerning the  non-joinder  of the municipal council,  becomes immaterial.<br><br>III. In his third proposition appellant  says his suspension (and dismissal)  is not warranted, because the charges do not fall under any of the grounds  mentioned by Republic Act No. 557 for administrative action against menbers of the  municipal police force.  Such contention has no merit.  The  negligence  and delay  attributed to him surely constituted "misconduct or incompetency" or "violation of law or duty" within the meaning of sec. 1  of said Act. <br><br>Not for the courts, naturally,  the revision of the evidence  to  determine whether the charges against him had been adequately substantiated.  For the courts rather the legal question  of authority and the observance of due process and procedural requirements. On both points our finding is for respondents.  True, there was at first the error  of  some  councilors signing  the  charges,  and the Council's  mistake of  delegating the investigation to three members  thereof;<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>   but  both  errors  were seasonably corrected, the investigation was re-opened<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup> and conducted by the whole membership;  and  the Council's  decree  of removal issued within the sixty-day period  prescribed  by the statute. <br><br>By the  way, the Civil Service Commission wherein any irregularities could  have been properly and  fully aired, approved  the decree of separation  upon a review  of the record of the administrative inquiry. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Conclusion</span>. Taking the  matter as a whole, we  think petitioner exhibited  no clear legal  right  to reoccupy his post.  His Honor did not err in declining  to issue a mandatory writ. Judgment  affirmed, with costs against  appellant. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,  Concepcion,  Reyes,  J. B.
