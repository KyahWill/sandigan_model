				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The properties involved herein were the alleged conjugal properties of the late&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; Simon Toledo&nbsp; and Andrea Nocon.&nbsp; The husband predeceased the wife and after the latter's&nbsp; death on July&nbsp; 19, 1955, testamentary proceedings were instituted on August 5, 1955, in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Cavito&nbsp; (Special Proceedings No. 5743), wherein&nbsp; petitioner Cirila Nocon was appointed&nbsp; administratrix thereof.&nbsp; The wills of Andrea Nocon and&nbsp; the order probating the same&nbsp; appear&nbsp; on record as Annexes A,&nbsp; A-1 and B. <br><br>While said testamentary proceedings were&nbsp; pending,&nbsp; as they are still pending, or specifically&nbsp; in September,&nbsp; 1955, respondent heirs&nbsp; of Celedonia, Jacinta, Silvina,&nbsp; Nicolas and Juan, surnamed Toledo, claiming to be the heirs&nbsp; of the&nbsp; deceased husband Simon Toledo, filed an action against herein petitioner Cirila Nocon&nbsp; as&nbsp; executrix of the estate of Andrea Nocon, deceased wife of the late Simon Toledo, and the spouses Melquiades&nbsp; Grepo and&nbsp; Encarnacion Villanueva,' (Civil Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 5755 of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cavite—Annex C)&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; partition of the&nbsp; alleged conjugal assets of the late spouses Simon Toledo&nbsp; and Andrea Nocon and&nbsp; praying that defendants be&nbsp; ordered&nbsp; to make an&nbsp; inventory and&nbsp; accounting of&nbsp; all the if fruits of the&nbsp; properties beginning with&nbsp; the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 1950&nbsp; and to deliver to the plaintiffs not only the&nbsp; shares&nbsp; corresponding&nbsp; to them&nbsp; from all the&nbsp; lands described in the Hi&nbsp; last will of Andrea Nocon (Annex A), but also the corresponding&nbsp; fruits,&nbsp; with&nbsp; interests&nbsp; from&nbsp; date&nbsp; they&nbsp; were&nbsp; gathered, and to reimburse the plaintiffs for their&nbsp; actual expenses (of litigation and attorney's fees) equivalent&nbsp; to 1/3 of the share corresponding to them, plus moral, nominal, moderate and&nbsp; exemplary damages in an amount not less* than P5,000.00, plus&nbsp; any other&nbsp; lawful, just and equitable relief to which they may be&nbsp; entitled in the premises. The defendant spouses were sued in said&nbsp; case&nbsp; No. 5755 because&nbsp; the&nbsp; late&nbsp; Andrea&nbsp; Nocon, without&nbsp; the&nbsp; knowledge and consent&nbsp; of plaintiff heirs of the aforementioned Toledos, sold on November 28, 1954, to said spouses&nbsp; lot No. 2285 mentioned in&nbsp; the will&nbsp; (Annex A). <br><br>Defendant Cirila&nbsp; Nocon and&nbsp; her co-defendant&nbsp; spouses answered that&nbsp; complaint, setting&nbsp; the affirmative defenses that plaintiffs' complaint&nbsp; states&nbsp; no cause&nbsp; of action and that they had another remedy, and a counterclaim in the sum of&nbsp; P3,000.00.&nbsp; In&nbsp; that&nbsp; answer,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; October 21, 1955, defendants&nbsp; denied that the disputed properties were conjugal, emphasizing&nbsp; that&nbsp; they were the&nbsp; exclusive or separate properties&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased wife Andrea&nbsp; Nocon, and further&nbsp; alleging that plaintiff heirs of Simon&nbsp; Toledo had "absolutely no&nbsp; right&nbsp; nor any&nbsp; interest&nbsp; of&nbsp; any kind in the&nbsp; properties listed in Annex&nbsp; A of the&nbsp; complaint." <br><br>On June 30,&nbsp; 1956, defendant Cirila Nocon, as the duly appointed and qualified executrix of the testate' estate of the late Andrea&nbsp; Nocon,&nbsp; filed a motion to dismiss&nbsp; (Annex D), alleging&nbsp; in substance (1) that the&nbsp; properties inventoried in&nbsp; said testate proceedings as constituting the&nbsp; estate of the late Andrea Nocon are the very&nbsp; same properties which the herein nameless plaintiffs desire to partition&nbsp; in said' case 5755; and (2) that under&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 31.76 amending Section 685&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Civil Procedure&nbsp; and&nbsp; Section 2, Rule 75,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; the conjugal partnership should be liquidated either in&nbsp; an ordinary partition action&nbsp; or in&nbsp; the corresponding administration proceeding for the settlement of the estate&nbsp; of either spouse, and prayed that the complaint be dismissed.&nbsp; Upon objection&nbsp; of the plaintiffs on the ground (1) that the answer of the defend- ants put in&nbsp; issue&nbsp; the&nbsp; question of title of&nbsp; the properties mentioned in the will (Annex A) ; and (2)&nbsp; that when the question of title to property&nbsp; is raised the same should be&nbsp; determined&nbsp; in an&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; action&nbsp; and&nbsp; not&nbsp; in probate proceedings, and this whether or not the property is alleged to belong to the estate (Ongsiako, et al. vs. Tan, et al.,&nbsp; 97 Phil., 330; Santiago vs.&nbsp; CFI of Rizal, 55 Phil. 62; and Devesa vs. Arties, 13 Phil. 273,&nbsp; and other&nbsp; case), the Court, by order of July&nbsp; 14, 1956, overruled the motion to dismiss for not being well founded.&nbsp; The motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; order&nbsp; (Annex&nbsp; E)&nbsp; was&nbsp; also denied. <br><br>Because of these two orders and claiming that the trial Judge&nbsp; acted without or in excess of jurisdiction and with grave&nbsp; abuse of discretion&nbsp; in&nbsp; not dismissing the partition suit filed by respondents Toledo in Civil Case No. 5755; that his order denying petitioner's&nbsp; motion to dismiss is contrary to settled rulings of this Court; that&nbsp; respondent Judge&nbsp; had no&nbsp; jurisdiction to entertain&nbsp; the partition suit while the said testamentary proceedings for the settlement of&nbsp; the wife's&nbsp; estate are pending;&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; can be&nbsp; no partition&nbsp; in a separate action such&nbsp; as in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 5755 because what can be partitioned only is the <i>remmiente liquido</i>, and this net remainder can only be determined in the testamentary proceedings; that partition and liquidation of the supposed conjugal partnership are required&nbsp; by law to be effected in the testamentary&nbsp; proceedings; and that the trial&nbsp; Court acted in a manner which is&nbsp; not&nbsp; in accord with the&nbsp; applicable decisions of&nbsp; this Court, when it did&nbsp; not dismiss the separate action for&nbsp; partition, and further claiming that&nbsp; she&nbsp; has no adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law, the petitioner executrix prays&nbsp; that the orders&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent. Judge denying petitioner's motion to&nbsp; dismiss in Civil Case No. 5755&nbsp; of the Cavite Court of First Instance be ^et&nbsp; aside&nbsp; with costs against respondent&nbsp; heirs&nbsp; of' said&nbsp; Toledos.<br><br>Considering the foregoing&nbsp; narration of facts and without going into the merits of the main, issue of these proceedings, it seems evident that&nbsp; petitioneir's&nbsp; present recourse of certiorari does not&nbsp; lie.<br><br>Rule 67 of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court provides: <br><blockquote>"Section&nbsp; 1. <i>Petition for cerliorari.</i>—When any tribunal,&nbsp; board, or officer exercising&nbsp; judicial functions,&nbsp; has&nbsp; acted without&nbsp; or&nbsp; in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave&nbsp; abuse of discretion and* there is no appeal, nor any plain,&nbsp; speedy and adequate remedy in the&nbsp; ordinary course of laiv,&nbsp; a person&nbsp; aggrieved&nbsp; thereby may file&nbsp; a verified&nbsp; petition in the proper court alleging the facts with certainty and praying that&nbsp; judgment be rendered&nbsp; annulling&nbsp; or modifying the proceedings of such&nbsp; tribunal, board,&nbsp; or&nbsp; officer,&nbsp; as the&nbsp; law requires,&nbsp; with costs."</blockquote>So that where&nbsp; an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; is in&nbsp; itself&nbsp; a sufficient and adequate remedy&nbsp; that&nbsp; would promptly relieve&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; from the&nbsp; injurious&nbsp; effects of the order&nbsp; or&nbsp; judgment complained of,&nbsp; the existence of that appeal would bar&nbsp; the institution of the&nbsp; remedy of certiorari.&nbsp; In the case at&nbsp; bar, if&nbsp; executrix Cirila Nocon, defendant in said Civil Case No.&nbsp; 5755, was not agreeable&nbsp; to the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the Court&nbsp; refusing to&nbsp; dismiss the complaint filed against her&nbsp; and the spouses&nbsp; Grepo, she should&nbsp; have submitted herself for trial and&nbsp; let the&nbsp; lower Court render decision in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; and then&nbsp; appeal therefrom if she&nbsp; were not satisfied with the outcome of the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case the lower&nbsp; Court&nbsp; had&nbsp; jurisdiction to&nbsp; pass upon&nbsp; and decide the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; by&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; herself, and where there is jurisdiction over the subject matter, the decision&nbsp; or&nbsp; order&nbsp; on all other questions arising in the case is but an&nbsp; exercise of&nbsp; that jurisdiction (Herrera vs. Barretto et al., 25 Phil. 245, 251), and errors which the court may commit in&nbsp; the exercise of such jurisdiction are merely&nbsp; errors of judgment.&nbsp; Consequently, it is&nbsp; necessary to distinguish errors of&nbsp; jurisdiction from errors of&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first may be reviewed in a&nbsp; certiorari proceed- ing&nbsp; (Henderson vs. Tan,&nbsp; 87 Phil.,&nbsp; 466)&nbsp; the&nbsp; second,&nbsp; by appeal&nbsp; (So&nbsp; Chu&nbsp; et al., vs.&nbsp; Nepomuceno,. 29&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 208; De&nbsp; los&nbsp; Santos vs.&nbsp; Mapa, 46&nbsp; Phil. 791; Santos vs. Court of First Instance, 49 Phil. 398;&nbsp; Ello vs. Judge&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Antique,- 49 Phil.&nbsp; 152;&nbsp; Gonzales vs. Salas, 49 Phil. 1; Ong Sit vs. Piccio, 78 Phil., 785, 44 Off.

Gaz.&nbsp; (Supp.&nbsp; to No.&nbsp; 9),&nbsp; 411, 88 Phil. 260. <br><blockquote>"Unless&nbsp; the abuse of&nbsp; discretion is&nbsp; grave, certiorari will not lie to correct&nbsp; an order denying a motion to&nbsp; dismiss.&nbsp; The reason for the rule is obvious.&nbsp; If&nbsp; every error&nbsp; committed by the trial court&nbsp; were to be&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject&nbsp; of review by certiorari, trials&nbsp; would be&nbsp; interminable.&nbsp; <i>The contention that an order&nbsp; denying&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion to&nbsp; dismiss is&nbsp; merely interlocutory and hence not&nbsp; appealable&nbsp; is without' merit since Section 2 of Rule 41, Rules of Court, does not prohibit an&nbsp; appeal&nbsp; but&nbsp; merely postpones&nbsp; it until after&nbsp; final&nbsp; judgment is rendered, in&nbsp; the,&nbsp; case,</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Arvisu&nbsp; vs. Vergara, 90 Phil., 621).<br><br>"The petition for certiorari&nbsp; with preliminary&nbsp; injunction filed in G.&nbsp; E.&nbsp; No. L-7882, Julia&nbsp; Fortus vs.&nbsp; the&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; Juan Enriquez, etc., et al., is dismissed.&nbsp; <i>The remedy is appeal&nbsp; after the decision on&nbsp; the&nbsp; merits</i>."&nbsp; Resolution&nbsp; of June&nbsp; 25, 1954.)</blockquote> We&nbsp; have already held&nbsp; that neither certiorari&nbsp; nor pro- hibition&nbsp; lies&nbsp; against&nbsp; an order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court granting&nbsp; or denying a motion to&nbsp; quash an information (and the same thing can be said of a motion to dismiss a civil complaint). If the courts&nbsp; had jurisdiction to take&nbsp; cognizance of&nbsp; the case to&nbsp;&nbsp; decide the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; quash&nbsp; or&nbsp; dismiss,&nbsp; appeal in due time is the obvious and only remedy for&nbsp; the parties affected therein (Arches to&nbsp; Beldia et al., G. R., No. L-2414, promulgated on May&nbsp; 27, 1949). <br><br>Wherefore, the&nbsp; petition filed herein&nbsp; is&nbsp; dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered. <br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
