				<H3>IN THE  MATTER  OF THE PETITION FOR  NATURALIZATION OF  SY CHHUT ALIAS  TAN BIN TIONG, PETITIONER AND APPELLANT VS.  REPUBLIC  OF THE  PHILIPPINES,  OPPOSITOR  AND APPELLEE.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner Sy  Chhut  <span style="font-style: italic;">alias</span> Tan  Bin  Tiong seeks a review  of an order  of the Court  of First  Instance  of  Manila denying"  his petition  for naturalization as  citizen  of the Philippines. <br><br>It appears that in his declaration of intention to  become such citizen, appellant stated that he had not been convicted of any crime and  that, in paragraph  13 of  his petition for naturalization,  appellant alleged that he had conducted himself "in a proper  and irreproachable  manner", during the entire  period  of his  residence in  the Philippines, in his relations with the constituted government.  However, the  record shows that  petitioner had ordered the construction  of  a two  story building, in  the City of Manila, without securing the building permit  required by a municipal  ordinance,  for  which reason  he was charged criminally with a violation thereof, convicted therefor,  and sentenced  to  pay a fine of P20, which was paid on August 21, 1951.  Hence, he made  in  the declaration of intention and the petition for naturalization, both of which  are sworn to, false statements on material matters.  Apart from thus indicating that appellant's conduct  has not been irreproachable,  the  foregoing reflects against his moral character. <br><br>Appellant would have  us  believe now that said  false statements were unintentional, for he was  unaware of his prosecution and conviction, and  of the  fine imposed upon him,  and that  the same was paid, without his knowledge or consent,  by Inocencio Tan, a building  contractor who undertook the  construction  of said  building, according to a motion  for new trial filed  by appellant and  the affidavit of said Inocencio Tan, attached to  said motion, which was denied by the lower court.  Appellant's  brief  shows, however, that Inocencio Tan was not  a  building contractor. Besides,  being  the defendant in said criminal case, appellant is presumed to have been served with  the corresponding notice,  and, on the witness stand,  he did  not deny receipt thereof.  Again,  appellant  admitted  on  the witness stand his  prosecution and conviction,  but he testified that  the  fine  imposed  was  P10 only.   This is another circumstance that reflects his lack of  veracity  and poor moral character. <br><br>Apart from this,  appellant's petition  does not comply with  section 7 of our Revised Naturalization Law, which provides that: <br><blockquote>"* * * The  petition must be filed by the applicant  in his own hand writing and be  supported by affidavit of at least two credible persons, stating: that  they are citizens of the Philippines and personally know the petitioner to be a resident of the Philippines for a  period of time required  by this Act and a person of good repute and morally irreproachable * * *" </blockquote>The period of residence required for appellant herein is ten (10)  years  (section  2,  Commonwealth  Act  No. 473).   Yet,  the  affidavit  of witness Arcebal, attached to appellant's application,  states that the former had known the latter since 1946, or less than ten  (10)  years prior to February 13, 1954, when said petition was filed.  Hence, said petition is fatally defective.   (Robert Cu <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Republic,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G. R. No. L-3018, July 18, 1951, and Awad <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Republic,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> G. R. No. L-7685, September 23, 1955.)  It is  true, that,  testifying  for appellant herein, Arcebal  said  that the year 1946 must have  been written in his  affidavit due to a "clerical or typographical" mistake.  But, regardless of the veracity of this explanation, the law  requires that the petition  for  naturalization be supported "by  affidavit of at least two credible persons,  <span style="font-style: italic;">stating that they </span>*  * * <span style="font-style: italic;">personally know  the petitioner</span> to be a  resident of the Philippines for <span style="font-style: italic;">a period of  time required</span>  by this Act * * *." (Sec. 7.)   This  requirement has not been fulfilled. <br><br>Lastly,  appellant testified that his daughter Marcela  Sy is enrolled in the  Chiang Kai  Shek High School, and his children Manuel Sy  and  Juanita  Sy are studying in the Chinese Republic School.  There is no  evidence that these private schools are  recognized  by  our Government and that Philippine history,  government and civics are taught therein as part of the curriculum.  Hence, compliance with section 2, paragraph 6, of the Revised Naturalization  Law has not been established. <br><br>Wherefore, the order appealed from is hereby affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.   It is so ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor,  Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Reyes, J. B.
