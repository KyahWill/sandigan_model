				<BR><BR><div align="justify">.This is an action brought&nbsp; before the Court of First Instance of La Union to compel defendants to execute in favor&nbsp; of plaintiffs&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessary deed of&nbsp; conveyance of a parcel of land in accordance with the stipulation' agreed upon and to pay damages&nbsp; in the amount of P5,000. Defendants, in&nbsp; their&nbsp; answer,&nbsp; set up as a defense&nbsp; that, the&nbsp; agreement on&nbsp; which&nbsp; plaintiffs base&nbsp; their cause of action is null and void and that the amounts claimed by the&nbsp; plaintiffs represent&nbsp; usurious interests and by&nbsp; way of counterclaim,&nbsp; they asked that plaintiffs be ordered&nbsp; to pay P5,000 as damages and to return the palay and amounts unduly paid by them to said plaintiffs as partial payment of the principal&nbsp; obligation.&nbsp; Plaintiffs&nbsp; submitted a reply traversing the special&nbsp; defenses&nbsp; and&nbsp; counterclaim&nbsp; set up by defendants in their&nbsp; answer.<br><br>On December 1, 1954, plaintiffs and defendants, through their counsel, submitted to the court a stipulation of facts wherein they agreed to submit as evidence the pleadings they have respectively&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; with their corresponding&nbsp; exhibits and&nbsp; prayed that judgment be rendered on the pleadings and, on the strength of this stipulation, the court&nbsp; rendered decision holding, that&nbsp; the agreement on Which plaintiffs predicated their right to a conveyance of the land in question is&nbsp; null and void&nbsp; it containing&nbsp; a covenant which is known in law as <span style="font-style: italic;">pactum&nbsp; commissorium</span> and as such is contrary to&nbsp; law, morals&nbsp; and public policy.&nbsp; As a consequence,&nbsp; the court dismissed&nbsp; the case with&nbsp; costs against the&nbsp; plaintiffs,&nbsp; "without prejudice to their&nbsp; right to proceed to&nbsp; collect their&nbsp; claim&nbsp; as ordinary mortgage creditors&nbsp; under the provisions of section&nbsp; 7, Rule 87, of the Rules of Court."&nbsp; From this Decision,&nbsp; plaintiffs interposed the present appeal.<br><br>The agreement on which the action of the plaintiffs is predicated contains the following covenant:<br><blockquote>"That the conditions of&nbsp; this mortgage&nbsp; are that if&nbsp; I Eduvigis Hernandez&nbsp; or any heirs cannot redeem this mortgage in the same amount plus twelve&nbsp; (12%) per cent per annum interest, th this considered&nbsp; as full payment of this parcel&nbsp; of land without further action in Court, within two&nbsp; (2) years from that date of the contract."<br></blockquote>Interpreting the above covenant, the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; concluded that it&nbsp; embodies a <span style="font-style: italic;">pactum&nbsp; commissorium</span>&nbsp; for the reason that it&nbsp; stipulates that in case the mortgagor&nbsp; fails to redeem the mortgage within the&nbsp; period&nbsp; agreed upon, the consideration of the mortgage&nbsp; shall be considered as payment&nbsp; of the land which thereby becomes the property of the mortgagee.&nbsp; To this we agree.&nbsp; This is the&nbsp; only interpretation that can&nbsp; be given to the terms of the covenant&nbsp; especially the phrase&nbsp; that&nbsp; the money&nbsp; taken "shall be considered as full payment of this parcel of&nbsp; land without "further action in court."'&nbsp; This means that upon failure or redemption, the land automatically passes to the mortgagee.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what is&nbsp; condemned by&nbsp; Articles 1859 and 1884 of the&nbsp; old Civil&nbsp; Code, as has&nbsp; been interpreted by this Court in a number of cases.&nbsp; Thus, in Tan Chun Tic <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. West Coast Life Insurance Co.&nbsp; and Locsin, 54 Phil. 361,&nbsp; this Court said:&nbsp; "The stipulation in the mortgage that&nbsp; the land covered&nbsp; thereby shall become&nbsp; the property of the mortgagee upon failure to pay the debt within the period&nbsp; agreed upon, constitutes a <span style="font-style: italic;">pactum&nbsp; commissorium</span>, and is therefore&nbsp; null&nbsp; and void."&nbsp; And in a recent case wherein in one of the documents involved it was stipulated that upon failure of a party to exercise his right to redeem title&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; land "shall&nbsp; pass to and become vested absolutely, in the party of the second part", this Court hinted&nbsp; ; that&nbsp; if&nbsp; that&nbsp; clause would be construed&nbsp; as&nbsp; giving&nbsp; the mortgagee the right to own&nbsp; the property&nbsp; upon failure of the mortgagor to pay the&nbsp; loan, it would&nbsp; be a <span style="font-style: italic;">pactum commissorium</span> which is unlawful and void (Pedro Guerrero <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Serapion de Ynigo, 96 Phil., 37).<br><br>Appellants, however, try to differentiate the present case from the ones above cited by laying stress on the particular&nbsp; circumstance&nbsp; that in&nbsp; said&nbsp; cases&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgagor authorized the mortgagee to take over' the property and dispose&nbsp; of it upon&nbsp; failure to pay&nbsp; the debt&nbsp; within&nbsp; the period agreed upon, whereas in the present&nbsp; case there is no such authority no implication in the terms of the covenant in question.&nbsp; This&nbsp; claim&nbsp; is untenable for said covenant clearly stipulates that upon failure to redeem the mortgage&nbsp; the transaction shall automatically become&nbsp; one of sale "without&nbsp; further action&nbsp; in Court."&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a typical case&nbsp; of a <span style="font-style: italic;">pactum commissorium.</span><br><br>The cases&nbsp; of Dalay <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Aquiatin and Maximo, 47 Phil., 951 and Kasilag <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rodriguez, 69 Phil.,&nbsp; 217 invoked by appellants are not applicable because the&nbsp; terms of the covenant therein involved were couched&nbsp; in&nbsp; a manner different from those&nbsp; of the present covenant.&nbsp; In the&nbsp; first&nbsp; case, the parties&nbsp; stipulated&nbsp; that if&nbsp; the debtor&nbsp; cannot pay the debt when the date agreed upon comes, "the&nbsp; same shall be paid with the lands given as security" and this Court held that such&nbsp; stipulation does not&nbsp; violate&nbsp; the law&nbsp; (Article 1859&nbsp; of the&nbsp; old&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code) because&nbsp; it&nbsp; "does&nbsp; not&nbsp; authorize&nbsp; the creditor to appropriate&nbsp; the property pledged or mortgaged, nor to dispose&nbsp; thereof, and constitutes only a&nbsp; promise&nbsp; to&nbsp; assign,&nbsp; said property in&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the obligation&nbsp; if upon its maturity, it is not paid."&nbsp; And in the second cases the agreement "was&nbsp; that if&nbsp; the mortgagor shall fail to redeem&nbsp; the mortgage "she&nbsp; would execute a deed of absolute&nbsp; sale of the property"&nbsp; in favor of&nbsp; the mortgagee which&nbsp; does not give&nbsp; automatic ownership&nbsp; to the latter but rather constitutes a mere promise of assignment of the,&nbsp; property&nbsp; for which&nbsp; reason the.Court&nbsp; held that the same is&nbsp; valid&nbsp; and&nbsp; legal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently,&nbsp; these two cases cannot be considered as authority for the interpretation of the covenant in question.<br><br>The decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs against appellants. <br><br><i>Par√°s, C.
