				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal&nbsp; from an&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Isabela, sitting&nbsp; as&nbsp; a cadastral&nbsp; court,&nbsp; Hon.&nbsp; Pedro C. Quinto,&nbsp; presiding, in Cad. Case No.&nbsp; 3, G.L.R.O Cad. Rec. 1481 of Isabela, entitled "The Director of Lands, plaintiff, <i>vs.</i> Catalina Balahin, et al., defendants, Eugenia M. Mendoza, purchaser-petitioner, <i>vs.</i> Solomon Abrera and Francisco Abrera,&nbsp; oppositors."<br><br>It appears from the record that Taciana Samante, now deceased, is the registered owner of Lot No. 2187, situated in Gordon,&nbsp; Isabela, for&nbsp; which she&nbsp; held Original&nbsp; Certificate of Title No. 1-3818, issued by the Register of Deeds of Isabela.&nbsp; This land was mortgaged by her to the Agricultural&nbsp; Industrial Bank, to secure payment&nbsp; of a loan. On March 2,&nbsp; 1944, Taciana Samante and her&nbsp; son, Francisco Abrera,&nbsp; sold said land&nbsp; to&nbsp; Eugenia R. Mendoza, executing a deed of sale, Annex A to Complaint&nbsp; (Rec. on Appeal,&nbsp; pp. 6-9).<br><br>On June&nbsp; 28, 1954, Eugenia R. Mendoza&nbsp; filed a petition in court setting forth&nbsp; the above purchase made by her of the land of Taciana&nbsp; Samante, and alleging that she had&nbsp; paid the full&nbsp; amount of the loan secured by the land front the proceeds of said sale;&nbsp; that by reason of such payment the&nbsp; Agricultural Industrial Bank had cancelled the&nbsp; lien and&nbsp; delivered the deed&nbsp; of cancellation, owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title, receipts of&nbsp; payment of taxes, tax&nbsp; declarations,&nbsp; etc. to the&nbsp; petitioner; that said documents were lost when the&nbsp; bus on&nbsp; which petitioner's&nbsp; son was&nbsp; riding, was robbed.&nbsp;&nbsp; She, therefore, prayed that the court declare as lost the original certificate of title covering the land, order issuance of&nbsp; a new one in lieu thereof, and the issuance of a transfer certificate of title&nbsp; in&nbsp; her name.&nbsp;&nbsp; This petition was&nbsp; supported by affidavits.&nbsp;&nbsp; Solomon and Francisco, both surnamed Abrera, sons of the&nbsp; deceased Taciana Samante, filed an&nbsp; opposition, alleging&nbsp; that the deed of sale had been secured by&nbsp; means of fraud, duress and&nbsp; intimidation; that petitioner's rights, if any, have&nbsp; already prescribed because they were not asserted within 10 years.&nbsp; The Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, successor of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Agricultural Industrial&nbsp; Bank, also filed an opposition,&nbsp; alleging lack of knowledge&nbsp; of the sale&nbsp; and transfer&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; to the petitioner and the payment supposedly made by her of the loan.&nbsp;&nbsp; The court, after receiving evidence for&nbsp; both&nbsp; parties,&nbsp; ordered the reconstitution&nbsp; of&nbsp; the original&nbsp; certificate of title in. the name of Samante,&nbsp; with the lien in&nbsp; favor of the Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance Corporation&nbsp; annotated at the back&nbsp; thereof and without prejudice to whatever action the petitioner may institute&nbsp; to cancel&nbsp; the&nbsp; lien, as well as to the rights in the property of the other oppositors, Solomon&nbsp; Abrera and&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; Abrera.&nbsp;&nbsp; The above order&nbsp; was&nbsp; issued on September&nbsp; 17, 1954.<br><br>On July 14, 1955, Eugenia R. Mendoza again filed another petition, wherein she&nbsp; reiterated the existence of the sale in her favor and her&nbsp; desire to have the same registered, and&nbsp; alleged also that the reconstituted original certificate of title was delivered by the&nbsp; Register of Deeds&nbsp; to the Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance Corporation.&nbsp; She prayed that the deed of sale in her favor be registered, that the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation&nbsp; surrender&nbsp; the title, that the Register of Deeds&nbsp; cancel the original certificate of&nbsp; title and&nbsp; issue&nbsp; a transfer certificate of title in her&nbsp; name instead, with the same lien annotated thereon.<br><br>The Abrera&nbsp; brothers filed an amended opposition, claiming&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petition is now&nbsp; barred&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Statute of Limitations,&nbsp; that an ordinary action&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been filed because there is a valid and substantial opposition to said petition, that the case is barred by prior judgment, and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale was&nbsp; made&nbsp; without&nbsp; creditor's consent. The&nbsp; Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; Corporation also filed&nbsp; an opposition, alleging that the action is barred by&nbsp; a previous order and that the sale was made without its consent. On August 31, 1955,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court,&nbsp; after hearing the evidence&nbsp; entered&nbsp; a decree&nbsp; which is as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the&nbsp; Court hereby decrees&nbsp; (a) ordering the heirs of Taciana&nbsp; Samante,&nbsp; Solomon Abrera and&nbsp; Francisco&nbsp; Abrera,&nbsp; to file in Court the corresponding&nbsp; action for the&nbsp; annulment of the aforementioned deed of sale within thirty (30)&nbsp;&nbsp; days from notice hereof, and within the same period file a notice of statement&nbsp; in this&nbsp; expediente&nbsp; that they&nbsp; have actually&nbsp; filed&nbsp; such&nbsp; action; (6) in case they fail to file such action and notice&nbsp; of statement, the Court&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; orders&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Rehabilitation&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; Corporation to surrender to the Register of Deeds of Isabel a the new owner's duplicate of Original Certificate of Title No. 1-3818, and hereby orders the&nbsp; Register of&nbsp; Deeds, upon previous payment of all&nbsp; legal fees,&nbsp; to register the Deed of Sale executed by Taciana Samante, in . favor of the herein petitioner Eugenia R. Mendoza, and&nbsp; to issue in her favor the corresponding Transfer&nbsp; Certificate of Title transcribing at the back thereof the&nbsp; standing mortgage&nbsp; lien in&nbsp; favor of the then&nbsp; Agricultural and Industrial&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rehabilitation Finance Corporation; and&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; the Court hereby&nbsp; reiterates&nbsp; its previous order to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, that, in the event that it accepts payment of the mortgage obligation from the heirs of&nbsp; Taciana Samante, to hold in abeyance the delivery of the owner's duplicate Certificate of Title No.&nbsp; 1-3818, pending the final&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; action for annulment of the deed of sale that may&nbsp; be filed by&nbsp; the heirs of Taciana Samante."&nbsp; (pp. 65-66, Rec. on Appeal).<br></blockquote>Oppositors filed&nbsp; a motion to reconsider the above order, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was denied.&nbsp; Against the order of August 31, 1955, this&nbsp; appeal was prosecuted by oppositors Francisco&nbsp; Abrera&nbsp; and Solomon Abrera.&nbsp; The Rehabilitation Finance Corporation&nbsp; has not appealed.<br><br>In this appeal, it is argued that the petitioner-appellee should have filed an ordinary civil action and not the instant petition,&nbsp; so that the validity of&nbsp; the sale made&nbsp; by their mother could be passed upon by the court); that the court should have denied the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>, taking into account the previous order of said court; that the petition should have been denied because the same has already prescribed.<br><br>On the question of <i>res judicata</i>, we find that appellants' contention is devoid of merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original order precisely reserved&nbsp; to petitioner&nbsp; herein Mendoza&nbsp; the right to file any&nbsp; action that she may have to cancel&nbsp; the&nbsp; lien of the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation and against the oppositors&nbsp; Abrera brothers.&nbsp; The second&nbsp; petition was filed&nbsp; in pursuance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; reservation.<br><br>The opposition&nbsp; to the&nbsp; registration on&nbsp; the&nbsp; ground that the petition was filed beyond the prescriptive&nbsp; period (the deed of sale&nbsp; was&nbsp; executed on&nbsp; March&nbsp; 2, 1944&nbsp; and the petition&nbsp; for registration&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; on June 28,&nbsp; 1954)&nbsp; is also&nbsp; without merit.&nbsp; Under the provisions of&nbsp; Section 112 of the Land Registration Act, no limitation or period&nbsp; is fixed for filing a&nbsp; petition to annotate a&nbsp; deed of sale&nbsp; at the back of a certificate of title.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; any party claims that a person registering a deed of sale can no longer do&nbsp; so, because the deed was executed more than 10 years before, such objection must be raised in an ordinary civil action, for a cadastral court lacks jurisdiction to consider whether the right to register or annotate a deed of sale has already lapsed.&nbsp; The order appealed from precisely authorizes the oppositors&nbsp; to file the corresponding action to&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; an annulment of the deed of sale.<br><br>It is also argued&nbsp; on behalf of&nbsp; the appellants that petitioner should have&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an ordinary civil action, not a mere petition to cancel the original certificate of title and to issue a transfer certificate of title.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither can&nbsp; we find merit in this contention.&nbsp; The&nbsp; opposition presented by the Abrera brothers did not question the existence and validity of the deed of&nbsp; sale;&nbsp; no allegation was made or proofs submitted&nbsp; during the trial as to&nbsp; the existence of fraud,&nbsp; duress or&nbsp; intimidation.&nbsp; The regisiiration of the sale and the issuance of a transfer certificate of&nbsp; title are ministerial duties of the Register of Deeds which the Court of First Instance, sitting as a cadastral court, could order.&nbsp; The registration requested is in accordance with the express provisions&nbsp; of Sections 111 and 112&nbsp; of Act 496, because there is no question as to the existence and validity of the said deed of sale (Enriquez <i>vs.</i> Atienza,&nbsp; 100 Phil., 1072; Casilan <i>vs.</i> Espartero, 95 Phil., 799; 50 Off. Gaz., (9) 4183; Lagula <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Casimiro, 98&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 102; 52 Off. Gaz., 196).<br><br>For the same reasons stated above, the claim made&nbsp; by the oppositors against the sale,&nbsp; i.e., that it&nbsp; was tainted with fraud&nbsp; and duress, can also&nbsp; be&nbsp; ventilated only in&nbsp; an ordinary civil action in an ordinary court and not before a cadastral court.&nbsp; There was, therefore,&nbsp; no error on the part of&nbsp; the court&nbsp; in ordering&nbsp; oppositors-appellants to file the action&nbsp; to&nbsp; annul&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale within&nbsp; 30 days from receipt of the order.<br><br>Finding no merit in the arguments adduced by appellants against&nbsp; the disputed order,&nbsp; we hereby affirm&nbsp; said order, with costs against appellants.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
