				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">When on December 15, 1956, Silvestre Caparros &amp; Co., a partnership&nbsp; operating the motorboat "Lola Victorina" between Atimonan and&nbsp; Alabat Island, Quezon Province, applied to the Public Service Commission for authority to charge specified passenger&nbsp; and freight rates&nbsp; on its sea route, Brigido Jugueta, Jose Angulo and Jose&nbsp; Olaivar opposed the application.&nbsp; They alleged that they were the grantees of certificates of public convenience to operate a ferry service, with motor launches, in the Atimonan-Alabat line; that they were rendering adequate service; that Silvestre Caparros &amp; Co. had no&nbsp; such certificate and was illegally operating in their given area of activity; and that no need had arisen for another boat to carry passengers and cargo between the two points, etc.<br><br>By&nbsp; order&nbsp; of January&nbsp; 29,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; the Commission provisionally approved the rates thus proposed, and then set the case for hearing on February 28, 1957.&nbsp; On February 23,&nbsp; 1957, this petition for certiorari with&nbsp; preliminary injunction was filed here, alleging grave abuse of discretion and/or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>It is the petitioners' theory that the Public Service Commission&nbsp; erred&nbsp; in not previously requiring Caparros &amp; Co,, to obtain a certificate of public convenience,&nbsp; and in allowing said partnership to make use of its motorboat in disregard of their previously acquired&nbsp; certificates of public convenience.<br><br>After stating that the "Lola Victorina" was duly&nbsp; licensed and permitted by the Bureau of Customs to engage in the&nbsp; bay&nbsp; and&nbsp; river&nbsp; business&nbsp; in the waters of Alabat, Perez&nbsp; and Atimonan,&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; Province, the&nbsp; Commission went on to say in the appealed order,<br><br><blockquote>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; applicant does not seek a certificate for a ferry service but&nbsp; merely approval&nbsp; of rates under&nbsp; Section 13 (b)&nbsp; of the Public Service&nbsp; Act;&nbsp; in other words, for inter-island service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is&nbsp; a&nbsp; boat service&nbsp; from&nbsp; Atimonan&nbsp; to&nbsp; Alabat&nbsp; a&nbsp; ferry or&nbsp; inter-island?&nbsp; In Javellana <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; (G. R.&nbsp; L-9088)&nbsp; the Supreme Court held "that it will&nbsp; be more in consonance with&nbsp; the&nbsp; spirit&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law to consider steamboat or motorboat service between&nbsp; different islands, involving more or less great distances and over more or less turbulent and dangerous waters&nbsp; of the open&nbsp; sea, to&nbsp; be coastwise&nbsp; or inter-island service", and the fact that a&nbsp; definite&nbsp; route is&nbsp; applied for&nbsp; does not&nbsp; make&nbsp; the service&nbsp; a ferry service.&nbsp; We&nbsp; do not see really that a boat service from&nbsp; Atimonan&nbsp; to Alabat,&nbsp; considering the&nbsp; body of water traversed&nbsp; and the distance,&nbsp; can&nbsp; be considered a<span style="font-style: italic;"> ferry service</span> for which&nbsp; a certificate&nbsp; should&nbsp; be required.&nbsp; The body of water between Atimonan and Alabat cannot be considered as a small body of water connecting an interrupted highway, we cannot&nbsp; say either that Atimonan and Alabat are two points&nbsp; on opposite shores of a body of water which does not involve too great of distance or too long a time to navigate.&nbsp; It is actually a crossing from one island&nbsp; to another with a distance of approximately 15 kilometers, and cannot be considered&nbsp; a ferry service but inter-island in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in Javellana <i>vs.</i> Commission, so that applicant's petition for approval of&nbsp; rates under Section 13(6)&nbsp; of the Public Service Act may&nbsp; be entertained."</blockquote><br>The Commission erred, argue the petitioners, in applying and following the Javellana decision, because water transportation between&nbsp; Alabat&nbsp; and Atimonan constitutes <span style="font-style: italic;">ferry service</span>, and not inter-island shipping.&nbsp;&nbsp; They make distinctions between&nbsp; the circumstances of this case and those mentioned in the Javellana decision,—particularly&nbsp; the distance between the terminal points, and the condition of&nbsp; the seas— to reach the conclusion that the Alabat-Atimonan route is not inter-island, but a ferry service for which a&nbsp; certificate of public convenience must first be secured from the Public Service Commission.<br><br>We think the matter depends mostly on the surrounding conditions&nbsp; of the trips,&nbsp; and the&nbsp; Commission's judgment must be accorded preponderant&nbsp; weight.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true, the distance between the two towns is only 14 kilometers whereas the distance in the&nbsp; Javellana decision (Batangas-Calapan)&nbsp; was 44 kilometers.&nbsp; But&nbsp; as respondent's&nbsp; counsel explain,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; decision did not&nbsp; intend to make the circumstances existing in the said route <span style="font-style: italic;">as the absolute minimum&nbsp; necessary</span>&nbsp; to classify a particular water transportation service as inter-island.<br><br>At any rate, in the said Javellana decision we said the Commission had no authority to require steamboats, motorboats or motor vessels plying between the different islands to obtain certificates of public convenience, whether such means of conveyance are used&nbsp; in ferry&nbsp; service or in the inter-island or coastwise trade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Sec. 13 (a) first paragraph of the Public Service Law expressly provides that the Commission&nbsp; "shall have no&nbsp; authority to require steamboats, motorships and steamships lines *&nbsp; * * to&nbsp; obtain certificates of public convenience or to&nbsp; prescribe their definite routes or lines of service".<br><br>To be specific, we hold that in the circumstances, Caparros &amp; Co. needed&nbsp; no previous certificate&nbsp; of public convenience, its "motorboat"&nbsp; being a "motorship".<br><br>Indeed, being of&nbsp; that opinion, we dismissed as without merit, the previous petition of Jugueta&nbsp; (G. R. L-11772) to set aside the&nbsp; order&nbsp; of Judge&nbsp; Vicente del Rosario of Quezon&nbsp; Province,&nbsp; dissolving the&nbsp; preliminary&nbsp; injunction previously issued&nbsp; to prevent Caparros &amp; Co. from operating this motorboat along the Alabat-Atimonan route.&nbsp; The injunction had been issued on the basis&nbsp; of lack of certificate from the&nbsp; Commission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Judge adhering to our Javellana&nbsp; decision, thought&nbsp; such&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; unnecessary, and&nbsp; therefore&nbsp; dissolved&nbsp; the&nbsp; injunction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp; dismissal resolution sustained him: certificate not needed. <br><br>The&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; order&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against petitioners.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Labrador,</i> and <i>Concepcion, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In Brown <i>vs.</i> Sueso, 104 Phil., 388, we held, a motor launch ferrying between coastal towns needed no certificate of public convenience.</div>
