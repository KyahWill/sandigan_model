				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The pertinent facts of this case are not disputed and are as follows: On 
August 11, 1951, the Board of Directors of Bowen &amp; Co., Inc., a duly 
organized domestic corporation, adopted a resolution appointing one of its 
directors, Francisco U. Buenaseda, as Managing Director. In the same resolution, 
said Francisco U. Buenaseda was authorized "to negotiate for and in behalf of 
the corporation with the Government for the securing of the ECA order for paints 
in the sum of $398,000.00", with "full powers to arrange the financing of the 
order and if necessary to mortgage the entire assets of the Corporation." 
Sometime in the same year, after proper representations and negotiations, an 
award of P200,000 worth of ECA procurement materials consisting of marine and 
industrial paints was allocated to the corporation. For the importation of these 
materials, it was necessary to open a letter of credit in the amount of 
P100,000.00 with the Philippine National Bank. As the corporation did not have 
at the time the necessary funds to put up the required cash marginal deposit of 
P60,000.00, its president, Gieoffrey Bowen, obligating the corporation and 
himself in his personal capacity, offered to pay Francisco U. Buenaseda 37<span class="style9">1/2</span> % of the profits to be realized from the sale of the ECA 
procurement materials, should he (Buenaseda) be able to obtain and produce the 
amount necessary to cover the cash marginal deposit. Francisco U. Buenaseda 
accepted the offer ancj through his business connections, another corporation, 
E.J.C. Montilla &amp; Co. agreed to put up the cash marginal deposit of 
P60,000.00. In consideration thereof, a provisional contract of partnership was 
entered into by and between E.J.C. Montilla &amp; Co. and Bowen &amp; Co., Inc. 
The contract, among other things, provides that, besides the return of 
P60,000.00, E.J.C. Montilla &amp; Co. shall receive as compensation an amount 
equivalent to 50% of the total profits that may be realized from the sale of ECA 
procurement materials. To guarantee the faithful performance of the terms and 
conditions of the contract by Bowen &amp; Co., Inc., a lien of second mortgage 
was constituted on certain real property admittedly belonging to Francisco U. 
Buenaseda. The latter under the contract also guarantees in his personal 
capacity, jointly and severally with Bowen &amp; Co., Inc., the faithful 
performance of all the terms and conditions of the contract.
<p>After the required cash marginal deposit of P60,000,00 had been macle, the 
P200,000.00 worth of EGA procurement materials were subsequently imported and 
received by Bowen &amp; Co., Inc. From September 27, 1951 to June 9,1955, part 
of the said materials were sold, the corporation realizing a net profit of 
P22,3O3.98. Of this amount, Francisco U. Buenaseda claimed 37<span class="style9">1/2</span> % or P8,363.99 On the strength of the promise of 
Geoffrey Bowen. As the corporation refused to pay, Francisco U. Buenaseda filed 
the present action in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the 
corporation and/or its president, Geoffrey Bowen, to recover the said amount of 
P8,363.99. The lower court, however, in its decision rendered after trial, 
absolved the defendants from the complaint on the theory that the earnings or 
profits derived from the sale of the imported materials were property of the 
corporation and that the "commitment" made to plaintiff by defendant Bowen was 
not approved by the Board of Directors of the defendant corporation. On appeal 
to the Court of Appeals, the decision was affirmed. Reconsideration of this 
decision having been denied, plaintiff Buenaseda filed the present petition for, 
review contending, among other things, that the Court of Appeals erred in 
holding that the agreement between him and Geoffrey Bowen was not binding upon 
the corporation.</p>
<p>We find this contention to be meritorious. It is not here pretended that the 
Board of Directors of the defendant corporation had no knowledge of the 
agreement between Geoffrey Bowen and plaintiff to the effect that the latter was 
to receive 37<span class="style9">1/2</span> % of the profits to be realized from 
the importation and sale of ECA procurement materials. Indeed, at the time the 
said agreement was made, the Board of Directors of the corporation was composed 
of Geoffrey Bowen himself, his wife, Francisco U. Buenaseda and two others, with 
Bowen and his wife controlling the majority of the stocks of the corporation. 
The Board did not repudiate the agreement entered into by Geoffrey Bowen with 
plaintiff Buenaseda, but, on the contrary, acquiesced and took advantage of the 
benefits afforded by said agreement. Such acts are equivalent to aa implied 
ratification of the agreement by the Board of Directors and binds the 
corporation even without formal resolution passed and recorded. (Zamboanga 
Transportation Co. <em>vs</em>. Bachrach Motors, 52 Phil. 244. See also 3 
Thompson on Corporations, 705- 706 3rd Ed., citing the cases of Pittsburg &amp; 
c. R. Co. <em>vs</em>. Keokuk &amp; C. Bridge Co., 131 U.S. 371, 33 L. ed. 157, 
9 Supp. St. 770; Bennet <em>vs</em>. Millville Imp. Co., 67 N.J.L. 320, 51 Atl. 
706. Likewise see 2 Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations, 52 Ed., pp. 678, 
1114-1119, and the cases cited therein.) </p>
<p>It is argued by the respondents, defendants below, that the profits of the 
corporation form part of its assets and payment of a certain percentage of the 
profits requires a declaration of dividends and/or resolution of the Board of 
Directors. The argument is untenable. Although plaintiff Buenaseda is a 
stockholder of the corporation, he does not, however, claim a share of the 
profits as such stockholder, but under an agreement between him and the 
president of the corporation which has been impliedly ratified by the Board of 
Directors.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing we consider it unnecessary to pass upon the other 
questions raised by the parties.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the 
corporation Bowen &amp; Co., Inc. is hereby ordered to pay the sum of P8,363.99 
to petitioner Francisco U. Buenaseda with legal interest from June 17, 1955, and 
37<span class="style9">1/2</span> % of such other profits as may be realized from 
the sale of the remaining ECA procurement materials. So ordered with costs 
against the respondent corporation.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.B.L., 
Barrera,</em> and <em>Paredes, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Decision reversed.</em></p></div>
