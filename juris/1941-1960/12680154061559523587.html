				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">On 26&nbsp; January,&nbsp; 1955, the plaintiff,&nbsp; a minor&nbsp; assisted by her father&nbsp; Gabriel Reyes for whose appointment as guardian&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> she prayed,&nbsp; filed a complaint dated 7 December&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; to&nbsp; recover moral and exemplary&nbsp; damages&nbsp; for physical injuries inflicted upon her, and slander or defamation uttered against her&nbsp; honor, by the&nbsp; defendant Betty Santos de la Rosa, all committed&nbsp; in a public&nbsp; place and in&nbsp; the presence&nbsp; of many people.&nbsp; The&nbsp; total&nbsp; amount sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be recovered&nbsp; is P45,000.&nbsp; She also prays that&nbsp; the defendants be made to pay attorney's fees and&nbsp; costs.<p>The defendants moved for the dismissal of the complaint on&nbsp; the ground (1) that the&nbsp; complaint does not state&nbsp; a cause of action; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that the complaint is barred by a&nbsp; prior judgment.&nbsp; They&nbsp; contend that&nbsp; in&nbsp; criminal case No. 4473-1, People <em>vs</em>. Betty Santos de la Rosa, for slight physical injuries,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Municipal Court&nbsp; of Pasay&nbsp; City found that the physical injuries suffered&nbsp; by the complainant might have been inflicted upon her by Delfin B. Zaleta; that the complainant did not reserve in said criminal case No. 4473-1 her right to institute a separate civil&nbsp; action; and that in the judgment rendered by the municipal court no amount of damages was&nbsp; awarded&nbsp; for failure&nbsp; of the complainant to prove any.</p><p>On 26 February 1955, the&nbsp; complaint was dismissed by the Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Quezon City.&nbsp;&nbsp; A motion to set aside the order of dismissal and to set the case for hearing on the merits was denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence this appeal. Article '33 of the new Civil Code&nbsp; provides that:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>In cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; defamation, fraud, and physical injuries,&nbsp; a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought&nbsp; by the&nbsp; injured&nbsp; party. Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution, and shall require only a preponderance of evidence.</p></blockquote><p>Under&nbsp; these&nbsp; provisions, independently of&nbsp; the criminal action for defamation and&nbsp; physical&nbsp; injuries, a civil suit for recovery of damages arising therefrom may be brought. The fact that the complainant did&nbsp; not reserve her right to institute a separate&nbsp; civil action for damages&nbsp; does not preclude&nbsp; her&nbsp; from&nbsp; bringing&nbsp; such action.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of the municipal court is limited to P2,000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>failure of the plaintiff to prove the amount of&nbsp; damages she had suffered in the criminal action brought&nbsp; in the municipal court, which she now seeks to recover in this civil&nbsp; action, cannot be&nbsp; deemed a Waiver nor can&nbsp; it operate to bar such recovery.</p><p>In her complaint the plaintiff alleges that early in the morning of 15 of June 1954 she was assaulted, slandered and libeled by the&nbsp; defendant Betty&nbsp; Santos&nbsp; de la Rosa in the presence of many&nbsp; people at the Riviera nightclub, as a result of which&nbsp; she suffered moral&nbsp; and exemplary damages.</p><p>The&nbsp; Municipal&nbsp; Court of Pasay City found the defendant Betty Santos de la Rosa guilty of having hit the plaintiff with a handbag&nbsp; and sentenced&nbsp; her to. pay a&nbsp; fine&nbsp; of&nbsp; P50 (case No.&nbsp; 4473-1).&nbsp;&nbsp; The act of hitting the&nbsp; plaintiff alleged under the&nbsp; first cause of action of&nbsp; the complaint, whether it constitutes physical injuries&nbsp; or&nbsp; slander by deed, is a&nbsp; sufficient cause of action&nbsp; for the&nbsp; recovery of damages under the new Civil Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; The libel or slander uttered by the defendant Betty Santos de la Rosa pleaded under the second&nbsp; cause of action of the complaint was not involved in the criminal case.&nbsp; The trial court should not have dismissed the complaint without affording the plaintiff the opportunity to introduce evidence in support of her claim for damages.</p><p>There is&nbsp; nothing&nbsp; alleged in the complaint which&nbsp; constitute a cause of action against Jaime de&nbsp; la Rosa.&nbsp; The fact that he is the husband of the defendant Betty Santos de la Rosa and was present on the occasion the physical injuries or&nbsp; slander by deed&nbsp; was inflicted&nbsp; upon, and&nbsp; the libel or slander was uttered against, the plaintiff&nbsp; by his wife, does not make him liable for the wrongful acts of his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under&nbsp; the former law his joining as party defendant was necessary because the conjugal property or income might have to answer&nbsp; for the payment of damages should the court find the defendant wife liable to&nbsp; pay for them. Under&nbsp; article 113 of the&nbsp; new Civil Code, however, in an action&nbsp; against the wife upon civil liability&nbsp; arising from a criminal offense the&nbsp; husband need not be joined.</p><p>The&nbsp; orders&nbsp; appealed from,&nbsp; in so far as&nbsp; the defendant Betty Santos de&nbsp; la Rosa&nbsp; is concerned, are set&nbsp; aside and the&nbsp; case&nbsp; remanded to the court from whence it came for further proceedings&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with law.</p><p><em>Paras,&nbsp; C.
