				<BR><BR><div align="justify">When on February 15, 1956, this suit for recovery of money was called  for hearing before the Occidental Negros Court of First  Instance in  Bacolod City, none  appeared for the  plaintiff. <br><br>Having noted that three months before, when  this case came  up on November 9, 1955, the plaintiff had also  failed to show up and the hearing had to be postponed,  His Honor, the trial judge  concluded that plaintiff's repeated absence evinced lack of interest to prosecute  its  claim.  Wherefore, he dismissed the suit immediately. <br><br>Within thirty days after notice  of  the dismissal,  the plaintiff's  attorney  moved  for  reconsideration, explaining that defendant,  through  his brother, had on  February 15, 1956  approached the plaintiff for amicable settlement and had deposited P800  as earnest  of good  faith; that  consequently, plaintiff  and  defendant  had  agreed  to ask  for postponement of the hearing; that  in fact at the hearing defendant's  attorney pleaded  for  continuance,  but was overruled; and  that plaintiff's  actuations stemmed from no  desire  to delay  judicial  proceedings.  Movant prayed that,  at least, the order be amended by making this dismissal  "without prejudice." <br><br>The motion was not  opposed by defendant, who never contradicted the factual allegations therein made.  Nevertheless, it was denied, and the denial gave ground to this the  plaintiff's appeal,  wherein  the question  naturally  is whether the  trial court erred in refusing to amend,  as requested. <br><br>In the  light of generally known opinions of this Court on the matter of postponements, His Honor may be was not to blame. We have emphasized  and upheld the  court's discretion; we have ruled that even  if the adverse party should agree to a postponement, the court is not bound to postpone.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup>  This case had once  been delayed due to  absence  of  Plaintiff's counsel,  so that February  15, 1956 was the second non-appearance of such  counsel,  whom the court  knew resided in  Bacolod City itself.  Considering the  court's policy to expedite disposal  of litigations and prevent the clogging  of their dockets, the  outright dismissal could not be criticized. <br><br>Subsequent disclosures,  however, should  have modified His  Honor's strictly legal attitude.  Efforts at compromise are favored by the law.  In Brandt <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Behn Meyer &amp; Co. 38 Phil.,  355 it  was held that "an action  should  not  be dismissed on a non-suit  for want of prosecution when the delay was  caused by an arrangement between the  parties looking towards  a settlement." <br><br>The New Civil Code  directs the courts to "endeavour to persuade the litigants in a civil case to agree upon some fair  compromise"  (Art. 2029)  and  for  that purpose  a civil action "shall be suspended if willingness to  discuss a possible compromise is expressed by one or both parties" (Art. 2030). <br><br>Reflecting that plaintiff's action had  been pending less than one year, that it was based on written promissory notes the execution of which defendant expressly admitted, that his defense rested not on payment,  but on the allegation that although he signed as maker thereof he was in fact a mere  guarantor, and considering that  defendant's attorney was agreeable to or had moved for continuance, we think it equitable to apply our  view in Torrefiel <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Toriano, 91 Phil., 209 which as summarized says:<br><blockquote>"Where it  did not appear that the motion for  postponement of the trial was  due to  any deliberate  desire on  the part of the plaintiffs  and  intervenor  to  delay  the  proceedings  or that the action was frivolous and as defendants' attorney  had expressly agreed to plaintiffs'  motion (to  postpone), the interests of justice and of the court could have been served with a  dismissal of the case <span style="font-style: italic;">without  prejudice</span>," <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Accordingly, the  appealed order  is  affirmed  with  the modification that the dismissal  will not bar  another action on the same  subject matter. So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J., Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador,   Concepcion, Reyes,  J.  B.
