				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 1, 1945, the plaintiff-appellee, Jose Marquez Lim,
instituted a complaint In the Court of First Instance of Iloilo against
John G. Nelson, J.E. Kelley and David Keith, for the purpose of
recovering a motor, launch or its value P10,000, plus damages in. the
sum of P300 daily from November 20, 1945, it being alleged that the
three defendants illegally seized on November 19, 1946, said motor
launch belonging to the plaintiff. On January 10, 1946, the three
defendants, represented by the provincial fiscal of Iloilo, filed an
amended answer alleging in special defense that the vessel belonged to
the United States Government, that the defendants merely acted as
agents of said Government, and that the United States Government is
therefore the real party in interest. On January 31, 1946, the
plaintiff filed an amended complaint so as to include, as a party
defendant, Vern Boster, then detailed as head of the Military Police
Command in the City of Iloilo, to whom the launch was delivered by the
defendant John G. Nelson in the early part of January, 1946. The vessel
subsequently sank while it was being towed from Iloilo to Manila by
the U.S. naval authorities. On January 17, 1947, the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo rendered a decision the dispositive part of which
reads as follows:<br>
<blockquote>
  <p> "In view of the foregoing, judgment is rendered: (<em>a</em>),
declaring plaintiff Jose Marquez Lim to be the legal owner of the motor
launch 'SEA HAWK' and with exclusive right of possession thereon: (<em>b</em>)
ordering defendants John G. Nelson, J.E. Kelley, David Keith and Vern
Boster to pay the plaintiff jointly and severally the" sum of P10,000
representing the value of the boat., and the further sum of P10,000 as
damages; and (<em>c</em>) ordering defendants to pay the costs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p> After the trial court had denied the motion for new trial filed by
the provincial fiscal of Iloilo and the motion to set aside the
judgment filed by the defendant Vern Boster thru his counsel J.A.
Wolfson, the present appeal was interposed.</p>
<p> At the time the vessel in question was seized, the defendant John
G. Nelson was the commanding officer of the U.S. Naval Section Base,
Navy No. 3959, of the United States Navy in the City of Iloilo; the
defendant J.E. Kelley was an officer in said naval section base; and
the defendant David Keith was the Provost Marshal of the United States
Army Military Police in Iloilo. It is not pretended that said
defendants did not act officially as agents of the United States Navy
in the seizure of the motor launch in question. It is not pretended
also that the defendant Vern Boster had anything to do with said
seizure, having been joined as a party defendant in the amended
complaint in virtue solely of the fact that possession of the launch
was delivered to him when he took command of the Military Police in
Iloilo. Hence It is beyond controversy that the action at bar is
directed against the defendants for having acted as agents of the
United States Government.</p>
<p>The appealed decision, however, ruled that the fact that the
defendants were members of the armed forces of the "United States does
not place them beyond the power and jurisdiction of the civil courts,
and the case of Tan Te <em>vs</em>. Bell, (27 Phil. 354), is cited.</p>
<p>In the case of Pedro Syquia <em>vs</em>. Natividad Almeda Lopez et al., L-1648, decided August 17, 1949, (47 Off. Gaz., 665<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>), we made the following applicable pronouncements:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"We shall concede as correctly did the Court of First Instance, that following the doctrine laid down in the cases of U.S. <em>vs</em>. Lee and U.S. <em>vs</em>. Tindal, <em>supra</em>,
a private citizen claiming title and right of possession of a certain
property may, to recover possession of said property, sue as
individuals, officers and agents of the Government who are said to be
illegally withholding the same from him, tho in doing so, said officers
and agents claim that they are acting for the Government, and the
courts may entertain such a suit altho the Government itself is not
included as a party-defendant. Of course, the Government is not bound
or concluded by the decision. The philosophy of this ruling is that
unless the courts are permitted to take cognizance and to assume
jurisdiction over such a case, a private citizen would be helpless and
without redress and protection of his rights which may have been
invaded by the officers of the Government professing to act in its
name. In such a case the officials or agents asserting rightful
possession must prove and justify their claim before the courts, when
it is made to appear in the suit against them that the title and right
of possession is in the private citizen. However, and this is
important, where the judgment in such a case would result not only in
the recovery of possession of the propety in favor of said citizen but
also is a charge against or financial liability to the Government, then
the suit should be regarded as one against the Government itself, and,
consequently, it cannot prosper or be validly entertained by the courts
except with the consent of said Government. (See case of Land <em>vs</em>. Dollar, 91 Law ed., 1209.)" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as the payment of the sum of P10,000 as the value of the
motor launch in question and of the further sum of P10,000 as damages,
will in fact be a charge against or a financial liability to the
Government of the United States, the present action should be regarded
as one against the United States Government itself which cannot prosper
or be validly entertained by the courts except with the consent of said
Government.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the appealed judgment is hereby set aside and the complaint is dismissed. So ordered, without costs.</p>
<em>Moran, C. J., Ozaeta, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor</em>, and <em>Reyes, JJ</em>., concur.
