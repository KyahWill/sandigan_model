				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On November 30, 1953, Nena Micaller was dismissed by the Scoty's Department Store owned and managed&nbsp; by petitioners&nbsp; herein, from her&nbsp; position as&nbsp; salesgirl.&nbsp; Contending that her&nbsp; dismissal was unjustified, Micaller sued her employers in&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations which, after trial, rendered judgment finding&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; guilty of unfair labor practice and ordering them to reinstate her to&nbsp; her&nbsp; former position and to pay her wages in arrears (Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 135-ULP).&nbsp; This case was appealed to the Supreme Court (G. R. No. L-8116).<p>On March 30, 1955,&nbsp; Nena&nbsp; Micaller obtained a writ of execution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment&nbsp; which orders her reinstatement,&nbsp; but&nbsp; petitioners&nbsp; instead&nbsp; of giving her back her former position as salesgirl, set her to work as canvasser of&nbsp; prices outside&nbsp; of the store.&nbsp; On the&nbsp; same date, March 30,&nbsp; 1955, petitioner tendered to&nbsp; Nena Micaller&nbsp; a check in the amount of&nbsp; P124.80 corresponding to her salary for one month,&nbsp; and advised her in writing that&nbsp; her employment was terminated pursuant to the&nbsp; provisions of Republic Act No. 1052.</p><p>Without losing time, Nena Micaller filed a petition with the Court of Industrial Relations in the same case praying that the manager Yu Ki Lam be declared in contempt of&nbsp; court and,&nbsp; after due hearing, the court,&nbsp; in&nbsp; an order entered on&nbsp; May 10, 1955, while declining to punish him for contempt,&nbsp; ordered him&nbsp; "to&nbsp; readmit Nena&nbsp; Micaller to&nbsp; her. former employment under the same&nbsp; conditions of&nbsp; employment existing&nbsp; before the dispute&nbsp; arose; and if he fails&nbsp; to&nbsp; do&nbsp; so, he will be&nbsp; committed to jail&nbsp; until&nbsp; he&nbsp; complies with this order, upon proper motion."&nbsp; After their motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; was denied, petitioners appealed to this Court by&nbsp; way of certiorari disputing the validity of the aforesaid order of the&nbsp; Court of Industrial&nbsp; Relations. </p><p>The questions for determination is whether an employee, who has&nbsp; been dismissed by&nbsp; an&nbsp; employer and&nbsp; who has&nbsp; been ordered&nbsp; reinstated pursuant&nbsp; to a&nbsp; judgment finding in guilty&nbsp; of unfair labor&nbsp; practice, can again be dismissed&nbsp; under the&nbsp; provisions of Republic Act No. 1052.</p><p>Section 1 of.said Act provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Sec. 1. In cases of employment, without a definite&nbsp; period, in&nbsp; a commercial, industrial, or agricultural&nbsp; establishment or enterprise, neither the employer nor the employee shall terminate the employment without serving notice on the order at&nbsp; least one month in advance.&nbsp; </p><p>"The employee, upon whom no such notice was&nbsp; served, shall be entitled to one month's compensation from the&nbsp; date of termination of his employment."</p></blockquote><p>Does the above&nbsp; provision apply to the&nbsp; present&nbsp; case? Commenting on the applicability&nbsp; of said law to&nbsp; the case at bar, the industrial court said:&nbsp; "It&nbsp; is the&nbsp; unanimous opinion, among the members of the Supreme Court, that Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1052&nbsp; authorizes the&nbsp; employer,&nbsp; under some conditions, to terminate relationship&nbsp; with his employee, <span style="font-style: italic;">when the dismissal is not&nbsp; prohibited by law.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; But, when the employee is dismissed because of Union activities, like the case of Nena Micaller, or in&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of express statutory provisions, the employer&nbsp; cannot take refuge in Republic Act No. 1052&nbsp; to justify or&nbsp; legitimate such dismissal."</p><p>We agree to this&nbsp; point&nbsp; of view. While Republic Act No. 1052 authorizes a commercial establishment to terminate the employment of its employee by&nbsp; serving notice on him one month in advance,&nbsp; or, in the absence&nbsp; thereof, by paying him one month compensation from the&nbsp; date of the termination of his employment, such Act does&nbsp; not give to the employer a blanket authority to terminate, the employment&nbsp; regardless of&nbsp; the cause or purpose behind&nbsp; such termination Certainly,&nbsp; it cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; made use of&nbsp; as&nbsp; a cloak&nbsp; to circumvent a&nbsp; final&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the court or&nbsp; as&nbsp; a scheme to trample&nbsp; upon the right of&nbsp; an&nbsp; employee who has been&nbsp; the victim&nbsp; of an unfair&nbsp; labor&nbsp; practice.&nbsp; In other words, the privilege given by that Act to an employer cannot be&nbsp; resorted&nbsp; to&nbsp; if&nbsp; to do so&nbsp; would infringe the law that Congress had enacted to protect labor as against the&nbsp; abuses of&nbsp; capital.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of&nbsp; such abuses&nbsp; which&nbsp; our law condemns&nbsp; and&nbsp; which has given&nbsp; rise&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; many social problems which mark the relationship of labor and capital&nbsp; is&nbsp; unfair labor&nbsp; practice,&nbsp; and this is&nbsp; the act of which said petitioners&nbsp; were condemned.&nbsp; To&nbsp; allow&nbsp; them&nbsp; to&nbsp; take refuge under&nbsp; that Act&nbsp; and obtain by&nbsp; indirect action&nbsp; what they had&nbsp; been expressly enjoined&nbsp; by&nbsp; an express order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court would&nbsp; be&nbsp; a mockery of law and a travesty of justice.&nbsp; Such&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; the intent of Congress.&nbsp; This is in keeping with the social policy that "The relations between&nbsp; capital&nbsp; and labor&nbsp; are&nbsp; not merely contractual.&nbsp; They are&nbsp; so impressed with public&nbsp; interest that&nbsp; labor contracts must yield&nbsp; to the&nbsp; common good' (Article 1700, New Civil Code).</p><p>The behavior observed by petitioners in connection with the reinstatement of Nena Micaller, far from being within the purview of said&nbsp; Act, is contemptuous.&nbsp; On March 30, 1955, the court decreed that she&nbsp; be&nbsp; reinstated, but she was not.&nbsp; As the industrial court found, "She was told that she could not&nbsp; come inside the store, and she was ordered to work&nbsp; outside, to canvass for prices of articles and to&nbsp; report&nbsp; to the management&nbsp; in&nbsp; the evening after everybody was out of the store.&nbsp; Micaller tried to comply with&nbsp; that instruction, but at the&nbsp; close of business, hours of that&nbsp; same date, March 30, she was again dismissed", invoking the provisions&nbsp; of Republic Act No-1052.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is for this reason that the court warned manager. Yu&nbsp; Ki Lam that if&nbsp; he should&nbsp; fail to reinstate her immediately, he will&nbsp; be committed to jail until&nbsp; he&nbsp; complies with the order.&nbsp; We find this injunction&nbsp; justified.</p><p>Wherefore, petition is denied, with costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; petitioners.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,&nbsp; Reyes, J.

For this reason,&nbsp; I believe&nbsp; and&nbsp; I am sure that majority will agree with me that, for the sake of clarity, and to avoid&nbsp; misunderstanding, we&nbsp; should state for the benefit and information of labor and management, that when an employee is improperly dismissed because say, of union activity&nbsp; and affiliation, constituting unfair labor practice, he must be reinstated, even with back pay; But that such reinstatement does not give him a&nbsp; permanent and vested claim&nbsp; to the employment&nbsp; because later&nbsp; if&nbsp; through&nbsp; his Inefficiency or because his services&nbsp; are no longer&nbsp; needed, he&nbsp; may&nbsp; properly and validly be dismissed m accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 1052,, unless said dismissal is made again due&nbsp; to union affiliation or activities.</p><p><em>Padilla, J., </em>concurs.</p></div>
