				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal&nbsp; under Rule 43 from a decision of the Securities and Exchange Commissioner,&nbsp; denying the right of, a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>, to extend its corporate existence by amendment of its original articles of association, or alternatively, to reform and continue existing under the Corporation Law (Act 1459) beyond the original period.<br><br>The&nbsp; petitioner,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Benguet Consolidated&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Co. (hereafter termed "Benguet"&nbsp; for short), was organized on June 24, 1903, as a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span> regulated by Articles 151 et seq, of the Spanish&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Commerce of 1886, then in force in the Philippines.&nbsp; The articles of association expressly provided that&nbsp; it was organized for&nbsp; a term of fifty&nbsp; (50)&nbsp; years.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1906, the governing&nbsp; Philippine Commission enacted Act 1469, commonly known&nbsp; as the Corporation Law, establishing in the islands the American type of juridical entities known&nbsp; as corporation, to&nbsp; take effect on April 1, 1906.&nbsp; of its enactment,&nbsp; this Court said in its decision in Harden <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Benguet Consolidated&nbsp; Mining Co., 58&nbsp; Phil., 141, at&nbsp; pp. 145-146, and 147:<br><blockquote>"When the Philippine Islands passed to the sovereignty of&nbsp; the United States, the attention of the Philippine Commission was early .drawn to the fact there is no entity in Spanish law exactly corresponding to the motion of the corporation in English'&nbsp; and American law; and in the Philippine Bill,&nbsp; approved July 1, 1906, the Congress of the United States inserted&nbsp; certain provisions, under the head of Franchises, which "were intended to control the Lawmaking power in the Philippine Islands in the&nbsp; matter of granting of franchises, privileges and concessions.&nbsp; These provisions&nbsp; are&nbsp; found in sections 74&nbsp; and 75&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Act,&nbsp; The&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of section&nbsp; 74 have&nbsp; been superseded' by&nbsp; section 28 of the&nbsp; Act of&nbsp; Congress of August 29, 1916, but in section 75 others&nbsp; is&nbsp; a provision referring to&nbsp; mining corporations,&nbsp; which&nbsp; still&nbsp; remains&nbsp; the&nbsp; law,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended.&nbsp; This provision, in its&nbsp; original form, reads as follows:&nbsp; * * * it&nbsp; shall be unlawful, for any member of a corporation engaged in agriculture or&nbsp; mining;&nbsp; and&nbsp; for&nbsp; any&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; organized&nbsp; for&nbsp; any&nbsp; purpose except irrigation&nbsp; to be in any wise interested&nbsp; in any other&nbsp; corporation engaged in&nbsp; agriculture or in mining.<br><br>Under the guidance of&nbsp; this and certain other provisions&nbsp; thus enacted by&nbsp; Congress,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Commission&nbsp; entered upon the enactment of a general law authorizing the creation of corporations ' in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; This&nbsp; rather&nbsp; elaborate&nbsp; piece of&nbsp; legislation is embodied&nbsp; in what is called-our Corporation Law (Act No. 1459 of the&nbsp; Philippine Commission).&nbsp; The evident purpose of the commission&nbsp; was&nbsp; to&nbsp; introduce&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; American&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; into the Philippine Islands as the standard commercial entity and to hasten the day when the <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span> of the Spanish law would be obsolete.&nbsp; That statute is a sort&nbsp; of codification of American corporate law."<br><br>"As&nbsp; it was the intention of&nbsp; our lawmakers to&nbsp; stimulate&nbsp; the introduction of the&nbsp; American corporation into the Philippine law in the place . of the <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>, it was necessary&nbsp; to&nbsp; make&nbsp; certain adjustment resulting from&nbsp; the&nbsp; continued&nbsp; co-existence,&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; time, of the two&nbsp; forms of&nbsp; commercial&nbsp; entities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, in&nbsp; section 75&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; Law,&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; provision is&nbsp; found&nbsp; making the <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span> subject to the provisions of the Corporation&nbsp; Law 'so&nbsp; far as such&nbsp; provisions may&nbsp; be applicable and&nbsp; giving to the <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades&nbsp; anonimas</span>&nbsp; previously created&nbsp; in the Islands the option to continue business as&nbsp; such&nbsp; or to reform and organize under the provisions&nbsp; of the Corporation&nbsp; Law.&nbsp; Again, in section&nbsp; 191 of the Corporation Law, the Code of&nbsp; Commerce&nbsp; is repealed in&nbsp; so far as it relates to <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades anonimas.</span>&nbsp; The purpose of the commission in&nbsp; repealing this part of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Commerce was :to compel commercial&nbsp; entities&nbsp; thereafter&nbsp; organized&nbsp; to&nbsp; incorporate under the Corporation&nbsp; Law, unless they&nbsp; should&nbsp; prefer to&nbsp; adopt&nbsp; some&nbsp; form or&nbsp; other of the&nbsp; partnership.&nbsp; To&nbsp; this&nbsp; provision was added" another to . the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that existing <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades&nbsp; anonimas</span>,&nbsp; which&nbsp; elected to continue their business as such, instead of&nbsp; reforming and reorganizing under the Corporation Law,&nbsp; should continue to be governed by the laws that were in force prior to the passage of this Act 'in&nbsp; relation to&nbsp; their organization&nbsp; and&nbsp; method&nbsp; of&nbsp; transacting business&nbsp; and to the&nbsp; rights&nbsp; of members thereof&nbsp; as&nbsp; between&nbsp; themselves, but&nbsp; their relations to the public and public&nbsp; officials shall&nbsp; be governed&nbsp; by the provisions of this Act.'"<br></blockquote>Specifically, the two sections&nbsp; of Act No. 1459 referring to sociedades anonimas&nbsp; then already existing, provide&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec,&nbsp; 75, Any corporation or&nbsp; a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad&nbsp; anonima</span> formed, organized, and existing under&nbsp; the&nbsp; laws of the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; on the date of the&nbsp; passage of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Act,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; subject to" the&nbsp; provisions. hereof so&nbsp; far as&nbsp; such 'provisions may be&nbsp; applicable and&nbsp; shall be entitled&nbsp; at its .option either to continue business as such corporation or to reform and&nbsp; organize&nbsp; under and by virtue of the provisions of this&nbsp; Act,&nbsp; transferring all corporate&nbsp; interests&nbsp; to the&nbsp; new corporation "which, if a stock&nbsp; corporation, is authorized&nbsp; to issue&nbsp; its shares of&nbsp; stock at par to the stockholders or members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; old corporation according to. their interests." <br><br>"Sec.&nbsp; 191.&nbsp; The&nbsp; Code of&nbsp; Commerce, in&nbsp; so far&nbsp; as it&nbsp; relates&nbsp; to corporation or&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades&nbsp; anonimas</span>,&nbsp; and all other&nbsp; Acts&nbsp; or&nbsp; parts of Acts in conflict or inconsistent&nbsp; with this&nbsp; Act, are hereby&nbsp; repealed. with the exception&nbsp; of&nbsp; Act Numbered fifty-two, entitled An Act providing"&nbsp; for examinations of&nbsp; banking&nbsp; institutions, in&nbsp; the Philippines, and for reports&nbsp; by&nbsp; their officers as&nbsp; amended,&nbsp; and Act Numbered&nbsp; 'Six&nbsp; hundred&nbsp; sixty-seven, entitled&nbsp; An Act&nbsp; prescribing the&nbsp; method of applying&nbsp; to governments of municipalities, except the&nbsp; city of&nbsp; Manila and&nbsp; of&nbsp; provinces for&nbsp; franchises to&nbsp; contract and&nbsp; operate&nbsp; street railway, electric&nbsp; light and power and&nbsp; telephone lines, the conditions upon which the same&nbsp; maybe&nbsp; granted, certain powers&nbsp; of the&nbsp; grantee&nbsp; of&nbsp; said franchises, and&nbsp; of&nbsp; grantees&nbsp; of similar&nbsp; franchises&nbsp; under&nbsp; special Act of the Commission,&nbsp; and&nbsp; for other purposes.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided,&nbsp; however, That&nbsp; nothing in&nbsp; this Act contained&nbsp; shall be deemed&nbsp; to repeal the&nbsp; existing&nbsp; law relating&nbsp; to those classes&nbsp; of associations which are termed <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades colectivas</span>, and&nbsp; sociedades&nbsp; de cuentas en participation, as to which association the existing law shall be&nbsp; deemed to&nbsp; be still in force; And provided further, That existing corporations or sociedades anonimas, lawfully organized as such, which elect to continue their&nbsp; business&nbsp; as such <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades&nbsp; anonimas</span> instead&nbsp; of&nbsp; reforming and&nbsp; reorganizing&nbsp; under and&nbsp; by' virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; this Act, shall continue&nbsp; to&nbsp; be governed by&nbsp; the&nbsp; laws that were in force&nbsp; prior to the passage&nbsp; of this Act in relation to their&nbsp; organization and&nbsp; method of transacting&nbsp; business and&nbsp; to&nbsp; the rights of&nbsp; members&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; as&nbsp; between themselves,&nbsp; but their&nbsp; relations&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; and public&nbsp; officials.' shall be governed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the provisions&nbsp; of this Act."<br></blockquote>As the expiration of its original- 50 year term of existence approached, the Board of Directors of Benguet adopted in 1946 a resolution to&nbsp; extend its life for another 50 years from July 3,&nbsp; 1946 and submitted it for&nbsp; registration.to the respondent Securities and Exchange Commissioner.&nbsp; Upon advice of the Secretary of Justice (Op. No, 45, Ser. 1947) that such,&nbsp; extension was&nbsp; contrary&nbsp; to law, the registration was denied.&nbsp; The matter was&nbsp; dropped,&nbsp; allegedly because the stockholders of Benguet did not approve&nbsp; of the Directors' action. <br><br>Some six years later in 1953, the shareholders of Benguet adopted a resolution empowering the Director&nbsp; to "effectuate the. extension of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Company's business&nbsp; life for not less than 20 and&nbsp; not more than 50 years, and this by either (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; an&nbsp; amendment&nbsp; to&nbsp; the Articles&nbsp; of Association&nbsp; or Charter&nbsp; of this Company or (2)&nbsp; by reforming and&nbsp; reorganizing&nbsp; the Company as a&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Corporation,&nbsp; or (3)&nbsp; by both or&nbsp; (4) -by any other means."&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the , Board of Directors .on&nbsp; May 27, 1953,&nbsp; adopted a resolution to the following&nbsp; effect—<br><br><center><i>"Be It </i><br></center><blockquote>Resolved, that the Company be reformed, reorganized and organized under the provisions of section 75 and other provisions of the Philippine Corporation&nbsp; Law as a Philippine corporation with a corporate life and corporate powers as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation&nbsp; attached hereto as Schedule 'I' and made&nbsp; a&nbsp; part hereof by this reference; and<br><center><br><i>"Be It </i><br></center><br>'FURTHER&nbsp; RESOLVED, that any five, or more of the following share-holders of the Company&nbsp; be and&nbsp; they&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; are&nbsp; authorized as instructed to act for and in behalf of the share&nbsp; holders of the Company&nbsp; and of the Company&nbsp; as&nbsp; Incorporators in the reformation, reorganization and organization&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Company&nbsp; under&nbsp; and in accordance with the provisions aforesaid of said&nbsp; Philippine Corporation Law,&nbsp; and&nbsp; in such&nbsp; capacity, they are hereby authorized and&nbsp; instructed&nbsp; to execute the aforesaid . Articles of Incorporation attached to&nbsp; these Minutes&nbsp; as Schedule T. hereof, with such amendments, deletion&nbsp; and&nbsp; additions thereto as any five or&nbsp; more of those so acting shall deem&nbsp; necessary, proper, advisable or convenient to effect prompt&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; Articles&nbsp; under Philippine Law;&nbsp; and five or more of said Incorporators&nbsp; are hereby&nbsp; further authorized and directed to&nbsp; do&nbsp; all things necessary, proper, advisable or convenient to effect such registration."</blockquote>In&nbsp; pursuance of such resolution, Benguet submitted&nbsp; in June, 1953, to the Securities and Exchange Commissioner, for alternative registration, two documents: (1) Certification as to&nbsp; the Modification of (the articles of association of) the Benguet Consolidated Mining Company, extending the term of its existence to another fifty&nbsp; years&nbsp; from June 15, 1953; and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; articles of incorporation, covering its reformation or reorganization as a corporation in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; section 75 of the Philippine Corporation Law.<br><br>Relying&nbsp; mainly upon&nbsp; the adverse opinion of the&nbsp; Secretary.of Justice (Op. No. 180, s. 1953), the Securities and Exchange Commissioner denied the registration and ruled:<br><br>(1) That the Benguet, as <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>, had no right to extend the original&nbsp; term of&nbsp; corporate existence stated in its Articles of Association,&nbsp; by subsequent amendment thereof adopted after enactment of the Corporation&nbsp; Law (Act No. 1459);&nbsp; and<br><br>(2) That Benguet, by its&nbsp; conduct,&nbsp; had chosen&nbsp; to&nbsp; continue as <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anomina,</span> under section 75 of Act No. 1459, and could&nbsp; no&nbsp; longer exercise the option&nbsp; to reform into a corporation, specially since it would, indirectly produce the effect of extending its life.<br><br>This ruling&nbsp; is the subject of&nbsp; the present appeal.<br><br>Petitioner Benguet contends:<br><br>(1) That the proviso of section 18 of the Corporation Law&nbsp; to the effect—<br><blockquote>"that&nbsp; the life of said&nbsp; corporation <i>shall not&nbsp; be&nbsp; extended</i> by amendment&nbsp; beyond the lime&nbsp; fixed in the original&nbsp; articles."<br></blockquote>does <i>not</i> apply to&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades anomimas</span> already in existence at the passage of the law,&nbsp; like petitioner&nbsp; herein;<br><br>(2) That to apply the said Restriction imposed by section&nbsp; 18&nbsp; of the Corporation Law&nbsp; to&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades&nbsp; anonimas</span> already&nbsp; functioning when the said law was enacted would be in violation of constitutional inhibitions;<br><br>(3) That even assuming that said restriction was&nbsp; applicable to it, Benguet&nbsp; could&nbsp; still&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; the&nbsp; option of reforming and reorganizing under section&nbsp; 75 of the Corporation Law, thereby prolonging its corporate&nbsp; existence, since&nbsp; the law is silent&nbsp; as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; time when&nbsp; such option may be&nbsp; exercised or availed of.<br><br>The first issue arises because the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Commerce of 1886 under which Benguet was organized, contains no prohibition&nbsp; (to extend the&nbsp; period&nbsp; of&nbsp; corporate existence), equivalent to that set forth in section&nbsp; 18 of the&nbsp; Corporation Law.&nbsp; Neither does it expressly authorize the extension.&nbsp; But the text of Article 223, reading:<br><blockquote>"ART. 223. After&nbsp; the termination of&nbsp; the&nbsp; period for which commercial associations are constituted,&nbsp; it&nbsp; shall not be understood as extended&nbsp; by the implied&nbsp; or presumed&nbsp; will of the members;&nbsp; and if the&nbsp; members desire to continue in association, they&nbsp; shall draw up new articles, subject to&nbsp; all&nbsp; the formalities prescribed&nbsp; for their creation as provided in Article 119."&nbsp; (Code of&nbsp; Commerce.)<br></blockquote>would seem to&nbsp; imply that&nbsp; the period of existence of&nbsp; the <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>s (or of any other commercial association for&nbsp; that matter) may&nbsp; be extended&nbsp; if the partners&nbsp; or members so&nbsp; agree before the expiration of the&nbsp; original period.,<br><br>While the&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of Commerce, in so far&nbsp; as sociedades anonimas&nbsp; are concerned, was&nbsp; repealed by&nbsp; Act No. 1459, Benguet&nbsp; claims&nbsp; that article 223 is still operative in&nbsp; its favor under the last proviso of section 191 of the Corporation law&nbsp; (ante, p. 4 to the effect that&nbsp; existing sociedades anonimas&nbsp; would&nbsp; continue to&nbsp; be governed by the law in force&nbsp; before Act 1459,<br><blockquote>"in relation to their organization and method of&nbsp; transacting business and to the rights of&nbsp; members&nbsp; among themselves, but their relations to the' public and public&nbsp; officials shall be governed by the provisions of this Act."<br></blockquote>Benguet contends that the period of corporate life relates to its organization and the rights of its members inter se,' and not to its relations to&nbsp; the, public or public&nbsp; officials.<br><br>We find this contention untenable.<br><br>The term of existence of association&nbsp;&nbsp; (partnership or <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anomima</span>) is coterminous with their possession of an independent legal personality, distinct from that of their component&nbsp; members.&nbsp; When the period&nbsp; expires,&nbsp; the <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anomima</span><i></i> loses&nbsp; the power to&nbsp; deal and&nbsp; enter&nbsp; into further legal&nbsp; relations with&nbsp; other persons; it is no longer possible for it to acquire new rights&nbsp; or incur new obligations,&nbsp; have only&nbsp; as may be required&nbsp; by the&nbsp; process of liquidating and winding up its affairs.&nbsp; By the same token, its officers&nbsp; and agents can&nbsp; no&nbsp; longer represent&nbsp; it&nbsp; after the expiration of the life term prescribed, save for settling its&nbsp; business.&nbsp;&nbsp; Necessarily,&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; third persons&nbsp; or strangers have an interest in knowing the duration of the juridical&nbsp; personality of the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>,, .since the latter&nbsp; can not be dealt with after that period;&nbsp; wherefore its&nbsp; prolongation or cessation is a matter directly involving the company's relations to the public at large.<br><br>On the importance of the term of existence&nbsp; set in the articles of association of commercial&nbsp; companies&nbsp; under the Spanish Code of&nbsp; Commerce, D. Lorenzo&nbsp; Benito y Endar, professor of mercantile law in the Universidad&nbsp; Central de Madrid, has this&nbsp; to&nbsp; say:<br><blockquote>"<i>La duration&nbsp; de&nbsp; la&nbsp; Sociedad.</i>—La necesidad&nbsp; de' consignar este requisito&nbsp; en&nbsp; el&nbsp; cotitrato social tiene&nbsp; mi&nbsp; valor analogo al qua dijinios&nbsp; tenia el mismo&nbsp; al&nbsp; tratar&nbsp; de&nbsp; las&nbsp; compafiias colectivas, aun cuando respecto de las anonimas no&nbsp; haya de tenerse en cuenta para nada lo que dijimos entonces acerca&nbsp; da" la trascendencia quo ello tiene para&nbsp; Ios socios; porque no existiendo&nbsp; en las&nbsp; mimimas&nbsp; la serie de responsibilidades de caracter personal ;que afectan&nbsp; a Ios socios coleetivos, es&nbsp; claro que la duraci6n de la soeiedad iraporta conocerla a Ios socios y los&nbsp; terceros, porque ella marca&nbsp; el&nbsp; limite natural del desenvolvimiento de la empresa constituida y el comienzo de la Iiquidacion de&nbsp; la sociedad."&nbsp;&nbsp; (3 Benito, Dereclio&nbsp; Mercantil,&nbsp; 292-293.)<br><br>"Interesa, pues, la&nbsp; fijacion&nbsp; de&nbsp; la vida de la&nbsp; compañia, desenvol-viendose con normalidad y regularidad, tanto a&nbsp; los asociados&nbsp; eomo a los terceros.&nbsp; A&nbsp; aquellos, porque&nbsp; su&nbsp; libertad economica, en cierto J modo limitada por la existencia del contrato de compafiia, se&nbsp; recobra despues&nbsp; de&nbsp; realisada, mas&nbsp; 6 menos&nbsp; cumplidamente, la finalidad comun perseguida; y a&nbsp; los terceros, porque les advierte el momento en que,&nbsp; extinguida la compania, no cabe y a la creation con ella de nuevas rel'aciones juridicas, de que hazcan reciprocamente&nbsp; derechos&nbsp; y obligaciones,&nbsp; sino solo la liquidacion&nbsp; de&nbsp; los negocios hasta;: entonces convenidos, sin&nbsp; otra eseepci6n&nbsp; que la que luego mas adelante habremos de sefialar".&nbsp; (3 Benito,&nbsp; Derecho Mercantil, p. 245.)<br></blockquote>The State and its&nbsp; officers&nbsp; also&nbsp; have an obvious interest in the&nbsp; term of life&nbsp; of associations, since the&nbsp; conferment of juridical capacity upon them&nbsp; during&nbsp; such period&nbsp; is&nbsp; a privilege that is derived from statute.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious&nbsp; that no agreement between associates&nbsp; can result in giving rise to a new and distinct personality,&nbsp; possessing independent rights&nbsp; and obligations,&nbsp; unless the .law itself shall&nbsp; decree such result.&nbsp; And; the State is naturally&nbsp; interested&nbsp; that this&nbsp; privilege be&nbsp; enjoyed only under the conditions&nbsp; and not beyond the period that it sees fit to grant; and, particularly, that it be not&nbsp; abused in fraud and to the detriment of other parties;&nbsp; and&nbsp; for this reason it has been ruled that "the limitation&nbsp; (of&nbsp; corporate existence) to a definite period is an exercise&nbsp; of control in the interest of the public" (Smith <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Eastwood Wire Manufacturing Co., 43 Atl. 568).<br><br>We can&nbsp; not assent&nbsp; to the&nbsp; thesis&nbsp; of Benguet&nbsp; that its period&nbsp; of corporate existence has relation to its "organization".&nbsp; The latter term is defined in Webster's International Dictionary as:<br><blockquote>"The executive structure of a business; the personnel of management, with its&nbsp; several duties&nbsp; and places&nbsp; in&nbsp; administration; the various&nbsp; persons who conduct a&nbsp; business, considered as&nbsp; a&nbsp; unit."<br></blockquote>The legal definitions of ,the term "organization" are concordant with that given&nbsp; above:&nbsp;<blockquote>"Organize&nbsp; or 'organization, as used in Reference to corporations, lias, a well-understood meaning, which is&nbsp; the&nbsp; election&nbsp; of officers, providing for the subscription&nbsp; and&nbsp; payment of the capital&nbsp; stock,&nbsp; the&nbsp; adoption&nbsp; of by-laws,&nbsp; and such other&nbsp; steps as&nbsp; are necessary to endow the legal entity with the capacity to transact the legitimate&nbsp; business for&nbsp; which&nbsp; it&nbsp; was created-&nbsp; Waltson&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Oliver, SO P. 172, 173, 49&nbsp; Kan. 107, 33 Am.

This&nbsp; conclusion is reinforced by the avowed policy of the law to hasten the day when companias&nbsp; anonimas would, be extinct,&nbsp; and&nbsp; replace&nbsp; them with the&nbsp; American&nbsp; type of corporation (Harden <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Behguet Consolidated Mining Co., supra),&nbsp; for the indefinite prorogation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the corporation life of sodedades anonimas would maintain the&nbsp; unnecessary duality of organizational types, instead&nbsp; of&nbsp; reducing them to&nbsp; a "single one; and what is more,&nbsp; it would confer upon these sodedades anonimas,&nbsp; whose obsolescence was sought,&nbsp; the advantageous privilege of&nbsp; perpetual existence that the new corporation could not&nbsp; possess.<br><br>Of course, the retroactive application of the limitations on the terms of corporate existence could not be made in violation of constitutional inhibitions specially those securing equal&nbsp; protection of&nbsp; the laws&nbsp; and prohibiting impairment of&nbsp; the obligation of contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp; It needs no argument to&nbsp; show that if Act No. 1459 allowed&nbsp; existing compañias anonimas&nbsp; to be governed by the old law in respect to their organization, methods.of transacting business and the rights . of the members&nbsp; among themselves, it was&nbsp; precisely in deference&nbsp; to&nbsp; the vested rights&nbsp; already acquired by&nbsp; the entity and its members at the time&nbsp; the Corporation&nbsp; Law was enacted.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we do not agree with petitioner Benguet (and here lies the&nbsp; second issue in this appeal)&nbsp; that the possibility to extend its corporate life&nbsp; under&nbsp; the Code of Commerce constituted a&nbsp; right already vested when Act No. 1459&nbsp; was adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, Benguet's existence was well within the 50&nbsp; years period set in its articles of association;&nbsp; and&nbsp; its members had not entered into&nbsp; any agreement that such period should be extended.&nbsp; It is safe to say that none of the members of Benguet anticipated in 1906 any need to&nbsp; reach an agreement to&nbsp; increase the term of its corporate life, barely three years&nbsp; after it&nbsp; had started.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; prorogation was purely speculative; a mere possibility that could not be taken&nbsp; for granted.&nbsp; It was as yet conditional,&nbsp; depending upon&nbsp; the ultimate decision of the members and directors.&nbsp; They&nbsp; might agree&nbsp; to extend Benguet's existence beyond the&nbsp; original 50 years; or again they might not.&nbsp; It must be remembered that in 1906, the success,&nbsp; of Benguet&nbsp; in its mining ventures was by no means so certain as to warrant continuation of its operations beyond the 50 years set in its articles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; records of&nbsp; this Court show that Benguet ran into financial&nbsp; difficulties in the early part of its existence, to the extent that, as&nbsp; late&nbsp; as&nbsp; 1913, ten years after&nbsp; it was&nbsp; found,&nbsp; 301,100 shares&nbsp; of its capital stock&nbsp; (with&nbsp; a&nbsp; par value&nbsp; of&nbsp; $1 per share)&nbsp; were being offered for sale at 25&nbsp; centavos per share in&nbsp; order to raise the sum of P75,000 that was heeded to&nbsp; rehabilitate the&nbsp; company (Hanlon <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Hausermann and Beam,&nbsp; 40 Phil., 790).&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly&nbsp; the prolongation of the corporate existence of Benguet in 1906&nbsp; was merely a possibility in futuro,&nbsp; a contingency&nbsp; that did not&nbsp; fulfill the requirements of&nbsp; a vested right entitled to constitutional protection, defined by this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in Balboa&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Farrales, 51&nbsp; Phil., 498, 502,&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>"Vested right is&nbsp; 'some right&nbsp; or interest in the property&nbsp; which has become fixed and established, and&nbsp; is&nbsp; no longer open to doubt or&nbsp; controversy,"<br><br>"A&nbsp; 'vested' right is defined&nbsp; to&nbsp; be an immediate fixed&nbsp; right&nbsp; of present&nbsp; or future&nbsp; enjoyment,&nbsp; and rights are 'vested'&nbsp; in .contradistinction&nbsp; to being expectant&nbsp; or contingent"&nbsp; (Pearsall <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span>&nbsp; Great Northern R. Co., 161 IT. S. 646,&nbsp; 40 L. Ed. 838).<br></blockquote>In Corpus Juris Secundum we&nbsp; find:<br><blockquote>"Rights are vested&nbsp; when the right&nbsp; to&nbsp; enjoyment, present&nbsp; or prospective, has&nbsp; become&nbsp; the&nbsp; property of some particular person or&nbsp; persons as a&nbsp; present interest. The right must be absolute, .complete,&nbsp; and unconditional, independent of a contingency, and&nbsp; a mere expectancy&nbsp; of future benefit,&nbsp; or&nbsp; a&nbsp; contingent interest&nbsp; in property founded on anticipated continuance of existing laws, does not&nbsp; constitute a&nbsp; vested&nbsp; right.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; inchoate&nbsp; rights which&nbsp; have not been acted on. are not&nbsp; vested."&nbsp; (16 C. J, S.&nbsp; 214-215.)<br></blockquote>Since there was no agreement as yet to extend the period of Benguet's corporate existence (beyond the&nbsp; original 50 years) when the&nbsp; Corporation Law was adopted in 1906, neither Benguet nor its&nbsp; members had&nbsp; any actual&nbsp; or vested right&nbsp; to&nbsp; such extension at that time.&nbsp; Therefore, when the Corporation Law, by section 18, forbade extensions of corporate life,&nbsp; neither&nbsp; Benguet nor&nbsp; its&nbsp; members&nbsp; were deprived of any actual or&nbsp; fixed right constitutionally&nbsp; protected.<br><br>To hold, as petitioner Benguet asks, that the legislative power could not deprive Benguet or its members&nbsp; of the imssibilitij to enter at some indefinite future time into an agreement to extend Benguet's corporate life, solely because such 'agreements were authorized by the Code of Commerce, would&nbsp; be tantamount to saying that&nbsp; the said Code was irrepealable on&nbsp; that point.&nbsp; It is a well settled rule&nbsp; that no person .has a vested interest in any rule of law entitling him&nbsp; to&nbsp; insist that&nbsp; it&nbsp; shall, remain&nbsp; unchanged for his benefit.&nbsp; (New York C.

(16 0.&nbsp; J. S. 222-228.) It is a general&nbsp; rule of constitutional&nbsp; law&nbsp; that a person has no vested&nbsp; right&nbsp; in&nbsp; statutory privileges and&nbsp; exemptions"&nbsp; (Brearly School&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ward,&nbsp; 201 NY. S58,&nbsp; 40&nbsp; LRA NS. 1215; also, Cooloy, Constitutional Limitations, 7th ed., p. 546).<br></blockquote>It is not amiss to recall here that&nbsp; after Act No. 1459 the Legislature found it advisable to impress further restrictions upon the power of corporations to 'deal in public lands, or to&nbsp; hold&nbsp; real&nbsp; estate&nbsp; beyond a maximum area;&nbsp; and to prohibit any corporation from endeavouring to control or hold&nbsp; more&nbsp; than 15&nbsp; per cent of the&nbsp; voting&nbsp; stock of an. agricultural or mining corporation (Act No. 3518).&nbsp; These prohibitions are so closely integrated with our public policy that Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No^ 219&nbsp; sought to&nbsp; extend&nbsp; such restrictions to associations of all kinds.&nbsp; It would be subversive&nbsp; of that&nbsp; policy to enable Benguet to prolong its peculiar status of sociedad ammimas, and&nbsp; enable it to cast doubt and uncertainty on whether it is, or not, subject to those restrictions on corporate power, as it once endeavoured to do in&nbsp; the previous case of&nbsp; Harden <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Benguet Mining Corp. 58 Phil., 149.<br><br>Stress&nbsp; has been laid upon the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that the Compania Maritima (like&nbsp; Benguet,&nbsp; a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad&nbsp; anonima</span>&nbsp; established before the enactment of&nbsp; the Corporation Law) has been twice permitted to extend its corporate existence by, amendment of its articles of association, without objection from the&nbsp; officers of the defunct Bureau of Commerce and Industry, then in charge of the enforcement of&nbsp; the Corporation Laws,&nbsp; although the&nbsp; exact question was&nbsp; never raised then.&nbsp; Be that as&nbsp; it may, it is a well established rule in this jurisdiction&nbsp; that the government is never estopped by mistake or error on the part of its agents"&nbsp;&nbsp; (Pineda <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Court of First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Tayabas,&nbsp; 52 Phil., 803,&nbsp; 807), and that estopped&nbsp; can not give validity to an&nbsp; act that is prohibited by law or is against public policy&nbsp; (Eugenio <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Perdido, (97 Phil., 41, May 19, 1955; 19 Am.

"formed, organized and&nbsp; existing&nbsp; under the laws of the Philippines on the date of the passage of this Act" to either continue business as such <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>&nbsp; or. to reform and organize under the provisions of the Corporation Law. Petitioner-appellant Benguet contends&nbsp; that as the law does not determine the period within which such option may be exercised, Benguet may exercise it at any time during its corporate existence;&nbsp; and that in fact on June 22, 1953, it&nbsp; chose to&nbsp; reform itself into a corporation for a period of 50 years&nbsp; from that date, filing the corresponding papers <br><md by-laws="" with="" respondent ="" commissioner="" of="" securities="" and="" exchange="" registration;="" but="" the="" latter="" refused="" to="" accept="" them="" as="" belatedly="" made.=""><br>The petitioner's argument proceeds from the unexpressed assumption&nbsp; that&nbsp; Benguet,&nbsp; as&nbsp; sociedad&nbsp; ammima,&nbsp; had not exercised the option given by section 75 of the Corporation Law&nbsp; until&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp; This&nbsp; we find&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; incorrect.&nbsp; Under that section, by continuing to do business as <i>sociedad anonima</i>, Benguet in fact rejected the alternative to reform as a corporation under Act No.&nbsp; 1459.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will&nbsp; be noted from the text of section 75 (quoted earlier in this opinion) that no special act or manifestation is required by the law from the existing <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades anonimas</span> that prefer to remain and continue as such.&nbsp; It is when they choose to reform&nbsp; and organize under&nbsp; the Corporation&nbsp; Law that&nbsp; they must in the words of the&nbsp; section, ''transfer all corporate interests to the new&nbsp; corporation".&nbsp; Hence if they do not so transfer, the sociedades amdnimas affected are to be understood to have elected the&nbsp; alternative" "to continue business as such&nbsp; corporation" (<span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad amnima</span>)<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [2].</span></sup><br><br>The election of Benguet to&nbsp; remain a&nbsp; <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i> after the enactment&nbsp; of the Corporation Law is&nbsp; evidence, not only by its failure, from 1906 to 1953, to adopt the alternative&nbsp; to transfer&nbsp; its corporate interests&nbsp; to a new corporation, as required by section 75; it also appears from positive acts.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; around&nbsp; 1933, Benguet claimed&nbsp; and defended in court its acquisition of shares of the capital stock of the Balatoc Mining Company, on the ground that as a&nbsp;</md> <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i><md by-laws="" with="" respondent ="" commissioner="" of="" securities="" and="" exchange="" registration;="" but="" the="" latter="" refused="" to="" accept="" them="" as="" belatedly="" made.=""> it (Benguet) was not a corporation. within&nbsp; the&nbsp; purview of the laws prohibiting a mining corporation from becoming interested in another mining corporation&nbsp; (Harden<i> vs.</i> Benguet Mining Corp., 58&nbsp; Phi).,&nbsp; p. 1.49);&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the present proceedings, Benguet hag urged its right to amend its original articles of association&nbsp; as "</md> <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i><md by-laws="" with="" respondent ="" commissioner="" of="" securities="" and="" exchange="" registration;="" but="" the="" latter="" refused="" to="" accept="" them="" as="" belatedly="" made.="">"&nbsp; and extend its life as such under the provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Spanish Code of Commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such appeals to privileges as "</md> <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i><md by-laws="" with="" respondent ="" commissioner="" of="" securities="" and="" exchange="" registration;="" but="" the="" latter="" refused="" to="" accept="" them="" as="" belatedly="" made.="">" under the Code of 1886 necessarily&nbsp; imply that Benguet&nbsp; has&nbsp; rejected the alternative&nbsp; of reforming under the Corporation Law.&nbsp; As respondent Commissioner's order, now under&nbsp; appeal, has stated—<blockquote>"A&nbsp; <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i> could not claim the benefit of both, but must have to choose one and discard the other.&nbsp; If it elected to become a corporation it could not continue as a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>;&nbsp; and if it choose&nbsp; to remain as a&nbsp; <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i> it could&nbsp; not&nbsp; become a corporation."<br></blockquote>Having thus&nbsp; made its choice, Benguet.may not&nbsp; now&nbsp; go back and seek to change its position and adppt the reformation that it had formerly&nbsp; repudiated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The election of one of several&nbsp; alternatives, is&nbsp; irrevocable once made&nbsp; (as now expressly recognized in article 940 of the new Civil Code of the&nbsp; Philippines) :&nbsp; such rule is inherent in the nature of the choice, its purpose being to clarify and render definite the rights&nbsp; of the one exercising the option, so that other persons may act in consequence.&nbsp; While successive choices may be provided there' is nothing&nbsp; in section 75&nbsp; of the Corporation Law to&nbsp; show or hint that a&nbsp;</md> <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i><md by-laws="" with="" respondent ="" commissioner="" of="" securities="" and="" exchange="" registration;="" but="" the="" latter="" refused="" to="" accept="" them="" as="" belatedly="" made.=""> may&nbsp; make&nbsp; more than one choice thereunder, since only one option&nbsp; is provided for.<br><br>While no express period of time is fixed by the law within which sociedad.es wnonimas may elect under section 75 of Act No, 1459 either to reform or to retain their status quo, there are powerful reasons to conclude that the legislature, intended such choice to be made within a reasonable time from the effectivity&nbsp; of the Act.&nbsp; To&nbsp; enable a&nbsp; sociedad amonitna to&nbsp; choose reformation when its stipulated period of existence is nearly ended, would be to allow it to enjoy a term&nbsp; of existence far longer than that granted to&nbsp; corporations organized under the Corporation Law; in Ben- guet's case,&nbsp; 50 years as sociedad ammdma, and another 50 years as an&nbsp; American type of corporation under Act 1459; a result incompatible with .the avowed purpose of the Act to hasten the disappearance of the <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades anonimas</span>. Moreover, such belated election,&nbsp; if permitted, would enable <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades anonimas</span> to&nbsp; reap the full&nbsp; advantage of both' types of organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it would permit sociedades awonimas to prolong their corporate&nbsp; existence&nbsp; indirectly by belated reformation into corporations&nbsp; under&nbsp; Act No. 1459, when they could not do so directly by amending their articles of association.<br><br>Much stress is laid upon allegedly improper motives on the part&nbsp; of the intervenor, Consolidated Mines, Inc., in supporting the orders appealed&nbsp; from,&nbsp; on the ground&nbsp; that intervenor,seeks to&nbsp; terminate Benguet's operating contract and appropriate the profits that are the result of Benguet's efforts in developing the mines of the intervenor.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that whatever such motives should be, they are wholly irrelevant to the issues in this&nbsp; appeal, that&nbsp; exclusively&nbsp; concern the legal&nbsp; soundness of the order of the respondent Securities and&nbsp; Exchange Commissioner rejecting the claims of the Benguet Consolidated Mining Company to extend its&nbsp; corporate life.<br><br>Neither are we impressed by the prophesies of economic chaos that would&nbsp; allegedly ensure with the cessation of Benguet's activities.&nbsp; If its mining properties are&nbsp; really susceptible&nbsp; of profitable&nbsp; operation, inexorable&nbsp; economic. laws will ensure their exploitation; if,&nbsp; on the other hand, they can no longerj be worked at&nbsp; a profit, then catastrophe becomes inevitable,&nbsp; whether or not petitioner Benguet retains corporate existence. Sustaining the opinions of the respondent Securities and Exchange Commissioner and of the Secretary of Justice, we rule that:<br><br>(1) The prohibition contained in section 18 of Act No. 1459, against extending the period of corporate existence by amendment of the original articles, was intended to apply, and does&nbsp; apply, to sociedades&nbsp; andnimas already formed, organized and existing at the time of the eff ectivity of the Corporation Law (Act No.&nbsp; 1459)&nbsp; in 1906;<br><br>(2) The statutory&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; is valid&nbsp; and impairs no vested rights or constitutional inhibition where no&nbsp; agreement to extend the original period of corporate life was perfected before the enactment of the Corporation Law;<br><br>(3) A soeiedad (minima, existing before the Corporation Law, that continues to do business as such for a reasonable time after its&nbsp; enactments,&nbsp; is deemed to have made its election and may not&nbsp; subsequently claim to reform&nbsp; into a corporation under section 75 of Act No. 1459.<br><br>In view of the&nbsp; foregoing, the order appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner-appellant Benguet Consolidated Mining Company.<br><br><i>Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes, A.

It has been a leading enterprise,&nbsp; Jong and&nbsp; widely reputed to have pioneered&nbsp; in&nbsp; and boosted the mining industry, distributed profits among its shareholders,&nbsp; and given employment to thousands.&nbsp;&nbsp; To be&nbsp; more approximately exact, the petitioner ha£&nbsp; kept on its payrolls over four thousand Filipino employees, who&nbsp; have about twenty thousand dependents.&nbsp; The taxes&nbsp; and other dues paid by&nbsp; it to the Government have been in enormous amounts.&nbsp; It has always been subject to such supervision and control of Government officials aa are prescribed by law.<br><br>When, therefore, the petitioner on June&nbsp; 3,1953, presented all necessary documents to the respondent,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Securities and Exchange Commissioner, with a view to the extension of its term as a&nbsp; sodedad anonima for&nbsp; a period&nbsp; of&nbsp; fifty years from June. 15, 1953; when&nbsp; on June 22, 1953, it filed with said respondent the necessary articles of incorporation and other&nbsp; documents,&nbsp; with a&nbsp; view&nbsp; to reforming itself as , a corporation&nbsp; under&nbsp; the Corporation Law for a&nbsp; period of fifty years&nbsp; from June 22,&nbsp; 1953, followed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; filing on July 22, 1953,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the corresponding by-laws;&nbsp; and&nbsp; when on October 27, 1S53, the respondent issued an order denying the registration of the instruments as well for exten- . sion as for reformation^ petitioner's corporate life&nbsp; was being snapped out with such&nbsp; lightning abruptness as undoubtedly to spell damage and prejudice not so much to its shareholders as to its beneficiaries—thousands of employees&nbsp; and their dependents—and even to the Government which stands to lose a good source of revenue.<br><br>The&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; contends (1)&nbsp; that the respondent had the ministerial duty of registering the documents presented either&nbsp; for extension of petitioner's term&nbsp; as a sodedad anonima or for its reformation under the&nbsp; Corporation Law, in the&nbsp; absence (as&nbsp; in this&nbsp; case)&nbsp; of any&nbsp; pretense&nbsp; that said documents are formally defective or that petitioner's purposes&nbsp; are&nbsp; unlawful; and&nbsp; (2).&nbsp; that&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner had&nbsp; organized as a&nbsp; sodedad anonima under the Code of Commerce&gt; it&nbsp; has acquired a vested right&nbsp; which cannot subsequently be affected or taken away by the Corporation Law enacted on April&nbsp; 1, 1906.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; would not dwell upon these contentions, because I&nbsp; hold&nbsp; that,&nbsp; even under the provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Corporation Law, the petitioner&nbsp; may either extend its life as a sodedad anonima or reform as a corporation.<br><br>Section&nbsp; 75 of the Corporation Law&nbsp; provides:<blockquote>"Any corporation or <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span> formed, organized and existing under the laws of the Philippine Islands and lawfully transacting business in the&nbsp;

corporation which, if a stock&nbsp; corporation,&nbsp; is&nbsp; authorized to&nbsp; issue its shares&nbsp; of&nbsp; stock at par to the stockholders or members of the old corporation according to their interests."<br></blockquote>Upon the&nbsp; other hand, section 191 reads as follows<blockquote>"The&nbsp; Code of Commerce, in so far as&nbsp; it relates to corporations or <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedades&nbsp; anonimas</span>, and all&nbsp;

members thereof as between themselves, but their relations&nbsp; to the public and public officials'shall be governed by&nbsp; the provisions of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Act."<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is noteworthy&nbsp; that&nbsp; section 75 has&nbsp; not limited&nbsp; the optional continuance&nbsp; of a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad&nbsp; anonima</span> to&nbsp; its unexpired term, and section 191 expressly&nbsp;

the enactment of the Corporation Law in relation to its organization and method of transactingybusine&amp;s and to the rights of members as between themselves.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that the Code&nbsp; of Commerce, while containing&nbsp; no express&nbsp; provision&nbsp; allowing it, does not prohibit a sociedad anfmima from extending its term;&nbsp; and commentators Gay de Monteila&nbsp; (Tratado&nbsp; Practico&nbsp; de&nbsp; Sociedad&nbsp; Marcantiles—Companias Andnimas,&nbsp; Tomo&nbsp; II,&nbsp; p. 285)&nbsp; and Cesar&nbsp; Vivante (Tratado&nbsp; de Derecho Mercantil, pp. 254, 258)&nbsp; have&nbsp; observed&nbsp; that a sociedad andnima may prolong its corporate duration by amendment of its articles of association before the expiration&nbsp; of the term.<br><br>When a business or commercial association is organized, the members are naturally interested in knowing not only their&nbsp; rights and obligations but also&nbsp; the duration of their legal&nbsp; relations.&nbsp;&nbsp; While "organization" in&nbsp; a strict&nbsp; sense may refer&nbsp; to formalities like election of officers, adoption of by-laws, and subscription and payment&nbsp; of capital stock, it cannot be&nbsp; spoken of&nbsp; or conceived in&nbsp; a&nbsp; wider&nbsp; sense without necessarily involving the specification of the term of the entity formed.&nbsp; Extension of corporation&nbsp; life is thus essentially an incident of "organization" and, in any event, a matter directly&nbsp; affecting&nbsp; or in relation to the rights of the shareholders as; between themselves, within the&nbsp; contemplation of section 191, and should accordingly be&nbsp; governed&nbsp; by the Code of Commerce.&nbsp; As pointed out by'the Supreme Court of Wyoming in the&nbsp; case of&nbsp;&nbsp; Drew vs. Beckwith, (114 P. 2d. 98), extension "merely involves an additional privilege to carry out the business of enterprise undertaken by the corporation," and is "but an enlargement of the enterprise&nbsp; undertaken by&nbsp; the corporation."&nbsp; It is true that the duration of a soeiedad anonima is of&nbsp; some concern to the&nbsp; public and public officials who ought to know the time when it will cease to&nbsp; exist&nbsp; and its business will be wound up.&nbsp; Notice to the world is however served by&nbsp; the registration of petitioner's articles, of association as a&nbsp; soeiedad andnima or&nbsp; articles of incorporation as a reformed&nbsp; corporation with the Securities&nbsp; and&nbsp; Exchange Commission.<br><br>When section 191 .mentions "relations to the&nbsp; public and public officials"&nbsp; as 'being&nbsp; governed&nbsp; by&nbsp; the provisions of the Corporation Law, the idea is obviously more to enable the Government to enforce its powers of&nbsp; supervision, inspection and investigation, than to restrict the. freedom of the corporate&nbsp; entity&nbsp; as&nbsp; to organizational&nbsp; or substantive rights of members as between themselves.&nbsp; In&nbsp; one of the public hearings&nbsp; conducted by the Philippine Commission before the enactinent of the Corporation Law, Commissioner We pertinently expressed,&nbsp; "Of course, whether they (sociedades)&nbsp; come under the new law or not they would be subject to inspection, regulations, and examination for the purpose of protecting the community.."&nbsp; The Attorney General in turn held that&nbsp; sodedades&nbsp; anonirnas,&nbsp; although governed&nbsp; by the Code&nbsp; of Commerce,&nbsp; are subject to the examination&nbsp; provided&nbsp; in section&nbsp; 54 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Corporation Law&nbsp; (5 Op.&nbsp; Atty. Gen. 442).&nbsp; In this' connection, the petitioner has admittedly&nbsp; subjected itself to the provisions of the Corporation Law.<br><br>In&nbsp; Harden vs.&nbsp; Benguet&nbsp; Consolidated&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Co., 58 Phil., 141, it was remarked: "The purpose of&nbsp; the commission in&nbsp; repealing this part of the Code of Commerce was to compel commercial entities thereafter&nbsp; organized to incorporate&nbsp; under the Corporation Law, unless&nbsp; they should prefer to&nbsp; adopt some form or other of&nbsp; the partnership." This Court already indicated that the&nbsp; commercial entities compelled to incorporate under the Corporation Law were those organized after its&nbsp; enactment.<br><br>Section&nbsp; 6, subsection 4,&nbsp; of the Corporation Law provides that the term for which corporations shall exist&nbsp; shall not exceed fifty years; section 18 provides that the&nbsp; life of&nbsp; a corporation shall not be&nbsp; extended&nbsp; by&nbsp; amendment beyond the time fixed in the original articles;&nbsp; and section 11 provides that upon the issuance by the Securities and Exchange Commissioner of the certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; incorporation, the persons&nbsp; organizing .the corporation shall constitute a body" politic and corporate for the term specified in the articles of&nbsp; incorporation, not exceeding fifty years.&nbsp; The corporations contemplated are those defined&nbsp; in section 22—corporations organized under the Corporation&nbsp; Law.&nbsp; They cannot be sodedades an&amp;trimas formed under the Code of Commerce and licensed to continue as such in virtue of sections 75&nbsp; and 191. Otherwise the&nbsp; words&nbsp; "<span style="font-style: italic;">or socieded anonima</span>" would have been added to the term "corporation" in section 18, as was done&nbsp; in&nbsp; sections 75&nbsp; and 191.&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar observation was made in Harden vs. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., supra: "But when the word corporation is used&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; sense of&nbsp; sodedad anonima and&nbsp; close discrimination is necessary, it should be associated&nbsp; with the Spanish expression sodedad andnima either in parenthesis or&nbsp; connected&nbsp; by the word&nbsp; 'or'.&nbsp; This latter device was adopted. in sections 75&nbsp; and&nbsp; 191&nbsp; of the Corporation Law."<br><br>The citation&nbsp; from 3 Benito, Derecho Mercantil, p. 245, invoked in the&nbsp; majority&nbsp; decision, to&nbsp; the effect that the duration of a sodedad anonima is of interest both to its members and to third persons, is&nbsp; clearly an authority for our&nbsp; conclusions that&nbsp; the extension&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp; term is in relation "to the rights of members thereof as between themselves."&nbsp; Section 191 does not say that a <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i> shall be governed by the&nbsp; provisions of the Corporation&nbsp; Law when the&nbsp; matter involved affects not only "the rights of members thereof as between themselves" but also "the public and public officials."<br><br>We are also&nbsp; of the opinion.that alternatively,&nbsp; under section 75, the petitioner may elect to reform and organize under the&nbsp; Corporation Law,&nbsp; transferring all&nbsp; its corporate&nbsp; , interests to the&nbsp; new corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to the ruling of the respondent, we are convinced that, as no period was fixed within which it should exercise&nbsp; the&nbsp; option&nbsp; either of continuing as&nbsp; a sodedad&nbsp; anonima or reforming and organizing under the Corporation Law, the petitioner was entitled to have its articles of incorporation and by-laws presented respectively on June 22&nbsp; and July 22, 1953, registered by.the respondent.&nbsp; Section 75 did not take&nbsp; away petitioner's right to exhaust its term as a sodedad cmdnimu, already vested before the enactment&nbsp; of the Corporation Law, but merely&nbsp; granted it&nbsp; the&nbsp; choice to organize as a regular corppration, instead&nbsp; of&nbsp; extending&nbsp; its life as a sodedad anonima.&nbsp; The only limitation imposed is that prescribed in section 191, namely, that if a <i>sodedad anonima</i> elects&nbsp; to continue its business as&nbsp; such, it&nbsp; shall be governed by the prior law in relation to its organization and method of transacting business&nbsp; and to the rights of its members as between themselves,&nbsp; and&nbsp; by&nbsp; the provisions of the&nbsp; Corporation Law as to its relations to the public and public officials.&nbsp; If&nbsp; the intention were to fix a period for reformation, the law would&nbsp; have expressly so provided, in the&nbsp; same way that section 19 fixes two years during which a&nbsp; corporation&nbsp; should formally&nbsp; organize&nbsp; and commence the transaction of its business,&nbsp; otherwise its corporate&nbsp; powers would cease; section 77&nbsp; fixes three&nbsp; years from the dissolution of a&nbsp; corporation within which it ,may clear and settle&nbsp; its affairs; and section 78&nbsp; fixes the same period of three years within which a corporation may convey&nbsp; its properties to a trustee&nbsp; for the&nbsp; benefit of its stockholders and other interested persons.<br><br>It is not correct to&nbsp; argue&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; is&nbsp; not entitled to elect to continue as a, <i>sociedad anonima</i> and at the same time reform and organize as a regular corporation, because when it continued as a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span> after the passage of the Corporation Law and during its full term of fifty years, it&nbsp; merely exercised&nbsp; a iright&nbsp; it theretofore had;&nbsp; and the&nbsp; petitioner can. be said&nbsp; properly&nbsp; to have availed itself of the other option only when in June 1953 it filed&nbsp; the necessary papers&nbsp; of incorporation&nbsp; under&nbsp; the Corporation Law.&nbsp; It is likewise not accurate to contend that, as the respondent&nbsp; ruled,&nbsp; the petitioner could reform as and be a&nbsp; regular corporation&nbsp; at most&nbsp; only for&nbsp; the remainder of its term as a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>.&nbsp; Section 75, in allowing a&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad&nbsp; anonima</span> to reform and&nbsp; organize under the Corporation Law. also authorizes the transfer of its corporate&nbsp; interests to&nbsp; the new&nbsp; corporation.&nbsp; This "new" corporation should have the advantage of the prescribed maximum duration, regardless of the original term of the old or substituted entity. There is no basis for&nbsp; the criticism that, if the petitioner were allowed to exhaust its full term&nbsp; as a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad anonima</span>, and afterwards to reform as a regular corporation for another fifty years, it would have a span of life twice as long as that granted to corporations organized&nbsp; under the Corporation&nbsp; Law.&nbsp; The simple reason is that the petitioner was already a corporate entity before the enactment of the. Corporation Law, with a fixed duration under its original articles&nbsp; of association. It was clearly not in parity with any corporation organized under and coming&nbsp; into existence after&nbsp; the&nbsp; eff ectivity of the Corporation Law which has no choice1&nbsp; on the matter and can&nbsp; therefore have only&nbsp; the prerogative&nbsp; granted&nbsp; by said law,—no more no less.<br><br>The respondent has suggested that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioner, if desirous&nbsp; of&nbsp; continuing its business, may organize a new corporation—a suggestion which need not be made because no one&nbsp; would&nbsp; probably think&nbsp; of denying&nbsp; it that right. But we cannot see any cogent reason or practical purpose for the suggestion.&nbsp; In the first place, the filing of petitioner's&nbsp; articles&nbsp; of incorporation and&nbsp; by-laws in July, 1953, in effect amounted to the formation of a new corporation.&nbsp; To require&nbsp; more is to give greater&nbsp; importance to form&nbsp; than to substance.&nbsp; In&nbsp; the second place, the public and public officials may not as&nbsp; a matter of fact be adversely affected&nbsp; by allowing&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; to reform,&nbsp; instead of requiring it technically to&nbsp; form a&nbsp; new corporation. It will acquire no greater rights or obligations by simple reformation than by newly organizing another corporation. Conversely,&nbsp; the&nbsp; public and public officials will acquire no greater benefit or control by requiring the petitioner to form, a new corporation, than&nbsp; by allowing&nbsp; it to reform. And as already stated, whatever interest the public&nbsp; and public officials may have in determining the&nbsp; duration of a <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad&nbsp; anonima</span> or any corporation for that matter, is amply protected by registration in the Securities&nbsp; and Exchange Commission.<br><br>The respondent and the intervenor, Consolidated Mines, Inc., have tried to show that&nbsp; the petitioner holds or owns interests in&nbsp; eight mining companies, in violation of section 13,&nbsp; subsection 5 of the Corporation Law, in that it has operating contracts with the interyenor and seven other mining companies,&nbsp; besides&nbsp; owning the majority shares in Balatoc Mining Co.&nbsp;&nbsp; This matter has not merited any attention or favorable comment&nbsp; in the majority decision, and rightly of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, we may observe that the alleged violation was not the subject of any finding by the respondent, nor relied upon in his order&nbsp; of denial;&nbsp; that the petitioner&nbsp; has denied the charge; that the holding by the petitioner&nbsp; of shares of&nbsp; stock&nbsp; in Balatoc Mining Co., if really&nbsp; illegal, may&nbsp; look into&nbsp; only in a <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto </span>proceeding instituted by the Government; that at any rate the petitioner has always been ready and willing to dispose of said shares and, in a proper proceeding,&nbsp; it should be given&nbsp; reasonable time to&nbsp; do so,&nbsp; as this Court&nbsp; gave&nbsp; the Philippine Sugar Estates a period of six months after final decision within which to "liquidate, dissolve and separate absolutely in&nbsp; every&nbsp; respect&nbsp; and&nbsp; in all of&nbsp; its&nbsp; relations, complained of&nbsp; in the petition, with the Tayabas Land Company"&nbsp; (Government <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.&nbsp;</span> Philippine Sugar&nbsp; Estates Co., 38 Phil.,&nbsp; 15).<br><br>With&nbsp; special&nbsp; reference&nbsp; to the&nbsp; intervenor, it may be of some moment to know the antecedents and nature of business relations existing&nbsp; between&nbsp; it&nbsp; and the petitioner, at least to&nbsp; demonstrate&nbsp; the righteousness&nbsp; of the position of one or the&nbsp; other ,even from&nbsp; a factual point of view. The following&nbsp; excerpts from "Petitioner's Reply to a portion of Intervenor's Brief" are in point:<blockquote>"What has happened in our&nbsp; case is that&nbsp; prior to the execution of the Operating Agreement&nbsp; of July 9, 1934, the stockholders, directors, and officers of&nbsp; the intervenor,&nbsp; Consolidated Mines, Inc., did&nbsp; not want to risk one&nbsp; centavo of&nbsp; their own&nbsp; funds for the development of their chrome&nbsp; ore mining claims in Zambales province, and proposed to&nbsp; the petitioner herein,&nbsp; Benguet&nbsp; Consolidated&nbsp; Mining&nbsp; Company, to explore,&nbsp; develop and operate their&nbsp; mining claims, Benguet to furnish all the funds that might be&nbsp; necessary, and to explore, develop, mine and concentrate&nbsp; and market 'all the&nbsp; pay. ore&nbsp; fourid on or ivitthin paid claims or properties',&nbsp; the infcervonar, Consolidated Mines, Inc.,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the petitioner,&nbsp; Benguet Consolidated Mining Company, after the latter had reimbursed itself fo:q all its advances, to divide half and&nbsp; half the excess of receipts cter disbursements.&nbsp;&nbsp; Benguet&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; to it,&nbsp; and&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; approximately fihree million pesos, one-half thereof before the&nbsp; war,&nbsp; and the other half after the war&nbsp; (the Intervenor's properties having been destroyed during the&nbsp; war).&nbsp;&nbsp; Paragraph XII&nbsp; of the&nbsp; interyenor's&nbsp; complaint in the civil&nbsp; action 'instituted&nbsp; by it against&nbsp; Benguet in the Court of&nbsp; First .Instance of&nbsp; Manila, .No.&nbsp; 18938, and&nbsp; to which&nbsp; counsel for the&nbsp; intervenor, refer in page&nbsp; 5&nbsp; of their brief, makes mention of the large sums of money that Benguet advanced, as follows:<br><br>'Initial advances&nbsp; amounting to&nbsp; approximately P1,500,000) made by defendant during&nbsp; the&nbsp; first phases&nbsp; of said Operating&nbsp; Agreement which had been fully reimbursed to it before the war, and&nbsp; of the,&nbsp; amounts&nbsp;&nbsp; likewise . advanced by&nbsp; it&nbsp;&nbsp; (Benguet)&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; rehabilitation amounting to close P1,500,000,00.<br><br>"While&nbsp; Benguet&nbsp; risked and poured approximately three million pesos (P3,000,000)&nbsp; into the venture,&nbsp; and&nbsp; while&nbsp; Benguet was looking for,. and establishing,&nbsp; a market for&nbsp; intervenor's chrome&nbsp; ore, the intervenor,&nbsp; Consolidated Mines, Inc., considered the said Operating Agreement&nbsp; of July&nbsp; 9, 1934, as valid. Now that Benguet's&nbsp; efforts have been crowned with success, and&nbsp; Benguet&nbsp; has established&nbsp; a market for&nbsp; intervenor's chrome ore, the&nbsp; intervenor. claims that its&nbsp; said&nbsp; Operating Agreement of July 9,&nbsp; 1934, with the petitioner, Benguet,&nbsp; is&nbsp; contrary, to. law because&nbsp; Benguet has become interested in intervenor's&nbsp; chrome&nbsp; ore&nbsp; mining claims&nbsp; (although the agreement esspressly&nbsp; states that Benguet has no interest therein),&nbsp; and .objects to the registration of the documents&nbsp; which Benguct filed with the respondent Securities&nbsp; and&nbsp; Exchange&nbsp; Commissioner,&nbsp; extending&nbsp; its life as a&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">sociedad&nbsp; anonima</span>, and reforming&nbsp; itself as a corporation, in accordance with, the provisions of section 75&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Corporation Law.<br><br>"Under the foregoing&nbsp; facts, the&nbsp; intervenor,&nbsp; Consolidated&nbsp; Mines, . Inc., can&nbsp; not be heard&nbsp; to complain&nbsp; against&nbsp; Benguet.&nbsp; No court can&nbsp; give&nbsp; now&nbsp; a helping&nbsp; hand&nbsp; to&nbsp; the intervenorf&nbsp; which&nbsp; claims that Benguet no longer lives,&nbsp; and&nbsp; wants to keep&nbsp; for&nbsp; itself&nbsp; all the products of Benguet's&nbsp; 'efforts&nbsp; after the&nbsp; latter risked&nbsp; into the venture&nbsp; approximately&nbsp; three million&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; (P3,000,000)."<br></blockquote>The foregoing considerations&nbsp; may not constitute a legal justification fdr ruling that the petitioner should be allowed either to&nbsp; extend&nbsp; its life as a&nbsp; <i>sociedad&nbsp; anonima</i> or&nbsp; to reform and organize under the provisions&nbsp; of the Corporation Law,&nbsp; but they may&nbsp; aid in resolving&nbsp; in petitioner's favor,and doubt as to the clarity or definiteness of sections 75 and 191&nbsp; of the Corporation Law regarding&nbsp; its right to&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; either&nbsp; option in the manner claimed by. it.<br><br></md>The same&nbsp; result&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; arrived at&nbsp; H,&nbsp; in&nbsp; addition, we bear&nbsp; in&nbsp;
mind the&nbsp; possible&nbsp; economic harm&nbsp; that may biv brought about by the
affirmance of the order complained of. This aspect is adequately,&nbsp;
touched in petitioner's brief, as follows:<br><md by-laws="" with="" respondent ="" commissioner="" of="" securities="" and="" exchange="" registration;="" but="" the="" latter="" refused="" to="" accept="" them="" as="" belatedly="" made.=""><blockquote><table border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="5%"><div align="justify">"1.&nbsp; <br></div></td> <td colspan="3" valign="top"> <div align="justify">A loss of employment in the Baguio district by about 4,000&nbsp; Filipino awd a loss of direct living from the Benguet operation&nbsp; Supplied to 20,000, that is the 1,000 employed&nbsp; and their dependents.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top" width="6%"><br></td> <td valign="top" width="5%"><br></td> <td valign="top" width="84%"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">"(a)&nbsp;</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="justify">This "would bo&nbsp; calamity to the district of the highest depression which could&nbsp; react ail fiver the Philippine Islands.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">"2.</div></td> <td colspan="3" valign="top"> <div align="justify">Losses of direct&nbsp; and indirect&nbsp; taxes to the&nbsp; Philippine Government in an extremely large yearly amount.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">"3. </div></td> <td colspan="3" valign="top"><div align="justify">No one would be able to .continue&nbsp; the Benguet and Balatoc mines in&nbsp; operation should&nbsp; a&nbsp; liquidation of Benguet take place because the&nbsp; net profits after&nbsp; labor and&nbsp; material ccsts&nbsp; and taxes&nbsp; jr.&nbsp; the last&nbsp;&nbsp; two years or&nbsp; more&nbsp; from the gold mining operations have not warranted&nbsp; their continued operation as independent units.&nbsp; The profits in 1953&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly do not warrant it.
