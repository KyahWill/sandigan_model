Francisco's answer of April 13, 1953 and amended answer of September 9, 1953 herein referred to as forming part of this agreed statement of facts, all of which should be considered together with the controverted facts which shall be separately proven by the herein contending parties."<br></blockquote>At the hearing, the petitioner presented proof that the criminal charges against him were dismissed by the fiscal's Office and that there were then at least two employees receiving F5,100 and P6,000 who were not civil service eligibles.<br><br>From the judgment of the trial court, tbe respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals. In the meantime, the respondents appointed the petitioner as Supervisor of Field Team, by reason of which the latter filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that said appointment— a reinstatement virtually,—is already a compliance with the appealed judgment and the case should therefore be considered closed. The Court of Appeals denied the motion, but, upon discovering that purely questions of law are involved elevated the appeal to this Court.<br><br>The question before us is: was petitioner's separation from the service due to lack of civil service eligibility (although he had already taken the first grade examination but had not received the results thereof), to give way to the promotional appointment of another who is an eligible, legal? It is not controverted,that the petitioner was not a civil service eligible when he was appointed Acting Chief of the Legal Investigation Section of the Philippine Veterans Board and that his appointment was temporary and therefore governed by section 632 of the Revised Administrative Code which provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 682. <i>Temporary and emergency employees</i>.—Temporary appointment without examination and certification by the Commissioner of Civil Service or his local representative shall not be made to competitive position in any case, except when the public interests so require, and then only upon the prior authorization of the Commissioner of Civil Service; and any temporary appointment so authorized shall continue only for such period not exceeding three months as may be necessary to make appointment through certification of eligibles, and in no case shall extend beyond thirty days from receipt by the chief of the bureau or office of the Commissioner's certification of eligibles; PROVIDED, That in the case of teachers such temporary appointment may be authorized to continue for a period of not exceeding one school semester, or until eligibles who meet the desired qualifications are certified for employment, but not sooner than the beginning of a school semester. Violation of these provisions will render such chief of the bureau or office responsible for the payment of salary to such person employed contrary to law as hereinafter provided. It shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Ciyil Serviec to provide a register of eligibles as soon as practicable prior to the expiration of the period of temporary employment."<br></blockquote>The foregoing provision is explicit on the term of a temporary, namely, three months. The petitioner should have ceased in office as Chief of the Legal Investigation Section of the Philippine Veterans Board three months after his appointment on October 1, 1949, After the expiration, of said period, he could have been removed at will by the appointing power; his continuance thereafter as a temporary employee was « only an extension of grace. We have already upheld the "legality of such kind of dismissal in the case of Leonilo Pafia, et al. vs. City Mayor Medina, et al., (94 Phil., 103; 50 Off. Gaz., 146) when we said:<br><blockquote>"In accordance with Section 682 of the Revised Administrative I Code, when a position in the classified service is filled by one who is not a qualified civil service eligible, his appointment is limited to the period necessary to enable the appointing: officer to recure a eivil ^service eligible, qualified for the position, and in no case is such temporary appointment for a longer period than 3 months. As petitioners herein were not civil service eligibles at the time of their appointment, and it does not appear that they have since then qualified for the positions they' are holding, their respective appointments were only for periods of 3 months and not more. (Citing dase of Orais, et al. vs. Ribo et al., L-4945, October 28, 1953.)"<br></blockquote>In the case at bar the petitioner was impliedly dismissed by the appointment of an eligible to the position in controversy.<br><blockquote>"Sec. 186. <i>Removal by Act of Appointing Successor</i>—The general rule seems to be that where an officer may be removed by a superior officer at the latter's pleasure, the act of removal is accomplished merely by the appointing of another officer in his place, so far as the officer himself is concerned, but in order to render the removal effective in all cases, the incumbent must be notified.<br><br>"Thins, where the law gives a court power of appointing its own clerks and does not prescribe any form in which this shall&nbsp; be done or in which an appointinee may be removed, the mere appointment of a successor would, per se, be a removal of the prior incumbents, so far at least as his rights were concerned. Similarly, it has been held that express removal from office is not necessary to deprive the secretary of a mayor of the right to the salary, where he holds his position only during the mayor's pleasure, and a new secretary has been appointed and assumed the duties of the office." (43 Am. Jur. 33-34.)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's claim that after becoming a civil service eligible on September 5, 1951, he was entitled to a permanent appointment to the position from which he was removed, is not sanctioned by any law or regulation. The power to appoint is in essence discretionary on the part of the proper authority, in this case the head of the department. The appointing power has the right of choice which he may exercise freely according to his judgment, deciding for himself who is best qualified for any competitive position in the Civil Service. Mere certification as a civil service eligible does not amount to an appointment. The Civil Service Commission does not insure any appointment; it only certifies an eligible to be possessed of the qualification as required for a position classified under its rules. (19 Am. &amp; Eng. Ecy. Law 423; Hurd's Rev. St. 1909, c. 24a.)<br><br>In cases decided by American courts, it had been held that a temporary appointment can never ripen into one of permanence and that the acceptance of a temporary appointment does not preclude the appointing power from all opportunity to select an employee whose position is to be permanent. (Darling vs. McGuire, 129 N. Y. Supp. 385; People vs. Escannell, 66 N. Y. Supp. 182.)<br><br>Petitioner's removal from the service effective at the close of office hours on August 3, 1951, being legal, he is not entitled to the emoluments thereof after said date.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed decision is hereby reversed and the petition for mandamus instituted btf the petitioner dismissed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A.f BavMsta Angelo, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia</i>, and <i>Felix, JJ</i>., concur.</div>
