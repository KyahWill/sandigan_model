				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The plaintiff is the owner of an apartment known and identified as No. 2227 
Rizal Avenue, Manila. This apartment has been occupied by the defendant since 
September, 1940, under a verbal contract of lease calling for a monthly rental 
of P35 payable in advance, which was raised by the plaintiff to P44 in June, 
1945. On April 2, 1945, and again on July 2, 1945, the plaintiff gave notice to 
the defendant for him to vacate the premises. Defendant's failure to do so led 
to the filing, on July 9, 1945, by the plaintiff of an action for ejectment in 
the Municipal Court of Manila which, after trial, handed down a decision in 
favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed, but the Court of First Instance 
of Manila, in vttieh the parties submitted a stipulation of facts, rendered a 
judgment for restitution and the payment of the monthly rental of P44 beginning 
June 1, 1945.</p>
<p>Appealing again, the defendant-through his counsel-argues that the action for 
ejectment was prematurely instituted and that, at least on equitable 
considerations, he should be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 689 provides that "A lease for the 
occupation as dwelling of a building or part thereof which is not a room or 
rooms of an hotel, which does not specify any term, shall be considered of six 
months' duration counted from the date of occupation by virtue of said lease at 
the option of the lessee." It is now the theory of the appellant that since the 
period of his lease was not specified, he has the right to remain as lessee for 
at least six months from June 1, 1945, when the rental was increased to P44-an 
act which resulted in a novation of the original lease.</p>
<p>Counsel for the appellant is mistaken. As the lease did not have a fixed 
term, it should be considered as one from month to month (the rental being 
payable monthly) and to have ceased, without the necessity of special notice, 
upon the expiration of every month. (Article 1581, Civil Code.) Even if, as 
contended by the appellant, a novation took place when the appellee increased 
the rent in June, 1945, the lease was still monthly and terminated after said 
month. Appellee's election to end the lease was unmistakably made known to the 
appellant when, on July 2, 1945, the latter was asked to vacate. Consequently, 
after June, 1945, there was no longer any lease that could be affected by 
section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 689, which, was enacted only on October 15, 
1945, even assuming that said law is applicable to a legal relation that came 
into being prior to its enactment.</p>
<p>From the equitable viewpoint, appellant's case cannot also prosper. He might 
have been an old tenant now facing the difficulty of finding another house, but 
this circumstance cannot nullify the legal rights of the appellee and his family 
who have been admittedly "compelled to live upon the charity of some friend who 
generously offered them temporary shelter in his house which is overcrowded, to 
say the least."</p>
<p>The appealed judgment is affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered.</p>
<p><em>Pablo, Perfecto, Hilado, </em>and <em>Padilla, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
