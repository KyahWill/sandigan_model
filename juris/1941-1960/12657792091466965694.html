<p>Opposing the petition, her surviving husband Ildefonso Yap asserted that the 
deceased had not left any will, nor executed any testament during her 
lifetime.</p>
<p>After hearing the parties and considering their evidence, the Hon. Ramon R. 
San Jose, Judge,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> refused to probate the 
alleged will. A seventy-page motion for reconsideration failed. Hence this 
appeal. </p>
<p>The will itself was not presented. Petitioner tried to establish its contents 
and due execution by the statements in open court of Felina Esguerra, Primitivo 
Reyes, Socorro Olarte and Rosario Gan Jimenez, whose testimonies may be 
summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Sometime in 1950 after her last trip abroad, Felicidad Esguerra mentioned to 
her first cousin, Vicente Esguerra, her desire to make a will. She confided 
however that it would Jbe useless if her husband discovered or knew about it. 
Vicente consulted with Fausto E. Gan, nephew of Felicidad, who was then 
preparing for the bar examinations. The latter replied it could be done without 
any witness, provided the document was entirely in her handwriting, signed and 
dated by her. Vicente Esguerra lost no time in transmitting the information, and 
on the strength of it, in the morning of November 5,1951, in her residence at 
Juan Luna Street, Manila, Felicidad wrote, signed and dated a holographic will 
substantially of the tenor above transcribed, in the presence of her niece, 
Felina Esguerra (daughter of Vicente), who was invited to read it. In the 
afternoon of that day, Felicidad was visited by a distant relative, Primitivo 
Reyes, and she allowed him to read the will in the presence of Felina Esguerra, 
who again read it.</p>
<p>Nine days later, he had other visitors: Socorro Olarte a cousin, and Rosario 
Gan Jimenez, a niece. To these she showed the will, again in the presence of 
Felina Esguerra, who read it for the third time. </p>
<p>When on November 19, 1951, Felicidad was confined at the U.S.T. Hospital for 
her last illness, she entrusted the said will, which was contained in a purse, 
to Felina Esguerra. But a few hours later, Ildefonso Yap, her husband, asked 
Felina for the purse; and being afraid of him by reason of his well-known 
violent temper, she delivered it to him. Thereafter, in the same day, Ildefonso 
Yap returned the purse to Felina, only to demand it the next day shortly before 
the death of Felicidad. Again, Felina handed it to him but not before she had 
taken the purse to the toilet, opened it and read the will for the last 
time<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
<p>From the oppositor's proof it appears that Felicidad Esguerra had been 
suffering from heart disease for several years before her death; that she had 
been treated by prominent physicians, Dr. Agerico Sison, Dr. Agustin Liboro and 
others; that in May 1950 husband and wife journeyed to the United States wherein 
for several weeks she was treated for the disease; that thereafter she felt well 
and after visiting interesting places, the couple returned to this country in 
August 1950. However, her ailment recurred, she suffered several attacks, the 
most serious of which happened in the early morning of the first Monday of 
November 1951 (Nov. 5). The whole household was surprised and alarmed, even the 
teachers of the Harvardian Colleges occupying the lower floors and owned by the 
Yap spouses. Physician's help was hurriedly called, and Dr. Tanjuaquio arrived 
at about 8:00 a.m., found the patient hardly "breathing, lying in bed, her head 
held high by her husband. Injections and oxygen were administered. Following the 
doctor's advice the patient stayed in bed, and did nothing the whole day, her 
husband and her personal attendant, Mrs. Bantique, constantly at her side. These 
two persons swore that Mrs. Felicidad Esguerra Yap made no will, and could have 
made no will on that day. </p>
<p>The trial judge refused to credit the petitioner's evidence for several 
reasons, the most important of which were these: (a) if according to his 
evidence, the decedent wanted to keep her will a secret, so that her husband 
would not know it, it is strange she executed it in the presence of Felina 
Esguerra, knowing as she did that witnesses were unnecessary; (b) in the absence 
of a showing that Felina was a confidant of the decedent it is hard to believe 
that the latter would have allowed the former to see and read the will several 
times; (c) it is improbable that the decedent would have permitted Primitivo 
Reyes, Rosario Gan Jimenez and Socorro Olarte to read her will, when she 
precisely wanted its contents to remain a secret during her lifetime; (d) it is 
also improbable that her purpose being to conceal the will from her husband she 
would carry it around, even to the hospital, in her purse which could for one 
reason or another be opened by her husband; (e) if it is true that the husband 
demanded the purse from Felina in the U.S.T. Hospital and that the will was 
there, it is hard to believe that he returned it without destroying the will, 
the theory of the petitioner being precisely that the will was executed behind 
his back for fear he will destroy it. </p>
<p>In the face of these improbabilities, the trial judge had to accept the 
oppositor's evidence that Felicidad did not and could not have executed such 
holographic will. </p>
<p>In this appeal, the major portion of appellant's brief discussed the 
testimony of the oppositor and of his witnesses in a vigorous effort to 
discredit them. It appears that the same arguments, or most of them, were 
presented in the motion to reconsider; but they failed to induce the court a quo 
to change its mind. The oppositor's brief, a on the other hand, aptly answers 
the criticisms. We deem it unnecessary to go over the same matters, because in 
our opinion the case should be decided not on the weakness of the opposition but 
on the strength of the evidence of the petitioner, who has the burden of proof. 
</p>
<p>The Spanish Civil Code permited the execution of holographic wills along with 
other forms. The Code of Civil Procedure (Act 190) approved August 7, 1901, 
adopted only one form, thereby repealing the other forms, including holographic 
wills. </p>
<p>The New Civil Code effective in 1960 revived holographic wills in its arts. 
810-814. "A person may execute a holographic will which must be entirely 
written, dated, and sigrned by the hand of the testator himself. It is subject 
to no other form and may be made in or out of the Philippines, and need not be 
witnessed." </p>
<p>This is indeed a radical departure from the form and solemnities provided for 
wills under Act 190, which for fifty years (from 1901 to 1950) required wills to 
be subscribed by the testator and three credible witnesses in <i>each</i> and 
<i>every page</i>; such witnesses to attest to the number of sheets used and to 
the fact that the testator signed in their presence and that they signed in the 
presence of the testator and of each other.</p>
<p>The object of such requirements it has been said, is to close the door 
against bad faith and fraud, to prevent substitution of wills, to guarantee 
their truth and authenticity (Abangan <i>vs.</i> Abangan, 40 Phil., 476) and to 
avoid that those who have no right to succeed the testator would succeed him and 
be benefited with the probate of same. (Mendoza <i>vs.</i> Pilapil, 40 Off. 
Gaz., 1855), However, formal imperfections may be brushed aside when 
authenticity of the instrument is duly proved. (Rodriguez <i>vs.</i> Yap, 40 
Off. Gaz. Ist Supp. No. 3 p. 194.) </p>
<p>Authenticity and due execution is the dominant requirement to be fulfilled 
when such will is submitted to the courts for allowance. For that purpose the 
testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses would be sufficient, if there is 
no opposition (Sec. 5, Rule 77). If there is, the three must testify, if 
available. (Cabang <i>vs.</i> Delfinado, 34 Phil., 291; Tolentino <i>vs.</i> 
Francisco, 57 Phil., 742). From the testimony of such witnesses (and of other 
additional witnesses) the court may form its opinion as to the genuineness and 
authenticity of the testament, and the circumstances of its due execution. </p>
<p>Now, in the matter of holographic wills, no such guaranties of truth and 
veracity are demanded, since as stated they need no witnesses; provided 
however, that they are "entirely written, dated, and signed by the hand of the 
testator himself." The law, it is reasonable to suppose, regards <i>the document 
itself</i> as material proof of authenticity, and as its own safeguard, since it 
could at any time, be demonstrated to be—or not to be—in the hands of the 
testator himself. "In the probate of a holographic will" says the New Civil 
Code, "it shall be necessary that at least one witness who knows the handwriting 
and signature of the testator explicitly declare that the will and the signature 
are in the handwriting of the testator. If the will is contested, at least three 
such witnesses shall be required. In the absence of any such witnesses, 
(familiar with decedent's handwriting) and if the court deem it necessary, 
expert testimony may be resorted to." </p>
<p>The witnesses so presented do not need to have seen the execution of the 
holographic will. They may be mistaken in their opinion of the handwriting, or 
they may deliberately lie in affirming it is in the testator's hand. However, 
the oppositor may present other witnesses who also know the testator's 
handwriting, or some expert witnesses, who after comparing the will with other 
writings or letters of the deceased, have come to the conclusion that such will 
has not been written by the hand of the deceased. (Sec. 50, Rule 123). And the 
court, in view of such contradictory testimony may use its own visual sense, and 
decide in the face of the document, whether the will submitted to it has indeed 
been written by the testator. </p>
<p>Obviously, when the will itself is not submitted, these <i>means of 
opposition</i>, and <i>of assessing</i> <i>the evidence</i> are not available. 
And then the<i> only guaranty</i> of authenticity<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[3]</sup></span>—the testator's handwriting—has disappeared. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, the question presents itself,<i> may a holographic will be 
probated upon the testimony of witnesses</i> who have allegedly seen it and who 
declare that it was in the handwriting of the testator? How can the oppositor 
prove that such document was not in the testator's handwriting? His witnesses 
who know testator's handwriting have not examined it. His experts can not 
testify, because there is no way to compare the alleged testament with other 
documents admittedly, or proven to be, in the testator's hand. The oppositor 
will, therefore, be caught between the upper millstone of his lack of knowledge 
of the will or the form thereof, and the nether millstone of his inability to 
prove its falsity. Again the proponent's witnesses may be honest and truthful; 
but they may have been shown a faked document, and having no interest to check 
the authenticity thereof have taken no pains to examine and compare. Or they may 
be perjurers boldly testifying, in the knowledge that none could convict them of 
perjury, because no one could prove that they have not "been shown" a document 
which <i>they believed</i> was in the handwriting of the deceased. Of course, 
the competency of such perjured witnesses to testify as to the handwriting could 
be tested by exhibiting to them other writings sufficiently similar to those 
written by the deceased; but what witness or lawyer would not foresee such a 
move and prepare for it? His knowledge of the handwriting established, the 
witness (or witnesses) could simply stick to his statement: he has seen and read 
a document which he believed was in the deceased's handwriting. And the court 
and the oppositor would practically be at the mercy of such witness (or 
witnesses) not only as to the execution, but also as to<i> the contents</i> of 
the will. Does the law permit such a situation? </p>
<p>The Rules of Court, (Rule 77) approved in 1940, allow proof (and probate) of 
a lost or destroyed will by secondary evidence—the testimony of witnesses, in 
lieu of the original document. Yet such Rules could not have contemplated 
holographic wills which could not then be validly made here. (See also Sec. 46, 
Rule 123; Art. 830—New Civil Code.) </p>
<p>Could Rule 77 be extended, by analogy, to holographic wills? </p>
<p>Spanish commentators agree that one of the greatest objections to the 
holographic will is that it may be lost or stolen <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[4]</sup></span>—an implied admission that such loss or theft 
renders it useless. " </p>
<p>This must be so, because the Civil Code requires <i>it</i> to be protocoled 
and presented to the judge, (Art. 689) who shall subscribe it and require its 
identity to be established by the three witnesses who depose that they have no 
reasonable doubt that<i> the will</i> was written by the testator (Art. 691). 
And if the judge considers that the identity of the will has been proven he 
shall order that it be filed (Art. 693). All these, imply presentation of the 
will itself. Art. 692 bears the same implication, to a greater degree. It 
requires that the surviving spouse and the legitimate ascendants and descendants 
be summoned so that they may make "any statement they may desire to submit with 
respect to the authenticity of the will." As it is universally admitted that the 
holographic will is usually done by the testator and by himself alone, to 
prevent others from knowing either its execution or its contents, the above 
article 692 could not have the idea of simply permitting such relatives to state 
whether they know of the will, but whether <i>in the face of the document itself 
</i>they think the testator wrote it. Obviously, this they can't do unless 
<i>the will itself</i> is presented to the Court and to them. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the intention of the law is to give the near relatives the 
choice of either complying with the will if they think it authentic, or to 
oppose it, if they think it spurious.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[5]</sup></span> 
Such purpose is frustrated when the document is not presented for their 
examination. If it be argued that such choice is not essential, because anyway 
the relatives may oppose, the answer is that their opposition will be at a 
distinct disadvantage, and they have <i>the right and privilege</i> to comply 
with the will, if genuine, <i>a right which they</i> should not be denied by 
withholding inspection thereof from them. </p>
<p>We find confirmation of these ideas—about exhibition of the document 
itself—in the decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of June 5, 1925, which 
<i>denied </i>protocolization or probate to a document containing testamentary 
dispositions in the handwriting of the deceased, but apparently mutilated,<i> 
the signature and some words having been torn from it</i>. Even in the face of 
allegations and testimonial evidence (which was controverted), ascribing the 
mutilation to the opponents of the will. The aforesaid tribunal declared that, 
in accordance with the provision of the Civil Code (Spanish) the will itself, 
whole and unmutilated, must be presented; otherwise, it shall produce no effect. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Considerando que sentado lo anterior, y estableciendose en el parrafo 
segundo del articulo 688 del Codigo civil, que para que sea valido el testamento 
olografo debera estar escrito todo el y firmado por testador, con expression del 
año, mes y dia en que se otorque, resulta evidente que para la validez y 
eflcacia de esos testamentos, no basta la demostracion mas o menos cumplida de 
que cuando se <i>otorgaron se llenaron todos esos requisites, sino que de la 
expresada redaccion el precepto legal</i>, y por el tiempo en que el verbo se 
emplea, se <i>desprende la necesidad de que el documento se encuentre</i> en 
dichas condidones en el momento de ser presentado a <i>la Autoridad 
competente</i>, para su adveraci6n y protocolizacion; y como consecuencia 
ineludible de ello, forzoso es affirmar <i>que el de autos carece de validez y 
aficacia,</i> por no estar firmado por el testador, <i>cualquiera que sea la 
causa de la falta, de firma,</i> y sin perjuieio de las acetones que puedan 
ejercitar los perjudicados, Men para pedir indemnizacion por el perjuicio a la 
persona culpable, si la hubiere, o su castigo en via criminal si procediere, por 
<i>constituir dicha omision un defecto insubsanable </i>* * *." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>This holding aligns with the ideas on holographic wills in the Fuero Juzgo, 
admittedly the basis of the Spanish Civil Code provisions on the matter.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[6]</sup></span> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"PRECEDENTES LEGALES—Fuero Juzgo, libro segxmdo, titulo V, ley 15—E depues 
que los herederos e sus fijos ovieren esta manda, fasta xxx annos muestrenla al 
obispo de la tierra, o al juez fasta VI meses y el obispo o el juez tomen otros 
tales tres escritos, que fuesen fechos por su mano daquel que fizo la manda; e 
por aquellos escriptos, si semjara la letra de la manda, sea confirmada la 
manda. E depues que todo esto fuere connoscido, el obispo o el juez, o otras 
testimonios confirmen el escripto de la manda otra vez, y en esta manera vala la 
manda." (Art. 689, Scaevola—Codigo Civil.)</p></blockquote>
<p>(According to the Fuero above, the will itself must be compared with 
specimens of the testators handwriting.) </p>
<p>All of which can only mean: the courts will not distribute the property of 
the deceased in accordance with his holographic will, unless they are shown his 
handwriting and signature.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[7]</sup></span> </p>
<p>Parenthetically, it may be added that even the French Civil Law considers the 
loss of the holographic will to be fatal. (Planiol y Ripert, Derecho Civil 
Frances, traduccion por Diaz Cruz, 1946, Tomo V, page 555). </p>
<p>Taking all the above circumstances together, we reach the conclusion that the 
execution and the contents of a lost or destroyed holographic will may not be 
proved by the bare testimony of witnesses who have seen and/or read such 
will<span class="style1">.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </span></p>
<p>Under the provisions of Art. 838 of the New Civil Code, we are empowered to 
adopt this opinion as a Rule of Court for the allowance of such holographic 
wills. We hesitate, however, to make this Rule decisive of this controversy, 
simultaneously with its promulgation. Anyway, decision of the appeal may rest on 
the sufficiency, rather the insufficiency, of the evidence presented by 
petitioner Fausto E. Gan. </p>
<p>At this point, before proceeding further, it might be convenient to explain 
why, unlike holographic wills, ordinary wills may be proved by testimonial 
evidence when lost or destroyed. The difference lies in the nature of the wills. 
In the first, the only guarantee of authenticity is the handwriting itself; in 
the second, the testimony of the subscribing or instrumental witnesses (and of 
the notary, now). The loss of the holographic will entails the loss of the only 
medium of proof; if the ordinary will is lost, the subscribing witnesses are 
available to authenticate. </p>
<p>In the case of ordinary wills, it is quite hard to convince three witnesses 
(four with the notary) deliberately to lie. And then their lies could be checked 
and exposed, their whereabouts and acts on the particular day, the likelihood 
that they would be called by the testator, their intimacy with the testator, 
etc. And if they were intimates or trusted friends of the testator they are not 
likely to lend themselves to any fraudulent scheme to distort his wishes. Last 
but not least, they can not receive anything on account of the will. </p>
<p>Whereas in the case of holographic wills, if oral testimony were 
admissible<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[9]</sup></span> only one man could engineer 
the whole fraud this way: after making a clever or passable imitation of the 
handwriting and signature of the deceased, he may contrive to let three honest 
and credible witnesses see and read the forgery; and the latter, having no 
interest, could easily fall for it, and in court they would in all good faith 
affirm its genuineness and authenticity. The will having been lost—the forger 
may have purposely destroyed it in an "accident"—the oppositors have no way to 
expose the trick and the error, because the document itself is not at hand. And 
considering that the holographic will may consist of two or three pages, and 
<span style="font-style: italic;">only one</span> of them need be signed, the substitution of the unsigned pages, which 
may be the most important ones, may go undetected.</p>
<p>If testimonial evidence of holographic wills be permitted, one more 
objectionable feature—feasibility of forgery—would be added to the several 
objections to this kind of wills listed by Castan, Sanchez Roman and Valverde 
and other well-known Spanish Commentators and teachers of Civil Law.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[10]</sup> </span></p>
<p>One more fundamental difference: in the case of a lost will, the three 
subscribing witnesses would be testifying to a fact which they saw, namely 
<i>the act</i> of the testator of subscribing the will; whereas in the case of a 
lost holographic will, the witnesses would testify as<i> to their opinion</i> of 
the handwriting which they allegedly saw, an opinion which can not be tested in 
court, nor directly contradicted by the oppositors, because the handwriting 
itself is not at hand. </p>
<p>Turning now to the evidence presented by the petitioner, we find ourselves 
sharing the trial judge's disbelief. In addition to the dubious circumstances 
described in the appealed decision, we find it hard to believe that the deceased 
should show her will precisely to relatives who had received nothing from it: 
Socorro Olarte and Primitivo Reyes. These could pester her into amending her 
will to give them a share, or threaten to reveal its execution to her husband 
Ildefonso Yap. And this leads to another (point: if she wanted so much to 
conceal the will from her husband, why did she not entrust it to her 
beneficiaries? Opportunity to do so was not lacking: for instance, her husband's 
trip to Davao, a few days after the alleged execution of the will. </p>
<p>In fine, even if oral testimony were admissible to establish and probate a 
lost holographic will, we think the evidence submitted by herein petitioner is 
so tainted with improbabilities and inconsistencies that it fails to measure up 
to that "clear and distinct" proof required by Rule 77, sec. 6.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" class="style1"><sup>[11]</sup></span></p>
<p>Wherefore, the rejection of the alleged will must be sustained. Judgment 
affirmed, with costs against petitioner. </p>

<p>"Holographic wills are peculiarly dangerous in case of persons who have 
written very little. The validity of these wills depends, <span style="font-style: italic;">exclusively</span> on the 
authenticity of handwriting, and if writing standards <span style="font-style: italic;">are not procurable,</span> or not 
contemporaneous, the courts are left to the mercy of the mendacity of witnesses. 
It is <span style="font-style: italic;">questionable</span> whether the <span style="font-style: italic;">recreation</span> of the holographic testament will 
prove wise." (Lawyer's Journal, Nov. 30, 1950, pp. 556-557.)<br></p></div>
