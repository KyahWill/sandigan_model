				<BR><STRONG>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Clemente Talantor and Melquiades Raba were charged with murder before the Court of First Instance of Antique and the bail for each was fixed  by the court at P30,000 as  recommended by the provincial  fiscal. On  April 26,  1956,  after  the arraignment of the accused  at which  both pleaded  not guilty  to the charge, Talantor filed  with the court an urgent motion praying that the amount of the bond fixed for his provisional liberty  be reduced  from P30,000  to P14.000  in  order to enable  him to  go on bail.  While the motion setting the hearing thereof in the morning of the same date contains a notification to the provincial fiscal,  however, the latter was actually notified at 9:40 o'clock in the  morning of the same  day. Despite  this  lack  of due notice,  the  court promptly granted  the  motion  for the reduction of  bail one hour later. <br><br>On April 28, 1956, the provincial fiscal presented a  motion for reconsideration of  the  order granting the reduction of  the bail to P14,000 on the ground  that it is irregular because no proper  notice of the  hearing of the motion for  such  reduction  was given  to him as required by  the rule  to enable him to prove that there exists strong evidence which would warrant the denial  of the motion. The motion was denied,  hence this appeal. <br><br>There is  merit  in this  appeal.   The Rules of Court make it a duty of a movant to  serve notice of his motion on  all  parties  concerned at  least three days before  the hearing thereof  (section 4, Rule 26).  This  requirement is more imperative in a criminal case where a person is accused of a capital offense for in such a  case admission to bail  is a matter of discretion  which can only be exercised after the fiscal  has been heard regarding the nature of  the  evidence  he has  in  his  possession.  Thus,  it is provided that  "When admission  to  bail is a matter of discretion the  court  must  require that reasonable notice of the  hearing  of the application  for bail be given to  the fiscal"  (section 8, Rule 110),  and such notice  is necessary because  "the burden of showing that evidence of guilt is strong is on the  prosecution"  (section   7, Rule  110). Here Talantor  is charged with a capital offense and while the  fiscal fixed a bail of P30.000 for his provisional liberty, its further reduction could not be granted without hearing him because the evidence in his possession may not warrant it. <br><br>It  has  been held that "The determination of whether or not the evidence of guilt is strong is a matter of judicial  discretion.   This discretion, by  the  very nature  of things,  may rightly be  exercised <span style="font-style: italic;">only after the evidence is submitted to the court at  the hearing</span>.  Since the discretion is  directed to the weight of evidence and since evidence cannot properly be weighed if not duly exhibited or produced before the court  (Ramos <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ramos, 45 Phil., 362), it is obvious that a proper exercise of judicial discretion requires  that  the evidence  of guilt be  submitted to the court, the petitioner having the right of  cross-examination  and to introduce his own evidence in  rebuttal." (Ocampo  <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Bernabe, 77 Phil.,  55,  56; Italics  supplied.) <br><br>Considering  that Talantor  did not serve notice  of his motion to reduce  bail  on the  provincial fiscal at least three days before the hearing thereof and the court failed to require that a  reasonable notice thereof be given  to said fiscal,  it is  evident that the court acted improperly in reducing the  bail without giving the fiscal an  opportunity to  be heard. <br><br>We wish however to  state that  the  remedy  the fiscal should have availed of is certiorari and not appeal  considering that the  orders  herein involved are interlocutory in nature  (Rule  41, Section 2). <br><br>The orders of  April  26,  1956 reducing the bond  of Talantor to P14,000, as well  as that approving the bail bond as thus reduced, are hereby set aside. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.  B. L.,  Endencia,</span> and  <span style="font-style: italic;">Felix, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras, C. J.,</span> concurs  in the result. <br><br></div>
