				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners&nbsp; Zosimo Rojas, et&nbsp; al:, claiming&nbsp; to&nbsp; be the registered owners&nbsp; of Lot&nbsp; No. 1, Psu-103916-Amd. originally decreed in their favor in Case&nbsp; No. 398, G.L.R.O. Record No. 53546, have&nbsp; filed&nbsp; this original&nbsp; petition for certiorari&nbsp; seeking&nbsp; to nullify the order of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Cavite dated December 2, 1957, denying&nbsp; their petition to set aside the decision&nbsp; of June 30, 1957 rendered in another and subsequent&nbsp; Land Registration Case No, 323,&nbsp; G.L.R.O. Record No. 12440 decreeing, for the second time, the registration of the same Lot No. 1, this time&nbsp; in favor of the City of Tagaytay.<br><br>At the instance of herein&nbsp; petitioners, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued by this Court on January 24, 1958, restraining the respondent judge from taking further cognizance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforementioned registration case&nbsp; No. 323&nbsp; until further orders from this Court.<br><br>It appears on record that on January 22, 1957, the City of Tagaytay filed&nbsp; with the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of Cavite Land Registration&nbsp; Case No. 323 applying for the registration in its name of 6 parcels of land, among which was Lot&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; plan Psu-103916-Amd., situated in the City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Tagaytay,&nbsp; containing an area of&nbsp; 21,812 square meters and particularly described as follows:<br><blockquote>"Bounded on the&nbsp; Northeast, along line 1-2 by Lot No. 1 of Plan Psu-103916-Amd (should&nbsp; be&nbsp; Psu-103914-Amd). (Proposed Constabulary Barracks);&nbsp; along line&nbsp; 2-3, by Lot 3&nbsp; of Plan Psu103916-Amd.&nbsp; (Portion of Molave&nbsp; Avenue);&nbsp; along 3-4,&nbsp; by&nbsp; property&nbsp; of Congregation&nbsp; de las&nbsp; Beatas&nbsp; de&nbsp; la Virgen&nbsp; Maria;&nbsp; along line 4-5, by property&nbsp; of Honorio Rojas&nbsp; (lot 2,&nbsp; Psu-103916) and along&nbsp; line 5-2, by Lot 1&nbsp; of&nbsp; plan&nbsp; Psu-103916-Amd (should be Psu-103914-Amd.)&nbsp; (Proposed Constabulary Barracks:)"<br></blockquote>The City of Tagaytay sought&nbsp; original registration of this parcel of land, allegedly acquired by purchase from Zosimo Rojas,&nbsp; either under&nbsp; Act No. 496 or pursuant to Chapter VIII of&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 141, said applicant and its predecessors-in-interest haying been in actual possession&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; since 1894.&nbsp; No copy of the deed of sale was attached to the&nbsp; application, allegedly because it was either lost or destroyed&nbsp; during the&nbsp; Japanese occupation. <br><br>As nobody appeared at the hearing to oppose the application, an order&nbsp; of general defualt&nbsp; was entered by the court&nbsp; against the&nbsp; whole world,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; applicant was allowed to adduce its evidence.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>On&nbsp; June 30, 1957, the court&nbsp; decreed registration of said Lot No. 1,&nbsp; plan Psu-103916. Amd. in the name of the&nbsp; City of&nbsp; Tagaytay, free from any&nbsp; liens and&nbsp; encumbrances, and the issuance of the corresponding certificate of title upon the finality of said decision.<br><br>On&nbsp; July 15, 1957, Zosimo Rojas, supposed&nbsp; vendor of the lot in question,&nbsp; together with his present co-petitioners Manuel, Bernardo,&nbsp; Deomedes, Felisa and Soledad, all surI&nbsp; named Rojas filed in the same proceeding a petition to set,&nbsp; aside the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; in so&nbsp; far as said Lot No. 1, Psu-103916-Amd. was concerned; to lift the order&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; general&nbsp; default&nbsp; as&nbsp; far&nbsp; as&nbsp; it&nbsp; affected them because as adjoining owners cited&nbsp; in&nbsp; the application no actual&nbsp; notice was&nbsp; served them&nbsp; as required in&nbsp; Section 32&nbsp; of Act 496, as&nbsp; amended;&nbsp; and praying that they be allowed to file their opposition&nbsp; to the&nbsp; registration of the aforesaid&nbsp; lot for the reason, among others, that said Lot No. 1&nbsp; was part of a bigger parcel of land already decreed in a previous land registration ease (Case No. 398, G.L.R.O. Rec. No.&nbsp; 53546) and&nbsp; covered&nbsp; by an&nbsp; original certificate of title (O.C.T. No. 29)&nbsp; issued by the Register of Deeds of Cavite in their names since&nbsp; December 5, 1940. <br><br>The lower court denied this petition by order of December 2,&nbsp; 1957;&nbsp; hence, the filing&nbsp; of the instant action by the&nbsp; Rojas&nbsp; brothers for the purpose already stated above.<br><br>Petitioners assert that the court <i>a quo</i>, in adjudicating ownership of&nbsp; the lot&nbsp; involved herein in&nbsp; favor of&nbsp; the applicant-respondent, notwithstanding notice of its previous registration&nbsp; and the existence of an&nbsp; original certificate of&nbsp; title covering the&nbsp; same, acted&nbsp; without jurisdiction. There is merit in this contention. <br><br>It is not controverted that Original&nbsp; Certificate of Title No. 29 issued in the names of petitioners on December 5,&nbsp; 1940,&nbsp; covers a parcel of land&nbsp; containing&nbsp; an area&nbsp; of 67,434&nbsp; square&nbsp; meters described&nbsp; and&nbsp; delimited&nbsp; in&nbsp; the original plan Psu-103916.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioners&nbsp; allege that Lot No. 1, with an area of 21,812 square meters, is&nbsp; within and forms a part of the aforementioned parcel of land. On&nbsp; the other hand, applicant-respondent claims that although&nbsp; the disputed&nbsp; Lot&nbsp; No. 1 originally belonged&nbsp; to petitioners, the latter&nbsp; sold&nbsp; it to the said respondent&nbsp; in 1937, for which reason, it&nbsp; is alleged, Lot No. 1 was segregated from survey plan&nbsp; Psu-103916 and embodied&nbsp; in subsequent survey plan Psu-103916 Amd.&nbsp; And since plan Psu-103916-Amd.&nbsp; (amendment-subdivision, prepared&nbsp; for the City&nbsp; of Tagaytay)&nbsp; was approved by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Director&nbsp; of Lands on February 9,, 1940, applicant-respondent contends that said plan could not have&nbsp; been approved&nbsp; had it&nbsp; included, as property&nbsp; of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Tagaytay,&nbsp; portions belonging to the petitioners.<br><br>This argument is fallacious.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no&nbsp; conflict&nbsp; between original&nbsp; survey plan Psu-103916&nbsp;&nbsp; (which is the basis of petitioners' title)&nbsp; and the amendatory plan Psu103916-Amd.&nbsp; for the latter is but a <span style="font-style: italic;">subdivision&nbsp; </span>plan,&nbsp; as its&nbsp; own title states&nbsp; (see&nbsp; Annex C which is respondent's Exh.&nbsp; A, upon which the decree in its&nbsp; favor was based.) Both&nbsp; plans refer to a parcel of land whose total area is 67,434&nbsp; square&nbsp; meters; the only difference is&nbsp; that the original plan refers to one single parcel, while the second plan refers to the same parcel but&nbsp; subdivided into four (4) lots&nbsp; (Nos.&nbsp; 1, 2,&nbsp; 3, and 4)&nbsp; whose aggregate area is the same 67,434 square meters.&nbsp; Consequently, there is no reason for the Director of&nbsp; Lands to disapprove the subdivision plan&nbsp; No. Psu-103916-Amd.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; fact that this latter plan&nbsp; was&nbsp; prepared&nbsp; in the&nbsp; name of the&nbsp; City&nbsp; of Tagaytay&nbsp; does not make the City the owner&nbsp; of&nbsp; the lots therein described.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; respondent claims&nbsp; only Lot 1 of the four mentioned in the plan.&nbsp; Be this as&nbsp; it may, the fact is that the whole parcel&nbsp; of 67,434 square&nbsp; meters which, as stated, includes Lot No. 1&nbsp; of subdivision plan Psu-103916-Amd. was&nbsp; subsequently decreed, on June 15, 1940, in favor of herein petitioners, and Original Certificate of Title No. 29&nbsp; covering the&nbsp; same&nbsp; was issued in&nbsp; their names on&nbsp; December 5,&nbsp; 1940 by the Register of Deeds of Cavite Province.&nbsp; This&nbsp; decree and certificate of title duly registered, being <span style="font-style: italic;">in rem,</span> are binding upon all, and with even greater force upon the respondent City of Tagaytay which, according to its own allegations, derives&nbsp; its right of ownership in virtue of its&nbsp; purchase&nbsp; from the registered owners Rojas.&nbsp; Under this situation, the most&nbsp; logical and natural course open to respondent, in the ordinary course of business or civil transactions, was to have its&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of purchase&nbsp; registered&nbsp; and obtain a transfer certificate&nbsp; of title in its name after&nbsp; securing the&nbsp; court's approval&nbsp; of the subdivision plan segregating Lot 1 from the&nbsp; bigger&nbsp; lot described in petitioners'&nbsp; Original Certificate of Title No. 29.&nbsp; If there be question as to the sale by Rojas&nbsp; to the City of&nbsp; Tagaytay, as it seems is now&nbsp; the case, and the supposed deed&nbsp; has&nbsp; been allegedly lost or destroyed during the war, respondent's remedy, if it really purchased Lot 1, is&nbsp; to&nbsp; compel the&nbsp; execution of&nbsp; another deed for the conveyance to it of the&nbsp; portion it had&nbsp; bought.&nbsp; Certainly, respondent can not, as it did on January 22, 1957, apply for&nbsp; the registration&nbsp; in&nbsp; its name of the already registered&nbsp; Lot No, 1,&nbsp; apparently, as averred by the petitioners, at&nbsp; the back of the registered owners. <br><br>As thus&nbsp; viewed, the pivotal issue is one of jurisdiction on the part of the lower court.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the other contentions of respondent&nbsp; regarding, possession in good&nbsp; faith, laches or&nbsp; claims&nbsp; of&nbsp; better&nbsp; right,&nbsp; while perhaps&nbsp; valid&nbsp; in&nbsp; an appropriate ordinary action,&nbsp; as to which we&nbsp; here express no&nbsp; opinion, can not avail in&nbsp; the case at bar if the court <i>a quo</i>, sitting as land registration court, had no jurisdiction over&nbsp; the&nbsp; subject matter&nbsp; in decreeing&nbsp; on June 30, 1967, the&nbsp; registration,&nbsp; in favor of respondent City,&nbsp; of a lot already previously decreed and registered is favor of the petitioners.<br><br>In a quite&nbsp; impressive line&nbsp; of decisions,&nbsp; it&nbsp; has&nbsp; been well-settled that a Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance has no jurisdiction&nbsp; to&nbsp; decree again&nbsp; the&nbsp; registration of&nbsp; land already decreed in an&nbsp; earlier land registration case and a second decree for the same land is null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; This is&nbsp; so, because when once decreed by a&nbsp; court of competent jurisdiction, the title&nbsp; to the&nbsp; land thus determined is already a <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata </span>binding on the whole world, the proceedings being in rem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; court has no power in&nbsp; a&nbsp; subsequent proceeding (not based on fraud&nbsp; and within the statutory period) to adjudicate the&nbsp; same&nbsp; title in favor&nbsp; of another person.&nbsp; Furthermore, the registration of the property in the name of the first registered owner in the Registration Book is a&nbsp; standing notice to the world that said property is already registered&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; name. <br><br>Hence,&nbsp; the later applicant is chargeable with notice that the land he applied&nbsp; for is already covered by&nbsp; a title&nbsp; so that&nbsp; he has no&nbsp; right whatsoever&nbsp; to apply for&nbsp; it.&nbsp;&nbsp; To declare the later title valid would defeat the&nbsp; very purpose of the Torrens&nbsp; system which is to quiet title to the property and guarantee&nbsp; its indefeasibility.&nbsp; It would undermine the faith and confidence&nbsp; of the people&nbsp; in&nbsp; the efficacy of the registration law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Applicant-respondent&nbsp; also&nbsp; alleges that even granting that Original Certificate of Title No. 29 includes Lot No. 1,&nbsp; such registration&nbsp; did&nbsp; not confer ownership&nbsp; upon the petitioners/at least insofar as&nbsp; that portion occupied by the&nbsp; City&nbsp; Hall of&nbsp; Tagaytay&nbsp; is&nbsp; concerned,&nbsp; it being contended that such building&nbsp; and the&nbsp; land&nbsp; whereon it was erected are properties for public use and, hence,&nbsp; are outside the scope and efficacy of the Torrens&nbsp; title acquired by petitioners, pursuant to Section 39 of Act 496.<br><br>The aforementioned Section 39 of&nbsp; the Land" Registration Act&nbsp; reads: <br><br>SEC. 39. Every person receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of&nbsp; a decree of&nbsp; registration, and every&nbsp; subsequent purchaser of registered land&nbsp; who takes&nbsp; a certificate of title&nbsp; for value in good faith shall hold the&nbsp; same free of&nbsp; all incumbrances except those noted on 'said&nbsp; certificate, and any of the following incumbrances which may be subsisting,&nbsp; namely:<br><br><i>First</i>.&nbsp; Liens,&nbsp; claims,&nbsp; or rights arising or existing&nbsp; under&nbsp; the laws or Constitution . . .&nbsp; which the statutes of the Philippine Islands can not require to appear of record in the registry.<br><br><i>Second.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxes within two&nbsp; years&nbsp; after the&nbsp; same&nbsp; become due and payable. <br><br><i>Third</i>. Any public&nbsp; highway, way, private way&nbsp; established by law, or&nbsp; any Government irrigation canal or lateral thereof, where the certificate of title does not state that the boundaries of such highway,&nbsp; way,&nbsp; or irrigation canal or lateral thereof,&nbsp; have been&nbsp; determined. <br><br>The aforequoted&nbsp; provision specifically&nbsp; enumerates&nbsp; the only cases that may limit the registered owners absolute title over the property:&nbsp; (1) liens, claimsor rights existing or&nbsp; arising under the&nbsp; laws or the Constitution and which the statutes do not require their&nbsp; annotation or appearance in&nbsp; the registry;&nbsp; (2) taxes&nbsp; within 2 years after they become&nbsp; due&nbsp; and payable;&nbsp; (3) encumbrance&nbsp; or&nbsp; lien&nbsp; duly annotated in the certificate of title; and (4) any public highway, way,&nbsp; private way established by&nbsp; law,&nbsp; or any Government&nbsp; irrigation canal&nbsp; or&nbsp; lateral thereof&nbsp; existing on the property even if&nbsp; not annotated in the certificate. It is clear therefrom that&nbsp; even&nbsp; if&nbsp; we&nbsp; concede,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the sake of argument,&nbsp; that a municipal building or city hall and&nbsp; the land whereon it&nbsp; is erected may be considered as properties for public use, under the well-accepted principle&nbsp; of<span style="font-style: italic;"> inclusio unins est exclusio alterias, </span>respondent cannot validly invoke the provision of law quoted above. <br><br>This decision is&nbsp; limited only to the action of the trial court, sitting as land registration court, decreeing, for the second time, the registration of Lot No. 1 of subdivision plan Psu-103916—Amd.&nbsp; in favor of respondent&nbsp; City of Tagaytay, a lot already previously decreed by a&nbsp; competent court in favor of the petitioners, which action, we hold, is null and void. Wherefore, petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; granted and&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court's order of December 2, 1957 as well as the decision&nbsp; dated June 30, 1957, are&nbsp; hereby set aside.&nbsp; The injunction heretofore issued is made&nbsp; permanent, with costs against&nbsp; the respondent City of Tagaytay. It is&nbsp; so ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Reyes, J.
