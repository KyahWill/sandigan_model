				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction seeking to set 
aside two orders of respondent Judge which are alleged to have been issued in 
excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion. The writ prayed for 
was issued upon filing by petitioner of the required bond.<p></p>
<p>The orders complained of involved the payment of two-judgment credits, one in 
favor of petitioner and the other of Jacinta Abella against a common debtor, G.K. Co Bun Kim. The only property of Co Bun Kim for the payment of said credits 
is a seventeen-door apartment building in Ermita, Manila, and the funds in the 
hands of the receiver of the building. The receivership was instituted in Civil 
Case No. 16221 of the Court of First Instance of Manila at the instance of one 
Natalio Enriquez in order to preserve the property and secure payment of the 
credit existing in his favor.</p>
<p>The judgment credit of petitioner originated from a loan of P20,986.42 taken 
by Co Bun Kim from one Concha Apacible which he obtained for the improvement and 
preservation of the building under receivership which he built on a parcel of 
land he leased from spouses Rafael Alonso and Consuelo A. Lara. This loan was 
secured by Co Bun Kim with a mortgage over the same building which was duly 
recorded. On August 31, 1951, upon failure of Co Bun Kim to pay the loan as 
agreed upon, Apacible filed an action in the court of first instance for the 
foreclosure of the mortgage which was docketed as Civil Case No. 14603. Judgment 
was rendered on April 23, 1952 ordering Co Bun Kim to pay Apacible the sum of 
P20,986.42, with interest, attorneys' fees and costs. A writ of execution was 
secured by Apacible on July 7, 1952, but the execution was not carried out 
because the building was placed under receivership in Civil Case No. 16221 which 
was instituted by Co Bun Kim against Natalio Enriquez for the annulment of a 
third mortgage on the building for the amount of P50,000. It must be noted that 
the mortgage in favor of Apacible is only a second mortgage on the building, the 
first mortgage thereon for the sum of P30,000 being in favor of Tabacalera 
Company, and the third mortgage in favor of Natalio Enriquez. When Enriquez 
learned of the existence of the two prior mortgages, he bought the rights of 
Tabacalera and Apacible under their mortgages. The mortgage credit of Apacible 
was acquired by him on September 20, 1952 and that of Tabacalera on October 21, 
1952. Subsequently however, or on March 26, 1956, Natalio Enriquez transferred 
and assigned all his. rights under the three mortgages to the herein petitioner 
Mariano Cordova.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Co Bun Kim failed to pay the rentals of the land on which 
the building is erected and so on April 25, 1953, Jacinta Abella, who bought the 
land from its original owners, filed an action to collect them in the Court of 
First Instance of Manila which was docketed as Civil Case No. 19409. Judgment 
was rendered in favor of Abella ordering Co Bun Kim to pay the rentals from</p>
<p>January, 1953 to January, 1955, which judgment was affirmed by the Supreme 
Court on February 28, 1957.<br><br>On April 8, 1957, petitioner filed a motion 
in the receivership case (Civil Case No. 16221) praying that the receiver be 
authorized to pay him the judgment rendered in favor of Apacible which was 
assigned to him in preference to the judgment rendered in favor of Jacinta 
Abella for rentals of the building on the ground that his mortgage credit has 
preference under the law over that of Abella. Petitioner, on the same date, 
filed another motion praying that the judgment rendered in favor of Abella be 
held in abeyance until his, judgment credit shall have been satisfied based on 
the same ground of preference that his credit enjoys under the law. Both motions 
were denied by respondent Judge thereby giving the impression that the judgment 
in favor of Jacinta Abella for back rentals may be executed in preference to 
that of petitioner. Hence the present petition for certiorari.</p>
<p>The issue before us is whether the judgment credit of Concha Apacible which 
was assigned to petitioner is. preferred over the judgment credit in favor of 
Jacinta Abella, and if so, whether the former may be executed in preference to 
the latter contrary to what was decreed by respondent Judge.</p>
<p>Petitioner contends that his judgment credit is preferred over that of 
Jacinta Abella for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(a) the credit of petitioner matured and became due way back in 1951, and 
the judgment thereon became final and executory in June, 1952; .while the 
judgment of respondent Abella became final and executory only last March, 1957, 
and the same is for rentals which fell due only from January. 1953 up to 
January, 1955;</p>
<p>"(b) the judgment credit of petitioner is secured by a mortgage on the 
building in receivership from which the funds in the hands of the receiver were 
darived, which mortgage operates directly and immediately upon the said building 
and its income; while the claim of Abella is only for some months' back rentals 
on the land for which there is no lien whatsoever on the building or on the 
income therefrom in.the hands of the receiver;</p>
<p>"(c) the judgment credit of petitioner is on a loan wrich was used by the 
debtor Co Bun Kim for the repair, improvement and preservation of the building 
in receivership; and</p>
<p>"(d) the funds in the hands of the receiver, from which petitioner seeks 
payment, were collected and preserved because of the institution of the 
receivership at the instance of Natalio Enriquez, assignor of the petitioner, 
for the payment of his (now petitioner's mortgage credits, and not for the 
payment of the claim of Abella."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is merit in this contention. Under Article 2244 of the new Civil Code, 
re classification of credits, it is provided that, with reference to real and 
personal properties of the debtor, a credit which appears in a final judgment, 
which was the subject of litigation, is considered preferred, and the preference 
is determined by considering the priority of the dates of the judgment. Again, 
under Article 2242, it is also provided that, with reference to specific 
immovable property and real rights of the debtor, a mortgage credit recorded in 
the registry of property is deemed preferred in so far as the property mortgaged 
is concerned, over other unsecured credits. Under these legal provisions, there 
can be no question that the judgment credit rendered in favor of Concha Apacible 
which was assigned to petitioner is preferred over that of Jacinta Abella for 
back rentals because the same is not only prior in time but secured by a real 
estate mortgage. Thus, it appears that the judgment in favor of Apacible was 
rendered on April 23, 1952 and became final and executory on July 7, 1952, 
whereas the judgment credit in favor of appellee became final and executory only 
in March, 1957. On the other hand, the judgment credit of Abella is unsecured, 
whereas the credit of Apacible is secured by real estate mortgage which was duly 
recorded in the registry of property. There is therefore no plausible reason why 
the judgment credit of petitioner should not be executed in preference to that 
of Jacinta Abella.</p>
<p>It is true that the properties on which the judgment is sought to be executed 
are under receivership, but it is for this reason that petitioner filed a motion 
in the receivership case praying for authority for the payment of his judgment 
credit by the receiver as required by law. But even this step was thwarted 
because of the refusal of respondent Judge to grant the motion. Respondent-Judge 
seems to have adopted the attitude that the judgment credit of Jacinta Abella is 
entitled to preference and should first be executed. Obviously, respondent Judge 
acted on the matter with grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is granted. The orders subject of the petition are hereby 
set aside, the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court is declared 
permanent. Costs against respondent Jacinta Abella.</p>
