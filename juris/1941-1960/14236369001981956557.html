				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><center>I.&nbsp; <i>The case and the issue, in general</i><br></center><br>This Court has before it the delicate task&nbsp; of passing upon the&nbsp; validity&nbsp; and constitutionality of a&nbsp; legislative enactment,&nbsp; fundamental&nbsp; and&nbsp; far-reaching&nbsp; in&nbsp; significance. The enactment poses questions of due process, police&nbsp; power and equal protection of the laws.&nbsp; It also poses an important issue of fact, that is whether the conditions which the disputed law purports to&nbsp; remedy really&nbsp; or actually exist. Admittedly springing from a deep, militant, and positive nationalistic impulse, the law purports to protect citizen and country from the&nbsp; alien&nbsp; retailer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through it,&nbsp; and within the field of economy it regulates, Congress attempts to translate national aspirations for economic independence and national&nbsp; security, rooted in the drive and urge for national survival and&nbsp; welfare, into a concrete and tangible measures designed to free the national retailer from the competing dominance of&nbsp; the alien, so&nbsp; that&nbsp; the country and the nation may&nbsp; be&nbsp; free from&nbsp; a&nbsp; supposed economic dependence and bondage.&nbsp; Do the facts and circumstances justify the enactment?<br><br><center> <i>II. Pertinent 'provisions of Republic Act No. 1180</i> </center><br>Republic Act No. 1180&nbsp; is entitled "An Act to Regulate the Retail Business."&nbsp; In effect&nbsp; it nationalizes the retail trade business. The main provisions of the Act are: (1) a prohibition against persons, not citizens of the Philippines,&nbsp; and against associations,&nbsp; partnerships, or&nbsp; corporations the capital of which are not wholly owned&nbsp; by citizens of&nbsp; the Philippines, from&nbsp; engaging&nbsp; directly or&nbsp; indirectly in&nbsp; the retail trade;&nbsp; (2) an exception&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; above prohibition in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; aliens actually&nbsp; engaged in said business on May 15,&nbsp; 1954, who are allowed to continue&nbsp; to engage therein, unless their licenses are forfeited in accordance with the law, until their death or voluntary retirement in case of natural persons, and&nbsp; for ten years&nbsp; after the approval of the Act or until the expiration of term&nbsp; in case of juridical persons; (3) an exception therefrom&nbsp; in favor of citizens and juridical entities of the United States; (4) a&nbsp; provision for the forfeiture of&nbsp; licenses&nbsp; (to engage in the retail business) for violation of the laws on nationalization,&nbsp; economic control weights&nbsp; and measures and labor and other laws&nbsp; relating to trade, commerce and&nbsp; industry; (5)&nbsp; a&nbsp; prohibition&nbsp; against the establishment or opening by aliens actually engaged in the retail business of additional stores&nbsp; or branches of retail business,&nbsp; (6) a provision requiring aliens&nbsp; actually engaged&nbsp; in the retail business&nbsp; to present&nbsp; for&nbsp; registration&nbsp; with the&nbsp; proper authorities&nbsp; a verified&nbsp; statement concerning their&nbsp; businesses, giving, among other matters, the nature of the business, their assets and liabilities and their offices and principal&nbsp; offices&nbsp; of juridical entities;&nbsp; and (7) a provision allowing the heirs of&nbsp; aliens now negated in the&nbsp; retail&nbsp; business&nbsp; who&nbsp; die,&nbsp; to continue such business for a period of six months for purposes of liquidation,<br><br><div align="center">III. <i>Grounds upon which petition is based—Answer thereto</i><br></div><br>Petitioner, for&nbsp; and in&nbsp; his own behalf and on behalf&nbsp; of other alien residents,&nbsp; corporations and partnerships&nbsp; adversely affected by the provisions of Republic Act No. 1180, brought this&nbsp; action to obtain&nbsp; a judicial declaration that said Act is unconstitutional, and to&nbsp; enjoin&nbsp; the&nbsp; Secretary of&nbsp; Finance&nbsp; and all other persons acting under him, particularly city and municipal treasurers, from enforcing its provisions.&nbsp; Petitioner attacks the&nbsp; constitutionality of the Act, contending that: (1) it denies to alien residents the equal protection&nbsp; of the laws and deprives them of their liberty&nbsp; and&nbsp; property without due process of law;&nbsp; (2) the subject of the Act is not expressed or comprehended&nbsp; in the title thereof;&nbsp; (3) the Act&nbsp; violates&nbsp; international and treaty obligations of the Republic of the Philippines; (4) the provisions of the Act&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; transmission by aliens&nbsp; of their retail&nbsp; business&nbsp; thru hereditary succession, and those requiring&nbsp; 100%&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; capitalization for&nbsp; a corporation or entity to&nbsp; entitle it to engage in&nbsp; the retail business, violate the spirit&nbsp; of Sections&nbsp; 1 and 5,&nbsp; Article XIII and Section&nbsp; 8 of Article XIV&nbsp; of the Constitution. In answer,&nbsp; the Solicitor-General&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Fiscal&nbsp; of the City of Manila&nbsp; contend&nbsp; that:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; the Act&nbsp; was&nbsp; passed in&nbsp; the&nbsp; valid exercise of the&nbsp; police&nbsp; power&nbsp; of the State, which&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; is&nbsp; authorized&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Constitution&nbsp; in the interest of national economic survival;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; the Act has only one subject embraced in the title;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; no&nbsp; treaty or international&nbsp; obligations&nbsp; are&nbsp; infringed;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; as regards hereditary&nbsp; succession, only the form is affected but the value of the property is not impaired, and the institution of inheritance&nbsp; is only of statutory&nbsp; origin.<br><br><center> IV. <i>Preliminary consideration of legal principles involved</i> </center><blockquote><i>a.</i> The police power.—<br></blockquote>There is no&nbsp; question that the Act was approved in the exercise of the&nbsp; police power, but&nbsp; petitioner claims that its&nbsp; exercise in this instance is&nbsp; attended&nbsp; by a violation of the constitutional requirements of&nbsp; due process and equal protection of the laws.&nbsp; But before proceeding to the consideration and&nbsp; resolution of the ultimate issue- involved, it would be well to bear in mind&nbsp; certain basic and fundamental, albeit&nbsp; preliminary, considerations in the determination of the ever recurrent conflict between police power and the guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.&nbsp; What is the scope of&nbsp; police power, and how are the&nbsp; due&nbsp; process&nbsp; and equal protection&nbsp; clauses related to it V&nbsp; What is the province and&nbsp; power of the legislature, and what is the function and duty&nbsp; of the&nbsp; courts?&nbsp;&nbsp; These consideration&nbsp; must&nbsp; be clearly&nbsp; and correctly understood that their application to the facts of the case may be brought forth with clarity and the issue accordingly resolved.<br><br>It has been said that police power is so far-reaching in scope,&nbsp; that&nbsp; it&nbsp; has&nbsp; become&nbsp; almost impossible to limit its sweep.&nbsp; As it derives&nbsp; its&nbsp; existence from the very existence of the State itself, it does not need to&nbsp; be expressed&nbsp; or defined in its scope; it is&nbsp; said to be&nbsp; co-extensive with self- protection and&nbsp; survival, and as such it is&nbsp; the most positive and active of all governmental processes, the most essential, insistent and illimitable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially is it so under a modern democratic framework where the demands of society and of nations have multiplied to&nbsp; almost&nbsp; unimaginable proportions; the field and scope of police power has&nbsp; become almost boundles3, just as the fields&nbsp; of public interest and public&nbsp; welfare have become almost all-embracing and have transcended human&nbsp; foresight.&nbsp; Otherwise stated,&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp; we cannot foresee the&nbsp; needs and demands of public interest and welfare in this constantly&nbsp; changing and progressive world,&nbsp; so we cannot delimit beforehand the extent or scope of police power by&nbsp; which&nbsp; and through which the State seeks to attain&nbsp; or&nbsp; achieve&nbsp; public interest or welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is that Constitutions do not define the scope or extent of the police power&nbsp; of the State;&nbsp; what&nbsp; they&nbsp; do is to&nbsp; set forth the limitations thereof.&nbsp; The most important of these are the due process clause&nbsp; and the&nbsp; equal&nbsp; protection clause.<br><blockquote><i>b.</i> Limitations on police&nbsp; power.—<br></blockquote>The basic limitations of due process and equal protection are found in the following&nbsp; provisions of&nbsp; our Constitution:<br><blockquote> "SECTION 1.(1)&nbsp; No person shall&nbsp; be deprived of life, liberty or property&nbsp; without&nbsp; due process&nbsp; of law,&nbsp; nor shall any&nbsp; person be denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; equal&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; laws."&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; III,&nbsp; Phil. Constitution) </blockquote>These constitutional guarantees which embody the essence of individual liberty and freedom in&nbsp; democracies, are not limited to citizens alone but&nbsp; are admittedly&nbsp; universal in their application, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yick Wo <i>vs.</i> Hopkins, SO, L. ed. 220, 226.)<br><blockquote><div align="left"><i>c.</i> The equal&nbsp; protection&nbsp; clause.—<br></div></blockquote>The equal protection of the law&nbsp; clause is against undue favor&nbsp; and individual&nbsp; or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the&nbsp; oppression of&nbsp; inequality.&nbsp; It is not intended to prohibit legislation, which is limited either in the object to which&nbsp; it is directed or by territory within which it is to operate.&nbsp; It does not demand absolute equality among residents;&nbsp; it merely&nbsp;&nbsp; requires that&nbsp; all&nbsp; persons shall&nbsp; be treated alike, <i>under like circumstances and conditions</i> both as&nbsp; to&nbsp; privileges conferred&nbsp; and&nbsp; liabilities&nbsp; enforced. The equal protection clause is not infringed by legislation which applies&nbsp; only&nbsp; to those persons falling within&nbsp; a specified class, if it applies alike to all persons&nbsp; within such class, and reasonable grounds exists for making" a distinction between those&nbsp; who fall&nbsp; within&nbsp; such class and those who&nbsp; do&nbsp; not. (2 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, 824-825.)<br><blockquote><i>d.</i> The due process&nbsp; clause.—<br></blockquote>The due process clause has to do with&nbsp; the&nbsp; reasonableness of legislation enacted in pursuance of the police power. Is there&nbsp; public interest, a public purpose; is public welfare involved?&nbsp; Is the&nbsp; Act reasonably&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; for the&nbsp; accomplishment of the&nbsp; legislature's purpose; is it not unreasonable,&nbsp; arbitrary&nbsp; or oppressive? Is.&nbsp; there&nbsp; sufficient foundation&nbsp; or reason in connection with&nbsp; the matter&nbsp; involved ; or has there not been a capricious use of the legislative power?&nbsp; Can the aims&nbsp; conceived&nbsp; be achieved by the means used,&nbsp; or is it not merely an unjustified interference with private&nbsp; interest?&nbsp; These&nbsp; are&nbsp; the&nbsp; questions that&nbsp; we ask when the due process test&nbsp; is applied.<br><br>The conflict,&nbsp; therefore, between&nbsp; police&nbsp; power and the guarantees&nbsp; of due process&nbsp; and&nbsp; equal&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of the laws is&nbsp; more apparent&nbsp; than real.&nbsp; Properly&nbsp; related, the power and the&nbsp; guarantees are supposed to coexist.&nbsp; The balancing is the essence or, shall it be said, the indispensable means for&nbsp; the attainment&nbsp; of legitimate&nbsp; aspirations&nbsp; of any democratic&nbsp; society.&nbsp;&nbsp; There can be no absolute power, whoever exercise it, for that would be tyranny.&nbsp; Yet there can neither be absolute liberty, for that would mean license and&nbsp; anarchy.&nbsp; So the State&nbsp; can deprive persons of life, liberty&nbsp; and&nbsp; property, provided there&nbsp; is&nbsp; due&nbsp; process&nbsp; of law; and persons may be classified into classes and groups, provided everyone&nbsp; is&nbsp; given&nbsp; the&nbsp; equal&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of the law.&nbsp; The test&nbsp; or&nbsp; standard,&nbsp; as&nbsp; always,&nbsp; is&nbsp; reason.&nbsp; The police power legislation must&nbsp; be firmly grounded on public interest&nbsp; and&nbsp; welfare, and a reasonable relation must exist between&nbsp; purposes and&nbsp; means.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if distinction and classification has been&nbsp; made, there must be a reasonable&nbsp; basis for said&nbsp; distinction.<br><blockquote><i>e. Legislative discretion not subject to judicial review.—</i><br></blockquote>Now,&nbsp; in this matter of equitable balancing1, what is the proper place and role of the courts?&nbsp; It must not be&nbsp; overlooked, in the first&nbsp; place, that the legislature, which is the constitutional repository of police power and exercises the prerogative&nbsp; of&nbsp; determining the policy of the State, is by force of circumstances primarily the judge of&nbsp; necessity, adequacy or reasonableness and wisdom, of any law promulgated in the exercise of the police&nbsp; power, or of the measures&nbsp; adopted to&nbsp; implement the&nbsp; public policy or to achieve public interest.&nbsp; On the other hand, courts, although zealous guardians of&nbsp; individual liberty&nbsp; and&nbsp; right,&nbsp; have nevertheless evinced&nbsp; a reluctance to interfere&nbsp; with the exercise of the&nbsp; legislative prerogative.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have&nbsp; done so early where there&nbsp; has been&nbsp; a clear,&nbsp; patent&nbsp; or palpable arbitrary and&nbsp; unreasonable abuse of&nbsp; the legislative prerogative.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; courts are not supposed&nbsp; to override legitimate policy, and courts never inquire into&nbsp; the wisdom of the law.<br><blockquote><div align="left"> V. <i>Economic&nbsp; problems&nbsp; sought to be&nbsp; remedied</i> </div></blockquote>With the above&nbsp; considerations in mind,&nbsp; we&nbsp; will now proceed to&nbsp; delve directly into&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue involved.&nbsp; If the disputed legislation were merely a regulation, as&nbsp; its title indicates, there would be no question&nbsp; that&nbsp; it falls within the legitimate&nbsp; scope of&nbsp; legislative power.&nbsp; But it goes further and prohibits&nbsp; a group&nbsp; of residents,&nbsp; the aliens, from engaging therein.&nbsp; The&nbsp; problem becomes more complex because its subject is a common, trade or&nbsp; occupation, as old&nbsp; as society itself, which&nbsp; from time immemorial&nbsp; has always been open to&nbsp; residents, irrespective of race, color or citizenship.<br><blockquote><i>a.</i> Importance of&nbsp; retail trade in the&nbsp; economy&nbsp; of&nbsp; the nation.—<br></blockquote>In a primitive economy where families produce all that they consume and consume all that they produce, the dealer, of course, is unknown.&nbsp; But&nbsp; as group&nbsp; life develops&nbsp; and families begin to live in communities producing more than what they&nbsp; consume&nbsp; and needing&nbsp; an&nbsp; infinite&nbsp; number of things they do not produce, the dealer comes into&nbsp; existence.<br><br>As villages develop into big communities and specialization in production begins, the dealer's importance is enhanced. Under modern conditions and standards of living, in which man's needs have&nbsp; multiplied and&nbsp; diversified to unlimited extents and proportions, the retailer comes&nbsp; as essential as the producer, because thru him the infinite variety of articles, goods&nbsp; and commodities&nbsp; needed&nbsp; for&nbsp; daily life&nbsp; are placed within the easy&nbsp; reach of consumers.&nbsp; Retail&nbsp; dealers perform the functions&nbsp; of capillaries&nbsp; in the human body, thru which all the needed food and supplies&nbsp; are ministered to members of the&nbsp; communities comprising the nation.<br><br>There cannot be any question about&nbsp; the&nbsp; importance of the retailer in the life of the&nbsp; community.&nbsp;&nbsp; He ministers to the&nbsp; resident's daily needs,&nbsp; food in all&nbsp; its increasing forms,&nbsp; and the various little&nbsp; gadgets and&nbsp; things&nbsp; needed for home and&nbsp; daily life.&nbsp; He provides his customers around his store with the rice or corn, the fish, the salt, the vinegar, the spices&nbsp; needed&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; daily cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; has cloths to sell,&nbsp; even the needle and&nbsp; the&nbsp; thread to sew&nbsp; them or darn&nbsp; the clothes that wear out.&nbsp; The retailer, therefore, from&nbsp; the lowly peddler,&nbsp; the owner of a small&nbsp; sari-sari store, to the operator of a department store or a&nbsp; supermarket&nbsp; is so much a part of day-to-day existence.<br><blockquote><i>b</i>. The alien retailer's, traits.—<br></blockquote>The alien retailer&nbsp; must have started plying&nbsp; his&nbsp; trade in this&nbsp; country in the bigger centers&nbsp; of population (Time there&nbsp; was when he was unknown in provincial&nbsp; towns and villages).&nbsp; Slowly&nbsp; but&nbsp; gradually&nbsp; he&nbsp; invaded towns and villages; now he predominates in the cities and big centers of population.&nbsp; He even pioneers in far&nbsp; away nooks where the beginnings of community life&nbsp; appear,&nbsp; ministering to the daily needs of the residents&nbsp; and purchasing&nbsp; their agricultural produce for sale in the towns.&nbsp; It is an undeniable fact that in many communities&nbsp; the alien has replaced&nbsp; the native retailer.&nbsp; He&nbsp; has shown in&nbsp; this&nbsp; trade,&nbsp; industry without limit,&nbsp; and the patience and forbearance&nbsp; of a slave. Derogatory epithets are hurled at him, but he laughs these off without murmur;&nbsp; insults of ill-bred&nbsp; and insolent neighbors and&nbsp; customers&nbsp; are made in&nbsp; his face,&nbsp; but he&nbsp; heeds them not,&nbsp; and he forgets, and forgives.&nbsp; The community takes no note of him, as he appears to be&nbsp; harmless and extremely useful.<br><blockquote><i>c</i>.&nbsp; Alleged&nbsp; alien&nbsp; control&nbsp; and&nbsp; dominance.—<br></blockquote>There is a general feeling on the part of the public, which appears to be true to&nbsp; fact, about&nbsp; the controlling and dominant position that the alien retailer holds in the nation's economy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Food and&nbsp; other&nbsp; essentials, clothing, almost all articles of daily life&nbsp; reach the&nbsp; residents&nbsp; mostly through him.&nbsp; In big cities and&nbsp; centers&nbsp; of population he&nbsp; has&nbsp; acquired not only predominance, but apparent control aver distribution of almost all kinds of&nbsp; goods, such as&nbsp; lumber, hardware,&nbsp; textiles, groceries, drugs, sugar, flour,&nbsp; garlic, and&nbsp; scores of other goods and articles.&nbsp; And&nbsp; were it&nbsp; not for some national corporations like the Naric, the Namarco, the&nbsp; Facomas&nbsp; and the Accfa,&nbsp; his&nbsp; control&nbsp; over principal foods and products would easily&nbsp; become full and complete.<br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; denies that there is alien predominance and control in&nbsp; the retail trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; In one breath it&nbsp; is said that the&nbsp; fear&nbsp; is&nbsp; unfounded&nbsp; and the threat is&nbsp; imagined;&nbsp; in another,&nbsp; it is charged that the law is merely the result of racialism and pure and unabashed&nbsp; nationalism.&nbsp; Alienage, it is said, is not an element of&nbsp; control; also so&nbsp; many unmanageable factors in the retail business make control virtually impossible.&nbsp; The first argument which brings up an issue of fact merits serious consideration.&nbsp; The others are matters of opinion within the exclusive competence of the legislature and beyond our&nbsp; prerogative to pass upon and&nbsp; decide.<br><br>The best evidence&nbsp; are the statistics on the&nbsp; retail&nbsp; trade, which put down the figures in black and white.&nbsp; Between the constitutional&nbsp; convention year&nbsp; (1935), when the fear of alien domination and&nbsp; control of&nbsp; the retail trade already filled the minds&nbsp; of our&nbsp; leaders&nbsp; with fears and misgivings, and the year of the&nbsp; enactment of the&nbsp; nationalization of the retail&nbsp; trade&nbsp; act (1954), official statistics unmistakably point&nbsp; out&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; ever-increasing&nbsp; dominance and&nbsp; control by the&nbsp; alien of&nbsp; the retail trade,&nbsp; as witness the&nbsp; following tables:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div

include corporations and partnerships, while&nbsp; the figures&nbsp; on&nbsp; Filipino establishments already&nbsp; include&nbsp; mere&nbsp; market&nbsp; vendors,&nbsp; whose capital&nbsp; is necessarily small.<br><br>The above figures reveal that in&nbsp; percentage&nbsp; distribution&nbsp; of assets and of gross sales,&nbsp; alien participation has steadily increased during the years.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is true, of course, that&nbsp; Filipinos have the edge in the number of retailers, but aliens more than make up&nbsp; for the&nbsp; numerical gap through their assets and gross sales&nbsp; which average between six and seven&nbsp; times&nbsp; those&nbsp; of the&nbsp; very&nbsp; many&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; retailers. Numbers in&nbsp; retailers, here, do&nbsp; not imply superiority; the alien&nbsp; invests&nbsp; more capital,&nbsp; buys and sells six&nbsp; to seven times more, and gains much more. The same official report, pointing out to&nbsp; the&nbsp; known predominance of&nbsp; foreign elements&nbsp; in the retail&nbsp; trade,&nbsp; remarks that the&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; retailers were largely engaged in minor retailer enterprises. As&nbsp; observed&nbsp; by respondents,&nbsp; the native&nbsp; investment&nbsp; is thinly spread,&nbsp; and the Filipino&nbsp; retailer is practically helpless in matters of capital, credit,&nbsp; price" and&nbsp; supply.<br><br><i><center> d. Alien control and threat,&nbsp; subject of apprehension in Constitutional Convention.— </center> </i><br>It is this domination and control, which&nbsp; we believe&nbsp; has been&nbsp; sufficiently shown to exist,&nbsp; that&nbsp; is the legislature's target in the&nbsp; enactment of&nbsp; the&nbsp; disputed&nbsp; nationalization law.&nbsp; If they did not exist as a fact the sweeping remedy of nationalization&nbsp; would&nbsp; never have&nbsp;&nbsp; been&nbsp; adopted.&nbsp; The framers&nbsp; of our Constitution&nbsp; also&nbsp; believed in the existence of this alien dominance and control when they approved&nbsp; a resolution categorically declaring&nbsp; among other things, that "it is the sense of the Convention that the public interest requires&nbsp; the nationalization of the retail trade; * * *."&nbsp;&nbsp; (II Aruego,&nbsp; The Framing of the&nbsp; Philippine Constitution, 662— 663, quoted on page&nbsp; 67 of Petitioner.)&nbsp; That was twenty- two&nbsp; years ago; and&nbsp; the events since&nbsp; then&nbsp; have not been either pleasant or comforting.&nbsp; Dean&nbsp; Sinco&nbsp; of the University of the Philippines College of&nbsp; Law, commenting on the patrimony clause of&nbsp; the Preamble opines that the fathers of our Constitution&nbsp; were merely translating the&nbsp; general preoccupation&nbsp; of Filipinos "of the dangers&nbsp; from&nbsp; alien interests that&nbsp; had already&nbsp; brought under their control&nbsp; the commercial and other&nbsp; economic activities of the&nbsp; country" (Sinco, Phil. Political Law, 10th ed., p. 114); and analyzing the concern of the members&nbsp; of the constitutional convention for the economic&nbsp; life&nbsp; of the citizens,&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection with&nbsp; the nationalistic provisions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution, he says:<br><blockquote>"But there has been a general feeling that alien dominance over the economic life of the country is not desirable and that if such&nbsp; a situation should remain, political independence alone is no&nbsp; guarantee to national stability and&nbsp; strength.&nbsp;&nbsp; Filipino private&nbsp; capital is not big enough to&nbsp; wrest from alien hands the control&nbsp; of the national economy. Moreover,&nbsp; it is but of&nbsp; recent formation and hence, largely&nbsp; inexperienced, timid&nbsp; and hesitant.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; such&nbsp; conditions, the&nbsp; government as the instrumentality of the national&nbsp; will, has to step in&nbsp; and assume the initiative, if not the leadership,&nbsp; in the struggle&nbsp; for the economic freedom&nbsp; of the nation in somewhat the&nbsp; same way that it did in the crusade for political freedom.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; it (the Constitution)&nbsp; envisages&nbsp; an&nbsp; organized movement for the protection of the nation not only against the possibilities of armed invasion but also against its economic subjugation by&nbsp; alien&nbsp; interests in the economic field."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Phil. Political&nbsp; Law by Sinco, 10th ed., p. 476.)</blockquote>Belief in&nbsp; the existence of&nbsp; alien control&nbsp; and predominance&nbsp; is felt&nbsp; in other&nbsp; quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Filipino&nbsp; businessmen, manufacturers&nbsp; and producers&nbsp; believe so; they fear the dangers coming from&nbsp; alien&nbsp; control, and&nbsp; they express sentiments&nbsp; of&nbsp; economic independence.&nbsp; Witness thereto is Resolution No.&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; approved on July&nbsp; IS,&nbsp; 1958, of the Fifth National&nbsp; Convention&nbsp; of Filipino&nbsp; Businessmen,&nbsp; and. a similar resolution, approved on March 20, 1954, of the Second National Convention&nbsp; of Manufacturers&nbsp; and Producers.&nbsp; The man in the street also&nbsp; believes, and&nbsp; fears, alien predominance&nbsp; and control; so our newspapers,&nbsp; which have editorially pointed out&nbsp; not only to control but to alien stranglehold.&nbsp; We, therefore,&nbsp; find&nbsp; alien domination and&nbsp;&nbsp; control to&nbsp; be&nbsp; a&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; a&nbsp; reality proved by&nbsp; official statistics, and&nbsp; felt&nbsp; by&nbsp; all the&nbsp; sections and groups that compose the Filipino&nbsp; community.<br><blockquote><i>e.&nbsp; Dangers of alien control&nbsp; and dominance in retail.—</i><br></blockquote>But the&nbsp; dangers arising&nbsp; from&nbsp; alien&nbsp; participation&nbsp; in the retail trade&nbsp; does not seem to lie in&nbsp; the&nbsp; predominance alone; there is&nbsp; a prevailing&nbsp; feeling&nbsp; that&nbsp; such&nbsp; predominance may&nbsp; truly endanger&nbsp; the national&nbsp; interest.&nbsp; With ample capital,&nbsp; unity of purpose and action&nbsp; and&nbsp; thorough organization,&nbsp; alien&nbsp; retailers and merchants&nbsp; can act&nbsp; in such&nbsp; complete&nbsp; unison and concert on such&nbsp; vital&nbsp; matters as the fixing of prices, the determination of&nbsp; the amount of goods or articles to be made available in the market, and&nbsp; even the choice of the goods or&nbsp; articles they would or would not patronize&nbsp; or&nbsp; distribute, that&nbsp; fears of dislocation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; national economy and&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; complete subservience of&nbsp; national retailers and of the&nbsp; consuming public are not entirely unfounded.&nbsp; Nationals,&nbsp; producers and consumers alike, can&nbsp; be placed completely&nbsp; at&nbsp; their mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp; easily illustrated.&nbsp; Suppose an article of daily use&nbsp; is&nbsp; desired to be prescribed&nbsp; by the aliens, because the&nbsp; producer or importer does not offer them sufficient profits, or because a new competing article offers bigger profits for its introduction.&nbsp; All that aliens would do is to agree to refuse to sell the first article,&nbsp; eliminating it from their stocks, offering the new one as a substitute. Hence, the producers or importers of the prescribed article, or its consumers, find the article suddenly out of circulation.&nbsp; Freedom of&nbsp; trade&nbsp; is&nbsp; thus&nbsp; curtailed and&nbsp; free enterprise&nbsp; correspondingly suppressed.<br><br>We can even&nbsp; go farther than&nbsp; theoretical&nbsp; illustrations to show the pernicious&nbsp; influences&nbsp; of&nbsp; alien&nbsp; domination. Grave&nbsp; abuses have characterized the exercise of&nbsp; the retail trade&nbsp; by aliens.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is a&nbsp; fact&nbsp; within judicial notice, which&nbsp; courts&nbsp; of&nbsp; justice may&nbsp; not&nbsp; properly&nbsp; overlook or ignore in&nbsp; the&nbsp; interests&nbsp; of truth and justice,&nbsp; that there exists a general feeling&nbsp; on the part of the public that alien participation in the retail trade has&nbsp; been attended by&nbsp; a pernicious&nbsp; and intolerable practices,&nbsp; the&nbsp; mention of a few of which would&nbsp; suffice for our purposes; that at some time&nbsp; or other they&nbsp; have cornered&nbsp; the&nbsp; market of&nbsp; essential&nbsp; commodities,&nbsp; like&nbsp; corn and&nbsp; rice,&nbsp;&nbsp; creating artificial scarcities to justify&nbsp; and enhance profits to unreasonable proportions;&nbsp; that&nbsp; they have hoarded essential foods to the&nbsp; inconvenience and prejudice of the consuming public, so much so that the Government has had to establish&nbsp; the National Rice&nbsp; and&nbsp; Corn&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; to&nbsp; save the public&nbsp; from&nbsp; their continuous hoarding practices&nbsp; and tendencies; that they have violated&nbsp; price control laws, especially on foods and essential commodities,&nbsp; such that the legislature had to enact a law&nbsp; (See.&nbsp; 9, Republic Act No.&nbsp; 1168),&nbsp; authorizing&nbsp; their&nbsp; immediate&nbsp; and&nbsp; automatic deportation for price control convictions; that they&nbsp; have secret combinations among themselves&nbsp; to control prices, cheating the&nbsp; operation of the law of supply and&nbsp; demand; that they&nbsp; have&nbsp; connived to&nbsp; boycott&nbsp; honest merchants and traders who would not cater or yield to their&nbsp; demands, in unlawful restraint of freedom of trade and enterprise. They are believed by the public to have evaded&nbsp; tax laws, smuggled goods&nbsp; and money&nbsp; into&nbsp; and out&nbsp; of&nbsp; the land, violated&nbsp; import and export prohibitions, control&nbsp; laws&nbsp; and the like, in derision and contempt of&nbsp; lawful&nbsp; authority. It is also believed&nbsp; that they have&nbsp; engaged in corrupting public&nbsp; officials with fabulous bribes, indirectly causing the prevalence&nbsp; of graft and corruption in the&nbsp; Government. As a matter of fact appeals to unscrupulous aliens have been made both&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Government and&nbsp; by their own lawful diplomatic representatives,&nbsp; action which&nbsp; impliedly admits a prevailing feeling&nbsp; about&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence of many of the above&nbsp; practices.<br><br>The&nbsp; circumstances above set forth create well founded fears that worse things&nbsp; may come&nbsp; in&nbsp; the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; The present&nbsp; dominance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; alien&nbsp; retailer,&nbsp; especially in the big'&nbsp; centers&nbsp; of&nbsp; population, therefore, becomes a potential source of danger&nbsp; on&nbsp; occasions&nbsp; of&nbsp; war&nbsp; or other calamity.&nbsp; We do not have here in this country isolated groups of harmless aliens retailing&nbsp; goods among nationals ; what we have are well&nbsp; organized and powerful groups that dominate the&nbsp; distribution of&nbsp; goods and commodities in the communities and big centers of population. They owe no allegiance or loyalty to the State,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the State cannot rely upon them in times of&nbsp; crisis&nbsp; or emergency. While&nbsp; the&nbsp; national holds his&nbsp; life,&nbsp; his&nbsp; person&nbsp; and&nbsp; his property subject&nbsp; to the&nbsp; needs of&nbsp; his&nbsp; country,&nbsp; the alien may even&nbsp; become&nbsp; the potential&nbsp; enemy of the&nbsp; State.<br><blockquote><i>f. Law enacted in interest&nbsp; of&nbsp; national&nbsp; economic&nbsp; survival and security.—</i><br></blockquote>We are fully satisfied&nbsp; upon a consideration of all&nbsp; the facts and&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; that&nbsp; the disputed law is&nbsp; not the product of racial hostility, prejudice or discrimination, but the expression&nbsp; of the legitimate desire and determinetion of the people, thru&nbsp; their authorized representatives, to free the nation from the economic&nbsp; situation that has •unfortunately&nbsp; been saddled upon it&nbsp; rightly&nbsp; or wrongly, to its disadvantage.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; law is clearly&nbsp; in&nbsp; the interest of the public,&nbsp; nay of&nbsp; the national&nbsp; security itself,&nbsp; and indisputably falls within the scope of police&nbsp; power, thru which and&nbsp; by which&nbsp; the State&nbsp; insures&nbsp; its existence and security and&nbsp; the supreme&nbsp; welfare&nbsp; of its&nbsp; citizens.<br><br><center> <i>VI.&nbsp; The Equal Protection Limitation</i> </center><blockquote><i>a. Objections to alien&nbsp; participation in retail&nbsp; trade.—</i><br></blockquote>The next question that now poses solution&nbsp; is, Does the law&nbsp; deny the&nbsp; equal protection of the laws?&nbsp; As pointed out&nbsp; above,&nbsp; the mere fact&nbsp; of&nbsp; alienage is&nbsp; the&nbsp; root&nbsp; and cause&nbsp; of the&nbsp; distinction&nbsp; between the alien and&nbsp; the national&nbsp; as a trader.&nbsp; The alien&nbsp; resident&nbsp; owes&nbsp; allegiance to the country of his birth or&nbsp; his&nbsp; adopted country; his stay&nbsp; here&nbsp; is&nbsp; for&nbsp; personal&nbsp; convenience;&nbsp; he&nbsp; is&nbsp; attracted by the lure of gain&nbsp; and profit.&nbsp;&nbsp; His aim&nbsp; or purpose of stay, we admit, is neither illegitimate&nbsp; nor immoral, but he is naturally lacking&nbsp; in&nbsp; that&nbsp; spirit of loyalty&nbsp; and enthusiasm for this&nbsp; country where he temporarily stays and makes his&nbsp; living,&nbsp; or of&nbsp; that spirit' of&nbsp; regard,&nbsp; sympathy and&nbsp; consideration for his&nbsp; Filipino customers&nbsp; as would prevent&nbsp; him from taking&nbsp; advantage&nbsp; of their weakness and&nbsp; exploiting them.&nbsp; The faster he makes his pile, the earlier can&nbsp; the alien go&nbsp; back&nbsp; to&nbsp; his beloved&nbsp; country and his beloved&nbsp; kin and countrymen.&nbsp; The&nbsp; experience of the country is that the alien retailer has&nbsp; shown such&nbsp; utter disregard for his&nbsp; customers and the people on whom he makes his profit, that&nbsp; it&nbsp; has been&nbsp; found necessary to adopt the legislation, radical as it may seem.<br><br>Another objection to the&nbsp; alien retailer in this country is that he&nbsp; never&nbsp; really&nbsp; makes a genuine contribution to national&nbsp; income and wealth.&nbsp; He undoubtedly contributes to general&nbsp; distribution,&nbsp; but&nbsp; the gains&nbsp; and&nbsp; profits he makes are not invested&nbsp; in&nbsp; industries that&nbsp; would help the country's economy&nbsp; and increase&nbsp; national&nbsp; wealth.&nbsp; The alien's interest in this country being merely transient and temporary,&nbsp; it would indeed be ill-advised to continue&nbsp; entrusting the very important function of retail distribution to his hands.<br><br>The practices&nbsp; resorted&nbsp; to by aliens in the&nbsp; control of distribution, as&nbsp; already pointed out&nbsp; above, their&nbsp; secret manipulations of stocks of&nbsp; commodities&nbsp; and prices, their utter&nbsp; disregard&nbsp; of&nbsp; the welfare&nbsp; of their customers and of the ultimate&nbsp; happiness&nbsp; of&nbsp; the people&nbsp; of the&nbsp; nation of which they are mere guests, which&nbsp; practices, manipulations and&nbsp; disregard do not attend the&nbsp; exercise&nbsp; of the trade&nbsp; by the nationals,&nbsp; show the&nbsp; existence of real and actual,&nbsp; positive&nbsp; and fundamental&nbsp; differences between&nbsp; an alien and a national which fully&nbsp; justify&nbsp; the&nbsp; legislative classification adopted in the retail&nbsp; trade&nbsp; measure.&nbsp;&nbsp; These differences&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly a valid&nbsp; reason&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; State to prefer the national over the alien&nbsp; in&nbsp; the retail trade.<br><br>We would be doing violence to&nbsp; fact and&nbsp; reality were&nbsp; we to hold&nbsp; that no&nbsp; reason or ground for a legitimate distinction&nbsp; can be&nbsp; found between&nbsp; one and&nbsp; the other.<br><blockquote><div align="left"> <i>b.&nbsp; Difference in alien aims and purposes sufficient basis for distinction.—</i> </div></blockquote>The above objectionable characteristics of the&nbsp; exercise of the&nbsp; retail&nbsp; trade&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; aliens,&nbsp; which are actual and real,&nbsp; furnish&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; grounds for legislative classification&nbsp; of&nbsp; retail&nbsp; traders into nationals and&nbsp; aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some may disagree with&nbsp; the&nbsp; wisdom&nbsp; of the legislature's classification.&nbsp; To this we answer, that this is the prerogative of the law-making&nbsp; power.&nbsp; Since the Court&nbsp; finds that the classification&nbsp; is actual, real&nbsp; and&nbsp; reasonable,&nbsp; and&nbsp; all persons&nbsp; of&nbsp; one class are&nbsp; treated alike, and&nbsp; as it cannot be said that the classification is patently unreasonable and unfounded,&nbsp; it is&nbsp; in&nbsp; duty bound&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare that the legislature acted within&nbsp; its legitimate prerogative and it cannot&nbsp; declare&nbsp; that the act&nbsp; transcends&nbsp; the limit of&nbsp; equal protection&nbsp; established&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution.<br><br>Broadly speaking, the power of the legislature&nbsp; to make distinctions&nbsp; and classifications among persons&nbsp; is not&nbsp; curtailed or denied by the equal protection of the laws clause. The legislative power admits of a wide scope of discretion, and a law can be&nbsp; violative of the constitutional limitation only when the classification&nbsp; is&nbsp; without reasonable basis. In&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to the&nbsp; authorities&nbsp; we&nbsp; have earlier cited, we can also refer to the case of Lindsley <i>vs.</i> Natural Carbonic Gas Co.&nbsp; (1911),&nbsp; 55&nbsp; L.&nbsp; ed., 369,&nbsp; which&nbsp; clearly&nbsp; and&nbsp; succinctly&nbsp; defined the&nbsp; application&nbsp; of equal protection clause to a law sought to&nbsp; be voided&nbsp; as contrary thereto:<br><blockquote>'* * *1. the equal protection&nbsp; clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not&nbsp; take&nbsp; from&nbsp; the state the&nbsp; power&nbsp; to classify in the adoption of police laws, but admits of the exercise of the wide&nbsp; scope of discretion m&nbsp; that regard, and avoids&nbsp; what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis, and therefore is purely&nbsp; arbitrary.<br><br>2. A classification having&nbsp; some reasonable basis does&nbsp; not&nbsp; offend against that clause merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety, or because in&nbsp; practice it results in&nbsp; some inequality.&nbsp; 3. When the classification in&nbsp; such a law is called in question, if&nbsp; any&nbsp; state of facts&nbsp; reasonably&nbsp; can be&nbsp; conceived&nbsp; that would sustain it, the existence of that state of&nbsp; facts at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time the law was enacted must be assumed. 4.&nbsp; One&nbsp; who assails&nbsp; the classification in such&nbsp; a law&nbsp; must carry the&nbsp; burden&nbsp; of showing that it does not&nbsp; rest&nbsp; upon any&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; basis, but is essentially arbitrary.'"<br></blockquote><blockquote><i>c. Authorities&nbsp; recognizing&nbsp;&nbsp; citizenship&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; basis&nbsp;&nbsp; for classification.—</i><br></blockquote>The&nbsp; question as&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; whether&nbsp; or&nbsp; not&nbsp; citizenship&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; a legal and valid ground&nbsp; for&nbsp; classification has already&nbsp; been affirmatively&nbsp; decided in&nbsp; this&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; in various courts in the United States.&nbsp; In the case of Smith Bell &amp;&nbsp; Co.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Natividad, 40 Phil,&nbsp; 136, where&nbsp; the validity of&nbsp; Act&nbsp; No. 2761&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Legislature&nbsp; was&nbsp; in issue, because&nbsp; of&nbsp; a&nbsp; condition therein limiting&nbsp; the ownership of vessels engaged in coastwise trade&nbsp; to corporations formed by citizens of the Philippine Islands or the United States,&nbsp; thus denying the&nbsp; right&nbsp; to&nbsp; aliens, it was&nbsp; held&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Philippine Legislature did&nbsp; not&nbsp; violate the equal&nbsp; protection clause of the Philippine Bill of Rights.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legislature&nbsp; in&nbsp; enacting the&nbsp; law&nbsp; had&nbsp; as ultimate purpose the encouragement of Philippine shipbuilding and the safety for these&nbsp; Islands from foreign interlopers.&nbsp; We&nbsp; held that this&nbsp; was&nbsp; a&nbsp; valid exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; the police&nbsp; power,&nbsp; and&nbsp; all presumptions&nbsp; are in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; constitutionality.&nbsp;&nbsp; In substance, we&nbsp; held that the&nbsp; limitation&nbsp; of domestic ownership&nbsp; of vessels engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; coastwise trade&nbsp; to&nbsp; citizens of the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; does not violate&nbsp; the equal&nbsp; protection of the law and due process of&nbsp; law&nbsp; clauses of the Philippine Bill&nbsp; of Rights.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; rendering&nbsp; said&nbsp; decision&nbsp; we quoted with approval the concurring opinion&nbsp; of&nbsp; Justice Johnson in the&nbsp; case of Gibbons <i>vs.</i> Ogden, 9 Wheat., I,&nbsp; as follows:<br><blockquote>" 'Licensing acts, intact, in legislation, are universally&nbsp; restraining acts;&nbsp; as, for&nbsp; example, acts licensing1 gaming houses, retailers of spirituous liquors,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The act, in this instance, is&nbsp; distinctly of that character, and forms part of an extensive system, the object of which is to encourage&nbsp; American shipping, and&nbsp; place them&nbsp; on an equal footing with, the shipping of other nations.&nbsp; Almost&nbsp; every commercial&nbsp; 'nation reserves to its own subjects a monopoly of its coasting trade;&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; countervailing privilege in favor&nbsp; of American snipping is contemplated,&nbsp; in the whole legislation of the United States on this subject.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is not&nbsp; to&nbsp; give the vessel&nbsp; an American character, that the license is granted; that effect has been correctly attributed to the act of her enrollment.&nbsp; But it is to confer on her American&nbsp; privileges, as contradistinguished&nbsp; from&nbsp; foreign; and to preserve the Government from fraud by foreigners; in surreptitiously intruding themselves&nbsp; into the American commercial marine,, as well as frauds upon the revenue&nbsp; in the trade coastwise, that&nbsp; this whole system&nbsp; is projected.' "<br></blockquote>The&nbsp; rule in general is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Aliens are raider no&nbsp; special&nbsp; constitutional protection&nbsp; which forbids n classification otherwise justified simply because the limitation of the&nbsp; class&nbsp; falls&nbsp; along&nbsp; the lines of nationality.&nbsp; That would be requiring a higher degree of protection for&nbsp; aliens&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; class than for similar classes&nbsp; of American citizens.&nbsp; Broadly speaking, the difference&nbsp; in status between citizens and aliens constitutes&nbsp; a basis for reasonable&nbsp; classification in&nbsp; the exercise of police power,"&nbsp; (2&nbsp; Am. Jur. 468-469.)<br></blockquote>In Commonwealth <i>vs.</i> Hana, 81 N. E. 149, (Massachusetts, 1907), a statute on the licensing of hawkers and peddlers, which provided that&nbsp; no one can&nbsp; obtain&nbsp; a license unless he&nbsp; is, or has declared his intention, to become a citizen of the United States, was&nbsp; held valid, for the&nbsp; following reason:&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; may&nbsp; seem wise to the legislature to&nbsp; limit the business of those who&nbsp; are&nbsp; supposed to have regard for' the&nbsp; welfare, good order and happiness of&nbsp; the&nbsp; community,&nbsp; and the court cannot question&nbsp; this judgment and conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; Bloomfield <i>vs. </i>State, 99 N.E.&nbsp; 309 (Ohio, 1912), a&nbsp; statute which prevented certain persons, among them aliens, from engaging in the traffic&nbsp; of liquors,&nbsp; was found not to be the result of race hatred, or in hospitality, or&nbsp; a&nbsp; deliberate purpose to&nbsp; discriminate,&nbsp; but&nbsp; was&nbsp; based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; belief&nbsp; that&nbsp; an&nbsp; alien cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; sufficiently&nbsp; acquainted with 'our institutions and&nbsp; our life as to enable him to&nbsp; appreciate the relation of&nbsp; this particular business to our entire social fabric", and was not, therefore, invalid. In&nbsp; Ohio ex&nbsp; rel. Clarke <i>vs. </i>Deckebach, 274 U.S. 392, 71 L. ed. 1115&nbsp; (1926), the U.&nbsp; S. Supreme Court had under consideration an ordinance of the city&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cincinnati prohibiting the issuance of licenses&nbsp; (pools and billiard rooms) to aliens.&nbsp; It held that&nbsp; plainly irrational&nbsp; discrimination against aliens is prohibited, but it&nbsp; does not follow that alien&nbsp; race and allegiance may not bear in some instances such&nbsp; a&nbsp; relation to&nbsp; a legitimate object of legislation as to&nbsp; be made the&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of&nbsp; permitted&nbsp; classification,&nbsp; and that it could not state&nbsp; that the legislation is clearly wrong; and that&nbsp; latitude&nbsp; must&nbsp; be allowed for&nbsp; the&nbsp; legislative appraisement of local conditions and for the legislative choice of methods for controlling an apprehended evil.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case of State&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Carrol,&nbsp; 124 N. E. 129&nbsp; (Ohio,&nbsp; 1919)&nbsp; is a parallel case to&nbsp; the one at bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Asakura, <i>vs. </i>City of Seattle,&nbsp; 210&nbsp; P.&nbsp; SO (Washington,&nbsp; 1922),&nbsp; the&nbsp; business of pawnbroking was&nbsp; considered as having tendencies&nbsp; injuring public interest, and limiting it to citizens is within the scope&nbsp; of police&nbsp; power.&nbsp; A&nbsp; similar&nbsp; statute&nbsp; denying aliens the right to engage in auctioneering was also sustained in Wright <i>vs.</i> May, L. R. A., 1915 P. 151 (Minnesota, 1914).&nbsp;&nbsp; So also in Anton<i> vs.</i>&nbsp; Van Winkle,&nbsp; 297&nbsp; V. 340 (Oregon, 1924), the court said&nbsp; that aliens are judicially known&nbsp; to have different&nbsp; interests, knowledge,&nbsp; attitude, psychology and loyalty, hence the prohibition of issuance of licenses to them for the business of pawnbroker, pool, billiard, card room, dance hall,&nbsp; is not&nbsp; an infringement of constitutional rights. In Templar <i>vs.</i> Michigan State Board of Examiners,&nbsp; 90 N.W.&nbsp; 1058&nbsp; (Michigan,&nbsp; 1902),&nbsp; a law prohibiting the licensing&nbsp; of&nbsp; aliens as barbers&nbsp; was&nbsp; held void, but&nbsp; the&nbsp; reason&nbsp; for the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; court's finding that the exercise of the business&nbsp; by the aliens does not in any&nbsp; way&nbsp; affect the morals,&nbsp; the health, or even the convenience&nbsp; of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Takahashi <i>vs.</i> Fish and Game Commission, 92 L. ed. 1479&nbsp; (1947), a&nbsp; California statute banning the issuance of commercial fishing&nbsp; licenses to&nbsp; persons ineligible&nbsp; to&nbsp; citizenship&nbsp; was held&nbsp; void, because the law conflicts with&nbsp; Federal power over&nbsp; immigration, and&nbsp; because there is no public interest in the&nbsp; mere claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; ownership' of the waters and the fish&nbsp; in&nbsp; them,&nbsp; so there&nbsp; was no&nbsp; adequate justification for the&nbsp; discrimination.&nbsp; It further&nbsp;&nbsp; added&nbsp; that the law&nbsp; was the outgrowth&nbsp; of antagonism toward persons of Japanese ancestry.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, two Justices dissented&nbsp; on the theory that&nbsp; fishing rights have been&nbsp; treated&nbsp; traditionally as natural resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; Fraser&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; McConway &amp;&nbsp; Tarley Co.,&nbsp; 82&nbsp; Fed. 257 (Pennsylvania,&nbsp; 1897), a state law which imposed a tax on&nbsp; every employer&nbsp; of foreign-born unnaturalized male persons over 21 years&nbsp; of age, was declared void because the&nbsp; court found that there was no reason for the&nbsp; classification and the tax was an arbitrary deduction from the&nbsp; daily&nbsp; wage&nbsp; of an&nbsp; employee.<br><blockquote><i>d.&nbsp; Authorities contra explained.—</i><br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; true that some&nbsp; decisions of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Federal court and&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; State&nbsp; courts&nbsp; in the&nbsp; United States hold that the distinction&nbsp; between aliens and citizens is&nbsp; not a valid ground for classification.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in these decisions the laws declared&nbsp; invalid&nbsp; were found to be either arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious,&nbsp; or were the result or product of racial antagonism and&nbsp; hostility,&nbsp; and&nbsp; there&nbsp; was&nbsp; no question&nbsp; of public interest&nbsp; involved or pursued.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; Yu Cong Eng <i>vs. </i>Trinidad, 70 L. ed. 1059 (1925), the United States Supreme&nbsp; Court declared&nbsp; invalid a&nbsp; Philippine law making unlawful the keeping of books of account in any language&nbsp; other than&nbsp; English, Spanish or&nbsp; any other local dialect, but the main reasons for the decisions are: (1) that if Chinese&nbsp; were driven out&nbsp; of business there would be no other&nbsp; system of&nbsp; distribution, and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that the Chinese1&nbsp; would fall&nbsp; prey&nbsp; to all&nbsp; kinds of&nbsp; fraud, because they&nbsp; would be deprived&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; right to be advised of their business and to direct&nbsp; its conduct.&nbsp; The real reason for the decision, therefore,&nbsp; is the court's&nbsp; belief that no public benefit would&nbsp; be&nbsp; derived from&nbsp; the&nbsp; operation of the law and&nbsp; on the&nbsp; other hand&nbsp; it would deprive Chinese of something indispensable for carrying on their business. In Yick Wo <i>vs.</i> Hopkins, 30 L. ed. 220&nbsp; (1885)&nbsp; an ordinance conferring power on officials to&nbsp; withhold&nbsp; consent in the operation of&nbsp; laundries both&nbsp; as to persons and place, was declared&nbsp; invalid, but the&nbsp; court said that the power granted was&nbsp; arbitrary, that there was no reason for&nbsp; the discrimination which&nbsp; attended the administration&nbsp; and implementation of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law, and that&nbsp; the&nbsp; motive thereof was mere racial hostility.&nbsp; In&nbsp; State <i>vs. </i> Montgomery, 47 A. 165 (Maine,&nbsp; 1900),&nbsp; a&nbsp; law prohibiting aliens&nbsp; to engage as hawkers&nbsp;&nbsp; and peddlers was&nbsp; declared&nbsp; void,&nbsp; because the discrimination bore&nbsp; no&nbsp; reasonable and&nbsp; just relation to the act in respect to which the classification was&nbsp; proposed. The case at bar&nbsp; is radically different,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the facts make&nbsp; them so.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we&nbsp; already have said, aliens do, not naturally possess the sympathetic consideration and regard for&nbsp; customers with&nbsp; whom&nbsp; they come&nbsp; in&nbsp; daily contact, nor&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; patriotic&nbsp; desire to&nbsp; help bolster&nbsp; the&nbsp; nation's economy,&nbsp; except in&nbsp; so&nbsp; far&nbsp; as&nbsp; it enhances&nbsp; their&nbsp; profit, nor the&nbsp; loyalty and allegiance&nbsp; which the&nbsp; national&nbsp; owes to&nbsp; the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; These limitations&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; qualifications of aliens have been shown on&nbsp; many occasions&nbsp; and&nbsp; instances, especially in&nbsp; times of&nbsp; crisis and emergency.&nbsp; We can do no better than&nbsp; borrow the language&nbsp; of Anton<i> vs.</i> "Van Winkle,&nbsp; 297 F.&nbsp; 340, 342, to&nbsp; drive home the reality and significance of&nbsp; the distinction between the&nbsp; alien and the national, thus:<br><blockquote>"* * *.&nbsp; It may be judicially&nbsp; known, however, that aliens&nbsp; coming into this country are without the intimate knowledge of our laws, customs,&nbsp; and usages that&nbsp; our own, people have. So it is likewise known that certain, classes&nbsp; of aliens are of different psychology from our fellow countrymen.&nbsp; Furthermore, it is natural&nbsp; and reasonable to suppose that the foreign born,&nbsp; whose allegiance&nbsp; is first to their own country, and whose ideals of governmental environment and control have been engendered and formed under entirely different regimes and political systems, have not&nbsp; the same inspiration for the public weal, nor are&nbsp; they as&nbsp; well disposed&nbsp; toward the United States, as those who&nbsp; by citizenship, are a part of the government itself.&nbsp; Further enlargement, is unnecessary.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have&nbsp; said enough so that obviously it cannot&nbsp; be affirmed with absolute confidence that the&nbsp; Legislature was without plausible reason for&nbsp; making the classification, and therefore appropriate discrimination&nbsp; against aliens&nbsp; as it relates&nbsp; to&nbsp; the subject of legislation. * *&nbsp; *."<br></blockquote><center><i>VII The Due Process of Law Limitation<br></i><blockquote><div align="left"><i>a.

Petitioner's argument&nbsp; considered.—</i><br></blockquote>Petitioner's main argument is that retail is a common, ordinary occupation, one of those&nbsp; privileges long ago recognized as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men; that it is a gainful and&nbsp; honest occupation and therefore beyond the&nbsp; power&nbsp; of the&nbsp; legislature&nbsp; to prohibit and&nbsp; penalize.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; argument&nbsp; overlooks&nbsp; fact and reality and rests on&nbsp; an&nbsp; incorrect assumption and premise, i.e.,&nbsp; that&nbsp; in this country&nbsp; where&nbsp; the occupation is engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; by petitioner, it has been&nbsp; so&nbsp; engaged by him, by the alien, in an honest creditable and unimpeachable manner, without harm&nbsp; or injury to the&nbsp; citizens and without ultimate danger to&nbsp; their economic peace, tranquility and welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the&nbsp; Legislature has&nbsp; found,&nbsp; as we have also&nbsp; found and indicated, that the 'privilege has been so grossly abused by the&nbsp; alien, thru the illegitimate use of pernicious designs and practices, that he now enjoys a monopolistic control of the occupation and threatens a&nbsp; deadly&nbsp; stranglehold on&nbsp; the nation's&nbsp; economy&nbsp; endangering the national&nbsp; security in times of crisis and emergency. &nbsp;<br><br>The real question at issue, therefore, is&nbsp; not that posed by petitioner,&nbsp; which&nbsp; overlooks&nbsp; and&nbsp; ignores&nbsp; the&nbsp; facts and circumstances,&nbsp; but this,&nbsp; Is the&nbsp; exclusion in the future of aliens&nbsp; from the retail trade&nbsp; unreasonable,&nbsp; arbitrary and capricious, taking into account the&nbsp; illegitimate and&nbsp; pernicious form and manner in which the aliens have heretofore&nbsp; engaged therein?&nbsp; As thus&nbsp; correctly&nbsp; stated the answer is clear.&nbsp; The law in question is deemed absolutely necessary to bring about the desired legislative objective, i.e., to free national&nbsp; economy from alien&nbsp; control and dominance.&nbsp; It is not&nbsp; necessarily unreasonable&nbsp; because&nbsp; it affects private rights and. privileges&nbsp; (11&nbsp; Am. Jur. pp. 1080-1081.)&nbsp; The test of reasonableness of a law is the appropriateness or adequacy under&nbsp; all circumstances of the means adopted to carry out its purpose&nbsp; into effect (Id.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Judged&nbsp; by this test, disputed legislation, which&nbsp; is not&nbsp; merely reasonable but actually necessary,&nbsp; must be considered not to&nbsp; have infringed the constitutional limitation of reasonableness.<br><br>The&nbsp; necessity&nbsp; of the&nbsp; law&nbsp; in question&nbsp; is&nbsp; explained&nbsp; in the&nbsp; explanatory&nbsp; note&nbsp; that accompanied&nbsp; the&nbsp; bill,&nbsp; which later was&nbsp; enacted&nbsp; into&nbsp; law:<br><blockquote>"This&nbsp; bill&nbsp; proposes to&nbsp; regulate&nbsp; the&nbsp; retail business.&nbsp; Its purpose is to prevent persons who are not citizens of&nbsp; the Philippines from having a strangle hold upon our economic life.&nbsp; If the persons who control this vital artery of our&nbsp; economic life are the ones who owe no allegiance to this Republic, who have no profound devotion to our free institutions, and who have&nbsp; no permanent&nbsp; stake&nbsp; in our people's welfare,&nbsp; we are&nbsp; not&nbsp; really&nbsp; the masters&nbsp; of our own destiny. All aspects of our life, even our national security, will be at the mercy of other people.<br><br>"In seeking to accomplish the foregoing purpose, we do not propose to deprive persons who are not citizens of the Philippines of their means of livelihood.&nbsp;&nbsp; While this bill seeks to&nbsp; take&nbsp; away from the hands of persons who are not&nbsp; citizens&nbsp; of the Philippines&nbsp; a power that can&nbsp; bo wielded to paralyze all aspects of&nbsp; our national life and endanger our national&nbsp; security it respects existing rights.<br><br>"The approval of this bill is ¦necessary for our national survival."</blockquote>If&nbsp; political&nbsp; independence is&nbsp; a&nbsp; legitimate&nbsp; aspiration&nbsp; of a&nbsp; people,&nbsp; then&nbsp; economic independence&nbsp; is none the less legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom&nbsp; and liberty&nbsp; are not real and positive if the&nbsp; people&nbsp; are&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; economic control and domination&nbsp; of&nbsp; others,&nbsp; especially if not of their own race or country.&nbsp; . The removal and eradication of the shackles of foreign&nbsp; economic&nbsp; control&nbsp; and&nbsp; domination,,&nbsp; is&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the noblest motives&nbsp; that a national legislature may pursue. It is impossible&nbsp; to conceive&nbsp;&nbsp; that legislation that&nbsp; seeks to bring it about can infringe the&nbsp; constitutional limitation of due&nbsp; process..&nbsp; The&nbsp; attainment&nbsp; of a.&nbsp; legitimate&nbsp; aspiration of a people can never&nbsp; be beyond the limits of&nbsp; legislative&nbsp; authority.<br><blockquote><i>c. Law&nbsp; expressly held&nbsp; by Constitutional .Convention&nbsp; to be within the sphere&nbsp; of&nbsp; legislative action.—</i><br></blockquote>The framers&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Constitution could not have intended&nbsp; to&nbsp; impose&nbsp; the constitutional restrictions of due process&nbsp; on&nbsp; the attainment of&nbsp; such&nbsp; a noble&nbsp; motive as freedom from economic control&nbsp; and domination,&nbsp; thru the exercise of&nbsp; the police&nbsp; power.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fathers&nbsp; of the . Constitution must have given to the legislature full authority and power to&nbsp; enact legislation that&nbsp; would&nbsp; promote the supreme happiness of the people, their freedom and liberty. On the precise issue now before us, they&nbsp; expressly made their voice clear;&nbsp; they adopted a&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; expressing their belief that the legislation&nbsp; in question is&nbsp; within the scope&nbsp; of the&nbsp; legislative&nbsp; power.&nbsp; Thus&nbsp; they&nbsp; declared' in their Resolution:<br><blockquote>" 'That it is the sense of the Convention that the public interest requires the nationalization of retail trade; but&nbsp; it abstains from approving the amendment introduced by the Delegate for Manila, Mr. Araneta, and others on this matter because it is convinced that the National Assembly is&nbsp; authorized to promulgate a&nbsp; law which&nbsp; limits to Filipino and&nbsp; American&nbsp; citizens&nbsp; the privilege&nbsp; to&nbsp; engage&nbsp; in the retail trade.' "&nbsp; (II Aruego, The Framing of the Philippine Constitution, 662-663, quoted on pages 66 and 67 of the&nbsp; Memorandum for the Petitioner.)<br></blockquote>It would do&nbsp; well&nbsp; to&nbsp; refer to the nationalistic tendency manifested in various provisions of the Constitution.&nbsp; Thus in the preamble, a&nbsp; principal objective is the&nbsp; conservation of the patrimony of the&nbsp; nation and as corollary thereto the provision&nbsp; limiting&nbsp; to citizens of the Philippines the exploitation,&nbsp; development and&nbsp; utilization&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; natural resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 8&nbsp; of Article XIV, it is provided that&nbsp; "no franchise, certificate,&nbsp; or any&nbsp; other&nbsp; form of authorization for the operation of a public utility&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; granted except&nbsp; to citizens&nbsp; of the Philippines."&nbsp; The. nationalization of&nbsp; the retail trade is&nbsp; only&nbsp; a continuance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; nationalistic protective&nbsp; policy&nbsp; laid&nbsp; down&nbsp; as&nbsp; a primary objective&nbsp; of the Constitution.&nbsp; Can&nbsp; it be&nbsp; said that&nbsp; a&nbsp; law&nbsp; imbued&nbsp; with the&nbsp; same purpose&nbsp; and&nbsp; spirit underlying&nbsp; many of the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Constitution is unreasonable, invalid&nbsp; and unconstitutional?<br><br>The seriousness&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Legislature's concern for&nbsp; the plight of&nbsp; the ' nationals&nbsp; as manifested in the&nbsp; approval of the radical measure is,&nbsp; therefore, fully justified.&nbsp; It would have been recreant to&nbsp; its duties towards the country and&nbsp; its&nbsp; people&nbsp; would&nbsp; it&nbsp; view the&nbsp; sorry&nbsp; plight of&nbsp; the nationals with complacency and refuse or neglect to adopt a remedy commensurate with the demands of public interest and national survival.&nbsp; As the&nbsp; repository of&nbsp; the sovereign power of&nbsp; legislation, the&nbsp; Legislature&nbsp; was&nbsp; in duty bound&nbsp; to face the problem and meet, through adequate measures, the danger and threat that alien domination&nbsp; of&nbsp; retail trade poses to national economy.<br><blockquote><i>d.&nbsp; Provisions of&nbsp; law&nbsp; not unreasonable.—.</i><br></blockquote>A cursory study of the provisions of the law immediately reveals how tolerant, how reasonable the Legislature has been.&nbsp; The law&nbsp; is&nbsp; made prospective&nbsp; and&nbsp; recognizes the right and privilege of&nbsp; those already&nbsp; engaged in&nbsp; the&nbsp; occupation to continue therein during the rest of their lives; and similar&nbsp; recognition of the right to&nbsp; continue&nbsp; is&nbsp; accorded&nbsp; associations&nbsp; of&nbsp; alians.&nbsp; The right&nbsp; or privilege&nbsp; is denied to&nbsp; those only&nbsp; upon conviction of certain offenses. In the deliberations of&nbsp; the Court on&nbsp; this&nbsp; case, attention was called to the fact that the privilege should not have been&nbsp; denied&nbsp; to children and&nbsp; heirs of aliens now engaged in the retail trade.&nbsp; Such provision would&nbsp; defeat the law itself, its&nbsp; aims and purposes.&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp; the exercise of legislative discretion&nbsp; is not&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; review. It is well settled that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court will&nbsp; not&nbsp; inquire&nbsp; into the motives&nbsp; of the Legislature,&nbsp; nor&nbsp; pass&nbsp; upon&nbsp; general matters of legislative&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legislature is&nbsp; primarily&nbsp; the judge of&nbsp; the&nbsp; necessity of an&nbsp; enactment or of&nbsp; any of its provisions,&nbsp; and every presumption is in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; its&nbsp; validity,&nbsp; and&nbsp; though the&nbsp; Court may hold views inconsistent with the&nbsp; wisdom of the law, it may not annul the legislation if not palpably in excess of the legislative&nbsp; power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; the test&nbsp; of the&nbsp; validity of a&nbsp; law attacked&nbsp; as a violation&nbsp; of due&nbsp; process, is not its&nbsp; reasonableness,&nbsp; but&nbsp; its,&nbsp; unreasonableness,&nbsp; and&nbsp; we&nbsp; find the&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; unreasonable.&nbsp; These&nbsp; principles also answer&nbsp; various other arguments raised against the law, some of which are:&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; law does not&nbsp; promote general welfare; that thousands of aliens would be thrown out&nbsp; of employment; that&nbsp; prices will increase because of the elimination of competition; that there is no need for the legislation; that adequate replacement is problematical; that there may be&nbsp; general breakdown; that there&nbsp; would be&nbsp; repercussions&nbsp; from&nbsp; foreigners;&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; Many&nbsp; of these arguments are&nbsp; directed against the supposed&nbsp; wisdom of the law which lies solely within the legislative prerogative; they&nbsp; do&nbsp; not import invalidity.<br><blockquote>VIII. <i>Alleged defect in&nbsp; the title of the law</i><br></blockquote>A subordinate ground or reason for the alleged invalidity of the law is the claim that the title thereof&nbsp; is misleading or&nbsp; deceptive, as it&nbsp; conceals the real purpose of&nbsp; the bill, which is to&nbsp; nationalize the retail&nbsp; business&nbsp; and&nbsp; prohibit aliens from engaging therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; The constitutional provision which is claimed to be violated in Section 21 (1)&nbsp; of Article VI, which reads:<br><blockquote>"No bill which may be enacted into law shall embrace more than one subject which shall be expressed in the title of&nbsp; the bill."<br></blockquote>What the above provision prohibits is duplicity, that is, if its title completely fails to apprise the legislators&nbsp; or the public of the nature, scope and consequences of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law or its operation (I Sutherland, Statutory Construction, Sec. 1707, p. 297.)&nbsp;&nbsp; A cursory consideration of&nbsp; the&nbsp; title and the&nbsp; provisions of the bill&nbsp; fails to&nbsp; show&nbsp; the presence of duplicity.&nbsp; It is true that the term "regulate" does not and may not readily and at first glance convey the idea of "nationalization" and "prohibition", which terms express the two main&nbsp; purposes&nbsp; and&nbsp; objectives&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law. But "regulate" is a broader term&nbsp; than&nbsp; either prohibition&nbsp; or nationalization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of these&nbsp; have always been included within the term regulation.<br><blockquote>"Under the. title of an act to 'regulate', the sale of&nbsp; intoxicating liquors, the Legislature may prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors." (Sweet <i>vs. </i>City of Wabash, 41 Ind., 7; quoted in page AX of Answer.)<br><br>"Within the meaning of the Constitution requiring that the subject of every act of the Legislature shall he stated in the title, the title 'To&nbsp; regulate&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale of intoxicating&nbsp; liquors, etc." sufficiently expresses the subject of an act prohibiting the sale of such&nbsp; liquors to minors&nbsp; and to persons&nbsp; in&nbsp; the habit of&nbsp; getting intoxicated;&nbsp; such matters being&nbsp; properly included within the subject of regulating the sale."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Williams <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; State, 48&nbsp; Ind.&nbsp; 306, 308, quoted in p. 42&nbsp; of Answer.)<br><br>"The word&nbsp; 'regulate' is of broad import, and necessarily <i> implies some degree&nbsp; of&nbsp; restraint</i> and prohibition of acts&nbsp; usually done&nbsp; in connection with&nbsp; the&nbsp; thing to be regulated.&nbsp; While word regulate' does not ordinarily convey meaning of prohibit, there is&nbsp; no absolute reason why it should not have such meaning when used in delegating police power in connection with a thing the best or only&nbsp; efficacious regulation of which involves suppression."&nbsp; (State<i>&nbsp; vs.</i> Morton, 162 So. 718, 182 La. 887,&nbsp; quoted in p. 42 of Answer.)<br></blockquote>The general rule is for the&nbsp; use of general terms, in the title of a bill; it has&nbsp; also been said&nbsp; that the title need not be an index to the entire contents of&nbsp; the&nbsp; law (I Sutherland, Statutory Construction, Sec. 4803, p. 345.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The above rule was followed when the title of the Act in question adopted the&nbsp; more general term&nbsp; "regulate" instead of&nbsp; "nationalize" or "prohibit".&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore,&nbsp; the law also contains other rules for the regulation of the retail trade, which may not be included in the terms&nbsp; "nationalization" or "prohibition"; so were the title changed from "regulate" to&nbsp; "nationalize" or "prohibit", there would have been&nbsp; many provisions not falling within the scope of the title which would have made the&nbsp; Act&nbsp; invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of&nbsp; the term&nbsp; "regulate", therefore, is in accord with the principle governing the drafting of statutes,&nbsp; under which a simple or&nbsp; general term should be adopted in the title, which would include all other provisions found&nbsp; in the body of the Act.<br><br>One purpose of the constitutional directive that the subject of a bill should be embraced in its title is to&nbsp; apprise the legislators of the purposes,&nbsp; the nature and scope of its provisions, and prevent the enactment into law of&nbsp; matters which have not received the notice, action and study of the legislators or of the public.&nbsp; In the case at bar it cannot be claimed&nbsp; that the legislators have not been apprised of the nature&nbsp; of the law, especially the nationalization and prohibition&nbsp; provisions.&nbsp; The legislators took active interest in the discussion of the law, and a great many of the persons affected by the prohibition in the law conducted a campaign against its approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot be claimed, therefore, that the reasons&nbsp; for declaring the law invalid ever existed.&nbsp; The objection must therefore, be overruled.<br><br><center> IX. <i>Alleged violation of international treaties and obligations </i></center><br>Another subordinate argument against the validity&nbsp; of the law is the supposed violation thereby of the Charter of the United Nations and of&nbsp; the Declaration of Human Eights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. We find no merit in&nbsp; the&nbsp; above&nbsp; contention.&nbsp; The&nbsp; United Nations Charter imposes no strict or legal obligations regarding the rights and freedom of their&nbsp; subjects (Hans Kelsen, The Law of the United Nations, 1951 ed. pp. 29- 32), and the Declaration of Human Rights contains nothing more&nbsp; than a mere&nbsp; recommendation, or a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations (Id.&nbsp; p. 39.) That&nbsp; such is the import of&nbsp; the United Nations Charter aid of the Declaration of Human Rights can be inferred from the fact that members of the United Nations Organization, such&nbsp; as Norway and&nbsp; Denmark, prohibit&nbsp; foreigners from engaging in retail&nbsp; trade,&nbsp; and in most nations of the world laws&nbsp; against&nbsp; foreigners engaged in domestic&nbsp; trade are adopted.<br><br>The Treaty of Amity between the Republic of the Philippines and&nbsp; the Republic of China of April 18, 1947 is also claimed, to be violated by the law in question.&nbsp; All that the treaty guarantees&nbsp; is equality of treatment to the Chinese nationals&nbsp; "upon the same&nbsp; terms as the nationals of any other&nbsp; country."&nbsp; But the nationals of China&nbsp; are not discriminated against because nationals of all other countries, except those of the United States, who are granted special rights by the Constitution, are all prohibited from engaging in the retail trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even supposing that the law infringes upon the said treaty, the treaty is always subject to qualification or amendment by&nbsp; a&nbsp; subsequent law (U. S. <i>vs. </i>Thompson, 258, Fed. 257, 260), and the same may never curtail&nbsp; or restrict the scope of the&nbsp; police&nbsp; power of the State (Palston <i>vs. </i> Pennsylvania, 58 L. ed. 539.)<br><br><center> X. <i>Conclusion </i></center><br>Resuming what we have set forth above we hold that the disputed&nbsp; law was enacted to remedy a real&nbsp; actual threat and danger to&nbsp; national economy posed by alien dominance and control of the retail business&nbsp; and free citizens and country from such dominance and control; that the enactment clearly falls within the scope&nbsp; of the police power of the&nbsp; State, thru which and by&nbsp; which&nbsp; it&nbsp; protects its own personality and insures its security and future; that the law does not violate&nbsp; the equal protection&nbsp; clause&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Constitution because sufficient grounds exist for the distinction&nbsp; between alien and citizen&nbsp; in the exercise&nbsp; of&nbsp; the occupation regulated,&nbsp; nor the&nbsp; due&nbsp; process of law&nbsp; clause, because the law is prospective in operation and recognizes the&nbsp; privilege of aliens already engaged in the occupation and reasonably protects their privilege;&nbsp; that the&nbsp; wisdom and efficacy of the law to carry out its objectives appear to us to be plainly evident—as a matter of fact it seems not only appropriate but actually necessary—and that in any case such matter falls within the prerogative of the Legislature, with whose power and discretion the Judicial&nbsp; department of the&nbsp; Government may not interfere; that&nbsp; the provisions of the law&nbsp; are clearly embraced in the title, and&nbsp; this suffers from no&nbsp; duplicity and has not misled&nbsp; the legislators or the segment of the population affected; and that it cannot be&nbsp; said to be void for supposed conflict with treaty obligations because no treaty has actually been&nbsp; entered into on the subject&nbsp; and the police power may not be&nbsp; curtailed or surrendered by any treaty or any other conventional agreement.<br><br>Some members of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; are of&nbsp; the opinion that the&nbsp; radical effects&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law could&nbsp; have been made&nbsp; less harsh in&nbsp; its impact on the aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is stated that more time should&nbsp; have been given in the law for the liquidation of existing&nbsp; businesses when the time comes for them to dose.&nbsp; Our legal duty, however, is merely to determine if the law falls within the scope of legislative authority&nbsp; and&nbsp; does not transcend&nbsp; the limitations&nbsp; of due process and equal&nbsp; protection&nbsp; guaranteed&nbsp; in the Constitution. Remedies&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; harshness&nbsp; of the law&nbsp; should&nbsp; be addressed&nbsp; to the Legislature; they are beyond our&nbsp; power and jurisdiction.<br><br>The petition is hereby denied, with costs against petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Reyes, A., Bautista Angela, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B.

agree to the proposition, principle or rule&nbsp; that&nbsp; courts may not Inquire&nbsp; into the wisdom of an Act passed by the Congress&nbsp; and duly approved&nbsp; by the&nbsp; President of the Republic.&nbsp; But the rule&nbsp; does not preclude courts&nbsp; from&nbsp; inquiring and determining whether the Act offends against a provision or provisions of the Constitution.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am satisfied&nbsp; that the Act assailed as&nbsp; violative of the due process of law and the equal protection of&nbsp; the laws clauses&nbsp; of the Constitution does not&nbsp; infringe&nbsp; upon them, insofar as&nbsp; it affects&nbsp; associations,&nbsp; partnerships&nbsp;&nbsp; or corporations,&nbsp; the capital&nbsp; of which is not&nbsp; wholly owned by citizens of the Philippines,&nbsp; and aliens,&nbsp; who&nbsp; are not and&nbsp; have&nbsp; not been engaged in the retail business.&nbsp; I am, however,&nbsp; unable to persuade myself that it does not violate&nbsp; said clauses insofar as the&nbsp; Act applies&nbsp; to&nbsp; associations&nbsp; and partnerships referred to in&nbsp; "the&nbsp; Act' and to aliens, who are&nbsp; and have heretofore been engaged in said business;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they did engage in the retail business there was no prohibition on or against them to&nbsp; engage in it.&nbsp; They assumed and believed in good faith they were entitled to engage&nbsp; in the business.&nbsp; The Act&nbsp; allows aliens to continue in business until their death or voluntary retirement from the business or forfeiture of their&nbsp; license; and corporations, associations or partnerships,&nbsp; the capital&nbsp; of which is&nbsp; not&nbsp; wholly owned&nbsp; by citizens of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; to&nbsp; continue&nbsp; in the business for a period&nbsp; of ten years from the date&nbsp; of the approval of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Act (19 June 19S4)&nbsp; or until&nbsp; the&nbsp; expiry of the&nbsp; term of the existence of the association or partnership&nbsp; or corporation, whichever&nbsp; event comes first.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prohibition on corporations, the capital of which&nbsp; is not wholly&nbsp; owned by citizens of the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; to engage in the&nbsp; retail business for a&nbsp; period of more than ten years from the date of the approval of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Act or&nbsp; beyond the term of&nbsp; their corporate existence,&nbsp; whichever event comes first, is&nbsp; valid and lawful, because&nbsp; the&nbsp; continuance&nbsp; of the existence of such corporations is subject to whatever the Congress may impose reasonably upon them by subsequent legislation<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> But the prohibition to engage&nbsp; in the retail business by&nbsp; associations&nbsp; and partnerships, the capital of which is not wholly owned by citizens&nbsp; of the Philippines, after ten years from the date of the approval&nbsp; of the Act, even before the end of the term of their existence as&nbsp; agreed upon by the&nbsp; associates&nbsp; and partners, and by alien heirs to whom the retail business is transmitted by the death of an alien engaged&nbsp; in the business, or&nbsp; by his executor&nbsp; or administrator,&nbsp; amounts to&nbsp; a deprivation of their property without&nbsp; due process of law.&nbsp; To&nbsp; my&nbsp; mind,&nbsp; the ten-year period from the date of the approval of the Act or until the expiration of the term of the existence of the association and&nbsp; partnership, whichever event comes first, and the six-month&nbsp; period granted&nbsp; to&nbsp; alien heirs of a deceased alien, his&nbsp; executor&nbsp; or administrator,&nbsp; to&nbsp; liquidate the business, do not cure the defect of the law, because the effect of the prohibition is to compel them to sell or dispose of their business.&nbsp; The price obtainable&nbsp; at&nbsp; such forced sale of the business would be inadequate to&nbsp; reimburse and compensate the&nbsp; associates or partners of the&nbsp; association or&nbsp; partnership, and the alien heirs of a deceased alien, engaged in the retail business for the capital invested in it.&nbsp; The stock of merchandise bought and sold at retail does not alone constitute&nbsp; the business.&nbsp; The goodwill that&nbsp; the&nbsp; association, partnership and the alien had built&nbsp; up during a long period of effort,&nbsp; patience and perseverance forms part of such business.&nbsp; The constitutional&nbsp; provisions&nbsp; that no person shall be deprived of his property without due process of law <font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> and that no person shall be denied the equal protection of&nbsp; the laws<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font> would have no meaning as applied to associations&nbsp; or partnerships and alien heirs of an alien engaged in the retail business if they were to be compelled to sell or dispose of their business&nbsp; within&nbsp; ten&nbsp; years from the&nbsp; date of the approval of the Act and&nbsp; before the end of the term of the existence of the&nbsp; associations and partnerships as agreed upon by the associates and partners and within&nbsp; six months after&nbsp; the death of their predecessor-in-interest.<br><br>The authors of the Constitution were vigilant, careful and zealous in the safeguard of the ownership of private agricultural lands which together with&nbsp; the lands of the&nbsp; public domain constitute the priceless patrimony and mainstay of the nation; yet, they did not deem&nbsp; it wise&nbsp; and prudent to deprive&nbsp; aliens and their&nbsp; heirs of&nbsp; such lands.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[3]</sup></font><br><br>For these&nbsp; reasons, I&nbsp; am of the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; that section 1 of the&nbsp; Act, insofar as&nbsp; it compels&nbsp; associations&nbsp; and partnerships referred to therein to wind&nbsp; ujp their retail business within ten years from the date of the approval of the Act even&nbsp; before the expiry of the term of their existence as agreed upon&nbsp; by the associates and partners&nbsp; and section 3 of the Act, insofar as it compels the&nbsp; alien heirs of a deceased alien engaged in the retail business in his lifetime, his executor or administrator, to liquidate the business, are invalid, for they&nbsp; violate the due process of law and the equal protection of the laws clauses of the Constitution.<br><br><br><hr align="left" width="65%"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> Section 76, Act No. 1469.<br><br><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> Section 1(1),&nbsp;
