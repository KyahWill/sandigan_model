				<H3>NATIONAL COCONUT CORPORATION, PETITIONER VS. JUDGE FRANCISCO GERONIMO AND SAGRADA ORDEN DE PREDICADORES DEL SANTISIMO ROSARIO DE FILIPINAS, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERIA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> From the allegations in the complaint filed with the Municipal 
Court of the City of Manila (copy of which is attached to the petition) by the 
Sagrada Orden de Predicadores against the petitioner herein, it clearly appears, 
notwithstanding the plaintiff's contention, that the possession of the property 
in question by the Philippine Alien Property Custodian and of the petitioner to 
whom said possession was transferred by the said Custodian in August 1946, was 
in good faith (Arts. 434, 435, 436 and 1950 of the Civil Code); and it only lost 
its character as such when the Court of First Instance rendered judgment in 
Civil Case No. 5007 declaring null and void the sale of the property by the 
respondent Sagrada Orden de Predicadores to a Japanese corporation, from which 
the Philippine Alien Property Custodian, predecessor in interest of the 
petitioner, obtained the said property in accordance with law.
<p align="justify">Under Art. 451 of the Civil Code the fruits received by one in 
possession in good faith before the possession is legally interrupted, becomes 
his own (White vs. Williams &amp; Co., 5 Phil., 571), and the possession in good 
faith of the petitioner and its predecessor in interest, the Philippine Alien 
Property Custodian, was not interrupted upon the filing of the complaint 
against, arid service of summons upon, the latter; because the Philippine Alien 
Property Custodian was not the purchaser of the property and, under the 
circumstances, was not supposed to be aware of any vice which may have attended 
the sale of the property by the Sagrada Orden de Predicadores to the Japanese 
corporation. The possession of the petitioner lost its character of possession 
in good faith from the rendition of the judgment against the Philippine Alien 
Property Custodian, and the latter or his successor in interest is liable from 
that time to pay the rents or fruits of the property until the possession of the 
property has been delivered to the adjudged owner thereof.</p>
<p align="justify">The possession of the property by the petitioner became illegal 
only from the time she was notified or required by the Sagrada Orden de 
Predicadores to return said possession to it and the former failed to do so, 
because before said notice or demand was made the possession of the petitioner 
was legal or consented, to without prejudice to the obligation of said 
petitioner to pay the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the 
premises from the time the latter's possession ceased to be in good faith. From 
the notice to vacate the premises up to the filing of the complaint of illegal 
detainer against the petitioner by the respondent Sagrada Orden de Predicadores, 
one year had not elapsed, and therefore the respondent Municipal Judge or Court 
has jurisdiction to try and decide the case.</p>
<p align="justify">To uphold the contention of the dissenting opinion that the 
possession of the petitioner was illegal since August 1946, would be to hold 
that an action of illegal detainer could have been successfully instituted by 
the Sagrada Orden de Predicadores within one year from that date, that is, 
before the sale of the property by said Sagrada Orden de Predicadores to the 
Japanese corporation has been set aside, and therefore while the ownership 
thereof was still vested in the petitioner's predecessor in interest, which is 
absolutely untenable.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition for prohibition with preliminary injunction is 
therefore denied. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Montemayor,</i> and 
<i>A. Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i></p>
<p align="justify">PARAS, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">The complaint for ejectment filed in the Municipal Court admits 
that the plaintiff (respondent Sagrada Orden de Predicadores del Santisimo 
Rosario de Filipinas) has been deprived of the premises in question since 1946, 
and that the defendant (petitioner National Coconut Corporation) has had that 
possession since that year. The claim for P93,000 represents damages from 
August, 1946 to February, 1949. The result is that, under the very allegations 
of the complaint for ejectment, more than one year has elapsed between the 
commencement of the alleged illegal deprivation of possession and the filing of 
the complaint in the Municipal Court. The one-year period specified in the Rules 
of Court—that confers jurisdiction on the Municipal Court—does not refer to the 
time when a plaintiff in a forcible entry and detainer case shall have acquired 
proprietary rights, but principally to the possession of the actual occupant. If 
the respondent Sagrada Orden de Predicadores wanted the judgment in the case 
against the Philippine Alien Property Custodian to be binding against the 
petitioner, the latter should have been included as party defendant in the case. 
Again, the 5-day notice given to the defendant in an illegal detainer case 
refers to the class of persons expressly enumerated in section 2 of Rule of 
Court No. 72, to which the petitioner plainly does not belong.</p> <i>Perfecto, J.</i>, concurs in this dissent.<br></div>
