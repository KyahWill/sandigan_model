				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The election of Alejandro D. Uy to the office of municipal 
mayor of Manticao, Misamis Oriental, on November 13, 1951, brought the instant 
action of quo warranto in the Court of First Instance of that province. The 
petitioner was Laureto A. Talaroc, one of the defeated candidates for the same 
office, and the grounds of the petition were that the respondent is a Chinese 
national and therefore ineligible. The court below found the petition well 
founded and declared the position in question vacant. 
<p align="justify">The personal circumstances of the respondent as found by the 
court are not in dispute. They are as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Estan establecidas por las pruebas, y admitidas por las 
partes, que Alejandro D. Uy nacio en enero 28, 1912, en el municipio de Iligan, 
provincia de Lanao (Exhibito A), de padre chino, Uy Piangco, y de raadre 
Filipina, Ursula Diabo, cuando convivian estos como marido y mujer, pero despues 
contrajeron matrimonio eclesiastico el marzo 3, 1914, en dicho pueblo (Exhibito 
9). Tuvieron siete hijos, siendo el recurrido Alejandro D. Uy el 5.° hijo. Uy 
Piangeo nativo de Chuitao, Amoy, China, nunca se ausent6 desde que llego hacia 
1893 6 1895, en Filipinas hasta su fallecimiento el febrero 17, 1917, en Iligan, 
Lanao, donde estuvo residiendo continuamente. Ursula Diabo sin contraer nuevo 
matrimonio, murio con posterioridad, el agosto 29, 1949, en el munieipio de 
Mantieao, Misamis Oriental (Exhibito 3). Aparece tambien que el recurrido 
Alejandro D. Uy nunca fue a China y ha votado en las anteriores elecciones 
verificadas en el pals, y ha desempefiado empleos como Inspector del "Bureau of 
Plant Industry" en 1943 (Exh. 4), en los arios 1935, 1946 y 1947, maestro bajo 
el Bureaa of Public Schools, en Manticao District (Exhs. 5 y 50); filing clerk 
en ia Tesoreria Municipal de Initao, en 1935 al 1945 (Exh. 4); y acting 
Municipal Treasurer de Lagait, en 1942 a 1943 (Exh. 6); ademas de haber servido 
al 120th Infantry Regiment de la guerrila, y algun tiempo 'tax collector' del 
gobierno de ocupacion japonesa, en esta provincia de Misamis 
Oriental."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">These facts also appear uncontroverted in evidence: One of the 
respondent's brothers, Pedro D. Uy, before the war and up to this time has been 
occupying the position of income tax examiner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. 
His other brother, Jose D. Uy, is a practicing certified public accountant, and 
before the war was the accountant of the National Abaca and Fiber Corporation 
(NAFCO). His other brother, Dr. Victorio D. Uy, is a practising physician, and, 
before the war, was charity physician in Initao and later a physician in the 
provincial hospital. During the war, Dr. Uy was a captain in the Philippine 
Army. His younger brother was a lieutenant in the 120th Infantry Regiment of the 
guerrillas. All his brothers married Filipino girls and they were never 
identified with any Chinese political or social organization. Respondent's 
father acquired properties in Lugait. His mother, who never remarried, 
campaigned for woman suffrage in 1935 and voted in the subsequent elections.</p>
<p align="justify">The respondent's contentions, which the court below rejected, 
were that his father was a subject of Spain on April 11, 1899 by virtue of 
Article 17 of the Civil Code; that his mother <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> reacquired her Filipino 
citizenship upon the death of her husband on February 17, 1917, and the child 
followed her citizenship; and that the respondent is a citizen of the 
Philippines by the mere fact of his birth therein. His Honor the Judge noted 
that, while under the Roa doctrine (Roa vs. Insular Collector of Customs, 23 
Phil., 315), Alejandro D. Uy would be a Filipino citizen regardless of the 
nationality of his parents, yet, he said, this doctrine was abandoned in Tan 
Chong vs. Secretary of Labor, (79 Phil, 249), Swee Sang vs. The Commonwealth of 
the Philippines, (79 Phil., 249), decided with Tan Chong vs. Secretary of Labor 
and Villahermosa vs. The Commissioner of Immigration, 80 Phil., 541. </p>
<p align="justify">It may be recalled that in the case of Roa vs. Insular 
Collector of Customs, supra, the petitioner was born in lawful wedlock in the 
Philippines on July 6, 1899, his father being a native of China and his mother a 
Filipina. His father was domiciled in this country up to the year 1895 when he 
went to China and never returned, dying there about 1900. In May, 1901, Roa, who 
was then a minor, was sent to China by his widowed mother for the sole purpose 
of studying, and returned in October, 1910, being then about 21 years and 3 
months of age. He was denied admission by the board of special inquiry, whose 
decision was affirmed by the Court of First Instance in habeas corpus 
proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify">This Court held that Article 17 of the Civil Code "is 
sufficient to show that the first paragraph affirms and recognizes the principle 
of nationality by place of birth, <span style="font-style: italic;">jus soli</span>." Citing various decisions, 
authorities, and opinions of the United States Attorney General, it found that 
the decided weight of authority was to the effect that the marriage of an 
American woman with an alien conferred his nationality upon her during 
coverture; that upon the dissolution of the marriage by death of the husband, 
the wife reverted, <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>, to her former status, unless her conduct or acts 
showed that she elected to retain the nationality of her husband, and that where 
the widowed mother herself thus reacquired her former nationality, her children, 
she being their natural guardian, should follow her nationality with the <span style="font-style: italic;">proviso</span> 
that they may elect for themselves upon reaching majority.</p>
<p align="justify">The Roa decision, promulgated on October 30, 1912, set a 
precedent that was uniformly followed in numerous cases. This long line of 
decisions applied the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">jus soli </span>up to September 16, 1947, when that 
principle was renounced in the cases of Tan Chong vs. Secretary of Labor and 
Swee Sang vs. The Commonwealth of the Philippines cited in the appealed 
decision. </p>
<p align="justify">These two decisions are not, in our opinion, controlling in 
this case.</p>
<p align="justify">Article IV, entitled "Citizenship," of the Constitution 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SECTION 1. The following are citizens of the Philippines: </p>
<p align="justify">"(1) Those who are citizens of the Philippine Islands at the 
time of the adoption of this Constitution.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On the strength of the Roa doctrine, Alejandro D. Uy 
undoubtedly was considered a full-pledged Philippine citizen on the date of the 
adoption of the Constitution, when jus soli had been the prevailing doctrine. 
"With it," as Mr. Justice Laurel said in Ramon Torres et al. vs. Tan Chin, 69 
Phil., 519, "the bench and the bar were familiar. The members of the 
Constitutional Convention were also aware of this rule, and in abrogating the 
doctrine laid down in the Roa case, by making the <span style="font-style: italic;">jus sanguinis</span> the 
predominating principle in the determination of Philippine citizenship, they did 
not intend to exclude those who, in the situation of Tranquilino Roa, were 
citizens of the Philippines by judicial declaration at the time of the adoption 
of the Constitution." "This," the Court went on to say, "is apparent from the 
following excerpt of the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention when 
Article IV of the Constitution was discussed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Delegate Aruego.—Mr. President, may I just have one question? 
May I ask Mr. Roxas if, under this proposition that you have, al children born 
in the Philippines before the adoption of the Constitution was included? </p>
<p align="justify">"Delegate Roxas.—No, sir: that is to say, if they are citizens 
in accordance with the present law, they will be citizens. </p>
<p align="justify">"Delegate Aruego.—But as I have said they are citizens by 
judicial decisions. </p>
<p align="justify">"Delegate Roxas.—If they are citizens now by judicial 
decisions, they will be citizens. </p>
<p align="justify">"Delegate Aruego.—I should like to make it clear that we are 
voting on the proposition so that it will include all those born in the 
Philippines, regardless of their parentage, because I have heard some objections 
here to the incorporation <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> of the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">jus soli</span>. There are many 
who do not want to include, as citizens, children of Chinese parents, but they 
are included in the proposition we are voting upon * * *.</p>
<p align="justify">"I should like to find out from the gentleman from Capiz if 
that proposition would make Filipino citizens of children of Chinese parents 
born last year or this year.</p>
<p align="justify">"Delegate Roxas.—No, because by the laws of the Philippine 
Islands, they are not Filipino citizens now." (Record of the Proceedings of the 
Constitutional Convention, Session of November 26, 1934.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Unlike the Tan Chong case, the herein appellant Uy had attained 
the age of majority when the Constitution went into effect, and had been allowed 
to exercise the right of suffrage, to hold public offices, and to take the oath 
of allegiance to the Commonwealth Government or Republic of the Philipines. </p>
<p align="justify">The Tan Chong decision itself makes this express reservation: 
"Needless to say, this decision is not intended or designed to deprive, as it 
can not divest, of their Filipino citizenship, those who have been declared to 
be Filipino citizens, or upon whom such citizenship had been conferred by the 
courts because of the doctrine or principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">res adjudicata</span>." Certainly, it 
would neither be fair nor good policy to hold the respondent an alien after he 
had exercised the privileges of citizenship and the Government had confirmed his 
Philippine citizenship on the faith of legal principles that had the force of 
law. On several occasions the Secretary of Justice had declared as Filipino 
citizens persons similarly circumstanced as the herein respondent. (Opinion 40, 
series of 1940, of the Secretary of Justice. See also Opinion No. 18, series of 
1942, of the Commissioner of Justice, 1942 Off. Gaz., September.)</p>
<p align="justify">Cut out of the same pattern and deserving of the same 
consideration is the proposition that Alejandro D. Uy became a Philippine 
citizen at least upon his father's death. </p>
<p align="justify">It has been seen that, according to the rule of the Roa case, a 
Filipino woman married to Chinese <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> reacquired her Filipino citizenship 
upon her husband's demise and that thereafter her minor children's nationality 
automatically followed that of the mother's: This rule was not changed by the 
adoption of the <span style="font-style: italic;">jus sanguinis</span> doctrine, and was in force until Commonwealth Act 
No. 63 went into effect in 1936, by which the legislature, for the first time, 
provided a method for regainirg Philippine citizenship by Filipino women in such 
cases. It is to be noted that when Commonwealth Act No. 63 was passed Ursula 
Diabo had been a widow for 39 years and Alejandro D. Uy had been of age three 
years, and that the new law carries no provision giving it retroactive effect. 
</p>
<p align="justify">These conclusions make superfluous consideration of the rest of 
the several assignments of error by the appellant upon which we refrain to 
express on opinion.</p>
<p align="justify">The decision of the lower court is reversed and the respondent 
and appellant declared a Filipino citizen and eligible to the office of 
municipal mayor. The petitioner and appellee will pay the costs of both 
instances.</p>

<p align="justify"></p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCURRENTE</span><br></div><p></p><p align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PABLO, M.: </span><br> </p>
<p align="justify">Opino que Alejandro D. Uy nacio como ciudadano filipino en 28 
de enero de 1912 en Iligan, Lanao, porque su madre Ursula Diabo no estaba casada 
legalmente con Uy Piangco, pues el hijo natural sigue la ciudadania de su madre 
(Serra contra Republica de Filipinas, G. R. No. L-4223, mayo 12, 1952) ; pero al 
casarse ella con Uy Piangco en 3 de marzo de 1914, Alejandro D. Uy quedo 
legitimado por subsiguiente matrimonio (Art. 120, Cod. Civ. Esp.); ipso facto se 
habia hecho ciudadano chino porque como menor de edad, tenia que seguir la 
nacionalidad de su padre legitimo (Art. IS. Cod. Civ. Esp.), como Ursula siguio 
la de su marido (Art. 22, Cod. Civ. Esp.).</p>
<p align="justify">Al fallecimiento de Uy Piangco en 17 de febrero de 1917, Ursula 
Diabo no se hizo automaticamente ciudadana filipina, pues el articulo 22 del 
Codigo Civil Espanol entonces vigente dispone que la espanola (filipina) que 
casare con extranjero podra, disuelto el matrimonio, recobrar la nacionalidad 
espanola (filipina) llenando los requisites expresados en el articulo anterior, 
y estos requisites son: (a) volviendo la viuda al Reino (repatriacion); (b) 
declarando su voluntad de recobrar la ciudadania filipina; y (c) renunciando la 
proteccion del pabellon del pais de su marido. La primera condicion esta 
practicamente cumplida porque Diabo no salio nunca de Filipinas; pero no esta 
probado que hubiese declarado ante el registrador civil de su residencia que era 
su intencion recobrar la ciudadania filipina, ni que hubiese renunciado la 
proteccion de la bandera china. Desde el 26 de noviembre de 1930 en que se 
establecio el registro civil en Filipinas, siendo registrador civil local el 
tesorero municipal, hasta el 28 de agosto de 1949 en que fallecio—mas de 
dieciocho anos—Ursula Diabo tenia amplia oportunidad de hacer la declaracion 
que exige el articulo 21 delCodigo Civil, pero no lo ha hecho; su silencio da 
lugar a la presuncion de que deseo continuar gozando de la ciudadania de su 
marido. Para recobrar la ciudadania filipina, la viuda de un extranjero debe 
ejecutar ciertos actos que demuestren su deseo indubitable de readquirir su 
antigua ciudadania y perder la de su finado marido; por tanto, Alejandro D. Uy 
tampoco readquirio la ciudadania filipina por el mero hecho de haber quedado 
viuda su madre.</p>
<p align="justify">Es principio universalmente aceptado que la expatriation es 
derecho inherente a todos. Los hijos de un extranjero nacidos en Filipinas deben 
manifestar al encargado del Registro Civil dentro del ano siguiente a su mayor 
edad o emancipacion, si desean optar por la ciudadania de su pais natal (Art. 
19, Cod. Civ. Esp.) Aunque no aparece que ha hecho tal manifestacion al 
registrador civil, Alejandro D. Uy ejercito, sin embargo, el derecho de sufragio 
"en las anteriores elecciones verificadas en el pais" al tener edad competente 
para votar. Con ello demostro que queria adoptar la ciudadania del pais de su 
nacimiento, prefiriendola a la de su padre. Cuando en 1935 Alejandro D. Uy 
sirvio al gobierno como maestro de escuela bajo el Departamento de Instruccion 
Publica, despues escribiente en la tesoreria municipal de Initao en 1937, y mas 
tarde tesorero de Lugait en 1942 a 1943, y cuando, conexposicion de su vida, 
ingreso en las filas del 120.°. Regimiento de Infanteria de las guerrillas, 
demostro de una manera clara e inequivoca que preferia ser ciudadano filipino a 
ser ciudadano chino. </p>
<p align="justify">Alejandro D. Uy, de acuerdo con el Codigo Civil antiguo, es 
ciudadano filipino porque opto serlo al Ilegar a mayor edad. Tambien es 
ciudadano filipino por disposicion constitucional. Al votar en las elecciones 
verificadas en el pais al Ilegar a la mayor edad, demostro que quiso abrazar la 
ciudadania filipina. La Constitution dice asi: "Son ciudadanos filipinos: * * * 
(4) los que, siendo hijos de madres de ciudadania filipina, optaren por esta al 
Ilegar a la mayor edad." (Art. 4, Titulo IV, Constitucion). Bueno es hacer 
constar que existe error en esta disposicion: debe decirse "madres de 
nacionalidad filipina" y no "madres de ciudadania filipina." La filipina que se 
casa con un extranjero sigue la ciudadania de su marido; por el simple hecho del 
matrimonio pierde la ciudadania filipina y se hace extranjera: no puede 
continuar en ta condicion de ciudadana filipina por expresa disposicion de la 
ley, pero no pierde la naeionalidad filipina.</p>
<p align="justify">Por las razones expuestas, y no por otras, Alejandro D. Uy 
adquirio la ciudadania filipina. </p><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCURRING</span><br></div><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PADILLA, J.:</span><br> 
<p align="justify">I would rest the judgment in this case on the undisputed fact 
that the respondent was born out of wedlock in Iligan, Lanao, on 28 January 1912 
of a Filipino mother and a Chinese father who were married on 3 March 1914 and 
that his father died on 17 February 1917. He was a Filipino citizen, became 
Chinese citizen when his father and mother were married, and reacquired his 
original citizenship on the death of his father, because being under age he 
followed the citizenship of his mother who reacquired her Filipino citizenship 
upon the death of her husband and never remarried.</p>
<p align="justify">I do not agree to the proposition that persons born in this 
country of alien parentage or whose father is an alien must be deemed Filipino 
citizens under and by virtue of the doctrine laid down in the case of Roa vs. 
Collector of Customs, 23 Phil., 315. Precisely, the judgment in the cases of Tan 
Chong vs. The Secretary of Labor and Lam Swee Sang vs. The Commonwealth of the 
Philippines, 45 Off. Gaz., 1269, holds that as the doctrine laid down in the 
case of Roa vs. Collector of Customs, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, is in conflict with the law in 
force at the time it must be abandoned. Jose Tan Chong invoked also the benefit 
of the doctrine in the Roa vs. Collector of Customs case. There is only an 
exception to the rule laid down in the cases of Tan Chong vs. The Secretary of 
Labor and Lam Swee Sang vs. The Commonwealth of the Philippines, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrador, J.</span>, concurs.</div>
