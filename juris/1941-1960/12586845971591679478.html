				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These expropriation proceedings initiated in the Court of First Instance of 
Batangas by the Bureau of Lands in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, 
involve seven lots formerly a part of the Hacienda LIAN or LIAN ESTATE in the 
municipality of Lian, Batangas, which estate formerly belonged in its entirety 
to the Colegio de San Jose Inc., a Jesuit corporation, under Original 
Certificate of Title No. 15521. It seems that the Hacienda or rather the income 
therefrom was used for the support and education of young Filipinos studying for 
the priesthood. The Hacienda originally had an extension of several thousand 
hectares and was occupied and cultivated by lessees and by tenants (inquilinos). 
About the year 1931 the religious authorities decided to break up this big 
estate as far as possible into small lots averaging one hundred hectares each 
and sell it to <em>bona fide</em> lessees, the price to be payable on the 
installment plan.
<p>One of these lessees was Nelson V. Sinclair. He had occupied under a contract 
of lease a portion of this estate since 1928, cultivating a portion by means of 
tractors and the remainder by means of <em>aparceros</em> under yearly contracts 
such as Exhibits 4, 4-A, 4-B (Baylosis).</p>
<p>In 1937 he bought from the Lian Estate the portion leased to him with an 
approximate area of 87 hectares. Subsequently, this portion was subdivided into 
seven lots, to wit: 306-YYYY, 306-BBBB, 306-CCCC, 306-DDDD, 306-EEEE, 306-Z and 
306-LL. In 1947 Sinclair sold lot 306-YYYY with an area of about 25 hectares and 
306- BBBB with an area of about 17 hectares to Cirilo P. Baylosis for P40,000 
and P28,000, respectively, although the corresponding transfer certificates of 
title were not issued until 1948 and 1949, respectively. After the purchase, 
Cirilo P. Baylosis subdivided the two lots into small parcels and sold the same 
to his co-defendants in this case, except Sinclair and Luis Baylosis. In 1950 
Sinclair sold to Cirilio P. Baylosis lot 306-CCCC with an area of about 13 
hectares and lot 306-DDDD with an area of about 10 hectares for P39,000. (See 
Exhibit 16-Baylosis) </p>
<p>About October 7, 1946, some 68 persons claiming to be tenants and occupants 
of the parcels originally owned by Sinclair addressed a petition in Tagalog to 
the Rural Progress Administration, a rough translation in English of which 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We, the undersigned, are all workers in this land for a long time, and were 
the ones who cleared the place of its big trees.</p>
<p>That is why we are requesting the Government to buy the land and we shall pay 
the instalment to the Government."</p></blockquote>
<p>Much later, on the basis of the petition, the Rural Progress Administration 
through its Manager Faustino Aguilar, on May 4, 1948, addressed a letter to 
Sinclair reading as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right"><em>"May 4, 1948</em></p>
<p>Mr. N. V. Sinclair<br>181 David, Escolta<br>Manila</p>
<p><em>Sir</em>:</p>
<p>There has been received in this Office a petition for the acquisition by the 
Government for resale to the tenants of the following six lots in Binubusan, 
owned and/or administered by you:</p>
<p><em>Lot N. 306—CCCC under tax declaration No. 
852</em><br><em>Area</em>—13.9125 hectares.<br><em>Kind</em>—Irrigated 
agricultural land.<br><em>Assessed value</em>—P6,400.00</p>
<p><em>Lot No. 306—Z under tax declaration No. 858</em><br><em>Area</em>—8.7762 
hectares.<br><em>Kind</em>—7.7762 hectares irrigated agricultural land 1.0000 
hectare<br>—riceland.<br><em>Assessed value</em>—P4,040.</p>
<p><em>Lot No. 306—YYY under tax declaration No. 
864</em><br><em>Area</em>—25.0159 hectares.<br><em>Kind</em>—Irrigated 
agricultural land.<br><em>Assessed value</em>—P9,760. : </p>
<p><em>Lot No. 306—BBBB under taof declaration No. 
365</em><br><em>Area</em>—17.9827 hectares.<br><em>Kind</em>—Irrigated 
agricultural land.<br><em>Assessed value</em>—P7,010</p>
<p><em>Lot No. 306—EEEE under tax declaration No. 
866</em><br><em>Area</em>—10.4955.<br><em>Kind</em>—Irrigated agricultural 
land.<br><em>Assessed value</em>—P4,090.</p>
<p><em>Lot No. 306—LL under tax declaration No. 350</em><br><em>Owner</em>— 
Colegio de San Jose.<br><em>Administrator</em>—N. V. 
Sinclair.<br><em>Area</em>—14.3208 hectares.<br><em>Kind</em>—Fish 
pond.<br><em>Assessed value</em>—P5,730.</p>
<p>The reason given by the tenants in presenting their petition is that your 
relation with them is not altogether too satisfactory having on previous 
occasion tried to disregard the 70-30 crop sharing basis, although later have 
yielded to observance thereof upon the insistence of the tenants. They likewise 
complain that you are planning to eject them, a plan which if carried out, will 
result in untold sufferings on their part, without mentioning the pain of 
leaving the premises which they have occupied and tilled since time 
immemorial.</p>
<p>Before we take action on their petition we will appreciate your favor of 
informing us for your willingness to sell said parcels of land, in accordance 
with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 539 and the conditions of the 
sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><em>Respectfully,</em></p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) Faustino Aguilar<br><em>Manager</em>"</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 7th, Sinclair wrote the following answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"<em>May 7, 1948</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rural Progress Administration<br>Department of Justice Building<br>Walled 
City, Manila</p>
<p>Attention: Mr. Faustino Aguilar, Manager</p>
<p><em>Gentleman</em>:</p>
<p>This will acknowledge receipt today of your communication dated May 4th, with 
reference to the petition for your Administration to purchase lands of the 
writer located in barrio Binubusan, munic- ipality of Lian, Province of 
Batangas.</p>
<p>The reasons given by the petitioners are not true and it will be a pleasure 
to acquaint you with the facts concerned with each of the lots specified.</p>
<p>This information will be assembled at the earliest possible time and in order 
to expedite its submission to your goodselves, your letter is being forwarded to 
my representative at Lian.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it is requested that you kindly allow me sufficient time to 
submit the true facts pertaining to each lot before you take action on this 
Petition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right"><em>Respectfully</em>,</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) N. V. Sinclair<br>Owner</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On November 15, 1958, Manager Aguilar again wrote to Sinclair as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"<em>November 15, 1948</em></p>
<p>Mr. N. V. Sinclair<br>181 David Escolta<br>Manila</p>
<p><em>Sir</em>:<br></p>
<p>In connection with your letter dated May 7, 1948, advising us that you will 
forward to this Office under separate cover information regarding your refusal 
to sell to certain petitioners your lands in Binubusan, Lian, Batangas, known as 
lot Nos. 306-CCCC; 306-Z; 306-YYY; 306-BBBB; 306-EEE and 306-LL, please be 
informed that up to the present we have not as yet received said letter. As it 
is our desire to apprise the petitioners of the same, the favor of fin early 
information from you will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Likewise the petitioners again called at this Office and have made an offer 
to buy said lands at P600 per hectare on a 10-year period to pay. If the said 
price iflf acceptable to you, please advise us accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="right">Respectfully,</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) Faustino Aguilar<br>Manager"</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thereafter, having been informed that Sinclair had sold his parcels or seme 
of them to one Cirilo P. B.aylosis, Manager Aguilar on January 17, 1949, wrote 
the following letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">"<em>January 17, 1949</em></p>
<p>Atty. Cirilo P. Baylosis<br>Balayan, Batangas</p>
<p><em>Sir</em>:</p>
<p>We have been informed that you bought the lands of N. V. Sinclair at 
Binubusan, Lian, Batangas, known as lots 306-YYY; 306- LL; 306-Z; 306-CCCC; 
306-BBBB and 306-EEEE and that you are at present taking all the crops thereon 
including the share due to the tenants with the help of constabulary soldiers. 
If the report is true, we request that you refrain from taking such step in 
order to avoid any untoward incident that may arise therefrom.</p>
<p>The lands which you bought are the stibject of a petition for acquisition and 
resale to the tenants thereof which is pending final action by this Office.</p>
<p align="right"><em>Respectfully,</em></p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) Faustino Aguilar<br>Manager"</p></blockquote>
<p>Thereafter, on February 6, 1951, the Republic of the Philippines filed the 
original complaint for expropriation against Cirilo P. Baylosis and Sinclair, 
which complaint was twice amended, the second amended complaint being filed on 
April 16, 1952, so as to include all the persons to whom Sinclair and Cirilo P. 
Baylosis had sold portions of the lots sought to be expropriated.</p>
<p>On February 14, 1951, the Court of First Instance of Batangas after hearing 
the parties issued an order placing the plaintiffs in possession of the property 
sought to be expropriated after plaintiff had made a deposit of P27,105.22. On 
February 24, 1951, the tenants and occupants in whose behalf the expropriation 
proceedings were instituted moved to intervene, accompanying their motion with a 
complaint in intervention. Believing that their interests were sufficiently 
taken care of and defended by the plaintiff, the trial court deemed said 
intervention unnecessary. The defendants numbering about 21 filed 9 separate 
motions to dismiss based on several grounds, among which are: that the 
expropriation was being made not for public use; that the defendants would be 
deprived of their property without due process of law; that the plaintiff has no 
right under the guise of expropriation to take the property of a private citizen 
and deliver the same to another private individual; that the Constitution 
authorizes the expropriation of big landed estates but not of small areas like 
these owned by the defendants; that the present expropriation was intended to 
benefit only about 44 persons who do not represent the public and that many of 
said persons already have lands of their own; that tHe various defendants 
individually own only small portion of the property under expropriation; that 
the second amended complaint is defective in that it did not describe the 
specific property sought to be expropriated; and that the current price of 
irrigated lands in Batangas is about P3,000 per hectare and so plaintiff's 
deposit was insufficient.</p>
<p>After hearing and the introduction of evidence, both oral and documentary, 
the trial court issued an order dated July 18, 1952, dismissing the various 
motions for dismissal and declaring the plaintiff entitled to take the property 
sought to be condemned for public use as described in the second amended 
complaint upon payment of just compensation to be ascertained by Commissioners 
to be appointed by the court for this purpose. The defendants are now appealing 
from that order directly to this Tribunal.</p>
<p>The trial court declared that the present expropriation proceedings are based 
on Section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution which provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Congress may authorized upon payment of just compensation, the 
expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost 
to individuals."</p></blockquote>
<p>and section 1 of Commonwealth Act 539 which provides that the President of 
the Philippines is authorized to acquire private lands through purchase or 
expropriation and subdivide the same into home lots or small farms for resale to 
bona fide tenants or occupants. The trial court also said that although this 
Tribunal in the case of Guido <em>vs</em>. Rural Progress Administration, G. R. 
No. L-2089 (47 Off. Gaz.,No. 4 p. 1848) held that section 4 of Article XIII of 
the Constitution had reference to large estates, still, the total area of the 
parcels now sought to be expropriated, whicn, is between 67 arid 77 hectares, 
may hot be considered small; that the tenants and occupants of the land for whom 
these expropriatioh proceedings were instituted have by themselves and their 
ancestors been occupying, clearing and cultivating the land for many years and 
that they are entitled now to purchase the same; that the situation in the area 
in question was far from peaceful because there was misunderstanding and trouble 
between tenants on one side, and their landlords (the defendants herein) on the 
other, regarding their shares in the harvests and that the only way to solve 
this tenancy problem was to expropriate the land and sell it to the tenants; 
that both Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis were formerly agreeable to sell this 
land to others for a profit as shown by the fact that they had actually sold 
portions thereof to others and that consequently, they can now have no valid 
objection to the expropriation, that heretofore the Government had already 
expropriated a large portion of Lian Estate or Hacienda, divided the same into 
small lots and thereafter resold them to tenants, thereby showing that by its 
nature, location and destination, the property is suitable for the purpose for 
which it is being expropriated, and that these proceedings are in keeping with 
what the Government had alreay done with respect to other portions; that 
although it is contended that several of the tenants and occupants have already 
lands of their own aside from the portions they are now occupying, still, they 
are actual occupants and it would noi be fair or just that they would not be 
included in the benefits of the expropriation, and that in any event, once the 
expropriation is carried out, it is for the Government to screen and process the 
tenants, and that those found already owning lands may be disqualified to buy 
the land being expropriated. As to the portions into which lots 306-YYYY and 
306-BB have been sub-divided and then sold by Cirilo P. Baylosis to his 
co-defendants, the trial court observed that said sales were made after Baylosis 
had been served on January 17, 1949, with notice by the Rural Progress 
Administration of the intention of the Government to purchase said lots, and 
that considering that the purchasers are relatives of Baylosis, and that the 
transfer certificates of title were issued in 1950, there was reason to believe 
that these sales by Baylosis were simulated, and intended to frustrate the 
attempt of the Government to expropriate.</p>
<p>For a better and a clearer understanding of the facts in this case, 
particularly the parcels involved, their areas and owners, the particular 
portions sought to be expropriated and the number of tenants and occupants 
sought to be benefitted by the expropriation, we have prepared the following 
tables or graphs, marked "A" and "G," based on the pleadings and on the order 
appealed from.</p>

<p>Table "A" shaws the number of lots to be affected by the expropriation 
including the areas to be expropriated, and the number of their occupants and 
dependents. Table "B" shows the names of the owners of the original seven lots 
involved and of the smaller lots into which they had been subdivided and their 
areas. Table "A" further shows the area sought to be expropriated from each 
individual lot, totaling approximately 67 hectares. The number of tenants or 
occupants is about 44 and the number of their dependents is about 214. For the 
defendants owners, there are about 23 of them with about 90 dependents.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the tables that neither the exact location of the 
portion to be expropriated from each lot nor its form or shape is stated or 
defined, thereby supporting the contention of the defendants on this point. 
Table "A" also shows that the Government wants to expropriate, not one whole 
parcel or the seven lots comprising said parcel but is selecting only portions 
of said seven different and separate lots, presumably those actually occupied 
and cultivated by the tenants. If the expropriation is carried out, we do not 
know what portions would be left to the owners, the forms therof and whether or 
not it would be worthwhile for the said owners to keep them.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the several reasons given by the trial court for upholding 
the right of the Government to expropriate in this case. It says that the 
tenants and occupants for whose benefit the land is being expropriated have by 
themselves and their ancestors been occupying and cultivating the same for many 
years and are therefore entitled to purchase the same. We. are afraid that that 
holding has no legal basis. The mere fact that d person as a tenant has occupied 
and cultivated and even cleared the land for his landlord does not entitle him 
to purchase the same against his landlord's will, by means of expropriation. 
Expropriation by the Government, obliging a land owner to part with his real 
estate is authorised only when done for public use or for public benefit and not 
to enable one to own real property at the expense of another especially when 
said owner has no other real property except the one being expropriated. Some of 
the defendants herein (Alejandro Abellera and Benito Baylosis) have no other 
land except the small lots bought by them from Cirilo P. Baylosis and now 
subject of the present expropriation proceedings. Defendant Juan Gonzales told 
the Court that he is actually by himself, plowing and cultivating the small lot 
of about one hectare that he bought from Cirilo P. Baylosis, now sought to be 
condemned. We should not forget that the Constitution protects private property, 
prohibits a citizen being deprived of his property without due process of law, 
and that even in condemnation proceedings when said citizen is given just 
compensation for his property expropriated, still, the expropriation to be valid 
must be for a public use or public benefit.</p>
<p>Again, the trial court says that there are tenancy problems in the lands 
being expropriated, there being misunderstanding between the owners and the 
tenants as to the share of each in the harvest, and that the only way this 
problem could be solved is to expropriate the land. This seems to be a novel 
theory which finds no statutory or constitutional support. If this theory were 
correct and is to be followed and applied, then all that a tenant has to do in 
order to be able to buy the land of his landlord is for him, or better still, 
with the help and cooperation of his co-tenants, to violate the tenancy law, 
refuse to give the 30% corresponding to his or their landlord or even deny the 
title of said landlord, thereby creating a tenancy problem, upon which the 
Government will immediately step in and commence expropriation proceedings, 
claiming that the only solution of the trouble between the landlord and the 
tenants lies in expropriation. We cannot believe Jhat was ever the intention of 
either tfie framers of the Constitution or of the members of Congress. That is 
the reason why Congress has promulgated the Tenancy Law, clearly specifying the 
rights and obligations of both landlord and tenant, their respective shares in 
the harvest, and the removal of a tenant only for certain specified reasons or 
causes; and that is why we have the Tenancy Division in the Court of Industrial 
Relations to handle and decide tenancy disputes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not exactly correct to say that there is a tenancy problem 
in the land in question, and even if there were, the fault may be attributed to 
the tenants themselves rather than to the owners. It will be remembered that in 
the petition filed by about 68 persons claiming to be occupants of the parcels 
originally owned by Sinclair dated October 6, 1946, addressed to the Rural 
Progress Administration, nothing was said about tenancy trouble. All that they 
said in said petition was that they had been working on the land for a long time 
and had cleared the place of big trees, and that they wanted to buy the land and 
pay the price to the Government in installment. Indeed, the evidence shows that 
Sinclair never had any trouble with his tenants. And there is reason to believe 
and evidence to support the belief that the tenancy trouble on the land in 
question began only around the year 1948 after the tenants and occupants were 
presumably given the hope and the assurance by the Rural Progress Administration 
that the Government was going to acquire the land for them either through 
purchase or expropriation. It was then according to Cirilo P. Baylosis that the 
tenants refused to give him and his co-defendants their share of the harvest and 
even refused to acknowledge him as owner of the land he had bought from 
Sinclair. So, according to Cirilo P. Baylosis, he and his co-defendants to whom 
he had resold portions of the land bought from Sinclair, had to go to the 
Tenancy Law Enforcement Office and complain against the tenants and said Tenancy 
Office in several orders concurred in by the Court of Industrial Relations held 
that even under Commonwealth Act 538 which authorizes the suspension of cases of 
ejectment against tenants of lands included in condemnation proceedings, the 
tenants should first pay the current rents or give the shares of the landlords 
in the harvest, a thing which the tenants in those cases had failed and refused 
to do and so the cases against the tenants were decided against them. (See 
Exhibits V-1-1, V-2-1, V-3-1 and V-4-1)</p>
<p>The trial court also said that if Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis formerly 
were willing to sell their holdings or portions thereof to others as they have 
done to their co-defendants, there was no reason why the defendants should now 
object to the Government purchasing said lands through expropriation. But there 
is a difference and room for distinction. The right to dispose or not to dispose 
of one's property is one of the attributes of ownership. A person just because 
he is willing to sell his property to "A" may not be obliged to sell it to "B" 
unless the law in certain specific cases such as legal redemption compels him to 
do so. Again, a land owner may be willing or even offer to sell his land today 
to "A", but unless the offer is accepted and acted upon, he may change his mind 
and refuse to sell to "A" next year or refuse to sell it to anyone for that 
matter.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that both Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis at one time were 
willing to sell to some of the tenants and occupants herein involved under 
certain conditions and provided that they buy in groups, presumably to avoid 
subdivisions and the problem of dealing with many individual buyers, but the 
tenants failed to buy. Naturally, they may not now compel Sinclair and Cirilo P. 
Baylosis to sell to them through the Government by means of expropriation. 
Besides, the bulk of the lands that Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis had formerly 
offered to them for sale which offer they failed to take advantage of, has now 
been sold to others, the other co-defendants herein, in small lots.</p>
<p>One reason not improbable why the tenants and occupants failed to take 
advantage of the former offer of Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis to sell the 
lands to them was the matter of price. According to the letter of the Rural 
Progress Administration to Sinclair on November 15, 1948, those who signed the 
petition of October 17, 1946, claiming to be the tenants and occupants of the 
land, offered to buy the same at P600 per hectare, payable within a period of 
ten years. The defendant owners of the land herein claim that the current price 
of first class riceland in Batangas is around P3,000 per hectare. Even taking as 
a basis the price paid by Cirilo P. Baylosis for the lots bought by him from 
Sinclair, now being expropriated, the price is way over P1,000 almost P2.000 per 
hectare. Naturally, Sinclair and Baylosis were unwilling to sell at P600 a 
hectare, to say nothing of said price being paid in ten years. And that is the 
reason why the defendants herein claim that the deposit of P27,000 made by the 
tenants and occupants, is insufficient to cover the price of the land, said 
amount of the deposit being equivalent to only about P400 per hectare for the 67 
hectares sought to be expropriated.</p>
<p>Supposing that the expropriation is carried out and the Commissioners and the 
trial court find that the land expropriated is worth P2,000 or more per hectare, 
would the tenants and occupants be still willing and would they be able to pay 
said price? Supposing that they were not, then what would happen? Would the 
Government undertake to pay the difference between the actual value of the land 
expropriated for them and their offer to pay only P600 per hectare, and this 
payable in ten years at that? Section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution on 
which tiie present expropriation proceedings are supposed to be based says that 
the lands expropriated are to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed <em>at 
cost</em> to individuals. That means that the Government will not make any 
profit in the transaction, but it also conveys the idea that the Government will 
sell at a price to include what it cost the Government to expropriate. The cost 
of subdivision, registration fees and transfer certificates of title will 
probably have to be added to the cost of the land. Again, it may be asked, what 
will the Government do if the tenants and occupants are neither willing nor able 
to pay said total cost?</p>
<p>There is another point that merits consideration. The defendants claim and 
correctly that many of the tenants and occupants now insisting on expropriation 
have lands of their own. According to the list prepared by the Bureau of Lands 
containing the names of persons who are occupying and holding portions of land 
being administered by the Bureau of Lands in Batangas (ExhilHt 13-Baylosis), 
many, if not the majority of the tenants and occupants of the lands now sought 
to be expropriated are included in said list The evidence further shows that 
several of the tenants, among them Victor Magpantay, C. Balaquiot, Luciano 
Panganiban, Isabelo Manguera and Andres Castronuevo have lands of their own; 
that some of the lands are sugar lands for which they hold sugar quotas and one 
of the said tenants, Andres Castronuevo, is cultivating a portion of the land 
sought to be expropriated and which he wants to buy, not by himself but through 
an <em>aparcero</em> or tenant.</p>
<p>In relation to this claim of the defendants that some of the tenants and 
occupants have lands of their own and so are not qualified to be the 
beneficiaries of expropriation, the trial court said that that is no problem 
because the Government can later screen and process said, tenants and occupants, 
and that if some are found to be disqualified because they are already land 
owners, then they should not be allowed to purchase the portions occupied by 
them. But if and when this happens, what becomes of said portions taken away 
from their former owners over their vigorous opposition and which portions later 
proved to be not subject to expropriation for the reason that the persons 
occupying them do not deserve and are not qualified to purchase them? A real 
injustice will have been done to the owners of these portions because they had 
been included and made defendants in these proceedings, deprived of their 
holdings against their will, only to find out later that the expropriation as to 
these portions was improper and unjustified.</p>
<p>The defendants have introduced evidence without refutation through the 
testimony of one Anacleto Jonson, an employee of the Bureau of Lands in charge 
of the 3,700 hectares of the Lian Estate expropriated by the Government way back 
in 1940 and 1941, and intended to be subdivided into small lots and resold to 
their tenants and occupants, on the status of said lands. According to Jonson, 
since then which up to now, involves a period of about thirteen years, said area 
of 3,700 hectares remains unsubdivided; that no portion of said big area has 
been resold or even contracted to be resold by the Government to their occupants 
and tenants, and all that the Government is doing is to administer the same and 
receive the portion of the yearly harvest corresponding to the owner. In other 
words, all that has been done, thirteen years after the expropriation was to 
transfer the ownership and administration of this big area with about 800 
tenants and families from the lian Estate to the Government which has assumed 
the role of lessor and landlord. No reason or explanation was given for this 
rather strange if not anomalous situation. The defendants, owners of the land 
being condemned, feeling a little bitter against the Government, condemns its 
action in instituting the present proceedings, and point to this unfortunate 
situation and status of the 3,700 hectares expropriated in 1941 as an example of 
the Government's rather over-ambitious program of expropriation. They say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * *. In 1939, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, filed the expropriation 
proceedings in the Court of First Instance of Batangas of certain portions of 
the Lian Estate still owned by Colegio de San Jose, Inc., and occupied by 800 
persons (t.s.n. p. 359). The Colegio de San Jose, Inc., finally executed the 
Deed of Sale for 4,300 hectares of land on May 1940, and title and ownership to 
these lands were then transferred to the Commonwealth of the Philippines 
(t.s.n., pp. 73-74, 357-359). However, notwithstanding, the expropriation of 
this Urge estate of 4,300 hectares of homesites and agricultural lands by the 
Commonwealth of the Philippines 13 years ago, for resale to the poor and 
landless, up to the present time this property has not been subdivided into 
small lots, nor sold to the actual occupants (t. s. n., p. 360). Notwithstanding 
this state of affairs, the plaintiff is still bent on expropriating another 67 
hectares of agricultural lands consisting of 18 small lots of small areas which 
do not adjoin each other and belonging to 20 small landowners (Record on Appeal, 
pp. 2-14) who are intended by the framers of the Constitution to be protected by 
section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution." (<em>Appellant's brief, pp. 
7-8</em>).</p></blockquote>
<p>This Tribunal in the case of Guido <em>vs</em>. Rural Progress 
Administration, <em>supra</em>, held that Section 4 Article XIII of the 
Constitution has reference only to large estates, trusts in perpetuity, and 
lands that embrace a whole town or a large portion of a. town or city. The lands 
now sought to be expropriated with a total area of 67 hectares, even if 
considered as one whole parcel which they are not, can of course not be regarded 
as a landed estate. During the discussion of this case it was urged by the 
minority that as long as any land formerly formed part of a landed or large 
estate, it may, regardless of its present area be still subject to expropriation 
under section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution, citing the doctrine laid down 
in the case of Rural Progress Administration vs. Reyes, G. R. No. L-4703, 
October 8, 1953. It is true that said ruling was made in the Reyes case but we 
should bear in mind that that was a decision by a highly divided court, six for 
the majority and four dissenting, but two majority concurring only in the result 
and one of them concurring in a separate opinion. It seems that the members of 
the Tribunal espousing the majority opinion therein were greatly impressed by 
the fact that notwithstanding the small area involved, about two hectares, there 
were 113 persons living on the same, and dependent on the products of the 
fisheries on it, and evidently had no other place to go to live. We feel that 
the decision in that Reyes case was a departure from the doctrine laid down in 
the leading case of Guido which doctrine has been subsequently affirmed and 
reiterated in a long line of cases, and we now believe that in abandoning the 
ruling made in the Reyes case, this Tribunal is merely returning to and 
re-affirming the sound and wholesome doctrine laid down in the Guido Case.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the constitutional provision contained in section 4, 
Article XIII of that instrument was to break up landed estates into reasonably 
small portions. Once said landed estate is broken up, the purpose of the 
constitution is achieved. Otherwise, were we to adhere to1 the rule made in the 
Reyes case that if a piece of land, regardless of size, formerly formed part of 
a big landed estate, it is necessarily subject to expropriation, then there 
would be no limit or foreseeable end to expropriation. A landed estate of say 
3,000 hectares is broken up into say 50-hectare lots and sold to the lessees or 
occupants thereof. The tenants in that 50-hectare lot want to buy their holdings 
and because the lot was formerly a part of a landed estate, it is again 
expropriated and subdivided into say 5-hectare lots. A buyer o£ this 5- hectare 
portion may have tenants cultivating portions thereof and these tenants would 
again insist on expropriation into say one hectare lots and so this 
expropriation would and may go on endlessly until the minimum of a few square 
meters is reached, just to accommodate one single tenant. We hold that that 
could not have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution. We also 
say that once a landed estate is broken up into portions of reasonable area, the 
buyers thereof are protected by the Constitution against further 
expropriation.</p>
<p>The trial court in justifying the present expropriation held that the land 
sought to be condemned with an area between 67 and 77 hectares is not small. It 
perhaps meant to say that it is large, and so may be regarded as a landed estate 
coming within the contemplation of the Constitution for purposes of 
expropriation. As a matter of fact, the land is only about 67 hectares in area. 
Not only this but it has already been subdivided into smaller portions ranging 
from thirteen hectares to as small as one hectare and now owned by different 
individual families. But even considering the land as a whole parcel of 67 
hectares, may it be considered a landed estate whose ownership by one person is 
discouraged by the Constitution, and so subject to expropriation?</p>
<p>Our attention is called by the defendants-appellants to Land Administrative 
Order No. R-3 issued by the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources. 
Executive Order No. 376 dated November 28, 1950, abolished the Rural Progress 
Administration which was formerly in charge of the expropriation of landed 
estates and transferred said function to the Bureau of Lands, creating therein a 
Division of Landed Estates. The Bureau of Lands is under the Department of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources and the latter promulgated Administrative 
Order No. R-3 under the provisions of Section 79-B of the Revised Administrative 
Code. This Administrative Order is entitled "Rules and Regulations Governing the 
Acquisition and Diposition of Landed Estates. Section 3 thereof reads as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"3. <em>Minimum Area of Private Estates to be acquired</em>.—Except in 
special cases, no proceedings shall be initiated for the appropriation of an 
estate unless the area thereof be at least 5 hectares if for residential 
purpose; and at least 100 hectares if for agricultural purposes. This shall be 
without prejudice to the acquisition of smaller areas thru 
negotiation."</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the above reproduced section, no agricultural land will be 
expropriated for purposes of resale if less than 100 hectares in area. Although 
this Administrative Order was issued on October 19, 1951, after the commencement 
of the present expropriation proceedings, nevertheless it embodies the policy of 
the Government as to the size of agricultural lands that may be expropriated 
under section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution. In other words, the 
Government considers 100 hectares of agricultural land not to be too large to be 
owned by an individual, family, or entity so as to be subject to expropriation 
And this policy is but just and is consistent and in keeping with the policy 
contained in our laws governing the public domain. Under the old Public Land Law 
(Act No. 926), a person and his family may apply for and obtain a homestead with 
an area of 16 hectares. This was evidently found to be too small for purposes of 
expansion for a family and the area for a homestead was later increased to 24 
hectares under Act 2874 and Commonwealth Act 141. That means that a man, poor 
and landless, who has to apply to the Government for a homestead may own as much 
as 24 hectares of land. Commonwealth Act 141 provides that an individual may 
purchase 144 hectares of public land, meaning to say, that 144 hectares is not 
too large a parcel to be owned by a person or a family. And as to corporations 
the Public Land Act authorizes them to purchase or lease 1024 hectares of the 
public domain. In view of this policy of the Government as to the size of 
agricultural land which a corporation or an individual may legitimately own, 
even purchase from the Government itself, it is clear that a parcel of 67 
hectares in area such as the land now sought to be expropriated is not a landed 
estate or too large a parcel so as to justify expropriation; and if we consider 
the fact that these 67 hectares were originally seven distinct and separate 
parcels owned by Sinclair and later subdivided into about 17 parcels now owned 
by twenty-three, one would realize the impropriety of expropriating so as to 
enable the tenants and occupants thereof to buy them In the Guido case we 
indirectly held through Mr. Justice Tuason that parcels of 10, 15 or 25 hectares 
in area may not be expropriated for the purpose of reselling them to the tenants 
and occupants, and that to do so would be an act of oppression. What the 
Government is now trying to do in the present case is to take away parcels 
ranging from one to thirteen hectares in area from about 23 land owners with 
about 90 dependents and transfer them to about forty-four tenants with about 214 
dependents. We hold that that cannot be done, not only because it has no 
statutory or constitutional support but also because it is unjust. What section 
4, Article XIII of the Constitution intended and sought to do was merely to 
break up landed estates, and trusts in perpetuity. It intended to discourage the 
concentration of and excessive landed wealth in an entity or a few individuals, 
but surely it did not intend or seek to distribute wealth among citizens or take 
away from a citizen land which he did not actually need and give it to another 
who needs it. That does not come within the realm of social justice. Said this 
Tribunal in the Guido case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The promotion of social justice ordained by the Constitution does not supply 
paramount basis for untraxnmeled expropriation of private land by the Rural 
Progress Administration or any other government instrumentality. Social justice 
does not champion division of property or equality of economic status; what it 
and the Constitution do guaranty are equality of opportunity, equality of 
political rights, equality before the law, equality between values given and 
received, and equitable sharing of the social and material goods on the basis of 
efforts in their production."</p></blockquote>
<p>The trial court held that Cirilo P. Baylosis subdivided lots 306-YYY and 
306-BB and sold them to many of his co-defendants in the year 1950, as shown by 
the dates of the registration of the sales in the Office of the Register of 
Deeds, this, after he had been notified by the Rural Progress Administration in 
1949 of the intention of the Government to expropriate those lots, and that 
furthermore, many if not all of the purchasers of his lots as subdivided were 
his relatives, thereby giving said court reason to believe that those sales by 
Cirilo were all simulated, intended to frustrate the attempt of the Government 
to expropriate. In the first place, Cirilo asserts I that he made the 
subdivision and made the sales before he received the notice from the Rural 
Progress Administration in 1949 but because it took the Bureau of Lands a long 
time to approve the subdivision survey and plan, the sales were not registered 
until 1950. In the second place, the mere fact that a land owner subdivides his 
land and sells them to his relatives does not mean that the sales are simulated 
or fraudulent. It is not unnatural for a person who has something to sell, to 
give preference to his relatives; and with respect to lands, to have as his 
neighbors and adjoining owners people whom he knows and are related to him. In 
the third place, and this is the most important, even assuming that Cirilo P. 
Baylosis was previously notified of the intention of the Government to 
expropriate his land, said notice by no means could legally prevent him from 
disposing of his property; otherwise, the mere announcement or notice of the 
intention of the Government to expropriate a parcel of land, however indefinite 
and uncertain that intention may be, would as it were freeze said property in 
the hands of its owner. Thereafter, the owner may not deal with his own 
property, mortgage it, much less sell it and all he could do is to wait 
patiently, for any future action of the Government in the way of expropriation. 
Said expropriation may come long afterwards or may not come at all because the 
Government may change its mind, and in the meantime the landowner is rendered 
helpless as regards his own property. In the present case, as already stated, 
the petition for expropriation was not filed by the Government until the year 
1951, more than two years after the notice of the Government's intention to 
expropriate was served on Cirilo. We hold that mere notice of the intention of 
the Government to expropriate lands in the future does not and cannot bind the 
landowner and prevent him from dealing with his property. To bind the land to be 
expropriated and the owner thereof, the expropriation must be commenced in court 
and even then we are not certain that the owner may not deal with his property 
thereafter, mortgage or even sell it if he can find persons who would step into 
his shoes and deal with the Government, either resist the expropriation if in 
their opinion it is illegal or accept the expropriation and remain with what is 
left of the property if the entire property is not needed by the Government.</p>
<p>In conclusion we hold that under section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution, 
the Government may expropriate only landed estates with extensive areas, 
specially those embracing the whole or a large part of a town or city; that once 
a landed estate is broken up and divided into parcels of reasonable areas, 
either thru voluntary sales by the owner or owners of said landed estate, or 
thru expropriation, the resulting parcels are-no longer subject to further 
expropriation under section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution; that mere 
notice of the intention of the Government to expropriate a parcel of land does 
not bind either the land or the owner so as to prevent subsequent disposition of 
the property such as mortgaging or even selling it in whole or by subdivision; 
that tenancy trouble alone whether due to the fault of the tenants or of the 
landowners does not justify expropriation; that the Constitution protects a 
landowner against indiscriminate and unwarranted expropriation; that to justify 
expropriation, it must be for a public purpose and public benefit, and that just 
to enable the tenants of a piece of land of reasonable area to own portions of 
it, even if they and their ancestors had cleared the land and cultivated it for 
their landlord for many years, is no valid reason or justification under the 
Constitution to deprive the owner or landlord of his property by means of 
expropriation.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the order appealed from is reversed; the motions 
for dismissal filed by defendants-appellants are granted; and the petition for 
expropriation is dismissed, with costs in both instances.</p>

<p>I vote to affirm the well prepared and cogently reasoned order of the Court 
of First Instance of Batangas which reads in full as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The original complaint for expropriation in this case was filed with this 
Court on February 6, 1951. In order to bring in other defendants, the original 
complaint was twice amended, and the second amended complaint substantially 
alleges the following: That the plaintiff, Republic of the Philippines, is 
represented in this action by the Director of Lands; that the property sought to 
be condemned consists of seven parcels of land, with a total area of 674,535 
square meters, situated in barrio Binubusan, Municipality of Lian, Province of 
Batangas, and more particularly described in the second amended complaint of the 
plaintiff; that the defendants Nelson V. Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis are the 
respective owners of the said property, while the remaining defendants are 
alleged purchasers of portions thereof belonging to defendant Cirilo P. 
Baylosis; that the said property was originally owned by the Colegio de San 
Jose, which sold it to defendant Nelson V. Sinclair, who, in turn, sold portions 
thereof to defendant Cirilo P. Baylosis; that this property is presently 
occupied by around forty-seven tenants, with around two hundred dependents, for 
whose benefit these expropriation proceedings have been instituted; that the 
said tenants and their predecessors-in-interest have been in possession of the 
said property from time immemorial, having introduced thereon improvements 
consisting of fillings, fences, buildings, fruit trees and other crops; that 
defendant Cirilo P. Baylosis, in an attempt to circumvent Commonwealth Act No. 
539, and with full knowledge of these contemplated condemnation proceedings, 
simulated transfer of portions of his property in favor of his co-defendants, 
except Nelson V. Sinclair, and caused transfer certificates of title to be 
issued in the names of said co-defendants, all for the purpose of defeating 
these proceedings; fhat some of the defendants have attempted to eject from, and 
disposses the tenants of, the property in question which the latter and their 
predecessors-in-interest have held from time immemorial, as a result of which 
acts, tenancy cases and other differences have arisen between landlords and 
tenants, and that the plaintiff needs to acquire title to and ownership of the 
property in question for the purpose of subdividing the same into small lots and 
selling the subdivided lots to tenants occupying the property, in keeping with 
the social amelioration program of the government to improve the lot of the 
tenants, to promote their interest and well-being, and thus to avoid and 
forestall social unrest. Premised upon the foregoing gist of the allegations of 
the second amended complaint plaintiff prays, among other things, that an order 
of condemnation be entered declaring tnat plaintiff has a lawful right to take 
the property sought to be condemned for the public use and purpose already 
mentioned upon payment of. just compensation to be determined by the court.</p>
<p>"On February 14, 1951, this Court, after first hearing the parties issued an 
order placing the plaintiff in possession of the property sought to be 
expropriated, after the said plaintiff had made a deposit of P27,105.22, 
pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of Rule 69 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p>"On September 24, 1951, the tenants in whose behalf these proceedings were 
instituted by plaintiff, put in a motion for intervention, accompanied by a 
complaint in intervention, in which complaint the said tenants take the very 
same position of, and make common cause with, the plaintiff in the latter's 
second amended complaint. In view of the fact, however, that the interests of 
the said tenants are sufficiently taken care of and defended by plaintiff's 
action, the said intervention is deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>"To plaintiff's second amended complaint, the various defendants interposed a 
total of nine separate motions for dismissal based upon the following principal 
grounds stated in brief outline: (1) that the property being expropriated is not 
for public use; (2) that by this expropriation, defendants are being deprived of 
their property without due process of law; (3) that this expropriation amounts 
to the taking of property from one private citizen and delivering it to another 
private individual; (4) that Executive Order No. 376 is null and void; (5) that 
the Bureau of Lands exceeded its authority when it seeks to. expropriate private 
properties of the defendants, instead of the Lian Estate; (6) that the 
Constitution authorizes the expropriation of big landed estates, and not of 
small areas like those at bar; (7) that this expropriation is intended to 
benefit only forty-four persons who do not represent the public; (8) that many 
of the said persons are already landowners in Lian; (9) that the said persons 
are not law-abiding and do not believe in democratic processes, and they are not 
lessees but only aparceros on a year to year contract basis; (10) that the said 
persons have not introduced any permanent improvements upon the property in 
question; (11) that the various defendants individually own only small portions 
of the property under expropriation; (12) that plaintiff's second amended 
complaint does not describe with certainty and definiteness the specific 
property sought to bft expropriated; (13) that the current price of irrigated 
rice lands in Lian, Batangas, is P3,000.00 per hectare, and plaintiff's deposit 
is insufficient, and (14) that defendants have suffered damages as a result of 
these proceedings. To defendant's motion for dismissal, the plaintiff has filed 
a written reply on May 14, 1951.</p>
<p>"Upon motion of Miguel Bascuguin, one of the forty-seven tenants mentioned in 
the second amended complaint, and without objection on the part of the 
plaintiff, this Court by order of October 30, 1951, excluded the said Miguel 
Bascuguin from these proceedings on the ground that he has not authorized anyone 
to file, and is not interested in, the same.</p>
<p>"The pleadings having thus been presented and the issues joined, the case 
came on for hearing on the underlying question of whether or not the plaintiff 
is entitled to expropriate the property in question, during which hearing the 
plaintiff and the defendants adduced their evidence in support of their 
respective stand upon the said question. The salient features of the saia 
evidence and the rival claims of the parties arising therefrom will in a moment 
be taken up.</p>
<p>"The factual background eventuating in the institution of the present 
proceedings is disclosed by documentary evidence brought forward by plaintiff. 
As far back as May 4, 1948, upon petition of certain tenants on the property of 
defendant N. V. Sinclair, the then manager of now defunct Rural Progress 
Administration addressed the following letter, Exhibit "B", to said 
defendant:</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>There has been received in this Office a petition for the acquisition by the 
Government for resale to the tenants of the following six lots in Binubusan, 
owned and/or administered by you:</p>
<p><em>Lot N. 306—CCCC under tax declaration No.

Sinclair.<br><em>Area</em>—14.3208 hectares.<br><em>Kind</em>—Fish 
pond.<br><em>Assessed value</em>—P5,730.</p>
<p>The reason given by the tenants in presenting their petition is that your 
relation with them is not altogether too satisfactory having on previous 
occasion tried to disregard the 70-30 crop sharing basis, although later have 
yielded to observance thereof upon the insistence of the tenants. They likewise 
complain that you are planning to eject them, a plan which if carried out, will 
result in untold sufferings on their part, without mentioning the pain of 
leaving the premises which they have occupied and tilled since time 
immemorial.</p>
<p>Before we take action on their petition we will appreciate your favor of 
informing us for your willingness to sell said parcels of land, in accordance 
with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 539 and the conditions of the 
sale.</p>

<p><br>"On November 14, 1950, the then Secretary of Justice wrote the following 
letter, Exhibit K, to the Executive Secretary in connection with the 
contemplated expropriation of the property of Atty, Baylosis:</p>
<blockquote>

recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Rural Progress Administration 
for acquisition either by direct purchase or expropriation proceedings of lands 
owned by Atty. C. Baylosis at Lian, Batangas. On this matter I would like to 
advise you that after proper study we have found that the acquisition of the 
said estate by the RPA is fully in accordance with law. All the necessary papers 
have been prepared and the necessary deposits already made. No further action, 
however, has been taken because of the lack of proper authority from the Office 
of the President to file the necessary proceedings in Court. To be able to go 
on' with the effectuation of the policy to which the Rural Progress 
Administration is committed, we therefore request that the said authority be 
given at the earliest possible time.<br></p>
<p align="right"><em>" 'Respectfully,</em></p>
<p align="right">" '(Sgd.) Jose P. Bengzon<br>Secretary of 
Justice'<br></p></blockquote>
<p>"The Presidential authority for the expropriation of the property in 
question, requested in the letter just quoted, was finally given on November 
25,1950, in a first indorsement by the Acting Assistant Executive Secretary 
marked Exhibit L of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>"From plaintiff's documentary evidence above set out, it appears that 
negotiations for the acquisition by the government of the property in question 
from the former owner, defendant N. V. Sinclair, for resale to the tenants 
occupying the same, have been afoot since May, 1948, thus disproving defendants' 
intimation that the present proceedings were started without prior and proper 
investigation. From the same evidence it further appears that both defendants N. 
V. Sinclair and Cirilo P. Baylosis were duly notified of, and were therefore 
well posted on, the contemplated move of the government either to directly 
purchase the said property or to expropriate the same, long before the said 
defendants allegedly sold portions thereof to their co-defendants, thereby 
legitimately giving rise to the suspicion that the alleged sales were for the 
purpose of frustrating the government's acquisition of the said property. And 
the fact that plaintiff actually started exproriation proceedings before this 
Court by filing its first original complaint on February 6, 1951, that is, 
following the procedure mailed out in Kuie 69 of the Rules of Court, is the 
refutation to defendants' claim that they are being deprived their property 
without due process of law.</p>
<p>"One of the basic contentions of the defendants is to the effect that no 
public utility, convenience or benefit is to be subserved by plaintiff's action, 
that is, that the property in question is not being expropriated for public use. 
The contention is met and overcome by strong evidence to the contrary. It is 
undenied and undeniable that the plaintiff seeks to expropriate the property in 
question for the avowed purpose of subdividing the same into small lots and 
selling the subdivided lots preferably to tenants actually occupying the same, 
or to other tenants with the requisite qualifications to effect such purchase. 
This purpose has both consitutional and statutory sanction. Section 4 of Article 
XIII of the Constitution provides that "The Congress may authorize upon payment 
of just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small 
lots and conveyed at costs to individuals." And section 1 of Commonwealth Act 
No. 539 provides that 'The President of the Philippines is authorized to acquire 
private lands or any interest therein, through purchase or expropriation, and to 
subdivide the same into home lots or small farms for resale at reasonable prices 
and under such conditions as he may fix to their bona fide tenants or occupants 
or to private individuals who will work the lands themselves and who are 
qualified to acquire and own lands in the Philippines'. It would thus seem plain 
that, in condemnation proceedings like the one at bar, public use, benefit, 
convenience, necessity, is inevitably and necessarily present as long as the 
purpose thereof and the property involved are those contemplated by the 
constitutional and stautory provisions just quoted. In other words, public 
purpose, etc., is inseparably bound up with the expropriation of property by the 
government for the purpose of subdividing the same into lots and selling the 
same to bona fide tenants, etc., the only material inquiry being whether or not 
the said property is that which the framers of the Constitution and the 
legislators had in mind when they drafts and approved the said constitutional 
and statutory provisions. This is so because the very purpose of the said 
expropriation, to wit, the subdivision of the property into lots and the sale 
thereof to tenants, is essentially and fundamentally public in nautre, being 
backed up by and founded upon the benign policy of the government to ameliorate 
the lot of a certain sector of our underprivileged population and thus, to some 
extent or degree, ease up, if not totally eradicate, the sources of social 
tension and upheavals.</p>
<p>"As above, intimated, the next question that calls for answer is whether or 
not the property here involved is that contemplated by the Constitution and the 
law. In this connection, and taking our cife from the decision of the Supreme 
Court in Guido vs. Rural Progress Administration, G. R. No. L-2089 (hereafter to 
be referred to as the. Guido case for short), we pose the following question: 
'What lands does this provision- (section 4 Artcle XIII of the Constitution) 
have in view? Does it comprehend all lands regardless of their location, nature 
and area? It is admitted on all sides that the property in question is irrigated 
agricultural land situated in barrio Bihubusan, Lian, Batangas. As to its area, 
plaintiff's second amended complaint places the same at something over 
sixty-seven hectares, while defendants, on page 3 and 4 of their memorandum 
makes the following admission with respect to said area:</p>
<p>"'The areas sought to be expropriated from the defendants are as 
follows:</p></blockquote>

<p>(Order—Civil Case No. 84 Republic of the Philippines vs. C. P. Baylosis et 
al.) </p>
<p>Summing up defendants' figures, it appears that the said area is 77.9018 
hectares. It may therefore be safely stated that the total area of the property 
in question is from sixty-seven to seventy-seven hectares. In the Guido case, it 
is intimated that the lands contemplated in section 4 of Article XIII of the 
Constitution have reference to 'large estates', in the light of the explanatory 
statement of the Delegate Miguel Cuaderno who was the sponsor of the said 
provision, for which reason, among others, the Supreme Court did not give its 
sanction to the expropriation of the property there involved which measured 
22,655 square meters, or a little over two hectares only. However, as the 
property here in question is from sixty-seven to seventy-seven hectares, an area 
which cannot be considered as small, this Court is of the opinion that the 
decision in the Guido case may not be invoked against, and does not stand in the 
way of, the expropriation of the property at bar. Moreover, aside from the 
standpoint of area, other considerations of weight, presently to be taken up, 
militate in favor of the present condemnation proceedings.</p>
<p>"The first of these considerations is the undeniable fact that the tenants 
for whose benefit the present proceedings have been instituted, and their 
predecessors-in-interest before them, have been in possession of the property in 
question from time immemorial, and that in the course of the said possession, 
they have cleaned, cleared and introduced improvements upon the said property. 
This is all but admitted on page 8 of defendants' memorandum wherein it is said, 
'The mere fact that these few occupants made temporary improvements, by 
constructing canals, dikes and irrigation dams, did not give any right to the 
government to expropriate the properties of the defendants who are entitled to 
the same protection under our laws.' The said occupation has been long 
continued, and the said improvements have been introduced, Under promise to, and 
in the reasonable belief, of, the. tenants that eventually their respective 
portions will be sold to them at cost or reasonable price. In view of the 
failure of the tenants to directly acquire the said property from the 
defendants, either because they cannot see eye to eye on the reasonable purchase 
price thereof or because of past and deep-rooted misunderstandings between them, 
it would appear that the only logical and legal course to take, in promotion of 
peace and in recognition of the tenant's preferential rights, is the 
expropriation by the plaintiff of the property in suit.</p>
<p>"Another equally potent consideration in favor of these condemnation 
proceedings is the further fact, likewise undeniable, that the defendant Cirilo 
P. Baylosis, has been far from harmonious, and that they have been perennially 
at loggerheads with respect to the division of the crops and other conflicting 
rights. A picture of the situation may be gleaned from page 1 of defendant's own 
memoran- dum reading as follows:</p>
<p>"'It has been proven that these occupants, who petitioned for the 
expropriation of these properties, are not law-abiding citizens because they 
refused to recognize property rights and the democratic processes of the 
Philippines, refusing to recognize the Tenancy Law. They refused to deliver to 
the owners, the defendants herein, their shares in the crop harvest. The owners, 
who are the defendants herein naturally had no other recourse but to bring the 
matter to the Courts of Justice for their grievances against the tenants and to 
recover their share in the harvest of the lands occupied by them. The plaintiff 
himself proved that there was no agrarian trouble on the properties in question, 
and there was no question whatsoever, on crop sharing, because the sharing is in 
accordance with the Tenancy Law. The only question involved on the lands in 
question is the refusal of the occupants to recognize the defendants as owners 
of the land occupied by them because of their desire to own and purchase the 
same. * * *'</p>
<p>The foregoing quoted portion of defendants' memorandum is a clear admission 
that all is not well between the tenants, on the one hand, and the defendants, 
on the other. Of course, defendants would throw the whole blame for the strained 
relation upon the tenants, but if the latter, in turn, are to be believed, it is 
the defendants who are the source of trouble. However, whoever is at fault is 
beside the point. The fact of the matter is that there is no love lost between 
the tenants and the defendants; that controversies between them have reached the 
courts, and that future disagreements may flare up into untoward incidents. In 
the teeth of these facts, as fertile imagination is necessary to predict the day 
when this situation may come to a critical head. Hence, the wisdom, if not the 
imperative necessity of giving due course to these condemnation proceedings in 
order to nip in the bud and put an end to an explosive source of agrarian 
trouble. To say that such an objective is not for a public purpose is simply 
beyond us.</p>
<p>"Still a third consideration that these expropriation proceedings are in 
order is the fact, also undenied, that defendants N.V. Sinclair and Cirilo P. 
Baylosis, who own the bulk of the property in question, had originally intended 
to resell their respective portions to others, possibly for a proat. This is 
shown by the admitted fact that the defendant N. V. Sinclair sold portions of 
the property to defendant Cirilo P. Baylosis, while the latter, in turn, had 
sold portions of what he purchased to his other co-defendants. It is lurtner 
shown by the following admission found on pages 3-4 of Exhibit 15-Caylosis of 
defendant Cinlo P. Baylosis:</p>
<p>"' That the actual occupants of his lands were offered by undersigned :</p>
<p>'1. To stay as tenant under the same conditions before his acquisition; 2. To 
purchase the lands under the cash basis; and 3. To buy the lands on the 
installment basis for a period of 50 years or at the period to be agreed upon. 
This offer which was made in writing and sent to Atty. Miguel Tolentino was 
rejected by the petitioners and their lawyer.'</p>
<p>Otherwise stated, the said defendants are ready and willing to resell their 
respective positions to others under such terms and conditions as they 
(defendants) may fix. This being the case, there seems to be no point and 
validity to their tenacious objection to these proceedings, the primary purppse 
of which is to buy the property from them through expropriation and thereafter 
to sub-divide the same into small lots for resale to bona fide tenants or other 
qualified persons.</p>
<p>"Finally, it is conceded on all side that portions of the Hacienda Lian, of 
which the property in question also used to be a part, had heretofore been 
acquired by the Government from the Colegio de San Jose, divided into lots and 
thereafter resold to tenants. It is evident therefore that, by its nature, 
lo-ation and destination the propertv in quest'on is suitable for the purpose 
for which it is being expropriated, and that these proceedings are in keeping 
with what the Government had already done with respect to other portions of the 
Hacienda, if the action for its expropriation prospers, would be broken up into 
small lots and sold to some forty-seven tenants with about two hundred 
dependents. This. Court does not overlook defendants' contention that at least 
four of the said tenants have already lands of their own aside from those 
portions of the property in question which they occupy. These alleged 
land-owning tenants, however, were included by plaintiff among those for whose 
benefit these proceedings were instituted, because they actually are tenants of 
portions of the property in question, hence, it would not seem fair or just that 
they be left out. In any event as observed by counsel for the plaintiff during 
the trial, when plaintiff is actually declared entitled to expropriate the 
property in question, it is for plaintiff to screen and process the tenants 
qualified to purchase the subdivided lots thereof, and if land-owning tenants 
are found disqualified to make said purchase, then the aforesaid four tenants 
may be ruled out from making said purchase. In fine, the fact that four of the 
forty-seven tenants have properties of their own aside from those portions 
occupied by them in the property in question, is no argument against these 
expropriation proceedings.</p>
<p>"The point is also stressed that defendant Cirilo P. Baylosis had a.ready 
sold portions of his property to his other co-defendants (except N. V. 
Sinclair,) and that the said co-defendants individually own only small portions 
thus sold tQ them, hence, the present expropriation in effect amounts to the 
taking of property from one private citizen and delivering it to another private 
citizen. The point loses much force when it is considered that all the said 
sales in favor of the co-defendants were made by defendant Cirilo P. Baylosis 
long after the latter was officially notified that the Government was 
contemplating to expropriate his property. The notice was served on him sometime 
on January 17, 1949, whereas the sales made by him are respectively dated as 
follows:</p>

<p>Add to what had just been said the further fact that most of the purchasers 
are close relatives of defendant Cirilo P. Baylosis, the striking proximity of 
the respective dates of sale, and the circumstances that the said defendant 
litigated alone with respect to said property in the tenancy cases which he 
filed with the Office of the Tenancy Law Enforcement Division—and mere suspicion 
crystalizes into strong persuasion that the said sales were simulated and 
calculated to head off and defeat the expropriation proceedings.</p>
<p>"Defendants' further claim that the property authorized to be expropriated is 
the Lian Estate, and not the property in question, is decisively answered by 
Exhibit K for the plaintiff, elsewhere quoted in this decision wherein it is 
stated that the Board of Directors of the Rural Progress Administration 
recommended the 'acquisition either by direct purchase or expropriation 
proceedings of lands owned by Atty. C. Baylosis at Lian, Batangas.' It is also 
argued that under section 3 of Lands Administrative Order No. R-3, approved on 
November 15, 1951, 'Except in special cases, no proceedings shall be initiated 
for the appropriation of an estate unless the area, thereof be * * * at least 
100 hectares if for agricultural purposes.' In the first place, this section 
came into force on November 15, 1951, whereas these proceedings were started on 
February 6, 1951. In the second place, the cited section makes exception of 
special cases, of which these proceedings may be o.ne in the light of the 
consideration above set out. And, in the third place, an administrative order 
has hardly the force and effect of law that is binding and controlling upon the 
courts. Defendants' claim that Executive Order No. 376 is null and void, has not 
been pressed or touched upon in their memoranda, and may therefore be deemed as 
abandoned.</p>
<p>"The facts of the Guido case which is cited in full and relied upon by 
defendants in their memoranda, are a far cry from those in the case at bar. 
There the land involved is commercial and measures a little over two hectares 
while here the property in question is irrigated agricultural land with an area 
of from sixty-seven to seventy-seven hectares. The property sought to be 
expropriated in the present proceedings have been occupied by tenants (for whose 
benefit it is being condemned) and by their predecessors-in-interest from time 
immemorial, having admittedly cleaned, cleared and introduced improvements 
thereupon, while these circumstances do not obtain in the cited Guido case. In 
the present case, one of the principal grounds for expropriation is to prevent 
the strained relation between the defendants and the tenants from degenerating 
into open disturbances of law and order, a situation which is not even intimated 
in the Guido case. Finally, as this Court grasps it, expropriation was denied in 
the Guido case because the proceedings therein were not clothed with a public 
purpose, whereas in the present case, as above stated, the condemnation of the 
property in question is not only in pursuance of constitutional and statutory 
provisions, but also in promotion of public peace and order.</p>
<p>"In view of all the foregoing, the separate motions to dismiss filed by the 
defendants are hereby overruled, and the plaintiff is hereby declared entitled 
to take the property sought, to be condemned for the public use described in 
plaintiff's second amended complaint, upon the payment of just compensation to 
be ascertained by commissioners to be appointed by the Court for this purpose, 
with the costs against the defendants."</p></blockquote>
<p>For the rest it is sufficient to state that the above quoted order is in 
complete accord with our decision promulgated on October 12, 1953 in G. R. No. 
L-4703, Rural Progress Administration vs. Clemente G. Reyes, wherein the lot 
expropriated is "much smaller than the parcels involved in the case at bar, the 
fundamental reason of the Court being that it formerly formed' part of a big 
landed estate and that "La extension del terreno no ese el unico factor que 
determiria su expropiabilidad. Para interpretar dicha ley hay que buscar 
inspiration en esta disposicion de la ley fundamental: 'El Estado cuidara de 
premover la juaticia social a fin de asegurar el bienestar y la estabilidad 
efionomica de todo el pueblo/ (Art. 5, Titulo II)." The majority may be correct 
if the basis of the present expropriation proceedings is merely the inherent 
power of the State to condemn private property for public use, and in the 
absence of section 4 of Article XIII of the Constitution which provides that 
"the Congress may authorize, upon payment of just compensation, the 
expropriation of lands to be subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to 
individuals.' It should furthermore be remembered that the Government is buying 
the lots in question for the benefit of some 244 actual occupants and, 
considering that barrio Binu-&gt; busan has a population of only about 1,000 
inhabitants, said number is obviously substantial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>REYES, J.B.L., J.</strong>, <em>dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>I am constrained to dissent from the opinion of the majority. The reasons set 
forth by it against the validity of the proposed expropriation strike me as 
arguments against the wisdom of the expropriation policies adopted by the 
government rather than reasons against the existence and application of the 
condemnation power in the present case.</p>
<p>The propriety of exercising the power of eminent domain under Article XIII, 
section 4 of our Constitution can not be determined on a purley quantitative or 
area basis. Not only does the constitutional provision speak of lands instead of 
<em>landed estates</em>, but I see no cogent reason why the government, in its 
quest for social justice and peace, should exclusively devote attention to 
conflicts of large proportions, involving a considerable number of individuals, 
and eschew small controversies and wait until they grow into a major problem 
before taking remedial action.</p>
<p>With due respect, the majority opinion proceeds on two assumptions, neither 
of which I consider justified: first, that section 4, Article XIII, is an end in 
itself, when actually it is but one of the jneans chosen by the framers of the 
Constitution to attain social justice, amelioration and tranquility; second, 
that the constitutional policy is attained by the breaking up of landed estates 
into smaller portions, entirely disregarding the constitutional directive that 
the lands condemned are to be "subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost 
to individuals", i.e., the tenants and occupants. Expropriation, subdivision and 
resale to tenants and occupants are inseparable components of the constitutional 
scheme. Plainly, agrarian discontent can not be quelled, nor peace and security 
achieved while tenants must continue to labor for others, and are not converted 
into small owners themselves. There is no magic solution in the transformation 
of a conflict between many tenants and one landlord into a series of conflicts 
between many tenants and several landlords. The wasteful controversy will 
remain, and in fact will become more troublesome and expensive to settle, 
because each landowner will demand individual treatment of his own case.</p>
<p>Even if we adhere strictly to the views adopted in the Guido decision, that 
the constitution aimejl solely at breaking up large landed estates, the 
propriety of the proposed condemnation in the instant case is evident, since it 
is unquestioned that the lands here involved were originally part of the Lian 
Estate in 1935, when the Constitution was adopted. What large estates could have 
been contemplated by the constitutional provision if not those in existence at 
the time of its adoption? The conclusion must be that (as held in R.P.A. vs. 
Reyes, G. R. No. L-4703, October 8, 1953), all lands of the Lian Estate since 
1935 became liable to condemnation for the benefit of the tenants, and any 
subsequent acquirer of these lands took them subject to that burden or 
infirmity. The reasons why these new landlords should not be allowed to escape 
expropriations have been previously stated and need not be repeated.</p>
<p>The majority says that the fact that the tenants and occupants of the land 
have by themselves and their ancestors been occupying and cultivating the same 
for many years is not sufficient justification for the expropriation. This is 
not the place to discuss whether actual producers deserve preferential treatment 
by the State, nor the demerits of absentee landlordism. It is enough to recall 
that this sense of injustice of the tenants is of ancient vintage and was 
already expressed through the symbolic "Cabesang Tales" in Rizal's "El 
Filibusterismo" :—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Podeis hacer lo que querais, señor Gobernador, yo soy un ignorante y no 
tengo fuerzas. Pero he cultivado esos campos, mi y mi hija han muerto ayudandome 
a limpiarlos, y no los de ceder sino a que 61 que pueda hacer por ellos mas de 
lo he hecho yo. Quelos riegue primero con su sangre y que entierre en ellos a su 
esposa y su hija;"</p></blockquote>
<p>Legally justified or not, such a feeling has in the past led to "impairments 
of public tranquility", and the records of the constitutional convention leave 
no doubt that in enacting Article XIII, section 4, the Convention precisely 
sought to avoid its resurgence.</p>
<p>The Constitution considered the small individual land tenure to be so 
important to the maintenance of peace and order and to the promotion of progress 
and the general welfare that it not only provided for the expropriation and 
subdivision of lands but also opened the way for the limitation of private land 
holdings (Art. XIII, section 3). It is not for this Court to judge the worth of 
these and other social and economic policies expressed by the Constitution; our 
duty is to conform to such policies and not to block their realization.</p>
<p>I am willing to concede that where the Legislature delegates to subordinate 
agencies the selection of lands to be expropriated, without setting up adequate 
standards to guide official action, the Courts may intervene to prevent abuses; 
but I am unable to see in the present case any warrant for judicial 
intervention. The objection that the areas sought to be expropriated are not 
defined can be corrected by resort to a motion for particulars under Rule 16; 
and the allegedly low price that the tenants wish to pay for the lands involved 
is not controlling on Courts that are sworn to award just compensation.</p>
