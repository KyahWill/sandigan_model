				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This case came before this  Court on  a petition for certiorari filed by  Bias Elnar praying  for the review of the decision rendered by the Court of Appeals on September  26, 1957, affirming the  judgment of the  lower  court which holds that its decision  on the merits has already become final and executory.</p>
<p>This petition  stems from a case  originally filed before the  Court  of First Instance of Negros Oriental wherein Bias Elnar prayed to be declared the owner of a parcel of land known as  Lot No. 1182  of the Cadastral Survey of Dumaguete.  Decision was rendered in favor of defendants declaring them the owners of the land  and awarding in their favor  attorney's fees  in the amount of  P1,000.00. Plaintiff  filed  a  motion for reconsideration, which was denied, and when he tried to  appeal from the decision, the trial court declared that the motion for reconsideration he had filed was  merely <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span>  and did not suspend the  running of the period  to appeal.  Accordingly,  the trial court held that its  decision was already  final and executory.
        
</p>
<p>Plaintiff filed a petition for mandamus with the Court of Appeals in an attempt to secure  an order directing the trial  court to give due course to his appeal, but  the Court of Appeals in a decision  rendered on  September 26, 1957, denied the petition.  Hence the present petition for review.
          
</p>
<p>It appears that the trial  court rendered  judgment  in the main case on February 18, 1957, dismissing  plaintiff's complaint but ordering him to pay defendants the sum of P1,000.00 as attorney's fees and the  costs of action.  Notice  of  this decision was served on  plaintiff's counsel on March  28, 1957.  On April 25,  1957, plaintiff's  counsel filed a motion for reconsideration or new trial.   On May 9, 1957, the  trial  court denied the motion holding that it was  merely <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> and as such  did not suspend the period to appeal.  This ruling was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The question to be determined  is  whether said motion for reconsideration or new trial is merely<i> pro forma</i> and did not suspend the period to appeal. Because of its  intimate bearing on our discussion  we quote hereunder the motion under consideration:

<p> Under section 2, Rule 37, a  motion for new trial shall be made in writing stating the ground or grounds therefor, notice of  which  shall be served on the adverse party. When the motion is made upon the  ground that "the evidence was insufficient  to justify the  decision, or it is against the  law," the motion shall  point out specifically the findings or conclusion of the judgment which are  not supported  by the evidence or which are contrary to law, making express reference to the testimonial or  documentary evidence or to the provisions of law alleged to be contrary to such findings or conclusions.</p>
<p>Former Chief Justice Moran, commenting on the abovementioned provisions, says: "Where a motion for new trial is filed under the third paragraph of this section and fails 'to point out specifically the findings or conclusions of the judgment which are not supported by the evidence or which are contrary to law, making express reference to the testimonial or documentary evidence or to the provisions of law alleged to be contrary to such findings or conclusions',  it shall be treated as a motion <i>pro forma</i> intended merely to delay the proceedings and it shall not interrupt or suspend the period of time for the perfection of an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> However, where the motion for  reconsideration was based on a claim that the finding of the trial court  as to the authenticity of the disputed signature was  not justified by the evidence submitted, which  is the testimony of the expert witness denying such authenticity, <i>the motion points out why the finding of the court is  not justified by the evidence, and is clearly not a pro forma motion for new trial or  reconsideration;</i>  such motion  for reconsideration suspends the period for perfecting an appeal." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>Analyzing the averments made by petitioner in his motion for reconsideration we find that he attributes to the trial court two  errors: One is on "questions of fact" and another on "questions  of  law." As  to the former, he points out the findings or conclusions of the trial court which in his opinion are not supported by the evidence, although he  does not make any express reference to such evidence, and as to the latter he also points out specifically the findings or conclusions which in his opinion are contrary to law.  We likewise find that plaintiff expressly reserved his right to submit written or oral argument to substantiate his motion within such period of time as the Court may grant him, which request was however ignored when the Court denied outright his motion for reconsideration.
                                          
We believe that the above averments  when considered in the light of the decision on the merits may be considered substantial compliance with the rule and may come under the exception pointed out by former Chief Justice Moran.  Here is where we may properly apply the principle that the rules shall be liberally construed in order to promote the interest of justice.
                                          
Another reason why the petition for mandamus was dismissed by the Court of Appeals is the allegation not denied by respondent that as of June 14, 1957, long before said petition was filed, plaintiff has satisfied  the judgment of the trial court from which he is now seeking to appeal. This point needs clarification.  Plaintiff's main action is to recover the ownership and possession of a parcel  of land which was dismissed by the trial court even it awarded to defendants attorney's fees in the amount of P1,000.00. It is from this dismissal that plaintiff is now appealing although incidentally he is also disputing the award of attorney's fees. What was executed over plaintiff's opposition is the award of attorney's fees.  Payment, therefore, of said fees cannot  be deemed an  abandonment  of his appeal from the dismissal of his main cause of action.  Even then such payment cannot be taken  as abandonment because it was forced upon him through a writ of execution. And considering that under our rule a judgment may be executed even pending appeal if the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion,  finds good reasons therefor (sec. 2, Rule 39), there is no plausible reason for holding that payment by plaintiff of said attorney's fees constitutes an abandonment of his appeal.
                                          
Wherefore, the decision  appealed from is reversed. The trial court  is hereby ordered to give due course to the appeal of petitioner.</p>
