				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This&nbsp; is a petition for certiorari to annul certain orders issued by&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent judge&nbsp; in Civil&nbsp; Case&nbsp; No. 1407 of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Occidental&nbsp; Misamis denying relief&nbsp; from the judgment rendered therein and authorizing the execution of said judgment.<br><br>It appears that the civil&nbsp; case&nbsp; mentioned&nbsp; was initiated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; herein&nbsp; petitioner Gelacio&nbsp; Bodiongan with&nbsp; a complaint filed on&nbsp; September 4,&nbsp; 1951&nbsp; for&nbsp; the recovery&nbsp; of possession of a truck, which,&nbsp; so it was alleged, had been mortgaged&nbsp; and delivered&nbsp; to&nbsp; him&nbsp; by Antonio&nbsp; Barrientos, one of&nbsp; the defendants therein, but&nbsp; which,&nbsp; through force and intimidation and&nbsp; without the mortgage debt having been&nbsp; paid off,&nbsp; was&nbsp; later "snatched" by the said Antonio Barrientos&nbsp; and,&nbsp; without plaintiff's knowledge, sold,&nbsp; first to&nbsp; Roman Mabanag&nbsp; and&nbsp; later&nbsp; to the&nbsp; other defendant Prudencio&nbsp; Revelo.&nbsp; Mabanag intervened&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; claimed ownership of the truck through&nbsp; purchase from Antonio Barrientos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff impugned the purchase as made in bad faith and in&nbsp; violation of the&nbsp; chattel mortgage&nbsp; law, and&nbsp; then&nbsp; amended&nbsp; his&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; to&nbsp; include&nbsp; Policarpio Barrientos as party defendant, alleging that the latter had also&nbsp; mortgaged a&nbsp; truck to him but had failed to pay the mortgage within the time&nbsp; stipulated.&nbsp; The&nbsp; amended com- plaint, therefore, prayed for the return of the truck taken from&nbsp; plaintiff by&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Antonio Barrientos and for the&nbsp; foreclosure&nbsp; of the&nbsp; chattel&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; constituted on the other truck by the other defendant Policarpio Barrientos.&nbsp; The defendants filed their answer to the*'amended complaint, and plaintiff, on his part, filed a reply to&nbsp; the said&nbsp; answer.&nbsp; And with the issues thus joined and with most&nbsp; of the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; already presented,&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; to the action submitted an agreement signed&nbsp; by themselves and their respective attorneys with the request that judgment be rendered in accordance therewith.&nbsp; In view thereof, the court rendered its decision, dated September 25, 1953, quoting and approving the agreement aforementioned and ordering the&nbsp; parties to comply with its terms.<br><br>The&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; reads:<br><blockquote><center>"BETWEEN&nbsp; PLAINTIFF BODIONGAN AND&nbsp; INTERVENOR ROMAN&nbsp; MABANAG</center><ol><li> That&nbsp; the&nbsp; truck&nbsp; claimed by the&nbsp; Intervenor Roman&nbsp; Mabanag in the above&nbsp; entitled case shall remain with and belong&nbsp; to&nbsp; the herein&nbsp; plaintiff, Gelacio Bodiongan, whose ownership thereof&nbsp; Intervenor and defendant hereby recognize and respect;<br></li><li> That&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Gelaejo Bodiongan&nbsp; shall pay&nbsp; the intervenor Roman Mabanag the sum of SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED PESOS&nbsp; (P6,900.00)&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; currency,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P2,500.00 is hereby&nbsp; paid,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the Intervenor Roman&nbsp; Mabanag acknowledges to have received the&nbsp; same;<br></li><li> That the&nbsp; balance of P4,400.00 with 8 per cent interest shall be paid by the said plaintiff&nbsp; Bodiongan within a period of one&nbsp; (1) year in twelve (12)&nbsp; monthly&nbsp; installments, to wit;&nbsp; the sum of P366.66 within the first&nbsp; 5&nbsp; days after&nbsp; the end of&nbsp; each and every month effective October 1,&nbsp; 1953;<br></li><li> That&nbsp; should plaintiff&nbsp; fail&nbsp; to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; first four&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; or&nbsp; any four (4)&nbsp; installments as&nbsp; above specified, the whole sum&nbsp; shall thereby become due and payable, and execution&nbsp; shall issue on the Judgment&nbsp; rendered based on this agreement. </li></ol><center>BETWEEN&nbsp; PLAINTIFF&nbsp; BODIONGAN&nbsp; AND&nbsp;&nbsp; DEFENDANT ANTONIO BARRIENTOS:</center><ol><li>&nbsp; That&nbsp; plaintiff Gelaejo Bodiongan shall return&nbsp; and deliver to "defendant Antonio Barrientos in good working condition and properly&nbsp; equipped and fit for TPU operation&nbsp; his passenger truck subject&nbsp; of&nbsp; the controversy between them in&nbsp; this case;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That&nbsp; the work&nbsp; in&nbsp; putting the said&nbsp; truck in&nbsp; good&nbsp; working condition&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; done&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; DERONG REPAIR&nbsp; SHOP&nbsp; at Ozamis City&nbsp; and&nbsp; that all the&nbsp; expanses incurred therein including labor, costs&nbsp; of spare parts and other services,&nbsp; shall be form exclusively by the plaintiff;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That&nbsp; the&nbsp; delivery&nbsp; of the&nbsp; said truck&nbsp; in the conditions above stated&nbsp; shall be made to&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant at&nbsp; Ozamis&nbsp; City within&nbsp; a period of two (2)&nbsp; months from the date&nbsp; of this agreement;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That&nbsp; in satisfaction of the claim&nbsp; of&nbsp; the plaintiff, defendant Antonio Barrientos shall pay to him the sum of FIVE&nbsp; HUNDRED PESOS (P500.00) within the period of two (2) months from the date the passenger truck above referred to is delivered to and received by the defendant;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That&nbsp; in&nbsp; case&nbsp; of failure&nbsp; of the plaintiff to comply with&nbsp; the obligation&nbsp; above stated, the&nbsp; Court shall order&nbsp; the&nbsp; repair of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; truck at the&nbsp; expense of&nbsp; the said&nbsp; plaintiff;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That&nbsp; in&nbsp; ease&nbsp; of failure of the said&nbsp; defendant Antonio&nbsp; Barrientos to&nbsp; pay the sum&nbsp; herein above stated, the said truck shall answer for the said amount in the form oÂ£ security."</li></ol></blockquote> On&nbsp; December 10,&nbsp; 1953, the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Antonio&nbsp; Barrientos filed a motion&nbsp; alleging that plaintiff&nbsp; had failed to return&nbsp; the truck to the said defendant&nbsp; within the&nbsp; two months stipulated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the agreement and&nbsp; praying,&nbsp; among' other things, that the court order the truck&nbsp; repaired at plaintiff's expense and that the sum of P7,717, the estimated cost of repairs be deposited&nbsp; with the city treasurer from whom the&nbsp; repair shop was to draw such amounts as might&nbsp; be needed from&nbsp; time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion contains a notice&nbsp; to&nbsp; plaintiff himself that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; submitted for the resolution of the court at 8 o'clock a.m.&nbsp; on December 15, 1953 and also a statement that copy thereof had been sent&nbsp; by registered mail to plaintiff&nbsp; on the&nbsp; 10th of that month.&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; objection having&nbsp; been made to the motion, the respondent judge, on December 15, rendered an order in open court directing&nbsp; the clerk of court to&nbsp; execute the decision&nbsp; in accordance with what was prayed for in said motion.&nbsp; But it&nbsp; would&nbsp; appear that,&nbsp; at the&nbsp; instance of plaintiff, the effectivity of the&nbsp; order&nbsp; was&nbsp; suspended so as to give him time to comply&nbsp; with the agreement&nbsp; and that,&nbsp; before&nbsp; the period&nbsp; of&nbsp; grace had&nbsp; expired,&nbsp; plaintiff delivered the truck to the&nbsp; clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; court.<br><br>On March&nbsp; 9, 1954 and then again on the 22nd of that month,&nbsp; Antonio Barrientos filed a second motion. for execution, alleging that the truck delivered by Bodiongan to the clerk of&nbsp; court was not in good working&nbsp; condition and was&nbsp; disapproved&nbsp; for registration&nbsp; by the&nbsp; office of the&nbsp; district engineer, for&nbsp; which reason the movant prayed that the order suspending execution be lifted.&nbsp; On March 26 plaintiff filed his&nbsp; opposition&nbsp; to&nbsp; the second&nbsp; motion for execution, but on the following&nbsp; day, March 27, the date set for&nbsp; the hearing of the motion,&nbsp; the court,&nbsp; finding the motion&nbsp; well&nbsp; founded,&nbsp; handed&nbsp; down an order&nbsp; (similar to the one rendered on&nbsp; December 15)&nbsp; requiring plaintiff to deposit with the city treasurer the sum of P7,717, the estimated costs of repairs, and&nbsp; directing&nbsp; a levy&nbsp; on his property to&nbsp; cover&nbsp; that&nbsp; amount&nbsp; should&nbsp; he fail&nbsp; to&nbsp; do so within 15 days.&nbsp; On April 14,&nbsp; plaintiff asked for a reconsideration of this last order, but&nbsp; the motion having been found&nbsp; to be groundless and&nbsp; without&nbsp; merit,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court handed&nbsp; down an&nbsp; order, dated July 3, 1954, directing that its order of&nbsp; March 27, 1954 be immediately executed.<br><br>Five&nbsp; days&nbsp; thereafter,&nbsp; that is, on July&nbsp; 8, 1954, plaintiff served notice on&nbsp; the court that he was changing counsel and that thereafter Cayetano P.&nbsp; Paderanga was to be his attorney "of record"&nbsp; in place&nbsp; of the attorneys-of-record, Attys. Crispin C.&nbsp; Labaria and Ceferino&nbsp; E.&nbsp; Paredes"&nbsp; and on that same day plaintiff also filed&nbsp; a verified petition to have the aforementioned agreement of September 5, 1953 and the decision rendered in accordance there with, as well as the orders thereafter handed&nbsp; down, sot aside, on&nbsp; the grounds&nbsp; (1) that&nbsp; plaintiff had affixed his signature&nbsp; to said agreement&nbsp; after&nbsp; the respondent judge&nbsp; had&nbsp; exerted pressure and undue influence upon him to the&nbsp; extent&nbsp; of making the judge's action in&nbsp; that&nbsp; regard amount to&nbsp; a fraud;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that fraud was also&nbsp; committed&nbsp; when notice of hearing of the motions for&nbsp; execution, and&nbsp; the motion for reconsideration was not served on his attorney; (3) that the order for&nbsp; execution dated March 27 was "manifestly unconscionable,&nbsp; highly oppressive,&nbsp; evidently unreasonab!e, and contrary&nbsp; to law;"&nbsp; and (4)&nbsp; that plaintiff had sufficient,&nbsp; valid&nbsp; and sound&nbsp; causes of action against the other party litigants.&nbsp;&nbsp; In an&nbsp; <i>ex parte</i> motion&nbsp; separately filed on that same day, plaintiff, through his new attorney, asked the respondent judge to " disqualify or inhibit himself from&nbsp; further&nbsp; acting&nbsp; in the instant case on grounds of propriety and delicacy."<br><br>Opposing the petition for relief, the defendant Antonio Barrientos&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; imputations of fraud and judicial pressure and undue influence therein contained and called attention to the fact&nbsp; that the&nbsp; said petition was too late, the&nbsp; same having been&nbsp; filed more than 9&nbsp; months&nbsp; after the decision sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; set aside.&nbsp; Finding the opposition "to&nbsp; be well-founded, in that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition for relief has been filed out of time&nbsp; as&nbsp; provided for in Section 3, Rule 38,"&nbsp; the court under&nbsp; date of August 28, 1954&nbsp; rendered an order denying the&nbsp; said petition, and&nbsp; on September 11 issued another order directing the, clerk of court "to&nbsp; issue a writ of execution&nbsp; as prayed for."<br><br>On&nbsp; September 18, plaintiff filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion asking for a reconsideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; order of August&nbsp; 28,&nbsp; denying his petition for relief; and the&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; reconsideration having&nbsp; been&nbsp; denied,&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp; filed&nbsp; the&nbsp; present petition for certiorari in this Court on October 2, 1954, alleging that the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; judge,&nbsp; gravely&nbsp; abused his discretion&nbsp; in ignoring his&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; disqualification and&nbsp; also acted arbitrarily and with bias in&nbsp; passing upon and denying the petition for relief in which the said judge's " own actuations have been&nbsp; questioned and put in&nbsp; issue,"&nbsp; declaring the said petition out of&nbsp; time&nbsp; and not applying the ruling of his Court in the case of Jose Samaniada vs. Epifanio Mata, et al., 92 Phil., 426.<br><br>After&nbsp; going over&nbsp; the record, we agree with&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent trial&nbsp; judge that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for&nbsp; relief was&nbsp; out of time, it appearing that it was filed more than nine months after&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision sought to&nbsp; be&nbsp; set&nbsp; aside&nbsp; was rendered.<br><br>Arguing that&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; was&nbsp; filed on&nbsp; time, petition cites in the case of Samaniada vs.&nbsp; Mata, <i>supra</i>.&nbsp; We find the&nbsp; citation not&nbsp; in&nbsp; point.&nbsp; Though the judgment&nbsp; in that case was also based on a&nbsp; compromise agreement, that judgment was&nbsp; not&nbsp; considered final&nbsp; because a&nbsp; commissioner designated by the parties was&nbsp; still to segregate from a disputed parcel of land the portion to be awarded to one of the parties and this Court said that "for all practical purposes the proceedings&nbsp; after the compromise&nbsp; agreement was a partition of real estate" which, according&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Rules, needed court approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was, therefore, there held that the decision based on the agreement did not become final until after the submission of the report by the commissioner en segregation&nbsp; and its&nbsp; approval by the parties&nbsp; and&nbsp; the court, so that the period to file the petition for relief&nbsp; did not commence to run from the date&nbsp; of the decision but only after the court had acted on the&nbsp; commissioner's report. In the present&nbsp; case, however, the agreement of the parties contained nothing which would&nbsp; require&nbsp; subsequent court approval.&nbsp; All that remained&nbsp; for the court to do was to enforce its&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp; The fact that&nbsp; the court could, at that stage&nbsp; of&nbsp; the proceeding,&nbsp; still&nbsp; act&nbsp; in the ease in&nbsp; the proceeding for execution, does not&nbsp; make the judgment to be executed any the less final.<br><br>Petitioner makes capital of&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; the respondent judge issued&nbsp; his order&nbsp; denying&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; for relief without first deciding the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; his&nbsp; disqualification for&nbsp; reasons of&nbsp; "propriety and delicacy".&nbsp; These, however, are&nbsp; no legal grounds for disqualifying&nbsp; a&nbsp; judge,&nbsp; and while it is&nbsp; true that the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; judge did not expressly declare himself qualified, still in&nbsp; denying the petition for relief instead of withdrawing from the&nbsp; case, he must be deemed to have in effect decided in favor of his compentency.&nbsp; At any rate, the question&nbsp; of whether or not the respondent judge should have disqualified himself&nbsp; from taking cognizance of the petition for relief is really of no importance, considering that the&nbsp; said&nbsp; petition was, as. the&nbsp; record does show,&nbsp; filed more than nine&nbsp; months&nbsp; after the&nbsp; decision sought&nbsp; to be set aside and,&nbsp; therefore, beyond the&nbsp; period allowed by section 3&nbsp; of Rule 88.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; denied&nbsp; with&nbsp; cost&nbsp; against the&nbsp; petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
