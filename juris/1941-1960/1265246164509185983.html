				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> At the outbreak of the war in 1941 appellant was serving 
sentence in the San Ramon Penal Farm where he was assigned as assistant chief of 
the machinery and engineering division. He says that he was also designated by 
USAFFE Major Pitcher to take charge of the observation squadron of the Penal 
Colony, and, as such observer, he was ordered, together with the superintendent 
of the institution, Severo Yap, to burn the wharf in Recodo, get some machinery 
and truck nearby and bring them to San Ramon. At the time there was a jail break 
and so he, together with some guards, was ordered to apprehend the escapees. 
According to him, he was later on pardoned by President Quezon, and the order of 
pardon was received by the superintendent, of the colony, a copy of which was 
handed to him in the early part of 1942.
<p align="justify">After the Japanese had landed in Zamboanga, defendant was made 
a commander of the "Kaigun Juitai", a military organization attached to the 
Japanese naval police of Zamboanga. As such he was authorized to possess a .45 
caliber revolver, a Japanese saber, and a "caborata" and to wear a uniform of 
blue denim shirt and pants and an olive green cap with an anchor at the front. 
He allowed his beard to grow down to his chest.</p>
<p align="justify">Accompanied by his daughter Olimpia, Ramon B. Alvarez went in 
the afternoon of November 16, 1943, for a friendly visit to Otto Galle, a 
German-born naturalized Filipino citizen and owner of a one thousand hectare 
coconut plantation known as <i>Patalon</i>. Ramon was met by Heddy, Galle's 
daughter and wife of Dr. Eduardo del Rosario. She told him that if he had not 
cone, she would have called for him. She brought him to an adjoining building 
which housed the canteen where Dr. Del Rosario's house was also located. Del 
Rosario handed a note conceived as follows: "I would like you to come here at 
Cadalogan at 6 a.m., sharp for a conference. In coming to that place just come 
alone. (Sgd.) Berenguer, 1st Lt. Infant."</p>
<p align="justify">Because the letter was delivered by one Ernesto, a nephew of 
appellant's wife, Mrs. Del Rosario had misgivings about the authenticity of the 
letter. Alvarez suspected it to be fake and as a trick of appellant to meet Del 
Rosario, because he knew that Lieutenant Berenguer was then in Dipolog and could 
not be in Cadalogan, within the jurisdiction of Zamboanga. Besides, Berenguer 
was only a second infantry lieutenant.</p>
<p align="justify">The fact that the owner of the <i>Patalon</i> plantation used 
to give the guerrillas a monthly contribution of P150, some medicine, coffee and 
other foodstuffs and the fact that some members of the resistance movement used 
to visit Galle's house strengthened the worries and fears of Alvarez and the Del 
Rosario spouses. Alvarez advised that the note must not be answered and that a 
sailboat be prepared in order to leave the place when necessary. Otto Galle 
requested Alvarez to pass the night in <i>Patalon.</i> Although he himself 
entertained fears that he might be implicated if found in the Galle residence, 
Alvarez consented to remain in the place for the night with his daughter.</p>
<p align="justify">After supper and when Alvarez had already retired to the room 
assigned to him, a voice from the yard outside was heard calling for Dr. Del 
Rosario. The latter went to a window and asked who was calling, and the answer 
was: "The one who arrived," which was understood by the inmates of the house to 
be that the one who answered was or pretended to be a guerrilla.</p>
<p align="justify">Those in the house assembled in the sala. Heddy, del Rosario 
came telling that: "it is exactly 10:05." After a conference, Del Rosario took 
his wrist watch and handed it to Alvarez telling him; "give it to them." Alvarez 
was about to follow the suggestion but in the middle of the stairs he became 
afraid and told Galle that he could not comply as it was dangerous for him to do 
so. Galle took the wrist watch and went downstairs with a light in his right 
hand, but returned because he was ordered by the men outside to put out the 
light. When he went down again he was followed by Alvarez. There he met the 
appellant.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant Moreno asked Alvarez for Del Rosario and ordered 
Galle to go with him outside. Galle refused and so Moreno struck him. Then Galle 
said: "You can do anything you want." Whereupon, shots were heard and Galle fell 
down.</p>
<p align="justify">Heddy del Rosario sounded the alarm, but Moreno shouted: "Stop 
that sounding and put out the light." When the light was about to be put out, 
another shot was fired which entered the room where Olimpia Alvarez was, and so 
Alvarez ran and jumped to the other side of the barbed wire fence, then went 
down to a brook and hid in a bamboo grove.</p>
<p align="justify">The next morning, at about 6 o'clock, Moreno came again with 
his men and started firing many shots at the house. Sometime later, Alvarez was 
able to count more than two hundred empty shells in the yard. During the firing 
that morning Alvarez and his daughter were able to escape by the back yard to 
about two hundred meters away where they took a vinta and went to Talisayan. 
Alvarez saw Galle's house burning.</p>
<p align="justify">Within the house ten persons were killed, Otto Galle, his wife 
Ines, Eduardo del Rosario, Heddy del Rosario, Nene del Rosario, Fred del 
Rosario, two maids Alejandra and Gregoria, Cristino Geronimo and Andres Fabian. 
According to Elena Casongcay, a maid who was able to, witness the proceeding 
from a hidden place near the fenee, after the assailants had looted the house of 
its many personal belongings, Moreno ordered his men to burn it. Blas Francisco, 
a worker in the service of Galle and who had survived from that holocaust, 
substantially corroborated both Alvarez and Elena Casongcay.</p>
<p align="justify">On April 22, 1944, appellant also took active part in the 
arrest in Labuan of Eulogio and Dionisio Biel and of Enrique Fargas, made by a 
group of Japanese and Filipino soldiers. The two Biels were arrested because of 
the help they were giving to the guerrillas. The three arrested persons were at 
about 4 o'clock in the afternoon taken in a truck to San Ramon Penal Colony and 
on April 28 they were seen by Filoteo being escorted by Japanese soldiers on a 
truck bound for the City Hall Building of Zamboanga. None of them were ever 
heard of or seen alive since then. These facts are proven by the testimonies of 
Patrocinio Vda. de Biel, Agueda Vda. de Biel, Romula Biel, Fermin Filoteo and 
Mamerto de Leon.</p>
<p align="justify">In the morning of February 11, 1944, another patrol of armed 
Japanese and "<i>Kaigun Juitai</i>" Filipino soldiers, led by appellant as one 
of the leaders, arrived at the house of Venancio Ventura in Boongan, Isabela de 
Basilan, Zamboanga. Several persons in the house were called by the members of 
the patrol for investigation. After Eduardo Ventura, one of the members of the 
patrol, had started to make investigation about the guerrillas and their 
activities in the place, shots were fired from a nearby hill directed towards 
the patrol, the members of which laid flat on the ground and returned the shots. 
The firing lasted almost half an hour. While the firing was going on, Prudencio 
and Raymundo Nonial ran away to a nearby bush and were able to escape. After the 
shooting had ceased, Moreno and his companions continued investigating Agustin 
and Claro Nonial regarding the whereabouts of Ramon and Miguel Nonial, 
lieutenant and surgeon respectively of the guerrillas at Bangue. Because of 
their denials, they were slapped and struck with fist blows. Agustin Ventura, 
Venancio Ventura, Claro Nonial, Agustin Nonial, Agustin Laracochea and Victor 
Garcia were ordered to inarch in single file. After they had walked for about 
thirty meters, Eduardo Ventura ordered them to turn to the left and on 
appellants order, he machine-gunned them all, Agustin and Claro Nonial were 
instantly killed, while the four others were wounded. The left arm of Laracochea 
was later amputated.</p>
<p align="justify">The above facts were testified to by Agustin Laracochea, 
Prudencio Nonial, Venancio Ventura and Victor Garcia.</p>
<p align="justify">During the first week of August, 1944, Toribio Timonel, Candido 
Cabrera and Daniel del Rio, all imprisoned guerrillas, were investigated by 
appellant, who took part in the maltreatment of the first two. Ramon Camagay and 
Hermenegildo A. Santos testified to these facts. Since then these three 
guerrillas were never seen nor heard of anymore.</p>
<p align="justify">The trial court found the appellant guilty of treason, 
complexed with multiple murder of fifteen persons, and sentenced him to suffer 
the penalty of death in the manner prescribed by law and to pay a fine of 
P10,000, to pay indemnity of P2,000 to each of the heirs of Otto Galle, Ines 
Galle, Eduardo del Rosario, Heddy del Rosario, Nene del Rosario, Fred del 
Rosario, maid Alejandra, maid Gregoria, Cristino Geronimo, Andres Fabian, 
Eulogio Biel, Dionisio Biel, Enrique Fargas, Agustin Nonial and Claro Nonial, 
and to pay the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for the appellant assign in their brief eight alleged 
errors of the trial court. We shall now consider them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">I</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in denying the petition of appellant for 
the postponement of the hearing to enable his counsel to prepare his defense 
properly, a right which is granted him by our fundamental 
laws."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">At the start of the trial, appellant's counsel moved for the 
postponement of the hearing in order to prepare properly for the defense, 
stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Your honor, please.—My services was just hired by the family 
of the accused, so we ask for the postponement of the trial of the case in order 
to prepare properly our defense." (1).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The petition was not granted. The accused was arraigned and the 
trial proceeded.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant now invokes the provision of Section 7 of Rule 114, 
Rules of Court, which reads, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 7. Time to prepare for trial.—After a plea of not guilty, 
except when the case is on appeal from the justice of the peace, the defendant 
is entitled to at least two days to prepare for trial unless the court for good 
cause shown shall allow further time."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The prosecution contends that appellant cannot invoke the above 
provision, because the petition was made <i>before the arraignment</i>, and the 
proper time for filing the petition is after <i>arraignment</i> and a plea of 
not guilty, and not before. The prosecution contends further that, from what 
appears in the transcript, counsel has waived the right for postponement 
because, when asked whether he had any objection to the prosecution introducing 
its evidence, he answered: "Yes, Your Honor without prejudice to reserve our 
right to ask for the postponement for the presentation of the evidence for the 
defense." (2).</p>
<p align="justify">There cannot be any question that a petition or a motion for 
postponement of hearing can be filed before or after <i>arraignment</i>. The 
proper time for filing said petition or motion is not provided for in Section 7 
of Rule 114, which is only intended to guaranty that "after a plea of not 
guilty, * * * the defendant is entitled to at least two days to prepare for 
trial."</p>
<p align="justify">There is conflict of opinion as to whether defendants counsel 
made express waiver of his petition for postponement.</p>
<p align="justify">The majority had voted affirmatively. Although the majority 
vote appears to be supported by the wording of counsel's statement in the lower 
court, the writer's dissenting vote was cast on the ground that said statement 
should be interpreted jointly with the petition for postponement and the 
statements made by the court, the fiscal and the accused's counsel, made before 
and after the statements in question, and all said circumstances when considered 
make the waiver at least doubtful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">II</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in denying the petition of appellant for 
the voluntary inhibition of the trial judge who tried this case for the simple 
reason that they had already formed a biased opinion and therefore could not 
render an impartial judgment." (1).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Because of the fact that Judge Florentino Saguin one of the 
members of the trial court had sentenced appellant for murder based on the same 
facts as alleged in count number 4 of the information for treason, appellant's 
counsel moved for the voluntary inhibition of said judge to sit in this treason 
case, and now complains that his motion was denied.</p>
<p align="justify">The complaint is groundless. Counsel was not able to invoke any 
provision of law in support of his motion. As a matter of fact, there is none. 
The petition was addressed to the discretion of Judge Saguin, and Judge Saguin 
acted properly and wisely in sitting in this case.</p>
<p align="justify">It is not contended that Judge Saguin was disqualified under 
any specific provision of law. Consequently, it was his duty to take cognizance 
of a case. To take or not to take cognizance of a case, does not depend upon the 
discretion of a judge not legally disqualified to sit in a given case. It is his 
duty not to sit in its trial and decision if legally disqualified; but if the 
judge is not disqualified, it is a matter of official duty for him to proceed 
with the trial and decision of the case. He cannot shirk the responsibility 
without the risk of being called upon to account for his dereliction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">III</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in abusing too much his discretion and 
by assuming the role of the prosecution and converting our courts of justice 
into that of an inquisitorial tribunal." (1).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The reasons pointed out in appellants brief do not justify his 
complaint.</p>
<p align="justify">There is nothing on record to show that anyone of the judges of 
the trial court attempted to help the prosecution. The questions propounded by 
the judge, subject of appellant's complain, appeared to have been intended to 
elicit the truth from the witnesses. The inquisitiveness complained of by 
appellant's.counsel did not have the purpose of unduly harming the substantial 
rights of the accused. It was only to be expected from judges who, with full 
consciousness of their responsibilities, could not easily be satisfied with 
incompleteness and obscurities in the testimonies.</p>
<p align="justify">With regards to the resolution sustaining an objection which 
does not appear in the transcript to have been made, the prosecution believes 
that the transcript need not contain a complete account of what actually 
transpired.</p>
<p align="justify">Accepting that the lower court erred in this respect, appellant 
has not shown that the error had adversely affected him in a substantial manner. 
In the absence of such a showing, further discussion on the question is 
unnecessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">IV</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in admitting Exhibits A, B, and C." 
(1).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The admissibility of Exhibits A, B and C has been established 
by the testimony of Patrocinio Vda. de Biel, Mamerto de Leon and Ramon 
Camagay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">V</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in denying petition of appellant for an 
occular inspection of the place of Otto Galle." (1).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">There is not enough showing that the trial court erred in 
refusing defendant's request for an occular inspection of the Galle 
plantation.</p>
<p align="justify">Whether such an occular inspection should have been made or 
not, rested upon the discretion of the trial court. In the instant case there is 
no showing that the trial court committed a grave abuse of discretion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="center">VI</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in giving credit to the testimony of the 
witnesses for the prosecution and disregarded the testimony of the witnesses for 
the defense."</p>
<p align="center">VII</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in finding appellant herein guilty of 
the crime charged."</p>
<p align="center">VIII</p>
<p align="justify">"The trial court erred in holding appellant guilty and 
responsible for the crime of high treason cbmplexed with multiple murders, and 
in not acquitting him." (1).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">This court is fully satisfied that the findings of fact of the 
trial court are substantially supported by the evidence on record. This 
conclusion disposes of the appellant's contentions as to the last three alleged 
errors of the lower court. The appellant admitted that he is a Filipino 
citizen.</p>
<p align="justify">Upon the facts proved we find that appellant is guilty of the 
crime of treason as punished under Article 114 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>
<p align="justify">A majority voted for the affirmance of the appealed judgment, 
while there are minority members who voted that appellant be sentenced to 
<i>reclusion perpetua</i>. The writer, as a result of his position regarding the 
non-postponement of the trial in the lower court, voted to remand this case for 
a re-trial in the lower court. The final result is to modify the judgment.</p>
<p align="justify">Accordingly, appellant is sentenced to <i>reclusion 
perpetua</i> and to pay a fine of P10,000 and the costs. Under the ruling in 
People vs. Amansec (80 Phil., 424, 435) he is also ordered to pay an indemnity 
of P90,000 at the rate of P6,000 to the respective heirs of each one of the 
following fifteen persons: Otto Galle, Ines Galle, Eduardo del Rosario, Heddy 
del Rosario, Nene del Rosario, Fred del Rosario, maids Alejandra and Gregoria, 
Cristino Geronimo, Andres Fabian, Eulogio Biel, Dionisio Biel, Enrique Fargas, 
Agustin Nonial and Claro Nonial. With these modifications the appealed judgment 
is affirmed.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Paras, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and 
<i>Montemayor, JJ.</i>, concur.</p><p align="justify">Pablo, <i>M., </i>Voto por la confirmacion de la sentencia.</p><p align="justify">Tuason, <i>J.</i>, I vote for affirmance.</p>
<hr align="justify" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>CONCURRING</i></p>
<p align="justify">OZAETA, <i>J.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">This case was deliberated upon and voted on October 12, 1948; 
but as the decision will be promulgated during my absence, I desire to record 
now my vote for the affirmance of the death penalty imposed by the People's 
Court upon the appellant.</p></div>
