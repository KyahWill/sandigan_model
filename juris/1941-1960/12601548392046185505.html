				<BR><STRONG>LABRADOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Appeal from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Hon.
Gregorio S. Narvasa, presiding, declaring that an order of deportation
of petitioner Rosario Po to Hongkong on the first available
transportation is null and void and enjoining the Deportation Board
from enforcing it. The decision of the Court of First Instance was
rendered on a stipulation of facts, which, in part, reads as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p>"1.
That petitioner Rosario Po departed from Manila in 1940 for Shanghai
for the purpose of pursuing her studies thereat, carrying with her
Special Returning Certificate No. 45152 dated May 27, 1940;</p>
    <p>
"2. That when she came back to the Philippines on October 8, 1947, She
was documented and admitted to stay as a "temporary visitor', which
stay was extended several times by the respondent, the last of which
expired on April 18, 1949;</p>
    <p> "3. That upon her failure to
leave the country on said date, warrant of arrest No. 225 was issued
against the petitioner for violation of her stay in this country, and
deportation proceedings was instituted against her;</p>
    <p> "4.
That after due hearing, the Board of Commissioners promulgated its
decision on July 21, 1949, ordering the deportation of the petitioner
to Hongkong. A certified true copy of said decision is attached to the
Answer as Annex 'B', and is made an integral part hereof; </p>
    <p>"5.
That on July 27, 1949, petitioner filed a motion to reopen the
deportation proceedings to enable her to adduce evidence in support of
her petition for change of status, from temporary visitor to returning
resident;</p>
    <p> "6. That the Board of Commissioners in its
resolution dated July 30, 1949, denied the petitioner's motion and
pursuant thereto a warrant of deportation was issued on April 17, 1950.
A certified true copy each of the Board's resolution is attached to the
Answer as Annex 'C' and made an integral part hereof."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The stipulation further contains the following facts: On September 11,
1954, First Deputy Commissioner Francisco de la Rosa ordered the
correction of the status of Rosario Po <i>alias</i> Po Siu Eng from
temporary visitor to that of returning resident; that after giving
Rosario Po an opportunity to be heard, the Commissioner of Immigration
finally issued the following resolution:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"After
a careful consideration of the motion to reopen the above-entitled case
to present further evidence in support thereof for a change of status
from temporary visitor to returning Resident, this Board has arrived at
the conclusion that the same should be, as it is hereby, denied, on the
ground that under the present procedure in the issuance of immigration
visas, applicants must present themselves at the appropriate Consulates
abroad "for investigation and issuance of visas applied for."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Upon the above facts the court below declared that as Rosario Po was
provided with a special return certificate issued by the immigration
authorities when she returned on October 8, 1947, her admission as
temporary visitor when she came back on that said date was erroneous,
and that she should have been admitted as a returning resident, as her
failure to return back in 1946 on account of illness did not amount to
a relinquishment on her part of her intention to return. Wherefore, the
court declared the order of deportation null and void and prohibited
the Commissioner of Immigration from carrying it out.</p>
  <p>    Against the above  decision, the Commissioner of Immigration has appealed, assigning the following errors:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">      I </p>
    <p>THE LOWER  COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT  THE ADMISSION  OF PETITIONER-APPELLEE AS  TEMPORARY VISITOR WAS ERRONEOUS.</p>
    <p align="center"> II</p>
    <p>
THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DECLARING NULL AND VOID THE ACTION OF THE
RESPONDENT SETTING ASIDE THE ORDER OF THE FIRST DEPUTY COMMISSIONER
FRANCISCO DE LA ROSA OF SEPTEMBER 11, 1954 CHANGING THE STATUS OF THE
PETITIONER HEREIN FROM TEMPORARY VISITOR TO PERMANENT RESIDENT. </p>
    <p align="center">III</p>
    <p> THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GRANTING AND MAKING PERMANENT THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AS PRAYED FOR BY THE HEREIN PETITIONER.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
There is an express provision of law governing the case of
petitioner-appellee who is admittedly a resident but who entered into
the Philippines, after a departure therefrom for a length of time, as a
temporary visitor. This is Section 9(<i>g</i>) of Commonwealth Act No. 613, as amended by Section 3 of Republic  Act  No.  503, which provides:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Sec. 9. * * *.</p>
    <p>"(g)  * * *.</p>
    <p>"An
alien who is admitted as a nonimmigrant cannot remain in the
Philippines permanently. To obtain permanent admission, a nonimmigrant
alien must depart voluntarily to some foreign country and procure from
the appropriate Philippine consul the proper visa and thereafter
undergo examination by the officers of the Bureau of Immigration at a
Philippine port of entry for determination of his admissibility in
accordance with the requirements of this Act."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
When petitioner-appellee came back to the Philippines on October 8,
1947, after seven years' stay in Shanghai, she was documented and
admitted as a temporary visitor only. Her temporary permit was extended
several times by the Commissioner on Immigration, the last extension
having expired on April 18, 1949. From that time on she was an
overstaying temporary visitor. Admitting that she had formerly been a
permanent resident, when she returned back to the Philippines in 1947,
she should have procured from the Philippine Consulate in Hongkong or
any other foreign port where a Philippine Consul held office, for the
proper visa and, thereafter, she should have undergone an examination
by the Bureau of Immigration at a Philippine port of entry, these
proceedings being in accordance with the Immigration Bulletin No. 1,
which subsequently was sanctioned by and reiterated in practically the
same terms in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 503, which is quoted above.</p>
  <p>
The proceedings for admission of a temporary visitor are summary and no
proper documentation and examination to determine the visitor's
qualification to enter the Philippines are required. Evidently
petitioner-appellee wanted to avoid this rigorous examination and
documentation required of returning residents. The entry of
petitioner-appellee may be said to have been through the back door, for
it was without the proper documentation and examination required by the
rules, and said summary entry cannot be legalized by judicial action in
violation of the express provisions of the law. Returning residents may
not be considered above the law and courts of justice which are
supposed to be guardians of the law should not permit an alien's
circumvention of these requirements and convert their illegal entry
into a legal and valid one.</p>
  <p> It will be noted that this is
not the first case that has come to this Court. The same ruling has
been laid down by us in a number of decisions, the more recent of which
are the cases of Ong Se Lun, et al. <i>vs.</i> Board of  Immigration, 95 Phil., 785; Chiong Tiao Bing, et al. <i>vs.</i> Commissioner of Immigration,  99 Phil., 1020; 52  Off. Gaz.  (15) 6651;  Sy Hong, et al. <i>vs.</i> Commissioner of  Immigration, G. R. No. L-10224, May 11, 1957.</p>
  <p>
It is to be noted that no circumstances were shown in the case at bar
that would justify petitioner-appellee's return into the islands as a
temporary visitor in 1947, and following the ordinary procedure
established by the rules she should first be documented in a Philippine
Consulate abroad and later subjected to examination by the Immigration
authorities in accordance with the above decisions and the provisions
of the law above cited.</p>
  <p> Finding that the decision of the
court below is contrary to the provisions of the Immigration Act and
the decisions of this Court, we are constrained to reverse and set
aside said decision, and hereby declare that the order of the
Deportation Board for the deportation of petitioner-appellee Rosario Po
should be, as it hereby is, affirmed, with costs against
petitioner-appellee.</p>
