				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a <em>quo warranto</em> proceeding instituted by the Solicitor 
General against Honorable Domingo Imperial and Honorable Rodrigo Perez, to test 
the legality of their continuance in office as Chairman and Member, 
respectively, of the Commission on Elections.
<p>According to the Solicitor General, the first commissioners of Elections were 
duly appointed and qualified on July 12, 1945, with the following terms of 
office:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hon, Jose Lopez Vito, Chairman, for 9 years, expiring on July 12, 1954</p>
<p>Hon. Francisco Enage, Member, for 6 years, expiring on July 12, 1951</p>
<p>Hon. Vicente Vera, Member, for 3 years, expiring on July 12, 
1948;</p></blockquote>
<p>that upon the death of Chairman Jose Lopez Vito in May, 1947, Member Vicente 
de Vera was promoted Chairman by appointment dated May 26, 1947; that in 
accordance with the ruling of this Court in Nacionalista Party <em>vs</em>. 
Vera, 47 Off. Gaz., 2375, and Nacionalista Party <em>vs</em>. Felix Angelo 
Bautista, 47 Off. Gaz., 2356, the term of office of Chairman De Vera would have 
expired on July 12, 1954, that is, the date when the term of office of the first 
Chairman, Honorable Jose Lopez Vito, would have expired; that Chairman Vicente 
de Vera died in August, 1951, before the expiration of the maximum term of nine 
years (on July 12, 1954) of the first Chairman of the Commission; that on August 
11, 1951, the respondent Honorable Domingo Imperial was appointed Chairman to 
succeed Honorable Vicente de Vera; that while the appointment of the respondent 
Honorable Imperial provided that he was to serve "for a term expiring July 12, 
1960", the term for which he could legally serve as Chairman legally expired on 
July 12, 1954, that is, the expiration of the nine-year term for which the first 
Chairman, Honorable Jose Lopez Vito, was appointed; that the respondent 
Honorable Rodrigo Perez was appointed Member of the Commission on December 8, 
1949, for "a term of nine years expiring on November 24, 1958", vice Honorable 
Francisco Enage, who was retired on November, 1949; that the term of office of 
respondent Perez legally expired on July 12, 1951, the expiration of the term of 
six years for which Commissioner Enage, his predecessor, was appointed. 
Wherefore, the Solicitor General concludes that the respondents Commissioners 
Imperial and Perez have ceased to have any legal or valid title to the positions 
of Chairman and Member, respectively, of the Commission on Elections, and that 
therefore, their positions should be declared vacant.</p>
<p>The respondents filed separate answer to the petition for <em>quo 
warranto</em>, both of which pray for the dismissal of the petition.</p>
<p>The defense of respondent Honorable Domingo Imperial is substantially that 
Honorable Jose Lopez Vito was first appointed Chairman of the Commission on 
Elections on May 12, 1941, for a term of nine years expiring on May 12, 1950; 
that when Commissioner Lopez Vito was again appointed Chairman on July 12, 1945, 
his nine-year, term of office under this second appointment should not be 
reckoned from the date thereof, that is, July 12, 1945, but from the date of his 
first appointment in 1941, so that the term under his second appointment expired 
on May 12, 1950; that respondent Imperial having been appointed after the 
expiration of Chairman Lopez Vito's full term of nine years in 1950, he 
(respondent Imperial) should serve office for a full term of nine years, ending 
only on August 10, 1960. Respondent Imperial stresses the unconstitutional^ of 
Chairman Lopez Vito's second appointment to serve up to July 12, 1954, upon the 
ground that under the Constitution, he (Chairman Lopez Vito) could neither be 
appointed for more than nine years nor be allowed to succeed himself.</p>
<p>The other respondent, Honorable Rodrigo Perez, alleges that since Chairman 
Lopez Vito was the first to be appointed under the Constitution on May 13, 1941, 
the terms of office of all the Commissioners on Election should be reckoned from 
that date, May 13, 1941, to maintain the three-year difference between the dates 
of expiration of their respective terms as provided for by the Constitution; 
that the term of office of Member Francisco Enage (his predecessor) should 
therefore be considered as having started on May 13, 1941, and since Enage was 
appointed only for six years, his term of office expired on May 12, 1947; and 
that since respondent Perez was appointed (on December 8,1949) after 
Commissioner Enage's six-year term of office had already expired, he should 
serve for a full term of nine years from the expiration of Enage's term of 
office on May 12, 1947; hence, his own term of office would expire only on May 
12, 1956. Respondent Perez argues that if the computation of the Solicitor 
General were to be followed, that is, that Commissioner Enage's term be counted 
from July 12, 1945 ending on July 12, 1951, this term would end at a date very 
close to the expiration of Commissioner Lopez Vito's term on May 12, 1950, so 
there would be only a difference of fourteen months between the expiration of 
the terms of office of Commissioners Lopez Vito and Enage, a situation which is 
contrary to and violative of the Constitution that prescribes a difference of 
three years between the dates of the expiration of the terms of the Members of 
the Commission.</p>
<p>The issues now posed demand a re-examination and application of the 
Constitutional amendment establishing an independent Commission on Elections 
(Article X) that became operative on December 2, 1940, superseding the purely 
statutory Commission previously created and organized along the same lines by 
Commonwealth Act No. 607. While this Court already had occasion to make 
pronouncements on the matter in previous decisions, the same are not considered 
decisive in view of the divergence of opinions among the members of the Court at 
the time said decisions were rendered.</p>
<p>Section 1, paragraph 1, of Article X of the Constitution reads as 
follows;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 1. There shall be an independent Commission on Elections composed of a 
Chairman and two other Members to be appointed by the President with the consent 
of the Commission on Appointments, who shall hold office for a term of nine 
years and may not be reappointed. Of the Members of the Commission first 
appointed, one shall hold office for nine years, another for six years, and the 
third for three yearg. The Chairman and the other Members of the Commission on 
Elections may be removed from office only by impeachment in the manner provided 
in this Constitution." .</p></blockquote>
<p>The provision that of the first three commissioners appointed, "one shall 
hold office for 9 years, another for 6 years, and the third for 3 years," when 
taken together with the prescribed term of office for 9 years, without 
reappointment, evidences a deliberate plan to have a regular rotation or cycle 
in the membership of the commission, by having subsequent members appojntable 
only once every three years. This had already been indicated in previous 
opinions of this Court (Nacionalista Party <em>vs</em>. Angelo Bautista,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 47 Off. Gaz., 2356; Nacionalista Party 
<em>vs</em>. Vera,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 47 Off. Gaz., 
2375), where it was declared that "with these periods it was the intention to 
have one position vacant every three years, so that no President can appoint 
more than one Commissioner, thereby preserving and safeguarding the independence 
and impartiality of the Commission" as a body, we may add, for the impartiality 
and independence of each individual Commissioner's tenure was safeguarded by 
other provisions in the same Article X of the fundamental charter (removability 
by impeachment alone, and stability of compensation in sec. 1; disability to 
practice any profession and prohibition of conflicting interest in sec. 3).</p>
<p>That the rotation of the Commissioner's appointments at regular and fixed 
intervals of three years was a deliberate plan is shown by the history of the 
provision, and by selection of the fixed term of nine years for all subsequent 
appointees, since no other term would give such a result. Initiated under 
Commonwealth Act No. 607, the rotation plan was transferred without variation to 
the Constitution, evidently for the purpose of preserving it from hasty and 
irreflexive changes.</p>
<p>Now, the operation of the rotational plan requires two conditions, both 
indispensable to its workability: (1) that the terms of the first three 
commissioners should <em>start on a common date</em>; and (2) that any vacancy 
due to death, resignation or disability before the expiration of the term should 
only be filled only <em>for the unexpired balance of the term</em>. Without 
satisfying these conditions, the regularity of the intervals between 
appointments would be destroyed, and the evident purpose of the rotation (to 
prevent that a four-year administration should appoint more than one permanent 
and regular commissioner) would be frustrated.</p>
<p>While the general rule is that a public officer's death or other permanent 
disability creates a vacancy <em>in the office</em>, so that the successor is 
entitled to hold for a full term, such rule is recognized to suffer exception in 
those cases where the clear intention is to have vacancies ap- pointments at 
regular intervals. Thus, in 43 Amer. prudence, sec. 159, p. 18, it is 
stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * In like manner, it has been ruled that the resignation or the removal 
of an officer during his term and the election or appointment of a successor do 
not divide the term or create a new and distinct one, and that in such a case 
the successor is filling out his predecessor's term. It seems the term of office 
of one elected or appointed to fill a vacancy in a board of several officers 
will be held to be <em>for the unexpired term</em> of his predecessor 
<em>only</em>, where the <em>clear intent</em> of the creating power is that the 
<em>entire board should not go out of office at once</em>, but that 
<em>different</em> groups should retire at regularly recurring intervals." 
(Italics supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p>In State ex rel. Rylands <em>vs</em>. Pinkerman, 63 Conn. 176, 28 Atl. 110, 
22 LRA 643, the Court, discussing provisions in the charter of the city of 
Bridgeport requiring two city Commissioners to serve for 2 years, and another 
two to serve for 4 years, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The evident intent of section 50 is to secure to the city at all 
times, so far as possible, the services of commissioners, half of whom have had 
the benefit of at least a year's experience in office, and to divide the 
membership of each half equally between the leading political parties. 
<em>Parmater vs. State</em>, 102 Ind. 90, 93. Such a board had existed in 
Bridgeport since 1868. The charter of that year provided for the election of two 
commissioners to serve for one year, and two for two years, and for the annual 
election thereafter of two to serve for two years, and secured a nonpartisan 
character to the board by allowing no one to vote for more than two out of the 
four, and requiring the election of deputy commissioners to replace each elected 
commissioner in case of a vacancy. From that time until the resignation of the 
entire board, in December, 1890, its membership had been annually renewed by the 
appointment of two commissioners for a term of two years, each belonging to a 
different political party from the other. Were the contention of the defendant 
well founded, the successors of the four commissioners who resigned in December, 
1890, should have been, and in law were, appointed each for two-year term, thus 
totally and forever frustrating the carefully devised scheme of alternating 
succession which had been followed for twenty years." (Cas. Cit., 22 LRA, 669) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The following cases also support the rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the Constitution fixes the duration of a term of office, and at the 
same time provides for its being filled at a fixed time occurring periodically, 
it necessarily follows that, a casual vacancy occurring during such term of 
office, necessity must arise for filling it for the unexpired term; and although 
the mode of filling such vacancy is prescribed by the Constitutional, yet the 
incumbent only holds until the time arrives for filling the office in the 
regular mode and at the regular time prescribed by the Constitution." (Simpson 
<em>vs</em>. Willard, 14 S. C. 191).</p>
<p>And in Baker <em>vs</em>. Kirk, 33 Ind. 517, it was held that the term of 
office of one appointed to fill a vacancy in one of three memberships of &amp; 
board will, in the absence of any express provision therefore, be deemed to be 
for the unexpired term, where the statute fixes the first term at unequal 
lengths, so as to prevent an entire change of membership at any one time. In 
speaking of the reasoning to the contrary, the court said: "It would make the 
term of office to depend Upon the pleasure or caprice of the incumbent, and not 
upon the will of the legislature as expressed in plain and undoubted language in 
the law. This construction would defeat the true intent and meaning of the 
legislature, 50 LRA. (N. S.), which was to prevent an entire change of the board 
of directors of the prison."</p></blockquote>
<p>Other cases to the same effect are collated in the editorial note in State 
Ex. Rel. Fish vs. Howell, 50 L. R. A. (N. S.), 345.</p>
<p>The fact that the orderly rotation and renovation of Commissioners would be 
wrecked unless, in case of early vacancy, a successor should only be allowed to 
serve for the unexpired portion of each regular term, sufficiently explains why 
no express provision to that effect is made in Article X of the Constitution. 
The rule is so evidently fundamental and indispensable to the working of the 
plan that it became unnecessary to state it in so many words. The mere fact that 
such appointments would make the appointees serve for less than 9 years does not 
argue against reading such limitation into the constitution, because the 
nine-year term cannot be lifted out of context and independently of the 
provision limiting the terms of the terms of the first commissioners to nine, 
six and three years; and because in any event, the unexpired portion is still 
part and parcel of the preceding term, so that in filling the vacancy, only the 
tenure of the successor is shortened, but not the term of office.</p>
<p>It may be that the appointing power has sufficient inducements at hand to 
create vacancies in the Commission, and find occasion for appointments thereto, 
whenever it chooses to do so. That possibility, however, would not in any way 
justify this Court in setting at naught the clear intention of the Constitution 
to have members of Commission appointed at regular 3-year intervals.</p>
<p>It is argued that under the rule, one may be appointed for a much shorter 
term than nine years, say one year or even less, and his independence would be 
thereby reduced. The point is, however, that the majority of the Commission 
would not be affected (save in really exceptional cases) and independence of the 
<em>majority</em> is the independence of the whole Commission.</p>
<p>For the same reasons it must be admitted that the terms of the first three 
Commissioners should be held to have started at the same moment, irrespective of 
the variations in their dates of appointment and qualification, in order that 
the expiration of the first terms of nine, six and three years should lead to 
the regular recurrence of the three-year intervals between the expiration of the 
terms. Otherwise, the fulfillment and success of the carefully devised 
constitutional scheme would be made to depend upon the willingness of the 
appointing power to conform thereto.</p>
<p>It would be really immaterial whether the terms of the first Commissioners 
appointed under the Constitutional provision should be held to start from the 
approval of the constitutional amendment (December 2, 1940), the reorganization 
of the Commission under C. A. 657, on June 21, 1941, or from the appointment of 
the first Chairman, Honorable Jose Lopez Vito, on May 13, 1941. The point to be 
emphasized is that the terms of all three Commissioners appointed under the 
Constitution began at the same instant and that, in case of a belated 
appointment (like that of Commissioner Enage), the interval between the start of 
the term and the actual qualification of the appointee must be counted against 
the latter. No other rule could satisfy the constitutional plan.</p>
<p>Of the three starting dates given above, we incline to prefer that of the 
organization of the constitutional Commission on Elections under Commonwealth 
Act 657, on June 21, 1941, since said act implemented and completed the 
organization of the Commission that under the Constitution "shall be" 
established. Certainly the terms can not begin from the first appointments, 
because appointment to a Constitution office is not only a right, but equally a 
duty that should not be shirked or delayed. On the basic tenets of our 
democratic institutions, it can hardly be conceded that the appointing power 
should possess discretion to retard compliance with its constitutional duty to 
appoint when delay would impede or frustrate the plain intent of the fundamental 
law. Ordinarily, the operation of the Constitution can not be made to depend 
upon the Legislature or the Executive, but in the present case the generality of 
the organizational lines under Article X seems to envisage prospective 
implementation.</p>
<p>Applying the foregoing rulings to the case at bar, we find that the terms of 
office of the first appointees under the constitution should be computed as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hon. Jose Lopez Vito, Chairman, nine-year term, from June 21, 1941 to June 
20, 1950.</p>
<p>Hon. Francisco Enage, Member, six year term, from June 21, 1941 to June 20, 
1947.</p>
<p>The first 3 year term, from June 21, 1941 to June 20, 1944, was not 
filled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thereafter, since the first three-year term had already expired, the 
appointment (made on July 12, 1945) of the Honorable Vicente de Vera must be 
deemed for the full term of nine years, from June 21, 1944, to June 20, 
1953.</p>
<p>The first vacancy occurred by expiration of the initial 6-year term of 
Commissioner Enage on June 21, 1937 (although he served as <em>de facto</em> 
Commissioner until 1949). His successor, respondent Rodrigo Perez, was named for 
a full nine-year term. However, on the principles heretofore laid, the nine-year 
term of Commissioner Perez (vice Enage) should be held to have started in June 
21, 1947, to expire on June 20, 1956.</p>
<p>The second vacancy happened upon the death of Chairman Jose Lopez Vito, who 
died on May 7, 1947, more than two years before the expiration of his full term. 
To succeed him as Chairman, Commissioner Vicente de Vera was appointed. Such 
appointment, if at all valid, could legally be only for the unexpired period of 
the Lopez Vito's term, up to June 20, 1950.</p>
<p>To fill the vacancy created by Vera's assumption of the Chairmanship, 
Commissioner Leopoldo Rovira was appointed on May 22, 1947. Pursuant to the 
principles laid down, Rovira could only fill out the balance of Vera's term, 
until June 20, 1953, and could not be reappointed thereafter.</p>
<p>Commissioner Vera's tenure as Chairman (vice Lopez Vito) expired, as we have 
stated, on June 20, 1950, the end of Lopez Vito's original term. A vacancy, 
therefore, occurred on that date that Vera could no longer fill, since his 
reappointment was expressly prohibited by the Constitution. The next Chairman 
was respondent Commissioner Domingo Imperial, whose term of nine years must be 
deemed to have begun on June 21, 1950, to expire on June 20, 1959.</p>
<p>The vacancy created by the legal expiration of Rovira's term on June 20, 1953 
appears unfilled up to the present. The time elapsed, as we have held, must be 
counted against his successor, whose legal term is for nine years, from June 21, 
1953 to June 20, 1962.</p>
<p>The fact must be admitted that appointments have heretofore been made with 
little regard for the Constitutional plan. However, if the principles set in 
this decision are observed, no difficulty need be anticipated for the 
future.</p>
<p>And it appearing, from the foregoing, that the legal terms of office of the 
respondents Perez and Imperial have not as yet expired, whether the original 
terms started from the operation of the Constitutional amendments or the 
enactment of C. A. 657, the petition for <em>quo warranto</em> is hereby 
dismissed without costs.</p>

<p><strong>PADILLA, J.</strong>, <em>concurring and dissenting</em>:</p>
<p>I agree to the opinion of Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes except as to the 
prohibition on reappointment. I believe the prohibition applies only to those 
who have served a term of nine years.</p>
<p><strong>BAUTISTA ANGELO, J.</strong>, <em>dissenting and concurring</em>:</p>
<p>This case concerns the interpretation of the provision of the Constitution 
regarding the tenure of office of the members of the Commission on Elections who 
are appointed to succeed those first appointed in case they resign, retire, or 
die before the expiration of their term of office. The majority holds that the 
appointees can hold office only for the unexpired term even if their 
appointments run for a full term of nine years. With this I disagree. The 
pertinent provision of the Constitution is contained in section 1, Article X, 
which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Section 1. There shall be an independent Commission on Elections composed of 
a Chairman and two other Members to be appointed by the President with the 
consent of the Commission on Appointments, who shall hold office for a term of 
nine years and may not be reappointed. Of the Members of the Commission first 
appointed, one shall hold office for nine years, another for six years, and the 
third for three years. The Chairman and the other Members of the Commission on 
Elections may be removed from office only by impeachment in the manner provided 
in this Constitution." </p></blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the framers of the Constitution intended to give to the 
members of the Commission on Elections a term of office of nine years without 
reappointment. The only exception is with regard to the first appointees one of 
whom shall hold office for nine years, another for six years, and the third for 
three years. With regard to the latter, nothing is provided as to their 
reappointment which led some members of the Court to believe that they can be 
reappointed provided the whole tenure would not exceed nine years. The 
Constitution is likewise silent as to the manner any vacancy that may occur in 
the positions held by the members first appointed should be filled.</p>
<p>I fully agree with the theory that the purpose of providing for a difference 
of three years in the tenure of office of the members first appointed is to 
establish a cycle or rotation system to prevent a four-year administration from 
appointing more than one member not only to insure the continuity of the policy 
of the Commission on Elections but also to safeguard its independence and that 
of its members. This purpose is plausible if only it can be carried out to the 
letter, but experience has shown that it is impracticable and has never been 
observed either by the Chief Executive or by Congress. An analysis of the 
appointments heretofore made to fill vacancies in the membership of said 
Commission will bear this out. The Chief Executive in filling the vacancies in 
the positions held by the members first appointed have extended appointments for 
a term of nine years never for the unexpired period, and these appointments have 
always met the sanction of Congress.</p>
<p>This uninterrupted practice and contemporaneous construction placed on the 
above provision of the Constitution by the two branches of our Government, the 
executive and the legislative, cannot lightly be brushed aside because they are 
the constitutional agencies which have adopted that amendment to the 
Constitution and have implemented it having due regard for its provision of 
events. And such interpretation should be given due weight and recognition if we 
are to accord due respect to the principle of comity that should exists among 
the three branches of the Government</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This official ruling of the executive officials is now entitled to 
consideration by the courts. Courts will and should respect the contemporaneous 
construction placed upon a statute by the executive officers whose duty it is to 
enforce it, and unless such interpretation is clearly erroneous will ordinarily 
be controlled thereby. (In re Allen (1903), 2 Phil., 630, following Penneyer 
<em>vs</em>. McConnaughy (1890), 140 U. S. 363, Government of Philippine Islands 
Ex. Rel. Municipality of Cardona <em>vs</em>. Municipality of Binangonan (1916), 
34 Phil., 518)." (Molina <em>vs</em>. Rafferty, 37 Phil., 545, 555).</p>
<p>"At the same time, the contemporaneous construction of the law by two 
departments of the Government—one of the legislative branch responsible for its 
enactment, and the other the effective branch responsible for its 
enforcement—while not controlling on the Judiciary, is entitled to our 
respectful consideration. For the orderly and harmonious interpretation and 
advancement of the law, the courts should, when possible, keep step with the 
other departments." (Yra <em>vs</em>. Abano, 52 Phil., 380, 384.)</p>
<p>"And it is a rule repeatedly followed by this court that the construction 
placed upon a law at a time by the officials in charge of enforcing it should be 
respected." (Guanio <em>vs</em>. Fernandez, 55 Phil., 814, 
819.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The above interpretation seems to be the most reasonable and more in line 
with the letter and spirit of the Constitution. The purpose is to establish "an 
independent Commission on Elections" and it was thought the best way it could be 
accomplished is to give to its members a term of office of nine (9) years in the 
hope that this would give them that feeling of security which would make them 
impartial in the performance of their functions. The provision regarding the 
cycle or rotation system in the appointments of the members first appointed is a 
further safeguard to promote such independence but if that cycle cannot be 
maintained because of unavoidable human factors that may supervene, that should 
not be allowed to stand against the above purpose of giving to every subsequent 
appointee a term of office of nine (9) years. The former should give way to the 
latter.</p>
<p>The theory that, merely to maintain the cycle at any cost, if a vacancy 
occurs in the office of the members first appointed, the new appointee can only 
be appointed for the unexpired term, would defeat the independence of the poll 
body rather than promote it, for the new appointees would be holding their 
positions without that feeling of security that would guarantee their 
independence as they would be angling for a reappointment or for other plums in 
the government service. Moreover, such interpretation would run counter to the 
well-known rule that where only the length of the term is fixed by the 
Constitution and neither the commencement nor termination is prescribed, or 
nothing is provided regarding the filling of the unexpired term, the subsequent 
appointee holds the office for full term, and not merely f6r the unexpired 
portion. And our Constitution comes within the purview of this rule.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When merely the length of the term is fixed, without reference to an 
unexpired term, or to a vacancy in the term of office, as distinguished from a 
vacancy in the office itself, it is held in some cases that on the happening of 
a vacancy the office reverts to the people or sovereign and when again vested it 
is not for the unexpired term, but for the full term. This rule, in the absence 
of constitutional or statutory provisions regulating the filling of vacancies, 
has been applied in the case of elective officers where the law provides that 
they shall be elected for a term of a specified number of years." (67 C. J. S.( 
216.)</p>
<p>"On the other hand where no time is fixed for the beginning or end of the 
period during which a public office is to be occupied, and the duration of such 
period is alone designated, the contrary conclusion is reached, and a person 
selected to fill a vacancy in such office may serve the full term and not merely 
the unexpired balance of the prior incumbent's term. This is true especially 
where no authority exists in the legislature for fixing the beginning or the 
ending of the term, or where such authority rests in the legislature, and the 
legislature has not exercised it. The reason for this rule is that when a 
vacancy happens by death, resignation, or removal, the term is gone and the 
office reverts, as it did at common law to the crown, to be again filled on like 
condition, for the full term prescribed." (22 R. C. L., 553)</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it that the Constitution does not contain any provision relative to 
the filling of any vacancy in the office held by the members first appointed? 
The answer is simple: the first sentence of section 1, Article X already 
provides that future appointments should be made for a term of nine (9) years. 
If the intention were other- wise, the framers of the Constitution would have 
inserted therein a proviso similar to that covering vacancies in the office of 
senators or representatives wherein it was clearly directed that the new 
incumbent shall only serve for the unexpired term (Section 8, (2) Article VI, 
Constitution).</p>
<p>If this theory is entertained it follows that respondent Domingo Imperial, 
who was appointed on August 11, 1951 for a term of nine (9) years ending on July 
12, 1960, and respondent Rodrigo D. Perez who was appointed on November 8, 1949, 
for a term of nine (9) years ending on November 24, 1958, are still entitled to 
their positions, and, therefore, the present petition for quo warranto should be 
dismissed. As this is the conclusion reached by the majority opinion, I concur 
in the result</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J.</em>, and <em>Reyes, A., J.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Petition dismissed.</em></p></div>
