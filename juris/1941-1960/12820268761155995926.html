				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition to set aside all the proceedings had in Civil Case No. 381 
of the Court of First Instance of Leyte and to enjoin the respondent judge from 
further acting upon the same. 
<p><em>Facts: </em>1. On May 26, 1947, the petitioners C. Arnold Hall and 
Bradley P. Hall, and the respondents Fred Brown, Emma Brown, Hipolita D. Chapman 
and Ceferino S. Abella, signed and acknowledged in Leyte, the articles of 
incorporation of the Far Eastern Lumber and Commercial Co., Inc., organized to 
engage in a general lumber business, to carry on as general contractors, 
operators and managers, etc. Attached to the articles was an affidavit of the 
treasurer stating that 23,428 shares of stock had been subscribed and fully paid 
with certain properties transferred to the corporation described in a list 
appended thereto.</p>
<p>(2) Immediately after the execution of said articles of incorporation, the 
corporation proceeded to do business with the adoption of by-laws and the 
election of its officers.</p>
<p>(3) On December 2, 1947, the said articles were filed in the office of the 
Securities and Exchange Commissioner, for the issuance of the corresponding 
certificate of incorporation.</p>
<p>(4) On March 22, 194&amp;, pending action on the articles of incorporation by 
the aforesaid governmental office, the respondents Fred Brown, Emma Brown, 
Hipolita D. Chapman and Ceferino S. Abella filed before the Court of First 
Instance of Leyte the civil case numbered 381, entitled "Fred Brown et al., vs. 
Arnold C. Hall et al.", alleging among other things that the Far Eastern Lumber 
and Commercial Co. was an unregistered partnership; that they wished to have it 
dissolved because of bitter dissension among the members, mismanagement and 
fraud by the managers and heavy financial losses.</p>
<p>(5) The defendants in the suit, namely, C. Arnold Hall and Bradley P. Hall, 
filed a motion to dismiss, contesting the court's jurisdiction and the 
sufficiency of the cause of action.</p>
<p>(6) After hearing the parties, the Hon. Edmundo S. Piccio ordered the 
dissolution of the company; and at the request of plaintiffs, appointed the 
respondent Pedro A. Capuciong as receiver of the properties thereof, upon the 
filing of a twenty-thousand-peso bond.</p>
<p>(7) The defendants therein (petitioners herein) offered to file a 
counter-bond for the discharge of the receiver. But the respondent judge refused 
to accept the offer and to discharge the receiver. Whereupon the present special 
civil action was instituted in this court. It is based upon two main 
propositions, to wit:</p>
<p>(<em>a</em>) The court had no jurisdiction in civil case No. 381 to decree 
the dissolution of the company, because it being a <em>de facto</em> 
corporation, dissolution thereof may only be ordered in a <em>quo warranto</em> 
proceeding instituted in accordance with Section 19 of the Corporation Law.</p>
<p>(<em>b</em>) Inasmuch as respondents Fred Brown and Emma Brown had signed the 
articles of incorporation, they are estopped from claiming that it is not a 
corporation but only a partnership.</p>
<p><em>Discussion:</em> The second proposition may at once be dismissed. All the 
parties are informed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has not, so 
far, issued the corresponding certificate of incorporation. All of them know, or 
ought to know, that the personality of a corporation begins to exist only from 
the moment such certificate is issued — not before (Sec. 11, Corporation Law). 
The complaining associates have not represented to the others that they were 
incorporated any more than the latter had made similar representations to them. 
And as nobody was led to believe anything to his prejudice and damage, the 
principle of estoppel does not apply. Obviously this is not an instance 
requiring the enforcement of contracts <em>with the corporation</em> through the 
rule of estoppel.</p>
<p>The first proposition above stated is premised on the theory that, inasmuch 
as the Far Eastern Lumber and Commercial Co. is a <em>de facto</em> corporation, 
section 19 of the Corporation Law applies, and therefore the court had no 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of said civil case number 381. Section 19 reads 
in part as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * The due incorporation of any corporation claiming in good faith to be 
a corporation under this Act and its right to exercise corporate powers shall 
not be inquired into collaterally in any private suit to which the corporation 
may be a party, but such inquiry may be had at the suit of the Insular 
Government on information of the Attorney-General.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are at least two reasons why this section does not govern the 
situation. Not having obtained the certificate of incorporation, the Far Eastern 
Lumber and Commercial Co.—even its stockholders—may not probably claim "in good 
faith" to be a corporation.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Under our statute it is to be noted (Corporation Law, Sec. 11) that it is 
the issuance of a certificate of incorporation by the Director of the Bureau of 
Commerce and Industry which calls a corporation into being. The immunity to 
collateral attack is granted to corporations 'claiming in good faith to be a 
corporation under this act.' Such a claim is compatible with the existence 
of.errors and irregularities; but not with a total or substantial disregard of 
the law. Unless there has been an evident attempt to comply with the law the 
claim to be a corporation 'under this Act' could not be made 'in good faith.' " 
(Fisher on The Philippine Law of Stock Corporations, p. 75. <em>See also</em> 
Humphreys <em>vs</em>. Drew, 59 Fla. 295, 52 So. 362.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, this is not a suit in which <em>the corporation</em> is a party. This 
is a litigation between stockholders of the alleged corporation, for the purpose 
of obtaining its dissolution. Even the existence of a <em>de jure</em> 
corporation may be terminated in a private suit for its dissolution between 
stockholders, without the intervention of the state.</p>
<p>There might be room for argument on the right of minority stockholders to sue 
for dissolution;<span class="style1"><sup>[1]</sup></span> but that question does 
not affect the court's jurisdiction, and is a matter for decision by the judge, 
subject to review on appeal. Which brings us to one principal reason why this 
petition may not prosper, namely: the petitioners have their remedy by appealing 
the order of dissolution at the proper time.</p>
<p>There is a secondary issue in connection with the appointment of a receiver. 
But it must be admitted that receivership is proper in proceedings for 
dissolution of a company or corporation, and it was no error to reject the 
counter-bond, the court having decreed the dissolution. As to the amount of the 
bond to be demanded of the receiver, much depends upon the discretion of the 
trial court, which in this instance we do not believe has been clearly 
abused.</p>
<p><em>Judgment:</em> The petition will, therefore, be dismissed, with costs. 
The preliminary injunction heretofore issued will be dissolved.</p><i>Ozaeta,
