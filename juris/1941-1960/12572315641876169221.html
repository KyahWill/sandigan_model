				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On June 29, 1957, a petition to probate the alleged last will and
testament of Jose J. Javellana, who died on May 24 of the same year,
was presented in the Court of First Instance of Rizal by Cristeta
Jimenea Vda. de Javellana and Benjamin Javellana, widow and brother
respectively of the deceased, alleging that the aforesaid Jose J.
Javellana, at the time of his death, a resident of San Juan, Rizal,
left properties with an approximate value of P400,000.00 ; that he also
left a will which was delivered to the clerk of court pursuant to the
Rules of Court; that Oscar Ledesma, therein named executor, had agreed
to act as such; that the decedent's next of kin were: the widow,
Cristeta J. Vda. de Javellana, his children—Erlinda Javellana, Jose
Javellana y Azaola, and Jose Javellana, Jr. (Pepito), his sister
Juanita J. de Ledesma, and brother Benjamin Javellana, whose respective
addresses were given in the petition.<p></p>
<p>To this petition, Jose Javellana y Azaola and Jose Javellana, Jr.
(Pepito) filed separate oppositions, both claiming that the alleged
will of Jose J. Javellana deposited by petitioners with the clerk of
court was null and void, the same not having been executed "in
accordance with the formalities required by law" and that "the legal
requirements necessary for its validity" had not been complied with.</p>
<p>At the hearing, petitioners introduced as evidence in support of the
petition, a copy of the will; certification of the date and cause of
death of the testator; proof of publication of the petition, once a
week for 3 consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation,
and the testimonies of Jose G. Guevarra, Eloisa Villanueva and Jose
Yulo, Jr., the 3 instrumental witnesses to the will, who, in substance,
testified that sometime in April, 1956i they were asked to witness the
execution of the will of the late Jose J. Javellana; that on the said
occasion, Jose J. Javellana signed the 4 pages of the will in their
presence, and they, in turn, also signed each and every page thereof in
the presence of the testator and of one another; and that these acts
were acknowledged before notary public Fernando Grey, Jr. on the same
occasion.</p>
<p>For their part, the oppositors limited their evidence to the
presentation of two letters in the Visayan dialect allegedly written by
the deceased, the signatures appearing thereon being identified by Jose
Javellana, Jr. (Pepito) and Manuel Azaola, as those of the deceased,
for the sole purpose of comparing said signatures with those appearing
in the will.</p>
<p>On December 10, 1957, the court <em>a quo</em> issued an order
allowing the probate of the win and directing the issuance of letters
testamentary to Oscar Ledesma as executor thereof, upon the latter's
filing a bond in the sum of IM.0,000.00. From this order, oppositors
appealed to this Court charging the lower court of committing error in
allowing probate of the will, Exhibit C, on 2 grounds: (1) that the 3
attesting witnesses failed to clearly and convincingly establish the
due execution of the will; and (2) that petitioners failed to prove
that the will was written in a language known to the testator.</p>
<p>The first basis of oppositors' appeal has no merit. It is true that
the witnesses, particularly Miss Eloisa Villanueva, apparently found
difficulty recalling who arrived first at the appointed place, or the
order of the witnesses' signing the will, or failed to mention by name
the persons present at the time one of the witnesses was signing the
document. These details, however, are minor and insignificant and do
not enervate their positive testimony that at the execution of the
will, the testator, the 3 witnesses, the notary public and Atty.
Vicente Hilado were all together in the private office of the latter;
that Jose Guevarra, Eloisa Villanueva and Jose Yulo, Jr., the
instrumental witnesses, were unanimous in declaring that they actually
saw the testator sign the will as well as each and every page thereof,
and they, in turn, affixed their signatures to all of its 4 pages. For
the purpose of determining the due execution of a will, it is not
necessary that the instrumental witnesses should give an accurate and
detailed account of the proceeding, such as recalling the order of the
signing of the document by the said witnesses. It is sufficient that
they have seen or at least were so situated at the moment that they
could have seen each other sign, had they wanted to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
In fact, in the instant case, at least two witnesses, Yulo and
Guevarra, both testified that the testator and the 3 witnesses signed
in the presence of each and every one of them.</p>
<p>With respect to the second ground, there is some merit in
appellant's contention that the language requirement of the law on
wills has not been satisfactorily complied with in this case.
Admittedly, there is want of expression in the body of the will itself
or in its attestation clause that the testator knew Spanish, the
language in which it is written. It is true that there is no statutory
provision requiring this and that proof thereof may be established by
evidence <em>aliunde</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
But here, there is absolutely no such evidence presented by the
petitioners-appellees. Not even the petition for probate contains any
allegation to this effect. No reference to it whatsoever is made in the
appealed order.</p>
<p>In some cases, it is true, this lack of evidence was considered
cured by presumption of knowledge of the language or dialect used in
the will, as where the will is executed in a certain province or
locality, in the dialect currently used in such province or locality in
which the testator is a native or resident, the presumption arises that
the testator knew the dialect so used, in the absence of evidence to
the contrary;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> or where the
will is in Spanish, the fact that the testatrix was a "mestiza
española", was married to a Spaniard, made several trips to Spain, and
some of her letters in her own handwriting submitted as evidence by the
oppositor, are in Spanish, give rise to the presumption that she knew
the language in which the will was written, in the absence of proof to
the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>In the case before us, no such or similar circumstances exist. On
the contrary, there is evidence that the testator is a Visayan although
residing in San Juan, Rizal at the time of his death. The will was
executed in the City of Manila. Undoubtedly, it cannot be said, and
there is no evidence, that Spanish is the language currently used
either in San Juan, Rizal, or Manila. It follows, therefore, that no
presumption can arise that the testator knew the Spanish Language.</p>
<p>But petitioner-appellees insist in their brief that the burden is on
the oppositors to allege and prove that the testator did not know the
Spanish language in the face of the legal presumptions that "the law
has been obeyed", "that a will executed in the Philippines must be
presumed to have been executed in conformity with the laws of the
Philippines".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and "that
things have happened in accordance with the ordinary course of nature
and the ordinary habits of life", concluding that it would certainly be
contrary to, the ordinary habits of life for a person to execute his
will in a language unknown to him. This, we believe, is, to use a
colloquial term, begging the question. If the argument of counsel is
correct, then every unopposed will may be probated upon its mere
presentation in court, without need of producing evidence regarding its
execution. Counsel's statement is its own refutation.</p>
<p>We find, however, in the record some indicia, although insufficient
to give rise to the presumption, that the testator might, in fact, have
known the Spanish language. In oppositors' own Exhibit 3 (a letter
admittedly written by the testator) appear the salutation "Querido
Primo" and the complimentary ending "Su primo" which are Spanish terms.
Having found that all the formal requisites for the validity of the
will have been satisfactorily established, except the language
requirement, we deem it in the interest of justice to afford the
parties an opportunity to present evidence, if they so desire, on this
controverted issue.</p>
<p>Wherefore, let the records of this case be remanded to the court of
origin for further proceedings as above indicated, without costs. It is
so ordered.</p>
