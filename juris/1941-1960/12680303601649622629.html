				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">At&nbsp; about 11:00 o'clock&nbsp; in the&nbsp; evening of&nbsp; November 5, 1953,&nbsp; the reports&nbsp; of gunfire awaked the&nbsp; spouses&nbsp; Vicente Pacson and Cipriana Tadeo, the 4&nbsp; minor&nbsp; children and Cipriana's mother, Monica del&nbsp; Mundo,&nbsp; in their house&nbsp; at <span style="font-style: italic;">barrio</span> Tikiw,&nbsp; San&nbsp; Antonio, Nueva Ecija.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon, Vicente Pacson crossed the room and shouted to one <span style="font-style: italic;">Tata Pisio</span> that&nbsp; persons were going up their house and then hid himself inside the ceiling.<p>In the meantime, someone broke! the wall of the kitchen at the back of the house, and a few moments later a person suddenly entered the dining room and shouted that the door&nbsp; leading to the&nbsp; living room&nbsp; be&nbsp; opened.&nbsp; As no&nbsp; one of the h6use members obeyed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; intruder removed&nbsp; 3 board pieces in the&nbsp; wall and through&nbsp; the opening&nbsp; thus made he entered the living room.&nbsp; The&nbsp; intruder who was armed with a hunting knife was recognized&nbsp; by Cipriana Tadeo to be Agustin Mangulabnan,&nbsp; who&nbsp; was&nbsp; previously known to her.&nbsp; Agustin removed the iron bar from the door&nbsp; leading to the balcony and after opening&nbsp; said door, 2 persons whose identity has not been ascertained entered. Agustin&nbsp; then approached&nbsp; Cipriana Tadeo and snatched from her neck one necklace valued at P50 and also&nbsp; took from her person P50 in the paper bills and P20 in silver coins.&nbsp; Meanwhile, one of the two unidentified marauders searched the person&nbsp; of Monica del Mundo and&nbsp; took from her P200 in cash and in gold necklace valued at P200. But not contented with the loot,&nbsp; the same&nbsp; individual asked from Monica del Mundo to give her diamond&nbsp; ring which the&nbsp; latter could not produce, and for&nbsp; this reason, he strucked her twice on the face with the butt of his gun. One of the small children&nbsp; of Vicente&nbsp; Pacson&nbsp; who was terrified called to his mother and that unidentified person, irked by the boys impudence, made a move to strike him, but&nbsp; Monica&nbsp; del Mundo&nbsp; warded&nbsp; off the&nbsp; blow&nbsp; with&nbsp; her right arm.&nbsp; At this&nbsp; juncture,&nbsp; the&nbsp; second&nbsp; unidentified individual put&nbsp; his companion aside and climbing&nbsp; on&nbsp; the table, fired his gun at the ceiling.&nbsp; Afterwards, appellant and his two unidentified&nbsp; companion left the place.</p><p>After&nbsp; they were gone, Cipriana Tadeo called&nbsp; to&nbsp; her husband&nbsp; Vicente&nbsp; Pacson, and receiving no&nbsp; answer&nbsp; she climbed the ceiling and she found him lying face downward already dead.&nbsp; According to Dr.&nbsp; Vicente P. Llado, who performed the autopsy, Vicente Pacson sustained the injuries described in his autopsy reports, which reads as follows:</p><p align="right"><em> November 6, 1953</em></p><blockquote><p>To Whom It May Concern: </p><p>Post-mortem findings on cadaver Vicente Pacson, age—37 years, married, of <em>barrio</em>&nbsp; Tikiw, San Antonio, Nueva Ecija.</p><p>Time taken:&nbsp; 8:20 a.m.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Entrance—fracture of the frontal region of head due to gun shot&nbsp; wound.<br>Exit—wound at left side of the head, about the upper portion of the left ear.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Entrance—gunshot wound, left lateral side of the left middle arm.<br>Exit—gunshot wound inner side of left arm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></li><li>Entrance—gunshot wound, left&nbsp; lateral of the left&nbsp; forearm. Exit—gunshot&nbsp; wound, left inner&nbsp; side of the left&nbsp; forearm.<br></li>&nbsp; <li> Entrance gunshot wound&nbsp; around 2 inches more or less above the middle of the right clavicle.<br>Exit—gunshot wound at the back in the region&nbsp; of the spinal cord between the two&nbsp; scapula.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Cause of death—severe hemorrhage due to gunshot wound of the frontal region of. the forehead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>(Exhibit C)&nbsp; </li></ol><p>The incident was reported to the police authorities that same evening&nbsp; and in the ensuing investigation Cipriana Tadeo informed the Chief of Police that Agustin Mangulabnan was one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; malefactors&nbsp; who&nbsp; entered&nbsp; their house.&nbsp; When the latter was investigated,&nbsp; he&nbsp; readily and voluntarily subscribed before the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; of San&nbsp; Antonio,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija, an&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; admitting&nbsp; his participation in the robbery and killing of Vicente Pacson (Exhibit A and B).&nbsp;&nbsp; Much later, however, he subscribed to another affidavit&nbsp; before&nbsp; the Clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court wherein he&nbsp; exculpated from&nbsp; any&nbsp; participation&nbsp; Crispin Estrella, one of those he implicated in his previous affidavit, though admitting the&nbsp; truth&nbsp; of&nbsp; the other allegations&nbsp; contained therein&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; D).</p><p>As the result&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; investigation&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; by the authorities a complaint was filed&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Justice of the Peace&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; San&nbsp; Antonio,&nbsp; Nueva&nbsp; Ecija,&nbsp; against Agustin Mangulabnan <em>alias</em> Guinita, a surrendered Huk and&nbsp; 10 other&nbsp; unidentified&nbsp; persons.&nbsp; But the&nbsp; complaint was&nbsp; amended on&nbsp; January 13, 1954, to include Dionisio Sarmiento, together with Arcadio&nbsp; Balmeo, Patricio Gonzales, Florentino Flores, Crispin Estrella, Pedro Villareal, Claudio Reyes, "Peter Doe"&nbsp; and "John Doe", who were still&nbsp; at large, as defendants.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the preliminary&nbsp; investigation the case was forwarded to the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija&nbsp; where defendants were&nbsp; accused of robbery with homicide.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that Court, Agustin Mangulabnan was found guilty of&nbsp; the crime of robbery with homicide and sentenced to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, to indemnify Monica del Mundo in the sum of&nbsp; P400; Cipriana Tadeo in the sum P132; P6,000&nbsp; to the heirs of Vicente&nbsp; Pacson, and&nbsp; to pay the costs.&nbsp; Defendant Dionisio Sarmiento was acquitted&nbsp; while the information as&nbsp; against the other defendants who continued to be at large was dismissed for lack of evidence, with the proportionate part of the costs <em>de oficio.</em></p><p>Agustin Mangulabnan&nbsp; moved for a new trial on&nbsp; the ground of newly discovered evidence, but the motion was denied for lack&nbsp; of merit.&nbsp; Hence his appeal which is now before Us.</p><p>The motion for a new&nbsp; trial was based on the affidavits of&nbsp; Dr. Numeriano D. Lustre, Marino Ventura,&nbsp; Marcosa Mudlong&nbsp; and Patricio Gonzales but they were not really newly discovered&nbsp; nor could they alter the conclusion arrived&nbsp; at&nbsp; by the&nbsp; trial Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated by the Solicitor General, it is a settled rule in this jurisdiction that before a new trial may be granted on the ground&nbsp; of newly&nbsp; discovered evidence, it must&nbsp; be shown: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That the evidence was discovered after trial; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That such evidence could not have been discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence (U. S.&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Tan Jonjua, 1 Phil. 51; U.S. <em>vs</em>. Palanca, 5 Phil. 269; U.S. <em>vs</em>. De&nbsp; Leon, 1 Phil. 188; U.&nbsp; S.&nbsp; <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Zamora, 2&nbsp; Phil. 582; U. S.&nbsp; <em>vs</em>.&nbsp; Torrente, 2 Phil. 1); and&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>)&nbsp; That it is material, not merely cumulative, corroborative or impeaching (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Luzon,&nbsp; 4 thil.&nbsp; 343), and of such a weight that it would probably change the judgment if admitted&nbsp; (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Zamora,&nbsp; supra;&nbsp; U.&nbsp; S. <em>vs</em>. Alvarez, 3 Phil. 24; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Luzon, supra.; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Hernandez 5 Phil. 429; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Magtibay, 17 Phil. 417; U. S. <em>vs</em>. Tongco, 2 Phil.&nbsp; 189; People <em>vs</em>. Cu-Unjieng, 61 Phil. 906; and People <em>vs</em>. Reyes, 71 Phil. 598).&nbsp; The&nbsp; motion for new trial did not comply with these requisites and was properly denied by the&nbsp; trial Court.</p><p>Appellant's objection to&nbsp; the&nbsp; admissibility&nbsp; in&nbsp; evidence of post-morten report (Exhibit C) is evidently untenable. The fact&nbsp; that it is a mere carbon copy is of no&nbsp; moment, for it&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; signed by the physician&nbsp; who&nbsp; executed the same and&nbsp; his&nbsp; signature was&nbsp; identified by&nbsp; him&nbsp; at the witness stand.&nbsp; Furthermore, appellant&nbsp; did not&nbsp; offer any objection to its&nbsp; admission when it was presented in evidence&nbsp; at&nbsp; the hearing.&nbsp; His&nbsp; objection now comes too late (Hodges <em>vs</em>. Salas et al., 63 Phil. 567;&nbsp; U. S.&nbsp; <em>vs</em>. Ong Shiu,&nbsp; 28 Phil. 242).</p><p>The&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; did neither&nbsp; err in&nbsp; rejecting&nbsp; Exhibit 1&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; an&nbsp; affidavit&nbsp; purportedly executed&nbsp; by Sgt. Adan Fernando of the Philippine&nbsp; Constabulary.&nbsp; The main portion of it&nbsp; (quoted&nbsp; in appellant's brief, page&nbsp; 32,&nbsp; and&nbsp; appearing on page 21 of the record), is as&nbsp; follows:</p><blockquote><p>"The&nbsp; Chief of Police&nbsp; of&nbsp; San&nbsp; Antonio,&nbsp; Nueva Ecija,&nbsp; who&nbsp; first arrived&nbsp; at the scene of the crime,&nbsp; have already picked up the empty shells&nbsp; of Cal. 30, Carbine type and were delivered to Cpl. Lopez, one of the investigators of our unit.&nbsp; Information revealed that Civilian Commando of barrio Pulo,&nbsp; San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, has something to do with&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; committed, so I proceeded to barrio&nbsp; Pulo&nbsp; to&nbsp; confiscate&nbsp; their arms.&nbsp; Among those arms&nbsp; confiscated&nbsp; were those registered under&nbsp; Pedro&nbsp; Villareal and Claudio Reyes and upon&nbsp; examination of the Ballistic Experts&nbsp; in&nbsp; Camp Crame, it&nbsp; appeared positive as per Ballistic Report" (Exhibit 1). As may&nbsp; be&nbsp; seen,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; part of the aforequoted testimony of Sgt. Adan Fernando is hearsay and, anyway, it is&nbsp; of no moment&nbsp; in the case at&nbsp; bar, because&nbsp; 2 of the 3 persons who entered the dwelling of the spouses Pacson were unidentified.</p></blockquote><p>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no denial that&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of robbery&nbsp; with homicide was committed as described in the information. By appellant's&nbsp; own admission (Exhibits A and B) and the testimony&nbsp; of Cipriana Tadeo, we&nbsp; cannot have any doubt as to appellant's participation in the execution thereof. And as pointed out by the Solicitor General, appellant and the rest of the&nbsp; malefactors&nbsp; came&nbsp; together to the house&nbsp; of the&nbsp; offended&nbsp; parties&nbsp; to&nbsp; commit the robbery perpetuated&nbsp; therein&nbsp; and together went away from the scene&nbsp; of&nbsp; the crime&nbsp; after its perpetration.&nbsp; This shows conspiracy among&nbsp; the offenders&nbsp; which&nbsp; rendered each&nbsp; of them&nbsp; liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; the acts&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; others&nbsp; (People <em>vs</em>. Delgado, 77 Phil. 11).</p><p>Moreover,&nbsp; the&nbsp; record shows that appellant participated in&nbsp; the criminal&nbsp; design to commit the&nbsp; robbery with his co-defendants (People <em>vs</em>. Flores, et al.,&nbsp; G. R.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; L-231, August 21,&nbsp; 1946),&nbsp; and it is a settled rule in this&nbsp; jurisdiction that&nbsp; unity&nbsp; of purpose and action arising from a common&nbsp; design&nbsp; makes all parties thereto&nbsp; jointly&nbsp; liable (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Matanug, 11 Phil. 188), each being responsible for the result, irrespective of the character of their individual participation (U. S. <em>vs</em>. Ramos, 2 Phil., 434).</p><p>It may be argued that the killing of&nbsp; Vicente Pacson undertaken by&nbsp; one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the 2 unidentified&nbsp; persons who climbed up a table and fired at the&nbsp; ceiling, was an unpremeditated act that surged on the spur of the moment and possibly Without any idea that&nbsp; Vicente Pacson was hiding therein,&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the English version&nbsp; of Article 294, No. 1, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code, which&nbsp; defines the special, single&nbsp; and indivisible crime of robbery with homicide&nbsp; only punishes any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of&nbsp; any person, with the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> when by reason or on occasion&nbsp; of the robbery, the crime&nbsp; of homicide shall re see, therefore, that in order to, determine the existence of the crime of robbery with&nbsp; homicide it is enough that a homicide would result by reason or on the&nbsp; occasion of the robbery&nbsp; (Decision of the&nbsp; Supreme Court of Spain of November&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1892,&nbsp; and January 7, 1878, quoted in 2 Hidalgo's Penal Code, p. 267 and 259-260, respectively). This High Tribunal speaking of the accessory character of the circumstances leading to the homicide, has also held that it is immaterial that the death would supervene by mere accident&nbsp; (Decision of September&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1886;&nbsp; October 22, 1907; April 30, 1910 and July 14, 1917), provided that the homicide be produced by reason or on&nbsp; occasion of the robbery, inasmuch as it is only the result obtained, without reference or distinction&nbsp; as to the circumstances, causes, modes or persons intervening in the&nbsp; commission of the&nbsp; crime,&nbsp; that&nbsp; has&nbsp; to be taken&nbsp; into consideration (Decison of January 12/1889—see&nbsp; Cuello Calon's Codigo Penal, p.&nbsp; 501-502).</p><p>The crime&nbsp; committed in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar, of&nbsp; which appellant&nbsp; Agustin&nbsp; Mangulabnan is a&nbsp; co-participant, is the crime of&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; with homicide covered by Article 294, No. 1, of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code and punished with <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to death.&nbsp; The commission of the&nbsp; offense was attended by the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, dwelling, abuse of superior&nbsp; strength and with the aid of armed&nbsp; man,&nbsp; and in consonance with the provisions of Article&nbsp; 63,&nbsp; No. 1 of the same legal body, appellant should be sentenced to the capital punishment, as recommended&nbsp; by the Solicitor General.&nbsp; However, as the required number of votes for the imposition of the capital penalty has not been&nbsp; secured in this&nbsp; case, the penalty have been committed, but this English version of the Code&nbsp; is a poor translation of the prevailing Spanish text of said paragraph, which&nbsp; reads as follows: </p><blockquote><p>"1. Con la pena&nbsp; de&nbsp; reclusion&nbsp; perpetua a&nbsp; muerte,&nbsp; cuando con motivo o con ocasion&nbsp; del robo<span style="font-style: italic;"> resultare</span> homicidio." </p></blockquote><p>We see, therefore, that in order to, determine the existence of the crime of robbery with&nbsp; homicide it is enough that a homicide would result by reason or on the&nbsp; occasion of the robbery&nbsp; (Decision of the&nbsp; Supreme Court of Spain of November&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; 1892,&nbsp; and January 7, 1878, quoted in 2 Hidalgo's Penal Code, p. 267 and 259-260, respectively). This High Tribunal speaking of the accessory character of the circumstances leading to the homicide, has also held that it is immaterial that the death would supervene by mere accident&nbsp; (Decision of September&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; 1886;&nbsp; October 22, 1907; April 30, 1910 and July 14, 1917), provided that the homicide be produced by reason or on&nbsp; occasion of the robbery, inasmuch as it is only the result obtained, without reference or distinction&nbsp; as to the circumstances, causes, modes or persons intervening in the&nbsp; commission of the&nbsp; crime,&nbsp; that&nbsp; has&nbsp; to be taken&nbsp; into consideration (Decison of January 12, 1889—see&nbsp; Cuello Calon's Codigo Penal, p.&nbsp; 501-502).</p><p>The crime&nbsp; committed in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar, of&nbsp; which appellant&nbsp; Agustin&nbsp; Mangulabnan is a&nbsp; co-participant, is the crime of&nbsp; robbery&nbsp; with homicide covered by Article 294, No. 1, of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code and punished with <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to death.&nbsp; The commission of the&nbsp; offense was attended by the aggravating circumstances of nighttime, dwelling, abuse of superior&nbsp; strength and with the aid of armed&nbsp; man,&nbsp; and in consonance with the provisions of Article&nbsp; 63,&nbsp; No. 1 of the same legal body, appellant should be sentenced to the capital punishment, as recommended&nbsp; by the Solicitor General.&nbsp; However, as the required number of votes for the imposition of the capital penalty has not been&nbsp; secured in this&nbsp; case, the penalty to be&nbsp; imposed&nbsp; upon&nbsp; Agustin Mangulabnan is&nbsp; the next lower&nbsp; in degree or <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> (Section 9, Republic Act No. 296, known as the Judiciary Act of 1948).</p><p>Wherefore the decision appealed from being&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance with&nbsp; law and the evidence, is hereby&nbsp; affirmed with</p><p>costs against appellant.&nbsp; It is so ordered.</p><p><em>Paras, C.&nbsp; J., Padilla, Montemayor,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion, Reyes, J.
