				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Defendant-petitioner Paz&nbsp; Fores brings this petition for review&nbsp; of the&nbsp; decision of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals (C.&nbsp; A. Case&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 1437-R)&nbsp; awarding to the&nbsp; plaintiff-respondent Ireneo&nbsp; Miranda&nbsp; the&nbsp; sums&nbsp; of P5,000 by&nbsp; way&nbsp; of actual damages and counsel fees, and P10,000 as moral damages, with costs.<br><br>Respondent was&nbsp; one of&nbsp; the passengers&nbsp; on a&nbsp; jeepney driven&nbsp; by Eugenio Luga.&nbsp; While the vehicle was descending the Sta. Mesa bridge at an excessive rate of speed, the driver lost control&nbsp; thereof, causing it to swerve and to hit&nbsp; the bridge&nbsp; wall.&nbsp; The accident&nbsp; occurred&nbsp; on&nbsp; the morning of March 22,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; Five of the&nbsp; passengers were injured, including the respondent&nbsp; who suffered a&nbsp; fracture of the&nbsp; upper right&nbsp; humerus.&nbsp; He was taken to&nbsp; the National&nbsp; Orthopedic Hospital&nbsp; for treatment,&nbsp; and later was subjected to&nbsp; a series of operations; the first on May 23, 1953, when&nbsp; wire loops were&nbsp; wound around the&nbsp; broken bones and screwed&nbsp; into place; a second,&nbsp; effected to insert a metal splint,&nbsp; and a&nbsp; third&nbsp; one&nbsp; to&nbsp; remove&nbsp; such splint. At the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial, it appears&nbsp; that respondent had not yet recovered the&nbsp; use of&nbsp; his&nbsp; right&nbsp; arm.<br><br>The driver was charged&nbsp; with serious physical&nbsp; injuries through reckless imprudence,&nbsp; and&nbsp; upon interposing a plea of guilty was sentenced&nbsp; accordingly.<br><br>The contention that the evidence did not&nbsp; sufficiently establish the&nbsp; identity of the vehicle as that belonging to the petitioner was rejected by the appellate court which found, among other things, that it carried plate No.&nbsp; TPU-1163, series&nbsp; of 1952,&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; City,&nbsp; registered&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; name&nbsp; of Paz&nbsp; Fores, (appellant herein) and that the vehicle even had&nbsp; the name of "Dona Paz" painted below&nbsp; its&nbsp; windshield.&nbsp; No evidence to the contrary was&nbsp; introduced&nbsp; by the petitioner, who relied on an attack upon the credibility of the two policemen who went to the&nbsp; scene of the incident.<br><br>A&nbsp; point to&nbsp; be further remarked is petitioner's contention that on&nbsp; March 21,&nbsp; 1953, or one day before the&nbsp; accident happened,&nbsp; she allegedly sold the passenger&nbsp; jeep that was involved therein to&nbsp; a certain Carmen Sackerman.<br><br>The initial problem&nbsp; raised by the petitioner&nbsp; in this appeal may be formulated&nbsp; thus—"Is the approval of the Public&nbsp; Service&nbsp; Commission necessary for&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale of a public&nbsp; service vehicle even without conveying&nbsp; therewith the authority to operate the same?"&nbsp; Assuming the dubious sale&nbsp; to be&nbsp; a fact, the Court of Appeals answered&nbsp; the query in the affirmative.&nbsp; The ruling should&nbsp; be upheld. Section 20&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Public Service Act (Commonwealth Act No. 146)&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 20. Subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; established&nbsp; limitations and&nbsp; exceptions&nbsp; and saving provisions to the contrary, it shall&nbsp; be unlawful&nbsp; for&nbsp; any public service or for the owner, lessee or operator thereof, without the previous approval and authority of the Commission previously had—<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>(g) To sell, alienate, mortgage, encumber&nbsp; or lease its property, franchises, certificates,&nbsp; privileges,&nbsp; or&nbsp; rights,&nbsp; or any part thereof; or merge or consolidate its property, franchises, privileges or rights, or any&nbsp; part thereof, with those of any&nbsp; other public service.&nbsp; The approval herein required&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; given,&nbsp; after notice to the&nbsp; public and after hearing the persons interested at a public hearing, if&nbsp; it be shown that there are just and reasonable grounds&nbsp; for making the mortgage or encumbrance, for liabilities&nbsp; of more&nbsp; than&nbsp; one year maturity, or the sale, alienation,&nbsp; lease, merger,&nbsp; or consolidation to be approved and&nbsp; that the same are not detrimental to&nbsp; the public interest, and in&nbsp; case of. a sale, the date on&nbsp; which&nbsp; the same is&nbsp; to be consummated shall be fixed in&nbsp; the&nbsp; order of approval: <i>Provided, however</i>, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the&nbsp; transaction&nbsp; from&nbsp; being negotiated or&nbsp; completed&nbsp; before&nbsp; its approval or to&nbsp; prevent the sale, alienation, or lease by any public service of any of its property in the ordinary&nbsp; course&nbsp; of its business."<br></blockquote>Interpreting the effects of this particular provision of law, we&nbsp; have&nbsp; held in&nbsp; the recent&nbsp; cases of&nbsp; Montoya <i>vs.</i> Ignacio,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[* ]</sup>50 Off. Gaz. No. 1, p.&nbsp; 108; Timbol <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Osias,&nbsp; et al., G. R.&nbsp; No. L-7547,&nbsp; April 30,&nbsp; 1955, and Medina <i>vs.</i> Cresencia,&nbsp; 99&nbsp; Phil,&nbsp; 506; 52&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz.&nbsp; No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 4606, that a transfer contemplated&nbsp; by&nbsp; the law, if&nbsp; made without the requisite approval of the&nbsp; Public Service Commission, is not effective and binding in so far as the&nbsp; responsibility of the grantee under the franchise in relation to the public is concerned.&nbsp; Petitioner assails, however, the applicability of these rulings to the instant&nbsp; case,&nbsp; contending that&nbsp; m those cases,&nbsp; the operator did not convey,&nbsp; by lease or by sale,&nbsp; the vehicle independently&nbsp; of&nbsp; his rights under the franchise.&nbsp;&nbsp; This line of reasoning&nbsp; does not find support in the law.&nbsp; The provisions of the statute are clear and prohibit the sale, alienation, lease, or encumbrance of the property, franchise, certificate,&nbsp; privileges&nbsp; or rights, or any part thereof of the owner or operator of the public service&nbsp; without&nbsp; approval or authorization&nbsp; of the Public Service&nbsp; Commission.&nbsp; The&nbsp; law&nbsp; was designed&nbsp; primarily for the&nbsp; protection&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; public interest;&nbsp; and until the approval of&nbsp; the Public&nbsp; Service Commission&nbsp; is&nbsp; obtained the vehicle&nbsp; is,&nbsp; in&nbsp; contemplation of law, still under the service of the owner or operator standing in the records of the Commission which the&nbsp; public has a right&nbsp; to&nbsp; rely upon.<br><br>The <i>proviso</i> contained in&nbsp; the aforequoted&nbsp; law,&nbsp; to the effect&nbsp; that nothing therein&nbsp; shall be&nbsp; construed&nbsp; "to&nbsp; prevent the transaction from being negotiated or completed before its approval", means only&nbsp; that the&nbsp; sale without the required approval is still&nbsp; valid&nbsp; and&nbsp; binding between&nbsp; the parties (Montoya <i>vs.</i> Ignacio, <i>supra</i>).&nbsp; The phrase "in the ordinary course&nbsp; of&nbsp; its business" found in the other proviso "or to prevent the&nbsp; sale, alienation, or lease by any public service of any of its property", as&nbsp; correctly observed by the lower court,&nbsp; could&nbsp; not&nbsp; have been intended to include the sale of the vehicle&nbsp; itself, but at most may refer&nbsp; only to&nbsp; such property that may&nbsp; be conceivably disposed or by the carrier in the ordinary&nbsp; course of&nbsp; its business,&nbsp;&nbsp; like junked equipment or spare parts.<br><br>The case of Indalecio&nbsp; de Torres&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Vicente Ona&nbsp; (63 Phil.,&nbsp; 594, 597)&nbsp; is enlightening; and&nbsp; there, it was held:<br><blockquote>"Under&nbsp; the law, the Public&nbsp; Service Commission has not&nbsp;&nbsp; only general supervision and regulation of, but&nbsp; also full jurisdiction and control&nbsp; over all public utilities including&nbsp; the&nbsp; property, equipment and facilities used,&nbsp; and the property rights and franchises&nbsp; enjoyed by every individual and company engaged&nbsp; in the performance of a public service in the sense this phrase is used in the Public Service Act or Act No. 3108&nbsp; (sec.&nbsp; 1308).&nbsp;&nbsp; By virtue of the provisions of said Act, <span style="font-style: italic;">motor vehicles used in the performance of a service, as the transportation of freight</span> from one&nbsp; point to&nbsp; another, have to this date&nbsp; been considered—and&nbsp; they&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; but be so&nbsp; considered public service property; and, by reason of&nbsp; its own nature, a TH truck, which means&nbsp; that&nbsp; the operator thereof places it at the disposal of&nbsp; anybody who is willing&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; a rental for&nbsp; its&nbsp; use, when he&nbsp; desires to&nbsp; transfer or carry&nbsp; his effects, merchandise or any other cargo from one place to another, is necessarily a public service property."&nbsp; (Emphasis&nbsp; supplied)<br></blockquote>Of course, this Court has held in the case of Bachrach Motor Co. <i><i>vs.</i></i> Zamboanga Transportation Co., 52 Phil., 244, that there may be a mine pro&nbsp; tune authorization which has the effect of having&nbsp; the approval&nbsp; retroact to the date of the transfer; but such outcome&nbsp; cannot prejudice rights intervening in the meantime.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears&nbsp; that no&nbsp; such approval was given by the Commission before&nbsp; the accident occurred.<br><br>The P10,000&nbsp; actual damages awarded&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Manila were reduced by the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals to only P2,000, on the ground that a&nbsp; review of&nbsp; the records failed to&nbsp; disclose a sufficient basis for the trial&nbsp; court's appraisal, since the only evidence&nbsp; presented on this point consisted of respondent's bare statement that his&nbsp; expenses and&nbsp; loss&nbsp;&nbsp; of income amounted to P20,000. On the other hand, "it cannot be denied," the lower court said, "that appellee&nbsp; (respondent) did incur expenses."&nbsp; It is&nbsp; well&nbsp; to note further&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; was&nbsp; a painter by profession and a professor&nbsp; of&nbsp; Fine Arts,&nbsp; so that the amount&nbsp; of P2,000 awarded cannot be said to&nbsp; be&nbsp; excessive&nbsp; (see&nbsp; Arts. 2224 and 2225, Civil&nbsp; Code&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines).&nbsp; The attorney's&nbsp; fees in the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; P3,000&nbsp; also awarded to the respondent are assailed on the ground that the Court of First Instance&nbsp; did not&nbsp; provide for&nbsp; the same, and since no appeal was&nbsp; interposed&nbsp; by said respondent,&nbsp; it was allegedly error for the Court of Appeals to&nbsp; award them <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span>.&nbsp; Petitioner fails&nbsp; to note that attorney's fees are&nbsp; included&nbsp; in the concept of actual damages under the Civil Code and may be&nbsp; awarded whenever the court deems it just and equitable (Art. 2208, Civil Code of the Philippines).&nbsp;&nbsp; We see no reason to alter these awards.<br><br>Anent the&nbsp; moral&nbsp; damages ordered&nbsp; to&nbsp; be paid&nbsp; to&nbsp; the respondent, the&nbsp; same&nbsp; must&nbsp; be discarded.&nbsp; We have repeatedly ruled&nbsp; (Cachero <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Manila Yellow Taxicab Co. Inc., 101 Phil., 523; 54 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., [26], 6599; Necesito, et al <i>vs.</i> Paras, 104 Phil., 75; 56&nbsp; Off. Gaz.,&nbsp; [23] 4023, that moral damages are not recoverable in damage actions predicated on a breach of the contract&nbsp; of transportation, in&nbsp; view of Articles 2219&nbsp; and 2220 of the&nbsp; new&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code, which provide as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 2219. Moral damages may be recovered in the following and analogous cases:<br><br>(1) A criminal offense&nbsp; resulting in physical injuries;<br>(2) Quasi-delicts causing physical&nbsp; injuries;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *<br></div><br>Art. 2220. Willful injury to property&nbsp; may be a&nbsp; legal&nbsp; ground for awarding moral damages if the court should find that, under the circumstances, such damages&nbsp; are&nbsp; justly&nbsp; due.&nbsp; The same rule applies to breaches of contract where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith."<br></blockquote>By contrasting the provisions&nbsp; of these two articles it immediately becomes apparent that:<br><br>(<i>a</i>) In&nbsp; case of breach&nbsp; of contract&nbsp; (including one&nbsp; of transportation)&nbsp; proof of bad faith or fraud&nbsp; (<i>dolus</i>), i.e., wanton&nbsp; or deliberately&nbsp; injurious conduct,&nbsp; is&nbsp; essential&nbsp; to justify an award of moral damages; and<br><br>(<i>b</i>) That a&nbsp; breach of contract can&nbsp; not be considered included&nbsp; in&nbsp; the descriptive term "analogous cases" used in Art. 2219;&nbsp; not only because Art. 2220&nbsp; specifically provides for the&nbsp; damages that&nbsp; are caused by contractual breach,&nbsp; but because the definition of <i>quasi-delict</i> in Art. 2176 of the Code expressly <i>excludes</i> the cases where there is a "preexisting contractual relation between the parties."<br><blockquote>"Art. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a <i>quasi-delict</i>&nbsp; and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter."<br></blockquote>The exception to the basic rule of damages now&nbsp; under consideration is a mishap&nbsp; resulting in the death of&nbsp; a passenger, in which case Article 1764 makes the common carrier&nbsp; expressly subject to the rule of Art. 2206, that entitles&nbsp; the spouse,&nbsp; descendants&nbsp; and ascendants&nbsp; of&nbsp; the deceased passenger to "demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason of the death of the deceased" (Necesito <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Paras,&nbsp; 104&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 84,&nbsp; Resolution&nbsp; on&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to reconsider, September 11, 1958).&nbsp;&nbsp; But the exceptional rule of Art. 1764 makes it all the more evident that where the injured&nbsp; passenger does not die, moral&nbsp; damages&nbsp; are&nbsp; not recoverable unless it&nbsp; is proved that the&nbsp; carrier was guilty of malice or bad faith.&nbsp; We think&nbsp; it is clear that the mere carelessness of the carrier's driver does not per&nbsp; se constitute or justify an&nbsp; inference of&nbsp; malice or bad faith&nbsp; on the part of the&nbsp; carrier; and&nbsp; in the case&nbsp; at bar there&nbsp; is no other evidence of such malice to support the&nbsp; award of&nbsp; moral damages by the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Appeals. To&nbsp; award moral damages for breach&nbsp; of&nbsp; contract,&nbsp; therefore, without proof of bad faith or malice on the part of the defendant, as&nbsp; required by Art.&nbsp; 2220", would be to violate&nbsp; the clear provisions of the law, and constitute unwarranted judicial legislation.<br><br>The Court of Appeals has invoked our rulings&nbsp; in&nbsp; Castro <i>vs.</i> Aero Taxicab Co-, R. G. No. 49155,&nbsp; December 14, 1948 and Layda <i>vs.</i> Court of Appeals,&nbsp; 90 Phil.,&nbsp; 724;&nbsp; but these doctrines were predicated upon our former law of damages, before judicial discretion in fixing them became limited by the express provisions of the new Civil Code (previously quoted).&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; the aforesaid&nbsp; rulings&nbsp; are now inapplicable.<br><br>Upon the other hand, the&nbsp; advantageous&nbsp; position of a party suing a carrier for breach of the contract of transportation explains, to some extent, the limitations imposed by the new Code on the amount of the&nbsp; recovery.&nbsp; The action for&nbsp; breach of contract&nbsp; imposes on the&nbsp; defendant carrier a presumption of liability upon mere proof of injury to the passenger; that latter is&nbsp; relieved from the duty to establish the fault&nbsp; of the carrier, or&nbsp; of&nbsp; his employees, and the burden is placed on the carrier to prove that it was due to an unforseen event or to <i>force majeure </i>(Cangco <i>vs.</i> Manila&nbsp; Railroad Co.,&nbsp; 38 Phil, 768, 777).&nbsp; Moreover, the carrier, unlike in suits for quasi-delict, may&nbsp; not escape liability by proving that it has&nbsp; exercised due diligence in the selection and&nbsp; supervision&nbsp; of its employees&nbsp; (Art. 1759, new&nbsp; Civil Code; Cangco <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Manila Railroad&nbsp; Co., <i>supra</i>; Prado&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Manila&nbsp; Electric Co., 51 Phil., 900).<br><br>The difference in conditions,&nbsp; defenses and proof, as&nbsp; well as the codal concept of&nbsp; <i>quasi-delict</i> as essentially extra <i>contractual negligence</i>, compel&nbsp; us to differentiate between action <i>ex contractu</i>, and actions quasi <i> ex delicto</i>, and&nbsp; prevent us from viewing the&nbsp; action for breach of&nbsp; contract as simultaneously embodying an action on tort.&nbsp; Neither can this action be&nbsp; taken&nbsp; as&nbsp; one to enforce on&nbsp; employee's liability under Art. 103 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal Code, since the responsibility is&nbsp; not&nbsp; alleged to be subsidiary,&nbsp; nor is there on record&nbsp; any averment or proof&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver of appellant was insolvent.&nbsp; In fact, he is not&nbsp; even made a&nbsp; party to the suit.<br><br>It&nbsp; is also suggested&nbsp; that a carrier's&nbsp; violation&nbsp; of its engagement to safely transport the passenger involves a breach of the passenger's confidence, and therefore should be regarded as a breach&nbsp; of&nbsp; contract in bad&nbsp; faith, justifying&nbsp; recovery&nbsp; of moral&nbsp; damages under Art. 2220.&nbsp; This theory is untenable, for under it the carrier would&nbsp; always be deemed in bad faith, in every case its obligation to the passenger&nbsp; is infringed, and&nbsp; it would be never&nbsp; accountable for&nbsp; simple negligence; while under the law (Art. 1756). the presumption is that common carriers acted <i>negligently</i> (and not maliciously), and Art. 1762 speaks of negligence of the&nbsp; common&nbsp; carrier.<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 1756. In case of death of or injuries to passengers, common carriers&nbsp; are presumed to have been&nbsp; at fault or to have acted negligently, unless they prove that they observed extraordinary diligence as prescribed in articles 1733 and 1755."<br><br>"Art.&nbsp; 1762. The&nbsp; contributory&nbsp; negligence of the passenger does not bar recovery of damages for his death or injuries,&nbsp; if the proximate cause thereof is the&nbsp; negligence&nbsp; of the&nbsp; common&nbsp; carrier,&nbsp; but the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; damages shall be equitably reduced."<br></blockquote>The distinction between fraud, bad faith or malice in the sense of deliberate or wanton wrong doing and negligence (as&nbsp; mere&nbsp; carelessness)&nbsp; is too&nbsp; fundamental&nbsp; in our law to be&nbsp; ignored (Arts.&nbsp; 1170-1172); their consequences being clearly&nbsp; differentiated by the&nbsp; Code.<br><blockquote>"Art.&nbsp; 2201. In contracts and&nbsp; quasi-contracts, the damages for which the obligor who&nbsp; acted in good faith is liable shall be&nbsp; those that are the natural and&nbsp; probable&nbsp; consequences of the breach of the obligation, and which the parties have foreseen or could&nbsp; have reasonably foreseen at the time the&nbsp; obligation&nbsp; was&nbsp; constituted.<br><br>In case of fraud, bad faith, malice or wanton attitude, the obligor shall be&nbsp; responsible for all damages&nbsp; which may be&nbsp; reasonably&nbsp; attributed to the non-performance of&nbsp; the obligation."<br></blockquote>It is&nbsp; to be presumed,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of statutory&nbsp; provision to the contrary, that this&nbsp; difference was in the mind of the lawmakers when&nbsp; in Art. 2220 they limited recovery of moral&nbsp; damages&nbsp; to breaches of contract&nbsp; in bad&nbsp; faith. It is true that negligence may be occasionally so gross as to amount to malice; but that fact must be&nbsp; shown in evidence, and a&nbsp; carrier's&nbsp; bad faith is&nbsp; not&nbsp; to be&nbsp; lightly inferred from a&nbsp; mere finding that the contract was breached through negligence of the carrier's&nbsp; employees.<br><br>In view of the foregoing considerations, the decision of the Court of Appeals is&nbsp; modified by eliminating the&nbsp; award of P5.000.00 by way of moral damages&nbsp; (Court of&nbsp; Appeals Resolution of&nbsp; May&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1957).&nbsp; In&nbsp; all other respects,&nbsp; the judgment&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed.&nbsp; No&nbsp; costs&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp;&nbsp; instance.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes,&nbsp; A.
