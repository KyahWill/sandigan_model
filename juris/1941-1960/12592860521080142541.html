				<BR><BR><div align="justify">From the order of the Court of First Instance of Manila (Civil&nbsp; Case No.&nbsp; 22733)&nbsp; granting&nbsp; the plaintiff-appellee's (Luneta&nbsp; Motor Company) motion for the issuance of an alias&nbsp; writ of&nbsp; execution against the appellant Alto Surety &amp; Insurance&nbsp; Co.,&nbsp; Inc.,&nbsp; and from&nbsp; the order&nbsp; denying&nbsp; the latter's motion&nbsp; for reconsideration,&nbsp; the surety company has&nbsp; interposed&nbsp; the present appeal.<br><br>On June 6, 1953,&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; Alfonso Lopez&nbsp; bought&nbsp; the motor vehicle described&nbsp; in the&nbsp; complaint, and borrowed from the&nbsp; appellee Luneta Motor Company P8,800,&nbsp; which he promised to pay in 15 monthly installments.&nbsp; As security&nbsp; therefore, Lopez executed a chattel mortgage on&nbsp; the same vehicle,&nbsp; said lien being duly registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds&nbsp; of Manila.&nbsp; Lopez&nbsp; made several payments, but defaulted in the sum&nbsp; of P4,630.32.&nbsp; After repeated demands to settle this balance of the indebtedness had been made and disregarded, the company commenced foreclosure proceedings&nbsp; on the chattel mortgage.<br><br>On January 2, 1954, before sale at public auction could be made, Lopez together with his&nbsp; co-defendant Faustino Dy (to whom the vehicle was sold subject to the chattel mortgage)&nbsp; effected&nbsp; a settlement with&nbsp; appellee, whereby the two promised to pay, jointly and&nbsp; severally, the unpaid portion of the promissory note.&nbsp; Thereupon, the sale was withdrawn and the&nbsp; truck released to Dy,&nbsp; still subject to the chattle mortgage.<br><br>Dy paid the&nbsp; appellee company&nbsp; P1.000,&nbsp; again&nbsp; leaving a balance of P3,827.17&nbsp; including interest, which amount remained unpaid&nbsp; when the&nbsp; present action&nbsp; was instituted.<br><br>Upon petition of appellee and the filing of a replevin bond, the court issued a writ for&nbsp; the seizure&nbsp; of the car. The writ was later recalled upon petition of Dy, who filed a counter-bond in the amount of P12,000 furnished and subscribed&nbsp; by Dy&nbsp; as principal and the&nbsp; appellant Alto Surety &amp; Insurance Co., Inc.,&nbsp; as guarantor,&nbsp; under&nbsp; which the latter bound itself&nbsp; to&nbsp; answer, jointly and severally, with defendant Dy, for the&nbsp; delivery of the truck, if "such delivery is adjudged,&nbsp; and for&nbsp; the payment of such&nbsp; sum to him as may be recovered against&nbsp; the defendant and the costs of the action."<br><br>On August 10, 1956, the lower&nbsp; court rendered judgment, the dispositive part of which reads:<br><blockquote>"In view of the&nbsp; foregoing1, the&nbsp; court orders defendants&nbsp; Alfonso Lopez and Faustino&nbsp; N.&nbsp; Dy to pay&nbsp; jointly and severally&nbsp; to the plaintiff Luneta Motor Co. the sum of P3,825.17, with&nbsp; 12%&nbsp; interest annually from July&nbsp; 9, 1954,&nbsp; until&nbsp; the whole amount is fully paid, plus 20% of&nbsp; said amount for attorney's fees and plus costs.&nbsp; The chattel mortgage Exhibit "C" is&nbsp; hereby foreclosed.<br><br>Once this decision has become final and upon failure of the defendants to pay the said amounts, the Sheriff of Manila shall proceed to sell the truck in question at&nbsp; public auction as the law&nbsp; directs.&nbsp; For this purpose&nbsp; defendant Faustino N. Dy is ordered to deliver the truck in question to the Sheriff of Manila.&nbsp; The proceeds&nbsp; of said sale shall be applied in satisfaction of this decision. Counterclaim and/or reconvention of defendant&nbsp; is dismissed."<br></blockquote>The decision having become final&nbsp; and executory,&nbsp; upon motion of appellee,&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court, on&nbsp; October&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1956, issued a writ of execution against defendants Lopez and Dy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; writ&nbsp; was&nbsp; later returned unsatisfied&nbsp; by the Sheriff of Manila.&nbsp; Accordingly, on June 28, 1957,&nbsp; appellee filed a motion seeking for the issuance of an <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>writ of execution&nbsp; against the appellant&nbsp; surety&nbsp; company&nbsp; for the amount awarded in the&nbsp; judgment.&nbsp; This was opposed on the ground, among&nbsp; others, that appellee&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to comply with&nbsp; section&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; Rule 62, in conjunction with&nbsp; section 20, Rule 59 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, on February 11, 1957, the lower court ordered the issuance of the alias writ&nbsp; and&nbsp; denied on March 8,&nbsp; 1957,&nbsp; a motion for reconsideration of the same.<br><br>The appeal is&nbsp; well-taken.&nbsp; Only one point of law&nbsp; is in issue&nbsp; and&nbsp; it&nbsp; is the&nbsp; propriety of&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court's action in ordering the&nbsp; issuance of&nbsp; the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>writ of execution against the appellant company,&nbsp; such order having&nbsp; been applied for and granted after the main decision had long become final&nbsp; and executory.<br><br>The provisions of the&nbsp; Rules of&nbsp; Court on this point, particularly section&nbsp; 10&nbsp; of Rule 62, in connection with section 20 of Rule 59, state:<br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 10. <span style="font-style: italic;">Judgment&nbsp; to include recovery against sureties</span>.—The amount, if any, to be awarded to either party upon any bond filed by the other in accordance&nbsp; with the provisions of this rule, shall be claimed, ascertained, and granted under the same procedure as prescribed&nbsp; in section 20 of&nbsp; Rule 59."&nbsp; (Rule 62).<br><br>"SEC. 20. <span style="font-style: italic;">Claim for&nbsp; damages on&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; bond on account of illegal attachment</span>.—If&nbsp; the judgment on the action be&nbsp; in favor of the defendant, he may recover, upon the bond given by the plaintiff, damages resulting&nbsp; from&nbsp; the&nbsp; attachment.&nbsp; Such damages may be awarded only upon application and after proper hearing,&nbsp; and s<span style="font-style: italic;">hall be included in the&nbsp; final judgment.&nbsp;</span> The application&nbsp; must be filed before the trial, or, in the&nbsp; discretion of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">before entry of the final judgment,</span> with due notice&nbsp; to the plaintiff and his&nbsp; surety or sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to damages and the amount thereof. Damages sustained during the pendency of an appeal may be claimed by the defendant, if the judgment of the appellate court be favorable to him, by filing an application therewith, with notice to the plaintiff and his surety or sureties, and the appellate court may allow the application to&nbsp; be heard and decided by the trial court." (Rule 59)&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>Applying the foregoing rules, this&nbsp; Court;, in a long line of cases&nbsp; (subsequent to that of Florentino <i>vs.</i> Domadag, et al., 45&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; 11,&nbsp; 4937, 4940,&nbsp; promulgated May 14, 1948&nbsp; cited by the appellee), has held that the above provisions of law are mandatory and require the application for damages against the surety or bondsmen and the award thereof to be&nbsp; made after hearing&nbsp; and <span style="font-style: italic;">before&nbsp; the entry&nbsp; of the final judgment;</span> that if the judgment under execution contains no directive for the surety to pay, and the proper party&nbsp; fails to&nbsp; make&nbsp; any&nbsp; claim for such directive before such judgment had become final and executory, the surety or bondsmen cannot&nbsp; be later made liable under the bond.
