				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On 7  December 1953  the respondents, 65  in number, employees  of the Saulog Transit, Inc., filed in the Court of Industrial Relations a petition for a certification  election, alleging  that the total  number of employees in the Saulog Transit, Inc.  was 583; that  there were two labor organizations which represented the employees in the Saulog Transit, Inc., to wit: the Buklod ng Saulog  Transit and  the Saulog  Transit Employees Union  (PFL); and that the certification election prayed for was for the purpose  of determining  the sole bargaining  representative of the employees in the Saulog Transit, Inc.   On  23  December 1953 the president of the  Buklod ñg Saulog Transit filed its  answer  stating that on  1 (15) July  1953 a collective bargaining agreement had been entered into by and between the Buklod ñg  Saulog Transit, a duly registered union  with the Department  of  Labor, on  the one hand, and  the Saulog  Transit,  Inc., on the other; that on  5 December  an election was held  peacefully and orderly, the result  thereof having been forwarded to the  Department of  Labor, against  which  election and the result thereof no protest  as regards  the legality  thereof was lodged; that having acquired a juridical personality from time of its registration, on 15  July 1953 the Buklod ñg  Saulog Transit entered  into  a collective bargaining contract already  referred  to covering  the well being of the members of which the respondents were still members. 0n 16  February 1954 the  Saulog Transit, Inc. filed  a pleading entitled "Appearance and Manifestation"  averring that the allegation that the respondents constituted .10  per cent of the total number  of  employees of  the Saulog  Transit, Inc.  was for the  Court to determine; and that it  had dealt and had  been  dealing  with  the Buklod ñg Saulog Transit  in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement entered into by and between  them, the Buklod ñg Saulog Transit representing the employees of the Saulog Transit, Inc. as an industrial unit. After hearing, on 17 May 1954 the Court rendered judgment directing—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*  * * that a certification election be held  among the employees and/or  laborers  of  the Saulog  Transit, Inc. at Pasay  City, in accordance'with section 12 of  Republic Act  No.  875, and in  confortuity with the  Rules promulgated by this  Court on September 4, 1953.</p>
  <p>All the employees and/o.r laborers whose names appear  in the list  submitted  by the  company and marked  as  Exhibits  "E" to "7M, attached to  the records of  this case, minus the  supervisory ' personnel composed  of the  General Manager, Assistant General Manager, the two guards, one shift foreman, and one  accountant, shall be  eligible, to vote.</p>
  <p>Let a  copy of this order be  furnished the  Department of Labor for  its information and guidance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A motion  for reconsideration  having been denied by the Court <em>in banc</em> on 12 July 1954, the  Buklod ng Saulog Transit prays for a review of the order of the Court of Industrial Relations dated 17 May 1954  and the resolution of the Court in bane dated 12 July 1954 denying its motion ,for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The  logical  inference that may  be  drawn from  the order appealed from is that the Court of Industrial Relations could not  determine or at least was  in doubt  as to which of  the  two labor unions  named  in  the  petition was  the true  choice of  the laborers or employees of the Saulog Transit, Inc. to  represent  them in all their  dealings   or for  the  purpose  of  collective  bargaining  with their employer as regards the "rates of pay, wages, hours of  employment and other conditions of employment," and for that  reason  the trial  court  ordered a certification election pursuant  to section 12(6), Republic Act No. 875. </p>
<p>The Court of Industrial  Relations made the following findings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>From the evidence,  the following are explicit in the pleadings and documents as well as the testimonies  submitted by the parties. It appears that  the  Saulog  Transit, Inc.  is engaged in the transportation business in  Manila and surrounding cities and employs 583 workers including supervisory personnel; that  there  exists  in the company two unions, namely, the Buklod Ñg Saulog Transit, the intervenor  in this  case, and  the Saulog  Employees  Union (PFL); that the petitioners numbering  65 are all employees of the company; that there  exists a collective bargaining contract (Exhibit 10) dated  July  15,  1953,  between the Saulog  Transit,  Inc. and the Buklod  ftg  Saulog Transit with a supplementary agreement (Exhibit "10-1") entered into on January  10, 1954, a month after the petition for  certification election  was filed and already  being investigated by this  Court.</p>
  <p>The fundamental  issue to be resolved  in the  present case  is whether or not an order of  certification election shall issue on the basis  of the evidence established.</p>
  <p>By  stipulation of  the parties  it was  agreed in open  Court that instead  of  a  petition for certification  election  confined to drivers and conductors as the appropriate  bargaining unit in the Saulog Transit, Inc., the parties have  agreed on  the employer's unit.</p>
  
  <p>At the hearing on  January 16, 1954, counsel for petitioner manifested in open Court that out of the 65 signatories to the petition, 3 are inspectors  and inasmuch as the inspectors  are supervisors he moved that they be  stricken out of the  petition, thereby leaving a total of 62 signatories to  the petition.</p><p align="center">
    *           *           *           *           *           * </p>
  <p>The  evidence  show  that  a total  of  583  are  employed in the Saulog  Transit,  Inc.  Out of said  number, the Court  holds  that the  following should be excluded as they come within the disqualifying category of  "supervisors",  namely,  one (1) assistant General Manager;  two  (2)  guards;  one (1) shift foreman;  and  one (1) accountant. With regards to the 28 inspectors, which  counsel fox petitioners  contends to  be supervisors  without presenting  evidence on the  matter, the Court is  of  the  opinion that  inspectors  in transportation business by the nature of  their work do  not fall within the category of supervisors  under Section  2(k) of  Republic Act No. 875.             .</p>
  <p>On the  basis  of those retractions,  intervenor  maintains that the petitioner can  only lay claim to forty-two (42)  on their side and,  therefore, this number no longer constitute ten  (10%) per cent  of  all the  employees in the company minus the  supervisory personnel.   On  the  subject of these  retractions during the  hearings of  this case by the signatories to  the petition, the Court cannot help  but entertain doubts' that  it was  their free  and untrammeled will without  pressure  from  without (within). It  is to be  noted that  during one of  tine hearings of  this case, counsel for intervenor presented a letter  (Exhibit  "A")  dated December 23,  1953, purportedly signed  by  53 signatories  to  the  petition  addressed  to Marciano Casalla, president of the Saulog Employees Union (PFL) and one of the petitioners in this case, wherein it was  stated that what they  signed  before  Marciano Casalla   was not  what they really signed for.   During the next hearing on January 19,  1954, counsel for petitioners  presented a  document   (Exhibit "B")  dated January 9,  1954, addressed to the Court and purportedly signed by 21  out of the  53 signatories of the letter marked  as  Exhibit "A", wherein  it was stated that when the company  knew of their signatures to the  petition for  certification  election, they were  told to sign the letter (Exhibit "A") or else they will lose their jobs.</p>
  <p>Marciano Casalla testified at the  hearings on January 19,  1954, when  confronted with  the  aforementioned documents,  that the signatories of Exhibit "A" told  him that they were forced  to sign said letter.   Asked  by  counsel  for  intervenor  how  the  signatories were  forced  to  sign, he testified that some of the signatories told him that they did not  like to sign; that some told him  they have to be rendered  drunk first before they  could  sign;  and  that  some could not ask for "vale" in the  company  unless they signed.  (Recross examination  of Marciano Casalla,  t.s.n., p. 27, hearing  of January 19,  1954.)</p>
  <p>Again at  the hearing on  February  4, 1954,  16 signatories  to the petition for certification election present signified in  open  court their desire for  a certification election.  Counsel  for   intervenor in an effort to refute what they have previously testified regarding their  desire for a certification election presented affidavit  previously signed by some of them.  Feliciano Ignacio when shown the  affidavit (Exhibit "D-l")  he previously signed stated that he signed  said affidavit in his  desire to work; P. de  Luna testified that he signed the  affidavit  (Exhibit  "3")  believing  that  it was  for the  return of the fund deposits and there was nothing mentioned about certification election;  Gallardo testified that he signed  the affidavit  (Exhibits "D-3" and "D-4")  in  his desire to be employed; A. Aide testified that he  signed the affidavit  because  he wanted to be assigned to a trip; N. Alcantara  testified that he  signed  the affidavit because he was afraid to  be  rejected in his  work.</p>
  <p>From  the demeanor  of the witnesses in the witness stand  and the testimonies of the above-mentioned witnesses, the Court believes that those  retractions  could not destroy the  desire of all signatories constituting, at least, ten (10%) per cent of the employees in the  appropriate unit desiring  a certification election.  The manner in which the retractions  were obtained  more than convinces  the Court  of the need  for a certification election so  that the  doubt as to  the true  bargaining  representative will be  finally  resolved. Eepublic  Act No.  875  states  the remedy—a certification election. Besides,  it  should  be noted that section 12  ol  Republic  Act  No. 875  speaks  of the ten  (10%) per cent at the time  of  the filing of the  petition.  Retractions and withdrawals,  therefore, after  the petition  is filed  cannot affect the number of the petitioners  at the time the petition is filed.                                '</p>
  <p>Intervenor also  offered in  evidence a collective bargaining agreement it  had  with the Saulog  Transit,  Inc., marked as  Exhibit "10" and contends that it is a bar to the petition for certification election.   A careful scrutiny of such contract reveals that it does not touch in substantial  terms the rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other conditions of employment of all the employees in the  company  but seeks to establish merely a grievance procedure for  drivers, conductors and inspectors  who  are  members of  the Buklod Ñg  Saulog.</p>
  <p align="center">*       *         *         *        *         *       </p>
  <p>From  the evidence on  record,  it appears that  a  supplementary contract  (Exhibit "10-1") providing for increase in pay, fixing of guarantee deposits  for conductors and  drivers, granting of loans to immediate  members of  the family of the union employees in case of death, and granting daily bonus to drivers and conductors who have reached  their  daily  quota of  collection,  have  been  executed between  the  Saulog Transit,  Inc.,  and the  Buklod Ñg Saulog Transit * * *.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In its brief the petitioner  contends that  (1)  the Court of Industrial  Relations erred in  holding that it did not lose jurisdiction over  the case notwithstanding the fact that the respondents (petitioners in the court below)  were reduced to less than 10 per cent of the appropriate  unit; and (2)  the Court  of Industrial Relations  erred in  its interpretation of  section IS,  Republic Act No.  875,  relative to th.e kind of collective  bargaining agreement which would constitute a bar to a  certification  election, and  in declaring  that  Exhibit 10  (whether  by itself or as supplemented by Exhibit 10-1) did not constitute a sufficient bar to a certification election.</p>
<p>In support of its petition filed in the Court of Industrial Relations  the petitioner Buldod ñg Saulog Transit raised the following Questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Does the collective bargaining  agreement between  the  Buklod and the Saulog Transit, Inc. (consisting of Exhibits 10 [and] 10-1) conform as to contents" to  the bargaining contract contemplated in Section 13 of Republic Act 875?  If so, is it a bar to certification election? (Exhibits 10 and 10-1 are  Annexes D and E, respectively.)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>What  is the  effect of the holding of certification election  on the collective bargaining agreement  previously entered  into  by the parties mentioned in Question  1?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first error the  petitioner  claims the Court of  Industrial Relations committed is not  well  taken, not only because of the rule laid down in cases  decided under section 4, Commonwealth Act No.  103, as amended  by section 2 of Commonwealth Act No. 559, consistently followed and maintained  in this  jurisdiction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  to the effect  that the Court of  Industrial  Relations acquires jurisdiction  of  an industrial  dispute upon  the filing  of a  petition  by  31 employees  or laborers bringing such dispute to the  Court for determination, and  that a diminution in number  by retraction  or withdrawal of any of them does not  divest it of its jurisdiction  already acquired, but  also  because as found by the Court of Industrial Relations, the retraction by some  members  who originally had sighed the petition was not  of their  own  free will.  The  petition filed by 65 laborers or  employees of the  Saulog Transit, Inc., was sufficient to confer jurisdiction  upon the  Court of Industrial Relations,  for their number was  more than 10 per cent of the laborers and  employees of the  Saulog Transit, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>It is  argued  that under and  pursuant to section  13, paragraph  1, of Republic  Act  No.  875,  which  provides that—</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the absence of an agreement or  other voluntary  arrangement providing for a more expeditious manner of collective bargaining, it shall be  the duty of an employer and the representative  of his employees to bargain collectively in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Such duty  to bargain collectively means  the performance  of the mutual  obligation  to meet and confer promptly and expeditiously and in good faith, for the purpose of negotiating an agreement with respect to wages, hours, and/or other terms and conditions of employment, and  of executing a written contract incorporating  such agreement  if requested by either party, or  for the purpose of adjusting any grievances or question  arising under such agreement, but such duty does  not compel any party to agree to a proposal or to make  concession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there  was no need or reason for ordering a certification election, because on 15 July 1953  the petitioner Buklod ng Saulog Transit  and the Saulog  Transit, Inc. had already  entered into a  collective  bargaining agreement,  as shown by Exhibit 10.</p>
<p>The provisions of section 13, paragraph 1, of Republic Act No. 875, contemplate a situation not only where there had been no agreement entered  into  by and between employees  or laborers and employer or  management as to terms and conditions of employment, but also where there had  been an agreement that leaves out many or some matters on which the parties should  have stipulated, if the collective bargaining agreement  is to achieve its purpose and aim—industrial peace. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p>The trial court found that the  collective bargaining agreement entered into by  and between the Saulog Transit, Inc.  and the Buklod ñg Saulog Transit on 15 July 1953  (Exhibit 10; Annex D) "does  not touch in substantial terms the rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other conditions of employment of all the employees in the company but seeks to establish  merely a  grievance procedure for drivers, conductors and  inspectors who are members of the Buklod ñg Saulog."   And even  in the supplementary agreement (Exhibit 10-1; Annex E), there is no clearcut  stipulation  as  to  "rates of pay,  wages, hours  of employment, or  other  conditions  of employment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>   In their reply the respondents claim  that such an agreement  (Exhibit  10;  Annex  D)  and the  supplementary agreement (Exhibit 11; Annex E)  have not been identified and offered  in evidence and should not be taken into consideration.  The trial  court took,  however,  into consideration both  agreements and  found  that the  first agreement being incomplete does  not bar a certification election; and as  to  the  supplementary  agreement the Court held  that it having been  entered  into  after the filing of the petition  for a certification election the same cannot and does not bar a certification election.  The affidavit filed by  the President of  the  Buklod ng  Saulog Transit  (Annex F)  is not mentioned in  the  order and resolution appealed from.  It is clearly an effort  on the part of the petitioner to supply what was lacking in the two  agreements already mentioned.   The contention  that as  section  13,  Republic Act No. 875,  does not  require that the agreement be in  writing unless either  party request  that  it be reduced to writing, thereby  insinuating that there  had  been a  verbal  understanding  before the written agreement was entered into, has no bearing and effect  in a case where there is a written agreement which the Court of Industrial Relations found  incomplete.  In these  circumstances  we  are of the  opinion  that the collective bargaining  agreement  entered  into on  15 July 1953 is no  bar to a certification election  at the instance of at  least 10  per cent of the employees  in an appropriate  collective bargaining Unit, pursuant to  section 12, paragraphs (<em>a</em>),  (<em>b</em>)  and  (<em>v</em>), Republic Act No. 875.</p>
<p>The  second  question raised by the petitioner in support of its  petition filed in the court below need not be passed upon.  It has  not arisen.  Any  pronouncement thereon would be obiter and not binding.</p>
<p>The  order and resolution appealed from  are affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
