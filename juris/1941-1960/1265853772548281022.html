				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a paupers'&nbsp;&nbsp; petition for a writ of certiorari.&nbsp; The petitioners plead that they and&nbsp; other&nbsp; co-defendants were charged with trespass,&nbsp; defined and punished under article&nbsp; 281 of the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; in the&nbsp; Justice of the&nbsp; Peace Court of Santa Maria,&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabela,&nbsp; where,&nbsp; after trial,&nbsp; they were&nbsp; found guilty as charged and&nbsp; sentenced to suffer 11 days of <i>arresto meyor</i> and to pay the proportionate&nbsp; costs;&nbsp; that they appealed to the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Isabela where the&nbsp; Provincial Fiscal filed the&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponding information;&nbsp; that they were released on bail pending appeal;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; on 1 August 1955 in a verified motion they prayed that&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court issue an order: declaring that&nbsp; they expressly waived their right to he present at the&nbsp;&nbsp; trial of the case; that their presence was necessary and they could appear by counsel alone&nbsp; at every of the&nbsp; trial&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annex A);&nbsp; that&nbsp; on 15 August 1955&nbsp; the motion denied&nbsp;&nbsp; (Annex B),&nbsp; and on 7 March 1956 the motion for&nbsp; resopideration was likewise denied;&nbsp; and that&nbsp; as the&nbsp;&nbsp; Court&nbsp; acted in excess of its&nbsp; jurisdiction and/or with grave&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; of discretion in denying their motions and as&nbsp; there was no appeal nor any&nbsp; plain,&nbsp; speedy and adequate remedy in the&nbsp; ordinary course of law,&nbsp;&nbsp; they pray that a writ issue&nbsp; "declaring that the Orders of the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Judge are contrary to&nbsp; law and&nbsp; declaring further that&nbsp; the&nbsp; personal presence of the&nbsp; accused, is not&nbsp; indispensable&nbsp; at all stages of the&nbsp; trial of&nbsp; Criminal Case No. 1622 of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Isabela and&nbsp; that they may appear by attorney alone at all stages of the&nbsp;&nbsp; trial of said case;" and&nbsp; ordering the respondent court&nbsp; "to desist from * * * proceeding on the&nbsp;&nbsp; case * * * until further order ,of this Honorable&nbsp; Court,"<br><br>The Solicitor General admits "the allegations of fact as well as the&nbsp; conclusions of law set forth in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; petition;" concedes that&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; personal presence&nbsp; of the petitioners either at the arraignment&nbsp; or during the&nbsp; trial proper&nbsp; of their&nbsp; case before the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp;&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of Isabela&nbsp; is not necessary and may be waived;" and offers&nbsp; "no objection to the granting of the&nbsp; relief prayed, for."<br><br>Section 2,&nbsp; Rule&nbsp; 112,&nbsp; provides: <br><blockquote>If the&nbsp;&nbsp; charge is for&nbsp; an&nbsp; offense within the jurisdiction of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Courts of First&nbsp; Instance,&nbsp; the defendant must&nbsp; be&nbsp; personally present at the arraignment,&nbsp; and if for&nbsp; a light&nbsp; offense triable by the justice&nbsp; of the&nbsp; peace or any other inferior&nbsp; courts of similar jurisdiction he may appear by attorney.</blockquote>Section 3, Rule 114,&nbsp; provides: <br><blockquote>A plea of guilty can be put in only by the defendant himself in open court.</blockquote>For light offenses triable by the&nbsp; justice&nbsp; of the peace any other inferior courts of similar jurisdiction,&nbsp; the defendant&nbsp; need not be present and may appear by attorney at the arraignment&nbsp; if his plea&nbsp; is not guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On appeal to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First Instance,&nbsp; which is a continuation of the proceedings the&nbsp; justice of the&nbsp; peace court or municipal court, although e case is to be tried <i>de novo</i>, the defendant need not&nbsp;&nbsp; also present and may appear by attorney at the arraignment&nbsp; if his I plea is not guilty.<br><br>The&nbsp; petitioners in the&nbsp; case at bar were charged with and found, guilty&nbsp; of trespass,&nbsp; a light felony,&nbsp; as defined and.&nbsp; punished under article 281 of the&nbsp; Revised Penal&nbsp; Code,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their motion filed on appeal in. the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance of Isabela dated 1 August&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; they allege —<br><blockquote>6.&nbsp; That&nbsp; they have irrevocably decided to enter the&nbsp; plea&nbsp; of "NOT GUILTY" to the&nbsp; charge and&nbsp; desire to do&nbsp; so through their undersigned counsel;<br>7.&nbsp; That they desire to waive,&nbsp; as&nbsp; they hereby waive,&nbsp;&nbsp; their right&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be present at all the&nbsp; stages of the trial and to only appear&nbsp; through counsel;<br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; they&nbsp; sincerely believe that&nbsp; their&nbsp; presence in the.hearing of the&nbsp;&nbsp; case is not&nbsp; indispensable considering the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; they are&nbsp; charged with and because&nbsp; of the&nbsp; circumstances above stated,&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *.<br>(Annex A.) </blockquote>and pray that the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp;&nbsp; court issue an order&nbsp; declaring,—<blockquote><ol><li>&nbsp; That the&nbsp; accused have expressly waived their right to be&nbsp; present&nbsp; at the&nbsp; hearing of this case;<br></li><li>&nbsp; That&nbsp; they may appear by counsel alone at all stages of the&nbsp; trial of this case;&nbsp; and<br></li><li>&nbsp; That their&nbsp; personal presence is not&nbsp; indispensable.</li></ol></blockquote>The&nbsp; order of the&nbsp; respondent court assailed in. this proceedings is as follows:<br><blockquote>Upon consideration, of the motion dated August 1, 1955 as well as that of August 10,&nbsp; 1955 filed by Mr. Ventura V.&nbsp; Perez,&nbsp;&nbsp; counsel for the accused,&nbsp; and finding the reasons alleged therein not&nbsp; to be well founded;<br><br>WHEREFORE,&nbsp; said motions&nbsp; should be,&nbsp; as they are hereby,&nbsp; denied.<br><br>In view of the&nbsp; failure&nbsp; of the&nbsp;&nbsp; defendants&nbsp; and their counsel to&nbsp; appear today;<br><br>The trial, of this case is&nbsp; hereby postponed ,until further assignment.&nbsp; (Annex B.)</blockquote>The waiver by a defendant charged with a light&nbsp; felony to be present at the arraignment&nbsp; in the&nbsp; inferior&nbsp; court&nbsp; or&nbsp; in the Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; on appeal and a plea of not guilty to charge by&nbsp; counsel need not be approved by the Court for waiver and&nbsp; plea are authorized by the rule.&nbsp; He may lawfully do so without&nbsp; leave of&nbsp; court.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp; in denying the petitioners motions, the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; court did not deprive them of the right" secured to them by law to waive their presence and enter a plea of not guilty by counsel at the arraignment, nor did&nbsp; it&nbsp; compel them to appear&nbsp; personally for arraignment and trial.&nbsp; The arraignment and trial of the petitioners and their co-defendants were continued for failure of defense counsel to appear.&nbsp; Erroneous as the&nbsp; view of the respondent court may be on the point, of personal appearance of the petitioners and their&nbsp; co-defendants at the arraignment to answer a charge of a light felony, yet the orders of the&nbsp; respondent for court complained of do not call and need no action by this Court in the exercise of its&nbsp; supervisory power.<br><br>The petition is&nbsp; denied,&nbsp;&nbsp; without&nbsp; pronouncement&nbsp;&nbsp; as to costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon ,Bautista Angelo , Concepcion, Reyes J.
