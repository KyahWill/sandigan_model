				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In G. R. No. L-5824,<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> promulgated May 31,  1954, entitled "Intestate  Estate  of  the  Deceased  Natividad  Pareja. Paz Pareja, petitioner-appellee, vs.  Julio Pareja, Regina Pareja and Jose  Pareja, oppositors-appelleea, Soledad Pareja Marcial, oppositors-appellant", Julio, Regina  and Jose, all  surnamed Pareja, and Soledad Pareja Marcial sought for  a  court's order declaring  them  as  acknowledged natural children of  the intestate.   We found that  the only possible basis for their right to be  declared acknowledged natural children is  an official document entitled "Information for Membership Insurance"  signed by the  Intestate in his capacity  as an employee insured under the Government Service Insurance System.  This document bears the signature of the  Intestate, is dated March 12, 1939,  and designates the  following as  his  beneficiaries:  "Julio  Pareja—Son;  Regina  Pareja—Daughter;  Jose Pareja—Son; Paz  Pareja—Daughter."   (Exhibit  A, page 2).  We held that this document is an indubitable document  within the meaning of Article 135, paragraph  1 of the Spanish Civil Code, and under the  subsequent Article  137,  paragraph 2,  recognition may  be had even after  the death  of  the father  or mother if the indubitable  document,  before  unknown,  is  discovered and the action for acknowledgment commenced within  six  months  following  the  discovery. Our  ruling  on tin's  point and the  final  judgment we  entered is as  follows: <br><blockquote>"The record discloses that the deceased  died during the war,  and that the  petition for administration was  presented by  Paz  Pareja on  May 21,  1945.   No  allegation  is made therein that Paz  Pareja and the  other appeitees are natural children of the deceased.  From these facts  we infer that the  appellees herein may  not  have heen aware or the existence of  Exhibit A, 'Exhibit A appears to have been  secured  from  the Government  Service insurance flystem on December 10, 1949, while the trial took place on December 10, 1949. However, unless  evidence  is  submitted that tile  appellees  had  no knowledge of the  existence of  the  said  document more than fix (6)  months  prior to December 2, 1949,  they may  not  invoke or take advantage of the provisions of said  Article  137, paragraph  2, of the Spanish Civil Code. <br><br>"Wherefore,  the  order  appealed  from   is hereby  reversed,  but the appellees  are hereby granted  the right to secure a declaration that they are recognized natural  children under  the provisions of Article 137, paragraph 2, of the  Spanish Civil Code, the same to be exercised within  thirty  (80) days from the date  on which  this decision  becomes final, subject to the condition  above-mentioned. Without costs."  (Dec.  G.  R.  No. L-5824, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>.)</blockquote> The present action was brought  in pursuance  of the above  judgment.  The petitioners  allege  in their  complaint  that they came to know of the application for insurance cf the Intestate, after the Intestate's death, and in the month of November, 1949.  The oppositors deny the above  allegation  stating that  petitioners  have knowledge of the  application  for  insurance membership  and took no steps to secure their acknowledgment as natural children during the lifetime  of the Intestate,  and that more than 10 years have lapsed between  the date of the presentation of the official  document  and  the bringing  of the  action. <br><br>The petition was heard  principally upon documentary evidence and upon the following agreed fact: <br><blockquote>"5.—Que los recurrentes se entratron del hecho  de que el finado Natividad Pareja estaba  asegurado despues de muerte,  del mencionado finado."  (p. 9 Record of Appeal.)</blockquote> The trial court found  that petitioners have  not introduced  evidence to the effect that they did not have knowledge  of  the  existence of the  indubitable document for  a  period of more than  6 months before December 2, 1949, and therefore dismissed the petition. <br><br>On  this appeal the finding of  the trial court  to the effect that no evidence was  submitted in accordance with the previous decision  of this Court is not disputed.  Evidently, reliance is made on the claim that Exhibit A is a public document.  We have  already  decided that  this  is not the  public document described in Article 131 of the Civil  Code, which may be the basis  of an action for recognition.   We  are  afraid  that counsel  for petitioners-appellants failed to  understand the import of our previous decision;  at least there is no attempt to  comply with it. <br><br>Finding no  error  in the  decision  appealed  from, we hereby affirm it, with costs. <br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
