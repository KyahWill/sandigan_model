				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At about 1 o'clock in the afternoon of November 21, 1940, while the deceased Jose Simon was&nbsp; about to board a truck on Lipa Street, Sampaloc, Manila, which was to bring the athletes&nbsp; of the&nbsp; National University to the Rizal Memorial Stadium, appellant Vicente Fuentesuela&nbsp; approached him surreptitiously on the left side and without warning stabbed him with a knife on the breast.&nbsp; To the outcry of the deceased, "Why did you do that to me?&nbsp; I have not done&nbsp; anything," appellant made no reply but continued his assault causing the deceased two&nbsp; mortal wounds on the chest and wrist which produced his death.&nbsp; The motive for the crime appears to be a dispute which appellant had with the deceased who was a special policeman in the National University when the former sought admittance to a dancing party therein and&nbsp; was refused except upon deposit of one peso.&nbsp; Since then appellant harbored a grudge against the deceased as he had disclosed one week thereafter to one Francisco Carrillo who&nbsp; was&nbsp; present at their dispute and to Deputy Police Inspector Tolentino during appellant's detention.&nbsp; Upon an in formation for murder with allegation of recidivism, appellant was found guilty of the crime charged and was sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to an indemnity of P2,000.<br><br>The present appeal merely raised the question as to whether the commission of the offense was or was&nbsp; not attended&nbsp; with the qualifying circumstance of treachery and whether the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to authority should or should not be appreciated in appellant's favor.&nbsp; Upon the first question we have more than once held that <i>alevosia</i> is present where the attack is sudden and without warning. (U.S. <i>vs.</i> Babasa, 2 Phil. 102; U.S. <i>vs.</i> Manlalang, 6 Phil. 339; U.S. <i>vs.</i> De Guzman, 8 Phil. 21; U.S. vs. Barnes, 8 Phil. 59.)&nbsp; Appellant's attack upon the deceased is of this characters.<br><br>Upon the second question, it appears that two days after the commission of the offense, appellant, accompanied by Attorney ,Geronimo paredes, voluntarily surrendered to a policeman at the <i>sala</i> of Judge De la Costa.&nbsp; This is corroborated by Deputy Police Inspector&nbsp; Artemio Tolentino.&nbsp; The Solidtor-General himself does not question the presence of this mitigating&nbsp; circumstance in appellant's&nbsp; favor.<br><br>The Solicitor-General insists here that the crime is equally attended with evident premeditation.&nbsp; Two circumstances are urged to support this claim: The remark of the appellant to one Francisco Carrillo whom the former met one week after his dispute with the deceased to the effect that the deceased was <i>chiflado</i> and that some day he would kill him (the deceased); and the admission of appellant to Police Inspector Tolentino that he was in bad terms with the deceased.&nbsp; We do not think either or both of these circumstances will suffice to constitute evident premeditation.&nbsp; To authorize a finding of this aggravating circumstance, it must affirmatively appear from the overt acts of the accused that he has definitely resolved to commit the offense; that he has from then cooly and dispassionately reflected both on the means of carrying his resolution into execution and into he consequences of his criminal design; and that such an appreciable length of time has elapsed as to expect an aroused conscience to otherwise relent and desist from the accomplishment of the propose crime. Cf. U.S. <i>vs.</i> Gil, 13 Phil. 530; U.S. <i>vs.</i> Blanco, 18 Phil. 206; U.S. <i>vs.</i> Nalua. 23 Phil. 1; U.S. <i>vs.</i> Buncad, 25 Phil.530; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Cornejo, 28 Phil. 457; U. S. <i>vs.</i> Bahatan, 34 Phil. 695; People <i>vs.</i> Durante,&nbsp; 53 Phil. 363.)&nbsp;&nbsp; None of these elements can fairly be inferred from the circumstances&nbsp; urged by the Solicitor-General.&nbsp; A threat to kill, unsupported by any other evidence which would disclose the true criminal state of mind of the accused, will only be construed as a casual remark naturally emanating from a feeling of rancor and not a resolution of the character involved in evident premeditation.&nbsp; This is specially true in the instant case when for about a year appellant has ostensibly done nothing to carry out his threat.<br><br>On the other hand, the evidence discloses that appellant is a recidivist, he having been convicted three times of light physical injuries and once of serious physical injuries.<br><br>The crime committed is murder with the aggravating circumstance of recidivism offset by the&nbsp; mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction.&nbsp; The other mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender to authority brings the penalty to its minimum period, or <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period, in accordance with Article 64, paragraphs 2 and 4, of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Appellant is thus&nbsp; sentenced to&nbsp; suffer an indeterminate penalty of 12 years of <i>prision mayor</i> to 20 years of <i>reclusion temporal</i> and with this modification, judgment is affirmed without costs in this instance.<br><br><i>Yulo, C. J., Ozaeta, Paras</i>, and <i>Bocobo JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
