				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a petition for naturalization filed by&nbsp; Lee Cho <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Sem&nbsp; Lee before the Court of First Instance of Cebu.<br><br>After the reception of the evidence, the court on August 30, 1956 rendered decision finding petitioner qualified to be a Filipino citizen.&nbsp; However, on October 2, 1957, the government filed a&nbsp; motion for&nbsp; new trial on the ground&nbsp; of newly discovered&nbsp; evidence which if presented may affect the&nbsp; qualification of petitioner, and finding the same well founded, the court entertained the motion.&nbsp; After the re hearing, where the&nbsp; newly discovered evidence was presented, the court again rendered&nbsp; decision reaffirming&nbsp; its holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner is qualified&nbsp; to become a Filipino citizen, whereupon the government interposed the present appeal.<br><br>Petitioner was&nbsp; born&nbsp; in Amoy, China, on September 22, 1907,&nbsp; of Chinese&nbsp; parents.&nbsp; He came to the Philippines sometime&nbsp; in&nbsp; February, 1921 and&nbsp; was&nbsp; given the corresponding alien certificate of residence and registration. He settled in&nbsp; the City of Cebu where he has continuosuly resided&nbsp; up to the present time.&nbsp; On December 8,&nbsp; 1929,&nbsp; he married one Sy Siok Bin&nbsp; with whom he had&nbsp; 13 children, all born in the City of Cebu.&nbsp; All these children&nbsp; had been issued the corresponding alien certificate of&nbsp; registration, With the exception of Lourdes Lee who married a naturalized Filipino citizen&nbsp; named Lim&nbsp; Kee Guan.&nbsp; With the exception of William Lee who is not of school age, Angelita who reached only grade five and Lourdes who&nbsp; stopped in third year high school, the other children are&nbsp; at&nbsp; present studying in private schools and colleges recognized by the government.<br><br>Petitioner studied from first&nbsp; grade to&nbsp; seventh grade in the Cebu&nbsp; Chinese High School,&nbsp; a private institution recognized by&nbsp; the&nbsp; government.&nbsp; He and&nbsp; his&nbsp; family&nbsp; profess the Roman&nbsp; Catholic faith.&nbsp; He&nbsp; speaks&nbsp; and writes&nbsp; English and the Cebu dialect.&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1921 to the outbreak of the last war,&nbsp; petitioner was engaged in corn business in the City&nbsp; of&nbsp; Cebu&nbsp; and&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1946&nbsp; was engaged&nbsp; in&nbsp; lumber business, having been&nbsp; associated with some Filipinos.&nbsp; He invested P5,000.00&nbsp; capital in the business&nbsp; and&nbsp; at&nbsp; present the actual worth of his share is about P20,000.00.&nbsp; Petitioner is receiving a monthly salary of P400.00 and&nbsp; realizes a profit share worth P10,000.00 every year.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has no&nbsp; tax liability to the government.&nbsp; In&nbsp; other respects, he possesses all&nbsp; the qualifications and none of the disqualifications prescribed by law.<br><br>Before an applicant&nbsp; may apply for Philippine citizenship, the law requires that&nbsp; he file a&nbsp; declaration of intention to become a Filipino&nbsp; citizen one year prior to the filing of his application&nbsp; unless he is exempt&nbsp; from complying&nbsp; with said requirement&nbsp; (Section&nbsp; 6, Naturalization Law).&nbsp;&nbsp; This section exempts one from filing a declaration of intention in&nbsp; two cases:&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) if he is born in the Philippines&nbsp; and has received&nbsp; primary and secondary&nbsp; education&nbsp; in&nbsp; any school recognized by the government;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>)&nbsp; if he has continuously resided&nbsp; in the Philippines for a&nbsp; period of 30&nbsp; years or more provided&nbsp; that he has given primary and secondary education to all&nbsp; his&nbsp; children either in a public school or&nbsp; in private schools recognized&nbsp; by the government.<br><br>In the&nbsp; instant case, petitioner has not filed&nbsp; any&nbsp; declaration of&nbsp; intention to&nbsp; become a Filipino citizen because, as he&nbsp; claims, he has resided continuously in&nbsp; the Philippines for a period of&nbsp; more than 30 years and has given&nbsp; primary and secondary&nbsp; education to all his children&nbsp; in&nbsp; private schools recognized by the government.&nbsp; This claim&nbsp; is, however, disputed by the government who contends that petitioner&nbsp; has failed to comply with the requirement of&nbsp; the law regarding&nbsp; his duty to&nbsp; afford primary and&nbsp; secondary education to all his children because he failed to give such education to his daughters Angelita Lee and Lourdes Lee.<br><br>We&nbsp; find&nbsp; merit in&nbsp; this contention.&nbsp; In the first place, the evidence shows that Angelita Lee has only reached grade five and no explanation was given why no secondary education was afforded her&nbsp; which requires the teaching ox Philippine Civics, Philippine History and Philippine Government, subjects that are precisely required of aliens who desire&nbsp; to&nbsp; embrace Philippine citizenship for their indoctrination&nbsp; on matters concerning our history,&nbsp; government and nationalism.&nbsp; The reason&nbsp; advanced that she was&nbsp; not able to complete her studies because she got married is not only not satisfactory but betrays the sincerity of petitioner&nbsp; in&nbsp; embracing our citieznship.<br><br>The&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Lourdes Lee is&nbsp; even&nbsp; more&nbsp; significant.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that she studied only as far as third&nbsp; year high school&nbsp; and1 then stopped allegedly because of poor&nbsp; health. But, by her own admission in open court, it was shown that in spite of her&nbsp; alleged sickness she continued&nbsp; her studies, not&nbsp; in the high school proper, but in&nbsp; a&nbsp; Chinese school&nbsp; which employs&nbsp; strictly Chinese&nbsp; curriculum where Philippine Civics, Philippine History and Philippine Government are hot taught. This circumstance also betrays the sincerity of petitioner to become&nbsp; a Filipino citizen&nbsp; for if his&nbsp; motive were proper he&nbsp; should not have tolerated such deviation&nbsp; from the educational requirement&nbsp; of&nbsp; the law.<br><br>Considering&nbsp; that the provisions&nbsp; of the Naturalization Law should be strictly construed in&nbsp; order that its laudable and nationalistic purpose&nbsp; may be fully fulfilled,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> we are persuaded to conclude that petitioner&nbsp; has failed to qualify to&nbsp; become a Filipino citizen and so his petition&nbsp; should be denied.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is reversed, with costs against petitioner.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
