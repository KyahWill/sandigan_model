HABEAS CORPUS.â€”In a habeas corpus case, it was held: 
"Aquilino Taruc was illegally deprived of his personal freedom from 5 o'clock in 
the afternoon of July 3, 1947, to 12 o'clock noon of July 4, 1947, and, during 
which time he was entitled to be released, which is not now necessary to be 
ordered, in view of the fact that he was set free before this case had been 
heard at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of July 4, 1947, but it should be clearly 
understood that neither the respondent nor any other person should disturb him 
in the peaceful enjoyment of his personal liberty, unless authorized by law."
