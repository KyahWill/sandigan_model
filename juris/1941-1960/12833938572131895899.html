				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal taken by the Manila Port Service from a judgment
 of the Court of First Instance of Manila (in Civil Case No. 33917), 
ordering it to pay plaintiff Juan Ysmael &amp; Co., Inc., the sum of 
P800.31, with legal interest, and the sum of P200.00, as attorney's 
fees.
  <p>    Plaintiff-appellee's complaint is based on 
defendant-appellant's failure to deliver to plaintiff a shipment of 
copper tubings consigned to plaintiff, which arrived and was discharged 
in Manila into the custody of defendant as arrestre contractor, on 
December 26, 1956. The main defense of defendant is that it is relieved 
of responsibility because no claim for such non-delivery was made within
 15 days from the discharge of the last package from the carrying 
vessel, as provided in Section 15 of the Management Contract with the 
Bureau of Customs. Plaintiff countered that it was not bound by said 
Management Contract, as it was not a party thereto. </p>
  <p>    The trial court, after finding that the loss of the Copper 
tubings occurred after their discharge from the carrying vessel, 
absolved the shipping company and held the defendant-appellant liable, 
holding that the Management Contract was not binding on the plaintiff, 
its provisions not being in the nature of stipulations <u>pour autrui</u>,
 but precisely prejudicial to plaintiff, in that the Contract limits its
 rights. Furthermore, the trial court reasoned out, the said stipulation
 (the 15-day limit) is unreasonable and oppressive, because the date of 
the discharge of the last package from the carrying vessel, cannot 
ordinarily be known to the consignee of the shipment, and the latter may
 not be able to take delivery of the goods, until after the lapse of 
said 15 days, in view of the delay in the arrival of the shipping 
documents from abroad, congestion in the piers, and delay in the 
issuance of tax exemption certificates from the Department of Finance, 
and in the clearing of the documents in the Bureau of Customs. Based 
solely on the legal conclusion adopted by the trial judge that the 
Management Contract is not binding on plaintiff, and on the speculation 
of the possible contingencies mentioned in the decision that might 
justify delay in the filing of a claim beyond the 15-day period, but 
without making any finding as to the factual presence or not of any of 
them in the cause before it, judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff
 as above indicated.</p>
  <p>    In previous cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
already decided by this Court, we held that where the third party is 
duly notified, and acts with knowledge of the provisions of the 
Management Contract, such party would be bound by the Contract. In the 
case of Tomas Grocery v. Delgado Brothers, Inc. (G.R. No. L-11154, prom.
 April 29, 1959), we likewise held that under the fact therein found, 
the 15-day period provision was binding. In other words, it cannot be 
said that the Management Contract is, or is not binding on third 
parties, without regard to the facts of each particular case. And, since
 the appealed decision now before us, does not contain enough findings 
of fact upon which to resolve with justice the rights of the parties 
hereto, we decide to give them further opportunity to fully prove their 
respective contentions.</p>
  <p>    Wherefore, this case is ordered remanded to the court of origin
 for further proceedings, without costs.</p>
  <p>    So ordered.</p>
