				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Ernesto A. Silvela was arrested in Iloilo upon a sworn complaint of Rosalia 
Bermejo Palauar, which had been preliminarily investigated by the City Fiscal 
thereof.<br><br>Said complaint alleged that the accused,<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * signed, sent and addressed two unsealed letters to the undersigned 
containing a certain false, malicious and defamatory libel tending to injure and 
impeach the honesty, virtue, honor, reputation and integrity of the undersigned, 
by then and there willfully, maliciously and criminally branding, calling and 
imputing to the undersigned among others as "Pompom, Naga Business, Naga 
Prostitute, Prostitute, * * * which appear in two letters sent and addressed by 
the accused to the undersigned on September 21, 1955 and September 25, 1955 
which defamatory and libelous letters are hereunder quoted verbatim as 
follows:</p>
<p>"MY DEAR MISS ROSALIA PALAUAR:</p>
<p>Allow me to take the cudgel in responding your well-written and threatening 
letter because I am an integral member of the family of the man you alleged to 
have smeared your profession and your degree of Master of Arts, major in 
English. * * * How proud you are to announce to everybody that you have said 
degree and yet how ignorant you are even of the simple term "libel", Libel, for 
your information, is a written or printed defamation or slander. What a paradox! 
You don't know the very word, libel, and yet you have the nerve to frighten my 
brother-in-law of its consequences-of the great fine and the long imprisonment! 
You should have had consulted a lawyer before writing that ignominious letter of 
yours; he could have had informed you that the most appropriate case you can 
bring to court if there is any truth to your allegation is "oral defamation." * 
* *. I intended to return to my job this Sunday but I am postponing said trip in 
order to hear for myself the case I encourage you to bring to court at your 
earliest convenience. However, before bringing it to court, may I advise you to 
change the word naga-business to naga prostitute; otherwise you will become a 
laughing stock in court. You know, the most appropriate English term for 
"pom-pom" is prostitute. '* * *."<br><br>"DEAR MISS ROSALIA B. PALAUAR:</p>
<p>I am afraid, Madam, your mind is exceedingly polluted with your guilt or you 
simply cannot understand English sentences. I was only advising you to change 
the word, "naga business" to "naga-prostitute" since the equivalent English word 
for "pompom" is prostitute but in your last letter, according to you, I called 
you "pompom" or "naga-business." How irrelevant you are.</p>
<p>You further told me to rectify the term, prostitute. Well, I am really sorry. 
I cannot acquiesce to your kind request. I have been trained in my profession to 
be exact to the smallest fraction; hence, I always call a spade, a spade, and a 
shovel, a shovel. Besides, I cannot pick a more refined term for your implied 
idea of a "pompom." At any rate, I mean every word I say and I'm conscious of 
its consequences." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before his arraignment, Silvela moved to quash, contending that the facts 
charged did not constitute an offense. Over the fiscal's opposition, the judge 
dismissed the case explaining that "upon reading carefully the two letters 
quoted in the complaint, it does not appear that defamatory words have been 
directed against the complainant."</p>
<p>We read the letters differently. As admitted by the defendant, he first 
answered a letter of complainant to his brother-in-law wherein she had 
apparently threatened to sue the latter for having called her "naga-business' or 
"pompom." Now, in this first letter, defendant practically says, "my 
brother-in-law should have called you 'prostitute' the most appropriate English 
term."</p>
<p>The second letter responded to complainant's reply to the first. In this 
reply, complainant requested defendant to rectify the term "prostitute" which he 
had applied to her. Yet defendant answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I cannot acquiesce to your kind request. I have been trained in my 
profession to be exact to the smallest fraction; I always call a spade a spade, 
and a shovel, a shovel * * * I mean every word I say and I'm conscious of its 
consequences." (Italics Ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear in our opinion that defendant as much as said, "If I called you 
'prostitute' I decline to retract. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say." 
Defendant refused to withdraw the dagger: instead, he plunged it deeper, to the 
hilt.<br><br>Of course, it is unnecessary to add that calling a young lady 
pursuing graduate courses a "prostitute" is libelous.</p>
<p>His Honor apparently viewed the imputations in the letter as purely 
impersonal, not applying to the complainant herself. As we have already stated, 
the offensive imputations obviously referred to the addressee of the letter, who 
was therein called a prostitute.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it may be added that the obnoxious writing need not mention the 
libeled party by name (Causin vs. Jakosalem, 5 Phil., 155) the prosecution being 
permitted to prove by evidence that a vague or general imputation of 
dishonorable conduct referred to the complainant or complainants. In one of the 
most famous libel cases, an editorial about "Birds of Prey," criticising "man, 
who besides being eagles, having the characteristics of the vulture, the owl and 
the vampire, etc. etc.," was held to be libelous notwithstanding its having 
failed to identify the aggrieved parties; because proof aliunde showed that it 
referred to them. (Worcester vs. Ocampo, 22 Phil., 42.)</p>
<p>In this instance, the fiscal asserted that he could and would prove at the 
trial, that the offensive words referred to the complainant, as the complaint 
averred.</p>
<p>What evidence could the Fiscal adduce to prove the connecting link? Probably 
the complainant's letters to defendant and to his brother-in-law, the terms of 
which as we surmised, will undoubtedly reveal the connection—if still 
needed—between the insulting words and the person to whom they alluded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the motion to quash <i>must be deemed</i> <i>to have 
admitted</i> the allegations of the complaint, one of which states that 
defendant wilfully, maliciously called the <i>complainant, or imputed to 
her</i>, the words "pompom," "naga-business," "naga-prostitute," and 
"prostitute."</p>
<p>During our deliberations, the question of "publication" cropped up. Although 
it was not raised by the defendant, it was a proper subject of inquiry, since 
publication constitutes one of the essential elements of the crime of 
libel.'<br><br>We were quoted Lopez vs. Delgado, 8 Phil., 26, wherein the 
malicious defamation having been inclosed in a sealed envelope and sent by 
special messenger to the plaintiff by the defendant, it was held that no libel 
had been committed, since the letter was not published; but we noticed that 
whereas there the envelope was "sealed," here it was "unsealed."</p>
<p>And later we found U.S. vs. Griño, 36 Phil., 738, wherein the accused signed 
and sent to the offended party a letter (not shown to be sealed) charging the 
latter with having illicit relations with her (accused's) husband. She was held 
guilty of having "published" the libelous writing.</p>
<p>Now, if sending a letter "not shown to be sealed" is publication, sending of 
an "unsealed letter" as in this case, should <u>a fortiori</u> be held to be 
publication. The Griño case accords with American jurisprudence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a general rule, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, a 
communication of the defamatory matter to the person defamed is a sufficient 
publication to constitute a criminal offense." (53 Corpus Juris Secundum, Libel 
and Slander, sec. 284.)</p>
<p>"While publication within the rules relating to civil liability implies 
communication of the libel or slander complained of to a person other than the 
victim, its meaning; is considerably broader in criminal prosecutions; <i>the 
authorities appear to agree that in such cases, impartation of the defamation, 
to anyone at all-even to the person defamed</i>-constitutes such a publication as 
will support an indictment, specially when done with an intent 'to provoke a 
breach of the peace. Thus, <i>it has several times been held that publication may 
be effected within the meaning of the law by enclosing libelous matter in. 
sealed envelope and mailing or delivering it to the person therein denounced</i>." 
(33 American Jurisprudence, pp. 293-294.) Italics Ours.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not to declare the Lopez case modified or superseded by the Griño 
decision. The former involved a <u>civil</u> litigation for damages, as to which the 
prevailing view seems to be: "If the defamatory matter is not seen or heard by 
anyone except the defamer and the defamed, damages to character reputation can 
not result since a man's reputation is the estimate in which others hold him, 
and not what he himself thinks." (Many cases cited in annotation at p. 239 of 24 
American Law Reports Annotated.)</p>
<p>Wherefore, having found the letters to contain libelous matter which in the 
eyes of the law had been published, we must reverse, and hereby reverse, the 
appealed decision. The record will be remanded to the court below for further 
proceedings. With costs against appellee.</p>
<p><i>Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepdon, Reyes, J.B.L. </i>and 
<i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</p>

<p>I really do not understand why there can be any difference of opinion among 
the members of this Court on the only question at issue. The matter could be 
easily disposed of unanimously if We were to read the 2 questioned letters 
quoted infra as they are written, instead of allowing our imagination to inject 
into them words, phrases or intentions that cannot be found anywhere 
therein.</p>
<p>This case involves the determination of whether the facts averred in the 
complaint filed by Miss Rosalia Bermejo Palauar against Ernesto A. Silvela in 
the Court of First Instance of Iloilo purporting to charge the defendant with 
the crime of libel, do or do not really accuse him of that crime, or of any 
other offense. Nothing better to determine this question than to copy the 
complaint in full as I do hereunder. It reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the period comprised between September 21 and 25, 1955, in 
the City of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, said 
accused without any justifiable motive, with deliberate intent of impeaching the 
reputation, virtue and credit of the undersigned, Rosalia Bermejo Palauar, a 
person of good standing in the community pursuing Post Graduate Course at the 
University of San Agustin, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, criminally 
and maliciously cast dishonor, contempt and ridicule to the undersigned with 
malicious intent of exposing the undersigned to public hatred, contempt, 
ridicule, discredit and dishonor, said accused signed; sent and addressed two 
unsealed letters to the undersigned containing a certain false, malicious and 
defamatory libel tending to injure and impeach the honesty, virtue, honor, 
reputation and integrity of the undersigned, by then and there wilfully, 
maliciously and criminally branding, calling and imputing to the undersigned, 
among others as "Pompom, Naga Business, Naga Prostitute, Prostitute"; which 
words translated into English, mean more or less as follows: 'Prostitute, 
engaged in prostitution, is a prostitute, harlot, strumpet', which appear in two 
letters sent and addressed by the accused to the undersigned on September 21, 
1955 and September 25, 1955, which defamatory and libelous letters are hereunder 
quoted verbatim as follows:</p>

<p>Well, it is indeed a pleasure to reply to a woman of 'your distinction' and 
having a degree of Master of Arts, major in English. The only regrettable fact 
there in attaching 'the degree of Master of Arts major in English' is your 
apparent unworthiness of said degree (or are still pursuing it?); consequently 
bringing only disgrace and shame to your beloved Alma Mater. How proud you are 
to announce to everybody that you have said degree and yet how ignorant you are 
even of the simple term 'libel'. Libel, for your information,, is a writ or 
printed defamation or slander. What a paradox. You don't know the very word, 
libel, and yet you have the nerve to frighten my brother-in-law of its 
consequences-of the great fine and the long imprisonment! You should have had 
consulted a lawyer before writing that ignominious letter of yours; he could 
have had informed you that the most appropriate case you can bring to court if 
there is any trust to your allegation is 'oral defamation.' Oh Miss Palauar, 
have you forgotten the moral lesson of the story of the Three Visayans ir. the 
high school Prose and Poetry, a little learning is a dangerous thing, or '. . . 
drink deep in the Persian spring, or reveal not your little learning', says one 
of the most famous poem. Perhaps, you barely got 75% in all your subjects, hence 
this is primarily the reason of your not retaining a single moral lesson of the 
countless stories you might have read.</p>
<p>I finished only Civil Engineering in Cebu Institute of Technology and had. 
taken only 6 units of college English but I can well say that I deserve my 
degree and I am not ignorant of the common English terms. I intended to return 
to my job this Sunday but I am postponing said trip in order to hear for myself 
the case I encourage you to bring to court at your earliest convenience. 
However, before bringing it to court, may I advise you to change the word 
naga-business to naga-prostitute; otherwise you will become a laughing stock in 
court. You know, the most appropriate English term for 'pompom' is 
prostitute.</p>
<p>Finally, I am looking forward to some more letters from you and I promise 
that I will always be accommodating and courteous enough to respond every letter

<p>Miss Rosalia Bermejo Palauar<br>Lapuz Norte, Iloilo City<br><br>DEAR MISS 
ROSALIA B. PALAUAR:</p>
<p>I am afraid, madam, your mind is exceedingly polluted with your guilt or you 
simply cannot understand English sentences. I was only advising you to change 
the word, 'naga-business' to 'naga-prostitute' since the equivalent English word 
for 'Pompom' is prostitute but in your last letter, according to you, I called 
you 'pompom' or 'naga-business'. How irrelevant you are:</p>

I cannot acquiesce to your kind request. I have been trained in my profession to

idea of a 'pompom'. At any rate, I mean every word I say and I'm conscious of 
its consequences.</p>
<p>By the way, I was expecting another threat from you or a sarcastic note. I 
was awfully disappointed to find neither of them in your letter. On the other 
hand, I consider it a good sign. You know, I hate to have enemies, especially a 
woman like you but frankly, I also abhor women who are gullible and who 
immediately jump to conclusion, much more threaten an individual; nevertheless, 
it is never late. You choose from either of these two alternatives:</p>
<p>(1) Go on with your silly notion of bringing your allegation to court and 
face public disgrace and insult as an aftermath, or</p>
<p>(2) Forget everything, and we will be good neighbors and friends. <br></p><p>If you 
choose the former, go ahead. I will only request you to file it at the earliest 
possible date and inform me of said date, so that I can extend my leave of 
absence from the school. I am teaching at Cebu. I don't want the school to 
entertain the idea that I am violating the stipulation of the provision of the 
contract as embodied in the scholarship granted to me while still studying. They 
might think I am having another job here. However, if you choose the later, I 
will be more than willing to meet you at any convenient place where you and I 
alone can talk matters amicably.</p>
<p>I hope I have straightened everything and may I hear from you on Monday 
morning.</p>
<p align="right">Truly yours,</p>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) EAS <br>ERNESTO A. SILVELA"</p>
<p>when in truth and fact the above-quoted letters are false, untrue and 
malicious."</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon arraignment the accused filed a Motion to Quash on the ground that the 
facts charged in the complaint do not constitute an offense, which motion was 
opposed by the City Fiscal. Acting or. these pleadings, the Court by order of 
December 21, 1955, dismissed the complaint with costs de oficio. The City Fiscal 
filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was also opposed by the accused and 
denied by the Court; hence this appeal.</p>
<p>In this instance, the only question raised by the Solicitor General is 
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Court erred in granting the motion to quash on the ground that the facts 
charged do not constitute an offense and thereby dismissing the 
case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The record does not show that defendant-appellee filed any brief in this 
instance.<br><br>According to the trial Judge in order that the crime of libel 
may be committed, the following- elements must concur:</p>
<ol><li>Defamatory imputation which causes dishonor or discredit;<br><br>
</li><li>Malice, either in law or in fact;<br><br>
</li><li>Publication; and<br><br>
</li><li>Victim must be identifiable. </li></ol>
<p>And reasoning out this proposition, His Honor said that from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the 2 letters quoted in the complaint it does not appear that defamatory 
words have been directed against the complainant. Nowhere in the quoted letters 
does it appear that the defendant has defamed or insulted the complainant. * * 
*. If there is any imputation of immoral character in the letters, still the 
imputation is impersonal and does not point to the complainant as the person 
alluded to."</p>
<p>"Where the article is impersonal on its face and does not single gut 
individuals, there is lacking that identification of the offended party which 
the law requires (Uy Tioco et al. vs. Yang Shu Wen et al., 32 Phil. 624 People 
vs. Andrada, 37 Off. Gaz. 1783)."</p></blockquote>
<p>The portions of the letters that according to the complaint contain libelous 
matter, are the following;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, before bringing it to court, may I advise you to change the word 
'naga-business' to 'naga-prostitute'; otherwise you will become a laughing stock 
in court. You know, the most appropriate English term for 'pompom' is 
'prostitute'. (First letter)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the second letter of the defendant, quoted in the complaint, the following 
is contained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am afraid, madam, your mind is exceedingly polluted with your guilt or you 
simply cannot understand English sentences, I was only advising you to change 
the word, 'naga-business' to 'naga-prostitute', but in your last letter, 
according to you, I called you 'pompom' or naga-business'. How irrelevant you 
are." (Second letter)</p></blockquote>
<p>As may be seen from the foregoing quoted portions of the letters in question, 
the first letter was in answer to another from the complainant (the contents of 
which do not appear on record), wherein apparently defendant advised the 
complainant to change the word "naga-business" (used in said complainant's 
answer addressed to defendant's brother-in-law and not to defendant herein and 
which the latter had never used or said before), to "naga-prostitute", because 
otherwise complainant, who had been boasting of holding the degree of Master of 
Arts, major in English, would be the laughing stock in court for not using (the 
complainant, not the defendant) the most appropriate word to express the idea of 
"pompom" or prostitute. As the said first letter is written the alleged libelous 
words can by no means be said to refer to complainant, especially if 
consideration is given to the contents of the second letter (which will be 
discussed later on) wherein defendant denies the imputation that he ever called 
her a "pompom" or "naga-business". But from the majority Decision, I copy the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'As admitted by the defendant, the first answered a letter of complainant to 
defendant's brother-in-law wherein she had apparently threatened to sue the 
latter for having called her 'naga-business' or 'pompom'. Now, in his first 
letter, defendant practically (?) says, 'my brother-in-law should have called 
you 'prostitute' the most appropriate English term' ".</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first place nowhere in the first letter of the defendant does he admit 
that complainant threatened to sue his brother-in-law for having called her 
"naga-business" or "pompom". In the second place, has the defendant practically 
or otherwise said or intended to say such a thing? My previous explanation on 
this matter relieves me from commenting any further on such flagrant sprout of a 
powerful imaginative mind, for certainly the first letter of the defendant does 
not mention anything of the kind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defendant's second letter was in response to complainant's reply to his 
first. The majority Decision quotes some portions of the second paragraph of 
that second letter which I now quote in full supplying the omitted parts "which 
I write in capital letters:<br><br>"YOU FURTHER TOLD ME TO RECTIFY THE TERM, 
PROSTITUTE. Well, I AM REALLY SORRY.<i> I can not acquiesce to your kind 
request</i>. I have been trained in my profession to be exact to the smallest 
fraction; HENCE,<i> I always call a spade, a spade</i>, <i>and a shovel, a 
shovel</i>. BESIDES, I CAN NOT PICK A MORE REFINED TERM FOR YOUR IMPLIED IDEA OF 
A 'POMPOM'. AT ANY RATE, <i>I mean every word I say and I am conscious of its 
consequences."</i></p></blockquote>
<p>It will not be amiss to state at this juncture that in the first paragraph of 
said second letter defendant also writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I am afraid, madam, your mind is exceedingly polluted with your guilt or you 
simply cannot understand English sentences. I was only advising you to change 
the word, 'naga-business' to 'naga-prostitute' since the equivalent English word 
for 'pompom' is 'prostitute', but in your last letter, according to you, I 
called you 'pompom' or naga-busiiiess1. How irrelevant you, 
are.",</p></blockquote>
<p>which clearly involves a denial of complainant's imputation that he had 
called her a "pompom" or prostitute. In the majority Decision it is insisted 
that defendant said this much, i.e.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If I called you 'pompom' or 'prostitute' I decline to retract my words. I 
say what I mean, and I mean what I say. Defendant refused to withdraw the 
dagger: instead, lie plunged it deeper, to the hilt".</p></blockquote>
<p>The subscribers to the majority opinion surely deserve the degree of 
mind-readers. Of course I cannot and will not deny that calling a young lady 
pursuing a graduate course a prostitute is libelous. But has the defendant 
really called her such nasty and depredatory name?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A libel cannot be committed except against some definite person who must, be 
properly identified (People vs. Andrada, 37 Off. Gaz., 1783). * * *. But where 
no one was named or accurately described in the article complained of, it is not 
sufficient if the offended party recognized himself as the person attacked; it 
must be shown that at least one third person would so identify him as the object 
of the libelous publication (Kunkle vs. Cablenews-American and Lyons, 42 Phil., 
757). Where the article is impersonal on its face and does not single any 
individuals, there is lacking that identification of the offended, party which 
the law requires (Uy Tioco, et al., vs. Yang Shu Wen., et al., 32 Phil., 624; 
People vs. Andrada, supra).</p></blockquote>
<p>The situation depicted in the 2 letters quoted in the information is that the 
defendant-who did not know the complainant and who does not appear to have ever 
met her personally or had any previous trouble with her-officiously took the 
side of his brother-in-law and upon reading complainant's letter threatening his 
said relative with a suit in court, sarcastically commented upon the meaning of 
the words used by the complainant herself or written in her letter, and merely 
suggested the words that in his opinion were apt to convey the meaning of what 
complainant intended to say. This certainly does not constitute any imputation 
(malicious or otherwise) of a crime, vice or defect, real or imaginary, or of 
any act, condition, status or circumstance tending to cause dishonor, discredit 
or contempt of the offended party.</p>
<p>The majority of the Court further states: "In this instance, the fiscal 
asserted that he could and would prove at the trial, that the offensive words 
referred to the complainant, as the complaint averred", and I join the majority 
of this Court in asking the same question-"what evidence could the fiscal adduce 
to prove the connecting link?" To this, said majority plunges into a sea of 
suppositions and possibilities that they call probabilities, but as I have 
stated before, defendant did not know the complainant, did not have any contact 
or relation nor had any altercation with her, and under such circumstances there 
can be no evidence other than the letters that were copied in full in the 
complaint, to determine their meaning and import. Consequently, there can be no 
evidence aliunde and the fiscal could not, therefore, make any revelation other 
than his irrelevant and inadmissible opinion, or supply the alleged missing link 
between the insulting words and the person to whom they were alluded. Of course, 
under the Rules of Court, a motion to quash must be deemed to have admitted the 
averments of the complaint and although one of them states that defendant 
wilfully, maliciously and criminally called the complainant or imputed to her 
the words "pompom", "naga-business", "naga-prostitute" and prostitute, the 
majority forgets that this portion of the complaint is nothing but a conclusion 
of the fiscal and not a narration of the acts constituting the elements of the 
offense of libel that perforce have to be eviscerated from the very letters in 
question. That is the reason why the trial Judge, correctly from my viewpoint, 
held that the nasty words used in defendant's letters are purely impersonal and 
not pointing to the complainant as the person alluded to. Such being the case, 
the complaint against the defendant must be fatally defective for it fails to 
impute to any person in particular, a crime, vice, defect, act, condition, 
status or circumstances tending to cause him dishonor, discredit or contempt. 
Therefore, the order appealed from must be upheld even on this count alone.</p>
<p align="center">"* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>At the deliberation of this case, I also submitted the question of 
publication of the libel. It could not be raised by the Solicitor General 
because to do so would tend to defeat the purpose of the appeal, and it was not 
raised by defendant-appellee because he filed no brief in this instance. I will 
now proceed to answer the arguments adduced on this point in the majority 
Decision.</p>
<p>Upon reading the complaint, I find that it does not aver or show that said 
libelous matter was published and, therefore, the element of publication is 
wanting in the case at bar. The only averment in the complaint that may have any 
bearing on the point of publication is that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"said accused (wilfully, unlawfully, criminally and maliciously) signed; sent 
and addressed two unsealed letters to the undersigned containing a certain 
false, malicious and defamatory libel tending to injure and impeach, etc.". </p>
</blockquote>
<p>without stating that the letters were published or read by other persons. The 
mere act of sending or addressing 2 unsealed letters to the complainant is not 
an averment of publication. From Professor Ambrosio Padilla's Revised Penal 
Code, Annotated, I quote the following citation he makes of our decision in the 
case of Lopez vs. Delgado, 8 Phil., 26:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is an action for the libel wherein the plaintiff prayed for damages for 
an alleged malicious defamation in writing enclosed in an envelope and sent by 
special messenger to the plaintiff by the defendant. HELD: It is true that the 
messenger mig-ht have torn open the envelope and acquainted himself with the 
contents, but it is difficult to conceive of any case where one knowingly parts 
with the immediate control of libelous matter, wherein it could not be said that 
it is possible that in some way or another it might thereby become exposed to be 
read or seen by another. To hold that publication of a libel may be presumed in 
all cases where one knowingly parts with the immediate custody thereof, under 
circumstances which by any POSSIBILITY expose it to be read or seen by another, 
would be equivalent to holding that publication will be presumed in all cases 
where one parts with the immediate custody of an alleged libel. The publication 
of a libel should not be presumed from the mere fact that the immediate control 
thereof has been parted with, unless it appears that there was a reasonable 
probability that it was thereby exposed to be read or seen by third person. It 
cannot fairly be said that when the defendant inclosed the alleged libelous 
matter in a sealed envelope, addressed to the plaintiff, and sent it by 
messenger, he parted with its custody under circumstances which suggest a 
reasonable probability that is was thereby exposed to be read or seen by third 
person."</p></blockquote>
<p>The doctrine in the case of Lopez vs. Delgado, supra, was reiterated in the 
case of U.S. vs. Ramos, 28 Phil., 219, wherein it was held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * Even granting that the letter was libelous, its transmittal to the 
offended party in a closed envelope did not amount to a publication of its 
contents."</p></blockquote>
<p>Professor Padilla in his said work also cites the decision in the cases of 
People vs. Atencio, CA-G. R. Nos. 11351-R to 11353-R, promulgated December 14, 
1954, penned by the writer of this Dissenting Opinion when he was in the Court 
of Appeals, and quoted as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It has already been declared by the courts, that 'publication' is the 
communication of the defamatory matter to some third person or persons', and in 
the case of Ocampo vs Eyangelista, et al. (CA-37 Off. Gaz. 2196), it was held 
that 'to publish is to make public, to make known to the people in general.' Of 
course, there are several modes of publication, but the essence of this 
requirement is that 'the law permits us to think as badly as we please of our 
neighbors so long as we keep our uncharitable thoughts to ourselves. So, merely 
composing a libel is not actionable unless it be published. The communication of 
libelous matter to the person defamed alone does not amount to publication, for 
that cannot injure his reputation. A man's reputation is the estimate in which 
others hold him; not the good opinions which he has of himself.' (Cameron 162 
No. App. 110, 144 S. W. 171). 'The publication of a libel should not be presumed 
from the mere fact that the immediate control thereof has been parted with, 
unless it appears that there was a reasonable probability that was thereby 
exposed to be read or seen by third persons.' (The quotation continues copying" 
the same portions of the case of Lopez vs. Delgado aforequoted-2 Padilla's Revised Penal Code, Annotated, 756).</p></blockquote>
<p>The majority of the Court, however, advances the argument that in the case of 
Lopez vs. Delgado, 8 Phil., 26, a civil litigation for damages, it was held that 
the libelous matter was not published because the letter sent was "sealed", 
while in the case at bar they noticed that the letter ;was "unsealed" and to 
bolster their contention they cite the case of U.S. vs. Grino, 36 Phil., 738, as 
well as certain American authorities quoted from the Corpus Juris Secundum and 
the American Jurisprudence. So they conclude that if the sending of a letter 
"not shown to be sealed" constitute publication, the remittance of an "unsealed 
letter", as in this case, must a fortiori be held to be sufficient compliance 
with that requisite of publication. The majority of the Court has evidently 
failed to grasp the purpose and tendency of my citation of the cases of Lopez 
vs. Delgado, U.S. vs. Ramos and People vs, Atencio, supra, which are none others 
than the following: It is a fundamental principle of criminal law consecrated in 
our Bill of Rights that "in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall be 
presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved" (Art. Ill, Section 1-17 of 
the Constitution). In consonance with this constitutional mandate, our Rules of 
Court consider as a disputable presumption "that a person is innocent of crime 
or wrong" (Section 69-[a], Rule 123). Now, I have stated before and it can be 
denied by no one, that a libel is not actionable unless it be published and that 
the communication of the libclous matter to the person defamed alone does not 
amount to publication for that cannot injure his or her reputation. A person's 
reputation does not depend on the good opinion which he has of himself or 
herself, for it constitutes ,the estimate in which others hold him, so that 
publication is a necessary element of the offense of libel and lack of any 
express allegation in the complaint that the libelous matter was published, or 
of statements conducive to such averment, such as that other person or persons 
besides the offended party have read the defamatory imputations, must 
necessarily render the complaint defective, especially when that complaint does 
not state that the libel was published but merely that defendant signed, sent 
and addressed two unsealed letters to the complainant.</p>
<p>It has been held not only in the case of Lopez vs. Del-gado, but in several 
other cases, that publication of a libel shall not and cannot be presumed and 
for this reason I contend that the complaint charging any person with libel must 
assert not only that the offender parted with the custody of the libelous matter 
(even assuming that it may be so considered) under circumstances that may point 
to a reasonable probability that "it was thereby exposed to be read or seen by 
third persons", but also that they were actually seen and read by persons other 
than the offended party. To do otherwise would be tantamount to a presumption of 
something that could or could not have taken place; as for example, in the case 
at bar the sending of the unsealed letters directly to the complainant may give 
rise to the "suspicion" that other persons might have read the contents thereof, 
but can it be presumed or said that that actually happened? I appeal to the 
sense of logic of the members of this Court, and if they are unable to assure, 
as I am certain they cannot assure, that the letters in the case at bar were 
read by other persons, then they would be erroneously setting a precedent 
whereby they presumed or approved the presumption of a fact or element of the 
crime of libel that may not exist, contrary to the mandate of the Constitution 
and of the Rules of Court. And there being absolutely no allegation in the 
complaint that the letters in question were published and considering, on the 
contrary, that the complaint contains averments indicative of their 
non-publication up to the time when they were received by the complainant, I 
maintain that the Government's appeal shall be dismissed and the order appealed 
from affirmed, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
