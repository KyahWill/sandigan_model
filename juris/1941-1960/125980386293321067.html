				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a denial of a motion from reconsideration of an order of the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Zambales, dismissing&nbsp; appellant's complaint.&nbsp; The appeal has been certified to this&nbsp; Court by the&nbsp; Court of Appeals because the&nbsp; question involved is purely legal.<br><br>The complaint in question was for the recovery of two parcels of&nbsp; land which plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; he shad purchased from defendant subject to redemption within a specified&nbsp; period, but&nbsp; which&nbsp; notwithstanding&nbsp; defendant's failure to redeem within the said "period and&nbsp; despite the fact that absolute title had already passed to plaintiff, defendant,&nbsp; refused&nbsp; to deliver despite&nbsp; repeated&nbsp; demands. Answering the&nbsp; complaint, defendant&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; the sale <span style="font-style: italic;">a retro</span> but alleged as a defense that the lands in question had already been redeemed as evidenced by&nbsp; receipt signed&nbsp; by plaintiff acknowledging payment made for that purpose. Defendant also&nbsp; set up a claim for damages "by reason of the unwarranted,&nbsp; unjustified&nbsp; and malicious filing&nbsp; of this suit." &nbsp;<br><br>For failure of plantiff or his attorney to appear at the trial notwithstanding&nbsp; due notice,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; ordered the complaint dismissed and authorized the clerk of&nbsp; court&nbsp; to receive defendant's evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later,&nbsp; plaintiff moved for a reconsideration of the order of dismissal, alleging&nbsp; that the failure of himself and&nbsp; his&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; to . appear at the trial was due to the fact that the attorney's clerk, who received the notice of hearing,&nbsp; forgot to notify them thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion for reconsideration having been denied, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the order&nbsp; of denial, and this is the appeal that is now before this Court.&nbsp; , But the record&nbsp; on appeal hiss also included, by order of the .court, the decision subsequently rendered on defendant's claim, finding that the lands in question had&nbsp; already been redeemed by defendant, declaring&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; suit unjustly filed and awarding to defendant moral damages in the sum of P200 and attorney's fee in the sum of P250, in addition to the cost of suit.<br><br>We see no merit in the appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion for reconsideration, though supported&nbsp; by the affidavit&nbsp; of the clerk to the effect that, through inadvertence, she forgot to bring to the knowledge of attorney and client the&nbsp; notice of hearing that she had received, is not accompanied by an&nbsp; affidavit or&nbsp; merit, that&nbsp; is, a&nbsp; sworn declaration&nbsp; that plaintiff has a good and valid cause of action against the defendant, notwithstanding the latter's defense that he had already&nbsp; redeemed the lands in question.&nbsp; Even supposing therefore, that the failure of the plaintiff and his attorney to appear at the hearing&nbsp; was really due, as they alleged, "to excusable error or accident," still plaintiff would not be entitled to a reopening of the ease in the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; a reasonable&nbsp; assurance supported by&nbsp; proper affidavit that he had&nbsp; a just and valid cause, which, if proved, would entitle him to a judgment in his favor.&nbsp; (Remedios M. Vda. de Miranda <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Urbano Legaspi&nbsp; et al.,&nbsp; 92 Phil.,&nbsp; 290,&nbsp; 48&nbsp; Off. Gaz., 4819.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the circumstances, the&nbsp; lower court did not commit any&nbsp; error or&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; its&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; in denying a reopening. <br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; order appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
