				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from a decision&nbsp; of the court&nbsp; of first instance of Camarines Sur dismissing appellant's petition whereby he&nbsp; sought reinstatement to&nbsp; the position of detective of the Naga Police and Fire Department of the City of Naga. On April&nbsp; 14, 1953, appellant&nbsp; was appointed by Mayor Leon Sa.&nbsp; Aureus&nbsp; as detective in&nbsp; the&nbsp; Naga Police Force and Fire&nbsp; Department, with&nbsp; a&nbsp; compensation of&nbsp; P1,140 per annum, effective April 16, 1953.&nbsp; Prior to his appointment, he was a clerk-typist in the office of the&nbsp; Social Welfare Council of Naga.&nbsp; He has no civil service eligibility, so his appointments&nbsp; in said positions were of temporary character.<br><br>On January 31, 1954, and&nbsp; in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp; with Sec. 682 of the&nbsp; Revised Administrative&nbsp; Code,&nbsp; appellant was relieved from service by City Mayor Antonio P.&nbsp; Sibulo.&nbsp; On February 2, 1954, appellant, in a communication&nbsp; to the Honorable,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Executive&nbsp; Secretary,&nbsp; requested for the commutation of his vacation and&nbsp; sick leave,&nbsp; which was granted, and for which he was paid the sum corresponding to 54 days of service.<br><br>On August 18, 1954,&nbsp; appellant commenced&nbsp; this action against the City Treasurer and the City Mayor of Naga City to compel them to&nbsp; reinstate ljim as detective of the Naga City Police and Fire Department, effective February 1st,&nbsp; 1954,&nbsp; and to secure payment of back salary to be counted&nbsp; from that date.&nbsp; Respondents-appellees,&nbsp; answering the petition, alleged that appellant was merely a temporary employee for lack of civil service&nbsp; eligibility; that he was legally&nbsp; separated from service by Mayor Sibulo in accordance with Sec. 682 of the Revised Administrative Code, and therefore he has no right to be reinstated nor to&nbsp; demand&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of back salary.&nbsp; The&nbsp; lower court upheld the contention of respondents-appellees, hence the appeal.<br><br>There is no dispute that appellant is not a civil service eligible,&nbsp; and that his appointment was&nbsp; never&nbsp; approved by the Commissioner of Civil Service.&nbsp; Neither&nbsp; is there proof that his appointment as detective was of permanent nature.&nbsp; Obviously, such appointment should necessarily be considered temporary,&nbsp; as&nbsp; only civil&nbsp; service&nbsp; eligibles are entitled&nbsp; to&nbsp; a permanent appointment.&nbsp; Consequently, the lower court correctly&nbsp; dismissed the case,&nbsp; and in this instance we find no reason for disturbing such dismissal. Appellant, however, contends&nbsp; that&nbsp; under Republic Act No. 557 he&nbsp; cannot be dismissed without just cause and without proper investigation, further invoking our ruling in the case of Antonio Uy <i>vs.</i> Jose Rodriguez, 95 Phil., 493; 50 Off. Gaz., [8] S574, as reiterated in the case of Olegario <i>vs.</i> Lacson, 97 Phil. 75. Appellant argues that under the provisions of R. A. 557&nbsp; and the doctrine 'laid dowm in these two cases, his dismissal was illegal because his appointment was not temporary,&nbsp; despite the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that he has&nbsp; no civil service eligibility, for his salary is on a yearly basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention is not well taken, for the doctrine laid down in the above cases refers to detectives whose appointments were permanent in character; thus, in the Uy case, we held that "unless it is shown that a detective's appointment was temporary, he may not be dismissed except in accordance with Republic Act No. 557."&nbsp; This ruling was reiterated in the case of Olegario <i>vs.</i> Lacson, <i>supra</i> the facts of which are similar&nbsp; to the Uy case.&nbsp; In the case at bar,&nbsp; however, it is admitted by the appellant that he has no civil service eligibility, hence his appointment could not be permanent in&nbsp; nature,&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; permanent appointment implies civil service eligibility.&nbsp; And in the case of Orais, et&nbsp; al., <i>vs.</i> Ribo, et al., 93 Phil., 985; 49 Off. Gaz., No. 12, pp. 53865393, we held that persons appointed under sec. 682 of the Revised&nbsp; Administrative&nbsp; Code could be replaced at&nbsp; any time, after three months from the date of their appointment.<br><br>As to appellant's contention that his appointment should be&nbsp; considered as permanent because&nbsp; the salary&nbsp; stated therein is on a&nbsp; yearly&nbsp; basis, suffice&nbsp; it to&nbsp; say&nbsp; that the phrase "per annum" appearing in the appointment does not make the same permanent, but is placed there&nbsp; merely for budgetary purposes.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from&nbsp; is hereby affirmed.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ</i>., concur.<br></div>
