				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Dante Capuno, son&nbsp; of&nbsp; Delfin Capuno, was accused of double&nbsp; homicide&nbsp; through reckless&nbsp; imprudence&nbsp; for the death of Isidoro&nbsp; Caperina and Amado Ticzon on March 31,&nbsp; 1949 in the Court of First Instance of Laguna (Criminal&nbsp; Case No. 15001).&nbsp; During the trial,&nbsp; Sabina Exconde, as mother of the deceased Isidoro Caperina,&nbsp; reserved her right to bring a separate&nbsp; civil action for damages against the accused.&nbsp; After trial,&nbsp; Dante Capuno was found guilty of the crime charged and, on appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision.&nbsp; Dante&nbsp; Capuno was&nbsp; only fifteen (15)&nbsp; years old when he committed the crime.<br><br>In line with her&nbsp; reservation, Sabina Exconde filed the present&nbsp; action against Delfin Capuno&nbsp; and&nbsp; his son Dante Capuno asking for&nbsp; damages&nbsp; in the aggregate amount of P2,959.00 for the death of her son Isidoro Caperina.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants set up the defense that if any one should be held liable for the&nbsp; death of&nbsp; Isidoro Caperifia,&nbsp; he&nbsp; is Dante Capuno&nbsp; and not his father Delfin&nbsp; because&nbsp; at the time of the accident, the former was&nbsp; not under the control, supervision and custody&nbsp; of the latter.&nbsp; This defense was sustained&nbsp; by the&nbsp; lower court and, as a consequence,&nbsp; it only convicted&nbsp; Dante Capuno to pay the damages claimed in the complaint.&nbsp; From this decision, plaintiff appeal.<br><br>It appears that Dante&nbsp; Capuno&nbsp; was a&nbsp; member of the Boy Scouts Organization and a student of the Balintawak Elementary&nbsp; School&nbsp; situated&nbsp; in a&nbsp; barrio&nbsp; in&nbsp; the City of San Pablo and on March 31, 1949 he attended a parade in honor of Dr. Jose Rizal in&nbsp; said city upon instruction of the city school's supervisor.&nbsp; From the school Dante, with other students,&nbsp; boarded a&nbsp; jeep&nbsp; and when the&nbsp; same started to&nbsp; run,&nbsp; he took hold&nbsp; of the wheel&nbsp; and drove it while&nbsp; the&nbsp; driver&nbsp; sat on&nbsp; his&nbsp; left&nbsp; side.&nbsp; They have not gone far&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; jeep&nbsp; turned&nbsp; turtle&nbsp; and&nbsp; two of&nbsp; its passengers, Amado Ticzon&nbsp; and Isidoro Caperiiia, died as a&nbsp; consequence.&nbsp;&nbsp; It further appears that&nbsp; Delfin Capuno, father.<br><br>The only issue involved&nbsp; in this appeal&nbsp; is whether defendant Delfin Capuno can be&nbsp; held civilly liable,&nbsp; jointly and severally with his son Dante, for damages&nbsp; resulting from the death&nbsp; of Isidoro Caperifla&nbsp; caused by&nbsp; the&nbsp; negligent&nbsp; act of&nbsp; minor Dante&nbsp; Capuno.<br><br>The case comes under&nbsp; Article&nbsp; 1903&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Spanish Civil Code, paragraph 1 and 5,&nbsp; which provides:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1903. The1 obligation imposed by the next preceding1 articles is&nbsp; enforceable not&nbsp; only for personal&nbsp; acts and omissions, but also for those of&nbsp; persons for whom another is responsible.<br><br>The father, and,&nbsp; in&nbsp; case of his death or incapacity, the mother, are liable&nbsp; for&nbsp; any damages caused&nbsp; by the minor children who live&nbsp; with them.<br><br><center> *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * </center><br>Finally,&nbsp; teachers or directors of arts and trades are liable&nbsp; for any&nbsp; damages caused&nbsp; by their pupils or&nbsp; apprentices while they are under&nbsp; their custody."</blockquote>Plaintiff contends that defendant Delfin Capuno is&nbsp; liable for the damages&nbsp; in question jointly and severally with his son&nbsp; Dante&nbsp; because at the time&nbsp; the latter committed the negligent&nbsp; act which resulted&nbsp; in&nbsp; the death of&nbsp; the victim, he&nbsp; was a minor and was then&nbsp; living&nbsp; with&nbsp; his father, and inasmuch as these facts are&nbsp; not disputed,&nbsp; the&nbsp; civil liability of the&nbsp; father is evident.&nbsp;&nbsp; And&nbsp; so, plaintiff contends,&nbsp; the lower court erred in relieving the father&nbsp; from liability.<br><br>We find merit&nbsp; in&nbsp; this&nbsp; claim.&nbsp; It is true that&nbsp; under the law above quoted, "teachers&nbsp; or directors of arts&nbsp; and trades are liable for&nbsp; any damages&nbsp; caused&nbsp; by their&nbsp; pupils or apprentices while&nbsp; they arc under their custody",&nbsp; but this&nbsp; provision only applies to an institution of arts&nbsp; and trades and not to any&nbsp; academic&nbsp; educational&nbsp; institution (Padilla,&nbsp; Civil Law,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; Ed.,&nbsp; Vol. IV,&nbsp; p. 841; See 12 Manresa,&nbsp; 4th Ed., p.&nbsp; 557).&nbsp; Here&nbsp; Dante&nbsp; Capuno&nbsp; was then a student of&nbsp; the Balintawak Elementary School&nbsp; and as part of his extra-curricular activity, he attended&nbsp; the parade in honor of Dr.&nbsp; Jose Rizal upon instruction&nbsp; of the city&nbsp; school's&nbsp; supervisor.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was in connection with that.<br><br>The&nbsp; civil&nbsp; liability which&nbsp; the law&nbsp; impose&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the father, and, in case of his death or&nbsp; incapacity, the mother, for any damages that may be caused by the minor children who&nbsp; live&nbsp; with&nbsp; them, is&nbsp; obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; is&nbsp; a necessary consequence&nbsp; of the parental authority&nbsp; they&nbsp; exercise over them which&nbsp; imposes&nbsp; upon the parents the "duty of supporting them, keeping them in their company, educating them and instructing them in proportion to&nbsp; their means", while, on&nbsp; the other hand, gives them the "right to correct and&nbsp; punish them&nbsp; in&nbsp; moderation" (Articles&nbsp; 154 and&nbsp; 155, Spanish Civil Code).&nbsp; The only&nbsp; way&nbsp; by which they&nbsp; can relieve themselves&nbsp; of this liability&nbsp; is if they prove that.<br><br>Wherefore, the decision appealed&nbsp; from is modified&nbsp; in the sense that defendants Delfin Capuno&nbsp; and Dante Capuno shall&nbsp; pay to plaintiff, jointly and severally, the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P2,959.00 as damages, and the costs of action.<br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Labrador,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Endencia,&nbsp; JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Paras, C.

L., J.;</i><br><br>After&nbsp; mature consideration I believe we should affirm the judgment relieving the father of liability.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; can see no sound reason for limiting Art.&nbsp; 1903 of the old Civil Code&nbsp; to&nbsp; teachers of arts and trades and not to academic ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; What substantial difference is&nbsp; there between them in so&nbsp; far as concerns the proper supervision and vigilance over their pupils?&nbsp; It cannot be seriously contended that an academic teacher is&nbsp; exempt&nbsp; from the duty of&nbsp; watching that&nbsp; his pupils do not commit a tort to the detriment of third&nbsp; persons,&nbsp; so long as they are&nbsp; in&nbsp; a position to exercise&nbsp; authority and supervision&nbsp; over&nbsp; the&nbsp; pupil.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; my opinion,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the phrase&nbsp; "teachers&nbsp; or&nbsp; heads of&nbsp; establishments of arts and trades" used in Art. 1903 of the Old Civil Code. the word "arts and trades" does not qualify "teachers" but only head of establishments". The Phrase is only an updated version of the equivalent terms "preceptores y artesanos" used in the Italian and French Codes.<br><br>If,&nbsp; as&nbsp; conceded&nbsp; by&nbsp; all commentators, the basis&nbsp; of the presumption of negligence of Art. 1903 in&nbsp; some <i>culpti in vigilando</i> that&nbsp; the&nbsp; parents, teachers, etc.&nbsp; are&nbsp; supposed to have&nbsp; incurred&nbsp; in the exercise of their authority, it would seem&nbsp; clear that where the parent places&nbsp; the&nbsp; child under the effective authority of the teacher,&nbsp; the&nbsp; latter, and not the parent, should&nbsp; be&nbsp; the one&nbsp; answerable for the torts committed while under&nbsp; his&nbsp; custody, for the very&nbsp; reason that the&nbsp; parent is&nbsp; not supposed&nbsp; to interfere with the discipline of the&nbsp; school nor with&nbsp; the authority and supervision of the teacher while the child is under instruction. And if there is no authority, there can be no responsibility.<br><br>In the case&nbsp; before&nbsp; us,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is&nbsp; no question that&nbsp; the pupil, Dante&nbsp; Capuno, was instructed by the&nbsp; City&nbsp; School Supervisor&nbsp; to&nbsp; attend the Rizal parade.&nbsp; His father could not&nbsp; properly&nbsp; refuse to&nbsp; allow the child&nbsp; to&nbsp; attend,&nbsp; in&nbsp; defiance of the&nbsp; school authorities.&nbsp; The father&nbsp; had&nbsp; every reason to&nbsp; assume&nbsp; that&nbsp; in&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; a minor to attend&nbsp; a parade with other&nbsp; children,&nbsp; the&nbsp; school&nbsp; authorities would provide adequate supervision over them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a teacher or scout master&nbsp; was present,&nbsp; then he should be the&nbsp; one&nbsp; responsible for allowing the minor to drive the jeep without being qualified to do so.&nbsp; On the other hand, if no&nbsp; teacher or&nbsp; master&nbsp; was&nbsp; at&nbsp; hand to&nbsp; watch&nbsp; over the&nbsp; pupil, the school authorities are the one answerable for that negligence, and not the father.<br><br>At any&nbsp; rate,&nbsp; I&nbsp; submit that the&nbsp; father&nbsp; should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be held liable for a tort that he was in no way able&nbsp; to prevent, and which he had every right to assume the school authorities would avoid.&nbsp; Having proved that he entrusted his child&nbsp; to the custody of&nbsp; school authorities&nbsp; that were competent&nbsp; to&nbsp; exercise vigilance over him, the&nbsp; father has rebutted the presumption of&nbsp; Art. 1903 and the burden&nbsp; of proof shifted to the claimant to&nbsp; show&nbsp; actual&nbsp; negligence on the part of the&nbsp; parent&nbsp; in order&nbsp; to&nbsp; render him liable. <br><br><i>Padilla </i>and <i>Reyes, A., JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
