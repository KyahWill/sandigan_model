				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">As owner of 200 boxes of canned milk placed on board the <em>S. S. Daniel R. 
Hill</em> for transportation from New Orleans, U. S. A. to Cebu City, plaintiff 
Go Chan &amp; Co., Inc. sued defendant as the agent of said vessel. The 
complaint alleged that in February, 1947 such cargo was delivered to it minus 24 
cases; and that the value of the shortage was P416.68, for which judgment was 
accordingly requested.
<p>The defendant answered that the loss was due to a peril of the sea, and that 
anyway the action was barred because more than one year had elapsed from 
February 1947 to May 1950 when the complaint was filed.</p>
<p>The court of first instance of Cebu rendered judgment for the plaintiff, upon 
the following facts, which it found to have been established:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"* * * that the plaintiff shipped 240 cases of milk and the corresponding 
freight was paid; that the cargo was transhipped on the <em>S. S. Snug 
Hitch</em> and arrived at the port of Cebu in 1947 with 24 cases short-landed; 
that a timely claim for the short-landed cargo of 24 cases was presented by the 
plaintiff to the defendant but the latter asked to defer the claim; that when, 
the 24 cases arrived, Go Tiong, the General Manager of the plaintiff corporation 
did not receive them because they were no longer in cases but in sakes, and that 
the cans were no longer fit for human consumption— they were damaged and rusty; 
that the delay in payment was due to the request of the defendant for amicable 
settlement which later, the defendant refused to pay. (Record on Appeal, p. 9) 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Concerning the defendant's plea of prescription, founded on Commonwealth Act 
No. 65 adopting <em>in toto</em> the Act of the U. S. Congress known as Carriage 
of Goods by Sea Act, the Cebu court declared that both laws did not modify our 
statute of limitations, Act 190, under which, actions of this nature prescribed 
in four years.</p>
<p>Having failed in a motion to reconsider, defendant perfected its appeal—which 
we find to be meritorious.</p>
<p>In Chua Kuy <em>vs</em>. Everett Steamship Corporation, [93 Phil., 207, 50 
Off. Gaz, (1), p. 159] involving a similar controversy, we ruled that the 
prescriptive period of one year established in the Carriage of foods by Sea Act 
modified <em>pro tanto</em> the provisions of Act No. 190 as to goods 
transported to and from Philippine ports in foreign trade (trade with U. S. is 
now foreign). Said American Act provides as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability 
in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought <em>within one year after 
delivery of the goods</em> or the date when the goods should have been 
delivered; provided, that if a notice of loss or damage, either apparent or 
concealed, is not given aa provided for in this section, that fact shall not 
affect or prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year after 
the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been 
delivered." (Subsec. 6, sec. 3, Title I) (Italics ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Thru Mr. Justice Bautista Angelo this Court explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The claim that the prescriptive period to be considered in this case is that 
embodied in the Code of Civil Procedure is untenable for the simple reason that 
this is a general law which only applies to cases not covered by any special 
act. As we have already stated, the transaction under consideration is covered 
by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, and since this is a special act, its 
provisions muat of necessity limit or restrict a law of general application. To 
hold otherwise would be to render nugatory the prescriptive provision contained 
in that special act."</p></blockquote>
<p>Because this action was not filed within one year from February, 1947 when 
the cargo was delivered or should have been delivered, the law discharged this 
defendant from all liability in connection with the carriage of said goods. The 
judgment will therefore he reversed and the defendant absolved, with costs 
against appellees. So ordered.</p>

and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
