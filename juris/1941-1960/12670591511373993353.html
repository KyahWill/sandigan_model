				G.R. No. L-1305, June 24, 1949</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BERNABE GALO, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>MORAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Bernabe Galo has been convicted of treason by the Third 
Division of the People's Court, and sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with 
the accessories of the law, to a fine of P10,000, and to pay the costs. From 
this judgment he appealed to this Court.
<p align="justify">The facts proven by at least two witnesses are as follows:</p>
<p align="justify">On May 23, 1943, the herein appellant, together with Japanese 
and constabulary soldiers, went to the respective houses of Jose Quevedo, Juan 
Baldos, and Teofilo Duran, in the barrio of Cari√±gayan, municipality of Manaoag, 
Province of Pangasinan, and brought them down for investigation as to their 
guerilla activities. Upon their refusal to disclose their connection with the 
resistance movement, he maltreated them in the following manner: Jose Quevedo 
was hit with fist blows and later was made to lie down on his back and water 
from a jar was poured on his face, mouth and nose by appellant until the jar was 
emptied. Juan Baldos suffered a similar torture and Teofilo Duran received a 
blow on his jaw, all from appellant's hands. These facts were testified to by 
Jose Quevedo, Juan Baldos, and Geronimo Quevedo. Appellant admitted his presence 
at the time these punishments were inflicted but denied any participation 
therein. </p>
<p align="justify">On July 2, 1944, accompanied by two members of the police force 
of Manaoag, Pangasinan, and by eight Japanese soldiers, appellant went to the 
house of Antonio Repoldo, a guerilla officer, in the Barrio of San Juan, 
Municipality of San Manuel, Province of Pangasinan. He slapped the face of 
Antonio Repoldo thrice, tied his hands behind his back, brought him downstairs 
to a guava grove nearby, and forced him to dip his face in a basin of water. 
Then he asked Repoldo whether he was a member of the guerrillas, pointing his 
pistol at him, and upon his refusal to admit his guilt, Repoldo was hanged by 
his hands which were tied behind his back, to a sampaloc tree and he was whipped 
by appellant. As he insisted upon his refusal, he was again beaten by appellant 
in a place near a Japanese garrison. A week later he was released. There are 
three witnesses who testified to these facts, namely, Antonio Repoldo, Maria 
Quiniones and Dominador Soriano. Appellant admitted his presence at the arrest 
and torture of Repoldo, but denied any participation therein.</p>
<p align="justify">On February 23, 1944, Tomas Velasquez, a guerrilla leader in 
Manaoag, Pangasinan, was arrested by the chief of police accompanied by 
appellant and was taken to the municipal jail of Manaoag. He was taken later, 
with others, by Japanese soldiers to Dagupan, Pangasinan, where he was 
maltreated. Tomas Velasquez and Vicente Velasquez testified to these facts.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant's membership in the police force of Manaoag does not 
in itself constitute treason; but his having accompanied the Japanese soldiers 
to the places of abode of guerrilla leaders and the several illtreatments which 
he personally inflicted upon them because of their refusal to disclose their 
connection with the guerrilla forces, constitute treason.</p>
<p align="justify">Appellant's allegation that he was forced by Japanese soldiers 
to accompany them, cannot be accepted considering the acts of violence which he 
himself personally performed and which conclusively show his alliance with the 
Japanese forces.</p>
<p align="justify">For all the foregoing, the judgment is affirmed with costs 
against appellant.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Perfecto, Bengzon, Tuason, 
Montemayor,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</p>
<p align="justify">MORAN, C. J.:</p> Mr. Justice Pablo voted for affirmance.</div>
