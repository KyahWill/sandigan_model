				<H3>MANILA TOBACCO ASSOCIATION, INC., PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS.  THE CITY OF MANILA, AND M. SARMIENTO, IN HIS CAPACITY  AS  CITY  TREASURER  OF THE  CITY OF  MANILA, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLEES.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailing the&nbsp; validity of Ordinance No.&nbsp; 3634&nbsp; of the City of Manila and the Regulations complementary thereto, the plaintiff&nbsp; association composed&nbsp; of manufacturers of or dealers in cigars, cigarrettes and&nbsp; other tobacco products filed this action&nbsp; for declaratory relief in the Manila Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance, asking for their annulment in so far as&nbsp; they affected its business activities.<br><br>The defendants opposed the request, asserted the City's power to&nbsp; tax and pleaded for dismissal of the complaint.<br><br>The Hon. Rafael Amparo, Judge, after hearing the parties dismissed the case.&nbsp; Wherefore this appeal perfected in due time.<br><br>The ordinance&nbsp; in question imposes a municipal&nbsp; tax on those "engaging&nbsp; in the&nbsp; business&nbsp; as wholesale dealer in general merchandise," and provides that "the term 'general merchandise' shall include all articles subject to the payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; percentage&nbsp; taxes,&nbsp; graduated&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; taxes&nbsp; and specific taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall also include poultry and livestock, fish and other allied products."<br><br>This ordinance amended Ordinance No. 3420 imposing the same&nbsp; tax,&nbsp; but expressly excluding from the definition of&nbsp; "general&nbsp; merchandise" all articles <i>subject to the *payment of specific taxes</i> under the&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code. Inasmuch as cigars and cigarrettes are subject to&nbsp; specific taxes, the&nbsp; amended&nbsp; ordinance necessarily touched the pockets of cigar dealers and merchants.&nbsp; Hence this suit, resting on the proposition that although the City of Manila has, by its Charter&nbsp; (Republic&nbsp; Act 409, Sec.&nbsp; 18,&nbsp; par.&nbsp; O) power to tax dealers&nbsp; in general merchandise the term "general merchandise" does not include dealer in articles— like cigars—s<i>ubject to specific&nbsp; taxes.</i><br><br>The text;of such legislative authority reads as&nbsp; follows:<br><blockquote>"(o) To tax and fix the license fee&nbsp; on dealers in general merchandise, including&nbsp; importers and indentors, except those dealers who may be expressly subject to the payment of some other municipal tax, under the provisions of this section,"<br><br>"Dealers in general merchandise shall be classified as (a)&nbsp; whole- sale dealers and (6)&nbsp; classified into four main classes:* * *."<br><br>"For purposes of this&nbsp; section,&nbsp; the&nbsp; term&nbsp; 'General&nbsp; merchandise' shall include poultry&nbsp; and&nbsp; livestock, agricultural&nbsp; products, fish and other allied products."</blockquote>Inviting particular attention to the last paragraph, the plaintiff association presents an argument&nbsp; which, in&nbsp; short, amounts&nbsp; to&nbsp; this:&nbsp; Except&nbsp; for this paragraph&nbsp; the&nbsp; word "general&nbsp; merchandise"&nbsp; would&nbsp; not have included&nbsp; poultry and livestock, etc.; the latter would not have been included, because&nbsp; they were&nbsp; exempt from&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; taxes ordinarily paid by merchants&nbsp; (like percentage taxes) by virtue of Sec. 188 of the National Revenue&nbsp; Code; therefore other articles&nbsp; exempt&nbsp; under&nbsp; sec.&nbsp; 188—like&nbsp; cigars— are not&nbsp; included within the scope of&nbsp; the word&nbsp; "general merchandise."<br><br>The reasoning although clever, can not stand a separate examination&nbsp; of its&nbsp; component propositions.&nbsp; The first can not fully be accepted; poultry is "merchandise or personal property or whatever character."&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legislature might have made express reference to poultry and livestock out of extreme caution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">1</sup>&nbsp; in a needless&nbsp; effort to make comprehensive the scope of the term.<br><br>However, admitting the validity&nbsp; of such proposition, we find no indication&nbsp; that poultry and livestock would have been excluded from&nbsp; the term simply&nbsp; because&nbsp; of section 188.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appellant quotes&nbsp; no authority to support such second proposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for their express mention lay in their very nature, the possibility that, as living or growing objects, they&nbsp; might not be regarded&nbsp; as merchandise.<br><br>And other articles subject to specific taxes—like cigars, matches and firecrackers—were not expressly included because there was no&nbsp; such possibility. If the Legislature had intended not to include&nbsp; articles subject&nbsp; to specific taxes in the power to tax granted to the City of Manila, it would have said so clearly, as it did&nbsp; in&nbsp; Commonwealth Act No. 472 when it ordered, the municipal councils shall have no power to impose "specific taxes," nor taxes "on the business of * * * tobacco dealers etc."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sees. 1 and 3)<br><br>Petitioner asks, why&nbsp; should cities&nbsp; like Manila be permitted to tax goods that other municipalities cannot tax? The answer is easy to find:&nbsp;&nbsp; The need for greater revenue, in view of&nbsp; the City's expanded&nbsp; services and activities.<br><br>The other argument of&nbsp; appellant runs along&nbsp; this line: "Dealers&nbsp; in general merchandise" are, ordinarily, merchants; merchants under the Internal Revenue&nbsp; Code pay fixed&nbsp; and percentage taxes; consequently "general merchandise" should mean articles subject to fixed and percentage taxes—not&nbsp; those subject to specific taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; This process of reasoning does&nbsp; not sound convincing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">2</sup>; in fact, it is inconclusive, for it does assert as a premise— it cannot&nbsp; assert—that&nbsp; merchants <i>do&nbsp; not pay</i> specific&nbsp; taxes. Logically, from the two premises above stated the inference should be: dealers in general merchandise pay&nbsp; fixed and percentage taxes.<br><br>Furthermore, appellant itself&nbsp; admits to a difference between&nbsp; "dealer" and "merchant" in the&nbsp; light of internal revenue laws; and the City Charter speaks of "dealers."<br><br>As&nbsp; a result we perceive&nbsp; no valid&nbsp; reason to&nbsp; bestow on the term "general merchandise," any&nbsp; other meaning than the ordinary one, which includes all articles usually bought and sold in trade&nbsp; (40 Corpus&nbsp; Juris p. 641-642)&nbsp; either wholesale or retail&nbsp; (Bouvier's&nbsp; Law Dictionary Vol. II- 2195.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Cigars and&nbsp; cigarrettes are unquestionably of that kind; therefore dealers in cigars and cigarrettes are dealers in general&nbsp; merchandise,&nbsp; subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; tax&nbsp; under&nbsp; the&nbsp; City Charter and the Ordinance.<br><br>A second point remains to be considered.&nbsp; Implementing the Ordinance in question the City Treasurer issued&nbsp; Regulations which provide, among other things, that "wholesale 2 One might as&nbsp; well argue:&nbsp; Merchants pay real&nbsp; estate taxes; consequently "general&nbsp; merchandise" means real estate dealers" shall include "manufacturers in Manila who conduct the business of selling their own products at wholesale at places in the City other than their factories"&nbsp; *&nbsp; * *.<br><br>This&nbsp; is&nbsp; erroneous,&nbsp; suggests the&nbsp; association, because "manufacturers" are&nbsp; not&nbsp; "dealers,"&nbsp; "manufacturers&nbsp; of cigars"&nbsp; differ from&nbsp; "wholesale tobacco dealers"; and the Charter authorized no tax on manufacturers.&nbsp; It relies on Central Azucarera Don Pedro&nbsp; vs. City of Manila8 wherein this Court&nbsp; held that "the mere fact that&nbsp; a manufacturer sells&nbsp; the Sugar that&nbsp; it&nbsp; manufactures does not thereby make it a dealer in sugar."&nbsp; Precisely, that case also holds that such manufacturer becomes a&nbsp; dealer&nbsp; if he carries on the business of selling his goods or his products at a store or warehouse apart&nbsp; from his&nbsp; own&nbsp; shop or manufactory.<br><br>The order of dismissal is therefore affirmed with costs against appellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
