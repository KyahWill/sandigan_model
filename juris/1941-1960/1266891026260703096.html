				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal by&nbsp; petitioner Ang Bun Phek,&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">alias </span>Kun Pue Guan, an applicant&nbsp; for naturalization, from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila,&nbsp; denying his application.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the hearing where the Solicitor General appeared on behalf of the&nbsp; Republic of the&nbsp; Philippines, the trial court&nbsp; made the&nbsp; following findings of fact to which the Solicitor General&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; brief agrees:<br><blockquote>"Petitioner Ang Bun Phek was&nbsp; born in Ang Chu, Amoy,&nbsp; China, on&nbsp; August 5, 1928.&nbsp; He came to the Philippines&nbsp; on&nbsp; board the S/S TJISATANE in July, 1937, with his mother Tan Cho Kim <i>alias</i> Luy Ni,&nbsp; as son of merchant, Ang&nbsp; Chay&nbsp; Hok, already dead;&nbsp; and has resided continuously in the Philippines&nbsp; already for at least ten years, and has never left the Philippines. In 1938, he began to use the alias name&nbsp; of Kun Pue Guan. He is a salesman at Hua Hing Trading Co., Manila, with a salary&nbsp; of P250.00 a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is married to Constancia Lee, a .Chinese, born&nbsp; in Manila&nbsp; on&nbsp; August 29, 1930 (Exh. D), with whom he has&nbsp; three daughters, named Virginia Kun, born February 5, 1955, Manila; Vivian Lee Kun, born&nbsp; February 4, 1956, Manila, and&nbsp; Veronica L. Kun,&nbsp; born February 9, 1957, (Exhs. K, K-1 and K-2).&nbsp; Petitioner and his wife and&nbsp; child ren are all&nbsp; provided with corresponding alien certificates of registration (Exhs. M, Q, R, R-1 and&nbsp; R-2.)&nbsp; Besides the Chinese language, petitioner&nbsp; can speak and&nbsp; write&nbsp; English and Tagalog (Exhs. S).&nbsp; He filed income tax returns for 1954, 1955 and 1956 and has no outstanding internal revenue tax obligation (Exhs. E, E-l, E-2 and&nbsp; G).&nbsp; He is of good moral character, and has not&nbsp; been&nbsp; prosecuted or convicted of any offense (Exhs. H, H-1,&nbsp; 0, 0-1&nbsp; and 0-13), except for violation of ordinance in 1947, for placing garbage can early&nbsp; on sidewalk.&nbsp; During the entire period of his residence&nbsp; in the Philippines,&nbsp; he has conducted himself in a&nbsp; proper&nbsp; and irreproachable&nbsp; manner in his relation with the constituted&nbsp; authorities as well as with the community wherein he&nbsp; lives.&nbsp; (Exhs. 0, 0-1, to 0-13).&nbsp; He believes in the principles underlying the Philippine Constitution, and is not opposed to organized government, or affiliated with any organization&nbsp; which upholds and teaches&nbsp; doctrines opposing all organized governments, or which advocates or&nbsp; defends the necessity or propriety of violence, personal assault, or assassination for the success and&nbsp; predominance&nbsp; of men's ideas.&nbsp; He is not a polygamist or a believer in&nbsp; the practice&nbsp; of polygamy. He is not suffering from mental alienation or incurable contagious&nbsp; disease (Exh. P). He has always mingled socially with&nbsp; Filipinos, and&nbsp; has shown a sincere desire to learn and embrace the customs, traditions and ideals&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Filipinos.&nbsp; He is&nbsp; a subject&nbsp; of&nbsp; Nationalist&nbsp; China (Exhs. H and H-l) with which the Philippines is not at war, and the&nbsp; laws of which grant Filipinos the&nbsp; right to become naturalized citizens thereof."<br></blockquote>The main reason of the trial&nbsp; court&nbsp; in denying&nbsp; the application&nbsp; is contained in the portion&nbsp; of its&nbsp; decision which we&nbsp; reproduce below:<br><blockquote>"Despite all&nbsp; the facts&nbsp; abovementioned,&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; feel free to act&nbsp; favorably upon&nbsp; the herein petition for the reason that the&nbsp; petitioner has&nbsp; not satisfactorily&nbsp; established&nbsp; lawful&nbsp; entry for permanent residence in the Philippines, as&nbsp; required by Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law (C.A.&nbsp; No. 473). His bare testimony that upon&nbsp; his&nbsp; arrival in Manila&nbsp; in&nbsp; July, 1937,&nbsp; he was issued&nbsp; a Landing Certificate of&nbsp; Residence in the name of&nbsp; "Ang Bun Phek", and that said&nbsp; document&nbsp; was&nbsp; lost in&nbsp; 1942&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp; Japanese occupation&nbsp; is&nbsp; not only not&nbsp; reliable&nbsp; but&nbsp; doubtful. Petitioner declared&nbsp; that he came to the&nbsp; Islands with the&nbsp; mother Tan&nbsp; Cho Kun alias Luy&nbsp; Ni, in&nbsp; July, 1937,&nbsp; at the&nbsp; age&nbsp; of&nbsp; 9 years, but he did not present his&nbsp; said mother to&nbsp; corroborate his testimony notwithstanding the fact that he was given opportunity&nbsp; to do so."<br></blockquote>The record, however,&nbsp; in&nbsp; our opinion, sufficiently establishes&nbsp; applicant's lawful entry&nbsp; for&nbsp; permanent&nbsp; residence here.&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with said lawful&nbsp; entry of petitioner for permanent residence in the Philippines&nbsp; as&nbsp; required in Section 6 of the Revised Naturalization Law, the&nbsp; Solicitor General on page 5 of his brief, says&nbsp; the following:<br><blockquote>"* *&nbsp; *.&nbsp; To establish&nbsp; his&nbsp; lawful entry, petitioner&nbsp; presented in evidence immigration Certificate of Residence No. 3104, dated March 23,&nbsp; 1946 (Exh. 'M-l', p. 21,&nbsp; Folder of Exhibits), the&nbsp; Certificate of Arrival, dated June 10, 1954&nbsp; (Exh. 'L' p. 19, Folder&nbsp; of Exhibits), the Alien&nbsp; Certificate of&nbsp; Registration&nbsp; dated&nbsp; July 14, 1950&nbsp; (Exh. 'M', p.&nbsp; 20, Folder of Exhibits), and the Certificate of the Bureau of Immigration to the effect&nbsp; that in the 1941 Master&nbsp; List&nbsp; of registered&nbsp; aliens on&nbsp; file in&nbsp; said&nbsp; office,&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of Ang Bun Phek appears <br></blockquote>The above described documents satisfy the requirements of the law as to&nbsp; entry and residence.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Maxwell Tong <i>vs.</i> Republic of the Philippines, G. R. No. L-9728, promulgated January 21, 1958, where the trial court denied the petition for naturalization, this Tribunal, through Mr. Justice Bengzon, said:<br><blockquote>"We think the denial was erroneous.&nbsp; The dubious certificate (Certificate of the&nbsp; Deputy Commissioner, Bureau of Immigration to the effect&nbsp; that according to the records, the petitioner was lawfully admitted into the Philippines) was only one of the several certificates submitted by petitioner. The&nbsp; Immigrant Certificate&nbsp; of Residence&nbsp; introduced&nbsp; at the hearing as Exhibit&nbsp; L-5&nbsp; is quite conclusive.&nbsp; Dated&nbsp; March&nbsp; 11, 1956, and&nbsp; signed&nbsp; by Alfredo&nbsp; Catolico, First Deputy Commissioner of Immigration, it certifies that herein applicant, then 27&nbsp; years old, 'was admitted as an immigrant at the port of Manila&nbsp; and is&nbsp; lawfully entitled&nbsp; to remain in the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; Surely, no&nbsp; better testimonial could have&nbsp; been produced&nbsp; on his right&nbsp; to stay here."&nbsp;&nbsp; (P.&nbsp; 2, Decision on&nbsp; the Petition for Naturalization of&nbsp; Maxwell Tong.)<br></blockquote>Even the Solicitor General representing the Government apparently agrees to our opinion as to petitioner-appellant's having&nbsp; established&nbsp; his&nbsp; lawful entry for permanent residence.&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp; copying the same portion of&nbsp; our&nbsp; decision in the Maxwell&nbsp; Tong case (<span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>), as&nbsp; we&nbsp; have&nbsp; above-reproduced, said Solicitor General says on pp. 6-7&nbsp; of his brief: <br><blockquote>"* * *In view thereof the objection relied upon by the trial court&nbsp; on this point&nbsp; loses&nbsp; weight especially when we consider that in the Maxwell Tong case&nbsp; the&nbsp; 'records&nbsp; referred&nbsp; to is a so-called master list of aliens which was started to be prepared in 1941, and the entry&nbsp; with respect&nbsp; to petitioner was&nbsp; made in 1946 and&nbsp; the data were&nbsp; taken from petitioner's application dated March 1, 1946 for the issuance of an immigrant certificate of residence', while in the case under consideration, petitioner's name and corresponding data appear in&nbsp; the master list of 1941.&nbsp; * **"</blockquote>Again, in the case of Victoriano Yap Subieng <i>vs.</i> Republic of the Philippines, 102 Phil., 892 where petitioner Subieng presented in evidence&nbsp; his Alien Certificate of Residence No. Aâ€”40086&nbsp; and his&nbsp; Native&nbsp; Certificate of Residence No. 57370,&nbsp; wherein it appears that he was born in Manila on&nbsp; May 5, 1923, this Tribunal, referring to said documents, through Mr. Justice Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; said:<br><blockquote>"** * These are official documents which were issued in due course by the immigration&nbsp; authorities and unless&nbsp; their genuineness is assailed, which&nbsp; was not, we have to give&nbsp; them due probative value.&nbsp; It is not therefore&nbsp; correct to say that the evidence of petitioner on this point is not&nbsp; supported by documentary&nbsp; evidence."</blockquote>In view of&nbsp; the foregoing, the appealed decision is hereby reversed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The application for naturalization should&nbsp; be granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador, Endencia, Barrera,</i> and <i>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
