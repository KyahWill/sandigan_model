				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On August 24, 1954, respondent&nbsp; Carlos&nbsp; Malasig&nbsp; filed with respondent Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Isabela&nbsp; an action for&nbsp; recovery of possession with&nbsp; injunction&nbsp; against the&nbsp; petitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court thereupon&nbsp; granted the&nbsp; writ of injunction&nbsp; conditioned on the filing of a bond by respondent Malasig in the sum of P500,00 guaranteed by two or more sureties, to answer&nbsp; for&nbsp; damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; The necessary bond having been filed on&nbsp; August 31, 1954,&nbsp; a "writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction was issued on September 1,&nbsp; 1954. The&nbsp; petitioners filed&nbsp; their answer&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; on November&nbsp; 22.,&nbsp; 1954 and&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; dissolve the&nbsp; preliminary injunction on&nbsp; December 12, 1954.&nbsp; Hearing&nbsp; on the latter motion was held on January 22, 1955 after which the&nbsp; court denied the same and ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; bond filed&nbsp; by respondent Malasig to be increased&nbsp; by P100,00.&nbsp; The petitioners thereafter re-entered the land&nbsp; in question; where upon respondent&nbsp; Malasig&nbsp; filed a&nbsp; petition for&nbsp; contempt against the petitioners.&nbsp; The latter have now come to this Court with a petition&nbsp; to&nbsp; set aside the orders of August 22, 1954&nbsp; and July 30, 1955, and to dissolve the writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp;&nbsp; against&nbsp; respondent Malasig.<br><br>Petitioners argue that respondent court acted with grave abuse of&nbsp; discretion&nbsp; in granting&nbsp; the writ of preliminary injunction <i>ex parte</i>&nbsp; because (1)&nbsp; it does not appear&nbsp; from the complaint that great or irreparable injury would result to respondent&nbsp; Malasig&nbsp; before the matter&nbsp; could be heard on&nbsp; notice,&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; properly verified and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; the&nbsp; bond filed&nbsp; by&nbsp; respondent Malasig was not&nbsp; sufficient in&nbsp; law.&nbsp; The petitioners&nbsp; charge&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; court&nbsp; with&nbsp; having&nbsp; summarily&nbsp; and arbitrarily denied petitioner's motion to dissolve the&nbsp; writ on the following grounds:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; that the petitioners had offered to file a bond in an amount twice&nbsp; as that filed by respondent Malasig;&nbsp; (2) that in the&nbsp; answer to the complaint, there are allegations that the petitioners were&nbsp; and had always been&nbsp; in continuous possession in concept&nbsp; of&nbsp; owner of the land&nbsp; in question,&nbsp; which called for judicial&nbsp; inquiry.<br><br>This Court finds in&nbsp; respondent Malasig's&nbsp; complaint an allegation that the petitioners were about&nbsp; to re-enter and re-occupy the land in&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; to the&nbsp; "grave damage and prejudice&nbsp; of respondent-plaintiff".&nbsp; This&nbsp; phrase&nbsp; "grave damage"&nbsp; is&nbsp; in&nbsp; form and&nbsp; substance equivalent to "great or irreparable injury." The recitals in the verified&nbsp; complaint show&nbsp; that great or irreparable&nbsp; injury would result to the&nbsp; applicant&nbsp; (respondent Malasig), in the&nbsp; following manner:<br><blockquote><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center><br>"5. That sometime in or&nbsp; about the first week of August, 1954, the defendants by themselves and through other persons, such&nbsp; as Dionisio&nbsp; Macadangcadang and&nbsp; one&nbsp; Martin nicknamed Bulbulagao, tried again to re-enter, re-occupy the land described in paragraph 2 hereof, but only&nbsp; succeeded&nbsp; in&nbsp; temporarily possessing and occupying a portion of the land;<br>"6. That the defendants with the aid and active cooperation of the persons referred to in the preceding Paragraph again&nbsp; threaten and are about to re-enter, repossess and re-occupy the land to the grave damage and prejudice of the plaintiff;<br>"7. That the plaintiff has no other&nbsp; plain, adequate and speedy remedy to protect his rights as the lawful owner of&nbsp; the land and to render&nbsp; effectual&nbsp; any relief which he is entitled under the law except the issuance by&nbsp; this Honorable Court&nbsp; of a writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to desist and to refrain from entering the land described&nbsp; in Paragraph 2 hereof and/ or occupying, possessing or cultivating the same."<br>&nbsp;<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</center></blockquote>In the verification of the complaint, the affiant, attorney for respondent Malasig,&nbsp; stated that the&nbsp; allegations&nbsp; contained therein are true&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; best of his knowledge, information and belief.&nbsp; Its sufficiency will not be looked into herein, as&nbsp; it has not been questioned&nbsp; in the lower court.<br><br>As to the contention that respondent Malasig did&nbsp; not bind himself as principal in the bond filed for the issuance of the writ in question, we find that in Annexes "C" and "I" said respondent had bound himself as principal,&nbsp; solidarily liable with the two .sureties for the damages&nbsp; that the petitioners may" sustain because&nbsp; of said writ.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is in&nbsp; the&nbsp; records&nbsp; an&nbsp; order&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; court dated January&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; 1955, relative&nbsp; to the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; dissolve&nbsp; the writ.&nbsp; We&nbsp; observe&nbsp; that said&nbsp; order allowed&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties to present&nbsp; evidence of&nbsp; actual&nbsp; possession&nbsp; and&nbsp; cultivation of the land in question&nbsp; for the year 1954-1955.&nbsp; On&nbsp; January 22,&nbsp; 1955, the&nbsp; date of "hearing, the petitioners moved the court to allow them to double the amount of the bond filed by respondent Malasig;&nbsp; they&nbsp; did not present evidence to support&nbsp; their allegation that they had&nbsp; actual possession. The court,&nbsp; finding no basis for disturbing its order granting the writ, denied their&nbsp; bid to double the amount of the bond,&nbsp; as well as their&nbsp; motion to dissolve.<br><br>It having&nbsp; been&nbsp; shown&nbsp; that&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Malasig has alleged&nbsp; ownership and possession under a Torrens&nbsp; Title, and the petitioners&nbsp; had dispossessed&nbsp; him&nbsp; of the land&nbsp; in question by&nbsp; force and intimidation,&nbsp; and&nbsp; at the hearing held for&nbsp; the&nbsp; very&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of&nbsp; settling the question&nbsp; of possession, no&nbsp; evidence was adduced to destroy the finding that respondent Malasig is the registered owner, the orders complained&nbsp; of are well founded.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the present petition is&nbsp; hereby dismissed and the writ of preliminary injunction heretofore issued against&nbsp; respondent court dissolved.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered, with costs against&nbsp; the petitioners.<br><br><i>Bengzon,&nbsp;&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor,&nbsp; Reyes,&nbsp;&nbsp; A.,&nbsp; Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Conception,&nbsp; Reyes, J.
