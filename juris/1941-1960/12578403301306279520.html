				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These three cases involve one issue and subject: admiralty jurisdiction of 
the courts of first instance. Besides identity of attorneys in all three, there 
is identity of parties in the first two. In the third, the very defendants in 
the first two cases raised the same issue.
<p>L-15618.—Typical is the first. The ruling therein announced applies with 
equal force to the others.</p>
<p>In the Manila court of first instance, to recover P1.078.33 as the value of 
undelivered goods, Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. sued Manila Port Service and/or 
Manila Railroad alleging; (a) it had insured 180 cartons of cotton piece goods 
shipped aboard the SS Pioneer Main from New York to Manila; (b) said goods 
arrived at the Port of Manila on July 10, 1958, and were unloaded into the 
custody of Manifa .Fort Service; (c) those were in turn delivered to the 
consignee with short delivery and/or damages to said shipment in the amount of 
approximately P1,078.33; (d) the shipper claimed, and thereafter received, from 
plaintiff as insurer, the value of the loss; (e) "upon such payment, plaintiff 
became subrogated to the shipper's and/or consignee's rights and interests; and 
(f) defendants refused to pay plaintiff notwithstanding repeated demands.</p>
<p>Counsel for defendants moved to dismiss, for lack of jurisdiction, because 
the amount demanded being much less than P2,000.00, the case belonged to the 
Municipal Court under Sec 88 of Republic Act 296. Opposing the motion, plaintiff 
took the stand "that the subject matter of the complaint, per allegations 
contained therein, arose from admiralty and maritime commerce, and consequently" 
pertained to the admiralty jurisdiction of the court of first instance, 
irrespective of the value in controversy.</p>
<p>Granting the motion, the court dismissed the suit, declaring itself without 
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Plaintiff appealed. In support of its side, it invokes the decision in 
International Harvester Co. <em>vs</em>. Aragon and Yaras &amp; Co., 84 Phil. 
364, wherein this Court held that the suit of the consignee agamst the sea 
carrier for damages to goods transported over the seas aboard a vessel involved 
maritime commerce and jurisdiction. But such doctrine is not applicable, because 
the suit here is directed against the arrastre service for damages presumably 
suffered <em>after the carriage by sea had ended</em> at the Manila pier upon 
delivery of the goods to the Manila Port Service. The rule applicable to the 
case may be found in Macondray &amp; Co., Inc. <em>vs</em>. Delgado Brothers, 
Inc., (107 Phil., 779; 58 Off. Gaz. [5] 899) i.e., after the briefs in these 
three cases had been duly submitted. That was a suit against the former operator 
of the arrastre service of the Manila Port, for short delivery of cargo it had 
previously received from abroad ex. MS Pleasantville. The question of admiralty 
jurisdiction having been raised—value of monetary demand being less than 
P2,000.00-this Court held the matter did not refer to admiralty jurisdiction. 
Through Mr. Justice Concepcion it explained,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The case at bar does not deal with any maritime matter or with the 
administration and application of any maritime law. As custodian of the 
sixty-eight (68) cartons of paints it had received from the MS Pleasantville, it 
was defendant's duty, like that of any ordinary depositary, to take good care of 
said goods and to turn the same over to the party entitled $g its possession, 
subject to such qualifications as may have validly been imposed in the contract 
between the parties concerned. Such duty on the part of the defendant would be 
the same if the final destination of the goods were Manila, iiot Iloilo, and the 
goods had not been imported from another state. The only issues raised in the 
pleadings are (1) whether or not defendant had fully discharged its obligation 
to deliver the aforementioned sixty eight (63) cartons of paint; and (2) in the 
negative case, the amount of indemnity due the plaintiff therefor. The 
determination of these questions does not require the application of any 
maritime law and cannot affect either navigation or maritime commerce. The 
foreign origin of the goods is—under the attending circumstances— immaterial to 
the law applicable to this case or the rights of the parties herein,, or the 
procedure for the settlement of their dispute."</p></blockquote>
<p>Note specially that this is not a suit against the carrier that transported 
the goods by sea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It is rather a 
proceeding against the operator of the arrastre service that received the goods 
from said carrier and failed to discharge its obligation to deliver them to the 
consignee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> There is nothing pertaining 
to admiralty in the discharge of such obligation of the arrastre operator.</p>
<p>Such being the case, the court below took the correct view in dismissing the 
suit.</p>
<p>L-16000; L-16116.—These other two casea for amounts leas than 1*2,000.00 were 
also filed in the Manila court of first instance. Involving similar claims, they 
were likewise ordered dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiff, to repeat, 
asserted admiralty.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the dismissal orders in the three cases are hereby 
affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C.J., Padilla, Bautista Angela, Labrador, Conception, Reyes, J. B. 
L., Barrera, Gutierrez David, Paredes</em>, and <em>Dizon, JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Orders affirmed.</em></p>

<p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The liability of the Manila Port 
Service is governed by the Management Contract it entered into with the Bureau
