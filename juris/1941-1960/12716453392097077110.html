				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case was instituted on November 16, 1953, when Eugenio Eusebio filed with&nbsp; the Court of First Instance of Rizal, a petition for his appointment as administrator of the estate&nbsp; of his&nbsp; father, Andres Eusebio, who died on November 28, 1952, residing,&nbsp; according to said petition, in the City of Quezon.&nbsp; On December 4,&nbsp; 1953, Amanda, Virginia, Juan, Delfin, Vicente and Carlos, all surnamed Eusebio, objected&nbsp; to&nbsp; said&nbsp; petition, stating that they, are illegitimate children of&nbsp; the deceased and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the latter was domiciled in San&nbsp; Fernando, Pampanga, and praying, therefore, that the case be dismissed upon the ground that venue had been improperly filed.&nbsp; By an order, dated March 10, 1054, said court overruled this objection and granted said petition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the case is before us on appeal taken, from said&nbsp; order, by Amanda&nbsp; Eusebio, and her&nbsp; aforementioned sister&nbsp; and brothers.<br><br>The appeal hinges on the situs of the residence of Andres Eusebio on November 28, 1952,&nbsp; for Rule&nbsp; 75,&nbsp; section&nbsp; 1, of the Rules&nbsp; of Court,&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"<i>Where estate of deceased persons settled.</i>—If the decedent is an inhabitant of the Philippines at the time of his death, whether a citizen or an alien, his will shall be proved, or letters of administration granted, and his estate settled, in the Court of First Instance in the province in which he resides at the time&nbsp; of his&nbsp; death, and if he&nbsp; is an inhabitant&nbsp; of a&nbsp; foreign country, the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance of any province in Which he had estate.&nbsp; The court first taking cognizance of the&nbsp; settlement&nbsp; of the estate of a&nbsp; decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts.&nbsp; The jurisdiction assumed by a court, so far as it depends on the place of residence of&nbsp; the decedent, or of the location of his estate, shall not be contested in a suit or&nbsp; proceeding, except in&nbsp; an appeal from that court, in the original&nbsp; case, or when the want of jurisdiction appears&nbsp; on the&nbsp; record."&nbsp; <br></blockquote>It is&nbsp; not disputed that up to, at least, October 29, 1952, Andres Eusebio&nbsp; was, and had always&nbsp; been,&nbsp; domiciled in&nbsp; San Fernando, Pampanga, where he&nbsp; had his home, as well as some other properties.&nbsp; Inasmuch as&nbsp; his heart was in bad&nbsp; condition and his&nbsp; son,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Jesus&nbsp; Eusebio, who treated&nbsp; him, resided&nbsp; at No.&nbsp; 41&nbsp; P.&nbsp; Florentino' St., Quezon City,&nbsp; on October 29, 1952, Andres&nbsp; Eusebio bought a house and lot at 889-A Espana Extension; in&nbsp; said City (Exhibits&nbsp; 2).&nbsp; While transfering his&nbsp; belongings to this house, soon thereafter, the decedent suffered a stroke (probably heart failure), for which reason Dr. Eusebio took him to&nbsp; his&nbsp; (Dr. Eusebio's) aforementioned residence, where the decedent&nbsp; remained until he&nbsp; was brought to the UST Hospital,&nbsp; in the City of Manila, sometime before&nbsp; November 26, 1952.&nbsp; On this date,&nbsp; he contracted&nbsp; marriage in <i>articulo mortis</i> with his common&nbsp; law wife,&nbsp; Conception Villanueva, in said hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two (2)&nbsp; days&nbsp; later, he died therein of&nbsp; "acute left ventricular&nbsp; failure&nbsp; secondary&nbsp; to hypertensive&nbsp; heart&nbsp; disease",&nbsp; at the age&nbsp; of&nbsp; seventy-four (74)&nbsp; years (Exhibit A).&nbsp; Consequently, he, never stayed or&nbsp; even slept in&nbsp; said house at&nbsp; España Extension.<br><br>It being apparent&nbsp; from the foregoing that the domicile of origin of the decedent was San Fernando, Pampanga, where he resided for&nbsp; over seventy&nbsp; (70 years,&nbsp; the presumption is that he retained such&nbsp; domicile, and, hence, residence,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the absence&nbsp; of satisfactory&nbsp; proof to&nbsp; the contrary, for it is well-settled that "a domicile once acquired is retained until a new domicile is gained" (Minor, Conflict of Laws, p. 70; Restatement of the Law on Conflict of Laws, p. 47; In re Estate of Johnson,&nbsp; 192 Iowa, 78).&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the&nbsp; circumstances&nbsp; surrounding the case&nbsp; at bar, if&nbsp; Andres Eusebio&nbsp; established another domicile,&nbsp; it must have&nbsp; been one of&nbsp; choice,&nbsp; for which&nbsp; the following conditions are essential,&nbsp; namely: (1)&nbsp; capacity to choose and freedom of choice; (2) physical presence at the place chosen;&nbsp; and (3)&nbsp; intention&nbsp; to stay therein permanently (Minor, Conflict of Laws, pp. 109-110; Goodrich, Conflict of Laws, p. 169; Velilla <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Posadas, 62 Phil, 624; Zuellig <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Republic of the Philippines, 46&nbsp; Off.&nbsp; Gaz. Suppl. No. 11,&nbsp; p.&nbsp; 220).&nbsp; Admittedly, the decedent&nbsp; was&nbsp; juridically capable&nbsp; of choosing a domicile and had been&nbsp; in Quezon City several days prior&nbsp; to his demise.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue narrows down&nbsp; to whether he intended&nbsp; to stay in that place permanently.<br><br>There is&nbsp; no&nbsp; direct evidence of&nbsp; such&nbsp; intent. Neither does the decedent appear to have manifested his wish to live indefinitely in said city.&nbsp;&nbsp; His son, petitioner-appellee, who took the witness&nbsp; stand, did&nbsp; not&nbsp; testify&nbsp; thereon, despite the allegation, in his answer&nbsp; to the aforemention, opposition of appellants herein, that "the deceased (had) decided to reside *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; for the rest of his&nbsp; life, in Quezon City". Moreover, said&nbsp; appellee did not introduce the&nbsp; testimony of his legitimate&nbsp; full brother and&nbsp; son of&nbsp; the decedent, Dr.&nbsp; Jesus Eusebio, upon&nbsp; whose advice, presumably, the house and lot at No. 889-A&nbsp; Espaiia Extension&nbsp; was purchased, and who,&nbsp; therefore, might&nbsp; have&nbsp; cast some&nbsp; light on his&nbsp; (decedent's) purpose in buying said property.&nbsp; This notwithstanding, the lower court held that the&nbsp; decedent's intent&nbsp; to stay permanently in Quezon City is "manifest" from the acquisition of said property and&nbsp; the transfer of his belongings thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; This conclusion is untenable.<br><br>The aforementioned&nbsp; house and&nbsp; lot were bought by the decedent because&nbsp; he had&nbsp; been adviced to do so&nbsp; "due to his illness", in the very words of herein appellee.&nbsp; It is not improbable—in fact,&nbsp; its is very likely—that said advice was given and followed in order&nbsp; that the patient could be near his doctor and have a more effective treatment.&nbsp; It is well settled that "domicile is not&nbsp; commonly changed&nbsp; by presence in a place merely for&nbsp; one's own health",&nbsp; even&nbsp; if coupled with&nbsp; "knowledge that one will never again be able, on account of illness, to return home." (The Conflict of Laws, by&nbsp; Beale, Vol.&nbsp; I,&nbsp; pp.&nbsp; 172-173; see, also, Shenton <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Abbott, Md., 15., A. 2d.&nbsp; 906; U.S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Knight, D.C. Mont., 291 Fed.&nbsp; 129).<br><br>Again, the decedent did&nbsp; not part with, or alienate, his house in San&nbsp; Fernando, Pampanga.&nbsp; Moreover, some of his children, who&nbsp; used to live with him in San Fernando, Pampanga,&nbsp; remained&nbsp; in that municipality.&nbsp; Then,&nbsp; again, in the deed Exhibit 2, by&nbsp; virtue of which said&nbsp; property at No. 889-A Espana Extension, Quezon City,&nbsp; was conveyed to him,&nbsp; on&nbsp; October 29, 1952, or <i>less than a&nbsp; month before his death,</i> the decedent gave&nbsp; <i>San&nbsp; Fernando, Pampanga,</i> as&nbsp; his&nbsp; residence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly,&nbsp; the "A"&nbsp; and "B" residence certificates used by&nbsp; the&nbsp; decedent in acknowledging said Exhibit 2, before a notary public, was&nbsp; issued in San Fernando, Pampanga.&nbsp; Lastly, the marriage contract Exhibit 1, signed by the deceased when he was married, in <i>artiado&nbsp; mortis,</i> to&nbsp; Concepcion Villanueva,&nbsp; at&nbsp; the UST Hospital, on November 26, 1952, or two (2) days&nbsp; prior to his demise,&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that his residence is <i>San Fernando,</i> Pampanga.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; worthy of notice that Alfonso&nbsp; Eusebio, one of the&nbsp; legitimate full&nbsp; brothers of&nbsp; the herein&nbsp; appellee, was&nbsp; a witness to&nbsp; said&nbsp; wedding,&nbsp; thus indicating that the children of the deceased by his first marriage, including said&nbsp; appellee,&nbsp; were represented on that occasion and would have&nbsp; objected to said statement about his residence, if&nbsp; it&nbsp; were&nbsp; false.&nbsp; Consequently,&nbsp;&nbsp; apart from&nbsp; appellee's failure to prove satisfactorily that the&nbsp; decedent had decided&nbsp; to&nbsp; establish his&nbsp; home in&nbsp; Quezon&nbsp; City,&nbsp; the acts of the latter, shortly and immediately before his death,&nbsp; prove the" contrary.&nbsp; At any rate, the presumption&nbsp; in favor of the retention of the old domicile<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>—which&nbsp; is&nbsp; particularly strong when the domicile is one of the origin <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; as San Fernando, Pampanga, evidently was, as regards said decedent —has not&nbsp; been offset by&nbsp; the evidence of record.<br><br>The lower court, however, rejected said Exhibits 1 and 2, upon being offered in evidence, and refused&nbsp; to entertain the same in the&nbsp; order appealed from.&nbsp; The reasons therefor&nbsp; are deducible from its resolution&nbsp; in&nbsp; rejecting said documents during the hearing of the incident at bar.&nbsp; The court then held:<br><blockquote>"Exhibits 'V and '2' are rejected&nbsp; but the same may&nbsp; be&nbsp; attached to the records for whatever&nbsp; action&nbsp; oppositors&nbsp; may&nbsp; want to take later&nbsp; on because until&nbsp; now the personality of&nbsp; the oppositors&nbsp; has not been established whether or not they have a right to intervene in this case, and the Court cannot pass upon this question as the oppositors refuse to' submit to&nbsp; the jurisdiction&nbsp; of this Court&nbsp; and they&nbsp; maintain&nbsp; that&nbsp; these&nbsp; proceedings&nbsp; should&nbsp; be dismissed.&nbsp; (P. 10, t. s. n.)<br></blockquote>In short, the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; believed that said documents should not be admitted in evidence&nbsp; before appellants had established&nbsp; their "personality" to intervene in the case, referring&nbsp; seemingly&nbsp; to their filiation.&nbsp; When appellants,&nbsp; however, sought, during said&nbsp; hearing, to&nbsp; establish&nbsp; their relation&nbsp; with the&nbsp; deceased,&nbsp; as&nbsp; his&nbsp; alleged illegitimate children, Has Honor, the trial Judge&nbsp; sustained appellee's objection thereto stating:<br><blockquote>"Your stand until now is to question the jurisdiction of this Court, and it seems that you are now trying to prove the status of your&nbsp; client; you are leading to that.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main&nbsp; point&nbsp; here&nbsp; is&nbsp; your contention that the&nbsp; deceased was never a resident of Quezon City&nbsp; and that is why I allowed you&nbsp; to cross-examine.&nbsp; If you are trying to establish the status of the oppositors, I&nbsp; will sustain&nbsp; the&nbsp; objection, unless you want to submit to the&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; of the Court. This is not yet the time&nbsp; to declare who are the persons who should&nbsp; inherit." p. 1, t. s. n.) </blockquote>Thus,&nbsp; the lower court refused to&nbsp; consider appellant's evidence on the domicile of the decedent,&nbsp; because of&nbsp; their alleged lack of "personality", but, when they tried to establish such "personality",&nbsp; they were&nbsp; barred from doing so on account of the question&nbsp; of venue raised&nbsp; by them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; find ourselves unable to&nbsp; sanction either the foregoing procedure adopted by the&nbsp; lower&nbsp; court or the inferences&nbsp; it&nbsp; drew&nbsp; from the circumstances&nbsp; surrounding the case.<br><br>To&nbsp; begin with, His Honor,&nbsp; the trial Judge had taken inconsistent positions.&nbsp; While, on the one hand, he declared&nbsp; that appellants could not be permitted to&nbsp; introduce&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; on the residence of the decedent, for they <i>contested</i>&nbsp; the <i>jurisdiction of court,</i> on the other hand, he held, in the order appealed from, that, by cross-examining the appellee, said appellants had <i>submitted themselves to the authority of the court.</i><br><br>What is more,&nbsp; this conclusion&nbsp; is refuted by the record. At the beginning of the hearing, in the lower court, appellants' counsel announced that he would take part there-in "<i>only to question the jurisdiction,</i> for the purpose of dismissing this proceeding,"&nbsp; (p.&nbsp; 2, t. s.&nbsp; n.).&nbsp; During the cross-examination of petitioner herein, said counsel&nbsp; tried to elicit the relation between the decedent and the appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; As, the appellee objected thereto, the court&nbsp; said, addressing&nbsp; appellants'&nbsp; counsel:&nbsp; <i>"Your&nbsp; stand&nbsp; until&nbsp; now is to&nbsp; question the jurisdiction&nbsp; of the&nbsp; court * * *.</i>&nbsp; If you are trying to establish&nbsp; the&nbsp; status of&nbsp; the&nbsp; oppositors, <i>I will sustain the objection, unless&nbsp; you want to submit to the jurisdiction of the court"</i>&nbsp; (p. 7, t.&nbsp; s. n.).&nbsp; There upon, appellants counsel refused to do so, stating: "I will insist&nbsp; on&nbsp; my&nbsp; stand."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, too,&nbsp; at the&nbsp; conclusion of the hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; court rejected&nbsp; Exhibits 1 and 2, for the reason that appellants&nbsp; "<i>refuse to submit to the jurisdiction of this court</i>&nbsp; and they maintain that&nbsp; these proceedings should be <i>dismissed</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, appellants&nbsp; specifically made of&nbsp; record that they were not submitting&nbsp; themselves to the jurisdiction of the court, except&nbsp; for&nbsp; the purpose only of&nbsp; assailing&nbsp; the same,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the court felt&nbsp; that appellants were <i>not&nbsp; giving&nbsp; up&nbsp; their&nbsp; stand, </i>which was, and&nbsp; is,&nbsp; a fact.<br><br>At any rate, appellants were entitled&nbsp; to establish&nbsp; facts tending to prove, not only their right to object ta appellee's petition,&nbsp; but, also, that venue had&nbsp; been laid improperly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such&nbsp; facts&nbsp; were:&nbsp; (<i>a</i>) their&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; relationship with the&nbsp; decedent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which,&nbsp; if true,&nbsp; entitle them to proceed him under the Civil Code of the Philippines; and (<i>b</i>) his alleged residence is&nbsp; Pampanga,&nbsp; In other words, the lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; should&nbsp; have admitted Exhibits 1&nbsp; and 2&nbsp; in evidence and given thereto the proper effect, in connection with the issue under consideration.<br><br>Appellee,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; asks:&nbsp; "What will&nbsp; happen&nbsp; if&nbsp; this case be dismissed in the&nbsp; Court of First Instance of Quezon City on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of jurisdiction&nbsp; or improper venue?" In&nbsp; this&nbsp; connection,&nbsp; it appears that on November 14, 1953, the Clerk&nbsp; of the Court of First Instance&nbsp; of Pampanga received a petition of appellants herein, dated November&nbsp; 4,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the settlement of the "Intestate Estate&nbsp; of&nbsp; the late&nbsp; Don Andres Eusebio".&nbsp; Attached&nbsp; to said petition was another petition for the docketing there of free of&nbsp; charge, pursuant to&nbsp; Rule 3, section 22,&nbsp; of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The latter petition was granted&nbsp; by an order dated November 16,1953,&nbsp; which was received by the cashier of said court on November&nbsp; 17, 1953,&nbsp; en which date the case was docketed&nbsp; as Special Proceedings&nbsp; No. 957.&nbsp; On December 14, 1953,&nbsp; Jesus, Eugenio, Amando anil Alfonso, all surnamed Eusebio&nbsp; (the children of the decedent by first marriage, including petitioner herein), moved for the dismissal of said proceedings, owing to the pendency of the&nbsp; present case,&nbsp; before the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of&nbsp; Rizal,&nbsp; since November&nbsp; 16,&nbsp; 1953.&nbsp; This&nbsp; motion&nbsp; was granted in an order&nbsp; dated December 21,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; relying upon the above Rule&nbsp; 75, section 1, of the&nbsp; Rules of Court, pursuant to which "the court first taking cognizance&nbsp; of the settlement of the&nbsp; estate of&nbsp; a decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts."<br><br>Although said order is now&nbsp; final, it cannot affect the outcome of the case&nbsp; at bar.&nbsp; Said order did&nbsp; not pass upon the question of domicile&nbsp; or residence of&nbsp; the decedent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp; in granting the&nbsp; court first taking cognizance of the case&nbsp; exclusive jurisdiction&nbsp; over the same, said provision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Rules of&nbsp; Court evidently refers&nbsp; to cases triable&nbsp; before&nbsp; two or more courts with <i>concurrent </i>jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could&nbsp; not possibly have intended&nbsp; to <i>deprive a competent court</i> of the&nbsp; authority&nbsp; vested therein by law, merely because a similar&nbsp; case had been previously filed, before a court to <i>which jurisdiction is&nbsp; denied by law,</i> for the same would then be defeated by the will of&nbsp; one of the parties.&nbsp; More specifically, said provision refers mainly to non-resident&nbsp; decedents&nbsp; who&nbsp; have properties in several provinces&nbsp; in the Philippines, for the&nbsp; settlement of their respective estates&nbsp; may be&nbsp; undertaken before the court of first instance of either one of said provinces, not only because said courts&nbsp; then have concurrent jurisdiction—and, hence, the one first taking cognizance of the case shall exclude the other courts—but, also,&nbsp; because&nbsp; the statement to this effect in said section 1&nbsp; of Rule 75 of the&nbsp; Rules of Court immediately follows the last part of the next preceding sentence, which deals&nbsp; with non-resident decedents,&nbsp; whose estate may be settled before the court of first instance of any province in&nbsp; which they have&nbsp; properties.<br><br>In view, however, of the last sentence of said section, providing&nbsp; that:<br><blockquote>"*&nbsp; *&nbsp; * The jurisdiction assumed by&nbsp; a court, so far&nbsp; as it depends on the place of residence of the decedent, or of&nbsp; the location of his estate, shall not be contested in a suit&nbsp; or proceedings, except in an appeal from that court, in the original case, or when the want of jurisdiction&nbsp; appears on the record."<br></blockquote>if proceedings for the settlement of the estate of a deceased resident are&nbsp; instituted in two or&nbsp; more&nbsp; courts,&nbsp; and the question of venue is raised before the same, the&nbsp; court in which the first case was filed shall have exclusive jurisdiction to&nbsp; decide said&nbsp; issue, and&nbsp; we so held in the case of Taciana Vda.&nbsp; de Borja <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Tan, L-7792&nbsp; (July 27, 1955). Should it&nbsp; be&nbsp; decided, in the proceedings&nbsp; before the said court, that venue had been improperly laid, the case pending&nbsp; therein should be&nbsp; dismissed and the&nbsp; corresponding proceedings&nbsp; may,&nbsp; thereafter,&nbsp; be&nbsp; initiated in&nbsp; the proper court.<br><br>In conclusion, we find that&nbsp; the&nbsp; decedent was, at the time of his death, domiciled in San Fernando, Pampanga; that the Court of First Instance of Rizal had no authority, therefore,, to appoint an administrator&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; estate of the deceased, the venue having been laid improperly; and that it should,&nbsp; accordingly, have sustained appellants' opposition and dismissed&nbsp; appellee's petition.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the order appealed from is hereby reversed and&nbsp; appellee's petition&nbsp; is dismissed, with costs against the appellee.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Paras, C.

This presumption may have&nbsp; a decisive&nbsp; effect,&nbsp; for if the evidence is so conflicting that it is impossible to elicit with certainty what the resident's intention is,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; being&nbsp; unable&nbsp; to reach&nbsp; a satisfactory&nbsp; conclusion one way or the other, will decide in favour of the existing domicile."&nbsp; (Private International Law by Cheshire, pp. 218-219.)<br><br>"In the absence of&nbsp; any circumstances&nbsp; from&nbsp; which&nbsp; the courts may infer&nbsp; the animus, they&nbsp; are accustomed to fall back on&nbsp; two legal presumptions, without which it would in&nbsp; some cases&nbsp; be impossible to&nbsp; arrive at any conclusions as to&nbsp; a&nbsp; party's&nbsp; domicile. "The first of these is the presumption that the party has retained the last domicile known to have&nbsp; been possessed by him.&nbsp; This&nbsp; follows from the principle that&nbsp; a domicile once acquired&nbsp; is retained until another is gained1, and from the other principle growing out of it that the burden&nbsp; of proof is on him who&nbsp; alleges a change of domicile."

No temporary sojourn in a foreign&nbsp; country will work this change.'In&nbsp; a federal case in Pennsylvania the same&nbsp; point&nbsp; was emphasized."
