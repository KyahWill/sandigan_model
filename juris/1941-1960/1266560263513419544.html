				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ DAVID, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is&nbsp; a&nbsp; petition to review on certiorari a decision of the&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation Commission awarding compensation to respondent Jose Habitan for disability alleged to have resulted from an accident arising&nbsp; out of and in the&nbsp; course of employment. &nbsp;<br><br>Respondent Jose Habitan was from February to April 27,&nbsp; 1955 employed as carpenter&nbsp; in the construction of the Espiritu&nbsp; Santo&nbsp; Parochial School&nbsp; building located at the corner of Rizal Avenue and&nbsp; Tayuman streets, Manila.&nbsp; On March 9, 1955, while he was working in said construction, the&nbsp; scaffold&nbsp; on which he and another worker were standing&nbsp; suddenly broke.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Habitan&nbsp; got hold&nbsp; of a lower scaffolding, and his co-worker was able to grab and cling to his&nbsp; right thigh thereby preventing their fall to the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; below. They&nbsp;&nbsp; remained in that precarious position until one of&nbsp; their&nbsp; co-workers went to their aid.<br><br>Thereafter, respondent Habitan, apparently none the worse for the experience,&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; with&nbsp; his work.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; continued working in the construction of the&nbsp; school building until April 27, 1955&nbsp; when he&nbsp; was laid off and paid all his wages. <br><br>On November 7, 1955, respondent Habitan, alleging that during the construction of the school building, or on March 9,&nbsp; 1955, he suffered&nbsp; an "accident injury"—referring to the incident above narrated when the&nbsp; scaffolding on which he was standing&nbsp; broke—which resulted in his&nbsp; disability to&nbsp; work,&nbsp; filed a claim for compensation with, the Workmen's Compensation&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Espiritu Santo Parochial&nbsp; School. <br><br>On&nbsp; April 27,&nbsp; 1956, herein petitioner&nbsp; Espiritu&nbsp; Santo Parish (Espiritu&nbsp; Santo Parochial School)&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion to&nbsp; dismiss the claim on the grounds that it is&nbsp; not subject to&nbsp; the jurisdiction of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation Commission because it is&nbsp; not engaged&nbsp; in a trade or occupation for the purpose&nbsp; of gain but is&nbsp; a charitable&nbsp; institution, and that the claim was barred under Sec. 24 of the Workmen's&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; Act, the notice of injury and claim for compensation having been filed&nbsp; only&nbsp; on November 4, 1955, or eight months after the accident.&nbsp; The referee assigned to hear the case, however, denied the motion, and, after&nbsp; conducting&nbsp; several&nbsp; hearings, rendered&nbsp; a&nbsp; decision awarding to the claimant the total sum of P1,060.08 as compensation for&nbsp; temporary total and permanent partial disability.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; on appeal,&nbsp; was affirmed&nbsp; by Associate&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; Sanchez&nbsp; in his&nbsp; decision dated April 26, 1957.&nbsp;&nbsp; And reconsideration of that latter decision having been&nbsp; denied by the Commission in bane, with the Chairman abstaining, petitioner filed the present petition for review on certiorari, alleging—as it did in its motion to&nbsp; dismiss—that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the case as the Espiritu Santo Parochial&nbsp; School&nbsp; is&nbsp; a church property&nbsp; organized&nbsp; for religious, educational and charitable purposes, and that the claim is already barred under section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, the notice of injury and claim for compensation not&nbsp; having been&nbsp; given&nbsp; within&nbsp; the prescribed statutory&nbsp; period of two&nbsp; months. <br><br>The&nbsp; Workmen's Compensation Act provides for compensation&nbsp; or indemnity&nbsp; for&nbsp; certain accidents or&nbsp; illness suffered by workers or&nbsp; employees engaged in "industrial employment" which,&nbsp; as&nbsp; defined in section&nbsp; 39 (d)&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Act, "includes all employment or work at a&nbsp; trade, occupation&nbsp; or&nbsp; profession exercised by&nbsp; an&nbsp; employer for&nbsp; the purpose of&nbsp; gain,&nbsp; except domestic&nbsp; service."&nbsp;&nbsp; Charitable institutions or organizations&nbsp; not organized for gain&nbsp; not coming under the general definition are, of course, excepted from the operation of the Act.&nbsp; (See Quezon Institute, et al. <i>vs.</i> Velasco, 51 Off. Gaz., 6175.) <br><br>In the&nbsp; present case, the record&nbsp; shows—and it is&nbsp; not disputed—that the Espiritu Santo Parochial School is an educational institution which belongs to and&nbsp; is administered by the&nbsp; Archdiocese of the Archbishop of Manila through the parish&nbsp; priest&nbsp; of the Espiritu&nbsp; Santo&nbsp; Church.&nbsp; The maintenance of the school is&nbsp; dependent more&nbsp; on religious and charitable sources than on school fees. As a matter of fact, of&nbsp; the 2,000 students registered in&nbsp; said school, about 40 to 50 per cent are not paying their fees because they come from&nbsp; poor families and&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; afford to pay. The respondent Commission,&nbsp; however, in addition to the above&nbsp; undisputed facts,&nbsp; found that the construction of the parochial school building&nbsp; was financed&nbsp; by loans from banking institutions&nbsp; in the&nbsp; amount of P200,000.00, of which the sum of P130,000.00 was to bear interest; that the loan is to be paid with a monthly amortization of P1,066.00; that the school&nbsp; operates just like other private schools, charging tuition&nbsp; fees, library&nbsp; fees, athletic fees, medical fees, etc., and&nbsp; that&nbsp; it paid an income tax of P400.00 for the previous year (1956) to the Government. The Commission also found&nbsp; that as admitted by herein petitioner there were eighty workers, including the claimant, employed in the construction of the parochial school building and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the petitioner's&nbsp; liability as&nbsp; employer was insured&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Philippine&nbsp; Guaranty&nbsp; Company; From&nbsp; its findings&nbsp; as&nbsp; above set forth,&nbsp; the Commission concluded that the Espiritu Santo Parochial School&nbsp; is "an educational project operating for gain" and therefore an&nbsp; employer within the purview of the Workmen's Compensation Act.<br><br>Considering the facts on record,&nbsp; we do not think that the&nbsp; findings of the&nbsp; Commission are sufficient to support its&nbsp; conclusion that&nbsp; the Espiritu Santo Parochial School-—, admittedly an educational institution.—is a "project operating&nbsp; for&nbsp; gain."&nbsp; There is&nbsp; evidence that&nbsp; the&nbsp; loan&nbsp; of P200,000.00 is being paid&nbsp; more from the church funds of&nbsp; the Espiritu Santo Parish and donations from the parishioners than&nbsp; from any&nbsp; other&nbsp; source.&nbsp; The tax of 1%&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; requirement upon all private&nbsp; schools,&nbsp; and petitioner,&nbsp; in paying such tax, is just performing its&nbsp; legal duty.&nbsp; As to the fact that its liability as an employer was insured, we fail to see how&nbsp; this could&nbsp; make petitioner an&nbsp; institution&nbsp; organized&nbsp; for profit subject&nbsp; to the jurisdiction of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.&nbsp; If at all, the insurance policy&nbsp; may be considered as a protection against its possible&nbsp; liability as an&nbsp; employer during the&nbsp; construction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; school&nbsp; building&nbsp; under the&nbsp; new Civil Code&nbsp; or other&nbsp; laws,&nbsp; but not&nbsp; under the Workmen's Compensation Act.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>We believe that as an educational institution, the operation and maintenance of which is largely dependent upon charity, the Espiritu Santo Parochial&nbsp; School could not have been&nbsp; created for profit and&nbsp; is therefore&nbsp; not an industrial&nbsp; or&nbsp; business&nbsp; organization.&nbsp; Its&nbsp;&nbsp; situation&nbsp; is, similar to that of&nbsp; San Beda College, University&nbsp; of&nbsp; San Agustin,&nbsp; Cebu Chinese High School and University of Santo&nbsp; Tomas.&nbsp; These institutions of learning have already been held by this Court to be not&nbsp; industrial&nbsp; or business organizations established for gain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup> It has also&nbsp; been held that&nbsp; the Santo Tomas&nbsp; University Hospital, the&nbsp; Quezon Institute, the Philippine National Red Cross and the Boy Scouts of&nbsp; the Philippines&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; industries&nbsp; organized for profit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; With&nbsp; greater reason, the Espiritu Santo Parochial School, which-appears to be a church&nbsp; property, should be&nbsp; declared&nbsp; as an institution not established&nbsp; for gain within the meaning of the Workmen's Compensation Act and consequently not covered by&nbsp; that&nbsp; Act. <br><br>In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; foregoing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Workmen's Compensation Commission complained of is revoked and respondent Jose&nbsp; Habitan's claim for compensation dismissed.&nbsp; Without costs.<br><br><i>Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur, <br><br><br><hr align="left" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See University of Sari Agustin <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>.
