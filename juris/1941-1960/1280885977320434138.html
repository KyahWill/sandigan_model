				<BR><STRONG>TUASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The constitutionality of Republic Act No. 4, with reference to the
 penalty therein provided, was carefully considered.  In branding 
imprisonment for five years too harsh and out of proportion in this 
case, we had in mind that six months was commensurate and just for the 
appellant's offense, taking into consideration his intention and the 
degree of his malice, rather than that it infringes the constitutional 
prohibition against the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.
  <p>  It takes more than merely being harsh, excessive, out of 
proportion, or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to the Constitution.
 "The fact that the punishment authorized by the statute is severe does 
not make it cruel and unusual."  (24 C. J. S., 118701188.)  Expressed in
 other terms, it has been held that to come under the ban, the 
punishment must be "flagrantly and plainly oppressive," "wholly 
disproportionate to the nature of the offense as to shock the moral 
sense of the community." <em>(Idem</em>.)  Having in mind the necessity 
for a radical measure and the public interest at stake, we do not 
believe that five years' confinement for possessing firearms, even as 
applied to appellant's and similar cases, can be said to be cruel and 
unusual, barbarous, or excessive to the extent of being shocking to 
public conscience.  It is of interest to note that the validity on 
constitutional grounds of the Act in question was contested neither at 
the trial nor in the elaborate printed brief for the appellant; it was 
raised for the first time in the course of the oral argument in the 
Court of Appeals.  It is also noteworthy, as possible gauge of popular 
and judicial reaction to the duration of the imprisonment stipulated in 
the statute, that some members of the court at first expressed 
opposition to any recommendation for executive clemency for the 
appellant, believing that he deserved imprisonment within the prescribed
 range.</p>
  <p>  The sufficiency of the evidence for appellant's conviction under 
Republic Act No. 4 likewise had raised close attention and study.  There
 is no need on our part to add anything to what has been said, except to
 point out for clarification that the references to defendant's previous
 uses of his father's gun and the fatal consequences of his last use of 
it, were made simply to emphasize that his possession of the prohibited 
weapon was not casual, incidental, or harmless.  His previous conduct 
was relevant in determining his motive and intention, and to disprove 
the claim that his father followed his son so as not to lose control of 
the firearm.  It was far from the thought of the court to condemn the 
appellant for acts with which he had not been charged or of which he had
 been pronounced innocent.</p>
  <p>    The confiscation of the gun is, in our opinion, in accordance 
with section 1 of Republic Act No. 4, which reads:  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"SECTION 1.  Section twenty-six hundred and ninety-two of the 
Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Commonwealth Act Numbered 
fifty-six, is hereby further amended to read as follows:</p>
    <p> "SEC. 2692. <i>Unlawful manufacture, dealing in, acquisition, 
disposition, or possession of firearms, or ammunition therefor, or 
instrument used or intended to be used in the manufacture of firearms or
 ammunition</i>.—Any person who manufactures, deals in, acquires, 
disposes, or possesses, any firearm, parts of firearms, or ammunition 
therefor, or instrument or implement used or intended to be used in the 
manufacture of firearms or ammunition in violation of any provision of 
sections eight hundred and seventy-seven to nine hundred and six, 
inclusive, of this Code, as amended, shall, upon conviction, be punished
 by imprisonment for a period of not less than one year and one day nor 
more than five years, or both such imprisonment and a fine of not less 
than one thousand pesos nor more than five thousand pesos, in the 
discretion of the court.  If the article illegally possessed is a rifle,
 carbine, grease gun, bazooka, machine gun, submachine gun, hand 
grenade, bomb, artillery of any kind or ammunition exclusively intended 
for such weapons, such period of imprisonment shall be not less than 
five years nor more than ten years.  A conviction under this section 
shall carry with it the forfeiture of the prohibited article or articles
 to the Philippine Government.</p>
    <p>"The possession of any instrument or implement which is directly 
useful in the manufacture of firearms or ammunition on the part of any 
person whose business or employment does not deal with such instrument 
or implement shall be <i>prima facie</i> proof that such article is 
intended to be used in the manufacture of firearms or ammunition."</p>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This provision does not say that firearms unlawfully possessed or 
carried are to be confiscated only if they belong to the defendant, nor 
is such intention deducible from the language of the act.  We are 
inclined to, and do, believe that, except perhaps where the lawful owner
 was innocent of, or without fault in, the use of his property by 
another, confiscation accords with the legislative intent.</p>
  <p>    We can foresee the objection that such legislation deprives one
 of his property without due process of law.  The answer to this is that
 ownership or possession of firearms is not a natural right protected by
 the Constitution.  Above the right to own property is the inherent 
attribute of sovereignty—the police power of the state to protect its 
citizens and to provide for the safety and good order of society.  (16 
C. J. S., 539, 540.)  Pursuant to the exercise of police power, the 
right to private property may be limited, restricted, and impaired so as
 to promote the general welfare, public order and safety.  (<i>Id</i>., 
611.)  The power of the legislature to prohibit the possession of deadly
 weapon carries with it the power to provide for the confiscation or 
forfeiture of weapons unlawfully used or allowed by the licensed owner 
to be used.</p>
  <p>    The motion for reconsideration is therefore denied.</p>
  <p>    <i>Paras, C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, 
Jugo, Bautista Angelo</i>, and <i>Labrador, JJ.,</i> concur.</p>
