				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A band of five men raided and robbed the house of Eulalio Bedrijo in barrio 
Matagangtang, municipality of Cataingan, Masbate, on the night of September 16, 
1946, killing Bedrijo and carrying away P400 in cash and various articles of 
personal property worth, according to the information, P200. Four witnesses 
pointed to Peregrino Franco, Ricardo Erit and Leopoldo Erit, the last two being 
brothers, as three of the perpetrators of the crime. The witnesses were 
Edilberto Bedrijo, Eulalio's son, Pablo Morales, Mauricia Catampungan, widow of 
the deceased, and Pacifico Muertegui. Their testimony is summed up in the brief 
for the Government as follows:
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears that at about 2 o'clock in the early morning of September 16, 
1946, (pp. 3, 28, 34, t. s. n.) the herein appellants, Ricardo Erit, Leopoldo 
Erit and Peregrino Franco, accompanied by two other unidentified persons, all 
armed with rifles (pp. 5, 20, 43, t. s. n.), went to the house of Eulalio 
Bedrijo, who was the barrio lieutenant of Matagangtang (pp. 5, 40, t. s. n,) 
which was located in said barrio, municipality of Cataingan, Province of 
Masfcate (pp. 2, 40, t. s. n.). Upon arriving thereat, they called from below, 
saying 'Good evening' (p. 13, t. s. n.), but as none of the occupants of the 
house answered, they fired at the house (pp. 10, 18, 31, t. s. n.). Immediately 
thereafter, Peregrino Franco and the two unknown persons went up the house (pp. 
3, 18, 20, 31, 42, t. s. n.), while the appellants Ricardo and Leopoldo Erit 
remained below, standing guard around the house (pp. 3, 14, 28, t. s. n.) The 
occupants thereof, namely, Mauricia Catampungan, wife of the deceased, Edilberto 
Bedrijo, son of the deceased, Pablo Morales, and three students, Pacifico 
Muertegui, Leandro Aguilar and Pablo Nator (pp. 33, 40, t. s. n.), were all 
herded in a room therein (pp. 14, 38, 50-51, t. s. n.). The three robbers 
started looking for the revolver of the deceased and threatened to shoot the 
occupants if they did not deliver the said revolver (pp. 11, 19, 32, 40, t. s. 
n.) to which Edilberto Bedrijo answered that he had no revolver (pp. 19, 32, 
t.s.n.), and the widow saying that her husband had taken his revolver with him 
to town (pp. 11, 19, 32, 40, t. s. n.). The marauders then demanded money from 
them and upon being told by Mauricia Catampuñgan that she had no money, they 
threatened to force open her trunk (pp. 11, 19, 32, 41, t. s. n.). Upon being 
thus threatened, Mauricia opened the trunk from which Peregrino Franco took an 
"alcancia" which he broke open and which contained silver coins amounting to 
P400 (pp. 11-12, 19, 32, 41, t. s. n.). The robbers also took away with them a 
raincoat and eyeglasses belonging to the deceased (p. 33, t. s. n.), as well as 
several articles of clothing belonging to the students (pp. 40, 42, t. s. n.), 
with a value of P66 (Exhibit 1). Moments thereafter, the deceased arrived, and 
as he was entering the gate, appellant Ricardo Erit told him not to move (p. 33, 
t. s. n.), and when the former proceeded to enter, Erit fired at him (pp. 12, 
33, 41, t. s. n.). After taking the revolver, valued at P100, from the cadaver, 
(pp. 5, 33, t. s. n.), appellants and their unknown companions hurriedly left 
the premises (pp. 39, 44, t. s. n.). </p>
<p>"As a result of the gunshot wounds he sustained on the left breast and left 
forehead (pp. 53-54, t. s. n.), the deceased expired on that same occasion (p. 
h7 t.s.n.) and was buried two days thereafter (Exhibit A)." </p></blockquote>
<p>Upon this evidence, His Honor, Judge Jose Z. de Venecia found the three 
above-named defendants (the others not having brought to trial) guilty of 
robbery and sentenced them to not less than 4 months and 1 day of <i>arresto 
mayor</i> and not more than 3 years, 8 months and 1 day of <i>prision 
correccional</i>, and to pay the heirs of the deceased P500. Ricardo Erit alone 
was pronounced guilty of homicide and, in addition to the above penalty, was 
sentenced for this offense to an indeterminate penalty of from 10 years and 1 
day of <i>prision mayor</i> to 14 years, 8 months and 1 day of <i>reclusion 
temporal</i>, and to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of 
P2,000.</p>
<p>Peregrino Franco admitted participation in the crime but said that he was 
forced by threats and intimidation by Santiago Onrubia, Zoilo de la Peña, 
Demetrio Mato and Antonio Sanchez. Ricardo Erit and Leopoldo Erit put up an 
alibi.</p>
<p>Peregrino Franco appealed to the Court of Appeals as well as Ricardo Erit and 
Leopoldo Erit but withdrew his appeal before the case was submitted for 
decision. The First Division of the Court of Appeals certified the case to this 
Court, being of the opinion that the crime committed was the complex crime of 
robbery with homicide, with aggravating circumstances, and that the imposable 
penalty was the maximum of that prescribed in article 294, subsection 1, of the 
Revised Penal Code, which is death.</p>
<p>Ricardo Erit's and Leopoldo Erit's appeal presents a question of 
identity.</p>
<p>Although, as the court below observed, the witnesses directly and positively 
affirmed that Ricardo Erit and Leopoldo Erit were the two men who stood guard 
downstairs and that Ricardo Erit shot Eulalio Bedrijo, their testimony is far 
from being airtight and is totally uncorroborated. Aside from the witnesses' 
affirmation, there is no evidence, direct or circumstantial, which links the two 
brothers with the crime in question. The truth of the testimony that the 
witnesses saw Ricardo and Leopoldo Erit through the window hinges not so much on 
the witnesses' veracity as on their ability to recognize the defendants beyond 
any possibility of mistake. That they told what they conscientiously believed to 
be true might be conceded; that their perception was correct is seriously to be 
doubted.</p>
<p>The time and the position of the parties lend ground for skepticism as to the 
accuracy of the witnesses' observation. The witnesses were all inside the house 
while the robbers, who they said were the Erit brothers, were in the yard. The 
house was quite high, high enough at least to permit a man to stand up under the 
floor. The light in the house was not described, nor was the part of the house 
where it was placed revealed. The probabilities were that it was an ordinary 
kerosene lamp, the light of which could not have transcended far beyond the 
window.</p>
<p>It is said that there was a moon, but it was not full moon, as some witnesses 
erroneously asserted. We may take judicial notice of the fact that the moon was 
in its last quarter on September 18, 1946, and rose on the 16th at 10:20 p.m. 
Granting that the night was not overcast, still we are not satisfied that a 
quarter moon afforded the people inside the house sufficient light to recognize 
the people in the yard with a reasonable degree of certainty. A person may be 
recognized through his size, his height, movements, and the shape of his body by 
another to whom those features are familiar. Edilberto Bedrijo was not so 
situated with reference to Ricardo or Leopoldo Erit. These lived eight 
kilometers from Bedrijo's house and were known to Edilberto only because this 
witness used to see them; in the market. Our doubts find concrete proof in the 
fact that Edilberto Bedrijo, of all the four witnesses, was the only one who 
said from the start that the two men who kept watch downstairs and one of whom 
shot his father were the Erit brothers. Two of the other witnesses named only 
Peregrino Franco in their extra-judicial statements. The other witness was not 
examined or presented at the preliminary investigation although he said he was 
on hand ready to testify.</p>
<p>Circumstances of affirmative character disclosed by the evidence add to the 
uncertainty:</p>
<ol><li>Peregrino Franco, who was arrested before the Erit brothers and who from 
the outset admitted complicity in the robbery, did not implicate Ricardo or 
Leopoldo Erit, either directly or indirectly, while naming four others as his 
confederates. There is no indication, and there is no reason to believe, that 
Franco committed perjury to shield these brothers or out of fear of them. He had 
more reason to be afraid of the people he squealed on Ricardo Erit and Leopoldo 
Erit, as well as Franco, were securely lodged in jail. And, a stranger from 
Iloilo, Franco was not bound with the Erits by ties of blood or friendship. 
Except for the fact that he claimed to have been forced against his will, a 
claim which we think is untrue but which was not strange for him to make, this 
defendant's testimony has the earmarks of sincerity. His answers were to the 
point, straightforward, plausible and consistent.<br><br></li><li>The people whom Peregrino Franco pointed out as his companions were not 
imaginary persons but real hardened bandits who were the terrors in Cataingan. 
Three of them were slain by the police in November, 1946, and so were still 
alive when they were incriminated by Franco. This clashes with the prosecution's 
theory that Franco falsely implicated them because they could not refute his 
statements.<br><br></li><li>On the body of one of the three men killed, Santiago Onrubia, was found 
witness Muertegui's belt, which was among the personal effects stolen from 
Bedrijo's house. This is a safe demonstration that Onrubia was one of the 
robbers. It is to be presumed from the nature of their business that Onrubia, De 
la Peña, Mato and Sanchez operated in group and were together when the crime at 
bar was committed. The information in fact named all of them as active 
participants in the crime. Now then, with Peregrino Franco there were already 
five malefactors accounted for. According to the witnesses for the Government, 
only five men composed the band, three going up the house and two remaining 
outside.<br><br></li><li>Ricardo Erit and Leopoldo Erit have not been shown to have any police 
record or reputation for lawlessness. As a matter of fact, one of them at least, 
Ricardo, appears to have gainful occupations. He was a carpenter and farmer.</li></ol>



<p>Our conclusion is that Ricardo Erit and Leopoldo Erit should be acquitted. 
The appealed decision is reversed with costs charged <i>de oficio</i>.</p> <i>Moran, C.J., Ozaeta, Paras, Feria, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones,</i> and 
<i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
