				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the Resolution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Commissioner of Land Registration, dated February&nbsp; 9, 1957, in&nbsp; connection with LRC&nbsp; Consulta No. 142.<br><br>On November 12, 1952, certain lots in Manila covered by Transfer&nbsp; Certificates of Titles Nos.&nbsp; 30644,&nbsp; 30645 and 30646&nbsp; were&nbsp; mortgaged&nbsp; by Jose J.&nbsp; Gonzales,&nbsp; the&nbsp; registered owner, to Ramon Eugenio, as security for an obligation of P30,000.00.&nbsp; The deed of mortgage was registered on November 13, 1952.&nbsp;&nbsp; On December 21, 1953, the Bank of the Philippine Islands, as executor of the testate estate of the late Graciana de&nbsp; Jesus, filed a&nbsp; notice&nbsp; of adverse claim to the effect that the transfer of the properties in question in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; Jose J. Gonzales&nbsp; was forged and fraudulent.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; adverse claim was duly&nbsp; annotated on the same day at the back of the aforesaid&nbsp; certificates of title.&nbsp;&nbsp; As Gonzales failed&nbsp; to pay the principal&nbsp; obligation, the mortgage was foreclosed judicially and, in due course, the properties&nbsp; mortgaged&nbsp; were sold on October 10, 1956 at public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; to&nbsp; respondent Consuelo&nbsp; O. Vda.&nbsp; De Eugenio, in her capacity as Administratrix of the Intestate&nbsp; Estate of the deceased Ramon Eugenio, the highest bidder, for a consideration of P36,500.00 (p. 8, Records), and&nbsp; the sheriff's sale&nbsp; was confirmed&nbsp; by the court in an order, dated October 27, 1956.&nbsp; (P. 10,&nbsp; Records)<br><br>When the sheriff's deed of sale&nbsp; was&nbsp; presented&nbsp; to the Register of Deeds&nbsp; for&nbsp; registration, Consuelo O. Vda. de Eugenio, the vendee in the auction&nbsp; sale, insisted that the adverse&nbsp; claim&nbsp; be not&nbsp; carried into new transfer&nbsp; certificates&nbsp; of title to be issued in her favor in lieu of Transfer Certificates of Title&nbsp; Nos.'30644,&nbsp; 30645 and&nbsp; 30646, while&nbsp; the&nbsp; Bank of the Philippine&nbsp; Islands, on the&nbsp; other hand,&nbsp; took the contrary stand.&nbsp; Doubtful of the step or procedure to be taken&nbsp; on the matter, under the circumstance, the&nbsp; Register&nbsp; of&nbsp; Deeds&nbsp; elevated&nbsp; the pertinent papers to&nbsp; the Commissioner of Land&nbsp; Registration,&nbsp; by way of <span style="font-style: italic;">consulta</span>, under Sec. 4 of Republic Act No. 1151, for an opinion.<br><br>After the parties, through their respective counsel, had manifested&nbsp; willingness&nbsp; to&nbsp; submit the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">consulta&nbsp;</span> without filing any memorandum (p. 19,&nbsp; Records), the&nbsp; respondent Commissioner, on the theory that "if the notice of adverse claim in&nbsp; this case&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; carried&nbsp; over&nbsp; on&nbsp; the new certificates of title&nbsp; to be issued, it will reverse the legal effects&nbsp; of priority in registration by converting a subordinate which&nbsp; is admittedly&nbsp; a superior lien, and the mortgage which&nbsp; is&nbsp; admittedly&nbsp; a&nbsp; superior lien into&nbsp; a subordinate&nbsp; lien,&nbsp; which is obviously&nbsp; absurd",&nbsp; rendered&nbsp; on February 9,&nbsp; 1957 an opinion&nbsp; holding that&nbsp; the notice&nbsp; of <i>adverse&nbsp; claim may&nbsp; not&nbsp; be carried over to the new&nbsp; transfer certificates of title to be issued to respondent Consuelo Vda. de&nbsp; Eugenio.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; dispositive portion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the ruling reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Commission&nbsp; is of the opinion, and so holds, that the petitioner Register of Deeds may give due course to the registration of the foreclosure sale in favor of Consuelo Vda. de Eugenio as Administratrix of the intestate estate of Ramon Eugenio,&nbsp; deceased, for which&nbsp; purpose he may cancel Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 30644, 30645 and 30646, and issue new certificates of title in lieu thereof,&nbsp; <i>without&nbsp; need of carrying&nbsp; over the annotation of the notice&nbsp; of adverse claim which was registered subsequent to&nbsp; the mortgage that was foreclosed</i>, without prejudice, of course, to&nbsp; the right&nbsp; of the adverse claimant to pursue all lawful remedies against the party&nbsp; or parties who allegedly defrauded the heir or heirs of the late&nbsp; Graciana&nbsp; de Jesus." (p. 24, Records;&nbsp; italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Being&nbsp; adversely&nbsp; affected thereby,&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; Bank,&nbsp; in its capacity as Executor of&nbsp; the Testate Estate&nbsp; of the late&nbsp; Graciana&nbsp; de&nbsp; Jesus,&nbsp; together with the&nbsp; testate&nbsp; heirs, Angustia&nbsp; Jimenez,&nbsp; instituted the instant&nbsp; petition&nbsp; to review the&nbsp; opinion&nbsp; above-referred&nbsp; to,&nbsp; contending&nbsp; that respondent Commissioner erred&nbsp; in (1) not holding that he had&nbsp; no jurisdiction to take&nbsp; cognizance of the&nbsp; <i>consulta</i>, (2)&nbsp; ruling that the notice&nbsp; of&nbsp; adverse&nbsp; claim in favor&nbsp; of petitioner Bank may&nbsp; be cancelled and removed from the new&nbsp; certificates of&nbsp; title&nbsp; to&nbsp; be issued to respondent&nbsp; Consuelo Vda. de Eugenio,&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3) presuming the judicial foreclosure of the mortgage to be valid and binding upon petitioner Bank, notwithstanding that it was not&nbsp; a party thereto.<br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; Bank anchors&nbsp; its insistence that respondent Commissioner has no&nbsp; jurisdiction&nbsp; to entertain the con svXta upon the&nbsp; proposition&nbsp; that the&nbsp; controversy is&nbsp; not between&nbsp; the&nbsp; Register of&nbsp; Deeds&nbsp; and respondent Consuelo Vda. de&nbsp; Eugenio,&nbsp; but actually between petitioner&nbsp; Bank, on&nbsp; one&nbsp; side, and respondent Consuelo Vda. de Eugenio, on&nbsp; the other, which falls under Sec.&nbsp; 112 of Act&nbsp; 496&nbsp; requiring a&nbsp; controversial&nbsp; issue to be&nbsp; threshed&nbsp; out&nbsp; in&nbsp; an ordinary action.&nbsp; We do not&nbsp; subscribe to this view.&nbsp; Sec. 4, Republic Act 1151,&nbsp; provides:<br><blockquote>"when the Register of Deeds <i>is&nbsp; in doubt with regard to&nbsp; the proper step to be&nbsp; taken or memorandum to be made in pursuance of any deed,&nbsp; mortgage, or other instrument presented to him for registration, or where any party in&nbsp; interest does not agree&nbsp; with the Register of Deeds with reference to any such matter, the question shall&nbsp; be&nbsp; submitted to the&nbsp; Commissioner&nbsp; of&nbsp; Land&nbsp; Registration either upon&nbsp; the certification of the Register of Deeds, stating the question upon which he is in doubt, or upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; suggestion in writing by the party in interest;</i> and thereupon the Commissioner, after consideration of the matter shown by the&nbsp; records certified to him, and&nbsp; in case of registered lands, after notice to the parties and hearing, shall enter an order prescribing the step to be taken or&nbsp; memorandum to be made.&nbsp; His decision&nbsp; in such cases shall be conclusive and binding upon all&nbsp; Register of Deeds: Provided, further, That when a party in interest disagrees with&nbsp; the&nbsp; ruling or resolution of the&nbsp; Commissioner and&nbsp; the issue&nbsp; involves a question of law, said decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court within thirty days from&nbsp; and after receipt of the notice thereof."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Thus Republic&nbsp; Act&nbsp; 1151&nbsp; expressly empowers&nbsp; the Commissioner&nbsp; of Land Registration to entertain&nbsp; a&nbsp; consulta either&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the certification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Register of Deeds&nbsp; or upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; suggestion in&nbsp; writing of&nbsp; a&nbsp; party&nbsp; in&nbsp; interest (1) when&nbsp; the Register of Deeds is in doubt with regard to&nbsp; the&nbsp; proper&nbsp; step&nbsp; to be&nbsp; taken&nbsp; or&nbsp; memorandum to&nbsp; be made in pursuance of any&nbsp; deed,&nbsp; mortgage, or other instrument presented to him for registration&nbsp; and (2) where any party in&nbsp; interest&nbsp; does not agree&nbsp; with the Register of&nbsp; Deeds with reference to such matter.<br><br>In the instant case, respondent Register of Deeds brought the <i>consulta</i> to respondent Commissioner,&nbsp; in view of the insistence&nbsp; of&nbsp; respondent Consuelo Vda. de&nbsp; Eugenio that the notice of adverse claim be not annotated at the back&nbsp; of&nbsp; the new certificates&nbsp; of title to be&nbsp; issued to her in lieu of&nbsp; the old ones, which&nbsp; insistence&nbsp; created a doubt in the mind of the Register of Deeds&nbsp; as to the&nbsp; proper step or&nbsp; procedure&nbsp; to&nbsp; be taken therein.&nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; matter does&nbsp; not&nbsp; therefore come under Section&nbsp; 112 of Act No. 496,&nbsp; which authorizes a person&nbsp; in&nbsp; interest&nbsp; <i>to ask&nbsp; the&nbsp; court for any erasure, alteration, or amendment of a certificate of title upon the ground that registered interest have terminated&nbsp; or&nbsp; ceased</i>&nbsp; (Tangunan, et al. <i>vs.</i> Republic, 94 Phil.,&nbsp; 171),&nbsp; but is clearly within the&nbsp; competence of the respondent Commissioner&nbsp; of Land&nbsp; Registration to resolve, pursuant to Section 4 of Republic Act 1151.<br><br>Petitioners&nbsp; question the legality of respondent Commissioner's ruling that the annotation of the notice of adverse claim need not be carried on the new certificates of title to&nbsp; be&nbsp; issued&nbsp; to respondent Consuelo Vda.&nbsp; de Eugenio. In&nbsp; their petition, they&nbsp; stressed the&nbsp; fact that the&nbsp; mortgagor, Jose J. Gonzales, is not the absolute&nbsp; owner of the properties&nbsp; mortgaged&nbsp; and, therefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; in question is null and&nbsp; void and&nbsp; "is&nbsp; as&nbsp; devoid&nbsp; of value and force as if it&nbsp; had not been made" (Petition, p. 6).&nbsp; Petitioners also contend that the notice of adverse claim&nbsp; which antedated the&nbsp; foreclosure and sale&nbsp; at&nbsp; public auction&nbsp; of the property subject thereto—charges all strangers with notice of the particular&nbsp; litigation or claim and, therefore, any right that may be acquired thereafter on the property is subject&nbsp; to the eventuality&nbsp; of the third&nbsp; party claim, is not&nbsp; sustainable in the present controversy.&nbsp; It is well to note that the mortgage in&nbsp; favor of the late Ramon Eugenio was&nbsp; annotated on November&nbsp; 13,&nbsp; 1952 at&nbsp; the back of the&nbsp; certificates of&nbsp; title&nbsp; in&nbsp; controversy,&nbsp; while the&nbsp; adverse claim was&nbsp; only&nbsp; annotated on the same&nbsp; certificates more than one&nbsp; year later,&nbsp; on&nbsp; December 21, 1953. Hence,&nbsp; the adverse claim could not affect the rights of the&nbsp; mortgagee; and&nbsp; the fact that&nbsp; the foreclosure of the mortgage&nbsp; and the&nbsp; consequent public&nbsp; auction sale&nbsp; have been effected long&nbsp; after the annotation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; adverse claim is of no moment,&nbsp; because the foreclosure sale retroacts to&nbsp; the date&nbsp; of&nbsp; registration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; mortgage&nbsp; (See Cruz <i>vs.</i> Sandoval, 39 Phil., 736; and&nbsp; Lopez <i>vs.</i> Vijandre, 72 Phil., 56.)<br><blockquote>"A person who takes a mortgage in good faith and for a valuable consideration, the record showing a&nbsp; clear title&nbsp; in the mortgagor, will&nbsp; be protected against any equitable titles to the&nbsp; premises, or equitable claims on the title, in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of third persons,&nbsp; of which he had no&nbsp; notice, actual or constructive and&nbsp; <i>that protection extends to&nbsp; a purchaser at a&nbsp; Sheriff's sale under proceedings on the mortgage although such purchaser had notice of the alleged equity." </i>(59&nbsp; C.J.S.,&nbsp; Sec. 233, pp. 303-304)<br></blockquote>Any&nbsp; subsequent lien&nbsp; or encumbrance annotated at the back of the certificates of title&nbsp; can not&nbsp; in any way&nbsp; prejudice the mortgage&nbsp; previously registered, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; lots subject&nbsp; thereto pass to the purchaser&nbsp; at the public&nbsp; auction&nbsp; sale&nbsp; free&nbsp; from any lien&nbsp; or&nbsp; encumbrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the value of the mortgage could be&nbsp; easily destroyed by&nbsp; a subsequent record of&nbsp; an adverse claim, for no one would purchase&nbsp; at a foreclosure&nbsp; sale&nbsp; if bound&nbsp; by the posterior claim.<br><blockquote>".&nbsp; . . Consequently, the lots passed to&nbsp; the purchaser free from the mortgage&nbsp; (second)&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the bank.&nbsp; The bank's&nbsp; claim that&nbsp; the second mortgage stands to the prejudice of the&nbsp; purchaser is untenable, <i>particularly because, as the purchaser in this case is the first&nbsp; mortgagee&nbsp; itself,&nbsp; the&nbsp; result,&nbsp; inverting the&nbsp; legal effects of the&nbsp; two&nbsp; mortgages, would practically&nbsp; be to convert the second mortgage, constituted in favor of the&nbsp; Philippine National Bank, into&nbsp; a first mortgage and&nbsp; the first mortgage, constituted in&nbsp; favor of El&nbsp; Hogar Filipino,&nbsp; into a&nbsp; second mortgage. .</i> ."&nbsp; (El Hogar Filipino&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Philippine National Bank,&nbsp; 64&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 582;&nbsp; italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; therefore clear&nbsp; that the&nbsp; adverse&nbsp; claim&nbsp; of the petitioners did not&nbsp; affect&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Consuelo Vda. de Eugenio's&nbsp; right&nbsp; as&nbsp; purchaser&nbsp; in&nbsp; the foreclosure&nbsp; sale. This&nbsp; alone is sufficient justification&nbsp; for the dropping of the adverse claim from the new certificates of title to be issued to her, as directed by respondent Commissioner in his opinion subject of this appeal.<br><br>Finally, it is argued&nbsp; for&nbsp; petitioners that they are indispensable&nbsp; parties&nbsp; and&nbsp; that the&nbsp; foreclosure&nbsp; proceeding does&nbsp; not&nbsp; bind them since&nbsp; they were&nbsp;&nbsp; not&nbsp; made&nbsp; parties thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can not&nbsp; sustain this&nbsp; view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only&nbsp; was their claim recorded after&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgage was&nbsp; registered but the&nbsp; settled rule&nbsp; is that adverse claimants are neither necessary nor proper parties to a foreclosure suit (Diaz, et al. <i>vs.</i> Reynolds, et al., 96 U. S.&nbsp; 430; 24&nbsp; L.&nbsp; Ed. 644), unless they are asserting a right or interest acquired by them <i>prior</i> to the registration of the mortgage sought to be&nbsp; foreclosed in which case&nbsp; they may&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered necessary (but not&nbsp; indispensable)&nbsp; parties.&nbsp; (Hampshire <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Greeves, 143 S. W.&nbsp; 147.)<br><blockquote>"A person, setting up&nbsp; a claim of title to the mortgaged premises adverse and paramount to&nbsp; that of the mortgagor, and&nbsp; not derived from him, is not a&nbsp; proper&nbsp; party to the foreclosure suit, as he has no interest in the subject&nbsp; matter of the action&nbsp; and his rights or title could not&nbsp; properly&nbsp; be litigated therein;&nbsp;&nbsp; (42 C. J., Sec. 1577, p. 55.)<br></blockquote>But where, as in&nbsp; the instant case, such persons are merely asserting&nbsp; titles antagonistic&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; mortgagor,&nbsp; they are not&nbsp; necessary&nbsp; parties&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; foreclosure&nbsp; proceedings. (See&nbsp; Orient&nbsp; Bldg. &amp;&nbsp; Loan&nbsp; Ass'n&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Gould,&nbsp;&nbsp; et&nbsp; al., 86 Atl. 863)<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Resolution&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is&nbsp; affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs shall&nbsp; be charged against petitioners.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div>
