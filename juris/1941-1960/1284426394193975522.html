				<BR><BR><div align="justify">&nbsp;The petitioner is a legitimate labor organization duly&nbsp; registered in the&nbsp; Department of Labor in accordance with the law of&nbsp; the Philippines.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The respondent is a business entity duly licensed to&nbsp; operate and engage&nbsp; in the business of catering food to&nbsp;&nbsp; the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has&nbsp; seventy (70) employees,&nbsp;&nbsp; seventeen&nbsp;&nbsp; (17)&nbsp; of whom are members of&nbsp;&nbsp; the petitioning labor&nbsp; organization,&nbsp; who, not being satisfied with&nbsp; their conditions as employees&nbsp;&nbsp; of the respondent,&nbsp;&nbsp; urged their&nbsp; organization,&nbsp;&nbsp; the herein petitioner, Cosmopolitan. Workers Union,&nbsp; to file&nbsp;&nbsp; in their names with the Court of Industrial Relations,&nbsp;&nbsp; on March 26,&nbsp;&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; a petition to secure&nbsp;&nbsp; vacation and&nbsp; sick leases,&nbsp;&nbsp; increase&nbsp; in wages,&nbsp;&nbsp; payment of the minimum wage as fixed by law and overtime pay for work rendered in excess&nbsp; of eight hours&nbsp; and&nbsp; on Sundays and holidays.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;After being&nbsp; only summoned,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent&nbsp;&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction in that only seventeen&nbsp;&nbsp; (17)&nbsp;&nbsp; out&nbsp; of the seventy (70) employees&nbsp; of the respondent&nbsp; filed the&nbsp; present&nbsp; petition,&nbsp; which is less than the number required by Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 103,&nbsp;&nbsp; as amended by Commonwealth Acts Nos. 254 and 599.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attached,to the motion to dismiss was a written "Joint Manifestation” of the&nbsp; fifty-three&nbsp;&nbsp; (53)&nbsp; employees&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who did not&nbsp;&nbsp; join the petition, Wherein they&nbsp; stated the following:<br><blockquote>“That we are&nbsp; satisfied with&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; conditions&nbsp; of employment&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; establishment,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; same&nbsp; being;&nbsp; in accordance with law,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; the privileges and facilities enjoyed by us being&nbsp;&nbsp; in excess of legal requirements;<br><br>"That we are&nbsp; aware&nbsp;&nbsp; of a petition filed by a so-called Cosmopolitan Workers'&nbsp; Union before&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations, docketed there in as Case No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 852-V and naming&nbsp; the said Panciteria Moderna as party&nbsp; respondent;<br><br>&nbsp;"That we are not. members of&nbsp; the&nbsp; so-called&nbsp; Cosmopolitan Workers'&nbsp; Union and&nbsp; refuse&nbsp; to be affected and/or involved in the above-mentioned litigation;<br>&nbsp;"That&nbsp;&nbsp; in consequence of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; immediately preceding paragraph,&nbsp; we irrevocably and&nbsp;&nbsp; specifically declare&nbsp;&nbsp; that we waive&nbsp; and/or renounce&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; of whatever resolution the&nbsp; Honorable Court of Industrial Relations may make on the litigation.” </blockquote>The motion to dismiss was denied by&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the Associate Judges of the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations&nbsp;&nbsp; on the ground that in interpreting&nbsp; the aforementioned provision of law,&nbsp;&nbsp; the number required bylaw for&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; court to&nbsp; acquire&nbsp;&nbsp; jurisdiction over a case is not&nbsp; the number&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the laborers&nbsp; or employees that may be affected by the final decree&nbsp; of the court,&nbsp;&nbsp; whose interests are identical&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the petitioning employees, even if they did&nbsp; not join the petition. This ruling was however reversed by the majority of the Judges&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of Industrial&nbsp; Relations when&nbsp;&nbsp; the same&nbsp;&nbsp; was submitted&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; court&nbsp; en banc on a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp; this petition for certiorari.<br><br>&nbsp;In dismissing the petition,&nbsp;&nbsp; the majority&nbsp; of the members&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; of Industrial Relations ruled as follows':<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;"This&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; a case,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tie re fore,&nbsp;&nbsp; where&nbsp;&nbsp; seventeen (17) employees presented&nbsp; a petition for concessions while&nbsp;&nbsp; their&nbsp; co-employees numbering fifty-seven&nbsp;&nbsp; (57) in all have&nbsp; categorically refused to be involved in the case because&nbsp; they are&nbsp; satisfied with&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; conditions of&nbsp; their employment and&nbsp;&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; same time they have announced irrevocably and clearly that they will not avail of any benefits which the Court may grant&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; the premises. If these fifty-seven (57)&nbsp; employees have&nbsp; just kept&nbsp; silent,&nbsp; perhaps&nbsp; it may&nbsp; justifiably be&nbsp; presumed that they would&nbsp; be&nbsp; interested in the&nbsp;&nbsp; outcome&nbsp;&nbsp; of the case&nbsp; and may be considered&nbsp; involved, therein.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be&nbsp; interpreting very liberally the particular provision of&nbsp; said section 4 requiring&nbsp; the involvement of more&nbsp;&nbsp; than thirty&nbsp;&nbsp; (30) workers in an industrial dispute before&nbsp; it maybe&nbsp; taken&nbsp; cognizance&nbsp;&nbsp; of by&nbsp; this Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;&nbsp; to include&nbsp; in&nbsp; counting the workers involved those who have&nbsp; categorically and emphatically refused to have&nbsp; anything&nbsp; to do with&nbsp; the&nbsp; case is going&nbsp;&nbsp; too far/and would&nbsp; amount&nbsp;&nbsp; to nullifying, if not changing,&nbsp; a&nbsp; clear legislative mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Court&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; change&nbsp;&nbsp; or suppress a legislative enactment;&nbsp; it&nbsp; can only interpret&nbsp; and&nbsp; apply it.<br><blockquote>"Moreover,&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; decision,&nbsp;&nbsp; in a way,&nbsp;&nbsp; overlooks the principle&nbsp;&nbsp; of majority rule&nbsp; which we&nbsp; cannot now discard without doing&nbsp;&nbsp; violence&nbsp; to&nbsp; the whole&nbsp; philosophy which underlies&nbsp; oar democratic institutions. Just imagine&nbsp;&nbsp; allowing:&nbsp;&nbsp; seventeen&nbsp; (17) persons&nbsp; to drag their&nbsp; fifty-seven&nbsp;&nbsp; (57)&nbsp; co-workers into a&nbsp; dispute which, they did not provoke&nbsp; and with which they refined&nbsp; to have anything&nbsp; to do.&nbsp; Even&nbsp; the recently enacted Industrial Peace Act&nbsp; (R.A.&nbsp;&nbsp; 875)&nbsp; requires that labor organization may act as&nbsp; the exclusive representative&nbsp; of all tie employees in an appropriate&nbsp; collective bargaining&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit&nbsp;&nbsp; only if it is&nbsp; this choice&nbsp;&nbsp; of the majority&nbsp; of said employees."</blockquote>&nbsp;We entirely agree with this ruling, for we find it to be In&nbsp; conformity with the provisions of Section 4 of Commonwealth Act No.&nbsp; 103,&nbsp;&nbsp; as amended which provides:<br><blockquote>"Strikes and lockouts.—The&nbsp; Court&nbsp; shall take cognizance for purposes of prevention,&nbsp;&nbsp; arbitration, decision,&nbsp;&nbsp; and settlement,&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; any industrial or agricultural dispute&nbsp; causing or likely to cause a strike&nbsp;&nbsp; or lockout,&nbsp;&nbsp; arising from differences as regards wages,&nbsp;&nbsp; shares&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; compensation, dismissals, lay-offs,&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; suspensions of employees or laborers, tenants or farm-laborers,&nbsp;&nbsp; hours of labor,&nbsp;&nbsp; or conditions of tenancy&nbsp;&nbsp; or employments,&nbsp;&nbsp; between employers and employees or laborers and&nbsp;&nbsp; between landlords and tenants&nbsp; or farm-laborers provided that the number of&nbsp; employees,&nbsp;&nbsp; laborers&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; tenants&nbsp; or farm-laborers involved exceeds&nbsp; thirty, and&nbsp; such industrial or agricultural dispute&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court by the Secretary&nbsp; of Labor,&nbsp; or by any or both of the parties&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; controversy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all&nbsp; such cases, the Secretary of Labor,&nbsp; or the party&nbsp; or parties submitting the dispute,&nbsp;&nbsp; shall clearly and specifically state in writing the&nbsp;&nbsp; questions&nbsp; to be&nbsp; decided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the&nbsp;&nbsp; submission&nbsp; of such a&nbsp; controversy, or question by the Secretary of&nbsp; Labor,&nbsp;&nbsp; his intervention therein as authorized by law,&nbsp;&nbsp; shall cease.”</blockquote>&nbsp;It is&nbsp;&nbsp; our considered opinion that the aforoquoted provision of law&nbsp; should be interpreted to&nbsp; the effect that&nbsp; the court&nbsp; could&nbsp;&nbsp; only acquire&nbsp;&nbsp; jurisdiction over a petition filed by thirty (30) employees who have some quarrel,&nbsp; grievance or dispute&nbsp; against their employer in connection with&nbsp; their, labor, condition and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that a petition filed by less than thirty&nbsp; (30) employees&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot be acted upon or entertained by th3&nbsp; court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For,&nbsp; a&nbsp; contrary interpretation would give a single employee right&nbsp; to file&nbsp; a petition against his employer,&nbsp;&nbsp; even&nbsp; against&nbsp; Idle will&nbsp; of&nbsp; Ms&nbsp; co-workers,&nbsp;&nbsp; if the result&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; the petition may affect&nbsp; all of them,&nbsp; which interpretation,&nbsp;&nbsp; we believe,&nbsp;&nbsp; is beyond&nbsp; the purview of the&nbsp; afore-quoted provision of law.<br>&nbsp;<br>WHEREFORE,&nbsp; the petition under consideration is hereby denied,&nbsp; without any pronouncement with regard to costs.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<i>Paras, C.J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.B.L.,</i> and <i>Endencia, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
