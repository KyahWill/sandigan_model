				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Remedios Obispo, born out of wedlock on 5 of August 1921, is the daughter of Sebastian Obispo&nbsp; and Fructuosa Labrador who at the time&nbsp; of&nbsp; her&nbsp; conception&nbsp; and birth were free to marry, as in&nbsp; fact they did marry on&nbsp; 4&nbsp; February 1924 before the justice&nbsp; of the peace of Botolan, Zambales.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sebastian Obispo is&nbsp; one&nbsp; of the children of the late Francisco&nbsp; Obispo&nbsp; and&nbsp; Dorotea&nbsp; Apostol.&nbsp; Sebastian Obispo died on 6 December 1940 and his widowed mother Dorotea Apostol on 15 June 1945.&nbsp; On 12 of August 1940, Dorotea Apostol and her five children with her late husband Francisco Obispo executed a deed of partition not only&nbsp; of the parcels of land which were the exclusive property of her late husband&nbsp; but&nbsp; also those belonging to her as paraphemal (Exhibit A).&nbsp; Parcels No. 2, 3 and 4 described in the complaint belonged exclusively&nbsp; to the late Francisco Obispo, whereas parcels Nos. 1 and 5 also described in the complaint were paraphemal of Dorotea Apostol. In accordance with the partition the live&nbsp; parcels of land were awarded to Sebastian Obispo. On 17 October 1940, Sebastian Obispo executed a deed of donation of eleven&nbsp; parcels of land including the five awarded to him in the&nbsp; deed of partition (Exhibit A) to his wife Fructuosa Labrador and his daughter Remedios Obispo&nbsp; Labrador&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B).&nbsp; As&nbsp; already&nbsp; stated, on&nbsp; 15 June&nbsp; 1945 Dorotea Apostol died and her&nbsp; daughter Olimpia&nbsp; Obispo commenced&nbsp; proceedings for the probate of a will&nbsp; of her late mother where she was named executrix (Exhibit 1). Remedios Obispo brought an action against Olimpia&nbsp; Obispo to recover possession of five&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of land, alleging that the second,&nbsp; third and fourth parcels of&nbsp; land&nbsp; described in the complaint were inherited by her from her late father Sebastian Obispo who in turn had inherited them from his late father&nbsp; Francisco, by&nbsp; virtue of a deed of partition executed by the surviving widow and her five children had with her late husband Froncisco Obispo (Exhibit A); and the first and fifth parcels of land also described in the complaint&nbsp; were inherited by her from her&nbsp; late grandmother Dorotea Apostol,&nbsp; in&nbsp; representation of her late&nbsp; father Sebastian Obispo.&nbsp; After&nbsp; trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First&nbsp; Instance of Zambales rendered judgment holding—&nbsp; <blockquote><p>* *&nbsp; * that&nbsp;&nbsp; Remedios&nbsp;&nbsp; Obispo&nbsp; y&nbsp;&nbsp; Labrador&nbsp; was&nbsp; the&nbsp; natural child of the late&nbsp; Sebastian&nbsp; Obispo and&nbsp; Fructuosa&nbsp; Labrador, duly acknowledged and legitimated by&nbsp; the&nbsp; subsequent marriage of her parents, and—as such—is entitled to inherit front both her&nbsp; father and her grandmother, Dorotea Apostol; that the deeds&nbsp; of partition (Exhibit "A") and donation&nbsp; (Exhibit "B") were perfectly valid and binding with respect to Remedios&nbsp; Obispo and her grandmother, Dorotea Apostol, and other children&nbsp; of the latter and&nbsp; with respect to the properties described therein; and that said Remedios&nbsp; Obispo came into possession and became the owner of the said five parcels of land described in the complaint by&nbsp; virtue of said two deeds. The court likewise orders the defendants to return to&nbsp; the plaintiffs the above mentioned five&nbsp; parcels of&nbsp; land and to&nbsp; deliver to the&nbsp; latter&nbsp; thirty&nbsp; cavanes every year&nbsp; or to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; them the plaintiffs) the equivalent market value of&nbsp; P10&nbsp; a&nbsp; cavan or in all P300 from 1942 until&nbsp; the delivery is&nbsp; made, and&nbsp; to pay the costs of this action.</p></blockquote><p>Olimpia&nbsp; Obispo appealed&nbsp; from the&nbsp; judgment to&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court' of Appeals claiming that&nbsp; Remedios&nbsp; Obispo&nbsp; could t not&nbsp; be deemed legitimated&nbsp; by subsequent&nbsp; marriage because, she was not&nbsp; duly acknowledged&nbsp; by&nbsp; her father in the&nbsp; record of&nbsp; birth, or in&nbsp; a&nbsp; will,&nbsp; nor was&nbsp; she&nbsp; being then&nbsp; a minor&nbsp; acknowledged with judicial&nbsp; approval,&nbsp; as provided&nbsp; for in&nbsp; article&nbsp; 133&nbsp; of the old Civil Code; that the deed&nbsp; of partition was not&nbsp; legally sufficient to convey and transfer&nbsp; to&nbsp; the parties thereto&nbsp; the possession&nbsp; and ownership of the&nbsp; parcels of land partitioned therein&nbsp; which included&nbsp; parcels&nbsp; of land&nbsp; belonging&nbsp; as paraphernal&nbsp; to Dorotea Apostol, for she could&nbsp; revoke said partition&nbsp; by the execution of a&nbsp; last will and&nbsp; testament.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Court of Appeals affirmed&nbsp; the&nbsp; judgment of the trial court. The defendants come to&nbsp; this Court&nbsp; by way of certiorari to have the judgment of the Court of Appeals reviewed.</p><p>In support of their&nbsp; contention that lack&nbsp; of&nbsp; judicial approval&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the acknowledgment of&nbsp; minor&nbsp; Remedios Obispo as&nbsp; natural child made under oath on 17&nbsp; October 1940 before the justice of the peace of Cabangan, Zambales, by her father Sebastian&nbsp; (Exhibit E),&nbsp; prevents her from acquiring the&nbsp; condition or&nbsp; status&nbsp; of legitimated child by subsequent marriage,&nbsp; the&nbsp; petitioners cite article 121 of the old Civil&nbsp; Code which provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Children&nbsp; shall be considered as legitimated&nbsp; by a subsequent marriage only when they&nbsp; have been acknowledged&nbsp; by&nbsp; the parents before or after the celebration thereof; </p></blockquote><p>the second paragraph of article 133 of the same&nbsp; Code which&nbsp; provides:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>The approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court to&nbsp; be granted&nbsp; after&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; the prosecuting&nbsp; officers,&nbsp; shall&nbsp; be necessary to the acknowledgment of a minor, unless such acknowledgment be made&nbsp; in&nbsp; a certificate of birth or in a will;</p></blockquote><p>and&nbsp; the decisions of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; to wit:&nbsp; Legarre&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cuerques,&nbsp; 34 Phil., 221; Madridejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De Leon,&nbsp; 55 Phil 1; and In re: Judicial approval of&nbsp; the&nbsp; acknowledgment of Zenaida Jiro Mori, 46 Off.&nbsp; Gaz., 5460.</p><p>In Legarre <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Cuerque,&nbsp; supra, and In re: Judicial approval&nbsp; of&nbsp; the acknowledgment of&nbsp; Zenaida&nbsp;&nbsp; Jiri&nbsp; Mori supra, there was no marriage&nbsp; of the natural parents; and an acknowledgment before a notary public&nbsp; was&nbsp; held&nbsp; insufficient.&nbsp; In Madridejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. De Leon, supra,&nbsp; the marriage of the natural parents alone without an acknowledgment by them of the natural&nbsp; child could not bring&nbsp; about&nbsp; legitimation of&nbsp; the child.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the validity or&nbsp; legality of an&nbsp; acknowledgment of a&nbsp; minor natural child&nbsp; by any of&nbsp; his natural parents, under the provisions of Article&nbsp; 133 of the old Civil&nbsp; Code, judicial approval thereof was&nbsp; necessary. Article 133 of the old Civil Code, comes under Chapter IV, Title V,&nbsp; Book I, that deals with&nbsp; illegitimate children and acknowledgment of natural children,&nbsp; whereas Article 121 of the same Code comes under the preceding chapter that treats&nbsp; of legitimated&nbsp; children.&nbsp; The&nbsp; acknowledgment&nbsp; required in article 121 is not the same as that required in Article 133 when the natural child to be acknowledged is a minor.&nbsp; The acknowledgment under the&nbsp; former&nbsp; article does not need judicial approval.&nbsp; Commenting on this article Manresa says:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>En que forma se ha&nbsp; de&nbsp; hacer&nbsp; el reconocimiento?&nbsp; El Codigo la establece taxativamente en el&nbsp; art. 131,&nbsp; y a el noa remitimos para esta cuestion.&nbsp; </p><p>Pero&nbsp; ;bastara&nbsp; la manifestation a que&nbsp; se&nbsp; refiere el Articulo&nbsp; 67 numero 3." de la&nbsp; ley del Registro civifl?&nbsp; Segun dicho numero, en&nbsp; las inscripciones&nbsp; de matrimonio deben constar&nbsp; los nombres de los hijos naturales que por el matrimonio se legitiman y que los constrayentes hayan manifestado haber tenido.&nbsp;&nbsp; Esta manifestation,&nbsp; seguida de su insercion en el acta de matrimonid, y de las notas que debe motivar en las respectivas actas de nacimiento, no pueden raenos de considerarse como un reconocimiento formal de los&nbsp; hijos naturales, consignado en forma que&nbsp; merece .fe, por lo&nbsp; cual creemos que es desde luego&nbsp; suficiente&nbsp; a&nbsp; los&nbsp; efectos&nbsp; del&nbsp;&nbsp; art.&nbsp; 121.&nbsp; * * *&nbsp; (Comentarios&nbsp; al Codigo Civil Espanol, Vol. 1, p. 569, 5th ed.)</p></blockquote><p>From this&nbsp; it may&nbsp; be&nbsp; inferred that the&nbsp; judicial&nbsp; approval of an acknowledgment of a minor&nbsp; natural child for the purpose of legitimation by marriage of the natural parents is not&nbsp; necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; And commenting on Article&nbsp; 133, the same author says:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Los padres, como dijimos en su lugar, pueden contraer matrimonio, y hacer constar en&nbsp; el acta los nombres&nbsp; de sus hijos naturales que por el matrimonio han de ser&nbsp; legitimados.&nbsp; Hemos considerado este ncto&nbsp; suficiente a los efectos del reconocimiento; pero como no consta hecho ni en&nbsp; el&nbsp; acta&nbsp; de&nbsp; nacimiento,&nbsp; ni en&nbsp; el&nbsp; testamento&nbsp; de los padres si el&nbsp; hijo, o los&nbsp; hijos son menores de edad,&nbsp; como sera lo mas&nbsp; frecuente, se necesitara la&nbsp; aprobacion judicial,&nbsp; con&nbsp; arreglo al art.&nbsp; 133?&nbsp; Parece a&nbsp; primera vista&nbsp; irremediable&nbsp; ese requisito,&nbsp; lo que&nbsp; equevaldria&nbsp; a arrebatar&nbsp; a&nbsp; esos hijos, en muchos casos, algo irreflexivamente,&nbsp; la legitimidad que debia corresponderles.&nbsp; Aunque tenemos la&nbsp; creencia de que el&nbsp; legislador, lo mismo en este articulo que en el 131 y aun en el 121, no tuvo en cuenta la&nbsp; cuestion presentada, debe, en nuestra opinion, resolverse en el sentido mas favorable&nbsp; a los hijos,&nbsp; atendiendo al espiritu del Codigo&nbsp; en&nbsp; la&nbsp; materia, a los principios generales de Derecho,&nbsp; y las razones Qegales siguientes:&nbsp; primera, que la&nbsp; manifestation hecha por los padres en el acta de su matrimonio de&nbsp; tener determinados&nbsp; hijos naturales&nbsp; y&nbsp; querer legitimarlos,&nbsp; debe hacerse constar por nota en&nbsp; las actas de nacimiento de esos&nbsp; hijos, con arreglo a&nbsp; la&nbsp; ley&nbsp; del&nbsp; Registro&nbsp; civil con lo cual, el reconocimiento del menor resultara en el acta de su nacimiento,&nbsp; debiendo asi&nbsp; estimarse cumplido el art. 133;&nbsp; y segunda, que este articulo exige&nbsp; el consentimiento del hijo para ser reconcido como natural solamente;&nbsp; pero no&nbsp; hay&nbsp; articulo&nbsp; alguno&nbsp; considere necesario&nbsp; ese consentimiento, o, en su defecto, la aprobacion judicial para&nbsp; ser&nbsp; considerado como&nbsp; legitimo, y&nbsp; la exigencia de tal requisito y&nbsp; consiguiente&nbsp; aplicacion del&nbsp; articulo&nbsp; 133 al caso propuesto, solo conduciria a privar a los hijos en ciertos casos de su condicion&nbsp; de legitimos, por vanas, absurdas e&nbsp; innecesarias exigencias&nbsp; literales de interpretacion.&nbsp; (supra,&nbsp; pp. 595-596.)</p></blockquote><p>We&nbsp; are&nbsp; of the opinion that&nbsp; the acknowledgment&nbsp; under oath of&nbsp; minor&nbsp; Remedios Obispo&nbsp; as natural&nbsp; child of Sebastian&nbsp; Obispo&nbsp; made by the&nbsp; latter on 17 October&nbsp; 1940 before a justice of&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace&nbsp; (Exhibit E)&nbsp; did not need judicial&nbsp; approval&nbsp; for her&nbsp; to&nbsp; acquire the&nbsp; status of&nbsp; legitimated&nbsp; child by&nbsp; the&nbsp; marriage of her natural parents.</p><p>As regards the claim that the partition was null and void&nbsp; and of no&nbsp; effect because Dorotea Apostol&nbsp; could not enter&nbsp; into&nbsp; an&nbsp; agreement or contract regarding&nbsp; future inheritance with&nbsp; her&nbsp; children,&nbsp; suffice it to&nbsp;&nbsp; say&nbsp; that, as to the three&nbsp; parcels of land which belonged exclusively to her late spouse Francisco&nbsp; Obispo,&nbsp; said partition&nbsp; was lawful and valid as&nbsp; she did&nbsp; not&nbsp; have&nbsp; any right&nbsp; to&nbsp; said parcels&nbsp; of land&nbsp; except her usufruct as widow&nbsp; which she could&nbsp; waive.&nbsp; As&nbsp; to the first&nbsp; and&nbsp; fifth parcels of&nbsp; land which are paraphernal, the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; Appeals&nbsp; found:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>*&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; We have gone carefully&nbsp; over&nbsp; the evidence&nbsp; of record, and we fully concur with&nbsp; the trial&nbsp; court that each of the&nbsp; heirs of the late Francisco&nbsp; Obispo&nbsp; took&nbsp; possession of their respective shares alloted to them after the execution of the deed of&nbsp; partition (Exhibit&nbsp; A).&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; it&nbsp; would even appear&nbsp; from the&nbsp; deed&nbsp; of partition itself that some of the heirs have possessed and sold some of their shares&nbsp; even&nbsp; before the execution of&nbsp; the&nbsp; deed of partition. Andres Obispo, another brother of appellant Olimpia, also said that all of the heirs took possession of&nbsp; their respective&nbsp; shares&nbsp; after the execution of&nbsp; the deed&nbsp; of partition.&nbsp; While&nbsp; this&nbsp; witness was presented&nbsp; as a&nbsp; witness for the&nbsp; appellees, his testimony&nbsp; deserves full faith and credit because we&nbsp; find&nbsp; nothing in the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; of record to&nbsp; show why he took the side of plaintiff&nbsp; Remedios Obispo, his niece, as against defendant Olimpia&nbsp; Obispo, his own sister.&nbsp; </p><p>We also&nbsp; agree with&nbsp; the findings of the Court below&nbsp; that parcels Nos. 2, 3&nbsp; and 4,&nbsp; of the complaint, were originally the&nbsp; exclusive property of the late Francisco Obispo, while the other two parcels of land "were the property of the late Dorotea&nbsp; Apostol.&nbsp; Parcels Nos. 2, 3&nbsp; and 4&nbsp; are&nbsp; declared&nbsp; in the name of Francisco&nbsp; Obispo while parcels Nos. 1 and 5 are declared under the name of Dorotea Apostol.&nbsp; Furthermore, Andres&nbsp; Obispo also testified&nbsp; that parcels Nos. 2, 3&nbsp; and 4&nbsp; belonged to his father, Francisco&nbsp; Obispo,&nbsp; and parcels Nos. 1 and 5 to&nbsp; his mother,&nbsp; Dorotea Apostol.&nbsp; We find, therefore,&nbsp; no valid&nbsp; reason why&nbsp; the&nbsp; extrajudicial&nbsp; partition&nbsp; made between&nbsp; Dorotea&nbsp; Apostol and&nbsp; her&nbsp; children&nbsp; had&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; late Francisco&nbsp; Obispo, with&nbsp; respect&nbsp; to&nbsp; the estate of&nbsp; said Francisco Obispo, should not be respected.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its due execution is not impugned, and it has&nbsp; always&nbsp; been the tendency in courts, whether&nbsp; sittings as a probate courts or courts of&nbsp; ordinary&nbsp; jurisdiction,&nbsp; to&nbsp; respect the wishes of a deceased or the&nbsp; division made by&nbsp; his heirs, unless the disposition&nbsp; or&nbsp; division&nbsp; is&nbsp; not in accordance with&nbsp; law.&nbsp; With respect to the estate of Dorotea Apostol, such as&nbsp; parcels Nos. 1&nbsp; and 5 of the complaint,&nbsp; which&nbsp; were also adjudicated in favor of the late Sebastian&nbsp; Obispo&nbsp; in the&nbsp; partition, we agree with counsel for the appellant that, upon the authority of the doctrine laid down by this Court&nbsp; in Maria Reyes&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>, Anicia Reyes, 45 off. Gaz., April, 1949, p. 1836, the late Dorotea Apostol had the right to revoke&nbsp; the partition insofar as&nbsp; her own&nbsp; properties were concerned as she, in fact, did when she executed her will (Exhibit 1).&nbsp; But she could not deprive her granddaughter,&nbsp; Remedios,. of&nbsp; her just&nbsp; share&nbsp; in&nbsp; the inheritance. The right&nbsp; of Remedios Obispo to represent her&nbsp; father is not affected by the fact that her said father predeceased Dorotea Apostol, because she&nbsp; enjoys the same rights&nbsp; as&nbsp; legitimate&nbsp; children&nbsp; (Article&nbsp; 122, old&nbsp; Civil&nbsp; Code).&nbsp; This&nbsp; is one&nbsp; of&nbsp; the rights&nbsp; appertaining to&nbsp;&nbsp; a legitimated natural&nbsp; child of&nbsp; a descendant&nbsp; who predeceases his own legitimate&nbsp; parent, which is r.ot&nbsp; enjoyed by an&nbsp; acknowledged natural child (Llorente <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>, Rodriguez, 10&nbsp; Phil. 595).&nbsp; Since it has not been shown that the apportionment of parcels Nos. 1 and 5 in&nbsp; favor of the&nbsp; late Sebastian&nbsp; Obispo&nbsp; affects the two-thirds,&nbsp; legitlme&nbsp; of the others&nbsp; heirs of Dorotea Apostol, such&nbsp; apportionment&nbsp; should also be respected.</p></blockquote><p>Finding&nbsp; no&nbsp; error&nbsp; in the&nbsp; judgment appealed from, we affirm it, with&nbsp; costs&nbsp; against the petitioners.</p><p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon,&nbsp; Montemayor, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo, Reyes,&nbsp; J. B. L., Endencia,</em>&nbsp; and <em>Felix, JJ., </em>concur.</p></div>
