They cannot claim exemption from criminal liability simply because they did&nbsp; not actually take&nbsp; pajt in the shooting and did not even go up the house.&nbsp; Obviously, they played the role of guards or&nbsp; lookouts&nbsp; by remaining, downstairs, thereby contributing in&nbsp; an&nbsp; important manner&nbsp; to the success&nbsp; of the&nbsp; enterprise;&nbsp; In those circumstances,&nbsp; their liability, under the law, is&nbsp; that of principals.<br><br>We agree with the trial court that the crime committed was robbery in band with triple homicide.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was error to sentence the appellants to three life&nbsp; imprisonments&nbsp; each as if three separate crimes had been&nbsp; committed.&nbsp; The complex crime of robbery with homicide&nbsp; is not to be multiplied with&nbsp; the number&nbsp; of&nbsp; persons killed. As was said by this Court in People vs. Madrid, <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> G. R. No. L-3023, January&nbsp; 3, 1951, "the&nbsp; general concept&nbsp; of this. crime does not limit the&nbsp; taking of human&nbsp; life to one single&nbsp; victim&nbsp; making the slaying of human beings&nbsp; in excess of that number&nbsp; punishable&nbsp; as separate individual offense&nbsp; or offenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the&nbsp; homicides or murders are merged in the composite, integrated whole that is robbery with homicide&nbsp; so long&nbsp; as the killings were&nbsp; perpetrated by&nbsp; reason or&nbsp; on the&nbsp; occasion&nbsp; of the robbery."&nbsp; Such appears to be the case here.<br><br>The crime committed is punishable, under Article 294 in relation&nbsp; to&nbsp; Article'&nbsp; 296 of the Revised&nbsp; Penal&nbsp; Code, as amended by Republic Act&nbsp; No. 12, with <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to&nbsp; death.&nbsp; We cannot&nbsp; agree with the trial&nbsp; court that the perpetrators did not intend to commit so grave a crime as that which actually resulted, and even if lack of instruction be taken, into&nbsp; account as recommended by the Solicitor General, this&nbsp; would not be enough to&nbsp; offset the aggravating circumstances of treachery and dwelling which, attended the commission of the crime, so that the penalty prescribed by law is&nbsp; imposable in its maximum degree.&nbsp; But for lack of&nbsp; sufficient votes for&nbsp; the&nbsp; imposition of the death penalty, the appellants are&nbsp; only sentenced to&nbsp; life imprisonment in addition to the indemnity imposed by the trial court.<br><br>Modified as to the penalty,&nbsp; the&nbsp; sentence of conviction is affirmed with costs against&nbsp; the apppellant.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
