				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Lorenzo Torreon died as a result of bodily
injuries inflicted upon him. Donato Tortuga, Jose Tortuga, Vicente
Tortuga, Marcelino Tortuga and Andre's Tortuga were charged with murder
for the death of Lorenzo Torreon. After trial the Court of First
Instance of Bohol acquitted Donato Tortuga, Jose Tortuga, Vicente
Tortuga and Andres Tortuga upon reasonable doubt, and found Marcelino
Tortuga guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide and, taking into
consideration abuse of superior strength and the age of the victim who
was over 60 years, sentenced him to suffer an indeterminate sentence of
from 10 years and1 day of <em>prision mayor</em> to 20 years of <em>reclusion temporal</em> to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P2,000 and to pay one-fifth of the costs. Marcelino Tortuga has appealed.
<p> It appears that on 9 October 1944, Lorenzo Torreon hired three
laborers to plow his land la Cantamugday, municipality of Jetafe,
province of Bohol. At about 8:00 o'clock in the morning of that day,
Donato Tortuga and his children Jose, Vicente, Marcelino, Andres and
Marciano, the last named killed by the guerrillas while under arrest
for the death of Lorenzo Torreon, all armed with bolos except Marcelino
who was with a spear, appeared at the place where Margarito Anco and
Antonio Torreon, two farm hands engaged by Lorenzo Torreon, were
plowing. Upon seeing them the laborers abandoned their ploughs, and the
Tortugas crossed the creek and came to the place where Lorenzo Torreon
was. As the latter noticed the aggressive attitude of the Tortugas he
shouted "Let us talk things over." Jose told Lorenzo to put down his
bolo. The latter did as he was told. Marciano went behind Lorenzo and
with his bolo hacked him while Jose thrust his bolo into Lorenzo's
abdomen. The latter tried to run away but stumbled down when his pajama
loose trousers were hooked on the barbed wire fence. He rose and again
attempted to run away but Marcelino speared him on the back. Lorenzo
fell down. After the latter's fall the Tortugas set upon him with their
weapons until he died. Zosimo Flores, one of the farm hands, ran
towards the house of Melchora Obregon de Torreon, the wife of Lorenzo,
and told her that her husband was killed. After receiving the report
that Lorenzo Torreon was killed, Ananias Abellana, who at the time of
the occurrence was a captain of the Army and at the time of the trial
the commander of the M.P.C. of the province of Bohol, together with
Perfecto Torcinde, who at the time of the occurrence was a municipal
policeman of Jetafe, Bohol, and at the time of the trial the chief of
police of the said municipality and Florentino Alfar, a sergeant of the
USAFFE, made an inquest of the deceased in the afternoon of that day
and found in his body the following bruises and wounds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> (<em>a</em>) Body lying face upward, head towards the North, and feet towards the South.</p>
  <p> (<em>b</em>) One (l) punctured wound, 2 inches deep, l/2 inch wide on the right side chest.</p>
  <p> (<em>c</em>) One spear wound above the right breast, 1-1/4 inches wide and 4 inches in penetration.</p>
  <p> (<em>d</em>)

the exposure of the right intestine during the examination.</p>
  <p> (<em>e</em>) One (l) punctured wound on the left side of the scrotum, causing the exposure of the left testis.</p>
  <p> (<em>f</em>) Five (5) long elongated bruises, presumably caused by barbed wire on the left thigh just above the knee.</p>

  <p> (<em>r</em>) One (1) bruise probably inflicted by a blade weapon located on the right arm. (Exhibit A.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> The appellant claims that it was Marciano Tortuga alone who killed
Lorenzo Torredn because the latter destroyed the former's cornfield and
that the other defendants were not present and did not take part in the
killing of Lorenzo Torreon. It is claimed that Jose" was harvesting
corn in Ondol, four kilometers away from the place of the incident;
Vicente was at Butong, municipality of Talibon, and the rest
—Marcelino, Andres and their father Donate— were in Cangmundo, the
first two plowing the land of their father.</p>
<p> To show that Marciano alone killed the deceased, Maximo Enriquez,
barrio lieutenant of Cangmundo, testified that at about 9:00 o'clock
a.m. of 9 October 1944, Marciano Tortuga appeared at his house carrying
a bolo and a spear smeared with blood and told him that he had killed
Lorenzo Torreo'n and that he was surrendering the bolo and spear.
Thereupon, the barrio lieutenant kept Marciano under custody in his.
house and went to the place of Donato to inform him of the occurrence.
In the house he found Donato, Andres, Marcelino, Antonio Socias and
Martin Garcia taking their breakfast. The following day, Donato and his
sons Jose", Vicente, Marcelino and Andre's repaired to the house of the
barrio lieutenant and upon arriving there the guerrillas arrested and
took them to their camp in barrio Cruz and from there to another in
barrio Cantores. On their way to the latter place Marciano Tortuga was
shot and.killed by the soldiers when he attempted to run away. Later
on, Jose made good his escape.</p>
<p> It is hard to believe that on that occasion Marciano Tortuga would
arm himself with a bolo and spear, there being no evidence that he
anticipated a quarrel or fight. Granting that Maximo Enriquez saw
Marciano carrying a bolo and a spear smeared with blood, when the
latter came to his house to report that he had killed Lorenzo, it is
not improbable that after killing Lorenzo, Marciano took the spear from
his,brother Marcelino to relieve the latter from responsibility for his
part in the killing since at least one of them must answer for it. But
the testimony of Maximo Enriquez is not reliable because he is closely
related to the appellant, his mother being the sister of the
appellant's father. The 13 wounds inflicted upon and the seven bruises
suffered by the deceased could not have been caused by a single
individual. The claim that the testimony of the eyewitnesses for the
prosecution should not be believed, for there was no wound on the back
of the deceased which was caused by a spear, has no merit, because the
wound on the right side of the back of the deceased which was 2 inches
in length and 1 inch in width and penetrated into the abdomen, wider in
the center than at both ends, indicated that it might have been caused
by a spear.</p>
<p> That Marciano Tortuga killed the deceased because the latter
destroyed the growing corn on his field is not true. The motive was a
long standing feud between the deceased, on the one hand, and the
Tortuga family, on the other, which grew out of a controversy over the
ownership of a 75-hectare tract of land which was being plowed by the
farm hands engaged by the deceased on the day he met his untimely end.
It must be borne in mind that it was not the deceased who plowed the
land on the occasion of the occurrence but the farm hands whose
services he had engaged, so that if it was the destruction of, or the
damage to, Marciano's corn growing on his field that angered him, he
would have assaulted the farm hands and not the deceased who was on the
other side of the creek. The evidence shows that the Tortugas had to
cross the creek to assault the deceased. Marciano, on whom the whole
blame is laid, could not be the only one who assaulted Lorenzo Torreon,
because if that were the case, the farm hands of the latter would not
have been frightened and would not have run away but would have
rendered him help.</p>
<p> Lorenzo Torreon was around 60 years old when he was killed. The way
he was slain by an over-powering strength of a number of individuals
after he had put down his bolo clearly constitutes treachery because he
was not in a position to defend himself—his assailants employing means
in the execution of the crime which tended directly and specially to
insure its consummation without risk to them from the defense the
assaulted party might make. This qualifying circumstance absorbs the
aggravating circumstance of having taken advantage of superior
strength. The mere fact that the deceased was around 60 years of age is
not sufficient for the holding that the crime was committed in
disregard of the respect due the deceased on account of his age. The
crime was committed without regard to his</p>
<p> The crime is murder without the attendance of any aggravating or
mitigating circumstance. The penalty provided for in article 24$ of the
Revised Penal Code must be imposed in its medium period.</p>
<p> We find the appellant guilty of murder and sentence him to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
the accessories of the law, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in
the sum of P2,000 and to pay l/5 of the costs in the first instance and
the costs in the first instance and the costs in the instance.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is modified in the manner above stated.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Feria, Pablo, Bengzon, Tuason, Reyes, </em>and<em> Jugo, JJ.,</em> concur. <br> Mr. Justice <i>Montemayor</i> and Mr. Justice <i>Bautista Angelo</i> took no part.</p></div>
