				<H3>SUNRIPE COCONUT PRODUCTS CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND SUNRIPE COCONUT WORKERS' UNION (CLO), RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Industrial 
Relations holding that the "parers" and "shellers" of the petitioner, Sunripe 
Coconut Products Co., Inc., are its laborers entitled to twelve days sick leave 
(one day for each month of service), notwithstanding the fact that they are 
piece-workers under the "pakiao" system. The contention of the petitioner is 
that said "parers" and "shellers" are independent contractors and do not fall 
within the category of employees or laborers.
<p align="justify">The Court of Industrial Relations has relied upon the rule laid 
down in the case of Philadelphia Record Company, 69 N.L.R.B., 1232 (1946), to 
the effect that when a worker possesses some attributes of an employee and 
others of an independent contractor, which make him fall within an intermediate 
area, he may be classified under the category of an employee when the economic 
facts, of the relation make it more nearly one of employment than one of 
independent business enterprise with respect to the ends sought to be 
accomplished. Counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the correctness or 
applicability of the rule, but it is vigorously contended that, in the case at 
bar, the economic facts characteristic of the independent contractor far 
outweigh the economic facts indicative of an employee. We are not called upon to 
rule on the accuracy of petitioner's contention, since the conclusion of the 
Court of Industrial Relations on the matter is binding on this Court. In other 
words, the ruling that the "parers" and "shellers" have the status of empoyees 
or laborers, carries the factual verdict that the economic facts showing such 
status outweigh those indicative of an independent contractor. Some facts 
expressly invoked by the Court of Industrial Relations are: That the "parers" 
and "shellers" work under some degree of control or supervision of the company, 
if not under its absolute direction; that said "parers" and "shellers" form 
stable groups composed of matured men and women who regularly work at shelling 
and paring nuts; that for the most part they depend on their work in the Sunripe 
Coconut Products Co., Inc. for their livelihood; that they are admittedly 
working in the factory of said company, alongside persons who are indisputably 
employed by said company. As already stated, whether these specific facts are 
outweighed, as contended by the petitioner, by facts demonstrative of the status 
of an independent contractor, is a question decided adversely to the petitioner 
when the Court of Industrial Relations held that the "parers" and "shellers" are 
laborers or employees.</p>
<p align="justify">It is also pretended for the petitioner that the Court of 
Industrial Relations departed from the definition of the word "employee" or 
"laborer" found in the Workmen's Compensation Law, namely: " 'Laborer' is used 
as a synonym of 'employee', and it means every person who has entered the 
employment of, or works under a service or apprenticeship contract for, an 
employer. * * *" (Section 39 [b], Workmen's Compensation Law, as amended.) The 
Court of Industrial Relations of course adverted to the following definition: 
"An employee is any person in the service of another under a contract for hire, 
express or implied, oral or written." (Section 7, Labor Unions by Dangle and 
Scriber, p. 7, citing Mcdermott's Case, 283 Mass. 74; Werner vs. Industrial 
Comm., 212 Wis., 76.) In essence, however, the ruling of the Court of Industrial 
Relations does not run counter to the definition given in the Workmen's 
Compensation Law.</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for the petitioner have stressed the argument that the 
principal test in determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent 
contractor is the employer's right of control over the work, and not merely the 
right to control the result, it being intimated that the "parers" and "shellers" 
are controlled by the petitioner only to the extent "that the nuts are pared 
whole or that there is not much meat wasted." Even under the criterion adopted 
by the petitioner, it would not be amiss to state that the requirement imposed 
on the "parers" and "shellers" to the effect that "the nuts are pared whole or 
that there is not much meat wasted," in effect limits or controls the means or 
details by which said workers are to accomplish their services. It is 
inconceivable that the "parers" and "shellers", in order to meet the requirement 
of the petitioner, would not follow a uniform standard in the performance of 
their work.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner also insists that the "parers" and "shellers" are 
piece-workers under the "pakiao" system. In answer, suffice it to observe that 
Commonwealth Act No. 103, as amended, expressly provides that "A minimum wage or 
share shall be determined and fixed for laborers working by the hours, day or 
month, or by piece-work, and for tenants sharing in the crop or paid by 
measurement unit. * * *" (Section 5.) The organic law of the Court of Industrial 
Relations, therefore, even orders that laborers may be paid by piece-work; and 
for tenants are paid a fixed amount for a fixed number of nuts pared or shelled, 
does, not certainly take them out of the purview of Commonwealth Act No. 
103.</p>
<p align="justify">It is unnecessary to discuss at length the other facts pointed 
out by the petitioner in support of the proposition that said "parers" and 
"shellers" are independent contractors, because a ruling on the matter would 
necessarily involve a factual inquiry which we are not authorised to make. Even 
so, we would undertake to advance the general remark that in cases of this kind, 
wherein laborers are usually compelled to work under conditions and terms 
dictated by the employer, a reasonably wide lattitude of action and judgment 
should be given to the Court of Industrial Relations with a view to settling 
industrial disputes conformably to the intents and purposes of its organic law. 
Without in the least intimating that the relation between the "parers" and 
"shellers" on the one hand and the petitioner on the other, as planned but by 
the latter, was conceived knowingly to deprive said workers of the benefits 
accruing to workers who are admittedly employees or laborers under Commonwealth 
Act 103 or the Workmen's Compensation Law, it is not difficult to surmise that a 
contrary decision is likely to set a precedent that may tend to encourage the 
adoption of a similar scheme by many other or even all employers.</p>
<p align="justify">The appealed decision of the Court of Industrial Relations is 
therefore affirmed, with costs against the petitioner. So ordered.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>Moran, C.J., Pablo, Bengzon,</i> and <i>Reyes, JJ.</i>, 
concur.<br></p><p align="justify"><i>Tuason, J.</i>, concurs in the result.</p><p align="justify"><i>Montemayor, J.</i>, I reserve my vote.<br> </p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>CONCURRING</i></p>
<p align="justify">PERFECTO, <i>J.</i>: </p>
<p align="justify">We concur in the decision as penned by Mr. Justice Paras.</p>
<p align="justify">We believe that judicial notice can be taken of the fact that 
the so-called "pakyaw" system mentioned in this case, as generally practiced in 
our country, is, in fact, a labor contract between employers and employees, 
between capitalists and laborers. Under this system, the workers continue in the 
economic category of contract laborers. They do not acquire the character of 
owners or managers of an independent enterprise. The system is practiced only in 
labor contracts.</p>
<p align="justify">The "parers" and "shellers" in this case, according to the 
record, are subject to some degree of control or supervision by the company for 
which they are working, and that very fact characterizes them as employees or 
laborers, entering into the service of the company under a contract of hire or 
lease of services.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>CONFORME</i></p>
<p align="justify">BRIONES, <i>M.</i>:</p>
<p align="justify">Estoy conforme con la ponencia. Aunque los obreros interesados 
en este asunto trabajan bajo la forma de contrato Ilamada "pakyaw", esto es, se 
les paga la compensasion de su trabajo no mediante jornal sino a razon de la 
cuantia de la labor realizada, esto, sin embargo, es meramente incidental y se 
refiere solo a la forma de pago. Para todos los demas efectos y fines los 
obreros de que se trata forman parte de la organizacion de trabajadores afectos 
a la industria de la compañia recurrente. Si se tratase de obreros contratados 
bajo "pakyaw" de cuando en cuando, casualmente, seguh lo requieran la emergencia 
y las necesidades incidentales de la compañia, probablemente se podria sostener 
que no son obreros en el sentido legal de la palabra y, por tanto, sin derecho a 
reclamar los titulos y privilegios anejos a la condicion de obrero. Pero el 
presente caso es diferente. Aqui los obreros tienen una colocacion mas o menos 
permanente y forman parte, como digo, de la organizacion de la compañia al igual 
que los asalariados.</p>
<hr align="center" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">

<p align="center"><i>DISSENTING</i><b><br></b></p>FERIA, <i>J.</i>: 
<p align="justify">I dissent.</p>
<p align="justify">Under section 14 of Commonwealth Act No. 103, and Rule 44 of 
the Rules of Court, appeal by certiorari from the decrees, orders or decisions 
of the Court of Industrial Relations to the Supreme Court lies only in cases in 
which questions of law are involved in the appeal, and consequently this Court 
can not review said decrees, orders or decisions on questions of fact.</p>
<p align="justify">In all judicial cases, the justiciable question is always 
either one of fact and law, or of law only if the facts on which it is 
predicated are admitted or not in issue. It can never be a question of fact 
only, because the administration of justice consists in the application of the 
law to the facts of each case submitted to the Court for decision. The facts are 
the minor premise of the sylogism, the law applicable to them the major premise, 
and the conclusion drawn from the sylogism is the conclusion or finding of law, 
necessary for the decision of cases or lawsuit by the courts.</p>
<p align="justify">If the facts are admitted, and only the law applicable to the 
case and the conclusion of law to be drawn from such application is in issue in 
an appeal, the question involved is purely of law, and the Supreme Court has 
jurisdiction to review and pass upon the conclusions of law or findings of the 
Court of Industrial Relations. However, if not only the law applicable and, 
consequently, the inference or conclusion to be drawn from the application 
thereof, but the facts of the case as shown by the evidence are in issue, the 
question involved in an appeal is not of law but of fact, because no question of 
law may arise before the facts to which the law may be applied have been finally 
determined or found.</p>
<p align="justify">In the present appeal there is no question of law involved, 
because the question whether the "parers" or "shellers" have the status of 
employees or laborer in view of the facts of the case or the work they were 
bound to do, or the control the principal may or may not have over their work is 
a question of fact, or which "would necessarily involve a factual inquiry which 
we are not authorized to do," according to the very decision of the 
majority.</p>
<p align="justify">This Supreme Court has therefore no jurisdiction to review the 
decision of the Court of Industrial Relations because the appeal does involve 
not a question of law but of fact, and this Court has no power to review the 
findings of fact in the decision of the said Court of Industrial Relations. A 
decision of the said Court on questions of fact is final and not appealable.</p>
<p align="justify">We should have dismissed the petition for certiorari by way of 
appeal filed in this case from the start, and the fact that we have given it due 
course in order to determine whether or not appeal lies after hearing the 
adverse party, does not necessarily empower us to pass upon the merits of the 
appeal and affirm or reverse the decision appealed from. To affirm or reverse a 
judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations presupposes a review by us of the 
findings of fact on which it is based, which we have power to do in the present 
case.</p>
<p align="justify">Petition for certiorari by way of appeal is therefore 
dismissed. We can not review and affirm or reverse the decision of the Court of 
Industrial Relations in this case. So ordered.</p></div>
