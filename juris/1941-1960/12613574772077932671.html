				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioner&nbsp; Andres de la&nbsp; Cerna, a&nbsp; civil&nbsp; service eligible, was on July&nbsp; 1, 1946 appointed&nbsp; by the Mayor of the City of Cebu,&nbsp; as&nbsp; a detective&nbsp; in the&nbsp; city&nbsp; police department. For&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; "grave misconduct,&nbsp; serious&nbsp; irregularity in the performance of his duty, and violation; of law&nbsp; and duty," he&nbsp; was administratively charged before the Municipal Board of the City of&nbsp; Cebu in Case No. 22, entitled "Vicente S. del Rosario, as Mayor of Cebu, complainant <i>vs.</i> Andres de la Cerna, respondent", and was suspended on June 7, 1953.&nbsp; On August 7, 1953, after the expiration of the 60-day period from&nbsp; the date of his&nbsp; suspension, he wrote the&nbsp; City Mayor stating that&nbsp; pursuant to the provisions of&nbsp; Republic Act No. 557&nbsp; he&nbsp; should be reinstated in the service.&nbsp; On October 10, 1953, he received a letter from&nbsp; the&nbsp; Acting Mayor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; City of&nbsp; Cebu, advising him that his&nbsp; position had been abolished in the 1953-1954 General Fund Budget&nbsp; for the City and that his services in the police department were being terminated upon his receipt thereof.<br><br>On&nbsp; May 5, 1956, de la&nbsp; Cerna commenced these proceedings by means of a petition for mandamus filed with the Court&nbsp; of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of Cebu with a view to having said court compel the respondents in said petition, namely: the City Mayor, members of the municipal board, the city treasurer&nbsp; and the&nbsp; city auditor&nbsp; to reinstate him to his position in the city police force and&nbsp; to pay his salary in arrears from the&nbsp; expiration of the 60-day period from the date of his suspension.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondents in said case answered the petition and later&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a motion&nbsp; to dismiss.&nbsp; Acting upon&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion, the&nbsp; trial court, citing our&nbsp; decision in the case of Severino Unabia <i>vs.</i> the City Mayor of Cebu, et al., 99&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 258,&nbsp;&nbsp; dismissed the petition by&nbsp; order of September 11, 1956.&nbsp; A&nbsp; motion&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration of the said&nbsp; order of&nbsp; dismissal was&nbsp; filed&nbsp; and the trial court&nbsp; by order of&nbsp; January 28,1957,&nbsp; denied the motion. Both orders are now before&nbsp; us on appeal.<br><br>In his petition for mandamus,&nbsp; dated May 5, 1956, as well as&nbsp; in&nbsp; his amended petition,&nbsp; dated June&nbsp; 26, 1956, petitioner-appellant&nbsp; alleged that Administrative Case No. 22 of the municipal board of the City of Cebu was still pending&nbsp; investigation and awaiting judgment or decision. On the other&nbsp; hand, in&nbsp; their&nbsp; answer&nbsp; to&nbsp; his&nbsp; petition for mandamus, respondents therein equally alleged that in said Administrative Case No. 22, petitioner-appellant&nbsp; was found guilty of the charges and&nbsp; as a result the municipal board dismissed him from the service.&nbsp;&nbsp; For lack of evidence, we are&nbsp; unable to&nbsp; make a&nbsp; finding on this controverted point, not&nbsp; knowing&nbsp; which of the conflicting allegations should be accepted.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is a fact that appellant's position was duly abolished and that due to said abolitions, he was separated from the service on October 10,&nbsp; 1953, and as already stated, he filed&nbsp; this action for reinstatement and&nbsp; for&nbsp; the payment of back salaries, only on May 10, 1956, after a period of almost three years.<br><br>Following the doctrine laid&nbsp; down in the case of Unabia <i>vs.</i> City Mayor, <i>supra</i>, and other cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> where&nbsp; we&nbsp; held that "any person claiming right to a&nbsp; position in&nbsp; the civil service should also be required&nbsp; to&nbsp; file&nbsp; his petition&nbsp; for reinstatement&nbsp; within the period&nbsp; of&nbsp; one year, otherwise he is thereby&nbsp; considered as having abandoned&nbsp; his office", we find&nbsp; no&nbsp; error in the two&nbsp; appealed orders, and, consequently,&nbsp; hereby affirm the same.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><i>Paras, C.
