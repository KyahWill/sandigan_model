				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for certiorari filed by Sun Un&nbsp; Giok, owner of&nbsp; a theater in La Carlota, Negros Occidental, seeking to annul the order of Judge Jose Teodoro, Sr., of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance of said province,&nbsp; dated&nbsp; January 26, 1956,&nbsp; denying petitioner's motion to lift&nbsp; order of default and to vacate judgment rendered in&nbsp; Civil Case No. 3428 of said court.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts of the case may be summarized as&nbsp; follows: <br><br>On&nbsp; July&nbsp; 1, 1955,&nbsp; an amended complaint was filed by Hermogenes Matusa&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Court of&nbsp; First&nbsp; Instance of&nbsp; Negros&nbsp; Occidental against Sun Un Giok, as&nbsp; owner and manager of the Idelco&nbsp; Theater&nbsp; located&nbsp; in said municipality of&nbsp; La Carlota, alleging among other&nbsp; things,&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had been employed&nbsp; in said theater as&nbsp; gate-keeper from November 1,&nbsp; 1848, up to December 1, 1954;&nbsp; that he&nbsp; had rendered services&nbsp; for 8 hours&nbsp; on ordinary days and for&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp; hours&nbsp; on Saturdays, Sundays and&nbsp; holidays throughout&nbsp; the duration&nbsp; of said&nbsp; employment&nbsp; without being given the corresponding overtime compensation in accordance with the 8 Hour Labor Law; that he was&nbsp; paid a salary below the amount fixed by the Minimum Wage Law;&nbsp; that&nbsp; defendant, in order to&nbsp; defraud&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff of&nbsp; his just wages&nbsp; and .to circumvent&nbsp; the&nbsp; provisions of the law,&nbsp;&nbsp; kept daily time records and payrolls which he knew to be&nbsp; contrary to&nbsp; facts; that the ldelco Theater had more than 6 individuals in its&nbsp; employ,&nbsp; and prayed&nbsp; that after due&nbsp; hearing, judgment be rendered ordering 'defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P2,897.82&nbsp; as the total balance of his salary underpaid, with&nbsp; interest at 6 per cent&nbsp; per&nbsp; annum on&nbsp; said&nbsp; amount&nbsp; until the&nbsp; whole&nbsp; sum is paid, plus the additional&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of 10 per cent&nbsp; of&nbsp; the total&nbsp; amount for attorney's fees; for moral damages&nbsp; in the sum of P10,000; for nominal&nbsp; damages in accordance with&nbsp; Articles&nbsp; 2221 and 2222&nbsp; of the&nbsp; New Civil Code; exemplary&nbsp; or&nbsp; correctional damages&nbsp; in accordance with Articles 2229 and 2230 of the same Code; and&nbsp; for such other relief as may be deemed&nbsp; just&nbsp; and equitable under the circumstances. <br><br>The corresponding summons was&nbsp; served&nbsp; on defendant on <i>September 8,&nbsp; 1955</i>,&nbsp; and on the following day, counsel for Sun Un Giok filed&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion to dismiss&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint and&nbsp; amended&nbsp; complaint on&nbsp; the ground that&nbsp; the cause of action was already barred by the&nbsp; statute of limitations because plaintiff&nbsp; was asking for the recovery of underpaid salaries&nbsp; from November 1, 1946, to December&nbsp; 1,&nbsp; 1954, when&nbsp; under&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 16&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Minimum&nbsp; Wage&nbsp; Law, an&nbsp; action&nbsp; must&nbsp; be commenced&nbsp; within&nbsp; three years after the cause of action accrued; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the Court had&nbsp; no jurisdiction over&nbsp; the subject matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was&nbsp; contended that defendant, as managing partner of said moviehouse, employed&nbsp; regularly only&nbsp; four&nbsp; employees&nbsp; and&nbsp; hired&nbsp; occasionally&nbsp; one&nbsp; more, and, therefore, granting that plaintiff actually received a&nbsp; salary below&nbsp; the amount&nbsp; provided for by&nbsp; the Minimum&nbsp; Wage Law, said law can not be invoked in the case at bar because retail or&nbsp; service establishments that regularly employ less than five employees are exempted from the operation&nbsp; of the Minimum Wage Law.&nbsp; This pleading&nbsp; (motion&nbsp; to dismiss)&nbsp; contains&nbsp; the following notice&nbsp; addressed&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Clerk of Court: <br><blockquote>"The Clerk of Court <br>Court&nbsp; of First Instance <br>Bacolod&nbsp; City, Philippines <br>Greetings: <br><br>Please submit&nbsp; the foregoing Motion&nbsp; to Dismiss Complaint&nbsp; and Amended Complaint for the proper consideration of the.&nbsp; Honorable Court <i>and as soon as thereafter as counsel can be heard</i>. <br><br><div style="margin-left: 240px;">(Sgd.)&nbsp;&nbsp; ALFONSO&nbsp; CRISOSTOMO<br></div><br>"I hereby certify that I have sent a copy of the foregoing motion&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp; Attorney&nbsp; Pio&nbsp; Tan,&nbsp; Counsel for the plaintiff&nbsp; this 9th day of September,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; by&nbsp; registered&nbsp; mail&nbsp; as evidenced by&nbsp; Registry Receipt No. 703 hereto attached, at Sibalom, Antique. <br><br><div style="margin-left: 240px;">(Sgd.)&nbsp; ALFONSO CIUSOSTOMO" </div></blockquote>The records&nbsp; further&nbsp; show&nbsp; that said motion was set for hearing on&nbsp; Saturday, September&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; before Branch II of the Court of First Instance of&nbsp; Nogros Occidental (Annex&nbsp; "D") although plaintiff Hermogenes Matusa&nbsp; avers&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; not notified&nbsp; of said&nbsp; hearing. Counsel for plaintiff did&nbsp; not&nbsp; appear,&nbsp; but&nbsp; as&nbsp; defendant, who was properly represented, was not&nbsp; able&nbsp; to&nbsp; present proof of service on&nbsp; the adverse party, the&nbsp; Court deferred action on the motion to dismiss and issued&nbsp; an order dated September 24, 1955, postponing consideration on the same "until&nbsp; proof can be shown that&nbsp; attorney&nbsp; for&nbsp; the plaintiff <i>has received a copy of said motion to dismiss</i>"&nbsp;&nbsp; Hermogenes Matusa received a copy of this order of postponement, but before counsel for defendant could present the required proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; service, counsel&nbsp; for plaintiff filed&nbsp; a motion to&nbsp; declare&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; in default which was&nbsp; granted by&nbsp; order&nbsp; of the Court of October 15,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; and consequently, the&nbsp; Court received&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; evidence and&nbsp; judgment was&nbsp; rendered thereon.<br><br>Upon receipt of&nbsp; a copy of said&nbsp; decision, counsel for defendant filed a motion to&nbsp; lift order of default and&nbsp; to vacate judgment dated&nbsp; November 28, 1955, advancing the argument that defendant&nbsp; should&nbsp; not have been declared&nbsp; in default because there was a motion to dismiss pending&nbsp; consideration&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; which&nbsp; suspended&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; within which to file an answer; that the&nbsp; Court had not resolved&nbsp; this&nbsp; motion because it&nbsp; required&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; to&nbsp; produce proof&nbsp; that&nbsp; the adverse&nbsp; party had received&nbsp; said&nbsp; pleading, and said&nbsp; requirement was&nbsp; not complied&nbsp; with at&nbsp; once because the return card&nbsp; evidencing receipt&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; pleading was not yet forwarded to him&nbsp; by the post office&nbsp; of Sibalom,&nbsp; Antique;&nbsp; that&nbsp; upon&nbsp; receipt of&nbsp; said&nbsp; card he immediately wanted to file the&nbsp; same but&nbsp; found out that he wag already declared&nbsp; in default; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; ruling in the case&nbsp; of Manakel vs. Revilla&nbsp; which pronounced that where no notice of hearing is served upon the plaintiff the pleading becomes&nbsp; a&nbsp; mere scrap of paper which the Clerk of Court should not have received for filing, should not be' made&nbsp; applicable&nbsp; to&nbsp; the instant ease, because&nbsp; plaintiff <i>was notified of the hearing of said motion and was likewise furnished with copy of the order of the Court postponing consideration on the motion to dismiss</i> and was aware of the existence&nbsp; of said&nbsp; hearing.&nbsp; Defendant,&nbsp; therefore,&nbsp; prayed that the order of&nbsp; default be lifted; that the judgment of November 14, 1955, vacated;&nbsp; that&nbsp; a date be set for the hearing&nbsp; of&nbsp; the motion to dismiss&nbsp; and for such&nbsp; other relief that may be deemed proper&nbsp; in the premises. <br>&nbsp;<br>By order of January 26,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; the Court denied this motion&nbsp; and ordered that the&nbsp; writ&nbsp; of execution of judgment,&nbsp; prayed for by plaintiff, be&nbsp; issued.&nbsp; A motion for the reconsideration of&nbsp; said order dated February&nbsp; 6, 1956, having&nbsp; been denied by order&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Court of February 14, 1956, defendant Sun Un Giok filed the present petition for certiorari&nbsp; with preliminary injunction praying that respondent&nbsp; Judge, Hon. Jose&nbsp; Teodoro, Sr.,&nbsp; be&nbsp; restrained from taking any further steps&nbsp; concerning the instant ease; that the Provincial&nbsp; Sheriff of Negros Occidental or any of his deputies&nbsp; be orderde to refrain from&nbsp; enforcing the writ of execution&nbsp; already issued by the respondent&nbsp; Judge and from taking&nbsp; possession&nbsp; of the apparatus and equipment of the Idelco Theater for the purpose&nbsp; of selling the same at public auction; and&nbsp; that after hearing, the order of&nbsp; the respondent Judge denying&nbsp; the motion to lift the order&nbsp; cf&nbsp; default&nbsp; and&nbsp; to vacate&nbsp; judgment be declared null and void. <br>&nbsp;<br>By resolution of&nbsp; February&nbsp; 22,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; this Court&nbsp; gave due course&nbsp; to the petition and issued&nbsp; the&nbsp; writ of preliminary&nbsp; injunction prayed&nbsp; for by petitioner&nbsp; upon approval of the required&nbsp; bond of P2,000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the reglamentary period,&nbsp; Hermogenes Matusa&nbsp; filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; answer admitting that he had received a copy of the "Motion to Dismiss&nbsp; Complaint&nbsp; and&nbsp; Amended&nbsp; Complaint" filed&nbsp; by counsel for&nbsp; petitioner, but contending that said defective pleading was&nbsp; merely a scrap&nbsp; of&nbsp; paper because it failed to comply with the essential&nbsp; requisites&nbsp; provided&nbsp; for&nbsp; by sections&nbsp; 4 and 5 of Rule 26 of the Rules of&nbsp; Court, for said pleading&nbsp; contained&nbsp; no notice of&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; and should not be considered a motion at all; that the Clerk of Court should not have accepted and included the same&nbsp; in the calendar of the Court; that this error on the&nbsp; part of the Clerk&nbsp; did not produce a remedial effect&nbsp; to the prejudice of the adverse party; that the defective pleading remained to be&nbsp; a&nbsp; useless scrap of paper&nbsp; attached to&nbsp; the&nbsp; records, the&nbsp; requirement that notice&nbsp; of hearing&nbsp; be&nbsp; served&nbsp; on the adverse party&nbsp; still being&nbsp; uncomplied with; that the Court&nbsp; had nothing&nbsp; to resolve because what was&nbsp; before it&nbsp; was not&nbsp; a&nbsp; motion at&nbsp; all;&nbsp; that said party&nbsp; was aware of the order of the Court postponing action&nbsp; on the supposed&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to dismiss but he was&nbsp; also&nbsp; aware&nbsp; that said order&nbsp; could&nbsp; never&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp; complied with&nbsp; as no notice of such hearing was ever sent to himself or&nbsp; his counsel; and&nbsp; that respondent has the right&nbsp; to rely on the Rules of Court instead of being bound to wait indefinitely for proof&nbsp; of a non-existent notice to&nbsp; be produced; hence after 30 days&nbsp; had&nbsp; elapsed, he filed a motion&nbsp; to&nbsp; declare therein plaintiff in default. <br><br>From&nbsp; the foregoing facts, it is clear that the question in the case at&nbsp; bar revolves&nbsp; on&nbsp; whether the&nbsp; notice&nbsp; incorporated in&nbsp; said (pleading is sufficient under sections 4 and&nbsp; 5 of Rule 26&nbsp; of the Rules of Court, and granting that it is defective, whether the Clerk&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court in&nbsp; including the&nbsp; same for hearing on September 24, 1955, and the Court in taking cognizance of the same to the extent of ordering the postponement of the hearing thereof until certain requirements were complied&nbsp; with, did in effect cure whatever omission counsel for&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; might have committed&nbsp; in&nbsp; connection&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp;&nbsp; motion&nbsp; to dismiss. <br>&nbsp;<br>Counsel for respondent in advancing its defense relied on these sections of Rule 26 of the Rules of Court:&nbsp; <br><blockquote>Sec. 4. Notice.—Notice of motion shall be served by the applicant to all parties&nbsp; concerned, at least three&nbsp; days&nbsp; before the hearing' thereof,&nbsp; together with a copy of the&nbsp; motion and of&nbsp; any affidavits . and other papers accompanying it.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court, however, for good cause&nbsp; may hear a motion on shorter notice, specially on matters which the court may dispense of&nbsp; on its own. <br>&nbsp;<br>Sec. 5. Contents of notice.—The notice shall be directed to&nbsp; the parties&nbsp; concerned,&nbsp; and&nbsp; shall state the time and&nbsp; place&nbsp; for&nbsp; the hearing&nbsp; of the motion. </blockquote>From&nbsp; the&nbsp; aforequoted&nbsp; sections,&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; required that notice of a motion directed to the parties concerned, must be served by the movant stating therein the time and place for the hearing of the&nbsp; said&nbsp; motion.&nbsp; Counsel for defendant in addressing&nbsp; the&nbsp; notice to the Clerk of Court requesting&nbsp; that&nbsp; said motion be&nbsp; submitted for&nbsp; the "consideration of the Honorable Court <i>and an soon as thereafter as counsel can be heard</i>", and at the&nbsp; same time certifying that&nbsp; he had&nbsp; sent a copy&nbsp; of the motion to&nbsp; counsel for therein plaintiff, such notice seems to substantially comply with&nbsp; the requirement&nbsp; of&nbsp; section 5&nbsp; of Rule&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; for&nbsp; in virtue&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; notice,&nbsp; the hearing&nbsp; was actually&nbsp; set&nbsp; by Clerk&nbsp; of Court for&nbsp; September&nbsp; 24,&nbsp; 1955,&nbsp; of which,&nbsp; We can presume, counsel for respondent Hermogenes Matusa was notified.&nbsp; Respondents banked on the ruling laid down in the&nbsp; case of&nbsp; Manakil vs. Revilla, 42&nbsp; Phil.&nbsp; 81,&nbsp; but the pronouncement&nbsp; therein is based&nbsp; on the provision&nbsp; of section 6&nbsp; of the same Rule 26, which reads&nbsp; as follows: <br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Proof of service, to be riled with motion.—No motion shall be acted upon by&nbsp; the Court,&nbsp; without proof of service of the notice thereof. </blockquote>It was in&nbsp; virtue&nbsp; of this requisite&nbsp; of&nbsp; proof of&nbsp; service that the trial court,&nbsp; in its order of&nbsp; September 24, 1955, deferred action on the motion&nbsp; to dismiss, postponing the same indefinitely until counsel for&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; could produce the necessary evidence&nbsp; that adverse party was&nbsp; furnished&nbsp; with&nbsp; copy&nbsp; of&nbsp; said motion,&nbsp; despite&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that defendant's attorney certified that a copy of said pleading was sent by registered mail&nbsp; to adverse&nbsp; party and even attached to&nbsp; it&nbsp; the registry&nbsp; receipt&nbsp; thereof.&nbsp; The&nbsp; case of Manakil&nbsp; vs.&nbsp; Revilla, <i>supra</i> enunciated that notice&nbsp; of motions is necessary,&nbsp; and without proof of service thereof, a motion is nothing but a useless piece of&nbsp; paper which the' clerk should not&nbsp; receive&nbsp; for filing,&nbsp; but the facts&nbsp; of the case at&nbsp; bar are quite&nbsp; different. <br><br>But let us grant, for&nbsp; the sake&nbsp; of&nbsp; argument, that' the notice in question, as quoted above is defective, for failure to&nbsp; specify&nbsp; the&nbsp; exact&nbsp; date when that motion&nbsp; should&nbsp; be heard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even&nbsp; so,&nbsp; We&nbsp; believe&nbsp; that the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; in&nbsp; taking cognizance&nbsp; of&nbsp; the motion on the&nbsp; date&nbsp; set&nbsp; for&nbsp; hearing thereof, cured whatever iota of defect such pleading&nbsp; may have had, specially if it&nbsp; is taken into account&nbsp; that upon receipt&nbsp; of the&nbsp; motion to dismiss, plaintiff was properly notified&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of said&nbsp; pleading.&nbsp;&nbsp; Counsel for plaintiff&nbsp; should not&nbsp; have relied on&nbsp; mere&nbsp; technicalities which in the interest of justice may be relaxed&nbsp; for it was said that: <br><blockquote>"A litigation&nbsp; is not&nbsp; a game of&nbsp; technicalities&nbsp; in&nbsp; which&nbsp; one, more deeply&nbsp; schooled&nbsp; and skilled&nbsp; in&nbsp; the subtle art of movement and position, entraps and&nbsp; destroys the other".&nbsp; Alonso vs. Villamor, 16 Phil.&nbsp; 815.) <br><br>"As&nbsp; the motion was&nbsp; heard after&nbsp; this notice,&nbsp; and&nbsp; strictly&nbsp; in compliance with the Rules of Court, it cannot be&nbsp; said that the hearing was&nbsp; held without due&nbsp; process of law.&nbsp; <i>What&nbsp; the&nbsp; law prohibits&nbsp; in not the absence&nbsp; of previous notice, by the&nbsp; absolute absence thereof and&nbsp; lack&nbsp; of opportunity to&nbsp; be&nbsp; heard</i>".&nbsp;&nbsp; (Borja&nbsp; vs. Tan, 93&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 167;&nbsp; Duran Embate vs. Penolio, 93&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 782,&nbsp; 49 Off.&nbsp; Gaz. [9]&nbsp; 8850).</blockquote>Parties litigants shall&nbsp; not be&nbsp; deprived of their&nbsp; day&nbsp; in court as it&nbsp; was done&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case at bar. <br><br>Wherefore, the Court hereby grants the petition for cetiorari prayed for by&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; and the questioned order of default and decision rendered by the respondent Court in the absence&nbsp; of the defendant in Civil Case No. 3423 of the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of First Instance of&nbsp; Negros Occidental,&nbsp; are hereby set aside and&nbsp; left without force and effect.&nbsp; The respondent Court is further ordered to hear and pass upon the motion to dismiss filed by defendant and to proceed with said case&nbsp; until&nbsp; it is finally. disposed&nbsp; of in that instance. The writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction issued herein, is made permanent,&nbsp; with&nbsp; costs&nbsp;&nbsp; against&nbsp; respondent&nbsp; Hermogenes Matusa.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; so ordered. <br><br><i>Paras, C.
