				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Jose G. de Castro&nbsp; appeals from&nbsp; a&nbsp; judgment of the Court of&nbsp; First Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila ordering him&nbsp; to pay the plaintiff the sum "of P30,547.71, with legal interest thereon&nbsp; from the&nbsp; filing of the complaint until&nbsp; fully paid, plus 10%&nbsp; of the total&nbsp; amount due as attorney's fees and costs of&nbsp; collection, and&nbsp; the costs."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Civil No.&nbsp; 27545.)&nbsp;&nbsp; In his notice of appeal,&nbsp; he&nbsp; states that he "appeals from the decision rendered on&nbsp; January 2, 1957, a copy of&nbsp; which was received on January 11 of the same&nbsp; year,&nbsp; to the&nbsp; Hon. Supreme Court of the Philippines&nbsp; as the issues involved herein are purely questions of law&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *."<br><br>The facts, as found by the trial court, are <br><blockquote>* *&nbsp; * *&nbsp; That sometime on&nbsp; June&nbsp; 7,&nbsp; 1949,&nbsp; the&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; bought from&nbsp; the&nbsp; PRATRA, plaintiff's predecessor-in-interest, two&nbsp; International Model&nbsp; TD-18 Tractors with&nbsp; dozer,&nbsp; serial&nbsp; Nos. 6928 and 5642, for the total sum of P38,000.00; that&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; evidence in support of this&nbsp; transaction consists of a copy of a&nbsp; letter&nbsp; (Exhibit B), dated June&nbsp; 8, 1949, of the General Manager of the PRATRA, authorizing E. S. Baltao&nbsp; &amp; Company&nbsp; to deliver to defendant&nbsp; the aforesaid tractors; that defendant made&nbsp; a down payment of P15,200.00 an the&nbsp; said purchase, thereby leaving&nbsp; a balance of P22,800.00; that to&nbsp; secure&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; latter&nbsp; amount,&nbsp; defendant executed&nbsp; a promissory note, dated&nbsp; June&nbsp; 7, 1949,&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; said amount&nbsp; of P22,800.00&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; C);&nbsp; that as&nbsp; defendant failed to comply with the&nbsp; terms and conditions&nbsp; of the said&nbsp; promissory note,&nbsp; plaintiff's predecessor-in-interest sent to defendant&nbsp; demand&nbsp; letters&nbsp; dated May 2, 1953, June 14, 1954 and&nbsp; February 12, 1955&nbsp; (Exhibits D, D-2 and D-4, respectively);&nbsp; that&nbsp; defendant's&nbsp; wife Miguela&nbsp; B.&nbsp; de Castro, answered the said letters on May 15,&nbsp; 1953, June&nbsp; 25,&nbsp; 1954&nbsp; and July 18,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; (Exhibits&nbsp; D-1, D-3 and D-5) ;&nbsp; that&nbsp; in the exhibits just mentioned, said defendant's indebtedness is admitted and extensions of&nbsp; time were asked therein to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; same on the&nbsp; ground&nbsp; of alleged financial reverses;&nbsp; that&nbsp; as of&nbsp; July 11, 1956, the&nbsp; principal of&nbsp; defendant's indebtedness was P22,800.00 and&nbsp; the&nbsp; stipulated interest&nbsp; thereon was P11,227.71 or a total&nbsp; of P34,027.71;&nbsp; that of the said amount,&nbsp; defendant has only paid&nbsp; P3,480.00; which was applied to the payment of interest, thus leaving&nbsp; an outstanding balance&nbsp; in the amount of P30.547.71 as of July&nbsp; 11, 1956 (Exhibit A),&nbsp; and that under&nbsp; the&nbsp; promissory note,&nbsp; Exhibit C, in case&nbsp; of default&nbsp; in the payment of&nbsp; the said principal&nbsp; and interest,&nbsp; defendant shall pay to plaintiff the additional sum of 10% of the total amount due&nbsp; as attorney's fees&nbsp; and costs&nbsp; of collection.<br><br>After plaintiff presented its evidence above summarized on July 11, 1956, it rested its case, and this&nbsp; Court re-set the continuation of the&nbsp; trial&nbsp; on August&nbsp; 10,&nbsp; 1956 to&nbsp; afford the&nbsp; defendant an opportunity to&nbsp; present his evidence.&nbsp; On this latter date, defendant failed&nbsp; to appear&nbsp; when&nbsp; the case&nbsp; was&nbsp; called for&nbsp; trial,&nbsp;&nbsp; so&nbsp; this Court&nbsp;&nbsp; considered the&nbsp; case&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; decision on&nbsp; plaintiffs evidence.&nbsp; However, on subsequent motion of&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for defendant to set&nbsp; aside&nbsp; the said order of this&nbsp; Court,&nbsp; an&nbsp; the ground that he is trying to&nbsp; settle this&nbsp; case amicably&nbsp; with plaintiff,&nbsp; which motion was opposed"&nbsp; by counsel for plaintiff, this Court, on&nbsp; August&nbsp; 27, 1956, gave&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; a&nbsp; period of twenty&nbsp; days from notice&nbsp; to inform&nbsp; this&nbsp; Court&nbsp; of the status of&nbsp; his&nbsp; alleged&nbsp; negotiation with plaintiff for the amicable settlement&nbsp; of this case,&nbsp; failing which this Court&nbsp; will consider&nbsp; the&nbsp; case submitted for decision&nbsp; an plaintiff's evidence.&nbsp; On&nbsp; September&nbsp; 17,&nbsp; 1956,&nbsp; counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; defendant filed&nbsp; a manisfestation&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; negotiation&nbsp; was&nbsp; still going&nbsp; on. On October 22,&nbsp; 1956, this Court issued another order&nbsp; giving the parties five&nbsp; days from&nbsp; notice to&nbsp; state whether or not&nbsp; the amicable settlement of the&nbsp; case would&nbsp; go through.&nbsp;&nbsp; On October&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 1956, counsel for defendant filed another manifestation to the effect that he expects the amicable&nbsp; agreement to materialize,&nbsp; but on October 29, 1956, counsel for plaintiff&nbsp; also&nbsp; filed&nbsp; a manifestation to the&nbsp; effect that defendant's offer or settlement could not be accepted by plaintiff because&nbsp; said defendant&nbsp; was not&nbsp; even able to make partial payment&nbsp; of his indebtedness, so counsel for&nbsp; plaintiff prays&nbsp; that this case be decided on plaintiff's evidence.&nbsp; On&nbsp; November&nbsp; 7, 1956, counsel for defendant filed a motion&nbsp; asking&nbsp; that&nbsp; the parties be given&nbsp; further&nbsp; opportunity to compromise the case, and on&nbsp; November 10, 1956, this Court granted them twenty days for that purpose. On December 5, 1956, counsel&nbsp; for&nbsp; defendant asked for&nbsp; another period of time to submit&nbsp; the said&nbsp; compromise&nbsp; agreement, but in view of the fact that the said motion does not bear the conformity of counsel for plaintiff,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the further fact that his case has been dragging on&nbsp; for an unreasonable period of time, the said motion was denied and the case was considered submitted for decision upon plaintiff's evidence, hence&nbsp; this decision.<br></blockquote>The Philippine Relief and Trade Rehabilitation Administration (PRATRA)&nbsp; was&nbsp; dissolved on 3&nbsp; October 1950&nbsp; and its "personnel, records, properties, equipment, assets, rights, choses in action, obligations, liabilities, and contracts were transferred to, vested in and assumed by the Price Stabilization Croporation&nbsp; (PRISCO).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter was dissolved on 17 June&nbsp; 1955 and&nbsp; its "personnel,&nbsp; records, cash,&nbsp; such needed equipment, rights and contracts&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; * involving real estate, fixed assets&nbsp; and stock in trade," were transferred to the National Marketing Corporation&nbsp; (NAMARCO).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On 28 January 1957 the appellant filed a motion for new trial&nbsp; in the lower court on the ground that the judgment was rendered&nbsp; by mistake because&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; deprived&nbsp; of the opportunity&nbsp; to present&nbsp; his evidence;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; he and his counsel failed to arrive in Court&nbsp; on time in the morning of 10 August 1956, the&nbsp; day set&nbsp; for the&nbsp; presentation of his evidence, because&nbsp; of heavy traffic&nbsp; on the way from Quezon City, where he resides,&nbsp; to Manila.&nbsp; As no&nbsp; affidavit of merit was&nbsp; attached to the motion for new trial, as provided for in sections 1 and 2 of Rule 37, the motion was correctly denied.<br><br>The Court has afforded&nbsp; the appellant&nbsp; the opportunity to present&nbsp; evidence in his behalf.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 27 August 1956, the Court,&nbsp; upon motion&nbsp; of the&nbsp; appellant, and over&nbsp; the objection of the appellee, set aside its verbal order of 10 August; considered the case submitted for decision on the basis of the appellee's evidence alone; and granted the appellant&nbsp; twenty days&nbsp; from receipt&nbsp; of notice to&nbsp; inform the Court of the status of his alleged negotiation with the appellee for an amicable settlement of the&nbsp; case.&nbsp; On 17 September the appellant filed a manifestation informing the Court&nbsp; that he was&nbsp; awaiting the favorable&nbsp; reply&nbsp; of the appellee to his proposals for amicable&nbsp; settlement of the case.&nbsp; On 22 October&nbsp; the Court entered an order directing the parties to state within&nbsp; five days from receipt of notice&nbsp; whether or&nbsp; not the&nbsp; proposed amicable settlement would&nbsp; materialize so that it could&nbsp; take the proper action to terminate the&nbsp; case.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 27 October the appellant filed a&nbsp; manifestation&nbsp; informing&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; proposed amicable settlement was&nbsp; still under negotiation&nbsp; and consideration by the appellee.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 29 October the appellee informed&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court that its Board of&nbsp; Directors had&nbsp; rejected&nbsp; the appellant's offer&nbsp; of amicable settlement because its terms&nbsp; were unacceptable and prayed that judgment be rendered&nbsp; on the&nbsp; basis of the evidence it has&nbsp; presented. According to the Court, on&nbsp; 7 November the appellant filed a&nbsp; motion praying that the parties be granted&nbsp; further opportunity to settle the case amicably and on 10 November it granted&nbsp; them twenty days&nbsp; for that purpose.&nbsp; On 5 December the&nbsp; appellant filed a&nbsp; motion praying that the period of twenty days set&nbsp; by the Court for&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties to settle the case amicably&nbsp; be extended to January 1957, because the amended proposal he had&nbsp; submitted was still under&nbsp; consideration by the&nbsp; appellee, and that&nbsp; as evidence of his&nbsp; sincerity to settle the case amicably, he had offered and the manager of the appellee&nbsp; had&nbsp; accepted payment of P2,000 pending acceptance and consideration of his offer.&nbsp; On&nbsp; 6&nbsp; December&nbsp; the Court&nbsp; denied the appellant's motion for extension of the period&nbsp; to submit a compromise agreement because it&nbsp; did not&nbsp; bear the&nbsp; consent of the appellee and considered the&nbsp; case&nbsp; submitted for decision upon&nbsp; the evidence already&nbsp; presented.&nbsp;&nbsp; On 2 January 1957 the Court rendered judgment which is now the subject of this appeal. It is not, therefore, correct&nbsp; to say&nbsp; that the&nbsp; appellee had been deprived of&nbsp; his day in court.<br><br>Furthermore,&nbsp; in his answer to the appellee's complaint, he merely alleged that "he has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth&nbsp; of the matters contained in paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 so much so that&nbsp; he denies specifically said allegations."&nbsp;&nbsp; A denial&nbsp; is not specific simply because it is so qualified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(1)</sup>&nbsp; Material averments&nbsp; in a complaint, other than those as to the amount of damage, are deemed admitted&nbsp; when&nbsp; not specifically denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(2)</sup>&nbsp; The court may render judgment&nbsp; upon the pleadings if material averments in the complaint are admitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(3)</sup><br><br>The judgment&nbsp; appealed from&nbsp; is affirmed,&nbsp; with costs against the appellant.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp; C.
