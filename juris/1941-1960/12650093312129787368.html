				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On&nbsp; November 27, 1954,&nbsp; Bias Buela, his wife Josefina Borromeo, and their only son were living in the barrio of San Antonio, Municipality of Libon,&nbsp; Albay.&nbsp; That&nbsp; day, Josefina took her&nbsp; son to the Municipality of Tabaco&nbsp; for medical treatment, leaving her husband Bias alone at home. In the house&nbsp; there was a quantity of palay&nbsp; (known&nbsp; as "dinorado") placed in four containers, namely two buri bags, locally known as&nbsp; "<span style="font-style: italic;">bayong</span>", one sack and one box.&nbsp; When Josefina returned home on November 29, she found that her husband had been killed and the house robbed. She saw the bloody' dead body of Bias on the ground, about ten meters&nbsp; from the house.&nbsp; She also found bloodstains inside the house, the stains trailing from it to the place where the body of Bias lay on the ground.&nbsp; She also found that the two <span style="font-style: italic;">bayongs </span>and&nbsp; the sack, containing palay had disappeared and that only&nbsp; one half of the palay contents of the box&nbsp; remained.<br><br>The body of Bias was, examined by Dr. Zacarias Edades, municipal health officer, and&nbsp; he found on the body, six wounds, the most fatal&nbsp; of which was that in the neck. According to&nbsp; him, he must have been killed about 9:00 p.m. on November 28, but&nbsp; not earlier&nbsp; than 8:00&nbsp; p.m. There is no question that the crime of robbery with homicide was&nbsp; committed on&nbsp; November 28, 1954.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 1649 of the Court of First Instance of Albay, Isidro Valladolid, Dioscoro Reptin, Antonio&nbsp; Santonia, and Pedro Rubis were charged with robbery in band with homicide.&nbsp; After trial, they were all found guilty and were sentenced each to<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion perpetua</span>, with the accessories of the law, to indemnify&nbsp; the heirs of the deceased Bias, jointly and solidarily, in the sum of P6,000.00, and to pay the costs.&nbsp; All the&nbsp; accused, except Isidro Valladolid,. have brought&nbsp; the case&nbsp; to us on appeal.<br><br>We have scrutinized the record, particularly the extra-judicial statement made by&nbsp; the appellants and ratified before&nbsp; the&nbsp; Justice of the Peace of Libon, as well as the testimony of the witnesses and we agree with&nbsp; the&nbsp; trial court that&nbsp; the appellants'&nbsp; guilt has been established beyond reasonable&nbsp; doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge&nbsp; Mateo&nbsp; L. Alcasid in his well considered decision, on the&nbsp; basis&nbsp; of the evidence, has made a detailed and correct statement of&nbsp; the facts of the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; We reproduce with favor the&nbsp; pertinent portion of said decision:<br><blockquote>"On November 27, 1954, Hilario Olivares, a member of the rural council of&nbsp; barrio&nbsp; Santo Nino, Libon, Albay, a barrio adjacent to San Antonio,&nbsp; received&nbsp; a complaint from&nbsp; one Andres Mendevil to the&nbsp; effect&nbsp; that he found in&nbsp; the&nbsp; possession of the&nbsp; accused Isidro Valladolid&nbsp; the&nbsp; sack which was&nbsp; the container&nbsp; of a certain amount of palay stolen from him some time ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a resident of the barrio of Santo Ni√±o, Isidro&nbsp; Valladolid was&nbsp; sent for by&nbsp; the rural councilor, and when he&nbsp; came to the house of Hilario Olivares the councilor inquired from him if it was true that he&nbsp; took two cans of 'dinorado' palay from&nbsp; Andres Mendevil. Isidro Valladolid admitted that he did, where-upon, Olivares advised&nbsp; Valladolid to settle the matter with Mendevil by returning the two&nbsp; cans of 'dinorado' palay. Valladolid replied that he be given time until the next day, November 29, within&nbsp; which to procure the necessary&nbsp; palay with which to pay Mendevil and promised&nbsp; to return&nbsp; in the morning of said date to deliver the palay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Morning of the 29th came and he complied with his promise bringing with him&nbsp; the necessary&nbsp; amount of 'dinorado' palay&nbsp; to be paid to Mendevil.&nbsp; The councilor&nbsp; inquired from&nbsp; Valladolid as to where he&nbsp; got the palay and the latter replied that he got&nbsp; it from Januario&nbsp; Renganate,&nbsp; a resident of barrio San Ramon, also of Libon.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Wednesday, December&nbsp; 1st, the rural councilor learned of&nbsp; the robbery and killing that occurred in the house of Bias Buela&nbsp; and that some&nbsp; of the&nbsp; articles taken therefore were&nbsp; a sack and two buri bags containing 'dinorado' palay&nbsp; and in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; this report his&nbsp; suspicion was aroused that the 'dinorado' palay delivered to him by Valladolid might have&nbsp; been&nbsp; part of loot taken from the house&nbsp; of Bias Buela; so he sent for Valladolid again and told&nbsp; him to bring the original container of the palay which he claimed&nbsp; he got from Januario Renganate and with which he paid Mendevil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Valladolid himself fetched the container which turned out to be a buri bag. This buri bag was later identified by the widow of&nbsp; Bias Buela to be one&nbsp; of the buri bags containing 'dinorado' palay which disappeared from her house on the&nbsp; night of&nbsp; November 28.&nbsp; Further inquiries made&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; barrio&nbsp; councilor&nbsp; revealed that&nbsp; the&nbsp; 'dinorado' palay delivered to him by Valladolid did not&nbsp; come from&nbsp; Januario&nbsp; Renganate, for the&nbsp; latter denied giving any palay to Valladolid.&nbsp; Concluding from the circumstantial evidence he had on hand that Valladolid might have been responsible for the robbery and the killing of Bias Buela, the councilor had&nbsp; him arrested immediately and brought to the office of the Chief&nbsp; of Police in the poblacion of Libon for further investigation.<br><br>"The Chief of Police conducted the necessary investigation in the course of which&nbsp; Isidro Valladolid confessed to the robbery and the killing of&nbsp; Bias Buela and&nbsp; pointed&nbsp; and identified&nbsp; Dioscoro&nbsp; Reptin, Antonio&nbsp; Santonia and Pedro Rubis&nbsp; as his confederates in the commission of the crime.&nbsp; One by one these three persons were arrested and investigated and&nbsp; all the&nbsp; four accused formally&nbsp; signed&nbsp; written confessions which were&nbsp; presented during the&nbsp; trial and marked as Exhibits B, C, D, and&nbsp; E.&nbsp; These written&nbsp; confessions were signed by all the&nbsp; accused in front of the Justice of the Peace&nbsp; of Libon, Albay,&nbsp; who translated&nbsp; the contents thereof&nbsp; to&nbsp; them in&nbsp; the Bicol dialect&nbsp; and who even&nbsp; inserted therein&nbsp; in his own handwriting, certain corrections which the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; requested be made in&nbsp; their answer.&nbsp; When the four accused were arraigned before the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace&nbsp; Court&nbsp; during the&nbsp; second&nbsp; stage of the preliminary investigation&nbsp; they, assisted by&nbsp; their counsel, voluntarily&nbsp; pleaded guilty to the&nbsp; charge.<br><br>"The facts&nbsp; as&nbsp; above narrated were fully established beyond&nbsp; doubt by the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; presented by the prosecution&nbsp; during the&nbsp; trial."<br></blockquote>During the trial,&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused repudiated&nbsp; their&nbsp; sworn statements,&nbsp; wherein they&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; participation in the commission of the crime, claiming that the said statements were obtained through&nbsp; maltreatment&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; of Police.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also&nbsp; reproduce the pertinent&nbsp; portion&nbsp; of the appealed&nbsp; decision&nbsp; on&nbsp; this&nbsp; point:<br><blockquote>"There was also an attempt on the&nbsp; part of each&nbsp; of the&nbsp; accused to discredit the&nbsp; voluntary character of&nbsp; their signed confessions by alleging on the witness stand that they were maltreated&nbsp; by the Chief of Police of Libon, Albay, but the alleged maltreatment stands uncorroborated by any evidence except the verbal assertions of each of the&nbsp; accused.&nbsp; They did&nbsp; not complain to any authority,&nbsp; even&nbsp; to the Justice of the Peace before whom they signed the confessions, that they were maltreated,&nbsp; and their failure to complain as&nbsp; soon&nbsp; as possible against maltreatment alleged&nbsp; to&nbsp; have been&nbsp; inflicted&nbsp; upon them to procure their confessions indicates that there has been no such maltreatment&nbsp;&nbsp; (U.S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i>&nbsp; Castellon,&nbsp; 12&nbsp; Phil.,&nbsp; 160; U.S.&nbsp; <i>vs.</i> Barroga, 21 Phil., 161).&nbsp; Besides, the veracity of the "acts performed in the commission of the crime&nbsp; as&nbsp; described by the accused in the confessions is proven by the multiple wounds&nbsp; found&nbsp; on the&nbsp; body&nbsp; of Bias Buela.&nbsp; There were no witnesses&nbsp; to&nbsp; the killing and&nbsp; robbery other than, the accused themselves and the narration, of&nbsp; details&nbsp; in the commission thereof as contained in the confessions reveals, facts which could have been known only to the accused.&nbsp; All these show unmistakably that the confessions were&nbsp; voluntary.&nbsp; Not only that, the truth of the acts committed as admitted by the accused in their written&nbsp; concessions is&nbsp; further corroborated by the testimony&nbsp; of Cipriano Sallan, who, at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of November 28,&nbsp; 1954, saw the&nbsp; four&nbsp; accused on the barrio path near&nbsp; his house going in the direction of the house of Bias Buela, and about half an hour later, this witness&nbsp; again&nbsp; saw Isidro Valladolid and Dioscoro Reptin walking on the same path coming from the direction of the house of Blas Buela,&nbsp; the former carrying a buri bag with some contents on his shoulder, while the latter was carrying a sack, also with&nbsp; some contents, on his&nbsp; head."<br></blockquote>All the appellants interpose the defense of alibi and presented witnesses in corroboration.&nbsp; This defense&nbsp; had been fully analyzed by the trial court and found to be untenable. In this, the trial court was also correct.&nbsp; To show how far said witnesses were willing to go in order to support the defense of alibi of appellants, one witness testified that appellant Antonio Santonia was in his house on&nbsp; a certain date, whereas the record shows that on that date, Santonia had&nbsp; already&nbsp; been arrested&nbsp; and was in jail.<br><br>As we have already said, the record amply and fully establishes the guilt of&nbsp; the accused.&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from their sworn confessions admitting&nbsp; complicity&nbsp; in the commission of the crime, in the course of the investigation made by the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace,&nbsp; while assisted by counsel, they&nbsp; all pleaded guilty to the charge of robbery with homicide. Not only this, but on the night&nbsp; of the robbery, a witness for the prosecution&nbsp; saw&nbsp; the four&nbsp; accused,&nbsp; including&nbsp; the three appellants herein pass his house and walk along the path leading to the house&nbsp; of the deceased Bias.&nbsp; Some time later, he saw&nbsp; two of said accused returning from the direction of&nbsp; said house of Blas, one carrying a loaded <i>bayong</i> on his shoulder&nbsp; and the other carrying "a sack with contents on his head.&nbsp; This fact not only connects the accused with the commission&nbsp; of the crime, but does&nbsp; away&nbsp; with their defense of alibi and&nbsp; the&nbsp; claim that on the night&nbsp; of&nbsp; the robbery, they were nowhere near the vicinity of the house of&nbsp; Blas.<br><br>The Solicitor General in his well written brief&nbsp; claims that the commission of the crime was accompanied by two aggravating circumstances, namely, dwelling&nbsp; and&nbsp; nighttime, and&nbsp; he recommends&nbsp; that the&nbsp; penalty&nbsp; should be imposed in its&nbsp; maximum degree,&nbsp; namely,&nbsp; death.&nbsp; The claim and recommendation are not without merit.&nbsp; However, for lack of the necessary number of votes for&nbsp; the imposition&nbsp; of&nbsp; the death&nbsp; penalty, we&nbsp; affirm the decision of the trial court, with costs.<br><br><i> Paras, C.
