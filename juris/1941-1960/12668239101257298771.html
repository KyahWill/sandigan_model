				<BR><STRONG>BARRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> Florentino Joya is&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner&nbsp; of a parcel&nbsp; of land with an area of 11 hectares (lot No. 1171), situated in Sanja Mayor, Tanza, Cavite, which had been under lease to one Maximina Bondad for 16 years.&nbsp; For the&nbsp; duration&nbsp; of said&nbsp; period, the&nbsp; land was&nbsp; tenanted&nbsp; and worked&nbsp; on for the lessee by Pedro Pareja.<br><br>In April, 1954, upon termination&nbsp; of the lease agreement, the&nbsp; property&nbsp; was returned to&nbsp; the landowner,&nbsp; with the lessee recommending&nbsp; that the&nbsp; same&nbsp; be leased to&nbsp; Pareja. The said&nbsp; tenant and the landowner, however, failed&nbsp; to agree on the terms under&nbsp; which the former could&nbsp; work on the land, specifically on the matter of rental, as Joya demanded 120 cavanes&nbsp; as&nbsp; annual rental therefor.&nbsp; Notwithstanding such lack of understanding&nbsp; between them, Pareja continued on his cultivation of the&nbsp; property. <br><br>On May 24, 1954, the tenant filed with the Court of Industrial Relations (before the creation of the Court of Agrarian&nbsp; Relations) Tenancy Case "No. 5281-R against Florentino Joya&nbsp; for the&nbsp; purpose of&nbsp; securing a reduction of the rental allegedly&nbsp; being imposed upon him by the respondent.&nbsp; The landowner&nbsp; resisted the&nbsp; complaint disclaiming that Pareja had ever been his tenant. <br><br>Two days thereafter&nbsp; or&nbsp; on May&nbsp; 26,&nbsp; Florentino&nbsp; Joya leased the land to Domingo&nbsp; Joya at an annual rent of 120 cavanes.&nbsp; As the aforesaid lessee&nbsp; found Pareja already working on the land, the former agreed to allow him (Pareja) to continue with his cultivation on condition that they would equally share its produce after deducting the rental for the land.&nbsp; In view of this development, Pareja moved for the dismissal of his&nbsp; complaint against the landowner, then&nbsp; pending in the Court of Industrial Relations, on the ground that the&nbsp; parties therein&nbsp; had&nbsp; already reached an agreement on the matter in controversy. <br><br>One year later, or on April 10,&nbsp; 1955, Florentino&nbsp; Joya renewed the lease in favor of Domingo Joya but included as co-lessee one Juan Tahimic.&nbsp; The&nbsp; rent was. reduced to 105&nbsp; cavanes a year.&nbsp; Pareja, with whom&nbsp; Domingo had worked during the previous&nbsp; year, refused to surrender the land&nbsp; to&nbsp; Tahimic.&nbsp; Thereupon, Florentino filed with the Justice of the Peace Court&nbsp; of Tanza, Cavite, a complaint for&nbsp; usurpation against&nbsp; Pareja&nbsp; who, consequently,&nbsp; was arrested and stayed in jail&nbsp; for a&nbsp; week.&nbsp; When finally released on bail,&nbsp; Pareja filed a&nbsp; counter-charge with the Office of the Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal, against Florentino&nbsp; Joya, Juan Tahimic, and Domingo Joya, for alleged violation of Republic Act 1199. <br><br>However, threatened to be imprisoned again or fined in the usurpation case if he did not desist and surrender the land, he withdrew his complaint manifesting that he was surrendering the property to its owner but&nbsp; "leaving to the Court of Industrial Relations or Agrarian Court the determination of whatever right he may have in the said land."&nbsp; Thereafter, at the instance of Florentino Joya, the criminal case&nbsp; for usurpation was also dismissed.<br><br>On January 31, 1956,&nbsp; Pareja&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the Court of Agrarian Relations a complaint against Florentino Joya and Juan Tahimic for alleged violation of Republic Act&nbsp; 1199 (Tenancy Case&nbsp; No. CAR-6, Cavite),&nbsp; consisting of his allegedly unlawful ejectment from the land he was working on for 16 years and the appointment by Florentino Joya of his co-defendant Juan Tahimic as tenant&nbsp; in&nbsp; his&nbsp; (Pareja's) stead; of the landowner's filing&nbsp; a criminal action when he refused to vacate the property and making it a condition for its dismissal his (Pareja's) surrender of the same.&nbsp; And contending&nbsp; that&nbsp; he unwillingly&nbsp; vacated the land for fear of&nbsp; being&nbsp; again&nbsp; indicted&nbsp; in court, Pareja prayed for his reinstatement to&nbsp; the landholding; payment to him of his&nbsp; share of the crops for the agricultural year 1955-56&nbsp; which&nbsp; he failed to receive; for damages&nbsp; and attorney's fees. In their answer with counterclaim, defendants Florentino and&nbsp; Juan&nbsp; denied the existence of&nbsp; tenancy&nbsp; relationship between plaintiff arid defendant Florentino; and claimed that the complaint stated no cause of action and that the case had already been passed upon by competent authorities (apparently referring to the dismissal&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Court of Industrial Relations and the Provincial&nbsp; Fiscal's&nbsp; Office of the previous complaints of Pareja against the same defendants) .&nbsp; Domingo Joya also filed an answer in intervention praying for the recognition of his and Tahimic's superior right to work on and&nbsp; cultivate&nbsp; the&nbsp; land. <br><br>After due hearing, the Court rendered judgment holding that upon termination of the civil lease in favor of Maximina Bondad, Pedro Pareja, the lessee's tenant, automatically became&nbsp; the&nbsp; tenant of the landowner,&nbsp; pursuant to Section 26—4 of Act 4054; that said tenant, on the other hand, in agreeing to share equally with Domingo Joya the produce of the land for the agricultural&nbsp; year 1954-55 in effect waived his&nbsp; right&nbsp; over an undetermined ½&nbsp; of the landholding; that the subsequent contract of lease entered into between the landowner and Domingo Joya and Juan Tahimic as lessees could not prejudice the right of, Pareja to work on the&nbsp; same land and, accordingly, was declared valid only insofar as that portion given&nbsp; up by the latter in favor of Domingo Joya was concerned.&nbsp; Consequently, Pedro Pareja was ordered reinstated to ½ of the 11 hectare landholding, while Domingo Joya and Juan Tahimic were recognized as joint tenants over the other half.&nbsp; As the rental for the&nbsp; lease of the land was fixed at 53.75 cavanes per agricultural year after taking into consideration its nature and productivity, the court also directed Florentino Joya&nbsp; to&nbsp; return to plaintiff Pareja&nbsp; and intervenor Domingo Joya 21.25 cavanes of palay or their value, which were overpaid to him (the landowner) for the agricultural year 1954-55; and to Domingo Joya&nbsp; and&nbsp; Juan Tahimc 55 cavanes or their corresponding value&nbsp; which were overpaid to him for the&nbsp; years&nbsp; 1955-56&nbsp; and&nbsp; 1956-57.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court, however, finding that plaintiff's failure to continue on the cultivation of the land and its return to the owner could not be imputed to the&nbsp; latter, exonerated&nbsp; Florentino Joya from the charge of violation of Republic Act 1199.&nbsp; Not satisfied with this decision, therein defendants and intervenor filed this petition for review. <br><br>Admittedly, the respondent-tenant cultivated the land for the lessee for 16 years or for&nbsp; the entire duration of the lease agreement. There is no&nbsp; controversy either that tenancy relationship existed&nbsp; between Maximina Bondad, the lessee, and Pareja, the tenant.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>The question now interposed in this petition is&nbsp; whether&nbsp; the tenant of&nbsp; a lessee retains the right to work&nbsp; on the land despite the termination of the lease, or said in other words, whether his being a tenant of the lessee makes&nbsp; him,&nbsp; upon the expiration of the contract, a tenant of the lessor. The question&nbsp; thus presented&nbsp; must&nbsp; be answered in the affirmative, not so&nbsp; much&nbsp; because of Act 4054 relied&nbsp; upon by the Agrarian Court, but pursuant to Section 9 of Republic Act 1199, as amended by Section 3 of Republic Act 2263, which reads&nbsp; in part: <br><blockquote>"SEC.&nbsp; 9. <span style="font-style: italic;">Severance&nbsp; of Relations.</span>—The&nbsp; tenancy relationship&nbsp; is extinguished by the voluntary surrender or abandonment of the land by, or the death or incapacity of, the&nbsp; tenant: <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <br></div>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The expiration of the&nbsp; period of the contract as fixed by the parties, or the sale, alienation or transfer of legal possession of the land does not of itself extinguish&nbsp; the relationship.&nbsp; In the latter&nbsp; ease, the purchaser or transferee&nbsp; shall&nbsp; assume the rights and obligations of the former landholder in relation to the tenant&nbsp; In case of&nbsp; death of the landholder, his&nbsp; heir or heirs shall likewise assume his rights and&nbsp; obligations."&nbsp; (Italics supplied.) <br></blockquote>&nbsp;It is clear from the foregoing that tenancy relationship is not extinguished by (1) the expiration of the contract (of tenancy); (2) sale; (3) alienation; or (4) transfer of legal possession of the land.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;In a contract of lease, the lessee, for the duration of the contract, acquires legal possession and control of the property subject of the agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; The return by&nbsp; the lessee of the property to the lessor, upon&nbsp; expiration of the lease contract, naturally involves again a transfer of possession from one lawful holder to another.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it may be asked, is this transfer of possession included in or comprehended by the aforequoted Section 9&nbsp; of&nbsp; Republic&nbsp; Act 1199, as amended? <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Prior to the enactment of Republic Act&nbsp; 2263,&nbsp; amending Republic Act 1199, our tenancy legislations, while providing for the tenant's right in cases of sale or alienation of the property, is silent where there is only a transfer of legal possession of the land.&nbsp; With the amendment of the Agricultural Tenancy&nbsp; Act (Rep. Act 1199)&nbsp; on June 19, 1959, the tenure&nbsp; of the&nbsp; tenant in the land he is cultivating was secured even in cases of transfer of legal possession.&nbsp; Petitioner-landowner,&nbsp; however, claims that to&nbsp; hold that the lessee's tenant, with whom&nbsp; he had no dealing whatsoever, automatically becomes his tenant&nbsp; upon the return&nbsp; of the property to him would&nbsp; constitute a restraint on his right to enter into contract and deprive him of his liberty (to contract) and property without due process of law. <br><br>This same contention was raised during the deliberations of the then Senate Bill No. 119, but Congress,&nbsp; decided to implement its policy and objective in adopting the Agricultural Tenancy Law and passed the bill in its present form. The following is&nbsp; quoted from the&nbsp; Congressional&nbsp; Record:<br><blockquote>"SENATOR PRIMICIAS.&nbsp; On the severance of relationship of tenant and landowner, it seems that there is an intention&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; part of Your&nbsp; Honor&nbsp; to amend Section 9 of the&nbsp; Act sq as to include the transfer of legal possession of land in one or two cases which do not extinguish the relationship ***.<br><br>"SENATOR PELAEZ.&nbsp; I would say that this&nbsp; afternoon, in the&nbsp; Committee on Revision&nbsp; of&nbsp; Laws, we were1&nbsp; considering&nbsp; amendments to the effect that the present tenants must have the priority right, and I think we should give priority to those&nbsp; tenants who are there and that any transfer of lands should not&nbsp; affect them&nbsp; the least.<br><br>"SENATOR&nbsp; PRIMICIAS. * * *.&nbsp; Does&nbsp; Your&nbsp; Honor&nbsp; think that the landowner is&nbsp; not entitled to transfer the lease to another person even if the price offered is better? <br><br>"SENATOR PELAEZ.&nbsp; Under the present law, he cannot do it. <br><br>"SENATOR PRIMICIAS.&nbsp; Would that not&nbsp; constitute a deprivation of property without due process of law.<br><br>"SENATOR PELAEZ.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is deprivation of property without due process of law.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in the present law.&nbsp;&nbsp; But we have to remember here social values and human values against material values.&nbsp; Precisely, the agricultural tenancy act remedied&nbsp; an existing evil because before the agricultural tenancy act provided for security&nbsp; of&nbsp; these poor tenants, they were pushed out of the land&nbsp; by the landlords. *** ." (Senate&nbsp; Congressional Record,&nbsp; Vol. I,&nbsp; No. 54, April&nbsp; 21, 1958,&nbsp; p. 905-906.)<br></blockquote>It is our considered judgment, since the return by the lessee&nbsp; of the leased property to the lessor upon the expiration of the contract&nbsp; involves also a transfer of legal possession, and taking into account the manifest intent of the lawmaking body in amending the law, i.e.,&nbsp; to provide the tenant with security of tenure in all&nbsp; cases&nbsp; of transfer of legal possession,&nbsp; that the&nbsp; instant case&nbsp; falls within&nbsp; and is governed by the&nbsp; provisions of Section&nbsp; 9&nbsp; of Republic Act 1199,&nbsp; as amended by Republic Act 2263.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The termination of the lease, therefore, did not divest the tenant of the right to remain and&nbsp; continue on his cultivation of the land.&nbsp; Furthermore, should&nbsp; any&nbsp; doubt exist as&nbsp; to&nbsp; the applicability of the aforementioned provision of law to the case at bar such doubt&nbsp; must be resolved in favor of the tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <br><br>Petitioner landowner likewise&nbsp; assails the legality of the judgment&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; court&nbsp; <i>a quo</i> prescribing the&nbsp; rental that must&nbsp; be paid&nbsp; by the tenants, it being claimed that such question was&nbsp; never&nbsp; raised&nbsp; in the pleadings filed&nbsp; in said court.&nbsp; This&nbsp; is not&nbsp; exactly the&nbsp; case,. because&nbsp; it must be remembered that the main&nbsp; reason for the&nbsp; refusal of the landowner to&nbsp; let&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; continue&nbsp; in the cultivation of the landholding in 1954&nbsp; was precisely the question of the rental to be paid, the tenant claiming that the 120&nbsp; cavanes being asked by the landowner was excessive.&nbsp; This, therefore, is a matter of&nbsp; dispute between the parties and the action taken by the&nbsp; Agrarian Court is sanctioned&nbsp; by Section 11 of Republic&nbsp; Act No. 1267 which provides: <br><blockquote>SEC.&nbsp; 11. <i>Character of Order or Decision</i>.—In issuing an&nbsp; order or decision, the Court shall not be restricted to the specific relief claimed or demands made by the parties to the dispute, but may include in the order or decision any matter or determination which may be deemed necessary and expedient for the purpose of settling the dispute or&nbsp; of preventing further disputes, provided that said matter for determination has been established by competent evidence during the hearing.<br></blockquote>Contrary to petitioners' contention that no proof was adduced during the trial to support the lower court's finding that&nbsp; the&nbsp; entire&nbsp; landholding has an average annual yield of 215&nbsp; cavanes,&nbsp; we have the testimony of Florentino Joya himself that&nbsp; "the land normally produces more&nbsp; than 300 cavanes per&nbsp; year" (pp.&nbsp; 207 &amp; 225, Records).&nbsp; There&nbsp; is also the statement of Pareja that in 1954-55, he harvested 133 cavanes, in spite of poor crop.&nbsp; (p. 45, Record.)&nbsp; Hence, we find no reason to disturb&nbsp; the finding of fact of the lower court.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Petitioners also allege that the&nbsp; tenant voluntarily&nbsp; surrendered&nbsp; the property to the&nbsp; landowner,&nbsp; as&nbsp; evidenced by an affidavit executed&nbsp; by Pareja on July i6, 1955 and subscribed before the Justice of the&nbsp; Peace of Tanza, Cavite, the translation of which reads: <br><blockquote>"I, PEDRO PAREJA, of legal age, and residing in the municipality of Tanza, Cavite,&nbsp; under oath, state the following: <br><br>"That in accordance with what I have declared before the Provincial Fiscal of Cavite during the investigation (July 6, 1955), I will not interfere with or continue&nbsp; the&nbsp; cultivation in the land of Mr. Florentino&nbsp; Joya in Balite, Tanza, Cavite, Lot No. 1171,&nbsp; and which I am voluntarily returning&nbsp; to him, nevertheless I am&nbsp; leaving&nbsp; to the C.I.R.&nbsp; or Agrarian Court the&nbsp; determination of&nbsp; whatever right I may have in&nbsp; said land. <br><br>"IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I&nbsp; hereby sign&nbsp; this&nbsp; document, in the&nbsp; Municipal building of Tanza, Cavite, this 16th day of July, 1955. <br><br>(Sgd.)&nbsp; PEDRO PAREJA"<br></blockquote>This&nbsp; statement notwithstanding, the&nbsp; lower court found that "petitioner's fear—after his incarceration was ordered by the&nbsp; Justice of the Peace—was such that his freedom of choice was impaired, or at least restricted.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, he was not&nbsp; acting voluntarily."&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>This conclusion is&nbsp; fully supported by the record of the case.&nbsp; The explanation&nbsp; of the&nbsp; tenant is sufficiently borne out by the circumstances attending the execution&nbsp; of the document.&nbsp; At the time he made the statement both in the office of the Provincial Fiscal and the Justice of the Peace of Tanza&nbsp; (who ordered his previous arrest), petitioner Florentino Joya was in attendance.&nbsp; The criminal action filed by Florentino&nbsp; against him was then pending in the justice of the peace court.&nbsp; The fact that immediately after the execution of the affidavit the landowner moved for the dismissal of the aforementioned criminal case corroborates Pareja's testimony that he had&nbsp; to do as he did out of fear of further harassment. <br><br>Significantly too, it&nbsp; may be&nbsp; observed from&nbsp; a reading of&nbsp; the&nbsp; document&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; affiant&nbsp; did not turn over the property to the owner unconditionally.&nbsp; On the contrary, he&nbsp; made a reservation of&nbsp; his right to secure from the proper&nbsp; court a judicial declaration of whatever interest he&nbsp; may have&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; land.&nbsp; This&nbsp; indeed&nbsp; contradicts the supposed "voluntariness" of the tenant's&nbsp; act in giving up the land.<br><br>With respect to the&nbsp; charge that a portion of the land was utilized by the tenant as a&nbsp; "tilapia" fish pondt&nbsp; we agree with the lower court that there is&nbsp; no evidence that it resulted in Material injury to the land (Sec. 51, Rep. Act 1199).&nbsp; The uncontradicted testimony is that the fishpond was made on requirement&nbsp; of the Bureau of Agricultural Extension that every&nbsp; farmer in the vicinity should have a small fishpond, and that this&nbsp; particular fishpond was on the&nbsp; portion&nbsp; ("balot")&nbsp; not used&nbsp; for planting rice (pp. 81-82,&nbsp; Record.)<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; finding no&nbsp; reason&nbsp; to review the&nbsp; decision appealed from, the same&nbsp; is&nbsp; hereby affirmed, with costs against petitioner Florentino Joya.&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Paras C.
