				G.R. No. L-2722, December 15, 1949</h4>
				<H3>NICOLAS LIZARES & CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. BIENVENIDO TAN, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL CITY, MARY HAYDEN ARCACHE, ASSISTED BY HER HUSBAND, JOSEPH ARCACHE, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BENGZON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Nicolas Lizares &amp; Co., Inc., a corporation duly organized, 
asks that respondent judge be enjoined from taking cognizance of a motion filed 
by the other respondents in G.L.R.O. Record No. 320 of the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal. The facts are these:
<ol><li>On May 10, 1944, Nicolas Lizares &amp; Co., Inc. sold two lots in Pasay, 
Rizal, to the respondents Jose Arcache and Mary Hayden de Arcache for the total 
sum of P621,500, of which P150,000 was paid on March 10, 1944. It was agreed 
that the remainder of the price would be delivered in two installments: P200,000 
within ninety days, beginning April 3, 1944, and P271,000 within twelve months 
from April 3, 1944. To guarantee payment of these installments a first mortgage 
was created on the two lots. The document of sale with mortgage is known in the 
record as Exhibit A;<br><br>
</li><li>The first installment of P200,000 was duly paid, as per receipt Exhibit D, 
dated August 6, 1944;<br><br>
</li><li>On June 30, 1948, the Arcache spouses filed in the Court of First Instance 
of Rizal in G.L.R.O. Record No. 320, a motion alleging the execution of the 
document of sale and mortgage Exhibit A, and the total payment of the amounts 
due thereunder, and they requested that the Register of Deeds of Rizal be 
ordered to cancel the transfer certificate of title No. 72435, and to issue a 
new title in the name of the purchasers—herein respondents—discharging at the 
same time the mortgage evidenced by the same Exhibit A;<br><br>
</li><li>By order of July 3, 1948, the respondent judge granted the motion; but on 
December 2, 1948, he revoked that order upon petition of Nicolas Lizares &amp; 
Company, who alleged it had not been previously advised of the petition. The 
judge then directed that the motion be again heard on December 18, 1948;<br><br>
</li><li>Nicolas Lizares &amp; Co. thereafter objected in writing to the jurisdiction 
of the respondent, arguing that as judge acting on a petition filed in a land 
registration <em>expediente</em> he had no jurisdiction to pass upon the reality 
and validity of the payment allegedly made of the last installment of P271,000 
which the said corporation denied and traversed;<br><br>
</li><li>The respondent judge overruled the opposition and announced his intention to 
dispose of the motion;<br><br>
</li><li>Hence the petitioner immediately filed this petition for prohibition, and 
obtained a preliminary injunction. </li></ol>
<p align="justify">It is at once apparent from the pleadings that the main 
contention of the petitioner corporation, is that the respondent judge may not, 
in the <em>expediente</em> of the cadastral proceedings, pass upon the question 
it expressly raised, namely: whether the last installment of P271,000 had been 
duly paid. It seems that respondents Arcache claim payment by virtue of a 
deposit of P271,000 supposedly made by them in the Philippine National Bank on 
January 8, 1945, in the name of "Nicolas Lizares"—not Nicolas Lizares &amp; 
Company, Inc. The petitioning corporation maintains on the other hand that such 
deposit was no valid payment and did not operate to discharge the obligation to 
satisfy the second installment of the purchase price, and therefore did not have 
the effect of cancelling the mortgage.</p>
<p align="justify">In Castillo vs. Ramos, L-1031 (45 Off. Gaz., 183),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the owners of registered land asked the 
Tayabas court that the mortgage in favor of the Agricultural Bank recorded on 
their certificate of title be cancelled inasmuch as the debt had been paid 
during the last war. The petition was filed in the original <em>expediente</em> 
of registration of the land. The Bank opposed the petition; and the judge denied 
it on the ground that he had no power to grant within that registration case the 
petitioner's motion, inasmuch as the question should be the subject of an 
ordinary action to compel execution of a release of mortgage. In a petition for 
mandamus here, we upheld the judge's view saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We are of opinion that the lower court was right. Such a 
transcedental question as whether payment during the war with Japanese military 
notes of a pre-war obligation in Philippine genuine money is valid or not, is 
clearly beyond the special and limited jurisdiction of a Court of First Instance 
acting as a Court of Land Registration under our laws. The special and limited 
character of this jurisdiction is apparent from the provision of section 2 of 
Act No. 496, as amended, as well as those of the Cadastral Act (No. 
2259)."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And then after quoting the case of Bank of the Philippine 
Islands vs. Ty Cameo Sobrino (57 Phil., 801), we explained that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"If the question of the validity of the above-mentioned second 
mortgage was not within the purview of the jurisdiction of the Court of First 
Instance acting as a Court of Land Registration, for similar reasons, if not 
stronger ones, the question of the validity of the payment with Japanese 
military notes during the war of the pre-war mortgage indebtedness in Philippine 
genuine money herein involved, should be held, as we hold it, to be without the 
special and limited jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance acting as a 
Court of Land Registration.</p>
<p align="center">"x x x x x x x x "<br></p><p align="justify">"If there is such a clear separation and distinction between 
land registration proceedings and ordinary civil actions, what properly pertains 
to the general jurisdiction of the courts in ordinary civil actions should not 
be brought to them as courts of land registration with the limited and special 
jurisdiction characteristic of such courts."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In this proceeding the issue raised by the Nicolas Lizares 
&amp; Co., Inc., like the question of the validity or cancellation or discharge 
of a mortgage in the above two decisions, properly pertains to an ordinary civil 
action and should not fall within the limited jurisdiction of a court of first 
instance acting as a court of land registration.</p>
<p align="justify">There is another point. The certificate of title No. 72435 
which the Arcaches desire to cancel is apparently in the names of Lidia L. 
Lizares and Ofelia L. Lizares. It does not appear that these ladies have been 
notified or that they joined issue in the cadastral <em>expediente</em>.</p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the petition for prohibition is granted and the 
injunction heretofore issued is made permanent.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner has filed a supplementary petition alleging that 
in compliance with the order of the respondent judge, dated July 3, 1948 (which 
was subsequently revoked), the register of deeds of Rizal, Ricardo P. Tensuan, 
cancelled transfer certificate of title No. 72435 and issued, T. C. T. No. 689 
in the name of the respondent spouses that a proper petition was submitted to 
the respondent judge to require the register of deeds to cancel the new 
certificate and reinstate the old one; that the respondent judge declined to act 
on said petition in view of the preliminary injunction issued by this Supreme 
Court. Petitioner consequently requests for appropriate orders against the 
register of deeds, who is impleaded as additional party respondent.</p>
<p align="justify">Considering what we have explained, it will be apparent that 
the new certificate No. 689 in the name of the respondent spouses was invalidly 
issued, as the cancellation of transfer certificate of title No. 72435 was 
erroneously done. Hence the respondent register of deeds is directed to cancel 
the above-mentioned certificate of title No. 689 and to reissue transfer 
certificate of title No. 72435. This is, of course, without prejudice to the 
decision that may be subsequently promulgated in another suit, if any, between 
the respondent spouses and Nicolas Lizares &amp; Co., Inc.</p>
