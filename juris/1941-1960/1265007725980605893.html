				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. GO PIN, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Go Pin, an alien and a Chinese citizen, was charged with a violation of 
Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code for having exhibited in the City of Manila 
at the Globe Arcade, a recreation center, a large number of one-real 
16-millimeter films about 100 feet in length each, which are allegedly indecent 
and/or immoral. At first, he pleaded not guilty of the information but later as 
allowed by the court to change his plea to that of guilty which he did. Not 
content with the plea of guilty the trial court had the films in question 
projected and were viewed by it in order to evaluate the same from the 
standpoint of decency and morality. Thereafter, and considering the plea of 
guilty entered by the accused, and the fact thaf after viewing the films the 
trial court noted only a slight degree of obscenity, indecency and immorality in 
them, it sentenced the appellant to 6 months and 1 day of <em>prision 
correcional</em> and to pay a fine of P300, with subsidiary imprisonment in case 
of insolvency, and to pay the costs. He is now appealing from the decision. 
<p>Go Pin does not deny his guilt but he claims that under the circumstances 
surrounding the case, particularly the slight degree of obscenity, indecency and 
immorality noted by the court in the films, the prison sentence should be 
eliminated from the penalty imposed. His counsel brings to our, attention some 
authorities to the effect that paintings and pictures of women in the nude, 
including sculptures of that kind are not offensive because they are made and 
presented for the sake of art. We agree with counsel for appellant in part. If 
such pictures, sculptures and paintings are shown in art exhibits and art 
galleries for the cause of art, to be viewed and appreciated by people 
interested in art, there would be no offense committed. However, the pictures 
here in question were used not exactly for art's sake but rather for commercial 
purposes. In other words, the supposed artistic qualities of said pictures were 
being commercialized so that the cause of art was of secondary or minor 
importance. Gain and profit would appear to have been the main, if not the 
exclusive consideration in their exhibition; and it would not be, surprising if 
the persons who went to see those pictures and paid entrance fees for the 
privilege of doing so, were not exactly artists and persons interested in art 
and who generally go to art exhibitions and galleries to satisfy and improve 
their artistic tastes, but rather people desirous of satisfying their morbid 
curiosity and taste, and lust, and for love for excitement, including the youth 
who because of their immaturity are not in a position to resist and shield 
themselves from the ill and perverting effects of these pictures.</p>
<p>Before rendering sentence the trial court asked the prosecuting attorney for 
this recommendation and said official recommended that "considering that the 
accused Go Pin is an alien who is supposed to maintain a high degree of morality 
while he is in the Philippines", and "considering that he engaged in a very 
nefarious trade, which degenerates the moral character of our youth, who are 
usually the regular customers of his trade", he recommended that appellant be 
sentenced to 2 years imprisonment and a fine of P300. Notwithstanding this 
recommendation, the trial court as already said, probably considering its 
opinion that the pictures were not so obscence, indecent and immoral but only 
slightly so, gave appellant only 6 months and 1 day of <em>prision 
correcional</em> in addition to P300 fine.</p>
<p>The penalty imposed by the trial court is within the range provided by 
Article 201 of the Revised Code. We are satisfied that in imposing the penalty 
the trial court made use of its sound discretion, and we find no reason for 
modifying the said sentence. The Solicitor General in his brief even urges that 
we recommend to the proper authorities that deportation proceedings be 
instituted against appellant as an undesirable alien. The trial court could have 
done this but did not do so, believing perhaps that it was warranted. We repeat 
that we do not feel justified in interfering with the discretion of the trial 
court in the imposition of the sentence in this case.</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with 
costs.</p>
<p><em>Bengzon, Acting C. J., Padilla, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista Angelo, 
Labrador, Concepcion</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p>
<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p></div>
