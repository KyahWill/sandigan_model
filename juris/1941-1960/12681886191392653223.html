				<BR><STRONG>CONCEPCION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal, taken by defendants Dalisay Santos and the Director of 
Lands, from a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, in favor of 
Crisanto Grande and Domingo Josef, plaintiffs in civil cases Nos, 1656 and 1657, 
respectively, of said courts which were jointly tried and decided therein, as 
well as jointly brought for review before us.
<p>The pertinent facts are: Defendant Dalisay Santos, single" is an employee in 
a local bank. Prior, and subsequently, to the purchase of the Tambobong Estate 
by the Government, in December, 1947, and even before 1938, lot 12, of block No. 
48, of said estate, with an area of 144 square meters, more or less, was leased 
to her. In 1938 she sublet a portion, of about 57 square meters, on the eastern 
part of lot 12, to plaintiff Domingo Josef, at a monthly rental of P1.00. In 
1939, a portion of about 47 square meters, located on the western part of said 
lot, was sublet by her, at the same rental of P1 a month, to plaintiff Crisanto 
Grande. The latter, as well as Domingo Josef, constructed their houses on their 
respective portions, which they occupy up, to the present. According to the 
stipulation of facts between the parties, Dalisay Santos lives with her parents, 
in a house built on lot 12, presumably in the portion thereof not covered by the 
contracts of sublease with plaintiffs herein. Upon application filed by her in 
1948, and after due investigation conducted by the Rural Progress 
Administration—owing to the oppositions interposed by Crisanto Grande and 
Domingo Josef, who, likewise, sought to purchase the portions respectively held 
by them—said lot was, in 1949, awarded,, by the Government, to Dalisay Santos, 
in whose favor Transfer Certificate of Title No, 18315 was issued on June 28, 
1950. On February 25, 1952, Grande and Josef instituted, respectively, said 
cases Nos. 1656 and 1657 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, for the 
purpose of securing a judgment (1) annulling the sale by the Government, in 
favor of Dalisay Santos, (2) compelling the Director of Lands to approve 
plaintiff's application to purchase the portions possessed by each, and (3). 
directing Dalisay Santos to convey said portions to them, upon the theory that, 
as actual occupants, plaintiffs allegedly have a better right, than Dalisay 
Santos, to purchase said portions of lot 12.</p>
<p>Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 539, pursuant to which the Tambobong Estate 
was purchased and is being disposed of, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The President of the. Philippines is authorized to acquire lands or any 
interest therein, through purchase or expropriation, and to subdivide the same 
into home lots or small farms for resale at reasonable prices and under such 
conditions as he may fix to their <em>bona fide</em> tenants or occupants or to 
private individuals who will work the land themselves and who are qualified "to 
acquire and own lands in the Philippines."</p></blockquote>
<p>Do plaintiffs and appellees have a preferential right to acquire the 
aforementioned portions of lot 12? Plaintiffs-appellees contend that the answer 
should be in the affirmative and the lower court sustained this view, upon the 
following ground:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While there is no question that the sale of the property made by the 
Director of Lands, as representative of the Government in favor of Dalisay 
Santos has the semblance of validity, legally ¦speaking, yet to enforce said 
contract of sale would be tantamount to destroying completely the main objective 
of the Government for investing millions of pesos in the purchase of the, 
Tambobong Estate and to thwart and defeat the intent of the legislature. As 
above stated, the purchase of this Tambobong Estate is, as well stated by His 
Excellency the President of the Philippines, for the purpose of granting; and 
selling small lots to the landless specially to those who are in actual physical 
possession of said lots and who have constructed their small houses on the said 
land. But the Director of the Bureau of Lands, oblivious of this benevolent 
intention of the Government, instead of selling the property in small lots to 
the actual occupants or to persons who have the actual physical possession of 
said lots for years previous to its acquisition by the Government, began as in 
these two cases to sell big parcels of land to certain privileged individuals, 
knowing positively that more of these purchasers are absentee owners with the 
exception of a few cases where they occupy only a small portion of the lands 
which they purchased, while the greater portions of said lands are occupied by 
sub-Jessees and sub-tenants, as in the instant cases. By this process the, 
Tambobong Estate, instead of being sold to its actual occupants and instead of 
giving land to the landless, thereby affording peace and security to the 
sub-lessees and actual tenants of the land, it vests the right of ownership to 
those who, by reason of their financial ability, could purchase more than what 
they actually need for their personal use in order to sublet later on the 
property which they purchased from the defendant Director of Lands to others" 
(Record on Appeal, pp. 81-82.)</p></blockquote>
<p>The cases at bar do not fall, however, within the purview of the evil pointed 
out in the decision appealed from. Indeed, lot 12 is not a "big" parcel of land, 
its area being merely 144 square meters. Again, pursuant to the stipulation of 
facts, Dalisay Santos is, not an absentee owner, but an actual occupant of part 
of said lot. Plaintiffs-appellees state in their brief that said stipulation is 
inaccurate, for Dalisay Santos, allegedly, lives in the house of her parents, in 
the <em>adjoining</em> lot 11, which appears to have been leased to her brother. 
Obviously, this mere assertion cannot prevail over the stipulation of facts, the 
accuracy of which was not contested in the lower court. At any rate, even if 
said assertion were true, Dalisay Santos could not be regarded as an absentee 
owner, for, according to appellees' own pretense, she lives in the house of her 
parents <em>in lot 11</em>, which <em>adjoins</em> the one in question. It 
should be noted, also, that, by reason of her sex and civil status, as well as 
of our customs and traditions, she has no choice but to stay, for the time 
being, with her parents.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is absolutely nothing in the record :to show that Dalisay 
Santos is in a position to purchase, or had purchased, from the Government "more 
than what she actually needs for her personal use." On the contrary, it appears 
that she is merely an employee in a local bank and that the area of the lot in 
dispute, is barely sufficient to meet her needs. We must bear in mind that, 
sooner or later, Dalisay Santos shall form a separate and distinct family of her 
own, for which lot 12 will be necessary.</p>
<p>Both parties have argued extensively on the question as to who enjoys 
priority in the purchase of lands under section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 539. 
On the one hand, plaintiffs-appellees contend that bona fide occupants have a 
better right than bona fide tenants, in the light of the historical background 
of said legislation, which, it is claimedj was prompted by the policy to favor 
actual occupants; Upon the other hand, defendants-appellants maintain, thep 
opposite view, upon the ground that said policy, favorable to actual occupants, 
as incorporated in Commonwealth', Acts Nos. 20, 260 and 378, was 
<em>modified</em> by section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 539, in favor of "bona 
fide tenants," this expression having been inserted <em>before</em> the 
aforementioned "occupants" in the enumeration of the parties qualified to 
acquire lots under the said Commonwealth Act No. 539. .</p>
<p>We deem it unnecessary, however, to pass upon the issue thus raised by the 
parties, it appearing that <em>Dalisay Santos is a possessor in good faith of 
lot 12</em>, although portions thereof are physically held by 
plaintiffs-appellees, Domingo Josef and. Crisanto Grande. Moreover, considering 
that said lot has an area of 144 square meters only, which is barely enough for 
a single family; that Dalisay Santos, who does not appear to have any other 
property and belongs to the working class, needs it for herself; and that the 
subdivision ofi said lot into three portions and the adjudication thereof to 
Dalisay Santos, Domingo Josef and Crisanto Grande respectively, may, and, in all 
probability would—owing to the extremely limited size of each portion—lead to 
frictions, conflicts, misunderstandings and, perhaps, disturbances of the peace, 
which are precisely sought to be averted by Commonwealth Act No. 539, this Court 
is of the opinion, and so holds, that the action of the agency of. the 
government, charged with the administration and enforcement of. Commonwealth Act 
No. 539, in adjudicating lot 12 to Dalisay Santos, does not clearly conflict 
with,either the letter, or the spirit, of said legislative enactment and, hence, 
should not be disturbed by the judicial department.</p>
<p>Wherefore, the decision appealed from is, accordingly, reversed, and the 
complaints filed by plaintiffs-appellees hereby dismissed, with costs against 
said plaintiffs-appellees. It is so ordered.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista 
Angelo, Labrador</em>, and <em>Reyes, J. B. L., JJ.</em>, concur.</p></div>
