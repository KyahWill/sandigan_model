				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>For a period of nearly 22 years by a certificate of public convenience the Negros Ice &amp; Cold  Storage Co., Inc. was authorized to operate  and  has operated an ice  plant  with a daily productive capacity of 5 tons, and on 26 September 1950, to increase  it to  15 tons  (Appendix G; case  No. 58242), and to sell its production within the  Municipality of Bacolod later on converted into  Bacolod  City.   On  8 May  1952 the  operator filed an application in  the  Public Service Commission  praying  that  it be authorized  to sell its production  not only  within Bacolod City but also in the whole province  of Occidental Negros  (Appendix A; case No. 66402).  The Bacolod Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. Inc., that had its ice plant in Bacolod City and was  authorized to sell  its  production throughout Occidental Negros except in Bacolod City and  subsequently authorized  to sell it in the aforesaid city; the San Carlos Electric Co. that had  its 5-ton  plant  in  San Carlos  and  was authorized to sell its  production in San Carlos and Calatrava;  the Insular Lumber Co.  that had its  plant in  Fabrica and was  authorized  to  sell  its  production in  Fabrica and Paraiso; Jesus Campos who had  his  ice plant  in San Enrique and was authorized to sell his production in La Castellana,  Isabela,  La  Carlota, Pontevedra,  Valladolid, Pulupandan, Maao  and Murcia;  and  Elpidio  Javellana who had his 10-ton ice plant in Cadiz and was authorized  v to sell his  production in Cadiz. Manapla,  Fabrica, Sagay and Escalante, all filed  separate oppositions to the application  claiming that the efficient service they were rendering their respective authorized territories did not warrant the grant to the applicant of permission to bring and sell its ice outside Bacolod  City and within their respective authorized  territories.   Hearing  on  the case was commenced before  the Commission in Manila and, upon motion of the oppositors, continued before the Municipal Judge of Bacolod  City.  Only  the  Insular Lumber  Co. and the Bacolod Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc. presented evidence in support  of their oppositions.</p>
<p>On  23  August 1952  the  Public Service  Commission granted the applicant a provisional license  or permit to sell its production not  only in Bacolod  City but in  all the towns  of  Occidental Negros,  with the  exception of  Fabrica, subject to alteration or revocation  by the Commission at any time  and to whatever  decision  is  finally rendered in the case. </p>
<p>After hearing, on  28 August 1953  the Public  Service Commission rendered judgment the dispositive  part of  which is-</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>After due and careful consideration of all the oral and documentary evidence presented, and finding that public interests and convenience will be promoted by permitting the applicant  to sell ice in all  the towns of Occidental Negros, with the exception of Fabrica, Cadiz arid  Victorias,  the  Commission  hereby  approves  the  application filed in  this case  and  authorizes the applicant to sell  the ice produced in its ice  plant in Bacolod City not only in  Eacolod but in all  the town  of Occidental  Negros,  excepting  Fabrica,  Cadiz and  Victorias, and  applicant's certificate  of  public convenience in Case No. 58242  is  hereby  amended accordingly.</p>
  <p>The  provisional  authority  granted  in this case  by order  of August 23,  1952  is hereby revoked.   (Appendix  C.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bacolod Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc., comes to us and prays  for a review of  the judgment thus  rendered under the provisions  of section  35,  Com. Act No. 146 and section  1,  Rule 43.</p>
<p>The Public Service Commission made the following findings and  pronouncements:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>* * *  Evidence of the Bacolod Ice  &amp;  Cold  Storage  consists of the testimony of  witnesses Eliseo Emilia, Ernesto Boneto, Gregorio Villas, Julian Parreno,  Conrado Gamboa, Eusebio Dionila,  Francisco Orbe  and  L. Alit. "  The first  four testified  that  they  were engaged  in  the sale of  leche eon hielo and that they use ice every day but that all the ice that they need, they could  obtain  from the  Bacolod Ice  and they never had  any difficulty in obtaining this ice  from the  said oppositor. Witnesses  Gamboa and  Dionila testified  that they  operate fishing boats  in  Silay and  Bacolod and that the ice that they need for their boats they have always been able to  obtain  from the Bacolod Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. without any difficulty.  Orbe and  Alit  testified that as salesmen  of the Bacolod  Ice they  go  out  to other towns  of  the  province  and according  to their investigations there is  no  shortage  of  ice in  any  of  these towns because  of  the service  rendered  by the Bacolod  Ice Company.   The Manager of the  Bacolod  Ice  &amp; Cold Storage, Leandro Gruet, was  also presented to testify as to the alleged  losses suffered   by the said  company in  its  ice  business and identified  its  Exhibit "1"  showing that  in  the  months of August  to  November,  1952  and February and  March, 1953, the company suffered  losses,  and  Manuel  Roig,  supervisor  of the opponent company, testified to the fact  that the applicant  charges rates not authorized in  the sale of  its ice.   Rebuttal evidence was presented by the applicant consisting of the testimony of witnesses Antonio Gaston,  D. Espanilla and Cesar Dimson, the  testimony of the first being that as a  fishing boat operator,  he cannot always obtain  ice from the Bacolod  Ice  Company and even fishing  boats in Silay, and that this frequent shortage of ice would be remedied if another  operator  were permitted to  sell  in other  towns  of Negros  Occidental where there is  continuous demand for ice.  Dimson testified that as salesman of  the Negros Ice and Cold  Storage he has  found  that there are many towns  in  Negros where  an additional supply of ice would be beneficial to the public.</p>
  <p>We have gone over  the  evidence very carefully and are satisfied that  the preponderance of the evidence establishes  that  there is a public need for  authorizing the applicant to sell its ice in  other towns of Negros Occidental outside of Bacolod City.  It is sufficiently established that there  are  many places in Negros Occidental where ice service is very inadequate if not inexistent, and if this situation can be  remedied by  permitting   an  operator to bring  his  ice to these  places, we see  no  reason  why  an authority  to  this  effect should  not be granted.  The evidence of the, Bacolod Ice does  not satisfy  us that its  service in  al  the towns of  the  province is such that there  is no need  for  permitting  an  additional service which the  applicant  desires to  render.  The Manager  himself of the oppositor company admitted  that  there  are several towns in the province  where his company  does not send ice, mention having been made  of  the towns  of San Carlos, Calatrava  and  Toboso. And  as  to  the other  towns, there  is  no concrete  evidence that the oppositors render a service which may be considered  as regular. We take notice  of  the  numerous  towns  comprising the  province of Occidental Negros  and that many of them are quite distant from Bacolod  City thus resulting in  difficulties  in  rendering a  daily ice service to all these towns, and for this reason we are inclined to believe the  evidence of the  applicant that most of the  towns are not at present regularly served  by the  oppositor Bacolod  Ice. As part of  its  evidence,  oppositor  Bacolod  Ice  has presented  its Exhibit  "1"  purporting to  show losses suffered by it during certain months  of 1952  and  1953,  but  as  to  1952   it  appears  that' this loss was caused by typhoons which  visited  that province during the months   in  which  losses were  suffered  and which  adversely affected the sale of ice because  in other  months the same exhibit shows  profits made by the  company.  Furthermore,  said  exhibit while  showing  losses  does  not  point out  nor  indicate the real cause of said losses which may have been due to other  causes  but not necessarily  to  insufficient demand for ice  in towns outside of Bacolod  City.  There  are some  towns, however,  where  we  are not satisfied  from  the evidence  that applicant  should  be  allowed to bring  and  sell  its ice, these towns being Fabrica, Cadiz  and Victorias.  As to Fabrica, there  is an  ice  plant of the insular Lumber Co. in operation aside from another 5-ton plant authorized to Eduardo Lopez; as to  Cadiz, our records show that the grantee of the certificate, Elpidio Javellana, has already installed his 10-ton plant, and as to Victorias, the 4-ton plant  authorized therein  is actually in operation. We do not believe that  applicant should be allowed to send  its ice to these town  where  the ice service of the authorized operators  has not  been shown to be  deficient.   With the exception of these  three towns, we find that applicant has proven that there is a public need for authorizing it to bring and sell its ice in the rest of the towns of Occidental Negros.</p>

<p>Taking  into consideration the findings  of the Public Service  Commission "that there  is a public need  for authorizing the  applicant to sell its  ice  in other towns of Negros  Occidental outside of  Bacolod  City;"  "that there are  many places in Negros Occidental where  ice  service is very  inadequate if not inexistent;" that the  Bacolod Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co., Inc.  has not satisfactorily shown "that  its'service in all the towns of the  province  is such that there is no need for permitting an additional service which the applicant desires to render;" that the Manager himself  of the Bacolod Ice &amp; Cold  Storage Co.,  Inc. admitted "that there are several towns in  the province where his company does  not  send ice, mention having been made of the towns of San Carlos, Calatrava and Toboso;" that many of the towns of the province of Occidental  Negros are quite distant  from Bacolod  City which rendered  difficult a  daily ice service  to all such towns; and that for that  reason the Commission was inclined to  believe, as the  evidence  of  respondent  (applicant  in the   tribunal below) shows, that most of the towns of Occidental Negros were not then regularly  served,  not only by  the  Bacolod Ice &amp; Cold  Storage Co.,  Inc., but also by  the other oppositors authorized to operate ice plants, except Fabrica, Cadiz and Victorias where the ice service of  the  authorized operators was not shown to be deficient, we cannot say that there is no evidence on which the judgment Under review is predicated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>   The analysis made of the evidence for  the  respondent  and conclusion  drawn therefrom by counsel for the petitioner would be well taken and effective in  ordinary judicial vcases but not in  proceedings before the Public Service Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>The petitioner advances and claims  that the grant of the respondent's application would Vesult in ruinous competition.  The Public Service Commission, however, found and held that the losses suffered by the petitioner in some months of 1952 were  caused  by typhoons and that the losses suffered in 1953  may have been due to  other causes but not necessarily to insufficient demand for ice in municipalities outside Bacolod City.   The  finding  is  not arbitrary and whimsical  because the Commission took  judicial notice of typhoons that lashed Occidental Negros during the months of 1952  referred to and  the conjecture as to the  cause  of losses  in  1953  is not altogether baseless, because  during the months of 1952  and  1953 when the respondent was authorized provisionally to sell ice outside Bacolod  City, there were two months when the petitioner made profit.</p>
<p>The judgment of the Public  Service  Commission under review is affirmed, with costs  against the petitioner.</p>
