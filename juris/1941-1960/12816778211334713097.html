				<H3>AMANDO CALUAG DOMINGO, PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NUEVA ECIJA AND FELISA ROMAN VDA. DE MORENO, RESPONDENTS.
<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>In an ejectment case instituted in the justice of the peace court of San 
Antonio, Nueva Ecija, in which the respondent (Felisa Roman Vda. de Moreno) was 
the plaintiff and the petitioner (Amando Caluag Domingo) the defendant, the 
latter was sentenced, in a decision rendered on November 27, 1941, to vacate the 
controverted land and to pay P30 (unpaid balance of the rent from September, 
1940, to September, 1941), plus the sum of P65 annually thereafter until actual 
restitution of the land to Felisa Roman, and the costs. During the pendency of 
the appeal interposed by the petitioner in the Court of First Instance of Nueva 
Ecija, Felisa Roman filed a motion for the execution of the decision of the 
justice of the peace court in view of the failure of the petitioner to file a 
supersedeas bond and to pay to Felisa Roman or to the court the rents awarded in 
the decision of the justice of the peace court, whereupon the Court of First 
Instance of Nueva Ecija issued an order, dated September 9, 1943, directing the 
execution prayed for. The petitioner subsequently was able to have this order of 
execution lifted, but not without posting a bond for P1.000 required by the 
Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija in its order of August 2, 1944. Said bond 
(which was in Japanese military notes) was substituted by a cash bond for the 
same amount, but in Philippine currency, filed by agreement of the parties and 
approved by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija in the order of August 8, 
1945', which further provided that execution would automatically follow if said 
bond was not put up within twelve days. On December 20, 1945, notwithstanding 
the existence of this new bond, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, 
acceding to another petition of Felisa Roman, ordered "the execution of the 
decision under the provisions of Rule 72, of the Rules of Court." This last 
order is sought to be annulled in the certiorari proceedings now before us, 
instituted by the petitioner.</p>
<p>The attorney for the respondents contends—and this is the basis of the Court 
of First Instance of Nueva Ecija for directing the execution—that "apesar de 
haberse hecho el deposito de mil pesos por el demandado Caluag1 Domingo, primero 
en Japanese notes y despues en Philippine currency, ello vino a constituir 
solamente la fianza de super-sedeas provista en la segunda condition prevista 
para la suspension de la ejecucion," and that, if the petitioner wanted to have 
the execution suspended, he should have paid "al demandante o en la escribania 
del juzgado, tod as las cantidades que venia a ser condenado a pagar, desde el 
juzgado de paz, hasta la fecha de referencia 20 de diciembre de 1945, y del 
mismo modo en lo sucesivo, por cada pago que periodicamente debiera hacer segun 
la sentencia."</p>
<p>Ordinarily, under section 8 of Rule 72 of the Rules of Court, the winning 
plaintiff in an ejectment case is entitled to move for immediate execution—and 
the court is bound to grant the same,—unless the defendant, who 1ms appealed 
from the decision of the justice of the peace or municipal court, files a 
supersedeas bond and, during the pendency of the appeal, pays to the plaintiff 
or to the court the rents due from time to time. The facts of the case at bar, 
however, show that the respondent Felisa Roman, by her own act, had waived her 
right to immediate execution, in that she, after the petitioner had already 
failed to pay the rente that fell due after the decision of the justice of the 
peace court of November 27, 1941, had on two occasions agreed to suspend 
execution upon the mere filing by the petitioner of a cash bond for P1,000, 
first in 1944 (Japanese notes) and, then, in 1945 (Philippine currency). Indeed, 
the agreement was approved by the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija in its 
order of August 8, 1945, which recited partly as follows: "Aprobando este 
convenio, por la presente se fija en P1,000 la fianza que debe prestar el 
demandado dentro del termino de 12 dias, a contar desde la fecha de la presente 
orden; entendiendose que si asi no lo hiciera, automaticamente se ordenara la 
ejucion de la sentencia del juzgado de paz."</p>
<p>That the sense of the agreement; referred to and ap proved in this order was 
to suspend execution after the filing of the cash bond, is clearly deduced from 
the warning "entendiendose que si asi no lo hiciera, automaticamente se ordenara 
la ejecucidn de la sentencia del juzgado de paz," and from the amount of said 
bond which is sufficient to cover the rents for more than ten years, it 
appearing that the decision of the justice of the peace court sentenced the 
petitioner to pay only P30 (unpaid balance from September, 1940, to September, 
1941) and P65 yearly from September, 1941, plus the costs, and that the back 
rents in 1945 when the cash bond of P1,000 was'filed, amounted to the 
insignificant sum of P290. If, as held in Mitschiener vs. Barrios (76 Phil., 
55), the supersedeas bond "has, in effect, the purpose of securing only the pay 
ment of rents in arrears," the amount of P1,000 was absively excessive if it was 
not intended to cqver also future rents.;</p>
<p>In this connection, it also appears that on October 31, 1945, the Court of 
First Instancy of Nueva Ecija decided the ejectment case in favor of tjie 
plaintiff; that on November 29, 1945, the motion for execution" was filed, which 
was granted—as already noted—in the order of December 20, 1945; that the 
subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied on the ground that the cash 
deposit of P1,000 did not take the place of a supersedeas bond "first because it 
was not given as such, and second—the deposit was made before the decision the 
execution of which has been asked for." The first reason requires no other 
comment than that the attorney for the respondents herein now admits that said 
deposit "vino a constituir * * * la fianza de super sedeos." As to the second 
reason, it may be remarked that the cash bond of P1,000 filed before the 
rendition of the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, 
continued to serve its purpose and effect thereafter, as may be inferred from 
section 9 of Rule 72 which provides that "where the defendant appeals from 
judgment of the Court of First Instance, execution of said judgment shall not be 
stayed unless the appellant pays either to the plaintiff or into the appellate 
court the same amounts referred to in the preceding section to be disposed of in 
the same manner as therein provided." Of course, the record does not show that 
the petitioner had duly appealed. At the same time, it is not here pretended by 
the respondents that the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija 
has become final and executory.</p>
<p>It results that we need not pass upon petitioner's allegation that the order 
of execution of December 20, 1945, was issued without previous notice to him, 
although, of course, a writ of execution may only be issued by the court in 
ejectment cases after notice to the adverse party. (Section 8, Rule 72; Angel 
Jose Realty Corp. vs. Galao, 76 Phil., 201.)</p>
<p>The petition for certiorari is, therefore, granted and the order of the Court 
of First Instance of Nueva Ecija dated December 20, 1945, set aside, with costs 
against the respondent Felisa Roman Vda. do Moreno. So ordered.</p>Moran, C. J., 
Feria, Pablo, Perfecto, Bengzon, Briones, and Tuason, JJ., concur. <br><br><br>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PADILLA, J.</strong>, with whom concurs <strong>HILADO, 
J.:</strong></p>
<p>I dissent. This case can not yet be decided in view of the divergent 
allegations of the petitioner and the respondent Moreno as disclosed by their 
pleadings. Petitioner should not be allowed to withhold facts that must be laid 
before this court. He failed to append to his petition his answer filed in the 
respondent court, but in lieu thereof attached a copy of the judgment rendered 
by the justice of the peace of San Antonio, Nueva Ecija. The allegation in 
paragraph XI of his petition that the motion for execution filed by respondent 
Moreno on November 29, ,1945, was without notice of hearing to petitioner and 
that it was filed before the determination of the case on the merits, is denied 
by respondent Moreno.</p>
<p>The latter pleads that the motion was with notice of hearing and that it was 
filed after judgment on the merits had been rendered by the respondent court on 
October 31, 1945. This last allegation seems to be supported by the orders of 
December 20, 1945 and January 18, 1946 entered by the respondent court (Exhibits 
I and L). In paragraph XVI of the petition, it is alleged that the respondent 
court refused to allow petitioner to file a bond to answer for rentals due. This 
is denied by respondent Moreno.</p>
<p>I believe that the interest of justice would be best subserved by directing 
the respondent court to forward the record of the case for review by this 
court.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if, despite such divergent allegations, this court feels that 
it can decide the case, I would still dissent, because whether the case had been 
or has not been decided on the merits by the respondent court, the order of 
execution of December 20, 1945, was issued because of petitioner's failure to 
pay the rentals at the rate of PG5 a year from 1941 to 1945. The cash bond of 
?l,000 can not be deemed a compliance with petitioner's obligation, during the 
pendency of the appeal, to pay to the plaintiff or into the court the rentals ns 
they fall due, either under section 8 or under section 9, Rule 72, of the Rules 
of Court.</p>
