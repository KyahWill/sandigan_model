				<BR><STRONG>REYES, A., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In three separate informations identically worded except that each referred to a different offended&nbsp; party, Corazon Aquino was accused, before the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, of&nbsp; the&nbsp; crime of&nbsp; grave oral&nbsp; defamation&nbsp; for having allegedly uttered in&nbsp; public,&nbsp; on or about June 4, 1954, words to&nbsp; this&nbsp; effect:&nbsp; "You, Merrera lawyers,&nbsp; are stealers ***&nbsp;&nbsp; shameless ***&nbsp;&nbsp; impolite." . Three&nbsp;&nbsp; informations&nbsp; were filed&nbsp; on the theory that, as there were three lawyers bearing the&nbsp; surname&nbsp; "Merrera",&nbsp; three separate crime of&nbsp; defamation&nbsp; were committed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; the&nbsp; lower court, upon motion of the defense, ordered the informations consolidated into one on the ground that, as the defamatory statement was uttered but once and on a single occasion against a group&nbsp; of persons not mentioned individually, the act complained of constituted only one offense.&nbsp; From this order, the&nbsp; prosecution appealed to this Court.<p>In&nbsp; support&nbsp; of its order,&nbsp; the lower&nbsp; court cites various cases of libel&nbsp; decided by this Court (among them,&nbsp; that of U.&nbsp; S. <em>vs.</em> Kelly,&nbsp; 35&nbsp; Phil., 419)&nbsp; in which, regardless of the number of persons libelled, the accused were sentenced for only one offense.&nbsp; The court also&nbsp; cites decisions holding that a person who, on the same occasion and in the same place, steals properties belonging to&nbsp; different&nbsp; owners,&nbsp; is guilty of only one crime of theft.</p><p>At common law, "a libel on two&nbsp; or more persons contained in one writing and published by a single&nbsp; act constitutes but one&nbsp; offense so as to warrant a single&nbsp; indictment therefor"&nbsp; (State <em>vs.</em> Hoskins, 60 Minn., 168), this for the reason that "the law makes the publication of libel punishable as a crime, not because of&nbsp; injury to the reputation, but because the publication of&nbsp; such articles tends to affect injuriously the&nbsp; peace and good&nbsp; order of&nbsp; society." The Solicitor General, however, cites&nbsp; the case of People <em>vs.</em> Del&nbsp; Rosario, et al.&nbsp; (86 Phil.,&nbsp; 163) where this Court upheld the&nbsp; theory&nbsp; that&nbsp; a "libelous publication&nbsp; affecting more&nbsp; than&nbsp; one&nbsp; person&nbsp; constitutes one crime or&nbsp; more". That&nbsp; decision,&nbsp; it is to&nbsp; be noted,&nbsp; was&nbsp; predicated&nbsp; on&nbsp; the ruling laid down in the case of People <em>vs.</em> Luz Jose, 76 Phil.&nbsp; 599, to the effect that libel&nbsp; or defamation—of the nature of that committed in the present cases—cannot be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>&nbsp; but only at the&nbsp; instance of the offended party&nbsp; or parties, from&nbsp; which this&nbsp; Court deduced the conclusion that in libel or&nbsp; defamation&nbsp; of that kind the policy of the law is to redress the injury&nbsp; to the individual rather than the&nbsp; injury to&nbsp; the&nbsp; peace and&nbsp; good order of society. But that conclusion is now without basis, for the&nbsp; said case of People <em>vs.</em>&nbsp; Luz Jose&nbsp; had already been overruled by the more&nbsp; recent cases&nbsp; of&nbsp; People <em>vs.</em> Juan B. Santos,&nbsp; et al. (98 Phil., Ill), promulgated December&nbsp; 19,&nbsp; 1955&nbsp; where this Court said:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"A libel is a public and malicious imputation of a crime that may be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>, or of a crime that may not be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>, 'or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition,&nbsp; status, or circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or&nbsp; contempt of a natural&nbsp; or&nbsp; juridical&nbsp; person, or to&nbsp; blacken the memory of one who is dead&nbsp; In libel imputing the commission of a crime that may be prosecuted&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">de&nbsp; oficio</span>, the complaint of the offended party&nbsp; is not&nbsp; necessary,&nbsp; and the information filed by the prosecuting officer is enough to confer&nbsp; jurisdiction upon the court to try the&nbsp; defendant charged with the crime.&nbsp; A libel imputing the commission of a crime which cannot&nbsp; be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span>, such as adultery, concubinage,&nbsp; seduction,&nbsp; abduction, rape&nbsp; and acts of lasciviousness, cannot be prosecuted except at the instance of and upon complaint expressly filed by the offended party.&nbsp;&nbsp; A libel attributing a defect or vice, real or&nbsp; imaginary, which&nbsp; does not constitute a crime but&nbsp; brings into&nbsp; disrepute, scorn or ridicule or&nbsp; tends to cause him dishonor,&nbsp; discredit, or&nbsp; contempt, does not come under the last paragraph of article 360 of the Revised Penal Code which provides that 'No criminal action for defamation which consists, in the imputation of a crime which cannot be prosecuted <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio</span> shall be brought except at the instance of and upon complaint expressly filed by the offended party.'&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the only exception provided for by law in which the instance and complaint of the offended party are required in order&nbsp; to vest or confer jurisdiction upon the court to take cognizance of the crime of libel and try the defendant charged with it. If this is the only exception, then it cannot be extended&nbsp; beyond the import and terms of the law.&nbsp; A&nbsp; libel ascribing a defect or vice, real or imaginary, which does not&nbsp; constitute a crime but brings or tends to&nbsp; bring the offended party into disrepute, scorn,&nbsp; or ridicule or tends to cause him dishonor,&nbsp; discredit, or contempt is not included in the exception.&nbsp; Hence the informations filed by the Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Nueva Ecija for the City Attorney charging the defendants with&nbsp; libel which consists of an imputation of&nbsp; a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of&nbsp; a&nbsp; natural or juridical person, are sufficient in&nbsp; law to&nbsp; confer jurisdiction upon the court to try the defendants charged with the crime."</p></blockquote><p>In line with this latter decision, we have to hold that the utterance of the defamatory statement complained of in the present cases&nbsp; should be regarded as only one offense and made the subject of only one information, the utterance having been made&nbsp; but once and referring apparently&nbsp; to a family of lawyers designated by&nbsp; their common surname but not separately mentioned.</p><p>Wherefore, the&nbsp; order&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from is affirmed.&nbsp;&nbsp; No costs.</p><p><em>Paras,. C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,&nbsp; Montemayor, Bautista Angelo, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia,</em> and <em>Felix, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
