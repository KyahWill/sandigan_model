				<BR><BR><p></p><div align="justify">The plaintiffs-appellees filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija against the&nbsp; defendants-appellants, to compel the latter to&nbsp; convey to the former the two parcels&nbsp; of land&nbsp; described&nbsp; in the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; and to recover fifty <span style="font-style: italic;">cavanes</span> of palay annually beginning the agricultural years 1951-1952, or their&nbsp; equivalent money value at&nbsp; twelve&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; per cavan;&nbsp; it being alleged that appellees&nbsp; gave&nbsp; to the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of P2,000 for the latter to buy in behalf and for the account off the former the said parcels&nbsp; of land but&nbsp; that,&nbsp; contrary to their&nbsp; agreement,&nbsp; the appellants made&nbsp; the purchase in their own&nbsp; name and have refused to deliver&nbsp; the land to the appellees.<p>In their answer the appellants alleged that they neither received from the appellees the sum of P2,000 nor agreed to buy&nbsp; the land in question for appellees'&nbsp; account,&nbsp; the truth being that&nbsp; they purchased the same for themselves.</p><p>The appellants Subsequently filed a motion to dismiss, setting&nbsp; up the statute of frauds and alleging that an express trust, upon which appellees' cause&nbsp; of&nbsp; action was based, cannot be&nbsp; proved by&nbsp; parole evidence.&nbsp; After&nbsp; the appellees&nbsp; had filed their answer to&nbsp; the motion&nbsp; to dismiss, and after preliminary hearing, the&nbsp; court issued an order on January 28, 1953, the dispositive part of which reads as follows: "Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court finds that the claim of the&nbsp; plaintiffs as&nbsp; set&nbsp; forth' in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint is&nbsp; one based upon an express trust, there being&nbsp; no writing or memorandum&nbsp; it is barred by&nbsp; the statute of frauds, apart from the fact that it cannot be proved by parole evidence; and&nbsp; pursuant&nbsp; to the&nbsp; provisions of Rule&nbsp; 8,&nbsp; section 1, paragraph (<span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>) of the&nbsp; Rules of Court,&nbsp; the complaint is dismissed&nbsp; with costs&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiffs."&nbsp; The&nbsp; appellees&nbsp; thereafter filed a motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration in so far&nbsp; only&nbsp; as the court dismissed the&nbsp; complaint even with&nbsp; reference to their right&nbsp; to recover&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum of P2,000 from&nbsp; the appellants.&nbsp; On April&nbsp; 15, 1953, the court issued an order&nbsp; reconsidering the order&nbsp; of January 28, 1953, "in the sense that the complaint in so&nbsp; far as the alleged&nbsp; delivery and return of the money&nbsp; in question are concerned, be as it is hereby&nbsp; reinstated." A&nbsp; subsequent motion&nbsp; for reconsideration filed by appellants was denied, and the trial of the case&nbsp; was set for September 20, 1953. On this date,&nbsp; in view&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; attorney for appellants, and upon&nbsp; motion&nbsp; of attorney for appellees, the trial was postponed&nbsp; to&nbsp; October 15, 1953, when there was again no appearance for appellants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon the court allowed&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellees&nbsp; to present&nbsp; their evidence; and on&nbsp; December 8, 1953, a judgment&nbsp; was rendered, sentencing the appellants to&nbsp; return to the appellees the sum of P2,000, with legal interest from the date of the filing of the complaint, and to pay&nbsp; the&nbsp; costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; defendants have appealed.</p><p>It is&nbsp; argued for appellants&nbsp; that the lower court erred in reinstating&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint and&nbsp; in sentencing them to return to the appellees the&nbsp; sum of P2,000,&nbsp; because said matter&nbsp; was not litigated under the pleadings&nbsp; and when said court dismissed the&nbsp; complaint on January 28, 1953, nothing&nbsp; remained&nbsp; before it&nbsp; for&nbsp; adjudication.&nbsp; This is without&nbsp; foundation.&nbsp; Pleadings&nbsp; are to be liberally construed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaint alleged the delivery to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sum of P2,000, with the&nbsp; agreement&nbsp; on the latter's&nbsp; part&nbsp; to buy the&nbsp; land&nbsp; in question in&nbsp; behalf&nbsp; and for the account of the appellees;&nbsp; and&nbsp; in&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to the specific prayer for the conveyance by the appellants to the&nbsp; appellees&nbsp; of&nbsp; said&nbsp; land,&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; prayed&nbsp; for "other&nbsp; relief which may be&nbsp; just and equitable&nbsp; in the premises."&nbsp; Ours are courts of law and equity.&nbsp; In view of the dismissal of the&nbsp; complaint as&nbsp; to the&nbsp; recovery of the land in&nbsp; question, on the&nbsp; technical ground that an express&nbsp; trust&nbsp; cannot be&nbsp; proved&nbsp; by&nbsp; parol evidence,&nbsp; it was but just and equitable&nbsp; under the allegations of the complaint&nbsp; and the prayer for other relief,&nbsp; for the court to proceed with the determination of the question whether or&nbsp; not&nbsp; the appellees paid to&nbsp; the&nbsp; appellants the sum of P2,000 and whether the latter should be ordered to return the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; Aguilar&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Rubiato, 40 Phil., 570, it&nbsp; was held:&nbsp; "That payment&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sum of&nbsp; P800&nbsp; was&nbsp; not explicitly prayed for in the complaint, does not deprive the court of power to&nbsp; render judgment for this amount because&nbsp; it is a rule of good&nbsp; pleading&nbsp; that the&nbsp; 'demand in the complaint is no part of the statement of the cause of action.&nbsp;&nbsp; The facts alleged do this, and the plaintiff is entitled&nbsp; to so&nbsp; much&nbsp; relief&nbsp; as they&nbsp; warrant.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, section&nbsp; 9 of Rule 35 of the Rules&nbsp; of Court provides that "the judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in&nbsp; whose&nbsp; favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.''</p><p>But it is urged for the appellants that, assuming that the return .or delivery&nbsp; of the&nbsp; sum of P2,000 was a part of appellees' cause of action, the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija did not have jurisdiction over the matter, as&nbsp; the&nbsp; justice of the peace or&nbsp; municipal court&nbsp; has exclusive original jurisdiction where the value of the subject matter or amount&nbsp; demanded does not&nbsp; exceed P2,000 exclusive of interest and costs&nbsp; (section 88, Republic&nbsp; Act No. 296).&nbsp;&nbsp; This contention would&nbsp; be tenable, if the complaint was&nbsp; solely&nbsp; for the&nbsp; collection&nbsp; of&nbsp; said amount,&nbsp; but not where, as&nbsp; in the&nbsp; case&nbsp; at bar,&nbsp; it&nbsp; was merely part and parcel of the complaint for the&nbsp; recovery of land.</p><p>It&nbsp; appearing that due notice&nbsp; was&nbsp; served&nbsp; upon&nbsp; the appellants'&nbsp; first, of the&nbsp; hearing&nbsp; set for&nbsp; September 20, and secondly, of the hearing set&nbsp; for&nbsp; October 15, 1953, their&nbsp; failure to appear amounted to a&nbsp; waiver of their day in court.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not pretended that the appealed judgment is&nbsp; not supported&nbsp; by ,the evidence presented&nbsp; by the appellees.</p><p>Wherefore,&nbsp; the appealed judgment is&nbsp; affirmed,&nbsp; and it is so ordered&nbsp; with costs against the&nbsp; appellants.</p><p><em>Padilla, Montemayor, Bautista Angelo,&nbsp; Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J.
