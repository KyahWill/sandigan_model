				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The municipality of Bansud, Oriental Mindoro, was newly created by
Republic Act No. 2514 which was approved on June 21, 1959. On November
10, 1959, said municipality held for the first time an election to fill
its municipal offices, including that of mayor, and among the
candidates who filed their certificates for this office were Filemon
Salcedo, Jr. and Leon Mampusti.<p></p>
<p>On November 24, 1959, the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro,
acting as municipal board of canvassers of the new municipality
pursuant to the provisions of Section 167 (b) of the Revised Election
Code, proclaimed Salcedo as mayor-elect with a plurality of
seventy-nine (79) votes. Mampusti, who considered the proclamation
invalid because the canvass was made by the provincial board and not by
the municipal council of the new municipality, filed a petition with
the Commission on Elections praying for the annulment of the canvass
and proclamation made by said provincial board, and acting on the
petition, the Commission on Elections, after proper hearing, issued a
resolution on December 3, 1959 (1) annulling the canvass and
proclamation as prayed for; (2) ordering the municipal board of
canvassers of the new municipality to immediately make a new canvass of
all the votes cast for the municipal offices in said municipality and,
thereafter, proclaim the winning candidates; and (3) ordering the
provincial board to deliver to the municipal treasurer all election
returns submitted by the inspectors of said municipality. And
considering that the Commission on Elections has no power, nor
authority, to annul the canvass and proclamation made by the Provincial
Board of Oriental Mindoro because its authority is merely to act on
administrative questions, Filemon Salcedo, Jr. filed the present
petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction before this Court
praying for the setting aside of its resolution and for an order
restraining it from carrying out the instructions and orders contained
therein. This Court gave due course to the petition and issued a writ
of preliminary injunction upon petitioner's filing a bond in the amount
of P1,000.00.</p>
<p>Respondents in their answer state that the canvass and proclamation
made by the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro are null and void as
said board was composed of Governor Francisco Infantado and members
Leonardo Macasaet and Jose Basa who were disqualified to sit on said
board because they were all candidates for re-election (Section 28,
Revised Election Code); that, even assuming that the Provincial Board
of Oriental Mindoro could act as board of canvassers of the new
municipality, however, having failed to include in the canvass the
election return of Precinct No. 5 of said municipality, the canvass and
proclamation made are null and void, while the Commission on Elections
has the power and authority to declare a proclamation made on
incomplete returns null and void (Mintu, et al. <em>vs</em>. Enage, et al., G. R. No. L-1834; Abandante <em>vs</em>.
Relato, 94., 8) and that the Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro,
assuming that its members were qualified to act, could not lawfully act
as municipal board of canvassers for the reason that at the time it
arrogated unto itself the powers and functions of said municipal board
of canvassers there was already a duly constituted set of municipal
officers, or a municipal council was already then in existence.
Respondents prayed that the petition be dismissed and the injunction
dissolved.</p>
<p>There is merit in the contention that the Provincial Board of
Oriental Mindoro erroneously acted as municipal Board of canvassers of
the new municipality for the simple reason that at the time it acted as
such there was already a; municipal council then in existence. While
Section 167 (b) of the Revised Election Code provides that "For the
first election in a new municipality, the provincial board shall act as
board of canvassers to proclaim the result of the municipal elections",
however, this provision should be interpreted in conjunction with
Section 10 of the same Code which provides that "In the absence of a
municipal or city council, the provincial board shall perform the
duties of the former with respect to the first election in the new
political subdivision", from which it is logical to infer that even if
a new municipality is holding its first election to fill its municipal
offices, the provincial board can only assume the functions of a
municipal board of canvassers if the municipal council concerned has
not yet been constituted, otherwise the latter should act. Verily, the
provisions of Section 167 (b) are merely temporary in character which
apply when the offices of the new municipality have not yet been duly
filed.</p>
<p>An added reason for the nullification of the actuation, of the
Provincial Board of Oriental Mindoro is the fact that its members were
all disqualified to act it appearing that they were all candidates for
reelection. This is clear from Section 28 of the Revised Election Code
which provides that any member of the provincial board who is a
candidate for an elective office shall be incompetent to act in said
board in the performance of its duties in connection with the election.</p>
<p>Finally, we find that the Commission on Elections acted properly in
nullifying the canvass and proclamation made by the Provincial Board of
Oriental Mindoro not only on the grounds already mentioned but in view
of the fact that said board failed to include in its canvass the
election return for Precinct No. 5 in contravention of law and of the
instructions given by the Commission on Elections (Mintu, et al. <em>vs</em>. Enage, et al., <em>supra</em>; Abendante <em>vs</em>. Relato, <em>supra</em>).</p>
<p>Wherefore, petition is dismissed. The injunction issued by this Court is hereby dissolved. Costs against petitioner.</p>
<p><em>Paras, C. J., Bengzon, Padilla, Montemayor, Labrador, Concepcion, Reyes, J. B. L., Endencia, Barrera,</em> and <em>Gutierrez David, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
