				<H3>BENITO FERRER Y RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONER, VS. POTENCIANO PECSON, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MONTEMAYOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On March 1, 1949, petitioner Benito Ferrer y Rodriguez was 
accused before the Municipal Court of Manila of serious physical injuries 
through reckless imprudence under criminal case No. 10050 of said court. The 
complaint alleged that on February 2, 1949, in the City of Manila, petitioner, 
driver of a jeepney, operated it along Dapitan Street in a careless, reckless 
and imprudent manner as a result of which said jeepney driven by him sidewiped 
another jeepney thereby causing a collision, inflicting on a passenger named 
Avelino Tiu physical injuries consisting of fracture compound, communited, 
middle third, humerus left; fracture compound, communited, neck, radius, left, 
fracture, simple, middle third, radius, ulna left, which injuries have required 
and will require medical attendance for a period of from six (6) to eight (8) 
months and have prevented and will prevent the said offended party from engaging 
in his customary labor during the same period of time. After trial the Municipal 
Court of Manila found him guilty and sentenced him to three (3) months of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span>. Defendant appealed the case to the Court of First Instance of 
Manila. 
<p align="justify">On November 27, 1950, petitioner through counsel filed a motion 
to dismiss the case on the ground that the Municipal Court of Manila had no 
jurisdiction over the offense and, consequently, the court of first instance had 
no appellate jurisdiction. The motion to dismiss was denied by Judge Potenciano 
Pecson presiding over the court of first instance, but upon motion for 
reconsideration, the same judge in his order of June 6, 1951 (Annex D), granted 
the motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. 
On a motion for reconsideration filed by the fiscal, Judge Pecson in his order 
dated August 29, 1951 (Annex E), revoked his order of June 6, 1951 (Annex D) and 
declared his first order of December 14, 1950, denying the motion to dismiss as 
in force. Counsel for defendant Ferrer asked for a reconsideration of this order 
and upon denial of his motion by order of the respondent judge dated October 31, 
1951 (Annex I), has filed the present petition for certiorari to revoke the 
order of August 29, 1951 (Annex E), and to reinstate the order of June 6, 1951 
(Annex D). </p>
<p align="justify">After a careful study of this case, we are inclined to agree 
with the petitioner. The jurisdiction of a court to try a criminal case is to be 
determined by the law at the time of the institution of the action (People vs. 
Pegarum, 58 Phil., 715). At the time that the complaint in this case was filed 
on March 1, 1949, in the Municipal Court of Manila, the law penalizing the act 
imputed to the petitioner was the Revised Motor Vehicle Law (Act No. 3932), 
section 67 of which provides that if as a result of negligence or reckless or 
unreasonably fast driving any accident occurs resulting in death or serious 
bodily injury to any person, the one responsible upon conviction shall be 
punished by imprisonment for not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than six 
(6) years in the discretion of the court. </p>
<p align="justify">According to a series of cases decided by this court, among 
them that of Eustaquio vs. Liwag (86 Phil., 540) and People vs. Moreno (60 
Phil., 712), an act of negligence or reckless or unreasonably fast driving 
resulting in death or serious physical injuries to any person, should be 
prosecuted under section 67 of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law and not under the 
Revised Penal Code. </p>
<p align="justify">The criminal jurisdiction of a justice of the peace or a 
municipal court as defined in the Judiciary Act of 1948 approved in June, 1948, 
is confined to offenses in which the penalty is not more than six (6) months. 
From this it is dear that the Municipal Court of Manila had no jurisdiction over 
this case where a maximum penalty of six (6) years may be imposed; and if it had 
no original jurisdiction, the court of first instance presided over by Judge 
Pecson had likewise no appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">It is true that section 67 of the Revised Motor Vehicle Law 
(Act No. 3932) was amended by section 16 of Republic Act No. 587 which went into 
effect on January 1, 1951, in the sense that acts of negligence or reckless or 
unreasonably fast driving resulting in death or serious bodily injury upon any 
person shall be prosecuted and punished under the provisions of the Revised 
Penal Code. But this Act may not be given retroactive effect so as to confer on 
the municipal court jurisdiction which it did not have when it tried and decided 
the case against petitioner. It may be true that the provisions of the Pena] 
Code are more favorable to the petitioner in this case as regards the penalty, 
but when the very accused (herein petitioner) far from invoking the benefits of 
said Republic Act No. 587, disregards it and instead, invokes the Revised Motor 
Vehicle Law (Act No. 3932) which was in force at the time that the acts imputed 
to him were committed, at least for that reason alone the question of 
retroactivity can not and will not be considered. </p>
<p align="justify">Respondents contend that under the Judiciary Act of 1948 as 
well as the Charter of the City of Manila, the Municipal Court of Manila is 
given jurisdicton to try criminal cases of assaults where the intent to kill is 
not alleged or is not evident from the evidence, regardless of the penalty 
attached to the crime. But it is obvious that acts of negligence in the 
operation of a motor vehicle which cause a collision and result in physical 
injuries can hardly be regarded as assaults without the intent to kill.</p>
<p align="justify">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is 
hereby granted and the order of respondent judge of June 6, 1951 (Annex D) 
dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction is hereby reinstated. No costs.</p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Paras C. J., Pablo, Bengzon, Padilla, Jugo, Bautista Angelo,</span> and
