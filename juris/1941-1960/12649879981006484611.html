				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from&nbsp; an order of the Court of First Instance of Capizj dated September 18, 1953, dismissing the complaint filed in&nbsp; the above-entitled case,&nbsp; and from another&nbsp; order,&nbsp; dated November&nbsp; 14,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; denying&nbsp; this motion&nbsp; for reconsideration of the order of dismissal as well as&nbsp; the admission of an&nbsp; amended complaint,&nbsp; but authorizing plaintiff Jose A.&nbsp; Arches to file a separate action against&nbsp; William&nbsp; Villarruz for the&nbsp; collection of the sums of money mentioned&nbsp; in the complaint.<br><br>Plaintiff filed his&nbsp; complaint under Act No. 3688.&nbsp; He alleged therein that William Villarruz entered into a contract with&nbsp; the&nbsp; Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; for&nbsp; the construction of&nbsp; Ivisan&nbsp; Bridge&nbsp; and&nbsp; Approaches,&nbsp; Capiz- Iloilo Road, Project&nbsp; No. PR-48&nbsp; (1); that as required by law, William Villarruz together&nbsp; with the&nbsp; Visayan Surety &amp; Insurance Corporation executed a surety bond whereby they agreed jointly&nbsp; and severally to pay 1*16,871, Philippine&nbsp; currency, in favor&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines and to&nbsp; "any&nbsp; individual,&nbsp; firm, partnership, corporation,&nbsp; or&nbsp; association supplying the contractor&nbsp; and principal,&nbsp; William&nbsp; Villarruz, with labor and materials which may be used&nbsp; in the&nbsp; construction of&nbsp; said bridge"; that "defendant contractor William Villarruz, as principal, on&nbsp; various&nbsp; times and on&nbsp; various&nbsp; occasions&nbsp; prior thereto had obtained money from the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; Jose&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Arches and paid&nbsp; for&nbsp; labor and&nbsp; materials&nbsp; to&nbsp; help finance&nbsp; the construction and completion of his specific contract work with the Government, Project No. PR-48 (1)&nbsp; Ivisan Bridge and Approaches, Capiz-IIoilo Road, as follows:&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="82%">a.

Arches had no&nbsp; right to present the&nbsp; complaint&nbsp; in&nbsp; his own name in order to enforce the bond&nbsp; Annex&nbsp; "A", and&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; that "the action&nbsp; should&nbsp; have been&nbsp; filed&nbsp; in&nbsp; the name of the Government&nbsp; of the Philippines&nbsp; as provided&nbsp; expressly in said&nbsp; Act No. 3688 and that, granting the allegations of the complaint to be true,&nbsp; they do not constitute a cause of action against&nbsp; defendant Visayan&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; &amp; Insurance Corporation, because, under the&nbsp; bond, it is only liable for unpaid claims&nbsp; in&nbsp; favor of <i>any&nbsp; individual, firm,&nbsp; partnership, corporation,&nbsp; or association supplying the&nbsp; contractor with labor or materials for the prosecution of the&nbsp; work</i>, and&nbsp; as&nbsp; the plaintiff had&nbsp; advanced sums of money,&nbsp; and not&nbsp; labor&nbsp; or materials, as so appears&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint, plaintiff has no right to demand from this defendant the sums of money claimed in the complaint." <br><br>When the case&nbsp; was&nbsp; called for hearing&nbsp; on March 2, 1953, defendant Visayan Surety &amp; Insurance Corporation, without&nbsp; filing any&nbsp; formal&nbsp; motion to dismiss, invoked the provisions of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 5, Rule&nbsp; 8 of the Rules&nbsp; of&nbsp; Court and petitioned the court that the&nbsp; affirmative&nbsp; defenses averred in its answer&nbsp; be first&nbsp; considered and&nbsp; decided&nbsp; in a&nbsp; preliminary hearing.&nbsp; The&nbsp; court&nbsp; granted the&nbsp; petition and ordered&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties to&nbsp; file&nbsp; their respective&nbsp; memoranda.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereafter, on September 18,&nbsp; 1953, the court&nbsp; upheld&nbsp; the&nbsp; affirmative defenses&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Visayan&nbsp; Surety &amp;. Insurance&nbsp; Corporation and&nbsp; dismissed the&nbsp; complaint.<br><br>On October 24,&nbsp; 1953,&nbsp; plaintiff filed a motion for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; of&nbsp; the order of dismissal,&nbsp; praying" at&nbsp; the same&nbsp; time for the admission&nbsp; of&nbsp; an amended complaint, paragraphs 5, 6 and 7&nbsp; of which are as follows:<br><blockquote>"V—-That prior to July&nbsp; 16, 1950,&nbsp; up&nbsp; to&nbsp; the date the Government took over&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; construction and&nbsp; completion of&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Project PR-48 (1)&nbsp; in 1951 from defendant Villarruz, and in&nbsp; consideration of, and&nbsp; covered by,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; Surety&nbsp; Bond, Annex&nbsp; 'A', plaintiff Jose A,&nbsp; Arches supplied&nbsp; defendant William Villarruz,&nbsp; from&nbsp; time to time as per requisitions,&nbsp; with,&nbsp; materials which&nbsp; Villarruz&nbsp; needed for, and actually used in, his&nbsp; undertaking&nbsp; or&nbsp; construction&nbsp; of the said Ivisan Bridge&nbsp; and&nbsp; Approaches, and that&nbsp; the values&nbsp; of&nbsp; the said materials&nbsp; supplied by&nbsp; plaintiff Jose&nbsp; A. Arches&nbsp; to&nbsp; defendant William Villarruz are accounted and&nbsp; evidenced by the following promissory&nbsp; notes the latter executed:<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; Promissory note&nbsp; with collateral&nbsp; security&nbsp; for paymentf in the&nbsp; amount of P8,400 dated July 16, 1950, at&nbsp; 10%&nbsp; interest per&nbsp; annum, and subject&nbsp; to&nbsp; 10% fop&nbsp; attorneys'&nbsp; fees,&nbsp; 10% for liquidated damages,&nbsp; and for court costs.<br><br>(2)&nbsp; Promissory note in the amount&nbsp; of Pl,397, dated December 4, 1950, at 10% interest per annum, and&nbsp; subject to 10% for attorney's&nbsp; fees,&nbsp; 10%&nbsp; for liquidated damages, and for&nbsp; costs. (3) Promissory note&nbsp; in the amount of Fl,092, dated January 16, 1951, at 10% per annum, and subject to 10%&nbsp; for attorneys' fees,&nbsp; 10%&nbsp; for liquidated damages,&nbsp; and for&nbsp; costs. (4) Promissory note in the amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; Pl,300, dated April 19, 1951, at 10%j per annum, and subject to 10%&nbsp; for attorneys' fees, 10%&nbsp; for liquidated damages,&nbsp; and for&nbsp; costs.</blockquote>"VI—That&nbsp; the foregoing promissory&nbsp; notes,&nbsp; Annexes 'C,&nbsp; 'D', 'E' and&nbsp; 'G' were executed and&nbsp; delivered&nbsp; by&nbsp; defendant&nbsp; "William Viilarruz&nbsp; to&nbsp; plaintiff Jose&nbsp; A.&nbsp; Arches&nbsp; long&nbsp; after&nbsp; the materials supplied&nbsp; were requisitioned for,&nbsp; delivered to, and used&nbsp; in the&nbsp; said Project PR-48&nbsp; (1), because&nbsp; the&nbsp; accounting&nbsp; of each group&nbsp; of deliveries was&nbsp; not made&nbsp; immediately after the&nbsp; delivery of materials supplied but one or more months thereafter, and that each promissory note&nbsp; represents&nbsp; two or more requisitionists&nbsp; and deliveries&nbsp; to the said project;<br><br>"VII—That on February&nbsp; 10, 1951,&nbsp; for the purpose of collecting any&nbsp; amount due, at that&nbsp; time, to&nbsp;&nbsp; defendant Villarruz, plaintiff Jose A. Arches filed a&nbsp; claim, for&nbsp;&nbsp; materials&nbsp; supplied,&nbsp; with the Director of Public Works in the amount of P12,000 vhieh was the rough estimate&nbsp; of what&nbsp; was then&nbsp; owing from defendant Villarruz to&nbsp; plaintiff J ose A. Arches&nbsp; pending&nbsp; a definite accounting of the same for the values&nbsp; of&nbsp; materials supplied.&nbsp; A true copy of said claim for&nbsp; P12,000,&nbsp; made&nbsp; and attached as&nbsp; Annex 'B' of the com- plaint,&nbsp; is made an integral part&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; Amended&nbsp; Complaint&nbsp; as Annex 'B'."</blockquote>After&nbsp; hearing,&nbsp; the&nbsp; motion&nbsp; for&nbsp; reconsideration&nbsp; was denied, for not being well taken,&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; amended com- plaint rejected on&nbsp; the ground that it changed completely the action&nbsp; averred by the plaintiff in&nbsp; the original&nbsp; complaint by adopting a&nbsp; completely&nbsp; new&nbsp; theory&nbsp; on the&nbsp; case. The lower court, however, modified the&nbsp; order of dismissal by authorizing the plaintiff to file a separate action against William Villarruz&nbsp; for the&nbsp; collection of the&nbsp; promissory notes mentioned in&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon,&nbsp; plaintiff perfected his&nbsp; record&nbsp; on&nbsp; appeal&nbsp;&nbsp; and brought&nbsp; the case&nbsp; to this Court&nbsp; on the&nbsp; ground that the lower court&nbsp; erred—<br><blockquote><ol><li> In finding that&nbsp; it&nbsp; was money,&nbsp; and not labor and materials, that was supplied by the plaintiff-appellant to contractor William Villarruz in connection with,&nbsp; the supply of labor and materials used in the construction&nbsp; of the Ivisan Bridge and Approaches, Project Wo. 48&nbsp; (1).<br><br></li><li> Assuming&nbsp; arguendo, without&nbsp; however&nbsp; admitting, that it was rather money that was&nbsp; supplied by the plaintiff-appellant to con- tractor&nbsp; William&nbsp; Villarruz, the&nbsp; court&nbsp; a quo erred in arriving&nbsp; at the&nbsp; conclusion that the&nbsp; present claims of the&nbsp; plaintiff-appellant for&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment&nbsp; of&nbsp; such&nbsp; sums&nbsp; so&nbsp;&nbsp; advanced&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; covered and authorized&nbsp; by and&nbsp; under the provisions of&nbsp; Act 3688, and cannot&nbsp; therefore be&nbsp; assessed against the&nbsp; surety bond&nbsp; filed by the&nbsp; defendants-appellees&nbsp; pursuant to such&nbsp; construction&nbsp; Project and Act.<br><br></li><li> In&nbsp; arriving at the conclusion that the amended&nbsp; complaint changes&nbsp; the&nbsp; theory of&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; is&nbsp; made&nbsp; to avoid the ejects of the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; this court wherein&nbsp; we&nbsp; stated&nbsp; that the claim is&nbsp; for certain amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; money&nbsp; and&nbsp; not for&nbsp; materials', and&nbsp; 'that&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff&nbsp; is&nbsp; exerting&nbsp; efforts to change the nature of the averments of his original complaint but the evidence supporting the claims is the same as the original, that is, the collection of promissory&nbsp; notes representing&nbsp; amounts of&nbsp; money advanced to the defendant,<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; In dismissing&nbsp; the&nbsp; complaint,&nbsp; in disallowing the amended com- plaint, and in not holding a trial on&nbsp; the merits to give opportunity to the plaintiff-appellant to&nbsp; prove that he supplied materials, as he claims, to&nbsp; contractor William Villarruz&nbsp; in the construction of the Ivisan Bridge and Approaches.<br><br></li><li>&nbsp; In arriving at the conclusion that the complaint should have been brought in&nbsp; the name&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Government&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Philippines as party plaintiff."<br><br>Upon&nbsp;&nbsp; careful&nbsp; examination&nbsp; of the briefs filed&nbsp; by the parties, we find&nbsp; that the decisive&nbsp; question is reduced&nbsp; to whether&nbsp; or not the&nbsp; order of dismissal&nbsp; of the case&nbsp; and the denial of the&nbsp; motion for the&nbsp; admission of the amended complaint were erroneous.</li></ol></blockquote>With regard&nbsp; to defendant Villarruz, we find no justification for the dismissal of the case against him for, in his answer, he admitted having signed the promissory notes mentioned&nbsp; in the complaint though he claims that&nbsp; said promissory notes&nbsp; represent loans with&nbsp; usurious interest, and he failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; deny&nbsp; plaintiff's&nbsp; allegation&nbsp; that&nbsp; he did not&nbsp; pay&nbsp; for&nbsp; them.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; view&nbsp; of this answer, the lower court could not legally&nbsp; dismiss&nbsp; the case without&nbsp; hearing and presentation&nbsp; of evidence by&nbsp; the&nbsp; parties; it&nbsp; should have proceeded on with its trial in accordance with&nbsp; law.&nbsp; And&nbsp; because of&nbsp; that answer, the&nbsp; lower court&nbsp; was not even&nbsp; justified in&nbsp; ordering&nbsp; the plaintiff&nbsp; to file a separate and&nbsp; new complaint&nbsp; for&nbsp; it&nbsp; will&nbsp; necessarily&nbsp; entail&nbsp; new expenses&nbsp; for docketing&nbsp; and service&nbsp; of&nbsp; summons as&nbsp; well as&nbsp; require the&nbsp; plaintiff to&nbsp; rewrite the complaint,&nbsp; all&nbsp; of which could&nbsp; have been&nbsp; avoided by&nbsp; proceeding with the trial of the case, the parties concerned having joined issues thereon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently,&nbsp; the order&nbsp; of&nbsp; dismissal&nbsp; with&nbsp; regard to defendant Villarruz,&nbsp; runs counter to the spirit of the Rules of&nbsp;&nbsp; Court&nbsp; which&nbsp; should be&nbsp; liberally&nbsp; construed&nbsp; in it order to assist the parties in obtaining speedy and in&nbsp; expensive determination of any action or proceeding filed in court.<br><br>With&nbsp; regard to the&nbsp; order denying&nbsp; the admission of the&nbsp; amended&nbsp; complaint, we find it&nbsp; also&nbsp; erroneous for, under Rule 17, "the court may, at any stage of an&nbsp; action, permit a party to amend&nbsp; any pleading, to the end that the&nbsp; real&nbsp; matter in dispute and all matters in the&nbsp; action in&nbsp; dispute&nbsp; between the parties&nbsp; may, as far&nbsp; as&nbsp; possible, be completely determined&nbsp; in a&nbsp; <i>single&nbsp; proceeding</i>"; and altho, under this&nbsp; rule, it was discretionary for the court to refuse or grant the&nbsp; leave for the amendments&nbsp; sought&nbsp; for, yet, in the present case, we find that such judicial discretion should&nbsp; have&nbsp; been exercised favorably, so that the&nbsp; true dispute&nbsp; between the parties may be completely terminated in a single proceeding.&nbsp; The lower court denied the&nbsp; admission of the amended complaint&nbsp; on the ground that the plaintiff therein has changed the action&nbsp; alleged in the original complaint, but upon comparing the two complaints, we find that, essentially, there was no&nbsp; change of action for,&nbsp; in&nbsp; both the original and the amended complaints, the action was for the&nbsp; collection of&nbsp; tha value of the&nbsp; same&nbsp; promissory notes&nbsp; and the&nbsp; only&nbsp; difference between the original&nbsp; and the amended complaints is with regard to the&nbsp; consideration of said promissory notes, for while in the original complaint it was&nbsp; alleged that these were executed by defendant&nbsp; Villarruz for money obtained from plaintiff&nbsp; Arches&nbsp; and with which&nbsp; the former paid for labor&nbsp; and materials for the construction&nbsp; and&nbsp; completion&nbsp; of&nbsp; the Ivisan Bridge,&nbsp; in the amended complaint it was&nbsp; alleged that&nbsp; said promissory&nbsp; notes were executed for materials&nbsp; supplied&nbsp; to&nbsp; William Villarruz and actually used&nbsp; in the&nbsp; construction of the&nbsp; Ivisan&nbsp; Bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the rule allowing amendments to a pleading&nbsp; is&nbsp; subject to the general limitation that the cause of action should not be&nbsp; substantially&nbsp; changed or that the theory&nbsp; of the case should not be altered, in the furtherance of&nbsp; justice, amendments to a pleading should be favored&nbsp; and the rules thereon should be liberally construed.&nbsp; In the present case, we find&nbsp; justification for&nbsp; allowing the&nbsp; admission of the amended complaint in order that the real question between the parties may be properly&nbsp; and justly threshed out,&nbsp; in a single proceeding, and thus avoid multiplicity of actions.<br><br>Wherefore,&nbsp; the&nbsp; orders&nbsp; appealed&nbsp; from are&nbsp; hereby&nbsp; set aside and the ease remanded to the lower court for further proceedings upon previous admission of the amended com- plaint and the filing of the corresponding answers thereof by the defendants, without costs.<br><br><i>Paras,&nbsp;
