<p>Upon the foregoing stipulation the Court rendered judgment dismissing the complaint with costs.</p>
<p>After  denial of  their motion for reconsideration  and new trial the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>
<p>The instrument  of sale in favor  of  Anastacia Y.  de Espanola of the parcel of land  with a reservation of the right to repurchase  it was executed on 18 April  1926 by five of the eight plaintiffs who had inherited the parcel of land from their late mother Carmen Nacionales (Exhibit A).   There was no stipulation as to term within which the vendors  could  repurchase it.  On 27  October  1927 the parcel of land  was  repurchased  from  Anastacia Y.  de Espanola with  money secured or borrowed from Timoteo Pagharion  and after the repurchase  the possession of the parcel of land was turned over to the latter who  since then have been in possession thereof.  Whether the transfer of possession of the parcel of land was in the nature of an assignment of the right of Anastacio Y. de Española, the former vendee,  as may be implied from the turning over or delivery to the defendant of the instrument of sale (Exhibit A)  and the possession of the parcel of land sold, or a new contract of sale with the reservation of the right to repurchase the parcel of land without term, the period of four years fixed by law within which the vendors may repurchase it<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> already had expired.  Three of the plaintiffs who did not  execute the instrument  of  sale  do  not pretend that they did not authorize the other  five co-heirs to execute it for them.  The plaintiffs rest their case on their  right they  claim they  have to repurchase the  parcel  of  land. But the defendant's possession of the parcel of land  from 27  October 1927, when he took possession  thereof,  to 7 December 1949, when the complaint was filed in this case, 22 years, 1 month and 11 days had already elapsed, which is a period of  time sufficient not  only  to bar the action but to vest in him title by prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [2]</sup><br>
</p>
<p>The judgment appealed  from is affirmed,  with  costs against the appellants.</p>
