				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This appeal&nbsp; is taken from&nbsp; a decision of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Court of First&nbsp; Instance&nbsp; of&nbsp; Manila denying recovery of&nbsp; P1,267.75 paid as compensating tax on the value of business machines imported into the Philippines by the appellant International Business Machines&nbsp; Corporation&nbsp; from&nbsp; July 1, 1939 up to, and including March 31, 1941, and then rented (not sold) to its&nbsp; customers.<br><br>The facts, as stipulated, are:<br><blockquote>"During the period&nbsp; from July 1, 1939 up to and including March 31,&nbsp; 1941, the&nbsp; period embraced in&nbsp; the complaint, the plaintiff-appellant had engaged in&nbsp; the business&nbsp; of selling&nbsp; machine&nbsp; cards&nbsp; and leasing&nbsp; business&nbsp; machines. The machine&nbsp; cards&nbsp; were&nbsp; sold&nbsp; and the&nbsp; business machine&nbsp; leased' to the customers of plaintiff-appellant. The&nbsp; sales tax&nbsp; of 3½ percent, which was the rate&nbsp; in&nbsp; force during&nbsp; the period in&nbsp; question, was paid on the sales of machine cards.&nbsp; Defendant-appellee demanded and collected from plaintiff-appellant, and the latter paid, the amount of Pl,267.75 representing the&nbsp; alleged compensating1 tax on&nbsp; the&nbsp; business machines brought by plaintiff-appellant into&nbsp; the Philippines and used as above&nbsp; stated.<br><br>Of the sum of Pl.267.75,&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount of P828.10 was the compensating tax on machines&nbsp; imported&nbsp; by plaintiff&nbsp; from July 1, 1959 to&nbsp; October&nbsp; 15,&nbsp; 1940, inclusive,&nbsp; and the balance&nbsp; of&nbsp; P469.4E was the&nbsp; compensating tax on the machines imported by plaintiff- appellant during the&nbsp; period&nbsp; from October 16, 1940 up&nbsp; to&nbsp; March 31,&nbsp; 1941.<br><br>Appellant filed a claim with the appellee in the total amount of P1,267.75 within the period of 2 years from the date of&nbsp; payment thereof,&nbsp; and the latter denied said claim."&nbsp; (Brief for Appellant, pp.&nbsp; 2-3.)</blockquote>The gist of appellant's position&nbsp; is that the compensating taxes&nbsp; collected&nbsp; during&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; under&nbsp;&nbsp; the original sec. 190 of the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Internal Revenue Code, before&nbsp; the&nbsp; same was approved by&nbsp; the President of&nbsp; the United States, were in&nbsp; fact a tax on imports,&nbsp; and could not become law without the Presidential approval, provided in&nbsp; section&nbsp; 2(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>),&nbsp; paragraph&nbsp; 9,&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Philippine Independence Act&nbsp;&nbsp; (Act&nbsp; of&nbsp; Congress&nbsp; of&nbsp; March 24 1934), reproduced&nbsp; in section 1(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) of the Ordinance appended to the&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; Constitution.<br><br>The text of section 190 aforesaid,&nbsp; before its amendment by Commonwealth Act&nbsp; No. .503, is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Sec.&nbsp; 190.&nbsp; <i>Compensating&nbsp; tax</i>.—All persons purchasing or receiving from without the Philippines&nbsp; any commodities, goods, .wares, or&nbsp; merchandise,&nbsp; excepting&nbsp; those subject&nbsp; to specific taxes&nbsp; under Title IV of this&nbsp; Code, shall pay on the total value thereof at&nbsp; the time they are received by such persons, including&nbsp; freight, postage, insurance, commission, and all similar charges,&nbsp; a&nbsp; compensating tax equivalent to the percentage&nbsp; tax&nbsp; imposed under&nbsp; this&nbsp; Title on original&nbsp; transactions effected&nbsp; by merchants, importers,&nbsp; or manufacturers, such&nbsp; tax to be&nbsp; paid upon&nbsp; the withdrawal or removal of said commodities, goods, wares, or merchandise from the&nbsp; customhouse or&nbsp; the&nbsp; post office:&nbsp; Provided, however,&nbsp; That merchants, importers, and manufacturers,&nbsp; who are subject to tax under sections 184, 185, 186,&nbsp; 187&nbsp; and 189&nbsp; of this&nbsp; Title&nbsp; shall&nbsp; not&nbsp; be required to&nbsp; pay .the&nbsp; tax herein&nbsp; Imposed where the articles purchased or received&nbsp; by&nbsp; them from&nbsp; without the Philippines are to&nbsp; be resold, bartered, or exchanged, or used in connection with their business." (National Internal Revenue Code)&nbsp;&nbsp; (Brief for.&nbsp; Appellant, pp.&nbsp; 3-4.)<br></blockquote>We&nbsp; agree with the&nbsp; decision of the Court below&nbsp; that the compensating&nbsp; tax thus imposed is not&nbsp; a tax on the importation of goods.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is evident&nbsp; from the proviso that imported merchandise which is to be&nbsp; disposed or in transactions subject to&nbsp; sales tax&nbsp; under sections&nbsp; 184,&nbsp; 185, 186, 187 and&nbsp; 189&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Internal&nbsp; Revenue&nbsp; Code, is&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; exempted from&nbsp; the compensating tax.&nbsp; This feature&nbsp; shows that it is not&nbsp; the act of&nbsp; importation that is taxed under section 190, but the use of imported goods not subjected to a&nbsp; sale&nbsp; tax; otherwise the,compensating tax would&nbsp; have been&nbsp; levied on all&nbsp; imported goods regardless&nbsp; of&nbsp; any&nbsp; subsequent tax&nbsp; that&nbsp; might&nbsp; accrue. Moreover,&nbsp; the compensating tax&nbsp; accrues&nbsp; whether or not the imported&nbsp; goods are subject to pay customs duties.<br><br>&nbsp;That&nbsp; the compensating tax was&nbsp; expressly&nbsp; designed&nbsp; as a&nbsp; substitute to make up&nbsp; or&nbsp; compensate for the revenue lost to&nbsp; the government .through the&nbsp; avoidance of sales&nbsp; taxes by means of direct&nbsp; purchases abroad&nbsp; is&nbsp; shown&nbsp; by&nbsp; the report of the Tax&nbsp; Commission that prepared the Internal Revenue Code.<br><blockquote>"3.&nbsp; <i>Compensating tax&nbsp; imposed.</i>—Avoidance of&nbsp; sales tax is to be prevented- by imposing&nbsp; a&nbsp; compensating&nbsp; tax of&nbsp; 1½ per cent on all&nbsp; persons other&nbsp; than merchants, manufacturers etc., who receive goods directly from abroad.<br><br>It is proposed to levy upon all&nbsp; persons who purchase or receive directly from abroad commodities goods,&nbsp; wares and merchandise; except those&nbsp; subject to&nbsp; specific taxes&nbsp; urider the&nbsp; propose plan, a tax equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; the percentage tax imposed&nbsp; on&nbsp; original sales, barters, or&nbsp; exchanges of&nbsp; similar articles&nbsp; effected&nbsp; by merchants, importers, or manufacturers.&nbsp; The tax will&nbsp; be based on the total value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; articles at&nbsp; the&nbsp; time they are&nbsp; received,&nbsp; including freight, postage, insurance,&nbsp; commission and&nbsp; all other charges, and it&nbsp; will be paid&nbsp; before the articles are actually&nbsp; removed from the customhouse&nbsp; or&nbsp; post-office.&nbsp; . However,&nbsp; merchants, importers, and manufacturers will&nbsp; not&nbsp; be required&nbsp; to&nbsp; pay&nbsp; this tax&nbsp; where the articles purchased or received by them from without&nbsp; the Philippines are intended for&nbsp; resale, barter, or exchange, or for use in corinection1 with their business and&nbsp; are&nbsp; actually disposed&nbsp; of so used.&nbsp; Furthermore, the tax will&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; assessed or collected on any. single shipment consigned to&nbsp; any one person when the total value of&nbsp; the&nbsp; shipment does not exceed. P100.<br><br>&nbsp;The&nbsp; purpose&nbsp; of this. proposal&nbsp; is to place persons purchasing goods from dealers doing&nbsp; business in the&nbsp; Philippines&nbsp; in&nbsp; equal footing, for tax purposes, with those who purchase goods directly from without the&nbsp; Philippines.&nbsp; Under the present law,&nbsp; the former bear the burden of the local sales&nbsp; tax because,' it is shift them as part of the selling' price&nbsp; demanded by the local merchant while the latter do not.&nbsp; The proposed tax will&nbsp; do&nbsp; away with this inequility and render&nbsp; justice to merchants and&nbsp; firms of&nbsp; all&nbsp; nationalities "who arc in legitimate business here, paying taxes&nbsp; and giving employment&nbsp; to a large number of people."&nbsp; (Report of the Tax Commission&nbsp; of the&nbsp; Philippines,&nbsp; Vol. I, pp.&nbsp; 74-75.)&nbsp;&nbsp; (Brief&nbsp; for Appellee, pp. 4-6.)<br></blockquote>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; argued for&nbsp; appellant that the compensating tax is imposed on imported merchandise&nbsp; irrespective of uses to which it is to&nbsp; be subsequently devoted, and that such feature&nbsp; makes&nbsp; it&nbsp; an import tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; The premise&nbsp; is&nbsp; incorrect: for, as previously observed, if the. goods are actually sold within the Philippines,. they&nbsp; are exempt from the compensating tax.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter thus becomes&nbsp; arax on use of goods other&nbsp; than the sale thereof.<br><br>Calling it an&nbsp; import tax will not make&nbsp; it one.&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted by the U. S. Supreme Court in Henneford <i>vs.</i> Silas Mason Co.,&nbsp; 300 U. S.&nbsp; 577,&nbsp; 81 L.&nbsp; Ed., 814, on pages&nbsp; 820-821, <i>a propos</i>&nbsp; of a similar&nbsp; tax imposed by the state of Washington-<br><blockquote>"Catchwords and labels, such as the words 'protective tariff'&nbsp; are subject to the dangers that&nbsp; lurk in metaphors and symbols, and must be watched with circumspection lest they put us of,&nbsp; our guard. A tariff,&nbsp; whether protective or for revenue, burdens the .very&nbsp; act of importation, and&nbsp; if&nbsp; laid&nbsp; by a state&nbsp; upon&nbsp; its&nbsp; commerce with another is equally unlawful whether protection or&nbsp; revenue is&nbsp; the motive back&nbsp; ol it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But a tax upon&nbsp; use,&nbsp; or,&nbsp; what is&nbsp; equivalent for present'&nbsp; purposes,&nbsp; a tax&nbsp; upon&nbsp; property after&nbsp; importation&nbsp; is over, 'is&nbsp; not&nbsp; a clog&nbsp; upon the&nbsp; process of importation at all, any more than a tax upon the income or profits of a business."<br></blockquote>Not being an&nbsp; import&nbsp; tax,&nbsp; we&nbsp; hold the&nbsp; compensating tax under&nbsp; section 190&nbsp; of the Internal Revenue Code to have&nbsp; been&nbsp; validly imposed&nbsp; by the&nbsp; Commonwealth&nbsp; without the previous approval of the President of&nbsp; the United States.<br><br>The decision&nbsp; appealed from is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Parás, C. J., Padilla, Montemayor, Reyes, A., Jugo, Bautista&nbsp; Angelo, Labrador,&nbsp; Concepcion,</i>&nbsp; and <i>Endeiicia, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
