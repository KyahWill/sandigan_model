				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review of the decision  of the Court of Appeals affirming  that of the Court of First Instance of  Samar. <br><br>For purposes of reference,  we reproduce the  pertinent portions  of the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals which narrate the facts  and issues involved and state the reasons of said appellate court  in  affirming in <span style="font-style: italic;">toto</span> the judgment of the trial court: <br><blockquote>"This is an appeal filed  by  the plaintiffs  against the decision rendered on September 5, 1953 by the Court of First Instance of Samar, the dispositive part  of which reads as follows:<br><br>'In view of the foregoing, the Court renders judgment requiring the plaintiffs Alipio N. Casilan  and Purita Galanara  to pay, jointly and severally, to the defendant Raymond  Tomasi  indemnity and damages in the sum of P8,325; to the defendants Santiago Gancayco and Manuel Gancayco  attorney's  fees and expenses of  litigation in the sum of P700; and to defendant Manuel  Gancayco  damages in the sum of P210, with legal interest on all  said sums; and to pay the costs  of  this action.'"</blockquote>After enumerating the errors  assigned by plaintiffs-appellants (petitioners herein), the  Court of Appeals continued: <br><blockquote>"From  the foregoing  assignment  of  errors,  it appears clearly that  there is no  issue as  to the  probative  value of the evidence submitted by  the defendants and appellees.  The question  to be resolved in this appeal is whether the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a  quo</span>  was correct in denying the plaintiffs' last  petition for postponement of  the trial in  this  case, and in dismissing the  plaintiffs'  complaint, and in condemning said  plaintiffs to  pay damages and  costs  to the defendants and appellees. <br><br>"It appears  from the record  that there is no  dispute  on the following facts:  On February 13, 1950, the  plaintiffs  and appellants riled their complaint against the defendants and appellees,  praying: (1) that  after previous filing of a  bond, a writ  of preliminary injunction be issued ordering the defendants, their attorneys, agents and other persons who act in their name to desist from dismantling and removing  certain "munition depositary huts";  (2) that  the plaintiffs  be declared the  owners  of  39 munition  quonset  huts situated within the Naval Base, Lot 1, Barrio Carapdapan, Salcedo, Samar; and  (3)  that  the defendants be ordered to pay, jointly and severally,  to the plaintiffs  the amount  of P3,000  as  damages  plus the costs.  On  February 17, 1950, an order of preliminary injunction against  the  defendants  was  issued; and on March 4, 1950, the court approved a counterbond and dissolved the preliminary injunction.  On  April  14,  1950,  the plaintiffs and  appellants  filed an amended  complaint  in which they  prayed that  the  defendant be ordered to pay them  the  amount of P23,400 as  damages plus  the costs.  On July 29, 1950, the court  rendered  its decision in favor of the defendant Raymond Tomasi, declaring  him the lawful owner of  the  ammunition  huts in question;  and ordering  the plaintiffs Alipio N. Casilan and  Purita Galanara to pay, jointly andl severally, to the defendant Raymond Tomasi,  indemnity and damages in  the amount of P9,033 plus legal interest; and to  both defendants,  the costs of  the action.  The  plaintiff  appealed  from  said decision, and the Court of Appeals set aside the  same and  remanded  this case to the court of origin for new trial.   In that first decision, it is stated  that  the complaint was  dismissed  for failure  of  the plaintiffs  to  prosecute. <br><br>"It is also beyond dispute that after  this case was remanded to the Court of First Instance of Samar, this case was set for hearing on  July 23,  1953  (should  be July 29, 1953), and  the necessary notifications were issued.  On July 23, 1953,  upon petition of both parties  contained in a telegram, the trial  of the case was  set  for August 26, 1953.  However, when the case was called for hearing on that date, plaintiffs' counsel moved for the postponement of  the trial on the ground that one of his witnesses, Mr.  Alfredo Eugenio, was sent to Indonesia by the Philippine government and that another witness,  Mrs.  Mercedes T.  Casilan,  could not be present  due to physical inability to travel.  The petition was opposed by  defendants' counsel who came from Tacloban City and Manila  and whose witnesses came from other provinces.  The court denied the petition for postponement of the trial and announced  that the trial would proceed, but counsel for the plaintiffs left the session hall and could not be found when the court ordered the commencement of the trial, so the plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed and  the court proceeded to  receive the  evidence of the  defendants  in  support of  their counterclaim. <br><br>"In its decision,  the  court a  quo stated  that  the  reason  for the denial  of the  petition  for postponement of the  hearing filed by plaintiffs' counsel was that neither said petition nor the information verbally  given  by said  plaintiffs'  counsel showed that the evidence intended  to  be  adduced through the testimony of Mr.  Eugenio and Mrs. Casilan,  could not be adduced by the presentation  of some other witnesses.  We examined carefully the record of  this  case and  we  did not find any  manifestation  of plaintiffs'  counsel  that there were  no  other witnesses who might  establish  the facts  that Mr.  Eugenio and  Mrs. Casilan would  have testified on.  For this reason, there is no reasonable  ground  to  disagree with  the court a quo  on its  reason  for  denying the petition  of postponement presented by plaintiffs'  counsel.<br><br>"We believe that under the facts mentioned above,  the trial court did not act in grave abuse of its discretion  in denying the aforesaid petition for postponement of the trial presented by plaintiffs' counsel. Furthermore, the plaintiffs' counsel did not state under oath in his motion for the postponement of the trial, the nature and materiality of the evidence expected  to be obtained  from Mr. Eugenio  and Mrs. Casilan.   It is necessary to  so  state  in  such  a  motion  for postponement of the trial.  (Section 5,  Rule  31 of the  Rules of Court).   Besides, plaintiffs'  counsel did not  state in an affidavit  that Mrs.  Casilan's presence  at  the trial was indispensable and that her illness is  of such a nature as to render her non-attendance excusable (Section  5,  Rule  31 of the Rules  of  Court).   Lastly, there is tio evidence  that plaintiffs'  counsel  exerted  efforts  to procure  the attendance of these two witnesses, Mr.  Eugenio and  Mrs. Casilan."</blockquote>The  Court of Appeals finally disposed of the  case in  the following paragraphs:<br><blockquote>"In the light  of the foregoing considerations, we declare that the denial of  the petition for the postponement  of the trial  was proper and  the court a quo did  not  commit  any  error in dismissing the plaintiffs'  complaint for failure to prosecute their case. <br><br>"The plaintiffs  not having questioned the decision of the court a  quo as  to the merits of the defendants' counterclaim,  we  are constrained to concur with said court's conclusion  regarding  the same. <br><br>"Premises  considered,  the decision  appealed from  is  hereby affirmed in  toto without  costs."</blockquote>The  issue involved in  the present appeal  is whether or not the  trial court abused  its discretion  in denying petitioners' motion for postponement, and in allowing respondents to  amend their answer  to conform to the evidence presented and whether the Court of Appeals erred in confirming said action of the trial court. <br><br>The rule is well settled that motions for postponement are addressed to the sound  discretion  of the court,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> and this discretion  would not  be interfered  with  unless it has been clearly abused.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</span></sup>  In the case of U.S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ramirez, 39 Phil,  738, 742,  this  Court held: <br><blockquote>"The ruling of the court will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.  When the discretion of the court is exercised  with  a reasonable degree of judicial acumen  and fairness,  it is one which the higher court is loathe to review or to disturb.  The trial judge must be to a certain extent free to secure speedy and expeditious trials when such speed and expedition are not inconsistent with fairness.  Since the court trying  the case is, from personal observation, familiar with all the attendant circumstances, and has the best opportunity of forming a correct opinion upon the  case presented, the presumption  will be in favor of  its action.  It would  take  an extreme case of abuse of discretion to make the action of the trial court a denial of due process of law."</blockquote> In connection with the transfer of the hearing  to August 26,1953, by virtue of a request for postponement contained in a telegram  signed by counsel for both parties, three days  before  the scheduled  hearing  on  August 26, 1953, counsel  for  petitioners  by  telegram requested  the trial court that the hearing of the case be postponed  to October 21,  1953, on the ground  that an amicable settlement was going on.  The following day, the Clerk of Court informed petitioners' counsel  by telegram  that the  Judge was  not agreeable to the requested  postponement.  On the day of the hearing, August 26, 1953, counsel for  petitioners  submitted a written  motion for postponement on  the ground that his witnesses were absent, one  of them, Alfredo Eugenio, being in  Indonesia as a  Government representative, and the  other,  Mercedes  T. Casilan, was ill.  The  trial court  denied the  motion on the ground that  it  was  not shown there were no other witnesses by whom petitioners could  prove the  facts sought to  be  obtained from  said absent witnesses, and that  with respect to Mercedes  Casilan,  there was no  showing that  her testimony was material  to the  determination of the  case.  We reproduce Sections  5  and  6  of  Rule 31 of the Rules  of  Court, which we find pertinent  and applicable:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Requisites of motion to postpone trial for absence of evidence</span>.—A motion  to postpone a trial on the ground of  absence of evidence can be granted only upon affidavit showing the materiality of evidence expected to  be obtained, and that due diligence has been used to procure  it.  But  if the adverse party admits that such evidence would be given, and that it be considered as actually given on  the trial, or offered  and overruled  as  improper, the trial  must not be  postponed. <br><br>"SEC. 6. Requisites of motion to postpone trial for illness of party.—A motion  to postpone a  trial on the  ground of illness  of a party may be granted  if  it appears  upon affidavit that the presence of such party at the trial is indispensable and that the character of his illness is such as to render his nonattendance excusable."</blockquote>In the case of U. S. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Ramirez, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, it was held that: <br><blockquote>"Three things are necessary  to put off  a trial on account of the absence of a witness:   First, that the witness  is  really material and appears to the court to be so; second,  that  the  party  who applies has  been  guilty of no neglect;  and third, that the witness can be held at the time to which the trial has been deferred,  and, incidentally, that  no  similar evidence could be obtained."</blockquote>The above  ruling finds support in American authorities:<br><blockquote>"The affidavit should  contain a statement that the facts to which it is claimed the  absent witness would testify cannot  be  proved by any other witnesses who are available, or by the exercise of diligence,  could have been  made available to the applicant at the trial. It has been held to be insufficient to state merely that the party has no other witnesses,  or that there are no other witnesses  in attendance or in the state. Further, an allegation that there is no other witness whose testimony can be so readily procured  has been held to be insufficient."  (17 C.J.S. 263).</blockquote> With reference to the absence of witness Alfredo Eugenio cited by subpoena <span style="font-style: italic;">duces tecum</span> to appear and to bring with him a copy of the resolution of the Surplus Liquidating Committee, dated May 5, 1950, regarding the 39 quon set huts, subject matter of the controversy, upon receiving said subpoena,  Alfredo Eugenio addressed a letter to the Board of Liquidators, the pertinent portion of which reads: <br><blockquote>"In view of the fact that the Surplus Property Liquidating Committee has already been abolished, and it was replaced by the Board of Liquidators of which I am not a member, I would like to recommend  that  a representative  of the  Board  of  Liquidators be sent with pertinent papers  to Catbalogan, Samar,  to  represent the plaintiff at the hearing of this  case."  (Record  on Appeal, p. 75). </blockquote>From the above, it is apparent that in the place of Alfredo Eugenio, someone else,  say, a representative of the Board of Liquidators,  could have been subpoenaed to bring with him the  resolution of the Surplus Liquidating Committee and  other papers necessary,  and perhaps testify  on the same.  In  other words,  the petitioners had every opportunity to procure another or other witnesses  in the place of Alfredo Eugenio. With respect to witness Mercedes Casilan, we find no reason for disturbing the finding and ruling of the Court of Appeals that petitioners failed to  state in an affidavit that the illness of the witness  was of such a nature as to render her nonattendance excusable and her  presence at the trial indispensable,  as required by Section 6, Rule 31, of the Rules of Court. <br><br>With respect to the  contention  of petitioners that the Court  of Appeals  erred in affirming that part  of the lower court decision granting respondents leave to file an amended answer to conform  to the evidence presented by them, particularly, concerning expenses and losses  incurred by them, it will be  recalled  that after the trial court had denied petitioners' counsel's motion for postponement, said counsel walked out of the courtroom and was nowhere to be found, despite the ruling of the trial court that the trial would proceed.  It is clear that even in the absence of said counsel for petitioners, the respondents had  the right to prove their cause  of action in the counterclaim and amend their pleadings so as to conform  to the evidence submitted by them.<br><blockquote>"* * *. The appellant was at liberty, notwithstanding the withdrawal  of the respondents,  to go  on with its  case, and prove a cause of action against them, if  it could. If it  succeeded  in  its proofs, and the court should hold  its  complaint  defective, its right to amend would not  be affected by the absence of  the respondents; on the contrary, it could  amend its complaint to  correspond with its proofs and take judgment against them as if they were personally present."  (C.  C. Belknap Glass Co. <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Kelleher, et al., 130 Pac. 1123, 1124.)</blockquote>                                In  view  of the  foregoing, we  find no error in the appealed decision of the Court of Appeals, and so affirm the same, with costs.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C.
