				<H3>ANACLETA VILLAROMAN AND PEDRO VILLAROMAN, JR., PETITIONERS, VS. QUIRINO STA. MARIA AND HON. AGUSTIN P. MONTESA,  AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF NUEVA ECIJA, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FELIX, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pedro Villaroman, Jr., and Anacleta Villaroman, husband and wife, were  the defendants in a civil  case filed by Quirino  Sta. Maria  with the  Court of  First Instance of Nueva. Ecija (Civil Case No. 2141).   On July 16, 1956, the Court rendered judgment therein  finding the spouses Villaroman liable as charged and  ordered them to return the palay deposited by plaintiff  in their warehouse or pay the  value  thereof amounting to  P745.00,  with  legal interest  from the date of the filing of the action, plus the sum of P200.00 for damages and  attorney's fees, and for costs.  A  copy of  this  decision   was said  to  have been received by  defendants on <span style="font-style: italic;">July 19, 1956</span>.  On <span style="font-style: italic;">August 7, 1956</span>, or 19 days thereafter, defendants filed a  motion for reconsideration  of the  decision on the  ground that  the findings of the Court were contrary to law and the evidence adduced during the trial, with  additional prayer for leave to file a third party complaint, which motion was denied by the Court  in  its  order of August 16,  1956,  received by defendants on <span style="font-style: italic;">August 20 </span>of the same year.  The  prayer for leave to file a third party  complaint was also  denied for having been presented out  of time. <br><br>It appears from the record  that on  <span style="font-style: italic;">August 20, 1956</span>, plaintiff Sta.  Maria filed a motion for  execution  of  the decision of July 16, 1956, contending that same had already become final as no appeal was  taken therefrom, and  the Court,  despite the objection of defendants, granted  the same  and  issued on <span style="font-style: italic;">August 24,  1956</span>, a  writ of execution which was correspondingly registered with the Register of Deeds of Nueva Ecija on August 28, 1956.  This prompted the defendants to file on this later date separate motions seeking to set aside  the  order  of execution and for  the approval of the appeal bond and record on appeal, but the Court,  also in separate orders  dated  August  30, 1956, denied the first for lack of merit and the  second for having been filed  out of time. <br><br>From these orders, defendants filed with Us the  instant petition for  certiorari  which was given  due  course by resolution of this  Court of September 26,  1956, and upon petitioners'  filing  a  bond for  P200.00, the  preliminary injunction  enjoining the respondent Judge from enforcing his order of August 24, 1956, was  consequently  issued. Notwithstanding the summons sent in connection with this case,  We  find that respondents Quirino Sta. Maria  and the Judge of the  Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija did not file their respective answers to the petition.  Petitioners also failed to elaborate their stand by means of any memorandum.  In resolving, therefore, the  issue presented by this action, i.e., whether or not the lower Court acted properly in  ordering the  execution  of the decision of July 16, 1956, and in denying the approval of the appeal bond  and  record on appeal, We  have to  rely solely on  the facts  and  circumstances stated in the  petition. <br>  <br>It is a fundamental rule of procedure that the execution of a judgment or order shall issue only upon the  expiration of the period to appeal where no such appeal has been perfected (Section 1,  Rule 39,  Rules of Court) and the filing of  a motion for the reconsideration of such decision or order suspends the running of the period of its finality. <br><br>In  the case at bar, defendants  were notified  of the decision  on <span style="font-style: italic;">July  19, 1956</span>,  and the motion for the reconsideration  filed on  August  7  of the same year was presented 19  days after receipt  of said  decision.  Considering that  the order  denying  the  motion for  reconsideration was received by defendants on August 20, 1956, and that the  prescriptive period within which to  perfect an  appeal continued to run  again  only on  that date, We find that defendants had  11 days more  to perfect their appeal.   The  writ of  execution issued by the Court  on August 24,  1956, pursuant  to  the motion  of respondent Sta. Maria, who appeared to have been notified  of and furnished with  copy of said motion for reconsideration, was made 23  days after the  promulgation of the decision, that is, before the expiration of  the period that defendants had to appeal. <br><br>We looked  into the  possibility  that  the  motion for reconsideration might  have  been a <span style="font-style: italic;">pro forma</span> one  which would, thus  justify the Court's action, for such  kind of motion  will not suspend  the running of  the period to appeal.   But a reading of the same—delineating the facts relied upon by defendants  in  their desire  to  secure  a reconsideration  of the  decision—convinces  Us that it is not a mere <span style="font-style: italic;">pro  forma</span> pleading.   Moreover, there is  no such  allegation to that effect in the motion for execution filed  by the  plaintiff,  nor that was even mentioned in the order of  the  court denying the said  motion  for reconsideration. <br><br>We are also aware that there are instances where the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, may order the execution of a decision even  before the expiration  of the period to appeal,  but in  these cases the reason therefor must  be  specifically stated  in  the order (Section 2, Rule 39, Rules of  Court).  Nothing of this  sort, however, appears in  the  case at bar, and taking  into  account the circumstances surrounding the present action, there seems to be  no valid and special  reason that would justify the issuance by the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> of the writ of execution before the expiration  of  the  statutory period  to appeal and the disapproval of the appeal bond and record on appeal which We find to have been  filed  on  time. <br><br>Wherefore, the orders of  the Court of August 24, 1956, issuing the writ of execution, of August 30, 1956, denying the motion to annul said writ, and of August 30, 1956, denying the approval of the record on appeal  and  appeal bond,  are hereby set aside and  this case  is remanded to the lower court for further  proceedings.  The preliminary  injunction issued by this  Court is  hereby  made permanent.  Costs taxed against respondent Quirino Sta. Maria.  It is  so ordered. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Paras,  C. J., Bengzon, Padilla,  Montemayor, Reyes, A. Bautista Angelo, Labrador</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Endencia, JJ.,</span> concur. <br><br></div>
