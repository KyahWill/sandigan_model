				<H3>BENITO MONTINOLA,  PETITIONERS, VS. THE  HONORABLE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In&nbsp; connection with the elections held on November 8, 1955,&nbsp; the last day for filing certificates of&nbsp; candidacy was September 9.&nbsp; On September 8, the petitioner Benito Montinola filed his certificate of candidacy for mayor of Victorias, Negros Occidental, and on September 9, at 5:00 p.m., his certificate of candidacy for&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; board&nbsp; member of Negros&nbsp; Occidental.&nbsp; On&nbsp; September 10, at 9:40&nbsp; a.m., he sent a telegram to the respondent Commission on Elections, withdrawing his&nbsp; certificate&nbsp; of&nbsp; candidacy&nbsp; for&nbsp; provincial board member,&nbsp; stating&nbsp; that said&nbsp; certificate was&nbsp; filed by mistake; whereupon the respondent Commission&nbsp; sent a telegram to the petitioner requiring the latter to file with the provincial secretary of&nbsp; Negros&nbsp; Occidental a&nbsp; sworn statement of withdrawal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, on&nbsp; September&nbsp; 17, the petitioner filed with the provincial secretary&nbsp; the&nbsp; required affidavit.&nbsp; On October 18, the respondent Commission adopted a resolution declaring the petitioner ineligible for the office of mayor, on the ground that the withdrawal of his certificate of candidacy for provincial board member was not filed on or&nbsp; before&nbsp; September 9, with the result that the&nbsp; petitioner became ineligible not only for the office of provincial board member but also for the office of mayor, in accordance with section 31 of the Revised Election Code , which provides&nbsp; that&nbsp; "No person&nbsp; shall be eligible unless, within the time fixed by law,&nbsp; he filed a duly signed and sworn certificate of&nbsp; candidacy, nor&nbsp; shall any person be eligible for more than one&nbsp; office to be filled&nbsp; in the&nbsp; same election, and, if he files certificates of candidacy for&nbsp; more than&nbsp; one office, he shall not be eligible for any of them." On October 25, the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the respondent Commission in its resolution of the same day.&nbsp; Whereupon, on October 26, the present petition&nbsp; for certiorari&nbsp; with preliminary mandatory injunction was filed in this Court. As prayed for in the&nbsp; petition, a writ&nbsp; of preliminary injunction was issued on October 29, ordering&nbsp; the respondent Commission to count and consider the votes cast in favor of the petitioner during the elections of November 8. The respondent Commission duly filed&nbsp; an&nbsp; answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mateo Garganera,&nbsp; a duly registered candidate for the office of mayor of Victorias, Negros Occidental, filed a petition for intervention and for preliminary injunction to suspend the proclamation of the winning&nbsp; candidate for&nbsp; the&nbsp; office of the mayor of Victorias.&nbsp; Iritervenor Garganera adopted the answer filed by the respondent Commission. This Court in its resolution of November 18,&nbsp; admitted the petition for intervention but resolved to maintain the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction&nbsp; already issued.<br><br>The hearing was set for November 28, but none of the parties orally argued.&nbsp; Instead intervenor Garganera filed a memorandum in lieu of oral argument, and the petitioner filed a reply memorandum.<br><br>While section 31 of the Revised Election Code is definite in requiring the filing of a certificate of candidacy within the statutory&nbsp; period, and in&nbsp; providing that, if one files certificates of candidacy for more than one office, he&nbsp; shall not be eligible for any of them, neither&nbsp; said&nbsp; section nor any other section provides that the withdrawal of a certificate should be made on or before the last day for filing the same.&nbsp; We hold&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner's withdrawal of his certificate of candidacy for provincial board member&nbsp; on September 10, was effective for all legal purposes, and left in full force Ma certificate of candidacy&nbsp; for&nbsp; mayor.&nbsp; We have already had occasion to rule that there&nbsp; is no&nbsp; provision of law forbidding withdrawal of candidacy at any time before the election (Clutario <span style="font-style: italic;">vs.</span> Commission on Elections, G. E. No. L-1704, resolution of November 5, 1947).<br><br>The respondent Commission and intervenor Mated Garganera have cited the example of a candidate who may file certificates of candidacy for all the elective office within the statutory period, and&nbsp; subsequently withdraw all certificates of candidacy except one on the eve of the election; and they imagine the confusion to be confronted by the electorate if petitioner's&nbsp; theory is sustained.&nbsp; Assuming that there would be such confusion, we are not prepared to say that a prohibition against withdrawal of candidacy should be read into&nbsp; the law merely on that account.&nbsp;&nbsp; At any rate, the ease before us is very far from the example given.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, petitioner's situation has&nbsp; all the earmarks or good faith and promptness, because no&nbsp; sooner had he filed his certificate of candidacy for provincial board member on September 9,&nbsp; at 5:00 p.m.,&nbsp; then he&nbsp; withdrew said certificate the next day, at 6:40 a.m.; and this gave the electorate full fifty-nine days&nbsp; to know and determine the office for which the&nbsp; petitioner was&nbsp; running.&nbsp; That&nbsp; no confusion resulted from his withdrawal,&nbsp; is borne out by the fact of record that the petitioner&nbsp; was not voted upon as&nbsp; candidate for member&nbsp; of provincial board of Negros Occidental in any municipality&nbsp; of&nbsp; said province.&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp; it is very doubtful whether the great mass of voters ever&nbsp; bother about knowing who are&nbsp; the candidates for the different elective offices&nbsp; through&nbsp; their certificates of&nbsp; candidacy;&nbsp; and&nbsp; except perhaps the&nbsp; Commission&nbsp; on Elections and other election officials, the electorate come to know the various candidates in&nbsp; any election through the latter's own campaigns, announcements, posters, circulars and cards.<br><br>What is&nbsp; more, we cannot&nbsp; be blind to the fact,&nbsp; also shown by the record, that the herein petitioner received more votes than his only political&nbsp; opponent,&nbsp; intervenor Mateo Garganera; and if the position of the&nbsp; respondent Commission should be adopted, at least the majority of the voters of Victorias,&nbsp; Negros Occidental, would&nbsp; have been deprived of their choice.<br><br>Wherefore, the petition for certiorari is hereby granted, the resolutions of the respondent Commission on Elections of October&nbsp; 18&nbsp; and 25, 1955&nbsp; declared null and void,&nbsp; and the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction&nbsp; heretofore issued made permanent.&nbsp; So ordered with costs.<br><br><i>Padilla, Bautista, Angelo, Labrador,</i> and <i>Concepcion, JJ.,</i>concur.<br><br><i>Reyes, A,, J,, </i> concurs in the result.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING:</span><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">MONTEMAYOR, <span style="font-style: italic;">J.,</span></span><br><br>With the majority I vote on the ground that there&nbsp; is reason to believe as claimed by petitioner that his certificate of candidacy for the office of provincial board member&nbsp; was filed by mistake, as evidenced by his immediate withdrawal of said certificate of candidacy or rather the following day. Had he&nbsp; made the withdrawal later, especially if much later, so as to justify&nbsp; a&nbsp; suspicion or inference that the withdrawal&nbsp; was&nbsp; not to correct an&nbsp; honest&nbsp; mistake,&nbsp; but rather,&nbsp; because&nbsp; after say, studying the situation, he believed he had more chances of getting elected Mayor, the office for which he had filed his other certificate of candidacy, than for the other office, then I would hold that the Commission on Elections was right in declaring petitioner eligible for neither officeâ€”that of Mayor and member of the provincial board,<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">CONCURRING:</span><br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">REYES, J. B. L., <span style="font-style: italic;">J.,</span></span><br><br>I concur solely on the&nbsp; ground that the withdrawal of petitioner's candidacy for member of the provincial board was filed on September 10, at 9:40 a.m., so close to the last day for filing certificates of candidacy (September 9) that to all intents and purposes he was only a candidate for one&nbsp; post, that of mayor of&nbsp; Victorias.&nbsp; I reserve my vote as to whether he would&nbsp; be entitled to have the&nbsp; withdrawal of his&nbsp; candidacy to the provincial&nbsp; board considered if he had delayed filing the same much beyond September 9.</div>
