				<H3>PIO DURAN, PETITIONER, VS. SALVADOR ABAD  SANTOS, JUDGE OF PEOPLE'S COURT, RESPONDENT.
  <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>JARANILLA, ACTING C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This  certiorari proceeding was instituted  by  petitioner Pio Duran against  respondent Honorable Salvador  Abad Santos, Judge of  the People's Court,  praying  that  the order of said respondent judge of October 12 and October 15, 1945,  denying him  bail  be  set aside  and that he be allowed to put up  a  bail  not to exceed P20,000 for his provisional release.</p>
<p>The pertinent  allegations of the petitions are:</p>
<p>That the petitioner  is a Filipino political prisoner under the custody of the Director of Prisons in the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa, Rizal,  for not less than three months without any information having filed  against him;</p>
<p>That the petitioner  filed a petition in the People's Court for his release on bail and that the Solicitor General recommended that the  petitioner be provisionally released on P35,000 bail ;</p>
<p>That after hearing  the statements of Special Prosecutor V. D.  Carpio, in representation  of the  Solicitor General, and  Atty.  Marciano Almario, counsel for the petitioner, which statements are  contained in Appendix  B of the petition, the  said respondent  judge  denied  the petition  for bail  on October  12, 1945, and refused to reconsider it by his order issued  on October 15, 1945; and</p>
<p>That the denial of said petition is a  flagrant violation of the Constitution  of the Philippines  and of  section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 682, and that the respondent has committed a great abuse  of discretion for which petitioner has no other  plain  speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course  of law.</p>
<p>The respondent judge, in answer to the petition, denies abuse of discretion and alleges that the reason for the denial of the petition for the  release of  the  petitioner on bail was set forth in his order of October 15, 1945, which reads as  follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The detainee's adherence to the  enemy as manifested by his utterances  and  activities during the Japanese  domination especially as Executive General of the Makapili; as Director of General Affairs of the Kalibapi; as Vice-Minister of State for Home Affairs; as member of the Council of State; as  member of the National Assembly under  the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Republic and as President of the New Leaders Association—historical facts of contemporary history and of public knowledge which the petitioner  cannot deny— makes the  case against him quite serious  and may necessitate the imposition of the capital punishment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence against the petitioner,  according  to said Appendix E of the petition, consists of documentary proofs received by  the Office  of  Special Prosecutors from  the Counter Intelligence  Corps (CIC), which documentary evidence is considered confidential, having been received with that injunction from the  military authorities, and  so  the special prosecutor who appeared at the hearing in the court below manifested that he  was not free to divulge the contents  thereof.  The special prosecutor, however, mentioned in his statements before the  People's Court  certain facts which are stated by the respondent judge in  his  answer to the petition.</p>
<p>It appears  that the petitioner  was  originally detained by the  United States Army,  which  had investigated the acts of said petitioner and gathered the  corresponding evidence; and that after the hostilities were ended, with the formal acceptance by Japan of the terms of the Allies, the said petitioner and the evidence gathered against him were turned over to the Commonwealth Government and  the Office of Special Prosecutors  for  such  action as may be warranted.   The said petitioner was detained by the military authorities from July 4 to September 26, 1945, when he was turned over to the Commonwealth Government, as may be gleaned from Appendix A filed by him in this case. As a military political prisoner, he could not be bailed out. Now he invokes the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 682, creating the  People's Court and the Office of Special Prosecutors, and specifically section 19 of said Act, as said section reads partly as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  *  *  <em>Provided, however</em>, That existing provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the aforesaid political prisoners may, in the discretion of the People's Court, after due notice to the Office of Special Prosecutors and hearing, be  released on bail, even prior to the presentation of the corresponding information, unless the Court finds that there  is strong evidence  of the commission  of a capital offense  *  *  *."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As may  be seen the  above express  provision  of law, the release  of  a detainee on bail, "even prior to the presentation of the corresponding1 information," is purely discretionary on  the People's Court.  The only exception to it is when  "the Court finds that there  is strong evidence of the commission of  a  capital offense," in which  case no bail whatever can be granted, as the  provision appears mandatory.  In other words, aside from that, the People's Court  has  the absolute  discretion to  grant bail  or not. Having invoked the clear provision of said section 19 of Act No. 682 for his temporary release on bail, the petitioner cannot attack  it as being illegal or unconstitutional.  And it appearing that  his  case is covered by said exception of the law, it must be held that he cannot be admitted to bail. But  even if we should concede counsel's contention, for the sake of argument, that the People's Court has not been given that  discretion to  deny bail to the petitioner, still the conclusion of the respondent judge is not unfounded for the following reasons:</p>
<p>First, the special prosecutor stated that the information to be filed in the case would be for treason, which is "the highest of all crimes"   (<em>In re</em> Charge to Grand  Jury, 80 F.  Cas., No. 18, 269; 2  Curt., 530; U. S. <em>vs.</em> Lagnason, 3 P.  R.  A.  247; 3 Phil., 472, U. S. <em>vs.</em> Abad, 1 Phil.,  437), penalized with  capital punishment under  article 114 of the Revised Penal Code;  and</p>
<p>Secondly,  the recital  by the special prosecutor of the supposed acts committed by the petitioner and. referred to by the respondent judge in his order of October 15,  1945, above quoted, which acts were not rebutted by counsel for the petitioner at the hearing on the petition for bail, supports the conclusion and ruling of the People's  Court.</p>
<p>It is true that  during the oral argument  in this  case counsel for the petitioner denied the imputation  that the petitioner was the Executive General of the  "Makapili," but he openly admitted  that  at the  hearing before the People's Court he  did not make any effort to  deny or disprove  the said imputation or the others appearing in Appendix E of the petition.  In view thereof, how can we expect the People's Court not to take into  consideration what  had been stated  then, appearing in said Appendix E?</p>
<p>Counsel's contention that the special prosecutor should have  presented evidence  to prove that there  was strong evidence of the commission of a capital offense before the People's Court could  deny bail in this case was substantially  complied with,  although the information charging the commission  of the crime of treason had not as yet been filed.  We  are of the opinion and so hold that the hearing set and held  for the purpose  (see Appendix E) was amply sufficient for the People's Court to  be informed and to determine whether there was strong evidence of the commission  of a  capital  offense.  The  special prosecutor clearly informed the People's Court in the presence of the adverse counsel,  in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"*  *  * I understand strict assurance  has been made that ail witnesses required  to make  a testimony will  be considered secret, and  that  their statements will be held  strictly confidential  and if we have to  answer that question  now as propounded by the Court, as I have said,  I would be violating the injunction given to us to consider those documents as confidential.  I may venture, however, to explain by stating several  facts which we believe are so  well known not only by the Court or by the Office of the Special Prosecutors but by the people as a whole, which no one can  deny, not even the detained  petitioner  or anyone else, and those facts are as follows:  That the petitioner herein was a member of the Council of State during the Japanese  occupation.  He was the Director of General Affairs of the Kalibapi.   He was  elected member of the National Assembly under the  puppet  Kepublie.  He was Vice-Minister of  State for  Home Affairs.  He was the Executive General of the Makapili.  Lastly, he became President of the New Leaders Association.  These facts, I repeat, are things which I venture to say neither the  petitioner nor anyone  else can dare deny and, therefore, I feel  free  to divulge without any violation of trust  or confidence. Furthermore, I can state with assuredness that among the articles of association of the Malapili, of which the petitioner was the Exceutive General, it is stated:  To fight  the common enemies side by side with other Asians on any front in the present war.'   Another: 'To collaborate unreservedly  and unstintedly with the  Imperial Japanes Army  and Navy in the Philippines in such ways and means as may, in the joint judgment of the Imperial Japanese forces and the association (association meaning Makapili) be deemed necessary and  fruitful.'</p>
  <p>"The case of the petitioner herein by reason of his prominence in social,  political and court circles is such that this case has assumed pre-eminence and interest of tremendous proportion not only in this country but perhaps even in the  United States—all  by  reason of known associations, connections and statements made by the detained petitioner publicly  and  privately in his advocacy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and his advocacy  of  Japan as the leading nation in the  Orient in the proposed Asiatic Monroeism on which  he had been working for  so many years before and during the war, and I take it for granted even  now.  And no one can dispute the facts that in his advocacy of  this program  aforesaid the petitioner has made statements, as follows: 'The flight, of MacArthur once again shows that  the White men's interest  in  East Asia is mercenary and imperialistic.  He comes to exploit the people and the  natural  resources,  fill his pockets  with as much wealth as can be obtained  irrespective of the means, and later return to his own native land  to spend the declining years  of his life in comfortable indolence. He cares not for the defense  of any of the colonies he may have acquired.  At first sign  of danger he  packs  his bag and baggage and runs away, leaving the native inhabitants to whatever fate awaits them.'  This appears in  an article written by the detained  petitioner in the Tribune of March 22, 1942.</p>
  <p>"Further,  the detained petitioner has said: 'We, who  have always doubted the sincerity of occidental disinterestedness in Asia, adhere to the  theory that it is only through the unified  efforts of all Asiatics that the  complete emancipation  not only  of the Philippines but of all Asia  may be achieved,  that is why we are co-operating solely and wholeheartedly  with the Japanese military administration and urge our countrymen to do  the same.'   That come from  a radio speech, reported in  the Tribune of May 6, 1942.</p>
  <p>"Again, the detained petitioner has stated: 'With the  Japanese spirit  moving the one  hundred million people of Japan,  who  are solidly behind the prosecution of the  Greater  East Asia War to a  successful end, the Great Empire of Japan  cannot be beaten in  the current war.' That  also came from an article  reported in the newspaper, Tribune, July 7, 1942.</p>
  <p>"And on January  30, 1945,  there appeared an article in the Tribune  an item, as follows:  'Lingayen front, Jan. 27.—Makapili members thrust into American lines following the landing of the invaders in the Lingayen gulf shores, it was revealed here.  Forming deathdefying squads, these youthful Filipinos stormed into enemy lines with fixed bayonets causing heavy casualties among the Americans.'</p>
  <p>"Up to the present time, the Office of  Special Prosecutors has not the material time to check up all the evidence submitted to us by the military authorities.   There are more than 4,000 such cases in our hands and unless we are given enough  time it  will be very hard for  us  to go over this particular case.  Eight now, it is our conviction that the  evidence  against the  petitioner is  rather convincing.   Neither have  we  formulated the  necessary information; but I venture to say that when we file the necessary  information to the  Court  it would not be for a simple  crime but for treason.  I submit, however,  the foregoing facts  as above stated to give the Court an  idea of the nature of  the evidence that will in due time be adduced in support of the information  that wo will  file."  (<em>See</em> Payao  <em>vs.</em> Lesaca, 63 Phil., 210.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of the foregoing, it cannot be stated that the petitioner  has been  deprived  of his  liberty without due process of law,  because  his petition for bail had been set for hearing and he was given an opportunity to,be heard when  the  above  circumstances  were  submitted to  the People's Court, where it was made to  appear satisfactorily that he was being detained due to highly treasonable  activities  against the Commonwealth of the  Philippines and the United .States, which activities would be charged in the information for  a capital offense and  punishable by death, and that the  evidence in the case  was strong.</p>
<p>Wherefore, we find and so hold that the petition is without merit  and therefore the same is hereby ordered dismissed with costs against the petitioner.   So ordered.</p>

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRENTE</em></p>
<p><strong>DE LA ROSA,</strong> Magistrado Interino,</p>
<p>Concurro y voto con la mayoria, en cuanto al  resultado.</p>
<p>El Tribunal del Pueblo, al senalar y celebrar vista sobre la solicitud de fianza del  recurrente, concedidle, asi coxno al Procurador General,  oportunidad de ser oido, y habiendo Uegado despues  a la conclusion de que existen pruebas vehementes sobre la comision  de un  delito  grave, no infringio la Constitucidn ni la Ley No. 682 al  denegar dicha solicitud.</p>
<p>Lo que se ha  hecho en el presente caso,  en que el Fiscal informo sobre la naturaleza grave del delito  que se imputa y las pruebas con que se cuenta para  sostener con eficacia la querella que en su tiempo seria presentada por el mismo, la relacion de las cuales es suficientemente clar para  convencer preliminarmente  al Tribunal,  constituye  una vista regular para la sustanciacidn de lina  solicitud para  la iibertad provisional, bajo fianza, de un detenido.   No era necesario que el Fiscal presentara todas sus  pruebas o que se practicasfi una investigacion previa  o preliminary porque en el  primer caso hubiera sido  tramitar la causa  en su fondo  y en el segundo el articulo 22 de la Ley No. 682 no lo requiere.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * * a preliminary examination  and/or  investigation shall not be  required."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Es solo aparente la desarmonfa que se arribuye entre el articulo 19 de la Ley No.  682, en su parte que  provee:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"* * *<em> Provided, however,</em> That existing provisions of  law to the contrary notwithstanding, the  aforesaid political prisoners may, in the discretion of the People's Court, after due  notice to the Office of the  Special Prosecutors and hearing, be released on bail, even prior to the presentation of the corresponding  information, unless the Court finds that there is strong evidence of the commission of a capital  offense  *  *  *"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>y  la section 16 del Articulo III de  la  Constitution,  que preceptua:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All persons shall before conviction be bailable by sufficient sureties, except those charged  with capital  offenses when  evidence of guilt is strong."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>La frase "Provided,  however,  That existing  provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding," de la parte acotada del  articulo 19 de la Ley No. 682, explica que solo se refiere a las leyes del Congreso, que  el Congr.eso puede deshacer,  sin abarcar las  disposiciones  constitucion&amp;les,  que el Congreso no  puede invalidar.   Ademas como hay que interpretar .esa parte de la Ley  No. 682  en su  espiritu y sin perder de vista los derechos  individuales, resulta una parafrasis del precepto constitutional que de una manera clara reconoce  el  derecho  a la libertad provisional, bajo fianza,  cuando  la  imputation no  es por .un  delito grave, caso en el cual es discretional para el juez  el otorgarlo o no.</p>
<p>Si a la expresada parte  de la Ley No. 682 s.e diese una interpretation  literal, el Tribunal  del Pueblo tendria,  en los casos en que penden cargos  por delitos  no capitales, la afysoluta discretion para conceder o no libertad  provisional bajo fianza antes o despues de. la presentacion  de la correspondiente querella fiscal, ppr.lo mismo que en ello no establece distincion alguna.  Mas aun: la oracion "even prior to  the  presentation of the corresponding information," denota  que dicha disposicion, si es aplicable antes  de la presentacion de la querella, lo es mas despues de su archivo.  Las leyes del Commonwealth han ido paralelamente con  el progreso humano  en  cuanto concierne al  goce del derecho a la vida y a la libertad,  tan preciada la una como la otra.   No seria ahora justo atribuir  a esta Ley No. 682 un motivo feaccionario.</p>
<p>Desmenuzando el texto del expresado precepto constitutional, se halla que la disposicion "all persons shall before conviction be  bailable" es amplia y abarca tanto al que acaba de ser detenido como a aquel contra quien ya  se ha presentado denuncia o queralla; y, asimismo, la palabra "charged" es  lata, porque a ninguna persona se le detiene sin cargo, formulado o no formulado todavia ante los tribunales.</p>
<p>En esto ilustra este  precedente:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>B. Bight to release on bail</em>—I. At common law.  By the common law all offenses, including treason, murder, and other felonies, were bailable before indictment found,  although the granting or refusing of each  bail in case of capital  offense was a matter within the discretion of the court."  (6 Corpus  Juris,  953.) </p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>PERPECTO, J.,</strong></p>
<p>The action taken by the majority will surely dampen the enthusiasm, the ecstatic delight, the rapturous exultation with which  all the generous spirits  the world over received the news of the end of  the war on September  2. 1945, not because of the Allied victory in the global struggle, but because the great principles of human freedom, the sublime tenets upon which the worth  of each  individual, man, woman, and child, is established, the elemental ideas "universally recognized as underlying the basic meaning  of mankind's dignity, once again, triumphed  against the forces of  darkness.</p>
<p>Human liberty suffered a crushing blow.  It seems that the struggle  for human liberty must be  fought all over again.</p>
<p>"With the formal surrender of the Japanese Empire today, September 2, 1945, the long and terrible war is at an end," said President Osmefia in an official message to the Filipino people, adding: "Our effort has been devoted toward the paramount task of winning the war.   Today the task is done.  We must devote ourselves to the task of winning the peace."  (41 Off. Gaz., Sept. 1945, p. 499.)   But that peace cannot be won until and unless the fundamental human freedoms for which millions of lives were offered in  the  recent  gory  holocaust  are firmly  secured  and guaranteed.</p>
<p>More than two millennia ago the following words were written in the pages of the Book of Books, held the most sacred by the most civilized countries in two hemispheres: "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a  jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto  his possessions, and ye shall return  every  man unto his  family."  (Leviticus, 25:20.)</p>
<p>Are we Christians?   Do we believe in the teachings of the Bible?  Have we faith in the biblical  doctrines which are the most vitalizing essentials of Democracy?  How can we  "return every man unto his family" if we deprive Mm of his personal freedom in utter violation of the cardinal mandates of  our Constitution, wherein it is solemnly enjoined  that  "No person shall be deprived of his liberty without due process of law" ?  How can we "Proclaim liberty throughout all  the land unto  all the inhabitants", when we are keeping in bondage one of the citizens of our country in complete disregard of the laws of the land?</p>
<p>Those of us who have descendants and hope that they will continue living in this land,  create families, bear children, and perpetuate our lineage in unending generations, cannot look without  grave concern  at the pernicious consequences of the legal ideology or lack of ideology which permits the wanton trampling of human liberty, such as this case discloses.  We  shudder at the thought of  the dangers to personal security and freedom which the future holds as a despairing promise of  doom to our most cherished ideals and aspirations for the happiness of our loved ones, in  whose arteries and veins, when the sorrows and preoccupations and joys of our own life will be eternally silenced within the folds of cerement, will continue flowing the life-giving streams of our  own blood, by which we will attain a  kind of immortality  in the unconscious  working and endeavors for the perpetuation of the species.</p>
<p>"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure"—asked Jefferson—"when  we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the mind of the people that these  liberties are of the gift of  God?  That they are not to be  violated but with  his wrath?  Indeed, I tremble for my  country when I reflect that  God  is just;  that  his justice cannot sleep forever; that considering  numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution  of the wheel of fortune, an exchange  of situation is  among possible events; that it may become a probable by supernatural interference.  The Almighty has no attribute which can take sides with us in such a contest."</p>
<p>That is why he wrote in the  Declaration of Independence of the United States these immortal words: "All men are created equal, they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   To secure these rights  governments are instituted, deriving their power from the consent of the governed.   Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of  these ends, it is the right of the people to  alter it."</p>
<p>We  borrow  the following  from  Senator  Elbert  D. Thomas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Had the  social and political  significance  of  Jesus's teachings  of the worth of the  individual soul borne its fruit in the practice of the Church, the world might long ago have seen a lasting free society.   For Jesus,  all men were brothers and equally precious  in the sight  of  God, their Father.  Jew and Gentile, bond and  free, black and white,  each was free to work out his own salvation.   In the realm of the spirit the early Christian philosophy exalted the individual, giving him freedom to choose and to 'bear testimony.' "</p>
  <p>"The torch of freedom has  often been  lighted; it has been burned brightly  for brief  periods.   The flame has been often burned low, sometimes flickered, but has never been quite extinguished.  Always again it has been raised, here in the cause of religious liberty, there in the cause of political freedom.   It  remained for the founders of the American Republic to plan a society wherein all phases of freedom, of religion, of speech,  and  of person, should become a reality.  And Thomas Jefferson, as the embodiment of the spirit of Americanism, combining in  himself the zeal of all the past apostles of freedom, thus becomes one of the world's great leaders in man's ancient quest.   Because he gathered together the aspirations of all  the fighters for freedom who had  gone before, all phases  of liberty were equally important  to him.  Building upon  the foundation laid throughout all past ages,  he became  America's first world citizen."  (Thomas Jefferson, World Citizen,  p. 142.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Convinced that the principles of human  liberty  are imperishable, we write this opinion as an appeal to the sense of justice of the majority.</p>
<p>We must not allow our personal experience during the more than three years of enemy occupation,  our own sufferings under the  brutal  Nippon regime, our feelings towards  those who blindly or  malignantly collaborated with our oppressors, our prejudices against those who in any way helped the Japanese, to sway our judgment  in considering the merits of  the case.</p>
<p>All of us have grievances to complain.  We, who were fortunate  enough to have survived are mourning  for the loss of loved ones, near or distant relatives, friends.  All of us were witnesses of the most abhorrent acts committed by Japanese myrmidons, spies, tools and agents.  The ruins in Manila  are constant reminders of a hated recent past. The  thousands  who  lay  buried  in the debris will not breathe again the breath of life.  It is therefore natural that we should feel very strong feelings as a result of the bitter experience.  It is natural that many things will be seen by us  through the colored prisms of such feelings.  On the other hand, we have our sworn duty to do justice with absolute impartiality.  The task is not easy.  But it is our inescapable duty to do it, no matter what our feelings and prejudices  might be.  We  should not  allow  the strength of these feelings and prejudices to  impede us to be equal to our official functions as judges.</p>
<p>We must keep always in mind that political offenses are sure to arouse popular emotions, sometimes uncontrollable. The  mob  psychology  is  very  contagious.  Justices  and judges must guard against the effects of such contagion. That is the reason why Congress, in creating the People's Court, made it  collegiate, a measure which it considered necessary to  place those accused of political offenses, with the special protection, in the same category as  other accused in the  matter of the protection of their substantial rights in their trials.   The protection is special, but it was devised to  make more effective the equal protection of the laws and to  avoid  discrimination against alleged political offenders.</p>
<p>We may loathe the role petitioner played under the  Japanese regime with all the energies of our soul.  We might not forget  what he did or said with respect to important matters which  were  of paramount importance  to us as Filipinos.  But  in the discharge of our judicial  functions it is our imperative duty to set aside our sympathies and aversions,  lest we incur  in the same pernicious  ideology we detest in  the Japanese and those who collaborated  with them.  Complete detachment from our personal  likes and dislikes in an indispensable element if we should administer real justice.  Law and justice have no  personal feelings. Justice has been represented as a blindfolded lady.   Right and wrong have no nationalities, political attachments, or prejudices.  We must judge the petition, forgetting who the petitioner is.  If the  petition is right, it must be granted no  matter how we may abhor the petitioner or his acts. If the petition is wrong, it must be denied no matter how we may sympathize with the person or with his lot.</p>
<p>The Constitution of Nazi  Germany and the Constitution of Fascist Japan, by express provisions, guarantee the personal freedom of their respective citizens.  The guarantees are substantially the same as those written in the Philippine Constitution, only with not so nice and  perfect details. If the letter of the German  and Japanese Constitutions is complied with, the personal liberty of their  citizens will be substantially secure.  But those guarantees in the hands of  German  and Japanese authorities  are just scraps of paper, the same as international treaties and conventions. In  such  ignoring of constitutional guarantees consists, among others, the radical  difference  between  totalitarianism and democracy, between  autocratic  governments and regimes of liberty.</p>
<p>During the enemy occupation we  never compromised with the Japanese.  But now that  the  beaten enemy has been ousted from our country, are we to adopt theix hated procedures of trampling upon the constitutional guarantees for the liberties of our people and citizens?  Shall we borrow their  ideology?  Shall we adopt their way of thinking?</p>
<p>In dealing with this case, we must  forget who the petitioner is, and remember only the sanctity of the law, the sacredness of our Constitution.   Even the Jew in the middle ages  was made by Shakespeare to exclaim: "I  crave the law."  Shylock says, besides;  "If  you deny me, file upon your law; There is no force in the decrees of Venice," A human wreck, a derelict, does  not,  for the reason of his condition, lose his rights under our laws.  A supposed criminal is entitled to legal protection.  Whatever we might think or feel against the petitioner, whatever our personal prejudices  are, it is our duty  not to deny him what the law  recognizes as due him. </p>
<p>We have, we must have, a  government  of  laws.  The equal protection of the laws shall not be denied to anyone, rich or poor, old or young, wise or fool, man or woman, noble or lowly,  prince or tatterdemalion, saint or depraved, patriot  or  traitor, citizen or man without a country.</p>
<p>Whatever imputations can be  hurled  against  the  petitioner,—and it seems all that could be made were already stated by the special prosecutor before the court below—we cannot  form upon him a concept worse than the world has  formed against the German archcriminals, those responsible,  among others, of the grisly slaughterhouses of Maidanek,  Dachau and Buchenwald, of the attempted mass wiping  out of whole racial groups, the crime newly designated as "genocide."  But those archcriminals  are not being denied the  fundamental rights to have a fair trial, to be defended by attorneys, to  present their evidence, because the denial of such fundamental rights,  universally recognized  by  the civilized world, will shock  the  conscience  of  humanity.  Even the repellent General Yamashita, the man  most hated by the Filipinos, is well-fed, is provided with  all facilities to  defend himself, is allowed to cross-examine the witnesses for the  prosecution, and will  be allowed to testify and offer evidence.  Is there any reason for  giving petitioner herein a deal worse than those monstrous  archcriminals, whose crimes stagger our imagination? The  ability to do justice, even to enemies and to persons  we hate is precisely  one of the inherent virtues of democracy.  It is one of its characteristics, making it essentially  different from autocracies and dictatorships.</p>
<p>At this moment we cannot refrain from repeating the words the  outstanding  philosopher-jurist Jhering wrote in his little big book, "The Struggle for Law":</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'"I crave the law.'  In those four words, the poet has described  the relation of law in the subjective, to law in the  objective, sense of the term  and the meaning of the struggle for law, in a manner better than any philosopher of the law could have done it.  These four words change Shylock's claim into a question of the law of Venice.  To what mighty, giant dimensions,  does not the weak man grow,  when he speaks these words: It is  no longer the Jew demanding his pound of flesh; it is the law of Venice itself knocking at the door of Justice; for his rights and the law of Venice are one and the same; they both stand or fall together.  And when he finally succumbs under the weight of the judge's decision, who wipes out his rights by a shocking piece of pleasantry,  when we see him pursued by bitter scorn, bowed, broken, tottering on his way, who can help feeling that in him the law of Venice is humbled ; that it is  not the Jew, Shylock, who moves painfully away, but the typical figure of the Jew of the middle ages, that pariah of society who cried in vain for justice?  His fate is eminently tragic,  not because his rights are denied him, but because he, a Jew of the  middle ages, has faith in the law—we might say just as  if we were a Christian— a faith in the law firm as a rock which nothing can shake, and  which the judge himself feels until the catastrophe breaks upon him like a thunderclap,  dispels the illusion and  teaches him that he is only the despised medieval Jew to whom  justice  is done by defrauding him.</p>
  <p>"The picture of Shylock conjures up another before my mind, the no less historical than poetical one of  Michel Kohlhaas, which Heinrich von Dleist  has described in his novel of that name with all the fascination of truth.  Shylock retires from the scene entirely broken down by grief; his strength is gone and he bows without resistance to the decision  of the  judge.  Not so  Michel Kohlhaas.  After every means to obtain his rights,  which have been most grievously violated, has  been exhausted;  after an act of sinful  cabinet—justice has  closed the way  of redress to him, and  Justice herself in all her representatives, even to the highest, has sided with injustice, a feeling of infinte woe  overpowers him at the contemplation of the  outrage that has been done him and he exclaims: 'Better be a dog, if I am to be trampled under foot, than a man'; and he says: 'The man who refuses me the protection of the law relegates me to the condition of the savage of the forest, and puts a club in my hand to defend  myself with."  He snatches the soiled sword out of  the hand of such venal Justice and brandishes it in a manner that spreads consternation far  and wide through  the country, causes the State to shake to  its very foundations and the prince to tremble on his throne.   It is not, however, the savage feeling of vengeance that animates him; he  does not turn murderer and brigand, like Karl  Moor, who wishes  'to make the cry of revolt resound through all nature to  lead into the fight against the race of  hyenas, air, earth and sea,' whose wounded feeling of  justice causes him to declare war against all humanity; but it is a  moral idea which urges him forward, the  idea  that 'it is his  duty to the  entire world  to consecrate  all his strength to the obtaining of satisfaction and to  the  guarding  of  his fellow-citizens against similar injustice.'  To this idea  he sacrifices everything,  his family's happiness, the honor of his name, all his earthly  possessions, his blood, and his life;  and he carries on no aimless war of extermination, for he directs it only against the guilty one, and against all those who make common cause with  him. At last, when the hope of obtaining justice dawns upon him, he voluntarily lays down his arms; but, as if chosen to illustrate by example to what depth of ignominy the disregard of law and dishonor could descend at that time, the  safe conduct given him,  and the amnesty are violated, and he ends his life  on the place of execution.  However, before his  life is taken from him justice is done him, and the thought that he has not fought in vain, that he has restored respect for the law and preserved his dignity as a human being, makes him smile at the horrors of  death; and, reconciled  with  himself, the world, and God, he gladly and resolutely follows the executioner.  What reflections does not this legal drama suggest: Here is an honest.and good man, filled with love,for his family,  with a simple, religious  disposition, who becomes an Attila and destroys with fire and sword the cities in which his,enemy has taken refuge.   And  how is this transformation effected?  By  the.very quality which lifts him morally high above all his enemies who finally triumph over him; by his high esteem  for the law,  his faith  in its sacredness, the energy  of his  genuine, healthy  feeling  of legal  right.   The tragedy of his fate lies in this that his ruin was brought about by the superiority and nobility of his nature, his lofty feeling of legal right, and  his heroic devotion to  the idea of law,  which  made  him oblivious to all else and ready to sacrifice everything for it, in contact with the miserable world of  the time in which the arrogance of the great and powerful was equaled  only by the venality and cowardice of the  judges.  The crimes which he committed fall much more heavily on the prince, his functionaries and his judges who forced him  out of the way of the law into the way of lawlessness.  For no wrong which man has to endure, no matter how grievous, can  at all compare, at least  in the eyes of ingenuous moral feeling, with that which the authority  established by God commits when it itself  violates  the law.  Judicial  murder  is the deadly sin of the law.  The guardian and  sentinel of the law is changed into its murderer; the physician poisons his,patient;  the guardian strangles his ward.   In ancient Rome, the corrupt judge was punished with  death.  For the justice which has violated the  law there is no accuser as terrible as the sombre, reproachful  form of the criminal made a criminal by his wounded feeling of legal right— it is its  own bloody shadow.  The victim of corrupt and partial justice  is driven almost violently out  of the way of the law;  he becomes the avenger of his own wrong, the executor of his' own rights, and it not infrequently happens that, overshooting the mark, he becomes the sworn enemy, of society, a robber and  a murderer.  If, like Michel Kohlhaas, his nature be noble and moral, it may guard him satisfaction.  Here the struggle for  law becomes a criminal,  and by suffering  the penalty of  his  crime, a martyr to his feeling of legal right.  It is  said that the blood of martyrs does not flow in vaint  and the saying may have been true of him.   It may be that his warning shadow sufficed for a long'time to make the legal oppression of which he was the victim an impossibility.</p>
  <p>"In  conjuring  up this shadow, I have desired to show by a striking example how far the very man whose sentiment of legal right is strongest  and most ideal  may  go astray when the  imperfection of legal institutions refuses him satisfaction.  Here the  struggle for  law becomes a struggle against  the law.  The  feeling of  legal right, left in the lurch by the power which should protect it, itself abandons the ground of the law and endeavors, by helping itself,  to  obtain  what ignorance, bad will,  or impotence refuses it.   And it is not only a few very strong and violent characters,  in which the  national feeling of legal right raises  its protest against such a  condition of things, but this protest is sometimes repeated by the whole population under certain forms, which, according to their object or to the manner in which the whole people  or a definite class look upon  them  or apply them, may be considered as popular  substitutes for, and  accessories  to, the institutions of the  state."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">I. ELEMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW ON PERSONAL LIBERTY</p>
<p>Before  proceeding further, we must be allowed to remember some of the elemental principles of law on personal liberty.</p>
<p>The right of personal  liberty consists in  the power of locomotion,  of changing situation, or moving one's person to whatsoever  place  one's own  inclination  may direct without imprisonment or  restraint, unless by due course of law.  (1 Bl. Com.,  135; Butchers' Union,  etc., Co. <em>vs.</em> Crescent City, etc., Co., Ill U.  S. 746; 28 Law.  ed., 585; In Matter of Jacobs, 98 N. Y., 98.)</p>
<p>This right is a natural one such as has ever been the birthright of every freeman, even in thoae ages before civilization had exercised its softening influence  upon man's passions, and is now guarded with jealous care by that inexorable mistress, "the law of the land."  (The Trustees of Dartmouth College <em>vs. </em>Woodward, 4 Wheat.   [U. S.], 518; 4 Law.  ed., 629.)</p>
<p>Due process of law means that whatever the legal proceeding may be, it must be .enforced by  public authority, whether  sanctioned by age or custom, or newly  devised in the discretion  of the  legislative power, in  furtherance of the general public good, which regards and preserves the principles of liberty  and justice.   (Hurtado <em>vs.</em> California, 110 U. S., 516; 28 Law. ed., 232; Roowan<em> vs.</em> State 30 Wis., 129; King<em> vs.</em> Berchet, 1 Show. [Eng. K. B.], 106; R. <em>vs.</em> Ingham, 5 B. &amp; S.  (Eng. Q. B.), 257; Westervelt <em>vs.</em> Gregg, 12 N. Y., 202; Bank of Columbia<em> vs.</em> Ikely, 4 Wheat. [U. S.], 235; 4 Law.  ed., 559; Brown  <em>vs.</em> Levee Commissioners, 50 Miss., 468; Davidson <em>vs.</em> New Orleans, 96 U. S., 97; 24 Law. ed., 616.)  It means  that neither life,  liberty, nor property can be taken, nor the enjoyment thereof impaired, except in the course of the regular administration of the law in the established tribunals.   (<em>Ex parte</em> Virginia, 100 U. S., 866; 65 Law. ed., 686.)</p>
<p>Therefore  an arrest without a warrant, where one  is required by law, is not due process of law.  (Muscoe <em>vs.</em> Com., 86 Va., 443; 10 S. E., 534; State<em> vs.</em> James, 78 N. C., 455; Trustees<em> vs.</em> Schroeder, 58 111., 353.)  But if there is likely to be a failure of justice for want of a magistrate to issue a warrant, an officer may arrest without a warrant.   (Dixon <em>vs.</em> State, 12 Ga. App.,  17; 76 S. E., 794; Waters  <em>vs.</em> Walkover Shoe Co.,—Ga.—; 82 S. E., 537.) And an arrest without a warrant, where one  is necessary, may be waived by the defendant pleading guilty to the complaint contained  in  a subsequently  issued  warrant. (People <em>vs.</em> Lowerie, 163 Mich., 514;  128 N. W., 741.)</p>
<p>Where a warrant is required by existing laws, am authority to arrest without a warrant cannot be implied from a general grant to a municipality of  power to arrest. (Gunderson<em> vs.</em> Struebing, 125 Wis., 173; 104 N. W., 149.)</p>
<p>Relating to the higher crimes, due process of law is said to denote a lawful indictment or presentiment of good and lawful men, (Coke, 2d Insti., 50; affirmed  in  Jones<em> vs.</em> Robbins, 8 Gray [Mass.], 329, in which<em> see</em> dissenting opinion by Justice Merrick; disaffirmed in Hurtado <em>vs.</em> California, supra cit., in which see dissenting opinion by Justice Harlan.   <em>See also </em>Taylor <em>vs.</em> Porter, 4 Hill [N. Y.], 140; Hoke <em>vs.</em> Henderson, 4 Dev. [N. C], 1; Jones <em>vs.</em> Perrey, 10 Yerger [Tenn.], 59; 3 Story on Const. U. S., 661; 2 Kent's Com., 13; Saco <em>vs.</em> Wentworth, 37 Me., 172; Emerick<em> vs.</em> Harris, 1 Binn. [Pa.], 416; Murphy <em>vs.</em> People, 2 Cow. [N. Y.]  815; Jackon vs.  Wood,  2 Conn.,  819; Beers <em>vs.</em> Beers, 4  Conn.,  535) and  a public trial,  before a court of competent jurisdiction.  Therefore, where the court at the trial of one charged with murder, directed an officer to stand at the door of the court-room "and see that the room is not overcrowded, but  that  all respectable  citizens be admitted, and have an opportunity to get in when they shall  apply,"  it was held that the right  of the accused to a public  trial, guaranteed  to  him by the constitution, had been violated.   (People <em>vs. </em>Murray,  89  Mich., 276; 50 N. W., 995.)</p>
<p>The government has the right to control its subjects up to that point where society  is safe, but it has no right to go beyond the point of safety.  (Position of Ferrier, 103 111., 373.)   Any law which restrains a man from doing mischief to  his fellow-man increases the personal  liberty of mankind, but  every wanton and causeless restraint of the will of the  subject is a degree of tyranny.   (1  Bl. Com. 126.)</p>
<p>It is one  of the  most commendable  features of our republican form of government that our laws are equal, just, and impartial, and that the humblest member  of society has rights and remedies for the infraction of those rights, that are not exceeded by the rights or remedies of any other man, no matter how high his station.  No  officer oi! the law can, with impunity, set those rights at  defiance.  All officers of the government, from the highest  to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and  are bound to  obey it.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, removed from the whim of ignorance of any magistrate to issue, or  of any person to serve any legal  process whatever unless the provisions of law be strictly followed;  and any restraint of a person, except by due process of law, amounts to a false imprisonment, for which both magistrate and officer may be  liable in damages to the  person deprived of his  liberty, and the  imprisonment may also be made the subject of a criminal prosecution.   (Fisher  <em>vs.</em> McGirr, 1  Gray  [Mass.],  45; Stetson <em>vs.</em> Packer, 7 Cush [Mass.], 564; Stephens<em> vs.</em> Wilkins, 6 Pa. St., 260; Emery <em>vs.</em> Hapgood, 7 Gray [Mass.], 55; Rafferty <em>vs.</em> People, 69 111., 11; Gurney  <em>vs.</em> Tufts, 37 Me., 130; Wise <em>vs.</em> Withers, 3 Cranch [U. S.], 337; 2 Law. ed., 559; Entick <em>vs.</em> Carrington, 2 Wils. [Eng. C. P.], 275; Groome <em>vs.</em> Forrester, 5 M. &amp; S.  [Eng. K, B.], 314; Allen <em>vs. </em>Gray,  11  Conn., 95.)</p>
<p>A magistrate who illegally issues a warrant  without a sworn  complaint is liable for trespass on an arrest made on such warrant,  and he cannot justify by  showing that he had a  reasonable  suspicion that an  offense had been committed.   (McGuhmess<em> vs.</em> Da Foe, 3 G,  C. C. [Can.], 139; Campbell <em>vs.</em> Welsh, 18 C. C. C. [Can.], 316; Papillo vs. R.,  20 C.  C. C. [Can.],  329.)</p>
<p align="center">II. THE PACTS  IN THIS CASE</p>
<p>With the above legal axioms in mind, let us consider the facts in this case.</p>
<p>Petitioner alleges that he is a Filipino political prisoner detained in the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinglupa, under the custody of the Director  of Prison; that on  October. 4, 1945, he filed with the People's Court a petition  for a Writ of habeas corpus, with allegations and prayer  for provisional release on bond, in case his absolute freedom cannot be, for some reason, granted; that on  October 5, 1945, he withdrew said petition for a  writ of habeas corpus in order to stand solely on his allegations  and petition for provisional release on bond; that on October 6, the Solicitor General submitted a recommendation to the People's Court to allow  petitioner to be released provisionally on a bail of P35,000,  "on the strength of the  evidence"  in his possession ; that respondent Judge issued an order  setting the case for hearing on October 8, requiring the Solicitor General to appear at said hearing "for the purpose of giving such information to the Gourt as  may enable it to determine whether the case is  bailable or not  and,  if bailable, what amount should be required;  that at the hearing Special  Prosecutor V. D. Carpio,  representing  the Solicitor General,  manifested that  he refused to reveal their evidence,  adding  that they  cannot certify to the degree of truthfulness of said  evidence  for the reason that  they have not  been able to check them up, but then recited a series of  charges against  the petitioner,  which according to him, were of public knowledge; that petitioner filed a memorandum citing  the  doctrine established by the Supreme Court in the  case of People vs. Marcos (G.  R. No.  46490); that on October 12,  respondent Judge issued an order denying the petition for provisional release  on bail,  without  stating any  reason  in support  thereof; that immediately upon  receipt of said order, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration  based on three grounds, namely:  (<em>a</em>) that the Solicitor General recommended that petition be  granted upon  a  bail of P35,000; (<em>b</em>) that the Solicitor General did  not  reveal any evidence  against the petitioner;  (<em>c</em>)  that  refusal to disclose such evidence entitled petitioner to bail; and that on  October 15 the motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>
<p>In the order of  denial  respondent judge  stated the following grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The detainee's adherence to the  enemy  as  manifested by his utterances and activities duringthe Japanese domination,  specially as Executive General of the  Makapili; as  Director of General Affairs of the  Kalibapi; as Vice-Minister of  State for Home  Affairs;  as  member  of  the Council  of State; as member of the National  Assembly under the Japanese sponsored Philippine Republic,  and as President  of the New Leaders'  Association—historical facts of contemporary history and  of  public knowledge which the petitioner cannot deny—makes the case against him quite serious and may necessitate  the imposition of the capital  punishment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is contended by petitioner that  the action of the respondent is a deliberate transgression of the  fundamental law of the land, invoking for said purpose the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All persons shall before conviction be bailable by  sufficient sureties, except those  charged with capital offenses  when evidence of guilt is strong. Excessive bail shall not be  required."   (Art.  III,. sec. No, 16, Constitution of the Philippines.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner  invokes,  too, the  provision of section 19  of Commonwealth Act No. 682, creating the  People's  Court,. wherein  it is provided that "existing provisions  of  law to the contrary notwithstanding, the aforesaid political prisoners may, in the discretion of the People's  Court, after due notice to the Office of Special Prosecutors  and hearing, be released on bail, even prior to the presentation  of  the corresponding information, unless the  Court finds that there is strong  evidence of the commission  of  a capital offense."</p>
<p>It is also alleged by petitioner that he is being detained for no less than three months and  no  information has been. filed against him  so  far.</p>
<p>In the petition it is prayed  that the  orders of the  respondent Judge of October 12 and October  15, be annulled, and respondent be directed to  enter a new order granting the petition for  the provisional release of petitioner  oa bail not to exceed P20,000.</p>
<p align="center">III.  PETITIONER IS DETAINED WITHOUT  DUE PROCESS OP LAW</p>
<p>The recital of the undisputed facts of this case  shows conclusively to any unscleroid brains  that petitioner is  actually  being deprived of his liberty  without due process of law.</p>
<p>It appears that petitioner surrendered to the American forces on July 4, 1945, and remained as prisoner of war of said forces until he was delivered on September 26,1945, to the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no showing of  any official order issued by any authority of the  Commonwealth Government by which petitioner  should be detained or  restrained of his personal liberty.  There is absolutely no law which authorizes his detention.   There is not  any lawful act from the executive department which decrees the deprivation of petitioner's liberty.   There is absolutely no judicial decision, resolution, order, or decree  issued by a  competent tribunal ordering the  detention of petitioner.</p>
<p>Process is a writ, warrant, subpceena, or other formal writing issued by authority of law; also the means  of accomplishing an end, including judicial proceedings.   (3 Bl. Com.,  279; Gollobitsch vs.  Rainbow,  84 Iowa, 567.)  The word "process" is also used as a general term to cover all the written means of compelling a  defendant  to appear in court.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, we  are of opinion  that petitioner   enjoys  the  absolute   constitutional  right  to  be restored to his personal freedom.</p>
<p>The Philippine Constitution provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"No person shall  be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law,  nor shall any person  be denied the equal  protection of  the laws."   (Art. Ill, sec. 1, No. 1,  Constitution  of the Philippines.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner is deprived of  his liberty without due process of law, without any legal process at all.</p>
<p>We  have  already stated  our stand on this question in our two opinions in the case of  Raquiza  <em>vs.</em> Bradford (G. R. No.  L-44, p. 76, <em>ante</em>), and in the case of  Reyes <em>vs.</em> Crisologo  (G. R. No. L-54,  p.  236,  <em>ante</em>).</p>
<p>In the first case, petitioners Raquiza et al., were under the custody of the American armed forces exactly in the same situation as petitioner herein was before his transfer to the  Commonwealth Government.</p>
<p>Raquiza et al., were political prisoners detained without any process of law, and we voted that they were entitled to their personal freedom and for the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus they prayed for.</p>
<p>In said case, a  majority of  this Court voted  for the denial  of the petition upon the assumption that this Court has no jurisdiction, to issue the writ when petitioners were under  the custody of the United States Army, stationed in the Philippines, and assuming that war has not ended yet,  probably without  knowledge of the official message issued to  the  Filipino people by President Sergio Osmeña on September 2, 1945, wherein the Chief  Magistrate of the nation announced the end of war as of said day.</p>
<p>Circumstances have  changed.</p>
<p>Petitioner is not now under the custody of the American Army.  He is under the custody of  the Philippine Government.  He is  under the custody of civil Filipino  officials. War has ended  according to the official declaration of the Chief Executive of the Philippines.  Therefore, the claim for restoration  of liberty is still stronger in regards to the herein petitioner.</p>
<p>It is true that  petitioner filed  a  petition  for a writ of habeas corpus with the understanding that, if said  petition is denied, he prayed to be allowed to enjoy provisional liberty on bail.  It is true also that he changed Ms alternative petition to stand only on the  petition to be allowed to be  free  on  bail.   It  is  also true, however,  that the constitutional right to personal freedom cannot be waived. And it is also  true  that the Rules of Court are not so particular about procedure technicality in habeas corpus cases.  Section  9  of Rule provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"SEC. 9  <em>Defect of form.</em>—<em>No writ of habeas corpu</em>s can be disobeyed  for defect of form, if it sufficiently appears therefrom in whose custody or under  whose restraint the party imprisoned or restrained is held and the court or judge before whom he is to be brought"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe, therefore, that, under the circumstances,  the petition  might be  considered  substantially as  one  for habeas corpus, and we are duty bound to grant it.</p>
<p align="center">IV. PETITIONER HAS AN ABSOLUTE EIGHT  TO HIS  LIBEETY,<br>
MUCH MOKE ON BAIL</p>
<p>There being no legal process which justifies the restraining of liberty of petitioner, the latter has an absolute right to be  set  at  liberty  without any condition.  Petitioner erred in withdrawing in the court below  his petition  for habeas corpus, instead of pressing  that the same  be acted upon.</p>
<p>If petitioner is entitled to be free without any condition, without the  duty  of putting  up any bail, there  is more reason for granting his petition to be  given his  freedom when he offers to accept the  condition of  putting up a bail,  and respondent judge committed,  not only an error of law, but also a grave injustice in denying the petition of petitioner to be released on bail.</p>
<p>Petitioner  filed his petition for a writ of habeas  corpus on October 4, 1945, praying to be discharged from further custody and  imprisonment or, at least, be granted  provisional liberty on a reasonable  bond not to  exceed  P10,000.</p>
<p>On October 5, petitioner withdraw his petition  for a writ  of habeas corpus "for personal reasons which need not be expressed," standing on his alternative petition  for provisional release on bond, and prayed that the Solicitor General be requested to make his comment and recommendation on said alternative petition for provisional release.</p>
<p>On October 6, the Solicitor General, represented by Special Prosecutor Macario M. Peralta,  filed  a recommendation stating "that on the strength of the evidence on record, the reasonable bail recommended for the provisional release of petitioner is P35,000."</p>
<p>On the same date, October 6,  Judge R. Nepomuceno, of the People's  Court, upon receiving the favorable  recommendation  of the Solicitor  General, set the  petition for provisional release on  bail for hearing on October 8, and required the  Solicitor  General "to appear at the hearing for the purpose of giving such   information  to the court as may enable it to determine whether the case is bailable or not and, if bailable, what amount should be required."</p>
<p>At the hearing no evidence has been presented because, as Special  Prosecutor  Carpio  said, "the office has not the material time to check up  all the evidence submitted to us by the military authorities,"  and neither have we formulated the  necessary information,"  and that "the  evidence is such confidential in nature that we are not in a position to divulge it at this time."</p>
<p>The information was given, among others, after Judge Nepomuceno  asked: "What evidence  does  the  Solicitor General  have with respect to the prisoner which will enable this court to determine whether the offense for which he is held  in custody is bailable  or not?"</p>
<p>The papers in connection with the case  have been received from the military authorities and, as Special Prosecutor Carpio said, "We have had no chance to  check up all those documents or to verify the truthfulness of the statements therein made  to enable us to  say the degree of the truth or veracity of the facts therein contained."</p>
<p>After said hearing, petitioner's counsel  submitted  a memorandum, invoking the  doctrine laid down by this Supreme Court in the case of  Marcos  (G.  R. No.  46490) wherein it was  stated that the  petition  for provisional release must be set for hearing  in which the prosecution should present  its  evidence, the same  as the defense, to enable the  court to determine if the offense is bailable or not.</p>
<p>On October 12, respondent Judge Salvador  Abad Santos issued the  order of denial worded as follows: "After due hearing of the petition for  provisional release on bail of the political prisoner,  Pio Duran, the court has arrived at the conclusion that the petition should be, as it is hereby, denied."</p>
<p>Immediately, on the said  day, petitioner's counsel filed a motion for reconsideration,  which  was  denied in the order issued on October 15.</p>
<p>No information or  formal charges  having been filed against petitioner, there is absolutely no legal process to justify his detention.   But on the hypothesis that a legal fiction can be accepted to the effect that such information or formal charges for the crime of treason (the  one mentioned by  Special  Prosecutor Carpio), may be  taken as filed,  though  not a  scintilla of evidence has  been presented, the case stands on all fours with the Marcos case, wherein  the  accused  was granted  provisional release  on bail, because  the  prosecution, like what Special Prosecutor Carpio did, refused  to divulge  the evidence against the accused.</p>
<p>In  the light of the doctrine  established in the  Marcos case,  the  court  had  no   other   alternative   than  to grant the provisional release on bail.</p>
<p>The position of  the petitioner became  still stronger if we  take into  consideration the fact that the Solicitor General,  not only did not oppose the petition, but  expressly agreed to it, recommending  that the reasonable  bail "for the provisional release of petitioner is P35,000."</p>
<p align="center">V. SECTION  19 OP COMMONWEALTH ACT NO.  682</p>
<p>Now let us see if section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 682, creating the People's Court, may in  any way justify the action of respondent judge.</p>
<p>There are three parts in said section—the principal provision and two  provisos.  The  principal  provision commands the  Office  of  Special Prosecutors to  receive  all records, documents, exhibits and such other things  as the Government of the United  States may  have turned  over in connection  with  and/or  affecting political prisoners, examine them  "and take, as  speedily  as possible,  such action as may  be proper."</p>
<p>The second proviso suspends for a period of six months the provisions of article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, "insofar as the aforesaid political prisoners are concerned, in the interest of public security." It must be remembered that before the enactment of Commonwealth Act  No. 682, said article has been suspended  by  executive order for a period of thirty days.</p>
<p>The text of  the  first proviso  is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"That existing provisions of law to the  contrary notwithstanding, the aforesaid political prisoners  may, in the discretion of the People's Court, after due notice to the Office of Special Prosecutors and hearing, be  released on bail, even prior to the presentation of  the corresponding informatiton, unless the court finds that there is strong evidence of  the commission of a capital  offense."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The provision authorizes  that the political prisoners in question "may be released on bail, even prior to the presentation of the corresponding information," and this may be done "existing  provisions of  law to  the contrary notwithstanding."</p>
<p>No one has  been able to point out what and which are the alluded  "existing  provisions of law  to the  contrary notwithstanding."  But it seems that Congress  inserted this  sentence as a saving measure,  in order to avoid any possible loophole.   Considering  the  fact that the  law was enacted  in a special legislative  session,  when not enough time  for research  was available, and the urgency of the measure, in  view of the impending  transfer by the U. S. Army of about 4,000  political  prisoners to the Commonwealth  Government,  not being  sure whether there is any provision of law which may prohibit the release on bail of a detained political  prisoner, "even prior to the presentation of the corresponding  information," the  authors of the bill deemed it wise to insert this sentence just in case, so as  to avoid  by lack  of foresight the defeat  of the legislative main  purpose, that is, to permit said political prisoners to be released on bail "even prior to the presentation of the corresponding information, unless the court finds that there is strong evidence of the commission of a capital offense."</p>
<p>The proviso grants the People's Court discretion.  But, discretion in what?   We must assume that the discretion granted must be construed in the sense that the same may be exercised in cases wherein it was not heretofore granted by law.   And  it is reasonable to assume that the discretion granted is to the effect that the People's Court may exercise  jurisdiction to order the release on bail of political  prisoners  "even prior to the presentation  of the corresponding  information."  It  is  so,  because  before the presentation of  said  information, Congress believed that the  court had no  jurisdiction to act upon a  petition for release on bail.</p>
<p>The word "discretion" as used in section 19  of Commonwealth Act No. 682 cannot be construed in the sense that the  People's  Court   may   not  order  the   release  on bail of a political prisoner,  once it exercises jurisdiction on a petition to said effect.</p>
<p>"Unless the Court finds  that there is strong evidence of the commission of a  capital offense," it has no power to deny  a petition for release on bail, because</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"All  persons shall, before conviction, be bailable  by sufficient sureties, except those charged with  capital offenses when  evidence of guilt is strong."  (Sec. 1: 15, Art. Ill, Constitution of the Phil- ippines.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congress could not have intended to defeat or to violate this specific and imperative mandate of the Constitution. It is one of the principles of legal hermeneutics that the legislative intent must  be  construed not  to  violate  any constitutional provisions, unless it is impossible to give an interpretation different  from the  law as worded.</p>
<p>The "discretion" granted by Congress is only to take or not to take cognizance of a petition for "release  on bail, even prior to the presentation of the corresponding information."  If the People's Court refuses to take cognizance of such a petition, the prisoner has always open the doors to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the privilege not having  been suspended.</p>
<p>In granting such discretion, undoubtedly Congress  has in mind that if the political prisoners  in question are not allowed to be released on bail, they might press the courts with  hundreds  or thousands of  petitions for writs  of habeas corpus.</p>
<p>Of course,  even in cases of capital offenses, the courts are empowered to allow the accused to be bailed, although in such cases, the accused cannot invoke any constitutional right when  the evidence  is  strong.   (People  vs.  Banez, G. R. No.  L-26 and People vs. Samano, G. R.  No. L-27, 41 Off.  Gaz., 888.)</p>
<p align="center">VI.  THE  MAJORITY  INTERPRETATION</p>
<p>"As a military political prisoner—so the majority opinion runs—he (the petitioner)  could not be bailed out," a statement  which will  look  in vain for a legal support, especially in  peace  time.</p>
<p>Then coming to construe the provision of section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 682, the majority opinion declares that the power to grant release on bail  is purely  discretionary on the court.  The very words used are scilicet: "As may be seen from the above express  provision of law, the release of a detainee on bail, 'even prior to the presentation of  the corresponding information,' is purely discretionary on the  People's  Court.   The only  exception to it  is when 'the Court finds that there is  strong evidence of the  commission of a  capital offense', in which case no bail whatever can  be granted, at the provision appears mandatory.   In other words, aside from that, the People's Court  has the absolute  discretion to  grant bail or not."</p>
<p>The wording of section 19,  which unfortunately is  not a model of legislative perspicuity,  may apparently justify the interpretation of  the  majority.  But in view of  the provisions of the Constitution, as far as possible, we must avoid reading  in the  lay  a legislative intention violative of specific constitutional mandate,  such as the one making it imperative to allow all persons to be bailed before final conviction, except when charged with capital offense and the evidence of guilt is strong.</p>
<p>If the interpretation of the majority is correct, then we must be compelled to declare section 19 of  Commonwealth Act No. 682 unconstitutional,  where it gives the People's Court absolute  discretionary power to grant or to deny the petition of a prisoner to be released on  bail, a power so unlimited  that it cannot fail to remind us of the abhorrent absolution of a judicial dictatorship.</p>
<p>When a prisoner  or a detainee  is charge with offenses other than capital,  before  final  conviction, he is entitled to be bailed by sufficient surities, and no court has power nor authority to exercise discretion whether to grant or to deny  the  release, because  to deny  it is tantamount  to an abusive dereliction of duty, to trampling one of the fundamental rights held  sacred by our  people, to  reducing our Constitution to a mere scrap of paper.</p>
<p>The Constitution  grants discretion to deny a petition for release on bail  only in cases wherein the accused are charged with  capital  offenses and the evidence of guilt is strong.   But a court is  empowered to grant  or to deny the petition for release in accordance with the doctrine we have already stated  in our opinion in the cases of People <em>vs.</em> Banez  (G. K. No. L-26), and People <em>vs.</em> Samano (G. R. No. L-27, 41 Off. Gaz., 888).</p>
<p align="center">VII. APPLICATION OF  THE BAIL CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION<br>
TO CASES WHEREIN  NO INFORMATION HAS BEEN FILED</p>
<p>Evidently the majority assumes the position that,  because the  corresponding information for a criminal offense has not as yet been  filed  against the petitioner, the bail clause of the Constitution which provides that "all persons shall, before conviction, be bailable by  sufficient sureties, except those charged with capital offenses when evidence of guilt is strong," is not applicable to the  present case, excluding petitioner from  the constitutional description of "all persons."</p>
<p>It interprets the words  "all persons" used by the Constitution as meaning "not  all persons."   It is based on the false  assumption that where the drafters of our Constitution wrote the  word "all," in fact, they wrote "not all," that is, the very opposite  of the  simple meaning, universally  understood, of the word "all."</p>
<p>The Constitution provides that "all persons shall, before conviction, be bailable," but  the majority  opines that this provision  cannot be invoked  in this case for the  reason. that the corresponding information has not as yet been filed against the petitioner.</p>
<p>Why?   Is it because the information has  not yet been filed, petitioner ceased to be included within the words "all, persons"?  Are individuals against  whom no information for any offense has been filed not "persons"?  Since when. have  those against whom  no  information for a criminal offense has been filed  ceased to be "persons"?  Since when can the word "person" only be applied to accused in an information?  What  about us, the  remaining 18 million. Filpinos?</p>
<p>The untenability of the  majority's proposition becomes self-evident by the absurb consequences to which it  immediately and necessarily leads.</p>
<p>Where in the Constitution is written  "all persons",  unless we are  unable  to read,  we must read simply "all; persons."   And when petitioner filed the petition in this, case,  and  we accepted it and gave it due course, ordered respondent judge to  answer it, allowed  both parties  toargue this case in a  public  hearing, it is presumed  that we  took for granted  that  petitioner is  endowed with  the essential attributes and qualities of a person.  This Supreme Court is  not supposed to  accept and entertain any petition coining  from any being not a person, as, anyhow, the act of filing a petition  before this Court can exclusively be performed by a person.</p>
<p>A petitioner is a person, whether  an information has been filed against him or not as yet; he is included among the "all  persons" to  whom the  Constitution grants the fundamental right to be bailed before final conviction for an offense.</p>
<p>The majority's theory of  exempting  from the  words have  those  against whom no information for a criminal "all persons" all those against whom no information for an  offense has  as  yet been filed leads to the additional absurdity of placing  persons, against whom no information has been filed, in a more precarious and  disadvantageous position than persons against whom an information has been filed.  The majority's theory leads to the absurdity of denying person  against whom no information for a criminal  offense has been filed the right to enjoy freedom, which is reorganized and enjoyed by those who are accused. We cannot pass the following statement in the majority opinion unchallenged:  "Having  invoked the clear provision of section 19 of  Act No. 682 for his temporary release  on  bail, the petitioner cannot, therefore,  attack  it as being illegal or unconstitutional."</p>
<p>The proposition is begging the question.</p>
<p>Petitioner interpretes section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 682, and then wants the Supreme Court to interpret it, as in  consonance with the bail clause of the Constitution, and, interpreted  in that way, there is no person for the petitioner to attack its constitutionality.</p>
<p>But the majorty opinion gives said section  a construction which decidedly places it in a headlong conflict with the bail clause of the Constitution.  If this is the case, we do not understand how petitioner, or any other else, can be precluded from impugning the validity of such  section on constitutional grounds.</p>
<p>Petitioner  invokes said  section  19  on the  assumption that it is to be interpreted as not running counter to any constitutional mandate.</p>
<p>Being otherwise construed, he Is entitled   to attack the correctness  of  such interpretation  and, failing in  that endeavor,  it is his  right and,  more  than right, his  civic duty  to denounce  a legal  provision which violates  the fundamental law of the land and try all he  can to have it invalidated.</p>
<p align="center">VIII. NO MATTER WHAT THE MAJORITY SAY, THERE IS AN<br>
ESSENTIAL  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEKJE  STATEMENT OR<br>
RECITAL OF SUPPOSED ACTS AND EVIDENCE.</p>
<p>In the majority opinion there appears a deplorable confusion, by elevating the mere statements made by Special Prosecutor Carpio before the People's Court to the rank and category of an evidence.</p>
<p>In the majority opinion we read:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Counsel's contention that  the  special  prosecutor  should  have presented evidence to prove that there was strong evidence of the commission  of  a  capital offense before the People's   Court  could deny bail in this  case was substantially  complied with, although the information charging the commission  of the crime of treason had not as yet been filed.  We  are of the opinion  and so hold that the hearing set and held for the purpose (<em>see</em> Appendix E) was amply sufficient for the People's Court to be infarmed  and to determine whether there was a strong  evidence  of the commission of a  capital offense.  The special  prosecutor  clearly informed the People's Court in the presence  of the adverse  counsel, in part, as follows:" (Here follows quotations of long statements made by special prosecutor as appearing in  Appendix E.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By  the  foregoing statement,  the  majority   wipes out completely all laws,  decisions, rules, resolutions, and jurisprudence about evidence,  its  concept  and  its  indispensable and  important role in court  proceeding  and in the administration of justice.</p>
<p>Section 1 of Judicial Rule 123, as promulgated by this very Supreme Court, provides:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Evidence defined.</em>—Evidence is the means, sanctioned  by  this rule, of ascertaining' in a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a matter of fact."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 100 sections in Judicial  Rule 123, but there is nothing in those 100 sections authorizing  the  proposition of the majority to the effect that the statements made by the special prosecutor before the People's  Court can take the place of an evidence.</p>
<p>Soon we will be ten and one score years since we were authorized to practice law as a  profession.  In our long experience with law we never had  the  chance of seeing confused a mere statement with  an evidence.</p>
<p>It seems that from the  promulgation of the decision in this case our concepts about a  mere statement and an evidence will  undergo a radical  revision.  Our courts of justice and the bar will have to face the perplexing situation which the revision will create.  Law textbooks and even dictionaries  must have to  be  revised too. We  are afraid, notwithstanding, that the future will appear dark and hopeless.  If mere statements are considered evidence, we are afraid the administration of justice will suffer  a complete frustration.  We tried  to  see light in the confusion between mere statements and evidence,  but we can not glean even  the flickering flashes of  a firefly  in  the gloom and darkness of the future juridical night.</p>
<p>Although  implicitly maintaining that the bail clause of the Constitution is not applicable to petitioner's case, we cannot fail  to perceive  in the majority opinion a weak attempt to show in some  way that  petitioner  is charged with a capital offense and the evidence of guilt is  strong and, therefore, respondent judge  had not violated the bail clause of  the  Constitution.</p>
<p>But the attempt appears futile if we pause for a while to analyze the line of reasoning followed in the majority opinion.</p>
<p>It  runs as follows: "But even  if  we should concede counsel's  contention,  for the sake  of  argument, that the People's Court has not been given that discretion to deny bail to the petitioner, still the conclusion of the respondent judge is not unfounded," because "First, the special prosecutor stated that the information  to  be filed in the case would be for treason," and "Secondly, the  recital by the special  prosecutor of the supposed  acts committed by the petitioner   *  *   *   supports the  conclusion and ruling of the People's Court."</p>
<p>The Constitution provides that:  "All persons  shall before  conviction be bailable by sufficient  sureties, except those charged with capital offenses  when evidence of guilt is strong."   (Art. Ill, sec. 1,  No. 16,  Constitution of the Philippines.)</p>
<p>From the  foregoing, it can be readily seen that, by the very  words  of the  majority,  none of the two  essential elements required by the Constitution to  concur in cases where denial of  bail is  permissible exists in the present case.</p>
<p>The first element is that petitioner must be  "charged with  capital offense," and  according to what we read in the majority's opinion,  no charge  has as yet been  filed, because the special prosecutor  stated that the information is yet "to be filed in  the case."</p>
<p>The second  constitutional  element  is "when  evidence of guilt is strong."   In the present case, not an iota of evidence has been presented to that effect.  Nobody will seriously  attempt to  elevate to the category of evidence the "recital by the special prosecutor of the supposed acts committed by the petitioner."  Otherwise,  the  rights  of all citizens, including the fundamental ones—life, liberty, property, honor—will be placed at the mercy of any special prosecutor.</p>
<p>Huge amounts of property and accumulated riches and treasures were destroyed, millions of lives were sacrificed, untold sufferings were endured by the remaining hundreds of millions of souls to free the earth from the scourge of tyranny  of Mussolini,  Hitler, the Nippon warlords, and other dictators and despots.  No greater tragedy can be inflicted on our people if the  tyranny of the archcriminals is to be replaced by that of the special prosecutors, whose mere "recital"  of supposed  acts  is  evidence enough to prove  the  guilt of any person,  making said  "recital" as powerful as a dreaded imperial ukase.</p>
<p align="center">IX. THE DENIAL OP THE PETITION IS VIOLATIVE OF THE INTERNATIONAL <br>
GUARANTEES CONTAINED IN THE CHARTER OF <br>
THE UNITED NATIONS.</p>
<p>Liberty is one of the fundamental human freedoms guaranteed, not only  in the Constitution of  the  Philippines, but also in the Charter of the United  Nations,  which is in full force in our country.</p>
<p>The denial  of the petition is, therefore, violative of the principles enunciated in said charter, a veritable  International  Constitution by  which the United  Nations, one of them the  Philippines,  became organized  virtually as  a social  unit  under the jurisdiction of a  General Assembly and a Security Council as a  kind of world governmental organisms.</p>
<p>We quote from the Charter of the United Nations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center">"CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS</p>
  <p align="center">"WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED</p>
  <p>"to save succeeding1 generations from the scourge  of war, which twice in  our lifetime  has  brought  untold  sorrow to  mankind,</p>
  <p>and</p>
  <p>to reaffirm  faith  in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth  of the human person, in the  equal rights of  men and women and of nations large and small, and</p>
  <p>to  establish conditions tinder which justice  and respect for the obligations  arising  from treaties  and other  sources of international law can be maintained, and</p>
  <p>to  promote  social progress  and  better standards of life in larger freedom,</p>
  <p align="center">"HAVE RESOLVED TO COMBINE OUR EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH</p>
  <p align="center">"THESE AIMS</p>
  <p>"Accordingly our respective  Governments, through representatives  assembled in the City of San Francisco, who have exhibited their full powers found to be in good and due form, have agreed to the present Charter of the United Nations and  do hereby establish an international organization to be known as the  United Nations.</p>
  <p align="center">"<em>Article </em>1</p>
  <p align="center">*        *       *        *       *       *        *</p>
  <p>"3.

  <p>"c. universal  respect for, and observation of, human rights and fundamental  freedoms for all without  distinction as to  race,  sex, language, or religion."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present controversy is part of  the test mentioned by  President  Osmeña  when, on the occasion of the 38th anniversary of the First Philippine  Assembly, on October 16,  1945, that statesman said: "As we face the future amid the dire aftermath of a bitterly destructive war, the world is again watching the Philippines for we face the greatest test in  all our history—whether this nation, conceived in self-respect and dedicated to the principles of freedom, democracy and  the right of the  common man, can rise  out of the ashes and build a land  of promise  for all."   (Off. Gaz., October, 1945, p. 532.)</p>
<p>Upon signing Commonwealth Act No. 682  on September 25,  1945,  the  President said: "we can  assure the Filipino people and the whole  world that  all who are accused  of collaboration with the enemy will  be  tried by the processes of law  and justice,  which  are firmly  established here  as they are elsewhere in the civilized world."   (Off. Gaz., October,  pp. 690, 691.)   We are afraid  we are  not doing our part  in the assurance  when  petitioner  is denied the equal protection of the laws, and is deprived of  his liberty without due process of law, and is  not released  even on bail, a condition  he  is  willing  to  fulfill,  although not required under the Constitution.</p>
<p>Those of us who believed in the great principles of freedom as indispensable element of human happiness, pinned their hopes for a better world on the victory of the forces of light, the standard bearers of democracy, the champions of individual  and collective liberties.  The  final victory was, after the most  tremendous exertions known to  humanity,  conclusively won on September 2,  1945.  The meaning and  validity of  those principles are  now under test in the present case.  The test is taking place not less than in the highest  tribunal of one of the proud nations which  contributed to victory with the heroism, gallantry, and martyrdom of uncounted thousands of her sons and daughters.  Bataan became a new symbol of liberty which fired the imagination, not only of millions of Filipinos, as Balintawak did half a century ago,  not only of our blood relatives such as Indonesians and other Malayan peoples scattered in the Indian and Pacific oceans, but of hundreds of millions of liberty-loving  souls all over the world.  If few cowards and mercenaries humbled themselves to  lick the boots  of the insolent enemy, in temporary ascendancy, to advance with the  betrayal their personal fortunes, innumerable rivals of Bonifacio and  Luna, of Jacinto  and Del Pilar, filled with their  unsung  gestes mountains  and valleys, keeping in wonder comrades in arms abroad, and, headed by Chief Justice Abad Santos, many  thousands of Filipino Martyrs faced death with the divine  serenity of those who  have faith in the Ideal.  Are  our hopes to shrivel and fade sooner than the tender petals of a beautiful orchid?  Is our unbounded faith in the blissful promises of liberty to be shaken  so soon by  disappointment? Are the principles for which we fought with other democracies  like multi-colored butterflies, flying beauties  while out  of our reach and dirty shreds of dead  matter in the hands of a boy?   Are they just deceitful dreams, mirages and  Illusions?</p>
<p>It is the duty of all of us to keep burning the torch of liberty,  collective  and individual.   The role of leadership our  people  assumed  in the fight  for  democracy in  this region of the globe has placed on our shoulders the burden of a great national and international responsibility,   The whole world is watching today the  gallant fight for independence  of  Nesiots,  our brethren of Java who  have followed with envious eyes our unremitting fight for the same ideal, initiated in the  latter part of the last century, and our gigantic strides towards the full attainment of our national  aspirations.   But, besides national dignity, the real  content of independence are the civil liberties of the individual  persons.   At the bottom  of national freedom are the individual freedoms. We blazed the trail of oriental freedoms.  After us, under  the perspicacious leadership of Gandhi, India  has been fighting for its  liberation for three decades.  Now  our kinsmen in  Java challenge boldly Dutch imperialism.  We hope  that eventually all the  Malayan race shall be freed from bondage  and shall regain its position of dignity among other races.   For God's sake, Jet us not recede nor retrace the steps already taken to make personal freedom,  which is the  basis of all freedoms, bloom in the glory of reality and ripen with the fullness of its magnificent meaning.</p>
<p align="center">X. CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>Our conclusions are:</p><ol>
<li>Petitioner is  actually deprived of liberty without due process of law, in flagrant  violation of the Bill of Rights of the Philippine Constitution, no charges having  been filed  against him for any offense.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li>His detention is not authorized by any government office or officer with  legal power to order it.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li>Petitioner  is,  therefore,  entitled as  a  matter  of absolute constitutional right to immediate unconditional release.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li>Having manifested his willingness to put bail for his release, the more reason there is for granting his  petition.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li> Under the provisions of section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 682, the People's Court has no discretion to deny a petition for release on bail, unless petitioner is  charged with a capital offense and the evidence of guilt is strong.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li> The People's Court cannot decide whether  the evidence  is strong in a case of capital offense, unless  said evidence is  presented.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li>Mere  statements  of  a prosecutor  are not  enough. Mere statements  are not evidence  according to  the Rales of  Court.  Statements  are not to be  confused  with evidence.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li>Not  a scintilla  of evidence  having been  presented against the petitioner,  the prosecutor refusing to  disclose any evidence, the People's Court  was in  duty bound  to grant the petition for release on bail, if the doctrines established  by the Supreme Court in  the Marcos, Banes and Sarnano cases, are to be followed.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li>  To construe  section 19 of Commonwealth Act No. 682 as granting the People's Court full discretion  to deny a petition for release on bail  is to make it unconstitutional.
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <br>
</li><li> The denial of the petition is violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed, not only by  the Constitution of the Philippines,  but also by  the Charter  of the United Nations, which is now  in full force in this country.
